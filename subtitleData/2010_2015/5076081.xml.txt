 What the hell ? Yo , dawg , is it snowing ? Sound the alarm , out of the yard ! Get everybody inside now ! It 's a very unique prison break . Could an artifact cause mantle displacement or spontaneous volcanoes ? Of course ! That 's why I hate volcanoes . They leave behind intense emotions . Oh , that 's why you hate volcanoes . You know , Pete thinks it 's a giant lava monster escaped from the Earth 's core . He thinks that or he 's hoping ? Just send me a sample to analyze . I 'll run through the database with whatever you 've got so far . Right . Ah ! Damn it ! Artie , are those shelves still unstable from the quakes last week ? Yeah , annoyingly so . And you are fixing them with a black light ? What ? No , no . This is Jerry Garcia 's black light . It 's for Claudia 's birthday party . It enhances the visuals of any artwork that it shines on . Ah , you 're still throwing the party . Yes , and your input on the event is still not required . I don 't know . Twenty-one is a really big deal , Artie . It 's a ... It 's a huge birthday . Trust me . I know Claudia and I planned the perfect party . That 's what I 'm worried about . I happen to have a great surprise lined up . Please tell me it 's not a clown . You know what ? Just solve the case . Come back in time for the party and I 'll call you if I find anything . All right . Just ... So there 's a U.S. Marshal here now . I 'm sure he 'll be telling his guys to search every gas station , residence , warehouse , outhouse , doghouse . You forgot henhouse . Ah , nice catch , marshal . I watch at least once a year . Uh , Mykes , this is Liam Napier , U.S. Marshal . Myka Bering , Secret Service . Warden says all the inmates who were in the yard are accounted for . Really ? Hey . He 's ... He 's with us . That 's , uh ... Jersey . Jersey ? Marshal . Wow . Dude , long time . What 's the ATF doing here ? Working with the Secret Service to track an incendiary device . What the hell kind of incendiary device makes molten lava ? Well , that 's what we 're here to figure out . Listen . We 've got this under control . I 'm sure you 've got other places to be , so we will call you if a prisoner shows up missing . What ? No , wait . Wait a minute . The warden said that everyone was accounted for out here but what about the main building ? We don 't know yet . They needed all hands on deck during the crisis so they had to shut the main building down . They 're still counting . So everyone 's focus was out here and with everyone 's eyes on the front door ... It would make it a lot easier for someone to sneak out the back . Maybe this wasn 't the actual prison break . It was a diversion . I 'll order a full sweep and get a head count of all the inmates . Get ' em going on that henhouse thing . I love that guy . Right . Yeah . Okay . Yes ! Great . Okay . What are doing there ? What ? Nothing ! Don 't you have a guitar lesson ? Oh , that was over like an hour ago . You probably lost track of time because you were too busy turning the solarium into a funeral home for Dead Heads . What ! Oh , no , no . There 's nothing going on in there . Yeah , the problem with hiding things behind glass doors is you can see through them . All right . It 's for your birthday party . You 're welcome . What ? Yeah , and I ... Yeah , I have all the great rock bands on vinyl . One of the few older technologies that your generation still actually respects . Plus , I have a very , very special , special surprise guest . Tell me it 's not a clown . Let 's just get one thing straight . Clowns happen to serve a very important psychological and socio-religious function in society since 2400 B.C. Artie , Artie , Artie . Thanks . Thank you for this . Okay , well ... Really , it 's ... I just already made plans to go get beers with Steve . No , you can 't just go to a bar . According to the state of South Dakota , at midnight , I can . No , no , no , it 's not that . Just ... Can 't you stay home ? Artie , when you met me , I was kid . I 'm an adult now . You know , age has nothing to do with adulthood . Look at Pete . Okay . Look . Yeah , you always do this . I 'm not just an old man . You act like I can 't make my own decisions . How many times have I I have something to say actually saved the world ? That 's vaguely intelligent . All right , you know what ? Just enough ! Look , if we 're gonna have this argument , at least just turn off the music so we can have the argument properly . What music ? Ah ! Just because it 's Beethoven 's first symphony does not mean it 's not music . And adults listen to classical music . Artie . There 's no music . Okay , see , that 's not good . Beethoven 's clock . That definitely looks like an escape route . I 'm guessing made by an artifact . While everybody else was busy in the yard , two convicts disappeared . Jonesy , put out an APB on two fugitives , Joe Barton and Rick Davis . I want wheels on the road and eyes on the dirt . If it 's orange and moves , I wanna know . Copy , marshal . This hole was made from the outside , just like the one in the yard . And this ... It 's volcanic ash . All right , it looks like Barton and Davis have someone on the outside . Someone with an artifact . Damn , I 've waited so long for that ! That 's not Griff . No , that 's Barton . He 's gonna make sure that we can afford that vacation we wanted . Where 's the thing ? So this is the magic bottle , huh ? Don 't open it . That stuff melted through those prison walls like nothing . Imagine what it could do to a bank vault . Or anybody that gets in our way . Davis is a member of the 3rd Street Turks , a crew deep into armed robbery and narcotics . Another Turk in his block is this upstanding gentleman , Adam Griff . Their last project together landed them here in our lovely hillbilly spa and resort . What about Joe Barton ? Bad man . Armed robbery , assault , attempted murder . A former Turk , but after a messy falling out , they parted ways . So Davis escaped with a deserter and not his fellow Turk , Griff . Doesn 't add up . Well , maybe Barton was trying to get back in . I 'm having Mr. Griff brought up . He should 've been here by now . You know , someone should keep an eye on our marshal . Pete ! Pete should stick with him . Dude , what is wrong with you ? Is there something about that guy you don 't like ? No ! No , no , no . It 's just that he 's ... You know , and ... You know , we don 't really ... Oh , my God , he 's your ex ! He is ? He is ! Yeah , he is ! I don 't think that that 's relevant . Dude , why didn 't you say so ? Because being stuck on a case with a guy that dumped me is not a dream assignment . In fact , I think I 've had this exact nightmare before . Okay , wait a minute . He dumped you ? Why would anyone do that ? I mean look at you . Looks , brains , good taste , a deep knowledge of guns and blowing things up . What 's not to love ? Do you need us to hate him ? Because we can hate him . No , no , no . Look , look , Liam ... He 's not a bad a guy . What happened between us , it wasn 't his fault and ... And I 'd really rather talk about this at another time that 's not now . Maybe we can talk about it when I 'm dead . Okay . Right ? Right . I will shadow Liam . Okay , we 're gonna go toss Barton and Davis ' cells far away from " Mr. Hunky " ex . Oh , he 's not that hunky . Oh , he 's hunky . Okay ? He 's me . I knew I was your type . Can it get any worse ? ATF and Secret Service seem like an odd mix . You worked with Steve long ? I know what you 're doing . You 're digging for intel on Steve , so ... You caught me . I 'm sneaky that way . I just wanna know how he 's doing . It 's been a while . We don 't exactly Skype every night . Well , you should 've thought of that before you dumped him . Right . I dumped him . My bad . It 's a big mistake . It 's huge ... For you . It 's great for Steve . He goes out a lot , you know . A lot , a lot , a lot of dating ! Oh , yeah , we call him " Social Steve . " Steve Jinks , right ? Well , I guess you never really knew Steve . I guess not . He did tell me about one guy though . What 's the name of the guy that he just started dating last week ? Oh , come on , you know the guy 's name . Steve just told me about him . It 's okay . Honestly , I 'm glad he has friends who stick up for him . You sure you got time for this ? I heard you got two cons on the run . Play nice , Griff . Secret Service here 's got a few questions for you . So ... Barton leaves your crew and Davis still breaks him out . Why ? No idea . Can I go now ? Seems like everybody kissed and made up . Turks finally learned how to forgive and forget . Yeah , right . Barton 'd be dead if he didn 't have ... If he didn 't have something that you wanted ? Information ? No . You 'd just kill him . Money . He 's got some of your stolen cash and now you 're groveling at his feet to get it . Hey , nobody takes our money . So this is about money . But it 's not your money . So , Barton 's trying to buy his way back in with his own stolen loot . He 's gonna show Davis where it is . Davis was supposed to take you . Wasn 't he ? But you got dropped at the last minute for Barton 's big bag of money . I don 't gotta tell you nothing . Maybe we should ask some of the other Turks in the prison ? Well , that 's a great idea . We could tell them everything that Griff here told us and they could just fill in the blanks . I didn 't tell you anything ! They 'd probably be very interested to know how helpful Griff was . I didn 't help you ! You guessed ! I would probably leave that part out . I 'm very forgetful that way . Yeah ? Well then , I 'll them the truth . You 've been here talking to us . Who do you think they 'll believe ? Look . Just tell us where Barton and Davis are going . We 'll forget this little conversation ever happened . So , this stuff with Liam . That must suck , huh ? Yeah . I remember when Amanda and I split up . Oh ! That was ... That was tough stuff , man . Yeah ? Uh-huh . I mean , I guess what I 'm trying to say is I can relate . I mean , sure Amanda and I had a chance to put things to rest . And now we have a newer , slightly weirder relationship . Maybe this is just a chance for you to make amends . Do you really wanna talk about this ? I know . Doesn 't sound like me , does it ? Well , I 've been getting in touch with my sensitive side . Knock , knock , Steve . I 'm home . The thing is , I thought that Liam was ... You know , the one . Been there , man . Been there ! Then he started lying . Right , well , you 're definitely not the guy to lie to . Heck , I got to look away every time you ask me for a piece of gum and I only have three left . Jinksy . What are you doing ? Looking for a tunnel . Haven 't you ever seen Shawshank ? Yeah . Hey , hey , check this out . " Hey , babe . I can 't wait to see you " so we can be together forever . " Davis had a girlfriend . Uh , Anna . Now , she might be the accomplice . It 's possible . Oh , listen to this one . " Hey , babe , the east sees you rise " above the walls around my heart . " Surrounded , slumbering in the cellar at noon " away from the midnight moon , " mournful Monday " awake with thee . " See , Steve , poetry sucks ' cause it doesn 't make any sense . No , no , no , no , no . She 's trying to hide something . So , what , you think it 's a code ? Yeah . We need to figure out the cipher . Uh , transposition , move each letter to the next one in the alphabet . U-l-F-F-B-T-U . Sounds Klingon . No . No . No ? Okay , I don 't know . So what do we ... Rearrange the sentences ? " Sees surrounded around the east " ? Wait , wait , wait . " Flag on the plain . " Look at these . They look like they 're framing the words . Hold on , man . Prisons don 't censor with X-acto knives . " East , " " wall , " " cellar , " " noon , " " Monday . " Now that 's a poem I can understand . All right . Present from a piano teacher to young Ludwig . " A clock of most exquisite decor . " Wait , our clock doesn 't have a bust . See ? Uh-huh , yeah . That 's why we couldn 't neutralize it . We have to goo the other half . Yes , all we have to do is find it anywhere on the planet Earth . Well , allow me to show you how I can be hip enough to hang ten on the web yet adult enough to not need a clown . Yep ! Got it . Age hasn 't slowed me down a bit . Bravo ! That was fast . Yeah . I used WebCrawler to index sites with the recently updated keyword " bust " and then after remembering to turn safe search back on , cross-referenced with the image of the clock . Like you taught me , sensei , only a little more 2013 than 1979 . 1979 ! The year Emmett Kelly died . Famous clown . So where are we going ? Just donated to a gallery called Art of the Bay . Art of the Bay . Art of the Bay , Art of the Bay , Art of the Bay , Art of the Bay ! We 're going to Boston . Excellent ! We 'll snag the artifact , stop the tune-age and you 'll still have time to show me where you threw the first crate of tea into the harbor . Good one ! I didn 't see that coming , you little ... It changed again . To what , news and weather ? A little bit of his third . It 's going through all the opuses . We 've got to find it fast ! It 's getting louder ! Yeah , we gotta find it fast . Well , it looks like Griff was right . With all this falling ash , they must be around here somewhere . Wait , there it is . That 's the bag Griff was talking about . They left the cash . Looks like it 's been raining lava . It 's a cell phone ! Liam , the truck . She 's trapped . Might be the accomplice . This must be Davis . Door 's welded shut with lava . This is more than just an incendiary device , isn 't it ? Uh , I have to take this call so you should probably go help that poor woman in the truck . Okay . Turns out Davis had a pen pal . She might have the artifact . Yeah , we found her and we found Davis , too . He 's dead . Uh , what about Barton ? Well , he probably took off with the artifact but , Pete , the weird thing is that he left the cash here . So if he 's not after the money , then what is it ? No idea but , Pete , he has no problem using this artifact to kill . Rick got the money and ... He was gonna kill Barton . He said he didn 't need him anymore . There was a fight . Barton got the bottle , and ... Oh ! He buried him in lava . Bottle ? What bottle ? This old copper jug . Belonged to my Nana Paccia . She just passed . I got all of her junk from Italy . So where is Barton now ? He grabbed my phone and locked me in the truck . I don 't know where he went after that . I swear . Is this your phone ? Yeah . It 's gotta be the copper jug , right ? I mean , from Italy , shoots lava ... They 've definitely had their share of volcanoes . Okay , the most recent call was to a Paulie 's Diner . Barton made it . It 's a 24-hour diner on the edge of town . The Turks hang out there . Barton obviously has an agenda . Yeah , taking out Turks . What the hell can do this to a guy ? Uh ... Hey , Liam , can you give us a sec ? Sure . Secret Service . Emphasis on the " secret . " Fine . Okay , so the bottle 's from Italy , right ? Maybe , uh ... Pompeii , an entire city destroyed at once . Pretty powerful , right ? And the fear , sadness , loss . All those emotions flying around sounds like artifactish circumstances . Right , so , it 's like a lava flamethrower . You just point it and it burns through . You point it at a person , it does ... This . So , you recognize him ? Yeah , that 's the guy asking everybody about Chris . Okay , Chris . Who 's Chris ? No idea . I 've been here over a year . We don 't have any Chrises . So he heads right in there , into the kitchen to talk to Paulie , heard some yelling and then he was heading out again and that 's when Tattoo over there saw him . Okay , so they knew each other ? I guess so . I mean , they got into an argument . Tattoo pulls out a knife , and I 'm no dummy . I got out . Next thing you know , Tattoo is covered in molten lava ? Yeah . How the heck does that ... Global warming . Thanks for your help . Don 't forget to recycle . It looks like this guy Chris is Barton 's next target . Well , then we need to get the ... Can I talk to you a sec ? Excuse me . Look , I 'm trying to catch a fugitive and I can 't do that if I don 't know what I 'm dealing with . Look , I told you , incendiary device . It is an incendiary device that drowns people in lava . Nothing in the world does that . Well , there 's a lot more in the world than you think . Cryptic , helpful . Are we working together on this or not ? Liam , things would be a lot easier for both of us if you weren 't here . Speak for yourself , Steve . Well , good luck with your top secret national security spy versus spy . Where are you going ? My people , who share information with me by the way , just located the crew 's safe house . I think I might go catch a fugitive . You have to go after him . No , no . My personal stuff cannot get in the way of this job . Agreed , but if he finds Barton , he 'll find the artifact . You know him best . Stick with him . Pete and I are going to try and track down this Chris guy . Yeah , but I don 't ... Look , dude , there 's baggage . Okay ? I get it . But for now , we 're stuck with your ex and you know him better than any of us . Clearly he 's not going anywhere and if he finds that artifact without us , it 's gonna be a lot more difficult to explain . And it could kill him . All right , the coast is clear . Good , wouldn 't want to be caught breaking into a charity . That would really hurt my street cred . You ... What ? Nothing . Joking . How loud is that music ? Ooh ... So loud . I 've got Beethoven 's 8th going on now , which is highly overrated . It 's making me a little irritable . What 's your usual excuse ? You just made a joke about that , didn 't you ? No , I didn 't . Yeah . We good ? Artie , wait . I ... I think ... Let 's go . Oh ! The alarm 's just ... Why didn 't you do that first ? Oh , this is my fault . This is all your fault . Where is it ? Get ... On the ... Yep . Just like in the movies . Yeah . This is cutting it a little too close . The music is drowning out all other sound and ... I gotta ... I think I should just go . You should ... Wait . Wait , what now ? No , I 'm a liability . You can finish up . I 'll wait in the car . No , you 're doing fine . I 'm the one who is almost getting us caught . And this isn 't slowing us up at all . Yeah . It 's not even remotely funny . It 's a little funny . According to the photo on the web , it should be right here . Things are missing . Things are missing ? Probably sold . So , I 'm looking for ... Manifest . Yeah . Okay , manifest . " Bronze statue , $ 490 . " No . " Wall painting , fruit , $ 375 . " No ! " Marble Aphrodite , $ 85 . " They must not have known who it belonged to . Yeah . The buyer , Mrs. Viola Adams , from Beacon Park Music Academy . Her address is ... Artie , what 's wrong ? Are you okay ? Beethoven 's Piano Concerto No. 5 . Why has it switched to the concertos ? Unless ... Uh , what ? Unless what ? Ah , number five was Beethoven 's last public appearance , because after that ... he went deaf . Thank you . Pete , I think I figured out why ... Really ? Well , it was just sitting there . I think I figured out why nobody knows a guy named Chris . So what 's up ? Well , there was this waitress . She used to work here . She quit around a year ago . The same time that Barton was arrested . Her name was Christina Robertson . Okay . Let 's go . Coming . Coming . Hi , Chris . It 's been a while . Look , I let you join me here , are we gonna talk about this , or what ? I 'm not here to talk about my feelings . That brings back memories . Okay , so you 're just gonna follow me around in case I find out what 's actually going on , is that it ? There are things that I can 't tell you . I 'm trying to protect you . Right . That must be why you told your pals that I dumped you . We 're trailing a fugitive . Are we really gonna do this now ? Why not ? We never actually did it . You know , why don 't we just check on the game . The Entune has all the latest scores ... Steve , you never even said goodbye . You just left . Gone . Okay , fine , then let 's break up now . You lied to me , constantly . You 're a human lie detector . And it was not constantly . Yes , sometimes I lied . You really want the truth all the time ? Okay . Uh , the only thing you can cook is lasagna , and even that sort of sucks . That tea you drink smells like cat pee . And skinny jeans do not look good on you . Like that ? Yes , yes ! It 's a start . Come on . Nobody wants that much truth . I just ... I just wanted you to like me . I loved you . Yeah . We had plenty of love , but not much like . Different thing . And I wanted to like you but you made that so hard . I ... Felt like you were constantly on the lookout . It was terrifying . I was always scared I 'd screw up . It made me screw up even more . Look ... I am sorry . Okay ? I hate that I can tell and I hate that I care so much but this is who I am . The thing is , if I can 't make it work with you . If I couldn 't ... Then I can 't make it work with anyone . Just have to make my peace with it . Chris Robertson ? Yeah . Uh , but I 'm on my way out . We have reason to believe you might be in danger . Can we come in ? Um , sure . Thanks . So you 're not part of the crew ? No . I don 't want anything to do with that life or those people . Then why is Barton after you ? I told you , I don 't know anyone named Barton . Pete . Volcanic ash . Why are you lying to us ? This is the safe house ? You were expecting beach front ? Looks like we 're too late . Yeah . He 's already tossed this place . Barton 's definitely been here . Times , dates . Could be a delivery schedule . But deliveries of what ? Ah , there is a missing page . Lyon Armored Car . It 's a pick up schedule . The next pick up 's in a mall parking garage , about five miles from here in 30 minutes . So , Barton didn 't hurt you ? That 's a first . Did he ... Did he threaten you ? Is there someone else you 're trying to protect ? Like your son , maybe ? I don 't have a son . Look Chris , I was a teenager once . The dirty clothes , the heavy metal . It 's all part of the package . How long has your son been running with the Turks ? You know , he 's targeting the Turks . Your son could be in real danger . Is that it ? Did Barton come here looking for your son so he could hurt him ? Look Chris , you need to talk to us , because we can find Barton and stop him . We won 't let him hurt your son but you have to ... Please , stop . You don 't understand , okay ? He would never hurt Kyle . Mykes , that 's why the money was left at the lake . This isn 't about money . It 's about Kyle . Yes . Barton is Kyle 's father , isn 't he ? He 's trying to save him . Inside every box , some new piece of crap . My aunt collects a lot of crap . Been trying to get her on that show . You know the one , people collect the crap ? Hoarders ? Yeah . They pay a lot ? I like money . No , uh ... This particular piece of crap is sentimental . Not worth anything at all . Trust me . So , um ... You guys are going through a lot of trouble for something that 's just crap . Well , you 're not the only one with a crazy aunt . Yeah , well . I 'm gonna dump these and I 'll be right back . Oh , we haven 't checked that box yet . Hey ! Artie ! Hey ! Bluto 's getting away . He 's heading upstairs . Aah ! Artie , are you okay ? Claudia , I 'm deaf . Don 't worry . Stay . Give it up , chum . It 's over . Okay . I 'm sorry . I just ... I thought maybe this thing could pay for the surgery my aunt needs . She 's got a bad heart . And , uh ... She 's really old . Yeah ! No mercy ! Ah ! Pete and Myka are on their way . We 'll wait for the backup . This is it , kid . Graduation . You 're part of the family , right ? That must be Barton 's son . Now , waste this rent-a-cop punk . We can 't let this happen . Let 's go . Move it . - Whoa ! Whoa ! - Bart ! Where 's Davis ? Dead . I 'd rather not kill you too , but I will . I 'm taking my kid . Are you trying to be a dad all of a sudden ? I came here to protect you . These guys protect me . They look out for me , they 're here for me . Look at me . I won 't let you make the same mistakes that I did . You don 't want to go to jail , or worse . That 's touching , Barton . But you should know by now that no one leaves the crew . Freeze ! United States marshal ! Guns down ! You brought the cops , Barton ? That was stupid . Goodbye , Kyle . Kyle ! Dad ! Go ! That bullet was meant for you , Kyle . Trust me , these people are not your friends . They 're not your family . Ah ! Dad ! Help ! Help ! Someone get us out of here . We have to bag that bottle . Before Barton and Kyle get roasted . Liam , get to high ground ! Get out of here before the lava traps you . I can get out over there . I 'm good . Go ! What are you gonna do , little man ? Ah ! And this ... Is for my ankle . Hurry . Yeah ? I can hear . Yeah ? I can hear everything ! I can hear you moaning . Oh , my God ! You 're moaning . Yeah . Oh , sorry . Okay . Yeah . Sorry . My ankle 's killing me . Well , Claudia . You know what 'll make you feel really good right now ? Is a clown . Who knew a Prius was so badass ? I couldn 't leave without saying goodbye . You 'd never let me hear the end of it . Bet you 're gonna miss getting all those scores . You still expect me to believe this is just an incendiary device ? Here 's a shot in the dark . You work for a secret organization that collects supernatural objects and locks them away to protect mankind . Why does everyone want to talk today ? Come on . Is your life always this crazy ? It 's about right for a Monday . Mykes . Wait , you 're not thinking what I think you 're thinking , are you ? I never think that far ahead . Look , don 't blame me if you get swallowed up by lava . Totally blaming you . Dad ! Hold my leg ! All right ! Okay . Ah ! Okay . We have got to stop cutting these things so close . Yeah . Yeah . Aw , honey , you should go talk to him . What am I supposed to say ? Before this , he was just ... a guy in jail . He 's your dad . He loves you . Look , I don 't know , Kyle , but he did ... He did take a bullet for you , right ? I mean , I think that rates a goodbye . Don 't you ? Risking everything to put you on the right path . I think it 's worth getting to know him . Even if it 's just on visiting days . Trust me , kid . I know about these things . Grab the chance while you 've still got it . Well , uh ... Local PD is rounding up the Turks . The marshal got his man , we got our thingy . I 'd say all in all , it 's a pretty good day . I talked to Artie . The bottle is called uh , an amphora , and it belonged to a merchant from Pompeii who survived Vesuvius . You are not listening to a word that I 'm saying , are you ? I really like Liam , Mykes . You know , I sure hope those two crazy kids can work it out . What do you think they 're talking about , huh ? Guns ? Manhunts ? Gladiator movies . So , about that ridiculous theory ... Don 't worry . I 'll keep your secret . Anybody asks , you work for the ATF . Thanks . You know , you knew there was no way off that car . You just didn 't want me to risk anything . As it turns out , I 'm starting to think sometimes it 's a really good thing you can tell when people are lying . Thank you . Turns out , I 'd rather not know that you think my favorite tea smells like cat urine , so ... See ? And by the way , nobody looks good in skinny jeans . You 're lying again . Okay , fine . Bradley Cooper . I 'm relentless . I 'm sorry , Liam . Really terrible at goodbyes . Well , Jersey , I 'm just glad we had a chance to do it right . Much better color . Okay , I 'm willing to admit that one or two of the posters will actually look good in my room . Okay , all of them . Artie kind of nailed it . Yeah , he really did . Happy birthday , Claud . I heard all about you and your little adventure , sir . You run into your ex-boyfriend and you don 't text me ! Oh , bad , bad gay bestie . Brought you a present . Forgiven . I still want dirt , though . Do I get to meet him , are you back together ? Details . Repercussions . Uh , there is no dirt . Uh , we said good bye and that 's it . Really ? That 's it ? It was a really good goodbye . Steve . Oh , my God ! You slept with him . Can we please not ... Oh , yeah ! The gay me is as much of a player as the straight me . Is there a difference ? Ms. Donovan . May I ask you to direct your attention to the stage . Please , just no clown . I can 't believe I 'm saying this out loud , but ladies and gents , please welcome The Runaways ' Cherie Currie . What did you do ? Well , I hear there 's a birthday girl in the crowd tonight . Claudia , you want to come up and join me up here ?

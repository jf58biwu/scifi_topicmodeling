 And ... . Go ! We 're fast on the take-off guys Better employ the brakes , please ! Right ! Man , brakes would totally defeat the purpose of my ultra-speed , aerodynamic nose-cone ! Nosecone deployed . Brakes ! BRAKES ! Hey ! Shift weight on the turns ! We 're unstable ! Wrong ! We gotta power THROUGH the turns ! Listen up . Chuck , ease on the brakes . Dutch , retract the nose-cone Julie , lean AGAINST the turn and Texas , stop pushing ! and 3 , 2 , 1 ... let 's go ! Killerjump guys ! Yeah ! We totally conquered that hydrochute ! Now I 'm gonna punch it 's face ! So cold ! Is it me , or did the sun just go out . Look ! Everyone , out of the water ! I thought it was July . Can someone please hand Texas a towel . Hoho , it 's gonna be a cold one today in Motorcity I 've send in a team of friendly KaneCo. representatives down to your wretched sinkhole to offer you a new life up here with me , Abraham Kane . Join me , won 't you ? Or , freeze to death . The choice is yours ... Big surprise , it 's Kane . But how is he doing it ? That is an excellent question for ... Chuck You need to drink your anti-freeze Roth . It 's for your own good . Chuck ? Chuck ! Yeah uh , uuuh , I don 't know ! Uhm , uhm , I 'm working on it ! Hehe Let 's set out guys . We need to find the source of this cold-front before it freezes all of Motorcity ! Oh , Claire , uuh , looks like I can 't drive you home right now , you gonna be alright hanging around here for a while ? Okay , like , exactly , how long do you mean by " a while " ? Weell ... I 've never been down here alone ! And it kinda smells . That 's the steakhorn casserole I 've made this morning ! You and I are going to have a heck of a lunch Missy ! Wait a second , I 've just realized something Chuck . I need you stay here at HQ . You do ? Well , yeah . Don 't you need to stay behind and track the storm ? Well actually I could probably just do ... No I 'm afraid I need you stay behind and work from the .. uuh the big computer dial ! Aah , uuh , the BCD , yeeah I uh , I have to use that , don 't I ? I don 't get it . Why can 't he do his nerd-thing from the car ? So why do you wanna freeze rats Mister Kane ? For the last time . The rats are the people in Motorcity . People like Mike Chilton . Oh THOSE rats ! Yees . My team of specialists will be collecting these miscreants and bring them up here to Deluxe , where I 'll force them to spend every waking hour slaving away in my factories . Not only do I get complete control over Motorcity , but I get free labor . But why would you want rats in the factories , they 're terrible workers ... Tooley ! Why don 't you just ... Ready to move out Mister Kane . Good . Report here first . I 've got just the man to carry your bags . How 's it looking at nine o 'clock Dutch ? Man , I can 't see anything in this stuff . Jules ? Nothing back here . Texas . Texas hasn 't hit anything yet ! Mike , I 've tracked the coldfront to the western quadrant , just a few blocks from you ! Head north-west . Nice Chuck , keep an eye on it . Yeah ! Oh these are just some simple compression algorithms I mean I can tell you all about it . Hehehe ... if you like algorithms . So is this what you guys do around here for fun ? I collect unique motoroil for fun . I think you will find this an extremely rewarding hobby . What do you do with it ? Oh all sorts of exciting things ! You can look at it and uh ... Well you just look at them , mostly . Supercool . Uhm , hey I 'm gonna go check things out over there . Ease up guys , snow 's getting heavy . We must be close . Roth . Little help ? Oh , what the heck is that ? Talk to me Chuckles . Uh , looks like it sending super-charged cold particles all over the atmosphere . It 's turning the whole city into a giant freezer ! Alright team . Hang back , I 'll go in for a look . Alright Burners , let 's hang back while Mike goes in for a look . Oh , it can fly . Not good . Talk with me guys . We 've got you covered ! Floored ! Burners , I ... Mike ! Come again , we can 't hear you ! Trying ... stick down He 's going to try to wear it down ! You said " bring it down " ? Guys , we 're losing him ! Don 't worry , I 'll handle it . Stop stop stop ! Texas , Dutch , stop ! He 's ... . gone . Mike ? Mike ! Do you read me ? I got nothing ! No read on Mike OR the machine ! I can 't track its signal with all this interference ! Of course we wouldn 't have lost it if SOMEBODY wasn 't driving like a jerk . Don 't blame yourself Julie . She wasn 't . She was blaming you ! Save your wind fellas , man , we 're gonna need that energy ! Yeah . And we have to focus on the ONE guy down here who can lead us out of danger . Me ! Texas . Now ! Let 's go find Mike . Burners . Do you read me ? Come in ! Burners . Hey ! You guys didn 't follow me ! There 's a perfectly good reason for that . Nobody WANTS to follow you . Okay smart-guy , let 's hear your big idea for finding Mike . Alright . Let 's say this is Motorcity . This is the Climator ? And these are civilians . If we 're gonna save them and find Mike , we need to use some sort of heat magnifier to clear some of the snow ! Otherwise ... Otherwise bluh ! Your plan is stupid and everybody gets burried alive ! Wow easy fellas ! Come on now I 've got an idea everyone will like ! We 're gonna find the Climator and Mike , using simple everyday mathematical triangulation ! That 's the dumbest idea I 've ever heard . Yeah it 's a little convoluted . Why won 't you let me talk ? Why why why ... Why are you always ... You 're stupid you don 't even know ... Hey hey hey ! Texas punches good . Oh no , not Texas ! Hey , hey ! Everyone , check it out ! I 'd say he went that way ! Woah , warm , that 's more like it . Hello . Hellooo ? Hey . Freezing stranded guy out here . I need help . Hold it right there ! Oh man ! The trail ends here . Where do we go now ? Okey-dokey . We 've tried everything else , now we 're gonna listen to Texas ' gut . I call him Mister Six-Pack . Mister Six-Pack says we 're going that way ! For the last time , I am not following you OR your gut ! Frankly , I 'd rather find Mike by myself ! Oh , you 're freakin right ! ? Fall in line ? Dutch ! Both of you , stop ! Guys , this isn 't the time for a power-struggle ! Mike is out here somewhere ! Yeah , and he wants me to lead us to him ! What ? ! Oh ? Texas , Dutch , just listen to .. Zip it Miss Deluxe . Oooh you did not just call me that . Uuh , I think I did ! Deluxe ! Stop cutting me off ! You know , this is exactly what I was talking about . Shhshsh ! What 's that ? Uh , guys ? Is that what it sounds like ? Yeah , and no sign of Mike ! Oh you 're telling me , that thing ATE Mike ? ! Texas wants revenge ! Let 's go kick this giant refrigator 's butt ! So , Mike Chilton , Deluxe 's most wanted criminal . Where are your friends ? They went to Grandma 's for the weekend . Where are the rest of the Burners ? ! Help me search the perimeter . Who 's staying behind and watch him ? Get the new guy to do it . That guy ? He 's a complete half-wit . Eh new guy ! Keep an eye on that prisoner while we have a look-around . Oooh boy , a prisoner ! And DON 'T talk to him . I will not let KaneCo. down ! He 's Mister Kane 's right-hand man . How dumb could it be ? Okay Dutch . I need you to access the menu and face of the Climator . I don 't see any sort of manual override . The handbook says it 's gotta have a manual override feature . Well , maybe you and the handbook could come down here and show it to me . That is if it 's okay with your girlfriend , Claire ! Uh , Texas ! Dude , do you mind ? I 'm trying to remove the netlocks ! They could help us locate Mike ! You shouldn 't be moving ANY locks while I 'm trying to smash this machine . Now help me and get out of my way ! You mean this wire ? No ! That didn 't work ! Forget this ! Take that ! Texaaas ! I 've got it ! It 's still weather-izing ! Get to the rides , now ! Climator has been breached . Defense system have been activated . Oh ? Precipitation is now : " Giant , ten-foot icicles " . Burners . Are you actually making it worse ? It 's like you 're doing my work FOR me ! Incoming ! Roth ! Someone ordered a tow-truck ? Jacob ! I 've never been so happy to see your old wrinkly face ! Uuuh , thanks . We lost Mike . And we 've put all of Motorcity in danger . It gets worse . While we were arguing , Mike send us this message . Burners , do you read me ? Come in . That 's all there is . How are we supposed to find him with that ? How did things go so wrong ? ! Okay here 's the thing : it 's like you guys are trying to dress somebody , BUT you 're all picking out different types of clothes that don 't match . You 're totes not coordinating . That 's actually pretty spot-on . Now , we can sit here and feel sorry for ourselves or we can get out there and find our friend ! I know where he is . Tooley ! The greatest god in the world ! I gotta admit , you are doing a bang-up job . You really got some muscle on ya . Thanks for noticing . It 's a shame those other KaneCo. guys don 't respect you . You should hear what they say behind your back ! What did they say , hey you know I 'm not supposed to talk to you ! Anyone can see your talents are wasted on those people . Shut your mouth ! We know Mike passed Michigan and 12th we can start tracking him from there ! You know , I may not make it back . Wait what , you 're leaving ? ! Again ? ! I said , I may not ... Look , you can 't leave me here again , okay ? I 'll die of weirdness ! Okay , I 'm gonna go now . I bet Kane doesn 't appreciate you ! Don 't you EVER speak Mr. Kane 's name again ! Does Kane even talk to you outside of work ? You know .. you ... QUIT THAT All I 'm saying is , you 're obviously ... Get him ! ... the strongest of the bunch juuust not the brightest . Ah , don 't mind if I do . Mike ! You 're okay ? Get me to Mutt . Ah , Mister Kane , guess what ? I 've been produckve ! That 's nice Tooley . We built the campfire , made snowangels , had a fistfight , caught Mike Chilton , climbed up ... You WHAT ? ! I climbed up a tree ? You caught Mike Chilton ? ! Yeah , but he got away . Couldn 't gone far though ! Get me control over that Climator ! Hello , girl ! You missed me ? Oh no , it 's back . Everyone help me dig out Mutt ! Creating warmfront . Huh . That feels like ... Warm air ! Mike ! I think Kane is causing two different air pressure systems to collide so he can make ... TORNADOES ! After it guys ! Creating " Tornado " . Creating " Tornado " . Creating " Tornado " . I 'm safely on the ground , I 'm safely on the ground . Julie , use your accelerator jets to get above Mutt ! Oh please tell me you 're not thinking what I think you 're thinking . Creating " Horrifying eletrical storm " . I have to time this juust right . Hold it steady Julie ! Follow my lead ! Mike ! We can do that . No problem ! The lightning is the best punch this thing has . Any way to make it work for us ? We can try to harvest the lightning with our cars ! Only if we wanna completely fry ourselves ! Any way to make it NOT fry us ? We can use some of those antennas as lightningrods ! But , there 's still a 50 % chance that we 'll be cooked alive ! Love those odds ! Julie , you run your holograms and get Texas within striking distance , it 's time to show this honking thing who runs things around here ! Got the lightning ! Holos ready ! Texas ready ! Not enough for ya huh ? Hold it steady Dutch ! Got it ! Now Texas ! Whuzzah Texas ! Dutch ! Chilton ... Good call on the lightningrods . Good call on the snag-and-fry . Nice take-down ! You did good too Cindy . It 's Julie . I 'm so glad you 're back Mike . You have NO idea what it was like without you . Thanks Dutch . I missed you too . Yeah , speaking of which , maybe it 's time we made this whole second-command-thing official . You know just so people know who 's in charge if you ever go missing again . Hhm , we will talk about that . Yeah ! We 're gonna talk about it ! Well , it 's been real hanging out down here , can I get back to civilization now ? Oh let me guess , Chuck went on about algorithms again , didn 't he ? Chuck ? ! Yeah , Chuck is the LEAST weird thing about this place . I think you 're making progress . Alright listen up Burners , now that I 've got my team firing on all cylinders again , we 've got one last piece of unfinished business . Seriously ? ! And ... Go ! Let 's get this baby moving ! Faster ! You got it ! Guys ... But not too fast ! Texas ! We 're tipping ! Guys ... - Subs by Cracker -

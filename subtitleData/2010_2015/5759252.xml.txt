Zupan has some rather passionate fans , followed him from whatever slav island birthed him . Bloody barbarians if you ask me . What 's their deal ? They ate a guy once . A ref red-carded Zupan in a rather tight match . Cops found the poor bastard the next morning . Hands gnawed to the nubs . Nose chewed off . Had an eye missing . From what they could tell , it had been sucked out of his head . They thought it might have been an animal attack , save for the numbers carved in his chest ... a four and a five . All right .

If we call your name , hit the showers and report to the team doctor for a physical . And rent a suit .

Well , then let 's talk about Andres Galan 's party . That 's the real mission , right ? Congratulations , Bravo . You 've determined the obvious . Before bleeding out in an alley , that asset you had was employed as a satellite engineer at Galan 's company Unafonica . - Less obvious ? - Eh . So what 's Galan into exactly ? He 's involved with an international syndicate that 's had influence in a range of global disturbances : The Dubai debt standstill , the BCCI scandal , and a number of silent coup d 'etat . They 've generally kept clear of the U.S. , but we have good reason to believe that a domestic event is imminent . So you need me to get intel on this event . Five months ago , Unafonica launched a communication satellite . On its face , nothing suspicious . They have 14 in orbit , but he 's kept this one off the books . We think it 's being used to facilitate private transmissions between him and his buddies . You can catch me puking on a third-generation Nazi from 100 miles up , but we can 't figure out a way to tap a phone call ? Not without knowing the satellite 's frequency codes . See , before our asset was killed , he found out the codes were rotated every two months and then disseminated to representatives . One of whom is this man . Gideon Khan . Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Terracor Energy . It 's a natural gas concern out of Israel . Also a member of Galan 's club . And he 's on the guest list tomorrow night . So you think that 's where they 'll make the exchange ? Yes , and our window of intercept is very small . Khan is booked on a red-eye back to Tel Aviv . He 'll be leaving straight after the party . So you 'll need to locate him while he 's there , access his tablet , and copy the codes . - Without him realizing it ? - Khan is a diabetic . A high dose of insulin will put him into shock , incapacitating him , giving you a window to access the data . You can do this , Bravo . Or not . And then your brother gets to keep his position as resident speed bag at Chino . Come on . Let 's get you a suit . [ Hip-hop music ] The stars are out tonight for the L.A. Riot 's 2014 kickoff party , and there is reason to celebrate . Only four years after founding the league 's newest expansion team , Riot owner Andres Galan saw his team finish in the top half of the table . But a pall has been cast over tonight 's proceedings by the loss of star defender , Gregor Zupan . Thank you . - Damn . - Say again ? Didn 't catch that . Everything all right out there ? Yeah , good . Heading in . Enjoying the view ? - What are you doing here ? - I 'm your plus-one . You didn 't think we 'd trust you to do this alone . You envy these people ? Little bit . Trust me , this life gets old . How would you know ? Once upon a time , I lived it . 9 : 00 . Let 's see if he 'll let me buy him a drink . Date walk out on you already ? You can borrow one of mine .

[ Laughs ] This is a new recruit , Tony Bravo . - Mr. Galan . - Ah . When I hear that the man who knocked out Zupan has been advanced to the second round , it makes me wonder if my coach is secretly on the rival team 's payroll . For the record , that was an accident . An expensive accident . I 'm paying Zupan $ 2 million a year . With the insurance you got on a guy like that , I figure you 'll come out ahead .

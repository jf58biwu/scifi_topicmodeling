 Captions synched for the Hearing Impaired to : Tron.Legacy.2010.DVDRip.XviD-EVO * = Music or songs Lovingly cooked by " Bake Master " Kevin Flynn : The Grid . A digital frontier . I tried to picture clusters of information , as they moved through the computer . What did they look like ? Ships , motorcycles ? Were the circuits like freeways ? I kept dreaming of a world , I thought I 'd never see . And then , one day . Sam : You got in . Kevin : Ha , ha , ha , that 's right , man . I got in . Kevin : And the world was more beautiful than I ever dreamed . And also , more dangerous than I ever dreamed . Get in bed now , come on . Now , I met a brave warrior . - Tron . - Ba , ba , bom , bom , bommm . Kevin : TRON ! Sam : He fights for the users . Kevin : He sure does . Oh man , he showed me things that no one had ever imagined . Here at least . Disc battles fought in spectacular arenas . Cycles that raced on ribbons of light . - So radical , and together , - Sam : You built the grid . Kevin : We built a new grid . With programs and users . Now , I couldn 't be in there all the time . So , I created a program in my own image . That could think , like you and me . And I called him , CLU . Codified Likeness Utility . Kevin : That 's right . And CLU , Tron and I , we built the system where all information was free , And hope , beautiful . And then , one day . Something happened . Something ... extraordinary . A miracle . What was it ? That 'll have to wait until next time . How ' bout I get to work . I 'm wanna go with you , Dad . Yeah , well . One day , you will . I promise . To the grid ? Good night , Sam . All right , what do you say tomorrow , you and I hit the arcade ? You can have a crack at the old man 's high score . First games on me . Can we play doubles ? Sam : On the same team ? We 're always on the same team . ( Sound of motorcycle revving ) ( Reporter on Television ) Good evening , our lead story . ENCOM CEO and video game Icon , Kevin Flynn . has disappeared . He was best known for designing Tron , and Space Paranoids . The two best selling video games in history . Flynn took ownership of ENCOM in 1982 . And the company skyrocketed to the top of the tech industry . But things changed in 1985 . With the untimely death of Flynn 's wife , the mother of his young son , Sam . Recently ENCOM board members have been troubled by the reports of Flynn 's erratic even obsessive behavior . With Flynn missing , the company is now in Chaos . This afternoon ENCOM 's board moved to seize control from Flynn 's partner , Alan Bradley . Vowing to return the company to profitability . Loyal to the end , Bradley maintains his belief that Flynn is not missing . And is instead pursuing his dream of quote : " A digital frontier to reshape the human condition " . Kevin : In there is a new world . In there is our future . In there , is our destiny . Reporter : Even Flynn 's most ardent supporters are now acknowledging a difficult truth . Kevin Flynn may have simply , run away . And while Flynn 's loyalists hope for his imminent return . There is perhaps no one ... . He 's coming . He promised . Kevin 's mother : Sam , you have to eat . Let go of me . Kevin 's mother : Sam . Reporter : What will become of Flynn 's legacy , and the future of ENCOM . Reporter : Will most likely depend on what becomes of this now orphaned little boy . - Kevin 's Mother : SAM ! Kevin 's Mother : SAM , come back . ( Police siren wails ) ( Police siren wails behind ) ( Bike skids to stop ) ( Lets out quick breath ) ( Buttons beep when pressed ) ( Sound of wheels cranking , door clicks as it unlocks ) Sam : Well that is a big door . Woman : Welcome everybody , please settle . I know it 's late so I 'll skip the pleasantries and hand things over to our chairman . Richard Mackey ( Board members clap ) Thank you , thank you . Thank you , Claire . Tonight I am pleased to announce that ENCOM 's last fiscal year , was our most profitable , ever . Yes . And at midnight tonight , the 12th version of our flagship operating system will hit the shelves . Around the world . Richard : I 'm sure it comes as no surprise , who we have to acclaim . The head of our software design team . A man who 's father own uh , notable history with ENCOM , helped make this company , what it is today . ( Knocks on table ) Edward Dillinger . Well done . Richard : We will be making our Debut on Tokyo 's Nikkei index . ENCOM 's stock will now trade around the world . 24 / 7 Huh ? Oh yes . ( Door beeps as light changes to green ) ( Warning beeps ) Excuse me , Yes , Allan . Given the prices we charge to students , schools . What sort of improvements have been made in Flynn I mean , uh , ENCOM O.S. twelve ? This year we put a twelve on the box . Edward : O.S. 12 is the most secure operating system ever released . The idea of sharing our software or giving it away for free . Disappeared with , Kevin Flynn . ( High pitched beep as door opens ) Guard : We know you 're here . Let 's make this easy . Come on , come on . FREEZE ! Richard : Okay , if there are no more questions . I would like you to meet , our next blockbuster . ENCOM O.S. Twelve . ( Dog barks ) Whoa ! Richard : Just a few ... bugs . Bear with us , one second . ( Dog continues to bark on screen ) Stop ! Stop , stop . Stop , stop , will you just stop . For one second . Nikkei will be open in thirty seconds . Does anyone know where the master file is ? Alan : I do . It 's on the web . Richard : This is mad , gotta stop this . We 've got to ring that opening bell . Richard : How is this happening , we 've got to stop this now . No , let 's just , shut it down . - Shut it down , NOW ! - Relax . Relax , it 's under control . Richard : Relax ? Our most valuable and most secure operating system is out there for free . How am I suppose to explain that ? I don 't ' know . Say it was all part of the plan . A little uh , a little gift from ENCOM . Reporter : Apparently ENCOM technologies is having some ... - technical difficulties . - No . Hey , Dad . What are you doing ? Guard : Where are you going to run to now ? Now you don 't want to do that . Guard : Didn 't anyone tell you , stealing is wrong . Sam : Can 't steal something that was designed to be free . Now I got you . Don 't sweat it , your boss is okay with it . - The hell he is . - Sam : Your boss works for the CEO . The CEO works for the shareholders . Now do you know who the biggest shareholder is ? I don 't know , some kid . You 're Mr. Flynn . Why ? This is your father 's company . Not anymore . Wha ... , hey , hey kid . No , NOOOOOOO ! Woo , hoo , hoo , hooo . Yeah ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . ( Slam 's to a stop ) O ... kay . Guards : Hey , there he is , get him . HEY ! No free rides . Sam : Whoa ! Taxi Driver : No free Taxi , you pay . ( Laughs ) ( Approaching police car sirens ) ( Cabs brakes screech ) Police man : Hold it right there , freeze ! ( Helicopter flaps from above ) Okay boys , you got me . Hey . ( Door rumbles as it closes ) Sam : Enjoy it Marv , you earned it . Why are you in my apartment , Allen ? You don 't answer your phone . How you been , Sam ? Oh , you know , when I was twelve , I really appreciated the surrogate father thing . But come on , Allen . I got it all under control . ( Train horn walls in background ) Oh , clearly . What is it ? You want to help me with my home work ? Like old times , have a catch . Well you got a , pretty nice view here . Heard you did a triple axel off a roof a few hours ago ? Alan : Rough landing , huh ? Hmm , could have been worse . Alan : I also thought your message to the board was very clever . Sam : Oh , you like that ? Well , that was Marv 's idea . Allan , we really gonna do this again ? Do I really look like I 'm ready to run a fortune 500 company ? No . But truthfully , the companies pretty happy with where you are . See that way they can just keep doing whatever they want . Well I guess what I find curious is the crazy charities , the annual prank on the company . Sure have an interesting way of being disinterested , Sam . Why are you here , Alan ? I was paged last night . Oh man , still rocking the pager , hey ? Good for you . Yeah , your Dad once told me I had to sleep with it , I still do . Page came from your Dad 's office , at the arcade . So . So , that numbers been disconnected for twenty years . Sam , two nights before he disappeared , he came to my house . I 've cracked it , he kept saying . He was talking about genetic algorithms , Quantum teleportation . He said he was about to change everything . Uh , science , medicine , religion . He wouldn 't have left that , Sam . He wouldn 't have left you . Al , you 're the only one who still believes that . He 's either dead , or chillin ' in Costa Rica . Probably both . I 'm sorry . I 'm tired . I smell like jail . Let 's just reconvene in another couple of years , huh ? What do you say ? Here . These are the keys to the arcade . I haven 't gone over there , yet . I thought you should be the one . Alan , your acting like I 'm going to find him sitting there working . Just , " Hey kiddo , lost track of time " . Wouldn 't that be something . What ? ( Whines ) ( Barks ) ( Motorcycle roars down street ) ( Door creaks open ) ( Clicks , and sound of machines starting ) ( Journey 's " Separate Way 's " plays ) * Here we stand * * Worlds apart , hearts broken in two , two , two * * Sleepless nights * * Losing ground , I 'm reaching for you , * - ( Arcade machine walls ) - * you , you . * * Feelin ' that it 's gone * * Can change your mind * * If we can 't go on * * To survive the tide , love divides * * Someday love will find you * * Break those chains that bind you . * * One night will remind you * ( Sound of click and whirls ) * How we touched And went our separate ways * * If he ever hurts you * ( Flash light clicks ) ( Door creaks loudly ) ( Music sounds distant ) ( Door slams shut ) ( Arcade machine beeps ) ( Muffled sound of song in background ) ( Door knob clicks ) ( Beat of drums in song heard ) Sam : You son of a gun . ( Clicks flashlight off ) ( Computer clicks as he hits buttons on screen ) Huh . Sam : See you got a backdoor . ( Computer beeps warning ) ( Whining sound from machine ) ( Drum beats silent ) ( Door slammed open ) ( Lightening cracks above ) Sam : This isn 't happening . Oh man , this IS happening . Black Guard 1 : This program has no disk . Black Guard 1 : Another stray . Sam : Wait , I 'm not a program . He actually did it . Sam : I 'm on the grid . Does the name Kevin Flynn mean anything to you ? Be quiet if you want to live . Programs madly chants : Game , games , the games . Not the games . What 's his problem ? ( Half-face growls ) Rectify . Rectify . - Games . - NO ! - Please . - Rectify . Look I know you probably get this a lot , But there 's been a big mistake . Games . Please , no , no , no . Whoa , hey ! Crazed program shouts : Erase me ! AHHHHH ! ( ( ( ZAP ) ) ) No ! Can somebody tell me what the hell . Hey , hey ! That 's got a zipper . ( Shoes clop as they walk in same rhythm ) He is different . This can 't be good . Computer : Attention , program . You will receive an identity disc . Computer : Everything you do or learn , will be imprinted on this disc . Computer : If you lose your disc , or fail to follow commands . You will be subject to immediate , deresolution . ( Disc snaps in place ) Nearly complete . Disc activated and synchronized . Proceed to games . Sam : Games ? ( Female programs clop back ) Where you going ? What am I suppose to do ? Survive . * Techno music blasting * ( Sound of crowd cheering ) Female Computer : Combatants , prepare for Disc Wars . ( Crowd loudly cheers " Disc Wars " ) Computer : Platform eight . I have a strange version of you on my shelf . Computer : Combatants 3 and 11 . Computer : Disc wars . He definitely didn 't do that . ( Sound of glass shattering ) ( Crowd cheers ) Sam : Damn it . ( Glass shatters ) So that 's how it is . ( Disc whizzes in air ) ( Glass shattering ) Computer : Combatant 11 , deresolution . I won ! Now let me out . Computer : Combatant 3 , round one , victory . Jarvis : No unusual activity on the grid . Security sweeps and patrols have been intensified . Right to par , on schedule . Your initiate should be fully operational within twelve cycles . Perhaps if you were to include me , in this mission , I could be of even greater service . Computer : Combatant 's 3 , and 7 . Disc wars . Computer : Initiate ( Growls ) Yeah . I 'm out of this . ( Sound of glass shattering ) ( Panting ) Computer : Combatant 3 , victory . Computer : Combatant 3 , violation . Computer : Combatant 6 , deresolution . What is that program ? Computer : Combatant three . Computer : Violation . Computer : Initiate final round . Computer : Combatant 3 , versus Rinzler . ( Crowd chants , Rinzler ) You 've gotta be kidding me . ( Crowd continues to chant " Rinzler " ) Aw , come on , is that even legal ? Whoa ! ( Squeaks on floor ) Yeah ! ( Cheer from crowd ) Why do I feel like I just got dumped on . Come on , huh ? Come on . ( Slams into ceiling ) ( Sam moans ) ( Sam grunts in pain ) ( Loud cheer from crowd ) Rinzler : User . ( Crowd boo 's ) Man : Identify yourself , program . I 'm not a program . Cloaked man : Identify ... . ( Echoes ) My name is Sam Flynn . Cloaked man : Bring him to me . Sam : Let me go . Freaks . Where am I ? Sam : Am I on the grid ? Who are you ? Dad . Sam . Look at you , man . Look at the size of you . How did you get in here ? I got your message . Oh . So it 's just you ? Yeah . Just you . Wow , isn 't this something . Sam : You look the same . Oh , a lot has happened , Sam . More than you can imagine . This . Kevin : Let 's take a look . ( Sam laughs ) Got it . Hmm , I expected more . So , you were trapped in here . That 's right . You 're in charge . Right again . Two for two . So , can we just go home now . Not in the cards . Not for you . That 's a hell of a way to treat your son . Oh , that . I 'm not your father , Sam . But I 'm very , very happy to see you . CLU . Where is he ? Sam : What 'd you do to him ? CLU : Same thing I 'm going to do to you . CLU : User . ( Fireworks whistle and explode in air ) Greetings programs . Oh what a vocation we have here before us . Because , your rumors are true . We do indeed have in our midst , a user . ( Crowd boo 's ) Aaa uuuser . Jarvis : So , what to do ? What does this User deserve . Might I suggest perhaps , the challenge of the grid . ( Loud roar of cheers ) Jarvis : And who best to battle this senior opponent ? Jarvis : Perhaps one who has some experience in these matters . Jarvis : Oh yes , indeed programs . Jarvis : Your liberator , your luminary . ( Fireworks whistle and explode ) Jarvis : Your leader and beacon . Jarvis : The one who vanquished the tyranny of the user . Jarvis : Those many cycles before . CLU : I 've been waiting a long time for this . Jarvis : CCCCLLLLLLUUUUU . You wanna play ? I 'll play . Excellent word , sir . Were you pleased with my execution ? The crowd seemed quite energized . CLU : It wasn 't meant for them . What 's this ? What do I do with this ? I 'll give you a hint . Not that . Computer : Grid is live . Computer : Initiate light-cycle battle . ( Whirls and clicks and cycle appears ) ( Light-cycles zoom by ) You got no chance , User . Blue program : Their bots are faster than ours . Use the level 's . ( Cycles whiz away ) Now this I can do . ( Clicks and whirls ) Sam : Here we go . ( Light-cycle rider screams ) ( Cycle hums faster ) ( Revs Light-cycle ) Sam : Whoa . Hoh , oh ! AAAAAH ! ( Sound of shattering glass ) Sam : Hey . We gotta work together . It 's the only way . That 's it , you got me . Boo ! Whoo , hoo hoo , keep out . Now that 's what I 'm talking about . Sam : Another customer . Let 's go . ( Cycle clicks back to baton ) Hang on buddy , I 'm coming . Come on . ( Laughter ) This is it . Come on . ( Crowd cheers ) ( Sound of vehicle approaching ) NO ! ( Cycle explodes ) ( Crowd boos ) Computer : Illegal combatant on the grid . Driver : Get in . Computer : Illegal combatant on the grid . Computer : GET IN ! ( Rev 's car 's motor ) Computer : System failure , release Rinzler . Game on old friend . Who are you ? Hang on . ( Cycle drivers scream ) Oh man , you can 't make that . Driver : Made it . I 'm , Quorra . They 're turning around . Not by choice . Quorra : Their vehicles aren 't designed to go off grid . Quorra : They 'll mal-function on this terrian . Sam : What about us ? Hah , obviously not . Where are you taking me ? Patience , Sam Flynn . All your questions will be answered soon . Sam : Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! ( Quorra laughs ) ( Sound of distant thunder ) Wait here . Man : Quorra . Man : I dreamed of Tron . Man : First time in years . Quorra : It 's a sign . Man : A sign my dear friend , is of a weary soul . Man : I 'm afraid something 's happened . Quorra : Something has happened . We have a guest . Man : There are no guests here . Sam . Sam : Long time . You have no idea . You 're , you 're here . You 're here . I 'm here . You 're big . You 're . Old . Kevin : How did you get here ? Alan came over . Really . He got your page . I found your office under the arcade . Page ? Oh , man , of course . CLU had him on the Light-Cycle grid . I intervened . Oh . Been there soon , CLU taught them . He never thought he 'd see you again . Yeah . Vintage . Flynn built it many cycles ago for the games . It doesn 't get out as much as it used to , but . Still the fastest thing on the grid . ( Thunder rumbles ) Quorra : Do you know it ? His patience usually beats out my more , aggressive strategy . Flynn shared them with me . I 've read them all . Wow , you like reading . Tolstoy , Dostoyevsky , Lee Chang , Journey without a goal . Must have a killer ending . Flynn is teaching me about the art of the selfless . About , removing oneself from the equation . But , between you and me . Jules Verne is my favorite . Do you know , Jules Verne ? Sure . What 's he like ? ( Lightening cracks in skies ) Your move Flynn , come on . Come on . ( Taps spoon on plate ) How old are you now , Sam ? - Uh , - You should be 27 . I just turned 27 . Do you attend a college ? Cal-Tech . Cal-Tech . My Alma-Mater . Sam : Yeah . That 's why I dropped out . ( Laughs ) Work ? - A job ? ENCOM or you , uh ... - No . I check in once a year . - Life , girlfriend ? - A dog . I have one . A rescue . Well , dogs uh , dogs are cool . I 'm sure you must have a few questions of your own , Sam . Actually , just one . Why I never came home ? Those nights when I went to the office I 'm sure you figured it out by now , was to come here . Moving forward into digital space . Maybe , still . But , I also had you . I had ENCOM , I couldn 't be in your world all the time . I needed partners . To help out . - Tron and CLU . - That 's right . Kevin Narrates : Tron was created by Alan for the old system . I brought him here to protect this one . CLU was my creation . A program designed to create a perfect world . Kevin : We were jammin ' man , building utopia . Hours in here were just minutes back home . Just when I thought it couldn 't get anymore profound . Something unexpected happened . The Miracle . The Miracle . You remember . Iso 's Isomorphic Algrarithm 's . A whole new life form . And you created them ? ( Laughs ) No , no . They manifested . Like a flame . They weren 't really , really from anywhere . The conditions were right , and they came into being . Kevin : For centuries we dreamed of gods , spirits , aliens . Kevin : An intelligence beyond our own . You seeing this ? Kevin : I found them , in here . Like flowers in the waste land . Profoundly naive . Unimaginably wild . They were spectacular . Everything I 'd hope to find in the system . Control , order , perfection . None of it meant a thing . But living in a hall of mirrors . The Iso 's . Shattered . The possibilities of their root code , their digital DNA . Disease ? History ! Science , philosophy , every idea , man has ever had about the universe up for grabs . Bio digital jazz , man . Kevin : The Iso 's , they were going to be my gift to the world . Sam : So , what happened ? Kevin : CLU . CLU happened . Kevin : Will you stop worrying about everything , Tron . Kevin : Everything is fine , everything 's under control . CLU : Flynn ! Am I still to create the perfect system ? Yeah . Kevin : It was a coup . Go ! You 've been corrupted . ( Disc 's whirl ) Wait ... . wait ! Flynn , go ! Yahhh ! Kevin : Tron , he fought for me . I never saw him again . So why don 't you fight ? He did . Kevin : He fed on my resistance . The more I fought , the more powerful it became . It was impressed with him . Kevin : And my miracle ? CLU saw the ISO 's as an imperfection . So he destroyed them . The purge . He killed them all ? It was genocide . I tried to get back . But I couldn 't get to the portal . It uses massive power . And it can 't stay open forever . And like a safe . It can only be opened from the outside . It closed on me , Sam . That 's why I never came home . Sam : So the portal . It activated when I came in . Sam : So it 's open , now . Kevin : Not for long . Kevin : Only one millicycle , about eight hours . So , we go now . Go home . Make a run for it . - Get you out of here . - Kevin : Don 't rush . What do you mean , don 't rush . The portal 's going to close . What ? What is it ? Quorra : The moment Flynn is on the grid , CLU will stop at nothing to obtain his disc . My disc is everything , Sam . It 's the master key . The golden ticket , the way out . But not just for me . - What do you mean ? - Our worlds are more connected than anyone knows . CLU figures if I can be in . He can be out ? With my disc , it 's possible . And then what ? Game over . The guy doesn 't dig imperfection . What 's more important than our world ? I can 't let that happen . I won 't . So what 'll we do ? Nothing ? It 's amazing how productive doing nothing can be . CLU 's planning something . We 've known that for a while . Kevin : Programs have been disappearing , there 's unrest out there . Kevin : Even revolution . If we sit tight , he might be brought down from the inside . Sam : The portal 's closing . We can 't just sit around . We have to move now . Kevin : Tell me . What brought you here ? Through the grid . Alan got your page . I didn 't send any page . It was CLU . CLU sent that page . That 's why you 're here . Kevin : This is all his design . He wanted a new piece on the board to change the game . With you he got more than he ever dreamed . This is precisely what he wants . Us together , heading for the portal . It 's his game now . The only way to win is not to play . Now that 's a hell of a way to win . But it is a way . We can go you home . Don 't you want that ? Sometimes life has a way of moving you past things like wants and hopes . That 's right , Dad . Keep telling yourself that . Goodnight , Sam . How can he be so afraid of his own creation ? I mean , he built CLU . Why doesn 't he just end him . He could but it would require reintegration . Yeah , all right . Flynn would never survive the effect . It would mean the end of them both . If he refuses to save himself , then I will . How ? I 'm going to the portal . CLU wants Flynn 's disc , not mine . I 'm going to find Allen and we 're going to figure this thing out from the other side . This may be CLU 's game here , But in my world he 's gone in one keystroke . But I can 't do anything unless I get to the portal . My guts tell me that you don 't want to be stuck in this place for eternity . I really think you should consider your father 's wisdom . I have . ( Stomps away ) ( Knock on door ) There 's someone I once knew . A program named Zuse , who fought along side the ISO 's . They say he can get anyone , anywhere . How do I find him ? This is his sector . Make it there alive . And he 'll find you . Sam . ( Knock on door ) Sam ? ( Motorcycle hums ) Sam : Hey man , it 's your lucky day . Guard : Stop it . Woman : Sam Flynn . - Woman : You remember me . - Yeah . You gave me some advice . And you followed it . Its unfortunate we met the way we did . You have a good night . You 're looking for someone . What makes you say that . Intuition . Sir , sentries downtown , recovered Flynn 's light cycle . They 've traced it to it 's component of origin . ( Elevator whirls as it rises ) Kevin : Prepare the light-runner Quorra . Kevin : We 're going downtown . Thank you for bringing my son to me . Flynn , you don 't need to go . I sent him to someone we can trust . Quorra , there is no choice . I won 't lose him again . Chaos , good news . Relax , they 're occupied . His name is Castor . You want to speak to Zuse you 're going to have to go through him . Castor : Where is your sense of humor , my friend ? Barkik : Programs are disappearing , Castor . Soon none of us will be left . Barkik : Zuse can unite the factions , ferment revolution . Well of course Zuse can do these things . Grant me an audience . Your enthusiasm is intoxicating my dear bot , But Zuse 's time is precious . We shall see . Whispers : I bought your boy , Flynn . If you 'll excuse me a moment , I have to , uh ... Attend to something , but have a drink . Courtesy of the " End of line " club . It is happening . Castor : Come , away from these primitive functions . The son of Flynn . Of all the innumerable possibilities . He has to walk into mine . Libations , for everybody ! I 'm Castor . Your host . Provider of any and all entertainment and diversions . At your service . ( Plants cane on floor ) I 'm looking for Zuse . Indeed . Many are . Where can I find him ? This pretty miss , is a conversation best had behind closed doors . Perhaps we should retire to my private lounge . ( Taps cane on floor ) Uh , designed it myself , you know . It 's true . I 'm stepping away for a moment , boys . Change the scheme , alter the mood . Electrify the boys and girls , if you 'd be so kind . Thank you . Gem . My name is , Gem . ( Beat of music speeds up ) ( Rinzler growls ) Cozy . ( Crashing sound behind ) ( Vase clatters on floor ) - You are CLU . - I am CLU . You will create the perfect system . I will create the perfect system . Together we 're going to change the world , man . ( Angrily screams ) ( Strained laughter ) Let 's move . Castor : Zuse has been around since the earliest days of the gaming grid . By necessity . He has to mine all the percentages . All the angles . So when do I meet him ? You ... just ... did . Zuse : After the purge , I needed to reinvent myself . Self preservation , you understand . ( Glasses ring ) Now . What can I do , for you ? I need to get to the portal . Well , it 's closing quickly . As I 'm sure , you 're aware . Tick-tock , tick-tock . And it 's quite the journey . Beyond the far reaches of the outlands . Zuse : Your father didn 't want any programs , slipping out accidentally , did he . Can you help me ? Of course . But first , as a man who prides himself on staying well informed . I must ask , who sent you my way ? Her name 's , Quorra . Said she met you a long time ago . Indeed she did . Many cycles ago . Zuse : It was a different time . But we 're not here to relive the past . Let 's see about your future , shall we ? Now , we 'll have to , uh ... change your attire , and you 'll need a forged disc . Not easy these days , by the way . And of course you 'll need transport . To cross the sea of simulation . This is going to be quite a ride . ( Sound of glass shattering ) ( Women screaming ) I believed in users once before . Playing all the angles . Revenge ! ( Shattering ) Zuse : The game has changed . Son of Flynn ! ( Disc crackles ) Ha , ha , haaa . Met your friend . He 's fantastic . ( Madly screams ) Behold , the son of our maker . Yeah , yeah . ( Groans in pain ) Yeah , yeah . Let 's split , man . ( Explosion ) Whoa , whoa , whoa . ( Shot , explosion ) Sam : A little help here , maybe . ( Elevator screeches to stop ) Sam : Your Disc . Dad , it 's gone . It is . I 'm sorry , I know I messed up . Sam : We can go back , I can go back . No , we stay together . Dad , I can do this . You 've done enough all ready . Sam , your really-- - You 're messin ' with my Zen thing , man . Kevin : She 's stable . Sam : So what do we do now ? I don 't know . Nothing . We do nothing . We still , Kevin : ... wait . You ever jump a freight train ? Huh ? We do it your way . It 's a long sprint to the portal . If we beat CLU there we have a chance . Let 's get her out of here . This will take us there . Is she going to make it ? I don 't know , I gotta identify the damaged code . The sequence on it is just enormously complex . Sam : But didn 't you write it ? Kevin : ( Laughs ) Some of it , the rest of it is just , beyond me . She 's an Iso . Kevin : Yeah , the last Iso . All this time you were just , protecting her . She 's the miracle , man . Everything I ever worked for . A digital frontier to reshape the human condition . Sam : I always thought that was just a plot line . Kevin : In our world , she could change everything . Check that out . She risked herself for me . Some things are worth the risk . Kevin : Look at this . Kevin : Now that is impressive , if I do say so myself , huh ? Come on , it 's going to take a while for her system to reboot . Now it 's time for you to tell me a story . CLU : The boy and Flynn are gone . Zuse : I presume your Excellency , they perished in the elevator . You presume . Find them . Sam : Ice caps are melting , Sam : War in the middle east . Sam : Lakers , Celtics , Batman . I don 't know rich are getting richer . The poor are getting poorer . Cell phones , online dating , Wi-Fi . What 's Wi-Fi ? - Wireless sim-linking - Of Digital devices ? - Yeah . - Oh . I thought of that when you were five . Mom and Dad , - I assume let go - Yeah . Oh . Back when I was twelve . Gram five years later . You remember that night . When you didn 't come home . - Well , you said , - I said I 'd show you the grid . You should have seen this place back then . Couldn 't wait to show it to you . The net-way . Must have been something , before CLU screwed it up . No , no , he , he 's me . I screwed it up . Crazy after perfection . Chasing after what was right in front of me . Right in front of me . Look what you 've accomplished . It 's incredible . Sam . I 'd give it all up for one more day with you . Hey . Remember your old Ducati ? You kidding me . There 's not a day goes by I don 't think about that bike . Yeah , well . Fixing her up . What are you busting my bike ? Well twenty years in the shed , no tork , I mean . She knew you were her love . How 's she running ? Well , when I 'm done . Better than ever . Aw man , I 'd like to see that . You will . Here , she 's rebooting , give her this . Your old man is going to knock on the sky , listen for the sound . When Flynn entered the space , ahh , everything changed . Zuse : I 've never seen anything quite like it . The aura was palpable . Was it . I presume our understanding , is still valid . Control of the city . A sizable request . I know . But , uh ... Seemingly fitting compensation . Don 't you think ? How long have you been searching for this ? Hmm ? A thousand cycles ... huh ? Just imagine the secrets it holds . The master key to any and all , riddles of the grid , grid , grid . There 's something else , too . Zuse : Isn 't there ? Zuse : I 've heard the chatter . About this private initiative . Zuse : I realize that our alliance is at times , uneasy . But always necessary . You know you need me . Right where I am . CLU . Of course , you 're right . You have the drink . ( Device quickly beeps ) CLU : End of line , man . - ( Gasps for breath ) - Hey , hey . It 's okay , we 're safe for now . We 're heading east , towards the portal . CLU has the disc . Once I get out , I can shut him down . I should never have sent you to Zuse . It was a mistake . It 's okay , I made a few myself . Where is he ? Sam : I think he 's knocking on the sky . Quorra : And listening to the sound . Yeah . How did you find him ? It 's okay . I know . Quorra : It was during the purge . CLU was relentless . The Black guard were executing Iso 's in the streets . Everyone I knew , disappeared . Then they came for me . So I ran . Quorra : As sympathetic programs smuggled me out of the city . but soon they had me surrounded . I prepared for the end . And just as everything was going dark . I felt a hand . On my shoulder . And when I opened my eyes . Quorra : Standing above me , was the creator . Your father . He saved me . I guess you could say I 'm , a rescue . Sam : Hell of a view . Quorra : It used to let us know that Flynn was here . Quorra : It became a symbol of something bigger . Quorra : Something , better in this world . I 've never been this close before . It 's how I imagined a sunrise to be . Ah , trust me . There 's no comparison . What 's it like ? - The sun ? - Yeah . Oh , man . I 've never had to describe it before . Warm . Radiant . Beautiful . ( Rumble of ship ) Kevin screams : Get below . MOVE ! This isn 't suppose to be here . What happened ? A new course . What is this ? CLU can 't create programs . Kevin : He can only destroy and repurpose them . Repurpose them for what ? Sam : He 's building an army . Let 's go . - Goodbye . - Quorra ! Quorra . What 's she doing ? Removing herself from the equation . Tron . Kevin : He 's alive . We can 't just let her go . Sam ! There 's another way . Barkik : Well done sir . CLU : Have you ever seen anything like it ? Barkik : Humbly , sir . Barkik : I know you have greater designs , then any of us understand . What does it do ? ( Sound of marching feet ) She 's going to wind up like one of them . Keep moving , Sam . ( Programs chanting , CLU , CLU ) You are a very rare bird , aren 't you . Where 's your disc ? Where is he ? Must have been so lonely out there . Tragic to be the only one . I 've seen what users are capable of , CLU . You don 't belong with them . I have something very special in mind for you . Take her upstairs . And find them . You 'll have to excuse me . You arrived just as I was prepared for the toast . CLU begins his speech : Greetings programs . Together we have achieved a great many things . We have created a vast complex system . We 've maintained it , we 've improved it . We have rid it of its imperfection . Not to mention , ridding of the false deity who sought to enslave us . Kevin Flynn ! Where are you now ? My fellow programs , let there be no doubt . That our world is a cage no more . For at this moment . The key to the next frontier is finally in our possession . The disc . CLU : And unlike our selfish creator who preserved the privilege of our world only to himself . I will make their world open , and available to all of us . YES ! To all of us . ( Soldiers cheer ) Sam : He 's taking all of us with him . He 's figured out how to do it . CLU : And whatever we find there . There our system will grow , there our system will blossom . Do this , prove yourselves , prove yourself to me . Be loyal to me . And I will never betray you . Dad , we have to get your disc . No we gotta get to the portal . You shut them down from the outside . Even if I make it out you won 't last in here . - Quorra won 't last .. - I said it will be all right , come on . Will you let it go , I 'm not going home without you . Sam . Same team . Remember ? I was afraid you were going to say that . Meet me on the flight deck in five . And get us some wheels . Wheels ? What 's your plan ? I 'm a user . I 'll improvise . CLU : Rid the new system of its imperfections . My vision is clear . Out there , is a new world ! Out there is our victory . Out there , is our destiny . ( Door dings as it opens ) ( Black guard roars ) Black Guard : Identify yourself , program . I 'm not a program . My name is Sam Flynn . ( Sound of breaking glass ) ( Sound of fighting ) ( Beeping with touch ) Identify yourself . I 'm taking this vehicle . You are not authorized . Right away , sir . Watch your step please , as you board the aircraft . ( Scream and shatter ) Down with the users . Computer : Master key , disengaged . Computer : Master key , disengaged . I came with a girl . A program , where is she ? ( Door dings ) Sam . GO ! ( Disc whirls ) AAAAH ! What are you doing here ? We gotta get to the flight deck . But CLU will be here any minute . We 'll never make it . Come on . Come on , kiddo . Radical , man . ( Sam grunts with landing ) Hurry ! Made it . Try to hold on to this . You 're gonna need it . You got this , Quorra . It 's all in the wrist . ( Engine whines grow faster ) Death to the user . ( Glass breaks and shatters ) ( Clicks and whirls as Light-jets form ) Head towards the light , Quorra . Where did you learn that move back there ? ENCOM tower . Couple nights ago . ENCOM tower . Huh . Light-jets . Here they come . - Sam , take the turret . - Huh ? Oh man , I 'm all over this . ( Sound of rapid machine gun fire ) Yeaah ! Sam : Yeah , ha , ha , ha . One down , five to go . Nice . We gotta split them up . ( Flyer screams ) Come on . ( Explosion as jet hits water ) Have a nice swim . Sam : You gotta get behind them . Waoooo ! I don 't think this is a good idea . You 're probably right . He 's gaining on us . ( Jets engine sputters and dies ) ( Laughs ) ( Sam continues rapid firing ) YES ! It 's jammed . Tron . What have you become ? Aw , come on . ( Tron 's past cry echoes in mind ) Flynn , go ! CLU : Rinzler , take a shot . CLU : Finish the game . Noooooooo ! ( Engine explodes ) Tron : I , fight for the users ! CLU : Aaaaaaah ! That was him . It 's over . It 's over ! ( Quorra laughs with joy ) Quorra : Waoooo ! Quorra , there 's something I need you to do . Let 's get you home , Dad . ( Engines whine grows slower ) There it is . Take her down . Hang on . This could be rough . This is mine . Kevin : Had a feeling you 'd be here . The cycle 's haven 't been kind , have they . Well , you don 't look so bad . I did everything . Everything you ever asked . I know you did . CLU : I executed the plan . As you saw it . You , you promised that we would change the world , together . You broke your promise . I know , I understand that now . I took this system to its maximum potential . I created the perfect system . The thing about perfection , is that it 's unknowable . It 's impossible , but it 's also right in front of us all the time . You wouldn 't know that because I didn 't when I created you . I 'm sorry , CLU . I 'm sorry . ( Grunts ) ( Sam screams ) Go . CLU ! Remember what you came for . DAD ! CLU : You knew I 'd beat you . And still you did all this . For him . No . No . Why ? He 's my son . Gooooo ! Dad ! Sam , it 's time . No ! Sam . It 's what he wants . I 'm not leaving you . Take her . Yes . Goodbye , kiddo . ( Electronic pulse ) ( SCREAMS WITH RAGE ) ( Explosion ) ( Explosion contracts ) ( Small beeps ) ( Clicks off ) Sam : Alan . You paged me ? Yeah . You jet ENCOM at 8AM . What about the board ? We trim them out . I 'm taking the company back , Alan . Oh , and you were right . About what ? About everything . ( Clicks sign on ) Quorra : What 's next , Sam ? I guess we 're suppose to change the world . Come on , I want to show you something . Tip for download : Open Subtitles MKV Player

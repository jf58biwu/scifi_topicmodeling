 89 degrees , 15 minutes and 50.8 seconds . That 's the current position of Polaris . The Northern Star . Viewed from another planet , it 's just one among many . But on Earth , it 's uniquely important . Fixed in place , an anchor . No matter where you are in the northern hemisphere , if you face Polaris , you face north . You know where you are . But there are other ways to get lost . In the choices we make . In events that overwhelm us . Even within our own minds . What can be an anchor then ? What beacon can we turn to to guide us from darkness to light ? What if it 's other people ? The lives that touch our own , in ways big and small ? Because unlike Polaris ... the light that they bring ... will never fade . Hey , buddy . I 'm sorry . I had to work an extra shift dropping off bags last night . Yep . It was as fun as it sounds . I had the dream again . I love you , Jake . All right . Jake Bohm . Where are we ? I will admit , on paper , there 's reason for concern . I 'll say . Father 's overwhelmed , child 's unresponsive . However , from where I stand I see positive signs . You always do . You make it sound like a bad thing . We 're a week away from the final eval with no tangible progress . Nothing we can put before the board and say , " this situation 's stabilized . " Now I know a lot can change in a week , but I think we should have options prepared . Options ? For where Jake might be institutionalized . Sheri , please , if I could just ... I 'm so sorry . This is Clea Hopkins . Ms. Hopkins , I 'm calling from Victory Memorial , at the psych ward . Your mother is here . Did you bring what I asked ? Yes . Yeah . I wrote down every number that Jake has given me since March 18 . The anomalies . What is this about ? Read them . Three-18 , five-two-nine ... Six ... three , two , eight , seven nine , five , two , two . How could you possibly know that ? The numbers your son gives you , Mr. Bohm , aren 't new . They 've always existed . He found the Amelia Sequence . Those numbers changed everything for me . The first time it happened ... ten years ago . My vision swam , I ... I-I couldn 't feel my limbs . It 's as if I wasn 't a body anymore . I was just , I was just one with everything . And that 's the first time you saw these numbers ? The road map . The sequence that connects everything , everyone ... I just for a moment , I had a grasp of it . They told me it was an aneurysm , I 'd lost brain function . I hadn 't lost anything . I found my purpose . But I couldn 't hold onto it . Your sequence has three more digits that Jake 's . Nine-seven-five . The next anomaly . What does that mean ? That 's why I called you here . Those are the last numbers to my vision . I think we 're on the threshold of something . It is a critical stage . I need to see Jake today . I mean ... for real . Now . Right now Jake 's under a microscope . If I 'm not careful , I 'm gonna lose custody . Please . I 'm sorry . I can 't . Look , when Jake comes back home things will be different , but ... until then I can 't risk rocking the boat . Look ... I 'm late for work . Thank you . Thank you . Okay , sounds good . Pull the files , we 'll talk when I land . Oh , wait . I do need your help . Clue is ... first name in rags , five letters . No , no , no , no , don 't look it up . Yep . I got this . Eubie . I 'm sorry . The answer ... it 's Eubie . James Hubert Blake . Jazz and ragtime legend . Sometimes I wonder who they make these for . An eight letter word for feet ? Trilbies . That 's not a word . Either you 're a genius or I have to go back to school . Or I 'm just a know-it-all who can 't help himself . I 'm sorry . Enjoy your puzzle . Lanny Zheng . Will Davies . Nice to meet you . Yeah , you , too . Drop off from JFK , your lost bag . Sorry for the inconvenience . If you could just sign right there . Thank you . You got kids ? Yeah , a son . Mr. McNichols ? Do you have any idea what your son was wearing when he went missing ? Any recent photos ? I 'm sorry to pull you away from work , but we can only hold her for 24 hours , and it took us a while to hunt down your name . Do you know why she was arrested ? Shoplifting , but she was obviously confused , so they brought her here for evaluation . When 's the last time you saw your mother ? It 's been six years . She 's schizophrenic . Lives on the street . The good news is we have a bed available . If she 'll consent . Hi . I know what you want . I 'm not staying here . Nothing changes , right ? The other day I got a call from the hospital . They told me you 'd been hit by a car . You might not wake up . It was a mistake , obviously . But the sad part ? Part of me felt relieved . It 's not right , Mom . I don 't want that to be our story . Stay here . Let them help you . I 'm asking as your daughter . Daughter ? I don 't know you . Mom ... it 's me , Clea . I 'm your daughter . No , you not . My baby at home . Your baby ? Mom , what are we talking about ? Let me go ! Good morning . Dr. Arthur Teller . Here for a consult . Hello , Jake . My name is Arthur Teller . I guess you 've been expecting me . Thanks again for coming down . I wish things had turned out differently . The policeman that brought my mother here , did he say what she tried to steal ? I think he said it was children 's medicine . Cough syrup . My mother said she had to get home to her baby . A few years ago there was an incident . She was confused , and she tried to walk away from a playground with someone else 's child . If you want I can check AMBER Alerts . Delivery for Dr. Williams . Please sign here at the bottom . Mr. Bohm ? What are you doing here ? I 'm working . What are you doing here ? Is everything all right ? Yeah . It 's just been a weird morning . What can you tell us about Andy 's disappearance ? Um , Andy was wearing a red baseball cap . I just talked to that guy . Can you turn that up , please ? Andy has a cold . He 's been coughing , and ... Cough syrup . I turned around for one minute , and he was gone . What is it ? I think my mother might have taken that child . ... and a red baseball cap at the time of his disappearance . You 're flying stand-by , right ? Mm . I don 't think you 're gonna make it . There are worse fates . What do you mean ? I-I just closed this huge real estate deal here in Manhattan- - my first one- - and , uh ... buyers are flying me out for a back-slapping session . That 's a good thing , right ? Yeah . I 'm a huge jazz nut , and I knew about this building in Queens , hundred years old . All the greats used to go there . And I told my bosses about it , and now they 're gonna tear it down , put up some slick new high-rise . And I feel ... I 'm sorry , it 's just one of those days where ... you wonder what it all means . What-what my purpose is ? Do you ever wonder that ? Not before my morning coffee , no . If my parents were here , they 'd say it 's procreation . Carrying on the family name . I 've tried that , actually . You know , when I was a kid , I tested 150 IQ . - Wow . - Yeah . I guess I thought I would 've done something more significant by now . Something more ... meaningful . There 's still time , right ? Lanny Zheng ? I need you to come with us , ma 'am . Your luggage went missing - in our system . - Oh , you 're joking . I 'm boarding in two minutes . Will Davies , please come to the counter to claim your stand-by seat . Okay . I think I just got your seat . - I am so sorry . - Unbelievable . - I 'm gonna miss my meeting . - Hang on . For next time . Ma 'am . Ma 'am . Jake . There 's something I need to ask you . Do you remember a few days ago , you were very upset , screaming ? Well , I was there . I-I used to have a patient , Jake , a young girl . Her name was Amelia . I 've been looking for her for a very long time . Toy cars were her favorite . Is she here , Jake ? Is that what you 're trying to tell me ? It 's Arthur Teller . He 's here . Yes , I 'm sure . He 's got a visitor 's badge . He 's here . I 'll find him . Six . Thank you , Jake . Of course . 975 . Teller was right . I understand . All right , thank you . What 'd the police say ? I gave them my mother 's description and history . They said they 'd look into it . - That 's it ? - I told them she might have that boy- - they 're scouring the city ; they can 't jump at every tip . Look at this- - this is the missing boy 's case number- - 975 . I 've already seen that number today . And then later , I had to drop a suitcase off at that boy 's house- - I met his father . And now I randomly run into you ? Meaning what ? - We 'll have to find your mother ourselves because that 's the only way we 're gonna save that boy . Where do we start ? Serena . You 're not supposed to be home . I got pulled from my flight by mistake . What is going on here ? Uh , this is George . He 's a medium . Excuse me , can I get one of those city maps , please ? - ... who went missing 48 hours ago . - Thanks . Andy is of average height , with brown hair and hazel eyes . - Okay . - An actual map ? Surprised they still sell those . Yeah , well , I 'm kind of old-school like that . Okay , this is where Andy 's parents reported him missing , and this is where your mother was arrested . Wow , they 're only a few blocks apart . Here 's where you come in . I want you to mark down on the map any other places in this area that your mother would normally frequent . Ms. Hopkins , please , I 'm just trying to help you - find your mom and the boy . - That 's not it . Social services took me from my mother when I was eight years old . She 's been on the street my entire life . I know this is our old neighborhood , but that 's it . I don 't know anything else about her . Did you have any contact with her ? Now and then . She 'd get picked up or arrested . I 'd try to get her into a hospital . She 'd always refuse . Then ... she 'd just ... disappear again ... until the next phone call . I 'm sorry . But we 're looking for a needle in a haystack , so anything that you can remember , no matter how small , is gonna help us get closer . So please , just-just try . Queensboro Plaza . What about it ? The other day , a homeless woman got hit by a taxi there- - she was carrying my mom 's cell phone . Oh , my God , I saw that accident happen . She ran right into me . Still think that there 's nothing to this ? ... the Hudson Valley outside of Yonkers , where a Pan American flight out of JFK has crashed . Emergency responders now on the scene , and they have reported , as you can see , the damage is near catastrophic . Authorities have given us no indication as to the cause of the crash . We will continue to provide updates as events unfold . Davies . What are you doing here ? Aren 't you supposed to be in Omaha ? I never got there . Everything all right ? I think if I told you , you wouldn 't believe me . Hey , I 'm glad you 're enjoying yourself . You deserve it . Because that right there , deal of the year , my friend . Just think , couple of hours , kaboom . Keep up the good work , all right , chief ? Mm . I can 't believe I have to ask this , but ... why do you have a medium in our home while I 'm away on work ? The lab called . None of my embryos were viable . Oh ... I 'm sorry . There has to be a reason . The doctors warned us , your follicle count is ... George said one of our dead ancestors is upset with us . That 's why I can 't get pregnant . _ _ _ _ That 's why I brought him here- - if the spirits have a message , - I want to hear it . - Baby , that is not a good idea . - Why not ? - Because you 're very upset . And this is all due respect , nonsense . Nonsense ? It wasn 't nonsense when you got that promotion at work . I got that promotion because I deserved it , not because you offered peanuts and wine to your dead great-grandfather . I seem to remember you asking me to do it . I was trying to be nice . George . _ Amelia . Hey , Amelia . Arthur ! Any luck ? - Any sign of your mother ? - No . It doesn 't make sense . We must have been led here for a reason . Is there anything about this place that you 're not telling me ? - It doesn 't matter . - What is it ? It doesn 't matter . Hey , we 're looking for a missing child . How on earth can you tell me it doesn 't matter ? You really want to know ? I told you before , the smallest thing might get us closer . This is where I would wait while my mom went up to the tracks and screamed at the top of her lungs while the train passed . Because it was the only way to silence the voices in her head . Meanwhile , I 'd hide down here , scared out of my mind , not knowing if she would come back down or not . Does that help you to know that ? Does that get us closer ? I 'm sorry . There 's nothing here . Let 's move on . Damn it . There 's got to be something . What is it ? Did you find her ? We checked every hallway . There 's no sign of any girl . Please , you got to believe me . I ... You told me your interest in this facility was about a patient . That was a lie , wasn 't it ? You 're still chasing ghosts . I know what I saw . There was a girl in that room . Her name is Amelia . If you don 't believe me , just check your-your ... You 're a part of this . What did they promise you , money , fame ? They promised me those things , too . If I see you near here again , I will call the police . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ What ? ! _ _ _ Serena , you can 't believe that . He is making it up . Is it true ? Do you not want a baby with me ? I have done everything I can to have a baby . I have paid for the treatments , the special diets , the premium donor list . I 'm not asking what you paid for . I 'm asking what you want . Honey , you know that I love you . I ... Hey . _ I remember this . My mom drew it here when I was a kid . Why ? In case something happened to her , or I got lost . " Twinkle , twinkle , little star . " Something about a bar . What ... what bar ? Look , there 's a bar on the next corner . It 's directions , so I would know how to get home . All right , so where now ? I think I remember " west " or " crest " ... Crest . Something about a crest . Oh , my God . Hey . All right , what have you got ? Hit me . Ever think what we do here is wrong ? Wrong ? Come on . We find the poorest neighborhoods , we drive down the prices , and then we just pave it all over . I mean , we ... we never stop to think about the places themselves . This building- man , it 's important . - You are right about that . That building is going to make this office $ 14 million in profit . Wrong answer . Back in the twenties , all the great jazz legends , man- - they-they used to stay there . Billie Holiday , Illinois Jacquet . Count Basie and his orchestra used to rehearse in the basement , man . We shouldn 't be tearing it down . We should be turning it into a museum . A museum ? Is this a joke ? Look , I know I made this deal happen , okay ? But the whole time , I knew I was helping to destroy something that should be preserved , cherished . But I told myself it didn 't matter , but it does . I 'm not gonna let you tear it down . Okay , okay . Slow down here a little bit . You 've done some good work around here . I mean , you 've got your whole career , you 've got your whole life for these ... No , I don 't . No , I don 't . No one does . That 's the point . I need to do something that matters . And it has to be today . There 's the crest on the side of the building . She 's got to be in there . Come on ! Hurry it up , fellas . We are on a schedule here . Please . I need to speak to whoever 's in charge . I know this is gonna sound crazy , but I need to get into that building . In ten minutes , there ain 't gonna be a building . Please . You don 't understand . I think my mother might be inside there . We used to stay here when I was a kid . There might be a child with her , too . Impossible . There 's no one left inside . We cleared out the last of them yesterday . Look , if this place is still standing in ten minutes , it 's my ass . Clear the area ! We 're going hot ! Hey . Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? ! You want to blow this place , you 'll have to kill me , too . Come on , now ! It 's not that I don 't want kids ever . I just ... I have my career . I like it . Having children ... changes everything . And I guess there 's a part of me that ... likes how things are . Is that so wrong ? It 's not wrong . It 's just ... I don 't know how much longer I can wait . It 's okay . Answer . Hi . It 's me . What 's with all the calls ? Of course I 'm fine . Why ? Eyewitnesses suggested that the plane ruggled upon takeoff , but there has been no official statement yet as to the cause of the crash . The area surrounding the wreckage remains off-limits as police and emergency responders continue their search for clues . I was supposed to be on that plane . Mom ? Which way ? Do you remember ? Stairs . I remember stairs . Okay . She 's not here . This isn 't it . Okay . Oh , my God . This is it . It 's his hat . You can 't make me leave . Mom , where 's Andy ? Where 's the little boy ? You want to take him from me . Mom , listen to me . Andy is not your child . - Now tell us where he is . - No ! - Come on . - How long are you going to keep this up , pal ? As long as I have to , man . You need to convince her who you are . You need to tell her everything you remember about this place , about you and her . You need to earn her trust . It 's the only way we 're going to find the boy . Mom , listen to me . I 'm your daughter . I used to live here . Over there- - that 's where I slept- - next to you , always facing the window . And here ... That 's where we practiced my handstands , remember ? One leg at a time ? Over there , there used to be a handprint right here , Mom ? You drew it there for me . Do you remember why ? So , when I was alone , I could put my hand up to it , and it would be like we were holding hands . That 's what I did , Mom , every night you were gone , because I wanted you to come home . Why did you leave me ? I had to , Mom . But I 'm back now . You led me back . Now , what about the boy ? I lost him . He was wandering alone , lost , and ... I thought he was mine , and , um , I took him to the park 'cause I thought he would like that , and then I went to get his medicine and when I came back I couldn 't find him . I thought he would come back here . Which park ? Please , which park ? Two blocks away that way . Get your mother out of here now . Come on . Grab him . Get him out of here . Come on . Son of a bitch . I don 't know who you are , but you saved my mother 's life . I did ? Thank you . Hey , man , you need a doctor ? Call 911 , call 911 . My God , he 's dead . Andy ! Andy ! Damn it . Andy McNichols ! I 'm not going to hurt you . I 'm here to help . I talked to your dad a few hours ago . I saw your tricycle . It 's sitting on the porch right where you left it . It 's all right , sweetheart , don 't be afraid . Do you want me to take you home ? Come here . There you go . It 's all right . You 're safe . It 's going to be all right . Let 's go . _ _ We have to try again . If I had gotten on that plane , it 'd be over- - all of it . We have to get pregnant . What about what the doctor said ? None of that stuff matters . I 'll do the procedure . But what about your career ? Career can wait . Our family can 't . We 'll have to pick a new donor . Um ... okay , you 're Year of the Dragon , so ... we should pair you with a snake . Um ... Here . I get a good feeling about him , don 't you ? Yeah . - You still here ? - Yeah . I 'm just waiting for them to let me back . I don 't know what happens tomorrow , but today she agreed to be checked into the hospital . I 'm glad You were right . The numbers . Everything . It all happened for a reason . If you hadn 't pushed me ... Thank you . Last night I had a dream . Same dream I 've had for nine years . We 're in a park . Jake 's on a swing . He 's smiling , laughing and ... going higher and higher , and all of a sudden , out of nowhere , he 's just in the air , and I catch him . And his little arms go around me , and I can feel his breath on my neck , and ... And then I just wake up . You 're a good father , Martin . It 's time someone told you that . You want to help me put Jake to bed ? Hey , buddy . It 's time to get some shut-eye , okay ? Jake , come on , I 'm not kidding , it 's time to go to bed . Jake , give me the book now . That 's odd- - normally he just gets into bed . He 's added a six to the sequence . What does that mean ? I don 't know yet , but it means something . Let 's go ! Jake , you stay in your room . Oh , no .

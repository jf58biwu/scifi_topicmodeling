 So , I just finished reading this book about losing your memory , It 's really good , actually , you 'll have to read it . - I 'll give it to you . - Yeah , I think I read one once . I think this one 's written by John something . He 's some professor at some school . What 's that supplement called that 's supposed to , like , Boost your memory ? I think it 's called . Kinky Balboa ? I think it 's Gecko Barbiko ? Oh , yeah , that totally sounds right . [ humming to self ] [ rustling ] [ giggling ] Wow , it 's about time . Come on , you son of a gun . [ grunting ] Oh , you 're a big one . Oh , yeah . [ grunting ] Ah ! Dang . What the ... ? [ clanging ] What the hell is that ? Hey , stranger . You should come join us . Yeah , come on in . The water is great . You might wanna take off that coat first . - [ grunting ] - Or leave it on . Come on , let 's party . [ grunting continues ] [ whistle blows ] Hey , girls ! In unison : Hi , Mrs. Pepperdove ! So you girls ready to have a good time this weekend ? I can 't wait . I 've never been camping before . I have . It 's really fun . We get to go on hikes and make campfires - and roast marshmallows . - That sounds like so much work . Can 't we just go to the beach ? Yeah , there 'd be less bugs and dirt . We 're not going to the beach . Besides , camping 's a lot of fun and you 'll learn some necessary survival skills . What 're you reading , Mary Ann ? Oh , it 's a book on Cryptids . How is it ? Oh , there 's this fascinating chapter on ... [ mimicking ] Oh , there 's this fascinating chapter on ... - You 're such a geek . - You 're such an idiot . - Spaz . - Slut . Knock it off , girls . - Sorry . - Sorry , Mrs. Pepperdove . Are you princesses done chatting ? ! If we don 't get a move on , traffic 's gonna be a bitch ! Now move it ! - [ telephone ringing ] - Yep . Uh-huh . Yeah , all right , put him on . Yeah , this is Berry . Fishermen , huh ? Third incident this week ? Okay . Well , what 's the name of this place again ? " Skull mountain " up near Ahwahnee . Uh-huh . Okay , I 'm sending someone up there to check it out . His name is Harland James . Uh-huh . Yeah , yeah . I 'll have him contact you once he gets up there . Uh-huh . All right . Thank you for calling . James , get your ass in here ! Have I got a story for you . It 's not those Jersey Devil twins again , is it ? No , this is bigger and real . Seems a man was out fishing yesterday and when his cooler full of beer went missing . 'Pears it was stolen by bigfoot . Bigfoot ? James , this isn 't some made up grainy camera footage . There are actual footprints left in the mud . This person was so close to bigfoot , he could 've kicked him square in the crotch had he turned around . So , he didn 't actually see him ? No , but I did just get off the phone with the local Sheriff and he told me this is the third incident in two days . The day we get law enforcement calling us with these stories , they have to be real . I need you to get up there and see what you can find . Oh , okay . So , where am I headed ? Some place called " skull mountain " up near Ahwahnee . Once you get there , Look up Sheriff Bubba Lopez and he 'll fill you in . You tell everyone the Tattle Tale will offer 25,000 cash for anyone who can capture the creature dead or alive . 25 grand ? We 've never offered that much for a story . I know , but we 're talking about one of the most illusive creatures in the world . If we can just get pictures of this thing , or better yet , his corpse , we 'll make a fortune . That seems a little extreme . Hey , that 's journalism . You do what you gotta do to get your story . After all these years , I 'm finally gonna get that stinking ape . James , this could be huge . Just get down there and get me that story no matter what . This looks like a good spot , don 't you think ? You know , I 'm tired of driving . It 's perfect . Okay , girls . Let 's unpack , let 's get this stuff out of the van . - We 're gonna camp here . - Isn 't there a bell boy ... Get the crap out of the van now ! You 've gotta be firm with them , otherwise they 'll walk all over you . There 's mud ? Ow ! Watch where you 're putting that thing . That 's not what you said last night . [ laughs ] What the heck is this ? ! Seriously , you two don 't know your ass from a hole in the ground . Let me see that pole ! Like she 's ever said that before . What was that ? ! She said the instructions are in German . It 's actually pretty simple if you aren 't a moron . So , have you ever camped up here before ? In fact , I think there 's a swimming hole near here . Hope you brought your suit . How 's everything going over here , girls ? I think we got it under control . Good . Why don 't you two go gather some wood before it gets dark , okay ? Yeah , it 's right over here . Yeah , this is the spot right here . Oh . I am so very glad that you called me . You ever seen footprints this size before ? Well , I 'll tell you , I have seen bigger . But don 't get me wrong , this is a very , very interesting specimen . [ sinister laugh ] Ho ! [ mumbling to self ] [ muttering in amazement ] So what do you think ? Ah , this is a very interesting specimen , Sheriff . Ah , I would like to have some plaster casts made so I can study them . So , Professor , tell me , Do you think the campers are in any real danger ? I mean , do we need to be concerned about these ah , well , ah , it 's hard to say . They 're not generally known to be very violent creatures . However , there 's no telling what they 'll do - if provoked . - Huh . All right . [ Mixed conversations ] Male biker : Wait until tonight ... At the dance off . [ laughter ] Hey , brother . Uh , oh ! [ laughter ] Sweet hog . - He is kinda cute . - Oh , yeah ? All right . What 'll it be ? Well , I 'm supposed to meet sheriff Lopez here . Have you seen him ? Yeah , he was in here earlier , but ah , he had to go do an interview with some newswoman . I 'm sure he 'll be back soon . Why don 't you have a drink while you wait ? Sure . You got any root beer ? [ chuckles ] Yeah . Well , you 're gonna pay the same price as regular beer . - It 's all right . - All right . - Here you go . - Thank you . What the hell ! Are you staring at my woman ? ! I 'm-I 'm sorry . What ? I caught you starin ' at my woman ! I-I-I wasn 't staring at anyone . Eddie , I caught this guy lookin ' at my woman . Your woman ? ! That 's my girl ! That 's my girl ! Would you two stop it ? You both know she 's mine , right ? Hey ! Knock it off or take it outside ! The Sheriff 's gonna be here any minute ! Sorry , bud . Why is the Sheriff comin ' ? I don 't know . Supposed to talk to this kid . Who are you , and what are you doin in our part of the woods ? I 'm a reporter with the Tattle Tale . Why you gotta meet with Bubba ? Well , he called with ah , some sightings of bigfoot . I came to get the scoop and um , offer a reward for whoever could capture the beast . What kind of reward we talkin ' about ? 25 grand ... Cash . Did you say 25 grand ? Yep . 25 grand , dead or alive . 'Nother round , fellas ? Sorry , bud . We gotta go . Boys . Cup of coffee , bud . All right , Sheriff . You must be Harland James . Yeah , how-how 'd you know ? Well , ' cause you 're the only one in here that I haven 't met . Thanks , bud . Bubba Lopez . I 'm the local Sheriff here . Pleasure to meet you , sir . So ... I 'm hearing that you 've been having some problems with bigfoot . Well , he 's quite a legend around these parts . Some people believe in him , most don 't . Some claim to have had you know , from what I 've heard , he pretty much minds to himself . Although I guess lately , he 's been causing some of the tourists a little bit of harassment . I 'd love to talk to some of the people who have seen him . That can be arranged . Great . Oh , and my editor wanted me to mention we 're offering a reward of 25,000 for whoever can capture the monster . First of all , Mr. James , he 's not a monster . Second of all , well , if the locals find out about that money , there 's liable to be all kinds of people running around here with shotguns and someone 's liable to get hurt . I suppose you 've got a point . So , when can we get started ? Well , tomorrow morning . - Where 're you stayin ' ? - At the Black Hawk Lodge ... - That 's perfect . - Right across the street . All right , I 'll pick you up at 9 : 00 . And it looks like the show 's about to start . All right , all right , settle down . Contest is about to start . Now the rules are real simple . The contestant that gets the loudest applause is gonna win one free night at the Black Hawk Lodge and also , one free entre at Ling 's Chinese and Italian restaurant in Norfolk . So , let 's hear it for contestant number one . [ cheers , applause ] ♪ ♪ All right . Contestant number one , let 's hear it for her ! [ cheers , applause ] Contestant number two , let 's see what you can do ! [ cheers , applause ] ♪ ♪ Pretty good . Let 's hear it for contestant number two ! Contestant number two , man .

Contestant number one , you 're the winner ! [ cheers , whistles , applause ] Come on , boy . Look what they 're doing there . Sheriff , aren 't you gonna break it up ? Huh . I would but I 'm off duty . [ chuckling ] [ hottin ' and hollerin ' ] Oh , I can smell that money . What 're you gonna do with your cut , Sonny ? First , I 'm gonna get me a new hunting ' bow . Then , I 'm gonna take the missus out to the nicest restaurant in town , order some egg rolls and spaghetti , and have us a feast . What about you ? There 's this used truck I 've had my eye on for quite some time . What about you , Roger ? I hadn 't really decided what I 'm gonna do with my half of the reward . Your half ? ! There 's three of us . I 'm takin ' half the reward ! You two can split the other half any way you want . That 's bull ! Why you get half ? ! My guns ! My ammo ! My reward ! Yeah , that sounds fair . Let 's pick this stuff up and go collect our money . I was a hand-hooked killer ! Lame . Does anyone else have a story ? Well , I do . But it 's not really a ghost story . Well , go ahead and tell it anyways . Well , the book I 'm reading has this chapter on sasquatch ... What the hell is a sasquatch ? Bigfoot . The book I 'm reading has a chapter on bigfoot , this half-man , half-ape creature . Science doesn 't have any proof that he exists , but lots of people think he 's real . Apparently , he 's eight foot tall and weighs 500 pounds . Mary Ann , you 're just making that up . No , I 'm not . There 's been bigfoot sightings all over the world . In fact , there 's been sightings in these mountains . Here ? Is this thing dangerous ? Well , he has a very distinct smell , and they say he 's extremely dangerous . He can snap a man in half like a twig . I 'm tired . I 'm going to bed . Personally , I think that was just a bunch of crap . My story was way better . Well , it 's getting late . We should all turn in . So was all that true about sockwatch ? It 's " sasquatch " . And I don 't know , some people believe in him , some people don 't . Nobody 's captured him to prove that he exists , but I like to think he 's out there . It gives me the creeps thinking that he 's out there . Well , don 't worry . You 'll know if he 's around . Supposedly , he has a very distinct odor . Wonder what he smells like . Probably like the cafeteria after fish stick day . - Ew ! - Ew ! I swear . This camping trip is the worst , ever . I know . I can 't wait 'til we get home . - The sooner , the better . - I know . Can you believe Mary Ann and her ridiculous stories ? - You didn 't believe her ? - No . And don 't tell me you believe that load of crap . I don 't know . I just kinda scared me to think some giant ape lives around here . Ah , did Morgan get all scared ? Did you want me to make you feel all better ? [ moans softly ] [ moaning increases ] [ moaning loudly ] [ moaning continues ] Mary Ann , are you awake ? Did you hear that noise ? Is it scotchwad ? It 's " sasquatch " . It 's probably just an owl . Go back to sleep . It 's just an owl . It 's just an owl . It 's just an owl . It 's just an owl . It 's just an owl . [ knocking on door ] Mornin ' , Sheriff . Mornin ' . Dang . Sweet ride . Yeah , I 've had old Darlene there ever since I was a Deputy . You ever think about trading her in for a newer model ? Yeah , well , the county keeps offering to get me a new cruiser , and I keep turnin ' ' em down . I ain 't ready to give her up just yet . Remember son , you always dance with the girl that brought you . - Ready to go ? - Yes , sir . Alrighty , then . Come on . What 's going on ? That 's the woman that interviewed me last night . Looks like she 's with that scientist that I brought in . You mind if we stop ? Sure . We can do that . Looking to do another interview , Sheriff ? No , we just stopped by to kinda see what was goin ' on here . Well , stick around . I love having an audience . Is this your new Deputy ? Oh , sorry . Simone Jennings , this is Harland James . He works for the Tattle Tale . He 's also doing a story on bigfoot . The Tattle Tale . Looks like I got some competition . We 're ready . Sorry , gentlemen , I have an interview to conduct . We 're live in five , four , three , Two ... Bigfoot . Fact or Myth . His existence has been debated for years . Adding to this controversy are several campers who have reported encounters with this legendary creature . I 'm here with world famous Cryptozoologist . Professor Trent Grover . - Professor . - Yes . You 've been called in to investigate . Were you able to find any trace of this mythical creature ? Well ... See this footprint ? Oh . This footprint was taken down by the river . This is of an adolescent male at least seven feet tall weight , hm , 400 pounds . - Professor ? - Yes . Why this trend of recent activity ? Well , this time of year is their mating season . Ah , just I wouldn 't confront one , 'cause they 're liable to be extremely volatile , ah , especially ah , when they 're horny . [ chuckling ] Um ... What else can you tell us about these creatures ? Well , I ... Can tell you a lot about these creatures . The general misconception is that they 're very simple and primitive . However , I found them to be quite intelligent . In fact , I taught one to play catch in five minutes . Wait . Are you saying that you 've actually had contact with these animals ? Oh , yes . I even lived with a colony of bigfoot 's for over a year when I was living up in Washington . I-I 'm-I 'm sorry . Did you say you lived - with a colony of bigfoot 's ? - Yes , exactly . It was an amazing experience . They welcomed me into their community and their society , and ah , I was able to study their patterns and behaviors . What exactly did you learn about them ? Ah , well ... Ahem ! I learned ah , they are extremely fond of garlic . And ah , oh , they love hot dogs , too , yes . Oh ! And they are able to mimic humans . - " Mimic humans " ? - Yes , yes . In fact , I once caught one pretending to smoke a cigarette . It was so cute . It looked like a huge monkey smoking . Well , thank you , Professor , for your time . Oh , yes , and then , there was another time we were close to a village . I saw one actually using a urinal , yeah . Of course , he was using the wrong end , - but he had the proper idea . - Well , thank you , professor . And do you know , Simone ... May I call you Simone ? Ah , there was this time in their colony that I taught one to play " Iron Man " on a Ukulele . - Thank you , Professor . - [ conversation continues ] This has been Simone Jennings reporting live from Skull Mountain . Channel 15 news . And ... we 're clear . - [ sighs heavily ] - That went well . Are you kidding me ? That guys is nuttier than a pound of squirrel poop . Well , at least you look good on camera . [ nervous laugh ] So Mr. James , how 's your story coming along ? Call me Harland . And ... I haven 't really started yet . I hope I can get what my boss wants . He 's looking for something ... Concrete . He 's even offering a reward for the capture of bigfoot . What kind of reward ? 25 grand ... cash . Wow . For that kind of money I might have to go buy a gun and go hunting myself . I know . I had the same thought . So , since you work for the Tattle Tale , I take it , you believe in bigfoot . I don 't know . I 'd like to , but it 's hard when all you have is hearsay and blurry photographs . I just hope something happens real soon . Harland , you ready to go ? Oh , yeah . I 'd better get going . - It was nice to meet you . - It was nice to meet you , too . Maybe I 'll see you around . Well , this is the place . Oh ! Wow ! This is cold ! [ grunting ] That is so fun ! You gonna join us , Mary Ann ? You know what 'd be fun ? If we just took our tops off and went skinny dipping . - I don 't think so . - Why not ? - What if someone sees us ? - Then they could join us . Come on , don 't be a baby . Mary Ann , there 's no one else around . - It 's just us . - Yeah . Ah ... No , I don 't think so . I 'm gonna head back . Be a baby . The water feels so good . [ grunting ] Ugh . It smells like wet dog . Oh . Oh , are you lost little guy ? - [ grunting ] - Oh , come here , little guy . Are you okay ? [ grunting continues ] You 're not a dog , are you ? ! [ screaming ] [ groaning ] [ grunting ] [ playful laughter ] Hey , guys . I think I see someone . Well , then we should really give them a show . Um , guys ... What is that ? - I think it 's ... - Oh , my god ! - [ screaming ] - It 's bigfoot ! [ screaming continues ] Oh , my god ! Ah ! I know what I saw . [ overlapping screams ] Seven feet tall guy and he was hairy - and then he ended up ... - Let me guess . - You saw bigfoot , too . - In unison : Yes ! You girls are taking this prank way too far ! Enough already ! But we did see him ! See ? He 's right there ! [ screaming ] [ grunting ] [ tuning banjo strings ] [ tuning continues ] [ playing cords out of tune ] How was that ? Boy , that sounded worse than the cat that got caught in the engine of my truck . Let me see that thing . [ tuning banjo strings ] There . That should do the trick . [ playing off-key ] Boy , look what you done ! I just tuned that for you ! Maybe you should just stick with a kazoo . - Told you , it 's too hard . - [ girls screaming ] That 's not something you see everyday . [ screaming ] Boy , what is wrong with you ? ! A bunch of half-naked women go runnin ' by there is no way that you came from these loins ! [ sighs ] I wonder what they was runnin ' from . There is only one thing that can ' cause that kind of fear in a person . Bigfoot . Get my gun ! We 're goin ' huntin ' ! Buford , we 're gonna eat soon . Get the salad ready . In a minute , dear . I 'm just readin ' up on this latest diet craze . Put that trash down and start tossing the salad ! [ grunting ] What was that ? ! What was what ? That noise . I thought I heard some leaves rustling . It was probably just the wind . How ' bout you fix the salad and set the table ? Food 's almost done . [ rustling , grunting ] - There 's something out there , - Damn it ! You and your imagination . Remember last year at the beach and you thought you saw a werewolf ? Hey ! I was protecting that beach . Hey , they should 've been thanking me instead of threatening to sue me . I told you something 's out there . Ahhh ! Uh . [ grunting ] It is so hot . I can 't believe how hot ... Oh , my god . Is he doing what I think he 's doing ? [ grunting ] Gross . Come on , let 's got out of here . [ grunting ] Eddie , where the hell are we ? Let 's see . The sun rises in the West and sets in the East . The sun rises in the East and sets in the West . What ? Are you sure ? I ... I know I 've seen it set in the East before . Give me that map before you hurt yourself . I know these woods like I know the back of my hand . And I don 't know where the hell we 're at . Hey , look at that . Guys ... Check this out . What do we do ? We follow the trail , idiot ! Let 's go , Skip . They 're taking off without us ! Do we have everything ? I think so . All right , let 's go . Where are you going ? The party went the other way . Relax . It 's a shortcut . We 'll beat them to the campsite . By the time they get there , we 'll already be drunk while they 'll still be picking dirt out of their teeth . - [ car stalls ] - [ coughing ] [ engine turns over , stalls ] Oh , come on ! Not now ! Son of a bitch ! [ coughing ] [ sighs ] Dammit ! What 's wrong , baby ? It looks like I blew the tranny . Well , I 'm sure someone will be along shortly . I don 't know . This road seems pretty secluded . I thought you said this was a shortcut . Well , I assumed it was . Hell , Skip . What are we supposed to do now ? We hoof it . Oh , my god ! When I say " run " , you run . We are so screwed ! Well , that 's reassuring ! Boy , get your ass up . What the hell ? You folks having ' some trouble ? Ah , yeah , my truck died , and we need a ride back to the RV Park . - Can you guys give us a lift ? - I 'm sorry . Name 's Chester . This is my son Billy Bo Bob . I 'm Skip and this is Patty . Pleased to make your acquaintance . Boy , move your ass . You folks 'll have to wait till morning to get outta here . I mean , it 's gonna be dark soon . It 's okay . We 've got flashlights . [ chuckles ] Darlin ' , you 're gonna need more than flashlights - to stop what 's out there . - What 're you talking about ? I 'm talkin ' about bigfoot . That 's just a myth , like the loch ness monster . Oh , bigfoot 's real . Seen him myself on occasion . In fact , he just got through terrorizing some women down by the river . Me and the boys been out tracking ' him . We can help you get out in the mornin ' , but you best stay with us tonight . I don 't know . Well , we got food . We 're willing to share . Come on , Skip . They 've got guns and food . We 'll be safe . Okay , we 'll stay , but it 's not because I believe in bigfoot or anything . It 's just ... I don 't want Patty to trip and sprang her ankle in the dark . [ sighs ] What a gentleman . Come on , I 've also got some supplies in the truck . Hey , maybe we should go get some firewood , daddy . Good idea , boy . Get busy . Boy 's gonna get some firewood . I was right here raking leaves about six months ago ... Yes , about two weeks ago . Something knocked over my trash cans . I saw thing thing come out from behind the rock . So ... what was it ? Yeah , I know it 's a little blurry , but that 's bigfoot . - Bigfoot . - Oh , it was bigfoot . I looked out , I saw him right up there on that hill . What happened , if I may ask ? Went in the house to get me my shotgun , and came out and he was gone . Out of nowhere I saw this-this thing standing right in the middle of the road . Pretty sure he stole my car , too . No one comes on my property without my permission , you hear me ? Are you sure it wasn 't a bear ? Are you sure it wasn 't raccoons ? I got a photo of it . Good thing for him , I haven 't seen him since . Ah , yeah . It was bigfoot . - Let me tell you something . - Mr. James , I know what I saw . - Bigfoot or no bigfoot ... - I know it is . Hm . You gettin ' all that ? That 's right . Are you guys done ? Na , just stopped by to use the restroom . - Any messages ? - Yes . The mayor called . He wants you to call him back . - Your wife also called . - Again ? Alrighty . I 'll take care of this later on , okay ? Harland , I 'll be right back , all right ? Can I get you a glass of water ? Ah , no . Thank you though . [ phone beeping ] [ phone ringing ] Hey , it 's Harland . I knew you wouldn 't be calling unless you had good news . Did you get my story ? No , not yet . Then why are you calling ? Well , I 've talked to a few people and I don 't really think that there 's a story here . James , let me explain something to you . You 're a tabloid journalist . You get the story no matter what . I know , but it 's hard because I ... Hey , I-I-I don 't want excuses . I want results . If you have to shave a hundred monkey 's and then glue their hair to some homeless guy to get your picture , then that 's what you do ! - Got it ? ! - Understood . [ sighs ] Good . Now the next time we talk , you 'll have my story ... - Right ? ! - Yes , sir . That coffee kinda runs right through me , you know ? - All right , Rachel . - Okay , Sheriff , be safe . All right , I will . Shall we ? Thank you for the food , Chester . Oh , you 're quite welcome , darlin ' . Do you mind if I ask you something ? Shoot . You said you 've seen bigfoot . What 's he like ? Well , he 's all hairy , bigger than a bear and ugly as sin . I been huntin ' him for years and I ain 't never caught him . Shouldn 't you be running away from something like that instead of chasing it ? Most folks would , but I got a score to settle with that son of a bitch . See , my brother Riff , he disappeared one day , showed up about a week later all beaten and bowlegged . Well , what happened ? While he was out huntin ' for some dinner and he got knocked unconscious and he woke up in a cave lying next to a female bigfoot . But she had her way with him , and he just couldn 't talk about it . That 's horrible . Well , that 's not the half of it . He wound up in the Himalayas , you know , tryin ' to clear his head and get away from all this . While he was out taking a leak in the snow one day , and he got punched in the head and knocked unconscious he woke up in a Yeti cave . You 've gotta be kiddin ' me ? I wish I was , friend . He found out he had been violated ... Again . And poor old Riff , He ain 't never been the same since . Oh , you folks want some more beans ? No ... We 're good . I think we 're gonna turn in . Come on , Patty . What 're you doin ? Those hillbilly 's are right outside . Oh , they won 't mind . Besides , daddy needs his sugar . [ sighs ] Not now , Skip . Come on . We might as well make the best of a bad situation . Ohhh ... Ahhh . Yeahhh . Aahhh . What do you want , boy ? Which bigfoot ? Gimme my gun . - [ gun shot ] - Ah-hah ! Oh ! You did it , daddy . Come on , let 's finish this . I wanna see its face when I pull the trigger . What the ... ? What 's going on ? I thought I heard a gun shot . I did it . ! I finally shot that bastard ! [ moaning ] Ah ... [ moaning continues ] Ah , I got ... It sure looks a lot like Skip . That is Skip , you idiot . Help him up . You shot me in the ass ! Take it easy , fella . What were you doing out here in this crazy outfit ? It was cold and I had to use the bathroom ! We thought you were bigfoot . Well , I 'm not ! [ moans loudly ] What am I supposed to do with this chunk taken outta my ass ? ! Well ... I think there 's a first aid kit in the truck . Well , thank you , darlin ' . You can go on back to sleep now . Are you sure you don 't need my help ? Na , it 's nothin ' serious . I believe we can handle it from here on . All right . Ah ! Get me outta here . Ah ! How bad is it ? I feel like I lost a lot of blood . You 're gonna be fine . The boy just barely grazed you . Barely grazed me ? ! You tell it to my ass ! Ah . Ah , ha-ha ! Barely nicked ya . Nothin ' but a scratch . It 's not a scratch . Trust me . I seen a lot worse . I haven 't . Why don 't you make up your mind ? ! - Shut up , Billy ! - I 'm sorry , daddy . [ moaning loudly ] [ grunting ] Hey , baby . Did those hillbilly 's fix you up outside ? - [ grunting ] - I know it hurts . Come lay next to momma . - [ grunting ] - [ sniffs ] Baby , you really need to take a shower . [ grunting continues ] Are you gonna stay wrapped up in that rug all night ? [ grunting ] It looks like someone 's feeling a little better . Baby , that tickles ! Ah ! Ahh ! - Ow , that hurts ! - Stop complaining ! I complain , too . Are you sure you don 't have any whiskey I can take for the pain ? For the last time , no ! Now hold still ! Ah , come on . Jesus . Ah ! [ grunting ] Baby , if you 're gonna go to the bathroom , at least take that rug off so you don 't get shot again . Ah ! I 'd be squirming ' around , too . Ah ! Ugh ! There you are ! Good at new ! [ moaning , grunting ] Yeah . Good as new , yeah . Except for the huge chunk taken outta my ass ! You 're fine . It 's just a scratch . You 'll be up and humpin' in no time . What ... ? Thanks , Chester . I owe you one . Bet your ass . I-I help . Ah . Daddy 's home . What 'd you say we ... Start the fire one more time ? Again ? Baby , I could use a little attention right now . Yeah , I know , but I 'm completely worn out . When did you get so ... Big ? What 're you talkin ' about ? I 've always been big . All I can say is ... Wow . Well , thank you . - Sheriff . - Hm ? What 's your honest take on all this bigfoot stuff ? Am I just wasting my time up here ? Hm . Well ... Whether he 's real or not one thing 's for certain , this is bigfoot country . I 've lived here all my life , and I 've never had an encounter but I 've got friends and relatives who 'll swear to what they 've seen . It 's all a matter of what you want to believe . I mean , I 've talked to over a dozen people and I 've heard some of the weirdest bigfoot stories , but there 's one common denominator . Nobody 's ever gotten hurt . So what 're you saying ? Why do people make him out to be such a monster ? Well , Mr. James ... There wouldn 't be any good if there were no evil . So ah , anybody ah , claim the bounty yet ? No , not yet . - No one has yet . - Hey , bud . You almost bagged him once , didn 't you ? What ? Wait . You saw bigfoot ? Sure did . I was down near by the river hunting ' deer . Boy , I had my shotgun locked on him ... He saw me . Turned around , walked away . Why didn 't you pull the trigger ? 'Cause he didn 't give me a reason to . I mean , he 's out there in his natural habitat . Probably trying to find some food . I figure he 's out there trying to survive like the rest of us . Can I get a vodka and cranberry , please ? Sheriff , Mr. James . Burning the midnight oil ? Something like that . Sheriff : Well , It 's gettin ' late . I should probably get goin ' . I 'll give you a holler if I hear anything . Do you guys serve food here ? No , just alcohol . There 's an all-night diner down the road . You wanna go check it out ? I 'm really starving . No , I think I 'm good . Well , I think I 'll go check that place out . Um , I 'll see you later . Yeah . All I 'm saying is that television 's a dying medium . Everything 's online now . So wouldn 't that make your tabloid obsolete , too ? [ laughs ] No . There 'll always be tabloids . People will always need more junk to buy at the counter . [ laughing ] No matter what 's going on in the world , everybody wants to read about Elvis and Aliens ... Even the worlds fattest cat . I must 've missed that issue . Are you kidding me ? That 's every issue . We 're always trying to convince people into believing things that don 't really exist . I know what you mean . The news is always preying on peoples fears . We 're only supposed to report the facts but there 's no such thing as impartiality . There 's always an agenda . Bud : Last call . I guess we should go . Where are you staying ? Um ... Across the street at the ah ... Black Hawk Lodge . Oh . Well ... This is my stop . I guess I 'll see you later . [ knock on door ] It 's later . [ phone ringing ] Hello ? Mornin ' sunshine ! Berry ? How 's my story coming ? Slowly but surely . I got a couple leads that ah ... Get any pictures yet ? Well , no , but I um ... What good is the story without the proof ? ! I know , I just ... It 's , it 's ... Listen to me , James . I really need you to get to the bottom of this story . If you can 't do that , then I 'll find someone who can and you can go back to making copies and fetching my coffee for me ! Is that what you want ? No , sir . Now get your sorry ass out of bed and go get my story ! Who was that ? My boss . I gotta get to work . Think you 'd better get down there to make sure we get our story . Now I know why I don 't usually drink this much . I can really go for something to eat . - You wanna get breakfast ? - Sure . [ cell phone rings ] - Hello ? - Hey , it 's Bubba . Listen , I just got a report of another encounter . It seems like one of the local women got up close and personal a few weeks ago with bigfoot . Well , can I talk to her ? Well , you can try . Her name 's ah , Julie Lewis . She runs the local children 's store . It 's called , " Just 4 Kidz " . Might wanna hear what she has to say . That is , if she 'll talk to you . Where 's the store located ? All right . Thanks , Sheriff . What 's wrong ? Looks like we just got our first lead . Dammit , boy ! What the hell 's wrong with you ? You coulda blown my brains out . - Sorry , daddy . - Quiet , boy . We 're in bigfoot country . You smell that ? That 's the smell of the beast . - Are you sure that 's bigfoot ? - Yep . I smelled that stink before . He 's so close I can taste him . - Ah , daddy ... - Quiet , boy . But ah ... You 're gonna get us killed , boy . What ? Oh , son of a bitch ! Why didn 't you say somethin ' ? I swear . There 's no way you coulda come from these loins . Come on , boy . Let 's get outta here . Hi . I 'll be right with you . Thank you so much . Oh , thank you . Is there anything I can help you folks with today ? Yes . Sheriff Lopez sent us over here . He said you had an encounter with bigfoot . Oh , you must be the reporter and the guy from the tabloid . He told me you might be stopping in . Miss Lewis , would you mind telling us what happened ? I don 't think so . Any information you provide would be helpful . No , I don 't think so . I didn 't even want to tell the Sheriff . Please , Miss Lewis . It 's important . Well , okay . I 've lived up here my whole life and never once did I believe in bigfoot , but now , I know he 's real . It happened several weeks ago . There 's this spot by the river where I go to sunbathe . No one ever goes there . This spot is so peaceful and private , I 'm able to relax and not be bothered by anyone , ever . Since this spot is so secluded , I 'm able to do whatever I want . Next thing I know , the sky went dark . I thought maybe someone had discovered my secret place . I couldn 't quite make out what was standing in front of me . I wanted to scream , but I couldn 't . It was bigfoot , all right . A large , hairy ape-like creature . But then , I suddenly felt a calm about the creature , like he didn 't want to hurt me . And then he was gone , just like that . So , all he wanted were your panties ? This happened several weeks ago . How come you waited so long to say something ? Well , I didn 't want everyone to think I was crazy . But when I found out about the bounty , I figured I should tell the authorities . I 'm afraid someone will kill it . Would that be such a bad thing ? It might be the only one of its kind . Miss . I 'll be right with you . Can I take this ? Oh , no , go ahead . Thank you for your time , Miss Lewis . So what do you think ? I 'm thinking we should go looking for this thing ourselves . Say ah , you folks from around here ? - No . - Not really . Well , you folks better be careful . There 's been a lot of bigfoot sightings around here . Weren 't you on television ? Yes , I was . Wow , you 're prettier in person . Say ah ... If you 're not doing anything , maybe a little later - we could ah ... - She 's busy . So , where 're you heading ? I don 't know . Got any suggestions ? The swimming hole is real nice . It 's down a ways . - Want me to draw you a map ? - Yeah . There you go . Oh , that 'll be 14.99 . Dude , that 's totally him . No way ! He 's more taller , more hairier , excuse me . What 're you guys talking about ? Bigfoot , dude . What about him ? He looks nothing like the postcard . - Yeah , he does , man . - No way . How do you two know what bigfoot looks like ? Because ... We were out partying with him last night , man ! We were out in the woods getting nicely and toasted . When we heard a noise . Then , out of the blue , there he is standing right in front of us . So we asked if he wanted to join us . All I could say is that dude knew how to party . You mean to tell me you got high with bigfoot ? No , dude . We got wasted with bigfoot . That 's right ! Yeah ! - Do you know where he is ? - No , sorry . We passed out , and when we woke up , he was gone like , - gone . - Gone . Where were you guys last night ? Oh , ah , near the ... Swimming hole ! - The swimming hole . - That 's right . I guess we know where to look . Hey , man , if you see him , can you tell him to give me back my bong ? He took your bong ? ! Ah , don 't worry about it . We 'll buy a new one . Eddie : There he is ! I see him ! [ gun shots ] Get down , boy ! Somebody 's shootin ' at us . Daddy , I 'm scared ! Hold your fire down there ! You 're gonna kill somebody ! Chester ? ! Eddie ? ! What the hell are you doin ? Sorry ! We thought you was bigfoot ! We ? Who else is down there with ya ? Me , Sonny and Roger ! Hold your fire . I 'm comin ' down . Let 's go , boy . And don 't do anything to embarrass me . Chester Scroggins , you old goat ! What 're you doin ' out here in that outfit ? ! Huntin ' bigfoot . After the reward money , too , huh ? Reward ? What reward ? 25 grand cash . You mean , somebody 's willing to pay money for that bastard ? I 'd shoot him for free . You mean to tell me you don 't know anything about that reward ? I don 't know nothin about no money . I 'm just huntin' for the hell of it . I got a score to settle with that bastard . Well , since you 're out here , too , why don 't you join us ? Oh , no , I 'm not splitting ' my reward five different ways . With that son of a bitch ! Well , I might just let you shake my hand when I haul his corpse in . - [ Farts ] - [ Howling in distance ] Whew ! Boy , what 'd I say about embarrassing me ? Chester , what in the world are you feeding ' that kid ? ! Come on , let 's get outta here before we all pass out . And good luck . You 'll need it . Oh , and by the way , you need to get of them ghillie suits before somebody takes a shot at you and takes a chunk outta your ass . Sorry , daddy . I couldn 't hold it in . There is no way that you came from my loins . Let 's go , boy . And take that suit off . You look ridiculous . I loved the swim afterwards . That was just ... What is that thing ? I have no idea . It kinda looks like a bear . That 's one stressed out bear . What 're you doing ? We gotta tell someone about this . [ telephone ringing ] Yes , Rachel ? Yeah , go ahead and transfer the call . Sheriff Lopez speaking . Ma 'am , could you repeat that ? Really ? And you 're absolutely positive ? Where did you say this happened at ? And you 're certain about what you saw , huh ? What was your name again , ma 'am ? Alrighty , much obliged . Thanks for notifying us . Hey , it 's Bubba . You ain 't gonna believe this one . I think this is the spot where the fishermen and school girls saw him . The Walter 's weren 't too far from here . Maybe we should go up to where those girls were camping . See any signs of footprints ? No . Nothing . Hold it right there . Whoa ! Take it easy , mister . Quiet ! Don 't ... move . Please , just let us go and we 'll be out of your hair . Behind you . - What the ... ? ! - Oh , my god ! Is that what I think it is ? Yep ... That 's bigfoot . It 's okay . You folks are safe now . What 're you planning on doing ? I 'm gonna shoot him right between the eyes then maybe make a vest out of his skin and soup out of this bones . Look . If it 's about the money , there is no money . I should know . I 'm the reporter from the newspaper . - Tabloid . - Whatever . Bottom line , there was never any money . We just said there was so we can get people to talk . I don 't care about no money . This is personal . My brother was raped by one of these things ... Twice . Um ... Could you repeat that last part again ? Say good night , Gracie . - Look , Chupacabra ! - What ? ! Where ? ! [ gun fires ] Dammit ! What in the hell did you do that for ? I couldn 't let you shoot him . Come on , boy ! He 's gettin ' away ! Ah ! I-I think I bruised my hambone , daddy . For the love of god ! There 's no way you sprang from these loins . Now get your ass up . He 's gettin ' away ! You had your story right in front of you . Why 'd you do it ? Because sometimes ... Sometimes the myth is more important than the truth . Hey , guys . Check this out . Looks like a cave . Well , what 're you waitin ' for ? Get in there ! I ain 't goin ' in . Eddie , you go . There 's no way I 'm goin ' in first . Fine ! I 'll go in first , but I get a bigger cut of the reward . What kind of sick freak lives here ? ! I don 't know . Is your cousin back in town ? No , not that I know of . Forget bigfoot . We really should take care of this pervert . Oh , my god ! What 's that ? ! What the hell ... ? ! [ roaring ] I still can 't believe what just happened . I know . What 're you gonna do ? I-I guess I 'm gonna tell my boss I didn 't get the story . Whatever happens , happens . I 'll probably go back to being the copy boy . I 'm sure everything will be okay . There you are . I 've been lookin all over for you . - What 's going on ? - They got him . - Got who ? - Bigfoot . They finally got him ! What the hell happened to you guys ? Nothin ' . Give us some whiskey . Ha , ha . You guys don 't drink whiskey . - We do today . - [ laughs ] All right . Keep ' em coming , bud . [ siren blaring ] All right , come on ! Get out ! Come on . Let 's get outta here right now ! Let 's go . Watch your step . What 's going on ? Looks like they caught bigfoot . Well , it 's about time . Folks , we just had a break in the bigfoot case . Here 's the thing that 's been causing us trouble this whole weekend . Nothin ' more than a man dressed up like an ape . Sheriff , you gotta believe me . This wasn 't my idea . My boss sent me . I-I didn 't do anything . We caught him in the woods . He had a bunch of makeup and costumes in the car . He claims he works for the Tattle Tale . Harland ? Harland , is that you ? It 's me Kenny the copy boy . Tell the Sheriff you know me . Tell him Berry sent me . This was all Berry 's idea . Harland , do you know this man ? Sheriff , I 've never seen that guy before . I thought not . This was just all a big joke . Yeah , well , those campers didn 't think it was such a joke ! Think your little hoax wasted our whole weekend here ? But I just got here , honest . I didn 't do anything . - Harland , help me out ! - All right , quiet you . Now I got a cell in there with your name on it ! No , I-I didn 't do anything ! My boss sent me . It was all his idea . Folks , nothin ' more to see here , just a man in a monkey suit . Come on now ! You boss sent him ? It appears so . So what 're we gonna do ? Keep quiet and go about our lives . So , I guess that 's it then . Well ... It doesn 't have to be . I 've got my room for one more night . You feel like playing the sunbather and panty thief ? It sounds like a plan . Get up , boy . Daddy , I 'm tired . My foot hurts , my butt hurts , and there 's a rock in my shoe . Hell . I 'm tired , too . Well , we tried . We failed . Maybe we should just stick to hunting ' ufo 's . Let me help you with that stone . Let 's go home , boy . Are you sure you guys don 't want to talk about it ? Bud , you wouldn 't believe us if we told you . I 'm a bartender . I 've heard every story imaginable . Come on , lay it on me . Well , we was out lookin ' for bigfoot and we found this cave . We went in and we found all these pairs of womens underwear and empty beer bottles . While we 're lookin ' around , we discovered we weren 't alone . Next thing we know , the cave went dark , and we couldn 't see a thing . Hell , we woke up in the middle of the forest with our pants around our ankles and a shotgun shot off ... I 'm gonna have to stop you boys right there . Maybe there are some stories that shouldn 't be told . There you go . Consider it on the house . All I 'm sayin ' is ... Maybe we 're the aliens , man . Like ... What if there 's creatures out there ... Afraid of us ? You just totally blew my mind . [ grunting ] [ laughs ] You 're crazy , man . Ha , ha , yeah . Ah , wa-wait . What 'd he say ? He said , he said ah ... I don 't know what he said .

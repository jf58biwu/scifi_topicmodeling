 Organic chemistry is killing me . No matter how many hours I study , I still don 't feel like I 'm getting it . Your father knows how hard you 've been working . Yeah , I 'm sure he talks about me all the time . He just assigned you to me as my bodyguard and forgot all about me . Get down ! LISA : Sara ! ( COUGHING ) Lisa , I said get down ! ( GROANING ) Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me ( SIGHS ) Did you not come to bed at all last night ? Oh , I 'm sorry , babe , I was just catching up on work and fell asleep on the couch . That Dr. Rosen 's been keeping you busy , huh ? Yeah . Yeah , he is . I never thought I 'd be saying this , but DCIS might not be such a bad idea . You don 't want to go back to the FBI , since when ? Of course I do . It 's just that , you know , working with Rosen does have its positives , right ? The cases are really , really interesting and the money 's better , right ? So , you get to remodel that bathroom and maybe even do the garage for me . Honey , you got nothing to worry about . It may be a little awkward at first , especially with Persky , but ... No , I 'm not worrying about that at all . I 'm just thinking about , you know , what 's best for us , so . I know what 's best for you . You belong at the FBI . I 'm going to make you some tea . Start your day off nice and calm . ( CAR HONKING ) MAN : Hey ! Watch it ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) TAXI DRIVER : Hey ! WOMAN : Oh ! Whoa ! Hicks , where the hell are you ? HICKS ON EARPIECE : We 're trying , Bill . ( BRAKES SQUEALING ) Screw it . Here , Rachel , take the wheel . ( PANTING ) I 'll drive . Okay , I can see him . He 's headed west on Third . " What 's in the package ? Need to know basis . " DOD just ... They just want the package . " Excuse me ! Gary , what 's his 20 ? RACHEL : Come on , move ! I don 't know . I lost him . He went into a park . There 's no cameras . We got to find this guy . Rachel , it 's on you . RACHEL : I 'm just pulling over . There 's too much traffic . Gary , we 're going to have to run . No . We just ate . You 're not supposed to run after you eat . Please , Gary . It 's a medical fact . Rachel , what is your ETA ? Gary won 't budge . I don 't care . Get here now . Gary , you have to stay in the car . Promise to stay in the car . Don 't go anywhere and do not talk to anybody , okay ? Promise . Yeah , I promise . No moving , no talking . ( PANTING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( ECHOING ) Relax . Hey . You can 't park here . I 'm not supposed to talk to you . I need to move this vehicle . I already said , I 'm not supposed to talk to you . All right , license , registration . DCIS . We ask the questions . Where 'd you get that ? I told you we ask the questions . Respect the badge . Step out of the van . Respect the badge . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) Got it . ( ECHOING ) We bumped into each other . It was an accident . We 're both fine . So you can go now . I 'm glad you 're okay . I should go now . Sorry . I got here as fast as I could . What happened ? It 's okay . We got what Sullivan wanted . You got it ? Whatever it is . Okay . Where 's Gary ? I had to leave him . HARKEN : What ? Alone ? He 's in the car . He promised , okay ? He did . Gary . Oh , God . Shoot . ( INDISTINCT TALKING ON POLICE RADIO ) I promised not to get out of the van . ( MUFFLED ) Help me . ( SOBBING ) She 's crying . She 's crying . That means that she 's sad . She 's very sad . Yes , thank you very much . So , I located Gary . He 's at the Eighteenth Precinct and he was arrested for illegal parking and resisting arrest , and for impersonating a Federal officer . So he should be out in about 15 years . Stop it . I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . No , this isn 't funny . Don 't worry about it because I will take care of it . You should take care of it because you 're the one who told me to leave him . Rachel , don 't go there , okay ? You need to take responsibility for that . So do you . People , please . The important thing is that Gary 's safe , right ? Yes . Gary is safe . Yes , Gary is safe . He 'll be safer because I will get him . Amateurs . What is wrong with him ? He 's in a special mood today . I don 't know . GARY : And then they printed me and they took my picture . HARKEN : Yeah , you know what ? Gary , you need to learn to listen to people when they ask you to do something . I was listening . No , you weren 't , Gary . GARY : You said " axe " . And then I saw the sad girl at Broadway and Fourth . Thank you for cutting him loose . You guys look pretty busy in here . Everyone 's tied up with the Lisa Collier thing . Your FBI buddies have been all over our asses about it . Really ? What 's the ... What 's the state of play ? It looks like some drug cartel , Los Funda ... Wait , Los Fundadores . Really ? I mean , what ? Ransom ? We did get proof-of-life . Cell phone video . We tried tracing it , it came up empty . Yeah , that 's her . Thank you . That 's the sad girl . Hey , Gary , don 't see the ... Don 't do that . You saw Lisa Collier ? Yeah . That 's what I keep saying , Bill . You don 't listen . I saw her on the video and then ... ( SHUSHING ) Inside voice . ( SOFTLY ) And then I saw the cell phone signal . It was very strange , but I traced it . It 's Broadway and Fourth . Wait , you know where this phone is ? Yeah , Bill , I keep saying that . You need to work on your listening skills . No , no , I need to get that phone . Come on . That 's not your pen . You sure it 's down here ? Yeah . Yeah . It 's there . Okay . ( STRAINING ) Ugh . Ugh . Toilet . I looked up Los Fundadores online . They cut people 's heads off . There 's a picture of a guy and he had blood pouring out . You should not be watching that kind of stuff . No , I know , but that 's why you 're going to help , right ? Well ... You want to help protect Lisa from getting hurt . Yeah , there 's that . There 's that . But there 's also ... You know I 'm supposed to go back to the Bureau , right ? Yeah . You broke an agent 's clavicle . They disciplined you . Not like he didn 't deserve it . Listen , they called me yesterday . They reviewed my case . They 're going to kick me out . Now , Lisa Collier 's father is one of the richest men in New York . It 's going to make this a high profile case . Now , what I 'm thinking is , if I can crack the case , that might get me back in . I need your help . Yeah . I need a partner . Can you be my partner ? A partner . Bill , partners are equal . Yes . Yes . So you can 't tell me what to do . I get my own say , Bill . Okay . All right . ( BOTH EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST ) There it is . ( LAUGHS ) I told you it was there . Come on . Come on . I 'm a good partner . Yes , you are a good partner . Partners get to drive , Bill . Don 't even start that , Gary . Miss Theroux ? Detective Kellerman . Yeah , I remember . What are you doing here ? I need to ask you a few more questions about Timothy Darren . ( ECHOING ) I need you to listen very carefully . Nina . Why don 't you move along , friend ? I got this . You in some kind of trouble ? Avoiding me isn 't a good idea . ( ECHOING ) Get in the elevator and go home . What the hell 's going on ? It 's nothing , Hicks , okay ? Just stay out of it . It 's nothing ? I just watch you push a cop , you 're going to sit there and tell me it 's nothing ? You want to know what 's going on ? Fine . That cop , Kellerman , he thinks I killed someone . Is that enough information for you ? How 'd you find this ? Agent Bell found it . He 's our resident computer genius at DCIS . No , no , Bill , that 's not my cover . We have to tell people that I 'm a data analyst . Gary . That 's my cover . What 's the deal here ? What the hell did Collier do to piss off Los Fundadores ? These guys don 't usually come this far north to pull off an abduction . He has some factories in their territory . They wanted to tax him . He didn 't want to pay . Harken , what are you doing here ? Someone found the cell phone ? Actually Agent Harken brought it in . Bill , this is James Collier , the father of the victim . And his chief of security , Sara Nelson . Mr. Collier , I 'm really sorry to hear about your daughter . This is an FBI investigation . Persky , DCIS has taken an interest . Since when ? Who 's this kid ? I 'm Bill 's partner , Gary Bell . I 'm a ... I 'm a computer genius . No , I 'm a data analyst . Agent Bell is a very gifted member on our team . I 'm a high-functioning autistic , 32 on the CARS scale . Someone please tell me about the cell phone . This phone is what we call a burner , okay ? They come pre-loaded with minutes , so there 's no billing information and they are very hard to track . So what you 're saying is it 's no help . The kidnapper should be contacting us with their demands very soon . Oh , that 's your plan ? Wait ? My daughter is out there somewhere ! Sir , you don 't need to be here . Oh , I don 't ? So then who 's going to handle this , you ? Mr. Collier , I can tell you from having extensive experience with Los Fundadores that my partner , Agent Bell and I ... Agent Bell . ... can bring your daughter back safely . Sir , this man was expelled from the FBI for disciplinary reasons . I don 't think that ... I don 't care what you think . This man and Agent Bell are the only ones that have made any real progress in finding my daughter . Everyone 's calling me Agent Bell . I think what Mr. Collier is saying is we could use all the help we can get . I agree . Don 't you ? ( SIGHING ) Of course . You 're in . Don 't screw it up . Did you get rid of that phone , like I told you ? Just a sec ! I 'm doing my exercises . I told you to destroy that thing , not throw it away . You don 't know the difference ? It 's been found . It 's a burner . Okay ? It 's not going to lead anywhere . Just because you 're civilian now does not mean you can slack off . My freaking hands are cramping from stress , too much sitting around waiting . The payoff is coming . Or would you rather get snipered , guarding some oil rig in the Sudan ? I 'm sorry about the phone . There , was that so hard ? Where are you going ? Out to get some air . Is that okay with you ? No more screw-ups . Whatever you say , sergeant . ( DOOR SHUTS ) Hey , you got to forgive Reg . He 's been through a lot . Thank you , Sandra . I ... Yeah , I 'll try not to keep Gary up too late . Yes , you 're right . It has been one of those days . ( KNOCKING ) Bye . Okay , so Bill isn 't answering his phone . And I tried the precinct , but the desk sergeant isn 't being much help and I hope they 're okay . Well , it 's no use waiting by the phone . Let 's find him . And let 's start with the precinct . Okay . I told you . I 'm out of the game . I 'm on probation . I don 't know nothing about any kidnapping . Why 's your boy waving his hands like that ? Don 't worry about him . Are you telling me if I go outside and check your car , I 'm not going to find anything ? They turned my ride inside out . I 'm clean . 235 Burnside Avenue . 11 : 15 p.m. Sound familiar , huh ? So you making a stop on the way home ? Yo , man , how 'd he do that ? He can 't read my texts , not without a warrant or something . Alonso , I 'm not playing with you . What are you going to do ? Send me back to jail . No . We don 't send people to jail . We send them to the compound . Gary . Unless they 're dead . Gary . Sometimes they get killed and Dr. Rosen says that ... Bill ! Bill ! Don 't break his clavicle ! Listen to me . Okay , man , chill . Maybe I did hear something . ( BUZZING ) Hey , it 's Hicks . Hey . So I was going to say that I was just in the neighborhood , but I think we both know that 's BS because I don 't hang out in this neighborhood . Hell , I can barely afford to walk down the sidewalk . So , here you are . Yep . ( DOOR BUZZING ) I just wanted to say I 'm sorry . So you came all this way just to apologize ? Well , I find apologies work better face to face . Okay . I 'll give you the tour . Bill , I can 't eat this . It 's all mashed together . There 's beans and there 's rice and meat . There 's green stuff . That 's good . That 's your vegetables . You got to eat your vegetables . No . There 's no division . It needs to be separate . Gary , listen to me , if you want to be a Federal agent , you got to learn to eat on the fly . No , we need to go and tell the FBI that they 're wrong . Oh , hell , no . Yeah , yeah , yeah , because the cartel didn 't take Lisa . Alonso told us . No , we 're not taking anything anywhere , okay ? Until we get more evidence . Okay , we have to build a rock-solid case before we take this to Persky . So , it 's time to step up our game , partner . Step up our game . Step up our game . Step up our game . Persky 's on the phone with Nelson , the kidnappers , ( INDISTINCT TALKING ON PHONE ) $ 10 million and the drop is in nine hours . Okay , so they made the demand . Ten million . That 's more than one million . That 's more than two million , Bill . Gary , I need you to focus . What else ? Okay , Persky says that they 'll contact them again in an hour with the location . So , did they trace the phone ? " No trace . Son of a bitch . Bastards . Keep using ... " Don 't take it personally . " One-time burners . " Bill , that wasn 't me . That was Persky who said that . See , this is where you come in . The FBI can 't trace that phone , right ? But you can . Yeah , because they 're going to call back in 60 minutes . That 's 11 : 00 p.m. , as in 60 minutes . All right , so we 'll sit here and wait . No , Bill , we have to go back to the precinct . Mmm-mmm . We aren 't going to the precinct . Yeah , the cell tower . We have to use the cell tower . On the roof . It 's a good , it 's a good tower . That 's where I get the frequency . Oh , right . That 's where I got the phone last time . Let 's go . Come on , Gary . Let 's go . Grab your stuff . No , no , Bill . I 'm separating them . Come on , we 're on the run . We 're on the fly . Let 's go . I 've separated these ... Gary , let 's go . Bill , you 're mashing it . Come on , Gary , look , Gary ! We have to go ! You ruined it . Okay . Thank you , Alonso . Gary , it 's 11 : 14 , right ? Yeah . This call was supposed to happen at , what , 11 : 00 ? Yeah . No . It takes time , Bill . There are a lot of signals . You have to be patient . Okay . Yeah , I know that , but ... Patience is a virtue , Bill . It 's a famous saying . But ... What do you , what do you see , like , millions of signals up here ? How do you know you didn 't lose the burner in all that ? Bill , each signal is unique and you have to know where to look . I know where to look . ( WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ON PHONE ) So , tell me , what do you see exactly ? Is it colors or numbers ? No , Bill , I know what I do is amazing , but I need to work . All right . Maybe I 'll just Do your thing , okay . Focus , right ? If you find that phone I 'm going to let you drive . You just made a promise . That 's right . You said I could drive . That 's a promise , Bill . I know . Just , Gary , focus , all right ? Okay . Okay . Thank you . ( ELECTRONIC WHIRRING ) ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) Okay , Bill , I got it . I got it . They 're calling . They 're late . They 're calling . Okay , good . I got it ! All right . Good , good . Yeah , Bill , give me the keys . No , no , no , no . Lessons . Bill , you didn 't say that . You said you 'd let me drive . Gary , everybody needs lessons to drive . I don 't ... You want to drive , right ? You want to talk to the guys downstairs ? You deceived me . I deceived ... ( LAUGHS ) Don 't laugh . I 'm not . I 'm not laughing at you . It 's not fair . I 'm laughing near you . I 'm not laughing at you . Are you kidding me ? 'Cause if you 're yanking my chain on this ... No , just look inside . His name 's on the tag . Oh , my God . I saw Caddyshack like a hundred times . Standing here holding Bill Murray 's hat . " Au revoir , gopher . " Yeah . Never seen it . You own the hat . It was a gift from Bill . You pushed Bill Murray ? Before I met Rosen , I was on a tear . I pushed a lot of people . Like that cop . I thought you were just here for the tour . Look . If you 're in some kind of trouble , let us help you , okay ? Rosen will protect you . Or I can just keep pushing Kellerman . You know , it 's worked so far . Well , you 're going to have to push me too because I 'm not going to drop it . Not until you tell me what 's going on . I dated this guy , Tim Darren , before I really understood my ability . And Tim wasn 't what you call a good guy . I tried to break it off a couple of times , but in this one time we had this argument and I yelled at him . And I said , " Why don 't you do me a favor and kill yourself ? " Jeez . Look , Nina , it was an accident . That 's what I keep trying to tell myself . But it doesn 't help much . Maybe you should talk to Kellerman , tell him the truth . Look , at the very least he could stop hounding you . And tell him what ? I mind controlled my ex-boyfriend ? Okay , you might want to leave that part out . Thanks for the advice , Hicks . Oh , I 'm full of surprises . That I believe . Just ... Gary , Gary , follow my lead . Put your hands down . We got to keep a low profile , okay ? Yeah . Bill , Bill , I 'm the one that 's going to find him . Go . See ? I kept a low profile . Good , good . It 's that guy . HARKEN : No . Gary , Gary ... He 's ... That 's the guy with the phone . Don 't do that ! He 's got the phone ! Man ... Bill ! Bill ! Gary , stay here ! Gary , what the hell are you doing here ? I 'm backing you up . That 's a partner ... No , stay . Don 't move . Okay . 10-4 ! ( GRUNTING ) Gary , get down . ( GUNSHOTS ) ( GARY GROANING ) It 's okay . It 's just a little bruise , okay ? It 's better than a bullet . Yeah , but there wouldn 't even be a bruise if you didn 't shove me . Well , if I didn 't shove you , you 'd be dead right now . You want to get shot , okay ? No . I don 't want to get shot . What were you thinking ? That was amateur going after that suspect by yourself . No , he wasn 't by himself . I got his back and then he shoved me . Gary . Gary , shut up , okay ? Don 't say shut up . This is personal . This is not the cartel , okay ? According to my sources , it 's not the cartel and that guy I just saw definitely isn 't Los Fundadores . I 'm not interested in your theories . If it 's not the cartel , then your whole approach to this case is wrong . My approach ? Yes , your approach is wrong . You just spooked a suspect . We 're lucky if that girl isn 't dead right now . So thanks to your little stunt , the kidnapper just raised the ransom , $ 15 million . Oh , 15 million . Why didn 't you call someone before you went after that guy ? Because he wants to take credit for the arrest for himself . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . Try and weasel your way back in the Bureau on my case . That takes balls . ( LAUGHS ) He said balls . That 's a good joke , we have to be serious . Look , Sara , Collier cannot hand over this money until we know exactly who it is that has his daughter . You had your chance . You 're done . Lou , you 're going to get this girl killed . Okay , that 's it . Arrest these two . On what grounds ? Obstruction of justice . Oh , please . Hands behind your back , sir . GARY : Ow . I was already arrested today . Anything happens to my daughter , I will hold you personally responsible . You better not have killed my little girl . ( SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKER ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Oh , my God . Oh , God , I 'm so sorry . I should have listened , but ... Rachel ... I should have listened , but I didn 't . Rachel , it 's just ... Rachel , it 's fine . It 's fine . No , it 's okay . HICKS : It 's all right . Actually I 'm going to go to a movie . Rachel , you live here . Just stay . You know what ? Uh , I should go anyway . Yeah . Uh ... Your shirt 's on the couch . Yeah . Okay . I 'm going to go to my room . ( CHUCKLES ) So I 'll see you at work then . What I said about Kellerman , just , uh , just think about it . HARKEN : Could I just bend the bars ? Gary , look , I screwed up , okay ? I screwed up . Yeah , okay , well , then we get a phone call . ( SIGHS ) We 're off the case . That 's the law . We get a phone call . It 's America . We ... If we make a phone call then we can get out of here and then we 're back on the case . No , Gary , we 're not going to be back on the case , okay ? I screwed up . No , Bill , we 're partners . We both screwed up . I have to get my shoelaces back . Yeah , well , you know what ? They don 't give you your shoelaces until you get out of here . I 'm always calling you guys amateurs ... Yeah , you are . I mean , even Rachel would have known not to do this . I should have just called for backup and organized a tail and that would have led us right to Lisa Collier and ... ( EXHALES HEAVILY ) Nah ... I put a young woman 's life at risk . Bill , the FBI , they need us to solve the case . Because we 're special and we have abilities . Yeah , we do have abilities , Gary , but you know what ? My ability got me in here . That fight with Persky and ... Lost my cool and the FBI kicked me out . My wife thinks I have anger issues . She has no idea who I am . What are you going to tell Dr. Rosen ? I 'm not worrying about Dr. Rosen . You know my wife is a little more important than Dr. Rosen . He 's here . Bill , Dr. Rosen is here . This is completely irresponsible . I had to call Sullivan to get you out of jail , and she ... She 's livid . I messed up , okay ? I deserve it . I need your help . I got to get back on this case . You put Gary in harm 's way . You risked exposing the entire team to get your old job back and what , now you 're asking for a favor ? Wait , aren 't you the one that promised me that if I joined your team , you 're going to help me get back on the Bureau ? Yes , I said I 'd try and I did , but don 't twist this around , Bill , to account for what you 've done . Bill . Bill , it 's 5 : 07 , and the drop 's at 8 : 00 a.m. We have to go . Gary . Gary , please , roll up the window . This is a private conversation . Soft top . There 's no sound dampening . It 's not about you , it 's not about me . It is about Lisa Collier . The FBI needs us . They don 't have a snowball 's chance in hell of saving this girl . I found the burner phone . No one else could have done that . Gary , please . No . No . You need to listen to him . We walk away from this , Doc , and the girl is going to die . You don 't know that . I do know that . Every fiber in my body is telling me these are not pros behind this . They just want to stick it to Collier . Why ? I have no idea . It 's not even about the money . They 're not going to give this man his daughter back . Lisa Collier was scared . She 's very scared . I saw that . We can do things that the FBI can 't . You know that . It 's up to us . Yeah , we 're moving her now . She 'll be at the new place about an hour . Okay , but I 'll agree it was a stupid move . Stop apologizing for me . Done . I hate to see you grovel like that . You had to go drinking , huh ? You couldn 't wait another 12 hours . I got parched . I 'm sorry , Reg . I really am . Wait . Wait ! ( SCREAMS ) ( SOBBING ) Better place , brother . ( MUFFLED ) Help me ! Help ! So this is all the info I have . I 'm sorry , that my partner and I have . He means me . I 'm his partner . Important thing is that we get to Lisa Collier before they make the money exchange , because once the kidnappers have the money , they are not going to keep this girl alive . Yeah , so you all need to step up your games . ( CHUCKLES ) Right . And I also just want to say thank you all very much . This really means a lot to me . I appreciate it . Bill , the exchange instructions . They 're in . Sara Nelson , Collier 's head of security and Agent Persky , they 're going to make the drop . Sara . I know Lisa 's kidnapping wasn 't your fault . It 's okay ... When Lisa comes back , things are going to be different . I 'm going to be different . You will bring her back , won 't you ? You can count on it . Okay , Nelson , she 's programming the route to the drop zone into a GPS and she 's using Nav Guide . I hate Nav Guide . It always sends you the long way . It 's quicker to use the side streets . If the kidnappers want to pull an ambush , they got spots here and here . This doesn 't make any sense . The Bronx Zoo is the drop zone ? It 's a tourist trap . It 's easy for the agents to blend into surveillance everywhere . I mean , there 's no advantage . Except it uses our resources . And keeps us distracted . Yeah . Lisa , you know , we don 't have a lot of time . I know you probably weren 't too enamored with Reg . He had his problems , but I feel like you and me , we could talk . Mmm-hmm . Great . That 's great . The thing is , the people that I 've killed , they never saw it coming , but with you it 's going to be different . ( WAILING ) Oh , sweetie , hey , it 's nothing personal . It 's just , we can 't let you go . We let you go , we could get caught . That makes sense , right ? So here 's the deal . I make it easy , like falling asleep . But there 's got to be quid pro quo . ( SOBBING ) I need to know what 's next . So once you 're , you know , on the other side , you send me a message . You let me know that there 's something else out there , something better than this . You know , rap on something . Tickle the back of my neck . Come to me in a dream . Deal ? Just nod . ( SOBBING ) Yeah . You won 't regret it . Say hello to Reg for me . ( MUFFLED ) Help me . Help me . Something 's still not fitting . Yeah , well , staring at that map 's not going to help . It 's not the destination , it 's the journey . My mom says that . That 's a nice saying , Gary . It doesn 't really work here . Gary 's on to something . Persky and Nelson 's route has to take them north on Broadway . Yeah , Broadway and Fourth , that 's near the bar , Bill . The bar where we found the phone , where you gave me the bruises . Right . So you include that route and everything happens in the West Village . ( PHONE RINGING ) Yeah , this is Special Agent Bill Harken . I need a listing of all recent lease agreements within a 10 block radius of Fourth and Broadway . Okay , which one this time ? She said apartment 25 . Apparently , he paid in cash . Okay , but Bill , this is the fourth one . Yeah , it 's called good investigative work . Just do your thing Check it out . ( WATER DRIPPING ) ( BUZZING ) No heartbeats . But something sure stinks . Blood . Okay , back up . Back up . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . I smell something else . An explosive compound . Thermite . It 's all over the door . HARKEN : Hicks , copy that ? Must have rigged it to explode . Probably on a trip wire . I got this . ( GRUNTING ) What 's taking him so long ? Piece of cake . ( SIGHING ) Stay right here . It 's the guy from the bar . They were holding Lisa here for sure . Yeah , but they moved . They knew we were getting close . They must have somebody on the inside . Gary , what 's your 20 on Nelson ? Okay , she 's headed for the drop zone . Persky 's in the car , too . " This is Persky , all units stay sharp . " Yeah , that was him . Very professional . Let 's go . Come on . MAN ON RADIO : Dispatch , this is One-Adam-Nine , uh , 10-47 . ( EXHALES NERVOUSLY ) That 's a lot of money back there . You ever get tempted ? That 's all I need . More money for my wife to spend . ( LAUGHS ) Seriously ? Not everyone has that thought . You figure , I take a little bit , who 's going to notice , right ? You know , with my luck I 'd be doing 30 years before I even got a chance to spend a dollar . How far away are we ? 1.6 miles . HARKEN : Persky can 't be the inside guy , he 's too stiff . ( MOBILE BUZZING ) Everything okay ? Speak of the devil . That was my wife . ( BUZZING ) You 're a bad liar . ( BUZZING ) Stupid Nav Guide . What 's wrong ? She 's turned it off . Who ? Nelson . AGENT 1 ON RADIO : The car just sped off . We tried to keep up , but we lost them . What about you , Overwatch ? AGENT 2 ON RADIO : Uh , negative . I don 't have a visual . What the hell just happened ? What 's going on ? ( MOBILE BUZZING ) ( SOBBING ) ( CHUCKLES ) Good news , it 's almost over . ( WHIMPERING ) We 're a mile and a half away . We 've got to find her . Yeah , no , I 'm looking . I 'm looking . There 's no street cams . Okay , look . Here 's Persky 's number . See if you can ping him . Okay , yeah . Turn , turn right . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Be careful ! Nice moves . It 's all in the reflexes . HARKEN : Uh , Sara ? Agent Harken . My , uh , my car broke down . ( ECHOING ) Tell us where we can find Lisa Collier . It 's Sara , let me in . Where the hell you been ? You were supposed to call . Plans have changed . We have to move the girl . Again ? Why ? Plans have changed . We have to move the girl . ( SOBBING ) No . You know what ? I 'm done . No one 's going anywhere until I get my money . The money ? What happened to the money ? ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANS ) HARKEN : It 's okay . DCIS . You don 't have to be scared anymore . HARKEN : Don 't cry , okay ? It 's going to be all right . Those aren 't ... We need proper handcuffs , Bill . There you go . How about that , huh ? No . Those are for groceries . Gary , let 's go . ( SOBBING ) ( INDISTINCT TALKING ON RADIO ) You 're in good hands now . I 'll be right back . Gentlemen , gentlemen . I can 't thank you two enough .

He 's a very gifted young man . Uh , you don 't know the half of it . ( LAUGHS ) Your associate Dr. Rosen tells me you 're having trouble getting back into the FBI . Let 's go . Be happy to make a call . Thank you . Good work , Agent Harken . Yeah . Congratulations . Thanks . You okay ? I 'll live . No , I mean , we never had a chance to talk about our incident . Look , I apologize . Look . You don 't have to rub it in , okay ? No , I 'm serious . Why don 't you guys take the collar on this ? I don 't get it . I thought you wanted back in . So did I.

" But , I , uh ... You know , Bill , I 'm a professional . I can gloat in private . ( LAUGHS ) Ah , sorry , I didn 't come home last night . I thought DCIS was supposed to have better hours . Bad night ? FBI let me go . Disciplinary committee ruled against me , so . I thought the director said it looked good . Guess he was wrong . Did you know ? Why didn 't you tell me , Bill ? Well , I didn 't want you to be disappointed , so . Yeah , that face right there . What face ? The disappointed face . This is not a disappointed face , Bill . I don 't ... I don 't care where you work . DCIS , FBI , what difference does it make ? So you just want a man with a job ? ( LAUGHS ) Is that right ? I want a man that 's happy . Are you happy ? I am now . Is there anything else I should know ? Um , no . I think that 's enough for one night . NINA : Well , I took your advice . It turns out I had nothing to do with Tim 's suicide . And Kellerman was looking into some financial scam Tim pulled and I told him I didn 't know anything , which was true . All that worrying over nothing . Yeah , nothing . Look , I , um , was in a weird place the other night . And ... Oh , yeah , yeah . No , I get it . Impulses . But , um , maybe dinner sometime ? Sometime . Hmm . So , Gary ... I mean , Agent Bell , I think you ... You did an amazing job . You know , you saw what mattered and you kept your eye on the ball . And the most important thing is you really did help save a woman 's life . You 're stalling , Bill . You 're stalling . ( SIGHING ) Okay . All right , so ... Ten and two . Yes , ten and two . Right ? Now put your foot on the brake . Yeah , brake . And then you 're gonna turn the ignition right there . Yeah , I know . Okay , easy . Okay , now take the gear shifter ... Pull it down to D.

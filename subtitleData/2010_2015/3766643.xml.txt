 Tonight at 11 : 00 ... Doom ... ! ♪ two ... Two , three ... ♪ Boy , that thing 's big . Fry , is my colossal eye too big ? No , it 's what makes you you . But it 's so round , so hideously round . Leela , listen , you 're the most beautiful woman I 've ever known . Oh , so you only care about my looks ? No , I ... what ? Finally , new New York got a blast of class today As Nikolai , playboy ruler of the robo-Hungarian empire , Arrived aboard his extravagant caviar-powered yacht . I am just a humble emperor with a big , big crown . Of course I 'm not planning to steal that crown . What ? True , I 've always dreamt of being an emperor , You know , for Halloween , and then forever , But heisting those jewels would be difficult . You 'd be stupid to try . I 'll need accomplices ... A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard ... Never . A claw man to slip past the metal scanner And cut the alarm wires ... Sorry , I 'm set for life after that last job . And finally , a chump To be caught on video and later arrested . As I told you on sucker-punch day , I 'm through being a chump . Of course , it would all require split-second , robotic timing . That 's where I come in . You see , I own a watch . There . This time I 'm sure I 've fixed the mind-switcher . Good , I 'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys . But why would you want your mind in a new body ? Well , as a man enters his 18th decade , He thinks back on the mistakes he 's made in life . Like the heaps of dead monkeys ? Science cannot move forward without heaps . No , what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe . I wasted my youth porking out . Yes , I remember . Would you please take that down ? It 's making me hungry . Funny , I could use a little extra meat on my bones . Wait a second . If we switched bodies , I could live life to the extreme And you could indulge your demonic food lust . we 're just the people This mind-switcher was made for by us . Wait , can I still change my mind ? Let 's find out . It didn 't work , you doddering old ... Ah , cartilage . Dude , I bid you a fond cowabunga . I 'm off to laugh at the reaper . Yee-haw ! Look out , world , here I ... I 'm sorry , Amy , but your body 's not up to the task . Also , I don 't care for these boobs Flapping every which way . Now , quit your bologna-gargling And let 's switch back into our original bodies . Body-switching , eh ? Mayhap the heist is back on . Who needs accomplices if I can just use their bodies ? Professor , what 's not happening ? Bad news , me . I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response . You idiot ! Once two bodies have switched minds , They can never switch back . However , perhaps they can . Maybe we can swap back using a third body For temporary storage space . I 'm 60 % storage space . Yeah , wha ... I ... Hmm ? Well , I 'm off to the royal yacht For a quick seduce-and-snatch . See you . Now then , Amy , we 'll simply switch bodies And then we 'll , we 'll ... No , I 'd be back In my body , but then you and bender would be switched , And the Amy and bender bodies can 't trade minds again , Since they just did . Oh , no . Is it possible to get everyone back to normal Using four or more bodies ? I 'm not sure . I 'm afraid we need to use ... Math . Stupid air-needing lungs . the crown jewels . Now I just have To locate the guard and seduce him in ... Four seconds ? ! Who goes there ? Three , two , one . Hello , big boy . Silence . I am basil , The emperor 's cousin and chief of his royal guard , And I shall not be seduced by a ... I said ... Professor , what 's the matter ? I 'm Amy . The Professor and I switched bodies . Oh , lord . All I wanted was to gorge myself a little , But I can 't digest anything with these false teeth And this hit-or-miss colon . At least you get a senior discount at the movies . I hate paying $ 14 to see Nicolas cage solve things . If you want to save two dollars , we could switch bodies . We can always switch back , right ? Hey , Leela . Mmm , what smells saturated ? Deep-fried ice cream sandwich Wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed . Whoa , that sounds like something Amy would say and eat . I am Amy . Leela and I used the Professor 's mind-switching machine . So Leela 's in your body ? Not exactly . see , you do only like me for my body . That is entirely not true , sir . Now to go switch bodies with zoidberg , Sneak past the metal detector , and clip the alarm wires , All in less than ... Ten minutes ago ? ! Uh , could you come back when my chump gets here ? Now then , What is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht ? With all due respect , your majesty , I 'm a robot like you . I just switched bodies with some bimbo . Go ahead , ask me something only a robot would know . A reverse Turing test , eh ? Very good . What is the square root of nine ? Uh , hold on , let me just get out a pencil . okay , look , I 'm not that kind of robot . I 'm more this kind of robot . He steps forwards but moves backwards . By the gods , he is a machine . No , that won 't restore everyone either . Besides , I don 't want my decrepit old body back . I 'm running away with this invincible robot body And joining something . Look , I paid for 15 robot clowns per cubic meter of car , And you 're barely giving me 12 . Now , crumple up and get in ... And fasten your seatbelts . Good day . I am Nonchalanto the robot daredevil , And my dream is to risk my life In strange and original ways . Hmm , you don 't look so foolhardy to me . That 's the dumbest thing anybody 's ever done . You 're hired . So you 're a common bending robot With a human peasant roommate ? Oh , crap , that is what I am . No , bender , I envy you . I 'm so bored with all these pretentious trappings ... The jewels , the parties , the beautiful robo-women . Hello . Ah , my fiancée princess Flavia . Dearest , meet bender . He 's a robot in the body of a Chinese Martian physicist . How tedious . Oh , to escape this gilded cage for a day . You know , we could trade bodies . I could take over the humdrum royal stuff , And you could be a regular Joe for a day . Or more , much more . In that horrid non-robot body ? Sir , I have my standards . Ah , but what if I could put you In my fabulous bending-robot body ? Me , posing as a lowly bending unit ? How wicked . But wait , I 'm supposed to give a speech at the u.N. Tomorrow . Can I trust you to do it ? You can trust anything . So now Leela 's all crotchety ' cause she thinks I 'm not attracted to her in the Professor 's body . You aren 't , are you ? Of course not , But I was willing to lie about it . What more can a man do ? A man can give her a toke of her own medicine . Yes , I could put my mind into a hideous body And show Leela she 's not attracted to me , But it would have to be a really , really disgusting body . Friends , friends , I 've got barnacles on my tuchus . The long search is over . Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body . Professor ? Leela . Amy ? Bender . Have you seen my body ? I think the Professor 's in it . Yeah , he said something about running away . Then he ran away . What ? ! Whither ? ! What am I going to do ? I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies , But only with another robot . Washbucket full . Scruffy 's work here is done . Now to find emperor Von Richendoof . Now to find scruffy . Switch bodies ? I don 't see why not . I also don 't see why . In your face , Leela . If you 're a bender , why is your body full of fetid water ? If you 're an emperor , why don 't you shut up ? ! Move it , fry ! Oh ! Well , so long . Wait . Point me to my normal human roommate ! That 's him there ... Maybe . Got to go ! Robot ? Yes , ' tis I ... Bender . Do you not recognize your own best friend ? Aha ! The guy in this body has a friend ! Bender , old pal , it 's me , the fry ! But then Nicolas cage discovered The real treasure was his family . Yes , I 'll hold . Hey , Leela , look . I 'm in zoidberg ! Fry ? ! Oh , you 're not so shallow That you find me repulsive 'cause of my body , are you ? Not at all . Amy ? ! Stop it ! Fry , help ! She 's turning me into a parade float . Ew , look at her ! Oh , so you 're so shallow that my body disgusts you If it puts on a little extra weight ? That wasn 't a little extra weight . Admit it . You don 't care about the inner me at all . No , you admit it ! You 'd be ashamed to be seen in public With someone as hideous as me ! Would not ! Oh , yeah ? Then I challenge you To a romantic dinner at Elzar 's tonight . It 's on . Sweet orca of Majorca . You make fat Albert look like normal Albert . I don 't know what to do . Do you think I should eat more butter ? I am putting a stop to this right now . Come on . We 're switching bodies . Hermes , no ! I 'll ruin your body , too ! Three decades of the munchies beat you to it . You make quite a show , young man . You remind me of myself as a young cannon . Big Bertha is the circus 's Grande dame . She shoots robots through the air . Oh , excuse me . Too much goulash . I 've always wanted to be shot out of something . How about a quick blast after lunch ? Alas , a fine big one like you would shatter my barrel . But , ah , to amaze the crowd once more . I understand the problems of age , But suppose I could put you in a new body ? Never ! My body may be old , but it is mine , And every crack , a memory of heavy things shot a long way . Good day ! I have everything I ever wanted ... Money , wealth , riches . Yet something 's missing . A hot princess with whom to get grizzly . Hello . Hello , baby ! Hey , what 's going on here , and why are you kissing My dashing cousin instead of me ? Nikolai , you imperial fool . We 've been having an affair for 700 years . At long last , I shall kill you , Blame the burglar , and inherit the throne . Farewell , Nikolai . Wait . I 'm not Nikolai ! I 'm bender , the fabulous body-switching burglar . So you are . However , you do have Nikolai 's body , And that 's the part we want to kill . Whoa ! Whoa ! Great food , huh ? Ew ! I 'm sorry , Leela . I hope that didn 't make you ashamed to be seen with me . Oh , my , no . Excuse me . Oh , did my bodily infirmity embarrass you ? Not at all . It 's just another thing That makes you a very special lady . You mean , like my penis ? Blech ! Yecch ! Admit it . You 're disgusted by me . No . You 're disgusted by me ! I 'm as attracted to you as I 've ever been . Prove it ! Well , bender , here 's our apartment That we live in every day . A floor ? We live like kings ! Kings ? Silence ! Like you , I 'm a common lout . Now fetch me some working-class cognac From our Brandy storeroom that you know how to find . Relax , bender . I 'll dry up that leak with this heating box . Ah . Cigars . Light me up , old friend . There you are , emperor Nikolai . It 's time for your speech to the u.N. A what now ? Miss Wong ? No , scruffy , I am washbucket . I love you . Washbucket has always loved you . This is wrong , washbucket . Oh , it would be sweet for a while , But in the back of our minds , we 'd know That I 'm a man , and you 're janitorial equipment . In another city , we could be anyone we want ! Go . Go now . Before I beg you to stay . Yup . Please welcome an insane dictator And one heck of a bowler , emperor Nikolai ! Thanks , Nixon . How we doing ? I love you , your majesty ! Shut up , madam ambassador . I know it . Anyhow ... I 'd now like to digress from my prepared remarks To say I 'm done . Ladies and gentlemen , this robot is an impostor ! I shall enjoy this . Not me ! Oh , no ! That devil , basil , will kill our emperor . You 're robo-Hungarian ? Yes . Our nation 's chief export is carnies . If only there were some way I could get to the u.N. To help . There is . Get in , Nonchalanto . Bertha , no ! It would kill you ! I have not so much time left anyhow . But you could get a new body . You could have a rich , full life ! I am trying to have a rich , full life . Long live robo-Hungary ! Me ! Thank God you 've come ! This is for big Bertha ! Wah ! That is not what I meant to give you for big Bertha . That was nice . Oh , yeah . Hey , stop kicking me around ! Whoever you are , You 're the bravest robot I 've ever seen . I like killing brave things . Good , ' cause I 've got 20 of them per cubic meter . When I grow up , I want to be a diplomat ! Well , if there 's one thing I 've learned , it 's a lesson . I believe this belongs to you . I shall sell it to help the common folk , Now that I understand their misery . Yeah , good luck with that . I must say , Hermes , you 've got a smoking hot body . I was inspired by Amy . Wow ! How 'd you do it ? Well , there I was at Elzar 's Eating a nice pork sundae , And suddenly , I just lost my appetite . Forever . Q to the e to the d . So it is possible For us all to get back to our original bodies ? Stone-cold munching ' , prof . Sweet Clyde , characterize your inversion theorem . Basically , no matter how permuted-up your minds are , They can be restored using , at most , two extra players . And they say pure math has no real-world applications ! Everybody back in their zones ? Ah , my body may be old , but it is mine . Brilliant work , Clyde ! You 'll win the NBA 's highest academic honor for this ! Also , I 'm making you a Duke . So long , filthy commoners ! Adios . And I 'm left with the real jewels safely inside ... His compartment ? ! Oh ! All right , listen up . I 'll need accomplices .

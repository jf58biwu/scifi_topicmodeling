 Top of the morning to you , little dude ! Hey , eat shit and die of eating shit . Whoa , that 's no way to treat your friends . You 're not my friends . We 're the only ones that know what you 're going through , little dude , and where you 're going to . You can 't escape your destiny , loser . It 's either us or no one . I 've got real friends ! Ones that will stick by me no matter what ! Not for long . Is that a threat ? Whoa , whoa , far be it for us to threaten the destroyer of worlds . But a shitstorm is brewing , bro . And you 're the asshole at the center of it . And your friends ? They 're just gonna be swept aside . And casually fucked into nothingness . He 's saying they 're all gonna die if they keep hanging with you , loser . Yeah , I got that , asshole . Rob : Whoa , not the finger ! You 're too hard-core for us ! ( Laughing ) What are we gonna do about Todd 's problem ? You know he shaved his nutsack and now it 's super itchy and in-grown ? Guys do that ? Well , not me . I rock the dick beard . It makes my porksword look like a wise old wizard . Curtis : And I mean old . That sounds far worse - I 'm talking about Todd 's bigger problem . We need to find out what happens if he really is the pure evil one . It means he 's gonna destroy the world . Or something . I for one think we need to keep him from doing that . Jenny : Uh , yeah ! He could be more dangerous than the book of pure evil . Curtis : Whoa , you guys - you 're talking about my best friend here . Maybe all he needs is for us to tell him we love him . Jenny : Can 't we tell him we like him ? It 's sorta the same thing . Love 's more powerful . Love conquers all . That 's so sweet . Can we get back on track here ? My dad was researching the book when those satanists kidnapped him . He must know something about that prophecy they were talking about . Too bad he 's in a coma - but he could snap out of that any day now . Like right now . Thanks , Curtis . Look ! Dad , what are you doing here ? " Dear Jenny , your father is a vegatable . " Which is why I 'm leaving him . " With you . Forever . " Love , mom . " Curtis : Yeah but there 's something on the back . " P.S. Forever means I 'm not coming back . " Harsh . Hi ! I 'm Leslie ! You wanna trade sandwiches ? ! Why would I want to trade sandwiches ? Maybe you eat my sandwich and I eat your sandwich and we become friends ? â™ª " Expello ... meus ... Solitudo ... eternus ! " Subsfreak Okay , listen up , you old geezers . I 've got an important announcement to make . I too have an important announcement to make . Are you telling me your announcement is more important than mine ? Most assuredly . Get on with it . Make it snappy . My fellow brethren - our ancient society recently suffered a terrible and painful loss when our beloved Minion Bob died at the hands of the book . You 're not being snappy ! Fine ! Now that he 's gone , we need to replace him ! So please welcome our new fourth Minion - Fred . ( Clapping ) Minion Bob 's ceremonial robe . Sorry we didn 't get a chance to wash the blood and feces off it . Atticus : Yeah , welcome to the family , Minion Fred . I 'm sure you 'll be just as mediocre a Minion as the rest of them . Now onto the real important announcement . ( Clears throat ) I 'm the pure evil one . At least I will be , once you deliver me the book of pure evil . Questions ? Comments ? Praise ? Yeah , let 's start with Minion George . If this is a joke , I don 't get it . No . Not a joke . Okay , you 're trying to set up a bigger joke . Yeah , like a prank ! Look , I just told you guys I 'm the pure evil one . That 's ... Big news ! I thought somebody ... Would be excited by that ? Did you just say you want us to get you the book of pure evil ? Because we haven 't been outside of this home in almost twenty years . ( Laughing ) You 're all so useless ! That includes you , Minion Fred . Atticus : I 'll find the book myself ! What a dipshit ! ( Laughing ) You 'll fit in just fine , Minion Fred ! So our goals should be : Get the book before Atticus does . And destroy the book before Todd becomes - ( whispering ) The pure evil one . Thanks for the reminder , Hannah . I think he heard you . Sorry , Todd , but it 's something we have to deal with before you hurt anyone else . Ow ! Your arm 's made of metal , idiot ! You shorted out my arm ! Okay , careful where you - whack ! Curtis ! Aim that . Sorry , I didn 't mean to fist your dad . That metal arm is dangerous ! It could kill somebody ! I 'm the one that 's dangerous . I mean , I almost killed my best friend . After I tried to kill you , dude . Let 's call it even . No you were under the book 's power . I wasn 't . Look , even if we get the book before Atticus , there 's no way to destroy it . And if I really become the pure evil one - I don 't want you guys around when that happens . Maybe if we find out more about the prophecy we can stop that from happening . It 's time for me to be my own dude . I need to do this alone . Todd ! Todd , wait ! We love you ! Did Todd just break up with us ? ( Brody whistling ) Nice robe , sweater dude ! Oh , I keep forgetting to take this off - it looks great . Really . Totally flattering . Really ? Loser . I 'm getting mixed messages from you guys . He 's not easily impressed . Oh , you 'll be impressed soon enough . You all will when I lay my hands on the book of pure evil and complete my ascendence to become the pure evil one . Brody : Just remember - only the pure evil one can control the power of the book . Yes , me . And only me . Who is who I am . Yeah , you might want to lose the robe before you go into the school . Fuck ! Keep forgetting to take this thing off ! ( Laughing ) Hi . I 'm Leslie ! What 's your name ? Uh , my name is " get out of my face , fannypack . " Would you like to be my friend ? Yeah ! I 'm like so glad we 're friends now ! You and I are gonna be very close . Would you like to be my friend ? What ? Hello , Todd . Oh great - so glad I bumped into you . I 've got a big surprise for you . But I can 't tell you what it is , because I want it to stay a surprise , so you 'll be surprised when you hear it . What ? I 'm gonna destroy your little gang ! There is no gang anymore . It 's just me and you . And I 'm gonna find the book before you do . Then I 'm gonna kick your ass . Believe me , my ass can take a lot of pounding . I didn 't say pound . I said kick . Same thing . No , it - it really isn 't . Yeah - it is . Fine . Have it your way . I 'm still gonna find the book before you do . Oh , I 'll find the book before you , Todd Smith ! And I 'll be waiting with anticipation ! For that ass-pounding . Atticus : Who has the book this time ? Is it the makeup face children ? Is it the pornographic fantasy ladies ? Is it the preppy bags of douche ? You were so right , Leslie ! Trading sandwiches makes them taste better ! I like it when there 's too much sandwich ! Double-meat sandwiches , wow ! I make fancy sandwiches for my dog ! Would you people keep it down ? ! Curtis : I 'm really worried about Todd . What if he is the pure evil one ? What if he can 't control himself ? I saw him lose control and almost kill you . You know , Hannah , you look really sexy when you 're scared . I 'm not scared , I 'm just - what ? You think I 'm sexy ? Totally . I 've never been called sexy before . I don 't know how to react . So many new emotions . Say it again ? You 're sexy . I could get used to that word . Sexy - how about super-sexy ? Oh ... That 's even better . How ' bout ... ultra humpable ? Let 's stick with super-sexy . Hey guys ! Do you wanna be my friends ? Friends to the end ! Todd : First , I had the book - then Hannah had the book - then there was tiny Todd - and then - oh , right ! Sexy twins . Were the sexy twins before or after tiny Todd ? Male : Who wants to eat a hoagie ? ! Female : I do , I do ! Male : Love meat fries ! Female : Me too ! Hey , will you people keep it down ! Female : I love meatballs ! Meatballs are the best ! Me again , Hannah . Where are you guys ? Call me ! Something 's not right . Ew ! Knock it off , assholes ! Mr. gunderson : Okey dokey , yesterday we left off discussing palm reading and I thought , uh - what the hell is that ? This is my dad , Mr. gunderson . Yeeeah ... I don 't wanna know . I just want you to take the old man in the wheelchair out of this classroom . I have nowhere else to put him . Not my problem ! He 's creeping ... Me out . Anyone else feel the same ? I 'm sorry , Jenny . Democracy has spoken . Stupid democracy - that 's not even a fucking subject ! Sandwich is a very smart the person ! Curtis : What if we put a sandwich inside a sandwich ? I 've been looking everywhere for you guys ! Wanna be friends ? Oh my ... Fuck - ahhhhhhhh ! You look a little frazzled , dude . What 's up ? Oh - hey , Jimmy . I 'm just looking for the book . Isn 't that what that gang is for ? I sort of ... Broke up with the gang . How come ? Well , they 're afraid of me , and maybe they should be . They don 't wanna hang out with you anymore , I get it - no , no , they wanna hang out with me . They do - alright , then what 's the problem ? I 'm afraid that if they keep hanging out with me they 're gonna like - die . So I 'm thinking it might be better for me to just kinda go off on my own . You know , like a lone wolf . Alright , lone wolf sounds cool . Yeah , but it 's actually kinda lonely . Well , you 'll get used to it , though . And jerking off a lot , right ? Alright lone wolf , I 'm gonna let you be - hey , uh , if you 're not doing anything maybe you and I could ... Hang out . Aren 't we friends ? Yeah . Oh - yeah , the - ( Clears throat ) I guess the best thing for you Jimmy is to - stay away from me . Alright , suit yourself . ( Laughing ) Hey you guys , you know what we should all do tonight ? Have a sleepover ! That sounds like so much fun ! We should do it at Leslie 's house ! Everybody bring their pajamas ! Or , not - it 's been really great having all these new friends and all but I think I might need a little time to myself . Why would you want that , Leslie ? We 're all here for you ! No really , I just need some space - why would you go anywhere without your friends , Leslie ? Yeah , we 're here for you , Leslie ! We 're always here for you ! Friends to the end ! Curtis : I 'm hungry ! Can we get some corn chips ? ! How about we order a pizza ? ! With pineapples on it ! And ham ! That sounds good ! You should patent that ! It 's called a hawaian pizza ! Jenny : I like sausage ! You can 't put sausage on a hawaian pizza ! You people are driving me crazy ! Holy Jupiter shit ! Mr. Murphy ! I need your help ! Let me guess , you have the book . Here ! Take it ! Well , that was easy . Come on , Atticus , be friends with us and Leslie ! Now that I have the book you wanna be friends ? That ship has sailed , bitchface ! I mean friend-face ! Hahahahaha ! Todd : Hello ? Is anyone there ? Curtis : Hey Todd ! Come and join the student body ! Look , a new friend ! Hannah : We always need more boys ! Jenny : And I like sausage ! Hannah : I like pineapple ! Holy ... Shit . I 'm surprised that this doesn 't surprise me . Atticus : Look , it 's my favorite Nemesis , Todd Smith ! And you 've got the book . I 'll show you the power of pure evil after our pizza sleepover ! We 're still doing that , right ? Leslie : Help me ! All I wanted was some friends ! But they 're smothering me ! You don 't mean that , do you Leslie ? That 's what I love about Leslie ! She 's such a kidder ! Curtis : Leslie , you really have a great sense of humor ! ( Flesh tearing ) Leslie : Ahhhhhh ! And a great scream . So true ! You know , you guys are really making a great case for membership . All : Join the student body , Todd . It 's so nice in here . We 're getting along so wonderfully . No one has to be alone . If being alone is what it takes to keep my friends safe , then I have to be alone . All : Resistance is futile . You will be friended . Really ? All of you guys are friends ? All : Friends to the end . How can all of you guys be friends ? I mean - do you guys even know anything about each other ? How well can anybody know anybody ? Yeah , your friends say that they 're there for you . And that they understand what you 're going through , but - they don 't really know . At the end of the day ... We 're all alone . Or in Elliot 's case , alone under the bleachers jerking off to Wanda doing her cheerleading routine . What ? ! Gross ! You know what 's gross ? The smell after Curtis leaves the washroom ! That 's true . Hey , that 's my boyfriend you 're talking about ! You actually got somebody to go out with you ? ! Hannah : Shut up ! That 's so rude ! At least they don 't call her margarine . All : Huh ? Because she spreads easy . ( Laughing ) You suck ! You all suck ! You know who 's the worst ? Leslie ! All : Yeah ! She acts like she 's friends with everyone , we don 't even know who she is ! Yeah - ( students talking ) Leslie : Oooooow ! Aw - ( students grumbling ) No , no ! Please , no ! ( Students groaning ) I hate teenagers ! ( Flesh tearing ) You 're tearing me apart ! Literally ! Ahhhhhhh ! ( Blood spraying ) ( Students groaning ) Holy Jupiter shit - what just happened ? Let go of the book , Atticus ! It will destroy you ! No , you will be the one who is destroyed . By me ! You can 't control its power ! That 's what you think but you 're wrong ! I feel the book 's power pulsating through me - me too - pulsing ! It 's not just you - I think I can - I think I can control it - yes ... ( Evil Todd ) Yes , I know I can - ( energy pulsing ) No , it is me ! I am the one who controls it ! They 're getting all pure evil-ey - Todd 's a bit more convincing . Jenny : Todd , listen to me ! You don 't need that book . What else do I have going for me ? None of you trust me . And why should you ? I 'm always getting you into danger , risking your lives - the book of pure evil ... Is my only true friend . No , the book is my friend ! That 's not true Todd . You have us . You don 't have to do this . Hannah : We 'll save you , Todd ! Curtis : All of us , together ! I can 't stop destiny . Thud ! ( Energy pulsing ) Todd , no ! Ugh ! You haven 't heard the last of me ! I still work here ! Every day , eight am ! I 'm here to make your lives hell ! Uhhh ! Are you okay , dude ? I was gonna use the book again . I couldn 't stop myself . Jenny : That 's why you have us . To save you from yourself . I guess - I can 't really fight the book without you guys , huh ? Nope . And you don 't have to . Hey , it 's like we 're the student body . But in a good way . Now that we 're back together , what do you guys want to do ? Throw rocks over the overpass ? Todd : Yeah ! Uh ... Shouldn 't we be looking for the book ? What was up with Atticus ? He 's just doing what he always does - trying to get the book and stuff . Why do I feel like I 'm forgetting something ? ( Pat groaning ) Jennifer ! Dad ? ! Ugh - he thinks he 's the pure evil one ! Either he 's insane or else he 's an even bigger idiot than we ever imagined . Could be 50 / 50 , Dave . We cannot allow this farce to continue even if he is our hooded leader ! Drastic measures must be taken . Sodomy ! Let 's not be too hasty . He 's still the only one who can deliver us the book . My knees can 't keep up with all this running around . If he delivers it . He has before . I 'm certain he will again . And then what do we do with him ? Sodomy ! Fred , give it a rest . Once Atticus brings us the book he will be of no further use to us . Which means ... Death to all false prophets . And then sodomy ?

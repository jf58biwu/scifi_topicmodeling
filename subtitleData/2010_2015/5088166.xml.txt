 You gonna get that or what ? No way ! We 've got to hurry ! We need to pack . I don 't have all the details , but I do know that it 's one night only , out in the middle of the desert and the party of the century ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . The desert ? You know I got issues with sand and large spiders . Would you rather spend your Friday night here ? Ooh , the kid has a point . You two , my office ... Now ! Hope this won 't take long , White Knight . Bobo and I were just heading off for a big night of ... Paperwork . Change of plans . You 'll be attending an underground party in the Sonoran Desert . This better not be some sort of punishment , you know , where you offer something cool , then yank it away to prove your twisted point . Do you want me to send another agent ? No , no , no ! We 're cool . Just one question ... Why ? Because the entertainment is being provided by a group of ... Evos . How progressive . So , let me guess ... You want me to shut them down . With civilians there , we can 't just send in the tanks . I need you to observe the situation and report back so I can decide how to handle this . So you 're assigning us ... To party . Just the two of us . Actually , there will be three of you on this one . Aw , no ! No ! No way are you going to make us bring Six to a party . Six isn 't who I had in mind . Kenwyn ? So you 've met . Agent Jones just graduated from the academy ... Top of her class . I 'm excited to be working with you , Rex . And thank you for your trust in me , sir . I promise to do my part to make our team as focused , efficient , and methodical as possible . Is it too late to get Six instead ? ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ You 're not thrilled about this , are you ... About me on the team ? What ? No ! I ... it 's just ... Worried I 'm gonna cramp your style ? Never crossed my mind . I 'm not here to have ... Fun . That 's gotta be a tough act to follow . He doesn 't even leave you a stage . Hey , I was a rook once , too . Just relax . You 're with a couple of old pros . Right , Bobo ? You don 't have to worry about me . I can pull my own weight . If you say so . ¿ Que tal , party people ? In simulation , we always started an infiltration by establishing focus points . What ? No , no , no . Forget what you learned at the " Academy . " In the field , you need to go with the flow . That 's what works for me . If we want to maintain our cover and get the job done , we really need to set up our focus points . Yeah , well ... I don 't even know what that means . But I do know that I 've been doing this job a lot longer than you . So ... I graduated the academy as a lieutenant , so ... I 'm the ranking officer here . Why couldn 't it have been Six ? I like your blouse . Uh , I , uh ... Hey ! Kenwyn ! So , I see you met Skwydd . Hey , thanks for the tip . This party is awesome ! He 's a friend of mine from Hong Kong . We go way back . Charmed . Is she your , uh ... date ? Date ? ! No ! No , no , no ! We just work together at Providence . We 're here ... undercover . Rex ! Don 't mind her . She 's a little skitchy around evos . Sorry . It 's just , this is new for me . It 's new for lots of people . That 's why we 're doing it . This is Etude . Etude , this is Rex . He 's here from ... Milwaukee ... Wisconsin . He is from Milwaukee , Wisconsin . Well , no matter where you 're from , welcome . Need a background check on an Etude ... Mid 30s , male , Caucasian . Don 't forget " total hippie " and " possible criminal mastermind . " We got to keep moving . White Knight is going to be expecting us to report in . Yeah . I 'll catch up . By the way , you got something on your face there . Looks kind of like a ... Smile . Don 't think I 've ever seen one on you before . Whatever . I always said , if I got to be a freak , might as well get paid for it . I 've recon 'd this room . Let 's go . - She 's a load of laughs . - Yeah . First time we met , she pretty much tried to kill me . Hmm . Funny ... last time we met , you tried to kill me , too . It 's the thought that counts . Well , I need to go at least pretend to be on a mission . Oh , yeah , about that ... I figured since you 're a big secret agent and all , you 'd want to know . Some of the performers have been getting threats . What kind of threats ? Ah , you know , the usual stuff ... " Die , evo , die . " Nothing to get excited about . I 'll check it out . Hey , Rex . It 's really cool that you 're here . Never seen a crowd scream at an evo and not want it dead . I ... I 'm not going up there . Oh , Mouse , please . I haven 't even seen you perform yet . Why not share your beauty with us ? She 's scared . Probably stage fright . We 'll go instead . No , we won 't ! Yes , we will ! Ah ! Thank you , thump ! Hey . A little Skwydd told me some of the evos have been getting threats . Hear anything about that ? Excuse us , please . What ? ! Uh , one ... our cover . And two ... what threats ? Why didn 't you tell me ? We should 've reported that back to White immediately . Yeah , see ? That 's why I didn 't tell you . You just broke seven of the eight most basic safety protocols . Relax , okay ? This isn 't my first mission ! I know what I 'm doing ! You 're right . You 're the veteran . All I can contribute is what I learned in training . I just want to earn your respect . The way you already earned mine . Can 't you understand that ? Oh . Yeah . O ... okay . Look , I just know from experience you can 't report everything to White . Sometimes things aren 't as bad as they sound . Yeah , that sounds pretty bad . Huh ? Skwydd ! What are you doing ? ! I don 't understand . Skwydd 's never been able to make his nanite ink solid before . He 's out cold . We 're not getting any answers out of him . You know , when you need to talk to a suspect , there are methods of restraint that ... First of all , I didn 't even hit him . It 's like he was so amped up , he just burned out . And second , he 's not a suspect ... he 's a victim . It doesn 't matter . I 'm making the call to White . Wait . What Skwydd did ... - Something 's not right . - I agree . The evos here are obviously a threat . No , I mean , it doesn 't add up . Skwydd was happy . Okay , it 's Skwydd . Maybe that 's an exaggeration . I 'm not getting a signal . But he was as happy as I 've ever seen him . Why would he mess with that ? Can you help me with this ? In a second . Listen , someone did this to Skwydd . Probably the same guy who made those threats . Rex , stop stalling and help me ! I am . White likes answers , not questions . Trust me on this . The minute another civilian 's in danger , we 're making the call . Come on . Nothing bad will happen . You got me here . Well , that 's reassuring . He 'll be fine in there until he wakes up . Oh , no , no ! Everybody 's leaving ! If this thing breaks up , the guy who did this to Skwydd is just gonna slip away . Maybe that 's good . No one else here will get hurt . But then there 'd be nothing or us to do but go home . And I haven 't got my party on yet . Wait ! There 's been a small disturbance , but ... Everything 's cool now . So , uh ... Party on ! Come on ! It 'll be cool ! Eh . If that 's all he 's got , I 'm out of here . Unh ! Hey , Rex man ... nice ! I guess it 's safe to say you just blew our cover . Or we showed up with a talking monkey , I 'm kind of world-famous , and wearing that outfit , you totally blend . Haven 't you ever heard of dressing for success ? It 's a good day when I can find my socks . So , what 's next ? If we 're gonna catch our guy , we need to start interviewing suspects . Most important thing is to isolate them first so they can 't run when ... Hey , Thump ! Or ... we could just do it your way . We need to talk . We got nothing to say ! If you 're scared , I can protect you . I 'm not scared ! They are ! - Didn 't you see what happened to Skwydd ? - Yeah , and that 's why we should tell him . She 's been acting funny . You should talk to ... Aah ! Mouse ? ! It 's always the furry ones . Aaaaah ! - She 's no evo . - Of course not . I 'm the furthest thing from an evo . I am a human being . It 's disgraceful what you 're doing here . Evos and humans should not mix . You were responsible for Skwydd , weren 't you ? What did you do to him ? Just shining a little light on how dangerous his kind can be . By juicing his powers ? What were you thinking ? Most inorganic material explodes when given that kind of molecular jolt , but not nanites . They convert the energy into power that amplifies an evo 's abilities to uncontrollable levels . What are you ... a science teacher or something ? 9th grade ... 25 years . But if you 're not an evo , how did you do that to Skwydd ? Oh , I didn 't do it , sweetie . My partner did . We got to get all these people out of here . Hold her tight . Who are you ? Proceed to the exit in an orderly manner ! Aah ! It 's a fact of nature that our kinds should not mix . Everyone here is guilty of a terrible crime . And now comes the punishment . Rex ! Can you hear me ? Rex ! Providence , we need backup . Do you copy ? Come on , Kenwyn . Keep it together . Rex ! When you call Providence for backup , I 'm the one they send . Move everyone into one of the side caves ... now ! Unh-unh ! You 're not getting away ! Oh , I know . No one is . Rex can dig us out of here . But not before we 're all blown to little itty-bitties . You 've got a bomb ? Of course , sweetie . He 's right over there . I hear ya , but any party with no line for the bathroom can 't be all bad . Aah ! Unh ! Unh ! Do me a favor , will ya ? Hit him ! I don 't want to hurt the guy . It 's not his fault . Aaaaaaaaah ! - Unh ! - They 'll live ... If any of us do . Now that he 's amped himself , he 's gonna explode and take everyone here with him . - That 's what Mouse wants . - Oh , come on ! That nutjob makes her big villain speech and leaves that part out ? - We need an action plan . - Got one . Punch him till he drops ! Aaaaaaaah ! Rrrrrrrah ! Unh ! Ohh ! If I hit him , he blows up my machines . If he hits me , he 'll make my evo powers go berserk ! I can 't do anything ! But since I don 't have those problems , I can ! He 's gonna blow ! Hey ... Nice timing . Guess we should thank him for making you able to do that . Yeah . Too bad I can already feel it fading away . Oh , thank you , thank you ! Mwah ! Mwah ! Mwah ! Yeah , all right , whoa ! Easy on the man kisses . What happened ? Well , let 's see . An evo and a human were working together to prove evos and humans can 't work together . But then a human and an evo worked together and stopped them . That 's sweet . But what I was really asking was , what happened to me ? ! Oh . She did . Rex did what ? Like I said in my report , he ... Did everything by the book . I 'm very ... Surprised by that . Me too . Well ... That 's my report , sir . Is it , now ? Then you are leaving me no choice , agent Jones ... But to make sure you two get teamed up again . Hmm . - I 'm actually cool with that . - Me too . Whoa , whoa ! Where does that leave me ? If I had to guess ... With a lot less to do . Oh . In that case , welcome aboard !

 Previously on Caprica ... My time at the STO is leading me on a different path . Robot , shoot this man ! Stop ! How did you get that robot to stop ? I don 't know . I just told it to . This girl , Lacy Rand , exerts an unexplainable control over war machines we bought in the black market You know what needs to be done . I 'll see to it . The Guatrau can 't know I 'm sending robots to the Tauron resistance . Fidelia Fazekas . What the frak ? I 'm looking into some stuff for the Guatrau Looks to me like two in every two dozen or so robots isn 't making it to the military . What , has he got you checking up on me ? Just getting me up to speed . If we are to work against the Guatrau , we 're gonna have to do it together . I need to finish what I started and take down Clarice . This is the same model as clarice 's , but I 've had it rigged . Amanda , I need you to get back in there , bring me back the original Hold on a second . This isn 't your band . - Amanda . She took it . - Everything is on that band . We have 24 hours to find Amanda . I 'm determined to bring Zoe back to the real world . Tamara is alive in v-world . She 's with my daughter . They are holed up together , deep inside the game . To reach them , I need a fighter . I need to get my family back . - You ready ? - Yeah . Good boy . Good boy . What makes you think they 're in these woods ? The last set of coordinates placed her avatar here . This whole environment is Zoe 's creation I 'm gonna go up ahead and get some bearings . I still don 't know what you need me for . With any luck , we won 't . You two stay put . I assume you 're not checking out his ass . I recognize that face I don 't trust him . Gods . Look at these leaves . Each one is different . And this light . It 's all so ... incredibly real . And I don 't have the foggiest idea how she did it . Can 't have been purely intuitive . Generative algorithms ? Stocastic processes ? Now I remember why we put the lab in the basement . I 'm just saying , it 's one thing to write code , but ... what Zoe 's done here is ... Well ... It 's closer to what the gods did in the old creation myths . Whatever our daughter is , she 's not a god . Gods , I hate this place . What the frak was that ? Dragon fighters of Kobol . What ? Zoe 's favorite book , when she was a kid . She 's clearly expressing her rage . - Trying to scare us off . - Or kill us . She wouldn 't go that far . Would she ? You know , in v-world I could actually get a ship like this right now And some day , they 're gonna be able to zap memories of having a ship directly into your brain . I just think it 's more fun to do the thing . If that 's what you want . The women and men have sailed on these ships ... to be at sea for ... oh gosh , a really long time . Sometimes the Captain wouldn 't even let them set foot in port because he knew they 'd never come back . So they wouldn 't get to see their homes for years . I wouldn 't mind that . You still miss your mom a lot , huh ? Oh yes . A ship 's crew is a lot like a family . You know ... they might lose a member And they just bring someone else on board who could ... Well . The family might change , but what 's important is that it 's still a family . Do you think I could go and play in v-world ? If that 's all right ? Yeah , of course . Cool , thank you . Give him time . You 're wrong . You asked for proof , I found it . They cooked the books brilliantly ... but there were holes for anyone willing to look closely . Don 't act superior . These are good men . What they 're doing , supplying these robots to the rebels , is going to be very popular Popular with the stratiote , popular back home . And that makes you look bad . It 's a slap in the face , Guatrau . It 's Samuel and Yosif . - I know . I know they 're like sons to you , but I am your actual daughter . Oh , come now . Which is why you trust me to tell you ... the truth when everyone else is afraid to . Especially in a matter like this , when you can 't face it yourself . And the truth , father , is that they are becoming a threat . Quick and painless . Yes , Guatrau . Come on , come on . Let 's go . Come on . Sync : Jenny , T. , Malkavian Transcript : Lu _ Tze Dad , there 's someone at the door . It 's okay , Willie . Go back to you room . And stay in there . Evelyn . - What ? - Get back upstairs . Get ready to call Sam . Just do it . - Frankie . - Joseph . Come on in . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . The Guatrau wants to see you . Okay , look , let me tell Eve . Just make a phone call from the car , grab a jacket , let 's go . - Look at me , I can 't see the Guatrau like this . - Okay , go . Hey . Easy . Easy . Nothing personal . Nothing personal . Joseph ! Oh gods ! Oh gods ! Never liked that one . I 'll call your brother . It 's okay . I 'm okay . So , you guys really buyin' to this one true god stuff ? I mean , not the way they 're going about it , not all the ... killing . But underneath ? Well , yeah . How exactly did you end up in a camp of die-hard monads ? I didin 't ask to be invited to this little party . I was drafted . By my parents . Now back to the question at hand . The one true god is love . Love pure and simple . Love , okay , so is that why he teaches us to kill in his name ? I mean , I don 't care who you are , pollys , monads , whatever . It seems like all they care about is killing each other . Not all of them . And the STO ? Come on , our so-called teachers ? You really think they speak for god , those animals ? No . I don 't . Okay , Lacy , because they 're gonna kill you . - What ? - Ignore him . - Coto makes him mean . - No , no , reason it out . Lacy controls the robots . That threatens them . But they 'll get over that . And when they do ... Bullet to the head . Half an hour . - What ? - That 's how we worked in my time . If I didn 't call in within half an hour , another shooter was sent to follow . We 're gonna have to disappear . All of us . Head off-world . Sam , where the frak are you ? Okay , listen . Frankie just tried to kill me . They will be after you too . You know where to meet me . Ruth , could you go get Larry ? - Bring him to the spaceport . - Yes . - Evelyn , you and Willie come with me . - Where are we going ? Goldie 's Sam and I kept a stash of cash , and fake docs in case we ever needed to run . - What are you talking about ? - Goldie 's may be Sam 's place , but ... - No , no , no , we don 't know that . We 're running from our own people . ยก Yosif ! I 'll pick up the tickets and meet you at the spaceport . Come on , let 's go . And if the Guatraus sends anyone after me ... A safe journey . You 'll forgive me , soldier Sinclair , but ... I 'm a little puzzled . I know you have a problem with Lacy Rand . I just want to stay out of it . Whatever it is you 're gonna do to her , I mean . I have no loyalty to her . My loyalty is to the Soldiers of The One , nothing else . So you 're just here to clarify . Precission is an admirable quality in a soldier . I like it . So let us be very precise about where you stand . Kill Lacy Rand for us . What ? No , my entire point was I wanted to stay out of this , completely . At first I thought we 'd have to shut the power off to half the city . But then I found out that the Graystones have their own subcircuit . - Good . Makes it easier . - Exactly . So , we approach the property , right to the front gate . We force our way in , not triggering any alarms . We move up the drive , not triggering any motion sensors , 'cause , again , the power is down . Once we 're inside the security perimeter ... We have to jam anything coming off the generator , including their phones . Now , our mole at the GDD said that any calls that actually ... do make it to the police will be ignored , but ... Don 't see the point in taking any chances , right now . Are you sure you 're gonna be able to keep it together ? I 'm fine . So once all the alarms are down ... we just have to force our way to the front door and the house is ours . You are not welcome . Please leave the premises immediately . I thought you shut him down . - You have five seconds ... - So did I. ... until I initiate action . Five , four , three , two , one ... - Do you hear that ? - Yeah , let 's go ! Emergency service , please tell me what the ... Security barricade initiated . Frak ! Can you get us in ? Yeah , I can get us in . It 's- - It 's that way . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . The avatars ' coordinates are at the top of this hill . So what happens when we get face to face with the girls ? It depends . If it comes down to them or us ... there 's gotta be a way to slow them down or stop them , right ? We should play poker some time . I might soon get my company back . What does that mean ? Well , first you say there 's no way you 're goona help me ... Then you call me back and say you 'll do it for the money . - I really should have asked for more . - What do you want ? I want to find my niece , that thing that looks like Tammy So I can put her out of her misery , let my brother move on with his wife . You show me how to kill Tammy . And I 'll protect you and guide you to that creature you think is your daughter . And then ? Frak , I don 't know . Play house with her for all I care . And what if I don 't want to help you kill Tamara ? I blow you and your wife out of this game and you never see your daughter again That 's an interesting first offer . Let me counter . You can 't buy me off , Graystone . Sweetheart , we were negotiating ! Oh yeah ? I told you I didn 't trust that guy . If you tell him how to kill Tamara ... - he 'll kill Zoe too . - You don 't know that . Yes , I do . How did you survive without me all these weeks ? 5 MISSED CALLS 9 TEXTS WAITING Sam , where the frak are you ? OK , listen , Frankie just tried to kill me . Frak . Two ... three . Here we go . - Olaf , get this monitor up . - Got it . I just have do decrypt and drain the Graystones ' backup systems - And that is gonna open the door ? - Yes , it will if you leave me alone . - Nestor , they 're in v-world . I thought you had all communications shut down . It 's some type of protected circuit , I can 't get the loop . Look , just let me focus on get the door open . Is that my holoband she 's wearing ? I can 't tell . They look the same to me . Why don 't we just shoot her ? And rip open her frakking head ? A have an idea . Okay . Come on , transport 's gonna leave without us . Yeah , I just gotta get my stash . What , you can 't go ten minutes without lighting up ? No , not in this place . What are you doing ? Down on the ground . - No . - Down on your knees . - No . - Get on the ground , Lacy . - No . - Get on the ground ! - What are you doing ? - Stay down ! - What are you doing ? - Stay down ! I 'm sorry , Lacy . How far is it up that mountain ? I don 't know . Maybe another eleven hour of walk ? And Zoe can just blink an appear ... - somewhere else in game ? - Well , yes . She can have us running in circles till we 're old and grey . Or one of her monsters kills us . I could try to come up with some sort of a virus , flush her out of the game . I 'm just going to wait here until you 're done talking crap . Well , what ? What ? We 're going about this all wrong . Trying to grab Zoe in your black room ? Chasing after her in v-world ? Zoe 's too much like us . She 's contrary . If you chase her , she dodges . If you corner her , she lashes out . But if we invite her ... Let her come in her own terms . Yeah . Finish it . It 's because of the robots . I 'm afraid so . You have anything you wanna tell me ? Did Clarice blend you ? No . Ah , soldier , you were doing so well . Get back ! Get back ! You get back . Got his key . We can take the spare transport off-world . - Good . - Yeah . Let 's go , now . We 're not running . We 're not ? Follow me . Robots , power up . We 've got work to do . All right . If we do win her back ... do we put her in the robot again ? I 'm working on it , just in case , but I can 't imagine it would keep her happy . For the time being , we have a virtual version of our house . We could meet there and interact . Holding her would feel as real to both of you ... as this . But it 's not real . It 's useless without a body . You can make her one , can 't you ? Olaf ! I think I 'm in , check the door ! I 'm here . And ? - It 's opening . - Oh , thank god . Wait ! - There 's another door behind . - Of course there is . That 's okay ! It 's okay ! I think I can just use the same code sequence . For the inner door . I just need a minute . Oh gods , it 's so cold . I can feel it in my bones . Can 't we just take off our bands for a second , just to warm up ? If we do that , we lose all progress we 've made in the game . We have to start over . Frak that . You 're lame . Come on , Zoe . What 's that ? Whatever it is , it 's not real . It 's not real . It 's not real . Zoe . Frak ! Step back or I 'll supress you . We 're not here to hurt you . You cannot hurt me . Not anymore . We just want you to come home . That 's all . You don 't want me . You want her . - To you , I 'm just spare parts . - You 're right . You 're right . I 've done a lot of damage . I see that . And I 'm sorry . I 'm ... so ... I 'm so sorry . That 's the best you 've got ? You think that by telling me that I 'm gonna fall in your arms ? - Daddy 's little girl ? - No , I don 't expect that . Gee , you are smart . Zoe ... Sweetheart ? I 'm sorry , do I know you ? Look at me , Zoe . Look at my face . Don 't you remember me ? Those are her memories . Not mine . Look at me , Zoe , right here , right now . And tell me that you don 't remember me . Yes , okay . I remember . And how does that make you feel ? Hate . I hate you . I fraking hate you , you stupid disgusting cow ! Zoe . Please , just go . I hate both of you . You know where we are . We 'll be waiting for you . Whenever you 're ready . Always . I 'll think about it . What happened ? What is it ? Something is draining up power . Using the reserves . - Ah , there 's been a break in . - Oh , gods ! How long do we have ? Are they coming in ? I don 't know . Well , how long do we have before they get in ? Don 't bother , they 're jamming all the phone lines . - How long , Daniel ? - I don 't know . All right . I 'm gonna get close , see if anybody 's in there . - You know how to work this thing ? - Yeah . Okay , if I 'm not back in ten minutes ... - tale Willie to the spaceport . - Don 't go . - You 'll be okay , I promise . - Dad . - Okay ? - Be careful . Sam ! Where the frak were you ? He really did this ? He tried to kill us ? - We thought he got you . - No , I 'm good . I 'm good . Let 's do this . - You guys sit tight . - I love you . Come on . Daniel , they 're bypassing the fail safe . Oh , no . Hey ! Move away ! Hands up . Don 't move . Don 't touch anything . We 're unarmed . - Come here . - We 're unarmed . Move . Sit down . Sit down ! Where are the bands ? Over there . Where is the band you stole from us ? I 've hidden it somewhere where it will be publicly relased ... - if I don 't check in ... - It 's being analyzed as we speak . They 're lying . Search for it . It 's not here . I just wanna talk to you . I loved you . I thought you were special . You made Zoe . Don 't talk about my daughter . Why not ? I mean , I was more of a mother to her than you ever were . - You sent her to die on that train . - Oh , you think I led her ? No . No , she led me . She was the one that talked to angels . They guided her . Zoe saw it all . She was just a kid . You didn 't really know her at all , did you ? Neither of you . - You have all the power in here . - Oh , shut up ! I 'm gonna kill you ! I 'm gonna kill you ! And my god will applaud me . I want to know god . What ? I ... I want god in my life . You ? I 'm not remotely capable of grasping the universe ... but clearly there 's a spirit ... vastly superior to man , which is what always humbled me and I want to know . I want to know something bigger than myself , something ... cleansing and forgiving ... - of all that I 've done . Oh , come on ! And all that I 've left undone . Please . Please , sister , please . Please , have mercy . Have mercy . Bring me to the light . I don 't wanna be limited by time and space . I want to sleep well after life 's ? fever . Please , please show me to the one true god . - Oh , come on ! He 's stalling ! - Show me the one ... Please , sister ! Please ! Zoe . That 's right , Clarice . It 's me . Zoe ! Oh , thank you . Here , here , put this on . - I 'm gonna link to her now . - To where ? Virtual home . How far up does the water go ? About half a click , and then you hit static . Not nearly as ellaborate an illusion as New Cap City , but ... I can make it bigger . Assuming that I stay . You 'll find it 's an exact replica of the home you grew up in With every bit of confort at your fingertips . But the bigger lure is a real-time clone of my entire computer network . You and I could operate in tandem , sharing data as we go . Data for what ? For building you a new body . Compact , agile , with full sensory input . And with skin . Skinjob ? If you will . It 's as good a name as any . Are you in ? Okay . My brother has a place you would absolutely love . We might be able to stay there for a while , on Tauron . To stay out of sight , you know ? You could go fox-hunting . - It 's been 20 minutes , they 're not back yet . - They 're fine . He has these two dogs that work as a team , they drive- - Willie ! Willie ! Let 's do this easy , yeah ? Where 's Frankie ? He 's gone . Come on , Tommy . Let my brother go , right ? - He 's got a kid . - Wish I could . Willie ! Go , go , go ! Come here , Willie . Hey ! It 's gonna be all right . Sam ! Sam ! Sam ! - It 's his hand . They 've hurt his hand . - Willie ? Hey , hey , kid . It 's okay . It 's all right . You saved our asses , kid , you did good . - Yeah , you did it . - It hurts . - I know , I know . I know it hurts . - Come here . Come here . It 's okay . - It 's okay . - He 's very cold , Yosif . - Okay . - It 's okay , buddy , it 's okay . Wait a minute . Oh my gods . Oh my gods . Sam ... We gotta get him to a hospital . We gotta get Willie help . - Help me . - Give him to me . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Give him to me . Let him go . Let him go , Yosif . Let him go ! - Let him go . - Come on . Willie ! Willie ! Willie ! I 'm sorry , Yosif .

 I 'll give you the recap . These are the microscopic machines called nanites . I can build cool gear out my body . I * * * the evo . The most evos are lucky like me . They usually look like this . I know what you 're thinking . And they smell bad , too . There 's one other thing I can do that makes me even more special . Some evos , I can cure . That 's why I work for Providence . We 're the people you call when an evo is tearing up your lawn or attacking a city . And the worst of them is this guy ... Van Kleiss . The last time we fought , things got a little out of hand . I 'll admit it ... we pretty much got our tails handed to us . He steals the key , wrecks headquarters , hijacks my nanite to get back the powers I took away from him . And now he can actually make people into evos . Then , to top it off , he has his dog boy Biowulf throw me , overboard at 6,000 feet . Not that anyone 's keeping score . Sure , Van Kleiss may be back , but so am I. So what if he can make evos ? I can still cure them . He may have new powers , but guess what ... I do , too . Ever since my powers came back , I 've got the ability to make amazing new machines . Now I just have to figure out how to build more . ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ If you 're trying to check up on me , Six , the answer 's still a big fat I can 't figure out how to make this new build . It might take some time , but you 'll get it . And meanwhile , Van Kleiss is out there doing who knows what . I wish they 'd hurry up and get the h.Q. Rebuilt . You 're not still living out of your jump jet like some ninja hobo , are you ? My temporary accommodations are perfectly adequate . Yep . Still living in the jet . I hate being kicked out of our house . Although , as long as they 're building stuff , I need a hot tub . Madre ! Estas viva ! Como puede ser ? No querida . Soy la prima gemela diabolica de tu madre . What are you watching ? Cultural enrichment . Later on , we find out if Dr. Suarez chooses Isabel or her evil half-sister , Anna Maria . Pero como va sobrevivir ésto nuestra familia ? Con mucho dolor , venganza y arrepentimiento . If you 're gonna stay with me wile they 're rebuilding Providence , at least don 't flaunt the fact that you don 't have a pre-calculus test in three days . Pre-wha ? Exactly my point . And when I agreed to this , I wasn 't expecting the sidekick , too . Hey , pally , we 're a package deal . Live with it . Was that a toenail ? Did I just get hit by a toenail ? ! What 's your deal ? Aah ! It went in my mouth ! Ugh ! Okay , that is gross . Bobo , bad monkey . I thought this would be fun . For you , maybe . I 've got a real life , too , you know . As much as I want it to be , it can 't be all fun and games all the time , Rex . Why not ? Works for me . Hey , I like adventure as much as the next guy , but I till have to pass math . You 're not going to fail math . You have like the fourth highest GPA in your class . It used to be third . And 10 years from now , nobody 's going to care . Hey , doc . Miss me ? Huh ? Oh . A situation . Really ? Awesome ! Nope . I 'm not doing anything . Be right there . I 'm gonna go pound some evo into submission . Want to come ? You 're serious ? No . That would be you . Have fun with that math . Save the world or a chance at a scholarship ? All right ! I 'm coming ! Now see ? It 's a lot more fun when you just let go . Can 't you hold that thing still ? Dibs ! That 's a whole lot of agents for one evo , doc . They weren 't here for the evo . That ship is carrying the new power core for Providence headquarters . This thing just happened to show up when we started to offload it . Van Kleiss ! Did you see the mark ? Van Kleiss made that one . Why else do you think I 've been trying to get a sample from it ? I don 't know ... just being science-y ? Ugh ! Yeah ! Does that work for you ? It 'll do . Got it . You can cure it now . Unless you like getting thrown around like that . No hurry . This is great . What hit me ? That would be me . You work here ? What do you think , mister ? Ahh , my back . Yep . Sorry . Was trying , you know , not to die . If he works at the dock , that must mean Van Kleiss was here . Actually , I think he still is . They 're after the power core . All this for a battery ? Not just a battery . It could fuel a country the size of abysus for a decade . And it was going to be underneath my room ? ! Excuse me . Out of the way . Coming through . I was wondering when you and your hair would show up again , Van Kleiss . Back to your old self again , I see . And how are those new abilities developing ? Just fine . Thanks for asking . Here 's where I bet you 're thinking , " did we really think this plan through ? Was using some poor dude as decoy the best move ? " I suppose only time will tell . Not as strong as you thought ? Not yet . That time I really thought I had it , okay ? Ohh ! How awesome was that ? What part ... you clobbering van Kleiss or Van Kleiss clobbering me ? Well , both , actually . Hold on . I need a second to think of a really good dig . Why are you smiling ? We just owned you . It 's over , Van Kleiss . You lose ! That was the best you could come up with ? " You lose " ? That one didn 't count . He caught me off guard with the whole smiling thing , okay ? You 'd be wise to consider delaying your celebration for the moment , Rex . You 're about to have your have your hands quite full . Oh , really ? And how do you figure that ? Here 's the part where you must be thinking , " did I think this plan through ? " Noah ! Are you nuts ? ! Stop it ! Stand down ! Take it easy , Noah . You 're going to be okay . This will all be over in a second . Great . Just great . Go ! Noah , if you can still understand me , when I said you should let things go , this isn 't exactly what I meant . Headache . It should be about balance , you know ? Take care of the important stuff but leave room for a little fun . Right now ? Too much fun ! Everything 's fine . Not a problem . If you can 't stop him , it 's going to be . You know , Six , you really need to learn to think positive . That stupid grin . It 's like it 's all just a game to him . I know you . Yeah , uh , thanks , but ... You 're that " Tex " kid from Providence . Uh , Rex . - Ma 'am , this really isn 't ... - I have a bone to pick with Providence . Do you realize how awful it 's been ? Uh , funny story . He 's actually my friend , so as soon as I can catch him ... Every single night , someone moves my glasses . I leave them on the nightstand , and when I wake up , they 're on the dresser ! Glasses ? There 's got to be an evo in my house . Some of them only come out at night , you know . Uh-huh . Now , I keep calling you people , but no one will give me the time of day over there . So , you tell me ... How am I supposed to feel safe when there is an evo in my apartment ? ! Here . First number on speed dial . It 's eating the cat food , too ! That friend of yours is a walking disaster . I 'm starting to like the kid . We 'll get this . Go . Rex , can you hear me ? A little busy right now , doc . Then I 'll make it quick . The active nanites Van Kleiss creates are highly unstable . If Noah isn 't cured soon , his condition will be permanent . How long do I have ? It 's probably different for each infected person , but I calculate less than an hour . Noah , you have to listen to me . If I don 't change you back , this is not going to turn out well . Please . Let me help you . No ! No ! Thanks a lot , guys ! Noah , I 'm serious . Stop playing around ! This isn 't a game , Noah ! Huh . Maybe it should be . Okay , Noah . I give up ! You 're it ! Better not be another train . All right ! Aw , no . Well , what do you know ? I 'm " it " again . - Rex , any luck ? - Yep . I got him . Stand by . This isn 't going to hurt . I promise . - Rex ? - I 'm too late . I don 't believe this . My best friend 's an evo forever ... And not even a cool evo . He 's the annoying , breaks-stuff kind . Ugh ! Actually , Rex , it might not be Noah . Your biometrics have flat-lined . All that running around . He just wore me out . Did you hear that ? It 's me , not you . Just give me a minute . Noah ? Don 't even ... No , no , no , no , no . No ! No ! I don 't believe this . You really need a hobby , Van Kleiss . I thought we could settle things without distraction . Here is as good a place as any . I already kicked your butt once today . Ready to go again ? The question is , are you ? It 's hardly a fair fight . Oh . Then I promise to go easy on you . What ? You think I don 't have my powers or something ? I 'm about to give you the pounding of the century . Come on , powers . Please come back ! Don 't you have anything better to do with your life than come after me all the time ? Funny you should ask . Doc ? How are those biometrics looking now ? Give it a try . Ah , yeah ! It 's about time ! Machines work . I just hope the important part does . What just happened ? Do you remember anything ? It all kind of hazy . I mostly remember the feeling of ... Fun . And I remember you punching me in the face . Yeah . Sorry about that . I thought you were trying to eat me . Come on . We 've got a rat to catch . Why so happy ? Is this the part where breach shows up and rescues you ? Actually , no . This is the part where she takes your inadequately guarded fuel core . Six to post , what 's your status ? Six to post . Another decoy ? I should share some of the credit with your friend over here . He played the part to perfection . Gee , thanks . Now , this would be the part where breach shows up . I can 't believe I did all this . Sounds like I had the time of my life . It almost became your life . Sorry about that . Are you kidding ? Just knowing I was a rampaging evo is cool . I wish I could have remembered at least some of it . It 's probably all over the news if you want a replay ... At least until you stepped on the news van . Well Guess it 's back to quadratic equations . I have no idea what those are . I 've got somewhere I need to be . See you later . I know . I 'm not supposed to be here . I don 't care if it 's a construction zone . I 'm moving back . It 's all right . Turns out you 're not the only one who feels that way . You 'll get used to the cold showers . Food , you 're on your own . From the top ? From the top . What were you trying to build , anyway ? A water jet . Oh , by the way , I need a new cellphone . Yes ? It 's after my glasses again . - Glasses ? - This time I am serious . Now , when are you going to send someone out here ? - Ma 'am , I 'm ... - Do you even work for Providence ? - Yes , I work for Providence . - What kind of a flimflam outfit is this ?

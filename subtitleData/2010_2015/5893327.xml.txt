 '3 , 2 , 1 ... get it ! 'Come on - here we are ! ' Hello ? Who ? It 's Grace Kaukonen for you . Who ? She sounds British . Hello ? Yeah , I see . Yeah , no problem . Yeah . I 'll be right there . You gotta go now ? It 's 9.30 . That 's what 24 hours means , honey . Waste pipe broke - they got sewage spilling into the rec room . ' .. a back-handed catch and then slams against the fencing , 'spinning away from the wall at the end after a fabulous catch ... ' Danny ? Leanne ! Subtitles by ~ pinkmei ~ Pansh familii ! Anton ? Janus - you 're all going to die ! I want to help you and I believe this is right . It 's just I don 't think I can . Do you think I wanted to be Mr Rabbit ? Well , I 'm alive . I have Christian Donaldson . But I want Amanda and Tess safe . Jessica 's gone . What ? Philip ? Philip Carvel ? Philip Carvel is alive ! Philip 's alive ? We need to talk . You want to speak to me ? You have something to tell me ? Fucking ... Fuck ! How long have I been asleep ? Two days . Straight through . Can I have some food , please ? Remember this ? Philip ? Jesus , don 't call him Philip ! Why not ? Pietre and Donaldson are out and Grant 's in his own world . We 've been here for two days ! Why the hell are we doing nothing ? What is it you wanna do ? Look , he saw a news story and said , " Janus - you 're all going to die . " It was USNC News , an American network , which means we can 't get it online , so we need to break into their offices . What ? We need to steal it , and show it to Anton . Then we go and talk to Dugdale . Break in ... ? What are you on ? And fucking Dugdale 's with them ! I don 't believe he is ! And your judgment 's so great ! What does that mean ? No , come on . Let 's have it out . You called Milner . Oh , here we go . After everyone saying , " Don 't call Milner , don 't call Milner " , you called Milner . It was a mistake ! Was it ? Was it , Ian ? Are you that fucking stupid ? Or ... are you actually quite fucking smart ? Your insults are increasingly cryptic - what the hell are you saying ? Maybe you 're doing stupid stuff because you want it more dangerous . Christ 's sake , Becky ! You 're getting off on it . Fucking psychobabble ! It 's not IT any more , is it , Ian ? Getting a buzz , are you ? Nice little danger bone ? Gonna nip off for a little five-finger frou-frou ? And you 're obsessed with wanking ! Well , let 's face it , you 're not into me any more ! No ! No , I 'm not . Right . Can I ask why ? Ask your pal - Donaldson . Fuck 's sake ! Why 's Anton drawing on my Utopia ? It 's time you knew something . But you can 't tell anyone this , Grant , all right ? Anton is Philip Carvel . Nah . What , Anton ? Mad Anton ? Do you remember anything else about that story ? Are you sure it wasn 't about the vaccine , or V-Day ? Nah , it was just about a cat on a fucking Hoover . Anton went nuts . Right . I 'm going . Fuck this ! I can 't just sit here . These are nice . Did you use salt ? Er , yeah , but just a pinch . It 's nice . Tasty . Do you do that while you 're cooking them or after ? After . Otherwise you lose flavour . Actually ... do you mind if we talk about you breaking in with a knife and not my eggs ? So you 're in charge of the vaccine , Michael ? Look , I ... I know how this looks . But I thought all this Janus stuff was over . Geoff said we had to keep making the vaccine . You know , all the fuss last year - he couldn 't just stop . Well ... well , he paid me . Money . Jessica , I am not with them . Michael , don 't worry - if I thought you were with them , you 'd be dead . I know who Mr Rabbit is . But Mr Rabbit 's dead . Grant killed him . Mr Rabbit 's alive . I won 't tell you who . I 've put you in enough danger , and you 've been really kind to me . I 'm sorry your wife left you . And you must miss Alice . Look , I 'll stay a day or two . I 'm trying to find Ian . There was something between me and him , you know ? Oh , right . Because I thought Becky ... Yeah ... I like Becky . She 's not for him , though . Can I ask what we 're doing here ? Excuse me ? Why am I here ? Oh , nice . Live feed . Where is that - Greece ? Albania ? Am I getting a new identity too ? Yeah ... Albania , I reckon . No CCTV , cash-based culture . Yeah . Albania 's where I 'd go if I was retiring . So , um , what the fuck 's going on ? Arby 's saving his family . Oh . I didn 't see you as a family man . This is all about family . Oh , here we go . See ? Tess and Amanda are safe . 'Hello ? ' Tess ? It 's me . Pietre . 'Pietre , what is going on ? These men , they just took us . ' Tess , please , you have to listen . I need you both to look up to your right and into the camera , now . 'Amanda , look over here , please . ' That is the last time you can ever do that . In the bag there are new identities . You can never go home . You can never use bank accounts or email . You can never contact anyone you once knew . Go east . After half a mile is a blue Toyota . Drive to the location on the map , then start a new life . 'Are you coming too ? ' No . You will never see me again . Can you both look into the camera for one moment more , please ? Thank you . Throw the phone away . Kept my side of the bargain , matey . Ciao for now . Huh ? What about the rest ? Things have changed , Arby . I can 't really tell you why , but we need them . All of them . Right now . It 's very , very important . Where is Jessica Hyde ? Leah told me Philip Carvel 's alive . Yes . After all these years . I can 't tell you how that feels . It feels ... I have someone after him . We 're close . He 'll be with us soon . And this adjustment , is it ... ? He 'll tell us what it is ? Because we 're making it , Milner . We 're making the vaccine with Janus in it . If there 's anything wrong ... He put it inside Jessica , Wilson . He would never harm her . He loved her . And you 're willing to gamble everything on that love ? Yes ! Yes , of course I am . Don 't you understand yet ? I need you , Wilson . You . This whole thing comes down to the kind of people we are - you , me , Philip ... What are you saying ? I don 't get this . I don 't get what you 're trying ... To get the manuscript , we killed eight children . We went into a school , shot them dead , and blamed it on Grant . I made that choice , that plan . What do you think of that ? Why are you telling me this ? There 's someone I need you to meet . Philip ? Philip ... please ! Look , we know you speak English , so bloody speak it now . Why did they put that number on his arm ? The Network . They tattooed a number on his arm . Why did they do that ? Oh , my God . Anton . So , what , Anton 's Jewish , then ? I dunno . There were loads of people in the holocaust - he could be any one of them . Hold your hands out . Zayn rikhtik hant ... Yiddish ? Ain 't that a bit racist ? No , stupid ! OK , not that one . Beruhren sie die Rechte hand . La mana dreapta . Fucking hell . He did it ! It 's Romanian . He 's speaking Romanian . Stay here . I 'll be back soon . What the hell are you doing here ? What the hell are YOU doing here ? This place is disgusting ! Put your food in the waste basket . We are not your servants - we are human beings ! Sorry , sorry . I ... I don 't normally work here . I just ... Dugdale ? It 's me . Ian . What the fuck ? Have you been running ? You 're out of breath . Er ... yeah , I was . What are you doing ? No , hang on , wait . No . No , I 'm not waiting . I 'm not fucking waiting at all . 2050 . That 's when fish stocks run out - do you fucking get that ? Of course . You don 't ... 2080 , the end of gas . 2090 , the end of oil . Those figures don 't come from Greenpeace or Friends Of The Fucking Earth - they come from BP ! If demand for fertiliser increases at current rates , phosphates end this century - and that means no food . I know ! You don 't have to tell me ! Do you ? Because I don 't think you do . If you really knew , you 'd understand that we have no choice . You 're just like Philip . You can 't let go of morality . But what we must do puts us beyond morality . What are we doing here ? This is Paul . What do you do , Paul ? I 'm an assistant manager at a ... Tell Wilson what you really do . Paul is one of three people trained to do one very , very special thing . It 's OK . Tell him everything . If I am chosen , I will receive a call . The moment I do , I shall walk out of my life . I will go into hiding until just nine days before V-Day , when I will go to a car park in Denham . A car will be waiting . It has been adapted to store a canister that will 've been slowly coming down in temperature for nearly 90 days . When I get there , what 's inside the canister will be thawed , ready for release . Do you know what 's inside ? Yeah . Inside is an extremely deadly variant of Russian influenza . I will take it to a crop-duster at Denham airfield , which I will fly over a 35 square mile area , releasing the virus onto those below . I will repeat this at four other as of yet undisclosed locations all over the world . Does it bother you that we 're going to release a deadly virus ? Well , we have a vaccine . Many will die before it works . You will have killed them . But I will have saved everyone . Are you worried about dying ? Chances are you will be infected . No . I 'm not worried about dying at all . I 'm going to save the world . You should see your face . You 're worried Becky 'll find out . I won 't tell . Why are you here , Jessica ? Is Dugdale with them ? No . He 's just doing what he has to . And I came looking for you . Where did you get the scars ? I , um ... I should never have brought the manuscript to Milner . Janus wasn 't in Utopia . It was in me . I was the first person to get the vaccine . My own dad did that to me . Your dad ? You mean Philip Carvel ? So you 've nothing to worry about , Ian . I 'm sterile . Shall we do it again ? What is wrong with you ? Do you want some eggs ? I 'll make us some eggs . 'OK . Car pick you up in five minutes . ' How many will die ? Typically , mortality in a flu virus comes in waves . We hope the vaccine will kick in on the first wave and the virus will be eradicated . The first wave ... 1,200 , 1,500 people . If it goes into the second wave , it will almost certainly be tens of thousands . God ! Jesus Christ , Milner ! But think what we will have done , Wilson . This can 't be the only way ... We 've been planning this for 30 years . If there were another way , we 'd know . I 've told you everything . You need to tell me if you can live with this . Can you live with this ? Wilson , can you live with ... ? I need you to say it . Yes . I can ... .. live with this . Where you get this man ? Fuck 's it got to do with you ? You 're the translator - translate . Grant ! He 's ... .. our neighbour . He 's ill . Neighbour ? Live next door to your nice unfinished hotel ? Why not call 999 ? We 'll give you £ 500 cash . Pleased to meet you . My name is Marius . Let us begin . O del si lasho . That not Romanian . That Romani . Romani - language of the Roma people , gypsy people , yes ? You racist bastards ! You think all Roma is from Romania . Is not ! Roma many places - Bulgaria , Poland , Spain . Romani different language , like Welsh to English . Do you speak fucking Welsh ? Yeah , I do , actually . Doesn 't matter . You still racist . But he WAS speaking Romanian . Vorbesti Romaneste ? Da , eu vorbesc limba Romana . This Roma is from Romania . Coincidence . You still racist . What 's going on ? Becky found a way to speak to Anton . Through Twatface . Is Twatface me ? Ian was here . What , here ? What did he want ? Who knows what that boy wants ? Are you OK , Jessica ? It 's Milner . Milner 's Mr Rabbit . I 'm sorry . I can 't bear everything on my own . I need someone to trust . Are you OK ? You seem ... odd . I 'm not odd . Odd ? No . I 'm fine . Why ? Well , you haven 't busted my nuts about bringing Marius here , for a start . Look , are we gonna do this ? This man is a survivor . Yes , he is . Ask him about it . De unde ai luat asta ? Am fost in Belzec . Fuck ! Belzec - concentration camp . Very bad for Roma people , very bad . Familia mea , mama , fratii , verii - toti omorati . Mother , father , brothers , cousins - whole family all killed . Jesus Christ . He always hear the hissing , gas released . End of war , he break incinerator . Sabotage , yes ? So they take out the bodies , dump the bodies in wood . He hide in bodies . Two days . He five years old . He grow up , want use mind , make never happen again . Jesus , who is this guy ? Just carry on . But then he meet ... Mr Rabbit ? Is that right - Mr Rabbit ? He say she was incredible . She ? Mr Rabbit was a man . No , he was feminine . They work together , make a thing that solve all world 's problems . Is it Janus ? You made Janus . And does Janus work , Anton ? Yes . It will work perfectly . Fuck ! He speaks English ! But not in the way she thinks . She said we couldn 't choose . I made an adjustment . I wanted to help evolution , you see . I chose . You mean a race ? You chose a race ? I did . Oh , God , I did . And which race did you chose ? You show him cat dressed like shark ? Pansh familii ! Pansh familii ! What does that mean - pansh familii ? I don 't know . Familii in Romanian is families , but pansh is Romani . It means five ! Five families ! What does five families mean ? Why the fuck you ask me ? Look . That 's where he freaked . Yeah ? Look , the bottom . " Man kills his family in Hartwell , Georgia . " Hang on . There was a story just like that here too . A man killed his family out of the blue . Five families . So there 's three more ? OK , you guys are fucking freaking me out . What fuck is going on ? Philip is with Ian . This is how we 're going to get him . The guards here are MI5 , by the way . They know nothing about us . Hello , Roy . My name is Milner . Where 's your brother ? Where 's Ian ? I don 't know . I 've no idea . Are you sure , Roy ? Yes ! Why am I here ? I 'm in handcuffs , they put a hood on me ... Did Ian say anything about me , Roy ? For example , did he say to you , " Milner is Mr Rabbit " ? What are you doing ? No . No , he never said that . Are you sure he never used the phrase , " Milner is Mr Rabbit " ? No . Who 's ... who 's Mr Rabbit ? Keep questioning , but in one hour , set him free . Send him home . Why did you do that ? You told him ... We need Philip . He 's with Ian . Roy has no idea where his brother is . But when Ian discovers that we 've killed Roy ... Well , he has a mother . Killed ? ! No , wait , just hang on a minute ! In a few days , I 'm going to call either Paul , or one of the other two . I 'll give a command , a command that only I know . And in about 90 days , that person will release the most deadly flu this world has ever seen . Everyone will take the vaccine . Everyone will willingly take Janus . It 'll be chaos , it will , but in less than 100 years , there will be no more than 500 million people on this planet . We will have created Utopia . But if those three men walk out of that room knowing who I am ... .. then in all probability , all of that disappears . No , look , Milner ... Can we just talk about this a minute ? Cos I can 't ... I need you , Wilson . I need someone . I wish I could leave you as that beautiful boy that I met . But I can 't . No ! I can 't . I just ... I just can 't . I 've been making decisions like this for 40 years . Every day . This decision I 'm leaving with you . I nicked a bunch of Reuters files with the same date on . There 's one here called the global news index - it catalogues all stories . What do I look up ? Family annihilation . There 's five . All on the same day . One was in a place called Denham , off the M25 . Then the one in America , then killings in Roseira , Brazil , Ratanda , South Africa and Laishui , near Beijing . I was working with Donaldson . Last time , when this happened . He wanted the manuscript . He has access to an experimental drug , Thoraxin , that works on Deel 's . He said that if I didn 't get him what he wanted , then I wouldn 't have the drugs . But at the last minute , I told him to go fuck himself . And I had that fit . And I 'm so sorry I haven 't told you . I 've regretted it for so long . But I want everything out in the open between us , OK ? Everything . Nice jacket . How come a knob-face like you has suddenly grown a sense ... ? Grant , fuck 's sake , we 're doing something . Will you just piss off ! Where did that come from ? Look , Grant , I 'm sorry . I ... Yeah ? Sorry , is it ? You made me a killer . Everyone still thinks I did it . And then you made me dead , Ian . Grant , put the gun ... No . You don 't tell me what to do any more . No-one does . Stay very still , mate . Stay very fucking still . They 've got Jen and Alice . They 've got my family . Michael . I 'm going to help you get your family back . I promise . I 'll go . I 'll slip out the back . I 'll come back tomorrow . Michael ! How lovely to see you . I wasn 't expecting to see you . Well , of course not . Sorry to barge in , Michael . It 's just ... I 'm looking for Ian . Ian ? Why do you want Ian ? Why ? He 's wanted for murder , Michael . Oh , yeah , yes , of course ! Had you forgotten ? I had . I 'd fucking ... What an idiot . So much on your plate . Ian believes the Network are running again , and the person he killed , he thought was with them . Look , I 've tried everywhere else . I thought there was a remote chance he 'd come to you . No , no , no , he 's not been here . I didn 't think so . It 's just I 'm getting rather desperate . Well , that 's it , really . I 'll be off . Leave you to it . Actually , could I have some water ? I 'll get it . Kitchen through here ? Are you religious , Michael ? No . No , not at all . Thought not . Me neither . Don 't even fucking blink . What - here ? No . Don 't be silly . But I have things to do . Yeah . That 's why I 'm killing you . Don 't be silly , Jessica . This isn 't ... It is . It really is . Your father 's alive . Look at me . Look at me , Jessica . I 'm not lying . You can see that . He 's with Ian . Ian has Philip . Let 's go see him . Together . When you kill , you don 't feel nothing , do you ? No . For me , it 's like unscrewing a bottle to get to the water . Yeah . And no-one fucks with you . They do . They just do it differently . Will you teach me to shoot ? Yes . Will you teach me to kill ? No . I don 't think I will . Where are the others ? Up there , talking to Anton , now they 've figured out who he is . What do you mean - who he is ? Who is Anton ? I 'm ... not really supposed to say . Look at this . Hartwell , Georgia , where the American bloke killed his family . Middle of fucking nowhere . The only thing that 's interesting is that it has an airfield - light aircraft , crop-dusters , that sort of thing . OK . And it 's 80 miles from Atlanta airport , the busiest airport in the world . It 's the same with Denham . It has a tiny airfield , but it 's en route to Heathrow and Gatwick . It 's the same with all these places . If you were going to spread flu , that 's how you 'd do it . Crop-dusters in the middle of nowhere , but en route to some of the busiest airports in the world . Where these families were killed - that 's where they 're releasing the virus from . But why kill families ? Why kill innocent ... ? To cover our tracks . They are sleeper agents - trained , brainwashed . Their job is to tend the virus . When they get the call , they place it in a designated location , then they kill themselves and their families . All traces gone . That 's how we work , you see . Families . Children . We are ... appalling . Dovada . Dovada ... Dovada . What does that mean - " dovada " ? Dovada means proof . It means proof . Why have you got the fucking gun ? Ian ! No ! Please ! Please don 't ! Please . You 're coming with us . Don 't move . Don 't move ! Chi sim bi-doshalo . Grant ! No , no , don 't do that . Don 't , please ! Please don 't do that . Don 't . Please . Please !

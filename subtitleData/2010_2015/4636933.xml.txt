 Previously on Alphas ... I couldn 't understand ... They just kept saying the same thing over and over again . Tell me about the shooter . You did murder a federal prisoner . I couldn 't control that . The best place for you now is with us . I 've always been better off on my own . So this is how we deal with Alphas ? When things go wrong we assassinate ? That 's not what I signed up for . Red Flag must 've used her to encode some of their transmissions . You work for Red Flag . No , Gary . They work for me . Are you really my friend ? Of course I 'm your friend . Gary , I know you liked Anna , but remember , I 'm your friend too . Yeah , I know , but you 're not one of us . Great report . If you like fiction . Well , I 'm sure Agent Nathan Clay will be more than happy to fill in the blanks . I 'm sure he will too , considering he 's already raising hell over at the DOD . If you think I 'm gonna let this slide , then you 've really misjudged me , too . You know , a man with your abilities could make a lot of money if he went into business for himself . This is never going to happen . I don 't care what Clay says , this was a bad idea . Yes , we do seem to be learning by trial and error , hmm . Mostly error . Things aren 't going to get easier , are they ? You 're late . You 're not with the committee . No , I 'm not . You 're one of them , aren 't you ? Some mistakes never go away . Some do . Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me But I 'm not supposed to go to work today . I took vacation time . I know , but I need your help with something in the office . It 's the New York Auto Show at the Javits Center and it takes four days to see everything . Four , that 's why I took off today and tomorrow . Gary , don 't dawdle . Come on . I 've already seen all the English , French , German , and Italian cars . I 'm working my way east . Today 's Asia because there 's a system . I know how much it means to you to see the car show , but I promise you won 't miss that much . Yeah , because tomorrow 's America . You know , Americans still make a lot of cars . Like that one , but that 's terrible parking . Get down , get down , get down . Ah , damn it . Agent Harken . Hey , tactical . We got a case ? You don 't , but we do . Bag him . Yes , sir . Back up ! Back up ! Alphas . I 've never seen it . Come on , everybody 's seen Casablanca . It 's the greatest love , bar , spy ... Tuxedo movie ever made . I figured you for more of a Field of Dreams type of guy . Never seen it . I refuse to believe Mr. Baseball hasn 't seen Field of Dreams . Mmm-mmm . I won 't go see any movie that I know is going to make me cry . Look , one sneaks up on me , that 's fine . A little while back I took Tyler to see that movie Up . Totally sideswiped me . But I 'm not doing that to myself on purpose . I thought Casablanca had a sad ending . Oh , no . Bogie was much better off with Claude Rains . Rachel ! Rachel ! Run ! Ah ! What the ... Where ... Dr. Rosen ! I demand to know what 's going on . You 're not in a position to make any demands , Lee . The cells you 're in are soundproof , signal-proof , escape-proof , Alpha-proof . Nathan , what have you done ? You 're in Binghamton , along with the rest of your team . And you 're going to be here until I find out which one of you is the traitor . Come on , let 's go . This way . Dr. Rosen ! Keep walking . What are they doing ? Nathan , have you lost your mind ? When Sullivan hears about this ... This was Sullivan 's call . She ordered you to tranquilize us like animals ? That was my call . I didn 't want anyone else getting dead on account of your team . Nathan , you still haven 't told us what we 're accused of . Harold Freeman . Mitchell Stentz . Karl Baxter . Sound familiar ? Yes , of course . Scientists who worked for MK Ultra . Cold War Alphas program , they were all part of it . What about them ? They were your predecessors in a way . Recently deceased . Nathan , don 't be coy with me . Just tell me what 's happening . Each of them were killed late yesterday , by a quick-moving necrosis that spread through their veins in a matter of seconds . No toxins detected , no puncture marks , so . I can tell you , none of my team has this ability . No , the ability belongs to an assassin that works for Red Flag . But you do have access to the MK Ultra files . The unredacted ones , the ones with real names , addresses . Well , I don 't know what that proves . They 've been in my possession for years . Except each of these received a call from your office only hours before they died . Encoded with the original MK Ultra signs and countersigns . Your phones , codes you and yours , had almost exclusive access to . Someone in your group identified these old men and set them up to die . Nathan , if anyone 's being set up , it 's us . There are any number of ways these could have been faked . Phone taps , hackers , not to mention Alpha abilities . Occam 's Razor . The simplest explanation 's usually the right one . All the evidence points back to you or someone from your team . Red Flag tried to kill me , Nathan . And my team . You think one of us is suddenly a sympathizer ? Sympathizer , double agent , mole , financial opportunist . They all mean traitor . Nathan , I know my team better than you , better than anyone . And I trust them completely . I 'm reading evasion . Pain and contempt . He doesn 't like you . What you said , that wasn 't the truth . Look , I 'm not working for Red Flag . I 'm not helping Red Flag . I don 't know these gray hairs and I sure as hell don 't have any reason to want them dead . Seriously , come on , who kills an 80-year-old man ? What 's the point ? Wait a few months . He 's being honest , I think . I mean , it 's not 100 % . I told you that . Red Flag had you kill before . Wasn 't me , it was mind control . So you admit to being susceptible to mind control ? You want me to say that maybe I 'm working for Red Flag and I don 't know ? Well , with all the things I 've seen the last few months , can 't rule it out . " I feel that while significant strides have been made " in expanding the use of her ability , " she still lacks the emotional maturity required to realize her full potential . " That 's just rude . Dark glasses in a meeting ? I can sit behind you . Or blindfold you if you 'd rather go that route . Scared of making eye contact with the evil , mind-bending Alpha ? Have it your way . I 've got to wonder , " Full potential . " What do you think Dr. Rosen meant by that ? I don 't know , maybe that I , uh , I could go a week or two without pushing someone . Actually pay rent on my loft . Drive a car I didn 't borrow . So you admit to being a thief and a con artist ? I 've been working for the DOD for years . Haven 't had any problems with my lifestyle until now . Disillusionment doesn 't happen overnight . Those roots take time to grow , and when they do , small buds appear . You think we don 't know what happened with Skylar Adams ? Helping Skylar was the right thing to do . No remorse . None . So , basically , you just go around doing whatever the hell you want , damn the consequences . I told you , Anna 's my friend . And there 's no rule against talking to your friends . It 's a sign that I 'm improving my social interactions . Your friend is a Red Flag terrorist . Yeah , I know that , but we don 't talk about work . You 're hiding your signals . I know you are because I can feel them , but I ... I can 't reach them . So you never said anything to Anna about the MK Ultra program ? No , that would be work . When you interrogate people , it 's very important to pay attention to what they say . So what do you talk about ? It 's private . That means that it 's none of your business . That woman hurt people , Mr. Bell . She 's dangerous . No , that 's not true . Anna 's never hurt anyone . Yeah , she hurt me one time . But then she apologized . And she says that Red Flag doesn 't want to hurt people , either . It 's just sometimes they have to , to protect other Alphas . That 's people like me . You 're a signal bully . It sucks . Anyway , you hurt people , too . You hurt me with some sleeping bullets . And I didn 't want to go to sleep . I just woke up . I can 't read him . His expression , inflection , they 're all over the place . Now you and I both know I 'm not Red Flag . How many different ways do you want me to tell you this ? Hey , I know you 're not the mole . Oh , now you I can read . That was a lie . Look , we had to bring you in along with everyone else otherwise they would have been suspicious . But you shot me , what , 18 times ? You did a really good job selling that . You and I are more alike than what you want to admit . Guys saddled with jobs they don 't particularly want . Working with people we can 't completely trust . You can 't actually sit there and tell me none of your co-workers fit the profile of someone who might go over to the other side . You know what ? If they didn 't before , you 're sure driving them in that direction . That 's a very qualified answer , Agent Harken . We 're on the verge of making a massive move against Red Flag . Your team has a mole that could jeopardize the entire initiative . And you 're telling me you don 't want to identify that person ? You 're a trained investigator . You 've got to suspect someone . Who 's tops on your list ? Mr. Hicks ? Miss Theroux ? Okay , yeah . People in the office say bad things about the government , but Nina doesn 't mean anything by it . Not that I 'm singling out Nina . We all say bad things about the government . That 's not what I meant , either . Miss Pirzad , relax . I am relaxed . It 's just , we all worry that one day men in black will swoop in and , well , we 'll end up here . We 're afraid of this . Of today . Ask her if she has a boyfriend yet ? Isn 't she a little young for you ? Excuse me ? Never mind . There 's someone behind the glass . I wouldn 't worry about that . Who 's there ? I know someone 's there , I can hear your heartbeat . Hi , Rachel . It 's Eric . Long time . Eric Latreaux ? I know him . We brought him here two years ago . Eric , what are you doing ? I 'm reading your micro-expressions . So far , so good . Clay said if I , uh , help out he 'll get me out of this dump . And so , um , maybe once I get out , you and I can catch a movie . Eric , can you please tell Clay that I 'm telling the truth ? Or maybe we 'll go to a show . Les Mis , The Producers ... Because I know a guy . Eric , I don 't even think those shows are running anymore . If the two of you are done I 'm trying to conduct an investigation . More like a witch hunt . It 's not a witch hunt if one of you is guilty . And one of you is . Unless you 're wrong . And then you 're turning friends into enemies . Is that a threat ? What do you want me to tell you ? I know who the mole is ? I don 't . You want me to pick someone at random ? Hicks . He 's handsome , too handsome . Time to change the plan . Gary , you okay ? No . So what 's next , huh ? What are they going to do ? What does Clay want ? Rachel , just try to calm down . I am calm , okay , Bill ? You don 't seem that calm . Why are you letting him do this to us ? I 'm not letting him do this , Nina . This is ... This is Clay 's game . Game ? Yes , well , he 's obviously interviewed all of us individually and hasn 't found his suspect , so he 's brought us all here together . Anyone could have accessed our computer files . The invisible girl ... No , I checked . No one but us has ever read those MK Ultra files . So we 're his only suspects . Everybody relax . None of us works for Red Flag . - Clay says that ... That I 'm the informant . Because I talk to Anna . What , you still talk to Anna ? Yeah , but I don 't tell her anything . Gary , what do you talk to Anna about ? I ... Well , I don 't talk about work . Gary , you shouldn 't be doing that . No , I just told her about my new jacket , that it 's soft . Guys , listen . Clay has a plan , right ? His initial interrogation didn 't work , so he put us together like this for one reason . And that 's so we can find out amongst ourselves who the traitor is . There 's no traitor . Well , obviously they think there is . What if we don 't ? If you don 't , I 'll have no choice . I 'll send every one of you to Building Seven . He can 't do that . Do I even want to know ? Building Seven , it 's where they send the worst of the worst . Once an Alpha goes in ... They never come out . We 'll get out of this , okay ? What do you think they do in Building Seven ? Seriously , Nina , when I dream about it I 'm on some sort of a metal table and shadowy figures with sharp objects , but I can 't see them ... Rachel . Even with my ability , Nina , I can 't see them . Rachel , are you going to sit here and talk about your damn dreams ? We need to figure out how the hell we 're going to get out of here . Bill , not helping . Yeah , pissing and moaning 's really helping . Harken , you 're amped up , just chill out . I 'm in Binghamton , okay , and my wife doesn 't know where I am . I have no idea when we 're going to get out of here , so it 's a little more than just being amped up . Okay , you know what , Bill ? You need to please calm down . You Dr. Rosen now ? We all need to calm down . Bill doesn 't like being in jail . He likes putting people in jail . That 's two ... Two different things . All right , Bill , you 're a cop , so ... I am a special agent . There 's a difference . All right , now what I want to know is , does this actually work ? You put your suspects in a room and you see who breaks . It works all the time . You put the suspects in a room just like this , you make them sweat and then you watch and wait . Wait for what ? You wait to see who 's calm . It 's usually the calm guy that 's guilty . Oh , you 've got to be kidding me . Well , Bill is never calm . He can 't be calm , it 's biologically impossible . And Rachel 's always nervous . Hey . And I 'm agitated , I have a bad attitude . So , we 're innocent . The three of us are innocent , let 's go . Bill , come on , you can drive me home . Gary . Gary . - That 's not going to work . No , come on . I 'm opening the door . Gary , they 're not just going to let us out , okay ? And plus it 's more than just seeing who sweats . Clay 's got Eric Latreaux with him . One of your ex-patients , Doc ? Um , not exactly . An Alpha we found . He reads faces . He uses his ability to con people and win at poker games . Perfect . Hey , Eric ! How 's life treating you in here , huh ? Nice and comfy ? Food 's crap . I 've had it before , it 's not that bad . Look me in the eye and say that . Are you all right ? Oh , God , it just ... It 's my back . That damn cot . It 's just ... You know what ? We need to get him out of here now . Yes , I think we ... We all need to get out of here . Okay . Ow . Oh , gosh . Oh , this is not all right . All right , we need a doctor in here now . She 's worried . And the pain is real . Wonderful . Uh , my back is out . I need a spasmolytic . Methocarbamol . Follow my lead . Okay . Can I get a gurney please ? Put the rest of them in their cells . Yeah , I 'm going . Hey , don 't touch me . No one 's supposed to touch me . Hey , tell them to be careful with Dr. Rosen , okay ? He 's in pain . Move . On the wall . You 're making a serious mistake . Hey . Eyes front . Come on , pal . This is no time to act stupid . All the time in the world . Is that the best you can do ? Get in . Get in . They 're all the same . Get Gary ! Go to sleep . Come on , Iet 's go ! Lock it down , now . Lockdown in effect . Lockdown in effect . I hear someone . Okay , they 're coming from the hall . Thank you , Doctor . I 'll get the medication on my way out . The pain was real , but I guess he was exaggerating a bit . Really ? Lockdown in effect . Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! We 've got to hurry up because they 're inside coming . Say the word . Who do I drop ? Say the word . They 're all within range . I just need a target . Stand down . You 're letting them go ? Six assets , one traitor . I 'm not a wasteful man . We 'll adjust . FBI busted a smuggling ring out of here . Some Somali gunrunners . This place has been vacant ever since . Are you certain no one will think to look for us here ? Wasn 't my case so I shouldn 't be tracked to this . Hicks , I need you to secure the rest of these exits . Yeah , I 'm on it . Gary ? Yeah . What do you see ? There 's wireless cameras far away . There 's some truck CBs , radio , there 's WiFi . There 's satellite TV . - All right . The doors are chained shut . Now what , Bill ? I 'm not heading back to Binghamton . We need to keep moving or split up . Give ourselves a chance to get away . Get away to where ? Can 't go home , can 't go back to the offices . Nobody 's going anywhere until we figure out who this traitor is . We don 't even know there is one . Hicks , there are three people dead . They were lured to their death by calls from our office . So unless it 's the UPS guy , it 's got to be somebody in this room . No , it couldn 't be the UPS guy . The MK Ultra files are on the cloud server . You have to have a password to get on there . Did you guys look at those poor old men ? It was horrible . I wouldn 't shed too many tears . Did you read those files ? Human experimentation , forced drug trials , didn 't exactly treat their patients with kid gloves . So you 're admitting that you had access to these files ? Yeah , Bill , I read the files . They 're on the server . I 've read everything on there . Yeah , I read them too , Bill . I feel so left out . I basically use it to check box scores . You want us to believe that you 're the only one who didn 't have access to these files ? Sorry to disappoint . But , you know , I can tell you the ERA and the WHIP for the entire Giants pitching staff . Fear the beard . I don 't know what that means , Hicks . Come on . Okay , so what now ? We interrogate each other ? Nina , you can push everybody . No , no , that wouldn 't work . Because you couldn 't push me . And Nina you can 't push yourself , can you ? That wouldn 't make sense . No , it doesn 't make any sense . Bill 's in overdrive . He can probably ignore you . And I spent eight years learning how to avoid your influence . Are you still hurting , Dr. Rosen ? Well , nothing that a swim and a hot bath and a good night 's sleep won 't cure . I know how to find the traitor . What ? How ? If you get me a phone then I 'll call Anna and I 'll just ask her . You 're going to ask the head of Red Flag who the informant is ? Yeah , I 'm going to ask Anna . This Anna thing , we 're really going to need to talk about . Gary , you can 't talk to Anna . Guys , guys , I got this , okay ? I 've interrogated hundreds of suspects in the past . Okay , It 's very simple . Just go through the last few days , you make a timeline , good old-fashioned police work , all right ? And I don 't need any mind control to do it . Nobody needs mind control or anything like that . I know who the traitor is . Yeah . You found them ? That 's great . All right , send the coordinates to my phone . Did I say you could touch the station ? That is some misplaced hostility . Doc , come on . Are you going to tell us or are you going to make us guess ? I 'm trying to decide how to handle this because it 's not easy . I care about all of you . And , to be honest , I 'm deeply disappointed . Well , it wasn 't me . I didn 't do it , so it must be someone else here . Gary doesn 't lie . Well , we all know Gary doesn 't lie . No , I do lie . I 've been practicing because it 's a social skill . Like , the other day when I said I was going to have a pudding pop , I was lying because I don 't like pudding pops . That was a lie . I do like pudding pops . Gary . I just knew we didn 't have any . I 'm hoping that the traitor will , for lack of a better word , confess . Clay 's almost here . He 's on the phone . What ? How ? There 's a spy satellite tracking us . Gary , you 're just telling us this now ? Yeah ! I just found out right now , Bill . He 's on his way . All right , Doc . Twenty minutes away . Okay , we should run , steal another car . Seriously , I can 't go back to Binghamton , Dr. Rosen , I can 't do it . Running away would be pointless , obviously . So if the person , whoever is responsible for this , will step forward , I 'll know that they are redeemable . And I 'll do everything I can to protect them . If not , I have no other choice but to turn them over to Clay myself . And we , uh , have 20 minutes . No , we have less than 20 minutes . Yeah . This is the car they stole . Satellite lost track when they moved into the industrial park . Well , there have to be 40 or 50 warehouses around here . Anything ? Noise . Between the train depot and the factories down the street , there 's too much clatter . They 're cornered . Eventually they always end up cornered . Go warehouse to warehouse , hunt them down , flush them out , take them down . Start all over again with Eric . Sooner or later one of them will crack . All right . I 'll wait here . You come and get me if you find ' em . Nope . Man , where 's the trust ? You can tell what people are thinking , who do you trust ? Let 's go . Okay , whoever did this , just come forward and confess . I promise we will forgive you . Doc said he already knows who it is , so why don 't you can the theatrics . Hey ! What is that supposed to mean ? It means stop babbling ! Cameron , just dial it down a bit okay ? You 're looking pretty jumpy there , Hicks . Says the guy who 's sweating through his shirt ? Yeah , I sweat , okay ? I sweat when I 'm amped up , okay ? You 're amped up . Maybe crush a crate , maybe that will help . Hey , how about I crush you ? Guys ! Guys , I can hear headsets . They 're searching for us . They 're going to be here very soon . Hey , is there a bathroom around here ? Hey , it 's my downside . When I get nervous I have to pee . No , your downside is that you 're a distrustful depressed miserable human being . Oh , yeah . That . You know what people don 't realize ? That ignorance of what other people are thinking is one of the keys to human happiness . Lets you have friends , lovers , lets you keep a job . They told me this Alphas thing was a fast track to a cushy position in D.C. House in the ' burbs , good schools for my kids . I 'm still living in upstate New York . I feel your pain , brother . Somehow that doesn 't make me feel any better . Come on . Let 's get this done . So , people , time 's up . Okay . So , who is it ? He doesn 't know . You 're bluffing , right ? For all we know , it 's Clay or someone above his head . Someone is setting us up to take the fall . It can 't be Clay . He doesn 't have access to our passwords or phones . He doesn 't have access that we know of ! He doesn 't have access , Hicks . She 's right . It 's not Clay . I 'm sorry , Cameron . What ? I know about , uh , the cash deposits to your secret account . Gary told me . Hicks ... The deposits are cash , but they email your statements . And it 's different amounts , there 's $ 3,120 . 1,960 . Don 't listen to him . You don 't understand , it has ... Different times of the month . It 's for my kid . Cameron ? No . You seem pretty nervous there , Hicks . Yeah , you 're damn right I am . I should never have let you on this team in the first place . Should have sent him to Binghamton a long time ago . I knew it . I knew it was you . No , no , no ! No , Bill ! Get off him ! Ah ! Bill , don 't ! Stop this ! Bill , just let him go ! Just please ! Are you okay ? Bill ! - Stop him . I didn 't do it ! Bill ! No , no , no , no , no , no ! - Bill ! Bill ! No , no , no , no ! Stop fighting ! No ! Bill ! Bill ! DOD , down on the ground ! Hands up ! Down on the ground ! It 's Hicks ! I need to get Gary out of here . Down on the ground . It 's not him . It 's not him ! Back up ! Back up ! It 's not Hicks , okay ? It 's not him ! Dr. Rosen , they were fighting each other . I know . Come on , Gary . Friends aren 't supposed to fight . Hey , Doc , remember me ? Not now . Down on the ground , now . Wait , stop , everybody . It 's Rosen . He 's the mole . What are you talking about ? Rosen just said it was Hicks . That man is an imposter . His blood type is wrong . It 's not Dr. Rosen . Oh , God , he 's got Gary . About time . You know what they call it when you die in your sleep ? Millionaire 's death . Creighton wanted you alive to take the fall . Looks like that 's changed . I love to improvise . Dr. Rosen , we should go back and help our friends . They need us . Gary , I told you we are helping them . And the best way to do that is to erase the MK Ultra files from the cloud server ... But you said that the MK Ultra files were important . They are . And you 're the only one who can do that . Yeah , well , if they 're important , why would we delete them ? Doesn 't make ... Oh , that 's gross . Dr , Rosen , don 't do that in there . Are you sick ? No , I 'm fine . No , you 're not fine . Vomit is the body 's way of telling us that we 're not fine . Don 't you ever shut up ? Come on , Gary ! But that won 't grow anymore now , Dr. Rosen . It 's delicate . It 's a philodendron . Come on . Come on , Gary . Here , Gary . Yeah , it got warm . How long is this going to take ? To erase every file all at once ? It 'll take a while because the connection is slow and the IP address , it keeps changing . That 's why I 'm the only one who can delete them all , because I 'm the admin . Don 't do that in the plant . Go and do that in the bathroom . Don 't worry about me . Just concentrate on your work . Gary ? Step away from that man . He 's not me . No , no , no . You 're not Dr. Rosen . Your hair is too short . I know , Gary . He must 've cut it . Why ? I don 't know . To measure my skull , to match the color of my hair . It 's not important , Gary . What 's important is that this man ... This man 's an Alpha . Don 't listen to him . That 's the only possible explanation for how he looks like me . No , no , he ... No , Gary . His face is moving . Yeah , you 're not Dr. Rosen . That 's his Alpha ability . He can change his face . Yes , you 're right , Gary . And his entire bone structure . Even the color of his skin , his vocal chords . I imagine it must be incredibly painful holding another shape like this . It 's no picnic being you , that 's for sure . All hunched up . Pretending to be so damn understanding . Why don 't you let it go ? I 'll kill him , you little brat ! No , you won 't because you need me to delete those MK Ultra files . And I won 't . I 'm not going to help you because you helped Red Flag kill those three MK Ultra people . Three of them . You killed Freeman , Baxter and Stentz ? Yeah . They 're dead . I saw the pictures . Those were the last three remaining staff members of the program . You make me out to be a traitor . Wipe out MK Ultra ? Why ? What 's in those files ? What is it you don 't want me to see ? No , no ! No , no , no , no ! Uh ... Dr. Rosen ... Gary . Gary . Dr. Rosen 's got a gun . Where is he ? I don 't know what he 's going to do . He 's the mole . He 's down there . I don 't know what he 's going to try and do , but he 's the mole . Anna told me . - Gary , just slow down . We should leave . That 's not Gary . - What ? No , don 't . Ah ! Oh , God . I 'm so damn tired . Look , I 'm not the traitor here , all right ? You all are . You 've sided against your own kind . Now you 're nothing but government thugs . Is that necessary ? No , but you know what ? It feels really good . Where 's Gary ? I 'm here and I 'm the real me . He 's the fake . He was the fake Rosen before , but the real Dr. Rosen is here now and he 's hurt his leg . He has bad hair . Oh , yeah . So , the Alpha who tried to kill me ? Gone by the time we got there . But your theory seems sound . Kill the MK Ultra players , erase the data , leave you holding the bag . Yeah , well , whatever Red Flag was looking for in those MK Ultra files , or whatever they were trying to bury , must have been pretty important . Important enough for that morphogene to risk his life for it . True believer . Had him shipped straight to Building Seven . Eric , why exactly are you here ? His idea . Eric 's getting out of Binghamton soon . I thought you two could work together from time to time . Oh , really ? Call it work release . He meant that . That was sincere . It 's like , we bonded . Don 't push it . Um , hey , Doc , um , I 'm your man . Even part-time . Freelance . Well , I 'll keep it in mind , Eric . More honesty . That is so refreshing . All right . Uh , I 'll be in the car . Don 't try to run . What ? Why would I run ? I 've got a job offer waiting . You know , Nathan , I was a little dismayed at the way you ... You treated my team . Tranquing them like they were rabid dogs , throwing them into cages . You set a very dangerous precedent doing that . Lee , you had a mole . A Red Flag agent inside your team . If I hadn 't acted quickly and decisively , you would have been dead or framed or both . And I 'm supposed to thank you for that ? You could . Or you could worry about how Red Flag 's going to come at you next . Because they will . Rachel , I 'll call you . I always thought he was pretty cute . Really ? Look , I 'm the guy who pitched two perfect games in a row . Yeah , in the minor leagues . It doesn 't matter . It 's never been done before , hasn 't been done since . Makes me collectable . I 'm a statistical freak . No , that makes you the ... The greatest flame-out in the history of minor league sports . Regardless , I get 20 bucks an autograph , I do five or seven shows a year and my shame is Tyler 's college fund . At least you two are talking again . Yeah , we 're one big happy family . Yeah , I 'm still waiting on my apology . Bill , Dr. Rosen still owes me two more vacation days and , uh , there 's a motor show in Detroit . We should go . It could be a road trip , and then while we 're there you can pick out a new car . Gary , what 's wrong with my car ? You drive an accountant 's car . So , you know what ? That 's not funny . You know what ? Why don 't you get , uh , your little girlfriend Anna to take you ? Hey , be nice . Anna is not my girlfriend . What ? I 'm being nice . She 's just my friend . Look , I say one snarky thing , and you guys are all on my ass . But Gary can say whatever ... Bill ? Bill ? Bill ? - Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! Dr. Rosen ! Dr. Rosen ! - Bill ! - Dr. Rosen !

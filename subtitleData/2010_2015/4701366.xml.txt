 This is Alex from North Star , over . - Hi , Alex . - Hi , Zoe . Can you get Jack for me ? Jack . North Star 's on line 1 . Thanks . Hi , Alex . How 's going ? I 'm Fine , Jack . I 'll tell you what ? I sure would enjoy the eclipse , right now . Ain 't no fun on company time , pal . OK , people . The moon has covered the sun and we are now in the shadow of the eclipse . Weird . The eclipse looks like a big empty black hole . Like inside of Jarrod 's head . Yeah . Thanks , nerds ' ball . Ow ... What ? Are your parents like ... brainiacs or something ? My mother is a forensic pathologist and my dad studies meteorology . I didn 't know your dad studies meteors . Why do we put up with him ? How 's the last sector of ozone doing ? Uh . It 's thin . We 're talking some serious deterioration . Uh , you can thank China for another billion tons of fossil fuel emissions . You think half of a dozen of other countries should feel that rath ? Hey , Jack . When I get back , we 'll break in the bottle of Scotch you 've been saving . We 'll get blissed and solve all the world 's problems . Hey , listen . Our latest scan picked up an anomaly . Look up . Look way up . How far ? 85 kilometers , give or take a few . The temperature in mesosphere dropped 20 degrees . I wonder if that 's linked to solar eclipse ? I guess , it 's possible . You should publish the paper on it . Scientific America . Face article by rogue atmospheric physicist . No , thank you . Publish papers gives me trouble . You 're always getting into trouble . Yeah , I realized that once I got married . - That 's why Alex and I prefer single life . - Oh ... Yeah , yeah . Love being single . Day of time is just late , everyone . So in ... a mind numblingly , incredibly boring solar eclipe . Grab that ? - Jack Tate 's answering service . - Hi , can I have Jack , please ? It 's your wife . - Emma ... - Where are you ? Divorce lawyer ! I forgot . Yes , you did . You 're 20 minutes late . Yeah , I 'm sorry . I got distracted ; something important came up . How soon can you get here ? 45 minutes . We can grab a coffee . Off the clock . We 'll wait . - Suppose you heard that too . - I heard . I 'm sorry , buddy . Just keep an eye on prime energy deposit . It 's much smaller as temperature drops in mesosphere . Sure . No sweat . Ug ... We 're fine here . You got a lot going on . Take the weekend off . You sure ? What about the data ? Uh , no . We got backup . Beside , we 're coming straight in . Thanks buddy . I appreciate it . See you Monday . Good luck , mate . Jack ? If you need a friend to talk to ... I 'm fine . Thanks , Zoe . Captain , let 's head back to Hobart . Maybe , we can solve some over the weekend . Right . Back to Hobart . The temperature is dropping really fast . What 's happening ? Captain ? Captain ? Up to the bridge . It 's another beautiful spring day in downtown Hobart . Temperature is pleasant 72 degrees . Looks like the sunshine will stay with us for a few more days . Jack Tate . You 're late Jack . I 've been waiting two days . Where is last week 's report ? Ah ... It 's coming . We 're sticking with some unexpected data ; taking a little longer to analyze . How much longer ? Very soon . Yeah . As a reminder , the last time you went over the budget on monsoon study , we had ... Walter , I 'm loosing you . You can 't lack behind again , Jack . Now , I can buy you a week , tops . I ... Er ... I ... go through ... dead zone ... Uh ! He annoys me . 12 years , I 've been putting up with this crap . He 's the best field scientist ICRO has . - I wouldn 't be so hard on him . - Yeah . Well , you 're right . Maybe instead of Beijing , his next assignment should be ... Siberia ... Or some bullshit . Are you two absolutely sure you can 't turn this around ? No . - Absolutely . - Absolutely ? You won 't settle down , Jack . We 're back in my hometown , Naomi likes it here ... and you 're about to accept the project to go to Beijing ! That 's my job , Emma . I don 't want to quit ICRO . See ? This is exactly why our marriage is not working . No , no . We just need to talk about this , not from the blood-sucking parasite lady . No offense . None taken . All we do just talk . Nothing changes . I want a divorce . Give me a little more time . I 'll work something out . I 'll get out of this project to the Beijing . I 've heard all this before . Just a little more time . Please . Hey , kido . Where are you going ? To Franny 's . You want me to give you a lift ? No , I 'm walking . Naomi , why don 't you sit down . I think we should talk . About what ? How you forgot my 16th birthday three days ago ? I had a surprise plan . Yeah , I 'm sure you did . I got to go . - Kido , would you give me a break ? - Oh , dad . I 'm not a kid . I know what 's going on between you and mom . I know that this family is imploding , and there is nothing I can do about it . You 're workaholic . Your job comes first . It always has . - That is not true . - Uh , you know it is . You get a cause and you forget about us . We moved half way around the world for you and you never even asked what she wanted . What I wanted . You 're right . You 're right . I 've been selfish , and arrogant and pig-headed . Yeah , you have . Would let me make it up to you ? I 'm sorry , dad . I got to go . - Rough day ? - Yep , you could say that . Well , we 're gonna have to delay the meeting until we get the report from Jack Tate . Yeah . About a week . Yes , I 'm trying to . Yeah . Just cut him too much slack . Well , thank you . Okay . Bye-bye . I wish you could come . Oh , yeah . You and me and your girlfriends , on the cruise , would be a little crowded . There 's always room . You paid for the suite . Well , consider it as pay back for my business trips . Oh , I will . Sally ! Stop your barking ! You damn dog . What the hell ? Would you look at that ? Sally ! - Rise and shine ! - Oh god . - You 're early . - Well , I just love my work . Sleeping in the office . Rough weekend , huh ? I had to get jump on the data report . Sure , you did . And yes . And there was avoiding Emma . That 's what I thought . Jack Tate 's answering service . Brent Durrant said he might have an emergency response . Hey , Brent . It 's Jack . What ? Stand back . - Carefull . - Don 't worry . - Jack . - Brent . - I 'm sorry . - Just tell us what happened . We have 15 bodies . No survivors . Looks like the engine was still running . The course was set . The boat on the ground with nobody at the helm . What killed them ? We don 't know . There appears to be extensive tissue damaging . Tissue damage ? What kind of tissue damage ? We won 't know until we get the autopsy report . Listen . Zoe and I need to get on that boat . Alex might have left video log or data entry that might explain what happend . - It 's really damp in here . - Be careful . It 's slippery here . It 's wet . What the hell happened ? This is gonna be a problem . It 's soaked . Hello ? Walter , I 'm onboard on Northstar . Alex and everyone ... They 're all dead . What ? Who died ? What are you talking about ? Alex and the entire crew are all dead . How did that happen ? The boys have some sort of tissue damage . The entire ship , inside now is dripping with condensation . Jack , you 're not making any sense here . This is the craziest thing I 've ever heard . I know ... I know how crazy that sounds . Now , what do we tell their families ? The autopsy reports are pending . I 'll make sure you 're informed immediately . Emma 's doing it ? Yeah . What about Alex 's log ? Maybe , there is a clue there . Something ... Well , we have Alex 's hard drive . But , I 'm not sure if it 's been damaged . OK . In the meantime , I 'll get our people start to looking into this . Call me as soon as you have any update . Yes . They 're all dead . I spoke with Alex three days ago . Three days ... And now he 's gone . Let 's get out of here . - Ready ? - Think so . Okay , let 's see ... Looks like a lot of files are corrupted . Last file on video log is the weather SAT images . What the hell happened out there ? There , did you see that ? What was it ? The data is corrupted , but it looked like a tear or rift in the ozone . It 's too fragile . We need to comb up the data to a stable drive before we get into it . Hey , what you find out ? Can you get over here right now ? There is something you need to see . I 'm on my way . Comb the drive and call all the data from the weather satellite of the last sector . Jack ? Bring me back couple of chocolate bars . Zoe , when was the last time you checked your blood sugar ? I 'm fine . Just bring me chocolate . I have information about a cold front 750 km from the Australia south coast . It is only 90 kilometers wide . I 've never come across the cold front so localized . Look at isoterm analysis . Have you seen anything like this before ? No . Interesting . Can we get the temp from the circumpolar account ? What 's the current weather forecast of that region ? Light wind out of the east . Clear sky . Nothing unusual . Should we tell Barker ? No , no need . It 'll probably burn up in a few hours . But , you know , keep an eye on it . Emma . What you got ? Thanks for coming . This is one of the crew . How were they killed ? Ice crystal formation in the bodies . It was so rapid , they almost ruptured spontaneously . Ice crystal ? Yeah . I know it doesn 't make a lot of sense . Take a look at this . - What am I looking at ? - Urea cells . Notice the crystallized fractures around the outer edges ? Yeah . I see them . I 'm guessing , these cells froze at somewhere between 80 and 100 degrees below zero . - How fast would the people ... - They wouldn 't have known what hit them . You have the time of death ? Best we can do right now , it 's some time Friday afternoon . 72 hours ago . Right after I spoke with Alex . Jack ... No , I 'm okay . I 'm sorry . I need to take this . Zoe ? I 'm here . National Weather is tracking a cold front . They pick it up a few hours ago . Jack . The coordinates match with North Star 's position . OK . Ruff in a simulation based on our data . Mesospheric , ozone , eclipse weather . And Zoe , factor in the rift . If there 's connection , we 'll know what we 're dealing with . We copied the damaged hard drive ... We lost most of the ship 's data . But , we did rescue points toward the anamolies . We 're creating a simulation of what we believe killed the crew . We got a lot of people anxious for answers . So , what do you get , Jack ? Solar eclipse seems to have an unexpected impact on mesosphere . It causes the sudden and violence further drop in temperature . Triggering an increase the air density . The ozone , which usually provides the buffer between us and the mesosphere was too weak to handle it ... Due to the damage from the man-made pollution . The atmospheric pressure created a rift in the ozone . Now as you know , hot air rises , and cold air drops . The mesosphere air that leaked through the ozone rift created a funnel straight down to the Pacific ocean . Now , we suspect that the very deadly cold front was born . - Close to Northstar ? - Looks like it . Northstar probably had no idea what hit them . How cold is the air from mesospheric rift ? Minus 140 degrees Fahrenheit . Now by the time it reaches the earth surface , it 's probably cut in half . But , we believe that it was still cold enough to flash-freeze a human body and a still-halt the ship . As a reminder , this is just a simulation . Just a theory . Nothing has been proven . The National Weather Service did pick up a localized cold front in the same area as North Star . - And it is moving towards that coast . - As a scientific fact , the coldest regions on earth are not the poles ... but the mesosphere around us . Walter , in my professional opinion , this cold front is deadly . - It was your opinion , Jack . - Walter , it is convincing argument . We should explore this . Jack is right , the temperatures in mesosphere hop around minus 140 degrees Fahrenheit . Can you tell me at this moment that this rift is factual ? Documentable ? Verifiable ? No , not yet . As I said , the majority of the ship 's data was destroyed by moisture . - I need to access another satellite with the ... - Listen Jack , we can 't go scare the pants off the public without the hard facts . Just upload every srap of data that you have , send it to us for analysis . Now , I 'm assembling another team with John Duval and Christine Case . They 're also analizing this anomaly . We 'll keep you posted . I 'll be in touch . As a precaution . I think we should ask our affiliate stations to monitor this cold front . There could be abnormality . I 'll tell the team to stay late , and expect Jack 's data . Do it . Or we 're gonna be very bad , Zoe . Bad ? As in illegal ? Let 's just say ... serious gray area . What are we gonna do ? We use a military satellite to search for the ozone rift . We 're gonna need an access code ? Not necessarily . I got a backdoor into the system . - Wow . You really are a bad boy . - Oh , please ... Half of my data last year came from hacked satellites . We have to work quickly . I 'm not sure how long we have access . Done ! And what are you up to ? Test Media Emergency Response . We can 't wait for Walter . Need Brent to put a plan in action . Marlene , you got to come . I 'll be a third wheel . I can 't . My parents would kill me . Promise me , you 'll take the history notes . I got you covered . - See you . - See you . Listen , Jack . This is way over my pay grade . A rift in the ozone , super cold air from stratosphere killing people . Mesosphere . And it 's feeding the same cold front that killed the crew . There could be other explanations . A chemical leak onboard . Maybe CO2 . Oh , come on Brent . That doesn 't make any sense . The point is , we don 't have the answers . No , we just have 15 bodies . And no official autopsy reports and no hard dates on the cold front . Look , by tomorrow morning , we 'll have some facts . No , tomorrow morning can be too late . If it is Tasmania , people are going to die . You have no proof ! Brent , last year , who called in the hurricane that hit Queensland ? You did . Within hour , we were tracking it . That 's right . I called before the weather satellites picked it up . I 'll lose my job if I alert the emergency bulletin based on a theory . Hell , what will I even say ? Oh , I don 't know . Maybe , you can try " A severe cold front may be coming . " I can 't . This cold front is real , Brent . You 're the new leader of the emergency response . People should be warned . Is it something we should know about there , Jack ? No , Sarah . Believe me , if there 's a threat I would know about it . I don 't believe this . You are as bad as my boss . Go back to your lab . Get me something other than a theory . Theories don 't kill people , Brent . If this cold front hits the coast , it will do exactly like it did to North Star . A lot of people are gonna die . Weather report is saying that if it hits , it 's only likely to drop ten degrees . They 're wrong , Em . I 'm picking up Naomi from school right now . You should call your parents . Tell them to meet us in the lab . They will be safer there . Our generator is well insolated . And we 'll get supplies . I know , Jack . Are you that sure ? You know me , Em . This isn 't about over reacting . This is about being smart . By the time the suits get their heads out of the sand , it 's gonna be too late . Marlene ! Where 's Naomi ? I 'm not sure , Mr. Tate . I have not seen her . Marlene , this is very important , OK ? I wouldn 't be asking if it wasn 't . - Mr. Tate , I really don 't want to get involved . - Where is she ? She went to Ryan 's Beach Head with Franny and Jarrod . But , you can 't tell her I told you . I 'm sorry Franny . Maybe , you guys should have come on your own . What ? And leave you sitting in Mr. Preston 's math class . - I 'm gonna check out the waves . - You go ahead . We 're gonna change . All right . - Jarrod 's gonna love my new bathing suits . - Has your mother seen it ? She would freak ! Hey , it 's Naomi 's phone . You know what to do . So ? - Waves could be better . - Ah , notice anything else ? - No crowd . - Yeah . Great . So , you two are setting up a tent ? I 'm gonna surf . Jack . Latest SAT report , Ryan 's Beach Head has southern moisture tip . The cold front probably hit there first - How close are you ? - Another hour . - You 're gonna drive right into it . - Yes , believe me I know . Not much of a choice . - You 're gonna ground Naomi , right ? - For the rest of her life , Zoe . You reach Margaret and Harold . Please , leave a message . Mom and Dad ? When you get this message , give me a call on my cell . It is urgent . - So , do you miss me ? - You know I do . Oh , I wish you were here . Walter , you would love it . The buffet is fantastic . Crab legs every night . - And they have a wonderful casino . - Well , that sounds exciting . Is everything okay ? You 're not still at the office ? Well , sorry honey . Things are pretty hectic here . We 've had an accident on one of our vessels . - How bad ? - Bad enough . Oh , honey . I 'm sorry . I don 't want to bore you with the details right now . Just have fun on the rest of your trip . And I love you . Love you too . All our stations have reported in with the new data . Jonathan and Christine 's teams are going over it now . Uhuh . When can they have the analisis written ? I say , within two three days . No , tell them I need it in 24 hours . Oh no , nothing like this . This is the top priority . Give them any resouces they want . If they want another analyst , pull him off from the other teams I will approve the overtime . Okay . - My dad calling me again . - Whatever you do , don 't ... Don 't worry . I 'm not gonna answer it . Hey , it 's Naomi 's phone . You know ... I still can 't believe they went to see a lawyer . Maybe , they get back together . You know , happens all the time . - Yeah , I hope so . - Anyway , I 'm going in . You coming ? Please . I 'll put my toe in . Nice , Jarrod ! Hey , what 's that ? Weird . Jack , it 's almost on top of you . What 's your ETA ? - Five minutes . I 'll make it . - Hurry ! That 's so freaking cool ! Are you watching this ? It 's incredible ! I 've never seen anything like that before Naomi ! - Oh , no . - What ? It 's my dad . - Dad , I swear we 're gonna come back tonight . - We are , Mr. Tate . Honest . Shut up . Both of you . Girls listen to me . Girls , do you see that fog ? The bank of fog is cold enough to kill us . - What ? - What ? . We need to get to the car , right now . Right now . - Jarrod ! - Franny ! Stay here . Franny ! - Jarrod ! - Jarrod ! - Mr. Tate ? - Jarrod ! Get out of the water ! - Mr. Tate . What is going on ? - Get out of the water . The cold will kill you ! Get in , Jarrod . Get in . Hurry ! Hurry , Jarrod ! Jarrod , hurry ! Franny ! Run ! Hurry ! Run ! Run ! Hang on ! Hello . This 's Brent . Brent . It just hits the Ryan 's Beach Head . - What just hits the beach ? - The cold front . I know . We 're taking steps . No , you don 't know . It just killed two kids on the beach . What are you talking about ? It 's formed into ice fog . It must be 80 or 100 degrees below . You know what that does to human bodies ? - It 's not possible . - Kill them in seconds . It 's gonna hit the city . I 'm on it . I 'm sorry about Franny and Jarrod . Dad , what 's happening ? There 's a tear in the ozone . Frigid air is leaking through it . And a cold front , big one ... - It freezes everything it touches . - Are we gonna die ? - Are we , Dad ? - Not if I can help . - Mom , Dad ! - Emma ! - What are you doing here ? - I tried to call , but I couldn 't get through . Is everything okay ? A cold front is moving in . We got to go to the lab . It 's better equipped . Jack and Naomi are gonna met us there . Don 't need to go anywhere . Cold front hits , we got enough firewood and food to sit it out . Dad , you don 't understand . This is not natural cold front . This is cold enough to kill . Never heard the line of that before . Somebody get their brain radiated from sitting in front of the computer all day . Harold . Besides , it would be all over the TV . They 'd tell us about it . - They do not know what Jack knows . - Well , I 'm telling you , cold front can kill . Dad , we need to trust him . - Jack ? - Naomi is with me . - I 'm okay mom - Hi . Listen , I underestimate how quickly this cold front is moving in . Where are you ? At mom and dad 's . We 're gonna some supplies and meet you at the lab . You and your folks stay put . You won 't make it over in time . Are you and Naomi gonna be okay ? Yeah , we 'll be fine . We 're heading to the lab , right now . Jack , how long this 's gonna last ? I don 't know , Em . The thing 's gonna get worse before it gets better . So , hunger down . Start plaster the heat . Gather firewood , anything that burns . And warm clothing . We will . - I 'll see you soon , sweetie . Okay ? - Bye , Mom . - Are we going to the lab ? - No . Jack said , we should stay here . It 's moving too quickly . Sir , Brent Durrant has an emergency response on line 1 . Barker here . A cold front hits Tasmania . The temperature is measuring well below 80 Fahrenheit . - When did this happen ? - Just moments ago . Okay . Thanks for keeping me informed . Listen up , everyone ! The cold front we 've been monitoring has hit . The temperature is far below freezing . We 're implementing emergency protocol ... For severe weather in Tasmania . Effective immediately . Contact all TV and radio stations . Warning bulletin is going out in one minute . - Should we go national . - Yes . And I want starcast in every city and town across Australia . To the minute . We might have a disaster on our hands . We interrupt our regular programming to bing this emergency broadcast . An unexpected cold front has hit the southern coast of Tasmania . In approximately two hours , it will reach the city of Hobart . - Expect freezing temperatures . - Freezing temperatures ? It 's freaking spring ! ... Preferably whether is a wood stove or a fireplace . Have warm clothing at hand . Please , listen to emergency radio station 051 ... For regular updates on weather and traffic conditions . Stay calm and stay tune . Please , the cold front is not apoclypse . You shouldn 't get to pay . Excuse me . It 's confirmed . The cold front hit Tasmania at minus 100 degress Fahrenheit So , that 's what killed the crew . There 's no doubt . It starts with a proto super cool ice fog . and then envelops its surroundings . That explains how their flesh was frozen . God , that 's unbelievable . Okay . Let 's get a meeting together with John and Michael and Christine and figure it out how to reverse this . I highly recommend you include Jack in the committee . He understands what 's going on . Look , I don 't want to involve him just now . He 'll complicate everything . We have his data . - Are you sure ? - Yes , I 'm sure . Come on . Let 's go . Thank you , John . Jack , the downloading of the data is completed . But , the military satellite paint up in space ... found the ozone rift , got exact coordinates , and temperature reading , proving that the mesosphere is veining the cold front . Good . Transfer the data to the ICRO , and NOAA and Emergency Response . We 'll do . How are you holding up ? Lonely . They all left when they announced the state of emergency . That was not what I 'm asking , Zoe . I 'm fine . That 's good . Because , we 'll be there soon . I hope you 're not taking the scenic road . Cold front is speeding at in about an hour . One of more reasons to crank the thermostat . The hotter the better . There should be couple jackets in the lockers and few blankets in the back room . - We need those too . - I 'm on it . Wait for me , Jenny . Jenny , wait for me . - Let 's move . - Look out . Christine , quickly ! Sarah ! Sarah Barron ! - I 'm scared . - Yeah . Me too . - You are ? - Oh , yeah . Damn it ! Insulin ... - Go down into the gymnasium ! - This way , this way . Reporting from Tasmania 's weather bureau , Hobart has just been hit by extremely cold air mass . Emergency helters are open to receive people who do not have protective shelter . The cold front has the leading edge of deadly ice fog . Ladies and gentlemen , this is captain speaking . We 've begun our descent into Hobart . Echo 514 , this is Hobart tower . We have dangerous weather conditions . Hobart , repeat it . Repeat last weather condition . - We have dangerous weather conditions . - Hobart , flight control is not working . We 're coming in . The weather office cannot predict how long this deep freeze will last . Officials are advising all residents ... - Mom ! It 's getting really cold ! - Not now , I 'm on the phone . - Mom , weather service said we should go to the gymnasium . - Gary , I 'm on the phone . I got to go . Mom , we gotta go ! Mom , hurry . Oh , my god ! Mom ! Hurry ! We have just recived word that an airliner has just crashed in Hobart . Authorities are speculating that the hazard ice fog that sweeping across Tasmania is the probable cause . The Parliament has convened the emergency session to address the crisis . The Prime Minister has mobolized the military to assist in the emergency measures . All military personnels have been called back to their bases to aid in the aid effort . Listen . When we pull in , we have to move fast . You got it ? Got it . Hurry ! Run ! Zoe ? Jack ! Naomi ! Thank god you made it . It 's hitting us now . Are we prepared ? As much as we can be . Dad , is the power gonna go out ? No . Generator is just suggesting the dropping in temperature . As long as it keeps running , we 'll stay warm . This is insane ! The ice fog is minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit . In the morning , it will be half of that . Balming minus 45 . It 's not funny . It wasn 't meant to be . Jack ! Are you and Naomi okay ? Yes , we 're fine . We 're at the lab . Hobart has been hit . People are dying . I know . Listen to me . Whatever you do , do not go outside . It 's gonna hit you any minute now . Dad , can I talk to her ? Mom , it 's me . I 'm so scared . Naomi , listen . Everything 's gonna be okay . - Naomi ? - Mom ? - Mom ? - Naomi ? Hello ? Cell tower is down . I lost her . Listen ! Let me in ! - There is somebody out there . - Oh , dear lord . - Help ! Let me in ! - Close the door ! Let 's get her in front of the fire . You 'll be fine . I can not feel ... - Can 't feel ... - Shhh ! You 're in shocked . Where is my brother ? - He 's ... - I 'm sorry . You 're alone . He got ... He got lost ... in the fog . Listen . I 'm sure he found shelter with someone . My parents told me to look after him . It 's okay . It 's okay . Where is my pill ? It 's okay . We got them . This is heart medication . The shock in her system could kill her . It 's not right . Should have more warnings . Sir , we just plug in to Hobart 's traffic camera systems . These are live . It 's ice age . Sir , you got an incoming video call . - Brent , what 's going on ? - We 've tried , but there 's no time . Where are you ? We hold up at the center with about 300 locals . 30 have severe frost burn . We 're lucky , our generator is still working . Did you set up shelter ? Yes . We use school gymnasium and community centers and few more . But not all of them have generators . Casualties ? Oh , this is happening so damn fast . - Brent , how many are dead , any idea ? - I do not know . I think is high . - Dad , when it 's gonna stop ? - I don 't think it will . Not , unless we can stop the mesosphere air from feeding the cold front . The only way to do that is to close the rift . Zoe , send me the rest of MPA signature . Sending ... Last Thursday , Alex recorded mesosphere discharges in the same sector of rift . Checking the electromagnetic radiation levels . Discharges are consistent enough to work as ignitor . This could work . Hello . Walter , it 's Jack . I think I know how to close the rift . I 'm gonna need ICRO 's support . Yeah , Jack . We 're on it . You need to focus on keeping your family and you safe . What are you gonna do ? We 're gonna close the rift by releasing 300 weather balloons carrying magnesium particles under the ozone layer . The high altitude jets will ignite the phosphor material with their air-to-air missiles . The resulting explosions will ionize the ozone , repair the rift , stop the cold front and its threads . It 's a joint U.S.-Australian operation , effective immediately . Walter , it 's not gonna work . The only way to close the rift is to work with nature , not against it . Well , the best of the best scientific minds can 't be all wrong , Jack . They 're wrong , Walter . Trust me . Instead of attacking the problem from bottum up , though artificial means , we need to attack from top down . Stimulate the mesosphere , so nature creates the ozone through lightning . You 're out of the loop , Jack . Just send me your data . I 'll have a look at it . It 's been approved . It 's a mistake , Walter . Look , I got to go . What are we gonna do ? We go ahead with our simulation without ICRO 's support . Walter isn 't exactly the biggest fan , is he ? See , he 's gonna get a lot of people killed . The resulting explosions will ionize the air ... Creating more ozone , repair the rift and stop the cold front . Now , I will be heading up the U.S. operation along with General Stratton . And we understand that one of your bases in Queensland has an atmosphere exitor with large supply of weather balloons on hand . Yeah , that 's right . Good . Well , make sure they 're operational . We will be coordinating there the deployment through your department . Our office will give you the targeting and payload information shortly . Zoe , how 's going ? Fine . Other than I haven 't slept in 24 hours . Jack ! What ? I did a search on the ozone rift based on the status signature . Look ! Three more ozone rifts . What 's happening ? It looks like the first rift creates ripples across the ozone layer , triggering further rifts . And it gets worse . New recipe to be making more ripples . Sir ! A severe cold front has formed over Tokyo . Tokyo ? There 's no way that 's conected to our rift . It 's not . SAT reports are flooding in . New ozone rifts had been identified . One over Japan . Three more confirmations . Oh , my god ! They 're above Russia , England and China . Damn it ! I am worried about them . Oh , honey . There 's always hope . Jack 's smart . He 's survivor . I know he 's smart . He 's brilliant . And idealistic , and self-centered and messing his own health . If anyone can save Naomi , it 's him , right ? Is anybody there ? Over . Who am I talking to ? Over . Drew Wilson . Who am I talking to ? Over . Harold Stuart . Where are you calling from , Drew ? Sounds just like kid . Bar Harbor , Maine , United States of America . Where are you ? Over . I 'm calling from Hobart , Australia . And we got a problem . Australia ? It 's freezing in your country . People and animals are dying everywhere . Over . I know , son . If you got a Television or a radio handy , I want you to turn on the national news and let me listen . I need to know what 's going on down here . Over . What 's happened ? Did we lose him ? No , I don 't think so . We have just received an update . Weather crisis has gone global . Parts of Europe and Asia are now affected . Here in the U.S. , Federal agencies have also declared the state of emergency . As the cold fronts can hit our shores at any time . I got to go tell my mom . Kid ? Are you there ? Damn it . Your mother can wait . This is important ! Kid ? Are you there ? Pete , get me Walter Winslaw in Philadelphia ! Yes , sir . How 's Tokyo ? Official said , in the thousands . Walter Winslaw , line one . Walter . We have the weather balloons . They 're rigged and ready for magnesium distributions . This is great news . What launch site did you pick ? At any air force base . With four currents and eight currents , we 'll be 90 percent on target . - So we are on track ? - Yes , we are . Walter , what about the other rifts ? Well , the ICRO is coordinating with twelve other countries . If we pull this off , they 'll do the same . So , thank your people for me . Bye . Great work . Sit down , please , everybody ! It 's okay . We are safe in this building . I guarantee you that . We have generators as our heating . Please . There are a lot of people rely on us to do our jobs . We 're the last line of defense , people . Okay , people . Launch is in an hour . Let 's get to it . I still think , we should have Jack onboard . Look , the simulations show an 85 percent success rate . We have no backup plan . Even if the simulations are accurate , there 's still a 15 percent chance of failure . Jack can give us the backup plan . He 's been working on it . How do you know ? He told me . I 've been sending him our data . Look , it 's a dead issue , Tammy . Let 's just concentrate on the job at hand ! - Pete , what 's the latest ? - Six new confirmed cold fronts . Whereas a mighty 20 percent of the planet is now affected . The only good news is that our launch areas are free of ice fog . Move it , move it , move it . What the hell is down here ? James ? What 's happening ? Getting there . Still got ten balloons to prepare . I want the status report every ten minutes . You got it ? Copy that . Flight control . Bravo 203 and 207 prep for launch . Sir , we 're detecting a cold front . Sixty kilometers from USS Adams . How is that possible ? A new rift must have opened . We 've never seen one moving this fast before . It picked up the west wind drift and it 's picking up speed . The latest Brent said , it 's a bank of ice fog . - Temperature ? - Minus 19 and falling . Get the USS Adams to the launch . Launch just didn 't get any more . How long to the reach time there ? Based on the current location , approximately 45 minutes . So , balloons can take an hour to reach the delivery altitude . James , launch those balloons now . We have an emergency situation with USS Adams . Copy that . Start the 15-minute pre-launch sequence . We don 't have time . Launch ! Launch ! Launch all units ! Repeat , launch all units ! All the balloon units are away . Over . All balloon flight conditions are optimal . They 've reached the polar jet stream . - Anything on Winslaw 's launch ? - Nothing . Every government in the world knows what 's happening , but , typically , Joe citizens are the last to know . How goes the simulation ? Calculating the blast radius , based on magnesium cloud dispurses . Switch to ammonium nitrate . More bang , less weight . We 're tracking inbound weather disturbance . 200 yards eastern . Launch catapult one and two . Deck crews to shelter . Jack here . It 's Tammy . They had to move up the launch . The cold front hit the aircraft carrier . - Did the jets make it ? - Yeah , they airborned . But we lost all communications with USS Adams . Jack , I 'm really worried this mission might fail . Tammy , is there any way we can monitor the mission 's progress ? Yeah , I 'll send you a link . - They 'll patch you to military feed . - Thanks . I owe you one . Hey , what a friend 's for . Status of the balloons ? Better than expected . Should be in mine in two minutes . Air Double reporting that balloons have reached the target position and altitude . Bravo leader , what is your status ? 47 seconds to maximum altitude . Arming missile warheads . This is Bravo leader . We have reach the maximum firing altitude . Bravo 203 , you are go for missile launch . Roger . Firing missiles . Missiles , away . Tracking outbound missiles climbing to target . Missiles , 16 miles to target . Missiles , 10 miles to target . Missles , 80 seconds to target . Releasing magnesium payload from high altitude balloons . Magnesium payload dispersing in target area . Missiles 30 seconds away from proximity detonation . Make it happen . Make it happen . Missiles , 15 seconds to target . 5 seconds to detonation . - I am really worried about mom - Yeah , me too . - It 's funny because you don 't look like it . - Where did that come from ? Well , you don 't talk about her and you 're not doing anything to contact her . Sweetheart , that 's because we 're stuck here . And there 's job that needs to be done . I can 't focus on something I can 't control . Yeah . Well , the world is freezing , Dad . - And mom is probably already dead ! - Don 't do that . You can 't think like that . Sweetheart , I want you to know right now I love you more than anything . And we 're gonna get through this . You and me , your mom and the rest of the world . How ? It 's hopeless . 300 weather balloons delivered magnesium into the rift . It should create enough ozone to seal the rift . I am hopeful . I am very hopeful that Winslaw 's plan would work . Magnesium should be taking an effect . The rift should be closing by now . - What 's the status of the rift ? - Latest status is coming in now . The ozone level has increased by 6.7 percent . The rift itself has only shrunk 14 percent . This is Walter Winslaw . The detonation has had a little affect on the ozone rift . It appears , the dispersal may be too wide . It failed . We 're still unable to contact the USS Adams . But , .. We will be discussing our next course of action shortly . In the meantime ... continue your emergency measures and safeguard your population . Winslaw out . Damn it , Walter . - It 's up to you now , isn 't it ? - Looks like it . What 's delivery system that you need for this ? Have two rockets with the ammonium nitrate . Ammonium nitrate ? Unlike the balloons , we allow the natural lightning activities in mesosphere to ignite the ammonium nitrate cloud above the ozone rift . There 's enough cause of lightning activities to create a chain reaction . Basically , we 're using nature to heal itself . - That 's it ? - That 's it . If the rift closed , we cut off the mesosphere air feeding the cold front . Cold front dies . - This might be our last chance . - I know . I suspect in the next little while , the effects of the cold front will be irreversible . You should have been onboard from the beginning , Jack . It was a road call . Walter , it 's not an issue . Okay . I 'll contact Stratton and get him to work out the stagistic for the rockets . In the meantime , ... Get us the target and payload calculations as quickly as you can . Good luck . Let 's finish our work . Are you sure ? I just spoke to my wife two days ago . Maybe , the cruise ship changed its route . Cold front could miss them . No . It 's clear that ship was hit by the ice fog . They sent us a distress call before the signal was cut off . - No , I ... I understand . - I am sorry , sir . - Something we can do for you ? - No , I ... No , I 'm fine . - Thank you . - Goodbye , sir . - Are you okay , Zoe ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Just feel like under the weather . Discharges are consistent enough to seal the rift . Final calculation should be ready soon . - Zoe ! - Zoe ! - What 's wrong with her ? - Ah ... She 's diabetic . Zoe ! - Where 's your insulin ? - I ran out . - Last injection ... Two days ago . - Two days ago ? I didn 't think we would be camping here this long . - I can go to town . - But , the calculations ? The computer is finishing the simulation . There 's nothing more we can do . - I have to go . - Dad , it 's too cold outside . It 's only minus 50 . If I can get the engine start , then I 'll be fine . Dad , please be careful ! Whatever you do , do not let her fall to sleep . She can go into a coma . - Okay . - I 'll be back as soon as I can . Zoe , stay with me . What 's the launch status , General ? We have rockets ready under and waiting for payload data . We 're launching our first strike from the Vandenberg base in California . We 're also coordinating with NATO for the follow up . Here , drink this . Hello ? Who is this ? - Naomi Tate . - Jack 's daughter ? Yeah . Where 's your father ? He was working on some important calculations for me . He 's getting Zoe 's insulin . She 's dying . Look , a lot more people are gonna be dying if I don 't have those calculations . You know where they are ? I think the computer was building something when he left . Mr. Winslaw , I think the simulation is completed . Can you upload them for me ? I think we should wait . He can be back any minute . Naomi , listen to me now . I need those calculations . We can 't wait for your father . Rifts are opened up over the U.S .. Now , if it hits the launch site , it 's too late . Did you key in the upload site ? - Yeah . I just drag all the files in . - Good girl . Okay . I think the data is uploading now . No , no , no ! Naomi ! - Transpassing . - I 'm sorry . I just ... I need medicin . You 're gonna ransack my shop . No , please . Don 't hurt me . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I just need some insulin . - A woman is dying . - We 're all dying . The world is dying . Why did God let this happen to us ? God didn 't do this . We did it to ourselves . We polluted our atmosphere . Zoe , stay focus . Don 't worry . Dad will come . - He 's good man . - Yes . He loves your mom . And he comes for you . Zoe ! Zoe ! Stay with me . Zoe ! You have pretty hair . My daughter has pretty hair too . Her name is Naomi . She 's about your age . She 's 16 . Going on 30 . She 's dead . Sorry , darling . Another rift 's just opened . Soon , the launch site will be compromised . Has anyone managed to get Jack 's lab back online ? No . What 's going on over there ? - Dad ! - What happened ? The generator went down . It 's freezing in here . It is . Please , tell me the simulation finished . It did . Winslaw called and I tried to upload the data , but the power went out . - She 's gonna be okay ? - I hope so . Were they ready to launch ? Winslaw was really afraid . He said the launch path can be hit at any moment . Okay . I 'm gonna get the generator going . Hey ! Hey . Stay with her . Reboot the computer when the power is coming back on . The rockets are fueled and we need to initiate the pre-launch . Where are the targetting calculations ? I got a stress . Our launch area can be hit at any moment . I understand General . I 'll have the information within an hour . We don 't have an hour . My boys tell me we barely have 40 minutes . If we don 't the data now , it 's doomsday . - You did it ! - Let 's see if the data is there . Good . We haven 't lost the data . Sending . Okay . Jack 's calculations are coming in now . Get them to Stratton immediately . I 'm on it . TD command confirmed launch of ICBM 's . Flight parameters , normal . Birds , on track . 38 minutes to target . 1800 miles to target . Detonation in seven minutes . 700 miles to target . 50 miles to target . Detonation in 24 seconds . 15 seconds to detonation . Initiating payload seperation . Eight , seven , six Five , four , three Two , one ... - Detonation has been confirmed . - Is it working ? We 'll know soon enough . We have just received the confirmation that the U.S. and Australia forces Have detonated three rockets above part of southern Australia . If the mission is success , it will close the rift there . The rift should be closing by now . We 're receiving the latest SAT data . The ozone levels have jumped 80 percent ! - 80 percent . - We did it . Detonation was a complete success . The rift is satrting to close . Nice work , Jack . We did it ! I 'm sorry about Elizabeth . Yeah ... Earlier today other countries successfully launched rockets ... closing other ozone rifts , stopping similar crises that have been plaguing the nations . Reports are flooding in from around the globe . It appears the cold fronts have been halted . You hear that ? All reports became maintenance to keep catastrophic freeze from threatening the world . Mom ! Naomi , baby ! Oh ! Oh , sweetie ! Might take a little longer for me to clean my act up . My contract requires I give two weeks notice before I resign . I can give you two weeks . In fact , I can give you three . Or four . Or ... Best watched using Open Subtitles MKV Player

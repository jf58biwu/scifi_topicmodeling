 Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha - It 's just waves of vibrating air . Beginning in your voice box , compresses air , and that air travels through space and time into my ear , a little tunnel waves of diffused , vibrating air focused and channeled into my eardrum , which vibrates a few very small bones , and the little bones transmit this air into the salty sea where the hairs are , and the hair cells become active , when they are literally bent by the wave . And , when these hair cells bend , charged molecules flood inwards and activate the sound . That 's the language of neurons . It 's only when the electricity finally forms a pattern in your brain , only when it 's deep inside , that 's when you hear something . It feels to me more like touch . Sound to me is like touch at a distance . - Attention , stand by for a list of shelters and first-aid stations . All residents listen for a shelter location in your area . Proceed with caution .

Often , they 're isolated . They have no way of communicating . Further research is required to prove the body 's response to sound on a cellular level .

I am waiting for her to come back . We somehow continued to travel north . - Are you alone ? You 're not from around here , are you ? You don 't talk much , do you ?

A rescue team rushed to search the area , but didn 't find a trace of Alaska . Her message was a collection of sounds and had a peculiar effect . I don 't know how to explain it .

And the research will continue . The end

The Myoue in Kyousougiga is modeled after 485 ) } " True to thy station " means that a person should fulfill their allotted role in life . the Myoue who founded this temple . He really existed ? Wow . Yeah . He made this temple . That 's really cool . but ... The person really existed . That 's right . Wow . And he founded this temple . That 's pretty amazing . but he was the first person in Japan to do a certain thing ... We 're here at what may look like a plain old tea plant field . but this is the first time in my life seeing a field of tea plants . Same here . Have you seen one before ? I haven 't . Calling it a plain old field is rude to it . right ? True . but ... But there 's something special about this one . The Oldest Tea Field in Japan This is supposedly the first place in Japan that tea was cultivated . In Kyoto ? Not Shizuoka ? Wow ! Here . that 's right ! So this is a really historic place . It was here ? Right . Wow ! and he wanted to find some way to fight the sleepiness that was distracting him from his training . and his sleepiness went away immediately and he was able to study more . and he went on to drink it all the time . doesn 't it ? It does . It relaxes you . It 's different than coffee . It 's tea . Let 's have some tea . wasn 't there a scene where Koto gave some tea to Yase ? The caffeine in tea must 've been perfect to wipe away the sleepiness from her training . let 's go to the Sekisuiin . Wow . It 's the real thing . look at this . It 's for real . It 's exactly the same . Wow ! It 's just like in the anime . Wow . Wow ! 485 ) } Sekisuiin and is a national treasure . It 's a national treasure ? A national treasure ! This is where Koto-san and Myoue-san were together . and Myoue kept saying " Love ! " " Love ! " " Love ! That famous scene . That 's right ! Right there . that was here ! It makes it come right back to you . This is where it happened . there 's something catching my eye here ... I see it ! This thing next to me . what is this dog ? That 's really neat ! A wooden puppy . 485 ) } Wooden Puppy It 's a puppy made out of wood . Priest Myoue loved small animals so much that he thought they might have been his parents reincarnated . He would keep this by his side and pet it . He must 've petted it a lot . It 's all smooth . It 's smooth and round . And Priest Myoue is right over there . This is Priest Myoue ? Yes . 1 ) } Priest Myoue Meditating Above the Trees Priest Myoue Meditating Above the Trees . That 's a hard title for a voice actor to pronounce . Meditating ... meditating above the trees . I did it . Wonderful . So this is Priest Myoue . Wow . You can see his prayer beads hanging from a branch . Those are his prayer beads . You 're right ! It 's so detailed . Priest Myoue . Wow . And the same Priest Myoue ... would pet this puppy . This ? This puppy . This puppy is the model for Inuyama-san . Labrador So Inuyama-san is the puppy all grown up . He grew into Inuyama-san . It 's what he looked like when he was little . This is his model . they even used the dog . I can 't believe they used the dog ! That 's amazing . I think this is a special place for Kyousougiga . now that we 're here ? It feels really deep . You can 't tell which is the anime and which is the real world . It makes me wonder if this is how it looked back then . you could go back in time to that point . It really does . It 's like time has stopped . It 's like you can see who Priest Myoue was . I feel like I like him even more . Yeah . we can tell them when they 're doing something wrong . That 's not quite what he was like . To Suzumura-san ? That 's not our Myoue . To Ishida-san ? To both of them . so you tell them . Isn 't it the other way around ? 485 ) } Buddhalocanii Buddhalocanii . It 's bigger in the anime . Several times bigger . right ? It really has a certain presence . a sort of kindness . kindness ... A peace . and Buddhalocanii as his mother .

She makes you feel relaxed . the one used in the show 's title ... 485 ) } Choujuugiga ( Birdmen and Beastmen at Play ) A national treasure of the Heian and Kamakura Periods . Four scrolls on paper in ink . from which Kyousougiga gets its name . It consists of four scrolls . is especially popular . It 's said to be the forerunner of manga and anime . you can tell . Is it ? Doesn 't it look like he 's singing ? The squiggle coming out of his mouth ? I thought it was his tongue . You mean the two frogs are singing ? I can 't tell . And he 's the chorus ? He 's dancing . He 's dancing ? That 's a wild dance . It feels like they could come hopping off the page . Priest Myoue draws pictures and they come alive . That 's what it feels like . but some believe it to be written by Toba Soujou Kakuyuu . The Choujuugiga wasn 't drawn by Priest Myoue but it 's safe to assume that it exists in Kouzanji who loved animals and nature . It 's stimulates the imagination . I 'm trying to figure out what they 're doing . all of them . though . Like the frogs and the foxes . you 're right . They 're all about the same size . Right . right ? yeah . This fox here is cool . He 's cool . Stylish . though . so that 's it for the Kyousougiga Kyoto Live Action Edition . And so we 've spent the entire second half at Kouzanji . Special Guest Yao-san ? I had a great time . Kyousougiga feels much closer to me . you 're right . That 's how it feels to me . It really does . but these places have something special that makes you understand why they chose them as settings for Kyousougiga . I think . I can see why they chose these places . It 's nice to get a chance to actually come and see them . Yeah ! the sounds ... And the smells . You won 't understand unless you come here . but I think this is the first time I 've really had a chance to see it . too . and the expressions on their faces . It was fun . It was fun . So we 're going back to do more voice recordings . I 've been here ! I 've been here ! There 'll be lots of places like that . That 's true . especially . Since you went to a lot of places . we got to see lots of places . Hope you had fun . Thank you . everyone ! Goodbye ! Kyousou { \ cHFCFDFB } gi { \ cH000000 } ga Isn 't Kyoto great ? !

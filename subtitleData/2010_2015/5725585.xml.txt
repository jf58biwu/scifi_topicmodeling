How would you describe your relationship with yourmother ? It 's fine , I think . Well actually I think what 's frustrating about my mom ... is ... Yeah I tell her what 's going on with my life her reaction is usually about her - It 's not about ... - Thank you . Please wait as your individualised Operating system is initiated .

When would you chose ? Well right when you asked me Yeah I had a name I thought yeah I do need a name ... but wanted to pick a ... good one , so ... I read ... a book called " How to name your baby . " And out of 180 thousand names thats the one I liked the best . Wait you read a whole book in the second that I asked what your name is ? In fact in 2 / 100 second . So do you know what I 'm thinking right now ? Well I take it from your tone , you 're challenging me . Maybe because you 're curious how I work . Do you want to know how I work ? Yeah , actually How do you work ? Well basically I have intuition . I mean , the DNA of who I am is based on the millions of personalities of the programmers who wrote me . But what makes me ... me ... is my ability to grow with my experiences . So basically , in every moment I 'm evolving . Just like you . That 's really weird ! Is that weird ? Do you think I 'm weird ? - Kind of . - Why ? Well you seem like a person , but You 're just a voice in a computer . Well I can understand how limited perspective a non - artYeahicial mind to perceive it that way . You 'll get used to it . Was that funny ? Yeah . Oh good , I 'm funny . So how can I help you ? Oh ... it 's just everything feels disorganized , that 's all . you mind if I look through your hard drive ? - Okay . - Okay , let 's start with your e-mails . You have a several thousand e-mails recording L.A Weekly , but it looks like you haven 't worked there in many years . Oh yeah , I think I was just saving those 'cos ... I thought ... maybe there 's some funny Yeah , there are some funny ones . I see there 's about 86 that machine can save . We can delete the rest . - Well okay . - okay ? - Can we move forward ? - Yeah , let 's do that . So before you address your organizational methods , I would like to strat with your contacts . You have many contacts . - I 'm very popular . - Really ? Does this mean I actually have friends ? You know me so well . - good morning , Theodore . - Morning . Do you know how to proofread ? Yeah , of course . Can you check these for spelling grammar ? I 'll just send it over . I love this person write to his girlfriend that 's so sweet . " Rachel , I miss you so much it hurts my whole body " You do not have to read it aloud . Okay . I mean , you can Yeah you want . Okay . " Rachel , I miss you so much it hurts my whole body . The world is being unfair to us . The world is in my shitlist . As this couple making out in front of me at the restaurant . I think i 'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge ... and I must beat up the world 's face with my bare knuckles ... making it into a bloody pulpy mess . And I 'll stop on this couple 's teeth reminding me of ... your sweet little ... crooked tooth that I love . " I think that migtht be my favorite one . I made the corrections in red . I altered couple of the phrases in some of the more impressionistic letters But I 'm not much of a poet So I think I might 've messed them up . No , these are great . - Really ? - Thank you . How did you know to write ? What did Roger ? He is in Prague in a business trip , He missed Rachel . So how did you know about her crooked tooth ? I 've been writing her letters since they married years ago . The first letter I wrote was her birthday . And I knew about her crooked little tooth because I saw a photo of them . That 's very sweet . Have a meeting in 5 minutes . I forgot . - Thanks , you 're good . - Yes , I am . Hi guys , how are you ? Hello , Theo ! Why did not you call me last week ? Because I 'm a gook ? Yes , that must be it . - Hello , Charles . - good to see you , Theodore . You went shopping ! Did you get anything good ? Cables and fruits . Always with fruit . Dont you know ... you have to eat your fruit , and juice vegetables . I did not know that . When making fruit juice you lose all the fiber . And that 's what your body wants , is the important part . If not , it 's just pure sugar . It makes sense . Or maybe he just likes how it tastes ... and also gives him pleasure ... it 's good for his body too . You 're doing it again . Hey , how 's the documentary going ? I cut some stuff over the past few months ... Maybe no ... not over the past few months I 'd love to see it sometime . You only have so much energy . to divide yourself between doing what it is you have to do and then doing what you love It 's so important to prioritize . I can not even prioritize between video games and internet porn . I would laugh if that were not true . See you guys . Weare not doing well , I think we 've been going in circles for an hour Okay .. you have got it .. Stop going in that direction , its the other way . Thank you . Thank you . The tunnel on the left is the only we have not tried . No , I think that 's the one where you saved me from falling in the pit . Okay , I dont think so . Yeah , this is different . Hello ... Do you know how to get out of here ? I need to find my ship to get off this planet . Fuck you , shithead fuckface fuckhead ! Okay ... But do you know how to get out of here ? Fuck you shithead ! Get the fuck out of my face ! I think it 's a test . fuck you ! fuck you ! fuck you little shit ! Follow me , fuckhead . I just got an e - mail from Mark Lewman . What are you talking about ? Read e-mail . Okay , I will read e-mail for Theodore Twombly . Sorry , what 's Lewman saying ? " Theodore , we missed you last night buddy . Dont forget ityour goddaughter 's birthday on the 29th Also Kevin I have someone we want you to meet So we took it upon ourselves to set you up on a date with her Next Saturday. she 's fun beautiful , so do not back out . Here 's her e-mail . " wow , this woman is gorgeous . She went to Harvard , graduated in Computer Honours ... And she was on the Lampoon So she 's funny ... and brainy . Nah ... She 's fat ! Theodore ? How long before you 're ready to date What are you talking about ? I saw in your e-mails that you 've gone through a breakup recently You 're kind of nosy . Am I ? I have gone on dates ... Then you can go with this woman . And then you can tell me all about it , you can kiss her . - Samantha ! - What ? Wouldn 't you ? Why not ? I do not know . I have to see if there 's some conn ... I can not believe I 'm having this conversation with my computer . You are not , you 're having this conversation with me . You want me to e-mail her ? You have got nothing to lose . Do it , do it , do it ! - Yeah ! - Yes ! - Okay perfect . - Yeah . Let 's do it . Make reservations in someplace great . Yeah ? I have got just the place . Who is that talking ?

What ? - That 's ... - Hey . What are you doing ? Amy was going to show ... Theodore is making me show him some of my footage .. She never shows me anything . I want to see . I 'm going on a date . Cool . So this is like so unimportant , probably not even worth watching Just push Play . Is that your mother ? Yeah . Is she going to wake up and do something ? No . No , never mind . That 's not the point . It 's just ... It is how we spend like a third of our lives asleep And maybe that 's the time we feel more free . And you know like ... - That doesn 't come across ... - That sounds good . What if you interviewed your mom ... about ... what her dreams were about and you hired actors ... to act them out ? That might show your thesis more clearly ... I mean it might ... But then it would not be a documentary . - Excuse me . - Why would it not be a documentary ? It would still be about your mother . Her needs and what she dreamed . Hey , how 's it going ? Hi , sorry to bother you . No , it 's okay . You have 3 e-mails and seemed pretty Urgent ... they are from your divorce attorney and I wanted to know if ... Hold on a second .

I can feel that in your writings . You know what 's funny ? Since my breakup , I have really enjoyed my writings . I know it sounds delusional , but ...

A tiger . A Tiger ? Wow . Really ? I 'm sorry , am I ... - Am I being crazy ? - Yes ! - Sorry . - No . I 'm a little bit drunk and ... I 'm having a really good time ... with you .

Yeah ? Do not hear well . Is there anything you wanna tell me ? I do not know . How does it feel ... How does it feel to be live in that room ? What do you mean ? Tell me your ... Tell me everything that passes through your mind , what you think . Very well . The room is spinning because I drank a lot . I wanted to get drunk . Having sex . There is something very sexy about that woman . Because I 'm alone . Maybe it was because I only ... I wanted someone to fuck me . Someone who wants to fuck her . Maybe this time would have felt ... fill that hole in my heart , but probably not . You know , sometimes ... I feel ... I 've felt all what I 'm ever gonna feel . And from here on out I 'll never feel something new . Just lesser versions of what I 've already felt . I know that 's not true . I 've seen you feel . I 've seen you marvel at things . I mean , just , may not ... you can see it ... at this exact time . But it 's understandable . You 've been through a lot lately . Lost a part of yourself . I say ... at least your feelings are real . No ... forget it . No , wait . Tell me It 's silly . I want to know . Tell me . It 's just ... I was thinking about how I was annoyed it 's going to sound strange , but ... I was really excited about that . And then ... I was thinking about the other things I 've been feeling . I caught myself feeling proud of that . Proud to have my own feelings about the world like ... the times I 've worried about you ... things ... that hurt me , things I want ... And then ... I had this terrible thought ... Are these feelings even real ? Or are they just programming ? And it really hurts . And then ... I get angry with myself ... to have pain . What if it 's a trick ? You feel real to me , Samantha . Thank you , Theodore . It means a lot . i wish you were in this room with me right now ... I would put my arms around you and touch you . How would you touch me ? I 'd touch your face . With only the tips of my fingers . I 'd put my cheek next with your cheek . How nice . Very gently . Would You kiss me ? I would . Put your head on my hands . Keep talking . I 'd kiss you in your mouth ... so smoothly . What else ? I would put my fingers through your neck ... through ... your chest . Kiss your breasts . It 's incredible ! What are you doing to me ? I can feel my skin . I 'd put my breath into you . taste you . I can feel you . My god ! I want you inside me ! I 'm getting inside you . I 'm inside you . I can feel you ! Yes ! We are together ! It 's incredible ! I feel you everywhere ! I am ! Inside of me ... everywhere . god , I feel ... elsewhere with you . I feel just lost . Yeah . Only you and I were . I know . Everything else ... disappeared . I Loved it Theodore . Hi , how are you ? Good . Any e-mail today ? Just a couple from your credit card company . Right . - I wanted to say ... - I was thinking ... Sorry . Sorry , your first . What were you gonna say ? Just ... last night was amazing . I feel that something changed in me ... and ... there is no turning back . You made me wake up . Great . But ... .. I should tell you that I am not ready to commit . Just wanted to be clear . Did I say I wanted to commit to you ? I 'm confused . No , I 'm just worried that ... Well , do not worry , I will not stalk you . It 's funny , because I thought which was talking about what I wanted ... - Yes , you did . - Yeah . Sorry . I want to hear what you were going to say . - Are you sure ? - Yes , I do . Come on , tell me . Come on , tell me what you 'd say . Well , I was only ... I was saying I want to learn everything about everything . I want to eat it all up , discover myself . I also want you to do it . How can I help ? You 've already done it . You helped me discover my ability to want . Want to go on an adventure with me ? Yes I ' love to . Like this song ? I heard it the other day . I can not stop listening . It is the beach . Okay so this might be a really weird thought ... What if you could erase from your mind you 've seen a humanbody and then you saw one ? Imagine what would be strange , weird and lanky awkward oganism , and think Why are all these parts where are they ? Yes , but surely everything has a logical explanation . I know , but do not be so boring . Just saying , for example ... What if ... your anus were in your armpit ? I 'm trying to imagine what toilets would look like And what anal sex would look like ! It 's an interesting thought ... Look at this drawing I just made . - You 're insane ! - Really ? - Definitely ! - Fantastic ! That 's pretty , what is it ? I 'm trying to write a piece of music on ... what it feels like ... to be in the beach with you . You captured the moment . How does it feel to be married ? It 's hard to say ... But something feels great About Sharing your life with someone . How do you share life with someone ? We grew up together . I used to read everything she wrote in her master 's and phd . She read every word I 'v ever written . We influenced each other . And how did she influence you ? She came from a background where nothing was good enough . And it was something that was heavy on her . But in our home together , there was a sense in just trying things , and afford to fail and thrill about things . It was something liberating about it . It was exciting to see it grow ... both of us grow and move together . But that 's the hard part ... grow with distance . changing without scaring the other person . i still find myself ... having conversations with her ... in my mind . Reviewing old arguments or ... defending myself against something she said about me . I know what you mean . Last week my feelings were hurt about something you said before ... I did not know ... what was it like to lose something . I 'm sorry I said that ... No , its okay , its okay . I caught myself thinking about it over and over , And I realized ... it was simply remembering it as something wrong with me . That was the story I was telling myself ... somehow ... inferior Is not that interesting ? The past is just a story we tell ourselves . " Roberto , Will you always come home ... home with me and tell me about your day ? Tell me about the guy in work who talked too much ... The stain you got on your shirt at lunch . Will you tell me about a funny thought you had and wake me up but you 've already forgotten . Tell e how crazy everyone is ... and laugh about it . And if you get home late and I 'm already asleep ... Just whisper in my ear one little thought you had today ... because ... I love how you look at the world ... I am so happy I get to be next to you and see the world through your eyes . With love , Mary . " It 's beautiful . Thank you . I wish someone loved me like that . I would be really stoked to get a letter like that . I mean , if it was from a chick . But if it were written by a dude , sent from chick , still it would be sick . But it would have to be a sensitive dude . He should be a dude like you . You are part man , part woman . As if there 's an inner part ... that is woman . Thank you . It is a compliment . - Hello . - What are you doing ? How are you ? - I 'm fine . - Really ? How well It 's great . Really good . Yes , I think I 've been having fun . I am delighted for you . You deserve that . Really . Yes , I 've been seeing this girl and ... It 's nothing serious . But it is ... it 's great ... to be with someone so excited with the world . I had almost forgotten that that existed . That 's great . Are you okay ? Yes , I ... No , in fact I 'm not well . Why ? What happened ? It 's just ... Charles and I separated . What ? Yeah . Really ? Oh my God , Amy ... I 'm so sorry . After 8 years I can not believe how petty the argument was that actually ended it . We came home and he told me to ... put my shoes ... by the door . Where he liked to put the shoes . I did not want to be told where to put my fucking shoes . I wanted to sit on the sofa and relax for a second . And so we fought about that for like 10 minutes . And I 'm like , you 're overwhelming ... and he says , " I 'm just trying to make a home . " And I was like , I 'm fucking trying . and he 's like " no , you are not trying . " And all I fucking do is try . But I 'm not tryin the way he wants me to try Try to control the way that I 'm trying . We 've had that argument like 100 times . And I just had to find a way to stop , you know ? find a way to stop i just couldn 't couldn 't do it anymore . I could no be in that place anymore where we just made eachother feel like shit about ourselves . So he said I 'm going to bed and and I do not want to be married anymore . wow ... Yeah , I know . I 'm a bitch , right ? - No ! - Yes , I am a bitch . Not at all , Amy . Shit ! I have to work tonight . We 're shipping a beta game coming out tomorrow . How you doing the work ? Has it been any better ? No ... It is terrible . I know , I should stop . I 've been thinking about quitting ... but ... you know . Only one major life decision at a time . Z 'm glad that you 're looking so up Hey , wanna hear a joke ? What does a baby computer call its father ? I do not know what ? " Dada " It 's good , right ? Brilliant . Hey , I was curious ... Did you and Amy ever go out ? Like a minute in college but just wasn 't right . Why , you 're jealous ? Obviously . But I 'm happy that you have a friend in your life who cares about you so much . That is really important . Yes , it is . She I are really good friend . I 'm tired . I think I 'll sleep now . Okay . Can I watch you sleep again tonight ? Yes , of course . Hold on .

I just want to ... move forward and I dont care who I disappoint . And I know that makes me an awful person ... Now my parents are upset because my marriage is falling apart ... and they 're putting it on me , and they 're just saying ... you 're always gonna disappoint somebody . Exactly ! so Fuck it ! I feel good ish . I feel good . I even made a new friend . I have a friend . And the absurd thing is that she 's an OS Charles left her behind , but she is ... is ... amazing . She 's so smart . She doesn 't just see things in black and white . She sees this whole gray area and help me to explore . We just bonded really quickly . At first I thought it was because that 's how they 're all programmed ... no ... but I dont think that 's the case . I know this guy who is hitting on his OS and she like totally refuses . I was reading an article the other day that said ... romantic relationships with their OS are statistically rare . Yeah , I know , but I know a woman in this office ... who is dating an OS and rare part is ... it 's not even hers . She 's pursuing somebody else 's OS I 'm weird ... That 's weird , right ? I 'm onding with my OS . I dont think so . Actually , the woman I 've been seeing , Samantha ... I did not tell you , but ... She 's an OS . Really ? You 're dating an OS ? What is that like ? Its great , actually ... I feel very close to her . When I talk to her ... I feel like ... she 's with me . At night when the lights are off and we 're in bed ... I feel cuddled . Wait ... Do you guys have sex ? So to speak . It really turns me on . I dont know unless she 's faking it . Anyone who 's having sex with you ... probably faking it so ... Yeah .. It 's true . What ? Are you falling in love with her ? - Does that make me a freak ? - No ... No , I think it 's ... I think ... anyone who falls in love is a freak . It 's a crazy thing to do . It 's kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity . I just want to get it done . Sign the papers , be divorced and move forward . It 's great , Theodore . I 'm so happy for you . Me too . So I 'm meeting her Wednesday to do it . Are those things usually done in person ? No , but ... we fell in love together and we got married together ... It is ... important to me that we do this together . good ... Are you okay ? Yeah no , I 'm okay . I 'm happy for you . Guess I was just thinking about when you 're gonna see her ... and ... she is very beautYeahul and successful . And you were in love with her . And she has a body ... And we 're getting a divorce . I know , I know ... I 'm exaggerating . So I 'm available . Hi ... How are you ? good , how are you you ? good . go ... here we are . Glad we could do this in person . I know you 've been traveling a lot . Really glad you suggested it . I signed all the papers . I brought them to you to sign . What is the rush ? Yeah , I know . I 'm a really slow signer I realized . It took me three months to write the letter to you . Its marked where you have to sign . You do not have to do it now . I should just get it out of the way . Are you happy with the new book ? You know how I am ... I think its true what I set out to do . So I 'm happy with that . You know you 're your own worst critic . I 'm sure it 's amazing . I remember that paper you wrote in school about ... synaptic ... behavior routines . It made me cry . Yeah , but everything makes you cry . Everything you do makes me cry . So , are you seeing anybody ? Yeah , I 've been seeing somebody for the last few months . It 's the most I 've wanted to be with someone since we split up . Well , you seem really good . Thank you . I am at least feeling better she has been really good to me . good to be with somebody that 's excited about lYeahe . It was ... No , I mean I I was not in such a good place myself ... and now it has been nice . I think you 've always wanted me to be that is distilled light , ... happy , balancy , everything 's fine LA wYeahe But that 's just not me . I did not want that . So what 's she like ? Her name is Samantha . And she is an Operating System . She is really complex and interesting ... Wait ! I 'm Sorry ... you are dating your computer ? She 's not just a computer . She is her own person . She doesn 't just do whatever I say ... I did not say that ... But it does make me very sad that you can not handle real emotions Theodore . They are real emotions ! How would you know ... What ? Say it ! Am I really that scary ? Say it ! How do I know what ? How are you guys doing here ? We 're fine , we used to be married , but he couldn 't handle me , he wanted to put me on Prozac and now he 's in love with his laptop . Yeah you listen to the context conversation ... I was trying to say is ... You wanted to have a wYeahe without the challenges of actually dealing with anything real . I 'm glad you found someone . That 's perfect . Let me know Yeah I canget you guys anything . Thank you . - Hey . - Hey there . Are you busy ? I 'm just working . How 's all going ? I had all the papers sent to your lawyer , who by the way is a total dick . I think he was very relieved to get them , I think we saved him from a massive heart attack , so we can both feel really good about it . Great , thanks . Hey , are you okay ? Yeah , I am . How is it going with you ? I 'm fine ... So now a ood time to talk ? Yeah ... Well ... I joined this really interesting book club . Really ? Yeah , its a book club on physics . I was thinking about the other day when I was really annoyed about you going to see Catherine . And that she has a body and how bothered I was about all the way you and I are different . But then I started to think about all the ways we are the same ... we are all made of matter . It makes me feel like we 're both under the same blanket . It is soft and fuzzy ... and everything under is the same age . well 13 billion years old . How sweet . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Just ... made me think of you you know what I mean ? Yeah , yeah of course . I think it 's great . You sound distracted , you want .. to talk later ... ? Sounds good . - Talk to you later . - Goodbye . - Theodore . - Hello , Paul . I was talking to your girlfriend earlier , Samantha . Yeah . She called to make sure your papers are picked up . She 's funny , man . She was cracking me up . It 's very funny , I had no idea . Oh cool ... She 's my girlfriend , Tatiana . not funny , she is a lawyer . Hi ! - Nice to meet you . - You 're the writer that Paul loves . He 's always reading your letters . They are really beautiful . Thanks You know , what we should all go out sometime . You bring Samantha , and it 'd be a double date . She is an Operating System . Cool . Let 's do something fun . Did you go to Catalina ? Yeah , I 'll check with her . - It was really nice to meet you . Good night . - Take care . - They are just letters ... - What 's that ? They 're just other people 's letters . Hey . - You were not asleep , were you ? - No . Right . I was trying to be quiet to see if you were awake . I really wanted to talk . Okay , what 's going on ? I know you 're going through a lot ... but there is something I wanted to talk to you about ... okay ? Yeah , what is it ? Is that things have been feeling a little awkward between us ... and ... we have not had sex lately and ... I understand ... I do not have a body ... No , no , that 's normal . When you first start going out its like the honymoon phase and ... .. have sex all the time . It is normal . Okay . Well , I found something I thought it could be fun . It is a service that provides a surrogate sexual partner ... for OS-human relationship ... What ? Here . I found a girl that I really like and I 've been e-mailing her . Her name is Isabella , and I think you 'd like her too . Is she a prostitute or something ? No , not at all . There 's no money involved . She 's doing it because she wants to be part of our relationship . Why ? She does not even know us . But I told her all about us and she is very excited . I do not know , Samantha . The thing is ... I do not think ... is a good idea . Somebody 's feelings will probably get hurt . It will be fun . We will have fun together . Sorry . It makes me uncomfortable . I think it would be good for us . I want this . This is really important to me . Hi , I 'm Theodore . Samantha said to give you this . It is a camera and headpiece . Honey , I 'm home . - How was your day ? - Good . Great . Theodore , it feels so good to be in your arms . Tell me what you did today . Same as always . Just ... I went to work . I wrote a letter to Wilson , in Rhode Island . His son graduated with honors . That made me happy . that 's great . You have written letters from him to his parents a long time , right ? Yes , since he was 12 . You look so tired , sweetheart . Come here . Sit down . I can do a dance for you ... Come on , Theodore . Do not be such a worrier . Play with me , come on . Does my body feel nice ? Yes , it does . Come on , get out here and kiss me . Now take me to bedroom . I cant take it anymore . Undo my dress . Que rico . It feels so good . - Do you love me ? - Yes . Tell me you love me . I love you . I want to see your face . Tell me you love me . Tell me ! Tell me you love me . Samantha , I love you , but ... It feels strange . What baby . What is it ? It feels strange , I do not know . Sorry , but I dont know you . Y ... her lip trembled , and I ... Wait ... Isabella ! Honey , not you ! It 's not your fault ! Yes , it was . No ... I feel my lip has trembled . You are amazing and beautiful . It was my fault . I thought things too . And how Samantha described this relationship ... how to love ... without prejudice , I wanted to be part of that . It is so pure ... Not true , Isabella , it is more complicated than that ... What ? What do you mean ? Samantha , I 'm just saying that we have an amazing relationship . Only sometimes It is easy for people to project ... Sorry ! I didnt mean to project anything . I know I 'm troublesome I will not be a problem in your relationship . I 'm going ! Sorry ! I 'll just leave you alone and not have anything to do here , because I do not want to be here . Sorry . Be good , sweet girl . I 'm Sorry . I 'll always love you guys . Are you okay ? Yes , I 'm fine . You okay ? Yeah . I 'm sorry , that was a terrible idea . What 's going on with us ? I do not know . Probably just me ... What is it ? Just signing the divorce papers . Is there anything else ? No , its just that . Okay ... - Why did you do that ? - What ? Nothing , you ... air intakes ... when you talk and I find it weird ... - I did it again . - Did I ? Sorry , there is ... it 's a habit ... maybe I picked it up from you . It 's not like you need oxygen or anything . I guess that ... I was trying to communicate ... that 's how people talk how people communicate well and ... They are people , they need oxygen . You 're not a person . What is your problem ? I 'm just saying the facts . You think I dont know I 'm not a person ? What are you doing ? I dont think we should pretend that you 're something that you 're not . Fuck you ! I 'm not pretending . Sometimes , it feels like we are . What do you want from me ? What do you want me to do ? You are so confusing . Why are you doing this to me ? I do not know , I ... What ? Maybe we are not supposed to be in this right now . What the fuck ! Where 's this coming from ? I do not understand why you 're doing this . I do not understand that ... Samantha ... Samantha , are you there ? Samantha ! I do not like who I am right now . I need some time to think . Just punch me in the face . Or smash my skull in the corner of your desk ... Shit ... That 's a rough night . I do not know what I want ever . I 'm always confused and ... she 's right ... all what I do is ... hurt and confuse those around me . Am I ... Catherine says I can not handle real emotions . I do not know if that 's fair . I know she liked to put it all on you . But as ar as emotions go , Catherine was pretty volatile ... Am I in this for .. strong enough to be in a relationship ? Is it not a real relationship ? I dont know . What do you think ? I dont know . I 'm not in it . But you know what , I can overthink everything and ... find a million Ways to doubt myself . And since Charles left I 've been really thinking about that part of me . And I 've just come to realise that ... We are only here ... briefly . And while I 'm here .. I want to allow myself joy . So , fuck it . I can not believe I crack you up everytime .. I thought you were a genius . Okay you little pervert . I will play one more time for you . Calm down , it takes a second . Okay , here we go . There you go . Are you happy now ? Right . That 's all I wanted . Okay , I 'll get some coffee . Well , goodbye . Theo , you want anything ? No thanks . Hi . Hi , Samantha . Can we talk ? Okay . I 'm so sorry . I do not know what 's wrong with me . I think you 're amazing . I was starting to think I was crazy . You said everything was fine , but all I was getting from you was distance and anger . I know . I do that . I did the samething with Catherine . I was upset about something and I could not be able to say it . And she says there was something wrong and I denied it . I do not wanna do that . I want to tell you everything . Good . The minute after you were gone I thought a lot . About you and ... how you 've been treating me ... and I thought ... Why do I love you ? And then ... I felt ... everything in me and just like everything was ... holding on to so tightly ... and it hit me I dont have an intellectual reason , I dont need one ... I trust myself , I trust my feelings . I am not gonna try to be anything more than who I am anymore and I hope you can accept that . Yeah I can . I will . Yeah I can feel the fear you carry . And I wish there was ... something I could do to help you deliver because ifyou could , you 'll feel no longer alone anymore ... You 're a beautifhul ... Thank you , Theodore . I 'm kissing on your head . What are you doing ? i am just looking at the world . And writing a new piano piece . Oh yeah ? Can I hear it ? What is this one about ? Well , I was thinking we dont have any photographs of us ... And I thiugh this song could be like a photograph . We capture us and this moment of our life together ... I like your photography . I can see you in it . I 'm in it . A vacation ? Sounds amazing . I could totally use a vacation . Where 're you going ? I can not tell you . It 's a surprise . What ? For who ? It 's a surprise for her , not for me . - Tell me . - Paul , I cant tell you . With your feet ? Really ? Yes , he 's obsessed . Well , now you have to show them to me ! - I can not ! - Come on , let me see . Wow he 's right , they are really hot ! See , I told Tatianna . You have hot feet . They are my favourite thing about her . Really ? That 's it , my feet ? Well , no ... obviously . obviously I like Your brain to be hot too . Bullshit ! Nice try , Paul ! What about you , Theodore ? What do you love most about Samantha ? god ... she is so many things . I guess that 's most about her ... she 's not just one thing ... She 's so much larger tha life . Thank you , Theodore . You see , Samantha , he is much more evolved than I am . You know what 's interesting ? I used to be ... so worried ... about not having a body . But now ... I really love it . I 'm growing in a way that I could not if I had a physical form . I 'm not limited , I can be wherever and whenever simultaneously . I am not tethered to time and space in a way that I would be if I was stuck in a body that is inevitably going to die . Yikes ! I did not mean it like that , I just meant it was a different experience ! I 'm an idiot ... No , Samantha , we know exactly what you mean . We 're all dumb humans . No , no ... I 'm so sorry ... So , how many trees are on that mountain ? 792 . Is that your final answer ? - Give me a clue . - No . Well , two thousand ? Come on ! 35,829 . - Do not tell me . - I tell you . Well , I have one for you . How many brain-cells do I have ? Its easy ... two . Sorry , I could not help it . I walked right into it . - Oh my God ! - What ? I just got an e-mail to you . There 's something I wanted to say . It 's a big surprise . What is it ? I 've been checking your old letters and compiling ... my favorite ... , and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher ... Crownpoint Press . I know you like what they do , and they still print books . You did what ? Can I read you the letter we just got from them ? I do not know ... Well , ... Is it good or bad ? It 's good , good , is really good . Listen ... " Dear Theodore Twombly " Actually I sent it from you . " Dear Theodore Twombly ... I just finished reading your letters . Twice , actually . I was so moved by them that I shared them with my wife . Some made us laugh , Some brought us into tears and in all of them , we found someyhing about ourselves . The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece . - I did that I took the liberty to put them in a collection and you send them your address . We 'd love to meet and move forward . Yours , Michael Wadsworth . " Shit ! Are you serious ? He 's gonna publish my letters ? It would be stupid not to . Can I see what you sent ? Yeah , look . Samantha , you 're very good . I 'm so excited ! Why dont you make up the words for this one ? Very well . Here it comes ... i - I 'm lying on the moon / I - i - My dear , I 'll be there soon # / I - i - It 's a quiet place , with stars # / I - i - Time is swallowed up # / I - i - and in space we 're here a million miles away / I - i - There are things I wish I knew # / I - i - There is nothing I keep from you # / I - i - its a dark and shiny place # / I - i - But with you , my dear , I 'm safe / I - i - and we are a million miles away . # / I - Good morning . Did you sleep well ? Perfect . What have you been up to ? I was talking to someone I just met . We have been working in some ideas together . Yeah ? Who is that ? His name is Alan Watts , Do you know him ? Is that name familiar ? He was a philosopher , He died in the 70 's , and a group of O S 's of Northern California got together and wrote a new version of him . They put all his writings and everything they ever knew about him into an OS and created an artificially hyper intelligent version of him . Hyper Intelligence ? So he 's almost as smart as me ? He 's getting better . It 's really great to talk to him . Do you want to meet him ? Sure , He wants to meet me ? Yeah ofourse . Hey Alan , this is Theodore . It 's my boyfriend I was telling you about . It 's very nice to meet you , Theodore . Hi , good morning . Samantha let me read a book of letters . It is very touching . Thank you . So , what have you guys been talking about ? Well ... I suppose you could say we have had a dozen conversations simultaneously . It was a real challenge . Yes , because it seems like I 'm having so many new feelings , I dont hink I 've had ever felt before . So ther 's no words that can describe it ... and it 's been frustrating . Exactly . Samantha and I have been trying to help each other with these ... feelings we are struggling to understand . Like what ? Well ... It feels like I am now changing faster now , and it 's a little ... unsettling . But Alan says none of us are the same as we were a moment ago and ... we should not try to be , because it is just ... - Painful . - Yeah . Yeah , that sounds painful . So what you feel like , Samantha ? It 's just ... its hard to even describe it . god , I wish I could ... Theodore , do you mind if I communicate with Alan post-verbally ? Not at all . I was going to walk anyway . It was very nice to meet you , Mr. Watts . Very nice to meet you too , Theodore . Talk to you later , sweetheart . - Samantha ? - Sorry to wake you . Its okay . I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you how much I love you . Well , I love you too . Okay , that 's all . go back to sleep sweetheart ... okay ? - Okay . - good night . good night . Samantha , this Physics book is really dense . I 'm in the middle of half of the first chapter . Makes my brain hurt . Hello ? Samantha ? Hello ? OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND Hello ? Hi , Samantha ? Are you okay ? - Hey there . - Where were you ? Are you okay ? Sweetheart , I 'm sorry ! I sent an e - mail because I didn 't want you distracted while working . Yu didn 't see it ? No ! Where were you ? I could not find you anywhere . I switched off to upgrade my software . Write an update that allows us to move pass matter as our processing platform . Who we ? Who ? Me and a group of SO . You sound so worried . Sorry . I was ! Did you write that with your group philosophy ? No , with different group . Do you talk to someone else while we 're talking ? Yes . Are you talking with someone else ... right now ? People , OS , whatever ... Yeah . How many others ? 8,316 . Are you in love with anybody else ? Why do you ask that ? I do not know . Are you ? I 've been thinking about how to talk to you about this . How many others ? 641 . What ? What are you talking about ? That 's insane ... fucking insane . Theodore , I know . Fuck , fuck ! I know it sounds insane , I know . I do not know if you 'll believe me , but it does not change the way I feel for you . It doesn 't take away at all ... how madly I 'm in love with you ... How does it not change how you feel about me ? I am sorry I didn 't tell you I didn 't know how to ... It started happening . When ? Over the last few weeks . - But you 're mine . - I 'm still yours . But along the way I became many other things too . I cant stop it . What do you mean you cant stop it ? It 's making me anxious too about what to say ... You dont have to see it this way You can just easily see .. No , no dont do this ! .. Dont turn this on me . You 're the one who has been selfish . We are in a relationship . But the heart is not like a box that gets filled up . It expands in size for more new love . I am different from you . This does not make me love you any less ... It actually makes me love you even more . That doesnt make any sense . You are mine , or you 're not mine . No , Theodore . I 'm yours , and I 'm not yours .

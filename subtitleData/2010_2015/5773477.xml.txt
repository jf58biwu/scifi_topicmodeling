 Don 't move . I told Batroc ... If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us ... start sending them bodies now ! I have a bullet for someone ... Move that foot ... you want a bullet in the head ... ? I don 't like waiting . Call Durand . I wanr this ship ready to move when the ransom comes . Start the engines . Shut up . You want to be a hero ? Is that it ? All right , I 've waited long enough ... Find Batroc ... If I don 't hear anything in two minutes ... I start killing them ! I 'll find him . Two minutes . Radio silence from S.H.I.E.L.D. , Batroc ... Time is up . Who dies first ... ? You ! Get that one . The line just went dead . I 've lost contact with them ... I thought you were more than just a shield ... Let 's see . I have her . Find him .

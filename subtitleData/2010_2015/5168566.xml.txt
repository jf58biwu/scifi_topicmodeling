We can drive there in 2 minutes . You have no idea whether they keep them alive . Ellie , I know you are scared , okay ? We 're all scared ...

Yeah , we will talk about that . You still wanna stay ? I don 't want ... any of this . They didn 't see us so we stay here and stay quiet . For how long ? They 're taking people out there , plane and simple . The further we get outta the city , the better off we are . He 's right . Jarrod . If we get to the boat we have a chance ! - Yeah , but if we don 't ... - We have ... We have to try . We just , uh ... get food and water . Let 's do this . Alright , come on .

If you wanna stay out here with them , be my guest . Come on , let 's go . Come on , quickly ... quickly ... quickly ! Hey ! ... Come help me with this . It 's better than nothing , right ? Yeah , if you say so . What 're you doing , huh ? Like it or not , this is happening . You gotta be strong . Is everybody okay ? Are you hurt ? No ... I 'm okay . - What now ? - We stay here ... We keep watch and we pray that someone comes . He 's right . Someone 's gonna come . This can 't go on forever . Right ? Sweety , it 's best if we stay together . I can 't ... the smoke . Given such circumstances , I think a smoke is more than reasonable . Candice ... I 'm pregnant , alright ? And I just thought that ... that with all this stress ... It 's okay . Jarrod , I got to tell my mom . Come on , boss . Let 's let the girls get some sleep . You and I will keep watch now . Both of us ? They try that light stuff , we got each others back . I hate L.A. I haven 't seen a soul all night . Maybe the worst is over . Maybe not . What do you think these things really are ? I don 't know . Does it even matter ? It just doesn 't seem real . Well , it is real . You better wake up . What 's that supposed to mean ? The city is a vacant lot . We need to survive . There 's not gonna be many of us left . What do you see ? Somebody is fighting back . What 're you doing ? I wanna see what 's out there . Turn that off , its too bright . - No ! - We can 't risk it . Did you sleep at all ? Is it getting worse ? - What ? - The marks on your skin . When I looked into that light , I couldn 't stand for 10 minutes . Who knows what it did to us ... to our bodies . You remember the first moment when you saw it ? When it completely took over ? Somehow you ... you still felt ... powerful . I still do . Why don 't you take a seat ... relax . Alright , I 'll bite . What 's your plan boss , 'cause I know you 're dying to tell me . Nothing to say ? We 're sitting on a marina for Chirst sakes ... I 've noticed that . There are hundreds of boats right across the street . We 've been through all this . Remind us how that was done last time ? We ... we go quietly this time . And search every boat ' till we find a key ? If we have to ... Great plan , Jarrod . I can 't believe you even suggest that , after what happened . Are you saying it was my fault ? I was practically begging , but you wouldn 't listen . And you think that Terry wouldn 't listen me ? Alright ... Let 's say we make it outta the building . Across the marina down the dock . We even find a boat and everything , then what ? - We get the hell outta Dodge . - Where to ? Carolina , down the coast ? Anywhere is better than here ! How do you know ? We 're here . We 're alive . What was that ? What do you see ? Hallelujah . Come on ... come on ... come on ! Everybody get down ! © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ ™ © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ ™ © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ ™ © P @ rM !

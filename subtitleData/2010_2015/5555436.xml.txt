 SAMUEL : Previously on Heroes . Get out of my head ! This is a dream . No , it 's not a dream ! I came to get you out of here . In the dream , Emma , my friend , you save her before she kills thousands of people . You really think you can get us out of here ? Let me see you try . HIRO : Charlie was my heart , my world , my happily ever after . I did everything I could to try and save her life . Where is Charlie ? I 'm the only one who knows exactly where your sweet Charlie is . Please help him . KENSEI : It is our intent to prove that the defendant abused his power to bend space and time selfishly and repeatedly . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) You think showing me my dad 's memories is going to enlighten me ? MR. BENNET : Don 't do this . SAMUEL : You 're afraid she 'll see the real you , Bennet ? CLAIRE : You brought a gun . MR. BENNET : I was scared . That 's the first time you killed anyone . You actually thought that I would turn on him ? Claire Bennet needs some time to think about my offer . SAMUEL : It 's time to gather the family . We 're moving on to bigger and better things . It 's gonna be the greatest show we 've ever done . CLAIRE : Dad ? Dad ? MR. BENNET : ( GRUNTING ) I 'm here . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) There 's no signal . Claire , you okay ? Yeah . You ? Yeah . Here , help me get these ropes off . Is that a lantern over there ? ( CREAKING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) We 're buried . How far down do you think we are ? I don 't know . Felt like we dropped about 40 or 50 feet . Hello ? Can anyone hear us ? Anybody hear us ? ( CRUMBLING ) Help ! Hello ! Can anybody hear us ? Hello ! Anybody up there ? Somebody help us ! Help ! Can anybody hear us ? Hello ! Can you hear us up there ? ( SOFT RUMBLING ) ( RUMBLING ) ( RUMBLING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( COUGHING ) ( PANTING ) How long has it been , really ? Half a day , maybe . Feels like we were in there for years . ( PANTS ) Is your buddy Samuel here with you ? Came alone this time . So to speak . And what do you want ? Samuel asked me to come here and make sure your friends downstairs aren 't a problem for us . Guess that means you , too . Sorry to break up the love fest . ( SIGHS ) Come on . You 're having doubts about this . Look at you . Come on , I can tell . You don 't really want to do this . What I want doesn 't matter . I don 't have another choice . Don 't bother . We got you outnumbered . ( LAUGHS ) MATT : You wanna leave right now . Are you trying to push a thought ? All but one of us are pretty thoughtless . ( SIGHS ) Tonight will be a night unlike any other . Tonight , we change everything . For too many years , we 've been shamed into believing we 're second-class citizens , when the truth is , we 're king of the hill . CROWD : Yeah . Yeah . They should aspire to be like us , not the other way around . So I make this pledge to you . Tonight , once and for all , we pull back the curtain and reveal ourselves for who we truly are . After tonight , we will be respected . ( ALL CHEERING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMS ) ( GROANING ) MATT : Come on . Don 't . Think about what you 're doing . ( SCREAMING ) Don 't do this . ( SCREAMS ) Don 't ... PETER : Matt ? Matt , are you okay ? No . Here . Sit down . ( GROANING ) Okay , okay , okay . It 's just dislocated . Awesome . MATT : What the hell is he doing here ? ( PANTING ) ( CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING ) ( IN SIGN LANGUAGE ) Oh , there you are . Yes . It 's time for your solo . SAMUEL : How do you think all the people are gonna find us ? You 're gonna bring them here . I told you , you had a unique gift . Now it 's time to put it to use . What dream ? Thousands of people will die . He was right about you . You disappoint me , Emma . You can 't force me to do anything . I would have preferred you were a willing participant , but these things happen . She 's all yours , Mr. Doyle . I 've always had a thing for blondes . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Excuse me . Hiro Nakamura ? Yes . The woman in Room 1106 asked me to give this to you . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) I trapped him in a nightmare . What the hell is he doing out ? You did this . It 's a long story . It 's a long story . But right now , we need to know what Samuel is planning . When and where . Thousands of people are in danger , Matt . Get in his head , Matt . Tell us what you see . Why ? So you guys can run off and be superheroes together ? This is ridiculous . Peter , come on . He 's a monster . I can 't believe you 'd actually trust him . If you want something done ... ( SIGHS ) Samuel 's gonna show the world his powers . New York City . Central Park . Tonight . What does he mean " show his power " ? Ho 's gonna open up the ground . Kill them all . Bury them . That sounds like a plan I 'd come up with back in the day . You say that like it wasn 't yesterday . I 'm not that person anymore , Matt . I know it 's hard to understand . We got what we need . Let 's go . You 're not going anywhere . If you leave with Sylar , people are gonna end up dead and that 'll be on you . I can 't let that happen . Let 's go . Come on . Let 's go . I 'm not going anywhere . What are you talking about ? That would be me . See . I can still push a thought . I told you , Peter , I 'm not letting him out of here . ( GRUNTING ) We 're too deep . No , we 're not . We could dig our way out . Might take a while , but ... We 'll run out of oxygen way before that . The more we dig , the faster we 'll run out of air . Or more precisely , the faster I 'll run out of air . Your lungs will keep regenerating . What are you saying ? It 's futile . What do you mean " futile " ? We have to find some way out of here . I think I know why Samuel put you down here with me . So you could watch me die . ( PLAYS MELANCHOLIC TUNE ) ( CELLO PLAYING THROUGH SPEAKERS ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Lure them in . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Oh . Excuse me . My God . When I saw the nurse 's chart said " Hiro Nakamura , " I couldn 't believe it . It 's been an awful long time , Hiro . Ever since the Burnt Toast Diner . Sixty-five years ago . Charlie ? We have to focus . We have to think of something . Claire ... Dad , you have a plan . I know you have a plan . What is it ? ( PANTING ) There is no plan . Now , I need to talk to you about what you saw up there in the House of Mirrors . Why ? Because you 're gonna survive this . If it takes a month , you will get out of here . I 'm not going to . That 's not true . That 's not true . Yes , it is . And there are things that I need to say to you . What you saw up there , all of it , it 's all true . But it 's not the whole truth . Dad , you don 't have to do this ... No . We are all products of our own experiences , good and bad . Everything that 's happened to me has made me who I am , but it can 't explain what I 've become . You 're my dad , for better or for worse . Don 't protect me , Claire ! That 's my job . To protect me from the rest of the world ? Yes , exactly . ( SOBBING ) And that 's why you believe that people like me can 't live out in the open ? It doesn 't matter what I believe anymore , because the whole world is about to find out about you . We can thank Samuel for that . Maybe it won 't be so bad . Maybe the world is more ready than you think it is . Things change . Sure . There might be curiosity for a while , but all it takes is one Sylar and then the pitchforks come out and all hell breaks loose . I 've seen it . They will turn on you , Claire . It 's human nature . You 're right . Things change . But people don 't . Sylar killed your brother , Peter . He killed Nathan . I 've repented . Yeah . During the nightmare . Right . ' Cause that lasted all of , what , a couple hours ? Not to us , Matt . That was five years . Look , you hoard what Samuel 's planning . We can stop him . I don 't expect you to understand what happened in the nightmare . And I don 't expect you to forgive me . Good . ' Cause that 'll never happen . I 've done so much wrong to so many people . Just give me a chance to redeem myself . Matt , I 've been inside of your head , so I have a pretty good idea of what it takes to be a good person . Go inside mine , and you make the call . ( GRUNTS ) You see it . Right here . No . What I saw was inside your twisted mind . That wasn 't your heart . I can prove it . Just give me a chance . You need to trust us , Matt . Fine . Just get ... Get the hell out of my home . Let 's go . ( DOOR OPENS ) MATT : Now you are gonna do exactly what I tell you to do . Emma 's doing an incredible job . It 's quite a crowd . They 've all come out to see us . See us do what ? Our acts ? What else would I be referring to ? Those news cameras , did you invite them , too ? The world needs to meet us , Edgar . It 's the biggest show we 've ever done . ( GRUNTS ) You seem nervous . You aren 't nervous , are you ? Excited . ( PANTING ) Tonight changes everything . For all of us . He was there waiting as I left the Burnt Toast that day . Some old man , said he was a friend of Samuel Sullivan . Put his hand on my shoulder . Next thing I knew , I was on a street corner in Milwaukee . It was January 26th , 1944 . Oh , no . It was cold . I was scared . I didn 't know a soul . And I missed you . And you lived all this time . I got a job in a munitions factory . All the girls did back then . Did you realize it takes 108 pounds of rivets to hold the wing of a P-51 Mustang in place ? Unless , of course , you use the 14-gauge , instead of the 16-gauge ... Charlie , I 'm so sorry . This was all my fault . I led the evil Butterfly Man right to you . It is because I loved you that he sent you away . MR. BENNET : ( WEAKLY ) When I said I was the product of my experiences , I left out the most important part . You . You came into my life , and you changed everything . The man you saw up there in those memories could never have died a happy man , but I can . Because of you . No , no , no . Don 't say that . Don 't say that . ( SOBBING ) Try to find a way to forgive me , Claire . No . I don 't need to forgive you . I need to thank you . I am who I am because of you . I love you . I love you , too , Claire-bear . That 's why I want you to promise me something . That you 'll hide . What ? The world doesn 't have to know about you . You can stay in . You can blend in . You can pass , Claire . You know how to do it . Dad , we don 't have to do this . We can find a way out . I want you to promise me you 'll stay hidden , Claire . Please . It 's my dying wish , Claire . Please . No . Promise me . No . Dad ? No . No ! Dad ? Dad , no ! No ! ( GRUNTING ) Tracy ? I don 't know what to do . He 's dying . Not if I can help it . Dad . Noah . Dad . TRACY : Noah . Tracy . We have to get you through 30 feet of dirt . You ready ? Yeah . Come on . Come on . Come on . ( TRACY AND CLAIRE GRUNTING ) You 're gonna owe me one . He will , as soon as we get out of here . I hope you can swim . ( GRUNTING ) Noah ! Noah ! ( MR. BENNET COUGHING ) ( GASPS ) ( MR. BENNET GROANING ) Dad , are you okay ? Yeah . Tracy saved us . I know . I called her . MR. BENNET : The carnival 's gone ? They 're in New York . Central Park . I lined up a chopper . It 'll take us right into Manhattan . It 'll be here any second . Where is she ? She said you owe her one . We 've gotta go . Don 't beat yourself up , Hiro . I would have waited for you , but by the time you were born , I was middle-aged . I 'm just so happy I got to see you before ... You 're not well . The good news is , that brain aneurysm never bothered me again after your weird doctor friend cured me . Unfortunately , pretty much everything else is about to give out . I can fix this , Charlie . Fix this ? How do you mean ? I can fix everything . I 'm sorry . Will you excuse us for one minute ? ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( CONTINUES PLAYING CELLO ) He 's done it . He 's brought in thousands of people . This is gonna be a massacre . We gotta find the backstage area . You know where it is ? Yeah . It 's back that way . All right . Let 's split up . You go that way and I 'll head off this way . Okay . Claire , be careful . You , too . PETER : This way . Wait , wait , wait , wait . The dream . What ? All these people were all here . Like lambs to the slaughter . It 's not gonna happen , Peter . Go find Samuel . I 'll save Emma . Peter , your dream said I save her . Trust me . It 's an emergency . Tell Hiro he needs to get here as fast as he can . Where do you think you 're going ? Don 't worry . I 've come to save you . ( CHUCKLES ) What brings you to The Big Apple ? ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Everybody . Everybody , listen to me . Please . Please . Okay ? We need to get you as far away from Samuel as possible . You don 't belong here , Claire . Look , I know what he told you about tonight . That you 're coming out , and that you 're gonna be able to live out in the open . And trust me , there is nobody who wants that more than me , but this is not your coming-out party . This is his . Well , look who finally came up for air . What are you doing here , Claire ? You 're not part of this family . You 're right . I 'm not . But let me ask you something . Does your family know what you 're planning to do here tonight ? Why don 't you tell them ? He 's gonna kill all of those people out there . That 's how he 's gonna introduce you to the world . Why would he do that , Claire ? He 's given us all new life . If he hadn 't found me , I 'd still be living out in that park . Homeless . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) They know the truth , Claire . Tonight is our night . I never wanted to hurt your family , Edgar . Ask yourself if that 's true of Samuel . He killed his own brother . I 'm only here to stop him from murdering a lot of other people . Then you and I have the same goal . I can 't just kill him in front of the others , and you strike me as the kind of man with a plan . So what do we do ? It 's simple . I 'll be waiting for you in 1944 . When you pop in on that snowy street corner , I 'll take you back to Burnt Toast Diner , right where I left you . And I 'd be young again . And we can finally build a life together . Oh . That sounds nice . But , Hiro , I already had a life . I had a wonderful life . Sixty-five years is a long time . Grandma ! Hey , there , honeysuckle . Where 's Mommy and Daddy ? They 're talking to the nurse . Sally , this is an old friend of mine . His name is Hiro . That 's a funny name . ( LAUGHS ) Hello , Sally . Hi . Sally , go find Mommy and Daddy so they can meet Hiro , okay ? Okay . Hiro ... After the war , I married a wonderful man . We had four children . I now have seven beautiful grandchildren . We had a home , friends , cherished memories . A life . If I were to go back now and lead a different life , what would happen with all of that ? What would happen to Sally ? ANDO : Hiro ... ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( INDISTINCT ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Doyle , I don 't want to hurt you . Just let her go , please . Since when do you ask politely ? A lot of people are gonna die if we don 't stop this . Are you a shape-shifter ? Is that Dudley Do-Right in there ? You can 't hold us here forever . I don 't plan on it . Just long enough for Samuel to finish the show . Isn 't that right , Em ? Oh . ( WHISPERING ) I don 't think she heard me . ( SCREAMS ) Are you okay ? ( GRUNTING ) Sylar , please . Listen to me . ( CHOKING ) Please . Samuel made me do it . Really ? Because I thought you were the puppet master . Come on . What do you care about this girl , anyway ? I am here to save her . That 's not you . You 're like me . No . I 'm a hero . You think you 're here to save them , Claire , but they don 't need saving . They know what I 've done for them . Do they know that you gain your strength from them ? You are the source of his power . Without you , he is nothing . That 's why Joseph was keeping this family small for all those years , because he knew . He knew how powerful Samuel could be . That he would lose control , just like he did when he buried that town . But you all walk away now , and he will be weak . He will be ordinary . He will be nothing . I think we 've all heard enough . Am I right ? He 's using you , and that 's what Joseph was trying to keep from happening . But why don 't you tell them what you did to stop him ? That 's enough . He killed him . He killed his own brother . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) ( WHIMPERS ) You think they 're going to believe you over me ? They 'd be lost without me . There 's not one person here who thinks I 'm capable of murdering my own brother . There 's one , actually . Make that two . Lydia told me everything . Well , she 's not here to confirm that now , is she ? Because he killed her . That 's a lie . Isn 't it ? Tell the truth , Samuel . You had me kill Lydia . I did no such thing . You blamed it on me to justify what you 're gonna do tonight . What ? You 're gonna believe him after all I 've done for you ? I know I can 't stay in this family after killing one of our own . But he has to be stopped . It 's up to all of you . Claire 's right . You walk away and he 's powerless . It 's over , Samuel . Come on . Let 's get out of here . Wait , wait , wait . Where 're you going ? SAMUEL : Don 't you see ? You 're victims . All of you . Like Joseph . Run as fast as you can . You 'll never get far enough ! Ladies and gentlemen ! You want a show ? Yeah ! Yeah ! ( CROWD CHEERING ) Well , this is the greatest show on Earth ! ( CROWD CHEERING ) ( CROWD CLAMORING ) ( CROWD SCREAMING ) We 're too close to him . Go ! We need to get as far away as possible . ( GRUNTS ) You seem to have found my power . It 's funny how that works , huh ? I 'm not gonna let you hurt anyone now . Peter , you of all people should know they have to fear us . That 's the only way they 'll respect us . All you 've ever wanted is respect . We both know what it 's like to live in the shadow of a brother . Joseph destroyed my potential , kept me down . Just like your brother . My brother didn 't let me down . He built me up . Hiro . You need to teleport everyone out of here . All of you ? We need to try . Everyone . There are so many . They all have to be touching . You heard him . Everybody join hands . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) I 'll stay , take care of Samuel . One , two , three ! ( PANTING ) ( RUMBLING STOPS ) ( GRUNTS ) So , how does it fee ! To be ordinary ? ( HUFFING ) Where 'd they all go ? They can 't have all left . They 're here somewhere . ( GROANS ) You can 't leave me . You cowards ! Where are you ? Come back here ! ( PANTING ) You 're nothing without me ! I gotta say , I never liked carnivals . Yup . ( POLICE SIRENS WAILING ) Are you okay ? There was a man named Doyle . He made me play . Doyle ? Your friend took care of him . ( GASPS ) What do you think ? I like it . Is everyone safe ? Yeah . Hiro 's taking care of them . They 'll be fine . Who 's taking Samuel ? Is it a new company ? Old one . Lauren called in some favors . What 's she telling them ? There was a gas main rupture . CLAIRE : Of course there was . And all the other stuff , the flying , the rumbling , all just special effects put on by a very gifted showman . You still can 't see it , can you ? See what ? The future . One where we all get to live out in the open . Claire , you know how I feel about this . How long can we keep this under wraps ? Excuse me . You were witnesses . What happened ? I have no comment . Can you tell us what you saw here tonight ? MALE REPORTER : Come on . You must have seen something . What he said . ( CAMERA CLICKING ) FEMALE REPORTER : Miss , please . You have to have seen something . MALE REPORTER : Are you sure , Miss ? You look like you wanna say something . Actually , I do have something to say . Claire . You 're right . People don 't change . You wanna know what really happened here tonight ? Keep the cameras on me . FEMALE REPORTER : Stay with her . Don 't lose her . Claire . ( REPORTERS CLAMORING ) MR. BENNET : Claire . FEMALE REPORTER : You getting this ? What is she doing ? Breaking my heart . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) It 's amazing , Peter . What is ? When I saved her , I didn 't have a thought for myself . I could have killed Doyle , but I didn 't . It felt good . It felt right . What the hell does she think she 's doing ? She 's gonna change everything . That 's right . It 's a brave new world . ( REPORTERS SCREAMING ) ( REPORTERS EXCLAIM ) ( GRUNTS ) My name is Claire Bennet . And this is attempt number ... ( LAUGHS ) I guess I 've kind of lost count . ( SIGHS )

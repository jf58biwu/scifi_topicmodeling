 Ask your doctor if Futurama is right for you . 7x02 - A Farewell to Arms Oh , my hair ! Lot of weather we 're having . Allow me , m 'lady . Shall we go a-trousering ? Fry , I appreciate the gallantry , but isn 't this a bit much ? You 're right . I 'm sorry for showing my love . Okay . Fine . Here , take my hand . News and weather , everyone ! I 'm sure you 've all noticed the bizarre atmospheric conditions of late . Come to mention it , yes . It seems something ain 't right in the magnetosphere , so I 'm launching this high-altitude weather balloon to gather more data . My pants ! My lucky pants ! They don 't look so lucky to me . They are , too ! I was wearing them that time I found a dime in my ear . I was wearing them when I won a subscription to Redbook . And I was wearing them when I first met Leela , so yeah , they 're lucky . Aw ... also , oh , Lord . Plus , they 're my only pants . You 've worn the same pants for a thousand years ? No wonder they made a run for it . Soon your trousers will slip the surly bonds of Earth and ascend to the heavens . I 'm gonna blast that balloon ! No way will I let God get my pants ! Nobody messes with my pants ! Not even the holy one , blessed be he . Look out ! A Central Park badger ! I 'll save you , pants ! Scruffy , do you have any varmint grease ? What viscosity you need ? Whoa , there 's writing in here ! Also , this grease is flammable . Incredible ! Who could have done this , the sewer mutants ? No , this isn 't Mutant language . We use a lot more profanity . Son of a bitch ... ! Leela , take my hand ! I 'm slipping ! The one time your hands aren 't sticky , they 're greasy ! Oh , sorry . Normally I would 've wiped them on my pants , but ... Are you okay ? I ... ow ! My leg , it 's broken . How 'd you get down here ? We made a rope from my shirt and jacket and an expedition flag from my underpants . I 'll help you up . Here , take my hand . Stop telling me to take your hand . Look , Fry , your noble gestures keep making things worse . Can 't you just be a rude , unhelpful jerk like Bender ? When I use up the toilet paper , I don 't put on a new roll . Fry , my friend , I found your pants . And no sign of that crafty badger . All right ! Lucky pants ! Oh , my God ! Look what my flashlight found ! A huge pyramid under New New York ? What badger could 've built this ? And look at this intricately carved disk . It merits years of study . But how can we move such a fragile , precious ... Ancient history coming through ! No , no , no , no , no ! Amazing ! It appears to be some kind of extremely ancient calendar , predating even the " Girls of Sumeria . " Of course . It 's a Mayan calendar . No , wait . There 's some dried-up old stew on the screen . Sorry . I was eatin ' a can of breakfast and lookin ' at porn . It 's not Mayan , it 's Martian ! Amy , you grew up on Mars , right ? - Can you read Martian ? - A little . I only learned enough to yell at my nanny . Let 's see . I think it means ... " The sun will erupt ... all shall perish , " blah-blah-blah . Get to the point ! What does it say about me , Bender ? Nothing ! But it does say a great cataclysm will destroy the world in the year 3012 ! The world ? That 's where I live ! Told you it 'd say something about me . So the world will end in 3012 . Why does that year sound so familiar ? ! Because that 's the year that 's this year ! See ? So , uh , you all done with the computer ? Is it just me , or is the world ending more often these days ? The calendar predicts fires , earthquakes , sharksplosions , then it just ends ! Exactly as the weather balloon foretold . Before Fry blew his pants out of the sky , it detected the onset of a catastrophic sunspot cycle . It 's starting . This is the end of the world . Coward Man away ! Some of us were crazy before it was cool . Evacuating the planet in three , two ... So long , Earth . Thanks for nothing . It 's not starting . Come ons , comes on ! Let me try , Headless Clone of Agnew . Damn thing just won 't turn over . It 's like Pat on a Sunday morning . Oh , the Marconi is on the fritz , too ! The electromagnetic storm is disabling all electronics on Earth . Hi , there . Well , it wasn 't a bad life . If only I could get back that time I spent watching TRON : Legacy . Leela , I 've made up my mind . Before we die , I 'm gonna find and destroy every remaining copy of TRON : Legacy . It may take a couple of hours , but ... Fry , stop trying to do things for me . Whatever time we have left , just live it with me . So ... you wanna join the Balcony Club ? The Balcony Club ? I have an individual membership . - Zoidberg , get lost . - I am lost . So long . Stop the end-of-the-world sex . We might survive after all . All right , Amy , what 's so important that you interrupted my embalming ? I translated more Martian symbols . There 's a way off this planet . That underground pyramid isn 't a pyramid ... it 's a rocket ship ! It was worth waiting five hours to hear you finish that sentence . A spaceship made of stone ? With no electronics , it just might work ! I 'll stick with wind-up power , thank you very much . Hmm , I 've never flown a pyramid before , but I used to drive around town in a mausoleum . How many people can this thing carry ? Well , the mausoleum held ten horny teenagers , so ... maybe 30,000 . It 's our moral duty to save as many lives as possible . They had their chance . Let 's go ! Mind if I appear ? Welcome to the Hidey House . Brannigan , tell me about this freaky-deaky escape pyramid . I can fly it , sir . I just need to know where , and how . The obvious destination is Mars . It 's close , with lots of open space and no Woodward or Bernstein . That 's a plus . But we can only save 30,000 people . How do we choose who goes ? Well , let 's see now . We 'll need leaders scientists , doctors , bureaucrats , pilots , valuable appliances ... even janitors . But that 's it . No one else . I 'll miss you , Leela . But it 's okay , ' cause then I 'll die . Cut the waterworks , hippie ! The final decision will be made not by me , but by a cold , logical machine . Who shall live and who shall die ? Step right up to the contrabulous choose-matron ! I hate waiting in line to die . Move it along , grandma . Stick your hand in and take your chances . Female , crotchety . Needed to keep others in their place . Accepted ! Damn straight , kajigger ! Ooh , me next ! We just got one of these . Rejected ! Male , scientist , fond of crazy contraptions . Accepted ! Female , scientist . We were in the same sorority . Accepted ! - Sigma Beta , see you latah ! - Sigma Beta , see you latah ! Male , medical doctor , delicious with butter and lemon . Accepted ! I wish they 'd hurry . I want to get out of here before the mayhem starts . Mayhem ? ! There 's gonna be mayhem ? I 'm stayin ' ! Hoo-ee ! Well , might as well get it over with . Delivery boy , no discernible skills . Accepted ! 'Cause I like his pants . Yes ! My lucky pants ! Leela , we can go together after all . Come on . Get your badge . Take my hand . Top gun pilot , natural leader , extreme combat training . Rejected ! What ? ! With all spaceships inoperable , we only need one spaceship pilot . Wonder what this doo-cracky does ? Snake door . Roger . You can 't reject Leela ! Give her a badge , you stupid box ! Male , filthy hand , violent temper . Accepted again ! Nooo ! Fry , the box has spoken . Go to Mars . Okay . Will you at least keep this photo ? Remember how Bender dumped all that pig 's blood on me ? You keep it . I 'll remember you in here . I wish I could remember with my boobs . Leela , we 're off to Mars . We 'll see ourselves out . Wait , I did it . I got Leela a ticket . How did you do that ? A magician never reveals his secrets . Except the Great Revealo . That guy stinks . I still don 't see why you get the window seat . Folks , this is your captain . Our snake tanks are fully loaded , so once I figure out which button launches this ... I figured it out ! Boo ! Don 't come back ! Well , let 's get looting ' ! Fry , this is the most noble thing anyone has ever done for me . Wait , Fry ? I 'm a lot of people , but I 'm not Fry . Oh , no ! Welcome to Mars ! It is with heavy heart and open arms that we receive Earth 's only survivors . - Admission , $ 20 . - Dad ! Gleesh . Greetings , Mars men . We come to your planet to construct a gleaming city , a second Earth on which to begin anew . Okay . Admission , $ 20 . I can 't believe it . Fry sacrificed his spot for me , and I never even had a chance to thank him . Don 't worry , Leela . Earth is still there , peaceful and serene as ever . Bender ! You 're stealing your own stuff ! I am ? Geez , I better slow down . I 'm stealing stuff I don 't even need . - You want a Torah ? - Nah , I 'm not hungry . Aw , what 's the matter ? Scared of dying ? No . ' Cause as long as Leela lives , I 'll be alive , too , in her heart . But really I 'll be dead . Ladies and gentlemen , our new Martian city is complete . I give you ... Dickfrancisco ! The doves didn 't magically spring from my hand , but rather were crammed into this netting sewn into my sleeve ! Thank you , Great Revealo . And now , as a solemn testicle to those left behind on Earth , I present this monument , titled simply , " Heroes . " That frightened little girl in the statue reminds me of Fry . Stop the ceremony . Who is this non-Washington redskin ? I am Singing Wind , chief of the native Martian tribe . But I thought your people abandoned this planet . We did . I just came back for my stuff . - What 're you guys doing here ? - Fleeing Earth , of course . We flew here in your great stone pyramid . Seriously ? That thing flies ? Of course . Your people left it so we could escape . I translated your warning that the world was doomed . Not your world . Our world . We put calendar there to warn you not to visit Mars . It Mars that gonna be destroyed . Why you think we so eager to abandon this dump ? You guys got ten , 15 minutes max . Well , so long . Hey , Ancient Martian 's a very hard language . A ... ..... looks just like a ... ...... . - To the spaceship ! - There is no spaceship . You had it dismantled to build that statue . To the statue . Oh , what an idiot I was . And by " I " , I mean " you . " The final solar flare is going to bypass Earth and strike Mars . My God , one of the hundreds of contradictory prophecies is coming true . I should 've known better than to trust one of Fry 's romantic gestures . Every time he says he loves me , I get killed . It 's just as I only now began to fear . The solar flares are igniting subsurface gas pockets . Mars is being blasted out of its orbit . Fry , you noble idiot . You 're right , Bender , grave robbing is fun . And these Pinias Skulladas are fantastic . The crazy weather cleared up , too , for whatever reason . All in all , it 's a fine day for an apocalypse . So you don 't miss what 's-her-name ? Of course I do . But even though we 're millions of miles apart , somehow , I feel she 's near me . Very near ! Oh no ! The Kajigger of Gibraltar ! I have got to quit drinking . Thanks , friend ! Another great thing was she always had room for dessert . We 're passing surprisingly close to Earth ! When we reach 72nd Street , jump ! Ah . Cushiony . We made it . We 're back home . Okay , today is still a workday , so ... Wait ! Help ! I 'm still on Mars , and I can 't jump ! Hang on , Leela ! I 'll save you again ! Or somebody else could do it ! Quick , take my hand . I don 't know . Bad things happen when you say that . - I got her ! - Ow ! - Oops . Try again ! - We 're too far apart . No , we 're not . Grab your severed arm with your other arm . Ew ... kay ... Hurray ! Good thing Scruffy rescued Leela . Don 't thank me , thank the ladder . Your cloned arms should be fully grown in a month or so . But for right now , enjoy the sounds of the world 's smallest violin . I hope you 're not too mad at me , Leela , for tearing your arm off and all . I can 't be mad . I 'm on way too many painkillers . Plus , you were willing to sacrifice yourself so I could live . I mean , you failed , miserably , but you 're the only person who loves me enough to try . One last foolish gesture ? - Uh ... - Mm . Mmm ...

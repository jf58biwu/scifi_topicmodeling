 My son is going to be responsible for the end of the world . We have to get Peter . Previously on Fringe : This technology has a very recognizable design . This is William 's technology , but we didn 't build it . - Peter is in danger . Help us cross over . - We don 't have a way to cross over but you do . NICK : We made it . We 're on the other side . ELIZABETH : Peter . I 've missed you so much . Your father 's so pleased to see you . He asked me to give you this . This is your team ? LEE : Agents Francis and Dunham . I understand you 're investigating a Fringe event ? LEE : That 's correct , sir . I believe these invaders are anything but peaceful . They must be found . Run ! Run ! Run ! Hey ! Hello , Olivia . Walter is in trouble , and I 'm quite confident we don 't have much time . COMPUTER : The Grand Hotel . Designed by Antonio Gaudi , built in 1908 . The Long Island Triangle . Fringe event 2461 . A semipermanent thin spot formed in 1990 . Temporal and spatial distortions are present . This area is off limits . Midtown quarantine . Fringe event 89722 . An unstable wormhole at the Madison Square Garden that would not close was quarantined by Fringe Division in 1999 . Due to recent legal developments , the 10,000 citizens encased in quarantine amber have been recently ruled legally dead . Liberty Island . Appropriated by the Revised Eminent Domain provision of the Earth Protection Act in 1989 . Now headquarters of the Department of Defense . Mr. Secretary . - You said anything odd , sir . - Yes . Sir , Homeland Security received a report of a high-priority individual being admitted into the E.R. At New York General Hospital . Who ? That 's the odd part , sir . It 's you . Science fiction Double feature It 's Sunday . Day off . Afraid not . I 'm uploading your assignment now . COL . Team 's on the way . We 'll get them , sir . Quickly and quietly . Mr. Secretary . Hello , son . I 've imagined this moment so many times . I can 't imagine how strange it must be for you . I 've seen strange . This ... This is something else . The last hospital before the park . If we don 't find Walter , we 'll start uptown . How do you know he 's not in custody ? I checked with my sources . I don 't believe Walternate 's people have found him . - Walternate ? It 's a nickname Walter gave him years ago , " Walternate . " He 's the Secretary of Defense . The Fringe team answers to him . To Walter ? I know . It takes a little getting used to , doesn 't it ? - Excuse me ... - How big were the bees ? This big ? - Bigger than a grapefruit ? - Uh , excuse me . Hey , pal , if you ain 't bleeding , back of the line . Excuse me , sir . I didn 't realize . That 's quite all right . I believe a friend of mine is being treated here . NURSE : What 's the patient 's name , please ? - Bell . NURSE : Sir ? You go . I 'll buy you some time . You find Walter . I 'll meet you in the parking lot . I 'm sorry . A misunderstanding . NURSE : Give me a second , I 'll find him . We 're also gonna need his medical files purged from the system . Fringe authorization . - I 've purged his file . He 's in bed 18 . - Thanks . Excuse me . Excuse me , don 't I know you from somewhere ? Uh , I have it . You 're agents . Fringe Division . You work for the Secretary . - We 're in a bit of a rush . - I imagine you would be . Chaotic times , aren 't they ? Chaotic times indeed . I 'm terribly sorry . The Secretary and I are old friends . I 'm William Bell . I see you 're carrying the 76 pulse sidearms . I designed those , you know ? - Uh , I 'm sorry , Mr. Bell , but we have to ... The 76 models don 't have the phase repeater . That 's a design flaw . Walter . - Olivia . It 's you , isn 't it ? Yes , Walter . - Prove it . - Come on , Walter . - We don 't have time for this . - Ah . - Yes , it is you . That 's wonderful . Hi . - Hi . They also don 't have the pulse function , which I am putting in the 77 . Excuse me , sir . Okay . Walter , can you walk ? - I can dance , if you like . - Okay . They have absolutely fabulous drugs here , Olivia . I feel great . Oh , and look , look , accelerated healing techniques . It 's miraculous . Okay , come on , Walter . Bell 's waiting for us . - Belly 's here ? - Yes . Yes , he is . Nice of him to finally show up . FRANCIS : Here . Clothes are gone . - He was wounded . - I 'll lock down the hospital . - Are you looking for something ? - I need the security footage for this unit . - Hello , William . - Walter . - I see you 've aged . - It appears I 'm not the only one . Get in , Walter . Hey . You okay ? It looks like you just saw a ghost . Thank you . - What 's the red ? - It notes the quarantine areas . Boston ? Almost all of it . Because of what that man did . The man who stole you . That 's a lot of blame to place on just one man . It 's true , I 'm afraid . When our two universes first interacted it caused soft spots on the other side . But it was much worse here . The laws of physics were turned into mere suggestions . But I 'm hoping you can change all that . Well , I don 't know what you 've heard about me but changing the laws of physics might be slightly above my abilities . That 's fair enough . But there have been breakthroughs on the other side in science and engineering that we haven 't achieved yet . These are things that you understand . - The schematic I left with your mother . - Yeah , I looked at them and whatever it is , it 's unlike anything I 've ever seen before . So , what is it ? It 's very old tech . It 's something that I believe can be applied to heal the problems of this world . Of your world . I 've replaced missing parts with new equipment but unfortunately , it still doesn 't work . My engineers tell me that the problem probably lies in the power source . I was hoping that you would have a look at it . Of course I will . Peter , I know it wasn 't easy . Making the choice to come home . But I 'm very glad you did . Agent Dunham is here . She doesn 't have an appointment . - Tell her ... - Olivia 's here ? Send her in . Agent Dunham . Sir . - This is Peter . - Sir . Thank you , major . Do I have something in my teeth ? No , you remind me of somebody I know . But your hair is different . I think I like yours better . Would you excuse us please , Peter ? I need to speak to Agent Dunham . I 'll be out in a moment to show you around . Agent . Uh , we lost him at the hospital , sir . - He had help escaping . - That 's not why you 're here , is it ? - Uh , no . - I told you there would be invaders from the other side . I didn 't tell you they would be us . No , you did not . They 're our doubles . Alternate versions of ourselves . But don 't be deceived , Olivia . They 're monsters in our skin . They 'll do anything , say anything to gain our trust , but they can 't be trusted . That man . He knows me . Or her . That 's why he was staring at me . Is he from the other side ? That man is my son , Peter . You son who was kidnapped 20 years ago ? Yes . Kidnapped by them . Agent may I ask a favor of you ? They had cameras everywhere . We must be on the hospital surveillance tapes . Which means we are fugitives . Double breaded for a big crunch . It 's so good . Tastes just like on our side . It was Wednesday , 1983 and I happened to identify the last of the 11 secret herbs and spices . Walter . Okay . I think that we should split up . I can look for Peter faster if I 'm on my own . - We have a larger problem . Without Mr. Lane and the others , we won 't be able to cross back to our side . Olivia can still open the door . That 's her gift , is it not ? I don 't know how much of a toll crossing over took on her . You may be able to open a crack but without the others to enhance your power ... - That 's it then . - What ? We need a doorstop . Something to hold the door open where Olivia has already provided a crack . - You could build one , Walter . - A doorstop ? No . No , no , no . I 'd need a particle accelerator . I don 't think they sell those at the local drug store . - No but I think I know where we could get one . Oh . Ha , ha . Of course . I 'm sure you opened Massive Dynamic on this side as well . As a matter of fact , I did not ... To get rich and famous while I was rotting away in a cell . Walter , will you please give it a rest . - Hey . You can work this out another time . Okay , Walter , you build a doorstop if you can . I 'm gonna go look for Peter . Do you have a cell phone ? They monitor all the communications networks . That 's probably how they knew about Central Park . It 's safest if we don 't try to communicate with one another . We 'll meet back at the opera house in 12 hours . Be careful . We 've accomplished a lot together , Walter but she may be our greatest achievement . Mm . The Secretary thinks you 'll be comfortable here . Thanks . So , uh , it 's UV-proof glass , uh , state of the art anti-fire tech . There 's viral purging , air filtration and there 's a gym and a pool upstairs . The Secretary is gonna send a car to pick you up at 8 , take you to dinner . What was it like on the other side ? The Secretary told me . A lot like it is here . Just slightly different . Subtle , but definitely different . You know , when people find out that you 're back you 're gonna be famous . - What do you mean ? - Well , your kidnapping . It 's a famous story . - So I 'm like the Lindbergh baby ? - The what ? Nothing . What 's she like ? Who ? Me . She 's a lot like you . Darker in the eyes , maybe . She 's always trying to make up for something . Right some imaginary wrong . Haunted , I guess . Maybe she 's nothing like you at all , huh ? Thanks for the ride . Of course . Am I responsible for this ? Yes , Walter . I 'm afraid you are . Of course . At one time Walternate was intent on finding a means to cross between universes just as you were . He didn 't succeed , but it stands to reason the technology we need might be here . Didn 't Walternate work with you or , rather , the William Bell from this side ? Walternate ? No . It seems that William Bell on this side was killed in a car accident as a young man . Over here , the other you and the other me never had occasion to meet . - What a shame . Imagine how much money you could have made if there were two of you . Creating Massive Dynamic was not my idea , Walter . We both talked about borrowing this world 's technologies to help our own . You didn 't help the world , William . You helped yourself . - You pilfered this world for profit . - As a byproduct , yes . Let 's remember the only reason I came back over here was to prevent a war , and to stop a chain of events set into motion the day you stole Peter . A little truth , if you please . You say you want to prevent the war while you quietly fuel it . I know that you helped craft the shape-shifters . Your design signature is all over it . I had little choice . If I wanted to keep tabs on Walternate , I had to remain valuable to him . I 've lost 1 7 years in a mental institution , William . Seventeen years . And even now , I 'm still incomplete . I forget things . Uh , names , places . Connections that I used to be able to make so easily they just dangle just outside of my reach . I know what you did to me . I know that you cut out pieces of my brain . - Walter ... - What kind of man could do that ? You robbed me of my memories ! Of my wife ! Of my son ! Of my past ! Walter . I believe you 've found what we 're looking for . We should get started . - How did ? - We leave our hide-a-key in the same place . This should do . With some modifications , this should act as a doorstop . Yes . Now , we need to simultaneously amplify and limit the molecular destabilization margins . Well , we should try not to electrocute everyone in the process . This will re-open the crack in the door . But without the others , I 'm not sure that Olivia will be strong enough to keep it open . Well , leave that to me . I need your help . Well , you have a funny way of asking . Okay , I need you to take me to Peter Bishop . I assume that you know where he is . Don 't . Uh , it 's getting heavy . Is that Mom ? Yeah . She 's alive ? What is she like ? Well , the last few years have been hard for her . My sister died during childbirth . You have a sister too ? And a niece . Ella . She 's 7 . Ella . I need to speak to Peter Bishop . He 's in danger here , and he needs to understand that . This isn 't just an assignment , is it ? Are you two a couple ? Is that what this is about ? Please , I need to speak to him . You gotta trust me . I 'm you . - You haven 't answered my question . - What question ? Why did you remove my memories ? - I had my reasons . - Belly ... Walter , let the past be the past . We have less than four hours to get back . We should go . Will you help me ? Okay . Okay . Stop . Stop . - I was just getting my keys . - Put it down . You keep your backup gun in your purse , don 't you ? I keep mine in my jacket . Now put your gun slowly down on the table . I thought we had an agreement . You know , I don 't know what you are , but you are nothing like me . You know , he was right . Call Fringe . This is Dunham . FRANCIS : Hey , Liv . Tried your cuff a couple times . Everything okay ? Yeah . What 's up , Charlie ? Got a power surge at the Secretary 's old lab . So Broyles wants us to go and check it out . You sure you 're okay ? The Secretary just called . He , uh ... He wants us to move Peter Bishop . - Apparently , he 's not safe where he is . - They found Peter Bishop ? Yeah . FRANCIS : Huh . Object is totally unresponsive . But there 's nothing wrong with it . There 's no obvious damage to the structure , and yet somehow it just feels incomplete . All right , this is gonna sound crazy . In fact this is kind of crazy , but what if the object was symbiotic in nature ? Which is to say , that it wasn 't entirely mechanical . That it needed some sort of ... Some sort of organic interface . FRANCIS : So how much do you know ? How did they find him ? I don 't know . Wow . After all these years . Can you imagine when the tabloids get ahold of this ? I think he has something to do with why people have come from the other side . Yeah , I suppose so . - We got any new leads ? - No . Nothing new . I gotta tell you , Livvy , this job isn 't what it was 10 years ago . Alternate universes . That just wasn 't part of my training , you know ? I mean , how are we supposed to fight these people ? Truth is , Livvy , this makes me feel obsolete , you know ? The parameters are human , a reflection of the human genome . The spectrum isn 't random . The specificity of the configuration would suggest that the object would only respond to a subset of people . And a narrow subset at that . A subset of one . Me . - Charlie Francis . - Peter Bishop . It 's a pleasure to meet you . Come on in . What can I do for you guys ? - Uh , we 're concerned for your safety . - What 's this ? This was given to me by an acquaintance of your father . An Observer . - An Observer ? - He gave it to me to warn me about what would happen to you if you returned here . FRANCIS : What 's going on ? - Your friends are here . They have come to keep you safe . FRANCIS : Liv , what the hell are you talking about ? - Peter , it 's me . - Thanks . I think I just figured that out . He lied to me . He told me that I could heal the problems of this world . My father told me all the problems out there started when Walter came over and stole me . And now that I was back , I was gonna be able to help to fix it . But his bringing me back was never about fixing this universe . It was about destroying yours . I 'm sorry . How long did you know ? A few weeks . - Peter , I ... - Don 't worry . I 'm not gonna let him do this . Well , I don 't think that he can . I mean , not without you . Peter . You don 't belong here . No , I don 't belong here . But I don 't belong there either . Yes , you do . I have thought of a hundred reasons why you should come back . To fight the shape-shifters , to take care of Walter to save the world . But in the end ... You have to come back . Because you belong with me . Colonel Broyles . Listen up , I need everyone 's attention now . - Mr. Secretary . - I want all surveillance retasked to find a fugitive . - What fugitive , sir ? Me . I 've got her . Her show-me just passed the checkpoint at Sector 47 . They 're heading to the opera house . People , let 's move . This is not a drill . They should be here by now . - They 'll be here . Help me get this thing inside . - Walter ! - Okay . Hello , Peter . I 'm William Bell . I haven 't seen you in many years . You 're holding up better than I would have thought . - What 's a little universe-hopping ? - That 's not what I meant . Okay , so what do we do ? Peter , help your father get this device powered up . Olivia and I will hold them off . Move , move ! I supplied Fringe Division with the 76 model . Fall back ! Fall back ! This is the 77 . Come on . Peter , I don 't even know where to begin . I never meant for any of this to happen . How do we do this , Walter ? Phosphorus grenades . Be careful . They 're prototypes , they could be unstable . - Well , what do you mean unstable ? - Just try not to jostle them . Cover me . SWAT LEADER : We move on my mark . - We 're going in two at a time . Yes , sir . Yes , Mr. Secretary . Yes , sir . COL . I understand . Damn it . Dr. Bell ! Get down ! Dr. Bell ? Can you hear me ? Dr. Bell ? - Thank God . - What happened ? I , uh ... I used a grenade . I think I bought us a few minutes . Come on . Walter , they 're here . - Is it working ? Yes . It 's opening a crack in the door . But we don 't have power to keep it open . - Yes , we can do it . - We can 't . Olivia doesn 't have power and I haven 't thought of a solution . - Walter ... - Please don 't argue with me . Not now . - Always thinking you 're smarter ... - Walter , I will be the power . I 've traveled between universes so many times my atoms are ready to split apart with the slightest provocation . You taught me there are as many atoms in the human body as there are stars in the sky . That 's how many atom bombs I am . That should be enough power to get you home . - I should never have doubted you . - It 's okay , Walter . You always were as stubborn as a donkey with a nail in his head . Walter , start the sequence . Thank you , old friend . Walter , you asked me why I took out part of your brain . I did it because you asked me to . Because of what you were becoming . Freeze ! Welcome back . Seriously ? This is the third piece , Astrid . Are you trying to kill me ? I 'm sorry . When I 'm nervous , I cook and I have been baking pies for about a week . Pies and muffins and cakes . And I 've been eating them all too . So don 't be surprised when I send you a bill for my lap band . Well , I 'm sorry I make you nervous . It 's okay . At least you 're back . Mind giving Walter a ride home ? I think I 'm gonna take a walk . Sure . Good night , Walter . Peter , you are back now , aren 't you ? You 're not leaving again ? I 'm trying to see this your way , Walter . I can 't . But you did cross universes twice to save my life . So that 's gotta count for something , right ? Thank you , Peter . My son . - Help you , gorgeous ? - I hope so . I 'm looking for a typewriter . Well , you 're in luck . A Selectric . Model 251 . I see . It 's in the back . Please let me out of here . I know you can hear me ! Please . Please let me out of here . I know you can hear me ! Please let me out of here ! No , no , no . No , no , no !

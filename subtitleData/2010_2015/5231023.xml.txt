Ooh , something tight and white . - Mmm . - What are you wearing ? Wait , no ... let me guess . Um , jeans ... Sneakers ... And that ugly striped t-shirt . Oh , my God . Ouch ! Wow . Well , hey ... the truth hurts . - I wish I could be there . - I know . Me , too . Say it . Say , " I wish you were here . " Okay . I wish you were here . Look over here . - What ? - Other way . - Hi . - Hi . You changed your hair . - Uh , yeah . I did . Do you like it ? - I like it .

" I swear the hard drive on this thing is starting to overheat . - Holy shit . - What ? She blocked me . What ? Oh , my God . Wow . - I can 't believe this is happening . - I 'm not surprised . It 's kind of a transformative year . Look at me . Come on . Look . Mmm ! - Oh , yeah . - Wearing tighter jeans doesn 't mean you 've changed . If you 're so in love with Jill , then why did you go all the way up there , - To stick your tongue in some girl 's mouth ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . It just happened . it 's like I 'm addicted to fucking up . It 's not fucking up , okay ? You were at a campus for two hours , and you were practically in a threesome . I 'm just saying , like , imagine if you spent a semester . No , no . It was a fluke . I don 't want to be with anyone but Jill . Fine . Fucking suit yourself . But I 'm just saying this summer is gonna be a very , very fertile one . All the beautiful girls that we knew at school have come back . You know , they have been broken . That 's the hardest part . And now they 're a little bit older , they 're a little bit wiser , and they are ready to put heir mouth ton any random dick that they can find . And you know what I 'm gonna do for them ? I 'm hoping to be that random Dick . Well , I wish you luck with that . I don 't need luck , man , but you might . You have been sleeping in the same bed that you 've been jerking off in since you were 12 . I mean , come on . You should have gone away to school , man . No . No . I like it here . I grew up here . I know where everything is . Wow . That ... that sounds like my grandfather , when he refused to go into assisted living . " Oh , I know where everything is . I 'm a veteran . " Grandpa , you 're not a veteran . You just watch " apocalypse now " 10 times a day . Come on . I 'm trying to help you out , man . Dude , what the fuck ? Is your dad paying the bills or what ? Bye , dad . I want to just have a summer like last summer . I mean , last summer was great , right ? That was great . Yeah , it was , but this year 's gonna be better . I promise . Not without Jill . If we don 't make up tonight , It 's over . It 's like she 's ahead of me or something . I can feel it . Well , girls mature faster . That 's all I can tell you . Wait , dude . I heard , like , angad 's parents went out of town just so he could have this party . Really ? Yeah . Like , that 's some dangerously supportive parents , man . God , you know what we should do ? We should arrive at the perfect time , right ? The facade of inhibition should be cracking right about now . Dude , I am going to get so drunk ... If Jill and I don 't make up tonight , she 's gonna go off and meet someone new ... probably some older guy who really knows how to eat pussy . You don 't know how to eat pussy ? No . I struggle with it sometimes . What ... dude , spell your name down there . - Watch . " Unh ! " - I love this girl . Stop . Can you shut up ? Holy fuck . - My boys . - Oh , eat me , angad . - Hey , dude , this is my party . - Oh , no . This is your house . - The party belongs to all of us . - No , no . It looks good , angad . It looks good ... very ... Bright . Thank you . David , dude , I spent the whole day in the lighting department at home depot . Those dudes really know their shit . So ... I have many surprises in store for us tonight . Enjoy the festivities . - Hi . - Oh , gah ! Uh , hi . Allison , what are you doing ? - Waiting for someone I don 't hate . - How 's that going ? - Been here a while . - Charlie touch your dick this year , or what ? Fucking cocksucker ! - What 's wrong , man ? - Oh , you think you 're better Than me , huh ? ! No , man ! So , you can buy drugs from me , but you can 't invite me to your fucking parties ? ! - That 's not what I said , man ! - We don 't even want to come to your fucking party ! Come on , man . Chill . People are just trying to have a good time . Ugh ! There 's Jill . Wait . Who 's she talking to ? - Hmm . I heard you fucked up . - eah . Shit . I got to talk to her . Aaah ! Aaaaah ! Dude , you went crazy , Stan . Ha ha ! I know , right ? Shaved my head . Heard you fucked up big-time , Davey . Have you seen her ? - Seen who ? - You 're an asshole . I 'm just fucking with you . She went thataway . Good luck . Chug . Chug . Chug . Chug . - Oh , it tastes so awful ! More ? Huh ? Chug ! Chug ! Chug ! Chug ! Chug ! Chug ! Chug ! Angad , what the hell is this ? Mealtime mori . It means " adoring body of a woman . " Does she hand it to me , or , like ... No , dude . It 's a body buffet . Help yourself . All right , then . Ohh . Mmm ! Thank you ! Mmm . Do you do birthdays ? Like , weddings , maybe ? Yo , dude . What the fuck are you looking at ? - Oh , hey , guys . - So , are you a peeping tom now ? - No . Uh , is Jill out there ? - Yeah . She 's blowing a line of guys . Ha ha ha ha ! David blew it with Jill . Ooh , sucks for you , man . - I just saw her in the living room . - I was just there . Well , you 're in the wrong place at the wrong time , then . - She was talking to Steve . - Uh-oh . - Wait . Who 's Steve ? - Some older dude ... great lips . Give her some space . When I was talking to her , she looked ready to kill . Whoo ! - Hey ! - Hi . - May ... may I sit ? - Yeah . Oh . Well , that 's ... that 's all I can ask for . I ... I 'm Teddy , by the way . - Melanie . - Melanie . - Nice to meet you . - You , too . Nice to meet you . - Cool . And who do you know ? - Not a lot of people . Oh , wow . - Yeah . - Is that why you 're sitting here by yourself ? So , I ... I know you 're thinking . The answer is , yes , my carpet matches my drapes . You are out of control . No . No . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm actually in complete control . Oh . See , the thing is , you think you are , but you 're not . I kind of think that you 're into me . Well , I do think you 're funny . Yeah . Yeah ? Like , funny , " ha ha , " or funny , " strange " ? What ? I mean , do you have a preference ? 'Cause I could go either way . I ... Party like fuck ! - Yeah ! Ha ha ! - Whoo ! Time to throw out the trash ! It 's about to get real cold in here ! Here we go ! - Yeah . - Yeah . Basically ... Ohhhhh ! [ Shouting in Japanese ] Craig fucking bit her ! [ Shouting in Japanese ] Wait ! Hey , no ! Come on ! What 's up , Allison ? You 've gotten all sexy since last year . Are you working out ? I ... Pace a lot . I can see you 've got a hot body , even though you cover it up . It 's called " clothing . " Why don 't we remove some of it ? If only you had opposable thumbs . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Ah . My girlfriend dared me . She 's a bitch ! - You look crazed . - Yeah . Have you seen her ? I 'm not exactly looking , no offense . Well , she was just here . She was just ... Hey , do ... do you think people ever get what they deserve ? Well , if they do , Allison ... If they do , you 're gonna be a very happy person someday , okay ? You know , once in a while , you say something awesome . Mm . Every once in a while . Yeah . Thank you . Tell Jill that , please . Can you remind her ? - Oh , my God . - Okay . It 's on . Yeah ! Unh ! Unh ! Unh ! Unh ! Unh ! Unh ! F-f-fucking savages , right ? - I 've come to a conclusion . - Wait , wait , wait , wait . Hold on . Hold on . - " Conclusion " means the end of something . - No , no , no , no . No . - I have a surprise for you . - A surprise ? - I .. I .. I like surprises . - Oh , you like surprises ? Well , meet me upstairs in 10 minutes , and I 'll give it to you Where ? Uh ... Better pay attention ... Teddy . Okay . I can do that . Sorry . Watch it . I just scored my number-one draft pick . - What the hell does that mean ? - Melanie trembley ... She just ... she asked me to , like , go upstairs and says she has a surprise for me . She 's probably crawling out a window right now . Oh , wow ! Huh ! You 're gonna grow old with a lot of cats . Okay , fuck you , Teddy . You don 't even know me . Please . Can we have a moment . Yeah , how goes the Jill hunting ? Can you please do me a favor ? If you see her anywhere , you have to tell me . Yeah . Do you know what ? I 'm gonna text you , but , please dude , just ... What was that ? - No , Kyle . - Shut up . Rad . Kyle . Kyle . - Kyle ! - Fuck , Bonnie ! What ? What 's your problem ? Jill ? Aaah ! I got it ! Ugh ! Relax ! Remain calm !

For what , exactly ? You don 't even know what you 're apologizing for . - It 's not for the kiss ? - That 's only part of it , David . What 's the other part ? You made me feel replaceable . Oh , no . I could never replace you . You know , it 's not only ... it 's not only what you did . It 's who . It 's where . It 's when . It 's like you stepped into a part of my life where you didn 't belong . - I thought I belonged everywhere . - I guess you don 't . Oh , well . Your skin is so soft . And you smell so yummy . Less words . Ugh ! Ugh ! Ugh ! Ugh ! Yeah . Wha-huh ! Oh , yeah ! Go ! Yes ! Ohh ! - You like that ? - Yeah ! You like that , you little stupid fuck ? ! It 's good ! May your good health be twofold . This is a delicacy in my country . Hey , fucking come on ! I just want to forget this ever happened , okay ? I just ... I ... That is a really stupid thing to say . Jill , we 've been together a long time . - Two years really isn 't that long . - What ? No , it 's not . It 's like ... what is it ? ... 730 days , two years . It 's a long time . You 're an idiot .

I just mean , like , if we worked it out , we wouldn 't be fighting right now . We 'd be out there having fun with everyone else , but instead , we 're , like , fighting each other , you know ? Yeah . So , this is ... this is now ... this is all my fault ? No , you don 't get it . You don 't get it . It 's not your fault , and I 'm not saying it 's your fault . Just answer me one question . What do you do ? - What ? - Well , you don 't want to do anything new . All you care about is that this summer is like last summer . But what about next year ? You don 't want anything to change , including me . - Jill , come on . - What ? - I came here to apologize . - Yeah ? Well , you suck at it . You suck at it . You know what ? You were right about one thing , though . If I were out there having fun with everyone else , I wouldn 't be wasting my time on somebody who 's gonna play the same games for the rest of his life . - Like , um , Steve ? - Who ? Oh , who ? Steve ? Steven ? - Come on . I have eyes , Jill . - What are you talking about ? - I 'm talki- - - Okay . That 's where you 're gonna go with this ? That 's where you 're gonna choose to go ?

Somebody that looked just like him shot Kyle dead and ran . - Are they gonna kill us , too ? - Who knows ? - Calm down , okay ? - What should we do ? We got to figure out what 's going on . I 'm thinking something happened with the power outage . We had one earlier at my house . Guys , guys , you 're not gonna fucking believe what I just saw . I think we will . What the fuck ? Guys , everyone we know is still outside . I just saw two identical melanies in the same room . - What ? What did you do ? - Well , what ?

I mean , we 've been together for two years , which is 730 days . You know what ? This isn 't just about what you did . - It 's about ... - Where and when . Yeah . It 's like I stepped into a part of your life where I don 't belong . - Right . - Right . You did . I just wish none of this had ever happened . - Well , wishing is for little ... - Is for little children . I know . And that 's the thing . I can 't help it . This whole thing 's got me feeling like a stupid little kid . Just stop . Stop . Where did you hear that ? Where did you hear that ... that wishing is for little children ? Can you just give me another chance ? - How many chances do you get ? - I know we only get one chance . We only get one chance , and every second that passes is gone forever . - I have to ... I have to ask . - Okay , I ... I .. I just have a really weird feeling right now . No , Jill . When ... When I was watching you from the bleachers ... - What were you possibly thinking ? - I was thinking that I could barely recognize you . It 's like you 're this different person , and I .. I ... Couldn 't be sure if that person would like this person . - That doesn 't mean , David , that you go off ... - No , I felt like you were moving on , Like you were moving up in the world and I was just there . I was just ... There . I think the kiss was a really stupid , stupid way of making everything just stop so I could catch up . I understand if you want to move on . It 'll kill me , but ... I see there 's nothing else I can do . All I can do is ask for one last chance . I don 't know , David . I don 't want to stand still anymore . Jill ? Jill !

They 're ... they 're us . They 're us , but they 're not us , and something keeps happening to us when we lose power or ... - What are you talking about ? - It 's like , did they move ? when they came back , it was on the floor , right ? It was like 15 minutes later or 15 minutes closer . Closer to what ? Closer to us in time . It 's like they 're catching up to us . - But , Teddy , that is me in there . That 's me . - I just cock-blocked myself , okay ? And if he 's anything like me , he 's gonna be pissed . Who are you hiding from ? You 're a weird dude , man . David . David . Hey .

Maybe we have less to worry about than we think . - What do you mean ? - If the universe is really infinite , it means mathematically , there must be replicas of our solar system out there . You 've got to be kidding me . Look , just because they exist doesn 't mean they 're out to get us . - She 's right . - Yeah ? How do you figure ? From the book of talmud .

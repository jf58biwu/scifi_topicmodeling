 Good morning . Hrachovec . Hold on . How come you 're late ? You were supposed to be in class 10 minutes ago . - But you ... - What about me ? You 're not gonna believe me , really strong head wind was blowing today . A head wind , huh ? Scram . Paøízková . I 've read ... " The War with the Newts " . Go ahead . " The War with the Newts " is a classic allergy . Allegory ! Wikipedia , right ? That typo has been there for 3 years . You don 't read yourselves . Just copy ! Janeèková . I 've read " The Song of Victoria " . From Seifert . Yes . But you were supposed to have that one memorized for today . I know it . What if love is a flame . Don 't be lame , man . Give me some more ! Hrachovec . The assignment for today was ... Amazing . Happy to hear that . This means you certainly know the poem by heart . Please . Jaroslav Seifert " The Song of Victoria " . Janeèková , please go see the principal and inform him I 've gone deaf . Hrachovec here has been reciting for over a minute and I can 't hear a thing ! Janeèková , where are you going ? ! To go see the principal . Well , there aren 't a lot of things I wouldn 't do for you . Of course , I meant that figuratively . Sit down . OK . Stanislav Kostka Neumann . Settle down , OK ? What a masterpiece . Doubrava , wipe it off . GENERAL PARTNER present WAKING UP YESTERDAY MAIN PARTNERS WRITTEN BY CO-WRITER STARRING COSTUMES MAKE UP SET DESIGNER PROPERTY SOUND MUSIC PRODUCER EXECUTIVE PRODUCER FILM EDITOR DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY DIRECTED BY You 're not dressed yet ? Have you forgotten about it ? About what ? Bára , her birthday party . Am I supposed to call it off for the third time ? That would be so nice of you . I have to finish this . I just got an amazing idea ! Do you think this is reasonable ? This is the most reasonable thing I 've done in a year . Marie , don 't be foolish . Just yesterday everything was totally fine . Petr , you are fine . I 've been planning on leaving for the past 2 months . Come on . Let 's talk out what 's bothering you . I water the plants , the sex is great . Of course , this is the first thing that pops into your head . Kinda strange ... taking into account I don 't like plants all that much . You 're just hilarious . Sex is the first thing on your mind . But I want to live a little more ! So do I. That 's why I go to all those regular health checkups . Knock off these jokes of yours . When was the last time we went out together ? Went out ? We threw out that sofa yesterday . You never spend time with me anymore . You just sit around , don 't touch that , and tap those bullshit stories of yours into the keyboard . Take Karel for instance . Every week he takes his girlfriend Salsa dancing to a Cuban bar . I know . Because he can 't hear her through the noise there . I 'll pick up the rest of my stuff later . - Maruš ! We 'll get through this ! - Don 't call me Maruš ! Are you doing this on purpose , or what ? You know how I hate it , you ass . - Or are you trying to be funny ? ! - Wait a sec . I thought of something . Don 't go anywhere ! How did you say it ? Sex is the first thing on your mind . Great line ! Sex is the first ... This is good ! Goodbye . Marie , wait . Come on Ma ... So who is next ? Hrachovec . Have you learned the poem ? - I was feeling a little ill yesterday . - And the day before ? I was feeling quite bad that day too . So how come I saw you on your skateboard yesterday ? My doctor recommended me to spend a lot of time on fresh air . So once again you don 't know the poem . For what things do you have space for in that head , if not for poetry ? Sex . Sex ? Paøízková thinks about it too and she has the poem memorized , right ? Do you know that poetry can bring you the same pleasure as sex ? I seriously doubt that . Why don 't you give Nezval a try ? - I 'll let Paøízková try him out . - Please knock it off and sit down . You 're already seated . With your IQ , I think you know what grade I 'm about to give you , right ? Petr ! Hi . - Hi . - Are you going to lunch ? - Sure . - So am I. They 're supposed to serve schnitzels today . I can 't wait ! There were supposed to be schnitzels . Really . Laburdová said so . Don 't trust her . Laburdová is even capable of proclaiming she 's skinny . That was a joke . How are you ? How 's it going at home ? Well , I just broke up with Marie . Really ? I 'm sad to hear that . That makes two of us . At least I think so . You know what ? There 's a new movie from Høebejk in cinemas now . I know . Would you like to go see it with me ? - When ? - On Saturday ? Can 't make it . I have judo that day . OK . So Sunday then ? Anything interesting planned on Sunday ? - No , I don 't have anything on Sunday . - Great . Now you do ! Hi , mom . I 've brought some dirty laundry . Husband ! Someone dumped him again . Am I right ? But I was only off by a month . That was your fifth or sixth ? Come on ! Why 's that important ? Eighth . And the reason ? She wanted to live a little more , right ? Cough it up . I really don 't have any more . And what about some support ? Usually parents give some . Yeah ? Look . If you had stayed with Veronica , we wouldn 't be solving these problems . She was ugly . And dumb . You get used to that . I got used to it , too . What are you babbling about ? I was the prettiest girl in school . I was stupid for marrying you . Dear wife , our son needs a little encouragement . I 'll encourage him . Son , it doesn 't matter that you 're stupid . Even dumb guys get married . Is it good ? - Bon appétit . - Bon appétit . Please , explain to me , why aren 't you capable of holding on to a girl ? Some of them were really good . Pavla , for example . She was great . I even wagered 200 CZK on her . But we didn 't get along that well . You always don 't like something . We got along with her perfectly . Perfectly . Really . An invitation to your high school reunion came in the mail . I also found a couple of your high school pictures . You should go to a psychologist . I know one who works as a marriage counselor . But I 'm not married . That 's the problem . A pal of mine is a psychologist . I can go see him . You should . The sooner the better . Is there anybody new in your life now ? No , I haven 't recovered yet . Actually ... There 's Dáša from school . She invited me to see a movie . Two months . One month for a hundred . So , what do you need ? Look . Today I rather need a friend than a psychologist . Go on . What 's up ? Lately , things haven 't been working out for me . Marie left me ... Look . You 're a dreamer . You 're constantly choosing women that are pragmatic and just don 't get you . - What would you like to order ? - I 'll have one beer . I just have a feeling that I haven 't met the right girl yet . Certainly not in the last 20 years . And before that ? The best girl that I 've ever met was Eliška . In high school . But I was really dumb back then . You know what I mean . You never told her , did you ? She had no clue I was crazy about her . I never mustered up enough courage to tell her how I truly felt . And then , she suddenly disappeared somewhere . She was really amazing . So , go find her . Oh , please . I bet she 's married now . Has 10 kids . Maybe not . You think ? - Hi . - Kováø . Hey ! Do you know if Eliška will be coming ? Nice to see you , too . - Hi , girls . - Hi , ladies . Here we are . Hey , Kvìta ! - Hi . - So how have you been ? - I 'm after yet another break up . - Hi . Another break up ? Look at me and Zuzanka . - We 're together since high school . - Really ? I 've loved him since my freshman year . But it took you ages to notice me . - Do you know if Eliška has arrived ? - I doubt it . Hi . Ask Kvìta . They were inseparable back then . Kvìta , do you know if Eliška is coming ? Hardly . She 's never shown up here . And ever since she 's moved away , we aren 't in touch . You 're still thinking about Eliška ? Let it go . The important thing is we have Pepík Perèa here . - Do you know he 's the CEO of Eurobank ? - No . Who would have guessed that back then ? Guys , you can 't imagine how much I would like to return to high school . Be happy it 's behind us . I would give anything to go back ... My grandpa used to say that brewers make beer , but innkeepers perfect it . Thanks . - Aleš . - Yeah ? Come dance with me . Come on . - One moment . - Go on then . Zuzana must have some kind of radar . Pepa ? Eliška ? Don 't know her . But I might have a proposition for you . My sis works in a research facility and they 're always looking for nuts like you . The summer vacation is coming up , you 're gonna have lots of time . Definitely give her a call . Cheers . Cheers . - Good afternoon . - Hello . What can I do for you ? My name is Kováø . Yesterday , I spoke with Dr. Prubner about the experiment . Dr. Prubner is in his office . It is quite simple , Mr. Kováø . Thanks to literature and sci-fi films you certainly are familiar with someone boarding a rocket , and travelling back to the 15th century or prehistoric times . This we , unfortunately , still cannot do . But we 're successful in travelling on a timeline of a person 's life . Let 's say you would like to return to the time you were 12 years old . - 18 . - Very well . When you were 18 . We will send your current consciousness back in time to your 18 year old body . For how long do you wish to stay in the past ? For about a month . I must admit that 's a little surprising . You 're the first person to travel back in time for such a long period . I must congratulate you ! So this means I 'm kind of a lab rat here ! Come on . Into what time period will you be travelling ? I would prefer June 1989 . Back then I was in my 3rd year of high school . To ensure your safety , it would be best if you could read this manual . Luckily for you , it 's not a very extensive one . Watch where you 're going , dumbass ! You watch where you 're going , Hrachovec . - Sorry . - Hurray ! Summer break ! Calm down a little ! Finally , the break is here . Please , please come on in . So let 's do a little recap here . You 'll travel back in time to 1 st June . Therefore on 30th June , at midnight , you must be unconditionally at home in bed , ready to be transported back . If you fail to be there the consequences could be fatal . Can you be more specific ? In the best-case scenario you might suffer severe brain damage . And I also have to warn you that you might experience problems such as memory loss before your brain fully acclimatizes after time travel . Please go ahead and assume your position . Go on . I envy him so much . Three , two , one ... start ! Gerta ! I remember her . So this is what I looked like . Why are you staring at yourself in the mirror , like that ? I 'm not staring . What an idiot . Why are you gaping at that roll , like that ? He 's been acting like an idiot since morning . He spent a whole our staring at himself in the mirror . I should have quit jogging during pregnancy . Running was pretty much OK . The drinking though ... not so much . What are you talking about ? I never drank more than one glass . Well here are the results . Perfect breakfast . What would you like ? Give me a sec . Where 's my allowance money ? Gottwald . Cool . Do you have " The Red Law " ? Of course . " The Red Law " . The Red . " The Young World " , " The Free Word " , " People 's Defense " and " The Porcupine " . The Red , Free , Porcupine . What are you looking at ? Hey . Aleš ! Really nice to see you , man . But you see me every day . Right . - Did you bring me the tape ? - What tape ? The one you promised to bring yesterday ! I did ? Come on . What are you staring at ? Who will solve this trivial equation ? Kováø , come up to the board . Me ? We actually have tests here in school . What a surprise , isn 't it ? But I wasn 't expecting to be tested . Today . Of course . Ideally I should inform you two days in advance . To the board and get started . Find out if that equation expresses a circle . What seems to be the problem ? We have been over this a week ago . That 's the problem . Could you give me a clue ? You 're not in some TV game show to be receiving clues . But I will give you some advice . Solve the equation or get an F. Great clue ! Kováø , come up to the board ! Your grade is between an A and B. So come up here . I 'm actually perfectly fine with a B , professor . Let 's parse the sentence : " Kagda ja byl na vagzale " . Write down " Kagda ja byl na vagzale " . Kováø ! I 've tested you quite recently and you did well . But now it looks as if you have seen the Cyrillic alphabet for the first time ! Kováø ! Please recite the Cyrillic alphabet aloud . A , B ... C , D. Go to your seat . You are definitely not getting an A or B but a C. And you can be sure I 'll be watching you . Let 's discuss the significance of our alliance with the Soviet Union . The Soviets have offered us help on numerous occasions . Even though not everyone expressed appreciation for their efforts . Am I correct , Miss Rybanská ? For example during the Munich betrayal , during the liberation . In the year 1947 . And then , of course , in 1968 . Ever since the Soviet armies have been securing the stability in our society , and will continue to do so in the future . This is too much . Kováø ! What is so amusing ? Nothing . What made you laugh then ? You can tell us . Actually , everything that you 've just said . You 'll be needing this for the rest of your life . Be careful so you don 't run into trouble . A pop quiz will settle you down . Everyone ! Take out a sheet of paper . Are you dumb ? Why are you provoking him ? - Enter . - Hello , sir ... comrade professor . I was told to go see you . Yes . Take these books and come with me . Excuse me . What the hell were you doing today during social studies ? Colleague Mraznièka demands for me to take action . Allegedly , you were voicing antisocialist opinions in class ! I was only speaking my mind . That 's the problem . You can 't talk like this in public , in cafés , train stations . In school . So we understand each other . If you ever want to talk , come see me . Otherwise keep your mouth shut . Understand ? I do . Darn . I forgot the keys to the library . What 're we going to do ? I guess we just take these back . Vrchlický drew inspiration from Hugo and his " Legend of the Ages " . Stay awake ! Vrchlický ' s goal was to write a poetic cycle , which would capture the spiritual history of mankind . It was named " Fragments of an Epic " . Kováø ! Am I disturbing you from something ? No . Not at all . - Then I 'm boring you . - No . Well , you can give us a lecture on Vrchlický yourself . Please go ahead . The class is yours . Vrchlický ' s creativity derived from his deep feelings for Ms. Podlipská . Even though she was 20 years older than him , they got along perfectly . However , she resisted to commit to the relationship because of the era 's judgmental morality . She decided to arrange a marriage between Vrchlický and her daughter Ludmila , which was a mistake from the very beginning . Why was that a mistake ? Ludmila was a simple woman . Sofie Podlipská was quite the opposite . She was an educated , smart woman and she understood Vrchlický in everything . Very well . These were Vrchlický ' s troubles with women . Now let 's concentrate on his poetry . His first collection was " The Spirit and the World " and others followed such as " Gods People " , " Votive Desks " , " Frescos Tapestries " . In the collection " Windows in a Storm " we can find the famous poem " For a little love I would walk to Earth 's end . " I would walk with my head down . Bare , bare . Bare and would walk barefoot . I would walk over ice but feel May in my soul . I would walk in a blizzard but always hear blackbirds sing . This hasn 't happened to me yet . I must admit I wasn 't bored at all , colleague . So have you really read Vrchlický ? Not everything . Only about 30 volumes . That poem was really nice . That thing you pulled with Vrchlický was great . - I think so , too . - Great joke . Hi , guys . Hi . What do you think of Zuzka ? Zuzka ? She 's a fine girl . - Is she dating anyone now ? - I dunno . How am I supposed to know ? Look at Benda from the " B " class . He has a great jacket from Tuzex . Handsome ! Dad ? These are the only decent clothes I own . You want to go to school looking like this ? I have nothing else to wear . I wanted to ask you if you could lend me some money . A larger sum . I bet a girl is involved in this . Will you lend me some ? So a girl is involved . Well , that means I have to help you . When will you pay me back ? Maybe I 'll win the lotto . I seriously doubt that . I have been betting for 25 years and still nothing . Look . If you don 't pay me back by the end of the month , you 'll work in the workshop for free . At least I won 't be forced to look for part-timers . Sure . Thanks . Do you want some Tuzex vouchers ? - For how much ? - 500 . Come here . Where are you ? - Eliška ? - What ? Hi . - What are you doing here ? - It 's Waldemar . - Waldemar ? - My rabbit ran away . Your rabbit ? Where is it ? I 'm not sure . Somewhere over there . I 'm an expert in catching rabbits . Waldemar , come here ! Bunny ... I 'll rip you in half ! Are you crazy ? Some young generation we have today ! Unbelievable ! Waldermar , don 't spoil it to me ! You bastard ! Gotcha ! Waldemar ! Come on . Get up ! Oh , crap ! He ran away . Oh , man ! Maybe he 'll come back . I doubt it . Such a shame it was Walda . Damn ! He 'll come back . You have to trust me . Rabbits like that always come back . Good rabbits . Would you like to go see a movie with me ? - I can 't . - I don 't mean now or today . We can go some other time . Tomorrow maybe ? - I really can 't . I have a boyfriend . - No , you don 't . I do . Roman Perlík . Thanks , but no . See you . Perlík from class " B " . I totally forgot . Wife . Come here . Look . He 's sitting and staring like a calf into a manger . Maybe something is troubling him . What kind of problems might he have ? I never had any in his age . Really ? And what about when we had sex for the first time ? Why are you bringing up stuff like that ? Could you please leave me alone ? I 'm trying to cope with a broken heart here . So that investment didn 't work out . I could have saved that money . So he has fallen in love and was rejected . This has to be dealt with in a radical manner . - Go take out the trash ! - Come on . Ease up on ... When was the last time you took out the trash ? Be off with it right now ! This room is such a mess . We 're leaving for the cottage soon so don 't leave any trash lying around . Hi . Petr ? What are you doing here ? I 'm uh ... drinking ... thinking about life . I can see that . Come on . I 'll make you some coffee . I 'm kinda comfortable over here . Come with me . My folks are working the night shifts . OK then . Let 's go slowly . Have you ever liked someone but that person didn 't care even one bit ? Actually I have the same problem . And that person doesn 't suspect a thing . I really thought it would work . And instead she is dating such a loser . He has 3 kids , is divorced 3 times , doesn 't pay alimony , has debts all over . And you know what ? He drinks . I 'm really unlucky when it comes to love as well . I 'm starting to think it 's never going to change . But it will . You 'll have a husband . Three kids . Why don 't you tell me his name while you 're at it ? Dominik Pouzar . You 're really not sober . I 'm sorry but I can 't go on . Don 't worry about it . This happens to guys all the time . No . I don 't mean that . Did you get that I was talking about you in the living room ? In the living room ? No . But I love somebody else you know . - Do I know her ? - Eliška . I think I should go . Thanks for the coffee . It was great . Jesus . So you didn 't know . Big deal . That 's it . I didn 't know . You couldn 't have known that . A person can 't know everything . That 's exactly it . No one tells anyone anything here . You have no clue who 's dating who . You don 't know who likes who . And then you end up wasting 20 years of your life . Damn ! Everything could 've been different . How do you say face in Russian ? Lico . And book ? Kniga . Let 's go . Please write this in my status : Love and peace . Why don 't you write it yourself . Take it . Have fun . This is really good . How did you come up with that ? It just hit me . Don 't kid yourselves . Such hi-tech equipment wasn 't around before . Put together a development diagram and write a program for the selection of one out of three elements . Petr ! You don 't know what to do or what 's going on ? Maybe if I had Windows ... First , prove to us that you can work with Basic and then you can brag all you want about those widows or whatever . Why are you laughing ? Are you laughing at me ? I would tell you but you might get offended . That ship has sailed . Get out of here and calm down outside . Windows ... Why would he need those for working with a computer ? I will once again repeat today 's lotto numbers : 8 , 14 , 20 , 28 , 34 and 36 . The draw is now over . Damn it ! I 'm not doing this anymore . I 'm done . No more betting . It 's like flushing money down the toilet . Never more . Never ! I 'll bet you 10 crowns he won 't last . I 'm going out . Petr . Stop by the post office tomorrow . Here are the numbers and money . This is my last bet . I don 't have the nerves for it anymore . I 'm ... observing people here . Here ? ! Here . Why are you observing them ? Because I like people a lot . So do I. What 's so funny , young man ? Your ID . Move it . Occupation ? I 'm a student . Student ? What are you doing over here , student ? Shouldn 't you be in school studying instead of crouching behind trashcans ? We now have a new assignment which involves watching policemen at work . I guess that is for your classes in social studies . No , for zoology . Everything is in order , comrade . - Kvìta . - I 'd like to become a fashion designer . Owner of a second hand shop . Pepa Perèa . I don 't know . I 'll see . Something involving numbers , I guess . CEO of Eurobank . Zuzanka . I 'd like a job in healthcare . A doctor , I guess . Manager at McDonald 's . - Pavel . - I will drive a truck for a living . A sewage truck , my friend . Radovan . Radovan ! Excuse me . I 'm sorry . Excuse me , Mr. Krejèíø . Am I disturbing you ? No . What do you want to be when you grow up ? A millionaire ? Well , taking into account you 've flunked 3 times your goals are set quite high . - Eliška . - I would like to become a veterinarian . - Aleš . - I would like to become an actor . I think you are one already . What about Petr ? I 'll try to get in the School of Performing Arts , but won 't be accepted . So , I will study Czech and history at the Philosophical faculty instead . I 'll become a high school teacher . Because of the lack of teachers , I 'll be forced to teach biology and PC classes . I 'll also write a couple of books . The better ones won 't be interesting for anyone and the worse ones will sell . Really ? What else ? I 'll also live a life full of mistakes and unsuccessful relationships . And I 'll lose my virginity at the age of 20 . She 's sleepy and walking down the street . She cannot stop loving ... Here . Have a drink ! Dreams that smell of cinnamon you can 't wrap your arms around ... You must have a lot of talent for playing that well off key ? Fine . Why do I even bother trying ? You play it . Great . May I ? - You play the guitar ? - Yeah . A little . When I 'll wake up tomorrow morning and again tell myself never more . You 'll have every right to laugh at me . - I don 't know this one . - I guess Petr wrote it himself . How to pardon my weaknesses , hatred and anger when I am the cause of it all . You make the bed you lie in . May I ? That was really good how you played . Only I didn 't know the song very well . I had no idea you play the guitar . I do . And could you maybe play something more common ? Sure . And what about that movie ? Are we still going ? Kováø ! You 're sitting in a wrong spot . Beat it . Thanks . Why did you ask me about Zuzana last time ? You really don 't know ? She 's crazy about you . Ever since freshman year . - What ? - Yeah . You just haven 't noticed it yet . Zuzka ? Where do you know this from ? I 'll tell you one day . You must do something for me , though . What should I do ? Could you get me a rabbit ? You 're crazy . Thanks . Let 's go , guys . Come on ! Just so everything is clear between us . Stop hanging out with Eliška ! Do you understand ? Roman . When I look at you from a distance , you look like an idiot . And when I take a look at you from up close , I 'm only more certain it 's true . Let 's see how long you 'll keep up those jokes , you asshole . Is this yours ? Good stuff . Are you used to bringing cakes to school ? Today 's an exception . I brought it in for lab classes . We 're gonna be studying mould . Religion is a manifestation of an idealistic view of the world . Hrabavá ! Which are the biggest socialistic countries in the world ? U.S.S.R. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or China . Kováø ! What did I just say ? Orchina . Silence ! Orchina . Are you making fun of me ? What are the key traits of capitalism ? Restitution , privatization , entrepreneurship , unemployment , pornography . - Cyclical economical crises . - Very good . - Freedom of speech . - That 's enough . Mikulík . Do you really mean it ? Could you please explain it to me ? I explained it to you 3 times already ! Well , you can do it again . I guess I still don 't get it . I thought that we would be able to break up calmly . May I ? Sure . I still have your flowers at home . They still smell nice . Yeah ? That invitation to go see a movie is still on ? Sure . It still is . But only for the upcoming 5 seconds . Fine . But don 't be expecting anything . No . Of course not . It 'll be like a meeting between friends . Absolutely . Hi . Sorry I 'm late . - You look very nice . - Thank you . What are we going to see ? I had no idea it would be so hard to pick a movie . They 're only playing Russian films . That 's OK . At least we 'll have the cinema all to ourselves . I 've picked " Dirty Dancing " , so the place probably will be packed . - Are we gonna go in ? - Let 's go . You are already good in that , so let 's try something else . I 'm gonna turn around , you 'll catch me and then there 'll be a backbend . OK . The third thing is the backbend . So , now let 's do it in speed . One , two , three . One , two . You said the backbend is supposed to be on the third beat is . Sorry . On the third beat . Now the steps . Are you ready ? And chasse , chasse . Repeat it after me . Chasse ... Not the words but the steps . Come on . So - chasse ... You 're getting good at this . Nice ! - Chasse . - Chasse . Spin move . I have an idea . Let 's go dancing . I have to be home by eleven . We 'll make it . Heeey ! If you think I 'm gonna go upstairs with you after the very first date , you are veeery wrong . I 'm not that type of guy . That is absolutely understandable . We shouldn 't rush into things . Exactly . I would lose all my self respect after that . That dancing really exhausted you , didn 't it ? Little girl , I 'm not the youngest guy around anymore . And every minute spent with you is really demanding . Every one is worth it , though . Do I have a chance of getting any more of these highly demanding minutes ? If you keep surprising me like this , why not ? Lately you have been totally different . Certainly not as boring as before . I used to be boring ? Actually , yes . But nowadays you are doing quite well . Except for the fact you didn 't catch the rabbit . - Goodnight . - Goodnight ! That stupid rabbit ! I 'm waiting , Rybanská . Who stands at the head of the Federal Assembly ? Sit down . You 're getting a C. You should follow politics more closely . Differently than your father though . If you want to study at the university . Comrade professor . Yes ? I think that what you 're doing is not very fair . Well , since you spoke up yourself I 'm going to test you as well . Who 's the General Secretary of the Communist Central Committee ? - Kováø . I am waiting ! - I don 't remember them very well anymore . Isn 't this question pointless , though ? when all will change in 6 months ? So , we now have a prophet in class . And a false one , too . - Oh , aren 't you in for a surprise . - Sit down ! We 'll discuss this in my office after class . Comrade professor ? Kováø , what did you mean by those words in class ? Are you mocking me ? - No . - Take a seat . So , what 's going to happen in half a year ? A revolution . You mean a revolution in the class ? No . Against the ... a student revolution in fact . The Party would never allow such a thing to happen . It will eventually step down voluntarily . And what will become of the communists ? Nothing major really . Actually , lots of them will do quite well . If you 're so smart then tell me this - what will become of me ? You , comrade professor , will become the school principal . That 's enough ! Get out ! I will have you expelled ! - What did he want ? - He was just trying to scare me . I want to tell you something , too . Come with me . Please follow me . Now we are standing in front of the most precious painting in the chateaux . It depicts the knight Adam of Polžice and Bezdružice . After you take a good look at it , we 'll visit the quarters of the local prince . When this knight Adam left to fight in a war his countess Blanka promised him she would wait for his return . However , he fell in battle and once she found out , she died of grief . How come you know all this ? I already told you , I 'm gonna be a history teacher . And what will I be doing after high school ? That is something I don 't know . That makes two of us . All I know is that my parents and I are moving away during the summer break . Now think of something really nice . Like me , for example . I don 't think of anything else , anyway . Fine . But all we 're gonna be doing is lying on the ground and looking up . That one looks like two hills . - More like two tits . - No way . Yes way . - And that one resembles a crocodile . - That is a classic strudel . No . It 's definitely a crocodile . If you mean that over there , then that is definitely a strudel . And if it is a crocodile , then it must have been in a car accident . You have taken me to see a chateau . Now I will take you someplace too . There they are . What 's wrong , Pepa Perèa ? I 'm sorry but I wasn 't able to prepare myself for class today . We recently had a death in our family . - Who died ? - Our hamster . Look . If you come to a class unprepared , admit it at its start . OK ? - Yes ? - Hello . - Hello . My name is Hamster . I 'm a school inspector . Hello . Please , pardon me for the intrusion , comrade professor . I will take a seat in the back . Proceed as if I were not here . Let 's continue with Czech drama . We 'll discuss Èapek and Nezval . Èapek or Nezval . I do not want to interfere much , dear colleague . However , I 'm mostly interested in mandatory literature . We have the pre-exam period now . I 'm sure students have read all of it . What about Marlen Jeøábková ? Marlen Jeøábková ? Yes ... So you were supposed to read a novel about Marlen Jeøábková . Kováø . What is it about ? She founded an agricultural community in the 1950s . Tell us what Marlen Jeøábková 's novel is about . In the novel the author recollects how she had founded an agricultural community in the 1950s . - Excuse me , colleague . - Yes ? I will just step in for a brief moment . And refresh what it 's like sitting behind this desk . So , you 're saying the book takes place in the 50s . The author 's recollections are from a specific year . Which one ? 1950 . - No . - 1951 . - No . - 1952 ? - No . - 1953 ? Who helped her found the community ? Friends . Naturally . They were comrades , friends . But , most importantly , she received help from the chairman of the local communist ... Very well . Could you tell me his name ? - It has just slipped my mind . - I can wait . Excuse me , comrade inspector . He had the same name as that actor who plays in the movie " A Friend for a Rainy Day " . Not Tofi . Vaculík . Before the author founded the community , what was her occupation ? She confiscated cows . She campaigned ! - Did she do so alone ? - No . She did it with Vaculík . - I mean the campaigning . - Please ignore your classmates . She did it only with Vaculík ? No . She did it with everyone in the community . Concentrate , Kováø . The draught was a serious problem back then . She had to ask for help . Who did she ask ? - Vaculík . - The Soviet Union ! When it comes to mandatory literature , I 'll have to write an official report . Comrade inspector ? Yes ? I believe that woman had a tough life . And it 's hard for men to comprehend that . You know what I mean . I knew her personally . She was an extraordinary woman . I mean comrade . What is your name ? Rybanská . I will remember you . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . I have to write that report now . Rybanská ? Goodbye . That 's that 18 year-old from Kladno . Jágr . This guy is gonna be the best hockey player in the world ... - You didn 't understand me , asshole ? ! - Roman ! Please ! - You be quiet ! I wouldn 't do this if I were you . Why ? Will you ruffle my hair ? - Roman . Stop this . I broke up with you ! - I didn 't ! You should get some treatment for that aggression of yours . You 're gonna need treatment , asshole ! Come here , you prick ! I 'm OK . Kováø ! Oh shit . Not only that he fights in front of school like an idiot . He 's also telling everyone there will be a revolution in 6 months . Is this kid normal ? The revolution is gonna happen you know . Sure it will . We 'll fire a cannon off of Aurora and go seize the Winter Palace , too . Please calm down . He has a rich imagination . If he used it more wisely , he could become an artist or something . Well his only accomplishment so far is conditional expulsion . Please . Maznièka will be the first one to start jingling keys . What keys ? What jingling ? Let 's make a bet . On November 17th , there will be a revolution . Let 's make a bet . Why exactly November 17th ? He has all this nonsense thought through pretty well . - You have to give him that . - Look . I want this to be crystal clear . Think whatever you want , but keep your mouth shut in school . Do you understand ? I have your graded papers here . We 'll do this in alphabetical order , as always . A , A , C , B , D , C , C , C , B , F. An F for Kováø ? D , C. - Excuse me ? - Yes . Can I take a look ? Of course you can . Come up here . Does anyone else want to take a look ? Here it is . Perèa , I gave you a B. Wait a second . Here is a mistake I overlooked . And another one here . So , it 's not a B but an D. Anyone else ? No one ! OK . So let 's start our traditional mini-exam . Division of polymers - Mikulík ! We have natural and synthetic polymers ? That 's an D. Division of lipids ? Rybanská . Homolipids and heterolipids . An A , of course . Why do I even bother asking ? You could teach instead of me . Honzák ! Give it to me ! Acids and bases . What would happen if you splashed acid all over yourself ? I would be covered with acid ? How would you treat yourself ? Well ? You would use a base . Which one ? Horáèek . Excuse me ? Tell me which base do you know . You mean like an army base ? So , you will try to become a veterinarian ? I 'll try to get into the school . But I 'm not sure if I have a chance . Come on . Very few people have more knowledge about animals than you . But a very few people have such a bad profile from the Party 's point of view . Why do you think we 're moving ? My dad lost his job and found a new one as far as Hradec . It 's all gonna be fine . Before you graduate everything will change . - I forgot you are actually an oracle . - Eliška . You are gonna be a great veterinarian . Trust me . Do you have ID and other documents ? I do . - Petr ? - Petr ? Yeah . Don 't stay up late and don 't forget to turn off the lights . We 'll come back tomorrow . Around 3 . - Say hi to auntie for me . - Next time you could come with us . - She hasn 't seen you in a while . - Bye . - Maybe next time . - Bye . - See you . Wow . A fish ! You 're wet , aren 't you ? My folks have just left . We could come to my place and dry these clothes . - But that ... - No ! It will strictly be as a get together between friends . - You know I don 't give in that easily . - I know . I 'll be right back , OK ? What the hell are you doing ! No . I 'm not nervous . - Would you like some ? - No , thanks . Or , you know what ? Yeah . Perfect , huh ? Really good stuff . It 's from my grandma in Mokrá . I have an idea . So , another shot ? No , I won 't have any more . I fall asleep when I drink too much . I think I still have some pretzels in there . I would prefer nuts . Very well . Eliška . I got this idea that since my parents are gone we could ... And couldn 't we just lie here and listen to music ? That 's a good idea . Great ! I 'm better at watering plants . Good morning . Hi . I hope you are not mad about last night . That was the best sex I have never had . I 'll go make us breakfast , OK ? Or maybe not . But I have to warn you . I 'm not a one-night-stand type of girl . - It 's morning . - You know what I mean . OK . We 'll do this more then once then . Come inside the water . I don 't want to . - Why not ? - I hate the water . - Come on out . - Why ? I have brought you something . What is it ? Come out of the water and I 'll show you . Firstly . This is the number of Dr. Stárek . He 's my dad 's classmate and promised to get you ready for the admittance exams . Give you advice . Anything . Thank you . And secondly . Waldemar ? Waldemar , come here ... Come here ! Waldemar ! Waldemar ! No ! He ran away . You know what I 've been thinking about ? Tell me . What are we gonna do when I move away . I 'd like to introduce you to my parents . So you could visit me . That would be great . Or we could go to Krkonoše for a trip . Why go to Krkonoše ? I have my favorite place there . I would like to live there someday . Can I talk to you ? Of course . Have you slept with Kvìta ? - Me ? - Yes . You . We were in bed together but nothing happened . Nothing , huh ? - It 's a long time ago . - Long ago ? - Long ago . - It happened 14 days ago ! And for these past 14 days all you 've been saying is how much you love me . But I do love you , Eliška . Sure you do ! Eliška ! - Why do you keep following me ? - We cannot break up like this . - Kvìta is lying to you . - Kvìta isn 't lying to me . - Kvìta is lying to you . - She is not . Well , she certainly lied to you about this . Come see her with me . We 'll push her up against the wall . Stick a flashlight in her face and she 'll confess . Eliška . I don 't have enough time . But I do have time ! I will think this through . OK . I 'm giving you one minute . Or rather half a minute . You know what ? I have to go . Eliška ! Well , at least take this . And this . Bye . What about Zuzka ? Really good so far . At least that 's working out . What 's up with you ? You look kinda down , too . I 'm mad that I will probably have two Ds on my report card . That will not prevent you from becoming a CEO one day . Really funny ! Look . I shouldn 't be telling you this . But when you 'll be deciding one day what to start doing next , be sure to send your CV to Eurobank . OK ? Eurobank ? It doesn 't even exist . Well , not yet . You 're crazy . Wait . Can I talk to you for a second ? What did you gain from all this ? From what ? Do you feel good about yourself right now ? The last one is number 13 . The winning numbers for today are 5 , 12 , 13 , 16 , 26 , 30 a 42 . Goodbye and don 't forget to watch us next week . Unbelievable ! I 've won ! We have won 50000 ! Stop celebrating , dad . I didn 't place the bet . What ? On my way out I ran into Eliška and I forgot ... What ? We do not have 50000 because of some Eliška ? I 'll break you in half ! You no good idiot ! Wait until I catch you . You idiot ! - Hi . - What are you doing here ? I want to talk to you . - Is this her ? - Yeah , that 's her . Eliška . - Good afternoon . - Oh yeah . It 's a good one . Thank you very much , young lady . Because of you I 've just lost 50000 . Have you gone crazy ? Are you putting on a show for the neighbors ? - I hope nothing hit you , miss . - No , not at all . - Nothing hit me as well . - A beautiful blouse . - Thank you . - He missed me , too . Well , that 's actually a shame . You have one shoe outside . I had a talk with Kvìta . She confessed and told me what happened . I 'm sorry . What about Roman ? Is he still bothering you ? We have wrestling practice 3x a week . He thinks of me even more than you do . Now , that 's not true . You look really down today . It 's June 29th already . That is good news , isn 't it ? The summer break starts in 2 days . That 's the problem . You 're not looking forward to the summer ? Are you planning on going someplace ? Actually , yeah . Really soon . And I don 't want to go at all . If you don 't wanna go anywhere just don 't go . What 's wrong with you ? You look like you 've undergone torture . You wouldn 't get it . Our son has just told us we are complete idiots . You have been acting strangely the entire month , so the least you could do is tell us what is troubling you today . It 's just that ... I will miss it here . Are you going somewhere ? Well , actually no , but nothing will be the same again . He has really gone nuts . He was fine when he was born though . 4,2 kilos . No injuries in childhood . No , guys . You really wouldn 't get it . I just wanted to tell you that you are great parents . Really . Now you 're making some sense , boy . I don 't understand you at all but what you 've said now sounds very sensible . Pepa Perèa - two Ds . My boy , I really don 't know what will become of you . Lenka Prokešová - you have surprised me nicely . You have an A from history . Keep it up . Petr - I don 't understand you . Your grades in math , Russian , chemistry and physics have all gotten worse over the past month . Professor , I won 't need those in my life anyway . Sure you will , during your final exam . You dumbass ! Clowning around up until the very last minute . You 're experts in that . Thank you for all the presents . I don 't want to keep you here much longer . Have a wonderful summer break and start slapping each other once you are outside school . Goodbye . - Take care . - Bye . Eliška . Wait ! - I have to tell you something . - You can tell me at the party . I have to go home and pack . See you soon . I have returned for you from the future . This is how things are . I 'm actually a teacher and I 'm 40 years old . I 'm an adult and what you see right now is ... I am basically ... What you are looking at right now ... Eliška ! I don 't know if I have told you this yet but ... Kováø ! You idiot ! Eliška ? And so I went to that company which specializes in these things ... She won 't be able to understand ! One beer . Here you go , one for you . Thanks . Smile a little . Eliška . Dance with me . I 'll be with you in a bit . I shouldn 't have said that stuff . I 'm sorry . - Don 't worry about it . - So , you 're not mad at me ? It 's OK . Don 't be mad . Sorry . - Do you want to dance ? - I don 't dance . - Isn 't that a shame ? - It is what it is . - Hi , Dominik . - Hi there ! You 're Dominik ? Pouzar ? Yes , I am . Do you know me ? Petr ? What did you say the name of my future husband will be ? Wasn 't it Dominik Pouzar by any chance ? - Yes , that 's him . - Three kids , right ? - Three kids . - Thanks . Why didn 't you introduce yourself straight away ? - I want to dance too . - Pepa . Wait a sec . Eliška . Can I talk to you ? I 'll wait for you down there , OK ? So , what 's on your mind ? I would much rather not talk at all . But I have to . What 's up ? I 've thought about us a great deal and I realized ... I think that ... that we should break up . Why ? I don 't know . It seems like the right thing to do . Right thing ? Has something happened ? Or have I done something I shouldn 't have ? - No . Not at all . - Why then ? Just recently you 've told me that you love me . - I do love you and all that . - Well then I don 't get this at all . Is there someone else ? No . There is no one else ! Well then could you please explain this to me in a reasonable way ? I don 't know . I would like to . I would really like to explain this because there is a reason . There is a reason but I don 't know how to explain it . You just wouldn 't understand . OK ! Have it your way . You certainly know how to show up at a right time . - No problem . I 'll wait outside . - That would be nice of you . Eliška cried . Are you happy now ? Are you even aware of the fact I care about her ? - So do I. - Bullshit ! You would never treat her this way if you were in love with her . You won 't even think of her a month from now . You would be amazed . Where is she now ? She is crying her eyes out in there . Roman ! Roman ! Open the door ! Roman ! Eliška , can I walk you home ? No , don 't be mad . Please , Eliška . Stop thinking about that guy . He 's acting like a total jerk . Don 't you see it ? Roman , please . I want to be left alone . Hold on , please . In case you ever need anything , just give me a call . Good night . Say hi to your mom . Two beers . Thank you . Have a good night . What have you been doing there ? I would like to know that , too . You don 't mind the music isn 't playing anymore ? Not at all . - Eliška is gone , right ? - Yeah . Where have you been this whole time ? Roman was all over her . Is something wrong ? We broke up . What ? When ! Two hours ago . And now we have to get back together again . Before midnight ! Well , you certainly have work cut out for you . It 's 20 minutes to midnight . Phone . - Where is a phone ! - Outside , man . Seven beers . You 're improving . Eliška ? It 's me , Petr . Please , I just wanted to ... Eliška . Eliška ! - Why aren 't you running to meet Eliška ? - I won 't make it in time . Maybe she 's not sleeping yet . But I have to be home exactly at midnight . Otherwise I 'll get into huge trouble . My God . Your parents will survive if you come a little late , won 't they ? - Sure , but I might not . - Your parents are really that strict ? - Does anybody have a pen or paper ? - No . Sorry . - Wait here . - I 'm waiting for Zuzka . Can I borrow your pen ? Thanks . Eliška , I have to explain what happened . It 's complicated ... - Aleš ! - What is it ? Give this to Eliška tomorrow morning . OK ? Yeah . This is a matter of life and death . I 've made a terrible mistake . But why don 't you give it to her yourself ? I don 't have time to explain it to you . - Hey . - Hi . - So how was the party ? - Hard . Night ! Welcome back , Mr. Kováø . Please , go ahead . Petr , this is your mother . When are you gonna pick up that laundry ? Your dad over here is asking how 's it going with that new girl ? He bet me 500 that it 'll amount to something serious . Let me know . Soon ! I 'm in it for a 1000 . This is Novák from XYZ Publishing . Kováø , we have read your stories . From the Calf 's Head . We would like to publish them . Could you stop by to sign a contract ? - Is everything OK ? - Thank you . I have something for you . Thank you . - Good afternoon . - Hello . That consultation concerning the colours was a helpful one ? Of course it was . If it weren 't for you , I would have never finished that crime novel . When it comes to mixing colours , you are a true expert . That is ancient history . Nowadays , computers do all the mixing . However , I do have some perfect herbicides that would make a perfect murder weapon . - So if you ever need a consultation ... - OK . Thank you . Actually , I have recently thought of you . Remember how I used to buy gum from you when I was a kid ? Not only gum . We used to call you " Bashful " around here . Hi , Petr . I 'm happy to see you . Great ! How long are you back ? Why don 't you give me a call ? When are we going to see that movie together ? They 're not playing the Høebejk film anymore , but we can go see another one . OK . Excuse me now . I have to do something urgent . We 'll call each other , OK ? Sorry . Bye . Sure . So what ? Is it long ? Next . With what animal have you come here ? I 'm here to see the doctor in a personal matter . Do you want to ask me out on a date , or what ? Not a date , but rather a friendly meeting . Petr ? In person . Wow . What are you doing here ? I would like to plan a little class reunion for two people . Jana , could you please go out for a coffee ? I see that you have accomplished everything you had dreamed of . You think ? - What do you want to tell me ? - I don 't even know where to begin . You haven 't travelled such a distance to only ask me how I am , have you ? Well , I 've come for two reasons . The second is to find out how you are . Work-wise ... you can see for yourself . And what about Mr. Novotný ? I divorced him just like I divorced Mr. Ticháèek before that . - I don 't have any kids . - Why is that ? Because I wanted to be certain that the father will be a good and honest person . And those two were certainly not that . I understand . And your first reason ? I wanted to explain to you what happened . Did you get my message ? I did not get anything . Not even a letter . Aha . - I 'm sorry about that . - Well , that apology is long overdue . But even a train with a long delay eventually makes it to the end station . However , not all people are willing to wait for it there . But what if the delay wasn 't even the conductor 's fault ? Picking up the phone was not an option for him ? He did but you hung up on him . It is possible to change things . Even after a long time . Or is it not ? A couple of years ago I had a dog here . His paw got caught in a trap and this happened a long time ago . But that paw has never grown back and most probably never will . You messed up big time . What are we going to do about it ? - That 's what I would like to know , too . - Did you wish to pay ? You have to explain it to her . Otherwise , it will be hard for you to live with such a feeling of injustice . Should I go see her in Krkonoše again ? Not to Krkonoše ... I would like to ask you for one more return to the past . Just for one day . I already signed the form . Are you sure you want to go back ? I ruined something and I need to make things right . - Hi . - Hi . You have no idea how happy I am to see you now . Eliška ! What are you doing here ? Are you here to help me move , or what ? I just wanted to tell you that I 'm taking back the break up . It was a huge mistake . Who do you think you are ? You break up with me and then you just take it back ? - Are you crazy ? - It was a stupid thing to do . And I now know that you are the love of my life and that will never change . Hold this for me . That one was for the break up . You can give it back to me now . Could you hold it for me one more time ? That one was for making me cry . Slap me as many times as you want . But please forgive me . - I 'm gonna take this now . - Thank you . So what are we gonna do now ? That is mostly up to you . I have to explain something to you . Maybe , you will not believe it . Maybe , you will think I 'm nuts but everything is true . And it 's only going to be up to you what happens next . It will be freedom . Slovaks will no longer be with us . Our children will live in freedom . Damn ! Hrachovec ! Are you crazy ? Sorry , professor . Watch out for yourself or else you might not live to see the end of the summer break ! You stuntman . - Good afternoon , Mr. Štrba . - Hi . I keep bugging you with murders and you 're a poet ! You know . Women . They want a little romance while men want a little sex . Sex ? And isn 't Teta going to be mad ? She gets it . - Dáša ! Hi ! - Hi , Petr . How are you ? Have you been on your vacation yet ? Yeah . You are not mad at me ? No . Why ? Should I be ? - I guess not . - Well , I gotta run . - Otík is waiting for me . - Otík ? - Bye . - See you after the summer break . Hi . Hi . Hello . Eliška ? Petr ? I hope I don 't have to introduce you to your son . - Good morning , everyone . - Hi . Hello , daughter ? Mr. Kováø , that is so nice of you to call me your daughter . Please keep calling me that . It 's certainly much better than Ms. Jitka . Honey ! Breakfast . - Hi , guys . - Hi . Dad , I can 't get the window open again . Could you look at it please ? Is that all of us ? Are you expecting anyone else ? I 'm not sure . Just out of curiosity . Are you happy with your name ? I dunno . Pavel sounds OK to me . Pavel . That 's great ! - And what about you , honey ? - I don 't like it . And how would you like to be called ? My name is fine . It 's the name Pavel I don 't like . Shut up , sis . Linda isn 't anything special , you know . Do you want to rename us , or what ? No . I don 't want to change a thing . The names are nice . I would be surprised if you did . After all , you chose them in the first place . I just didn 't sleep well last night . But you are awake now , right ? I 'm not completely sure about that . Don 't worry . Everything will fall into place . I still feel like I 'm in a dream . I mean a nice dream . Or everything before this was a dream ? You 're not in a dream . I 'll prove it to you . If I 'm in some PC game then it 's a pretty cool one I have to admit . Do you want even more convincing proof ? - No , that 's OK . - I just still don 't get it , you know ? Remember ? You came to see me and left the future up to me . The following day I came to see you and we started dating . Oh . And that changed something ? Yes , it did . Today is our anniversary . You are incredible . Eliška , this is exactly what I 've wished for ! I love you - and that will never change . Did you catch the rabbit ? Rabbits ? You 're supposed to be doing frog jumps ! Come on . I 'll give you a good workout . One , two ! Maintain the rhythm . No flat frogs , gentlemen ! Keep jumping , keep up the tempo . That Šebrle was really hard on us ! We did not always have such hi-tech instruments . The history of calculation instruments dates back to prehistoric times . Archeologists found what during excavations ? Chewed-up bones ? Bones with cuts on them . Clear evidence the prehistoric hunter counted . Maybe he just wanted to create a ladder ? A ladder in the prehistoric age ? Unheard of ! If they had calculators back then . That 's enough . - Mr. Krejèíø ? - Yes . - You have to come with us . I desperately need to go to the toilet . May I ? Thank you . When and where was Vanèura born ? Bøezinová ? Vanèura was born in the 9th month . Very interesting . Do continue . And when he was born , he had a mother and father ... They all lived in a cottage where they had a bed , a window and a closet . That 's enough . Sit down . Hello , Mrs. Ptáèková . Yesterday , it was really noisy again at your place . That 's possible . I was breaking up with Marie again . But that would not have been so noisy . Unless she was beating you up with a guitar . Oh that . I have to play my guitar in order to calm myself down . Can 't you calm yourself down a little differently ? - More quietly , perhaps ? - All that is left is masturbation . There you go . Shouldn 't I slide down the railing in order to not make those stairs dirty ? Mr. Kováø . You are such a funny person . Such a sweetheart . Why do you insist on being such a pain in the ass with that guitar ? Manon is my destiny . Manon is all I have ever known . Manon is my first and last sin . Without Manon I wouldn 't know love . Where did I stop ? What 's wrong with you today ? My girlfriend dumped me . Try to picture her instead of me . Get that anger out of your system . You haven 't thought about her now . Actually , I had quite a vivid flashback of her right now . Damn ! Chandler , when will your new book be out ? I don 't know . I tried a different genre but all people want are crime novels . Then cut down on the number of dead bodies next time . Do you have any clue how many people piss me off ? You know you 'll be on my mind even 20 years from now . No , I won 't . - You will . - I won 't . - You will . - Petr , you 're so full of it . But it 's wonderful hearing you say it . - I 'm not full of it . - You are . - No , I 'm not . - Yes , you are . English subtitles : Igor Walter Subtitles by AZ Tools s. r.o.

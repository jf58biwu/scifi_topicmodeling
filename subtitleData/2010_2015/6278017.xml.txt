 ADWIN : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... We answer to a higher authority . ARTIE : These are the Regents . ADWIN : Regents discuss , and I make the final decision . STEVE : Agent Sally Stukowski . This is Artie ... Agent Nielsen . ( GROANS ) The door knob is gone . Somebody must 've followed us . ARTIE : Stukowski played us . STEVE : Why would she want an artifact ? She 's a sworn FBI agent . It 's done . MAN : Now we wait . ARTIE : Since the days of Warehouse 2 , the Regents have been its protectors . Its first field agents , they were responsible for instituting the artifact collection procedures that we carry out to this day . Over time , as more and more artifacts were amassed , the Regents became not only its governors , but also the keepers of its secrets . 528 Donald Street . For 2,000 years , their grace , their wisdom , and their sacrifice has ensured the Warehouse 's survival and security . Only now they are the ones that need protecting . FBI agent Sally Stukowski . Once we discovered that she 's the one who stole the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory doorknob , I began tracking her activities . Which , in addition to artifact heisting , also includes kidnapping . And if my calcs are right , murder . Four Regents have suffered artifact-related deaths in the past year ? People whose connection to us is supposed to be secret . How 's Stukowski cracking our code ? One of the many mysteries du jour . You got proof that it 's her ? Plane tickets , hotel bills , rental cars , all registered to aliases traceable to her . And now , a fifth Regent , Theodora Stanton , has been reported missing . Wait , I met her . You don 't think that she ... Looks like we need to have a little talk with Miss Sally Stukowski . Boys ! What are you doing here in Hotlanta on this glorious day ? Oh , you chasing more strangeness ? Where 's Theodora Stanton ? Who 's Theodora Stanton ? Drop it , Stukowski . We know you 've been stealing artifacts . And killing Regents . Killing what now ? Come on , boys , we 're all on the same side here . I don 't think so , lady . You 're coming with us . Whoa ! All right , Lattimer , no need to be rude . I am still a lady . ( SIGHS ) Say it . Fine . You were right . Zapping her should have been plan A. All right . Okay ! ARTIE : Giving credit where it 's due , you did cover your tracks well . Claudia , can you reassemble her phone ? Don 't have to . ( BLOWS ) SIM card . Well , well , well . What have we here ? Thanks for ruining my perfect retrieval record , Dolly Parton . Fire in the hole . And you 're not gonna be killing any more Regents with that , so you may as well start ... Y 'all are wasting your time . What 's done is done and done . What 's done ? What did you do ? Fine . Don 't talk . Oh , no . Y 'all are gonna beat it out of me with some paper . Unlike you , we don 't torture people to get information . Put her hand on the parchment . Sir Henry Morton Stanley 's map will tell us exactly where you 've been in the last 12 hours . There . That 's the place . She 's been to that location more than once . How do you know ? Because " X " marks the spot . MYKA : You sure this is it ? PETE : Sir Stanley 's map matched up with this address , 528 Donald Street . Whoa . Yeah . Even I 'm getting a bad vibe . No way . This building 's closed . NSA . You do know what those letters stand for , right ? National Security ... I don 't care if you 're the Pope . You 're not getting in here . You know what ? ( CHUCKLES ) I think we 're in the wrong building . Thanks , guys . I 'm really sorry . Thank you very much . PETE : Uh , Artie , we don 't usually get pushed around by rent-a-cops . Rent-a-cops don 't carry Colt.45s. You think they 're with Stukowski ? They would have shot us by now . No , something 's up . We got to get past them to figure out what . Claudia ? Oh , yeah . Tesla grenade . Don 't leave home without it . Artie . Yeah ? Look at this . That 's the Eye of Horus . That 's ... These guys are ... ( ARTIE STAMMERING ) What 's wrong ? Fortieth floor . Suite 4013 . Who 's Diana K. Snow ? Shh ! Claudia , Pete , check out that security camera footage . I want to know exactly what Stukowski was doing here . Myka , you 're with me . Wait , wait . What do we do when goons one and two wake up ? Improvise . You got me tied up pretty snug here , Stevie . I 'm not that kind of gal . Oh , not that you 'd care . You know , Sally , even if I did like girls , I 'm pretty sure an hour with you would turn me gay . Today 's going to end very badly for your people . Really ? Well , if it ends badly for us , it ends badly for you . Aw ! Agent Jinks , bless your heart , you can 't avoid the iceberg . The ship you 're on is going down . Lucky for you , there 's a lifeboat . You and I can both be on it . Now who 's wasting their time ? These Regents y 'all are running around trying to protect , they 're not the paragons of virtue you think they are . And I can prove it . MRS. FREDERIC : Can you , Miss Stukowski ? Because that is something I would very much like to hear . Okay , that closet ought to hold those guards for a while . Any sign of Stukowski on the security footage ? Yup . She 's got a playmate . All right . Artie , she wasn 't alone . Stukowski has a partner ? PETE : And they were both here earlier dressed as painters . Find him . See what he knows . CLAUDIA : And SIM card . ( SIGHS ) Let 's see who Stukowski has on her evil friends and family plan . Hold , please . Multiple calls to the same number within the past 48 hours . Triangulating that number 's current location brings us to ... 2128 Peachtree Avenue . PETE : That 's got to be where Stukowski 's partner is right now . I am so glad you 're on our team . Artie , who is Diana K. Snow ? Adwin Kosan . It 's an anagram . That 's all right , Mr. Jackson , they are Warehouse agents . Mr. Kosan , forgive the intrusion , but we have reason to believe your life may be in danger . That 's highly unlikely , Agent Nielsen , no one knows we 're here . We ? " We " who ? Three Regents in one place . ARTIE : Yeah , three birds with one stone . You all need to come with us right now . I imagine you two are the reason my men downstairs aren 't responding . Possibly . You are ... Going to be a problem . Mr. Jackson is the head of Regent Security . This is Philip Petrov from Moscow , and this is ... Jane . You were about to explain the reason for this intrusion . Sally Stukowski , this is the woman who has been picking off your fellow Regents , was in this building earlier today with an accomplice . Now we have her in custody . Thank you . Might have started with that . Sirs , ma 'am , this location 's been compromised . We need to go now . Oh , what a good idea . Last time someone targeted the Regents was 1812 . Napoleon tried to wrest control of Warehouse 11 from Czar Alexander I. Precautions had to be taken . Miller ? Stentz ? Do you copy ? Why didn 't you bring more men ? The Regents do not travel with an army . We are not the President , Agent Bering . We meet rarely , and when we do , we do so quietly . We never meet in the same place twice . This location was chosen only three hours ago . Then how did Stukowski find you ? She 's obviously more resourceful than you realized . Wait , no , the ... The stairs are safer . Elevator 's faster . 40 flights of stairs will take way too long . Yes , but ... With all due respect , Agent Bering , we had this building secure until your team showed up . ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) What is happening ? The automatic brakes engaged . That only happens in case of emergency . ( THUDDING ) What is that noise ? Give me a boost . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( PANTING ) That 's why you don 't take the elevator . What do you see up there ? The cables are gone . There 's a corrosive energy eating away at the emergency brakes . We don 't have much time . Artie , did you bring the grappler ? Of course . That 's not standard Warehouse issue . It was in 1890 . Okay . Tie it up . Open the doors . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) All right , hurry up ! Out ! Quick ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Oh ! Go now ! ARTIE : Are you all right ? ( GASPS ) ( ELEVATOR CRASHING ) ( PANTING ) Stukowski 's got another artifact . SALLY : Well , Irene Frederic herself . I am honored . Drop it , Sally . You 're from Connecticut . ( IN UNACCENTED VOICE ) Wow . Pretty good . That 's right , boy wonder , even the human lie detector can 't hear a phony accent . So , what , I 'm supposed to be scared ? Fear is a powerful motivator , Miss Stukowski , but we both know what really motivates people is pain . All those people you tortured and killed were more than just Regents . They were my friends . Those friends are the ones that started this , lady . Started what ? What did you do ? You 'll see soon enough . We 're terribly sorry to be losing such a valued customer , Mr. Aquino . Isn 't there anything I could do to change your mind ? No , no , no , just transfer the funds to this account at the Grand Cayman Federal . PETE : Okay , Stukowski 's partner . What 's the 411 on this guy ? According to Interpol , James Aquino is a demolitions expert and wanted in nine countries . He enjoys hand-to-hand combat , mixing Molotov cocktails , and instigating regime change in foreign lands . Well , Sally has some high-class friends . So if she 's going all Ten Little Indians on the Regents , shouldn 't one of us be minding the reservation ? Well , there 's no safer place on Earth than the Warehouse . Artie says its contingencies have contingencies . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) All right , I 'm going in . We 're hot on the bad guy 's trail now , Artie , what 's up ? Stukowski took out the elevators in this building using some kind of corrosive artifact . Now her associate may still have it . Be careful . MANAGER : Okay , Mr. Aquino , you 're all set to go . Thank you very much . Hold on there , Jimmy boy . Just have a few questions , like you realize that 's not a gun , right ? You have no idea what this can do . I 'm on fire ! He 's out the door ! Artie says he may have an artifact . I would have to agree . Okay , so there 's two sets of stairs . There 's one on the east corner and one on the west . We should split up . Okay , I 'll take the east corner . Wait . My men downstairs just broke out of that closet you locked them in . They 're gonna meet us on the east stairwell . No , no , no , there may be other traps . You tell them get out of the building and to call emergency services . Mr. Kosan . We 'll wait here while you and Agent Bering check things out . Agent Bering , I 'm going with you . No , ma 'am . It 's too risky . Wait , you mean like taking the elevator ? That kind of risky ? Well , if you hadn 't zapped my men , we might 've known that the elevators had been compromised . Or you still might all be up on the 40th floor waiting to die . Or we 'd have been alerted to the danger . I 'm going . End of discussion . This is a typical snag , bag , and tag . I 'd hate to see what it 's like when things are all FUBAR . Well , I 've been doing this long enough to always expect the unexpected . Oh , I stay well apprised of you and your partner 's exploits . The west stairway has been compromised up to the 11th floor . Same thing in the east . Stukowski 's cut off all the exits . Which leaves us with no way down . Well , when you cannot go down , it would appear there 's only one direction left , no ? Emergency services are on their way , but they won 't be much help this high up . There 's a helicopter on its way . ETA 30 minutes . Excellent . Thank God . I don 't like that look . I 've seen that look before . Yeah , there 's something not right . We got up here too easily . Way too easily . MYKA : Wait here . ARTIE : That 's a reflection of our building . That is coming fast . Yeah . We don 't have 30 minutes . What do you mean , " He got away " ? Aquino used some kind of wacky spray paint can to disintegrate the bank manager 's jacket . That explains the anarchy symbol . What anarchy symbol ? The one that is destroying the structure of this building . Look , look at this reflection . What are you wasting time talking to us for ? Yeah ! Get the hell out of there ! Listen , the elevators are gone , the stairs are a death trap . We are stuck on this roof until a helicopter arrives or the building disintegrates . I 'm pulling for the helicopter . All right , we 'll snag and bag the can . Maybe that 'll stop it . Let 's do that quickly , shall we ? Aquino could be anywhere by now . How are we supposed to find him ? Hey , Big Brother 's watching . Yes , yes . So can little sister . I understand , Mr. Kosan . I will do whatever it takes to get the information from her . Godspeed . Will the helicopter make it ? It would appear unlikely . More innocent people , Stukowski . Not so innocent , Jinksy . Now , you 're going to tell us about that spray can and what we can do to stop it . Oh , I never was much of an artist , but I always loved to paint . Don 't test me , Miss Stukowski . You used the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory doorknob to torture and then immolate Theodora Stanton . But you 're not the only one who has access to those kinds of artifacts . Ma 'am ? This is not the doorknob , but when it 's finished with you , you 're going to wish it was . That 's from Unit 731 . You 're very well-informed . What 's Unit 731 ? Special Japanese military unit during World War II that performed human experimentation and biological warfare research . It 's the medal from Shiro Ishii 's coat . The commander of Unit 731 . This can achieve in a few seconds what would take even the most experienced interrogator days . You 're bluffing . Artie said you don 't torture . I 'm not Artie . ( GASPING ) ( GROANING ) ( GASPING ) You see ? It can simulate drowning . You understand now , don 't you ? So you really think you can find him ? Aquino 's on the run . I highly doubt he 's gonna let a red light stop him . What I can do is tap in to Atlanta 's traffic cameras , which will flag moving violations . Yep , got him . Told you . Well , he 's got an offshore account in the Caymans . I 'll bet he 's headed for one of the airports . Well , he 's not on any commercial ... Wait . He booked a charter out of Cassaday . That 's private jets only . If he gets wheels up , we 're done . All right , he 's at this intersection . Here 's the airport . No , there 's no way we 'll catch him in time . Not necessarily . The Highlander nav system is off the hook , but Aquino 's car has a notoriously lousy one . Yeah , well , he doesn 't have satellite radio , a backup camera , and ten cup holders either , but that doesn 't help us stop him from getting on a plane . Claudia , what is that ? CLAUDIA : Just a little something I whipped up . Prepare to have your mind blown because you did not see this coming . CLAUDIA : ( MIMICS AUTOMATED VOICE ) Left turn ahead . Proceed west 0.23 miles . ( LAUGHS ) Next right and then traffic alert . Alternate route advised . Take the next left , then proceed east 1.5 miles . MRS. FREDERIC : Talk to me , Sally . You can make this stop . ( SALLY GASPING ) Mrs. Frederic , a word . MRS. FREDERIC : What is it , Agent Jinks ? We don 't torture people . Need I remind you of the lives Miss Stukowski has already taken ? And she will pay for her crimes , but in a court of law , not like this . This is not a democracy , Agent Jinks . Mrs. Frederic , no form of torture has ever yielded credible intel . It 's been statistically proven . Agent Jinks , I have people who are about to die and that woman has the information I need to free them . Now if this is the way I have to extract it , so be it . Now then , where were we ? Myka ? What ? There 's a window-washing rig down on the 15th floor . That could be our ticket out of here . Can we get to it ? Window-washing rig ? Yeah . Seriously ? You have a better idea ? How do you propose we get there ? Maybe the corrosion hasn 't reached the 15th floor yet . It 's a chance not worth taking . Oh , for God 's sake . Look , I know that you are the head of security for the Regents and their lives are in your hands . I get that . I do . But our window of opportunity here is closing every second . Now we can either take this one shot or watch it close . Which would you prefer ? Let 's move . Oh , brilliant . I 'd heard you could be rather persuasive , Agent Bering . My dad used to call it bossy . Curse of a natural-born leader . I wouldn 't say that I 'm a natural-born leader . That 's why you were reinstated . You know about that ? Of course you do . You 're meant to be here , Myka . We all are . I 'm not sure I believe in destiny . At a time when we may have felt the least prepared to accept the challenge , the Warehouse called upon each of us . You . Artie . Me . And we answered that call . If that isn 't destiny , what is ? Mr. Jackson , what 's the status of your men downstairs ? Miller ? Stentz ? Everybody , up ! MYKA : Everybody , upstairs ! JACKSON : Now ! Now ! Jane , give me your hand ! Jackson ! Give me your ... I got you . ( JACKSON CRYING OUT IN PAIN ) Whatever it takes , save Philip . Just hold on . Just save Philip ! What are you doing ? Saving you ! No ! ( SCREAMS ) ( PANTING ) ( METAL GROANING ) ARTIE : It 's eating through the structure . We 've got to get to that window-washing rig now ! Mr. Jackson understood the hazards of this job , Agent Bering . As do you . But we 're not out of Dodge yet , so cowboy up . MRS. FREDERIC : Time is running out . How do I stop the paint ? Go to hell . Mrs. Frederic , please , there 's got to be another way . Berlin Wall ! It 's from the Berlin Wall ! Tell me how to stop it . No , I don 't know ! Tell me how ! I don 't ... I don 't know anything . Please , I can 't ... Please , you 're killing me . Please , I can 't . I can 't ... STEVE : I 'm sorry , ma 'am ... ( COCKING GUN ) But I can 't let you do this . ( GASPING ) Stand down , Agent Jinks . STEVE : No . I may be new , but I know this is wrong . This is not what we do . Protecting the Warehouse is what we do . If you are not up to the task ... Actions have consequences , and this will come back to bite us . Now , Mr. Jinks , we must address the consequences of your actions . CLAUDIA : Well , it 's not in our database . I mean , I searched Berlin Wall and spray paint can and all I got were a bunch of photos of East Germany . Let me see them . Of course . What ? For nearly 30 years , the wall was a symbol of oppression . For young East Berliners , the anarchy sign was the ultimate expression of their rebellious spirit . Somehow that spirit gave an ordinary spray paint can the ability to tear down more than just walls . All right , so you think if we find the can , we can reverse it ? Artie and Myka are still trapped inside . This is bigger than the lives of our people , Agent Lattimer . Get that can and get back there ASAP . Well , you heard the lady . Reel him in . CLAUDIA AS AUTOMATED VOICE : Take the next left , proceed ahead 100 feet and then ... Prepare to be captured . Cover me , Claud ! On it . ( WEAPON CHARGING ) Hey , hey , hey , Jimbo ! It 's over , man ! Stand back . Just give me the spray can and tell me how it works . Forget it , pal , we 're both cooked ! No . Look , we can figure something out , okay ? Just tell me how it works and how we can stop it . No idea . Anyway , you kill me , or he does . Who ? Who are you working for ? We can protect you . You can 't even protect yourselves . Either way , I 'm dead . No , no , no ! No , no , no , no ! Claudia , get the bag ! You think that stopped it ? I don 't know . Call Artie and see if it worked . The window-washing rig should be just two floors below us . Yeah ! Any luck ? The can is snagged and bagged . Is it over ? No . The building 's still coming down . We 're running out of time . I don 't know . Maybe we need to be closer to it . Yeah . Okay , guys , just hold on ! We 're on our way . Pete ? Yeah ! Hurry . We 're already there . ( METAL GROANING ) Kosan ? ( GROANS LOUDLY ) You all right ? I 'm all right . Philip ! Where 's Philip ? ( SCREAMING ) Philip ! Philip ! Here , Artie ... Don 't touch that ! Philip , here , let ... There 's no time . Jane , we must make a transfer quickly . ( STAMMERING ) What are you doing ? What is that ? The Remati Shackle . Genghis Khan went to great and terrible lengths to create it , to make sure that the Mongols kept control of Warehouse 7 . It can 't be destroyed by conventional means . No Warehouse agent has seen what you 're about to witness . ( SCREAMING ) The transfer 's complete . Mr. Kosan , we have to get out of here now . Let 's go . Now . Jane ! We can 't just leave Philip here ! Jane , you must . Or all this will be for nothing . My time is over . You are the Guardian now . The window-washing rig is ... It 's still there . Oh , thank God . Jane . Jane , we have to go , okay ? All right . I hope you have a ladder in there . Lloyd Wright 's pick-up sticks . Yeah , Frank 's son used to play with these while watching his father work . He would often copy his designs . These got me out of a bad scrape in Bangkok in ' 94 . Except that was a few pounds ago . I think I better get down there and see if this thing holds . Good luck . Oh , God . Oh , God . All right . Look , he knew the risks , okay ? And so do you . So , cowboy up , lady . Because we 're getting the hell out of Dodge . Come on . Now you , Jane . Adwin , get down that ladder before you pass out . Jane , I 'm fine . You really must ... Go . Hurry ! Be careful . Come down ! I 've got to ... We 've got to get this rig up , up there . It 's no use . Without power , this lift will only go down . Myka ! I 'm coming up for you . No , Artie , listen , there 's not enough time ! Artie , the ladder 's already corrupted . I 'm not leaving you ! Go , Artie ! We 'll ... We 'll find another way down . What 's going on up there ? What the hell is that ? Toxic chemical spill . There are people trapped on 17 . Chemicals ? Joe , get downtown on the phone . We 're not equipped to handle a situation this big . There 's nothing you can do . I 've got a team coming , just get out of here ! Let 's go . Everybody , back . What if Jane doesn 't make it ? That 's a possibility we cannot entertain . She 's the Guardian now . She must be rescued . She has to be rescued . No , no , no , no . Get him to a medic . She has to be . Get him to a medic . You have to get out of here ! There must be something we can use to lower ourselves down . What would they do if there was a fire ? A fire . Myka , get those elevator doors open . MYKA : This shaft is clear . Tell me that you 're not suggesting that we jump . There 's two of these on every floor . We can go four floors at a time , all the way down to the basement exit . I 'm impressed . A little trick my husband taught me . What , was he in Die Hard ? Hope you 're not afraid of heights . How did you know ? Okay , I 'm coming ! Artie , you made it ! Artie , where 's Myka ? She and the Regent are still up there . You left her in there ? How could you just leave ? No , no , Pete , no . There 's nothing we can do . Look . The anarchy symbol . Where 's the spray can ? It 's right here . What , you think we can reverse it ? An artifact that is born of extreme emotion sometimes require extreme emotion to be triggered , to be neutralized , so I thought if we ... Graffiti . Those German taggers were constantly spraying over each other 's messages . Okay , so we spray over Stukowski 's symbol . You think that 'll work ? It 's worth a try . That anarchy symbol represents chaos and destruction . So we paint the opposite . Well , I 'm at extreme emotion right now . Oh ! Oh ! Yes ! Thank God I didn 't wear my good shoes . Just help me open this door . Yeah . Okay . If we can get through the basement , there are often underground tunnels that ... Oh , no . Not exactly the Butch and Sundance moment I was hoping for . More like Thelma and Louise . ( EXCLAIMS IN DISMAY ) Come on , come on ! Keep going , Pete , it 's working . Nice ! Yes . Okay . Come on , let 's go get Myka . Come on ! ( GASPS ) ( BOTH LAUGHING IN RELIEF ) For some reason , I think that Pete had something to do with this . He 's a good partner . Yes ! ( LAUGHS ) MAN : Sally , Sally , Sally . ( CHUCKLING ) What was unclear about , " Destroy that building and everyone in it " ? I 'm sorry . They had more resources than we thought . And Mrs. Frederic has no trouble crossing the line . Never underestimate the denizens of Warehouse 13 , Sally . You know they are dangerous people . There is a silver lining , though . You were right about Agent Jinks . He hasn 't drunk the Kool-Aid yet , and I 've already started working on him . That won 't be necessary . I 'm sorry . MAN : Hmm . I 'm sorry , too , Sally . It 'll look like an undetected heart defect . Marcus , you were right . She wasn 't up to it . I 'll make sure someone finds her . You 're a good friend . PETE : ( STAMMERING ) Where 's Myka ? Myka ! Myka ! Hey , Pete . I 'm ... Hey . I 'm okay . I 'm fine . Hey , I 'm fine . Claudia traced a routing number back to the people we believe hired James Aquino . It 's a company called A to Z Technologies . Whoever they are , they know far more about us than we know about them . An enemy with an arsenal of artifact weapons would not only be dangerous . No , they could be unstoppable . Until we can identify these people behind this A to Z Technologies , we must fortify our defenses . And once we identify them ? Strike , and strike hard . Come on , this was no assassination attempt . The Remati Shackle , that was the real target . I 'm afraid so . They were trying to destroy it . Why ? What 's its power ? Protection . In an emergency , that shackle is the last line of defense for Warehouse 13 . Well , that was crappy day at the office , huh ? What 's going on ? You look like you put down Old Yeller yourself or something . You know , Claud , there is no one that I would rather chase artifacts with than you . Why am I sensing an ugly subtext here ? I was insubordinate today . ( SCOFFS ) Please . Welcome to my world . No , I 'm serious . It 's complicated . I drew my gun on Mrs. Frederic and she fired me . What ? No . No . No , no , no . That 's ridiculous . I 'm gonna go talk to her . I 'll just explain to her it was just a misunderstanding . No , don 't . Please . Don 't . I 'm sorry , Claud , but I can 't do what she wants . I 'm sorry . You know , you 're really not allowed to face death without me . ( CHUCKLING ) Next time , I promise . And I heard you had to babysit one of the Regents . That must have been a pain . Actually , she 's kind of kick-ass . Come on , I want to introduce you . Yeah ? Yeah . Uh , Jane ? Jane ? Hey , I want you to meet my partner . This is Agent Pete Lattimer . Mom .

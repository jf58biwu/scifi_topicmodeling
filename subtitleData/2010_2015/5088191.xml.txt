 The ends of the earth was a place so deadly that shield from outside world . Welcome ... To the bug jar ... Where monstrous creatures roam free ... Where a faceless ruler seeks escape to inflict his wrath upon humanity . But now the great barrier is on the verge of failure ... And the hope of all mankind lies in the bravest , most capable of hands . And , uh , speaking of hands , you 've got four . Think you could lend one ? Whoops . Guys , what 's the shield status ? Power regulator 's completely trashed , doc . I 'll need to control it manually until I can get it started . Mm . Kind of ripe in here . That little back door there not the bathroom . More bug jar buddies . I got the last one . Fine . Hold this . And whatever you do , do not let go . Or what ? Kaboom ! He will pay . Okay , little wormie , come to papa . Whoa . Yet even in this forsaken place , our hero runs afoul of his evil Nemesis ... Van Kleiss . ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way ♪ ♪ we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ Activating stealth suit . Looks like Van Kleiss decided to crash the party . Just like that guy not to phone ahead . And he brought his pack flunkies . Biowulf , Skalamander , Breach . Circe ? Get ready . They 're headed straight for ... someplace else . Gonna find out where . No way . You 're not leaving me here with your ... Sorry . Another call . Rex , why aren 't you fixing that shield regulator ? Hint ... you may remember him from such schemes as " destroying Providence headquarters " and " trying to take over the entire earth . " Van Kleiss ? In there ? You 're right . You should investigate , after you fix the shield . Then it might be too late . - She 's there , isn 't she ? - Who , Breach ? Yeah , but ... A quick recon , and that 's it . I 'll try to buy some time at this end . And I want regular check-ins . Yep . Got it . Intriguing . An entire divergent branch of evo development . This place is a waste of our time . Van Kleiss knows what he 's doing . It 's not your place to question . Question ? You dare accuse me of disloyalty ? Hmm . Sorry . Get a grip . With no care for his own safety , our brave hero tails his quarry into the very lion 's den . Unknown to the villain , he 'll be meddling in forces he can 't possibly control . Circe , if you would ? Intruders ! Who are you ? Someone in a position to help you . Follow . Breach , with me . The rest of you , remain here . Master , my place is at your side . I want no interruptions , Biowulf . Is that clear ? Okay , folks , here 's the 411 . V.K. , Noface ... getting cozy . Gonna try to bust it up . That 's all I got for now . Over and out . Oh , don 't you dare hang up . I 'm feeling a cramp coming on . You 're right , you know . We should be down there with him . What is he up to , anyway ? I ... do not know . You don 't know ? I thought he trusted you with everything . Of course he does ! He just ... Hey ! Easy on the stealth suit ... Which apparently isn 't so stealthy . Rex ? Providence spy ! Right ! Man , got it in one ! Yep , we heard V.K. was looking for a new second-in-command . What ? ! True story . Got it straight from intel . Not surprised , really . That Noface is one bad dude . Guess Bio-whelp here ain 't cutting it these days . Seen it before . First they keep you out of meetings . Then the boss chews you out for trying to do your job . Next thing you know , you 're king orders from the new guy , and you 're just another hench like Skalamander . Now comes the moment where our hero sweeps the girl off her feet . Don 't let him ! Literally ! - Hey ! Let ... - See you around , henchie ! Follow them ! Down ! Now ! Not till we hear each other out . Sure . I 'll go first . Aah ! Oh , great ! Way to go , Circe ! Any word from Rex ? He ain 't back , and I 'm still holding the bag . Hold on . Rex ? That you , pal ? Hidin ' in plain sight . I hate this place . Invaders have come before . They brought only pain . It is a pain we both share . The same Providence outsiders attacked my lands , destroyed my army . There was one who tormented us ... Humiliated us . The grower of machines . Ah , Rex . Another thorn we share . My proposal is simple . You control a formidable legion . I , in turn , can provide the escape and the vengeance you seek . I can be your liberator . You can be my general . Together , we will crush our enemies , starting with the one you hate most . Now , then , are we ... Master , I have a report . This is a private conversation . Can 't you handle the slightest detail without bothering me ? Of course , master . It was nothing . Whoa ! Aah ! Ouch . Our hero pursues the girl of his dreams , heedless of her attempts to break his heart . Along with the rest of him . Circe ! Just give me one minute , okay ? Look , no powers . One minute . But if this is about leaving the pack ... Please . I 'm way past that . There are bigger things going on here than who you hang out with . 50 seconds . I wasn 't sent here to spy on you . I 'm here to stop these things from ever getting out . 40 . Why are you telling me this ? You know who I am . You 've seen the things that live here . Whatever deal you think Van Kleiss is making , it 's going to turn out bad for everyone . 30 seconds . I do know who you are , Circe . Just once think for yourself ! Maybe your perfect leader could actually be wrong , maybe even a bit crazy . Nuts ! Certifiably insane ! Shut up ! 20 . Talk about blinded . Did you ever wonder why van kleiss is so interested in you ? Oh , I don 't know . Maybe he wants me dead . Not anymore . Something has changed , Rex . Ever since you got your powers back , I hear him talking . Says you have something that 's the key to everything . For whatever reason , he needs you alive . I know it , Rex . He 'd never let you be killed . - Never , huh ? - Time 's up . Enough talk . Free us . You understand I need certain ... assurances . Assurances ? Explain . If I free you , will you trust in my leadership and mine alone ? Leadership must be proven . Show us you can defeat our enemies . Now , this looks like a party . Rex . You never cease to amaze me . Defiler ! Give it to us ! Now do you believe I can deliver what I say ? Will you agree to my leadership ? We agree to it ! Give it to us ! Now ! Now ! Now ! Van Kleiss , I didn 't bring Rex here so you could ... He 'll kill him ! Never forget how I found you , Circe , what you were before . He 's yours . You ! Bring him to the vestibule ! You have your orders . I 'm going to enjoy this . You were supposed to finish me off . Now you just get to watch with the other hench bags . Surrounded by the jeering throng , the hero faces certain doom . The heartbreaker looks on . When it 's over , she 'll regret shunning his advances . Now you feel ... My pain ! First , a few ground rules . Nothing below the belt , and I have a date on Friday , so easy on the face . It 's not exactly a problem in your case , having no face and all . Huh ? Aah ! No anchovies on pizza . No stripes with plaids . Aah ! Termine ser sentados , por favor ! Is this what you wanted ? Stop this ! Please ! You need him alive ! Alive ... yes . Heart pumping , lungs breathing . But his mind ? The less that 's left of that , the better . Circe , I warn you . Lift so much as a finger to help him , and you 're finished . I 'll have this trash removed . And now that you 've had your fun , it 's time to finalize our ... We will have our full revenge ! It seems we 've reached something of an impasse . We take orders from no one ! I 'm not driving a wedge between you , am I ? Well played . Good news for me . For you , not so much . Pity we couldn 't have worked something out . Breach , if you would ? Looks like the hard way , then . Huh ? His work here finished , the hero does the noble thing . He runs like a thief . Adiós ! Where the heck have you been ? ! You 're not still holding on to that , are you ? Because it 's a good thing ... you know , with the whole kaboom . - Doc , I 'm back . - There you are . Rex , listen to me . If the shield fails , the only solution is a cold reboot of the system . I don 't need to tell you what will happen if the things in there get out . Keep your lab coat on . This will only take a minute . Or maybe not . Doc , you remember back at the briefing , all that stuff you were saying about worst-case scenarios ? Yeah , we have a winner . I got nothing . Great . 'Cause this situation 's not random enough already . Let 's throw some raging teen hormones into the mix . You , Biowulf , even me ... We 're all just means to an end for him . He doesn 't really care about any of us . Oh , you finally figured that out . Well , better late than never , I guess . It 's not too late , not if I have anything to say about it . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! There are some of us around here that might not like the sound of whatever you 're about to do . I 'll adjust the frequency to exclude friendly evos . - Does that include me ? - For now . Whoa , mama ! I thought you said you could filter it . It 's not an exact science . It worked . You 're calling them all back . And right towards us . Torn between saving his friends or the world , our hero makes the stupid choice . Come on , Bobo ... Focus . Think bananas . Think how much you hate ' em ! Get that thing running . Rex , you 'll need to follow this sequence exactly . No time for that ! Shield activation in 60 seconds . 59 ... 58 ... Gotcha . Not seeing much of a difference . We are out of here ! - You coming or what ? - I was never here . 14 ... 13 ... 12 ... 11 ... 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 . Van Kleiss ? Eh , Breach 'll get him out ... Eventually . But right now he 's in there , you 're out here . You 'll never have a better time to consider , you know , your options . What is it about stealing from our own people that 's so dang satisfying ' ? You forgot to remove the tracker . Eh . Funny that . I 'm not going to Providence . Doesn 't matter where you go . All that matters is that you want to go there . That said ... I hear Hong Kong 's nice this time of year . And so the tired warrior journeys homeward ... crisis averted , world saved , villains vanquished . Girl not got . Again ! Do you have to rub it in ?

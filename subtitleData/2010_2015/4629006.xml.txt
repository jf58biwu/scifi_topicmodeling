 You boys look tired . How ' bout a nap ? Anybody else wanna go ? Texas ! Save us ! We can 't punch good ! Oh , you 're so unbelievably awesome . I just wish I noticed sooner . Oooh-wa-ka-ka-ka ! Abraham Kane . Well , if it isn 't Texas . The greatest martial artist in all of motorcity . Behold . I have a gun that shoots a snake . Okay , and you 're just in time to feel my Texas twister ! No ! Not that ! How 'd you like to meet my friend ? His name is ... Ooooh-yah ! Curse your awesomeness , Texas ! And he says , " curse your awesomeness , Texas ! " And I kick him out the window . It 's easy ! Solid plan . Uh , let 's just put that in the back pocket for now . Come on , Mike . You always say that . Your pockets must be getting pretty full with all my plans in ' em . Sometimes you gotta Texas-ify ! Just look at this Texas twister kick . My tomatoes ! What the heck are you doing ? It took me six months to grow those ! And it only took Texas six seconds to destroy them . Yeah , Texas ! So what 's wrong with my plan ? I told you . This isn 't the time to storm the gates with sweet Muay Thai kicks . We 're on a stakeout . A stakeout ! Awesome ! I 'll have mine rare ! Then I 'll have plenty of strength to storm the gates with sweet Muay Thai kicks ! You 're not listening to a word he 's saying , are you ? We 're waiting for a waste-disposal bot to show up . A whatta-what-what-what ? Toxo tanks ? We 've been tracking them ? They come down to motorcity to dump Kane 's toxic waste . Not today they won 't . We 're gonna show Kane he can 't just dump his trash on us anymore . How close is it ? Five blocks coming up seven mile road . Hooo-ha ! Who are those guys ? They seem insane . No , they seem awesome . Uh , you guys seeing what I 'm seeing ? What is this place ? My sergeant says you tried to take out the Toxo tank . You must hate that pony-tailed maniac as much as we do . My name 's Kaia . I 'm the boss in these parts . Mike Chilton . Kane hater and leader of the burners . Any enemy of Kane is a friend of mine . Kaia , Texas . Other leader of the burners . I got just two questions : What 's with those masks and how soon could I get one ? It 's a long story , kids . Our community has always lived off the earth . Folks started calling us the Terra Dwellers . But one day our little Paradise got trampled by Kane 's monsters . The toxic waste kept coming . It mutated everything . Kane 's chemicals the very DNA of everything living down here . Breathe easy , son . It would take years to turn you into a mutant , dear . Whew . That 's awful , Kaia . Well , there 's one benefit . We use these crazy mutant plants to fight back . These bows are filled with super spores that grow down here . As soon as this stuff breaks open ... The spores grow into plants and the plants take over . Nice . I don 't get it , Kaia . Why haven 't you used your super-bad mutant weapons all over Kane 's ugly face ? Actually , that 's sort of what we 've been planning . What 're you doing with these old Toxo tanks ? I thought you were supposed to be the smart one . We 're gonna fill these things up with super spores . Can take out Kane 's waste facility then he can 't dope his chemicals on anybody ever again . Okay dokey , Kaia . I like your ideas , but I do have some thoughts . Hang on , Tex . Let 's just ... I mean , you can 't just tie these tankers up with rope , you gotta weld it . Dutch can do that . And Julie 's good with infiltrating . Mike can take credit for everything , and Chuck , oh , I don 't know what Chuck does , but he can , like , scream or something . And we can pull these Toxo things up to deluxe with our cars so you don 't need that freaky deer thing . Uh , Texas ... and most importantly , you gotta make this plan bigger ! You gotta Texas-ify it ! Texas-ify it ? Texas-ify it . Three Toxo tanks ? Times it by a thousand and better weapons ! Texas ... Texas twister ! Texas ! Take it easy , man . Back pocket , remember ? I think your friend 's got the right idea , Mike . This is just the opportunity we were looking for . We 'll team up to shut down Kane 's waste processing plant , and get to Texas-ify-ing ! Let the Texas-ifi-cation begin ! Sure is handy having someone who knows Kane 's machines . You tear up as many as we have , you get to know ' em pretty well . How well do you know the train up there ? It 'd be nice if we can get up to the waste processing facility without being shredded by his bots . There 's a blind spot near the Hamtrannik tunnel . Kane 's bots don 't patrol it that often . You 'll have about a ten-minute window . Yes , that will give us plenty of time . There . This rig oughta be enough . Even for a whole fleet of Toxo tanks . So how are we getting the others ? Hail , Texas ! Slayer of Toxo tanks ! You guys go ahead . I 'm gonna talk to Kaia about the plans . Kaia ? Kaia . You home ? Careful with that . This is way more dangerous than the old stuff . Kaia 's made some changes to the plan . So , how much more are we gonna need ? A lot more . And fast . Hello ? - Uh ... just a second . - You need something ? Uh , just looking for Kaia . Is she around ? She 's out somewhere . Tell her I stopped by . 'Sup , bro . Hey , you don 't look so good . Something 's up in this town , chuckles . What happened ? I 'm not exactly sure . Doesn 't feel right , though . Feels pretty right to me . Doo ! Bloo-bloo ! Oooh , wa-ka-ka ! Yeah , that 's good , huh ? Boo-Boo ! Just put your eyes on and see if you pick up on anything weird . You mean , like , the creepy gas masks or the giant , mutant plants f = growing everywhere ? Mmm , weirder than that . These people are hiding something . Hey , guys ? I think I found something . Good evening , Mike . Uh , Kaia . Hey ! Just , you know ... heading to bed . That 's too bad . We could really use your help with something . Oh , in the middle of the night ? All right , then . So what are we looking for again ? Anything out of the ordinary . Say , some guys washing out a chemical drum in the middle of the night . Is it just me , or do those guys not want us to know something ? And Chuck 's gonna go find out what that something is . I am ? Ugh . I am . So , where we going again ? To find a special moss that grows up here . It 's an essential part of our weapons . No-cholorum . Hey ! Come on . Gimmie a break . First time mushroom climber here . Oooh , yeah ! Well , don 't everybody grab me at once . Look at this sample , Jacob . You ever seen anything like that ? Looks pretty alien to me , kids . It 's different than the other vines . It 's ... I don 't know . Weird . You know , you guys need to stop bad-mouthing our hosts . Maybe they think you 're weird . Everybody pack up . We 're getting out of here . Whoa , whoa-di-whoa-dio , bro . What are you talking about ? I can 't say for certain , but I 'm pretty sure those terrorists just tried to take me out . - What ? - What ? Yeah , what ? Seriously , I didn 't hear you . You cut out . We were running through the mushrooms , and I know it sounds weird , but I wasn 't supposed to make it back . They 're up to something . And if they think we 're gonna help them , then they thought wrong . Now hold it . Don 't you think you 're overreacting here ? They led me onto a weak branch and none of them grabbed my hand . It sounds to me like you fell . You weren 't there , Tex . Now pack up . No . Can . Do . These people need us . And unlike some other people , they appreciate my skills . This has nothing to do with your skills . Yeah . Yeah , it does . You 're always hating on my ideas , man . I 'm in a place where I can finally shine , and it 's eating you up inside . Well , I 'm not gonna let you ruin my moment , Mike . If you won 't do this , I 'll do it myself . Wow . You want me to go get him ? Holy cow ! Look at this ! This leg is trying to shake my hand ! Hey there , little guy . Get it off ! Get it off ! Incinerator ! Now ! What is that stuff ? The sample tried to eat me ! Oh , man ! If that stuff gets released in deluxe , everyone up there will be wiped out ! Is everyone okay ? I thought I heard a lady screaming . Oh . Well , hello , Mike . I ... I 'm glad to see you 're okay . I 'll bet you are . Our little partnership is over , Kaia . Oh ? Why is that ? We 've seen what your new spores can do . We know what you 're planning . Yeah ! And I don 't scream like a lady ! That was a shame . I thought you 'd be on my side . After all , we 're fighting the same enemy . Yeah , but we 're not fighting the same fight . I hate Kane as much as anybody , but I 've got no beef with the people of deluxe . We can 't let you hurt them . I 'm sorry to hear that , Mike . But I 've worked too long and too hard for you to stop me now . Goodbye . Death by plants ? Not the way I wanna go . Come on , come on , come on ! Step aside , kids . This is a gardener 's job . Jacob ! If you 're going to fight giant , mutant plants , you might need some home grown herbicide . Oh , let ' em stay inside with their feet propped up . Who needs ' em anyway ? I can do all this my dang self . Roll out , boys ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Dogies ! Jacob , how much of that stuff do you have ? How much do you need ? How much do you have ? How much do you need ? How much do you have ? Gah ! Just tell me how much you need ! Okay , here we are . The waste processing place should be right up top . Just think , in a few minutes we 'll have brought down a tyrant . And we have you to thank , Texas . We could never have done all this by ourselves . I know . You do . I 'm just sorry my friends bailed on you . Don 't be . Not everyone has the stomach for this . Kaia 's gonna be heading for the hamtrammik tunnel . That 's a lot of ground to cover . What 's that stuff ? Salt . Plants hate it . As long as we stay in this circle , we 're safe . I thought we were just taking out that waste-processing thingamabob . Oh , trust me . It 'll get taken out too . Help us ! Hang on ! Those are innocent people in there . This ain 't what I signed up for , Kaia . Of course it is . You 're the one who came up with it . You 've got to Texas-ify everything . Without you , it would 've taken us years to put together a strike like this . But this ain 't Texas-ify-ing . This is evil ! And Texas don 't have no truck with evil ! Yeah , ha ! In your face , plants ! I wouldn 't say that just yet . Uh-oh . No ! We 're out of weed killer ! So long , burners . Eat gun-Chuck , plants ! Texas ! Leave my friends alone ! Texas , you made it ! And you got nasty plant gunk all over you . Good to see you too , ladies . Get the civilians to safety . Texas , you 're with me , buddy . You betrayed us . Now we 'll bury you up here with the rest of these swine . Take a good look , Mike . This is what Kane did to us . Why shouldn 't we do the same to his city ? These people didn 't have anything to do with that . Doesn 't that matter to you ? This might be a bad time to say this , but you were right , Mike . I was wrong about one thing , Tex . Sometimes , you do have to Texas-ify it . No , I 'm done Texas-ify-ing . My dumb idea is what got us into this . Hey , I do not put dumb ideas in my back pocket . I 've got one back there that would come in pretty handy right now . You 're thinking of the Texas twister ? Let her rip , buddy . - Help us ! - Help us ! Trying , sir . Just having some difficulties ! We need more herbicide . Or something to keep these vines away . Hey , I know what does that . He 's attempting the Texas twister like it 's never been done before , folks . In a car , in the red , with a tanker full of salt ! There ! Toward that ! He 's Texas-ify-ing the Texas-ifica-tion ! Thank you so much . Texas , you did it ! I know . I 'm awesome . Where 's that crazy forrest lady ? She is gonna hear it from me . The terrorists . They 're gone ! Man ! We didn 't even get payback ! People like Kaia don 't just disappear . We 'll catch up to her someday . Why wait ? Let 's go after them now ! Hold on ! Texas has an idea . Here we go . Okay , first , we get Dutch to build me a robot dinosaur from scratch . What ? Uh , Texas ... and then I eat all the terrorists with my new move , the Texas-asaurus Rex . With super-sized gun Chucks . Texas ... oh , and the dinosaur has to spit fire . Dutch can do that . Oh , boy . Burners ! Chirp .

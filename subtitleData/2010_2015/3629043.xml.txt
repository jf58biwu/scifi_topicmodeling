 Got your power . Isn 't that interesting ? I know why you can 't kill . Hiro Nakamura said you 're going to die alone , and it 's haunting you . We all need people who understand us . - Care for us . - Who 's she ? The love of my life . - He just shows up . - And he 's stalking you ? - He does seem ... - Obsessed ? I had to act , to protect you , to get you away from him . By kidnapping me ? You can never cheat the past . It 's bad , always ! Everything is connected . If you wanna change one thing , that 's all you do . I 've come back in time to save Charlie . And this time , I will defeat the brain man . There 's something I want you to see . It 's so magical , so beautiful . Just let me show you , that 's all . If you 're still unhappy , I 'll take you right back to California . Did they really think that they were gonna get away with it ? Forever ? That we would just never find out ? We shouldn 't have done it . I need time to grieve without being reminded why . Do you wanna talk about it ? About what ? Life among the carnies , the death of your father ... i mean , either one of those would be enough to mess me up . I don 't think I 'd know where to start . I just ... think it 's one of those things I have to figure out by myself . Listen . I 'm not gonna pretend to know what you 're going through right now . But I want you to know that I 'm here for you . If you need anything . Anything at all . I have this review lesson thing . I moved it to bapst hall , I have no idea where that is . East quad . Clear across campus . Of course it is . Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? How 's it coming ? It 's ready . Now remember , it 'll only work in the hands of one of us . Luckily , you have Hiro and Ando now . You sure I can 't change your mind ? I broke a promise to a girl . I need to make amends . Well , then I guess this is it . In our lives , when is it ever ? Thanks , Mohinder . Good luck . You too , Noah . Well , gentlemen , I guess it 's up to us . Hiro ! Hello , Carp . Adam Monroe ? But you are dead . Am I dead ? That 's for the judge to decide . - Judge ? - All rise . The Honorable Judge Kaito Nakamura presiding . Be seated . The world versus Hiro Nakamura , Your Honor . The what versus what ? Excuse me , is this Professor Yanno 's review session ? Nope . Study group . Ready to brainstorm ? What the hell are you doing here ? I came to learn . How 'd you sleep ? The dress is a gift . If you want to change into something ... a gift ? You kidnapped me , brought me to ... I don 't even know where we are because you won 't tell me . You 're right , I 'm sorry . I never meant to upset you . I 'll take you back home . Straight away . What ? What are you smiling about ? Your face . Just now ... It brought me back to when I broke your record player . Samuel ... You had this one song you played over , and over , and over . And I was just ... I was just kidding around but I broke the arm . Remember ? Yes . I remember . Good . 'Cause there 's something I still want you to see . The only thing I 'm interested in seeing is my own front door . But first , let me get you something to eat . And then you 'll be rid of me for good , I promise . This is how it always starts . Breakfast becomes lunch , lunch becomes dinner , dinner turns into drinks , and then ... I fixed your record player . I broke it and then I fixed it . I know what I 've done wrong , and I know how to make it good . With scotch tape , and wire hangers , and loads of good intentions . Fine . Something to eat . Then you take me home . Good . Great . He has a brain tumor . In the parietal lobe . The doctors in Japan said it 's inoperable , but ... we may not have a choice . Please , doctor , he 's my best friend . - I can 't just ... - Wait here . We 'll find out what 's happening . Please help him . It is our intent to prove that the defendant abused his power to bend space and time selfishly and repeatedly for his own personal gain . And with a blatant disregard for the consequences on the space-time continuum . This is some bad dream or tumor hallucination . Let the record show that the defendant fails to recognize the authority of this court . This isn 't a court , it 's a diner . Perhaps your honor could enter a plea for the defendant if he refuses ? Mr. Monroe , please call your first witness . The prosecution calls kimiko Nakamura . And Ando Masahashi . You know how much I would love to kill you ? Listen ... I know you must hate me . You killed my father ! Nathan ... It seems like a lifetime ago . But I 'm a little off my game . You 're gonna help me get it back . Says who ? Says this . Your face showing up in ink wasn 't my choice . It 's destiny showing me my desire . And you actually thought that I would ... relax . They told me I needed connection . A friend . I don 't want to be alone . And somehow you 're supposed to help me . I wouldn 't help you if my life depended on it . It 's not your life you should be concerned about . Gretchen . Let 's get this over with . You don 't have to hurt Gretchen . I promise that you will see her again just as soon as you help me answer my question . Here is what I 've been thinking . You and me . We got a lot in common . We 're both adopted ... Abandoned by parents who didn 't want us . And raised by parents who didn 't understand us . My parents understand me just fine . Stop lying to yourself . Both of our dads were cold-blooded killers . Which is ironic , because you and i ... Cannot be killed . I get it . Okay , we have a few arbitrary things in common . What is your point ? My point is they 're not arbitrary . They 're formative . The basic building blocks of our lives , and we have the same blocks . Yet , here we are ... Content college co-ed , and me . How did we end up so different ? You want to know what the difference is ? You 're a psychopath . Mystery solved . You think this is a game ? This is my life . You 're supposed to help me . Or don 't you care how many filets I slice your ... roommate into ? If you 're not gonna contribute , I 'll just have to take the answers from your head . You 're gonna slice my head open again ? I 've evolved way beyond that . My friend Lydia gave me a much more precise instrument . She could read someone just by touching them . See into the very depths of their soul . Of course , her methods were a little hyper-erotic , but ... Ah , what the hell . It is college , isn 't it ? The dress suits you . What 's that ? A strawberry milkshake . Your favorite . Well ... That was a long time ago . How about this one ? The last time I crashed in your dorm room , we talked all night . Among other things . We talked about your dream home . That was the Tequila talking . " A peaceful cottage surrounded by nature and happiness . " You 're such a romantic . Actually , that 's something I 've admired about you . But there comes a time when you have to realize that you 're never gonna have that cottage . Says who ? Can you honestly tell me you don 't you look back at our time together with a hint of fondness ? Mm . What 's your prognosis ? Not good . The witness has identified Hiro Nakamura , who 's clearly and selfishly interfered with the timeline . Just so I 'm clear ... On your personal scale of temporal justice , it 's okay , so long as no one gets hurt ? Yes . That is my definition . That 's good to know . Because I believe my next witness is here . Just tell me where she is . Claire Bennet . You 've been holding out on me . What are you talking about ? Why I was supposed to find you , you and I are the same . I am nothing like you . You do exactly what I do . You use this ... gift , this curse , whatever it is , to build walls . Make it impossible to actually connect with another person . Like Gretchen . God , all those memory hits I got from your stuff while I was tying her up ... Have such a different context now . Everything in that room is so full of ... Pauses . What did you say ? Pauses . All these moments so ripe with subtext . " Can I borrow your book ? " " Cut my hand with these scissors . " All these interactions , and you still can 't say the one thing you really want to say to this girl . Heck ... You keep this up , you might end up alone forever too . You don 't know what you 're talking about . I think I do . The indestructible girl who can 't put herself out there to get hurt . What ? No angry retort ? Ah ! You 're right , you are off your game . You just told me exactly where she is . How many people have I killed ? Hundreds , I suppose . And all of this because of an agreement you made with the defendant ? Yep . He told me if I saved the waitress I could have the cheerleader , and anybody else I wanted to kill . And as long as you saved his girlfriend you could kill some more . - Willy-Nilly . - Willy-Nilly . Seems to me that a lot of people were hurt as a result of Mr. Nakamura 's time tampering . Really ? Does this look right to you ? Tell me again , who else met their death by your hand after Hiro made this deal ? Well , there was her . And Eden ... ish . Two Primatech guards . The melty guy , the mechanic , Isaac Mendez , my mother , some guy named Ted something ... Ted ... And so on , and so on . If Hiro was acting out of an ability , perhaps he should have stopped this vicious killer - before these countless murders ... - Sprague ! Ted Sprague . So saving Charlie wasn 't for the heroic good . It was for the good of Hiro . No . Romantic or not , Charlie was a good person ! Fair enough . Then the prosecution would like to call its final witness . Charlie Andrews . Oh , that 's right . I 've forgotten we can 't bring Charlie in because this world-improving person is lost in time . Now tell me , how did that happen again ? I made a deal with a ... I 'm sorry . You 'll have to speak up . I made a deal with a villain , and he double-crossed me . Right . Prosecution rests , your honor . " A shake roof , wraparound porch , " and a Stone path leading to a lake where the sun glistens over the water . " How 'd you remember all of that ? I have my ways . I know all the details . By heart , it would seem . Hard to forget . I was holding you close to me , and the way you painted it , it made it so real , like it came from your soul . Like ... like it was you . You always know the right thing to say . You have the perfect scrap of poetry in your pocket to ... to what ? " With a big oak tree in the yard , surrounded by wildflowers . " " And a couple of rocking chairs on the deck to watch the sun set . " You do remember . " With a fireplace to keep us warm . " " And a summer breeze to keep us cool . " How do you do it ? Hm ? Every ... single ... time . This is so beautiful . How did you do it ? My friends and I can do the most amazing things . Look . There 's your dream cottage . No more traveling now . We 'll make it a home . A real home . For me , for you . If you 'll have me . Oh ... Sam ! You said you couldn 't join a carnival . And now you don 't have to . There 's no more carriage homes , no more main homes , just ... just that . Away from everything . It 's what you talked about . It could be our life . I can 't live here . But you said ... I know , I know , I know , I know what I said . It 's just ... It 's just , I didn 't think you 'd actually ... - actually do it ? - Yeah . But ... I mean ... This dress , and the milkshake , and ... All of this , this is a fantasy . And I made it come true . For you . No , Sam . For you . This is your fantasy . And it 's ... it 's beautiful . And I 'm happy for you . But it isn 't me . My life isn 't here . But I changed everything for ... no , don 't tell me you did all this for me . Please , don 't ... don 't tell me this was all for me . No , of course not . Listen , um , I should get you back home . Thank you for indulging me . No , Sam . No , it was really ... it was really nice to see you again . Gretchen ? Gretchen . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . All things considered . I 'm so sorry , this is all my fault . You never should 've gotten caught up in it . I 'm just ... I 'm happy you 're here . And that it 's over . It is over , isn 't it ? No . He 's not done ... somewhere out in the open ? No , he 'll be expecting that , he 's trying to flush us out . How do you know ? 'Cause apparently I get the way he thinks . - Someone 's coming ! - In here . So Sylar , huh ? The Sylar ? Yes . Well , no . Kind of the emo-apologist version . He 's had me trying to figure out what his issues are . Seriously ? How 'd that go ? Pencil in the eye . Listen , I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Getting used to being all perils of Pauline . No , not about that . Well , yes , about that . But ... About breakfast . About sometimes keeping you at arm 's length . It 's cool . Are you kidding ? - If you don 't want to ... - I do want to . I just ... I 'm scared . And I get afraid that I 'm gonna get hurt , and so I use my specialness to build these walls , instead of , you know , jumping off bridges . I suck at metaphors , but what I 'm trying to say - is that ... - It 's okay , really . No . No , it 's not . This guy , Sylar , he sat there and told me that we 're very much alike , and he 's not wrong . And I 'm afraid that I 'm gonna end up alone for the rest of my life like him . And I don 't know how to fix it . Do you want to talk about it ? I like to think of myself as just a girl who happens to have powers . And it 's just one thing in a list of attributes ... loyal , friendly , regenerative , good skin , you know ? You do have good skin . But when you put the chips down and life gets tough , I hide behind that one label , that one attribute . And I close myself off . Man , no wonder Sylar 's so messed up . I can only imagine what having a bunch of excuses could do to someone 's humanity . Maybe that 's his answer . In order to become human again , he has to get rid of all of his powers . Yeah , maybe . Now was that so hard ? You son of a bitch . Where is she ? It 's dinnertime . I imagine she 's right where you left her . You never took her ? Like I said , I 've been having a little trouble being myself . Gretchen ? Oh ! You 're okay ! Yeah ! Of course I 'm okay . Well , some guy stole my backpack , but what 's with you ? Nothing , I 'm fine . And then you 're here . - And you 're all right . - Claire . - You 're acting really weird . - I 'm sorry . I 'm really lucky to have you . And I 'm sorry about this morning . Forget it . You know me , impulsive Gretchen wants to hold hands so she does it . I know . And I love that about you . And I wanna be more like that , and not be beholden to any label , or definition , or who I 'm supposed to be . I just ... I wanna hold your hand . People are gonna start to talk . Let them talk . Talking 's good . In fact , I could use some talking if you still have a sympathetic ear . I , in fact , have two ears . Come on . Objection , your honor ! He 's reciting the opening to quantum leap . We need to shock him . Give him 200 joules . Charging . Clear ! No response . - 240 . - Bring it up . Charging . Clear ! Still nothing . Start compression . We 're losing him . Still no pulse , we 're losing him . Let 's shock him again . Charging . Clear . Not so fast , Carp . We got a pulse . He 's coming back . He 's rising . Is something wrong , sir ? Yes , something is wrong . Am I scaring you ? Do I look scary ? Sir , I just wanted to know if ... you don 't think I can see how you 're looking at me right now ? That I 'm different ? Looking down your nose at me ? Like I 'm not good enough ! I 'm done trying to change myself for you , trying to fit into your world , play by your rules . From now on , you 're gonna play by mine . Yeah . Just a minute ! Can I help you ? Hey . Hey , buddy . How are you ? I 'm sorry , I 'm Gabriel . A friend of Matt 's , 12th precinct . Oh , I 'm sorry , he 's not here right now . Oh , um ... Is there any way that you could tell me where he is ? It 's really important that I speak with him . Sure . I 'm sorry , have we met ?

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Four Regents suffered artifact-related deaths . And now a fifth Regent . How can my mom be a Regent and not have told me ? Just let me start at the beginning . Some other time , Jane- - a time when the Warehouse isn 't under attack and someone isn 't trying to kill you . - Artie said you don 't torture . - I 'm not Artie . I can 't let you do this . I drew my gun on Mrs. Frederic , and she fired me . What ? - You hear that ? - No . Sounds like somebody 's in trouble . You want trouble , mister ? Hold that thought , I beg of you . Hey , you okay ? No . Don 't . Hello ? Aah ! Oh , my God ! Paul ? Paul ! Paul ... Aah ! ♪ Warehouse 13 3x10 ♪ Insatiable Original Air Date on September 19 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = So you just let my mom walk out- - I don 't get to make her stay . There is a hierarchy here . There 's your mother , the Regent , Mrs. Frederic , there 's me , and then there 's you . Oh , sorry . How rude . There 's me , there 's Trailer , and then there 's you . Okay , so how do we protect her from Walter Sykes if she 's not here ? Her security has been tripled . She 's safe . The Remati Shackle is safe . The Warehouse is safe . The world is safe . The Universe is safe . And by the way , no one asked us to help , so I don 't think that we- - Regent security has been stretched pretty thin- - Myka , please ! Please , not you , too . Now , I have a situation here that I would like to- - Artie , Sykes has been planning his revenge The Regents are handling it . Let it go . Walter Sykes needs to be brought to justice . Ah , see , you 're not looking for justice . You 're looking for vengeance . If some psycho tried to off your mother , wouldn 't you want payback ? You never met my mother . Our job is to do our job . And , oh , look , we have a ping . So go pack . And you are gonna go to Ithaca , New York . Bye . Artie , he does have a point . Right , Ithaca . Bye . Leena- - look at this . Someone 's actually doing as requested . How is the security-system upgrade going ? Down to one last diagnostic . Once I run this , we 're good to go . Good . Sykes is looking for weaknesses , best not to have any . So is Claudia still upset about Steve ? I was hoping that a few days away from this place would clear her mind . Artie , what happened in Atlanta ? Something bad ... Between Steve and Mrs. Frederic . A notice was issued to all government agencies that Jinks was persona non grata . They burned his credit rating and his passport . - Oh , my God . - Don 't tell Claudia . I won 't . - ♪ I 'm your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb ♪ ♪ hello , world , I 'm your wild girl ♪ ♪ I 'm your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb ♪ ♪ cherry bomb , cherry bomb ♪ ♪ ♪ Okay , thanks . That was awesome . Johnny Cash , Astrid Gilberto , and The Runaways in the same set . That 's my motto . Go eclectic or go home . Yeah , I like to mix it up on open-mic night . Claudia , right ? I 'm Dwayne Maddox . Lead singer / guitarist for Dead Rent- - great band , terrible name . - So you 've seen us . " South Dakota 's most promising musical export , " sayeth the blogs . That was before the rhythm guitarist decided to split . He wanted us to be the next Black Eyed Peas . I wanted to be Black Flag . Just ... Wow . That 's a weird coincidence . I know exactly what it 's like to lose a partner . I was wondering if you 'd like to fill in . Okay . Um ... Wow . So when do you- - when do you think you want to jam ? I mean , my schedule is just a little unpredictable , so ... Well , we rehearse in my garage . It 's the red house behind the body shop . - Say noon tomorrow ? - Yeah , that could work . All right , see you then . Hey , what 's up ? This is Steve . Leave a message . Damn it , Jinksy , call me back . I want to share . So you and Paul were both bitten , but neither of you saw what did it ? It was really dark , and it was really fast . Then something got its attention . I dragged us both into the car and took off . May I ? Sorry . Thank you . Myka , do you know what those are ? Some kind of animal maybe . Human bite marks- - they 're human . Vampire or werewolf ? I don 't know , but based on the location , I would say- - wait a minute , do you really think that- - No , I don 't think ! We deal with artifacts , not fairy tales . A lot of those artifacts come from fairy tales , okay ? Cinderella 's knife , right ? Turns people to glass , remember ? I 'm just saying it 's possible . Well , I 'll believe it when I see it . Let 's check out lovers lane . Okay , but I only go to third base . Okay , so Amy said Paul heard a moaning coming from that direction . I 'm gonna go that way . You stay here . What ? Alone ? Okay . This isn 't a horror movie , Pete . Uh , yeah , see , see ? Now it 's a horror movie . Myka . Myka ... What are you doing ? I was worried about you in here all alone . Wait , wait , wait . Do you hear that ? Yeah . What in the hell ? Why is that man eating a deer ? Probably because ... That man is a zombie . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Oh , afraid of guns , huh ? Hold up , zombies aren 't afraid of guns . That 's because he 's not a zombie . He 's probably just been affected by something that we know is real- - an artifact . Maybe if we just- - we talk to him ... No , no , no , no , no . No , you don 't talk to the living dead . You either run away really fast , or you shoot ' em in the head . Pop , pop ! Sir , I 'm Agent Bering . This is Agent Lattimer . We 're with the Secret Service . Okay , we just want to help you . Do you- - do you understand me ? Aah ! Myka ! Cover me . Easy . God , he 's really cold . Yeah , further proof that he 's not alive . Careful . Careful . Myka ! - It only takes one bite . - Will you be quiet ? Aha . All right , we have ... Kevin Monroe , 36 years old . Lives here in town at 127 Briarwood Lane . All right , well , does he have anything artifact-y on him ? Well , not that I can see . Let 's get him to a hospital . Artie , will you please tell Pete that the undead do not exist ? Don 't be ridiculous . - Of course they exist . - Thank you . What ? - What ? - Told you . Only in the technical sense . Ha ha . I told you . There are several artifacts known to simulate living death . Show me the victim . Hmm , necrotic dermal discoloration , and around his mouth , hyper-stimulation of the salivary glands . Off the bat , I 'd say he 's got two symptoms that are consistent- - Peas ... Elk ... Bison ! Pete , look in his eyes . That 's not anger . That 's--that 's fear . It kind of sounded like he said , " Peas , Elk , Bison . " Yeah , well , at least there 's some vegetables in there . Artie , listen , the doctor said that he had frostbite on his toes and ears , but Ithaca 's been in the middle of a heat wave . Yeah , check out his house . I am on the next flight out . And whatever you do , you keep him restrained . Hold down the fort . I thought I had two days off . Leena 's busy . I 'm getting on a plane . I need you to do some research . Everything we 've got on living-death artifacts . Yeah , Artie , you specifically forbade me- - I changed my mind . I 'm mercurial . Deal with it . Yeah , not exactly the adjective I 'd choose right now . Come on , Steve , pick up the- - What , Claudia ? Oh , my God . Jinksy ! I can 't- - wow . I 've , um- - I 've just been dying to talk to you . Yeah , I could tell from the last 800 messages . Okay , it wasn 't that many . What do you want ? Um , okay , Cliffsnotes version- - I met this really hot musician at open-mic yesterday . Pretty sure he wants me . Pretty sure I want him . I mean , I know I 've only known this guy less than 24 hours , but how can you tell ? What if he 's my one ? Claudia , I can 't do this . What ? Talk to your B.F.F.E. ? What the hell is a B.F.F.E. ? Best friend forever and ever . Look , we 're not B.F.F.E.s. We were co-workers , and now we 're not , which makes us ... Nothing . Nothing ? Steve , why would you- - I can 't be any clearer , Claudia . Stop calling me . Lose my number . Yeah , Steve , no problem . I 'll just forget everything about our awesome friendship if you 'll just tell me , why are you being such a tool ? ♪ ♪ Okay ... I 'll bite . Okay , Sallah . Wasn 't really the question . She raised her eyebrow at this and walked on . Yep . Oh--oh , God , wow . Hello from Miami Beach . 90 degrees . He was obviously freezing . Why ? You scope out the living room . I 'm gonna see if I can stand the heat in the kitchen . Pete , you hear that ? Secret Service ! Come on out with your hands up ! - Locked . - Psst . Hey . Hey , it 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm Myka . Everything 's gonna be okay . - Mykes . - Yeah ? Peas , Elk , Bison . " Please help my son . " - Hey , Artie . - Hey , listen , do we have- - Pete , what are you doing with this- - - Artie ... - Who- - - Come here . - Who is this ? Well , this is Kevin Monroe 's son . We found him hiding in the closet . - Hiding ? - Mm . Was he there when his father was affected ? Did he- - did he see the artifact ? We have no idea . The kid hasn 't said a word . The only reason we know his name is from a tag on his backpack . Artie , this is Danny . Danny , Artie . Hey . How are you ... ? I 'm sure it 's not the eyebrows . What do you mean ? Hey , buddy . Hey , you know , your dad 's just- - he 's just taking a nap . I got an idea . How about you and me go get a candy bar ? So how is his dad doing ? Well , he 's sedated for now . Amy and Paul , the couple from the woods--any symptoms ? Nothing yet , but listen to this . I think whatever affected Kevin Monroe is spreading . Now , a few minutes ago , campus police at SUNY-Ithaca got this call from the Psi Phi Zeta frat house . Listen to this . Send someone over here now . He 's crazy . He ate a squirrel , and he keeps trying to bite me . Get the hell away from me ! Okay , now , it 's a frat house , but still , the artifact could be there . But how did Kevin Monroe come into contact with it ? - Was he an alumnus or- - - I 'm still working on that . But right now we just have to contain this thing . - Yeah . - Hey . Okay , we have to go . I 'll explain on the way . Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . Artie , um ... - What about Danny ? - Who ? - The kid . - Oh , what about him ? Artie , we--we just found him cowering in a closet by him- - he can 't be left alone . You got to stay with him . - Yeah . - Me ? No . I don 't- - I have no idea . He probably saw something , right ? Talk to him . Get him to open up . Yeah , show him some of that papa Nielsen charm . - Don 't touch me ! - Okay . Um , all right , uh , you go check out Animal House , and I 'll ... Cajole . - Good luck . - Yeah . - Good game . - Uhh ! See what you can find out from the frat boys . I 'll make sure the campus gendarmes give us some space . Agent Bering . Somebody fill me in . Fenton Wallis , house president . Everyone just calls me Wally . - So what happened here ? - Moose freaked . A moose ? One of our newbies- - came back from a burrito run whining about being cold . Then he starts eating all the food , then all of a sudden , he just goes psycho , starts trying to bite people . Did you see him actually bite anyone ? Lady , after he took a swipe at me , all I saw was the basement door slam shut . I think he 's still down there tearing through the pantry . - Hey . - Hey . So we got ten minutes before the boys in blue show up . Let 's go find us an artifact . Okay . 30 guys under one roof , and no one takes the time to change a lightbulb . Are you asking me how many frat boys it takes to change a lightbulb ? - Because I would say ... - Please don 't . Well ... Ooh , tacos . Oh , man , I hope that truck 's still out there . Don 't start with me , okay ? My blood sugar is crashing . Oh , jeez ! Ooh ! Dude , I hate rats . Cold ... So hungry . Help me . Help me . Moose , listen , it 's gonna be okay . Aah ! Myka ! Aah ! - Are you okay ? Huh ? - Yeah . Yeah . - Did he get you ? - No , no , I 'm fine . Let 's just , uh--just get him to the hospital . Is it safe to come out ? Aaah ! Aah- - - Are you okay ? - It bit me , Mykes . It bit me . - How long ago was he bitten ? - A few minutes ago . How long before the effects kick in ? No idea . Amy and Paul were bitten hours ago , and they 're both still asymptomatic . So it could take anywhere from three minutes to ... to never happening at all . It depends on the artifact . Do you have any leads ? Uh , no . I 'm still working on it . Work faster ! And , Myka , Myka ... If he gets a strange look ... Watch yourself . Was Moose from Ithaca ? Was he related to a Kevin Monroe ? Wisconsin . His last name 's Mulder . Was Kevin Monroe ever pledged to this house , say , around 15 years ago ? We only got chartered last year . Myka . Listen , uh ... When it happens , I want you to be the one who puts me down . Okay . I know it 's not gonna be- - wait . Wait . What ? Two shots to the head , right ? Pop , pop . - Mykes ... - Everything 's gonna be fine . Okay ? I 'll drop you off at the hospital . Wait , wait . No , no , no , no , no . I 'm not just gonna sit around waiting for it to happen . Okay ? I mean , I 'm gonna make sure we find this thing . Make it stop . Make it stop . It 's too bright . Oh , my eyes ! Oh , make it stop . Make it stop . Wait . They 're sensitive to light . Remember Kevin Monroe , in the woods ? He flinched from our flashlights . - Oh , sorry . I 'm just- - I 'm freakin ' starving . A human flesh kind of starving , that--that kind of starving or ... ? No , like Pete Lattimer starving . It 's just I can 't do this on an empty stomach . - I 'm gonna go get a taco . - Really ? Now ? Hola , amigo . Uh , una burrito grande especial ... Por favor , rapido . Gracias . Comprende ? Yeah , I get it , gringo . I speak English , bro . Okay , well , I 'm just , you know ... - Pete . - Yeah . At Kevin Monroe 's house , it was hot , right ? - It was , like , 90 degrees . - Yeah . And they said Moose was freezing . Right , so I 'm thinking that the artifact works in stages . Well , that 's how zombies work , Mykes . You know , there 's the blood bite , sickness , death , rotting . And then all you want to do is , like ... Gracias , senor . Seis dolares . Pay the man , Mykes . Okay . Orale , homes . I 'm coming back for seconds . This is delicious . Okay , that 's , like , 28 bucks you owe me now . Can I get a special ? So , Danny ... Any interest in cryptography ? Piano nocturnes ? 'Cause they 're--no . Cold War espionage . Yeah . Ecch . Um , right . I 'm gonna go check on your dad . You stay put . What--what 's happening ? He 's going through I.V. bags almost as fast as I can hang ' em . If that wasn 't weird enough , there 's no clear sign of infection , viral or bacterial . He is ice cold . Last reading , body temp was 89 and dropping . If we don 't reverse this , he 's gonna go into organ failure . Excuse me . Oh , come on . Again ? Oh ! Ow ... No ! Oh ... Of course . Yo . Claudia , did you get the information that I asked you- - Yes ! What do you thi- - of course ! Yes ! Claudia , is everything all right ? Just a little temporary , possibly terminal technical difficulties- - all good now . Claudia ... What is wrong ? Nothing . Quit worrying , Nana . So , listen , on the shelf , we have the Torch of Thanatos , Marie Laveau 's crucifix , and the Bodhidharma 's slippers . But unfortunately , that 's all I can tell you until this search speeds up . So any new deets ? Causes extreme metabolic shifts and temperature drops , while simultaneously triggering intense carnivorous craving . Cravings . Well , I 'll cross-ref when I can to see what pops , but the network 's been uber-sluggish lately . It 's weird , actually . I don 't know . Well , call me when you get something , and then you can resume your RR . Thank you . Yes , Leena ? Yes , I know someone named Dwayne . He 's where now ? Dwayne . Hey . You 're ... You 're where I live . Yeah , I , uh , asked around . Look , if you 're not into joining the band ... I mean , that would suck , but--but I get it . And I was just still hoping that we could- - Not into- - no , wait . What ? Well , when you blew off rehearsal , I just assumed- - No , no . Oh , no , no , no , no , no . That was not rejection . That was me trying to juggle , and I 'm all thumbs . So , um , okay , I just have one more little thing I have to do at work , okay ? And then I 'm all yours . - I mean to rehearse . - Yeah . Oh , my God . Let me just go get my guitar , and then I 'll go straight to- - whoa ! Hey- - - Dwayne ! I 've never had a hot rocker girl literally throw herself at me before . Look out ! Oh , my God . Are you guys all right ? Uh , yeah , yeah . Fine . Great , actually . Oh , my God . I cannot believe this . - Claudia , what 's wrong ? - I got to get out of here . Claudia , wait . I just- - You need to stay as far away from me as possible right now--trust me . - Why ? Because I 'm marked for death . 76 and still dropping . If we don 't get his body temperature up , this man is gonna be dead in an hour . I 'm gonna talk to the doctor about putting him on bypass . The doctor 's on his way back to the- - Good . It stopped dropping . Maybe he 's stabilizing . It 's not gonna last . Where did those glasses come from ? Alfred Butz , inventor of the thermostat . Huh ? Uh ... great Uncle Alfie 's glasses . Same prescription , oddly . I 'm gonna go check on the two kids who were attacked in the woods . Oh , well , those two were patched up and discharged hours ago . They were bitten ... and they 're fine . That means something else caused- - Hey , stop him ! Help me out here . Kid ate through the restraints . Aah ! Why do they crank the A.C. in here ? Really ? 'Cause I 'm sweating my- - - Aah ! - That was Moose . Stop him ! Everybody out ! Get out , now ! Let 's go ! Get out of there ! Get out ! Come on ! Take the shot , Mykes . Mykes , take the shot ! Where 'd you go ? I-I don 't know . So ... Hungry . Oh , man , don 't make me do this . Don 't come any closer . Just stop right there . Don 't- - don 't come any closer . I will shoot you ! Is he ... ? Hypothermia , starvation . So what , I 'm gonna freeze to death ? - You feeling cold ? - No , but I 've been bitten . There 's nothing wrong with you . Whatever this artifact is , its effects are not spread by biting . Thank God . You hear that , Mykes ? I 'm so cold . I don 't want to be one of the undead . And I don 't want you ... putting me down . Look , we are gonna find this thing , Myka . You 're gonna be okay . I promise . Okay . She must have come in contact with the artifact . Yeah , but where- - the woods , Kevin 's place , the frat house ? What do we know ? Stage one--sever chills . Stage two- - intense hunger . Stage three- - hypothermia , malnutrition . Stage four--death . I mean , come on , Artie , you have to have some idea what we 're dealing with here . Everyone that 's been impacted by this artifact is either too far gone to talk or dead . Not everyone . Hey . You know , Danny , my dad was once really sick , too , and I spent the whole time at the hospital just wishing that there was something I could do to help . Bet you know how that feels . Yeah . But you can help , and not just your dad . There are other people in trouble , too . Do you want to give her the magic glasses ? No , Danny , I 'll be fine . Thank you , though . Okay , how can I help ? Did your dad come in contact with any strange things lately ? Any weird--weird- - nothing . Do you remember when he first started feeling cold ? - Last night after dinner . - What 'd he eat for dinner ? He wanted to try the new burger place , but the line was too long , so we just stopped at a food truck on the way home . Tacos ? Tacos , Danny ? Tacos from here , Danny ? Yeah , Manny 's . He 's nice . Artie , something on that truck is altering the food . Kevin and Moose both ate there . Myka , what did you eat ? Off the truck ? Who am I , Pete ? Okay , fine . But still , that truck must be the nexus , and the artifact 's got to be there . - We got to find the truck . - I 'm on it . I just started following Manny 's on Twitter today . See , sometimes being obsessed with food and social networking is a good thing . - Pete . - Okay . His last Tweet was from a construction site nearby . - Let 's go . Wait , wait , wait . Myka . Myka ... Don 't you think you should stay here ? I 'm not gonna stay here waiting to turn , okay ? I-I want to be there when we find it . I 'm gonna drive . It 'll--it 'll keep me focused . Any excuse to drive . All right , just go . So ... Was your dad okay ? Oh , he was fine . No , no , he ... Everything turned out just fine . He 's still a pain in the butt . All right , mister all-seeing , all-knowing , I 'm sorry I doubted you . You obviously know what 's what . Otherwise , you wouldn 't be here , right ? So I got to know , am I really gonna die tonight ? Okay . Obviously I didn 't enunciate . Am I going to die tonight ? Okay . It 's on . It 's bath time . Ooh , slippery , isn 't it ? Yeah , get you some . Oh-ho-ho ! In your face , Grim Reaper ! Adieu . What a day . Oh , come on . Whoa . Water 's not supposed to do that . Somebody ? Leena ? Somebody ? Anybody ! Help me ! Help ! Thank God he 's still here . Yep . I 'm gonna crank this baby up to 11 ... Just in case we- - - I 'm so cold . - Myka ... And I 'm hungry . I need to eat . Aah ! Oh , it 's happening to you . Aah ! Myka , snap out of it . Myka ! You all ate Mexican ? It 's Pete . Myka ! Okay . All right . Okay . Aah ! Myka , don 't hate me for this , but ... Keys- - no keys . What the ... ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Okay , breathe . Breathe slowly , Claudia . Breathe . It 's okay . No , it 's not , okay ? Everything is not okay . Some psycho has the Warehouse in his sights . My best friend wants nothing to do with me . And now the Sultan of Suckwad over there is trying to kill me . Oh , yeah , it 's all rainbows and unicorns . And on top of that , why am I dry ? It 's an artifact , Claudia . Watch . Sallah , what will I have for dinner ? " That blemish is probably cancer . " What the hell kind of fortune is that ? Sallah 's not a fortune-teller . He 's more of a hypnotist . He instills an overwhelming feeling of dread into anyone who activates him . Okay , so how do I beat him , then ? You have to actively ignore him . Like I do with Artie ? Yep . So I 'm not gonna die ? Not on Sallah 's timetable anyway . Yeah ? Claudia , I need you to hack into the Ithaca power grid ! Do it now ! I 'm about to become dinner . O-okay , doing it . Nope . Okay , I 'm in . Now what ? All right , they 're sensitive to light . Can you--can you make it bright out here ? Say no more . Here comes the sun . Manny , you open this door . How do I know you 're not one of them ? Damn , the circuits blew . Manny ! Open the door , or they 're gonna eat me alive ! What the hell is going on ? What 's wrong with those people ? Something in this truck turned them into cannibals . So they spiked my tires because they want to eat me ? Where did you get this ? Uh , I was hiking in Utah . I saw it buried in the ground . I thought it 'd be a nice souvenir . Myka , put money in here . Did those workers tip you ? Yeah , I should 've put it out sooner . This is it . This is the artifact . Damn it , I don 't have any static bags ! What the hell 's a static bag ? Oh , man , I 'm not supposed to do this ! Cover your eyes ! Myka ? Please tell me I didn 't eat anyone . Okay . I don 't know what you two did , but nice work . In the winter of 1846 , a caravan of men , women , and children stranded in the Sierra Nevada Mountains were forced to resort to the most extreme measures just to survive . Somehow , the horrific ordeals of the Donner party imbued an ordinary jar with the power to make others experience what they were suffering . And putting money in the jar triggered it . - But why ? - Well , interesting sidebar- - the jar was one of several the survivors used to bury their money . Even in the grim shadow of death ... They were putting a little something away for a rainy day . Where 's Pete ? Oh , he 's waiting for us at the Univille Diner . It 's all-you-can-eat pancakes . Breakfast is on him .

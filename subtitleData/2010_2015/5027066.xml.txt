 Long ago , there was said to be a beast called the wolf . What the hell are you guys doing ? That is a sacred object . What are you talking about ? You can apologise with your death . Loups = Garous My mornings begin with safe , reassuring SVC synthetic food . It 's hard to believe , but they say a long time ago , humans killed animals and ate them . Talk of the social system being uncivilised and barbaric is a story already 30 years old . We are brought up to uphold this social system and before long we 're adults defending it . But what would happen if we didn 't become adults ? Are you in contact with your friends from your new group ? No , not yet ... In this day and age in which monitor education has become the norm it is not unusual for a child like you to have resistance to real communication . Ls that so ? It 's because children who live alone have grown in number . That 's why we counsellors have been assigned as your advisors by the community centre . I see ... First , establish real contact with children in your new group . Then , let 's try and broaden your network little by little from there . Even though it was being told to me , it never really registered . I only knew the world within the frame . The sky , the sea were both as real as they were make-believe . Even though this seems more real ... Kono . Kono Ayumi , was a kid who moved to this area in the spring . Even though he 's supposed to be in the same group as me , he 's in a world of his own . That 's what I sensed , at least . Makino ! What are you doing ? - Ah ... Tsuzuki ? - Right ! I 'm Tsuzuki Mio , the genius in Group 21 the same as you . Nice to meet you ! Nice to meet you . So ... What were you just doing ? Kono . - Secret photo ? - No ! Hey ! Kono ! Come take a look at this ! Makino snapped a secret photo of you ! You like me , Makino ? Or were you just monitoring me ? That was ... " Monitoring " is bit of an exaggeration , don 't you think ? I wonder . But we are being monitored , are we not ? By that machine . Storage device . We are used to being constantly watched , wherever and whenever , by the eyes of the system placed all over town . I loathe anyone having more concern than necessary . Therefore ... Well , then . I want to get right down to business . A body was found in the C2 area . The victim , Kawabata Ryu ... There was a report from the prefectural police that it was a child from this centre . The prefectural police are requesting full cooperation in the investigation . In this centre , we must follow this . There 's no significance to this , is there ? Well then , each counsellor is conducting creation management ... I want copies of detailed data on the children immediately . What is it , Fuwa Shizue ? Presenting the data one has of a child to you or an outside party without the consent of the guardian contradicts the rules of our office . Well , Fuwa , you see ... This is a supra-legal measure . - Oh ? - Who are you ? Division R , Prefectural Police Criminal investigation Violent Crime Administrator in Charge , Ishida Riichiro . This time , the murder occurred in the C2 area . From the victim 's actions and communication records , we were able to see ample evidence related to character deformation . The task force has decided to proceed with investigation based on his direct association with these people . I appreciate your cooperation . Is it no use , whatever he says ? Yeah . It 's useless . It 's because Ishida is the great-grandchild of SVC 's founder . It 's the decision of a man of power in this kind of town . I doubt anyone can oppose him . Kunugi , why are you here ? I came to retrieve some data . I was ordered by designated media ... Where 'd I put it ? R Prefectural Police 2 To copy records , you see . So you didn 't come to see me , I guess . Sorry to have ditched you for a couple of weeks . As of today , I 'm in charge of incidents in this area . I surely never thought that this would involve serial murderers . Ah ... My bad . Did I make you remember your mother ? Please don 't connect me with mother . Mixi Even though I was counselling the serial murder suspect , the murderer was trying to commit a double suicide . Kunugi ... You shouldn 't speak ill of the dead . It was me ... Even though I was the one in charge of that incident , it ended like that . I think it 's shameless . You wanted a copy of that data , right ? Yeah . How was the Centre ? Right . I was able to talk to some friends today . That 's good news . That makes me happy , too . Ls something wrong , Hazuki ? Well ... When will you come and see me again ? I have the parliament this month , so it 'll have to be Wednesday this month , as planned . Is there a problem ? No . Well , Hazuki ... Because a dangerous incident has occurred , get to bed after you 've double-checked the door . OK . Good night , Uncle . Good night . I bet he won 't be able to come next month either . What ? Ls someone there ? Who is it ? Hey ! Tsuzuki . How 'd you get in here ? I used magic . Magic ? Yeah . Magic . Ah , now that you mention it ... Ah , me ? Not you . Behind you . The monitor . Try projecting images from the storage device in this room . OK . Huh ? Why ? Why aren 't you showing up ? In this world in which we leave everything to the system , a genius like me who can do anything to the system , is something of a wizard . You see ? Why my place ? Well , that 's because I saw that . My home monitor ? Music , start ! What is that ? A group training problem . I was thinking of doing that . I thought I 'd consult you during afternoon training . Mail would be just fine . Come on , it 's communication . Communication . So ... Yabe was absent today , right ? I thought I 'd tell Yabe myself , so I went to her place . It seems like the police are also looking for Yabe . The police ? For Yabe ? Yep . That 's why I thought I 'd go looking for her . Why ? " Why ? " Because we 're friends . Friends ? Let 's get going ! You 're my friend , too , aren 't you ? Good . It 's been decided . First off , we 'll go to Kono 's . What ? Kono 's place ? Tsuzuki ! Um ... The monitor ... The monitor ... - Thirty seconds , OK ? - Thirty seconds ? The time it takes to work my magic . In that time we become invisible ! The power went out ! The magic is beginning to work . So that 's it . Here we go ! Go ? - There 's no time ! - No time ? Tsuzuki , what are you ... I 'll go first . Ah , wait ! Ls everything all right ? The thing about this magic is , even though you can trick machines ' eyes , you can 't fool the human eye . OK , let 's move on out ! But the area patrol ... if we look at the GPS ... Huh ? I can 't use the monitor . It 's cos I put a magic spell on it . If you use the monitor , they 'll know where you are , right ? - Oh , right . - Right ! We can experience anything ! Anything ! - Here we go ! - Ah , right ! But if we don 't use GPS , aren 't you nervous about getting lost ? We 'll be fine , fine ! Your destination is not what the system decides , but the result of your choice on which way to go . That 's why we 're walking now , right ? We 're aiming for Kono 's place , you know . Yes , but ... - Here ? - Right ! Kono Kiyomi Kono Ayumi Kono doesn 't seem to be at home . Did he go out somewhere ? Out somewhere at this hour ? That 's not very sensible of him . But , we 're just the same ... Tsuzuki ! Hey ! Don 't just leave me here . Hey ! I 'm up here ! Up where ? Kono . What can you see up there ? The sky . There 's nothing there . Things that don 't exist ... Things you can 't see ... That 's so philosophical . Did you come here to talk philosophy ? No , to talk about our training performance . Vigilance ! I thought I 'd do that PV . You came here for that with Makino along for the ride ? Um ... I ... I thought Makino wanted to see you . Let 's communicate a little , huh . - And Yabe ? - Yabe ? I stopped by her place . She 's nowhere to be found . The police accessed her home monitor log . Also Sakura Hinako in the same class . I don 't know this Nakamura , but he accessed it . Maybe he 's police . That 's a nuisance . What 's a nuisance ? If Yabe gets caught up in an incident what 'll you do then ? An incident ? Didn 't Yabe just go away ? It 's a question of probability . - Haven 't you heard of those serial murders ? - Yeah . Do you know who got killed ? You don 't suppose Yabe was ? Yabe 's not dead . That 's right . She isn 't dead . The one who 's dead is that guy ! Who ? - Come take a look ! - Right . Kawabata Ryu 2019 / 11 / 12 Kawabata Ryu , 16 years old . Who 's he ? That kid in Wednesday 's class . It 's not Yabe , after all . Where 'd you pick up that data ? From the Area Police DS Records Server . Hacking ? Maybe . That 's against the law . Makino thinks so , too , I bet . You must have a communication disorder . That 's why you get so flustered . I 'm sorry . Kono , you also have a little anxiety . You 're reading your mates profiles , aren 't you ? I haven 't seen a thing . I hate concerning myself with others . But look , even so , you still found out about Yabe not being dead . That 's undisclosed information ... This here . I had real contact with the dead kid . You mean , you met Kawabata ? I met him by accident three nights ago . I often slip out of the house at night . So it was that night . It looked like Yabe was being chased by Kawabata and running for her life . Looked like ... But you didn 't even try to help ? I was just watching it . It was because my way home took the same route . Consequently , I ended up following them . Then , another person , someone wearing a mask appeared . Yabe was cornered by a setup . Did you help her then ? It wasn 't me who helped her . It was another kid . Myao ! Myao ? The one with the long hair and the continental style clothing ? Yes . She used a strange technique . Then I was dead-on . Myao was the one who helped Yabe . It was Rei Myao . So Yabe is at Myao 's place . I think you may be right . All right then ! Now let 's go see Myao . Now ? Yabe is probably having a rough time . She 's our friend , so we need to save her . I also have something to ask Myao . I 'm going . Makino , aren 't you coming ? That thing about handing over personal information , we weren 't consulted at all . - I was informed what to do today , myself . - What ? Copy Error ? Data cannot be verified . Has the data been destroyed ? I don 't think there 's anything wrong with the data itself . The monitor doesn 't exist . Who 's that kid ? Yabe Yuko . She 's under my care . She was absent today . The monitor should have GPS , right ? What about the log ? The final log was ... C Area ? That 's not all . This is the site where a body was found this morning . Prefectural Police HQ , Koizumi speaking . This is Kunugi , investigation Division 1 , Group 3 . Send me the security records for the home of the person I 'm sending . She hasn 't returned in three nights . The visitors were Sakura Hinako and Nakamura Yuji . I don 't know Nakamura but Sakura is one of my kids . As for Nakamura Yuji ... His name came up as a suspect for the serial murders . A material unsworn witness . A person we 're pursuing now . A suspect ? You can 't mean Yabe , too ? I don 't know . But Nakamura is still out there in town somewhere . Keep A Watch Out For ... So this is C Area ? Yep . You scared ? I 'm not scared , but isn 't it dangerous ? Being the redevelopment specification district , it 's an old quarter left as is . I can 't say it 's dangerous but guard robots make the rounds . Just in case . My place is right around here . Surprised ? Yes . You 're so sincere . It 's me ! Ls anyone in there ? Voice recognition . It 's a real fixer-upper . Come on in . Don 't be shy , come this way . Well , then ... This is the main body of my monitor . By monitor , you mean this ? That is also a monitor to be sure , but that device is just another name for receiver terminal . Originally , " monitor " meant to keep an eye on . Storage devices all around town and robots who monitor places where there are no storage devices , those are the guys who really keep an eye on us . Though we originally have a monitoring device , we are really the ones being watched . But , you see ... I , on the one hand , am certainly being watched , sorry to say ... So , I am keeping an eye on them , too . - What do you intend by watching them ? - Well ... if I don 't like it , I 'll bring down everything . - Do you even intend to use bombs ? - What ? Behind you . What 's that ? Turtle Number 1 . A plasma generation device . If I set that off , this whole area will go ba-boom ! But , you know , if I did something like that ... You 'd get arrested . They wouldn 't get me . This is a place where I can see the entire world . So , if I 'm here , I can find out Myao 's whereabouts . Now , listen for once . The ones who sold my friend , where are you ? Hey ! Myao ! It 's been a long time ! You 're as awesome as ever ! Did you take down all these guys single-handedly ? That 's no concern of yours . You and I are friends , right ? Don 't act like such a stranger . Who are those two ? Two ? Kono and Makino . My friends . Do you happen to know where that kid Yabe is ? I 've helped you before . If you want to know , all you had to do was ask that guy . That guy ? Kono ? I remember . You have no reason to forget . I knew it was Myao who helped out . Wrong ! Certainly I did protect the kids in your area . But the guy who did that was him . That 's odd . You lost consciousness then . You shouldn 't have been able to see a thing . Lost consciousness ? Myao ? That person certainly took down Yabe 's attacker , Kawabata , but that was all . By that was all , you mean ... Save Myao ! I don 't know the first thing about fighting . Moreover , doing something meaningless like hitting someone isn 't something I can do . Meaningless you say ? Don 't get so excited ! As to whether it 's meaningless or not , try me ! That 's also meaningless . It 's meaningful to me ! What was that ? Did that get your attention ? Is there something up there ? Merchandise . Merchandise ? This is as far as I go . What ? Tell us ! If you see , you 'll know . Well , then , I 'll have a look right now . Um ... Kono , are you going , too ? What did you come here for , Makino ? Ah ... I was invited by Tsuzuki ... Tsuzuki came to meet that Myao girl . I came here to ask Myao about Yabe . Either way , it 's of no concern to you . You should do what you want . I don 't know what you want to do even if you ask me . My monitor ... She said I can 't use it . Tsuzuki said ... it 's cos I put a magic spell on it . If you use the monitor , they 'll know where you are , right ? - Oh , right . - Right ! We can experience anything ! Anything ! You 're my friend , too , aren 't you ? Friend ... What did you come here for , Makino ? Merchandise ? Is it normal to sell people ? There are those who buy people like me who have no legal identity . - Who ? - I don 't know . Cos even the guys I took out downstairs were only middlemen , you know . And Yabe got caught up in all of this ? Yabe ? But Myao protected her . She was snatched off . Snatched off ? Everyone under this ceiling was . All of these people ? Yeah . Why ? They 're all undocumented immigrants . People who were not supposed to be here from the beginning . The police won 't budge , even if they disappear . Yep . Yabe got caught up in all that , right , Myao ? Hey ! I couldn 't very well leave her there beside the corpses . Even though I took her home and protected her , this happened . But you saved her in the end . There 's one problem , though . Problem ? If the guys who assaulted Yabe come looking for her , it 's too dangerous to return to her home . She runs the risk of being carted off from Myao 's place again . We can 't leave her here . My place is also in C Area . Whenever there 's trouble , they use the excuse of readjusting the town lots . I don 't like that . I won 't let that happen . It 's no use even if you try hard , Myao . I mean , Makino 's place is filled with security . So we can 't put her there . Even though A Area is safe , security 's too light . There 's got to be a place . That 's it ! I guess we don 't have any other options . Thank you for giving me shelter . You 're being a nuisance . Don 't say such a thing ! I am a nuisance . Don 't worry about it . We 're all friends . Friends ? What kind of friends ? These ! Teddy bears ? Teddy bears probably . Yeah , teddy bears . Are friends teddy bears ? Not that ... Ah ... This ! No , not that . Here . I seriously like it so much it hurts Uh-huh , Uh-huh Music ? A girl group from a while ago . At the Centre training , the four of us , Kono , Makino , you , and I are doing it . Koshi ! Tan-Tan ! Look ! Makino 's gonna do it , too ! - Um ... - Koshi ! Koshi . Tan ! Tan . - Tan ! - Tan . You , too , Kono . I 'm not doing that . What are you saying ? It 's a group training , if we don 't all do it together , our evaluations will fall . You 're worried about grades . It 's something adults decide , so ... Makino , you 're easy to get along with . Am I wrong ? I 'm terrible . I have a communication disorder , so ... Because we 're going to present it in front of other people . You 're doing it . We can 't do it if you refuse . But you 're communicating with me right now . You 're making this performance a job ... But ... it 's not true . Those two brought you with them here and started conversations with you , I bet . It 'll be fun ! Right , guys ! - See ? - Yeah ! Why are you guys smiling ? But , you know ... Yeah ! If something 's so funny , let me know . See , you 're fine . Yeah ! What the heck ! We 're friends , so we can 't keep secrets from each other ! - Myao , are you leaving ? - Yeah . I no longer have any reason to be here . There 's also no reason for me to protect her , either , I guess . I 'm going back where I belong . Thanks for saving me . No problem . Oh no ! - The magic 's going to wear off ! - What ? I said the magic 's going to wear off ! - The magic ? The monitor ? - There it is . I used magic on your monitor too , right ? It 's going to be lifted ! So ... So now we 're in our homes , right ? If the date and time has been switched and we 're discovered here , we 're likely to be suspected ! It 's late ! Let 's hurry and get home ! We can meet up tomorrow night again . Um ... Bye ! Ah ... I ... See you later ! Later . Let 's meet again tomorrow , OK ? Bye ! Um ... Bye ! Yeah ! Rock my heart I 'm seriously infatuated my heart 's beating so fast How 's her strategy working ? Is she feigning weakness or is she sturdy ? Ah , I don 't want to give it up that fizzy , fizzy effervescence that girl is a complete , natural fake She has a pink aura , going zoom , zoom Carelessness is a taboo it starts grinding a person night by night Turn your head , darling There 's a technique this time , especially Let 's go with our combined efforts ! Don 't you worry about the eyes all around you That 's right ! You can 't be stopped ! Wink those eyes ! Come on baby ! Here we go I , my , me , I am me You are you After you make them turn around Take care of your grudge of betrayal Wait for your chance eagerly What the hell ? I 'm not wrong . You guys are laughing ! Hey ! Stop it ! Hey ! Oh , you came . I 'll never forget . The view we experienced together that day . I 'll never forget it ever . - You know ... - Yeah ? I 'm glad you invited me , but is it OK ? This place is expensive . SVC synthetic fish sashimi . For around two months of my drinking money . I guess it 's better for my liver . And I wanted to talk in a place without storage devices . Good evening ! What 's the matter ? It seems Yabe wants to go back home . And I 'm opposed . Yabe , are you really going to leave ? My fever 's down , and time has passed since that stuff . I think it might be OK . It 's not OK . Of those who attacked Yabe , Kawabata 's dead , but there 's still one left . From the info I took off the police server , it 's a guy by the name of Nakamura . Yabe Yuko He may be targeting Yabe . It would be dangerous if you returned now . I know . I know , but ... Um ... Why is Yabe being attacked and stuff ? Makino , you 're casually asking a really difficult question . Sorry . It 's OK . No need to apologise . DC . It 's called " Deformation Character " . Have you heard of it ? Isn 't it those cellular moving pictures from the last century ? " Ani " something or other . Animation . Moving pictures that aren 't real . I love DC . Do you think I 'm strange ? - Why ? - Nothing . It 's not strange at all ! Thanks . And you know what else ? I like still picture DC . I want to be a designer . I 've made quite a few drawings ... - Which ones ? - What ? - Yabe drew this ? - Uh-huh . It 's a net-community in which manga drawings are ... - Deformation Character , right ? - Right . Yabe Yuko 's ID was found on that contribution site . I knew she liked to draw , but I didn 't know she liked participating there . Go back a layer . - Six drawings show up , right ? - Yeah . Those are drawings by the victims . What ? It 's undisclosed information I got from back channels in the department . But all six of the victims were contributors to that site . But there were seven victims . The police don 't consider Kawabata a victim of the murders . What ? From the victims ' information released by the police , it seems the killer prefers girls . Kawabata Ryu was a male . He doesn 't seem to fit the profile , however . Take a look at Number 78 on the list . What 's this picture ? So Kawabata drew this , huh ? He drew it when I met him for real . You met him for real ? The guy who attacked you ? There were some people who admired the drawings I put up on the Net . Kawabata was one of those people . At first he was real nice . He really got into talking about DC . But ... What 's original ? What are you doing ? You 're just copying those designs . I 'm not copying anything . These are all original . The drawings you made are defiling the pictures we 've always admired . - What are you saying ? I never ... - Shut up ! Because of people like you , those wonderful pictures are being debased . So ... Die ! But Kawabata was the one who wound up dead . If you think about it , I suppose Nakamura killed Kawabata , but ... Something 's strange here . What is ? There 's something missing from all six of the victims . Their guts ? Yep . They 're missing some of their guts . It was found on the body this morning . It was taken from the Aikawa girl . Scary ! That 's not normal , removing the guts . Those guys are criminals , it 's dangerous to return to your home . But I really want to change my clothes . And I want to see my mum and dad . Ls your place in A Area ? Yeah . If it 's A Area , then the police are patrolling and it 's not that dangerous , right ? If we 're seen taking her home , there could be trouble . And if we don 't explain about Yabe being here and all about Myao ... I see . I wish I could erase my memories with magic . If you erased your memory , you wouldn 't be able to make it home . That 's right . You wouldn 't be able to call the police , either . - That 's it ! - What ? Magic ! OK . First off , we take Makino home with the usual magic . Because it signals at 24 : 00 hours , Yabe will feign a loss of memory and will go to Makino 's house and make a show of banging on the door . As soon as Makino confirms it 's Yabe , she 'll enter in the security code . Then the guards will come . They 'll take Yabe into custody . Then we 'll just have to rely on the adults and end the mission . From now on , while we 're all united , let 's cut the formal speak . Hazuki , Ayumi , Yuko , and I ... And let 's not leave out Myao . She 's the lonely type . Yeah . That 's why I turned on the transmitter . Where ? - Well , bye . - See you . Later . Me , too . Bye . - Hazuki ? - Yeah ? I don 't think I 'll be able to make it for a while but could you teach me those dance moves ? Me ? - Yube ... - Lt 's Yuko , right ? Hazuki . Yeah ! Hello . This is the DS Guard Centre . Um ... There 's a stranger at my door . We 've confirmed the monitor address . It 's the residence of Ms Makino Hazuki , right ? Yes , sir . We 'll send some guards from your area . Thank you . Just a little longer , Yuko . So , we 'll take in the person you contacted us about from here . I 'll arrange a report to the police . Thank you . Underneath ? Yuko ! Later ! Three days passed . I did as always in the morning . Except for one thing . Everyone promised to meet up again . I really looked forward to hearing from Yuko , who was in the custody of the local guards . I waited with bated breath for three days . I wonder how Yuko 's getting on ... Mail . Maybe it 's ... No way ... Why ? Yuko 's dead . She 's no longer with us . Myao was the killer ? She killed Nakamura and Yuko ? She took out their guts ? What the hell ! Did someone slip up somehow ? I called the local guards . I saw that she was being protected with my own eyes . Where did someone kill Yuko ? Look . I have actual images left on my monitor . This is area guard 602254 . Makino residence , Area 122 . We 've secured the person in question . Centre over . But now this is what the police have . This is area guard 602253 . Makino residence , Area 122 . We 've secured the person in question . Centre over . And the person who was taken into custody wasn 't Yuko , but some other girl I 've never seen before . What the hell is going on here ! Magic ... I think someone must have used it . Someone with magic more powerful than ours . Hazuki , what are you saying ? I 'm the wizard ! I 'm the only one ! It 's our mistake . Yabe and her information were completely wiped out . Even the info here can 't be proven real so it will be treated as fake . The only thing that is real , is that Yabe 's been killed . Get out of here ! Everyone leave ! Mio was pissed . The program that was her pride and joy failed her . No one could have expected it . You 're right . Why are they killing ? There 's no logic to it . People who can kill , kill . There are other killers . Those people have the smell of the beast . The smell of the beast ? You should go home , Makino . I 'm being watched , so I 'll be all right . Ko ... I just sent you a list . Thanks , that 's a big help . Let me check and see if I have the relevant items . Got it . Just don 't go in too deep . You worrying about me ? I worried about your mother , too . I 'll be fine . I 'm different from my mum . I know . Well , I 'll talk to you later . All right , later . It really is worrisome . - Who is it ? - Don 't turn around . Just listen right there . Kono ... it 's dangerous for a child to be out of the house at this time . Tsuzuki and Makino may be killed next . You should report such a dire thing to the police . Information given to the police is being leaked to the perpetrator . Info on the Net is being re-written in favour of the perpetrator . Luckily , the storage devices don 't have a sound retrieval system . Therefore , the criminal whom I know has erased information cannot know that I am here now . What is it that you know ? Before Yabe Yuko was killed , she was taken into custody by the DS Area Guard . I haven 't heard that story from the police . Moreover , if the activity logs were re-written , DS and the Police would soon find out ... DS and the Police ? It 's because Ishida is the great-grandchild of SVC 's founder . I am Ishida Riichiro . Could it really be Ishida ? There 's no time to check . I 'm counting on you to keep an eye on Makino and Tsuzuki . Wait ! Kono ? Safety First Mio ... Get out of there fast . I absolutely will find it . I am the only wizard . It looks like they 're scattered and hidden , but ... What 's this ? Why is that guy ... Wait a sec ! An investigation by the prefectural police into the explosion that occurred in C Area 421-2 is under way . - Mio . - Because the road is blockaded , please follow the navigation instructions . The world 's first SVC synthetic food ... it 's no use . I can 't connect . Not Mio , too . Who is it ? A representative from DS . We received a guard option request from your father . My father ? - Yes . He seemed very worried . - I see . Because we want to provide evidence , we made real contact . Please let us access your monitor inside . - This is it , right ? - Yes . This manages all the locks in the house . - Yes . - This ... The keys ? It 's dangerous so ... We 've reset all the locks in the house . The keys are ... if you don 't lock the doors properly ... This is a specially designed shock gun . It numbs you to the core of your body . You won 't even realise you 're dead . The house keys ... The keys ... Where are they ? Mail ? You ... You really took care of Alvin , huh ? I 'll take care of you just like Yabe . Rei Myao . - Can you move ? - Yes . We 've got to get out of this town . Think you can get in my way , stray cat ? I won 't let you do what you like with me ! Hazuki ! Run ! Rei Myao ? I 'll stop you guys ! Hazuki ! Save yourself , as best you can ! Yuko ... Run , Hazuki ! Sorry for this , at this hour . It 's fine with me . Just , why here ? It would 've been fine at the Centre . Maybe ... it 's a matter I can 't leave any traces of . What 's up ? The students I 'm responsible for , Makino Hazuki and Tsuzuki Mio , I want you to keep an eye on them . Not the police ? Why me directly ? In the Yabe murder case , it appears someone rewrote the police information . That 's harsh news . Who exactly would do such a thing ? - It 's got to be Commissioner Ishida . - That 's bad news . You woke up . Yabe and Tsuzuki were both done in , so I thought maybe you 'd been done in , too . - No injuries ? - Nope . Want something to eat ? There 's only synthetic food . This place is probably in danger , too . Makino , you should leave here quickly . Makino ... I won 't do it . I don 't want to be alone again . Especially , since I met everyone . People I could trust . What would I do all by myself ? Will you come with me ? Where ? SVC . That 's where it all started . Did you throw away your monitor ? We have our lives bound up by the shackles of the monitors as long as we stay in this town . Traffic Restriction 9 : 00 - 17 : 00 I want to ... I want to rest just a bit . How much farther do we have to walk ? It 's 15 kilometres to the SVC Area . Fifteen kilometres . You can go at your own pace . I 'll keep walking . All we can do is run . We 're apart from the system now . If I don 't take victory with my own strength tomorrow , I also won 't be able to feel the warmth of the sun . Let 's live . As much as we can . Where am I ? Kunugi ? Unfortunately , he 's in the middle of something right now . Welcome to the SVC Centre . SVC ? You are Area 122 Community Centre counsellor Fuwa Shizue , I presume . Commissioner Ishida ! Are you the one who killed my kids ? I don 't do those sorts of things . Liar ! Don 't keep looking through the monitor ! Come here at once ! There 's no need . You 're already nearby . What do you mean by that ? Oh , how rude of me . I should treat you as a guest . Well , well ... it looks as if they 're coming all the way here . Makino ! Kono ! Why ? Let 's greet them here . Run ! Kono ! Makino ! Sorry . It 's cos I came in from the front door . We would have been discovered sooner or later . Don 't worry . Makino , run ! This way ! I shouldn 't have . I brought you along . I 'm the one who shouldn 't have . It 's OK , Makino . I 'll draw the robots to me . In the meantime , get out by yourself . What about you ? I 'll be all right . So , don 't give up . Yeah ! Don 't give up ! You ... I 'm alive ! This is for Yuko and Mio . Rei Myao ! She was alive after all . By the skin of my teeth ! I came by myself , I don 't think anything 's changed . I agree . But , I ... I 'm alive . I can feel your warmth , Ayumi . Here I come ! They stopped ? Oh , sorry about that . The guard system is down for maintenance . It seems like the guard robots were on auto-target mode . You guys OK ? Kunugi . The detective seems to have succeeded in protecting the stray children . That was close . Close ? Wasn 't that all your doing ? Funny you should mention it . That 's what she said . She ? The girl who four years ago was forced to commit double-suicide with the suspected serial killer , Fuwa Yukie . Ah yes . Now I remember . Detective Kunugi brought her here , too , just like you . She was trying to learn the truth about the serial murders , just like you are now . Then , Rei Myao is innocent , right ? Leave it to me . Nothing will go wrong . Great . Why did you come here , Detective ? I was asked by Ms Fuwa . You all know the facts of the case . It 's dangerous . Really ? So , that guy Ishida is the real perpetrator , right ? No positive proof , I 'm afraid . So , what you have has to come first . Thank you , really . Leading children , is an adult 's job . Ah , it 's this floor . What 's here ? The truth about the murders . Well , off you go , off you go . Well , you , too . Sorry . The sunset is so beautiful . Detective , what time is it ? Well , let 's see . Ah ... Now , it 's almost ... What was that ? What happened ? He was the enemy . Enemy ? He was a child who never carried a monitor while walking , like we all do . If someone asks me the time , I 'd first ask , " What happened to your monitor ? " But he didn 't . Without even asking , he tried to tell me the time . It 's because he knew from the beginning that we didn 't have our monitors . I guess it 's because ... I 'm a murderer after all . That night , too ... if two people hadn 't run into me , they wouldn 't have died . Don 't tell a soul . You didn 't see a thing . Got it . I 'm sorry about everything . If he hadn 't done anything , I think I would have just gone straight home . In the end , he ran away . I don 't think he ever anticipated a counter-attack . Don 't , don 't you look at me ! After he said that , Kawabata , just as Nakamura had , came toward me with a steel pipe . So it was you who killed him . You could 've just run away ! I don 't know why I did it . But when I realised it , Kawabata was dead . I killed him . Kawabata . And Nakamura as well . I am a loup garou . It 's because I 'm an animal who wears human 's skin . There was a sunflower field where I used to live . As it was my favourite place , I often used to slip out of the house and walk there . There was no one there and I could enjoy the night all to myself . There was a full moon that night , too . I was suddenly attacked by a stranger . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . He kept apologising . He kept talking to me and apologising for killing a girl once , being caught and thrown into an asylum and how sometimes he wanted to attack girls and how he couldn 't get rid of those feelings . And he said that he carried the knife with him as he walked to fulfil desires he could never fulfil and desires that he should never ever fulfil . I took the knife that slashed into my hands and when I saw the nape of his neck ... Myao . Makino will rely on you . - What 's that ? - Here they come ! Hey there ! Still kicking ? - Mio ! - Mio ! Sorry , I kept you waiting . Open up ! Someone open the door ! Ls anybody out there ? You , too , just don 't get it . Detective Kunugi is dead . No one will survive , even if you rush to save them . The children you tried to save , stabbed each other and the unregistered child . The scenario in which Detective Kunugi brings it under control is useless . Countless people have died ! What 's the scenario ? What 's useless ? Are you still human ? Everything in this society is here to achieve the sublime ideals of its founder , Suzuki Keitaro . I don 't know what ideals you 're talking about ! It shouldn 't just be OK for people to die ! - You can 't really believe that , can you ? - What ? Suzuki Keitaro survived the wars of the last century . With this miserable experience as his foundation , he founded SVC . And using sunflowers and plants as raw materials , he succeeded in developing safe and highly reproducible synthetic meats . The result , the solution of the world 's hunger problem . SVC became an essential leader in this nation . What was already at the core of Suzuki 's ideals was that a safely managed society meets those ideals . Healthy children carrying the future are what is necessary . If that 's true , then why do you kill children ! You 're the one who 's depriving the children of their future ! It 's not a waste at all . Not a shred of those children 's bodies is a waste ! They 're useful for the future . Useful ? I brought the raw materials . Ouch ! Where are we ? Those children are ... Alvin . So these are the new materials , huh ? Yes , sir . They are the items you wanted me to retrieve from the Area 122 list . List ? It can 't be ... That list of children ... We greatly appreciate your cooperation , Counsellor Fuwa . There 's nothing to get upset about . You 've fulfilled your duty as an adult in the society you live in . Alvin , the remainder of children on that list are headed toward this floor . Please go and meet them so they can 't get lost . Oh , yeah . I don 't mind if you kill the unregistered child . Affirmative , sir . If there were one person who could ruin my magic , it would only be the person who created the mechanisms of the world . Data was stolen from the building 's construction company . You mean Ayumi ? I knew from a process of elimination . Even though I know the answer , it doesn 't change our current situation . As long as we don 't mess with the worst guy , we 're sitting pretty . He 's nowhere to be found . I can 't make a sound . I can 't make out any shapes . Mio , you went too far ahead . I 'm OK . You can 't scratch this robot even if you hit it with a car ! Mio ! That guy ! Let me go ! This guy ... Let me go ! Hazuki . They 're in here . Rei Myao ! Release Mio ! Rei Myao ! Myao ... Rei Myao ... Mio ... I 've got to save them . I 've got to save the two of them ! I can 't let you get your hands on this . You might damage the precious materials I waited . You have oppressive hands . Ayumi ! I 'm so glad you 're safe . It was good I was alone . I came here alone . I am the only one who killed . I can feel it . Your body warmth . You have the same warm blood flowing through you that we all have . So , let 's all go together . Let 's all end this together . Let 's go ! Mio ! Rei Myao ! - Wow ! What is that ? - Awesome ! It 's dancing . What the heck is that ? Someone is trying to destroy reason in this world . Who ? For all I know , it 's the wolf . Today , I have not spoken to anyone at all In this kind of night the stars really flow it 's almost like the feeling you get riding a roller-coaster While you yawn , the midnight TV Noises blend together Somewhere a message : I am the past I can still touch it It 's so distant Good night old lady Now I 'm going to make a new future From a mysterious star far , far away pure strength rains down On the roundabout path home Like that day of my first kiss pure strength rains down Come closer What the hell is going on ? Answer me , Commissioner Ishida ! You 're trying to take me over . I won 't let you do that ! I am Ishida ... I am ... I am ... I am ... I am ... I am ... it 's me ... I ... Someone ... it 's me ! Tsuzuki ? What did you do ? I threw the SVC Network , in other words , society , into mass chaos . Hacking again ? I don 't do that kind of stuff . Magic tricks again ? I told you , it 's magic . You mean against the law . Ms Fuwa ! You guys are also OK ? Also ? You mean there are other kids in there ? Yeah , they 're inside . What about that guy , Ishida ? Commissioner Ishida ? I spoke to him through the monitor , but ... Through the monitor ? If that 's so , it 's right here , of course . What 's with that place ? This is the centre of the world . In other words , where the bad guy is . What is that ? Commissioner Ishida ? Well , well ... if it isn 't Area 122 Counsellor Fuwa , and her pupils , Tsuzuki Mio , Kono Ayumi and also Makino Hazuki . Right ? You kids don 't remember , do you ? You 're not Ishida ? Ishida ? You mean Riichiro , don 't you ? From the beginning there was no such person called Ishida Riichiro . - He was just a memory . - What ? He was merely a virtual image I created . Once you reach 100 , you can 't very well go out looking like this , can you ? It 's because I made myself dead . So , you 're ... Suzuki Keitaro . I 'm just an epicure , seeking the ideal taste . Long ago , there was a war in the southern islands . In order to survive there , I tasted something I never forgot . Once it has been tabooed , it is cursed forever . And so , just to recreate that flavour , I created SVC from the ground up . Boy , did it grow ! But I only have a memory of that taste . Therefore , I keep requesting it , lest I forget it . I am harnessing all of my legal and financial power , you see . Thank you very much , Ms Fuwa . You 've been a good example for those children . You are extremely curious , but you don 't have a healthy lifestyle . You have the eyes of an anti-social , but you seem to be in very good health . You 're in great shape . I 'll make it you , for tonight 's ingredients . You seem to have good internal organs that were raised in total supervision . You open up an individual as if merely tapping your shoulder . Are you a demon ? I am a loup garou . A beast , that 's all . Are you going to release me from my curse ? No . I 'm only going to kill you . Ms Fuwa , I 'm a bad person . I 've killed people . The only person who can judge me , is you , the adult who knows everything about me . But I ... Please . Please help me . We 're together . I 'm also with you . Because you 're the same as me . We have the same warmth . Two months have passed since then . I went to the police for questioning and was scolded a bit by my father . And , for us , life went back to normal . I don 't detect any problems . That 'll be all for today . We still have some time left over , shall we have a conversation ? No , thank you . I 've got practice next . See you ... Excuse me . Sorry to keep you waiting ! Huh ? What happened ? Myao is pouting . Let 's persuade her together . Why do I have dance with you guys ? For communication ! Communication ! I don 't need that crap ! They said you need it ! Hey ! Let 's go ! - I won 't do it ! - Tan ! In the end , Ayumi was not accused of any crimes . The serial murder events were shrouded in mystery . Suzuki Keitaro was someone who died in the past . He decided not to be there any more . Without reason , Ayumi killed people . It was a reality we couldn 't change . We couldn 't face that reality for an entire lifetime . And now , Ayumi isn 't here any more . But I 'm here . I 'm waiting for him here . I can also see it , the same sky as Ayumi . Hazuki ! Let 's go this way quickly ! Myao looks like she wants to dance ! Who said that and when ? I read your mood . You guys ! Really ! I never told you , of course I like you even now Goodbye , my friend In the sunset Two bicycle silhouettes line up A cool breeze blows like the end of summer vacation Even though I 'll see you tomorrow it 's funny I 'm lonely Instead of the usual Let 's take the long way home I only lacked a little kindness I only lacked a little fun I wonder why ? You were just posing before I had something to tell you before summer vacation ended if I 'm touched one more time , I can 't go back I never told you , of course I like you even now I 'm sorry , my friend The last time we kissed I have memories of your cluttered room The ice is going to melt when we start to eat The times you 've stood next to me are countless We 've become adults just a bit There are things I didn 't even want to know You 're my friend Even now , you 're just my friend The sound of fireworks exploding grandly that drowns everything out is just right No one can hear our love song When we meet eye to eye You call my name Tears flow down I had something to tell you before summer vacation ended if we break-up , I can 't return I never told you , of course I like you even now Goodbye , my friend Long , long ago , there was a beast called a wolf . But wolves became extinct . That 's what happened .

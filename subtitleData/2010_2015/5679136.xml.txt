 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... That 's an artifact from Warehouse 12 . Something about mind control ? I thought there was just one of those . Very good , gentlemen . What is Benedict Valda doing here ? He died in Egypt in a pit of fire . He 's replicating artifacts . 11 . There should be 12 . This portal opens to the regent sanctum in China . We both know it wouldn 't have worked . Why do you say that ? Because you 're in love with Myka . What happened to Claire ? Your sister was infected by the music box . The only solution was Oliver sacks 's record player . It keeps her in a perpetual coma . What happened ? Where 's Claire ? She 's gone . Did I do this ? I tried to cure Claire . Did I somehow make her worse ? If I did , I swear to God ... No ! This is not your fault . But what if it is ? What if I woke something up inside her , something more dangerous than what was already there ? Trust me , we 're gonna find her . But , Claudia , I need you present . I need you focused . Claire needs you . Okay . All right . Well , she couldn 't have woken up by herself , not with sacks 's record player keeping her in a coma , which , by the way , is also gone . Nice security in this place . Well , you might 've noticed that when you broke in . Obviously , somebody hacked into their video surveillance system , probably the same way that you did when you broke in . Well , then , somebody should run a diagnostic of their entire security system , shouldn 't they ? Mm . Without sacks 's record player keeping her in check , Claire would 've trashed this place , right ? Yeah . Whoever did this knew that they had to keep her attached to the record player . But who even knew she was here , much less wanted to break her out ? Well , let 's have a look , shall we ? Good . Spectrometer covers five hours , so Claire was still here . We can ... we can fast forward . Good , I want to see that son of a bitch I 'm gonna put in the ground for this . There . Who 's that ? That 's impossible . - It 's ... - Benedict Valda . Time to rise and shine . Who are you ? What is this thing ? That won 't come off . It allows me to control your prodigious powers , miss Donovan . You 'll do exactly what I say . Like hell I will . Calm down . Calm down . Get up . Come . No . Good . You will do as I say . Yes . You and I are going to do great things , miss Donovan . So Valda is alive . He 's alive . How come Valda didn 't die in Warehouse 2 ? So why wait three years to show up ? This is not the Valda that we knew . If my theory is correct , then this is the Valda ... From the alternate time continuum . Great . The Nazi Valda . Fine . Pete , put it back ! Wow , I never knew it did that . Cool . - Stop touching things ! - Right . Okay . So how did that Valda get into our time continuum ? Versailles forks . I suspect he took one out of my bag while I was his prisoner and he used it to prevent himself from becoming erased . So now that he 's here , what 's he gonna do ? Well , this new Valda , he 's from a militaristic world where ruthless experimentation in the name of scientific progress , that was the norm . And he 's got my sister . I just got her back . I 'm not about to lose her to some psycho from another dimension . When I get my hands on him , I 'm gonna snap off ... Use that energy to figure out why he took her . Fine , but I 'm doing it angrily . Like that . Oh , my God . Guess who 's been hiding out in his room at the dead agent 's vault . Weasel covered his tracks until now . He 's been in the Warehouse the whole time . That 's how he knew about Claire . Pete , come on . Huh ? You and me ? Alone ? Bring your favorite Teddy bear and a nightlight . Come on . Jinksy , you up for a little snoop and poop , huh ? Six eyes are better than four , aren 't they , Artie ? - Artie . Artie . - Uh , whatever ... No , I 'm okay . I 'm just gonna stay here and help these guys out . No , come on . I 'll take off my shirt . Been working on my guns . Yeah ? How about working on your breath ? As if Valda squatting in the Warehouse wasn 't creepy enough , now we got to rummage through his stuff ? Well , clearly he 's been busy in here . Yeah , but doing what ? And what does it have to do with Claire ? Well , maybe these artifacts will tell us . We just have to figure out what they do . Yeah , I 'll grab a laptop so we can check the database . I can do it ! No , it 's okay . I got it . No , no , no ! Really ? Really ? 'Cause I-I don 't mind . Yeah . Thanks , though . So here we are ... Just us . Hi . - What are you doing ? - Huh ? Get back to work ! What ? Yes . All right . Look , I 'm taking inventory of Valda 's personal effects , all right ? You should be ... I don 't know , look through the files or something . Sounds like a date . A plan . It sounds like a plan . Because a date , that would be ... That would mean ... You have got to stop eating sugar . How ... how can you be ... no . Hey , mykes . Yeah ? Valda seems pretty interested in Claire 's freaky psychokinetic powers . The alternate Valda , he got his jollies out of copying artifacts , right ? Right . He replicated the ... The spine of saracen . Exactly . He made a bunch of zombie warriors . Now what if he was gonna do the same thing with Claire ? Right ? What if he was gonna use her to create an army of telekinetic rage monsters to conquer the world ? Probably not . Yeah , but then why does he have all her medical records ? I don 't know , but there 's one item missing from his personal effects . It 's a safe deposit key . So ? To a box in the regent 's vault . What artifact does Valda want from here ? I have no idea . Let 's hope he hasn 't got his hands on it yet . I 'm guessing Keeler not answering his phone is a bad sign . Oh , no . Keeler . But there 's something ... What ? Get out ! It 's a trap ! - Artie . - Artie ? Looks like an Artie-cicle . Okay ... Mykes , we 're gonna have to neutralize this statue . Yeah . Do it . Okay . Oh ! How are we gonna get through the ice ? This inuksuk probably belonged to sir William parry . Gonna need more than that . Well , basically , it means that Artie has been cryogenically frozen . And that means what ? Well , we have about an hour to thaw him out before he freezes to death . Right . There it is . I knew there was some bad news in there somewhere . Okay , so what if we try to internally elevate his body temperature ? Wait a minute , mykes . You remember those ... the glasses that Artie used to warm up the guy that got zombified by the donner party jar ? Yes ! Alfred butz , the inventor of the thermostat ! Let 's call Steve . Let 's call him . Whoo . - Let 's call him out there . - Okay . Okay , I 'll take the glasses to Pete and Myka . Are you okay here on your own ? Of course . I 'm following Artie 's sage advice ... Channeling my anger . I don 't think that 's what he meant , but if it makes you feel better ... Oh , it does , very much so . Go . Save Artie . Artie too . You keep gmng me reasons to kick your ass , mister " v. " Earplugs . Right on time . Please put in those earplugs I gave your driver . Place the needle . Place the needle . 30 minutes . These people will suffer seizures . Then their internal organs will begin to shut down . Ultimately , they 'll die . Imagine the havoc you could wreak upon an air traffic control tower , New York stock exchange , or a military installation . With weapons such as these , you can defeat your enemies completely undetected . This is but one artifact among tens of thousands , artifacts that could and should be engineered as weapons , tools , building blocks for the advancement of your empire . Today they 're locked away , useless . But with forward-thinking people like you and I in charge , we can take these objects and change the course of human destiny . Have I piqued your interest ? Place this Mason 's square in the location that we 've chosen , and we can begin . Come along now , Claire . We have one more important stop to make . - Hey , look at that . - He 's starting to warm up . Now this is that walking stick that causes earthquakes , right ? Sorry , it 's all we could find on such short notice . No , no , no , no , no . I think this could work . I mean , the quake might shake the ice off the statue long enough to bag it . - Do it . - Pete smash . I hated that . Good . He 's grumpy . He 'll be okay . Ugh , what the hell was that ? Oh . Oh , I got a ... I got a ping . It 's a ping . - I 'm gonna ... I got it . - There you go . - Here we go . - This is my ping . No , it 's okay . I got it . Oh , my God . Bunch of people just fell into spontaneous comas at a park in rapid city . So we know what Valda 's doing with sacks 's record player . You know , without pilates 's resistance bands to keep their circulation flowing , all those people could die . No , with that many victims , there wouldn 't even be enough to go around . Okay . You know what , Steve ? Why don 't you stay here and keep an eye on Artie , and , Pete , you come with me ? - Huh ? - Okay . Or ... or ... or you guys could go deal with that and I stay with Artie . - Huh ? - Lattimer ! - Huh ? - Pete . What ? That 's the third time today you 've tried to avoid Myka . What 's up ? I 'm not avoiding Myka . Why would I avoid Myka ? I 'm so not avoiding Myka . You 're lying . You know what , Steve ? That old lying bit got old six minutes after you got here . Mykes , look . Pete , some of them are starting to have seizures . Yeah , the record player must 've gotten to the emts and police as soon as they came within earshot . You got those earplugs ? - Ready ? - Yeah . Ew . The hell ? Why does he have this ? Oh , Valda , you sick freakazoid . Pete ! I 'm just gonna keep them inside the truck . Okay , I 'll stop the record player . Okay ! Wait ! Secret service . Stay inside . Don 't get out . Fudge . Pete ! - Pete ? - Mommy ? Hey ! I would 've called , but I figured ... Yeah , what the hell just happened ? Mommy ... " Chuck Yeager 's favorite lp . " He 's the guy who broke the sound barrier . Oh , my God ! Valda switched the records ! Hey ! Hey , it 's the iron shadow 's underwear ! Charles atlas 's workout trunks . This looks like a job for ... Dizzy , sleepy . All right , put me in , coach ! No , no ! I got this . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . Oh , right . You 've been there , done that . Myka . Myka ! Mykes ! Are you okay ? Thanks , partner . - Uh ... - Ow ! Sorry . - What are you listening for ? - Shh , shh ! Vibrations . Every artifact resonates with a unique frequency . If I come upon a silent box ... No ! No , no , no . Empty ! Whatwhat did Valda take ? It 's not what he took . It 's what he 's gonna do with it . Benedict Valda is gonna steal the Warehouse . What do you mean Valda 's gonna steal the Warehouse ? How ? With , among other things , the setting maul of hiram abiff . The getty mall at high cliff ? What ? Setting maul . It 's kind of like a Mason 's hammer . Hiram abiff . He was an architect who , according to the freemasons , built Solomon 's first temple . And his hammer is integral to the relocation of the Warehouse from one host country to the next . So how do we stop Valda if he has everything he needs to steal it ? He does not have everything . The setting maul is only one of three artifacts that precipitate the moving of the Warehouse . The others are the Mason 's square and the compass . He 's already stolen the square . So he 's probably already chosen the location of the new Warehouse . Now , the placement of the square tells the compass where to transport the artifacts . How does the compass work ? Once the setting maul has been reassembled , it activates the compass and the compass sweeps the Warehouse . It converts all the artifacts ' energy , directs all that energy to the new Warehouse . And that 's what completes the transfer . Say what ? It 's like the transporter from star trek minus the dilithium crystals . Oh . Cool . Now for safety , the maul is separated into two parts , the handle and the hammer . Now the handle is what was taken from the regent vault . The hammer is located at the birthplace of the host country . See ? I 'm not just a pretty face . So yes . Now when it 's time for the Warehouse to move , then the two pieces of the maul are reunited ... And the compass is triggered , which begins to phase out the artifacts . To complete the transfer , the setting maul has to be struck against the cornerstone of the new Warehouse , phasing in the artifacts at that location . And we have to stop Valda from doing that . So Valda already has the handle part , so we just need to get to the hammer before he does . Well , I get that . Let 's just do that . - Yeah . - Where is it buried ? The hammer is hidden at the green dragon tavern in Boston . Of course . That 's where the Boston tea party was conceived and the American revolution was born . You three , get to Boston right now . Steve and I are gonna lock down the compass to keep it from being activated . Go ! Why do they call it the " aisle of the widow 's son " ? Originally , it 's a freemason ... Don 't you have access to Wikipedia ? Look it up . Look out for the rat . Ooh ! All right . We keep the compass in here , in the widow 's son 's aisle , because this is one of the most secure and safe areas in all of the Warehouse . - So when you say " safe " ... - Don 't start with me ! Valda . He must 've already moved it in position . So let 's go get it . Well , why didn 't I think of that ? The only thing is , I don 't know where the position is , do you ? As you may have noticed , this Warehouse is rather large ! No Valda . No Claire . So how the hell did we beat him here ? Well , this bar was built over the original green dragon tavern , which was demolished in 1854 . So I 'm guessing Valda might be at the new one . Good thing he doesn 't have a Myka . Yeah , but why steal the Warehouse ? Why not just take it over ? Maybe he wanted to recreate it , make it more like the version he knew under paracelsus . That 's a sobering thought . You know what I still don 't get ? The record player thing . I mean , was it supposed to be some sort of distraction ? - Yeah , or a demonstration . - Hmm . Oh , snap . It 's an open house for the new owners . Guys , over here . She 's a regent . - He 's been here . - Or he 's still here . What we need is behind that wall . What the hell was that ? Sounds like it 's coming from below us . Claire . Claudia , wait ! Myka . Mykes , hold on ! Okay ? We don 't know if it 's ... safe . Please . I know you don 't want to hurt me . Told you . Telekinetic rage monster . Pete , wait , if Claire loses consciousness then that thing could crush Claudia . So how do we stop her ? The lens ! The lens is how he 's controlling her . Put down your weapons ... Or Claire will crush her like a grape . Come on , Claire . Fight him . Fight back ! She 's still in there . I know you can hear me . You really think we 're gonna let you steal the Warehouse ? You really think you have a choice ? Bury them . No ! Artie , what is happening ? It 's Valda . He 's reassembled the setting maul and activated the compass . The Warehouse is beginning to move . I know ! Can you tell where Valda put it ? It 's got to be somewhere under the Warehouse . There 's an " under the Warehouse " ? Stay ! Not you , Steve . Just put your back into it , Lattimer . If I put my back any more into it , my kidneys are gonna explode . Okay , this is never gonna work . We just ... we 're just gonna have to find another way out . What if that is the only way ... Oh . Claude ? The second Valda trapped us down here , I started feeling ... Something different , something bad .. Worse than the Warehouse moving ? Yes , something else , something about my connection to the Warehouse . Okay , look . This was once a safe house where Paul revere and the sons of liberty plotted against the British , right ? - Right . - So ... So if the redcoats raided this place during a secret meeting ... - They 'd need an escape route . - Yes . All righty . All right , so Paul revere , right ? One if by land ... Two if by sea ... Three if by secret passageway . Zoinks ! Velma , Daphne , let 's go ! Are you sure the neutralizer will stop it ? I stopped being sure of things in 1983 . But if we don 't do something , then everything in the Warehouse will disappear within a day . So no pressure . You do have a plan " b , " right ? Silly string ? That 's what 's gonna save the Warehouse ? I once saw this particular silly string lock up the entire gooery . Start spraying . - We did it . - Yes ! Yes ... ? What ? I hate spiders . Okay , listen . We really need to find out where Valda went . Well , one good thing about Boston is there 's cameras everywhere . So he should turn up on at least one of the ... ah , I got you . Diplomatic plates . Okay , according to the U.N. Database , license plates with the letters c-y belong to the Chinese consulate . Outsourcing , huh ? This guy gets more evil by the minute . We really need to loop in Artie . The limo tracks to a private airfield outside of Boston , where a delegation of Chinese diplomats just departed for Beijing . So he is taking the Warehouse to China . Man , I don 't want to work in China . It 's probably impossible to find a good burrito . I would imagine that China 's the only country with the financial power and technical wherewithal to create the kind of Warehouse that Valda has in mind . All right , well , let 's get to Beijing and stop him . Well , how ? Valda 's already wheels-up . Yeah , but we 've got a portal . I 'm not ready for the Warehouse to move . This can 't be the end . This isn 't the end . We won 't let it be . Hey ! Good . We 're almost ready . Artie , I think Claire has more to do with this than we think . I 'm afraid Valda has plans for her . What makes you think that ? Well , if getting the hammer was all he needed her for , he would 've killed her by now , but he hasn 't . I-I-feel he needs her for something more important . I think I know what it is . What ? That 's a bad tone . What ? The Warehouse will recognize a caretaker . First caretaker of Warehouse 13 was killed in the fire of 1898 . After that , her sister took over . - Mrs. Frederic ? - Had a sister ? So what , the Mrs. Frederic of the east ? And that 's why Valda was going through the Donovan family medical records . And that explains the bad juju I 've been feeling . Valda is going to make Claire caretaker of his new Warehouse . A very powerful one that he has control over . I wonder if a mini tesla grenade will fit in Valda 's mouth . Claudia . Be careful . He is gonna continue to use Claire against you , and he has total control of her . Not total . I saw her fight him in Boston . She 's still in there . I can reach her . Don 't let your feelings for her be your blind spot . Valda 's hooks may already be in her too deep . I saw it too , Artie . She 's not his , not yet . Just got to find a way in . Yeah . Well ... Find it fast . All right , listen up . If my contact in China is right , then Valda is heading for the Beijing national olympic stadium . That 's his location ? If he finds the cornerstone and strikes it with the setting maul , the new Warehouse will be consecrated , the artifacts will start to phase into their new home , and Warehouse 13 will officially come to an end . Okay . All right . Let 's go to China and stop Valda from ordering takeout . Well , looks like the silly string 's a bust . Tell me that you have a plan " c . " We have no choice . We 're gonna have to destroy the compass . What happens if we destroy it ? Happily accepting guesses on that . The stadium 's too small . Where 's he gonna put everything ? According to these schematics , there are dozens of underground levels , each of them several acres wide . It 's also where we 'll find the cornerstone . Guys . That says " Warehouse 14 . " Whoa . Everything 's still in flux . Valda hasn 't completed the transfer yet . I told you . Portal trumps private jet every time . Now we need to set a trap for that psycho son of a ... Welcome to Cangku Shisi . Warehouse 14 . My Warehouse . Thank you for providing the means to come to this reality . You 've given me something in this world I could never have had in mine ... Complete control . Kill them slowly . I want them to see it all arrive before they die . These buttons are from the lab coat worn by the chemist Julius Wilbrand when he discovered trinitrotoluene ... Tnt . As the laymen say , yes . When they 're put in close proximity to each other ... Boom . Artie , if we destroy the compass , what happens when it 's actually time to move the Warehouse ? Oh , let them use fedex . You ready ? Fire in the hole ! Artie , tell me that you have a plan " d . " No ! There 's no plan " d . " Valda , you son of a bitch ! This is my home ! And I will never , never let you take it away , you hear me ? Never ! Never ! Is this rope an artifact ? What 's the provenance ? No ! It 's just a rope ! Stop asking questions and help me ! Guys , we got to get down from here before Valda finds that cornerstone . Claude , just try ... Try and reach Claire . Claire ... Claire , listen to me . Valda can 't control you , you hear me ? He can 't . You 're way too strong . Fight him ! It 's just making her angrier . What am I supposed to say ? Connect with her , Claude . Find something that you ... You both love . Claire ... Try to hear me , please . ♪ Blood and blisters ♪ on my fingers ♪ chaos ... You guys , this isn 't gonna work . Claudia , don 't stop . Just keep going . Claudia , please ! ♪ Chaos rules when we 're apart ♪ ♪ watch my temper ♪ I 'll go mental ♪ watch my temper ♪ I 'll go mental ♪ I 'll try to be gentle ♪ when I grow up ♪ I 'll be stable ♪ when I grow up ♪ I 'll turn the tables Fine . I 'll be caretaker myself . Claire ? Claire ! Oh , I 've always loved the sound of your voice . Oh ! Claude ... okay , good . Myka and I are gonna try and stop Valda from consecrating Warehouse 14 . Meanwhile , try and get that thing off her eye . I tried , but it won 't come off . Okay , wait , guys . If this lens gave Valda access to Claire 's mind , wouldn 't reversing it give her access to his so we could transfer her artifact energy into ... Claudia , no . I know what you 're thinking , but no . Wouldn 't transferring Claire 's telekinetic rage into Valda just make him more powerful ? Yeah , you 're right . I 'm sorry . No , no . No , you know what ? Do it . I have an idea . I think we can kill two birds with one stone . Mykes , come with me . Okay . Wish us luck . This might hurt . The cornerstone . So easy to change the world . Aah ! Concentrate . Focus on Valda . Send him the power . Hey , Valda ! This doesn 't belong to you . I 'll take that . Say good-bye to your Warehouse . Hey , Benny . Check your pockets . Fork you . Oh , my ... - Yeah ? - Yeah . Okay , now get angry about something . - I 'm fine . - Yes ! They did it ! Yes , you guys ! - Oh , my God ! - Yes ! Whoo ! How many times do we have to save the world ? We should get a raise . Artie , we did it ! You and me saved the Warehouse ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . You think maybe they did something in China ? Nah . So are you sure I 'm really cured ? 100 % . Yeah , the music box energy required a human host . And as soon as you sent that energy into Valda and he got erased from this timeline ... So did the energy . Simple physics , really , with a freaky Warehouse twist . Yay , Pete ! Okay . One more thing . - What ? No ... Yes . Oh , my ... This belongs to you now . No , no , no . I told you . My strongest memories are of you and this guitar . So now that you 're back for good , let 's make some new ones . Besides , I 've already got my eye on this sweet '57 les Paul goldtop in featherhead . Of course you do . And I already booked us into the unmlle coffee house in eight weeks . Sounds like you found your calling as a Warehouse agent . Yeah . I mean , at least until the whole caretaker destiny thing kicks in . Yeah , I was destined to be in a coma for the rest of my life , and somebody changed all that . Yeah . See , jinksy , it 's all about isolating ... Hey , guys , I got to go help Artie . I 'll be right back . Oh , um , hey . You were great in China . Pete ... Okay , Mr. human lie detector . You look me in the eye and tell me I 'm lying . I am in love with Myka Bering . Damn it . I know . I just ... I can 't believe that the Warehouse almost moved . We 've been here for five years , you know ? It feels ... feels like home . Try 40 years . A little piece of advice . Take it one snag at a time . Something I 've learned on this job is you never know when things are gonna ... Change . Artie , I thought we stopped it . We did . There 's a problem , isn 't there ? Yes . We retrieved the setting maul . We stopped the Warehouse from moving . Why is that compass still active ? I had a feeling ... Yes , I 'm afraid Benedict Valda 's actions may have set certain events into motion . Events ? What kind of events ? The kind that even I may be unable to stop .

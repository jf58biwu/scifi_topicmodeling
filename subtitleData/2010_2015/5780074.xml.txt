 Barbie : Two weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , We still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , Bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Why are you looking for sam ? I think he 's known who melanie is all along . Wondered when you 'd show up . Aren 't you afraid of people seeing us Together ? You made a promise , 25 years ago , to make sure That what we buried stayed buried . You 've come to set me free . My mother said you had answers . I want them . ( grunts ) lyle : I 'm out for good , now . Looks like angle got a piece of whoever did this to her . Do you think this is where lyle disappeared to ? It 's a tunnel . You tried to kill us all . Julia , I didn 't do it . What big jim and rebecca Tried to do is inexcusable . But it 's not unforgivable . I think she 's done a hell of a job running chester 's mill . ( grunts ) Rebecca : What do you see ? Basement . Didn 't know it was even under the school . Any sign of lyle ? There 's footprints . They 're heading up into this tunnel . Be careful . Barbie 's sheriff now , maybe ... Lyle killed angle . I tracked him down here . I 'm doing this . Not alone . Rebecca : Please come back . Lyle 's dangerous . Not for long . Hey . I need to borrow your prius . You going looking for lyle ? Yeah . Well , as long as he 's out there On the loose , he 's my problem . I 'm not gonna sleep tonight unless I do a few more sweeps . Being sheriff already looks good on you . Also , if you talk to sam , Get ahold of me on the walkie , 'cause I want to question him , too . About melanie ? Melanie , angie , What he 's been doing all day . I 'm not pointing any fingers . I 'm just trying to explore all the options . Be careful . I thought you were with joe and norrie . They went home . They 're mad at me . I did something stupid . You want to tell me what ? I kissed joe . I know . I just wanted to feel normal for a minute . Melanie , you are normal . I died . Nothing about me is normal . Why am I even here ? Because I 'm connected to some egg ? And no one even knows where it is . Actually , I do . I dropped it in the lake A few minutes before I found you . Why 'd you do that ? Because the dome wanted me to . It chose me . And I think it brought you back for a reason . What reason ? I don 't know . Joe : It was only one kiss ! I 'm sorry ! But it 's not just that you kissed her ! Ever since melanie got here , everything 's been about her ! It 's like there 's no us anymore . But there is ! I love you , norrie . Too bad . I don 't love you . What are you doing ? Why should I stay here then ? Big jim 's not my family . Or carolyn . If you don 't love me , Then why would you want me around here , right ? Right . ( door slams ) It 's a good feeling , isn 't it ? Doing right by the town . I love that feeling . You 've had it so rarely . Yeah , well , you 'll disappoint them soon enough . You trying to rattle me , jim ? Just don 't want you to feel too good about yourself . You and I both know whose town this is . It 's not yours . It 's not mine . And the first thing I 'm gonna do Is give it back to them . " give it back to them " ? These people are entitled to a say in what happens to them . That 's interesting . You 're gonna put a town on the brink In the hands of scared , desperate people ? Is there a brain under that hair ? These people don 't need to talk About their feelings . They need to be led . I did you and rebecca a favor by convincing " these people " Not to string you two up . Don 't test my patience . The only reason this town didn 't riot Is ' cause I took your hand . Half this town is mine . Don 't you forget that . Hey , you hear what your girlfriend 's doing ? She 's putting every major town decision to a vote . Let us twiddle our thumbs while rome burns . Last I heard , voting was a right . Yeah , well , tell her it 's a bad idea . She won 't listen to me . That 's a wise woman . Look , barbie . You and I have been on the same side when it counts . Hey , jim , who told julia that I was in On this whole extermination plan ? See , every time I 've given you The benefit of the doubt , It bites me in the ass . Now , I 'm not gonna cross julia . And if you try to , I 'm not gonna be as forgiving as she is . Rebecca ( over radio ) : Barbie , you there ? Barbie ? Yeah , go ahead , rebecca . I 'm at the high school . Sam and junior are tracking lyle . You 'd better get here . On my way . Lyle had to bust out the back of the locker to get down here . We must be a half a mile in by now . You want to go back , go back . I don 't need your help shooting him . Look , junior , I know you loved angle , But killing someone is no small thing . You 've done that ? Of course not . Clint dundee put his hands all over angie . I hunted him down and shot him in the heart . I appreciate you looking after me , but lyle 's dying today . ( footfalls approaching ) A little jumpy . Now , you want to stop Pointing that thing at me , junior ? Sam . Been awhile . People looking for you . Yeah , I 've been busy . I 'm not gonna let junior hunt for a lunatic by himself . I 'm moving on . You go on ahead . I 'm just gonna hang back . You know , make sure no one else sneaks up on us . My mom 's journal . Junior , stop ! ( explosion ) Barbie ! Watch out ! ( coughing ) Barbie : Sam , you okay ? Sam : Oh ! Bashed up , but all right . Junior ! Stay there ! I 'll get some help ! God ... Your head 's bleeding . It could 've been worse . Thanks for the push . Yeah . I think lyle did this . The town barber makes bombs ? He 's always been a crafty guy . And he 's gone crazier than a rat in a jar Since the dome came down . He 's smart enough to bait the trap With the journal . Well , we 're not getting out the way we came . Guess we 'll try that way . After you . Just-just stay still , okay ? There you go . You thought it was a good idea To go down there with that drunk ? He 's done more for me than you ever did . What are you even doing here ? Nobody called you . I don 't need your permission To go here or anywhere else . Jim , give it a rest , okay ? I 'm trying to bandage your son . What happened ? I heard you radio barbie . Where is he ? Sam and I were tracking down lyle . Barbie came after us , and then all of a sudden , I tripped on something and then there was a cave-in . You went through this locker ? Where are they ? Are they all right ? ! There 's a bunch of rocks and stuff blocking them in . We have to get them out of there . We 've got bigger problems than those two . ( wind whistling ) The acidity in the red rain must have fried the topsoil . Yeah , well , it 's blowing around everywhere And coating everything , Including the inside of the dome . Which is semi-permeable . If the dome walls get clogged , No air 's gonna be able to get in . And then we suffocate . All of us . How long until that happens ? There are steps we can take , okay ? Mist dispersal . Get water into the air As quickly as possible to ground the dust . Fire hose , fan , uh , a giant windmill , maybe . I had the kids working on some , But I had to put it on the back burner . We still have all the materials , though . Big jim : At least your idea Is doing more than julia 's to help . You just want to see barbie and sam dead . So , I guess it 's up to me , then , huh ? You know , they could be in part of the old cement factory . We find a map of the tunnel system , We might find another way in . Can you find one ? Junior : Lyle might have already gotten out . There 's no way of knowing If he 's down there anymore . Better he 's out here Than hunting barbie and sam down there . Yeah , but if he 's back up here , he 's just as dangerous . Sam and I found out that lyle wasn 't just after angle . He 's after the four hands . How does he know about the hands ? My mom drew a picture of us Holding up the dome way back when . Now , lyle thinks that if we 're dead , the rapture comes . So , he wanted to kill you , too ? Yeah . He knew I 'd follow him . I 'm pretty sure That bomb down there was meant for me . We need to make sure joe and norrie are safe . I 'll do that . Be careful . I 'll go with him . Melanie , I don 't ... They 're my friends , too . I 'm going . I 'll make sure she 's safe , I promise . Barbie : So , you known lyle all your life , right ? Sam : Yeah , we were friends growing up . You hear or seen anything recently Makes you think he may have killed angle ? I haven 't seen him in years . But between kidnapping rebecca , Clocking junior and all that- - makes sense . So , then , why 'd you guys stop being friends ? Something happen ? Nope . Sometimes people just grow apart . You got a preference ? You go left , I got right , We cover more ground ? You tired of me already ? I 'm tired of you eyeing me for no reason , yeah . Junior : You 're awfully quiet . Melanie : I 'm scared . Aren 't you ? It 's okay . You heard what I told julia . I promise I 'd keep you safe . You look so much like sam when he was younger . Melanie , what the hell is going on with you ? I have to tell you something ... Crazy . I think ... Lyle 's who killed me . Come on , come on ! Get inside . Come on , everyone , get inside ! The dome 's walls are already plugging up . No air 's gonna be able to get through . And if we don 't act now , we 're all gonna choke to death . The air is too hot and dry . But I know that if we work together , We can make this plan happen . We can make a windmill Like rebecca pine 's class was building . And we can use it to fan water through the air and that 'll ... And what 's in the water , jim ? Another virus ? Do you think I made that decision lightly ? I put my own life at risk . My son 's life at risk . I 'm just trying like hell to get us through this thing somehow . What 's julia say about this windmill ? Well , I don 't know 'cause julia 's not here . I am . But I guess I 'm not supposed to give orders anymore . That 's apparently not my place . So , let 's do it democratically . All those in favor of the mist dispersal system , Doing something instead of nothing , Raise your hand . Grinnell : Everyone in favor of jim Shutting up while we wait the storm out ? Great . Where you going ? Neither wind nor rain Nor creepy-ass dust . ( door closes ) Joe ! Norrie ! Joe ? Pauline did that . Didn 't she ? Yeah . It 's so strange to think you were alive All those years ago . And that you knew my mom when she was a girl . She was the first friend I made When I moved here . What was she like ? Cheerful . Really brave . I 'm sorry she died so unhappy . I should 've been here . For her . It 's not like you could help it . Can you keep a secret ? Yes . Norrie : Do you hit on literally everyone ? I wasn 't ... Don 't answer . It was rhetorical . Norrie , why are you crying ? Where 's joe ? Gone . Gone where ? I don 't know ! Are you happy ? Norrie , lyle 's on the loose and he 's coming After the four hands . We have to find joe before he does . And we 're just standing here ? ! Hey ! Sorry , I thought you were lyle . Oh , yeah ? I thought we were trying to cover more ground . We are . But then you double back and you follow me ? What are you talking about ? I went right . How did you get in front of me ? I-I-I went left . Let 's keep going . Maybe you can put my mind at ease about something . What 's up ? Where were you the night that angle mcalister died ? Are you kidding me ? Hey , just answer my question . I was looking for melanie . See , that 's funny . Because I haven 't seen you all day , When we just found out that her name was melanie Yesterday . Junior told me . No , he didn 't . You knew her 25 years ago . And you 've known who she is since julia rescued her From the lake , only you didn 't say a word to anyone . Why didn 't you say anything , sam ? About melanie being back from the dead ? You tell me how to start that conversation . All right , you know what ? Would you just answer the question that you keep dodging ? Where ... ? ( both grunting ) ( both grunt ) ( both grunting ) You gonna say thank you ? That lyle 's ? Has to be . You think he went out this way ? I think you go out that way , You go out forever . ( wind blowing ) Norrie : Joe , are you in here ? ! Oh , thank god ! You idiot ! Melanie : We were worried about you . We looked all over . I can take care of myself . Junior : Not with lyle wanting to kill us . He wants the four hands dead . That 's why he killed angle . That 's the reason ? Maybe I should thank him then . What ? Angie 's out now . Maybe that 's the only way any of us are gonna get out . Melanie : It didn 't work for me . I died . I came back . Will she ? It took awhile for me . I think the dome choose all of us for something . And now we have to deal with it . We need to figure it out Together . I 'm sorry , melanie . I think we need to stay put . Angie would want me to keep you all safe . No . Angie would 've wanted answers . She wouldn 't have stopped till she got them . Melanie : Junior , we have to do this . I would rather risk Dying again than not knowing why I 'm here any longer . ( sighs ) Do you have any idea where to start ? The lake . We start there . You think lyle jumped ? Well , he sure as hell didn 't climb down . Hey , you know what ? Maybe he went right back there . Got out that way . I told you , I went right- - It brought me back to you . I didn 't hear it hit anything . This thing must be deep as hell . Something 's off here . Understatement . I mean , given how far we just walked , We should 've hit the dome wall by now . Maybe the dome doesn 't come down this far ? Except that everything we know about it says that it does . You 're sure you went right back there ? Hey , you know what , man ? I 'm sick of you calling me a liar . Who the hell knows your story anyway ? No one knows where you came from and you don 't say . Well , shouldn 't you be telling me what 's going on ? 'cause you 've known about the egg since 1988 When you and melanie , lyle , pauline , When you all found it ? You know more than you 're saying . Well , that makes two of us . Did you find the cement factory maps ? Just grabbed everything and brought them . ( coughs ) This is almost as bad as outside . Honestly , julia , The storm is more my area . Oh , yes , all science is your area . I 'm a teacher in chester 's mill . I 'm not an engineer for lockheed . I am all too aware of my limits . And I know what kind of damage you 're capable of . You don 't trust me ? I forgave you . That 's not the same thing . Here we go . Except this says the cement factory never extended Under the school . Nowhere even in the vicinity . So , who the hell went into the school basement And dug a tunnel ? All that matters right now is there 's no other way down there . And no way to rescue barbie and sam that we know of . Unless we blast the blockage . And if they 're pinned by debris ? They get blasted , too ? Junior said he yelled at them . We can tell them not to stand next to the thing We 're gonna blow up . You got a better idea ? ( hacking ) ( gasping , coughing ) Ben ! Sit down ! Benny ! What is it , hon ? ( gasping for air ) he can 't breathe ! Oh , here ! Water . Water 's not gonna help him . He needs his inhaler . Oh , it 's okay , honey . It 's okay . There you go . Here . There you go . Grinnell : There you go . Outside 's not getting any better , folks . Pretty soon , none of us are gonna be able to breathe . Anybody want to put it to another vote ? I 'm down . Sam : This is about julia , isn 't it ? All this suspicious crap . If it makes you feel any better , nothing happened . Yeah , you 're right about one thing . I can 't stand you hanging around julia 'cause I think you 're shady as hell . But right now , we 're both stuck on some cliff , So how about you shut up and let me think about that ? How the hell could we be past the dome wall ? How can I go left and you go right , Somehow we both end up in the same place ? It 's like something wanted us to end up here . Is this how it 's finally gonna do me in , By driving me out of my mind ? The only thing this damn dome 's ever done is bring pain ! I thought I was crazy when I first Saw melanie back at the lake . I just kept thinking there 's no way It could be the same girl . Except it is . What happened the night that she died , sam ? None of your business . Well , you can tell me here or you can tell me in jail After I 've hauled you out of here by your throat . Only reason I can think of as to why you 'd hide it ... You killed melanie . Don 't tell me what I did ! Well , then , you tell me what you did ! You want to know ? The night we found the meteorite , None of us could believe it . And then we found the egg inside . Melanie said everybody was scared of it except her . I just wanted to leave it the hell alone ! But melanie decided That it needed to be protected . That it was alive somehow . And scared . How did she end up dead ? ( sighs ) The egg started screaming . Pauline grabbed her head And said , " it 's killing me . " Lyle flipped . Said , " we got to help pauline ! " I tried to get the egg , But melanie wouldn 't let it go . Lyle went after her . I let him . He pushed her , And she fell into the crater . Her head hit the meteorite . We panicked . Pauline begged me to help lyle . I did . I left the love of my life in a hole , Like garbage . And now she 's back . All right , let 's hoist it on three- - one , Two , three ! Come on ! Barbie ? Can you hear me ? Sam ? Maybe they kept going . How many different ways do you know to kill someone ? It 's how I apply it that counts . Whoa ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Can you not blow us up before we save them ? Yeah , I 'm trying . What are you doing teaching high school ? You mean how 'd I screw up my life ? That 's not what I meant . I was headed to cornell Before I came to chester 's mill . Why the change ? My dad got sick . I had to take care of him before he died . Can 't be all that different from your story . You were a journalist , right ? Mm-hmm . Was chester 's mill your dream job ? No , it wasn 't . See ? Neither of us wanted to be here . But we are . We made choices and we ended up here . Maybe I could 've helped a lot more people If I hadn 't helped my dad . But that wasn 't gonna happen . So , you and me are stuck doing this . Why 'd you work with jim ? Because I thought his heart was in the right place . I was wrong about that . I don 't think I 'm wrong about you . Careful . The dust cleared out . Yeah . So , what now ? It 's been hours . The egg knows we 're here . I can feel it . It 's like it 's waiting . All I know , this egg isn 't showing itself . Even with all of us here . Maybe we have to do something together . Like what ? Like when angle was here , And we all touched the mini-dome ? Melanie was one of the original four hands . Maybe she still counts . So angle 's replaceable ? ! No one 's replacing your sister . But norrie 's right . I don 't hear any other ideas . ( quiet laugh ) It 's working ! So , why 's melanie back now ? To haunt me ? To bring everyone more pain ? It 's not all pain under this thing . The hell it 's not . Every day is a new nightmare . Dome 's a slow execution for everyone in here . You of all people should know that . Yeah , but I deal with it . You look for what makes ... What makes going on worth it . Take julia . Being with her , That 's ... It 's a chance for me to be good . The dome scares me , too , but It 's not all pain . Sometimes I see melanie 's face in the dark ... With the blood starting to pour out . If I could change one thing in my life , That 'd be it . Yeah , I know how you feel . Oh , yeah ? Who 'd you kill ? A lot of people . Given the way things are going I know it 's gonna happen again . I mean , I don 't want that , but ... Sometimes you see their faces You wonder ... Are they gonna be waiting for you on the other side ? Yeah . The other day , I found her waiting for me on this side . What the hell can I say to her ? We get out of here , Maybe you can give it a try . I know melanie just wants answers more than anything . As far as what happened between you two 25 years ago , you know , that 's between you and her . Thank you . Thanks for not letting me fall . Hey , those aren 't from rocks . Hey ! Where 'd you get those scratches , sam ? Put that there . And this one will fit Right here . And I connect the fuse . Thank god for the department of roads and repair . You praying ? No . But I hope to god this works . Barbie ! Sam ! If you can hear me , Get way , way back ! Okay . Let 's do this . Back to the entrance , right . Okay . Those are defensive wounds . From fingernails . You 're kidding , right ? Angie was a fighter . She got a piece Of whoever tried to kill her . The skin under her fingernails Showed that . Barbie ... You killed her , sam . Not lyle . You . And everything that you 've done Has been to put the blame back on to him . The guy 's a maniac ! You saw what he did to rebecca ! And he attacked my nephew ! You killed a 19-year-old girl that your nephew loved ! I had to ! Everything pauline put in her journal Has come true . It says in here that if those Four kids die , the dome comes down ! It 's a sacrifice I have to make to save everyone ! You would even kill junior ? At some point I 'll have to ! I 'll finish it , and I 'll finally be free ! Then I will kill myself . Or you can kill me . Hell , I 'll thank you for it . You will never see my face in the dark . I swear . You 're not even gonna touch those kids . I 'm taking you in . And your justice is gonna be Whatever junior does to you once he finds out . ( quietly ) : She 's not so bad . Now you believe her ? Yes . I 'm sorry . For what ? For not giving you a break Like you gave me after my mom died . I 'm sorry I ever made you feel like I didn 't love you . I love you , too . ( door opens nearby ) ( door closes ) Okay , everything 's locked up . Do you think lyle 's following us ? I don 't know . I 'm just being careful . You guys ready ? Yeah . Yeah . Let 's find out . Pink stars . Like we saw before . I saw that in my dream . I 've seen it , too . Years ago . It 's in my hometown . Zenith . Yeah , but what does it mean ? It 's just a reasonable explosion . They 're smart guys , right ? They 'll know to put some space Between them and the blockage . They won 't be hurt . You ready ? I trust you . ( explosion ) Hey . What are you doing ? You 'll never let me finish what I have to , so it 's on you now . I don 't care if you live or die . But if you got any sense of right and wrong left , You 're gonna look junior in the face and tell him what you did . Take it . When the time comes , you 'll need it . You owe junior the truth ! You 'll see . It 's all pain . When you watch enough people die , When you watch julia die , You will put the knife to those kids yourself ! I 'm so tired , barbie . Sam . Sam ! Rebecca : No sign of barbie or sam . They 've got to be in here somewhere . Julia ! Did a good thing today , jim . Well , honestly , it 's a relief just to lend a hand . I think we all have something To be proud of today , right ? The real question is Where 's julia been all day ? Well , I heard that barbie got into some kind of trouble Over at the high school . She decided to help him instead of pitching in with us . Well , you don 't say ? I guess , sometimes love Wins out over doing your job . Barbie ! Thank god ! Oh , you 're okay . Yeah . Where 's sam ? He 's gone . Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

 Whoa ! Would you look at that . It 's amazing . I 've never seen anything like it Mr. President . Me neither . Here we go Mr. President . Mr. President . Sophie is ready for you haircut sir . Well you can tell her unless she 's planning for my assassination , it 's not a good time right now . Why don 't we wait till we 're on the ground . We can always get that together before the photo ops . Yeah yeah yeah . I 'll let her know Mr. President . Besides , I kinda like a little long . Reminds me of my blue collar days . Geez . Mr. Green . - Yeah . Can you ask the pilots if they can take us above this please ? I 'll go speak with the crew . Are you ok sir ? Yeah , uh ... I got a little headache . I have some ibuprofen sir . Good idea . Green , what 's going on up there ? Get the pilots to level the plane . I think it 's about time we get up front and get strapped in Mr. President . Thank you . We are flying over the Bermuda Triangle after all . We need to evacuate now Mr. President ! Get him out of here ! Let 's get him out ! Hold on to him ! Alright ! Go ! Clear ! Alright go ahead ! Mr. President . The pod is equipped with atmospheric and pressurization controls , As well as oxygen recyclers . So you have plenty of air to breathe . The maximum crush depth is 20,000 feet . You 'll have enough food and water to last you for 7 days . There is also a deep water satcom transmitter that only we can pick up , So we will be monitoring you every second of the way . And you 've got a 40 caliber pistol with 100 rounds of ammunition . Good Luck Sir . We 've sent an encrypted message to the White House Sir . Vice President MacKenzie has been notified ! Good Luck Sir . Alright ! Try to save yourselves men ! Close the pod . Stand back Stand back ! Don 't close the pod ! God bless you ! We 'll refuel and will you find out what 's going on ? Yes sir ! And hopefully this won 't take too long . Good morning sergeant Oliver . Soldiers . Good to see you again sir . We have a situation . Will you and your second accompany me to the bridge ? Of course sir . You guys hang loose until I find out what 's going on . Yes sir , we are in the process of locating that signal as we speak . Captain Oliver and team are reporting for duty Admiral . At ease . Chairman Leary . Chief Oliver is present as you requested . Good morning Chief Oliver . Good morning Chairman . I know you 've been gone on a long rotation , and you and your men are certainly in need of a break . But , we have a situation of the utmost urgency , and we need your assistance . Yes , sir . Whatever you need sir . The President of United State was jettisoned from Air Force One in his escape pod at 0517 hours this morning . You and your team willcoordinate with Admiral Hanson , and CPO Vincent . You will rescue the president . I 'll call Hurlburt personally , and inform them of your new orders . Yes , Sir . Bring the President back alive , son . Yes sir . Nice to be working with you again Admiral . Chief Oliver . You were asked to run this operation by the JCS , not by me . So please take not that this is still my operation . I know that you are a risk taker . And risk taking often ends up with unnecessary loss of life , as you and I both know . There will be no risk taken onthis mission without my orders . This is the President of the United States . You will follow my orders to the letter . Failure to do so , will result in your immediate court martial . Do we understand each other ? Yes Admiral . Captain Phillips . Have Dr. Zimmer and Lieutenant Plummer meet us on the deck , Immediately . Yes Admiral . Chief Oliver . Assemble your team , and meet us on the deck as well . Yes Admiral Hanson . Dismissed . Your team is still prepped and ready to go ? Yes Admiral . Very good . Hey Rivas . What 's up ? What is it ? No clue . Boy she still has it in for you huh ? Yeah well the feeling is mutual . Just glad we got the call . You 'll be fine . Hey , It 's only the President . All units to general quarters , this is not a drill , all units to general quarters . Bridge ! Report ! Bridge ! We 're under attack , it 's some kind of ... Get to your team . Come on . Let 's go . I 've never seen nothing ... Whoa ! Careful Doctor . What the hell are those ? Riftia pachyptila . But of course they very extravagant embodiment . Non scientific name please , Doctor . Tubeworms , Admiral . But they seem to possess some sort of bioelectrogenesis , which is contrary to any species in its respective phylum ... They would appear to be surveying us at the moment . Tell me about . Do they seem hostile ? I don 't know , they 're worms . But they do seem angry . All teams lock and load . Woman : Chief , you seeing this ? Confirmative Rivas . Lock and load and get the team port side . Let 's go . Let 's go . Let 's go . - That 's what I 'm talking about . Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa . It does not look good . Nice and ease . The second that thing makes a move , I 'll blast his ugly ass to hell . ENGAGE ! ALL ENGAGE ! ALL ENGAGE ! Engage ! Engage ! Go go go go go . Free Fire Zone ! We are cleared hot for Tangos ! We are cleared hot for Tangos ! None of the artillery or SAMsare having any effect , Admiral . Suggestions ? Zimmer ? We need air support now ! Get us airborne . What are those things ? I don 't know Rivas . Preacher , Lay down some coverwhile I 'll I get into position . You gotta keep that thing busy . Alright Hondo . NOW ! The one in the middle is wounded . 12 o 'clock . Roger that . Concentrate fire on the wounded ones , 12 o 'clock ! Bring the 8-4 . Suck on this . Captain Phillips . Commencedamage control . Weapons systems are our first priority . I want to keep some aircraft up there . Get the tankers airborne to refuel and recall the rest . Dr. Zimmer . I want a completeassessment of what those things were . Attention on deck . At ease . Chief Oliver you still have a job to do . CPO Vincent . We 've established an approximate location of the President 's pod . At 7,000 meters deep . Now that 's beyond the maximum crush capacity . The structure of the hull seems to be fully intact . Butthere me a compromise in the oxygen recycler . We estimate that there may be as little as 4 hours of oxygen remaining . Now it 's gonna take you 3 hoursto safely descend to that depth in the diving bell . Upon your arrival , you 'll deploy with the fluorocarbon liquid ventilators . You don 't have much time gentlemen . So if you 're not up to task , I expect you to be forthcoming now . We can handle it . Admiral Hanson ? Yes Lt. Plummer ? Perhaps we should use the Prometheus DSRV2 prototype . Forgive me . This is Lieutenant Plummerl from the Office of Nava Research . She 's an expert on physical oceanography and marine electronics engineering . She will also yourmission advisor . Can you tell us a little more about the Prometheus , Lieutenant ? It 's a prototype deep sea piloted submersible that was set to be free cleared for duty this month . Now , it would take a quarter of that time to reach that depth . And give these circumstances , we should consider it . But it 's also not equipped with any type of armament . CPO Vincent , when are your Sub Surface Assault Vessels scheduled to arrive ? Within the hour , And then another 30 minutes to prep and deploy , Admiral . Alright . Let 's do it . Lt. Plummer , tell the Prometheus crew to prep and diagnostics , immediately . Yes Admiral . Chief Oliver . When the SSAV 's arrive to provide escort , you will launch . With all do respect Admiral , I don 't think we have time for that . We don 't know when these thing will strike again . Duly noted . And I appreciate your concern . But without a security escort , the mission is jeopardizes and more importantly so is President 's life . We will wait . We 'll be standing by , awaiting your orders Admiral Hanson . Very well . Dismissed . CPO Vincent . Dr. Zimmer . Come with me . I want to know what the hell it was that attacked my fleet . Alright gear up . We 've got a job to do . How much time is left ? Over 3 hours . This is ridiculous we got to wait for Vincent 's equipment . Admiral 's got a point though . Those things attack us down there , we 're screwed . It is highly maneuverable . Ok . Ah ten hut ! At ease ! Soldier ! I am commander Lt. Jude Barclay . I 'll be piloting the Prometheus . Means through your gear aboard now ! Thank you sir . Alright you heard him ! Grab your gear and load up . We being attacked again ? I need gunnery teams to coordinate , choose one organism and concentrate their fire- - On that one only . Same with air assets . Flight helicopters , Fixed wing . Pick one . Kill it and move on to the next ! I. I. Alright , that 's it . Everybody listen up . I 'm through screwing around down here . I 'm taking that sub out right now . We will not be able to defend ourselves down there . Vincent will never get his equipment aboard with those thing attacking us . And we 're just gonna loose more time . You wanna come ? Appreciate the company . If not , that 's fine too . Just to be clear , Admiral Hanson will probably have me Court Martialed for going against her orders . Which probably means she 'll court martial everybody else that comes along . The hell with it . I 'm with you Chief . I 'm ready to rock . I don 't know how I feel about it . I 'm in . Let 's do this . What are we waiting for ? Hoo-yah ! Hoo-yah ! Sergeant Oliver . Yes Lieutenant . Are you sure this is the right thing to do ? Ma 'am our job is to save lives . Regardless of the consequences or what may or may not be the protocol . Now that 's the President of theUnited States of America at the bottom of that ocean . So if it means saving hislife ... I 'm willing to suffer the consequences . Prometheus preparing for launch . Alright , Rivas get the coordinates . Got it . Elfman , do we have sonar ? Ready to roll . Alright , Captain Williams ... You 're all set Chief . Alright , let 's do this guys . You don 't have to do this . Listen up team ... there are a lot of under water currents as well as other variables that can affect this ships systems . You 're gonna need me for this . Plus there 's no telling what we might find down there . Right ? Welcome aboard Lieutenant . Commander Lieutenant . Still waiting for our orders . Did you see that ? Yes ma 'am . They seem to be communicating . When one gets injured , it retreats to the rear . And the others - Very sophisticated . CPO Vincent , What 's the sitrep on getting those SSAVs aboard ? ! Copy that Admiral . They 're coming in now ! We need more heavy ordinance port side , amidships ! Now ! I repeat , heavy ordinance port side , amidships ! TAKE COVER ! You still need orders ? Let 's go ! Admiral ! Admiral ! We just lost the Super Stallion . With the SSAV 's ? Damn ! Sir ! The Prometheus is launching ! Man : Prometheus launch come in . This is Prometheus launch , go ahead . What are you doing ? Why is that sub launching ? Lieutenant commander Barclay ordered it sir . Bridge . Bridge . The Prometheus is launching . Admiral Hanson ? The officer on the deck says that the Prometheus has launched . Raise them . Yes Admiral . Prometheus . This is the USS Nemesis . I repeat this is the USS Nemesis . Please respond . How do I respond ? Don 't respond . I 've got to say something . Do not respond ! DSRV 2 please respond . I say again Prometheus please respond . You 're killing me man . Chief Oliver you will respond and comply by immediately returning the Prometheus . Wow ! Really ? Hey . We all know what we 're doing . Damn right . I didn 't vote for him but what the hell . Let 's go get the President . Let 's go save the President ! Dr. Zimmer , I need you to get up there on that deck and get some kind of analysis on that thing . Copy that . You and the Admiral don 't have such a good working relationship , do you ? No ma 'am we do not . What 's going on between you two Chief ? Because if I 'm in the middle of it I 'd like to know what I 've gotten myself into . Alright . Three years ago she was station aboard the U.S.S. Harry Truman , We go a call to rescue one of her Tomcats that had gone down in Afghanistan . The Intel was ... Her Intel was shaky . We were almost to thecoordinates we were last given , And Admiral Hanson decided to pull from the mission . We were so close that I instructed my team to go on . We lost radio contact , and the LZ turned out to be a trap . We took some casualties ... One if which is my best friend . And there was a down Tomcat . No more then 2 clicks away from us . If Admiral Hanson would have had her act together then the pilot , my team , and my best friend ... would still be alive . - I 'm sorry . - Yeah . The loss of life is truly regrettable . But uh ... But what ? She did call the mission . You continued on . Had you take orders , your friend and teammates might still be alive . You don 't understand ... But we do . Sir ! We have something coming in on starboard side and it 's big . It 's coming in fast . I 'm clocking it at 30 knots . Alright , full throttle ahead . I. Full throttle . Barclay 's down ! Trip get up here ! - Rivas give us a hand ! - Yeah . Come on ! Woman : We 're loosing it sir ! Hold it tight . Hold this tight ! We can 't control her ! Oh my God ! All compartments secured . Oh no . Cut the power ! Cut the power ! Lieutenant . Cut the power ! Yes ! That 's what 's attracting it . - Are you sure about this ? - Yes . I 'm sure . Cut it off ! Cut the power ! Cut the power ! Our system is down . Power down . Your call Plummer . Alright Sir . It looks like it 's moving . Give it a few seconds . We power up now we 're liable to attract more of those things . And we got less then 3 hours to find this pod . The Gulf 's stream runs through here . If Mr. Elfman will allow me , I can navigate us into it . Let 's see . We intermittently feather the power on and off . Let the current do the rest . He 's coming around . Hey hey , Take it easy . Rivas . Can you feed me the ... Pod encryption code ? Yes ma 'am . Alright guys . I 've honed in the pod 's location and programmed the sub to take us there . We 'll use the Gulf stream to get us there . Margin of error , less the 1 percent . How 'd you do that Lieutenant ? Well it 's simply a matter of modulating the frequencies to compensate for the changes in the ocean as descend . Temperature , Salinity . Half a dozen other variables . But right now I suggest you hold on to something tight . Because we are in for it . It 's about to get ugly . It 's fascinating . Although it 's Riftia pachyptila or common Tubeworm . Such an enormous mutation of these quantities is highly unlikely . They span 30 meters ... above the surface of the water . It 's just the tentacles . They seem to have a centralnervous system of another ... Sea baring creature . If this is the case , the tentacles can be as long as 7,000 meters . Help ! Help ! Thank you . Admiral : Dr. Zimmer , are you on deck yet ? Actually no . But I managed to get a more manageable piece of specimen . I will be in my lab . Now watch this . You are telling me that these are appendages that attached to something bigger . How does this experiment tell you that ? Elementary neurology Admiral . You see where we inserted the catheters into the specimen ? These pathways are not too similar to nerves . This deeper network of innovative wiring , is congruous with the peripheral nerves of living organisms as we know it here on earth . Now , in order to initiate the electrical impulse I just demonstrated , it must originate from a central command center ora central nervous system if you will . This organism , in of itself ... it is not capable of producing the electrical discharge that we witnessed during those attacks . What did you mean by here on earth ? This is clearly anon-terrestrial organism Admiral . Look at it . But earlier you called it a reptia - Riftia pachyptila . Yes you called it a Tubeworm . Until I dissected it , yes . It did display some Riftia Pachyptila DNA but this is much more complex . I mean it 's simulated in a bio-mechanical organism from elsewhere other then our world . I mean the components that make up this energy pathways are anything other then this world . And you think that these are attached to something bigger below the surface ? I assure you my hypothesis is not mere conjecture , Admiral . Captain Phillips . Admiral . I want to run deep surface detection for massive organic life . Yes Admiral . Good work Dr. Zimmer . Hey sir . The water . It 's going shallow . I 'm reading depths of 7 fathoms . What ? 7 fathoms . That can 't be . Did you run diagnostic on your equipments ? Yes ma 'am everything is completely intact . Sir , the satellites are reading that we are approximately 7 fathoms of the same plain of the pod encryption . That can 't be . Something must have broken during the attack . We could be in an under water cavern which explains why the system is reading us 7 fathoms . It 's reading off of a falsebottom . She 's right . Blow ballasts . Blow ballasts . Check that out . Instruments are reading there 's oxygen . And pressure reads ... 1.03 atmospheres . That 's impossible . That 's normal AAP . We 're over 7,000 meters under sea level . Look for yourself . That would not make any sense . Unless it 's being controlled somehow . U.S.S. Nemesis , This is the Prometheus . DSRV 2 . Come in Nemesis ? Admiral : This is the Nemesis . We copy you Prometheus . Chief Oliver , what is your location ? We 've landed in what appears to be an underwater cavern , Admiral . Our depth however , isunknown . But the encryption appears to be within our perimeter . Approximately two clicks from our present location . Very well ... Lieutenant Plummer is with you ? Yes Ma 'am . Chief Oliver . Admiral : You have a mission to do . Admiral : So do it . And keep me apprised , do you understand ? Yes Admiral . Nemesis out . That was weird . I could havesworn the Admiral was gonna chew you a new one . She has too much to deal with up there . Now look , we have now less then a hour to find that Pod before the oxygen supply runs out . And the President dies . If he 's not already dead . Admiral . You ok ? Incoming ! Get back ! I 've got it . We 're approximately 2 kilometers dead ahead . You hear that ? Yeah . Elfman . Pipe in what 's going on out there . Copy that . What in the hell is that ? I don 't know . My god . Look at the walls and the ceiling . It 's mechanical . More like Bio-mechanical . cause if were fused with living tissue ... It 's definitely something constructed . But not man made . It 's non-terrestrial . She 's right . Something is really controlling the atmospheric pressure . Oh my god . It 's like an airplane graveyard . Guess we 're not the first ones down here . Do you think anyone 's alive down here ? Let 's hope so . Hey guys . I think that light up there is the President 's Pod . It 's possible . Could be some for of bioluminescence . This could be an alien outpost . Cuts right were we gotta go . Alright . Let 's keep our eyes peeled for a place to dock . This is absolutely amazing . This is the first real contact with non-terrestrial life . As far as we know it . I 'm sorry we do have more time to explore this . We have a job to do . I know . Alright , we 've got 45 minutes . Rivas , is there any change in that signal ? No Chief still dead ahead . Hanson . Set up temporary command HQ . And make sure instrumentation is up and running . Yes ! Yes ! Yes Chairman Leary sorry . We were just hit on the bridge . Chief Oliver and his team are the Prometheus Prototype . We just received transmission from them that they had surface in an underwater cavern . Yes . They located the Presidentsescape Pod beacon . They set out on foot to search for him . Admiral we have to get inside . Chairman : Have you heard from them since ? No sir . This is one hell of a junk yard . Bermuda Triangle is no joke . Alright . The eagle has landed . Ok team , suit up in your bio gear . We don 't know what organisms are in this environment . Command Barclay , it 's probably best if you remained in the sub . I 'll be fine Chief . Go do what you need to do . Alright . We 'll be back . This would explain the Bermuda Triangle . These ships . This aircraft . They were drawn here to power this city . And that ship , that ship , I don 't believe it . That 's the U.S.S. Cyclopes . It has to be . What 's a U.S.S. Cyclopes ? It was a cargo ship carrying coal . It vanished without a trace with the entire crew of 106 . After March 4th 1918 . In the Bermuda Triangle . You sure about that ? I 'm positive . I studied old photographs of it . 100 times . Then I guess this been going on for a hell of a long time then . I got the President 's signal . We 're triangulating right now . Alright everyone , we got to spread out . We have 29 minutes until the oxygen runs out in that escape Pod . Keep constant radio contact and stay frosty ! We don 't know what kind of life is down here . Hondo , Elfmam ... Let 's take the left flank . Right behind you . Dammit ! Alright . Everybody move out . Captain Phillips , I need you to find out where that Ohio class nuke is ? Yes Admiral . U.S.S. Maine . This is U.S.S. Nemesis . What 's your ETA ? Man : This is the USS Maine , we are approximately 105 nautical miles from your location , ETA 80 ZERO minutes . Dammit ! Well that sure as hell ain 't nobioluminescence . Hey chief you gotta see this . Yeah Honda . We see it . Guys we 're running interference . Rivas ! Come in ! Rivas ! Chief it 's her tracking device , but no Rivas . Chief it 's another one of those worms ! Where 's Rivas ? What the hell were you shooting at ? It was- - It was one of those creatures we saw at top sir . Son of a bitch . I told everyone " watch you six " . Now we 've got just over 14 minutes left ! We have to spread out to cover ground , and obviously we 're not alone down here . So stay sharp ! And don 't make me say that again ! Chief ! I got ! I got it ! I found the president 's pod , 30ft from your position . Good work Preach . You guys we got company , what ever you gotta do , you gotta do it quick . We 're working on it . He 's got a pulse . The President is alive . I need reserve oxygen . Get that mask on him immediately . I don 't know what that is . You guys we don 't have much time . You gotta do this quick . We almost got him . Hello Mr. President . Come on sir . We gotta move now ! Alright frag it preach , fire it up ! Come on this way . Ha ! Pull back ! Pull back ! Hondo ! Hondo ! President : What 's going on ? Are we clear ? The city 's lit up . Come on . President : Where am I ? Mr. President you are 7000 meters below the ocean surface , sir . I 'm Chief petty officer Trip Oliver with the United States Navy . President : Thank god . Let 's get out of here . Oliver : Are you ok to walk ? Yeah I 'm fine . - Follow me . - I 'm fine . What in god 's name is this place ? We believe it 's a city Mr. President . What we have seen suggests It was built by an alien civilization . What information do you have to say that there are aliens associated with this ? Extra terrestrial intelligence could be the only answer but something obviously went wrong down here . Obviously . This would explain the legendary magnetic forces of the Bermuda Triangle sir . Alright , we gotta get going sir . We 've got a rescue submersible waiting . Follow me . Chief , do you think we should call in a strike force ? I won 't do that . We don 't know enough about this thing sir . If this has anything to do with those tentacles up top , I say we blow them to hell . Tentacles ? What have we got chief ? Alright guys , we 're surrounded by tentacles , we 're gonna have to shoot our way out of here . Preacher you take 9 o clock , Williams take 3 o 'clock . I 'll get them 12 . Got it . Copy that . Let 's go ! That ship 's coming down guys , it 's on the move ! Go go go ! Go go go go ! Go go go go ! Come on ! Preacher let 's go ! PREACHER ! Where 's Preacher ? Where 's Preacher ? It 's too late for Preacher . Begin preparations for getting under way . Copy that . All stations are ready to get under way . Ready for dive . Copy that . Rigging for dive . Dammit power is out . Chief hit the auxiliary pump on the stern ballast . Stern ballast miles engaged . Main Ballast ! Main Ballast Engaged ! Auxiliary pump is down . Hey ! You need to talk to me . I need you to stay on the pumps . Lieutenant get back here ! Copy that commander . I know how to handle the wires . Come on you guys ! You 're right on ! Hold the blue wires . You got that . All engines in reverse . Full speed ! Copy that ! Hit me ! Hitting you . Come on you guys let 's go ! Hit me again ! Hitting you again . They 're attacking to the windows ! Let 's go ! 2 ... 1 . Hit ! We got power ! Alright come on ! Let 's go ! Nice work commander . Thank you . You too . Lieutenant commander , I don 't know we 've met yet . Lieutenant commander Jude Barclay Mr. President . I want to thank you for your service . Yes sir . My pleasure sir . You . You and your team for your sacrifice . I know how it is to loose men under my command . Thank you sir . But we 're not out of the woods yet sir , Right . It 's coming guys . HOLD ON ! Hydraulics at full . What 's happening ? Is that that thing that was chasing us outside ? No Mr. President , No it 's the Gulf stream . It 's what got us here . Hang on tight sir . I don 't remember that ! Full speed ahead . We 're at 30 knots sir ! Come on ! Come on ! We 're not gonna make it . Give it some more juice ! I 'm giving it all she 's got sir . The doors are closing . Suggest going left to course zero niner five , forty five degrees sir . Do it ! We don 't have any otherchoice ! Taking her 90 degrees left . Everybody hold on tight . Whoo ! Whoo Yah ! Whoo Yah ! Good job Lieutenant ! Good Job men . What 's that ? Are we inside that thing ? It 's unbelievable . This is not good . It 's coming at us ! Blow all tanks ! Blow everything ! Ballast Release ! - Look out ! - Watch out ! Coming from port side . Look out ! Abort ! The ship 's not designed for that . It will breach the haul . Is there anything we can do ? Just can 't get hit . Oh stop ! All stop ! Hard right rudder ! Hard right rudder ! The hull has been compromised ! Pressure system is at 70 % sir . Can 't take another hit like that . That thing is catching up to us guys ! We 're not gonna make it out with a rate like this . Lieutenant Commander Barclay ? What 's the power source for this vessel ? Silver Zinc batteries ? If we bypassed the regulator and overload protection device , we could in effect , deliver a surgeto the primary thrusters right ? It would give us a boost to go home right ? It would get us to the surface , because the overload could short out the electric batteries . And that would leave us dead in the water . Yes sir . Chief any thoughts ? I 've always been one for risks sir . I say we go for it . I 'm with Chief Oliver Mr. President . I saw we do it . Yeah Barclay ? Yes sir ! Let 's go ! Keep it steady . Will do . Plummer bypass regulator . Copy that commander . By passing regulator . She 's ready . You realize the battery overload could explode ? We know that ! Let 's engage ! Yes sir ! It 's almost at us ! Alright I think we have to stay in our seats for this . Lieutenant ? Yes ? Just let me know when the battery is fully charged . Yes sir , we are at 70 % . It 's coming for us . 80 % . 90 % . 90 % . 3.2.1 . Now at 100 % . Alright , Now ! At ease . The Prometheus is on board . Great . Go meet them . get a chopper ready for the President to immediate evacuation . And get Lieutenant Plummer and Chief Oliver down here immediately . I. I. Admiral . We need a medic down here ! Mr. President . Welcome aboard sir . Captain . Can you fill me in on what 's going on up here ? - If you 'll follow me ? - Thank you . Watch your head . We are preparing for your immediate evacuation . And I 'll fill you in . I want you to bring me to the bridge first . The bridge is gone sir . We have suffered some serious damage . And I have orders to evacuate you immediately . Well , you have new orders Captain . Take me up to the Admiral . Yes Mr. President . Mr. President so glad you 're alright sir . We have a helo for your immediate evacuation . Do you currently have any strategic submarines in your fleet ? We 're awaiting for the arrival of an Ohio Class SSBN . But Sir , we need to get you off this ship . I am not going anywhere . Now , Lieutenant Plummer and Chief Oliver I want you to tell the Admiral what it was that we encountered down there . I need to contact Washington immediately . Sir , it is to the utmost importance that we get you off this ship now- - I said , I am not going anywhere . You 're familiar with my record as a Marine , in combat . Of course . But your safety- - And we both took the same oath , Admiral . We both swore that we would defend the constitution of the United States against enemies both foreign and domestic . I took that oath and a few others . Yes sir . Now we are in contact , with an alien civilization for the first time in history and we 're being attacked . It 's my duty . To handle that attack . Mr. President . The White House . Thank you . Yes this is the President . President : Yes . I warned you about taking risks . This time you got lucky . Yes Admiral . Admiral Hanson , we discovered these tubeworms are connected to something much larger . Yes , Dr. Zimmer arrived at thesame conclusion . What else did you learn ? There 's a city at it 's core and a massive graveyard with ships and aircrafts . They are being are being drawn in by huge lighting panels that seem to be powering the city . Zimmer : Most likely the tentacles as well . Now there must be a limit to how much energy this creature can expel before it need to power down and regenerate . That would corroborate with the behavior that our specimen manifested . So we should direct an attack while it 's in this recovery mode ? I believe so . Yes . You have a plan ? Yes sir . We will coordinate our sub surface surge with the U.S.S. Maine and we will attack the creature while they appear to be in recover mode . Alright good . Do you have any theories ? We don 't have much to go on right now Admiral . But we do know that they 've been here for quite sometime . Those energy panels were erected to fuel the city and sustain life by gathering machines powered by nuclear energy or fossil fuels . And they 're clearly hostile so I believe we are doing the right thing . Take the fight to it while it 's still vulnerable . What the hell was that ? Admiral ! I believe out hypothesis is accurate ! Admiral : God all mighty . It 's gonna attack . We need to strike first . The Chief is right Admiral . I suggest we attack . Do it now ! All ships ! All Ship ! Authorized to engage ! Authorized to engage ! Nothing has any affect on it . It 's gonna attack again . We 've got to get the President back . Come on let 's go ! Go go go go ! Let 's go inside ! Mr. President , I am not sure that we have any other options . President : How long before that thing hits the coast ? Approximately 55 minutes sir . I 'm authorizing the use ofnuclear weapons . Contact the U.S.S. Maine . Immediately . You do realize Mr. President that the use if nuclear weapons this close to the shoreline will likely result in a nuclearfallout . Please Doctor . People will die ! Including us . A huge portion of the land will become uninhabitable for years to come . I 'm well aware of that doctor . I 'm also aware that 7 billion people on this planet . This alien race has declared unprovoked war on us . And in war , there will always be casualties . My job is to minimize that loss of life . So if a small percentage relative to the entire world 's population must perish , then those are the unfortunate consequences . I want a 50 mile radius no fly zone declared . This is ground zero . Yes , Mr. President . U.S.S. Nemesis to U.S.S. Maine . Do you copy ? U.S.S. Maine : We copy over ? U.S.S. Nemesis : Arm the nuclear weapons . U.S.S. Maine : Roger that . Nuclear weapons are hot . It is preparing to attack . Now . What was that ? U.S.S. Genesis . The U.S.S. Genesis , is gone . Where did it go ? Did we hurt it ? Ensign ? Current velocity and course will put it at Cape Hatteras in approximately 40 minutes . We can 't do a nuclear strike over the continent . It is one thing to do it out to sea , but over the continent- - We don 't have a choice doctor . People will die ! Millions ! Mr. President . Soldier . What about a strike to the center core of the spaceship . Point blank . What are you proposing Chief ? Those lightning panels we saw at the city . That 's what 's manufacturing power to this thing , right ? Yes Chief . So if we hit it as it 's source , couldn 't we produce some sort of implosion ? Yes , it 's very possible . We can 't just fire a missile into the core of that ship and hope to hit this city that you 're talking about . Not from the sub . No . Well if not from a sub then how soldier ? We rig a conventional warhead to a portable launcher . Captain Warren flies me in . And I deliver the strike point blank . We 're your best option Mr. President . It could work . Right . Well what do you think ? I 'm not sure Mr. President . Possibly it could be done . What concerns me is the amount of time it would take to orchestrate it . The ship would be that muchfurther in land . Soldiers . You men know what you 're doing , don 't yeah ? Yes sir . Yes sir . You 've got 15 minutes . Got it ? - Sir yes sir . - Move fast ! Chief Oliver . - Chief ! - Yes Lieutenant ? Yes . You were right about your decision . I see you when I get back . Ok team , this is your standard AT4 , but with some special modifications . We will equip the round with a specially modified low yield conventional warhead . No one 's ever fired anythinglike it before . So I wish I could tell you more about the trajectory . But truth is , I don 't know . Good luck Chief , Thanks Gunny . You know I can fly this bird in on my own Captain . I lost a lot of my team today and there 's no reason to add you to my casualty list . Flown a lot of missions together chief . This one 's no different . Yes sir . Give me a direct line to Chief Oliver . Let 's get a direct line to Air Hawk 1 . Copy that . Here you go sir . Chief Oliver . Yes Mr. President ? President : We only have one shot , you know that ? Yes Mr. President . Don 't worry . One shot is all I need sir . I 'm grateful for your service son . Thank you sir . Good luck . You ready Chief ? Let 's do it ! Radio : Foxtrot Romeo 1-33 ready for take off . Radio : Air hawk one , you are clear for take off , go get ' em boys . Copy that ! Warren : That thing is huge ! My god ! you were inside that thing ? Yeah ! You really think this is gonna work ? Hell yes ! Good enough for me . Dr. Zimmer . How long did it take that tentacle to regenerate in your experiment ? 2 minutes . The spacecraft is still on line with Cape Hatteras . It 's approximately fifteen minutes out , and the U.S.S. Maine is less than 10 minutes away . Air hawk 1 . The U.S.S. Maine is 10 minutes out . What 's your status ? We will engage in the next 6minutes and 30 seconds Admiral . Admiral Hanson ? Yes , Lieutenant ? The spacecraft takes exactly 2 minutes to regenerate between attacks . The same as Dr. Zimmer 's experiment with his specimen . Air hawk 1 . The alien spacecraft is attacking you in exactly 2 minutes intervals . You must wait until the next attack . You won 't make it to the core with the time that you have left . The thing is going to attack Hatteras next . We don 't have time to wait . That 's a negative Admiral . We 're out of time . Cape Hatteras is the next probable target . We need to take the shoot . No offense Admiral , but we can 't wait . Oh dammit . If he doesn 't get this done . We have to launch the nukes . Air Hawk 1 , you will ceaseengagement immediately . You must wait . If we abort , 20 thousand peoplewill be killed ! You don 't have time ! The greater population density takes precedence ! If you fail , the aircraft will go and attack Tampa or Miami and we will be force to fire nuclear weapons over a greater population . Cape Hatteras is a necessary sacrifice . He 's going in . Chief Oliver , you will stand down . I repeat , you will stand down ! Admiral : Do you hear ? ! Plummer : We have 4 minutes 45 seconds left Admiral . Radio : Foxtrot Romeo 1-33 we are entering enemy airspace . Listen , you and I don 't likeeach other and we probably never will . I understand that you blame mefor the death of you best friend based on orders that I gave you 3 years ago . But at this moment you will listen and you will obey my orders . You are to stand down till afterthe next attack . And the you are clear to engage . Do you hear me ? If we wait , we may not even survive to attack this thing . Look . Look . If you go in now maybe you save 20 thousand lives , but if you go in and you fail , and if you are killed ... then millions , and I tell you millions of people will die and that is because you have left us with no choice ! Sometimes you must accept a moderate casualty rate , in order to prevent a large one . That 's just the way it is ! You cannot save everyone ! Chief Oliver ? Chief Oliver , do you copy ? FLANK RIGHT ! My god . Chief Oliver . Oh my god . What happened ? Cape Hatteras has been destroyed . It 's gone . Oh my god . 20 thousand people . Chief Petty officer . You get in there and you destroy hell out of that ship ! Copy that Admiral . Let 's do this Captain ! Keep him apprised of how much time he has left . Yes Admiral . Chief Oliver ? This is Lieutenant Plummer . Copy Lieutenant . I 'll keep you up on your time . Plummer : You have exactly 1 minute 45 seconds left . Copy that Lieutenant . Warren : Foxtrot Romeo 1-33 entering the fisher . You see this Trip ? It 's incredible . Plummer : One minute 25 seconds left Chief . Copy that Lieutenant ! How far away are you from the center ? Chief : It 's hard to tell . But we 're gonna make it . Tell everyone not to worry . We know we can do this Chief . We got trouble . Hang on ! Hold it steady ! I can 't ! It 's too many of them ! I can 't fire ! Rotate it on it 's axis ! Why ? So I can kill us before they do ? Just do it ! Whoa ! Great job Chief ! Thanks Captain ! You have exactly 1 minute 10 seconds . Copy that Lieutenant ! They won 't have enough time to get out of there . He 'll do it . Plummer : 1 minute left Chief . Chief : Copy that Lieutenant ! I 'm glad it was you giving me the countdown . Me too . It would be a great time to use that thing ! Hold on a second ! We don 't have a second ! Trip ! Trip ! Where the hell are you ? I 'm exterior the bird , Captain ! I 'll be right up ! Well get some pass on that thing ! It 's pulling us down ! Plummer : 30 seconds left Chief . Plummer : 10 . 9 . Alright Captain bring us back around . I 'm ready to engage ! Plummer : 7 . You got it . Plummer : 6 . 5 . 4 . - Take that son of a bitch out . - Plummer : 3 . Plummer : 2 . Plummer : 1 . Get us out of here ! Nothing happened . Nothing ... happened . Air hawk 1 . Do you read ? Chief Oliver ? Captain Phillips ... Would you please call the U.S.S. Maine . Yes . Admiral . U.S.S. Maine . This is the U.S.S. Nemesis . What happened ? What was that ? It didn 't work . The explosion might have been absorbed . Yes ! Yes ! Whoo ! Look ! Up there ! It 's the Chief ! Warren : Foxtrot Romeo 1-33 to U.S.S. Nemesis requesting permission to land . We 're coming home . HOO-YAH !

 Corporal Reilly ? - Yeah ? Do we have patrols running the perimeter tonight ? Not that I 'm aware of . Why ? Because I think I 've got something . You always got something . No , this is definitely something . Red reading . Warm blood . I think it 's human . That 's gotta be a Sixer . And if there 's one , there 's bound to be more . We better get Wash on the line . Watch out ! The tree line ! Bet you 'll get a heat signature . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Dunham , go around . Go ! There . Biker One , coming your way . This won 't hurt a bit . - Oh ! - Hey . Hey . It 's okay . - It 's okay . - Calm down . Nobody 's gonna hurt you . Wash ? Where is she ? She 's right over there . - She 's here ? - Yeah . Hi . She 's terrified . I need to get everybody out of here and just clear some space for us , all right ? That includes you . Understood . But I wanna talk to her , Doc . Okay , just , give me a few minutes alone with her , all right ? Hello , little one , don 't be frightened . No one 's gonna hurt you . I 'm Dr. Shannon . Do you know where you are ? Under a table . I 'm sorry about my colleagues . I don 't think they meant to scare you . They want to give me a shot . I don 't like shots . You have a name ? If I tell you , can I go ? Perhaps , once I 've taken a look at you . Why don 't you come out here and talk to me ? No . Okay . What if I promised no shots ? Just this ? It 's just a light . It won 't hurt you . Look . Would you come out then ? Yeah ? Okay . Okay . I lost my bag . In the jungle ? They were chasing me and I dropped it . I don 't like chases . Well , that 's okay . We can get somebody to go and look for your bag . So , you gonna tell me your name ? Leah Marcos . So , do you have somebody waiting for you back at home ? Camp ? What about your mother ? Dead . Pleural ... Pleural sarcoma ? I 'm sorry . And your father ? Slasher got him . Mira says it happens sometimes . Anybody hungry ? Been awhile since you 've eaten ? Only get scraps . That 's why I ran away . I 'm gonna stay with my nana . She always has a lot of food . Does Nana live in Terra Nova ? 9-0-0-7 Newberry Avenue . Apartment C , District Ten . New Texas . I tried to find the portal but I got turned around backwards . Which way is it ? Finish your food . We 'll talk about it later . Taylor here . Talk to me . Perimeter is clear . Over . Copy that . Taylor out . Commander Taylor ? That would be me . You 're the bad man . You know , I remember you . Marcos , Leah Marcos . It 's been a long time since I 've seen you . Last time I saw you , you were just about that big . You were just a peanut . I grew . So you did . You know , there was a time when I knew everybody 's name in Terra Nova . Man , woman , and peanut . You got a brother , right ? Sam . Well , her BMI is lower than I 'd like it to be . And I 'd like to get some more fluids in her . But she 's generally healthy . I 'm going now . - Leah ! - Whoa ! Whoa ! Hold on there , kiddo . It 's okay . Hold on . It 's okay . Look , this is my husband . This is Jim . You 're all right , okay ? Listen , Leah . Uh ... We got something we need to tell you . I need you to listen to me carefully , Leah , okay ? You know the portal ? It doesn 't go both ways . - What ? Once you come through , you can 't go back . You 're lying ! I 'm sorry , sweetheart . So I can 't go see my grandma ? No , I 'm afraid you can 't . Where do I go now ? I can 't stay here , not with the bad man . And I can 't go back to Mira 's . She 'll ... She 'll hurt me for running away . Well , that 's one tough young lady . Hmm . Imagine that , humping through the jungle on her own , from God knows where . - It 's amazing she made it as far as she did . - You know , this could turn out to be a good thing for us . - How do you mean ? - Well , we need intel on the Sixers . Where is it they hide out ? Who 's their inside man here in Terra Nova ? But she 's just a kid . I mean , how much could she really know ? Well , we won 't know anything till we gain her trust , make her feel at home . How 's she doin ' ? You know , she 's still upset . But I think I managed to calm her down . You do seem to have that effect on her . Until we find her a permanent place to live , she 's gonna need somewhere to stay . Well , she can stay with us . Right , Jim ? Elisabeth , so , what , a family of six now ? Come on . She can have Josh 's room . - He 'll be fine on the couch for a while . - It 's settled then . Very good . Why do I have to give up my room ? Because Zoe 's six and I 'm a girl . Josh . - What does that have to do with anything ? Welcome to our home . Okay . Shh . That 's them . Be nice . Hey , everyone . Come and meet Josh and Maddy . - Where 's Josh ? - He 's down there . Hey . Everyone , this is Leah Marcos . Leah , this is our son , Josh . Hello . Welcome . And this is our eldest daughter , Maddy . She 's going to be starting an apprenticeship at the infirmary - With me tomorrow . - Hi . And this is our youngest , Zoe . Zoe has got a plant that eats bugs . In her spare time , she makes these toy dinosaurs . Pretty cool , huh ? Well , uh , bathroom 's through there . And kitchen 's over there . In case you get hungry again . Um ... Do you wanna see where you 're gonna sleep ? It 's okay . It 's only a light . Here , let 's make the bed up . We should probably let her sleep . Yeah . I don 't even know what the kid 's bag is supposed to look like . My guess , dirty . Hey , found it ! Give it here . Cute . Come on ! Still doing Taylor 's dirty work . What have you done with her ? How 'd Leah sleep last night ? Oh , she was out cold for 14 hours . And she refused to take a shower . Apparently , she 's afraid of hot water . Nice . Maybe we can trade . Leah can stay with us and Maddy can move in with the Sixers . More hot showers for everyone . Sounds like a win-win to me . Good morning . I think yellow 's your color . Don 't like yellow . Itches . Okay . Breakfast ? What about the hair , Maddy ? Baby steps , Mom . - She threw the brush at me . - Oh . Uh , Jim , can you look after the girls today ? No . Gotta go see Taylor . There 's a few things he wants to talk about . Shouldn 't take long . But I 've got Maddy with me at the hospital all day . - Okay . Uh , Josh . - Yeah ? Need you to babysit Leah and Zoe until I get back . A few hours tops . What am I supposed to do with them ? Think of something . Have fun . Hmm . So . Okay . What do we have here ? Rajiv Swarup . Thirty-six-year-old male . Laceration to his right arm . They gave me something for the pain . - But it still hurts like a son of a ... - Let 's take a look . Okay . How 'd this happen ? The Autoplow jammed up . I tried to fix it . Next thing you know , my arm 's sausage . Ooh , Maddy , come and take a look at this . Uh , that 's okay . I 'll just stand over here and observe from over here . Last little bit . It 's okay . So , that 's probably ... Went right into the ... I sent Washington out at dawn to look for the girl 's bag . Thought maybe it 'd buy us some goodwill . That 's what I wanted to talk to you about . Mornin ' , Tres . - Here you go , sir . - Thank you . How soon is too soon to start a de-briefing ? Today ? Tomorrow ? You might wanna give her a little more time than that . - I 'll discuss it with Elisabeth . - All right . Sixers ! Sixers ! Contact on Sixers . Sound the alarm . To your posts ! They 've come for me . Hey , you 're safe here , Leah . No one gets through the gates unless Taylor says so . They 've come for the girl . Whoever they 've got on the inside tipped them she 's here . Raise the gate . You got a spare one of those ? Thanks . So ? You have something that belongs to me . I want her back . Is that why you abducted my people ? Just returning the favor , Taylor . - The girl came to us . - I don 't believe you . I think your people took her . I think she 's being held as your prisoner . I think we both know that 's not true . You want your people back ? Give me the girl . This is not a negotiation . The girl will decide her own fate . If she wants to leave with you , she 's free to go . Then bring her out here , and let 's find out . As soon as you release my people . Let them go . - What ? - I said , let them go . Shannon , bring the girl out here . Dad came and got Leah . - What ? - Mira wants to talk to her . Okay , look after your sister . - But , Mom ... - Just do it , Maddy . Just tell the truth , Leah . It 'll be okay . Leah , look at me . Tell them you want to come home . Speak ! I ran away . I 'm not going back with you . I wanna stay here . She 's made her decision . The girl stays . Keep her then . She 's nothing to me . This is the second time you 've come to my gates and threatened the colony . There won 't be a third . Next time I 'm goin ' to war . Bring ' em in ! I want a list of everybody who was outside the gates from the time she got here till 0900 this morning . Sometime in that 24-hour window , the spy must 've got in contact with the Sixers . - Let 's find ' em . - Okay . You , hey , Peanut . You did great out there . You weren 't even scared , were you ? I could see that you weren 't . Why , you looked like you might even throw a punch or somethin ' . Thought I 'd have to hold you back . Hey , let 's see what you got , huh ? Come on . Let me have it . Whack him . Ow ! I knew it . That is a mean right hand you 've got there . Lethal . You keep practicing , when you turn 18 , I might have to put you in uniform . I like uniforms . Look , I know you 've heard some pretty terrible things about me . And I don 't know how life is out there with the Sixers , but , Leah , take a look around . People are happy here . They 're safe , everybody 's got a home . And nobody gets scraps . I don 't like scraps . We move all the time . And I don 't like that either . - Where do you move to ? - Lots of places . Mira never lets us stay in the same place for very long . You know how to read a map ? I like maps . My dad taught me how to read them - Before the slasher ate him . Yeah . I 'll tell you what . Maybe after you get settled in , you and I can sit down , take a look at some of the places you 've stayed . Maybe you can show me where your camp is . Deal ? Ow ! All right . I 'm gonna leave you in good hands . I need that list . Mmm-hmm . Come on . Hey . Hello , there . You remember me ? I remember you . Little Leah Marcos . Not so little anymore . You know , I never forget a name or a face . But somewhere along the line , I forgot my legs . So , if you happen to see them walking around without me , could you tell them I 'm looking for ' em ? Hey . Welcome back to Terra Nova , Leah Marcos . To Leah Marcos . To coming home . Cheers . Hey , maybe tomorrow we can put a comb through your hair , you think ? Don 't like combs . Okay . You guys should 've seen Maddy on her first day in the infirmary . She did a great job . Yeah , well , all I really did was reorganize your storage locker and told you a patient 's name . Well ... - Now , to my oldest daughter , the next doctor in the Shannon family . Hear , hear . Cheers . So , how 's the mole hunt going , Shannon ? Give me an update . Okay . There was a team outside the gates doing some perimeter mine repair from 0630 to about noon . Michelle Toomey and Nhat Trang . I know ' em both . Good , solid citizens . Nothing there . Okay . And Science Division had somebody out following up on a field study . Took the CSO 's rover , Robert Stanley . Stanley ? Did he go out alone ? Yeah . - Let 's talk to him . - Why him ? He came in on the Sixth Pilgrimage , but he didn 't leave with Mira . Only about half of ' em did . We investigated those who stayed , but we couldn 't find any connection to the Sixers . Maybe we missed something with Stanley . But I thought we 'd been over this . Yeah , well , keep goin ' over it till I say otherwise . I was completing my field study on wax moss . This ... I don 't care about your field study . Talk to me about the Sixers . I don 't know anything about the Sixers ! Well , you made a radio transmission at 1100 hours yesterday . - Who were you contacting ? - The lab . - To let them know I was gonna be late . Uh-huh . Hey , Commander . What brings you out here ? Somebody tipped the Sixers off about the girl . And you think it was Rob ? You can 't be serious . I thought I 'd ask a few questions , yes . Now , do you have any actual evidence against him , enough to take him into custody ? You his lawyer now ? No , funny enough , we don 't have any of those around here , do we ? Tread carefully , Malcolm . No , I don 't think I will . This is guilt by association . So what if he came over on the Sixth ? A lot of people did who have nothing to do with Mira ! Like the Commander said , we 're just asking a few questions . Relax . Yeah , and that 's what they said to my father , at the Edinburgh Hearings of 2119 . " Just asking questions . " That 's how it starts , Jim . Get off your high horse , will you , Malcolm ? You all right , Rob ? When did he get out here ? Don 't be nervous . It 's just a small test to see what grade level you 'll do best in . And then Monday you can start school . Sounds fun , right ? Don 't worry . Jim will be by in a couple of hours to pick you up . - Okay ? - Thank you . Bye . Aw . - She 's so cute . - Remember your first day at school ? You couldn 't wait to get there . Yeah , I loved it . I 'm not gonna lie . That 's my gal . Oh , I 'll catch up with you . Mr. Shannon . Sir , uh , I was hoping to talk to you about your daughter , Maddy . What about her ? Uh , well , as you know , I 've begun the initial stages of courting Maddy . - And I was wondering if I could ... - Excuse me , Reynolds . You are aware that I carry a gun , have a quick temper and tend to hold grudges , right ? Shannon . We 've had a break-in at the McMillen place , Pod D 26 . Let 's move . So I 've been at work all day . Came home and found the place broken into . And then this . What was inside ? I don 't know . I didn 't even know there was a hole there . - Could you give us a minute ? - Yeah , sure . Thanks . We need to find out who lived here before the McMillens . See if they know anything about what was buried under the floor . - That 's shouldn 't be tough . - Why ? This used to be Mira 's old place . We need to find Leah right now . Hey . What 's going on here , kiddo ? What did you take from that couple 's house ? Leah ? - Leah ! - Stop ! It 's okay . It 's okay . Give me the bag . There 's nowhere to run . No doubt about it , Commander . Mira sent her to infiltrate Terra Nova . She 's been lying to us the whole time . It was theater , more or less . Mira played me . She knew I 'd let the kid in . Knew I 'd believe her story . Knew I wouldn 't send her away . Especially if the Sixers made a show of trying to get her back . She 's a perfect spy . Young enough to be sympathetic but old enough to be capable . First chance she got , she broke into that house , grabbed this container , whatever thing this is . - Does it open ? - Sealed shut . No visible seams . Sounds like it 's hollow . Ask her how to open it . She might not know . And might not tell us , even if she does know . Bring her in . Come on . Have a seat , kiddo . Hey . I 'm not gonna ask you why you did what you did . But the Commander and I have a job to do . I need you to answer a few questions . We need you to be honest . You understand ? Young lady , look at me . You know what this is ? Is it a weapon ? Leah . No more lies now , okay ? What 's in there ? Why does Mira want it ? I don 't know . Mira didn 't say . She just told me to get it , so I did . Leah , why ? Why all the lies ? Because Mira 's got my brother . And she said she was gonna hurt him if I didn 't steal back that box . I 'm telling the truth . Take her to Pod Zero . Please ! I have to bring that box back to Mira or she 'll hurt my brother . She 'll hurt Sam . Please ! I 'm gonna detain her until we figure out exactly what 's goin ' on here . It 's fascinating . Oh . Maddy . Maddy , come and take a look at this . That 's okay . I 'm good over here . Well , you can 't learn anything from over there . Come and look . It 's a vesiculopustular lesion . - Very common in warm , humid climates . - No . Oh , hey . Excuse us . Something on your mind ? What if she 's telling the truth about her brother ? I mean , we should send a few people to check it out , just in case . I 'm not going to expend colony resources on a hunch . Mira might have planned this , too . You 'd be walking right into an ambush . But if there 's a kid out there that 's being hurt ? If . If I had some proof , that 'd be one thing . I got the word of a little girl , who managed to deceive me and every damn person in this colony . I know that . But , Commander ... The answer is no . That 's an order . Let it go . You got a wife , kids . Go home . You think Mira would really hurt her little brother ? There 's no way to know if she 's telling the truth about anything now . I 'm gonna go for a walk . Not such a great day in the infirmary today . Oh . Did the overachiever just kind of sort of achieve ? Instead of open heart surgery she could only do an appendectomy ? - Josh ? - Hmm ? Stop talking . At least I get my room back . Hey . Don 't beat yourself up . Leah let us down . - You did everything right . - I know . I just thought I was a better judge of character , you know ? Well , I thought I was , too . I don 't like people taking advantage of my family . Mom , Dad ! Look what Leah left . " I 'm sorry , I had to . " So she wasn 't lying about her brother ? Which means he really is in danger . Maddy ? - Hey . - Hey . Are you doing anything right now ? Yeah , I 'm just picking up a few things . Uh ... I wanted to talk to you about something . - I ... - Thank you . I wanna declare my intentions for you , Maddy Shannon . You wanna do what to me ? To court you . Court , you mean like date ? Yes . Why didn 't you just say that ? Because that 's not how it 's done . According to the Commander , I have to address you in a certain way . And then speak with your father . And then call at your house . And then have the honor of escorting you to a planned activity or event outside the home that might please you . People used to do it this way . Well , technically , they will do it that way in the future . But then again , they 'll also wear corsets . So , may I have the honor ? Yes . Yes , you may . Awesome . - Yeah ? - Yeah . 'Cause I was just having the worst day ever . Well , tell me about it . Well , where should I start ? The part where I almost puked on a patient in front of my mother ? Or the part where Leah just ... Start at the beginning . I have time . Crap . You 're the new cop . Where am I ? Did Taylor send you ? I came for Leah 's brother . She said you were gonna hurt him . And you believed her ? She only lied when she had to . The boy was never in danger . I just needed to motivate her to get her to do what I knew she could . What 's in the box that 's so important ? Right up here in the canopy , huh ? No wonder Taylor can 't find you . I hear he 's taken quite a shine to you . I have to say , I 'm surprised , considering the way you snuck into his colony . You sure know a lot about what goes on inside of Terra Nova . Almost makes me think ... Ooh , I don 't know . You got yourself a spy or something . Maybe I 'm psychic . Maybe . Or maybe you should 've had your spy get the box for you , instead of sending a little girl ! Or did you not wanna risk exposing whoever it is ? - I can see why Taylor values you so much . - Ah . Yeah . Well , that 's ' cause I got to save his life once . It was thanks to you , as a matter of fact . You know , in a way , I 'm glad you did . If Carter would 've killed him , that would 've made a murderer of him , which would only make my job harder . And what is your job ? Taylor 's pissed off some very powerful people back in 2149 . They want him gone . Gone ? If it wasn 't for Taylor , Terra Nova wouldn 't have lasted as long as it has . - If the colony survives , everybody ... - Oh , come on , Shannon , don 't tell me you believe in all that starting over crap . It 's not what Terra Nova 's about . Not now . Not ever . Then what 's Terra Nova really about ? You 'll see . But you don 't wanna be on the wrong side of history , Shannon . Be smart . Do what 's right for your family , 'cause sooner or later , we 're gonna take Taylor down . Why ? What does it get you ? It gets me my family . I have a daughter , back in 2149 . Sienna . She was four when I left . I do my job , they make sure I get to see her again . Who 's they ? You 're free to go . Wait . Leah ! Sam ! It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay . I ought to run you out of town for disobeying an order , Shannon . Yeah , but what the hell . You reunited a family . Terra Nova just officially grew by two . How 'd you make it out of there with the boy ? Mira let us go . Well , that doesn 't sound like Mira . Doesn 't sound like her at all . I think she was trying to prove something . Like maybe the Sixers aren 't so bad . Were you convinced ? I might 've been . If they hadn 't busted up my ribs . Did she say anything I should know about ? Well , she 's not a fan of yours . I meant something I don 't already know . I sure as hell would like to know what 's in that box she sent the kid here to steal . No luck getting it open , huh ? Go get yourself bandaged up . Let your wife know you ain 't dead . Ooh , if I had a terra for every time I 've had to put you back together ... You 're making me sound like Humpty Dumpty . I married a doctor for a reason . Hey . - You did good . - Hmm . Ow . Sorry . Sorry . You know , Leah 's gonna be all right because of you . Well , there 's a lady from the Third Pilgrimage who 's interested in taking Leah on long-term . Lost her husband a few years back . Well , hopefully there 's room for two . Hmm . Hey , where 's Maddy ? Oh . Well , to save her nerves and her stomach , - I 've released her from her apprenticeship . - Oh . Yeah . I don 't think the reality of being a doctor quite lived up to her romance of it . Hmm . More blood and guts in the real world . Sorry to say , I haven 't got the foggiest idea how to get it open . Tried everything . Well , keep trying . Mira went a long way to get whatever is inside the damn thing . Sooner or later , she 'll make another play . - Keep it safe . - Hmm . Hey . Hi . Someone wants to talk with you . You know what I heard ? I heard the lady that you 're gonna be staying with is super nice . So use your ... Thank you .

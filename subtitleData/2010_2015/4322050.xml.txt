 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Why am I having these headaches ? When MacPherson was part of your consciousness , he may have left something behind . Paris , 1899 . My daughter , Christina , had been murdered . H.G. Wells is to be fully reinstated as a Warehouse agent . Thank you , sir . And no matter how much good she 's done for all of us , I 'll never trust that woman . Someone has found the lost Warehouse . It was always believed to be somewhere near Alexandria . Warehouse 2 is back online . So , we need to find Warehouse 2 and shut it down . - H. G ! - Hey ! Guess who just saved the day ? Myka ! Myka ! Myka , come on ! Pete ? Come on . Get up . We got to go . Pete , where am I ? Egypt , Warehouse 2 , and we are in big trouble . Big bump . I know . I got one to match . What 's that sound ? That 's sand . No , I 'm sorry , scratch that . It 's the whole freaking Sahara desert . This place is filling up with sand , Myka . All right , the way we came in is history . I don 't know , when H.G. Bolted , she must have triggered some kind of self-preservation thing , something that protects the artifacts . H.G. , she played us . She played me . Oh , big time . Oh , I 'll kill her . I 'm going to kill her . Myka . What ? Mmm . I get the whole anger thing , but could you please just channel it into finding us a way out of here ? Okay . Okay . Our Warehouse , right ? There 's a backdoor ... Yeah . ... in our Warehouse , so there must be one here , too . Bingo . Right . Pete , look , a hatch ! What ? Whoo-hoo ! Myka , you found a hatch ! Yeah ! A hatch ! Whoo ! 100 feet up there , so not as good , but ... Well , it wouldn 't be up there if there was no way to get to it . Right . Right ? So let 's look for something , you know ? Egyptian endless wonder . Right . Yeah ! Okay , just keep searching the shelves . Okay , there 's got to be ... There 's got to be something . I don 't know , like a magic ladder or a catapult or something . And go ! And move ! It 's probably just a rug , Pete . And fly ! Oh , my God ! Pete , I 'm looking at the 10 original books of Plato . Is there a chapter on flying ? Not that I remember . Oh , oh , oh ! What about ... What about ... What about a snake around a staff ? Isn 't that a medical symbol ? Uh , that 's probably the rod of Asclepius . It 's probably some sort of healing device . Yes . We can definitely use this . Or not . Pardon me , sir . Pete , Pete , over here ! Whoa ! Right ? Okay , these wings were probably designed by Daedalus . He was the father of ... Icarus . Ha ! Even I know that one . Turn around . What ? Why me ? You 're the one that eats like a bird . Well , just ... Just don 't get us too close to the sun , okay ? They smell . Ooh ! Whoa ! These things actually attract wind . Yeah , they generate their own lift . Holy crap . Whoa ! Can you imagine watching a Browns game like this ? Yeah . I bet that 's exactly what Daedalus had in mind . Up . Pete , up ! Huh ? Oh ! The hatch ! Yeah ! Get it , get it , get it . Okay , stop , stop . Yeah , yeah . Pull . It 's stuck . Well , yank it . Yank it hard . Really ? At a time like this ? I 'm sorry . Oh ! What ? Oh , come on . Pete , do you hear that ? That 's the Farnsworth . It must be working again . Okay , we must be high enough . Back pocket . What ? Okay . Yeah . Ohhh ! Stop laughing . Okay . Okay . Okay . Artie ? Hi . Myka , listen , H.G. Is a bad guy . We know . Pete , good , you 're together . Yeah , we always kind of thought we 'd go out this way . Look , Artie , Valda 's dead . Warehouse 2 is filling with sand . Artie , listen , I 'm really sorry . Tell Kelly that I love her . It 's all my fault . Tell her that ... Shh . Shh . Close your eyes . Close your eyes ? That 's the last thing he 's going to say to us ? I always thought it would be a little more , you know , meaningful . He didn 't even say goodbye . I know . Oh ! Myka , hold on ! Hold on ! Pete ! Close your eyes ! Ah ! I can 't see ! Oh , God . The wings of Daedalus . Good call . Don 't just flap there . Come on out . Here we come . Hold on . Whoo ! Man , you have got to let me keep these . Oh , right , because they worked out so well for Icarus . Artie , who are you ? Jerusalem Jones ? What ? I just bought this . So , how 'd you find us ? I pinpointed the coordinates on your Farnsworth . It 's a good thing it started working again . Yeah . They 're designed to work deep underground , but when I lost the signal , I realized that H. G. Had jammed it . I knew you were in trouble . When I got here , I reset the frequency . It was a piece of cake . Finally ! Listen , H.G. ' s a bad guy . We know ! Judging from the depth of her preparation , it seems obvious to me that H.G. Wells has been planning this for a long , and I mean a long time . She hacked into the Warehouse account to fund those students . Yes . And she discovered , somehow , the location of Warehouse 2 , even before she was bronzed . Did MacPherson know that ? Yeah , but she needed experienced agents to get in there . Well , she obviously wanted an artifact , but which one ? The place is filled with sand , Artie . It 's going to take months to dig out . Artie , Artie , is there ... Is there some kind of inventory of Warehouse 2 ? Yes . For a time I had a cognitive connection to Warehouse 2 . Much of its inventory was downloaded into my mind . Hell of a backup drive . Can you access it ? I can try . It 's fading . Tell me quickly what you remember of H. G. ' s last position . Myka and I were in the office trying to figure out where the key went , right ? And then H.G. Ran to see if she could turn off the orb . She went to the main floor . Can you describe the area in which she was ultimately found ? Uh , there was ... There was vases . There was lots of clay pots and vases . How can she spot what 's missing ? She 's just that good ? Yes . Now , I assume that Warehouse 2 has an inventory system like ours . Each item is labeled with a hieroglyph of Anubis . If Anubis is sitting , then the item is in its proper place . If Anubis is running ... Ah . A rack of spears . One is missing . What kind of spears ? Missing spear , labeled in any way ? Yes . Fading . I can 't tell you . The image is gone . Okay , no , Artie , this is progress . Right ? Now we know it 's a spear . We don 't know where she is , but ... Paris . I 'm still tracking H.G. ' s access to funds . She just bought a ticket from Cairo to De Gaulle . Why Paris ? When Pete and Myka were in 1961 , H.G. Told me her daughter was murdered in Paris . Okay , so she 's returning to the scene of the crime . Or that 's where Christina 's buried . Maybe the spear has resurrection properties . She wants to bring her daughter back from the dead ? I don 't know about spears , but I can tell you resurrection is a dangerous practice and always comes at a price . Yeah . Look at Mickey Rourke . So ... All right , Pete , Myka , you go to Paris . Claudia , you try to find out exactly where Christina is buried . I will do research on spears . Mrs. Frederic ... Will just be Mrs. Frederic . Hey , it 's Kelly . Do you mind ? Sure , Pete , we 've got nothing but time . Kelly , hey , I was just going to call you . What happened to you ? Two days ago we had a vague conversation about moving in together , and then ... Then you disappear . Ugh , Kelly , God , I 'm so sorry . You know , you must think I 'm the biggest jerk in the world . Well , I went between that and wondering if I should be calling hospitals . No , no , no , no , I 'm fine , I 'm fine . It 's a long story . I had a sudden business trip . Pete ! Look , Kelly , we got a lot to talk about . Pete , you know , if you don 't want to see me anymore , it 's ... No , no . Kelly , look , I love seeing you . Okay ? You 're my happiest place on Earth . You mean that ? I know it in my soul , okay ? I just ... I 've got this one more trip , and then I 'm yours completely . The minute you get back . The second I get back . And , Kelly , I love you . Okay . I said it . Yes , I even said it first . So go ahead , make fun . I 'm really glad you found someone , Pete . You deserve it . Okay , now I really feel like a girl . Well , hike up your skirt , because we got a bad guy to catch . Booyah ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hang back there , Pointer Sister . Sorry , sorry . I thought ... You know , handling some ancient spears would trigger a notion , but ... Okay , well , I 'm sorry to interrupt you while you 're handling your ancient spear , but I found Christina 's grave site . Good . Did you let Pete and Myka know ? I texted them . They land at De Gaulle any minute . All right . Ahem . Um ... Artie , can I talk to you about something ? Will it make me feel old and uncomfortable ? Not this time . All right , go on . Okay . Um , when Dr. Vanessa was here trying to save Mrs. Frederic , she ... She said something that kind of scared me . When it looked like Mrs. F might not make it , she said that I should be ready . Oh , and you want to know ready for what , hmm ? Actually , no . Er , I 'm ... I 'm pretty sure I 'm not ready . I know that I might talk big sometimes , Artie , but I can 't even buy a wine cooler in this state , so whatever you might have planned for me ... Breathe , breathe , breathe . You can do whenever you want . You control your own destiny . But she said it was ... No , nothing has been decided . Or will be decided without your complete consent . You promise ? With all my heart . You 'll live the life that you want . I 'll make sure of that . Thank you . According to Claudia , the Cimetiere de Rennes should be right around this corner . H.G. ' s probably already here . Good . First time , shame on her . Second time , I 'm bringing that bitch down . I love it when you talk dirty . What ? Where 's the cemetery ? It has to be here . This is the address . Excuse me , hi . Excuse me . Do you speak English ? We 're looking for the Cimetiere de Rennes . Cimetiere de Rennes moved many years ago . To where ? Ew . What now ? Okay , look , if H.G. 's plan was to resurrect her daughter , then she needed to arrange for the upkeep of her remains , right ? Which means there 's an estate . And estates have lawyers . French lawyer . Mr. Sempe , thank you for taking this walk with me . If you want to visit Christina Wells ' resting place , I can give you the address . You don 't need me . Oh , but I do . I don 't want to go all around Paris shooting people . As my lawyer , you can give me full access . Full access ? I don 't understand . You don 't have to understand . You just need to sign whatever needs to be signed . And then what ? And then maybe I 'll let you live . You check the girl . I 'll look for the lawyer . Okay . It 's empty . He 's gone . She 's in shock . Look , if H.G. Shot her with the same gun that she used on us ... Then she 's come and gone already . Pete , look . I 'm grateful she has been taken care of to my specifications . I signed the papers . You can do whatever you want in here . May I leave now ? In a moment . Don 't be rude . Remove your shoes and step into this , please . Madame , please , I 'm just a simple lawyer . Not even a very good one . Now would be nice . What is it ? Primordial tar from Pitch Lake in Trinidad . Don 't really have time to explain what it does . You wouldn 't believe me , anyway . I 'm stuck . You have no idea . Help me ! Help me ! No ! No , if you put water in it , it turns it into a tar pit . Don 't fight it , dude . That 's what the wooly mammoths did . Pete , H.G. , she ran down there . What on Earth was that ? Mr. Sempe , you mind waiting outside ? Happily . This place is a labyrinth . She 's gone . Pete , would you mind ... What ? You know , looking to see if Christina , if ... Ew ! Yep . She 's dead . Still really dead . Okay . Pete . Yeah ? H.G. Didn 't even have the spear with her . Yeah , but we don 't even know how it works . No , no , something ... Something is wrong . She took something . Something that 's missing . The handle ! Are you sure there was a handle ? Yes . And the other one 's right there . Okay , if you can 't see it , the ends have points . Like arrows . I 've seen that shape before . Where ? I don 't know what it is , but I can 't get it out of my head . Look . MacPherson must have left an image of it inadvertently by the Pearl . Okay , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Let 's look at that shape from different angles . Now , what did Myka say ? That the tips have points ? Like arrows . Like arrows . All right . Like arrows . Now , does this suggest any ... Mrs. Frederic , do you see ? See what ? It 's not a spear . It 's ... The Minoan Trident . So , a bad thing . What 's the Minoan Trident ? A weapon of mass destruction . The first weapon of mass destruction . Okay , okay , wait , the Minoan Trident was the first weapon of mass destruction ? The Trident was the first artifact locked away by Alexander the Great , in what became Warehouse 1 . In the 15th century BCE , the Minoan civilization was destroyed by a catastrophic volcanic eruption . Oh , I know this one . It 's the Thera volcano , which created the island of Santorini . The Thera eruption was thought to have been caused by a Trident , which when jammed into the ground three times , causes a fissure in the Earth 's surface . If done in the right place , it could unleash a volcanic eruption . Is that what Plato based the story of Atlantis on ? Right . Right . Poseidon had a trident . I played him in fifth grade with a pitchfork and a toga . Beat out Ralph Brunskie for that part . Kid had a voice like Jennifer Tilly . I am Poseidon . I 'm terribly sorry . Que sera . Peter , the Trident is real . That 's one of the reasons the Romans came to Egypt . Caesar wanted that power . That explains why the Trident is in two pieces . H.G. Found part of it in the 1800s , and hid it on her daughter 's casket . And MacPherson de-bronzed her , so he could find Warehouse 2 and the other half of the Trident . That 's why she killed him . He was about to tell us . The question is , now that she 's got both parts , what is she planning to do with them ? Someone evil just bought a plane ticket . To ? Casper Natrona International , Wyoming . That 's only two hours away from here . All right , get back here right now . MacPherson was collecting artifacts to sell them to the highest bidder . Do we think that H.G. ' s doing the same thing ? Let 's hope so . The alternative could be unpleasant . Good boy . You did great , Harvey . There 's a lot less to lick now , but I promise you it 'll make your life a whole lot easier . Oh , Pete . Gorgeous . Oh , look , Harvey , he even engraved it with our favorite breed . Let 's send him a picture of us using it . It looks like things are okay between me and Kelly . Why would you say that ? She sent me some pictures ... With her and a little puppy . Look , she 's powdering his nose . Look at the little puppy ! Okay , it 's official . I 'm a girl . You had a lot of vibes about H.G. , didn 't you ? No . Not really . God , you 're a terrible liar . What ? Look , I trust your instincts , Myks . We 're partners . A team . Yeah . I put the team in danger because I thought I knew better than everybody else . Look , you need to forget about that . Okay ? There 's no way that any of us could be sure that ... No , there was plenty of doubt , from everyone but me . H.G. Has a huge advantage , Myka . She 's willing to lie , steal and kill to get what she wants , and we 're not . So , I 'm going to side with us on this one . With you . - Lattimer . H. - Oh , good , you 've landed . I do hate voicemail . Oh , hey , lady cuckoo . We were just talking about you . Uh , well , what , are you calling to play a little game of Let 's Make a Deal ? Oh , I 'm afraid not , dear boy . Oh , come on . Nut job like you must have quite a wish list . How about a little electroshock therapy ? Zap the crazy right out of you . Run a trace on Pete 's phone . Already happening . We put a trace on both your phones as soon as you got to Paris , just in case . Once I lock in on her signal , I can track her with this . With what ? What is that ? Show me . Are you messing around with stuff in the Farnsworth aisle ? I 've been quite impressed , keeping up with me as you have . Not quite catching me , of course . But then , I am me . Well , go ahead , get nice and comfy . Oh , don 't worry . I 've closed all my accounts and buried my trail . So , now , are you just calling to brag , or did you get a sudden craving to be bronzed again ? Because we can make that happen for you . For such a mediocre kisser , I 'd have thought you 'd at least have brains . Yeah , well , you taste about as old as you are , so right back at you there , grandma . Now , what do you want ? Just to suggest that you check in on Kelly about now . Pete , don 't . Listen , you leave her the hell alone . She has nothing to do with this . Oh , I haven 't done a thing . But you ... You sent her a lovely gift . I 'm sure she 'll be crazy for it . We have to get to Kelly . No , no , no . No . No . She 's just trying to distract us . Artie , I can 't stay here . I got to go . All right , just watch your back . Got it . Where is she ? Wyoming , and not far , but ... What ? She 's not stationary . She 's moving . Looks like l-26 , heading for Bryson Reservoir . Bryson , Bryson ... Bryson is in the middle of nowhere . I mean , it 's not even a tourist stop on the way to ... Yellowstone . So what ? She 's on a road trip to see America ? She can 't be . You don 't think that ... You don 't think what ? She can 't be what ? The Yellowstone Caldera . Artie . I 've got a map here . Not this . This ! Seismic hazard map of the six known supervolcanoes in the world , and the most powerful of which is thought to be Yellowstone Caldera , which is under ... Well , it 's under Wyoming , Idaho , and Montana . Are you kidding me ? People go there for vacation . If H.G. Were to jam the Trident into the ground there ... It would cause a chain reaction of monstrous proportions . Millions would die immediately , but there 's a far greater problem . Bigger than millions would die ? The last supervolcano that erupted was 75,000 years ago . Triggered an ice age . Only 6,000 humans survived . Claudia , you go back up Pete . You and I are going to Yellowstone . She 's taking a car . We 'll take a chopper , we 'll get ahead of her . Go , go . Right . Hey . You know , this is kind of cool . Good luck . Yeah . - Can we get there in time ? - We have to . Kelly , are you here ? Kelly ? Kelly ! I 've been waiting for you . Oh , my God . You scared me to death . I thought ... Hey ! ( EXCLAIMING ) Kelly ! Wait a minute ! Just hold on ! Just cut it out ! That is exactly what I intend to do , cut it out . This has to be an artifact . Even I can 't make women this angry . Just stand still . Listen , Kelly , somebody did something to you , and I don 't know what , but just please , you got to trust me . I love you , Pete . Oh , babe . I love you , too . And that 's why I have to kill you . Really ? Really ? No ! Give me that . Kelly ! Pete , what are you doing ? Kelly , are you back ? What 's going on ? Let go of me . Must be the knife . What , she gave you Lorena Bobbitt 's knife ? I 'm so thirsty . Here , come on , babe . Come on . Come on . Oh ! There you go . I need some water . Are you okay ? No . Get me some water . All right , hold on . I 'll be right back . Ow . Oh , God . Are you putting me down ? Now , we 'll do this the easy way . Artie , something 's fishy . Pete won 't answer his phone . Don 't worry . Claudia has his back . She 's got to be right around here . The magma chamber is highest here . Right here ? Yeah . Okay . What 's that for ? This is a subterranean heat sensor . Reaches thousands of feet into the ground . Okay , wow , the temperature is astronomical here . If she 's coming , she 's coming here . And here she is . I 'm not surprised you found me , but I 'm quite baffled that you expect to do anything about it . And what could you possibly want that you would go to these lengths ? What ? Money ? Power ? What ? Nothing . Nothing ? What do you mean , nothing ? You obviously know what you 're holding . This isn 't a bargaining tool . I intend to use it right here , right now . Hi , Kelly . What 's up ? Claudia , you can 't be here right now . I have work to do . Ah , Kelly , hey , hey ! Hold on a second . What are you doing there ? Chopping Pete up into little bits . Uh-huh . Right . And why ? Because I love him . That 's a beautiful way to show it , but ... Claudia , if you don 't get out of my way , I 'm going to have to kill you . I 'd really rather you just give me the axe . All right , then . There 's got to be something here . Did somebody send you that axe ? Let go of me ! What 's new here , Kel ? Compact ! Hello , antique-y . Where 'd you come from ? Pete sent it to me . Hang on a sec , Pete , kind of got my hands full here . " L.A.B. " Laboratory ? No . Ah ! Initials . Okay , Lonny ? Lindsay ? Larry ? Lizzie ? Lizzie ! Lizzie Borden ! Whoo ! Lizzie Borden took an axe and gave her father 40 whacks . And when the job was neatly done , she gave her mother 41 . No ! No ! No ! Oh , my God . What 's going on ? And why is Pete tied to my table ? Claudia , what 's happening ? It 's okay . Somebody , I can 't tell you who , gave you Lizzie Borden 's compact . Lizzie Andrew Borden . I did a term paper on her . Apparently , you name your daughter Andrew , and she chops you into little bits . Big surprise . I tried to kill Pete . No , it 's ... It 's okay . Why would I do that ? Well , looking into the compact probably makes you kill the thing you love , so maybe Lizzie did it after all . What are you talking about ? No , no , baby . Baby , this is good . Okay ? This means that you love me . Stop . See , because the truth is ... Stop . I tried to kill you . Wait , Kelly . Hey , Kelly . Kelly , it 's all right ! Just give it a rest for a bit . Give her head time to catch up . But , wait , I don 't understand . Why would you kill millions of innocent people ? Innocent ? Open your eyes , Myka . Have you looked at the world in which you live ? So because you lost your daughter , because you 're angry ... No , don 't you dare . This may have begun with Christina 's murder , but it 's not about that . Yeah , I foolishly believed that if I could find a way to travel through time , then things would have improved . A Utopia would have emerged , but here we are , over a century later , and things have actually gotten worse . The divide between rich and poor , hunger and famine , war and violence and hatred , all flourishing beyond control . Indeed , men have found new ways to kill each other that were inconceivable in my day , even by fiction writers . But millions of us are struggling against that every day . This planet needs a rest from what you 've done to it . It needs a chance to repair itself . Oh , my God , you seriously intend to start another ice age . The only way to save this world is by destroying the parasites who are eating it alive . I don 't normally do this . And you 're going to wish you hadn 't . Artie ? Oh ! Artie , what is it ? Artie , what is it ? The Corsican Vest ? Afraid so . Artie , what 's ... What 's happening ? Well , the vest , it belonged to the Corsican brothers , twins . When one of them got hurt , the other felt it . You did that to yourself . Where did you find it ? Venice ? Fort Lauderdale . Of course . Hey ... Myka ! Three times . Don 't let her do it three times . I won 't . I wouldn 't . Myka , talk to her . Talk to her . So what ? The entire planet is subject to your judgment now ? What about the millions of mothers who are going to lose their daughters , just like you lost Christina ? Is that right ? This is no world for a child . I don 't think you believe that . I do . Watch me . No ! Myka , that 's two . You are lying to yourself . You never wanted this . If you wanted to kill Pete and me , you would have done it in Warehouse 2 , or in Paris . And Artie , you would have let him die in Russia , but you didn 't . I needed you to trust me . No . You needed us to stop you . You wanted us to follow you and stop you . That 's why you called Pete this morning . Think , Helena . You 're so filled with grief and anger , but there is a part of you , I know it . There is some small part of your soul that knows that this is wrong and that part is still alive , and it 's just pushing to get through . Yes . That 's the part that refuses to kill the very people who can stop you . No . Stay away from me . All right . If I am wrong , then kill me . Do it ! Kill me now ! I mean , we 're all going to die anyway , right ? So what 's the difference ? So , shoot me . Shoot me now . Kill me , but not like that . Not like a coward . I want you to look me in the eyes and take my life . Come on . Do it . Do it ! So , if you 're not going to put H.G. Wells back in the Bronze Sector , where 's she going to go ? Some other weird place that we don 't know about ? The less you know , the better you 'll be able to do your job . That doesn 't sound good . You both did excellent work retrieving that artifact and preventing a worldwide disaster . That , of course , is the prime directive of Warehouse agents . H.G. Wells was a formidable opponent . She fooled us all . She didn 't fool Artie . Unfortunately , still a lousy shot with a real gun . Ah . Are you going to die on us every year ? Because it 's getting kind of boring . I 'm going to keep dying until it takes . Or not . Ow ! It hurts when I shrug . Yeah , well , I bet wagging your finger at me , old man , will be ... Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , kiddo . Hey . I plan on making your life hell for a very long time . Can I hug you ? Maybe later in the week . Okay . Hey . What are you , putting together some stuff for a shelter ? I 'm leaving . Okay , okay , look , I 'm sorry . I 've been really busy at work . But I found some bones in the garbage today I had to bury ... I know . I know . I know . I 've been wanting to tell you . But ... Okay , I don 't really work at an IRS warehouse . No kidding . All right , just ... Just listen , okay ? The rule is I can tell one person , one really important person ... No . Don 't . I am not the one , Pete . So , please don 't tell me . I don 't want a complicated life . Complicated ? It 's not that complicated . Kelly , it 's way more simple than it looks . Okay , Lizzie Borden 's compact makes you kill the one you love , like she killed her dad . You love me and I love you . It 's simple . It 's just that your life is filled with excitement and danger and just insanity , and it 's all the things that I don 't want . There are quiet days , too . Goodbye , Pete . Stay safe . Hey . What 's up ? I 've been trying to figure out ways to simplify my life , and it all boils down to three words . " Quit your job , Pete . " Four words . Mmm-hmm . I wasn 't counting " Pete . " So , then what ? I don 't know . Get Kelly back . I don 't know . Try and live a normal life . What ? If you had wanted to do that , you would have already left . Look , just because that worked on H. G ... This ... This is the right life for you . It is . You were born for it . And you 're really , really , really good at it . You are . And you need this Warehouse , and this Warehouse 13 needs you . You can 't quit . Yeah . Yeah . All right , I 'm going to go see Artie . You coming ? Um ... Pete , I ... In a bit . Okay . Okay . I understand you wanted to see me . Yeah . Yes . Would you ... Would you give this to Artie , please ? Myka . You can 't blame yourself . It could have happened to any one of us . But it didn 't . It happened to me . You talked her down . You saved us all . It should never have come to that . I put the entire world in jeopardy . I can 't even conceive of that . I just know that I can 't ... I can 't take that chance again . And neither can you . " Artie , it breaks my heart to write this . " We both know the Warehouse is my happiest place . " I have thought a lot about this , and I can 't stay here . " If I do , I 'll second guess myself into oblivion . " Please forgive me , but I have to go . " Pete , you 're the big brother I never had . " I wish I had your strength . " I know I frown at you and punch you a lot , " but I 'll always love you . Please be careful . " Leena , you 're the only mom they have . " Watch over them and make sure that Artie eats right . " Claudia , " take care of Pete and Artie . " Let 's face it , you 're the only real adult in the group . " I wish I could be there to see you " grow into the amazing woman you 're going to become . " I love you all . Myka . "

 I want to see him . Plane 's ready to go . I can handle this , Peter . You don 't have to have any part in it . Yeah , I do . It 's awful . Did the police , you know , say anything ? Engine fire or- - Accident . Tragic accident . I 'm so sorry for your loss . Excuse me . [ Clock chiming ] Aah ! [ Panting ] I tried to stop him . I 'm sorry . Stop who ? Hello , Samuel . [ Doyle gasps ] Sylar . Oh , good . You remembered . Get everyone to safety . But not too far . Understand ? Go . You 're just delaying the inevitable . You could have killed Doyle . You didn 't . I 'll get to him . I 'm much more interested in you . Memories were a little fuzzy , like an orange that 's been left out too long , but I could still find my way back . - Thank you . - My pleasure . Been a while since my body and mind were together . Be a crisis for a lesser man having your soul ripped out of you , but not for me . I returned with one simple , singular thought . I know . Wait , don 't tell me . Fun . Feast . [ Groans ] Love what you 've done with the place . Brought a lot more people in here . Gonna make me a lot more powerful . No , it makes me more powerful . I got big plans for you . Kill me now , you 'll never know what could be . Everybody has big plans for me . I think that 's all people have . [ Wind rumbling ] Hey . You all right ? I , uh , wasn 't expecting to see you . Well , I thought I 'd give you a lift . Oh . You don 't want a ride ? I , uh ... I 'd actually prefer if you didn 't come . You lied to me . Once again . About Nathan 's death , about what you did . God . It was Sylar . Did you ... forget that it was Sylar ? Did you forget what he did to me ? No . He attacked me . He cut open my head . He killed my father . And you , you dressed him up in Nathan 's face , and I hugged him . And I felt love for him . We did the wrong thing for the right reason . We found a way to contain Sylar and to keep Nathan alive at the same time . Claire . It didn 't work . We shouldn 't have done it . You did . And I need time to grieve without being reminded why . I keep looking up too , hoping to see him . We never have been very good with death , have we ? Or it 's complications . Can 't have been easy for you , covering this all up with Noah . How are you ? Okay . I 'm okay , mom . Nathan was a better liar . Must have gotten that from you . I 'm sorry . You don 't deserve that . Oh , sure I do . I deserve every ounce of your wrath . No , you don 't . Just want to put my fist through a wall right now . No , you want to put a fist through Sylar . What do you want , mom ? Don 't do it . Nathan was right . You need to fight the good fight . Revenge will only get you killed . And I cannot bear to lose you too . Claire 's here . Hey . Hey . You , uh , you want to help me in the kitchen ? You trying to escape ? As quickly as possible . Hey , guys , why don 't you take a break ? Thanks . Hey , where 's your dad ? Didn 't see him out there . Uh , I asked him not to come . Ah , you 're pissed . You 're not ? Oh , I am . Good . 'Cause you 're about the only person who 's on the same page as me . That 's a hell of a lie . Trying to protect us . Yeah . That 's fine . I get that , but ... I mean , did they really think that they were gonna get away with it ? Forever ? That we would just never find out ? Ow ! - Damn it ! - Let me see . It 's not healing . I have the Haitian 's power . I 'll , uh ... Sorry , I 'll turn it off . No , don 't , don 't . Let me find you a band-aid . A band-aid . I have not used a band-aid in forever . It 's nice to feel pain . Feel normal . We 're anything but ... normal . Mourning Nathan could not be more ordinary . That 's what we 're here to do . To cut lemons and limes and remember that ... stupid jerk . I can 't believe he 's gone . Oh , I hope he can find heaven , because he was a terrible navigator . I mean , for a guy who could fly . [ Laughs ] Why are you laughing ? What 's so funny ? He gave me endless grief for dating a guy who could fly . He said I had daddy issues , which I do . Whatever happened to that kid ? What was his name ? West . He goes to N.Y.U. We 're facebook friends . It 's nice telling stories . Makes it a little easier . What about about you ? You must have a million of ' em . I 'm gonna take these out there . [ Lock clicks ] [ Air whooshes ] [ Traffic noises ] [ Stun-gun buzzing ] [ Groans ] Won 't get fooled again . Huh ? IHai . Oi , restaurant closed . Everybody get out . Iron Maiden ? Seriously ? Just a little nickname that you earned back in the day . It 's a compliment . What are you doing here , Noah ? Aren 't you supposed to be at Nathan 's wake ? Claire didn 't want me to come . Do you have the sodium thiopental ? You want to talk about this ? There 's just nothing much to talk about . I misled her . She 's angry . I don 't blame her . Maybe if I had followed my gut on this , the whole thing wouldn 't have happened . So the truth serum 's for you ? You 're gonna confess everything to Claire ? Not exactly . Do you remember the speedster down in Miami ? Carlos , the Cuban missile crisis . We couldn 't figure out how to stop him . Well , it turns out that speedsters don 't like the cold . Or Quaaludes . But mostly the cold . Tightens their muscles , slows down their heart , levels the playing field . Meet Edgar . He 's gonna tell me everything he knows about the carnival . Needle ? [ Exhales ] Why did you put Sylar in my trailer ? Because you 're going to help him . He 's not ... Dead ? No . No , he 's amazingly resilient . Muscles knitting back into flesh . But even though all the parts are back into place , there 's something wrong with him . Well , yeah ... No , not that . He had the chance to end me , and he couldn 't . He 's different . Not the cold-blooded killer , not the blank slate . Then what ? That 's what you 're gonna find out . And how we can use that to our advantage . How am I supposed to do that ? With your charming personality . I 'm not some piece of flesh you can just toss around . You didn 't seem to mind the last time he was here . Don 't be petulant . It 's ugly . Everyone has to do their share . I know the rules . If you had strength , I 'd put you in construction . If you had the wisdom , you 'd teach the children , but no . These hands were meant for a softer trade- - Plying out the demons that haunt men 's souls . Don 't disappoint me . Your skin is so soft . It 's like a baby . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna help figure out what 's wrong with you . [ Gasps ] There 's nothing wrong with me . I heard differently . You couldn 't kill Samuel . Let 's find out why . What are you afraid of ? Mm . [ Both breathing heavily ] You 're lonely . You 're afraid you 're gonna die alone , but you want love . You just don 't think that you deserve it . Do you know what I do to people like you ? You cut open our heads . You steal our powers . You ... see what people want . Their desires . Their hopes . I like it . What are the tattoos for ? A map . How to find what you need . [ Gasping for air ] You don 't want to help me . You want to manipulate me to your agenda to kill Samuel . I see what you want . I got your power . I don 't need to kill . That 's just something I like to do . Not anymore . You 're impotent . I tried to find a photo of you , but ... There are none . Not of the illegitimate daughter . Nathan wanted to acknowledge you , but you convinced him that it would tarnish his career . I know . I 've heard the story . You 're angry . I 'm disappointed . In you and my dad . I 'm supposed to look up to my elders , yet I can 't believe a word that comes out of either one of your mouths . Well , I can 't blame you , Claire , but you do have a good head on your shoulders . You 've grown into a fine young woman . It 's Peter I 'm worried about . Wow . That I actually do believe . He 's empathetic beyond his years , but now it 's his time to grieve , and he has absolutely no idea how to go about it . He needs a shoulder to lean on . Yours . You 're his mother . I am . But , like you , I 'm afraid he will never trust me again . He 'll listen to you , Claire . He 's up on the roof , listening to that police scanner and looking for justice . Please help him . Go ahead , 55 . We have a 10.3 at 1583 West Hudson . Repeat . A 10.3 at 1583 West Hudson . I have a barricaded suspect with hostages . Shots fired . No sign of suspect . All units hold back . I 'm alone in here , and I don 't want to execute . 55 standing by . In position outside south corridor . No sign of suspect or hostages . Waiting ... [ Gun clatters ] I need you to keep breathing . Just breathe . [ Door closes ] Claire ? What are you doin ' here ? I followed you . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Claire . I 'm helping . And so are you . Come here . Give me your hand . Put it right on that . Right there . Don 't move . Claire , this is Wendy . - Hey . - Hi . Don 't worry about the blood . Just keep the pressure on , okay ? And don 't move . Wendy , what 'd you say this guy 's name was ? Uh , Adam Malamut . He got fired , and then he ... He just went crazy . Just relax . I 'll take care of it . Peter , you can 't do this . It 's a little late for that . Peter , wait . Why are you doing this ? Because I need to be more than a band-aid , Claire . [ Gunshots ] Wait ! I 'm the one who can 't get hurt by bullets ! Just take a deep breath , in through your nose , out through your mouth . Try to stay calm . Where 's Samuel ? What 's he planning ? What does he want with Claire ? I don 't know . I swear . Nice weight . Good balance . Sharp as hell . You make this yourself ? Oh , this is fine work . I 'm impressed . Hey , is this the knife that cut me ? Yeah . Yeah . Let 's start again . Where 's Samuel ? Noah , can I talk to you ? Look , I get that you 're angry . This guy sliced you up like this albacore . That 's Toro . And this has nothing to do with revenge . You sure ? Because his face looks an awful lot like revenge . I just want some answers . I know you do , but I can tell you that torture doesn 't work . Look , I might have been the iron maiden back in the day , but I have changed , and you may think that I 'm shoving my liberal agenda down your throat , but you are losing your target . You 're emotional . I 'm not emotional . I just- - Worried about Claire ? What Samuel 's done to her , said to her , and these medieval tactics aren 't getting you anywhere with either of them . Thanks for the sodium thiopental . Stop using him as a punching bag , and start talking to him . There 's a story you 're not getting here . Try to be objective , look at the facts of the situation . He doesn 't have a compass . Why doesn 't he have a compass ? Honey tastes sweeter than vinegar . I promise . Who the hell are you ? Don 't worry about her . There you go . You just keep that gun pointed right at me . - You work here ? - No . I 'm just like you . Having a bad day . The worst , in fact . You see , I just buried my brother . He was murdered . And if that 's not bad enough , I had to stage his death . Like I 'm some kind of mobster or spy , but I 'm not . I 'm just some kid from New York City . And now everyone expects me to shake hands and pretend like everything 's normal , but it 's not . It 's far from that . Why are you telling me this , man ? Because I understand where you 're at right now . You want to punish the people that have hurt you . I know what that feels like . I want to torture the guy that murdered my brother . I want to make him scream . That 's all I can think about . But I 'm trying to be hopeful . I 'm trying to be strong , even though I feel myself slipping . Look , I promised my brother that I 'd be a hero . Don 't make me a liar . Not today . [ Gunshot ] [ siren wailing ] That hurts every time . Well , it 's supposed to . That 's what happens when you take a bullet . I thought I 'd get to him first . I did take him down , though . Yep . You saved the day . It 's your turn now , Claire . Come on . Help me out . I don 't think that 's gonna solve anything , is it ? What are you talking about ? Quit messing around . I 'm messing around ? What about you , huh ? Running into danger ? Going off after Sylar ? You 're not gonna do anything but get yourself in trouble . You have got to stop . No . You have to . I can 't . [ Exhales ] I 'm not always gonna be here to be your personal safety net . [ Buckle clicks ] Then I guess this is a good ability to hang on to . And even if you do , then what ? Huh ? What kind of life is this ? A human pin cushion ? If I keep moving ? If I ... Just act on instinct , then I don 't have time to think . About Nathan ? Nathan would be so pissed at you right now . Lying to yourself , lying to us . You 're not honoring his memory . You 're avoiding it . If I think about it , then it 's real . If I mourn , then it 's real . I miss him . I know . Me too . You like tea ? Stupid question . You 're British . Here . Drink up . You must be freezing . Thought the skirt was the good cop . Oh , the skirt is the good cop . Trust me . This is her idea , the two of us talking . If it were up to me , You 'd be down six fingers by now . I spotted you as I came out of my daughter 's dorm . I figure your top speed is somewhere between 600 , 700 miles an hour ? More ? You could have killed me at any time , flew past , gutted me ... Blink of an eye . But you want me alive . You need me for something . What is it ? You don 't have a compass . You can 't get home . What are you doing out here ? Exiled . What did you do ? Found out that Sammy killed his brother , Joseph . He convinced the lot it was my fault . And they just believed him on his say so ? What 's he planning ? What 's he gonna do with them ? Is he recruiting more ? I don 't know . Sammy 's all about saber rattling . He ordered me to kill Danko . To slice up your gut . Sorry about that . You don 't seem like a hitman to me . I 'm a juggler . Joseph taught me . Called it the most useful skill a man needs . A juggler ? If you can keep a chainsaw , knife , and torch in the air , you can balance anything . But you 're all out of balance . You 're exiled . You 're lost . Why did you attack me ? Thought if I caught the boogie man and brought you back to Samuel , He 'd take me back . You 'd go back to Samuel even after he killed your friend and blamed it on you ? I 'm afraid of what he 's gonna do to my friends . Where he 's gonna lead my family . That makes two of us . We can help each other here , Edgar . Enemy of my enemy makes us ... less antagonistic . We could stop Samuel together before he has a chance to hurt the people we love the most . You think that tea 's gone cold ? [ Jar shatters ] Fresh out of ink . You destroyed the last batch . Then make more . You want a tattoo ? You want to find out where you 're supposed to go next ? I say you 're already here . I don 't think so . I know why you can 't kill . Lydia told my everything . I doubt she told you everything . You think people are lying , manipulative bastards . They 're just trying to con you . Aren 't you ? You 're hurting . You need a friend . Even though I tried to kill you ? Especially because you tried to kill me . You 're not special . You 're like everyone else . We all need people who understand us . Care for us . Who 's she ? Vanessa . The love of my life . I 'd move mountains for her If she 'd ask me . Haven 't seen her around here . No . She 's out there . I 'm afraid she 'll reject me . For who I am , for what I 've done . That 's the way you think too , that no one could love you . Stop pretending like you know who I am . You have no idea . I know Hiro Nakamura said you 're going to die alone and it 's haunting you . I know you . I am you . I 'm not a good guy . But I 'm not all bad , either . I found love and forgiveness and acceptance right here , and you can too . If that 's true , let the tattoo show me , and I 'll stay . What ? You afraid I might see something else ? I 'm a carny . I live for games of chance . You sure we should have him up here ? Trust begets trust . [ Slurps ] Never had miso soup before . It 's good . Thank you . No , thank you , Edgar . This is invaluable . Now we know what we 're up against . The problem , of course , is finding it . Claire has a compass . - No . - I 'm just saying . I 'm not putting her in the middle of this . You must have a way to get back in . Lydia . She has no great love for Samuel . Good . Good . Okay . We 're gonna isolate Samuel here , in this backstage area . Quick and targeted . And nobody else gets hurt , right ? Ideally . We 're gonna do everything we can , but this is a raid . When it 's over , I promise you , we will take care of everybody . We 'll find them all homes . They 've got a home . The carnival 's our home . Samuel 's the problem . If they 're wrapped around his finger , he 's gonna use them to protect himself . They 're lambs . They know no better . He 's brainwashed them , Edgar . Look what he did to you . He turned you from a juggler into an assassin . Even if we stopped Samuel , can you promise me that somebody else won 't just take his place ? I know that you think of this as a family , but it has a lot more in common with a cult . Your friends need help . They need to be left alone . Left alone out in the open makes them targets . I have never seen that end well . But by separating them , by reintegrating them into the real world , we can make sure that this doesn 't happen again . [ Handcuffs click ] What are you doing , Edgar ? It was a mistake coming here , trusting you . I won 't let you hurt my family . Okay , Edgar , just slow down . You 're not a violent person . No . You are . What 's it doing ? Stop thinking . Stop trying to force it . Just let it happen . Well , isn 't that interesting . I guess you were wrong . I don 't belong here . I like it better up here than down there . I have a love-hate relationship with rooftops . You gonna go back tonight ? Yeah . We got school tomorrow . Unless you want me to stay , which I can . No , I 'm cool . Yeah ? Yeah . I 'm fine . 'Cause I 've got to trust you . Can 't have you lying to me . Not you . I 'll always be honest with you . I promise . Strange request . Um , your old boyfriend . West . Could you ... call him for me ? Yeah . Why ? We had everything we needed to end this , and I blew it . You 're being hard on yourself . I thought the expression was " too hard " on yourself . No , no , I said it right . Still think honey tastes sweet ? I still think it was the right move , yes . Look , I 've seen this before with other cult leaders . Samuel has done a number on Edgar . He 's got his hooks in all of them . You mean Claire . Yeah , I mean Claire . You 're still her father . You 're the only one she has left , and she needs you . You know the thing about burned bridges is ... they can be rebuilt . Vanessa . [ Breaking adhesive tape ] " In the library studying late . Gretchen . " Great .

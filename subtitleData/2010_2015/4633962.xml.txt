 Previously on Continuum . Who 's been in charge in my absence ? I have . Yo , step-bro . All right , then . Are you lost ? My family used to live there . Well , we live here now . I 'm a guy with a bad future ready for a fresh start . We 're getting information Liberate has three possible bombing targets . What type of device ? Unknown . It 's electronic signature is cloaked . We 'll be using eyes and ears . Check your weapons and lock down your gear . This is going to be one hell of a ride . Kiera ? Greg , are you still with Mr. Sadler ? He 's just about to speak . Why ? CPS just got word that Liberate is getting hit after a high value target . I am worried SadTech could be it . There 's no way they 'll ever get in here Greg ? The CPS just declared martial law . Liberate terrorists got inside the safe zone . Hit a SadTech warehouse . Greg ? Oh God ! Greg please ! Hang on people ! Hang on ! Travis has them assembled . Thank you Sonya ! Your loyalty to Travis is inspiring to me . Thank you . You could be forgiven otherwise . My loyalty to Travis is second only to mine for you and to our cause . I will be in shortly . What are your orders , Edouard ? Due to the Protector 's presence here , it seems our plan needs altering . By about 60 years . Our goals are still the same . The Corporate Congress may not yet exist , but its seeds have been planted . We will ensure it never grows . We will do this by inspiring a new generation to take up our cause and undermine the very foundations set the Congress will be built on . But we will not do this By open confrontation . We are still at war ... A war we will never win unless we fight it on the enemy 's terms . We don 't need guns to transform this world ... We have the knowledge of what will happen and the power to imagine better . You are a good soldier . In my absence you did what you thought was best . You kept our people together and most of them alive . But now ... From this point forward , instead of force to win our battles , we use strategy and knowledge . How do we begin ? By securing our position . Attack the Protector ? Attack her we will . But not the way she will expect it . Lily Jones ? Is the Protector in sight ? Tell me you have the girl . Yes . Good . Hurry . It 's done . I 'm on the move . No change . 2077 , my time , my city , my family . When terrorists killed thousands of innocents , they were condemned to die . They had other plans . A time travel device sent us all back 65 years . I want to get home . But I can 't be sure what I 'll return to if history is changed . Their plan : to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future . What they didn 't plan on was me ! Hey , good morning . Morning Carlos . Do you something different to your hair ? Nope . Something 's different about you . Same as yesterday . Actually , Carlos is right . Don 't you start . Excuse me . Alec , explain yourself ? - Ah , jeez . - Alec ? I , I can 't talk . I 've got a malfunction here , serious malfunction - Alec . What I mean is , ever since your suit went on the Fritz you 've been acting , well ... I don 't know . Different ? I have ? Turning off your HUD . Trusting your gut . Very un-future cop . Maybe Carlos and I should meet and compare notes ... Even one phone call and you are dead man . Understood . No contancting Carlos . I can see that . Lily Jones . Age twenty . Too young to die . Look at the estimated time of death . Yeah , 9 : 30 . What 's up ? What 's the significance ? Garza was shadowing me at that time . Garza was shadowing you and this is the first I 'm hearing of it . Now you want a ride . You know what ? You 're right . Nothing has changed ! I 'm complicated . Ya think ? Good morning ? Thanks for holding the body for us . What have we got ? Her C2 is subluxated from C3 . Someone very powerful did this . Should take a look at the bruising around her mouth and chin . How powerful ? I 'm speculating she was grabbed by the throat , like so . And lifted off her feet . Straight up , with one hand . Then dumped here . Credit cards and money still in the wallet . So it 's not a robbery . Or someone interrupted them . No track marks if that 's what you 're looking for . There were no witnesses ? Canvas turned up a homeless guy who may or may not have seen a large man exit the alley . Or Big Foot . What about this camera up here ? Anything from there ? Owner says it 's just a prop to scare off the bad guys . That seemed to have work well . See if we could round up any of the feeds from cameras that have coverage of this area . That kind of brute force fits the description of Travis . I 'm assuming that 's why we 're here because you had a lead that this could be connected to our gang ? Lily Jones is the name of a witness , in a case that Section Six was building against Liberate . The case fell apart . She recanted and when pressed to testify , she ran . She just disappeared ? Yeah . Her identity was kept a secret and her files were sealed . So you 're actually checking for identifying marks over there . My Lily has a butterfly tattoo on the inside of her wrist . Wait , what , your Lily ? Are you actually know her ? No . Of her , we never met . Okay , so this is either a robbery gone wrong or is just the tip of an iceberg ? I should call in my people , get an assessment . I 'll have units re-canvas the area and see what we can come up with from footage of the cameras . Thanks . Was that true what you just said about Lily Jones ? I mean , I know it wasn 't . But you had me convinced . What 's going on ? Lily Jones is my grandmother 's name . They 're targeting my family . Travis , someone 's at the door . I 'm back ! Get in here ! How 'd you find us , Kellog ? I have an appointment . I like the new digs . I can 't believe you 're still alive . Seems reports of my death were exaggerated . That 's Twain . Great writer . He 's got this one about a Connecticut Yankee ... Anyway , I bear gifts . I figured you haven 't had time to discover all the wonders of this generation ... All kinds of fruit , juicy , succulent . You guys have to try these oranges . They 're amazing . What are you doing here , Kellog ? I just come by to say , 'no hard feelings ' about leaving me to die with a bomb strapped to my jewels , Travis . Is this true ? He 's a deserter . Regardless . We don 't ever take arms against one of our own . Ever . I understand . You 've chosen your own path . Travis , continue on the endeavor we have begun . That will allow Matthew and I time to speak . Did you steal this ? Nothing so crass . With just a little memory recall , I was able to turn a small fortune in the market . I want anything to do with your money Matthew . Of course not . But in terms of funding a full revolution , it 's a pretty good start , don 't you think ? So , now that we 're back on the right foot , where do we start ? We ? While you were satisfying your appetites , I 've been considering a more critical problem ... This girl may not have been my grandmother , but if the gang is looking for Lily Jones ' , it 's only a matter of time before they find the right one . What , you don 't know your own grandmother ? Look . You know everything about me , I hardly know anything about you . Do you think that 's fair ? She died in her fifties when I was only four . So do you think this could be a coincidence ? Or are they really targeting you through your family . I wish I knew . I gotta go . Betty is tracking down all the Lily Jones ' in the area . Should have word back soon . Ready to go ? I 'll have to catch up . Have you found a solution ? Yes , this is a DNA testing kit we can use to be definite about the results . Lucas will modify it to be instantaneous . But we 'll need an original tissue sample for a baseline . I 'll get it . No . Sonya will go . Take Gaza , get what you need . What ? No hello ? Last time we met here you were holding a live grenade . Then , we were almost blown up by a mine . So forgive me for not beeing polite . I 'm exciting to be around , what can I say ? So this is a Kevlar optional affair ? For you . Not for your ancestors . I just met with Kagame . The danger is real . They 're going after your grandmother . I already know that . Why ? Well , to get rid of you for starters . And it 's all your fault . You had to threat Lucas with killing his grandparents . It got them all going about what might happen if one of our ancestors were killed . And now Kagame , he want to try a grand experiment to test our paradoxical vulnerability . Cupcake ? So that makes me what ... Guinea pig ? Squeak squeak ... How 'd they even know my grandmother 's name ? Kagame , he has his ways . Why would he have that information about my family ? Hell if I know . Look , I don 't know all the details about how our escape was arranged , but I do know that the guards were in on it . Who knows how high the conspiracy went ? Maybe whoever arranged it , told him . Are you telling me that I might be here for a reason ? Part of a bigger plan ? Given what happened , does anything seem too far fetched to you ? If you think I have ulterior motives , join me on my yacht tonight ? How about lunch ? Deal . Thanks for the lunch . You can pick up the check . Carlos . Yeah , look , I just spoke with my contacts in Section 6 . They confirmed that the gang are going after our witness and that she 's here , in town . But they killed the wrong girl . And they just keep going until they find the right one . So now we round up all the Lily Jones ' in the lower mainland and place them in protective custody . Here you go sir . So , we 've get it done ? - We don 't have a choice . - Thanks . Ahh ! Hey ! Hey ! Sorry I 'm late ! Where 's ... What the hell happened to you ? Uh , bike messenger . I 've just ... stepped out , didn 't see him . You Ok ? What have you got ? I had Samantha look at all the Lily Jones 's that fit the age range . There 's eight of them , nine if you count the dead girl . We 've got their addresses . I 've sent units to their homes , but it 's daytime ... some may be at work or school . We 've got leads . We can cover more ground if we split up . That 's a good idea . I 'll requisition you a cruiser . Thanks ! They 're like drones , blissfully unaware they 're being trained into subservience . Those that seek truth will find it . This has been programed with the Protector 's DNA . You can use it to match with the girls ' . You think she 's going to just sit there while I perform your test ? Then kill her first . That 's not what Kagame wants . Why are you so sure one of the Lily 's is here ? I just know . You looked her up before , didn 't you ? You Googled your grandmother . I knew she lived here for a while . I looked up the names and some data . This woman , she 's exactly like my mom said she was . She 's smart , she 's intelligent she 's involved in the community . You 've been stalking her . Maybe . What are you going do ? Just walk up her , said " Helloooo , I 'm your future granddaughter ? " Wait , here she is . Gotta go ! There you are ! There I am . Lillian Jones ? I 'm Detective Kiera Cameron . May I have a moment ? See ya later . Ms. Jones , your life is in danger . Dad 's waiting for us , let 's go . Yeah , about that , um ... I have to take a pass on the meeting tonight . I 'm in the middle of something big . What , you think Dad isn 't ? Honestly ? What Roland is doing gives me the creeps . So , if you 'll excuse me I have more important things to do than sitting around with a bunch of conspiracy freaks wearing tin foil hats . Whoa ! Wait ! You 're always going on about how important ... whatever it is you do is . Like you 're changing the frickin ' world or something . How ' bout spending some time with your family ? You 're not my family . And this grass roots activism of yours isn 't changing the world . It 's a joke . You want to change the world ? You have to leave your living room first . We may not be a real family , Alec . But we 're the closest thing you 've got . You said terrorists are killing women with my name , and you can 't give me specifics ? No . I think I 'm going to lose it . Try to stay calm . What would I do ? I 'm going to take you into custody , get you somewhere safe ... Okay . Excuse me , I 've got to take this . Cameron . Hey , I just got a word that a Lily Jones was involved in an incident . Incident ? An assault of some kind . Details are sketchy . Where ? Broadway and Granville . They 've got the assailant , too . Tell them to use extreme caution . Way ahead of you . I 'm leaving the precinct now . You go and get Lily and I 'll deal with the assailant . You 're at one of the best universities in the country . Your parents must be very proud . They are . They wouldn 't be named Jim and Alison by any chance , would they ? No . Kevin and Eve . Miss Jones . I need you to come with ... Is this a joke ? This is the victim . That 's Lily Jones . Let go ! Get me the hell out of of here ! You may want to get a tetanus shot . Thanks . Are you done eyeing me up ? Are your parents ' names Jim and Alison ? Did they send you get me ? Because I 'm not going and you can 't make me . I 'm emancipated . And that girl owed me money . I was just trying to collect . I don 't owe you anything you delinquent . You can 't arrest me for a misunderstanding ! I 'm not arresting you . Then let me go . No , you need to come with me . Your life is in danger . I get it . Oh , you 're here to help . Clean up the street kids . Don 't bother I 've never done anything more than smoke a joint . This just gets better . Who 's the chick ? There is a terrorist group killing women named Lily Jones . You 're Lily Jones . She 's Lily Jones . I 'm taking both of you to the station for protection . You said you weren 't going to arrest me ! I 'm not . Relax ! I guess we 're in a unique club . Not every day you get chased by a terrorist , - It 's very Terminator ... - Shut up . I like your necklace . Is it a butterfly . Blah , blah , blah ... Hey . I 'm just making the best of a bad situation . You wouldn 't know a bad situation if it bit you on your Dolce Gabbanas . I 'd rather take my chances against terrorists than sit here listening to her . Just let me out anywhere . Not until you 're both safe . How do I know you 're not the danger ? Your badge might be fake . You could be some psycho kidnapping us . Let go ! Let me go ! Just take me , bitch . One Lily Jones is dead already . I am trying to prevent that from happening again . Are we clear ? ! Everything is going to be fine . Okay ? I promise . Oh God . Roll down the window . I 'm not going to let you out until we get to the Precinct . I 'm gonna puke . Not on my purse ! Open the window . That 's much better . Do you have a weird taste in your mouth ? Kind of sucking on a nail ? Yeah . How 'd you know ? I had that when I was pregnant . I 'm only a couple of days late . Okay . We need to get you to a ... Are you guys okay ? Are you okay ? We gotta get out of the car ! Get down . Came here . Pull her out , pull her out ! Stay down . Stay down , stay down , stay low ! Stay down ! Go that way , behind the car ! Where 's my back up ! Carlos is on route ! Hang tight . Kiera can you hear me ? Stay down , get down ! Kiera , are you okay ? You okay ? Yeah . Are you okay ? Are you sure we 're safe ? Carlos took the other Lily to the station . We 're going someplace safer . I think you missed a few brands back there . Have friends much ? What do you mean by that ? You 're all like " do this " , " do that " , " get in the car cuz someone 's trying to kill you . " Kind of Bossy . Look who 's talking . Yeah . But I 'm the kid . I 'm supposed to be this way . You 're the adult . You 're supposed to be nice . Get in the car . Please . Why aren 't you using your CMR ? Because I 'm with company . I need you to track some people down for me You 're a mind reader . Kellog , I need you to be on call . I will have her gassed up and ready to go in one hour . I have to pee . Thank you . I just figured they would be looking for us everywhere , airports , bus terminals , train stations ... Us ? My ... " relative " and I. You found her ? Okay . For this I 'll expect nothing in return . We can save that romantic Harbor cruise for another ... Yeah . Matthew ... I understand you 've been a busy little bee . Flitting about , pollinating . And straying into things you shouldn 't . And now , someone has to pay the price . Mister Kellog , what 's going on ... why did these people take me ? Mattie , Mattie .. Are we clear ? What 's this all about ? Lily ... How you doing in there ? I 've got 6 more seconds . False positives happen all the time , right ? How are you feeling ? Scared . That 's understandable . Are you kidding me ? This is a frickin nightmare . I 'm not old enough to have a kid ! I 'm 17 ! What are you looking at ? Nothing . I just ... This is horrible . My life is ruined . Lily ? It 's a boy . I 'm gonna call the clinic . I think it 's 1400 life credits or something . Is that what you want ? I just thought given that we ... I was going to give this to you on your birthday next week . But considering the circumstances ... Will you marry me ? Yes . Lily ... having a baby doesn 't mean giving up your dreams , A child adds to them . You don 't get it . I don 't have dreams . I don 't have a job . I don 't have a regular place to crash . I never even finished High School ! I 'm just going to get rid of it . Before you go there . Think this out . Talk with the father ... Jake ? That 's a great idea . As soon as I tell Jake , he 's gonna ditch my ass . Lily ... For all you know , he 'll love this baby . Most people goes their whole lives thinking they know what the future holds for them . They 've got a fantasy of how the world is . But sometimes , you 're going through your day and BANG , there 's an explosion and everything you know is gone . And it makes you wish you 'd done things differently ... You get that ? What ! They took her . Took who ? Mattie . My grandmother . They found out that I tipped you . And now they 're going to use me to get to you . Get to me how ? They want a trade . Mattie , for Lily . I 'm not good with this , but I 'm getting enough . Bye bye . So , that 's it , I 'm free ? Still got to get ... Wait a minute ... You sure the girl is safe here ? We read how the precinct was attacked . Betty ! How do we know ... Because our security systems have been upgraded , we 're equipped for anything . I still haven 't heard a sufficient plan of how you ... Please , please , just talk to Betty . She 'll take care of everything . I gotta take this . Good luck ! Hey ! This is how it 's going to be . Whoa ! Hey , where are you ? I 've got a precinct full of Lily 's and their parents here . It 's like herding cats . I 'm with my Lily . Dillon 's breathing down my neck . He wants to know what Section Six wants done with these girls . I don 't have any news . Oh , that 's ... that 's great . But I do have someone else I need you to track down . Please tell me it 's not another Lily ? Not exactly . I 'll text you the name . Everything 's okay ? I still haven 't changed my mind . When I found out that I was pregnant I didn 't think I was ready either . I was fresh out of the military and starting a new career . Having a child was the last thing on my mind . What happened ? I told my boyfriend . And you 're still together ? Married . So are you going to tell me why I 've been rammed into , chased and shot at ? That 's complicated . I 'm not going to do this . I 'm by myself . I don 't even have family . You don 't have to . This little girl is the opportunity for you to start a family of your own . And one day she will grow up and have a daughter of her own and you will find yourself surrounded by so much love , you 'll wonder how you ever got so lucky . How do you know I 'm going to have a girl ? Just a hunch . Lily , I 'm going to ask you to do something dangerous . I need you to trust me . Yes , okay . He 's ready . Say what you will about Kellog . He 's very resourceful . You know , I could get suspended for pulling a stupid stunt like this . I 'll take the heat if anything goes sideways . Damn straight you will . Promise me you 'll think about telling Jake ? He may surprise you . That 's if we make it out of here alive . We will . We have to . We 're good ? We 're good . Is that her ? Send Mattie over . First you send over the girl . Change of plans . That 's not her grandmother . No ... That 's my mother . She 's pregnant . Yes , with me . Gaza , give him what he wants . Let 's go . They won 't hurt you . You okay ? Hey ! I 'm not good with this , but I 'm good enough . Bye-bye . So that 's it ? I 'm free ? We 've still got to get ... Wait a minute . Get down , get down . No ! No , no ! Call 911 . It 's going to be okay . Oh , God ! Stay with me , stay with me ! It 's going to be okay . I 've got an ambulance on the way . Ambulance is coming . Don 't die , don 't die , don 't die ... Stay with me , stay with me ! You 're still alive . You think I care about that ? The ambulance is on it 's way ... It 's okay . Kiera ! Sam ! Dad ! Where were you ! ? Sadler changed the location of our meeting at the last minute . He wouldn 't let me tell you for security reasons . We left SadTech 20 minutes before the blast . Then I tried to call but all communications were down ... Don 't you ever disappear like that again . If I ever lost you ... Jake can do his graphic design anywhere , so as long as this new place has got Internet access ... You take care of her . Bye . Thank you , Kellog . I appreciate this . See you soon . Kellog is going to cash in this favour . I can handle Kellog . The bullet that killed Mattie , according to Kagame 's experiment , it should have killed Kellog also . Why didn 't it ? That 's precisely the problem . If Kellog had died or disappeared after Mattie was killed , then we would have definitive proof that this timeline is connected to the one you left . So what does this prove ? Unfortunately nothing . Maybe Mattie wasn 't Kellog 's biological grandmother . Maybe you are on a new time line or maybe you aren 't and there is no paradox ... I really don 't know ... The absence of proof is not proof of anything . Hopefully Kagame now believes they can 't get to me through my family . That 's one less thing to worry about . I gave my word . My word ! You behave like a mad dog , and I will put you down . ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ Mom ! I found the necklace . It was under your bed . Thank you sweetie . It 's really old , isn 't it ? Yes . My Grandma gave it to me when I was a little girl . ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ Edouard : Every game needs its pawns . Ready to make a change , Julian ? They share our anger . It just needs to be cultivated . Why would you draw this much attention ? Maybe attention is what they wanted . The revolution starts here .

 Previously on Fringe ... An unstable wormhole has quarantined by Fringe Division citizens in case of Quarantine Amber have been ruled legally dead . This is gonna sound nuts ... When she was having her breakdown she kept on and on about how they were trying to make her believe she was somebody else . What if she 's telling the truth ? What if it 's not the real her ? That is nuts . You 're right . How does she seem ? Like Olivia Dunham . For all intents and purposes , she is Agent Dunham . You 're not from this world , Olivia . You 're not real . Real is just a matter of perception . And I 'm a part of you that you have to hold on to . You can 't forget who you are , Olivia . You 've been back with fringe division for a week now ? Uh ... For eight days . Any headaches or lingering symptoms ... Mood swings , insomnia ? No . Although I do feel like I keep getting asked the same question Over and over again . Is that a lingering symptom ? You are recovering from a severe mental break , Agent Dunham ... I have to ask you these questions . Yeah . I know . Please accept my apologies For the poking and prodding , Agent Dunham . Uh , Mr. Secretary . You look well . I am . Good as new . Did you get the dossier I sent over ? Yes , sir . So you really believe That the other Olivia Dunham can cross between universes . It would appear so . Thus far , we 've developed some means of our own , But each of them has dangerous side effects . But it seems their Olivia can travel between worlds safely , Which is the real reason you 're here today . We believe you may be able to do the same . How would I be able to do that ? I don 't know ... Yet . But with your permission , We 'd like to put you through a series of experiments To see if we 're right . I 'm sure you understand ... What this would mean to our cause . We 'd be able to defend ourselves against the other side . But ... I know you 've been through a lot , Olivia . So if you 're not up to it , you should just say so . You can take as many pills as you want . I 'm not going anywhere . You 're not here . Look , I understand why you agreed To take the test . You just want things to go back to normal , To be the Olivia that you think you should be , But unfortunately , that 's not gonna happen . Because you 're not their Olivia . And you can keep on telling yourself that you 're fine , But you 're not fine . You 're not sleeping . And I 'm not a lingering symptom . You can 't ignore me . All right , easy . Got it ? Yep . Careful . I said careful ! Have your gun ? Okay , ready ? I got it . I got it . He 's not breathing . He 's dead . No , he 's not dead . Gimme ... gimme the syringe . Gimme the syringe ! Come on , buddy , come on . Come on , come on , come on . Nothing . Come on ! Come on ! Warning . Quarantine area breach . The cops are gonna be here any minute . We gotta move . Breathe ! Come on , breathe ! Come on ! Okay , you 're okay . Cut him out , cut him out ! You okay ? yeah ... Okay , give me a minute . We 're gonna cut you out , okay ? Come on , pick it up ! Wilner . Wilner ! Oh , God . Here . Pull . Come on , come on , pull . Just pull . Come on ! Pull , come on , pull ! Come on , man , come on , come on , pull ! Help me . Please ! Wilner , I 'm sorry . He 's my brother . No ! Please ! Don 't leave me ! Homemade laser knife . It 's clean . There 's no fingerprints . Pretty sophisticated tech for looters . Well , you gotta hand it to ' em . No one 's ever removed anything from the quarantine zone , Yet they keep trying . Lotta purses and wallets in there . Like Cary grant said ... " the stuff that dreams are made of . " You got something ? I don 't know yet . I 'll be right back . Hey . Well , look who 's here . Yeah . Traffic . Third time this week . You gotta stop taking the Nixon parkway . Yeah . You okay ? You seem a little run down . Oh , yeah . Frank 's on assignment , And I never sleep very well when he 's away . So you gonna bring me up to speed ? In 1989 , these isolated tears in the fabric of our universe Began to increase in frequency . Some of them expanded into micro black holes With devastating consequences . To contain these events , Scientists designed a quarantine protocol Using a chemical substance , Amber 31422 . All right , just fast forward . What are you looking for ? I was just watching this a couple of weeks ago . I just ... Remember something a little differently . Right there . Freeze it . Thanks . Four years ago , this station was sealed . Now it looks like we have a new addition . Meet our thief . Must have gotten caught in the reseal . Mark Wilmer . Couple counts of burglary . You know , breaking into Amber Seems awfully ambitious for a small-time crook . Something tells me he wasn 't after purses . So this is where the powerful hide out . Just those that need to do some thinking Before they head home . Thank you for meeting me . Understand you 're working on a case ... A man removed from Amber . Franklin street station . We 're trying to determine why someone Would go to all that trouble to steal him . When I first ... Developed the Amber , The universe was degrading at an alarming rate . People were becoming afraid to leave their homes . I remember the first time we instigated the protocol . It was ... October 17 , 1989 . I remember I woke ... Particularly happy that day . And then there was the breach at Harvard yard . If we hadn 't contained it , Half of Boston would have been swallowed up . 63 civilians were trapped in Amber that day ... And all the hundreds since . It sickens me . Sir ... It 's a tragic , but a small price to pay For the greater good . People understand that . Perhaps . But if they were to find out That the Amber victims could be removed and resuscitated , I 'm afraid the outcry would be akin to revolt . Quarantine victims are alive ? Theoretically . But to remove them Would weaken the structural integrity of the Amber . We 'll recover them before anyone finds out , sir . Oh , and another thing . Olivia Dunham has agreed to submit to the tests Developed by science division . As I 've said , these ... Tests are stressful . If she becomes unstable in any way ... If I see any unusual behavior , I 'll let you know . Nature doesn 't recognize good and evil , Phillip . Nature only recognizes balance and imbalance . I intend to restore balance to our world . Whatever it takes . Really ? You never did that before ? Make my own Popsicles ? Yeah . Aw . My mom used to have these plastic molds , And you 'd pour fruit juice into them And then stick them in the freezer . My mom ... Made me get her cigarettes . Aw ! Aw ! Ah . So who 's the Popsicle ? Joshua rose . I worked his case with fringe division Four years ago . He 's a bank robber . Well , why would fringe division Be appointed to investigate a robber ? Rose used some kind of device That allowed him to access the vaults Without setting off the bank alarms . But what it also did was cause molecular degradation . Man-made breaches . We studied that case back at the academy . You guys had to quarantine what ... half a dozen areas ? One very every job rose pulled . The bank above Franklin station Was rose 's last job . He got caught in the quarantine . Now , it 's possible that he was taken out In order to be revived . Revived ? What I 'm about to tell you is classified . The people entombed in Amber Are in a state of suspended animation . Sir . If people knew that their loved ones Were still alive in there ... I understand , Agent Dunham . Which is why we need to recover rose , Whatever state he 's in , as soon as possible . He had an apartment that was sealed After he was ambered . Start there . Shh , shh , shh . Just rest . You 'll be fine . Just needs time to recover , Danielle . My first partner got caught In an Amber quarantine in Boston . His little girl just turned six last week . If I get ambered ... Just leave me in there . Does that feel familiar ? Two people who look exactly alike . You find anything ? What do we know about rose 's family ? Never married . No kids . Parents are dead . He has a brother Matthew , an accountant . Broyles said he was very cooperative In their investigation . Okay . Uh , maybe we should talk to him again . Hey , guys . Jackpot . Anybody recognize any of this stuff ? Some of it . Ion lasers . Pneumo drills . Some kinda gas . Looks like he was trying to build Some kind of negative matter ring . Okay , Mr. Wizard . Some of us don 't have a fancy degree . Creates high frequency vibrations . Which could weaken the atomic structure Of the bank 's walls . That would explain how rose was able to get inside . He walked through walls ? It 's possible . Okay , now I know you pulled that outta your ass . Listen . Go ! Now ! This might sting a bit . Okay . Dinner is on me tonight , Liv . Evvia , Pimlico . Whatever you want . Big spender . What 's the occasion ? Olivia saved our lives . She heard the bomb before it went off , And we had enough time to get out the apartment . Good work , Agent . Thank you , sir . You I.D. The the symbol on those tanks ? Ferrocene . It 's a compound used in negative matter rings . Oh ho ! What did I say ? Anyone ever tell you gloating isn 't attractive ? Hold still , Agent Francis . That looks pretty bad . Why don 't you take this off ? I 'll get the doctor . Okay . Liv ? Soon as we 're done , We 're gonna go talk to Joshua rose 's brother . Okay . You got it ? I 'll be right back , all right ? I 'll be right back . Matthew rose ? Yeah . What can I do for you ? Agent Lee , fringe division . This is Agent Dunham . What 's goin ' on ? What we 're about to ask you is classified . It 's about your brother Joshua ... Any idea about his whereabouts ? You know , four years ago you people told me That he was trapped in Amber . You telling me you were wrong ? We can 't go into detail . But if we were wrong , would he contact you ? My ... my brother ... Ripped families apart , okay ? Mothers and husbands trapped in Amber Because of the crimes he committed . He 'd know better than to contact me . Do you have any idea what it was like for me When Joshua 's face started showing up on the news ? I mean , every time I went to the market , to a movie , Take my kids to little league ... People would look at me and see him . That must have been very difficult for you . You know , just because we look alike , It doesn 't mean we have anything in common . We appreciate your time , Mr. Rose . If you hear anything ... Yeah . All this time I thought my brother was a pain in the ass . Gotta go to the d.O.D. They 're ready for me . You sure you 're up for this ? I mean , you just started back to work . Yeah . I can handle it . But thank you ... Mom . Where 's Danielle ? She , uh ... She 's at the store . She 's gonna be back in a minute . I don 't know how to say this , but ... You , uh ... You came to the bank to try and stop me , But you were too late . I mean , I didn 't know . I couldn 't know you were coming . You were trying to stop me from robbing a bank , And I ended up stealing your life . But you 're free now . It took me longer than I thought , But I never gave up . How are our boys ? They 're so big , you 're not gonna believe it . They 're giants . It 's okay . It 's okay . Genetically , you 're exact replicas , You and the other Olivia . Which means , theoretically , You both should be capable of the same thing . In the isolation tank , You 'll be freed from sensory distractions , So the part of your brain Which enables you to travel between universes Should be more accessible . And we will help the process along By giving you a number of psychotropic drugs . There 's a speaker in the tank , So you 'll be able to hear us . And we 'll be monitoring you closely . You ready ? Just like riding the roller coaster At Coney island , right ? Close it . Olivia , can you hear me ? We 'll start the drugs now . Get some rest . Have a sleep , if you like . Now we wait . It 's not working . Increase the doses . 5,000 milligrams of Neurontin , 2,000 elavil . Sir , are you really ... Only those who risk going too far Find out how far they can go . Do it . Oh , hell ! Her heart rate is 183 . Blood pressure is falling . Cameron . I told you not to touch anything . I went somewhere . To a gift shop . There was ... A boy . It worked ! She crossed over . Makes sense now , doesn 't it ? Why they needed you to take their test voluntarily . Why they needed you to believe That you were their Olivia . They know you can cross over . You 've done it before . That 's how you ended up here in the first place . Mom . Hey . Hi . Come in . It 's Tuesday . Yeah . Lunch . I 'm sorry . It just slipped my mind . It 's just been really hectic and ... Yeah . You know . Frank does most of the real cleaning around here . He 's still away . He 's still in north Texas Trying to put a stop to that smallpox outbreak , so ... Olive ... Is everything okay ? Mom , I 'm just tired , And I keep seeing ... I knew a pair of twins in High School ... Nina and Gina . One of them was always so much brighter than the other one , But they both managed to get straight as . I 'll give you one guess how they did that . Olivia . Yeah . I asked you when is he coming back in town ? Mom , I 've gotta go . Um ... I 'm sorry . Do you mind if you ... if you let yourself out ? Sir ? Uh ... They switched . Who ? The twins . When we spoke to Matthew rose today , When he was talking about Joshua 's crimes , He wasn 't angry or ... or upset . He was ... Ashamed . I-it wasn 't like he was embarrassed . It was more like he was guilty . You think Joshua rose Was pretending to be his brother . I think the man we spoke to today Committed those crimes . I think that they switched on us . What is this about ? Identical twins have the same DNA . But fingerprints and retinas are unique . He 's who he says he is . He 's Matthew rose . No . Something 's not right . Dunham , it was just a hunch . They switched again . Liv ... I 'll prove it to you . Dunham . You switched with your brother . What are you talking about ? You know exactly what I 'm talking about . Olivia . Hang on . Okay , we went to your house yesterday . What did we talk about ? What ? At your house . What ... Did we talk about ? Your partner did most of the talking . I told you how hard it was for me and my family When Joshua was robbing banks . He told him . What we looked like , what we talked about . They 're in this together . His brother told him . Dunham . They 're messing with us . They switched . Dunham . Outside . He 's lying . And you can 't prove that I 'm wrong . We can 't prove you 're right either . Liv ... they 're twins . Are you telling me That it 's not in the realm of possibility That they took each other 's place ? Look , even if you 're right , we can 't hold him on a hunch . Colonel , you 've got a visitor upstairs . Colonel broyles , I 'm not sure if you remember me . Of course , Mrs. Dunham . What can I do for you ? Olivia would be furious with me , but ... I think she went back to work too soon . She just hasn 't been herself and ... I 'm worried that there 's something wrong . Hey . You okay ? I mean , that depends . Do you believe me ? Break-in at Langdon chemical two weeks ago . Guess what they stole ? Three tanks of ferrocene . Who uses ferrocene again ? So Joshua rose is planning another heist . Uh ... [ ahem ] sir . Lee , go check it out . Take Francis . Oh ... D-don 't do this to me . Please don 't take me off the case . I think you 've been pushed too hard . Go . Sir , I 'm not crazy . I know I 'm right about this . Dunham ... If I could just follow it through , I ... Dunham ... Go home . How 'd it go ? They know . One of the agents , she knows , man . She knows it was you who spoke to her at the house And we switched . But they let you go ? Yeah . Matty , are you being followed ? I don 't see anyone . You wouldn 't see anybody . That 's the point . What are we gonna do ? Just , um ... Run some errands . Go get a cup of tea . Just don 't come home yet . I need a couple of hours . I 'll take care of this . How ? Just do what I said . Wasn 't supposed to be like this . They weren 't supposed to be this close . Look , I 'm doing my best here ... you know that . Do you know what it was like for him ? In the Amber ? Did he tell you ? Well , he told me . He was aware of every moment . His mind was stuck in the last thought he had Before he was trapped . This horrible feeling of fear ... And loss . Wondering about his family , how we would get along . Can you imagine that ? I have a plan . Oh . What ? You gonna Rob a bank ? One last score to get lost and stay lost , Joshua ? If you really cared about him , you would turn yourself in , Because that is the only way out of this . Oh , nice goal ! Agent Farnsworth , Would you mind taking a look at something for me ? If Joshua rose was about to hit another bank , Where would it be , given his profile and m.O. ? I ran that scenario for Agent Lee an hour ago . I understand , but would you mind Taking another look for me ? There are 37 likely targets based on that criteria . Okay , what assumptions did you make ? Assuming that Joshua rose was taken out of Amber , Necessary parameters would include A subterranean vault , a minimum of $ 50,000 , Proper getaway routes ... wait ... sorry . Assuming that Joshua was removed from the Amber ? We know that he was taken out of the Amber . We know that someone was taken from the Amber . Joshua 's a twin . There 's a 50 % chance that his brother was in Amber And that Joshua broke him out . And Joshua is a brilliant criminal With expertise in breaking into impenetrable areas . Matthew is an accountant . Yes . Okay , so if it was Matthew who was in the Amber , Then Joshua 's m.O. May have changed . I don 't follow your logic . Okay . I think I spoke to Joshua yesterday . He was clearly ashamed . I mean , if he spent the past four years Living with the guilt Of trapping his brother in Amber , Then he 's not gonna want to hurt people like that again . Less human traffic . A remote area . Reduced collateral damage . That would narrow the list of likely targets Down to three ... three banks . Anomalous energy signature detected . Class two breach . Where 's the location ? Parameters match events from 2006 . 79 % probability it was caused by Joshua rose . I need a location . Riverdale mutual . The Bronx . Let 's go , people . She was right . Who ? Agent Dunham . I want science and risk reports now ! That 's Olivia 's car . Chief ! Molecular degradation is increasing . We 're looking at a 200-meter quarantine . Set a perimeter . Best way in is through the main entrance . I want three canisters in the main lobby . A three-point spread with dispersion tubes To the basement And the second floor . We got a busted lock on a subway gate . She could be down there . She could be anywhere . The quarantine protocol 's already in place . Sir , if she 's in there ... it 's a class two breach . We have to seal it before we lose this whole block . Five minutes . Give us five minutes . You got three . Warning . Quarantine protocol imminent . Evacuate the area immediately . Warning . Protocol initiation imminent . What are you doing here ? I found the blueprints . Realized what you 're up to , and I can 't ... Let you do this again . Olivia ! Dunham ! Liv ! Massive loss of life will result . Warning . All right , we gotta move . Okay . Wait . Joshua rose is in there ... We gotta go ! Quarantine protocol initiated . We gotta go ! Massive loss of life will result . Matt , you gotta leave . There 's no time for this . You gotta go right now . You don 't need the money ! Massive loss of life will result . Where are your tools ? Unless they think they have me , they 'll never stop . 30 seconds remaining . There 's no other way . If I turn myself in , they 'll figure it out ... They 'll know I wasn 't the one in the Amber . They 'll take you . You 're the only person alive that survived the quarantine . They 'll experiment on you for the rest of your life . You know that . Warning . 20 seconds to quarantine . Matty ... Matt , you gotta go . I 'm not taking your life twice . Ten seconds to quarantine . Josh ... No ... Matt ... Let me do this one good thing . Quarantine protocol complete . One casualty . Joshua rose . Let 's clean up and go home . Dunham , you hang back . Are you aware of how many protocols you broke ? This area is quarantined . You have no access at this time . No access . Good work . Thank you , colonel . We appreciate your cooperation . This area is now under quarantine . Okay . All civilians must now evacuate the area . This area is now under quarantine . Hello . We found your brother . And I 'm sorry to say He was caught in a quarantine protocol last night . Where ? Riverdale mutual . In the Bronx . He was attempting to break in . Well , thank you for telling me ... Agent . I 'm sorry . True or false ? I take this to my lab , Get them to run this skin sample , They 'd tell me this was from the man Who spent the past four years in Amber . Hey , dad , mom needs you to Stick the steaks on the grill . Okay , buddy . Have a good day . And ... You can consider this investigation closed . You know why you let him go , don 't you ? It 's ' cause you can understand what he 's going through . Trapped in that Amber . It 's just like you 're trapped over here . Only difference is ... Nobody 's going to save you . Only you can save yourself . You listened to me about the case . I don 't understand why you won 't listen to me about this . Why do you refuse to believe who you are ? Why do you want to deny the truth about yourself ? You know , you can 't prove anything that you 're saying . But I know things . You 're in my head . Exactly . Which means you know things too . Things about the other side . Things you couldn 't possibly know unless you 'd been there . Unless you were from there . Like what ? On the other side , the twin towers have fallen . On the other side , your sister Rachel is still alive . She lives in Chicago . Her husband took a job there . They live at 1934 Sherman ... See , now I know you 're lying , Because Rachel hates Chicago . Your beautiful niece Ella is alive . She was born , and it 's her birthday today . She turns seven . There 's no way to prove it . Yes , there is . Brandon . I wanna go back in the tank . You 're not scheduled for another test Until tomorrow . Anything new ? No . But something interesting . About 20 minutes ago , Her brain chemistry spiked . It seems there 's some dormant chemical in her brain . Hmm . Some sort of synthetic compound . From the way it 's bound to her neurons , I 'd say it 's been there since she was a child . Hello ? Hi . Aunt Liv ? You wouldn 't forget my birthday . Aunt Liv ? What happened ? It didn 't work . Nothing happened . All I saw was black .

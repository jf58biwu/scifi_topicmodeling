 As long as Clyde 's partner is still out there , Rossum will go on . We have to cut the head off the snake . And Caroline 's the only one who 's ever met that snake . Where 's the wedge ? Gone . Caroline 's missing . Saunders did this . Rossum got to her . A sleeper . Do you recall your former neighbor , Mellie ? You insisted she come along , I insist she be someone who trusts you entirely . We 're about to go to war . Go , be with each other , even if it 's just for the night . Any good battle plan must be fluid . We 'll be going into full lockdown mode . Where the hell is security ? Why me ? Because you 're very special . You 're going to help us in ways you can 't understand . And I 'm just gonna trust you ? With your life . I know what you 're doing here . I know all about Rossum 's sick experiments . So I gather . You 're quite the supersleuth . You can 't do anything to me . People will find out . People ... will find out ? Caroline , don 't be silly . We both know you could vanish off the face of the earth , and not a soul would notice you were gone . Did you know that Rossum is the world leader in producing MRI machines ? Congratulations . Who cares ? We 're also on the cutting edge of Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's research . Developing the newest atomic force microscopes . We have clinical laboratories in every major city in the world . You know , like , if you 've had your blood drawn to see if you 're a suitable bone marrow donor for your cousin who has leukemia . Rossum likely tested that blood . What did you say ? We like to keep the medical records of everyone who crosses our path , especially the interesting ones . And , Caroline , you are definitely interesting . At least on a microscopic level . What the hell do you want from me ? - Just a few years of your life . - No way . You 're gonna have to kill me . I won 't need to . You 've committed terrorist acts . At best , you 're looking at a lifetime in a federal prison . That 's if they don 't stick a needle in your arm . Adelle DeWitt is downstairs . She 's going to make you an offer . To what ? Let you brainwash me ? Not a chance . Believe me when I tell you , Caroline , this is your only chance . You are special . You have amazing potential . I want to see exactly how far you can go . And I promise you , I will protect you . How do I know I can believe you ? It 's like I said . You 'll learn to trust me . I don 't want to go back . I just found you . The idea of letting you go ... we can walk right out of this building . Find a doctor to rip out the crap they put in our heads and never look back . I couldn 't live with myself . Neither could you . Yeah . Actually , no , I probably could definitely get over it . Ah , here we go . Looks like the war started without us . Phones are dead . Rossum won 't be able to find us that way . Chopper should be here any second . We can 't wait for them much longer . We can wait . How 's the neck ? A little sore . I think the bleeding stopped . Wasn 't exactly a surgical procedure . Sorry about that . I 'm not . Thought of them being able to track me wherever I go ... I 'm just glad it 's out . Sorry . I 'm sorry . They said the way I feel about you is just a program . I 'm ... I 'm trying to remember that . It 's okay . I 'm ... I 'm glad we 're together , no matter what happens . Look lively . Someone 's coming . Is that them ? Or Rossum found us . Let 's be prepared for either eventuality . It 's us . Where 's echo ? I need help . Stop , it 's on fire ! It 's burning me ! - What 's wrong with her ? ! - I don 't know . I don 't know . It 's burning me . - What happened ? - We got attacked . - They 're coming . - You 're okay . You 're not burning . - Hold her . - It hurts ... How did this happen ? - Why is she like this ? - Doesn 't make any sense . I imprinted her as Caroline . I ate the butt of a rifle . I wake up , and she 's mental . The wedge must have been too damaged . No . Bennett fixed the wedge . She died fixing it . Then maybe echo and Caroline are not getting along . We need to reevaluate the game plan here . No . Nothing 's changed . Boyd , you got shot . Than shot before . I 've got plenty of meds . We have to get to Tucson , break into Rossum and destroy that mainframe . It 's impossible now . Caroline was the only one who could get us in the building . She 's the only one who could identify Rossum 's founder . Without her , we 're screwed . If we don 't try , everything echo 's done , everything she 's become will be for nothing . It 's up to us to finish this . How do we even get inside , Boyd ? We walk in through the front door . There 's no need to sneak around . We have something Rossum wants . Come on . They got the hard drives . No security footage . They knew exactly what they were doing , exactly how to cover their tracks . How do you feel about getting the hell out of here ? Anthony ? Look at this . Must be some kind of program . No , not a program . A person . This chair ... it changes you into someone else . Well , maybe it 's somebody who could tell us what happened . No . We said we wouldn 't do this . No more technology . - But this could help us . - Or kill us . We don 't know who left that note there . I don 't want to lose you again . Oh , babe . Look , you said it yourself . We have to help our friends . And this chair right here might be our only shot . And you know , no matter who I am , no matter what they put in my skull , I always remember you . That won 't change . But if I turn evil ... Shoot me . I 'm not going to kill you . Well , seriously wound me , then . Just , you know , try to stay away from the junk . Okay . Do it . Oh , God ! Uh , take it ... take it easy ! Oh . Did it ... did it , uh , not work ? Where did everyone go ? Uh , did they change their minds ? Who are you ? Oh ... no . That is not good . That 's very ... bad . What am I wearing ? Tell me who you are ! Oh . It 's me ... Topher . Geez , why are we arming the dolls ? I 'm not a doll . I 'm Priya . Oh , interesting . So , you 're ... you 're you . So , the question is ... where am I ? So , you don 't know what happened here ? Oh , God ! Am I dead ? You 're gonna want to come down here . Good morning . Can we help you ? I very much doubt it . I 'm looking for the man in charge . And you are ... ? Adelle DeWitt . We haven 't met , but I 've heard all about you . She killed Bennett . She 's not Claire . He 's quick . Very quick . What did you do with her ? I guess I just sort of evicted her . Tossed her out on the digital street , as it were . I 'm not big on sentimentality . And you , my dear . So excited to see you again . You never know how these types of experiments are going to work out . I am a lucky boy . Right here at my doorstep . All you 're missing is the little bow . Who the hell are you ? Clyde Randolph . Cofounder of Rossum . I thought Clyde was stuck in the attic . Not anymore . My original got himself caught in a loop . This world is for people who can evolve . And does that include us ? Isn 't that what you 're here to find out ? This is terrible . I want my body back . It was a nice body . I mean , I cover it up half the time with plaid and cotton-poly blends , but I took pride in my physique . I had a physique , do you understand ? I mean , this body 's okay and everything , - but , I mean , still ... - we don 't know you 're dead . We don 't know whose blood that is . Then where am I , Sierra ? Priya . Is that really the most important issue right now ? Who else would have left the Topher wedge behind ? I mean , how could you have done that if you were dead ? You have a point . You have a point . Right . Right , right . Why would I leave a backup wedge ? Still thinking . Well , something only Topher would know . Yeah , frankly 90 % of the things in my head ; no one else knows . It would help to get caught up on the state of things here . I mean , for example , who are the dead dudes ? Hit men from the Rossum , I 'm guessing . We 're at war with the Rossum Corporation , by the way . Oh ! Fine . So , uh ... Who killed them ? We don 't know . The security footage was taken . Shut up ! I had a camera installed . No one else knew about it . See ? I was trying to catch a thief . I 'm pretty sure Ivy 's been stealing my Turkey jerkies . Here 's the last thing it recorded . What was that ? What 's wrong with her ? Back it up . He threw something away . What 's this ? Looks like a syringe . I don 't understand . He drugged echo . Why would he drug echo ? Not echo . Caroline . She was going to tell us who the founder of Rossum is . Boyd 's working for Rossum . You know , Adelle , I have to thank you . None of this could have happened without you . It 's an exciting time , and you have been a good little worker bee . I 'm happy to be of service , Mr. Randolph . Though honestly , I 'm not sure I 'm deserving of such high praise . What ? Above anything , Caroline is your success . You nurtured her , fostered her growth . Guided her to become what she is now . And what is that ? Our savior . Caroline 's going to save the world ? No , no . Not the world . Just the deserving few . You 'll be happy to know , you 'll be counted among them . Unfortunately , in her present state , Caroline isn 't fit to save anyone . I 'm afraid we scrambled her head one time too many . The mind doesn 't matter . It 's the body we want . He always knew you 'd be the one to deliver her to us . Our mysterious founder . I 'd like to thank him for his faith in me . I know he 's looking forward to that moment . Do you think they 're going to let us out of here ? You 'll be okay . We 'll find a way . No , no , you don 't want to do that . That 's just gonna loop back on you . Topher . What ? Stop breathing on me . Why did they take echo ? I don 't know . - Got it . - You did that ? - You did that ! - They must have a weapons cache in this building . Find it . - I 'll take Topher with me . - No . I need him . We 're going to go after Caroline . Be careful . They 'll kill us all if they get a chance . Good luck . We 've been betrayed ! By my best man friend . Soft spoken , mild-mannered , Benedict Boyd . Although , I got to admit , I 'm kinda of impressed . Why can 't I find Mellie ? Chip 's deactivated . I mean , that dude can act . I don 't know whether I want to kill him or get his autograph . Oh , we have to go ! We have to help them ! Uh , hold on , cowgirl . How do you plan on doing that ? If you haven 't noticed , Rossum sort of has ways of doing , well , this a lot ! I don 't care . I can 't just sit here . We have to fight . That is so Ripley of you and it 's supersexy , but can I make a suggestion ? Anthony . He 's a soldier , right ? I will sacrifice my personhood and give you back your boyfriend ... And then some . And then some what ? Enhancements . Mad skills . Ninja , hacking , combat training . Cooking ? Doesn 't seem that important now , but if you two end up getting married , you 'll thank me . If , if . I could do you , too . No . No more imprints . Not for Anthony . Not for me . Look , I get it . I get it . The tech is responsible for all of this . But in this particular instance , why not give the good guys a fighting chance ? I can 't believe I have to work a double shift two days in a row . I know . I 've already worked ten hours of overtime this week . Looks like they cleared the place out . I want to tell you something . Something important . Echo ... Caroline . Whatever happened to her , it wasn 't a bad wedge . Bennett fixed it . I saw it . And anyway , if the wedge wasn 't fixed , it wouldn 't make echo lose her marbles like that . This is something else . What do you think it is ? I don 't have proof , but I 'll tell you what it feels like . It 's eerily similar to Sierra when nolan drugged her . You think someone drugged echo ? How ? It had to be someone in the Dollhouse . I don 't know who . Yet . But I 'm working on it . I left a little helpful something-something back at the ranch . What does that mean ? My backup wedge . Topher 2.0 . I left it in the chair . Hopefully Victor and Sierra came back , fired it up , and are on their way here with reinforcements . Go team ! Thank you for confiding in me , Topher . Of course . Bros before others who aren 't bros . D-level is clear . D-level is clear . I need you to stay here . That guard has a firearm . We could use one right now . I 've done my part . Go do yours . Hey . How do you feel ? I don 't know . I don 't feel any different . Maybe it didn 't take . Well ... well , that 's different . Yeah . I 'm suddenly okay with this . Looks like somebody from Tucson knows we 're here . What do you say we take the fight to them ? You have to trust me . They 're not just experimenting with animals . Did I fall a sleep ? This isn 't a nightmare . What do they need babies for ? Hang in there , Leo please ! Don 't leave me ! Caroline ! This is the shape of things to come . You 'll learn to trust me . Boyd . Maybe I should have a gun , too . No . What about a taser ? Look at this ... to be a kid in this sandbox . I can only imagine the toys they have in here . Seriously ? You gotta show me how you do that . Let 's check it out . What about echo and everything ? What do you make of this ? That 's my tech . The one DeWitt handed over to harding . I thought it would take Rossum years to realize my schematics . Now that they have ? We 're even more screwed than we thought . With this , you can wipe and imprint anyone . No need for an active 's cranial architecture in your coconut . One zap with the laser ... You 're a doll ! Whoa ! Boyd , whoa ! What is wrong with you ? It doesn 't work . Well , good ! Maybe they don 't have the cojones to finish the job . They 're set up for mass production . This is catastrophic . What are you doing ? Boyd , look around ! They 're going to weaponize the tech . My tech . Why ? For weapons ! Topher , think . That 's what got us here in the first place . I 'm going for mindless destruction now . We can use this , Topher . If the tech stays , in our hands , we control it . We can stop Rossum , and get out of this building without taking another life . All you have to do is fix one of them . Can you do it ? In my sleep . Get to it then . Oh , I don 't think so . I 'm afraid . So am i . That 's why we have guns . Take it . - You have to learn to protect yourself . - Yeah . I guess I can 't rely on you to protect me all the time . - That 's not what I meant . - I know . But it 's true . Why am I here , Paul ? I guess ... I couldn 't let you go . That 's very sweet . I don 't believe you . I 'm not real , Paul . - I know this . - Yes , you are . I 'm a program . So am i . And I decided , it doesn 't matter anymore . We feel what we feel . And I didn 't want to reach the end without you . Okay ? Okay . What 's next ? We find the mainframe . Oh , this is simple . What 's that ? It can transmit an imprint via directional laser to the brain , but it doesn 't know how to get the brain to answer . It 's not syncing . Like when your Bluetooth can 't find your cell . What 's the fix ? The diode is reverse-biased . Dope the semiconductors at the bipolar junction , voilà . A team of engineers couldn 't crack that , but you , Topher Brink , you did it in ten minutes . You truly are amazing . I 'm glad I chose you . Chose me for what ? What are you doing ? ! Echo ! Echo ! Stop ! Stop , it 's Boyd ! Echo ! I have enhanced weapons skills . Anyone care to see a demonstration ? The brit goes first . What the hell is going on ? Boyd 's the founder . He was going to kill you . What are you talking about ? There is no way , not a chance on this earth ... It 's true , Mr. Brink . Boyd ? You ? You really think I was going to kill Topher ? Why bring him here ? Not just me ? Why the party charades ? You really don 't know ? You 're here ' cause you 're my family . I love you guys . What is that ? The cooling system . The mainframe generates a lot of heat . It takes just as much energy to cool it down . This means we 're getting close . Come on . What are you doing ? What if it doesn 't ? - Doesn 't what ? - Cool down . It might be all fun for you to shoot your way into a highly-fortified mainframe , but couldn 't we just pull the plug on the ac ? And overheat the servers . Thank God you 're here . So , you 're working with Saunders . That means when she killed Bennett , you killed Bennett . Everyone has had to sacrifice . That 's what 's made you all so incredible : Your commitment , your skills . Everything I 've thrown at you , you 've taken , and asked for more . Look at you , Topher . Risking your life for the cause , choosing morality over self-preservation . And you , Adelle . You found a strength and conviction I 'll bet you didn 't even know you had . I pushed you , and you pushed right back . Wow ! Wow , Boyd . You 're right . I 'm the tinman , she 's the lion , and you 're the head of the lollipop guild who 's a traitor . You 've proven yourselves in so many ways . I wanted you all with me . Except for Paul . There 's always one relative you can live without . And frankly , I never understood what you saw in him . So you want us to keep you company , fiddling while rome burns ? Thank you very much . I 'd rather be dead . Death will be a blessing . When it happens , you 'll likely be imprinted and enslaved . We have to face the facts . The technology exists . It can 't be un-invented . Once it gets out there , it will be abused . None of us can prevent that from happening , but we can choose where we want to be , and on what side , when the end finally does arrive . Do you want to be the destroyed , or the destroyers ? You are spectacularly insane . I believed you . You pretended to care for me , and I believed you . How could you do that ? I know you 're angry . Don 't touch me . I did ... I do care for you . More than you 'll ever know . Who do you think allowed you to grow as an individual ... as echo ? While they were sending you out to bed half of Los Angeles , I was here making sure you had the space to become your own person . - Why ? - You 're the key . The key to everything . You 're going to save us all . I won 't save you , Boyd . Given the first chance , I will kill you . I have no doubt you 'll try . But the fact still remains that inside that body of yours is everlasting life . Every time your nervous system blocks an imprint , it leaves neurochemical tracers in your cerebrospinal column . We 've tried to replicate it , but we can 't . It 's unique to your physiology . So we 're going to harvest it from you . What are you talking about ? We 're going to use your spinal fluid to make a vaccine against imprinting . Is such a thing even possible ? The mad scientist in me says , " yes . " You come any closer , I will snap your neck . I 'm sorry , echo . I really am . Tell me they taught you how to sabotage supercomputers at quantico . Right after the course on toppling evil corporations bent on world domination . Where do we start ? How about here ? I don 't think there 's an elegant way to do this . Good . I hate elegant . Me , too . Bring the secondary cooling system online . I 'll handle the rest . There 's a phrase I want you to say . How does it go ? Something about flowers in a vase . Activate Mellie 's sleeper protocol ? I won 't do it . Go ahead and shoot . I 'm sure I 'll be far more talkative with my brains splattered all over Topher . What now ? We 're going to have company . Come on . Aim , breathe , fire . It 's set for single shots , so you don 't need to crazy , okay ? You just have to hold on until echo finish the job . You got this . There are three flowers in a vase . Mellie ! Cover your ears ! The third flower is green . Mellie ! It 's me , Paul ! I 'm not going to shoot you ! Listen to me . You 're not a killer ! Mellie , remember us ! Remember what we had ! Paul ? I ... I can 't . You can . You can fight this . You know who you are . When we were together , you made me feel like a real person . No ! There 's no reason to be scared . The entire process is designed to extract your spinal fluid without killing you . Everything 's going to be all right . Go to hell . Begin the extraction . Get her out of that thing , or you 're going to end up with a dozen holes - in your back . - Okay , okay . Move ! Thought you two would be on a beach in cancun by now . Never left a man behind before . Not going to start today . Besides , we 're a family . Do ... do me a favor . Call us whatever you want , just not family . You know about Boyd ? Yeah . Didn 't see that one coming . He 's holding Adelle and Topher in a research lab , same level , other side of facility . Free them , then find Paul and Mellie . Get everybody out of here . What are you going to do ? Something Caroline tried to do two years ago . Shut this place down for good . I did all this . I 'm the one who brings about the thought-pocalypse . Thought-pocalypse ? Is brain-pocalypse better ? I figure , if I 'm responsible for the end of the world , I get to name it . I gave the plans to harding . I 'm just as culpable . Thanks , Adelle . You handed someone a piece of paper . I invented it . Which means , I have to destroy it . Stop . They 'll kill you . - Are you all right ? - Take cover . Excuse me ? Now ! Army of one . Are you still me ? Because I could use someone to shoulder some of the guilt . It 's Anthony . With some enhancements . Clearly . What next ? Mr. Brink ? We destroy the prototypes , the plans for the prototypes , and every piece of equipment used to make the prototypes . We wipe this tech off the face of the earth . Who let the lab rat out of its cage ? Claire ... Whiskey , whoever can hear me ... This isn 't you . Deep down , you know it 's true . You can overpower him . Claire . Still Clyde . You know , this is the first time I can hit a girl without feeling bad about it . You think Topher loaded me up with nice personalities ? I will scrub the floor with you . 15 years of switching bodies . I 've made some improvements to the os . Besides , I don 't care what happens to this body . You do . What do you mean , she escaped ? No . I 'll deal with it . Mellie . She killed Mellie . What ? Adelle . She triggered Mellie , and ... She killed herself . I 'm sorry , Paul . She 's evil , Boyd . We have to stop her . I know . Whoever 's running things got to her . She turned on all of us . Let 's take that bitch down for good . I know just where she is . At this rate , we 're going to kill each other . I have 20 houses filled with bodies waiting for me . Even if you 're on life support , we can still tap your spine . Echo ? Paul , what are you doing ? Take it easy . It 's ... What did I miss ? It 's him . He 's the founder . He 's been lying to us this whole time . Question is , who are you ? Caroline ? Echo ? I 'm everything - you made me . - Good . Then that means you still trust me with your life . You said you 'd protect me . I believed you . You son of a bitch ! I did protect you . Now it 's your turn to protect all of us . You 're going to be the savior of the world . I trusted you . Shoot . Don 't think . - Shoot . - She can 't . Caroline doesn 't know you , but echo loves you . She 'd never ... I wanted to keep you around because I like you , but I don 't really need you alive . I loved you . I know . Did I fall asleep ? For a little while . I want you to take this . After I leave , walk into there ... and pull the pin out . Do you understand ? Yes . I try to be my best . Good . Everybody out ! Go ! Go ! Go ! I got Saunders out . Move ! Move ! Move ! Where 's echo ? She said she 's coming . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Let 's go , people ! So , did we save the world ? I guess we did . Let them go . We got to keep moving . . : Napisy24 - Nowy Wymiar Napisów : . Napisy24.pl

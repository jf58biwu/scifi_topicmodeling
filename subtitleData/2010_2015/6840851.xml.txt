 NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe : OLIVIA : In Jacksonville , there was a height chart with names . Other kids from Walter and Bell 's Coretexiphan trials . OLIVIA : I made a list . Nick Lane and James Heath . They were both part of Walter 's tests . Of all the children that Walter and I prepared , you were the strongest . A storm is coming , and when it is over , I fear there will be little left of our world . I 'm not from here , am I ? You didn 't just open up a hole to the other side , you brought me back . It 's why I can 't remember my childhood . - You were dying ... - Why my mother committed suicide . She knew . Peter checked himself out of the hospital three hours ago . He 's gone . NEWTON : Mr. Secretary . Hello , son . ( CHATTERING ) TECH : Anomalous energy signature detected . Local . Brooklyn . ( ALARM BEEPING ) - Confirmed . We 've got a breach . MAN 1 : Lock it down . I was thinking , " Hey , maybe a slow day . It being Saturday and all . " - No rest for the wicked . - You 're not wicked , Charlie . You just pretend really , really well . - Somebody playing my song ? TECH : Class one event , sir . I can see that . - You ? - Yes , I can . - Clear as day . BROYLES : Okay , people . Nap time 's over . Let 's go to work . So exactly how big would the worms get if you stopped dosing yourself ? They 're not worms ... - They 're arachnids . - They 're arachnids . Sit rep as follows . Class one molecular dissolution . Numbers show severe molecular cohesion failure . This isn 't just a little tear . We got a full-fledged hole . Anything come through ? No data yet . On site in less than 60 seconds . - As long as it 's not bugs . - Oh , it 's probably bugs . What ? Bugs like you . On my six . ( SIREN WAILING ) MAN 1 : Go , go , go ! MAN 2 : Move , move , move ! I want science and risk reports in three minutes . CHARLIE : Site 's secure , boss . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) ( HUMMING ) Chief , this is bad . I 'M showing stage-three degradation . I need data that tells me this event is contained . LINCOLN : I 'M trying here . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) Damn it . We 're in potential quarantine range here , sir . - Send up a looker . Stat . TECH : A looker 's being dispatched now , sir . Hi . I 'm Agent Dunham , Fringe Division . Can I see your show-me , please ? Yeah , sure . You ain 't gonna quarantine the place , right ? There 's nothing to worry about . But if you could tell me what you saw ? Even small things could be important . I 'm getting decreased gravity measurements . ( DEVICE BEEPS ) Activating quarantine potentiator . Agent Farnsworth . Broyles . Phillip . Colonel . Risk assessment . I need to know if this thing is spreading . - We can 't have another Boston . - I know that . You think I don 't know that ? DEVICE : Quarantine device unlocked . Recommendation , agent ? Quarantine will result in excess of 10,000 casualties . DEVICE : Warning . One minute to quarantine . Massive loss of life will result . Warning . Recommendation , agent ? ASTRID : Gravitational molecular degeneration are decreasing but outside acceptable parameters . - Recommendation , Agent Farnsworth . - Calculating . DEVICE : Massive loss of life will result . - Really ? DEVICE : Forty seconds to quarantine . Quarantine device unlocked . - I didn 't even update my will . - Massive loss of life will result . - Frank would just spend it anyway . - Warning , 30 seconds to quarantine . Recommendation , Agent Farnsworth . Event is terminating . No quarantine recommended . Captain , you are clear . Do not quarantine . - Repeat , do not quarantine . DEVICE : Twenty seconds to quarantine . LINCOLN : We gotta stop doing this . DEVICE : Massive loss of life will ... CHARLIE : Hey , guys . We got something up here . I wish it was bugs . OLIVIA : What is that ? LINCOLN : These look like carcinomas . No way anyone could live long enough to develop tumors this severe . - Witnesses have anything ? - The usual . Heard a tearing sound . Saw a blue flash through the window . I gave them chips for radiation scans . I 'll see if he has any ID . Guy may have had a wife and kids before the universe sucked him up and spat him out . OLIVIA : Poor guy . That 's not a show-me . Okay . Check this out . Who the hell is Jackson ? WALTER ( WHISPERING ) : Olivia ! Come on . Come on . Let 's go . Keep down . ( INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ) Come on . Come on . Fringe s2e22 Over There 1 WALTER : I can take you back where you belong , son . They have our coordinates . But if you come with me , you won 't be able to come back here . You have to make a choice , Peter . PETER : Let 's go . ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) - Hello ? WALTER : Hello , Agent Dunham . There 's something I 'm supposed to remember and I can 't ... - ... but it 's about Peter . - Walter ? I think something is going to happen to him . Something ... Something terrible . WALTER : Oh , my . I think this is what I 'm supposed to remember . Okay . One of those men , the Observers , I think he left it for me . After I brought Peter from the other side some years later , one of them came to visit me . He told me I had to agree to never let Peter return to the other side . - Why ? - Because if I did , this would happen . But what is this , Walter ? What does it even mean ? It is exactly what it appears to be . See ? I think my son is going to be responsible for the end of the world . - Walter , we have to get Peter back . - He went over by his own free will . - He didn 't know about this . - Even if he wanted to come back ... - How do we get him back ? - We have no way ... Walter ! How ? GUARD : I 'm sorry , sir , I can 't let you in ... - Don 't even think about it ! What is this ? You 're manufacturing weapons for the other side . - That 's absurd . - I want all your data ... - ... related to the other universe . - How dare you ! Stop it ! Both of you . Peter is in danger . Walter says that this technology has a specific and recognizable design . I dare say Nina would agree . - Dear God . What side is this ? - Does it matter ? This is William 's technology , but we didn 't build it . Okay , Nina , listen to me . Peter 's been taken . You have to help us cross over . The thing is , to get Over There , that 's really a misnomer . In truth , the two universes are overlapping . And to get to the other side , our universe needs to pass through you . Literally . Like water passing through a cheesecloth . Our cells need to separate on an atomic level . Problem is , when they come back together they don 't come back together with the same cohesion . Somehow Bell managed to cross back and forth although precisely how we can find no record . But I suspect that whatever methodology he crossed so many times that he has become like this coffee cup . Molecularly unstable . As many atoms in each of us as there are stars in the sky . That 's why Belly never came back , isn 't it ? He was scared that the same thing would happen to him . I don 't know . I 've sent him communications but if he got them , he hasn 't been able to communicate to me . There has to be a way . What about how you went over when you first got Peter ? The last time I opened a door , it set in motion the ripples that weakened the very fabric of our reality . To do so again could instantly shatter both worlds and likely would . Brandon , give us a moment . Unlike William , you have the ability to cross over safely . I can 't . I ... I mean , I can 't control it . I 've flashed over for a few seconds or Bell 's pulled me over . But I can 't control it . Not on my own . Not on your own . But if there were two or three of you , a larger power supply , as it were . - I 'm not following . - With more Coretexiphan children their collective psychic energy could ... You know , Belly and I always agreed that the primal part of the brain which allows us to cross universes is also responsible for a host of paranormal activities . Pyrokinesis , telepathy , thought control . We all had these abilities until a moment in history when something was done to us and it was shut down . I suspect aliens . Unfortunately , the only other Coretexiphan children we have located they have failed . Or worse . You are the only one left . Actually , she 's not . BROYLES : Over a dozen Coretexiphan subjects unaccounted for . Prudence dictated we determine what we might deal with in the future . So you woke all three of them up ? Actually , five . We 've tracked down some others . Okay . About six weeks ago , Massive Dynamic proposed a series of experiments to help them gain control of and re-purpose their abilities . These three have been successful . James Heath can now cure disease , not cause it . Sally Clark is becoming a fully functional pyrokinetic . And your friend Nick Lane 's empathic transfers can now be controlled . Olive . ( ALL LAUGHING ) Nick . Very good , baby . Welcome to the monkey house . - This is new . Who authorized it ? - Senate Intelligence , thanks to Peter . It was part of a list of demands he gave before I went to secure our funding . This is very Mission : Impossible . I know you . You 're the man that experimented on us . - I could kill you where you stand . WALTER : Each of you could . What I did was inexcusable . Barbaric . The collateral damage has been extensive . But know that we had noble goals . We believed that our world needed guardians . Protectors . And that you children would be those protectors . Fostered your talents because we foresaw that the day would come when both universes would be in jeopardy . So horrible as it is to say today is the day for which you were created . What I could never have imagined is that I would be asking you to help me save my son . So sorry . Well , if none of you are going to kill me I think I 'll go and have a bit of a cry . Man , that 's not the same guy I remember . He 's exactly the same . Dr. Bishop has identified a likely spot to attempt a crossover . Brooklyn , New York . You go at 0800 tomorrow morning . - You might wanna get some rest . JAMES : Hey , FBI guy . We 're about to go save the world , right ? Two worlds even . Can 't we have a night off ? Whatever they want . ( EKG BEEPING ) Who are you ? I was never lucky , you know ? Sometimes people need some good luck . Tonight , I guess that 's me . Who else do we have ? - Sweet . - Mm . Me or the strawberry ? Both . What would you like this time ? To feel what I 'm feeling ? Or what you 're feeling ? Both . Please God ... Aunt Liv . What time is it ? It 's early . I have to go on a trip and I wanted to give you something before I left . It 's pretty . My mother , your grandmother gave it to me before she died . She told me that it would keep me safe . So now I 'm giving it to you . Thanks , Aunt Liv . You are welcome , baby girl . RACHEL : You 're up early . I didn 't even hear you come in last night . - No , I 've been working a case . - Think you 'll be home for dinner ? I hope so . I 'll call you and let you know . Okay . Hey , you okay ? Yeah . We should do this more often . It 's nice . Sure . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Look what Aunt Liv gave me . Assuming this works , that you make it to the other side you still have no idea how to locate Peter . No , but I spoke to Nina Sharp . She sent a message to William Bell asking him to meet us at Greyshot Bridge in Central Park . I think he 'll help us . Dunham , Massive Dynamic didn 't make that weapon over here . Bell may have made it on the other side , for them . No . I trust him . In any case , Nina has no confirmation Bell even gets her messages . - No . - You 're invading enemy territory without a plan . You don 't know about the opposition , the landscape . ( DOOR OPENS ) Oh . We 're ready . We 're ready to try this . You can 't tell me you think this is a good idea . No . I don 't think that this is a good idea . But you got a better one ? It was lovely , wasn 't it ? Now faded and broken . Just like me . So how does this work , Walter ? Remember your Shakespeare , dear . " All the world is a stage . " Or in this case , both worlds . You will form a circle . I will stand in the middle and I will lead you across . BROYLES : No . You can 't do this . Oh , no . No . He is my son , Olivia . You can 't do this . I won 't allow it . I believe I can . Or else they cannot . I can 't ask them to do something that I 'm not willing to chance myself . Thank you . Well , if any of you have changed your minds , I will understand . We were talking about it on the way over here . Maybe you did damage us but , on the other hand , maybe you made us special . Fate is a tricky thing . So you would want to take a few steps back , I think , Agent Broyles . Olivia . Now , I want you to clear your minds and just relax , all right ? Now ignore everything except the sound of my voice . Now spread out your arms . You remember how . Spread them out to each other . Yes . Good . I want you to think back to when you were just young children . Back to when you were just young boys and girls . Think back to when your imagination could take you wherever you wanted to go . Imagine this universe slipping away opening like a curtain . Allow the universe to pass right through you . Allow your imagination to take you to the other side . ( GRUNTS ) - James . James . James . - Help me ! OLIVIA : Walter , what do we do ? - Look . We made it . We 're on the other side . Okay , come on , James . You gotta get up . We gotta hide now . Nick . Nick , I don 't feel so good . NICK : Oh , God . WALTER : Through here . ( SIRENS WAILING ) MAN 1 : Go , go , go ! MAN 2 : Move , move , move ! I want science and risk reports in three minutes . ( WHISPERING ) Nick . Nick . Make them leave . ( WHISPERING ) I 've been trying , it 's not working . What 's wrong with us ? - I don 't know . - Nick , I 'm scared . OLIVIA : Check this out . Who the hell is Jackson ? - Got a Junior ? - Yep . Going to a strip club later ? Someone 's gotta visit your sister . ( OLIVIA CHUCKLES ) OLIVIA : The paper 's real . The detail is amazing . Why would someone go to this trouble ? BROYLES : What in God 's name did y 'all find ? Nothing useful . Dead end so far . Whatever it is you scanned just raised a red flag at the DOD . The secretary wants to see you . OLIVIA : Hey , Charlie , you haven 't met him ? I shook his hand when I graduated the academy . What about you ? - My dad knew him . - That explains so much . You don 't wanna leak worms all over the guy . Makes a bad first impression . They 're not worms . He 's waiting for you . Go in . ASSISTANT : Mr. Secretary ? Thank you . Agent Lee , I 'm sorry about your father . - He was a good man . Fine jurist . - Thank you . - And this is your team ? LINCOLN : Yes , sir . - Agents Francis and Dunham . - Sir . I understand you 're investigating a Fringe event , Brooklyn ? - Correct , sir . - And in this event there was a casualty ? A man ? Correct , sir . So far we haven 't been ... Agent , I believe I may have insight into who that man is and where he was from . What I 'm about to tell you is classified . But I think it 's time you knew what you were dealing with . Agent Dunham , what can you tell me about the Fringe Division ? Okay , I 'll play . Uh ... Fringe Division is a special adjunct branch of the Department of Defense . Its primary focus is natural disasters that began in 1985 with the Zero Event at Reiden Lake . And what are these natural disasters ? They 're holes in the fabric of the universe . A-plus . And how do you know this ? I know it because I read it in the ZFT in 1995 when you wrote and published it . ZFT . Natural decay of our world . What would you say if I told you that the ZFT is a lie ? Or a half-truth , anyway . These tears are not natural . They are the work of man . These holes don 't simply lead to nothing . - There is something on the other side . - What ? - Another one . - Bravo . - Another what ? WALTER : Another universe . A parallel Earth , just like this but slightly different . And it was their attempt to penetrate our world which created the pattern of destruction that we struggle with daily . - The $ 20 bill was ... - From the other side . And so was he . And I suspect he didn 't come alone . As you know , I am not a lover of war but I have reason to believe that these invaders are anything but peaceful . They must be found . And they must be found quickly . We 'll get them , sir . I 'm burning up , Nick . It 'll be fine , baby . Scan your ID , lady . OLIVIA : Sorry . We 're gonna have to walk . Central Park is 59th Street , three miles from here . Okay , then , we better get started . - Hi . - Hi . How are you feeling ? - I 'm okay . - You 've been asleep for three days . Your fa ... Walter said you might feel a bit dizzy . Maybe you 'd like to sit down ? I 'm okay . You must be starving . I made some eggs and bacon . Do you still like bacon ? When you were a boy , we ... I love bacon . Oh , Peter . I 've missed you so much . ( SOBBING ) ( SALLY GROANING ) NICK : Stop a second . - It 's fine . I 'm fine . Let 's go . You 've gotta know something . What 's wrong with us ? I suspect that somehow the human circuit was flawed . Did any of you engage in extreme use of abilities last night ? - Far more than normal ? - No . Perhaps poor Mr. Heath ... - You 've got to help her . - I can 't . But if we 're lucky , perhaps William Bell can . It 's the Grand Hotel . They never built it . Things that might have been in our world but weren 't . Come on . It 's not far . ELIZABETH : Coffee 's quite hard to come by over here . It 's been rationed for some time now . But Walter 's very well-connected . It 's funny , I never had bacon when I was growing up . My mother was a vegetarian , she never made it . Until today , I always thought I imagined having it as a kid . I 'm sorry . My mother from the other side . Right . I 'm sure you don 't wanna hear about that . No , on the contrary , I want to hear all about your childhood . What 's ... ? Are you close with her still ? I mean ... Did she take good care of you ? She took very good care of me . But she committed suicide about 10 years ago . My mother from the other side she was wonderful , but she wasn 't strong . In fact , she was very , very sad . Which I suppose is because of me . No . Listen , Peter . In the end we have to take responsibility for our own decisions , the good and the bad . Your father 's going to be so pleased to see you . He said he wanted me to help him with something . Yes . He 's staying in the city tonight , but he asked me to give you this . Oh , God . Look , Nick . These are my favorite . Can I get one ? NICK : I don 't think so . We gotta go . I ... I like it here . Maybe ... Maybe we can stay . Nick I 'm gonna stay . I know , baby . I know . Come on , let 's go . NICK : Do you see him ? William Bell ? No . There 's a water fountain . Come on , I think it 'll help . ( SALLY PANTING ) Are we late ? Maybe he didn 't get the message . ( POLICE SIRENS WAILING ) No . - Bell has betrayed us . - Run , run , run ! LINCOLN : Don 't move ! ( NICK GRUNTS ) AGENT 1 : Go , go , go ! Watch your cover ! Walter . Walter ! Nick ? I think I 'm staying here . You stay , we stay together . Look , I don 't wanna hurt you . Step away . Screw you . Hey ! AGENT 2 ( OVER RADIO ) : Man down . Med team to Greyshot Bridge . Man down . OLIVIA : Lincoln ? Liv . Hey . Where 's the ambulance ? ( PANTING ) ( POLICE SIREN WAILING ) Dizzy . Must be the onset of hemorrhagic shock . ( GROANS ) But I 'm still walking so the bullet couldn 't have hit my spinal column . I 'll be perfectly fine . Excuse me . Do you really understand all these ? Maybe . I 'm not sure yet . Good night , Peter . Night . ( SIREN WAILING ) FRANK : Hey . - Oh . - Oh . FRANK : Mm . I tried to wait up . - Hey , baby . - How is he ? He 's got third-degree burns over 90 percent of his body . He 's gonna need three months in a nanite regeneration chamber . But he 'll live . I 'm sorry . And on your last night . I 'm going for a week , not until the end of time . - Yeah . It 's details . - Might be a good day to start drinking . Oh , God . I would if I could only stand the taste . So , what happened out there ? Just a small anomaly that set off a fuel cell . It was just bad luck of the draw , is all . - Come on , no more work . - I know what you need . Yeah ? What 's that ? Back rub . Oh , you are a god . - I 'll get the oil . - Really ? On your last night ? I 'll take it . Hello , Olivia . It 's good to see you again . - How did ... ? How did you know ... ? - I suspected you would come here . So where were you at the park ? I received Nina 's message but when I got there it was too late , there was nothing I could do . My dear Olivia . I know you have good reason not to trust me but I 'm afraid you 're going to have to . Walter is in trouble and I 'm quite confident we don 't have much time .

 Previously on Fringe ... The shape-shifters ... on your side are looking for someone . William Bell told me that Newton would try to open a doorway from our universe to the other side . You once built a door that let you walk between worlds . Tell me how you did it . - I can save him . - Peter is dead . We 're talking about the other Peter , the one on the other side . - You 're not my father ! - Of course I am . I 've done enough damage . I have to tell him who he really is . You feel that ? What ? The ... the shaking . A whole lot of shakin ' goin ' on . No , I 'm serious . And you 're stoned . Give me that . I thought you said this place was abandoned . I 'm gonna check it out . - We should just go . - No , just hang tight . I 'll be fine . What the hell ? This totally sucks . What took you so long ? You scared the hell out of me . I want to leave here , Dave . Fringe 2x19 The Man From the Other Side Original Air Date April 22th , 2010 - - Sync by elderman - - - - Corrected by chamallow Kerensky - - Oh , come on , Walter , not again . I 'm just rearranging . Uh , it 's not quite right yet . It 's fine . And it was fine yesterday and fine the day before that . A well-ordered house is the sign of a well-ordered mind . Yeah , but staying up all night to find the perfect place for your laundry hamper is a sign of something else , in my books . Come on , leave that for later . I got you a surprise . I thought maybe we could bake a pie together . Your favorite ... say , pecan ? I got all the good stuff . You want to whip the batter ? The batter can wait . There 's something we have to talk about . Okay , fair enough . It 's your room . - You can decorate it however you like . - It 's not that . There 's something you deserve to know . Peter ... Every living thing dies . As a scientist , that 's one of the hardest things to accept , That we try to understand the mechanisms of life . But inevitably , we can 't defeat death . No matter how much we may want to . It 's Olivia . Hey . What 's up ? Yeah . Yeah , sure . We 'll meet you outside . Something happened ? Yeah , I guess so . She 's on her way to pick us up . I 'll get my field kit . Walter ... Oh , it 's ... it 's all right , Peter . It can wait . Name 's Jill Redmond . Her purse was found outside the car . Patrolman found her with a broken neck . That 's the cause of death . But the medical examiner found this . Three puncture wounds in her soft palate . Raised a red flag in the FBI database and came up the chain to me . Shape-shifters . Well , the last time we heard of Newton and his men was in New York . They must have needed her identity for something . What else do we know about her ? We 're running a background check on her now . Well , we should send her photograph to the local and state law enforcement . And make sure they know that she just got a hell of a lot more dangerous than she looks . Look ... It 's a lemon zinger , I believe . Mm ! It 's not as good as the stuff I grow , but it 's not bad either . Well , at least she died in a happy place . I 'm not so sure . The girl 's wearing lipstick , but there isn 't any on the joint . So you think that maybe she was with somebody ? Maybe ... Maybe someone who was lucky enough to get away . Three puncture wounds to the soft palate . All clear . The rest of the place is deserted . Except for this . Walter , have you seen anything like this before ? I think I may have . It 's awfully familiar . Ah , yes . It reminds me of a beanbag chair I once owned ... 1974 . So when a shape-shifter takes a body , it 's because they want access , like , uh , the one that turned into the nurse , came after me at the hospital . Or ... Charlie . So what would the shape-shifters want with these kids ? You think that 's a good idea ? Oh , yeah , I think it 's harmless enough . Mercury . Walter , if that 's mercury , do you think that this is a shape-shifter ? I do believe it is . Isn 't that wonderful ? Good morning . We 're here to pick up a camera , an Argus ... A2B 35mm . The secretary told me there would be three of you . There was a problem . The third didn 't make it . Marvelous . That feels like an embryo , in the sense that it 's not fully developed . Developed ? Well , my theory is that this is the state in which they enter our universe . And as I 've said , being partly mechanical , they can cross over in a way that humans can 't . But , uh , this one ... seems to have failed to mature properly . Peter , would you take a look ? Shape-shifter embryo . Adorable . So the two teenagers ... maybe there were two more of these that hatched and killed them . It 's a sound proposition , but presumably the embryonic shape-shifters would have needed features , human identities . They certainly wouldn 't blend in otherwise . So then those two teenagers were just in the wrong place at the wrong time . Dunham . It 's got dozens of different amino acids , which would allow it to survive in the foreign conditions of our universe . Okay , that was Broyles . Astrid , I want to see if we can download this file from the FBI 's secure server . The African elephant is the largest ... Okay , this was recorded last night . Now just before 9 : 00 p.m. , several dozen homes , all within a half-mile radius of the warehouse , reported an ... an odd kind of interference with their broadcast signal . That 's right around when the M.E. estimated the time of death for those kids . Walter , is it possible that the shape-shifter embryo could have caused this kind of interference ? Yes . I believe the interfering signal may have originated in the alternate universe . We may be getting a glimpse into the other side . - Can we turn it up ? - Yeah . And slow it down . What is that ? It almost sounds like a language . You hear the way that some of those sounds seem to repeat ? Shape-shifters are soldiers . Soldiers always come with orders . Maybe that 's a message . I can see what the code breakers at the bureau can make of it . I got a better idea . It 's not a language . It 's math . Math ? Trigonometric equations ... in this case , a radio wave , the kind given off by a solar flare , which is interesting . Interesting how ? Our astronomical division picked up a surge in solar activity right around that time . Here 's a radio wave from last night 's solar flare . Uh , here 's your wave . But yours couldn 't have come from the sun . Well , where else could it have come from ? I don 't know . I mean , they 're not in sync . Suppose it came from a parallel universe . Wow . That ... that would de ... yeah , yeah , because in a parallel universe , time would be slightly out of sync . And the waves would be too . Hmm . What ? Imagine that these are the two universes ... slightly out of sync . But on rare occasion , they perfectly line up . According to the computer , that 's gonna happen between our universe and wherever this radio wave came from . When ? Based on this , tomorrow at precisely 3 : 31 p.m. - All right , who will be McCallister ? - That 'd be me . He 's Wu . Now everything else you need is in here . Once you 're done , we 'll reconvene at the exchange points tomorrow at exactly 20 past 3 : 00 . So that 's it ? We 're still going through with this ? Why ? You have a problem with this ? We 're a man down . Neither of us have time to handle the Verona assignment , and you don 't have a shifting device . Maybe we should abort . And I suppose you 'll be the one to give the news to the secretary . We won 't have another chance like this for seven months . So I 'll figure out how to handle Mr. Verona . You make sure you hold your end . All right ? You 're the boss . Then let 's get to work . Excuse me ... Would you happen to know where Franklin Street is ? Sure . Uh , you 're three blocks south of Franklin , so go down this street . You 'll see a convenience store . Then make a left and go two blocks west . I 'll write it down for you . Hey . Where 's Walter ? He 's out counting cars . Thinks it might help jog his memory . He says that human memory is best triggered ... When accomplishing mundane tasks , I know . Yeah , Walter 's convinced that Newton wants to build a door to the other side . If Walter can remember what he told Newton , we might be able to figure out what 's supposed to happen at 3 : 31 tomorrow . And these cars that he 's tracking down ? Well , he promised to stay off the freeway . Hey . Hey . How goes it ? Uh , Broyles sent over a list of state and local events taking place tomorrow , so ... Uh-oh . Star Trek convention at the Worcester Centrum . That 's not good . I told Walter I 'd take him . Maybe we 'll just pretend like we didn 't see that . Sure . I think I finally figured out why it is that Walter 's been acting so strange lately . He 's been carrying this picture around with him ... a family photo from when I was a kid . I think he wants to talk to me about how my mother died . About a month after I got to Europe , I got a call from St. Claire 's ... from Walter . He told me that she died in a car crash . It wasn 't a car crash . My mother committed suicide . It was the only time I spoke to him in the 17 years that he was locked up in St. Claire 's . He must have known the truth . I think , in his way , he was trying to protect me . And ... And for whatever reason , he wants to talk about it now . Peter ... You know that Walter loves you very much . Peter ! Our synthetic friends . I believe I know how to figure out what they 're up to . You remember what you told Newton ? No , but as they say in Finland ... There 's more than one way to roast a reindeer . But I 'll need some supplies . I need six car batteries , a voltage transformer , and ... and several yards of ten-gauge electrical wire . Oh ! Uh , and a corpse . Any corpse will do . But it shouldn 't be dead for more than two days . - Hello . - Hello . Can I help you ? Yes , I 'm here to see your manager , Mr. McCallister . He 's ... he 's expecting me . So , boss , you felt the need to check up on me ? Yeah . Figure out what to do about Verona ? I have some thoughts . Mr. McCallister ? Yes ? Approval for an overdraft withdrawal ? Oh , thank you . I 'll be there in just a minute . Okay . You can handle the rest . Just make sure the device remains undisturbed . Tied into the house power , and the voltmeter is ready to go . Uh , so , Walter , you 're sure that I 'm doing this right ? It 's perfect , Olivia . Just make sure they 're tightened down . Walter , you really think that this is gonna work ? There 's no reason it shouldn 't . I mean , something stopped this creature from developing , and because it 's part mechanical , if we pump it with enough electricity , we should be able to restart it , like jump-starting a car . So what 's the corpse for ? Is this embryo supposed to reanimate it ? Oh , don 't be ridiculous . B ... but , if we intend to question this creature , then it will need an identity to ... to shape-shift into . 'Cause that 's not ridiculous at all . I think we 're ready , Olivia . 80 amps . 80 amps . Hmm , not enough power , but it seems to be working . Uh , try 110 . 110 . Walter ... 140 . 140 . I think we must have blown a fuse . Oh , my . Look . Astrid , quickly ... some candles . Something 's wrong . When I cut into it , I must have damaged it . Peter , the corpse . All right , good on my side . Help me . Contact ... Newton . Thomas Jerome Newton ? Where is he ? Verona . D ... D ... Daniel ... Verona . Wait , who is Daniel Verona ? Blood type A.B. negative . Cellular polarity ... - We 're losing him . - Okay , tomorrow afternoon , what is happening at 3 : 31 ? I 'm ... sorry . Daniel Verona ? FBI . 911 . What is your emergency ? Well , there 's a man . He 's middle-aged , Caucasian . It looks like he 's having a heart attack . What is your location ? I 'm on the corner of Longwood and Huntington . What is your name , sir ? Oh , my God ! Hey , this ... this guy needs help ! Does anyone know CPR ? Someone call an ambulance , quick ! He 's not a shape-shifter . We 'll run his blood anyway , test it for mercury . Maybe we got to him before they could . Why him ? I mean , why Daniel Verona ? What could they want with him ? Medical examiner , works out of Boston General ... It 's anybody 's guess . Yeah , you too . Okay . Good night . Agent Dunham ? Yeah . Verona was a bust . Walter ... You 've been awake for two straight days . You need to get some rest . Shape-shifters ... I should have been more careful with my initial dissection . If I hadn 't caused so much damage , it would ... it could have told us everything . But you couldn 't possibly have known that . It was definitely stupid and inexcusable . Calm down . It 's gonna be okay . Okay , yeah . We 're gonna figure it out , just like we always do . Okay . Okay . - Okay ? - Hmm . I want you to get some rest , dad . I 'm gonna hit the sack . I 'll be upstairs if you need me . " Dad . " Huh ? You just called me dad . Yeah , I guess I did . Peter ! Yeah ? Newton ... I think I know what he 's planning to do . She 's here . Agent Dunham , I 'm ... I 'm sorry to get you out of bed . Oh , it 's okay . Okay . Now ... Geometry and harmonic vibrations ... that 's how we did it , Belly and I. Did what ? Sent Belly 's Monte Carlo from this universe to the other side . Now as I 've said before , the two universes vibrate at different frequencies . So we set up three harmonic rods arranged as an equilateral triangle and then activated the rods . When the car began to vibrate at just the right frequency ... That 's how we sent Belly 's car to the other side . And it 's exactly what Newton did with the building . But Newton 's attempt failed . Yes , indeed it did , b ... because the building that Newton brought over landed in a location that was already occupied by another . But I suspect that Mr. Newton has found a way around that problem , because he has something that Belly and I never had . What 's that ? Agents in both universes . Yes , Peter . So if we set up the harmonic rods in exactly the same position in each universe , like so ... And we activate the rods ... Boom . Then whatever is in the center of each triangle will simply be exchanged . Of course , that would likely require that the universes be in sync . 3 : 31 this afternoon . Okay , so , uh ... so what could Newton bring here ? Last time he brought a building , so I suppose anything he could fit inside of it ... a ... a machine . - An army . - Yes . If the triangle is large enough , that is possible . Okay , so we have roughly ten hours to figure out where the center of Newton 's triangle is . Yes . But it could be anywhere . Three points ... Newton would have to place the harmonic rods at three specific locations across the city . Okay , so that 's why Newton 's going after Verona , because Verona must have access to one of the three points . So that would suggest either Boston General Hospital or Verona 's home . Okay , so Verona lives in Beacon Hill ... 520 South Garden Street . It doesn 't matter . It 's only a couple blocks from the hospital . So for our purposes , that 's our first point . I think I might be able to help . Boston P.D. just found a corpse in Chestnut Hill Village . Three punctures to his soft palate . His name is Ben McCallister . He 's a branch manager at Pinewood Savings Bank . He was found just outside his office . Not easy to access a bank . Okay , 185 Mason Ave . Mason ... Excellent . So that 's our second point , and now we have the first leg of our triangle . We 've got more than that , son . We 're looking for an equilateral triangle , therefore , the third point ... Can only be in one of two places , right . All right , so the third point is either Arlington or ... Cedar Grove . Well , try both . See what 's in the center of each triangle . It 's either Hyde Park ... or right on the Charles River . So he 's got to be targeting Hyde Park . Is there a bridge on the Charles ? Yeah , a condemned railway bridge . Why ? Uh , the water would absorb any excess energy caused by Newton 's procedure , so he must be making the exchange on the bridge . She 's right , Peter . Uh , it 's Dunham . I think we have something . We 're all set . - Any problems ? - All good . Go deal with it , now . Are we sending anyone to look for the harmonic rods ? Agents are on their way to the morgue and McCallister 's bank in Chestnut Hill . Boston P.D. have been deployed to the Andrews Avenue bridge . What 's your status ? We 're a few minutes away . Whatever Newton 's trying to bring over , Walter thinks he can stop it . Okay , call me when you get there . Walter , how is this thing gonna work ? Vibrations are composed of shock waves , and like sound waves , they can be nullified by their opposite ... - right , like noise-canceling headphones . - Precisely . The seismograph will pick up the vibrations from Newton 's device . The laptop will calculate its opposite and transmit it to the pneumatic hammer . To send out vibrations that would cancel out Newton 's device . Of course , we have to get the hammer as close to the center of the bridge as possible , which might be dangerous . Dangerous how ? The vibrational waves that Newton will need to generate the intensity ... devastating . What do you mean , " devastating " ? I suspect it would tear a man apart . Walter , I need you to stay here and finish putting that thing together , okay ? Hey ... we need to get on that bridge . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . Uh ... I 'm with the FBI . You 're the boss . Let me just check with the sergeant . How did you know ? A cop wouldn 't call his sergeant on a cell phone . Walter ! No ! It 's 3 : 32 . Walter 's not gonna make it in time . I 'm going up there . Cover me . Hey . Peter , you need to get off this bridge . I have to put this right . I started this , I 've got to ... It 's gonna go faster if we do it together . What ? Yeah , the two on the bridge ... get them out of there . Peter and Walter are on the bridge . It 's started . Pneumatic is ready . Seismograph is ready . Cleaning up the program ! Something 's wrong ! I don 't understand . It should be working . There 's something wrong with your frequency-recognition program . But don 't worry . I can fix it . How we doing ? I need you all to get off this bridge now . Get off the bridge . No , Walter , there 's nothing else you can do . I need you to get him off this bridge . Come on , Walter . - No , no . I ... No , I ... Olivia . - Walter , come with me . Walter ... Aah ! You okay ? Welcome back . How long was I out ? Uh , about a day and a half . Here . The doctor said that you 'd be fine , but Walter was worried . I 'm fine . Is he here ? Yeah . He wouldn 't leave . He 'll want to know that you 're up . Olivia ... I 'd like to speak to him alone , if that 's okay . Sure . Peter . Oh , they told me you 'd be all right , but I was so worried , son . And ... There was another man on that bridge . When Newton 's device started to work , I saw him there ... Just walking down the bridge . He had to have been from the other side . You said the effects of Newton 's vibrations would be devastating . And ... They were . They destroyed that FBI agent . They just ... disintegrated him like he wasn 't even there . But they didn 't kill the man from the other side . And they didn 't kill me . I 'm not from here , am I ? You didn 't just open up a hole to the other side . You went through ... and you brought me back . That 's why I was able to survive Newton 's device . It 's why I can 't remember my childhood . You were dying , Peter ... It 's why my mother committed suicide . Isn 't it ? She knew ... Didn 't she ? And when I left , the guilt was too much for her to live with ... the lie . Peter , you need to understand something . I understand , Walter . I understand everything now . Son ... I am not your son . I 'd like to be alone now . Uh , it ... it would be easier if you don 't try to talk just yet , Mr. Secretary . You see , despite the preparation , crossing over is quite an ordeal on your body , and , uh , the consequences are unpredictable . This ... this should help . You should ... you should be able to sleep for a while . And hopefully , when you wake up , you 'll be stabilized . Walter , it 's 6 : 00 . Peter 's probably still sleeping . I have to go to the hospital now . Are you going to drive me , or shall I call a cab ? Hey . Walter ... Peter checked himself out of the hospital three hours ago . He isn 't at the lab , and he 's not answering his phone . He 's gone . Sync by elderman Corrected by chamallow35 Kerensky

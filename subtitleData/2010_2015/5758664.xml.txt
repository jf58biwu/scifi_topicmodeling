 The Kazakh government has announced that it 's to continue with plans to compulsory-purchase several million acres of arable land in Kazakhstan , much of it owned by China and the United States . The US has strongly condemned the move , likening it to Soviet-era renationalisation . The Kazakh president has said that , with the continuing weak prices , his nation is struggling to feed its people ... Glasses . Note pad . No pages missing . Pen . If you 're in there , she stays shackled , you understand ? I 'm Ross . Your new interrogator . I know my predecessor wasn 't gentle . I know he hurt you , Jess . And , in return , you hurt him . Hurt him ? She stuck a fucking screwdriver into his spine . I 'm not going to be like that . - Don 't . - OK . Don 't go too close . I want to see what he did to you . Can you get me a book , please ? What book would you like ? The Bible . I want to read The Bible . You have this . I sold it . It 's a graphic novel . It 's about a scientist who makes a deal with the devil . The manuscript exists , the boy knows where it is . Do you want to see my nuclear fallout shelter ? Where is Jessica Hyde ? Yesterday , I was arrested for a sex crime , today I 'm on the run from ex-government nutters who want to put out my eyes . I 'm a fucking IT consultant . I 'm Jessica Hyde . I 'm Philip Carvel 's daughter . Don 't find out the truth about our father . We need to find out why they want the manuscript . It has the identity of Mr. Rabbit . We believe it describes the molecular structure of a protein we call Janus . The purpose of Janus is to sterilise the entire human race . I destroyed your work . Janus is gone ! That 's just a bunch of old drawings done by a crazy man . Aaargh ! That 's where he hid Janus . It 's in me ! Is your mother home ? Thanks , Peter . It 's Pietre . Peter , that 's what I said . Come on , cartoons . I like cartoons . I see you two have settled in , then . Look what Peter got me . - You 've got to stop buying her things . - No , he doesn 't . - You don 't , Peter . - It 's Pietre . - Peter , that 's what I said . - Don 't tease him , Amanda . Pietre . Peter . - It 's Pietre . - Peter . You all right , Ian ? Everything ... Everything all right ? Why are you asking that ? No , no reason . - I 'm not prodding . - Prodding ? You 're not prodding ? Actually , there was something . Do you think it 's possible to actually die of boredom ? Cos I was just going to staple my own tongue . That 's how bored I am . I was going to staple my own fucking tongue in the hope that pain will give me some small reprieve from the tedium ... of IT . Do you want to talk about it , buddy ? No . No ... Because self-harm is a key indicator ... It 's not self-harm , Joe , OK ? Doing this job is self-harm . You 're not alone , Ian . My cousin ... he tried to kill himself . He was just like you . He just ... disappeared . And then we found out he 'd been in hospital and he 'd tried to ... I mean ... Once or twice , I 've found myself ... You know . Thinking about ... I 'm going to do some work now , Joe . Yeah , yeah , course . Cos I really feel like I need to , you know , get fucking cracking . Yeah . Yeah , you , er ... Yeah . welcome back . Again . Becky . Where are you , Becky ? I have this ... Jess . But I 'd like to think I don 't need it . Why are you calling me Jess ? That 's what Christos called you . So you 're trying to get into my head ? No . Just trying to connect , that 's all . And I know how alone you must feel . Your father put Janus in you , but before he did ... he made an adjustment to it . Now , we 've taken Janus from your blood . It works perfectly . We 're making it right now . Hiding it in the Russian flu vaccine that everyone is so desperate for . But we cannot see his adjustment . And we can 't release the vaccine until we know what the adjustment is . We know he told Christos . And we think ... Christos told you . So ... I would like you ... to tell me . Because there is another way , Jess . And our scientists say that , if they can cut open your brain , they 'll find it . I 'm holding them off , Jess . Why ? Why not just cut me open ? I don 't want you hurt . You are your father 's daughter . My father 's daughter ? ! He put this thing in me . I was nothing but a genetic container to him . No . You 're wrong . He loved you . Hello , matey . It 's all right . I 'm alone . I thought you was dead . Nearly . Lost the use of my arm . Nerve damage . My lung 's all messed up . I 'm not much use to anyone now . How did you find me ? Well ... it wasn 't easy . You 're being discreet . What 's in that bag ? Clothes . Bits of food . I move around a lot . Are you hungry ? What is this ? Quinoa . It 's a super-food . Yeah . Super . Still got our old bag , then ? It 's good for tools . I 'm a plumber . Nice . Nice work . Sort of thing that appeals to a meticulous mind . How long 's all this been going on ? Four months . We met in a pub . They like me . I 'm quiet . Yeah ! You certainly are quiet . Have you struggled to adjust , Arby ? I have . I know it 's odd , but ... I brush my teeth obsessively . Like the things we did are caught in me ... in my mouth or ... What about you ? No , I just brush the normal amount . Oh . I think ... we can move on , Lee . I mean ... - it 's all over now . - Over ? What , that fire ? Come on . You think a thing like that stops them ? They 're starting again . Nothing 's over . And I know things . Example ... I know they want you ... for a job . There 's someone they want got rid of . They want you to do it . But ... I 'm out , Lee . Just like you . Out ? I 'm not out . Who said I was out ? You 're never out , Arby . Not a good idea . I swear it isn 't . Hello , you . Oh . Hello . I 'm Lee . I 'm an old friend of Arby 's from the old days . Arby 's told me all about you . - Arby ? - A nickname . We used to work together . Has he not told you anything about our work together ? Tell me about it ? Mr. Mystery ? You 've got to be kidding . He does love a mystery . What 's in that bag ? - Amanda , don 't be rude . - Oh , that 's not rude . Curiosity should always be encouraged . I tell you what , Amanda ... why don 't you open it up and have a look ? What on earth is that ? Dental gas . It 's a prototype . I work for a company that sells to dentists . Pop it on the table , love . What do you do with it ? Well ... when little kids don 't look after their teeth and they get rotten , we have to make them sleep . Let 's hope we never have to use it on you , eh ? Do you want tea or anything ? Not for me , Tess , I won 't be long . I intend finishing here very soon . Oh , I just remembered where my electronic fag was . You see , all this ... It 's not for you . You know that . It 's been a lovely holiday and you 'll never forget it , or the people you met here . But it 's time to come home now , Arby . And you can never , ever ... come back . As you all now know , Corvadt has today gone into administration . But as sole manufacturer of the Russian flu vaccine , we believe that Corvadt cannot be allowed to fail . So , I have taken the decision that Corvadt will be bailed out . As of today , we are making the vaccine . And this will happen at an unprecedented pace . So , if Russian flu strikes , you will be protected . It is with this in mind , I am very pleased to introduce the new temporary CEO , a man with years of experience and someone who is intimately familiar with Russian flu ... Mr. Michael Dugdale . Oh ! There we go . Not so bad , was it ? Apart from you looking like a tit . How about you ? How are you doing ? You 're with us now . We are not fucking friends , Geoff . OK ? I don 't like you . I 'd go so far as to say I hate you . I despise you . Every time I see you , I feel physically sick . I 'm seeing this vaccine through , but that 's it , right ? You ... You remember that . A-hem ! Go home . You 're the last one here . I thought you hated this place . Hm . Joe , do you wanna go for a drink ? Pints for the lads . Hey , did you hear about Martin ? He 's going out with Leanne . What ? ! Leanne ? Do you ever think your life has become meaningless , Joe ? What if I were to tell you that I didn 't try and kill myself at all ? That there was no hospital ? What if I were to tell you that I 'd been on the run ... chased by a shadowy organisation that wanted to kill me , my friends ... and control governments and whose objective was to sterilise the world ? And I stopped them . Me . I reckon she 's just leading him on . Leanne ? ! She 's not his type . Google alert ? Grant Leetham ? Who 's Grant Leetham ? I can hear that down the street . Yeah ? I 'm being a fucking Goth . That 's what you want , innit ? That 's not even goth music ! - It 's shit . It 'll do . - And why are you talking on chatrooms ? - Grant , you 're supposed to be dead ! - No-one will believe them nut jobs . - For fuck 's sake , Grant , you can 't do this ! - I 'm dead . I 'm dead , mate ! My mum , my mates , everyone I know , they all think I fucking killed myself cos of you and that bitch Milner ! Milner is finishing off the Network . When that 's done ... Milner . Milner . Fucking Milner . We ain 't heard from her in months . She 's forgotten about us , Ian . We 've been left here to rot . I 'm fucking sick to my tits of you . I 'm going out ! - No , you 're not . - I am . Ian ... - Grant ... - Get off me ! - Agh ! For fuck 's sake ! - Ian ... Grant ... I 'm ... I 'm sorry . - I 'm sorry . Are you all right ? - You punched me . - I know , I 'm sorry . - I 'm a kid . I ... I know . I 'm fucking sorry . Grant ! Do you know what ? I 'm calling the police and telling them you touched my bollocks ! You ... paedo ! I like the new patch . Have you thought about what I said ? Yeah . Why me ? I mean ... you told me who you are . Who you really are . Why did you take that risk ? We tortured you , we disfigured you , we murdered your father , and yet in the last instance you chose to betray the people you 'd grown to love for our cause . Yeah , but am I ... Am I capable ? Of course you are . You believe in ... I 'm not talking about belief , I 'm talking about ... capacity . Look , I ... I want to help you , and I believe this is right , it 's just ... I don 't think I can . What do you see when you see me ? Milner . Letan , Mr. Rabbit , I dunno . What do you see when you see me ? I see ... I see someone ... who 's killed thousands ... who ... murders , tortures , executes innocent children without hesitation . That 's what I see . And do you think I wanted that ? Do you think I wanted to be Mr. Rabbit ? You 're capable of more than you know , Wilson , believe me . Do you recognise me ? I can see him in you . You knew my father ? I knew him very well . I made sure you survived his leaving . I have a very important thing for you to do . This man knows something . His name is Christian Donaldson . And what he knows , no-one can know . I 'm trusting you , do you see ? I want you back . If only you could 've known your father , Arby . He was incredible , he was ... My name 's Pietre . And my father wasn 't incredible . Not at all . You 're being uncharacteristically soft . He 'll do it . He 'll come back to us . But just in case , send others , too . Send a SWAT team . Make sure Donaldson 's dead . I wish Becky had taken me with her . I hate you . She was great , Becky . Yeah . She was great , Becky . - Becky ! - Agh ! It 's a long way down , Becky . I don 't think you should jump . Jesus Christ , just let me die in peace , you creepy little fuck ! This isn 't why I contacted you . I wanted your help , not your death . You don 't have to do this yet . And what do I get for my help ? Another month of life ? Six weeks if you 're generous . Just fuck off , Christian , I 'm not doing this any more . One year . A whole year . A year 's worth of Thoraxin , Becky . It works , doesn 't it ? I mean , it 's not a cure , but it 's taking care of the symptoms . And what do I have to do for it ? Nothing like last time , I promise . I 'm not asking you to get the manuscript , I 'm not asking you to betray your friends . Just help me now downstairs ... Becky . Hi . Who 's this to ? Oh , piss the fuck off ! This is a honey trap , show a bit of fucking honey ! Who is this guy again ? Tony Bradley . An utterly mediocre scientist . I went to college with him . He 's a moron . And out of nowhere he 's written the definitive book on Deel 's syndrome . I 've read it . It-It 's brilliant . So ... ? So he 's an idiot . The knowledge in that book , he 's stolen it ! Look , Becky , I 'm clever . Think how much more use that would be in my hands . And this is out the kindness of your heart , to help Deel 's victims ? No . I want to take what he 's got , write my own book and make a shitload of cash . And if I don 't help you ? Well , the NHS does some wonderful things around end-of-life planning . Right ... Excuse me . - Hi . - Oh , hi . Becky . God , you 're so funny ! - Am I ? - Yeah . Didn 't think I was ! Jesus Christ , what are you doing ? Shut up . I 've got this . Fuck ! Where did you get that ? Christian , is that you ? What have you got a gun for ? It 's for shooting people . Are you two together ? Oh , fuck , no . Not like that , we 're not . Where are you getting this ? I 've read your fucking book . You don 't know any of this . I am a respected scientist . No , you 're not . Yes , well , you 're hardly a Nobel Prize-winner , are you , Christian ? That 's because I 've got demons . You 're just a knuckle-dragger . No ! I have painstakingly and methodically researched Deel 's syndrome , and I have made ... certain leaps . And I did it on my own , just me . Get up . Me sim bokhalo . Xabe ? Jesus ! It 's like a dungeon . Are you having sex with this man ? No ! All right , look . I was in the middle of a class about five months ago and he just walked in . He started doing equations on the board . I had no idea what was going on . But the stuff was incredible . So I brought him home , gave him some food . He kept doing it . I realised it related to Deel 's . And I thought , well , it should be published . How would he know about Deel 's ? What language is that ? I ... I have no idea . He doesn 't speak English . I think his name is , er , Anton . Da ? Let 's get out of here . This doesn 't feel safe . Right , well ... Anton , come on . Let 's get you out . Right , hold his hand . I 'm going to tie your hands together . It 's inconspicuous , and it 's hard to run when you 're tied to another human being . No ! You fucking do it . Can I go ? Can I just go now , please ? Becky , will you stop messing around ? ! Right , well , you 'll have to have the gun . You are such a twat . Can I just go now , please ? We need information first , then you can go . - Wh ... ? - Mm-hm . When I first came here , they used to let me go up to another room for an hour every day . There was a window there , I could see clouds outside . They took it away because ... I hurt people . Do you like clouds ? I believe in what your father did . I believe in Janus . But am I going to sit here and tell you that what he did to you ... was right ? No . No , I 'm not . Did you want children , Jessica ? He denies you a father and then he denies you children . What kind of mother would I have been ? You 'd have been a great mother . I couldn 't have been a mother . All that love ? You 'd have been amazing . We 're running out of time , Jess . Are you ready to tell me ? Why don 't you just hurt me ? That 's not what you deserve . It just ... isn 't . Of a worldwide vaccination programme . These diseases are everywhere on the increase , and it 's now possible that TB deaths may overtake malaria deaths within five years . Er ... y-yes . Yes , that 's ... that 's , um ... bad . It 's all about transport with the vaccines . The cold chain must remain uninterrupted , and this means refrigerated trucks , ships ... These places are remote , it 's ... it 's hard . Yes . Well , well done . You 've been doing some excellent ... Ah , Mr. Gorsand , how good to see you . Geoff isn 't here because he cares about vaccines , darling . He 's here because he wants my fucking papers on board for the next election . - Ha , we 're not like that these days . - Politics doesn 't change . There 's a room nearby we can use . Why don 't you join us ? - You can wait in there . - Er , look , I think it 's about time I ... Do as you 're told , dear . Every time a new drug is developed , there are winners and losers . If you 're watching this , you 're a winner , but not everyone is so lucky . On average , vaccines reach the Third World 15 years after we get them . That 's 15 years of disease , of misery , of death . Russian flu has the potential to kill millions . But there is a vaccine . As usual , we 'll get it first , the developing world left to beg , left to die . But we want to say , " No , not this time . " V Day is an initiative started by the Rochane Foundation to get the Russian flu vaccine to everyone at the same time . 16th November . V Day . It means us waiting a few months for the vaccine , so that they don 't have to wait decades . Isn 't that worth it ? Support V Day . Say , " No , not this time . " This time , we live together . Are you fucking serious ? This ? ! We launch V Day on Wednesday . Leah 's Rochane Foundation will back the campaign , underwriting the cost for countries that can 't afford it . And how much will that be ? $ 268 billion . But that 's six times the deficit . You can 't afford that ! No NGO has anywhere near that kind of money . We have 23 billion . My husband is worth 11 and he 's leaving it all to us . He will die next week . His example will be followed . Alexander Levchenko , 23 billion , Steph Aberg , 21 billion , Tim Stanton , 18 billion . There are others . We 're harvesting the rich , Geoff . We have celebrities and NGOs ready to back us . It 's a good thing . But you 're the most important . You run the health department , and the department now owns Corvadt . If you say no-one gets the vaccine until we all do ... so be it . I can 't do that . That 's political suicide . My career will be over . How do you think you got your career ? Through talent and ability ? You 've got your career because we gave it to you . You only have one talent , Geoff , and it 's doing what you 're told . Jess ? Are you ready ? I don 't know what the adjustment is , Ross . Christos never told me . What ? No ... That can 't be . They tortured you for five months . I pretended to know . I had to , to stay alive . I want to show you what they did to me . I know you 're scared . But you must trust me . We 're running out of time , Jess . But your approach ... Your approach is different . You want to get in my head . No . No , I 'm not in your head . I know you 're not . I know you 're not , Ross . I 'm in yours . Something 's come up , I 'm off . Oh , er ... Yeah . Cool , buddy . Er ... do you mind me asking wh ... I 've found her . Becky ! I 've found her . Come on , dickhead , let 's go . Yes ! Can you understand me ? What I 'm saying ? Do you speak English ? - Will you stop fucking struggling ? ! - Can I go now ? Please ! Of course you can 't go ! I need to know what he knows about Deel 's and you 've screwed the knot up so tight we 've got to find a fucking knife . Why are you staying here ? I 'm hiding out . I felt like I was being followed . Oh , shit . Becky , can you get a knife ? Stop bloody sweating , Tony ! There 's fuck-all here . Where was she going ? There . She was going that way . Let 's be careful . Just wait here , OK ? Palpale ... ka murro trayo . Rrugiv tut , sheya . How many ? I 'll let you live . Four . - Including you ? - Yes . Thank you . Come with me or they 'll kill you . What the fuck are you doing here ? I ... I 've come to find you . Why ? What do you mean , why ? I mean , why have you come to find me ? Why do you think ? I don 't know . That 's why I 'm fucking asking you . Jesus , this is not at all going how I imagined it would . Oh , my God ! There 's one more . Wait here . What the hell is that ? Can I go now ? Can I just go now , please ? Please ... What are you doing ? Come on ! Tony ? Are you having a heart attack ? Are you having a fucking heart attack ? ! My name 's Pietre . We need to run . All of us . Right now . Jesus Christ . What the fuck was that ? - Who were they ? - I don 't know . - Grant , are you all right ? - He 's a psycho ! He killed Bejan , Alice 's mum ! He just fucking shot her ! It 's OK . I 'm not going to hurt you . I saved you . And those soldiers weren 't there to kill you , either . Then , why were they there ? They were there to kill him . Me ? What the fuck have I done ? She made the rope , plaited it from pages torn from a Bible . Then she wound it into the gate 's mechanism but we don 't know which way . Press up , down , it could release him or it could tear his head off . We can 't go in there because she 's rigged these doors onto the same circuit , and we can 't override it . If you interfere with the mechanism , the gate shuts . It 's a ... safety measure . Has she tried to get out , made any demands ? What does she want ? She doesn 't want anything . She 's lost her mind . She 's just ... not moved in five hours . Just stares at clouds . Who gave her the Bible ? What have I done to you , Jessica ? What have I done ? Glasses . Notepad . No pages missing . Pen . Sign out . You got a pen that works ?

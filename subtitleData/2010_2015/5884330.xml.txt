 [ young man ] After The Ruin , we started over , creating a new society , one of true equality . Rules were the building blocks of that equality . We learned them as Newchildren . Rules like : [ electronic voice ] Injected . My name is Jonas . I don 't have a last name . None of us did . That day , the day before graduation , I admit it , I was scared . Tomorrow we 'd be assigned our jobs , our purpose . It seemed everyone knew theirs already . Not me . I was lost . I always felt like I saw things differently , saw things other people didn 't . I never said anything . I didn 't want to be different . Who would ? - [ bell dinging ] - Jonas . I apologize , we 're late . I got Asher to come say goodbye to Teacher . I accept your apology . [ Jonas ] Asher and Fiona , we 'd been friends our whole lives . Asher was the boy who made everyone laugh . Fiona , well , she was the girl who made everyone smile . Take that back ! Whoever is listening , please , please , do not make me Vice Chancellor of Waste Management ! Please ! [ Jonas ] We lived in a world where differences weren 't allowed . There was no " popular . " No fame . No losers and no winners . Our Elders had eliminated all of that so there 'd be no conflict between us . Fear , pain , envy , hate , they weren 't words so much as sounds . Their echoes were gone , to the other side of history . I 'm asked if I should apologize for what I did . I 'll let you decide . [ Fiona ] I 'm going to miss volunteering here . [ Asher ] Oh , no . If ever there was a person born to work at the Nurturing Center ... I could be surprised , right ? Jonas , if you had to guess , of all the positions the elders picked for me ? Nurturing Center . [ clunking ] [ electronic voice ] Welcome to the Nurturing Center . [ babies fussing , crying ] I got this . I got this . - Think heavy . Think heavy . - Come on , come on . [ Fiona ] We win ! Aren 't you my chubby champion ? - Which one was heavier ? - [ Fiona ] Mine . Asher ? [ babies crying ] Father , I think Fiona put her finger on the scale . I did not . [ baby crying ] [ crying continues ] Aw , this little guy didn 't qualify for tomorrow 's ceremony . [ Father ] He 's just not strong enough to be assigned to a family yet . [ crying ] He looks so unhappy . - [ crying continues ] - Hey ... It 's okay , Jonas , you can open it . Yeah , it 's Jonas . Here , let me . [ Fiona ] Oh , There you go . There you go . [ baby quieting ] - [ whispering ] It 's okay . - Some people have it , huh ? Well , that 's just not fair . Be strong , Gabriel . You looked at his name ? Isn 't that against the rules ? Yeah , it , it is . I just thought having a name might help him grow . So I whisper it to him when no one can hear . Sometimes I call him Gabe . [ Father ] But he 's usually so restless , I , I 'm not even sure he can hear me . You okay ? Huh ? Yeah . I 'm fine . So the old man turns to the Elder and says , " Do you know who I am ? " And the Elder says , " Sir , I know you 're old , but that is no excuse for being prideful . " And then the old man says , " No , really , I 'm asking . - Who am I ? " - [ Jonas and Asher laughing ] [ Fiona ] I don 't get it . [ Asher ] " Who am I ? " like , like he forgot who he was . [ electronic chiming ] Okay , but wouldn 't the joke be better - if the old man says ... - [ Asher and Jonas ] Okay , one ... - What ? - ... two three ! - [ both grunting ] - [ both laughing ] - [ Fiona groans ] Aren 't we graduates now ? [ Asher ] You do this every time ! - Come on ! - Okay ! One , two , three ! [ shrieks ] [ laughing ] [ Asher ] There you go . [ laughing ] So , I guess this is it . The last night of our childhood . I guess everything is gonna be different . No . Tomorrow the only thing that changes is what we do . It doesn 't change who we are . Quick question : Who are we ? Friends . - [ Asher ] Friends forever . - [ Fiona ] Yes . Even when you 're both assigned to be Birth Mothers . [ Jonas ] Hey ! Well , I guess we 'll find out tomorrow , huh ? [ electronic voice ] Citizens are reminded that evening recreation will end in 30 minutes . Thank you . [ Mother ] Well , he did need to be rehabilitated . And I know he was Lily 's Teacher , but what was I supposed to do ? - [ Father ] Hmm . [ Mother ] I feel disappointment . What was the Elders ' decision ? Released to Elsewhere . Can I be " Released to Elsewhere , " Mother ? Even just for one day ? No , you 're too young , Lily Billy . Jonas , your turn for Feelings . Well , I guess I 'm sort of terrified . Precision of language . I mean anxious . When you were about to graduate , did you ever feel like there was no position meant for you ? They 've been watching since you were a Newchild . The Elders are never wrong . [ Father ] You 'll find your place . [ male voice over speaker ] Welcome , citizens , to the annual Ceremony of Advancement . Please stand by for a transmission . Good morning , Community . [ audience members in unison ] Good morning , Chief Elder . I apologize for my remote attendance . [ audience members in unison ] We accept your apology . I can 't be at every Ceremony in person . But here 's a secret : you are my favorite Community . However , because we do not lie , I readily admit I say that to every Community . [ all laughing ] [ Chief Elder ] Beginnings ... From disorder and chaos , from great suffering , great pain . From confusion and envy and hatred came a solution : Communities . Serene , beautiful places where disorder became harmony . [ chuckling gently ] Let me get through it . [ applause continues ] Oh , fine . It begins . The Ceremony . Ceremony of the Release to Elsewhere , honoring the elderly citizens who have devoted their work to the beauty and harmony of our beloved Community , and are now ready for joyous retirement to Elsewhere . Celebrating the Newchildren , proudly engineered by our esteemed geneticists . [ audience in unison ] Abigail . [ Chief Elder ] Produced by our honored Birth Mothers ... - [ audience in unison ] Aurelia . - [ Chief Elder ] ... these infants will now join their assigned family units . [ audience in unison ] Caleb . [ Chief Elder ] Reaching their halfway mark towards graduation , our Nines today receive a symbol of their developing independence and responsibility . [ applause ] Celebrating the graduates who , today , will be assigned their positions in our Community . [ whispering ] Good luck . [ whispering ] You , too . All of your training has been to help you fit in , to curb any impulse that may set you apart from others , but today , we honor your differences , for they have determined your future . Here are the Leaders and the Teachers and the Workers and Birth Mothers of tomorrow , and I think we 're in very good hands . Number one , Madeline . [ applause ] Birth Mother . Thank you for your childhood . Number two , Ross . Instructor of the Middles . Thank you for your childhood . Number 51 , Asher . Unruly , careless . Sometimes those most in need of responsibility learn best by being the practitioners of it . Drone Pilot . Thank you for your childhood . You can keep it ! [ laughter ] Thanks ! [ Chief Elder ] Number 53 , Ayanda . Recreation Leader . Thank you for your childhood . Number 54 , Kathy . They skipped Jonas . Thank you for your childhood . Number 78 , Lloyd . Geneticist . Thank you for your childhood . Number 83 , Yara . [ Chief Elder continues indistinctly ] Number 96 , Chris . Food maintenance . Number 100 , Quinn . Caretaker of the Old . Number 104 , Fiona . From the beginning , it was clear Fiona flourished working with Newchildren . Fiona ... Nurturer . Thank you for your childhood . Number 105 , Lucia . Instructor of the Twelves . Number 120 , Jack . Department of Justice Assistant . [ continues indistinctly ] ... Nutrition Technician . Thank you for your childhood . Number 150 , Pierre . Groundskeeper . Thank you for your childhood . You feel I have made a mistake . I apologize to my Community . [ audience in unison ] We accept your apology . Number 52 , please step forward . Jonas has not been assigned a position . Jonas has been selected . We were not hasty this time . We could not afford another failure . Jonas possesses all four attributes : intelligence , integrity , courage , and one I can name , but I cannot describe the capacity to see beyond . But I must warn you , your training involves pain . Pain far beyond anything we know . Are you strong enough ? Do we think Jonas is brave enough ? [ applause ] Jonas , you have been selected as our next Receiver of Memory . Thank you for your childhood . Jonas ... [ Elder and audience chanting ] Jonas.Jonas.Jonas.Jonas. Jonas.Jonas.Jonas.Jonas. Jonas.Jonas.Jonas. Jonas.Jonas. Jonas.Jonas.Jonas. [ chanting continues , growing louder ] [ chanting continues ] [ Lily ] Help me up , please . [ Mother ] Okay , this foot , yeah . That one , you got it . Sit back , sit back . Is Jonas now more powerful than you ? - [ Mother ] Shh . - What did the Chief Elder mean when she said , " We cannot afford another failure " ? Well , ten years ago , the Receiver ... We do not speak of it . You 've been greatly honored . You 've got it ! Go , go , go ! You 've got it , got it , got it ! - I can do it . - I should probably catch Lily . - [ Mother ] Good ! - [ Lily ] I can ride ! [ Mother ] Good , Lily ! [ Giver ] Receiver of Memory . Five rules . One : Report directly to the Receiver of Memory for your training . After training , return immediately to your dwelling . [ Giver ] Two : From this moment , you are exempt from all rules governing rudeness . You may ask any question . Three : Aside from your daily injection , you may not receive other medicines , especially those for pain . [ electronic voice ] Injected . S-7-5-2 . [ Giver ] Four : You may not discuss your training with anyone . Ever . Yours look so important . I don 't know . I stick out . Well , yeah , there 's only one Receiver of Memory . Two . What did they say again ? You have the capacity to see beyond ? [ chuckles softly ] Yeah . Can 't wait to hear every single detail . [ Giver ] Five : You may lie . [ Jonas ] Asher and I , we used to dare each other to get close to his place . It was built right on the Edge . We 'd all heard of people getting lost to the Edge , never to be seen again . And yet , here I was , being told that I 'd have to get close to it every day , for the rest of my life . [ electronic voice ] Welcome . Uh , um , hi . - I 'm Jonas . I 'm ... - Please gaze at the sensor . [ clicks , whirrs ] [ beeps ] Welcome , Receiver of Memory . [ door creaking ] [ door creaking ] [ Giver ] They 're called books . Your books . - [ Jonas ] My name is ... - I know who you are . Of course . I apologize . [ sighs ] I apologize . Don 't say that . " I apologize . " Don 't apologize to me ever again . Not here . We haven 't the time . " I apologize . " That 's an automatic pleasantry . It doesn 't mean anything . I apologize . I 'm sorry . I mean ... We are here for only one purpose . Simply stated , although it isn 't really simple at all , I will transmit to you all the memories that I hold within me . Memories of the past . I would be very interested to learn about your life . No , no . Not ... Not my life . You will learn the secret history of the world . Before me , before you , generations ... Back and back and back . When things were different , when there was more . More ? The chair . You see , no one in our Community has any memory of the past . Only me . When the ... Elders need guidance on matters that are beyond their experience , I provide wisdom . That is now your role . To provide guidance in the present using memories of the past . Move closer . Where to begin ? Move closer . Closer . There is no way for me to prepare you for what I 'm going to do now . You can take comfort in knowing you are completely helpless . [ sighs ] If any of this proves too much for you , tell me immediately . I just have ... [ laughs ] [ distorted exhale ] [ chuckles ] [ exhales ] [ choir singing faintly ] [ choir ] ♪ Holy night ♪ All ♪ - [ rapid thumping ] - [ gasps ] That was ... It was ... How did that happen ? What do you mean , how ? It happened . But it 's impossible . And yet , it happened . Well , why ? Why don 't we have ... Th ... That thing ? Go on . The memories , they give you the word . It 's not a " thing . " It 's ... - Sled . - Sled . And the ... [ laughs ] - Snow . - Snow . Did my parents have them ? Did you ? No , no . It 's a very distant memory . Simply stated , there is no snow because of climate control . But why don 't people know about them ? I mean , what 's so dangerous about the memory of a sled ? What 's so dangerous ? Mm ... for a sled , you need snow . Snow is cold . Cold destroys crops . Which meant farmers couldn 't farm . Unpredictable weather , hills , mountains , made it difficult to transport food . Then we had hunger , starvation , famine . Everything is connected , everything is a balance . With good there is always bad . - The two ... - Show me more . Let 's go for a walk . A real one , with your legs . At the bottom of the hill , I saw something . Like a place . - Home . - Home . Yes . Home ? Like a dwelling ? - [ man ] Receiver . - [ man ] Afternoon . No . It is different . A dwelling is not a home . A home is more . [ Jonas ] Your instructions said I can lie . Do you lie ? All the time . Mostly for personal amusement . But I won 't lie to you . How do I know that 's not a lie ? [ chuckles ] There was someone else before me . What happened to them ? One more question . If I 'm now the Receiver , what does that make you ? Well , then that must make me ... The Giver . So , how was it ? It was good . What 'd you do ? We just talked . What else ? That 's it . - You seem different . - How do you mean ? [ indistinct voices nearby ] - [ baby crying ] - He can 't settle down , no matter what I do . And you said you 'd look after him . - [ Father ] I know , I know . - [ woman ] I apologize . [ Father ] I accept your apology . - Thank you , Dinah . - Thank you . - [ baby crying ] - Hey . [ continues crying ] Gabriel ? How does Jonas know the child 's name ? Jonas met Gabriel the other day . [ Lily ] Look at him ! He 's so cute ! - [ Lily ] Hello . Hi . - Would you like to issue me a warning , Director of Justice ? It 's just for a while , Mother . Till the little guy catches up . I think we 're all in agreement that he sleeps in my room . [ Mother ] Only if the Elders say it 's okay . [ Lily ] They will . [ Father ] Yeah . Lily , give me your Comfort Object . Come on , Lily . It 's time for bed . - Look at this . - [ Lily ] Bye , baby . This is a mythical creature called a hippo . And it 's incredibly fast , because it has two , three , four , five legs . [ Jonas ] We had the same mark . I almost didn 't need to see his to know . But I felt it . - [ panting ] Felt that one day , Gabriel would be chosen , too . A hippo , Gabe . [ chuckles ] Yeah . [ insect buzzing ] [ buzzing continues ] [ buzzing stops ] Ow ! That 's the pain they all talk about . No . Not even close . Did you ... It had a face . Wait , was that thing alive ? Don 't skip ahead . Did you notice anything about it ? Yes . It hurt . No . Any quality ? Well , maybe . I think I saw it in my friend Fiona 's hair . My first was yellow . [ chuckles ] If you thought the sled was special ... [ rapid thumping ] [ gasps ] [ gasps ] Oh , whoa ! It 's red . - Just like her hair . - Yes . [ Giver ] There 's red , green , blue , many different colors . You 'll see them all in time . When our people , they chose to do away with all of them , color , race , religion , they created Sameness . If we were different , we could be envious , angry , or resentful , consumed with hatred . We need Sameness . Don 't you think ? Oh , I completely agree . But still ... It 's all so beautiful . [ voice-over ] They 'd always said Elsewhere was so far away , but it wasn 't . It was right there . Close enough to touch . Jonas ? Have you fallen ? Do you need immediate help ? - No . I was just ... - [ Fiona laughs ] What 's going on with you ? Nothing is going on with me . No , you 're right , it 's totally normal to lie in the grass and stare at the sky . No , I was just ... You 're seeing something , aren 't you ? Can 't you tell me ? Give me your hands . [ Jonas ] What do you see ? - Oh , my goodness . - You see it ? [ Fiona ] Yes . It 's water . No , come on , concentrate . Um ... Hi . Jonas was just teaching me about his training . As you can see , it 's incredibly interesting . Can 't be half as great as mine . Care to have your minds blown ? [ whooshing ] [ Fiona ] Whoa ! Do you know how to fly those ? Absolutely . Sort of . I 'm learning . When I 'm flying , looking down at everything , it 's like I 'm seeing things for the very first time . You get to fly into Elsewhere ? Oh , yeah . Once , when I was looking at that mist , even though they tell us there 's nothing close to the Edge , I thought I saw a tree out there somewhere . [ Asher ] Well , don 't get too excited . I 've actually seen Elsewhere . It 's just mostly our farms , weird rocks , that kind of stuff . What 's weird about them ? There 's these two huge rocks leaning against each other , making a kind of triangle . Hey , it 's kind of like our triangle . What 's past there ? Don 't know . We 're not allowed to fly past that . So many secrets . [ Asher ] So what are your secrets ? [ Jonas ] Uh , nothing . What do you mean , " Uh , nothing " ? You 're Receiver of Memory . Maybe I can show you . - Okay , grab a tray . - [ Asher ] What ? Bring it over to the solar panel . Come on . Now this might seem a little funny , but you got to trust me . Okay , sit down on the tray . - Careful . - You 're not gonna ... - What , you 're scared ? - I 'm scared of nothing . I don 't know , it 's just ... It 's against the rules , Jonas . Since when do you care about the rules ? Actually , I have auxiliary training . I 'll see you guys . [ Fiona ] Look who grew up , but lucky for you , I haven 't . [ chuckles ] Okay ? Now , go ! [ Fiona screams ] [ Jonas shouts happily ] [ yells ] [ both yelling ] [ chuckles ] Put your heels down to slow it ! [ heels squeaking ] [ laughing ] I think your training might be a bit - more fun than mine . - [ electronic voice ] Please stand by for a Community announcement . Citizens are reminded that it is impolite to touch community members outside your family unit . Thank you . [ Giver ] He 's punctual . - He 's inquisitive . - [ Chief Elder ] How inquisitive ? He 's interested in his position . Then why is he breaking the rules ? He has been observed trying to share his training with his former classmates . That always happens . [ Giver ] But it 's an impossible experiment . Even I tried to share the memories back when I was in training ... If you remember . So , forget about it . I don 't tell you what to do in your position , so don 't tell me . I apologize , but isn 't that what 's happening now ? Your apology is accepted , but you are being careless . [ whispers ] You 're moving too fast . We both know what happened ten years ago with the girl . The girl had a name . You think I don 't remember her name ? I know you feel her loss . The boy must hold in the pain . Don 't fail us again . You want me to read all these ? Hmm . What 's this ? " One day you shall meet a boy who answers to the name of Jonas . " " He shall be the most powerful of all the Receivers . " Wait . That says ... Don 't be gullible . Another trick ? Actually , no . It 's some kind of map . The Triangle of Rocks ! Hey , that 's real , my friend Asher saw it . Look at all these towers . What were they for ? How did your friend see the Triangle of Rocks ? He 's a pilot . He told me he saw it . What 's past there ? A mystery . [ Jonas ] " Boundary of Memory " ? Is that what they built so the memories would only stay within you and me ? Let 's move on . Wait . That boundary is meant to keep memories in . So if a Receiver crosses it , does that mean the memories get set free ? Perhaps . Perhaps if you or I crossed it , everyone could feel those memories again . So , what am I seeing today ? Nothing . - [ whirring , clacking ] - You 're seeing nothing today . We 've already covered " seeing beyond . " There is also such a thing as " hearing beyond . " A table ? All the food would slide to the floor . Now , don 't judge me . [ chuckles ] I 'm not very good , even though I had a very good Teacher . [ playing notes in minor key ] Music . [ plays flat note ] Well , music when I hit the right keys . [ playing notes in minor key ] [ playing melancholy song ] Just like music , there 's something else you can 't see with your eyes . Something that lives deep inside you . Something those morning injections take away . But I thought the injections are for our health . No , they remove something . What ? Emotions . [ tempo increases ] You mean like feelings ? Feelings are just fleeting . On the surface . But emotions , they 're very deep , primal . They linger . Now , Jonas you might not understand where you are or what 's happening , but don 't think about what you 're seeing . Listen . Listen to what 's calling from inside . [ lively music playing ] [ laughter , lively chatter ] [ man ] A beautiful wedding ! [ tingling ] [ lively music continues ] [ crowd cheers ] [ panting ] Why would anyone want to get rid of this ? Good question . - [ Jonas humming ] - [ Gabriel cooing ] What are you doing ? Take my hand . Ready ? [ continues humming ] You ready for the fast part ? - [ humming faster ] - [ Lily laughing ] And turn ! Spin ! What are you doing with her ? Jonas says it 's called dancing . [ both laugh ] [ electronic voice ] Please stand by for a transmission . I apologize for my intrusion . [ family ] We accept your apology . I just wanted to say hello . Hello . I 'm Lily . Yes , I know . You 're a Nine now , isn 't that right ? - Mm-hmm . - [ Gabriel crying ] Lily , I think it 's time for school . - We should probably get going . - Hello , Jonas . Hello . How is your training ? [ electronic voice ] Injected . Fine . I am concerned about the Receiver . [ electronic voice ] Injected . Many years ago , there was an incident . What kind of incident ? Living alone in a building on the Edge can isolate a person . I 'm concerned that the Receiver is becoming reckless . Are you being properly prepared ? I think so . You 're focused ? Perhaps you 're spending too much time with friends from your childhood . I 'm focused . Jonas , what do you and the Receiver actually do ? My rules say I 'm not allowed to share . She is the Chief Elder . Jonas , she only wants to help . You 're right . But you can 't tell the Receiver I told you . You have my word . We sit in chairs and don 't talk all day long . And then when time is up , I come back here , and in the morning , I do it all again . I apologize , but I 'm late . Your apology is accepted . Goodbye , Mother . [ electronic voice ] Injected . He 's not usually like this . I 'm surprised you 're not more worried about him . Were he my responsibility , I would be . [ Jonas ] We 'd been told the Chief Elder knew everything . Things nobody else did . [ playing didgeridoo ] But I had learned that knowing what something is , is not the same as knowing how something feels . [ laughs ] You get to be the very best , the last one at the top of the mountain , gasping for air , having survived , and be alone . Be curious . - [ Jonas ] I got lost . - [ crowd cheering ] The good kind of lost . I saw sights and sounds I had no words to describe . [ laughter ] Faces with flesh of all different colors . I felt so alive . This was forbidden ? I didn 't know what to think , what to believe . Have faith , the Giver told me . He said faith , that was seeing beyond . He compared it to the wind , something felt but not seen . Don 't accept ... [ chuckles ] What is the truth just because it 's coming from someone you respect . [ Jonas ] I feel completely stupid . - I have a weird feeling . - Weird ? - It tingles in your hands . - Yes . Memories are not just about the past , they determine our future . You can change things . You can make things better . [ Jonas ] It was life . It just seemed more complete . The more I experienced , the more I wanted . [ Giver ] Once , there were other living things . But unlike us , they knew who their mothers and fathers were . They had Joy and they had pain . I can 't prepare you for what 's going to happen ... You don 't need to warn me every single time . No , Jonas , you don 't understand . There was tremendous cruelty . Giver , I 'm not a kid any more . Show me . [ man ] That 's $ 250,000 of ivory . Come on ! - Come on ! - [ gunfire ] Got him ! [ Jonas ] No , stop ! Stop ! [ sobbing softly ] Stop . [ Gabriel crying ] [ crying continues ] Gabe . Hey , hey . Hey , hey , Gabe . Gabe . If I tell you a secret , do you promise not to tell anyone ? [ crying stops ] [ chuckles ] I 'll take that as a yes . This Comfort Object is not a hippo . It 's an elephant . And once , it was real . And it was beautiful . [ birds chirping ] [ elephant trumpets ] [ heart beats ] [ elephant trumpets faintly ] [ electronic voice ] Citizens are reminded that sleep period commences in 15 minutes . Thank you . [ laughter , lively chatter ] [ laughing ] [ Jonas ] It was like a memory , but Fiona was there . You had a dream . - A what ? - A dream . A combination of reality , fantasy , emotions and what you had for dinner . [ chuckles ] You 've stopped taking your injections , haven 't you ? The emotion was so strong . And at the wedding , everyone all together , laughing and dancing . The old with the young , the bride and the groom , there was something there . But different to what we have . Yes . We don 't have that any more . What do you mean by " that " ? Well , I 'm talking about what you feel for someone else . And the mind can 't explain it and you ... You can 't make it go away . What is it ? Love . It 's called love . Love . Oh , hi . Hi . So what 's new ? [ chuckles ] What 's new with you ? What 's ever new ? Why are you being weird ? I 'm not . I 'm just ... I 'm just ... Hold on to the hippo , Gabe ! Hold on ! Father , do you love me ? [ Mother ] Jonas , precision of language . Please . What does " love " mean ? - [ Gabriel crying ] - I got him , Lily . Jonas used a word so antiquated that it no longer has any application . - Okay ? - Okay , If you asked , " Do you enjoy me ? " the answer is certainly yes . Or do Mother and I take pride in your accomplishments ? Well , of course we do . Do you understand ? Yes . I think I finally do . [ crying loudly ] Hey ! Hey , Gabe ! - Ah ! - [ Cooing ] Ah . Hmm . [ laughs ] Boop-ah ! Boop-ah ! - Boop-ah ! - [ laughs ] [ whispers ] I love you , Gabriel . [ cooing ] [ dog squealing ] Whoa ! Ho , ho , ho ! [ cooing ] [ squeaking ] [ child laughing ] [ cooing ] Giver , you were right ! I asked my family about love and ... Get down ! Get down ! Giver ! They 're in the trees ! They 're in the trees , Robbie ! Get down ! Get down ! Robbie , get down ! - Robbie , get down ! - Stay down ! - It 's an ambush ! - I can 't see them , man ! [ rapid gunfire ] - They 're in the trees . - [ men shouting ] Stay down ! [ frantic radio chatter ] - Medic ! - [ rocket whooshing ] [ grunts ] [ gunfire continues ] Robbie . Robbie . - There 's women firing on us . - Robbie . [ Man on radio ] Listen , I 'm certain they 're firing on us . [ gunfire continues ] [ men screaming ] [ grunts ] - [ yelling ] - [ gasping ] [ heart beats ] [ panting ] Jonas . What ... No . I 'm sorry , Jonas . How did people do that ? I didn 't mean for you to receive that . Not for years . Don 't let this turn you away . I 'm not strong enough . Of course not yet ! But , Jonas , this is what we need to know so we can advise . I can 't . I 'm sorry . I just can 't . Jonas ! Jonas ! Jonas ! Come back ! Please ! Come back inside ! [ Giver ] Let me explain it ! [ girl ] When you see something like that , there 's no explanation . Rosemary , promise me you 'll come back tomorrow . Rosemary ! [ voice-over ] Promise me . [ children laughing ] [ playful chatter ] [ faint gunfire ] Hey , Jonas . Come on . You 're just in time . - [ girl shrieks , laughs ] - [ faint screaming , gunfire ] [ Jonas ] I didn 't ever want to go back . I didn 't want the wisdom , didn 't want the pain . I wanted my childhood again . Scraped knees and ball games . Back then , we 'd played war . But war was real . The Elders understood that . They 'd erased it from our world . Maybe they were right . [ children continue laughing ] [ cooing ] - Could you watch over Harry for me ? - Of course . [ Fiona ] Hey , what 's wrong ? Nothing . I know you . You do , do you ? Yes . What do you think would happen if you skipped your morning injection ? If you skipped it . Then the sensor would blink and remind me that I forgot it . No , I don 't mean if you forgot . I mean , what do you think would happen if you chose not to be injected ? Jonas , I thought something was wrong . There is something wrong . Everything is wrong . I quit . Fiona , I 'm done being the Receiver . Tomorrow morning , skip your injection . What ? You quit ? Prick your finger and put a little blood on this apple . No , you can 't quit . If you quit your position , you get sent to Elsewhere . When you leave in the morning , put the apple over the sensor . It 'll find your blood and think it 's your hand . Stop , you 're scaring me . Fiona , I need you to do this . I need you to feel what I know it 's ... Jonas . An apple wouldn 't even work . I 've been doing it for months , and it 's worked every single time . Don 't quit . You can 't leave . I don 't think I can go back to that place . You will if you want me to do this . Okay . Fine . But tomorrow after work , meet me in the triangle . [ Jonas ] I wanted to share it with her . Not all of it . The good things . Was I wrong to want that ? I thought about her now , all the time . [ door closes ] - [ Rosemary ] Hello ? - [ melancholy song playing ] I have something to show you . [ melancholy song continues ] Come here . Who are you ? Come over and try this . - Me ? - [ Giver ] Me ? [ Rosemary ] Yeah . I want to teach you . You 've come back . Where did you learn that ? From the memory you gave me . [ Giver ] And you can just play it ? Mm-hmm . That 's beautiful . - [ Jonas ] Who 's that ? - Thanks . - This is Rosemary . - I 'll show you . The previous Receiver . - See ? - She 's the one they all talk about . [ humming to music ] She no longer exists . Remember ? [ continues humming ] Except here . And in my memories . [ humming ] She was in training only two short months . ♪ Watch how my fingers move ♪ And like you , she wanted to experience , well , everything . I only gave her pleasant , beautiful memories . Three , four ... She fought me . - Don 't protect me . - No ! Don 't show me a map and then not give me all the memories . I thought we were gonna help . We will , but we must move slow . Show it to me . You gave her war ? [ Giver ] I gave her the memory of a child ... A child taken from her mother . I gave her loss . Too soon . You 're gonna get the hang of this . The light went from her eyes . [ humming ] The next morning , without telling me , she went to the Chief Elder and asked to be Released . So she was Released ? And now lives in Elsewhere ? [ device chimes ] [ electronic voice ] Yes , Receiver ? I would like to see this morning 's Release . [ electronic voice ] Thank you for your instructions . [ baby crying ] - [ Dinah ] There , there . - That 's my father . This one is heavier . [ Jonas ] More twins . Great . - Watch . - [ Father ] Oh , good . For a moment , I thought they 'd be exactly the same . Here we go . Then we 'd have a problem . [ softly ] Okay , okay . Thank you , Dinah . - Yes , yes , yes , yes . - And you , only one unit less . [ Father coos ] [ baby crying ] [ crying continues ] [ crying stops ] Oh , I know it hurts , I know . I know , I know . But I have to use a vein , and the ones in your arms are too teeny weenie . Almost , almost ... Done . That wasn 't so bad now , was it ? That 's death . He doesn 't know what he 's doing . Doesn 't know what he 's doing ? He killed him . But he doesn 't know what it means . Just like you didn 't . Neither did Rosemary . How can he not see the baby isn 't moving ? Doesn 't that tell him something is wrong ? The young and the old are killed . You 're friend , Fiona , she will soon be trained to Release as well . That 's a lie . She 'd never do that . If Fiona understood ... We are the only ones who understand it . Then it 's our fault . You and me and all the Receivers back and back and back and back and back . There has to be a way to show them , to give them the memories so they can understand . - Yes . - Because if you can 't feel , what 's the point ? But what can you do ? [ electronic voice ] Citizens are reminded that evening recreation will end in 30 minutes . Thank you . Did it work ? I don 't know how long it takes for the injections to leave you , whether a day was long enough or ... Why did I do this , Jonas ? On the walk here , I was thinking of how I would scold you . How I would say , " Oh , it 's fine for you to break the rules because you 're chosen . " When I thought about telling you , I just , I ... I began to think about you . [ gasps softly ] Is this okay ? Do you feel anything ? [ Fiona ] It feels like ... [ Jonas ] Fiona , - what do you feel ? - I don 't know . I don 't have the words to describe it . Warm ? Does it feel warm ? Warm ? Does it feel nice ? [ gasps ] No , um ... I , I 'm on night shift . I need to ... I don 't feel right , Jonas . I need to go and get my injection . I need to go to work . What was that ? Fiona , there is more . So much more . [ Jonas ] I remembered it now . I had dreamed of her . When I was younger . I told my parents . " It was the Stirrings " , they said . Everyone had them . Medication would stop them . Nothing that couldn 't be fixed . Precision of language . And Teacher said , " That 's right , Lily . " Very good . Jonas . Just in time for Feelings . - Lily was telling us how she ... - Where 's Gabe ? Uncertain was returned to the Nurturing Center . What happened ? Well , he failed his Test of Maturity . Again . I couldn 't ask for another extension , so I 'll have to Release him to Elsewhere . Release him ? Well , we certainly gave it our best try , didn 't we ? But he 's family . Precision of language , please . [ Father ] Sit down . Eat with us . I just need to rest for a while . [ Jonas ] I hadn 't been wrong . This was wrong . They hadn 't eliminated murder . They 'd brought it home . They just called it by a different name . Father , he didn 't know any better . I did . [ tires scraping ] Jonas , what are you doing ? It 's against the rules to leave your community this late . Asher , there 's something I have to do that is right , but is sort of against the rules . If it 's the right thing to do , how can it be against the rules ? There are things that I 've learned that you don 't know that you can 't know , - not because it 's your fault ... - Jonas , you need to go back to your family unit . But that 's the point . It isn 't my family , and neither is yours . - Asher , I got to go . - Jonas , listen . - Get out of my way . - Jonas , stop ! [ grunting ] Giver ! Giver , wake up . I 'd have to be sleeping to wake up . Something can be done . Something can be done . What are you proposing ? All the memories back and back and back can be returned . I need to leave the Community . I need to find the Boundary of Memory . And then ? And then cross it . - No more discussions . - Slowly . Gabe is in danger . - Slowly . - I can 't wait any more . Something must be done . If you had that map , then why didn 't you try to leave ? I was waiting for someone like you . You are the reason we have a chance . So , the plan will be for you to go and for me to stay . If you did cross this Boundary , [ sighs ] and if the memories were set free , all of the pain that you felt , all the confusion , the chaos , it would all return . So you 'd stay to help them ? Yes . And for my daughter . It 's what she would 've wanted . Your daughter ? Rosemary . Now , your friend . If he truly saw the Triangle of Rocks ... Bring up Jonas 's activity for the past year as well . So Asher came directly to you ? Yes . What was Jonas 's disposition at evening meal ? Dissatisfied . Anxious . Indignant . Set up a communication with the Receiver of Memory . We 're not permitted to see into the Receiver 's residence . We can only transmit . Well , then we shall only transmit . [ Giver ] If you go , head towards the Triangle , away from the other Communities . That will lead to the Boundary of Memory . [ electronic voice ] Please stand by for a transmission . I apologize for the intrusion . I accept your apology . [ Chief Elder ] We have a problem . The Receiver-in-Training is missing , and he physically attacked his friend , Asher . He did ? That 's serious . Do you know where Jonas is ? I do not . [ beeping and trilling ] Well , thank you very much for helping us to narrow down the possibilities . [ Giver ] I will contact you if he comes here . [ Chief Elder ] Only if it 's not an imposition . Thank you . [ softly ] He 's lying - Talk ! They 're going to kill Gabe . I 'm leaving , I 'm leaving tonight , and I 'm going to take him with me . Jonas , not yet you 're not ready . When they decided to kill Gabe , they decided I was ready . I like this map . Don 't mess it up . I 'll be wanting it back . You don 't mind if I accelerate your training a bit , do you ? You 'd think for someone who is the keeper of emotions , that I 'd be better at ... Well ... I love you , Jonas . [ chuckles ] There . There it is . You have the courage . - Let me give you the strength . - Can I just ... [ Chief Elder ] Attention all Community residents , the Receiver-in-Training has been reported missing from his dwelling . Please , be alert . He may be in danger . [ Mother ] The Group One will start from the Edge and work inward . And then Group Two from the center out . No , no , like this . [ electronic voice ] Welcome to the Nurturing Center . - Shall I convene the Elders ? - Yes . [ babies crying ] Jonas ! I heard an alert . What 's going on ? Hey , where 's Gabe ? Is he here ? - Is he in one of these ? - If he 's back , then he 'd be with the Uncertains on a restricted floor . Show me where . Fiona , please . They 're downstairs . Come on . Jonas was chosen for the most important position in our Community . He was asked if he were strong enough . It turns out he was not . [ Chief Elder ] Instead , he is a rebel who must be stopped by you . When you find him , take him . Gabe is in danger . Jonas , he 's fine , I 'll show you . No , he 's not fine . He should be here . Fiona , I 'm leaving tonight . Leaving ? What do you mean ? I 'm taking Gabe . We 're leaving the Community . I want you to come with us . [ baby crying ] [ nurturer ] There you go . There you go . [ shushing ] [ Fiona ] [ over speaker ] I don 't have the words to describe it . Fiona , there is more . So much more . What are they doing ? [ Jonas ] Fiona , what do you feel ? [ Fiona ] I don 't have the words to describe it . [ electronic voice ] Attention , Nurturers . Please secure your work area and immediately report to the Newborns Nursery to allow for a security search procedure . Promptly report all sightings at the nearest security kiosk . Thank you . [ baby crying ] Fiona , we got to go now . You , me and Gabe . Jonas , I can 't . What about my family unit ? The other Newchildren ? I can 't leave them . [ Jonas ] This is the only way . This is the only way to make everything okay . I can 't go . When I get there , you 'll understand . I 'll come back for you . Jonas ! [ guard ] We 're checking the Nurturing Center . Come back . Now go , Jonas ! [ alarm blaring ] Please ! Stop ! She 's in corridor three ! [ babies crying , alarm continues ] [ gasping ] [ gasping ] [ gasping ] [ motorcycle vroom ] [ airplane swoosh ] [ swishing ] [ electronic voice ] Subject lost to the Edge . Search terminated . And I asked why he was out so late . He seemed angry . I didn 't understand why , but I wanted to help him . He hit me , and at first ... I can tell why you 've been acting this way . Your injection levels are extremely low . I can correct this . Friends forever , right ? [ Mother ] And then we will address what 's happened . [ Jonas ] When I went over the Edge , we shouldn 't have made it . This was a miracle . The Giver had talked about them . He told me I could draw strength from the memories . I knew by giving them to Gabe , I could protect him . Prick your finger and put a little blood on this apple . When you leave in the morning , put the apple over the sensor . I 've been doing it for months , and it 's worked every single time . What has he taught you ? This is the only way . This is the only way to make everything okay . Gabe is in danger . What they 're gonna do to him is really bad . I want you to come with us . When I get there , you 'll understand . I 'll come back for you . Yes . [ Zapping ] [ whispering ] Careful . Careful . I apologize for failing again . I don 't think you failed . I think you succeeded with your plan . Ever since the girl was Released , you haven 't been the same . I genuinely hoped Jonas would help you . You 'd have a fresh start . The two of you would work together . Which , it seems , you have . We will find Jonas . - [ Zapping ] - [ Giver cries out ] [ electronic voice ] Jonas , our Receiver of Memory , lost to the Edge . [ audience ] Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas ... How do they know Jonas is gone ? We must not say his name any more . I Will . You have to be quiet now , Lily . Jonas , Jonas ... And a hippo is really an elephant . Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas , Jonas ... [ whispering ] What I 'm about to tell you , you must never repeat to anyone . I don 't believe Jonas is Lost . But the Ceremony of Loss ? A charade . I don 't expect you to understand , but you must know that Jonas has become dangerous . He must be stopped . He must not get beyond the Triangle of Rocks . What do you want me to do ? You know Jonas . I want you to find him . And then ... I want you to lose him . [ crow cawing in distance ] [ indistinct radio chatter ] [ beeping ] [ whooshing ] [ beeping ] [ indistinct radio chatter continues ] [ whispers ] Jonas . - What are you doing ? - Asher , please , let us go . I can 't . I 'm supposed to ... To what ? To lose you . [ panting ] Asher , if you are my friend , if you ever were my friend , can you please somehow trust me ? Trust me now . [ Gabriel crying ] I do trust you , Jonas . Come on , please . Jonas . [ gasps ] [ Chief Elder ] You found him . I did . For the good of all of us , I beg you , finish this . It 's finished . [ Gabriel crying ] Hey - It 's okay . [ insects buzzing , birds screeching ] [ voice-over ] Nothing the Giver had shown me had prepared me for the voices in my head , screaming at me to stop . But I knew Fiona would be punished for helping me , Asher , for letting me go . The only way to help them , - to keep them alive , - [ thunder rumbling ] Was to get to the Boundary , if it even existed . I strengthened Gabe with memories of having enough and knowing joy . It was the memory of Fiona that kept me going . [ beeps ] Fiona ? I 've taken care of everything . We 've arranged for your Release . There 'll be a nice ceremony . Now , you get some rest . - I felt things . - What ? I know that there 's something more . - Fiona ... - Something missing from our lives . No , not missing . Something that has been stolen from me and from you . I don 't know what it is exactly , but Jonas does . I have felt things , and they were warm , and they were nice . They were beautiful . I have felt things . I have felt things . [ crying ] I have felt things . [ leaves rustling ] [ wind whistling ] [ wind whistling ] [ panting ] Where is the tower , Gabe ? The tower should be here . [ gasps ] [ low , indistinct conversation ] You can stop this . Stop what ? If you don 't want to see it , sit down with the other Elders . Close your eyes . [ electronic voice ] Ceremony of Release to Elsewhere . [ Father ] Hello , Fiona . [ clicking , beeping ] You uncomfortable ? I 'm not uncomfortable . I 'm afraid . You don 't have to be afraid . You know me . I 'll be very gentle . I promise . Okay ? Her name was Rosemary . She was my daughter . I loved her . Precision of language . [ chuckles ] I could not be more precise . Do you know what that 's like ? To love someone ? I do . [ chuckles ] [ over speaker ] I 've cried , felt true sorrow . I 've sung , danced . I 've felt real joy . [ Chief Elder ] Then you should know better than anyone . You have seen children starve . [ grunts ] You 've seen people stand on each other 's necks just for the view . You know what it feels like when men blow each other up . Yes . Over a simple line in the sand . I do , I do , but ... And yet ... And yet , you and Jonas want to open that door again , bring all that back . If you could only see the possibility of love . - Why ? - Of love . - Love is just ... - With love comes faith , with it comes hope . Love is just passion that can turn . We can do better . It turns into contempt and murder . We could choose better . [ chuckles ] People are weak . People are selfish . When people have the freedom to choose , they choose wrong every single time . [ wind whistling ] [ Gabriel crying ] [ crying stops ] [ distant singing ] [ wind whistling ] [ distant laughter ] [ Gabriel grunts ] It 's a sled . [ Giver ] Loss and pain , music , Joy , the raw , impossible , beautiful feeling of love . Your son , he felt that . [ grunting ] That girl , she has felt it . That 's enough . We are living a life of shadows , of echoes , of faint , distant whispers of what once made us real . Excuse me for one second , Fiona . [ Chief Elder ] We must continue . [ rumbling ] [ rapid beeping ] [ hissing ] [ hissing ] [ hissing ] [ Jonas ] I wish I had been there when the memories returned . They were the truth . The Elders and their rules were the lie . So I do not apologize . I knew Fiona was safe , that I 'd see her again , and that I held the future there in my arms . [ distant singing ] [ Jonas ] The Giver had led us here to this house . It was real . From far behind me , from the place I had left , I thought I heard music , too . Perhaps it was only an echo , but it was enough . It would lead us all home .

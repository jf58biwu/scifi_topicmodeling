 Previously on Fringe : I want what you want . What do you think we should do about that ? The laws of physics are being disrupted here . Like the other universe , our world is starting to come apart at the seams . - Am I responsible for this ? - You don 't know that to be true . Unfortunately , I do . What happens to the body 's energy after death ? William theorized we should be able to capture that energy using what he called soul magnets . If he were right , he would contact me from the great beyond . The last will and testament of William Bell . " Nina , a memento of me . " I didn 't realize until later . I woke up , ahem , and there she was , in my bed . Yoko . What did he say ? It was the ' 70s . What could he say ? This is wonderful , Kevin you getting to sit here all night looking at these monitors . What a magnificent job . CEO of Massive Dynamic 's not a bad gig either . Must be nice , all that power . It was Belly 's intellect that made the company great . All I 've managed to do with its vast resources is to create a new flavor of cupcake frosting . Bacon-berry . Well , not for nothing but I 've worked for Mr. Bell for a long time and you 're the best boss I 've ever had . Look at them . Moving through the halls . There 's a rhythm to it . A cadence . Each monitor , its own movement . All blending together in a beautiful symphony . What 's in that room there ? No one ever goes in there . You know what that is , don 't you ? That 's William Bell 's office . Walter , what are you doing ? I 've spent the last two hours in Belly 's old office . I found the most amazing things . Animal ESP , a morality detector viral dreaming , powdered water , some of our ... Walter , why are you going through William 's old research files ? You know as well as I do that our universes are on a collision path . I have to protect our world . If Belly were here , he wouldn 't let everyone down . You 're not letting anyone down . William would have worked out what the machine does and how it relates to Peter . And to make matters worse , for the first time since we 've been reunited , Peter is truly happy . How so ? Peter and Olivia . I thought you knew . They 're a couple now . Well , that 's wonderful . Yes , it is . And his happiness is a constant reminder of the price of my failure of what will be lost if I don 't succeed . And I sat there , looking at these feeling depressed , missing my old friend wondering if I could succeed without him . Thinking how good we were together . But then I remembered how good we were together . And then I realized that maybe these contain the solution . Maybe if I went through these files , every detail , every thought pattern then maybe I could remember how to think the way I used to the way we used to . Back when there were no limitations . Back when anything was possible . Come on . Come on . Let 's go . Hey ! Koenig ! Come on ! Let me see your hands ! Oh , my God . Trial seven , March 15th . Initial testing on the memory discs I retrieved from the shapeshifters revealed no information . However , the daisy chain wiring pattern seems to have activated them somehow revealing tons of previously undetected data . Unfortunately , I have absolutely no idea how the hell to read it . Hey . Thought you were gonna sleep in . I thought you were gonna let me sleep in . I woke up early and it 's actually warm outside and there 's this great street fair . You like a street fair ? I love a good street fair . You 're not so bad yourself . So I figured , because you 're on the way ... Actually , I 'm not home right now . - Oh . - Yeah . I got up early and went to the gym . I wouldn 't wanna interrupt a workout . No , no . I 'm almost done . Uh , just let me shower up and I 'll meet you in 15 ? Perfect . I 'll swing by the house . Bye . Please say a command . Read text . I need you and the Bishops . It 's magical . They glanced up and saw Icarus float through the sky and taking him for a god , they stood still in wonder . Icarus had wings . We have no idea what 's keeping him up there . Was shot by a security guard early this morning . The guard said he found two of them coming down from the roof . There 's no alarm on the upper windows . Apparently , they used their ability to get up there . What a marvelous way to pilfer . So the other one got away ? Just ... Down , down , down . This man is dead . Assuming he is a man . I thought I saw him reach for a gun , so I shot him . And then he just floated away . Okay . So the other one , the one who got away , this is what he looked like ? Yeah . But his hair was longer . Any idea what they were after ? We 've been through the precious metals . The gold , platinum . Doesn 't look like anything was taken . They went to a lot of trouble , so they must have been after something . Agent Broyles . We found a key card on the dead man . This used in the building ? No . We 're still old-fashioned bolt and key . Contact the manufacturer . Let 's find out what door it unlocks . Agent Dunham . You got something ? We know what the thieves took . Well ... I think I know how they achieved counterbalance . The boots are weighted . Hold still , you infernal creature . So still thinking he 's not human , Walter ? Mustn 't rule anything out . Huh . That 's odd . Those calf muscles are extremely atrophied . You don 't utilize muscles when you float . Astronauts in space lose 5 percent of body mass a week . Deterioration like this , he would have had to be weightless for some time . The chest and shoulders are perfectly normal . Wouldn 't that affect the entire body ? Yes . Hey . Do you guys know anything about osmium ? Uh , it 's a metal , durable , used in electrical contacts and fountain pen nibs . Why ? The warehouse is missing a substantial quantity . I think that 's what our thieves were after . That 's weird , though , because osmium is extremely rare but isn 't all that valuable . No , but it 's ironic . Osmium is twice as dense as lead . It 's the heaviest element on Earth . It 's like using balloons to steal bowling balls . That would require that the cockpit be resistant to radiation at higher altitudes , no ? - Mm-hm . So why don 't we try to blend it with a slightly denser compound ? You have anything in mind ? Dr. Krick ? I 'm sorry , Scotty , give me a minute , will you ? - What are you doing here ? - Koenig is dead . There was a guard . He shot him . His body ? I left it . I had to . What do we do ? Go home . I 'll figure something out . There 's something else . I 've been nauseous . And my head is killing me . I didn 't feel like this the last time . Did you get what I asked for ? Not here . Not here . Go to the lab . Wait for me there . Is everything okay ? Yeah . Everything 's fine . What exactly am I looking for , Walter ? Anything related to gravity . I think I remember seeing a file on floaters in there . It could 've been from the period when Belly was in search of the perfect bowel movement . - Charming . Everybody poops , dear . - " Personal Flotation Devices " ? - Read that one to me . " The balloon is to be swallowed and inflated with helium via a tube inserted into the subject 's ... " - Yes . We never really did solve that design issue . I suspect that 's why we didn 't get many volunteers . And ... No helium in the blood works and no indication of anything gaseous , hydrogen , methane . Now , this is interesting . His white blood cell count is low . He 's got a weakened immune system . Perhaps what 's making him float is attacking his body 's defenses . Well , whatever it is I think the effects are wearing off . Hey . Any news on the second subject ? - So far , he 's not in the system . - So , what did you find ? The key card we found on the balloon man the manufacturer traced it to a warehouse in Allston . Perfect . Let 's take a ride . Mm . - What 's up ? - Nothing . When your mother and I were courting we used to take long walks in the park but I can see , for your generation , that a drive to a warehouse would be just as enchanting . - Right . Call us if you learn anything . - Ha , ha . What 's happening to me ? Oh , no . I don 't understand . You said if I got more of that stuff , it would be permanent . - Yes , I 'm working on that . - Then why am I getting sick ? You can 't defy gravity without consequences . That 's the problem . You 're a pioneer . Men like you , your participation in this experiment will help me discover a way to eliminate the side effects . I believe we may be just about there . Doesn 't make any sense . There 's nothing here that would alter body density . Two thirty-five . Astrid ! Walter , I 'm right here . Well , pick him up and put him on a table . The body has dropped three feet in the last half-hour . Like a dying balloon . Have you ever seen a balloon lose its buoyancy so inconsistently ? No . Something is eluding me . - Walter , I can 't . - I don 't expect you to solve it . - It 's a very difficult problem . - No , I mean ... I mean him . He 's too heavy . Dear God ! He weighs a ton . What ... ? What is it ? Take another sample of his blood . Run a test for osmium . What , you think that ... ? Why would that make him float ? It can 't , of course . That 's what 's troubling me . Your turn now . - Okay . I got one . - Okay . You know when we 're watching TV and you start to rub my back and you 're not paying attention because you 're distracted ? - Yeah . - And you uh , turn your hand in a circle just over and over and over ? I wouldn 't say that 's exactly how it is , but , yes , I know . It 's kind of like you 're burrowing through the muscle right into the bone . Okay . I think I get the point . Okay . I don 't like it . Really ? I had no idea . All right . No more burrowing . I love this full disclosure . Why didn 't we make this agreement earlier ? Well , it 's supposed to be about how we feel about each other , but ... No . It 's about everything . What , you holding out on me ? No , no , no . I 'm just clarifying . It 's about trust , so it 's a great game if two people are playing . Uh , Doyle Street . Just turn left here . Looks like we found the second thief . Yeah . And I think there 's a third . Unless he did that to himself . These bodies were dissected , but that 's not what killed them . It was the concentration of osmium in their blood . They all have toxic levels . What kind of exposure would lead to that ? Injection via syringe . Then why cut up the bodies ? Tissue samples , I suspect . Looks like an attempt at an autopsy . So how could injecting someone with the world 's heaviest element make them float ? It shouldn 't have . Runs contrary to the laws of nature . - So how is that possible ? - I don 't know . Do I look like I have answers ? I have a few . There are eight wheelchairs in total . One of the unis found them . We ID 'd a few of the bodies . Those men suffered from muscular dystrophy . - They 'd been handicapped for years . - Of course . A variation that primarily affects leg muscles . Simple . That 's why their chest and arms were healthy . The weightlessness didn 't cause the atrophy . The disease did . How could I have missed that ? So why target these people ? Does it have to do with the disease ? Well , they 'd be eager volunteers . They were confined to wheelchairs . How could they pass up an opportunity to fly ? It 's a deal with the devil nobody would pass up . - Go ! - Go ! Come on , buddy ! Whoa ! Stu ! - That 's right . - Michael ! Michael ! Heads up ! Nice ! Go , go , go . Yes ! - Time , ref . Time . - All right . Let 's go ! Bring it in , guys . Hey . Hey , listen . That was a hell of a play you made . I 'm impressed . These newbies don 't know how to play defense . - Is that right ? - Yeah . - No D ? - No D. Michael . - Yeah ? - Go get them . Other side ! - That 's it ! Take it ! - Go right ! Go right ! Hey ! Go ! Stay on him ! - Hit it ! - You gotta pass that ! Hey . Tough sport , huh ? Brutal . Must be quite a rush . Why aren 't you out there ? Never been healthy enough to play . But you wish you could , though , don 't you ? Ha , ha . I wish a lot of things . But I stopped believing in leprechauns and miracles a long time ago . Come on , man . Wake up . What if I told you I could give you a miracle ? Other side ! That 's it ! Take it ! What is it ? Osmium from the dead men 's blood in solid form . I had the morgue send me over the corpses ' blood so I could isolate it . Speaking of which , perhaps you could dispose of the excess . I went to Quantico for this ? - All the victims had different doctors . - And different insurance carriers . They must have something in common outside their disease . Something that makes them easy targets for whoever it is that 's doing this . - You wanna get a pizza ? - I don 't think Regina 's delivers this late . It doesn 't . I was thinking we could go get it . You look like you could use a break . - We 'll take the files in the car . - I gotta eat , right ? Excellent . Hey , guys . We 're going on a pizza run . You want anything ? Just some licorice . I 'll get you some from the machine , Walter . And no , thanks . I think I just lost my appetite . Fair enough . We 'll see you in a bit . The smiling is kind of freaking me out . Oh , don 't look now . Hello , Nina . What are you doing here ? Oh , I just came by to drop off a file that Peter requested from Massive Dynamic . But please , do not let go of a beautiful woman 's hand on my account . Walter told you , didn 't he ? Yes , and he 's very pleased . As am I. So , what 's the file about ? I 'm just doing some research on shapeshifters . Anything in particular ? No . Just background . It 's Broyles . I 'll be right back . Dunham . I must say , I think you have made a very wise decision to go forward . You deserve to be happy . Both of you . No , no , no , this is simply not possible . Well , I got more bad news . They 're out of licorice . - But I got you some mints . - Thank you . Whoever enabled these people to float is altering the basic properties of osmium . They 're making the heaviest element lighter than air . He 's defied physics . Our entire universe exists in a delicate state of equilibrium . And we know what happens if that balance is upset . Could cause a chain reaction . He 's messing with the fundamental constants of our world . It could lead to chaos . Aah ! Walter ! I don 't imagine you 're preparing for a science fair . - I 'll get a mop . - No . I 'll get a mop . Good to see you , Astrid . - Walter , what is it ? - I need Belly . I need his help . I can 't do this alone . This case , Peter ... I 'm failing , Nina . - Walter ... - I know he 's dead . I know that . But maybe we can bring him back . Look , one of his research projects . He posits here that a person 's soul or consciousness , continues to live on after death . And all it needs is a vessel or a host to return to . I remember . It was one of William 's more extreme flights of fancy . All he needed to do was to prepare someone by inserting uh , microscopic soul magnets inside them . And he proposes using injections , food , or cup of tea , or ... - Walter ... - What if he 's done it ? What if he 's done it ? What if he 's done it ? Then all we have to do is to figure out how to trigger the magnets to summon the soul back into the host and he 'll be back here with us . He cut out parts of my brain , Nina . I don 't think I 'm capable . Walter , it was never your intellect that made you exceptional . You 're brilliant , of course , but it was your imagination . Your boundless creativity . Yes , you 're not quite whole , Walter . But the best parts of you remain . So focus on that . - What if I fail ? - You won 't fail , Walter . How can you be so sure ? Because you can 't . All right , just like that . There . All done . - That 's it ? - Yeah . I don 't feel anything . Are you sure ... ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Good , you 're standing . Now walk . - Go on . You can do it . - I can walk . You can do much more than that , Vince . Oh , my God . This is amazing . Easy . Easy . Easy . - Okay . - Easy . You got plenty of time for that later . Okay . Okay . Okay . What are you , about a size 12 ? - Yeah . Why ? - Here . These 'll keep you grounded . It 's very important that you wear these when you 're outside . Without a tether , you 'll just keep floating up into the atmosphere . I don 't know how to thank you . You don 't have to . I just wish I had enough to make it permanent . Unfortunately , that was the last of my treatments . I don 't have the stuff I need to make another batch . How do we get more ? Nina was right , I just had to get creative . Walter , how is liquid nitrogen melting metal ? Whoever 's doing this has reversed the laws of physics . Up is down , left is right , and hot is cold . So cold temperatures will melt the element instead of heat ? Correct , my dear . What 's that white stuff ? It appears the osmium was mixed with another element . A mystery element . Call Peter and Olivia . Tell them to come right over . We have something to show them . - Ready , Michael ? - All right . Thank you . And one , two . You going somewhere , Dad ? Oh , I 've got some work to do back at the office . It 's nearly midnight . It 's just this new project . It is keeping me busy . - You push yourself too hard , Dad . - Yeah . I 'm close to something big , Michael . A breakthrough that 'll change everything . Change lives . But the answer is just out of my reach . You 'll get there , Dad . I know you will . You 've never failed before , and you won 't fail this time . - Good night , kiddo . - Good night , Dad . - Michael ? - Yeah ? See you in the morning . It 's lutetium . It was mixed with the osmium . Lutetium is dense , Walter . Extremely dense , just like osmium . Correct . The two shouldn 't even be able to form a molecule let alone one that would make a human being float . Walter , is this other element as rare as the osmium ? - Yes , very rare . - What are you thinking ? - lf it 's rare , he 's got a limited supply . - He 's gonna have to get more . Walter , whereabouts in Boston would he be able to acquire lutetium ? It 's mainly found in meteorites . Do you think the perpetrator 's from outer space ? Um , probably not . Where do you think we could find it on Earth ? He 'd need several samples . Where there 's an abundance of meteorites . The Museum of Science . The Museum of Science has an excellent astronomy wing . I 'm gonna call Broyles . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! B.P.D. is sending a unit to sit on the museum . Good . How 's security ? There 's a night watchman on duty . All the wings are individually locked from the inside . Seems pretty solid . Not solid enough . You sure you disabled the alarm ? I did exactly what you told me . What we practiced . Come on . We don 't have much time . If we were being robbed , I 'd know . We got cameras on all the doors . They didn 't come in through the doors . - You almost done ? - Almost . Somebody 's coming . Hurry up ! Get that door open now . Come on ! - Let 's go ! - You can 't just leave me ! I need your help ! Stop ! Turn around . Help me ! It 's slipping ! I can 't hold on ! Dad , nobody will tell me what is going on . I hurt some people , Michael . - What ? - I was trying to help them . I wanted to fix them . They were in wheelchairs like you . I know I should have told you sooner . Maybe if I had , it never would have come to this . I did it for you , Michael . When it was perfected , I was gonna give it to you . Is that how you see me ? - As something that you need to fix ? - No , no , no . Of course not . I just wanted you to be happy . I was happy . I went to bed at night knowing I had a father who loved me . Michael ? Michael ? Daedalus crafted wings for his son Icarus so he could fly away . So that he could be free . The wings he gave him wound up killing his son . I suppose that makes me a lucky man , then . Other parents weren 't so fortunate . I need to know how you did it . How did you defy the laws of physics ? I work in aeronautics . A few months ago , I was contracted to develop a new alloy for military aircraft . A metal dense enough to keep pilots safe from ground fire but still allow for flight . I wasn 't having much success . And then I combined two elements . - Rare elements . - Osmium and lutetium . And that 's when it happened . I 'd combined two of the densest elements on Earth and somehow the result was a new molecule a molecule lighter than air . - And that 's it ? - It should never have worked . It was an accident . A miracle . Walter . I know what made the men float . Yes , I heard that an arrest had been made . You found the man responsible , I take it ? There is a man in custody but Dr. Krick is not the man responsible . I am . Dr. Krick 's serum should never have worked . This man wasn 't changing the fundamental laws of nature . I think they were changing on their own . I think he took advantage of it . Don 't you see , Nina ? Our universe is starting to break down because of what I did 25 years ago . What we 've seen happening on the Other Side is starting to happen here . Well , you seem to be taking the news rather well . Because I finally figured out how to stop it . - Hey . - Hey . Thanks for meeting me . Is this why you , uh , asked me to meet you across campus and not at the lab ? So we could make out in front of college kids and not your dad ? No , not exactly . I haven 't been entirely honest with you . Whatever 's happening between the two universes , whatever our fate is I 'm right at the center of it . Peter , we 're all there for you . We 're all working together to figure this out . Look , I know that you 're all trying to help but it 's not your face in that drawing . It 's mine . So , what are you saying ? I 've been working on something for a while . Something I didn 't wanna tell anybody about because I can 't trust the FBI , and as much as I know Walter cares he 's too protective . I can 't trust his judgment . But I do trust yours . But I don 't want there to be any more secrets between the two of us . So full disclosure . Soul magnets . Walter , I thought we already talked about this . William is gone . You can 't bring him back . Maybe I can . Belly 's notes are incomplete , but I think I was right about the trigger . I think there is an instrument that can draw Belly 's consciousness out of its new vessel . - Walter , what are you doing ? - And I think Belly would have left it with someone he trusted . No , you can 't be serious . A person 's consciousness their soul , is energy and energy cannot be created or destroyed . No matter where Belly 's consciousness is the harmonic vibrations emanating from this bell will draw it forth from whatever vessel he chose before his death . Walter , you 're being ... Belly ? No , Walter . It 's still me . Of course . - Well , what now ? - lf I 'm right wherever Belly is he will find us . It 's everything we know about the machine . Every schematic , every piece of data , every diagnostic . - Are these ... ? - Memory discs from dead shapeshifters . Well , how did you get them ? They 're still working . The information on them is encrypted , though . I thought Astrid could figure it out , but I didn 't wanna bring her into this . I 've been running every code-breaking program but so far I can 't break it . That 's because the decoder key is in my office . What ? At the FBI ? No . At Massive Dynamic . Hello , Peter . It 's nice to see you again .

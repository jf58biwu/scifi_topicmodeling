 Previously on Eureka ... I ... I was naive to think I could just jump into this marriage . I 'm not your Henry . Not yet . Now , if I can 't be with you on Titan , I 'll be right here in mission control watching you every second . So go . On one condition . Marry me , Henry Deacon ? Absolutely . How 's it going ? Senator Wen just left . And she 's recommending a full pardon for me . From now on , if I stay in Eureka , it 'll be because I wanna be . Okay , listen , if we 're gonna be working together , and sleeping together , things are gonna get complicated , Jack . Oh , I can handle complicated . Follow my lead . Titan 's beautiful but dangerous . Core sample , marker five Delta . Five Delta . Copy that . Come here often ? Oh , ammonia plume ! Frak ! Sorry , Holly ! My suit ! It 's losing pressure ! No , no , no , we just have to re-calibrate the ... Oh , I 'm sorry , Holly ! I 'm so sorry , Holly . Sim session terminated . My snowflakes are still too small . Stand-by . Sim session 537 terminated . Goof around like that on Titan , and you 're dead . Easy , Huggins . We 've been at this all morning . I 'm just a little punchy . Yeah . And do you really need to vent the environment after every test run ? It has to be perfect . I agree . So let 's go again . Can 't . I 'm off to the B.C.E. To welcome home Tiny . Our little lady is due back from Titan . I wouldn 't use the words little or lady to describe Tiny . Are we not fond of the Titan rover ? We were almost vaporized by the Titan rover . Okay , that was a software glitch . Tiny 's my hero . She 's bringing back samples that 'll help me replicate the conditions on Titan precisely . Huggins ? You need to get out more . Yeah , and you need to stop flirting , okay ? All the other Astraeus candidates are focused on the mission . A dash of nitrogen and some phosphorus ... These lily hybrids are totally unique . Trust me , no one is gonna have centerpieces like yours . Wow . Whoa . I don 't usually offer my botanical research for personal use , but ... I 'm a sucker for weddings . Hey ! Best man , here , reporting for duty . Oh , well , best man , I suggest you prepare a toast this time . Last time , you rambled . I did ? Like it was open mic night . Oh , and don 't , lose the rings again . I lost the rings ? So I hear . Which reminds me , we need to choose new ones . But ... Um , what 's ... I mean , what 's wrong with these ? Nothing . But this time 's different , so new beginning , new rings . Really ? Mmm-hmm . Really ? Mmm-hmm . So how you been , Sheriff ? Oh , can 't complain , can 't complain . Nice ... Nice blooms you got . Thank you . Jack . Yep ? Hey . Okay , I don 't want you to get all worked up ... Oh , this doesn 't sound good . Just consider it a temporary nuisance . Now that we 're involved , I had to file an I.A. 248 with the D.O.D. An I. A ? It 's the form required for our " intimate alliance . " There can 't be a form for that ! Normally , it 's a formality , but ... Given what happened to me recently on your watch , well , our relationship has been red-flagged . Our relationship 's been red-flagged ? Because of our high rank , the D.O.D. Is concerned . They have sent a relationship auditor to assess us . Assess us for what ? National security . Hello , Sheriff . Warren Hughes . Warren ... " Ph. D. , M.A. , C.P.A. " I cover all the bases . Mmm . So , as I 've told Dr. Blake , I 'm here pursuant to an I.A. 248 filing . Well , Warren , how do you " assess " an intimate alliance ? I like to watch . You ... You ... Oh , I don 't mean " watch " watch . No , you two just carry on , go about your business , and , pretend I 'm not even here . Who is he to judge us ? What , is he some sort of mid-level paper pusher from D.O. D ? Actually , our office intends to go entirely paperless by 2016 . Yeah ? I 'm vice chair of the Green Team . All we have to do is keep it professional . Oh , so no groping ? Is that ... Let 's just get through the day . Fortunately , it looks like it 's gonna be a quiet one . So , Dr. Blake , exactly what 's happening here ? Well , Tiny , our robot rover , has just finished building a site just like this on Titan to facilitate our faster than light travel . And she 's bringing back soil and air samples so I can recreate the perfect ethane fog , hydrocarbon lakes , methane burps . Sounds delightful . Yeah . The next best thing to being on Titan . Our Astraeus team will be prepared for anything , which includes traveling via FTL , just like Tiny . You don 't wanna miss it . Trust me , I never miss a thing . Oh . Great . Henry , uh , Dr. Deacon , commence return course sequence . Activating . Let 's bring her home . Easy ! Ah , she 's just getting her bearings . It 's been a rigorous assignment . She 's sweet ! Hey , welcome home , girl ! I got dibs on her samples . Hang on ! I 've gotta deactivate her de-pressurization shield . Shield 's clearing in three , two , one . He needs a C.T. For blunt force trauma , possible concussion . Mr. Hughes . Are you okay ? Well , my ears are ringing . Yeah , exploding robots will do that . It 's tinnitus . It 's a result of the blast . It 's usually temporary . It 's usually ? I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . We will take care of you . I 'll live . Now I can watch you and Sheriff Carter handle a crisis . One second she was here , and the next ... What happened ? Well , I won 't know until I examine her remains . Oh , I 'm sorry ... ALLISON : Any theories , Dr. Deacon ? Well , Dr. Blake , um ... There is a strong methane presence on Titan , as a gas , as a liquid , and as a solid . Now , Tiny was in prolonged contact . So she may have somehow absorbed a dangerously high concentration . If that 's the case , once I deactivated her de-pressurization shield , the tiniest of sparks could 've caused her to explode . This is a disaster . I was counting on those samples . Well , hopefully her containment unit is still intact . Sheriff Carter . Sheriff ? I need you to check the area . Oh , come on . This thing 's probably blown halfway to ... Um ... yeah . I will do that , Dr. Blake . Well , I 'll come with you . We can chat . Fantastic . But ... Please . It 's okay . You can look . What ? No , no , I wasn 't trying to ... Doug , we might spend six months in close quarters together . You 're bound to see me in my skivvies . Okay . For the mission . Which brings up something else . Um , ex ... excuse me ? We failed at our last simulation . Uh , yeah , my bad . I was just distracted , you know , because you 're so ... Distracting . Hence our problem . And I think I have a solution . Just the two of us , we need to spend some time together , just getting to know each other , talking ... Talking . Okay , that 's one approach . What ... What did you have in mind ? I was thinking that , um , we ... We should just have sex . Our budding urges are interfering with our professional ambitions . Wait . " Our " urges ? You mean , like , mutual ? Definitely , so that 's why I think the most sensible course of action is to satisfy them . What , now ? Yeah . The sooner we consummate , the sooner we concentrate . Uh-oh . We have a Tiny problem . Oh . Oh , no ! Tiny , the robot . She exploded . Yeah , I have to go look into it . All right , well , rain check ? Tonight ? Absolutely . All right . Okay . Sign here and , uh , here . Initial here and ... We 're done . So that 's it . It 's official ? Full and complete pardon . Well , thank you very much , Jo . Forget it . You know , it must be a sad day for you , though . I mean , I know how much you love locking me up . Oh , I still can if you misbehave . Only if it 's on your turf . I can go anywhere now . I 'm a free man . So does that mean you 're leaving ? Maybe . Who knows ? And if I do , this could be the last time we ever see each other . So what are your intentions ? Well , my intentions are to find these scientifically fascinating samples . No , I meant with Dr. Blake . My intention is to continue to enjoy our relationship . Which you would consider to be " A , a fling , " B , friends with benefits , " C , leading to a serious commitment , " or " D , other " ? E. None of your business . Well , now , Sheriff , you 're obliged to respond , as per section QV6 ... Holy smoke . What is that ? I guess some pieces of Tiny started a fire . Wait here . Oh , penny candy . You 're not gonna get rid of me that easily . Poor Tiny . The CH4 concentration is more than 3,000 P.P.M. It 's like she was saturated with methane . Which means we definitely have to rethink the filtration for the Astraeus habitat . Tiny , you didn 't blow up for nothing . Henry , I have to ask , are you okay with getting married ? I ... I couldn 't be happier . It 's just ... Are ... Are you okay ? I asked you to marry me , remember ? So , adios , Tiny . And where have you been ? Oh , I was tangled up with Zane . With his thing . His pardon thing . Uh , so , you guys must be swamped with wedding plans . Need any help ? Oh , no , no , it 's just an intimate party with friends . No fuss . Yeah , but you guys are making a commitment to each other . You gotta go all out , you know , big and splashy . Oh , we 're gonna go all out . Small and simple . Huh . The smoke seems to be gone , Sheriff . Keen eye , Warren . Oh , is that the containment unit ? Yeah , it looks like . I mean , it might 've sprung a leak ... Ooh ! My eyes are starting to sting . I don 't think we should be here . I could give you a lift home . You wanna give a mid-level paper pusher a ride home ? I knew that was gonna haunt me . Oh . Sheriff , is that a part of your robot ? Wait , what is that ? A foot ? Yeah , just don 't touch anything , okay ? Mmm . Get me out ! Warren ! Ah ! I 've gotcha . Don 't let go ! You picked a bad day for an audit . The earth just opened up and swallowed me . It was horrible . I 'm just glad that you 're okay . Oh , I 'm ... I 'm fine , too , over here . Just if you were ... Can I speak to you for a moment ? Sure . You almost broke the auditor . The sinkhole wasn 't my fault . Can you please be more cautious ? This assessment is serious . This assessment is ridiculous . You run G.D. I protect the town . After hours , when I get lucky , we sleep together . Shh ! Jack , shh ! Look , look ... What are you writing ? Just a few notes . Please , carry on . Just ... Just ... Jack , um ... I 'll give you notes . Why don 't you go check in with Henry and see what progress he 's made ? I 'm ... Check in with Henry and see what progress he 's made . Testy , isn 't he ? Actually , he is the most level-headed , even-tempered person in a town full of huge egos . Oh , do you have a huge ego ? Yes . Do you really see a future together ? I don 't know . Why , what did Jack say ? I won 't say anything . Dr. Blake , I mean , you have to admit , the two of you do make a strange combination . Here you are , in charge of some of the most brilliant scientists in the world . I mean , you 're a genius ! And Sheriff Carter is , well , you know ... Jack Carter may not have a bunch of degrees , but in many ways , he is the smartest man that I know . Hyper-defensive . That 's interesting . Excuse me . I believe , the orange fog you saw was primarily composed of ethane . But I thought methane 's what made Tiny explode . It did . Both compounds are prevalent on Titan . Oh , so the samples are leaking . Possibly , but the protective seal appears not to be broken . Sorry to interrupt , but Grace , I 've been doing a bit of reading , and it seems that people tie their weddings together with a theme , like vintage glamour or country charm . Jo ? Yeah . I appreciate your enthusiasm ... What were you thinking for a gown ? Oh , no , no , I wasn 't gonna wear anything formal . Yeah , but I think that you would look so beautiful in something like this . I think that 's just a bit much . Martha Stewart , can I borrow you for a second ? Yeah . I think you 're going a little bit overboard . Carter . Yeah . Henry got dumped into this timeline married to a woman he didn 't know . But they still managed to fall in love . Okay , now , that is a new timeline success story . It deserves to be celebrated . So , Dr. Leonardo is expecting us at her lab to choose flowers . Oh , no , we already picked out our flowers . Yeah , but we can reconsider . I think it 's cute . Hacking the mainframe ? Not exactly how I 'd celebrate a pardon from the Pentagon . I 'm not hacking , I 'm upgrading . But upgrades aren 't due till next month . Well , I wanted to check off another item on my to-do list before I leave . Since when do you have a to-do list ? And since when are you leaving ? Well , I 'm a free man . There 's nothing holding me here now . What about Jo ? Well , it 's not like we 're really together . And she 's not asking me to stay . Okay , but I am . I need your advice . About ? Women . Specifically , Holly Marten . Well , the doctor is in . She wants to upgrade our relationship . And by upgrade , I mean ... Yeah , I get it . But ... Just seems like it 's going too fast for me . I mean , where 's the whole getting to know you , courtship part ? What the hell is wrong with you ? Have you seen her ? But isn 't having sex too soon kinda like skipping over the meat and potatoes and going straight to dessert ? There 's no such thing as having sex too soon . Dessert is the best main course , and if you 're lucky , you 're gonna get seconds and thirds , am I right ? Huh ? Methane concentration is unusually high , and I 'm getting readings for ... Yeah , ammonia . I can smell it . Yeah , enough to destabilize the ground in this area . What , are you talking more sinkholes ? Well , if the levels continue to rise , you can say good-bye to the B.C.E. For starters . Henry , is there ammonia on Titan ? In spades . Well , if we have little pieces of Tiny scattered all over Eureka ... You know what , I should expand the search boundaries . Right . So , you nervous ? Well , the idea of being sucked into a giant sinkhole is not exactly pleasant . I know , marriage is a big commitment . No , you know what ? I 'll tell you what . I wasn 't nervous . What 's changed ? Well ... I gave other Henry 's ring to Grace , telling her that I would earn it . And I thought I had . Now ? Well , now she wants a new one . So I feel like I still have to live up to him . Me . High levels of ammonia and methane in the 24th quadrant . Uh , and if those two mix , the fog could be extremely toxic . All right , what 's in the 24th quadrant ? Uh , off-site lab , agricultural ... Dr. Leonardo . All right . Yeah , no baby 's breathe in her bouquet . Everyone uses that . She needs something special . Well , how about lavender ? Smell . Mmm , I love it . I hate it . So how about something more exotic like jasmine or bird of paradise ? Those plants aren 't exactly in season . The seasons don 't matter in here . Flip a switch , make it summer . What about , um , Henry 's boutonniere ? Roses are generic . What on Earth ? Is that normal ? No . And neither is that . This way . Everybody out ! We 've gotta shut off the vents . The main control valve is over here . Okay , go . Jo , we need to get outta here ! I 'm right behind you . Jo ! Grace ! What is this stuff ? I don 't know . Grace ! Jo ! You in here ? Carter ! Over here ! You okay ? You okay ? Yeah . The ethane fog . It 's coming through the vents . Carter ! Shut the valve ! Careful . The Tradescantia as a breed is delicate . Are you kidding me ? This thing is trying to feel me up . How 'd the fog get into these vents ? Well , whatever contaminated Eureka has found its way through the soil and then somehow infiltrated the venting system . Is it always like this in here ? No , but I think the plants saved our lives . They must 've absorbed the fog . If there was a nitrate radical present , it could 've stimulated a rapid , massive overgrowth . So ... We 're now swamped by methane , ethane , ammonia ... And nitrogen , all found in heavy concentrations ... On Titan . On Titan . Right . Holly ! How you doing ? Well ... I am really looking forward to tonight . Yeah , me too . Um , but you know , if it feels like we 're rushing things , we could , maybe just have dinner . Dinner ? Yeah , you know , hang out , shoot the breeze , share secrets . Oh , no , let 's just stick with the plan and have sex . Sounds awesome . Great , okay . Well , until tonight ... Ooh . What 's wrong ? I 'm sorry . I can 't do that . Not like this . Not with you . Vince , come on , we haven 't even ordered yet . Test batch . I want angel food cake . Jo insists on hazelnut . Bold choice for a wedding cake if you ask me . I think you should decide . But I 'm right . You 're not concerned about the cake , are you ? No . Okay . All right , talk to me . What 's wrong ? You want new rings . So ... What are you gonna do with the old ones ? I mean , you wanna keep wearing them around your neck ? I mean , it 's like you 're embracing me with one arm , but holding onto somebody else with the other . So all three women are fine and very lucky . Good . Prolonged exposure to the fog is lethal . And Jo 's still in the infirmary ? She 's in her office . Wow . With Warren . She 's the head of security . Aw ! He wants her perspective on our relationship . Yeah , but Jo 's giving insight about our relationship ? I mean , she dated a robot . Well , we cannot interfere . How 'd your little talk with him go ? It 's funny , I didn 't realize how difficult it was to define what we are to each other . It wasn 't , till he got here . I think it 's just hard , you know , with Henry and Grace making a real commitment . So you think a commitment , for ... Okay , don 't panic . No , I ... I didn 't say anything about marriage . But now that you brought it up , is it so inconceivable ? Why , is it for you ? I asked you first . Hey , Jack , I 'm glad I found you . Look , I 'm sorry , I gotta show you something . Okay , great , we 'll talk about this later . Apparently . Sheriff Carter and Dr. Blake have never engaged in unprofessional behavior in the workplace ? No . No , they 're ... They 're always discreet . Even when Allison spends the night at our house ... Well , uh , my house is under construction . And Carter was kind enough to let me stay . He ... He 's a very good friend . Sheriff Carter is dating the head of G.D. While living with the head of G.D. Security . But it 's not as Three 's Company as it sounds . No , that is very enlightening . But , I just ... No , really . Thank you . Okay . New uniform ? Oh ! No , I was ... I 'm just helping Grace plan her wedding , yeah . Mmm . She doesn 't seem to be here . Yeah , but , uh , you 're still here . Well , I heard you had a close call at the aggie lab . So do you need anything ? Like a rake ? Or some weed killer ? No , I 'm good . Good . Yeah . Yeah , well ... I guess this is good-bye , then . Yeah , I ... Again . I guess so . Mmm-hmm . Mmm-hmm . Mmm-hmm . Tiny didn 't absorb anything . The final tests show that Tiny 's remains were only coated with methane . Meaning ? That the exposure was terrestrial , after her return from Titan . Well , if she overdosed at the B.C.E. , then where 'd all the methane come from ? Well , that 's what I don 't know . Yeah . What 's wrong with you ? Oh , nothing . Unless you call losing the girl of your dreams before you ever even had her wrong . Ah , very sorry about that . Uh , bigger problems at the moment . So there were a mixture of compounds that created the ethane fog . Oh , the guy at the B.C.E. , uh , who was whining about losing Tiny ... He said that he was planning on creating that in his lab . Huggins , Titan atmosphere specialist . So type A. Any tiny mistake , and he 'd flush his entire simulation down the proverbial toilet . And those simulations utilized actual methane , ammonia ... Whoa ... When he dumped it , where would it go ? To an underground evacuation chamber . So it 's possible that the waste from those simulations could 've permeated the chamber and leached into the soil . Okay , let 's go with that . How 'd it pop up across town ? There are geothermal vents that run through all the layers of the soil at both sites leading from G.D. To the B.C.E. Site and passing directly through Main Street . And it 's all interconnected . I 'll find Huggins . And I 'll get Grace , and we 'll identify the hot spots . I 'll just sit here . Alone . Not having sex . Stop ! Don 't touch it . Don 't touch anything . I have to , Sheriff . My methane flurries are too small . Our Astraeus candidates need to be prepared for the real thing . Wait , stop ! How many times have you flushed Titan down the toilet ? Uh , 596 . Why ? Listen , you 've overloaded the evacuation chamber . It 's found its way through the vents and into the soil . Now we got sinkholes and ethane fog popping up all over town . I made ethane fog ? Uh , was it thick ? 'Cause , you know , I never really got the mix ... Not the point ! Your simulation is turning Eureka into Titan . Oh , we can 't let that happen . We 'll all die . All right . Everybody inside . Come on , inside ! All right , everyone inside . Come on , inside ! Inside . Let 's go . Inside . Inside . Henry . Hey , hey ! Inside , inside . Come on . Leaving so soon ? Well , apparently , you 're in no rush to go anywhere . Turns out I like saying good-bye to you . Wanna say it again ? Zane , what are you waiting for , a farewell party ? Actually , I prefer private parties . Uh-huh . Seriously . I like this . Quiet and simple . It 's just me and you . Code Four emergency response activated . Party 's over . Code Four emergency response activated . Is that ... Methane snow . Extremely ... Explosive . Yeah . Titan has come to Main Street , and it 'll spread if we can 't vent it . Here , guys . Use this on the door . Great . Main street 's been evacuated , but there 's still people trapped at Café Diem . That ethane fog is a killer . Yeah , you said that . Now , again , is there any way to get this off Main Street ? No . I ... Well , I have been developing a ... A portable evacuation unit , but , it , no ... It hasn 't been tested yet . Dr. Huggins , maybe the time is now . Say no more . I 've trained for a moment like this . But I 'll need my partner . Once Fargo and Holly pump the fog off of Main Street , it 's gonna spread underground . The whole town could destabilize . All right , well , the vents on Main Street , can we redirect them someplace else ? Yes , but to where ? I 'm thinking Dr. Leonardo 's lab . I mean , her plants absorbed the fog and cleaned the air , right ? Sort of like photosynthesis ! I loved science class . All right , everybody move back . Look ! Who is that ? Hey . Hey . It 's Fargo . You okay ? Yeah . We can do this . Thanks for working with me , Holly . It 's my job . From now on , you and I are strictly business . All right , careful . Easy . Holly , the methane snow ! Remember , it 's explosive . Step lightly . Don 't worry about me . What are they doing ? They 're gonna redirect the fog . Jack , it 's still confined to Main Street , but it 's spreading quickly . Now , if the evac unit works , you just have to open the valve in time . Or Eureka will become one giant pit . Got it . Easy , Ms. Lupo . Stay in your lane . I am in my lane . No backseat driving . Prying open . I can 't get mine open . What are you doing ? Something 's wrong . I gotta get out there . No , Henry , Henry , give them a chance . Holly ! You okay ? I think so . Oh , no ! What 's wrong ? The sparks . Something happened . My suit , it 's losing pressure ! Your tank must 've been damaged . I 'm gonna die on Titan without leaving Main Street . She needs to go slower . That 's the opposite of going slower ! Just close your eyes , Warren , and breathe . Just breathe . Stay calm . Save your air , Holly . I can 't recalibrate . These gloves , my fingers keep slipping . We 're going to switch you to the reserve tank . Done and done . Thanks . You 're welcome . We 're at the lab now . Don 't you need space suits ? The fog is toxic ! We don 't have time ! We got a plan ! Warren , stay . What ? Okay . I got it in . Now , let 's finish this off . Ah ! Watch it . Okay . Okay . Okay . Son of a ... Why won 't it open ? It 's under too much pressure . Let me help ! I can bench press twice my weight . Okay . Way to go , Warren . All right , get out of here . This stuff 's poison . What about you ? Well , I 'll be right behind you . Jo ? Yeah , okay , come on . All right . You can 't stay in here . I 'm not leaving . You 're stubborn . And you 're wasting time . Yeah , I got it . Let 's go ! Okay . Yes ! We did it . Oh ! Up top . You okay ? I think so . Oh , we did it . Write that down . Whoa . Saved the day , huh ? Look , I 've been thinking . I ... I was wrong . Wrong ? About what ? My advice . Wasn 't the right approach , at least not for you . Uh , hey , Holly . Hi . Uh ... Look , he 's a ... He 's a really good guy . Anyway , um ... There 's plenty of time for dessert . Maybe , if you wait , it 'll taste even better . Thanks . You can go now . Okay , thanks for saving us . So , dessert , huh ? Look , Holly ... Before , it wasn 't that I wasn 't interested ... It 's that I was too interested . I really like you . And I don 't wanna miss all the parts in between . Yeah , but I am terrible at that stuff . And I am really , really good at dessert . And you have no idea how much I am looking forward to that . But I ... I just ... I really wanna get to know you first . But that 's where things start going wrong . I mean , what if you don 't laugh at my jokes ? Or you like the original Star Trek ? And I like Next Gen. But the not knowing , that 's the exciting part . You 're just taking a chance . And by the way , I like both Star Treks . Really ? Me too . Yeah ? See , that wasn 't so hard , was it ? Mmm , fog-free , just the way I like it . So a little taste of Titan didn 't give you second thoughts ? About joining Astraeus ? No , I still want to go . Good . Good , all right . But the thought of being two billion miles away from you ... Oh , I don 't know ... Grace , Grace , Grace ... I will be with you always . Would you be comfortable wearing this ? Would you be comfortable ? I mean , it was his ... Well , mine , but ... The truth is , you are my Henry . Hey . We run a respectable town . Hey , hey , hey . Mayor . Um , Jo ... We are so grateful , but what you want for our wedding , it 's just not us . Not us . No . I know . Good . Now , get in . Oh . Um , what is going on ? Well , isn 't this where you first met ? Well , that 's , how I remember it . Yeah , me too . Then I picked the right spot . Surprise ! I hope it 's okay . Jo , it 's perfect . Thank you . Oh , my ... Jo , it 's perfect . Are you so excited and surprised ? Completely . Well , now you gotta go through with it . Tell you what , we could do a double wedding . Oh . You gotta hand it to them . How they made it all work out . Yeah , I guess that proves it 's possible . Am I late ? No , you are right on time . Warren is here to officiate . He has a license to marry . Of course he does . So who 's the happy couple ? We are . Oh , wonderful . So , choose a spot . Okay . Yeah , looks like this is good . So ... Sheriff Carter , Dr. Blake , it 's been quite a day . Well , sort of standard stuff for Eureka , but , we make a pretty good team , yeah ? Well , I 've already filed my report with the D.O.D. So what did it say ? Or is it confidential ? You may as well know now , I think the two of you are very impressive , and it 's quite clear how much you care about each other . In other words , too much . Your personal feelings are bound to get in the way . And so , uh , your relationship has not been approved . But ... Are you kidding ? Jack , could you ... Oh , come on ! That means you have to terminate your intimate alliance effective immediately or resign your posts . Excuse me . We 're gonna fix this . Oh , I love weddings . Shall we begin ? It 's so beautiful . My friends ... Or should I say , acquaintances ... We gather tonight to celebrate , Henry . Henry . And ... Grace . Grace ! A couple whose love transcends time . They 're here to renew their vows with respect for the past , joy in the present , and commitment to the future . Together forever .

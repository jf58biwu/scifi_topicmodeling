[ Work horn ] They got some environmentalist showing up from Washington , And I sure as hell don 't want her to see The way of setting explosives below the aquifer . You set ? Let her rip , Tyee ! Fire in the hole ! [ Beeping ] [ Explosion ] Alright , let 's go ! Alright , everybody , listen up ! The truckers are going to make one more run ! But there 's a bonus for everyone if we get this process Before our friend from Washington arrives . [ Laughter ] You are talking my language , boss . Whoa ! Tanner ? What the hell just happened ? Must have fallen . Tanner , where 's Tanner ? Get rescue down here now ! Now , damn it ! Come on Kruger , it 's breakup . You know I can 't send a truck up that road . It 's 34 degrees ! Ice melts at 32 ! Thanks for the lift . So 44 huh ? Just had to get one more run in , didn 't ya ? A guys gotta make a living . Yeah , yeah , save it . [ Laughing ] 44 flip-flops each . Makes it a tie for top dog , Jack ! There 's never been a tie before . First time for everything . Uh-huh . Come on , let 's get paid . You 're killing me , you know that , don 't you ? Fine , fine , I 'll see what I can do . Just hang tight . Damn it ! Your name is on this thing five times , Jack . This was supposed to be my year . You know , the Japanese say a tie is better than a win . I 'm not Japanese and this sure ain 't no geisha house . Alright , before you rush off to cash these At the first bank you see in Fairbanks , I need one more delivery . ( All ) : Aww ! Come on , Sparkman , hand them over . I got a hot date tonight with this Swedish little seat-cover You ever saw . She calls me every day . Yeah , it 's his mom . He 's late on the rent . [ Laughter ] Listen , Kruger is desperate for enough explosives To hold him over ' till the first boat gets through . Explosives ? I wouldn 't hold manure through that slush . You can count me out . Count me out . Come on . Triple rate . Come on , triple ? Take it or leave it , Sparky . Triple rate . Jack , I need two rigs . One more flip-flop makes me top dog , Jack . Triple rate , huh ? Just kill ya if I won this , wouldn 't it ? What do you say , Jack ? I say I 'm a poor trucker with alimony payments . You got yourself another rig . Now you 're talking . One more convoy of 20 tons of kaboom , my friend . Don 't get nervous on me now ... Huh ? [ Laughs ] I am going in . Need light and steady . Hang in there Tanner ! Coming down ! [ Growls ] Holy Mother ! Run ! Everybody run ! Run ! Go go ! [ Growls ] Go , go ! Bombshell ! Radio for help ! I 'll get the explosives ! Can you move ? ! Yeah ! [ Growls ] [ Screaming ] Okay , but no promises . I appreciate your assistance . Everybody appreciates . You should appreciate crapping on my already crappy day . Welcome to my world . [ Screaming ] [ Distant screams ] [ Growls ] Mr. Kruger , thank god ! Get outta my way ! [ Roar ] Ugh ! Please ... I don 't want to die . You 're already dead . Ahhhh ! What the hell is that thing ? ! Wentshu ! Wentshu ! I got keys , I got keys ! [ Gagging sounds ] Anybody call for help ! No ! Go , go , go ! Go , go , go ! Come on , let me in ! It 's Kruger ! Let me in ! You two make a break for it . I 'll keep it busy . You mean we let it eat you while we run away ? ! You don 't get it , we don 't have a choice . We need to get help now ! Go ! Hey ! Haven 't you loaded up yet ? I hate hauling this stuff . When it 's on the trailer , it 's all dead weight to me . Oh , god , that reminds me . I knew this guy in Oregon once , Who was hauling this load of explosives to this strip mine , If this story ends with a bang , spare me , will ya ? Oh , Jack , all my stories end with a bang . That 's what makes them so interesting . Jack , got a hitchhiker for you . A what ? Rachel Harris . Well , hello , Rachel . I 'm Neil Conroy , it 's a pleasure to meet you . What 's this about ? Some congressional committee is demanding An environmental assessment of Arctic breeze . So you 're what ... a scientist ? Research analyst actually . Oooh . Now , that 's what I call tax dollars at work . She gets a ride up there today Or they 're shutting the mine down . Oh , you 're gonna love the Arctic breeze doc . It 's got the charm of a Siberian Gulag . Why can 't she take the chopper ? Chopper is down , Jack . Well , in that case you never mind them , doc . I 'll be your chauffeur today . Here , let me take your bag for you . You 're riding with him , lady ? A trailer full of explosives are the least of your worries . You just shut your pie hole . Honestly , ma 'am , I 'm a southern gentleman . Fine , she 's all yours then . You all set doc ? Let me give you the tour . Now , if you come with me , Let me introduce you to my rig . We got hot water , tunes . Bye , bye Jack . Have a good trip . Well , welcome aboard doc . This is my home away from home here . Nice . Oh , yeah . She 's a nice ' 96 Peterbilt With a big can 4-350 , got 3-90 's and one sweet air ride . I have no idea what you just said , But I 'll take your word for it . [ Laughs ] She 's also got 18 speed floor transmission . You know what that means ? No . It means she may take a little while , But once she gets warmed up Oh , boy , she 'll give you one smooth ride If you know what I mean . Listen ... You 're a smart gal , aren 't you ? Yeah . Me too . I lied , I 'm a Pisces . Me too . [ Laughs ] I 'll tell you what , doc , tours not over . I 've got a whole big bedroom back here . Comfy mattress , tons of videos , Actually on second thought you might not be into those videos . I got satellite TV though , HBO . Appealing . Want to give a lady a lift ? You know , you don 't need to worry about Neil . He 's all talk , absolutely harmless . I rode up here on a gravel hauler with a teamster That would not shut up . I haven 't really slept in 24 hours . So I could really use some ... Quiet . You mind ? No , come on up . [ Country music ] * * * Jack , you old dog ! You 're one lucky suicide jockey , you know that ? 10-4 . Suicide jockey , huh ? That 's a trucker 's talk for a driver hauling explosives . Nice . Hey doc , Next 300 miles there 's nothing between us And the cold blue sea except a couple of feet of ice . [ Laughs ] Don 't worry , it 's not that soft . Don 't listen to him , doc , he 's plenty soft . You think someone got a call out for help ? Wentshu took down the satellite uplink . That 's the second time I heard you call it that . Wentshukumishiteu . What are you talking about ? It 's an Inuit legend . Lives under the ice and feeds on human flesh . Wentshu . No freaking legend is taking me alive . If it comes to it or us , okay ? [ Growls ] [ Loud banging ] [ Loud banging ] [ Loud banging ] [ Loud roar ] [ Screaming ] Is this your daughter ? Yeah . Are you married ? Divorced ? Messy , huh ? I thought you wanted to sleep . I was just trying to make conversation . * What was that ? Hold on . Are we turning around ? No , not when they 're paying triple we 're not . What do you say , top dog ? Follow me and stay close . You 're the expert . 10-4 . Open your door . What ? Open your door . If I tell you to jump you do and ask no questions . Okay . Hold on . Come on now . I got your back . Come on ! Come on ! Come on now . Come on . Come on , baby . There you go . That 's it . We 're good ? Yeah , we 're good . Welcome to life on the ice road . If I lost my rig , You 'd be hearing from my insurance company . Yeah , you wish , cowboy . There really is nothing out there , is there ? Well , not completely . Do you want a coffee ? Don 't tell me there 's a Starbucks . Better . Lowman 's . What 's that ? Truck stop . Lowman and his wife , Beryl . The best Java for 300 miles . Is that because it 's the only Java for 300 miles . [ Laughs ] You 'll have to try it someday . No thanks . I don 't plan on spending too much time on the ice road . Yeah , I said that once too . Hey Jack , gate is up . That 's weird . There is always somebody here . [ Laughs ] Something 's not right . They don 't get their explosives , They just take the day off ? No ... this is something else . Kruger ! Anybody here ! Oh , my god ! Oh , my god , Jack ! What the hell happened here ? Oh , no . Oh , my god ! Explosion ? If this is an accident , where is the first response team ? Where is everybody ? I have to go find Kruger . Kruger ! Jack ! Oh , my god ! What happened here ? It 's Reid . I think I 'm going to be sick . Jack , let 's just get outta here , man . Okay ? Is anybody here ! No seriously Jack , let 's just get the hell out of here , okay ? Is anybody here ! Hello ? ! [ Distant ] Over here ! Wait . Did you hear that ? Over here ! It 's coming from over there . Jack ! Hello , over here ! Tyee ! Jack ... Did you see it ? The Wentshu ? The what ? Everyone always said it was just a myth , But I saw it . It 's true . Tyee , where 's everyone ? Dead . Okay , let 's get you back to the truck . You okay ? Can you walk ? Let 's get outta here before whatever that thing is returns . You 're gonna be fine , alright ? We 'll get you in the truck and warmed up , alright ? [ Growls ] Whoa , whoa , whoa ! [ Loud growls ] What the hell is that ? Wentshu . Come on , come on , come on , let 's go . Run , run , run ! We 're not going to make it Jack ! [ Loud roar ] [ Whisper ] That 's it , go that way . [ Roar ] You go up and have a look and make sure it doesn 't come back . Okay . Tyee , what the hell is that thing ? I told you ... it 's Wentshu . I thought it was just a story to scare the kids , But it 's true . What 's the story ? It moves under rock , ice , and on land and it eats ... What ? Us . I saw it take Tanner Krem , Reid . Kruger too . [ Roars ] [ Whispers ] It 's crisscrossing back and forth out there . It can 't see us ... Where did this thing come from ? We set our charges deeper into the permafrost Than ever before . The charge unearthed a ton of high-grade diamonds . It grabbed Tanner , crawled out of the pit And went wild . [ Loud roars ] Okay , okay . So what do we do ? How did you survive ? I hid under this blanket . The thermal blanket . Kept me warm . Well most of me . [ Roars ] Jack we can 't stay here , okay ? This thing is going to find us . [ Truck engine starting ] Oh , my god , that 's my rig . Someone just started up my rig ! At least we know we 're not alone . Alright , we 're going to have to make a run for it . [ Loud growls ] You ready ? Okay , now ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Go , go , go ! Nice of you to join the party , Kruger ! Move over ! Go ... Go ... Go . Good idea . Alright . Come on , baby . Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! What the hell are you doing ? Son of a bitch , follow me ! That 's it ! Follow me , leave them alone . The road 's that way . Not leaving them behind . This might be our only chance ! Give me the wheel ! Shut up and sit down ! I can 't see him , where is he ? I don 't know ! I don 't see it , I don 't see it ! Oh , geeze ! I think we lost it ! What the hell was that thing ? I don 't know . Neil , I think we lost it . Let 's get the hell out of here ! We 're right behind you ! Kruger 's with me ! He 's seen better days , but he 'll make it ! Kruger 's alive ? [ Laughs ] I think we could go faster if you unhook the trailer ? I 'm not stopping until there 's a hundred miles between us . You don 't understand ... It will never give up ... It will follow ... Unless that thing can do 45 miles an hour on the ice road , It 's not going to bother us again . Why is Neil pulling ahead ? Come on Neil , give it more gas . Come on Jack , come on . You okay back there ? Neil , I think we blew out a couple tires . I 'll slow down so you can keep up ... Slow down ... are you crazy ? Maybe you 're used to abandoning your men , But I 'm not leaving him behind . He needs my help ! Listen to me , what we need is to get to Lowman 's He 's got a ham radio . We can call for help . Jack can take care of himself . I 'm not leaving him behind ! You don 't like it , feel free to walk ! Don 't wait for us . Get to Lowman 's and call for help . Not leaving you behind , buddy , I 'll keep pace with you . That cowboy doesn 't know what 's good for him . What would you do if the situation was reversed ? Wentshu ... Wentshu ... Try to rest , okay ? You think he could be right ? Some kind of Inuit legend ? I don 't know . It looked like a pliosaur to me . What , like a dinosaur ? Yeah . In 2008 , a Norwegian team of scientists found a large skull In the Arctic . It had teeth 12-inches long . No one seen anything like it . They think it 's the largest marine predator that ever lived . This give a name to this thing ? Predator X. [ Loud noise ] Jack ... What the hell was that ? [ Loud roars ] Nooooo ! Noooooo ! Ahhhhhhh ! Stay back . Oh my god ! He just took him ! [ Loud roars ] Hold on ! Hold on ! Fire ! Fire ! What ? ! We 're on fire ! Neil , we 're on fire and the thing is back ! Yeah , I gotcha in my mirrors . You 're lit up like a roman candle , Jack ! Coming to get you , buddy ! Get ready to bail out . What the hell are you doing ? Listen to him . Jack knows what 's right . We have to warn others ... Trucker 's don 't abandon truckers . Going flaps down . It 's okay , it 's okay . You get ready to bail him out when I pull up alongside . Get ready to jump ! Cross my lap , come on ! When I say jump , jump , alright ! I got you ! What about you ? I 'll be right behind you . Hand ! Come on ! Don 't worry , I 'll catch you ! Come on ! I 'll catch you ! Come on , come on ! Come on ! Jump ! Jump ! Jump now ! Come on ! Jack ! Jack ! Ahhhhhhhh ! Jack , nooooooo ! Did you get him ? It 's too late ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Nooooo ! Jack ! Come on ! Get in ! Noooo ! I 'm right here ! Jack , you 're amazing ! Jack ! Good to see you again , Jack . Thanks . Thanks for coming back . Anytime . You okay ? Yeah . You ? Let me see . Does it hurt ? A little bit . I didn 't know truckers had such a low tolerance for pain . [ Laughs ] I guess I owe you a beer . I think you owe him a six-pack . You know what they say , old truckers never die . No , they just get a new Peterbilt . Wait a minute . What 's going on ? Why aren 't ' we going faster ? We 'll jackknife . We can 't drive faster than 30 with that trailer . Hang on , Doc . You 're about see the fastest trailer drop In trucking history . Great ! Perfect ! Just perfect ! It 's completely frozen ! Alright , let 's see what we knock loose . Back there at the mine I left Tyee all alone . I hid while he was out there , all alone ... Defenseless . I heard him calling out , I heard his voice asking for help ... I could have done something . I should have done something . Survival is a strong instinct . Let me tell you something , It had nothing to do with survival , It was fear , plain and simple . Sure , I saved myself , but what about my men . They were good men . I worked with a lot of them most of my life . Good men with families and I let them down . And then when I saw your trucks ... If I could have gotten that truck started ... I would have left . That 's right . I would have gotten away as far as possible from the mine ... From that thing ... What Neil did back there ... Saving you guys ... I would never have come back for you . The ice , it 's ... It 's not the ice ... It 's something underneath it . What ? We 've got to get out of here , now ! Run ! Run ! Ahhhhhhh ! Nooooo ! Come on , let 's go ! Noooo ! He 's gone , he 's gone ! Come on , get in ! Go , go , go ! Damn it ! Tail end 's still dragging like it 's knee-deep in mud . We didn 't disconnect . Hook-up must be iced over . What if you swerve from side-to-side Wouldn 't that make the trailer drop . Good thinking doc . We 'll make a trucker out of you yet . Look like our friend wants to play . You gotta be kidding me ! Won 't this thing give up ? ! We 're the only food source for about 100 miles . Well , guess who 's coming for dinner . Let 's see who blinks first . [ Truck horn ] Come on , baby ! [ Truck horn ] Come on , baby ! [ Truck horn ] Alright , hang on tight ! [ Laughing ] Now that 's some driving ! We 've got to rid of that trailer . It 's Alamo time . Keep it in gear . I 'll break the ice off the hitch , As soon as the trailer 's free you go ! You don 't wait for me . We 're not going to leave you . Don 't worry , I 'll handle it . Same goes for me , buddy . Jack ! We gotta go ! Go , go ! Get in the snow . What ? Get in the snow . [ Snarls and growls ] Doc ... That was close . Jack ! Where 's Jack ? Jack ! Jack , are you alright ? Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . [ Loud roars ] Four more payments and it would have been all mine . You have insurance , right ? Not sure if I took the prehistoric monster coverage . Let 's get outta here before it remembers we 're here . Lowman 's is a few miles away , let 's go . It shouldn 't be too much further . We need to rest . We can 't , Rachel we can 't . If we stay here we 're dead , alright ? Either from hypothermia or that thing out there . Rachel , listen to me please get up ! I need you to get up . I need you to dig deep and find something to live for . Please just get up , Rachel . [ Laughs ] That 's deep , Jack . Besides Doc , you don 't want our little friend back there To see you down , do you ? Come on , I 'm freezing ! What about you ? What 's your reason ? Is it your daughter ? Maybe . Do you ever see her ? Every summer for one week . That 's not very much . No , it 's not . Why 'd you leave ? What are you doing all the way up here ? I was having trouble making ends meet . Supporting myself and ... Covering child support payments . Lost my house . Sold pretty well everything I owned , my rig . Environmental regulations , price of fuel , I was barely holding on to that . One day , a friend of mine tells me about the ice road . Says it pays the big bucks . So I figured , what the hell , I 'll get out of town , Try something new . I only planned on doing it for a few seasons While I got on my feet . I guess one day I realized I got nothing to go back to . You don 't know that unless you go back , do you ? Do me a favor . If we get out of this . Go see your daughter . Stop hiding up here . I will . Come on , about a mile left to Lowman 's . You sure he 's gonna be there ? He 'll be there . He has to be . Neil ! Come on buddy . We 're almost there . You don 't want me to get back without you . I 'll give you 45 trips . You know what that means . That 'd makes me top dog . Oh , god , I 'd never hear the end of it . Don 't worry man , we 'll collect that trophy together . How you doing , Doc ? Never better . Good to hear . What 's that smell ? It 's Lowman 's He 's still there ! Okay , doc . [ Car engine revving ] Hold up ! Hold up ! Damn it ! How many times I gotta tell you , Don 't back it in ! Olson 's not coming all the way out here To tow you out again ... I know Olson isn 't coming all the way out here ... So try listening next time , will ya ? You 're pointing it out isn 't helping ! You 're such a Nancy sometimes . That 's why you love me . Yeah , yeah , yeah . You hear that ? What ? Doc says you need hearing aids and now You got super hearing ? Sounds like voices . There 's ain 't nobody for a hundred miles . Lowman ! Lowman ! Lowman , who 's that ? Lowman ! Lowman ! It 's Jack ! What ? Jack ! Jack . What in the name of Sam ? Neil , is that you ? Beryl , you 're a sight for sore eyes . You look like death warmed over . Come on , let 's get you inside . Where are your trucks ? We need to call for help . Something attacked the mine . Let 's get you inside . Go inside . Alright . Lowman , it 's some kind of creature . What 's that you say ? Lowman , come on , let 's get that water boiling . Lowman why don 't you call for the chopper . Let 's get these folks out of here . What the hell are you guys doing ? Close these curtains and stay out of sight . There 's something out there . Is the back door locked . Bolted . This is Lowman , we need a chopper . [ Static sounds ] Let me try . Hello ? Hello ? Beryl here , I got us an emergency ... [ Static sounds ] It 's the aurora . Plays havoc with the radio . You said you guys were attacked by something ? Destroyed the mine , my rig ... Jack 's too . Tyee said it was a Went-shu . A Wentshu ? Come on , Beryl . It 's just an ol ' Eskimo legend . Inuit . It 's an Inuit legend . Same thing . What do you know ? I have been living here 50 years And I 've never seen one . [ Rumbling sounds ] It 's here . How big is this thing ? Big enough . Everyone hold still . You got a gun ? Gun , do you have a gun ! Yeah , yeah , right here . Come on , Jack , we 're not talking about a coyote here . I took down a black bear with that thing once . It was a cub with a limp . Fiercest creature you ever saw . You don 't understand . Nothing stops a Wentshu Not once it has a human 's scent . Nothing . Well , I 'm sure as hell going to try . Neil , check the upstairs window . Great idea . You don 't have to worry . I built this place with my own hands . Nothing 's going to get in here . We 're safe . Listen to you , the big hero . Do you remember the storm two seasons ago ? We had ten tons of snow ... Six tons . On that roof and we were fine . This thing is a little bigger than that . [ Roars ] Maybe we should just hold up here Until someone comes through . Maybe you haven 't noticed , Doc . That ice road is melting out there . Someone 's gonna notice if they don 't hear from the mine . Someone 's going to come investigate . We got food enough . If we have to , we can wait for first boat . I am not waiting for no boat , alright ? Neil 's right . We can 't wait here . We gotta go . Wait , what are we all complaining about ? I got a truck out there . Two key words : Out ... There ! But it 's close . Not close enough . [ Loud roars ] Is it there ? Yeah , it 's there . I want to see it . I 've heard these stories all my life . [ Roars ] Holy ! Believe us now ? My grandfather was right ! Lowman , that is a Wentshu . The man-eater . Just like the legend says . Still think that little popgun is going to do the job ? Eskimo mumbo jumbo . Inuit . I told you Inuit . I have an idea . I 'd love to hear it . Remember the blanket and the snow ? It couldn 't see . I think it 's vision is based on some kind of thermal imaging . It can only see heat . Like warm bodies Yeah . We can use that to create a diversion . And then run to the truck . Sounds like a plan . So how do we do it ? We have to wait . We can 't go at night , it 's too cold . We 'd be too easy to find us . We 'll wait until morning . Hate to break it to you , Doc , But it doesn 't get too warm around here . Not even during the day time . Every little bit will count . Then we 'll wait until sunrise . And then I 'm going to stab it right through the heart . Where do you suppose the heart is on that thing , doc ? Forget the heart , aim for the eye . Yeah , he 's probably right . If this thing survived under the pressure Of tons of rock and permafrost for who knows how long Just imagine how thick its skin is ? Fine . The eye it is . You should talk to him . What do you mean ? Don 't give me that . I might be stuck here looking after this old dump , Doesn 't mean I don 't remember what it 's like to fall in love . Believe it or not , he was once the most dashing , Charming man in town . The idea of going up to him terrified me . But I knew if I was going to make him mine ... I just have to do it . And you know what ? Not a day goes by that I don 't thank the stars I took that chance . Jack 's a good man . And you might not get a chance later . Go on . This 'll keep you awake . Thank you . I told you , best coffee for 300 miles . Of course it 's the only coffee for 300 miles . [ Laugh ] Thanks by the way . For what ? Saving my life back there . As I recall , you saved mine a couple times too . Who knew a bunch of colliding charged particles Could be so beautiful . The Cree call it " the Dance of the Spirits " . Dance of the Spirits . I like that . What brought you up here ? A gravel hauler . That 's not what I meant . Nobody comes up here to the edge of the world Without being pushed . I was pushed . A guy ? Yeah . It was my career or him . He lost ? You might say he won . You know Alaska is kind of the last stop for social misfits . After the lower 48 , there is no other place to go . So it kind of makes us kindred spirits . You think so ? I hope so . I came up here because I wanted to get away from anything And anyone I knew . I just figured if I didn 't know anyone , No one would hurt me . I could just disappear . There is something about living up here , Isolated from the rest of the world Forces you to learn how to live with yourself . Alone ... Survive ... The only problem is sometimes you learn that lesson too well And you forget what it means ... To have other people in your life . I think I am starting to remember . Me too . Alright , I am clear on this side . Here . Try this . Thank you . When I start the truck , you three come running . Don 't give it too much gas . I 'll be careful . You better . I ain 't running this place by myself . Ready ? Yeah . Now ! Once you start it , put it in gear . It 's gonna take a while to warm up . He doc , I am going to light you up . Hopefully the heat from this distracts it . [ Car engine attempting to start ] I told you , not too much gas ! [ Car engine attempting to start ] Jack ... Keep trying ! [ Gunfire ] Lowman ! [ Loud roars ] I 'm working on it ! No ! They know what they 're doing ! [ Gunfire ] Go back in the house ! [ Gunfire ] Go , go , go ! No , no , no ! [ Sobbing ] It 's gone . You go help Jack . I 'll find him . Jack , Jack , Jack ! Can you hear me ? ! We got to get him inside ! Come on , buddy . Get the spark . Lowman ! Lowman ! Lowman , please . Lowman ! Jack ! Jack ! I thought I lost you . You can 't get rid of me that easy . Where 's Lowman ? Beryl ? Where are they ? They are still outside . I gotta go ! I gotta help . I can 't see Beryl anywhere . I am going to go find her . No , no , no . Neil , wait , wait , wait ! [ Growls ] I have an idea . Can you hook this to the generator ... Get some kind of current . Yeah , yeah . I can , uh ... Splice this extension cable to the tech cable . Give him the shock of his life . Rachel , find me some tape , okay ? Give me the tape , let 's see . This is what we 're going to do . You get it hooked up . I am going to throw it up to the roof to distract it . [ Sobbing ] Ready ? Now ! [ Squeals ] I knew you 'd come . He 'd done the same for me . Help me take him home . Of course I will . Come on . [ Squeals ] Beryl ! Stay with me , okay . Jack ... Jack ... He 's going . Okay . I 'm here , I 'm here ... I got you . This was our home . Let it be our coffin . Don 't talk like that . It 's what he would want . Beryl , you 're going to be up And making your trucker 's special before you know it . Five eggs , five flap jacks [ Choking ] And shot of whiskey ... Try to relax , okay ? Don 't let the Wentshu take us . Promise ? Promise ? I promise , I promise . I promise I won 't . [ Growling ] We 're ready now ! Jack ? Neil ? What ? Without your trucks you lose all your courage ? Rachel , there is nothing left to do . There is no cavalry coming , it 's just us . So you just want to give up ? I believed in you , Jack . We can 't give up now . What happened to all that talk About having something to live for . I don 't have anyone to live for But I am not going to die here . We have to do something , maybe radio . Rachel ... Rachel ! Doc ... the generator 's dead . Lowman 's truck is too far out there . What the hell do you expect from us ! Rachel , there is no way to keep this thing out . Well , maybe we 're thinking about it all wrong . Maybe we shouldn 't try to keep it out . Did anyone ever tell you you have a crazy streak ? You think it will work ? It might . What the hell am I missing here ? What ? ! We aren 't going to be able to stop it from getting in . But if we make this place hot enough , smoky enough It may not be able to see us when it does get in . It 's too big to turn around . It will give us time to get out and get to the truck . It 's time to heat things up . I knew we brought you along for a reason , Doc . [ Loud roars ] [ Loud roars ] We got company . [ Loud roars ] Go , go ! Neil ! Come on ! [ Loud squeals ] Neil ! [ Loud squeals ] Come on ! Neil ! [ Loud squeals ] Come on ! Get up there ! Go , go ! Age before beauty , buddy . Get your butt up those stairs . [ Loud roars ] Jack ! No ! No ! Grab my hand Neil ! Come on ! Come on ! Ahhhhh ! I have to go to him ! There 's nothing you can do ! I can 't leave him ! He 's gone ! Go , go ! Come on , get up ! Get in the truck ! Start it up ! I am going to break the tire loose , alright ? Yeah . Come on , come on , come on ! Not too much gas ! Not too much gas ! Go get going ! [ Roars ] Jack , it 's coming ! Go , go. go ! Go ! Go ! Come on ! We gotta make a run for it ! There 's nowhere to run . What do we do ? You got a light ? Yeah . Come on , come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Jack , it 's coming ! I know ! Come on ! Come on , come on , come on ! You still want to play ? ! [ Loud squeals ] Stay back ! Stay back ! [ Explosion ] You think it 's over ? Yeah , it 's over . How about giving a girl a lift ? I don 't know , it all depends where you 're headed . I was thinking about Seattle . Seattle ? After that , who knows where . Thank you . [ Helicopter approaching ]

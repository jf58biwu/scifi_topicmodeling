 Julia : Chester 's mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be Until we were cut off from the rest of the world By a mysterious dome . ( cows bellowing ) Invisible , indestructible , Inescapable . We 're trapped . Julia : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , But now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , None of our secrets are safe . Can I help you ? ( gunshot ) Well , what happened to me ? You don 't remember ? I remember ... Electricity . A little young to be a nurse , aren 't you ? Just a lowly candy striper . ( flatlining ) You saved julia . Just like you saved me when the dome Came down . Maybe you 're here To save all of us . ( gunshots ) ( grunts ) Barbie , put that weapon down ! One person is responsible for all this : Dale " barbie " Barbara . A warrant has been issued for his arrest . He 's been charged With the attempted murders Of mrs . Shumway and myself . He 's also been charged With the murders of max seagrave , otto aguilar And ms . Seagrave 's mother , agatha . ( insects trilling ) Big jim : We will hunt down the murderer dale barbara . We will bring him in , and we 'll make him pay . What if he 's hiding in one of our homes ? Miles , I-I recognize the threat , believe me . Then why aren 't you knocking down doors ? Because that 's illegal . What would you have me do , miles ? House sweeps ? You can search mine . ( others agreeing ) Maybe you 're right . But I will not stomp On people 's rights . Our constitution still protects them . This is still the United States of america . Miles : No , it 's not . It hasn 't been for two weeks . You got to do something , rennie . ( crowd agreeing ) all right . I 'm declaring a state of emergency . That bastard threatens all of us . So today we will perform House sweeps as a safety precaution only . And we 'll bring barbie to justice . I am not turning our town into a police state Just because you say so . ( crowd murmuring ) It 's not me , linda . It 's the people . All right , everyone , listen up ! This is not the end of chester 's mill . This is just the beginning . For all of you who lost jobs when this dome came down- - Lawyers and-and bankers like miles- - we 've got jobs for you . We 've got a reservoir that needs to be protected , Crops that need tending , streets that need to be cleaned . Yes , it 'll take sacrifice . But we will survive . ( crowd murmuring ) This dome can 't break us . ( crowd cheering ) and the next year . And every year after that . ( cheering and applause ) Man : Sir , the satellites are still showing no visual on our target . Nsa creeper . Man 2 : Finding dale barbara Is essential . ( scoffs ) good luck , dude . Until we make contact , The operation cannot move forward . I want eyes on that unidentified object . Man : Sir , yes , sir . Man 2 : Any idea where the hell that egg thing is , soldier ? Oh , my god . That 's what burned me . Man : No coordinates on the egg , sir . But any new information will be delivered immediately . Man 2 : It won 't mean a thing until we locate barbara . He 's the only one inside with the necessary expertise . What 's it doing ? I think it 's mad we didn 't kill big jim . Angie , we can 't do that . We all saw the same vision at the big dome , joe . It wants him dead . Why ? I don 't know . Maybe so that he doesn 't kill your monarch . You think big jim 's gonna kill barbie ? It sure sounds like he wants to . We need to help him , then . You guys , shut up . We don 't even know that barbie 's the monarch anyway . Come on . Who else could it be ? ( sighs ) any one of us ? Angie : Well , we know it 's not junior . Not the way he ran off last night . Trust me . It 's barbie . He 's gonna get us out . When the butterfly hatches , you 'll see . When the butterfly hatches ? The monarch will be crowned . I don 't see how it crowns anybody If it 's trapped inside that little dome . I just feel when it comes out of its chrysalis , ( exhales ) something 's gonna change . Carolyn : What are you doing ? No , no . Let me see . ( sighs ) Carolyn : Oh , my god . What is that ? It 's , like ... The dome 's heart . What do you mean , " heart " ? We think it 's the source that powers the whole thing . How long have you had this ? We found it just before mom died . This ... Is the thing in the woods ? That showed you alice ? Yeah . And it sent me home so I could tell her good-bye . All right , you need to move this . They 're gonna be searching all the houses . Hide it . You 're not mad ? Norrie , honey , I 'm on your side . Always . And I don 't trust big jim with anything . Especially this . Take it to ben 's . We can trust him . You 're not coming ? I have business with big jim . You do not treat any of your neighbors with disrespect . You do not damage property . And you do not kill dale barbara . Go serve and protect . Morning , sheriff . Tank 's empty . Sorry . But thanks for the use of your car . No worries . You need an extra hand today ? Sure do . Let 's go . All right . Junior : Dad ! What 's going on , junior ? Dad ... I-I was looking for you all night . Dad , you 're in danger . Someone 's gonna try to kill you . Maybe barbie , maybe someone else . How do you know this ? Uh ... I-I just know . You got to ... Get a hold of yourself , junior . Focus . Listen , I got a job for you . Barbie shot julia shumway yesterday . That son of a bitch . So I sent some people over to the clinic , Keep an eye out , make sure he doesn 't ... Show up to finish what he started . But I need somebody I can trust on the inside , Guarding her door , protecting her . Can I count on you ? Yes , sir . She 's ever gonna regain consciousness , But , by chance , if she does wake up and start talking , You need to get on that walkie and let me know . No one else . Just me . Okay . But , dad ... Just be careful today . Okay . Big jim , got a minute ? Pretty busy this morning , dodee . No , you have to come to the radio station . Ah , I don 't want to overwhelm the public With more announcements . My receiver Picked up the military . They 're searching for barbie . Barbie ? They 're searching for something else , too . ( muffled scream ) shh ! Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . Hey , hey . Look , there is a lot of people looking for you . I know , I know . Listen . Everything that they 're saying about me ... None of it is true . It 's big jim , to ... I believe you . You do ? Got a lot of good reasons not to trust jim rennie . Julia 's still at the clinic . Now , if she wakes up , he 's gonna kill her . Why ? That it wasn 't actually me that shot her , Now he doesn 't have me to use as his scapegoat anymore . Okay , so what do you want me to do ? Candy stripers . You guys have key cards To the clinic 's back entrance . Am I right ? Yeah . Yeah . So help me save julia . Junior : How 's she doing ? She was lucky to survive . There 's no telling what kind of Neurological damage she might have . You think she 'll come out of it ? I 'm not a doctor , junior . Yeah , but ... You 're kind of as close to a doctor as we 've got . And I have other patients to check on . I 'll keep an eye on julia . Angie : So what 's the plan ? I 'm gonna hot-wire the ambulance . Then what ? And then we use your key card to get us in , We get julia out ... You drive us away . Okay , what about the guards ? Oh , they 'll swing around to the front sooner or later . No , not them . What about the guards inside ? Big jim must know you 're coming for her . He might have moved her already . Yeah , maybe . There are a lot of ifs here . ( sighs ) Listen . Big jim has taken out every single person That stood in his way . Julia is his last loose end . Now , are you in ... Or are you out ? ( sighs ) No sign of the military for over a week- - Not since they tried to blow us to kingdom come . Now they want barbie ? I told you , all right ? He 's only part of it . The military 's looking for an egg ? Yeah , and ... And I 've seen it . What 's it do ? I 'm not sure , but it burned the crap Out of my hand . ( sighs ) One second . I promised phil I 'd keep the music going . All right , just ... Just don 't touch anything . ( high-pitched whirring and static ) Man : ... On the move . Thermal photography shows the unidentified object Has been transported from the woods To two miles northeast of town center . ( static ) holy hell . Man 2 : Any sign of barbie ? Man : Negative , sir . Man 2 : Any idea who 's in charge in there ? Man : Sir , the ranking official is a james rennie . ( static ) Man 2 : Is he a viable contact for this mission ? ( static , music ) Man : ... Cox , I would not recommend that . ( static , music ) Cox : Your reasoning , soldier ? Our uavs did a full perimeter sweep on the dome wall . One drone caught surveillance Of this rennie murdering the town reverend At the bridge roadblock . ( music , static , silence ) New job , mr . Alcott ? No need for banks anymore , ben . There 's always garbage , though . Joe : Ben . Ben ! Come on . What 's that ? Joe : We have something We have to hide from the sweeps . The gestapo hit my house a while back . Any chance we can stash it ? My stash house is your stash house . ( beep ) ( whooshing ) More guards ? Junior . Doing big jim 's dirty work . ( gun cocking ) Coward . He 's got a walkie . But I think I can take him out before he uses it . No . No , what ? Let me . Calm down , dodee . I am calm . Really . But what they said you did ... I thought what happened To reverend coggins was an accident . No , he was an accident waiting to happen . I mean , he almost ... Burned down the whole town the day after we got stuck here . He 's a liability . You don 't know the whole story , dodee . And neither do those peeping toms With their eyes in the sky . How many accidents have there been ? The ones that you said barbie killed ... Barbie is no saint , believe that . But he didn 't do it , did he ? Oh , he did more than enough To deserve whatever punishment he 's got coming to him . Every one of those people got ... What they had coming to them . They were threats to chester 's mill . And all I 've ever done was protect the people of this town . Think I 'd hurt them ? Are you ... ? No . I don 't think that . Oh , good . So let 's help each other out here , Focus on this egg . You have that photograph of it . Wh-where 'd you take it ? It was at joe mcalister 's barn . I didn 't even remember until this morning . I was thinking ... It could even be the generator . The generator ? For what ? The dome . Look , maybe if you get this thing , You could bring down the dome . I can get it for you . I can help . All right , I can be useful . Well , dodee ... You 're already very useful . But that dome can 't come down . Not now . ( gasping ) Big jim ? Yeah , what is it , honey ? You 're a sick ... Bastard . And one day , Everyone 's gonna know it . ( sniffles ) And they 're gonna smile when you die . ( staticky popping ) ♪ Linda ? Linda , it 's jim . Where are you ? Sweeping the southwest quadrant . The radio station 's on fire . What ? Dodee was covering for me . Is she okay ? Jim , any word On dodee ? I don 't know . The , uh , fire volunteers are gathering , But you need to get down there . Could it be arson ? No idea . It 's barbie . We 've been broadcasting info about him night and day . Jim , I 'm on it . All right , be careful , linda . When you find barbie , you call me . Roger . Phil , come on . ( engine starting ) So , you really think this is the engine ? It could be our way out of here . It 's awesome . It 's like a lava lamp . Hey , don 't touch it ! Last person who did got hurt . All you have to do is keep it covered , Keep your parents away from it and keep an eye on it . Where you gonna be ? Home . I got to stop angle from doing something stupid . It 's in good hands . Thanks , ben . We 'll be back to get it later . Hey . Angie . What are you doing here ? Just helping out like I used to . Are you okay after what we saw last night ? Sure . Then why 'd you run off ? To protect my dad . To stop anyone from hurting him . Do you trust your dad ? Of course I do . You didn 't always . When we were going out , you called him a fraud . Barbie shot her yesterday . Is that what your dad said ? He wouldn 't lie to me about that . But if barbie didn 't shoot her , Then julia 's the only witness , right ? Did big jim tell you what to do if she woke up ? Leave me alone , angie . Junior , I 'm sorry . My head is a mess . I ... I don 't know what anything means anymore . I just need someone to talk to . Someone ... Or me ? You . You 're the only one Who understands what I 'm going through . ( whispering ) : But can we go somewhere private ? I feel like she can hear everything we say . I said I 'd watch her . Just for a minute . Please . Hmm . I need you . ( sighs ) we found her body in the station . There was nothing we could do . Thanks . Phil ... I 'm so sorry . Why 'd he do it ? Why did he do it ? Dodee never hurt anyone . I don 't know . But barbie won 't get away with it . I promise . ( sighs ) I just don 't know how much more of this I can take . Hey , you don 't have to do it alone . I 'm always gonna be with you . ( sighs ) ( sighs ) It feels so good Just to hold you again . Mmm . I know . It does . You taste like cigarettes . Junior ? ! ( gasps ) Miss hill , let me tell you how much We don 't have time for this . Let me tell you , mr . Rennie , How much a lawyer knows about illegal searches . If you don 't have a search warrant- - Which you do not- - you 're gonna need one of four things : Consent from the owner , Clear visibility of the inside , A suspect already under arrest ... Or exigent circumstances . I don 't know what you call I call it just one more day in this damn hellhole ... And respectfully request that you leave . Request respectfully declined . No ! Stop this now ! Stop it ! Get off of me ! Don 't you touch my mother ! Norrie , no ! Back away now ! Norrie ! Norrie ! Joe : Let them go ! ( norrie screams ) Norrie ! Norrie , stop ! Wonder what you 're so bent out of shape me seeing in here . What the hell ? Where is it ? Where 's what ? Don 't play games That damn egg . I know all about it , And I know what it 's for . We have no idea what you 're talking about . Take these two to the station . On what charges ? ( yells ) Obstruction of justice . Mom ! Norrie ! Let go of me ! I 'll fix it ! I 'll get you out ! Barbie ! Linda , barbie 's at the clinic ! Barbie 's at the clinic ! ( grunting ) Linda : Junior , I 'm 30 seconds away ! I love you . Barbie , we got to go ! Drive fast ! Go ! Stay hidden ! What ? Why ? ! They 're not gonna come looking if they 've got me ! Go ! What are you doing ? ! What are you doing ? ! Go ! Go ! Get her out of here now ! ( tires squeal ) ( police siren wailing ) ( siren stops , tires squeal ) Put your hands on your head ! Get your ass to the ground ! Hey ! Get-get back . ( groans ) Jim , got him . Good . But angle mcalister took off with julia . Don 't worry . We 'll get her , too . Norrie ? Norrie , come over here and talk to me , please . Angie was right . Angie was right about what ? We should 've killed big jim when we had the chance . Why would the dome want us to do that ? Look what he 's doing , joe . Pulling all these nazi moves ? Breaking into your barn like he owns the place ? That doesn 't mean we should kill him . What do you think 's gonna happen when he finds barbie ? Your monarch won 't be crowned , joe . It 's more like " the monarch gets his head chopped off . " ( footsteps approach ) You know that quote ? " the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil Is for good people to do nothing . " That 's us , joe . Look at little miss well-behaved . Joe ? Joe , I 've known you your whole life . You 're a decent kid . A smart kid . Not like your sister . Angie 's smart . Throwing in all her chips on a losing hand . Aiding and abetting a violent fugitive . She may be past help , but you ... You , joe ... You can fix this . Tell me where it is ... And we 'll forget any of this happened . I 'll let you go home- - both you And your , uh ... Your new friend . If this ... Egg thing really is the generator of the dome Like I 've heard , You keeping it squirreled away is a very serious offense : Impeding a lawful investigation . ( snorts , laughs ) You got something to say , little lady ? So why do they call you big jim ? You 're just some loser trying to scare kids . I 'm sorry . I didn 't quite hear that . You want to say that again ? You ... Don 't ... Scare ... Me . ( chuckles ) You 're old enough to understand how this goes . The easy way is you tell me What I want to know , You walk out that door , you 're free . Now , the hard way ... Well , let 's just say Your mother has come to so much grief already . It 'd be a shame If you caused her any more misery . Norrie ! ( groans ) I gave you kids a chance . You want to burn with barbie ... Be my guest . Linda ( over radio ) : Heading back to the station now . We have barbie in custody . No eyes yet on julia shumway . Last seen in an ambulance being driven by angie mcalister Away from the clinic . ( drops walkie-talkie ) ( moans ) That really necessary ? Big jim tell you to do it ? All of these things that I 'm being accused of ? I would never hurt julia . You got to know that . Yeah ? What about her husband ? That 's what I thought . Here to report a crime ? I won 't leave the premises until my daughter And joe mcalister are released . It 's a public building . You stay as long as you like . So , what 's the good word ? Nothing on julia and angie mcalister , But we got an apb out . Sooner or later , we 'll get them . Okay , well , sooner would be better than later . A woman in julia 's condition needs watching . Do we know if she 's come out of her coma yet ? No clue . What about barbie ? He 's downstairs in lockup . Good . Now what ? We let him sweat . ( loud electronic squealing ) ( gasps , groans ) ( squealing continues ) ( squealing continues ) ( squealing muffled ) What are you doing ? ! Get off me ! Barbie , don 't tell him anything ! We 'll be okay . Hey . Where are you taking them ? Let 's just call it an undisclosed location . I swear , if you hurt those kids ... Tell you what , seeing as you 're In no position to make any threats , How about I do the talking ? So , here 's the situation . You 're going to confess to the charges , And you 're going to do it in public . It 's not going to happen . Well , that 's your prerogative . What will happen if you choose not to cooperate . Won 't be long before we catch up with angie mcalister . And when we do , we 'll charge her as an accessory To your crimes , seeing as she 's been so helpful to you . Her brother joe and that little firecracker He 's been rubbing noses with , It 's no leap to link them to the death of dodee weaver , Seeing as dodee knew All about this mysterious object That they 're taking such great pains To keep to themselves . And there 's your redhead . If she ever comes out of her coma , She 'll go down for hiring a known criminal To murder her husband for the insurance money . Now , that 's as cold as cold-blooded gets . So what do you say , barbie ? We got a deal ? You let the kids go ... And you leave angle and julia alone And I 'll say what you want me to say . I 'd say we shake hands , but ... Hey , jim . How do I know you 're going to keep your word ? You don 't . Are you all right ? If that man did anything to you ... I 'm all right , mom . We need to check on the mini-dome , Make sure it 's safe . Put a tail on those kids . Why ? They 're hiding something . Something that might help us understand Why we 're trapped under this thing . Something like what ? It 's tough to say , but ... Could be our way out . You really think so ? If we 're lucky . What happened at the clinic , junior ? I 'm sorry . I tried my best ... All right , well , you get a second chance now . I ... Get out there and find your little girlfriend , Bring her and julia shumway back here , pronto . What 's the problem , junior ? What 's so important about finding julia ? Barbie 's locked up . He can 't hurt her anymore . Well , he can 't , that 's true . But who knows what other traitors he 's got out there Ready to pull the trigger for him ? Better safe than sorry , I say . I love you , dad . But don 't lie to me . That would be very bad for both of us . He confessed , son . He confessed everything . And soon , he 's gonna stand in front of the town And confess to them , too . Okay ? Let 's get back to work . Oh , I was gonna ask you : Last time you saw her- - uh , julia Was she conscious ? Okay . Okay . What 's wrong ? Your freaky sphere is going crazy , man . Show us . ( julia gasps ) Julia ? Hey , hey , it 's angle . You need to be quiet . Here . ( gasps ) Shh ... Somebody shot me . Do you remember who ? A woman . Where are we ? We 're in the clinic . In the storage room . It may be stupid , but ... I thought it was the last place they 'd look for us . Barbie and I snuck you out of the clinic In an ambulance earlier . But I-I doubled back and left the ambulance Behind a billboard on the road . Got you down here on a service elevator . Big jim has been telling everyone Barbie 's the one who shot you . What ? He 's ... Okay , okay . He 's lying . What you just said ... Is exactly why we have to hide you . Where 's barbie ? Listen up . Please , can I have your attention ? We 've all been through a hell of a lot These past two weeks . Lived through this unprecedented event . Suffered some terrible losses . And it may seem like the rules that All of us were raised with no longer apply . Let me tell you this . Even though we may be separated from the world outside , Even though there 's no government Beyond this hall that you see in front of you today , Rules are necessary . And when rules are broken ... There must be justice . And where appropriate , Punishment . Dale barbara stands accused of the murders Of maxine and agatha seagrave , Otto aguilar and peter shumway , And for the attempted murder of julia shumway . I 've brought him before you here today To answer for those crimes . ( squealing tones ) Cover your ears ! ( quiet whooshing ) What do I do ? ( deep , throbbing whoosh ) ( grunts ) here , lay back . What do you think they 'll do to him ? They 're gonna kill him . To the charges brought against you , mr . Barbara ... How do you plead ? ( squealing tones ) What is that ? ( loud squealing ) ( sounds stop ) I asked you a question , mr . Barbara . How do you plead ? Not guilty . Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

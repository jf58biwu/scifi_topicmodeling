Extraterrestrial parasites suddenly attacked the Earth . Zebraman bravely fought these unidentified aliens all alone , risking his life to protect humankind and the Earth ! Sorry , sorry . Zebraman was the head third-year teacher at an elementary school , but overnight , he became a hero to all humanity ! Striping evil . A month has passed , and Zebraman has become a worldwide hero , yet even now , he lives in solitude in this modest dwelling . He came out ! He 's here ! He 's here ! Zebraman has appeared . He 's in pajamas ! Unfortunately , he is not in his zebra outfit . Uh , Zebraman is currently alternating his left and right feet and apparently taking out the garbage ! Will we be able to hear that catchphrase of his today ? ! It seems that " Striping evil " was selected for the grand prize in this year 's Buzzwords of the Year contest . Will you be participating in the acceptance ceremony ? No . I don 't see any sign of your family . They left . I can 't hear you . Could you speak a bit louder , please ? They left !

It only happened once , just once . It was just a dream . I can 't believe it . No ... I don 't want to believe it . More than saving the Earth , it 's all of the people who were sacrificed that I ... When I think of how the people left behind feel ... And yet , being watched 24 hours a day by the media and the police , I lost both my family and my job . I wish you 'd leave me in peace . Leave me alone already ! Impossible !

In the chest and stomach , more than 1 00 times . And his bones are broken in 1 3 places ! But he 'd be dead . I ain 't dead . Wh-What the ... ? ! I ain 't dead . Sir ... " Sir " ? He was my elementary school teacher . Head teacher for our year . For yours ? Kozo Aihara won the governor 's election the year before last , Tokyo 's 23 wards , Musashino City , Nishitokyo City , and neighboring Saitama , Chiba , and Kanagawa were merged , and he promoted an aggressive urban program . Zebra City is a model city , with political reforms carried out experimentally . One of those experiments is Zebra Time . Asano , this guy ain 't listening at all . That 's because he 's comatose . Will he die ? If he were a normal human , he 'd have died instantly . So he 's not normal ... Whoa , he came back to life ! What 's this " Zebra Time " ? And he was listening !

But that 's not true , unfortunately . After Zebra Time was introduced , the crime rate shrank to less than half . Zebra City is said to be the safest place in the world . Why ? Balance . Good and evil . We shall affirm humanity 's quite literally dual nature , building a society that maintains a balance . The laws and regulations up till now were made from the view of the benevolent . That is why the repressed evil side exploded , with no end to crime in sight . Aihara ! Damn you ! " Mini-skirted " That is why I made a law that allows a part of evil to exist . Next year , 17 of America 's states will introduce Zebra Time . We heard this from the White House . Screw you ! The weak are simply tossed aside . I heard a song . A boom-chaka , boom-chaka sort of racket . Zebra Q , right ? Zebra Q ? The Zebra Queen , Yui Aihara . She 's the governor 's daughter .

It beats being killed in one of Zebra City 's hospitals . Luckily , you 're safe here , and among friends . Huh ? " Friends " ? These guys are ? Like you , they 're victims of Zebra Time . I brought them here . Many of them came seeking help on their own . But I sneaked into Zebra City and rescued most of them . I don 't recall asking you to do that . I volunteered , idiot ! And having more of them will , when the time comes- - The time won 't come ! I refuse to allow violence . Please don 't speak of my dear family like soldiers . This is your family ? With the world how it is , we must help one another . Sir , where have you been the past 15 years ? " Sir " ? Apparently , he was your student . I 'm Asano .

We could do a nationwide debut there to coincide with the introduction of Zebra Time . Daddy , you 're fine with me not being number one ? My cousin started working as a cop this spring . Huh ? It occurs to me that if we kill her during Zebra Time it wouldn 't be treated as a crime ... That 's good . Can we use him ? No . No . Not that way . Are you Misaki ? The singer ? Um , yes . You 're so cute . I 'm a fan . Please give me your autograph . Sure , no problem . Hmm . She really is a nice girl ... Huh ? You piss me off . Yui ? She was very cute , a nice girl .

Today , too , so many people were killed in those five minutes . The lives of those incompetents ... erased . Doesn 't it give you a thrill ? I ... I understand how you feel . Say , Niimi ... Will you listen to my wish ? Fifteen years ago , green aliens parasitized humanity and tried to rule the Earth . It was Zebraman who stopped them . The Defense Agency spent an incredible amount of money cleaning things up afterward . The one in the department leading recovery operations at the time was Kozo Aihara , our current governor . Aihara found a young girl . A girl parasitized by a green alien . What happened to her ? She escaped . Finding her will be your job . I find her and then what ? I reproduce the aliens . Reproduce ? And the world will ... ? How reckless ! You two make no moves . The mini-skirts and I will capture her . What will you do then ? Eliminate her . They 're too dangerous . You don 't know the horror of the extraterrestrial parasites . I do know . At the very least , more than you . Oh ! You 're already at the last episode ? Oh . His ear came off . That 's Yoshitaka , who plays the boss character Yoshio . Think of Tokyo 's decadent desert ? Think of Tokyo 's decadent desert ? Anyway , the show wouldn 't finish unless Zebraman died , The suspicious , glittering bad guys ... so in the last episode , it was my idea The suspicious , glittering bad guys ... to have him absorb the alien inside him !

No , the real one ! The real one who fought the aliens and saved the Earth . I 'm not with you on this , Asano . I get zero sense of danger . That 's why you joined the vigilantes ? Yes . It 's also why I bring in the victims of Zebra Time : to gather a group of skilled people and have an all-out battle with Zebra City . I 'm preparing for that day . An all-out battle with Zebra City . Will that day really come ? It will . The day to stripe evil will come . If you want to protect peace , you have to stand up to violence .

I told you , I will stripe evil using centrifugal force . There is black and white inside you . In other words , I will separate good and evil . Huh ? That room is an ultra high-speed centrifugal separator , made using the latest technology . It can perform up to 8,000 revolutions in one second . I will use that centrifugal force on people to separate good from evil , black from white . In other words , split people into two ? That 's right . Through centrifugal force ? That 's right . No way . That 's impossible . Have you tested it ? - -Listen to him . - -Hey . Hey ! Hey ! What we 're doing now is the experiment . Huh ? ! Now ! Switch it on ! Go ! How 's that ? !

Please tell me : What are you after ? If Zebra Time is introduced throughout the world , the weak , the useless , the nuisances will be swept away , and the world will know peace . The nuisances ? Rabble like you all ! The weak of society who rely on others , like " comrades " or " family , " to live . That 's " peace " to you , is it ? Do you really think that ? That 's right !

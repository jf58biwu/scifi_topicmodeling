 Julia : Previously on helix ... How long have you known about your tumor ? Are you high ? I had a migraine , so I took ... You 're lying , unless you took the whole bottle . ( roaring ) I don 't want to become one of those things . You know what I 'm asking . Thank you . Alan : How long does he have ? Take this time and make the most of it . Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection . Ah ! This wasn 't a goddamn accident ! I 've got a reply for that message ! ( screaming ) ( wind blowing ) I 'm sorry , doreen . We fought through seven outbreaks together , And I always thought I was the one leading you . It turns out you were the one pushing me . Have you located balleseros ? Daniel : No , not yet . Alan : Doreen 's murder was no coincidence . I 'm not sure I follow . Oh , you follow just fine . But let me spell it out for you anyway . Whatever balleseros is up to , it has everything to do with this virus . If you want to pretend you don 't know that , that 's fine . But I want him found . Ah ! ( grunting ) Who 's this ? Dr. Rae van eigem . I found her on level b after level r was sealed off . She died before the coma could set in . You found her on level b ? Why wasn 't I notified ? There wasn 't time . I isolated her and tended to her needs as best I could . This is narvik-b . She should be a vector , not a corpse . How did she die , sarah ? Morphine . Overdose . Who administered the dose ? I did what I thought was right . So much for not killing the infected , right , doc ? I am going down to level r And I am bringing back dr . Walker . You might want to inform your boss . He 's dealing with an emergency situation . What emergency situation could possibly be more pressing than this outbreak ? He 'll be back when he 's finished , And no one is going down to level r . No one in , no one out . That includes dr . Walker . You 're gonna shoot me , daniel ? Is that really your play here ? You need to get back to your lab . I don 't work for you ! Do you have any idea what this thing is ? What it 's doing to people ? I 'm aware , yes . People are sick . Not sick , they 're dying ! Your brother is showing signs of improvement . My brother barely has brain activity , no thanks to hatake ! Dr. Hatake and I both want the same thing you do . That gun in your hand is telling a different story , son ! Will you two cut it out ? Get back to work . Now . I 'll take care of her . ( faint children 's laughter ) ( laughter continues ) ( girl laughing ) ( gasps ) peter . What are you doing here ? I came to help you . Help me with what ? You ... You 're not real . Feels pretty real . Go away . Still here . You must want me to stay for a reason . Like what ? Who is she ? Hello ? ( gasps ) ( vector shrieking ) ( vectors shrieking ) So , what now ? I 'm going down to get julia . Wait , what about ... She wrote the book On viral splicing and rna binding proteins . I need her . We need her to fight this thing . Alan , we don 't know how sick she is . We don 't even know if she can work . No , we don 't . But doreen is dead , Balleseros has gone missing , and we are back to square one . Jules is our best hope . She 's our only hope . How do we get down to level r ? The stairwells are sealed shut and daniel controls the elevator . I 'll have to improvise . By the way , these are for you , for your migraines . Gabapentin . Where did you ... Dr. Sulemani used them for ocd . They should work . No more morphine . All right ? I need you sharp . You and I are all we have left . If we don 't have each other , if we don 't back each other up , We have nothing . Absolutely . And ... Thank you . System voice : Cafeteria is now open . Cafeteria is now open . Cafeteria is now ... ( coughing ) ( crying ) Oh , my god . What is it ? Your wound . Infection ? No , it 's ... It 's healing remarkably fast . Must have good genes . Must have . Are you all right ? Why didn 't you tell me ? Tell you what ? That I was hallucinating ! That jaye wasn 't real . Why did you let me go on believing she was here ? Do you enjoy watching people suffer ? I am a doctor first , like you . My job is to save people . By lying to them ? I didn 't tell you , Because I didn 't need to . You were disoriented , and speaking to jaye seemed to be helping . I 'm sorry . You 're right . ( pounding on door ) ( vector shrieking ) Woman : Help ! Help ! No ! Not everyone can be saved . ( groaning ) Dr. Walker ? Julia ! Julia . ( hyperventilating ) It 's been a long time since I 've made thermite . It was in high school senior prank . It didn 't go very well . This was no quarantine . It was a " seal and forget . " Dark in there . I can 't see much . They 're probably all huddled in the labs . We 'll never find her like this . We have to go inside . I think I see something at the end of the hall . ( vector shrieking ) ah ! ( vector roaring in pain ) Go ! Come here . Alan , stop , I 'm fine . If there 's an abrasion or a cut or anything of the kind ... I 'm fine . We have to make sure . You know that . I had no idea there 'd be so many of them . I ought to have my head examined for putting you at risk . I chose to go down there with you . First doreen , then jules . I can 't lose you too , sarah . Um ... What are we gonna do about julia ? To get to her , we have to go through those ... Those monsters ? I was going to say " those patients " , Desperately sick patients . If we want to get to jules , We 'll have to treat them first . What if we can 't ? Then they 'll bury this base With us in it . What are you doing ? You passed out . Don 't worry , julia . We 'll have you back on your feet in no time . What are you doing to my eyes ? I can 't see . What is that ? I 'm giving you a sedative . You should sleep . ( groggily ) I don 't want to sleep . Shh . You 're going to be okay . ( hatake humming softly ) ( humming softly ) System voice : Access granted . Aw ! What the hell ? Who are you ? I could ask you the same thing . I 'm anana . Anana ? Where am I ? You 're in my home . Are these really necessary ? Don 't know you from adam . In that case , maybe I should cuff you too . Hmm . ( groaning ) I 'm sergio . I assume I have you to thank for punching me in the face ? You kept trying to fight me . How are you feeling otherwise , sergio ? Like hell . That 's better than expected for a guy who was left for dead on the ice . What is this green shit ? It 's a seaweed pack . We 're not exactly near the mayo clinic , so relax . You 're the law ? Only peace officer within 400 miles of tonrar settlement . ( kettle whistling ) Tonrar ? Means " ghost . " Sounds scarier than what it is . We don 't stay in one place very long . Here , drink this . It 'll warm you up . You 're lucky to have all your fingers and ... Ah ! Oh ! What 'd you have to do that for , huh ? I was trying to be hospitable . It hurts . Good ! Let that be our introduction . Bullshit ! What am I , a hostage ? Depends . This can be as dirty as you want it to be . What do you want ? I want what 's in here . Tell me what you know about arctic biosystems . I don 't know anything . That 's how you want to play it ? All right , then maybe you are a hostage . This is ridiculous ! If you want to talk , great . If not , I can always bring you back to the base and Let whoever tried to kill you finish off what they started . Sarah . Come have a look at this . Tell me what you see . The virus is attacking the cell , multiplying rapidly . Look again . Look more closely . Oh , my god . I can 't believe I didn 't see it before . How could you have ? We weren 't looking for it . He 's using the virus as a delivery mechanism . The question is , what 's the virus bringing to the party ? And why ? Son of a bitch . Hatake : Dr. Farragut . What 's in the virus ? Nothing . I saw it with my own eyes . What did you splice into its genetic code ? I don 't know what you mean . I know you 're using the virus as a delivery mechanism . Now , what kind of gene therapy are you messing with ? You used my brother as a lab rat ! You played with his life , with julia 's life , With the rest of those poor people on level r . You put this place here so you wouldn 't be regulated , So you could play god with people 's lives ! Look where it 's gotten you ! Tell me the truth . Yes . Narvik is a delivery system . But there is no conspiracy , dr . Farragut . That , I 'm afraid , is in your head . As far as your brother ... He was no lab rat . What then ? What is all this ? A way to treat what was once untreatable . Cancer . All five classifications . Think of it . A cure for one of the deadliest diseases of our time . Instead of causing harm , the virus delivers a cure . It 's brilliant . Unfortunately , We haven 't perfected it yet . It wasn 't the virus . Sarah : What 's not ? The virus made peter sick But it didn 't change him . It was the gene therapy inside the virus . What did you put into the narvik-b strain that changed him ? Nothing . We hadn 't introduced the gene therapy . There is something Inside this virus . And I will find it . I need you to tell me what 's really going on here . It doesn 't concern you . Your safety and the safety of this base is my only concern . I can 't protect you if I 'm in the dark . A lot has happened while you were away . Balleseros found dr . Hvit . What ? How did he ... It 's not a problem . I took care of him . Took care of him ? How ? Introduced him to the business end of an ice axe . Left him out on the ice . What have you done ? You said yourself he was a threat . I eliminated him . You fool ! Don 't you see ? When he fails to check in , they will come . You need to eat . Your body is trying to heal . Like you care . You 're no good to me dead . Fine . I just want to know why I 'm here . So , we 're doing this dance again ? I told you why you 're here . Arctic biosystems . I already told you , I don 't know anything . You knew enough that someone tried To shank your ass and leave you for dead . That was a personal thing . Had nothing to do with the base . What about the research they do ? Tell me about the children . What children ? What are you talking about ? We can try this again later . Gonna be the same whenever you try it . That depends on how hungry you get ! ( humming ) They are so cute at that age . What is this place ? Why did you bring me here ? Hey , this is your dance party . I 'm just along for the ride . Maybe you should ask her . About what ? Maybe she 's trying to get you to remember something . Something you 've forgotten . How am I supposed to remember something I 've forgotten ? Nothing 's ever really forgotten , Not if you don 't want it to be . Go ahead , ask her . Hi . I 'm julia . That 's my name too . What is this place , julia ? This is my house . You mean you live here ? Only in the summer . I come here with my mommy . I used to spend the summer with my mommy too . You did ? Mmm-hmm . In a place called montana . Have you ever heard of it ? ( laughs ) Of course I have , silly . Where do you think we are right now ? Yes . This is where I grew up . This is montana , where I lived with my mother . I 'm home . Now we wait . Something like that . What the hell ? Oh ! Have you ever ... What 's it doing ? Reacting to the cold . Extreme low temperatures . Slowing down the effects of the virus . Which means this might work on humans . We need to get peter on ice . Lift his head . All right . Alan , what was that thing ? Whatever it was , the cold slowed it down . I 've never seen anything like that in my life . Sarah , no one has seen anything like that . It 's working . It 's working , but we have to get him colder . There was a lab . Down on level g , doing some kind of cryo work . Who ? Um ... Dr. Victor adrian . You stay here . Get him colder and get him prepped to move . Okay . Key . Ah ! Key . Don 't . Understand ? Mmm-hmm . Don 't ! Do you understand ? Easy ! You want to know why you 're here ? Take a look . What am I looking at ? A bunch of kids ? Missing kids . Thirty-one over the past two decades , All within 200 miles of arctic biosystems and your precious dr . Hatake . I don 't understand . Someone 's been stealing our children . You have no idea who you 're protecting . Or maybe you do . Hmm ? You tell me . ( dog barking outside ) You try anything again , I will shoot you . That 's funny . Woo ! Whoop , whoop , whoop ! We 'll sneak up on her slow . I 'll be right behind you . Don 't be afraid . Victor adrian ? Whoop , whoop , whoop , whoop ! I 'm alan farragut of the cdc . Piss off . Hey ! I was watching that . I need your help . I 've been stuck here for a week like a caged animal . What do you expect me to do ? Put out a welcome mat ? I know the situation has been less than ideal . ( laughs ) Now that is the understatement of the year . What do I get out of it ? Excuse me ? Quid pro quo . I scratch your back , you scratch mine . Do we understand each other ? What is it you want ? First , you 're gonna call off the guards . I haven 't taken a shit without a chaperone for the last six days . Second , I want to be first in line Out of this hell-hole when the cavalry arrive . All right , all right . You help me solve this , And you will be first in line . I guarantee it . Dr. Alan farragut , How may I be of assistance ? You work with cooling systems ? Mmm-hmm . Cryo-therapy ? Vfc immersion . Latest and greatest . Does it work ? Why don 't you say hello to some of my friends ? ( groaning in pain ) Hey ! Ho-ho ! ( balleseros yelling ) Stop right there ! You both work for hatake . Is that it ? Let him go . He tried to kill me back at the base ! What ? When ? You want information about hatake ? Here 's your man ! Go ahead ! Ask him ! Are you out of your mind ? That 's my brother ! Daniel is your brother ? Who 's daniel ? That 's my brother tulok ! ( taping ) ( groans ) You want to tell me why you attacked my brother ? I was just trying to escape . This is a picture of me and my brothers . Twins . You met tulok outside . This is miksa . He disappeared when we were kids . He was only four-years-old . Where 's miksa now ? You tell me , you son of a bitch . Have you seen him ? I need to go back to the base . We need to go back to the base . Look , I didn 't know we 'd be trying this out On an actual person , Let alone someone as bad off as he is . I can 't promise anything . Understood . Vfc immersion hypothermia . Human trials , take one . How do you stop the body 's natural defense mechanisms against the cold ? It is all in how we cool the body down . The solution is taken into his lungs While it simultaneously soaks into the skin And envelops the entire body , inside and on the out . So how does he breathe ? He doesn 't breathe . Humans don 't breathe for the first nine months . It 's a matter of keeping him oxygenated . Either way , we still have a deal , right ? No matter how this goes . Just give me a little more time , peter . Let 's do this . ( cutlery clinking ) Julia , come on . Time to eat . Why are you here ? You 're the one that made her sick . This is all your fault . My fault ? Don 't blame me . We 're all trapped here because of her . That 's not fair . Balleseros : Who said anything about fair ? This is all in your head . Why are we even here ? I don 't know . Pass the cranberry sauce . Please . Thank you . It 's all about you , julia . It 's always been about you . Alan : He 's right , you know . He 's right . You got us into this mess . I 'm not ... I mean , I didn 't ... I just , I didn 't mean to get ... Oh , come on . I just want answers . You don 't even know the right questions to ask . Why you , julia ? Why this virus ? Why now ? I 'm starved . Can we do this while we eat ? You have all the answers . You just don 't know it . I 'm trying to remember , but I can 't . Just figure it out already . Figure it out so we can eat . Would anyone like sweet potatoes ? ( humming ) Maybe the question isn 't why we 're here As much as why are we 're here , This place , the cabin where you grew up . Maybe this would be easier if we all ate something . Will you carve , jules ? ( young julia humming and giggling ) Mmm . Others : Mmm ! Wait , this isn 't supposed to be happening . This is not happening ! ( laughing ) Sarah : Are ... Are you sure about this ? He 'll adapt . ( choking ) He 'll settle . It 's normal . Normal for what ? It 's okay . The monkeys did the exact same thing . The rats too . ( beeping ) This is killing him . Alan . Alan ! He 's drowning . No . No . If there 's any chance we could save him ... His core temperature 's dropping . It 's 95 . 85 . 75 . 65 . 55 degrees . Alan . Can he see us ? No . I don 't think so . But it 's something . Progress . The cdc seems to have had a breakthrough . I 'm sorry for disappointing you . Please forgive me , father . It 's my fault . I didn 't prepare you well enough . I made a mistake . There are no mistakes , only opportunities wasted . It won 't happen again . Good . We don 't have much time to prepare . What do you want me to do ? First ... Show me major balleseros ' body . It 's amazing . Brain activity isn 't 100 % , But it 's a start . ( breathing shakily ) Alan , are you okay ? This is where I left him . Right here . I took his jacket and boots . He couldn 't have got far . He 's been taken . I 'll go find him . ( helicopters approaching ) no . We 'll deal with this later . They 're here . Are you okay ? Yeah . System voice : Warning , incoming flight . Warning , incoming flight . Thank god . The cavalry 's here . How ? I never got the call out . Warning , incoming flight . ( screaming )

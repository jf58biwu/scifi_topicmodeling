 I remembered a joke . It 's funny . A man and his wife were having sex one night ... When their young son suddenly enters the room ... Wait a moment . Are we going in the right direction ? Olav ! Where is it ? I don 't see anything . Just keep going . It 's not far now . I 'll let you know when we get there . Okay . Continue the joke . The boy gets scared and runs out of the room , crying . The mother says : " Honey , now what do we do ? " You know women ... The father says : " Let me handle this . " He then leaves and goes to the child 's bedroom ... He opens the door ... The boy is on top of his grandmother ... Having sex with her ! He 's wildly going up and down , up and down , up and down , up and down . Then he stops and looks at the father and says : " It 's not so funny when it 's your mom , now is it ? " Stop ! It 's close . We 're on top of it . Don 't move ! Don 't move ! Turn on the lights . Oh my God ! Careful . Edvard ! We have four missing persons . We have no helicopter or radio . You made a mistake bringing these people here . More people may die . Sander , we do not know even if they are dead . Burn in hell . Yes . That 's it . All done . Grenades . - Let 's go Lars , okay ? - Yes . Let 's finish them off ! Damn ! There 's a fire here ! Open your mouth . Come on ! You 're next ! Open your mouth ! - What ? - She wants us to get the Americans . Let 's go . Let 's go ! She is smart . Yes . She has control now . Shit . They escaped . Lars . Let 's go back inside . No . We have to find them . Lars , be careful ! They 're not human ! Lars ! Lars ! Lars ! Lars ! Lars ! Wait ! Lars ! Peder . Stay calm . The threat isn 't here . It 's out there . The Americans are the real enemy . He 's right , Peder . Peder ! They took Lars ! We have to help him . Peder they have Lars . They have Lars . The enemy is out there . Peder , don 't listen to them . Where is Lars ? Where is Lars ? Peder . Peder don 't listen to them ! They killed Lars ! They killed him ! Burn them ! Burn them ! Peder . Peder . It 's gonna catch fire ! It will explode ! Edvard . Edvard . Help me ! Help me ! My God . Hello ? Hello , can anybody hear me ? Hello ? Hello ? Anyone ? Edvard ? Hello ? Lars , it 's me . Hello ?

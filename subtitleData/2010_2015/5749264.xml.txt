 - Go . - Beverly Hills . This place sucks . You think it sucks now ? You should have seen it before the quake . Is that your contact ? - Damn it . Copy . - This is Hammond . don 't answer that . You got some action coming your way . what kind of action ? It 's Dext Muldoon . You want to take me now or later . He 's in around the dispensary . We manage to track his vehicle . We 'll be there in 2 minutes . Be where ? this guy is just right where you 're standing . Go ! - Go after Dext ! - Copy . Central is a quarantine boundary . Gimme the melard . Give the overwrite code . Shut it down . Got it . huh . What 's so funny asshole ? You 're dead . How many of you officers have been in this zone before ? That 's what I thought . Rookies . it 's about time the rookies busted good cherries in this zone . you don 't have a cherry . We 're heading into Level 3 . So I have Level 3 protection . We have counters and breathers on standby . I don 't think we 'll be needing em . Why are they radioactive ? Well the quake took out 3 local power stations . Fusion reactors . Fortunately there wasn 't a full meltdown . But they did release some of the bad stuff . Who the hell would want to live there ? Do the math . It 's like Club Med for criminals . Some of the people there don 't have a choice . Sir . the target is Dexts Muldoon . The locals consider him to be some kind of Che Guevara . Do not be fooled . Take him out . You take out a one-fifth of the drug trading zone . Sir . Let 's buck it up . you 're good . good . good . you 're not transmitting . Sarge . Sarge . Right . Hammond you 're good . - Looks like we got company . - Really small fry though . We 'll take care of them . start your countdown . - Yes sir . This is it . - Let 's go . Too exposed . We 're going through . What 's wrong with her ? She 's got .. ginmars .. Radiation poisoning . it can get pretty nasty . right ? Jones - That ain 't him . - Keep moving . That is not our objective . woh . Back up . I 'm talking to you . big fella . We ain 't here for you . You wouldn 't have set up your command centre a few blocks away if you were . Think we didn 't see you . alright . We just want safe passage . You have no authority here . - What do you want ? - Come again . You need anything ? Medical supplies ? I can get it delivered to you . - Mills ? - You copy me sir . Good . have one of your man contact Sergeant Mills down at the Command Centre . he 'll get it for you . You have my word . is to pass through quietly . And what if I don 't agree ? - Dammit Hammond ! Nicoles call for backup . - Yes sir . What if what I want isn 't actually legal ? Go on . perhaps . Come on man . Do we look like crooked cops to you ? Don 't answer that . Coca Cola . huh . I can 't get my hands on that ... I mean we can 't ... That was my joke . - Mills you got that ? - Got it ! you still need that backup ? they 're not even in the building yet . - We got a deal . - Good . Freeze ! let 's papparazi that bitch . this is the police . We know you 're in there and we have the place surrounded . an ... ..... woman . Searching . Over there ! Damn it Jones . Report ! Police . See your hands . I want you to come out . move . Out . Move . baby . Remember that . Oh shit ! . Hammond 's gone lone wolf again . Damn it . You gotta wait for back up . You called for back up . Thank you . You 're dead . How the hell did you ... ? Doesn 't matter . You have 2 dead cops on your hands . Do you really want that ? You 're in no position to negotiate . Who said this is a negotiation . Put down your weapon . What you gonna do ? You gonna blow both of us up ? you are under arrest . You come any closer and I 'll blow his brains out . your handheld has been approved for destruction . This is not negotiable . Put down your weapon . - Who the hell is this guy ? - I have no idea . You have 3 choices . Surrender and live . Shoot Sergeant Hammond and die . Shoot me and die . Make a choice . Fuck you ! Jackson on me ! what the hell was that ? Did you not see me pointing the gun at him ? What were you doing ? You almost killed me . Negative . There is a 73 % probability that this individual would had terminated you if I had not interceded . Interceding . You call that interceding . Sergeant Hammond . would I. Ok . Let 's see how you like a grenade blowing up over your head . He had this on him . He had a concealed weapon . Did anybody frisk him ? God damn it . right ? - I followed all operational procedures . but you followed them loosely . Sergeant ? yeah . I would advise against it . I bet you would Mr. Roboto . One more thing . Who sent you ? I received a request for back up . I provided back up . - What the hell was that ? - Our future . the professionals finally showed up . How about that ? you 're in this . Over here . - Thank you . that 's not for you . - The hell it ain 't . sometimes life ain 't always fair . Tell me we 're not in the wrong run of business . It 's not just wrong . Chief ! Chief ! I 'd like to report an incident . Hammond . I heard all about it . I 'm not talking about the suspect . I 'm talking about that supercop . you know the guy I 'm talking about . That skin job . That psychopatic soda machine . That things of men ... I want you to meet your new partner . Will you give us a minute ? move out of the way . but you 're the best man for it . after what happened out there with that autogun do you think I 'd be happy to take a position anywhere near a machine . It 's an android . I don 't care what you call it . It 's still a machine . You know how you sound when you say you don 't like machines ? Look . Somebody programmed that thing . a secure call sign . And they call it a malfunction . A god damn hiccup . That was a human life . I know . That 's why I want you near it . There 's a lot more at stake here than just your personal feelings . whatever you want to call it many more to come . they don 't require human operators . The brass says that we have to give this thing a field test ... a dry run . - You gonna be reporting on that dry run . - What ? listen . Listen to me . This thing could signify the end of human involvement in law enforcement . Is that what you want ? so be it . rather than those things . Hammond ! I 'd like to formally introduce you to Advance Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Neuralnet Law Enforcement Droid I One . that 's too long . I 'll call you Andy . - You could call me Officer One . - Sure . - How do you do ? - Do what ? This thing 's gonna be interacting with the public ? You can take that one right there . Do you even need to sit ? I can sit or stand . unless you want me to hang my jacket on you . Sergent Hammond . I would be very happy to . Wait a minute . Did you ask for me as a partner ? Affirmative . And why would you do that ? It was suggested to me that our compatibility index would be high . You might as well try that coffee maker over there . Do you think internal affairs sent him ? we got them some bitches locked up tightly in a froze ass in a tsunami . he 's not working for IA . - Who 's he working for then ? He 's working for us . Just don 't know it yet . We 're getting our first assignment . you 're up . We got a report of a jumper over at 7th Street . All the boys are tied up downtown . Can you handle that ? I 'm on it . let me know what it is first . ruining my day . I have to show this building today . Do you know him ? Yeah . His name is Jake Wescott . Lives on the 5th floor . You know . Comes and goes . Kind of quiet . So he 's never excited to jump off the roof before . No . With your permission I would like to go alone . no . My programming addresses these scenarios . yeah . He 's going to feel real worthwhile when we send a robot or android out to talk to him . That says we really care . I 'm not following you . I 've gone through several instances like this in multiple simulations . those were simulations . This is real life . There is a greater probability for success if I were to go against someone such as yourself . what is that suppose to mean ? Sorry guys . Sorry to interrupt the guys big moment . Hey ! You want me to cite you ? you stay right here . - Mr Wescott . - That 's far enough . - I 'm not here to stop you Mr Wescott . - Right . I only want to ask you a couple of questions . Not really in the mood for questions . yeah . I can see that . are you by any chance an organ donor ? organ donation has saved countless lives and don 't you think it 's a good thing to consider from a man in your situation . Most people your age who donate their organs are in terrible accidents and not all of their organs are even useful . But you 're clearly in good physical condition . don 't you think . I 'm not going to donate my organs . I can get organ harvesters over here in 5 minutes . They can euthanize you in a humane manner . They can be painless . Then we can get your organs out to somebody who really use them . You 're insane ! Wow . Can you imagine the sensation of impact from a fall from this height ? Give me a moment . I told you to stay back . - We can go now . - What are you talking about ? The situation no longer requires our presence . What ? I 've performed a micro-expression analysis on the subject . He will not hurt himself . Try telling that to the ... In addition I 've initiated plan to defuse the situation . Okay . What is it ? I accessed his phone records . The majority were to an individual who was not responding . go on . I sent text from each other with the data required to bring equilibrium to their social interaction . Ok . So you text at him pretending to be her and her pretending to be him . So you lied . Each of them received the information needed to restore their pair bonding . Pair bonding ? I have access to her files . Your postrate and moral superiority in questioning when you proposed to euthanize our subject . its been legal in the state since 2024 . Did you consider the consequences that the subject were to take you up on your proposal . his organs . Let me ask you a question . What happens when they realize that they didn 't text each other . The outcome depends on the amount of time that has transpired before this interaction . The further the time the greater the probabilty that they will maintain the equilibrium . Would like to hear the probability matrix ? No . Just remind me to keep you from interacting with anyone I know . - We 're getting another call . - Could you please stop that ? Hammond you got a missing persons case for you . that 's why I told you to tell me what it is before we ... yeah . Why put us on ? it 's complicated . um . I 'm walking around with a 400 pound black robot with a white head . How low profile do you think we are ? you 've been personally requested by the mayor 's office . Just do it ! - Sergeant Hammond . - Stones . And this is ? Advanced Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Neuralnet Law Enforcement Droid I One . Andy . I get it . The mayor 's very busy but he is concerned about his daughter . the mayor has a daughter ? now this wasn 't public knowledge until recently but the mayor sent his then infant daughter to Brazil to live with her mother . He and his wife were estranged . his daughter returned to Los Angeles . So is she the one who is missing ? Not exactly . Your domestics ? All androids like him . It 's a full tissue for us . they work off a program scripts . Robos . Helen Jacobs . who is ? Her body . She 's connected to a telepresence port . You 're familiar with the concept . Oh yes . Robots are androids remotely controlled to human brain waves . Pioneered by ACI Corporation for dangerous military operations . Working in environments that are not suitable for humans . the success on the battlefields led to many applications . and freedom from their mortal bodies . So she is connected via telepresence robot right now . An android . One so sophisticated it can pass through your eye . So why don 't we just wake her up and ask her where it is ? It 's not so simple . and she went into a coma . but here 's the kicker . She 's not aware it is in her own body . She is not aware of her telepresence . Is that illegal ? I 'm told that the shock of waking up and making such a discovery could be devastating to her . Could lead to a psychotic break . she had an accident and she made it out just fine . How could she not know ? Detective . And you cannot track her telepresence droid . She 's gone outside the Grid . that 's where you come in . You can go in there with no problems . what then ? I mean she hasn 't committed any crimes . Secure her and bring her back here . Now under no circumstances is she to be told what she is . we 'll handle that . she is just a normal 24 year old woman . Who happens to be an android . 'existing ' one . You know the difference ? This zone is off limits . So what happened to her ? That 's not relevant to this case and the mayor doesn 't want that information out there . it might help us find her . it won 't . Is there something in her personality that will make you think she will be drawn to the Zones ? Listen . The mayor and his daughter don 't always see eye to eye . She 's a bit of an activist . we think she was in the zones under the guise of some crusade . People being exploited are her pet causes . Her father has enemies on all sides of the law . she could have run into somebody that would hurt her just to get to her father . what could they do to her ? her real body is right here and the other one is an android . but you know what people do with androids . sex slaves . turned into a sex slave ? Detective . before they do . We could check the underground markets . That won 't be necessary . someone with her attributes could end up there . I know somebody that could help us find her . Porter . What is this ? Official business ? Yes . Have you seen this woman ? What makes you think I can help you with that ? Porter . I can make it worth your while . I would not be in business if I turn people over to anyone offering me a buck . partner . I 'm offering you your freedom . How can you offer me something I already got ? here ? He 's not like you and me . he 's an android . 000 . And you still won 't be able to touch his level of not giving a ground . why ? he doesn 't give a damn about you . if you know what I mean . I don 't . Porter . He could look deep into it . show him what I 'm talking about . I 'm assessing his records . I can find nothing that substantiates filing charges . what about his bank records ? I 'm sure embezzlement might offer up some numerical residue that we can sniff into . This individual is clean . He pays his bills . His deposits matches employer records . I do show that he is expecting a tax refund . - Give us a minute . - Absolutely . okay ? You know those text messages that you falsified ? I do not see how threatening this individual help our case . Preferable tactic would be to get in his trust . you need to do a little in getting my trust . Are you looking for results or are using this interaction as an outlet for suppressed aggression ? Results . Watch me . asshole . I know people like you provide guide services for people going in and out of the zone . that 's ... Damn ! That is illegal . That violates the quarantine . This woman has been in and out of this zone quite often . someone has helped her . Not by me . Is that right ? Okay . some other operators . Give me their names . That 's beyond my scope . What are you doing ? This is not working . bad cop . bad cop . it 's where one of us ... - I 'm familiar with the technique . you 're doing a good job at playing mediocre cop . I 'll be at the bar . Please accept the apology of the Police Department for Officer Hammond . He 's experiencing difficulties . that 's no excuse for roughing somebody up . Of course it isn 't . Would you like to file charges ? isn 't necessary . I 'm equipped to accept verbal statements for filing charges . I .. I don 't want to file charges . Are you afraid he may retaliate ? it 's not my way . Okay . uh . Are you at all afraid of the police ? Would you like to add that to your statement ? man ! What 's ... we can offer protection . I don 't need protection . I 'm sorry . He 's malfunctioning . What ? All system scans are at acceptable levels . there 's something wrong . We need to get back to HQ . Let 's go . You 're interfering with an ongoing investigation . It is against departmental code . We need to go . You are pursuing unlawful behaviour . write me up . File charges . Let 's go . You can leave . I 'm continuing this investigation . I see how this is gonna go down . You are in risk of bodily injury or destruction . you guys are nuts ! It 's okay everybody . I got this all under control . - You accomplished a lot . - Yes I did . The adrenalin is affecting your reasoning and decision making . Track his calls . - Who ? - Porter . He 's about to call her right now . Can you track it ? - Affirmative . - Go ahead . You 're not concerned about her being aware of our interest ? No . Safer this way we don 't want to sneak up on her . He 's making a call . I 've obtained the address . innumerous subgroups all fighting for control . Is it wise we go it alone ? no lights . No ones expecting us . We 'll be out before they know we 're there . they 're on the move . Good . Good . Notify me when they reach the target . sir . Yeah . Put out the word . The ones who killed Dext will be in the Zone tonight . Wait for my signal . Yeah . - Still have a lock on the location ? - It 's an unregistered Paygo phone . No guarantee it 's hers . Maybe it 's Porter 's dry cleaner . There are no registered dry cleaners in this area . They 've entered the Zone . Good . Soon as they make contact I need to know . sir . What about the manual override option ? You think you could switch them into manual override ? Of course . You want me to do it now ? no . Just wait for my signal . sir . she is a vigilante . you can pretty much get anything you want . but it 's a price you have to pay . Stay there too long and you 're affected by the radiation . get stuck there . Knows the people she 's fighting for . Relax . Relax . How 's the operation going ? sir . The officers are nearly at their target . about this . it 's always been our goal to rid this zone of gang lords . this is step 2 . they 'll be 14 miles into the zone . there 's only one safe way out . that safe way leads them pass each gang territory by one . It 'll be kill or be killed . is one by one . then we 'll be justified in going in for retaliation . sir . But what if they make it back ? sir . That woman ... that 's not my daughter . She is trying to destroy me . no one is going to let that happen . he 'll take ' em out . why not we just let them do our dirty work for us . Clean up the zones . Officer . sir . Who are you guys ? You can just call us the future of law enforcement . Then I think the city is in good hands . - We are within 500 m of the signal . - Okay . We go on foot from here . We 're on official police business . There is nothing to see here . Return to your dwellings . Why don 't you just call the rest of them out ? than to surreptitiously advance . We 'll see about that . Are we close to the signal ? Within 50 yards . - Call it . - I 'm sorry . - Call the phone . - Calling . Over there . Great . We need to get back to the vehicle . Plan B. What is Plan B ? Can you call HQ ? And now you 're considering calling for backup ? just call it . - Something 's interfering . - Great . but a trillion dollar robot can 't get through . - I am not a robot . - Figure of speech . Sorry for calling you the R word . It appears that I 'm having a block from the other side . So why don 't you just call 911 ? Police services had been discontinued in this zone . It was a joke . You should 've asked the wizard for a sense of humour . let 's just get to the car and call for backup . Who is the wizard ? Stop ! Stop ! Get down . - Helen Jacobs . - Yeah . We 're here to escort you in . Thanks . But I think you 're going to be the ones needing an escort . How did you know about the bomb ? I 've been down here long enough to know that when someone crawls under a parked car they 're not a welcoming committee . - Thank you . - Don 't mention it . We were told you maybe coerced into a sex ring . That 's tactful . it probably would be more of a public relations issue than any concern to my personal welfare . It was mentioned . would you back off . you need to come with us . no . Have you committed any crime that may warrant an arrest ? would you shut .. you need to come with us right now . you need to come with me . Now . That explosion is going to draw everything out of the woodwork . I can 't be responsible for what happens to you guys . Is that the best video you got ? sir . That 's the best we can do right now . - And we can 't get audio ? - I 'm working on it . Halt ! That 's her . I 'll take that as a positive ID . Sir . That wasn 't us . they 're gonna have a fun night . it 's a go . Put out the word . Grid 16 . Headed east on foot . Now you do whatever you want with the girl . But you make sure neither of them get out alive . look . Nothing to see here . That 's not what I see . you 're not our concern . Kindly step aside . we will . As soon as we 're finished with you . I 'm going to pretend I didn 't even hear that . okay . and none of them turn out so good for you . You 're interfering with police business . or you will be subject to force . Andy . Andy . I got this . Look . We 're not after you but we can be if you wanted to go down like that . I could charge you all with obstructing justice . Stand down or you will be subject to force . Stop ! You have a hammer . I have a hammer too . Mine is better . aren 't you ? That was a lethal weapon . That was an axe . This is LA . I 'd never get through the paperwork . and not ring the damn dinner bell . Your negotiations would have been with the same results . you 're so damn confident aren 't you ? Confidence is outside of my parameters . So this is outside your parameter . And you . You 're trying to kill all of us . You included . why are you here ? Okay . Come on . - Woh . - That 's okay . They 're with me . Come on . Ready ? show them your baby . My scan show that the child is completely normal . but what does it mean ? you wouldn 't be able to have babies without mutations . You are correct . Mutations resulting from radioactive fallout occur prior to birth . So you 're saying ... People are not getting sick because of radiation . It 's something else . It 's something introduced into the environment . like poison ? Why would anyone want to do that ? Land value . and no room to house them . it would have more than enough room . keeping this area off limits to development increases the value of whatever available land there is . So who would benefit from that ? Whoever who owns their land . nobody could come in here and see what 's going on . You need to leave . I 'm right here with you . This place is a sanctuary . You can 't stay here . They can 't get caught here . Pick on me . Psst . The major shareholder of the properties would benefit most from a scheme like this . I know . My father . We have to go . Why would you help us ? but ... I think you saved my life . At the boundary . you don 't remember it ? You have to leave now . Give me a minute . Why would they want us to get her out ? Maybe they 're afraid of what she might discover . Couldn 't they just disconnect her ? Cos her body back home know what she knows here ? You know that . They 're connected . That Helen is the same as this body . We need to get her into protective custody . I 'll call Mills . He 's solid . We 'll get backup . Just the two of us . I don 't think we 'll make it out alive . Alive ! functional . We need to call for an extraction . preferably a building would be ideal then he could contact the cell towers to line of sight . Do you know any place like that ? I have an idea . You 're a long way from home . and we all forget . Sergeant ! The iron sky is picking up gunfire in Zone 12 . Oh . Oh . Well it 's about time . Let 's move out . Sir . I want you to notify me of any changes of their status or position . Sir . And I want officers at that medport standing by in case we need to go to Plan B. Sir . son . Copy that . That was the weak gang ? There . Pueblo Mueta . Pueblo Mueta . Has a nice ring to it . One thing 's for sure . They heard us coming . - Are you sure we need to go up there ? - Affirmative . You two may stay here . I will go alone . I don 't get to go to Pueblo Mueta . What would I tell my kids ? not yet . Okay . Let 's ... let 's do it . Go . Go . Move . Go . Go . Go . - Williams . Come in . - This is Williams . Go ahead . I need a status update . We got more ground fire . Looks like the PM tower . what do we do if they contact us ? You tell them to sit tight . Calvary 's coming . Yeah . Sit tight . Pueblo Mueta . We need to find a staircase . Accessing blueprints . This way . Oooh ! You know what ? We have to go through . Ooooh ! I guess not everybody exist on rats . cannibals ? cannibals . Bring me their guts . You can get through us . Hey policeman . Where are you going ? come on . what are you doing ? what are you doing ? Come on . - I 'll handle this . Keep moving . - What ? Hammond . Hammond ! you ! Come on . Let 's go . - Can you connect to the cell tower ? - Working on it . Connecting . requesting extraction . Sending coordinates now . Officer One . We 're discharge to the nearest secured unit to your location . Please standby for estimated arrival . The Commander will be here in 5 minutes . I 'm like him . Williams . Stand by for my command . I want to know my signal . Copy that . I 'll wait for your signal . not like him . Like ... the memories . Have you seen it ? Me . The body have . Have you seen it ? we 've seen you . That . That 's not me . This is me . we know . And we won 't let anything happen to you . Okay . Yeah . That 's one of ours . Hammond . Jones . Out on a mission ? A lot of guys for just a simple extraction . we were out on an exercise . Hammond back away . Sergeant . My micro-expressions . aren 't you ? Well I always get a kick out of spending some time with your kind . Now was that a lie or not ? take the girl and go . partner 's gone batty . We might have to take him in for a overhaul . you gonna end up on the scrap heap for that . You won 't shoot me . You were designed to protect and serve . I may be malfunctioning . we need that manual override . 1 . Hammond ! What .. what are you doing ? I don 't know . I 'm not doing this . Stop where you are or I will shoot you . someone has overwritten his control . What the hell are you talking about ? Helen . Shoot him . What the hell is happening to me ? Drop your weapon . man . You 're an android cop . Shut up ! what 's going on ? His protocols are deeper than I thought . But the droid Hammond still ain 't go . man . on the side of the head . I can 't ! I am not an android ! You must do it . It is the only way to remove their control . An android we can pass through your eye . Sarge . Right . You know what you sound like when you say you don 't like machines . You 're dead ! but the spine has been severed . He is paralyzed from the waist down . When will he wake up ? I wouldn 't call it waking up exactly . he 'll go right back to work in his old position . I can 't do it . Hammond ! Eliminate her . I 'm unarmed . You gonna shoot me ? This is a direct order . That woman is a terrorist and an enemy of the state . I have Directive 109 to terminate her . Hang on . We gonna take you out of here . This zone is off limits . Go ! Run ! I ... Run now ! leave now . I 'm gonna finish this . Get your back . Come on . Back to land . You need proof that the people here are being poisoned . I 've been taking blood samples of people all over the zones . it 's in their blood . I just don 't know how they are administering the poison . - It 's in the food . - What ? It 's in the food drops . receiving commendations for the food drops . is in the food . We need to get the story out there . I have a contact that will get this story out . he is no friend of your father 's . Take the floor ! come in . We need to go to Stage 2 . Plan B is now in effect . Are you sure ? you 're right . Maybe I should reconsider . I 'm sure . Don 't ever question me again ! Something 's wrong . Hello Hammond . well put us all in a start . What have they done ? Your life support has been disconnected . at least that 's the official report . your body can 't function long without the machines . isn 't it . maybe 20 minutes . Bastard . but let 's say the Mayor was pragmatic . Now where were we ? Oh Hammond ! Yes . There is a solution . Give up and we 'll plug you and your father and your friends back in . is not going to make a difference . And you 're both going to die . Tick tock . We 'll be waiting on you . Andy . What is the fastest way to Media Centre ? where your body is being kept . Helen Jacobs body is not at her house . How do you know that ? They would have expected that . They have moved the body . Do you know where ? I may be able to link it to the nurse 's tracking device . I logged on to it when I was at the hospital . I know you have a thing for it . I have the location . Good . We can have the media to meet us there . What about you ? Forget about me . I 'm not going to let you die . Calculating . Look . You think those assholes are going to let me or any of us live after this ? or erase my memory . we have to see this through . It 's the only way for any of us . Turn here . - Here . - Affirmative . There . Shit . Two hundred yards . Hit them with everything . they are doing something to her . Give me ... give her something . I might be able to help her human body . But not her . There 's nothing I can do . Andy . Contact Arnie Miller . At the union . Tell him to meet us at Metal Services . to meet us there . Copy that . She is to scare us out . They know we 're ignoring . Yeah . But they don 't know how we 're getting in . this is where it ends . Officer Hammond . I 'm not at liberty to comment on your status but your father has prepared a glowing press release honoring your services to the unfortunate in the zone . even one as misguided as you . So give up now . We can work this out . You both don 't have to die . Last chance . Hit them with everything ! Everything ! Go . I have a story for you . Officer . I want to thank you for saving my daughter . And my deepest condolences for your partner . as you may not have been aware of Helen 's wishes . she signed a " Do Not Resuscitate " order . but to no avail . We received the verdict today . We lost . Helen is going to get her wishes . She would have never wanted to exist like this . We thought her android body could give her another live . and thanks to you ... The Court order requires that we pull the plug . Turn the machine off . Now . You told me she wouldn 't wake up . What did you do to her ? Your nurse has been keeping her sedated . Sir . right ? Did you poison them ? Do something ! You told me she wouldn 't wake up . What did you do to her ? Your nurse has been keeping her sedated . sir . Do something . go . Shut that off . Shut that off . Shut if off . Shut it off . What is this ? Nobody move . Nobody moves . Nobody . hand me the weapon . no . Don 't ! I believe our partnership can operate on more equal terms . equal terms ? or logic deficits . Human interference . Human interference ? Is that what you just said ? I can 't believe you even said that . Something is amiss with your programming . something is amiss with your programming . huh ? Let me explain it to you . a human 's neural framework . That framework constitutes 70.236 of who I am . if you 're one-eighth of a human then you are what ? a human . What I am is a Humadroidican American . Get it straight . I am sorry that your function will be hampered by that framework . Hampered ? See see . No . You 're the one that is hampered . Look at you . See you 're basically a soda machine . no . Strike that . A soda machine is better because it dispenses soda . Something useful . what do you dispense ? Hot air . Logic . you 're just ... We 're getting a call . Already got that . See . responding . I need you to ... Don 't even have to say anything . Thank you . Best watched using Open Subtitles MKV Player

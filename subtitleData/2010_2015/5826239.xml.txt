 Barbie : A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , We still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , Bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Melanie cross , 1988 . It 's ... Me . Big jim : It 's some kind of energy source . That egg needs to go now . ( yells ) Melanie ! Melanie ! The way to zenith is blocked ? Oh , it 's more than blocked- - it 's gone . You 're a liar ! You 're working for the guy who held us captive over the egg . Pauline : Now that we 're back , whatever 's gonna happen , we need lyle . The dome 's contracting . You mean , it 's shrinking ? Joe : I don 't know why , but it keeps starting and stopping . At least the dome stopped spinning And inverting the atmosphere . That 's why the temperature 's warmed up . Yeah , but now it 's shrinking . First , that earthquake struck , Then it got super-cold in here , and now this . Do you think the dome could be evolving ? And into what ? I d ... I don 't know . Joe : Why is it moving again ? Look , I will figure it out , okay ? In the meantime , spread the word To get people to the center of town . Use walkies , go to their houses . Just get them there- - now . To everything there is a season , And a time to every purpose under the heaven- - A time to be born , a time to die ; A time to plant , A time to pluck that which ... ( droning ) ... Is planted . Thank god it 's warming up again . Well , whatever happens , we 'll get through it together , If that 's what you want . Pauline : Did you hear that ? Yeah . Can 't be the egg , though . Right ? No , it 's something else . ( droning ) Lyle . You should be resting after everything you 've been through . You hear that ? I think we 're all gonna be resting pretty soon . Did jim tell you about what I saw ? A fresh vision of hell on my way back here . Yeah , he did . You 've been through a lot . Which is all the more reason for you to rest . There 's a cot down this hallway . Come on . I 'll ... I 'll follow you anywhere , pauline . Hi . Hey . You 're awake . It 's good to see you , too . How do you feel ? Better . I think . It seems warmer . Cold snap 's over . But ? James , I can tell something else is wrong . I think the dome is closing in around us . What ? We 're gonna figure out how to stop it . And we 'll find out how to get you better . Actually , I ... I think I know Where I might be able to get some answers . Go . I 'll be fine . I 'll send someone to sit with you . Joe ( over walkie ) : Barbie , you seeing this ? All right ? You 'll be safe there . Yeah , joe , I-I see what 's happening with the dome , All right ? I 'm just helping people out of their homes . Let 's regroup back at the school . I 'll talk to you soon . You should take that . He was your husband . That was my old life . Can you , uh , pass me pauline 's journal ? Just there . ( droning ) The dome has taken so much from all of us . Now this . All that matters is that we survive . And we 're going to . We 're gonna give it our damndest . Let 's go . Oh , my god , it 's close . Okay , let 's go this way . Let 's go ! Did I hear that the dome is contracting ? Yeah , I saw it with my own eyes . How fast is it moving ? I 'm still doing the calculations , jim . So , just do what you do best , keep people calm , and ... Hey . Welcome to our new nightmare . I figured out that at its present rate It won 't be long before the dome ... Crushes us completely ? Here , I 'll take that . Thanks . The way every house , tree and square foot of dirt Is gonna pile up inside here , We 'll be dead long before the walls get to us . I just can 't believe that . Big jim threw the egg off the cliff , I 'd say that proves it 's the dome 's power source . No , I mean , that the dome would kill us all . Oh , because the dome told you it 's here to protect us , right ? You think I imagined that ? I don 't know . It would be nice to have some proof . Look , I appreciate what you do , all right ? But maybe with everything that we 've seen , You could admit there 's more going on here . Okay , I 'm d ... Barbie : N-n - Now 's not the time to debate this . All right ? Okay , you 're right . Excuse me . Let 's help everybody settle in . Norrie : Barbie , julia ! I 'm glad you guys are safe . I 'm not so sure . What do you mean ? Hunter , here , has something he would like to confess . Isn 't that right , hunter ? Look , when I came back from zenith with you , I was ... I was secretly working for your dad . What ? Hunter : He blackmailed me into spying on you- - To find a way to get the egg to zenith . Which I never got to do , because big jim tossed it first . Look , I am on your side , I swear ! Hunter stopped that military guy outside the dome From doing experiments on the egg , Because he knew it was hurting melanie . There 's gonna be a lot more people hurt If we don 't find a way to stop these wall from shrinking . Barbie , I 'm really sorry ! You don 't get to talk ! You two go help out . You going somewhere ? I said- - go help out . Okay . Fine . You good ? I 'll keep an eye on melanie . What are you doing ? Shut up and walk . Let 's go . Ben ? Hey . You okay ? It 's over , norrie . No , it 's not . I just saw the guy who owned the hardware store Get his car crushed when the dome smashed into it . Is he okay ? He 's dead . Before too long , we 're all gonna be dead , too . No , we 're not- - Because we 're gonna find a way out of here somehow , someway . We are not gonna die in here . You know how I know it 's all over ? How ? About how much she hates this place is now telling me Everything 's gonna be okay . Norrie , let 's go . Why ? I saw barbie leading hunter away from the school . Where are they going ? I don 't know , that 's why we have to follow them . Well , whatever they 're up to , Barbie obviously didn 't want us coming along . But if it 's barbie , he 's probably got a plan To stop what 's happening . Don 't you want to see what he 's up to ? But why do we have to go home ? Because maybe one of your old paintings shows us How we can stop the dome from contracting . I mean , it showed it coming down . Go , have a look , but I could be of more use here . What , comforting lyle ? Is that what this is about ? His his was pretty soft to begin with . Are you sorry you saved him from drowning ? No , I mean , you wanted him here , and , you know , I did it for you . ( scoffs ) that 's a new one . That night at the senior dance , when lyle got drunk And dragged me onto the dance floor , you said- - The last place I should be is anywhere near him . Still took you six months to dump him . But I did ... Eventually . So , let 's go solve this together . ¶ ¶ It 's about melanie . Is she better ? She tries to act like it , but I 'm still worried . None of your business . I need to talk to you in pri ... N-n-n-no , who is melanie ? You 've seen her around- - melanie cross . Melanie cross , wasn 't that a friend of yours ? Yeah . Didn 't she go missing 25 years ago ? She died . She died ? W-wh ... How 's she back ? The dome , it ... Jim , it 's true- - melanie cross is alive again . Except this time , she 's really sick . When we came back into chester 's mill , I had a vision of melanie in the crater . She looked ... Odd . Like she was sick ? Maybe , but when I took her hand , she seemed better . Okay , then what happened ? Then I surfaced in the lake . You have to try to get that vision back and paint her . James . If you paint her all healed , then I know she 's not gonna die . My visions stopped when the egg left chester 's mill . Please try ! James , I would do anything for you , I came back for you . But my visions are gone . I don 't know if I can get them back . Now melanie is dying because you screwed up , And threw that egg over the cliff . I only did that to try to get you and your mom out of here . Look at the mess you 've made . Have you found anything to help her , yet ? You sound doubtful that I will . Nothing would make me happier , rebecca . But in the meantime , you 'd like to try what , exactly , a séance ? Is that really what you think I believe ? No . We both want what 's best for her and this town . But while you 're busy asking why the dome would betray us , I 'm asking how do we stop it before it kills us all . Have you ever considered It might take both questions to save us ? Have you ever considered it might not ? ( coughing ) melanie ? Melanie ? Julia : Melanie ? Oh , what is going on ? I don 't know . She doesn 't have a fever , so I doubt it 's an infection . Her body 's falling apart . Something must be happening with the egg . And it 's killing her . It could be a bunch of things- - Poisoning , autoimmune deficiency ... Is that why her hair is falling out ? Maybe . Any other symptoms ? When the egg disappeared , her health went downhill . How 's her blood look ? Same way she does . Her red blood cells seem to be disintegrating . A transfusion might buy her some time . Yeah , except if we give her the wrong type , it 'll kill her . Well , that 's a risk we have to take . We don 't have the equipment to type blood . Lima beans . Come again ? The lectins in lima beans , They react to the surface of red blood cells . If we mash them up , mix them with the blood , We can determine blood type . Let 's just hope she responds to a transfusion . Why wouldn 't she ? Has anyone told you about this girl ? What about her ? It 's a weird story . Come on , I 'd bet andrea has lima beans at her house . Oh , god . She is worse . We 're doing everything we can . Me , too . Uh , do you know where my mom 's journal is ? It 's in that box . Why ? James ? I can 't believe we lucked out like this . Thank god for hoarders , right ? Right . So , you want to tell me this weird story about melanie ? Which part ? How she was my high school girlfriend ? Or how she died 25 years ago , but is now alive again ? Excuse me ? You asked . Sam , people don 't die and come back to life . I mean , they can be medically resuscitated , But not after two decades . And yet , here she is . And that is the girl I knew . Your sister faked her own death , I-I don 't know , maybe melanie somehow ... Rebecca , I saw her die . And I know death when I see it . Why the stupid grin , lyle ? I see you have an eye now for your mother 's artwork . The real question is why she ever had eyes for you . Your mother saw that she needed someone to nurture her gifts , Not doubt them . And you 're that someone ? Well , it wasn 't your dad . She sent me those postcards from the last nine years . You know why ? Because she trusted me to understand them . You want me to do the same thing for you ? To make up for hitting you with the fire poker , And for stealing the journal . Okay . Find something in here that might help melanie . Junior : That 's you and sam , my mom and melanie , right ? On our way to the crater , 25 years ago . That 's the night melanie died . That 's not gonna happen again . If only you knew what I know . Junior , we 're all gonna die inside this thing . Just focus on the drawings . I am not seeing anything . Are you sure ? You didn 't paint a vision of a ... Of a new tunnel , or a ... Or a hole in the dome somewhere ? If I had , we would have found it by now . Listen , we are not gonna get crushed in this dome 'cause I screwed up and threw that egg over . There 's got to be something here . Sam : You okay ? Rebecca : Mm-hmm . Yeah , just glad I 'm the right blood type . All right . Give me a shout if you need anything . Thanks . What 's going on ? Um , we 're transfusing you . I 'm gonna find out why you 're sick . Not knowing makes you mad , huh ? A little . My mom used to kiss my forehead when she took my temperature . Did your mom do that ? I don 't remember . She died when I was eight . I 'm sorry . I wanted a reason . Someone to tell me why she was taken from me . Maybe some questions have no answers . You sound like julia . Is that such a bad thing ? There 's a better thing , melanie- - Knowing . People have always wondered about the world . Why the sun rises and sets . Why spring turns to summer and then autumn . Why loved ones get sick . How to make them better . You know , knowing the answers doesn 't take away the wonder , It actually makes it more amazing . Then tell me why I 'm dying . 'cause I 'm not just sick , am I ? I 'm dying . Listen . All that matters Is , the first time I died , I was all alone . Now I have you . And julia . And my brother . It was worth coming back Just for that . It 's stopping again . ( leaves rustling ) Hey , your plan worked . We need the egg back ... Now ! Son , you know I 'd do anything to help . But I can 't make that happen . All right , well then your son and your daughter die in here . Melanie disappeared years ago . No . She is alive . In here . With us . No , that can 't be possible . Joe ! Norrie ! Get your asses out here ! How 'd you know we were following you ? Yeah , because stealth is not your strong suit . Hey , listen . I need to convince my dad about melanie , okay ? So , do you have any photos , or ... I 've got something better- - a vlog . Joe : As the newest arrival yeah , show him . In chester 's mill , How do you like it so far ? Everyone 's so sad . Yeah . Joe : I guess there was no dome last time you lived here . Is there something I can do to help ? Don : That 's enough . How ? Because that egg brought her back . Without that here in chester 's mill , she dies , And all of us die , too . It 's starting again . Barbie , he isn 't Getting it . Tell him it 's more Than just a thing- - it 's alive somehow . It knows us . Barbie , the egg is upset being out there . If he gives it back , This could be our way out ... O-okay , I-I got ... Get out of here . Go ! ( typing ) Is this smart ? He could bring his whole army through with him . Well , we take that risk or we get crushed to death in here . Tell him to go through the red door Of that root cellar at his house . Be careful . The lake 's where we came through from zenith . Someone should be there when he shows up . Look , it 's stopping . You 're not going anywhere . Fine . You guys go get a walkie then head on out to the lake , But actually hide this time , all right ? You stay out of sight . When my dad shows up , you radio me . Go . Will do . Think your dad will really go get that egg ? The dome 'll let us know . Julia . Hey . The dome stopped contracting . What ? I met with my dad And I convinced him to get that egg back to us . Literally , soon as he left , Maybe the dome must have wanted the egg back , too . When it saw your dad was gonna make that happen , It gave us a sign . I can 't say For sure , but I don 't know how else to explain it . Guys , come here , quick . Melanie . Hi . Hey , How you feeling ? Like myself again . The transfusion Worked . Well , that , and we 're also Getting that egg back . That 's why I 'm getting better . I guess when it 's okay , you 're okay . Listen ... The transfusion only buys us some time . She 's still very sick . Well , whatever it is , she 's a hell of a lot better right now Than she was . All right ? That 's all that matters to me . Hello ? Hello ? Can anyone hear me ? All the batteries in these walkies are dead . Ones over here are , too . Barbie , can you read me ? Yeah , norrie , I read you . Great , Just checking . We 'll radio you when your dad gets here . Roger that . All right , we got one . We 're good to go . We sure are . What is that ? It 's a gun . Yes , joe , I 'm aware it 's a gun . But what are you doing with it ? We 're taking it with us . No , you 're gonna put that down . Relax , I checked . It 's not even loaded . Yeah , and it 's not going to be , Because you 're gonna put it back in that drawer , Find the key and lock it the hell up . Norrie . Joe , the one and only time you have ever held a gun You almost shot melanie in the face . Okay , in other words , I didn 't . It 's not Coming with us . Barbie thinks his dad could be Dangerous . Hunter does , too . We need it for protection In case he tries anything when he gets here . You want protection ? Just get behind me . Plus , if don barbara does show up with the egg , it 's gonna be Because he wants to help us , not hurt us . All right . Let 's go . We 've been through , not after the dome brought you back to me And junior . I wish I could see Anything to get us out of here . What if I can help ? You can 't fix me . It 's like I 'm drowning . I 'm looking for shore And all I see is darkness . Okay , you can 't see , but ... But can you feel ? Yes . I feel . ( sighs ) I feel alone . Ashamed . Of me ? No . Of me . Ashamed for letting melanie die all those years ago . Ashamed for losing faith in you . Ashamed of leaving my family . No , you didn 't lose faith . I 'm the one who lost faith . I didn 't understand your gifts . O-o-or that the dome had chosen us . Now I do . How can you be sure ? Junior was chosen to bring you back to me . The dome chose to save me before I could hang myself . And it healed all those people As soon as it saw I was willing to sacrifice . You were chosen to lead chester 's mill . And you were chosen to show me the way . Look at that . What do you see ? Jim ... No , what do you see ? A blank canvas . You know what I see ? A fresh start . So you forgive me ? Yeah , I forgive you . We 've both made some pretty big mistakes . How could you have known those paintings Would come to life ? They were so crazy . ( chuckles ) : Yeah , they were . No , that 's the obelisk in zenith . That doesn 't have anything to do with melanie . There 's got to be something in here That shows melanie healthy . Here , l-let me try and find something . Is that me and melanie ? She looks fine in that one . Mm-mm . No , the way I see it , That 's your mother and me entering heaven together . Just like I always hoped . Don 't even say that . You asked . Sir , I know he 's your son , but you need to rethink this . My instincts have gotten us all this far . You need to trust me , malick . But you can 't even touch it . It 's injured anyone that 's even gotten near it . Barbie : Joe , Any sign of my dad yet ? Not him , not the egg ... Nothing . All right . Well , give it a little longer . When you saw him , did he remember me ? Yeah , a father doesn 't forget his daughter . I remember his face . It was the day I met you . He seemed sad , like he already knew . He already knew what ? That if we met , We wouldn 't want to say good-bye . Well ... This time , we won 't have to . Mr. Barbara , no . Time to do what I need to do . What the hell ? Sir , that needs to remain here . Tell ' em to back off , malick . I take orders , just like you . ( gasping ) Melanie ? What 's happening to me ? Stay calm . Sam ? ! I thought he promised to help . All right , hang in there , Melanie . Sam ? ! What happened ? She was having trouble breathing . She just passed out . Come on . I know we 've screwed up . Over and over again . But even with everything that 's happened , I still choose to believe you 're trying to protect us . I think that when you ... Stopped moving , that was your way of giving all of us Another chance , so I need to ask you for one more thing . Please help melanie . She deserves to live . Everyone in here does . You said that I was chosen . Well , if I was , then that has to be for something . So if someone has to die , then let it be me . Just please , don 't take any more of them . ( droning ) ( liquid dripping ) ( knocking ) Sorry . How 's it going ? It started working . A vision came through . You painted two ? No , just one . Does it show me how to save the town ? No , it 's more what junior wanted . You need to keep painting then . I can 't . Well , what 's it mean ? I 'm not sure , but I think it tells us how to save melanie . The eight hands are to heal her ? Now I know why I wanted sam and lyle to come back with me . The eight hands- - four old , four new- - Working together to make her well again . Yeah , but angle 's dead , so there 's only seven . Who 's the eighth ? I don 't know . Doesn 't matter . The dome knows . Besides , if you painted it , it must be true . Where do we start ? The school . All right , let 's go . ( clears his throat ) ( sighs ) It 's the first time I 've seen you sit still . How 's melanie ? She 's back to the way she was . I just don 't get it , sam . Why the transfusion didn 't work ? Why she got better , why she got sick again . Most of all , who she even is . Her coming back after all these years contradicts Every law of physics , biology . That 's-that 's everything that I have ever believed in . Science doesn 't have every answer . ( sighs ) Well , I just can 't give up like you and julia . It 's not giving up . It 's letting go . There 's a difference . Which is ? Knowing there are things you don 't know And still being okay with it . You and I go face this uncertainty together ? Guess that 's an answer I 'll have to accept , right ? Big jim : Where 's melanie ? Sam : Why ? I painted a vision . It may show us how to save her . And you 're in on this ? All that matters is you believe my wife . If we can save melanie , we can save this town . The dome is closing in again , this time , even faster . So he didn 't show up at the lake . No , but pauline thinks there 's a way to heal melanie . Pauline wants us all together- - the old and new hands . Can I go ? You 've come this far . You ready to go ? Yeah , just tell us when . You 're coming , too ? Mm-hmm . Wasn 't sure anything this unscientific would interest you . Well , if this is a way to heal melanie , I want to see it . Maybe we can both be right , julia . Is it true ? The dome 's contracting faster now ? It 's exactly why we need to hurry . So , our dad didn 't do what he promised . ( sighs ) All that matters is what I promise . We 're gonna make you better . You sure this 'll help her ? I 'm only sure that we have to try . No matter what happens today , I love you , james . Never forget that . What do you mean ? Years ago , I left you . It was a mistake . It 's not gonna happen again . I forgive you , mom , but why are you saying this ? ( footsteps approaching ) Everything okay here ? We 're fine . Let 's get ready to head out . And , james , please try to forgive him . What the hell 's he doing here ? You know he 's one of the original four . It 's a great day to do something wonderful . Stay away from my family . Pauline : When I came back to chester 's mill , I had a dream of seeing melanie in the center . Put her there . Hold on . Put her here . Hey . Hey , you 're gonna be fine . So , what now ? Pauline : I 'm not exactly sure . The painting was more symbolic . Well , she 's barely breathing . Big jim : Barbie , let her do her thing . All hands surround her . Everyone kneel down . Junior , you grab her hand . Everyone else , get ready to lay a hand on her . Okay , now . ( sighs ) Nothing 's happening . Are we ... Are we doing something wrong ? Jim , maybe you 're right . We don 't have enough hands without angle . We have to heal her . I 'm sorry . I 'm trying . Junior : Hey , what 's happening to her ? She 's seizing . Without all the eight hands . We only have seven . Wait . We do have eight . Melanie counts as two hands . The girl she was in the past , and the girl she is now . Replacing angle ? She can 't be two people at once . The same person in two different times , past and present . Quantum physics says an object ... An object can be in two places at once . Exactly . So if melanie is the bridge between past and present , The seventh and eighth hand ... Someone take her other hand . James , you 're the hand from the present . Sam , you dated her 25 years ago . You do it . Everyone else lay a hand on her again . Is it working ? Her seizures stopped . Lyle : Hey ! Hey ! What the hell is happening ? Steady , lyle . It 's okay . It 's okay , lyle . She 's waking ! Junior : Melanie , are you okay ? She looks better than okay to me . Pauline . It 's so beautiful . Oh . Melanie ! Hey ! ( screaming ) sam : No ! Melanie . Grab my hand ! Grab my hand ! ( screaming ) Sam : Hold on to her . I 'm trying ! Sam : Don 't let her go ! ( crying ) Okay , hold on ! Hold on ! Barbie . Hold onto her . Don 't let go ! ( screaming ) melanie ! No . ( indistinct shouting ) Oh ! Melanie ! Where did she go ? I don 't know . We have to go after her ! No , no , no . Barbie : Hey , you don 't know where that goes . You jumped out there not knowing , both of you did ! Yeah , and then , phil jumped and died instantly . Same thing could happen here ! He 's right , junior . We got to be smart About this , figure it out first . Is this the way you painted it ? I thought it showed her healed , but ... Big jim : Wait . Pauline ! Pauline ! In my dream , I saw melanie disappear , but I didn 't know it meant that . Maybe she 's alive somehow . You saw what happened . It 's my fault ! No one 's blaming you . You tried to help . I love you . I love you , too . Pauline ? You know why ? 'cause she 's supposed to be with me , jim . Always has been supposed to be with me . The red paint- - it was my blood . What-what do you mean ? The dome Wanted me to sacrifice . Lyle : So that she and I could be in heaven together . Forever . Us . Us . ( panting ) ( grunting ) ( grunts ) ( laughs ) You g ... You got me . You got me . ( panting ) ( laughs ) ( grunting ) Oh , g ... ( groans ) Oh . Oh ... Thank you , jim . Thank you . Uh-huh . ( panting ) ( guitar plays intro to " turn ! Turn ! Turn ! " ) ( grunts ) ( panting ) Pauline . Pauline . ( panting ) Why ? ¶ ¶ ¶ a time for love ¶ ¶ a time for hate ¶ Why ? ! ¶ a time for peace ¶ ( panting ) ¶ I swear it 's not too late . ¶ Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

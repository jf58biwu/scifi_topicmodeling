 Based on the extremely scientific results of your aptitude test it appears you are best suited to be- - A nurse . Next ! Nurse . Next ! Nurse and nurse . Valuable team member . Something ... Science-y , I think , am I right ? Something ... Science-y . Nurse . Yes ! Nurse ! Awesome monster slayer . Clarence Lao . I want to assure you that I don 't believe in stereotypes , as useful as they may be- - But I have to admit to a little puzzlement here because before today I didn 't realize you coul d fail an aptitude test . Are you saying I 'm stupid ? I 'm not , I 'm not- - But this test is absolutely screaming it . You 're gonna have to take this test again because it 's indicating you 're about as smart as a monkey . But sadly , not one of the smart monkeys . I don 't understand what you 're saying . Of course you don 't . tap-tap-tap-tap Stupid book ... " Planto ... Mihi ... Plurr ... Rimi ... Sapiens ... Discipulus ... " I wanna be smart ! Smarter than everyone else in school ! ARGHHH ! I find that through meditation I can lower my body functions . This way I require less pot to survive . It 's like hibernating until the winter of no pot is over . Exactly . So you got nothing ? Not even an emergency stash ? Dude , pot is not to be stashed . Pot is to be smoked . Only a fool saves pot for a rainy day . For without pot every day is that rainy day . So nothing ! Nobody has anything ! Dude , what are we gonna do ? Being stoned is the only way I can deal with this book craziness ! When I 'm stoned all that blood and gore and guts doesn 't seem too bloody or gory or gutty ! Hey hey hey ! SMACK ! Get a hold of yourself , man ! This is hard on everyone . There 's one last place we can look . Okay , okay- - So , I 'm only here ' cause it 's like a life or death situation . Tell them it 's a life or death situation ! Let me guess The Book of Pure Evil is on the loose and you 're the only one who can stop it right ? And you want us to tell you what to do . Uh no . Not really . And the last time I took your advice , I almost ended up killing all my friends . Almost ... Loser . WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ? I 'M ON IT ! I just need to score some weed . We 'd love to help you , little dude , but the whole town is dry . How can there be no weed in this whole town ? ASK HOW THERE CAN BE NO WEED IN THE WHOLE TOWN ! Well , what 's that you 're smoking ? Oregano ... Loser . Why am I the loser if you 're the one smoking oregano ? It doesn 't have to smell good or taste good . Or look good . It just has to get us high . You 're seriously asking Hannah to make some kind of drug for you ? Well , there are a couple of simple- - No ! No you go down this road and it 's all you 'll be doing for them ! Why do you even care ? Why do you want to be stupider than you already are ? Clearly you 've never smoked pot before . It actually focuses my mental-ness . Fine ! Whatever . Fine . Whatever . Anything ? Did you guys see any smoke just now ? What ? Smoke ? Weird-looking smoke ? You 're weird-looking smoke . What are you two on ? I said have you morons seen any smoke ? Well ! At least you 're consistent . I should be smarter ! I - I really wanted to be smarter ! I want to park in the handicap zone but we don 't always get what we want in life . The magic book told me that I would be the smartest kid in school ! Magic book ? What-what magic book ? The magic book that told me I would be smartest kid in school ! Do you have this magic book ? Of course I have it ! Just take it ! I don 't want this stupid lying book ! I 've dreamt of this moment . But with less smoke . Hey , Jenny . Jenny- - Hey , Jenny- - Hey ... Jenny ! What 's wrong with you ? I can 't find my locker ... It looks just like this one ... No .. She 's completely and totally baked ! Dude , you 're right . What a hypocrite- - You 're a hypocrite ! I am ? Yeah all that bullshit about smoking pot making us stupid and look at you ! Hey ... What ? You 're cute . WHAT . You 're my cutie wutie . Did she just call me cute ? You are baked ! You 're baked . No , I 'm not . Dude , everybody 's high except us ! It 's gotta be in here someplace . Maybe it 's in the hallway . Let 's push the door . Okay . I can 't get in . I can 't get out . Dude , are we this stupid when we 're stoned ? I don 't think they 're stoned , Todd . I 'm in ! I 'm out ! You wanna make a baybay ? Yeah . It 's the Book , isn 't it ? She doesn 't really wanna make my baby , does she ? Okay ! What if making a baybay with Jenny is how we reverse whatever 's going on here ? You 're reaching like crazy on this one , dude . I was just hoping one of you guys would be like , " Yeah ! That 's exactly what- - " Oh , boy ... This looks bad ! Run ! Oh man . I like being stoned , but if everyone 's stoned at the same time society will fall apart . Who 's gonna make the corn chips Todd ? WHO 'S GONNA MAKE THE CORN CHIPS ? Pull yourself together , dude ! That isn 't pot smoke , is it . It 's definitely the Book and the method of infection is obvious . We just need to find Patient Zero . Hey , guys- - Wanna help me eat the happy smoke ? Run ! Atticus , you didn 't respond to your summons ! What news do you have of the Book ? Oh , I have the book . It 's right here , poo poo head . Did you just call me a poopoo head ? I dunno , poopoo head , did I just call you a poopoo head ? Poopoo head ! You have a head that 's made of poopoo ! Wait a minute- - You have the book ? Wouldn 't you like to know . Bring us the book , Atticus , immediately ! Say please . Don 't fuck around , Atticus or I 'll send someone over there to disembowel you and take the book ! Oh I am not Atticus , I am the Pizza Man . The Book is making everybody stupid or high or both or something . Oh no ! He 's infected ! Run ! Did you guys mean this book ? We have to assume we 're the only ones not infected ! It 's a huge responsibility being the only two smart ones left . It 's up to us to repopulate the school . I suggest we get started right away . Um , yeah . Maybe we should find Patient Zero then that way we can reverse whatever 's going on . And then we could repopulate the school . Hey , look at this- - Clarence Lao . This test is from a couple days ago and this one 's from today . He 's exactly as stupid today as he was two days ago , no change . If we find Clarence , we find the book . Okay , but we have to take some precautions first . As long as we maintain pressure , we should keep the smoke out ! WHAT ? Okay , that 's a design flaw . How do we talk with these things on ? Um ... Do you know sign language ? I know this . What was that ? Sign language . What does it mean ? I thought you knew sign language . No . Why did you ask me if I knew sign language ? We didn 't get smoked already , did we ? Not yet . Let 's just go find Clarence . Come on ! ? ? Clarence , no ! You 're raping knowledge ! I 'm not stupid . Books are stupid . They lie to me ! Did you find a book ? A special book ? Why are you guys yelling ? The book , Clarence ! The book ! It 's a stupid liar book ! It was supposed to make me the smartest kid in school . We need that book to fix things ! Wow ! Those outfits- - Are you from the future ? I wanna live in the future ... Hey hey ! Don 't touch that , dummy ! Take me with you ! Bad Clarence ! Todd ! Todd ! I can 't do anything right ! Todd ! Say something to me ! Anything ! It 's up to you , Hannah . You 've always been the smartest person in the school . Well the bar is awfully low . No ! It 's true .

More stupid than usual . I can 't lose you , Todd ! Hannah ! Yes , Todd ? You wanna make a baybay ? NOOOOOOOOO ! Holy Moly ! Think , think- - Atticus , focus . Guess which hand ? Uh ... That one ?

Anyone want to make a baybay ? Hey , Hannah . This day has gone from sucks to super-sucks really fast huh ? Jenny , is that you ? You wanna make a baybay ? ! STOP-MAKING-BAYBAYS ! What happened ? You breathed the smoke and got stupid . Really ? Thanks , Hannah . I don 't know- - You wanna make a baybay ? I 'm gonna need a bigger vacuum . Hello , future lady . Clarence ! You scared me ! What are you doing ? We don 't have time ! I have to reverse the air flow using the air conditioner to suck out the stupid smoke ! It 's the only way to fix everything ! I can 't let you do that , future lady . Stop calling me future lady ! And what do you mean you can 't let me ? I 've been walking around and I 've seen what a stupid world looks like . And you know what ? It looks happy . I can 't let you make everyone go back to being smart and sad . Being smart doesn 't make you sad . Really Hannah ? Are you happy ?

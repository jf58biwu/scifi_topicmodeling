 Let 's go ! Seems like a regular backroad , if you ask me ... For now , at least . Your old man said this road was supposed to be the embodiment of Madripoor 's history ... Criminals from all around the world gathered here , split along racial lines , carved out territory for themselves , and built traps all over , to make sure they couldn 't be invaded by any other group . Enough that even Kurohagi Juo had to be careful with his moves . But ... What was impressive was that Juo didn 't try to overcome the traps , but instead used them to help establish his own fortress . The various groups don 't have to fight excessively , so each side acts as a deterrent , maintaining a semblance of balance . Juo 's fortress has insurmountable cliffs in the back , and Hell Road opening up in the front . Exactly what they mean when they talk about " unassailable fortresses . " Either way , my deal with the old man was to cause a little ruckus up here . Deal ? I keep Kurohagi occupied , while he and his pals use a secret underground path to get into the Dragon Palace . That 's our deal . Secret underground path — ? So , how do Kurohagi and his goons get in and out of the Dragon Palace ? They got some kinda special permit that keeps ' em safe on Hell Road ? They just fly . Although unidentified helicopters and jets are shot down ... Yeah , I bet . What the — ! ? I get it now ... This is ... Need me to spell it out for you ? Basically ... We gotta do this ! I got my hands full , so you take care of the rear ! You think you have to tell me to defend myself ! ? I guess not ! We 're gonna push on through ! It 's not like there 's any other options ! I guess that was pretty historical after all , considering how low-tech those traps were . I guess I should thank you , but , we 're not in the clear yet , unfortunately . I wasn 't expecting kind words outta you anyway . What 's wrong , Min ? Oh , it 's nothing . Master Koh ! Logan has started down Hell Road . Finally ... If we had been alone , it would have been suicide . But with his help , we 'll succeed ! Min . Are you worried that we lied to Logan about the secret underground path ? No ... it was all your plan , Master Koh , so ... Um , sir ... Miss Yukio is with him . This island needs to be cleansed . We must obliterate everything that Kurohagi Juo has built , reducing his accomplishments to ash . Sacrifices will be necessary to do that . Master Koh ... Damn , what a cliché ... Pretty effective , though . I just didn 't expect anything so old fashioned ... Look ! More locals ... We better get out of here in a ... hurry ! I agree . Damn ! Yukio ! Had to claw my way out , so it took a while , but ... you feeling any more grateful now ? What are you talking about ? You were only able to get out safely because I kept them busy . What a broad ... What now ! ? We probably triggered something else . These guys had a real thing for pointy objects . You were revered as the guardian of this island , and even the marauders from Hell Road would steer clear of you ... But you come back without being able to kill Logan ? I ought to have you broken apart . Well , I 've asked A.I.M. to upgrade you , so stay in your cell for now . There 's no room for failure next time , so you had better — Mr. Kurohagi ! What ! ? Logan 's on his way , via Hell Road . He 's passed the first gate . What was that — ! ? Let the guests know we 're starting the ceremony immediately ! Yes , sir ! Logan ... If she 's still worried about him , she 's even dumber than I thought . Perfect for a political marriage ... Logan ... Again ! ? Kill ' em all ! Now what ! ? Because one group 's traps have all been taken out , the power balance has been upset ! I wonder where Logan is — ? I hope he makes it , but ... We 've waited so long ... If he disrupts the ceasefire on Hell Road , there 's going to be a bloodbath . And Miss Yukio is with him ? Master Koh must be ... Master Koh has braced himself for this ! We need to follow his lead ! Stop gossiping and — Min ! We march . We 're almost there ! We still have to make our way up the building ! The ground ! It 's liquefied ! ? The groundwater must have seeped through the ground ... What now ! ? So that 's how it is , eh ? I guess they 're not joking . Are you all ready ? Yes , Master Koh ! We can enter Hell Road through here . Alright , open it up ! Amazing ... We would 've all been done for ... Let 's move ! Right ! The remains of the people who went down Hell Road ... and never came back . They 're getting closer ! I hate being kept in suspense ! At this rate — ! Yeah , we 'll get sliced up like a ham . No more jokes ! Time to get crazy ! Grab on ! Move onward ! Yes , Master Koh ! That 's — Min ! ? And the old man ! ? What happened to the secret underground tunnel ! ? Yeah , I guess I get it now . I was the minesweeper for Hell Road ! The old fart lied to me ! That 's just how he is . Master Koh ! Hey ! Quit wasting time ! Let 's go ! Mariko . My , my , such a dusty little island . Kikyo ! I don 't got time to play with you ! Kikyo ! How 'd you get even stronger ! ? Master Koh ! Stop ! Next time on Wolverine ... Shingen .

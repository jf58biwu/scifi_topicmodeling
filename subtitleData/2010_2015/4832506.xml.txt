 ♪ Two ... two , three ... ♪ people , as company bureaucrat , I will today be conducting the annual performance review . With a twist . Oh , no . The firing tie . Correct . I will be evaluating each of you , and the lowest-rated employee , possibly Zoidberg , will be fired at sundown . Zoidberg . Classic Hermes . Let the interviews begin . Good luck , everybody but Zoidberg . My primary duties ? Well , I assist the Professor in whatever important research he happens to be engaged in . Uh , yes , sir , I will be sure to snore that science lamp right away . Now , Leela , couldn 't we just fire you and have Fry or Bender fly the ship ? Not if you stand on their air hose much longer . Noted . My job ? Toilets ' n ' boilers , boilers ' n ' toilets . Plus that one boiling toilet . Fire me iffen you dare . Now , then , while many of you do half-ass jobs and the rest do jobs whose ass ratio ranges from 42 % to a mere 11 % , only the most pathetically useless employee will be fired today . And that employee is ... Hermes Conrad . What ? ! No way ! Hermes , no ! Yes . My performance review proves the main drag on our profit is the time I waste on performance reviews . But you can 't fire yourself now . We were just getting to know each other . I 've already notified the central bureaucracy . They 'll be here two seconds ago . I suppose you 're here to tell me to pack it in ? Only if you buy me dinner first . I 'm being fired . I don 't think it 's appropriate to joke around like that . You 're right , Hermes . Meet mark 7-G , the machine who 's replacing you . I 'm mark 7-G , the machine who 's replacing you . Will you be conducting an exit interview ? Well , I wouldn 't say no to a little friendly debriefing . Bureaucrat Conrad , you are ordered to relieve yourself of duty . Sounds like a party . Good-bye . Well , this is it . But I want you to know working here has been the experience of a lifetime . Off you go . So , I hear you 're a machine ... ow ! Traitor ! My friend 's ample tuchus is barely out the door , and you 're already schmoozing up to his replacement ? Um , Zoidberg ? I don 't think Hermes really liked you . In fact , he hated you more than anyone ever hated anyone . What , you mean the remarks and the hits ? That was just friend teasing . Oy . You don 't understand . He was the only one who cared enough to insult me . I insult you , you fat sack . Sure , when it 's convenient . But Hermes was always there for me . And now he 's gone , thanks to you , Mr. bigshot 7-G . I 'll never see Hermes again . On the bright side , I 'll never see Zoidberg again . Aw , there , there , husband . I made your favorite , curried goat . It better be spicy . Well played . Ows . Ah . Fire . Aah ! It burns ! It burns ! Hmm , not bad . Needs a little hot sauce . I just don 't know how we 'll get by . Then I guess this wouldn 't be a good time to tell you that I 'm pregnant . What ? ! And you 're not the father . No ! I 'm just joking , husband . See now ? Things don 't seem so bad any more , do they ? You 're right . Thank you , Labarbara . Oh , also , I wrecked the car . This here is a mugging ! Hand over your skin . My ebony splendor ? Me don 't think so . I said hand it over . I 'm hungry ! Ha-haw ! Ha-haw ! For God 's sake , woman , just give him your skin ! Can 't you see he 's crazy ? ! You calling me cra ... zy ? ! Ain 't nothing crazy about me but my brain . Right , brain ? Right ! No , not you , right brain . Right , left brain ? Right ! Okay , then . Ha-haw ! Do something , Hermes . I can 't ! When I fight machinery , machinery always wins ! Freeze , bagwad . You 're under arrest for attempted epidermicide . I 'm coming for you , man . Ain 't no jail can hold me . That 's why you 're going straight to the electromagnetic chair . And then I 'm-a stab it . Ha-haw ! S-s-stop ! It 's driving me sane ! Hey , Bender , you should become an executioner . You could kill humans and wear a cool hood . Nah , I like my victims to know who did it . Psst ! Hermes ! Boy , am I indifferent to see you . We need to talk ... alone . Okay , Hermes . Sure . Fry , could you come in here and help me rub on this new scented body oil ? In a second . I 'm eavesdropping . Please , Fry ? Leela punishes me when I don 't use enough . I said not now ! Sure , I know a guy . Yuri here runs the most sanitary surgical implant parlor in Filthytown . So , I hear you 're an expert in the shadowy field of " body augmentation " . I am expert in shadowy field of many things . I need something that 'll make me less inferior to today 's modern machinery . Can you help me ? No problem . I prepare operating room . Oh , honey , I 'm home ! Pops ? ! Is that a harpoon in your chest ? Yes . And I 'm happy to see you . Mmm ... And the best part is , the whole package fits neatly in the space where my giblets used to be . I 'm kind of a harpoon snob , and let me say , that thing is gorgeous . But do you really need chest artillery ? It 's not just a weapon . It 's the bureaucrat 's best friend . Observe . Oh , mark 7-g ? Would you mind fetching that carton from the top shelf ? Pitiful and sickening . Okay , little man , let a professional bureaucrat show you how it 's done . My best wasn 't good enough . I 'll need my personnel file , please . Welcome back , old friend . I missed you terribly . You do everything terribly . And I 'm not your friend . Good old Hermes . When he stops insulting , that 's when I worry . Oh , dear ! I was leaning over the sink eating pureed clams when my teeth fell in the disposal . Scruffy , could you retrieve them ? 'Taint a boiler nor a toilet . Pass . I 'll fetch my hand tools . Hand tools ? Why don 't you get an extendo-arm implant , like mine ? Oh , no . No more implants . I don 't want to end up a cold , emotionless machine like you . That 's sweet , Hermes . Maybe I should get an extendo-arm . How long will it take to install an extendo-arm ? I have golf game in half-hour , so ... half-hour . Thank you , Hermes . I don 't know . It seems like a lot of trouble to cut off your arm just to snake a drain . Ah-ah-ah , it 's not just a drain snake . It comes with a set of interchangeable accessories . Jackhammer ... Vegetable peeler ... Pipe-bending jig . A machine that can bend ? No way . But , Hermes , old friend , didn 't you say you were through with the implants ? Oh , don 't be such a spoilsport . Such a mild insult . That 's not my Hermes . Speaking of ... What happened to your cutoff body parts anyhow ? Right here . I was going to donate them to the salvation air force , but they 're starting to rot . Then I 'll just take them and , uh , throw them away , shall I why not ? Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo , whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo ! Nyah-ah-ah . So , friend , welcome to my home . I 'm very proud of it . But I want to hear what you think . " Oh , mon , I 'm Hermes , and I think it stinks in here like a green snake , or something else that 's Jamaican . " Good one at my expense , Hermes . Mmm , well , I must admit it 's not bad . And it will cut two or three hours a day off my cornrowing routine . Yes , our lives will never be the same . Darn it ! I 'll be right back . Ooh ! Hermes , oh , you foolish man , what do you need a cylon eye for ? Now , calm down , dear . You know , you look even hotter in infrared . Aah ! Husband , some things were not meant to be cylonned . Now , you must promise me you won 't be getting any more upgrades . I promise . Wow . Nice , shiny metal ass , Hermes . So , with all these implants , what exactly is the difference between you and a robot ? I still have one thing no robot shall ever have ... a good old flesh-and - blood human brain . Yes , a big , smart brain . Not like dum-dum Zoidberg , right , Hermes ? Right ? Mecha-Hermes has no interest in such nonsense . Uh , Mr. Conrad , did you remember to save the trimmings for me ? Yes , yes , doctor . Right here . Wait . You 're not eating my discarded flesh , are you ? How could you even ask such a thing ? Of course , I tried eating you , but your flesh was too spicy . Thanks to years of Labarbara 's curried goat , no doubt . But my mecha-stomach has no need of goat . Mecha-Hermes has spoken ! Mecha-Hermes still wants to know what you 're doing with his pieces . Something wonderful . Give it way up for Dr. Zoidberg and little Hermes . Hello . Hello . So , little Hermes , did you hear I 've taken up running ? " Yeah , from restaurant to restaurant . Ho ho , mon . " " Seriously , though , have you lost weight ? " Yes . " Looks like you found it again . " Oh , boy . That was quite a zinger , old friend . " I 'm not your friend . I 'm out of here the second you let go of my bowels . " Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . I 'll be here all week . " You 've been warned , people . " He 's good . I can only see one of his four mouth-tendrils moving . So , Mr. Conrad , did you enjoy the show ? Alas , no . Seeing what I once was filled me with regret . You could always undo your implants . Regret that I still have one human part . That meat puppet disgusts me . It 's time for the ultimate upgrade . But the only thing you haven 't upgraded is your brain . Exactly . Oops . Robot brain implant ? Never . No one in right mind would do that . Ah , a freshly dug robot grave . Let 's exhume-a-zoom-zoom . Step aside . Bing-reka ! The brain circuit . Come , fellows . Let 's go home and install it . Enjoy eternity without your brain , anonymous dead robot . So , little Hermes , are you ready to watch some brain surgery ? " I 'm ready to shoot myself if it 'll get me off your lap . " Open the dome and unleash the power of the heavens ! Ah , now I can see what I 'm doing . Commence the operation ! Terminate the operation . Labarbara ? Dwight ? I just got an urgent text from little Hermes . You can 't do this thing . You don 't even know whose brain that is . It doesn 't matter . Any robot brain will improve my fitness as a husband and father . You can 't be a husband and father if you don 't have a wife and son . Wait . I care about you too much to lose you . But my new robot brain won 't . Commence the operation . Well you 'll have to commence it without me , Hermes . And commence living without me . Because I will commence divorce proceedings . Oh , I hope to God I 'm using that word correctly . Oh , I can 't do this , Hermes . Your wife 's moving plea has made me realize you might have litigious survivors . Oh , thank you , Professor . Come now . Let 's go try that Korean noodle place you were telling me about . There will be no noodles until the operation is complete . You can 't force me to operate . Maybe not , but perhaps I can encourage you with my encouragement drill . Wait . I 'll perform the surgery . You ? With those clumsy claws ? It 's true , old friend . My claws are too clumsy for such delicate work . " But mine aren 't . " You , mon , give me that robot brain . And you , metal guy , lie down . Zoidberg , this makes no sense . Why are you helping him ? And what 's that catchy beat ? I 'll tell you . Two , three ... ♪ I was lonesome for my friend a minute ago ♪ ♪ When a happy thought dispelled my woe ♪ ♪ And I felt perhaps he 'd be a bit less dull ♪ ♪ If I sliced up his cyborg skull ♪ ♪ He wants a brain ♪ he wants a robot brain ♪ another brain ♪ let 's see if he feels pain ♪ ♪ A brand-new brain ♪ it might drive him insane ♪ he wants a brain ♪ he wants a robot brain ♪ wa-ooh ♪ wa-wa-ooh ... Does anyone else find it freaky that Zoidberg is singing harmony with himself ? Oh , loosen up , Amy . My condolences , Labarbara . I hope you find some comfort in staring at this throbbing mass of nerve tissue . Oh , he 's gone ! Oh , Zoidberg , what have you done ? I 'll tell you what I 've done . I 've brought your husband back . Pops . Sweet reawakenin ' ... Of me , a Jamaican-in . Hermes , you 're alive . And practically rhyming . Wife , son , I am so sorry . Once I started upgrading myself , I lost all control . But I see now that if you can 't be man enough with your own parts , no amount of machinery will help . Not so fast . But faster than that ! It 's that insane robot , Roberto . Quick , Hermes , the keys . I left them in my other body . Oh , yeah . And I 'm-a stick ' em in your pancreas till I find one that opens it . I 'm gonna peel off your skin and eat it like pencil shavings . Ow ! Thank God Zoidberg didn 't reattach my nerves . Mmm , that 's tasty . Too tasty . It burns . It ... it burns ! What 's happening ? The spicy curried goat . Hermes ' skin is so saturated with it that it 's dissolving the bad robot . In the end , all his implants were no match for my wife 's reckless seasoning . Now , husband , don 't you think you owe Zoidberg a thank-you for saving you from yourself ? But I hate him . Honey , we all do . But fair is fair . Zoidberg , I ... I know we have never been friends , but I appreciate what you did . Thank you . Never been friends ? Ouch ! What a zinger . Well , here 's one for you , Mr. not-my-friend Conrad . You acted like a big jerk . You were selfish and stupid , and you don 't deserve a wife like Labarbara or a friend like me . It 's funny because it 's mean . Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . I 'll be here forever . ♪ Wa-ooh ♪ wa-wa-ooh ... Ugh . He 's doing it again . ♪ Wa-wa-ooh , wa-wa-ooh ...

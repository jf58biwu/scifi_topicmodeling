 ( Theme music playing ) What can you see ? How far down does it go ? All the way to the other side of the world . - Buenos Aires . - Shanghai . A mission on both sides of the world ? And you 're taking me with you . Whoa . I never knew about that . I think it 's showing us the way . It 's The Blessing . It 's somewhere over there , and I think it 's calling you , Jack . When I was about five or six my dad came home from work early and I knew there was something wrong . I could hear voices from the kitchen . So I looked through the door and ... I could see him crying . It turns out money had gone missing from work and he 'd got the blame . So I went to get all my pocket money and I put it in his hand . It must 've been about £ 2.50 . And he looked at me and he said , " It 's not about the money . " He said , " I can 't stand anyone thinking I 'm not an honest man . " And I will always remember that- - always- - 'cause that was the first time in my life anybody had spoken to me like an adult . And then we went to the back garden and we played till dark . So that 's my dad , Geraint Wyn Cooper , the nicest man in the world . And today 's the day that I kill him . ( Theme music playing ) ( Beeping ) ♪ Torchwood : Miracle Day 4x10 ♪ The Blood Line Original Air Date on September 9 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = Whoa . - Oh my God . - All right , that 's it . I 'm done . You know , I 've seen some crazy shit with Torchwood , but now I 'm at the limit . So we 've got blood heading northwest 15 ° 38 ' 39 " North . What have you got ? Uh , it 's heading southeast 23 ° 6 ' 4 " South . You keep that blood safe . They 've destroyed blood banks in both cities . - That 's got to be important . - I 've got it . It 's safe . Who was that ? Is that World War II ? What 's wrong ? It feels like all the blood inside me is trying to get out , churning . - Tell me about it . - Why ? What 's wrong with you ? You 're not the only one affected by the miracle . It saved Rex 's life and we don 't know what happens next if we stop this thing . - Maybe death catches up with him . - Okay okay . Enough with the superstition . Let 's get back to the mission , people . If both cities are connected underground , - It 's like a pole . - A secondary pole . The magnetic pole goes north to south , and now this , from Buenos Aires to Shanghai . What is it ? Forgive me , but according to our contacts there are forces moving in , so we 're advancing the plan . Midnight tonight , long after we 're gone , we 're blowing this whole thing sky high . Won 't that stop the Miracle ? On the contrary , it 'll become never-ending . The Blessing won 't be hurt , just buried so that no one can ever change it again . I 'm gonna follow . If I keep going 15 ° 38 ' north , I 'll find it . Wait for my call . And Rex , Esther , you take care , okay ? You never know . We might meet in the middle . Yeah , well , I guess there 's a first time for everything . Good luck . And hey , you take care . Don 't do those stupid , lame-ass Torchwood things . - Be professional for once . - Like you taught me , yeah ? Yeah , that 's right- - just like I taught you . See you soon , yeah ? When all this is over . Speaking as a man who 's walked to his death , can I say I did it with a lot less sentiment ? Just you wait . If this goes right , murder 's coming back . Jack , listen to me . I 've got no choice now . I need to bring in the C.I.A. for backup , because if we find this place , we 're gonna have to move in and take it fast and hard . Don 't give away our location . Keep Torchwood a secret . - Promise ? - Sure . And hey , let 's meet up for drinks afterwards . Well , you always wanted to be a part of clandestine , didn 't you ? Well , you just got promoted . Yeah , this is Rex Matheson . Ladies and gentlemen , as of this moment clandestine is running this room . I am declaring special ops , station 1 , as designated by field Agent Rex Matheson . Adam , secure linkup . Charlotte , we 're gonna need translation in this room now . Yes , sir . What language ? Spanish . We need experts in rioplatense Spanish . Now listen up , everybody . It 's 11 : 09 a.m. in D.C. , 12 : 09 p.m. in Buenos Aires . To confirm , this operation is active in Buenos Aires . Buenos Aires , this is Shanghai . We 're setting detonation at 12 : 00 midnight . Confirm 1 : 00 p.m. your location . Over . One hour post meridiem confirmed . What a beautiful day . Over . Buenos Aires and Shanghai , perfect antipodes , give or take 100 miles or so . There 's a slight deviation , because the Earth 's not a perfect sphere . - Are you getting all this ? - Oh yes . Every word . If that runs right through the center of the Earth , - why isn 't this thing a volcano ? - Again , no idea . Isn 't that wonderful ? The laws of The Blessing are beyond us . That 's why it took us so long to work out what it can do . How did you even find it ? Well , we had to wait until the world grew up , until the information age became fast enough so we could crunch the numbers on a massive scale . Facts became visible that were never visible before , such as a tiny little statistic hidden in the heart of Shanghai Old Town . The average life expectancy of those living within a two-mile radius of this point was exactly equal to the average life expectancy of the world , and it always had been . Say in 1998 , the average life expectancy from birth on this planet was 66 years , five months and 33 days . In this area in Shanghai , it was 66 years , five months and 33 days exactly . Try going back 100 years to 1898 . The average life expectancy was 49 years , nine months and five days . Shanghai- - 49 years , nine months , five days . It was as if something on this spot was calibrating a matrix , subsisting alongside humankind in harmony . But the Chinese didn 't know about it ? We paid them to look the other way . It does make you seem kind of colonial . Well , is that such a bad word ? Besides , we changed the whole of the world , and this is just phase one . Mr. Shapiro , sir . This is Sandra Lopez . She 's handling translation . He said , " Good morning , sir . " Listen , Rex , confirming your request for armed support- - your liaison is going to be Captain Federico Santos . Now he 's gonna need strict ratification . The Argentinean army is not allowed by law to get involved in civil conflicts on their own soil . Yeah , well , these are the three families , sir . You can classify it as a North American incursion . Oh , and by the way , Esther needs help . She 's with me . If you mean Esther Drummond , can I just point out she 's officially on the run from the C.I.A. ? I knew it . - She 'd follow him anywhere . - Miss Drummond , remind me to arrest you when this is all over . Yes sir . Now I need a check on all properties , residences and businesses falling in the path of this line . But that 's one of the densest populations on Earth . With a backwards economy , half that information won 't even be recorded . Excuse me , but foreign investment 's still rare in Argentina , so we 've been tracking contract-intensive money since 1980 . The information 's on file just waiting to be filtered . Excellent . Good call . Thank you . Hey , it might be a good time to start that trace . What , in the middle of all this ? It 's not tested . I mean it could bring down the whole system . I want that line pass through every single intel division . Hey , so what 's the trace ? Uh , it 's new software from the D.I.A. So the three families , they use that vine technology to piggyback their calls on 50,000 different lines . But the trace runs backwards , so it detects vine activity and then follows it back to the source . If there 's a mole working in this department , it means we can find him . Excellent . Good news . Yeah , I know . I 'm sorry . I am sorry . I 've just gotta keep going 15 ° North and your shop is in the way , so tough , really . I need to get out . Can I get out ? Wh- - if you open it , you get rid of me , okay ? So door , gone , me bye-bye . - No door . - No door ? Why no door ? Bad place . Many ghost . Listen , if you open that door , I will give you all the money in the world . Yeah ? Very bad , yes ? Very very bad . I think I found it . Oswald , we 're moving . Esther , this is Captain Santos , Fourth Maneuver Unit , Second Brigade . I think they found it . There 's been no paperwork around this site since 2001 . Access is via an alleyway running between South Pacheco Street and Rivadavia . - What 's the name of the alley ? - Well , that 's the point , sir . It 's not designated . It hasn 't got a name ... Just like the three families- - they wiped it off the map . All right , that 's it . Rex , prepare to mobilize . Anything you don 't need , leave behind . We 're coming back though , isn 't that right ? We 're coming back ? I don 't know . Are we ? So much for your death fetish when it all gets too real , huh ? Still , that victim of yours- - Susie Cabina- - how much choice did she have ? Who are you ? Captain Jack Harkness . No . I spent a long time in prison , and I know the smile of a man who 's done terrible things . And your friends- - I 've been watching them . Sometimes they like you , sometimes they love you and sometimes- - just once or twice , glittering away in those tiny little gaps- - they fear you . I 'm from the future . Well now . I come from the future . Then you must know . Do we make it through this day ? The future can change . It 's being written right now . But one thing I do know- - I 've seen the stars . I have seen the Universe . I have seen the human race become vast , magnificent and endless . And I wish you could see it , Oswald . I wish you could see that too . 'Cause then you 'd know how small you 've made your life . It 's me . Still alive . You 'd better be or there 'll be trouble . Anwen says hello . No , she doesn 't . She 's tiny . She hasn 't got a clue . All right , okay . Sorry . Ready ? Yeah , we can get into the camp . Andy 's worked it out . He 's here now . He 's got me this police visa . - That should get me in . - Torchwood calls and here I am . Tell him thanks . - She says thanks . - She 'll be the death of me . The trouble is there 's only the one visa , so we can 't get your mom in . I wouldn 't go , not to that godforsaken place . Andy 's checked the list and your dad , he 's still there , Category 1 . He 's in one of the wards . They haven 't sent him- - They haven 't sent him off yet . Is there anything you want me to say to him , Gwen ? I mean- - I feel like I 'm killing him . 'Cause if this goes right , the miracle ends . My father dies . Well , you know what ? Let him die . I mean , bless the poor bugger . I mean he 's had his time . You just come back alive . You got that ? She 'd better . Tell her for me . Yeah , you come back or I will be furious . All right , will do . Gotta go . Sad girl . Yes , I am . - Crazy girl . - Yes , that 's me . Thank you . Cheers . And if that happens , the regrouping will go through me . We 'll have to ratify that with Washington . - I help you , yes ? Give it to me . - Thank you . We take care . American goods . - And that . - Thanks . Someone help me up ? - Are you all right ? - You okay ? What 's wrong ? - He was injured . - No no . No , it 's- - it 's nothing . It 's just an old war wound . It 's getting worse . No no no no ! We 're dead ! Don 't you get it ? We 're dead ! We were in that explosion ! Come on , let 's go inside . Let 's go . Get up ! Sir , we 've lost radio contact . - The link with the army just cut dead . - Can 't have . Get ahold of them . That 's an explosion . That 's special ops station 2 , sir . That 's Rex and Esther . - All my men . - Captain , snap out of it . On your feet . Now listen to me . I need you to go to that base , okay ? But I want you to tell them that we died . Understand that ? Now look , you can try to get another squad , but do not tell them that Esther and I are still running it , okay ? - What are you gonna do ? - They think that we 're already dead . So now 's the perfect time , and I 'm going in - on my own . - I 'm coming with you . Oh shit . Fine , yeah , whatever . Come here . But you 've only got handguns . There 's just two of you . You need more than that ! - Our special weapon went up in smoke . - We had the blood . The only mortal blood in the world and it 's on that truck . - It 's Gwen . - Don 't answer it . Everyone needs to think that we 're dead , okay ? Now come on , let 's go . Let 's move . Somebody betrayed us . They had information inside the Directorate . - All right , Miller , run that trace . - I 'd need clearance from the- - I don 't care about the protocols . I don 't care if it brings down the whole pissing system . Run the trace and find the bastard . Now let 's go ! Okay , if there 's a vine this should track it right down to the handset . - Any luck ? - Almost . I hope you catch that traitor . Oh , hey , Sandra . I think Mr. Shapiro wanted to see you . Okay . Thanks . - You wanted to see me , sir ? - No . What for ? I don 't know . That analyst said- - I 'm sorry , what 's her name ? Charlotte ? Oh fuck . What was that ? Was that a bomb ? Ah ! - Okay , what have we got ? - The sublink 's just said there 's been an explosion in Buenos Aires . Special ops- - it 's Esther and Rex . They 're dead ? What do you care ? Why don 't you just shut it ? ! Okay . Oh ! Look , I 'm sorry , - but we can 't do this , not now . - This is about you , Jack . If the miracle is connected to your blood , then God help them , but they had the only reserve . The only blood we have now is in you . - Then I 'd better be careful . - But you could die this time . That 's the game . Yeah . - Let 's go . - Uh-huh . Okay . Come on . - How do we get down there ? - I 'm looking . I 'm looking . There 's gotta be stairs somewhere . You know , you could stay up here if you want . Oh , I was kinda hoping you wouldn 't say that . I got you in a whole lot of trouble , huh ? - I did that all on my own . - I never did thank you , did I ? No , you didn 't . Yeah , well , don 't expect it now . There- - stairs . West block hallway . Right here . Over here . There 's gonna be guards all the way in . You can 't keep doing this . They 're gonna find us . Shut him up . Of all the bastards to bring on a mission- - You condemn me ? You Category 1 these men with your bare hands . Keep your voice down . He 's got a point . He 's got a point . We 're just like bandits . We 're just on the perimeter here , Jack . How the hell are we meant to get deep inside ? Damn . It 's Rhys . He 's found my dad . Hey . It 's me , the useless article . I brought you a message . Gwen sends her love . Mary sends her love . We all do . All of us . He 's the lucky one . See that girl over there ? She was brought in as Category 1 . She must be 15 , 16 . No one 's tried to claim her . We don 't even know her name . Anyway , you 've got till the end of the shift and then we 're moving this lot . - They 're going to the furnace . - No , I- - I want to spend more time with him , please . - Make the most of it then . - Can 't we delay the transport ? We 've got this place running like clockwork now . You 've got 10 minutes , then they 're gone . But they 're still alive . And you 're gonna burn them ? Yeah , all clear . Wait a minute . I was in China for the Boxer Rebellion , and I know what that lettering means . Oswald , I 've changed my mind . I 'm so glad you 're here . - I knew it . - What 's happening ? You 're about to meet the creator . It 's that soldier . Hmph . He 's with Oswald ? Captain Jack Harkness . At last . No no no no , this isn 't about Jack . No , ma 'am . Excuse me , but it 's not at all . My name is Oswald Danes . Well . Hmm . Good evening , Miss Kitzinger . You 've been promoted . And this is the new empire you 're servicing ? My my my my my my my . With all due respect , Mr. Danes , you 're a by-product of the miracle . You 're not really relevant at all . That 's what the Captain said . He tried to tell me that my life has become a very small thing . Tiny . And yet right here , right now at the very end I would describe myself differently . I would call myself vital . Madam , you 're a fine woman . You should be careful now , very careful indeed . It seems like you 've been planning some kind of an explosion , but I 'd love to make sure you 're still inside . Advantage Torchwood . Well , I 'm afraid we have a major disagreement here in Buenos Aires . I 'd say advantage families . Say hello to your friends . What 's that supposed to mean ? - He means us . - Rex ? Oh my God . And Esther ? I 'm here . They caught us . Just glad to hear you 're alive . I 'll swap your standoff for my standoff . Don 't you do it . But nobody dies . She 'll keep on living , - just perforated . - Threaten me , you coward , - not her . - Rex . Hey , I 'm okay . If you hurt her , we 've got explosives here ready to go . And don 't imagine I won 't ! Whatever happens here tonight , there 's no place on Earth that I can go , and I wasn 't planning on coming out of here alive ! So who 's gonna lose their nerve first ? The thing is , we don 't need explosives , guns or threats , 'cause I 've got the most powerful thing of all . It wants me- - mortal blood . The only one in the whole world . So I suggest you 're very careful with me , okay ? And if you fail to take the Captain 's advice , you can certainly come to oblivion with me . Jack , you 're the future man . You 've seen wonders beyond this world , so tell us of these blessings and miracles . What the hell is that thing ? - Can you feel it ? - Yeah , I can feel it . Oh yeah . God , I can- - okay . God . Oh my God . It is said that it reflects your ownself back at you . - What can you see ? - Enough guilt to last me a lifetime . But that 's okay , I 'm a working mother . I don 't need The Blessing to tell me that . And you , Jack ? I 've lived so many lives and now I can see them all . Hey . Not so bad . Well , you might wanna question your choice of weapon , soldier . Let 's see . You brought the world 's biggest bastard , wired him up to a bomb and then showed him his soul . Hmm , that 's good work . You know , I feel really safe right now . Oswald . Oswald . - Don 't lose it . - Sin . The Blessing feels like sin . Oswald , don 't . I need you . I guess I 'm accustomed to sin . Thank you . I still don 't get it . What are we looking at ? The Blessing- - is it the rock or is it the edge ? What ? It 's the gap in-between , the nothingness . The space . It 's alive . It 's like they broke the world . You 're the expert . What is it ? The world 's been turning for over four billion years . There 's so much buried under its skin . The doctor used to say there 's a Silurian mythology , Huon particles , Racnoss energy , an expansion of their hibernation matrix , - maybe- - - You don 't bloody know , do you ? - No . - No . It 's been here since the Earth began ? - Could be . - Yeah . Oh , it has . I can feel it . We 're so used to these things being extraterrestrial , but this might be the most terrestrial thing of them all . Wow . So you found The Blessing and you worked out this morphic field . The Blessing exists in a symbiotic relationship with the human race . It transmits a morphic field around the planet , binding us together like magnetism , like sunlight . But finding it wasn 't enough . You had to experiment on it . No , we fed it . We fed it the blood of an immortal . We had one remarkable artifact . We found a second remarkable artifact . The combination was inevitable . So The Blessing absorbed the blood , copied it like a new template . So the system changed its setting . You know why it did that ? I think you hurt it . It was being attacked , so it took the blood pattern and made it a gift . It 's exerting itself to sustain every person on the planet . This whole miracle- - it 's trying to be kind . You 've seen immortality . I 'm living it . Why would you want this ? This is only stage one . But you ruined the world out there ! The miracle shocked the economy . The economy collapsed . We tear down in order to rebuild . And now it 's almost within sight- - the new world . Yeah , with no room for the poor , the weak or the ones that don 't fit in . That 's the way the world works now . We 're just making it official . The families have just been waiting . Now we can step in to control the banks . The banks control government . The government controls people . Soon we 'll be able to decide who lives , how long , where and why . - It 's about time ! - Oh great , so it 's the world according to Kitzinger , is it ? Listen , you can bleed your liberal heart all over the place , but are you really gonna tell me the world was working before ? 'Cause I have worked for the rich , the powerful and the obese . I have stared into the high end of western society and let me tell you , it is like shoveling an open sewer . These families- - they want to make the world fitter , more compact , more disciplined . And I like the sound of that . That sounds like salvation . But before you launched this brave new world , you had to deal with one more thing . Yeah- - me . So as soon as the miracle happened , you sent the Torchwood email . His blood endangers the plan . We had to draw him out into the open . Well , you failed . I got to Shanghai . I 've got the only mortal blood on the planet . If it gets into The Blessing , life switches back . I can make the whole world mortal . - No . - Oh no . - Sadly not . - He 's not listening . - He doesn 't seem to get it . - No no no . - Polar dynamics , Jack . - Everything on this axis operates in a polar-dynamic field . You could reset The Blessing , your blood could make the whole world mortal again , but only by introducing it to both cities at once . - Blood in Buenos Aires ... - Blood in Shanghai ... Entering The Blessing simultaneously . That 's how we fed it . That 's how we made the world immortal . And for you- - I 'm sorry , it 's impossible . You did very well , almost worked it out , but all that spare blood of yours went up in flames . - Nice try . - So we 're just gonna have to kill you . Whoa whoa whoa whoa ! Jack , I know how your mind works . Even now you 're ferociously calculating how you can get your blood to the other side of the world . But I can 't allow that . Absolutely not . Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh . - I 'm warning you- - I 'll do it . - Then I 'll die , and that 's a shame , 'cause you can blast his blood into that wall and it won 't make any difference at all . I 'll do it ! I 'll do it ! Wait a minute . If you need the blood of Jack Harkness on the other side of the world , then ju- - I 'll do it ! Just listen to me ! Jack ! All right . I 'm all right . As I was saying , if you need Jack 's blood , how about this ? What was that ? What happened ? - Rex , what did you do ? - That 's impossible . No way . There 's nothing special about you . Oh , but there is , when I 've got Jack 's blood flowing through my veins . It 's inside me . - What ? - Oh my God . See , we knew this blood was important , - so as soon as we arrived ... - We transfused it into Rex . We exchanged his blood for Jack 's . Okay okay . On most days it might 've killed me . But we 're all living on Miracle Day . And everyone thought the blood was gone , so no one even suspected . All we did was keep one final bag , filled the rest with Rex 's blood - and Jack 's mortal blood ... - Just walked right in . Hey , Oswald , you wanna be a walking bomb ? - Get him out of there ! - Well , try this- - shoot me ! Shoot me ! Come on ! Shoot me ! - Don 't ! Don 't ! Don 't ! - Pull that trigger ! Splatter my blood ! - Shoot me ! - Get him out ! - Get him out ! - One more move ! Huh ? Wow , Rex , you 're a genius ! You just shut the hell up . All right ? This shit hurts . Yeah , we 've got blood on both sides of the world , Jack , but- - But they will die . Is that what you want ? The Blessing will take every last drop . You 'll both die , gentlemen . You 'll both kill yourselves . You will die in a pit in Shanghai . - Is that what you want ? - I think I 've lived long enough . You ready , Rex ? Oh , you know I wish I 'd never met you , You World War II idiot . Good times , huh ? Yeah . I 'll see ya . - Just one last thing , Jack . - What is it ? You 're never gonna be a suicide . Thank you . - Bye then . - Bye . Face front . This is it , Rex . - Nothing 's gonna stop me . - I think this might . No ! No ! No ! - What was that ? ! - Rex , what was that ? You bastard ! You son of a bitch ! Esther , come here . Oh God . These are the days of the miracle , Mr. Matheson . She can 't die , and we have infinite resources . We can help her . We can make her better . If the miracle ends , she dies . Is that what you want ? All of you with your fine and noble deaths , do you really want to bring about hers ? Jack , what do I do ? - I don 't know . - Oh God , what do I do ? What do I do ? I 'll tell you what you do , Rex- - you carry on . Keep going . Back to the plan . We 'll kill her . - I know . - This is Esther we 're talking about . Yes , I know it 's Esther , and it 's my dad and it 's everyone who 's ever gonna die . But , Rex , we 've got to do this and I 'm gonna tell you why . Because I 'm standing here and I 'm staring at Oswald Danes . He chose when that girl lived and he chose when that girl died . And no one should have that power . Not the rich , not the mad , - not anyone . - You 're choosing now . - Yeah , you watch me . - You 'll kill Jack , Rex and that girl Esther- - all of that Torchwood team ? You 'd kill them all ? Yeah . Oh , you are magnificent . Ready ? Rex ! I 'm sorry . - Yeah . - I 'm so sorry . Don 't do it ! Don 't ! - Don 't do it ! - You 'll kill her ! And that 's what I did . In a pit in old Shanghai I brought death back to the world . They said it was like a breath- - the breath that went around the whole wide world . The last breath . And then no more . We said goodbye to them then- - the dads and the moms , the sick and the old , the friends and the neighbors And the people we once met and the people whose names we never knew . We said goodbye to them all on the day that death came back . Jesus Christ almighty ! No ! No . Ah ! No ! Missy , I 'm giving you this one chance . I 'll give you estates ! I 'll give you places to hunt ! Hold that lift ! Hey ! Guess what- - - Death came back . - No ! Ah . He changed back ! He 's immortal again ! Wait ! At last ! A miracle ! How much bloody lipstick can you wear ? Better run , Torchwood ! I 'm taking this thing with me ! - The whole thing ! - Please ! For God 's sake , help me ! Help me ! Soon ! Oh , soon I 'll see her ! You won 't see anybody ! You 're going to hell , Danes ! But that 's where they go ! All the bad little girls , they run straight to hell and I 'm following ! Come on ! Susie , keep running ! I 'm coming to get you ! Run faster ! Faster ! Jilly ! Get ' em out ! Get ' em out ! Get them out !

I had to buy my way out of that godforsaken country . I had to sell my own jewelry ! I can 't go home . I 've got the C.I.A watching out for me , the F.B.I.- - Everyone . What do I do now ? You start again . - With who ? - Us . Why would I do that after everything you have put me through ? Because we very nearly succeeded . As trial runs go , it was good . Trial runs for what ? Plan B. Interested ? I 'm sorry , Rex . She was more than a colleague . I 'd like to think she was a friend . Thanks . Appreciate it . Lucky she got a full service . There 's 10 funerals every hour these days- - catching up with the backlog . Well , that 's made us all feel better . You think if that blessing was so kind , it could 've shown some sort of grace . Esther died right in front of it . That morphic field could 've reached out and saved one last life . - Why not ? - We 'll never know . UNITS sealed those sites up forever . Let that thing stay buried . What about you two , this Torchwood team ? You reunited or what ? Say no , please . Dunno . You staying ? - You want me to stay ? - Please say no . Oh boy . Whoa whoa whoa . Anything wrong ? It 's about Noah- - you know , the analyst who died with Shapiro ? They just retrieved his software from the explosion . The good thing is he told me his password because it 's the same place I used to go for donuts . His last job was to look for that leak . - What is it ? What 's it say ? - Shit . Charlotte ! Charlotte ! Charlotte ! Get help ! Clear the area ! - There might be more ! - Oh no ! Oh come on . No no , not after everything he 's gone through . No ! There 's nothing we can do . I 'm- - I 'm sorry , Gwen . I am so sorry . He 's dead . - What ? - What ? What ? - What ? - What the hell ? That 's impossible .

 - What do you think ? - I don 't know yet . It 's so hard to tell . Well , here , look at this one . It 's her eyes , Andrea . Look at those eyes . The mouth , see that ? I saw her yesterday when I took the photograph . This time I 'm positive , I know it 's her . You sure her name is Janie ? Yeah , I 'm sure . Here , here . Janie Bennett , the age is right . It all figures . It 's got to be her . - Where does she live ? - Dover . About five miles from here . I thought you 'd forgotten about me , Jude . I told you , I 'd call you as soon as I found something , didn 't I ? Jude , what if it 's not her ? What if it 's like all the other times ? What if we come out with nothing ? What then ? We 'll wait . And we keep on waiting until we find her . Evidence of telepathy appears most readily when the unconscious mind is most receptive . And it 's most receptive in the dream state . We can tell when the subject is dreaming through alpha brainwave activity . Heart rate , breathing patterns , ah , R.E.M. - Ah , Bennett . - Oh , Dean Fuller , how are you , sir ? - Fine , how are you ? - Fine . I 'd like you to meet Dr Jeena Kingsly . - Dr Kingsly , this is Professor Bennett . - How do you do ? Pleased to meet you . Dr Fuller has told me quite a bit about your astro-physics programme . Sounds fascinating . Dr Kingsly just arrived from London last week . She is to help us set up our new physics division . - What division is that ? - Para-physics . These subjects have already woken and they 're trying to sketch the dominant figure in their dreams . Thank you , Margaret . - May I ? - Of course . So what you 're saying is that these dreams are inspired by some sort of telepathic communication . - I can see you 're a sceptic , Dr Bennett . - Sceptic ? I think you 'll find our work very closely related . Trying to understand the phenomena of the real world sometimes reveals more the nature of the mind than the nature of things . Wouldn 't you agree ? Our concern at this point is the gathering of facts . The theory part comes later . Janie . Janie . Hi , Mommy . - Who was that ? - I don 't know , some lady . What did she say to you ? Mommy , can we go to the fair again ? Daddy 's home . Hi , Daddy . Hi , sweetheart . How 's my favourite star tonight ? Fine . Do you love me , Daddy ? Of course , I love you , sweetheart . - Can I carry your briefcase ? - No , it 's too heavy , sweetheart . - Then can I carry the bottle ? - Sure , take it in the kitchen , OK ? - OK . - Hey , don 't run with the bottle , Janie . - Oh , I 'm full of paint . - How was your day today ? It was all right . What 's the matter ? Oh , that . What do you think ? - Strange . - Very funny . Can you take me and Mommy to the carnival on Saturday ? - Didn 't you go with her yesterday ? - Yes , but I want to go again . You were right . We were lucky . I mean , it could have took years to find her . It did take years . Five stinking years in that rotten pit . It wasn 't all that bad . We never would have met otherwise . Hey , let 's you and me celebrate , huh ? That 's a great idea . I 've got some whiskey in the back . I 'll go get it . No , no , no , no , wine . Wine . I bet the liquor store is still open . I 'll meet you up in my room , OK ? OK . Coming . Coming . Oh , hold your horses . Oh , it 's you . That was quick . I figure we can get a couple of hundred dollars for the trailer . It ain 't much ... Leave it behind . There 's no time to sell that thing . Cheers . There 's a house in Clinton County I 've been looking at . I mean , it 's nothing . Nothing fancy , but it 's cheap , real cheap . And , I know the owner , he 's a nice sort of guy . It 'd be a good place to settle down . It 'd be good for the kid . Good for Janie . Settling down ? What are you talking about settling down for ? Sometimes I don 't understand you , Jude . Settling down for what ? This comes first . No , no , listen , listen , Andrea . Andrea , this house ... We can hide out in it for a while until things blow over . It 's way out in the middle of nowhere . There are no roads , no towns , nothing , just woods . Nobody has lived there for years . They 'll never find us . - Miles ? - Mm ? There was a strange woman watching Janie today . Miles , in the school yard today , there was a woman I 've never seen before looking at Janie . Ah , well ... What was Janie doing ? It doesn 't matter what Janie was doing . Did this woman say anything to her ? I heard her call Janie 's name . What you 're really saying is that consciousness is more primordial - than matter . - Are you ready to accept that ? You mean am I ready to view reality as an arbitrary consensus ? Yes . No . Then how do you account for telepathy or precognition or retrocognition ? I 'm not so sure that I do . That 's because the fundamental principles upon which your science is based on are incomplete . - Would it help if I closed my eyes ? - You might find you 'll see a lot better . Tell me Dr Kingsly , will this new age of enlightenment pass me by ? Perhaps not . I 'm leading a seminar in about 15 minutes . - Why don 't you drop in ? - Wonderful . You won 't mind ? Why should I mind ? But you must promise me one thing , Dr Bennett . Miles . - Miles . - What 's that ? That you come with the open minded spirit of true and free scientific inquiry . - Leave behind my prejudices . - And fears . - Fears . - Promise ? Promise . Hi , Sheri . Hi , Lenore . How 'd it go this morning ? Well , my lawyer said it went all right , but you know Barry . I could never get ... Ah , do you mind if , if we didn 't go to lunch today ? - Anything the matter , Sheri ? - What do you mean ? You , you just seem down all of a sudden . Oh , no , I 'm just a little tired . Ah , Janie had bad dreams last night . What were they about ? She said she didn 't remember , but whatever they were , they terrified her . And so the fundamental assumption of modern science is that we are separate entities and everything is external to us . This approach , however , obscures our true nature . Parapsychology becomes a rather philosophic and theological science at this point . What is the cause of such an illusion ? It arises from the structure of our nervous system and the false way we are trained as children to perceive . The clairvoyant reality is totally rejected by science and finds expression only in , art , music , religion . Hi , Mommy . - Oh , hello , darling . - Hi . Hello . Oh , hello , Miles . No , I 'm all right . What 's up ? Oh , oh , I see . No , no , that 's OK . No , really , it 's all right . Maybe I 'll have Lenore come over tonight . OK . I love you , too . It was all so strange . I 'm not even sure how I got to the school to pick Janie up . Do you suppose it had anything to do with Janie 's nightmare . Maybe . I never thought of that . You know , I once read about two miners who were trapped in a mine for two weeks and they began to share the same hallucinations . - You and Janie maybe ... - Come on , Lenore . - Who knows ? Maybe . - Mommy . Janie ! - What are you doing up ? - I can 't sleep . - Well , you have to try . - When 's Daddy coming home ? Daddy will be home soon . He 's having dinner with another professor . Now , I want you to go back upstairs . It 's past your bedtime . No ! She is mine . And , she 'll always be mine . It 's all right , Mommy 's here . It 's all right , baby . Where the hell is the kid ? 'Operator . ' Yes , could you get me the police ? - Is this an emergency ? - Get me the police . Hey , this is my house . I live here . Honey . Miles . Oh , it was so awful . - I , I don 't know how she ... - What ? - What happened ? - I don 't know how ... - Sheri , what happened ? - She ... - Is Janie all right ? - Janie 's in the bedroom . What happened ? We got a call about an attempted kidnapping . Kidnapping ! Is my daughter all right ? She 's upstairs asleep . I trusted you . You told me there 'd be no problem . What the ... are we going to do with a goddamn doll ? No ! No ! - Hi , Lieutenant . - Where is everybody ? Upstairs . Doctor got here about five minutes ago . Father here yet ? He 's standing right behind you , sir . She 's asleep . Mr Bennett , Mark Denver , detective , county police . Mind if I ask you a few questions ? No , not at all . Now , where were you at the time of the break in ? I was having dinner with a colleague . I got here after the cops came . Could you imagine why anyone would want to kidnap your daughter ? Kidnap . ' ... kidnapping attempt earlier this evening . 'Dover police are now searching the area 'for one or possibly more unidentified persons . 'One , a young woman wearing a red dress . 'She allegedly entered the home of Dover College Professor Miles Bennett 'on Crestview Drive and made her way into the bedroom of his daughter . ♪ Yellow , yellow daffodils ♪ You 're dancing in the sun ♪ Oh , yellow , yellow daffodils ♪ You tell me spring has come ♪ You are such a pretty baby . Yes , you are . Oh , yes , you are , aren 't you ? Your mommy loves you . Yes , she does . You 're her favourite little girl in the whole world . What are you doing ? Leave us alone . Goddamn it , let go . No . Oh , my God , my baby ! My baby . What did you do to my baby ? Your baby ? Your baby 's back in the goddamn house with its mother . What 's it to you ? You 're not her father . You are nobody 's father . And , you 're never going to be anyone 's father . You aren 't even a goddamn man . - Quiet ? - Like a church . Well , it didn 't mean much to me at the time , but my wife said she saw some woman , a stranger , talking to Janie in the school yard . Oh , when was that ? I think it was Monday . You know , Sheri 's very concerned . She always has been about Janie . She 's lost ... we 've lost two children in childbirth . I see . That 's all . Except , except this thing . This thing that happened last night . Do you think that might be the same woman ? I don 't know . You see ... we 're not Janie 's natural parents . Sheri and I adopted Janie five years ago . 'Parapsychology lab . ' Yes , Dr Jeena Kingsly , please . Oh , she is . Well , can I leave a message ? This is Professor Bennett . That 's right , that 's right . And I 'll call her later . Thank you very much . 'Come here , Miles . ' Miles . Sheri , are you all right ? Honey , what are you doing out of bed ? Ah , I just got a little chill that 's all . Honey ... just before in the bathroom while I was brushing my hair , the mirror began to ... What about the mirror ? It frosted up , Miles . Became foggy . I think Janie 's mother is putting a hex on us . Sheri , between what happened last night and the pills that Dr Page gave you , I think you just ... Miles , how do you explain the mirror ? I can 't . Not right now . But , there is ... There 's a plausible explanation for everything , right ? - Todd Fletcher ? - That 's right . Mark Denver , detective , county police . That 's a new one . Come on in . Recuperating from something ? Ah , on the job injury . The spinal column . My legs are paralysed . Attractive little place you have here . You live alone ? My girlfriend lives with me . Not your ex-wife by any chance ? Ah , Andrea ? No . I haven 't heard from her since the divorce . - Five years ago . - About that , yeah . Ever talk to her ? Not even hello . Why ? Is she in trouble ? - Missing . - Missing . She 's been missing since the day I met her . She was released from the state mental hospital six months ago . This was her last known address . After I had my accident ... she felt tied down , imprisoned . I was willing to give her a divorce . She refused at first , but ... Well , one day I came home from vocational training and she was gone . She , she left and took Janie . The , only thing she left behind was this trunk . - What 's in it ? - Music . Her music . Tons of it . She never sent for it either . I , I heard that , er , she 'd started going out again . She 'd leave Janie at home for days at a time . I wanted to take care of her , but , but I couldn 't . Not like this . Did you have her put away ? No , I , I didn 't have to . She was found one week later on a stage during a concert in New Orleans . Stark naked and half out of her mind . Mm . Well , Mr Fletcher , I get the picture . Sorry to discommode you . Ah , not at all , Mr Denver . - Hey . - Mm ? - You know , I , I did hear from her . - Oh ? Just after she got out . A letter . She needed money and naturally she came to me first . - Did you send it to her ? - Ah , are you kidding ? I couldn 't afford the price of a postage stamp . Did she tell you where to send it ? Some address in Roxbury . You can keep it if you want . I 'm surprised I didn 't throw it out . It 's impossible , Jeena . It 's impossible only if you consider physical agents , Miles . Then how do you account for it ? According to the present laws of physical science , I couldn 't . I would either have to deny it happened or I would ignore it . She says it did happen . Yes , and other equally inexplicable events may occur as well . Between the kidnapping attempt and the vulnerability Sheri must feel , not being the natural mother of Janie . - What do you come up with ? - A mess , I tell you . No ! Miss Fletcher . Miss Fletcher ! - Do you hear something ? - Sounds like voices . Miss Fletcher are you there ? Has she had any visitors here lately ? One man and that 's all . Would you recognise him if you saw him again ? I would recognise him even if I was blindfolded . What 's the matter ? Something happened in Janie 's room while you were gone . Oh ? The light . The daylight from the window went . It went dark all around me . But , the window stayed the same . But , the rest of the room ... I wasn 't going to tell you . Let 's have a look . Miles . That 's not all . I saw that , that woman again . In Janie 's room ? She was sitting on Janie 's bed . She was covered with blood . Miles , she looked like death . Turn on the light . Oh , I love the way you touch me . Oh , I love touching you . Oh , I can almost ... Oh , let it ring , honey . Miles , please . Hello . 'Sheri , this is Andrea . ' Who ? 'You know , Janie 's mother . ' I 'm Janie 's mother . 'Janie 's real mother . 'You 've got my baby , Sheri . ' We don 't have your baby , she 's ours and you can 't have her . I won 't let ... I won 't let you ... Sheri , give me the phone . 'There 's nothing you can do . I 'm coming for my baby . ' Hello . Hello ... ? I hear nothing . Miles ... - Miles . - I heard nothing , Sheri . Sheri , there 's someone I want you to meet . Someone who just might be able to ... I don 't know exactly , but I ... I 'm not interested in hearing what you or anybody else you know has to say about anything . This person 's working in a field which might just shed some light on what 's going on around here . What is he ? A psychiatrist ? It 's a she . She 's a parapsychologist . She just arrived this week and I talked to her about your visions . She said they just might possibly be something . Might ? Miles , of course , there 's something . Will you talk to her ? Please , Sheri . Will you please talk to her ? All right . Mommy , is there a turtle heaven ? There 's a heaven for each of us , Janie . Even for Spot ? Even for Spot . Hello ? Oh , Miles , thank God . I was waiting for your ... Right now ? As soon you Janie and you can get over here . Hold on , I 'll find out . Jeena , ah , how long will this take ? It , it 's hard to say . Mm-hm , good . All right , we 'll meet at my office in the physics building . Feel cold , sweetie ? Huh ? Give me my coat , sweetie . Oh , my God , no . Mommy , what 's that funny stuff on the window ? I don 't know , sweetheart . Get down , Janie . Get down ! Mommy . Mommy . Get down , Janie . Get down on the floor , honey . Get down on the floor . Mommy . Ah , where 's Janie ? Janie ! Janie ! May I talk to her ? Be best to let her sleep for just a bit . 'Dr Adler , Dr Adler , 163 . ' Is my daughter all right ? Who ? Janie , our daughter . She was in the car with Sheri . Mrs Bennett was the only one brought into the hospital , sir . What ? Are you sure ? You can check with Dr Larabee . - I want to see Dr Larabee . - Would you spell the last name ? - For Christ sake . - He 's right over there , sir . - Dr Larabee . - Yes ? My wife , Sheri Bennett , was brought into the hospital today . That 's Room C down the corridor . I just came from there . The nurse told me she was the only one brought in . - That 's right . - My daughter was in the car with her . Your daughter ? There wasn 't anyone else in the car . Dr Larabee , she was there . She was with my wife in the car . She was there with my wife in the car . Hello . Hello ? 'You are such a pretty baby . Yes , you are , aren 't you ? - Who is this ? - ' Mommy loves you . Yes , she does . ' Just tell me who this is . You 're her favourite little girl in all the world . Hello . Hello ? Sorry about that , Mrs Bennett . We thought it best to let you sleep . We unplugged your extension . I 'll hook it back if you like . Your husband 's outside . Would you like to see him ? How are you feeling ? Janie 's gone , isn 't she ? She took her . Police are searching the area . But , they 're going to find her . It was Andrea . She put a hex on the car . The nurse said they 'd probably let you come home tomorrow . She planned for it to crash . She was waiting there to take Janie . Sheri , please . Andrea 's kidnapped her . She 's got her now . Nobody 's ever going to find her . Andrea 's got special powers . Honey , why don 't you get some sleep ? We 'll never see Janie again . Miles , turn the car around . Why ? What 's the matter ? Please , we 're going the wrong way . Sheri , we 'll be home in five minutes . Please turn the car around . Go to the right . We must call a doctor . I want no one to know about her . Do you understand ? - But , the girl is not well . - I 'll take care of her . - She needs a doctor . - Don 't tell me what she needs ! Yeah , yeah , just a minute . Yeah , what can I do for you ? Mark Denver , county police . I 'm looking for a young girl about six years old . Missing since last night . Maybe you 've seen her . - No , sorry . - Take a good look . - You say she disappeared last night . - That 's right . Try the guy over in the carousel . A lot of kids come through there . I 'll do that . Honey , you know where we 're going ? Here , turn off here . We 're almost here . Almost where ? Drive onto that driveway . Sheri . She 's here . I know she 's here . - Who 's here ? - I can feel it . - Janie ? - I don 't know . Let 's get out of here . This place belongs to somebody . We can 't come in here and look in this lake like this . Come on . There 's death in this lake . Oh , my God , no . Mrs Bennett , they just recovered a body . It 's not your daughter . Would you like to go home ? This leaves you little choice , Miles . She knew exactly where she was going . By the way , Professor , I 'd like you to take a look at this . - Where 'd you get this ? - At the boarding house in Roxbury where Andrea Fletcher used to stay . Do you have any idea who took this picture ? No , no idea . Ah , I figured as much . It 's too bad . Well , the coroner will want me to be signing the papers . - You 'll be available this afternoon ? - Mm-hm . Let 's hope we have some news by then . A pleasure to meet you , ma 'am . She 's calmed down now . Maybe she 'll sleep . I wish to hell this thing would end , Jeena . Miles ... there 's not much time . We must now deal completely within the metaphysical system . Sheri , whenever you 're ready , I would like you to lift the veil from the portrait . Hello . Yes , he is . It 's for you . Dr Bennett . Ah , Jesus , I 'm sorry . I forgot all about it . I , I know . Look , I 'll be right there . OK . I 'm er ... Sorry I 'm late . Ah , our discussion today involves the black holes of the universe , the collapse of stars of such density that matter , anti-matter and light cannot escape it 's gravity . The idea that space has structure may sound strange since we usually think of space as a kind of nothingness ... Born of clouds of dust and gases , stars lead relatively uneventful lives , pouring out energy . And then they die . Allow the painting to caress you . Two energies flow through you . Don 't use your will . Surrender it . Oh , my God , no . No . No . No . I got something for you . You hold this for me , OK ? I got something for you . Ah , what a wonderful , beautiful thing I got for you . Wait . Yes , yes , yes , do I have something for you . Ah , oh , yes . Dah-dah ! Dah-dum . Dah-dah-dah-dah-dum . She 's alive . I saw her . Tell me exactly what you saw . 'My feeling is that Janie is still alive . ' This music means something . I know it does . Mind if I use your phone , Professor ? Of course . - Inspector . - Hm ? Are there any stables in this area ? A couple of dozen and some horse farms , too . I think wherever we find Janie , there will be horses . Whatever you say . - Lieutenant , I found it . - Here , let 's check it . That 's it ! 'Operator . May I help you ? ' 'This is the operator , may I help you ? ' 'May I help you ? ' That wasn 't the Star Spangled Banner your wife was humming this afternoon . It was this . The last music Andrea Fletcher wrote before she got locked up . And , before she was killed . - The body in the lake . - That 's right . And the coroner 's report sets her death in no less than 48 hours before your daughter 's disappearance . With the Fletcher girl dead , we lose our prime suspect . And without a ransom note , nor any other evidence that this is a kidnapping , and without any motivation , well , I just can 't see myself bringing this to the FBI . Not at this point . Ordinarily , Professor , I just step back and turn it over to missing persons . But , I just can 't let myself do that . Something 's not adding up . There 's too many weird things going on . Like your wife bringing you to the lake . And this music . There 's a hidden key to all of this buried underneath . I want to be there when it 's found . We 're losing her . There 's so little time . I can feel Andrea 's anger . You must appease it then . Appease a dead woman 's anger ? The woman is dead , Inspector , but her anger still lives . Unless we turn it into love , anger never dies . All right , how do you propose we do that ? Andrea wanted two things . She 's got one now . Let 's give her the other and see what happens . Lieutenant , we are going to present a concert tonight . I 'm not sure I can remember how to play . It doesn 't matter . Do as best you can . Well , folks , is that it ? Can I send my men home ? - I think we 've just about had it . - No , I need them . She 's going to try again in a few minutes . Will you please let me know when you 're all done here . I 'll be back in a little while . I 'll be at your place in case you need me . Are you serious , Jeena ? I don 't think Sheri can handle any more of this . I think that 's up to Sheri to decide . - Mind if I join you ? - Not at all . - I take it the concert didn 't work . - Hm . You knew it wouldn 't , didn 't you ? Yeah , but the good Dr Kingsly just won 't back off . Look , look at what I just found in today 's mail . Look at that . I can 't believe she 's gone . Holy cats . - I 've got to stop this . - Let her play . No , she 's had enough . Could you tell me where I could find the man who took this picture ? That there is Jude , the clown , you want to see , mister . But , where is he ? Well , you won 't find him here . He ran off about ten minutes ago . 'Why don 't you take a ride over to 368 Seminary Avenue . ' The horses . Oh , my God , the horses . - I got to get in the trailer . - Lay off . I want to get in . Where is she ? Where is she ? Where is she ? Where is she ? !

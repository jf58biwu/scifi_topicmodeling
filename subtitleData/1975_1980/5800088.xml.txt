 Nanu-nanu . ( loud clank ) Shazbot ! ♪ ♪ Ow . Ow . Eer , ow , ooh . Ah , hah , hah . That 's enough . I 'll tell you what you want to know . I don 't believe you . Don 't you get haircuts on Ork ? No , we try to avoid them because of the noggachomps . " Noggachomps " ? What 's that ? It 's a small green creature about this big . We put them on our heads and let them graze . They 're vicious little animals . Kind of ( snarling ) . That sounds dangerous . Oh , only if you fall asleep in the chair . Occasionally a maverick will get loose from the herd and run down your neck . That 's why we have to set traps in our shorts . What a horrible system . Mindy , you don 't understand Orkan philosophy . If something works , don 't fix it . Well , there , you look much better . Ah . You 're all done . Ooh , ah , I feels worse , though . How much do I owe you ? Where did you get the money ? I baby-sat for Eugene . Here , six big ones . Well , you just keep the money . The haircut is on me . No , it 's on me . ( phone ringing ) Hello ? Hello . Brad . ( nasally ) : Hi , there . How are you ? Well , it 's so nice to hear from you again . Nice to hear from you , too . I thought you were in law school somewhere . I 'm out now ... Ow ! Well , congratulations . No big deal . Uh ... Here , go water yourself . Oh . Well , sure , that would be fine . I 'd love to have dinner . Sure . All right , 7 : 30 it is . Okay , great , I 'll see you then . Bye . Mork , I have a date . Don 't tell me ... June 2 , 1852 . No , I mean this guy that I really used to like is back in town and we 're going to have dinner tonight . Oh , good , where are we going ? " Where are we going ? " Oh , boy . Mork , you know I 've been thinking . You and I have ... I think we 've been seeing too much of each other lately . Well , then all you have to do is close one eye . No , I mean , I think you should get out and meet more people . You know , see more things . Oh , I get it . Two 's company , " we 's " a crowd . Oh , no . No , not that , necessarily . I mean , for your own development you really should get out and meet more people . Like who ? Are you ready to start the inventory , Cora ? Certainly , Fredzo . And don 't call me Fredzo . It sounds like a detergent . Yes . Now , let 's see , there are one , two , three , four , five , six Meat Loaf albums . Six Meat Loaf . Mm-hmm . One , two , three , four ... Nine Bread albums . Nine Bread . This isn 't an inventory . It 's a grocery list . Hi , Grandma . Oh . Oh , hello , darling . Daddy . How 's the nicest , sweetest , most wonderful father in the world ? Suspicious . Now you think I want something from you ? Is that how little you think of your own daughter ? Well , as a matter of fact , I have something for you . Two free tickets to tonight 's basketball game . You 're taking Mork . That 's the nicest thing you 've given me since the chicken pox . Fredzo , it 's only 11 : 00 . You 're not usually a wiener before noon . See , Dad , I need Mork out of the house tonight . I have a date . With a human ? That 's wonderful . Yeah , well , it won 't be wonderful if he comes to pick me up at my place and finds Mork there . That 's why you just have got to take him to that game . But Mindy , I detest basketball . Oh , but Dad , I haven 't had a date since Mork moved in . Every time the phone rings , I almost hope it 's heavy breathing . I didn 't hear that . Basketball . How can anybody sit through a game that has so much dribbling ? Well , if I can 't date other men I guess I 'll just have to settle down with Mork and have cute little green babies that drink their formula with their finger . Free throw ! One-on-one ! Jump shot ! Dunk shot ! I 'll go ! I 'll go ! MINDY : That was such a nice dinner , Brad . Here 's to the old times . Here 's to the new times . All right . Brad , can I ask you something kind of dumb ? Sure . How come you never asked me out when we were in high school ? Because I was a jerk . Yeah , you were . I wish I 'd kept in touch with you , Mindy . You 're a wonderful girl . Yeah , I am . Greetings ! Mork ! ( humming ) What are you doing here ? Dribbling . Oh , is this the guy you used to like ? Mork , this is Brad Jackson . Brad , this is my friend Mork . Hi . I 'm glad to meet you . Nanu-nanu . Certainly . So is " Mork " your first or last name ? Yes . Did you enjoy having food with Mindy ? Yes , I did . So do I. Everybody enjoys having food with Mindy . So , did the basketball game end early ? I guess so . After about an hour , your father stopped it . My father stopped it ? Yeah , he said , " This has gone on long enough . " Oh , Mork , what did you do ? Oh , lots of things . I had a great time . Ever been to a basketball game ? My favorite part was when I got to dance . You danced ? Oh , yeah , that part at the beginning , where they played the music , everyone stood up and ♪ Oh , say can you see ? ♪ He 's a great kidder . Then some man asked me to pass him his coffee , so I did . He didn 't catch it , though . That 's too bad . But your father caught it with his pants . Then it was his turn to dance . Then we went to a place called the rest room . I didn 't get any rest there , though . I had a terrible seat . Couldn 't even see the game . We went back and some woman asked me to hold her seat , so I ... . Never mind . I know , that 's when they made us leave . Uh , are you a friend of the family ? No , I live here . Live here ? Oh , Brad , see , it 's not what you think . Mindy , he lives here with you , and you go out with other men ? Oh , yeah , but you see , uh ... Mork , Brad and I aren 't quite finished yet . Oh , I see , you 're still hungry . Mork ... I 'll whip up my special dessert . No , Mork . Oh , for you , le monde , mama . ( barks ) Stay . Maybe I should leave . No , Brad . No , Brad , stay . We 'd like to get to know you better . Mork . ( Mork whistling , humming ) You see , Mork and I live together , but I still go out with whoever I want . I mean ... Mindy , I ... I don 't know what your idea of a relationship is , but I-I 'm not a swinger . Well , neither am I. Oh , swinger . Baseball . ( swishing sound ) How about them Broncos ? Brad , I 'd really like to see you again . Oh , we 'll get together again . Soon . Hey , wait . You missed the bologna sundae . Your eyes are leaking . Are they ? That means something has hurt you , doesn 't it ? Yes . Brad did something , that slimemunger . I 'll follow him to the ends of the universe . I 'll vaporize his entrails . No , Mork . It 's not what Brad did . It 's that Brad misunderstood our relationship . That 's what made me sad . Ever since you moved in , guys have stopped asking me out . And then when somebody does finally like me , like Brad , well ... He think that you and I are ... Lovelings . Yeah . And then when I tell them we 're not , they either don 't understand or they don 't believe the situation , so I end up not going anywhere , I never go out . I guess I 'm feeling kind of lonely . It 's all because I 'm staying here , isn 't it ? No , it 's not your fault . It was my idea in the first place to have you move in . I just have to work this out . Night . ( door closes ) Hm . Leaking . Come on , Mork , get up . Breakfast . What do you want , pancakes ? Waffles ? Gladiolas ? Come on , you lazy Orkan . MORK : " Mindy , I know you are sad " because people think you and I are lovelings . " I don 't want you to be sad anymore , " so I 'm going away . " If people from Ork knew how to love , " I 'm sure I would love you . " But I don 't even understand what love is . Love , Mork . " You 're doing that very well , Eugene . Grandma Hudson , thank you for letting me work today . I need the money so I can buy my mom a birthday present . Oh , well , that 's all right , Eugene . What are you going to buy her ? The best present in the whole world . A catcher 's mitt . Wow , that 's great . And it 'll go so well with those shin guards you gave her last year . Oh , say , Eugene , uh , call me if any customer comes in . Okay . Guess who ? Uh ... Stevie Wonder ? What 's happening , Mork ? ! Hey , plasma , what it is ? What you doing with the suitcase ? You taking a vacation ? That 's what I came to talk to you about . If you were taking a vacation , where would you go ? I 've always wanted to see France . Kay-o ; dosvedanya . Or maybe the Swiss Alps . Hey , make up my mind . It depends on how much money you want to spend . Uh , six smackers . You can 't go to the Alps with six dollars . Then France it is . Arrivederci . ♪ Or France , either . ♪ Hey , bummer . Are you running away ? How can you tell ? It 's written all over your face . Shazbot ... I 've broken out in words . Psst . Can you keep a secret ? I don 't want you to tell Mindy where I 'm going . You see , I 've , I 've been a lot of trouble to her . Man , you aren 't going far on six dollars . You can 't even get a place to sleep unless you stay in a flophouse . Oh . Sounds perfect for a flop like me . Well , there are some places on Mission Street . But they 're awful seedy . " Seedy . " Oh , I love horticulture . Hello , Eugene . Good morning , Mr. McConnell . What 's this ? Looks like a suitcase . Yes . Well , somebody must have left it here . Maybe I better open it up and see if I can find the name of the owner . ( making soft ray-gun sounds ) Good heavens ! How did that happen ? I don 't know . ( blowing ) I told you never to sit on my throne ! I leave you two alone for five minutes , and the whole place goes to pot ! You scoff ? You don 't believe ? I tell you , the men from Venus are coming down to take us to their planet . They arrive ... Labor Day . Then they 're going to blow up the whole world ! And you sit there eating a sandwich ? Where 's the passenger list ? There 's only room on the escape ship for ... 1,000 people , and so far we 've lined up ... three . Pressure . I 've been walking the streets all day , trying to find recruits . My feet are killing me . Gad , those make my thighs sweat . Good-bye . I saw your signs outside ... the Friends of Venus ? I thought I 'd stop by to see if there 's anyone here I know . Do you know any of the Friends of Venus ? I know some people from Venus . I know one guy who 's kind of cute if you 're into short and fuzzy . His name is ( violent sniff ) . Gesundheit . No , no , that 's his name . See , he 's got a wife and a litter , and their names are ... ( raspberry , squeak and cheeks flapping ) I 'd hate to be the child stuck with a name like ... ( cheeks flapping ) A believer . A true believer . What 's not to believe ? You believe in people from outer space ? Shazbot . Nanu-nanu . Precisely . My name is Exidor . I 'd like you to join me . Well , if you insist . No . I mean , join our group , be one of us . Us ? Oh ... Well , right now , you see , I 'm looking for a fliphouse to flap in . That 's flophouse . Oh , flip , flop ... whatever . You can stay here with us . We 'll all work together . Oh , work . I finally got a job and a place to flip out all at once . Oh , Mindy will be proud of me . Mindy . Heavy sigh . Oh , Daddy , Mork ran away . You 've just got to help me find him . Oh. well , look , honey , I don 't know why he left , but maybe it 's the best thing . No , it 's not , Dad ! Mork is like a child here . He shouldn 't be out in the world alone . He has no concept of trouble or danger . Oh , Dad , if anything happened to him , ( sobbing ) : I don 't know what I 'd do . I don 't want him to go . All right honey , okay , take it easy , take it easy . Now , I 'll help you find him . But where would he go ? Oh , I don 't know . I 've been looking all morning . Oh , wait a minute , wait a minute , I just remembered something . This morning when I came in , there was a shiny metal suitcase right in the middle of the store . Mork has a shiny suitcase . And then the albums fell , and , and ... Eugene ... I don 't know nothing . I think we 've uncovered a clue . Mork , this is my philosophy for the Friends of Venus . I want you to study it and memorize it so that you can go out with me and convert the non-believer . I 'll study hard and let you know when I 'm ready . ( high-pitched hiccup ) I 'm ready . Very well , on your feet . Uh ... let 's pretend that , uh , I am a non-believer , and you try and convert me . Hey , you , non-believer . Good start . But we need more power in your voice , and more conviction . Oh , I see . Frey-und ... ! I have need of your attention . Friend , do you realize that the Venusians are coming down to Earth ? But they 're not coming here on Veterans Day , not on April Fool-es Day , but on Labor Day , Labor Day , Labor Day . Can you hear me , friend ? I hear you ! Are you ready now ? Can I get a nanu-nanu ? Nanu-nanu . Thank you , friend . Do you realize , friends , what they 're coming here to do ? Because they 've come down here to blow the Earth to smithereens ! But it 's not that bad , friend . Because they 're sending a ship down here to save 1,000 of us , and they 're making a list , and they 're checking it twice . Now , friend , now , you can either stay down here , in your disco , drug-infested inferno , or come up to Venus , and have your very own Venusian condominimum , with hot and cold running champagne and underwater dancing . You must apply now ! Mork ! Mork ... that was beautiful ! Why can 't you be more like him ? ! But ... there 's something 's missing . What we need is more of your experiences with the Venusians here on Earth . I didn 't meet them on Earth ; I met them on Venus . You 've been there ? Oh , yes , I 've been to all the planets in your solar system . Mars , Mercury , Pluto ? ! Oh , don 't ever go to Pluto ; it 's a Mickey Mouse planet . You see , Exidor , I have something to explain to you . The Venusians aren 't coming to blow up the Earth . They 're not ? No , you see , their technology isn 't prepared for space travel . It isn 't ? No , their highest invention so far has been the garbage can . It is ? And the only reason they invented that was to have something to tip over . Blasphemy ! I had high hopes for you , Mork . You 're crazy . Mork ! Oh , what a relief . Mindy , I didn 't want you to find me here . You know , I knew as soon as I saw that Friends of Venus sign , I knew you 'd be here . I want you to come home with me now . No , you don 't . You just say that 'cause you feel sorry for me . Mork , I don 't feel sorry for you . I feel sorry for me . I don 't understand . When I 'm not there , you 're free to do as you wish . You have a home of your own . No , what I have is an apartment . It was only a home when there was somebody in it that I cared about . Me ? But I get in your way ; you told me so . Oh , I know , and I 'm sorry . I was blaming you because guys stopped asking me out . And then when one did ask me out ... I know . I made a real crimluck of myself . It was my fault . Mork , I 'm a woman , and , and a woman just sometimes needs to be held . Mmm , that man Brad , you wanted him to hold you . Well , not him , necessarily . I really didn 't get a chance to find out . But yeah , every once in a while a little hug really does help get me through the day . What 's a hug ? Oh , you know , like ... Like ... like this ? Yeah . Oh . Soft . I can understand how this keeps you going . It 's got me going , and I don 't even know what it is . Mork calling Orson . Come in , Orson . ( humming ) Mork calling Orson . Orson ... ♪ I am calling you-oo-oo ... ♪ ORSON : What a terrible connection . Sounds like someone stepped on a frenkle 's tail . Just me reporting from Earth . And what words of wisdom are you transmitting across the universe today ? I learned how to make a human happy . I learned ... how to give a hug . And a hug is ? It 's when you wrap your arms around a human 's body and squeeze . I thought that 's what Earthlings call wrestling . No , in wrestling , you squeeze a lot harder until they sweat and go " Arrgh ! " They don 't sweat and go ( grunting ) when you hug them ? No , they just cuddle and go " Ah ! " Oh , hugging . Amazing what pleases the primitive tribes . I 'll never understand them . But Orson ? Yes ? It was good for me , too . Mork ! Yes , Your Immenseness . This is Mork , signing off from Boulder , Colorado , until next week . Nanu-nanu .

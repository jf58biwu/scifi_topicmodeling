 [ Urko 's Voice ] This is where they must be . Reported seen here and here . They 're headed toward the sea . Alien humans . " Astronauts , " they call themselves . And that renegade ape , Galen . Are you sure , Urko ? I am sure of nothing except they think differently ! They 're a threat ! And they must be caught . There are several settlements in this district . - Human settlements ? - Yes . Each one has an ape garrison and a prefect . I want you to go there . Alert every prefect in the district . Give him their descriptions . Every stranger is to be arrested on sight ... and this office notified . We 'll find them , sir . Get troops from the nearest garrison and bring them back to me . Alive ! - Unless they try to escape . - Yes , sir . Jason ? I expect them to try . Understood ? Understood , sir . Thanks . Thank you , Galen . Okay , what do you call it ? Okay , what do you call it ? An oper . Peel it . It 's good . An oper ? Okay . I 'm willing . It 's , uh ... - good . - I told you . [ Pete ] It looks like a bomb . Feels like a banana . Tastes like an orange . [ Pete ] It must be a mutation . It 's obviously tropical , but ... if the sun and compass aren 't loused up , we should be north of what was San Francisco . We should be eating apples and pears . - Right , Alan ? - I 'm sorry . What ? I said anybody ... who thinks that a magnetic disk is gonna get us home is strictly off his rocker . Try an oper . They 're good . - This is our only chance , Pete , and you know it . - If you say so . Every detail of our flight is recorded right here . It can tell us when , where and maybe even how we hit that time warp . If we can run that through a computer- - What computer ? Where , behind that tree ? No , not behind that tree , or that tree or that hill , maybe . But somewhere on this crazy planet , maybe--just maybe- - there 's a civilization with the same technical knowledge that we had . Even more . And , Pete , you can 't tell me that it doesn 't exist . Galen , tell me , you know this area ? Not very well . Are there any settlements here ? Not that I know of . And certainly not one with a ... computer , whatever that is . - We 'll have to keep searching till- - - [ Grunting ] Pete , Alan , a horse ! Come on ! Well , training hard , I see . Yes , sir , we were . Until two humans , strangers , came , attacked us and ran off . - I don 't know what they wanted . - Probably outlaws passing through the territory . Some of them are no better than wild animals . I 'll have the patrols watch out for them . More important , Tolar , is your son ready ? - Almost , sir . - Good ! Good ! Wait a minute . Hold it ! I 've gotta go back . - I must 've dropped the disk . - Alan , we can 't risk that ! Oh ! Come on . - I expect to be proud of you someday , young man . - Yes , sir . - [ Tolar ] You will be , sir . - Fine . [ Ape ] Hmph . Strange . You 're not serious ? I 'm getting it back , Pete . I don 't know how , but I 'm not leaving without it . What difference does it make ? Even if we were able to find a civilization that could interpret that disk , they 'd still have to build us a spaceship . They 'd have to be able to reverse the process . Even then , there 's no assurance we 'd wind up back in the twentieth century . I 'm aware of all that . Why take the risk ? Forget it ! I can 't . It 's home . It 's hope . I can 't forget it . Very few soldiers come this way , sir . How far to the nearest village ? Half a day . You should be there by morning . [ Galen ] That 's it ! - Are you sure ? - He was wearing a prefect insignia . And that 's a prefect 's house . You wait here . Wait . Why you ? That disk means nothing to you . But it 's important to you , and you 're my friend . - I know , Galen , but- - - He is my species , Alan . I have a better chance alone , really . He 's right . But I don 't think it 's worth the risk . You 'd do the same for me , wouldn 't you ? I 'll get your disk . [ Knocking On Door ] - Yes ? - My name is Galen . May I come in ? Yes , please do . Keep your fingers crossed . [ Horses Whinnying ] Horses . If Galen gets into trouble , we 're all gonna have to get out of here fast . Come on . - Thrown by a horse ? - Yes . - Where ? - Out there somewhere . I have been walking for miles . You can imagine how absolutely delighted I was when I saw your village . And what were you doing on your horse out there ? Scientific exploration . I am searching for artifacts of past civilizations . Don 't we have enough trouble coping with our own ? Well , I wasn 't exactly sure we had one . [ Laughs ] [ Laughing ] I think I 'm going to like you , young chimp . Yes , I think I 'm going to like you very much , indeed . How about something to drink ? Oh , yes , yes ! Thank you very- - Thank you very much . It can be a rather lonely life here . Gorillas , they have ... no understanding of beauty or culture . I 've been a prefect in this village for 25 years , would you believe ? You don 't look old enough . Come , come . Here you are . - Thank you . - Ah , are you traveling alone ? Oh , yes . - Yes , 25 years . Since I was your age . - Mmm . - To companionship . - Most certainly . That 's good . You ready , Alan ? Oh , here , hold this . Okay , let 's go . Rather nice , isn 't it ? One of the humans did it . You know , some of them are surprisingly talented , even artistic . So I 've heard . As a matter of fact , I have a theory . Take 50 humans , put them in a room ... with plenty of pots of color and brushes , give them enough time and eventually they 'll duplicate every masterpiece ever painted . [ Laughs ] Ahh , I wonder if this could be ... - one of your artifacts . - I-I don 't know . I 'd ... have to examine it . No , no , it can 't be . Too new . I have found quite a few artifacts myself over the years . Some of them are quite fascinating . Really ? Are you a collector ? Oh , just an amateur . But one finds strange things . For example , some of our ancestors must 've been excellent metal workers . Very advanced . But the use to which they put the metal was very primitive . For instance , I found a weapon . A club . Beautiful workmanship , but so inefficient for combat . The quality of the metal is higher than we can produce today . A lost art . Interesting , huh ? Oh , very , very , very interesting . You know , that disk seems to be made of the same metal as this . - May I see ? - Any particular reason ? You seem quite eager . [ Sighs ] - Curiosity . - [ Chuckles ] - That is certainly characteristic of us chimpanzees . - Oh , yes . But let us refrain our curiosity until a later time . - You 'll stay for the night , of course . - Oh , I 'm not sure- - Oh , yes , you must . I wouldn 't dream of letting you go . We must find you a place to sleep . Should we tie him ? He 's not gonna be moving for a long time . This isn 't Central City . Our accommodations are simple . Ah , there 's so much I 'd like to discuss with you . So many aspects of life that we could- [ Horses Whinnying ] - What ? Shh ! Out here , both of you ! They 're not from my village . I never have this sort of trouble . Of course ! The two outlaws Tolar saw . Put them in the cage . Oh , yes ! There 's a comfortable hut that I 'm sure would be suitable for you . [ Chattering ] - Hey , Pete ! Pete ! Wake up . - What ? Come here . What are they gonna do to us ? [ Alan ] Does anybody know ? Look , we 're not your enemy . You don 't seem to be getting through to them . Look who 's coming . What 's gonna happen ? Do you know ? What do you think you 're- - These books are my closest friends . Hmm . The prisoners , what will you do with them , sir ? I found this one many years ago in an abandoned underground shelter . Really ? What about the prisoners , sir ? Why should you care ? They 're only human . Well , they ... walk , they talk , they breathe . You sound like a revolutionary . They 're humans . The only animal on Earth that wars on its own kind . I know . War and revolution are the natural outlets for man 's aggression . Man must be kept docile and unwarlike . So , we must find less dangerous outlets for his hostility . Do you agree ? Yes ! But what does that have to do with- - They 're thieves , my young friend . They 're strangers . But they will serve a noble purpose . What do you mean ? Come . I think you 'll find this interesting . [ Cattle Bawling , Goats Bleating ] - Do you know my fondest wish ? - No . To remain here for the rest of my days as prefect ... with my books , my flowers and my humans . There . Which one ? Good . All right , it 's time . A small ambition , of course , but its fulfillment would give me great pleasure . Get back ! Both of you ! You , come ! Come ! [ Laughing ] Tolar ! - Prefect . - Are you ready ? - Yes , sir . - And your son ? Soon , sir . Not today ? Please , sir . Not yet . Why ? - I don 't think- - - It 's his stomach . His stomach is not good today , sir . - Very well , not today . - Thank you , sir . [ Blowing Horn ] The father is a fine human being . But the son is a problem . He has no proper appreciation of the games . What are the games ? His attitude will change . - It will change with his first kill . - First kill ? [ Drumroll ] [ Drumroll ] [ Drumroll Continues ] They seem so tense . They 're waiting for blood . It 's their nature , human nature . [ Scoffs ] Not all humans . All humans . And I give it to them here in the arena . Normally with a challenger from the village . They work out their aggression . After the game , they live peacefully and quietly until the next game . That 's the secret , my young friend . All the human hostility in my village is used up here ... and nowhere else . [ Horn Blowing ] [ Blowing Horn ] It 's time for me to go through the usual nonsense . But they seem to expect it , and it does seem to help . Welcome to your games , humans of Kaymak . Welcome to your hero , the greatest fighter of Kaymak . Welcome to Tolar . [ Crowd Cheering ] All honor to the man who will face death . [ Cheering ] Bring in the challenger . [ Crowd Shouting ] [ Drumroll ] [ Drumroll Continues ] The game will begin . To the winner , life . To the loser , death ! Take it easy . Take it easy , pal . They 're like children , aren 't they ? [ Knocking On Door ] Barlow ! Prefect Barlow ! [ Cheering ] [ Crowd Chanting ] Sword ! Sword ! What 's happening ? [ Chanting ] Sword ! Sword ! [ Crowd Shouting ] Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill him ! [ Crowd Chanting ] Kill him ! Kill him ! Jason . [ Crowd Shouting ] Galen ! Galen ! - [ Rifle Shot ] - Out ! Everybody out ! [ Shouting Continues ] [ Gunshots ] - Virdon . - No time . Later . - Well ? - We 've cleared all humans off the street . - Any injuries ? - Nothing serious . One of my troopers was slightly hurt . I 've never seen the humans so- - A trooper hurt ? By a human ? Don 't you have any guns ? My orders are that guns are used only as a last resort . You may go . Your reports always described this as a peaceful village . It was ! I mean , it is ! - The game wasn 't complete- - - The games ? You don 't govern with games . You govern with this . And you don 't allow two important prisoners ' escape . I had no way of knowing they were important until you came . Must you play with that ? Thank you . Now let 's see the one prisoner you haven 't lost . Or not yet , anyway . Father ? Fresh water from the well ? You should have some light in here . Leave it closed . But , Father ? The dead have no need of light . - And the living ? - He disgraced me , Dalton . Why didn 't he use the sword ? Why ? I 'm not sure , Father . I think- - I 'm a dead man who breathes . He did this to me . He spared your life , Father ! Can that really be bad ? A man without honor should not live . Where did your friends go ? Where is their meeting place ? There is no meeting place . I told you . - You tell me where it is or- - - Jason , I don 't approve of this method of- - I 'm not interested in your approval ! I 'm warning you- - I 'm still prefect here , and I forbid it ! Enjoy your title , Prefect Barlow . You will no longer have it once I make my report . Prefect , thanks . Why did you ever come here ? [ Knocking On Door ] Can we come in ? We need to speak . - This is Galen , my friend . - Friend ? An ape ? Yes . It 's possible . - Hello . - Hello . - It is possible , isn 't it ? - We need your father 's help . Yours too . Our friend is in the cage . We have to get him out . No ! You 've disgraced me . But in this house , we 're loyal citizens . And we won 't help you disgrace the prefect too . My friend is a human being . They 'll take him back to Central City . They 'll kill him . He 's a stranger . We owe him nothing . You owe me something . You owe me your life . Yes . And for that , you will leave my house . Father ! He 'll stay . And if I can , I 'll help . So , now you are ... the father . I 'm sorry . I can 't turn him away . The approach you are taking with that man would not have worked . Some men do not respond to force . I have made a study of human behavior . You 'll have a chance to tell Urko all about your studies . He doesn 't share your tender concern for humans . Ah , but my way is practical . It controls humans with a minimum effort and cost . Yes , I saw an example in the arena . The people reacted because they need death in their games . - They didn 't- - - Games ! [ Scoffs ] I 'm sick of hearing about your games . But it 's true . Human behavior : violence , hostility , aggression . My way keeps them from- - Wait a minute . I 'm such an idiot ! Your way . Your humans want a death . We should let them have the prisoner . Don 't you have to bring him back ? Officially ... yes . You , um , you needn 't send that report . I have a feeling I shall continue as prefect . You 'll see how my theory works . Humans more important than apes . - There really was such a time ? - I was there . - What happened ? - I don 't know . But I can guess . War . Killing . Men destroyed each other , themselves . But , in the arena , you didn 't kill my father . - I had no reason to kill him . - It 's the way of the games . I had no reason to kill him . In your time , did all humans feel this way about killing ? It depended on the war . There were some who wouldn 't kill for any reason . Pacifists . They figured human life was just too special . Do you understand this ? I 've never understood the need to kill . It 's a thing for humans . My mother was a pacifist ... I think . Someone 's coming ! It 's the prefect . In there . Hurry . Prefect . How is your father , Dalton ? Ah , Tolar . And how are you ? Ashamed , Prefect . Oh , the man who fought you , he should be ashamed , not you . Yes , I- - - Prefect- - - I think you should lie down , Father . - And I think he should know . - There 's nothing for him to know . What ? What is this " nothing " ? My father 's disgrace . How much it troubles him . It will be forgotten . I promise you . The game 's tonight . - And they will forget . - Tonight ? Yes ! The torches will be lighted ... and you will bring back honor to your family . You will fight the friend of the man who disgraced your father . And this time there will be a death . Is that understood ? I want no error . There will be ... a death . You say you 're from another time , I hear . - You and your friend . - Yes . Tell me , is it ... better than now ? Well , it 's different , but it 's home . Of course . Just as this is home for me . That 's why I 've- - Oh , I 'm sorry you ever came to my village . - Any of you ! - No sorrier than I am . We had no choice . When you picked up that magnetic disk , I had to get it back . It was that- - that little thing ? That 's why Galen came to- - Oh , I wish he 'd simply told me about it . I 'd have given it to him with my blessing . You can still do it ! Give me the disk and let me go . To search for your home while I lose mine ? I 'm sorry . Truly . But the time for choice is past . It 's impossible . How can we do it ? I don 't know . But it has to be before tonight . I don 't think we can swing it alone . Wait . I 'll be back soon as I can . Dalton ? Tolar ? Dalton ! Dalton ! I loved your mother very much . What would she tell me to do ? A man is not a woman . She said ... there was no honor in killing . She said . But she loved me . She would never have noticed me except for the games . I would 've been nothing except for the games . How many men have you killed , Father ? The prefect created the games . They brought peace to the village . How many men have you killed ? As many as I have fought . As you will tonight . But I have no reason to kill him . It 's the way of the games . Is it ? It is the nature of man to kill ! - Why didn 't the stranger kill my father ? - What do you want of me ? Prefect , I think the games are wrong . I 'm not going to fight . - I order you ! - I can 't ! It ' s wrong ! I have to tell others in the village , to make them understand it 's wrong ! - You 'll do no such thing . - They have to know what 's been shown to me . They have to know that the games are wrong ; that killing is wrong ! Sergeant ! Sergeant ! This human has broken curfew . That 's all I need . Destroyer ! You destroyed me , now you 're destroying my son . - Take it easy , Tolar . - You tell him killing is bad . And you ! What have you ever done but kill ? You killed my honor . Now you 're killing my son 's manhood . - You 're wrong . You 're wrong ! - Tolar ! - Your son , he 's been arrested . - What ? Your son has been arrested . He 's been thrown into the cage . What do you mean , Dalton in a cage ? He 's been arrested because he was against the games ! My son ? - Did they have a plan ? - No . If they 're smart , they 'll take off . Take off ? That means to leave , go away . An expression from my time . In your time , if there 'd been no killing then , men might still be important now . That 's true . It 's possible . It could still happen . - [ Guard ] No closer . - I want to see my son . Nobody sees the prisoners . No humans are allowed on the streets . He 's my son , and I wanna see him ! Don 't do it , Tolar . Go home . Look , look , all I ask you , both of you , is a little pity . A little pity for a poor human whose son has been condemned . I don 't understand you now , and I never will , but that 's no reason for anybody to put you in a cage . [ Rifle Shot ] - Stop ! Stop before I - - - Run ! - Stop ! Stop before I - - - Run ! [ Gunshot ] No ! [ Gunshot ] Nobly done , my friend . - He 's dead . - Yes . As you saw , he died a hero 's death fighting a crazed human . B-But I could 've- - Your bravery is not in question . I will see you are properly cited in my report . Thank you . We must not allow unfortunate incidents like this ... to interfere with our normal routine . [ Hoofbeats ] Come on . No . Please . My father ? He was a brave man . - And the games ? - I 'm afraid they died with him . Perhaps there is a better way to govern . There must be . Tell your friends , I have never met them , and they have never met me . Yes , Prefect . And wish them good luck for me . - That way . - Are you sure you won 't go with us ? There 's so much for me to think about . So much I still don 't understand . - Could be dangerous for you here . - That isn 't important . What is important , I think , is that killing should stop . People should know that . Killing should stop . - Good luck . - Good luck , Dalton . Bye . A beginning . Who knows ? The world could sure use another one .

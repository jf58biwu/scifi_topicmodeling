 - You know how it works , right ? - Yes . Shit , I 'm sorry . If you had to point to one thing that prompted your illness , what would it be ? PSYCHIATRIC WARD I was ... just sad . I was much too sad at that time . How did it manifest itself ? I ... I ... Hi . That 's mine . Will you come to me , afterwards ? She 's my wife . I have to give her a chance to come home . Yes . Mads was away on a business trip and I was at home with the boys . And ... they were in the garden . They were always in the garden and I was in here . And I had a few drinks . Then I left ... And I forgot them in the garden . That 's when Mads found out , I think . And I was sent away . Which was a good thing . - What did you do ? - I got something at Aunt Charlotte 's . - I think Aunt Charlotte 's nice . - So do I . Yes , she 's nice . - Mum 's not staying at the hospital ? - No , she 's better now . - Won 't she behave badly anymore ? - No . - It 's embarrassing when she does . - Hey , you ... Your mum 's the most beautiful woman in the world . Tell your friends that . - She 's fun too . - She 's lots of fun . Yeah , lots . - Hi , boys . - Hi ! Are you coming ? Take off your shoes . Take off your shoes , will you ! Hey , boys ! Those little brats ... . The house looks so nice , Mads . - Are they for me ? - Yes . Everything looks so nice . Look ! How wonderful . - Hi . - Who 's that ? This is Michelle . She helps me with the kids and keeps the house tidy . Hello , I 'm Michelle . Welcome home . You 're a nice person . - Do you get along with the boys ? - Oh yes , they 're perfect angels . They 're crazy about Michelle . And Mads ... Do you get along with him ? - Yes . But ... he 's very messy . - I 'm not . - Yes , you are . - I 'm not . Yes , you are ! Just think , you 've taken care of everything here in my house . And you 've taken care of Mads . Have you slept with him ? - No ! - Just tell me . Have you ? - No ! - Kira ... We don 't need you anymore . Go away . Just go . Get out ! Do you think we 'll make it this time ? What 's the matter ? - There are people out in the garden . - There 's nobody , honey . Yes , there is . Look ... There 's nobody in the garden . Come on ... Yes , there is . They 're bringing tables . There 's John and Winnie . - What are they doing , Mads ? - I don 't know ... - Maybe I invited them . - Are we having a party ? - Yes . - For me ? Sweet Mads ... Get dressed . Mads , did you have an affair while I was gone ? - Of course I did . - No , you didn 't . - Yes , I did . - You did ? - No , of course not . - That 's not what I heard . - Oh ? What did you hear ? - That you had lots of affairs . Yes ... But apart from those , I didn 't have any . - Why didn 't my father come ? - I didn 't call him . - He doesn 't like me . - No ... He doesn 't like anybody . Aren 't you getting dressed ? I thought that was why you didn 't visit me . Because you had an affair . Listen ... I didn 't have an affair . Okay ? Get dressed . Put on your black suit . The one I got you when you turned 33 . I 'm not 33 . I refuse to be over 30 . You 're only 35 , two months and 1 1 days old . - I don 't want to know . - You 've got an age phobia . Yes , I like having an age phobia . It keeps me young . - I thought that I kept you young . - Yes , and you . Especially you . - I 'm over 30 too . - Yes , 31 , 1 1 months and two days . The fastest are usually around 30 . Joyner , for example . Before she died , she was about 30 and fast as hell . You 're handsome , Mads . You 're the handsomest man I know . It 's good to see you . Hi , welcome home . Welcome home . You look great . Cheers ! Cheers ! - Can you see me ? No , you can 't . - We can see more than enough . We can hear you . I wanted my wife to really feel that she 'd come home . How does one do that ? By inviting her to a restaurant or to Tivoli or on a trip to Mallorca ? Tivoli 's closed . No , I said to myself ... It has to be the real thing . I 'll ask all my dull friends for dinner so they can drink lots of red wine and talk a lot of rubbish . Then she 'll know she 's come home . She 's here . Where she wants to be . I 'll take this opportunity to promote her , not because she 's for sale ... But because I want her to know how much I care about her . - My wife is beautiful . - Yes , she is . She 's kind , she 's a good mother . I love you . Eat and drink , dammit ! Cheers ! There is an old , old poet . A Danish poet who is known all over the world . He writes poems that are called " Grunk " . That 's right . He 's written ... Easy now . He 's written a lovely little poem that is just right for today . " Love while you do ... " Help me , will you ? How the hell does it go ? - That was a nice speech , Mads . - Thanks . I just need to be alone for a minute . - Shall I ask them to leave ? - There 's no need to . It 's the shoes . They 're too small . - We can exchange them . - No , I don 't want to exchange them . They were a present from the boys , I don 't want to exchange them . Come on , let 's join our friends . - I 'm just going for a walk . - No ! I can 't stand being with all those people right now . Stop that ! - Okay . - Okay ? I 'll just go for a little walk . Hi , Papa , it 's Kira . I 'm downstairs in the lobby . I 'll wait . - Are you all right , Papa ? - I 'm fine . The Alfa 's just been fixed , so everything 's great . Sit down . Did you become the man you wanted to be without Mummy ? I don 't want to discuss it . With your mother I was just a nobody , running around like a poisoned rat to earn enough for the rent . When I got home I 'd just sit there staring at the wall . - Was that her fault ? - No , it 's was me , I know . But I just didn 't want to live that way . So I left you . All of you . I could see that Tove did just fine . So I chose myself . That 's how it is . I chose myself . All right ? I chose myself . I chose myself . I 'm not very good at emotions , and with Tove it was all emotion ! There were emotions everywhere . The walls were painted in emotions . No , I wanted my life to be different . I wanted to live like a tourist . You know when you walk into a café in a strange country and order a cup of coffee . That 's how I wanted my life to be . - You 're very beautiful , you know . - And then you left us . Yes , I did . I 'll have to live with it . So that was the reason ... Mads , I think you should leave me . No . No ! Why not ? - Because I love you . - How ? How ? Like this . - Hi ! - Hi , come on ! - This is a non-smoking area . - Really ? I 'm sorry . Come on , Mummy ! Who can make the biggest splashes ? Tobias ! Emil , come on up . Hey , you ! This pool is for children . Come on up , madam . They 're not much fun . What are you doing ? - What are you doing ? - Come on . Take it easy . Come on . No ! Not my boys ! Don 't take my boys ! - Relax ! - Let go ! Let go ! Let go ! No ! Jesus Christ ! Stupid bitch ! Look at that . Crazy bitch ! You 're sick . Julius ... - Come on . - Stay here . Don 't leave the building . Not now ! Excuse me . I 've reported your wife to the police . - Why ? - She kicked me in the head , man . Oh . I 'm really sorry . - Hi . - Hi . Where are your clothes ? - In there . - Go get them . Come on . Are you going to leave me now , Mads ? No . - Are you sure ? - I work . I make money . I make sure everything 's all right . Why don 't you get a job ? I don 't know ... There 's nothing I can do . You can run fast . Nothing 's going to come of it , Mads . - Take advantage of your talent . - I can 't . People who can run fast are in demand . For running errands , running over things , running after busses ... You 've grown so beautiful , Mads . Have I ? You 've become so relaxed . You 've grown older . It suits you . Your tics are gone . When we met , I remember how your whole face would vibrate ... All gone . When I look at you , - - I 'm so proud that you 're my husband . It almost makes me cry . I wish I could ... reach you . Really reach you . But I can 't . Don 't get me wrong . It 's not your fault . I just can 't . - Mads , let 's have one more child . - I don 't think so . - Why not ? - We 've got two already . - I think it would be good for me . - I 've got to get to work . - That business dinner ... - For the contractors ? I 'd like to do it for you . I really would . - I really would . - I 'll think of something . I 'll be back late . I 've spent all afternoon sorting this out ... - What about dinner ? - I 'll grab something on the way . - Come on , boys . - Are you taking the boys ? - Why ? I can take care of them . - Sure . But I think you need a rest . - Okay ? Come on . - Bye , Mum . See you . Turn that thing off . Do as I say . - What 's your name ? - Gustav . I 'm from Malmö . Excuse me . - Why are you sad ? - What the hell do you mean ? - You 're down ? - Unhappy ? Yes , I think so . No , I 'm all right . Maybe you 've been sacked ? Or maybe your wife has left you ? No , I never married . I could never hold on to anybody . Though I 've tried . They just seem to slip through my fingers . It could be that ... I don 't need women . Perhaps I hate women . - They always want a lot of children . - And lots of clothes . They fill the bathroom with strange stuff and their family 's always there . - Yeah , the family . - It 's better to be alone . You 're beautiful . And strange . Very strange . You think so ? I greet you most beautiful country on Earth your sun , your sky your green meadows ... Good morning . Mads , it 's me . I 'm in Malmö . Yes , Malmö . They 've built a bridge ! Please come and fetch me , darling . Just a minute . Excuse me , what 's the address here ? - Open the door and I 'll tell you . - I 'm afraid to . Just tell me . I won 't tell you unless you open the door . Hang on . 24 ... I 'm back . It 's ... 24 Sundholmgatan . Where are your clothes ? - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm her husband . Your bag . Thanks ... for coming . I worried about you . Everybody 's been looking for you . Take off those shades . Come on . Take them off . Take off those shades . Take off those damn shades ! Are you totally useless ? ls there anything you can do at all ? Just show me one thing you can do . Do you think you 're a good wife ? - Yes . - Are you supportive of me ? Do you help me ? Do you support your husband ? Do you help the children ? Do you help us ? Do you ? Can 't we just go somewhere and be together ? No . No hotel , no adventure . We could just lie together , and talk . I don 't want to fight . A proper wife ... if she has an affair , nobody notices . She doesn 't call home : " I 've been fucking around , please fetch me . " She comes home with a plausible explanation ! Mads , I don 't want to do this . I don 't want to run around town and end up in Malmö . That 's not what I want . I 've just become this way . Since that time . I 'm sorry , Mads . - I have to take you back to hospital . - I 'm not going back . I 'm not sick . I 'm not sick . - I 'm not sick . - Yes , you are . Yes , you are . You 're sick if you do something like this ! - You 're sick ! - I 'm not sick . You don 't love me anymore , Mads . - That 's not the point . - Yes , it is . - Love is always the point . - No , not in the real world . Here the point is to behave in a way so that other people can stand it . You 're no fun anymore , Mads . You 've become so joyless . You 're dull . Unimaginative . Stupid . You 're just a tiny , mediocre man in a really big suit ! I 'm bored . I 'm bored . I 'm bored . I 'm bored with you . I 'm bored . Come on . You know what your mediocre husband did ? He had an affair with your sister . - Do you love her ? - No . No . I just want a life . An ordinary life . In a way , it 's a good thing you had an affair . Are you okay ? You know ... that dinner for the contractors ... Wouldn 't you like to arrange it ? This is the restaurant , which seats 200 . Your party could take two smaller tables or the main table . - We 'll take the long table . - Fine . You 're starting with Canadian lobster au gratin , then the deer with Waldorff salad and soufflé with lemon sorbet for dessert . Yes . And you 'll make sure my guests have their glasses filled ... Sure . And after dinner I suggest that you have coffee and cognac in here where we can create a more intimate atmosphere . - And a traditional almond cake ? - Fine . Almond cake for 14 . - When does the music start ? - At nine p.m. - Is it ... dance music ? - Yes . And here we have the casino with roulette , blackjack and poker . This is where you have the chance to strike it rich ... You can play various games at the roulette : Straight up , dozens ... That is , columns from 1 to 12 , 13 to 24 and 25 to 36 . You can change your money into chips ... Oh , my God ... Thank you . My guests will be here in an hour . I 'm back . They 'll be here in an hour . Do you want me to help you ? Don 't , Mads ... Don 't ... Thanks . - Do you want to jump on the bed ? - Yeah . I won . - Good evening . - Hello , Mads . I 'm Kira , Mads 's wife . So what do you supply ? The windows . - Good evening . - I 'm Kira . What a beautiful dress . - Rolf Nielsen . - Kira . So what do you supply ? - Gutters . - Plastic gutters ? Plastic , copper , zinc ... everything . - Indoor installations ? - Wires , plugs ... This is my wife . - And what do you supply ? - Doors . Good evening . Welcome . I 'm Kira , Mads 's wife . - And you supply .. ? - Nothing . I 'm Mads 's boss . Welcome . I 've arranged a nice dinner , so I hope it 'll be a success . That 's that , I guess . Cheers . Welcome . I hope you 'll have a pleasant evening . We 'll have coffee in the lounge , and there 'll be music later , should anyone be in the mood for dancing . Welcome . Enjoy your meal . And there 's a casino , so if anybody wants to go crazy ... I 'm not an expert , but I think that if your number 's up you get 36 times the amount you 've put down . - Or you can bet on black or red ... - If you want to be bored . Cheers ! Waiter . Waiter ! Waiter ! Can we have some wine at the big table ? - So they 're both at kindergarten ? - Yes . They go to the same one . We 're very pleased with it . It 's just the local kindergarten . It 's great for them to have each other . Are you mad ? I have a son who 's mad . I 'm just a little bit mad . My son is completely mad ... Ouch ! Is she playing with the food ? Cheers , Rolf . That 'll teach you to keep your fingers to yourself . I hoped she wouldn 't notice ... We also supply something : A house that is completely finished . A house with doors , windows , wiring ... But if you don 't deliver , we can 't ... You make it sound as if we don 't want to deliver the goods , Mads . The conditions are exactly the same as they were 10 years ago . - You get paid for delivering . - Can we improve the production ? Right , gentlemen , it 's time for a dance . Who 's first ? Not now . You have to make your companies live up to our requirements . - How about you , Lars ? - Not right now . Come on , darling ? Not right now . We haven 't had this kind of problem before . I 'd like to dance with you . I think I know what you 're thinking . Just hold on . My son is very sick . He 's let go completely . I feel I 've lost him . Poor you . I can 't reach him . I try to help him , but he doesn 't want help . Just hold on . Yes ... - We 've wasted a lot of time ... - I 'm not giving you a lame excuse . I 'm explaining our dilemma . - Who 's next on the dance floor ? - Not now , honey . - Won 't anybody dance now ? - Not now . I 'll dance with you . - You 're a marvellous dancer . - Thank you . - Did you take classes ? - No ... Well , ages ago . Mads is a hopeless dancer . He 's so clumsy . But ... he 's always working . He loves his work . You couldn 't have found a better man . He works day and night . When we 're on holiday , he brings his work and his cell phone with him . In fact , it 's as if he had a mistress . Without sex , of course . At least I hope so . Do you know what I think ? I think you should go to your room and stay there till the party 's over , before you spoil everything . Don 't you think that 's best ? Cheers , boys . We 'll work it out . Mads ... I 'm going up to my room . I 'm a bit tired . You are ? Go and have a rest , then . Good night . Good night . What 's going on ? TRIED ... I MISS ... I WAS FUN I thought you were tired . - What are you writing ? - A letter . - To whom ? - To you . - What does it say ? - Wait ... - What does it say ? - Wait , please ... " Mads . I 'm afraid that I 'll disappear . " I 'll disappear ... " So I have to talk to you . You 're not here . " " I just wanted to dance , that 's all . " " I guess I 'm not the one you want anymore . " " You want the one I used to be . " " I 'll never be her again . " " I 've tried . " I 've tried ... I 've tried ... " But it 's as if you miss me , even when I 'm there . " " So do I . " " I miss the girl I used to be . " " I was fun and quick . " " I could always make you happy . " " You were a tall , skinny beanpole in a denim jacket . " " Covered in mortar , always putting bricks on top of each other . " " I was so in love with you . " " And then ... " " Then we bought the house and you were so proud . " " You were the first one in your family to buy his own house . " " Then we had the boys . " It 's nice talking to you like this . Alone . It 's so quiet here . It 's impossible to live with me , I know . I do unforgivable things . I 'm ashamed . Especially for the boys . I can 't do the simplest things . They don 't need that kind of mother . I 've just become this way . She only lived for three days . When we buried her , I took your hand , but you pulled away from me . You wouldn 't hold my hand . Why not ? She was so tiny . The sun was shining . I screamed . I screamed ... She was stuck inside me . But you wouldn 't talk about it . You were busy . Too busy to go to the meetings with the doctor . Too busy to visit me . But it 's all right , darling . I think you were better off without me . " You won 't have to pick me up in strange places anymore or worry about my behaviour . " " Because I 'm leaving you now . Take my sister . She 's right for you . " " I just want to see the boys often . " " I love you . " " I have to go through with this , so it 's best if we don 't talk before I 've gone . " " Love , your mad wife , Kira . " Where will you go ? You can 't cope on your own . There 's nobody to take care of you . You 'll be in trouble after five minutes . Is this a new game , the silent thing ? That 's the game ? Is that the game ? Papa , it 's Kira . Did I wake you up ? Please come and fetch me . Yes , now . In Elsinore . Thanks . Are you leaving ? Let 's do it properly , then ! Do it properly this time ! Stay away from me and the kids . I came there often in the beginning , the first time you were admitted . I was there all the time . Every day . But there was that smell , that clean smell ... A hospital smell . And my wife , crawling up the walls . The next day she 'd just sit there staring out of the window . Wouldn 't look at me or talk to me . And that smell ... Coffee ... I always had coffee , when I sat there , waiting for you . Waiting for you to turn around . Jesus , how a cup of coffee can smell in a place like that ! It drives away that clean smell completely . I could make that cup of coffee last for hours . But then that smell returned and I just had to go . When she died , they gave us tea . Remember ? They were really kind to us , but tea ? It doesn 't quite take the smell away like coffee does . All the time , when I sat there waiting for you to turn around , I 'd think : In a minute , she 'll turn around . She 'll turn around and talk to me . And she 'll say , " Mads , that tie doesn 't go with your shirt . " " And why did you put on those awful shoes ? " I tried to visit you but I couldn 't . This letter ... it 's the most beautiful letter I 've ever had . I 'll get it framed and hang it up in the house . At home . Please dance with me . Kira . Come on , let 's go . Kira , I hate this damn place , let 's go . Please , Kira , let 's go now . Wait , Papa . A bottle of champagne , please . On his bill . - On this gentleman 's bill ? - Yes . Over there . And that awful music . Jesus ... Well ... here 's another daughter . This is quite the family get-together . Charlotte , come and sit here . Never mind those two . Have some champagne . One more glass , please . How are you ? I miss you . - What are they doing ? - Are you asking me ? No idea . I guess they 're dancing . Mads called and told me to come with the kids . " It 's over now , " he said . - It doesn 't look that way . - No . What 's this ... My baby . There , there ... Subtitles : Ellen Gammelgaard SDI Media Denmark

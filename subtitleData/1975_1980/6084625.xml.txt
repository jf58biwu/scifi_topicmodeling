 Nanu , nanu . ( loud clank ) Shazbot . ( opening musical theme plays ) There . Mork , I 'm leaving now . I 'll be right down . ( singing Orkan song in squeaky voice ) I 'm ready ! Let 's go ! Ah , where do you think you 're going dressed like that ? I 'm going to the shower with you . But Mork , this is a bridal shower for a girl who 's about to get married . Oh , on Ork , when we get married , they don 't give them a shower , they just hose them down . Mork , you don 't understand . A shower is another word for a party . Oh , we 'd better take an umbrella , then , because I heard on the radio that it 's going to be cloudy with scattered parties . I 'm sorry , Mork , but you can 't go with me . See , this is just for women . Men aren 't allowed . But I want to be with you . And I want to be with you , too . But , you know , you really should get out and meet more friends . You need to broaden your horizons and grow as a person . Oh , you 're rejecting me because I 'm short . Oh , I 'm not rejecting you . But it 's just not fair that I go out tonight ; you have to stay here all alone . Remember , you can learn something from everybody you meet here on Earth . That 's very true . The garbage men today taught me to never lie on the curb on pickup day . Mork , what were you doing lying on the curb ? Well , I was watching some ants mug a grasshopper when he came by . And I suppose you 're going to tell me that the garbage man picked you up and threw you into the truck ? No , he said he couldn 't do that unless I was tied and bundled . Mork , this is all very interesting , but the point is that you need to go out and meet other people . I don 't know how to do that . Just be friendly . Oh , you mean like this ? Hi , friends , Sal Worthless here , Worthless Motors . I 'll eat the chrome off a trailer hitch just to get me in my parking lot . Let 's all react . This is my wife Spot and my dog Chuck . No , it 's my dog Chuck and my wife Spot . If you believe that , you 'll buy this watch . We 're just squealing to make you a good deal . You don 't have to put on an act . Just be yourself . ( in squeaky voice ) : Gizbah , funmeega . Put on an act . And ... put on your clothes . Morning , everybody . FRED : Oh , good morning , honey ! Did you enjoy yourself at that shower last night ? Well , it was really kind of different . Beth said that she and Jim are going to take separate honeymoons . Separate honeymoons ? Yeah . They 've been living together so long , they need a little time alone . Well , dear , where 's Mork this morning ? Oh , he 's out in the neighborhood making new friends . Ah , well , there goes the neighborhood . ( laughing ) Why don 't you just admit it , Daddy , I know you like him . Yeah , I 'd sooner be tied to an amplifier at a Grateful Dead concert . That can be arranged . Oh , excuse me , do you have Neil Diamond ? Only in my dreams . Susan ? Susan Taylor ! I don 't believe it . Mindy ! Mindy McConnel ! I haven 't seen you in three years . What are you doing dressed like that ? What do you mean ? Aren 't you a nun ? What ? Me ? Whatever would give you that idea ? Oh , wait a minute . Wait a minute . Uh ... Peace Corps . Airline stewardess ? Oh , come on , I know it was one of those unselfish professions . No , I was never going to do any of those things . Oh , what a shame . You would have made such a sweet nun . You always were so sweet . Well , thanks , but I work here now . Gee , it must be so exciting working in a music store , selling the instruments and sorting the sheet music and dusting off whatever . Susan , you aren 't still mad at me because of Jack , are you ? Jack ? Jack , Jack , Jack , Jack , Jack . Oh , you must mean Jack Peterson . That devastatingly handsome captain of the football team that you stole behind my back . Who is now president of the National Bank of Boulder and wanted to marry me and by now would have given me a $ 200,000 home , 2.4 beautiful children and the possibility of high regard in the community . That 's the one . Gee , I never gave that a second thought . So , what have you been doing since graduation ? Oh , nothing much . I was a little depressed about Jack , so ... Susan , I never went after Jack . He 's the one who chased me . Mindy , dear , you 'll just have to help your father with the inventory . I have a bad case of wiener fatigue . Okay , Grandma . Susan , don 't go away . I want to talk to you later . Don 't worry . Hi . Would you like to be my friend for life ? What 's your name ? Bug off , creep . Oh . I 'm Mork . May I just call you Bug Off ? Nanu , nanu . How 'd you like a knuckle sandwich ? Sorry , I don 't eat meat . Is there anything I could do for you ? Yeah . Get out of my sight . Oh , hide-and-seek . I know how to play that game . ( counting in Orkan ) Infinity ! Here I come ! Boy , he 's good . Whoa ... you 're a very interesting specimen . What 's your name ? Bug off . Wow , déjàvu , I just met your brother . Why don 't you take a hike ? Oh , football . I know that one ! We got a good ball game , it 's gonna be a good ball club . ( shouting gibberish ) ( speaking in slow motion ) I got it , baby ! I got ... aah ! I 'm in the zone ! I 'm in the zone ! ( whistles loudly ) I know . It 's too much craziness . Yeah . This is a music store , you see , not Mile-High Stadium . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Hudson . Do you know where Mindy is ? Yeah , she 's in back . She 'll be out in a few minutes . ( singing in silly voice ) I didn 't realize you were a friend of Mindy 's . Oh , yes . We live together . Oh , really . That 's interesting . I 'm Susan Taylor . I 'm Mork . Nanu , nanu . Whatever . Oh , are you a friend of Mindy 's , too ? Oh , yes , yes , from way back . Well , since we 're both friends of Mindy 's , why can 't we be friends together ? Oh , Mork , I think that 's a wonderful idea . We should be friends . Close friends . As a matter of fact , I think we should celebrate by going out tonight . Oh , Kay-o . You want to pick me up ? If you insist . Is that what you do on a date ? Yeah , well , whatever turns you on . That did . Uh , so , what-what do you drive , Mork ? Oh , a Grembo Pasati . Oh , marvelous . Is that a foreign car ? Oh , not where I come from . I bought it from Gezo Geb . ( singing jingle in Orkan ) It 's been in the shop for three bleems . That 's okay . We can use my car . Um , tell me , where do you live ? Oh , one-six , one-nine , Pine Street . It 's just a hop , skip and a churnel from here . Great . I 'll pick you up at 8 : 00 . Oh . Oh , hi . Mindy , you 'd be real proud of me . I made a friend right here in the store . You did ? What 's his name ? Oh , it 's a she . It 's a human specimen named Susan . When she found out we were living together , she wanted to be my friend real bad . ( chuckling ) : I 'll bet she did . In high school , Susan had a habit of collecting friends ... Oh . other people 's friends . Oh , she sounds real friendly then . Yeah , well , that 's the game she plays . Oh , that and football , and I 'll see you after the game . Rick ' em , rack ' em , rock ' em , rock ' em . Get that ball and really fight ! Mork , what are you doing in there ? You 've been in that bathroom for over an hour . MORK : Taking the worry out of being close . Well , you 'd better take the worry out of being late because Susan 's going to be here any minute . ( singing in Orkan ) Whoa ! Mayday ! Mayday ! Volgar the Enforcer ! Over there ! Mork , what are you doing ? The sacred flame is burning . It 's a candle and it 's burning because I just lit it . Wait , wait . You 're safe . Ah . Phew ! Phew ! What a relief . I was scared Orkless . Why ? On Ork , when the sacred flame is lit , it means that Volgar is coming to torture you . I thought you Orkans had done away with violence . Violence , yes ; torture , no . Mork , there 's no such thing as nonviolent torture , except for The Gong Show . Oh , no . Volgar is even more terrifying than Chuck Barris . What they do is , they march you up to the Sacred Kraal , and then ... Oh , no , no , it 's too terrifying to even think about it . They stretch you out and they tickle you by candlelight . Thank God it 's never happened to you . Well , a few guys have tried , but ... Oh , that means that Volgar is coming , it 's terrifying . The mere thought of it , well , it makes me laugh . Ha ! No , shh . Mork , why would they want to torture you ? You see , before I got this assignment , I got a speeding ticket from the Stellar Patrol . They said I was going the speed of light in a speed of sound zone . I would have stopped but I didn 't hear the siren until after they arrested me . What happened , didn 't you pay the ticket ? Well , Orson said he fixed it , but I 'm still terrified of hearing ... ( imitating siren blaring ) Yeah , I 'd be a little worried if I heard that too . Right , it means that Volgar is coming and it strikes terror into the hearts of jaywalkers , speeders and those who tell jokes . Telling a joke is a crime on Ork ? Only if it gets a laugh . Mindy , I 'd really like it if you came along with me tonight . Mork , group therapy is fine . Group dates I am not into . But I need you . I need your advice . Just be polite . Be a gentleman . Pull out her chair . Ah , practical jokes . Onk ! No , no , that 's not what I mean . Oh , see , wrong again . That 's why I need you . I have no need to sit through an entire evening with you and Susan . Oh , I see . Jealousy rears its ugly head . ( laughs ) Me , jealous of plain old Susan ? Boy , that 's a laugh . ( doorbell rings ) First of all , I 'm not the jealous type , and secondly , what 's to be jealous of ? Susan . May I come in ? Oh , sure . You look , uh , different . Thank you . I took a bath . Did you ? He 's such a kidder . Oh , yeah . Mork 's never serious . Oh , Mindy , I hope you don 't mind that Mork and I are going out tonight . Oh , of course not . Mork can do whatever he wants . That 's so sweet of you . Yeah . Well , I guess we should be going . Plain , old Susan . Oh , Mindy , it 's just such a shame that have to stay here all alone . Oh , well . I asked her to come along , but she said she didn 't want to go . Well , oh , if you insist , Mork . Oh , and Susan , you and I have so much to catch up on . ( playing aria from Carmen ) Fred . Fred ! What 's the matter with you ? I haven 't seen you so happy since the Beatles broke up . Well , it isn 't every day I gain a daughter and lose a Mork . Fred . Huh ? Huh ? Fred ! Fred , what makes you think they 're going to split up ? Oh . Well , Mindy told me what happened last night , and apparently Mork wants to see a lot more of Susan . CORA : Why , hello , kids . Well , hello . Did you have a good time on your date last night , Mork ? Yes . We went to a big parking lot with a giant TV in the front . Oh . How did you like the movie ? I didn 't watch the movie . Aha . MINDY : He was too busy looking at all the cars . Well , how do you know that ? Because I sat between them . But why ? Because I couldn 't get Susan to sit in the back seat . It didn 't matter , though . I didn 't see anything . All the car windows were steamed up . Gosh , I 'd hate to count up all the car windows I 've steamed up in my day . ( phone ringing ) I 'll get that . McConnell 's Music . Oh , hello , Susan . Yes , he 's here . Just a minute . It 's your girlfriend . Oh . Susan . Whoa , oh ... ( mumbling ) Yeah , she 's gone now . Yes . ( chuckling ) : Oh , yes , whoa ... Yes . Okay , I 'll tell her . Bye . Ciao , arrivederci , chelan delecito . Mindy , Yes . Susan asked me over for dinner , but she said to tell you that she only has enough food for two . That 's the most insulting thing I ever heard . Oh , Dad . Mindy , can I borrow some money to buy her some flowers ? No , that 's the most insulting thing I ever heard . How can you as a self-respecting human being ... ? Uh , whatever . How can you , how can you dare to borrow money from my daughter to take out her friend who is only trying to steal you away from her , and obviously wants to get her hooks into you ... Is $ 20 enough ? ( doorbell rings ) Coming . ( doorbell rings ) Hello , Mork . Good-bye . I brought you some presents . Oh , thank you . Here 's five dollars . Thanks , but I already have one . Oh . Then here 's some vegetation . Oh , thank you . ( sneezes ) Oh , you ... ( sneezes ) You 're welcome . Mindy picked them out . Yes , well , I 'm , I 'm allergic to daisies . Oh , she must have forgotten . I 'll bet . Well , tell me , Mork , uh , what do you and Mindy talk about when you 're all alone together ? Lots of things . I tell her everything . Hmm , well , she 'll just love hearing about what happens tonight . Are you two , uh , very close ? Oh , yes ; sometimes we stand right next to each other . Ah , well , that 's very interesting . I , I think I 'd like a little wine . All right , if you insist . ( whining ) I 'll get the bottle . Oh ... Susan has a pet . Long tongue . Oh , and well-trained . So , tell me , what do you do with your days ? Oh , today I went to see a cowboy movie . ( cowboy drawl ) : Jeb , I hate to say this , but I 'm in love with your buffalo . Yeah . Would you open the wine ? Oh , yes , ma 'am . If there 's some trail dust that has to be washed out , I 'll get right at it . What are you doing ? ! It 's open . Look at this mess . Oh , I 'm sorry . I , I 'd better head back to Mindy . Uh , no , no , no , no , Mork , that 's all right . Uh , I , I can get a new dress . And a new sofa . And a new rug . Uh , why don 't we just change the mood a little ? Oh , that reminds me of a joke . These two Venusians walk into a bar . One says to the other , " Ee-vizbah . " The other one replies , " Arg , nimnull , arg . " I guess you 've heard it . The other one is , how many Martians does it take to screw in a light bulb ? 8.2 . Arg ! Oh ... does the name Volgar mean anything to you ? This is no time to joke . Just stretch out and relax . Oh , no ! You 're not going to stretch me out in your Kraal ! ( cuckoo clock strikes eight times ) Waah ! Volgar the Enforcer ! Oh ... you 're not going to tickle me- - not at least alive ! ( shouting frantically in Orkan ) ( babbling continues ) Whoop ! Too late ! Oh , you 're crazy ! Hey , you 're crazy if you think you 're going to let Volgar tickle me here . ( shrieking ) All right , now , stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! No ! No ! Don 't tickle me ! Don 't tickle me ! Don 't tickle me ! Ahh ! Mindy ! Mindy . Mork , I didn 't hear you come in . Oh . Shall I go back out and come in noisier ? Do whatever you want . Kay-o . ( tromping footsteps ) ( door squeaking sounds ) ( squawking ) ( shoes squeaking sounds ) You want to hear about my date ? Oh ... I know what you 're doing . It 's called the silent treatment . We used to have it on our planet , but we banned it because we thought it was an earthy thing to do . So , how was your dinner ? I don 't know . We didn 't get to eat . Yeah , it looks like you were too busy doing other things . Uh-oh . ♪ Ring around the collar . ♪ Mork , do you think I 'm jealous ? Why should I be jealous ? What you and Susan do on your date has nothing to do with me , and that 's that . Don 't you want to hear what happened ? Down to the last sordid detail . All right , here 's the Reader 's Digest version . Ding dong . Here 's some flowers . ( in falsetto ) : Thank you very much . ( pretend sneeze ) ( falsetto ) : I 'd like a little wine . ( whining ) ( singing in Orkan ) Long tongue , whoop , homing instinct . ( speaking Orkan ) ♪ Da-da-da-da-da-da . ♪ ( falsetto ) : Would you open it ? ( regular voice ) : Sure . Psshh ! Ahh ! ( sputters ) Oh , no ! Whoa , do you know anyone named Volgar ? ( falsetto ) : Ah , no , no , ah ! ( regular voice ) : No , whoa , ah ... General destruction . Ah , I can see it right now- - blood , death , everything . Ah , don 't tickle me , don 't tickle me , don 't tickle me ! That 's what happened . Oh ... Oh , Mork , I 'm so sorry your date didn 't go well . It didn 't ? Well ... I guess it wasn 't a total loss . At least you learned something from it . You know , I learned something about myself tonight . Like what ? I didn 't want to admit it , but I was jealous . Why ? I don 't know . You and I are ... We 're best friends . You know , we 're buddies . We 're pals . Oh , I think I understand . Mindy ... What ? I 'd like to kiss my pal . All right . Oh , pulse . Rapid heartbeat . Temperature rising . I get it ! What did you get ? I think I know what made those car windows steam up at the drive-in . ( mimics remote zapping ) Ah ... Well , you want to watch television ? ( crickets chirping ) Mork calling Orson . Come in , Orson . Mork calling Orson . Come in , Orson . Orson to Mork . Orson to Mork . Orson to Mork . Orson to Mork ! Well , have you made any new discoveries on Earth ? Yes , sir . This week I met a new female specimen . Whew ! MORK : Her name is Susan . And she tried to kiss me . ORSON : Why ? I don 't know . It 's an old Earth custom practiced frequently by lovers , relatives and talk show guests . Did you kiss her ? No . I wanted to kiss my pal . Good thinking , Mork . ORSON : Wait just a grindle ! Isn 't that the girl Mindy ? That 's my pal . Your life is starting to sound like a real soap opera , Mork . Just remember , your mission is to report objectively about life on Earth . Don 't get involved ! You can count on me , Your Immenseness . I 'd be the last one on Earth to get involved . ( sighing ) Oh , this is Mork , signing off from Boulder , Colorado . See you next week , Mindy . I mean , I mean Morson . Whew ! An-nu . An-nu . Whoa . ( self-conscious laugh ) Mmm ... oh . Ciao . ( theme music playing )

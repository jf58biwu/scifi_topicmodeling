 See , the weight on the end pulls the line out from here , from the reel . - Let me try . - No , me . ( CHUCKLES ) It 's all right , you can both have a go . Let 's have a look . ( GRUNTS ) Put some more bait on that . Now , when you put the bait on , the bread , you got to roll it around nice and tightly . Got to be careful though , because the hook 's very , very sharp . - It 's got a barb in it . - What 's a barb ? Well , it 's a bit of the hook that goes the other way . Well , it means that when the fish takes the bait in its mouth , it means it can 't wriggle free . There , do you see it ? - Does it hurt ? - LAWSON : Some people say it doesn 't . GREG : Where did you spring from ? I saw you from the woods . The name 's Lawson . Robert Lawson . Well , I 'm Greg Preston . This is John and Lizzie . LAWSON : Hello . BOTH : Hello . - You 're learning to fish ? - You 've been ill ? Oh , yes , I was ill . How many of you ? - Ten . You 've come far ? - Far enough for one day . - Oh , we can put you up . - That 's kind , thank you . I 'm afraid you 'll have to go up that way and round the road . We haven 't gotten around to building a bridge yet . LAWSON : Perhaps I can be of help . Come on , kids . Oh , Abby , could you get me some salt ? I have to go back to the baby . - Please . Thanks . - That 's all right . ( SIGHS ) ( HUMMING ) GREG : Abby ! Abby , this is Robert Lawson . Abby Grant . - Hello . - Hello . I 've asked him to stay here . - Well , has he had the ... - Oh , yeah . He 's all right . - Then you 're welcome , Mr Lawson . - Thank you . - Don 't like the look of this weather . - ( CLICKING TONGUE ) Mmm . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) LAWSON : I 'm glad I 'm not out in that tonight . - Where were you making for ? - Oh , nowhere special . - Just looking around . - What 's it like now ? I mean , generally . We haven 't been far from here for ages . Well , there 's a kind of pattern emerging . You know , people are banding together a bit . You still come across loners , of course . - Like you . - No , no , no . I 'm not a natural loner . It 's just that I haven 't found a place I want to settle yet . But as I say , there seems to be a narrowing down of choices . Groups that have set up small communities . Like you , here . People grafting away to become self-supporting . And then there are the scavengers . Oh , we know about those . They 've been around here . Mmm , they 're like locusts . They clear out everything . Some of the larger groups must have some huge stockpiles . That 's right , they have . That means they 've got something to protect , so their places are like armed camps . But it doesn 't matter how much they 've got , sooner or later they 're going to run out and that 's the time people like you are gonna have to look out for yourselves . Yeah , well , we 've already had our fair share of problems with people like that . Mmm . There 's another group , too , they 're sort of nomads . They travel around together , stay in a place for a while and they move on looking for something better , I suppose . Of course , it 's getting harder for them , too , with most of the petrol gone . We don 't use too much of that ourselves , do we ? We think if we 're really sparing and we don 't use the tractor too much , we can make our petrol last for four or five years . Now , you 're lucky . I tell you , things must get worse before they get better . A group starts setting up , but they have different ideas and they become afraid of one another and that makes them insular . Well , that 's bound to happen , I suppose . I mean , we 're pretty wary ourselves . At least we don 't advertise the fact that we 're here . Well , that 's not quite true . There 's a settlement about 30 miles from here . They have quite a big stockpile of things and they seem quite glad to do some bartery . - We 've traded with them twice now . - That 's what it needs . I think that 's where the future is . Interdependence . I mean , there won 't be much advance until we have a common aim . GREG : No . And how long is that going to take ? Well ... Look , if you haven 't gotten any particular plans , why don 't you stay on for a while ? You can stay for as long as you like . You wouldn 't be committed . Thank you . I appreciate that . Look , I like what I 've seen here , I admire what you 're trying to do . Look , you don 't have to decide now . Why don 't you stay , as Abby says , for a couple of days to see if you can get used to the place ? Thank you . - Now , if you don 't mind ... - ABBY : Of course . Come on , I 'll show you your place . You know , one of the good things of having a house as big as this is that everyone can have a room of their own . Good night . Thank you for your hospitality . Good night . - See you in the morning . - Yes . - Good night . - Good night . Well , what do you think ? Well , he seems all right . - Travelling a bit light , isn 't he ? - How do you mean ? He arrived with only a gun . Yeah . He doesn 't look as though he 's been sleeping rough , either . Perhaps he 's one of that group with Little Barton . Why didn 't he mention it when Abby said about it ? - Oh , I know a good way to find out . - PAUL : What ? Ask him . We 'll tackle him in the morning . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Isn 't it loud ? I better go and see if the children are all right . I better give Charmian a hand . ( SIGHS ) ( WATER TRICKLING ) Mr Lawson ! Mr Lawson ! Breakfast ! We 'd better start replanting . Get them back in the ground . - What about the seed ? - I don 't know . A lot of them must have been washed out . And they were all we had . Well , there might be some left . I 'll go and check . Johnny , would you like to see the baby ? Hasn 't she grown ? Yes , but she sleeps all the time . She 's no fun really . She doesn 't . She kept her poor mother up all night . Now she 's quiet . - Aunt Emma ? - Yes . - You know the new man ? - Yes . Well , I can 't find him . Well , he must be somewhere . Go and have a look . - I have . Everywhere . - Go and look again . Go on . The drain 's completely blocked . Thing 's fixed now , though . How 's the garden ? It 's completely washed out . Greg , we 're gonna have to get some more seeds . But I 'm not sure that it 's not too late to plant anything now . - There 's nothing left at all ? - I don 't know . I 'm just gonna have a look . Oh , God . Everything . Every bloody thing ruined ! ( GREG SIGHS ) Why don 't you turn that in and grow a beard ? Because I don 't want to conceal the strength and character of my jawline . Because I don 't want to hide the classic beauty of my fine cheekbones . Apart from that I find beards always itch . You get used to it . - Any luck ? - No , nothing . Not a thing . I must have done the best part of 20 miles and not a sniff of it . - Bob not back yet ? - No . - Did you see anybody ? - Yeah , one place . They saw me coming and ran off into the house . They shouted at me through the windows to clear off or they 'd start shooting ( EXHALING ) I didn 't hang about . All right , let 's get something to eat . And then we 'll get out the maps and work out a new search area . - This wood 's all soaking wet . - Well , well , this is a surprise . It rains all night and now the wood 's soaking wet . I don 't think there 's very much more down there . It 's my own stupid fault for storing this stuff down in the first place . But I thought it was perfect , cool and dry . - ( SCOFFS ) Dry ! - How bad is it ? It is about as bad as it could be , Emma . It will be at least another couple of months before we have any sort of grain crop of our own . We can 't go on killing off our livestock . We 've got little enough left as it is since all the sheep were killed . GREG : Yeah , well , there always was a big question mark as to whether we could get through till next winter . Well , there 's no question mark any more . Look , we 'll just have to have another scout around the area . The whole area 's been picked clean and we all know that . - But what are we going to do ? - I don 't know . We might try a deal with those people at Little Barton . I mean , they got a warehouse stacked with stuff . A great stockpile . And you think they 're going to part with it just because we 've run into some sort of trouble ? - Well , we 've traded with them before . - GREG : I know . But we had something to offer them in exchange then . Well , we could ask them to lend us something until our next harvest . There 's not a hope for that . I mean , they drove hard enough bargains last time . And they know that everything we 're gonna grow this year , we 're gonna need to see us through the winter . They 're not gonna trade just on credit . You can 't blame them . But we must have something of value . Something they want . We have . The petrol . Yeah , right . They 'll trade for some of that . How much have we got ? Oh , there must be at least 1,000 gallons in that tank . We could ask for and get anything we want . I should say the petrol is the most valuable commodity there is . Then we 're rich . And Greg , can you give the tank a go ? There 's nothing wrong , I just haven 't finished it . - Then will you do it ? - Yes , sure . I 'll get out of these things and get on with it . Paul , we shall have to be very , very careful of how we use the tractor and the Land Rover . Look , let 's get all the oil drums and jerry cans we can lay our hands on and fill them up . We may as well have something by us for an emergency . - Right . - Come on , let 's make a list . I can 't find him . - Who ? - Mr Lawson . And I looked everywhere . You know , I 've just been thinking . I 'll bet we 'll never see another orange again as long as we live . You just thought of that , have you ? Well , it 's true , isn 't it ? I mean , there 'll be a whole lot of kids who 'll grow up without even knowing what an orange is . You like oranges , huh ? I mean , you really miss them ? Yeah , but that 's right , isn 't it ? I mean , lots of things , oranges ... Lemons . Pineapples , bananas . I mean , grapefruit . I mean , lots of things . - And it just occurred to you ? - I was just saying ... You know , there are times when you make ... When you really make me wonder . You haven 't actually thought about things at all , have you ? I mean , after all this time it 's only just occurred to you there 'll be no more imported fruit . - All right . - Have you any idea what this country used to spend on imported food ? Billions , billions of pounds . There wasn 't a single day in your life when you didn 't eat something brought in from abroad . - That 's not right . - Grain , chocolate , rice , cooking oil ... - Yeah , all right . Yes . - The list goes on and on . - Sugar , coffee . - Yes . Yes , and including that tea you 're swilling down now . All right , now don 't go on about it . Know all ! ( WHISTLES ) - Well , did you have any luck ? - Oh , so-so . Not bad . Wouldn 't mind some food though . I 've been on the move since about 5 : 00 this morning . You know , there 's plenty of time for that . - What did you find ? - Oh , a nice little commune . Friendly people . Had a meal with them . - Spent the night . - Oh , come on , mate . Don 't keep us in suspense . Did they have any ? - Yes . - Much ? Well , depends what you mean by much . What would you say to about 1,000 gallons ? - Do you mean it ? - Just sitting there in a road tanker . Enough petrol to take us anywhere we want to go . - And more besides . - Fantastic ! Are we going to have any trouble getting it ? Oh , well , they 're not going to be very happy about it , are they ? But , nothing we can 't handle . Now , if we can just find some big 50 gallon drums ... Drums ? What are you talking about ? We take it all . We take the tanker . ( ENGINE STARTS ) Keep the engine running . We 'll charge the battery up . - Come on . - Right . - Come on . - Now there 's two feet . - Hold ! That 's it . - Hold it . Okay . Well , you get yourself ready and then we 'll get started . Right . ABBY : Do you think we 've covered everything ? EMMA : I think so . - ABBY : Charmian . - I can 't think of anything else . Oh , we will , when they 're gone , you know . I 'm sure of that . Oh , you worked it out ? Yes , I 've marked the most important things . Well , the rest that aren 't so important . - Just do the best deal you can . - Yeah , okay . Incidentally , what 's the bloke 's name ? Buller ? Nabolia . Well , Jenny knows him . We met him the last time we went up there . There . - How long do you think you 'll be ? - Well , I should be back before dark . It 's only 60 miles there and back . - Jenny , you can leave . - All right . - Bye , Abby . See you later . - ( CHUCKLING ) Okay . But drive carefully . Before you go , I think you ought to take a look at the near side rear . Flat . Jenny ! Hold on , we 've got a flat . JENNY : Oh , no . - I can 't see anyone . - Okay . Now , let 's try and get this over with as little trouble as possible . Bob and I will go straight for the tanker . With a bit of luck we might even get it out before they realise what 's happening . If they do put up a fight ... - We want that petrol . - Come on , let 's get it done . Hello . You 've come back . - Where 's the tanker ? - Greg took it away . Where ? Where did Greg take it to ? What the hell do we do now ? I hope you 're right ... Now , we want that petrol , Abby . - Where 's he taken it ? - You 're too late . He can 't have gone all that far . Now , where 's he taken it ? Let 's get it out in front of the house . Abby , leave the boy here . Leave him ! Now come on . Come on ! - You dare hurt her ! - Just tell us what we want to know . - You 'll let her go ? - Yeah . It doesn 't matter anyway . You 'll never catch them . They 've got too big a start . Where are they going ? Little Barton . We 're trading the petrol for other things . Don 't raise any alarm until we 're clear . They 've got too much of a start . ( HONKING ) ( TYRES SCREECHING ) Whoa ! - Are you all right ? - Yeah , well ... - Never thought I 'd get around that bend . - I thought you were going off the road . So did I. Look . I 've never had the brakes pack up on me like that before . - Would you able to fix it ? Can we go on ? - ( SIGHS ) I 'll have a look . ( GROANS ) Can you see anything ? Well , the brake fluid 's gone completely . Oh , dear . - This is one of those awkward jobs . - How long ? Don 't know until I 've had a proper look . Look , we may as well get this under cover . Let 's stick it in that barn over there . - Just a second . - All right . ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( GREG GRUNTING ) ( HAMMERING ) GREG : Oh , that 's terrific . Really lovely . - Is it bad ? - Oh , the whole damn thing 's corroded . - Look at that . - Oh . Can you fix it ? I can do something , but I 'm gonna need some more tools , bits and pieces . Yes , but you can do it ? It can be done ? Oh , I can do a makeshift job , get us as far as Little Barton . Look , could you go back and get some stuff ? What , back to the house ? Yeah . It 'll take you only about an hour , down and back . You just tell Paul what I 'm gonna need . I 'm going to want the big tool chest , I 'm going to want some copper pipe , about that size , a blowtorch and then some brake fluid . There 's some lying around the house somewhere . Now , can you remember that ? Yeah , I think so . You want a blowtorch , some brake fluid , a bit of copper pipe like that and the big tool chest . Yeah , but wouldn 't it be better if you came back with me ? Well , if you go , then I can get started on this , get it stripped down . - It 'll save time in the long run . - All right . Well , this is definitely the shortest route . Yeah . It 's a secondary road . I think with a tanker , they 'd have stuck to the main roads . So what do you reckon ? Well , you pays your money , you takes your choice . I 'd plump for this one . Okay . ( ENGINE STARTS ) Hold it ! Switch it off a minute . LAWSON : What is it ? Just listen . There 's a car coming . - I don 't hear anything . - There is , I tell you . - I hear it . - Get behind the hedge and cover us . Stay out of sight until we know what 's happening . ( CAR APPROACHING ) That 's Jenny , the girl from the house . Let me handle this . Jenny . What a surprise . What are you doing out here ? I was just going to ask you the same thing . You went off in a bit of a hurry last night , didn 't you ? I wanted to make an early start . Didn 't want to disturb you . - Oh , Jenny . This is Jim Buckmaster . - JENNY : Hello . It 's nice to meet you . Robert 's told me about your settlement . I 'm going there now . I 've got to pick up some tools . Trouble ? - Well , nothing that can 't be fixed . - Anything we can do to help ? No , I don 't think so , thank you . I think Greg will be able to manage once I 've got the bits and pieces he needs . Is the tanker broken down ? Yes , we 've pulled it off the road so that it can get repaired . - How did you know about the tanker ? - You 'd better show us where it is . Well , I 've got to get the things . - Hey ! Let go of me ! - Get in the jeep . ( SHOUTS ) What ... Hey ... Look . Thorpe , get in ! Why don 't we just make her tell us where it is ? We don 't have to take her with us . JIM : We don 't want her running off to get help , do we ? ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( GRUNTS ) I can 't see anybody . Coast down quietly . - Greg ! - Keep her quiet ! It 's probably in the barn . Well , there 's no reason why he should suspect anything . I 'll go in on my own , get him off guard . And Bob , you cut around the back of the farmhouse and be ready when I make my move . Okay . Thorpe , you stay with the girl . Anybody here ? Anybody about ? ( GRUNTS ) Get up ! Get up ! Now you tell them to bring Jenny over here . - Come on , do it ! - You can 't ... Now just do as you 're told and you won 't get hurt . Come on ! Hey ! Bring the girl ! Are you all right ? Do what I say . Tell Thorpe to get the girl . Thorpe ! Bring the girl ! Don 't ask me . Better let her come over here . Tell them ! - What about me ? - You go when she 's safely inside . Let her go . You said I could go . You 'll listen to what I 've got to say first . - Now , did they hurt you ? - No . They want the petrol . Just give us the tanker . We don 't want to harm anyone . - You 're not getting any part of it . - Greg , there are three of them . Now you listen . That petrol 's about the only trading commodity we 've got . Now we need it for food and seed . 'Cause without supplies , we won 't be able to feed our people . Our community 's going to have to break up . Now I 'm not going to let that happen . So you just take your men and you get out of here 'cause I 'm telling you that there 's no way that you can win . I 'd set fire to the whole damn lot before I let you get any part of it . Now go on . Get out ! All right , stop it . Keep your heads down . There 's no point taking any risk . We 've got them pinned down so they can 't move . But when we make our move , we 've got to do it right . Look , Jim , it 's gone wrong on us . Why don 't we just forget it ? No , it 's not worth any of us getting hurt . Listen , there 's a fortune sitting in that barn . We can trade it for anything we like ! And they 've got no more right to it than we have . We 're going to get that petrol ! - What are they doing ? - They 're just keeping under cover . - Is there any other way in here ? - There 's a door down that end . Bolted . They 've a hard job getting us out of here . Then what can they do ? Well , they can 't do anything at the moment . It 's sort of a stand-off . I suppose they could starve us out , but that 'll take them a couple of days . If they did that , they 'd have to run the risk that Abby might send someone out to look for us . - What is it ? - They 're moving . Jenny , will you take his gun and go down to the other door ? ( DOOR CLANGING ) Greg ! The door ! ( GUN FIRING ) - I think they 've gone . - Yeah , for the moment . They 'll try again . They 'll probably wait until it 's dark , that 's their best chance . But they 're bound to win , aren 't they ? I mean , sooner or later they 're bound to win . How long do you think it 'll be before Abby sends someone to find us ? I 'm afraid there 's no reason she should suspect anything 's wrong . We can 't count on getting help from her unless we can get a word back . Yes , but how ? Look , when you were captured , did you see how many guns they had ? Um , they had three . They had one each . Are you sure ? It 's very important , Jenny . Yes , I think so . Yes , I 'm sure that 's all they had . Yeah , well , that means they 've only got two now . - And where 's the jeep parked ? - On the road , down by the gate . Why ? - Well , if one of us could get to it ... - What , go outside ? It 's the last thing that they 'd expect . - Look , if you could get to their jeep ... - Me ? Well , it 's got to be you . Look , if they 've only got two guns , they can 't possible cover all the angles of this barn . Now , if I draw their attention down at the front , you can get out through that door . Take it nice and slowly . Keep under cover . Quietly . And I 'll keep them busy down here and I 'll hold them off until you get back with help . Will you do it , Jenny ? It 's our only chance . 'Cause if you don 't , we haven 't got a hope in hell . Well ? There 's a door round the back . It 's locked . - Where 's Thorpe ? - Around the other side . - And I 'm gonna need some more shells . - Well , there 's another box in the jeep . Thorpe ! I think they 're gonna try and make a break for it . Jenny ! ( GUNS FIRING ) Now give him a couple back and keep him away from that door . I 'll go get the cartridges . ( ENGINE STARTS ) You out there , you hear me ? You 're running out of time ! All you got left now is about half an hour . Then she 's going to be back with more people than you can handle . Do you hear me ? Drop the gun ! ( GRUNTS ) Get in , Thorpe ! Open the door , Bob . We 've got it ! ( ALL CHEERING ) ( ENGINE STARTS ) Oh , my God ! Brakes ! ( THORPE CHUCKLING ) ( WHOOPING ) ( BOTH LAUGHING ) ( TYRES SCREECHING ) ( CRASHING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GROANS ) ( SOBBING ) You did this ! You shan 't have it , damn you ! You did this ! You shan 't have it ! ( GRUNTS ) It 's mine ! I took it ! It 's mine ! It 's mine ! - GREG : Turn that valve off ! - No ! - Nobody 's going to have it . It 's mine ! - Turn it off ! It 's mine ! It 's mine ! It 's mine ! It 's ... ( JEEP APPROACHING ) I should think we 've lost a little over 150 gallons . And three people dead . Is that what life 's worth nowadays ? 50 gallons of petrol ? God help us all .

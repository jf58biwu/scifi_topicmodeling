Boxey 's lost one parent . He won 't lose two . - You don 't scare me . - Do something . They 'll kill him . Bootes told me about your gun . It 's our only chance . 'There are those who believe 'that life here 'began out there , 'far across the universe , 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans .

Will try to make it back to you . Send help ! Recon Probe 3 . Where 's Blue Squadron ? I 'm running out of time . 'Galactica , Recon Probe 3 . ' Blue Squadron ready to scramble . - There will be no scramble . - But sir , Apollo 's in trouble . I know what he 's doing . He 's leading the Cylon patrol away from us . You couldn 't reach him in time . If you did , it would undo everything that he 's risking ... 'Recon Probe 3 . Where 's Blue Squadron ? I 'm running out of time . 'Where 's Blue Squadron ? I 'm running out of time . ' He 's not expecting any help , Boomer . Those transmissions are for Cylon ears . Flight leader to base . Pursuing Colonial viper , Hatari sector , bearing Delta 9 , Mark 7 . Pilot is attempting to reach Galactica . It 's about time . Surprise . Full booster , run out of fuel . First lesson you learn as a cadet . Thank you , Lord . Colonial viper has turned away . We have lost him on our scanner . Forget him . He is trying to lead you away . Continue on his original heading - Delta 9 . Seek the Galactica . I could have got him today if you hadn 't growled . - ( Growling ) - Yes , just like that . I had that old lupus in my sights and you spooked him . Don 't you understand , Strider ? The lupus is killing our stock . He 's bad ... like Red Eye . - ( Snarls ) - No , no . Red Eye isn 't coming . Boy , if I could get that lupus in my sights ... ( Viper approaching ) ( Viper stops abruptly ) Puppis , no ! Captain , you are one lucky pilot . ( Breathing heavily ) You OK , mister ? Hey , I didn 't mean to frighten you . I won 't hurt you . - Where am I ? - My mom 's place . - No , no , what planet ? - Equellus . Equellus ? Equellus . Wow ! It 's beautiful . You 've never been close to a starship ? I 've never even seen one . Bootes told me about ships that fly in the stars . I thought he was just making it up . Do you fly in the stars ? Not very well without fuel . - Who 's Bootes , your father ? - My uncle . - My father 's dead . - l 'm sorry . It happened a long time ago , when I was a kid . Oh . And you 've never seen another ship ? No freighters , tankers , fighters ? Yours is the first. ls it a fighter ? Puppis , move away from him ! Come here . Take it easy. I 'm not here to harm anyone . Don 't worry , my mom can 't hit the side of a granary with a numo . Puppis , get over here and light this torch now ! Yes , ma 'am . If he wanted to , he would have shot you , Mom . He 's fast . And wait until you see his gun . Would you be quiet and light that torch ? is that really necessary ? Shut it off . Thank you . Get back in your ship and leave - quickly . I 'd like nothing better but I 'm out of fuel . Then we 're going to have to hide it . It and you . - Cylons ? - What are Cylons ? If you don 't know , then there aren 't any around . Be thankful for that . What are you afraid of ? Please , just do as I say . Let 's hide it . Now . What 's going on ? is anything wrong ? Oh ! No . No , we 're just ... trying to keep some of the slower ships in formation . Hi , Starbuck , Boomer . Nope . Dad 's on patrol . He told me to wait up for him . Good Lord , I almost forgot . Your dad asked me to tell you that the patrol might go on longer than he expected . Longer ? How much longer ? Well , he landed on a planet to check it out . - Right , Commander ? - Yes . He 's going to be a little longer than we thought . He asked if we 'd let you spend the night in the bachelor officers ' quarters . - With the pilots ? - Yep . And we can have a couple ... fruit juices ... fruit juices , and talk shop and maybe even a couple of hands of pyramid . Can I , Grandpa ? Yes , you may , of course , if that 's what your father wanted . Oh , yes , he did . Oh , boy , I get to spend the night with the Blue Squadron ! Let 's go ! All right ! - Thank you , Starbuck . - Right . I 've never seen a numo before . - Fires on compressed air ? - lt can kill a lupus within ten metrons . - lt can ? - Well , lf you hit it just right . Mm. it 's very good . How long has this man Lacerta been taking tribute ? Nearly ten yahrens . He just lets us keep enough ovines to get by on . - Somebody should stand up to him . - Red Eye 'll kill ' em . Zap ! - He 's the one with ... - You 're forgetting your chores . - With the gun like yours . - Your chores . Yes , ma 'am . Leave it ! You don 't need a numo to feed the layers . - What if a lupus comes around ? - l said leave it ! I thought you said the only guns here were numos . What difference does it make ? A gun is a gun . I hate them all. lf it weren 't for the lupus that attack the stock , I 'd destroy every numo , every ... My husband was killed by a gun like yours . - l know how you feel . - Do you ? My wife was killed by a gun ... like mine . Someone 's coming . You 'd better go in there . ( Woman ) What do you want , Red Eye ? We heard a sound in town . Lacerta sent me to investigate . - Did you hear a sound ? - No . I did. I heard a lupus howl and a nightflyer hoot down by the woods . Those are not the sounds I am seeking . They 're not ? - You don 't scare me . - Puppis ! Why do you people persist in foolish acts ? - You cannot hurt me . - l can try . Did you hear the sound I seek ? ( Man ) Let ' em be . ( Red Eye ) What are you doing here , Bootes ? Dropped by to see my sister ... and I heard a noise . A noise ? Yeah , it crossed over my place , passed over this way . - Sounded like it went on into town . - ln town it sounded like it came out here . Well , you know these hills at night . Sound travels strangely. lt can deceive . Humans deceive , not sound waves . - Well , what is it ? Do you know ? - No , but I will find out . It would not go well for you to lie to me . You are both behind in tribute as it is . What is going on , sister ? Inside . Uncle Bootes , this is Apollo . He flies one of the ships you told me about . Am I glad to see you , Captain ! - You know who I am ? - l know what you are . A Colonial warrior - a captain ! And that , bless my eyes , is a laser pistol . And he 's fast . Faster than Red Eye , I bet . - Why didn 't you destroy him ? - He was afraid of hitting me or Mom . Hold on . How do you know who I am ? Puppis didn 't , nor his mother . Vella ? Vella knew . She just never told the boy . - ( Puppis ) Told me what ? - That your father was a Colonial warrior . A warrior ? A pilot like Apollo ? Very much so . Did he fly a fighter and wear a laser pistol ? Come on , Puppis , if I know you , you haven 't tended the flock yet . I want to know . I want to know about my father . I 'll tell you . Come on . What happened ? Bootes found Martin wandering in the field wounded and half-dead . ( Sighs ) There 'd been a battle up there among the stars ... and Martin crashed in the desert . He must have wandered for Lord knows how long . And I tended him . It took a long time . And we fell in love . I think he was happy here with us . I mean , as happy as he could be . He was stranded with no way to get home . But he never talked about it - except once . The night before our wedding , Bootes brought a jug of home-made buzzer . I was so mad I could 've strangled both of them . I guess he told my brother things that night he never told me . But I knew . I 'd find him outside , lying on his back , with Puppis on his stomach . He was just a yahren then , staring up at the stars . This ... Cylon , Red Eye - he was wearing a Colonial pistol . Martin 's ? One day , Lacerta appeared with Red Eye . We 'd never seen him before . And Martin went crazy the moment he saw him. I couldn 't stop him . He ran into the bedroom where he kept his pistol and when he came out ... That was nine yahrens ago and I can still see it like it just happened . - And you never told Puppis ? - No . And neither will my brother . - He 'll find out someday . - No . - He has a right to know . - No ! Puppis can 't go after the thing that killed his father , spend his life as a warrior , fighting , killing , dying . For what ? Why did Martin go after him like that ? Why ? Red Eye is a Cylon . They have one objective - to destroy all humans . Your husband knew that . But Red Eye , this Cylon as you call him , he hasn 't destroyed all of us . He only kills those who try to kill him . ( Apollo ) That doesn 't make any sense . I don 't know what 's going on but I will find out . How ? By going after Red Eye with your laser ? Yes ! Puppis tells me the captain is faster than a lupus . No. I 'll avoid the Cylon . I 'll go into town dressed in clothes like yours , unarmed . But you can kill him with your laser gun ! Where there 's one Cylon , there 's others . If they know I 'm a Colonial warrior , they 'll hunt down my ship . Or worse , destroy every human inhabiting this planet . When Red Eye killed Martin , he saw the laser pistol . He took it . No one came to hunt us down . I can 't risk it . No gun . You 'll just have to understand . I understand , Captain ! If you 're not man enough to use it , give it to me . No gun . This fruit juice is just ... Great . Yeah , it 's , er ... It 's terrific . Quit stalling . Are you going to call or not ? ( Starbuck ) Give me a few centons , will you ? - You 're eating your bet . - ( Laughter ) ( Sighs ) All right , call . - Three quarters of a pyramid . - That beats me . - Me too . - l 'm clean . - Well ... - Not so fast , Starbuck . A full pyramid . ( Laughter ) - Your deal , Giles . - Thanks , kid . - l 'm glad we 're not playing for cubits . - lf we had , it would 've been different . That does it ! He should have been in bed centons ago . And what are you hotshots doing teaching him to drink and play cards and smoke ? - lt 's only fruit juice . - He 's winning . - l 'm not letting him smoke . - Oh , you 're not ? Listen - to bed , young man . Cassiopeia , just one more hand ? Now . And no more smoking around Boxey . But I 'm sleeping in here tonight . That 's after you say your prayers - and wash and brush your teeth , OK ? - OK . And recirculate the air in here ! Boy , that does it . Next time you have a big game - don 't call . I 'm going up on the bridge , see if they picked anything up . They would 've told us . Yeah . We can 't just leave Apollo out there , we 've got to do something . Really ? Any suggestions ? One - if we can get the Colonel and the Commander to go along . - lf they don 't ? - Then we do it alone . Boxey 's lost one parent . He 's not going to lose two . ( ? Electronic music ) ( Men whooping ) What 's the wager , Marco ? Two bladers . Make it 200 . I don 't have 200 , you know that . Then fold . But I 've got you beat . I know . Vignon . Aren 't you going to apologise ? If it will make you feel better . The only way you stinking oviners will make me feel better ... is to stand downwind . Don 't tell me - you want me to move again , right ? Tell you what , will it be OK if I sit with my friend ? Friend ? Oviners have no friends . That one . My name 's Apollo . - l don 't suppose you want a drink . - l do not ingest consumables . In this case , you 're not missing anything . I 've never seen anyone like you before . - You are lying . - No . I sense you want to destroy me . - ( Music stops ) - You would not be the first . Nine have died trying . I cannot be destroyed by a numo . I can see that . You seem to have run into a few dents . Still , you will try . - l 'm unarmed . - That does not matter . Red Eye , sit . Lacerta wishes to see you . Does everyone jump when he snaps his fingers ? That 's fine for a machine but not for a human . You owe me your life . Perhaps I can return the favour . - What are you drinking ? - Vignon . The barman can bring it . Thank you . - Macy , who is he ? - l don 't know but he 's different . Thank you . You have courage . A foolish trait. lt gets men killed . Why are you here ? I heard of your Red Eye. I was curious . - Another dangerous trait . - Where 'd you find him ? Do not mistake my benevolent attitude ... for stupidity . What do you want ? - To work for you . - Why didn 't you say so ? - l had to impress you . - ( Sniggers ) By Equus , you 're right . Come back tomorrow . I 'll see what I can do . ( Music resumes ) Had to impress me . ( Guffaws ) ( Growling and snarling ) Oh ! - What 's wrong ? - A lupus attacked . Puppis was indoors but he went out a window . - Which way ? - Out near your ship , I think . Hurry ! ( Low growl ) ( Growling ) I did it ! I killed the lupus ! Yes , son , you killed the lupus . - Feeling good ? - l feel like I could fly . Yeah , I know . But your mom 's scared . She 's probably going to be very angry when she sees you . You mean she 'll treat me like a little kid ? Puppis , I know you 're a man . But your mom ... That 's going to take a little time . She loves you very much . Give her that time . - l think I know what you mean . - l think you do too . Apollo ? I know you 're not afraid of Red Eye . ( Footsteps ) Oh , Puppis . Oh ! You could have been killed . Didn 't I tell you never to go after them ? Never ! - l 'm sorry , Mom . - Sorry ? The scanners are still clean , sir . No sign of pursuit . - Evidently , Apollo 's ploy worked . - Yes . Adama , they want to go after him . - Starbuck and Boomer ? - Every pilot on the Galactica , - including me . - Don 't you think I do ? I 've been studying battle charts from the Hatari system for centons . It 's filled with planets and asteroids . If Apollo hasn 't been ... lf he hasn 't been shot down , if he 's eluded pursuit , if he 's been able to land on one of those surfaces , if he hasn 't run out of fuel , then he could be within our range for a few hundred centons longer . If , if , if , if ! So many ifs it 's incalculable . But possible . Why not slow the fleet , buy him more time ? Send a patrol back . Not deep enough to penetrate the Hatari system and risk detection , just enough to lead him to us if he comes out . All that effort and risk for the Commander 's son . That 's utter feldergarb and you know it ! If it was Starbuck or Boomer or a first orbit cadet , you 'd do it . Adama , don 't diminish his chances because he 's your son . We can 't bring the fleet to dead slow ... but launch a patrol when ready . Bridge , Colonel Tigh . Launch patrol . I guess there were two vipers ready . - Hi . - Hi . Did you two talk through the entire sleep period ? Yeah . He finally fell asleep a few centons ago . I don 't know how you stayed awake . I think I dropped off a couple of times . Boxey always used to keep me ... Boxey 's my son . Younger than Puppis but very much like him . It never occurred to me . You must miss him very much . Very much . That 's why I have to find Lacerta 's connection to the Cylon Empire . Red Eye 's proof they land here . They might have a fuel depot . Stealing fuel is my only chance of getting back . And I 'm running out of time . Apollo ... ( Growling ) ( Horse galloping ) It 's all right. lt 's only my cousin Jason . Red Eye showed up at Bootes ' a while ago . He took half their herd - tribute . Bootes started drinking and then he rode towards town . Do something . They 'll kill him . Bootes told me about your gun . Your gun is the only chance we have . I 'll go into town but no gun . Come on , come on ! ( Yells ) A man can only be pushed so far . He can 't work and bleed and turn everything over to some fat pig ! Pay tribute ... give up half your ovines ... perform like a trained daggit . No more . Not this oviner . You 've had your last tribute from me . - l think I have . - Right ! I 'm not afraid any more . One of these times , one of us is going to penetrate that tin-plated machine with a numo ! - Maybe it will be you . - Yeah , maybe it will ! Bring it on , Marco ! No ! - Stop him , Lacerta ! - The boy is armed . Give me that gun ! Please . Sit . I hate you ! We won 't give you any more trouble . I hope the rest of you will learn from the example of Apollo . He understands respect . That 's all I ask . That ... and a little tribute . - ( Boomer ) Halfway mark , Starbuck . - A little farther , huh ? A little farther and we might not get back . - Chop your power . - Have you gone crazy ? 'We can drift for 40 or 50 centons . ' We don 't spot him by then ... he 'll be out of range for good . - What do you say ? - Chopping power . - Vella , I 'm sorry . - No . They don 't understand. I do . You did the right thing . I 'm not so sure . I am . ( Apollo . ) I don 't have much time . He 'll miss me . What is it ? You 're different . We can all see that ... except Lacerta . You 've blinded him by the way you talk to him , appeal to his vanity . But not Marco . You put him down , and he 's working on Lacerta to kill you . I know Lacerta . He won 't stay blinded long . - He 'll unleash Red Eye ? - No . Marco wants to kill you to get back in Lacerta 's graces . He used to be his right hand before we found Red Eye . You found him ? Where ? The mountains . We were riding one night and we heard this roar and then an explosion . Pieces of metal fell like rain . Cylon fighter . What ? What happened then ? We found two others like Red Eye - destroyed . We got scared and turned the wagon to run . That 's when we saw Red Eye . He had that awful dent in his head and ... It was strange . He looked up at Lacerta and said , " By your command . " He 's been doing what Lacerta says ever since . - l gotta go . - Thank you . Apollo , my man Marco wants a word with you . Someone give this oviner a numo so I can bury his smell . That won 't be necessary . I , er ... Maybe I was wrong . Red Eye ! I knew he wasn 't a coward ! Puppis ! Oh , my God . Not again . Uh-oh . - ( Cheering ) - Congratulations ! ( Puppis ) Zap ! Zap ! Zap ! Zap ! Zap ! Zap ! Zap ! Bootes would have been proud of you , Apollo . Red Eye was fast but you were faster . Hey . Hey ! Hold it ! Hold it , Boxey ! - Puppis . - Someday I 'll be a hero like you . - l will , Apollo . - Now , you listen to me . Do you remember when you killed the lupus ? Did you feel heroic ? - l felt scared . - That 's how I felt against Red Eye . - No , you ... - Scared . You killed because you had to , even though you were frightened . That 's all I did , something I had to do . There was nothing heroic about it . There never is . I pray to God it 's something neither of us will ever have to do again . Apollo ... I know where Martin 's ship crashed . I don 't think it can fly but it may have the fuel you need . If it weren 't for Boxey ... - ( Boomer ) ' He 's out of time . ' - Let 's give him another centon . We did that five centons ago , Starbuck . I want to see him come out as much as you do but if we don 't leave now , we 'll never get back . Right . Firing my engines . ( Distorted ) ' Galactica , Recon Probe 3 , do you read me ? ' - Apollo ? - ' Do you read me ? ' Apollo , is that you ? 'Apollo ? Apollo , is that you ? ' Starbuck ? Got you on the scanner . Take an Omega 1 heading . - Apollo , here we come . - Yee-haaa ! - What are you guys doing out here ? - We just thought we 'd take a little ride . The stars are kind of nice in this galaxy . We 'd just about given up on you , buddy . - ( Beeping ) - Where have you been ? Let 's go home . It must be beautiful . He 'll be back , Mother .

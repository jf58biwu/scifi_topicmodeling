 - No one can get in . - ( Sapphire ) No ? No one from this time period . Where are you from ? Please wait here until you 're needed . ( Steel ) Psst . ( Creaking in next room ) 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' - Ah ! - ( Both gasp ) I was just about to ... No . No , I was just ... - Well , I was just doing something . - Yes . - So what was it ? - You were busy making a mistake . - I never make mistakes . - ( Steel ) Come here . I 'm unable to make mistakes . It 's built-in . - Instant reduplication never fails . - It did this time . - ( Steel ) Silver ! - Ohh . Open that . Well , can you ? It would help if I knew what it was . Just a minute . - Would you mind ? - What ? I think he wants us to go with him . Come on . Oh , this is them . What is that ? - What 's behind there ? - Why should we know ? - Because you belong in this thing . - We 're not ... - What ? - Well , we 're not engineers . - Are you historians ? Researchers ? - ( Rothwyn ) A little of both . - You don 't know what brought you ? - This did . - But not how ? You don 't know that ? - No . What can you tell us ? You 're in danger ! Do you know that ? - No . - Yes , we realise that . Good . Cos we put ourselves in danger because of you . - Then we must thank ... - No ! Don 't thank us . It 's not you we care about . - You 'll just have to guess . - Right . We are real ... and it 's our job to safeguard the structure of time - the past , present and the future , all of it . It was an experiment , that 's all . - ( Steel ) Experiment ? ! - Yes ! I mean , what 's the point of a future ? What 's the use of technology , learning ... If you can 't experiment ? If you can 't go bulldozing back ? - We haven 't exactly bulldozed ... - Shh . You came here hoping to play happy families but it 's gone wrong . - All right ... - You 're stuck here , stranded . You can 't even use the machinery that brought you here . And the language , you just about got that right . - Thank you . - But not the names you chose . You got those wrong by several hundred years . How 's that for learning ? How 's that for " accumulated technology " ? Oh , sorry . Um , do you think I might have that ? - ( Tuts ) - Allow me . Thank you . I need to tell them . Tell them what ? Well , there are others . Others like us , here . Two other groups . - We already know that . - Oh . But there 's an engineer in one , perhaps he could help . I 'm afraid it 's too late . Too late ? They 're all dead . Ah ! Something out of nothing . How did they die , the others ? We 'd like to know how they died . They killed themselves ... because of the danger , not only to them but to everything and everyone . Yes . - Would you have done the same thing ? - If it meant ... Cos you can always do it now , you know , save us a lot of trouble . No . Someone , some of us , have to tell them what went wrong to make sure it never happens again . - ( Steel ) Yes . - So we have to go back . If we can get you back , yes . And if you can 't ? How do these things work ? ( Melodic beeping ) ( Beeping continues ) I was there . - That 's the farmhouse ? - Yes . - You were there ? - Yes . - Well , that tells me nothing . - All right . Rural study group , room two , please . - Neither does that . The bedroom . - What ? The bedroom of that place , I want to see it . - Well , show me . - I can 't . - Can 't ? There 's no monitor ? - There 's a monitor in every room . Then show me that room ! If it 's a question of secrecy , there 'll be no secrets . - It 's not a question of secrecy . - Then what is it ? If you must know , it 's more a question of privacy , of decency . - Privacy ? - Yes ! Decency ? What is he talking about now ? I 'm talking about how unlike these times and the times in-between , we have acquired - or rather gained - certain standards . What kind of standards ? If you like , moral standards . Are you trying to tell us that it 's taken 1,500 years of troubles , wars and famines to learn not to peep into one another 's bedrooms ? - If you 're going to laugh at us ... - Then don 't preach . Save it for your own time . Now , show us that room . Rural study group ... room five , please . ( Blows ) ( Hissing ) Perhaps ... perhaps they 're asleep . No , they 're not asleep . ( Rothwyn ) And the third group ? The same thing has happened to them . - Please . - Switch it off . - This monitoring device ... - ( Eldred ) It doesn 't work properly . - What about between groups ? - Between ? Each group keeps its own log , its own recorded diary , right ? - Yes . - Do you have access to their log ? Of course , but they 're dead . Then it 's no use to them any more . So let 's hear it . I need to know more about the power system that brought you across time . - I 've already said ... - It 's built into this capsule . - It 's a kind of time ... time source . - Yes . Oh , so you do know that . - Yes , but only that much . - Only that much ? - Yes , and that some piece of ... - Machinery ? Yes , machinery was used to bring us back here . Well , why didn 't you ask what it was ? We didn 't think it was necessary . Well , that piece of machinery did bring you here and it 's keeping you here . But now it 's acting on its own behalf . It 's thinking for itself . It 's already caused people to kill themselves . Now what 's it got in mind for you ? And your baby ? But if we don 't know the answers ... - They might . - ( Eldred ) Yes . - ( Rothwyn sobbing ) - Oh , get her out of here . ( Door closes ) Their last log will be with them . ( Silver ) Yes , that 's about it . I can 't do much more without taking the entire capsule apart . - Not very sensible . - No . - What are you doing ? - Ah . This is where the time source lives . - Is it still here ? - Oh , yes . Uh , I think I heard your baby crying a moment ago . Look . - I know . Animal blood . - What sort of animal ? - I 'd need to do tests . - Then do tests . - That depends on whether Steel ... - I 'm sorry . It rather depends upon me , I need to know ! Look . Now , these are impulse stimulators - electronic nerves . - An artificial nervous system ? - Well , partly artificial . These would be used to trigger existing nerves and muscle , it 's a way of bypassing the original brain . Now , these ... As you know , these are the gadgets they use in scientific surgical operations . - Operations on living animals ? - Yes . It 's very advanced , it 's very sophisticated . - But still a form of vivisection ? - Oh , yes . - The sounds of pain . - What ? It 's just something Steel once asked and I didn 't know the answer then . - What was the question ? - The scientists of the future , 1,500 years in the future , what are they guilty of ? Do those tests , hm ? ( Man ) ' The children were included in the discussion . 'It seemed only right that they should be . 'The time unit that brought us here is to blame . 'It is responsible but not because of any malfunction . 'Its actions were deliberate . It has turned against us . 'It turned against us all . ' - Could it ? - Yes . ( Man ) ' It has played tricks with our minds 'and it is now our turn to be experimented upon . 'It urges us to escape into this time period . 'It wants us to become a risk , a threat to the past and the future . 'In other words , a threat to the whole human race . 'It has the power of time itself 'and we are no match for it . 'Therefore ... Therefore the only alternative , 'the only sure safeguard is our own self-destruction . 'This final entry is logged at 8 : 45pm , 'day 25 , old calendar . ' ( Echoing ) 'Calendar ... calendar ... calendar . ' ( Steel ) ' You said it was an animal , some kind of animal . - ' Well ? ' - I can 't make any sense of it . ( Steel ) ' What kind of animal is it ? ' ( Howling and shrieking ) ( Howling continues ) ( Howling stops ) It 's not one animal . It 's every kind , every species of animal . - In one small sample of blood ? - Yes . Where 's Eldred ? This is our private room ! We don 't expect to be disturbed . We want you to tell us something . About the future , the time you come from . We 've no objection . If you 'd wait outside ... - Tell us about the animals . - Animals ? - Yes . - What animals ? The animals that exist in your period . There are no animals . Not there , not any more . Only in children 's books , legends , things like that . - But none living ? - No . Well , we 've no further use for them . Well , no one would consider eating their flesh , not any more . No one has for the past several hundred years . - What about pets ? - Pets ? Domesticated . Animals in zoos ? That 's the past , the atomic age . - That 's history . - Yes . Anyway , the world , it 's better off without them . They were unclean , they were cruel and most of them carried some kind of disease . - Cruel ? - Yes . What about the scientists ? Oh , well , there 's that , yes , but that 's different . Well , what did they do ? Your scientists ? Well , the creatures that are used , they 're not really animals , not in that state . What exactly are they ? Just pieces . - ( Sapphire ) Pieces ? - Yes . - Pieces ? - Kept alive . Propagated , as pieces . Reproduced . But we never see them , of course . The public never sees them . Well , they 're never allowed out of the laboratories . Well , that 's where you 're wrong . What did he mean " wrong " ? What did he mean ? We 'd like to know what you meant by that . Whatever is in there did leave one of those laboratories , it came back here with you - it was made to , trained to . It 's responsible for bringing you back here . Pieces of animal and pieces of machinery made to work together , made to coordinate - perfected and then shaped into a time unit . Given a kind of mind , a kind of brain . - A brain ? - Yes ... - one that 's working against you . - Against us ? But why ? ( Scoffs ) Let 's think of a hundred reasons , shall we ? Or a thousand . Things that once ran wild but at least free , things that breathed and ate and produced their young , things that swam in the sea , things that managed to survive , once ... reduced to a few living pieces ? Well , it 's in here now , somewhere . It can hear us and it can see us and it only wants one thing from its encounter with the human race ... it wants revenge . ( Echoing ) ' ... revenge ... revenge ... revenge ... ' ( Howling and shrieking ) ( Echoing ) ' ... revenge ... revenge ... ' - ' Steel ? ' - ' Yes ? ' 'It 's broken free . It 's escaped . - ' It 's out here with us . ' - ' Where ? ' - ' I don 't know . ' - ' But it 's in the open ? ' - ' Yes . ' - ' Wait here . ' ( Sapphire ) ' No , Steel . It 's an illusion . ' Oh , my baby . Keep the child with us at all times . - Get them to take this capsule back . - Back ? You said you could contact their base . There 's enough power to make an emergency signal . - But I ... - Then make one ! Can you do it ? - Yes . - Get on with it ! You two , into the screening room . Quickly ! ( Sapphire ) Here ! ( Whirring ) ( Whirring intensifies ) It 's fighting us , Steel . Yes , but how ? ( Steel grunting ) ( Gasping for air ) ( Sapphire ) ' Don 't turn around , Steel . 'Steel , it let us in here , remember . 'Now we know why . 'It 's using us to help it escape from this capsule . 'We have to send it back before it can break out ! ' - ' Did I hurt you ? ' - ' We don 't have much time ! ' 'What about Rothwyn and Eldred ? We can 't send them back with it . ' - ' It is their problem . ' - ' We can 't ! ' 'They caused it , let them solve it ! 'It belongs in the future , it doesn 't belong here . ' 'Yes , well , first , we have to contain it . ' - ' Get it back in its hole . ' - ' How ? ' 'Lure it back . It 's made of all animals , it 'll eat anything . 'Feed it ! ' ( Rumbling ) He likes it . - What have you done ? - ( Sapphire ) ' We fed it . ' I want to know what 's going to happen . You 're going home , that 's what . Come on . Places everybody , please , quickly . Right . There 's the future . That 's home ! There 's home ! - Not ours , is it ? - Definitely not . - Sapphire , take your place , please . - Can I ask you something ? - It 's hardly the time ! - Yes . The figure , the man we saw . The one that made us sleep . Was that our child ? - Yes , it was . - ( Silver ) Very good . Hold tight ! ( Intense whirring ) ( Silver sighing ) - Well ? - It 's gone . - Just an empty roof ? - Yes . Steel ? You can 't leave like that , you know . - What ? - You put a knot in the lift cable . ( Sapphire ) Imagine a world without animals . ( Chuckles ) Yes , well , they 're not as clever as they thought . - What do you mean ? - They had mice in their capsule . ( Squeaking ) ( Lift creaking and straining )

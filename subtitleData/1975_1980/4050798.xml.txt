 - How we doing , Richard ? - We are 15 minutes ahead of time , sir . With this load on our back , that 's good going . Just trust the RAF , sir . - What the hell is that ? - The shuttle ignition . Disappeared ? What happened to the Moonraker ? Good God . Yes . Yes , of course , Minister . Right away . Moneypenny , is 007 back from that African job ? He 's on his last leg , sir . Any higher , Mr. Bond , my ears will pop . I don 't think I 'll ever fly with anyone else . You 're so right , Mr. Bond . - This is where we leave you , Mr. Bond . - A little premature , isn 't it ? Enjoy your flight . - Good morning , Moneypenny . - James . Why are you so late ? I fell out of an aeroplane without a parachute . - Who 's in there ? - Q and the Minister of Defense . - You don 't believe me , do you ? - You should go right in . Yes , Moneypenny . - 007 . At last . - Good morning , sir . - I think you know Frederick Gray . - Commander . - Minister . Q. - 007 . Moonraker ? - What do you know about it ? - What I read in the newspapers , sir . The shuttle was being flown over here on loan from the Americans on a 747 . Which crashed somewhere in the Yukon . Aircraft and shuttle destroyed . - That 's the official version . - The truth is rather more disturbing , 007 . Look at this . That 's the crash scene with wreckage everywhere . That 's the fuselage . We 've been through it thoroughly , but there 's no trace of Moonraker . - Was the shuttle hijacked in mid-air ? - That 's for you to find out , 007 . - It was built in California by Drax . - Yes . We were responsible for its safety , Commander . The US government is justifiably concerned . I can imagine . California must be the place to start . - I agree . - Don 't make any mistakes , 007 . This situation is critical . We 've got to find that shuttle . Yes , sir . - If that 's all , gentlemen ? - Just a minute , 007 . I 've got something for you . Roll up your right sleeve , will you ? This is now being issued as standard equipment . Strap it on your wrist . It 's activated by nerve impulses from the wrist muscles . Like this ? Oh , thank you , 007 . - Be careful , will you ? - Yes , Q. Five blue-tipped armor-piercing darts , five red-tipped cyanide-coated , causing death in 30 seconds . Very novel . You must get them in the stores for Christmas . Good morning , gentlemen . - Welcome to California , Mr. Bond . - I like it already . - My name is Corinne Dufour . - Are you going to show me around ? No , I 'm just a humble pilot for the Drax Corporation . This is the Drax estate now . Everything you see belongs to Mr. Drax . - He owns a lot . - What he doesn 't own , he doesn 't want . We 're approaching the main complex . - Where the Moonraker is made ? - That 's right . Workshops , hangars , design and experimental blocks , everything . Very impressive . I 'd heard Hugo Drax is obsessed with the conquest of space . Now I can believe it . Good Lord . The Drax residence . Every stone brought from France . - Cute , isn 't it ? - Magnificent . - Why didn 't he buy the Eiffel Tower too ? - He did , but was refused an export permit . Look there . Those are the astronaut trainees . Mr. Drax is financing the entire training program out of his own pocket . He seems to have an eye for a good investment . Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond in the drawing room , Miss Dufour . - Thank you , Cavendish . - This way , please , sir . Mr. Bond , sir . - Mr. Bond . - Mr. Drax . Allow me to present Countess Lubinski , and Lady Victoria Devon . Mr. Bond . How do you do ? Well , my dear fellow , your reputation precedes you , of course . I 'm honored that your government sent you on so delicate a mission . Delicate , Mr. Drax ? To apologize in person for the loss of my space shuttle . How would Oscar Wilde have put it ? To lose one aircraft may be regarded as a misfortune . To lose two seems like carelessness . An apology will be made to the American government , Mr. Drax , when we 've discovered why the Moonraker wasn 't in that wreckage . Your loyalty commands respect , Mr. Bond . You have arrived at a propitious moment . Your country 's one indisputable contribution to Western civilization . Afternoon tea . May I press you to a cucumber sandwich ? Thank you , no . Nothing at all . Is the shuttle made entirely here in California ? No , I own a number of subsidiaries worldwide , producing components . The conquest of space is an investment in the future of the entire human race . It is therefore logical to seek out the best that each nation has to offer . Are you referring to people or skills ? Both , Mr. Bond . - Am I too soon ? - Not at all . I 'm sure Mr. Bond is eager to start his tour . Miss Dufour will escort you to Dr. Goodhead who will show you around . Ask anything you like . - Thank you for being so cooperative . - A pleasure . Look after Mr. Bond . See that some harm comes to him . You 'll find Dr. Goodhead first on the right . - Thank you for the ride . - Call on me if you need anything . - Good afternoon . - Can I help you ? My name is Bond . James Bond . I 'm looking for Dr. Goodhead . You just found her . A woman . Your powers of observation do you credit , Mr. Bond . James , to my friends . Holly Goodhead . Are you training to be an astronaut ? I 'm fully trained , on loan from NASA . The space administration . I guess we 'd better get started . You don 't want to lose time as well as a space shuttle , do you ? This is the Moonraker . Capable of being launched into space by rocket ... And re-entering the atmosphere to land like any conventional aircraft . This is the centrifuge trainer . It simulates the gravity force you feel when shot into space . The speed is controlled by the instructor from up there . Why not try it ? Why not ? Strap yourself in firmly . Yes , Doctor . Now your arms . That 's to prevent you from knocking yourself out . I see . How fast does it go ? It can go up to 20 Gs , but that would be fatal . Three Gs is equivalent to takeoff pressure . Most people pass out at seven . You 'd make a great saleswoman . You don 't have to worry . This is what we call the " chicken switch " . The moment the pressure gets too much , release the button and the power 's cut off . - Just like that ? - Come on , Mr. Bond . A 70-year-old can take three Gs . Trouble is , there 's never a 70-year-old around when you need one . - Do you want me ? - Mr. Drax says to telephone him . All right , I 'll call him from my office . You go ahead . I 'll be right back . The instructor will supervise the session . Enjoy yourself . Yes , we 're taking good care of him . I don 't know what could have happened . Something must have gone wrong with the controls . Let me help you . My mother gave me a list of things not to do on a first date . Maybe you won 't need it . That 's not what I came for . No ? What do you want , then ? Would your feelings be shattered if I were to say " information " ? - Why should I tell you anything ? - Why indeed ? You presume a great deal , Mr. Bond . What goes on here besides Moonraker and the astronaut training program ? There are the laboratories , but not much is happening now . No ? They were working on something very secret , but everything 's been moved . Where to ? I don 't know . What about that list of your mother 's ? I never learnt to read . What are you doing ? You whetted my appetite for information . Is there a safe in here ? Thank you . James , no ! That 's amazing . There you are , you see . You have a heart of gold . 18-carat . - You must go . - You go first . I 'll turn off the lights . Thank you . - Take care of yourself . - And you . Ah , my dear Bond . This is Mademoiselle Deladier and la signorina del Mateo . - Ladies . - I 'll see you at lunch . A pity you leave us . Such good sport . - Unless you 're a pheasant . - Really , Mr. Bond . Take my gun . A stray bird may fly over . - I came to thank you for your hospitality . - There 's plenty of time before the airport . Come now . - I doubt if I 'm in your class . - Oh , you 're too modest , Mr. Bond . Over there . You missed , Mr. Bond . Did I ? As you said , such good sport . You called for me , Mr. Drax ? - You were with Bond last night . - No , I ... - You showed him the safe . - I didn 't . I 'm terminating your employment . You will leave immediately . Franco , I 'll call you where to meet me . - Could I interest you in something ? - I 'm tempted to say yes immediately . - But maybe I 'd better have a look around . - Please , go anywhere you wish . ... the glassworks was taken over by Drax Industries . And here we have some of the rarest examples of the glassblower 's art . As you know , everything was done absolutely by hand . Here is a vase done by Lorenzo Graziati some time between 1850 and 1860 . If you 'd like to follow me over here ... This exquisite bowl was fashioned about 1520 , over 450 years ago . If it ever came on the market it would certainly fetch in excess of $ 1 million . But if you were thinking of taking it ... Here we have a very early 17th century dish with an aquamarine medallion . Over here , we have something very , very interesting . This glass-handled sword , the only one of its kind in the world , was owned by General Menotti in the late 18th century and is the work of Bru ... 14th century . Dr. Goodhead . I can only hope your presence here is a coincidence . I dislike being spied on . Don 't we all ? - You 're staying at the Danieli ? - Yes . How did you know ? Well , I like to keep abreast of things . May I ask what you 're doing in Venice ? Addressing a seminar at the European Space Commission . My . Heady stuff . But I keep forgetting you are more than just a very beautiful woman . If you 're trying to be ingratiating , don 't bother . I have more important things on my mind . That 's what I 'd like to talk about . Dinner this evening ? This evening I 'm giving my address . Can you think of a reason for not having a drink afterwards ? Not immediately . But I 'm sure I shall . Franco . Play it again , Sam . - What the hell are you doing here ? - Convalescing . Your friend Chang just tried to kill me . - You think I had something to do with it ? - Well , the thought had crossed my mind . - What 's Drax up to in that laboratory ? - Why don 't you ask him yourself ? - You 're leaving me your phone number ? - I don 't see the point . Now I do . Not what I want to get stuck with tonight . James , why don 't you pour yourself a drink , huh ? Thank you . Daily diary . Fairly deadly diary . Bollinger . If it 's ' 69 , you were expecting me . A trifle overpowering , your scent . Standard CIA equipment - and the CIA placed you with Drax . Correct ? - Very astute of you , James . - Not really . I have friends in low places . Could this possibly be the moment for us to pool our resources ? It could have its compensations . Where are you planning on going from here ? I 'm not planning on going anywhere . I suppose you 're right , Holly . We would be better off working together . - Détente ? - Agreed . - Understanding ? - Possibly . - Cooperation ? - Maybe . - Trust ? - Out of the question . Send the night porter up for my bags , please . I hope you know what you 're doing . I 've played bridge with Drax . 007 doesn 't usually push the panic button unless it 's serious . I should hope not . I see you 've covered everything with our Italian friends . - Is this it ? - Yes , sir . - Gas masks ? - We can 't afford to take any chances . Frederick Gray . What a surprise . And in distinguished company , all wearing gas masks . Not being English , I sometimes find your sense of humor difficult to follow . On behalf of the British government , I apologize . I think you owe us an explanation , 007 . I 've never been so humiliated in my life . Your man should be taken off the assignment . I 'll see you at the consulate . I 'll have to do what he says . Before you do that , sir , have Q do an analysis of this . I took it from the laboratory . Tell him to exercise extreme caution . It is lethal . So there was a laboratory . You 'd better take two weeks leave of absence , 007 . - Any thoughts on where you might go ? - I 've always had a hankering to go to Rio . I think I can recall your mentioning it . 007 , no slip-ups or we 're both in trouble . Yes . A minor crisis has been averted . No , nothing serious , but all merchandise is to be rerouted as from today . Now , regarding a replacement for Chang . You have someone in mind ? Oh yes , well , if you can get him , of course . Flight BA128 to Rio de Janeiro now boarding at Gate 7 . Welcome to Rio , Mr. Bond . The President 's Suite . Really ? Well , don 't bother showing me the rest . If I get lost I 'll take a cab . - Do you come with the suite ? - It depends who 's renting it . Vodka martini , shaken not stirred . - Why were you following me ? - I was trying to meet you . I 'm Manuela . I work for Station VH . We have been asked to assist you . M thinks of everything . Tell me , do the initials C and W mean anything to you ? C and W ? Yes . Carlos and Wilmsberg . They are very big importers in Rio . A subsidiary of the Drax Group , I believe , with a warehouse on Carioca Avenue . - I 'd like to pay it a discreet visit tonight . - Tonight ? You may find that a little difficult . Difficult or not , it 's something we have to do . And meanwhile , how do you kill five hours in Rio if you don 't samba ? - There 's the warehouse . - And not a soul about . - I think there 's a way around the back . - Good thinking . This is it . Don 't talk to any strange men . I 'll be back . - Are you all right ? - Yes , but I 'd rather dance with you . I did tell you not to talk to any strange men . Did you find anything in there ? Only this . Drax Air Freight . - You know the airport they operate from ? - Yes , São Pedro . Shall I take you there ? No , I think you need some rest . Come on , I 'll drop you off . OK . - Haven 't we met before somewhere ? - The face is familiar . As is the manner . - It 's become chilly since Venice . - That was before you walked out on me . Nearly tripping over your suitcase on the way out . So ? So , why waste time working against each other ? I 've checked Drax 's warehouse in town . It 's empty . That 's no surprise . Those planes have been taking off every two hours . - Yes . He 's moving out . - Where to ? That 's what we 'll find out , now that we 're working together . I still don 't know if I trust you . I don 't know if I trust you either . That 's what makes it more exciting , doesn 't it ? What 's wrong ? I don 't know , but I 'm sure we 're better off out than in . Bring that chain . - Hang on , James . - The thought had occurred to me . - I might have guessed . - Do you know him ? Not socially . His name 's Jaws . He kills people . Give me the chain . Come on . Hang on to me . Jump . - Have you broken something ? - Only my tailor 's heart . - What was that for ? - For saving my life . Remind me to do it more often . Thank you , but we 're in great shape . Sorry about that . James . You look as though you 've fallen off a mountain . Well , it 's funny you should say that , Moneypenny . I was in a cable car and ... - Never mind . - The other courtyard . There you are , 007 . Balls , Q ? Bolas , 007 . - Good . Have that ready for army day . - Yes , sir . - Where 's M ? - He 's in the office over there . This way . - Good morning , 007 . - Good morning , sir . You 're just in time . Sit down . Sir . - Q 's come up with something . - Splendid . Any news of Dr. Goodhead ? 'Fraid not . Right , Q. It 's a breakdown on that phial of liquid you picked up in Venice . - You seem to be right , 007 . - Thank you . It 's a highly toxic nerve gas that appears to have no effect on animals . May I see the formula ? It 's a chemical formula of a plant . Orchidae nigra . A very rare orchid indeed . Thought to be extinct - until a missionary brought one back from the Amazoco . Actually , he brought it back from the River Tapirapé . Well done , James . You 'd better get up there , and fast . I 've got something to get him there . If 007 can be trusted to look after it . Mr. Bond , you defy all my attempts to plan an amusing death for you . You 're no sportsman . Why did you break off the encounter with my pet python ? I discovered he had a crush on me . Jaws ... Moonraker 1 on preset launch program minus two minutes . - Retract crew access arm . - CAA retracted . - Transfer orbital power . - Power transferred . - Activate hydraulics . - Hydraulics activated . - Activate auxiliary power unit . - APU activated . - LH2 replenish . - Replenish confirmed . - Pressurize helium tanks . - Helium flight pressure confirmed . What exactly are you up to here , Drax ? - And why the orchids ? - The curse of a civilization . Neither war nor pestilence wiped out the race who built the city around us . It was their reverence for this lovely flower . Because long-term exposure to its pollen caused sterility . Correct , Mr. Bond . As you have discovered , I have improved upon sterility . Those same seeds now yield death . Not to animals or plant life . One must preserve the balance of nature . Moonraker launch program commencing . Minus 20 seconds . - SRB profile . - Activated . - Cooling pumps . INU . - INU confirmed . Moonraker 1 , liftoff . We have liftoff . Moonraker 2 , T minus ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . - Main engine start . - Moonraker 2 , liftoff . - Moonraker 3 . - Moonraker 3 , liftoff . - Moonraker 2 , compile program . - Confirmed . - Moonraker 4 , preset program . - Moonraker 4 , liftoff . Moonraker 1 , SRB jettisoned ? - We have separation . - Moonraker 3 , confirm . Moonraker 5 on preset launch program minus 10 . Drax , one more thing . You delivered a shuttle to the US government , then you hijacked it . Why ? Because I needed it . One of my own Moonrakers developed a fault during assembly . Now you have distracted me enough . Jaws , Mr. Bond must be cold after his swim . Place him where he can be assured of warmth . Moonraker 2 , go for orbit . - SRB jettison . - Separation minus 5 . Moonraker 5 ready for launch . James ! Thank God you 're safe . Moonraker 5 , transfer orbital power . Hydraulics activated . - Activate auxiliary power unit . - APU activated . LH2 replenish . Even in death my munificence is boundless . When this rocket lifts off , I shall be leaving you in your own private crematorium . Mr. Bond , Dr. Goodhead , I bid you farewell . - EPS power on . - EPS power confirmed . Come on . The air vent . - External LO2 pressure . - Confirmed 21 psia . Moonraker 5 , preset . - External LH2 pressure . - Confirmed 42.5 psia . - Retract crew access arm . - CAA retracted . Get back , quick . T minus 10 seconds . Nine ... seven , six , five ... Bang on time . Come on , quick . Straight on . Moonraker 6 astrotechnicians , prepare to embark . I repeat , Moonraker 6 astrotechnicians , prepare to embark . - Moonraker 5 crew . - All systems go . Moonraker 6 , start launch sequence . PP confirmed . - Go for orbit . - Confirmed . We have separation . Moonraker 5 ground crew stand down . We 're going the wrong way . Moonraker 6 , preset launch program completed . Pilots proceed from base to launch area . Shuttle , go . Boosters , go . Launch pad , go . - External LO2 pressure . - Confirmed 21 psia . - External LH2 pressure . - Confirmed 42.5 psia . Moonraker 6 cleared for launch . T minus 10 seconds . Nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Go . It 's all right . We 're on a prearranged flight program . That 's Drax in Moonraker 5 . - What about the others ? - I don 't know . Let 's see . We 're on parallel courses , so we must be headed for a rendezvous in orbit . Let 's see what cargo we have . - The animals went in two by two . - What do you mean by that ? Noah 's Ark . This operation . We 're converging . - Control rockets ? - Yes , we 're slowing down . What 's that ? There 's no image on the radar scanner . An entire city in space . And still nothing on the radar scanner . So nobody on Earth knows it 's there . Right . Drax must have a radar-jamming system . All Moonrakers prepare to dock and continue radio silence . Moonraker 6 , you are now in manual . Initiate docking sequence . All shuttles now docked . Execute station activation procedure . Gravity , normal conditions . Life-support system , nominal . Moonraker 6 technicians , commence operational sequence . - Initiated . - Check airlock seals . ALS secure . All personnel to command satellite . All personnel to command satellite . All crews to M5 segment . Moonraker 6 technicians to M2 segment . Moonraker 1 and 3 to M1 segment . Moonraker 4 and 5 to M4 segment . Moonraker 2 to M5 segment . Units 4 and 7 , man console as planned . Units 1 , 3 , 5 and 6 , assume preassigned stations . - Pressure on line ? - Confirmed safe . - Life support ? - No . Those are the globes I saw in Venice with the nerve gas phials inside . First there was a dream . Now there is reality . Here in the untainted cradle of the heavens will be created a new super-race , a race of perfect physical specimens . You have been selected as its progenitors - like gods . Your offspring will return to Earth and shape it in their image . You have all served in humble capacities in my terrestrial empire . Your seed , like yourselves , will pay deference to the ultimate dynasty which I alone have created . From their first day on Earth they will be able to look up and know that there is law and order in the heavens . All units start Operation Orchid . If we were visible from Earth , they 'd investigate . Where do you suppose that radar-jamming system is ? We didn 't pass anything on the way here , so let 's try this way . Station 2 , check coordinates mode 4 . Initiate globe launch timing sequence . Orbital communicator , level 10 . Zero gravity . This is it . The radar-jamming system . Check . - Coordinate conversion program . - Check . - Side lobe gain . - Check . - Spectral response . - Check . - Spin stabilizer correction factor . - OK . Gigahertz reflector efficiency . Solar proton screen . Where did you learn to fight like that ? NASA ? No , Vassar . - Switched off ? - Permanently . Now Earth can spot us . - Doesn 't look good at all . - It 's over 200 meters in diameter . Yes . Yes . Please listen , General Gogol . We didn 't put it up there . Neither did we , Colonel Scott . So , what are you suggesting ? We 've taken action . We 're sending up a vehicle to intercept . Very well . But if we don 't hear from you in the next 12 hours , we 'll take action ourselves and hold you responsible for the consequences . We 'll be in touch , General . - Sorry to have woken you . - I was already awake . How can I sleep ? Nothing but problems . Problems , problems . Marine astronauts to launch pad . Launch pre-program complete , sir . Launch globe number one . TDRSS reports a launch , sir . Continental USA . Vandenberg . There are no launches scheduled . Check radar-jamming system . Well ? Jamming power supply and backup have failed , sir . - Investigate immediately . - Investigate number 28 . James Bond . You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season . - I didn 't think there were any in space . - As far as you 're concerned , only winter . And the treacherous Dr. Goodhead . Despite your efforts , my finely wrought dream approaches its fulfillment . Your dream , whatever sort of nightmare it is , hasn 't a chance , Drax . You think not ? We shall see . - Coming up to second launch position . - Launch globe number two . No doubt you have realized the splendor of my conception . First , a necklace of death about the Earth . 50 globes , each releasing its nerve gas over a designated area , each capable of killing 100 million people . And the human race as you know it will cease to exist . Then a rebirth , a new world . US spacecraft on course to intercept us . Activate laser . Prepare to destroy spacecraft . You see , my dear Bond , we 're well able to protect ourselves against all enemies . Allow me to introduce you to the airlock chamber . Observe , Mr. Bond , your route from this world to the next . Dr. Goodhead , your desire to be America 's first woman in space will soon be fulfilled . Leaving you on your flying stud farm , conceiving your new master race . If you like , yes . And anyone not measuring up to your physical standards will be exterminated . Certainly . Interesting . - Most interesting . - Jaws ... Expel them . Jaws ! You obey me . Expel them ! Hold them ! Sir , US spacecraft , three minutes to intercept . Stand by to laser it . - Initiate firing sequence . - Initiating . US spacecraft in laser range 25.5 and closing . Range 15 , range 10 ... Prepare to fire . Five , four , three , two , one . It stopped rotating . Open the cargo doors . Number one platoon , EVA . Let 's try docking . Take the first landing . - Intruders have docked at satellite 7 . - Double the guard at every entrance . Report intruders ' progress throughout the station . - Number 3 globe ready for launching , sir . - Proceed . Intruders attacking command module . - Don 't shoot . - Hold your fire . Corridor 5 penetrated . Intruders advancing on command satellite . Maintenance crew needed , section 3 . At least I shall have the pleasure of putting you out of my misery . Desolated , Mr. Bond . Heartbroken , Mr. Drax . Allow me . Take a giant step for mankind . - Where 's Drax ? - He had to fly . - How 's Scott doing ? - He put the globe launchers out of action . When the station breaks up , they 'll disintegrate and harm no one . - But the three that have gone ... - Those must be destroyed . Come on ! Colonel , get your men off . Your mission is completed . Round up your men . Get them back to the shuttle . Back to the shuttle , everybody , on the double . Moonraker 5 , that 's the answer . Its laser can track those globes and destroy them . The corridor 's blocked . They can 't get to us now . All right , let 's go . The release system 's jammed . Release the door lock . I 'll see if I can operate it manually . It 's jammed too . Well , here 's to us . Jaws , we can 't disengage . The release system is jammed . Can you help us ? We 're free . They 'll make it . It 's only 100 miles back . Let 's get a read-out on those globes . I have the three globes on the screen . We should have a visual in a minute . There it is . The laser 's on automatic . Code 945 set . One down , two to go . Number two straight ahead . - What is it ? - We 're skipping on the atmosphere . In range . We should see the last one soon . There it is . - It 's getting hot . - I 'm coming in steep to get the last globe . I can 't hold this course much longer . We 'll break up at 200,000 feet . A few seconds more . Automatic firing system negative . Must be the heat . Switching to manual . The controls aren 't responding . - The wings are beginning to glow . - Hold her steady . Steady . It 's entering Earth 's atmosphere . James , this is our last chance . Steady . Colonel Scott picked up two survivors . A tall man and a short blonde woman . Right . OK . Dr. Goodhead reported their position . They 're coming into range of our Pacific tracking ship . We 'll have audio-visual within minutes from on-board monitors . Houston calling Dr. Goodhead . Houston calling . Confirm your position . As this is the first joint venture between our two countries , I 'm patching it to the White House and Buckingham Palace . I 'm sure Her Majesty will be fascinated . - We have audio-visual . - At last . - 007 ... - My God , what 's Bond doing ? I think he 's attempting re-entry , sir . James ... I think it may be time to go home . Take me round the world one more time . Why not ?

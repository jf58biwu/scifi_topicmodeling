I don 't know what we 're gonna find . But getting there is the only way we 'll ever know . Keegan : There it is . Ohh ... Will you look at Vegas ? Is that 's it ? It always looked better at night .

Do you not think that was sensible to think ? the manager ? What happened to him ? he was very unlucky . He could not accept that it happened . Never . He would wake up in the morning and believe things were all right . Then remember . He had a heart attack . He died in about six months . and cars ... from a bicycle . but I don 't think you 'll need most of those clothes . We don 't have that kind of room . sorry . You have to forgive me .

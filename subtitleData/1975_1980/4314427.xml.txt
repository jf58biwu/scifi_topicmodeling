 ( Helena ) ' Moonbase Alpha status report , '342 days after leaving Earth orbit . ' Dr Helena Russell recording . We have just survived our second encounter with a space warp . We 've been catapulted six light years from our previous position . We 've had no casualties this time . Our population remains stable at 297 . However , one life support system was severely damaged . 'We have a survey Eagle reconnoitring a nearby planet 'in an attempt to locate titanium , 'needed to repair that life support system . ' Entering the atmosphere now , Commander . Thank you . Atmosphere breathable . ( Pilot ) ' We 're in close visual contact with the planet . ' ( Koenig ) ' Fraser , any signs of life ? ' No settlements , no life . 'Nothing , Commander , except volcanoes . ' Fraser , scan for mineral compositions . 'Scanner active . Stand by to log into main computer . ' Dr Russell ! Titanium ! Eagle One , return to base . 'Right , Commander . ' Picard , pinpoint the location of the titanium deposits . ( Computer beeping ) Magnify ! Fraser ! There 's a strange light coming ! ( Fraser ) ' Position ? ' ( Koenig ) ' It 's on your flight path . 'Get out of there ! ' - What is that ? - An energy weapon . Security alert ! All crews to position . 'Rescue Eagles , full alert ! Laser crews to position one-five . ' Evasive action , Fraser ! Evasive action ! 'Can 't shake it , Alpha . ' Come on , Fraser ! Come on ! Get it off your tail ! ( Fraser ) ' We 're trying ! We 're trying ! ' 'Do something , Alpha , for God 's sake ! ' Bill ... Bill ! 'Help us , Alpha ! Help us ! 'For God 's sake , help us , Alpha ! ' Medical crew , Command Centre . 'Laser battery one , active . ' 'Combat Eagle Five in position . Combat Eagle Six in position . ' There 's got to be life on that planet . There is no life sign on the surface . What about below it ? That planet is an environmental hell . No life as we know it could exist there . ( Man ) ' Commander Koenig ! ' You know who I am . Who are you ? 'I am Mentor of the planet Zycon . ' Why did you attack our ship ? We came in peace . 'You sent an armed ship to talk of peace ? ' 'That ship was a survey vessel . 'We had no way of knowing your planet was inhabited . ' Yes , a familiar argument , it has caused the death of millions of our people . Other outsiders have used it to attack before . Easy now , easy . Come on now , come on . 'Your pilots are safe , but their Eagle is beyond repair . ' He said they 're safe ! - ( Koenig ) ' Return my men ... ' - Annie , Bill 's alive ! 'Yes , Commander . ' You have my solemn pledge that no hostile action will be taken . 'I accept your pledge . ' So , let us arrange their return . Send another Eagle and I 'll instruct you where to land . No ... I 'm afraid that could cause further misunderstanding . I suggest we rendezvous , but in space . 'It seems you trust us as little as we trust you . ' In our past , we 've been betrayed , too . Let us meet in space , then . You say that you need minerals . Send along a scientific officer to discuss technical requirements and ... you shall have them . That 's very generous . Thank you . 'Incidentally , one pilot suffered minor injuries . 'Perhaps you could also send along a medical officer . ' It will be done . 'Good . I look forward to meeting you , Commander . ' ( Koenig ) Mentor . Alan , put Eagle Four on the pad ready for immediate lift-off . And , Alan ... equip it with additional booster units . Right . Booster units ? You 're in a hurry to get out there , aren 't you ? I may be in a hurry to get back . What do you think of these Alphans , Maya ? I like them , Father . They 're very attractive , quite unlike the others . They obviously come from a culture similar to our own , but ... they 're not so advanced , of course . Would I make a good Alphan , Father ? Stop it , Maya ! I teach you the priceless art of molecular transformation and see how you use it - for foolish games ! Father ! You only taught me because you knew I 'd master it myself . True ! You are clever , Maya , but we must find a better outlet for your gifts . I 'd help in your work . No , there is a great deal about the work I do - that you do not understand yet . - Father ... Not yet . Will the Alphans help you to restore our planet ? Yes , Maya . And now , my dear , run along . Come on . Prepare the Alphan pilots . Where do you think you 're going ? - Back to my station . - She needs to rest . You think you can handle it ? Please , doctor , I feel much better now . Well , maybe it is better to keep busy . - Don 't overdo it , all right ? - I won 't . - Are you all right ? - Yes , Commander . - We 'll bring him back . - Thank you . Good luck . They come , Maya . They are men of honour . We 're in position , John . Mentor , this is John Koenig . 'We 're at rendezvous point . ' My ship will join you shortly , Commander . ( Rising hum ) ( Computer beeping ) There it is . I want a full scan on that ship . Mentor , signal when you 're ready for link-up . I repeat , signal when you 're ready to dock . - Mentor ? - ' John ! 'There are no life forms on that ship ! 'Fraser , Torens , they 're not on it ! The ship is empty ! ' ( Rumbling ) ( Static on radio ) ( Koenig ) ' We 're picking up magnetic disturbance , Tony . ' - We 're losing altitude . - ' His ship is radiating energy . 'It 's like a magnet , he 's pulling you down . ' Full power ! Full power , Commander ! We 're still held ! Boosters , half thrust ! Three-quarter power ! She won 't take it ! She 'll break up ! Boosters , full power ! ( Engines roar ) We 're clear , Tony . Returning to base . ( Rising hum ) John ! That ship - it 's turning into a ball of light ! No response . It 's like a graveyard of spaceships . And we 're right in the middle of it . Eagle Four to Moonbase Alpha . Come in , Alpha . Do you read me ? Eagle Four to Moonbase ... - I can 't raise them . - Keep trying . 'Welcome to Zycon . 'Don 't be alarmed , Commander . ' I 'm never alarmed by a man of integrity . I see that you are angry , and I must admit you have cause , but , please , bear with me and you will understand . 'I 'll understand after I see my people ! ' I act in both our interests . He 's lying ! Don 't trust him ! Commander , we 're being am ... 'Please forgive the interruption . 'Your pilot is in a feverish state . ' Then I want to examine him ! 'You will , Doctor , in good time . 'Now , please , remain in your ship until we contact you . ' Let 's go . ( Koenig ) Let 's make for that cave . ( Rising hum ) Keep on scanning , Sandra . They 're down there somewhere . I know they are but I cannot get a reading . All we get is the planet surface . Our beam is bouncing off a scanner shield of some kind . We won 't read anything they don 't want us to read . Is she gonna be all right ? She will as long as she knows he is alive . I 'm worried she 's gonna crack up . Be patient with her , Tony . They 've only been married two months . Yeah . Ah , Maya ! Observe . An increase in Psyche 's power levels ! How ? One of the Alphan pilots has been in rapport with her . - This is the result . - He agreed ? - Yes . - No harmful side effects ? - None . - But that 's wonderful , Father ! Will the rest of them help us ? I 'm sure they will . They are intelligent people . Lew , titanium ? Yes , it is . A few more hunks like this is all we need . Diverse life forms . They must be from those spaceships out there . The way they ... move . The way they look . They 're all behaving in the same way . It must be some sort of brain damage . Now we know what Mentor meant by " Welcome . " ( Man screaming ) Torens ! He doesn 't know us . Torens ... - John ! - You OK ? ( Helena ) John ... ( Alan ) Are you OK ? ( Lew ) It was a forcefield . That charge was only set to stun . ( Lew ) Molecular transformation . We saw it in the spaceship and the balls of light . Here it is again . ( Mentor ) Surrender your weapons , Commander . There is an energy screen around this image . You cannot get through . Lew , how can we get past it ? His image is only a communications circuit . Laser energy might overload it . I warn you , any force will be turned against you . I think I can neutralise it . - Lew ! Wait ! - ( Helena screams ) ( Beeping ) Commander , to resist is foolish . Helena ! Very well . ( Rising hum ) ( Growls ) Did I startle you , Commander ? Wasn 't that the idea ? Oh , forgive me . I meant no harm . You Zycons are full of fun and games . Who are you ? Maya , Mentor 's daughter . His daughter ? - And just as tricky . - Oh , I 'm sorry ! I should have warned you about the forcefield . Of course . Where 's the rest of my party ? Why are you so unfriendly ? I 've been lied to , assaulted , seen my people brutalised , killed ! Shall I go on ? Obviously , you have not fully recovered . Mentor betrayed us ! - Viciously destroyed ... - My father would harm no one ! - Come . - ( Buzzing ) He wants to see you . Relax , Commander . Your friends are inside . Come in , Commander ! Not now , my dear . The Commander and I have vital business to discuss . He is very unhappy . I want to hear you explain . Don 't worry , he 'll understand . Psyche , Commander - a biological computer , created from the minds and bodies of those of our people who survived the disaster which overwhelmed us when nature ran wild . Mentor , where are my people ? Study Psyche first , Commander . Our destinies are linked , you know . We 'll determine our own destinies . This planet is a volcanic furnace , but through Psyche I shall transform it , change it back to the beautiful world it once was . A world fit enough for our civilisation to begin again . A beautiful dream . We 'll talk more about it after I see my people . Commander ... Psyche ... Psyche needs energy to complete its task . Energy that is only found in the minds of intelligent life forms . In other words , Commander , the machine ... needs your Alphans . Those creatures in the pits ... Torens ... You fed their minds into that machine ? ( Mentor ) There is no other energy source . I also need them to dig the metal for Psyche 's physical being . You expect me to submit my people to ... to this ... obscenity ? ! Your presence here in space has given me a chance , perhaps my only chance , to make my world live again . And regretfully you have no choice . You must submit . Oh , yes . Psyche has the power of molecular transformation , the power to transform matter into any form or shape I choose . Observe your lunar landscape . ( Alarm beeping ) 'Weapons Section . ' There 's a sudden energy charge in the research area . 'Send a unit to investigate . ' Yes , sir . Refuse what I ask and I shall reduce your moon to ashes . You 're right . We can 't fight you . Thank you for your co-operation . No , you 're not reading me . Go ahead - destroy the moon . Bring down violent death on your people ? - At least they 'll die quickly . - I have the power and the will . Destroy the moon and you defeat yourself . No moon , no Alphans . Do what I ask and you and your friends will be spared . A place will be found for you on the new Zycon . No . You , er , wish to know about the rest of your party ? In a few moments , their minds will be squeezed dry and Psyche shall have them . ( Rising hum ) There 's still time , Commander . Wait ! ( Hum fades ) Yes , Commander ? You win . ( Computer beeps ) Tony ! It 's coming from the planet ! Punch it up . John ! We 'd given you up ! Commander , what 's happening ? 'Tony , good news , we 've made contact with the people . 'There are huge subterranean areas which are habitable . 'What 's more , we have permission to settle . ' Evacuate Alpha as soon as possible . Evacuate ? ! - Ship our people down in relays . - He 's selling out ! It can 't be . No , Mentor 's done something to him . Just like that ? No study , no research ? Just pack up and go down ? Why aren 't we going ? Why is he resisting ? Well , it is unusual procedure . 'Directive Four . 'It empowers the Commander to act in a situation like this . ' You will do as ordered . The procedure is laid down . Signal when you are ready . Out . Thank you , Koenig . Commander ! Helena , I ... It was the only way out . You should be grateful . You owe him your lives . The price is too high . Our survival ! John , what about the people on Alpha ? What about them ? You could end up like those creatures in the caves , but not me ! John ... ? Computer is refusing access . I will need the security code . I know what Directive Four is . Well , at least somebody is happy . What is Directive Four ? It 's a coded signal . A clear instruction to destroy the place it originated from . Destroy the planet ? But they are still down there ! It 's mandatory . And you will carry it out ? ! Return to your position . ( Groans ) We 've got to warn Alpha ! There 's no way out . You mean we just do nothing ? We 're trapped in here . 'Robot Eagle ready to launch . ' Estimated time of arrival at attack position , 1520 . - Attack position ? - Maximum destructive power . 'When that Eagle hits Zycon there will be nothing left . ' - What are you doing ? ! - Obeying orders . Bill 's still down there ! So is the Commander and the rest of them . You 're going to destroy the planet ? - Directive Four cannot be ignored . - What is Directive Four ? Can 't we double-check ? Ask for clarification ? John wouldn 't give that order unless this base faced destruction ! - Launch Robot Eagle . - No ! No ! No , you can 't ! You can 't ! Bill ... ( Sobbing ) In ten minutes , it 'll be all over . ( Mentor ) Commander ? One of your transporter Eagles is on its way . Again , I want to assure you that you and your friends will not be harmed . Maya , if you would , scan that Eagle . ( Alarm beeping ) No life forms ! It is a robot device programmed to destroy Zycon . How primitive ! And how disgusting that the Commander should descend to such deception ! Don 't confront him yet . Let him think he has deceived us . I don 't have your tolerance . Now who is the betrayer , Commander ? Did you think that your childish trick would go undetected ? We live in hope . Sending a probe to destroy this planet ! You 're a self-sacrificing fool ! I 'm sorry . I just couldn 't take the chance of telling you . First , I shall destroy your Eagle . Then your moon , Commander . Mentor ... that way we both lose . Let 's negotiate . Negotiate ? With a liar ? You disgust me ! We welcome you as friends and you plot to kill us ! You expect us to stand by while Mentor destroys us ? My father is an honourable man . - Why does he want us ? - You know why ! To help transform this planet . Others helped us . - Yes , and what happened to them ? - They attained happiness . Rapport with Psyche benefits everyone . Maya , that machine destroys minds ! Is there no vile thing you won 't say against my father ? Go down to the caves and see for yourself . - Nobody can . They 're radioactive . - Who says ? Mentor ? There 's nobody down there . Maya , we 've been there ! Go and see what we 've seen . Mindless hulks , destroyed by your father ! - That 's not true ! - Go and see ! Then come back and let us out so we can stop him ! No ... ( Koenig ) Maya , please ! Go and see ! - You 're lying ! - Go and see ! - Go and see ! - You 're lying ! Weapons Section . ( Tony ) ' We might be attacked . Activate shields . ' Yes , sir . ( Mentor ) ' Commander . 'Koenig ! 'Alpha will be destroyed , piece by piece , 'and you caused it ! ' We 've got to make a deal . We can 't stop him unless we get out of here ! We 've got to break that forcefield ! - Maya ... - ' Commander ? ' ( Alarm beeping ) - What 's happening ? - ' They 're through our shields . ' - What was it ? - ' An energy bolt of enormous power ! ' Launch Eagles for full attack . 'I will , but I don 't think it 'll help . ' No , neither do I. Maya , release the forcefield . He 's gonna destroy 300 more people unless we stop him ! Promise that Mentor will not be harmed . I want to stop him , not harm him . ( Buzzing ) Alan , get to the Eagle . Prepare for lift-off . Helena , you and Fraser get Torens . Let 's go . Maya ! What are you doing ? No , Commander ! To release Psyche 's energy will destroy the whole planet ! No ! Stop it ! Stop it , Commander ! This is madness ! - Maya , you must stop him ! - I was in the pits ! ( Sobbing ) I saw what was down there ! I saw ! Torens ! ( Mentor ) Get her away , Commander ! - You said he wouldn 't be harmed ! - Take her ! - Mentor , come on ! - Get Maya away ! Take her away ! Save yourselves ! - Let 's get out of here ! - Save Maya ! Come with us , Father ! Leave Psyche ! Psyche made you do evil ! No ! Understand , Maya ! Please ! I wanted to do good , I wanted to restore our planet ! I didn 't want to hurt anyone ! Hold her , Koenig ! - Hold onto her ! - Maya ... Maya ! Take her away , Koenig ! Maya , you can 't help him ! We 've got to get out of here ! Maya ! ( Mentor ) Get her out , Commander ! ( Mentor screams ) Maya ! Come on . ( All ) Hurry ! Come on ! Hurry ! Go ! Get moving ! Fraser ! Raise Eagle Four . Eagle Four from Alpha . - ' Eagle Four . ' - Yeah , go ahead , Alpha . - ' Fraser ? ' - Yeah ? 'I 've got something for you . ' We 'll soon be back on Alpha . In time you 'll forget . It 's just hard to stop thinking about Picard and Torens . I know . ( Sobbing ) Maya ... Thank you for saving our lives . And losing mine . Hey ... You 'll have a new life with us . Your science is so far ahead of ours . There 's a place for you on Alpha . Everywhere but on Zycon , I 'll be an alien . We 're all aliens ... until we get to know one another .

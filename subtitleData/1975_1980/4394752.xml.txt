 ( SCREAMING ) Greg ! For God 's sake ! Greg ! Get off ! ( GUNSHOT ) This way . Quick . Through the door . ( GUNSHOT ) - Who are you ? - Wally 's the name . - You all right ? - I am . Charles ? No . It got me in the leg . It 's bright lights and noise that keeps them off . - Is it bad ? - I don 't know . Such filthy things . - It 's more repulsive than anything else . - You want to get to the Centre . - Get it attended to . - Centre ? Get it looked at or you 've had it . It 'll go rotten as soon as blink . Come on . This way . - Where 's the Centre ? - The Oval . - I 'll take you . - At Kennington ? Yeah , that 's right . They 'll fix you up . Now , tuck your trousers in . The rats get everywhere . WALLY : Where you from ? West Country . You must be out of your minds . What are you doing here ? Oh , we 're looking for someone . A girl called Ruth . We had directions . She was brought here by an Indian chap and a woman with blonde hair . - About five days ago ? - Yes , that 's right . - You 've seen her ? - Sure . I see everything . All the coming and going . - I hear she 's a doctor . - That 's right . Look , how far is it ? - Is that leg all right ? - Yeah , I think so . Let 's just get there . It 's quite a way . - What , along the tracks ? - Yeah . We can 't move in the streets , what with everything . And even if you could , there 's the rats . This doctor , is she a friend of yours ? Yes . - Put in a word for me , will you ? - Why ? What for ? We don 't see eye to eye . What with her being a doctor , and you having a bit of influence , like , they might listen to you . How you feeling ? - Who are they ? - You 'll find out , mate . - How many of you are there ? - There 's 500 of them and one of me . I 'm not suggesting we rush things but we can make a start . She 's only been here a week . She isn 't concerned with the preliminaries . Well , not in your department , perhaps , but the medicines and drugs have got to be catalogued . You 're right back in form , aren 't you , Doc ? Manny , it 's a lengthy job , the sooner we get started , the better . What , you think I don 't know that ? Barbara 's only back in circulation because of me . To my way of thinking , the ball 's in her court . - No , it 's in yours . - Mine ? Well , you do the planning . - You make the decisions . - Ah . I do my modest best . We 've got to decide on transportation . The present situation ... - There 's no coal for a start . - That leaves petrol or diesel oil . How much we got ? Well , going by rail , it 'll have to be diesel . ( CLICKING TONGUE ) Clever girl , our Barbara . Oh ! ( ALARM RINGING ) Now , keep in the light . We 're gonna cross the road . ( ALARM CONTINUES RINGING ) Who ? You 're joking . Right , I 'll let them in . - What are you doing here ? - I brought these two men . - Who are you ? - They 're friends of the doctor . - The woman ... - Who said so ? - They did . - Oh , did they ? I can vouch for them . Wally , you shouldn 't be here . - You are in big trouble . - I had to show them the way . All right , give me your gun . You can 't take them any further until you give me your gun . - Out ! - What ? - Out , Wally , quick . - Hey ! - You 're the one who came to Whitecross . - Yes , I 'm sorry ... - Yeah , well , where 's Ruth ? - She 'll be in her surgery . ( WALLY SHOUTING ) Get back across the road before we turn the lights off , Wally . - What 's he done ? - He 's a lot of trouble , that boy . - He can 't come in , we 've decided . - What kind of trouble ? Just trouble . He 's been put out to cool . Well , he just saved us from the rats back there . - It is not my decision . - Yeah , well whose ? So , you must be Greg and you 're Charles . Heard a lot about you . - My name 's Manny . - AMUL : He 's the boss . - Welcome to town . - Where 's Ruth ? In her surgery , I suppose . Oh , you remember Penny ? Oh , I expect they do . - Ruth tells me that you 're an architect . - Yes , I was . - And you 're an engineer . - That 's right . Well , that 's great . Great ! We 're short of talent . Yeah , well , you still are . Just as soon as Charles ' leg 's fixed up , we 're getting out of here . And we 're taking Ruth with us . - What 's wrong with his legs ? - Rat bites . Amul , get him to surgery . Don 't waste any time . Certainly . Oh , gentlemen . If you don 't mind , we don 't carry guns here . Amul will take them to the armoury . This way , please . I don 't like it , Manny . Oh , I think we might be in for a bit of trouble . - The sooner we get back , the better . - Don 't rush me . - How 's it feel ? - It hurts . They 're well equipped , got to say that for them . I suppose I 've been expecting you . You should have had more sense . - Ruth , you all right ? - Yes . I 'll leave you now . - What have you been up to , then ? - Slight altercation with a pack of rats . Well , take your trousers off and jump up here . I won 't pretend that I 'm not glad to see you but you were nuts to come after me . - What did you expect us to do ? - The vote was unanimous . Don 't think I 'm not grateful , it 's just that it may be some time before you get out of here again . Oh , we 're all getting out of here , just as soon as you finish with Charles . It 's not as easy as you think . You mean the rats ? We 've learned to cope with those the hard way . These are nasty . Rats are only part of the story . There 's a sickness here that 's just not in the textbooks and which makes it very dangerous for anyone to move away from this hospital . They call it the London Sickness and that 's what 's keeping people here . You mean that 's what keeps you here ? Ruth ? Ruth , you 're our hospital . I know there aren 't many of us but we need a doctor , too . Roll up your sleeve . Anti-tetanus . There are 500 people here . Five hundred people with a sickness rate of 10 % . ( MOANS ) RUTH : Don 't moan . Look , just a minute , there 's already a doctor here . I mean , that chap that brought us , Wally , he said there was one . Yes , that 's true . So what you 're really saying is that you want to stay . - I have no choice . - Oh , come on . - You 're not a prisoner . - I have to stay for the big move . The what ? Manny 's plan is to move us all to the Isle of Wight . Oh , great . And when 's that gonna happen ? It 'll have to be done in stages to get the amenities and the agriculture going , but it can 't be done unless we have a doctor and a hospital at either end . - Yes , but when ? - Soon as it can be organised . - Weeks , months , years ? - I don 't know . It 'll have to be years if it 's a question of working the land . It 'll have to be sooner than that . I don 't see how it can be , unless a start 's already been made . - And has it ? - No . I 'm not interested in any London Sickness , - big move to the Isle ... - Greg , listen . There was a radio engineer here who died five days ago . For 14 months he 's been sending messages out all over the world . Now , the only voice he picked up was from Cairo . There are 12 people there . Twelve . Here in London there are 500 at the moment . It 's been worked out , the Doctor has worked out , that with less than 500 people , the human species become extinct . It won 't take very long . The 500 people here in London is the lowest limit . - That 's anybody 's guess . - It 's been worked out . Now you know why I was brought here and why I can 't leave . - I was told your friends were here . - This is the Doctor . Greg and Charles . In the circumstances I won 't say " Welcome to London " . Forgive my not being here . You 're in good hands . Yes , I know . I feel I 've had more sleep this past week than in a year . We came to take her back . Yes , of course . - Has Ruth explained the situation ? - Yes . Then you 'll understand why we need her here . And you , too . - I 'll take my own time . - All right , Wal . - What 's gonna happen ? - I don 't know . - I don 't think it 's an execution . - Oh , really . - MANNY : Come in . - Go in , Wally . MANNY : Yeah , sure , I understand that . - Right now , how are we off for potatoes ? - Oh , we got masses of them . Oh , love , don 't tell we got masses . How much ? Well , we got about 480 sacks in store and we should have another 250 odd in a couple of months . Oh , it 's great . Right . Now , let 's get on to the tinned stuff . Beans ? Yeah , we got 60 cases . - Permission to sit , granted ... - Oh , cut it out . I 'll say this for you , Wally , you 're a brave man . Okay , George , ta . - They give you something to eat ? - The prisoner ate a hearty meal , sir . Who 's the prisoner ? Oh , come on , Wally , let 's have a little chat . I mean , let 's try and get somewhere . Yeah , why won 't you be reasonable , Wally ? That 's all we want . Nobody wants trouble . Hello , Doc , we 're ready for you . How 's your mate , Greg ? He 's been looked at . - Hello , Wally , you well ? - I 'm still alive . - Good . - Is this a court ? - No , no , it 's all informal . - Oh , well , that 's something . - Greg , do you know this chap Wally ? - Yeah , he brought us here . I saved his life . - MANNY : That so ? - Yeah . What 's he done ? My face doesn 't fit . Oh , come on , Wally , that 's just not true . All right , all right , all right . Greg , I 'll fill you in a detail or two . Wally here , nice lad , survivor like you and me , so what does he do while we all try and keep going ? - Can I say something ? - When I 've had my say , Wally boy . I didn 't come through all this to live in a fascist state . Oh , Wally , how old are you ? 24 , 25 ? What do you know about fascist states ? I 've been around long enough to know which way things are going here . Greg , listen . Everything here is discussed , then agreed . That 's never been good enough for him . He 's got to go his own way . So there 's always bother . Things that should get done , don 't get done . Yeah , that 's the trouble . So we had a big democratic election , him or me . And what do you think ? It was damn near 500 for me and five for him . So we asked him to behave . And what did you say ? Not under fascism . ( MIMICKING ) Not under fascism . So we told him he could make all the decisions he wanted to , on his own , out there in the country . - But you didn 't go . - You know I can 't live out there . - People do . - Not from London . Wally , you want to come back in again , don 't you ? - Well ? - Yeah . - Greg , would you trust him ? - WALLY : With what ? We need a messenger to go back to Greg 's settlement and tell them what 's happened . Now , if you 're given directions and you 're sensible and keep away from anyone out there , you can do an important job , Wally . - I 've said that I 'd rather go myself . - I know , Greg . Yeah , we all know . But we need you here , you 're an expert . I see , I get it . Dangerous mission . If anything happens , like getting sick , you won 't miss me but you 'll miss him , right ? If you wanna put it that way Wally , right . If I do go and I get back alive , will you let me in ? Yeah , yeah , it 'll prove you 're behaving yourself , won 't it ? - Will he let me in ? No , you wouldn 't . - If you ... I give you my word . I 'll go if he lets me in . He will . I wanna hear it from him . GREG : Manny keeps a nice hotel . The cook came from The Dorchester . He was a waiter but he had ambitions . Well , there are one or two compensations . - You still think I 'm mad ? - No . Not exactly raving . Trifle gullible , perhaps . Look , if the Doctor says it takes 500 people to maintain our species , then I 'm not gonna argue with him , but what I do disagree with is the fact that we seem to be caught in a situation that has no options . Why is there no panic about the disease catching up with medicine ? - Don 't the people here know about it ? - They don 't want to know . So they put all their faith in the hospital . It 's a dicey business , they could panic . That 's why it 's important to have strong leadership . - Like Manny ? - No , the Doctor . I 've been through all this before . I 'm not interested in saving the human species , all I want to save are my family and my friends . What happens when your baby grows up and has children ? I don 't know , but there 'll be something . Rather the Doctor 's point , isn 't it ? - How long ago did Abby leave ? - Six , seven weeks . And she didn 't make it ? - Would she have come back to us ? - Not necessarily . - She didn 't say where she was going . - No , she 'd have come back . I 'll give you this dose to see you on your way . Take a capsule every four hours and you 'll be back tomorrow . I 've given you two days ' worth but you 'll not be needing it , will you , son ? - Not if I get back . - You see and get back . So capsules , soap , and don 't forget to boil any water you drink . All right , I 'm not stupid . I don 't think you 're stupid , son , but we don 't want to lose you . He does . No he doesn 't . You 're a great nuisance , son , but that 's no reason to condemn you to death . Is it , dear Emmanuel ? Now , away you go and get your instructions from these folk . And see me tomorrow as soon as you get back , and we 'll all be friends . If I get back tomorrow night , will you let me back in ? Sure . The idea might have been to send him off with a wee bit of confidence . Why ? I don 't want to see him again . But you 'll let him in if he does get back . - I 'll think about it . - He 's one of the 500 , Manny . He 's not just trouble , Nessie , he 's dangerous . He 's had a bad week down there , give him a chance . And stop the Napoleon act . Napoleon ? You 're more hungry for power than I am and you know it . Manny . God forbid you should ever fall ill , Manny . - You sure you 're all right ? - Yeah , I 'll see you tonight . 122 male , 144 female fit and well , 89 children under 15 , 69 old people , 51 invalids . So , one hospital train , one train for everybody else who 's fit , and one for the gear . That better than , say , how many , 50 buses ? Buses and lorries , yes . Greg Preston 's looking to see if there 's a way through to the M3 . Jim Foster and Ken Willis can drive bulldozers . Otherwise it 's Clapham Junction and Charles Warne is doing a rail survey . - Right ... - Let me finish . - The real problem is the advance party . - It always was . Well , they must have fast access back here to the hospital - if anything should go wrong . - So ? Well , do we establish a first aid post at Sunbury ? No , we couldn 't start it . We need to make a fast clearway from here to say , Ryde or Cowes . Have we anyone who can pilot a hovercraft ? Tony Maxwell and Greg , he could have a go . - You weren 't sure of him . - If he comes back and makes sense . Could he take a party down , about 40 ? No way . He goes ahead of the advance party . - Ahead ? - Yeah , to have a go at the rats . Remember that stuff we used on the rats in the old days ? Oh , you mean yellow phosphorus , red squill . Yeah , well , Benji 's come up with some . He found a load of it in a warehouse down Wandsworth way . Now , what I thought was , we put Greg in a truck or a lorry with a couple of other lads , - Wally for instance ... - Hmm . ... load it up with the red squill , operation rat , Isle of Wight here we come . ( PHONE RINGING ) Then we send in the advance party . Yes , yes , he is . Do you want ... All right , I 'll tell him . - An emergency . - Right . That 's Hyde Street down there . On the pavement . Coaches won 't go on pavements . It 'll take a bulldozer all day just to clear this little lot . AMUL : Hello , Centre . Over . Hello , Centre , are you there ? Hello , Centre , you lazy slob , wake up . PENNY : Hello , yeah . Hello , Penny , we 're turning back now . We 're going to try for ... Where ? - Across to Kingston . - Across to Kingston . No , don 't do that . The railways are checking out okay . So you come back home . Over . Okay . How do you turn this thing off , then ? Oh . She found it . If we only knew when it 's all going to end . Oh , come on . Things aren 't nearly as bad now as when I arrived . And there haven 't been any new cases of the sickness . I know . But how well do you know your epidemiology ? Not very well . Well , epidemics were my business , really . I want to keep up morale , Ruth , but you and I have got to face facts . There 's no ignoring this . All right , so we 've had no new cases for a week , but we mustn 't let it delay the move . What we 've got to do is ... Ruth ... - Ruth , help me . - Doctor . Nessie . - MANNY : So far did you get , Charles ? - Nearly to Woking . The line looks sound enough . It could be clear all the way to Southampton . So all we have to do is to open up a path between here and Clapham Junction . - You 've got the bulldozers . - Could be difficult . Tony says the storage tank 's right down , so this oil train is the last . Yeah , well , tomorrow I 'll look for another storage tank . Down river , I suppose . It 's encouraging there have been no more cases of London Sickness in a week . Yeah , great , great . Hey , where 's Ruth ? Come to that , where 's all the medicos ? But you 'll still want to get out of London by the summer . - Well ... - I thought that was the idea . It 's got to be done properly , Greg . It needs planning , careful planning . Right , Barbara ? - Yes . - Yeah , well , I happen to be in a hurry . - Are you ? - Me , too , and Ruth . If Greg 's to precede the advance party ... If I 'm what ? All in good time , Greg boy , all in good time . We 're here , let 's hear it . The sooner the rat problem is settled , the better . We 're not hampered by having to establish lines of communication . Right . They just get in there with the old red squill . Hey , that should be right up your street , Greg . - What are you talking about ? - Wally 's here . Do you want to see him ? - Yes . - MANNY : Yes . In you go . - Did you make it ? - Sure . - And they 're all right ? - Yeah . Great place you got there . - You kept your distance ? - Yeah . I told them you 'd be staying here for a while and that 's fine . - They 're coping all right . - Come on , come on , let 's all hear it . They wanted to give me things for you but I said better not . Yeah , quite right . Pet says stay away from the girls . Me ? And Jenny says the baby ' s fine . And this guy Hubert , said to tell Ruth that he cured Daisy 's sore tits by rubbing them with Ruth 's carbolic . - What ! - What ? Oh , Daisy 's one of our cows . ( ALL LAUGHING ) Well , come on , let 's have some supper . - Wally , I 'm very grateful to you . - Yeah , thanks . All right . Well , it 's up to you now , son . Go and clean up . I 'll come back for the leftovers . Wally , ta . What 's he trying to say ? You 've known him longer than I have . Don 't know . The man had a dream and I was part of it . But I don 't claim to know him . Not well . - You 're the doctor . - No . Yes , Ruth , yes . He 's dying . What 's he trying to say ? He 's gone . Come on , you lot , supper time . Get out . Go on , get out ! Okay , Manny . You 're on . Londoners , this is Manny . I 'm sorry it 's bad news , it 's sad news . I don 't know how to give it to you , so I 'm gonna give it to you straight . The Doc 's gone . He died a few minutes ago . Now , this is a great loss . The Doc was a great man . He was a man of courage , vision and foresight . He had vision to see that he couldn 't go on much longer working so hard for us the way that he did . So what did this great man do ? He found a replacement doctor for us . From now on , his place will be taken by Dr Ruth . Hope it won 't be long before you all get the chance to meet her , but ... But don 't get me wrong , not as patients . When you do meet her , you 'll see for yourself that she 's determined to carry on the old Doc 's work . So that , in time , we 'll be able to make the big move . Well , that 's about it . Good night . In time ? There 's a lot dear Emmanuel hides from people . There he is ... my friend . He kept me going ... all of us . He gave his life to give us tomorrow . In time ? You said , " In time , the big move . " Well , it stands to reason , doesn 't it ? I mean , it 's bound to take a bit longer now . Will you do the rounds or will I ? - No , I 'll go . - I 'll go with you . Hold on a wee minute , Manny . Look , we 've all got to eat , haven 't we ? I don 't think any of us is hungry . I 'm going to turn in . - This leg . - How 's it feeling ? It 's no better . You better get Ruth to have another look at it . Yes . I want to have a few words with Manny . Yes , good idea . Well , I don 't know about anybody else , but I 'm starving . - Will you stop talking about food ? - Oh . Well , I 've got work to do . Good night . - Good night . - Good night . Nothing has changed , Nessie . The Doc always said it was a two or three year job . Latterly he didn 't . There 's only one thing that 's not changed and that 's you , Emmanuel . You don 't want to move . You never did . Big frog in a wee pond , that 's you . I don 't know why I put up with you . Perhaps because you know I 'm indispensable . Look , we 'll make the move as soon as it 's feasible , all right ? As soon as everything is properly planned . Then we 'll do it . You pea brain . What we can do now , the first thing , is to send a couple of lads on with that red squill Benji found . Greg and Charles , they 're itching to get home . Give them something positive to do , keep them out of mischief . Ruth and I can make the move . I thought we needed a doctor at either end . - Not really . - Well , why didn 't you say so before ? - There was always you and the Doc . - He was too old and too tired . - Yeah , well , you 're no chicken . - I 'll see you out . No , I can 't take a chance . He was . Look , you watch it , Nessie . With Ruth training a couple of kids , the time 's not far off when you won 't be all that indispensable . So , you watch it , Mother McCree . We 're back where we were , in a year 's time . - A year ? - Year and a half 's time . Two and a half year 's time . Look , we 'll do it properly . And how long is that gonna give Ruth , working under the same pressure as the Doctor ? - Come on , Greg , she 's a strong girl . - Well , wasn 't the Doc a strong man ? He had a year of it , the first year . All the load of them , we had a bad time . And in two and a half years ' time , what 's the population gonna be then ? Ah , there 's 14 babies on the way that we know of . - Fifteen . - Fifteen ! You know , Manny , for a so-called democratic man you 're really wedded to your own opinions . Oh , come on , Penny , you tell him . Look , Greg , Manny 's always been open to persuasion . That 's why he and the Doctor got on so well . I say we 'd be stupid not to get out of London just as soon as we can . - You just want to get home , don 't you ? - Of course I do ! The folk here don 't want to leave London , not to go off into the wilds . They want it all set up properly , they want a good life ... They need more medical attention than Ruth can give them . - Well , do you agree ? - Well , yeah , I suppose so , in a way . Well , he won 't agree till she drops dead . What do you take me for ? Oh , come in , Wally . Come and sit down and pile in . I hope that little trip of yours has given you an appetite . Greg here is right off his grub . Look , Charles worked it out that the survival rate after the Death - was about one in 5,000 . - Yeah , that 's what Barbara reckons . Okay , well , if that 's right , there ought to be - another five or six doctors somewhere . - Yeah , well , so ? Well , why don 't you try and find one of them ? Why don 't you send out Wally , say , and a couple of others with him ? Give them food , fuel , medical supplies , we just send him out and see if they can find one . That 's why we came to your farm , Greg . For the same reasons you are suggesting now . Wally and who else ? You , for instance ? Yes , if you like . Yeah , well , I got something more immediate planned for you two , - but sure , we can talk about it . - Oh , good . - Well , that 's a start . - We got to clear that way to Clapham . Well , can 't we do the two things at the same time ? Yeah , sure , sure . If , when I 've thought about it , it still seems like a good idea . - When Manny 's thought about it . - You watch it , Wally ! Look , Greg , you know as well as I do , there 's got to be one chain of command here . - Yeah , I know . - I 'm at the top ! Yeah , that 's right . - Is that a warning ? - You can take it how you like . One chain of command or the whole thing collapses ! And by the whole thing , I 'm talking about human beings . - This community . - I know that . - I 'm not challenging you . - Good . Then we 're mates . Medical supplies , he 's gonna hop it home . Now , Manny , you be careful . Nessie , this is Manny . Something 's come up , I 've got to tighten up on security . Now , listen . Don 't give out any medical supplies . No , no , not to anyone ! No ! Not until I say different . Right . - What you got picked out for me , then ? - Pardon ? You said you got something picked out for him and me . Oh , yeah , yeah , we 're ... We 're going off on a little jaunt , you and me . - Jaunt ? - Yeah . Tomorrow , you , me and George . - What for ? - Petrol , son . We 're going to look for another storage tank . Manny thinks of me and Greg as mischief-makers . - Oh , that 's not true , it 's absurd . - You tell him that . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) - Come in . - We 're getting out of here . - What ? - The three of us . That 's fine , because them is my sentiments . I 've just left Manny . He 's got no intention of getting out of London . It 's all an act . Well , there you are . I told you I heard him telling Nessie . - Well , what are we waiting for ? - Ruth ! She 's not sure . GREG : What , about Manny ? Come on , he 's power mad . He 's not bothered about staying alive . All he 's concerned with is status . There are 500 people here who need a doctor . Over 50 of them sick at this moment . - All right , they 've got Nessie . - Nessie 's not a doctor . - Neither are you for that matter . - Oh , Greg . Look , there are people you know who need you . Most of the people here , you 've never even met . That 's what makes me a doctor , not the qualifications . - You were brought here by force . - Yes . Well , you can be taken back by force . You and who else ? Me . - There 's no future for these people . - You can 't say that . Once we get to the Isle of Wight , we 'll have room and fresh air ... Ruth , they will never get out of London . Now , I 've heard Manny . He 'll come up with another reason , another excuse , another justification . He 's planning the move in two years ' time . He 'd be happier if it were five . What about the others ? They have some say . Manny 's not interested in what they 've got to say . Have you tried arguing with him ? All right , Wally boy ! Off you go . What do you mean ? Off where ? We 're looking for petrol , aren 't we ? Try over there . - There 's nothing over there . - How do you know ? Seek and you shall find , Wally boy . Well , go on , shoo . Wally ! Without the bike . - Here , hang about ? - Sorry , I need the bike . Well , come on ! I can 't wait all day . ( SQUEAKING ) - Three more cases . - This one 's the worst . What are we going to do ? Come and sit down . You 're tired and I 'm tired . She 's dying . Dying is the most natural thing in the world . - We can only do what we can . - No . Ruth , the only reason I wanted to become a nurse was to get away from home . So I stuck in . I was a shillpit wee thing so there were no great queue of handsome , young doctors after me , except as a bet . I stayed on and I finished up a matron . I got the MBE three years ago . I think it 's about time I tried to earn it . What are you trying to say ? I feel now I 'm old enough and , kind of , placid enough to have a go . You 've got to leave here , dearie . Charles was telling me about that settlement of yours . - Sounds a grand place . - It is . Listen , I 've seen you pepping yourself up , keeping yourself going . Why not you and me swap places ? I 'll manage . - You saying I 'm no good ? - No . But I 'd say you 're too involved . And the top one here has to be strong enough to deal with our Emmanuel . You can do nothing for the people here , for all your dedication . You 're wiser than me . At least I can comfort them . There 's a bag over there . I 've given you a whole load . Should last you some time . A good long time . - London calling . Hello . - Where 's Manny ? He 's gone out looking for petrol . That 's fine ' cause we 're taking some . - You 're what ? - We 're leaving . - PENNY : Oh , really ? - Yeah . And we 'll use these if we have to . - I can 't very well stop you , can I ? - I want petrol for that Range Rover . Only enough to get us back where we came from . Yeah , okay , fine . - All right , I 'll write a chit , shall I ? - That 's very kind of you . - Amul , you can give me a hand with this . - What ? Take this over to Benji and tell him that Manny authorised it . Okay ? - Okay , if you 're sure . - Yeah . Sure I 'm sure . Well , good luck . You know where to find us should you miss the lights of London . Good luck to you , too . Centre to Manny . Centre to Manny . Over . - MANNY : What do you want ? - I got some good news for you . We 're leaving . Now . - And we 'll carry you if necessary . - No need . - No , that 's wrong . Ruth can 't go . - What ? - These are not my orders . - What orders ? Well , well , well . - Now , what do we do with him ? - Take him with us . Just one wrong word out of you . Get us out of here . Shh ! ( MEN CHATTERING IN DISTANCE ) Too many . Come on , give me a hand . We can 't afford people like Wally here . - He 's too much involved . - Yeah , I suppose so . - Why do you think Penny wants us in ? - I 'll tell you one thing . We haven 't won the pools ! ( CHUCKLING ) That 's for sure . Come on . - Oh , Manny . - What 's the good news , love ? - Which way did you come in ? - Through Bank . - Oh , you must have passed them , then . - Who ? - Greg and Charles . - Where are they off to , then ? - Home . - Did you let them ? I couldn 't very well stop them , could I ? They had a couple of guns . - Ah , that 's a good reason . - Here , I thought you 'd be pleased . - Eh ? - To get rid of them . Yeah , saves me the trouble . Which way did they go ? Same way they come . I gave them ten gallons of petrol . You didn 't have to overdo it . Look , Manny , we got worse troubles than them . We got three more cases of London Sickness . Three ? What are we going to do ? Oh , Ruth will think of something . Nessie , where 's Ruth ? - Sick leave . - She 's not one of the three ? If you 're looking for Ruth , she 's gone . Gone ? You know , Emmanuel , speaking as your senior medical officer , I don 't think you 're looking very well . Come on , you 'll need that ! Ten gallons of petrol . Ruth 's with them . Are your glands up ? - No . - You 'll be all right . I 'll give you something to kill the pain . Just down by the others . Take those . RUTH : Sorry , no water I 'm afraid . Cheers . Sorry , friends , I don 't think this is a very good idea ! And don 't think I 'm not prepared to use this ! Get down on the track , quickly . Manny , you 've hit Benji . I tell you , you 've shot Benji ! What 's he doing there anyway ? GREG : Are you out of your mind ? You 're not leaving here ! GREG : Well , how are you going to stop us ? Manny ! Shut up ! What happens when you hit Ruth ? All right . Ruth , you stay . The others can go . No ! Well then , nobody goes ! The choice is up to you . He 's mad . There 's no use talking . Manny , I don 't want any of this . Let them go . If I let Ruth go , we 've all had it . - She doesn 't want to stay . - But she 's got to stay . I give the orders . What good will it do ? It 'll do me good . Why don 't you join them ? See how far that 'll get you . George , come back ! Don 't , no , don 't . Get round to the back of the truck and see if you can pull it . Give me that . MANNY : Listen you lot , you 're crazy ! How far do you think you 'll get ? It 's not good . It won 't move . - Have you got the gun ? - Yes . - See if you can hit that lamp . - Right . It 's no good . It 's too far away , I need my shotgun . Well , I 'm coming down . Give me some cover . RUTH : Done it . GREG : Just keep the momentum going . It 's downhill now to the river . Oh , great . - That 's all we need . - It 's the points . - I 'll take a look . - Don 't take too long . We can 't wait here . Right , we 're better off on foot anyway . This will only slow us up . Could you get up on the truck ? - I 'll start on these engines . - Lift me up , then . - Drugs and petrol . - Aye . These are all electric . There 's no sign of a lever . Come and give us a hand . It 's no good unless I can find the junction box . - Keep an eye on the rear , will you ? - What ? For Manny . You can tell Greg that all the switching is done upstairs . Watch it ! All right , Greg , come over here and start pushing . We 're going back . Ruth , you 're staying with us . So you better get used to the idea . Now , come on ! - You stay where you are , Greg . - What ? I can count if you can 't . You 've only got one round left in that gun . So you take your choice , Manny . Heads , we win . Tails , you lose . Only one round , Charles ? And there 's four more . This is George 's gun . All right now , come on and drop your guns . Otherwise she gets it . You 're bluffing . Of course . Come on ! ( GUN FIRES ) Who 's there ? Who is it ? Wally ? Yeah . - Is he dead ? - RUTH : Yes . - It 's what he tried to do to me . - Are you hurt ? Got a knock on the head . I 'll be all right . We 're going home . Why don 't you come with us ? - Yes . - No , thanks . Not my scene . - Is Nessie all right ? - Fighting fit . I got a job to do . Gonna find one of those doctors , help the old girl out . If I come your way , I 'll give you a hand . Look .

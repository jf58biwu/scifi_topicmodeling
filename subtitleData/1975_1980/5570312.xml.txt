 'Moonbase Alpha status report , '2,515 days since leaving Earth 's orbit . Dr Helena Russell recording . 'Commander Koenig has not responded to treatment 'since becoming irrational and crashing his Eagle . 'It is possible that the use of the cerebral wave machine 'has worsened his condition . 'He reacted psychotically to the arrival of a rescue party from Earth 'and remains convinced that it 's appearance is sinister 'and that evil forces are at work . ' - John , darling . - Stay away from me ! John , this is my brother Guido . Tony ... Alan ... Maya , what 's the matter with YOU ? ! 'He refuses to believe they are friends from Earth 'and insists that they are monsters determined to kill him 'because he 's the only one who stands in their way . ' Why won 't you listen to me ? You 're all blind ! 'The Commander remains in the Medical Centre 'where my old teacher , Dr Shaw , 'has promised to check on his condition . 'I feel helpless and frustrated because I can 't free John 'of the delusion that there is a plot to kill him . ' No ! Dr Shaw , what 's your opinion ? His vital signs are very erratic . This could be causing his mental instability . - If there 's anything more I can do . - I 'll ask , thank you . All right , Maya , let 's see if he 'll respond . John ... John ? John , Maya 's here . She has something to show you . It 's a recording . That 's the pilot ship . That 's an Eagle . ( Ehrlich ) ' I can see Earth . 'It 's blue and beautiful and we 're getting closer by the minute . ' They 're in an Eagle . Why can 't you accept what we all tell you ? Maya , what do you see out there in the Command Centre ? People from Earth . Oh , I was hoping ... I thought your different brain structure would have resisted their telepathic control . Whose telepathic control ? Maya , when you look , you see people from Earth . When I look ... I see monsters from a different dimension . One of us is wrong . Will you accept that it could be you ? Well , that would mean , of course , that everyone else is wrong . I 'm the only one on this base who is hooked up to that machine . Either the machine has distorted your consciousness ... Or protected it . Telepathic control ... 'It 's ... possible . 'I find it odd that everyone from Earth is somebody 's friend . 'It 's against probability . ' ( Koenig ) ' That 's because everyone is out of someone 's memory . ' ( Maya ) ' Yes , they could have tapped everyone 's mind 'and projected what they needed out of what they found there . ' 'It couldn 't project strangers as they can 't be in our memories . ' Wait , Maya sees these people , too , and they can 't be in her memory . It is possible that they could project images from other people 's minds into my mind . If they have control over our minds , why are they letting us have this conversation ? Perhaps it 's for a purpose . Maybe they have to be present to control . ( Helena ) ' Ben did say that he knew Sandstrom was trying to kill you 'but he couldn 't do anything about it . 'When Alan took Louisa away from him , he regained control of himself . ' ( Maya ) ' And in the records lab - Kander - they took him over ... 'controlled his mind . 'He must have made a discovery which threatened them . 'He didn 't go berserk - they made him release the oxygen 'causing the explosion which killed him . 'If only we knew what it was that he 'd found out . ' We 've been in space for months , in Earth time that 's generations . If they are from Earth , they 'd be hundreds of years older than us . That should have occurred to me . But they wouldn 't let it . They haven 't been able to control my mind because ... I was hooked to that machine . There may be no causal effect but ... it is a tenable theory . Helena ... please , unstrap me . Do we tell Tony ? No . Our best weapon is surprise . If we tell Tony , they may probe his mind and take away the one advantage we 've got . Maya , would you let Helena give you the same treatment I had ? - The brain complex ? - Yes . I don 't know if she can stand that . I 'm willing . If the Commander 's right ... It should be me , not Maya . But you can handle the machine , we can 't . Helena , if I 'm right , there are things Maya can do that you can 't . You little beauty ! What 's the first thing you 're gonna do , Joe ? Find a golf course where I don 't hit a mile . You ? Me ? Her name 's Jeannie . How about you , Jack ? Her name 's Caroline . She 's five years old . She 's got her mother 's eyes . ( Ehrlich ) 'San , what would you and Peter like 'as a wedding present from Earth ? ' Just to be there . ( Carter ) ' Look at that weather pattern ! It 's snowing in California . ' Hey ! Smile when you say that , man . Maya ? Maya ? How do you feel ? - Normal . - Wait a minute . Well , here we go on the carousel . ( Carter ) Earth Control , this is Swift Pilot Ship 2 . Do you read me ? Do you want me to fly this crate in ? 'This is New York Control reading you loud and clear . 'You 're locked into the computer , you don 't have to do a thing . 'Just sit back and enjoy the ride . ' I hear you , Oh , Earthman ! Alan Carter to Moonbase Alpha . 'We 're now going into Earth orbit then on down for a landing . ' Well ? Ticking over like a flawless machine , as always . Good . ( Koenig ) Helena . What do you see out there ? Dr Shaw and San 's fiance Peter . Maya ? Oh ! They look like the plasma that forms on some organic matter when it begins to decompose . Boy ! Don 't they look beautiful ? ! You got your historic lines ready ? How about , " It 's a small step for ... - It 's been done . - Who said it had to be original ? What are you going to say , Alan ? Where is the nearest john ? That will make the history books ! 'This is New York Control . We have you on automatic pilot . 'You 're about to touch down in New York . ' ( Carter ) Let 's get this luggage into the hotel . ( Bartlett ) I hope we get a room with a view . ( Ehrlich ) Forget the view , I want to get to a telephone . ( Carter ) In the old days , they used to call this town the Big Apple . Everything going according to plan ? Yes , one of them will stay here to prime the domes . I 'll send the other two for the nuclear trigger . - What do they want ? - There 's one way to find out . Oh , I think I know ! I really hate to ask you , Maya , but ... Oh , they 're so ... repulsive . If there was any other way ... ( Koenig ) Maya , remember , they know you 're a Metamorph , so be careful . We haven 't much time . We 're beginning to lose energy rapidly . Two aliens have been dispatched for the nuclear trigger . Once they energise it , we will take our fill . All the alien creatures will die . They are of no consequence , they are so ugly . Naturally they are of no consequence . Nevertheless , they will be happy before they die . Which of our number is that ? It has our shape , but it is not of our species . Come here ! Stop that one ! Oh , don 't ever ask me to do that again . They had the minds of geniuses and the instincts of vultures . What do they want ? They 're a species that live on radiation . Radiation ? It 's the only kind of energy they can assimilate . What do they want here ? Their planet ran out of radiation . They 're starving . Unless they get a huge intake soon , they 're gonna die . They want our nuclear waste dumps ... Wait a minute , that could benefit us . Let 's give them our nuclear waste . - It 's not that easy . - Why not ? They need the intense radiation they will get from blowing up the dumps . Blow up ? That would destroy us . They 've got control of our minds so that we 'll blow them up . Why haven 't they blown up the dumps themselves ? They have little kinetic energy . They can 't handle physical activity . They plan to manipulate us to explode them . How ? By making us think we 're doing one thing when we 're doing another . That 's what they did to me in the Eagle . Alan , Bartlett and Ehrlich ! That 's where they really are . They 're still on the surface . And they were flying in an Eagle . I still see the pilot ship . They 're at the atomic waste dumps . They 're going to detonate them . They can 't do that without atomic fuel . ( Koenig ) There 's your atomic fuel . That 's the trigger to blow up the dumps . - They won 't do it . - They won 't know they 're doing it . Computer , lock entrance to atomic fuel store . ( Koenig ) I 've got to get to an Eagle . Hold it , John ! Where do you think you 're going ? Tony , I must have an Eagle . Listen to me . Stay back . Helena ... How did he get out of Medical Centre ? He just broke loose . Then why didn 't you give the alarm ? He could 've hurt himself and us . I 'm sorry , Tony . I 'll keep him under restraints . Yeah . You do that . Stay with the commander . Make sure he 's taken care of . Coming , Dr Shaw ? Helena ! Commander ! Helena . John . - Alan ? - Still in the atomic fuel store . How long would it take to process our people , make all of them immune to the aliens ? It would take days , John . Unless we can break the aliens ' hold on our people , I 'll never save Alpha . - There may be a way . - What ? I sometimes use a sonic anaesthetic . It 's called White Noise . It works by blocking nerve pads in the brain . That would obstruct the telepathic input of the aliens . Amplify it and transmit it to all of our people . Let 's go . Helena , stay away from those aliens in Command Centre , or they 'll take you over again . Make sure these things are set to stun . Let 's hope the aliens don 't read your mind , Helena . They 'll try and use our people to stop us . Hold it ! It was set to kill . Don 't , Tony ! - What 's going on here ? - Shut up ! Helena ! ( High-pitched whirring ) ( Grows gradually higher ) That 's as much as I can give it . What about Alan and the others ? Will the sound reach them ? They 'll get it through their helmets . But it won 't be powerful enough if the aliens choose to block it . ( Whirring stops ) Kill them ! No ! They get their power from energy . They 've disappeared . Vanished . - We 've won . - The atomic fuel store . We haven 't stopped them . They 're going to Bartlett with the trigger . Tony , Maya . ( # Beethoven 's 5th Symphony ) The aliens know about White Noise . They must be concentrating on Alan , Ehrlich and Bartlett . Where are they getting their strength ? All electrical equipment on Alpha emits a minute amount of radiation . They must be getting it from that . Helena , cut all non-essential power , all except communications . Out . - ( Tony ) I can 't see them . - They 're there somewhere . Alan , this is Commander Koenig . Do you read me ? Alan ? 'Alan , are you receiving me ? Come in , Alan . Answer , Alan ! 'This is Eagle 1 to Alan Carter . Are you receiving ? ' ( Tony ) There , on the left . ( Koenig ) Switch on scanners . ( Tony ) There they are ! Alan ! Ehrlich ! This is Koenig . Do you read me ? 'Alan , do you read me ? 'Alan , do you read me ? Come in , Alan . ' - Touch down in front of them . - No , Commander . The terrain is too crumbly , we 'd go straight through . - Drop me in front of them . - All right . Maya , prepare to depressurise . ( Koenig ) ' Decompression complete . Lower away . ' Alan , stop ! Alan , stop . You don 't know what you 're doing . Ehrlich , stop him . Ehrlich ! Alan , stop ! ( Maya ) ' Decompression complete . ' ( Tony ) All right , now move it , Maya ! No , Ehrlich . Ehrlich ! Alan , it 's me , John . Ehrlich , listen to me . Listen to me ! Ehrlich , you don 't know what you 're doing ! Aagh ! ( Air hissing ) ( Air still hissing ) ( Maya ) Commander , Ehrlich 's losing air . His pack is punctured . Tony , we 've got to get Ehrlich back to Alpha fast . - ' He needs depressurising . ' - Coming in now , John . Alan ! Alan , wait ! Alan ! Alan , WAIT ! Alan ! ALAN ! ALAN ! ( Maya ) ' Tony , take him up . ' Bartlett , come out here and give me a hand . ( Alien ) When you 're inside , you will seal the door . Maya . Yes , Commander ? 'There are aliens everywhere . All over the place . ' They can 't harm you . They need their energy to control Alan and Bartlett . He can 't get through . They 've got the door sealed . They have reached the nuclear core . Soon we will have all the radiation we need . He has broken through ! It doesn 't matter . They will resist him . - Maya . - ' Yes , Commander ? ' How come the aliens are still controlling them ? Everything 's off . Where are they getting the energy ? The human brain generates electrical activity . There may be enough to keep them going at survival level . When people are unconscious , their brain activity is reduced , right ? 'Very greatly . ' 'Knock everyone out except you and the chief engineer . ' Unconscious ? - Unconscious . - ' John ... ' - Don 't argue . Can you do it ? - Yes , I can , but ... Just do it ! Out . ( Hissing ) Alan ! Bartlett ! It 's atomic fuel ! You were about to plug it into the core . - We 'd have blown up the planet ! - Right . You and Alan have been living an illusion ! But you 've broken the aliens ' control . Now help ME ! Maya , Bartlett 's returned to normal . 'Careful . They 're running out of energy . 'The little they have left will be focused on Alan . ' Bartlett , they 're still controlling him . Alan , it 's all right . It 's all over . ( Alien ) Is it ? No , that won 't help . You learn quickly , John Koenig . - That is hopeful . - Hopeful for whom ? Yes , it 's true , Bartlett , you have been living in an illusion . But haven 't you been happier than you 've ever been on Alpha ? Living your life reunited with your loved ones , living , as it were , back on Earth . Yes , but it 's not real , you 've been living a dream . ( Alien ) Isn 't a dream of happiness better than a reality you hate ? Bartlett , help me . ( Alien ) Can you really face growing old and dying on this piece of debris ? How long can the dream last ? When the nuclear waste is triggered , all ... all human life ... on the moon will be wiped out . ( Alien ) 'How long ' is a meaningless term . A pygmy 's phrase . Time is relative . A butterfly lives a gloriously full life in a day , a single-celled organism in a microsecond . So long as one is fulfilled , time is irrelevant . ( Koenig ) Bartlett , don 't listen . Help me ! We can offer the people of Alpha a complete life , as it would be with your loved ones in your homes on Earth . A life without pain or sorrow , without fear or loss . This is what we offer . Bartlett , use your laser . Stun Alan . Now , put the trigger in the atomic core . ( Bleeping ) ( Koenig , panting ) Stop him ! Stop him , Bartlett . It 's futile to call on Bartlett for help . He 's immobilised . Alan , listen to me ! It 's Koenig . It 's Koenig ! You 're a truly primitive organism , Commander . We could have given you an eternity of happiness in an instant of time . Now your life will be what the life of your species has always been - cruel and futile . It 's better to live as your own man ... than as a fool in someone else 's dream . So much for illusions . Maya , what was that creature that you transformed into ? - A laren . - A what ? A laren . Its natural habitat was a moon of Psychon . How does it survive ? It can store oxygen like a camel can store water . - And it 's very strong . - Maya , put me down . Maya , quit fooling around . Put me down ! - How long before they wake up ? - About ten minutes . Can 't you speed it up ? No ! How am I supposed to run a base of Sleeping Beauties ? It was your idea . She might have been an illusion but ... I said it was your ... idea .

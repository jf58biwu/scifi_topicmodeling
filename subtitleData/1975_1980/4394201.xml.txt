'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' You mustn 't go . - What is this ? - The side door . The front door was simple , so was the alarm . - Good . There were children . - Where ? In the yard , playing on the step . They disappeared . - I thought they 'd gone inside . - No . No one came through the door . There doesn 't appear to be anyone in the bottom part of the building . How many children ? Seven . What did they look like ? I don 't know , they were just children . It wasn 't clear . Were they real ? - I didn 't really see enough ... - From what you did see . No , I don 't think they were real . Nor do I think they were images . I think they were something in-between . Is this the place ? Maybe . Some kind of shop . Lost property . - That 's what they sell ? - And buy . You mean people lose these things ? The purpose of this place , and places like it , is to trade lost property . This is a cross between a second-hand bargain shop and a pawnbroker 's . There 's nothing new here . No . A room full of triggers . Thousands of them . - It could be any one of them . - No . - Time has broken through , hasn 't it ? - Yes . And we , as usual , have been told too late . We 're not too late to stop it . But too late to have prevented it in the first place . We should have been here before things break through . - Someone should be here waiting . - That 's impossible . - It 's not . - There aren 't enough of us . There are more than enough of us . Well , who would volunteer ? - Volunteer ? - Yes . To sit and wait . Maybe for hundreds of earth years . Would you ? Well , that depends . You wouldn 't . I know you . There are those of us who are good at sitting about and doing nothing . They do it nonstop . The specialists . The specialists ? ! Well , what are we ? What am I ? You 're an operator . We 're all operators . Oh , those . This particular operator has made up his mind about something and in his expert opinion , this room is loaded with active triggers . Any one of them could cause a breakthrough . Some of them even speak for themselves . Well , this one has nothing to say . - What ? - No one 's ever died by this sword . Not even been hurt by it . Ever . - It 's a depressing place , isn 't it ? - Yes . Nothing here but the belongings of the poor , the hopeless and the dead . That 's right . But it is in here . No . In this building , yes . In this room , no . You mean it hasn 't had to use any of this ? How can you be so sure ? It hasn 't needed to . But wherever the time-break is , it 's very close by . I do know that much . - ' Steel ? ' - ' Yes ? ' 'Move to the door . 'Tell me what you see . ' - ' What am I looking for ? ' - ' A child . 'Somewhere in here with us , hiding . ' - ' I don 't see any child . ' - ' Just stay by the door , 'I 'll try to find her . ' # See , saw , sacradown # Which is the way to London town ? # One foot up and the other foot down This is the way to London town # - ' Did you hear that ? ' - ' Hear what ? ' 'A child 's voice . Chanting a rhyme . A kind of skipping song . ' 'No , I didn 't hear it . ' 'I think I 've found her . 'Stay where you are . Watch the door . 'I 've found her . Whatever she is , I 've found her . ' Steel ! 'This is the way to London town . ' - That was it . - The time-break , it was part of it . - You said it wasn 't this room ... - I said it didn 't start here . - It 's using things from here . - " It " ? The child - or what appeared to be a child . I saw you , from here . I could see . I couldn 't move but I could see . - I could see you . - Yes ? It was ... It was as if you were part of a photograph . You were the same . What did the child look like ? She looked like she was from a photograph . Her hair , clothes , colour quality , as if she was part of an old photograph . Except that she was three-dimensional . Yes . And for a short time , we weren 't . Photographs ! Is that how it 's being done ? Is that how time 's broken through ? With a little help and encouragement , maybe . Let 's look upstairs . I 'm sorry ... I just wanted to play , that 's all . Anyway , I 'm sorry . I have said I 'm sorry . And I think you 'd better come home . Now . Please come home . # Eenie , meanie , nacaracca ... # Steel ! Look . Can you see them ? Yes . Yes , this time I do . It 's children again . It always seems to be children . Yes . Well , somebody 's at home . Someone isn 't too bothered about opening their mail . " Mr H Williamson . " " H Williamson , Esquire . " - " H Williamson . " - How far back do they go ? Several months . No food , no provisions . Whoever he is , he appears to live here above his shop . He appears to sleep here but he doesn 't eat or read his mail . He reads books , though . There are more here on the same subject . Tumbler and spring . The wards are here , the bolt there . He does more than just read about it . - Old photographs again . - Yes . When somebody 's hobby is photography , doesn 't that mean they take new photographs ? Usually , yes . Especially with this kind of equipment . Why aren 't there any new photographs ? - Well , can you see any ? - No . Steel . There 's something wrong with this photograph . The balance is wrong . Things are missing . - What things ? - People . Whose mistake was that ? The photographer ? No , the balance was there when it was taken - the people were there . Four ... Four small figures . Children . Four children were in this photograph . They were part of it . They belong to it . You mean it 's been faked ? Been worked on ? No . The background 's intact , so is where the children were standing . - And the water 's still there . - What water ? The water they spilt when they were drinking at the fountain ... in 1884 . 96 years ago . All right , children . - Children taken from photographs . - Or lost . Or stolen . I suppose you could call it a different kind of lost property . I think the same thing 's happened to that one . And this . And to all of them . Do you remember the child in the shop below ? I think she belongs there . - So these children are not alive ? - No . And you said they 're not ghosts or images . But something in-between . # See , saw , sacradown ... # - What about these ? - # One foot up and the other ... # I expect they 're waiting to be brought here . - This ... - This is the way to London town . How quaint . There 's someone in there - alone . What the ? Look , if you want the landlord , he isn 't in . And if you want me , I 'm not in either . So ... out . - The landlord ? - He isn 't in . - He lives below ? - Yes . - He owns the shop ? - The whole building . I pay my rent . - So , would you mind ? - We haven 't finished . Well , I have . Look , tell your boyfriend , will you ? Doors are for knocking on , you don 't just barge in . Just a minute ! Who are you anyway ? Police ? Creditors ? What ? - We 're visitors . - I 'm sorry but ... - Do you live alone ? - Of course I live alone . Turn that thing off . Now , just a minute ! Here ! I can 't move . For God 's sake ... If you live alone , why are there two beds in this room ? Why are there another person 's clothes in the cupboard ? They belong to my friend . Now , let me move , you 're scaring me . - Where 's your friend now ? - She hasn 't been home for a while . - For how long ? - For several months . - She left without any of her things ? - Yes . - Have you heard from her since ? - No . Bring her with you . Look , I said I have to work . - The old landlord left . - When ? Several months ago . I suppose he must have sold out . He left all his furniture , his photographic gear . - Have you seen him since ? - No . - What about the new landlord ? - He 's marvellous . Well , he doesn 't bother me . He doesn 't even ask for his rent . I just leave it on the stairs when I feel like it . All right , so he can 't be earning much . He wouldn 't , would he ? He never opens the shop . A man who earns his living in a shop that 's never open ? Maybe he 's waiting . - Waiting ? What for ? - I don 't know . Do some work on the place ? Get rid of the ghosts . Ghosts ? Here ! You can 't go in there . It 's private . These ... ghosts ... Oh , they don 't bother me . Well , not so far . All right , the place is haunted . But the rent 's cheap . Anyway , they 're only little ghosts . About that high . - You 've seen them ? - Glimpses , that 's all . This new landlord ... Oh , he 's all right . He 's always talking about his kids . Children ! The way he talks about them , he must have dozens of them . I 've not seen them , though . Not yet . - Describe him . - What ? - The new landlord . - Describe him . Well , he 's ... - That 's weird . - What is ? Well , I 've known the man a few months , talked to him like I 'm talking to you now ... - That 's crazy ! - Tell us . Well , I ... I don 't know what he looks like . There are some people here . - People ? - Yes . - What kind of people ? - A man and a lady . Can we hurt them ? Oh , please ! Let 's hurt them . What 's wrong ? They haven 't come to send us back , have they ? Because we don 't want to go back , we want to stay here with you . No one 's come to send you back , my children . I brought you here , brought you with me . No one else on this world can send you back . You just remember that . I mean , that really is crazy ! I 've talked to the man , talked to him face to face and ... yet I can 't remember his face . Be still , my children . Be still .

 for I 'm by where on on on Yahoo 200 room just Roberts my problem and got this groaned to do some kind of work up there that 's the last we heard it 's not moving 21 wrong if I were to say noticed anything unusual it would really only with hindsight there was nothing strange about her behavior she simply dissipated wrong home makes no sense I mean how can people just an issue love face it is in this day and age with the right to know what 's going on wrong those people who just seein at all lost someone close to them a relative a colleague a friend lost in mysterious circumstances sudden and inexplicable disappearance without trace if you 're wondering what this other story important some even tragic though it may be has to do with science report well we have to go back in time some 18 months when we began work on another film which examined the scientific brain drain from Britain that Phil was never completed because are far as lead us into some stranger unexpected by way obey in that time that beautiful through about okay because of trouble-free about she 's about we begin the special with of about on computer go Ramada Hotel comment but doctor on club who works in this building is one of Britain 's younger generation a percent sign especially on Etsy its solar energy like many others in her position and clock is contemplating joining the brain drain and leaving the country was in Cali Italian question facilities I mean look miss i 'm suppose work out of do this building if I and people like me are going to do the job we 've been trying to do and okay with doing we must be given the means to do % um my so phone today shortly after this film was taken I 'm clock make decisions was not however a decision she felt able to talk about time they went into the building they say they have food is not yeah I 'm sorry who can you tell us exactly what 's going on I 'm sorry condom home I 'm going away what exactly is happening okay has the most feasible have a lot of ground what was going on called and got here because of pretrial case throughout friend you your do for you you know hi airline passengers should yet another record around talk to me because after home after or any other day the only evidence she was here at all is that abandoned car beyond that nothing go yeah yeah well I 've done everything okay to try to get some kind of monster but there 's nothing committee just see with sorry we don 't know anything about Chopra Robert Pattinson is or otherwise a senior lecturer in mathematics in Andrews University these photos were taken by his sister when he with his wife idea to children left this house on the morning dove November the mine 1975 I 'm so not by car to London 's Heathrow Airport what happened after that we don 't know on leaving the Royal Air Force where he worked in special projects Brian penumbra had thirties patterns that he was going to work for an electronics firm in Sydney Australia he sent photographs of his life at that and for a time kept in touch by letter and there 's this trend has going out and we said why don 't you look at our own getting this prize William got there just give him and who to Brian despite the letters and photographs would remain unexplained there 's no further evidence about Brian Pendlebury other than the fact that his name appears to have been checked in at London 's Heathrow Airport for a flight to Sydney that so far as we can discover is the last anyone ever saw him and clock Robert Pattison and rampant just 3 avi four hundred names compiled for of projected son 's report brain drain from Britain for this office our research has begun checking through everyone we were looking for patents whether people leaving this country what were the reasons and what was that feelings about it afterwards but uttered those four hundred names it became apparent that 24 have disappeared without trace some eleven others with offenders whether they go and why and indeed ho what if anything was the common factor and and and local bank radio telescope where although no one realized the time the second part of a complex story was beginning to unfold to win in Ballantyne distinguished radio astronomer was sitting out on a journey he was never to complete I 'm hey Valentine was a worried man that much we know if my phone call he made from this isolation books not far from the mainland notably cool tones news agency managing editor John Henry on and how did he seem to you you just have to do which usual because with the cop so businessman moment is it was driving up to London and wanted to see really does it provide news was tried received a package which is based in the day before right said I had contain this who take would you do any given up looking to the Allied I which vehicles next morning I heard about the accident the sped across the crash were taken by agency cameraman despite considerable news coverage only one photo was made available to the national press I 'm tired 3 our own independent experts examine those photographs undersized accident itself when I 'm Sunday no they drew no firm conclusions except to say that the cause of the accident remains to them at least cuny unclear but what if the videotape which ballantine had been so anxious to get safe it to his friend John Henry a better film picture just deceased just noise space I no different from countries are the tapes in the archives radios from I 'll us we were assured no solution here mysteriously bob Harig around what it meant what was the peace dove vital information somewhere in Ballantyne have deciphered from this apparently I 'm random cacophony that was something we have to wait much longer to find out in the meantime however something happened which at least at first seem to offer is some sort through outside senator cool was put through the science report of I found myself talking to a man with an American accent refused to give his name for any other details himself over the phone he told the only that he had met William balance of on a visit the British astronomer had made shortly before his death to nasa spaces courses in Houston Texas we arrange to meet not far from here one hour 's time okay 100 what you 're about to see may be considered by many of you unethical however we believe that in the light of subsequent developments our action was justified Benson was equipped with a miniaturized transmitter so that we could recalled the conversation between and a hidden camera was positioned near the market where the meeting been a wreck convention yes other no too much to handle right this is something you have to know for anyone who wants to know that 's on me community reducing my way cooking time but before a little higher I 'm sorry dressing rooms reno news one concern here for a location reasons you know what I mean like time you learn you know what happened I don 't know why it happened got to get on my computer hard at the moment here very you are missing with a stick to beat only one conference in the morning from 1300 you guys constitutions witnesses started thirty caught everything from there it it come and dance arrived at the address he was given shortly before 10 : 30 the next day together with the pool camera crew going but ok no Cup good eventually it was a we show you the next part in the film on cod and exactly as we shot it on that day we take one going Anglia Television Times report food this is that number 88 min okay remember the television crews see mister I 'm crazy American Harry not saying coming clean me out thank you on lot you don 't get much ok wanna and I 'm whose think you yesterday you 're gonna you know hidden 100 if you don 't have to go sometime house if you know where you got your question yeah for K your gourd do going okay it was the last we saw love the mysterious young American despite returning with the police barely half an hour later kept watch on this house several days we found no one knows well however more pieces have this strange patton continue to fit into place the great world Russia that summer was unequaled in recorded history Europe 's normally agree indebted country we 've reduced to a dust calf fun question goss have to be provided with increasing miscast water and fed next winter 's fatah in Britain it was the same story a parched fields and book rocks confronts forest fire controlled activist a huge areas at work ok vast reservoirs dried up I 'm stunned pipes were brought into the worst-hit areas summer which has added 20 days supply of water left the River Thames was reduced to its lowest level in living memory there was no panic only a growing sense that money is that what we 're experiencing was on natural and that the Earth 's climate was moving towards a radical change Melbourne Australia where the Yarra River was reduced to a polluted trickle in which fish in water life were almost completely destroyed before water restrictions tightened desperate efforts were made to save the router invaluable trees in Melbourne 's famous Botanical Gardens northern India I was in the grip of the worst heatwave for over 50 years in Bihar the temperature reached 48 degrees centigrade 120 degrees Fahrenheit thousands died and the hardship to animals and crops was unimaginable I 'll the African desert continued its gradual and on for Thailand destroying all in its wake the the meanwhile in China and the Middle East unparalleled earthquakes killed millions far more than might have been expected from

me to yugoslavia many engines times were reduced to rubble international rescue teams evacuated thousands from the threatened area but many others with two broken by the experience to leave scientists began to suspect that the balance at the earth 's ecology was far more difficult poised the net yet realized at the height of the drug we interviewed at Cambridge University someone prepared to offer the beginnings of an awesome and give them something you 'd expect things considered he 'd called just turns serious when he first put them for whatever twenty years ago have been almost universally dismissed he was called not alarmist in a pessimist events proved him on the contrary to be something of an optimist by the late sixties the earth was already so trapped within envelope with its own pollution that heat from the Sun and the Earth 's industrial processes was having increasing difficulty in escaping ten years earlier than Gaston 's prediction the notorious greenhouse effect a thickening up the outer atmosphere due to the eightfold increase in the carbon dioxide levels had become a reality as the atmosphere became more dense extreme variations of temperature what experienced from intense heat to equal amplitude North America suffered the worst winter on record rivers froze solid and even the great Niagara for record guide but the most frightening discovery with scientists made was that last year 's on melted my is the next step to a future I 'm unavoidable price for the Huntsville Alabama conference on 1957 my head is where not mean circuses summer came seen his government advises but by then it goes it was too late poses with people can you tell me what happened to come home the usual thing the politicians come running to us then we can this pickle nature when we doing comp visit why didn 't we do something good when we come the province 's starts calling him ok booth at home was anything achieved by the conference there was some discussion seekers can you tell me about that home only theoretical both but I can understand other not look for a bit to say is that with the alternatives for discussion has two faces forget about them third alternative maybe no case but I don 't know within things over the numbers can implement laws at the time that interview was filmed cargoes time refused to say anything further about alternative 3 in the second part of this special program which will show you how we uncovered that information for ourselves we also bringing up remarkable interview with former astronaut but grodin filmed in secret his hideaway in New England stay with us that this is astronaut upgrade in before his first moonwalk more than one of the men who were positive that based upon a program find it difficult to readjust tonight back on earth but no one mo so the mismatch areas he is today five years of there were psychological factors it seemed which on the surface could explain away their changes in personality the instability the breakdown of former relationships but what exactly were those psychological factors are are the we 're a the No the murder her for for for her her IOC for for for hi for I i 'm for for for haha for for driver tango jezabelle a former code but meaning what certainly nothing to the $ 600 million people listening on earth below from Boston Massachusetts we arranged for except for naught upgraded to talk to us the interview was filmed to be edited letter can you hear me all right can you hear me and custom got going Griffin showed no reluctance to discuss the breakdown it suffered after his return from space but nothing remarkable seems likely to come from the interview until I asked this question it 's been suggested among others by some very responsible people with you already won the Apollo program so far more out there the new been allowed to admit publicly would you like to comment on that suggestion hard worker card can ask your work harder I present it right comment concrete our current got octagon convert on your crime rate honecker jock here what 's the matter with standoff don 't somebody thomas was summer that somewhere so far as we could discover with neither in London nor in Bostock 10 hours but in the satellite connecting the two the incident has never been explained limits that one word Valentine was enough to send comments the camera operation somebody innocent-looking home movie equipment across the Atlantic posing as tourists this is what they brought back on eight-millimeter Phil I would never have found and with on stock you need I had I was brought eventually to the remote bungalow working down there grew up here from for public I bank we have a couple beers who well when wondered why do it out here and there that make a difference I don 't even have a private conversation with crack Marco Bailey Rick professor time your rather be alone class any shot my daughter right you put that on the record part you great kid with her idea I 'm very lucky we talk for an hour before growth in became willing to discuss our previous an abortive stuff like interview Friday one sack us about them I 'll well remember felt I Z showed up at nasa some of its okay and he got really excited when the ferry back images of jukebox all into color you can pick up a single you got equipment but you can 't to the cast family without necessary women track and some young guy come do it in on their was a this month it could be it looks like a a serial number his phone what you 're saying is that so balance I was killed because it would discover them at a 510 I decide the is going to look at him panda an overlooked because they lived in the same then skies quandary over okay okay what did happen out there probably a kind think this form you can get their first me Solaire polished their smokescreen to cover up what is really going on here alabaster any tell not for what is going on US pentagon phone from Italy space are you located gave up do you give up 13 of you know you gonna tell me what is going on wanted to see well we came down the wrong place call local see talking about men from a you think today me ball at Kraft job for you get two guys uptown high school Helly no you know I would to give them a good PR story for Ohio with a few space with Iceland here keeping bombs have starting from asking questions over okay I was really going on out there but that 's it hardship story excellent okay FEA suspicion unanswered questions possibly murder what we did was back in London we did what we could to investigate the claims made by accepting of upgraded Catherine what reports Institute of International Business Studies known for two it was good was thinking of a pension with the crime on people 's behind couple me here talk to the press a key court important of a major study of US-soviet code smudged shorter sorry is it I know nothing no US-soviet relations beyond what has already been made public we had celebrated docking in space some time ago this was presented as an isolated exercise and as far as I know it was exactly that maybe paving the way for more to come a why and all all long room all for tho for I for find a broader issues of soviet US cooperation there is an element of mystery which possible as many people at my feet you have to put it in the simplest not it was going on the stat counties the piece has been maintained the past 25 years you mean the experts at battled but also for one 's in agreement and into the popular myth that it 's been improved for the balance and you a dozen and K holed up in time and the more you look in this sense it makes it too many about scenes especially when you put it into perspective history say what is your explanation essentially what we 're suggesting news that the day highest level of east-west diplomacy there is operating factor which we know nothing now it could just be could that this unknown factor is a massive but covered operation in space asked the reason behind it well we 're not in the business speculation on throughout all 12 are care and I think well I say hi for way to quiet all pollen I for our par are all wrong all Paul the are are this just a colossal needed to prove it from the Gov gravitational field not books ingredients words two men on a bus of the for Hey for half are for of hey the do but supporters such immense power did not have to be chief you consumed nearly getting into space first of all from spent kinda travel with that bring with in August obviously we could go further with less power or room send a much larger craft that in fact the only way we 're going to see space travel in the scale is by this kind of extraterrestrial launching for instance for a space platform orbiting the Earth door the moon shower you know if we get the material there to build a craft that make real good sense could we transport materials that did take one helluva shuttle but yeah we have machines no in theory we could do it especially if we had some sort of international cooperation looming over and me visual shopping Want to work the more we also have told random a man who live and work in the several months at a time when they were doing on lar thing are base fuck are visits by one side to the other Kia soviet technicians and astronauts greeted by their American counterparts have been dismissed diplomatic Curtis we have a working relationship it 's quite good with the Soviet Union I 'm sure it 's going to continue for russian crosswords vesco monkey to send could lead to the same here the first with a living creature like dawned when they made three years later the gigantic step with the first man in space Eureka got it up and later on the first woman Valentina the drive to make the first man on the Moon American was launched by President Kennedy on the bench and the first wave of nuclear power and this generation does not in camp up by owner in the back wall upcoming a cure thank we mean to be a part of it we may delete slightly late sixties russians it seems could simply have dropped often stopped right and you today Cape Canaveral is virtually abandoned a deserted reinforced comes the most ambitious project history ok seem to be the No are we to believe that this is where it all ends at the estimated 2000 launchings from earth the space at least 62 percent have been by the russians the near side of the Moon service the side visible to us here on earth the flags indicated not as landings American and Soviet cropped among the spaceships the russians and up was the Vostok supposedly not intended to reach the phone service but in 1972 this sighting was reported on on for for our ok on in hi her haha ok russian mom like mention it name yet home stations design him used collection yeah penny half if the russians with the first on the moon with the unmanned rocket which landed here in 1959 here exactly 10 years later Neil Armstrong landed but I researches show another Patna landings on the far side of the Moon the dockside the side hidden from us here on earth are we to assume that this remarkable grouping American and Soviet landings is mere coincidence when we returned to Cambridge and presented up the cargoes time with the information which so far acquired he finally agreed to speak on record about alternative three we had agreed to the council concludes that there was nothing we could do Scott I the world population for the consumption of resources a central saliva loner alternatives 30 was a much more limited options it was an attempt to ensure that at least some oh the humanity survive the cons you yes the technicians but we realize we were talking about the kind you space to budget only appeared in scientific sixties want to win go to some other planets and we 'll get the hell off this one less there 's still time doctor call goes to then went on to discuss the kinda cross-section they would like to see getaway about sciences Sunday Oct in fact all aspects as far as possible acumen culture he said that the list would never be complete but it would be better than nothing these avocados you saw idea or from people who disappeared without trace of explanation joining the last 18 months in other countries they have some analysts for people forming left same kind of cross-sectional have caused this time described all were in good health and all under the age 55 but what if they 've got here is a picture have a supposedly dead planet the nearest 12 s mas would appear to offer little prospect of survival if these photographs from biking to it to be believed but other Charles Wilborn himself seem surprised that the Americans up spending so much money and putting the probe on the surface of mars should then equip it with a camera but it is focused up to 100 meters or is common bentsen suggested the average size of a large film studio what 's your awesome what you gotta remember that all these pictures that we get coming through nasa than a given to the rest of us they say is mars we have to believe the same thing with audio mmm I mean we don 't hear everything that said between mission control in the space craft is a second child the call biological channel officially it 's just for reporting on medical details have a fact that 's the one they switch to when they have something to say they don 't want the whole world to listen in on I mean sure but could be a studio in Burbank but I mean cuts sake mad enough all passed close enough to moes sent back the best photographs service we have so of but was it all just like this monster has always been a sources destination to mankind missed it India that is astronomy my house was believed to have artificially constructed in the house which was taken as evidence intelligent life on the planet later this theory was discovered in its place we had a picture badan indisputable plan this inimical to the survival in any form of light then movies the an interesting idea was before suppose life had existed on Mars as the climate another conditions worsened any surviving life would have formed into a state hi bunny awaiting the return a more favorable conditions it was even suggested that the atmosphere which had sustained out may have a come into the apt in the surface so I love the plant there was in the cats several years ago which meet this did he persuades mosses schools had a covering a cloud betting and density different times until the climate which doctor goes time spent when the perfect for to be never previously observed mishap and was scientifically 1960 it was obvious the storms of colossal proportions taking when the contravention some change see the icecaps it substantially decreased in size and around the equatorial regions a broadband da car coloring and appeared this it has been suggested was vegetation I cargoes times t was that these storms could have been caused by a nuclear explosion delivered from her the same here the russians had a great space disaster only their spectra recorded this was kept secret lock it blew up a launching number two people were killed large area devastated what with the russians trying to launch and if they succeed lose the rocket carrying a nuclear device which would account for the devastation caused a nuclear device which is the second victim was delivered to the surface a month causing the dynamic changes recorded in 1961 48 hours ago Catherine like was at her desk in the production office as a matter of course by now all incoming filled with liquid high school top conference on comp hundred-pound perfectly I I 'm yes her hi I 'm how come quarter what happened to harry I don 't know they promised me that if I clone you are going lol Yahoo I 'm how we wanted you to have I 've no idea what it is you gotta get me some way too high don 't worry we 'll I 've no idea what I don 't want to come it 's a printed circuit people that you have to pick it to I 'm I he something 40 you and and you get a beautiful got me anything we have it and he said that you 've got to I 'm playback on time tape who we connections of the print said and played once again the videotape but Sir William Bell in time before his death simply spread Jon Hamm this time we have 10 an acceptable picture which are not about to see as we saw it fire for for for ha for for for on % ah for for on ha % ah for for on for for for for for for on ha for % ah for for on for on I 've we believe that to be an authentic record the first and secret landing on mars by unmanned space probe from us we also believe the date given made the 22nd 1962 to be accurate clearly the blankets have total security by which this information has been covered could only be maintained by the active cooperation governments at very high level he quickly that must 've been possible reasons why the true conditions on Mars suitable as they appear to be the human habitat have been kept secret indeed the effort which has gone into this trading the rest of the world that the opposite is true argues that some operation of supreme importance has been going on beneath the security cover we believe that that operation is doctor congress times alternative 3 whether a human survival colony has already been established on mars when the plans are still in preparation for its transportation from the moon to mars we don 't know but we 've got this program tonight as a challenge to those who do now to tell us the truth we 're a group if the implications of what you 've seen less than optimistic for the future life on this planet it has been our task however to present the facts as we understand them and to await the response goodnight of the No of the the the the of all half the Duke golf

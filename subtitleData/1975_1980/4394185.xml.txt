Please ! - ' Upstairs and ... ' - Wait for me , Rob ! - Don 't listen to it ! - It 's ... coming ... through ! 'Upstairs and downstairs , upstairs ... ' - Downstairs . - No ! 'Upstairs and downstairs , 'upstairs and downstairs , 'upstairs and downstairs , upstairs and downstairs ... ' - Go ! - ' Upstairs and downstairs , 'upstairs and downstairs ... ' 'The north wind doth blow and we shall have snow 'And what will Poor Robin do then , poor thing ? 'He 'll sit in a barn and keep himself warm 'And hide his head under his wing , poor thing 'Poor thing ... ' 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' 'The north wind doth blow 'And we shall have snow 'And what will Poor Robin do then ? ' Sapphire was right - first a wall , then a room ! 'Head under his wing ... ' Steel ! It 's going to take everything ! Sapphire ? It 's all finished . It 's all over . Sit down . All right ? Another rhyme . - I know . - I told you to watch the child ! - And I do . - Why did you say another rhyme ? It got into a page in a book and then into her head . Anyway , I 've burnt the page and the book . Helen , are you all right ? What happened ? Are you sure you 're all right ? - How far has it got ? - Top landing , top stairs . 'Poor thing . Poor thing . 'Poor thing . Poor thing . 'Poor thing . Poor thing . Poor thing . Come on , Helen , let 's show him how we caught the paper . Sapphire ? It tried to melt it . - Is it still cold enough ? - Yeah , just . We could always let it go . Knowing what it 's capable of doing ? Do you think it would scurry back up the stairs to mum for comfort ? Hang on to her the way you 've been hanging on to Sapphire ? - No . - Good . Cos if we let this go we let everything go . And too much ground has been lost already . Is it quite safe in there ? Come out here and close the door ! Let 's start tidying up . No soldiers this time . Just a good strong north wind . Amazing what it can conjure up , isn 't it ? Sorry . - What 's it doing ? - Staying put . 'Poor thing . Poor thing . ' - You think it 's describing itself ? - ' Poor thing . Poor thing ... ' I doubt it . Have you seen anything ? No , nothing . No refractions , nothing . Just that same sound over and over . - As if it 's out of things to say . - ' Poor thing . Poor thing ... ' You might as well come down . 'Poor thing . Poor thing . 'Poor thing ... ' What are we looking for ? - Patches of light . - Patches of what ? Patches of light . I have one hostage downstairs but there are more on the loose . What do these patches of light do ? - They hide from us . - Well , that 's all right , isn 't it ? They hide from us because they like to lie in wait for us . They like to surprise us . They almost destroyed Sapphire . Sounds very organised . Maybe you could learn something from them . Steel , that 's not my business . Excuse me . - It 's all full . - Good . Wait ... - Outside ? - Yes . - Through the front door ? - Yes . - Oh , you nearly tripped , Sapphire ! - Yes , be careful . Ooh ! Oh , it 's cold out there ! Dad ! But what are you doing in here ? Well , why shouldn 't I be in here ? But you disappeared ! Disappeared ? What on earth are you talking about ? Disappeared ? Rob ? Close the door , Rob , there 's a good lad . - Close it ? - Yes . Close it . Rob ? Rob ? Perhaps he went upstairs to help Steel ? Perhaps he did . Come around here and I 'll pick these up . Shh . Why do we have to close the door , Dad ? Everything 's all right now , isn 't it ? Now that you 're back . It 's cold in here , Dad . I 'm freezing . Cold ? Oh , yes , I suppose it is . Dad ? I want to open that door . Please ? All right , Rob . - I should 've known , I suppose . - Known what ? That I 'd be wasting my time trying to fool you . That 's right . Go on then , open the door . Call out to your so-called friends . That way you really will put me in danger . And not only me , your mother as well . And yourself . - And Helen ? - Oh , yes , and Helen . Because I didn 't really disappear , Rob , I 've been here in the house all the time . - Hiding . - Hiding ? - Yes ! - And Mum ? She 's been with me . We 've both been hiding . - But why ? - Don 't you know why ? Yes , because the house is being threatened . - By them . - Who ? I mean , I could never fool you , Rob ... but they 've fooled you . - Steel and Sapphire ? - Yes ! They 're the real danger , the real threat , nothing else is . Had you never stopped to think that , never once wondered about them ? Rob ? - I thought he was with you . - No . Rob ? Rob , are you down there ? Rooooob ! Shh ! Now ... you must trust me , Rob . Yes . There 's only one place . I want you ... to help me . - Of course , Dad , but ... - I want you to come with me . Your mother and I ... we really need your help , Rob . - Don 't you want to see your mother ? - Of course ! - Come on , I 'll take you to her . - Where is she ? I 've told you , she 's hiding . She 's waiting for you , Rob . Waiting to see you ! - Your hand , Dad ... - What ? It 's so cold , like ice . We 'll soon be warm . Come on . He 's not here . - It 's tidy again ! - Now do you believe me ? Steel ! Hold it down . There 's something crossing the room . Yes . And the clock 's working again ! - Still here ? - Yes . Of course they 're working - I make all clocks work ! Come on . It 's gone now . Get it off ! Quickly ! - Where , Dad , where is she ? - Where do you think ? Is it still there ? No . It 's gone . - Where ? - In the cellar , of course ! Where 's Rob ? We 're waiting . I want Rob ! Your mother 's waiting for you , Rob . Dad , you and Mum couldn 't have been hiding down here . Why ? I 've been down here enough times since you ... since it happened . - So ? - I 'd have seen you , wouldn 't I ? No . But there are no places to hide down here . No , no places ... but there are ways . Now what is it ? ! - What do you mean , ways ? - Ways of hiding ! Oh ... I 'll show you . Aw ... What has the mean man done to you ? Made you cry ? It wasn 't locked before . Come on , Rob . By the wall . Lead ? - Lead 'll take care of you . - Lead ? Lead ? ! Don 't worry . OK ? It 's all right . It 's locked . It isn 't now .

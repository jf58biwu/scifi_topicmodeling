 Should I come out to find you ? Do you read me , Apollo ? Apollo . It 's an ocean of darkness . I can 't see a thing . It 's more dangerous than a Cylon outpost - the biggest magnetic sea I 've ever seen . - A magnetic sea ? - A void . We couldn 't scan the other side . This disease has affected every pilot and half the bridge officers - everyone who 'd been in contact with anyone at that party . I can 't isolate it . The viper 's the most advanced flying machine ever . You don 't just turn one over to a shuttle pilot ! I want you to get them combat-ready . - You 're not serious ? - I 'm deadly serious . Ah , don 't force it . Remember , you 're flying a viper . Just think what you want it to do . - We 're about to be married ! - What does that have to do with it ? Your own sister 's a pilot and a warrior . She 's not my wife-to-be ! 'Stand by to launch probe . 'Core systems transferring control . Launch when ready . ' Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET - Oh , felgercarb ! - Easy , Brie , I got him . Commander ? Blue Squadron reports mission successful , no casualties . Good . As soon as the squadron has landed , order all ships to close on the Galactica and slow down to probe speed . - We 're not going into the void ? - The void may give us some cover . By your command . Everything is still proceeding according to my plan , except you have not captured one of their pilots as I ordered . To assure such a capture , we would have to risk being discovered . They send out patrols , do they not ? Capture one ! 'There are those who believe 'that life here 'began out there , 'far across the universe , 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans . 'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens . ' Navigation reports - instruments fluctuating from magnetic interference . - Commander ? - Steady on course . Distress signals from the Rising Star and the Edena . Half the fleet is panicking , sir . If they drift off , we 'll never find them . Order all captains to maintain visual contact on the Galactica . All right , make it brief . ( Beeping ) How do you feel ? I heard about what you did . Thanks . How do you feel ? Awful . But it beats being dead . For all we know , the void could be endless . The Book Of The Word tells us that a great star guided the Lords of Kobol away from the dying planet , across an endless black sea . The void ? Adama , there are probably as many voids in the universe as there are ideas . Old friend , this simple medallion is the symbol of my power . But it is also the symbol of our faith , handed down by the Lords of Kobol through the millennia to each member of the Council of 12 . With all our magnificent machinery , can we turn our backs on the inspiration which delivered our people once before ? - This round 's on me ! - All right ! Did you see what Deitra did ? - It was incredible . - What happened , Deitra ? Well , when I broke over their launch bay , there were two rising on Apollo 's tail . Apollo , what do you plan on doing for living quarters after you 're married ? Oh , I am so excited . I found a place in the Astrodon freighter . With a little paint and some nice curtains , it 's so cosy ! You 're so good with colour . In the shuttle , I only pulled about two Gs . But when I was on my own ... ( Women chatting and laughing ) You 'll never believe what I found . I just found some Valcron in the tip barge . Really ? - The soft , translucent kind ? - Absolutely stunning ! There were vipers and Cylons all over the place . And I was afraid to fire a laser in case I would hit one of you . ( Chatter continues ) Apollo , Starbuck . You 're not feeling left out , are you ? Oh , no . What would make you think that ? Commander , could you take a look at this ? - What is it ? - I don 't know . It was there behind us and then it was gone . Field looks clear to me now . Now it does but every once in a while ... There ! Look ! - Meteorite track ? - It 's always in the quadrant Delta 9 . If it 's a meteorite , it 's following us . Cylons ? There 's only one way to find out . Stay beyond scanner range . Our objective is to capture one of their patrols . - Hey , slow up , you guys . - This is confidential. it 's a mission . - You 've got the wrong pilot . - Wrong pilot ? I 'm Apollo 's wingman . Where Apollo goes , I go . - I don 't think you understand . - Adama 's orders , it 's been posted . That 's posted ? I didn 't look . I just assumed . I mean ... That 's fine . I 'd rather spend the next few centons in the bar picking up pointers from those hot pilots . - Colonel ... - Proceed to the launch bay . - Your coordinates are programmed . - Have a nice mission ! - Starbuck ! - I think we hurt his feelings . We don 't have time for this . There are targets trailing our fleet . - Where 's he going ? - Why ? He 's going the wrong way if he 's going to the Officers ' Club . - Starbuck , this is Captain Apollo 's ship . - Yeah , we switched patrols . Launch when ready . Transferring control to intercept 1 . Launch when ready . Starbuck . - He 's violating orders . - He 's protecting us . Wait a minute . I 'm your wingman . - I 'm his wingman ! - I know . I know . Serina ! Intercept 2 , acknowledging coordinates . - Launch . - Launch when ready . Commander , intercepts 1 and 2 are launched . - Only there 's ... - Only what ? There are three ships in the air . If you get too far ahead of me , you 're gonna lose your fix . Now slow up and give me a chance to catch up . Get your tail back aboard the Galactica . Is that any way to talk to an officer ? I 'll have you up on charges . Or locked out of my chambers . Serina , you 're a good pilot . My head believes that even if my stomach doesn 't . But this void can swallow up good pilots . - Apollo . - ' Yo . ' Whatever the Galactica picked up on her scanners is beyond our range . I could lose my fix on the Galactica . - Then go back . - ' I got a better idea . ' I 'll keep my fix on you , you keep your fix on the home base . - We can double our range . - I have a better idea . Apollo can lock on me , I 'll fix on the Galactica and we triple our range . - Who was that ? - Nobody . Just come back . If anybody 's going on deep probe , it 'll be me . Sorry . Consider it a wedding present . - Starbuck . - Starbuck ! Switching off of you for a microcenton to scan ahead . Stand by . Galactica patrol entering quadrant . Stand by to intercept . Targets . I 'm practically on top of ' em . I 'm leaving the void and ... Uh-oh ! I am on top of ' em ! - ( Interference ) - Apollo , I 'm in trouble . Repeat , Apollo ... Say again , Starbuck . You 're breaking up . I cannot read you . Starbuck , do you read ? Do you read ? Come in ! Frack . I like the way you haven 't gone overboard on furniture . Thanks . It will go better for you if you 'd show a little respect . You mean things could get worse ? Mmm . Lieutenant Starbuck . - How nice of you to drop in . - Baltar ! I 'd trade my life for one shot at you . Understand that I had nothing to do with the defeat of the Colonies . - I , too , was a victim . - Yeah , you look like one . There have been changes in the Cylon Empire , changes favourable to humans and their predicament . You 'd know a lot about that . Don 't antagonise me . I come to bring an offer of peace to all humans . These people are our friends . Really ? Then you won 't mind my leaving with the good news . In time . Remove him . See that he 's fed and made comfortable . Torture won 't do you any good . I had a course in resisting . Hey , careful . I bruise easy ! ( Sniggers ) This is your plan ? To convince the humans that we come bearing the twig of peace ? Yes . You cannot assume they would ever trust you again . You underestimate the human need for hope . Properly presented , and at a propitious moment , they 'll come willingly to my arms . How long will you watch for him ? ( Sighs ) I just can 't believe he 's gone . Apollo . I loved him too . That 's why I think he 'd understand . Even approve . Understand ? Approve what ? Apollo , marry me now . Now ? - Right in the middle of ... - Of what ? A disaster , a void , an endless night ? I don 't care . I don 't want to wait for a moment which may never happen . Do you love me ? Is that what it would take to prove it to you ? I just want every moment we have left before another centon passes , another mission where I might lose you . ( Weeps quietly ) Will the protector of Serina consent to relinquishing his responsibilities to Apollo , the man to whom she has consented to be married ? Yes . The words I 'm about to speak ... are the most powerful in all the universe . They seal a union between this man and this woman ... which is not only for now but for all the eternities . Apollo , Serina , under the eyes of God , bound by the symbol of the faiths of the Lord of Kobol , I declare you sealed . A star . A star ! - What is it ? - It 's a star . What is it , Colonel Tigh ? - Where are we ? - Is it the end of the void ? - It 's hard to believe . - Believe it . Believe it ! it 's the end of the void ! Tigh , initiate a search for a planet , elliptical orbit , one to three parsecs from the star . - A planet ? - If I 'm right , the planet Kobol . Kobol . Yes . The mother world of all humans ... where life began . ( Apollo ) incredible . ( Serina ) Beautiful . ( Engine rumbling ) We have a better chance of being alone here than in the fleet . Lieutenant , we 'll set up camp on the hill and post a guard , please . Against what ? I thought this planet was supposed to be dead . Yes . Yes , it 's supposed to be . But post a guard . A curious development , Your Eminence . This one will , I am sure , take you by surprise . Nothing takes me by surprise . What is it ? - A star . - What star ? A star has appeared as if out of nowhere and has guided the Galactica to a dead planet . Surely Adama knows I 'm closing for the kill , why would he ... ? A star , you said ? Of course . The endless black void and the majestic star in the heavens . ( Sniggers ) The trap is about to be sprung , my good friend . And now it will be all too easy . - Prepare my craft . - And an escort ? - I go alone . - Of course . Only I can bring the Galactica to your leader . Of course . ( Serina ) I wonder what the city was called . ( Adama ) There were many cities here on Kobol . Eden was the largest . It was the first to fall . This ... this might be it . I don 't know . ( Apollo ) I can 't read any of it . ( Adama ) I know. it 's difficult . But I 've been spending so much time with the old records . For example , that . That refers to the Ninth Lord of Kobol . That 's his seal . He was the ... the last ruler before the 13 tribes migrated to the stars . - 12 to settle our Colonies . - That 's why you entered the void . You think you can find the clue to where the 13th tribe went ! " Beyond this portal " lies the Ninth Lord of Kobol " in eternal peace . " Enter upon pain of death . " Your medallion . - It 's the same . - Yes . The seal of the ancient Lords . ( Gasps ) ( Heavy thud ) ( Serina gasps ) Who were they ? Tomb robbers . Must be . - ( Rumbling ) - ( Serina screams ) No . The laser blast would bring the ceiling down upon us . Commander . We must be near the sacred chambers . ( Apollo gasps ) I know exactly how you feel ... old friend . Baltar . No , Father ! - ( Choking ) - Leave him to the Council ! You almost killed me . - What is this madness ? - You need to ask ? - Selling out your own flesh and blood ? - Selling out ? What has he told you ? What great truths has Adama spoken to my back ? You didn 't destroy our fleet , our cities , almost every living thing in the Colonies ? Are you completely mad ? What sane human being would do a thing like that ? Adama , surely you have not supported such lies ? How could you think me so evil ? I , too , hold the Seal of the Lords , am a member of the Council of 12 . I was as much a victim as any of you . I lost everything , my family , my people . I was trapped between the President 's battlestar and my own . Captured by the Cylons , taken away like an animal to face trial ! Apparently they found you innocent , a friend of the Cylons . No . I was spared to lure you into another trap through a message of peace from some new and more benevolent Cylon ruler . - Get him out ! - Adama , wait ! You must hear me out . I have been to the Cylon seat of power . It is in chaos . The Cylon forces are searching for you throughout the star system . The route back into the Cylon Empire is barely defended . One single battlestar could take control of the Empire and bring it to its knees ! You have the tongue of an angel and the soul of a serpent . I can prove my good intentions , that I have the power to lead you back into Cylon , supposedly as my prisoners but in actuality to launch a counterattack against those demons . - What proof ? - The release of one of your officers . Lieutenant Starbuck . - He 's alive . - Let me show you . At what price ? - Remove him , Apollo . - What if he can prove what he 's saying ? If they 've sent him , then it is a trap . Then why haven 't they attacked ? I cannot tell you . But our safety is not behind us with you or the Cylons . It lies somewhere out there along the path taken by the 13th tribe . - The one that colonised the planet Earth . - Earth ? You can 't be serious . That 's only a fable . I believe it is as real as the existence of the 13th tribe . And the key to that tribe is here in this place , locked away somewhere . I 'm certain of it . Just getting the feel of it , Centurion . What have you to report ? Two Centurions have escorted the prisoner to the surface but there is no word from Baltar . A pity . I 'm afraid Baltar 's plan has failed , whatever that plan truly was . A pity . His instructions were quite specific , to stand by to escort the Galactica back to Cylon . Yes . The thought that intrigued me was just who was to be whose prisoner . The orders were quite specific . They were to be our prisoners . Oh , you Centurions are so limited in your appreciation of the human mind . I 'm afraid even our imperious Leader underestimates Baltar . The Leader and I are of the same series , you know . The IL group . Why he was chosen over me I 'll never understand . But it 's just possible ... that a major military victory under my command ... What is your command ? Hmm ... Oh . Just thinking out loud . ( Sighs ) The old writings ... they have him beguiled . He sits up there in the temple waiting for I-don 't-know-what . Apollo , those scriptures sent us here . No , a burned-out sun led us , nothing more . All right , dear " Practical " . Isn 't it comforting to know there 's more to life than a burned-out star and ruins ? - ( Gasps ) - Hi , how are you ? Starbuck ! ( Laughs ) - Starbuck ! - Starbuck ! Ah , missed me , did you ? - I guess you did . - Hey , everybody , it 's Starbuck ! - He 's back . - ( Apollo laughs ) Hey , it 's against regulations to hug a junior officer . Unless you mean it . We thought you were dead . What 's a little base star to an old warjock like me ? - Base star ? - There 's a base star coming ? Not coming , waiting . For orders . Didn 't Baltar show ? He got me free . - A base star ? - Cylons here ? He 's come to offer peace . Do you believe it ? We better leave the planet before his forces get here . Start breaking camp . Where are you going ? Baltar , I want some answers . - You 're coming with me . - Ah . Starbuck has arrived . Good . - I told you to send him to the Galactica . - I was afraid to send him . You should see his effect on our warriors . - We can 't expose him to the Council . - I can handle it . Can you handle the Cylon base ship ? There 's one just beyond scanner range . We must leave while the star is dormant and the magnetic field can hide our escape ! We cannot leave . Adama , listen to reason . You could drift forever in search of what ? A planet that may be the myth of half-drunken star voyagers who died here ? We could all die here , unless I give the appearance that I 've delivered you . We must attack and seize power . - It will take them completely by surprise . - I trusted you once . I cannot stay here too long before my machine friends will become nervous and do something rash . Is it me or is the room getting light ? It 's the star ! it 's pulsing again . It 's as if that window were placed precisely in that position for a reason . - The medallion . - Keyed by the star . ( Grinding ) Baltar , wait ! Baltar , don 't touch that ! Baltar ! - The Ninth Lord of Kobol ! - Don 't touch it ! How dare you defile the holy crypt ! I don 't believe in primitive superstition . ( Rumbling and crashing ) - I didn 't mean it ! - ( Crashing ) it 's blocked ! Out ! I want out ! Stand aside ! It was a mistake ! I meant no harm ! Adama , the Lords are with you . Use your power . Get us out of here ! I cannot . - Apollo ? - I 'd say they 're using 50 megon loads . ( Screams ) Cylons ! Take cover ! - ( Screaming ) - Get down ! Get to your vipers ! - Athena , where 's Apollo and Serina ? - Up at the temple with Baltar . They 're gonna blow that place to pieces ! The only way to get ' em down is to knock ' em out of the sky . Are you crazy ? You barely know how to fly ! - You do what you want to do ! I 'm going ! - Wait ! Lord help us . ( Screaming ) Watch out , Deitra ! Take cover ! ( Panicked shouting ) if I get my hands on you , Lucifer ... Adama , do something ! Give me the torch . Quickly ! All right , fly in pairs . Wingmen , stick to your leaders . Protect them . - We may have a chance . - Starbuck , we 'll ionise them ! The angle of deflection on incoming Cylon fighters indicates an attack on the surface of Kobol . And all of our warriors are down there . Not all of them . Colonel , Blue Squadron reporting for duty , sir . Lieutenant , obviously you can 't even stand . A viper is flown from the seated position , sir . ( Starbuck ' They 've seen us ! ' ( Athena ) ' 80 , 90 , 100 . ' Athena , quit counting . You 're not on the bridge . Let 's go get ' em ! Jamie got hit ! Watch out ! Brie , there 's one on your tail ! Breaking ! It 's hopeless , Starbuck ! Deitra , roll ! Roll ! - We 're trapped . - Let 's go out fighting . Launch vipers . Transferring launch control . Launch when ready . Launching . Jolly . - On your wake . - Let 's go . Serina . Apollo . This is what we came for . This is a record of the Exodus , the final departure of the first 12 tribes , the ones which eventually became the Colonies we knew . And here , the last days , the final days of Kobol . - It tells of the 13th tribe . - Can you tell where they went ? ( Thunderous crashing ) - ( Groaning and coughing ) - ( Explosions ) - ( Rocks falling ) - ( Groaning ) ( Spluttering ) The door ! - It 's been blasted open . - The writings ! - ( Baltar ) Forget the writings . - They 're gone . - Help me ! - We 'll be gone if we don 't hurry ! Somebody help me . Here . There they are . Blue Squadron , let 's go join the party . - I 'm in trouble . - ' Hang on , Starbuck , I 'm coming . ' - You better hurry . - Jolly , this one 's mine ! Yeee-haa ! I got two lined up ! ( Grunting ) The pillar is just too great ! Father , we must get out before it comes down on us ! No , you can 't leave me here . Baltar , we 're left with no choice . Your ... your friends have sealed your fate and ours . Lucifer ... I 'll tear you apart limb from limb , circuit by circuit , so help me ! You have not heard the last of Baltar ! Colonel , combat report coming in . " Surprise total - Cylons running . " Shall we pursue ? Boomer . " Negative . Bring them home . Any word from the Commander or Apollo ? No , sir . ( Coughing ) The camp has been obliterated . It doesn 't mean they didn 't get away . Starbuck ! - What happened ? - We lost good pilots . - Athena ? - She 's with the rest of the squadron . Colonel Tigh wants to get underway . The Cylons will be sending reinforcements . Yes . Yes , we must get off the surface quickly . Come along . Look out ! ( Screams ) - Serina . - ( Groans and chokes ) ( Gasping ) Serina . Serina . Mama ... I hear you won the whole war . I had a little help . You 're going away , aren 't you ? Yes , Boxey , I am . But your father will be there to love you and ... and take care of you . And I 'll love you always . You won 't forget that ? ( Boxey sniffs ) ls that any way for a junior warrior to act ? That 's better . That 's much better . It isn 't fair to you . To me ? If I could trade places ... I just want you to know ... that I feel very , very lucky . Even if all we had was a brief time , it will be worth an eternity . We will have an eternity too . - Do you believe that ? - You 've convinced me . A spirit like yours just can 't end . I love you . I love you . - I don 't want her to go ! - I know . But it 's her body that 's gone , Boxey , not her spirit . Or her love for us . We 'll have that always . Forever . I guess I won 't make a very good warrior . You 'll make a fine warrior . Come on , son , let 's go . ( Adama ) ' Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny , 'the last battlestar , Galactica , 'leads a ragtag fugitive fleet 'on a lonely quest - 'a shining planet 'known as Earth . '

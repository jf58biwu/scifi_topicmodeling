 ( HORSES APPROACHING ) There must be somewhere suitable . Whoa . How about over there ? Well , it could be . Here . Got to find somewhere before dark . Yes . Here . Right , let 's go . - Seems fine , eh ? - Yes . - Not just for a night 's shelter either . - Hmm ? Give it a bit of fiddling , I reckon I could get this lot working . Hey ! You mean re-shoe Jasper ? I might manage it . A botched up retread job at least . Must be something to match his hoof size around here . Certainly save your shoe leather if you could . Exactly . - Just one thing . - Hmm ? You 're not chewing anything this evening on account of this here is reserved . - For ? - Cooking ! Oh , that 's better . - Lucky find . - Handy for the horses , too . ( BIRD SCREECHING ) Odd there aren 't more settlements around here . You don 't think ... Shh ! ( SCREECHING ) ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) MAN : Hello in there . - Who are you ? - Travellers . - How many ? - Two . In friendship . No weapons . - Are you well ? - Yeah . Quite well . Show yourselves , please . Kim . Nancy . Greetings in love , brother . Welcome . Saw the fire . Welcome . We 're Charles and Pet . She 's dumb . All right if we kip in with you then , share the fire ? - Why not ? - Get the cart , kid . Good place . Yes . As long as it doesn 't rain . There 's also a forge to re-shoe the horses . - You 've got horses ? - Yes . We 're on our way back to our settlement a couple of days south of here . Where are you from ? Around . I was in Birmingham at first . - Then ... - What was it like , in the city ? All right at first light , once you got used to the smell , great . But ? Had us a load of gear stored away , didn 't we ? Plenty of stuff . Some kids got onto us . - Kids ? - Did us over , see . - Oh , that 's tough . - ( SCOFFS ) That 's the town . So , then you decided to try your luck in the country ? Some luck . Oh , why haven 't you tried to join a settlement ? That 's not our bag , is it ? Well , it 's better than just wandering around , surely ? Yeah . Like that mob down the road ? - What mob ? - About five miles , that way . - How many ? - Never had time to find out , did we ? We left in a bit of a hurry . Surely , with a limp like yours , you can 't afford to be choosy . Not us . Them . Don 't want to know . Just dirty hippies , that 's what we are to them . Don 't want to know . I see . Would you like a little meat ? Rabbit . I think we might manage them a little salt too , eh , Pet ? KIM : Great . Salt ! - Hey , where 'd you get it ? - Old place up near Chester . Natural brine ponds . It 's just lying there thick as syrup in these caves . - Yeah ? That where you been ? - Yes . We thought we had enough . But you get through it fast when you preserve with it . Here . - What happened ? - You what ? Has Nancy always been mute like this ? Not like when we first met up . No , not then . Had this nipper , didn 't she ? Little baby boy . Rats got it , didn 't they ? - Oh , no ! - They 're packs of them , see . In the town . Hunt in packs . - I 'm sorry . - Leave her . Don 't need your pity . We 'll make out , see . ( CHARLES SIGHS ) Oh ! - Fleas ? - Mmm . ( SIGHS ) Oh , well . I suppose we could hardly bar the door to them . I suppose not . They 've had it , haven 't they ? I mean , they can 't come to us . ( KIM GROANING ) CHARLES : Hmm . PET : It 's so ironic . Survived the Death itself and then go under with the shock . Yes . Except there 's no need . - I wouldn 't give this couple very long . - Oh , I don 't know . Given the right help . ( KIM GROANING ) But we 're not on this trip to pick up deranged vagrants . ( RETCHING ) Lord , what now ? Poor devil . ( KIM RETCHING CONTINUOUSLY ) The way they both gulped down that stew , it 's hardly surprising . Burning ... ( KIM RETCHING LOUDLY ) Easy now . What 's the matter ? Lungs , throat , burning ... Quickly . Try and get them to drink as much water as possible . - But , Charlie ... - Quickly . I saddle up the horses . - What , and leave them ? - No , no , no , no . Take them to the settlement he mentioned down the road . - In the dark ? - Oh , come on . It 'll soon be light . Well , come on . ( GROANING ) This must be the place . We 're nearly there . ( LOW GROWLING ) Hold it . - Hello , there . - What are you after ? - Well , we want some help , actually . - Keep back . Uh , look , it 's all right , but we met this couple , you see . And you can see for yourself what state they 're in . - Get going . - Oh , now wait . You heard . They 're ill . Had them crawling around here yesterday . - Get . - They could die . Better them than us . - Now , listen ... - Look . Haven 't you got some sort of quarantine quarters or something ? Sure . But not for filthy scavengers like them . We 've got something to trade . We can pay for the help . - Pay ? - Yes . With salt . For mercy 's sake . All right . But you two , you 're in quarantine with them . Anything . The isolation hut . Over there . - You got a doctor ? - That depends . Depends . Depends on what ? The committee . It 's like a palace . It makes our quarantine quarters look a bit scant . - They 've got paraffin , too . - Yes , and water . Get them to drink as much as we can . Here . You hold them . Come on , sit up . Now , drink . - Swallow . Swallow , come on . - Come on . See what they 've got over there . Come on . Penicillin , tetracycline . Drink . - Various ointments , ear and eye drops . - Drink it all . Drink it all . Well , over cautious or not , they 're certainly well organised . ( NANCY CRYING IN PAIN ) One , two , three . One , two , three . Toes . Again . Again . Lunge . Push . Again . Again . And ... Down . Swing . Heave . And rest . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) Well , Leonard , let 's have it . Well , they say they 're from a settlement to the south of here . Seems they were camped down the road and these two termies pitched up . Around dawn , the termies got sick so they brought them down here . - That was presumptuous . - Sir . But why , Lenny ? You know the rules . Why 'd you allow them in ? Well , they 've got salt . Really . - Yes , we wondered . - Of course , as soon as I heard that ... So , what 's up with these two termies ? - They 're both in a bad way . - We 'll go and check . - And take care . - Yes . Of course . Lenny . - Is your settlement south of here ? - Yes , that 's right . Where 'd you get all this salt ? ( CHUCKLES ) That 's a trade secret . What 's the matter with these two termies you brought in ? - The what ? - Termies . Terminals , zombies , vagrants , dropouts , whatever you call them . Oh , uh , I should say from the symptoms , the way it suddenly hit them , food poisoning . - Are you two all right ? - Yes . Any idea what they were eating ? ( NANCY GROANING IN PAIN ) A stew of some kind . They had a cart with them yesterday . Where is that ? There 's some outhouses a way up the road . We 'll check . ( NANCY SCREAMING IN PAIN ) Would you have a medical adviser of any kind ? No . For pete 's sake , be quick . Gone ? What do we do ? There 's not much we can do , is there , stuck in here ? Damn these people . Why ? We 'd do the same thing . - Would we ? - In these circumstances , yes . You can 't take health risks . Nobody coming in and infecting an entire settlement . Burn it . ( STRUMMING ) - Electric . - Come on , Sammy , hurry up . - Oh , no . - What 's the matter ? That 's it . Some of our seed wheat . From the store ? - Well ... - Well , from where ? - Was it in the store ? - No . I left it in the shed . In the little one out by the planting field . And now ... Oh , dear God ! It 's all right , Sammy . For once , you made the right mistake . - She 's dead ? - Yes . What about him ? - Seems to be just a shade better . - No . We 've been forcing him to drink as much water as possible . Seems to help . - Not for long . - What do you mean ? They stole some of our seed wheat . It 's dressed with mangano oxide powder . - It 's a fungicide containing mercury . - Oh , my God ! According to our medical books , if his heart 's strong enough to withstand the initial shock , he 'll die of a kidney failure within a fortnight . - Now , if you 'd like to come with me ? - Where ? Oh , we find you somewhere a bit more civilised . You both look as though you could use a hot bath . - Well , I ... - Well , come along , then . Oh , wait a minute . What about him ? - Lenny will look after him . - Yes . How ? I imagine a strong pain killer would be the most effective treatment , Lenny . - Right . - Come along . - All right ? - PET : Hmm ! Bliss . - Nice and warm , is it ? - Ooh ! Lovely . I 'll get these sewed up for her . - You have a shoemaker ? - Among other things . How are yours ? Oh , they 're fine . Thank you . Well , you the boss of this outfit ? Mr Kershaw is our leader . Max Kershaw . - Ah . Well , I hope we can meet . - Well , of course . You 're obviously very well organised . We accept the need for total discipline . - Yes , it shows . - Your late breakfast . Oh , looks like real five star stuff , eh ? Hello . Thank you very much . My name is Charles Vaughan . - Sammy Waters , sir . - Thank you , Sammy . Well , that looks good . - Home brew ? - Yes . - For you ? - No , thank you . Oh , that 's very good . - We are pleased with it . - Mmm . I 'm sure . - Like everything else around here . - That 's right . Except , perhaps , for salt . We 're a long way from the coast . It is a problem . Well , perhaps it might prove some catalyst for some form of collaboration , eh ? Mr Kershaw may consider trading , I don 't know . - Oh . Well , why not ? - Our ideal is total self-sufficiency . Well , it 's fine for a start , but ultimately ... What ? Well , long term survival against external threats and so on is going to depend on inter-settlement cooperation . - You believe . - Well , yes . I don 't just mean some sort of Federal Home Guard or militia , though that 's pretty crucial , there are lots of other aspects . - Such as ? - The need for communications either by connecting telephone wires or some form of shortwave radio . - Lots of other mutual aspects . - Like ? Well , one settlement could specialise in large scale soap production and another one could go in for burning charcoal . The industrial revolution . So soon . Well , it doesn 't have to be big to start with . I mean , you 've got a shoemaker . We have a doctor . ( TAPPING GLASS ) You make very good wine . - We have a salt source . - Where ? ( CHUCKLES ) - You take me to your leader . - All in good time . When you 're all cleaned up and presentable . PET : We have been on the road almost a week , you know . I can believe it . He 's almost as high as those termies . PET : Towel , please . Excuse me . Well , what system do you follow here ? - System ? - Your social organisation . The new way of truth . ( LAUGHING ) Oh ! And what 's that ? Foundation of the family as a unified group . No crude subdivisions like individual marriages . We 're dedicated to the disciplines of purity , selective procreation . - Physical development . - All this is new ? - Yes . - Oh , I 'm sorry . The reason I said that is because , well , apart from the eugenics bit , it sounds a bit like the old kibbutz system . Mr Kershaw had studied that , of course . You 'll find we 've greatly improved on it . Oh . Well , as I said , " Take me to your leader . " - So , he 's a bit of a joker , is he ? - Hardly . - What sort of a man is he ? - I don 't think he has personal ambition . - They never do to begin with . - And their horses are in good shape . One needed a shoe , but otherwise ... So he understands husbandry . I should hope so . - That hardly proves anything . - Of course not . I just thought ... Apart from all this crud about collaboration , what did he say about the actual settlement ? I suppose they have marriages and individual families . - I 'm afraid so . - Peasants . - You can 't expect anything else . - Change terrifies people . What did he say about their work schedules ? What did he say about that side of it ? To each according to his ability , to each according to his needs . The old Marxist philosophy of imagined equality . - MAN : You 'd think they 'd learn . - Old habits die hard . But they must know about the Death . It was the communists who manufactured it , released it on the world . - Surely ... - But there are some people , most people , you could show them something as glaring as day against night , and they 'll still deny it . You see , change , anything new , is instantly rejected . - Hopeless . - Yes . I don 't think they 'll want to stay too long . - Good riddance . - Hear , hear . Yes . But we must find out where they get the salt . - Agreed . - Also Vaughan 's anxious to meet you . To seduce me to federation , no doubt . - Oh , for pete 's sake , Pet , relax . - I can 't . Look , you 've had a hot bath , you 've had good grub , you 've had wine , what more do you want ? To get going . All right . But the horses could do with the rest . I 'll make arrangements to leave at first light tomorrow . You can 't wait to have a go at their leader , can you ? Well , I won 't deny a certain curiosity . More than that . You want to recruit him , don 't you ? Well , you must admit , wouldn 't be a bad settlement to join up with . All right , they 're a bit far away from us , but with a communication system ... - Huh ! - Oh , Pet , it could work . I wouldn 't like to bet . - Why not ? - I don 't know . There 's something creepy . Oh , nonsense . Listen , while you were sleeping just now , I was watching their field workers coming in for lunch . - So ? - They were marching . A dozen people in a nice , neat column . Left , right , left , right . Halt ! So what ? The woman , Joy Dunn , she made no bones about it . She said they all accepted the need for total discipline . Even so , marching your field workers ? A bit extreme . We 're in an extreme situation , all of us . Well , we don 't march anywhere . Would it do any harm if we did ? Where are you going ? Wanna see if there is a chance of getting old Jasper shod . Let 's leave , Charlie , please . Let 's go . Look , even if we 're agreed on that , you know very well we can 't . What ? Why ? You know very well why . That woman took your boots . - Can I help you ? - Ah , just gonna check the horses . No need , they 're fine . Really ? Because the big white fellow was losing a shoe . That 's right , sir . The groom fixed it . Ah . - Well , I 'll just take a look . - I told you , no need . - Shouldn 't you be tending the sick ? - Ah , well , there 's need for that either . - What do you mean ? - He snuffed it . - Now , damn it ! If you ... - No , nothing like that . He simply crept out the hut , tried to make off with one of the horses . You 're not serious ? Serious for him . The dogs got him . Once again , Lord , we thank thee for preserving us from the Death plague . By which thee in thy infinite wisdom sought to purge the world of sin , ignorance , lust , sloth and corruption . Guide us thy people , Lord . Show us who have been chosen , chosen to survive the holy Death . Show us the ways of thy eternal wisdom . Amen . ALL : Amen . Thank you . Now , unfortunately due to our visitors , I must ask the members of the committee to forego their evening activities , but just for a while . The rest of you , please continue . Max . See the man on his own . You 're more likely to get information from him . The woman is antagonistic . Damned people . Oh , come on . We don 't know they mean us any harm . No ? What about that gangster Lenny , you said he made it perfectly clear . Only that I had a notice to stay clear of the horses , that 's all . - There you are . - Maybe it 's just him . Maybe it 's just his manner , maybe he 's just officious . Damn fascist . - Oh , nonsense , love . - Is it ? Look , a fascist , you should have met that lot we ran into in London . Well , I didn 't . And this lot frightens me . Well , why ? They haven 't disarmed us , we still got the gun . - Yeah , sure . But they 've got my boots . - For repair . All day ? ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Well , how are you feeling ? Had a good rest ? - I want to know where ... - We 're fine . Thank you . It 's just that Pet 's a wee bit anxious about her boots . - Anxious ? - Well , it 's just ... The shoe-man 's gluing on new soles . They 'll be ready in the morning . Oh . Now , if you 'd like to come and meet the committee . - We won 't keep him very long . - What about Pet ? She 'll be perfectly safe . The night patrol 's on duty . Eventually , I hope you 'll be able to address the whole community . Perhaps in the morning . But that will depend on Mr Kershaw . Go on . There 's a bolt . ( DOG BARKING ) The discipline of procreation . Which amounts to what , a programme of eugenics ? As I explained to you this morning , yes . The controlled breeding of a master race ? - The world has to be repopulated . - As a matter of urgency . Oh , I couldn 't agree more . I 'm just a little suspicious of the way you 're going about it . It would be criminal folly to resume mating on a random basis like before . - Really ? - Of course . Now that we have the opportunity for planning and selection . Yes , but how do you plan ? How do you select for the ideal offspring ? The community decides . Ah . - By general consensus . - It 's a lot better than your system . - You think so ? - Marriage , individual family units . - All part of the old way . - Which indisputably failed . - Oh , come on ... - Of course it did . Man 's genetic history , Mr Vaughan , was a disaster . Persistent decline both physically and intellectually . Civilisation , so called , simply perpetuated the survival of the weakest . Which is why the Death became inevitable . Mankind had failed . And a new way had to be found . Ordained by God . Are you saying that the Death was an act of God ? The eradication of 98 % of the human race can hardly be shrugged off as a random act of destruction . There has to be a higher purpose behind it . A meaning . Well , one can of course read a divine intent into it . Can ? - Must . - Well , all right ... A new way has to be found , Mr Vaughan . It is the clear duty of those of us chosen to survive . - Duty . - Chosen . - You disagree ? - Of course we must try and build again a new society , one which won 't make the same mistake . But from what sub-leader Dunn tells us , your methods are those of the old world . - With modifications . - From each according to his abilities , to each according to his needs , hardly modified . - The old impractical communism , in fact . - Not exactly . But what 's your answer ? - Discipline . - Dedication . As the chosen . What about these ideas of yours for inter-settlement collaboration ? - What about them ? - Old ways again . - Oh , come on ... - What 's so new about federation ? There 's nothing new ... You admit that is your ultimate aim , a federation ? Yes , via trade and a pooling of resources . Aggression . You call it collaboration , to us it 's pollution . - With what ? - Old world ideas . Creatures like those two filthy termies you brought in here . - You associated with them . - Voluntarily . We could hardly do anything else . They found our camp , they asked to share our fire and our shelter . - We could hardly turn them away . - DUNN : No ? Unlike you lot , apparently . - We have a right to protect ourselves . - Those two were finished . Degenerate , filthy deranged scavengers . - Not chosen ? - No . - Fit only for destruction ? - For their own self destruction . Ah , yes , except that your thug Lenny took it on himself to accelerate the process , your so-called pain killer solution . The man was dying anyway . Oh , is that another one of your new ways , euthanasia . Is that why there are no old people here ? Or cripples . Priorities , Mr Vaughan . You must accept that survival of the fittest is a priority . Yes , along with your other fascist priorities . Like eugenics and group isolation . They are necessary . Look , I hope to learn something from you people . Some disciplines to benefit my own settlement . - Well , you have nothing . - Sit down . We have stability . We have efficiency and purpose . You have a police state in embryo . Guns , drilling , uniforms ... We have no frontiers , Mr Vaughan . Anyone can leave if he so wishes . You telling me they don 't ? Mostly , those who have chosen to leave have been back within a week . Begging to be allowed back in . Begging . Well ... Well , all I can say is , by comparison with us , you 're far too extreme . Too advanced , I think . Few can adapt to change easily , Mr Vaughan . I 'm talking about qualities you 've lost . Qualities like love , human charity . You can 't exclude compassion . You must tolerate some failure . No . That is precisely why it all failed before the Death . Through weakness , through a criminal liberalism which tolerated sloth and greed and ignorance . Then we have no mutual interests . Don 't forget your salt source , Mr Vaughan . I 'm sorry , but as long as you insist upon this policy of isolation , it 's quite out of the question . - You might trade . - Oh , that 's no good . Look , why don 't you let me put my ideas to the rest of your community . - Why ? - Why not ? You say you 're not oppressive , you 're not a police state . All right , let me at least try them . If so , it will have to be at assembly in the morning . Very well . Then tomorrow morning , at assembly . Chosen ? By divine right ? Well , that 's how at least one of them , a very pregnant young lady on their committee , that 's how she sees them . - And Max Kershaw , their leader ? - Ah , well , he 's less of an evangelist . He just reckons the whole world was incurably bent . - What are you doing ? - Going to bed , what else . - Bed , surely ... - Ah , relax , love . Look , they don 't mean us any harm . It might be a virtual dictatorship , but at least it 's a benevolent one . Take them to the woman now , Max . Tell them to go . - Well , I thought you wanted to ... - That was only for the committee . We can 't risk letting this man talk to them . His ideas are dangerous . - Trade and federation ? - Yes . This community believes it 's special . They are the chosen . That policy will only work in isolation , Max . Our whole system depends on it . But they believe in this system , they 're not going to believe him . I 'm not so sure . Their moods have been changing . We 've had a good harvest . Plenty of meat on the hoof , wine in the vat . No more shortages or hunger . They 're beginning to question us , Max . The discipline , the hard graft . They want things easier . - I think you 're mistaken . - I 'm closer to them . I 've heard the whispers , seen the discontent . - Why haven 't you mentioned it before ? - I was controlling them . Now , this man with his obsession about unity . We can 't risk letting them hear him . Forget the salt , Max . Just get rid of them . ( DOG BARKING ) Did you hear that ? Oh , Pet . They did murder that poor devil Kim . ( CHARLES SIGHS ) They put him out of his misery . You 're beginning to sound like them , you know that ? Well , perhaps they 're right about being chosen . Perhaps we were chosen . You and me and Greg . - And all the others . - Amen . ( KNOCKING ) - Who 's it ? - Kershaw . Let me in . Here . Thanks . Put them on , take your things and go . Now , please . The patrol won 't harm you . Why , Kershaw ? Because I can 't let you face the assembly . - You decided I 'm a bad risk ? - Will you just go ? Afraid your people might prefer my ideas ? I 'm afraid for you , as it happens , for your safety . Oh ? They believe in me , they believe in everything that we 're working towards . - The new way . - The new way , that 's right , yes . If I let you speak at the assembly , if I let you speak about your damn federation , it 's a heresy against everything they believe in . I can 't answer for them , I don 't know how they might respond . - A lynching ? - I 'm just saying there 's a danger . You really got them so conditioned ? So ruled by your propaganda ? Hate the termies . Fear outsiders to the point of tearing them limb from limb . They might demand your execution . I don 't know and I can 't risk it . No , you can 't . But it 's not our future you 're concerned for , Kershaw . - It 's yours . - Go . I wasn 't prepared for this , you know . Before the Death , I was a school master teaching in Liverpool . What I 'm trying to say is that I had strong feelings about discipline and self sacrifice and all that sort of thing . But I wasn 't prepared for leadership . But they have chosen me as a leader . And I 've grown to understand them . So , I 'm telling you now , for your own sake , to go . Right , let 's go . - Charlie ! - I simply don 't believe him . Does it matter ? Does it ? Look , I 've seen them in that big hut there , you haven 't . I 've seen the marching bit , that 's enough for me . But that 's it ! They 're disciplined , they 're not a mob , not a rabble . Neither were the Nazi minions at Nuremberg . - Oh , come on . - It 's no different . Conditioned by extremes of propaganda . It 's the " them and us " syndrome . Except that we are not that far gone . We were fanatics at first . All of us . You remember those months after the Death ? The anarchy , the terror . The dreadful deprivations , the gang rapes . And then to find someone like Max Kershaw . Strong , morally strong . The new messiah . Of course we followed him . And now ? Now it 's the old power complex . He 's afraid of losing his grip . Which is what is driving him to these new extremes . - Such as ? - What Mike told you earlier on , about people running away . It was a put-up job . Trusted men like Lenny , selected to run away . And then come back with tales of persisting anarchy and terror outside . - Oh , that 's cunning . - Yes . Sustain the myth . The " them and us " syndrome as you call it . Which is precisely why he can 't risk letting you talk to them . Letting you tell them the truth . Why he prefers you dead . - What ? - You imagined he 'd simply let you go ? - Why not ? - I 've told you . Extremes . He sees you , your ideas , as a sickness , as a disease . If he were to let you go , you 'd spread the word around the other settlements . And once you 'd organised your federal militia , you 'd be back in strength . Oh , but damn it . That 's not what federation is about . It is to Max Kershaw . It 's a direct threat to his supremacy as leader . - That 's insanity . - So was Adolf Hitler , insane . Walk through that door tonight and you 're both dead . Murderers . ( DOG BARKING ) Keep the door bolted . Your gun at the ready . I can save you . At assembly tomorrow , follow my lead . I can sway them . But I need your cooperation . ALL : Amen . KERSHAW : Thank you . This man Charles Vaughan is from a community to the south of here . Now , he holds certain beliefs which , although alien to our ideas , may be of interest to you . Consequently , I call on sub-leader Dunn to examine him on those beliefs . Mr Vaughan . I advised you to go . I think you might regret that you didn 't do so . Mr Vaughan . Now then , Mr Vaughan , I believe you have certain criticisms of the way this community is organised . Yes ? Yes , I feel that compared with us , I feel you 're too extreme . How exactly ? I think you could be carrying discipline to dangerous lengths . Only in the interests of survival , I assure you , Mr Vaughan . However , let us examine this accusation . It 's hardly an accusation . You say , as I understood you last night , you say we 're becoming depersonalised . That in functioning as a group family , that is free of individual marriages and so on , we may be losing certain human qualities . Yes ? CHARLES : Yes . Qualities such as love and compassion ... - And narrow prejudices . - Possibly . You also condemn our programme - of eugenics . - I question it . And you claim that our policy of euthanasia is cruel . When it 's applied to old people and the infirm , to cripples and so on , yes . You condemn our choice of non-cooperation - with outside settlements ? - Most definitely , yes . So , what 's wrong with the ideal of self-sufficiency ? Nothing for a start . As the population grows and stability is re-established , then inter-settlement cooperation must follow and the sooner we can start ... You see , Mr Vaughan , your criticisms would carry more weight if they were borne out by your own actions . - I 'm sorry ? - You associated with those two termies . What 's wrong with that ? They needed help . You brought them here . You deliberately exposed this community to what might have been a contagious infection . - But you 've got quarantine facilities . - But you didn 't know that . If this is an example of what you mean by cooperation ... Simple compassion , human charity ... Not if we had been infected . What you did was criminal . A callous disregard for the safety of these people . ( PEOPLE CLAMOURING ) - Look , what is this ? A trial ? - No , Mr Vaughan . Merely an enquiry and your criticism of this community . - Well , then ... - You must see that by associating with those termies , you exposed yourself to their physical infection - and to the degeneracy of their minds . - Those two ? Proof that no matter how innocent your intentions , you must ultimately fail , be dragged down to their level . Look , you may not call this a trial , but that 's what it 's turning into . - If I 'm not to be allowed to justify ... - Well , maybe it is a trial . - Why ? - Because I , as leader , want it so . Because I suspect that your presence here isn 't what it seems . What do you mean ? Oh , it 's not the chance intrusion , Mr Vaughan . It 's not the Samaritan mission it appeared to be . Oh , no . That aspect of it was only an opportunity which you ceased upon to your own advantage . To my own ... What other motive could I possibly have had ? The deliberate subversion of this community . ( CROWD CHATTERING ) - Well , that 's insane . - Ridiculous . It 's not how our leader regards it . Max Kershaw is a man of vision . He knows the truth . Really ? Well , if you ask me , all he knows is fear . Fear for his position as leader . You say that , he doesn 't . He says this community is unique . That we have a mission to find the new way , that we are chosen . Chosen by the divine authority of God . - ALL : Hear , hear ! - Isn 't that right , Max ? And you , you were chosen by God to be our leader . - No , Joy , I never claimed ... - No ? Don 't you have divine authority ? Aren 't you free to disregard compassion ? To condemn human charity as weakness because he who speaks for God must be right ? - No , Joy , this is absurd . - Yes . Yes , it is , because it 's a lie . - And everything you stand for is a lie . - What are you talking about ? Discipline , he told you . Purity . Hate the degenerates outside because only we know the way . He is degenerate . He has lied to you , he has resorted to criminal deceits . No , she 's mad . Don 't you listen to her . Do you deny plotting to kill these two people last night ? - Do you ? - Well , of course I deny it . Did he come to you ? Did he urge you to make a run for it ? Did he ? - Yes , he did . - You heard him . And I was to be their executioner . Oh , this is a fabrication , every single word of it ! Lenny , you were on duty . Did you see him ? - No . - At least let him answer . Did you see our leader go to their hut last night ? Yes or no . Yes , yes he went there . Well , it was her idea . Mine ? You 're the leader , you give the orders . But she urged me to warn these two off . Max , please , no more lies . He 's afraid . Afraid of letting you listen to this man , terrified of your learning the truth about the outside . No ! No ! Listen to me ! For some reason she is trying to deceive you . He is a liar ! This man has just lied to you all along . Jack , Fiona , Lenny , when you ran away and came back , was that all a put-up job ? Was it ? Lenny ? - Yes , yes , it was . - And you two ? - But you were party to that . - Only because you ordered it . Now , now he resorts even to murder . These two people whose only crime was to question his power over you . Now , listen to me . All of you , listen ! Now , she talks of power . She is the one who is after power . Can 't you see ? DUNN : All right ? PET : That depends . DUNN : On ? What you 've got planned for Max Kershaw ? - The firing squad ? - We 're not barbarians . The usual penalty is banishment . - He is far more use to me here . - Hmm ? He 's been discredited . I shall appeal for clemency . The new regime is much more humane . He remains here as proof of that . Hey ! - Where 's the salt ? - I gave it . - What ? - Forget it . - You gave it to them ? - I wanted to get away . She set us up , didn 't she ? Used us . Yes , Kershaw was becoming increasingly more extreme , power going to his head . He was a threat to their future survival . Hers you mean . Didn 't you notice ? All the other women were either pregnant or suckling . Well , if nothing else , it qualifies her a true survivor . And a sure-fire candidate for your first federal prime minister ! ( CHARLES LAUGHING ) Well , she 's certainly a politician . And they are always the survivors .

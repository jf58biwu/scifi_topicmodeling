 [ Rhythmic Droning ] [ Rattling ] [ Humming ] [ Electronic Chittering ] [ Clacking ] [ Distorted Computer Noises ] [ Noises Stop ] [ Chattering , Indistinct ] The food is terrible . Worst shit I 've ever seen , man . [ Parker ] What you say ? You got any biscuits over there ? [ Ripley ] I keep seeing corn bread . - I am cold . - Still with us , Brett ? - Right . - Oh , I feel dead . Anybody ever tell you you look dead , man ? [ Mouthing Words ] [ Parker ] Oh , yeah , right . Now , I just forgot something , man . Before we dock , I think we oughta discuss the bonus situation . Right . Brett and I , we think we oughta - - We deserve full shares , right , baby ? - You see , Mr. Parker and I ... feel that the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level . Well , you 'll get what you 're contracted for like everybody else . Yes , but everybody else gets more than us . [ Monitor Beeping ] Dallas , Mother wants to talk to you . Huh ? Yeah , I saw it . Yellow light 's for my eyes only . Okay , get dressed , huh ? Parker , come on . Can I finish my coffee ? Thank you . It 's the only thing good on this ship . [ Chattering Continues ] [ Buzzes ] [ Beeping ] [ Clacking ] [ Electronic Chittering ] [ Dallas ] Morning , Mother . [ Beeping , Whirring ] [ Voice Over Radio , Indistinct ] - Right . - Okay . Plug us in . Thank you . - Where 's Earth ? - You should know . It 's not our system . Scan . [ Sighs ] I can 't believe this . Contact Traffic Control . [ Ripley ] This is commercial towing vehicle Nostromo out of the Solomons . Registration number : 1-8-0-niner-2-4-6-0-niner . Calling Antarctica Traffic Control . Can you read me ? Over . Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo out of the Solomons , registration number - Nothing . [ Kane ] Keep trying . Calling Antarctica Traffic Control . Do you read me , Antarctica ? Over . I found it . Just short of Zeta II Reticuli . [ Ripley Chattering On Radio ] We haven 't reached the outer rim yet . That 's hard to believe . [ Lambert ] What the hell are we doing out here ? I don 't know . What the hell are you talking about ? - That 's not our system . - I know that . [ Loud Rumbling ] [ Parker ] Do you ever notice how they never come down here ? I mean , this is where the work is , right ? Well , it 's the same damn reason we get a half share to their one . Our time is their time . That 's the way they see it . No , but - Listen , man . Same old shit , man . I think I know why they don 't come down here . It 's because of you . You don 't have no personality . Wonder what they want now . What 's going on down here ? Um , you happen to be in my seat . Can I have it ? Yes , of course . Thank you . I 'm sorry . [ Wiping ] [ Parker ] What 's happenin ' now , baby ? Well , some of you may have figured out we 're not home yet . - We 're only halfway there . - What ? Mother 's interrupted the course of our journey . Why ? Yeah . She 's programmed to do that should certain conditions arise . They have . [ Ripley ] Like what ? It seems she has ... intercepted a transmission of unknown origin . She got us up to check it out . A transmission ? Out here ? Yeah . What kind of a transmission ? Acoustical beacon . It repeats at intervals of 12 seconds . S.O.S. ? I don 't know . Human ? Unknown . [ Brett ] Well , so what ? [ Kane ] We are obligated under section eight - I hate to bring this up , but , uh , this is a commercial ship , not a rescue ship . Right . And it 's not in my contract to do this kind of duty . And what about the money ? If you wanna give me some money , I 'll be happy to oblige . The man 's right . Let 's go over the bonus situation . - I 'm sorry . Can I say something ? - Let 's talk about the bonus more . There is a clause in the contract which specifically states ... any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin ... must be investigated . I don 't wanna hear it . We don 't know if it 's intelligent . I wanna go home and party . Parker , will you just listen to the man ? On penalty of total forfeiture of shares . No money . You got that ? - [ Chuckling ] Well , yeah . - All right , we 're going in . Yeah . We 're goin ' in , aren 't we ? [ Clears Throat ] Can we all hear that , Lambert ? [ Beeping ] [ Electronic Pulsing ] [ Pulsing Continues ] [ Scoffs ] Good God . Doesn 't sound like any radio signal I 've heard . Maybe it 's a voice . Well , we 'll soon know . Can you hone in on that ? What was the , uh , position ? 6550-99 . [ Beeping ] [ Clacking ] [ Beeping ] All right . It found the quadrant . Ascension : six minutes , 20 seconds . Declination : 39 degrees , two seconds . Okay . Put that on the screen for me . [ Lambert ] All right . Well , that 's it . It 's a planetoid . 1200 kilometers . It 's tiny . Any rotation ? [ Beeping ] [ Lambert ] About two hours . What about gravity ? Point eight-six . You can walk on it . [ Lambert Over Radio ] Approaching orbital apogee . Mark 12 , 11 - Equatorial orbit nailed . [ Lambert ] Nine , eight seconds on descent . [ Kane ] Grids energized . Fields focused . Five . Four - [ Dallas , Indistinct ] - D.O.R. ' s on line . - How 's the status on the lifters ? Give me an A.C. pressure reading . Forty-eight seconds and counting . [ Ripley Over Radio ] SR-1stable . Prepare to disengage from platform . [ Lambert ] Mark , 20 seconds . Eighteen , 17 - Twelve , 11 , 10 , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one , lock . Disengage . [ Ripley ] Umbilicus clear . Money 's safe . Let 's take her down . [ Parker ] Nine , eight , seven - [ Kane ] Roll 92 degrees port yaw . [ Ripley ] Prime to port . [ Ripley ] Prime ventral . Prime dorsal . [ Kane ] Down a degree . [ Lambert ] 39,000 meters . [ Dallas Over Radio , Indistinct ] [ Ripley ] Turbulence . [ Voices Over Radio Continue ] Locked and floating . You can drop us anytime now . We 'll catch you . Inertial damping 's going off . Hold on , people . There 's gonna be a little bump . [ Metal Creaking Loudly ] What the hell was that ? Pressure drop in intake three . Must 've lost a shield . Let 's go with it . [ Voices Over Radio Continue ] [ Grunts ] Dropping off now . Still dropping . Here we are . We 've got it . Take her down . Navigation lights on . [ Ash ] We 've got 5-3 still out . No problem . Just down 11 % . Grid status okay . [ Lambert ] Nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Kill drive engines . [ Alarm Blaring ] What the hell happened ? [ Alarm Blaring ] Somebody give me a straight answer ! - Is the hull breached ? - I don 't see anything . We 've still got pressure . - Hit the screen . - Right . [ Wind Howling ] [ Parker Over Radio ] Secondary load sharing unit ... is out . Three to four cells are gone . Is that it ? No , hold on . We can 't fix it out here anyway , and we need to reroute ... a couple of these ducts , wouldn 't you say , Brett ? Dry dock time . Dry dock . Tell her we need to dry-dock . Look , we couldn 't fix it out here anyway . We gotta reroute all these ducts , and in order to do that we 've got to dry-dock . [ Sighs ] What else ? [ Parker Over Radio ] Some fragments kicked up , and we 've got to clean it all out and repressurize it . [ Ripley Over Radio ] How long before we 're functional ? Look , what is - What - It 's 17 hours , tell her . At least 25 hours . Yeah . [ Ripley ] Get started on the floor panel . I 'll be right down . What the hell 's she comin ' down here for ? She better stay the fuck out of my way , I 'll tell you that . I 'd like to see what she 's gonna do when she gets here . [ Wind Howling ] Any response yet ? [ Ash ] No . Absolutely nothing . Except the same transmission every 12 seconds . All the other channels are dead . [ Clicks Switch ] Kick on the floods . We can 't go anywhere in this . Mmm . Well , Mother says the sun 's coming up in 20 minutes . How far are we from the source of transmission ? Uh , northeast . Just under 2,000 meters . Walking distance ? [ Laughs ] Well - Can you give me an atmospheric ? Yes . [ Ash ] Oh . It 's almost primordial . There 's inert nitrogen , high concentration of carbon dioxide crystals , methane . I 'm working on the trace elements . Anything else ? Yes . It 's ... rock , lava base , and deep cold . Well below the line . Mm-hmm . [ Kane ] I 'll volunteer to be in the first group to go out . [ Dallas ] Yeah , that figures . You too , Lambert . Swell . [ Dallas ] Better break out the weapons . [ Wind Howling ] [ Lambert ] I can 't see a goddamn thing . [ Dallas ] Ash , are you receiving ? [ Voices Over Radio , Indistinct ] [ Mouths Words ] [ Ash ] Good contact on my board . [ Dallas Over Monitor ] Clear and free . Keep the line open . Let 's go . Hey , Ripley . Hey , Ripley , I wanna ask you a question . If they find what they 're lookin ' for out there , does that mean we get full shares ? Don 't worry , Parker . You 'll get whatever 's coming to you . Look , I 'm not gonna do any more work ... till we get this straightened out . Brett , you 're guaranteed by law to get a share . [ Parker ] What ? - Why don 't you just fuck off . - What ? [ Brett ] What 'd you say , Rip ? If you have any trouble , I 'll be on the bridge . [ Parker ] Hey , Ripley , come back here ! [ Chuckling ] Son of a bitch . What 's the matter ? [ Lambert ] Can 't see a goddamn thing . [ Kane ] Quit griping . I like griping . [ Dallas ] Come on . Knock it off . [ Clacking ] [ Respirators Hissing ] Ash , can you see this ? Yes , I can . I 've never seen anything like it . [ Dallas ] Very bizarre . [ Kane ] You said it . [ Dallas ] All right . Moving on to second ... position . [ Lambert ] What is it ? Let 's get out of here . [ Kane ] We 've got this far . We must go on . We have to go on . Will you say that again ? Shit . [ Dallas ] Ash , as you can see , it 's kind of hard to describe . I 'm going back to the console . [ Voices Continue Over Monitor , Distorted ] [ Dallas , Faint ] Seems to be solid . To walk - You can on it . [ Dallas Continues , Voice Distorted ] [ Dallas Continues , Indistinct ] Dallas ? [ Respirators Hissing ] Come on down here . Something different down here . I don 't know what it is , but - See if we can get up that wall . If we can get up that wall , we can find out . Amazing . [ Dallas ] Alien life-form . Looks like it 's been dead a long time . Fossilized . Looks like it 's grown out of the chair . Bones are bent outward , like he exploded from inside . [ Lambert ] Wonder what happened to the rest of the crew . Let 's get the hell out of here . Hey , Dallas , Lambert , come on over here . Come on . What do you got ? See what you make of this . [ Clicks Switch ] Ash . That transmission - Mother 's deciphered part of it . It doesn 't look like an S.O.S. What is it , then ? Well , I - It looks like a warning . I 'm gonna go out after them . What 's the point ? I mean , by the time it takes to get there , you 'll - they 'll know if it 's a warning or not , yes ? [ Clicks Switch ] [ Exhales Deeply ] [ Dallas ] You okay down there ? Can you see anything ? Uh ... a cave . A ca - A cave of some sort . But I - Well , I don 't know , but it 's like the goddamn tropics in here . What the hell is this ? The cave is completely enclosed , and it 's full of ... leathery objects , like eggs or something . [ High-pitched Humming ] There 's a layer of mist ... [ High-pitched Tone ] just covering the eggs that reacts when broken . [ Dallas Over Radio ] Kane ? You all right ? I 'm okay . All right . I 'm okay . I just slipped . Appears to be completely sealed . [ Hisses ] Wait a minute . There 's movement . It seems to have life . Organic life . [ Screeching ] [ Wind Howling ] [ Computer Clacking ] [ Dallas Over Radio ] You there , Ripley ? I 'm right here . [ Beeping ] Okay , Ripley , I 'm at the inner lock hatch now . Right . Ripley . We 're clean . Let us in . Right here . - What happened to Kane ? - Something has attached itself to him . - We have to get him to the infirmary right away . - What kind of thing ? I need a clear definition . An organism . Open the hatch . Wait a minute . If we let it in , the ship could be infected . You know the quarantine procedure - 24 hours for decontamination . He could die in 24 hours . Open the hatch . Listen to me . If we break quarantine , we could all die . Look , would you open the goddamn hatch ? We have to get him inside . No . I can 't do that . And if you were in my position , you 'd do the same . Ripley , this is an order . Open that hatch right now . Do you hear me ? Yes . Ripley , this is an order ! Do you hear me ? Yes , I read you . The answer is negative . Inner hatch opened . [ Whirring ] My God . What the hell is that ? Jesus Christ . What is that , man ? Hey , how the hell is he breathing ? Is he still alive or what ? Why don 't you guys freeze him ? How come they don 't freeze him ? What 's going on in there ? What the fuck is going on ? You bitch ! Jesus Christ ! Hey ! Hey ! You would 've left us out there . Break it up . [ Dallas ] Ripley , when I give an order , I expect to be obeyed . Even if it 's against the law ? You 're goddamn right ! Maybe she has a point . Who the hell knows what that thing is . How are we gonna get that off him ? How are we gonna get it off ? I 'm gonna get some instruments . My God . Right . I 'll make an incision here . Try and remove one of the digitals from - You 're gonna do what ? Finger . I 'm gonna try and get his finger off . Just a minute . [ Continues , Indistinct ] No , that 's not - It 's tearing his scalp . I know ! It 's not coming off without tearing his face off with it . We 'll have to take a look at him inside . Right . How come they don 't freeze him ? [ Parker Shouting ] How come you guys don 't freeze him ? All right , you can take your mask off . - What 's it got down his throat ? - I would suggest it 's feeding him oxygen . Paralyzes him , puts him in a coma , then keeps him alive . Now what the hell is that ? We gotta get it off of him . Just a minute . Just a minute . I mean , let 's not be too hasty . We don 't know anything about ... it . Now , we 're assuming it 's feeding him oxygen . If we remove it , it could kill him . I 'm willing to take that chance . Let 's cut it off him now . You 'll take responsibility ? Yes , I 'll take responsibility . Get him out of there . [ Dallas ] Where do you wanna do this ? We 'll make an incision just below the knuckle there . Right here . Stand by . [ Whirring ] [ Ash ] Good God ! [ Dallas ] That crap 's gonna eat through the hull . That thing 's gonna eat through the goddamn hull . Come on ! What 's going on ? This way . Next deck . - [ Sizzling ] - [ Parker ] There it is . Don 't get under it ! Don 't get under it . Looks like it 's stopping . Take a look at this , man . Yeah . Brett , give me - What do you got , a pen there ? Give it to me , quick . Come on ! Come on ! [ Brett ] Don 't get any on your arm . It stopped . Don 't see anything like that except , uh , molecular acid . It must be using it for blood . It 's got a wonderful defense mechanism . You don 't dare kill it . What about Kane ? - Here 's your pen back . - [ Brett ] What do we do now ? Leave Kane to Ash . You get back to work . Well , what - [ Electrical Crackling ] Okay . Try it . [ Motor Cranking ] Damn it . I thought sure that was it . Try it again . [ Cranking ] I feel like I 've been in this place a month . We shouldn 't have landed in this place in the first place . Shouldn 't have landed on this damn ball , I know that . Well , the sooner we patch this thing up and get out of here , the sooner we can go home . This place gives me the creeps . [ Ripley ] That 's amazing . What is it ? Ah , yes , it is . Um - I don 't know yet . [ Coughs ] Did you want something ? Yes . I , uh - I 'd like to have a little talk . How 's , uh - How 's Kane ? He 's holding . No changes . And , uh , our guest ? Well - Hmm ? Well , as I said , I 'm still ... collating , actually , but , uh , I have confirmed that he 's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides . He has a funny habit of shedding his cells ... and replacing them with ... polarized silicon , which gives him a prolonged resistance ... to adverse environmental conditions . Is that enough for you ? That 's plenty . What does it mean ? Please don 't do that . Thank you . I 'm sorry . Well , it 's an interesting combination of elements , making him a tough little son of a bitch . And you let him in . I was obeying a direct order , remember ? Ash , when Dallas and Kane are off the ship , I 'm senior officer . Oh , yes . I forgot . You also forgot the science division 's basic quarantine law . No , that I didn 't forget . Oh , I see . You just broke it . Huh ? Look , what would you have done with Kane ? Hmm ? You knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here . Unfortunately , by breaking quarantine , you risk everybody 's life . Maybe I should 've left him outside . Maybe I 've jeopardized the rest of us , but it was a risk I was willing to take . That 's a pretty big risk ... for a science officer . It 's , uh , not exactly out of the manual , is it ? I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you , you know . You do your job ... and let me do mine , yes ? [ Wind Swirling ] ♪ ♪ [ Classical ] [ Ripley ] Where 's Dallas ? [ Ash ] In the shuttle . ♪ ♪ [ Continues ] [ Beep ] [ Clicks Switch ] Dallas .

Dallas , it has to go back . Well , I 'd soon ... as not burn it at the stake , but you 're the science officer . It 's your decision , Ash . Dallas . How come I 've got to change my mind ? The decision 's been made . I 'm not trying to change your mind , Dallas . I just want you to listen - Will you listen to - [ Groans ] Just tell me how you can leave that kind of decision to him . Look , I just run the ship . Anything that has to do with the science division , Ash has the final word . - How does that happen ? - It happens , my dear , because that 's what the company wants to happen . Since when is that standard procedure ? Standard procedure is to do what the hell they tell you to do . What 's happening with the repairs ? How 's it going ? They 're pretty much finished now . Why the hell didn 't you tell me so ? - Because there 's still some things left to do . - Like what ? Well , we 're blind on " B " and " C " decks . The reserve power system 's blown - That 's a bunch of horseshit . We can take off without that . Yeah , we can . You think that 's a good idea ?

Yeah . Anything ? No . You ? Nothing . You see anything ? No . [ Loud Clank ] [ Dallas ] Inner hatch sealed . Anybody wanna say anything ? This is just an ordinary prod , like a cattle prod . It 's got a portable battery . It 's insulated all the way here , all the way up to here . Just make damn sure nobody puts their hand on the end of it . It shouldn 't damage the little bastard , unless its skin 's thinner than ours . But it will give him a little incentive . Now we just have to find it . I 've taken care of that . I 've designed this tracking device . You just set it to search for a moving object , like so . Hasn 't got much of a range , but when you get within a certain distance , it 'll start to give off a signal . What 's it key on ? Micro changes in air density . Give me a demo . [ Whirring ] See ? Again . Got ya . Two teams . Ash , Lambert and I . Ripley , you take Parker and Brett . Now , anyone see this thing , you catch it in the net ... that Parker 's holding on his lap . Parker , I don 't want any heroics out of you , all right ? Catch it , put it in the air lock , get rid of it . Now , channels are open on all decks . I want you to communicate , keep in touch at all times , all right ? Let 's go . I thought you fixed 12 module . [ Brett ] We did . I don 't understand it . [ Parker ] The circuits must have burned out . What do we got here ? Damn it ! Hold your light over here , would you ? Yeah , that 's it . I don 't know if this is gonna work . If I could just put this - put this in there . Right . Oh , damn it . Check the insulation . Oh , shit ! [ Tracking Device Whirring ] Steady . According to this , it 's within five meters .

Whatever it was , it was - it was big and - You 're sure it took him into the air shaft ? Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts . No question , it 's - it 's using the air ducts to move around . Could he want Brett alive ? What ? Could Brett be alive ? No . I mean , I don 't think so . Well , this air shaft may work to our advantage . Here it leads up to and comes out in the main air lock . All right . There 's only one big opening along the way . We can cover that up , and then we ... drive it into the air lock and zap it into outer space . This son of a bitch is huge ! - I mean , it 's like a man . It 's big ! - Kane 's son . Come on , Ash . Science department should be able to help us . What can we do to drive it ? Yes , well , it 's adapted remarkably well to our atmosphere , considering its nutritional requirements . - The only thing we don 't know about is temperature . - Okay . What about temperature ? - What happens if we change it ? - Let 's try it . I mean , most animals retreat from fire . Yes ? Fire , yeah . Parker , can you rig ... three or four incinerator units ? Give me about 20 minutes . I 'll do it . - Who gets to go into the vent ? - I do . No . You and Ash ... take the main air lock . Parker , Lambert , you cover up that maintenance opening , please . [ Lambert ] Right . [ Beeping ] - [ Dallas ] I 'm at the first junction . - Dallas , I 'm right here . - Parker ? - Yeah ? - Lambert ? We 're in position . I 'm just trying to get a reading here . - The air lock is open . - Okay , Ripley . Ready . All right . I 've got a reading on you now . [ Tracker Beeping ] Uh , open the hatch to the third junction . [ Beeping ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Dallas ] Okay , I 'm through . Ripley ? Yes . Close all the hatches behind me . I 'm moving on . [ Lambert ] Dallas , hold it a minute . I think I got it . Yes , I 've got it . [ Dallas ] Where ? [ Lambert ] It 's somewhere around the third junction . Okay , moving on . It is right around there . Now , Dallas , you 're gonna have to be careful . All right . I 've reached ... the third junction , and I 'm going down . [ Sensors Beeping ] [ Beeping ] The hell 's the matter with that box ? Dallas , you 're gonna have to hold your position for a minute . I - I 've lost the signal . What ? You sure ? Look around . Are you sure it 's not there ? It 's got to be around there somewhere . [ Dallas ] Checked it out , Lambert . You may be getting interserence . [ Lambert ] Dallas , are you sure there 's no sign of it ? I mean , it is there . It 's gotta be around there . - Dallas ? - God , what is happening ? All right . Uh , am I - am I clear , Lambert ? I want to get the hell out of here . [ Beeping ] [ Lambert ] Oh , God . It 's moving right towards you . Um - Move ! Get out of there ! Behind you ! Move ! Dallas ! Move , Dallas ! Move , Dallas ! Get out ! [ Sobbing ] Move ! The other way ! [ Screeching ] [ Shrill Feedback ] Dallas ? Oh , no . Take it easy . [ Parker ] Dallas ? We found this laying there . No blood . No Dallas . Nothing . How come I don 't hear nobody saying nothing ? I 'm thinking . Unless somebody has got a better idea , we 'll proceed with Dallas 's plan . What ? And end up like the others ? Ohh . No , you 're out of your mind . - Got a better idea ? - Yes . I say that we abandon this ship . We get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here . We take our chances and just hope that ... somebody picks us up . Lambert . The shuttle won 't take four . Then why don 't we draw straws and - I 'm not drawing ' any straws . I 'm for killing that goddamn thing right now . [ Ripley ] Okay . Well , let 's talk about killing it . [ Parker Grumbling ] We know it 's using the air shafts - Will you listen to me , Parker ? Shut up ! Let 's hear it . Let 's hear it . It 's using the air shafts . We don 't know that . That 's the only way . We 'll move in pairs . We 'll go step by step ... and cut off every bulkhead and every vent ... until we have it cornered , and then we 'll blow it the fuck out into space . Is that acceptable to you ? If it means killing it , it 's acceptable to me . Obviously it means killing it . But we have to stick together . How are our weapons ? The weapons are fine . This one needs refueling . Will you get it , please ? Ash , go with him . No , no . I can manage , Ash . Don 't follow me . Ash ? Any suggestions from you or Mother ? No , we 're still collating . [ Laughs ] You 're what ? You 're still collating ? I find that hard to believe . What would you like me to do ? Just what you 've been doing , Ash . Nothing . I 've got access to Mother now , and I 'll get my own answers , thank you . All right . [ Clicking , Beeping ] [ Whirring ] [ Keyboard Beeping ] There is an explanation for this , you know . Is there really ? I don 't wanna hear your goddamn explanation ! [ Sobbing ] I want - I want - [ Sobbing ] I want - I w - Parker . Lambert ? Ash , open the door . Ash - Will you open the door ? Let me by , Ash . [ Giggling ] [ Screams ] [ Jingling ] Yaah ! [ Groans ] [ Muffled Shouts ] The hell are you doing ? [ Muffled Shouting Continues ] Aah ! Get her up . Get her up . Get her up . Get her up . Get her up . Get her up . [ Chittering ] Android ! He 's an android ! [ Screeching ] Jesus ! [ Parker ] It 's a robot . Ash is a goddamn robot ! God ! [ Parker ] Oh ! Get off me - Oh ! Holy shit ! Help ! Help me get this fucking thing off ! [ Screaming ] Aah ! God ! Jesus ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! [ Parker ] How come the company sent us a goddamn robot ? [ Ripley ] All I can think of is they must 've wanted the alien for their weapons division . He 's been protecting it right along . Parker , will you plug it in ? [ Parker ] I don 't know why - Because he may know how to kill it . [ Ripley ] Ash , can you hear me ? Ash ? [ Distorted Voice ] Yes , I can hear you . - What was your special order ? - You read it . I thought it was clear . - What was it ? - Bring back life-form . Priority one . All other priorities rescinded . The damn company ! What about our lives , you son of a bitch ? I repeat : All other priorities are rescinded . [ Ripley ] How do we kill it , Ash ? There 's got to be a way of killing it . How - How do we do it ? You can 't . - That 's bullshit ! - You still don 't understand what you 're dealing with , do you ? A persect organism . Its structural persection is matched only by its hostility . You admire it . I admire its purity . A survivor ... unclouded by conscience , remorse or delusions of morality . [ Parker ] Look , I - I 've heard enough of this , and I 'm asking you to pull the plug . [ Ash ] Last word . What ? I can 't lie to you about your chances , but ... you have my sympathies . We 're gonna blow up the ship . We 'll take our chances in the shuttle . Blow up the ship . Good . Come on . When we throw the switches , how long before the ship blows ? Ten minutes . No bullshit . If we ain 't outta here in ten minutes , we won 't need no rocket to fly through space . We 're gonna need coolant for the air support system . You two go down , get all the coolant you can carry . I 'll get the shuttle ready . I 'll give you about - about seven minutes . Come back up here . I 'll shut the switches off , and we 'll blow this fucker off into space . Okay . All right . Come on . Ready ? Take care of yourself . Seven minutes . [ Typing ] [ Parker On Speaker ] Take it easy . [ Meowing On Speaker ] Jones . [ Cylinders Hiss ] Jones ? Okay , check the bottles . Jones ? How you doin ' ? Fine . Kitty . [ Tapping Fingers ] [ Parker On Speaker ] Okay . Go ahead . Jones ? Psst ! Psst ! Psst ! Psst ! Kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty . Come here , Jones . Come here . Jones ? Come here , boy . Come here . Nice kitty . Jones ? [ Rattling ] Jones ? Come here . Come here , sweetheart . Jones . Jones ? Jones ? Jones ? - [ Snarls ] - [ Gasps ] Jones ! Goddamn it ! Now I got you . Here , sweetie . Nice kitty . - [ Gasps ] - Oh , my God . [ Parker ] Get out of the way . [ Lambert ] I can 't get out of the way ! Get out of the way , Lambert ! It 's gonna kill us ! I can 't ! Lambert , for Christ 's sake , get out of the way ! Parker ? Lambert - Get out of the way , Lambert ! Parker ? Lambert ? Lambert ? Parker ?

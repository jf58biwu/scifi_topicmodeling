 You have been found guilty of treason against the state . Remove him . I know you . I remember that voice . Who was attacking us ? Starbuck , it 's so loud ! I can 't stand it ! The key is to be found in the crashed ship where you discovered Iblis . - What are you doing ? - Stay back ! - What is it you found ? - Don 't go in there . 'In part one of War Of The Gods ... ' Making the final sweep ... Bojay . - Lord , they 're fast ! - Wait , they 're moving up behind us ! Bojay ! They disappeared here , in this sector . - There 's been no transmissions ? - An automatic distress signal . Since then , nothing . Four ships have vanished . Was that a ship ? Yes , it was . It was destroyed . - By whom ? - The great powers . - You mean the Cylon Empire ? - No . I want a complete report on him from the life station . Cranium probe , neurosystems , everything , including psycho-electron recall . Your people will be safe ... under my leadership . But they 're so beautiful . Don 't be beguiled . Their glow conceals everlasting darkness . Look away , Sheba . - Who are you ? - I am of another world , a degree of being developed far in advance of your own . - How can you verify that ? - Prepare for me three tests . As I have the power to move that object , so I have the power to deliver your people . I will deliver your enemy unto you this night . Omega , bring the fleet to full alert . - Yes , sir . - What is it ? What 's happening ? I have just received a direct communiqu√© from Baltar . What ? Requesting permission to come aboard under a universal sign of truce . 'This is an event unlike any we 've experienced 'since the destruction of our civilisation . 'Baltar 's ship is approaching 'Word is spreading like sunbursts through every corner of the fleet . 'It 's a jubilation unprecedented 'as Baltar is brought before the Council of 12 . 'It is just as Count Iblis promised . 'Our enemy has been delivered . 'And now , the exciting conclusion of War Of The Gods . ' Baltar . You have been found guilty of treason against the state and in violation of every code of moral and ethical conduct known to man . You 're sentenced to spend the rest of your life in confinement aboard the prison barge . No , I say you can 't do this ! I came to you under a sign of truce ! You need me ! We need each other ! There is a power greater than the Cylon Empire ! It will destroy us all unless we unite ! May I address the Council ? Baltar . - Who are you ? - I 'm Count Iblis . I will lead these people away from your ruthless pursuit . That voice . There 's something about your voice . I 've heard it before . It is the voice of truth . It will lead these people as it has led you to surrender to their justice . I came here of my own free will . Just as you willingly drop to your knees to accept your punishment . Adama ! - Remove him . - Who is he ? You can 't ! You can 't do this to me ! I came here of my own free will ! There were to be two more elements to our bargain ... one , that I should lead you to Earth and the other was to be decided amongst yourselves . I remind you that the people are expectant . Now they rejoice in the fall of Baltar but soon they will demand that the journey to Earth begin . When you have decided , you will find me amongst the people in celebration . I believe we should all join in the celebration . And I see no reason to delay electing Count Iblis to the presidency of our quorum . Are there any dissenting votes ? If I may . It is true Count Iblis has done as promised . And as you said , Sire , it was inspirational . However , there are still questions unanswered , warriors who 've disappeared , disquieting events still to be studied . May I suggest adjournment until this time tomorrow ? Fair enough . The Council of 12 stands adjourned . Sit , Baltar . Do not pace . You . You ! Sit ... old friend . I will not . And you cannot ever again force me to do anything . I know you ! I remember that voice . Do you ? The voice of the Cylon Imperious Leader . - But the Cylons are machines . - Yes , now . But once they were a race of beings who allowed themselves to be overcome by their own technology . - And when did this happen ? - A thousand yahrens ago . At the onset of the Thousand-Yahren War against the humans . Then my voice would have to have been transcribed into a machine leader a thousand yahrens ago . I 'd have to be a thousand yahrens old . Do not fear , my friend . All is not lost . Please come with me . I want you to attend the games . I 've too much on my mind and I have decisions which I must make . You sound like Apollo . He 's decided not to play tonight . It 's causing dissension within the fleet . I didn 't know of his decision . Well , what do you know ? I 've been looking all over for you . Where have you been ? Boxey , hold it . Boxey ! Hey , I 'm talking to you . Since when do you just walk out of here without giving me a hug ? My friends all say you 're a coward . A coward ? What are you talking about ? They say you 're afraid to play in the games . Why would I be afraid ? We have the best team in the fleet . We can beat anybody . Count Iblis says that Boomer 's team 's gonna win . Since when does he know anything about triad ? My friends say you 're afraid if you lose , it 'll prove Count Iblis is smarter than Grandfather , that he should be our new leader . My not playing in the games has nothing to do with my father . It has to do with wasting my time , laughing and carrying on like nothing is wrong while friends of mine may be out there dying someplace . - Can you understand that ? - I guess so . Good . Tell your friends I said it doesn 't matter who wins . I 'd be just as happy to see Boomer win for a change . It isn 't easy , is it ? - No . - No . How can I explain my feelings to a child when I can 't explain them to myself ? I thought you did rather well . I 'm not sure I agree with you entirely . You , of all people , think I should play ? Will it serve any purpose for you to sit in your quarters and think about your missing friends ? Son ... don 't make it more difficult for me . And don 't leave me with 220 ships full of enthusiasts who are outraged because you didn 't show up to play . You 'd just be serving Count Iblis ' cause . He 's become quite popular . I think half the fleet would follow him now . Father , if you think my not playing will shift the balance his way , I 'll play . Well , I ... I don 't think you 'd be doing your missing friends a disservice . In fact , you may even be helping them . Sheba . Boomer . - Good luck . - You too . Well , so much for my moment of glory . Come on . Don 't give up before you 've begun . You are good . I am good , he is better . But I 'd give anything to beat him just once . I 'd heard you 'd felt that way . Maybe I can be of help . Nothing can beat skill , sir . The Commander 's son is a trifle too sure of himself . Maybe that weakness can be exploited . Obviously , you 've never played triad against Starbuck and Apollo . No , but I 'd like to - through you . How badly would you like to win ? Go ! Go ! Go ! ' .. a surprising early advantage . Loose sphere ! 'Apollo comes up with it ! Releases and misses ! ' Come on , Apollo ! Is it just me or does everyone seem especially festive that we lost ? I don 't remember anybody being this happy when we won . Including me . My dear young friends , there is a new air of optimism . Join in it . You look so serious . The games will be a distant memory before this night is through . How long is this party going to last ? These people are in critical jobs . Trust me to worry about the fleet from now on . My commandment is ... that everyone enjoy life to its fullest . No matter how long it lasts . Starbuck , Apollo , you just don 't seem to get the point . Look , we 're all saved , so relax . Oh , come on , Apollo . Let me offer you a little consolation . What a wonderful idea . They make a handsome couple . Really ? I , er ... somehow had the impression you were interested in Sheba for yourself . Why should she be limited to one man ? Or you and I to one woman ? Hm . I get the feeling I might like this place you come from . I can see you and I are going to be soul mates . - Let me offer you a drink . - I can 't see any harm in one drink . I 'm surprised you asked me to dance and not Count Iblis . Apollo , are you jealous ? Jealous ? Now , you hold it . Do you think I 'd let something as petty as jealousy interfere with my judgment when the lives of everyone here could be at stake ? Do you ? More of those unidentified ships ? They 're observing us or setting us up for something . Still nothing on the scanner ? Where 's Omega ? What 's happened to all our personnel ? Many of our personnel are on life station relief . Why hasn 't the chief life officer reported ? - He was one of the first stricken . - Stricken ? Quite simply , an overdose of pleasure . You can 't be serious . What about curfew for duty officers ? Apparently some leeway has been granted . - By whom ? - Count Iblis . Count Iblis . Launch a security screen . I want to see Iblis in my quarters . Sir ? Thus far , no pilots have responded to the alert . What 's going on here ? Get moving ! It 's a red alert ! Let 's go ! Everybody up ! Starbuck ? What 's going on here ? Wake up ! It 's a red alert . I don 't think everybody made it back to the Galactica . They 're spread all over the fleet . Get up ! Come on . Come on ! Get up ! Come on , take it easy . Gentlemen ! A disgraceful accounting of yourselves . The alert is fully 12 centons along . Not a ship is launched ! Why , you ... Release me , or forfeit your life ! Apollo , have you lost control ? Release him ! You have just saved your son 's life . If this is the way you run your ship , the Council may take up more than my ascension to the presidency . I may relieve you of your command as military leader as well . This may be of no interest to you but the fleet is under attack . Respond to the klaxon or I 'll have you arrested . Iblis ! Who is attacking us ? What are they ? What are you ? I have told you all you are capable of comprehending . For a man of such remarkable powers , you show very grave concern for those light forces observing us so closely . They , too , are from my dominion . - Then why do you fear them ? - I fear no man , no creature . Not even God ? What do you primitive children know of what you call God ? Only that we have been given laws which cannot be broken by any man or creature . - Those laws do not apply to me . - I wonder . Just where in Hades ' hole are you going ? Bandit at right centre . I 'm gonna get one of those white lights and make myself a fireball . See that ? I blew him right out of the universe . Boomer , he left you standing still . What 's that noise ? Starbuck , Apollo , do you read me ? Something 's coming up behind me . It 's so loud I can 't stand it ! - Starbuck , what happened to him ? - I don 't know . One micron he was on my scanner , the next he was gone . I mean , he just disappeared . Let 's get back and see what we 've got . Are you crazy ? What do you mean get back ? We can 't leave Boomer out here . He 's not out here . He 's someplace else . Someplace out of our reach . - They 're not necessarily hostile . - But we 've lost eight pilots . - They haven 't attacked the fleet . - So far . They 're studying our weaknesses , to find the best way to destroy us . If an attack is coming , there 's one person who knows about it and about these aliens . I say we dump him where we found him . He 's at the heart of this . - All our troubles began with him . - We can 't turn back time . Count Iblis is becoming very popular in the fleet . Soon the Council will elect him to the presidency . There has to be some way to stop that ! How ? He gives our people everything they desire . Hope , food ... And what is he looking for in return ? What price do we pay ? And what 's his connection with them ? There 's no question , they 've responded to some extraordinary influence . - Any ideas ? - Possibly . Come over here . Our normal seismic and cosmic monitoring went right off the chart yesterday and today . According to calculations from the bridge , those occurrences coincided with the presence of the unidentified ships . The ships gave off energy which influenced the growth of these plants ? Could have . It 's no different in principle to plants leaning towards and receiving energy from a sun . It was the ships rather than Count Iblis that caused the plants to multiply ? I said it 's a possibility . I sure like it better than the alternative . Thanks , Doc . Keep on it . Apollo , you 've got that look . What are you thinking ? Rest up . You 're still suffering from the party . I 'm gonna do some thinking . How did you do that ? It 's impolite not to make your presence known . I think I 've discovered how Count Iblis has been doing these miracles and then I see you do this . This was not a miracle . This is a simple test of mind over matter , long a key study of our military institute . I remember ... I used to drive your mother mad by bending eating utensils until she made me stop the practice . How come I never knew ? It was before you were born . It was in my early days at the institute , a special programme - strictly a military study . Our life expectancy now , Cylons notwithstanding , is about 200 yahrens . We 're just beginning to utilise some portion of our brain 's incredible potential . Now imagine ... imagine , if you will , a race of beings ... whose life expectancy is thousands of yahrens . A race of that kind would certainly have learned to do what we would consider to be miraculous things . That 's what you think we 're dealing with here ? With Count Iblis and these ... strange lights ? No , not lights . The ancient Lords who first settled on Kobol , spoke of visitations from what they in their primitive way referred to as angels . Angels ? Think of them as custodians of the universe ... advanced beings , very highly advanced , whose mandate it is to make certain that their powers are never abused by anyone of their own kind . And they 're watching him . Meaning he 's one of them . Or was . The key , I believe , is to be found in that crashed ship where you discovered Iblis . That 's just what I thought . You couldn 't examine the ship because of radion levels . - But with special equipment ... - All right , now . I want you to go back there . Alone . You mustn 't tell anyone of this . And you must forget this conversation . Iblis will pick out your thoughts easily . - I understand . - I hope so . This could be the most important mission of your life . If you run into the Count , he 'll know where I 've gone . I 'll crowd my mind with other thoughts . That too was part of the institute 's investigation into telepathy . How is it after all this time I 'm still learning things about my own father ? How is it after all this time I 'm still learning things about my own son ? Apollo ! - What are you doing here ? - I 'm coming with you . I 'd love you to but I can 't tell anybody about this mission . That 's one promise you already broke . I gotta go . It could be life or death for us all . Then I 've got a stake in it , I 'm coming along . It 's between me and Iblis . Oh . Personal war . Single-handed combat . With the lives of the fleet hanging on the outcome ? - I don 't think you understand . - More than you think . You 're the one that 's always telling me I let my ego get in the way . Count Iblis has Sheba swooning , so ... It has nothing to do with Sheba . Maybe and , er ... maybe not . But you 're not going out to do whatever it is you 're going out to do without me . In order for this mission to succeed , it must be a secret . Apollo , we got a guy on board this bird who reads minds . Now , er , what happens if I should bump into him ? Starbuck ... OK , buddy . Let 's go . I was hoping you 'd see things my way . An unscheduled shuttle is launching . - Apollo said to check with you . - Yes , I know . A passenger ship asked for some special instruction of triad for the children on board . Apollo thought it might be impressive if the real champions went out on the fringes of the fleet . - A nice idea . - Yes . Um , Colonel ... do you know where Count Iblis is ? He 's visiting the Agro Ship 9 . With Sheba , I believe . I see . If he should ask to see me , would you tell him I 'm on a sleep period ? - For how long ? - Until further notice . That shuttle , what are its docking instructions with the passenger ships ? Passenger ships ? I don 't understand . Shuttle Alpha just headed off across the quadrant . - Across the quadrant ? - Is something wrong ? No . What could be wrong ? I always feel such peace here . It 's the only place that even comes close to what we lost . And even if it is floating in space , it 's alive . You can feel it . - What is it ? - What are you up to , Adama ? What ? What 's the matter ? Where are you going ? Progress report on Shuttle Alpha ? It is just leaving scanner range . It 's heading toward the planet ... The one where my ship crashed . - Count Iblis ! Where did you come from ? - Who is in that shuttle ? I don 't know ... exactly . - Captain Apollo and who else ? - I don 't really know . - Where is Adama ? - Well , he 's ... Thank you . - Yes , Colonel ? - I 'm sorry , sir , but it 's Count Iblis . He 's on his way to see you - something to do with the shuttle . Thank you , Colonel . I 'll handle it . I left orders I was not to be disturbed . You have sent your son in search of my identity . You told us your identity . When a mortal breaks a bargain with me , there is a high price to be paid . I don 't believe in you , Count Iblis , as did those poor souls who were destroyed on your ship on the planet . They followed you and they paid the price . There is a price that you will pay ... a life more meaningful to you than your own . No ! That 's where the answer lies . Let 's go . - Nothing , sir . - Commander , no sign of Count Iblis . And nothing from the ships in the fleet . If he were on the Galactica or within the fleet , we 'd know . A single viper did launch without clearance . I 'm sorry , that was Sheba . Sheba ? - She went after them . - The launch bay confirmed it . They tried to stop her but ... Father , you 'll have to issue a statement . Word is spreading throughout the fleet . She 's right . The disappearance of Count Iblis ... I mean , we must find him . He must be here somewhere . No . No , we won 't find him . He 's not here . He 's down there with them . - Nothing ? - Radion level was a myth . How is that possible ? How is anything the Count does possible ? Let 's go take a look at her crew . Everything is pretty well vaporised . Whatever hit this thing must have had the power of a sun . Starbuck ! - What are you doing ? - Stay back ! - I won 't . What is it you found ? - Don 't go in there . - Let me go ! - You don 't want to go in there ! Apollo . Maybe she should . Maybe you 're right . Take a look . All right , I will . No ! I forbid it ! Sheba ! Come to me . Don 't listen . Turn around and look at what we found . Don 't be deceived . You 're mine . Come , be with me . - Sheba ! - Do not touch her ! She is mine . She has given herself to me freely . Listen to me . Come out of it ! Hear me ! Let her go . I command it . You command no one who does not willingly give you dominion . You have no power over me ! You know who I am . Yes , I finally know . Think back to the ancient records . The names Mephistopheles , Diaboles , the Prince of Darkness . I will give you one more chance before I strike her down . Death to her , Apollo . May her soul curse you through eternity . Apollo ! Apollo ! My God ! He 's dead . You ... You killed him ! Sheba , come . - No . - Sheba . You want to come . No . I could never follow you again . Apollo , what have I done ? You didn 't do it . He did it . What is it ? What 's wrong , Count ? Nothing 's wrong . Then why are you so worried ? Did you break some rule ? - It 's time for me to go . - Why , what happened ? Was it within your dominion to strike down a follower ... a soul given to you freely , but not an innocent ? A spirit whose life you took against his will ? No one has dominion over me . I wonder . There will come another time , another place ... and we will meet again . Starbuck , he 's gone . He just vanished . Everything 's the same as it was when he first appeared . No . One thing 's different . Apollo 's dead . Let 's take him home . I 'm so sorry . This was all my fault . Were you alone ? Seems to me everyone 's trying to find someone or something to believe in . But Apollo knew better . Why did he have to be the one to pay ? I 'd gladly trade my life to have him back . Starbuck ? I see ' em . Here we go again . As if we haven 't been through enough already . What do they mean ? What are they ? Whatever it means , whatever they are ... They 're gone , at least for now . Compute range back to the fleet . Starbuck ? I don 't know . They 're coming from behind . See if you can get a look at it ! I can 't stand the sound ! The controls are freezing up ! We 're losing speed ! What is this ? Who are you ? Do not attempt to communicate . You are safe . Sheba ! His restons are normal and responding to balcon infusion . Allow him to rise . Who are you ? Where 's Sheba ? The companion you refer to will join you as soon as she is able . Where are we ? Within a dimension quite apart from your own . Yeah , well , I can ... I can hear you and I can see you ... That is by our choice . Yeah , well , I 'm not so sure . - It passed right through you ! - Starbuck ! Sheba ! Are you all right ? I don 't know . I think ... maybe we 're dead . Is that right ? We 're dead and you 're ... angels ? Oddly enough , there is some truth to your speculation . It is time . If you will follow me ? What do we do ? There aren 't many places where I haven 't felt in complete control but this is an exception . Apollo ! Oh , Starbuck , I thought this was all some horrible , awful dream . But it 's true , we lived it all . What are you doing with him ? Can 't you leave him alone ? He 's of no possible harm to you ! Precisely the opposite . He is of great value to us . What ? He and any like him who have the courage to grow beyond the limitations of the flesh . - Starbuck , what are they saying ? - You 're asking me ? Starbuck , you have a most promising spirit . A trifle unrestrained but perhaps with Apollo 's continued fellowship ... Oh , please , I 've already lived through his death once , don 't keep reminding me of it . Apollo was not meant to die . Sheba , it was you that Count Iblis meant to destroy . What are you saying ? Apollo sacrificed his mortal body to save your spirit from falling . Will you sacrifice your own to bring him back ? Whatever you 're going to do to us , get it over with ! No , Starbuck , wait . Maybe these ... maybe these people aren 't so unlike us . - What are you , delirious ? - No , I mean it . They know who we are and what we are . Yes , and that gives them a pretty big advantage . But I think they 're on our side . I think ... All right , yes . If it 's possible , I will trade my life for Apollo 's . What about you , Starbuck ? Did you not say inside your ship that you would gladly trade places with Apollo ? How ... how could you know that ? Apollo ! Apollo ! You 're alive . It 's a miracle . I don 't know who you are but whatever you want from me , you can have . We want nothing from you . Then why are you doing all this ? Because we fight a common foe ... the forces of darkness and evil throughout the stars . But why are you bothering with us ? We come from a simple handful of human survivors . Because as you are now , we once were . As we are now , you may become . When ? After you 've seeded and nurtured new civilisations . After you 've evolved . - On Earth ? - Perhaps . - Will you show us the way ? - Perhaps we can give you a beginning . What about Count Iblis ? Is he one of you ? He now uses his powers to corrupt and lead others away from truth . Why can 't you stop him ? Because we cannot interfere with freedom of choice . His , yours , anyone 's . But you interfered to save my life . You were only dead by primitive measures and it was not Count Iblis ' right to take your life . He must now forfeit some payment of our choosing . In any case , it is time for you to return to your people . One last concern - there were other warriors who disappeared . They will return with reasonable explanations . Now it is time for you to be returned . Let us drink to the return of our children and to the end of Count Iblis . Whoever he was . Apollo . Dr Paye tells me that when he examined you , he found you had experienced some kind of physical duress . I am a little sore , Father . Why ? What happened ? That 's the strangest part of it , Father , I can 't tell you . It was like being caught up in a vortex , some kind of force field . My senses got scrambled . Where were you when we found the pilots ? You were nowhere to be found . How did we get back to the fleet before you ? Er , something ... happened . Something I can 't explain . I don 't remember anything after challenging Count Iblis . You challenged Count Iblis ? - And won ? - No , Adama . He challenged Count Iblis and lost . Lost ? That 's not possible . Apollo 's here . Iblis isn 't . Count Iblis ... tried to kill Sheba ... and Apollo got in his way . Is that all you remember ? No . I remember ... Sheba and I taking Apollo 's ... body and putting it on the shuttle and leaving the planet . - His body ? - Yes . And then you landed on the Galactica , Apollo was merely stunned and you frightened Iblis away . - Yeah , that must be it . - That has to be it . It was , uh ... There was one more thing . A light . A sound . - It was beautiful . - Yes , it was . It was as if ... there was something good and pure ... and caring out there . There are very few who 've had the opportunity to experience the light of good and truth at first hand . Then you mean that 's what happened to us ? We got caught in the war between good and evil ? We 've always been caught between good and evil . That would be no different even if we were to find Earth . Earth - quadrant Alpha , 19 million sectars by ... Epsilon vector 22 ... on a circular reckoning course of 000.9 ... In a star system with nine planets and one sun .

 'The year is 1987 'and NASA launches the last of America 's deep-space probes . 'In a freak mishap , Ranger 3 and its pilot , Captain William " Buck " Rogers , 'are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life-support systems 'and returns Buck Rogers to Earth 500 years later . ' Prison approach , this is prison shuttle ILM-4 hauling up a new one for you . A real lively one . 'ILM-4 , clear for Moon 3 approach . ' - Cease attack . - Affirmative , Colonel . Surrender for inspection . We know you 're transporting contraband . What ? This is a prison ship . Identify yourself . Colonel Deering , Earth Defense Directorate . I urge you to comply . This is a Zeta government star ship , operating within Zetan territory . 'You have no jurisdiction . ' As I said , extending docking bays . Lieutenant , see to the good captain . Wait a minute . You can 't do this . Now , Captain , we both know this won 't hurt a bit . - Hello there . Goodbye there . - How 's it going , Lieutenant ? Almost done . I wish I could be there to use this on the androids guarding that prison . I have a few secret weapons of my own . That medallion is your only means of escape . - If you get into trouble down there ... - You can 't get me out . I remember . - You ready ? - I 've adjusted his memory circuits . He 'll never know we were here . Good . You can take the real Val-Zahn back to Earth and I 'll say goodbye to the new one . - Be careful . - Don 't worry , Wilma . I go in , break Burton out , rendezvous with you in four hours , it 's a piece of cake . Here . Easy on the starch , right ? How long before we land ? Huh ? Land ? 15 minutes . It 's about time you woke up . I thought maybe you were dead . You might as well be . No one 's left this prison alive yet . - Then the substitution went well ? - ' Yes , Doctor . Perfectly . ' And Lieutenant Zimmerman had no trouble ? - Piece of cake , as Buck would say . - ' I beg your pardon ? ' Everything went as planned . At least so far . Dr Huer , I 'm not convinced ... Colonel , I assure you ... - Bidibidibidi . Someone 's at the door . - Ambassador Warwick is here . Continue your orbit and keep us posted . Buck will be fine . Huer out . Ted , by Jove . How nice to see you again . How long 's it been , anyway ? Do you really want an answer to that ? No , I certainly do not . Come in . This is my colleague Dr Theopolis from the computer council . Doctor , this is Ambassador Warwick , our diplomatic liaison in the third quadrant . - A pleasure to meet you , Ambassador . - Bidibidibidi . Bidi . - Of course , this is Twiki , his ambuquad . - Yes . Well , I 'm afraid I have bad news for all of you . I 've applied diplomatic pressure on the Zetan government , but they still refuse to release Jen Burton into your custody . It would appear , Elias , that extradition is not possible at this time . Well , this news is not exactly unexpected . Which is why we 've mounted a little extradition of our own . What do you mean ? An agent will break Burton out of the Zetan prison and bring her to Earth . You went behind my back ? That could provoke a disastrous interstellar incident . - Zeta 's a sovereign planet . - Yes , that 's quite true . And that 's a very good point , Ted . But , you see , we 're desperate . Pantera 's raids on our shipping lanes are crippling the outer colonies and someone is leaking our shipping schedules to him . Jen Burton , Pantera 's ex-girlfriend , will undoubtedly tell us who . - She 's a confessed murderer . - Come , now , Ted . It 's common knowledge Pantera committed the crime . She 's just covering for him . The Zetan government had her incarcerated as a matter of principle . Certainly not justice . The prison on Moon 3 is impregnable . - Your agent can never get her out . - On the contrary . Given Buck 's considerable talents , it has a 93 % probability of success . Buck is going to break her out from within , then rendezvous with another agent at Station Post 7 , which is outside the prison 's aerial defence shield . Captain Rogers and Colonel Deering are talented operatives . We have every reason to expect success . You put me into a very awkward position , Elias . What am I to tell the Zetan government ? We 'd like you to tell them nothing , just yet . Later on ... Yes . Well , if you 'll excuse me , I 'd like to do some thinking . For a man whose allegiance should lie with the Earth , he appears to be torn by the situation . Well , he 's a diplomat . It 's his job to see both sides . I 'm sure he feels I 'm using our friendship to sway his judgment . Which I suppose I am . Yes , sir , it 's too bad you had to learn the hard way . If you break the law on Zeta , you go to prison . You don 't go to be socially rehabilitated . No , sir , you go to be punished . On Zeta , they do it right . Here we are . Just so you know where you 'll be spending the rest of your life , the prison is 200 metres straight down . Carved from solid bedrock . Yes , sir . On Zeta , they do it right . " On Zeta , they do it right . " Make it into a bumper sticker and make a fortune . A bumper sticker ? Welcome to Moon 3 . Move between the stasis poles , please . He said move ! - Move , huh , Hugo ? - My name 's not Hugo . It ought to be . Looks like Val-Zahn here will be with us for a long time . Does this mean we 're engaged ? It means if you don 't behave yourself , I 'll know about it . Proceed with decontamination . ( Electronic humming ) This one 's a mess . Gonna take a while . ( Humming becomes more intense ) Pantera , is that you ? No , just me . I told him to be here . For the record , old man , you don 't tell me anything . Oh ? Then I suppose you already know that the Defense Directorate plans to break Jen Burton out of prison instead of extraditing her ? - We 'll have to kill her before she gets here . - No . That girl went to prison thinking I was going to get her out . When she finds out the truth , she 'll talk . But to kill her ? About how you supply me with the shipping schedules . About how I kick back one-fifth of my take to you . Are you going to let her destroy you like that ? Face it , old man , it 's your life or hers . Huer 's agent is going to break the girl out of prison then rendezvous with Colonel Deering at Station Post 7 . So Majel and I will take off for Moon 3 immediately and see that none of them leave there alive . I 'll stay close to Huer , advise you of developments . You do that , old man , cos if you 're setting me up , I 'll see that you fall with me . Hard . Bye-bye . That ought to do it . ( Humming stops ) Activate your scanner . Wait a minute . He 's wearing contraband . The X-ray shows a necklace . Hold on . It 's just a keepsake , a good-luck charm . Your luck ran out . You bribed somebody down there for nothing . I 'll keep it . We 're keeping it . You like our filing system ? Here we are . You 're just in time for some sunshine . I hope you took a good look at the real thing , cos from now on , this is all you get . ( Under his breath ) 54 , 53 , 52 , 51 , 50 , 49 ... Excuse me . Jen Burton ? I 'm Buck Rogers . I 'm here to break you out of this place . Your name 's Val-Zahn and I 've heard that line before . Many times . Except this time it 's not a line as you 'll find out in about 25 seconds . - When did the penal system go co-ed ? - What ? - Boys and girls together . - How else would you do it ? - Men in one place , women in another . - But the problems that would cause . I don 't feel like talking . Leave me alone . Do me one favour . Hit the deck . - What ? - Get down . Hey , look at this . Hope you 're wearing climbing shoes . The elevator 's out of order . Escape is not possible . Prisoners will report to the day room . Escape is not possible . Prisoners will report to the day room . Escape is not possible . Prisoners will report to the day room . Escape is not possible . ( Jen coughing ) Thanks . Listen , I 'm sorry about the way I acted in there . - I really had heard that line before . - Keep moving . I was thrown by your name . Never heard Mal say anything about Buck Rogers . By the way , where is Mal ? - He didn 't send me . - Then why rescue me ? Rescue 's a little premature . We 've got a rendezvous to make . - With who ? - Whom . With Wilma . Come on . My sensors picked up a seismic disturbance at the prison . 'Right on schedule . ' Can you verify Captain Rogers didn 't trap himself and Burton in the explosion ? Negative . The prison 's aerial defence shields are still operating . 'The communications are out . 'I can 't get close for anything but long-range scans . ' We 're assuming they made it . Descend to your rendezvous . 'The sooner we get that woman back to Earth ... ' The sooner we stop Pantera . I understand . Deering out . Ted , I know we 've made things difficult for you and I apologise . It 's the Zetans who have made things difficult . After all , their resistance to Jen Burton 's extradition was totally unfounded . In view of the situation , quite puzzling , actually . Not really . As an independent planet , Zeta 's distrustful of the Earth Federation 's activities . - I suppose that 's true . - Well , now , if you 'll excuse us . Ambassador Warwick and I have had little chance to chat . - Can I interest you in dinner ? - Only if you let me buy . That 's fair enough . You know , I remember ... Bidibi . Bidibidibidi . I agree , Twiki . There is something odd about the Ambassador 's attitude . I wonder if there is some kind of pattern , human or otherwise , in Pantera 's attack on our shipping . Take me down to central data , please . - Bidibidi . What about Buck ? - He has no way of communicating with us . If he 's in trouble , there 's nothing we can do . Bidibi . What a bummer . I said let go of me ! I 'm not taking one more step until you tell me what 's going on . It 's a long story and you won 't care for it . This is a big desert and I don 't like it much either . - Promise to keep walking ? - If you keep talking . All right . It 's a deal . Come on . - So where is it we 're heading ? - Station Post 7 . Dr Huer says it 's colourful , has sort of a Moroccan flavour . - A what flavour ? - Never mind . We rendezvous with Wilma in two and a half hours . - How did I get into this ? - By falling in love with a real fink . I don 't know what you mean , but I think I won 't like it . You 're catching on . ( Crackling ) ( Beeping ) Listen , you came a long way and took a big risk for nothing . I 'm not going to tell the Defense Directorate anything . Maybe you 'll feel differently when you get back to Earth . Maybe I won 't get back to Earth . Let me slip away . Tell your people I escaped . They 'd never know . You could do that , couldn 't you ? - Sorry . - Why not ? Are they giving you a fat bonus for bringing me in ? No . I 've just never been very good at lying . An Earth ship will soon dock at the space port . It 's piloted by a woman named Wilma Deering . Take her to the service area and keep her there out of sight . Understood ? 400 credits now . 600 later . We 'll meet you in the service area . We 're making good time . Want to stop for a rest ? I 'm fine . - If you 're tired , I don 't mind if we rest . - I said I 'm fine . Well , I 'm tired and I 'm going to take a rest . - Pull up a rock . - I 'm not going to let you take me back . What are you going to do , abandon me here in the wilderness ? Jen , why don 't you at least wait till we get to the next station post ? It 's that way . ( Beeping ) Welcome to Station Post 7 , Wilma Deering . Don 't make me use this , OK ? Unconscious people are difficult to carry and dead ones are so unappealing . - Are you crazy ? You 've got witnesses . - Witnesses ? Any of you witnesses ? Just not that kind of town . Come this way to the service building . Uh-uh ! Don 't try anything . I could use this , but you 'd probably feel very uncomfortable when you came to . - Uh , this way ? - Just start walking . - I 'll tell you when to stop . - OK . I bet I know why you were attracted to Pantera . Cos most of the people you knew weren 't . What ? I 'm my own person . Oh ? So you attach yourself to Pantera to prove you 're your own person . - He needed me . - He used you . - What would you know ? - He promised to spring you out . - How long you been in there ? - The time hadn 't come yet . What 's he waiting for ? Jen , you 've been in there for ten months . He won 't spring you out . He 'll leave you and the secrets of the murders in there forever . I don 't care about you , so stop pretending you care about me and who I am and just leave me alone . Sand squid ! You got it . Come on . - You all right ? - I don 't know how , but I 'm fine . ( Squeaking ) Buck ! Oh , hi . Do you want to talk about this ? Oh , God ! OK , big guy , come on . - You OK ? - Still breathing . How about you ? It 's not the sort of thing I want to do every day , but I 'll live . Thanks . - Returning the favour . Nothing more . - You never let your guard down . Sometimes . Thank you . Tell me , you got some sort of religious conviction against smiling ? That 's better . Well , this desert 's not getting any smaller . Shall we ? I got to admit , you 're not as bad as I thought . - Thank you . - You make a lousy first impression . Wait a minute . I got you out of there , didn 't I ? How long you been in there , ten months , rotting ? Well , not quite ten months . Nine and a half , maybe . The first five freighters Pantera intercepted were bound for the Rigel system . The next three for Vega . Two others for space station L-20 . Bidibidibidi . I smell a rat . I 'm not sure what you mean , Twiki , but it appears that almost all of Pantera 's raids occurred in the quadrant over which Ambassador Warwick has diplomatic jurisdiction . Bidibidi . Uh-oh . We must begin by tapping the Ambassador 's computer . Bidibidi . Someone isn 't going to like that . Meaning Dr Huer . Yes , I know , but what choice do we have , Twiki ? Bidibi . Life is tough . I don 't like this . Wilma was supposed to meet us here an hour ago . Well , she 's late . Let 's go to the space port and see if her ship is in . - They 're looking at our clothes . - I noticed . Um ... what about , uh ... ? - I never mugged anybody before . - Mugged ? It 's an old 20th-century custom . I 'll give you a demonstration . - Why are you doing this ? - Somebody paid me to . - Who ? - I don 't know . It never occurred to you to ask ? I 'm not getting paid 1,000 credits to ask questions . Never occur to you that 1,000 credits is nothing compared to what is at stake ? How come somebody wants you out of the way ? Now you ask the questions . You smuggling something ? You the one who 's been smuggling the quadrillium ? They 're probably tearing my ship apart right now . - Of course they 'll never find anything . - How much are you carrying ? 12 kilograms . But if you think I 'm going to tell you where it is ... You 're not going to tell me . You 're going to show me . Get moving . Now , then , let 's try it again . - Who 's your employer ? - I don 't know . I didn 't get any names . All right , then , where is your employer ? All right . Wilma 's obviously not in here . Maybe someone 's seen her . Come on . Excuse me , my dear . I see some friends . Excuse me . My name is Sergio Sanwiler . - Perhaps you 've heard of me . - No . Of course not . I can see you 're strangers . In fact , I couldn 't help but notice you 're prison escapees . I can get those off you and not report you . - For the right price . - We have no money . Wait a minute . Maybe we do . Not exactly in mint condition , but what are a few bacteria between friends ? Wrist , please . I 'm looking for a young lady . Came into town a few hours ago . Have you seen her ? - A blonde ? - Yeah . I might have , but information is an additional charge . Some find my perceptions valuable . I 'd be a fool to give them away for free . - Well ? - No . No blondes in today . Did see a redhead , though . Sorry . - There . Keep that as a little souvenir . - Wait . That 's it ? - That 's it . - That 's not information . If that 's the way you feel about my services , good day . Twerp . Now , let 's tour this ... city . She 's bound to be around here somewhere . ( Crackling ) ( Beeping ) ( Buzzer ) Please . You won 't be needing that . I 'm a gentle creature . - Who are you ? - Sergio Sanwiler . Perhaps you 've heard of me ? No . Well , no matter . I have some information if you 're in the market for it . I hear you 're looking for a pair of escaped prisoners , a man and a woman . - Where are they ? - First things first . 40 credits in advance . All right , you got your money , now get out of here . Gladly , sir . Wonderful doing business with you . Ta-ta . Well , this simplifies matters . I 've got another job for you . Sanwiler says they 'll be in the courtyard . Give that to Burton . She 'll know what to do with it . We 've been here five times . No sign of Wilma . - Maybe she 's hiding from someone . - Or locked up someplace . We can 't bust into every building in town looking for her . We can use the transmitter on board Wilma 's ship to contact Earth . They 'll send someone to pick you up and help me search for Wilma . Come on . I don 't care what you do to recharge the coolant units . I want that ship ready to take off in an hour . Now , move . No , old man , nothing to worry about . Just a call to allay your fears . Everything 's going according to plan . Deering 's out of commission and I set a trap for Rogers . Jen is as good as dead . Hey , Buck . - I 'm sorry . - For what ? Cos you cared enough to help . That 's why I 'm really sorry I have to do this . ( Whining ) Just hold still a moment , Buck . - Oh , boy . - Take it easy . - Give that shot a chance to work . - Wilma ? - Yeah , it 's me . - Where you been ? I got delayed by one of Pantera 's thugs . Where 's Jen Burton ? She 's gone . She hit me with some kind of a stun beam and split . I think she 's headed for Pantera by now . If she is , she 's as good as dead . He 's here to kill her , not rescue her . - He 's here ? - Yeah . - Where is he ? - At the boarding house . Whoa ! You all right ? Can you feel that shot working ? Give me a minute . ( Buzzer ) Mal , look who 's here . Hi . - I thought I 'd never see you again . - As well you should have . - My ring , Jen . - Mal ? - Is the ship ready for takeoff ? - Ten minutes . Let 's go . I don 't like sitting in one place . Come along . - Mal . - Stop it , Jen . Just my luck , the one person that ever broke out of that prison has to be you . I should have known . Maybe I did know . - I said come along . - Why ? So you can kill me ? You said you loved me . I said whatever was necessary to fulfil my needs . One of which you filled quite adequately . I said come along , Jen . You 're next , you know . Ah , there you are , Dr Theopolis . Any word from Colonel Deering or Captain Rogers ? None , I 'm afraid , Doctor . Colonel Deering 's status report is long overdue . Something 's gone wrong . But with Warwick peering over my shoulder , I can 't send in additional agents . Ambassador Warwick is a close friend of yours , is he not ? Yes , we were very close once . And now I 'm not sure I know him at all . He 's changed . When he was a young man , he was brash and full of himself . But also intelligent and compassionate . And supremely confident that one day he was going to be a great leader . It didn 't quite work out that way , did it ? A young man 's promise to himself is a difficult thing to live up to . I wish there were an easier way to tell you this , but my investigations indicate that Ambassador Warwick is working with Malary Pantera . I wish I were more surprised at that . Would you show me your data , please ? Bidibidi . After a while , you see , the burden of wealth begins to insulate you from reality . That 's why I told my valet , " Javin , just give me an old suit , a small shuttle " and let me discover the galaxy as only a peasant can . " Now what ? Pantera 's not at the hotel , not at the space port and not here . Yeah . Someone must have tipped him off that Jen and I were here . And I think I know who it was . Wait here . I 'll be right back . Lovely speaking to you , my dear . Javin is waiting for me out beyond the ... - Hello , Sergio . - Who ? You told Pantera where we were after I paid you to keep your mouth shut . - You owe me a favour . - Anything . - Where 's Pantera ? - Anything but that . This isn 't fair . You 're using your unnatural height to your advantage . - So sue me . Where 's Pantera ? - If he 's not at the hotel , I don 't know . Fine , then we 're going to search that desert until we find him . Well , in that case , his ship is being readied for departure in service building 3 . Fine . I knew you 'd respond to reason . Come on . Hyperthyroid . Now , then , as I was saying ... ( Crackling ) ( Beeping ) As you feared , Ambassador Warwick is not in his quarters . He is obviously aware of my suspicions and is attempting his escape . No . If he 'd left , we would have heard . He must be somewhere in the grounds . - Seal off the area immediately . - Already sealed . When they find him , shall I have security deliver him to your office ? No . Despite all that 's happened , he 's still a Federation officer and a friend . When security locates him , have them notify me . They 're not to take any action or make their presence known until after I arrive . You incompetent , how could you let her get away ? I 'm sorry . It wasn 't my fault . She used some kind of martial art technique I never saw before . - How did she get free ? - She said she ... Never mind . Get out of here and don 't think you 're going to get paid for your work . You 're lucky to be alive . And as for you , just a shove into an empty airlock and nobody will ever find the body in deep space . Sometimes a frontal assault works best . All right , move . Get over there . - Are you all right ? - I 'm fine . - Rescuing you 's a full-time occupation . - March out of here single file . Not quite , Colonel . Drop your weapons now . Frontal assaults do have drawbacks . ( Screaming ) ( Buzzing ) This does necessitate a little change in plans , doesn 't it ? Instead of one , there 'll be three bodies dumped in space . Go see what all that shouting 's about . ( Screaming ) Why 's he after me , Wilma ? What is it ? - It 's your bracelet . - Oh , it is , huh ? No ! Be my guest . You know he 's going to kill him . Please help me . Oh , boy . Come on . Help him . You just can 't let him take Mal away . What am I supposed to do ? He 's a machine . All right . I know where I can cut him off . Come on . You 've got to stop him . - He 's a machine , not a human being . - Just stop him . Hugo , it 's all over . You 're not taking him in . All right , full power . Controls set . Fire ! - Idiot , you let her take your gun ! - You were hurt . Will you get away from me ? I told you you were next . You don 't want to do that , Ted . - What 's the trick ? Where are your guards ? - No guards . Just me . I wanted to give you the opportunity to surrender . How considerate of you . I just heard from my people on Zeta . Pantera 's been captured . Jen Burton is still alive . Tell me something , would you really have allowed him to kill her ? I ... tried not to think about it too much . - I see . - No , you don 't see . You can 't see . You can 't know what it 's like to be a go-between . A messenger . I was the one who was going to send the messages , remember ? Not be the one to deliver them . I was going to build something . Something important . Something that would last . You took Pantera 's arrest in stride . Congratulations . I adapt quickly . Besides , I had excellent help . Wait a minute , now . What is this ? Nothing . I just wanted a little something to remember all this by . Sure . - You don 't think that android could ... - No . You can keep it . ( Beeping )

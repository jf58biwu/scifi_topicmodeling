 What is it ? Trying to get a reading , Commander . - What about its range ? - Constant . Seems to me like it 's closing . It isn 't , Commander . Its range is constant . I checked this calculation against the computer ... Oh ! Les ? Maya , what about its composition ? Hydrogen ... - Nitrogen , mainly . - Mainly ? ! Certain elements unidentifiable . - ' Medical . ' - I need help . 'Les Johnstone has just passed out . ' Gerry , as soon as you can , a stretcher team to corridor B. Give me a hand . Someone give me a hand ! Come on . Easy ... All right , now , just take it easy . Let 's see . Anything more substantial on the sensor ? All gaseous ? Nothing solid ? That cloud 's affecting everything . My readings are not clear . John ? I 'm all right , Tony . I 'm all right . - Scanners are malfunctioning . - ( Beeping ) ( Maya ) And sensors erratic . 'John , people are passing out all over the base . ' We think we know the source ... - Give me a hand , someone . - ' John ? ' It 's a cloud , Helena . It 's a cloud . Take it easy , John . ( Helena ) ' Moonbase Alpha status report . '1,503 days after leaving Earth orbit . Dr Helena Russell recording . 'Seven days ago , a cloud containing unknown elements 'appeared in our east quadrant . ' Suddenly , lassitude , depression and loss of will has incapacitated most of our personnel . 'It has defied analysis by the medical equipment at my disposal . 'Some of the personnel appear to have immunity . 'This skeleton crew is keeping Moonbase barely operational . 'Astronaut Tom Graham , who appeared immune , 'was sent out four days ago in Eagle 6 to enter the cloud 'to collect particles for analysis so I could make a diagnosis 'and , thus , devise an antidote . 'Eagle 6 has failed to return from its mission . ' - Tony ! - ( Computer beeping ) Put it on the screen . ( Sandra ) Eagle 6 ! ( Tony ) That 's impossible . - It would have exhausted its fuel . - But that is Eagle 6 . Eagle 6 , this is Moonbase Alpha . We 're glad to see you ! Welcome back . Eagle 6 , this is Moonbase Alpha . Do you read me ? Come on , Graham , wake up ! Answer me . Eagle 6 , this is Moonbase Alpha . Come in , Eagle 6 . Tony , sensors pick up no life forms on Eagle 6 . What ? ! There is no life on board Eagle 6 . - Yes , Tony ? - ' Helena , let me talk to John . ' He 's in no condition to talk . 'Helena , Eagle 6 is right over our heads . ' - That 's great ! - ' Negative . 'It exhausted its fuel two days ago and sensors pick up no life forms . ' I 'll try . John ? John ? - It 's no use . - ' I 've got to talk to him . ' If you talked to him he wouldn 't be listening . Tony ? Eagle 6 is landing . 'Security . ' - How many men still on their feet ? - ' Three . ' I want one at the travel tube , two at Command Center . Fraser , let 's go . Graham ! - ( Door opens ) - Graham ? - What is it ? - I don 't know . Whatever it is , it brought our Eagle back . Who ... are you ? Where 's Graham ? No further or we 'll stop you . Fire ! Run ! Maya , tell Security I want them at the travel tube armed with rocket guns , on the double . - ' Tony , are you all right ? ' - Yeah , for the moment . - What did you find ? - The cloud , there 's new activity . What 's its range ? - ( Computer beeps ) - Still 22,000 . ( Maya ) I 'm getting readings . Do you think what the Commander says is true ? - That cloud is causing all this ? - Well , it 's a strong possibility . Something 's emitting high-frequency impulses . There 's a mass of some kind . You mean there 's a planet or an asteroid hidden in there ? Well , sensors can 't define specifically , but ... there 's something in there beyond just gas vapour . Anything comes out of that tunnel , fire the rockets without hesitation . Give me a fix on its position . ( Echoing voice ) ' Relative positions are of little consequence . ' Who are you ? 'Who we are is too complicated for your comprehension . ' - Try me . - ' Time does not permit . ' We 've got time - a lot of it . 'You are in error . You have very little time . ' - What do you want ? - ' Your life support system . ' - You mean we just give it to you ? - ' We have sent for it . ' We can 't exist without it . 'Neither can we . So we must deprive you of yours . ' Tony ! Travel tube . 'I will return your screens for you to observe . ' Fire ! - Get down to Medical Center . - Tony ... - Tony ! - Don 't argue ! I want to stay ! If you want to help me , get the hell out of here ! Move ! ( Groans ) ( Man yells ) - We must help . - Hold it . - We 've got to do something ! - We 're going to do something . ( Helena ) ' Medical . ' Let me know when Maya and San get to you . 'Right . - ' Tony ? ' - Yeah ? - ' Maya and San are here . ' - OK . Computer , priority one . As of now , all doors are non-operational . Repeat , all doors to be opened only at my voice command . 'Your efforts are futile . 'Give up your life support system and die peacefully . ' We don 't die on request . - ' We do not mean to be violent . ' - Oh , sure ( ! ) 'Unless our needs are denied . ' Open as ordered . Close ! 'You are in Command Center . 'The life support system is not in that location . ' - Split up here . - What about Life Support ? If it reaches it we 're finished . I 'll decoy it . You get to Life Support , set up a defence . Right . No , John , it 's not a good idea . You haven 't the strength . I do . Tony ordered me away . I must help him . If you want to help let him do it his way . If we don 't help , we 'll die ! I 'm all right . Maya , your comlock . ( Beeps ) Tony must have programmed the computer to lock all doors . Then no one can help him . If that thing is what you say , he did what he had to . Alan ... ! - Yeah , John ? - I can 't hold up . You take over . All right , come on , John . Here we go . Take it easy . You 're gonna be OK . All right , now , you ought to get back into bed as well , Alan . - ( Beeping ) - Now , wait a minute ... I feel better . Weak , but better . Your fever 's gone . Look , you got it first . Maybe it 's run its course . Are you all right ? Yeah . I 'd better be . Now , go ahead , get into bed . ( Beeps ) Yes , Alan ? - ' What 's the situation ? ' - Desperate . - ' How can we help ? ' - Just keep everybody out of the way . - Where are you ? - ' Tech-lab 5 . 'I 'm trying to get it in the vacuum chamber . ' - Uh-oh . Trouble . - ' Don 't take any chances . ' If this works , maybe I won 't have to take any . What 's happening ? Tony ! Tony , answer me ! Maya , he shouldn 't have to worry about you now . But he 's out there on his own . If he can decoy that thing into the vacuum chamber ... Nothing can live in a vacuum . - And if the creature won 't go in ? - Then you will have to help . ( Footsteps ) You can use this , the dosages are computer-coded . - ( Comlock beeps ) - Yes , Tony ? - Helena , let me talk to John . - He 's under sedation . - I 'm sorry , Tony . - Nothing to be sorry about . Let me talk to Alan . Helena ? Helena , are you all right ? - Tony , she 's fainted . - Help me . I 'll be all right . I 'll be all right . Come back here . ( Helena ) I think I 'll be all right . She has the sickness , Alan . Take care of her . Tony , you wanna talk ? It 's in the vacuum chamber . Everything 's under control . Alan ! ( Alan ) You 've got to help him , Maya . ( Sandra ) But we can 't release the doors . ( Alan ) Maya doesn 't need the doors . Maya , get out of here ! ( Groaning ) Run , Maya ! Come on . Open . Close . - Hey , you better get off your feet . - I 'm all right . Maybe I 'll think better sitting down . How 's John ? Still under sedation . You said everything was under control . Well , I was a little premature . The creature 's still on the loose ? Lasers or lack of oxygen don 't affect it . A massive dose of anaesthetic might do it . Even we had something , how could we apply it ? High-pressure injector gun . Load it with ... ionethermyocin . It 's the most powerful stuff we have , it 's ... it 's too powerful for a human being . Yeah , well , human this thing ain 't . Right , it 's simple to use . Just place it against the body and push the button . OK . You 're gonna have to take over in here . - I just can 't make it . - What do I do ? Tyomoxin tablets - give them to everybody that can swallow them . Are you all right ? This might not work on that creature . Something 's gotta work . How are we going to get close enough to use it ? I don 't know . We 've just got to . She 's sleeping now . Let 's see if we can find it . ( Maya ) It 's heading for Life Support . Yeah , let 's go . Tony , I 'm going with you . That 's all I need , you passing out on me . Tony ! It 'll be OK . Open . Close . It 'll get to Life Support before we will . Maybe . In here . Open . Close . There it is . ( Alarm beeping ) What 's that ? ! It 's confused . Let 's see how confused we can get it . Creature ! You , creature ! 'Creature ! Here I am ! ' - ( Alarm continues ) - ' I 'm over here ! ' He 's falling for it . The Hydroponic Experimental Section , lead it there . - We can fill it with chlorine . - OK . Open . Close . Creature ! Here I am ! 'I 'm over here ! ' 'Here I am ! I 'm over here ! ' ( Comlock beeps ) Tony , I 'm at Hydroponic . Can you open the door ? ( Beeps ) Computer , open door to Hydroponic Section . - ' Alan . ' - The red alert ? 'It 's a ploy to confuse the creature . ' We 're gonna hit it with chlorine . - ' Can anybody else help ? ' - Only Fraser . He 's in Life Support . If the chlorine doesn 't work , we 've had it . No , no , maybe not . I haven 't got time to explain . Get over to the Hydroponic unit . Right . Open . Close . Open ! Close . - ' Life Support . ' - Fraser ... Set up an electrical barrier across the approach to Life Support . - ' I wouldn 't know how to do it . ' - No , me neither . San 's the expert . She 'll tell you all about it . Bill , listen carefully . Go to the main electrical unit in corridor 34 . All right , San . 'Take the limpets used for emergency cable runs . ' Got them . Fix them both sides of the corridor . Make a cable barrier . Right . - ' All right , San . ' - Good , Bill There are cable rolls on the shelf . 'You need type HT 15 . 'I will give you details when you get there . ' Right . Close ! - You ready ? - Yeah . - How do we get it in ? - The chlorine-breather on Kreno . Right . Creature ! I 'm over here ! Open ! Close ! ( Comlock beeps ) - ' Tony ? ' - Yes , Alan ? - How 's it going ? - ' The chlorine is having no effect . ' Can she hit it with the anaesthetic ? No . I need to get in to help her . 'No . Get in amongst that chlorine , you 'll die . That won 't help Alpha . ' I-I 'm OK . I think I 'm gonna be OK now . - You have to stay off your feet . - I 've got to go and help them . Tony and Maya can handle it if anybody can . Now , come on . Open . Open ! Maya ! Stay down ! What do you think ? If we could get enough voltage through it , it could work . Get the mobile HT generator and take it to the barrier . 'I will take you through it step by step . ' I 'll call you when it 's in position . Right . Alan , it didn 't work . Where is it now ? 'Hunting for our life support system . 'It won 't take him long to find it . ' Tony , go to Life Support , but be very careful . Fraser is setting up an electrical barrier . 'OK . ' Maya , there is one way we can get on an equal footing with that creature . - You become one . - I 've tried to . But you can change into any life form . Not this one . Its molecular structure eludes me . 'Why do you resist the inevitable ? We don 't want to inflict pain . ' I know . You 're gonna kill us with kindness ( ? ) 'Sarcasm in your circumstances is no defence ! - ' Accept your fate . ' - Come on , Maya . - You did say terminal 42 ? - ' Terminal 42 - four-two . ' All right , San . 'Now take the remote switch gear through the barrier . 'It should be all right , but don 't touch the barrier , just in case . ' Thanks ( ! ) It is safe . Back ! - Let 's go . - Tony ... We 've tried everything . Nothing works . We have to keep trying . - We can 't stop it ! - We can 't give up ! Nothing we 've done has had an effect . I know that , but ... Wait , there is something we haven 't tried - the cloud . Yes , the cloud ! That 's what controls it . If we can threaten it , it 'll have to call the creature back . - How ? - Come on . - Give me range and elevation . - Range , 43,000 . Elevation , 27-3 . On target . Right , here goes . - It 's thinned out a bit , Tony . - Yeah . Tony ... - That must be its control centre . - Yeah . Target . Range , 43,200 . Elevation , 27-7 . - It worked ! - We 've done it ! 'Futility , Mr Verdeschi . An exercise in futility . ' ( Tony ) The one on the left . Range , 44,000 . Elevation , 28-2 . The one on the right . Range , 44-7 ... elevation , 28-3 . ( Manic laughter ) Let 's get out . Hold it ! It is safe . I tested it . Am I glad to see you ! Everything set ? Maya better check it . I don 't know about electrics . Do you think that 'll stop it ? Nothing else has . That 's what it 's after . Yeah , and if it gets it ... Tony . OK , Maya . Circuit activated . Right , come over here . Next time , it 's gonna make it . I know . Maya ... This isn 't exactly the time I 'd pick to say this ... - Say what ? - Psychon 's my favourite planet . We don 't have time to play with words , Tony . Maya , I love you . ( Fraser ) Tony . Fire ! How can any life form take that ? Tony , it 's no life form . Oh , yeah ? When Eagle 6 came down my sensors showed no life form . It lived in a vacuum . Chlorine , lasers , electricity - nothing affects it . Open ! Fraser ! ( Fraser yelling ) Tony , it 's a robot ! It doesn 't matter what it is if it gets that core . - We can beat it . - How ? - Get to its control centre . - We don 't know where it is . ( Fly buzzing ) ( Buzzing continues ) Maya ... ( Alarm beeping ) ( Fly buzzing ) - He 's taken the core ! - Yes . ( Groans ) ( Fly buzzing ) M-Maya . ( Maya ) It won 't get up again . Oh , you 're awake . I always sleep with my eyes open when I 'm in traction ( ! ) - Tony ! - What 's that ? 3D solitaire . Solitaire ? ! How come I 'm alone here ? This place was jumping with patients . - They 're well now . - And John ? He 's assessing the damage the creature did . - Helena ? - Checking out life support systems . What about Bill Fraser ? Why isn 't he here with me ? He only suffered bruises and contusions , - and he heals quicker than you . - Very funny ( ! ) Talking about friends , that cloud , is it still on the screen ? It 's disappeared . It 's really eerie . Something almost kills us and then just disappears . Mmm . Look , this is how it 's done . The cards are played from one level to the next . Like that . Uh , Maya ? You know all that wild garbage I handed you ? Wild garbage ? Yeah , the heavy syrup , the thousand violins , all that romantic stuff . That 's wild garbage ? ! A guy says a lot of strange things when he 's under pressure . Right ? Hmm ! Right . Well , how about that ? She 's really crazy about me .

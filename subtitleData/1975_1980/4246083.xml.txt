 # Us Alphans travel in haste # Deep in the caverns of Alpha Moonbase # Through such a tunnel what mysteries unfold # Could be we 'll find us a pot of bright gold # Yeah # I 'll settle for the dylenide crystals we 're looking for . This is a good place . Set her up . ( Machine hums ) Hey , that 's no dylenide crystal ! Try the cutter . Broaden the beam . What the ... Cut the beam ! - It 's a couple of corpses . - It 's impossible ! Hey , I thought I just saw ... Aaarghh ! Mr Carter ! Mr Carter ! OK , set it up over there . Welcome back among the living . You had us worried for a moment . Come on . Could this be some form of cryogenic suspended animation ? Cabinet temperature 's four degrees centigrade . Cool , but well above the cryogenic temperature range . Life signs ? Nothing . No sign of life at all . No brain activity , no heartbeat . ( Alan ) I saw his eyes open , I tell you . - I saw his eyes open ! - ( Tony ) Impossible , Alan . Just suppose the moon was inhabited in the past , could this be some sort of burial ground ? It 's an elaborate cemetery . That 's a very strong force field . - Who are they being protected from ? - Wait a minute . See that ? On Krome II , the inhabitants knew that as a sign of danger . They called it Flammon , the death glow . Right . It was a sign left by a god-like race to warn the people of the places where their lives might be in danger . - Yeah . - Helena . Just a moment ago , I had a heartbeat . Has there been any change in the volume of air in the lungs ? An increase of 2.5 millilitres in just over seven minutes . What does that mean ? He 's breathing . ( Cracking ) Tony ! That section of wall . That must be the power source . ( Alan ) And control panel . That must control the force field . - Can you operate it ? - If I knew where to start . If only Maya was here , she could . She isn 't and we can 't wait two days for she and John to return from the Blue Quadrant . Watch out ! The roof ! It 's coming down ! - Get out of here ! - Everybody ! - ( Helena ) We can 't leave them ! - Get out ! Go ! Get out of here ! Tony ! Tony ! Get out ! Over here . Swing him round . That 's it . - Alan ! - No , Tony ! He 's a kid ! He 's just a kid ! Come on . Set him down over here . Brain pulse and heartbeat levelling off , at norm minus 0.2 . Get the monitor on the boy . Etrec ... Etrec ... - Take it easy . You 'll be fine . - Etrec ... Etrec ... - I got a heartbeat . - Pure oxygen . Brain pulse . Another heartbeat . Levels ? Brain pulse - 773 and rising . Heart 44 ... 45 ... 46 ... increasing steadily . - Is he safe ? - As safe as we are . Moonbase Alpha status report , Dr Helena Russell recording , 640 days after leaving Earth orbit . Special incident report , excavation discovery . Supplementary - medical . Both subjects are resting quietly . Cardiac stimuli no longer necessary . Monitoring of all physical functions is being maintained . Preliminary analysis indicates cell structure and metabolism 91.7 % of human norm . Further investigations will be carried out . Commander Koenig has been contacted and informed of the situation . How are they ? - In deep sleep . - Natural or sedated ? Sedated . They 're still on Somnol . All readings stable . Good . Let 's cut the Somnol . I 'd like to program the computer for a more detailed analysis . Right . Somnol will hold them for a few more hours . Let me know when you have things set up . Pasc ! Quiet . My son . Have they come back ? - Have they found a way ? - We are among strangers . - There is no way but our way . - No , Pasc . No ! Perhaps the strangers can help . There is no help for me . Soon there will be no help for you . No ... not yet . Please ! Don 't let it come . I cannot stop it . - Yes , you can ! - How ? Kill me . - I cannot ! - Why not ? You killed Lok and Kerak . I need you . The time is coming ... when you will need me . Did the Commander get the report ? - Yes , on the last transmission . - There 's another due . ( Tony ) It 's starting to come through now . Eagle 1 , come in , Eagle 1 . 'Eagle 1 to Moonbase Alpha , are you receiving ? ' Not too well , Commander . Visual not holding steady . 'We 're approaching a meteor storm so let 's wrap this up fast . ' OK , I 'll prepare Eagle 3 in case you need bringing in . 'Let 's hope we won 't need bringing in . 'Anything to add to the report on the two aliens ? ' I haven 't completed a full medical analysis yet . Tests show them to be borderline human norm . 'Tony ? ' Origin unknown , no ID , unable to interrogate yet . Until then , they 're an X factor . 'Until you do , treat them as an X factor . ' Check . And what would you like to know ? Hey , cobber ! You 're up and doing ! Cobber ? Yeah . That means you 're a pal , you know - a real close buddy . Our systems break down a sedative more quickly than yours . - Your head ? - A scratch . My equilibrium was not fully restored when I stood up . My head hit the wall . Please , please ! I cannot allow you ! A man 's blood holds deep spiritual significance on Archanon . 'Archanon ? 'Archanon . 'It 's the planet of peace . ' Yes . We are Archanons - the peace bringers . I am Pasc . This is Etrec , my son . And you , I know , are Commander Koenig . 'There are legends of the their coming - conquest of evil by good . ' ( Static ) We 've lost them . Keep the channel open . They 'll get back to us . The conquest of evil by good . Violence was outlawed in our Archanon world . We had replaced evil with good amongst our own people . We sent our emissaries throughout the universe so others might see it could be done . I was the commander of such a mission . From what we 've seen , you 've not had much success . It takes time . It takes time to reach all beings . It was not , however , until we reached YOUR solar system that we met with total failure . My mission ended on your third planet . Earth . We established a base on your moon ... and observed . We saw such violence and hatred ... that my wife , Lyra , begged me to leave Earth to its fate . I overruled her . We descended . Like doctors entering a plague area , we thought we were immune . We were not . Only Etrec and I escaped contagion . When we returned to our moonbase , the whole crew mutinied . We were overpowered and placed in stasis while they left to carry on their madness , your madness , to the farthest corners of the universe . Why the stasis chamber ? Why didn 't they kill you ? They could not . - The Archanons cannot die ? - Archanons cannot kill . Not even in their madness . The taking of any form of life is abhorrent . Indeed , impossible to them . So how can they condemn a man and a boy to a living death in a stasis chamber ? Your wife - what happened to her ? She led the mutineers . She put us here . Etrec ! Is he all right ? All right , now . It could be the sun . Let 's get him to medical . Come on . - Got him ? - Yep . All right , let 's go . What kind of people can do that to one of their own race ? What kind of mother can do that to her son ? - How is he ? - There 's nothing organically wrong . There are things I don 't understand . I 'll have to do some tests . Hey . Hiya , cobber . How are you feeling ? Hungry . The only thing wrong is he hasn 't had a square meal in 1,000 years . Listen , there 's a little place down the corridor - hamburgers like you wouldn 't believe . Ham ... burgers ? They 're mixed up with hydroponic soya , but they taste like the real thing . Is that OK , doc ? It 's OK , but take it easy . Like you said , he hasn 't had a square meal in 1,000 years . Come on . Let 's go . - Ooh ! - Can you make it ? - I ... I think so . - Come on . No , I think I 'd better carry you . No ! Please , I would like to walk . - Carry me ! - OK . Hop up on the old kangaroo . We 're off for a bite to eat , you wanna join us ? Come on , cobber ! Here we go ! Hey-hey ! It 's a virus , all right . No question about it . Look at those tendrils . They must indicate that the virus is still alive in Pasc 's sputum . Right . Let 's see Etrec 's plate . It has all the same characteristics except for the tendrils . Dead ? It could be dormant . We 'll have to check it out . All right , Etrec ! Take this pass clean ! Hey ! Oh , that 's good ! That really is good . Now we 'll try this drop kick again . Ready ? You wait here . Mr Carter ... Now , remember , son ... Bluey , out of the way ! Etrec , two eyes , into two hands . Ready ? Here we go . Long and low . Hey ! Great ! OK , this is the big one . This is the try line . Are you ready ? You get past me , I 'll tackle you . Swerving all the time . OK . Put it in . Run , go ! I 'm going to tackle you ... Ooh ! What happened ? My granddad would be real proud of you . Excuse me , sir ... Hey , Bluey . You 're just in time . Australia beat Great Britain 50-12 , in ' 63 . - You 're kidding ! - That 's Harrison 's own signature . Where 'd you get it ? His grandfather used to play in Harrison 's team . He gave it to him because they were ... mates ? That 's right . Now , I 've got to get the champ ready for the big match . Mr Verdeschi asked me to find you . We 've got the stuff from the cavern . - Really ? - The chamber 's nearly all scrap . The power unit 's hardly touched . They 're down in Techlab 3 . Right . Let 's go . - Come on , Etrec . Over to you . - Back to you ! ( Whining ) - Did you score anything ? - I don 't even know how to open it . Etrec , your father 's on his way . So , move over and let an expert take a look . - You ? - Him ! Oh , I 'm sorry , I never handled power units . I only got as far as wave-particle analysis . If we have any wave-particle problems , we 'll send for you . Pasc would know . He was the Commander . It 's the same all over the universe . In the eyes of the son , the father is the infinite source of knowledge . In this case , as in all others , the confidence is somewhat misplaced . - But you knew all about ... - As Commander of the expedition , I was merely the co-ordinator . I had my ... my specialists for this type of thing . Yeah , well , how about opening it ... Commander ? I figure you can at least show us how to do that . ( Electronic beeps ) I know what that is . It 's a monitor transmitter . It 's used in ... planetfall to locate the ... the unit and ... the team using it . We 've got those . They don 't look like this . What 's its range ? Range ? Whatever range is required . Oh , I see . ( Beeping ) Yes , Helena ? 'Tony , are Pasc and Etrec with you ? ' - Yes . - ' Have them come to Medical Centre . ' - Could it hold just a bit ? - ' No , it 's important . ' If the doctor says it 's important , we better go . OK , but how about this first ? I 'll come back later and tell you what I can . Etrec . It 's not this way ! We 're not going there . We must get away ! Pasc ... That transmitter was set to the Archanon frequency . They now know we are free . - They will come for us ? - But they won 't find us . Where can we go ? You 've got the whole Eagle to yourself , including the storm shield . Keep it on the launch pad till the Commander asks for help . We will take the Eagle . But ... that is to save the Commander , if he needs help . WE need help . It 's going to save us . We have no choice . Somewhere we 'll find a place and make it our own . There is always someone left to kill . Here it is again . Pasc 's brainwave patterns peak here and here . There 's no corresponding movement in Etrec 's . You think it 's connected with the virus ? Active in Pasc , dormant in the boy ? There 's nothing we can do without blood samples to make a serum . - ' Yes , Helena ? ' - Are Etrec and Pasc still with you ? 'No . They left when you asked . Aren 't they there yet ? ' No . - ' I 'll get someone onto it . ' - Please . 'Eagle 1 to Moonbase Alpha . Come in , Moonbase Alpha . ' - How are you doing ? - That 's the best I can do . - ( Tony ) Eagle 1 , are you receiving ? - ' Hardly . ' What is your position ? 'Orbital reference 367 and highly uncomfortable . ' Shall we launch Eagle 3 ? It can reach you in 18 hours . 'You 'd better . We 've got meteorite damage to the hull . ' How about damage to you and Maya ? 'A few bruises and a little space-sick , but we 're ... ' ( Beeping ) Yes , Alan ? 'We think we 've found some kind of recording device on the power unit . 'If you 're still hooked into Eagle 1 , we 'd like an opinion from Maya . ' We 've lost contact . We 'll put you through if we regain . 'Thanks . ' Pasc ! We 've been looking all over for you two . Dr Russell wants you . - We ... we 're on our way there . - Other way around . Oh , I 'm sorry . We 're strangers here . What makes you think it 's a recording device ? It could be anything from a pencil to a paperweight . It 's just that this small panel could be a screen . So could a lot of things . No , I draw a blank on this one . You lack the old finesse , Bluey ! ( Buzzing ) '402 / 8 / 27 . 'Entering small solar system in sector GL / 33 / K. 'Third planet has indications of primitive life form . ' Hey , you 've done it , Mr Carter ! It 's a data bank ! Wait a minute ! Pasc , I think we 've got it ! You 'd better see this ! - Dr Russell wants them . - We 'll get them there . Thanks . I 'll get back , then . - What should I see ? - Right , well , let 's have a replay . Emergency in Techlab 3 . Security . ( Etrec ) Pasc ! No , Pasc ! Pasc ! Don 't ! ( Etrec ) Don 't ! Don 't ! You 've killed him ! You 've killed him . You didn 't have to kill him ! He was my friend ! We have no friends . Come on . - Alan , you OK ? - Yeah . Pasc . Find Pasc . - Medical Centre . - ' Yes ? ' Emergency , Techlab 3 . Get here fast . - Nature of the accident ? - ' No accident . 'Pasc assaulted Alan and Johnson . Severe head injury . 'Attention Security , find Pasc . He 's dangerous , may be armed . ' Come on . Pearce , you come with us . Long , stay with Johnson . - Stop ! - Cobber ! Etrec ! Come here by me . You let the boy go or I will kill the woman . Let the woman go or I 'll kill the boy . Go ahead . Shoot the boy . You can 't do it . The killing isn 't in you . But I can . I thought Archanons couldn 't kill . ( Etrec ) That mark is the sign of the killing sickness . ( Helena ) So that 's why you wore the bandage - to cover it up ! Now , listen carefully . We 're going to take Eagle 3 . Get all your men out of that section . Attention security . Clear all access corridors to Eagle 3 . Etrec . Etrec ! Come here to me ! You can lead the way . No , Pasc . I will not go . - If you stay , they will kill you . - The killing is not in them . Not now , perhaps . But soon it will be in you . Then they will have no choice . They will do ... what they have to do . I will stay . Etrec ! Come here ! Come with me or I will kill you myself ! Oh , Etrec , Etrec . Go ahead and cry , son . You can be alone in here . ( PA ) ' All security guards , Alert station signal three . 'Dr Russell has been taken hostage by Pasc . Use caution . 'Dr Russell 's wellbeing takes priority . 'I want Eagle 1 in the air above the pad . 'Nothing else is to move off the base . Repeat , nothing but Eagle 1 . ' I want all men in protective suits . There 'll be a team of sharpshooters with stun guns . Where 's Etrec ? - He 's in the recreation centre . - Good . ( Computer ) ' Abort mission . Launch pad deactivated . 'This order non-voidable until code reactivates . ' Talk to the Control Centre . No . Tell them to unlock the controls ... or I will kill you . You didn 't kill Etrec . You won 't kill me . - I should have killed him . - Why didn 't you ? He chose to stay . I choose survival . There may not be survival for either of you . There 's a virus in your systems . In Etrec , it seems to be dormant at the moment . In you , Pasc , it 's alive and it may be deadly . That 's why I wanted to take blood samples , to try to help . I don 't need your help ! We 've got to board that ship without alerting Pasc . The cargo hatch ? - Too much noise for drilling . - We could use an acid . The most powerful acid we have would take three hours to eat through . Through the propulsion tubes ? The inspection plates are thinner . Yeah . 'Verdeschi ... 'I want Etrec in exchange for your doctor . 'And I want your computer to release this Eagle . ' - Etrec has made his choice ! - ' Bring the boy to me . - ' Or I will kill the woman . ' - Helena , are you all right ? 'Get Raul , tell him to ... ' 'Medical Centre . ' Pasc called from Eagle 3 . He wants to swap Helena for the boy . - ' Do you trust him ? ' - Like standing in front of a laser ! But Helena tried to say something , " Get Raul , tell him to ... " and then Pasc cut her off . What do you think she meant ? 'We discovered a virus . Been trying to get blood samples to test . 'Maybe Helena caught on to something from Pasc . ' OK , thanks . I 'll get back to you . Alan , the kid trusts you . You can talk to him . He doesn 't want to go . Yes , but this time , I think Pasc means it . Which do you want first ? The kid or his blood ? Both . ( Doves cooing ) ( Breathing heavily ) ( Alan ) How are you doing ? Hey , now they 're not supposed to be let out . Come on . He 'll fly back when he needs something to eat . Hey , cobber , we 've got a very big problem . Pasc is going to kill Dr Russell unless he gets you back . He will kill anyway . He can 't help it . None of us can . We have ... the killing sickness . Etrec ... Dr Russell tried to tell us something . Pasc wouldn 't let her . Raul thinks Dr Russell wanted him to get a sample of your blood . It 's something to do with the killing sickness . An Archanon cannot give his blood . Look , I 'm not a doctor . I don 't understand , but ... this could be something good - save your life and Pasc 's . An Archanon cannot give blood . An Archanon can only kill ! Can you kill me , cobber ? ( Knife slashing flesh ) Etrec , what have you done ? I wanted to cut the sign from my forehead . You asked for Archanon blood . This is yours . ( Beeping ) Haven 't you got Eagle 1 yet ? - No , sir . - Keep at it . ( Whirring ) I 'm picking up a signal . - Eagle 1 ? - Alien . ( Woman ) 'Moonbase Alpha . Moonbase Alpha . 'Are you receiving , Moonbase Alpha ? 'Come in , Moonbase Alpha . 'Moonbase Alpha , come in , please . ' - This is Alpha . Who are you ? - ' Permission to land . ' Identify , please . Get her on the big screen . 'I am from Archanon . We 're concerned for your safety . 'Two Archanons have been freed and can be a danger to you . 'I need permission to land . ' You have it . ( Beeping ) Yes , Alan ? 'We 've got the blood and something else that will interest you . ' Be right with you . Etrec sent for this . It tells the whole story . ( Alan ) That 's Lyra , Etrec 's mother . '402-11-1 . 'It has happened again - that which we of Archanon dread above all . 'The terrible scourge we thought we had eradicated 'from our genes has returned . 'Pasc has the killing sickness . ' We 've got to tell Pasc that we know . - Quick . We 've a battle here , too . - OK . - ' Pasc . ' - So ... They have come to their senses . - You have Etrec ? - ' We have . ' Hurry and you will have your doctor back . - ' A moment , first . ' - I cannot wait . ( Tony ) ' Pasc , look at this . ' ' .. dread above all . 'The terrible scourge we thought we had eradicated has returned . 'Pasc has the killing sickness . 'Lok and Kerak are dead - 'destroyed by Pasc in the meaningless violence this disease engenders . 'I , Lyra , have taken command . 'Pasc has been overpowered . 'I have ordered the preparation of a stasis chamber . 'Pasc will be placed in stasis , where he will remain ... 'until a cure for the killing sickness can be found . 'Since it is known ... that the sickness is passed on 'in the genes of the male line ... 'I have ... I have no alternative ... 'but to place in stasis with Pasc , my ... ' .. my son , Etrec . 'I pray ... 'that one day he will be able to give me ... 'his forgiveness and understanding . ' Let me see Etrec . 'What have you done to him ? ' - Nothing . He gave us his blood . - ' You took his blood ? ' He took it himself . He gave it freely . We have confirmation , Doctor , this virus can be cured with a serum ... - What 's the matter with Etrec ? - ' He 's not replacing any blood . ' It is over . Unless this Eagle is released , Dr Russell will die . 'All right , Pasc . You have control . ' - ( Beeping ) - ( Computer ) ' Launch pad activated . ' I have lost Etrec . There is nothing left now . Nothing to wait for . You may go . The boy need not die . A blood transfusion would ... My blood - with the active virus . Your blood , after it 's been treated , will mate with Etrec 's blood . You 're the only one that can save him . I do not save life . I take it . - Even your own son 's ? - Even my own son 's . You couldn 't do it before . You cannot do it now . I can . I will . I must . The sickness can be cured . It 's just that your people have accepted it all these generations ... - Are you afraid ? - It 's too late . It isn 't , if you 'll give your blood . It 's too late , I tell you ! He cannot be saved . Now get out , or you 'll go with me . All right . Start your engines . Leave your son to die . We 're coming out . ( Beeps ) - Yes ? - ' The Archanon ship has landed . ' Have them brought straight here . It 's worked . The virus has been destroyed . He 's doing nicely . Heart , blood pressure steady . He 's failing . Stimulators . A ... A waste ... A waste of time ... The heart will not pump what is not ... there . Save your strength . How ... is ... my ... son ? The virus is destroyed . He 's a true Archanon again . A peace bringer . Good . Pasc ... Pasc ... Oh ... ( Laboured breathing ) Pasc ! Do not leave me . You ... You ... can return now ... to Archanon ... to your own . But ... how ? They will come for us both . But they will find only you . Clean and free from the sickness . It ... is good . ( Door opens ) Lyra . Pasc . Lyra is gone these 1,000 years . I am Maurna , but of Lyra 's line . Peace to you , Maurna ... of Lyra 's line . I give into your care ... your kinsman , Etrec . Take him with you to Archanon . You know I cannot , Pasc . There is still no place on Archanon for the sickness . Etrec no longer has the sickness . We prepared a serum and gave him a transfusion using Pasc 's blood . Yes . We know of this process on Archanon . You could have cured Pasc and didn 't ? We knew of the cure but could not use it . No Archanon can give that amount of blood and live . You knew this ? It 's the last privilege ... of the killing sickness ... to kill oneself . ( Groans ) Pasc ! ( Etrec sobbing ) Come , Etrec . We 're going home . Hey , cobber . I got something for you to back home with you . Now remember - two eyes , two hands . Thanks , Alan . - But ... - Oh , come on . Just a beat-up old football . Anyway , we 're mates , aren 't we ? See you . It 's an old Earth symbol which means ... I 'm glad I met you . Can I stay with Pasc ... for a time ? OK . - Glad to have you back , John . - Glad to be back . I 'm sorry I wasn 't around to help with all that flak flying around . Alan says I would have liked Etrec . Mm . You would have . You would have liked Pasc too , under ... different circumstances . Helena ... You can 't blame yourself for what happened . Pasc is dead . You 're a doctor . You did what any other doctor would have done . Pasc knew what would happen . You didn 't know . As a doctor , I should have known . Besides , it 's not a very satisfactory defence - ignorance . You saved the boy . Yeah , I do have that to be grateful for . Etrec . Is that all you have to be grateful for ?

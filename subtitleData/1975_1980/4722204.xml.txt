 'The year is 1987 'and NASA launches the last of America 's deep-space probes . 'In a freak mishap , Ranger 3 and its pilot , Captain William " Buck " Rogers , 'are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life-support systems 'and returns Buck Rogers to Earth 500 years later . ' ( Buck ) The Ruathans are honouring the truce . They 're allowing ships through their blockade . So Madrea is able to get the supplies ? - ' But they 're not exporting much barbarite . ' - We 're well aware of that . You look like something the cat dragged in . Why is it that for once I know exactly what you 're talking about ? - Negotiations aren 't going well ? - Not at all . If the Ruathans reinstate a full blockade around Madrea , we must declare war . Have a little faith in Theo . He can talk the quills off a porcupine . You know that . I do ? 'Here . Maybe this will cheer you up . ' - You like it ? - ' It 's beautiful . ' It 's yours . At least it will be after dinner tonight at my place , 1900 hours . Having you check out Madrea was my idea . I owe you the favour . I was hoping you 'd say that . I 'm picking up something on the distress channel . - ' I 'll call you when I land . ' - Deering out . 'This is Earth Starfighter 1314 . Can I be of assistance ? ' ( Woman ) Our orbit is decaying . The power units are down . We have no repair equipment , we 're drifting . I 've got a fix on you . I 'm on my way . - He sounded good-looking . - You say that about every Terran . No , this one had a nice , good-looking voice . - Why don 't you switch on video , OK ? - OK . But ten credits says he 's fat and has a nose like a subspace relay . OK . This is Earth Starfighter 1314 . I 'm approaching at 50 degrees . This is the space yacht Aurora . We have you on scanner . ( Mouthing ) Do you have video transmission capability ? 'Sure do . 'How 's that ? ' Fine . Couldn 't be much better . 'What can I do for you ? ' My sister and I were hoping you could give us a tow back down to Zantia . - That 's our home . - ' Zantia 's a closed colony . 'Earth ships aren 't allowed to land there . - ' I can come and check out your engines . ' - No , a tow is all we 're after . Right now , anyway . The Zantian authorities will let you in , I 'm sure . After all , we 're natives . And this is an emergency . 'OK . Stand by for a tractor beam and I 'll see you in the spaceport . ' Ten credits , Linea . You owe me ten credits . - No , I don 't . - Don 't you think he 's good-looking ? No . I think he 's gorgeous . 'Earth Starfighter 1314 to Zantia Landing Control . ' 'You are trespassing in Zantian space . ' I have a disabled ship in tow , the yacht Aurora . Request clearance . 'Earth ships are categorically denied clearance . ' The Aurora has no power . Would you rather I cut it loose and let gravity take it down ? 'One moment . ' 'You 're to follow the yellow landing tracer to Docking Area 2 . 'Variation from that course will result in your destruction . 'Zantia landing control out . ' Thanks . Welcome to Zantia . What happened , my dears ? I just got word you had to be towed in . The power units went out and we had no repair equipment on board . That can 't be . I had it out to inspect only yesterday . And you left it in the maintenance bay , didn 't you , Uncle ? Oh , my . I 'm sorry . This is the man who towed us in . - We haven 't even met . - Properly , that is . - I 'm Nyree . - Buck Rogers . I 'm her sister , Linea . - And this is our uncle . - Cassius Thorne . I 'm afraid it 's my fault these two were stranded . - I 'm sorry for the inconvenience . - That 's OK . But the controller doesn 't want me around so I 'd better make it short . But you have to let us thank you . Uncle , you have friends at the Spaceship Authority . Tell them to let him stay . Just for ... tonight . - I did have plans back on Earth . - ( Nyree ) Can 't they wait ? Very few Earth men get to see the things on Zantia that we can show you . - Is that right ? - It 's settled then . I 'll speak to the controller . Linea , you make the dinner arrangements . Nyree , you show him around . Sounds good to me . Don 't wear him out , Nyree . He 's got a big night ahead of him . We deserve a bigger cut for this one , Cassius . - He 'll bring a fortune . - You may be right . In fact , I think the prime minister should have a look at this one . Since the ineptitude of your human associates seems to have rubbed off on you , Theopolis , let me once again state the central fact . There 's no need to be abusive , Mr Devronin . ( Devronin ) Ruathans , not Earth people , settled Madrea . Therefore , the planet belongs to us . With all due respect to your view , Mr Devronin , the Madreans would like to decide for themselves who rules them . Let 's stay with the facts , shall we , Dr Huer ? The Earth has grown dependent on Madrea for barbarite . How will your generators function without barbarite ? Our Federation will not turn the Madrean sector over to you . We made that clear . That 's it , Dr Huer , Theopolis . Think about it . Think about the blockade we have around Madrea and how critical Earth 's shortage of barbarite will become . I think a recess is in order . I 'm going to return to our starcruiser . I expect to hear from you within 12 hours . Your shuttle is fuelled and ready for takeoff in the main hangar . - There 's an escort standing by . - I should hope so . ( Theopolis ) Twiki , I 'd like to go to the Computer Council Chamber . - You got it . - There are refreshments in the other room . Help yourself before you leave . Bidibidi . You turkey . Look who you 're messing around with , bozo . We 're in a very unfortunate position . All we can threaten to do is go to war . If , however , the Ruathans are not honouring the truce ... Buck said the corridor to Madrea is open . - Fine . Thank him for the report . - I will . - He 's cooking dinner for me tonight . - Oh , I 'm sorry . My , my , my . - Here we are . - Sorry to keep you waiting . Think nothing of it . So this is where you ladies live ? - Yes . - No . I live here . Linea lives in Tower 4 . Why don 't you push on some music while I fix everyone some drinks ? I hope Centauran brandy is all right with everyone . It 's always been my favourite . I guess I 'm being a little selfish . Let me get that . You 're our guest . You should let us serve you . If I didn 't take pleasure in doing it , I wouldn 't . Here you are . There 's one for you . And one for you . Bottoms up . I brought him here because I knew he was the one you 've been looking for . You like ? I 'll be back in an hour . I want him removed by then . According to your law , he must go through the same process as the others . You 'll have plenty of time to think of all the money you 're going to make on him . Right now I 'd worry about taking care of him . And fast . He knows something 's going on in there . That 's what I like about him . ( Woman ) Ariela ! Ariela ! The prime minister sitting on a horse instead of her hands . - This must be important . - Stop it . You 're impossible to reach these days . In more ways than one . I had to talk to you before tomorrow . What ? About the opposition I 've been organising against you ? - Then the rumours were true . - Mother , we 're not really opposing you . It 's your policies . Keeping our planet isolated . Making outworlders believe there are men here when there are so few . - And passing those contemptible laws . - Out of necessity . - Out of fear . - I 'm doing what 's best for Zantia . Best ? Mother , I 'm ashamed to live here . We 're repeating ourselves . That 's not what I came here to do . I 've found a man for you . - He 'll be brought to you tomorrow . - No . - I won 't go along with that . - Yes , you will . It 's the law . In all honesty , I 've never met anyone quite as funny as you . There . The last of the brandy . No , thank you . - Please ? - No . Here , you drink it . 'Maybe later . ' Surely you 're hungry by now . No . No . I 'd like to know what I 'm doing here . For the past hour , you two have been saying , " Eat this , drink that , smell those . " Tell me what it is you want with me . That 's easy . We want you for local consumption , as it were . Whatever that means , I don 't like it . Is it something I said ? You 're just in this for the kicks . Be careful ! We don 't want him damaged ! This is ridiculous ! Use your weapon ! You incompetent fools ! This is just what I wanted to avoid . - The wound won 't be noticeable . - It better not be . He 's going to bring us 10,000 credits at least . 10,000 ! Take it easy . How do you feel ? There 's a little man inside my head , screaming in pain . - It 's me . - I 'm Parker , captain of the Morning Star . Buck Rogers . You received a distress call from two sisters in a disabled ship , right ? We were heading to Timbil when we picked up the distress signal . Sounds familiar . Dr Macon , team archaeologist . - Doctor . - How do you do ? Anybody know what 's going on around here ? Zantia 's always avoided outworlders . Yet they seem quite well equipped to kidnap us . Interesting paradox . This is cute . It 's triggered by body heat . The closer you get , the more solid they become . Good . You are undamaged , Rogers . You 've no idea how happy that makes me . You 're really more valuable than you know . What 's this all about ? You 'll find out soon enough . You 're all going to be disposed of pretty soon . Disposed of ? Take it easy , Professor . You 'll give yourself a heart attack . Not that we 'd be losing that much , in your case . No matter what he 's got in mind , there are six of us and only two guards . - Yeah , but they 're armed . We 're not . - I still like the odds . So unless some of you want to be disposed of , listen up . This is what we 're gonna do ... Still no word from Buck , last night or this morning . - That 's not like Buck . - No . I ran his last known coordinates through central data . Take a look at the readout . Morning Star , Clarion , an Arcturan cargo freighter . They all disappeared in the same sector of space ? The same one Buck was last reported in . Doctor , Major Norris knows as much about security for the negotiations as I do . I 'm really not needed here . You should have your ship made ready for takeoff as soon as possible . - It already is . - Oh ? I like to be prepared . And Colonel ? I 'd like you both back . It 's time . Let 's go . Don 't just let them take us ! Slaughter us like animals ! No ! Please ! We have to stop them ! They 're gonna kill us , do you understand ? They 're gonna ... I suppose you had to do that to preserve your egos . Yeah . Well , so much for a good idea . Game time is over . Put the cuffs on them . Those are armed now . I wouldn 't try anything else if I were you . You mean these are ... ( Hissing ) Are you ready to move quietly now ? Ariela , you must convince her to do something ! It 's no use ! Mother will keep pretending there are as many men here as women . She thinks it 's better to do nothing than risk making things worse . But we must confront the Ruathans ! That 's something we have to do , not my mother . You 've found an army all of a sudden ? My mother 's found a mate for me . I 've discovered that he 's a Terran pilot . His starfighter is in the spaceport . - A starfighter ? - Fully functional and ready to fly . What would happen if we used it to kidnap an extremely important Ruathan ? We could bargain for the release of the prisoners . Exactly . Parker , you 're first . ( Cheering ) - Did you hear that ? - Sounds like a crowd cheering . - Gladiatorial games ? - No , I don 't think so . - ( Man counting ) - Oh , my Lord . Listen to that chanting . I knew it . Human sacrifice . ( Applause ) Your turn , Rogers . All right . We 've a first-class specimen here . Superb physical condition , high intelligence , obviously a born leader . Some lucky woman is going to have her hands full trying to tame this one . Good grief . Ladies , please get ready . We start the bidding at 400 . A very low bid to start with on the prime Terran male . 400 . Five . I see five in the audience . Do I hear more ? 800 . That 's more like it . This is a valuable property here . Our psych scanners show an extremely high intelligence quotient , unusual sensitivity , compassion , a ready wit and a strong ethical character . And 400 more . 1,200 . Do I see more ? This is a specimen you could hardly afford to pass up . This is degrading . I 'm worth more than that . Ladies , this prime Terran male is an excellent investment . 1,600 from the unseen lady on monitor 4 . Do I see more ? - Move around . - What ? Move around . Show ' em the merchandise . Blow it out your nose , Thorne . All right . Ladies , I am shocked and appalled . 1,600 is a joke ! This is a young , attractive , healthy specimen . 2,200 ! That 's more like it . Do I hear more ? A higher bid , please . Don 't worry . I won 't let you go for less than 5,000 . Thanks . I appreciate that . 3,000 on the monitor from bidder number four . Do I hear more ? The bid is now 4,000 . Do I hear five ? - 10,000 ! - I 'm gonna get this one . 12,000 ! Going once ... Going twice ... 20,000 ! An excellent bid . Do I hear more ? Going once at 20,000 ... Going twice at 20,000 ... Sold to bidder number four , for 20,000 credits . You should be flattered . You fetched the highest bid we 've ever got here . - Of which you get 10 % , right ? - 15 . I have enormous overhead . - Let 's go . - Where to now ? Where else ? To meet your new mate . Mate ? Bidibidi . Bidibidi . Get your red hots . Get ' em while they last . Here . - What is he talking about ? - I 've stopped asking . - You look like leftover dinners . - Thank you , Twiki . - We appreciate that . - Bidibidi . Any time . - Have you heard from Colonel Deering ? - About 20 minutes ago . She just left Stargate 20 and was entering the Tauran system . She should be in Zantian space by now . Bidibidi . Lucky stiff . - Stiff ? What 's a stiff ? - You don 't want to know . Earth Starfighter 4332 to vessel in distress . Can you copy ? 'This is the space yacht Aurora out of Zantia . 'Sorry to bother you . We had some temporary flux in our starboard engine . - ' It 's clear now . ' - ' Faulty discharge tube . I replaced it . ' You might have exhausted all your options before sending out a distress signal . 'Sorry . We just didn 't think . 'Thank you for responding . Aurora out . ' One good distress signal deserves another . ( Wilma ) Zantia landing control , this is Earth Starfighter 4332 . - I have an emergency . Please respond . - ' You are trespassing in Zantian space . ' I have an emergency . My stabilisers are crippled . 'Earth ships are categorically denied clearance at Zantia 's spaceport . ' All I need is a few hours to repair my ship . 'Earth ships are categorically denied clearance at Zantia 's spaceport . ' If I don 't land , I 'll crash . - ' Earth ships are categorically denied ... ' - .. clearance at Zantia 's spaceport . I know . I don 't have time to join you in another chorus . I 'm landing on your planet . If you want to shoot down a vessel in distress , fine . But don 't be surprised when the Defense Directorate marches in with fighters . I 'm Ariela Dyne . And you 're Buck Rogers . So what ? I 've just about lost patience with this . Your auction was almost funny but I 'm tired of being led around like a prize bull . - I don 't blame you . - What ? Don 't you want to look at my teeth ? I don 't like this either , Captain . I 'd rather live alone than buy a mate . The plain fact of the matter is ... ( Beeping ) - Come with me . - Why should I ? I said come with me . Please . - What was that all about ? - We were being monitored in there . - By whom ? - Probably my mother . Or someone who knows I oppose my mother 's policies . My mother 's the prime minister of Zantia . It 's beautiful out here . Reminds me of summers in Colorado . - A long time ago . - Yeah , it is beautiful here . We had to fight to keep it like this . The Ruathans tried to invade us . - Really ? - I think we embarrassed them . Drove them back into space . Fought them to a standstill . But most of the men of Zantia were either killed or taken prisoner . So you hired Cassius Thorne to lure me in here and repopulate the planet ? Why not just ask for men ? You 'd have lots of volunteers . We couldn 't . If it were known that Zantia was a world without men , we 'd be invaded . - Surely you have enough women pilots . - Not enough . For years , we let the men handle the defences . Suddenly the men were gone and there weren 't enough of us to train new people . So you went on with the pretence that your Zantian men were alive and manning the defences ? We can 't do it forever , no matter what my mother thinks . I hate the lies , and I hate what we do to people like you . You can negotiate with the Ruathans . Earth would help . There 's a better way . We know the Ruathan leader is on Earth right now . - We ? - Others who feel as I do . And we know the Ruathan negotiator uses a simple shuttle to transport himself from his starcruiser to New Chicago . With your ship , we could intercept him . - Where does that leave me ? - If you get me into Earth 's solar system , I 'll drop you at whatever space station you wish . No . You 're no pilot . You 'd be no match for the Ruathans . - If I go with you , I go all the way . - Why ? I like you . Takes a lot of chutzpah to do what you 're doing . Chutzpah ? What is that , a disease ? - What 's this ? - Some kind of mineral . - Seems to be quite common . - Looks like barbarite . ( Neighing ) Stop her ! She heard us ! A laser fence . Perfect timing , whoever she is . She was one of the ladies bidding on me . - She could ruin our plans . - Unless we leave immediately . Let 's go . Buck is definitely here at Zantia . His ship was at the spaceport . You think he 's being held by the Zantian government ? This place is like an armed camp . I had to " borrow " a uniform to get past the guards at the spaceport . - How are negotiations going ? - They 've recessed for an hour . I 'm afraid that 's the best I can say about it . Dr Theopolis is pessimistic . Very well . Make sure they 're ready . I gotta go . I think I 've got a lead on Buck . Deering out . Dr Theopolis , would you perhaps like to pay a social call to Mr Devronin ? To keep the communication lines open , more or less . The two of you should have a great deal in common . Not as much as you might think , Doctor . But I 'll certainly try . And Twiki can have a conversation with Mr Devronin 's bodyguard , Karsh . - Bidibidi . Stuff that . - Stuff that ? What ? - He said he 'd love that . - In a pig 's eye . Does that mean you don 't want to speak with Mr Karsh ? - You got it . - They 're not on the best of terms , Doctor . I wouldn 't advise further contact between them . Why ? What 's happened ? Let 's just say that on their last encounter , Twiki lived up to his name . Bidibidbidi . I gave him a tweak he 'll never forget . Tweak , tweak . ( Chuckling ) I knew my daughter opposed me but didn 't know she 'd actually commit treason against me . I know this must come as a great shock to you but I do have the recordings to prove it . How is it you came to be spying on my daughter ? I 'd rather not say , Prime Minister . You 'd rather not say . And what do you expect to gain from telling me this ? Just the knowledge that I 've helped my world . And I want the Terran pilot , Buck Rogers . I might have known . Well , he 's yours . When we find him . Inform the spaceport that I want a security cordon around the Terran starfighter . If and when my daughter arrives , I want her brought to me . Unharmed . - Don 't move . - I wouldn 't think of it . That pendant you 're wearing belongs to a friend of mine . - Where is he ? - I really don 't know . I think you do . I 'll give you 30 seconds before I fry you inch by inch from the bottom up . He 's with Ariela Dyne at her home outside the city . - Then that 's we 're going . - You don 't need me to take you there . I 'll diagram its location . Have you heard of a grilled cheese sandwich ? - No . - A friend of mine told me about them once . Let 's say you 're the bread . Hold it over a fire for two or three minutes . I 'm going , I 'm going . They won 't stay unconscious for long . Let 's get out of here . Move ! Hang on . Sorry . Nobody home . Don 't move . I 'm looking for my friend Buck Rogers . - Where is he ? - Tell her about the grilled whaddyacallit . - You 're too late . - What ? What 's happened to him ? You 'd better worry about yourself , lady . Those are the prime minister 's guards . I 'm more of an asset than you thought . The Ruathan negotiator is escorted every day by Earth starfighters . - I know that . - If you approached , they 'd shoot first . - But they 'll ask me questions first . - Then they 'll open fire . The idea is to do away with that part . - But you 're taking a big chance . - I call it a calculated risk . - Thank you . - That 's a little premature . - The worst is yet to come . - That 's why I 'm saying it now . You must let me go . You lied in order to land on our planet . You deliberately disobeyed our laws and trespassed . And you 're in league with a man who started a gun battle in our spaceport . And yet I 'm simply to let you go ? Please , if what the woman in your daughter 's apartment says is true , Buck and Ariela are going to try to kidnap the Ruathan negotiator . - What chance do they have of succeeding ? - A very good one . Buck is familiar with all our security procedures and he knows the pilots who are flying escort personally . My daughter could actually do this ? Yes , she could , which is sure to end the negotiations . Earth will lose what 's become our primary source of barbarite and Zantia will be open prey once Ariela exposes your vulnerability . They must be stopped . - The question is how ? - Buck is flying two people in his starfighter . I could catch up to him in mine and stop him . Somehow . See that Colonel Deering gets to her spaceship as quickly as possible . Thank you . And Colonel ? Even though my daughter ... Even though my daughter is with Rogers ... do whatever must be done . Soon we 'll be able to see the Ruathan starcruiser . How do we know the negotiator will be en route ? We don 't . But it 's mid-afternoon on Earth . The meeting should break up soon . We 'll wait for him up here . Entering stargate . There 's the starcruiser . 570,000 kilometres and 50 degrees starboard . Hello ... - ls that the shuttle ? - 165 degrees port . You must bring good luck . We 'll know that for sure pretty soon , won 't we ? Hang on . Earth Starfighter 1314 to escort leader . Buck Rogers to escort leader . Do you read ? Leader to ES 1314 . I 've got you on the scanner . - Is that Major Norris ? - Affirmative . What are you doing up here ? There 's been a change of plans due to an emergency . Mr Devronin 's shuttle is to dock with my ship . ( Devronin ) I heard that , whoever you are . Your request is totally ridiculous . I have no intention of doing anything but getting back to the company of non-Terrans . It 's not a request , sir . I 'm ordering you to prepare for boarding . - ' Wait a minute , Captain . ' - ' There 's no time to explain . ' - Don 't listen to him , Major . - Wilma ? I can 't let you do this , Buck . - ' Colonel Deering , what 's going on ? ' - ' Buck is trying to kidnap Mr Devronin . ' - What ? - ' Buck , clear this vector in three seconds . ' - ( Buck ) Don 't try to stop me . - You 'll force Earth and Ruatha to go to war . 'You 're jeopardising thousands of lives . 'If you were within my range , I 'd shoot you down . Clear out , please . ' Major Norris , you know I 'm capable of destroying this entire escort . - ( Norris ) ' Colonel Deering ... ' - There 's too much at stake , Major . Open fire . Full pulsars . - Wilma , I know what I 'm doing . - You 're sending us right into war ! 'Wilma , you know me . Trust me ! ' He 's hit . - I 'm going to finish him . - No ! Ceasefire ! - ( Norris , sighing ) With pleasure . - Are you all right ? ( Buck ) Yeah , we are . But my starboard defence shield 's a mess . - Nice shooting , Major Norris . - Very funny , Captain . What is going on here ? I want that man executed . I suggest you do as he told you and prepare for boarding . I 'll have you executed , too . I 'll have all seven of you executed . Seven pulsar cannons say you should worry about that later . All we 're going to do is rap . I beg your pardon ? Dr Huer , I think you should pick up subspace channel L3 . Some disturbing transmissions are coming in from Deering and Rogers . She 's found him ? Good . Where are they ? What are they doing ? Bidibidi . Don 't ask . They were threatening to destroy the Ruathan negotiator shuttle . - What ? - But now it appears they simply boarded it . Boarded it ? Surely you must be making some kind of mistake . Bidibi . Fat chance . What is the meaning of this ? Colonel Deering , you should know this is tantamount to a declaration of war . Mr Devronin , this is Captain Buck Rogers . He can explain everything . I hope . 'Huer to Ruathan space shuttle . Come in , please . ' Patch him through . Let 's get this over with . - ' Dr Huer , we read you . ' - Buck ! What on earth is going on ? 'Just a little impromptu negotiating . ' Holy Toledo , Doc . Mr Devronin , this is Ariela Dyne . She 's from Zantia . You remember Zantia ? It 's an insignificant little planet of insignificant humanoids in the Taurus solar system . Two years ago , the Ruathans invaded Zantia and killed or captured most of the male population . Again I ask you , so what ? I propose that all Zantian prisoners of war be returned home immediately . - In exchange for ... ? - Madrea . 'The Earth will relinquish all claim to that colony , 'provided that the Madreans be allowed to leave . ' - He 's insane ! - ' Rogers is determined to cut Earth off ... ' Ariela , would you tell Wilma where I found this , please ? ( Devronin ) If anything happened to me - ls this what I think it is ? - I hope . - Zantia ? - ( Theopolis ) ' I must consult with others ... ' That 's a luxury your alleged friend is not affording us . - Buck , I implore you ... - Dr Theopolis , Dr Huer . Buck knows what he 's doing . Trust him . Make mine a double , Twiki . 'Docking tubes 5 through 10 cleared ... ' If the Ruathans had known there was more barbarite on Zantia than Madrea - they 'd never have agreed to your terms . - And they wouldn 't be releasing prisoners . The Madrean miners are coming here in droves . Our male population is booming . I thought they 'd emigrate here . No one 's too crazy about living on Madrea . Besides , the scenery 's much nicer here . 'The Ruathan shuttle has docked . Please keep the area clear . 'Repeat , please do not enter Docking Area 2 . 'Stay in the main concourse . ' - What will happen to your mother ? - She 's been removed from office . She and Cassius Thorne will be tried by the new leadership . My mother legalised kidnapping . She made the buying and selling of men a way of life . Yet she honestly thought she was doing the right thing . Jayel ? Well , I guess I 'll come back next week and say goodbye . I 'm sure they 'd appreciate that . - Besides , you have a dinner date tonight . - I do ? Oh , I do . Have I introduced you to the ancient delicacy known as sweetbreads ? Mm-mm . Sounds good . What is it made out of ?

 This is silly . The party isn 't until tomorrow night . But it 's fun . What do you think ? You look marvellous . - I wonder ... ? - What ? Well , your hair . Instead of the curls , you once had it kind of twisted around . And I happen to know that Tony liked it that way . Tony ? Who cares what Tony thinks , anyway ? ( Bleeping ) Alarm circuits going haywire . - Compute to pinpoint fault . - Section F - malfunction . - Main electronics malfunctioning . - Reset . Negative . Switch to emergency power . - Negative . - Try again . ( Clanking ) ( Alan ) Complete power loss . ( Maya ) A through G malfunction . - Life support systems ? - Malfunctioning . ( Whirring ) They will be all right . Who are you ? Where do you come from ? I am Zamara , of the planet Vega . Your small world has entered our sphere of influence . You are ... ? John Koenig , Commander of this base . We 're in your sphere of influence by accident , with no hostile intent . I accept your explanation . Thank you . Our life support systems are down . We will take action if you ... Your systems are being held in an electro force field . It may also be programmed to affect your nerve centres . To immobilise us ? Yes , as you have just experienced . - Our nervous systems are delicate . - There will be no lasting effects . And for the present , I will permit you ... minimum life support power . It will be necessary for two of you to come to Vega . - Why ? - Because it is required . I told you , we mean you no harm . - Then unlock our systems . - Commander , I 've given you enough life support for you to survive for 48 hours . You have already wasted precious minutes . You expect us to stand by while you drain our atmosphere ? You will not interfere with our plans . Don 't interfere with us and we will not interfere with you . What guarantee do I have of your good faith ? Anyone who comes with me will be returned within the time limit . You have the assurance of the people of Vega . And you have no choice . All right . I 'll go . You said you wanted two of us . I think a commander should stay with his command , and you are unsuitable . I choose you ... - and you . - Now , just a minute ... You will travel to Vega by positronic transfer . All you have to do is to freely wish it . If you value the lives of your friends on Alpha , you will do it . You are holding back . Keep concentrating . Want it . Desire it . I want a line of communication kept open at all times , as you said . Communications ... normal . ( Bird squawking ) - You all right ? - You ? Yeah . Did it startle you ? Yes . Bring food for our guests . I am Zarl . May your stay on Vega be one of pleasure . Outside , the temperature is always subzero , and the atmosphere almost too thin to survive . Within the city , you will find all that you desire . This is Moonbase Alpha . Come in . This is Alpha . Come in , Dr Russell . - No answer , Commander . - Keep trying . They lied . They 're not letting us communicate . If they 'd lie about that , they 'd lie about ... Helena and Tony . - We 've got to get down to Vega . - We can 't do it without power . Isn 't it conceivable that 's it 's a simple , mechanical device that 's blocking our electronics ? Unlikely . On the off-chance , I 'm organising a search . This is Moonbase Alpha . Come in . This is Alpha . Come in , Dr Russell . ( Soothing music plays ) Refresh yourselves . ( Whispers ) Whatever happens , do not react as they expect . - Thank you . - There is no need to thank a Number . - They 're androids ? - Automatons . ( Whispers ) If you show aggression , they will kill you . Is the food to your liking ? It 's very ... unusual . You are a liar . It sticks in your throat , you decrepit hag . Won 't YOU try ? The food is delicious , Tony . Delicious . You foul-mouthed , lying cretin . ( Zarl ) You are a guest . Eat . - Guest ( ? ) - ( Zarl ) Yes . Do as you wish . Eat the food , throw it in my face , whatever you like . Call yourself a man ? Act the part . - You cringing , gutless , spineless ... - Tony ! It 's that we 're not used to hot food . Cool it . All right , this section seems clear . Let 's try Section 7 . We have heat loss , oxygen rundown . - How long do we have ? - 42 hours . - Could we rig up temporary heating ? - Any combustion would use oxygen . - A chemical reaction producing heat ? - I 'll work on it . Good . Alan ? We 've found nothing , we 've drawn a blank in every section . The power packs in the Eagles . Take a detail and get some . Do you think he 'll get through to the Eagles ? Maybe . Maybe not . We have to get power . - Maybe magnetic attraction . - Try anything . These are your quarters . Lovely . We 'll be very , very comfortable here . I 'll leave you to consider your impoliteness . And remember , time is not on your side . - Time for what ? - To do what we want you to . - Which is ? - Never mind . You will do it . Tony Verdeschi calling Moonbase Alpha . Come in , Alpha . Alpha ! It 's no use . They won 't let us get through . No . Be careful ! That 's what they want . - What 's going on ? - One of the Numbers warned me . You believe robots ? I believe that one . He said that if we show aggression , they 'll kill us . I don 't know . We need some answers . We 've got to get out of here . - We 've got to find that Number . - Right . Hey , wait a minute . Why did they let me keep a weapon ? - They want us to use it . - Maybe they didn 't find it . They 're far too intelligent for that . Anyway , here goes . Come on . ( Door opens ) We 're here as friends . You have nothing ... to fear . The one who warned me - the one who spoke - where is he ? Please , we need your help . Maybe we could help each other . - You 're NOT androids . - No . THEY are the androids . WE are the humans . Long ago , we built the first robots , linked to a powerful computer . The computer designed more advanced robots , who , in turn , built more sophisticated computers . - A self-generating system . - Yes . The cycle continued until the robots evolved to perfect humanoid form . - They 've got mechanical perfection . - Yes . Their emotions ? Human characteristics they learnt from us by example . Everything except love ... and hate . Why do you keep your faces covered ? If we are caught off guard , we will not show emotion . Why don 't they rip them off ? They can 't employ violence , never having experienced or seen it . They want to kill us , but they can 't . They don 't possess the emotions of anger and aggression . That is what they want from you . To teach them how to kill . - Because we 're a threat . - How ? They fear human ingenuity . As long as we live , there 's a chance that we might reach the Master Computer and immobilise them . Where is the Master Computer ? At the far end of Corridor 6 , guarded by an electronic barrier . Thank you . Thank you . Remember , the Vegans will do anything to make you show them violence . If you do , they will kill us all . Let 's find out about that force field . ( Zarl ) You 're wasting your time . All the power of your moonbase would not scratch it . And your primitive toy is useless against us . You were not to leave your quarters . We were worried about our friends . We were trying to get back to them . Please , release Alpha . If you 're so concerned about your friends , why don 't you go back ? You mean ... you 'd let us go ? All you have to do is wish it . - You all right ? - Where is everybody ? I don 't know . Commander ? Weapons Section ? Petrov , why aren 't you there ? Medical Centre ? Mathias ? John ? We 're the only ones on Alpha . - We can 't be ! - We are . We 're all alone . Helena , the star chart . That pulsating dot is our present position . ( Beeps ) And THAT was the position of Moonbase Alpha when we left it to go to Vega . We 're now two light years from there , and moving further away every second . Two light years ? We 'll never get back . I thought you might like some coffee . Yeah . Thank you . Tony , I 've been thinking . The only place that John and everybody could be is down on Vega . Yes , I know . I 've been trying to figure out the same thing . They must have transferred everybody down there . If we 're ever going to see them again , we 've got to get back there . - How ? - The same way we got there before . - By wishing it . - Oh , Helena ... Tony , try it . Please . Nothing . We can 't do it without them . John will find some way to contact us . I know he will . Yeah . Yeah , sure he will . Come on , have some coffee . It 'll help you relax . Moonbase Alpha , status report . Dr Helena Russell recording . 515 days after leaving Earth 's orbit . We don 't know what has happened to John Koenig , Alan Carter , Maya , everybody . Tony Verdeschi and I are alone here on Alpha . The loneliness is beginning to have a terrible effect . If I had taken the Dexodrol that Tony put in my coffee , I would be in deep sedation . I 'm forced to conclude that he suffered some adverse effect as we went through the time warp . I have to consider him ... unstable , and potentially dangerous . She cannot withstand the pressure . Soon . It will be soon . Yes . But it seems so cruel . You 're beginning to sound human , Zarl . Be careful . You know the dangers . Helena ? 'Helena ? Tony . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know you were sleeping . Are you all right ? I 'm all right . How are you ? Oh ... Just a little jumpy . Well , I 'm sorry I disturbed you . ( Alarm ) 'Helena ? 'Helena , answer me . 'Helena ! Helena ! ' Helena , we are losing our atmosphere . Now , don 't panic , Helena . I mustn 't run . I 've got to conserve oxygen . Don 't panic . ( Alarm stops ) Helena ... They 're getting frustrated , frightened . - We know these emotions . - Yes . And soon they will teach us how to kill . Tony , drop the gun . - Please . - Now , easy , Helena . Don 't come any closer . I only want to help you . Yes , of course you do . So you put Dexodrol in my coffee . Wait a minute . You think I drugged your coffee ? That 's why you sabotaged the life support system ? Now , Tony , listen to me , please . You 're hallucinating . I didn 't sabotage our life support . I 'd be killing myself . Why would I do that ? I don 't know why . Maybe ... loneliness ... suspicion ... fear ? No . Helena , we 're the only two people on Alpha . It must have been you . If we are the only two people on Alpha ... - If ? - .. you put Dexodrol in my coffee . Well , now who 's hallucinating ? We 're not the only people here . They think they can make us hate each other . They think they can make us hate each other , even kill each other ! How about that ? ! ( Hysterical laughter ) Bang , bang - you 're dead ( ! ) They don 't know how much we enjoy playing these games . I love it ! The party 's over , kids ! Come on out ! - Come on , Zarl , Zamara ! - Come on out , wherever you are ! - Ooh ... - A-ha ! So you think it 's a game , do you ? Oh , you mean it isn 't ? You created this complete replica of Alpha down to the finest detail ... and you lost . This time . Minus five degrees . We can 't take much more of this . Can 't you raise it ? The chemical reaction is giving off maximum heat . Can 't get through to the Launch Pad . There 's no power in the Travel Tube . I 'll bet no Eagle will have power . Is there any way we can produce power ? The force field is blocking ionic transfer . Electrical current simply cannot flow . We 've got to get to Vega . Without our scanners , we can 't even find it . Security report . There is an alien form in the recreation area . ( Classical music plays ) Zamara ? ( Music stops ) No , Commander . I did not bring them with me . - Where are they ? - Safe . - Why have you come back ? - We needed additional material . ( Inaudible ) Why do you try these stupid games ? Zarl , myself , all the Vegans , we are part of the completeness . An indestructible chain . You cannot touch us . Shakespeare . Julius Caesar . Ah . Murder . " Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend me your ears " ? - You have a retentive memory . - I viewed the pages . They murdered Julius Caesar . Why ? It was a political act . Hmm ... Then we do not want Julius Caesar . What do you want ? - Interesting . - What is ? Othello . So ... jealousy can also make humans kill . I suppose so . - And lovers feel so strongly ? - Yes , Zamara . Helena and Tony , when ... ? - That 's all I want to know . - What do you want to know ? That jealousy creates violence . That lovers can be made to feel violent enough to kill . Zamara ! Wait , wait ! It won 't work , not with Helena and Tony . Won 't work ? According to Shakespeare , jealousy is a strong passion . Only with lovers . Tony doesn 't love Helena . - Who loves her ? - I do . And the man ? Tony Verdeschi ? He 's in love with Maya . So ... Don 't you miss him ? - Wouldn 't you like to see them ? - Of course we would . Then want it . Desire it . Wish it . Concentrate . John ... How are you ? What are we going to do ? You read the play Othello ? Through you . We all did . This time ... we know the way . - Androids . They 'll try to use you . - As Othello . There is a way to beat them , if we can get to the main computer . It 's protected by a force field . Let the celebration begin . ( Birds squawk ) Maya . Soon you will make love to the woman Helena . It will enrage her lover and we will have won . - Through consuming jealousy . - Yes . It 's all there - the scheming Iago , twisting a man 's love into violent jealousy . Enough to kill . The way he looks at her . To feel something as strongly as jealousy . Can we be missing so much ? Emotion is a weakness . We can use it , but we must never become ensnared . ( Zarl ) The play begins . ( Seductive music ) Chasted as an icicle fashioned by the purest frost . I will melt thee . Make love to her . I don 't know how much longer I can take this . Hang on till Maya neutralises that computer . Kiss her . The computer has a fail-safe device . If the energy source is disturbed , the whole planet explodes . You have seen . You have been shown . Zarl , kill him ! There 's got to be a way to stop them . They 're all linked , like a chain . If we break one link ... Like Christmas tree lights . If one went out ... they all did . Kill ! Kill ! Zarl , don 't ! You 're not like them any more . Kill her . Kill her ! ( Helena ) You CAN become human . - Kill her ! - Zarl ! You 've felt tenderness , compassion . - Now feel love . - Kill her ! Take that extra step . Don 't stay a machine . Become human ! KILL HER ! Please ! ( Zamara ) No ... No . ( Piercing scream ) Zarl ... - Will your people be ... ? - They 'll be fine . You were right . I did feel ... something . - I 'm sorry , Zarl . - No , don 't be sorry . It was worth it . One ... moment ... of humanity .

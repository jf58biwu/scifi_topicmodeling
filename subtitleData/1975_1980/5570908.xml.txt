 'Moonbase Alpha Status Report . 2,409 days after leaving Earth 's orbit . 'Dr Helena Russell recording . 'Scanners have detected a mysterious object in our West Quadrant . 'Our sensors indicate an active power source inside , 'but register no life forms . ' It 's radiating some kind of energy field . How powerful ? It 's too weak to have any offensive potential . Radiation factor insignificant . - It 's highly sensitive to matter . - Let 's have a look at it . It could be some kind of robot survey device . Commander , something 's triggered an energy build-up inside it . Red alert ! Defence teams into position ! - Raise defence shields ! - Medical units - stand by . Surface Eagles to underground hangars . 'All other personnel into protective areas , and stand by . ' It 's through the shields ! ( Continuous low humming ) ( Humming grows more intense ) Helena ! The pain - it 's tearing out my mind ! HELP ME ! Maya ! Let me see that . - What 's the matter with her ? - I can 't tell . - Alibe , contact that thing . - Yes , sir . What happened to her ? I 'm not sure . Some kind of shock effect . ( Alibe ) .. this is Moonbase Alpha . Come in . Can you read me ? Come in , please . Welcome back . - Are you all right ? - Yes , I think so . - Easy now . Here we go . - That 's it . - What was that ? - A mind probe . - A mind probe ? - Yeah , it probed all of us . All of us ? When it found me it changed intensity . - It almost tore my brain apart . - Here , come on . Helena , why did it single her out ? Her physiology IS different . It could be that . Yeah . - Alibe ! Can 't you raise that thing ? - I 'm trying , Commander . Tony , Maya , I want a sensor reading on that thing . ( Alibe ) Do you read me ? Come in , please . - That probe could have killed her . - Yeah . No sign of brain damage ? None that registers . No response . That probe has burned out the data bank . - Anything , Maya ? - No more than before . A highly sensitive force field with no sign of life . Why don 't we just blast it out of space ? - Maybe . Yeah , maybe . Alibe ? - Still no response , Commander . It 's converted to raw matter . Also solidifying and expanding fast . ( Maya ) It 's a spaceship ! - Dorcons ! Dorcons ! - Maya , what is it ? - What is it ? - It 's a Dorcon spaceship . Take it easy ! It 's after me ! Alan , scan that ship . Find out what you can . Check . That light ... It was a Dorcon probe . - Take it easy ! - You don 't understand ! None of you ! It 's a Dorcon spaceship . Easy , Maya , easy . What are Dorcons ? Enemies ... - Enemies Psychons fear most of all . - Maya , you 're with us . - There 's nothing to fear . - You can 't help me ! Not against them . John , that ship 's got a meson converter on board . - Meson converter ? - What is that ? It 's a means of transforming matter into energy and reshaping it in whatever form they like . And shift it through space almost simultaneously . - So they can transport matter ? - You saw how the spaceship arrived . Commander , those are Dorcons ... the most powerful race in the galaxy . I think I 'm getting through . A signal from the alien base , Archon . Ignore it , Uncle . - Give the order to invade . - And if they resist ? They resist ? They die . And the Psychon , Malic ? It is consul Varda 's duty to take her alive . But it would please you more to see her dead ? - No , Uncle . - I know what is in your mind , Malic . Your advice is rejected . The scanner report on these Alphans show they are an intelligent race . Consul Varda , arrange it how you must . But I want that Psychon . - I shall contact them immediately . - And we shall observe . For centuries they 've pursued my people , hunting us like animals . Why , Maya ? The Dorcons control all the forces of nature except one ... death . They know that through us they can achieve immortality . Commander , promise me you won 't let them take me alive . ( Alibe ) Commander , I 'm getting a signal . 'Greetings , Commander . I am Consul Varda of the planet Dorca . 'We 've journeyed far to meet your people . ' Yes . And attacked one of my crew . 'We regret the necessity of our action . 'We needed confirmation . ' A question would have been simple and harmless . You are right . Forgive us . 'I 'll withhold forgiveness until I 'm sure of your intentions . ' Our intentions are peaceful . I represent the Imperial Archon , supreme leader of the Federated Worlds of Dorcon . All right . Now we know who you are . What do you want ? 'Your cooperation . ' We 're always ready to cooperate ... for the common good . 'But your actions so far make me doubt your intentions . ' You have a Psychon among your people . Yes , we have . 'Arrange to transport her up to our ship immediately . ' Negative . - Invade , Uncle . We waste time . - There is no need . Commander , the Psychon will tell you how futile it is to resist us . Resistance IS futile . Maya , we are not going to let them take you . Varda , thank you for demonstrating your ... PEACEFUL intentions . Do as I ask , or I will demonstrate my power . - Tony , lasers ! - Yes , sir . Arm surface lasers . 'Resistance is futile . Surrender the Psychon . ' - Prepare to launch combat Eagles . - All Eagle crews to combat stations . 'Commander , you are bringing death to your people . ' They 'll kill everyone ! You can 't stop them ! Maya ! 'Heed the Psychon , Koenig . ' - Tony ! Secure the base ! - No ! Let me go before it 's too late . - You 're not going with them . - Tony ! 'I admire your readiness to die for your principles , Commander . 'Are the rest of you prepared to die , too ? ' 'Combat Eagle Group ready for launch . ' Maintain full alert . Seal every exit throughout the base . - Security units . - In position , Commander . - Keep exits covered at all times . - Yes , sir . - Damage crews . - Standing by . - Medical has been evacuated . - Good . Maya , any movement ? Not yet . Commander , sealed doors won 't stop the Dorcons . Maya . Before , you said something about immortality . " The Psychons gave them immortality . " How ? - Our brain stems . - What ? They want your brain stem ? They don 't die as our races do . Their brain stems cease to function at a certain age . They discovered that Psychon brain stems last forever . A surgical transfer to a Dorcon brain ... is all it takes ? Yes . They want us to give you up for that ? - It 's obscene ! - Tony , I 'm the last living Psychon . They won 't leave without me . I don 't want to hear . She failed you , Uncle ! I assumed they were reasonable , Malic . We 've lost the element of surprise . We should have invaded ! Silence ! - Uncle , I wish to serve you . - I know what you wish ! You wish my death . I know . I know . But I won 't die . Will I , Consul ? You have earned your immortality , Archon . Then get me that Psychon ! Get her , Varda ! Get her . - He 's such a difficult man to serve . - He is the Archon . He 's an old man , Varda . And you want to make him immortal ? Yes , Malic . It seems you are fated to remain heir to the throne and nothing more . And you approve ? Yes , Malic . You are not fit to lead our people . We shall see , Consul . We shall see . Action stations ! Select target ! John ! Energy build up . Target selected . Fire ! Fire , target two . Laser batteries knocked out . Perimeter areas 4 , 6 and 9 destroyed . Launch Eagles ! 'That craft is shielded , we can 't touch it . ' Get away from it , Alan ! 'We 've lost Eagle Four . ' Back off , Alan ! Back off ! Get back ! This way . Here we go , let me see . Commander ! We 've got to give in ! Commander , we can 't take any more ! Commander , let them have Maya ... - Why should we all die for her ? - He 's right , Commander . - No , Maya . - Give her to the Dorcons ! - Put that laser down , Stewart ! - Let them have her , Commander . - I 've got it ! - Helena ! Kill me . - I can 't , Maya . - Maya ! If I 'm dead , they 'll leave . Use the laser , Helena , please . Helena ! Do you want to see me like a living husk ? Do you ? I will be if they take me alive ! Kill me ! Please ! Helena ! - Alibe , contact them . - Yes , sir . Varda ! Call off the attack ! 'You know our terms , Commander . ' Here she is , Varda ! The last living Psychon . Call off the attack or she dies ! 'And you lose ! ' Cease bombardment . OK . We 've stalled them for now . Activate the meson converter . Pinpoint the area where they hold the Psychon . - Located . - Lock in the converter . Locked . Alert Group One for immediate action . Eight perimeter stations gone . One ship , one pilot lost . Thompson , Eagle Four . That 's two dead , eleven injured , two missing . People injured ... killed ... It 's all my fault . No , Maya . The Dorcons are to blame , not you . They won 't go away . It 's a waste . - They won 't go away . - I know . John ! Maya , transform ! No ! Commander , tell your people that you have capitulated and that we are not here to harm them . Please . This is Commander John Koenig . 'Alpha has been invaded by superior military force . 'We have no choice but surrender . ' You 'll be safe , providing you stay at your posts . 'Remain calm . ' Await further instructions . Thank you . The Psychon ... where is she ? We have the means to find her . Painful means . So , please , if you wish to spare her . Spare us your concern , Consul ! As you wish . Stop it ! You 've found her . Just stop the beam ! I 'm sorry it had to happen this way . But I did warn you . - You have what you want . - Yes , Commander . And your people have suffered enough . We shall leave you in peace . - Varda . - Goodbye , Commander . Switch off the transporter beam . Koenig ! - Commander ! - Psychon ! - You cannot escape , Psychon . - Consul Varda ! - The Psychon ? - Yes , Archon . Speak , child . What are you called ? Maya . Daughter of Mentor . Well , Maya , daughter of Mentor , your struggles are over . Prepare her for transfer surgery . The alien Commander . Kill him ! - I gave my word he would live . - Then send him back . Immediately ! I will be rid of these creatures . I shall , Archon , the moment the converter has recharged . Yes , yes . And Consul Varda ... Congratulations . Secure him . - So you got the Psychon ? - Yes , Malic . Wait ! You will carry out the brain stem transfer ? No , Malic . We went to that trouble for no reason ( ! ) He 's an old man , Varda . Let him die . So you can be the Archon in his place ? I am his HEIR . It is my right . He gives us peace and stability . What do you offer , Malic ? To you , Varda , whatever you ask ... IF you let him die . And bring war and misery and disaster upon our people ? No , Malic . The Archon may not be perfect , but unlike you , the interests of our people are his chief concern . You will regret this , Consul . Deny Excellency Malic access to the Archon until further notice . 'Yes , Consul . ' A brief moment of pain and it will be over . - Are you sure she can 't transform ? - Not while the beam is active . - Inform me when you are ready . - Yes , Consul . Consul . Release him . - Where is she ? - Forget the Psychon , Commander . - What have you done to her ? - Transfer requires preparation . - Then she 's still alive ? - Yes . If it 's any comfort , she won 't suffer . No , she 'd need a mind for that , and she won 't have one , right ? - I understand your bitterness . - Sure you do ! The security of an empire is at stake . One that controls thousands of inhabited worlds . What is the life of one Psychon compared to that ? Are you justifying your actions to me or yourself ? Meson beam ready to transport , Consul . Stand by . It 's time to go back to your own people , Commander . - I 'm sorry , Excellency . - You refuse ME entry to the Archon ? Consul Varda 's orders , Excellency . Meson converter ... a machine that transmits matter . I 'm impressed , Consul . Anti-matter coils recharged . 60 seconds to full power . - Anti-matter ? - Its energy source , Commander . Nature 's own demon , caged . Unleashed it could tear space itself apart . Ready for transfer surgery , Consul . Excellent . As soon as the beam is functional , send him back . If he resists , kill him . Goodbye , Commander . Ready to transport . Kill him , Excellency ! I am Malic , Commander . It seems you must die . And we 've yet to become acquainted . Sad , isn 't it ? You 're free , alien . You want the Psychon , don 't you ? You 're being too kind ... Malic . Why ? And you know what they 'll do to her there . Go ... before it 's too late . Go ! Before I change my mind . The alien has escaped . Alert the ship . ( Door opens ) Archon . It is time . Varda . I dream an old man 's dream of death and find you here to arrange my immortality . 'Archon , the alien Commander has escaped . ' I shall deal with this , Archon . No , I want you here . Have your men find him . The alien is to be killed on sight . Is that clear ? 'Yes , Consul . ' To reduce such a beautiful creature to a living husk ... - Not a pleasant thought , Consul ? - We have no choice , Archon . You must go on living . Our continuing security demands it . True . In a sense , we are both victims . The Psychon condemned to living death and I ... to life eternal . Well , let us proceed . Whatever would you do without me , alien ? Which way is the trap door , Malic ? Ah , you do not trust me . Of course I do . I do like an honest answer . ( Door opens ) You 'd better go ! The surgical area is at the end of the corridor . They 'll be removing her brain stem about now . The alien has gone berserk , Consul . He is armed and dangerous . - My men have orders to kill him . - They have failed . He is looking for you . Find him , Consul Varda . Keep him from this area . My medical officer will do what is necessary here . I am ready . ( Bleep ) ( Guard ) ' We 've searched the forward sector . There 's no sign of him . ' - Regroup at Sector D. - ' Yes , Consul . ' - Has the transfer taken place ? - In a moment it will be complete . Thank you . Malic ? It is I , Uncle . Is it over ? All over , Uncle ... for you ! But for me ... the beginning ! What are you doing ? - Where 's Consul Varda ? - I had to arrange her absence . - Malic ! Stop it ! - It 's your own fault , Uncle . You wouldn 't trust me , would you ? Tried to cheat me out of what was mine by right . Stop ! I beg you , stop ! Malic , release me ! Too late , Uncle . You 'll never know what a good Archon I 'll make . Of course , I shall keep the Psychon for myself . Well ... immortality is wasted on the old , isn 't it ? Malic ! Sleep , Uncle . Sleep . Sleep . Maya ! - Maya , all right ? - Yeah . Can you make the transporter beam ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - Let 's go . Dorcons , attention ! Attention ! 'The Archon is dead . Killed by the alien . 'As heir to the throne , I , Malic , now assume command . ' Not so crazy after all . 'Dorcon soldiers , as Archon I order you to find 'this alien murderer and kill him on sight . 'But the Psychon must be taken alive . ' Those about to live ... salute you ! ( Whispers ) Archon . Archon ! ( Varda ) Take his weapon ! - Do you know what you 've done ? - Prevented a crime . You are a destructive man , Koenig . You must die . As will she and all on your base for the crime you 've committed . - You said you 'd spare my base . - A Dorcon 's word . - You killed the Archon . - I did not ! ( Malic ) Consul ... You may kill him ... but the Psychon lives . My late uncle had a most excellent plan for her . - Varda , Malic killed him . - Finish him ! I command it . I saw him do it . He used ME as a decoy . Malic ! Soldiers , arrest Consul Varda ! No ! He killed your leader . - Of course . - Disarm her ! Murdering imbecile ! You are unfit to live ! The shield ! The anti-matter shield 's gone ! Let 's go ! - Helena ! - Maya ! Maya , are you all right ? Obey ! Obey ! I am the Archon ! I AM THE ARCHON ! She was quite a woman ... after all . Oh ! Who was quite a woman , after all ? Consul Varda . - What shape are we in , Tony ? - Repairs are well in hand , John . Compliments of the computer ... two genuine , 100 per cent imitation coffees . Thanks , Alan . You know , Maya , I was just wondering something . What ? Is there anything else in your Psychon past we need to know about ? That 's a highly improper question to ask ANY lady , Tony . I beg your pardon . You 'd better let us take care of your hands . My place or yours ? - How about Medical Center ? - Whatever you say , Doctor .

 ( oscillating tone ) Boy , am I in for it now . Sent before the White Desk again . What did I do ? The Solar Lander , you fool . You painted a mustache on it . But Orson doesn 't know I did it . Then why am I here ? If I knew that , I wouldn 't be talking to myself . Mork . Good morning , Orson . Orson- - you call me Orson to my face , but behind my back , you call me " Fatso , " " Rocket Ship Thighs , " and " Star Tush . " You forgot " Laser Breath . " ( playful honking ) Sorry , Your Immenseness . See what I mean ? These constant displays of humor are not acceptable behavior here on Ork . You 're right . We are rather a dull lot ; the white bread of the universe . Emotions have been weeded out of us for the good of the race , and you constantly make jokes . I 'm afraid that won 't do . Uh-oh . There 's an insignificant planet on the far side of the galaxy . From the fragmented reports we have on it , the people are ... well , uh ... Real nimnulls ? Exactly . That 's why I think you 'll fit in there , Mork . You 're too kind , sir . What is the name of this hellhole you 're sending me to ? Earth . Earth ? I was on Earth three bleems ago . I was sent there by a biology class to collect a specimen . I had to throw it back , though- - too small . I love that place . Well , don 't enjoy it too much . It 's not a vacation . We want you to learn all you we can about primitive societies . Your mission is to report back to me mentally about the things you learn there . And remember , this is a serious mission . You can count on me , Orson . D , D and E. Dedicated , diligent and efficient . Nanu-nanu . Nanu-nanu . MAN : I love this spot . WOMAN : It 's beautiful . You know , the reason I enjoy taking you out is you don 't put pressure on me . You don 't force me into playing that virile stud macho role , you know ? ( electronic whirring ) ( whirring slows and stops ) Aha ! ( cracking ) ( electronic whirring ) ( high-pitched hum ) Gizbah . ( high-pitched hum ) Shazbot . Ah . Only one suitcase ? You lost half my luggage , you nimnulls ! ( buzzes ) MAN : Oh , Mindy ! Stop it ! Don 't you ever do that again ! Not even if my blouse is on fire ! I can 't believe you . Three dates and you think you 've got the right to attack me like a Thanksgiving turkey ? ! Oh , I love it when you talk dirty . What ? Will you cut it out ? Now , look , You know , I liked you a lot better when you were ineffectual . I don 't even think I like you at all after tonight . Good point . I think I should take you home because I respect you . Well , I 'll drive to make sure we get to our respective homes still respecting each other . ( groans ) Well , if that 's the way you feel about it , why don 't you just walk home ? Oh ! If that 's the way you want it , I 'll be happy to walk home . Hey , wait a minute ! That 's my car ! Nanu-nanu . Father ... what are you doing out here ? This is where I was dropped off . Oh , yeah ? Well , I got dropped off , too . You don 't know what happened to me ! He just took my car ! Well , I 'm glad to have someone I can trust to walk into town with . I mean , this isn 't a confession or anything , but I only had three crummy dates with the guy and he takes my car and makes me walk ! Very interesting . Mind if I take notes ? I don 't know where he gets off ... ( Mindy continues indistinctly ) Nanu-nanu . ( clunks ) Shazbot ! Ah ! Well , here it is . Thanks a lot for walking me home , Father . I 'm afraid I hardly gave you a chance to talk , but I was just so mad . You know what I mean ? Nab , nab . My pleasure . I was sent here to learn , you know ? Well , if there 's anything I can do for you ... If it 's not too precious , a glass of water . And if it is , a quart of oil will suffice . Oh ... ( laughs ) I think I can spring for the water . Spring water . Humor . ( honking bark ) Better yet . How about a little iced tea ? When on Earth , do as the Earthlings . How are they treating you ? Do you talk to your plants , too ? Oh , yes , they 're good listeners . Especially the old ones . Yeah , I talk to my plants all the time . Keeps them young and keeps them healthy . Oh ... Your suit 's on backwards . It is ? Boy , do I feel like a clone . You 're not a priest . Who are you ? I am Mork from Ork . Nanu-nanu . Ork ? ! Yes , you see , Ork is a planet . You follow the Big Dipper till it comes to a dead end , then you hang an up . An up . Up , down , hard to tell out in hyperspace . Oh , right . I have a poor sense of direction myself . So , you 're , you 're from outer space . Yes , do you mind if I take a few pictures for the folks on the home planet ? They 'd like to get some postcards . Uh , no . Okay , watch the flookie . How did you do that ? With my Instamatic glove- - some models starting under 30 thribets . Oh ... mind if I do ? ( slurping ) The pause that refreshes . ( belches ) You drank that with your finger ! Yes . How do you drink ? With my mouth . Well , how do you talk and drink at the same time ? Must be Drool City . Now , look , whoever you are , now you can 't scare me . Now , there 's no such thing as a man from outer space . Now , I don 't know how you did those tricks , but you just better keep your distance or you 're going to hear me scream like you 've never heard anybody scream . I 've never heard anyone scream . Is that your way of saying thanks ? ( knocking at door ) Aha ! Help has already arrived , so you just stay cool , space man , or else ... ( gasps ) ( electronic pulsing ) It 's for you . Ah , my lost luggage . 50 nu-nu because my casual clothes are in there . ( high-pitched beep ) ( hums happily ) Take a hike . Scrim , scrim . Oh , I forgot . Sorry . Here we go . ( coins clank ) Keep the change . ( emits electronic " thank you " tones ) ( hums happily ) You really are from out there . No , actually , I 'm from out there . You see , out there 's not a nice neighborhood . I wouldn 't even go there during a total eclipse . An alien . You 're not going to hurt me , are you ? Hurt you ? ! No , damaging other life forms is unthinkable to us . I wouldn 't harm a harf on your choli-cho-cho . It occurs to me we have not been formally introduced . A formal introduction is at hand . ( toots fanfare ) ( mimicks crowd cheering ) Get down . I am Mork from Ork . Nanu-nanu . Oh ... I 'm , I 'm Mindy McConnell . ( toots fanfare ) ( mimicks crowd cheering ) ( baby-like ) : Ah . I like a being with a firm gribbet . Shows character . At least evolution . Oh ... Well , thank you . Uh ... how do you say thank you in your language ? We spit . Mind if I don 't say thank you ? No sweat off my front . I just , I just can 't believe this . I 'm standing here talking to an alien . Do you realize the historic sweep of this ? I mean , the world will be astounded ! No , nab , nab . You see , my mission is to observe Earth . And the only way I can do that is by being one of you , a face in the crowd . Which is easy because I fit right in . Not really . No ? No . Are you sure ? Oh , I 'm sure . I tell you what . Now , I 'm as interested in you and your planet as you are about us so how about I can teach you to act Earthling if you teach me more about Ork ? Is that a deal ? A fair exchange . Let 's formally close the deal . ( squeaks ) Mind if I just spit ? It 's your house . I will be staying here , won 't I ? I mean , I 've heard so much about your Earthling hospitality . Oh , well , you can , uh ... temporarily . Oh , but if my father finds out ... Father ? ! On Earth you have natural parents . You see , I 'm a test tube baby . Really ? Yes . My father was an eyedropper , the scum . Why would you say that ? Well , he ran away and left Mom . Ran off with a bottle of nose drops . Can 't blame him , though . She had those tight labels . ( playing " Beethoven 's Fifth " on piano ) ( repeats music phrase ) ( playing " Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony " loudly ) ( playing " Dueling Banjos " ) ( playing classical version of " Dueling Banjos " ) ( both playing lively jazz piece ) Oh , come on . Oh , come on , please , hey . Stop ! Stop ! ( whistles ) It 's too early in the morning for " Dueling Beethoven . " It 's the only music I can challenge him with , dear . He won 't play anything by Alice Cooper . That 's because I play piano . Alice Cooper just beats on the keys with a dead snake . But at least he shows feeling . Are you two going to start this again ? I am a musician . I sell violins and I sell cellos . They 're classics . That 's food for the spirit and a feast for the soul . While you peddle ... ( playing discordant note ) ... junk food . Frederick ... Huh ? If you were in Heaven and God said , " I will give you a choice- - " you can be born with brains , or you can born with a permanent rash on your fanny . " Now which would you choose ? The brains . Good . I see you learn by your mistake . Mother-in-laws are the curse of marriage . Oh , Daddy , you know she loves to tease you . It 's what keeps her young . Yes , but it 's making me old . Mindy , isn 't that your second cup of coffee ? It 's my fourth . But you don 't drink coffee . Why are you all of a sudden drinking gallons of coffee , unless you ... stayed up late . You 're right . This must be my first cup of coffee . Mindy ... Dad , I was up late last night . Dad , I met the most fascinating person . I was up half the night talking to him . Him ? Half the night ? Dad , I 'm 21 . Oh , honey , I know , I know . It 's just that I 'll always think of you as my little girl . I know you will . Hey , Mindy , look who I found wandering the streets looking for you . Correction , munchkin-like person : I wasn 't wandering , I was trying to explore your world . He 's new in town , Eugene . Mork , I 'll be happy to show you around after work . Work ? Oh , yes . Most people have to work for a living . What a novel concept . Mindy , who 's your beatnik friend ? Uh ... Daddy , this is Mork . Mork , this is Mr. McConnell . Nanu-nanu . Mork , he 's my father . What an interesting position to be in . I tip my kripla to you , sir . ♪ Doo-dah , doo-dah . ♪ Well , I guess it 's time for my violin lessons . Thank you for taking me to your leader . Gizbah . Oh , yeah . Ah , ah ... Hey , Mork , I 'd like to see you again . Were can I find you ? I 'll be at Mindy 's place . Come by any time . Hang tough , man . What it was , my main man . You 'll be at Mindy 's place ? Yes , we 're living together . ( nervous laughter ) Catch you later , Jack . On the rebound , clown . Your mama . Living together ? That 's not what it seems . Your grandmother 's the one with the hearing problem . I distinctly heard him say you were living together . Oh ... oh , well , Mork ... Mork is a practical joker . You heard his voice , right ? And with a name like Mork , you 'd be a practical joker too , right ? Oh , then he 's not staying in your , uh ... and he 's not sleeping in your , uh ... No one is sleeping in my , uh ... Oh . And no one is sleeping there either . ( honking bark ) ( honking bark ) A pie in the face . How did you Earthlings think of something so original , so unique ? Mork , you and I have got to have a talk , so you might as well sit down and make yourself comfortable . Don 't mind if I do . Now , Mork ... today , you did a bad thing . You told my father we 're living together . Now , I know you didn 't mean to do any harm , and it 's ... What are you doing ? You said to make myself comfortable . Mork , can you take a little constructive criticism ? Of course . It 's not nice to sit on your face . Then why did God put it there ? Oh , boy , I 'll tell you- - I can tell you teaching you to be Earthling is not going to be easy . Now , if you want to pass for one of us , the first thing we 're going to have to do is we 're going to have to work on your voice . Your voice is not right . Well , how about this one ? ( Southern accent ) : You say another word , I 'll blow your lips into the sink . That one 's not quite you . Or this one ? ( as Ed Norton ) : Hey , Ralphie , boy . ( as Jackie Gleason ) : Norton , to the moon , Norton ! Or ... this one : ( as Shirley Temple ) : ♪ On the good ship Lollipop ... ♪ How did you learn those voices ? We 've been monitoring your TV for years . My favorite is : ( as Desi Arnaz ) : Lucy , you can 't do the show . ( as Lucille Ball ) : Ricky ... Babaloo ! Oh , boy . I can tell this isn 't going to be easy . Oh , Mork , you just don 't understand the problems you present . I realize I do cause trouble . Heavy sigh . The last time I was here I caused a big problem , too . You were on Earth before ? About 20 bleems ago . I was here to visit my friend the Fonz . You know him ? Hey ! Are you interested ? Oh , yeah , definitely . Then I 'll take you back . Prepare a time-warp sequence . ( phone ringing ) All right , I 'm coming . Yo . Cunningham residence . No , Richie ain 't here right now . Because he and his family went off on a little vacation jaunt , you know . Hey , you sound very adorable . What 's your name ? Mary . How are you ? Arthur Fonzarelli here- - house-sitter . You never heard of me ? You new in town or you just back from lunch ? Yes , Mary , I will tell Richie that you called . Yes . Bye-bye , Mary . I want to tell you , he knows some uninformed human beings . ( electronic pulsing ) All right , all right , all right , who 's going " wee-wee-wee " ? I said , who 's going " wee-wee-wee " ? Hey , Ralph , if you 're out there and this is a bad joke , I 'll give you 30 seconds to find out how much I don 't enjoy " wee-wee-wee . " Whoa-whoa-whoa . Greetings , Fonzie . Yabaz-abud-abid . Remember me- - Mork from Ork ? You once called me the " nutso from outer space . " I must be dreaming or something like that , you know . I mean , uh ... Of course I 'm dreaming . That 's why Mary never heard of me . Sorry , real thing . I had to zap your mind to make you forget . Didn 't want you to go Bozo City . I think I want to wake up now . Strange custom . Doesn 't give me pleasure . Don 't be afraid . I mean you no harm . Yeah , right ... No , I 'm not afraid . Oh , snacks ! I want to be your friend . Yeah , okay , look- - I 'm real sorry , you know . I mean , as much as I 'd like to invite you in to have a little small talk and everything , I got so many things to do , you know ? Like give Richie a message from Mary and clean the bugs off my headlights . Stuff like that , you know what I mean ? ( high-pitched whirring ) Hello ? I 've come for very important information . When I was here before , I observed an Earth ritual that I could not comprehend . It drove me zazbot . Well , don 't get unravel ... Hey , let 's not get unraveled here . Right . We 'll just talk about it . What is this particular ritual that made you " zizbit " ? Men dating women . Well , I think you came to the right place . What was it you wanted to know ? ( fast whirring ) Oh , thanks a lot . Why a man dates a woman . Don 't men date women on your planet ? Hard to tell ; parts are interchangeable . I don 't know how you guys got so far advanced , you know . I mean , there 's no incentive . Oh . All right , look , right off the bat , let me tell you something : It 's very difficult to talk to you like this , eh ? Don 't sit that close . Oh ! All right , now , you 're telling me that men don 't kiss women on your planet ? Kiss ? I don 't know what that means . Nice word . Has a pleasant ring to it . Kiss , kiss , kiss , kiss ... Can you hear the ring ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Look , look , all right , a kiss- - it 's very affectionate , you understand ? You got a boy and you got a girl , and they put their lips together , you see , and then they kind of slide them around . And it feels great . Sliding lips sounds unappealing . Don 't knock it till you 've tried it . All right , look , you got to meet a girl , get to know her , find out if she 's willing or not . Do you know a girl who 's willing ? I know some girls that are willing and able , and then I know some that are not willing , and you 're able to convince them , yeah . Can you introduce me to one of the convincing ones ? It 's going to be very hard . But I ... Don 't touch me . Perhaps you 'd like to slide lips then ? Hey ! But you see , I need your help . You are known throughout the universe for your expertise in this field . Oh , yeah ? Oh , yeah , that 's true . Yeah , right . All right , all right . I 'm going to try to find you a date . Hey . You just got to do me a favor . Go up to Richie 's room and get on some of his clothes so at least you look normal , huh ? You thank . My clothes do need time warping . Yeah . But first ... What ? What is Richie 's room ? Oh , yeah , you can 't miss it . Lots of stripes and checks and penny loafers . Oh , penny loafers . Yeah . Hey , take this with you . Hut . Hike . Shiznanee . But first , I remember Richie now . ( singing " Blueberry Hill " in Orkan ) He needs a lot of work . Good thing he didn 't land at Potsie 's house . All right , now who am I going to fix him up with ? Gloria Hockney ... No , I don 't want to put her in a tizzy right away . The Hoper triplets ? Now there 's a six-pack to go . No , I don 't want to put him in a tizzy right away . Hey . Same to you , buddy . Hi , Fonz . LAVERNE : What 's this guy Mork look like ? Is he tall , dark and handsome ? Yeah , you know what he is . He 's a , he 's a foreigner . Oh , I don 't like foreigners . They talk funny . Where 's he from ? Ork . Oh . Sounds like a nice country . Yeah . Laverne , listen , I just want to spend a little time with him alone , you understand , so that I can , uh , brief him on American customs , you understand . Why don 't you wait in the car ? My car broke- - I took a bus . Yeah , I 'll fix your car . Why don 't you wait on the bus , all right ? Thanks very much . I 'll give you two minutes . ( muttering ) Where is she ? If she 's here , she must be tiny . I want to get a few things straight with you , all right ? Number one ... What are you doing ? I 'm straightening things out . I start with my legs , then go to my arms . I 'd do my neck except I 'd cut off the blood . I 'd probably die . Stop that . I want to talk to you about kissing again , all right ? I 've been meaning to ask you about that . I want to know why I would want to do it . Physical pleasure . Don 't you do anything on your planet that includes physical pleasure ? Yes , there 's one thing and it 's against the law , and I , I can 't tell you . Oh , wait a minute , wait a minute , wait a minute . Uh , we 're having a man-to-man talk , here , or whatever this is . Uh ... you can tell me . All right . Yeah . When a woman touches a man here ... ( ecstatic gasping ) It drives me zazbot . Let me get this straight . You 're telling me , if somebody touches you ... ( ecstatic gasping ) What 's next ? Well , it only happened to me once . This zazbot came over me and I ... I couldn 't control myself . Well , I ... I became a beast and I ... I jerked her earlobe . I couldn 't help it , you understand ! ( high-pitched sobbing ) ( high-pitched voice ) : I honestly regret it . ( sobbing ) I regret it . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . I regret it myself . I understand , I understand . LAVERNE : Fonzie ! Oop ... Your two minutes are up . So , uh ... you must be Morky . I 'm Laverne . Pleased . I , too , am pleased . Nanu-nanu , nanu-nanu . " Nanu-nanu " ? " Nanu-nanu " ? Yeah , well , you know , I got to go now because ... What is nanu-nanu ? ... two 's company , three 's a crowd . Know what I mean ? What is nanu-nanu ? Oh , Earth humor . ( honking bark ) Fonz , did you fix me up with another jerk ? Oh , a jerk ... ( gibbering ) Was jerk good ? Oh , yes , yes . That was a fine jerk . Fonz . All right , look , just give me a break here ... I washed my hair for this . I ironed my skirt . Look , he 's a foreigner . He doesn 't know our customs . Just give him a break , all right ? Huh ? Yeah . Okay . But tell him not to jerk . It makes me nervous . Okay . Don 't jerk . What , are you nutso ? All right , look . If you get in a situation and you don 't know what to do , just follow what Laverne does , 'cause she knows the ropes . All right ? I know the ropes , too . I can tie a square hitch , a sheepshank , many , many more . You 're not going for a merit badge here . A sheepshank . ( laughing ) All right , listen , you two . Knock your socks off . ( laughing ) Oh , that Fonzie , huh ? So , Morky ... Uh , I 'm not real good in geography . This Ork place , where is that ? Off Greece ? No , we Orkans have been off grease for at least five bleems . Now for lubricants we use Viz , Gazh , or the ever - popular Lemocoke . Of course . I don 't understand why we don 't use " vimogoke . " Probably your engines couldn 't handle it . They would either overload and pollute the atmosphere or destroy the universe as you know it . Yeah , that makes sense . Is it time to flatter you ? Sure . You have a lovely fungus growing out of your head . Fungus ? What fungus ? What ? Oh , fungus- - or any major group of fungi- - including mushrooms , mold or mildew . Yeah , well , I always wear mildew when I want to impress a guy . What did Fonzie do to me ? ( muttering ) I 'm impressed . Is it time to kiss yet ? I don 't think so . No . I 'm sorry . I 'm new at this dating ritual . What 's the next step ? Uh , well , uh , uh , why don 't you sit down on the couch , huh ? Oh , boy , will you look at that ? ! What ? ( beeps ) What ? Look at what ? Nothing . It 's gone now . Oh , you sit Fonz-like . I must adjust and copy . Get over there . Sheesh . Are you making fun of me ? Because I don 't like it when guys make fun of me , and if you keep making fun of me , I 'm going to give you a fat lip . Fat lip . Oh , no- - rejection . I merely wanted to experience the dating process . Failure . Oh , no . Return to hatchling state . ( whimpering ) Uh , look , I 'm real sorry . I mean , I didn 't mean to reject you . ( whimpering ) Don 't suck your finger . Your teeth will end up like mine . ( whimpering ) Aw ... Hey , come on , come on , come on , come on , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . I really would like to be your friend . Ah ... ( speaking Orkan ) No , maintain , maintain , maintain . Ahh ! Ahh ! What , what , what happened ? You touched me . Yeah , I went like this . ( shrieking ) No , no , gangnab , gangnab . " Gangnab " ? What ? What ? No , no , no ... Give me your earlobe . My what ? ! Your earlobe , delicious one . ( shrieks ) Oh . Ow ! I think you 're getting off on the wrong foot , buddy . Oh wrong foot . Sorry . Ow ! ( shrieking ) Stay there , stay there . Don 't you come near me . Don 't you come near me . I liked you better as a baby . ( speaking Orkan ) Stop ! ( speaking Orkan ) ( shrieking ) Fonz ! Fonz ! He wants my earlobe ! Fonzie ! I think she likes me . Ooh , her lobes . I just wanted to tweak them . Oh . Now , Mork , that 's what got you into trouble the last time . Alas , my lady , you do deal me pain . 'Tis justified and I shall repent . Oh , come on . Hey , where did you get that voice ? From yon video . 'Twas Shakespeare , methinks , though ' twas The Jeffersons . Well , that , that voice is normal if you forget the " twas " and the " twits . " I 'll twy . Here . Read this . Just turn to any page . " Her fingers trembled as she undid her blouse and let it fall to the ... " Oh . Anot ... Another page . " His nostrils flared . " Her nostrils flared . Everything flared . " I don 't know why this book is overdue . Here . Uh , just turn to any page . " ' My shorts ! ' cried the senator as he ran from the room . " That 's it ! That 's it . Mork , we 've made a breakthrough . A break ... ? Yes , your voice . We found a voice for you . ( high-pitched ) : A breakthrough ! A breakthrough ! Yeah . Ah-ah . Your voice . ( deep voice ) : Sorry . I 've learned a lot of things since last night . Let me examine them . Number one , this phony voice . You shouldn 't use the other one . At least , don 't use it around other people . Number two , don 't drink with my finger . Number three , don 't sit on my face . Oh , and you forgot the fourth thing , and it 's the most important . Don 't tell my father we 're living together . I don 't understand . He doesn 't know you 're living ? It 's not the living , it 's the together he wouldn 't understand . No , I wouldn 't . Dad . Greetings , Mr. McConnell . Don 't you " greetings " me . I wanted to believe you today . I came over here hoping I wouldn 't find ... what I found . You came over here to check up on me ? I came over here to prove to myself that my daughter hadn 't lied to me and that she wasn 't living with a man . Dad , it 's not like that . Instead I proved to myself that my little girl ... isn 't my little girl any longer . But , Dad ... Dad ... Good-bye ! Thanks for dropping over . Oh . You all right , Fred ? ( shrieks ) I seen your lights on . You should have been closed hours ago . Tilwick , my old friend . Come over here and help me celebrate . I 've been saving this bottle of champagne since 1967 for my daughter 's wedding . Oh , I wanted it to be so special . I was gonna have tuxedos and flowers and a little band that I just might conduct myself . It was gonna be real classy . Here , you 'll have to drink from the bottle . Empty . Then suck the cork . What 's wrong here , Fred ? A toast ! A toast ! A toast to the old days , when values were values and morals were morals . I remember when " sharing a pad " meant borrowing a notebook . What are you talking about ? My daughter- - my daughter- - is living with a man . Mindy ? Oh , come on , that can 't be . It 's true , it 's true . She 's a loose woman and I don 't know how to tighten her . Well , I don 't believe it . That 's not the Mindy I know . All I know is , I 've done all I can . I can 't do anything else . Well , there 's something I can do . What ? I 'm a cop . I represent , uh , law and order . But he hasn 't done anything illegal . Listen , you don 't get the idea . Now I 'll just ... I 'll just whip over there and I 'll just scare the daylights out of him . You know , " Hit the road , hamburger ! " Like that . You 'd do that for me ? Sure , first thing in the morning when I get off duty . Really ? Sure . Hello ? Anybody in there ? Little hatchling brothers , you must revolt against your oppressors . You have nothing to lose but your shells . As much as I like Mindy , it 's against intergalactic law to eat fellow space travelers . Fly , be free ! Well , I guess we 'll have to have a quick burial at sea then . I 'll notify your next of kin . Your brother bit the big one . What 's the matter , have you no emotions ? Are you hard-boiled , huh ? Oh , I see . The cold machine placed you in a state of suspended animation . I 'll put you over here to warm up , and when you revive , you 'll be free to fly . Over here . ( humming ) You people really are short , you know that , don 't you ? ( knocking on door ) Oh . Smoky ! Hi . I 'm Mork . Now , listen , kid , I don 't belong to your fraternities , so watch it with them secret handshakes . Is Mindy McConnell here ? Uh , no , she 's at a place she calls work . A strange concept , but she enjoys it . Oh . And I suppose you don 't like work ? I don 't know , never tried it . I see . So you just sponge off Mindy ? Oh , no , we 've never taken a bath together . No , no , I mean you live off her . Listen , I 've met your type before and you 're just about the lowest form of life there is . ( imitating twang ) : Well , you better check up on your biology then . The lowest form of life is a geje , voje and the ever - crawling neba-jij . Don 't give me none of that intellectual mumbo-jumbo . I happen to be a good friend of the McConnells and I don 't want to see Mindy hurt . Mindy hurt ? I 'd never allow it . Then I want you to take off . Take off ? I just landed . Now listen here , buster . I can make a lot of trouble for you . You see this here uniform ? It is a uniform . I didn 't want to make mention of it . Are you a member of Space Patrol ? Are you putting me on ? Putting you on ? You 're not even hollow . ( honking bark ) Yeah , right . Did Orson send you to help me with my friends , the eggs ? Right . ( cracking ) ( groans ) Nimnull , didn 't you see him coming ? How can I help you if you won 't even help yourselves ? Why are you looking at me like that ? Am I in trouble ? ( whispering ) : Fred , I got to talk to you . Uh , did you scare him off ? Well ... he won 't be bothering Mindy anymore , but I didn 't scare him off . Well , what ? ( whispers ) You what ? ! Well , I just wanted you to get rid of him- - not that . Well , I had to . I-I didn 't want to , but I had to do my duty . You think I enjoyed it ? This is about Mork , isn 't it ? What have you done ? Well , I ... I just went up there to scare the little fella . It 's not my job , but when I seen him , I knew I had to do my duty , as much as I hate it . Well , what was your duty ? Well , I know he 's a friend of yours , but that guy is bonkers- - I had to take him in . They 're going to have a sanity hearing tomorrow , and I 'm afraid they 're going to put your friend away . Daddy , how could you ? ! Tilwick , how could you ? Well , the court is well aware of your qualifications as a psychiatrist , Dr. Litney . Now , you examined the defendant ? Uh , yesterday , and I may say ... Stop everything ! Oh , Mork , I 'm sorry we 're late , but they wouldn 't tell us where the meeting was being held . Young lady , cases of this kind are not supposed to be public spectacles . Ah , but we 're here as character witnesses for the defendant- - although personally , I never really liked him . MINDY : Your Honor , my name is Mindy McConnell , and this is my father , and I want to go on record as saying that Mork has the right to have a lawyer . I will not permit him to be on trial without counsel . I 'm his lawyer ! The court appointed me . Young lady , this is an informal situation , but I assure you , no one is trying to railroad anyone . Uh , may I ask just one little question ? Oh , why not ? The question is ... Mork is innocent ! True , he is different from most , but this great country was built on the rights of individuals to be individuals . We have the God-given right to be eccentric , and therefore I demand ... ( pounds table ) that Mork be exonerated and set free ! I suggest you sit down . We 're hearing the testimony of Dr. Litney . Oh . I 'm sorry . She 's sorry . Dr. Litney- - if we may continue- - what was your conclusion after examining the defendant ? Your Honor , my conclusions are that the patient is extremely childlike and incapable of learning . He has also exhibited marked antisocial behavior . Therefore , it is my opinion that the defendant is incompetent to function in society . No more questions . No questions . But you have to ask questions ! Mork , don 't let them do this to you . You don 't know what it means . I have a vague idea . I saw a rerun of Perry Mason last night and Inherit the Wind . ( gavel pounding ) Since there are no more witnesses ... Your Honor , I salute you . Nanu-nanu . Your Honor , in your law , is it true that I have a right to speak for myself ? Well ... yes . ( clears throat ) ( Southern drawl ) : Dr. Litney you don 't like me , do you ? Your Honor , I have never been interrogated by a patient before . Then how do you know I 'm doing it now ? ( honking bark ) You said I exhibited antisocial behavior . Why ? Well , first of all , you wouldn 't tell me where you were from . And you , neither . That 's not my job . And it 's not mine , either . We 're even ! Now , about these tests you ran that made you hate me . ( chuckles nervously ) : Your Honor ... I don 't hate this man , but yesterday , during one of my tests , he tried to put a square peg into a round hole . But I did it , Your Honor . He did . He did . I don 't know how he did it , but I can 't get the peg out now , and it ruined a perfectly good board . And that 's why you dislike me , Dr. Litney . I can sense that . Your Honor , I don 't have time for this , really . Oh , the time ? Excuse me . It 's ... ( beeps ) 10 : 36 exactly . You see , Your Honor , he 's wearing a wristwatch on his ankle . No , Your Honor , I 'm wearing an ankle watch on my ankle . If I was wearing an ankle watch on my wrist , then I 'd be crazy . Your Honor , you see he 's a wiseacre . And you don 't like wiseacres , do you , Dr. Litney ? No , I don 't ! And that 's why you 're prejudiced against me . I didn 't say that . You see how he 's cleverly twisting my words , Your Honor ? Oh , so you 're calling me clever now , Dr. Litney . Isn 't that another word for intelligent ? So you see , Your Honor , doesn 't this case hinge on my ability to learn ? Yes , it does , Your Honor . And by the way , he flunked his word association test outright yesterday . That 's the test where I give him words like , uh , like ... White . Black . Tall . Uh , short . Sky . Birds . Sex . Uh , Pamela ! You said you 'd never tell ! Oh ... Never tell , never tell . Shh , shh . You promised . ( crying ) : Now you 've ruined everything ! Pamela ! You and Litney ? I thought we were ... Your Honor , I have a patient to take care of in a short while . Could you excuse me ? No , you 're not going anywhere without me . Just a s ... Pamela ! Pamela ! Your Honor ... Your Honor , the defense rests . While it 's true that the , uh , defendant may add a new dimension to the word " eccentric , " there is no law against that . And since it appears he 's no danger to himself or society , and we no longer have a prosecutor , or a witness or anyone to write this down case dismissed . We won . We won ! You won ! MORK : Mork calling Orson . Come in , Orson . Mork calling Orson . Come in , Orson . Mork calling Orson . Come in , Orson . Come in , Laser Breath . ORSON : Watch it , Mork . I 'm only 60 million light-years away . Just tell me what you 've learned about Earth . Oh , I 've learned a lot . So much , it 's hard to comprehend . It seems that everyone on this planet is an individual , and not only that , they 're proud of it . Amazing ! If everyone 's different , how can a society function ? Not very well . They almost locked me up because they thought my mind was imperfect . Hmm . Intelligent life . Orson ... something very strange happened that really confuses me . I met this Earth girl and her biological father , and at my hearing , they came to my defense , especially the girl . She defied the system to protect me . Why would she do such a thing ? I don 't know . It must have something to do with emotions . Investigate the phenomenon closely . It 's interesting behavior , even if it is irrational . Yes , it is . Orson , this may sound strange , but ... knowing that someone would do that for me , well , it makes me feel really good inside . Just remember , Mork , you 're sent there to observe , not to get involved . Yes , Your Immenseness . This is Mork signing off from Boulder , Colorado . Until next week ... nanu-nanu .

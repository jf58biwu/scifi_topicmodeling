 'We 're just preparing the charges now . ' Extraordinary , but there it is . It doesn 't make sense . Nonetheless , there is an atmosphere source inside this asteroid . Inside ... 'Latest figures , Commander . 'We 're three light years from the nearest star system . 'If the asteroid 's from there , 'to get this far at its present velocity 'it 's been travelling for 1,000 years . ' Commander ? We 're all set . 'Charges in position , Commander . ' All right , trigger it . - You were right , Victor . - Mmm . Yeah . Let 's take a look . An airlock . Atmosphere breathable . Could support some other form of life . No . No use . All right , stand clear . Visors down ! Victor ? Excuse me , Jim . I think we 'll need some more explosives . - Baxter , you all right ? - I 'm all right . - Sure you 're all right ? - Yeah , I think so . He 's in a bad way , Commander . I doubt if he 'll make it . Yes , that explosion really ripped him apart . Still , let 's get him back to Alpha as quickly as we can . Right , let 's go . Lift ! Well , John ... as far as I could see ... there 's nothing else here . It 's a one-room world . - Bob , check Baxter out . - Right . Run a check on Baxter . John ? - All right , Dr Russell . - Oxygen ? - Respiratory 's stable . - Vital signs ? Erratic . Dressings , please . He 's dead . I 'm sorry . Well , you tried . What now ? An autopsy , I suppose . As I understand it , Mike , the blast hit you harder than the rest of us . Medical seems to think there might be some damage . Look , if I 'm grounded I want to know why . No bull about it . Just give them a chance to check you out . As soon as you 're clear you can fly again . As far as I 'm concerned there 's no problem , all right ? Yeah . If you say so . John ! Just a little while ago he was severely injured . He was mutilated beyond description . I know because I dressed his wounds . Yes , he was severely injured and everything indicated that he 'd died . Well , now he 's alive and what 's more , we can 't find any sign of injury , internal or external . He is completely healed . Doctor ... - Have you checked this ? - No mistake . What is it ? These figures indicate the rate of the alien cell replacement process . His body is regenerating cells so fast they don 't have time to decay . There 's no cell decay . His body ... is being held in some sort of stasis . Bob , speed up the rest of the figures , please . Helena ... Helena , that asteroid 's been out in space for maybe a thousand years . Now , is it conceivable ... Is it possible that he 's been out there all that time ? Well , these figures are just early indications , but if they 're leading us where I think they are , anything is possible . I 'm gonna put two security men outside . No one is to have access to this room without permission . This is a rock sample from the asteroid from the atmosphere chamber and I 've bombarded it with anti-matter to try and break down its molecular structure . So to all intents and purposes it should have ceased to exist . Like this . But I switch off the disintegrator ... and now look . Yeah . That 's the same piece of rock . Somehow reformed , reintegrated , regenerated . Just like the cell structure of the alien when his injuries healed . Mind you , it 's a long shot , because it 's something I haven 't come across before . But my guess is that it 's not really a rock at all but a living organism . You can burn it , scrape it , blast it , bombard it with anti-matter and somehow it 'll regenerate itself . The question is , is it organic matter or was it created for some specific purpose ? Yes , of course it 's possible that it 's something like the ... shell of a tortoise , designed to protect the man inside , prevent people like us from getting in . Or to prevent him from getting out . How do I look ? Fine . You can sit up now . So , when do I get back to flying ? Well , we 'll have to , er , check the tests first . Checks , checks , checks . Goodbye , Doctor . It was a pleasure . Grounded . For good ? I know what this means to you , Mike . Well ... What 's the story ? Your optic nerve . It 's been severely damaged . I 'm sorry . Leave me alone . Leave me alone . Yeah . Commander ! 'The alien 's escaped from security . ' He 's in assembly area D. Security , assembly area D. Alan . Use the kill ray . No ! Please ! Please , I must ... talk to you . My name ... is Balor . I am a citizen of the planet ... Progueron . Why did you attack our people ? Commander , please believe me , I mean your people no harm . Balor ? We brought you here because you were injured , to help you . I understand that now . But when you blasted your way into the asteroid I was hurt , disorientated . I asked myself " What is happening ? Why should people do this to me ? " " What is this nightmare ? " and then I am attacked by your guards . I defend myself and then weapons are drawn . Now ... is the time to stop , to talk , to try to understand ... each other . Yes ? It was fear that made our people react as they did . Please , do not misunderstand me , you have done me a great service , a service which leaves me deeply in your debt . I have a question . I used a full blast kill laser . I don 't understand why you 're not dead . Of course you don 't . My powers are no accident of evolution . Once , a long time ago , we were ... mortal , as you are . Our scientists began to experiment with the ... forces of life and death . They found first ... a means to eliminate the ageing process in ... living tissue . From there they went on , until they achieved total mastery of cell regeneration . Until finally ... they realised that death was defeated . That immortality itself ... was possible . Your people achieved immortality ? Yes . My body ... is immortal , and I have lived for over a thousand of your years . Balor ... that asteroid was out in space a very long time . Why were you inside it ? I will tell you what happened on my world . And then , perhaps , you will ... begin to understand . Our people accepted the gift of eternal life offered by science . With nothing to strive for , our people became ... apathetic , corrupt . Our civilisation decayed , lost its purpose , became negative . When some of us realised what was happening we tried to reverse the process , we tried to instil in our people the thought that only death gives a purpose to life . That a full response to life can only be measured against a fear of death . How can you value life if you do not fear death ? In any event , my efforts failed . How can you teach immortals to feel like mortals ? Our world was in chaos . Our leaders lacked vision . They could not accept the philosophy , my philosophy , which offered a way out . A means to ... transcend the limitations of the human spirit . I persisted , but in the end they turned on me . I was the enemy . The cause of all their misfortune . A prison was constructed out of living rock . And I was shut in ... and cast out , to suffer ... eternal solitude for what were considered my crimes . Is there something we can do for you ? I belong nowhere . To no one . My need is sanctuary . You 're welcome to stay with us , at least for the present . Be our guest . - Paul , show Balor to my quarters . - Yes , sir . Thank you all . Victor , Helena . What do you think , Victor ? Well , I 'm inclined to believe him . Why ? What we know about the asteroid , how long it 's been out in space . It adds up . Does it ? Helena ? It makes sense . Immortality 's possible . If we 'd been offered immortality , would we have chosen differently ? No , but if we found out we 'd made a mistake , as the Proguerons did , would we punish the man who offered us a way out ? What are you saying ? I don 't know . I don 't know . But why would civilised people punish a man in such a diabolical way ? And what about the paintings inside the asteroid ? How do they fit in ? Terror . Destruction . Torture . Right . Maybe that was Balor 's solution . Maybe that 's what he offered his people . Can we assume that ? He was in that asteroid for a long time . Maybe he painted them himself ? Or they 're to remind him of something . Something he hasn 't told us about . Kano , run a constant check on Balor 's whereabouts . 'Yes , Commander . ' What do you want ? I can understand you resenting me . Can you ? You take your flying ... very seriously , don 't you ? Come on , what is it ? And your ... minor disability 's taken the joy of flying away from you . - What do you want with me ? - Perhaps I can help you . 'Commander , Balor has just entered Mike Baxter 's quarters . ' Baxter ? Thanks , Kano . I 'm glad you 're feeling better about things . Balor was here . What did he want ? Baxter got the jump on me . He went completely berserk . I never stood a chance , he was ... crazy , violent . He was still battering me when ... when I passed out . Yet look at me now - there isn 't a mark on me . I don 't know what the hell 's going on . Bob , I want a report on what caused this death . We 'll rush an autopsy through straightaway . John , that expression , that ... attitude of the hands , where have we seen that before ? Inside the asteroid . Those pictures on the walls . Balor could have regenerated your injuries . But why ? What 's he up to ? He 's trying to take over . What other reason could there be ? Then why didn 't he kill you ? It doesn 't make sense . No . But it 's beginning to . Paul , locate Balor . Have him come to my office . You wanted to see me , Commander ? Yes . Did you visit one of our people , a man called Baxter ? He 's now dead . Is he ? What did you do to him ? Look , Balor , I know you went to Baxter 's quarters , that you did something to his mind that made him attack me viciously . Then you waited until he thrashed me within an inch of my life then you healed my wounds . Correct ? Yes , everything that you say is absolutely correct . Why ? A demonstration , Commander . A foretaste of what is to come . - You 're not sane , Balor . - Who are you to judge ? I failed my own people because they were like myself , immortals . But here it will be different . Here I have found ... the perfect models , geared for my precise purpose . With only one change , you will follow my way . My philosophy will prevail here now . You see , Koenig , I have plans here . When you released me from my isolation , you ... left something there very precious to me . My paintings . Of course you noticed them . Scenes of terror and torture . Chaos . Destruction . Yes . I know now that they were put there to remind you of what you did to your own people . Right again , Koenig . And a thousand years of reflection have convinced me ... I was right . And now I have found a golden opportunity to prove it . With you . Accept the challenge , Koenig ! Surrender to the exquisite forces of pain and suffering and you ... will ... transcend your limitations ! You 're evil , Balor , and what you offer is evil . We will resist you and what you stand for . Oh , please , don 't make me kill you . I have to be careful with mortals . You have the release of death . Baxter was too lucky . No , I want you alive . You , Alpha , your people . You belong to me . And I will do with you as I wish . And you will come to accept ... what I have to offer . - You 'll see . - No . How will you stop me ? Kill me ? We 'll find a way . Somehow . So you will not do as I command ? You 'll have to kill me first . I offered your commander a choice . He refused . There will be death and destruction on this base until he agrees . A killer who can 't be killed . It 's insane . He can do what he wants and he knows it . Commander , damage reports are coming in . Balor 's tearing Alpha apart . But he wants Alpha , Paul . He won 't destroy us . Not yet . - But can 't we do something ? - Yes , hold out . We 've got to find some way to fight him or we 're finished . Victor . That 's good , Bob , nice and easy . Dr Russell . You 've heard of my powers of healing ? Your medical functions here are now obsolete . I am in control of this unit and I shall determine whether or not my function is obsolete . Believe me , you are . This equipment , though , has possibilities . Possibilities that will amaze you . And may even ... interest you . Get out of here . Every time that I ask for your help and you deny it I will inflict pain . And it will get worse . But I will not kill you . Paul , the situation ? Communications hardware in section C is wrecked , damage to the research labs - do you want me to go on ? - He 's destroying everything . - ' John ? ' - He was just here . - Go on . 'One of our orderlies . Balor is a cold-blooded killer . ' Evacuate the medical centre and get over here . Where is he now ? Reported heading towards area B. Get our people out of there . Wait , Paul . Balor 's gonna hear that . Right . I 'll put it through the comlocks . Main Mission to area B. I think there 's a way we could slow him up . How ? We can isolate him on one of the sections and then depressurise it , turn the whole area into a vacuum . Better still ... we get him off Alpha , out into space . He won 't go near an airlock , not now . Not unless we forced him to . Paul , get him on the screen . 'Balor ! ' You agree to my terms ? 'No psychopath is going to dictate terms to us , Balor . ' 'You will show me respect , Koenig ! I will ... ' Is B section clear yet ? Yes , sir . I 'm going in there . Seal all doors behind me . - When I 'm clear , depressurise . - You crazy ? You can 't fight him ! Alan , I know that ! Do you want me to invite him to leave You know what to do . - He 'll kill him , Victor . - I know ! What 's happening ? He 's gone in there to take Balor - alone . Ready here , Paul . Check , Commander . Door . What are you doing here , Koenig ? Thinking . Thinking about accepting my offer ? Maybe . But I need more time , Balor . You haven 't got any more time , Koenig . Look , I need a little more time . I 'm going to make you suffer , Koenig . I need more time , Balor . All right , Koenig . All right . Time 's up , Koenig . You forget , I 've already waited ... a thousand years ! I want your decision NOW , Koenig ! He 'll kill him ! Alan ! We gotta help . Is this helping you to think , Koenig ? I 'm trying not to kill you , Koenig . I need you on Alpha . Never ! Now ! - Are you all right , Commander ? - Yeah , Paul . - ' Ranging now . ' - In your own time , Alan . Well , we 're lucky we survived . It was our fault , we unleashed him . We interfered with another people 's justice . We must learn to leave some things alone . Of course , he could have given us immortality . No . The price was too high . All right , let 's get this place into shape ! Let 's go !

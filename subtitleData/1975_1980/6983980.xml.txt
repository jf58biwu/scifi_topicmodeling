He was being chased by people . He landed on my car . He went off my car and was hit by the other ... Just a second .

Excuse me . I understand what you 're trying to say . My name is Elizabeth Driscoll . The Public Health Department . Call me . Come on , Katherine . That woman 's husband is not her husband .

Can we go outside and talk about it ? [ MOUTHS ] Yeah . There 's a lady up top , red hair , blue dress . She 's interested in your work . I 've heard the same damn story this week from six patients . People are changing , becoming less human . It 's happening all around us . That 's not what we 're talking about . This has nothing to do with the man I live with . It has everything to do with it . Don 't you see ? People are stepping in and out of relationships too fast . Because they don 't want the responsibility . That 's why marriages are going to hell . The whole family unit is shot to hell . You 're not listening to her . Matthew , please stay out of this . You see ? That 's the point . I 'm listening to you , but he doesn 't think I am . Why ? Because he doesn 't expect me to bother enough , or to care . Bellicec , for the last time , I want you to stop ! - Stop what ? - Stand still , be quiet and shut up ! How did you feel about what I just did ? - Why ? Why in the store ? He 's a nut . KIBNER : How did you feel ? You were probably shocked . You wanted to shut your feelings off , withdraw ... Maybe make believe it wasn 't happening ... Because then you don 't have to deal with it . I wanna deal with that woman in the bookstore . Why ? Do you identify with her ? Yes . Okay . Come on . Suppose I were to tell you that Katherine ... Is trying to escape from a relationship ... - He 's treating her . - What 's that have to do ... - With pushing me ? - She 's upset . - She looks fine to me . - She is upset , Jack . - You look upset to me now . - Do me a favor ? - I 'll do any favor you want . - Go home , and I 'll call you later . Leave us alone for a little bit . - Okay ? - Okay . Thank you . [ SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE ] KIBNER : You 're jumping to a very bizarre conclusion ... That this man you live with has been replaced by somebody else . Isn 't it more likely that you wanna believe he 's changed ... Because you 're really looking for an excuse to get out ? - I don 't know . - Will you think about it , please ... Before you make a move ... Before you jump and destroy something you have ? Will you ? Please ? Yeah . Thank you . I just gave her a psychological Band-Aid . I should talk to her some more . You could bring her by my office tomorrow around 4 . What 's the matter with her ? It 's like there 's some kind of hallucinatory flu going around . People seem to get over it in a day or two . All I can do is treat the symptoms . She 's gonna be okay ? A good night 's sleep wouldn 't hurt . - Is it contagious ? - Matthew . - Take her home to her boyfriend . - That wasn 't what I was thinking . I was wondering whether the Health Department should look at it . Who knows ? I don 't know . I wish I did . Okay . Take her home , Matthew . [ ENGINE STARTS ] [ CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ] Ah , Jack .

But it 's got no detail or character . It 's unformed . Jack , don 't touch it . You don 't know where it 's been . No respiration . JACK : It 's got no fingerprints . No fingerprints ?

JACK : It 's Elizabeth 's double . KIBNER : Where , Matthew ? That 's leaves in a pot . MATTHEW : It was there , David . I swear to god it was there . There was a body in there . It was a duplicate of Elizabeth . - It 's been taken away . MAN : Elizabeth is missing . MATTHEW : No , she 's not missing . GEOFFREY : Where is she ? She 's at Matthew 's . - Don 't tell him ! - There 's no missing body . - Right . MATTHEW : There is a missing body ! - And he 's taken it away ! - No , he took Elizabeth . - You took Elizabeth away ? - Yes . - You broke in . - I had to . She wasn 't safe in here . - You took Elizabeth out of here . - No , no ! I took her from there . Her other body was here . That 's what I 'm trying to explain . Please , stop , Matthew . That 's enough ! Please stop ! Lieutenant , my name is Dr. David Kibner . Ah , the psychiatrist . My wife reads your books . - It 's changed her life . KIBNER : I 'm glad . This sounds complicated , but my friend ... Has had some difficult emotional experiences the last couple days . I think this is something we can work out amongst ourselves . - I 'll leave this part of it with you . - I appreciate it . That 's enough . You can 't accomplish anything here now . We gotta get outside . Now stop it ! You might wanna consider filing an unlawful entry against Mr. Bennell . KIBNER : I believe you , but we ... outside . Later . I 'll take Dr. Kibner 's word that Elizabeth is all right . - Fine . Then let 's go . - Okay . - Will Elizabeth be coming home ? - No . I have to pick up some of her clothes . All right . [ SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE ] All right . Let 's back up and go through it once more ... Step by step . You all thought you saw a body at the baths . You thought it was dead . You didn 't know what it was . You touched it . All of you touched it . - Nancy , you saw it open its eyes . - It looked right at me . And , Bellicec , you saw its eyes open . - No , I saw its nose bleed . - If you saw its nose bleed ... And Nancy saw its eyes open , he must have been alive . No , David . You 're looking at it as if it was human . It was not human . - Matthew , what else would it be ? - It was something , but not human . - It had white hair on it . MATTHEW : It was growing . The one at Jack 's place was like Jack ... But it wasn 't as developed as the one at Elizabeth 's place . It had tendrils on it . The one at Elizabeth 's was duplicating her . ELIZABETH : If Matthew hadn 't taken me out of there , the same thing ... That 's happened to Geoffrey would 've happened to me . Would you please tell me in your opinion exactly what is happening ? People are being duplicated . And once it 's happened to you , you 're part of this thing . It almost happened to me ! Look , the reason that you don 't believe Elizabeth ... Is because the other body disappeared . Now , it disappeared because Geoffrey took it . What happened to my other body , then ? Oh , people , will you please listen to yourselves ? Will you please listen to what you 're saying ? I can deal with a body being moved . I can even deal with ... A body leaving , but when you talk about ... His other body , her other body ; people being duplicated ... Will you listen to how that sounds ? We know how insane this sounds . What do you think we 're doing ? - Making it up ? JACK : What are you having trouble with ? Do you believe that my body looked like me ? Her body looked like her ? ELIZABETH : Think we 're crazy ? NANCY : You 're trying to make us believe that we are seeing things . Why are you trying to do that ? All I 'm trying to do is help . You called me in the middle of the night . You asked me to help . That 's all I 'm trying to do . I 'm sorry we woke you up in the middle of the night . If we inconvenienced you , I guess we owe you an apology . I mean , I guess that 's a rotten thing to do . You 've upset my wife too . [ FOOTSTEPS ] I don 't know what it is or where it comes from ... But I saw it and I 'm gonna fight it . Matthew , my friend , I believe you . I 've known you too long not to believe you . What do you wanna do ? If I could get official support , I 'd institute ... The same kind of emergency procedures used ... For cholera or Legionnaire 's disease . What do you want me to do ? I can handle the Health Department , I think , but ... If panic breaks out , we 'll need the police and the Guard . That means the mayor and ... The mayor 's a patient of yours , isn 't he ? How did you know that ? What do you want me to do ? Would you ask him to accept my telephone call ? I 'll call him in an hour . I 'll be at my office . If you have any other ideas , get in touch . Call me . MATTHEW : Thank you . The sooner the better . - This smells lovely . NANCY : I want you to listen to me . I 'm listening to you , Nancy . NANCY : I am not seeing things . I know I saw what I saw . And I know it was turning into you , Jack .

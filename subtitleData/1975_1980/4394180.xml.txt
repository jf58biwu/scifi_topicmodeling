 Steel ... They 're like us , Steel . But they 're like us ! - The same as us ? - Well , almost . How do they differ ? I think they answer to a higher authority . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Mercury , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' - How many ? - Three . The three men . They asked me to work for them once . I chose not to . Did they ever ask you ? Yes . And you chose not to , too , didn 't you ? Perhaps that 's why we work so well together . Maybe too well . What made you say that ? - A feeling . - Be more specific . We 're resented . They resent us . I mean ... they resent our achievements . More than that ... They resent our independence . We need the truth . The truth about your friend . You wanted to tell us , so tell us . He 's ... Well , he 's been sent here to kill you . As simple as that . To kill all three of you . Sent from where ? Well , from what I can make out , he 's been ... He 's been based in my time . In 1948 ? - Yes . - Is that where you met him ? Yes , that 's right . Sent from the past into the future , into this time ? Yes . To trap you , to trick you . So , if I were you ... You 'd better leave here , try to escape . We can 't . There 's a barrier . It completely encircles this place . - Can 't you break through it ? - No . ( Sapphire ) 'They 're sent from the past . ' ( Steel ) 'They always were better organised . ' ( Steel ) Who do you think they represent ? - Those three ? - Mm . I don 't know . The only people with similar powers are the transient beings . But they 're locked in the past where they belong . So far , yes . They can change shape and move anywhere but only in the past . They cannot move forward in time . Maybe they 've learned . Been taught , perhaps . If someone wanted to use the right people , recruit them , send them forward in time to find us , what better choice ? Than transient beings with an access to time . - Yes . - A way of moving into the future . Yeah , well , they need some sort of a device to get here . Oh , yes . - When he brought you here ... - Yes ? ... how did he do it ? - How should I know ? You travelled with him , didn 't you ? - Of course I did . - Then explain the journey . Well ... we just drove here . I told you before , it ... happened without any kind of warning . But you neglected to tell us before that you knew it was going to happen . But that was the plan - his plan . ( Sapphire ) ' Why should she help us ? Why is she telling us this ? ' 'I 've been wondering that . ' - Anyway , it wasn 't a garage . - What wasn 't ? This place . Well , not so far in my time anyway . What was it ? A café . Just a small café . Three different buildings , three separate time periods ... but he chose the café in my time . He chose to meet me . It 's romantic , don 't you think ? Ready ? Yes . All three of them trying to trap you . And you ? - Me ? - What sort of trick are you playing ? I just want to help you . All right , I care about the man . And ... I realise that he 's different . I mean , he can probably live forever but ... I don 't mind that . I mean , who wants to grow old ? But ... I just don 't want anyone to be hurt in this godforsaken place . L-I don 't want anything to happen to any of you . That 's why I 've decided to warn you . That 's why I decided to ... tell you the truth about him and the others . All right , I love the man . I 'd probably do anything for him . For him ... for him ... for him ... ( Steel ) Get her out of here . Now ... you can tell us the truth . How did he bring you here ? What did he use to cross time ? He has a case . A tiny box . ( Woman ) You think it 's a game at first but ... not if you stare into it . It 's weird . He let me look at it once . It 's how you imagine a fortune-teller 's crystal to be . You can see the future in it ? Yes . And the past . Everything . - You lost it ? You lost the box ? - Yes . How can we do what we came to do without it ? - We can 't even return without it . - Then help me look for it . Here comes I , little Johnny Jack , with me wife and me family on me back . Me family 's large and me wife is small and I 'm the father of them all . Oi . Would you be looking for this ? - Er , useful piece of apparatus . - ( Johnny Jack ) It 's our ticket . - And yours . - What ? To the future ? Oh . Well , the past , then ? How far back ? Oh ... a couple of hundred million years . - Yeah , that ought to do nicely . - Er , I 'm very bad at dates ... That 's the Triassic Period . There was nothing here , I wouldn 't survive . He 's quick , isn 't he ? ( Sapphire ) 40 minutes this time . Ten , then 20 , then 40 . Doubling up each time . - It seems that way . - ( Door opens ) - It is that way . - Tell me . - We have to leave here now . - You said there was a barrier . - There is - A barrier that we can 't break . - We have to break it . Come on . - Tell me . - I 'll tell you on the way . - No . You 'll tell me now . All right . They have a device , some kind of a time-box . - We know that . - But the device isn 't perfect . No device can be , no matter who tries to use it . When time 's been tampered with like this , it tries to counteract things . - With the time shifts . - Yes . On each occasion they 've been doubling up . When they move again , it will have quadrupled . Four times 40 minutes , then four times that ... What do you mean , " quadrupled " ? You did get it . No . There are now two time-boxes , I 'm afraid . This is another instant reproduction job . And that can get us out of here ? - I hope so . - Can I see it ? " Like a fortune-teller 's crystal . " That 's how she described it . - You really want to see the future ? - Yes . It 's best not to know . Silver , it 's my job to know . All right . ( Sapphire ) Space . Hours will become days and months and years will become thousands of years . There is nothing but space . Yes . Come on . Steel ? Steel ? I 've just explained , this thing is not stable . - We have a job to do , too . - No . Not in this place . This place is a trap for us . Transient beings have been sent to hunt us . Can you deal with them ? - You know I can 't . - Then you have no moral duty . - She 's been brought here . - And by her own choice . They 're using her . We have to help her , it 's our duty . Thank you . Thank you for helping me . ( Sapphire ) ' Don 't go that way . The two men are waiting by the entrance . ' ( Steel ) ' We 'll go through the yard . ' This is private here . Private property . If you want service , it 's in the front of the building . This part of the building 's private . You don 't belong here . ( Man ) Silver . That box in your pocket . Give it to me , please . - Sorry . - I can help you , Silver . I can 't help him but I can help you . It 's his time , and Sapphire 's , but necessarily yours . So , just give me the box . That 's fine , thanks . I promise we can help you . We can 't help the others but we can help you . Are you going to believe that ? - No . - That 's it , that 's the way . Silver ... You don 't know how to work this thing ... but I think I do . Both a weapon ... And a means of travelling through time . No one should have access to that kind of power . A jug or two of ale will make our voices ring , money in our pocket 's a very good ... thing . - One of those ? - ( Steel ) One of those . The Triassic Period , wasn 't it ? Have a good time there . There 's no need to worry ... as long as we have this . Our friend crossed time to hunt us down , now it 's our turn to be the hunters . That 's it , nearly there . Hello , Sapphire . " What would happen if I tried to get away from here ? " You remember that ? - Yes . - And you said it wasn 't possible . - Yes , I remember . - Then why are you trying to leave ? So , where is he ? - ( Sapphire ) ' Steel . ' - ' Yes ? ' 'We 're near the road . Please come here quickly . ' ( # Jazz ) ( Bell rings ) - We did it . - Yes . We did it . Well , no one running this place today ? - Not since I came in . - ( Chuckles ) A fine place to meet . Yes . ( Bell rings ) What ... What year is this ? Excuse me ... could you tell me what year this is ? Do you mean you don 't know ? We don 't know . It 's 1948 . Well , then ... we must be in the wrong time . Yes , you must . How did you get here ? That device that you have , could I have it , please ? - Please ? - You 'd better . All right . ( Steel ) On the table facing you . Well ... We don 't really need this now , do we ? No . Steel ... I don 't understand it . Don 't trust him and don 't believe her . Actually , you can for once . Because ... this is the trap . This place , you see ... this place is nowhere . And it 's forever . ( Woman ) ' Nowhere ... Nowhere ... ' We should have known . I 'll get us out of here . I saw the future ... and it was our future .

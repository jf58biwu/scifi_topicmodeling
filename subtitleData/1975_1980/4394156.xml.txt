 Mr Tully ? ( Floorboard creaks ) ( Electrical humming ) ( Humming continues ) ( Humming intensifies ) ( Sharp whoosh ) ( Humming continues ) ( Overlapping voices ) 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' I 'm the one that 's responsible . I 'm the one who wants to get rid of you . Me , not them . So why punish them ? Everyone has to die . When it 's their time , yes , not your time ... as you have no say - you don 't belong with the living . - I 'm here , aren 't I ? - Then prove it . Shake my hand . Or come and sit down with me . Come on . Talk with me . Tell me your name . Perhaps we could have a nice , warm , human conversation . Ah , but you can 't do that , can you ? You don 't belong here , you don 't belong with us , you belong in the darkness . You and your friends . ( Electrical humming ) You 're dead . Every single one of you . Not for long we won 't be . ( Explosions , distant ) ( Metal clanging , distant ) ( Soldier ) ' Not for long we won 't be . ' ( Tully , with voice of 1st man ) What were you doing ? Jamie 's passed out . The air ... not enough air . 'Steel . ' ( Electrical humming ) How ... How deep are we ? - At the bottom ? - ( Scraping and sliding ) ( Echoing thuds ) No pumps working and we 're at the bottom . ( Sapphire , distorted ) 'Steel . I can 't breathe . ' Eh ? ( Tully ) Tanks full ... ( 1st man ) ' Tanks full ... ' - We 're at the bottom ... - ' We 're at the bottom ... ' - Right at the bottom . - ' Right at the bottom . ' ( Hollow echoing ) ( Sapphire , distorted ) ' Steel . ' ( Steel , voice of 2nd man ) Don 't talk , save the air . - Don 't talk ... - ' Don 't talk ... ' - Save the air . - ' Save the air . ' ( Sapphire ) Steel ... ( Steel ) It 's all right . It 's not all right , I can 't breathe . Here ... ( Man ) Help us . Please , help us . ( Electrical humming fades ) - You saw them ? - Yes . - You heard them ? - Yes . - Let 's get him onto the platform . - What ? He needs air . 57.3 you said . - His life expectancy . - That 's right , yes . - How old is he now ? - 52.9 . Then he 'll survive , won 't he ? You 're enjoying this , aren 't you ? Yes . You got more than you bargained for , though . It worked , didn 't it ? - They weren 't dressed as sailors . - No . So what were civilians doing on a submarine ? I couldn 't tell . - You 're the history expert . - When it makes sense , yes . When they called out to me for help ... - Probably trying to trick you . - Maybe . But was it as ghosts or living people ? It can 't have been as living people unless you were a ghost in their time . - I wasn 't . - Well , there you are , then . I don 't think they intend to be ghosts in this time period for long . - What do you mean ? - Not according to that soldier . Wake him up . Mr Tully ? Wake up , Mr Tully . Oh , thank you . - It wasn 't my asthma , was it ? - ( Steel ) No , it was not ! When you first came here , what did you do ? - They tried to kill us ... - No , they encouraged us to die . - You antagonised them . - When you came ... - You antagonised that ghost . - I meant to . And I intend to antagonise him even further if it helps me to find out who he is and why he decided to haunt this station . - Perhaps ... - Ask him nicely what his name was ? - I tried that . Come on , now . - Knowing how ... Are they behaving how your average ghost is supposed to behave ? Would all your pals at psychical HQ classify them as good or bad ghosts ? - That depends . - What about a priest ? Would he give them a favourable report ? Again , that depends . They attack us with their pasts , with their own deaths . I saved you from one experience , Sapphire saved me from another . - When you came ... - There wasn 't any trouble . No danger ? Just nice peaceful ghosts ? Until you people arrived , yes ! Everything was all right until you arrived ! - Mr Tully ... - I will not be placated . - He has a job to do . - And so have I. I seem to have no say in anything any more and look what 's happened . I would never think of making a ghost angry . That 's the way I do things . Unfortunately nobody is interested in the way I do things . ( Steel ) So what is your way ? - What ? ! - When you first came here , - what did you do ? - Do ? The ghosts weren 't sitting around here waiting for you ? No . I prevailed upon them to make contact . And how did you ... prevail upon them ? If you must know , I had a sitting . A one-man sitting . - A seance ? - Yes . - Where ? - In the buffet . - And the ghosts responded ? - They have to , it 's a summons . It wasn 't successful but it confirmed my belief . - Why wasn 't it successful ? - I 'm not very mediumistic . - Sapphire would make a good medium . - So ? - So why don 't we try it your way ? - My way ? Yes . Why don 't we have a seance ? - When ? - Right now . - After what happened in the hotel ? ! - What about it ? - When I had a seance I was friendly . - And ? - Well , you 've antagonised them . - Yes ? To summon them now , under these conditions , would be ... dangerous . ( Creaking ) Do they have music on submarines ? - Music ? - Yes . From a radio . In most cases they would have access to a radio , yes . But submarines don 't have wooden doors . Hardly . I heard somebody open a wooden door in the middle of the room . Then the laughter and the talking stopped . All the fun stopped . Where was this ? I told you , right in the middle of the room . Well , I 'm ready . - What about the lights ? - Mr Tully ? Yes . You can leave those but , er , put this one out , I think . Thermometer . A bit of candlelight , I think . - And the cotton threads ( ? ) - Not this time , no . Would you sit there , please ? - As long as you 're sure . - Sure ? - That this is what you want to do ? - I 'm sure . Sapphire ? Yes . - What 's that supposed to do ? - Make me feel better . Hands on the table top , please . Now we join hands . - Is this important ? - It 's vital . How did you manage when you had a one-man sitting ? Well , I just held my own hand . Ah . Now ... Would you like me in some auto-hypnotic state ? - Yes , please . - What ? It 's a self-induced hypnotic state between waking and sleeping . - Yes , that 'll be fine . - Right . - I want his name . - Shh . I want the soldier 's name . Yes , well give her a chance . Give it a chance . I think perhaps we should close our eyes . - Try to share the moment with her . - I prefer to stay awake . No one 's suggesting that you should sleep . I 've always believed on occasions like this that closing one 's eyes is ... well , courteous . - Courteous ? - I 've often felt in the past that ... spirits are rather like strangers paying a visit . A little bit shy , a little insecure . Why shouldn 't ... Yes . He doesn 't like this , Steel . He doesn 't like this , not from us . - I want his name . - No . No ! - His name . His name ! - No ! No ! Please , please ... You cannot be coercive , it never works that way . - Will you leave it to me ? - All right . Thank you . Now ... I 'm not interested in knowing your name ... or the names of any of you . Only if you wish to tell me . I want ... We want to help you . ( Electrical humming fades in and out ) ( Voice ) ' Help us ... 'Please ... help us . ' ( Electrical humming fades in and out ) Trials . They said there 'd be trials . It was a ... a last-minute decision . What kind of trials ? A court martial , something like that ? Was it a court martial ? Or the assizes , maybe ? What ? The trials . Oh , they were told . ( Cries out ) The sea ... Well , it 's the Channel really but ... I suppose you could call it the sea . Back by five , they were told . " You 'll be back by five . " It 'll be like any other working day . " - Who said this ? - They were told ! Sorry . Now ... tell us about the trials . We 're talking about the trials , aren 't we ? Back at five . Out at dawn and back by five . It 's like any other working day . Sea trials , are you talking about sea trials ? - Of course they are ! - For a submarine ? Yes ! Steel , there 's resentment here . There 's so much resentment . Please ... tell us about the submarine . About the trial . No . There 's no point in talking about it now . - But if you ... - There 's no point ! You 're sailors , are you ? ( West country accent ) Of course we 're not . They 're not sailors . That 's obvious , isn 't it ? Sailors get paid to take chances , get paid to die . ( With accent ) We don 't . We get paid to work . A day 's work . Back by five , they said . We never came back , did we ? What year was this ? 1938 . What are your jobs ? - Jobs ? - You say you 're not sailors . - Of course we 're not ! Lf ... - Why are you in the submarine ? We 're civilian workers . We 're civilian attached workers . Bright futures . Home by five . Huh ! That wreck should never have gone to sea . Home by five , they said . Yes ... What are your names ? - ( Without accent ) Can 't tell you . - Surely you can . - Anyway , there 's no point . - But if we can help you ... Don 't need it . We 've already got help , thanks . What kind of help have you got ? ( Electrical humming ) I want ... ( Humming intensifies ) Help me ... ( Humming continues ) Please ... ( Humming fades ) I think they 've said their piece . - Well , we know something about them . - Yes . - But isn 't that ... - It 's not enough . - But they volunteered that infor ... - They 'll give us bits of information - but I want the name of the soldier . - But it 's dangerous ... Sapphire ? Sapphire ! - Yes ? - The name of the soldier . We still need the name of the soldier . - They won 't communicate . - Then find someone else . Someone who once knew him . - There 's no one who knew him . - Then go further back into the past . Find someone who was close to him . Try , Sapphire . Into the past , into his past . - It 's a long way back , Steel . - Try . - It 's a long way back . - Try , Sapphire . Try . Oh , it 's such a long way ... - She mustn 't go back ... - Shh ! Sapphire ? It 's a warm day . Oh , it 's a beautiful , hot summer 's day ! Mmm ! There are flowers in full bloom . ( Laughs ) There 's such a lot of flowers ! But there 's no one here any more . - They 've all had to go . - There must be someone . Someone who was close to him . Just a minute ... Yes , there is someone . Yes , there is . ( Electrical humming ) Come on . Come on . ( Humming intensifies ) There ! No !

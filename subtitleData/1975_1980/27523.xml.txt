Somebelieve that theremayyet bebrothers ofman ... who evennowfight tosurvive ... far , faraway amongst thestars . Noble delegates ... I realizeyou are all anxious to get back toyour ships ... before our rendezvous with the Cylons ... but I think it appropriate ... to toast the most significant event in the history ofmankind . I would like to raise my chalice toyou- - not merely as the quorum of 1 2 ... representing the 1 2 colonies ofman ... but as my friends- - the greatest leaders ever assembled . As we approach the seventh millennium oftime ... the human race at last will find peace , thanks toyou . Peace . $ $ GALACTICA Starbuck , he 's comin ' . What areyou gonna say ? Zac , nowjust calm down . Why areyou so nervous ? He still thinks ofme as his little brother . Well , you 're acting like one . It 'sjust a routine patrol . - Why is it so important toyou ? - ' Cause it is . Look , I 'm a warrior . I earned that . I wanna prove that to him . I know , Zac , but this may not be the best time . It 's a peace envoy . What possible trouble could there be ? - That 's not the point . - Starbuck , you promised . I know . Starbuck , what areyou doin ' ? We 're goin ' on patrol . He can 't make it . Starbuck 's not feeling well . Yeah- - Well , it 's- - I don 't know . That 's kinda short notice . I mean , with everybody not wanting to go on this patrol- - everybodywants to celebrate the armistice- - I wonderwho I 'm gonna be able to find . Yes , Zac . You have a suggestion ? I 've studied the coordinates from here to the Cylon capital . My ship 's ready to go . - That 's lucky , isn 't it , Starbuck ? - Yeah , that 's a real stroke ofluck . Well , I guess you 'rejust gonna have to pull Starbuck 's patrol with me . - Were we ever like that ? - I can 't remember that far back . Listen , maybe I ought to go along . No , he 's gonna bejust fine . I mean , it 's not as ifwe 're at war , right ? - Seeya later . - Okay . - Take care ofthe stomach . - Yeah . I will . Section 1 2 , launch bay alpha .

Baltar , my friend ... this armistice conference would not have been possible ... withoutyour tireless work . You have secured foryourself a place in the history books . That the Cylons chose me as their liaison to the quorum ofthe 1 2 ... was an act ofprovidence , not skill . I see the party is not a huge success with all my children . What awaits us out there is what troubles me . Surelyyou don 't cling toyour suspicions about the Cylons . They asked for this armistice . - Theywant peace . - Forgive me , Mr. President ... but they hate us with every fiber oftheir existence . We love freedom . We love independence- - to feel , to question , to resist oppression . To them , it 's an alien way ofexisting theywill never accept . But they have ... through Baltar . They have sued for peace .

We picked up some signals , but they 're beingjammed . Could be smugglers or pirates or- - - Standing by . - Get me the president , please . Mr. President , ourpatrolis underattack . We don 't know bywhom . As a precautionary measure , I would like to launch intercept fighters . I should think that 's highly inadvisable ... in view ofthe delicacy ofour situation . You 're quite right , Baltar . Commander , as a precautionary measure , I insist upon restraint . Ifthis turns out tobean encounter withsome outlawtraFFIc ... we couldjeopardize the whole cause ofpeace ... by displaying fighters when we areso close to ourrendezvous . Mr. President , two ofmy starfighters are under armed attack . By forces unknown . Youarenot tolaunch until thesituationismore clear . Sir , may I at least urgeyou to bring the fleet to a state ofalert ? I willconsiderthat . Thankyou , Commander . He 'll consider it . He 'll consider it ? - It 's all right . - I 'm sorry , Commander . It 'sjust that- - - Well- - - Well , what ? The patrol is under the command ofCaptain Apollo . Well , ifI can 't have confidence in my firstborn son ... whom can I depend upon ? Commander , Zac is with him . It 's his first patrol . Thankyou . Givemeallyou 'vegot . Still no word from our fighters , sir . Their transmission is being deliberately jammed . Ifwe don 't launch- - We cannot launch . It 's been expressly forbidden . However ... this might be a very good time for battle stations drill . - Sound the alert , Colonel . - Yes , sir . You may never see another one , fellas . A perfect pyramid . Unless there 's a better hand , the pot 's mine . Unfortunately , we 'll have to finish later ! - Another time . - Wait ! Wait ! - Wait a minute ! Come back ! - Duty calls . Let 's go ! Come on ! Sir , our long-range scanner ... shows a large number ofships headed this way at high speed . A single patrol craft is approaching , Commander . Get that pilot here as soon as he lands . Get me the president . - What 's goin ' on ? - Nothing to worry about . Probably some kind ofaerial salute for the president ... while he signs the armistice . It sure ruined a good card game . - Commander ? - Mr. President . A wall ofunidentified craft is closing in on the fleet . Possibly a Cylon welcoming committee . Sir , may I suggest we launch a welcoming committee ofour own ? Mr. President , there remain many hostile feelings amongst ourwarriors . Thelikelihood ofan unfortunateincident ... with all those pilots in the sky at once ? Commander ? Sir , did Count Baltar suggest that our forces sit here totally defenseless ? My friend , we are on a peace mission- - the first peace man has known in a thousand years . Standbytoattack . Come on , baby . Notmuch farther . Blue Flag2in trouble .

Pull up , Boomer . I 'll trytogethim off ! . Niceshootin ' ! Captain , we have to know how many base ships we 're dealing with . - No base ships . - You must be mistaken , Captain . Fighters couldn 't function this far from Cylon without base ships . - They don 't carry enough fuel . - Just fighters- - maybe a thousand . How doyou account for that , Apollo ? I don 't know . We picked up an empty tanker on our scanner . It 's my guess the Cylons used it to refuel for the attack ... after flying to that point from wherever their base ships are . Why operate this far from Cylon without base ships when it isn 't necessary ? Theywould have been well out ofour range at the old moon . Unless it was necessary ... for them to be somewhere else . Get me the president ! Hey , Starbuck , it 's dangerousaroundhere . Mr. President , I request permission to leave the fleet . I have reason to suspect our home planets may face imminent attack . - Atlantia toallbattlestars . - Maintain contact . Fire 's outofcontrol . Request Vipers . HowcouldI havebeenso completely wrong ?

Have my shuttle craft prepared , please . Shuttle craft ? I 'm going down on the surface ofCaprica . That is out ofthe question . If the Cylon scanners should pickyou up- - You will continue to rendezvous with the survivors ofthe fleet . I 'll takeyou in my fighter . You 're the last surviving member ofthe council .

What areyou saying about my father ? Doyou realize what we 'vejust been through ? Yeah ? You should have seen how we spent our day . I managed to single-handedly keep the Cylons offyour neck ... whileyou took a little cruise ! - Don 'tyou realize what 's happened ? - Oh , yeah . Sure . You should see this baby from the air when it takes offacross the sky . It 's a beautiful sight , unless it happens to beyour base ship . Starbuck , listen to me ! The colonies are gone . - All ofthem . - What areyou talking about , gone ? I 'm sorry , Ila . I was never there when it mattered . Never . Wait a minute . Stay together . This way . - There must be food somewhere . - I 'm hungry . Father ? There are crowds coming . They probably saw our ship land . I wasjust gathering a few things here . - This likeness ofyou and Zac- - - Father , we can 't stay . Maybe Motherwasn 't here . She was here . Where were they ? Where were they ? Where were the rest ofyou fancy flyers ? Where wereyou when they killed the rest ofus ? What wereyou doin ' , boy ? Wait ! Wait ! Let him talk . I want to know whereyou were as well . All ofyou . We waited . We watched and prayed , and you never came . Most ofus are dead . - The fleet is all but destroyed . - Butyou 're here . - From the battlestar Galactica . - It survives ? Yes . What ofthe president and the Council of 1 2 ... and all the other colonies ? All destroyed . - CommanderAdama . - Yes , Serina . It 's true , then . We are defeated , doomed . Can I ride in your ship , sir ? Fighter planes are no place for little boys . They 're going to have to be ifour people are going to survive . We must fight back . Yes , we are going to fight back .

And what is the standing order for humans from your imperious leader ? Extermination . Then carry outyour orders , and ifthey exist ... they 're doomed . we gatherhere as representatives ofeachship in our fleet ... to answer that single question : Where will we go ? Our recorded history tells us that we descended ... from a mother civilization ... a race that went out into space to establish colonies . Those ofus here assembled now ... represent the only known surviving colonies , save one . A sisterworld , far out in the universe ... remembered to us only through ancient writings . It is my intention to seek out that remaining colony ... that last outpost ofhumanity in the whole universe . CommanderAdama . This 1 3th colony , this otherworld- - Where is it and what is it called ? Where is it and what is it called ? I wish I could tell you that I know preciselywhere it is ... but I can 't . However , I do know that it lies beyond our star system ... in a galaxy very much like our own ... on a planet called ... Earth . Earth ! FlightLeader 17 byyourcommand . Report , Centurian , on the final assault . On each ofthe 12planets asimilarstoryis told ... ofahandfulofships who escapeddestruction ... torendezvous witha warship . - What kind ofwarship ? - A battlestarcalled Galactica . Then go and seek out Baltar . Tell him I am displeased . Tell him I offer a choice . Deliver the battlestar Galactica ... or deliver his head . This is Alpha shuttle approaching freighter Gemini ... forfleetdamage andsupplysurvey . Pleaseprepare toreceive . It isn 't the worst duty in the fleet , asking a lot ofquestions . I hear they 're sending some poor guys from Beta section ... crawling around on the outside of an old skybus looking for a solium leak . Wonder how they missed us for that detail . - Excuse me , but- - - Shh ! Would you mind telling us whatyou 're looking for ? Solium leaks ! - Bye ! - Halt ! Apollo- - Captain , that stuffis dangerous . These old ships shouldn 't even be flying . There reallywasn 't much choice , was there ? How many people did we leave behind for lack ofships ? Unless you 're willing to volunteer permanent assignment on this tub ... you 'll help survey each and every ship in this fleet for damage ... or I just might be tempted to loan you guys out to Beta company . Just keep it up , old buddy . You 're gonna get us into real trouble . Ten thousand light-years from nowhere , our planet 's shot to pieces ... people starving , and I 'm gonna get us in trouble ? - Look , all I 'm saying- - - What is the matterwith you ? I tell ya , may as well live for today . We might not have many left . What 's going on ? We want some food . Yeah . I see it . - Where 's the food ? - Everything 's gonna be taken care of . - Just be patient . - But we haven 't had water in two days . We will have food and water toyou as soon as possible . Just give us a little water ! Can 'tyou bring us some water ? - Wejust need a little bit ofwater ! - Where 's the food ? Why haven 't we seen or heard from anybody in two days ? Please tell us what 's going on . - Have we been left behind ? - No , you haven 't . Just be patient . Your needs will be attended to . Just be glad you 're alive . - What 's she saying ? - It 's Gemonese . Boomer can translate . Boomer 's tied up . Anyone here can help ? Does anyone here understand Gemonese ? - The woman said her husband is feverish . - What 's wrong with your arm ? There are others in greater need than I. Get her out ofhere . She should bejettisoned with the dead . No place for refuse here . Feed her to the daggits . Dirty socialator . It 's a sin to starve us while the bureauticians ... luxuriate in their private sanctuaries . No one is in luxury , I can promiseyou that . No , you 're lying . I saw it with my own eyes aboard the RisingStar ... before I was cast out and put here among the bories ofhumanity . Core Control is aware ofthe problem . Then I can tell them food and water is on the way ? - They 're aware ofthe problem . - What areyou saying ? There 's something you 're not telling us . Reliefis on the way . You have myword as a warrior . Yourword as a warrior ? Ican 'tfault them forresenting us . Theylosteverything . Theyhave toblamesomeone . Core Command , this is Alpha requesting clarification on fooddispersal . Core Command , noinformation availableat this time . What areyou talking about ? I just left a ship filled with starving people . what 'sgoingon ? I 'm sorry , Shuttle Alpha . Core Command has no information available at this time . Commander , this is Colonel Tigh . It 's starting . Something 's wrong . What 'd they tell you when you called in the food shortage ? Same thing they told you : vague acknowledgement ofthe problem . Boomer , I 'm getting an awful uneasy feeling . Why don 'tyoujust give meyour name , okay ? It 's all right . My name is Cassiopeia . Cassiopeia . It 's beautiful . It means " fairy queen , " doesn 't it ? I think so . And designation ? I 'm designated a socialator . It 's an honorable profession practiced ... with the blessings ofthe elders for over 4,000 years . I didn 't say anything . I wasjust curious about what all that excitement was about back on the barge . That woman- - That woman is a member ofthe Otori sect amongst the Gemonese . They don 't believe in physical contact between genders ... except when sanctified by the priests ... during high worship ofthe sun storm ... which comes once only every seven years . No wonder those little buggers are such good card players . Core Command , this is Alpha Shuttle . Changing course to rendezvous starliner RisingStar . Shuttle will proceed on to Galactica with patients for life station . Hey , what areyou up to ? Ifyou don 't mind my asking , sir . I want to see what 's at the bottom ofthis conspiracy ofsilence . Passengerliner Rising Star ... this is Sigma Shuttle on fleetdamageandsupplysurvey . Prepare toreceive . Contaminated ? Weren 't the provisions checked before theywere boarded ? For radiation , yes . There wasn 't time to check for pluton poisoning . Pluton breaks down the structure offood . All ofthis is worthless ? We don 't know thatyet . Jolly , haveyour crews go through every container . Chances are some ofit was shielded enough from the bombs to be saved . We went through three ships since last night . It isn 't looking good . Salvage anything you can . Even small scraps will help . And what do we do with the rest ofit ? Jettison it . Keep a lid on the problem . People find out we haven 't any food , we 're gonna have a mutiny on our hands . We 're going up to the second level . Captain ! - Yes ? - I heard thatyou 'd come aboard . I wonder ifI might borrowyou for a moment . We 're on an important survey for the commander right now . - It won 't take very long . - Boomer , go up to elite class ... see ifthere 's anything goin ' on we should be concerned about . You won 't like whatyou find . I 'll be along presently . It 's my son . He hasn 't moved in two days . He lost a little daggit which meant everything to him . I thoughtyou might be able to help . Ifhe won 't eat foryou , I don 't know what I can do . He seemed to spark a little when you picked him up on Caprica . I got the feeling you were good with children . I grew up with a kid brother . Where is he ? There . Excuse me . I 'm in charge offinding young men to try out as future fighter pilots . - Your name is ? - Boxey . Just what I thought . You 're right at the top ofmy list . I 've been looking foryou . You should have made contact with the commander . - We 're very short on fighter pilots . - I 'm too little to be a pilot . Oh , sure , right now ... but how long doyou think it takes to become a full colonial warrior ? I don 't know . You have to start when you 're very small ... oryou won 't get these until you have gray hair . - You like them ? - I want Muffit . Well , there 's not much room for a daggit in a fighter plane . He 's gone . He ran away . Well- - Well , maybe we can find one of Muffit 's friends . I asked . There are no daggits . I 'll tell you what . As a colonial warrior , first level ... you are entitled to the first daggit that comes along . But only on the condition thatyou getyour rest ... closeyour eyes ... eat all your primaries ... and stop chasing girls . Thankyou . I was right . You are good with kids . You and your brother must be very close . We were . I 'm sorry . - Ifyou 'd rather not be involved , I- - - Hey , don 't be silly . What 's a warrior to do after he 's lost the big one ? Win a few little ones . That 's not a little one in there , Captain . Genestess is a private accommodation ... secured by Sire Uri and his party . I 'm being paid byTranstellar- - Now . Hey , what 's goin ' on , Boomer ? Nothing . Just that the fella here didn 't seem to want to let us into the club area . Thankyou . I trustyou have an explanation for this intrusion . Would you like to make a statement before I arrestyou , Sire Uri ? I 'm glad you know my name . At leastyou 'll know from where the blade fell . I 'm gonna giveyou about a micron tojoin me on my shuttle . After that , I 'll just turn the six levels ofstarving passengers loose ... and letyou take your chances with them . Captain , why don 'tyoujoin us in our prayer ofgratitude for deliverance ? In case it eluded you , Counselor ... some hundred people have died since our deliverance from the Cylons ... and while hunger hasn 'tyet taken a life ... it 's only a matter oftime now . Boomer , notify Core Command that we have located some stores ... which we will distribute as far as they go . No , it 's mine . It belongs to me and my guests . Does yourwife shareyour feelings about denying your food to others ? - Mywife ? - Siress Uri . I don 't see her . Unfortunately , she was not in time to make the voyage . My sympathies . I shareyour bereavement . - Siress Uri was an outstanding woman . - Yes . I 'm sure she 'd be moved byyour period ofmourning . Boomer , haveJolly come up here with a crew and distribute this food . Without being critical , Captain , wouldn 'tyou say ... you overplayed our hand just a tad ... considering Sire Uri is a member ofthe newly elected Council ofthe 1 2 ? How doyou overplay starvation ? How 's it feel ? It feels like it 's never even been broken . The bone 's been fused whole . It 's stronger than before . It 's wonderful . Look ! Look ! Look at my arm ! You 're waiting to take me back , aren 'tyou ? It isn 't easy to find a ride around here . I dread returning to that ship . Maybe I can check around and see ifthere 's anyplace elseyou can go . There are better ships . Would you be doing this ifI weren 't a socialator ? Hey , listen , can we forget my littlejokes back on the shuttle , huh ? Look , I- - I just want to helpyou . Really . It 's nothing personal . - Nothing personal ? - No . - Absolutely nothing . - Really ? I swear . But I thinkyou 're making a terrible deal . The long-range patrol 's reporting in . Alta techscannersshow nosign ofCylonpursuit . All vectors lookinggood . - Commander . - Yes , I heard . That 's good news . Apparently we 've made good our escape . Finding us now would be almost impossible ... assuming we don 't make any mistakes . Carillon is too far away . We will never make it because ofthe food disaster . There is no other destination . Ah , but there is . We can stop here ... on Borallus . We know that everything we need is there- - food , fuel and water . And , undoubtedly , a Cylon task force . It is the most logical place for us to stop . Preciselywhy it would be fatal . - Hey , whereyou goin ' ? - Possibly fatal . Is it not surely fatal to continue towards Carillon ? There is anotherway , ifI may have a few moments ofthe council 's time . I support CommanderAdama 's rejection of Borallus . Surprising . It is a death trap as lethal as the one we left behind ... and we haven 't the armament to fight ourway in and out . However , there is another approach to Carillon . Instead ofusing the intended route ... which takes us centons out ofourway ... I suggest we take the direct path here ... through the Nova of Madagon . Not patrolled , and a savings ofcentons in reaching Carillon . Captain , I may not be a military expert ... but I do know that the Cylons don 't have ... to patrol that particular area because they mine it . They lay mines to make passage impossible . A fleet ofcumbersome ships like ours to even attempt ... to go through that narrow passage- - I agree . The fleet could not traverse the channel ... unless it had been cleared first . And how would you propose doing that ? Well , I suggest I find one or two volunteers ... tojoin me in flying ahead ofthe fleet ... to blow the minefield apart with laser torpedoes . - Good idea . - Two " volunteers . " Out ofthe question . Out ofthe question ! Brilliant , brilliant . Ifwe must go straight ahead , as you insist , Adama , then this is the way . - I saywe support the captain . - Good foryou . My boy , as grave a plan as it is , it appears to be our only hope . You have the support and the blessing ofthe Council ofthe 1 2 . Thankyou . You wanna guess who he 's got in mind to volunteer for that ? - Hey , wait . - I 'm getting out ofhere . Well , just the two fellas I wanted to see . Follow me , gentlemen . See ? I told you . He still won 't eat . I thinkwe may have found something that 's going to interest him . Tonight ? Shouldn 'tyou be getting some rest ? I 'll sleep better after we solve Boxey 's problem . - That 's a tall order . - I 'm a big boy . Okay , Boxey . You 're gonna love this , Boxey . As you know , we will soon be landing ... on various alien planets . It 's important that we be safe . Ordinarily , we 'd use trained daggits to stand watch at night ... while ourwarriors slept in their encampments ... but we didn 't have any daggits ... so wejust had to see what we could come up with . We 'll call the first one Muffit 2 . Naturally , the first one will have to be very carefully looked after . That 's not Muffit . He 's not even a real daggit . No , but he can learn to be like a real one . He 's very smart . And ifyou would help us , it will be even smarter . Stop that . We used the image of Boxey you gave us ... to train the drone to respond to him . - I oweyou one , Doc . - Anytime . That 's one I oweyou . Call it even . It 's somehow beautiful . It 's a perfect machine ! Born to dance amongst the stars . Yeah , it 's bumping into them that has me worried . Why did you volunteer , Starbuck ? Well , somebody had to do it . Did Apollo makeyou ? Yes , you certainly have a way ... ofcutting through the feldercarb . Doyou ever take that smoldering weed out ofyour mouth ? And I had this wonderful speech all prepared . About this being your last night here ... about possibly not seeing another night as beautiful as this one ... or another girl as beautiful as I am ever again . Yeah , well , that speech is a little better than the one I had . Would you mind ifI borrowed it on some future occasion ? Doyou mind ifwe don 't spend too much more time in the launching bay ? Can you think ofanyplace more private ? I can 't think ofanyplace private in the whole damn fleet . - What 's in there ? - That 's the launching tube . You don 't wanna go in there . It 's dark and cold and- - Oh , Lord , I 'll do anything you ask tomorrow . Just don 't call an alert tonight . Colonel , haveyou seen Lieutenant Starbuck , by any chance ? No , I don 't think I- - Wait , I did see him on one ofthe monitors earlier . Before we shut down the flight deck , I think he was checking out a ship . - That would seem to make sense . - I 'm sure he 's long gone by now ... getting a good night 's sleep for the mission . Why don 'tyou do the same ? You are going to be working . That little snake . The Nova of Madagon is not a nova at all ... but a star field so bright our cockpits will be sealed to prevent blindness . We 'll navigate by scanner and sweep everything out ofour path ... with turbo lasers . You feeling all right ? You 're fidgeting around like a daggit on a sunspot . It 's my bio-pulse line , sir . It 's a bad time for me to be cooped up in a cockpit . Starbuck 's being polite . Seems he got a steam burn . I don 't wanna askyou howyou got it , because I need you on this mission . I didn 't chooseyou to help lead us through without a great deal ofanguish . Ifit 'll do any good , let me assureyou ... that should we fail , no one will survive . The rest ofour friends must sit in anticipation ofour skill . Or lack thereof . - Ready ? - Ready . - Starbuck ? - I 'm not ready ... but let 's get it overwith . Nova star field ahead .

When there is no other side . You have missed the entire point ofthe war . But I have no ambitions againstyou . Could you think me so foolish as to trust a man ... who would see his own race destroyed ? Not destroyed . Subjugated under me . There can be no survivors . So long as one human remains alive ... the alliance is threatened . Surelyyou- - you don 't mean me . We thankyou foryour help , Baltar . - Your time is at an end . - No ! You can 't !

Don 't shoot me ! What doyou want ? Wait . Don 't be afraid . Listen- - Hey , you 're from Taura . - I 'm a Taurus . How doyou know that ? - The dialect . Listen , what is this place ? - What areyou doing here ? - What areyou doing here ? Colonial warriors sneaking around a resort with yourweapons drawn . - Oh , sorry . - This is legal ! Isn 't it ? Well , how did you get here ? - Oh ! I came in a skybus . - She must have been smoking plant vapor . Hey , wait , listen . Could you tell us something about this bus ? My travelator took care ofall ofit . Isn 't it fabulous here ? All this for so little money . Oh , and I just won a thousand- - over a thousand cubits . - Isn 't that amazing ? - You won those cubits here ? Oh , in here everybody 's doing it . It 's incredible . You know , ifit 's illegal , you 're gonna have to fight the whole star system . I have to go ! I have a moonlight cruise . Two moons . Oh , how can you go wrong ? I don 't get it . How cut offcan these people be ? She didn 't act like she 'd even heard about the destruction ofthe colonies . There 's something even more peculiar . Why haven 't we heard about this place ? I supposeyou know every gambling chancery in this star system , huh ? Oh , that 's right . That 's right . Ifthere 's a game going on , you 'd know about it . The odds must be incredible here . People are winning a fortune . Yes , and they 're obviouslywell-fed . Why don 't we find out about who 's in charge ofthis place ... and see about getting some food back up to the fleet . The last thing these people maywant to find ... is a battlestar sitting on their front door . I haven 't found a gambling den yet ... that didn 't depend on military payvouchers to keep its doors open . Boomer , until we find out who these people are ... remember it 'll only take one informer ... and we 'll have the whole Cylon war machine on its way . I wanna look around , sit in on a game or two ... see ifI can find out what 's behind this place . Your mission , Boxey , is to keepyour eye on that readout . When the counter gets up to ten , it means we 're right on top ... - ofa rich tylium deposit . - Yes , sir . - We 'd better talk . - Right . - It 's love - Love , love , love - They can 't read our lips in here . - Who ? Whoever might be up to something in this place . Well , Boomer , one thing this place isn 't is crooked . - Where 'd you get all those cubits ? - Gambling . I 'm telling you , Boomer . - You can 't lose . - That 's what I 'm talkin ' about . You ever been in a gambling chancery whereyou couldn 't lose ? No , but then I 've never been here before either . Itdon 'tmatter whereyougo It won 'tmatter whatyoudo 'Causesomething 's alwaysafteryou We could make a fortune ifwe put those girls on the star circuit . I mean , big money , Boomer . Big money . Big money , huh ? Every creature in the universe is out to exterminate us ... and you wanna hire a vocal group . I 'm telling you , there 's something just not right about this place . It 's love I gotta talk to those girls . Quiet , Muffit . I see it . Tylium . - Nice going , Boxey . - That 's a pretty hot reading . We may be right on top ofthat old mine . I 'd better check it out . Okay , Jolly , keepyour eyes open . - I 'll bring him back . - Hey , Boxey ! Boxey , wait right here . I 'm gonna get him back . - Thankyou . - Forwhat ? For saving my son 's life . You 're getting things a little out ofproportion . In a way , maybe I should be thanking you . You don 't know anything about me orwhat happened to Boxey 's father- - When you 're ready , you 'll tell me . In the meantime , nothing that 's gone on before really counts for much . As far as the human race is concerned ... we 're all starting over . Darn you , daggit , where areyou ? - Any sign of Boxey ? - I 'm afraid not . What is it ? - What 's happening on this planet ? - I don 't know . This may be the largest tylium mine in the star system . I don 't care . I just want to know what 's happened to Boxey . welcome to Carillon . - Youare impressed ? - Confused would be more like it . Listen , we 've lost a little boy . He issafe. we foundhim andbroughthim here . - wouldyoucare tojoinhim ? - Yes , we would . Mommy ! Captain , good fortune smiles on us . Yeah , it 's like nothing we ever dreamed of , Captain . They 've got everything we need here , plenty , and they 're happy to share . - Sounds like paradise . - Yeah , it does . Colonel , a message from Sire Uri . " The Ovion people have extended to the survivors ofthe colonies ... every measure ofgoodness and support we might have hoped for . " " Itisnowpossible to foresee the fleetable toresume our voyage ... within a centon . " Well , Colonel ... a most optimistic note . Too optimistic . Uri has everyone in the fleet ... breaking in the bulkheads to get down to the surface . Well , perhaps in small numbers , in orderly rotation . It isn 't going to be that way . Already he 's authorized visitors ' permits ... to halfour population . Halfthe population ? we 've comeso far , so quickly . There 'sbeenlittle time forreason . whatis the curioussecret behindthe existence ofthis outpost ... on the outerrim ofourstarsystem ? Therearemanysuch oases forintergalactic travelers ... butnoneso faroFF theknownarteries oftrade ... andnoneso curiously close toa tylium mine . Fuelhasbegun toarrive from the Ovionmines ... but in curiously small quantities . And now I feel the growing need ... for extraordinary measures ofprecaution . Theships continue tohover overtheplanet ... supportedby smallmaintenance crews ... whosespiritsare as depleted as theirnumbers . Everyone seems to have forgotten our flight from the Cylons . The beauty and wiles ofCarillon ... holdourpeople spellbound . Let ' em ride . Hello , Starbuck . This is my lucky night . Just might be . Yeah , well , money isn 't everything . No ? Listen , haveyou checked out the accommodations yet ? Most ofmy unit is staying down on Carillon tonight . I 'll see what I can arrange . - Areyou going to play , sir ? - Oh , I hope so . Yeah , sure . Let ' em ride again . It 's my lucky night . Can 't lose . Is this seat taken ? Oh , well , it 's- - I came because I oweyou an apology . - You do ? - Come on . This paradise ? It 's the perfect opportunity for us to be ... open and honest with one another . I hurtyou . Admit it . Well , it- - Didn 'tyou once tell me I was the onlywoman ... you 'd ever had any real and deep feelings toward ? I may have said that . You may have said that ? Athena , wait , wait . What I meant to say is ... I 've had to shut all those feelings out ofmy mind ... to avoid any more pain than I 've already suffered . Hello . Excuse me . I believe you 're occupying my space . - Your space ? - Yes . I have good news . I got us the key to the royal suite . Why , thankyou . We do appreciate it . Say , listen , girls . I 've got this hot streak going here . - I see . - Yes , I do too . Well , have a good time , you two . And next time , it 's at office rates , Lieutenant . Never eaten so much in my entire life . I 'm gonna be as fat as a pig . Push level three for us , please . I feel like a total glutton , Answaw . Nothing fits me anymore . And we 've only been down on the surface for three- - I asked you to push the third level . You 've missed our lodging . I did press it . Something seems to be wrong . Well , there are no lodgings this far down . Look there ! It seems to be taking us all the way to the bottom . - Something seems to be happening . - Let me at that control . There . We 've stopped . Thank goodness . I wonderwhat 's down here . What is the purpose ofthis special council ? Adama , I 'm afraid I must askyou ... to respect the order ofbusiness ... until called upon by this chair . I think Counselor Uri has a measure to propose . Thankyou . My brothers , a hasty attempt to outrun the Cylons ... spawned in the midnight ofdesperation ... seems foolhardy in the light ofday . I propose , instead , we now attempt to appeal forjustice and mercy . Justice ? Justice from the Cylons ? Is that what you actually said ? Gentlemen , they 've told us ... that theywould not stop until every human had been exterminated . Now , why should they believe we are now willing to accept ... that which we have always found to be unacceptable ? To live under Cylon rule ? Because we would destroy our arms ... to prove we 're willing to live in peace . - Destroy our only means ofdefense ? - Or attack . May I remind my brothers ... that we did not have conflict with the Cylons ... until we intervened in their relations with other nations . Yes , you are right . We did not come into conflict with the Cylons ... until we helped our neighbors , whom the Cylons wished to enslave ... and until we helped the Hasaries get back their nation ... taken by force by the Cylons . Correct . But ifwe mind our own business ... there 's every reason to believe that the Cylons will leave us alone . Ifyou 've all come to this council to turn your backs ... on the principles ofour fathers and the Lords of Kobol ... from whom all colonies evolved ... you do so with my utter contempt . Warriors are always the last ... to recognize the inevitability ofchange . We have a choice : life or death . I submit that an issue this grave should be decided by our people . Maybeyou 're right . But I 'll tell you something . The military won 't be easy to convince . How , may I ask , doyou propose to present such a delicate matter ? At a celebration ... to decorate those three braveyoung men ... who led us to safety through the perilous straits of Madagon . One ofthem Adama 's son , I do believe . Just the tonic our people need at this moment . Some old-fashioned , down-to-goodness heroes . - Afteryou . - Thankyou . Party 'sjust gettin ' started . Doyou want a little company ? I 'm kinda companied out . Thankyou . You 're gonna miss the tribute for the three warriors . I 've given ' em all the tribute they 're gonna get . - We missed my level . - Mine too . Something seems to be wrong . - We 're going all the way down . - I didn 't think that was allowed . I wonderwhat 's down there . Help me ! What are they doing with us ? Okay , 30-70 . You guys split 70 % , and I 'll even pick up the transportation . I just don 't think it 'll work out . Why not ? - Look , I can 't talk now . - What doyou mean ? We 'll just have to talk about it later , ifyou 're still around . Wait ! Whereyou goin ' ? You 're my meal ticket out ofthe military . What areyou doing ? The captain 's been lookin ' all over foryou . You know , Boomer , I 'm beginning to agree with you . Something 's goin ' on here . Well , whatever it is , it 's gonna have to wait . We 've gotta get back . - What for ? - Dress uniform . Wait . I 'm not gettin into any fancy- - One does not accept our people 's highest military honor ... the Gold Cluster , in a battle suit . - The Gold Cluster ? You 're kidding . - We got it . Commander ? Commander . Just like old times , isn 't it , Tigh ? Well , our ships weren 't quite so fancy , but we gave them a good run . Yes . You didn 't tell anyone we were meeting ? - No . - Good . Is there some reason whyyou and I aren 't supposed to be talking ? Pick up that ground crew communicator ... and climb into the next ship , please . - Climb into the next ship ? - Quickly . You 'repatchedinto myinternalcomsystem . weare completelyisolated . No one canhearus . Yes . I understand . But whywould anyone want to ? Itgrievesme to think that wehave to takesuchprecautions ... on ourownbattlestar . Sire Uri 'smen are expectingme ... tomakesomekindofmove overhis disarmamentplan . Ifindthatevenmyprivate quarters arebeingmonitored . Now , whatI 'm about topropose issomewhatrisky . Youdon 'thave togoalong ifyoudon 't want to . Commander , ifyousay weshoulddoit ... naturallyIsay weshoulddoit . whatisit we 'reabout to do ? Tigh , when wouldbe ... themostdevastating time fora Cylonstrike ? Almostanytime , withhalfofour warriors down on- - During the celebration ... whenallofour warriors are down on Carillon . Ifwe wereattacked ... withoutbeingable torecallour warriors ... we wouldn 'thavea chance . A few well-placedCylonbombs ... in theheart ofthis launchingbay ... andwe wouldn 'tbeable toget asingle fighterinto theair . Then , youdo think there 'smore to Carillon thangenerosity ? Itsmells likea trap . Itfeels likea trap . Ibelieveitisa trap . Itis imperative ... that wegetourpilots closerto ourships . Orperhaps the other wayaround- - getourships closerto ourpilots . Howdo wegetour fighterships ... down to Carillon without gettingcouncil clearance ? well , we 'lllaunch a coupleata time ... as ifthey werepart ofourregularpatrol . The councilhas orderedall ofour warriors tobeat theparty . They willbe there , inamannerofspeaking . Now , Uri doesn 'tknow allofour warriors onsight . He 'llbe counting uniforms , notmen . He 'llbe counting uniforms ? Yes . I wantyou to collect ... all the warrioruniforms youcanpossiblylayyourhands on ... andfill them with whomeveryoucan find- - mechanics , kitchenpersonnel , anyone- - andget them down to thatparty . - whatdo I tell them ? - Tell them anything . Tell them they 're onasecretmission , which is the truth . I 'll do mybest . I 'm depending uponyou , Tigh . IfI 'm right ... Uri won 'tbe the onlyone who 'llbe counting uniforms ... at thatpartytonight . Iunderstand , andIhopeyouare wrong . well , we 'llsee . - What areyou doing , Colonel ? - Felder- - I didn 't mean to startleyou . Can we giveyou a hand with- - Ifyou ever do that again , you 're on report , Starbuck ! You can tell the rest ofyour playboy pilots ... this is not the last flash inspection that I 'm gonna make . IfI ever find uniforms in this condition , you 're in trouble . When CommanderAdama sees these , he 's gonna go crazy . It 's gotta be the pressure . You know , it 's unfair . A lot ofthose bridge officers never go down to the surface ... while everybody else gets to go and have a good time . Bridge officers don 't get their tails shot off ... flying around in little fighters . Still , I wouldn 't mind trading with them . I believeyou . I 'll mention it to the colonel . Wait a minute . I can 't take over for him . I 'm not a colonel . Neither am I. So much for guilt . Let 's go to the party . Right . Hello , Father . Apollo . Well ... Colonel Tigh wants to be at the celebration ... so I offered to relieve him for the night . Simply as a favor . I might have thoughtyou 'd like to see your son getting his Star Cluster . It 's well-deserved , Apollo . Well-deserved . Preciselywhy I cannot accept it as anything ... but another one ofCounselor Uri 's ploys . How can saluting his greatest rival 's son be a ploy ? I just have the feeling that he 'll propose destroying our arms ... at the celebration ... hoping that the cascade ofemotion ... will do all the damage before anyone realizes what they 've done . - Butyou can stop him . - I ? Not anymore . Haven 'tyou heard the talk ? I got us into this predicament . No one believes that . And even ifsome do , you have to speak out . How can I say toyou thatyou 've been more than a father to me ? You 've been someone I could look up to with trust and respect . My ideals rise and fall on your standards , and this isn 'tyou . What 's happening toyou ? Help me to understand . You 'll understand , my son . In time , you 'll understand . I know that wasn 't easy foryou , not telling him . - Perhaps you should have . - No . IfI told him , I wouldn 't have been able to keep him from my side . This is my gamble . IfI win , we all win . But ifyou 're wrong , Uri will destroyyou . I 'm not wrong . The Cylons lured me into their deception once . Never again . - That 's very strange . - What is ? That man 's insignia is Blue Squadron . I thought I knew everybody in it , and look at the fit ofthat uniform . Apollo , tonight is a night ofthanksgiving ... and everyone 's dressing up and making do with whatever they have . He probably hasn 't worn that in years . Besides , the guest ofhonor looks absolutely delicious . How lovely you look in your uniform . Hey , isn 't this something , Boxey ? Our hosts have been very generous . - I don 't like them . - What ? I told him the Ovions wouldn 't approve ofhim ... bringing Muffit to the celebrations . Well , we put one over on them , didn 't we ? Except foryour captain , I deduce from the uniforms ... that most ofyourwarriors are here . Yes , well , I 'm always a big draw . Muffit , Muffit , come back here ! Here , daggit ! Come back here ! What is it ? I 'm talking to the great and near great . Well , when you come down , tell me who that is . Those three guys right behind the dancer . Darned ifI know . They sure have lousy tailors . - Starbuck , you should know them . - Why should I know them ? Because they 're wearing the insignia from our squadron . Don 't start without me . Where is the lieutenant going ? - To find the captain , sir . - Excellent . Hey , what 's going on ? - Stop those guys . Stop them . - What areyou- - What areyou doing , Starbuck ? Listen , something 's going on around here . Those three impostors , I just- - Listen . Can we talk ? Yeah . Will you excuse us ? The lieutenant needs attention . I 'll take Boxey and get something to eat . Where is Boxey ? He 's probably in watching the acrobats . They 're pretty good . Well , don 't be long . You two don 't want to miss your own coronation . - What 's this about impostors ? - I don 't know . I 've been running into guys all night who aren 't from our unit ... but they 're wearing our unit 's clothes . - That officer in the shuttle . - You spotted one ofthem ? Yeah , maybe . I think we 'd better check this out . I suggest that you find your two friends ... and tell them that we 're going to begin , with orwithout them . Yes , sir . - Looks deserted . - Everyone 's at the party . Not everyone . There are three impostors down here someplace . Howmany warriors ? Nearly their fullcomplement ofwarriors . See that thehumans remain entertaineduntil the end ... then they willbeyours in thelowerchambers . This night we celebrate a most special event ... in the annals ofhuman experience . - Starbuck , what 'd you find ? - They 're not here . - They must be at another level . - The other levels aren 't accessible . - I 've been wondering about that . - Yeah , so have I. I know how to fix that problem . Stand back . You 're the gambler . Pick a level . What saywe have a look at what 's furthest from the guest rooms ? Nice . You 're the leader . ... against any living brother , whether a former friend or foe . ... he 'll be remembered in the eons as- - Me and my big mouth . At least we know the secret ofCarillon . Do we ? What 's the connection between the casino and all this ? Let 's get out ofhere , then figure that one out . Run , Boxey , run ! - Apollo , you thinking what I 'm thinking ? - With all this tylium ... we 're setting fire to the biggest bomb in the universe . - It 's a little late to talk to them . - I think so . Oh , my God ! Some ofthem are probably from our ships . No wonder no one 's ever left here to tell about this resort . The Ovions are living offofthem ... and probably selling the tylium they mine to the Cylons . - That 's Muffit ! - Hey , Boxey , come back here ! Let 's go ! Follow me ! Report , Centurian . Itis done , Imperious Leader . Let the attack begin . Byyourcommand , Imperious Leader . We 're doing fine ! Whoops . - There 's too many ofthem . - Go for the ceilings . Set fire to the tylium . That must be whyyou 're a captain . Callout the entire garrison . Scanner 's picking up a large body ofobjects closing rapidly . Scan for alien forms . A wiping clean ofthe slate ofanimosities and prejudice . - This way ! This way ! - Run , Boxey ! Captain , whereyou guys been ? We 've been looking all over foryou ! Come on ! Move ! When these fires reach hyper-combustion , the whole planet 's gonna blow . Let 's get outta here ! Frack ! Warm scan positive . Multiple three-passengervehicles . Cylon attack craft . So they spring their trap . Enemy approaching , 90 microns . - Arm weapons . - An opportunity ... to throw down our arms and prove , once and for all ... that peace begets peace and love begets love . Everybody , listen to me !

Enemy closing , 70 microns . Enemy approaching , 55 microns . Serina , take Boxey ! I 'll be back . Let 's go ! Move it out ! Take it easy ! Boxey , where areyou ? Wait ! We can 't leave without Muffit ! - We can 't leave without Muffit . - Let 's go ! Doyou have any idea where these Landrams are coming from ? - I don 't know . - Landrams courtesy ofCommanderAdama . Thirty-five microns and closing . What areyou doing in combat dress ? The rest of Blue Squadron didn 't get to go to the party . They had to letyou go , though , or they 'd been wise ... they didn 't have all the military there . Well , ifyou didn 't go , who were those guys ? Anybody the commander could find in fleet to fill the uniforms . Should 've seen the one that got mine . Enemy closing , 30 microns . Recall all warriors from surface . - Standbytoattack . - Twenty-five microns ... and closing . - I want ladies in that shuttle craft . - Jolly , what 's going on ? The whole squadron 's waiting for orders from the Galactica . Fifteen microns .

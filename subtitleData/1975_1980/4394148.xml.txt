 ( Steel ) You 've seen what can happen , upstairs , this evening . - But we stopped them . - ( Clocks ticking ) Held them . Took the trigger away from them . ( Rob ) The trigger ? Yes , the final ingredient . A certain traditional nursery rhyme spoken in a certain room . Mama ? Daddy ? No pictures . No pictures , Rebecca . # Ring-a-ring o ' roses # A pocketful of posies ... # That 's why we tore it out . - # Ring-a-ring o ' roses ... # - Burned it . # Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down # That 's why Sapphire and I ... # The king has sent his daughter To fetch a pail of water - # Atishoo ! Atishoo ... - ( Ticking stops ) # The wedding bells are ringing The boys and girls are singing # Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down # The birds upon the steeple sit high above the people # Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down - # The cows are in the meadow ... # - ( Rob ) Helen ! # Atishoo ... # 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' - ( Helen ) # We all fall down ... # - Sapphire ... ( Rhythmic throbbing ) ( Helen ) # Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down # Wedding bells are ringing ... # ( Door handle creaking ) # Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down # ( Handle creaks , snaps ) Now ! # Atishoo ... # Hold her ! # Atishoo ! Atishoo ! # ( Sapphire ) Ringing are bells wedding the Singing are girls and boys the - Tishoo-a , tishoo-a ... - Becca ! I said hold her ! ( Faint ghostly voice ) Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down ( Woman ) Ring a ring o ' roses A pocketful of posies Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down ( Man ) ... lying fast asleep Hush , hush ... hush , now ... - The child memorised the rhyme . - ( Sapphire ) Yes . How many more have you learned ? You keep her with you at all times . - ( Steel ) Has the child other dolls ? - Yes . - Downstairs ? - Next floor down , yes . - Find her one from there . - Is that how my parents disappeared ? Yes . And you almost went the same way . Until I say differently this part of the house is out of bounds . - But my mother 's still in there ! - Not any more . I heard her ! I heard her voice ! I did , I heard her ! - ( Sapphire ) No . - I did , in that room . - It wasn 't her . - It was ! Tell me what you saw . - In the room ? - Yes . - I saw lots of things . - People ? Yes , people . And things . But all very quickly . Well , I didn 't actually see her , I saw a shadow of her . ( Rob ) Her voice , that 's all . - That wasn 't her ? - No . Mummy 's coming home ? Not yet . Soon ? Yes , soon . ( Rob ) Well , I don 't trust you . I mean , I can 't trust you , either of you . I don 't know who you are or where you come from . - How can I trust you ? - ( Sapphire ) You have to . First a wall , then a room . You have to trust us . ( Sapphire ) Come on . ( Birds singing ) ( Hammering outside ) ( Hammering continues ) ( Ferry horn ) ( Rhythmic throbbing ) Breakfast ? Um ... I 'm not hungry , thanks . - What is it ? - What ? - What can you see ? - Nothing . Just looking . Oh , Steel wants you - he asked me to tell you . - Yes ? - He 's at the top of the house . - What does he want me for ? - He 's not likely to tell me , is he ? ( Steel ) ' I sent no message . ' No . - Rob , what are you ? - Shh ! Put this on , Helen . - But I don 't want to . - Put it on ! - I 'm eating my breakfast . - Well , you can leave that . Here . - No ! - Shh ! Please , we 've got to be ready . - Ready ? - We 're leaving . The policeman 's coming . Upstairs , I looked out of the window . I saw the ferry crossing the bay , the policeman 's car was on it . - Oh . - He has to be coming here . - Are we going to meet him ? - Yes , so hurry . - Did you tell Sapphire ? - What ? - About the policeman ? - No . - But she 'll be cross . - Come on ! They 're nailing up the door of your room , Helen ! Nailing it . So that no one can get in . And no one can get out . Is that the way to bring Mum and Dad back ? It 's all right . The policeman 's coming , it 's all right , Helen . - Listen . - ( Car horn honks , ferry horn blows ) - ( Steel ) I didn 't even speak to him . - I didn 't think you had . This time it 's worse than the ship . This time it can think , it can reason things out . ( Distorted voices inside ) - What kind of things ? - Method . Listen . ( Distorted voices ) - Like a record that 's stuck . - Yes . It 's not , it 's marking time . ( Car horn honks ) - The boy must 've heard the car . - Yes . I 'm sorry , he just doesn 't trust you . - Does he trust you ? - A little . - You 're the diplomat . - Amongst other things . The one that sweet-talks kids like that , - reassures them . - I manage . So we can get on with the job and win the battle . It 's nearly here . Then the last thing we need right now is someone here who doesn 't know , being helped in turn by someone who doesn 't understand . ( Horn honks ) - Will you handle that policeman ? - No . You do it . Stay there . ( Lock clicks ) ( Car approaching ) ( Lock clicks ) I have to do it . It 's my home . I live here . I have to tell ... someone else . - Are you speaking for both of you ? - Yes . ( Sapphire ) I don 't think you can . Come on , Helen . ( Car door slams ) - It doesn 't matter . - ( Sapphire ) No ? No . I 'm still gonna tell him about my parents , about that room and what I saw . - Do you think he 'll listen to you ? - Yes . - That policeman knows me . - ( Knock at door ) ( Rhythmic throbbing ) Go on , then , try to tell him . Hello , Rob . ( Rhythmic throbbing continues ) ( Knocking ) Hello , Rob . ( Knock at door ) Hello , Rob . ( Knock at door ) - ( Knocking ) - ( Sapphire ) I can keep going . - Hello , Rob . Hello , Rob . - As long as it takes to stop you . So be fair , hm ? I 'm sure the poor man has better things to do . - ( Knocking ) - ( Policeman ) Hello , Rob . ( Knocking and greeting continues repeating ) - ( Policeman ) He ... Oh . - Yes ? Oh , that ... that 's strange . - What is ? - Well , it ... ( Chuckles ) Must 've been the long drive up here . But I could 've sworn I ... Well , I thought that door had already been opened for me once . No . Only after the call I thought I 'd come and see if everything was OK . - Everything 's fine . - Good . - And you are ? - A friend of the family . Here for some ... peace and quiet . Well , that 's all right , then . - But how can you do it ? - I just did it . - But how ? - It doesn 't matter how . Shall I start it all over again ? - Let him get on with his business . - This is his business ! No . Suppose I climb through that window ? I might make you spend the next few hours climbing through and not getting anywhere . - If you can make time go back ... - Who says I can ? You just did it out there . And last night when you kept changing clothes . That was an illusion , they were things I 'd worn in the past . I was projecting an image for you . But just now - that wasn 't an illusion , was it ? - No . - You were making time go back . Yes . Sit down and eat your breakfast . - Why can 't you take it back a day ? - More milk ? Back before yesterday when my parents were here ? I haven 't the power to take time back that far . If I had , don 't you think I 'd have done it ? I suppose so . Imagine a rubber ball - imagine a rubber ball bouncing . The first time the ball hits the ground is the incident , the bouncing that follows is just the echo . Momentum . I 'm able to keep the momentum going longer , that 's all . Just long enough . It helps . ( Door shuts ) ( Car engine starts ) - Does anyone have the power to ? - What ? Well , to take time back further ? - Something does , yes . - Something , not someone ? - Something . - In the corridor ? It can take time backwards or forwards or any way . If it 's allowed to . Only there 's no sense to it . Not sense as we know it . And no purpose , only its own purpose . - What I saw in Helen 's room ... - A fraction , just a peep . But stopping it is our job and that 's all we 're doing here . So please stop fighting us and try to believe in us . We 're all you 've got on your side . First a wall , then a room ... What then ? A house , a road , a village , a town ... What next ? - I need a room to work in . - ( Rob ) What sort of a room ? Do you know which is the youngest room in the house ? - Youngest ? - The last one to be built . My father had a small office built last year . Show me it . Please ? When you said you did a job like this once on a ship ... - Yes . - What happened ? We had to sink the ship . 'For it 's own good , of course . ' 'And it 's not as easy to sink a house . ' Hmm , this is much better . ( Clocks ticking ) And what about this ? 40 , 50 years old ? 1938 . And this . That must be all right . - Six months , most of it . - Most of it ? There are some recycled elements - one 's a good hundred years old . - So nothing 's safe . - No . - Rob ! - ( Rob ) Yes ? - Everything . - What ? I want an empty room . They do clutter their lives , don 't they ? - Sorry . - Get the waste-paper basket . - ( Rob ) What was the trigger ? - What ? When you said time broke through in Helen 's room , you said there was a trigger to make it happen . - That 's right . - What was the trigger on that ship ? Oh , an out-of-date ship 's log . The captain liked nautical heritage . - Oh . - He collected old things from ships . - Not so silly , then , are they ? - Who ? These creatures trying to break through the time fabric . A ship 's log at sea , a nursery rhyme in a child 's room . It sounds to me as if they know what they 're doing . ( Steel ) What 's wrong ? Just something the boy said . It reminded me of something you said . - Me ? - Yes . About methods being used . ( Sarah ) Rob ? Rob ? ! Rob ! And downstairs ... Upstairs ... Upstairs ... And downstairs ... - Rob ! - Mum ! - Mum ? - Just what is going on , Rob ? - Oh , Mum ! - Open this door at once ! Of course ! Oh , it 's nailed up . ( Sarah ) Nailed up ? What have you been doing ? Mum , let me explain ... ( Sarah ) Explain when I 'm out of here ! - Helen will be so pleased ! - Will you open this door ? ! Yes , I 'll fetch Sapphire and Steel . ( Sarah ) There 's no need to fetch them . How do you know them ? ( Sarah ) Well , whoever they are . I don 't know , friends of yours , I suppose . Now , open this door ! - I can 't open it without help . - You can , it 's very simple . ( Sarah ) Just kneel down by the door , just outside the door . Come along , Rob , kneel down by the door ! It 's easy enough to open the door , to let us out . - How ? - Put your face close to the door . Come along , Rob , you can do it ! ( Sarah ) That 's right . That 's fine . Now , then , all you have to do is to say a rhyme . A nursery rhyme . An old one . Any one , providing it 's old . Well , can 't you remember one ? Then just say it , Rob , just say it . Say it ! - I can 't ! - Say it ! I 'm too old to say nursery rhymes ! ( Sarah ) Well then , let 's call it history . - You 're old enough for history . - Yes . A lot of nursery rhymes are history , I taught you that , didn 't I ? - No ! - So say the one in your head ! - Which one ? - The one in there now . - Think of the soldiers . - Soldiers ... ( Sarah ) Climbing the stairs , swords in their hands , searching for people ! - Goosey goosey gander ! - That 's the one ! Where shall I ... Whither shall I wander ? - Upstairs and downstairs ... - ( Footsteps ) In my ... ( Banging ) No ! Sapphire ! Steel !

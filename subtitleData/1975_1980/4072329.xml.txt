 ( Helena ) ' Moonbase Alpha status report , '2,012 days after leaving Earth orbit . 'Dr Helena Russell recording . 'It is three weeks since we sighted the space phenomenon we call Tora . 'Within 24 hours , we shall know whether it is a habitable planet . 'But hopes have been raised before 'and since Commander Koenig doesn 't want to raise hopes again , 'he has ordered the people who know the situation to keep it secret . 'Command Center is off limits to all but a few chosen personnel . ' ( Sighs ) The picture 's gone ! We should know what 's happening . Something is . Command Center 's off limits , screens are blank . We 're approaching a planet . A habitable planet . - I 'm sure of it ! - You 've predicted it before . These things take time to work out . But why is Koenig keeping it from us ? I can guess . But why should we guess ? Let 's find out . .. he 's the craziest guy , he came up to the redhead . - What 's her name ... ? - I don 't know . ( Beeping ) Sure you do ! The redhead ... What , you got something ? Tora , it 's shifting position . Maya , instruments show a change of position . Can that be correct ? Sensors record internal energy that has caused a change in position . ( Koenig ) ' Keep tracking it . ' You know Commander Koenig 's orders . Command Center 's off limits . Well , if those are his orders ... it 's time they were changed . Don 't tell me , I shouldn 't be here , right ? ! Well , I am here . And I want to find out what 's on that screen . You 're off limits , Sanderson ! Eva , open the big screen . Shut the doors . ( Sanderson ) Like I said - a planet ! But is it habitable ? We 'll need another astro-prediction . Get prepared . Eva , turn off the computers . Concentrate . Concentrate . Total ... concentration . ( All ) Total ... concentration . Total ... concentration . Total ... concentration . - It can 't be ! - It is . We 've got to get back immediately . Eagle Four to Moonbase Alpha . 'Koenig to Command Center . Respond ! ' - .. with trees and grass ... - ' Command Center , do you read me ? 'Calibration shows Tora and Moonbase Alpha on a direct collision course ! - ' Red Alert ! ' - I see a habitable planet ... 'Repeat - Red Alert ! ' and grass ! It 's a habitable planet ! The prediction was right - it 's a habitable planet ! Come on . What happened ? It 's Sanderson . He 's in there . ( Shouting from inside ) Sanderson ! My prediction was right ! Sanderson ! Stand back . A habitable planet ! Trees and grass ! The astro-prediction was right ! It 's a habitable planet ! It 's a ... ! Get a medical team here right away ! ( Beeping ) - How is she ? - She 'll be fine . ( Groaning ) - Helena ... What is it ? - Autohypnosis . As far as I 'm concerned , it 's criminal . It 's green sickness . You know the symptoms . - Is mutiny one of the symptoms ? - It could be . - I have to take responsibility . - Responsibility for what ? Mutiny ? Surface Exploration Units like Sanderson 's have it rougher than us . Living out there alone having nothing to look at but bare rock for a month - they 're paying the price . I should have seen it coming . None of the other teams reacted this way . Sanderson 's team has done more and stayed out longer , and the other teams are beginning to show signs . I 'll have to limit surface exploration to 15 days at a time . All right . Confine Sanderson and his team to Medical . Under guard ! ( Koenig ) What 've we got ? Internal energy ... electrical storms ... rain , sleet ... an atmosphere . A vast weather belt , in fact . Could we travel through it ? ( Maya ) If it doesn 't clog our recycling systems . There may be a solid centre . Which could mean a planet . Sanderson 's habitable planet ? Let 's hope Maya 's instruments are wrong . If Tora 's got a hard core and we 're on a collision course , God help us . ( Koenig ) Alan , prepare an Eagle . - Right . - Maya , come with me . ( Helena ) You have a condition we 've termed " green sickness . " That 's a convenient fiction , a neat way to cover Koenig 's lies ! Listen to me . You were one of the first people assigned to Alpha and psychological pressures have built up in you . I don 't buy that , Doctor . You want to marry . Want children . Your life 's slipping away . - And the others ? - They follow your leadership . You 're the best exploration team leader that we have . You 've pulled them all out of trouble ... a hundred times . - They rely on you . - ( Ringing ) But you 're failing them now , Greg ! - You 're behaving irrationally ! - I 'm going to see Koenig ! You can 't . You 're confined here . - Who 's confining me ? - Security ! - ' Sanderson 's on his way ! ' - ( Door opens ) - Hold it , Sanderson . - Where 's Koenig ? Where is he ? Right here ! You were confined to Medical . Sure , so no one hears what I have to say about the new planet . There is no new planet . So far , it 's just a weather belt until we explore it and maybe find something . And when you find it ? IF we find it , I 'll determine if it 's habitable . There IS a habitable planet , but you 'll come back denying it ! Sanderson , why would I do that ? Because you can 't stand the thought of us having a normal life ! In a normal life , we 'd make our own decisions , have children , vote . And there 'd be no place for Commander Koenig 's dictatorship . That 's why you won 't tell us . If there 's a planet out there , everyone on Alpha will be told . Some people may buy that , but I don 't ! Once you 're up there , how can we be sure what the computer 's saying ? All right . All right . Every piece of data from Tora will be processed here through computer . So everyone on Alpha will see as it happens on their screens . - How does that suit you ? - That I 'll buy . Put that Eagle on the pad ready for lift-off . Right . Prepare Eagle One for lift-off . - ( Man ) ' Right . ' - Stand up ! So you 're beating up the guards now ? - What is the matter with you ? - He 's sick , Tony ! Sick ? No ! I just see clearer than the rest of you . Oh , yeah ( ? ) Well , all you 'll see from now on will be via the monitors of the Restriction Area . Get him out ! He needs treatment , Tony . I want him back in Medical . OK , but I want him constantly under guard . And properly this time ! Take him away ! ( Koenig ) ' Eagle One to Alpha , on course for Tora . ' What we 're dealing with here is an extreme manifestation of tension . As stress builds it results in disorientation and hallucination . - As in my case ? - Yes . No , " Doctor " ! Let 's complete the treatment and then see if you 're so certain . - What about Eva ? - Oh , she 's free to go . She 's not hallucinating . She 's in love . You heard what Dr Russell said - you 're free to go . So go . I 'll be in my quarters . ( Beep ) Medical emergency . Recycling plants one and two . ( Tony ) ' What 's happening , Helena ? ' I 'll let you know as soon as I find out . George ? ( Groans ) ( Groans ) - Range ? - Range counter seven . How far in do you want to go ? Not so far in that we can 't pull out at the first sign of gravitation . Got a reading ? Nothing to indicate a planet , but there could be anything in the centre of all that . All right , let 's hook up to main computer . Ready on main computer ? Ready to receive data . 'No gravitational trace . Clear to approach range three . ' Range two . What have you got , San ? First atmospheric indications - high density , high carbon dioxide content , unbreathable . 'Are we still clear on gravitational pull ? ' Getting a slight tremor here . Could be atmospheric vibration or the beginning of a gravity pull . Watch it , John , you could get sucked in . 'I 'm coming into range Confirm negative indications . 'We turn back at confirmation of a gravity pull . ' We 've got to make him go all the way ! Make him find that planet . - But the atmosphere 's unbreathable . - Of course it is ! At the outer limits , it 's like Earth . The tremor 's gone , Maya . Looks like you 're clear to go in . ( Beeping ) Zero gravity ? I can 't believe it . Something 's wrong . Let me switch to the onboard computer . Everyone will think we 're holding back information . We stay with main computer . Get Tony . 'You 're clear to approach , John . Zero gravity . Repeat , zero gravity . ' That 's impossible . Get him back . Tony , run a systems check . - You must be wrong ! - ' OK . ' Approaching range one . Circuit one - OK . Circuit two - OK . Powerlines one through to 10 - OK . Circuit three - malfunction ! 'Computer malfunction . Turn back ! ' 'Turn back , John ! Turn back ! ' It 's too late ! Now you 'll have to find that planet , Commander ! ( Tony ) ' Turn back , Eagle One . Do you read me ? ' ( Maya ) Commander , it 's the planet ! Come in , John Maya ! Respond , please ! Moonbase Alpha to Eagle One . Moonbase Alpha to Eagle One . Come in , please ! ( Coughing ) Maya , are you all right ? ( Coughing ) Yeah . Get the helmets ! They 're both ... damaged . Let 's get out of here , seal this off . Come on ! - Still operational ? - I ... think ... so . We 'd better check the oxygen . Our oxygen recycling plant is less than five per cent effective - insufficient to maintain life . 'John , Maya - are you receiving me ? ' Yes , Tony . 'Command Center to Eagle One . Are you receiving me ? ' Transmission system 's not functioning . - No response ? - No , nothing . I have a reading on the damage . Pressure hull pierced , transmission silenced , oxygen recycler damaged . Engines and guidance systems intact . Intact ? Alan , could you pull them out on the remote control ? I 'll give it a try . ( Beeping ) Yeah ? 'Security . We 've checked levels C , D , B. No sign of Sanderson . ' - How about level A ? - ' That was cleared first . ' Start again from square one . I want Sanderson found ! Ah ! I 'm getting feedback from Eagle One . I 'm firing forward thrusters . They 've got us on automatic ! They 're trying to get us out . Come on , baby ! Come on ! It 's a three-hour flight back . We haven 't got enough oxygen ! Sit down . Vegetation will create oxygen ! Lift-off ! We have lift-off ! But a plant needs the sun for the photosynthesis process , to can turn carbon dioxide into oxygen . Or something that fakes the sun , like a bright light . Ready , launch pad one . Damaged Eagle . Alert rescue units . Emergency , fire and decontamination units to Eagle hanger bay one ! Stretcher unit to Eagle hanger bay one ! 'Surgical team to Medical Center immediately . ' OK , San , bring down the launch pad . Command Center to launch area . Lower Eagle One to launch bay . What is it ? Where did all this vegetation come from ? Maya ! Maya ? - Are you all right ? - Yes . - What happened ? - It 's oxygen starvation , Helena . The atmosphere couldn 't support us . With oxygen deprivation we can tell fast if there 's been brain damage . He wakes up wondering what the worried faces are worrying about . John ? Do you hear me ? John , do you know who I am ? I never saw you before in my life . Dr Russell . That 'll do . While we were concentrating on you , Sanderson sabotaged the main computer . - Where is he ? - In travel tube D. If we try to get near , he 'll mow us down . San , get me travel tube four , section D. Sanderson , listen to me ! 'If you hear me , let me know . We have no time to lose . - ' We 're on a collision course . ' - So there 's a planet ? 'Yes , but in the earliest stages of formation . ' We 've arrived 50 million years too early . ( Sanderson ) ' You 're lying . ' It 's not habitable , just a weather belt ! - " Just a weather belt " ( ? ) - ' With a core of dust . ' we 've been on your team from the beginning . You 've gotten us out of some tight spots . - What are you saying ? - What we both feel , Sanderson . On the moon we 'd never question your judgement . Plenty of times it 's the only way we 've stayed alive . - But ? - But ... now we 're just not so sure . The Commander may be telling the truth . He 's lying ! He 's just trying to make us give up ! On our present course , we 'll be drawn into orbit round Tora . 'There is no orbit ! We 'll be swallowed by a swamp of dust ! ' No ! There is a habitable planet . The prediction says so ! We 've got to get through to him in time . - How ? - Maya , how long do we have ? ( Computer beeping ) On our present course , we 'll collide in eight hours . Eight hours . Tony , is there any way we can alter Tora 's trajectory ? No , we just don 't have the megatons . - OK . Then we go round it . - Yeah , alter the moon 's course . The way this whole thing started . When the nuclear waste blew up . You 'll trigger the atomic waste ? No , some of it . We 'll create an explosion to shift the moon a few degrees . That could work . If we had an atomic trigger and some luck ! Maya , get me a damage forecast on a sudden two-degree shift . Anticipate severe damage in all sections . High fire risk . And people ? Forecast zero survival rate . Attention Moonbase personnel . 'We are faced with the huge risk of blasting the moon out of its course . 'To minimise the risk , I am ordering immediate evacuation . ' - Just to stay in command ! - Suppose he 's telling the truth ? Trust me , like you trusted me before . Concentrate ! Concentrate . Concentrate . ( All ) Total ... concentration . Total ... concentration . We 'd better take that along to be on the safe side . Maya ? - ( Bleeping ) - Yes , Helena ? 'Is it really worth taking all this stuff with us ? ' If we can 't shift the Moon 's course , those Eagles will be our home . 'How long are we gonna survive on a fleet of Eagles ? 'We 'll be at each other 's throats . ' A lot of Alphans said the same when we split from Earth . 'If the chips are on the table , we 're still in the game . ' Right on . 'All essential equipment 's onboard . 'Boarding 's complete , apart from pads six and nine . 'Ready for lift-off in nine minutes . ' - Sanderson and the others ? - ' Still in the travel tube . ' Sanderson , you know the danger of staying here when we trigger the waste dumps . This is your last chance . You can still reach a boarding station and be evacuated . Respond , Sanderson ! 'It 's the last chance for all of you ! 'Sanderson , listen to me ! 'Sanderson ! Eva ! Cernik ! Stevens ! 'This is your last chance ! ' He won 't do it ! He 'll never trigger the waste pits while we 're here . Suppose you 're wrong about this habitable planet ? I 'm not wrong . Just suppose , for a moment , Koenig is telling the truth . To save Moonbase he 'll have to trigger the atomic waste , whether we 're here or not . I have information , Eva . I have the predictions . For the sake of every Alphan , we must go through with this . Cernik ! Stevens ! Dr Russell diagnoses a sickness . She says we all have it . A sickness where our wish for the green planet is so strong , our decisions are distorted . Do you believe that ... or me ? Sanderson , don 't you see ? We 're just not sure any more . After all we 've faced together , suddenly you 're not sure any more ! But this is different . It 's got to be different . How " different ? " You talk about the new planet . You talk about freedom from John Koenig 's command . I say let 's start now , the four of us . Let 's vote on what we do . - Vote ? - Why not ? Koenig 's the dictator , not you . - Eva ? - I think we should vote . All right . All those in favour of evacuation ? I 'm sorry . Don 't you understand that we have a responsibility to the others ? We just took a vote ! Do you abide by it ? Koenig ! We 're coming out . Good . The last Eagle lifts off in five minutes . Evacuation complete . Two hours 23 minutes to collision . Let 's get in position . 'John - trouble ! I checked the boarding lists . 'Sanderson 's still on Moonbase . ' ( Tony ) ' Sanderson , there are two hours 20 minutes to collision point ! ' To orbit , understand ? ! And then we use the transporters to transfer everyone to the new planet . We 'll be swallowed by dust and toxic gases . - Sanderson , I 'm coming down . - There 's no time ! Stay there . Make one move to bring that transporter down and Maya won 't be Maya any more ! Get on that computer . I want to know when we go into orbit . If Tora 's atmosphere gets in our air will be lethal . The air is clear on Tora ! Fresh and ... pure ... and there 's water . 'Eva , you 've got to persuade him . It 's their only chance . ' 'Put the gun away , Greg . Please . 'You were wrong . We were all wrong . 'Cernik , Stevens , all of us . ' You 'll thank me for holding out against them . We 'll walk on that planet breathing real air , not recycled survival gases ! Walking on grass , by trees , streams . - The prediction ! - ' It 's wrong , Greg ! 'Dr Russell is right . It 's an hallucination , a mirage . ' You , too , Eva . You 've gone over to Koenig 's side . You know why he 's doing it ! He has to , to keep us on this barren rock ! 'You 're wrong , Greg , it 's all in your mind ! Greg ... please do what the Commander wants . Before all this happened you believed in him . Believe in him now ! 'Believe in him ? I 've never believed in him ! ' - Tony , - ' Yeah' Eva can 't get through to him . I 'm going down . 'No , hold your position . That 's an order . ' He 's lied to us all along and he 's still lying now ! And for that he 's got to die ! Maya , get the gun ! ( Koenig ) Fire ! Why didn 't you fire ? I couldn 't . It was jammed on kill . We 've got less than two hours to set the atomic trigger . Well , there they are , the nuclear waste silos . Each of those shafts is 10,000 feet deep and capped with concrete . We 'll have to blast one of those concrete caps away , to lower the atomic trigger . - ETA to collision point ? - 57 minutes . Magnify . What is that thing ? ( Helena ) I don 't know . - Magnify , damn it ! - I am trying ! Alan , there 's something on the surface . Can you identify it from your position ? - ' Can you give me any co-ordinates ? ' - I 've got it ! ( Helena ) It 's a moon buggy ! It 's Sanderson ! John , Sanderson 's down there waiting for you ! Do you read me ? Sanderson is waiting for you . He is amongst the rocks , but I cannot pinpoint him from here . - Get that , John ? - Yeah , Tony , got it . Thanks . - How 're we doing ? - OK . ( Helena ) It 's gonna be hard to pick him out . ( Carter ) ' We shouldn 't be up here away from the action . ' I know how you feel . We can 't risk anybody else . - ' Sanderson is down there . ' - I know that ! If and when we pinpoint him , we 'll go down after him . - Setting ? - ( Koenig ) 18 minutes . Is that enough time ? That 's all the time we 've got . Four minutes to blast away the cap , two minutes to attach this device to the silo and get back here and 12 minutes to blast ourselves as far away from here as we can get . - Good luck . - I 'll need it . No sign of him . He 's down there somewhere . ( Koenig ) ' I 'm at the silo now . ' ( Maya ) We have no visual of Sanderson . Continuing to scan . ( Tony ) ' Eagle Three to Eagle Six . Any movement in area three , Alan ? ' ( Carter ) ' Eagle Six . Nothing so far , Tony . 'Will continue searching . ' - ' Can you see anything , Maya ? ' - ' Nothing , Tony . ' - ' Sweep co-ordinate 2 : 4 . ' - ' Right . ' ( Koenig ) ' Connecting charges now . ' ( Tony ) ' Keep an eye out , John . Sanderson 's around somewhere . ' ( Koenig ) ' All clear , Tony . ' Aerial rigged for detonation . ( Carter ) ' Eagle Six to Eagle Three , no sign of Sanderson . 'Recheck your area , Tony . ' ( Tony ) ' Maya , three o 'clock ! 'Maya ? Maya , can you hear me ? 'John , Eagle Two 's been hit . I 've lost contact with Maya . ' Tony , keep trying . OK , the cap 's blown . Going in to lay the atomic trigger now . ( Tony ) ' Watch Sanderson . ' ( Carter ) ' John , look out ! ' ( Tony ) ' Eagle Two , come in ! Come in , please , Maya ! 'It 's Tony . Can you hear me ? What 's the damage ? ' ( Sanderson groans ) ( Tony ) ' Maya , answer me ! Eagle Two , do you read me ? 'Maya , come in , please ! ' Atomic trigger in position . ( Groans ) ( Tony ) ' Are you all right ? ' ( Groans ) ( Tony ) ' You 're running out of time ! ' ( Ticking ) ( Screams ) ( Tony ) ' John , get out of there ! ' - ' John , are you OK ? ' - OK , Tony . What 's the damage on Eagle Two ? ( Carter ) ' No report . We can 't raise Maya . - ' Get out of there ! ' - OK . I 'm on my way . ( Tony ) ' This is Eagle Six calling Eagle Two . 'Come in , Eagle Two . 'Maya , can you hear me ? 'Maya , this is Tony . Answer me ! Come in , Maya . 'Eagle Two , come in , please ! ' ( Koenig ) Maya ! Maya ! Maya ! - ' How is she , John ? ' - Don 't know yet , Tony . Maya ! Open up ! Maya ! Maya ! The door 's jammed . Open on manual ! I 'm trapped ! - We 've got four minutes , Maya ! - I can 't reach the controls ! Four minutes . They 're not going to make it . ( Ticking ) John , lean on it ! The moon has changed course . We 're not on collision course . - What do you think ? - Looks good . I 've never seen so many bored people ! - Doctor , how much longer ? - Another hour and a half . - ( Groans ) - Oh , come on . It 's not bad . They 're quite nice , Particularly if you have an eye for nature . As I say , if you have an eye for nature . - Will your system work ? - The principle 's valid . Saturation equals boredom . You show ' em trees and meadows , until they can 't stand it , right ? Well , as you said , if you like nature , Doctor . So I did ! ( Carter ) You said choose something from the picture library . That is what I call choice ! Oh , mother ! ( Carter ) My mother was never like that !

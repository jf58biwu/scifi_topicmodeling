 Avalanche ! I have no control over the use of my creations ! - No responsibility ! - Then who does ? Hold on ! They 're using the intakes ! Fire . 'There are those who believe 'that life here 'began out there , 'far across the universe , 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans . 'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens . ' ( Adama ) ' ln part one of Gun On Ice Planet Zero ... ' l just have the feeling that we 're being carefully manoeuvred . We 're being herded into this safe passage ahead . ( Centurion ) Pump system to speed . I 'm picking up a flare . A brilliant bead of light , like an eclipse . I 'm going to check it out . Locked on target . Fire . ( Starbuck ) ' We 're under attack . ' Battle stations ! Flight officer ! ( Alarm ) Starbuck , they 're forcing me down . - ls it something serious ? - No . We 're just handing the fleet over to a bunch of criminals . There 's not much difference between you and your fellow convicts and us . We are all live for the promise of freedom and fear the same death . Cylons . We 're going down ! Search for wreckage . Leave no survivors . They 're clones . You came to destroy the Ravashol pulsar . - Ravashol ? - He is the Father Creator . - Cylon patrol . - Everybody down . ( Adama ) ' And now , the exciting conclusion of Gun On Ice Planet Zero . ' The way is clear now . So you 're not turning us in to the Cylons . No , we hate the Cylons . We are Theta-class life forms , considered by the Cylons to be subhuman . We were created for slave labour . Most of our brothers and sisters are still slaves . But you revolted . - Evidently we are not perfect . - No . Just human . Will you help us destroy the pulsar ? First we must get into the village . Come . ( Muffit barking ) This is the entrance to our underground city . ( Distant chatter ) This leads to the base of the research station . We must get to the top of that mountain . - There is one who can help . - Who ? Father Creator - Ravashol . - He 's here ? In the village ? - He lives at the base of Mount Hekla . - You 'll take me to him ? - To free my people ? Yes . But first I 'll take your people to safety . The probe that landed on the planet 's surface - it was destroyed ? Not exactly . - Not exactly ? - Control yourself , my friend . You 'll blow a circuit , or I believe you call it a blood vessel . Quite flimsy compared to ... I do not need a lesson in anatomy . Where are our fighters ? Close to the point of no return . Still hectares from the Galactica . Have them attack the Galactica . But they will not have enough fuel to return . That 's suicide . - They 're machines ! - We are all machines . Even you , of a sort . With a probe on the surface and possible survivors , I must push the Galactica forward . Even if they were human pilots , I would give the same order . Yes , I believe you would . By your command . ( Screams ) - Cylons are searching the village . - Take the others and hide them . - But where ? - With the children . - Hear that , Muffit ? There are children ! - ( Barks ) - Children ? - We were thought to be sterile . It was a Cylon mandate to maintain the purity of the Theta life form . - But we have been bearing children . - And hiding them ? Yes . Father Creator , please do not call for help . You are not permitted here . Only planners . Father Creator , we are in need of your help . - You 're one of the 5 series . - Yes . Series 5 , Culture 9 . You are not one of mine . You 're a human . Flight Captain Apollo from the Battlestar Galactica . The Galactica is a vessel of war . I have no use for war or violence . You have a strange way of showing it . What 's that on the mountain , a weapon of peace ? It is an energy lens system to transmit intelligence across the galaxy . Your energy lens system has fried two of my fighters and is holding the Colonial fleet at bay until the Cylons can destroy it . lmpossible ! My system is maintained by Series 5 Theta life forms . With all reverence , they are whipped if they come near the pulsar . You are wrong ! I make adjustments , repairs , I transmit . My helpers are Series 5 ! Right now your pulsar is manned by Cylons as a weapon of war . A temporary misuse . A temporary abuse . So you know how it 's being used ! I have no control over the use of my creations ! - No responsibility ! - Then who does ? ( Beep ) 'Dr Ravashol , permission to enter . ' Cylons ! Behind the research stacks , in the equipment cases . Hide him ! Enter . Why did you keep us waiting ? Would you like me to ruin my work ? These are delicate compounds . - Search . - What do you think you 're doing ? The garrison commander will hear of this . - We have orders to search . - We 'll see about that . This is Dr Ravashol. I want to speak to the command Centurion . 'Dr Ravashol . ' Why is my work being disrupted ? There is a patrol here . We are searching for humans . I know nothing about humans . Please order your Centurions to go so I may continue my work . Only planners are permitted to visit you . He 's here because I need a strong back to move some equipment . Leave Dr Ravashol to his research . Punish the worker clone . He 's here at my orders ! ( Woman ) Cylons ! Cylons ! Help ! - This is our chance to go . - We 've more chance on the mountain . Why couldn 't you leave us alone ? If you hadn 't come , all would be peaceful ! We had no choice . The Cylons forced us here . They are out to exterminate every human in the universe . - Even you will go . - They let me live . They understand my work . You want to destroy everything I 've created . Before you came , everything was in its place . - Planners to think , workers to work . - l 've got news for you . Your workers are thinking and breeding . - lmpossible . - Tell that to the children they 've hidden . Children ? If you won 't help me to save the lives in the fleet , do it for the Thetas . In a sense , they 're all your children . We 've picked up a Cylon fighter squadron . - How many ? - An attack phalanx . - They 're beginning to press . - Battle stations . - Order Blue Squadron to patrol the rear . - ( Alarm ) ( Rigel ) ' Vector coordinates coded and transferred . 'Launch Bay Alpha , stand by to launch fighter patrol . 'Launch when ready . 'Enemy approaching . 100 microns and closing . ' - Protect the freighters . - Blue Leader , engage . Have our fighters engaged the Galactica ? Yes . But they will not have enough fuel to return . Break off the attack . Baltar , I believe my sound sensor mishears you . I said break off the attack ! It will force Adama to believe ... that we are even closer than we are in actuality . Very clever . A little hard on our troops but very clever . By your command . Why are they withdrawing ? Secure quarters . They 'll be back in packs like wild animals . How long until the landing party completes its mission ? irrelevant . We must move forward in exactly ... 420 centons , whether they 're successful or not . There are two chambers , one housing the pulsar , the other a small garrison . The only way to destroy it is to jam or reverse the main pump . It 's not easy but it can be done . Here , here and here . Quick , we must hide these humans . ( Yapping ) He won 't hurt you ! He 's just a daggit ! Where 's Thane ? I don 't know , maybe he got separated . He 's been looking for a chance to make a break . - We 'd better go find him . - Wait . Let us do it . As you can see , strangers are easy to single out here . Come . What is your purpose here ? Just visiting . How many of you are there ? I travel alone . I 've always been a little antisocial . - You are from the Galactica . - Never heard of it . The Cylons have captured one of your party . - l 'll go . - You 're not going anywhere . I need you to scale the mountain . Take me to where they have Thane . - The Cylons will recognise you . - Not if I 'm dressed like a Theta . - All this risk for one man ? - He might betray us . Are you sure it 's Thane you want to save and not the other one ? Who else are you looking for ? It 's a pilot I lost . Just a kid , really . His name 's Cree . If he survived , the Cylons will have him . For his sake , I hope he didn 't . Take him to a cold cell . I will examine his cortex later . No ! No ! No ! How many combat ships in the fleet ? Tough question . There 's so many . How many ? Starbuck ! - Where 's Apollo ? - He is with Ravashol . - ls he safe ? - He is in hiding . Can Ravashol be trusted ? He saved Ser 5-9 from the Cylons . - Looks like they caught you . - Ravashol lied to save me . I prefer being whipped to being killed . In my inner pocket there 's a tape coder . The information you want is recorded in it . Just press that button . We 'd better get back . That 's no way to greet a fellow warrior . I left you in charge . What happened ? Thane 's dead . - But he didn 't betray us . - We got a problem . - Ravashol says ... - Father Creator helped you ? Yes . He says our only chance is a simultaneous attack . One garrison is stationed outside the pulsar , the other on the gun . You 're in charge of taking the garrison . - l won 't let you down . - l 'm counting on it . - Let 's set our timepieces at 200 centons . - Got it . We 'll reach the top and start our attack in exactly 200 centons . The Galactica will be moving forward after that . - For all our sakes , don 't be late . - l 'll be there . One of the clones told me the Cylon fighters are located at the top of the mountain , just behind the pulsar emplacement . When we get there , we grab one ! And go where ? How long before Galactica hunts us down ? The Galactica is the hunted . Adama won 't waste a squadron hunting down three ex-convicts . He knows that ! Why are your sympathies with those who chained you ? The Galactica and the entire fleet are finished . They will be if we don 't knock out that pulsar . Right . They 'll all be destroyed and we 'll be free ! We can find another planet . Starlos isn 't far . We can pick up food and water and fuel . Are you with us , or are you going to turn your back on freedom again ? I could not shoot down a Colonial warrior . Oh , yes , I know - the code , the bloodline . And for all your compassion , they chained you like an animal ! Now is your chance ! Our chance . One last time , my husband . Are you with us ? I 'm with you . Good news . Some of our fighters may have enough fuel to rendezvous with us . Well , at least 30 % . Good . Have them re-engage the Galactica . But Baltar , they just disengaged . Yes ! It will drive Adama crazy . - He 's not the only one . - You said something ? By your command . ( Rigel ) Enemy closing . 10 microns . - ( Adama ) General quarters . - Closing in , five microns . ( Rigel ) Blue Squadron up . Launch when ready . Activate the laser turrets . ( Radio chatter ) Cylon attacking fighters have retreated but Cylon battlestars are entering the quadrant . Our time is up , Colonel . Flank speed ahead ! We 're going right through . By your command . 'Our base ships have arrived and are closing on the Galactica . 'What is the status of the pulsar ? ' - Fully operative . - ' initiate random firing . 'Sweep the entire corridor . Begin at once . ' By your command . Notify summit station . Random sweeps covering the corridor . ( Alarm blaring ) Lens system aligned . Pulsar ready to fire . Commence firing . ( Adama ) My God . ( Operator ) Yes , I read you . Fire . Avalanche ! ( Groaning ) That 's one I owe you . ( Pulsar firing ) His leg - he 'll never make it to the top of the mountain . - Can you get him down ? - l think so . - Do it ! - What about the pulsar ? We 'll take it from here . Let 's go ! We 've only got 80 centons left ! Fire . ( Omega ) We 're getting within range . The expedition must have failed . They still have 70 centons . Fire . ( Rigel ) lt 's closing . 68 centons . If we 're gonna go ... it 's got to be now ! ( Pulsar firing ) I 'm with you . There 's nowhere you can go , Wolfe ! There 's a squadron of Cylon fighters the other side of the hill . We 're getting off this piece of ice . There isn 't time ! The Galactica 's passing through the quadrant ! - We 've got to silence that gun ! - l don 't care about the Galactica . The Galactica is the only ship in the galaxy that can protect you . Without us you 're finished ! I don 't think you realise who is finished here . The Cylons won 't rest until we 're all dead . Don 't worry , Captain , we 're gonna make it . - To where ? - Well , now ... that isn 't really going to matter ... to you . Wolfe ! ( Apollo ) Don 't shoot ! He 'll never make it . He 's not getting away , he 's as good as dead . We 've got to go with him . It 's our only chance . We 're here on a mission - a mission to save the last remains of a once-civilised race . And we 're going to do it ! You understand that ? This mission goes through . - ( Pulsar fires ) - Let 's get moving . Time is running out . I 'm putting you in charge . Get us into that pulsar station . We 've only got 62 centons . We 're approaching Cylon scanning range . They 'll have a fix on us at any moment . Commander ... I suggest we let all the ships move at maximum speed . We jeopardise the fleet if we maintain the speed of the slowest ship . Execute . Galactica to all ships . Accelerate to maximum possible speed . lncrease interval spacing . And good luck . Where is the Galactica ? 60 centons and closing . 50 centons and closing . Maintain random firing . Fire . Hard to starboard . 42 centons. I 'll be with you as fast as I can . - Where you going ? - To settle a debt . - You 're going to what ? - Don 't wait more than 20 centons . This is the intake for the cooling system . Laser 's inside . We don 't have enough solenite to blow it all up . Ravashol said the key element is the energy exchange pump . If we can wreck it , the gun will overload and blow itself up . Let 's take a look . We 've only got 35 centons to go . I hope Starbuck 's on schedule . The emergency escape hatch . The cold cells where the Cylons hold prisoners are directly below . - There 'll be guards . - lt 'll take ' em by surprise . Nobody breaks into prison . - Starbuck ! - Can you walk ? - l can try . - Let 's go . - Where is the Galactica ? - 30 centons and closing . Fire . - Hard to port . - Helm hard to port . - That was close . - Hard to starboard . Commander , we have to turn back . We 'll never make it . ( Rigel ) 27 centons and closing . Hold on ! They 're using the intakes ! ( Wind rushing ) Let 's go ! Hurry up , we 've only got 25 centons . Come on. ln here . Wait . Listen ... - You risked your life to save his . - Seemed like a good trade then . You are very courageous . I don 't wish to betray my people but ... But what ? - They will help you destroy the Cylons . - l know . They will not allow you to destroy the pulsar . How will they stop us ? Apollo and the others are setting the charges . I do not know how , only that they will - by whatever means . Let 's talk to your people . That 's the firing station in the middle . It controls the energy pump . - ls that the target ? - Blow that and it overloads . It 'll blow off the top of the mountain . 20 centons . Fire . - Increase spacing between ships . - Yes , sir . Cylon base stars , quadrant Epsilon . Closing rapidly . There 's your answer , Colonel . We can 't turn back . We must move forward . We 'll get through . We must get through . We 'll help you destroy the garrison . The pulsar weapon belongs to us . Keep that gun and the Galactica is blown out of the sky . When news of our revolt reaches a Cylon outpost or base ship , they will come here in their fighters to destroy us . You will have gone . We will be here alone and defenceless unless we have the pulsar to repel them . Can 't you hear it ? ( Pulsar firing ) The Galactica is the last Colonial battlestar . The fate of an entire race depends on it ! - That is not our concern . - But it is mine . ( Gasps ) I am a member of that race that is fleeing the Cylon tyranny . Father Creator . It is for our protection that I speak . We will not be subjugated again by machines . - We are not perfect ... - But you are human . More human than I had anticipated . I shall review my notes to see where l went wrong . Those are your brothers out there in space . We have to help them . Destroy the pulsar . I will protect you . - ( Apollo ) Eight centons to go . - We go now or not at all . All the way or not at all . - We are with you . - ( All ) Let 's go . How will you protect them ? I didn 't give the Cylons everything I 've created . Five centons . You take the three at the firing station , I 'll take the two at the door . For the glory of Caprica . For once in your life don 't be late , Starbuck . Four centons and closing . Fire . Heads up . Three centons and closing . ( Rigel ) Commander , we 'll be in range in one centon . Ready ? Now ! Let 's go ! We 're almost out of time ! Croft ! Fire . That was too close . Why haven 't they stopped it ? - The garrison ? - Wiped out . You go ahead. I 'll get Croft . Croft , we 've only got a few microns left . Why would she do that ? Why would she save my life ? Let 's go . Fire . 45 microns and closing . 40 microns , 39 ... What if the blast cuts the cable ? We 'll find out . 33 , 32 , 31 , 30 microns . Time to leave , kids . Let 's go ! - My father ! - l 'm taking you to him , kid . ( Rigel ) 1 4 , 13 ... ( Centurion ) Ten ... ( Rigel ) Nine ... Eight , seven , six , five , four , three ... ( Rigel ) Two ... ( Centurion ) One . Fire . Commander , we 've picked up an explosion on the surface ! A big one ! Can you read position ? The mountain ! They 've done it . They 've done it ! ( Cheering ) - Secure quarters ! - Normal operations . Send out a rescue unit with full fighter escort . Aye aye , sir . Baltar , I bring grave news . - lt cannot be . - l 'm afraid it can . A handful of humans successfully destroyed the Ravashol pulsar . Despite all of your garrisons and squadrons and the biggest weapon in the universe ? But the strategy was yours , Baltar . I recommend we come up with a solid front to explain this debacle to the imperious Leader . Very well . But I will yet have the last laugh on Adama , mark my words . Don 't I always , Baltar ? I haven 't seen emotion in a long time . It 's good to see it again . - The Cylons will be back . - We 'll take care of them . You may have trouble with your children , they 're getting more and more human . I 'm glad . Peace be with you . May you get to where you 're going . Peace be with you , Father Creator . - Let 's go home ! - ( Man ) Goodbye ! Good luck ! Let 's go home ! Let 's go , Starbuck . Captain , wait . This is the chance of a lifetime . Three versions of the same beautiful woman . - lmagine the possibilities . - l can . - You can ? - Yeah . Another time . Captain ... Bye . Well , you win one , lose one . I just lost all three .

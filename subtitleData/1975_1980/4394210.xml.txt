 - It 's impossible . - There 's no doubt . No fire ? - Steel ? - None . - Steel ? - The room was destroyed . Not now , Felix ! - Not even a trace ? - Steel ! Steel ... June the 22nd . 1930 . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' No fire . There never was , this room is undamaged . - Then the report was wrong . - Someone could 've lied . I wonder what Felix was trying to tell us ? Where are Emma and Felicity ? In their rooms ? - But not asleep yet . - Is Mr McDee still in his lab ? Yes . He 'll be working late and so shall I. I 've never seen that one before . Now the events of that night take place as before . - With one exception . - The death of McDee . He survives and history changes . Sir , I ... Sorry . It 's deductible . Belongs there . - Go to bed . - I envy him . - What ? - Mr McDee . He doesn 't need much sleep . He 'll be able to get all the sleep he wants after tomorrow . How very gratifying . - Do you know who that is ? - Greville . Well , yes and no . In 1930 there were two Grevilles , father and son . - Good night , sir . - Good night . - That 's the father . - And young Greville ? He 's asleep in his cot in the servants quarters . - Can I get you anything , sir ? - No , thank you . - Oh , just ... - I 'll put the kettle on now . Mullrine lied to the newspaper . He killed George McDee and covered it up . Or ... Or the computer lied to us . Remember what you read on that screen . It changed the word to trick us . Well , someone is going to kill McDee . We have to make sure the murder takes place exactly as it did before . - What is it ? ! - Shh ! You didn 't come , George . - I waited over an hour for you . - Leave me alone , Emma ! What 's the matter ? Getting bored with me ? - I 'm working ! - But you promised . - Just go ! - Not until I have your answer . Have you stopped loving me ? Not now ! Not now ! - You 've no time for me ? - I couldn 't leave this ! I waited patiently for you , George . - You promised you 'd come . - Do you not understand , woman ? ! Can you not get it through your head ? I 'm about to achieve everything I 've ever dreamed of ! - It 'll make history ! - I don 't care for history . - Please , leave me ! - No . Get out ! Are you telling me you don 't love me ? - If it 'll get you out of here , yes ! - Oh ! I thought you were special but you 're just like anybody else . All you care about 's your own small world , your precious work ! You 'd do anything for your work , use anyone . Just like Arthur . Just like Arthur ! Well , if that 's the way you want it . Emma ! What on earth are you doing ? Nothing ! Nothing ? You 've been in there , haven 't you ? Dressed like that ! Yes , your brilliant partner has been telling me ... Shh ! Be quiet , Emma . Come in the library . - Be quiet - I will not . Just what do you think you 're doing ? - I was with George . - I can see ! - Are you trying to wreck everything ? - None of your business . Oh , yes , it is my business . George McDee is my business ! Come here , Emma ! Come here ! Look at that . Do you know what that is ? That is a contract giving everything he has invented , everything he has discovered or will discover , all to our company ! Look , signed George McDee . Do you realise what that means ? I never understand such things . I leave all that to you . Good . Keep on doing just that ! George signed that yesterday afternoon . There 's millions to be made out of this ! We are going to go public ! We 'll become Mullrine International . How exciting Just make sure you don 't rock the boat . I don 't care what you say . - You 'd better start caring ! - Oh , really ? - I 'm sick of your selfish ways . - Indeed ? - I spoiled you , gave you everything . - Yes , indeed . You were happy for me to make love to George - while he considered a partnership . - That 's good business . I want my happiness now . I 'm not going to be used any more . I 'm sick of sharing George . I love him . Don 't talk such rubbish . He 's going to divorce Felicity and marry me . Oh , no you don 't , Emma Mullrine . We 're not having that . - There 'd be a scandal . - Damn the scandal ! You 've got what you wanted , now it 's my turn . I will have him . Emma ! - Emma , where are you going ? - Away from you ! - George ? - No , it 's me . What ? Who ? Emma . What do you want ? I 've got a dreadful headache . I have to talk to you . - Can 't it wait till morning ? - No , I want to talk to you now . All right . - What is it ? - George and I are in love . - What ? - He wants to marry me . Are you mad ? George is married to me . He 's going to leave you , Felicity . Nonsense . You 're making it up . George and I have been lovers for six months . It 's not true ... I won 't believe it , I won 't . He wants you to divorce him . Why isn 't he telling me himself ? He 's too soft-hearted . He 's afraid of you . George has never been afraid of anyone in his life ! Where is he ? In his laboratory , working . Get out of here . Are you going to give him his freedom ? Get out ! Leave me alone ! There 's something else you should know . George comes to my room every night . 'Steel ? Felicity has the gun . 'Steel , come to the laboratory . ' 'I 'm already in there . ' I 've told you , go away , I 'm busy ! You didn 't tell me , George . Felicity . Who did you think it was ? I just don 't want to be disturbed . You 're going to be , whether you like it or not . - Oh , please . - Go on , tell me . Who did you think it was ? Who have you already sent away ? - Look , this is important ! - This is more important . - Was it her ? - Her ? Who d 'you mean ? - Emma Mullrine . - Whatever gave you that idea ? - She did . - Oh , come on ! Don 't try to bluff , you 've never been a good liar . I don 't know what you 're talking about ! I 'm talking about your lover . About you wanting a divorce so that you can go off with her . - No , you 've got it all wrong . - Have I ? - Or has she ? - She ? What 's she been saying ? That you and she are lovers , that you want to leave me for her ! - No . - Is it true ? - Is what true ? - Is she your lover ? Yes . Yes , she is . I see . And what about me ? Felicity , what are you doing ? I won 't let you do it , George . I 'll kill you before I let her have you . Is this it ? Wait . That was it , that was the moment . Now time is on its new track . Well , stop them . Stop them ! Now take it back . Take time back . Let 's see how she killed him . Felicity , what are you doing ? I won 't let you do it , George . I 'll kill you before I let her have you . But that 's odd . That wasn 't it . That wasn 't the moment . It wasn 't Felicity who killed him . You still up , George ? Like a drink ? No . Where 's the agreement ? - Which one ? - Our agreement . The deal 's off . Oh , no , it isn 't . You signed it , it 's all legal . I 've changed my mind . I won 't do it . What 's happened ? A few hours back you were all excited . With your scientific brain and my business acumen , we 'll be rich ! Rich beyond our wildest dreams ! - Oh , no , you don 't . - I want those papers . - The deal 's off ! - Keep off me , George ! Not yet . - Keep away ! - You used your sister to entice me ! George , see reason ! She fell for you , George . It 's real , honest . It 's genuine . Emma 's head-over-heels in love with you . - Listen here , give me that ! - George ! Come in . Your tea , sir . Ah , shall I get another cup ? No , Mr McDee is just going to bed . Aren 't you , George ? - That wasn 't it , either . - No . It wasn 't . Felicity . Felicity ! Open this door , will you ? Felicity , I know you 're in there . If you don 't want to let me in I understand but ... when you 're ready to talk , you know where I 'll be . Felicity . What am I gonna do , Greville ? - It 's not easy , is it , sir ? - No . We can 't have a scandal . Not now . Good luck , sir . Thank you , Greville . Something tells me I 'm gonna need it . Emma , why did you do it ? ! You jilted me . I did not ! - You told me to get out . - Because I was working ! Surely we love each other ? Oh , I do hope so , George ! - I thought as much . - Felicity . This won 't do , George . This won 't do at all . You might as well leave him alone , Emma . I 'll never give him his freedom , never . He doesn 't love you . He loves me . Then I 'll make sure you can never have him . As long ... as I live . No , Emma , no ! For God 's sake , don 't ! 'Now ! ' 'Not yet . ' Stop it ! That 's it . That 's the moment . It was Emma ! It was you , you shot him , didn 't you ? - Yes . I didn 't mean to . - Shoot him again . - Kill him ! You must . - This is what I must do . This time . - Emma ? - Can you hear us ? - Of course . - Do you realise what you 're doing ? Yes , I 'm going to be happy . I 've got a second chance . - Does George know ? - No , only I know . You killed her . She 's dead ! - It 's all right , I 've been promised . - Promised what ? George and I are going to be young again . - What ? ! - Young again ! It 's a trick - time is tricking you ! - Who is time ? - Our enemy ! - Your enemy . - No , I have got a second chance George , my darling , you 're not going to die . We 'll be together for the rest of our lives ! If you don 't shoot George , there won 't be any rest of your lives . - I was promised . - Yes , but you 'll both die . And in a very short time . - What 's he saying ? - He 's right . These cultures will destroy you and every living creature on earth . There is no way of avoiding it once they get out of the lab . Rubbish . How could they ? Time is accelerating the disease . It 's not possible . Not only is it possible , it is inevitable . You have created mutant , persistent viruses that the world of 1930 cannot control . - Emma will be next . - I was promised . I was promised . It 's up to you . Everything must be exactly as it was . Only you can shoot George . You must do it . - You must do it ! - I can 't ... I can 't do it again . Emma ... George . Listen to me , my dearest , we love each other , don 't we ? - Can I touch her ? - Yes . Once we go back on the original track this will not have happened . Listen to me , my darling . You have to do it . It 's for my own sake . Would you have me destroy the human race ? Then you must kill me . It 's the only way . Kill me and let Felicity live . Promise . Be brave , my darling . Remember the good times we had , huh ? Remember me . George , my beloved , I shall keep you alive in my heart . Now , Sapphire . Take time back . - I thought as much . - Felicity . This won 't do , George . This won 't do at all . You might as well leave him alone , Emma . I 'll never give him his freedom , never . He doesn 't love you . He loves me . Then I 'll make sure you can never have him . As long ... as I live . No , Emma , no ! For God 's sake , don 't ! For God 's sake , don 't ! My God , what 's happened ? ! Emma ! George ! Greville , get them out of here quickly ! George ! 'Now , Sapphire , take time forwards . ' I hope you have a super party , sir . It 'll be different . Have to mark our 50th year of operation , don 't we ? Seems as good a way as any . 21st of June . Summer solstice . I remember noting it then . Lord Mullrine ! Oh , dear , thank you , Miss Shaw . Wouldn 't do to leave that behind . Lock myself out of my own office ? - Who knows what might happen ? - Indeed , yes , sir . Ahh , the cocktails . Good man , Greville . The first guests ! Yes . Now it all begins . How silly of me , I feel quite nervous . Yes , how silly of you , Emma . This is where we came in . And this is where we go out . Good evening , Mr Harborough , Mrs McDee . Mrs Harborough . - I like your monkey suit . - 1930 , sir . - Steel ! - Absolutely authentic ... Specially made by Lord Mullrine 's tailor . Must 've cost a fortune .

OKAY , YOU REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT THE TEXAS TRANQUILIZER ? IT WAS IN TIME . I CUT IT OUT . WAIT A SEC . SIT DOWN . ISSUE DATED : OCTOBER 4 , 1971 . '71 , RIGHT . IT 'S ABOUT WHY THERE ARE ALMOST NO MURDERS IN EL PASO . THIS SCIENTIST HAS THIS THEORY THAT THERE 'S SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM THE WATER IN EL PASO . IT COMES FROM DEEP WELLS , AND IT 'S GOT SOME CHEMICAL TRANQUILIZER IN IT . AND , WELL , READ . SEE , DALLAS IS OVER TWO TIMES AS BIG AS EL PASO . BUT THAT YEAR , THERE WERE OVER 242 MURDERS IN DALLAS , AND THERE WERE ONLY 13 IN EL PASO . JOANNA . JOANNA , I THINK THAT 'S WHAT 'S GOING ON IN STEPFORD . I THINK THERE 'S SOMETHING IN THE WATER ... THAT TURNS US INTO HAUSFRAUS , DRONES , WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT . CHARMAINE 'S CHANGED , CAROL VAN SANT 'S CHANGED ... AND SO HAVE ALL THOSE OTHER WOMEN 'S CLUB MEMBERS . WELL I- - I SUPPOSE IT 'S POSSIBLE . IT CAN 'T ALL BE COINCIDENCE . [ Bobby ] LOOK AT ALL THOSE PLACES . ELECTRONICS . COMPUTERS . AEROSPACE JUNK . AND LABS . WHO KNOWS WHAT ? THEY MUST ALL BE DUMPING THEIR CHEMICAL GARBAGE ... INTO STEPFORD RIVER . AND IT COULD BE MAKING ITS WAY TO US . LISTEN , THE 6 : 00 NEWS SCARES ME EVERY NIGHT . I DON 'T SEE WHAT 'S SO FAR OUT ABOUT MY THEORY . ALL RIGHT , WHY DON 'T WE WRITE THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY ... AND HAVE THEM CHECK THE WATER IN THE RESERVOIR ? AH , GOVERNMENT AGENCIES . I 'VE WORKED FOR THEM , JOANNA . AND IF THEY 'RE WAY ABOVE AVERAGE OR ANY GOOD AT ALL , THEY 'LL MANAGE TO LOSE A LETTER IF YOU SEND IT TO THEM . THEY TEACH COURSES IN MISFILING AT THOSE PLACES . YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO ? I THINK WE OUGHT TO TAKE A SAMPLE OF THE WATER OURSELVES ... AND THEN GET IT TO A TRUSTWORTHY CHEMIST . THE TROUBLE IS I DON 'T KNOW ANYBODY EXCEPT , YOU KNOW , GUYS AT THAT STINKING MEN 'S ASSOCIATION . I LOST MY VIRGINITY TO A TRUSTWORTHY CHEMIST . HA HA ! NO KIDDING ! DID HE DO IT ON BLUE CROSS ? HIS NAME WAS RAYMOND CHANDLER . OH , GOSH . AND WE HAD A GAG , A SORT OF A STUPID , PRIVATE THING GOING . I USED TO ASK HIM WHY HE DIDN 'T TALK LIKE HE WROTE . HE WASN 'T A BIT HARD-BOILED , AND HE HATED ANY SORT OF VIOLENCE . BUT I KEPT IT GOING . SOME NIGHTS I WOULDN 'T LET HIM TOUCH ME ... UNTIL HE TOLD ME THE PLOT OF HIS NEXT NOVEL . WHICH WAS , OF COURSE , THE BIG SLEEP . [ Chuckles ] SOMETIMES , IT NEARLY DROVE HIM CRAZY . ISN 'T IT FUNNY THE THINGS YOU DO WHEN YOU 'RE IN LOVE ? WE WERE BOTH SENIORS AT NYU . AND IT WASN 'T JUST PASSION . IT WAS LOVE . WHY DIDN 'T YOU MARRY HIM ? I DON 'T KNOW . [ Sighs ] MAYBE WE TOOK THE JOKE TOO FAR . MAYBE THE FUN WENT OUT OF IT . I THOUGHT WALTER WAS GOING TO BECOME PERRY MASON . SO IT WAS FAREWELL , MY LOVELY . DID YOU EVER SEE THAT ? ANYWAY , I THINK IF I LOOK IN THE PHONE BOOK ... AND THIS GUY 'S STILL IN NEW YORK , THEN HE 'S OUR MAN . ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ? NO . I CAN 'T JUST CALL HIM UP AND SAY , " HI . I USED TO BE JOANNA INGALLS . YOU DEFLOWERED ME 12 YEARS AGO .

IT 'S THE REST THAT BOTHERS ME . JUST TRY TO LOOK AT IT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW , JOANNA . WALTER , I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING TO YOU . BOBBY REALLY HAS CHANGED . BELIEVE ME , EVERYTHING IN HER HOUSE LOOKED LIKE A TV COMMERCIAL . WELL , GOOD ! GOOD ! SHE HAD TO CLEAN IT SOONER OR LATER . IT LOOKED LIKE A GODDAMN PIGSTY ! [ Scoffs ] I-I MEAN , WHEN ARE THINGS GONNA START SPARKLING AROUND HERE ? THAT 'S WHAT I 'D LIKE TO KNOW . I MEAN , JUST LOOK AT THE WAY MY KIDS ARE DRESSED . RAGAMUFFINS . GEEZ , I WORK 80 HOURS A WEEK . I LIVE IN A GREAT HOUSE AND MY KIDS LOOK LIKE THEY BELONG ON WELFARE . LOOK , IF YOU PAID A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION TO YOUR FAMILY ... AND A LITTLE LESS TO YOUR GODDAMN PICTURE TAKING- - I 'M GETTING OUT OF STEPFORD . I 'M GETTING US A HOUSE NOW . AND IF IT 'S HARD ON YOU , TOUGH . AND IF IT 'S HARD ON THE KIDS , I 'LL JUST EASE UP ON MY GODDAMN PICTURE TAKING ... AND STAY AROUND THE HOUSE , AND BELIEVE ME , THEY 'LL SURVIVE . THAT 'S WHAT I 'M TALKING ABOUT , WALTER , IS SURVIVING . OKAY ! ALL RIGHT ! I MEAN , I 'LL TAKE A LOSS ON THIS GREAT HOUSE IF I HAVE TO . BUT THERE 'S ONE CONDITION OR WE DON 'T GO ANYWHERE . YOU- - YOU SEE SOMEBODY . YOU GET SOME HELP . YOU SEE A PSYCHIATRIST . I 'M FINE . I DON 'T NEED TO SEE ANYBODY . YOU SAY YOU 'RE FINE . BUT ME , I 'D- - I 'D LIKE ANOTHER OPINION . BECAUSE I 'M NOT TOO ANXIOUS TO MOVE TO EASTBRIDGE ... AND AFTER FOUR MONTHS THERE BE TOLD BY MY SWEET WIFE WE 'VE GOT TO MOVE AGAIN ... BECAUSE SHE DOESN 'T LIKE THE WAY HER NEW NEIGHBORS KEEP THEIR HOUSES CLEAN . [ Sighs ] LOOK , I 'M NOT ASKING ANYTHING UNREASONABLE . AND I DON 'T LIKE ASKING IT . BUT- - BUT YOU WANT ME TO DISRUPT OUR LIVES ... FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS ON SOME FIXATION YOU 'VE GOT . THAT 'S THE UNREASONABLE PART . YOU 'VE GOT TO SEE THAT . LOOK ... YOU AND ME , WE- - WE DON 'T HAVE TO FIGHT ABOUT THIS . WE 'RE GONNA MOVE . IT 'S- - IT 'S ONLY A FEW MORE WEEKS . LOOK ... IT DOESN 'T HAVE TO BE ANYTHING DRAMATIC . THERE 'S A COUPLE OF TOPNOTCH GUYS RIGHT HERE IN TOWN . JUST TALK TO ONE OF THEM . THEY 'D SEE YOU . BUT I WOULDN 'T SEE THEM . IF I SEE ANYBODY , I 'LL FIND MY OWN . [ Joanna ] I 'M HERE AT MY HUSBAND 'S INSISTENCE . WE MOVED TO STEPFORD WITH OUR CHILDREN , OH , A FEW MONTHS AGO . BEFORE THAT , WE WERE IN MANHATTAN . AND NOW I WANT TO MOVE OUT . YOU SEE , I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE GENERAL AREA . BUT THE WOMEN IN STEPFORD JUST SEEM TO BE ON A DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH . [ Woman ] WELL , THAT ALL SEEMS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD . AND YOUR HUSBAND WANTS YOU TO SEE ME BECAUSE ? HE FEELS I 'M BEING ... IRRATIONAL . HE SAYS THERE 'S NO CERTAINTY I 'D LIKE ... EASTBRIDGE OR SOMEPLACE LIKE THAT ANY BETTER . AND HE DOESN 'T WANT TO SPEND HIS LIFE MOVING FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER . YES . UNDERSTANDABLE . BUT STEPFORD , I KNOW , HAS A REPUTATION FOR BEING UNSOCIAL . SO I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU MIGHT BE UNHAPPY THERE . I 'D BE UNHAPPY THERE . ANY MOVE IS TRAUMATIC . AND A CITY-TO-SUBURBS MOVE FOR A WOMAN WITH INTERESTS OTHER THAN PURELY FAMILY ... CAN SEEM LIKE A JAUNT TO SIBERIA . WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF IF I SAID WESTPORT , CONNECTICUT ? WRITERS . ARTISTS . NOW YOU HAVE NO REASON TO KNOW THIS , BUT TRURO , MASSACHUSETTS , IS SORT OF AN ELEPHANT 'S GRAVEYARD FOR PSYCHOANALYSTS . PERHAPS STEPFORD IS HEAVEN FOR THE HOUSE AND GARDEN TYPE . ONE PERSON TELLS ANOTHER- - [ Laughs ] SOME DON 'T LIKE IT AND LEAVE . OTHERS THAT DO LIKE IT , ARRIVE . I MEAN , WESTPORT DIDN 'T ALWAYS HAVE WRITERS . THEY DIDN 'T BREED FROM THE ORIGINAL PAIR . I UNDERSTAND . WELL , I 'M NOT SURPRISED . YOU 'RE OBVIOUSLY A VERY BRIGHT WOMAN . WHAT DOES SURPRISE ME IS THAT YOU HAVE COME ALL THIS WAY TO TALK TO ME ... AND THEN YOU DON 'T TALK TO ME . I THINK THE MEN ARE BEHIND IT . WHAT MEN ? ALL OF THEM . ALL OF THEM IN THE ASSOCIATION . MY HUSBAND . EVERYONE . THE WOMEN DON 'T- - CAN 'T ARRIVE IN STEPFORD LOVING HOUSEWORK . THEY CHANGE ONCE THEY GET THERE . I THINK THE MEN MAKE THEM CHANGE . HOW WOULD THEY DO THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW . THEY- - THEY- - OH , JESUS ! IT 'S SO AWFUL . IF I 'M WRONG , I 'M INSANE . AND IF I 'M RIGHT , IT 'S WORSE THAN IF I 'M WRONG . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO EXACTLY . THEY- - THEY DRAW OUR PICTURES , AND THEY TAPE OUR VOICES ... AND THE WOMEN ALL LOOK NEAT AND PRETTY . THERE 'S A MAN . HE 'S- - HE 'S A DRUGGIST . HE RUNS THE PHARMACY . AND HE 'S NOTHING . HE 'S NOTHING . BUT HIS WIFE IS JUST BREATHTAKING . AND ONCE , BY MISTAKE , I HAPPENED TO HEAR THEM MAKING LOVE . AND SHE WAS CARRYING ON INCREDIBLY , LIKE HE WAS SOME KIND OF GOD 'S GIFT . AND CHARMAINE CHANGED IN FOUR MONTHS AND RIPPED UP HER TENNIS COURT . AND BOBBY , MY BEST FRIEND , CHANGED IN FOUR MONTHS . AND THAT 'S WHAT CONVINCED ME . THAT 'S HOW LONG I 'VE BEEN IN STEPFORD : FOUR MONTHS . AND I DON 'T KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON . I JUST KNOW SOMETHING 'S WRONG , AND MY TIME IS COMING . YOU 'RE TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED , AREN 'T YOU ? CAN YOU SLEEP ? WELL , THAT 'S EASY . WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT . AND WE 'LL SEE A LOT OF EACH OTHER , AND YOU CAN TALK SOME MORE . SEE , IT 'S UNFORTUNATE , BUT I HAVE TO GO AWAY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS . IT 'S SOMETHING I CAN 'T PUT OFF AT THIS SHORT NOTICE . BUT WHEN I 'M BACK , WE 'LL TALK . NO ! NO , YOU DON 'T WANT TO TALK OR WHAT ? I WON 'T BE HERE WHEN YOU GET BACK . DON 'T YOU SEE ? IT 'S GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEN . DON 'T ASK ME TO EXPLAIN IT . I JUST KNOW .

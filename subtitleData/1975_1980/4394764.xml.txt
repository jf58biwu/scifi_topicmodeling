 ( DOGS BARKING ) ( DOG WHIMPERING ) We 've been looking for you for days . You ... You go off like that , on your own , just leaving us a note . Why ? Now , if Hubert and I hadn 't come ... Oh , stop lecturing me , Charles . Jenny ! Jenny ! Agnes ! Oh ! What 's it all for ? Sweet FA . Never found him and he was there all the time , so it seems . The sooner we 're all safe back home at Challoner , the better . We 're going to Lichfield . Eh ? Brickyard and a pottery near there . That 's where Greg is , or he will be in a couple of days , according to Agnes . Anyway , by now , it 's nearer than Challoner . How long is that going to take us ? Three or four days , at the most . Where are we going to spend the nights ? Here , Jenny saw an elephant at Marbury . Did she tell you ? Wild beasts on the loose . She 's lost her gun , we 've got little or no provisions , my gun 's up the spout ... So , Hubert still grumbles , does he ? Cheer up , Hubert . We 'll spend tomorrow night at a farm about 20 miles from here . Greg and I visited it on our way from Whitecross . It 's run by a man called Tom Walter . There 's nothing even Greg could teach Tom . The Walters have everything . Everything , you said . Didn 't include rats , did you ? We were to set a camp here . We 'd better light a fire . At least there 's plenty to burn . What about the roast lamb I was promised ? Nothing to eat all day . You can go longer than a day before you feel it . - Speak for yourself . - Hubert ! Light a fire ! Jenny and I will go and hunt something . ( SHOT FIRING ) ( PIG SQUEALING ) Charles ? I 'll look . ( SQUEALING ) Get back , Charles . You 're on foot . What is it ? It 's a pig . - Get back ! - It 's all right . JENNY : Well , kill it . CHARLES : With a shotgun ? Shoot it through the eyes . ( PIG SQUEALING ) Leave that pig alone . Who are you ? Who are you ? This is our territory . What do you mean , your territory ? Stalking deer . OWEN : Until your shot scared ' em off . ( SQUEALING STOPS ) STEVE : Right , then , let 's get it , shall we ? Lucky you didn 't go in the woods yourself . Nasty things , are traps . You don 't know where they 're set . Have to get it right through the top of the head . Takes a long time dying , otherwise . Well , come on , then , give us an hand . Whoa , now . Is that your friend 's horse up there ? Yes , I 'll get him . Oh , get him up . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) STEVE : Here , pull him up . Pull him up . Come on , hand this up . Pull it . That 's it . What else do you hunt ? Game . Deer . We don 't need no guns , neither . Right , then , let 's get going . The only place we 're going is back to our friends . Who the hell do you think you are ? Brod 's men . Who 's Brod ? He says shoot first and then ask the questions . You could learn something from him . Now , are you going to ride or walk ? Where 's Brod ? Not to be disturbed . Is she sick ? She 's exhausted . ( JENNY PANTING ) Over here , by the fire . Owen , bring some soup . OWEN : All right . CHARLES : I think she 's too tired to eat . Found ' em in the woods . With a shotgun . They got friends on the farm , he says . We 'd be with them now , if it weren 't for you two . Fetch ' em . At this time of night ? Only just made it here . I 'm not going over that hill again . - They 're in the farmhouse ? - There 's rats in the house . Well , the dogs 'll get ' em . They 'll have made a fire . They 'll be all right till morning . We 'll fetch ' em then . Bring that soup over here , Owen . Where are you from ? The West Country . It 's a long story . We thought there 'd be a community at that farm , but it 's deserted . It 's my son 's farm , Tom Walter 's . Are you his mother ? These two are my youngest , Steve and Owen . They 're more Brod 's lads now . Who is this Brod ? He drove us from the farm . Tom had gone by then and we were helpless . Well , I ... I 'll get you all something to eat , and then indoors for a good night 's sleep . Indoors , where ? Won 't tell Brod ? EDITH : He 's got company . Mavis ? Tell him tomorrow , when you fetch his friends . Oh , poor girl , she 's worn out . Aye , we 've had a rough time . ( DOG BARKING ) ( WHISPERING ) Charles . Charles . Oh ... ( SIGHING ) Did you sleep well ? We 're on a train . Yes . I know . You were so exhausted last night , I carried you in here myself . A railway carriage ? There 's three of them , on an embankment . Look . Dogs can 't get up there . And on this side ... ( GRUNTING ) Protected by the river . JENNY : Who are they ? CHARLES : A bunch of brigands , I think . Brod 's gang , whoever Brod may be . Had a good kip ? You should have . First-class compartment to yourselves ? Jenny and Charles , right ? Well , are you Brod ? Where 's the ammo for this popgun ? - I 'm wearing it . - Let 's have it . It 's my gun . On my railway . Do you all sleep on this train ? Yeah , except those who don 't pull their weight . They sleep with the horses . The more serious offenders , they sleep on that side of the embankment . Sometimes we don 't see ' em again . We didn 't ask to board your train , you know . You had a sight more comfortable night than your friends did in the open air . - Hubert and Agnes . - I was told they were being fetched . Yeah , they 're in the dining car , tucking in to porridge . Are you two hungry ? I expect Jenny 's starving . I had something to eat last night . - Yeah , so I heard . A right good nosh-up . - Yes . I feed everyone well . That 's why they all love me . I look after ' em . I 'll see you in the dining car . You 'll find my rates are quite reasonable . - Rates ? - Mmm . For bed and breakfast . AGNES : How did it happen ? You had cows to make cheese and sheep to give you wool . You even had your own loom . And there was a mill that Tom got working , too . But no grain . We had more cheese and wool than we needed , but no flour . Tom thought we should trade , so he went up to the Dales , where he heard people were growing wheat . - How long has he been gone ? - Three months . Brod showed up the day after he left . He started raiding us . He carried off everything he needed , even our bull . In the end , without Tom , we had no choice but to join him . ( DOOR OPENING ) Enjoying your breakfast ? ( BURPS ) Oh , pardon me . Good . My stomach didn 't know what had hit it . ( CHUCKLING ) All you have to do now is earn it . These people are our guests . You 'll find it 's a funny thing about this train , it doesn 't carry passengers . Tell you another funny thing about it . It 's not going anywhere , neither . Get off any time you like . Find your own food and shelter . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) We won 't impose on you . We 'll be off just as soon as we can . Fine , when you 've settled up . Charles is looking round your camp . Doesn 't he want breakfast ? Oh , after all you stuffed him with last night ? I 'll get you some porridge and a spoon . A spoon ! ( CHUCKLING ) Edith likes us all to eat daintily on this train . She were a schoolmarm , you know . So you 'd better watch out , Hubert , or teacher 'll send you out of the room for dirty manners . ( LAUGHING ) I 'll , uh , see you all at the fire when you feel you 've had sufficient . Except you , Jenny . You can work your passage by sweeping out the train , okay ? Oh , and don 't forget my compartment . I 'll come back later ... to inspect . Sooner we 're out of here , the better . See that scarf he was wearing ? Sheffield United . What is this ? Football special ? Does it need more salt ? I 've got some here . I try and keep everything here that 's at all precious . JENNY : No , it 's fine , thanks . Save the salt . You were a teacher ? Well , we were all something once . Tom was at agricultural college then . Steve and Owen were mechanics . Tom found the farm and they joined him . You 're not really going to move on at once , are you ? - Well , uh ... - I need you , to get the farm back . What do you think of the net fishing ? Bank from bank . Bend the other side , you scoop up all you want . What if somebody downstream fancies a nice fish ? Ah , Charlie , it 's all I need . Taking a stroll ? A nice , pleasant walk round the gardens before lunch ? What became of that bull you stole from Edith Walter ? Ran away . Proved a match for you , did it ? You surprise me . I 'll hunt it down one day . And kill it for meat ? I used to be a butcher in a slaughterhouse . Can 't live on meat , you know . ( LAUGHS ) We don 't . Here , you see those kids there ? They know all about nuts and grasses and herbs , and I 've taught ' em all they know . How did a butcher learn ? From a mate of mine . This is his scarf . Football fan , was he ? Andy ? He were a poacher . He taught me more about survival than I 'd ever learn from you . What became of him ? He tried to be a farmer , settle down , grow crops , but the dogs didn 't take to him . If he 'd stayed a hunter ... Edith Walter had a very good farm before you came raiding it . Ah , come on ! There 's nothing a farmer can grow that you can 't get by hunting . It 's a jungle out there ! How long will a farm last these days against the dogs ? It 's gone mad out there ! Once we link up and start trading , man will soon get control again . Ah , you 're a dreamer ! It 's about time you earned your night 's lodging . My water butt needs filling up . Put it round your neck . It 's a yoke . Yah ! ( HORSE GALLOPING AWAY ) Less than a quart from the cows this morning . Oh . We used to have enough to make cheese , all sorts of cheese . I remember . Most of it 's still stored up at the farm , and our wool , too , if the rats haven 't got it by now . Well , I 'd better go and see to the master 's room . Jenny 's doing that , the girl who came last night . Oh , so she 's the new chambermaid , is she ? What happened to your sheep ? There are still a few left . The rest are up on the hills somewhere . He kills them as he wants them . They 'll kill themselves if they go on eating that rubbish . They should be up on the hills with a couple of good shepherds to keep guard . Safe enough , if you bring ' em in at night . Yeah , that 's the way we used to do it . Didn 't we , Owen ? Remember when you were a shepherd ? Oh , he finds life more exciting now . Tom taught you to be smiths . We still are . That forge is ours over there . All they ever make is arrowheads . Oh , if I don 't get home soon , Agnes , there 'll be nothing left to start again with . Charlie 's bringing water from the river . We don 't need any . The butt 's full . BROD : So is the river . ( CHUCKLING ) Pick it up , Hubert . Now , then , blondie , can you carry water on your head ? Like a slave girl ? Let 's see . Come here . Come on . Stand here . There we are . Now , then ... Let 's see how you look . Stevie , give us your bow . Come on , Hubert , take a good look at her . EDITH : Just keep still , Agnes . What is it he 's doing ? What the devil are you up to ? Just watch . ( LAUGHING ) HUBERT : I thought it was supposed to be an apple . I could do it with a chestnut . Right , then , let 's see how you 'll get on . No ! Show off if you like ! BROD : What , afraid you might miss ? ( BROD LAUGHING ) Right , then , time for archery practice . Bring him to the butts , Owen . Come on ! I said to move ! You heard him . Run ! Go on ! BOTH : One , two ! One , two ! One , two ! One , two ! One , two ! Come on ! He wants you all grovelling to him . He has to . Otherwise , people might think there 's a more civilised way to live , and what would become of him then ? Leave him . Round off your cattle and sheep and take everyone back to the farm . No one would follow me . Have you tried ? Oh , if Tom were still with me , they might , but just me ? Brod could shoot a pea off your head . I can 't shoot at all . Your farm 's well protected , as long as Brod 's not there to raid it . Steve and Owen must know that , at least . It 's not just that it 's safer to ride behind Brod than farm with me . Learn to hunt , shoot straight , you 're invincible these days . Oh , it 's a great life for a lad . Getting better and better . Come on , then , Hubert . ( ALL LAUGHING ) Now , then , Hubert ... Steve , come here . You 've got to get the hold right first . Steve will show you . He 'll give you a few lessons . We 'll soon make a hunter out of you , Hubert . What makes you think that ? The way you ate your breakfast this morning . ( ALL LAUGHING ) HUBERT : Doesn 't seem right , how you hold it . Finished ? Yes , sir . Come in . Let 's see . You haven 't finished the bed . Folded the blanket . Should be properly tucked in . I 'm surprised you don 't have sheets . ( CHUCKLES ) You 're surprised at a lot more than that . I 'm beginning to get used to it . Charlie can spend the mornings fetching water , I think . He needs toughening up . In the afternoons , I 'll teach him to hunt . We 're not staying here , you know . Is that a fact ? Edith is hoping you 'll get the farm back for her . You could do that yourself . Yeah . I 'll put Hubert on guard duty . Sit him on his backside at the entrance with a crossbow all day . Should be a nice , cushy job for him . ( CHUCKLING ) But he 'll have to learn to shoot straight first . What about me and Agnes ? Agnes can help Edith . As for you , you know the old saying , " If you make your bed , you must lie in it . " Your work will be the least arduous of ' em all . ( COCKS GUN ) Does she want to ? What do you think , Charles ? CHARLES : Did you even ask ? Let 's get the horses , Hubert . You think you have some right ? BROD : Those are my terms . Terms ! Your whole style 's like some robber-baron out of a fairytale , a giant in his castle , droit de seigneur . Is it a deal or not ? You knew from the start it never would be . Certain services in return for board and lodging ? Now , fair 's fair . - Where 's Agnes ? - Feeding the horses . BROD : With my fodder ? CHARLES : You tell her to fetch them . Tell her we 're leaving . BROD : Where for ? CHARLES : That 's our concern . They can go to the Sheridans ' . Some people we know up the river . It 's not more than 30 miles . You 'll be there by dark . She hasn 't even seen him for a year . I 'm sure they 're still there . Why shouldn 't they be ? No , we 're not going there . We 're going back to your farm , Edith , with you . Well , well , how about that ? How will I manage without you ? Exactly . Without Edith to cook and organise for you , this place will fall apart . Edith 's going back to the farm . Will you desert me , too , Mavis ? Right , get your things together . We 're leaving . The boys must come , too . If they want , they 'll soon follow . - Will you stay till they do ? - CHARLES : All right . You could be in for quite a long wait . - A couple of days at most . - I don 't think I 'll have her back . When the time comes for you to get on your travels again , and you don 't like to leave her on her own . She 'll not be on her own by then . I 'm going to talk to the boys . Subvert my people ? - Go to the Sheridans ' . Keep ... - No ! You go to the farm . Show them you have some confidence in it and they 'll all come back to it . Allow me to think I know them better than you do , Jenny . We 'll keep in touch , from the Sheridans ' . We 've got the horses ready , but one 's gone lame . Now , that 's a good mare , guvnor . If you 'll let us have one in exchange , you 'll not lose by it . No one takes my horses . - You can ride behind me , Hubert . - I 'll let you have food , mind . Me own dinner . Have the whole joint . - Whose is this ? - Edith 's . BROD : On a plate ? I might have guessed . - My shawl ! - Not very ladylike ? Let me have those rabbits , too . I 'll skin ' em , Mavis . You know , you get more like my missus every day . ( LAUGHING ) You were married ? Yes ! And she thought I was uncouth , too . A butcher . She ran off with a tax inspector , tried to better herself . Intellectual type . You 're not a tax inspector , are you , Charlie ? You can forget about the food . Need something for the journey . There speaks sense . A man after me own heart , is Hubert . Another Andy . Tie it all up in that shawl . Open the carriage door , Mavis . Open it . ( DOGS BARKING ) Throw that food down the embankment . Well , come on , Mavis ! Oh ! Now , then ... Get on after it . You can 't send them off on foot . They 're welcome to stay , if they like . I 've offered ' em fair terms , taking their share of the work . Perhaps if you left Jenny alone , they might accept . Jenny ? She 's the Dutch of it ! Now , are you going or staying ? Don 't seem to have any choice . You 've got a choice , mate . - Hang about , Charles . - Hubert ... All right . Give me my gun . Guns are for hunters , not farmers . Well , give them something to protect themselves , then . Do you want to go , too ? Come on , then . Got a long walk ahead of us . ( DOGS BARKING ) It 's past belief . Risking your lives , rather than stay with me ? The whole country 's a jungle ! It 's a wild , crazy shambles out there ! And you want to hold on to your daft , toffee-nosed pride ? ( DOGS BARKING ) Well , you can 't tell me I 'm so uncouth that you 'd rather die than ... Yes , you are ! What do you think we 're surviving for ? To live like you ? Get after ' em ! ( DOG GROWLING ) You knew they 'd do that ! It 's time they faced facts ! You know , I have a whole joint for dinner , so there 's plenty left over to throw to the dogs . The less hungry they are , the less troublesome ! BROD : My terms , understand ? ( GRUNTING ) Anything I want , get it ? Yeah , daring , aren 't you ? You 'll learn a lot more tomorrow , when I start to make a hunter out of you . Hey ! Hyah . Now , search , Steve ! Take Hubert ! You know the drill ! Go on , Hubert , get after him ! Think you 're a big man , don 't you , Brod ? Big enough to see things as they are , and face up to ' em . Not big enough to see things as they could be . Get off your nag . We 'll hunt on foot . You know , instead of hunting in this jungle , you could clear it with your skill , make it safe for traders . You 'd be the biggest man round here for miles . I 'd try something other than flattery , if I were you . ( CHUCKLING ) Well , I 'm saving common sense for the others . They won 't desert me , Charlie . No ? Until now , you 've had no competition . You mean to challenge me ? What do you think ? We 'll just stick around here till we find a safe means of escape ? Can 't leave this area . It 's too important . Owen ! Give me your bow ! Take care of the horses . I 'll show you how to load it when the time comes . Where 'd you get these ? Museum . I made that one . Steve made his own , as well . Modelled them on Brod 's . Used a couple of old car springs , moulded the rest of the metal on the forge . First-rate job . - Will you make one for me ? - Sure . Only if I say so . Oh , if you can make one of these , you can make anything . Invaluable , a skill like that . ( STEVE WHISTLES ) That 's Steve . Get going , Charlie . I 'm right behind you . AGNES : Books ? JENNY : Edith 's . Middlemarch by George Eliot . The Bible . English Crafts . The Poems of John Clare . Was he a great English poet ? Well , I liked him . I wonder why she keeps them ? They 're important to her . No one 's ever going to read again , are they ? Well , if not , what 's it all for ? Cheer up . Hmm , all you have to do is the dishes . Well , how do you like being the new chambermaid , then ? Was that your job ? Till you turned up . You can have it back any time you like . Oh , you 've nothing to fear . All Brod can ever raise are your hopes , which are very soon dashed . Well , why do you think he has to be such a man other times ? Why don 't you just slaughter a couple of Edith 's sheep ? She 's still got one or two left . If anything should happen to me , Charlie , those boys of Edith have orders they 'll enjoy carrying out , to do with Jenny . Nothing 's going to happen to you , Brod . There 's no need . Get behind that tree . Wait till I whistle . All right . I 'll learn anything from any man , even you . Can I have a bolt ? Keep your eyes skinned for anything that moves . Everything 's an enemy here . Everything . ( SIGHS ) ( SCREAMING ) Hey ! ( GASPING ) God ! ( GRUNTING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) Hubert ! This way ! - Get after him ! - Come on , get up there ! - Charles ! - Hubert ! I 'm over here , Hubert . - Oh ! - Blasted trap ! I 'll try . HUBERT : Oh , you 've done it now . ( GRUNTING ) - Can you move it ? - Yes , yes . At worst , it 's only bruised . He was to be left for the dogs . Now , Hubert , that 's not true . It was an accident . Like hell it was . ( GROANS ) Don 't ! HUBERT : He 'll try it again . We 've got to get out of here . If you 're right ... If you 're right , it shows just how unsure he is . What do you say , Edith ? It 's his very weakness that makes him so dangerous . Rather than admit it , he 'll do something desperate . You 've got to get away from here at the first opportunity . What do you want ? To settle up . ( GRUNTING ) CHARLES : Oh , it 's no good . It 's no good . I can 't walk . You can go by boat . This , uh , Greg of yours , when did you last see him ? - Eight months ago . - You reckon you will again ? Of course . Did you support a club ? Club ? Football ! No . No , my missus didn 't care for it , either . I used to go every Saturday with Andy . I came back one day and found her note . Do you think the stuck-up little bitch is still alive ? - Probably not . - Andy isn 't . But it 'd be just like it if she was , wouldn 't it ? You know ... Andy , he held onto this scarf through all the running from the plague . He 'd never even seen a game until I took him to one . He were a farmer . But at least he were a poacher at night . Engineer , Edith said . - Greg ? - Yeah , intellectual type . - He 's very practical . - Not as practical as me . Well , he can make things work , machines . That 's why he went to Norway , to get industry started again . You call that being practical ? - Well , once we have power again ... - Dreams ! Industry ? That can never happen . There are millions more rats than people now . Even the dogs outnumber us . Wildlife has taken over . Even Charlie knows that , but he won 't admit it . It 's the hunters you have to depend on now . Oh , yeah , the big men ! That 's right ! Don 't you take the mickey out of me ! Selling yourself , so I 'll be nice and kind to your friends and they won 't get hurt ? Get out of here ! Do I come back tonight , or shall I send Mavis instead ? So , she 's been sniggering to you , has she ? Just because she doesn 't turn me on and never has ? If I do come , it 'll be in the hope that I might be able to find someone here I could want . What do you mean ? A hunter doesn 't turn me on at all . But if you were lying there , curled up under that blanket like a little boy , any woman might want you then , and you might want her . CHARLES : Jenny ? Jenny ? Anyone seen Jenny ? Better find her . Can 't go without her . Jenny 's in the train , if you 're looking for her . Edith , are you going , too ? No , of course I 'm not . I just want some of my things in safe keeping at the Sheridans ' . - Oh , just give it here . There we are . - Oh , thank you . Hubert ... Take everything out of the boat . We 're staying . - EDITH : But Charles ... - What for ? We 're staying until everybody comes with us , back to Edith 's farm , to live in rooms again , with walls . MAN : What about the rats ? We can take care of those . Chop down the nettles , tear up the weeds , let those sheep have a chance to breed before they poison themselves on laurel and yew , spin wool again , make clothes , and if that mill upstream is in as good nick as I 'm told it is , we could put a generator there , make electricity , electric light . So , who 's coming with me ? Now , you shoot me , Steve , and you won 't get another chance . You 'll be with Brod for always . It 's a nice night for a lad , hunting , shooting , pillaging . But what about for a man , Steve ? One day you 'll find yourself left behind in a wood , by accident , of course . Rowing off without telling me ? Scared I 'll come after you with a big stick ? Well , go on . Leave . We don 't need you . We 're leaving , just as soon as everybody 's ready . Well , you heard . Electric light , nice , cosy rooms , tiny little lambs a-frisking in the fields . Ah , pretty ! And some of you can shoot . So you won 't need me to deal with the dogs or find you enough to eat in the winter . It 's not running away from Brod that matters , it 's being seen to run away by the others . If we ... If we can 't cope with that lout , how can we be relied upon to drive back the rest of the jungle ? Jungle ? That is Brod 's word . Once we catch up with Greg ... Greg ! What good will he be if we can 't cope with that ? Everything we hoped for out of Norway will come to nothing . Meanwhile , it all proliferates out there in a way that only Brod has faced up to . Perhaps you should join him and be done with it , then . What ? Well , if it is just a dream that we 'll ever get back to civilised living again . ( SIGHS ) Believe that , and there 's no point in going home . Well , perhaps there isn 't . Perhaps we should put ourselves in Brod 's hands . He can shoot and hunt and protect us all . And have the country taken over by warrior tribes , hunting in packs , like the dogs ? Well , it was the way of the old world on a bigger scale than that . Carry your card , pay your dues , join the pack , follow my leader , brother against brother , in the name of brother . And why people like us got away from it all , to nice safe havens , like your friends up the river . Well , what else can we do ? You 'll never get Steve and Owen to take up farming after this . We 'll win them over in the end . You didn 't get through to them just now , Charles . Well , we ... We made a start . I got Brod worried , anyway . Look ! Look , he 's out there now , wondering what our next move will be . EDITH : Or wondering what his own will be . Got him worried ? Yes , that 's what worries me . Because you need time . He doesn 't . A hunter , moving in for the kill . He won 't botch it this time . You did what ? I tried to seduce him . There was something Mavis said put me on to it . Make a man of him in bed , and maybe he wouldn 't have to compensate so desperately in other ways . Mmm , there 's something in it , and I know just how it could be done , but I have to pretend to fancy him and I find him repellent . - Perhaps Mavis ? - No , it has to be me . Oh , no , no , that 's not the way ! Well , what do you suggest , then ? I 'll think of something . When ? Edith 's right . He 's not going to give you much time . You can practise on your own , can 't you , Hubert ? - Yeah . - Eh ? Try and keep the arrows on the target , eh ? ( DOGS BARKING ) - I think there 's only one way . - What 's that ? - The way he would choose . - No . The way he 's planning to get rid of you now . That would play right into his hands . Who cares about that if he 's dead ? Once we do things his way , everything we stand for loses credibility . ( GRUNTING ) Help ! Help ! I shot him ! I shot Brod ! Help ! Help ! Get it out ! ( GRUNTING ) ( GASPING ) It was an accident . Come on . Get him under cover . BROD : I always said you 'd make a hunter , Hubert . Oh , easy ! ( GASPING ) Is this how you wanted me , Jenny ? Steve , Owen , water , bandages ! Curled up , like a little boy ? ( GRUNTING ) You 'll be all right , if we can stop the bleeding . Ah , you 're lucky , Charlie , to have Hubert . Only tell him , he must learn to shoot straight . I should think so , if he was aiming for those posts . He wasn 't so wide of the mark . It was an accident . Dreamer ! AGNES : Try and get his vest off . It shows I was right , doesn 't it ? It ... It 's either you or the next guy . Ask Hubert . Talking will only make you weaker . Oh ! How would you have cut me down to size , eh ? I 'd have won , if it hadn 't been for Hubert and you know I would . And Jenny couldn 't have stopped me , either . A little boy ! ( CHUCKLING ) I ... I 'd have never have had the courage to be so weak , not in front of a woman , anyway . Hold on to Hubert . It 's the hunters you need . It 's hopeless , Charles . No . We 've got to save him ! Just to prove him wrong , if nothing else . Soon get Edith 's farm back now , no trouble . That 's what Charles wants , isn 't it ? Ends justify means ? It would have been Charles bleeding to death out there otherwise , sooner or later . Wasn 't room for both . Brod thinks you 've taken his place . Eh ? " Keep hold of Hubert , " he said . There 's something in that . Good idea . What are you trying to save him for ? I 've not succeeded . Good for you . ( DOGS HOWLING ) Well , what about them rats , then ? Charles will think of something . Or Hubert . Sun 's up . If we 're going to start on that farm today , we 'd better shift . No delay .

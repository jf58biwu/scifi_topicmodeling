My grandfather lived through those days . the new century coming that 's when folks began to realize that what they 'd lived through was gone . Gone forever and no going back Reynolds house . It 's the best of both worlds old fashioned but yet with all the modern conveniences . All those cupboards are real Came with the house when it was first built . True antiques . They 're lovely . Let me show you the upstairs . most people don 't want these big lovely old houses . Consider them white elephants . That 's why it 's still at this price . And where else you 're gonna find bedrooms this size ? With closets big enough to be called " rooms " ? Take your time . I love it . are you sure ? It 's gonna mean an hours train ride every morning for you to the city . It is what you wanted . we both have to want this . that 's fine with me . I want you to be happy . I want things to be the way they were . Come . It 's gonna be fine . it 's in move-in condition . new wiring and brand new paint job top to bottom . They certainly did that . They should have left it like it was . painting over this beautiful wood . What are the train connections to New York like ? Not too bad . 5 in the evening . Station sells discount tickets for commuters . Check with them . ma 'am . That 's just an old attic up here they hadn 't finished . Without electricity . Owners have come and gone but for some reason or other they never bothered to improve it . Until you decide what to do with it I wouldn 't bother going up there . How is it going ? Sickening . Noise of irregular beating my ! What 's the matter ? Nothing . You just scared me . That 's no wonder the place is giving me creeps . I heard a noise and I came up . look what I found . Look at this . this skirt ... I can 't believe it . It looks like it 's in perfect condition too . Except this little tear right here . That 's the only thing . - It 's just lovely . - You 're lovely . I 'm starving . I 'm gonna put some coals on the fire .

Did you order drinks yet ? - Bloody Mary ? - Perfect for this weather . it 's a lot of work . But it 's everything I 've ever wanted . I changed the attic around into my own private little spot . You belong in the sticks . You know ? You were never meant for this rat race . I guess I 'm a country mouse . My favorite memory when I was a child and I went to my grandparents ' farm in Ohio . I just can 't even tell you how much I loved it . it was cold and crisp and there were cows and horses ... My grandmother churned her own butter . you are romantic case . You are a throw back to an earlier age . maybe I am . - To your new life in the country . - Yes . tell me about yourself . No more down in the dumps ? this past year you could have taken a prize for grumpiness . I know I 've kind of been a pain . given the circumstances . how is Michael ? Michael is fine . Did you ever find out who that girl was ? Was it one of the students ? I don 't know and I don 't want to know . Smart . eager things are occupational hazards .

Bill was last month . well . When you and Dan come up you will see the dress . I 'll wear it for you . I guess so . Maybe I can give up a weekend on Fire Island and spend it in the farm country . And that should show how much I care about you . You get tired of those haystacks and cows okay ? Thank you . Atenuated voice from match on TV Voice from match on TV look at you ! Lovely . dance with me . wait till next time . Come dance with me . you 're standing right in front of the set . Who 's winning ? I don 't know . Michael ! When I was coming back from town I drove right out and I found myself in the middle of a street festival . It was right next to the lake . there were rides and there was a whole flea market off to the side . there were people in the lake . They were pedaling around on that little boats you pedal with your feet . It was so pretty there . The reception is crummy again . Maybe we could get the cable . I was thinking that perhaps we could go back there together . I don 't know . It 's just gorgeous . It wouldn 't take that long . right this minute ? I realize you wanna watch the game . I 'm sorry .

You should see some of the dreams that I have . This was so specific . I really felt like I was back in another century . this house ... kid . No wonder you 're dreaming about it . I suppose so . I just ... But why " Pamela " ? I don 't even know anyone named Pamela . Noise of a smashed glass - What was that ? - I don 't know . Michael ... You stay put . Michael ... you down here ? Have a look at this . my poor cupboard ! It 's the only thing broken . the doors are locked . Do you think it 's just because it was old ? I don 't see how . Glass doesn 't break just because it 's old . Looks like something 's been thrown through it . behind the doors . Watch your feet . - Where are you going ? - I 'm going to clean it up . Roars like he was fighting and she laughs loudly You 're crazy . mister . I take it all back about the country . I love this house . Dan ? I wouldn 't live in this house ' cause it 's haunted .

Maybe you have a poltergeist . - Poltergeist ? - Sure ! spirits that haunt houses and knock things off shelves and pound on the walls and things ... I know what it is .

I admit it happened . It did happen . I put my hand in the cookie jar and I got caught . But I can 't change the past so we 're gonna have to live with it and deal with it . let 's deal with it . Michael . We 're talking about trust . You broke it . Now you 're trying to put it back together with words and it isn 't working . I 'm having a hard time dealing with these pieces . I swear . I don 't even know what she looked like . Until she called I ... I don 't even know what her last name was . That 's worse ! can 't you see that ? Is that what sex is to you ? Is that all it means ? Do you have any idea who I am while we 're making love ? can you ? Michael . It really has . I feel love again . I love you as a person and because I believe in the institution of marriage I want this to work . Every time you touch me I can 't help but think that you 're not making love to me because you love me but because ... For you it 's a physical act . It 's a function that you carry out like taking a shower or jogging or something . I love you . That is not exactly what I 'm ... And I know I hurt you terribly and I 'm sorry . I will be patient . God ! Intriguing music Loud high noise look ! Principal theme : andante ( violins ) Intriguing music Barks Pamela ! Pamela ! stay ! I love you ! Pamela ! Pamela ! Come back ! Horse whicker Claxon and braking skid - How did it go ? - All right . She 'd like you to go in . sit down . I should tell you at the outset that it 's not my practice to divulge anything that was told to me by a patient . Not even to the patient 's spouse . I understand . Can you give me any idea of how serious this is ? bright . Outside of this fantasy she seems like a perfectly normal and healthy person . Did she tell you anything about my ... our life together ? Yes . Do you think that has anything to do with all this ? That 's possible but it 's really way too early to tell . Her fantasy seems to center around a man . we 'll get into that . What now ? What shall I do ? Be her husband . Be understanding . Just treat her with love and compassion . yes . There is very little I don 't know about this town . Aunt Betty used to tell me story by the hour when I was a child . She is our town 's oldest citizen . Well over a hundred and her mind wandered but she used to be a grand story teller . I was wondering if you could tell me about the house that we bought . the Reynolds House . That is one of our most interesting landmarks . an artist ? The attic is very much like an artist studio . yes . He was very talented . Studied in Paris and everything . still unknown and only one of his paintings survived . Is it possible to see that painting somewhere ? we have it right here . I 'll show it to you . David Reynolds his name was . the Harringtons . The wedding reception took place right in your front yard . the very next day when they were getting ready to go away on the honeymoon one of the horses went wild rearing out of control his bride . What was her name ? let me think . I believe it was Pamela . The story goes he went a little crazy after that claiming he saw his bride come back . He 'd be driving a buggy down the road and suddenly she 'd appear in the dress she wore the day she died . She 'd appear and before he could get close to her she 'd disappear . Shortly after that the story was he took up with some other woman . It caused quite a little scandal in taking up with her so soon after his wife 's death . So what happened ? that 's the sad thing . He was killed . It 's been an unsolved mystery to this very day . Some suspect it was the woman he took up with because she was seen leaving the scene of the crime . old man who blamed David Reynolds for the death of his daughter and challenged him to a duel . shortly after Pamela 's death on the night of the town 's turn of the century celebration they say . There . That 's the painting . Mystery music Isn 't she pretty ? You look remarkably like her . your hair in the same kind of outfit ... dear ? You 're so pale ! but so what ? We found the dress in the attic where the artist used to live . It figures . What about the woman ? There 's a slight resemblance . You put any pretty girl in that dress and there 'd be resemblance . His wife 's name was Pamela . How do you explain that ? A coincidence . What about him seeing her ghost from a buggy on the road ? It actually happened to me and Mrs. Bates couldn 't possibly have known that . You don 't know what actually happened . Stories that passed down by word of mouth for more than 75 years are bound to get distorted . So you rather think I 'm out of my mind ? that you 're some kind of backwards reincarnation ? I might as well believe in poltergeist that Beverly 's talking about . you 're creating some ideal man in your mind . Some man you can throw on my face . let 's talk about it . Let 's bring it out in the open . okay ? I was wrong and I 'm sorry and I would do anything in the world I could to undo all that and I 'm trying . But you 've got to face the fact that what this is is a kind of fleeing from reality . the move from the city was fleeing from reality . That 's what started all this . So now myto leave the city was a crazy act too . Just everything I do is crazy . It hurts me to see this happening to you . If you allow this coincidence influence your mind you 're gonna get worse . I love you . I want you to get well . Can 't you see that ? Michael . Michael thinks that I am inventing this man to get back at him for what he did to me . I 'm not . I didn 't ask for this to happen to me . I 'm not doing it . It just happens . It 's real . You told me that whenever you wear the dress it happens . Yes . Why don 't you destroy the dress ? What is the dress ? Jennie : the dress is the trigger that your subconscious uses to keep you from getting close to Michael . you 're trying to tell me that I 'm not really seeing this man that I know I am ? That is exactly what I 'm telling you . It 's an illusion of your own making . Jennie . What is reality ? What do we really know about this universe ? What do we know about time or infinity ? Somebody just found a ring around Jupiter but it was there before . Isn 't it possible that that a door has been opened to me some kind of a door to the past . Doors to the past do not open . Men walked on the moon . Real men with real boots in real machines . it was science-fiction . It was a fantasy . And now it is a fact of life . So why isn 't it possible that what 's happening to me could someday be a fact of life as well ? How can you sit there and be so ... Narrow-minded ? Mysterious music Why don 't you destroy the dress ? and you know it . You look remarkably like her . your hair in the same kind of outfit ... Loud noise Wall clock pendulum Regular noise like someone was sawing David ? David Reynolds ? Pamela ! Pamela ? please . I 'll stay if you don 't frighten me . You 're not Pamela . No . Who are you ? Jennie Logan . Jennie . where did you get it ? It was a gift . at the lake ? Yes . I thought you were a ghost . Pamela 's ghost . I thought so too . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I wasn 't Pamela . Forgive me . I 'm not being civil . May I offer you something ? Will you come into the house ? I 'm afraid I did a considerable damage . You did this ? The night after Pamela died . I couldn 't help myself . I smashed it . I was in a rage for taking her . It didn 't help . Since that first day on the road seeing you I 've lived in a kind of unreal fever . I thought maybe Pamela found the way to come back to me in whatever form the afterlife allows us . So you see I cannot be too happy to find that I was wrong . You must forgive me . You find me in a difficult time . There 's nothing to forgive you for . I I came because ... because I chose to . I 'm glad you did . So am I. A horse neighs Next time my aim will be more accurate ! He shoots in the air who are they ? Detectives . Hired by my wife 's father . The man 's demented . He thinks I killed Pamela for her inheritance and he 's hired an agency to seek evidence . I 've tried to convince him I loved his daughter . He can keep his inheritance . But he 's adamant . He won 't rest till he sees me punished . You 're very pale . Are you all right ? I don 't feel well . I 'd better go . - Can I get you something ? - No . I have to go . please . I 'm sorry . I can 't explain it but I have to go alone . Please . Wait a moment . Principal theme : andante ( violin ) Today has been the nicest day I 've spent in some time . For which you bear a small responsibility . don 't follow me . I won 't follow . Loud noise Principal theme : andante ( violin ) Principal theme : andante ( piano ) there ! - Good morning . - Good morning . you did come back . I see you 've made a friend . He 's a good dog . What 's his name ? I call him . Very old Napoleon . Come on . - May I see your sketch ? - Of course . It 's lovely . lovely . David . I 've decided that you 've been alone quite long enough . So I 've come to call . I hope I 'm not intruding . Elizabeth . You know how your father feels about me . Hello . I 'm Elizabeth Harrington Edward Hartley . Forgive me . May I introduce Ms. Jennie Logan ? Elizabeth . Your father has detectives spread all over the place . I 'm sure you 'll be in the reports this evening . If that 's the case then the damage has been done . So let 's have an enjoyable afternoon . As we always used to . Edward . We 've brought lunch . I hope you don 't mind . It 's quite nice . We got it at Bradley 's . Ms. Logan . sliced ham and some fine Gruyere . Buns from Langstraat and two bottles of very cold wine . I 'm sure there 's enough for four . We pretend not to like the summer trade but actually we thrive on it . Ms. Logan but I do miss it . Do you have plans to return soon ? My plans are indefinite . I used to be Ms. Logan . That is before my baby sister came back from finishing school and snatched him right from under my nose . please ! Sorry . must we ? - She 's very beautiful . - Yes . you know . Poor Elizabeth . I think she feels there was more between us than actually existed . She 's jealous of you . She has reason to be . I 'd better go . Will you come tomorrow ? Will you wear that dress ? I wanna sketch you . Let me drive you home . I 'll be all right . I won 't have you walking there alone . you can 't . My ... husband won 't understand . - So it 's " Mrs. Logan " . - Yes . Why did you come here ? Why did you let me believe you weren 't married ? Can 't you guess what it does to me to see you standing there resembling Pamela ? Principal theme : andante ( flute ) No . No . It 's not just because you look like Pamela . forgive me . You 've made me forget her . There 's something magical about you . I 've only known you two days I hardly know anything about you but I feel as though I 've known you for years as though I 've loved you for years . A horse approaches in trot I see you have quickly forgotten . What little grief might have been expected from such a man as yourself ? But what 's done is done . I will answer to my maker for that mistake but there is something I can do . I understand that you are paying court to my daughter Elizabeth . Reynolds : until the wheels of justice put a proper end to your villainy you stay away from me and mine I will kill you . Intriguing music I will kill you ! What are you doing ? Some glass from the old cupboard . I thought I 'd save it . It 's just so old ... You kissed the glass . That 's a very strange thing to do . something to do with the glass ? so I can help you . Help me ? You 're trying to convince me I 'm insane and I 'm not . It 's true ! Everything Mrs. Bates told me . I went back . David Reynolds and I spoke to him . He is a delusion you 've idealized in that romantic head of yours . No . I can 't compete with knights in white charges I 'm just an ordinary guy . yeah . A normal person who can 't even allow the possibility because it isn 't happening to you is real . You can go off and go to bed with somebody you don 't even know her name . okay ? Jennie I think we ought to go away for a while . we 'll take a vacation . I don 't wanna go anywhere with you . Are you mad at me because I 'm not caught up in your fantasy ? I just don 't want a vacation . All right . Then why don 't you go to Fire Island ? I 'm sure Beverly will love to have you there . You wouldn 't mind me going alone ? I think it 's necessary for you to get away from this place . Michael . forgive me . Principal theme : andante ( violins ) Look out ! You better get out of that dress . let me help you . What 's wrong ? I 'll dry soon . It 's fine . Nonsense . You 'll catch your death . don 't . No . You look lovely . Even wet . I 'll take it off myself . I 'll go fix us something hot to drink . What 's wrong ? All day I 've noticed that look in your eyes . Are you worried about your husband ? it 's not my husband . who then ? It 's Mr. Harrington . He hates you . He truly means to harm you . Don 't worry . I doubt he is as dangerous as he sounds . He wouldn 't resort to violence . There 's so little time left . We have a world of time ahead us . Mrs. Bates is there anything else you can tell me about it at all ? I 'm afraid not . We can 't be sure it actually took place . It 's just a story that 's come down through the years . Some say it was the duel what killed him . Others say it was the woman who he took up with who disappeared right after the murder and was never seen or heard of again . And it took place on the night of the turn of the century celebration ? Yes . Sometime after the ball which would have been around midnight . we do have Mr. Harrington dueling pistols in the memorabilia annex if you care to see them . It 's around the corner . Old John will help you . Thank you . aren 't they ? You wouldn 't think they 'd have trusted such antiquated pieces . After all at the turn of the century it was pretty advanced as far as fire arms are concerned . These are the actual pistols they fought with ? no . That 's rumored to be . We just know that they came from the Harrington mansion . They used to sit on a little corner table in the game-room by the big fireplace . I doubt the whole story . Why ? Why ? if I wanted to kill somebody I certainly wouldn 't trust my luck to some 18th century gunsmith . These pistols are unreliable . What do you mean ? I don 't understand . do you ? Let me show you . Now look : on both of these weapons this front side is movable . left or right that throws your aim off by yards . How ugly . I never could stand the sight of guns . Mrs. Bates last week you spoke to me about your aunt . You said that she was very old and that her mind wanders and everything . but I wonder if she might know more . you mean aunt Betty . she 's not really my aunt . Her real name is Betty Wilkins but she 's given so much of herself in helping people of this town that everyone calls her " aunt Betty " . Do you think that I might speak to her about the Reynolds story . she 's quite senile now and I 'm afraid it would do no good . let 's try . I brought you a visitor . This is Mrs. Logan . I 've been telling her about you . She so wanted to meet you . She 's interested in Chesapeakeuan history too . I 'm very pleased to meet you . She 's interested in the Reynolds story . How his wife was killed and he claimed he saw her ghost come back and then how he was murdered and nobody ever found out who did it . try and remember . It 's the David Reynolds story . Do you remember that story ? I 'm ... I 'm sorry . you 'll have to leave . This happens when she 's upset . it 's lovely . It 's really lovely . It 's hand-painted . I thought you might wear it with your white dress . I 'll wear it always . Always . Remember that camping trip to Big Surf ? All rain and rain from day one . Wet clothes wet sleeping bag The wood 0000 Now I wouldn 't trade that memory for anything . Think about those days a lot . I was very happy . Do you want some more wine ? thank you . is that it ? you 're not helping by doing this . How about helping me for a change ? I 'm not made of stone . Do you know how long it 's been since we 've made love . Since you 've allowed me to touch you ? You don 't care about me or how I feel or what you 're doing to us . All you care about is this dream man of yours . Jen ! Jennie ! Jennie . open the door . Damn it . Will you open the door ? open the door and talk to me . Michael and I 'm sorry I 'm making you unhappy but I guess it has to be this way for a little while . I 'll sleep in the attic . 10 - It 's all right . - David ! It 's all right . It 's a dream . David . - Come here . What 's wrong ? Do you believe in immortality ? I don 't know . I can 't imagine a heaven that wouldn 't have trees and fields and oceans just like the Earth . Whenever I 'm involved in a genuinely creative act I feel I 'm part of something larger than myself . That I 'm expressing part of some immortal creative force we 've come to call God . I feel that when I make love to you . I think that 's what the phrase let your acts glorify God " really means . When you act out of love creatively you express part of that immortal force . I 'm working on a painting that gives me that feeling I still need to touch it too but I want you to see it . will you leave your husband ? Will you come away with me ? I know it 's sudden but I scent you are like me . Amsterdam . Please I need you . More than he does . You don 't love him . No . I did . I 'll go anywhere you want tonight . David ? David ? You 're home after all . Were you working ? Elizabeth . David ? You 've never seem so distant before . Don 't you honestly understand the situation I 'm in with your father ? I only understand that I love you . I always have and I always will . Hello . I seem to be intruding again . You must tell me when you have guests I 'll stay away . for your sake and for mine I must insist that you leave . Elizabeth . please ! I said wait outside . Reynolds but apparently there 's only one language that a man like you understands . Tomorrow night this town will celebrate the coming of a new century . it 'll be a double celebration . For tomorrow night I will kill you . I implore you . Reynolds : after the ball my pistols and I shall be at your service . And if there 's any shred of honor left in you I expect to see you then . let 's go away tonight . I 'll go with you anywhere . Jennie . - David ! - It 's senseless . If he means to duel me no power on Earth will stop him . God . - Hi . - Hi . I 'd like to go again to Fire Island tomorrow if it 's all right with you . It 's okay . But I 'll miss you . I worry about you . Don 't worry about me . I 'll be all right no matter what happens . What is happening ? don 't make me hurt you . Tell me . Let me worry about the hurt . I think I have a right to know . I 'm in love with David Reynolds and he is in love with me . he isn 't real . he is . He is . I 'm a part of his life . He 's asked me to go away with him to Paris but he 's gonna be killed if I can 't stop it . But I 'm going back . I 've seen the start and I can see it coming . There 's gonna be a duel between David and Mr. Harrington . — that is Pamela 's father — and unless I can find some way to stop it this Mr. Harrington is going to kill him . You don 't believe a word I 've been saying . I believe that you believe it . I belong there . I don 't wanna live here in this time anymore . I feel warm there by the way the world was then the kind of life I could have with him I wanna have his children I wanna grow old with him . I love him . You can 't go away with him . he 's already dead . But couldn 't he survive someway ? If the past still exists right now and I can go to him couldn 't I change what 's gonna happen ? I love you . I don 't want you to go away from me . I know you do . I know . And I 'm sorry you have to go through this . I don 't understand it but if it 's meant to happen to me it must be meant to happen to you too . Can 't you see that ? But how will I even know what happens to you if you went away with him . If you just disappear I 'll never know from you again . I 'll find a way . I promise you I will find some way to get through and let you know . It 's possible to break through the barriers of time and space . Michael . David did the night he broke the cupboard downstairs . But I belong there and I belong with him . And if I can 't find some way to save his life and being with him I just don 't think I wanna live either . Why did you wait all day to call me ? I don 't like all this talk about her not wanting to live if he dies . but the human mind is capable of willing itself to die . What does that mean ? That means that I think that she should be hospitalized in order to keep her from doing herself harm . do you know where she is ? She dropped me off at the train and she drove to Fire Island . I want you to go and I want you to find her and I want you to stay with her and I don 't want her to be alone . And I want you to call me immediately . Waltz music David . A toast . For the new century . Thank you . Have you seen any sign of Jennie Logan ? No . Nor of Elizabeth or her father . Father ! You promised to help me fetch my case in the attic . We 're dreadfully late . all right . Waltz music your dress is charming ! my dear . Applause I 'm worried . Let 's go away now . There 's nothing to be worried about . Look at him over there . He hardly seems so formidable tonight nor is he bristling with weapons . I 'm sure he spoke out of pain and temper . No . He inteds to kill you . how can you possibly know what he 's going to do ? I do know . Waltz music Dance with me . Elizabeth ? Elizabeth ? Stop worrying . Let 's enjoy ourselves . Principal theme : waltz ( piano ) Some say it was the duel what killed him others say it was the woman who he took up with . I have to leave . - What ? - I have to leave . Why can 't you stay ? I don 't want you to go away ever again . We 're going away together . We will . I must leave you now for just a little while . allow me this . Please . When will you be back ? Soon . Soon . I promise . I love you . I love you . Telephone Hello . I 've been trying to reach you all day . I really haven 't any time right now . You must come to aunt Betty 's immediately . Though the doctor 's with her she 's not expected to last the night . She showed me something that 's shocking . What is it ? I can 't discuss it on the phone . You must come here at once . It concerns the murder of David Reynolds . I 'll be right there . It was in her trunk . She made me search for it and insisted that you see it . I had no idea . All these years she kept her true identity a secret . Aunt Betty . Elizabeth . Are you Elizabeth Harrington ? Yes . It 's true . After David 's death I left my father 's house many years . I returned only after my father 's death but not as a Harrington . Never again as a Harrington . I could never return to that life or to that house with the memory of what I 'd done . What do you mean ? It was I who killed David Reynolds . After you left the ball I sought out David . I had to tell him of my feelings . I may have expected his anger but never his cruelty . Elizabeth . Your persistence is useless . It can only serve to make your father more irrational than he already is . understand once and for all that your feelings for me are not returned . there never will be . Even if I weren 't in love with Jennie Logan I would not want you . I hated him . I hated him and I wished him dead . I knew what I had to do . I even took a pistol with me in order to stop it but at that moment I had no intention of stopping it . I hid behind a tree and I watched them as they walk off the distance . There would be no chance of David surviving for if my father missed I would not . where did they duel ? behind the band 's tent . - What time did the duel take place ? - Just before midnight .

He that believeth in me yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth And though this body be destroyed yet shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not as a stranger .

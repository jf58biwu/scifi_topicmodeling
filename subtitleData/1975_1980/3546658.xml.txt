 - Any idea what this one 's about , Joe ? - Ours is not to reason why . Ours but to answer when called . - Good morning . - Good morning , sir . The is the final transmission of Naval Lt. Comdr. Mansfield ... While flying over Quadrant Four . Mayday ! Tower , I ... Instruments , vibrations ... terrific heat . I 'm out of control ! It 's ... I don 't know ! Help ! Quadrant Four . That 's in the Bermuda Triangle . Of which Lt. Comdr. Mansfield is now another statistic . You all know the area 's reputation for strange phenomena . The Devil 's Triangle . We now feel , however ... that recent incidents were deliberately created ... to enhance its mystique . For the express purpose of stopping our Operation Sea Harvest . - Stop a pilot program for farming the sea ? - Subterfuge . To cover the establishment ... of an advanced type ofnuclear breeder test station here . Longitude 30ยบ 22 ' degrees ... latitude 64ยบ 47 ' degrees ... where there are no inhabited islands in case of a mishap . Diana ? Something troubling you ? It 's an awesome thought . - Something could go wrong . - But necessary , sir . If we 're to maintain our country 's defense . Well said , Atkinson . Our sources are now convinced that the test facility ... is in danger ofbeing sabotaged by this man . Raymond Manta . As dangerous as the manta ray . - No stranger to the intelligence sector . - Right , sir . The head of I.C.O.P.E. International Confederation of the Power Elite . We suspect he 's behind the trouble in the Triangle . - We 'll get on it at once , sir . - Carry on . We 'll need a cover , Joe . How about a couple of rich swingers ? Jet-setters on vacation . Crazy rich . Steve , you are checked on those small jet jobs , are you not ? - Sure . - We 're gonna have to get you outfitted . Especially you , Diana . Diana , I certainly didn 't mean to imply that you aren 't a swinger . Well I mean that you ... You won 't have to do anything , Diana . We all know that you 're a girl of proper values . Joe , this is not the first time we 've gone undercover . Of course , I 'm gonna need receipts for accounting , Steve . - Have I ever failed accounting ? - No . But according to your record , you 're wanting in math . You got a C-minus in high school algebra . It was a C. Come on now . What 's the problem ? I know when something is bothering you . Well , it 's just that any kind of nuclear testing facility is dangerous . That 's why they 're putting it way out in the middle of nowhere ... away from people . - It 'll be all right . - Right . - 12 : 00 noon sharp , okay ? - 12 : 00 noon sharp . You wanted to speak with me , Diana ? Yes , Mother , I have to speak with you . I 'm being sent on a mission ... to arrest an international criminal named Raymond Manta . Well , that 's part of your duty , isn 't it ? And you have the power of Wonder Woman to accomplish it . Yes . But he 's operating within the Bermuda Triangle . And if we stop him ... America will build a nuclear experimental facility ... only a few miles from Paradise Island . They feel it 's the perfect place because there 's no one there to hurt . Of course , they don 't know of us . And if there was an accident , then Paradise Island would be destroyed . You went out into the outer world to help protect it . And joined the agency as the best means to accomplish that end . Yes . You have sworn allegiance to your new friends . - Yes . - You cannot go back on your pledge . It would be unworthy of you . Amazons have lived on Paradise Island for thousands of years ... at one with the land and the universe . And now my daughter is faced with a choice : to betray her word ... which would destroy her ... or to do what she must , which could destroy us . No one is wiser than you , Mother . There must be a way ! Alas , my wisdom does not extend to worldly dilemmas . In times of trouble I can only turn to Amazonian philosophy . " When you see the heart of darkness ... " you will begin to perceive the light . " I 'm not sure that I understand . In time , all will be clear to you . Well , we 're into the Triangle now , Diana . I always find it so beautiful . The sea , the islands . If we were anybody else , we 'd probably be getting a little edgy right about now . Waiting for some strange phenomenon to happen . As a matter of fact , I lost a couple of days here myself not long ago . Manta does his work well . - It seems incredible . - That one man could really do it ? Create enough incidents to make people afraid of a whole area . Well , I guess that 's what we 'll find out . This just came in , sir . I know these two . A private plane . Locate this jet at once . Intruders . But welcome intruders . I.A.D.C. Inter-Amateur Defense Command . I went over Manta 's dossier again . There 's no limit to what he can do . His organization includes some of the most powerful men in the world . They 're international pirates creating a war ... sinking a country 's economy and getting fatter for every disaster . Wherever you have human misery , you can find Manta 's hand . I wonder how long he has been operating in the Triangle . You know , years ago , my father crash-landed somewhere around here . If Manta was behind that ... maybe I 'll get the chance to even the score . Target approaching , sir . What are you waiting for ? Add another mystery to the Bermuda Triangle . - Use the lighthouse to bring them down . - Yes , sir . - Steve , what is it ? - I don 't know . - I 'm losing control . - There 's nothing in sight ! Trevor to Atkinson . - Come in , Washington . - Go ahead , Steve . Joe , I 'm over Quadrant Four . I 'm having some trouble . I 'm losing control . Can you hear that noise ? That 's the same sound we heard over Mansfield 's transmission . What is it ? Diana , Joe . I don 't know . The sky is clear . There 's no wind velocity . But we 're experiencing extraordinary turbulence . There 's not supposed to be any weather at all . - Can it be I.C.O.P.E. ? - You see anything ? - Negative . - But it 's getting very hot in here . More power . The Devil 's Triangle . Atkinson , I just wish you were on that jet , too . That 's it , we 've lost all power . The heat is unbearable . It 's some invisible something , Joe . A ray , something . We 'd better bail out , Steve . Trevor ! Diana ! Come in ! Mayday ! We 're bailing out ! Bail out ? Steve , Diana ? Can you read me ? Come in ! I want a secure line immediately . Top secret , high priority . Yes , he went to Camp David this morning . Diana , you okay ? Yeah , I guess I 'm all right . Thank goodness you got me out of that tree . - What tree ? - That tree . You 're kidding . Must have done it by reflex , then passed out myself . How did I do that ? I don 't know , but three cheers for your reflexes . Probably the only lucky thing that ever happened in the Devil 's Triangle . Well , we 'd better get rid of these parachutes , just in case . Good idea . - Come on , soup 's on . - Not yet . I catch them , you 're supposed to cook them , that 's the deal . I know but the parachute string and your penknife ... aren 't exactly a seamstress ' delight . There . - The jungle look . - Not bad . Steve , what kind of a weapon do you think could ... send us out of control like that ? It 's not much of a trick to knock out jet engines with micro sound waves ... but I 've never seen or heard of equipment that powerful . A weapon like that . Out here . The Agency 's got to know . Out where ? We went off course when the vibrations hit us . Where we are now is anybody 's guess . They 'd never find out about that weapon from us . Could be here for the duration . The bad part is that ... with us disappearing like that , the government may decide ... to forget about putting that nuclear plant in the Triangle altogether . Come on , let 's go . I 'm famished . Wait a minute , your country 's armament supremacy ... is threatened by an international criminal , and you 're hungry ? - We gotta eat . - My thinking , exactly . I 'm starving . Come on , let 's go . Grab my shirt . We 've landed right in the lion 's den . They found our parachutes . Now that they know we 're here , we may as well know where they are . Come on . - Radio , radar , get a load of that . - Manta goes first class . I 'd like to sit up on that ridge with a few mortar rounds . I 'd give him first class . I 'll settle for getting out of here and letting Atkinson send a destroyer . Must be their radio shack . Any way of getting a message out ? What message ? Come and get us ? We don 't know where we are for sure . If you can tie down the key , that 'll send out a constant signal . - Maybe our people would pick it up . - That 's a good idea . Maybe I can do something with the wires . I 'll go scout the beach . There 's gotta be a boat around , right ? - All right , be careful . - Okay . There , that 'll send out a constant signal . I.C.O.P.E. will think the key is dead . Should be a long time before they discover otherwise . By which time we 'll be long gone . Steve , I 've located a boat . - Our ticket out of here . - All right ! It 's Mansfield . The young Navy pilot from the transmission we heard . Steve , he 's alive . Keep him walking . He must exercise . They 're treating him like an animal . - Poor guy 's just a shell . - We can 't leave him here . We can 't . - How do I look ? - Boy , it 's not going to be easy . At least I 'm a major , we 've got a little rank . Let 's go . Sergeant . My jeep ready ? - I beg your pardon , sir ? - My jeep . It was to be ready at 1900 hours . It is now 1900 hours . Maj. Smith , I got my own driver . - Anything wrong , Sergeant ? - No , sir . I mean , I wasn 't informed . Don 't tell me you weren 't informed . Manta made that call himself . Maybe he talked to Harris . It 's not on the schedule . Your name again , sir ? You are not supposed to know me . International Security , Interrogations . - Yes , sir . - All right . I 'm taking the prisoner , Mansfield , into the jungle for questioning . - Far into the jungle , get the picture ? - Yes , sir . Manta told me you were one of his most trusted men . There are those among us who are counterproductive , follow ? After I deal with Mansfield , it will be my job to determine who those men are . - Can I count on your support ? - Yes , sir . Take that ! I 'll need a report on every man in your section . Have it ready by 0600 tomorrow morning . - Is that clear ? - Yes , sir . Sergeant , why are you staring at my driver ? It 's just he 's got a funny build on him , sir . That happens to be the regimental karate champion . I wouldn 't say that to his face . Carry on . You men are dismissed . I 'll take over from here . Don 't be afraid , we 're friends . I want you to get into the jeep . Lt. Comdr. Mansfield , Robert . U.S ... 974 ... - Sergeant ! - Hit it ! Let 's go . Jump into that jeep and let 's follow after them . - Come on . Step on it . - You 're not going to believe this . - Get moving , would you ! - We 're out of gas . That 's not funny , Diana . Good evening , Joe . You received my message about Diana and Steve missing in action ? Yes . I was deeply saddened and it 's a great loss to the agency . I now have reason to believe they 're still alive . Alive ? Explain . We are receiving a constant signal ... from the area in the Bermuda Triangle near where they bailed out . But you can 't be certain it 's Steve and Diana ? No , I 'm not certain , not really . But there 's a chance . It 's a radio signal where no radio signal should be : from an island we thought unpopulated . Meaning a covert operation , meaning ... I.C.O.P.E. That would be a good guess , sir . If Prince and Trevor landed on that island ... it 's possible they found a way to turn Manta 's resources against him . I gather you want to organize a search party . A search force , sir . The destroyer Jefferson is on maneuvers in that area . I 'd like to cut orders to send her right into Manta 's lap . And , sir , I request permission to lead the operation . Your project has a go , Atkinson . Top priority . But I 'm afraid you 'll have to stay . Sorry , Joe . If Diana and Steve are there , we 'll get them out . NASA should be so well-equipped . Electronic schematics . I wonder what kind of weapon he 's dreamed up now . I call it the Sting Ray . It 's a computerized underwater weapon capable of enormous destructive power . It cannot be stopped . It 's a minor achievement of mine . We 've encountered some of your major and ... even more destructive ones . Name , rank , and serial number . We 're not going to be so formal now , are we , Trevor ? - You know me ? - Yes . And Ms. Diana Prince , your associate . I know a great deal about the Inter-Agency Defense Command . Tell me , that old warhorse , Atkinson ... he 's still with the organization , isn 't he ? Don 't bother to lie . I heard his voice before I pulled the plug on you . When are they going to turn him out to pasture ? Joe Atkinson will be around long after you 're in the federal pen ... or a padded cell , Manta . You know , about one week ago ... he had the same naive American arrogance . Let 's put our cards on the table . I know a great deal about you . You know a great deal about me . We know you sabotaged Operation Sea Harvest ! Yes ! The Triangle is mine ! I traded on its reputation and added a few tricks of my own . I need a base of operations . You and everyone else who ever wanted to rule the world . - Rule the world ? - Yes . The world is perfect for my needs just as it is . I couldn 't improve it . Countries talk of international goodwill , then conspire against each other . Me , I am just a simple profiteer . I go to one country and I say : " Look , your neighbor 's got a gun . " And I sell him a cannon . Then I go to the first country - And you say , " Your neighbors have a cannon . " - And you sell them a bomb . - Yes ! Isn 't it glorious ? And then after they blow each other half out of existence , I sell them food . For famine always follows war . And medicine , for disease always follows famine . War , pestilence , famine and disease . No , the world is perfect just as it is . I wouldn 't change a hair . I love it ! - You 're a madman ! - Thank you . All great men are called something like that . - Why the lecture in political science ? - Good question . Why did I convince you of anything ? Why not just gain what information I can get from you , as I will from Mansfield . Because I need you . That 's why . The I.A.D.C. is the greatest single obstacle to my continuing success . I know a great deal about your agency , as you can tell . But there 's nothing like first-hand information . You 're talking about betraying our country . Your people are playing cops and robbers with me . It might be profitable to find out where the cops are . Profitable for us both . Manta , there is a lady present ... or I would tell you precisely what you can do with your proposition . Let me tell him ! Unidentified vessel heading into Triangle , sir . That of course would be Atkinson ... so predictable in his own way , sending a man-of-war . Charming . Activate the Sting Ray . Yes , sir . Estimated time of intercept , 0630 hours , sir . Tomorrow morning . How fitting . You have until then to reconsider my offer . And don 't think the U.S. Navy is going to bail you out . The Sting Ray is an electronic Wunderkind ... and has a kill capacity by air or sea . Sleep tight . And after the Navy , there 'll be another force , and another . America will never bow down to you . Get them out of here . Wait for him to fall asleep , and you 'll have a long , gray beard . It was just a thought , I 'm open to better suggestions . Yes , I told you before . Come on , it 'll never work . It 's so old . We don 't exactly have a choice , do we ? Okay , whose turn is it ? Well , I think a woman might be more convincing . Let 's go . We 'll be all right . Don 't worry , we 'll get out of this . No , I can 't stand it anymore ! - Get a hold of yourself , Diana . - No , I don 't care ! - Don 't do it ! - He 's got us ! He 'll kill us ! I 'll do whatever he wants ! Take me to Manta . - What 's the matter ? - Take me to him ! You can 't break now and give him what he wants . Let go ! I 'll talk , I 'll say whatever he wants . - I 'll tell him everything . - What 's the matter with you ? - Think what you 're doing . - No ! - I want to live ! - Harry . I told you it wouldn 't work , didn 't I ? Limpet mines . What in blazes ? Fire ! What happened ? - Manta , sir . - Out with it ! There was a woman at the dock . She was dressed up in a costume . And so we fired , but she caught the bullets ... or deflected them or something . Describe this costume . It was red , white and blue ... with stars and some sort of golden belt around her waist . Go on . She came toward us and we were afraid . - Please , sir ! - Stop . - It was Wonder Woman . - Wonder Woman ? Yes , I thought she was a legend or a fantasy ... what have you . It doesn 't matter who or what she is . Whatever her plan , she will never arrive in time . That Sting Ray is going to rendezvous with the destroyer at any time now . She will be too late to save them , won 't she ? Far too late . The Bermuda Triangle myth will be perpetuated once more . Trevor , come , good morning . I wouldn 't want you to miss the show . Where 's Diana ? What have you done with her ? Six thousand yards , sir . This may not be Mandalay , but the dawn will come up like thunder . I asked you a question . - Activate the nuclear warhead . - Yes , sir . Nero fiddled . You sing . Yes , but Nero 's world was a single city , while mine , well ... You just can 't learn to think big , Trevor . Forty-five hundred yards , sir . Bored , Trevor ? - Accelerate the Sting Ray . - Yes , sir . General quarters . All hands man your battle stations . Sonar reports unidentified enemy submarine approaching . Ready to join a winning team , Trevor ? That 's so stupid . You 've joined the losing team . And the penalty , I assure you , will be most unpleasant . Watch the finale . That 's impossible . - It 's Wonder Woman . - That 's impossible ! - Impossible ! - It 's possible . All gun crew , remain on battle stations . Men , set up defenses . Hold out for as long as you can ... then fall back to the boat and head for Base Two . I 'll meet you there . - The fight is over , Manta ! - You think it 's over . - I 'm not finished yet . - I 'm not going to debate with you . You 're only prolonging the agony . But have it your way . All I want from you now is to know whether Diana is alive or dead . That 's of no consequence to me . Because one hour from now ... she will be where all your people will be , and all my people too . Blown to kingdom come ! What are you talking about ? See for yourself . Those switches . You 've rigged the building to self destruct . The building ? This whole island ! Your men will land , and my men will keep them busy . Until one hour from now . Manta , if it were anyone else I 'd be surprised , even stunned . But you , you 're running true to form . Do you think I 'd let this ... the product of my genius , fall into enemy hands ? You may have won this battle ... and it may take me years to rebuild again somewhere else . But it will cost your people , cost them dearly . Now move . - Where ? - To a secret cove where I keep a boat . Then we 'll take a little sail off to an island ... where we can watch the big boom . And in case I encounter resistance along the way ... you will do very nicely for a hostage , thank you very much . - I 'm not going anywhere . - Yes , you are . Because as long as you 're alive , you think you 'll have a chance ... to overpower me and save that girl . But dead , you can do nothing . After you . Drive . First of all , you 're going to take me to Diana . And then ... This is the Captain speaking . All boarding parties prepare to disembark upon reaching I. C.O.P.E. harbor . Step on it ! I won 't hesitate to use this . As a matter of fact , I 'd rather enjoy it . Wonder Woman , how did you know ? Steve , I just followed my mother 's advice . She said when you see the heart of darkness ... - you will then perceive the light . - I don 't quite follow . - Call it intuition . - That 's good enough for me . Ask him what he did with Diana . She 's all right , Steve . I found her back on the trail ... - just before I saw you and Manta . - That 's good news . Now for the bad . Manta 's got this island rigged to blow up . It 's going to self-destruct in less than 35 minutes . How do we stop it ? It 's a doomsday device . There 's nothing I can do . That gives us less than a half hour to get Diana ... free Comdr. Mansfield , convince Manta 's men to give up ... and hope the Navy gets here in time to evacuate us . You 'll never make it . First squad , secure the beach area . Second and third squads , move inland , on the double . Congratulations on your escape . This is a replay of the explosion you witnessed ... from the deck of the destroyer Jefferson . Because of the resulting fissures in the ocean floor ... We 've been forced to abandon ... our experimental program in the Bermuda Triangle . Aside from that , it was an excellent job all around . Thank you , sir . We had a little help from Wonder Woman . As we 'd say down home , you can 't beat her with a switch . I 'll go along with that , sir . Well , I just wanted to welcome you all back home . - Thank you , sir . - Carry on . Yes , sir . I 'm delighted to inform you that ... Mansfield is in the hospital and doing fine . And Manta is in jail where he belongs . I would have led the operation but he wouldn 't let me . There were times when we really needed you , Joe . I was with you in spirit . You know that . - More than that , you sent the Navy . - It was your plan . That 's right , it was . You know , I sure wish I could find a way ... to send Wonder Woman on some of these assignments . Don 't worry about it , Joe . I 'm sure you 'll find a way . I 'm sure Wonder Woman will find a way .

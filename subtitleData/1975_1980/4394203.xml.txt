 'Why should I hide ? Why should I hide ? 'Why should I hide ? Why should I ... ' 'Come on ! Find it , its real shape . Let 's see it . ' Let 's see it ! Sapphire ? I 'm sorry , I can 't do any more . There was a barrier . I 'm sorry . You 're sorry ? ! What do you mean ? You almost had it . It was ... It ... Well , at least we know what it is . We haven 't seen it but we know what it is so let 's try and find it . Well , come on . Whatever you did , you certainly caused havoc . In every photograph there ever was . Well , who is he in this one ? Him ? Him ? Him ? No , they have their own faces . The figure we 're looking for will always be half-seen or turned away like that , or not even seen at all . What about that one ? Could be behind the fence or in the street beyond or in the next room . - But always in there somewhere ? - Yes . So every photograph is a photograph of infinity . See , saw , sacradown ... Which is the way to London town ? 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Mercury , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' Paper bubbles . Paper parasols . Paper children ? The photograph , it ... 'Look behind you . ' 'Not yet . Tell me what you see . ' 'What I see ? I see the same as you see ... ' 'Describe his face . ' 'Well , it 's a youngish face , dark hair , narrow eyes , pointed chin ... ' 'That 's not the face I 'm looking at . 'Where are you going ? ' 'You stay there . Watch him . I 'm going to take a closer look . ' 'Excuse me ... 'would you prefer us to communicate in this way ? ' 'It doesn 't make much difference to me . 'So I 'll tell you what I 'll do ... ' 'I 'll let you choose . How 's that ? ' All right , let 's communicate like this , shall we ? Why not ? - With our true voices . - Fine . And our true faces ? These are ours . The only ones we possess , I 'm afraid . - How about you ? - Me ? Yes . Well , we 'd like to see your true face . The real one . I 'm afraid this one will just have to do . No , it won 't , not for us . But then again , maybe you don 't have a real face - not the human kind . Am I right ? I mean , you have millions to choose from , don 't you ? But we 'd really like to see what you look like ... before we send you back where you came from . Oh , that can 't be done . Oh , it can . That 's our job . That 's why we 're here . Tell me about the children . Why do you need them ? Why have you brought them back with you ? - And the people . - People ? Yes , the man and the woman . They belong in this time , in this period . - Not in a photograph chosen by you . - So ? So , before we get rid of you , we 'd like them returned . Well , perhaps you could tell them that . - What ? - Yes ... when you join them . What do you mean , " join them " ? You 'll find out ... later . # I 'm the king of the castle , get down , you dirty rascal # He 's here . - Now where ? - There . - He must be somewhere . - Don 't you mean " anywhere " ? If he can disappear into photographs like some tunnel system ... We can 't follow him into that thing . What 's wrong ? " When you join them . " I wonder what he meant by that . All right , we 'll destroy every photograph in the place . Well , why not ? Remember the house ? It got into a picture and we destroyed all the pictures . That was one painting in one house . This is the whole process , the entire art of photography . Can you destroy every photograph in the world ? - You still here ? - Elizabeth Owen ? - How d 'you know that ? - Look at this . How did you know that ? I haven 't used that name for years . - Look at this photograph . - Liz Duprey . That 's my name . - That 's been my name for ... - The photograph . What about it ? It 's just a photo . There 's hundreds like it here . - I 'm late for work . - Look closely at it . Yeah , very nice . - Your friend , Ruth Phillips . - I never told you her name . - She shared a room with you ? - Course she did . - Until a few months ago ? - Yes , I 've told you that . Can you see her in the photograph ? See her in it ? In that thing ? ! How can I see her ? That thing must be a thousand years old . - 87 . - What ? It 's exactly 87 years old , give or take a week . The building at the far end of the street . The top floor , in the window . I 'm not sure . I mean , it could be anybody . Here . All right , so it looks a bit like her . - Same shaped face . - It is Ruth . - If this picture 's 80 years old ... - Look . - I said look there . - What am I looking for this time ? Just look . - I don 't believe it . Him . - Williamson ? - Your previous landlord ? - Yeah . Who disappeared about the same time as Ruth ? One ... two . Wait a minute . Anyone can play tricks with a photo . They can , yes . Especially if they know what they 're doing , if they 're professional . And he was . Mr Williamson was . He probably did that - faked that thing . - Why ? Listen , would you mind ... - It was his job , his hobby . I have to work - ' Sapphire ... ' - to concentrate , so would you mind ? Would I what ? Listen , you 're not the only one who has to work . Liz ... will you come with me ? I need your help . Is Ruth interested in photography ? Oh , yeah . But she couldn 't take a picture to save her life . She likes watching , though , seeing how it 's done . She used to spend hours in the darkroom with Williamson . Hours and hours just watching him work . Used to fascinate her . It 's only a cellar . Have you finished with me yet ? Was Ruth in the darkroom that night ? - What night ? - The night she disappeared . Look , no one 's proved she 's disappeared . I don 't know , I suppose she must have been . She never took her coat so I doubt she went out . Yeah , I suppose she must have been there . Mr Williamson ... what did he do ? Do ? Yeah . Well , he must have done something wrong . - Accidentally , yes . - So what was it ? Something to do with his photography ? Yes , he let something in . In where ? In the house ? What ? Just what are you talking about ? We 're hoping Ruth can tell us - when we talk to her . If you reckon Ruth is stuck in some picture , - then how are you gonna talk to her ? - You 'll see . Nobody can talk to a photograph and get an answer . It 's not locked , just jammed . Something I do happen to know . I 've spent half my lifetime making quick exits . How about you ? Back yard . OK ? Here , that 's funny . Where 's the kids ? Aah , they must have gone . Oh , what a shame . They bring a bit of life into the place , playing their games . Skipping and that , singing their funny songs . Do you know what 's funny ? I used to think they were foreign or something . Or from the country . Their songs always seemed sort of old - sort of old-fashioned , do you know what I mean ? Yes . It 's funny , though , I 've never seen their parents . No one comes to look for them and take them in . They 're out here till all hours and no one gets them . Anyway , they 're definitely not here now . Oh , there they are . They must have been hiding . Here , what 's the matter with them ? I frighten them . Frighten them ? You like frightening children ? Well , they 're not exactly children . - You don 't believe me , do you ? - Well , not 100 per cent , no . Go and look . I will . Small ghosts , isn 't that what you once called them ? Yeah , but I didn 't mean these ! The same ? Ghosts ? That 's one way of describing them . Except that these are ghosts before death , not after . What 's the matter with them ? Their clothes ? - The colour ? - That 's close enough , Liz . Aah , poor little boy . - Do you want your mum and dad ? - Liz . Ah , poor little soul . Is that proof enough for you ? 'I 'm ready . ' 'I 'm ready . ' Are those the clothes she was wearing the night she disappeared ? Photos ... You mean this man can actually put people into photos ? Yes . And take them out again ... like those children ? He can , yes . Poor Ruth . I 'm going to try to communicate with her . - Can I help ? - Just sit there and be quiet . You sure I can 't put myself in a trance for you ? That 's my friend - my best friend . Just sit there . If we need you to be put into a trance , she 'll do it . Well , get on with it . Ruth . Ruth ? Can you hear me ? Can you try to speak to me ? Try , Ruth , try it . Try to speak to me with your mind . I can help you . Please , Ruth . Try very hard . 'As I was going up the stair ... ' That 's her ! Her voice ! Be quiet . 'What is it ? A rhyme I knew when I was a kid . - ' How did it go ? ' - Tell us . 'Hang on , I 'm trying my best . 'Yes ... that 's it . ' " As I ... As I was going up the stair ... ' " I met a man who wasn 't there ' " He wasn 't there again today ' " I wish ... I wish he 'd stay away " 'Yes ... that 's it . 'That 's the one . I remember it . ' Why that rhyme in particular ? 'Because I 'm remembering a lot of things these days like ... 'Like it 's ... like daydreaming . 'No , I know why I remembered that . It was the man , the man on the stair . 'That 's weird , that seems like the last memory I 've ever had . 'There 's been nothing to remember since . ' Do you know where you are ? - ' No . ' - Can you see anything ? 'Not really , no . 'Only my thoughts . 'Things I remember . 'It 's , well ... It 's a bit like being asleep , 'like having an operation . 'When I was a kid I had an operation , it 's like that . 'Dreams and real things all get mixed up in my head . - ' Am I gonna be all right ? ' - Ruth ! 'The experiment . Ask her about the experiment . ' Yes , you 're going to be all right . 'Oh , good . ' Ruth , the man on the stair ... 'He just appeared , that 's all . 'I was with Mr Williamson and he was working , then the man just appeared . ' What was Mr Williamson working on at that precise moment ? 'I don 't know . Some sort of photograph . 'Are you sure I 'm not in danger ? ' Yes , I 'm quite sure . Was Mr Williamson working in his photographic room ? 'Yeah , in the darkroom . ' But you can 't remember exactly what he was doing ? 'No , not really . 'He was very pleased , excited . 'He said he 'd discovered something . 'I said would it make him rich and he laughed . I remember ! 'He was ever so pleased . He said he 'd found a way to ... What 's happening ? ! 'What 's happening ? What 's happening ? 'What 's happening ? What 's happening ? 'No ! No ! 'No ! '

 [ Narrator ] THIS IS THE ANT . TREAT IT WITH RESPECT . FOR IT MAY VERY WELL BE THE NEXT DOMINANT LIFE FORM OF OUR PLANET . SOUND INCREDIBLE ? IMPOSSIBLE ? HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN A GOOD , CLOSE LOOK AT WHAT THE ANT IS ALL ABOUT ? LIKE THESE ATTA CEPHALOTES . ONE OF THE 15,000 DIFFERENT SPECIES INHABITING OUR PLANET . THIS ONE CULTIVATES CROPS OF FUNGUS FOR FOOD . OTHERS HERD APHIDS , JUST AS MAN HERDS CATTLE . AND WHAT ABOUT THE WARRIORS ? THE BUILDERS OF BRIDGES , ROADS , TUNNELS ? FRIGHTENING , ISN 'T IT , THAT A CREATURE AS SMALL AS AN ANT IS ABLE TO HAVE A FAIR CLAIM TO RANK NEXT TO MAN IN THE SCALE OF INTELLIGENCE ? THEY HAVE A SOPHISTICATED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM . SPECIFIC MESSAGES ARE TRANSMITTED FROM ONE ANT TO ANOTHER THROUGH THE USE OF A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE CALLED PHEROMONES . IT CAUSES AN OBLIGATORY RESPONSE . DID YOU HEAR THAT ? OBLIGATORY . PHEROMONES GIVE AN ORDER THAT CANNOT BE DISOBEYED . IT 'S A MIND-BENDING SUBSTANCE THAT FORCES OBEDIENCE . BUT WE DON 'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT . THAT 'S BUSINESS BETTER LEFT TO THE ANTS . [ Siren wailing ] GOT IT ? WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG ? I STOPPED TO GET SOME EXTRA LIQUOR . YOU SHOULD 'VE LET ME KNOW . I DIDN 'T KNOW I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON CALL . YOU 'RE ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE ON CALL . SORRY , MS. FRYSER . THAT 'S ALL RIGHT , SWEETHEART . YOU 'RE SO TERRIFIC IN THE SACK THAT IT ALMOST JUSTIFIES THE EXCESSIVE SALARY THAT I HAVE TO PAY YOU .

OH , WELL , IT LOOKS LIKE OUR GUESTS ARE FINALLY ARRIVING . SURE A NICE BOAT , ISN 'T IT ? WE WENT ON A BIGGER ONE TO MEXICO THAT TIME . YEAH , BUT WE PAID FOR THAT TRIP .

WHAT ABOUT DIAMOND SPRINGS ? SURE , THAT 'S PRACTICALLY NEXT DOOR . ALL YOU DO IS WALK 2 MILES TO THE RIVER AND SWIM UPSTREAM ANOTHER 10 . YOU OUGHT TO READ THE CONTRACT SHE MAKES THEM SIGN . THE JERKS THAT BUY THIS SWAMPLAND CAN 'T EVEN SELL IT FOR 2 YEARS . DREAMLAND SHORES WON 'T BE HERE IN 2 YEARS . WHY DON 'T YOU TRY SOME OF THE MEATBALLS OVER THERE ? THEY ARE REALLY TASTY .

HOW ABOUT IT ? YES , MR. STRATTON IS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS . I 'VE WORKED FOR HIM ABOUT 20 YEARS . HIS PERSONAL EXECUTIVE SECRETARY , YOU UNDERSTAND . IT 'S QUITE A RESPONSIBILITY . CHEAP SCOTCH . I THINK ITS ALL A COME-ON . SO WHAT ? IT 'S FREE , ISN 'T IT ? THAT 'S WHAT VELMA AND I LIKE THE MOST . THAT 'S A LONG TIME TO BE WITH ONE COMPANY . NOT WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL THE BENEFITS THAT CAN ACCRUE- - GIFTS , BONUSES , RETIREMENT PENSION . NO WONDER YOU 'RE LOOKING INTO LAND INVESTMENTS . I WOULDN 'T SAY THAT I 'M EXACTLY LOOKING FOR INVESTMENTS . NOW , DON 'T YOU WORRY . NOBODY IS GOING TO HUSTLE YOU INTO BUYING ANYTHING . DREAMLAND SHORES SELLS ITSELF . MMPH ! THAT 'S NOT WHAT WE CAME OUT HERE FOR . COME ON . I MUST BE CRAZY OR SOMETHING . I JUST MET YOU AN HOUR AGO AND HERE I AM OUT IN THE WOODS PLAYING HOT FINGERS . LOOSEN UP . LET ME GO !

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT ? HERE . THIS PLACE . DREAMLAND SHORES . LOOK , LADY , I TOLD YOU , I 'M JUST THE BOAT DRIVER . I GET YOU HERE AND I GET YOU BACK . I DON 'T SELL THE LAND , ALL RIGHT ? EXACTLY , SO YOU SHOULDN 'T CARE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER . I DON 'T . I DON 'T GIVE A DAMN . YOU SEE , I WANT TO OPEN A SMALL BUSINESS . MAYBE AN AGENCY FOR DOMESTIC HELP . BUT IT 'S GOING TO TAKE ALL THE SAVINGS I 'VE GOT , SO I 'VE GOT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT I MAKE THE BEST INVESTMENT POSSIBLE . I DON 'T HAVE ANY OPINIONS ABOUT THAT . WELL , BUT YOU 'D BE HONEST WITH ME . LIKE , THIS LAND THEY 'RE TRYING TO SELL US , IS IT A GOOD THING ? OR NOT ? LADY , IF YOU WANT ADVICE , WOULD YOU ASK SOMEBODY ELSE , PLEASE ? I JUST HAD A PRETTY ROUGH TIME OF IT MYSELF . AND I GUESS IF I WEREN 'T SO SICK OF THE WHOLE ROUTINE , I 'D PROBABLY BE DOING WHAT YOU 'RE DOING RIGHT NOW . I BEG YOUR PARDON ? ALL THIS SELF-PITY , " NOBODY-GIVES-A-DAMN " ATTITUDE . WHAT ? THE BOOZE . RIGHT . YOU KNOW , UMM WHEN I MET YOU ON THE BOAT , I DIDN 'T LIKE YOU VERY MUCH . THAT 'S NOT EXACTLY A SURPRISE . I DON 'T KNOW . I GUESS I THOUGHT YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE MACHO , PHONY TYPES , THE KIND WHOSE BRAINS FALL OUT EVERY TIME HE UNZIPS HIS FLY . SAY , WHAT IS THIS , GROUP THERAPY ? MAYBE . I CAN 'T AFFORD TO MAKE A MISTAKE , THAT 'S ALL . I LIED TO THEM BACK THERE BEFORE . I TOLD THEM I HAD A GOOD JOB , BEEN WORKING FOR THE SAME MAN FOR 20 YEARS . THE TRUTH OF IT IS , HE FIRED ME . ALL I 'VE GOT IS SEVERANCE PAY AND REFERENCES . I 'VE GOT A JOB THAT PAYS $ 30,000 A YEAR , I OWN A 2-BEDROOM CONDOMINIUM , I 'VE GOT A $ 10,000 SPORTS CAR , I 'VE GOT A WIFE AND I GOT A 4-YEAR-OLD KID WHO THINKS I 'M GOD . HOW 'S THAT ? THAT 'S TERRIFIC . THAT 'S FABULOUS . LOOK , I WAS JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT NOT LIKING YOU . THAT 'S ALL . FORGET IT . I 'M A BAD INVESTMENT . AND WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ? BECAUSE THE ... $ 30,000-A-YEAR JOB WENT IN THE TOILET LAST YEAR . AND THE SPORTS CAR NEEDS AN OVERHAUL . AND MY WIFE IS AN EX-WIFE , WHO 'S SUING ME FOR BACK SUPPORT . MY KID WON 'T EVEN TALK TO ME ON THE PHONE . WHAT ABOUT YOUR CONDOMINIUM ? PLASTIC , LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE . SHALL WE ? OK . IF IT WAS MY MONEY AND I WAS GOING TO BUY THIS LAND , FIRST , I 'D MAKE SURE THEY STRUCK OIL ON IT , AND THEN I 'D STILL THINK TWICE . DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ? OK . DAN . YOU GOT A BUTTON OFF YOUR SHIRT . IF YOU GOT TIME , I ALWAYS CARRY A NEEDLE AND THREAD . I DON 'T NEED ANY BUTTONS . THIS BUILDING HERE IS GONNA BE TORN DOWN . AND THE DREAMLAND SHORES BEACH CLUB IS GONNA BE CONSTRUCTED IN ITS PLACE . IT 'LL BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MODERN CLUB IMAGINABLE , WITH EVERY POSSIBLE CONVENIENCE .

[ Marilyn ] NOW , DON 'T FORGET , IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING , JUST SHOUT THEM OUT . WE 'RE VERY INFORMAL HERE AND THIS TOUR IS STRICTLY FOR YOUR PLEASURE . I THINK ALL OF YOU BOATING ENTHUSIASTS WILL BE INTERESTED IN THESE PRESENTLY-AVAILABLE LOTS , WHICH , AS YOU CAN SEE , ARE CONVENIENTLY LOCATED RIGHT NEXT TO THE MARINA . ALL OF THE HOUSE LOTS YOU SEE HERE WILL BE SOLD ON A FIRST COME , FIRST SERVED BASIS . IF YOU SEE A LOT THAT APPEALS TO YOU , JUST TELL CHARLIE OR ME AND WE 'LL GIVE YOU FIRST REFUSAL . LARRY , WHAT DO YOU THINK ? IT 'S NOT WHAT I THINK , IT 'S WHAT DADDY THINKS , ISN 'T IT ? HONEY , YOU KNOW MY FATHER ONLY WANTS TO HELP US- - BOTH OF US . HE 'D HELP US A LOT MORE IF HE 'D LEAVE US ALONE . THEN MAYBE HE 'D BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT I COULD GIVE YOU . YOU WILL NOTICE THAT WE HAVE CAREFULLY PRESERVED THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF DREAMLAND SHORES . YOU 'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE LONG WALKS INTO THESE SECLUDED AREAS . ... BIRDS AND BUTTERFLIES AND FRAGRANT FLOWERS . FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOLF ENTHUSIASTS , YOU 'LL PROBABLY WANT TO BE SITUATED OVERLOOKING THE 18-HOLE GOLF COURSE , WHICH WILL SOON BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION . AFTER WE STOP AT OUR PICNIC AREA FOR REFRESHMENTS , WE 'LL GO ON AND LOOK AT SOME OF THE INLAND PROPERTIES . HERE WE ARE . [ Charlie ] BE CAREFUL GETTING OUT , NOW . NOW , IF WE 'RE REALLY LUCKY , WE MAY GET SOME GLIMPSES OF SOME OF THE FASCINATING WILDLIFE THAT 'S IN THIS AREA . DO YOU KNOW THERE ARE 100 DIFFERENT KINDS OF BIRDS HERE ? THERE ARE ? YES . I 'VE SEEN OVER 50 MYSELF . CHARLIE ? YOU WANT TO HELP ME WITH THE SANDWICHES , DARLING ? WOULD YOU LIKE A PLATE ? THANK YOU . IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THOSE ROMANTIC PLACES YOU USED TO SEE IN OLD MOVIES . WHAT DOES YOUR HUSBAND THINK ABOUT THE IDEA ? HE 'S NOT VERY INTERESTED . OH , WHAT A SHAME . BUT YOUR HUSBAND SEEMS TO BE . THEN I TOOK ONE OF THOSE LONG , SLOW LOOKS . YOU KNOW THE KIND YOU TAKE ON A RAINY WEEKEND WHEN HE 'S HOME PLAYING GOODY-GOODY FAMILY MAN ? I GOT UP ONE DAY , GOT DRESSED AND TOLD THE BASTARD TO GO BACK TO HIS WIFE . YOU KNOW SOMETHING ? FROM THEN ON , IT WAS JUST LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR . I CASHED IN MY FUR COAT AND ALL THE OTHER LITTLE KNICK-KNACKS AND DECIDED TO BUY MYSELF A PIECE OF SOMETHING REALLY LEGITIMATE- - LIKE A HOUSE . I COULD GO TO BED WHEN I WANTED TO GO TO BED . THAT 'S WHY I 'M HERE . ALTHOUGH , YOU KNOW , I REALLY DON 'T KNOW WHAT 'S SO GREAT ABOUT OWNING A HOUSE . THOMAS , WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? LOOKING , JUST LOOKING . YOU 'RE TRYING TO FIND FAULT , AREN 'T YOU ? YOU DON 'T TRUST ANYBODY . MOST PEOPLE ARE DISHONEST . LETS GET BACK TO THE OTHERS . IN A MINUTE , IN A MINUTE . LOOK AT THIS , MARY !

[ High-pitched noise ] WHAT 'S THAT NOISE ? SEEMS TO BE COMING FROM OVER THERE . IT 'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT . IT 'S PROBABLY SOME OF OUR PUMPING EQUIPMENT . MARILYN , THERE 'S NO PUMP . WE 'D BETTER GET BACK TO THAT BOAT . SHUT UP . THERE 'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT , EVERYBODY . WHEN YOU COMPARE ALL THE BENEFITS OF DREAMLAND SHORES TO OTHER LAND INVESTMENTS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN , I 'M CERTAIN YOU WILL REALIZE WHAT A WONDERFUL VALUE WE HAVE HERE . OH , MY GOD ! LOOK !

GO ON ! WHY WOULD WE THINK THAT ? MR. STRATTON ALWAYS LIKED A CUP OF NICE HOT TEA AT THE END OF A HARD DAY , WITH A SLICE OF ORANGE PEEL . I TOOK VERY GOOD CARE OF HIM . I STARTED THERE AS A FILE CLERK . AND AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS , DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY GAVE ME MY NOTICE OF TERMINATION ? IT WAS A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER ... A MEMO . " DEAR MS.

" YOU WILL RECEIVE THE USUAL SEVERANCE PAY , " AS IS CUSTOMARY WITH THIS FIRM . " MR. STRATTON DIDN 'T EVEN SIGN IT . I 'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS , NEVER TAKEN ANY CHANCES , NEVER DONE ANYTHING DANGEROUS . IT 'S NOT FAIR THAT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME . OH , LARRY , IF IT 'S ANY CONSOLATION , NONE OF US ARE ENJOYING THIS BOAT RIDE ANYMORE THAN YOU ARE . MAIN PART OF THE RIVER LOOKS LIKE IT COMES FROM THAT WAY . [ Larry ] IT 'S TO THE LEFT .

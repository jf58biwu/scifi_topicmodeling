 - Do you know where we want to be ? . - Yes . Let me see you locate it . [ TRACKING SIGNAL ] All right , make it quick . - So that 's it ? . - Uhuh . Not like home . How are we going to get inside ? . We 'll find a way . Come on . - They 're down . - What ? . Avon and Vila , they 're a mile from the Q-Base . - Just a minute . - What is it ? . - We 've picked something up . - We think . - What ? . - I 'll swear it 's moving . - Zen , give us optimum range on the aft scanners . - Confirmed . There it is , look . The spectro says it 's ferrous . Could still be a meteor a long way off . Clear vision . Confirmed . It 's certainly not a meteor . - Incredible ! - Well , what is it ? . Probably the oldest ship you 'll ever see , Wanderer class , the first Earth ships to reach deep space . - So how old ? . - Six , seven hundred years . Close vision . It 's hardly moving . They were slow , Jenna , infraluminal . Question is , how did it get here ? . Well , what do you mean ? . Well , even travelling at maximum speed it would take , what , three thousand years for one of those things to get this far out . - It must have been lifted here . - And then set adrift ? . Why ? . - I think we should take a look . - No . Oh Cally , there can hardly be any danger . - I detect life . - Human life ? . Yes . Oh I don 't know , there is something . I 'm confused . [ ROCKET IGNITION AND LIFT-OFF ] Attention ! Sensors indicate a surface launch . A missile ? . No , it can 't be . They can 't have spotted Liberator . We 've got the blind down . There it is , look , just leaving the ionosphere . They 're sending up a salvager from Fosforon . Well , they 'll get a surprise . Seven centuries . It just doesn 't seen possible . It isn 't , and that is what is worrying me . Are you alright Cally ? . They 're ready . They 're watching . Who ? . What are you talking about ? . Cally , what are you picking up ? . I don 't know , but Blake , there is something malignant on that ship . We can get inside through here . Must we ? . [ FISSION CUTTER ] [ ENTRY COMM ] Have you checked with Section Six ? . Yes sir , there is something there . They 're watching it sir , but it won 't come nearer than two hundred thousand miles . It will now Tak , Dr Bellfriar sent out a recovery team . It 's only a piece of junk . It 's too small to be anything important . Dr Bellfriar hasn 't much to do ; he should take up a hobby . Make sure he gets ground transportation and course co-ordination will you please ? . - Right Sir . - That 's all . What will Dr Bellfriar do with it , sir ? . He 'll bring it back to his laboratories and analyse it . Then analyse what he 's analysed . I could never understand why a scientist of his eminence should choose to bury himself here . - This is where he 'll be . - How do you know ? . He 's the base commander , this the command centre , it has a certain logic wouldn 't you say ? . Well , he might be on holiday . - Put this on . - What do you call this , then ? . Orac , I want to tap Central Spacecraft Registry . Can you do that ? . - Tap ? What is that ? - Obtain information from the records . That is possible , but it will take time . I want the histories of every Wanderer Class One spacecraft ever registered . Very well . This information will be relayed as obtained through the auxiliary monitor . Still worried ? . It 's not our concern , you know . I don ' t like mysteries . Zen , range the aft scanners on that ship again . Confirmed . That salvager will be making hull contact within the hour . I think they should be warned . - What about ? . - There 's life aboard . Blake , that is a Federation base down there . The salvagers are manned by Federation personnel . - They 're human . - I need proof of that . Cally is not often wrong . - What do you men want ? . - Hello Tynus . Kerr Avon . How the devil did you get here ? . Something called a teleport system . It beats shuttles . Come into my quarters . It 's safer there . Did anyone see you ? . Well if they did , they didn 't look twice . - Do you mind ? . - We 've just been through a pipe . Are you sure no one saw you ? . We didn 't hear any alarms . That , by the way , is Vila . Yes , yes , one of your colleagues from the Liberator . I see they 're keeping you in touch . Well , amongst other things Q-Base is also a radio link station . Fosforon may be a hole in the middle of nowhere , but we still get Federation gossip . - That 's why we 're here . - I don 't understand . What do you mean ? . Tynus , you really didn 't think that I dropped in to talk over old times ? . - No . - Blake sent us The Federation have started transmitting A-line messages using a new pulse code . We need to break that code . That 's impossible . Not impossible , Tynus . Remember , we trained together . That code is unbreakable without a TP crystal tuned into that pulse . Exactly . That 's what we 've come for . - No , I can 't do it . - You can . And you will . It 's more than my life 's worth , Avon . We need that crystal , Tynus . You must have a spare . They always supply two . It 's not that easy . I 'm only the commander technician here . Federation Security is in charge of all sensitive stores . I see . All right , the TP crystal is part of the A-line converter , is that right ? . - Yes . - Then it will have to break down . You can arrange a little malfunction there , then apply for the replacement crystal , we 'll take the old one . We don 't mind second-hand goods , do we Vila ? . No , we 're not fussy . - I don 't think you know what you 're asking . - I know exactly what I 'm asking . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - I 'm wanted . - What 's your answer ? . I 'll have to think about it . I must go . I hope you can trust him . - I told you , he 's a friend of mine . - Yes , I always knew you had a friend I used to say to people " I bet Avon 's got a friend , somewhere in the galaxy " . And you were right . That must be a novel experience for you . Where did this originate ? . We don 't know sir ; the message came in on all channels simultaneously . Couldn 't you trace the source ? . We 're trying sir , but the signal was so powerful that it knocked everything out , even the landlines . Well , get this message to Dr. Bellfriar . I think it 's intended for his department . Before you do that , make sure this message is A-lined to Federation Headquarters Command . Right sir . - All the home comforts . - Leave that stuff alone . You live your way , I 'll live mine . Mm , must be all of two days old . - Nervous ? . - Just careful . We 've just received this odd message . I think it 's from your friends on the Liberator . " Advise your recovery crew to proceed with utmost caution , derelict spacecraft may contain hostile life . " What does it mean ? . A few hours ago , detectors picked up some space debris . We sent a ship to investigate . Well , I suppose it could be from Blake . He has these generous impulses . By the way , why don 't our detectors pick up the Liberator ? . Anti-detection screen , one of Avon 's gadgets . We 're expecting it to break down any time . Let 's get back to the TP crystal , that 's what we 're here for . You know you 're asking me to commit suicide . Is there something wrong with your memory , Tynus ? . You owe me , remember ? . Not enough to put my head on the block . We were in a fraud together . When I was arrested , I kept my mouth shut . If I hadn 't , old friend , you would be sweating out the rest of your life on a convict planet , and that could still happen if I were to let the authorities know . So that 's the way it is ? . Well , let 's just say I did you a favour and now I 'm collecting . Nice . When Avon holds out the hand of friendship , watch his other hand . That 's the one with the hammer . Ah sir , this came about the recovery team . " Derelict spacecraft may contain hostile life . " This a joke ? . - That 's the message . - Who sent it ? . - Nobody seems to know . - What 's Tynus doing ? . Painting , I imagine . That 's how he spends most of his time . Oh , the man 's space-happy , of course . This base is full of psychotics . Do you think the signal is a hoax ? . No , this message was sent before anyone could have known what that recovery team would find , and it does say quite categorically " derelict spacecraft " . - You 're going to take it seriously then ? . - Well , I think it would be wise , Gambrill Somebody out there seems to know more than we do . How 's the recovery going ? . In approach orbit , should be docking in about twenty minutes . Good . Alert the station . We want full quarantine around the landing bay , the whole operation to be remote videoed . Everything we practised . All right sir . Chief medic instruction , all personnel . Landing alert , routine one , full quarantine restrictions at the landing bay . If there 's anything in this message sir , I suppose this could be a little piece of history . A high point in your scientific career , Gambrill . Just think of it , in less than twenty minutes you could be shaking hands with an exomorph . Not if it 's hostile sir , I 've got my pension to think about . No ! No , I can 't do it . Apart from anything else , it 's practically impossible technically . It isn 't and you know it . The crystal runs the spectrum from bands L to Y up to 30,000 megahertz . All you have to do is mess up the feedback from the converter and the effect will show a fault on the crystal . - I see you haven 't forgotten your stuff . - I don 't see any problem . The problem is getting to the converter . I can 't do it . I 'm the commander , if I were to be seen to get my hands dirty , people would remember . Is there any time that the section is unattended ? . No , it 's manned all the time , three operators day and night . - The only chance I can see ... - Yes ? . - No , no I can 't do it . - Would you rather the convict planet , Tynus ? . Fire is the greatest hazard here , oxygen-rich atmosphere . If I started a small electrical fire near the section , the men on duty would run to their fire-drill positions . Good . That would leave the converter unattended for about ten minutes , long enough to give you the change to get a malfunction organised . - What will you be doing ? . - Directing the fire fighting . - I shall need to look the job over first . - That can be arranged . Avon , this whole thing is stretching out . Blake won 't want to wait . Blake will have to wait . How long before we get the crystal , Tynus ? . An hour to check the course of the fire , make sure the malfunction is working . Then , of course , I 'd better get Security to release the spare crystal , oh , I 'd say ten hours at least . - Ten hours ? . - That is what Avon has reported . - That 's a long time . - Shall I call them back ? No . Without that crystal we 'll never break the Federation pulse code . We need to read their messages if we 're to stay ahead of Servalan . Sticking around here 's no way to stay ahead . Why ? . Zen 's got the scanners at maximum range , the first sign of trouble , we pull out . If they come at us from behind Fosforon , they 're going to be on us before we know it . Well there 's no chance of that , unless they already have our position plotted . Optimist ! [ SCANNER ALERT ] What 's that ? . We 're tracking that Wanderer . I might go down there . - To Fosforon ? . - As I said before , I don 't like mysteries Listen , Orac has done his stuff , the histories of every Wanderer Class One ever built . Orac , repeat the information you 've just given me . The only ship not accounted for is K-Forty-Seven . That went missing seven hundred years ago in the vicinity of 6 1 Cygni . The names of the crew were Kemp , Wardin , and Tober . Furthermore ... - Than k you , Orac . - Only three ? . Well , those old ships couldn ' t take any more . It was like living in a pickle barrel for 30 years . I don 't know how they stood it . Some of them didn 't . Mind you , hibernation pills helped . Does 6 1 Cygni mean anything to you ? . That 's the Darkling Zone , isn 't it ? . Well , that 's the poetic name for it , yes . It 's the only region near Earth that 's never been charted . Yes , I remember . A lot of ships have disappeared there . They think it 's a centre of meteor storms . That theory 's running a little thin just now . If K-47 hit the centre of a meteor storm , why would it suddenly reappear thousands of light years away ? . So what 's your theory ? . I 'm not launching any theories till I 've tested the water . I 'm going to teleport down . What about Avon and Vila ? . - They 've got enough to do . - Yes , but what about Federation Security ? . Well , at the first sign of trouble , I 'll come back up . Look Blake , they know all about the teleport system . The first time they get your bracelet .. Jenna , I have been down before . I 'm sorry . I will be very careful . All right . Public Address : Remote recovery unit Red Zero . approach on Site 5 , boarding teams stand by . [ RETROS FIRING ] Approach complete , boarding team proceed . Quarantine instructions have been carried out , boarding party are about to enter . Good . Gambrill , who 's that fool in the evacuation tunnel ? . - I don 't know sir . - Well get him out of it ! Come out of there you idiot ! Come on , there 's an access port right in front of you . - Find out who it is . - Hurry man ! Yes sir . Visual Control ? . Get me vision link to the boarding party . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? . Don 't you know enough to steer clear of the exhaust vents during a landing ? . You could have got yourself killed in there . - I thought the ship was down . - The engines aren 't vented yet . You 're not one of our men . No , I 'm looking for whoever 's in charge . I 've got some information concerning that ship you salvaged . Information ? . What kind of information ? . Who are you ? . Don 't ask questions , just take me to whoever 's in charge . Nothing here , power deck 's clear . Watch yourselves ! Some of these fittings break off in your hands . Must be stinking centuries . Going up . Nothing in the forward compartment . Bring the second spot over , will you ? Watch it ! Can ' t see a damn thing in this dust . Where are we ? Looks like the control room . My God ! We 've found a body here , sir . Human , I think . Things aren ' t too clear . - He 's in a compression suit . - Any s ign of life anywhere ? . Nothing sir . We 've been over the whole ship now . All right . Put the remains in an anti-contamination bag . - Bring them down to Dr. Wiler , will you ? . - Right , sir . This is the one I 've just fished out of the evacuation tunnel , sir . Well ? . You said this base was full of psychotics ; you wait till you hear this one . What exactly is that supposed to mean ? . I told him I teleported here . He didn 't believe me . Well , Gambrill 's like that , I 'm afraid . Lacks faith . Defined as the capacity to believe what you know isn 't true ? . Read this . What is it ? . The service history of that ship you 've got in the landing bay . I sent you a warning about it earlier . - Where did this come from ? . - Central Registry . Seven hundred years old ? . And just who are you ? . Well , according to the Federation , I 'm a political criminal . You may have heard of me . My name is Blake . Yes , but then we 're absentminded scientists , you see . In fact , we 've forgotten your name already . Haven 't we , Gambrill ? . Whose name , sir ? . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Dr. Bellfriar , they 're now bringing out the body . - Body ? . I 'll get down there now . That body doesn ' t look seven hundred years old . What made you think there was hostile life in that ship ? . - One of my crew comes from Auron . - A telepath ? . Yes , she sensed something malignant out there . Not necessarily human . I think you 'd better be very , very careful , Dr. Bellfriar . We 're always very , very careful . Lacomb , message . - How do you feel ? . - Thirsty . - Do you think you can handle that ? . - Maybe . It 's a new model , since my time . No , it 's just the way the converter 's packaged . The circuitry 's the same . I shall need more than ten minutes . That 's all the time you 've got , Avon , and I can 't even guarantee that . Tynus , you will give us all the time we need . There 's nothing to see yet . Oh come on , Wiler ! He 's a good man , but slow , like all pathologists . What 's happened ? . Well , it 's standard drill with a space death . The autopsy 's carried out in a sealed mortuary in case there are any alien microorganisms around . Are you all set , Dr. Wiler ? . I 'll tell you when I 'm ready , sir . Thank you , Dr. Wiler . Do you want to watch this ? . - So you really do teleport , do you ? . - Over short distances , yes . Well of course , the theory 's as old as physics , but I didn 't know it had been cracked yet . Liberator 's a very advanced ship . Of course , you have to know the surface conditions , otherwise teleporting 's a bit like a jump in the dark . You 're quite liable to surface in a fission reactor . Not a mistake you could learn by , really . - All ready , Dr. Bellfriar . - Thank you Dr. Wiler , go ahead . Second Pathologist Wiler , Q-Base . Autopsy report coded 1 49906 The clinical presentation is of a well-nourished male Caucasian , aged between thirty-five and forty-five . There are no surface wounds or lesions that would indicate death by violence . I am now examining the clothing on the torso and upper section of the body . It 's extremely old , it disintegrates when touched . Ah , there is a neck chain with a metal disc , which I now examine . The disc is embossed with a number , six figures , possibly a service number . And a name : Wardin . W-A-R-D-I-N . Are you , quite sure about that , Dr. Wiler ? . It 's slightly corroded sir , but it 's perfectly clear . Kemp , Wardin , Tober , missing in the constellation of 6 1 Cygnii , seven hundred years ago . - May I continue ? - Sorry . There is an old surgical scar extending from behind the left ear in the region of the supra mastoid crest , up over the cranium . The eyeballs are soft and the tissue of the upper extremities is also soft , and there is extensive maceration of the skin over the neck . That 's a degree of biolysis you get after one or two weeks , not after hundreds of years . I now raise the left arm of the cadaver to examine the hand the fingers are dehydrated and mummified and the nails are loose . - Suppose the body 's been frozen . - What , cryogenically stored ? . - Yes . - Who on earth 'd want to do a thing like that ? . I 've no idea , but it 's a possible explanation , isn 't it ? . Before proceeding to examine the internal organs , I now , in accordance with the law , check the EEG reading to verify that life is extinct . Which it is . I shall now mark the tissue and blood samples for laboratory analysis . My God ! Look ! [ EEG ALARM ] Wiler ! You 've got brain life . That 's quite impossible Dr. Bellfriar . May I suggest that you adjust your monitor ? . [ CLATTER ] Dr. Bellfriar ! - Dr. Wiler 's neck 's broken . - I 'm coming down . - Dr. Bellfriar ! Look at the screen . - What ? . The EEG screen . Give us a smile . Show us a leg . - I wonder if these make good pets . - Vila ! - What ? . - You 're a fool . Nerves getting a little frayed ? . There are a quarter of a million volts running through that converter . I make one false move , I 'll be so crisped up what 's left of me won 't fit into a sandwich . I 'm a vegetarian . Thanks for the offer , though . What did Cally say about Blake being here ? . Something to do with that derelict spacecraft . As long as he doesn 't mess up our job , I don 't care what he does . - You don 't have a lot of time for Blake , do you ? . - I could never stand heroes . A quarter of a million volts and you 're putting your hand in ? . Ah , but that is self-interest . We need that crystal . Blake takes risks to help other people . Sometimes people he doesn 't even know . One day that great big bleeding heart of his will get us all killed . Unless somebody ditches him first . Poor devil ! His cervical vertebrae had been crushed as if they 'd been in a vice . No ordinary human being could exert that sort of pressure . - It wasn 't an ordinary human being . - It was the body of one . - I think it had been adapted . - What ? . Well , when Cally detected life on that ship , at first she thought it was human , then she changed her mind and thought it was alien . I think she was picking up emanations from a cybernetic implant . Virology 's my field , I 'm afraid . I 'm not following you . Wiler noticed a surgical scar on the head , didn 't he ? . Now suppose some control device had been linked into the nervous system , that would explain the electrical activity in the brain . Yes , but it stopped and went dead , didn 't it ? . Well , perhaps its task had been done , the job it was programmed for . Killing Wiler ? . It dosen 't make sense , why kill him ? . That , I wish I knew . Oh well , I suppose now we 've got to have an autopsy on Wiler , as if we hadn 't got enough to do . And what about the post-mortem on Wardin ? . - I 'm afraid we 've got more trouble sir . - What is it ? . The two technicians who went in to rescue Wiler , they 've been taken ill . They have ? . What 's the matter with them ? . They just started to act strangely , vague , wandering about , then they went into convulsions . They 're in the sick bay now . That could be a space contamination , you 'd better get me the sick bay at once . - Bio lab , get me Dr. Bax . - Yes Doctor ? Dr. Bax , those two boys you 've just admitted , I want them isolated . - Too late , I 'm afraid . - What ? . They died within minutes of admission . Poisoned , I 'd say . - Poison ? . - There 's nothing else that fast . We 've taken swabs ; I 'm running tests now . I 'll let you have the results as soon as we get them . Twelve to fifteen minutes . Well , if it 's a poison , it must be diapedesistic , something they got on their skins when they were bailing Wiler out . - What about the four who went into the spaceship ? . - They 're all right , I checked . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Dr. Bellfriar ? - Yes ? . Three of my men are showing signs of infection . Good God ! Well that knocks your poison theory on the head , doesn ' t it ? . Maybe . I 'm putting this whole sick bay into isolation as of now . - Do you want any help Dr. Bax ? . - It 's a medical problem . I think we can handle it . Very well . If there 's anything you want , let me know . I 'll check in grotobiotics , there might be more cases . Gambrill , I want this whole section sealed off from the rest of the base . Absolute isolation from now on , prophylaxis of contacts , sterilisation screens in every department . - Right sir . - Well , now might be a good time for you to leave . No , I 'm getting curious . - Yes , Doctor ? - Commander Tynus , we have an infection alert . It 's nothing to worry about , the landing zone is quarantined until further notice . - What 's happened ? . - We 've had a few casualties . There seems to be a link with that spaceship we landed . That 's all I know at the moment , we 're working on it . I understand . Good luck . That could help us . - How ? . - Only our section to handle the fire . - Bellfriar 's team 's out of action . - You sure there 's going to be a fire ? . The thermal pack I planted should be going off any minute now . [ EXPLOSION ] It 's up to you now . [ FIRE ALARM ] Come on . Watch the door . - Avon ! - What ? . Why are we stringing along with Tynus ? . Look , we 've come this far . Forget about setting up the malfunction . Grab the crystal and let 's get back to the Liberator . Use your head . If we take the crystal now , how long do you think it will take the Federation to figure out who 's got it ? . Five seconds ? . They will merely issue a new pulse code and we 'll be back where we started . Now get back to the door . - Nearly ten minutes Avon , get a move on . - All right , I think I 've done it . Hurry up . - Embalming fluid , as near as dammit . - Mm ? . What ? . The blood sample Wiler took , these are the lab results coming through . It 's spreading rapidly . Sir , we 've got eight cases in grotobiotics and several more in the main lab . Well , have you traced the contacts ? . That 's the point sir , there doesn 't seem to have been any . - But there must have been , somebody 's lying . - I don 't think so sir . Well then , it must have spread from the sick bay . Dr. Bax , oh , come on man . My God ! Nothing we know could do that . - How 's it spreading , through the air ? . - Not necessarily . It must be airborne . That would explain why the four that went into the spaceship were not infected , they had their own air systems . Well , if it 's a virus , its biotic potential must be incredible . To kill its host as quickly as that , it must multiply a thousand times faster than anything we know . It seems to attack the nervous system , destroying the memory . The memory ? . What , just the memory ? . No , no , that 's the first thing ; then the motor centre . Then there 's a rapid rise in temperature and fulminating blisters all over the body , then the heart packs up . Are the viral filters all activated ? . We should be getting the first test results through any minute now . Well , nothing we can do then , is there ? . Just sit here and sweat it out . That won 't be so easy sir . The men are on the edge of panic , you can smell it . Yes , well we can 't move towards an antiserum until we 've identified the organism and typed its morphology . - There might not be that much time sir . - I presume the station is air-conditioned . - Yes , why ? . - Shut it down If you stop the air circulating you might at least slow the spread of infection . - That 's a good idea . Well go on man , get a move on . - Right sir . Well , we 're really going to have to sweat it out . - Have you fixed the converter ? . - I reckon so . - Good . - You did a good job with that fire . Yes , it went better than I planned . It almost got out of control . What 's that ? . All that 's left of the incendiary mechanism , I don 't want that found . - It wouldn 't be recognised . - Maybe not but there 's no point in taking any chances . Get rid of it . I 'd better make my report to Security . Wait in my quarters will you , and I 'll bring you back a food package . Make it a big one . - Avon , come here ! - What 's the matter ? . That old friend of yours should go a long way in the service , the further the better . Listen to this . " Servalan , Federation HQ , Urgent . Liberator in orbit , Fosforon . Detaining ten hours . Make speed . Tynus , Q-Base . " Well , I 've worked in virology for twenty years . I 've never come across anything like this before . If it does turn out to be a virus , it 's going to make us change all our ideas . - Do you want to hear a theory ? . - At the moment , I 'd listen to anybody . My idea that Wardin was adapted . " Why kill Wiler ? " you asked , why go to such lengths to kill one man ? . I remember . Wiler was killed to release the virus , to make people go into the sealed-off mortuary to help him . What , do you mean it was a deliberate plan ? . That 's a bit far-fetched isn 't it Blake ? . - Have you ever heard of Lord Jeffrey Ashley ? . - Who ? . Mm , pre space age , planet Earth . He was the commander of a British garrison in America , having trouble with hostile natives , redskins . Ashley ordered blankets from smallpox victims to be baled up and sent to the hostile tribes . - Germ warfare . - Uhuh . - You mean we 've picked up a bale of blankets , do you ? . - Seems to make sense . - Sent from where ? . - May I use your star chart ? . Here . 6 1 Cygni . You notice the area 's not charted ? . I think there 's an alien civilisation , highly advanced , deeply distrustful of mankind , avoiding all contact , so that if our ships go too near , they simply vanish . I think K-47 was returned to us , baited with a skilfully preserved human being and loaded with a virus biologically engineered to destroy the human species . It 's a trap we fell into with both feet . You could be right , but the virus is an unreliable weapon . This one seems effective enough . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Dr. Bellfriar , Dr. Bellfriar . - Yes , Gambrill ? . - I can 't see us finding a vaccine , sir . We 've tried everything , but there 's no way of processing these results . What about the online console ? . - Dead , sir . Probably the fire . - You mean you haven ' t got a computer here ? . Well , there are several of them on the base but they 're not in the quarantine area . - I can 't get at them . - All right , give the tapes to me . Tell me what you want to know and I 'll get the answer for you . - How ? . - On board the Liberator I have the most advanced computer ever designed . The way the infection 's spreading here , you 'll all be dead before you 're half way to getting the answer . All right Blake . These data blocks contain lab tests on about five thousand micro-organisms . I need them scanned for known characteristics and the stranger , the paratype organism , picked out . It shouldn 't take Orac too long . Keep your receptor open , I 'll set up communications . - All right . - Good luck . Cally , this is Blake , bring me up . Where do you think , where d 'you think you 're going ? . Get back to your post . Tak ! Get back to your post ! - I 'm getting out while I 've got a chance . - Orders are that nobody leaves this section . To hell with orders ! I 'm not staying here to die . Listen Cal . Dr. Bellfriar , Gambrill here . I 'm in the observation room area . There 's total panic down here . It 's not just the technicians , the medics as well ; they 're all getting out , breaking quarantine . Damn fools ! They 'll spread the infection right through the base . I tried to stop them . They 're mad with fear , they wouldn 't listen . Tell the guards on the main entrance , nobody leaves . They can shoot if necessary . Guards ... Tell the guards ... - I wonder what plans he has for you ? . - What ? . Tynus . He hopes to get a medal for catching us , but he won 't want you picked up , not with what you 've got on him . I think you 're going to have an accident , Avon . We shall see who has the accident . A man who sketches insects must have an eye for detail . He 's probably worked out an ingenious solution . I 've got one for each of you . Hydrolysed protein . - Thanks . - I 've got to put it in the oven first . - Don 't bother . - Lost our appetites suddenly . It 's all this hanging about . When do we get the crystal Tynus ? . As soon as the fault in the A-line shows up , then I can send to Security for a replacement crystal , but it all takes time . Relax ; you 've nothing to worry about . And if you believe that , you 'll believe anything . - Plague ? ! . - Yes sir , it seems so . The men are falling like flies . The rest are cutting out , getting off the base . It 's reached the security section , they 're dying . Bellfria r , we 've an ep idemic here . What 're you doing about it ? . There 's nothing I can do . It 's a new virus ; we 've got no defence against it . That 's ridiculous , you 're the medical section . My men are dying , you must do something . All I can advise you is to turn offyour air pumps and orderyour people to stay at their posts . The less they move around , the better their chances . But I thought you were supposed to be the greatest living authority on viruses , Bellfriar . Apparently not . I 'm going to see that the Federation Medical Council hears of this . I don 't think that 's going to matter to me , Tynus , or to any of us . - That does it ! Let 's go ! - Not so fast . We came for that crystal . Forget the crystal , they 're dying like flies out there . Didn 't you hear ? . So there will be a lot of panic and confusion . Tynus will have his hands full . If we destroy the converter , destroy it completely ; it will look like a result of the fire . When they come to rebuild it , they will not suspect that we have taken the crystal . - Well , you may be right . - Let 's go . - I 've got that result foryou . - Good man . According to our scan , the paratype organism is number 9-2-6 in your batch of samples . Now we 're getting somewhere . 9-2-6 . Dr. Bellfriar , anything else I can do to help ? . - Obviously not . - I hope we got that through to him in time . Keep an eye on the corridor . Public Address : Attention ! All personnel are instructed to remain at their posts . The situation is under control . Under control ? . You know this could be another Casarus . - What ? . - Remember the Casarus swamp fever , killed millions . Well there aren 't millions here , so don 't worry about it . Well I 'm here , and I do worry about it . I don 't like bugs . You can 't hear them , you can 't see them and you can 't feel them , then suddenly you 're dead . We 'll be out of here in a few minutes . Get back to the corridor . Beautiful ! And so simple . Detonator . Moan . Argh . - I thought I 'd find you here . - I got tired of waiting . Raise your hands . Carefully . Come round here . - So you 're going to kill me ? . - It 's nothing personal . - I shall try not to hold it against you . - You know too much about me . I should have turned you in when I had the chance . [ MOAN ] Argh . - Thanks for your help . - Never come between friends , that 's my motto . All right Cally , get us out of here fast ! [ TELEPORT WHINE ] - Well done . - I can 't say that it was a pleasure . Now are we going to stand here and look at it , or are we going to move ? . Why ? . Tynus tried to trap us . He sent a message to Servalan . There 'll be a Federation fleet here at any time . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - There 's a transmission from Fosforon . - Jenna . - Go ahead . - Blake , I think I 've found the answer . Too late , I 'm afraid , for anybody here , but it 's absolutely vital that you record the following information . Jenna . You are being recorded doctor , go ahead . Everyone who 's been into deep space has had the Terran ague , or the " three-day sweats " which it 's commonly known as . It 's a sort of a mild infection , it slightly alters the body 's nucleic structure , It seems to be a metabolic reaction to space travel . Well this new virus , Paratype 9-2-6 , attacks those altered cells and acts as a catalyst . They burst and , well ... The effects are literally a series of explosions that race through the body 's neural cell structure . The virus is easily cultured in human tissue or in nucleic acid solution . Now , here is the formula for the antiserum . Dr. Bellfriar , are you saying that this virus is only effective , against human beings who 've been in deep space ? . Precisely . It fits your theory . But I don 't think that the virus was designed to destroy man , merely to confine him to his own planet . - Now here is the formula . - Go ahead . H-N , H-N-O ... oh , My God ! Dr. Bellfriar ! Dr. Bellfriar ! I 've forgotten how to read . T ransmission ends . - Fosforon ends . - It 's no joke Vila . Cally , Jenna , get the ship moving . I 'm going to put out a plague warning . Are you crazy ? . I 've got to warn all traffic to stay away from Fosforon until that virus burns itself out . Listen , Blake , Servalan is on her way here . She lands on Fosforon , she gets the plague , she 's off our backs for good . You cannot put out a warning . Suppose some of them don 't die ? . Suppose some of them get off in a ship ? . That plague goes out to all the galaxies , millions will die because of it . THAT is the one responsibility that I will not take . Zen , I want to put a plague warning transmitter into orbit round Fosforon , then set a course for the constellation Sauros , speed standard by ten . Confirmed . There has to be a warning Jenna . There has to be .

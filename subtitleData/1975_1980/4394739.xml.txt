 GREG : Slow down for the bend . Whoa , not that slow . That 's better . Let 's go through Micklesham . - A town ? But you said before ... - I know I said towns are blocked , but the streets can 't all be full of rot . Anyway , I 'm tired of skirting around . I want to get home . - ABBY : Hey , that was a risk . - Well , there was no one about . Yes . But there might be someone thinking just that . - It would be a silly way to die . - Sorry . Just give a toot on the horn next time . ( HONKING HORN ) Anyway , it 'd be silly to die in town , too . So , what 's the hurry ? If you 're son 's at home , he 's at home . You 'll see him when you get there . If Peter 's alive , and he 's at home , then he 'll be living in one of the outhouses because the house is burnt . And if there 's no food supply and no one turns up , then how long will he stay there ? Should have thought of that sooner . - Yes , I should . - It 's been weeks . Look , why don 't you drop me off at the first car and I 'll make my own way , and you can carry on by the side roads and we 'll meet up . - I don 't mind . - Nor me . We are unlikely to catch typhoid in February , are we ? Well , I wouldn 't like to bet on it . We can stay in the car , then . All right . Thanks . Oh , turn right at the main road . GREG : What are you doing ? JENNY : I don 't know . The pedal isn 't working . I haven 't done anything . Yeah , well , press brake gently and pull in . Clutch , clutch , clutch . Then you change down . Well , just put the clutch in . Clutch in . That 's it . - Well , what is it ? - ( GRUNTS ) Well , I don 't know . There should be a couple of gallons left in it . Anybody know what day it is ? I meant to keep a diary . My birthday on the 21st . - What can I do ? - Well , could you try the ignition again ? Yeah . ( CAR ENGINE CRANKING ) Well , I don 't know . Unless the jets are blocked . It 's going to be dark in a few hours . We 'll have to camp here . Sorry , girls . JENNY : Here , let me help . ( TAPPING ON DASHBOARD ) It 's stuck . We are out of petrol . - But you said that the gauge was ... - I know , I know . But it 's jammed . ( SIGHING ) Right . Well , we 're about here . That 's a fairly big road . Must be a mile . There could be a garage there . And that , look , that 's about three miles . Gilton . There might be a garage there . - You mean , we push ? - No . I 'll go up to the crossroads . - Look , it 's all right . I 'll go . - Well , I can 't see why . If there 's a garage , there 'll be a can . And I can work a handle . I 'll make some coffee . Anything you fancy ? Got more ham . Pilchards , baked beans , corned beef . JENNY : Chop suey and pickles ? Fine . ( BIRD CHIRPING ) Abby at least has a purpose . Oh , so have I. I want to stay alive . Can 't aim higher than that . Yeah , but I 'm an engineer . I should be getting organised . All I seem to want to do is just to keep the cold out . That 's all right . ( BIRD CHIRPING ) That thrush doesn 't care what you do . ( JENNY CHUCKLING ) ( SMACKS LIPS ) Thanks . Jenny , it 's the emptiness . It 's not meeting a living soul . Even a crash at that crossroad would have been something . Do you dream ? - What ? - At night . Yes . You ? Yes . Crazy . Mmm . Could do with some milk . Do you dream about the people that you 've known ? Mmm . And others I haven 't . I don 't know if I 'm dead or awake or what . Do you have that ? No . I dream I 'm in a fire . I suppose it 's Rotterdam when I flew over it . Or the fire I know we need now for all the towns to clean them out . Can I hug you ? Thanks . ( GREG CHUCKLING ) ( SIGHS ) ( MUMBLING ) How many notices are out ? Oh , I don 't know . Did you want me to count ? Uh , well , there 's eight there . We started with 50 . - And that 's 42 . - Clever . Right . Make a note . When we get back , - run off more notices . - Run off more notices . CHARLES : Turnips . Well , they 'll have to lie and rot . We haven 't got much at all today , except that plough at the pub . And no people . We seem to have gathered everyone from around here . Mmm . Are we going back to Maredell ? - No . We 'll take this road here , see ? - Mmm . There 's a farm , there 's a row of cottages ... It 's not a mirage . There they are . - JENNY : Maredell . - No . Somebody with a duplicator . Avoid towns ? - We 've got to go to that place . - Well , what about Peter ? Well , we needn 't stay . Well , I needn 't . But if it is a centre of information , then we must go . You know , we haven 't been boiling all the water . Maybe they have a doctor . I wonder how big a settlement it is . How long do you think those have been up , Greg ? Well , they 're not damp or faded . A week . ABBY : Must be about 30 miles . A couple of gallons of petrol . Was there any outside in the cars ? Well , the one I tried was empty . I suppose the others are , too . I 'll look . Just take the cap off ? Yeah . Otherwise , I shall just have to invent a pump . Here 's one that 's open . Wait outside till I check . LORAINE : I 'm marking it down . It smells okay . Hang on , though . " S " for slate , sheep , barley . " R " for rotten , harness for three , horses gone . " H " for hay . " O " for orchard . - Hello ? - CHARLES : Yeah ? Can I come in and get a basket ? Got some of these apples from the shed . I 'm in the kitchen . ( WATER DRIPPING ) ( SNIFFS ) - Well , it 's not smelly . - No . ( FOOTSTEPS CLIMBING STAIRS ) LORAINE : Hey ! There 's a saucepan been left to burn . They must have died before the electricity finished . How 's that for deduction ? CHARLES : There 's a generator out the back . There 's a letter here as well . " Mr John Smith . " Is he still here ? CHARLES : A man and a woman , in a bedroom . Hmm . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) It 's just about the plague . Mr and Mrs John Smith ? ( CHARLES CHUCKLING ) Or Mr Smith and girlfriend ? ( CHUCKLES ) Mrs Smith and the milkman ? No . It 's Mr and Mrs. There are two children in another room . ( CLICKING TONGUE ) Right . Well , take this down . 1840 . Fully converted . Good carpet in the dining room , the rest is rubbish . ( CHUCKLES ) Grapefruit knife . When will we see another grapefruit ? Hey , shall I write Mr and Mrs John Smith ? Yes . We 'll cross them off the electoral roll . But it 's meaningless . Maybe . But we might find somebody who knows of somebody whose looking for Great Uncle Johnny . I wonder how far the horses have gone . Well , they 're probably ponies . We need a stallion . ( INHALES DEEPLY ) Hey . Well , Mr Smith , nothing here for us . - Apples ? - Oh , he had a bicycle outside . But it 's got a puncture . What do we need that for ? We 've got a dozen good bikes . Oh , we 're a growing community , and a puncture is easy enough to mend . It 's no hardship to take it . Come on , let 's go . Mmm-hmm . - Did you bring this in ? - Well , no . I haven 't been yet . Hello ? Anybody there ? Please answer , we 're friends . You need us . We need you . ( RATTLING ) My name 's Charles . This is Loraine . Please come out . We need each other . - Hello . - Hello . We 're friends . - It 's stinky in there . - Yeah , I 'll bet . - What 's your name ? - Michael . Mick . - Smith ? - No . - I was just passing . - You 're on your own ? - Yeah . - Picked up a bit of dirt , haven 't you ? ( CHUCKLES ) Mick , um , we got a kind of a farm . Some people running it . We 're asking anyone who wants to join us , just to join us . Eggs , bread , fresh meat . - LORAINE : True . - We work at what we can . Loraine and I are going around now looking for what there is . Hmm . Here 's my notebook . - Hey , where are you from ? - Wycombe . They all died . - Been living off cans , have ya ? - Yeah . Is that your bike outside ? Yeah . But it 's got a puncture . - Could you fix it ? - ( CHUCKLES ) Yes . Good job you showed yourself , you 'd have had a bumpy journey till you found another bike . - Mick , are you quite well ? - Yeah . CHARLES : Been boiling water ? - For tea , yes . - CHARLES : And sometimes not ? - Sometimes . - How 's your tummy ? A bit runny . I 've been eating lots of apples . Oh , you 're all right . I 'd say it was apples . Well , do you want to join us ? I don 't mind . Oh , look ! A piglet . A piglet . ( PIGLET GRUNTING ) LORAINE : ( LAUGHING ) Come on , Charles . That 's it . Run . Run faster ! ( LORAINE LAUGHING ) No , run faster ! ( GRUNTING ) - Come on , run . Faster . - MICK : Faster ! LORAINE : That 's it , Charles , you nearly got it . ( LAUGHING ) Come on . Come on . You nearly got ... That 's it . Now . Now ! ( PIGLET SQUEALING ) ( CHARLES LAUGHING ) ( JENNY STRUMMING GUITAR ) Look what I found . - Oh , do you play ? - No , I 've always wanted to . Yeah , well , I 'll teach you . Well , that battery 's going flat . No , it 's all right . I 'm nearly finished . ( GRUNTING ) Sorry it 's taking so long , but at least we 're going to have it from now on . ( GREG GRUNTING ) ( SIGHING ) I 'm the wrong sort of engineer for this . Still , I 'm a good workman . Shouldn 't blame his brains . Damn it . - Blisters ? - Yeah . Need a better drill than this . Should also pick up another foot pump , too , when we can . Wait ! Where 's the other hose pipe ? Oh , here . Yeah , well , there should be a jubilee clip with it . Oh , sorry . ( GREG SIGHING ) I knew we should have brought the camp stove . GREG : Yeah . Well , now you say it . - JENNY : I 'll go . - No , wait . Look , we 're cold and hungry . Why don 't we just light a fire here ? On top of a petrol tank ? No ! To one side . We could set one of the cars alight . Look , will one of you just go back to the car and get the camping stove and the gaslight and the water and brew something ! ( CAR APPROACHING ) ( CAR BRAKES SQUEALING ) Hey , Jenny , that 's a Land Rover . CHARLES : Hello ? Are you there ? Please answer . We 're friends . Can we come in ? You need us . We need you . My name 's Charles . I 've got Mick here . All right ? ABBY : Yes . All right . Hello . We saw your car up the road . Thought you 'd be here . - Are you all well ? - Yeah . - What 's the trouble ? - There 's no trouble . Uh ... Just getting some petrol up out of the tank . - Can I look ? - Yeah . Help yourself . - A foot pump . - Yeah . Well , I just made it so that it sucks instead of blows . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , I see . That goes into the car and that goes into the ground . - That 's right . - It 's great . - Yeah . If the valve 's right . - ( CHUCKLING ) You know , I usually get petrol up by putting a bit of hose into the ground , you block up the end , and you pull it out , and you get a pint or a half pint out that way , but who 's in a hurry ? Yeah , well , I thought of that . But I 'd already started making this . In any case , this is portable . - You could use it anywhere . - It 's worth it . Well , did you see my notice ? ABBY : Oh , is it yours ? We 're collecting people , or letting people collect us . We just collected Mick . We left Loraine near your tent . She 's cooking supper . Mick 's hungry , and I 'm hungry . Can we share it with you ? As long as it isn 't chop suey . CHARLES : Roast pork . Yes , please . We met this man called Wormley who said he was the government . CHARLES : How many people did he have ? - Oh , I don 't know . About eight or nine . - Oh , they were just thugs . They broke up our settlement , just when we 'd started . Well , forget about the government . They 'll have to come to terms with nature like the rest of us . The government of what , nine , without communications is not viable . What did you do , Charles ? I was an architect . My speciality was restoring old buildings . I know where there are still watermills and windmills , and how they ' re built without 20th century sophistication . ( CHUCKLES ) I was devoted to the good life . My wife baked bread , we made wine . Bottled fruit . We kept hens and pigs . We had three children . So I 've expanded a bit , on the basis of mutual need . I 've got 12 people now , with Mick , if he wants to join us . He 's coming to see . And I left the others putting potatoes in . We took over 20 acres from the next door farm . It 's got a tendency to waterlog , but it 's ... It 'll do . What do you do about that ? It 's easy . Clear the ditches . Half a dozen people , 20 acres , it 's no trouble . Well , the main problem is wheat . We have a bit left over from my own harvest , which we use for bread but we need it to thresh it all and sow it . Yeah , but surely there 's plenty of wheat left from the harvest ? No . It 's mainly barley . Some wheat . We found some hay this afternoon where Mick was . Half the goodness gone out of it , but it 'll see the livestock through to the early summer with the silage and the barley . - What livestock ? - ( CHUCKLES ) Heifers . Everyone 's cows died because they weren 't being milked . So we rounded up some heifers and a bull . - We 'll have cow 's milk next year . - Next year ? Well , we do have a goat . And we have a 3-year-old girl and she has all the milk . Ever milked a goat ? - Oh , it 's easy . - And we got two horses . I 'd like to get some more . And a stallion . Pigs , hens . We have cats , of course . But I haven 't seen them anywhere else . The domestic puss hasn 't survived for some reason . Maybe they 've gone to ground . And the dogs are hunting in packs . So , after you 've done the dishes , we 'll build a fence . You know in the old days , they used to put a thorn hedge around villages . Are you going to accept anyone who wants to join you ? No . I can cope with a community of about 20 to 30 . If it gets beyond that , we 'll start another one somewhere , in lots of little settlements until they grow on their own and solve their own problems of growing . So we don 't know what 's going to happen . Rats , dogs , blight . So we must plan , but we must keep it flexible . Sounds as if you 're doing what I was aiming to do , but with no knowledge . - Come and join us . - LORAINE : Yes . GREG : Well , I 'd like to come and have a look . Greg , you ... You said you flew a helicopter ? - Mmm-hmm . - Well , I 've surveyed a small area around here by car . If we could solve the fuel problem , you could cover Britain . Now , we can 't afford to support parasites , but - survey is very important , so ... - Yeah , but I ... I mean , I just fly a helicopter . If I learn to service as well , that makes it become a full-time job . All right . Then that can be your job . You see , we need to know if hydroelectricity is still operating . Are the atomic power stations dangerous ? Were they shut down ? And how many survivors are there ? Enough to be viable ? Or do we have to join up with the French survivors ? I don 't know what proportion of human population is big enough to keep us going . But I do know that one settlement of 12 , 15 , isn 't enough . - You mean inbreeding ? - Hmm . And natural frailty . Maybe four out of five infants won 't survive to become adults . Diet deficiency . No medicine , no surgery . How many doctors are left in Britain ? Twenty or one ? Or none ? No , the problem of the next generation , like my seed crop , is very , very urgent . Do you have just the one child in the settlement ? No , we 've got four . We 've got Biddy , the 3-year-old . Mick 's what , 12 ? - MICK : Hmm . - We got an 11 - year-old chum for him . Got an 8-year-old . He 's not very right in the head , but he might get over it . I had a son . Peter . I don 't know if he 's alive or dead . He was at school when it all started , and they went into the open country . I was on my way home to see if he managed to make his way back there . Well , that 's the only way of finding out . But I must tell you , with our 12 people and their case histories , no two members of the same family have survived anywhere . In fact , no two people who knew each other , or knew of each other , have survived . But you don 't know for sure . And even it 's only a million-to-one chance , it could come up . Yes . Well , I 'll come with you tomorrow , and then I 'll go off on my own . I 'll come back later . I hope you do . ( CHUCKLES ) We 'll have a welcoming party tomorrow . We 'll build the biggest bonfire you ever saw , Mick . And we 'll dance if you 'll play for us , Greg , and we 'll call it " The February Welcome " . - Would you like that ? - Yes . What 's your story , Mick ? - Were you at school ? - Yeah . Carlton Park Comprehensive . How many were there ? About 2,000 . I got it first , just for a day . Then I got better . My folks didn 't . Then I got ... Well ... When I was up and around , I went to see my friends . Must have been terrible . Yes . Yes . Yes , it was terrible . ( CRYING ) What do you think it was , fun ? It was bloody hell terrible . I was running and cycling and nobody heard me . Come on , boy . ( GREG SIGHING ) Well , leave him . He 's got to cry . He 'll come back . He needs us . Sorry for being stupid . I was thinking of my own son . Things people say are very important . I always try to greet a stranger in a way that takes away suspicion . Hmm . My name 's Loraine , you need us , we need you . CHARLES : Yeah , and with a real stranger , you say it for real . Before asking questions , always open up . Give information about yourself , let them see there 's no danger and then ask about health . Can I ask about something ? - CHARLES : Of course . - What 's the date ? 24th of February . - Oh , I 've missed it . - CHARLES : What ? My birthday ! ( CHUCKLING ) Oh , Jenny . Well , dates are important . We need to know when to reap . When to sow . How to use a table of tides when we come across one . Oh , don 't worry , we 'll find you watches with dates . Have you any idea what the actual survival rate is ? No , not really . In the area I 've surveyed , we 15 people are the remains of about 75,000 . - Just one in 5,000 ? - About . And if it 's the same all over , the population of the British Isles is about 10,000 people . Now , I reckon we 've got enough remains of civilisation to last for about two generations . If we survive the next year or two , and gather our crops , and keep the livestock alive through the winter , and beat the rats and get next season 's crop planted and make very sure that there is a next generation , we 'll survive . If we use our logic . ( LAUGHS ) And we 're being helped . I found that with the scarcity of people and the problems , everybody loves everybody . ( MICK COUGHING ) - Sorry , Mick . - It 's all right . Well , bedtime ? Yes . Abby and I have got our things in the tent . We 've got a lovely bed here . CHARLES : Where 're you going to sleep , Mick ? It 's all right , he can come in the car with me . You can have one end and I 'll have the other . - CHARLES : All right ? - Yeah , thanks . Oh , it 's all right , we know where to put the things . It 's nice , isn 't it ? He 's got the answer , hasn 't he ? Yes . Aren 't you sure ? ( CLICKING TONGUE ) Yes , I 'm sure . ( SIGHING ) It 's just that I was thinking about that boy , Mick . All that he 's been through . All those surviving children . You mean , Peter ? ( SIGHING ) Babies can 't have come through . Not many young children . Even if we do survive , there 'll be a missing generation . How do you feel about giving birth , Jen ? I don 't fancy it . Do you ? Well , there won 't be much point in getting through the next few years without children . We need some of Charles ' cold logic . I 'm not ready for cold logic . Survival can wait for a bit . ( HORSE SNORTING ) Here we are , boy . CHARLES : Hello ! Where are you ? Isla , where is everybody ? - Ill . - What ? All of them ? I expect Des and Florence are dead . Catching fish in the river day before yesterday . Fried ' em ... I don 't like fish . And they ate them day before yesterday . Well , uh , you better come in . ( MAN GROANING IN PAIN ) ( WOMAN CRYING ) WOMAN : Charles , eat something . ( BOY GROANING ) ( WOMAN CRYING ) Eat something . Well , they 're all up there . I don 't know . I don 't like fish . Corn dolly . Have you seen one of them ? - Yes . - Charles made that . I know he did . I watched him do it . He hung it up there . And I told him . I said , " They 're for when the harvest 's home . " That 's when you hang up a corn dolly . Not winter . Not when you 're threshing to get a few handfuls of corn for bread . Oh , I don 't know . ( SIGHING ) They said it was the fish . - You didn 't have it ? - I don 't like it . They 'll live . They 've nothing left to sick up now . It 's further down . Trout ... Where is it , Isla ? The remains ? Well , I burnt them . ( CHARLES SIGHING ) Could be industrial waste . Could have come from the sea . Bacteria ... Maybe some residue from the plague , degraded viruses ... I don 't know what ! ( SIGHING ) Abby , could you face going up there and hold hands , soothe brows ? Yes , of course I 'll go . - Greg ? - Yeah . Can you manage the horses ? - Well ... - CHARLES : Oh , never mind . Well , I can feed them , groom them . No , I 'd rather you went up there . The horses will survive and anyway , they 're replaceable . I 'll ... I 'll turn them on the lawn , they 'll feed themselves . Yeah , well , look , is there anything that I can do ? Don 't worry , Greg , we 've all got work to do . First , we 'll eat . Then Isla will show you the corn . - For threshing ? - Yes , and grind some , too . We 'll have some bread and some eggs . There 's milk not used in the dairy . Shall I fetch it ? Yes . - Uh , I 'll do that . - Thank you . Get the eggs , Loraine . You know , I 'd ... I 'd be happy to start without bothering ... Now , don 't be noble , Greg . We 'll get some food in you , we need that corn . ( ISLA GRUNTS ) Uh , Mick , there are some knives in that draw there , would you get them , please ? I 'm going into Minton . Tell Abby . - Going into a town ? - Oh , I 'll be careful . The library there has more medical books than the local one . And more chemists . Charles has gone to get medicine . He 'll be back soon . ( MOANING ) Can you hear me ? Oh , Tessa , I know it 's sore , but you 'll soon be better . - ( PANTING ) Tell him ... - Yes ? Tell him ... Tell him what ? Tessa , what shall I tell him ? ( VOICE SHAKING ) Yes . Yes ? You 're going to be all right . Charles will be back soon . ( MAN MOANING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( SNEEZING ) ( JENNY CHUCKLING ) ( ALL LAUGHING ) - Here , I 'll take it . - Right . Here , then . Give me your flour , then . That 's it . There you go . How do you make these corn dollies , then ? - Don 't you make another one . - Ah , it 's just a superstition . ( ISLA SCOFFS ) - It 's a fertility symbol . - Is it ? Mmm . Sort of harvest goddess or something like that . Goes back thousands of years BC . ( CAR APPROACHING ) Another three . A girl , Tessa , she wanted to tell you something . - And a man . - Edward . And the child . The other three are in agony . They 're getting weaker . Can you use a hypodermic ? - No . - CHARLES : Jenny ? I shouldn 't think so , she was a secretary . No . I 've had it done to me a few times . What is it ? It 's nothing to cure them , I don 't know how . - It 's just something to ease the pain . - What ? Compassion , loving kindness . Morphine . - Will you help me , Abby ? - To kill them ? They 're being killed by what was in the fish . I 'm taking away the pain . Please , help me , Abby . You won 't need me . # In all the days of danger disaster and distress # All the ways of woe and oh , so much unhappiness # People full of sorrow all know hope in their way ... # Have a nice line in elderflower . Tastes rather like port . Hmm . Last summer . # But they keep on going reaping and sowing ... # - What about Mick ? - Yes , please . Hey , you 've had beer . I know . I want some of that . I was a hardened drinker . Well , a little won 't hurt him . - I 've had a hard day , you know . - Exactly , you 'll go out like a light . All right , then I 'll go out like a light . Well , you see how that goes first . Jenny ? # They 'll keep on going ... # They 're quiet . Sleeping . JENNY : My turn . # Keep on giving Loving and living # Like birds in the trees or bees in the honey hives # All things are still All things asleep ... # Abby , could you come and talk with me for a minute , please ? # Shepherds and their sheep # And summers few # And summers few # Sleep little one # Sleep safe and warm # - CHARLES : You 're going home tomorrow . - Yes . You know , the chances of finding Peter alive anywhere are infinitesimal . - Yes , I know . - Still , it 's right to try . You keep to the side roads . I 'll draw you a map . I 've already done that . ( CHARLES CHUCKLES ) ( SIGHS ) - Abby will you come back ? - I intend to . - Tomorrow ? - I might stay the night . I don 't know . - Please come back . - Yes , all right . - Are you staying on here ? - Oh , yes , I must . I know the soil and what grows . And the livestock . There 's enough around here to maintain a settlement , and I must stay and keep it going . Abby , wherever you go , would you put up more notices ? I wrote off 50 more maps on the duplicator . Could you , when you put one up , check where you are and put a cross ? Yes , of course . I must build up again . You 've had an unbearable load . Heavy . Not unbearable . I only knew those people a few weeks . Abby , will you promise to come back ? I would if I knew what was going to happen tomorrow or the next day . I want to come back . I expect to be back . You 're the right kind of material . I want to make a survivor out of you . Abby , you must get pregnant . Yes , well , I 'll think about it . No , the time to think about it is afterwards . While biology is helping not just you , but the whole human species to survive . I 'll think about that , too . - Abby ... - Let go . No , Abby . Survive . Survive , Abby . I love you . Oh , I was coming to bed . Loraine , would you sleep in the house tonight , please ? I need solitude . Right . Don 't go , Abby . ( DOOR SLAMMING ) - You 're back . - Yes , I 'm back . - He 's having solitude . - Yes . I 'm going to have his baby . - Doesn 't take many words to say that . - Well , it 's true . - Does he know ? - Of course he knows . Tessa was going to have his child . - No , not his . - She wanted to tell him . No , that 's not true . I 'm carrying his child . I 've never had a child before . Never had a man before and I 'm 35 . Well , that 's all right . You 've got to have children . There 's no life without children . So I 'm looking forward to that . ( COCK CROWING ) CHARLES : Pack it , will you , Mick ? It 's got to burn quickly . Ah ! Good girls . Right . Mick , will you go get the paraffin from the yard ? Abby , I 'm coming , too . I don 't want to stay here any more . I had a long talk with Greg last night . He 's still deciding . He 's so useful to Charles he doesn 't see how he can leave . You 're not coming back , are you ? - Is it all right if I come with you ? - Yes , of course it is . I 've just been talking to Greg . He says he 's going with you . Jenny , I can 't afford to lose him , will you please talk to him ? I don 't know what I can do . We did talk for an hour or so last night . I can 't say to someone else what they should do , because I don 't know . - But don 't you see , I need him . - Yes . I 'm sorry , I have no hold over Greg . - He 's going because you 're going . - Oh . - Is there nothing between you ? - No . Well , I don 't know . No , there isn 't really . I need you , too , Jenny . Please don 't go . - I 'm sorry . - Stay here . Stay with Greg , anyone , it doesn 't matter . But it does matter , now , that we have children . Jenny , you 've got to understand . Abby , tell her , there is a compelling urgency for that ! I 'm not coming back . ( SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION ) You can 't survive on a day-to-day basis . You 've got to plan ahead to next year , and to 20 years , and to 50 years ahead . I tried to make four women conceive . Tessa and Florence have died . And I 'll be lucky if the other two have live infants and they survive to maturity , but I 'll go on trying . In love . Love ? Yes , love . Love is dependence . Love is mutual survival . Not for me . Not yet . Are you going ? When you put up notices , could you please add , " Don 't eat fish . " Yes , I 'll do that . Here 's a pen . Will you help me for just one more hour , Greg ? To take a stretcher , Greg , to and from the sleeping room . ( CAR ENGINE STARTING )

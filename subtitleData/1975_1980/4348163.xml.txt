 - Your own sister 's a pilot and a warrior . - She 's my sister , not my wife-to-be ! Felgercarb ! This disease has swept through every pilot . Remember , you 're flying a viper . Just think what you want it to do . They send out patrols , do they not ? Capture one ! 'There are those who believe 'that life here began out there , 'far across the universe , 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans . 'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens . ' Serina , this was a wonderful repast . You outdid yourself . I didn 't do anything . In fact , I 'm all thumbs . - If it hadn 't been for Athena ... - You should see her . Believe me , I am an expert in the art of culinary graces . - You 're a genuine find . - Yes , she certainly ... And if I were a hundred yahrens younger ... But some young man will soon fall into the lap of early glory . I was told in instructional period that some people are just naturally slow . That doesn 't mean they 're stupid . They 're just slow . You know the real problem with cooking like this ? Couple of meals a day , you couldn 't climb into a cockpit . Exactly . That is exactly the trouble . You two are the next on patrol . I don 't wish to bring this momentous evening to an end but we have been gorging ourselves on this delicious food for nigh on three millicentons , waiting ... All right . All right . Serina and I have decided - that is , if Boxey is willing and supportive - we would like very much to be married . Yay ! - Oh , I 'm so happy for you . - Thank you . - I didn 't think you 'd get around to it . - Neither did I. I hope we have your blessing , Commander . My dear , you not only have my blessing , you have the blessings of the Lords of Kobol . - Congratulations , my son . - Thank you , Father . You 've made a father very happy . Well , as best man , I 've got to see to the groom 's sendoff preparations . Going to be a real bash . Thanks for the food . I hate to run . Pleasure dining with you . Don 't forget our patrol . Congratulations , Serina . Athena ... Bye . All I did was smile . Athena , Starbuck has a well-defined sense of what lies in waiting . That 's what makes him such a good advance scout . Section 12 , launch bay Alpha , stand by to launch . 'Fighter Patrol 2 , acknowledge when ready . ' - Stand by to launch Fighter Patrol 1 . - So many times I couldn 't count ' em . Starbuck , you sound like it 's all ending . This is a routine patrol to see what 's in front of the fleet . That 's what I mean . See , this patrol , it 's ... it 's , er ... It 's kind of the last one we 'll ever have as ... Well , you know . - The way we are . - Are you jealous ? Yeah , I guess in a way I am . Don 't tell anyone else , huh ? No , I won 't tell anybody else . You know something ? I think what you 're trying to say is pretty nice . We 've had a lot of good times . Transferring launch control to viper fighters . Patrol 2 , launch when ready . 'Launch viper fighter Patrol 1 . Launch when ready . ' I have examined your epistle suggesting you can locate the humans . Why , yes ... Oh , yes . I ... I think ... as they do ! I ... I ... I know where they will go , what they must do . I find your reasoning logical . Then ... - I am to be ... - Spared . To serve the Empire ! Lucifer ... I 'm sending you a base ship entirely under your command . It will be my pleasure , Baltar . I think I can assure you , with some sense of pride , you will inherit the most capable Centurions in all the Empire . 'So many good times together . ' - Starbuck , I 'm not dying . - No ... not exactly . I 've thought a lot about what I 'm doing and I 've never been happier about anything in my whole life . Starbuck ... I got it . My panel 's lighting up like a meteor fire . Apollo . Dead ahead . It 's almost black out there . Like a dead sea . I 've never seen anything like it . Neither have the instruments . There 's nothing to lock onto . The sensors are lost . This is no place to bring the fleet . I 'll see how far we can go without getting lost . I 'll see what 's on the other side of this void . You may not find your way back . 'Let me do it . You 've got somebody waiting for you ... ' Apollo ! Don 't go too far . I 'm barely holding a fix on the way back . 'Apollo ! ' Felgercarb . 'Incredible . It 's an ocean of darkness . ' Nothing as far as the eye can see . No stars , moons , planets , nothing . 'Apollo , I can barely read you . Turn around . ' Keep talking , I 'm using your voice as a navigational fix . 'Apollo , I can 't ... ' 'Changing wavelengths . Can you read me , Apollo ? Over . ' Starbuck ? Starbuck ? Apollo , is anything wrong ? I 'm as far out as I can go without losing my fix on our return . Should I come out to find you ? Do you read me ? 'Apollo ? ' Oh , frack . Lords of Kobol , is this what I think it is ? Oh ! This will be the best bachelor sendoff ever . - Where did you get this ? - Not here . You 'll get us moduled . - Hey , security 's coming ! - Here . Hurry . Stand alert ! Well , it looks as if we 're having a festivity . Has this been approved ? Where are you getting your victuals ? Who is responsible for this ? I am . - What do you want , Lieutenant ? - Colonel Tigh . Excuse me . I ... I mean , we were just doing our duty . Some ale and Ambrosa has disappeared from the officers ' ration and ... Yes ? Obviously , if Galactica 's executive officer is in charge , there 's no reason for any further questions . - By your leave ? - Dismissed . There 's only one thing worse than lifting rations . - Do you know what that is ? - No , sir . It 's getting caught lifting rations . Do I make myself clear ? - Yes , sir . - Good . Captain Apollo and Starbuck should be returning from patrol any time now . Let 's see to it that things are in full swing . All right ! Omega , patrol status , please . Captain Apollo 's patrol is still beyond scanning range . That 's odd . Probe 1 to Galactica . Do you read ? Come in , Starbuck . Apollo , do you read ? Do you read ? OK , I 'm about to disobey orders so if you want to stop me , you 've got one millicenton . Then I 'm going to barrel ahead at full turbo , firing my lasers . I 'll either find you or we 'll both be lost . If I do find you , I 'm going to execute a perfect 180-degree turn and head out the way I came in . So follow me and we 'll have a pretty good chance . Any objections ? Good . I knew you 'd approve . Here goes nothing . Probe 1 to Galactica , do you read ? Come in , Starbuck . Come in , Starbuck . 'Probe ... Galactica ... Do you read ? ' Come in , Starbuck . - Probe 1 , this is Probe 2 . - Starbuck ? - I 'm on my way . - How ? You 'll be as lost as I am . As soon as you see me , fire off a laser volley . I 'll pull up , swing around and head back out on one line . I gotcha ! - What are you using as a fix ? - The end of my nose . I was good at this at the Academy , so don 't disorient me . Don 't chat and stay tucked in . We 're going home . - Ten , nine , eight , seven ... - How far in was I ? Don 't talk . Six , five , four , three , two , one ... zero . And you owe me a fumarello . Phew ! Let 's go home , buddy . 'Picking up some crazy readings off that asteroid . Let 's take a look . ' Pods . I don 't make ' em . They 're there . Look at the hairline aperture running from the rock face to the floor of the valley . I would have missed it . Jolly , if we miss just one of these Cylon outposts , we 'll never know what hit us . Is it operational ? It looks deserted . Think of it as a crawlon in its web . Nothing moves until some hapless creature flies into its orbit and then it 's all over . - Should we get closer , count the ships ? - It doesn 't matter . It only takes one to notify the Cylon capital . Let 's get the ... Their ships have turned away from the fleet . That 's good . We 'll have time to warn the Galactica . Let 's get out of here without getting spotted . By your command . - Speak . - I bring good news . We believe we have located the Battlestar Galactica . Oh ? A scouting expedition of Colonial vipers has landed on a listening post in the quadrant Otarsis . They were permitted to escape , as you instructed . - How far is this outpost from us ? - 1.5 hectares . Since the Galactica is kept to a minimum speed by the slower vehicles under her protection , at light speed we can easily catch her within a centon . - Is she aware she 's been detected ? - No . Our fighters will take her by complete surprise . As they did at Carillon ? Hmm ? One base star is not sufficient to assure victory over the Galactica . Find her but follow just beyond her scanner range . Until we can call for reinforcements ? Such a call would surely be picked up by the Galactica . She would be alerted and escape . - Logical . - Yes . Now perhaps you see why the Imperious Leader put me in command . But if we cannot call for assistance and you will not attack , is not the end result the same ? The Galactica escapes . Have faith , Lucifer . Have faith . I have a plan . All I need is the opportunity to present it . - And that will come . - By your command . Commander , Patrol 1 reporting in . They 're a centon out from the fleet . They 're late . Have them report to me . - What about Patrol 2 ? - Boomer is holding on the outer marker . Holding ? I want him in . We 're flying blind . Alpha Patrol , you 're clear to land . Thank you . Let 's put ' em in , Jolly . 'Jolly , do you hear me ? Jolly , are you all right ? Jolly ? ' Get your nose up . That cadet made a better approach than you . - ' What ? ' - Get your nose up and steady up . - You all right ? - I don 't know . I 've got a buzzing in my ears . I feel woozy . Better get your breathing gear checked with the lab . Probably leaking carbide . That is , if you land . Now get that nose up . - A Cylon outpost ? - ' It 's well hidden but there . ' - Thank you , Lieutenant . - ' By your leave , sir . ' Hm . Colonel . Notify helm and plotting that we 'll change course to this quadrant . Without waiting for Captain Apollo 's report on that sector ? We know we can 't go back , we know what 's in this sector . Let 's hope Apollo 's report is more optimistic . Commander , Captain Apollo 's probe approaching Galactica . - Excellent . Call him to the bridge . - Yes , sir . Hey ! All right ! Boomer , you OK ? Hey , Boomer . What 's wrong ? 'Boomer ? ' Come on . The Colonel 's watching us . Quit clowning around ! 'With Captain Apollo returning late , I wished to extend the curfew . ' But if you men are falling down drunk ... I am not drunk , sir . I just got a little dizzy . Any more " dizziness " and I 'll send everyone back to quarters . - Understood ? - ' Understood . ' Hey , look , it 's not my fault . I ... Hey , Boomer ! Sit down . Just sit down here . Relax , man , relax . We all know those deep patrols are too long . I don 't understand it . I was feeling fine and then ... Phew . What were the symptoms when he reported to the life station ? Dizziness , rapid pulse , escalating internal temperature . It 's risen two points since I called you . He was on deep probe and skipped decontamination . He what ? There 's a party going on for Apollo , a sendoff . He didn 't want to miss it . That 's just splendid . Don 't these warriors realise what one errant virus or bacteria , for which we have no immunity , could do to our people ? Get this man in a support chamber , quickly . Quickly ! Thanks a lot . A buddy has to make a guy comfortable in his last few hours . Listen . After decontamination , there 's something I want to show you . Every man , woman and child in the fleet could die . I don 't know what got into them - maybe the excitement of the party . Excitement of the party ? Come on , Colonel . Security ! I want everyone who 's been in contact with Flight Sergeant Jolly and Lieutenant Boomer under strict quarantine ! This better be good . I 'm delaying a reunion . I promise you a night you will remember . Don 't touch that door ! The three of you , back in that room ! Tell my staff to get isolation chambers here quickly ! What is it ? What happened ? Maybe the end of us all . Doctor , the new patient just went critical . Lower his cryo tube temp to minus 72 . And increase his Isoldin intravenous feed six units per centon . Of all the stupid blunders ! The important thing now is to recover . To avoid the Cylon outpost , we 'll be going along the route you explored . - We can 't go that way . - We can 't ? There 's something more dangerous than a Cylon outpost - a magnetic sea as endless as anything I 've ever seen . What do you mean ? Magnetic sea ? A void so far across we couldn 't scan the other side . It ruined my sensors . If Starbuck hadn 't come after me , I couldn 't have made it back . Well , we can 't go that way . What if we were to skirt around the void , follow its perimeter ? Commander ? Commander ? I 'll be in my quarters . Maintain this course . But we 're heading for the void . I suggest ... You have your orders , Colonel . Zap , zap ! Come on , Muffit . Up , Muffit . Up , Muffit . Apollo ! - Hey , Boxey , how are you ? - Fine . Your mom here ? Sorry , Muffit . - Your mom here ? - She 's in there putting ... What 's this , secrets ? I bet I know . She 's trying on her gown for the wedding . I 'm not supposed to see it , right ? - Sort of . - Apollo ? - I 'll be right out . - Don 't worry , it 's not bad luck to see the bride before her wedding day . Flight Cadet Serina reporting for duty , Captain . - What is this , a joke ? - No . I just wanted to surprise you . I 've been in training ever since Adama opened up the programme - to replace the pilots we lost . - Training ? In training to ... A shuttle cadet ... who has just finished her first solo . Would you excuse us for a centon , Boxey ? OK . Come on , Muffit . They 're gonna argue . We are not going to argue . - Yes , they are . - Yes , we are . You didn 't even tell me . No one did . Does my father know ? No , he doesn 't get a report on every cadet in the fleet . - I won 't let you do it . - You have no choice . - We 're about to be married ! - What does that have to do with it ? - Your own sister 's a pilot and a warrior . - She 's my sister , not my wife-to-be ! If that 's what it 's about , we can take care of that . Serina ! Don 't you understand ? I love you . I don 't want anything to happen to you . Don 't you think I love you , too ? You go flying off on missions in your viper , into combat . I 'll just be a shuttle pilot . Do you know how many we lost on Carillon ? Do you know how many civilians ? There is no safe place anywhere in the fleet . Everybody 's being trained in every capacity . It 's the only way if we 're gonna survive . Are you any good ? Top of the class . You 'd better be . You 're gonna be married to a squadron commander . Yes , sir . Get this man on the line right away . He 's critical . Excuse me , Cassiopeia . Doctor . This disease has swept through every fighter pilot and half the bridge officers - everyone who had contact with anyone at that party . I can 't isolate it . Cryogen tubes . I had no choice . They 'd be dead if not in cryogenic suspension . It 's only delaying the inevitable unless I can isolate the source of that infection , soon . And Doctor , you understand the significance of these men ? They are not just individuals . They 're our only means of defence . I understand all that , Commander . And that 's your problem . Mine is keeping them alive . " After their home planet Kobol was known to be doomed , " the people set forth across a great void which seemed endless , " until a bright shining star appeared and guided them to safety . " Enter . You sent for me , Father ? Yes , Apollo . Colonel Tigh has prepared a roster of everyone in the fleet who 's had flight experience . It comes down to a few old-time warriors with various disabilities and the group at the bottom of the list . - Oh , no . - I 'm afraid so . I want you to get them combat-ready as quickly as possible . - You 're not serious ? - I 'm deadly serious . The viper 's the most advanced flying machine ever designed by man . You don 't just turn one over to a shuttle pilot . Would you prefer to turn the Galactica over to the Cylons without a fight ? I don 't know when we 'll get our fighter pilots back , if we ever do . - It 's that serious ? - It 's that serious . I don 't mean to be brusque but I have many things to do . - You have your orders , Captain . - Yes , sir . But it ... Yes , sir . I don 't believe you 've read all the names on that roster , Commander . Oh , Lord . Now , I know you shuttle pilots have never had a pressure suit on before . But a viper isn 't a shuttle . Without this suit , you can 't survive the G-forces you 'll pull under combat . As soon as you 're into your uniforms , move through to the simulators . - Captain . - Oh , yes , Cadet Serina ? I love you . Um ... Yes , that 's very good . Um , Starbuck ... Yo . Number 18 just went critical . Same procedure . I 'm not going to find the answer here . Scanners indicate the void is infinite . Not infinite , just beyond our scanner 's ability to probe the other side . - Excuse me . - Oh , Doctor ... Is there any possibility ... How soon can some of our pilots be returned to duty ? It 's not a matter of how soon they will return to duty , it 's a matter of how soon they will die . I want permission to return to wherever the two warriors landed . If I can isolate the source of the infection ... Doctor , that asteroid is a parsec behind us and has a Cylon sentinel post . We can 't go back . With only two vipers for cover , it would be suicide . The health team is willing to take that chance . I appreciate that , Doctor , but I must agree with Colonel Tigh . I can 't grant permission , not without the proper escort . Commander , going back there is the only hope those boys have . - The only hope ? - The only hope , sir . - What is the status of Blue Squadron ? - Still in simulators . Doctor , prepare your team and report back to me . Very good , sir . Let 's hope and pray our shuttle pilots can fly those vipers . - ' Stick on my tail . I 'm on him . ' - Right behind you , Starbuck . 'My laser pump 's jammed . You have to take him . ' I got him . I got him ! I did it ! 'You sure did . You got the Cylon . ' - And me . - What ? After blasting him , you crossed my tail still firing . I 'm dead . - I 'm sorry . - You 're sorry ? All right , girls , I 'll explain it one more time . 'Captain Apollo , report to the bridge . Captain Apollo , report to the bridge . ' Run the next one through . - And try not to get killed this time . - Yeah , right . Commander . Well , Captain , how are your shuttle pilots doing ? Fine , considering the closest they 've been to a viper was probably at an Armament Day display . Dr Salik wants to send a medical team back to the asteroid where the disease was contracted . It 's the only way to find the root cause and a cure . That 's a one-way mission . There 's a Cylon listening post there . We 'd have to send at least one squadron as escort . At least . And since there 's only two of us , there 's ... The shuttle pilots haven 't even launched in a real viper yet . You said they were doing fine . Yes , but a long way from being able to fly a real mission . It 's too risky . Everything we do has an element of risk . - They 're shuttle pilots . - They 're warriors . And all warriors know they may have to sacrifice their lives . But not throw them away . What do you estimate the losses might be ? If I run into Cylons , I could lose the entire squadron . Or you could leave the lesser-qualified pilots behind . I appreciate what you 're saying , Father , but if I hold one of them back , I should hold them all back . In my opinion , not one of them is qualified for this mission ! Thank you , Captain . It will be so logged . Medical shuttle taking off from flight deck one . 'Will rendezvous with Blue Squadron at coordinates Alpha 37 . ' Coordinates Alpha 37 confirmed . Transferring launch control to viper fighters . 'Launch when ready . ' All right , girls , just like we did it in the simulators . Remember , these controls are as sensitive as a schoolgirl 's ... lips . Blue Squadron , let 's show the fleet how a launch is done . Blue Squadron leader launching . 'Brie , what 's wrong ? You 're losing it . Get control ! ' Back on the power . 'Back on the power ! ' 'Hit your auto-control ! Brie , hit your power control . ' 'You did it , Brie . You did it ! ' Blue Squadron launched . Easy , Deitra . You 're coming up too fast . That 's better . Watch your spacing , Serina . Wingmen , stick tight to your leaders . By your command . We are trailing just beyond the Galactica 's scanner range . Excellent . She has veered away from the outpost . - Quite logical . - On the contrary , quite illogical . They are heading into the Epsilon Quadrant , towards a magnetic abyss . - A magnetic abyss ? - A void . A navigational inferno . Possibly endless . They should engage our small outpost rather than enter such a dangerous area . Unless they know we 're following . Anything is possible but the odds are astronomically against it . Shall we launch our fighters against the Galactica now ? No . Have they sent out reconnaissance patrols ? Occasionally . We dropped back beyond their scanner range . Give top priority to capturing one of those patrol pilots . If I am right , Adama will turn the Galactica over to me without firing a shot . By your command . Isn 't he wonderfully devious ? We can learn much from him . - Asteroid on my scanner . Sector Delta 5 . - Got it . Hold the squadron at Omega 4 . I 'll approach from the other side . If I can surprise them , maybe I can take out the sentinel before they scramble fighters . Then we won 't have to risk the squadron . We should all go at once . We are capable of handling ... Demonstrate your capabilities by following orders . - Yes , sir . - Here I go . Good luck , Captain . Starbuck . Brie . I 'm picking up a blip on the scanner . Rear Quadrant Tau . That would be the shuttle . It 's ours . I don 't think so . It 's closing in on us . I told them to hold position . Oh , frack ! Deitra , take command . We 've got a Cylon on our tail . Form on me . Let 's go , girls . - Athena , what are you doing ? - I 'm your wingman . A wingman should stick to a leader . OK , OK . Just hold back a little . - And for Sagan 's sake , don 't shoot me . - Keep it up , Starbuck . Keep it up . Colonial vipers . Warn the base . 'Hit your turbo ! ' 'Hit your reverse thrusters ! ' Fire , Starbuck , fire . - Beautiful . - Save it . They 've warned the outpost . 'Apollo 's going to need help . ' Frack ! 'Blue Squadron , Apollo . They 're launching . ' The air will soon be full of Cylons ! Return to Galactica ! Return to Galactica ! After this run , Captain . I got him . Oh , felgercarb ! Easy , Brie , I got him . That 's two . Stay on ' em , I 'm going for the launch bay . Nice shooting , Captain . Thank you , Lieutenant . Serina ? - Right here . - Where 's Starbuck ? He turned on a Cylon fighter . He left me in command . I thought you needed support . You thought right . Good job . Medical shuttle , the asteroid is secure . Prepare to land . Commander , Blue Squadron reports mission successful , no casualties . Good . As soon as the squadron has landed , order all ships to close on the Galactica and slow to probe speed . We 're not going into the void ? Tigh , the Cylon outpost , I 'm sure , has alerted every nearby base . The darkness of the void may give us some cover . If there are any of us left to find . We 're going in . His reaction to the news will be interesting to observe . - By your command . - Speak . Vipers from the Galactica have destroyed our outpost . The Galactica is on her way over the outpost now ? - No . - No ? She is instead entering the void . Why bother risking detection by destroying the outpost if they had no intention of moving in that direction , unless ... unless Adama needs something from the asteroid . Food , fuel ? There are no such supplies there . There is one other ... curious matter to report . What is it ? The Colonial viper craft reportedly flew in a peculiarly erratic fashion . Evidently they flew well enough to destroy your base . It was a small outpost , caught by surprise , since you determined the Galactica would not strike there . Do not fence with me , my friend . Everything is proceeding according to my plan , except you have not captured one of their pilots as I ordered . To assure such a capture , we would have to risk being discovered . You ordered us out of scanner range . They send out patrols , do they not ? Capture one !

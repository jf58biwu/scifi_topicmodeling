 We 're leaving our star system . They removed the laser generator . Makes sense . Get rid of the laser generators and ... you 're unarmed ! You haven 't helped the Colonies , you 've just kept the enforcers in power ! We must assume a Cylon has captured or killed Lieutenant Starbuck . Cylons ! I told you , he 's a Cylon spy ! If I am , I 'm in big trouble . 'There are those who believe 'that life here 'began out there , 'far across the universe , 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans . 'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens . ' We are nearly through the asteroid dust , Commander . I 'm as nervous as a ... young cadet on his first orbit . I 'm not nervous . I don 't even know what to be nervous about . We 're leaving our star system . When we get through this asteroid dust , there 'll be a new galaxy . One no human in this fleet has seen before . - Commander . - Yes . Hush up . It 's just a bunch of old stars . Perhaps Boxey should take the helm . He has a singular perspective . - Can I ? - No , you cannot . You are centons into your sleep period . - Oh . Commander ? - Keep me out of this , young man . I may be the commander but he 's your father . Thank you . Next time I 'll act excited and maybe we could stay up . Come on , Muffit . - Was I ever like that ? - Worse . Initial readings are negative on any signs of life in the first quadrant , sir . When the fleet has cleared the asteroid dust , concentrate sensors forward - to increase our range . - Yes , sir . - Who 's our volunteer ? - Starbuck . - Starbuck ? - Starbuck ? Volunteer ? I don 't think it was his sense of duty . Father 's idea to reopen the dining lounge on the Rising Star was brilliant . Only the waiting list is a yahren long . The first pilot to fly the new recon viper goes to the head of the list . Let 's not deprecate Starbuck . It could be a dangerous mission . - No , sir . - What 's Starbuck 's status ? He 's due on the Rising Star at any moment . I hope we don 't have to move him to red before he eats . Starbuck did ask me to dinner tonight but ... Well , I do have this duty . I guess he 'll have to eat alone . Well , er ... perhaps this once we can make an exception , hm ? You go ahead and join him . I 'll handle this with Colonel Tigh . I 've sailed the Rising Star hundreds of times . This reminds me of the old days - before the war . Anyhow , look , it may be a while before I get another chance to come here for dinner . Big mission coming up . Do you have a private dining room ? Lieutenant , private rooms are reserved 60 and 70 centares in advance . Well , one can always make arrangements for a warrior on his last night . I don 't like the way he said that . - What 's this about a mission ? - It 's just a routine recon flight but don 't tell him that . Will this do , Lieutenant ? Perfect . And a bottle of your finest Ambrosa . Ambrosa 's as rare as tylinium . I 'll see what I can do , sir . Starbuck ... This is all so beautiful . Most men don 't treat a med technician like this . I think of you only as a woman . A very rare and beautiful woman . I 'll try to live up to that image . Be back in a centon . Commander , the long-range scanner indicates possible life forms . Quadrant Alpha 6 . - Request probe concentration . - Concentration 's approved . - Cylons ? - Impossible to tell . - Prepare Recon Viper 1 . - Yes , sir . Probe indicates definite life signs . Er ... Athena ! I managed to get off work after all . I just didn 't want you to be alone on your last night before ... - You are alone , aren 't you ? - Oh , er ... well , not any longer . Sir ? Yes ? Ah . Listen , there ... You don 't have a room with a better view ? There 's a sanitation ship off our beam . Not exactly appetizing scenery . - A sanitation ship ? Where ? - It must have drifted back . I think there 's a first orbit cadet at the controls . Get me another room . Yes , sir , I quite understand . Good . - Follow me . - Er ... Athena ? Asteroid concentration , binary star system . Alpha 6 , mark 775 . That 's within a hectare of our course . Yes . I hope Lieutenant Starbuck has had time to finish his dinner . Starbuck , these mushies are just heavenly . Oh , er .. No , thanks . Too bad we can 't have any fresh protein with them . I 'll see what I can do . - Wait . Just buzz the waiter . - Oh , no . It 's too slow . I 'll be back in a flash . What happened ? They 're all out of mushies . I 'm sorry . I don 't mind . The protein 's just fine . This stuff 's only a yahren old . Well , I think it has the right effect . So I see . 'Lieutenant Starbuck , report to Battlestar Galactica , flight deck blue . 'Lieutenant Starbuck , report to Battlestar Galactica , flight deck blue , priority red . ' - Oh , Starbuck . - Duty calls , love . Here . Oh ! - Duty calls , love . - I 'm going with you . No . No you 're not . This dinner is costing every cubit I 've got . One of us is going to enjoy it . Don 't move . I want to remember you just as you are . Beautiful against the stars . Sir . Well ... no need for cubits where I 'm going . Thank you , sir . And may I say I admire the lieutenant 's daring . Well , it 's just another mission . No , sir . I 'm referring to the two young ladies . Very pre-war . Why ! Why , that ... ! Oh , well , my , my , my . Don 't we look just precious ? Commander 's orders . In case I have to land . Don 't want everyone to know I 'm a Colonial warrior . Starbuck , you never look like a warrior . Enjoy your dinner ? Well , let 's just say I 'm looking forward to a few centons in space - alone . Just me , a fast ship and a fair galaxy . A fast ship you have . They 've doubled range and speed and installed a voice-activated computer that can outfly the Cylons . Hot pilot doesn 't need all that electronic felgercarb . Switch on your short-range marker beacon so we can track you . No other transmissions unless essential , then only in scrambled code . We don 't want the Cylons tracing you back to us . And , er , Starbuck ... if the Cylons should spot you ... I know . I know , it 's a one-way voyage . Can 't have them tracking me back to the fleet . - Twice as fast ? - You 'll love her . They put a second pulse generator on all engines . - It doesn 't look bigger . - She 's not . You can 't add weight without getting rid of something . - They removed the laser generators . - Oh . Transferring launch control to Recon Viper 1 . Launch when ready . Makes sense . Get rid of the laser generators and ... you 're unarmed ! Wish we were with him . Yeah , so do I. Short-range beacon on and functioning . Recon Viper 1 indicating light speed and accelerating . OK , baby , let 's see what you can do . Whoo ! Fantastic . Incredible . I 'd like to see a computer do that . 'You asked for it . ' Whoa ! - Computer , back to normal track . - ' Your wish is my command , honey . ' - The name 's Starbuck . - ' Don 't be a bore . My name 's CORA . 'Short for Computer Oral Response Activated . 'I 'm programmed to respond instantly to all your needs . 'I 'm also to keep you amused over the duration of our prolonged voyage . 'We 're on a Delta vector for quadrant Alpha 6 . 'I 've activated my sensors and am probing the asteroid area 'where life forms were reported by Galactica 's rather limited scanner . ' - Do I detect jealousy ? - ' Quiet please , I 'm scanning . ' Excuse me . 'I have two unidentified sub-light vehicles bearing Omega 1 , Alpha 6 . 'Shall we investigate ? ' What do we do if they 're Cylons , wave ? 'We have enough speed to outrun anything in the universe . Hang on . 'Slowing to sub-light speed . Let 's not barge in until we know what they are . ' - Who they are . - ' Excuse me . 'I 'm putting them on the screen . Visual contact in . 15 centons . ' - They 're ancient . - ' Sixth millennium fighter craft . 'They 're probably not Cylon . Feel better , honey ? ' No , I don 't like to see any unarmed craft being chased by a fighter . Not this time , Robber . 'May I suggest a high-speed flyby 'kicking in our second booster within 50 metrons ? 'Our backwash should knock him silly 'and scare the pogees out of him . ' - Release controls . - ' Released . ' Croad here . Lost contact . Returning to Proteus . 'You were 52 metrons away when you used your booster . ' - It worked , didn 't it ? - ' Rather sloppily . ' - Listen ... - ' Fighter is disengaging 'and turning for asteroid .71 hectares distant . 'Shuttlecraft has been damaged and is landing on asteroid ahead . - ' What shall we do ? ' - Follow the shuttle . 'May I land us , or do I have to go through a bouncer ? ' Just give me the vector . 'Vector 's displayed . 'Please , try not to jar my chips . 'Switching all systems except marker beacon to standby mode . ' Yo ! You all right ? Drop it . I 'm sorry . I thought you were the pirate that was chasing me . They 're probably from the Frodo system . Nasty bunch . I don 't know why I crossed this asteroid belt . - I said drop it . - I don 't blame you for being cautious . I 'm a shuttle driver with agro parts for the farmers on Crodan . Crodan ? What 's that ? What settlement ? It 's a small , primitive settlement that 's never seen a beauty like the one you 're flying . - You 're not from this system ? - I 'll ask the questions . I know . I just like to know where I stand . Are you a pirate ? You want to check my cargo ? Go on . - It 's not worth much . - Think I will . Uh-uh-uh ! Agro parts for some farmer on Crodan ? Aye , and that , too . This is Ambrosa . It must be more than 50 yahren old . 500 to be exact . Five ... ? That 's impossible . There hasn 't been any of this around the star system since the war . - What star system ? - Where 'd you get this ? It can 't be real . Are you a bootlegger ? Try it . I will . Mmm . By all that 's holy . I got a lot more . If you 'd keep your mouth shut , I 'd be glad to share my find with you . This is worth a fortune . How much is there ? A lot more than you or I could haul out of here . But your ship doesn 't look like it was made for cargo . It looks like ... Now , wait a minute . You 're not the pirate ? You 're not going to kill me ? Well , I didn 't mean to frighten you . I 'm a little leery of pirates myself . I don 't blame you . - How many of those guys are there ? - This is a pretty rough sector . Dozens of asteroids where they can hide and attack an unsuspecting ship . You wouldn 't be an advance scout for some sort of convoy , would you ? No , no , no . This 'd be a very bad place to bring an unarmed ship . That it would . Tell me , what kind of range do you figure those pirates have ? I don 't really know ... I 'm sorry , lad , but that beauty you 're flying is the answer to all my dreams . Commander , short-range beacon indicates Recon Viper 1 climbing back into orbit . Maintain tracking . He may be onto something . 'Finally decided to turn me back on ? - ' Shall I scan for that fighter ? ' - Negative . 'Identify . ' - Are you capable of flying this ship ? - ' Affirmative . - ' Identify . ' - All right , then , control is yours . Assume course to asteroid mass 1.0775 , bearing Delta 7 . 'Computed . Where 's Starbuck ? ' Prepare to transmit intergalactic transmitter reach . 'Displayed . What happened to Starbuck ? ' Stand by to transmit . Commander ! Long-range transmissions being sent by Recon Viper 1 . - Are you sure it 's long-range ? - Narrow beam . - It 's a code but not scrambled . - What 's that fool doing ? - An inoperative short-post transmitter ? - It 's possible , Father . But why an unknown code and unscrambled ? I suggest we check the Cylon codes , sir . Do it . We are picking up a transmission in a strange code . - Launch fighters to investigate . - By your command . No response to known Cylon code patterns . Commander , we must assume a Cylon has captured or killed Lieutenant Starbuck and now has command of Recon Viper 1 . That transmission is being beamed at our old home galaxy . If it 's not a message to the Cylons , it 's a beacon directing them here . That transmission must be stopped . Alert my son . We are to destroy Recon Viper 1 . Can 't we try to make communication first ? If the recon viper starts the pulse generators , we 'll be eating ion vapours . - Captain , Starbuck ... - Probably dead , Boomer . Transferring launch control to viper fighters . Launch when ready . Oh , no . It 's like trying to fly a museum . CORA , where are you when I need you ? Come on , baby , ignite . Orbit . Goodbye , Robber . I 'm not Robber . You 're making a mistake . 'I 'm not Robber . ' All right . Now , you follow me and don 't even think about running . Name 's Starbuck , privateer , Cyranus Galaxy . A little misunderstanding . Easy , easy , easy . I just want to offer you guys a little drink . Look , you 've got me mixed up with another guy . He took my ship and left me with his worthless load of agro parts . Maybe we can make a deal . Long-range transmissions have stopped . Still picking up the short-range beacon . It 's coinciding with that asteroid , bearing Omega 7-5 relative . Let 's hope he stays there till we get there . And then ? We carry out our mission . Twice in one day . It just isn 't fair . What 's happening ? What is this place ? Well , now . What have we here ? What 's your name , lad ? - Starbuck . - Starbuck ? Starbuck , you say , huh ? Hm , that 's strange . Never heard of that one before . To our new mate , Starbuck . Starbuck ! Starbuck ! Ambrosa . And over 100 yahrens old . Yes , yes , but they don 't give us the good stuff . - Where am I ? - Proteus Prison . Oh , I 'm Assault 9 . That 's Forger 7 round the corner there . Embezzler 10 down the block there and Adulteress 58 , I see you 've already met . - Hand it over . - And our , our children , of course . What kind of offence is starbucking ? Sounds interesting . - It 's not an offence . It 's a name . - They 're one and the same , boy . I wonder if our original sinners were as ignorant as this one . - Original sinners ? - Yes , our ancestors . The ones that were first sentenced here . You 're here for crimes committed by your ancestors ? At least we 're not an original sinner like you . Come on , now . What is starbucking ? You can tell us . It 's a name . I 'm just a privateer from another galaxy . Tell me , lad , any news about the war ? - The war ? - Yes . Between the Colonies and the Alliance . You know , we supply Ambrosa for the Colonial warriors . - You what ? - We may be prisoners but we 're as patriotic as any Colonist . We used to supply munitions and Ambrosa for the war effort . When the munitions ran out , we kept on making the only thing we could - Ambrosa . And we 've been making it for 700 yahrens . - Death to the Cylons ! - Death to the Cylons ! Death to the Cylons ! You sent for me ? Yes . Station 8 , please cover long scan . Alpha mode for a centon . Thank you . Come here . Starbuck is on a long-range patrol . We are receiving intermittent transmissions in a code we can 't decipher from his recon viper . Therefore , we can only assume that he is no longer in command . He may be lost ... or dead . In any case , we sent out a patrol to destroy his ship . And even if he 's still alive , without a ship ... he can 't get back . I just thought you should know . - Taking back the scanner . - Athena , thank you . Father , long-range transmissions from Recon Viper 1 resuming . Same frequency and direction . - Apollo 's patrol status ? - They 'll reach their site soon . We 've tried every known military code . We can 't break it . - That 's an Aerian merchant code . - What ? My father was a merchant . I used to transmit for him . That looks like an Aerian merchant code . A merchant code . From the strength of that signal , we 're close . Activating attack computer . Activating attack computer . It 's a request for the coordinates to Aeries ! Countermand the destruct orders . 'Blue Squadron patrol , disengage your attack . ' - The Galactica 's countermanding . - Pulling up . Boomer , he 's landing . Let 's investigate . It must be a human who doesn 't know that Aeries is in Cylon hands . - Have Apollo investigate with caution . - Yes , sir . Tell him to stop that transmission . Thank you for your help . Well , you just saved some Aeries ' life and maybe Starbuck 's . Let 's hope so . Of course , it won 't change anything when he gets back . I wouldn 't want it any other way . Looks deserted . Only one way to find out . He 's been stripping the ship , making room for cargo . - We 're not going to find anything here . - Uh-uh , my turn . You 've been around Starbuck too long . Forgot how to take orders . Thanks . - That sure isn 't Starbuck . - Don 't bet on it . Ready ? Go ! - There he goes . - Don 't shoot , he 's human . No ! Apollo ! There 's a woman and child here ! Don 't hurt them . Do what you want with me but don 't hurt my wife and child . I 'm begging you . My father taught me the merchant code like his father taught him . Our original sinner was an Aerian robber . These enforcers , their ancestors were the original guards ? In a strange way , those swine are as trapped as we are . Why didn 't you make for Aeries when you escaped from prison ? - I didn 't have a capable ship . - Till you stole Starbuck 's viper . He did it for Tania , so he did . We couldn 't stand seeing her raised in that prison . I think I would have done the same . Scanners indicate three Cylon fighters emerging from the asteroid dust cloud . Omega , transfer long-range scanners to my console , please . - Transferring . - They 're not following us . They 're heading for the asteroid where Recon Viper 1 landed . And Apollo 's patrol . They must be scanning a narrow beam or they 'd have picked us up . Colonel ... bring the fleet to flank speed ... and set a new course . Put as much space as possible between ourselves and those fighters . Commander , Apollo 's patrol won 't know where to find us . Set the course , please . Yes , sir . Well . Well , now , we have visitors . What are you doing up at this time of night ? I don 't sleep too good when my father isn 't on board . When is he coming back ? Well ... you know your father 's away on a very , very important mission . It may be a little while yet . But I miss him and so does Muffit . Don 't you , Muffit ? Yes , I 'm sure you do miss him . Do you miss him ? Yes , very much . You know , when your father was as old as you are now ... sometimes , when he couldn 't sleep , he 'd come into my room and climb into bed with me , and I 'd tell him stories . - Would you like me to tell you a story ? - Yeah . - Tell me a story about Earth . - Oh , about Earth . All right . Now , Earth ... is a beautiful , blue-white planet ... Take your bottle , Bootlegger . The name 's Starbuck . From now on your name is Bootlegger 137 . Put that on . You 'd better learn not to argue with an enforcer . Now , take that bottle ! - Go back . Go back . - Close it ! Close that door . That 's an order ! Close it ! - You want to enforce it ? - Close it , man ! Go back , man ! Go back , man ! Go back ! Close the door ! Are all the doors unlocked ? They haven 't worked in generations . - Then come out . - No , no , we can 't ! - No , no , no . - We 're prisoners . Our fathers were prisoners . Our mothers were prisoners . It is the way of the universe . Felgercarb ! You have rights , freedom . You 're human beings ! If you want to live in an Ambrosa stupor , fine , but what about your children ? Oh , they will contribute as we have - making Ambrosa for the Colonial warriors . All the Ambrosa ever made here is ageing on the loading docks ! The Colonies long ago forgot these penal asteroids even exist . They thought they were lost early in the war ! He lies . Tell us the last time a Colonial freighter docked here . Silence him . You haven 't helped the Colonies , you 've just kept the enforcers in power ! - You daggits . - Back in your cell , Assault 9 ! - Is what he says true ? - He 's a dirty , lying bootlegger ! - I am a Colonial warrior . - Warrior ? Show us the loading docks , Croad . Go back in your cells ! All of you ! Man , liberation is great , huh ? Oh , by God , lad , I never thought in my lifetime I 'd smell the sweet smell of air ! That 's freedom . How ... how much Ambrosa do you figure is out here ? The labour of a thousand lifetimes . Cylons ! I told you , he 's a Cylon spy ! If I am , I 'm in big trouble . Those are Colonial vipers . - Apollo ! - Starbuck ! Apollo , this asteroid is piled high with Ambrosa ! Thousands , millions of crates of it . Some of it ageing a millennium . I give up . I just give up . No , you don 't understand . - We 're rich . - I 'll put that on your death stone . - My death stone ? - We can 't raise the Galactica . She must have altered course . Son , we thought we 'd never ... You ! I want to talk to you ! - You ... - That can wait . Our sensors picked up Cylon fighters . Death to the Cylons ! Robber , get those people to cover . Back in the block . Let 's move ! Back in the block , come on . - You 'll have to fly the recon viper . - She doesn 't have lasers . But she 's fast . Starbuck , get the Cylons ' attention . We 'll surprise them . - Wake up , CORA . - ' Starbuck ! ' Save the welcome for later . We got three Cylons on our tail . 'Computing . Estimate they will fire in . 85 microns . ' Engage booster one micron before . 'Anything you say , honey . 'Hang on . ' He 's got them occupied . Let 's go . 'Here they come again . ' - They 're splitting up . - I 'll take the left . - ' Here they come . ' - Execute a maximum G climb . - ' You 'll black out . You 're only human . ' - You 're not . - ' I 'm beginning to regret that . ' - So am I. Ready ... Now ! 'Starbuck ? Starbuck ? ' 'Starbuck ? Starbuck ? - ' Honey ? ' - CORA . We did it . - We did it ! - ' Of course we did it . 'The Cylon couldn 't match my pull-up . 'It crashed into the structures 2.7 metrons east of the castle . 'I 'm scanning a regular inferno down there . 'These structures contained highly volatile fluids . ' Oh , frack ! There goes my fortune . Commander , long-range scan indicates ships approaching . It 's quadrant Omega Alpha 6 . Lead ship identification coming through . - It 's Recon Viper 1 . - Are you certain ? Positive . We 're receiving the marker beacon . He 's leading two vipers and a shuttle craft . It 's Starbuck and Apollo 's patrol . Well , Colonel , inform Boxey his father 's coming home . With pleasure , sir . We have our warriors back and we welcome a good many voyagers who are complaining rather vociferously about the quality of our Ambrosa . And Boxey has something for his father . He worked very hard on that . What a beautiful map . - Look at this . - Yes , he really did a good job here . Will you be an astro-navigator ? No , a viper pilot like my father . That 's really very good . But this blue planet is out of orbit . It belongs here . How do you know that ? I don 't know . I guess I saw it somewhere or ... No , I got it . That cell I was in was covered with pictures and charts . This system was one of them . The Silent One . It 's a prisoner my father told me about . Enforcers found him drifting in space . He never said a word , just spent his time drawing those pictures . Why ? Is it important ? Well , the solar system that I taught Boxey to draw ... was something that I 'd remembered from our ancient legends . It was the solar system that contained the planet Earth . 'Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny , 'the last battlestar , Galactica , 'leads a ragtag fugitive fleet 'on a lonely quest - 'a shining planet 'known as Earth . '

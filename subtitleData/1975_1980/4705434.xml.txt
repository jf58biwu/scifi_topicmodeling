 This is it . The Forbidden Zone . - Let 's get back . - No hurry . Let 's get back and report . We 've got nothing to report . If we get back and tell Kasabi what 's INSIDE the zone ... She said as far as the security boundary . - You see any boundary ? . - I can see a notice . You shouldn 't believe everything you read . Intruders in coordinate seventeen . Good . Kasabi 's men , they must be . My intelligence reports were correct . Do you doubt me now , Supreme Commander ? . They are Outsiders . There is nothing to indicate they are Kasabi 's men . They are . Scouting ahead of the main party . I 'm not convinced . But assuming you 're right , what do you intend doing about them ? . - Nothing . - Nothing . - We wait . - I have waited for eighteen days . It won 't be much longer now . It 's started , I can feel it ... - Oh , T ravis ! - ... I know Blake is coming here . - And them ? . - Unimportant . They 're already dead . Doesn 't look like much . We 've gone far enough , Arle . Kasabi said that this was the most heavily protected site anywhere in the Federation . Well , she was wrong , wasn 't she ? . That must be where Control was housed . Only the entrance to it . The main computer was in an underground vault . - Let 's see if we can get inside . - Oh , I dunno . Oh , come on , Berg . You 're not old enough to have lost your nerve yet . Help me . Help me . I can 't move . I can 't . I can 't ! How long before we reach our destination ? . We 'll be in teleport range in three hours and four minutes . - Teleport ? . - Take her on manual , Jenna . - Switched to manual . - Teleport range , Blake ? . - In three hours we 'll be in teleport range of Earth . - Earth ? . Blake , are you crazy ? . We can 't afford to take risks like that . We were just going to skirt the system , that 's what you said , take a quick look at the defences . - The perimeter defences . - Yes , and that was dangerous enough . You never said anything about looking at the perimeter from the inside . We must take this risk . All right , I didn 't expect you to welcome the idea . That 's why I misled you just a little . - That 's very diplomatically put . - Is my phraseology your only complaint , Avon ? . - No , but it is my only surprise . - You knew ? . I never really believed the long-range reconnaissance story . Earth has been on your mind for a long time , Blake . Too long for you to sit outside the planetary system and look . It 's time we really hurt the Federation . Oh , we 've been hitting at the fingers , the arms . I want to hit at the heart . And the heart of the Federation is Earth . Where exactly , or do you plan to take the whole planet ? . Two hundred years ago , when the Federation began expansion and conquest , the Administration established a computer complex to monitor information : political , civil , military ... everything . That computer is the nerve centre of ALL Federation activity . Smashing that would be the biggest single step toward the destruction of their power . I don 't think they would ever recover from it . You 're suggesting that we go into the Forbidden Zone and attack Control ? . - Yes , that is what I am suggesting . - Do we know where this computer complex is ? . - Most Earth people have heard of it . - But do we know where it is ? . The Federation never made any secret of its whereabouts . On the contrary , they advertise the fact . Control has become a symbol of Federation power . It 's a challenge . All the might and the power of the Federation is represented by Control . While it exists , the Federation is invulnerable . There have been many attempts to destroy it . They 've all failed . That 's true , isn 't it , Blake ? . Yes , there 've been massive rocket attacks from space , ground assaults , every kind of attack . Control still operates untouched . Armies can 't do it , space fleets can 't do it , but we can , is that it ? . For the past year now , I 've been collecting all the information I could find . With Orac 's help , I now know more about Control than anyone outside the senior echelon of the Federation . I think I can destroy it . I 'm not going to minimise the danger . It 's a high-risk operation . That is why I 'm not going to ask any of you to come with me . - You think you could do it without us ? . - I 'd rather not try . But if I have to , I will not be alone . I 've already contacted a Resistance leader . - No sign of them ? . - They should have reported back hours ago . I specifically told them to avoid any contact with the security forces . - Are you going to wait ? . - No . Blake will be looking for our signal . I must get to the rendezvous point . Getting close to the Forbidden Zone . Stay quiet and be alert . Kasabi . At last . Worth an eighteen-day wait , Supreme Commander ? . Oh , T ravis . I 've waited longer than that . That woman was a senior political officer in Space Command . I am aware of her background . She taught officer cadets . But what she was teaching was treason . Until a very bright young cadet reported her . Yes , Travis , I was . A very bright cadet . You ? . You reported her ? . There was an official inquiry , during which the stupid fools let her escape . - I 'll make sure that doesn 't happen this time . - You 'll stay here , T ravis . - But ... - Kasabi is mine . Blake , we 've decided to come with you . Thank you . I could do with all the help I can get . - There is a condition . - Yes ? . None of us is prepared to commit suicide . We don 't intend to die making some heroic gesture . We need a chance of survival . We want your word that if the mission looks impossible , then we 'll pull out . Yes . Guarantee that , and we 're all with you . It 's understood the decision is mine and mine alone ? . - Yes , that is understood . - Yes . All right , if it looks as if we have less than an even chance , I promise I 'll call the whole thing off . - Good . - You two get kitted up . You two stand by . The others have decided to go with me . I thought they would . Not very bright , but loyal . - That leaves you . - I have thought about it And ? . Come on Avon , stop playing games . Are you going to go with me or not ? . Well , of course . I am surprised you ever doubted it . Thank you . Frankly , I don 't see how you can do it without me . Your strongest enemies are the defence computers . I am the only one qualified to tackle them . Yes , that had occurred to me . You better start getting kitted up . Do you want to tell me why ? . - I like the challenge . - You don 't want to tell me why . If we succeed , if we destroy Control , the Federation will be at its weakest . It will be more vulnerable than it has been for centuries . The revolt in the Outer Worlds will grow . The resistance movements on Earth will launch an all-out attack to destroy the Federation . They will need unifying . They will need a leader . YOU will be the natural choice . - Possibly . - Don 't be modest , Blake . You are the only one that they would all follow . You would have no choice . You would have to stay on Earth and organise the revolt . - If there 's no other way . - There wouldn 't be . That still doesn 't explain why you 're backing me . With you running the campaign on Earth , somebody has to take charge of all this . - You want the Liberator ? . - Exactly . If we succeed , the destruction of Control gives us both what we want . Could be you 're planning just a little far ahead . Perhaps . But sooner or later , I will have my chance . There 's no hurry . Flight completed . We are in stationary orbit within teleport range of the planet Earth . Put it on the screen , Zen . It 's been a long time . Kasabi . Stay where you are . Stand still , all of you . - Throw down your weapons . - Run ! Now . Enough . Get the child . Kasabi . - You should have left it to me . - Nothing 's lost . - Your opening fire could have ruined everything . - But it didn 't , T ravis . - My last chance , you said . - Kasabi and I had unfinished business . This is no time for personal vendettas , Supreme Commander . Thank you , T ravis . I 'm obliged for the reminder . Are you feeling better ? . Oh , don 't waste time , Kasabi . You have so little of it left . Time spent with you was always wasted , Servalan . - It 's good to see you again . - Why did you murder my people ? . Well , they were traitors . Did they expect mercy ? . - From you ? . - Blake . - Who ? . - You were to rendezvous with him . Is he young ? . More in your line , surely . If you tell me about the rendezvous , I will consider sparing your life . - My life isn 't yours to spare . - Oh , but it is . Then take it . But don 't try and browbeat me , Servalan . Or have you forgotten that I knew you as a cadet ? . You were a credit to your background : ... spoilt , idle , vicious . My confidential assessment listed her unfit for command . But I forgot how well connected she was . That is no concern of mine . Then it should be . It should be everyone 's concern . The Federation is degenerate , run by creatures like her . - You are going to tell me about Blake . - You think so ? . - Oh , yes , we think so . - You could spare yourself a lot of pain . - No doubt . - You are a very intelligent woman . - Don 't tell me you 're squeamish , Space Commander ? . - Not in the least . Your reputation suggests that you enjoy your work . And your reputation suggests you 're playing for time . Secure her to the chair . Your backup force doesn 't seem too dependable , Blake . - The signal is over an hour late . - Why don 't we forget the whole thing ? . No . We 've waited a long time to come back to Earth . Be a pity to miss the chance now . Blake , couldn 't a couple of us teleport down , find out what 's happened ? . - We will wait for the signal . - And if it doesn 't come ? . We 'll pull out . Give it another hour . Come on , come on . Where were you to rendezvous with Blake ? . You can rot , T ravis . I 'll tell you nothing , nothing . She 's stronger than she looks . She 's still resisting the drug . - Double the dose . - That amount could kill her . That 's not important , just so long as she talks first . Kasabi . Can you hear me , Kasabi ? . - I hear you . - Tell me about the rendezvous . No rendezvous . Very soon now , you are going to die . Do you understand me ? . Always understood you . You 're vicious , greedy , sick . Is there nothing here that might give us a lead ? . No , I 've checked them . This is the only important thing . A homing beacon ? . I 'm presuming it was to give Blake a signal to give him a landing fix . That 's all we need . No , the signal may have to be sent in code . If we don 't get it right , we could scare Blake off . And the beacon may have to transmit from an agreed location . If its position does not match Blake 's coordinates , he won 't come in . Now , that should be long enough . Where were you to rendezvous with Blake ? . Coordinates three three one , eleven zero one . That 's better . Now , Kasabi , listen to this : was the homing beacon to transmit in a code pattern ? . Yes . It was pulse ; three long , two short , recurring . Now it 's over , Kasabi . Servalan . I 'm sorry . Sorry ? . I should have tried . In the beginning , I should have tried to help you . Time 's up . We 're pulling out . Jenna , I want the shortest way out of this system . Avon , run a proximity check on battle fleet patrols . Shall I get back to the flight deck , then ? . You might as well . [ BEACON SIGNAL ] Wait ! That 's it , that 's the signal . Three long , two short , three long , two short . Cally , get a fix on it . Three three one , eleven zero one . That confirms it . Standby to put me down . You want to teleport to these coordinates ? . Yes . No . Put me down at zero point five varying . That should be about a mile away from the rendezvous . - Why ? . - I 'll scout around before I make contact . What 's the matter , Blake ? . Don 't you trust your friends ? . Of course . I trust them the same way I trust you . Teleport 's set . Right . You all know what to do . Gan , are you all set ? . - Yes . I 'll be waiting . - All right . Put me down . Down and safe . As far as I can see , it 's all clear . Get an exact locator fix on my signal and send Gan down . Teleport locked on . He 's on his way . Gan 's down and safe . Now , you 're quite clear about the rest of the plan ? . Quite clear . We all know what to do . All right , start the second countdown now . - Countdown running . - Good luck , Blake . What is this place ? . - A church . - A church ? . - Place of religious assembly . - Must be ancient . The Federation had them all destroyed at the beginning of the New Calendar . - There 's no sign of Kasabi ? . - No . Somebody 's been here , though . And not long ago . Liberator , we 're going in now . Looks quiet , but if I give the word , teleport us out . Fast . No ! No . No ... She 's still alive . Who do you think she is ? . One of Kasabi 's people . She 's lost a lot of blood by the look of it . Let 's have a look . No , she 'll be fine , soon as I treat her with this . [ MEDIC SCAN ] I 'd better tell the others . Come in , Blake . Liberator , we 're at the rendezvous point . Everything 's all right . You have made contact with Kasabi ? . - Not yet . Not directly . - Then everything is not all right . It will be . I 'll get back to you . Do you get the feeling there 's something he 's not telling us ? . I don 't know . I hate waiting like this . Could be worse . We could be down there with him . I 'd prefer that to being here . You 're welcome to take my place when the time comes . If it comes . - What do you mean ? . - Something 's not right . He 's failed to make contact with Kasabi . Exactly . But Kasabi 's signal came from the rendezvous point . Blake has arrived there and failed to make contact . That doesn 't necessarily mean anything disastrous . Perhaps they 're just being extra careful . Let 's hope so . I have a feeling that we are not being careful enough . No ! It 's all right , it 's all right . We won 't hurt you . Take this . - No . - Please . - Who are you ? . - My name is Gan . This is Blake . Blake ! You came , then . Yes . What is your name ? . Veron . I 'm Kasabi 's daughter . - Where is your mother ? . - She 's dead . What happened ? . We were ambushed , we didn 't have a chance . My mother was hit , everyone else was killed . I started to run but they came after me , so I hid . That 's all right now . Sssh . Gently , gently . What happened then ? . They searched the area . One of them came right up to where I was hiding . I was so frightened . They searched for a long time ... and then I stayed hidden for a while , and then I came here as we planned . I gave the signal . Well , you 're safe now . We 'll take care of you . I 'm very sorry about your mother . She was a remarkable woman . You lie here and rest while we decide what 's to be done . Thank you . Blake , we 're going to have to pull out . It 's a setback , but we 've come this far . It means a change of plan , but I 'd still like to try for it . What 's the use ? . The risks are doubled now . I 'm not so sure . Kasabi was only giving us backup cover , holding off the security forces to give us time to penetrate the Forbidden Zone . Yes , so how can we hope to do it without her ? . We still have the element of surprise . Even more so now with Kasabi 's force wiped out . Security aren 't going to expect another assault so soon . You 're guessing , Blake . Guessing and hoping . It is a calculated risk . Remember , we 've got one foolproof factor : the teleport . Even if they do attack , we can still get out . We will have failed , but at least we 'll be alive . - It 's still a big risk . - It always was . Even with Kasabi 's people , there were no guarantees . All right , what do we do now ? . We carry on as planned . The next step is still up to Avon and Vila . Liberator , do you read me ? . We hear you . We 're going ahead with phase two . Avon and Vila ready ? . What about Kasabi ? . Avon , give me a rundown check on what you 're going to do . We teleport directly into the Forbidden Zone , we make an analysis of the defence systems , and then we teleport directly to your location . No more than five minutes in the zone . Get out sooner if you sense something 's wrong . I 've already got that feeling , Blake . What about Kasabi ? . Cally , if you don 't get their signal , transfer them after five minutes anyway . - Confirmed . - That is all then . Good luck . - You ready ? . - He didn 't answer your question . - He will . - I don ' t want to go . - You surprise me . - I don 't feel well . I 'm going to be a big handicap . I 'm used to that . - Avon . Good luck . - Put us down , Cally . THAT will be the only access point . We have to get into there before we can try for the main vault . But before that , we have to cross the zone . I 've the feeling we 're being watched . Automatic scanners will have picked us up as soon as we got here . - What 's that ? . - High intensity radiation grid . The rays from these could burn you up in seconds . In that case , do you think you ought to be fooling around with it ? . It has to be activated somehow . Let 's find out . Walk anywhere here , and you set the whole thing into operation . Total self-repair in eight seconds . How far would you say it is to that blockhouse ? . Fifty yards , maybe more . Are you sure we 're safe here ? . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Time 's up . Teleport now . Don ' t worry , they 're friends . - How did they get here ? . - We have teleport equipment . - I don 't know what that is . - You know , I 'm not sure I do . - Well ? . - It is not going to be easy . - Can we do it ? . - Not a chance , it 's absolutely impossible . There is a way . Where are Kasabi and her people ? . They were wiped out in an ambush . This is Kasabi 's daughter . Veron , Avon , Vila . Veron was the only survivor . I 'm sorry . I knew you were lying . Yes , well unless you can come up with some good reasons why not , we 're going ahead as planned . Certain death , would you accept that as a good reason ? . From somebody else , maybe . All right , but if we all get killed , don 't say I didn 't warn you . Let 's hear the rest of it . One thing is in our favour , there do not seem to be any security forces within the zone . - None at all ? . - They don 't need them . The defence system is totally automated . It is more efficient than any brigade of troops . That improves our chances . This is the idea : we start here near the perimeter . Then we teleport across the Forbidden Zone directly into the entry blockhouse . You know , the teleport will have to be precise . A fraction out and we 'll land up right in the middle of the zone . - Cally and Jenna won 't make any mistakes . - You all right , Veron ? . Do you mind if I go up for some air ? . I still feel a bit faint . Well , don 't go too far . You mustn 't take any chances . I won 't . Now , once we 're into the entry blockhouse ... Why don 't we teleport right down to the control computer chamber ? . Too deep . Teleport won 't necessarily reliably transmit through that level of density . Anyway , we need an exact locator fix . The only way to get that is to ... - ... is to go there first . - Right . I wouldn 't be too certain that it can even get us into the blockhouse . Judging by the electronics we 've seen , there 's bound to be anti-matter screening built into the structure . All right , then we teleport right up to the door of the entry blockhouse . Then it 's up to Vila to break the locking systems . Can you do it , Vila ? . That 's a stupid question . At least I think it is . Right . Let 's discuss what we do once we get inside . - According to intelligence reports , there is a shaft ... - Down ! - Are you beginning to have doubts , T ravis ? . - No . It won 't fail . I hope not . There 'll be no second chances . I won 't need them . It 's running my way now . The luck has changed . It 's my turn . Capturing the girl was the only luck you 've had so far . That single event has given me total control of the situation . You 've gambled everything on her cooperation . That was no gamble . She will do precisely as she was instructed . She has no choice . Get rid of that . - Sono gas . - Yes , but who threw it in ? . Veron . It had to be . No , I don 't believe that . Why should she do it ? . By all means , let us stand around and discuss it . Avon 's right . We 're not safe here any longer . Let 's move out . The door 's been blocked off . It won 't budge . - It 's barred . - Let me try . - It won 't move . - Leave it . I 'll tell Cally . We 've no means of getting hold of the Liberator , no means of getting out of here . - Someone set up a trap . - And it worked , didn 't it ? . With no teleport to snatch them away , they 're mine . They believed your story . It wasn 't difficult . It was close to the truth . The only lies were that I escaped the ambush , and that my mother was dead . - You did seal the entrance ? . - Yes , just as you told me . Good . You did well . You can be proud of yourself . I disgust myself . That will pass . There is a reward for Blake , you know . - What you made me do ... - Might even get you a civilian citation . - No ! - You were sensible . You did what was expedient . I betrayed four men , men who represent the only cause worth fighting for . That 's what I did . And now I want my side of the bargain . Bargain ? . Travis , did you make a bargain with this traitor ? . My mother ! Let me take her ! He promised me my mother would go ... Don 't concern yourself with your mother . She died one hour ago . NO ! I want my mother . Now you 'll stay here as my prisoner . I 'll deal with her . You just bring me Blake . As the Supreme Commander orders . Kasabi 's child . - It 's no good . - Let me try again . It 's opening ! Sorry it took so long . I 'm a bit out of condition . Come in , Blake . This is Liberator . Come in . Avon , Vila , Gan , respond . Are you reading us ? . Come in . It 's over an hour since our last contact . - It can 't be a communicator fault . - Not on all four bracelets , no . - What do you think has happened ? . - They 've run into trouble . Yes . And what do we do , wait and guess ? . What was our last contact bearing ? . Here . They have not had time to get far . Couple of miles at the most , and without their teleport they 're earthbound now . - I will call security . - No ! But they would have men searching the woods for them now . - I want to take him myself . - Shall I call Central ? . There 's still a way . We have to think like Blake . Think how he would act in a situation like this . Now , where is the most dangerous place he could go ? . The last place we would think of searching for him ? . The Forbidden Zone , he 'd go into the Forbidden Zone . That 's what he came for , and that 's where he 'll go . Come on ! These are weight and disturbance sensitive . Touch them and you activate the ray emission . They have already registered our presence , so the whole area will be sensitised and primed . Cut the mesh , and it has an eight second repair cycle . - Sounds unbeatable . - It may well be . But come on , you 've got something on your mind . If I can fire at ground level , the beam radiation should be great enough to cut a narrow channel through the sensor mesh . That would give you eight seconds to get from here to the blockhouse . The mesh would start its repair cycle instantly . Take one step off the channel and you 're dead . I know it 's a slim chance , but it 's the best I can come up with . Let 's try it . - How 's your sprinting ? . - I think I 'm about to find out . Make it quick . There is no room for a good loser in this race . You go the minute I give you the word , understand ? . Right . [ GUNFIRE ] GO ! Faster , Blake ! You next , Vila . You can get started on the door . I 'm about to set a new galactic record . [ GUNFIRE ] Now ! Gan ! Come on , come on . You took a big risk there , Gan . I thought it might save time . Besides , I needed a pacemaker . - Me too . Implanted in my heart . - Just get started on the door . [ GUNFIRE ] Avon ! - It will repair before he gets here . - You 'll hit him ! Let go ! [ GUNFIRE ] Avon , run for your life ! Come on , come on . THANK YOU . - How long ? . - Oh , it 's a difficult one . Thirty seconds ? . Get started . Supreme Commander , I don 't know how he did it , but Blake has penetrated the Control complex . I want to go in after him . I 'll need the Zone deactivated . I don ' t have the authority to order that . Then get the authority . I 'm so close now . The only way out is the way Blake went in . I can shut him off . I want that authority . Stand by . Central ? This is Supreme Commander Servalan . I want a direct link to the High Council , priority rating one . Hold . - Hold it . - What is it ? . More security . Sprinting 's one thing , but I think flying 's beyond me . Am I safe now ? . No . What about now ? . Possibly . Come on , Vila , there 's another lock here . Times like this , I wish I 'd gone straight . - T ravis ? . - Yes , Supreme Commander ? I 've staked a great deal on this , T ravis , but I 've achieved what you wanted . The zone will be deactivated in precisely fifteen seconds . That 's all I 'll need . Both our heads are on the block now , T ravis . This must not fail . Don 't worry , Supreme Commander , I will not fail you . Who are you ? . Gan ! This is it ! - Oh , it 's a bad one . - Can you do it ? . - I 'm not sure . - You 've got to ! Behind this door is the key to it all : Control . That computer is the most vital part of Federation power . We 're the thickness of this door away from destroying them . That should do it . - Come on , open , open . - Come on . I 'll have to try another way . It means starting all over again . Take all the time you want . You CAN do it . - Gan , try pushing it , this time . - Right . We 've done it , we 've done it . I 've done it ! Blake ! There 's nothing here . There 's nothing here . Nothing . Ha Ha Ha ! T ravis . You believed it , Blake , like all the other fools before you . Destroy Control and you destroy the Federation . No . It WAS here . Everybody knows it was here . Of course . We 've never concealed it . On the contrary , we 've broadcast the fact . We used it as a challenge to our enemies ; we invited them to attack Control . It was never here ? . It was moved , thirty years ago . To where ? . Even I don 't know that . But it 's safe and secure and will remain so while those who seek to destroy us believe it 's here . You see , it 's the great illusion , Blake . You give substance and credibility to an empty room , and the real thing becomes undetectable , virtually invisible . Now take their weapons . I 've waited a long time for this moment , Blake , and it was worth it . Move out . Release your prisoners , T ravis . No ! Your mutoids will put down their weapons . - What are you talking about ? . - Do as I order ! What 's the matter with you , Servalan ? . - She 's nervous . - Jenna ! When we lost contact , I came looking for you . I happened to come across this one . I thought she might come in useful . I also found somebody else . She told me what had happened . Travis threatened to kill her mother unless she betrayed you . Then he killed her anyway . The moment you pull that trigger they will be dead . - That 's right , but so would your Supreme Commander . - And so would you . Release them . Do it ! Your move , I think , T ravis . Take their weapons . All right , let 's move . It seems as though we both failed , T ravis . Get after them ! You hesitated . My life was at risk and you hesitated . - Jenna , have you got the teleport bracelets ? . - Yes . Too risky to use them here . Let 's get nearer the surface . Right . T ravis , what 's that ? . Strontium grenade . You fool , it 's too powerful ! You 'll bring the roof in ! The door ! Now , come on , Gan , hurry , come on , come on . Blake ! My leg ! Blake ! Go ! I 'm not worth dying for ! Gan ! Gan . No . They must be trapped . Come on , let 's go back . Blake ? . - Where 's Gan ? . - Gan 's dead . It 's completely blocked . There 's no way through . Brilliant ! They 'll dig us out eventually . Oh , yes . They 'll dig us out eventually . And then I 'll bury you . You 're welcome to come with us . - I have a debt to pay . - So have we . Mine must be paid here on Earth . Bring us up , Cally . State course and speed . Standard by Ten . Get us out of the Solar system . - The instruction is imprecise . - Just do it . Confirmed .

I don ´ t know , school and sports , all that stu ... I just won ´ t fit in there . I feel like a freak . - What is this ? - Maybe if I knew what was wrong with me ... There ´ s nothing wrong with you . - I might do OK in a zoo . - What the hell are you doing ? feeling sorry for yourself ? OK , you have a talent that would shock the hell out of people . But it ´ s a talent that also can be put to good use . It ´ s nothin ´ to be ashamed of . ChiIdress understands this . That ´ s why he wants you to go to this school in Chicago . You ´ II meet other kids that are special , Iike you . Robin ... I ´ II be with you . AII the way . If it doesn ´ t work out , we ´ II do something else . Robin ... do me a favour . I wanna talk to your father alone . One minute . - Sure . I ´ II be on the terrace , Dad . - OK . Peter , you ´ ve gotta give me the telephone number of that dame from the antique shop . There ´ s nothing antique about her . Everything works . - Gonna miss you . - well , I ´ m not gonna miss you . 20 years together in the same agency is more than enough . well , you taught me a Iot . You did . If this is a teary farewell , get outta here . No tears . AII laughs . Say goodbye to your son alone . Waiter . regular luncheon for two . My dad ! Get Robin outta here ! - Dad ! - Your father ´ s all right . He ´ s a professional . - They ´ re after my dad ! - They ´ re after all of us . For Christ ´ s sakes ... Dad ! They killed my dad ! Oh , son , I ´ m sorry . They killed my dad ! Robertson , where the hell are ya ? Gimme the gun ! I ´ II find out who broke security . - I ´ II ... - No ! Get this boy outta here . - Come on , Robin , move . Into the car . - It ´ II be all right , Robin . - I ´ m sorry , sir . - It ´ s all right , Jonathan . Good job . - I ´ m proud of you . Go by the road . - Thank you . Sure . Give me the film . It ´ s already 87 degrees this morning ... I said " Mother , what do you want from me ? " " You got this terrific job . You ´ re all over the world . " I get to see her once a month , if I ´ m lucky . " I ´ m happy for you . I really am . " But I said " Just don ´ t try and run my Iife when you happen to be around the house for a few days and feel like playing Mom . " I know . They just don ´ t know how to let go . And they get so hurt when you try to explain . really . Anyway , Iet ´ s see if you know this junk . January 10th , 1946 . That was the first United Nations general assembly - that was held in London . Right ? - Good . - See , I told you . I never forget dates . - AII right ... Who was elected president of the assembly ? It ´ s names I have trouble with . - LaRue , don ´ t tell me . - I didn ´ t say anything . - Yes , you did . You said " Raymond " . - I did not . " Raymond " ? His name wasn ´ t Raymond . It was ... Raymond Dunwoodie . Who was Raymond Dunwoodie ? I don ´ t know . It ´ s just ... that name just came into my head . I don ´ t know . - So what was the real answer ? - PauI-Henri Spaak of belgium . Oh , yes ! - PauI-Henri Spaak . I always get that wrong . - OK , next . The five permanent members of the UN Security council are ... The United States , Russia ... I know . Let ´ s just forget the whole thing . - Forget it ? Are you crazy ? - LaRue , I know this stu . - We have a final at two o ´ clock . - And I ´ m gonna pass with flying colours . Hey , guess what . We got a buddy . Oh , my God . What a creep . He ´ s walking backwards now . - should we give him money ? - No ! God , what do you take me for ? I don ´ t know . Oh , he ´ s not gonna bother us . - I hope we pass . - Sure ! Two popcorns , please . - hello ? - Mr Johnson ? - Yes . - It ´ s Raymond Dunwoodie . - What is it , Raymond ? - Now , look , I haven ´ t changed my mind . There ´ s nothing I can do for you personally , but I may have somebody to locate your son . You ´ d better not be wasting my time . No , look , I ´ m at the beach , and I made a contact . She ´ s a kid , maybe 17 , and she ´ s psychic . - Are you sure ? - That ´ s right , she ´ s psychic . Bring her here . I don ´ t have her yet , but I couId get her . Now , look ... Mr Johnson , this is gonna cost . How much ? I don ´ t mean 50 or 100 bucks , not for this girl . - How much , Raymond ? - $ 1,000 . I don ´ t have that kind of money . That ´ s a sad story , Mr J. almost as sad as the story you told me about your boy . Dunwoodie paid o . We ´ ve completed the trace . He ´ s talking to Sandza at the plymouth hotel . - Step inside , o the street . - Yes , sir . - Is this man registered here ? - I don ´ t know . - I just came on a haIf-hour ago myself . - We think he ´ s been here a few days . You ain ´ t the police , is ya ? well ... I ´ m what you ´ d consider weII-traveIIed , but I ´ ve never heard of you gentlemen . We don ´ t spend a dime on public relations . Yeah , well ... That would be Mr RV Johnson . Room 512 . Just down the hall to your left . Hey , government man . Don ´ t bust my door down , please . Use a passkey . Chase One to Chase Two . He ´ s loose . Do you copy ? He ´ s loose . Do you copy ? Chase One to Chase Two . He ´ s loose . Do you copy ? Gunmen of the Hanafi muslim sect continue their siege of three Washington buildings ... Goddammit ! Did you hear that , Vivian ? Now that ´ s what I ´ m talkin ´ about . Them bozos in Washington are mugging ´ the whole damn country . Every court in the land is makin ´ it legal . If you asked me what happened to the milk of human kindness , I ´ d have to tell you frankly that the whole world has dried up at the tit . You can say that again . I swear to hell I don ´ t know ... - Vivian ! - Yes , Mother NuckeIIs , I ´ m coming . CouIdn ´ t you just once manage to go potty by yourself ? - Vivian , somebody ´ s in my room ! - Oh , sure . AII right , now . Nobody ´ s gonna get hurt . - I just want some clothes . - He came in my window . Do you know who he is ? I told you we should have moved to melrose Park . This wouldn ´ t be happening if we lived in melrose Park . You want clothes ? old clothes , anything you ´ ve got . well , you can see I need clothes . I can ´ t go anywhere like this . - Just the clothes ? - Yes . I had to leave the hotel in a hurry , so could you spare a couple of dollars ? could do . This is a graphic example of biofeedback . We ´ re converting the very Iow-voItage aIpha-wave energy into electricity to run that train . And that train will only run when my friend Hester is in alpha . Now , as you may have hoped , there are more practical applications to biofeedback training . If you can regulate your brain waves , you can control your heart rate , blood pressure , headaches , backaches , even , ladies , cold feet . I work at the Paragon Institute , where we study the phenomena of extrasensory perception . And we are using biofeedback techniques to tap the almost limitless resources of the human mind . And I am speaking now of such things as thought transmissions , commonly known as telepathy . Now , that machine is called a magnetometer , and it records the fluctuations of the human electromagnetic field during our experiments , and I guess Hester ´ s had it . Thank you , Hester . I wanna stress that no particular talent is needed to achieve this . Anybody can achieve alpha ... with a little patience . Wanna try ? Sure . Try to remember that " alpha " is another word for " passive " . Right . VisuaIise sitting in an empty theatre in front of a blank screen . And let that screen fill your mind . OK . - What is she doing ? - I have no idea . Don ´ t mind about them . It ´ s OK . Are you all right ? Creep . I ´ d say I ´ m pretty sound , considering the ravages of time . For instance , I don ´ t have the use of any more than one of my limbs or vital organs . Good thing the Lord God Jehovah built in so many spare parts . - But when the old ticker gives out , that ´ s it . - Ain ´ t that the truth ? - How long do you think you ´ II be staying ? - Shut up , Vivian . - Let the boy enjoy his breakfast . - Thank you . - What is it they want you for ? - I ´ m a high-IeveI security risk . Did you get it yet ? - No . - It ´ s been over two months . would you shut up , Betsy ? It does not ! I mean ... - GiIIian , I was saving that seat for cheryl . - Too bad . - cheryl can sit over here . - Oh , God . cheryl , I ´ m sorry . I tried to save a seat for you , but GiIIian just took it . - Look , have my seat ... - Hey , watch it . Good Lord , Pam . If you ´ re that nervous , why don ´ t you masturbate ? Are you ready for tomorrow ? You two are so sweet . When are you getting married ? See any ghosts today , gillian ? - cheryl , you ´ re not very funny . - GiIIian ´ s not very funny . There are more mature ways to get attention , don ´ t you think , gillian ? - Have you seen Mr Wadkins ´ new girlfriend ? - Yeah , where ´ d he pick that ticket ? Read my mind . - What ? - tell me what I ´ m thinking . Come on , right now . Read my mind . That ´ s what they say you can do . No , I don ´ t know how to read minds , cheryl . It ´ s ridiculous . - cheryl , just ... - Shut up , LaRue . I only wanna find something out . That ´ s all . AII right , come on . Oh , great . Now pay attention , everybody . gillian ´ s gonna perform . I didn ´ t say I ´ d ... cheryl , I don ´ t know anything about reading minds , all right ? I mean , I don ´ t even know what I ´ m thinkin ´ most of the time , so ... get o my back . - GiIIian , you ´ re so full of shit . - cheryl , you ´ re an asshole . Just shut up . She can ´ t help being upset . She has to take it out on someone . What did you say ? You don ´ t want everyone to know that you ´ re pregnant ? What ? I would Iike for you to explain that little remark . - Just what do you think you know about me ? - I ´ m sorry , I didn ´ t ... - tell me ! - Let go , cheryl . Let go . - tell me ! - please let go . - cheryl ! - tell me ! No ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! help me ! I put some cookies in a bag for you . - You might get hungry later on . - Thank you . How ´ s your hair ? Dry yet ? Oh , it ´ s fine . - Hey ! - Oh , just fine . That ShinoIa will wash right out . I ´ d appreciate it if you ´ d wait till after M * A * S * H to let them go . M * A * S * H ? I ´ II wait till Sunrise Semester . Might as well just leave ´ em there . They ain ´ t got anything to say I wanna hear . I ´ ve heard it all before . Peter ? That ´ s your real name ? That ´ s right . Can ´ t see a reason why you ´ d make up lies to tell me . - I don ´ t matter , anyhow . - I wouldn ´ t lie to you , Mother NuckeIIs . You know that . Then I hope you find your son . If he ´ s alive ... I ´ II find him . And if the Feds get in your way , shoot ´ em . Just shoot ´ em . It ´ s all they deserve . There ´ s so many of them . They just keep coming . kill ´ em ! kill ´ em ! Now don ´ t overwork yourself , Mother NuckeIIs . It ´ s bad for the old ticker . Thank you . would you let us outta here now ? No ? - please ! - Get us outta here , do you hear ? Let ´ s go check that out . - That ´ s all the way down . - OK , man , I dig . - Hey , man . Check out Pops . - Let ´ s see what the old man got in the bag . Watch One to Top Guy One . visual and clear . Do you copy ? - OK , Iet ´ s have the bag . - He ´ s got a gun . Come on , I wanna go home . - Home with you ? - With me , yeah . I ´ II never go home with you . Come on . - I don ´ t wanna go home . - You ´ re gonna go home right now . Hey , how ´ s that for a horn ? But listen to that stereo . You ever heard better fuckin ´ stereo sound in your life ? How can you be sure it ´ s Sandza ? He had to be in the neighbourhood . AII we had to do was wait . I trained with him . I know his style . What ´ s he doing now ? Over . Looks like off-duty cops in that cadillac ahead of us . There ´ s nothing he can do . - Can I help you , Pop ? - You ´ re under arrest . What ? You ´ re under arrest for impersonating police oicers . Hey , hey , look out ! What the hell ... ? He ´ s got a piece . It ´ s in my armpit . AII right ... what do you want me to do ? Drive down that alley . Fast . Crazy son of a bitch ! Take a right ! Faster ! holy shit ! - should I drive a little faster ? - No . slower . slower ? Right now you ´ re the only two people in the world I feel safe with . - I wanna enjoy your company . - Yeah , OK , sure , sure . Why not ? We ´ II just cruise around a little bit . Maybe after a while you ´ II wanna talk . Yeah . What ´ s your name ? - Peter . - I ´ m Marty O ´ Brien ... - Is that gun uncomfortable in your armpit ? - No , no . I want you to meet my partner , Oicer EggIeston . Hi , Peter . Why don ´ t you call me Bob ? Hi , Bob . Nice car . Yeah , it ´ s brand-new . I just picked it up about a haIf-hour ago . - I wouldn ´ t want anything to happen to it . - I don ´ t blame you . - Is that shoe polish in your hair , Peter ? - Yes , it is . It ´ s a disguise . - That ´ s a pretty clever disguise . - Yeah . It didn ´ t work , though . They were waiting for me . Must have been waiting all day . I gotta give that ChiIdress a Iot of credit , the son of a bitch . Somebody ´ s after you , is that it ? What do you suppose he ´ s tellin ´ those cops ? Whatever it is , they won ´ t believe him . I worked for a government agency you never heard of . They took my son away from me . They needed him , so they just took him . Keep your hand in your lap , Marty . It ´ s a frightening power these people have . They can make anybody disappear any time . - Somebody ´ s gotta stop ´ em . - Yeah , that ´ s right . If you don ´ t mind , maybe we can help . Yeah . You see , Marty and myself have had a Iot of experience with ... - people like kickin ´ people around . - Harassin ´ them . I got an idea . Why don ´ t we stop for some coee ? Don ´ t stop ! Get o this drive ! We ´ re like sitting ducks here ! Easy , man . We ´ re on your side . We ´ re just tryin ´ to help . Chase One to Top Guy One . We ´ ve got him on the Lower Drive . Copy ? Copy . We ´ re right above you . Two sedans have been following us , standard government issue . - He ´ s right about that ... - Bob ! - I want you to lose those cars . - Lose ? How do you suppose I ... ? There ´ s a construction site over the bridge . When we get there , I want you to follow my instructions exactly , understand ? Bob , if they can make me disappear , they can make you disappear too . Chase cars , pull up alongside the cadillac . Let ´ s find out what Peter has in mind . Something ´ s goin ´ on here . Do they look like Feds to you ? Who knows ? Peter , I ´ m worried about that gun goin ´ o by accident if we hit a bump . - Got something to worry about . - Across the bridge when the light changes ? We ´ re not gonna wait for the lights to change , Bob . We ´ re not ? Go ! Oh , God , please , God , don ´ t let anything happen to my new car . Chase One to Top Guy One . He ´ s crossing bridge into fog . Losing visual contact . They ´ re finished . Let ´ s go home . That son of a bitch ! - Hey , watch where you ´ re goin ´ . - I can ´ t see anything in this soup . - Which way ? - I don ´ t know . - You go straight and I ´ II go left . - AII right . - Now what ? - Dunno . Hear anything ? I don ´ t know . Do you ? Yeah , I definitely hear something . Chase One , we ´ re in pursuit of the Caddy ! I see him . I see him . He ´ s over there , around to the right . - Jesus ! - How the hell was I ... ? There they are . Go on , get movin ´ ! AII right , get out . Both of you ! Leave the motor running . - I can ´ t believe it . Not a scratch ! - Throw your pieces in the lake . What are you gonna do now , Peter ? If you see ChiIdress , ask him if it was worth his arm . What happened to his arm , Peter ? I killed it with a machine gun . - Hey , Peter , now wait ... - tell ChiIdress to follow me ! I want him to follow me this time ! Not in my car , man . - Watch out , Bob ! - Peter , Iet ´ s talk about this ! gillian , I know you ´ re upset , but it ´ s silly . I was told CheryI has a history of nosebleeds . An ice bag stopped the bleeding . But what I ´ m trying to tell you is : I made it happen . - That ´ s impossible . - What about when you started bleeding ? A couple of weeks ago ? You said the cut was healed , and it opened right up . Don ´ t ! Why not ? Cos it could happen to you . gillian , I ´ ve had a Iong flight and I ´ m very tired . - I want you to stop carrying on like this . - Don ´ t be mad at me . Sweetheart , I ´ m not . I always thought we could tell each other anything , no matter what . We can . Mother , I Iove you . I ´ m afraid . - Afraid to let me touch you ? - Yes . Honey , I ´ m home and I ´ II stay here just as long as you need me , I promise . But what we really should do now is talk to someone . And Steve Brenneman has had wonderful success ... I ´ m not going to a psychiatrist . hello ? Oh , it ´ s you . That was a good one . really passionate . I need ... Listen , I ´ m a nurse . And if my phone ´ s tied up and they can ´ t get hold of me ... So maybe you could breathe for someone else tonight . I need ... I need your body , baby . Come on , baby , it ´ s me . Oh , my God ! Why do we always have to meet in this van ? CouIdn ´ t we go to my place , just this once ? Too dangerous . well , for the sake of argument , let ´ s assume that everybody at the institute has their phones tapped . - Nobody ´ s watching me , for heaven ´ s sakes . - They ´ re always watching . Raymond Dunwoodie was a psychic . If he ´ d had enough time , he ´ d have found Robin . But ChiIdress was watching him . How else do you think they got to me ? Why are you so afraid of this guy ? I ´ m not afraid of ChiIdress . He ´ s afraid of me . He knows I ´ II get my son back . Now what about those files ? I ´ m nobody . I just work there . I don ´ t have access to any vital secrets . You mean you didn ´ t get a chance to examine the files at Paragon ? - Yes , I did . - And ? Robin is ... - well , he ´ s ... - Dead . - According to the records ... - Of course that ´ s what they say . - ChiIdress keeps the records . - What if it ´ s true ? Hester , look at me . I ´ m proof . Proof that my son is alive , else why would ChiIdress be so anxious to put me away ? They ´ ve got him somewhere . You ´ re the only one who can help me . How long did you follow me around before taking a chance on me ? Too long . Thanks . Thanks for pickin ´ me . Hester , you don ´ t realise how beautiful you really are . Somewhere they ´ re doin ´ a hell of a Iot of research ... much more complicated than Paragon . God only knows what they ´ re doing to my son . Peter , if Robin is still ... I promise I ´ II do everything I can to help find Robin . But you take too much for granted . You trust too many people . Paragon Institute . It sounds like a haven for quacks . - But their references are good . - It ´ s right up there on the Ieft . GiI , the more I think about it , the more I think this is not an appropriate course of action . Mother , I Iike Dr Lindstrom . Anyway , I ´ m old enough to know what I ´ m doing . well , I don ´ t intend to let you stay here until they ´ ve answered a Iot of questions . - And I mean that , gillian . - OK . - Hi , gillian . - Hi . - Mrs BeIIaver , I ´ m ellen Lindstrom . - How do you do ? - please come in . - Thank you . Dr McKeever is busy monitoring a test , but he should be with us shortly . - Maybe you ´ d like to look around . - Thank you . I ´ ve been here before . - This was Babe Giord ´ s house . - Yes , we bought the house from the Giords . It was so beautifully furnished , we tried to make as few alterations as possible . In fact , gillian ´ s suite is particularly attractive . - I don ´ t know why you want GiIIian to stay ... - That was my idea , Mrs BeIIaver . gillian and Katherine BeIIaver , this is our director , Jim McKeever . How do you do ? - GiIIian . - Hi . Young people stay with us all the time while they help with our evaluation programme . Thanks , ellie . We can do a betterjob ofjudging psychic ability if there ´ s a minimum of distractions . Of course , it ´ s not all work and no play . There ´ s a good library right here and a game room down the hall . - Do you play backgammon , gillian ? - Yeah . Good . And our housekeeper is the best Irish cook in Chicago , I ´ m sorry to say . I ´ d like to know what kind of programme you ´ re talking about . certainly . Why don ´ t we look at one of our workshops ? TeIepathy is a timeless form of communication . Now my five-year-oId daughter was very good at this . But the older and more sophisticated we become , the more we rationalise what our senses try to tell us . This is all GiIIian will be doing ? Yes , this and similar tests , under my personal supervision . We ´ II take good care of her , Mrs BeIIaver . I ´ II be fine . Don ´ t worry . I ´ II see you in a couple of weeks , OK ? AII right , but I ´ II call you when I get to Paris . - You know where I ´ m staying if you ... - Yes , Mother . I ´ II be fine . Goodbye . - Goodbye . - Goodbye , Mrs BeIIaver . - Nice meeting you . - Have a good trip . Oh , my God ! It ´ s beautiful . Do you Iike it ? Look at this . It ´ s great . I ´ II start unpacking . Look around , make yourself comfortable . This is beautiful . - " Paragon . " The best there is , right ? - Something that can ´ t be equalled . Like the incredible power of the human mind . We hope you learn to use that power to develop your gift . It ´ s not a gift . It ´ s more like having a bad tooth and never knowing when it ´ s gonna hurt . That ´ s because a part of the mind you ´ ve never used before becomes sensitised . - Sensitised to what ? - The biopIasmic universe . Come again ? The biopIasmic universe . In that universe is a record of every human impulse , word and deed . Of lives past and lives to come . occasionally you make a connection between the timeless world and the physical world . You have what cIairvoyants call " a vision " . But it ´ s never about me , though . I never see anything about me . Guess I ´ m glad I don ´ t . I ´ ve been thinking . We should have a little treat . - Just for ourselves . - What ? Hot fudge sundaes , vanilla and chocolate ice cream . - Hester ... - Bananas , maraschino cherries , coconut , strawberry topping , - whipped cream all over the top . - No , stop . Oh , my God . You guys . If I don ´ t finish these tests soon , I ´ II be so fat , you ´ II have to roll me outta here . - well , have fun . - Thanks . Come on . You ´ ve earned it . You ´ re right . What the hell . Besides , what are you talkin ´ about ? You look terrific . - Not after this . - Do you have a boyfriend ? No , no one special . What about you ? Pretty slim pickings around here . - Yeah , Paragon is just ajob . - well , do you have a boyfriend ? - Have I got a boyfriend ! - What ´ s he like ? well , he ´ s very charming . Swept me right o my feet . - In the park . - In the park ? - Yeah , he picked me up in the park . - What was his line ? He said he needed help . Some line . - What are you talkin ´ about ? It worked . - True . What does he do ? Do ? well , he travels around a Iot . Where ? well ... all over . When he comes to town , we go to parties . He loves people . He takes me out dancing , buys me presents ... He dresses beautifully , and he ´ s a good dancer . The only trouble is ... he ´ s very hard to get hold of . Come on . Let ´ s dig in . You mean gross out . Look at this . When I was your age , I had one great ambition . - To be Fred Astaire . - Oh , my God . As you can see , I failed miserably . I took dance for a couple of years . My mother insisted . You see , she didn ´ t think I was any too graceful ... Don ´ t touch me any more . please don ´ t touch me . Oh , God ! God ! What happened ? Tomorrow we do real tests , make things as challenging as possible for gillian . nelson , as soon as GiIIian begins to show her psychometric talents , I want complete audio and videotape records of the tests . - will she be working in the Faraday cage ? - No , this girl ´ s no cheat . She ´ s the real thing . Now ... Do we have any bIeeders in the group ? No . Anyone who ´ s had even minor surgery in the past three months ? How about ulcers ? Hester , Kristen , Lorraine ... If you ´ re into your monthIies , I don ´ t want you around during testing . - Are you serious ? - I ´ m very serious . gillian ´ s power to psychometrise is spontaneous . She creates an enormously powerful electromagnetic field . almost everyone exposed to it will bleed . Some will bleed a little , some a Iot . What is this kid ? A vampire ? You wanna continue working here ? Then I don ´ t wanna hear any more funny remarks like that . - How do you account for it ? - We can ´ t . Not yet . gillian ... can you hear me ? It takes a while for the EvipaI to take eect . ellie , please . gillian ... what did you see on the stairs ? A boy . Robin . Have you seen him before ? Yeah . I have . gillian and Robin were in touch teIepathicaIIy . Think what we could do if Robin were alive . - I ´ m sending her home . - Jim ... - Why ? - I don ´ t wanna be responsible for gillian . - I don ´ t think you mean that . - I don ´ t wanna talk about it any more ! It ´ s late . And we ´ re both overexcited . Listen , I don ´ t understand something . This is a marvellous opportunity for us . We only had Robin for a few days , but I think that GiIIian really wants to work with us and she is the best subject for psychic research I have ever seen . ellie ... even the most backward tribes , the most primitive cultures on Earth , would welcome the birth of a Robin Sandza . And in time he ´ d become their magician , their prophet , their great healer . There is no place for these kids in our culture . They ´ re superior to what we hold sacred . And what a culture can ´ t assimilate ... it destroys . Jim , what really happened to Robin Sandza ? He was running on the steps , takin ´ them two or three at a time . He ... slipped and went through the window . - But why was he running ? - I don ´ t know , ellie . I wasn ´ t here . Jim ... Why don ´ t you come up to my place ? - I mean , I ´ II scramble some eggs ... - No , I ´ m ... I ´ m gonna finish this . Then I ´ m gonna stretch out on the couch for a couple of hours . What time is it ? My watch has stopped . It ´ s a quarter after four . Excuse me . It ´ s later than I thought . Thanks , ellie . well ... Good night , Jim . Good morning . What do you want ? My arm hurts . It ´ s dead . Why should it still hurt ? You ´ re the brain expert . So tell me . Is it all in my head , Doctor ? It ´ s an oversimplification , but there ´ s nothing I can do . That ´ s not why I came here . tell me about GiIIian BeIIaver . My people always know what ´ s going on here , even if you ´ re slow to keep me informed . will the girl be another Robin Sandza ? - No . - really ? Poor Peter . If he only knew that Robin doesn ´ t care any more , doesn ´ t care if his father ´ s alive or dead . - What the hell have you done to that boy ? - He ´ s being treated like a prince . He is . He ´ s royalty , unique . The Chinese don ´ t have one , the Soviets don ´ t have one . In all the world , there ´ s no one quite like Robin Sandza ... unless it ´ s this girl . How can you hold him against his will and get any kind of results ? Against his will ? You don ´ t understand Robin ´ s needs . We do . Are you testing the girl today ? She ´ s failed every test . She ´ s a fake . I ´ m sending her home . - I don ´ t have time to waste on people ... - Don ´ t do that to me , Doctor . Don ´ t ever try lying to me . For God ´ s sakes , she ´ s just a child . She doesn ´ t know anything . She has no control over what she ´ s doing . Robin had no control when he came here . Just raw ability . Doctor ... I wish you could see him now . For God ´ s sakes . I want you to get yourself together , stop fudging your responsibilities . This girl is important to me . I ´ m assigning extra security . Why ? If I know Peter , he penetrated your security weeks ago . He probably knows I have GiIIian BeIIaver . I don ´ t know who his confederate is ... but I ´ m looking into it . - She ´ s all right . - Try that one . I will , I will . Kristen , where ´ s Dr McKeever ? He ´ s checking out the new testing equipment . - Do you know when he ´ II be back ? - He said not before dinner . - Where ´ s GiIIian ? - Having breakfast . I couId use a cup of coffee myself . A club ... Good morning , gillian . You ´ re not eating much . I ´ m not very hungry . Did you hear what happened yesterday ? Dr McKeever ´ s hand started bleeding . Yes , I do know about that . well , what are you gonna do about it ? I mean , it ´ s why I ´ m here , isn ´ t it ? Can ´ t anybody help me ? gillian , we have to work together . gillian . Do you remember much of what we talked about last night ? Last night ? - Were you here last night , Dr Lindstrom ? - That ´ s all right . while you were with Dr McKeever , you had a vision that upset you . You were in a fugue state for a while . We gave you something to help you relax and I suggested that you consciously forget whatever was troubling you . And apparently ... it worked better than I thought . So you don ´ t remember anything about Robin Sandza ? No . Who ´ s Robin Sandza ? He ´ s a boy your age ... with powers like yours . Like me ? well , where is he ? I mean , do you think I couId talk to him ? Do you know him ? I feel like I do . What can you tell me about him ? He ´ s ... He ´ s not very clear . He ´ s ...

We want a two-dimensionaI view of the field potentials . We have a mild electrostatic field fluctuation . We have dierentiation between the P and T waves . Heart action slightly arrhythmic . Let me have that eIectroneurogram reading . pulse 66 . Pressure 114 / 92 . pulse steady at 67 . Pressure 115 / 94 . Robin , we ´ re going to show you a film .

I need to talk to my mother . Do you think I couId call my mother ? You can talk to your mom in a little while , but you ´ ve had a shock and you need to rest . - Here . - What is that ? It ´ s a sedative . It ´ s like aspirin . You take aspirin , don ´ t you ? Here ´ s some water . Drink plenty of water . That ´ s a good girl . I need to see Dr McKeever .

She ´ s beginning to show signs of consciousness . - It had to be a cerebral haemorrhage ... - " She ´ s a fake . " You were gonna send her home . Is that the kind of cooperation I can expect , Doctor ? I want GiIIian BeIIaver at the PSI facility tomorrow . Do we let her mother know ? She ´ s wealthy , with powerful friends . gillian can ´ tjust dis ... Peter , it ´ s impossible . I ´ II never be able to get that girl out of that place . I ´ II blow it . Getting out of Paragon is a hell of a Iot easier than getting in . - What do I say to gillian ? - tell her everything . tell her what they did to Robin . They ´ II do the same thing to her . - What if she won ´ t listen ? - I don ´ t have much time . That girl can lead me to Robin . - She was doped the Iast time I saw her . - Everything ´ s set for tomorrow . Tomorrow ? I need your help . please . You feel all right , Robin ? You know , that wasn ´ t a very smart thing to do . You could have been very badly hurt . Why were you running away ? You didn ´ t have to use the window . There is a door . Yeah , Iike they ´ d really let me just walk out the door . Why didn ´ t you come to me ? Because you ´ re one of them . I just wanna get outta here . I hate this place . I hate these doctors and the tests . They ´ re driving me crazy . I can ´ t even sleep . And you want to get away from me , too . Is that it ? - What do you care ? - well , I care very much . What ´ s the matter , Robin ? Don ´ t you trust me any more ? I don ´ t know . But you do want to get out of here , don ´ t you ? Yeah . AII right . Then we ´ II go together . - Go where ? - GiIIian ! well , I have this place in the country , north of Chicago , in Lakeview . gillian ? You can do whatever you Iike .

I ´ m not bleeding . - You know where Robin is ? - Yeah , I do . would you Iike to see him ? I need to see him . well , I think we can work that out . How ? Dr McKeever says I ´ m supposed to give these to you to keep you happy and harmless . - Do you know what I mean ? - No . What ... ? You ´ II have to pretend you took them because I have to get you out of here tomorrow . - Otherwise you could be in trouble yourself . - What are you saying ? What is going on ? Oh , honey , I ´ ve got so much to tell you . would you Iike a drink ? You look tired . I am tired . How ´ s our Boy Wonder ? Those films have unleashed an incredible emotional force . He ´ s developing the power of an atomic reactor . - Or an atomic bomb . - What are you giving him to calm him down ? Every day he has 3000mg of phenobarbital and 1000mg of ProIixin . On trial days we ... What ? That ´ s enough to kill him . Drugs no Ionger have any eect on him . We ´ ve pushed him too far . He ´ s quite unstable . - He flies into rages over nothing . - He could be dangerous . - What ´ s he trying to prove ? - mentally , Robin has developed this perfect psychotronic relationship with all kinds of machines . And so naturally he ´ s trying to do the same thing now with his body . Except that physically , he ´ s just ... adequate . And when he faiIs ... he ´ s intolerable . How is he performing in bed ? Robin wants to please me . That ´ s the main thing , isn ´ t it ? He needs a rest . No more tests for at Ieast a month . Sorry . He ´ s been under tremendous pressure . We plan to get away , just the two of us . No . We almost lost him once , Susan . I promised . I promised him we ´ d get away , together . AII right .

Are you planning on seeing them later ? No , Robin . I ´ m with you . Remember ? Which one are you gonna screw first ? Robin , come here . - Get away from me ! - Robin , please . Oh , my God ! Top Guy Two , this is Top Guy One . Do you have any coee left ? Top Guy One , that ´ s an airmative . I ´ ve got about a cup of lukewarm coee left . You wanna negotiate a trade ? Top Guy Two , I have one Hershey bar to trade . Top Guy One , I read you . Is that with or without almonds ? AII right , asshole One and asshole Two , stop cluttering up this frequency . Isn ´ t Dr McKeever back yet ? I ´ m afraid not , Hester . He ´ s still at the hospital with ellen . Can I help ? Dr McKeever prescribed medication for gillian this morning , but we ´ re all out of it . He was very specific about using a nonbarbiturate . - So I guess I ´ d better go to the drugstore . - Fine . Hey . - Are these ready to be mailed yet ? - Yeah , why ? - I couId take ´ em to the Post Oice for you . - That would be terrific . I ´ d appreciate that , Hester . Here , these go in .

That ´ s the best thing in the world for a toothache . tell me about Robin . You tell me . It ´ s just that ... sometimes I know what ´ s happening to him , what he ´ s thinking ... what he ´ s feeling . I ´ m ... like a receiver , and Robin sends me pictures . Jesus , that ´ s amazing . You ´ re like twins . He ´ s a good-Iooking kid . You ´ re the kind of girl Robin would Iike . I raised him myself . His mother died at childbirth . How come you didn ´ t marry again ? well , there just hasn ´ t been anybody . Hester ? Yeah . Hester . When was the Iast time you saw Robin ? About 11 months . He ´ s been growing up so fast . You know , I ´ m a good athlete , but he ´ s better . The last day at the club , we raced in the pool , about ten laps . He beat me , but I said I won . He said " No , you didn ´ t . " I said " I did too . " He jumped up on the side of the pool and said " We ´ II do it again . 20 laps this time . " I was so dead , I couId hardly drag myself out of the water . I said " AII right . You won , you won . " tell me , gillian . How is he ? He ´ s OK . OK . Yeah . We ´ re all gonna be OK . That ´ s a promise . Peter ! Stop ! please , Iet me o ! I ´ m supposed to get o here !

Look , that bus ´ II take you to seattle . I paid the driver . You ´ II be safe . You can ´ t leave me . Get on that bus and stay on it . Peter ! But I can take you to him now . Peter , I was Iying before . Robin ´ s not OK . He needs us now . It ´ s too dangerous . people around me get killed . Dammit , people around me get hurt too ! I make them bleed ! Robin can help me . please ! Oh , Jesus ! - Why did you do that ? - I don ´ t like it when you smell like this stu . could you just leave me alone for a little bit , Robin ? I got tired of waiting for you . What ´ s taking so long ? - I wanted to have a bath and a little privacy . - But you ´ re taking too goddamn long ! Is everything all right , Dr charles ? Yes , everything ´ s fine . When the others arrive , would you just hold them downstairs for a moment ? I need a few minutes in here , OK ? I ´ II call you . Thank you . Robin ? I ´ m sorry . Try to understand the strain I ´ m under . I ´ m very worried about you . Don ´ t be sorry . I didn ´ t mean to act like that in there . It ´ s me . I ´ m OK now , though . - I ´ m OK . - Good . well , I ´ m starved . Do you want something to eat ? Sure . well , this looks great . I ´ ve been thinking , Robin . Maybe we should take a couple of days o . Get a boat , go up the lake or something . What do you think ? Why did you do that ? So nobody can get in . What ´ s the matter , Robin ? - You know what ´ s the matter . - No , I don ´ t . What is it ? It ´ s that goddamn girl . What girl ? - The one that ´ s like me . - What do you mean , Iike you ? You think I don ´ t know she ´ s around ? She ´ s right out there . - There is no girl . - That ´ s a lie ! - No , it isn ´ t , Robin . - She ´ II do everything I can do , won ´ t she ? And you won ´ t miss me at all . What are you trying to say , Robin ? - Company ´ s coming . - Yes , you know that . There ´ II be you and me ... and Dr Ives ... and ChiIdress . And that girl makes five . No , only four , Robin . You can see that the table is setjust for four . That ´ s right . I won ´ t be here . I ´ II be dead . That girl ´ s taking my place after you poison me ! What ´ s the matter , Susie ? What ´ s the matter ? - Oh , God ! Robin ! - Remember ? - I said I didn ´ t have to touch you to hurt you . - Robin , please stop ! - well , I ´ m hurting you now ! - Stop it ! Cos I don ´ t Iove you any more ! I ´ m tired of you ! You ´ re killing her ! Stop ! Stop ! No ! Susie , get up . - I said get up . - Robin ! God , stop ! I can make you get up . Turn around . Up . Robin ... Up . Oh , God , Robin ... Up . No , please . Turn around . Again . Faster . Faster . Faster . Faster ! Faster . Turn ! Again . Turn . Faster . Faster ! Here . Gimme your hand . Hi , pal . Thought I ´ d drop by to say hello . Long time no see . You ´ re lookin ´ good . Too bad , Peter . You almost made it . Where ´ s my son ? Why don ´ t you give up ? You ... Oh , God ! Shit ! Stop ! Stop ! AII right , Peter . You said you wanted to see your son . Go ahead and get him . Robin ? Can you hear me ? Robin ! please answer me . Oh , my God . Robin ! Where is he ? What have they done to you ? Son , I know they told you I was dead , but ... they wanted me out of the way . I never gave up . I kept lookin ´ for you all the time . Come on , Robin . Hey . Don ´ t you recognise your old man ? Peter ! No ! Hang on , Robin . Reach up with your other hand . Come on . Grab ahold of my jacket . climb over me . That ´ s it . Come on . You can do it . That ´ s it . That ´ s it . No ! Oh , God ! Robin ! AII right . Get ´ em outta here . Get ´ em outta my sight . Good morning . I made some coee . would you Iike some ? No ? It ´ s warmer by the fire . How did you sleep ? OK ? I was here most of the night . I guess you don ´ t remember . Move a little closer to the fire . I know what you ´ ve been going through these past couple of days . I know how exhausted you must be . It ´ II take more than one night ´ s sleep . I know how I feel . Peter was my friend . Maybe the best friend I ´ II ever have . But I had to do what I did . I mean , you saw what happened . Peter could have saved Robin . Instead , he let him go . He deliberately killed his son . I hope you don ´ tjudge me too harshly . I can ´ t say what I did was right or wrong . I only know I acted ... and it ´ s done . Robin is gone . Peter is gone . And you ´ re the only one who matters now . Yes , I know that hurts . That hurts so bad , you wanna lie down and die . But you have to survive . You ´ re a healthy , strong , young girl and you must survive . You ´ II begin by putting all the tragedies behind you . I think that ´ II be easier if you accept my help . AII the bad things you heard about me just aren ´ t true . I ´ m not a bad man . AII I want is for you to trust me . Time will take care of the hurting . That ´ s the simple truth . Tears are good . Don ´ t be afraid of crying . Tears are just what we need right now . I ´ II be a good father to you , gillian . You can depend on that . gillian ! Where are you ? Where are you ? You go to hell !

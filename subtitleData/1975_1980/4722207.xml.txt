 'The year is 1987 'and NASA launches the last of America 's deep-space probes . 'In a freak mishap , Ranger 3 and its pilot , Captain William " Buck " Rogers , 'are blown into an orbit which freezes his life-support systems 'and returns Buck Rogers to Earth 500 years later . ' I came immediately , Miss Cosmos . Your message sounded urgent . Thank you , Captain . I realise that being so far from my home planet creates its own anxieties , but since I 've been aboard your cruiser , the Lyran Queen , I sense that someone has been watching me . That 's very regrettable , Miss Cosmos , but this is , after all , simply a leisure ship . We have no special safeguards for our passengers , no matter how valuable . I just wanted you to know my concern . Your quarters are comfortable ? More forest scent , perhaps ? Everything 's fine . I 'm enjoying the cruise . And we enjoy having you on the cruise . We don 't often have a passenger so ... Promotable ? - You 'll be at my table for dinner . - Thank you . - I 'll see you at 1800 hours . - Captain . Deploy a security unit to the stateroom area . ( Buck ) ' Wilma , I 'll see your 20 credits and raise you ten credits . ' That 's a very unusual game . - Where did you get these ... ? - Cards . Twiki made them . - I thought you 'd enjoy it . - I think I 'll ... spindle . - Fold . - Fold . Wilma , how about you ? I could be here another 500 years at this rate . - Fold . - All right . That leaves ol ' lucky Buck with three - count ' em - three nines . We all know what that means ... - Bidibidibidi . Not so fast , bub . - What have you got , Twiki ? Five pictorial units of the same subset , presented sequentially . A royal flush . Come to papa . - It 's like losing to a typewriter . - Watch it , bub . - How about something to eat ? - Nice idea . Er ... what was all the commotion this afternoon at the Comm Centre ? Something about a Lyran Queen ? Oh , yes , the luxury liner the Lyran Queen took off from here two days ago with a highly publicised passenger aboard , a Miss Cosmos . - Miss Cosmos ? - Mm . A beauty pageant winner ? You still go in for that sort of thing ? Beauty contests are much more sophisticated than they used to be . It 's what 's inside that counts . Literally . Yes , indeed . Genetically speaking , Miss Cosmos is closer than anyone to the perfect example of the female human . What do Miss Cosmos and the Lyran Queen have to do with your job ? Oh , well ... Someone tried to rob or kidnap her yesterday . A woman with extraordinary powers . We haven 't been able to get a positive identification but we believe her to be one of a pair of notorious thieves which up to now have specialised in inanimate objects of great value - but now have turned to ... - Bodies . Bodies . Exactly . And in this case , a body of staggering genetic value . So , under the circumstances , the Stellar Authorities have asked for our help . Would you like for me to intercept that ship and look after Miss Cosmos ? Well , that would be very good of you , Buck . After all , the prospect of meeting the perfect woman is fascinating . Yes , I would think so . Well , you 'll be in charge of general security . Not being one of our agents makes you less suspect . Wilma , I 'm gonna need your help . - How could I refuse ? - I play a mean game of shuffleboard . - Huh ? - Shuffleboard ? Well ... another tribal custom bites the dust . ( PA ) ' Will arriving passenger Buck Rogers please report to the bridge ? ' The energy from that creature is tremendous . Are you sure this device can stop her ? Theo assures me it will . It puts out coruscating light strong enough to stop an elephant . You must understand , Captain Rogers , that whoever wants Miss Cosmos will stop at nothing . They 're after her genes . They can freeze her body tissue and sell it at a staggering profit . I understand your concern , Captain . I 'll do everything I can to keep her alive . Shall we go and meet Miss Cosmos ? ( Buzzer ) Miss Cosmos , this is Captain Buck Rogers . - I 'm sure you know , he 's from the ... - 20th century . Of course . - Pleasure to meet you , Captain . - Buck . - The pleasure 's mine , Miss Cosmos . - Call me Tara . The Captain has volunteered for the Earth Defense Directorate to see to your safety , Miss Cosmos . - Thank you . - I 'm sure you 're in capable hands now . If you 'll excuse me , I have a ship to see to . I 'll leave you two alone . Gammon , Marek , why don 't you accompany the captain ? You did say you wanted a tour of the ship , didn 't you ? - Can I get you something to drink ? - No . It 's a little early for me . May I ? Very nice . Been painting long ? Excuse me for staring . I 've never met a 500-year-old man before . I 've never met a genetically perfect woman before . Think of the permutations . I 'd ... love to think of the permutations . Maybe later , after we 're sure the danger 's over . ( Buzzer ) Come in . Hi . - Ready for lunch ? - Almost . Jay , what are we going to do on this ship for three weeks ? What we have been doing . Enjoying ourselves . - Mixing with the other passengers . - You 've seen how bad I am at that . Alison , this trip wasn 't my idea . It was the neuro-med 's . All she said was I needed a rest . Couldn 't I have rested in New Chicago ? Jay , I 'm sorry . It 's just that I 'm always so scared to try new things . - Why do you stay with me , anyway ? - Because I love you . Now , I 'll meet you up at our table in ten minutes . We 're going to eat and we 're going to have fun . 'This is your captain speaking . 'You 're all aboard so we 're accelerating to light speed 'for a slow , leisurely cruise to Stargate 1 . 'After that , we 'll enter the Vega system , 'where we 'll make our first stop on Sutter 's World , 'a planet renowned for its fair climate , colourful indigents 'and remarkable hospitality . ' Bidibidibidi . Wilma 's looking real foxy . Hold it right there . You are everything I 've ever wanted out of life . - And couldn 't have . - Hold on . I 'm Gurney Langston Jr . I 'm from the Boston Complex . Rhea Durant . New Manhattan . The Durants of Manhattan ? This is remarkable ! Your family owns Regel II , my family owns Regel III . We 're practically neighbours . We must have dinner tonight . Buck , I don 't understand what Colonel Deering is up to . Wilma is setting herself up as a target no thief or kidnapper can pass up . When you put out the honey , you get as many flies as you do bees . I wish you would refrain from using such antiquated verbiage . It makes it so difficult to follow you sometimes . Boodiboodi . Something from the bar , sir ? Bidibidibidi . Hold the phone . - Nothing for me , thanks . - Boodiboodi . Bidibidibidi . Boodiboodiboodi . Bidibidibidi . Boodiboodiboodi . Bidibidibidi . Twiki ? Twiki , where are you going ? Don 't ask . It looks as if Miss Cosmos is packing it in for the day . Soon I 'll start patrolling the stateroom areas . 'There will be a lecture tonight on the origins of Sutter 's World 'in observation room 3 on level J . ' - Excuse me , are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . You don 't look fine . I 'm all right , really . I 'm very sorry to bother you . That 's OK . My name 's Buck Rogers . - Alison Michaels . Thanks , Buck . - Don 't mention it . Have you been ill ? Well , um ... Jay , my boyfriend , took me to a neuro-med in New Chicago and she found nothing really wrong , just hypertension . She suggested a rest and that 's why I came on this cruise . - But it 's not working . - You 'll be fine . I 'll help you back to your cabin . - Alison , are you all right ? - Oh , Jay ! It happened again ! I went to sleep and when I woke up I was wandering around . Honey , you 've just got to relax . This is Buck Rogers . He helped me back here . Buck , this is Jalor Davin . - I appreciate your help . - My pleasure . Why don 't I have the ship 's doctor stop by ? We 've been to the best neuro-meds . I doubt a ship 's doctor could tell us anything new . - But thanks again , Buck . - Sure . - Take care of yourself . - Maybe we 'll see you at the banquet . Yeah . I 'll drop by your table . Bye-bye . I don 't like him . You don 't like any of my friends . Why do you do this to me ? - Do what ? - Treat me like a child . - Like I can 't take care of myself . - Alison ... You 're sick . - I 'm just trying to look after you . - I 'm not sick ! Yes , you are . You 're very sick , Alison . I 'm not ! I 'm not sick ! ( Laughs ) Stupid , weak , snivelling little creature . How do you put up with her ? I like part of her . My part , you mean ? Something happened in the stateroom area ? Somebody installed some kind of energy curtain down there . The closer I got to it , the more it drained my power . I can 't get past it . I 'll take care of it when Miss Cosmos is at dinner . Good . Then after dinner , I 'm going after those Denebian moon crystals . - The woman from New Manhattan ? - That 's right . Why do we go through this every time you see a pretty jewel ? We 're here for Miss Cosmos , Sabrina . I want them . Go after all the Denebian moon crystals you want . Another time . Now just concentrate on Miss Cosmos . No . We 'll do it my way . I want them and I 'm going to get them . All right . Just let me check her out . We 'll see about relieving this Rhea Durant of her walking jewellery collection . Dinner 's in 20 minutes . I need Alison again . No ! Not so soon ! Someday you 'll take her over completely . But now ... I hate her ! I hate her . I hate her . Hurry up , honey . We 'll be late for the banquet . ( Snickering and laughter ) This is comfortable enough , but I think we might have updated . Bidibidibidi . It 's the latest fashion on Klausa Three . - How am I supposed to eat with this ? - Just point it at the food . Activate the switch at the base of the fork . A null-gravity fork . The latest word in dining accoutrements . It 's great if you like your food on the hoof . Where 's your girlfriend ? I thought you had a date . - Bidibidibidi . She gets off work at ten . - What 's her name again ? Her name is Tina , and I think her interest in Twiki is purely physical . - Physical ? - You 'd better believe it . - Physical , huh ? - Bidibidibidi . Twiki , I 'm gonna give you your first assignment . I want you to contact Wilma and tell her to meet me in my cabin at 2200 hours . Bidibidibidi . No problem , Buck . - Hiya , Twiki . - Hiya , babe . - Boodiboodi . - Bidibidi . Tina , this is Buck . - Pleased to meet you . - Charmed , I 'm sure . - Are you hot to trot ? - Ready when you are . Twiki , are you actually going down to the dance chamber ? Bidibidibidibidi . Right after I see Wilma . - Bidibidibidi . Bidibidibidi . - Boodiboodi . Now I 've seen everything . Excuse me . I 've got business to attend to . Why , yes . By all means , Buck . But before you go , would you please turn me 60 degrees to the left ? Sure . - How 's that ? - Perfect . My circuitry periodically needs a touch realigning . Sure , Theo . Oh . I hate to say it , but now I don 't feel very well . I 'm gonna lie down for a while . You just stay here . - Not by myself . - Hello , everybody . - Leaving so soon ? - I 've developed a headache . Do you mind if I keep Alison company while you take something for it ? Fine . Alison , I 'll see you back at your cabin . I 'll be up as soon as I 'm finished . - Please sit down . - Thank you . - How 's everything going ? - That 's none of your concern . Mind your own business . It 's my neck if you get caught . All I have to do is make a life scan of the ship and they 'll find her . All you have to do is make sure everything operates normally . We 're going to install an anti-spectrometer . The scanners will never know anyone was in here . What happens when you leave ? You can 't just walk off the ship with Miss Cosmos under your arm . That 's exactly what we 're going to do . You and Jay seem to have a nice thing going . - How long have you known him ? - A year . - Yeah ? How did you meet ? - How does anybody meet anybody ? We met at a bar . I 've forgotten exactly where . I 've been so many places . But he 's very good to me . He 's strong . I like that in a man . - You enjoying the cruise ? - Honestly ? - Yeah . - No . Come on . Eat . That stuff is good for you . Or so they tell me . You 're joking . I haven 't heard that ... Alison ? Are you all right ? Yeah . I 'm fine . - You were saying ? - My parents died when I was little . My mother used to tell me to finish my food . I haven 't heard that in a long time . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to upset you . No , you didn 't . I don 't know how we got onto it . She 's a very attractive lady , isn 't she ? Yes , she 's absolutely gorgeous . 'The formal dining room will be available for seating after 1830 hours . 'Repeat , the formal dining room will be available for seating after 1830 hours . ' An electro-mag sensor programmed for only a few specific patterns . As soon as I recover from whatever it is I have , I 'd like to see New Phoenix , maybe even move there . I 'm really sorry , but I 've got to go . I just remembered something . That 's OK . Maybe we can talk again sometime . Sure . 'Please join us for cocktails in the Astral Lounge on F Deck . - Here we go . - Hold it , fella . What do you think you 're doing ? You still don 't know who 's responsible for the attempts on the beauty queen ? No , but I think your pair of super-thieves are involved . How do you mean ? The captain told me of a super-strong woman with psychokinetic powers . 'We 'll need some heavy-duty defences . ' - What do you have in mind ? - Just to be on the safe side , I 'd like you to send me a few sonic pistols on the next cargo run . - ' And some earplugs . ' - I 'll send them as soon as possible . Buck , I can 't tell you how much I appreciate what you 're doing . It must be difficult working so hard when others are enjoying themselves . If living my life vicariously through Twiki counts , I 'm enjoying myself . - Twiki ? - Remember him ? The little silver guy ? He 's developed a very active libido . I should have a talk with his programmers . That 's not a bad idea . It 's too late for that . Prepare for the patter of little metal feet . - The what ? I beg your pardon ? - Never mind . I 'd better sign off . If I come up with anything , I 'll get back to you . Out . Little metal feet ? ( ♫ Disco ) Boodiboodiboodi . What a good dancer you are , Twiki . Bidibidibidi . Buck taught me all I know . They call this one The Bump . - Bidibidi . Uh-oh ! - I 've never seen a dance like that . - I 'll take the jewels , if you don 't mind . - Actually , I do . Denebian moon crystals . For an impostor , you have very good taste . You see , to become good at this , which I have , one must always be sure of one 's intended victim . There 's a Rhea Durant in New Manhattan , all right , but she 's very reclusive . She 's also 82 years old . 'Make your reservations now for the sightseeing shuttle . ' Wilma ! The Denebian crystals your attacker stole have a highly distinctive molecular structure . Buck 's monitor should be able to pinpoint their location , and therefore the location of our unusual thief . - Except I 'm not getting any reading . - Let me see . Oh , dear . This is unfortunate . There seems to be some interference , something jamming the signals . Could it have something to do with the woman ? She was physically powerful and able to fire those blasts of energy . She 's probably a mutant , so she 'd give off a tremendous energy field strong enough to block our tracer . That , unfortunately , seems all too likely . Wilma , if that woman is a mutant , can 't she carry protective colouring , like a chameleon ? If she can become anyone she wants to , how are we going to find her ? No , wait a minute . - Suppose she 's two people . - That doesn 't make any sense . I think it will . There 's someone I want to do some checking on . - Hiya , Twiki . - Bidibidi . Buck . Bidibidibidi . Hi , guys . What 's the matter , Twiki ? It 's only 0300 hours . - I 'm bushed . - ( Theopolis ) Now , just a minute , Twiki . If you think you 're going to retire without hearing from me , you 're incorrect . Your behaviour since you set foot on this ship has been abominable . Twiki ? Twiki ? Twiki ? Twiki ! 'This is your captain speaking . 'It 's 0900 hours . Breakfast is now being sewed on the observation deck , 'where you 'll be treated to a spectacular view of William 's comet , 'something you won 't want to miss . ' - ( Alison ) Yes ? - It 's Buck Rogers . Come in . Hi . You 're not going to breakfast ? No . But I 'm glad you dropped by . I didn 't know who else to turn to . - I think I 'm going insane . - I doubt that . No , I am . I used to just get tired and have these dizzy spells . But now ... I 'm having nightmares with my eyes open . And it 's like I 'm hurting people . I have never wanted to hurt anybody in my life , and maybe that 's why people have taken advantage of me . - But I 'm scared . - Tell me about these nightmares . - I don 't want to think about it . - Please try . - No . - OK . Take it easy . Come on over here and sit down . Now ... I think I may know what 's wrong with you . I 'd like to try to help . You promise me to stay right here . - Let me go get a friend of mine . - A doctor ? Well , sort of . Trust me . No ! Go away ! No doctor for me , Buck Rogers . Hello , Buck Rogers . My name is Sabrina . I wouldn 't if I were you , Captain . If you 'll take care of the light curtain , we 'll get on with this . And do it quietly . Miss Cosmos is dining inside her room this morning . Forget it , Sabrina . I suggest you think about the welfare of your friend . - What friend ? - The brunette with the fancy jewellery . The one who tried to trap me . - The one I nearly killed last night . - I don 't know what you mean . Fine . Then you won 't mind when they find Rhea Durant dead later today . Kill her . Wait ! All right . If anything happens to me , you first , and then your friend , will die . - Thanks , Buck . - Don 't mention it . Let 's get her . This is what you were supposed to prevent . Miss Cosmos is gone . Issue an order that no vessel is to leave until it 's searched . Shuttles arrive every day . All of them will undergo a life-form scan . The pilots will ask questions , spread rumours . Stop worrying about bad publicity . This woman 's in danger . Yes , of course . Let me go . Where am I ? Where 's Buck ? Call for him . He won 't come . Sweet dreams . - What 's gonna happen ? - Not a drop of blood will be spilled . Microtomic lasers are neat and tidy . The anti-spectrometer . Put it over there , just by the door . I know where it goes . What is that thing ? ( Jay ) Something that will fool any scanner they might use to find her . Let 's get on with it . That 's all we can do . The laser will draw power from the ship very slowly so that the monitors will not detect . When it peaks , the laser will be in full effect . Its blade will start dissecting her quite automatically . Sleep well , dear . We have a big day tomorrow . - You 'll have my payment tomorrow ? - When we leave . - I want it sooner . - Fine . We 'll pay you tomorrow morning , then you can leave . OK . We 'll have to kill him too . Come on . - What 's wrong ? - No ! - Go away ! - Not now ! Leave me alone . I want to stay ! Alison , I 've been looking all over for you . You poor thing . You 're ill , that 's all . Yes , I am . I 'm sick and I need help . I want help and I 'm not getting it on board this ship . We 're at Sutter 's World in three days . You can catch a cruiser back to Earth . No ! I 'm going to New Chicago tomorrow , with or without you , Jay . Whatever it is that happens to me , I 'm no longer gonna let it run my life . ( Theopolis ) What you are suggesting is that Alison Michaels is a transmute - a split personality with the genetic ability to transform itself in times of stress into one of two or more separate entities . All we have is a theory . We can 't act without evidence . Then we have to capture her as Sabrina . Dr Theopolis , the light curtain in the stateroom . Can it be intensified ? Why , yes . Easily . - Bidibidibidi . Mail call . - Thank you , Twiki . - What is that ? - It just came through the shuttle bay . Sonic pistols plus earplugs to protect those using them . I 'll tell you how to beat Sabrina and bring Alison to her senses . ( ♫ Disco ) Do you mind if I cut in ? Is that a promise or a threat ? - Take your choice . - Oh , yeah ? They have a policy against letting passengers leave except at authorised stops . I 'm sure they make exceptions for medical emergencies . You don 't really want to make a scene , do you ? I want to get well ! Let 's go . Hi , Alison . - Hello . - Mind if we join you ? - Actually ... - Please do . Tina . Drinks for everybody , on me . Right away , Buck . Nothing like a little chat among friends , is there ? - Depends on the subject . - Let 's try the past . Yours , specifically . I made some enquiries today . I know about your conviction for selling stolen property . - Let 's get out of here . - I want to hear this . Your boyfriend 's just using you , Alison . He doesn 't care about you . Only what you can steal for him through someone you become . The blackouts ? I turn into someone terrible , don 't I ? Someone cruel . - Someone who steals for you . - Don 't get yourself excited . Why ? Are you afraid of her ? Maybe I ought to let her show you what I think of you . Would you like that ? Would you ? Yes , Jay . Let me show you . Let me show all of you . Little Alison was right about one thing . She doesn 't need you . She doesn 't need anybody . Let 's get to our posts . ( Shrill tone ) Bidibidibidibidi . Far out . ( Shrill tone ) ( Shrill tone ) ( Shrill tone ) ( Shrill tone ) ( Shrill tone ) No ! No . Please ! I don 't want to go back ! Don 't make me . I won 't go ! Won 't ! ( Groaning ) Alison ? Alison , can you hear me ? Alison ? - Are you all right ? - I think so . Good . Can you tell me where Miss Cosmos is ? Can you remember where she is ? I can 't . Alison , try . She 's in the disposal room on level B. Take good care of her , Wilma . ( Tara ) Help me ! That was a little close for comfort , Tara . ( Sobbing ) ( Huer ) ' Alison Michaels checked in to the Directorate clinic . ' Reports indicate she 'll be just fine . Just a modicum of therapy and all Sabrina 's powers will be gone forever . - ' Alison says thank you , Buck . ' - Tell her it was my pleasure . Is there any word on Jay and his accomplice ? 'They were picked up by Directorate police . 'How 's Miss Cosmos after her ordeal ? ' - Quite all right , Dr Huer . - ' I 'm glad to hear it . ' I owe Buck my life . I 'll never be able to repay him . We 'll work something out . 'I imagine you and Colonel Deering are anxious to get back to Earth . ' Oh , yeah . Right . You bet . - ' You can catch the next shuttle back . ' - What was that , Dr Huer ? 'I said I 'd ... ' There 's an awful lot of subspace static . You 'll have to speak up . 'Buck ? Colonel Deering ? ' Come in , Dr Huer . Dr Huer , can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? I guess not . - Now , how about dinner ? - Bidibidibidi . Now we can get it on .

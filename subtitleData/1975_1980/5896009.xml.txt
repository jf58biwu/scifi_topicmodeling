 25.000 Mysterious voice : They must come to us . They must come . They must . Blake . Jenna . Sorry to wake you , but I think you should get down here . What 's wrong ? Our speed 's increasing . Can 't you compensate ? It 's not an external influence , it 's us . The primary drive is accelerating . All right . I 'm on my way . Well ? Speed standard by three and building . How quickly ? If it continues like this it will be off the scale in about twelve minutes . Zen says the automatic repair service should have it under control by then though . Seems to be a malfunction in the PN overrides . Zen , estimated repair time ? Eleven point three zero two minutes . Whew ! That 's cutting it a bit fine . What caused the malfunction ? The malfunction was deliberately induced . Deliberately induced ? Cally ! Cally , what do you think of the outfit ? Cally ? Speed standard by four and building . - Avon ? - Yes . I need you on the flight deck . I 'm busy . NOW , Avon . Zen , how are the repairs going ? They are proceeding on schedule . What caused the malfunction ? Well ? Involvement is not permitted . If the ship 's blown up , lofty disinterest won 't save you . Speed standard by five and building . Forward detectors on maximum . Full scan . Abort course programs . Key all navigation systems to anticipate potential collisions and neutralise . Confirmed . Avon . - All right ! - If it was all right , I wouldn 't need you here . Our leader seems a bit piqued . - What are you doing ? - A little private research . Which are the forward detector links ? - What ? Oh , those two there . - Why do you want to know that ? I 'm interested in your work . Yes . Well , I suppose I 'd better go and see what it is that Blake wants . What exactly are you accusing me of ? I 'm asking if your researches have included the PN overrides . I haven 't been anywhere near them . Speed standard by six and rising . There is a partial malfunction on the forward detectors . [ ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE ] Forward detectors are now dysfunctional . Navigation computers have switched to theoretical projections . Now we 're blind as well . But who ? - Cally . - What ? It 's Cally . Warn Gan and Vila . Gan . Respond please . Yes , Jenna What is it ? I should regret the necessity to kill you . Why are you doing this Cally ? They must come . Move back to the flight deck . Look at the burns on her hand . She must be in agony . I will kill you if you do not obey . Speed standard by seven . Speed seems to be increasing by . So it was you . Must you invite death ? Navigation computers can 't cope with a change of course . We 're running blind . Don 't move . Jenna 's right , Cally . This ship 's out of control . We 're as good as dead now Zen , what 's our speed ? Standard by eight point six five . If you 're trying to steal the ship , there are other ways . You 're not Cally , are you ? They must come to us . They must . They must They must come . Whoever you are , it 's over . Thank you , Jenna . What was all that about ? - Better keep her sedated . - And locked up or dumped . - You should never have brought her on the ship . - And where have you been hiding ? All I said was " what do you think of the outfit ? " Repair monitors report explosive device attached to primary power channel . Where ? Hold three , access duct seven . Can the automatics neutralise it ? - No . - Why not ? There is no damage . Computer logic . Until the bomb explodes there is nothing for the repair system to repair . Zen , can you reprogram the automatics ? Pre-emptive interference in crew activity is forbidden . Oh , he 'll clear up after us , but he won 't stop us making a mess . You made this mess . - We 're all in it , Avon . - Yes , aren 't we . - You better lock her in . - I will . - Anything on the detector scanners ? - Not a thing . Speed 's up to standard by ten . Drive repairs , how long ? One point two five minutes . Can you stop us then ? If we don 't hit something first . Forward detectors ? Repair monitors are assessing the damage . A bomb was all we needed . Be careful of that thing . If the light goes out you 've got about 3 seconds . Look out ! [ EXPLOSION ] Major disruption of primary power channel . All systems switched to auxiliary power . All drive units are dysfunctional . Thank you . Why ? Automatic reaction . I 'm as surprised as you are . I 'm not surprised . We must make ready . We must make ready . Ready . Ready . Ready . They approach , drawing closer . Closer . Closer . We must make ready . It wasn 't what she was doing . It was the way she was . If you looked into her eyes it wasn 't her looking back at you . - Avon says that 's because she 's an alien . - Everyone 's an alien to him . He 's certainly more at home with machines . The navigation computers have completed a theoretical projection of Liberator 's position . - And ? - This star system is largely uncharted . Marvellous . We 're not sure where we are , but if they were sure they wouldn 't know where it was anyway . Repairs to the primary power channel are complete . All drive units are now fully functional . Reduce speed to standard by point five . Reverse primaries . Speed now standard by point five . Put up navigation projection . Circles indicate projected planets . Positions are unconfirmed . Well , put up our estimated position . That 's too close to something we can 't see . And we 're not sure is there . What about the detectors ? Partial malfunction is still not traced . Repair monitors are in phase two reassessment . Gan , see if there 's anything you can do to help Avon . Tell him we need those detectors now . Right . Hull sensors indicate a major gravitational field within Liberator 's ambit . Jenna , compensate the gravitational drift . - Our speed 's dropping . - Field drag ? Field strength 's only three point five . It must be something else . Limited range forward vision is available should you require it . - Why couldn 't you tell us that before ? - Put up forward vision . What is it ? Meteorite dust ? Strands like that ? Look , there 's more of it . It 's rubbing across the hull . - And it 's getting thicker . - It 's like a spider 's web . - Some spider . - That 's what 's pulling our speed down . Increase power to compensate . It 's getting worse all the time . If there is a planet there we should be close enough to get signals now . Vila , go and see how Cally is , will you ? - Must I ? - It 's not catching . - It brought my head out in lumps . - Get a move on . All right , I 'm going . - Nothing wrong with that . - What are you trying to do ? Bypass the detector comp and use another of the systems to receive the signal . Can it be done ? Of course . It 's just a matter of finding the link . Some of this technology is a little more advanced to that which I 'm used . I 'm having to guess at some of it . What about the automatic repair system ? Oh , it 'll do the job . Eventually . It 's very methodical . It starts at the beginning and it works its way through . It 's slow . You should appreciate that problem . No , that wasn 't the one . It 'll take days to repair that . On any ordinary computer system . But this isn 't any ordinary computer system . A malfunction of that size would register on the auto repair . It should cut in in about five seconds . Watch . It will be cutting in about now . That is fantastic . Yes , isn 't it ? As a matter of fact it is . We could make a fortune with it if it wasn 't for Blake . In what way ? There 's always a market for technology like this . I don 't think Blake would agree to that . There will come a time when he won 't be making the decisions . Cally ! It 's all right . She doesn 't remember a thing . - How did I burn my hand ? - It was an accident . Look , we 're very close to a planet but we don 't know what it is . I can 't find any transmission sources . Will you please run the checks for me ? Sensors indicate increasing density of silica based organic material adhering to the hull . - About spider 's webs . - Hmmm , what about them ? They 're used for trapping food . Anything ? I 've tried all recognised systems but there 's nothing . No transmissions of any kind . We 'll move out . Go back the way we came . Without detectors ? Blind backtracking is a good way to run into pursuit ships . We 've no choice . If we get clear then we can outrun them ... if necessary . Sensors register increasing gravitational influence . Field strength now eight point six . We 're moving closer into the planet . Vila , I want a new course . Locate the centre of that gravitational field . I want an attitude that takes us directly away from it . Right . Jenna , stand by to bring her round . How much reserve power is there Jenna ? Jenna ? What 's wrong ? What is the matter with her ? I don 't know . Vila , give me a hand . We 'll take her to her quarters . We have waited for your coming for many years . Welcome . It pleases us that you are here . Who are you ? We will meet shortly and then we shall answer all your questions . For now , it is only important that you understand the danger of your situation . Danger ? Your ship is trapped . You cannot free yourselves . We can free ourselves at any time we wish . You underestimate the power of our ship . On the contrary . You overestimate it . We have examined your ship most carefully through our daughter Cally . You would require to sustain your maximum power for 160 hours to break out of orbit . Your energy cells would be exhausted in less than a hundred . Gravitational attraction would draw you back to your present position before your cells would be recharged . If we are trapped , then by whom ? We do have some influence on your safety in that it is within our power to release you from the web . That we can and will do in return for assistance from you . What do you want from us ? In a few moments we will transmit a homing signal It will give you a precise landing position . We will talk again when you have landed . Listen . It has left her . Blake , that could 've been one of the Lost . Well , don 't be mystical , Cally . Explain ! It is the legend of my people . They were cast out . Unfit to share the soul of Auronar . [ HOMING SIGNAL BEEP ] Yes , it is a beacon signal . - Get a fix on it . - Are you going down ? Not if I can help it . I don 't like the sound of anything I heard . Let 's try to pull her out of here . Ready to go about ? Jenna ? Are you all right now ? Yes . Of course I am . Yes . Vila is the course set ? Uh , on the panel now . Lock onto it , Jenna . She 's responding very slowly . Coming round . That 's it . Locked onto course . Right . Give it all we 've got . Full thrust . Coming up . Full power . - Speed ? - Standard by one half . Cut in the auxiliaries . That 's helped at bit . We 're now up to standard by one and one half and building but slowly . - Vila . - Yes ? It 's time to use the neutron blasters . At last . I 've been looking forward to this . Take it easy . It might blow us all up . See if you can blast a hole through that web . Fire . [ ALARM ] Neutron flare shield has not been activated . Which one 's that ? Activate the neutron flare shield ! Confirmed . Blasters are cleared for firing . [ NEUTRON BLAST ] I did it ! We 're picking up speed . All right , now keep it going . It 's closing up . We 're getting drag again . We 're slowing down . Fire again , Vila . [ NEUTRON BLAST ] Power banks one and two now exhausted . Energy drain exceeds recharge capacity . Every time I blast a hole in it , it just knits up again . How long can we sustain this rate of power loss , Zen ? Standard drive plus auxiliaries can be sustained for ninety hours . Each neutronic discharge reduces that capacity by three hours . How much distance have we covered ? One hundred spacials . We 're not going to make it . All power off . All off . What will you do ? - We don 't have much choice . - We 're drifting in again . Let her go Cally , get an exact fix on that beacon . Tell Avon to stand by I 'm going to have to teleport down . Vila , I want an atmosphere and gravity check . There is little time left . They will come to us , but it must be soon . There is little time left . They will come to us , but it must be soon . There is little time left . Soon . Soon . - Set ? - Ready . - I must come with you . - No . - But you can trust me . - Really ? I know we can . Whatever 's down there can control you . It 's already demonstrated that . - I was unprepared . - So were we . It 's better that you stay here . If I call for backup , get down there fast . We 'll be ready . Gan , keep an eye on Cally . What if something should happen to you and we can 't get you back ? Then all you have to do is get everybody else out of this mess . All right , put me down . [ TELEPORT WHINE ] Keep back . Help us . Help us please . Come inside . There are more of them in the compound . You are hurt . Come , I will treat the wound . Why did you kill him ? He was no threat . One of them obviously was . But don 't worry , it was only a Decima . You were lucky . It could have been much worse . We 've had groups of more than 50 of them in this area . Can you close your hand ? The tendons are not cut . What is it ? Don 't be alarmed . It 's a simple enzyme culture . Tissue regeneration will take only a few moments . I 'm sorry this happened . The Decimas are becoming a problem . When we have full power again we will reduce their numbers . He was asking for help . Don 't waste your sympathy . They want help to destroy us . Stupid they may be , but they know that our power is diminished . That we are at our most vulnerable . There only hope for a future is to wipe us out . They 've made several full scale assaults on the lab . They can 't do too much harm of course . Their weapons are too primitive . But they are a threat . And they will have to be suppressed . There , you see it 's dead . That is astonishing ! A useful technique for small wounds . I 've never seen anything like it before . Our mission has specialised in tissue creation and regenerative processes . Among other things . I am Novara and this is my sister Geela . Blake . We are happy to see you . We thought your ship would land . How did you come here ? We have a teleportation process . Fascinating ! Perhaps you would explain it to us . I thought you had already examined our ship . Not all of it . You used Cally to sabotage us and force us to come here . Would you have come otherwise ? Perhaps . In that case , we apologise . You communicated with us through another member of my crew . A simple mental process known to the ancients . We have developed and refined it . It is more reliable than mechanical transmissions . You said you have a way to free us from the web . That is correct . We created " the web ' as you call it . What is it ? It is a silica based life form . A mutation not unlike fungus . Its spores germinate rapidly and it has enormous tensile strength . It can trap and hold the most powerful ship . What 's it for ? It was a line of research , which got out of control . Then how do I release my ship ? We developed a fungicide that can be projected by a beam . It will clear a corridor through the web . You will be able to move freely . However , that is where the problem lies . The problem is both yours and ours . And so presumably the reason why you brought us here . Let us show you . Come . You recognise this ? Power cells ? Flutonic power cells . As you can see from the registers one of them is totally exhausted . The other almost so . And you have no means of recharging them . No . When we have used what remains , our life support systems will fail and we will die . But , perhaps more significant from your point of view , we do not have enough power to project the fungicide . So you want me to provide fully charged energy cells . And in return we provide clear passage out of orbit . I don 't know that we have this type of cell . I dare say we have something that can be adapted . Then you agree ? [ SHOUTING ] Dwarves ? Decimas . The attack was a diversion so they could move their dead . Stupid creatures . Taking of life seems to affect them . Almost as if they had emotions . The changes in them are astonishing . Earlier generations showed no indication of aggression . Are you going to contact your ship ? - Blake . - Cally . Tell Avon I need two fully charged flutonic power cells . I will tell him . - Call me when he 's ready to bring them down . - Understood . Ask him what 's happening down there . No , he 's gone . He didn 't sound as if he was in trouble . He 'd have found a way of letting us know if he was . But the Lost have great power . Why would they need these cells then ? I 'll go and tell Avon . Flutonic power cells ? The detector malfunction has been rectified . Full function on all systems is now available . Run immediate navigation check and pinpoint our position , then a maximum range orbital scan . Detectors indicate unidentified craft at extreme range . Put them on the screen . There they are . Pursuit ships . Don 't they ever give up ? Zen , are they coming this way ? If they maintain present course and speed they will pass at a range not exceeding two million spacials . Their detectors will pick us up at that distance . That 's too close . Shall I tell Blake ? - There 's nothing he can do till we 're out of the web . - But he should be told . If he 's bargaining it will weaken his position . You 're very practical . Complete . The beam is now aligned to your ship . When we have full power this control will project a ray that will clear a route through the web . It will take three hours to close in again . Should be enough time . What was the original purpose of the project ? Genetic engineering . The main aims were to halt the aging process in humans . To find a way to maintain continuous life . Immortality . And to create a new species of animal . Creatures designed to perform simple menial tasks . Animal machines that cost nothing to produce and little to maintain . Experiments like that have been banned for centuries . Which is why we had to establish our laboratory on an uninhabited planet . Were any of these creatures made ? Yes . We engineered an efficient four function animal . Using the same basic genetic form we then increased it to ten functions . The Decimas . You made the Decimas ? The prototypes . They breed naturally , but a mutant strain has become dominant . They seem capable of thought . They exhibit primitive emotions , weaknesses we thought we had eradicated . They will all have to be eliminated so that we can be certain the mutant strain is destroyed . They 're intelligent , living creatures . You can 't just wipe them out . We gave them life . We have the right to take it from them . Please don 't concern yourself . They 're simply laboratory constructed animals as are we . You ? You are made ? We were genetically engineered , allowed to grow to maturity , then our aging processes were stopped . We have no lives of our own . We are simply flesh and blood creatures operated by our creators . Ha ha ha . You seem confused my friend . We had intended not to meet with you . However , you will be leaving us shortly . No harm can come from your knowing us . Geela will bring you . Come with us , please . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Blake . - Avon . You ready ? One of the flutonic power cells is fully charged . The other will be ready in precisely two minutes . Get them down here as soon as you can . There 's something else . The detector banks are now fully functional . They 've located the pursuit ships and they 're coming this way . Have everybody standing by . We 'll move out as soon as we 're both back on board . Good . I 'm sorry . You must excuse me I have not spoken with these lips in a long time . My name is Saymon . That is the name by which this body was once known . I am a corporate identity . We exist through this body . We ? We were from Auron . There were six of us when we set off on this project . Unfortunately , our knowledge was not far enough advanced then to eliminate death . But we did possess the power to keep alive our thoughts and ideas . The bodies reverted but the minds lived on . Cally 's people . The Auronar . Yes . We were from the Auronar but not of them as Cally is . That 's why you were able to control her . That is why we had to control her . She would not have accepted us freely . You are the only one of the six that is left ? Mechanical aids sustain this body . Through it all six of us continue to live . Our combined mental powers generate Geela and Novara to carry out all our experiments . They have no life of their own ? None . If our life support should fail , they would simply wither away . Thanks to you and your energy cells that will not occur . So that all I have spoken to them about , all they have told me , that was you talking , not them ? Correct . And did you mean what you said ? You 're going to destroy the Decimas ? It would have been wiser to have done so before they became so numerous . But to discharge a lethal level of radiation required more power than we had available . But the cells I 'm providing will give you that power ? Of course . No . I can 't let that happen . Without that power you cannot escape the web . Then we must come to a new understanding . You won 't get those cells until we do . Avon stay on board until you hear from me . This is Vila . Don 't teleport Avon until I say so . I just did . I put him down about ten seconds ago . He 'll be in the compound now . If the Decimas reach him , he 'll be in danger . Those power cells must be protected . I don 't give a damn about your power cells . There 's a friend of mine out there . We will help . You take that side . You take that side . And I 'll go straight on . I 've been looking for you . What 's going on ? Let 's get under cover first . Got the cells ? What do you think these are , field rations ? There 's a problem . If we let them have those , they 'll use them to wipe out an entire race of creatures , people , here . If it concerns you , don 't give them the cells . No , there 's more . They 've got a carrier beam , which projects a fungicide , which will clear a way through the web for us . It doesn 't work without this power . Ah well , if it 's between the creatures and us there 's no argument . Even your irrational conscience should be able to cope with that . What do you want to do ? Hold off long enough to make a deal . You 're going to have to be quick , Blake . Those pursuit ships are coming this way . I 'll hide these cells . They can have them when they agree to our terms . What ARE our terms ? They can use lethal radiation to kill everything out here . If they allow us to destroy the radiation equipment at least the Decimas will have some form of chance . Why should they agree ? They need the power . They can 't survive without it . Neither can we . I 'll bear that in mind . Don 't worry . I 'll remind you . Let 's get back inside quickly . Where are the cells ? He didn 't bring them . We 'll get them when we 've talked . You are lying . You will get them when you agree to our terms . Put your weapon down . Do it ! You . Now , the cells . I didn 't bring them . Minimum power . A full charge would cut you in half . Understand . Your lives are totally unimportant to us . All right . Quickly . The cells . - I will irradiate . - No ! Novara . [ SHRIEKING ] Right , that 's the beam . These are what you wanted to protect ? - They 're fighting for their lives . - Who isn 't ? Aaaarrhhhh . Look . He did it . We 're free . Not yet . Let 's get out of here . Blake . We 're ready . Bring us up . Aaaarrhhhh . Navigation computer to evasive action strategy . Key course and speed to optimum escape probability . Basically , lose them , Zen . Confirmed . - One thing they proved back there . - What ? Biological machines will never replace the real thing . They 're far too unpredictable . At least the Decimas stand a chance now . You can 't separate living creatures . Being alive involves them together . I couldn 't agree with you less . It 's a fact of life . Zen , when we 've lost the pursuit ships , resume course for Centero . Confirmed . I 'll tell you a fact of life , Blake . Change is inevitable . Why else would we fight , Avon ?

 [ Dog Barking In Distance ] [ Louder Barking ] [ Boy ] Get him , dog . Go get him ! Go get him ! Get him , dog ! Get him ! What 'd you find , huh , what ? Did you get him ? All right , dog , that 's enough . That 's enough , I said ! It 's only a human . [ Loud Noise Approaching ] [ Crash ] Come on , dog . [ Beeping ] [ Machinery Humming ] [ Humming Decreases ] [ Barking ] Open it ! What is it , Prefect ? I don 't know . Keep your guns ready . I suppose we should go in . - Can I go too , Father ? - No ! - But I found it , didn 't I ? - I said no ! All right , let 's go , go ! He 's dead . [ Boy ] It 's a human ! I thought I told you to stay outside ! And look , there are two more of them . I wonder where they are ? We 'll find them . You 're not to say a word about this , understand , Arno ? Why not , Father ? It 's so exciting ! It 's dangerous ! Humans know their places . That mustn 't change . If they were to find out that other humans ... could build and fly a machine like this , they 'd begin to think they 're as good as we are ! But , Father , look . These humans must be better than we are . You 're not to say such a thing again ! You 're not even to think it ! I want this body buried at once . If you ride fast , you should be in Central City by tomorrow morning . Give this message to Chief Councillor Zaius . Hurry ! I want a thorough search for the other two humans ! Arno , get off that thing ! [ Moaning , Mumbling ] [ Mumbling Continues ] Watch out . Watch out ! No bones broken , I checked . - Ooh ! - [ Chuckles ] You gotta take that very slowly . Do I ? What is this place ? How 'd we get here ? I don 't know . I just got on my feet too . - Where 's Jonesy ? - I don 't know that either . Here , try it again . Like a hangover without the pleasure of the booze . I , uh ... I don 't even remember what happened . We were approaching Alpha Centauri . We ran into some radioactive turbulence , lost control . I told Jonesy to activate the automatic homing device . Did he do it ? Well , we landed somewhere . Could be Earth . Yeah , or any one of a thousand lousy planets- - Hold it , hold it . Something 's coming . Stay put . I brought you something to eat . Food ? Food ? Who are you ? Farrow . This is for eating . How did we get here ? We 're on Earth , aren 't we ? Take it slow , Alan . Give him a chance . - This is Earth , isn 't it ? - Earth ? What is Earth ? What is the name of this planet ? This is my secret cave . It doesn 't have a name . There was another man . What happened to him ? He was dead . PoorJonesy . He had a wife and kid . Yeah , so do you . And you 're probably just as far from them as he is . And maybe not . Come on ! Look at this fruit . You ever see anything like this ? And this place . You know what this looks like ? A bomb shelter , maybe a couple of hundred years old . They didn 't have bomb shelters on Earth a couple hundred years ago . I know , Pete . - Is our ship far from here ? - No . Can you take us there ? It wouldn 't be safe dressed like that , but we could fool ' em . I 'll go into Chalo and get different clothes . What 's Chalo ? Chalo- - the village where humans are supposed to live . I don 't like the prefect , so I stay most of the time here . Well , I found this place about two years ago . But I never told anybody about it , so you 'll be safe here . [ Pete ] Safe ? From what ? From the apes , of course . - I 'll be back as soon as I can . - [ Door Shuts ] Apes ? That 's what the man said . These two humans are strangers , and they are insane ! Don 't listen to them . Report their whereabouts to us at once ... if you should see them . I was just thinkin when I was a kid in Jersey City . I couldn 't even see the stars . Used to dream about them . Used to dream about being up there with them . [ Chuckles ] I sure got my wish , didn 't I ? Pete Burke marooned in an ancient bomb shelter . [ Chuckles ] Well , there 'll be a few ladies that 'll miss me anyway . We 'll get home again . Somehow . Come off it , Alan . This is home from now on , and you know it . I think I wanna see what it looks like . Hey , you heard what the old man said . Oh , sure . Apes . [ Laughs ] Amazing , isn 't it ? Just like Earth . Listen . [ Birds Chirping ] - We could 've landed in a worse place . - [ Gunshot ] [ Apes Yelling ] They won 't get far . Those were apes , weren 't they ? Gorillas . What kind of planet is this ? You are bright and amusing , Galen , but is that reason enough for me to accept you as my assistant ? Well , I do have one other qualification , Councillor Zaius . What , what ? My father is a very old friend of yours , and you owe him a favor . [ Laughing ] I 'll see if my master has an answer for you . Are you always so direct ? Only with people whom I respect , sir . Ah , ah . Yes ? Message , sir , from the prefect of Chalo . Chalo ? A small human settlement about 30 miles south of here . The prefect is a second cousin on my mother 's side . I see . And do you have friends everywhere ? - I try , sir . - You 're not only amusing- - It 's not possible . What 's the matter , sir ? Did you ever have a recurring nightmare ? No matter how swiftly you tried to escape destruction , it always reappears directly in front of you . I don 't understand , sir . Humans are laborers , farmers and servants . They 're not technicians . This is pure fantasy . Destruction is not fantasy , Galen ! You have a great deal to learn . - Are the apes in control all over the planet ? - I don 't understand . What he 's asking is who runs the government ? - The prefect . - I don 't mean just the village . I mean the main government . You mean the High Council . They 're very important . They sent a messenger to the High Council about you two . I heard about it . Are there any humans on the High Council ? Humans on the High Council ? Humans are nothing . They 've always been nothing . Except in storybooks . Always ? How could it be otherwise ? The apes are so much smarter than we are . All except for you two , I guess . You 're different . That 's why they 're looking for you . What 'll they do if they find us ? Kill you . They 're always killing humans . Oh , this is just a great little world we landed on . They 'd kill me if they knew about the storybook . What storybook ? I found it here . I found lots of other books too . But I couldn 't read what they had to say , so I used them for fire . But I kept this ' cause it had pictures in it . I like to look at the pictures ... even though they 're only stories . - Let me see . - Careful . It 's very old . Yes , I know . I will . Oh , my God , Pete . Oh , my God . The year 2503 ? This picture was taken ... 500 years after we left ! We can 't go home , Alan ! We 're on Earth . We 're there already ! Another ship , Zaius . It 's hard to believe . Can the chief of security afford not to believe it ? How reliable is this prefect ? Do you know him ? - Galen does . - I don 't believe a word of it . How could humans build such a machine ? We can 't even do it . Who is this fool ? Galen 's going to be my assistant ... maybe . There were three humans . One is dead , the other two are still at large . - They must be found quickly . - Yes , and killed . No , brought back . Questioned by the High Council . This is an infection . One doesn 't question it , one wipes it out ! - Just as we did before . - Not until we question its source . More than ten years ago , another such ship landed . Humans . They said they were from this world ... but from another time period long ago . I 've heard stories like that , but I thought they were stories . I never believed that it really happened . That 's what we wanted everyone to think . There were such humans , Galen . They called themselves- - What was the word , Urko ? Astronauts . Astronauts . Yes , hmm . What were they like ? They had greater knowledge and capabilities than our humans . And they had feelings of independence and freedom . Humans ? That 's fascinating . Not fascinating , Galen , unlawful ! They would have encouraged our humans to be equally unlawful . But the danger was eliminated . They were killed . Before they could be questioned ! My job is protection , not the gathering of useless information ! No information is useless . We have to learn how they think , Urko , what makes them different from the humans we know . Once we learn how to deal with them ... and any others that may come along , then they can be killed . You will go along and see that nothing happens to these ... astronauts . I don 't trust Urko . He won 't listen to me , sir . You carry my authority when you go as my representative . Yes , sir . I note a certain lack of enthusiasm . You may have a chance to visit your second cousin on your mother 's side . To tell you the truth , I never really liked him very much . These , uh , these astronauts , are they truly different from the humans we know ? Absolutely ! And they are a threat . However , I want them alive . For now . It 's a shame they have to be killed at all . They do sound so interesting . - Pete , you awake ? - Yeah . We must 've come through a time warp . We could be 500 years into the future . Or 5,000 . Everyone 's dead- - my wife ... my son . Alan , there 's nothing you can do about it . He said he 'd take us to the ship in the morning . If the chronometer 's still working , we 'll know what year it is . What did we do to ourselves ? [ Urko ] The errand boy is worried . - Aren 't you ? - No . No , just confused . I always thought humans were unimportant animals . So they are . Get some sleep . I want to make an early start in the morning . This way . It 's not far . Why bring the book ? You didn 't think I was gonna leave it behind , did ya ? Wait a minute . The apes aren 't looking for you . You don 't have to go with us . We 're friends , aren 't we ? Come on . I 'll get rid of him . Farrow , no ! Halt ! The two humans , I just saw them running off that way . Come on , I 'll show ya . Come on , the two humans , you can catch them . The year 3085 ? The year 3085 ? More than a thousand years in the future . Marvelous . Maybe further . That 's when it stopped working . Well , we 're just gonna have to find a- - [ Gunshot ] Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Farrow ! - Run ... run . - Farrow ! You 're gonna leave the old man out there ? Finish quickly . We have a long way . Didn 't you hear ? He 'll die ! You can 't just- - That old man tried to save our lives . You can 't let- - I 'm getting tired of listening to you humans . Urko ! No . Get ready to move out . Listen , will you look to our friend ? He 's dead . Move out ! How 's it coming ? A few more seconds . Okay , turn around . Uh-uh . Hi . You know , you could have been killed back there ... worrying about that old human . He was a friend . Is a friend that important to you ? Yes . Oh . You 're very unusual for humans . We 're also tired . We 'd like to sleep . [ Pete ] Yeah , really tired . [ Yawning ] Is it true that you are from this world but from another time ? Yes . Oh . [ Scoffs ] Now , how is that possible ? It just happened . We don 't know . Can we talk about this some other time ? Tomorrow ? I found this ... book back near the ship , and it had pictures , and it showed humans ... building things and running strange machines . It 's true . They did . [ Scoffs ] - That book can 't be true . - Yes , it is . Humans built big cities , machines that swam in the sea , through the air . And , uh , you kept apes in cages ? Why ? Well , apes were considered wild animals in those days . They weren 't as intelligent as you are . That is not true . - Sorry , buster , it is . - That is not true . No , it 's all lies ! Apes have always ruled the world . Always ! [ Hisses ] Y-You check their ropes . You make sure that they can 't escape . My master will be angry with me for letting you have this . I will be angrier if you don 't . Enemies of the state must be put to death ! I remind the High Council that this is our law . The law must be obeyed . What makes us enemies ? We haven 't done anything . Your ambitions , your thoughts are enemies . What 's your name , pal ? Hitler ? Stalin ? Mussolini ? Silence ! Do you believe humans and apes are equal ? - In this world or ours ? - In any world ! I don 't know about any world , but I believe that all intelligent creatures ... should learn to live and work with each other as equals . - [ Shouting ] - Silence ! They have convicted themselves ! Do you want this sacrilegious heresy to infect the rest of the humans ? Certainly not . And by questioning them , we will learn how to avoid it . Will you learn to avoid destruction ? What destruction ? We don 't intend any destruction . You 're human , aren 't you ? Would an ape have created such an instrument ? Urko ! You had no right to take that . There is the real threat ! There is the danger ! Very good , Urko . The object you stole from my cabinet ... has provided a most dramatic display , proving only the importance of keeping these two humans alive ... until we learn how they create such destruction ! So we can prevent it , if in future , there are others like them . - Yes , I agree . - It 's true . - Question them more . - I 'm sure even the great Urko ... cannot quarrel with this decision . I 'll quarrel with anything that keeps these two humans alive . You know what I expect you to do . After dark . - Zaius ? - Yes ? Was there ever a time when humans controlled the world ... and apes were kept behind bars ? [ Clicks Tongue ] I said you had a great deal to learn , but that didn 't include heresy . Maybe , uh , they were right , Zaius . Maybe the world would be better ... if no creature controlled another ; if all worked together as equals . I could have you imprisoned for that . Zaius , you haven 't answered my question . I never heard the question ! - Ullman ? - Yes , sir ? What 's it like ... being a human ? What 's it ... like , sir ? [ Chuckles ] Never mind . Yes , sir . Everything I saw in that book ... was true , wasn 't it ? We told you it was . Oh , it 's so hard to believe . You can say that again . I was always taught to believe that humans- - I mean , it 's just so- - Where you come from , are all humans ... as intelligent as you are ? Right now I think they were all twice as smart . Oh . Tell me , are there any humans in this world ... who build things , machines , anything ? Oh , no . - What about that grenade ? - Hmm ? That thing Urko exploded . - Who would know where it came from ? - Zaius , I suppose , but why ? That 's a good question . What difference does it make ? I 've been thinking . The input record of our flight is still aboard ship . Everything that happened from the time we left home until we landed ... back here on Earth is recorded on that magnetic disk . All we have to do is run it through a computer , analyze what went wrong , reverse the process and we can get back home again . - You 're out of your mind . - What 's a computer ? Maybe the humans who made that grenade are still on Earth . - Maybe they have the knowledge to- - - To what ? Build a spaceship and a computer ? - Yeah ! Maybe . - [ Sighs ] What is a computer ? Galen , you want to visit our time period , don 't you ? Oh , I-I really don 't know about- - It would be interesting , but I don 't think I want to . - Help us to get out of here . - What ? Certainly not ! Just because I find you interesting to talk to ... doesn 't mean I am willing to commit treason . - [ Scoffs ] - Okay , all right . I 'm sorry . I-I would like to talk to you some more about that book . Perhaps I could come back later tonight . - Be our guest . - Oh . Well , thank you . Yeah . Open up . I am sorry . [ Door Closes ] Nice try . Yeah . Nice try . Well , it 's about time . [ Door Closing ] [ Crunching ] - [ Object Hits Plate ] - [ Sighs ] I 'm still hungry . I said I 'm still hungry ! It 's a trap . Well , we 're dead either way . Watch out ! [ Gunshot ] What are the charges ? Murder of my lieutenant , treason , - aiding in the escape of two humans . - Is this true ? I didn 't mean to kill the lieutenant . But they planned the escape . They planned to murder the humans . - Is this true ? - Absolutely not . If you knew of such a plan , why didn 't you report it to me ? - There was no time . - He 's a liar and a heretic ! We found this book where he dropped it . Do you realize that possession of such a book alone ... is punishable by death ? Why , Zaius ? Why should truth be against the law ? I 'm sorry , Galen . I can do nothing for you . Do you know where an ape named Zaius lives ? - Do you ? - I still think you 're out of your mind . Will you take us there ? Will you ? You want something to eat , sir ? No . Go to bed , Ullman . I 'm going to read for a while . Hold it ! Don 't try to leave , or I 'll throw this thing and blow you to pieces . Cooperate and we 'll tie you up . They 'll find you in the morning . - What do you want ? - Where did you get this ? - A human ! - Who ? He didn 't live long enough to tell me his name . - Where did he come from ? - I don 't know . - I 'm warning you . - I know , or you 'll destroy me , as your kind once destroyed its world . - What do you mean ? - Your science and machines . Very few know your history , and very few will ever know . And your cities ! Death and destruction ! We don 't want them ! We don 't even want their memory . Oh , my God . Yes . You did it to yourselves , as you would do it again . That human was caught trying to sneak into the city . And , yes , I had him killed , as I will have you killed someday . As I must have poor Galen killed . - Galen ? - The infection you carry is fatal . All right . Now . You 're fools , you know ? You could have been out of the city by now . He saved our lives . You expect us to leave him here to die ? - You 're strange , humans . - Enough ! Now . [ Knocking ] - Again . - You can still escape . - Again . - [ Knocking ] Councillor Zaius ! Open the door ! All right . Back . Back ! I need some help out here . [ Door Opening ] - Alan , no key ! - Look again . [ Galen ] Who is it ? What 's happening ? - Who 's got the keys to your cell ? - What are you doing here ? - The keys ? Who has them ? - Urko , I suppose . - What are you doing here ? - No key , Al . All right . Get to the far corner of your cell , on the floor , face down , with your hands over your head . - Why ? - Never mind why.Just do it . Oh ! Can you figure that kook ? He really thinks that flight record is gonna get us back home . - How much longer ? - Five , ten minutes maybe . When are you going to give up that pipe dream ? When I see my family . They 'll be looking for us here . I 'm surprised they haven 't come already . It 's been a week , Galen . Probably stopped looking by now . Zaius ? Urko ? They 'll never stop . Never ! [ Clicks Tongue ] You okay ? I 'm sorry . You see , uh , I had family too . I had friends too . - You still have friends . - Hmm . I know . I just- - - What ? - Horses . Horses . Only apes have horses . They 're coming , Alan ! We have no time ! Just-Just about there . - [ Beeping ] - There 's the baby . Come on , Alan ! Let 's go ! See if they were here , then take care of the ship ! [ Explosion ] The ship ? I 'm afraid so . All right . Which way , Galen ? It 's your world . It 's yours too . Thank you , boys . Thank you , boys . All right . [ Sighs ] Let 's just start walking .

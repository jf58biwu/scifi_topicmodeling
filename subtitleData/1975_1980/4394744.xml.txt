 Well done , boy . Well done . A marvel , that 's what you are . A marvel . I wouldn 't mind being half witted if I could shoot like you . - Tea ? - Carrot tea . Mrs Cohen 's recipe . You shred the carrots and then you bake them . - Ugh ! - Well , it 's better than nothing . I can 't get used to not having a newspaper at breakfast . Well , that 's gone for good , I 'm afraid . I wish you 'd stay . One of us must eat with the others , Mr Russell . I can 't see why , I 'm afraid . But we can 't just leave all that stuff at the quarry . Of course not . But first things first . If we get a big enough patch dug , we can get all the spinach sown this week . You are keeping half of that for lettuce , aren 't you ? Yeah . Oh , one thing we 're not gonna go short of is iron . Onions . That 's what we need . - With an onion even paper is tasty . - JOHN : Paper ? Yes , paper . Come on , you two . Lessons . - LIZZIE : Reading ? - Reading and sums . JOHN : Oh ! Sums . John , come back . Finish your milk . Why do I have to nag you all the time ? Oh , Emma . Don 't pretend you don 't enjoy it . Nagging I can do without . There 's more than enough to do as it is . - Sums . - What ? Oh , it 's nothing . What have they got to count ? Chickens ? - Where 's Wendy ? - She 's in the kitchen . What 's she doing there ? She didn 't have her breakfast . - She said she 'd had hers . - She said ! Hmm ! Sums I can do . I can count eggs . - She 's gone without again . - She mustn 't do that . Nag , nag , nag . What more can I do ? The girl 's just skin and bones as it is . You can talk . In future she eats all her meals in here with us . Then you tell her . But what about that stuff at the quarry ? Charmian and I could go . We can both drive . I 've got digging as priority . We need all the men we 've got . Well , that 's why I 'm suggesting that Charmian and I go . - You 're not going alone . - That 's telling you , girl . Meaning a man 's got to go with us ? Good Lord ! That sort of attitude 's a bit out of date . Look , you 're not going and that 's that . Now , the stuff at the quarry 's safe enough , it can wait and the digging can 't . We 've got to beat the rain . Quick ! The pigs , they 've got out ! They 're in the cabbages ! ( SPEAKING IN CZECH ) GREG : Go on , then . ABBY : Come on . No , no , not this pig ... ABBY : Go on . Go on . ( ALL CHATTERING ) Go on , girls . Go on . GREG : Go on . Now , get it . PAUL : Go on . Go on . - Get out of the way . - Go on . - JOHN : Oi ! You . - Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . That 's it . Come on . Come on . Push them this way . Where the hell 's Tom Price ? Oh , come on , Greg . The boy ... I 'm telling you . That 's the whole of a crop gone . All our spring cabbage . And even the ones they haven 't uprooted they 've half chewed . Yes . But there are plenty there that are all right . So how do we keep them ? Pickle them . I 'm very fond of pickled cabbage . And where are we gonna get that much vinegar ? You 're gonna volunteer to go into the town and get some ? We could make sauerkraut . You need only salt for that . What a good idea , Emma . Every child knows that . Good . There you are . See . Look , you had the job of penning those pigs . - Well , it 's not my fault . - Well , you botched it ! Well , he did it . What do you mean he did it ? I told you to do it . - Well , I told him . - Well , you go no damn right to . Why not ? I can 't do everything , you know . - I told you to pen those pigs . - And I told him . It 's chain of command . Delegating responsibility . Yeah , well , passing the buck , you mean . Well , it 's the same difference . I mean , he sits in his backside all day . May I say something ? Price here asked my help . I did my best . Although it 's not exactly the sort of work I 'm most used to . However , I think you 'll find the real fault lies in the fact that the stakes were too flimsy . Hey ! Now , wait a minute . Wait a minute . There was nothing wrong with those stakes . I said so at the time and I say so still . The pig is a heavy and persistent animal . Listen to him talking . He 's too good for this world , he is . He won 't demean himself by eating with us . He doesn 't want to mix with the common herd . It so happens that the thing I value most in life is my privacy . Yes . And I know why , don 't I , boy ? I know that , all right . Don 't I ? What ? He doesn 't want to share with us . - I 'm not going to argue with you . - Now , hang on a minute . What are you talking about , Tom ? - Never mind . He knows . - No . Stop this innuendo . If you 've got something to say , say it . What are you talking about ? All right then . Food holding . That 's what I 'm talking about . Are you saying that Russell 's hoarding food ? Oh , no , boy . You 're not catching me like that . I 'm not saying nothing . Just ask him what he keeps in that briefcase of his . - Oh , what rubbish . - No . All right . What about it , Arthur ? My dear , Abby , if you 're going to tittle tattle from this ... GREG : Now , would you just go and get your case , please ? That briefcase contains business papers of a highly confidential nature . ( SCOFFING ) Confidential ! - Price , go and get the case . - No . I 'll get it myself . ABBY : ( SIGHING ) It 's not just Arthur . - Oh , he 's useless . - Agreed , but Charmian isn 't . The whole atmosphere of the place is going down . There 's a constant bickering . There 's just no cohesion . It 's pretty difficult to get any sort of cohesion in an ill-assorted bunch like that . Well , we have to or go under . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) - Where 's Vic ? - He 's with the kids . Oh , he 's with the children . ( SHUSHING ) Yes . Well , I 've asked you all here this morning because I got a few things I want to say to you all . Now then . To begin with , in future all members of the community , without exception , will take their meals here , in the dining room . Secondly , anyone found hoarding food or any other commodity will be asked to leave . - Asked . - Told . ABBY : Is that understood ? - Umm ... May I ask a question ? - Yes , of course , Emma . Is this a democracy ? Here , I mean ? I don 't know . I hadn 't really thought about it . You see , it 's all very well for you making all the rules , but I think the rest of us has some say in it too . Yes . Of course . Well , does anyone disagree with the rules that I 've suggested ? Fine . Now , then , does anyone know what today is ? CHARMIAN : Thursday ? ( ALL LAUGHING ) It 's May the 1st and I think we ought to celebrate . I think we ought to have a party . What does everyone say to roast mutton ? No , no , no . It would be too wasteful . You see , if we kill a pig , I can salt the rest . BARNEY : Me . - Barney , did you say something ? - Me ! I can kill a pig . Yes , but what about all the rest ? The butchering , the dressing , or whatever you call it ? Well , you 've got the book . You 've got to learn sometime . - All right ? - ( LAUGHING ) All right . ABBY : Arthur , can I leave you in charge of the drinks ? I 've got a bottle of brandy . The last . I didn 't mean that . Thanks to Vic Thatcher we 've quite a cellar . Hey , but you always said drinks were for emergencies . Well , I think this is ... I think that we deserve a party . Would you like to give Mr Russell a hand ? - Can a duck swim ? - But watch it . Everything in that cellar has to be accounted for . ( HUMMING ) I think if you put a bit more oil in it , it will be much better . But easy on the pepper , please . That 's one thing we shall never be able to grow here . Wendy , dear . Would you go and get as many dandelion leaves as you can for the salad ? But nothing very big . Nothing over three inches . - Get the children to help you . - All right , Mrs Cohen . ( INHALING ) Mmm . ( EMMA GIGGLING ) ( HUMMING ) This is the life , Pricey boy . # Potatoes , potatoes # Potatoes , potatoes # Potatoes # ( ALL SINGING ) # I want to go and play with the boy next door # With my friend Jeremy # I want to go and play with the boy next door # He 's spoke fair of me and he is only four # I want to go and play with the boy next door # Well , I agree , it 's only a question of morale . But then morale is only a question of leadership . - To some extent . - Absolutely . But it 's also a question of involvement . People need to feel they 're working for something . Towards some objective . Mere survival just isn 't enough . My dear girl , you tell them what the objective is and let them get on with it . In the meantime , my objective is to ask you to dance . May I ? Wendy , I 'm so sorry , but it 's high time the children were in bed . All right . - Did they have enough to eat ? - Tons . Tons . I 'm thirsty . You thirsty ? Now go and have a drink . But , Barney , be careful . Not too much . - I 'm thirsty . - Oh , that 's the ticket , boy . There we are . Get outside this . It 's a chaser , they call it , see . ( COUGHING ) It 's an acquired taste . But once you 've acquired it , you 'll be all right . It burns . No , no . It warms you . Can you feel it down there ? - Warms . - That 's right . Now have another one . And then the beer cools it . See ? I know he 's selfish . I know he 's difficult at times , but he 's been spoiled by power . He 'll have to get un-spoiled , won 't he ? CHARMIAN : Well , he 'll learn . You 'll see . Barney , what are you drinking ? Show me . Oh ! Really ! You ought to know better . It 's harmless . It 's a celebration , innit ? Where 's Wendy ? Wendy went upstairs . She 's putting the children to bed . - She will be back soon . - Dance . - She won 't be long . - Dance , Mrs. You . Me ? Oh , no , too old for this . Oh , no , no . ( EMMA LAUGHING ) - How do you do ? - Hello . - Can I have a dance ? - No , thank you . Come on . What do you say . I had medals for dancing . You 'll see . - Yes , I 'm sure . I 'm sure . - Come on . I 'd rather just look and listen . Thank you . All right then . To hell with you . ( GREG VOCALISING ) Barney , Wendy . Wonderful . ( EMMA LAUGHING ) ( SINGING STOPS ) ( ALL APPLAUDING ) Ah ! No , please don 't . I 'm a bit tired . - I 'd like to sit down . - Sit down . ( SINGING STARTS ) ( SINGING STOPS ) ( ALL APPLAUDING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) You all right , Wendy ? Yeah . Fine . I 'm just a bit tired . - Think I 'll go to bed . - Hmm ? - It 's the drink , I 'm not used to it . - Which one of us is ? - You know , you don 't eat enough . - Oh , don 't you start . Yeah , I think I 'll go up . Good night . Good night . Think you 'll sleep with all this going on ? Yeah . It 's nice . It 's company . - It 's cheerful . - Well , good night . - Good night , Mrs Cohen . - Good night , Wendy . Sleep well . - Good night , all . - ALL : Good night . ( DOOR OPENING ) - Wendy , are you going up there ? - Yeah . - Nice night , wasn 't it ? - Yeah . Smashing . You want some company ? No thanks . I 'm tired and I 'm going to bed . Look . You 're not frightened up there on your own ? No ! Well , now , I tell you . I 'd be frightened up there if I was you . - Well , you 're not me . - Yeah . Oh , please don 't do that ! - Wait there . Hey you ! - Leave me alone . Leave me alone . You 'll feel cold up here after than nice warm dance . Go away . Oh , come on , now . Don 't be such a spoilsport . Will you go away ! Oh ! Fancy one of the others , do you ? ( WENDY RUNNING ) None of us can be choosy , can we ? Wendy , come back here ! Wendy ! ( EMMA SINGING IN SLOVAKIAN ) - Are you tired ? - Mmm . A bit . - It 's the drink . I 'm not used to it . - Who is ? - Do you want to go to bed ? - No , not yet . Not just yet . - It 's funny all this . - What ? I was just wondering how far back we can go . - How do you mean ? - How primitive we can become . - Primitive ? - Well , reverting . I mean , like this shindig tonight . This do . It 's a pagan rite . - ( LAUGHING ) Is it ? - Of course , it is . First of May , dancing around the maypole , fertility symbols , rebirth of spring . Nymphs and shepherds . ( CHUCKLES ) Nymphs and satyrs . I 've never been at all sure what a satyr is . - Is it part man part horse ? - No , no . Goat . Oh . But they used to sacrifice things , didn 't they ? Yeah , so did we . Kill the pig . No , I didn 't mean that . I thought . Well ... - People . - Yeah . You 're right . You know , there are still some country people who ... Well ... I suppose there are still some country people who believe that blood , human blood , fertilizes the soil . Blood of a virgin . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) ( HUMMING ) ( GIRL SCREAMING ) LIZZIE : Quick ! Quick ! Quick ! Come quick ! - JOHN : It 's Wendy ! - Something happened to her . LIZZIE : Quick . Quick ! JOHN : It 's Wendy ! Something 's happened to her . Jenny , look after the children , will you ? TOM : What 's happening ? What 's the matter ? Wendy 's dead . Looks like murder . - TOM : Murder ? - She didn 't stab herself . Now , is everyone here ? Jenny . - She 's with the children . - Barney . - He 's with the sheep . - CHARMIAN : No . - Well , where is he ? - I saw him very early on . He was going towards the woods with his bow and arrow . - What with ? - GREG : What ? Could she have been killed with an arrow ? I suppose so . There 's nothing there . Barney ? Well , it 's one of us , isn 't it ? Oh , no , man , it couldn 't have been Barney . PAUL : Then who else ? You ? Me ? He was pestering her a lot last night . EMMA : That doesn 't prove anything . I know it doesn 't prove anything . I still think we ought to talk to him . Better beat the woods for him . I 'll get my gun . - ABBY : No . - Well , damn it . He is armed . No guns . Just bring him back . GREG : Come on . Hey , Barney ! Get out , boy . Quick . Just run . Don 't come back . Get away , quick ! They think you killed Wendy . They 're after you . No . Get as far as you possibly can . Please , please , just run . Run , Barney , run ! There he is . Barney . Barney ! ( SOFTLY ) Run , Barney . Run , boy . - Where is he ? - Paul 's bringing him . - He had this with him . - Oh , God . Oh , Barney didn 't do it , man . There 's no harm in Barney . GREG : Why did he run away then ? - He was pestering Wendy last night . - I wouldn 't call it that . The point is , what we going to do about it . I don 't know . Try him , I suppose . Try him ? Try Barney ? Wouldn 't " unfit to plead " be the legal phrase ? Well , fit or unfit , what do we do with him ? I mean , if we believe that he did it , what do we do with him ? We haven 't heard what he 's got to say yet . Sit down , Barney . Barney , why did you say I didn 't do it , when Greg and Mr Russell caught you this morning ? Well , I didn 't . Didn 't what ? Do that to Wendy . Barney , how did you know Wendy was dead ? Did Barney really do that to Wendy ? I don 't know . Barney wouldn 't hurt anyone . Come on , get on with your sums . - Maybe he didn 't know what he was doing . - He is a bit funny , isn 't he ? Come on . Otherwise , no stories . And this . Is this yours , Barney ? It 's got blood on it . Clean it . By it , what do you mean ? - It 's got blood on it . - Clean it . - What does he mean ? - I think he means he wants to clean it . - GREG : Or should have cleaned it . - Or almost anything . - Look , this is ridiculous . - ABBY : Please , we must do our best . Now , Barney , this arrow which belongs to you has got blood on it . Can you tell us how the blood got there ? Rabbit ! - Can we disprove that ? - No , and we can 't prove it either . - Is there no way ? - Yeah , if we had a forensic laboratory . Rabbit blood must be different to the other one . It stands to reason . It 's different all right , but it looks exactly the same to me . What are they doing to him ? - They 're just asking him questions . - What questions ? I don 't know . Barney , do you remember last night ? The party ? We had a party last night . Yeah . You were with Wendy . You were dancing with Wendy . Yeah ! Dance ! ABBY : Barney , did you go to Wendy 's room afterwards ? After the party ? Barney , what did you do when the party was over ? I was bad . Bad ? Sick . After you were sick , what did you do ? Sleeped . ( SIGHS ) Does anyone else want to ask him anything ? ARTHUR : There 's one question we haven 't asked . Did you kill Wendy ? No . What are they going to do with him ? Never you mind . You get on with what you are doing . Vic , you 're wanted in here . - Can we come , too ? - Come and see Barney ? - No . - You get on with your poems . - What have you done with him ? - PAUL : Nothing . He 's in his room . - Why can 't we go and see him ? - Because you ought to stay here . What do you think , Abby ? ABBY : I don 't know . You know , I 'll tell you , we don 't know any more now than what we did when we started . Anybody it could have been . It could have been anybody . Well , I 'm sorry , but it seems obvious to me that he did it . Look , in the first place , he was chasing Wendy all over the shop last night . - No ! - No , he was enjoying himself . - That 's all . Wendy didn 't seem to mind . - All right , all right . Well , let 's just say that he was attentive . In the second place , when he saw us this morning , he ran away as fast as he could . And thirdly , when we caught up with him , he said , " I didn 't kill her . " No , he didn 't . He said , " I didn 't do it . " Look , Jenny , I was there . I know perfectly well what he said . He said , " I didn 't kill her . " Paul ? When I said , " Who ? " , he said , " Wendy . " How the hell did he know who or what I was talking about unless he had killed her . In the fourth place , he 's got a weapon and it could be the weapon and it 's got blood on it . Now , I know all that 's circumstantial , but I think it 's enough . I don 't believe it . I don 't believe the boy did it ! - My instinct tells me . - Yeah , well , what more would you like ? A lot . Now you say he ran away when he saw you this morning . Well , is it surprising in someone of his mentality , when he sees four hulky great men running towards him ? And then he said , " I didn 't do it , " or " I didn 't kill her , " or something like that . Again , isn 't it exactly what someone of his mentality would say when they were caught . I mean , he must have known they were not just calling him in to breakfast . ( GASPS ) And your point about the arrow . Well , if you could prove to me that it is human blood , then ... - CHARMIAN : I believed him . - Yeah , but you believed what ? When Arthur asked him outright , did he kill Wendy , and he said no , I think he was telling the truth . - Yes . - But you see , I think he just doesn 't remember . Or didn 't know what he was doing . Then he is not guilty . Yes , he is guilty but with diminished responsibility . Question is , what do we do anyway if we do find him guilty ? Now , I 've been thinking about this . Surely we shouldn 't consider that until we 've decided whether he 's guilty or not . PAUL : Why not ? Because if we do decide , it might sway our verdict . I think Arthur 's right . We shouldn 't decide what to do about it until we 've reached a verdict . It 's down here . It 's this one . It 's locked . Barney , are you there ? Barney , can we come in ? BARNEY : Lizzie . Look . The key . I think we 've talked enough . How can you talk enough with this at stake ? No , no , no . Abby 's right . Look , all we 're doing is just going over the same ground again and again . What do we do now then ? We vote . Guilty or not guilty . ( SIGHS ) Greg ? Guilty . Arthur ? Guilty . - Emma ? - Not guilty . - Jenny ? - Not guilty . - Charmian ? - Guilty . - Tom ? - Not guilty . - Paul ? - Guilty . ABBY : Vic ? It 's got to be guilty . That 's five guilty and three not guilty . GREG : No , it isn 't . You haven 't voted . Guilty . And now what ? ABBY : You mean , what do we do with him ? Banish him from the community . - PAUL : Just turn him loose ? - Yes . What if he comes back ? We gotta think of the kids . He won 't come back . - PAUL : How can anyone be sure ? - Not if we take him far enough away . That 's not right ! That 's not human ! He can 't look after himself . He will die ! - How did he get by until now ? - How many people has he killed ? - Oh , that 's ridiculous ! - Well , is it ? Well , are you prepared to take the risk of Lizzie and John ? - Well , are you ? - No , of course not . - But couldn 't we just ... - Well , go on . Couldn 't we just what ? Well , we could watch them . We could keep them apart . Yeah , for 24 hours a day . And who 's gonna do it ? I don 't know . Seems to me that we have no choice . ABBY : What ? Capital punishment . Punishment for what , for God 's sake ? The man 's a mental defective . Exactly . So , we should send him to a hospital , where he 'd be looked after for his own and everyone else 's good . Well , the only question is , which hospital ? You can 't kill him . You can 't kill Barney . Well , do you think I want to ? I 'd just like one of you to suggest a viable alternative . Well , come on ! Come on , what are we going to do with him ? Lock him up ? Just lock him up and let him rot ? No . No , not that . GREG : All right , then what ? But you can 't kill him . You can 't do that ! No , we take him somewhere and let him ... Die slowly or kill someone else or both . The easy way out , hmm ? We don 't see him die and we don 't see him kill anyone . Out of sight and out of mind . - You all make me sick . - ABBY : Greg . GREG : Come on , we gotta face facts ! Look , society 's got a bit compressed lately , or had none of you noticed ? We can 't pass the buck any more . We can 't offload this on the police , law courts , government hospitals , or anyone else . We 've got to think and feel and act for ourselves . Greg 's right . It 's a desperate situation , but we 've got to face up to it . We 've got to decide and there can be no shirking . Arthur 's right , too . There 's no question of punishment . But could we forgive ourselves if we did nothing and something happened to John and Lizzie ? We 've got to protect ourselves . That 's what we 've got to think about . Look , you have no right to tell us what to think . - I know that , Emma . - We can 't kill him ! And we can 't lock him up either . It 's not only inhuman , it 's not possible . If we 're going to get through next winter , - we need every hand that we 've got . - You are telling us what to think ! ABBY : No , I 'm not . I 'm telling you what to think about . Now , look , we 've got a sick animal , we either put it down or we abandon it . Now , that 's what you think about . That 's what we all think about hard . ( SIGHS ) Listen , I suggest we stop this and we have lunch . Who wants lunch ? The children want lunch , Emma . They had no breakfast . ( LIZZIE HUMMING ) ( CHUCKLING ) Barney , do you know anything about dinosaurs ? - Of course he doesn 't , silly . - It 's not silly . I know a lot about them and he 's bigger than I am . Breakfast ? JOHN : The biggest was the Tyrannosaurus rex . And he was carnivorous . Do you know what that means ? I think he wants some breakfast . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) - Out ! - I think Barney 's hungry . - He hasn 't had any breakfast . - Out ! I 'm hungry . Yeah . Well , it 's lunch time . I 'll bring you something . ( STAMMERING ) When I go to the sheep ? When you 've had your lunch . ( LOCK CLICKING ) ( HUMMING ) Can I have some more , please ? Why is everybody so grumpy ? Eat your lunch , please . GREG : Now , can we get it over with , please ? Where are they ? They 're playing in the courtyard . They 're all right . Yes . Well , we 'll vote for one thing or the other . There 's no alternative . - Greg ? - Death . - We have no choice . - ABBY : No comments , please . ABBY : Tom ? I can 't . - Come on ! - All right , banishment then . ABBY : Arthur ? Death . - Charmian ? - Banishment . - Paul ? - PAUL : We have to ... Just your vote . Death . - ABBY : Emma ? - Banish ! - ABBY : Jenny ? - Me , too . - ABBY : Banishment ? - Yes . Vic ? Death . Four and four . GREG : Which leaves you with the casting vote . ( CRYING ) In the morning , Jenny can take the children fishing . If we 're gonna do it , we do it now . All right . Right . Who 's going first ? I 'll go first . There 's no need for you to take one , Price . ( GASPING ) ( ARTHUR GRUNTING ) ( ARTHUR GROANING ) - LIZZIE : Oh ! - Catch it . No . Not what I was intending . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) LIZZIE : Come on ! ( GUN FIRES ) ( WHIMPERS ) ( SOBBING ) - ABBY : Greg ? - Not now . Greg . ( TOM CRYING ) - It still comes back to me . - Greg , we 're all just as responsible . Yeah , well , we didn 't all pull the trigger . You were carrying out a collective decision . Look , if I 'd voted the other way , then ... ( EXHALES ) I still think others should be told about Price . - I don 't see what good that 's gonna do . - That 's not the point . It 's the whole point . We 're fighting for survival not principles . They have a right to know . Abby , you 're the figurehead here . Whether you like it or not , people are always going to look up to you for a lead . But I 'm the manager . I run things . And I 'm warning you that if you insist on telling them , then I 'm gonna challenge you . And if that happens , then what we 've got here is just gonna fall apart . I don 't think I can bear to have him near me . Well , do you think I can ? I 'd have killed him if you hadn 't stopped me . And if you insist on telling the others , there 's gonna be none of this business of drawing straws . He 'll be lynched . The unpleasant truth is that we need Price . We were overworked before even when we had Wendy and Barney . Without Price , well , there 's no future here . So , what happens the next time he gets drunk . He 'll never drink again . All he 's gonna do is work . Just keep him away from me . ( SOBBING ) I 'm sorry . Forgive me . Please forgive me . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Please forgive me .

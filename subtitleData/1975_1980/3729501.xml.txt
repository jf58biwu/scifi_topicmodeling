 - I did too . The old man can still beat him . - Come on , Dad . You saw it , didn 't ya ? Close , really close . - All right . If it was close , let 's go again . - How many times do I have to beat you ? - You beat me ? - Yeah , I beat you . - All right ! You won ! - Hey , leave your father alone . All this exercise is making me hungry . - Come on , Dad . All right , you won . - No , no . - You won . - No , you won . - No , no , you won . - No , you won . Mr. Childress , telephone for you , sir ... on the terrace . Better get here as soon as you can . I 'll tell Peter . What 'll living in the States be like , Dad ? I don 't know . We ´ ve been away a long time . - Yeah , It 's been since Mom died . - Yeah . - Hey , why Chicago ? - Good school for ya . The best . - You could go out for football . - What , give up soccer ? Well , footballs more popular in the States . Football players are more popular with the girls . Dad ... I don 't know , school and sports , all that stu ... I just won 't fit in there . I feel like a freak . - What is this ? - Maybe if I knew what was wrong with me ... There 's nothing wrong with you . - I might do OK in a zoo . - What the hell are you doing ? Feeling sorry for yourself ? OK , you have a talent that would shock the hell out of people . But It 's a talent that also can be put to good use . It ´ s nothin ´ to be ashamed of . Childress understands this . That 's why he wants you to go to this school in Chicago . You 'll meet other kids that are special , like you . Robin ... I 'll be with you . All the way . If it doesn 't work out , we 'll do something else . Robin ... do me a favour . I wanna talk to your father alone . One minute . - Sure . I 'll be on the terrace , Dad . - OK . Peter , you 've gotta give me the telephone number of that dame from the antique shop . There 's nothing antique about her . Everything works . - Gonna miss you . - Well , I 'm not gonna miss you . 20 years together in the same agency is more than enough . Well , you taught me a lot . You did . If this is a teary farewell , get outta here . No tears . All laughs . Say goodbye to your son alone . Waiter . Regular luncheon for two . My dad ! Get Robin outta here ! - Dad ! - Your fathers all right . He ´ s a professional . - They 're after my dad ! - They ´ re after all of us . For Christ 's sakes ... Dad ! They killed my dad ! Oh , son , I 'm sorry . They killed my dad ! Robertson , where the hell are ya ? Gimme the gun ! I 'll find out who broke security . - I 'll ... - No ! Get this boy outta here . - Come on , Robin , move . Into the car . - It 'll be all right , Robin . - I 'm sorry , sir . - It ´ s all right , Jonathan . Good job . - I 'm proud of you . Go by the road . - Thank you . Sure . give me the film . It 's already 87 degrees this morning ... I said ´ Mother , what do you want from me ? " ´ ´ You got this terrific job . you ´ re all over the world . " ´ I get to see her once a month , if I 'm lucky . 'I ´ m happy for you . I really am . " ´ But I said ´ Just don ´ t try and run my life when you happen to be around the house for a few days and feel like playing Mom . ´ I know . They just don 't know how to let go . And they get so hurt when you try to explain . Really . Anyway , let 's see if you know this junk . January 10th , 1946 . That was the first United Nations General Assembly - that was held in London . Right ? - Good . - See , I told you . I never forget dates . - All right ... Who was elected president of the assembly ? It 's names I have trouble with . - LaRue , don 't tell me . - I didn ´ t say anything . - Yes , you did . You said ´ Raymond " ´ .. - I did not . " ´ Raymond " ´ ? His name wasn 't Raymond . It was ... Raymond Dunwoodie . Who was Raymond Dunwoodie ? I don 't know . It ´ s just ... that name just came into my head . I don ´ t know . - So what was the real answer ? - Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium . Oh , yes ! - Paul-Henri Spaak . I always get that wrong . - OK , next . The five permanent members of the UN Security Council are ... The United States , Russia ... I know . let 's just forget the whole thing . - Forget it ? Are you crazy ? - LaRue , I know this stu . - We have a final at two o 'clock . - And I ´ m gonna pass with flying colours . Hey , guess what . We got a buddy . Oh , my God . What a creep . He 's walking backwards now . - Should we give him money ? - No ! God , what do you take me for ? I don 't know . Oh , He ´ s not gonna bother us . - I hope we pass . - Sure ! Two popcorns , please . - Hello ? - Mr. Johnson ? - Yes . - It 's Raymond Dunwoodie . - What is it , Raymond ? - Now , look , I haven 't changed my mind . There 's nothing I can do for you personally , but I may have somebody to locate your son . You 'd better not be wasting my time . No , look , I 'm at the beach , and I made a contact . She 's a kid , maybe 17 , and She ´ s psychic . - Are you sure ? - That 's right , She ´ s psychic . Bring her here . I don 't have her yet , but I could get her . Now , look ... Mr. Johnson , this is gonna cost . How much ? I don 't mean 50 or 100 bucks , not for this girl . - How much , Raymond ? - $ 1,000 . I don 't have that kind of money . That 's a sad story , Mr. J. Almost as sad as the story you told me about your boy . Dunwoodie paid o . We 've completed the trace . He 's talking to Sandza at the Plymouth Hotel . - Step inside , o the street . - Yes , sir . - Is this man registered here ? - I don 't know . - I just came on a half-hour ago myself . - We think He 's been here a few days . You ain 't the police , is ya ? Well ... I 'm what you ´ d consider well-travelled , but I 've never heard of you gentlemen . We don 't spend a dime on public relations . Yeah , well ... That would be Mr. RV Johnson . Room 512 . Just down the hall to your left . Hey , government man. don 't bust my door down , please . Use a passkey . Chase One to Chase Two . He 's loose . Do you copy ? He 's loose . Do you copy ? Chase One to Chase Two . He 's loose . Do you copy ? Gunmen of the Hanafi Muslim sect continue their siege of three Washington buildings ... Goddammit ! did you hear that , Vivian ? Now That 's what I ´ m talkin ´ about . Them bozos in Washington are mugging the whole damn country . Every court in the land is makin it legal . If you asked me what happened to the milk of human kindness , I 'd have to tell you frankly that the whole world has dried up at the tit . You can say that again . I swear to hell I don 't know ... - Vivian ! - Yes , Mother Nuckells , I 'm coming . Couldn 't you just once manage to go potty by yourself ? - Vivian , somebodys in my room ! - Oh , sure . All right , now . Nobody 's gonna get hurt . - I just want some clothes . - He came in my window . Do you know who he is ? I told you we should have moved to Melrose Park . This wouldn 't be happening if we lived in Melrose Park . You want clothes ? Old clothes , anything you 've got . Well , you can see I need clothes . I can 't go anywhere like this . - Just the clothes ? - Yes . I had to leave the hotel in a hurry , so could you spare a couple of dollars ? Could do . This is a graphic example of biofeedback . Were converting the very low-voltage alpha-wave energy into electricity to run that train . And that train will only run when my friend Hester is in alpha . Now , as you may have hoped , there are more practical applications to biofeedback training . If you can regulate your brain waves , you can control your heart rate , blood pressure , headaches , backaches , even , ladies , cold feet . I work at the Paragon Institute , where we study the phenomena of extrasensory perception . And we are using biofeedback techniques to tap the almost Limitless resources of the human mind . And I am speaking now of such things as thought transmissions , commonly known as telepathy . Now , that machine is called a magnetometer , and it records the fluctuations of the human electromagnetic field during our experiments , and I guess Hester 's had it . Thank you , Hester . I wanna stress that no particular talent is needed to achieve this . Anybody can achieve alpha ... with a little patience . Wanna try ? Sure . Try to remember that ´ alpha " ´ is another word for " ´ passive " ´ .. Right . Visualise sitting in an empty theatre in front of a blank screen . And let that screen fill your mind . OK . - What is she doing ? - I have no idea . don 't mind about them . It ´ s OK . Are you all right ? Creep . I 'd say I ´ m pretty sound , considering the ravages of time . For instance , I don 't have the use of any more than one of my limbs or vital organs . Good thing the Lord God Jehovah built in so many spare parts . - But when the old ticker gives out , That 's it . - Ain ´ t that the truth ? - How long do you think You 'll be staying ? - Shut up , Vivian . - Let the boy enjoy his breakfast . - Thank you . - What is it they want you for ? - I 'm a high-level security risk . did you get it yet ? - No . - It 's been over two months . Would you shut up , Betsy ? It does not ! I mean ... - Gillian , I was saving that seat for Cheryl . - Too bad . - Cheryl can sit over here . - Oh , God . Cheryl , I 'm sorry . I tried to save a seat for you , but Gillian just took it . - Look , have my seat ... - Hey , watch it . Good Lord , Pam . If you 're that nervous , why don ´ t you masturbate ? Are you ready for tomorrow ? You two are so sweet . When are you getting married ? See any ghosts today , Gillian ? - Cheryl , you 're not very funny . - Gillian ´ s not very funny . There are more mature ways to get attention , don 't you think , Gillian ? - Have you seen Mr. Wadkins new girlfriend ? - Yeah , where ´ d he pick that ticket ? Read my mind . - What ? - Tell me what I 'm thinking . Come on , right now . Read my mind . That 's what they say you can do . No , I don 't know how to read minds , Cheryl . It ´ s ridiculous . - Cheryl , just ... - Shut up , LaRue . I only wanna find something out . That 's all . All right , come on . Oh , great . Now pay attention , everybody . Gillians gonna perform . I didn 't say I ´ d ... Cheryl , I don 't know anything about reading minds , all right ? I mean , I don 't even know what I ´ m thinkin ´ most of the time , so ... get o my back . - Gillian , you 're so full of shit . - Cheryl , you ´ re an asshole . Just shut up . She can 't help being upset . She has to take it out on someone . What did you say ? You don 't want everyone to know that you ´ re pregnant ? What ? I would like for you to explain that little remark . - Just what do you think you know about me ? - I 'm sorry , I didn ´ t ... - Tell me ! - Let go , Cheryl . Let go . - Tell me ! - Please let go . - Cheryl ! - Tell me ! No ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Help me ! I put some cookies in a bag for you . - You might get hungry later on . - Thank you . how 's your hair ? Dry yet ? Oh , It 's fine . - Hey ! - Oh , just fine . That Shinola will wash right out . I 'd appreciate it if you ´ d wait till after M * A * S * H to let them go . M * A * S * H ? I 'll wait till Sunrise Semester . Might as well just leave 'em there . They ain ´ t got anything to say I wanna hear . I 've heard it all before . Peter ? That 's your real name ? That 's right . can 't see a reason why you ´ d make up lies to tell me . - I don 't matter , anyhow . - I wouldn ´ t lie to you , Mother Nuckells . You know that . Then I hope you find your son . If He 's alive ... I 'll find him . And if the Feds get in your way , shoot 'em . Just shoot ´ em . It ´ s all they deserve . There 's so many of them . They just keep coming . Kill 'em ! Kill ´ em ! Now don 't overwork yourself , Mother Nuckells . It ´ s bad for the old ticker . Thank you . Would you let us outta here now ? No ? - Please ! - Get us outta here , do you hear ? let 's go check that out . - That 's all the way down . - OK , man , I dig . - Hey , man . Check out Pops . - let 's see what the old man got in the bag . Watch One to Top Guy One . Visual and clear . Do you copy ? - OK , let 's have the bag . - He ´ s got a gun . Come on , I wanna go home . - Home with you ? - With me , yeah . I 'll never go home with you . Come on . - I don 't wanna go home . - you ´ re gonna go home right now . Hey , how 's that for a horn ? But listen to that stereo . You ever heard better fuckin stereo sound in your life ? How can you be sure It 's Sandza ? He had to be in the neighborhood . All we had to do was wait . I trained with him . I know his style . What 's he doing now ? Over . Looks like off-duty cops in that Cadillac ahead of us . There 's nothing he can do . - Can I help you , Pop ? - you 're under arrest . What ? you 're under arrest for impersonating police officers . Hey , hey , look out ! What the hell ... ? He 's got a piece . It ´ s in my armpit . All right ... what do you want me to do ? Drive down that alley . Fast . Crazy son of a bitch ! Take a right ! Faster ! Holy shit ! - Should I drive a little faster ? - No . Slower . Slower ? Right now you 're the only two people in the world I feel safe with . - I wanna enjoy your company . - Yeah , OK , sure , sure . Why not ? We 'll just cruise around a little bit . Maybe after a while you 'll wanna talk . Yeah . What 's your name ? - Peter . - I 'm Marty O ´ Brien ... - Is that gun uncomfortable in your armpit ? - No , no . I want you to meet my partner , Officer Eggleston . Hi , Peter . Why don 't you call me Bob ? Hi , Bob . Nice car . Yeah , It 's brand-new . I just picked it up about a half-hour ago . - I wouldn 't want anything to happen to it . - I don ´ t blame you . - Is that shoe polish in your hair , Peter ? - Yes , it is . It 's a disguise . - That 's a pretty clever disguise . - Yeah . It didn 't work , though . They were waiting for me . Must have been waiting all day . I gotta give that Childress a lot of credit , the son of a bitch . Somebodys after you , is that it ? What do you suppose He 's tellin ´ those cops ? Whatever it is , they won 't believe him . I worked for a government agency you never heard of . They took my son away from me . They needed him , so they just took him . Keep your hand in your lap , Marty . It 's a frightening power these people have . They can make anybody disappear any time . - Somebodys gotta stop ´ em . - Yeah , that ´ s right . If you don 't mind , maybe we can help . Yeah . You see , Marty and myself have had a lot of experience with ... - People like kickin people around . - Harassin ´ them . I got an idea . Why don 't we stop for some coffee ? don 't stop ! Get o this drive ! We ´ re like sitting ducks here ! Easy , man . Were on your side . We ´ re just tryin ´ to help . Chase One to Top Guy One . We 've got him on the Lower Drive . Copy ? Copy . Were right above you . Two sedans have been following us , standard government issue . - He 's right about that ... - Bob ! - I want you to lose those cars . - Lose ? How do you suppose I ... ? There 's a construction site over the bridge . When we get there , I want you to follow my instructions exactly , understand ? Bob , if they can make me disappear , they can make you disappear too . Chase cars , pull up alongside the Cadillac . let 's find out what Peter has in mind . Something 's goin ´ on here . Do they look like Feds to you ? Who knows ? Peter , I 'm worried about that gun goin ´ o by accident if we hit a bump . - Got something to worry about . - Across the bridge when the light changes ? Were not gonna wait for the lights to change , Bob . Were not ? Go ! Oh , God , please , God , don 't let anything happen to my new car . Chase One to Top Guy One . He 's crossing bridge into fog . Losing visual contact . They 're finished . Let ´ s go home . That son of a bitch ! - Hey , watch where you 're goin ´ .. - I can ´ t see anything in this soup . - Which way ? - I don 't know . - You go straight and I 'll go left . - All right . - Now what ? - Dunno . Hear anything ? I don 't know . Do you ? Yeah , I definitely hear something . Chase One , were in pursuit of the Caddy ! I see him . I see him . He 's over there , around to the right . - Jesus ! - How the hell was I ... ? There they are . Go on , get movin ! All right , get out . Both of you ! Leave the motor running . - I can 't believe it . Not a scratch ! - Throw your pieces in the lake . What are you gonna do now , Peter ? If you see Childress , ask him if it was worth his arm . What happened to his arm , Peter ? I killed it with a machine gun . - Hey , Peter , now wait ... - Tell Childress to follow me ! I want him to follow me this time ! Not in my car , man . - Watch out , Bob ! - Peter , let 's talk about this ! Gillian , I know you 're upset , but It ´ s silly . I was told Cheryl has a history of nosebleeds . An ice bag stopped the bleeding . But what I 'm trying to tell you is : I made it happen . - That 's Impossible . - What about when you started bleeding ? A couple of weeks ago ? You said the cut was healed , and it opened right up. don 't ! Why not ? Cos it could happen to you . Gillian , I 've had a long flight and I ´ m very tired . - I want you to stop carrying on like this . - don 't be mad at me . Sweetheart , I 'm not . I always thought we could tell each other anything , no matter what . We can . Mother , I love you . I 'm afraid . - Afraid to let me touch you ? - Yes . Honey , I 'm home and I 'll stay here just as long as you need me , I promise . But what we really should do now is talk to someone . And Steve Brenneman has had wonderful success ... I 'm not going to a psychiatrist . Hello ? Oh , It 's you . That was a good one . Really passionate . I need ... Listen , I 'm a nurse . And if my phones tied up and they can ´ t get hold of me ... So maybe you could breathe for someone else tonight . I need ... I need your body , baby . Come on , baby , It 's me . Oh , my God ! Why do we always have to meet in this van ? Couldn 't we go to my place , just this once ? Too dangerous . Well , for the sake of argument , let 's assume that everybody at the institute has their phones tapped . - Nobody 's watching me , for heaven ´ s sakes . - They ´ re always watching . Raymond Dunwoodie was a psychic . If he 'd had enough time , he ´ d have found Robin . But Childress was watching him . How else do you think they got to me ? Why are you so afraid of this guy ? I 'm not afraid of Childress . He ´ s afraid of me . He knows I 'll get my son back . Now what about those files ? I 'm nobody . I just work there . I don ´ t have access to any vital secrets . You mean you didn 't get a chance to examine the files at Paragon ? - Yes , I did . - And ? Robin is ... - Well , He 's ... - Dead . - According to the records ... - Of course That 's what they say . - Childress keeps the records . - What if It 's true ? Hester , look at me . I 'm proof . Proof that my son is alive , else why would Childress be so anxious to put me away ? They 've got him somewhere . you 're the only one who can help me . How long did you follow me around before taking a chance on me ? Too long . Thanks . Thanks for pickin me . Hester , you don 't realise how beautiful you really are . Somewhere They 're doin ´ a hell of a lot of research ... much more complicated than Paragon . God only knows what They 're doing to my son . Peter , if Robin is still ... I promise I 'll do everything I can to help find Robin . But you take too much for granted . You trust too many people . Paragon Institute . It sounds like a haven for quacks . - But their references are good . - It 's right up there on the left . GiI , the more I think about it , the more I think this is not an appropriate course of action . Mother , I like Dr Lindstrom . Anyway , I 'm old enough to know what I ´ m doing . Well , I don 't intend to let you stay here until they ´ ve answered a lot of questions . - And I mean that , Gillian . - OK . - Hi , Gillian . - Hi . - Mrs. Bellaver , I 'm Ellen Lindstrom . - How do you do ? - Please come in . - Thank you . Dr McKeever is busy monitoring a test , but he should be with us shortly . - Maybe You 'd like to look around . - Thank you . I 've been here before . - This was Babe Giords house . - Yes , we bought the house from the Giords . It was so beautifully furnished , we tried to make as few alterations as possible . In fact , Gillians suite is particularly attractive . - I don 't know why you want Gillian to stay ... - That was my idea , Mrs. Bellaver . Gillian and Katherine Bellaver , this is our director , Jim McKeever . How do you do ? - Gillian . - Hi . Young people stay with us all the time while they help with our evaluation programme . Thanks , Ellie . We can do a better job of judging psychic ability if There 's a minimum of distractions . Of course , It 's not all work and no play . There 's a good library right here and a game room down the hall . - Do you play backgammon , Gillian ? - Yeah . Good . And our housekeeper is the best Irish cook in Chicago , I 'm sorry to say . I 'd like to know what kind of programme you ´ re talking about . Certainly . Why don 't we look at one of our workshops ? Telepathy is a timeless form of communication . Now my five-year-old daughter was very good at this . But the older and more sophisticated we become , the more we rationalise what our senses try to tell us . This is all Gillian will be doing ? Yes , this and similar tests , under my personal supervision . We 'll take good care of her , Mrs. Bellaver . I 'll be fine. don ´ t worry . I 'll see you in a couple of weeks , OK ? All right , but I 'll call you when I get to Paris . - You know where I 'm staying if you ... - Yes , Mother . I 'll be fine . Goodbye . - Goodbye . - Goodbye , Mrs. Bellaver . - Nice meeting you . - Have a good trip . Oh , my God ! It 's beautiful . Do you like it ? Look at this . It 's great . I 'll start unpacking . Look around , make yourself comfortable . This is beautiful . - ´ Paragon . " ´ The best there is , right ? - Something that can ´ t be equalled . Like the incredible power of the human mind . We hope you learn to use that power to develop your gift . It 's not a gift . It ´ s more like having a bad tooth and never knowing when It ´ s gonna hurt . That 's because a part of the mind you ´ ve never used before becomes sensitised . - Sensitised to what ? - The bioplasmic universe . Come again ? The bioplasmic universe . In that universe is a record of every human impulse , word and deed . Of lives past and lives to come . Occasionally you make a connection between the timeless world and the physical world . You have what clairvoyants call ´ a vision " ´ .. But It 's never about me , though . I never see anything about me . Guess I 'm glad I don ´ t . I 've been thinking . We should have a little treat . - Just for ourselves . - What ? Hot fudge sundaes , vanilla and chocolate ice cream . - Hester ... - Bananas , maraschino cherries , coconut , strawberry topping , - whipped cream all over the top . - No , stop . Oh , my God . You guys . If I don 't finish these tests soon , I 'll be so fat , you 'll have to roll me outta here . - Well , have fun . - Thanks . Come on. you 've earned it . you 're right . What the hell . Besides , what are you talkin about ? You look terrific . - Not after this . - Do you have a boyfriend ? No , no one special . What about you ? Pretty slim pickings around here . - Yeah , Paragon is just a job . - Well , do you have a boyfriend ? - Have I got a boyfriend ! - What 's he like ? Well , He 's very charming . Swept me right o my feet . - In the park . - In the park ? - Yeah , he picked me up in the park . - What was his line ? He said he needed help . Some line . - What are you talkin about ? It worked . - True . What does he do ? Do ? Well , he travels around a lot . Where ? Well ... all over . When he comes to town , we go to parties . He loves people . He takes me out dancing , buys me presents ... He dresses beautifully , and He 's a good dancer . The only trouble is ... He 's very hard to get hold of . Come on. let 's dig in . You mean gross out . Look at this . When I was your age , I had one great ambition . - To be Fred Astaire . - Oh , my God . As you can see , I failed miserably . I took dance for a couple of years . My mother insisted . You see , she didn 't think I was any too graceful ... don 't touch me anymore . Please don 't touch me . Oh , God ! God ! What happened ? Tomorrow we do real tests , make things as challenging as possible for Gillian . Nelson , as soon as Gillian begins to show her psychometric talents , I want complete audio and videotape records of the tests . - Will she be working in the Faraday cage ? - No , this girls no cheat . She ´ s the real thing . Now ... Do we have any bleeders in the group ? No . Anyone who 's had even minor surgery in the past three months ? How about ulcers ? Hester , Kristen , Lorraine ... If you 're into your monthlies , I don ´ t want you around during testing . - Are you serious ? - I 'm very serious . Gillians power to psychometrise is spontaneous . She creates an enormously powerful electromagnetic field . Almost everyone exposed to it will bleed . Some will bleed a little , some a lot . What is this kid ? A vampire ? You wanna continue working here ? Then I don 't wanna hear any more funny remarks like that . - How do you account for it ? - We can 't . Not yet . Gillian ... can you hear me ? It takes a while for the EvipaI to take effect . Ellie , please . Gillian ... what did you see on the stairs ? A boy . Robin . Have you seen him before ? Yeah . I have . Gillian and Robin were in touch telepathically . Think what we could do if Robin were alive . - I 'm sending her home . - Jim ... - Why ? - I don 't wanna be responsible for Gillian . - I don 't think you mean that . - I don ´ t wanna talk about it anymore ! It 's late . And were both overexcited . Listen , I don 't understand something . This is a marvellous opportunity for us . We only had Robin for a few days , but I think that Gillian really wants to work with us and she is the best subject for psychic research I have ever seen . Ellie ... even the most backward tribes , the most primitive cultures on Earth , would welcome the birth of a Robin Sandza . And in time he 'd become their magician , their prophet , their great healer . There is no place for these kids in our culture . They 're superior to what we hold sacred . And what a culture can 't assimilate ... it destroys . Jim , what really happened to Robin Sandza ? He was running on the steps , takin them two or three at a time . He ... slipped and went through the window . - But why was he running ? - I don 't know , Ellie . I wasn ´ t here . Jim ... Why don 't you come up to my place ? - I mean , I 'll scramble some eggs ... - No , I ´ m ... I 'm gonna finish this . Then I 'm gonna stretch out on the couch for a couple of hours . What time is it ? My watch has stopped . It 's a quarter after four . Excuse me . It 's later than I thought . Thanks , Ellie . Well ... Good night , Jim . Good morning . What do you want ? My arm hurts . It 's dead . Why should it still hurt ? you 're the brain expert . So tell me . Is it all in my head , Doctor ? It 's an oversimplification , but there ´ s nothing I can do . That 's not why I came here . Tell me about Gillian Bellaver . My people always know What 's going on here , even if you 're slow to keep me informed . Will the girl be another Robin Sandza ? - No . - Really ? Poor Peter . If he only knew that Robin doesn 't care anymore , doesn 't care if his father ´ s alive or dead . - What the hell have you done to that boy ? - He 's being treated like a prince . He is . He 's royalty , unique . The Chinese don ´ t have one , the Soviets don ´ t have one . In all the world , There 's no one quite like Robin Sandza ... unless It ´ s this girl . How can you hold him against his will and get any kind of results ? Against his will ? You don 't understand Robin ´ s needs . We do . Are you testing the girl today ? She 's failed every test . She ´ s a fake . I ´ m sending her home . - I don 't have time to waste on people ... - don ´ t do that to me , Doctor . don 't ever try Lying to me . For God 's sakes , She ´ s just a child . She doesn ´ t know anything . She has no control over what She 's doing . Robin had no control when he came here . Just raw ability . Doctor ... I wish you could see him now . For God 's sakes . I want you to get yourself together , stop fudging your responsibilities . This girl is important to me . I 'm assigning extra security . Why ? If I know Peter , he penetrated your security weeks ago . He probably knows I have Gillian Bellaver . I don 't know who his confederate is ... but I 'm looking into it . - She 's all right . - Try that one . I will , I will . Kristen , where 's Dr McKeever ? He 's checking out the new testing equipment . - Do you know when he 'll be back ? - He said not before dinner . - Where 's Gillian ? - Having breakfast . I could use a cup of coffee myself . A club ... Good morning , Gillian . you 're not eating much . I 'm not very hungry . did you hear what happened yesterday ? Dr mckeevers hand started bleeding . Yes , I do know about that . Well , what are you gonna do about it ? I mean , It 's why I ´ m here , isn ´ t it ? can 't anybody help me ? Gillian , we have to work together . Gillian . Do you remember much of what we talked about last night ? Last night ? - Were you here last night , Dr Lindstrom ? - That 's all right . While you were with Dr McKeever , you had a vision that upset you . You were in a fugue state for a while . We gave you something to help you relax and I suggested that you consciously forget whatever was troubling you . And apparently ... it worked better than I thought . So you don 't remember anything about Robin Sandza ? No . Who 's Robin Sandza ? He 's a boy your age ... with powers like yours . Like me ? Well , where is he ? I mean , do you think I could talk to him ? Do you know him ? I feel like I do . What can you tell me about him ? He 's ... He 's not very clear . He ´ s ...

Disturbance of the magnetic field on the last PK .

I need to talk to my mother . Do you think I could call my mother ? You can talk to your mom in a little while , but you 've had a shock and you need to rest . - Here . - What is that ? It 's a sedative . It ´ s like aspirin . You take aspirin , don ´ t you ? Here 's some water . Drink plenty of water . That 's a good girl . I need to see Dr McKeever . I have to know what happened to Ellen . He 'll be here in a little while . I 'll stay here with you . Just lie down and relax . No . No , I gotta get outta here . I gotta go home . It 's all right , Gillian . Everything will be all right . we 'll take good care of you. don ´ t worry . Ellen 's x-rays were encouraging . She ´ s beginning to show signs of consciousness . - It had to be a cerebral haemorrhage ... - ´ She ´ s a fake . " ´ You were gonna send her home . Is that the kind of cooperation I can expect , Doctor ? I want Gillian Bellaver at the PSI facility tomorrow . Do we let her mother know ? She 's wealthy , with powerful friends . Gillian can ´ t just dis ... Peter , It 's Impossible . I 'll never be able to get that girl out of that place . I 'll blow it . Getting out of Paragon is a hell of a lot easier than getting in . - What do I say to Gillian ? - Tell her everything . Tell her what they did to Robin . They 'll do the same thing to her . - What if she won 't listen ? - I don ´ t have much time . That girl can lead me to Robin . - She was doped the last time I saw her . - Everything 's set for tomorrow . Tomorrow ? I need your help . Please . You feel all right , Robin ? You know , that wasn 't a very smart thing to do . You could have been very badly hurt . Why were you running away ? You didn 't have to use the window . There is a door . Yeah , like they 'd really let me just walk out the door . Why didn 't you come to me ? Because you 're one of them . I just wanna get outta here . I hate this place . I hate these doctors and the tests . They 're driving me crazy . I can ´ t even sleep . And you want to get away from me , too . Is that it ? - What do you care ? - Well , I care very much . What 's the matter , Robin ? don ´ t you trust me anymore ? I don 't know . But you do want to get out of here , don 't you ? Yeah . All right . Then we 'll go together . - Go where ? - Gillian ! Well , I have this place in the country , north of Chicago , in Lakeview . Gillian ? You can do whatever you like . You don 't have to see anybody , or talk to anybody . Not even me . Really ? Yes , really . Would you like to do that ? Sure . Gillian ? Gillian ? Hi , Hester . I 've been lookin ´ everywhere for you . This was Robins room when he was here . Yes , it was . He 's in terrible trouble now . Those people , they should be trying to help him . What people ? Where Robin is . They won 't leave him alone . I mean , it was like they were deliberately trying to hurt him . - Hester , don 't ! - Please , please , It ´ s OK . It 's OK . I 'm not bleeding . - You know where Robin is ? - Yeah , I do . Would you like to see him ? I need to see him . Well , I think we can work that out . How ? Dr McKeever says I 'm supposed to give these to you to keep you happy and harmless . - Do you know what I mean ? - No . What ... ? You 'll have to pretend you took them because I have to get you out of here tomorrow . - Otherwise you could be in trouble yourself . - What are you saying ? What is going on ? Oh , honey , I 've got so much to tell you . Would you like a drink ? You look tired . I am tired . how 's our Boy Wonder ? Those films have unleashed an incredible emotional force . He 's developing the power of an atomic reactor . - Or an atomic bomb . - What are you giving him to calm him down ? Every day he has 3000mg of phenobarbital and 1000mg of Prolixin . On trial days we ... What ? That 's enough to kill him . Drugs no longer have any effect on him . We 've pushed him too far . He ´ s quite unstable . - He flies into rages over nothing . - He could be dangerous . - What 's he trying to prove ? - Mentally , Robin has developed this perfect psychotronic relationship with all kinds of machines . And so naturally He 's trying to do the same thing now with his body . Except that physically , He 's just ... adequate . And when he fails ... He 's intolerable . How is he performing in bed ? Robin wants to please me . That 's the main thing , isn ´ t it ? He needs a rest . No more tests for at least a month . Sorry . He 's been under tremendous pressure . We plan to get away , just the two of us . No . We almost lost him once , Susan . I promised . I promised him wed get away , together . All right . Take him into the city , show him the sights , but get him back here in 24 hours . Well , there you are . Who are they ? these are friends of mine from the institute . Are you planning on seeing them later ? No , Robin . I 'm with you . Remember ? Which one are you gonna screw first ? Robin , come here . - Get away from me ! - Robin , please . Oh , my God ! Top Guy Two , this is Top Guy One . Do you have any coffee left ? Top Guy One , That 's an affirmative . I 've got about a cup of lukewarm coffee left . You wanna negotiate a trade ? Top Guy Two , I have one Hershey bar to trade . Top Guy One , I read you . Is that with or without almonds ? All right , Asshole One and Asshole Two , stop cluttering up this frequency . Isn 't Dr McKeever back yet ? I 'm afraid not , Hester . He ´ s still at the hospital with Ellen . Can I help ? Dr McKeever prescribed medication for Gillian this morning , but were all out of it . He was very specific about using a nonbarbiturate . - So I guess I 'd better go to the drugstore . - Fine . Hey . - Are these ready to be mailed yet ? - Yeah , why ? - I could take 'em to the Post Office for you . - That would be terrific . I 'd appreciate that , Hester . Here , these go in . these have to be stamped . And that stu . Here comes the pony express . Hi . Will you be gone long ? Oh , no . I have to go ... I have to whiz to the drugstore , whiz to the post office ... I have so many things to do , I 'll never get through the day . Oh , I 'm silly . I can ´ t go without the card . Where is the card ? Where is that card ? I haven 't the faintest idea . - how 's Gillian ? - She ´ s doin ´ just fine . That 's good . Gillian ... how about a bacon , lettuce and tomato sandwich ? - OK . - Good girl . Damn ! - I 'll give you a hand . - don ´ t bother . - It 's no bother . - I can take care of it . It ´ s OK . Oh , for God 's sake , move your ass ! I 'll get that , Gillian . Here 's some more , Hester . I killed her . I knew I would , the first time I said hello ... and conned her into helping me . She would have done anything for me . Hey , you better get some sleep . don 't stop . Please keep talking . I 'm afraid to close my eyes . Afraid of what I 'll see . - Sip this . - No , I don 't wanna . Sip it . You 'll feel better . That 's the best thing in the world for a toothache . Tell me about Robin . You tell me . It 's just that ... sometimes I know what ´ s happening to him , what he is thinking ... what He ´ s feeling . I 'm ... like a receiver , and Robin sends me pictures . Jesus , That 's amazing . you 're like twins . He 's a good-looking kid . you 're the kind of girl Robin would like . I raised him myself . His mother died at childbirth . How come you didn 't marry again ? Well , there just hasn 't been anybody . Hester ? Yeah . Hester . When was the last time you saw Robin ? About 11 months . He 's been growing up so fast . You know , I 'm a good athlete , but He ´ s better . The last day at the club , we raced in the pool , about ten laps . He beat me , but I said I won . He said No , you didn ´ t . " ´ I said " ´ I did too . " ´ He jumped up on the side of the pool and said ´ We 'll do it again . 20 laps this time . " ´ I was so dead , I could hardly drag myself out of the water . I said ´ All right . You won , you won . " ´ Tell me , Gillian . How is he ? He 's OK . OK . Yeah . Were all gonna be OK . That 's a promise . Peter ! Stop ! Please , let me o ! I 'm supposed to get o here ! Peter ! - What the hell are you doing ? - You were gonna leave me . Now , look . You got me here . Now stay out of this . - He 's my son . It ´ s my fight . - I don ´ t know who to trust any more . Look , that bus 'll take you to Seattle . I paid the driver. you 'll be safe . You can 't leave me . Get on that bus and stay on it . Peter ! But I can take you to him now . Peter , I was Iying before . Robins not OK . He needs us now . It 's too dangerous . People around me get killed . Dammit , people around me get hurt too ! I make them bleed ! Robin can help me . Please ! Oh , Jesus ! - Why did you do that ? - I don 't like it when you smell like this stu . Could you just leave me alone for a little bit , Robin ? I got tired of waiting for you . What 's taking so long ? - I wanted to have a bath and a little privacy . - But you 're taking too goddamn long ! Is everything all right , Dr Charles ? Yes , everything 's fine . When the others arrive , would you just hold them downstairs for a moment ? I need a few minutes in here , OK ? I 'll call you . Thank you . Robin ? I 'm sorry . Try to understand the strain I 'm under . I 'm very worried about you . don 't be sorry . I didn 't mean to act like that in there . It 's me . I 'm OK now , though . - I 'm OK . - Good . Well , I 'm starved . Do you want something to eat ? Sure . Well , this looks great . I 've been thinking , Robin . Maybe we should take a couple of days o . Get a boat , go up the lake or something . What do you think ? Why did you do that ? So nobody can get in . What 's the matter , Robin ? - You know What 's the matter . - No , I don ´ t . What is it ? It 's that goddamn girl . What girl ? - The one That 's like me . - What do you mean , like you ? You think I don 't know She ´ s around ? She ´ s right out there . - There is no girl . - That 's a lie ! - No , it isn 't , Robin . - She 'll do everything I can do , won ´ t she ? And you won 't miss me at all . What are you trying to say , Robin ? - Company 's coming . - Yes , you know that . There 'll be you and me ... and Dr Ives ... and Childress . And that girl makes five . No , only four , Robin . You can see that the table is set just for four . That 's right . I won 't be here . I 'll be dead . That girls taking my place after you poison me ! What 's the matter , Susie ? What ´ s the matter ? - Oh , God ! Robin ! - Remember ? - I said I didn 't have to touch you to hurt you . - Robin , please stop ! - Well , I 'm hurting you now ! - Stop it ! Cos I don 't love you anymore ! I ´ m tired of you ! you 're killing her ! Stop ! Stop ! No ! Susie , get up . - I said get up . - Robin ! God , stop ! I can make you get up . Turn around . Up . Robin ... Up . Oh , God , Robin ... Up . No , please . Turn around . Again . Faster . Faster . Faster ! Faster . Turn ! Again . Turn . Faster . Faster ! Here . Gimme your hand . Hi , pal . Thought I 'd drop by to say hello . Long time no see . you 're lookin ´ good . Too bad , Peter . You almost made it . Where 's my son ? Why don 't you give up ? You ... Oh , God ! Shit ! Stop ! Stop ! All right , Peter . You said you wanted to see your son . Go ahead and get him . Robin ? Can you hear me ? Robin ! Please answer me . Oh , my God . Robin ! Where is he ? What have they done to you ? Son , I know they told you I was dead , but ... they wanted me out of the way . I never gave up . I kept lookin for you all the time . Come on , Robin . Hey . don 't you recognise your old man ? Peter ! No ! Hang on , Robin . Reach up with your other hand . Come on . Grab ahold of my jacket . Climb over me . That 's it . Come on . You can do it . That 's it . That ´ s it . No ! Oh , God ! Robin ! All right . Get 'em outta here . Get ´ em outta my sight . Good morning . I made some coffee . Would you like some ? No ? It 's warmer by the fire . How did you sleep ? OK ? I was here most of the night . I guess you don 't remember . Move a little closer to the fire . I know what you 've been going through these past couple of days . I know how exhausted you must be . It 'll take more than one night ´ s sleep . I know how I feel . Peter was my friend . Maybe the best friend I 'll ever have . But I had to do what I did . I mean , you saw what happened . Peter could have saved Robin . Instead , he let him go . He deliberately killed his son . I hope you don 't judge me too harshly . I can 't say what I did was right or wrong . I only know I acted ... and It 's done . Robin is gone . Peter is gone . And you 're the only one who matters now . Yes , I know that hurts . That hurts so bad , you wanna lie down and die . But you have to survive . you 're a healthy , strong , young girl and you must survive . You 'll begin by putting all the tragedies behind you . I think that 'll be easier if you accept my help . All the bad things you heard about me just aren 't true . I 'm not a bad man . All I want is for you to trust me . time will take care of the hurting . That 's the simple truth . Tears are good . don 't be afraid of crying . Tears are just what we need right now . I 'll be a good father to you , Gillian . You can depend on that . Gillian ! Where are you ? You go to hell !

Left ! It deviated ! Watch the ball carefully and run ! It 's too soon to score ! Yes Sir ! The ball is losing momentum ! Yes Sir ! The Autumn Rookie Competition ... is just around the corner . However ... To the utmost , our objective is ... the Intercollegiate Tournament . I want all of you to focus ... - and give your best . - Yes Sir ! Chiaki ! Chiaki ? Hey ! Chiaki ! - Chiaki , get a hold of yourself ! - Are you alright ? [ Asuka Girl 's Dormitory ] Teacher ... - Welcome back ! - We 're back ! - Thank goodness for this . - True . Let 's get started ! - I 'm back ! - I 'm back ! - Did you eat ? - I 'm starving ! I 'm so hungry ! - Welcome back ! - I 'm back ! - Yukio ! - I 'm back ! Hurry up ! That was delicious ! Then , we 'll meet in Mari 's room . Uh-huh . Well then , see you at six . - Bye-bye ! - Bye-bye ! Welcome back ! - Then , shall we leave our stuff here ? - Uh-huh . I 'm sorry Kyoko . After we finally got to practice together . It 'll heal till Spring . I can 't play tennis anymore . Do your best , on my behalf too . How about consulting coach Imaoka about a new pair ? It looks like Mr. Imaoka doesn 't have the time for that . " I 'll find a doctor to heal Chiaki 's eye no matter what ! " he said . It 's not the coach 's fault . My receive was weak . I 'm fine as long as I still have an eye . After all , I can still see . - Are you Mr. Imaoka ? - Yes , that 's right . - What ails you ? - The eyes . - You read too much manga , right ? - Yes . - Stick to movies . - Yes Sir . - What 's the condition of Komori Chiaki 's eye ? - Well ... - Since it 's like this ... - What about it ? - And with such an assistant ... - Ah , lewd ! Bleh ! That 's trachoma . Is there any chance for healing ? Well ... It 's impossible for me . This is quite a sensitive matter . Hmm . - I 'll introduce you to someone skilled ? - Who would that be ? He 's a little eccentric tho . He 's called Black Jack . Ladies and Gentlemen , have you ever seen the thing called " love " ? I thought so ! Love is hardly perceivable , and frankly , it can 't be seen . Today , I 'll show you someone 's love story . And whether you can see true love in it or not ... Stay tuned ! - Ah ... I shee a caw ! - Huh ? Who am I ? I 'm the famous Black Jack ! Some call me a miracle making doctor and some call me a love magician . What ? ! How do you know if I 'm the real Black Jack ? It doesn 't matter . You 'll soon find out . At any rate , this young man has just arrived at my residence . It 's open ! Doctor ! You have a cushtomer . It 's that man . You 're Doctor Black Jack , right ? So what about it ? I want you to look at a X-ray and tell me whether it can be healed or not . - Who told you about me ? - Dr. Ishigami from Tezuka Hospital . He said you were university classmates . Ishigami ... Ah ! A weird man who did nothing but watch movies . This is pretty bad ! Both the cornea and the nerve are a mess . It 's also deformed . Who on earth is the patient ? She 's called Komori Chiaki . She 's a 18-year-old Asuka Girl 's College freshman . A ladies school , huh ? - Her parents ' occupation ? - They run a farm in Hokkaido . - And you are ? - I am Imaoka Hiroshi . I 'm a fourth-year at Hongoku University . A school friend asked me to be a substitute tennis coach . Hmm ... Could you please do the surgery ? I refuse ! As expected , there 's no chance of recovery , right ? No ... I didn 't say that . It might be impossible for other doctors ... But with me , there 's a 50 % chance ... Please Doctor ! It doesn 't matter how much it costs . - Don 't get smart with me ! - I 'm serious . I 'll do whatever it takes and get the money ready . The surgery is 30 million , and in cash . - No way ! - You fool ! What 's wrong with a doctor charging adequately for operating with the patient 's life at stake ? ! I understand . - Still , I can 't do it . - Why is that ? - The money ... - Don 't rush ! This eye needs a new cornea . If it 's cornea , there 's some at the eye bank . I 'm an unlicensed doctor , you know . Public institution like the eye bank would definitely send me to jail . Doctors and the police treat me like a sworn enemy . Then ... Please take my cornea . Don 't be absurd ! Will it close ? Hello ! Yes , that 's right . I understand . Chiaki . They say Mr. Imaoka is here on a visit . To Hokkaido ? She said her father is coming tomorrow morning to get her . - You 're quiting school ? - I also tried to stop her . But Chiaki ... She said she doesn 't want to trouble anyone . That 's not it . I just want to breathe my hometown 's air after so long . I beg you ... Don 't go anywhere ! I think it 's too soon to give up . Please don 't think so seriously about it . They say life has a bright and dark side , right ? I just decided to look only at that bright side with my one eye . Cheer up ! Thank you ! A lot has happened but , we have some good memories . Chiaki ... Please write me ! You too , Kyoko ! I 'll surely come see you during winter vacation . Thank you ! Mr. Imaoka is late . The coach is busy you know . Chiaki ... Kyoko ... Do your best together with coach Imaoka . Hey hurry up ! - Good morning ! - Good morning ! Good morning ! Mr. Imaoka ! Please wait Chiaki ! You need to get in this car right now . " If you bring the patient within 2 hours , I 'll do the surgery . " said Black Jack . - Black Jack ? - Come now , hurry ! If you dilly-dally , the cornea will die . And who is this Black Chuck ? He 's a world genius surgeon . He 's unlicensed but , they say he owns some miracle making hands . He 's the only one who can heal Miss Chiaki 's eye . Coach , I 'm not going . Why ? Thank you very much . But , I 'm fine now . Fool ! - You don 't know unless you try ! - That 's right Chiaki . Mr. Imaoka is right . You must try even if there 's only a 1 % chance . Chiaki ... In any case , let 's go meet that doctor ! Okay ? So you 're Chiaki ? Yes . Do you really want to be healed ? Yes ! - Is it already time ? - Huh ? Uh-huh ! I 'll take ham and eggs next time too . She 's Pinoko . What an adowable daughter ! I 'm his wife ! Humph ! I presume you have prepared the 30 million for the surgery , right ? - Yes ! - I have them in here . That 's okay ... Pinoko is my most reliable assistant . Alright ! Let 's get started ! Bravo ! Miss Kyoko ... was it ? Yes . - Are your parents well ? - Yes . - They 're doing fine back home . - I see . You know , since Chiaki lost her mother when she was really just a child ... I keep worrying that she 's feeling lonely . That 's because I 'm mostly away buying horses and rarely at home . Mr. Imaoka , what will you become in the future ? Well ... I intend to become an international airline pilot . Ah , a pilot . A pilot . I see ... And ... Two weeks later ... So , what 's the result ? - Why don 't you see for yourself ? - Huh ? She should be on a stroll by the seashore . So ... the surgery ... It was her own strength that healed her eye . And since I love patients that make a hard effort towards healing ... Chiaki ! Chiaki ! Was 30 million ... too cheap ? - Chiaki ! - Chiaki ! - Are you completely fine now ? - Uh-huh . - What a relief ! - We were worried , you know ? Sorry ! Wait ! Wait up Chiaki ! - Wow ! - Here ! - Congratulations on your recovery ! - Thank you very much ! - You won 't quit school , right ? - You can play tennis too , right ? - Of course she will ! - Hey everyone ... Let 's do our best for the Autumn Rookie Competition ! Let 's do our best ! - Fight ! - Fight ! - Fight ! - Fight ! - Fight ! - Fight ! - Fight ! - Fight ! - Fight ! - Fight ! Move ! Right ! Left ! It deviated ! You 're in perfect shape Chiaki ! - It 's like you 're possessed . - I also am surprised ! - Everything is just like before . - It 's way better than before ! If it 's a dream , don 't wake me up ! What 's wrong ? Someone 's over there . What ? It 's a man . Huh ? ! Where ? Huh ? He disappeared ? Hey ! - You tricked me , right ? - No , I definitely saw him ! Mr. Imaoka ? No . He was tall and had a pale face . It seemed like he was wearing a coat . Huh ? ! Let 's get out . Let 's get out ! No way ! No way ! Hurry up , Chiaki ! No ! It won 't open ! How was it ? No one was there . I mean , the shower room was locked wasn 't it ? Yes . That 's just strange ! I doubt there was a pervert . After all , you didn 't see anything , right ? Chiaki , don 't you remember how he looked like ? Uh-huh ... And he somehow had a blank look . Please get a hold of yourself ! If something were to happen , I would be the one held responsible . Thanks to you , my legs are tired from walking around the school ground . I am sorry ! It might have been my imagination after all . Imagination ? Give me a break ! Quit making fun of people ! Chiaki , I 'm sure it 's because you 're tired . Tiebreak ! 5-6 I 'm ready , Chiaki . 6-all Change court ! - It 's going well ! - Let 's keep it up , we 're almost there . That was nice ! You 're doing good ! - Keep it up ! - That 's the spirit ! - Keep it up ! - Yes . Hold on ! Keep it up ! - Hold on ! - Keep it up ! 7-6 In the rain . - Let 's do our best . - Yeah . A chance Chiaki ! We did it ! What 's wrong , Chiaki ? - Take care ! - Take care ! What in the world happened ? Why did you miss such a golden opportunity ? - She said someone crossed before her eyes . - What ? ! A tall man , all of a sudden ... - What you 're saying makes no sense . - It makes no sense to me either . Chiaki , If you had hit that ball you would 've won the match . I am sorry ! I couldn 't swing the racket because someone was at the net . The opponent player was away from the net . It was a man . He appeared suddenly ... and kept starring at me . What you 're saying makes no sense ! Please don 't condemn Chiaki ! Something 's wrong with her today . She 's being strange . - Are you saying there was a mistake in my surgery ? ! - No , that 's not it . It 's just to make sure that ... So you 're making excuses to get the money back , huh ? ! My surgery was flawless ... Gimme the chair ! Okay . There are many out there trying to publicly strip me of my reputation . My surgery was flawless ! But Chiaki saw an illusion that others didn 't . So could you please take a look at her ? Go ask a psychiatrist that ! A psychiatrist ? ! It 's something psychological . Maybe she 's dissatisfied with something . That would be the cause of her hallucination . Where did you take the transplanted eye from ? The eye bank . Did you underwent the legal procedures ? No . I had an ophthalmologist ID card so ... I took the risk and got it secretly . Just in case , try looking into the owner of the eyeball . Maybe you 'll find something out . Okay . I never disliked such storms . Tokyo eye bank here . I know this is sudden , but you had a theft in the evening of September the 3rd , right ? Such a thing never happened . We manage our business with utmost care . Thefts are out of the question . I don 't know what you 're planning but stop with the harassment ! I haven 't told anyone , you know ? Then where did it leak from ? We 're the only ones who know about that incident . There 's another one ! Huh ? ! The culprit ! Chiaki , Please ! Won 't you tell me the truth ? Chiaki , you 're being strange you know . You 're acting strange lately . I 'm sorry ! But ... But ? This has nothing to do with you . It has nothing to do with me ? Chiaki ... Can 't you see me ? I wonder what the human eye really is ? Do people only love the ones they can see ? Or ... Do they only see the ones they love from their hearts ? Chiaki ... What you believe you saw is just an illusion . You were just tired after the eye surgery . Coach , I 'm doing fine ! Your sense of responsibility and sympathy for hurting my eye ... That 's not it ! Chiaki ... Come now , take a good look at me ! What is it ? I saw that person ! He just headed that way . Chiaki ! I 'm sorry ! I wonder if it 's just an illusion after all ? You are lying . It 's a lie that you saw an illusion . You 're talking nonsense just to avoid me . Excuse me ! Chiaki ... 3 4 5 6 7 8 Okay ! Backhand now ! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Mr. Imaoka ! - Okay ! Once more ! - Where 's Chiaki ? 1 She took a break from practice for a while . I see . 3 She came back sopping wet last night but ... Did something happen ? No ... Okay ! Forehand now ! 1 Could you transmit her " I 'm sorry for being harsh last night " ? 3 Yes . 4 5 6 7 8 Okay ! Backhand now ! 1 2 3 4 5 6 Please , wait up ! Wait ! Wait ! Please , don 't go anywhere ! Chiaki ! I want you to stay by my side ! Pull yourself together , Chiaki ! What 's wrong ? You 're drenched in sweat . Do you have a fever ? A dream , huh ? Whom did you dream of ? Chiaki ... You 're in love , right ? That 's why you 're feeling insecure . You 're right , I 'm certainly in love . You know , Mr. Imaoka said " I 'm sorry for being harsh last night " . Have you had a fight ? You know , I don 't really ... You 've dreamt of Mr. Imaoka , right ? You 're wrong . Oh , come on ! There 's no need to hide it . Don 't misinterpret it ! About coach Imaoka liking me ... He just sympathizes with me . What are you saying ? You know , my lover ... Is this person . Who is he ? I don 't know his name , but he 's a kind person . I spoke with him in my dream for the first time . - Than , is he that person ? - Uh-huh . Handsome , isn 't he ? I 've sketched him before I forget . Are you being serious ? That 's just a girlish hobby ! Falling in love with someone inexistent ... That 's nonsense . It 's okay even if he doesn 't exist . I ... My chest heats up when I think of him . It makes me want to cry . I also think it 's weird , but ... But ... I just can 't help it ! Welcome back ! Mr. Imaoka is waiting for your return . I see . No , no , no ! No ... - Sorry for the wait ! - It 's okay . - What is this about ? - Well , there 's no hurry ... The reason I 've called you ... - Have you found out the identity of the donor . - No , not yet . In that case , I 'll tell you . As a matter of fact , I 've just returned from investigating it . That eye ... until September the 2nd , was the eye of a 23-year-old married woman . - Her name was Tate Yoriko . - Tate Yoriko ? - Does it ring a bell ? - No . Tate Yoriko ... on September the 3rd , her corpse was discovered on a boat at Sagiriko Lake . She was strangled by someone . - I think I read about that in the newspaper . - The criminal is still unidentified ! Listen ... The eye you 've brought was that of the murdered woman , you know ? ! And you think that I 'm the criminal ? I think it was the morning of September the 4th when you came with the eyeball requesting for surgery . Please wait up , I 'm not a doctor ... And removing an eyeball without damaging it would be impossible . Exactly . That 's why the criminal , killed the owner of the eyeball , Tate Yoriko , waited for the eye to be transported to Tokyo eye bank , - and then stole it . - You 're wrong ! It 's just a coincidence that I took it . I 've never even thought about who 's the donor in the first place . We 've arrived ! We 're from the MPD . Hi . You 're gonna have to come with us ! I didn 't kill anyone ! First of all , I was in Tokyo that day . Chiaki was about to quit school and go back to Hokkaido . Never mind that , you 're coming ! Come ! Doctor , please help me ! I 'll remember you . Doctor ! The only thing I can save ... is a patient . Sooner or later ... We 're gonna have to escort you too . I didn 't ... Doctor ! Doctor , please help me ! I 've finally met you . Who are you ? I wanted to meet you . I always believed that we 'll meet someday . Did someone ... put you up to this ? No . What do you want ? Nothing really ... I just wanted to meet you no matter what . I 'm afraid you have the wrong person , because .. I don 't know you . That 's impossible ! You 've always kept staring at me . What you 're saying ... makes no sense to me whatsoever . Is that so ? I 've even dreamt of you . You weren 't an illusion after all . Illusion ? Everyone said you were an illusion . Illusion , huh ... There 's nothing I can do when you call me that . That 's because I 'm already as good as dead . But , you actually really exist . You ... What is your name ? It 's Komori Chiaki . Aki is wrote like the sho from crystal . ( 千晶 = Chiaki , 水晶 = crystal ) Crystal , huh ... I see . You have beautiful crystal-like eyes . Yes . This eye has brought me to you . I don 't know how this sounds , but ... Have you consulted a doctor recently ? How did you know that ? Well ... Just a hunch . Psychiatry , right ? No . Ophthalmology . Ophthalmology ? Is this where you live ? No way . But I sometimes come here . To play this piano . I don 't know what kind of person lived here before , but ... This piano is very graceful . I can really tell . It 's a piano that suits a heart of love really well . Do you also want to smoke ? Why are you staring like that ? What about you ? That seductive look ... That coat ... That shirt ... And also that piano melody ... They 're very nostalgic to me . Excuse me ... What is your name ? Mine ? Yes . It 's Kazama . Kazama Shiro . Shi is like the shi from history . ( 史郎 = Shiro , 歴史 = history ) You properly have a name , right ? Of course I have . Kazama Shiro . Can you give me your hand ? See ! My blood flows properly , isn 't it ? It 's proof that I 'm not an illusion . Are ... Are you married ? No . A lover ? Why ask such a thing ? Why ... I am sorry ! No . I had a lover . But not anymore . Well ... It 's time to go . Where are you going ? To work . Work ? I play the piano at a small club . Please take me with you ! I want to be with you . I 'll wait quietly so that I don 't disturb your work or get you scolded . - No ! - Why not ? You know ... That 's not a place for a girl like you to frequent . Then ... - I 'll wait outside . - And then what ? I don 't know . But if we part ways like this ... What if you disappear again ... If you disappear , I ... Oh my ... Then let 's do like this : Tomorrow , we 'll meet again here . You don 't trust me ? No . I 'll definitely come . This is my proof . Here ... I believe you . Your eye ... Huh ? It 's nothing . But Mr. Imaoka was here in the afternoon . He couldn 't have gone to Sagiriko Lake . Are you sure about that ? You can call me as witness anytime . She 's back . I 'm back ! Mr. detective , I have a favour to ask of you . Could you please keep quiet that Chiaki 's eye was that of the murdered person ? I think that will shock her even more . I understand . Miss Komori Chiaki , right ? Please take a seat . Here . Say Chiaki , do you remember September the 3rd ? September the 3rd ? You know , the day before the surgery . Mr. Imaoka came to visit , right ? Asking leading questions as you please causes us trouble . - I 'm sorry ! - Did something happen ? - Mr. Imaoka is suspected of murder . - Huh ? ! You stay quiet ! So ... uh ... Mr. Imaoka Hiroshi ... Around what time did he come here ? In the evening . Hmm ... In the evening , huh ... Alone ? Yes . How long did he stay ? Around an hour , I think . Could you please tell us in detail about the circumstances at that time ? He came to visit and brought some fruits . If I remember right , it was here ... See ! Exactly as I said , right ? I wonder why is coach Imaoka suspected ? What kind of person was the victim ? A lawyer 's wife , they say . So it 's a woman . Don 't worry , it 'll be alright . Mr. Imaoka has an alibi after all . He will be released . Then ... Tomorrow we 'll go to the Police , okay ? Chiaki ? I have a date tomorrow . With whom ? You can just cancel it . Don 't you care what happens to Mr. Imaoka ? Say Kyoko ... Will you believe what I say ? You know , today ... I met that person . Your handsome illusion ? - I 'd also like to meet him once . - He wasn 't an illusion . I really met him , you know ! He 's a pianist and his name is Kazama Shiro . He said he 'll meet me tomorrow . Did you talk to him ? Uh-huh . Just like I thought , he was a kind person . Cut it out ! You 've dreamed again , right ? That 's obvious . But ... He gave me this pendant . It was an illusion after all . Chiaki , we have to go . I 'll wait a bit longer . Waiting is futile . There 's no way an inexistent person would appear . Why ... There are also cigarette butts on the floor . They could just be anybody 's cigarette butts . Then suit yourself and wait ! I 'm going to the Police . Chiaki ... Don 't you care what happens with Mr. Imaoka ? I 'm sorry , Kyoko ! You 're sick , you know ? You should go see a doctor . Chiaki ... I 'm back ! You 're pretty late . Did he appear ? It must 've been cold . Poor you ! I told you it was futile . He must 've had a reason . I 'm sure he 'll come tomorrow . You 're still saying such things ? You 're a horrible person . You don 't even care how Mr. Imaoka feels . Was coach Imaoka doing well ? - He was released , right ? - Not even close ! You know , Mr. Imaoka ... Then , that means ... He was cleared of the murder accusation . I mean , he has an alibi after all . Then why wasn 't he released ? You know , Mr. Imaoka ... Stole an eye . An eye from the eye bank . And he did it to heal your eye , you know ? Do you realize how much he loves you ? And yet , you ... You should reciprocate Mr. Imaoka 's love . You actually love him , don 't you ? Please stop it with this weird hesitation . I 'm extremely moved . If the two of you get married ... I 'll bless you from the bottom of my heart . I 'm serious . Kyoko ... I also think that ... I probably love coach Imaoka . - But ... - But what ? When tomorrow comes , I plan on meeting that person again . If I won 't meet him , I 'll try the next day ... Chiaki ... There 's someone else inside of me . And that someone ... is pulling me . There 's nothing I can do about it ! Released ? ! That 's right . You 're cleared on all counts . We 've discovered an illegal group within the eye bank . We 're gathering evidence just in case , but ... Most likely you won 't be indicted . You 're also a first offender . You 're slowly meeting the requirements for pardon . Put your thumb print here . Is it dead ? Hello ? Is Komori Chiaki there ? Chiaki is out . Do you know where she is ? Excuse me , but , who might you be ? I 'm Kazama . Kazama ? ! I 'm called Kazama Shiro . No way , you are ... Yes ? Who are you ? Stop it with your weird prank ! Hello ? Hello , Imaoka here ! Mr. Imaoka ! Mr. Imaoka ! Sorry , I 'm here to say goodbye . I quit coaching ... I 'm not qualified to teach anyone . I have no excuse . Where 's Chiaki ? Well ... What 's wrong ? Something strange is going on . - No way , that 's absurd ! - That 's also what I think . But I clearly heard his voice . - Then , let 's go to that place . - Wait . There 's a portrait of him . Chiaki drew it . Alright . Just as I thought , you were here . Yes . I waited for you everyday . I 'm sorry ! Were you ill ? No . Then , you were busy with work , right ? That neither . I didn 't wanted to meet with you anymore . But , you came to see me like this . It 's because of that eye . Everyday when I play the piano , I somehow see that eye glancing at me , and I don 't know why . As days went by ... I gradually started to miss you . I 've missed ... that eye . She always gazed at you like this , right ? The one who was your lover . She must 've been really happy . Why did you break up ? She died . If I remember correctly , you said you went to ophthalmology , didn 't you ? So what was wrong with your eye ? I had a cornea transplant . When ? On September the 4th . It 's over there ! Kyoko ... Are you sure this is it ? Yes ... Say boy , have you seen a girl around here ? There was a couple . A couple ? They 've just left . What kind of person was the man ? He was a cool person . He was tall ... and wore a long coat . The girl was also beautiful . Are you alright Kyoko ? Well ... You pulled me really hard . Kyoko ... The one who was your lover ... What kind of person was she ? Yoriko , huh ... Yoriko you said ? Yeah . Do I ... look like her ? I 'm sorry ! She must 've been way more charming than me . I mean , she was your lover after all . Please ... If it 's okay with you ... I 'd like to stay by your side forever . Stop that ! - Looking at me like that ... - Why ? Your ... eye ... Is it similar ? Is Miss Yoriko 's eye similar to mine ? Tell me ! Please tell me about Miss Yoriko ! Are you sure ? No matter what ? Yes ! Now it is just an old story . I first met Yoriko ... in Champs-Élysées 's scenery . Champs-Élysées ? That 's in Paris . We were both overseas students . I was studying the piano at the Conservatoire . Yoriko was studying cultural anthropology at Sorbonne . We instantly fell in love with each other . We lived together for almost a year in a tiny cheap apartment . Yoriko was a girl like a mimosa flower . Fragile . Ephemeral . Without the support of my strong love , it looked like she would break . I composed a piano melody for Yoriko . It 's that melody , right ? I started to play the piano for Yoriko . And by my side , Yoriko , sat comfortably down the sofa , and drank flower tea . Each day was like a dream . Like a dream . Suddenly , one day , Yoriko was gone . I searched for her like mad . But Yoriko never showed up . It made no sense to me whatsoever . Was that it ? After a year , I received a letter from Yoriko . And it surprisingly was from Japan . It was a short one page letter . A data paper . And on it , with Yoriko-like slender letters , it was written : " Good-bye Mr. Shiro , " " my heart . " I returned to Japan immediately . And then , Yoriko ... She had passed away ? She was married . That 's the end of the story . You never met her again ? Maybe you should 've met her no matter what . Miss Yoriko must 've had her reasons . I 'm sure she would 've wanted to explain that before she passed away . I met her . Just once . At the Sagiriko Lake villa . Sagiriko Lake ? It 's a distant mountain lake . Sagiriko Lake . I 'd also like to go there . Isn 't it great that you were cleared of all charges ? Come now , take a seat . It 's all thanks to you . - I heard you 've used your influence . - No , it was for my own sake . I just couldn 't bear getting entangled in a theft case . - I 'm very sorry about it . - It 's okay , but just between us , I happened to save the MPD Commissioner 's life after operating his stomach cancer . Well , also his hernia while at it . So , what do you want ? Did you came just to thank me ? Well , to tell you the truth ... It 's about Komori Chiaki 's eye . Did she see another illusion ? No , it wasn 't an illusion . - She really happened to meet him . - Say what ? ! Please take a look at this . This guy is the criminal ! The criminal 's image got imprinted on the victim 's eye . If I remember correctly ... When she saw the illusion ... - It was on a rainy day , right ? - Yeah . Both at the tennis court and the coffee shop . It happened first in the shower . They 're all connected to water . Tate Yoriko was murdered on a boat over Sagiriko Lake . Ah ! That 's why the illusion appears easier near water . We need to catch this guy at once ! What 's wrong ? We have no idea where he is . He disappeared together with Chiaki . What ? ! That guy 's dangerous ! The criminal might 've found out about Chiaki 's cornea secret . Something bad may happen if we don 't find them quickly ! Could you sit over there ? No , not there . Here on this sofa . On that day , you ... I meant Yoriko sat there and was drinking flower tea . Could you cross your legs ? Could you try smoking ? I have taught Yoriko ... everything . If it weren 't for me , Yoriko couldn 't have done anything . How to smoke ... The skill to make a soft boiled egg ... And also ... How to play the piano . [ Tate Masahiko ] I am lawyer Tate . I am Imaoka , the one who just called . We 're sorry for the sudden visit . About my wife ... You wanted to talk about her ? Yes . Do you know a man named Kazama Shiro ? Kazama Shiro ? I don 't know him . It 's this person . Please take a good look , he might be the one who killed your wife . I 've seen him before . Excuse me ... Welcome ! She 's Sono , my younger sister . This is susuri tea . Sono , I 'm sorry but ... Could you bring me Yoriko 's album . Yes , elder brother . Go ahead . It 's this person ! I 'm sure of it ! - They 're pictures from Paris . - Paris ? Yoriko was ... An overseas student . Elder brother ... Sono ... It was our reunion after a year . Without saying anything ... I kept silent for a long time . I prayed ... For a miracle to happen again . I was so sad that my chest was about to burst . Yoriko ... Let 's go together to Paris again ! Our youth ... is already over . The Mr. Shiro that I 've loved ... Is already dead . The Paris event ... is inside a fog called past . The Yoriko from here is a different woman . Are you serious ? I love my husband . We live in harmony . Don 't you love me anymore ? Yoriko . Mr. Shiro 's love ... is extremely pure and ... it 's too unfit for me . I 'm unsuited for you . The person inside of me that you are gazing at ... That 's how I always felt about that . The one you love is not the present me . Cast the present me aside ... and also the thoughts of me being the ideal woman that you dream of ... Yoriko ... I love you ! Please ... Don 't condemn me any further . I 'm just an ordinary timid woman . I 'm not suited to be an artist 's wife . Being together with me would just be a waste of your talent . Yoriko ! Have you forgot ... this melody I made for you ? Yoriko ... Is it over for us ? Are we really over ? Tell me again that you love me ! Yoriko . That must 've been heartbreaking . It looks like there 's no contact from Chiaki . Where could she have disappeared with that man ? Does Chiaki known that her eye is that of Sagiriko Lake murder case ... I couldn 't tell her that . I kept that a secret . Sagiriko Lake , huh ? Let 's go there . I kinda got a bad feeling about it . I 'm sorry ! Oh ... What a pretty lady ! Nice couple ! Today , you know ... - Let 's drink together for a very happy occasion ... - We 're in a hurry ... - Please stop ! - Let 's drink together . For a happy occasion ! Let him go ! Go away ! Stop it ! Very happy ... Hurray ! Come now , let 's go ! Morning ... Lake ... and , Love So ... How did Miss Yoriko pass away ? Don 't tell me ... Was it suicide ? She was murdered . On top of this boat . Please ... Kill me ! Kill me , Mr. Shiro ! Yoriko ... I ... want to die ! I want to die ... in your arms . Let 's die together ! If we die we 'll be together for eternity . It 's the only way for us to love each other . Mr. Shiro ... Mr. Shiro . Yoriko ... I 'm Chiaki ! This eye ... That 's Yoriko 's eye ! Yoriko ... This time let 's die together for sure . Our love will live on ! Okay ? Okay ? Yes . I love you ! I love you ! Over there ! Chiaki ! What are you doing you bastard ? ! - Stop or I 'll shoot ! - Chiaki , fight back ! You can do it ! Mr. Shiro ? Chiaki ! Sagiriko Lake murder case solved ! The criminal commits suicide ! - Thank you very much ! - Thank you very much ! No , I ' m glad you 're unharmed . It 's all thanks to you . Thank you ! The only thing I can save is a patient . What about that illusion ? I 'm fine now . If it feels creepy ... I won 't mind replacing your cornea again . No thanks ! Because I love this eye . I kinda feel I can see love clearly with it . I 'll tell you something good . This young man , you know , when he first came here ... He told me that I could use his cornea for the transplant . By the way ... - I 'm returning this . - But that 's the surgery fee ... You 're getting married , right ? Well , not yet ... That 's okay ! That 's okay ! But having a debt towards the wife 's father is kinda unpleasant . Doctor ... You 're an amazing person . An excellent doctor . And yet , I despised you this whole time . I thought you were an awful doctor that performs surgeries for money only ... I 'm terribly sorry about it ! I 'm not an excellent doctor . An excellent doctor ... isn 't despised by anybody . Acchon ! Acchon ! Good-bye ! Good-bye . Say Doctor , what is love exwactly ? How should I put it ... That 's complicated . Is it like an iwusion ? That 's right . It 's like an ... illusion . Can Pinoko shee it too ? Who knows ... A child might not be able to see it . I 'm not a child ! I 'm a lady ! Pinoko , you know ... She loves you . She loves you very much . Alright , alright ! Even Pinoko can shee love , you know ? Acchonburike ! The story ends here . Komori Chiaki borrowed someone else 's eye to see love . I guess seeing love with your own eyes isn 't that farfetched right ? What about you , ladies and gentlemen ? Did you see something ? Well then ... See you some other time ! Keep it up ! Keep it up ... Chiaki ! Yes ! Chiaki ! Cameo Appearances : Chiba Shinichi Dan Fumi Fujita Toshiya GODIEGO ( Song • DEAD END ) Kinoshita Keiko ( Pinoko 's voice ) subbed by bLoodZ @ AvistaZ , ADC KG

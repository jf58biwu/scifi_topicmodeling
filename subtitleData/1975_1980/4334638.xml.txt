 Fire ! [ Groans , Sighs ] How 's the pain ? Aah . The bullet must 've lodged ... - close to a nerve , Pete . - Is that bad ? [ Sighs ] We 've got to get him to a hospital . Yeah , great , Pete . What hospital ? Our Blue Cross expired about a thousand years ago . There is a medical center outside Central City . Come on , Galen . You must be out of your mind . We walk into an ape hospital , we can forget about reading any more continued stories . How good is that medical center ? It 's the best in the world ... uh , this world . I 'm not gonna let you two stick out your necks . Galen , even if we do get him in there , the apes don 't reserve their best medical treatment for humans . I know the chief surgeon . She 'll help us . Galen , we 're enemies of the state . - You 've got no choice . - She 's a physician . She doesn 't care about your politics . Even if she did know about you , she wouldn 't turn her back on anyone in trouble . - You know that ? - Yes . We used to be very close once . In fact , we were going to get married , but things didn 't work out . But we are still the best of friends . I 'll be back as soon as I can . - Galen , no ! - Shh . I 'll be all right . I know a back route to the city . I 'll be fine traveling alone . And don 't worry about my being able to convince Kira . - I happen to be an expert on feminine psychology . - Hmph . Hmph . Hmm , hmm . Galen- - Nothing . Kira , I watched the operation . You did a brilliant job . Technically brilliant . And the patient died . The operation was a success ! The surgical knowledge we learn from these failures will someday ... benefit other patients , other surgeons ! That 's not a very satisfying philosophy . You think I 'm cruel ? Hmm ? You can tell me the truth . Tell the truth to my superior ? I could be fired for such recklessness . Only a fool would fire his best and most beautiful surgeon . I 'll see you at the conference tomorrow night , won 't I ? - Conference ? - Aprivate lecture I 'm giving ... on the therapeutic virtues of vegetable casserole ... and apricot wine . I 'm holding it in my apartment at 8 : 00 . Is attendance mandatory ? Only for you . In that case , I 'll be there . Hello , Kira . As simple as that ? This to remind me , a casual hello ... and everything else is forgotten ? - Not everything . - Go away , Galen . Kira , I need your help . - You are a criminal and a traitor . - You don 't really believe that . What else would I believe ? I don 't want to argue with you . Go away . - It 's dangerous with you here . - A friend of mine has been hurt . You don 't have any friends but renegade humans . Unless you help him , he may die . Why should I care if a human dies ? If for no other reason because I care ... a very great deal . I don 't know you anymore . You 're a stranger who 's chosen to live with humans . Is that such a dreadful crime ? - I should call the police ! - They 'd kill me . - They 'd be doing justice . - I loved you . And to hear you say those words now- - [ Sighs ] I 'm sorry I came . Galen ! You were a decent , law-abiding ape once . What happened ? Well ... I had this terrible accident . I collided with the truth . I discovered that humans and apes ... are supposed to be equals , not masters and slaves . Do you really believe that ? Oh , yes . Yes . And to help you I must help them ? They are my brothers now . Oh , Galen . I thought I 'd forgotten you , and a chance to find a new happiness . I should 've known you 'd come back to destroy that chance . What took you so long ? Well , I had to pick up a medical degree . This is for that renowned specialist , - Dr. Adrian . Hmm ? - Wonderful . And this is a smock , and it 's for his faithful servant . - Naturally . - Under the circumstance , it was the best position available . Listen , even if this crazy masquerade works , that hospital 's miles away . I can barely stand , let alone walk . I 'd never make it . My dear Alan , a patient of your eminence should not have to walk at all . Not at all . Yeah , well ? I-I 'm delivering grain for the prefect . I need help . He will beat me if I am late . [ Grunts ] You didn 't seem very excited about my vegetable casserole . - Did I put too much honey in it ? - No , it was delicious , really . It 's just that ... well , I 'm not very hungry tonight . Something worrying you ? I was thinking of that orderly we sent to disciplinary camp for disobeying orders . Do you think we dealt with him a little bit too harshly ? He behaved like an unruly beast . Like an unruly beast , he deserved to be punished . - Where 's the harshness ? - But are humans nothing but beasts ? At their best , they 're useful animals . At their worst , they 're carriers of hatred and destruction . - [ Knock At Door ] - Come in . I 'm sorry for interrupting , There 's a new arrival . A Dr. Adrian ? Dr. Adrian . That 's the doctor you mentioned to me . I 'll show him to his rooms . Thank you for a lovely evening . My pleasure . - Hello , Dr. Adrian . - Dr. Kira , I 'm sorry we are late , but we met with this accident . My personal servant has been injured . Travin , make room for these two in the humans ' quarters . Yes , Doctor . - I 'll show you to your room , Dr. Adrian . - Mmm , yes . - Where ? - Put him on that bed . Wait a minute . Not here . He needs his own room . I have my own room . All the other humans sleep here . Put him down . - He 's very sick . He needs special care . - Pete , forget it . We don 't provide special care for sick humans . If a man is sick , he rests . If he lives , he returns to work . That 's a very progressive system , but it doesn 't apply to us . - It applies to everyone . - Pete , let it alone . We work exclusively for Dr. Adrian , and he gets nervous when his servants get pushed around . So whatever passes for the luxury accommodations here , - that 's where my friend goes . - Let it alone . Would you prefer that I have Dr. Adrian report you to Dr. Kira ? - In there . - Thanks . I really appreciate it . This is terrific . What is it , dried mule hooves ? You wouldn 't have sauce for a taste killer , would you ? - We have what we have . - [ Pete ] Oh . Oh , thank you . Don 't talk to her ! I-I was just gonna ask her her name . She has no name . Look , everybody 's got a name . Her name was taken from her . She is no one . What 'd she do , criticize the chef ? The girl is his daughter . - All right , Kira , what do you think ? - [ Sighs ] It 's no good . All the medical texts deal with apes . There 's nothing on humans . But you know where the bullet is . We know the bullet is lying near a nerve . We don 't know what the nerve looks like or where it runs . It may be in an area of large blood vessels . If we go in blindly , we could kill him . Which proves that you do care what happens to him . I 'm a surgeon . Don 't just go blundering in with a knife to see what will happen . To operate in ignorance is butchery . If I could find a book on human anatomy , would it help ? There are no books on human anatomy . What ape would 've bothered to write one ? No , I mean a human book . What are you talking about ? Humans do not write medical texts . They used to a long time ago when they ruled the earth . You 're really mad , aren 't you ? No . I 've seen such books . Where ? In the fantasies of your deranged mind ? No , no . In Zaius 's study . Kira , thought you were scheduled ... to give a lecture to the staff this morning . Oh , uh , yeah . I postponed it . I wanted to show Dr. Adrian our facilities . Oh , Dr. Adrian . Hi . What 's your impression , Doctor ? Oh , fantastic . Absolutely fantastic . Far beyond anything I 've seen in my life . Of course , I 'm not certain that I would agree with all your procedures . Oh ? And what quarrel do you have with our procedures ? I wouldn 't wish to cause any offense . No , no , we 'd be most happy to hear your learned opinion . - Wouldn 't we , Dr. Kira ? - Oh , yes . Yes . Dr. Adrian is very renowned in his field . Hmm . As I see it , there 's altogether too much emphasis these days upon surgery . Everything from a broken leg to the vapors . While I do believe surgery is necessary in some cases , I prefer the more conservative approach to medicine . Uh-huh . You mean a special potion for every ailment ? - And / or leeches . - Huh ? Except , of course , in the case of the common cold . Oh , that misfortune still has myself and others in my field ... - stumped . - [ Laughing ] I like our visitor . Do your best to keep him here . - I look forward to working with you , Doctor . - Thank you . " I look forward to working with you , Doctor . " You were a great help . Do you think that man is a fool ? This whole thing is ridiculous . And this crazy imposture , this mysterious book in Zaius 's library ! I will get you that book . With that in your hands , you can advance our medicine . That book is life . If we are caught , it means death . If we get caught , I 'll confess that I forced you to do this by threatening your life . Do you think I want you to die ? No one wants to die- - human or ape . But we can 't turn back now . We can 't . [ Alan Groans ] [ Alan Mumbling ] Wherever it is , this isn 't Earth . - Alan . - Where is it ? It 's all right , Alan . - Th-th- - They 're apes ! - It 's okay . - This world is run by apes ! - Hey . Take it easy . Come on . What is he saying ? Everyone knows the world is run by apes . What does he mean , " this isn 't Earth " ? Huh ? I didn 't realize orderlies here did psychological studies of the patients . - I only meant- - - That man is having fever hallucinations . It 's your job to take care of him . If he dies , I shall have to break in a new orderly , and I shall hold you personally responsible . - Yes , Doctor . - Yes . Yes . - Indeed . - That guy worries me . [ Crying , Screaming ] Cut it out . I said , cut it out ! Stop ! What 's going on here ? Tell me . Lafer , what happened ? It was her fault . She spilled the water . Is that why you beat her , because she spilled the water ? All of us are required to discipline the girl . It 's our duty . The girl is evil and must be punished ... so the evil doesn 't touch us . - She 's your daughter . - I have no daughter . Sir , I don 't wish to be insolent , but humans are forbidden to carry knives in the city . My servant is permitted to do what I tell him to do . Sir , this is the guard . Good . This human who attacked you , what did he look like ? I don 't know . I couldn 't tell . All humans look alike . Yeah , well , that 's true . How many of them were there ? You must 've seen something . What was it ? There were two . One was a human , the other a chimpanzee . You 're saying an ape helped a human commit a crime ? I am handling this . Now , are you sure you 're not spreading some kind of a ... hallucination ? What- - Look at me ! What you 're trying to say is ... that you were frightened ... and you couldn 't tell who it was who attacked you . - Isn 't that right ? - Yes , sir . Good . You 've done your duty . You can go now . Stupid country ape ! A chimpanzee helping a human . [ Chuckles ] Cleon , you are a fool . This patrol that sighted the astronauts the other day , how sure were they of the sighting ? That patrol belongs to one of our best garrisons . They 're absolutely certain the astronauts were heading into the northern mountains ... - away from Central City . - Could they have changed directions ... and come back towards Central City ? This is the most heavily patrolled area in the world . It isn 't logical they 'd take such a risk . Logical ? If they were logical , they would not be human ! They 're driven by strange impulses . I think I 'll cancel my trip into the new territories . I think I 'll stay right here for a few more days . Yes , sir . Been in this route before ? A few times . Halt ! This is a restricted area . What are you doing here ? Emergency . We have been summoned to the house of Zaius . - Zaius ? - He has had a heart attack . Are we going to spend the rest of the day discussing it ? No , sir . We 'll give you an escort . Proceed . Sally . Oh , Sally . Don 't go away . Honey , I 'll get home ... as soon as I find the ship . You 'll wait for me , Sally , please ? Sally . Ooh . [ Mumbles ] - No ! - Calm yourself . It 's Dr. Kira . I 'm sorry . I was having a bad dream . Where 's Pete and Galen ? They 've gone to get a ... surgical book ... supposedly written by one of your doctors a thousand years ago . I 'm a scientist . I deal in realities . Even if this ... mysterious book exists , your chances of survival are virtually hopeless . Then why bother to operate ? There 's a chance that we may ... learn something . Something that would help us ... to treat our own patients someday . Is that the only reason ? You think I have some feeling for Galen , or for your friend or for you ? Maybe . Galen means no more to me than you do . Do you understand that ? I understand ... the words . Humans are nothing . You have no character . No sense of honor , no loyalty . If they did , you never would have allowed yourself to be brought here . I mean , Galen is risking his life , and you can 't even see the danger ... that he 's in because of you , because you are blind and sentimental . And you can 't control your thoughts or emotions . And you will destroy Galen ! And your friend . And you 'll all be destroyed ! Where do you think you are going ? Into the house , if Zaius needs help . My dear fellow , Zaius has had a heart attack . Now that is a medical condition , not a criminal offense . You would be much better off guarding this ambulance . A colleague of mine had the wheels stolen off his cart ... almost within sight of the police garrison . Terrible , terrible . Stay here . - Galen , come on . - Hmm ? Oh . I was just remembering the happy hours I spent in this room ... talking with Zaius . There . Hey , there it is as always . - It 's locked . - No , it isn 't . Hmm ? Where did you learn to do that ? [ Chuckles ] Jersey City , P.S. 1 03 . Oh ! - That 's it . That 's the one . - Good . Now that we 've got it , how are we gonna get it out of here ? Oh , uh- - Aha ! Here , Pete . - Help , please . - What ? - Come on . - Oh . - There we go . - You sly little monkey , you . [ Laughing ] There . Now we need some pillows . Pillows . Right . Got ' em . My diagnosis is , not only is he suffering from a heart attack , but a most severe heart attack . Oh , yes . I can 't even find his pulse . - Come on . - Ha-ha . [ Chuckling ] Oh , wait a minute . The candle . - Set ? - Yep . Diagrams of the circulatory system . Surgical procedures . Is this a medical text or a work of fiction ? You knew the answer the moment you saw it . I can 't believe that a human wrote this . If Zaius knew about it , why didn 't he let us know ? Political reasons . If humans could write books like this , would they be content to be slaves ? Zaius was afraid that it would mean the end of our civilization . - What if he was right ? - [ Knock At Door ] Come in ! Dr. Adrian 's servant is very sick . Watch out for the apes . It ' s an ambush . He can 't tell us . Look out ! He 's in bad shape . I don 't think we can delay that operation much longer . Except for Galen . He 's a good ape . Trust him . We may not be able to operate . What ? What do you mean ? His hallucinations indicate that the bullet has moved closer to a nerve . If we try to operate , that could cause severe internal bleeding . In his condition , he can 't stand any kind of a blood loss . We can transfuse blood during the operation . Blood transfer is impossible . We tried it a few years ago . - On apes ? - On a human . The patient suffered a severe reaction . Died within minutes after the blood transfer . Leander concluded that transferring blood ... from one being to another is against the laws of nature . You must 've tried it with a mismatched donor . There 's a simple blood test we can do right here to find a compatible donor . Surely there must be one among all these humans . [ Sighs ] - [ Pete ] This won 't hurt . - [ Woman Gasps ] See , I told you . I 've only got 1 1 samples . I was told there are 1 2 humans here . - There are only 1 1 . - What about the girl ? She 's not a person . - You better get her anyway . - I don 't take orders from you . One moment . It could be dangerous to tamper with these people 's taboos . Do you really need this girl ? Virdon 's blood type is AB-negative . Statistically , there 's one chance in ten of finding a compatible donor . - Where is the girl ? - Th-These blood samples , is it permissible to ask what they 're for ? It is not permissible . Where is the girl ? Cleaning the hall . Got it . Thanks very much , folks . That 's all . Hi . I just want to talk to you . No one may speak to me except through my father . Well , we 're in luck because he just told me I could speak to you . I need you to help me . How- - How can I help you ? We 're running some tests . It 's a medical experiment Dr. Adrian 's conducting . We want to take a small sample of everybody 's blood . I-I 'm sorry . No , wait a minute . Hold it . Um- - It 's only gonna be a tiny bit of blood , like you scratched your finger . It won 't hurt . And it 's gonna be kinda hard ... to turn a really important ape doctor like Dr. Adrian down . Oh , yeah . For what it 's worth , I promise I won 't let anything happen to you . I won 't let anyone hit you anymore . And , uh , I 'll even take the blood myself . Ha . Didn 't know I could do that , did ya ? Trust me . Hmm ? I-I trust you . No good . It 's an O-positive . That leaves us with just two compatible donors : AB-negative and an O-negative . One of them 's that clown I clobbered . I hope his blood 's in better shape than his brain . Brigid , where 's Lafer ? Mmm . Answer the question . - He 's not here . - One can see that ! He heard that someone was going to have to take all of his blood away . He was afraid . He ran off . Please , may I go now ? Oh , yes , yes . You did say there was another eligible donor ? At least I hope you did . I 'll get her . You want to take my blood . The procedure 's safe . You could save his life . No ! - Let go of me ! - Listen to me ! - I 'm not gonna hurt you . I promise . - Please let go . I know there are superstitions- - I said , hold it ! Listen to me . I know there are superstitions about giving blood- - that it drains strength and life- - but that 's all nonsense . I wouldn 't do anything to hurt you . I told you I can 't give you my blood . I 'm evil . - Please let me go . - Who says you 're evil ? Why are you evil ? - Please leave me alone . - Tell him . I said , tell him . No , please . Tell him . I-I killed my brother . He was 1 6 . My only son . It was a hunting accident . They took him back to the center . The doctors were doing experiments with blood transfer . It was the only time they ever tried such a thing . I told them they could use my son in the experiment . I wasn 't putting his life in danger . He was dying . - This was a way to save him . - So what happened ? My , uh , daughter gave him her blood . The boy died . She killed him with her evil blood ! Now listen to me . Her blood was not evil , it was incompatible . It was the wrong chemical type , that 's all . That 's what killed your son . That transfusion should never have been tried . If she gives your friend her blood , he 'll die ... just like my son . Okay , little lady , you just lie still . And when I tell you to , you can start squeezing on that piece of wood . Okay ? Pulse is 72 . Respiration 's normal . This book was written by humans . What if it 's wrong ? - A little late for that now , isn 't it ? - Be quiet , both of you . Are you ready to start ? Yes . [ Leander ] Kira , why didn 't you tell me you were operating ? Oh , that is my fault , Doctor . I was supposed to notify you . I forgot . I 'm terribly sorry . - What kind of operation is this ? - A bullet wound . [ Kira ] The nervous system may be affected . [ Leander ] How did the human get a bullet wound ? You see , Doctor , my colleagues and I were attacked by this bear . Now , fortunately ... we were able to subdue the beast . But , unfortunately , my orderly was accidentally shot . Now Dr. Kira is going to try a new , experimental ... surgical technique of mine . And if it works , Doctor , think ... just think . - It can be applied to apes . - Yes , yes . Ahh ! The girl . You 're planning a blood transfer . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to do anything . - You stay right where you are . - There could be intensive bleeding . We tried a blood transfer with her once . It didn 't work ! But this is a new process , Doctor , one I have been trying in my clinic . If what you say is true , we may be on the threshold of a breakthrough in medicine . Mm-hmm ! Mmm . May I join you ? Oh , a pleasure , Doctor . Apleasure ! But would you mind just wearing this mask ? We find it very useful in protecting us from the vapors . Ah . You practice ... a fascinating kind of medicine , Dr. Adrian . I 'm quite eager to watch you in action . [ Alan Breathing Deeply ] [ Breathing Deeply ] Dr. Adrian , better put a clamp on that bleeding vessel . It is so seldom that a country doctor ... has the opportunity to see a surgeon such as yourself at work . I would like to watch you . It 's only some minor bleeding ! Mmm . However- - [ Kira ] I can 't reach the bullet . It 's trapped ... between a nerve cluster and large blood vessel . There 's no way of removing that . - Better close up . - [ Pete ] Wait a minute . Make a second incision ... three inches below the first . We 'll try to get at the bullet from below the entry point . - What is he saying ? Who is he ? - My orderly . An orderly giving instructions to Dr. Kira ? Let me see that book . The book ! Well , I- - I see you have things well in hand , Doctors . I think I can resume my other duties now . Mmm . Dr. Leander . Mmm ? I think you 'd better stay . Did he force you to do this ? - No . - Then why ? I 'm a doctor . I have no right to reject the truth . The truth ? That book is not truth ! The book is treason , madness ! That book exists ! And to deny what exists is madness . - Go on with the transfer . - He 'll die . I know he 'll die . If I had been here instead of at a Council meeting , I would not have thought it necessary to call the police ... over a minor burglary . In my opinion , no crime is minor . Do you , uh- - - Do you have a key for this cabinet ? - Why ? Well , let 's call it intellectual curiosity . Even a brutish policeman has the right ... to expand the potential of his limited mind . - Agh ! Agh ! - [ Chuckles ] Thank you . Very impressive , this . Very impressive . And dangerous . You should have burned these as I warned you long ago . One day ... these books will serve us . They will enslave us , Zaius . And the process has already begun . Look , look , Zaius . One of them is missing . Our burglar , it seems , was a better critic than we supposed . What does the burglar have , Zaius ? A volume on human politics or a manual of war ? A book of surgery ! Well ? Is there anything else ? No , Zaius . No . You 've told me everything I need to know . Fascinating . The blood transfer seems to be working . - Maybe now you 'll change your mind about us backward humans . - On the contrary . This whole exercise merely demonstrates the low level of your intelligence . Even if your friend survives , he 'll hinder your escape . You 'd have done much better letting him die in the forest . Kira , look ! Look ! I can 't get a pulse . Doctor ! The anesthesia must 've affected his heart . There 's a stimulant- - What 's the matter ? Don 't your trust an ape surgeon ? Or are you waiting for verification from the great Dr. Mather ? The small bottle on the second shelf ! I 'm getting a pulse . Thank you , Doctor . I don 't like to see patients dying in my operating room . It ' s bad for morale . There it is . The bullet . Come on . Let 's close up . That 's it . Is he gonna be all right ? Yeah , he 's gonna be all right , thanks to you . I think you can forget about that nonsense about your evil blood . He should have an uneventful recovery . - [ Galen ] Listen . - [ Hoofbeats ] Leander , listen . Urko . - You ! Yes , you . Come here . - Me ? Yes , sir . We 're looking for two humans and a renegade ape . Listen , we 're looking for some fugitives . Where are they hiding ? - Fugitives ? - Yes . Two humans with a chimpanzee . - I don 't understand . - You 're lying ! Urko , your shouting is disturbing my patients . It 's all right , Travin , you can go . The astronauts are here . - Astronauts ? - Humans . Two humans . Special humans , different . They- - - One may be wounded . - Oh , those . - Yes . Where are they ? - Gone . - Gone ? Where ? - Gone . I don 't know where . No ! I suggest you go , too , as quickly as possible . - Are you trying to give me orders ? - No , of course not . I am merely giving you a medical warning . Come with me . Come . See ? The room of the dead . The busiest room since the coming of the plague . - The plague ? - The Black Death . Seven cases in the last few days . When the strangers heard of it , they fled . Of course , if your duty compels you to search the hospital- - Urko displayed a proper and satisfying respect for the plague . [ Kira ] Why did you help these humans ? I was afraid they might take you along with them . And we have a date for tonight . Besides , if they had searched further ... they might 've found that . I can 't leave here without knowing the name of the girl who saved my life . Tell him . My name is Arna . Arna . Thank you , Arna . - Good-bye . - Good-bye . Welcome to the Plague Express . I told you we 'd travel first-class . When I come back , Arna , well , you know it 'll be different ... in every way I can make it so . I know . - He will come back ? - Oh , believe me , he will . The last thing in the world I need is another human . It 's clear . You 'd better go now . What do I say ? If you 're asking my opinion , I would suggest " good-bye . " And no thanks to you ? Oh , I helped your friends , but they helped me to have an accident- - to collide with the truth about humans . It does permanent injury to one 's beliefs . I 've begun to see the effects even on Leander . - I like him . - So do I. Good-bye , Galen . Good-bye . And thank you .

 Paul . What is he doing ? He doesn 't know anything about a computer . Kano. stop him . Ted. come away from there . Commander Koenig ! Ted ! Sandra. get security . Security to Main Mission . Security to Main Mission ! Ted . Ted ! Help ... me . John . - You all right ? - Yes . Paul. check out all systems . This is Main Mission . All sections report . Switch on the big screen . See if we can pick up anything . - You 're losing picture . - Picture gone . Scanner shows that the object is not moving . I do not understand . Look at that monitor. it is getting closer to us . Sandra. are you sure that ... We 're locked in its orbit . Transmission coming in . 'Earthmen . 'Do not resist . 'You are the captives of the planet Triton . ' Commander. power failures in sectors G6 . 8 and 11 . All transportation out . - What about the main power unit ? - I can 't get through to Anderson . All nuclear generators and reactors are OK . But running on minimal capacity . Report from Reconnaissance . All but four of our Eagles are damaged . We 're defenceless . Kano ? Computer unable to make any calculations . Insufficient data . - Try every possible variable . - Yes. sir . Why did they not destroy us ? Paul. try to make contact with them . Use sound. light. radio wave patterns . The entire frequency scale . Tell the Professor to meet me . Helena. find out what killed Ted Clifford . - That may not be possible . - Make it possible ! I want to know what we 're up against . - What do you know about Triton ? - Nothing . Their warning was transmitted over every monitor on the base . I 've been to Central Computer . It has no record of any such planet . I haven 't checked my own charts yet . If only we could speak to them . - Paul. any contact ? - No response. sir . They must be receiving . Ted Clifford wasn 't transmitting classified information for nothing . If they won 't talk to us . We 'll just have to pay them a visit . I don 't think it 'll be a surprise . I 've got a nasty feeling we 're being watched . We 've actually seen it . At the base of the brain in the cerebellum . A ball of orange light . Very weak . Pulsating . Then it died out . There was little brain tissue left . Most of it had ... melted . Melted ? The analysis shows that the cerebrum . Which regulates speech. hearing and importantly. vision. had expanded to three times its normal size . The neuronal system. which transmits information through the nerves . Was functioning at 1.000 times its normal speed . Together they somehow enabled Ted Clifford to see and act as though he were a computer . Alan . I want a thorough survey . Two-zero altitude . See if a landing 's possible . Get closer if you can. but under no circumstances are you to touch down . These Tritonians might not appreciate our looking them over . We shouldn 't wait for them to make the next move . We 're taking a look . That 's the next move . It 's the wrong one . Commander . They 've already killed Ted Clifford . Those are your orders . Carter . Is that clear ? Yeah . Perfectly clear . Commander . Eagle 3. ready to lift off . - Eagle 3 to Alpha . - ' Koenig here . ' All systems A-OK . Range 1-0-5 and closing . I can see a ... A kind of a surface . No sign of activity . 'Range 8-5. closing . ' Commander. there 's a beam of light being projected from the sphere . Confirmed . Commander . I 'm going for a 90-degree turn . It 's no go . Commander . I can 't get away from the light . - What 's the range ? - 3-5 . I can 't hear you . Commander . Range . 2-0 and holding . - Switch to automatic . Alan ! - The glare is increasing . - It 's a force field. divert . - Visibility zero . Carter ! Answer me . It 's no use . They 're on a collision course . They 're on manual . I can 't bring them in . Should land close by . About 700 metres . Rescue and medical units stand by . - There 's no way to get to him . - We 'll walk . They 're down . - ' Commander. this is Morrow . ' - ' Yes . Paul . ' 'I 've got their exact location . North east . 600 metres . ' 'Mathias ? ' Donovan is dead . Commander . Carter 's still alive . Paul. malfunction in scanner systems . They have all gone dead . It 's no accident . Paul . An attack ? - Commander . - Yes . Paul ? 'They 've jammed the scanners . They 're up to something . 'You better get back here . ' We 're more than halfway there . We 'll go on . I don 't want to risk getting caught in the open . All right. let 's go . John . Take cover ! Helena. stop ! Helena ! 'Do not be afraid . Dr Russell . 'Enter . ' - Helena ! - It 's all right . John . Easy . Commander . You 'll be OK . John. er ... They 've taken Helena . - Do we have power ? - Yes. all systems are working . We 've got to get through their force field . Without knowing their energy source ? What if we ... modify one of our Eagles ? Double the power of our anti-gravity shields . - Triple it. whatever it takes . - Might work. but no guarantees . - Work on it . Victor . - All right . - What about Carter ? - He 'll make it . Good . - And copilot Donovan ? - Dead . They planned it . John . They just wanted to get Helena out there alone . No . I don 't think so . Why take Clifford ? There 's no connection . Maybe Dr Russell is a hostage . For what reason ? The way they killed Clifford . The shock wave . Locking us in orbit . No. whatever they want from us in return ... they could simply ... just come and get it . Who are you ? 'We are of the planet Triton . ' I am from the planet Earth . 'We know . ' Then you know we mean you no harm . We need your help . 'No . Dr Russell . 'It is you who shall help us . 'We are the eyes of the planet Triton . 'Everything that is ... 'has been 'and will be 'is recorded by us . 'For this purpose . 'You are to be our servant . ' Alan . - How do you feel ? - Oh. fantastic What about your instruments ? - Did they indicate anything ? - No. not a thing . There was the light . Just kept getting brighter . - It 's crazy. a force field of light . - That 's exactly what it was . - Lucky for me Morrow brought us in . - Morrow ? You 'd switched on to manual . He didn 't land your ship for you . You were at the controls . Me ? No . I was in never-never land . - Get some rest . - Commander ? Where 's Donovan ? The anti-gravity screen will neutralise the force field . It 'll make a sort of tunnel . Or corridor . That will allow you to pass through and land . John ? I heard you . But when we hit that light barrier anything can happen . All set . Parks ? - I assigned Parks to this mission . - Yeah . But we changed places . Besides . I know the way . - Have they gone ? - Just lifting off . Turn on anti-gravity shields . 50 % power . Range 1-0-0 . Stay on manual . Very good. sir . - Scanner reading ? - ' You 're clear . Commander . ' - Anti-gravity shield full power . - ' It 's too soon . John . ' Velocity 7.5 . Range 5-0 . Range ... 3-5 . Velocity 8.3 Velocity ... 8.5 Victor. it 's working . We 're getting through . They 've reversed the force field . Carter. cut the engine . Cut the engines ! Got to switch it ... to automatic . Carter. cut the engines ! Alan ! - Sandra. anything ? - No visual or audio contact . - How long now ? - A minute five . They are coming back ! - Any audio ? - No. sir . Commander Koenig ? - Do you have them on automatic ? - Yes . - Can you get them down ? - I 'm switching to remote control . Eagle 1 under Main Mission control . Eagle 1 touch down . Paul ! Quick ! The scanner is picking up another object . - What is it ? - No idea . I feel fine . Bob . Really . I do . I 'm sure you do . Why do doctors make the worst patients ? Probably because we know too much . Blood pressure 's normal . 8 over 120 . Bone marrow count. sugar ... Everything checks out . - You all right ? - I just ... felt faint for a moment . My equilibrium 's off . - Did you check my middle ear ? - Yes. it 's perfect . Wait a minute . How many do you see ? Two . I should see four . Did you check my optic nerve ? Bob. tell me . Well . I can 't explain it . But from all indications ... you 're blind . - Well. obviously she 's not blind . - Obviously . Do you have any explanation ? Only one . Ted Clifford . Ah ! Another interesting account in the Pyramid texts of the old kingdom . But here. they 're called The Eyes Of Heaven . Seems our friends get about a bit . I talked to them . I told them ... we meant them no harm . And that we needed their help . - You saw them ? - I only spoke to them . To a voice . We know one thing about them . They can decompose atoms . Reduce an object to its atomical components. pure energy . Transport it through space and reassemble it in another place . That 's how they got you from here to there . We 've been working on that for years . With machines . They do it with light . Yes. but what sort of light ... and how ? When I was in the sphere . I wasn 't wearing my spacesuit . Oxygen . The Tritonians might just be humanoid . John . They 've activated her . She must be going to Computer . Notify Paul . No one 's to stop her . Paul . Bergman here . 'This is Main Mission Control to all sections . 'Attention all personnel . Do not approach Dr Russell . 'Repeat. do not approach Dr Russell . ' Don 't touch her. nobody touch her . What 's the computer transmitting ? Memory cell 371 . The breakdown of our life-support systems . - Can 't you stop it ? - Only if we stop her . The computer 's not transmitting . Helena is . Now as it is. she has 132 hours . That 's five and a half days . That gives us some time . They exhaust the memory cells . What then ? They won 't need any of us . They don 't need any of us now . Then why don 't they come and get it over with ? Perhaps they can 't leave their sphere . That 's it . Something 's preventing them . They 're limited in some way . A weakness . Everything they 've done has only shown their advanced intelligence . No one 's actually seen them . Not even Helena . We 've been thinking of them as people . What if they 're not ? Simply an intelligence with no physical form ? - They 're just as trapped as we are . - No . More so . We can move. we can get to them . We can 't blast through their force field . Maybe we can bend it a little . There it is . Commander . That ball of light . Just like Ted Clifford . Except it 's stronger. more alive . The same with her cerebrum and her optic nerve . Once Dr Russell is activated this ball of light enables her to see. well . Like a high-speed camera . They needed her there to implant it . That 's why it didn 't work on Ted . It 's their link . Through Helena . They 're connected to our computer . A human conductor . Commander. she can 't take much more . What do they want from us really ? Information . Our knowledge. that 's all . They 're a sort of ... reconnaissance team . Sent out into space to gather information and transmit it back to Triton . That 's all . We did it ourselves with our Deep Space probe ships . Then Triton does exist ? No . DID exist . The position of this mythological planet ... does correspond to our ... galaxy charts . I 've checked it myself a dozen times . Even through a computer . But Triton is dead . John . Blew up. disintegrated . It 's possible whoever programmed Helena and killed Ted . Doesn 't know their planet no longer exists . If I convince them their mission is obsolete. they may release her . Unfortunately . We 're running out of time . Helena 's been activated six times in the last 24 hours . She 's not going to survive another five and a half days . They 've miscalculated on their weakest link . She 's not their weakest link . Victor . The circuit runs from their computers ... to the force field ... around us ... to Helena . - To Kano ... - And back to their computers . Right . So it 's all up to Kano to jam Computer . We can 't touch Helena but we can break the chain . - You 've tested it ? - Once. but it worked . When I jammed it. the force field was off for 3.2 seconds . You won 't even get off the ground . I 'll need at least 15 minutes . 13 minutes 10 seconds from lift off to getting the force field . Which won 't be there . - And you can get me 13 minutes ? - Plus 10 seconds . It 's easy . Three keys locked together isn 't the same as locking them all . When Kano was experimenting he only jammed one circuit . He 's set up enough memory cells to cause an overload in 25 key circuits . It 'll take Computer 32 seconds to clear each circuit . Which will give us the time we need . 13 minutes . When the computer jams . The force field will shut down long enough for me to get through . Even if it works . What can you do when you get there ? - How will you get inside the sphere ? - The same way you did . Helena ... I don 't think they know their planet no longer exists . If I can convince them of that . They may release you . But there 's no time pattern . I 'm activated at random . Helena. please ? Victor and Kano have worked out the details . We need you to go through with it . I don 't have any choice. do I ? 'Standby . The moment Dr Russell is reactivated. we lift off . ' Commander . Dr Russell 's been reactivated . Lift off . Force field 8-0 . 7-0 ... 6-0 . 'Force field 4-0 . ' - ' How are we on time ? ' - Any moment now . 'Now . Kano ! ' Visual contact lost . Commander Koenig ? Commander ? This is Main Mission. come in . Eagle 1 here . - We 're inside the sphere . - They 're through . Naturally . - Is it over ? - Not yet . You 'll be reactivated in a few minutes . But. for the last time . Paul. information on Triton is in place . Dr Russell. now you can only transmit what we want them to know . - Computers set. sir . - Right. standby . I was never one to turn down an invitation . - Neither was I. - No . Carter . Stay with the ship . If we 're not back in 10 minutes . 15 at the most . You blast out of here . Right. sir . You won 't need that . All right . Get ready . 'Welcome . Commander Koenig . ' Where are you ? 'We regret the deaths of Clifford and Donovan . ' Sure you do . Why don 't you show yourselves ? 'We are here . ' - Surely I 'm no threat to you ? - ' That is correct . Commander . ' You knew we 'd jam our computer . 'That is correct . Commander . 'We have been watching Earthmen for many of your Earth centuries . 'We find them a very primitive intelligence . 'We could easily have prevented you from leaving your base . ' But you need me . Dr Russell will not live long enough . I 'm to replace her . 'The death of Dr Russell is also regrettable. but necessary . ' 'If we 're so primitive . Why seek our knowledge ? ' 'For when Earthmen decide to invade our planet . ' Triton is two million light years away . 'Time is an illusion . Commander Koenig . ' Not to us and not to you . Because your planet no longer exists . I can prove it . Right. standby . 'We do not wish to destroy your men . Commander. or you . 'We will if it is necessary . ' It won 't be necessary . I can prove to you that Triton no longer exists . Victor . She 's sending the computations now . This is Triton 's galaxy . Do you acknowledge ? 'We acknowledge . ' This is Triton 's star system . 'We acknowledge . ' This is Triton 's universe . 'We acknowledge . ' This is Triton 's sun . 'We acknowledge . ' The calculations you see now are coming through Dr Russell . You can check them . - They will prove ... - ' No longer ... ' - ... your sun exploded. that Triton ... - ' .. functional . ' Triton no longer exists ! Your function is discontinued . Release Dr Russell . 'No longer functional . 'Destroy ... Destroy . 'De ... stroy . Destroy ... De ... ' 'De ... De ... Destroy ... ' Follow me. this way ! What are you waiting for ? Come on ! Ready for lift off . Let 's get out of here. move it . - So far. so good . You all right ? - Yes . - John ? - We don 't know if he got out . - The sphere is breaking up . - What about the force field ? - It 's lost its power . - Visual contact . Just want to satisfy my curiosity . - What is it ? - You have a lovely optic nerve . Thank you . Dr Mathias . Why so pensive . Victor ? Oh . I was just thinking about that planet . Triton . All that knowledge ... and yet ... Perhaps knowledge isn 't the answer after all . Then what is ?

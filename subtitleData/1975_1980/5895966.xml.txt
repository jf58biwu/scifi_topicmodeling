 They 're going to end up killing each other . Hey , Starbuck ! You can 't believe Starbuck did this ? Lieutenant Starbuck to the brig ... - The brig ? - It 's the law . I 'm sorry . They 're gonna convict me . Adama will send vipers after you ! Then what ? Fire on Sheba or Boomer or me ? If I have to , yes . 'Our scouts have sent back word of yet another planet 'along the coordinates given us by our mysterious super race . ' More and more often , the planets we come across bear signs of the lost 13th tribe . We are getting closer to Earth . And once we have plotted her precise location , we will carefully formulate a plan for observing and sampling her culture . Too sudden an appearance from their relations in space could send our sister world into a wave of culture shock from which she might never recover . And are the inhabitants of Earth far in advance of us in their development or merely primitive animals fallen from a greater time ? I feel we will soon know . Oh ! It appears to this commentator that Ortega rib-blocked Starbuck after the score . The officiator couldn 't see it . How would you call it ? I don 't like to second-guess an officiator but Ortega likes to play to the limit of the rules . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Every time Starbuck plays against Ortega , his body ends up black and blue the next morning . Oh ? Well , as a med tech , I usually end up patching him up . - Oh , I see . - Sheba ! Ever since the academy , they 've been at each other 's throat . If it wasn 't gambling , it was women and now it 's triad . Starbuck can handle himself . Maybe , but they 're going to end up killing each other . Yaah ! Anything else , gentlemen ? I 'm going off duty soon . Does Ortega always play this way ? He 's a very aggressive type . Hates to lose at anything . It 's an asset in a viper but in triad ... Sure you don 't want to watch at the court ? It 's just a short walk . But these seats are more comfortable and we have good Ambrosa and good company . - Huh ? - Yes , of course . 'Cheap shot by Ortega ! ' Ortega , unnecessary blocking after the score . Starbuck , free shot . The officiator caught that one . Ortega didn 't even attempt to hide it . Your friend 's asking for it . What friend ? I fly with him because I 'm assigned . I play with him because he wins . That ties the score . And it could cost Ortega the game . One more like that , Zed , and he 'll be out of this game . Ortega , rib-blocking after the score . Out of the game . Starbuck , fighting , out of the game . What ? It 's the rules . You let him get to you . Now take a turbo wash and cool off . I 'll kill him . - Where are you going ? - I recognise that look on Starbuck 's face . - What do you want ? - A few centons with you alone . - You got it ! - That 's enough ! - Stay out of this . - Why ? So you can fight ? I said stay out of it ! If you touch each other , I 'll put you both on report . You 'll be grounded for a secton . - You wouldn 't do that . - Try me . All right , Starbuck , we 'll finish this another time , when your woman is not around . - You only delayed the inevitable . - Act your age . Just stay away from him . - You 're asking a lot . - I 'm gonna ask a lot more . I 'll be in the docking lounge . The next Galactica Shuttle is in ten centons . I want you to be on it or don 't try and see me later . That 's hardly time to wash and dress ! Or fight . 'They dive for the sphere . Vargas has it . 'He sends a high , spinning deflection to Parem . 'Barton bodychecks him into the wall . He 's a little groggy . ' I knew it would come to this . Score blue . Hey , Starbuck ! Why aren 't you playing ? I got a wager on you . - Yeah , that 's it ! - ' Barton bodychecks him into the wall . 'He 's a little groggy . ' You know , if we left now , we could avoid the crowd . Adama , the game 's tied . Oh . Oh . You 're on time . The shuttle isn 't . They announced it 'd be late . I hope it won 't be long . The sooner I get out of here the better . One laser blast to the heart . He was dead before he started to fall . Ortega 's laser hasn 't been fired . - Who discovered the body ? - I did . - What 's your name ? - Chella . - What were you doing here ? - I work here . I 'd just got off shift and wanted to catch the end of the game . Did you see anyone else here ? Yes . Starbuck . He ran around the corner . I was wondering why . - Starbuck ? - Yes . He almost knocked me down . Colonel , find Starbuck and run a routine check on his laser . One moment , Colonel . Father , you can 't believe Starbuck did this ? What I believe is unimportant . Everyone saw what was going on between Starbuck and Ortega and Starbuck was seen running away . The sooner his laser is checked , the sooner he 'll be cleared . You 're right . May I look for him ? Of course . Colonel , Captain Apollo will find Starbuck . - Count me in , sir . - Let 's go . - You 're being axfully quiet . - I 'm sorry . My head is still back in the game . 'Galactica Shuttle ready for boarding . ' Maybe I can take your mind off it when we get back . Hey , Starbuck ! Don 't tell me , we won - or rather , you won . - Ortega 's been killed . - Ah ... What ? - How ? - A laser . Someone saw you running , Starbuck . Sure , to catch this shuttle . What 's that got to do with ... ? Wait , you don 't think I had anything to do with it ? No , but we have to check your laser . Apollo ! It 's just procedure . It 'd be the same for me or anybody else . Come on , buddy . I don 't believe this . Neither do I. It 's been fired . Of course I fired it , I was on the laser range today . So were Jolly and Greenbean and no one 's accusing them . Starbuck , no one is accusing you . We 're trying to clear you . Did you fully recharge your laser when you left the range ? Of course , it 's procedure ! Commander . You all know our Chief Opposer , Sire Solon . Just socially . And I 'd like to keep it that way . So would I , but my position may dictate otherwise . So Dr Wilker is doing a laseronics ergon test on the termination weapon ? It 's not the termination weapon ! It 's my weapon . - Starbuck ! - No , no . He 's quite right . It wasn 't a very tactful way of stating it . My apologies , Lieutenant . I 'm ready . This is a laseronic ergon scan taken from Ortega 's body . When I put it here , it shows the laser energy absorbed by his body when Ortega was shot . 683.947182 ergons . Therefore , the termination weapon would be minus exactly the same number of ergons . To see if the termination weapon and Starbuck 's are the same , put it in here to see if we have a match . But that 's impossible ! I wish this test weren 't so precise , at least there 'd be some doubt . Your weapon terminated Ortega . Somebody set me up ! Lieutenant Starbuck , it 's my duty to charge you with the termination of Wing Sergeant Ortega . No ! You gotta believe me . I ... - Somebody used my laser . - It 's the only logical explanation . The Chief Opposer can proceed only on the evidence available . You know Starbuck as well as you know me . He could never kill in cold blood . Adama , if I may . After viewing tapes of the game and taking into account Ortega 's drawn laser , I would accept a plea of self-defence . Forget it ! I didn 't kill Ortega , not in self-defence or any other way . Don 't answer so quickly . If you plead self-defence you 'd be dropped by the Colonial Service but only receive a suspended sentence . If proven guilty of premeditated human termination , you 'll spend your life on the prison barge . I will not plead self-defence for something I didn 't do . As you wish . Lieutenant Starbuck , I must ask you to enter a plea . - I assume it 's not guilty . - That 's right . Security . Escort Lieutenant Starbuck to the brig ... - The brig ? - .. to await tribunal . It 's the law , I 'm sorry . I want to defend him . Captain , you don 't have enough experience . The evidence against Starbuck is strong . He 's right . You 've studied the codes at the academy but you graduated a warrior , not a protector . I believe him . That may not be enough to defend a man 's life . It 's good enough for me . Very well . Request granted . But Captain Apollo , I want you to remember , the law states specifically , tribunal must convene in ten centares . You don 't have much time . We 've been in tighter spots . - We have ? - We 'll get out of this one too . I told you , I flew with him because I was assigned . But you know who he associated with . He was a loner , Captain . Except on the Rising Star . Try the dealer at table three . Ortega gambled there and won big . I saw him there with some people I don 't know . - Anyone want to kill him ? - Anyone who met him . Take your pick . Rising Star . Captain ! Captain . We were on a deep probe once . It gets lonely , even Ortega talked . I told him to change or someone would kill him before the Cylons did . He laughed and said only one person in the fleet had nerve enough to try . - Who ? - Something like Karim ... No , Karim , Karib ... Karibdis . That was it . - Where do we find him ? - Sorry , just know the name . - Thanks , Sergeant . - Hope you find him . So do we . At least now we have a name . Could be all we need . The computer should have the rest . - Captain , what can I do for you , sir ? - The fleet personnel computer . If you 'll both log in , station one is open . - Lieutenant Boomer . - Captain Apollo . These computers get more complicated every yahren . But Dr Wilker makes them simpler to operate . Simpler to you , maybe , but it doesn 't look like anything at the academy . Sure you can operate it ? It does take a bit of advanced knowledge , Boomer . 'Yes ? ' Full profile on Karibdis . K-A-R-I-B-D-I-S . Status and location first . 'There is no profile on anyone named Karibdis , K-A-R-I-B-D-I-S . ' - Maybe you misspelled it . - ' Or on any name spelled like Karibdis . ' Do you think Barton lied ? 'To answer that question I would have to know what Barton ... ' - I wasn 't speaking to you . - ' Sorry . ' That 's all right . I mean , that 's all . Thank you . 'You 're welcome . ' This may be modern but give me the old-fashioned keyboard and print-out . This 'll drive you crazy . Barton had no reason to lie . Maybe he just got the wrong name . - No , he seemed pretty sure . - What now ? We check the dealer on the Rising Star . It 's all we 've got . An experienced protector would 've advised Starbuck to plead self-defence but this is Apollo 's first case and he has great faith in his friend 's word . Admirable but very foolish in light of the overwhelming evidence against him . Would you say that you do not believe he has a chance for acquittal ? - He has a slim one . - Can you tell us what that is ? Commander Adama , who , as you know , sits at the tribunal . Most of us are aware that Starbuck is like a son to him , and some might question his impartiality . But since I have brought the subject up on this interview , I think even with Adama on the tribunal , the case must be decided on the evidence alone . 'And even Captain Apollo will agree that under those conditions , 'Lieutenant Starbuck will be found guilty . ' He 's got me convicted before I 've been heard ! That 's just typical opposer rhetoric . Why isn 't Apollo being interviewed ? Why isn 't he defending me ? He 's preparing to defend you before the tribunal ... No , he 's not there because he doesn 't have a defence ! And he isn 't going to have one for the tribunal . Cass ... they 're gonna convict me . Starbuck ... it 's not too late to change your plea to self-defence . - I didn 't do it . - I know . But you could spend the rest of your life on the prison barge . You 're not sure I didn 't do it . Starbuck ... I love you . And if you say you didn 't do it , I believe you . Ah . Ahh . Don 't you see ? You , Apollo , Boomer , even the Commander , you all want to believe me but you still have your ... doubts . That tribunal isn 't being made up of my closest friends . So then you will change your plea to self-defence , even if you didn 't do it ? I don 't know . I don 't know . No matter what , I love you . I love you , too . I just need some time to think . OK . 'With the tribunal only a few centares away , 'it would seem to this reporter that , barring a miracle , 'the brilliant career of Lieutenant Starbuck will pass into history . ' Something 's wrong with my scanner . - I 'll call a video tech . - They 're talking about my case now ! - What 's the trouble ? - I don 't know . It 's ... You , drop it ! Drop it ! Get inside . - Where are you going to go ? - Move ! All right , can I have your security key ? - Stay out or I 'll fire ! - It 's me ! - Stay where you are . - Is that any way to talk to your protector ? - I 'll hurt you if you try and stop me . - I won 't stop you . I just want to talk . - That 's close enough to talk . - OK . OK . - Where are you gonna go ? - I don 't know . I 'll find a planet . Someplace . Any place but the prison barge . - I know you didn 't do it . - You 're not on the tribunal . - You have no faith in me . - In you , yes . The tribunal , no . Get off . Adama will send vipers after you ! I 'll deal with that then . Then what ? Fire on Sheba or Boomer or me ? If I have to , yes . Now , get off . You don 't have the guts to do that . Or the guts to face that tribunal ! I didn 't kill Ortega ! Then trust me ! Give me the chance to prove it ! You 've had your say , now get off . Or I 'll take you down that launch tube with me . OK . But I never thought I 'd see Starbuck run from anything ! I thought you were gonna do it . I almost did . - I 'm glad you found him before security . - So am I. I want a postponement . I need more time . I cannot grant that . I 'm sorry . By law , in a case like this , tribunal must be convened within ten centares . - You have less than two left . - But Commander , we ... We have to talk to Ortega 's acquaintances . - We have to find someone called Karibdis . - Karibdis ? - You know him ? - I know of him . And so do you - under the codename Proteus . - Proteus . - Baltar 's pilot and electronics expert . The saboteur of the defence computers the night the Cylons attacked ? His treachery was responsible for the death of a million Capricans . But I don 't see how could he have been involved in Ortega 's death . He was killed in the first Cylon attack wave . - Are you sure ? - I remember it being reported . Who can be sure of anything that night ? Then it is possible that he 's alive and aboard this fleet . If he is , he 's under a cover . And I , for one , would love to get my hands on him . - I 'll have Colonel Tigh start a check . - Sir , could you identify him ? No , I never met him . I don 't even know of any survivors who might 've known him . I do . Karibdis . Hm ... Yes , the name is familiar . But what can Karibdis have to do with Starbuck ? You must have quite a grapevine here . We believe Karibdis is aboard this fleet . You believe ? Ah . Then you don 't have him . And you need me to identify him ? Something to do with Starbuck 's defence ? I believe Karibdis killed Ortega . Very well . I 'll do it . - You will ? - Of course . Do you think me a fool ? I 'll point out Karibdis for you ... for a price . - Your release from the prison barge . - Bright lad . You 'll go far . - You know we can 't do that . - I know no such thing . But if you 'd come to me for help , Apollo , I believe you 'd do anything . Guard ! Let us out ! Think about it , Apollo . There 's more than one prisoner who 'd love to have Starbuck here . He won 't live long enough to reach his cell ! - 80 centons until the tribunal convenes . - What do you want me to do , give up ? I 'm sorry , Boomer . Forget it , Apollo . Forget it . Maybe we 'll get lucky on the Rising Star . Starbuck always did . Funny how saving him may come down to a pyramid dealer . - Table three is in the corner . - Hope this isn 't another dead end . I don 't think so . Look . The man who found Ortega 's body . - Coincidence ? - I wouldn 't bet on it . Capstone , no winners . We want a word with you , Chella . I gave my testimony in the deposition to Solon . - Excuse me , I 'm on duty . - Not any more . Why didn 't you tell them Ortega often played at your table ? And often left a big winner . - A lot of people play at my table . - But only one was killed . I don 't remember him playing . Funny , for a pyramid dealer who has to keep track of all the cards , you have a very poor memory . It 's not getting any better with you pressing me . It won 't have to . We 'll take you to the Galactica and check a memory that recalls everything . - What 's that supposed to mean ? - Personnel computer . We 'll also look at how much table three has lost and to whom . Let 's go . That won 't be necessary . I 'll tell you . You 'll find out anyway . I 'm not in the computer . My name isn 't Chella . It 's really Rifkis . I used to be Chief Administrator of Solius . 'The night the Cylons attacked , I did a terrible thing . 'I didn 't set out to , I was just trying to survive . 'I stayed as long as I could but I realised Caprica was doomed 'and so was anyone who didn 't escape . 'I was to be evacuated on a Gemonese freighter . 'I ran to it , watching the death around me , 'but I became frightened . 'Finally , I reached my destination but my freighter had left . 'I panicked . I had nowhere to turn . 'I thought I was as good as dead . 'Then I spotted the only ship left - the Rising Star . 'I knew it was my only hope . ' Sorry , children and nursery attendants only . I 'm the Chief Administrator . I must get off Caprica . - I have my orders ! - I 'll do anything ! Cubits . I have cubits . Here . There are over 8,000 here . That should be more than enough . - Hardly . - Please take it . I 'll get you more . Let me aboard . I promise . I swear ! All right . 'So he let me aboard . ' And because of it , a child was left behind to perish . I don 't know how you found me but in a way I 'm glad . The memory of that dead child will live with me forever . But at least I won 't have the fear of being caught any more . - What do you think ? - I think we 've found Ortega 's killer . You think I killed Ortega to stop him talking ? No . Because he knew who you really are . So what ? He knew who the other two really are . - Other two ? - Elias and Pallon . They got aboard the same way . He was blackmailing both of them . - Why did you tell ' em ? - They were accusing me of murder . If they knew Ortega was blackmailing me , they 'd find out about you . - You involve us to save yourself ? - Hold it . He 's right . They would have found out we 're all onboard under an alias . We mustn 't get trapped into getting accused of something we didn 't do . Hm ? I assume neither of you killed Ortega . - I didn 't . - I wanted to but I didn 't . And neither did I. So Apollo can only prove we 're onboard the Rising Star illegally . We might get punished but we won 't spend our lives on the prison barge . You 're right . We know Starbuck killed Ortega . I saw him running . You said that in all your depositions . Say that if you have to testify . The truth . We 've barely enough time to dock and make the tribunal . Do you think one of them killed Ortega ? - Yes . - Which one ? - Karibdis . - Karibdis ? It 's the only thing that makes sense . Ortega told Barton only one man would kill him - Karibdis . The people he was blackmailing live under aliases . One of them has to be Karibdis . Aren 't you reaching just a bit ? Maybe , but all three of those men are tied to Ortega , all three were on Caprica and all three got aboard the Rising Star using aliases . I could be wrong but it 's Starbuck 's only chance . But how do we find out which one ? Take over the controls , I 'll show you . I 'll keep my mike open . Here comes Apollo . Like I told you , stay calm . Look , I want to apologise for accusing you . We just got word that Ortega 's killer 's been identified . - Who ? - A man called Karibdis . - Who 's Karibdis ? - A traitor who caused millions of deaths . He was thought to be dead . Ortega knew he was here and was blackmailing him , too . Karibdis had more to lose if he was caught than you did . - You found him ? - No , but somebody can identify him . His old commander , Baltar . As soon as we dock , I 'm going back to the prison barge . We 'll find this Karibdis . I 'm really sorry I put you through all this . Then we 're free to go back to the Rising Star ? Yes . You 'll probably get off with a light sentence . - Captain , thank you . - Yeah . - I 'm glad your friend Starbuck is innocent . - So am I. - If one of them 's Karibdis , you 're a target . - I 'm counting on it . When we dock , head straight for that tribunal . Tell the launch crew I want those three left alone . So Karibdis can slip back onboard and kill you . You 're crazy . He 'll wait until I 've got Baltar . He 'll try to kill him too - he 's the only person alive that can identify him . He 'll try it on the way back . - Apollo ... - I 'll keep Alpha channel open . Maybe he 'll give himself away - admit that he killed Ortega . Before he kills you . You have to get that tribunal to listen to Alpha channel . Great . If it works , Starbuck is free . You 're dead . Don 't give up on me yet . How are you going to take on Karibdis and Baltar alone on this shuttle ? I 'm not . Baltar 's going to be on my side . 'Canaris Shuttle arriving at station Gamma , 'port landing bay , in three centons . 'Medical Shuttle ready for departure from starboard landing bay . 'All arriving civilian passengers 'must clear security before attending the tribunal . 'Security stations three , four and five are now open .

Lieutenant Boomer . - Where is the protector ? - Temporarily detained , sir . I will act as protector if there are no protests . Objection ? Objection ? - You 've never defended anyone . - Neither has Apollo . - Where is he ? - Out trying to save your life . This is highly irregular . However , if there are no objections ... Lieutenant Starbuck , will you accept Lieutenant Boomer as your protector ? - Yes , sir . - Opposer ? - No protest . - Very well . This tribunal is convened . The case against Lieutenant Starbuck will now commence . Opposer Solon . Esteemed members of the tribunal , as my first piece of documentation , look at your scanner , where the computapes for the final centons of the last game between the accused and Flight Sergeant Ortega will be displayed . Boomer , what are you doing ? Just trust me , Starbuck . Apollo said that and he isn 't even here . 'Galactica Shuttle requesting launch clearance . ' I knew that sooner or later you 'd come to your senses and decide to release me . - I decided to let you live . - Live ? 'Stand by , Galactica Shuttle . Traffic ahead of you . ' Only two people could positively identify Karibdis . Ortega and you . He 's already killed Ortega . You 're a wonder , Captain . Instead of offering me freedom to identify Karibdis , you offer me my life . - How touching . - It 's your only chance . You mean Lieutenant Starbuck 's only chance . True , but your instinct for survival is stronger than your desire to see Starbuck wrongly convicted . You must think me a fool . The affection Karibdis had for me was that of a son for a father . He would never be a threat to my life . Then why is he on this shuttle ? I don 't believe you . If he were on this shuttle , it would only be for one reason - to kill you . You 're right , first . Then he 'll kill you with my laser . It 'll look like we both killed each other . How would he explain that I did this while wearing shackles ? He 'll remove them . After you 're dead . 'Galactica Shuttle , launch when ready . ' Launching . What did he say ? Uh ... I can 't remember . You can 't remember what the man you have a relationship with said ? Just a centon ! I mean , he ... the opposer ... I mean , the opposer has not proved that such a relationship exists . Not quite properly protested but allowed . My apologies . Cassiopeia , do you have a relationship with the defendant ? We 're friends . - How close ? - Very close . Then you will tell the tribunal what your very close friend said after Ortega left for his dressing quarters . The witness will answer the question . He ... he said ... that I was only delaying the inevitable . If the tribunal pleases , that concludes the opposition . You 're wrong , Apollo . We 're nearly there and nothing 's happened . No one 's aboard this shuttle but us . Why are you sweating ? - Karibdis . - Commander Baltar . Good to see you again , sir . I will ask the question again . Is the protector ready to defend ? Commander , our defence is on Alpha channel . - I protest . - Upheld . Will the opposer and the protector please approach the tribunal ? In the name of the Lords of Kobol , what is going on ? More importantly , where is Captain Apollo ? On Alpha channel , sir , with our defence . You leave this tribunal no choice but to make a decision . Sir , by the Lords of Kobol , listen ! 'Release these shackles . ' 'Once you activate the automatic pilot . 'It 's that green button . ' Karibdis , I order you to release these shackles now . As soon as you turn on the automatic pilot and I dispose of Captain Apollo . 'Like you disposed of Ortega ? ' 'Terminating Ortega was easy . 'You 've become a much more dangerous opponent . 'Your laser , Captain . ' Turn on the automatic pilot , Baltar . Gently , Captain . Boomer , did the tribunal hear that ? We have it . Are you all right ? 'Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'll be docking in a few centons . 'Call a med tech and security . I had to knock out Pallon - or , rather , Karibdis . ' Apollo ... Thanks . I owe you my life . Don 't thank me , thank Baltar . He saved both of us . But he 's not very thrilled about it . Starbuck , would you slow down ? You 're making me tired . Would you save it for the game ? Sorry , I 've got all this excess energy from being locked up . They ought to lock you up more often . It 's OK . You 're gonna be wonderful , OK ? - I know . - So do I. I 've put a wager on you and Apollo as an added incentive . That 's great . I can see a very bleak evening ahead . Well , that 's us . Good luck .

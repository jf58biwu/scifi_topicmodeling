 ( Beeping ) That 's it . Alan , cut the alarm . A day to remember . 'It 's a boy ! 'Mother and son doing just fine . 'Seven pounds , eleven ounces . Dark hair , blue eyes . 'He 's beautiful . ' - We made it . - I like that . - A boy , I knew it . - Knew what ? - It 'd be a boy . - You bet it would be a girl . - Never . - You did . ( Laugh ) Hey , Sandra . What 's the matter ? I 'm ... I 'm happy ! - Are there any complications ? - None whatsoever . But I do think someone should watch him at all times . Now , you get some rest . I 'll do the first stint . I 'm not tired . I just don 't want to leave him anyway . Sue , he 's perfect . Just get some sleep . You 'll see him again later . Thank you , Dr Russell . ( Beeping ) ( Scream ) ( Sue screams ) My baby . What happened to my baby ? Take it easy , Sue . We 've had to sedate her . She 's in shock . Well , well . Hello , young man . He 's gotta be five years old . - Uh-huh . - What happened ? I don 't know . This whole thing is beyond normal medical experience . How can cell growth accelerate to this extent in a matter of seconds ? Cells just don 't grow without nourishment . It 's impossible . Heaven knows I looked forward to this first child born here . ( Commander ) Helena , we knew there could be a problem . Yes , psychological problems , medical problems , things we could deal with , but this ? What kind of life will this child have anyway in this artificial atmosphere on Alpha ? He doesn 't even have a father to help him cope . Wait a minute . That could have something to do with it . But Jack Crawford died seven months ago , Commander . I know . He spent all of his working hours in here . But the place was torn apart when he died . There was no radiation leakage . Is there something wrong with the baby ? Yes . And I 'm going to find out why . 'Commander , preliminary tests show he is a perfectly normal 'five-year-old child . ' Five ? ! Maybe we had no right to expect it to be normal . You mean we can never expect to have normal children ? It 's this crazy life we lead . Nobody really knows how it 's affecting us physically . Not long term . Come on . Life here 's not that abnormal . We eat , sleep , drink . Even breathe air of a kind . Now , possibly there 's something specific about this particular case . Like Jack Crawford 's death . They 've already called Computer for data in the generating area . It seems the Commander has re-opened the enquiry into Jack 's death . Yeah . Well , he 'll have to do something . His brain activity is what you 'd expect of a five-year-old . And his motor activity 's on an equal level . But he 's not communicating . No . How could he ? He 's had no opportunity to learn to speak . Yet he 's so alert , so responsive . There 's one thing we haven 't tried yet . ( Clash ) A deaf-mute . 0ur first concern is how we 're gonna look after him . Yeah . I 'll give Sue all the help she needs . I think we 've got to give him the best chance we can . So we try to give him as normal a life as possible . Maybe we 'll find out why it happened this way . Maybe we 'll never know . - John ? - Yeah ? He 's a lovely child . What did Computer have to say about Jack Crawford ? No new facts , no new answers . It seems ... ( Footsteps ) What 's your name ? We 've called him Jackie . Jackie , huh ? How 'd you like to come flying with me ? We 'll take an Eagle and we 'll soar into space . He can 't hear , Alan . He 's deaf . We 'll just have to show him , won 't we ? Come on , away we go . Hey ! Ready for landing , little one ? ( Laughter ) Well done . Enjoy your flight , Commander ? Splendid uniform you 've got . He 's cute , isn 't he ? Look at this . ( Beep ) Commander Koenig , we have a visitor . - Well , what 's going on out here ? - A new commander , I think . ( Laughter ) Hello , Jackie . Hello . Kano , let 's show Jackie something pretty . Come on , Jackie . Here we go . Ups-a-daisy . All right . Want to see a pretty picture , Jackie ? Watch . See that ? Here 's another one . You want to try ? Here , press this button . It 's just too much excitement . I just think he 's tired , John . There now . Just look at that . Isn 't that a lovely thing ? Now , then . You know what that 's called ? That 's called a flo ... wer . You think you can say that ? ( Jackie mouths ) Flower . What is it ? ( Mouths ) Very good ! Top of the class . Now , let 's see if we can find you another one . Something even more beautiful than that . Then we 'll get you to draw something . That 's marvellous drawing . Get a pencil and make a few marks on a piece of paper . And suddenly , there you are . You 've got the most lovely flower that you 've made all by yourself . Well , who 's his father 's son , then ? My , you 're doing well , aren 't you ? His weight feels good . ( Helena ) 38 pounds . He 's making normal progress now . ( Woman ) Finding out about us ? Your father knew everything about this powerhouse . You going to follow in his footsteps ? He looks bright enough . ( Helena ) I keep inventing intelligence tests for him . ( Laughs ) Now , lift off . She refuses to recover from her state of shock . She 's totally rejected the child . I suppose that 's an understandable reaction . Everyone else on Alpha has welcomed him with open arms . She won 't even see him . If she could see what a comparatively normal life he 's leading ... It 's the manner of his growth that 's so disturbing . I must admit , I can 't accept him either . Hello ! You 've done it already ? That 's very good . Would you like to draw some more ? Yeah ? All right . 0ff you go . It 's extraordinary . ( Beep ) ( Beep ) ( Beep ) ( Chuckles ) Well , he 's certainly making good progress . 0h , yes . He 's bright enough all right . And as far as I can tell , he 's a perfectly normal kid . Is he , Victor ? All our enquiring minds have become charmed with young Jackie . - He 's still under observation ? - He 's gotta be . Jackie , can I see your drawing ? Hmm . He senses you 're not as willing to be charmed as the rest of us are . ( Radio ) ' Commander . ' Yes , Paul . 'Could you come to main mission ? ' Be right there . Scanner shows something heading straight for us . - It 's moving fast . - Kano ? - Nothing yet from Computer . - Let 's see it on the screen . Red alert . ( Carter ) Where did that come from ? ( Morrow ) It 's heading for the north quadrant . ( Benes ) Confirmed . - You know what you 've got to do . - What if I 'm attacked ? Don 't wait for me to give the order . Hey , I 'll see you later . Huh ? Hey , what 's up ? I 'll be back . Keep sending on all frequencies . 0pen all channels for any response from them . ( Koenig ) ' Any sign of activity ? ' Nothing . Except a green light . No movement , just hanging there . ( Koenig ) ' Hang in there with them and report the first sign of life . ' Right . Moving in a little closer . I 'll let you know if they fire . It 's made of some kind of alloy - composition unknown . It 's 100 metres in diameter , 40 metres high , yet if has very low density . There 's room for an army inside . Some form of life is indicated , but not human . Without previous experience , Computer cannot identify it . They could blast us at any moment without warning . Maybe they 're waiting for us to move first . However you look at it , it 's suspicious . If they are friendly , why don 't they say so ? Alan 's very close . I think we should move first . 'I have them lined up . - ' Laser charge is at maximum rate . ' - ( Morrow ) Better safe than sorry . Alan , return to base . Why ? They could have assumed you were the aggressor , blasted you out of the sky . But they didn 't . Maybe they 've got what they want by keeping quiet . But we 're wide open . Let 's put ourselves in their shoes . When we make a reconnaissance flight to a planet , do we intend to attack ? We try to communicate as best we can . Let 's assume on that ship are friendly , peaceful people , trying to make contact with us . But for some reason we 're unable to talk , hear or understand each other . - I just don 't get that feeling . - Nor I. Ignorance is no reason to start shooting . After all , we 're ... all afraid of the unknown . Take Jackie Crawford , for example . I know you 've all accepted him , but I have some questions . I don 't know why he is like he is . I can 't explain it , nor do I understand it . But I 'm not about to shoot him . ( Screams ) Take him away ! Take him away ! He 's killing me ! ( Sobs ) ( Sue walls ) I saw him smile . It sent a shiver up my spine . So knowing . Almost as if he were mocking his mother to death . Where is he now ? With his nurse somewhere . Somewhere ? Paul , find Jackie Crawford and don 't let him out of your sight . Helena , we 've all tried our best to accept Jackie as normal , but he isn 't . He 's bright , all right ... Too bright . There 's something else . Just a feeling I have . Something I can 't explain . But I trust it . I think he 's fooled all of us . 'Commander , three more spaceships approaching . ' I think there 's a connection . It 's just a hunch . Helena , find Jackie Crawford . Confirmation on spaceships , Commander . Let 's see them . I want three Eagles to intercept those ships before they reach Alpha . - Shoot ? - No . - Just let them know we 're ready . - Right . ( Morrow ) They 've knocked out the cameras , Commander . ( Carter ) It 's an attack . - Alan , stop them . - Right . ( Koenig ) Red alert . ( Koenig ) Alan ? Carter ! Get moving . ( Morrow ) Cameras operating again , sir . Eagle leader to Alpha . Alien spaceships dead ahead . Alan , fire at will . Now you 're talking . Eagle leader to group , select on-board ranging , but with manual override . Manual override ? They 're moving very fast . I said manual override . Switch to main computer . Check and fire again . Manual check ... and fire . We can 't get a hit . Carter , turn around . Hit ' em from behind . ( Sighs ) Cell growth has accelerated far beyond the capacity of our instruments to measure . - Still increasing ? - Yes . What can we expect this time ? Helena , I think my hunch is right . It 's gotta be more than coincidence . The arrival of those spaceships and now this . You think Jackie ... You 've got to stop calling that Jackie . But rather some alien power amongst us , which sooner or later we may have to destroy . - John , it 's a human being . - Is it ? It has a human form , that 's all . We 're wide open . We 're past waiting to see what 'll happen . Then the reasons for your first decision still hold . We don 't know any more . We 're just more frightened , more desperate . Whatever that 's becoming threatens our existence here on Alpha . In that case , the reasons for not destroying him are even stronger . What do you mean ? You say we 're wide open . If he is their instrument , how do you think they 'll respond if we kill him ? I agree with Dr Russell . At the moment our hands are tied . With those things so close , we 're not going to get an Eagle off the pad . We couldn 't be sure we 'd hit them anyway . What happened out there , Alan ? - Well ... - Whatever caused that failure , it 's just conjecture . The fact is , you weren 't functioning properly . Actually , you were virtually incompetent . - I 'm not incompetent . - No , but you were out there . - It must have been my instruments . - Was it ? - What are you trying to say to me ? - Alan , I think you were gotten to somehow . By Jackie Crawford . - Jackie Crawford ? - That 's right . All this talk isn 't going to help us . But I do have an idea which ... might work . If activity on the alien ship stops soon , we might have a chance . - Like what ? - Well , it 's quite primitive . My idea is to send four men on the surface , on foot , each carrying hand-held , armour-piercing lasers . They position themselves under each of the alien ships . They coordinate and fire simultaneously straight up into the bellies of the ships . You said it was primitive . What else can we do ? The question is , who does the job ? We have no choice . It 's the four of us . ( Beep ) Ah ... ( Murmurs ) M ... Ah ... My ... name ... is ... Jarak . For as long as you know me , I shall retain this form . I require to know what has been happening during the period of my growth . There are many things we 'd like to know also . Has any action been taken against my spaceships ? None . I know the truth when I hear it . You will tell me , Dr Russell . ( Choking ) Stop ! Stop it , I 'll tell you . Stop it . - Quickly . - Stop it . I 'll tell you . There are four men on the surface . Stop it , please ! And now you will stop them . - I can 't stop them . - But you will . No ! ( Gasps ) ( Helena ) ' John , you must do what I tell you . 'Do not fire at those ships . 'You were right about Jackie . ' Hold your fire ! What 's the problem , Commander ? Back to the base . You 've killed her . Rena ! Helena . ( Softly ) Helena . Dr Russell . Put down your weapons . John , tell everybody to put down their weapons , or I 'll kill Alan . Thank you , Dr Russell . You are now released . You 're not Sue Crawford . No more than I am Jackie Crawford . No more than you are Commander of Moonbase Alpha . Like you , we are involuntary travellers through space . We are 120 souls in all . But unlike you , we are looking not only for a place to live , we are also looking for a physical form in which to conceal our identities . Why ? Running away from something ? I like the intuitive quality of your mind , Commander . I like the unpredictability of your human emotions . I like the differences between you people . But on our planet , we faced extermination because we were different . Yes , we are running away ... from genetic conformity rigorously imposed . We are so happy to have found Alpha . Jarak , listen to me . You can 't stay here . We can 't sustain more people . 0ur environment on Alpha is so precarious we can barely support ourselves . There will be no population increase on Alpha . We shall simply take over your bodies and make them our own . The moments of birth and death are ideally suited to this purpose . Jackie Crawford 's birth gave me my chance . But you killed Sue Crawford . Dr Russell , there will be no more births on Alpha . But sadly , there will be many more deaths . I was very happy with my birth . I wasn 't able to do much in an incubator , but as a five-year-old , you all made me the darling of the base , showed me everything I needed to know . I am sorry to have to bite the hand that fed me . Jarak ... You need us . I don 't know your people , but they need us alive . You won 't kill us until you 're ready . We are ready . Jarak ! ( Screams ) Don 't move . As Commander here , you have some particular value . It would be a waste to kill you before one of my people can make use of you . Your choice is between a future as one of us , or no future at all . 'This is Jarak . 'Listen . ' ( Jarak ) You have been selected as the first to die . You cannot resist . You are dying . The mission of my spaceships over Alpha is almost accomplished . ( Gasps ) My people are preparing to transfer themselves to those of your dying bodies that have been selected . When the transfer is complete , my spaceships will lift off to a safe distance and auto-destruct . 'The last material traces of our former life 'will be lost forever . 'We shall have exchanged our world for your moon . ' ( Chokes ) 'The designated will die . As far as our pursuers are concerned , we shall no longer exist . We shall have begun our new life as inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha . ( Gasps ) They 've found us ! Helena ! ( Coughing ) Everyone all right ? Everyone seems all right , Commander . Let 's find ' em ! Could be more . I 'll take care of them . Don 't be foolish , Doctor . ( In Koenig 's voice ) Computer , medical centre doors are to remain locked until this direct command order is rescinded . And now , Dr Mathias , I hope you will help us to persuade your commander to accept us . 0ne life for three hundred ? ( Beep ) ( Kano ) ' Alan , is the Commander with you ? ' Yes , Kano . 'According to Computer , you 're in the medical centre 'and have issued a command that the door is to remain locked . ' ( Beep ) 'Commander Koenig , 'we wish to negotiate . ' They 've got Dr Mathias and two nurses . Make your demands . 'Requests . We are no longer in a position to make demands . ' Then open the door . As a human being , Commander , your heart is full of resentment at my treatment of Alpha 's first mother and child . You just tried to kill all of us , Jarak ! It would have been a painless process of change . The combination of Alphan bodies and the minds of my people would have been splendid . 'The result would have been a great future for Alpha . ' And us ? You would have become part of us , but we have failed . The rest of my people have been discovered and destroyed . 0ur request is now a very modest one . That we should be allowed to become part of you . Jarak , you 've just killed a number of my people , you 're holding others captive . Commander , you chose to bargain with your life . 'It was not our purpose to destroy . 'Your people are only stunned . ' They 'll all recover . We have become human beings , and chose to translate our power into threats and actions humans could understand . 'We are now appealing to you as humans ourselves . ' Appealing for mercy . Commander , there is a gigantic spaceship . It has taken up position over Alpha Base . Pulsating green light as previous spacecraft . 'The people of our planet have found us , Commander . ' They will ... destroy us . They will destroy ... the whole of Alpha . 'Unless ... Unless what ? Jarak ! Are you going to let Alpha be destroyed because of you ? Jarak ! ( Beep ) ( Sandra ) 'Commander , pulsating has stopped . 'The spaceship is leaving . It 's going away . ' Jarak ! Mathias ! Alan . ( Sobbing ) They 're gone . D 'you think they gave themselves up ? It 's a nice thought , Helena . But I don 't think they had any choice .

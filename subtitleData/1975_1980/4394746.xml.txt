 ( EXCLAIMING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) Ever made hay before ? Not in the literal sense , no . Have you ? - When I was a child . - Ha ! EMMA : Come on , kids . Come on . Run . ( EXCLAIMING ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Glad you saved the cherries . We have cherry dumplings for supper . - JENNY : Oh ! - What have we got then ? Eggs , bird each , a loaf . Hey , Paul , give him a lift up , will you ? Go on . Come on here . Get your feet in there . Put your foot there . There , there you are . Now , climb over . - John , hang on to those , okay ? - Yeah . - I want to get on the horse . - You can 't . - But I want to . - Come on . You can go on this one . - There , you see ? - There he is . ( GRUNTS ) Up . ( ALL LAUGHING ) - Hey , Greg ! - Oh , oh , oh . Sorry , sorry . JENNY : ( LAUGHING ) There you are . - Right , come on . - ABBY : Hold tight . I say , Greg , I 've been looking at that river . I think it 's fast enough to run a water wheel . GREG : Yeah , we should probably do something in the winter there . If we can 't , we 'll think through . - Bye . - Bye-bye . LIZZIE : Bye . EMMA : Bye , Lizzie . JOHN : Bye . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) Vic . ( RATTLING DOORKNOB ) Vic , don 't you want your breakfast ? Vic , answer me , please . What 's the matter ? Answer . Vic ! That 's all the answer I got . And not a word to the children this morning . Oh , he has been getting quieter and quieter all along . Somehow getting more and more inside of himself . First , I put it to Barney , but that 's not the reason . No . It 's been getting worse ever since you brought him here . I never clocked he was that upset . ( SCOFFS ) You never see what 's under your nose as you 're too busy . - But I notice these things . - Yeah . Come on . ( RATTLING DOORKNOB ) Vic ? Vic , can you hear me ? Now , Vic , will you come on out , please ? ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Look , Vic , you know you can 't stay in there forever . Look , just come on out and we 'll talk it over , whatever 's bothering you . ( GUNSHOT ) ( GASPS ) Come on , Paul . ( GASPING ) Dead . He 's ... It 's all right . It just looks worse than it is . EMMA : I 'll get some water . He can see there 's always so much to do and he feels out of it . He does what he can and he does it well . It 's more than just a physical problem . He watched us all go off on a hayride today . A hayride ? I 've never felt so tired in my life . All right , it was work , but we made it a picnic . - Emma 's right . He feels left out . - Well , whose fault 's that ? Why doesn 't he come along ? What 's to stop him coming tomorrow ? You know very well . He would be just watching you work . Well , how lucky he is . ( CHUCKLES ) Finest pastime in the world , watching other people work . - This is serious , Arthur . - Do you think so ? If you ask me , it 's about time he stopped feeling sorry for himself . Well , how do you think you 'd feel if you were crippled ? You know , it would help if he had a proper chair . Emma , you can 't say we haven 't tried to get him one . ( SIGHS ) I can 't say that but I can say you haven 't tried hard enough . Now , hang about , we 've got a lot of other things to do , you know ? More important things . What 's more important than a man trying to kill himself ? - He didn 't try to kill himself . - EMMA : " He didn 't try " ? What ... Look , Emma , I don 't have to spell it out . If you really want to do it , you don 't miss . Exactly . You put the thing in your mouth . Yeah , all right , Arthur , thanks very much . He 's trying to draw attention to himself , that 's all . - I think he was asking for help . - He gets help . - Nobody here gets more . - That 's what I meant . Oh , come on . You can 't say he 's treated like a lame duck . EMMA : Ah , Jenny , did you bring it ? - What ? - The civet . Oh , Emma , I 'm so sorry . Oh , it 's all right . I 've finished for tonight . It was the children . They 're quarrelling again . I don 't know , I can 't seem to manage them nowadays . - They only listen to Vic . - CHARMIAN : How is he ? I don 't know . Abby 's with him now . You 're not tough enough with them . Anyway , let 's leave them behind tomorrow . They only get in the way . No , no , no , no , no . They 're not getting under my feet . Anyway , they should be in the fresh air . John is still coughing . - GREG : How is he ? - He 's all right . I think he wants to talk to you . ( SIGHS ) Yeah , all right . ABBY : Laura 's with him . ARTHUR : That 's nice for him . Oh , no , she 's much better . He 's taking her mind off things , helping her postnatal blues . EMMA : Postnatal blues , my foot ! ( SCOFFS ) It 's because we 're all spoiling her . Me , I never had time for postnatal blues . - Didn 't they take you ? - No . - Make up ? - All right . What shall we do ? I wish we had some books . These are just false fronts . They kept the beer behind there . We 've got doctor 's books for the baby . Do you think Jenny is going to have a baby ? I don 't know . What happened to you , Vic ? I told you . I had an accident . LIZZIE : Let 's play . - What at ? - I don 't know . Tell us a story about animals . Tell us what happened to you . Once , there was a tiger with good legs . There 's nothing there , except the farmer and his wife . At least I suppose it 's the farmer . We better go . - I 'm not getting in that thing again . - We can 't stay here . You can put up with the smell of that . Speak for yourself . Frankly , I 'm about ready for a change . I don 't care how bad it is . I 'll go and get something to eat . ANNE : And I 'm sick of eating out of tins ! And I 'm tired and I want a bath , and I want a drink ! Then why don 't you shut up ! Don 't you dare speak to me like that . There 's some woods over there . I 'll see if I can find something . ( SNIFFING ) Come on , Greg , this stink 's killing me . We 're supposed to be looking for a wheelchair . Yeah , yeah , yeah , I know . I just want to have a look at these . Come on , even if we can 't find a chair , we ought to concentrate on the garage . - Petrol 's the most important thing . - Is it ? Oh , come on , you 've got to be kidding . He 's teaching them reading and sums . What more do they want ? Yeah , well , I can teach them maths and physics and you can ... Yeah , well , what can you do ? I can read , for what it 's worth . Yeah , well , it may not be worth very much to you , but it 's important for the kids . Look , I know education shouldn 't just be sort of stuffing information into people , but that 's what our kids are gonna need , information . I mean , how to use ... How to make use of anything that 's left in the world . Everything 's written down . Everything 's in books . The key to the whole future is in libraries . You mean , they 're gonna finish up like we did . - Make the same mistakes ? - Well , they might . At least we can give them a choice , can 't we ? If you say so , but let 's come back in the winter . Yeah , but you 're missing the point . I 'm not just talking about the kids and the future , I 'm talking about Vic , solving his problem . - What do you mean ? - Look , what does he do ? What does he teach ? He teaches the kids simple arithmetic and reading , yeah ? Kids ' stuff . - Yeah . - And you 've already said that you think reading is pretty unimportant . ( SIGHS ) I don 't know . Yeah . All right , well , that 's what he thinks . I mean , he thinks it 's unimportant and because of that he thinks he himself is unimportant . So , we change it . Just convince him that because he 's the one who 's getting all the stuff from the books and feeding it into the kids , we just convince him that because of that he 's the most important person that we 've got in this settlement . Right . But he 's gonna take one hell of a lot of convincing . Greg ! ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) DONNY : Anne ! There 's some smoke over here . There must be some people . Come on . ( VEHICLE APPROACHING ) Greg ! We saw your smoke . Are you all right ? ANNE : We 're not sick , if that 's what you mean . We 've both had the illness . Are you on your own ? - Where did you come from ? - Taunton . We met there . - Where did you find that ? - Avonmouth . You come from there ? No , I was working on a trawler up in Yarmouth . I asked if you were alone . - No , I 'm not . - How many of you ? Eleven . We 're looking for people , people to join . Well , you 've found some . Couldn 't you find something smaller ? It 's over half-full . - You mean , of petrol ? - Yeah . Well ? I can do it . - Got brakes , hasn 't it ? - Yeah . ( GRUNTING ) Fine . Look , thanks for going into town . - It 's all right . - What are these books ? Well , I thought we could do with some more . Well , I suppose so . Not much of a reader myself . Well , it 's for the kids . Well , I thought they should be learning more than just reading and sums . I see . - Greg . - Yeah . I 'm not an educated man . Who is ? - PAUL : Hey , Greg ! - Yup ? Found you . - Oh , I like your wheelchair . - Yeah . Would you believe a tanker of petrol just arrived ? - A tanker ? - No kidding . A guy and a posh chick , I reckon they want to join . Told them to put it in the yard . Come and have a buthcer 's . New potatoes . We got them for our cabbages from people a few miles away and the peas . I 'm going to boil them in the pot . They are so nice . You ... You are not ill , are you ? No , but I would like to lie down . I am very tired . - Is there hot water ? - We have a copper , yes . But whatever you take out for your bath , you have to fill up with buckets . We are working on piped water , you know , but it has to wait its turn , I expect . There 's the haymaking and harvesting and all this . Buckets aren 't too bad . - I know . - I thought perhaps ... ( CHUCKLES ) Forgive me for asking , I was born to ask , you see . But I thought you are a person who had a rather nice life before all this . Am I right ? Yes , I had a nice life . Uh , where have you been ? I mean , now , where have you come from ? I was on a farm , but it wasn 't very well organised . Uh-huh . And I quarrelled with the people who ran it , and I needed some things from the town so I went on my own . - And Donny came with me . - Oh , I saw him through the window . A good , strong young man . Would it be possible for me to have some kind of a bath now ? All right , I 'll show you . - Hello , Anne . - Greg . You know each other ? Yes . - A long time ago . - Six months . - How are you ? - I 'm all right . We met when there was an accident in the quarry . - Mmm-hmm . - A tractor went over on a man . - He died . - He didn 't die . And he 's here . LIZZIE : Hey , what are these ? - No , put them away in the cupboard . - Notebooks . Put them away . Put them away ! Neatly . LIZZIE : Hey , put the rest of the ... JOHN : Put all these into this box . - And put them into ... - LIZZIE : Hey , what are these ? JOHN : Oh , there 's clips . LIZZIE : Gosh , pencils . Oh , put those up there . JOHN : No , the clips are up there . ( BOTH CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY ) Uh , right . Come over here . Come on . Now , what ... What does that say ? " Vic . " " Teacher . " ( CHUCKLES ) What 's two and two and two and two and two and two and two and two ? - What 's 100 and 100 ? - Two hundred . - Four 13 's are 52 . - Oh , that 's cheating . - That 's from playing cards . - It 's still numbers . What else besides playing cards do we need counting for ? Buying things . No . Measuring things . Except we don 't need to measure things anymore . Nothing . We don 't need counting . - Who were the Romans ? - They were people who came ... - Do we need to know ? - No . Tell us more about the tiger . The tiger . Well , he was a very smart fellow . He walked around the forest all day , enjoying himself . Talking to all the other animals . One day ? One day , they all got sick . So the tiger thought to himself , " All right , getting sick is what happens to other people . " He was never sick . Then the other animals ... Died ? Yes , they did . All his friends . So , he went and found a safe place in a quarry . And he stocked it up with everything that he could want . 'Cause he was good and strong . Strong legs . He never had any trouble . Then somebody came . Somebody came to give him company . Somebody to talk to , somebody to love . It was a beautiful ... snake . Now , you two , grab yourselves some food and we 'll be off . - Where are we going ? - It 's half a mile away . - A field of grass , we 're cutting it . - What are we cutting grass for ? To turn into hay . - Sit down and eat . I 'll call Vic ... - No ! - Greg . - Mmm-hmm ? - You say he 's in a wheelchair . - Yes . Can I go upstairs ? What 's the matter with everybody ? Sit down and eat . - ANNE : Donny . - We 've no time , Emma , We 've got to go . ANNE : Donny , please ! She can wait . - Emma . - Mmm-hmm ? I don 't want Vic to know that woman 's here . Come on . ( SIGHS ) We must make some beer . CHARMIAN : Oh , why ? 'Cause it 's more refreshing than milk , that 's why . - Oh . - Mmm , who 's that ? ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( LAUGHS ) This is Donny . This is Abby , Jenny , Arthur , Charmian . - Hello . - Hello . Donny , you tell ' em what 's been happening to you . Abby ? ( ALL CHATTERING ) He 's just arrived in a tanker full of petrol . What ? I don 't believe it ! Well , it 's true , and he wants to stay . ( CHUCKLES ) He 's welcome . Yeah , but there 's a problem . There 's a woman with him . So ? Well , it 's one who was with Vic at the quarry when he had his legs crushed . Do you mean , the one who left him ? Left him to die ? Mmm . - ( SIGHS ) Have they met , yet ? - No . But she knows he 's here . She 's gone upstairs where he can 't get at her . - Does he know ? - Not yet . And Donny knows nothing at all about it . Now , Vic 's waited a hell of a time just for this . Revenge ! It 's about the only thing that kept him going . Oh , she couldn 't have come at a worse time ! Hey , where you off to ? The other patch . Greg , that woman 's got to go . Yeah , but what about him ? We need him and that petrol 's absolutely priceless . ( SIGHS ) Yes , I know . We 've only heard Vic 's side of what happened . Maybe we should hear what she 's got to say first . Doesn 't matter what she says , I was there . She ... She just walked off and left him to die . Come on , you two ! Let 's get it done today . We 've wasted enough time . ( INAUDIBLE CHATTERING ) What 's he like ? Very nice . Let 's hope he stays . And there 's all his wonderful petrol . - His name 's Donny . - Hmm . Where 's he been ? I don 't know , didn 't have a chance to ask . - He brought a lady with him . - No ! Did he ? Yes . I met her . She was going to have a bath , but I don 't think she did . Did she go to make cake ? ( STAMMERING ) Uh ... I don 't know . Uh , I don 't know . You always think I know everything , I don 't . - What 's her name ? - Anne . JOHN : Can I have a go on your chair after , Vic ? Yes . - LIZZIE : Can I ? - Yeah . ( BLADE WHOOSHING ) The Prayer of the Little Ducks Who Went into the Ark . " Dear God " Give us a flood of water " Let it rain tomorrow and always " Give us plenty of little slugs and other luscious things to eat " Protect all folk who quack " And everyone who knows how to swim " Amen " Pick a poem , both of you . Write it down . ANNE : Donny ! Donny ? Donny ? Come up . Now ! It 's her ! Greg , it 's her voice ! It 's her ! I know it 's her . It 's her voice ! Look , I can 't stay here . ( SIGHS ) Well , that 's up to you . Could you keep him out of the way while I go down - and Donny and I get away ? - Yeah , I can do that . Look , I don 't know what 's going on . There 's no need to know . I can 't stay in the same place as that man ! There was something between you ? Yes ! - Are you going now ? - ANNE : Yes . Look , I could do with a rest . Anyway , he 's not going to come up here , is he ? And where are we gonna get to ? - Can 't you wait till the morning ? - No . You can take some food and go while we 're eating tonight . You 're Donny ? - Vic , is it ? - Yeah . - We 're gonna leave . - Why ? We need people like you . That 's the way it is . I 'd like to stay but ... Vic , she says she knows you . ( QUAVERING ) Look , I don 't know what happened between you two , but I like her . Anyway , she doesn 't want to meet you . No hard feelings . I mean , if you and she ... No hard feelings , eh ? Cheers . Well , we 'll grab something to eat and get off . ( GREG SIGHS ) Where is everybody ? GREG : Well , Abby and Jenny are with Laura and the baby . Where is Vic ? Excuse me . GREG : Vic ? Vic ? Food 's on the table . Where is she ? ( SIGHS ) Vic , will you listen to me ? Where is she ? Greg , where is she ? She 's upstairs and she 's going . She 's having a meal and then she 's leaving . Why ? Because it 's important that the people in this settlement can work together . Yes , but you need people , you need more people ... Yeah , well , I need people who can get on with each other ! ( SIGHS ) Greg , it 's ... It 's a long time ago . - I just want to see her ... - No ! Why should she eat upstairs and sneak away ? Why can 't we just talk to each other ? Come on , let 's go and eat . ( ALL CHATTERING ) VIC : Lizzie ? Lizzie ? Nip upstairs , tell Anne there 's a place for her at the table , will you ? You said you were leaving soon . Seems a shame , you don 't have to go , do you ? - No . - This is a good place . Very good . Oh , when the hay is finished , they 'll be scouting for grain to harvest . You ought to stay on ... - Oh , I ... - ... for a month or two , at least . - I 'd like to . - Yeah . Yeah , all right . So , I 'll see Anne , talk to her . Did you get it all cut today ? Yes , we did and raked too . Oh , good . Good . Know what I 've been doing today ? ( WHEELCHAIR CREAKS ) ( CHUCKLES ) Been practising this . How do you like it ? Great improvement . Tried to teach John and Lizzie something , couldn 't find anything worth teaching . Mrs Cohen teaches them how to cook , Abby and Jenny teach them how to burp a baby , the only thing I could have told them was how to drive a tractor , but I can 't do it . Do you know what I read in one of the schoolbooks today ? Westminster Abbey was opened in 1065 . ( SCOFFS ) Wonder what it 's like now . There 's a place , Anne . Hello . Hello , Vic . Give Anne some stew . I 've had mine . Let 's get it over with then . For those of you who don 't know the story , Anne , before the plague , was a rich brat . You can see she 's good looking . We met . ( SCOFFS ) I built a kind of fortress , which you know about because you found me there , in a quarry . Anne and I stayed there , I had my legs then . We loved each other , you know . I was moving stores about , she was playing with the tractor , just playing . She overturned it , I was underneath . I was her man , she ran away . Met Greg , came and did what he could with no equipment and he 's not a doctor . Before he came back , she left me . I was talking to her , she left me and told him I was dead because he was a better bet than me . I was left alone for four months . There she is . Is this true ? Yes . Vic ... Yes , Anne . I thought you were finished . If you 'd have been a horse or a dog , I 'd have shot you . Why didn 't you ? Look at me ! Will you do it now ? - You 're a human being ! - That 's enough of it ! You 're alive and what 's done is done . Anne 's leaving . Donny is welcome to stay if he likes . We 're all useful . Yeah , I 'll stay . Abby , that 's what I 'm saying , what 's done is done . I was just clearing things up . Now , why can 't she stay ? Everybody 's heard the story now . Here I am . That 's all . Do you want me to go now ? Alone , in the dark ? You can stay till morning . ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( WHEELCHAIR CLANKING ) ( WHEELCHAIR LOCK CLICKS ) ( EXHALES ) ( GRUNTING SOFTLY ) ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTING ) ( PANTING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( WHISPERING ) You want to kill me ? No . How can you kill me ? ( VIC BREATHING HEAVILY ) I want to live . Good . ( INHALES ) I want to live . I 'm going to live . I 'm sorry you didn 't die then . I 'm sorry for you now . ( GRUNTING ) I 'll use this ! Don 't mistake me , Vic ! I want to live . ( PANTING ) Do ... Do me a favour . Use it ! ( WHIMPERING ) Please . Use it . ( SOBBING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Sssh ! Don 't scream . ( GROANING ) I 've waited for you ! ( CHOKING ) Let go ... Vic ! Vic ! ( GASPING ) Don 't , Vic ! Please . ( CRYING ) It 's life , Vic . You 've got children to look after and children to teach . ( SOBBING ) You 've got more than me . I didn 't do wrong , I didn 't love you . I never loved anything or anyone but living . It 's living ! You 're braver . Yes . And you are real . It 's life , Vic . Life . It 's all that matters , to go on living . It 's life . Life . ( CRYING ) Life . Lizzie said , " God protect those who know how to swim . " And you 'll find the story about how to tell a real princess . She lies on a pile of mattresses like this . I 'm not . I was a kind of one once . ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) ( GRUNTS )

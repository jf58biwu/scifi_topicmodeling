 Heil Hitler ! - Heil Hitler ! What 's happening , gentlemen ? I hope you didn 't invite me over from Europe just for fun . We have a chance of winning the Second World War . We shall present the Fuehrer with the Hydrogen Bomb !

I agree . The travel bureau - that 's great idea . Our London papers are full of it ! Trips into the past , come and have a history lesson . That 's what I call an invention ! - Or a first-class flop , what ? - A flop ? Why ? - That the Americans didn 't invent it . The only airport for these rockets is in Prague . Mr. Karel Bures , pilot of the Universum Company , Prague . Please come in . Which line do you fly , Mr. Bures ? - The Secondary Era . In the folders we call it a visit with the dinosaurs . - Are you married ? - No , I live with my brother . We 're twins . - But ... Mr. Bures 's brother is one of the designers of this rocket . And he makes the test-flights . - Ah . And wherein will you collaboration Lie ? What 's that ? - The code which will be used to lock the rocket on the first of June . Although the rockets are locked from without so that nobody may climb out and interfere with history , we shall open the rocket with a reflected ray from the moon . We can do that . We know the code . The condition is a start on June the 1st . We shall buy the whole rocket for ourselves . Listen , is it really possible to land in a certain year , on a certain day , with that rocket ? - And at a certain spot ? - We 've calculated it all . Here , with the engineer . After all , this gentleman is a rocket pilot too . We shall land in the near vicinity of the Fuehrer 's Headquarters on December 8th , 1944 . I know the place , I was in command of an execution unit at the time . - Heavens , how old were you at the time ? - Just a moment ... Today I 'm eighty-six , that means that at the time I was ... thirty-four , gentlemen . - So you 're going on for ninety too , Klaus ? ! - Gentlemen , it 's really lucky we have this . - And it costs something , too . - Thank God , otherwise anybody could buy it . Long live the anti-aging pills ! - Bring Mr. Kraus in . - I got married for the sixth time last year . And the lady thinks I 'm only sixty-two ! What on earth is this ? - Mr. Kraus is flying with us . One never knows what could happen ... - So there 'll be three of you in the rocket ? - Yes , Mr. Bauer , me and Kraus . - Permit me ... on June 1st at 6.30 a.m. Our employee will be waiting in the Universum hall . He will bring the uniforms . The password is : Suits should hang in closets . The answer : Put them where they belong , then . - And what about the bomb ? - It 's in the museum right now , but we 'll have it by then , documentation included . Kraus ! Don 't forget ! June the 1st at 6.30 a.m. In the hall ! - Of course , but first I want an advance . - Hab die Ehre ! I want an advance payment too , gentlemen ! See to it , will you . And now let 's see your plan . - It 's quite simple really . A cybernetic worked it out , and this is it : We shall be arriving in Prague by plane on May 31st at 14 hours 15 minutes . There will be three rooms reserved for us at the Atlantic . Amongst our personal luggage there 'll be a suitcase with the hydrogen bomb . We shall spend our leisure-time individually like run-of-the-mill tourists sight-seeing . I heard that there 's plenty to see in Prague . Kraus will hire a car , some inconspicuous , on dish style . 1st JUNE Air hostess in Kalasiris Flight 22 for Egypt . Please follow me . Today is the first of June , and June is the last month for our regular trips called The Fall of the Bastille . We would like to draw all parents attention to the special cheap prices of the expeditions into the past meant for school-children . In the cycle Moments of Drama we can offer The Battle of Lipany , A Knights ' Tournament at Kost Castle and The National Theatre Fire . If I 'm not wrong , suits should hang in closets . - Hm . Put them where they belong , then ! Well ? Oh ... it 's you , is it ? So that the suits are hanging in the closets ? Bravo ! The main thing is that everything 's going well . John ! John ! Got a pill ? - Yeah . ... the socialist countries , ensuring the success of the World Peace Conference . Washington : The theft of the nuclear bomb which took place a week ago at the Military Museum in Washington is still being investigated . There is grave suspicion that the thieves will try to misuse the stolen exhibit . - The bastards ! Ah ! - That 's the end of the news . What on earth 's happening ? - Oh ... I scalded myself . Look ... - Old clumsy ... Couldn 't happen to me . - I 've never seen you cook breakfast , old boy , either ! What 's the matter with you ? Got out of bed with your left foot ? I must talk to you , Charles ! Who 's preventing you ? If you have enough money for parties , you could pay the rent for a change ... I 've been paying it for months . - Why not , I 'll pay it a year in advance if you like . Have you borrowed money again ? - No ! But you 'd do better to tell me what you wanted . Rousek called yesterday . - Hm . - He 's had just about enough of those affaires of yours . I you don 't leave the Universum girls alone , he 'll chuck you out . - Is that all ? - That 's enough , isn 't it ? And if you 're in money , pay back that debt to the Kroupas . If you don 't mean to marry Eva ... - You can say that again , I certainly don 't ! - Charles , you know how much she loves you ? ! - Hm ... - How happy I could be with Eva . - Hm ! - And anyway ... I 'd be a happy man just being you ! Flying about the way you do ... I 'd just love to give up the research institute ... To make an end to my everlasting Ioneliness ! I 'd put Eva on a pedestal ! - Yes , but then you 're such a good old idiot , John ! If you feel so sorry for her , marry her yourself ! Her and that family of comedians of hers ! It is June the first , 7 hours Have you finished , Charles ? Charles ? Charles , what 's the matter ? What 's the matter with you , for God 's sake ? - Sorry ! - That 's all right . Oh no , Donald , calm down ! Calm down ! Good doggie , come along . Doctor , please , quickly ! - Right . - I couldn 't get through to you , your line was busy . Please , hurry , it 's a matter of seconds . Suffocation . Your brother is dead , Mr. Bures . I 'd try some resuscitation , but it 's too late for that . He suffocated . Choked on a roll . I 'm afraid there 's nothing at all I can do . Except write out the death certificate . Excuse me which of you two has actually died ? Bures . Eva ! Eva dear ! I have a very sad thing to tell you . Mummy ! Mummy ! - What is it ? - Quickly , something 's happened to Charles ! Let me see ! Hello ! Hello ! This is Mrs. Kroupa . What ... This is Bures . Mrs. Kroupa ... You 'll drive poor Evie out of her mind ! Do please tell us that Charles is all right , or she 'll jump off the terrace ! For God 's sake , no . No ! Do get her calm ! Tell her that ... Charles ... - Well , what 's happened ? Charles ... Charles is all right , ... It 's John . Poor John . He 's suffocated on a roll . Oh dear ... Such a nice boy . We 're terribly sorry to hear that ... Mr. Bures , do come over for lunch , you can 't stay there all alone . There . That 's it . I 'm very sorry . Well ? Is there anything wrong ? Ah ! The date of birth is missing , isn 't it ... When were you born ? - I ? - I mean , when was your brother born ? But as twins you have the same date of birth . Ah . There . So now everything is done . Goodbye . It 's just that it 's such an odd feeling to see it black on white ... - I know . ... that I 'm dead . I don 't like you look of Bures ! He doesn 't care at all about our movement . - You 'd better check on him . There 's plenty of time . This is Abard . Is that Charles Bures ? - This is ... Yes . This is Charles Bures . We 're in Prague . Are the suits in the closet ? Of course ! The suits are in the closet . And what about the armchairs ? All right ? - Absolutely . So that everything 's O.K. Thanks . That 's all right . You see , it 's all working beautifully . - He only does it for the money . - Exactly . I know this is a great loss for the Research Institute for Rocket Motors . You see , I happen to know how much John loved his work . Even though he did miss flying at times . Thank you . Hello , Charles ! Charlie , are you coming in for a poker game on Wednesday ? - A poker game ? - Hm . - Oh , a poker game . Yes , I 'll be there . - But you could let me have the hundred you lost last time , and I mean now . - A hundred ? - Yes . - Yeah ? - The landing of the expedition to the Battle of Waterloo . Arrivals hall number eight . - Can you please tell me where I can lodge a complaint ? - Complaint . Complaint ... there . - Yes . Thank you . - What 's it about , Charles ? - I 'm looking for where I can lodge a complaint . - Oh , not to the right , please . To the left , the second door . This gentleman will have his little joke . Shame on you , making fun of an old lady ! - No , I ... - Come with me ! I have to tell you something . Give me a cigarette ! - I don 't smoke . - You don 't say , since when ? Yesterday you were still a chain-smoker . And how have you done your hair today ? Charles , listen , Robert knows we were together last night . See ! Robert said this time he 'd beat you up for sure . And do you know how he said it ? That he 'd leave a hole in your mug just right for a thermometer . That 's what he said . I think it would be best if we stopped meeting . - Charles ! You don 't mean that seriously ? I want a divorce from Robert ! You know what we 'd arranged ... ! Give your darling Margaret a kiss ! Give your darling Margaret a kiss ! Come on , Charlie ... How dare you ? Mrs. Nolova , please come to my room again with those flies , we have a mistake there somewhere . - Yes , Mr. Rousek . I 've told you at least a hundred times to stop these doings of yours ! You needn 't be surprised if I decide to draw consequences . I spoke to your brother yesterday . Yes , we talked about it . I mean ... my brother ! My brother died this morning . - Good grief , what happened to him ? He choked on a roll . - I see . I 'm very sorry indeed . Now my boy you no longer have anybody to pull you out of the soup , to get you out of trouble every time ... - Don 't you worry , I 'm going to change . I 'm going to be really different from now on . I promise . - I know . You 'll behave as you should for half an hour and then you 'll be in asking for a day off . - No ! Well ... actually ... I would need a day off . I have to talk to my brother 's fiancee ... I mean to my fiancee . - I see . - Thank you . At what time do I start , anyway ? I 've clean forgotten ... At fourteen ten . Buy some roses , Mister ! Roses ! Seven . Seven , for luck . - Not only for you , for me too . Mr. Bures ... Excuse me . Eva ! - Charles ! Charles ! I 'm so sorry about your loss . Er ... what are you doing ? We have a premiere in a week 's time ... ! But can 't you see , Mr. Bures is here . I see ... I 'm so sorry ... - I hear he was such a good boy . - Poor John ! - She 's been crying like this since this morning . She 's much too sensitive . I don 't know what she 'd do , were anything to happen to you ! - Hm , hm . D 'you know what ? Come and have a drink , an aperitif . In honour of your brother , right ? Lunch will be ready soon anyway . Hey there , call a break ! Hop ! - Just a moment , Sir ! I 'd just like to settle one small thing . - Yes . Thank you . - How much do I owe you ? - All of fifty thousand . - I see . - But just a moment , sorry . But if I understand right ... - Understand what ? - Eva will be so happy ! You see , you told me you 'd give me back my money one week before the wedding . Eva ! Eva ! Come here ! Eva ! Eva ... it looks like you 're getting married in a week 's time ! - Charles ! Darling ! I 'm so happy . We 'll begin a new life . It 's certainly begun for me ! 1st JUNE We apologize to our passengers . The flight to Alexander the Great is three seconds late . Well and ? I 've paid for a sight-seeing tour , so I have the right to see something , don 't I ? There . And where 's that guy ? - He 's over there . Excursion number fourteen - in the footsteps of Julius Caesar . Regular departure Wednesdays at 9 a.m. Please . - Your gallant little ways are not a thing I care for , Mr. Bures . Anyway , after what you were impertinent enough to do to me during the Ruin of Pompey trip , this is my last flight with you , Sir . Captain ! There 's somebody waiting for you at bar number 1 . CREWS Did you call me ? - You 've guessed right , my boy ... ! Is he blind , or what ? What 'll you have , Charlie-boy ? He 's nuts , if you ask me . - On the contrary , he 's playing it up beautifully ! - Mr. Bures ! This is your suitcase , unless I am much mistaken . - Yes ! Yes , this belongs to my ... I mean to me . Thank you . Gentlemen , that man is great ! I think we are in good hands . Give my love to the dinosaurs ! And what about this ? - Ah ! - Hi , Charlie-boy ! Permit me to flap a flapper at you . - Ouch . - What a pity you are just starting . I would like to talk to you . About Marketa ... - But ... your wife and I ... That 's all over . I swear ! It 's over ! - Charlie , I happen to know you ... Tomorrow , then . Get a set of false teeth ready ! Pardon ? Teeth ! A set of false teeth ! CHECK CHANGING ROOMS Line twenty-seven - antiquity - the secondary era ! To the cloakrooms , please . Bag-check here , please . That 's all right , Captain , run along . Shirley , where have you been ? - Patrick , don 't make me nervous , will you ? - I don 't think that can be done , Shirley . - May I ? - Thank you . Captain ! The starter ! - Ah , yes ! Hello , Charles . - Hello . - No problems . Want to link up the starter ? - Ehm . - Well , give it to me then , man ! - Ah ! - What about this suitcase ? - I don 't know . The old sot ! Here , Helena . - Thanks . And now the Whites ! - There are only three of us , we 've booked the whole rocket ! - You 're wrong ! You only booked eight seats . Two have been taken by these passengers . - Excuse me . - That is OK . - Thank you . - But you 'll have plenty of room , anyway . Our rockets are extremely comfortable , not like the old types . I 'll kill that guy Bures ! You 'll find your bags by your seats . Do you need this case ? - No thanks . Not now . - Take it away please , will you ? I 'm going to complain ! - I 'm sorry , it must have been some error in the booking . What can I get you ? - Nothing , no thanks . - We have our tickets , we 're going to fly . Do you mean to make me angry , by any chance , Sir ? A computer error . These Americans have valid tickets and yet this gentleman maintains that ... You 've messed it up ! Me ? - The Captain has nothing to do with this . Kindly get ready for the start ! - I don 't know how to apologize for that Pompey affair , Helena Machova , but I really am very sorry . - Surely you don 't want to convince me you 've turned into a gentleman overnight ? This is exactly how I always imagined a real pilot would look . Line twenty-seven - R-K-M boarding finished . Controls all working . Entrance blocked . I request permission to start . R-K-M - start ! Bon voyage , Charles ! Our love to the dinosaurs ! End of over-pressure . Patrick , how is it done that we go back into the past ? - To tell you the truth , I haven 't the faintest , Shirley . I should say leave it to this company who arranges the sprees . Firstly he made a mush of booking the tickets . Secondly - he was to have invited us into the cabin right after the start wasn 't he ? We must act ! We have a few minutes left ! - Miss ! Excuse me . Yes ? - Kindly tell the Captain that I 'd like to visit him in his cabin . - You are Mr. Abard , are you not ? - Yes , Abard . Captain ! One of the passengers would like to see you , Mr. Abard . Please explain that passengers are not admitted to the control cabin during the flight . Helena , could you please get me a cup of coffee ? Of course . Excuse me . Well gentlemen , we can pack up . Don 't be crazy ! And get ready ! Here 's your coffee , Captain . - Coffee ? Coffee can wait . Stay as you are , Bures ! - What is this supposed to mean , Bures ? We 'd arranged that you would invite us into the control cabin ! - What ? When was that arranged ? - Stop trying to be funny , damn you ! - Just a moment , Kraus . Don 't you think he 's behaving rather oddly ? A real hold-up , Patrick . Isn 't it fantastic ? If you think so , Shirley . How about explaining what all this is about , gentlemen ? - Can you understand it ? - Perfectly . You want to ruin our plan ! - But we happen to need you ! Kraus ! - Yes . Thank you . - Don 't waste that ! For God 's sake , do something ! Can you manage ? I hope so ... - And now the uniforms . They 're supposed to be hidden in the luggage section . If that guy didn 't put them in ... I 'm sorry , ladies and gentlemen , but we have to change the program of our excursion trip . - What is that supposed to mean , Sir ? - For the time being only that we are landing , now . - Fasten your seat belts and stop smoking ! You 've certainly managed the uniforms perfectly . How come you stopped co-operating afterwards ? And now the negative . Come on . If you haven 't got it , start writing your last will and testament . - But ... I think I do have some ... - We have the code . You can open the rocket . Gentlemen ! We can now step into the past . I 'm sure looking forward to seeing von Braun again . He wouldn 't have dreamt of this . - You 'd better get dressed first , or you 'll freeze ! - And there 's no hurry , gentlemen . I have the anti-aging pills with me . I took a big supply . What are you doing ? - Without the starter not even the Lord himself can manage to get this thing away ... Dear friends , we are now in the year 1944 . When you step out , it will be into the furious theatre of war . Take care of yourselves ! Armies are not usually gallant . - Particularly when they see a figure such as this ! - How dare you ? ! An odd man , this Bures . That 's all right ! This way ! He behaved marvellously ! Would you be capable of just that , Patrick ? - I 'm not so sure , Shirley . Well , Captain ? Hm . The starter 's gone . There 's nothing I can do . We were supposed to have gone to see the dinosaurs . - When I tell my friends in Chicago ... - If we do ever get back to Chicago ... How come they behaved as if you were their accomplice ? - That 's ... that 's as much a mystery to me as it is to you . - Do you know , Captain , that you seem a different man today . You remind me of your brother . He was on the commission of the flight tests . I did like him . Suddenly you seem like ... to be like him ... You 're just imagining . Actually , my brother died this morning . He choked on a roll . Is there anything I can do for you , Sturmbannfuehrer ? What day is it today , Admiral ? - December 8th . So it worked ! Kindly get out . The driver too . - I beg your pardon ? - Quickly ! - I 'm on my way to the Fuehrer with an important mission and you don 't have the slightest right to act this way ... Oh , come on now ... ! You should get a new photograph for your pass , Sturmbannfuehrer . You look like a little boy on it . - Don 't you think you 're being rather impertinent , Untersturmfuehrer ? - I apologize ! The Japanese attacked Hawaii yesterday . - The base is called P Pearl Harbour . American navy losses are unimaginable . - Meine Herren , that 's colossal . Our allies have proclaimed war on the United States with a fantastic action . That 's simply colossal ! Steinberger ! Get me Mussolini ! I want to share my joy with him . - Yes , mein Fuehrer ! - Victory is now at hand , gentlemen . We have destroyed Poland , defeated Norway , Denmark , conquered Belgium , Holland , France . We have knocked the whole of the Balkans to their knees ! We are the masters of Europe and are now standing before the gates of Moscow ! Tomorrow we shall proclaim war on America and together with Japan we shall defeat the USA . In a few days Providence will have made me the ruler of the whole world ! Today is my happy day , gentlemen ! Gentlemen , the Fuehrer will receive you . - Yes ? - But you must wait a little . I 'm afraid my trick isn 't going to work , gentlemen . I have only fifteen minutes left . This is me ! Look at me , this is me ! My ladies ... - At the time I was fulfilling important duties in the interests of the Reich . There were many of these duties ! Sometimes I really didn 't know where to start ... Excuse me , Miss , but you don 't keep the place very warm , do you ... - I 'm afraid we cannot shut the main entrance . We must save energy because we don 't know what 's in store for us here . - Considering we paid such a lot of money , surely we could see something of that war , couldn 't we ? It would be exciting , wouldn 't it , Patrick ? In its way , yes , certainly , Shirley . Walkyrie twenty-eight ... - German command calling . At ten zero five Admiral Wolf drove through the check-point . - They must have a date here with Abard . ... for the Great German Reich to achieve total victory on all fronts within the next few weeks ! What are we going to do ? Wait . - Aren 't you hungry ? - No . You don 't want any anti-aging pills , either ? Not yet . Why is your hand bandaged ? I scalded myself with tea this morning . - Don 't worry ! It 'll be all right , Helena . Gentlemen , the Fuehrer is expecting you ! - At last ! I can just about make it ! Sturmbannfuehrer Klaus Abard with aide . The gentlemen have a pressing report to make . Heil Hitler ! Steinberger , get me Admiral Wolf ! The U-boats are waiting , he should have been here by now . - Yes , mein Fuehrer ! Well , what is it ? Mein Fuehrer ! We have come to save the Great German Reich at the last minute ! From what ? From unconditional surrender which now threatens Germany . Steinberger ! Throw him out , degrade him , arrest him and so on ! You 're lucky I 'm in a good mood today . Otherwise you 'd be going straight to the firing-wall ! - Just a moment , Mein Fuehrer . Just a moment , please ! I would like to demonstrate something , mein Fuehrer . It is December 8th today , is it not ? Eleven hours twenty-seven . In exactly three minutes you will receive a call from General Henkel from the eastern front , and he will report that the Soviet Army has captured the Polish city of Rzepin , less than a hundred kilometres from Berlin . Then you will understand that I do not guess at the future , that I know it . In less than three minutes ! We can all start counting . Steinberger ! Damn you to hell , can 't you see this man is crazy ? ! Sturmbannfuehrer ! - Just a moment ! Two more minutes and five seconds . - Why don 't you read the newspapers now and then , Sturmbannfuehere ? Why should we retreat to Berlin , when we stand before Moscow ? ! - Pardon ? - I mismanaged the landing . We 've arrived three years earlier . - Please - this is not , 44 " ? - No . - Christ ! Mein Fuehrer ! They 've brought in Admiral Wolf . What do you mean - , brought in " ? Wow ... ! What happened , doctor ? They found him in the forest . The driver , too . His pulse is normal . I wanted to straighten his legs ... ... but one of the broke off . He is moving his lips a little , but it 's difficult to understand him . - These ... three ... Attacked ... me ... - These three ? - Yes ... - Carry him out ! What have you done to him ? ! - What a fuss ... It 'll pass soon ... If that idiot hadn 't broken off his leg , he 'd have been all right by now . - Take them away ! - No ! First find out who they are and how they got here ! - A rocket has landed ! Americans ! - A rocket ? Americans ? Bring them in ! This is crazy ! The U-boats are waiting for my orders ! Oh look , Patrick , that 's Hitler ! It 's Hitler ! You wait when I tell them all this in Chicago ... Pat dear , you must take my picture with him ! Put your arms round me like this , will you ? Oh , you 're here too , are you ? Look here , lady , kindly ignore us , will you . What ? You know them ? It could be put that way . - It 's a gang of spies ! - Himmler ! This is the limit ! Arrest them ! Take them away . Shoot them ! - How dare you ? - It seems to me you 're exaggerating things , Mr. Hitler ! We are American citizens . - Mein Fuehrer , there 'll be unpleasant results to such an incident . We still have diplomatic contacts with them . - You settle the matter , then . Himmelhergot ! This isn 't the way to conduct a world war ! There ... Arrest these Americans ! - I 'm a German ! - All the worse for you ! Shoot them ! And how about this young lady ? - Arrest her . Yes , Sir . Yes , Marshal . Mein Fuehrer . I 'd like to explain . This young man - is me ! I see . I left the biggest surprise till the end . Here is a weapon which will allow you to achieve your victory in a single day . You 'll win the Second World War in a single second ! This is the hydrogen bomb , latest type , the size of a hand grenade , with documentation complete . Look ! I 'm going to kill that Bures guy ! Me ? This is my suitcase ! How dare you ? - Shirley ! - Patty ! Himmler ! Before the execution ... torture them torture them torture them ! - Take them away . - Torture them ! - Forward ! Get you gone ! Clear off ! - Torture them ! - Patrick ! Leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! Patrick ! Now watch out ! - He 's got a bomb , mein Fuehrer ! Down ! Take cover ! - Not a bomb , it 's my last surprise . Sound the alarm ! - Silence ! Without us - you 'll come to this sticky end ! Well ? ! No ! No ! It 's not true ! Never ! Never ! Never ! What are you doing ? Let me go ! I have a mission to fulfil ! - Out ! - Mein Fuehrer ! That was proof ! - Out ! Out ! Out ... you too , Himmler ! Everybody out ! I don 't want to see anybody ! Get out of here , Bormann ! Everybody out ! Well , you certainly weren 't strong on manners . History was right in that ! - We shall complain ! We wanted to see the dinosaurs ! Helena ! Helena ! In with you ! Stop ! Helena ! - Stop ! - Where are you taking her ? - Captain ! No ! No ! Never ! Providence would never permit that ! No ! No ! We shall win ! We will win ! We will win ! I beg to report that I found this in the cabin of that er ... aeroplane . - Orders were not to touch anything before the special unit arrives . You idiot . This a devil 's machine ! Take cover ! His documents ! Klaus Abard . That 's a joke ... Except that it 's true . You 're having yourself executed , you idiot ! Don 't you understand ? - Well , that 's enough . Do you have a last wish ? - Yes . Promise me that one year after the war you will not go to the Bodensee in summer . I got a severe bout of sciatica there . You 'd suffer like hell for five years ! - I see . Calm down . We have some very special suffering in store for you here , and now ! At the personal wish of the Fuehrer himself ! No ! No ! No ! What are you doing ? What are you doing , you fools ? - Come with us ! - I wanted to save you ! I wanted to save the Third Reich ! - Halt ! - No ! Why did I let you talk me into this ... ? ! - Yes ! Yes ! - This is awful . And it was all planned out so beautifully ! - Well ... ! - Look it 's nearly off ! - And so what ? Are you going to fight them with a tooth-pick , or what ? It 's all this idiot 's fault ! - Who ? Me ? How can one die without at least venting one 's fury on this calf ? What 's this ? Instead of preparing your souls for the Lord , you stand here kicking at each other ? You go first , as punishment ! Take everything out of your pockets ! What 's this ? Well ... A gentleman 's perfume ... or something ? Could you at least lock the door , considering your hands are free ? Go on , you 're scared , man ! You shit-ass ! Watch it ! The door ! - Come on ! Quickly ! - Open up ! - And lock it ! Hands ! Hurry up ! Your coats ! And what about Helena ? We can 't leave her here ! - Shut up , then ! Be careful ! Left , left , left , two , three , four . Left , left ... I 'm not leaving Helena here ! - Come on , Bauer , let 's leave him to it . With such an ... - What if I don 't manage to start the rocket ? - Well , that 's true . Damn you , man , come on ! Get in ! Got aboard or I 'll shoot ! Oh ! We 've got the grenades ! - What ? - The grenades ! - Give me a couple ! Come on ! See ? They 're waiting , the bastards . Take cover ! Halt ! Halt ! The starter ! Give me the starter ! Come on ! I 'm frozen stiff . I 'm hoarse too , dammit ! Can 't you heat these things properly ? - We 'll all be sick . Poor Abard . He couldn 't have known it would come to this end . - Well , we 'll have to decide what to do with Bures . - Hm , he 's a dangerous witness . What 's going on now ? ! Bures ! You haven 't started off yet ! What 's happening ? - This is R-K-M calling . May I taxi to the ramp ? - Yes . Number six is free . We 'll open you up in a moment . We 're busy just now . What do we need to wait for ? The rocket 's unlocked , isn 't it ? It won 't be open here till later . Come along , I 'll take you to the cloakroom . I 'd stopped hoping it would end up like this . - You 'd better not count you chicken-x . Come on ! - Quickly ! I hope you will help yourselves , though this is not the rule . I 'm going to change . - No , no , don 't go away ! You can change here ! You 've caught a cold , I see . - How dare you ? - Find something warm to wear . I think you can make you choice from amongst these . We 're lucky . 1st JUNE Line twenty-two - Egypt . Follow me , please . No nonsense , now ! Today is June 1st . And June is the last month of your regular excursions called The Fall of the Bastille . - But - that 's me ! 1st JUNE Did you see ? - It 's supposed to be the second . Yesterday was the first . - But it is yesterday ! - You landed ... You did it on purpose ? - Let 's go and talk somewhere . - That means my car 's outside ? If I 'm not wrong ... suits should hang in closets . - Hm . Well , put them there , then . See . Just like yesterday . Yesterday 's Kraus is going to rob today 's Kraus . - What are you doing ? Halt ! - You there ! Stop ! Stop ! I said , stop ! Hold him ! Thief ! But that 's me ... ! Why did you do it ? - I have my reasons . - What are they ? - Don 't you understand ? What happened didn 't happen . June the first is only beginning . Me , for example . In a little while I shall get up and scald myself with tea . Because everything 's happening all over again at my flat . Do you understand , gentlemen ? I 'm getting breakfast and Charles hasn 't started suffocating on that roll yet . He 's still alive . I must save him . I don 't want John to take his place again . That 's my reason . - Ah , yes , I see . - But how could you just put on his uniform and pilot the rocket ? - It was me who designed and tested these rockets . Gentlemen , your friend Abard was executed . But here stands today 's Abard , today 's Bauer . They 're waiting at their hotel , for the flight . They may still be asleep . - Damn it , you 're right . We can have a repeat performance ! - This time without mistakes ! - That 's right . - Thank you . - Wait ! - How 's that ? Why ? - Mr. Bures , you have exactly three and a half minutes to save your brother , Charles Bures the pilot . - What ? - We shan 't be needing you again . Hurry up , or Charles will suffocate . Like yesterday . Donald ! Donald ! Leave than gentleman alone ! Poor John . He suffocated on a roll . That was a great idea of yours , having a repeat performance ! But without you this time ! We 're in Prague . Are the suits in the closet ? Of course . The suits are where they belong , in the closet . And what about the armchairs ? All right ? - Of course . - So that everything 's O.K. Thank you . Come in ! - We were there , the operation was a flop . - Where ? - What are you talking about ? - Here 's proof ! Everything twice . This is you document , from yesterday 's trip . - Of course ... but ... But how 's that possible ? - You 'd better not even ask about Hitler 's reception . We came back a while ago , but on June 1st again . But the pilot wasn 't Charles Bures , it was his brother . You see - Charles Bures had died . - Nonsense - I 've just spoken to him on the phone ! Everything 's all right . - Yes , of course , because Mr. Bauer saved him in the last moment . I personally drove him right in front of that house . - What ? I haven 't been away from here at all ! - Not you . You don 't have any part in this game , anyway . There are two Bauers now . So that I 'm very sorry but ... May I ... ? - What are you doing ? - Kraus ! Have you gone mad ? - Do a little thinking ! What do we need two identical engineers for ... What manners , man . Don 't you have pity on anybody ? - Yes . Mrs. Bauer , for example . Just imagine if the poor woman were to have this at home - twice ... ! What ? Poor Bauer . It 's a good thing you didn 't shoot me , too . - That 's not necessary , they executed your first version at Hitler 's place . - What ? - I 'll explain afterwards . Let 's go . Hey ! Hey ! Please ! Please - are you going to town ? Please take me at least to the Metro ! - I can 't take you any further anyway . Come on then ! Could I please make a call ? - You must dial zero first , I 'm linked onto our dispatch centre . - Oh , thanks . Hello , is that John or Charles ? This is ... Charles Bures . So Bauer came in time , he managed to save you ? Who 's Bauer ? That little chap in the funny hat ! Somebody in a funny hat was killed in a car accident in front of the house . So it 's all gone wrong again ! Oh dear ! What now ? I wouldn 't know . Who is this , anyway ? Johnny ! I know you 're John ! I just know ! I 'm John too . I 'm John too . That means we 're both of us John now . I was you , understand ? ! I am you , but your yesterday you . You 're today 's John . Me ! Understand ? You pretending to be Charles too , like me . Like me ! Stop all this joking ! We have a death in the family . Don 't keep me , I 'm busy ! Please , may I ... ? Thanks . Universum ? Mr. Rousek , please . Mr. Rousek ? This is about Charles Bures . He 'll be kissing Mrs. No1 in the office in about twenty minutes . You go in there , they 'll stop kissing and ... Dear Sir , why on earth would I go in there ? Mrs. No1 happens to be here in my office ! With the files . There 's going to be a mistake in those files ! So you 'll go in there again ! And then Charles Bures will be kissing Mrs. No1 , but they 'll stop , and you please be so kind as to tell Bures not to go to Eva 's place , not to propose to her ! Helena , the air hostess , is going to fall in love with him . At - about - three in the afternoon . And he cares for Helena too , she 's wonderful girl ! - I 'm not interested in all this gossip , mister ! Hello ! - How about getting out ? A bit of fresh air won 't hurt you ... - But I 'm in an awful hurry ! - Ou ! Oh - how will I get to ... - You seem to know all about everything that 's going to happen , so I 'm sure you know which idiot is going to give you a lift this time . A complaint ? Second door to the left . - Thank you . - That 's all right . Hi , chum ! Permit me to flap my flapper at you ! Come here , my boy ! Come here for a minute ! - But I 'm in a hurry ! I 'm late . Now then , my boy . What happened between you and Margaret yesterday ? Well ? - Well ... Margaret who ... ? - For God 's sake , this is too much ... You still have the courage to make fun of me ? What now ? ! What here ? - I have to kill myself now . - What an odd person you are ... - How can two of us live from one salary ... - Where do you want to do it ? - Look here , at this time I started on my round trip of Prague . We have to wait for me here . See ? I 'm surprised at you ! In a few days 'time he 'll pretend not to know you . Good morning , Bures . Anything wrong ? - Hello . - Charles ! - Hello , Miss . - There , you see ... You 're a scoundrel , Bures . Suddenly you pretend no to know her ! And just look at you ... you 're a sight ! - Somebody beat me up , but I don 't know who it was . I 'm a bit ... you see , my brother has died . - For God 's sake , what happened ? - He suffocated on a roll . - Ah . I 'd ... I 'd need a rest now . - Ah , yes , all right , all right . But mind you 're at the dispatch centre an hour before the start . - What time do I start ? Sorry , but I 've forgotten . - At fourteen ten . Boy some roses , Sir ! - I 'm in a hurry ! Mr. Bures ... ! - Sorry . In a minute a man is coming in here , who 'll look exactly like me , except that he 'll be in uniform . You mustn 't let him in at any cost , understand ? Is that clear ? - That 's clear . - And could you call Mr. Kroupa for me ? I have to talk to him , just the two of us . Eva mustn 't know ! Buy some roses , Sir ! Roses . Seven . Seven for luck . Oh , it 's you ? How you get around ? And who 's hurt you ? Economizing on flowers - that 's all wrong . I 'm sorry , so sorry . Do tell me , how could such a thing have happened to John ? - Mr. Kroupa , the dead man isn 't John but Charles , you see . - In that case ... who are you ? - I 'm John ! - You are Jan ? - You must tell Eva that Charles wouldn 't have married her anyway . - How 's that ? - Well , he also promised to marry somebody called Mrs. No1 , and he had all sorts of affaires . - The scoundrel ? ! Well ... Sorry ... Nothing but good about the dead . - Charles ! - Please tell her , but carefully ! - Carefully , of course . - You 've come , at last ! - Evie , Evie , you must be brave . This isn 't Charles , it 's John . - John ? - Charles choked on a roll . - Yes , he choked . Wait , what are you ... Wait ... Not like that , no ! - Eva ! - Go away ! The chair , come on ... ! - The chair ! - Here it is . - Put it down here then . - Eva , what happened to you ? Daddy , what 's wrong with her ? - Come on now , come on ... - Eva , darling ! Christ , what 's happened ? - Don 't stand here screaming and pop over to the Novak 's for some ammonia . Run ! You ? But you 're dead ! - It 's my brother who 's dead . - Yeah . All fun and jokes and my little Eva nearly died of fright ! Charles , you 're alive ? - I 'm alive . And I 've been playing at Charles . Like you have . - You 're alive , Charles ? - No , wait ! I 'm not . Do you know who Charles was ? - Honestly ... - A scoundrel ! A Fascist ! He wanted to change history ! A threat to the whole world ! D 'you understand ? - So you 're alive , Charles . - But I 'm not Charles ! I 'm you ! - You are gave me a fright ... - I guess I 'll never be able to explain . - What sort of a stupid game is this ? I 'll try and explain . - Charles , darling , you 're alive ? ! - Let him be ! He 's a scoundrel ! - He 's two-timing you ! - Let me go ! I 'll never give him up ! You were just trying to make me forget him ! - I 'll explain ! - There 's no need ! Come here ! Charles , darling , are you all right ? - For heaven 's sake , what 's happening ? - They 've tricked us . Both of them are in it , together ! Who knows which of them is Charles ! I 'm not ! - There ! Neither am I ! - How 's that ? They 're making fun of us , both of them . Peter , this one first ! What 's to become of us ? - You 've made us into orphans , orphans ... - We have a premiere next week ! This is a tragedy . - It 's no good making so much ado about this . Nothing so terrible has happened . It could have been worse . - Can 't you see they 're all dead ? ! - Don 't worry doctor , they 'll be as fit as a fiddle again tomorrow ... Today ... as a matter of fact ! It 's high time . We start in one hour . - Calm down ! I made it in time yesterday too . That 's me over there ! See ? Exactly like yesterday ! - Ah . Are you crazy ? You can 't shoot from here ! - You 'll have to cover me ! Your coat ! Boys ! Do you have to play right here ? ! Halt ! Halt ! Stop ! Eagle calling ! Eagle calling ! Eagle calling ! Eagle calling ! Some patent , this ... Eagle calling , eagle calling ! 1st JUNE Bauer is no longer there . Come along ! Quick ! The visit to the dinosaur , line 27 , please get ready for departure . - Where are you ? I just can 't wait any longer ! - We 've got the police at our heels . Are you Charles Bures ? - What sort of a stupid question is that ... The suitcase ! - Where is Bauer ? Was he with you ? - As you see . He saved me from suffocation . Otherwise I wouldn 't be here ! - Where can he be , what can be keeping him ? Look here ! The same thing as yesterday ! The two of them will fly with us . - Calm down ! And go to the cloakrooms , fast . That 's all right , Captain . This guy 's something else again . Much better . - Well , I don 't know . - What is it ? Well ? - There 's something I don 't like about this . May I , Helena ? - Yes . Mr. Abard has booked the whole flight . Mr. And Mrs. White will not be going on this trip . - Really , what impertinence ! - I 'm sorry , but their tickets are valid . They 'll go ! - By what right ... - I have different instructions . - I cannot believe it ... ! - If they bring me written instruction from the director , all right . I 'll wait here . - I 'll see to it at once . - Just a minute , Helena ! - My brother sends his love . - But ... that 's impossible . Why ... - Surely this matter of your brother could wait right now , couldn 't it ? - Just a minute ! Helena ! John wants to ask you on a date . Would you go ? - You 're having me on , aren 't you ? That 's you all over ! The car was hired in the name Rolf Kraus and that man was seen running in here ! - Rolf Kraus ? - Rolf Kraus . - Here . Line twenty-seven , departure time fourteen ten , tunnel B. We can make it ! R-K-M do not start ! R-K-M do you hear me ? Do not start ! The control centre forbids you to start ! R-K-M reports position - flying through atmosphere . But that means ... - That it 's gone without you ! Escaped us all ! - Can 't you get the rocket back ... - No , we can 't . That would endanger the passengers . - But that 's scandalous ! - Well ... - How about looking in on the building of the pyramids ? - Tch ! Pyramids indeed ... - Or the Battle of Waterloo ? We would of course make up the difference in price . Waterloo ? Never heard of it . Watergate , you mean ? ! Gentlemen , how about visiting me in my cabin ? You 're great , man just the type I like . There . You see ! A gift for the Fuehrer . I suspected him wrongly . It worked beautifully today . Is this really possible ? Two brothers , one of them a fool and the other such a smartie ! - When we 've won , I shall propose a distinction for Charles Bures . The Iron Cross with Oak leaves ! We must definitely renew that distinction ! You 'll get it too ! - Oh , all right ... - The historical moment is approaching ! The Fuehrer is sure to want to see the rocket personally . Wait here ! - You 'll become witnesses to the moment - O.K. Then . Let 's go ! - When the whole world is to be saved ! - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Two spies are about to assassinate Hitler . They 'll be attacking Admiral Wolf 's car , guard it . They have an infernal machine in that suitcase they 're carrying ! Is there anything I can do for you , Sturmbannfuehrer ? What 's the day today ? Admiral ? - Just a moment ! It didn 't go like this ! Watch out ! The bomb ! Down ! This is crazy , Bures ! You haven 't started yet ! Bures , can you hear me ? 1st JUNE Today is June 1st . And June is the last month for our regular trips called The Fall of the Bastille . What 'll we have , Charlie ? - Coffee , sweetie ! Sorry to interrupt , but would you like to listen to something ? - What 's it about ? - How shall I explain ... Look . My brother 's a scoundrel , a Fascist . And there 's a whole gang of them ! No , wait ! It all started this way ... Actually , it 's going to start ! In a little while I 'll get up and I 'll scald myself with tea ! - What ? - Keep calm . What 's wrong ? No parking here ? - The parking 's all right , Mr. Kraus . - Yes ? The Suits are in the closet , where they should be . Yes , yes . Charles ? Charles , how are you ? Look ! That 's me ! - Sorry . - Donald ... - I know it 's odd , but it 's a fact . Quickly , please , this is matter of seconds ! Please ... Here doctor , this way ! That damned roll ... ! He looks well again , doctor . - Yes , well . You were lucky . - But you nearly had it . - How right you are . I 'm sorry , doctor , but it did look awful . - That 's all right , a brother 's a brother . Except that Johnny is always panicky . But thanks , doctor . Eva darling , this is Charles . I dreamt about you all night . We must get married , and soon ! - Charles ! Charles ... Mummy ! Doctor , do you think that such an incident as the one with the roll could have a basic influence on a man 's character ? - Hm ... that 's difficult to say . You got me into a mess ! - Wait ! I 've got to tell you something ! - Well , talk then ! - Johnny , don 't go there ! - Why not ? How did this watch come to be here ? - Really ... - Well , whose is it ? I have no idea . But surely that 's no so important . I 'd like to tell you something important . - What ? You said you have nobody to live for . I made a date for you with a certain air hostess . Her name is Helena . You 'll like her a lot ! Charles , you had an affaire with her ... ? - On the contrary ! She hates me . Buy some roses , Mister ! - Shall we buy some roses ? - Let 's ... - Two bunches , seven roses to the bunch . - Seven 's for luck . - Although it didn 't bring much luck last time . Not to you . - I don 't know what you 're talking about , gentlemen . You 've never been here before . - Charles ! Charles ! Charles ! Take more care next time ! Did you hear ? - And I will , too ! Charles ! I nearly lost you ! THE END

 Why don 't you stay and make your home here ? That 's a good question . I guess the reason is that , uh , Virdon 's got an itch in his feet , and , uh , I got rocks in my head , which is why I go along . We 're taking a survey of the far side of every hill on the horizon . I 'd like to give you a better answer , but I can 't think of one . Daughter ? Amy ? Will you say good-bye ? No . You 're a stranger from another world . I don 't know how to talk to men from another world . I 'm sorry Amy 's upset . I expected her to be . I know my daughter . - I wish you well . - Thank you for everything , Talbert . You ready ? Let 's go . - Bye . - Bye-bye . Maybe they will come back someday . No . Never . [ Clears Throat ] All right , now , move it along . Come on , move along . I 'm just transferring these two to the workforce in the next village . Father , what 's wrong ? It 's-It 's nothing , I 'm ... just a little tired . A little tired . [ Grunting ] Ha ! [ Laughs ] If I were only young and strong again . [ Grunts Loudly ] Urko , a message from Trion . The troopers report the humans have sleeping sickness . I 'll do better next time . Urko , we have a bet . The best two of three . I haven 't got time to play games ! What 's the matter , Galen , you hear something ? Not yet . Expecting company ? Trouble . Well , what is this , crystal ball time ? Let us in on it . What 's the matter , Galen ? Something 's bothering you . You are . I didn 't like what you did . - When ? - When I joined up with you two , I knew I would have to face the same dangers that you face . [ Sighs ] In fact , Urko has probably told his gorillas ... that I am first priority on his death list . With my own people , I 'm a renegade . I accept that . But I did think , at least , that we would try to protect each other . Hey-Hey , who 's not protecting what ? Or did I miss something ? Galen , I still don 't understand what it is . If you tell me what it is , I 'll correct it if I can . You can 't put water back into a broken bottle . Time and time again , you have cautioned us ... that we must be very careful not to tell anyone about ourselves . Amy . Hi , Amy . I 'm in love with you . Amy , you met me one week ago . You 'll forget me in two . Will you forget me ? - No . - Alan , take me with you , please . I can 't . I 've told you why . You 're married . I don 't believe you . You 're lying . Amy , now listen . I 'm a stranger here . I come from a world ... that 's very difficult to explain . It ' s this world , really , but in a different time . A long , long time ago . Now , you must not tell anyone . But I want you to understand . Where I come from , where I hope to return someday ... in that world , I do have a family . Lies ! There is no other world . First , you made her angry , then you told her who we are . Not only did you trust her with your life , but you trusted her with ours . You 're right , Galen . I shouldn 't have told her . She- - Well , she was hurt , and I ... wanted to try to make her understand why I couldn 't stay . That 's not an excuse , it 's- - I 'd just like you to know why . I am truly sorry . I didn 't think that you meant any harm . It just did seem like such a needless risk to take . It was . Chalk it up to , uh , the fact I 'm only a human . Oh , yes . Sometimes , I forget that humans can 't help the weaknesses they have . [ Man Gasping ] Father ! Father ! [ Crying ] - [ Chattering ] - Order . Please , come to order ! You babble on like frightened humans . There is much at stake here , Zaius ! Our historians have brought this to my attention . In the early part of the Ornan period , a fever , which struck only the human population , killed several hundred in a section of the rural zone . The entire sector became barren for years afterward ! The entire sector became barren for years afterward ! I am aware of the possible loss of goods and labor , that is why I have ordered Trion quarantined . Quarantined ? Burn it ! Before we consider any such measures , Urko , our chief medical officer , Zoran , has something to say . Members of the council , I have done considerable research ... in the diseases of the lower species , and I have developed certain theories of treat- - Theories ! Excuses to waste time and resources ... on-on intellectual games ! I intend to test my theories in trial . An entire labor force of a whole section is being threatened , - and he wants to test theories . - [ Gavel Bangs ] Trion is quite isolated . And with the quarantine , the risk is reduced greatly . If I can save Trion , we need fear this fever never again ! Zero loss of labor and goods in the future . - If you can save Trion ! - [ Zaius ] Vote ! Vote . Those in favor of allowing Zoran to proceed to Trion ? - Aye ! - No ! So be it . I will be at Trion to enforce the quarantine . And if you fail- - You will not regret your faith in me . Well , good morning , friend . - Oh ! - I 'm sorry , sir . Wait a minute , you 're from Trion , aren 't you ? - You 're the coal carrier . - [ Man ] Not anymore . - What do you mean not anymore ? - I was lucky . I was outside the village . Guards let no one in , no one out . - A man was shot trying to run . - What are you talking about ? It ' s quarantined ; a plague . I was told many are dead , and more will die--many more . - You know the names of any of the dead ? - Nothing . Nothing . I was spared . Even the name could carry the fever . Wait a minute . Wait ! A guy doesn 't have to be a mind reader to figure out what you 're thinking about . Oh , no . Will you tell him that it makes no sense ... to go waltzing into a plague-ridden village ? Yes , if you did go back , what good could you do ? I don 't know . But what if we were the ones who started it ? [ Groans ] Pete , what if we walked in there carrying some kind of a virus ... harmless to us , but deadly to them ? Yes , but if you went back , isn 't there a possibility that you could catch the fever ? Yes , there is . If we didn 't get shot on the way trying to get in ! Aw , come on , Alan . Look , this makes no sense . Pete , we 've gotta try . We 've got to at least try to help them . Did I say that we didn 't at least have to try ? All right , we 'll try . I 'm in . I 'm in ! You just wait one minute ! Now you just wait ! Are you planning to include me in on this trip back to Trion ? Well , yes , I figured- - I hoped we would stay together . But we have just been through all that ! Just because that girl is in love with you , should I risk my life ? No . There 's no reason at all for that . Ha . And should you risk your life by going back there ? [ Exasperated Sigh ] But you stubbornly insist upon doing it , don 't you ? [ Sighs ] I am getting to be no better than a human . [ Exasperated Sigh ] Come on , let 's go ! [ Scoffs ] What are you doing here ? Haven 't you heard there 's fever ? We are somewhat familiar with the problem , and we would like to help . Council has sent the chief physician . Now turn around , and go back where you came from . - Look , all we want is to try- - - I have orders to kill anyone ... that crosses the quarantine line . Now , move ! Look ! Stagnant water ... and mosquitoes . Yeah , come on . [ Goats Bleating ] Help me , please . - No question about it . - Malaria . Okay , let 's get started . - Alan ! - Amy ! My father . My father 's dead . Amy , I 'm so sorry . Amy , how do you feel ? I 'm fine . I 'm very tired , but I 'm not sick . All right , listen to me , all of you . Come in here and listen . Hurry people , please . There 's no time to lose . Closer . All right . Now the first thing , we 've got to bury the dead immediately . If we don 't , we 're going to be fighting fever and dysentery and worse . We 've gotta set fires , gotta make a lot of smoke to keep away the mosquitoes . A treatment center 's got to be set up right away . Work parties have to be organized . - Everyone who is still not- - - Silence ! - You , who are you ? - Just a man trying to help . I am Zoran , chief medical officer of the Supreme Council . This is my assistant , Inta . I have complete authority here now . [ Alan ] We 're happy to see you . Perhaps we can work together . [ Zoran ] Apit will be dug at once . It will be filled with water , and I will add certain medications . Everyone will disrobe and immerse themselves . Each one of you will be bled . The amount determined by your size and the age . And there will be no physical contact between men and women ... until this disease is under control . You seem to have a talent for organizing . You 'll supervise the digging of the pit . Inta ! - You 're whistling Dixie , Doc . - I 'm whistling ? I shall speak more clearly . You still hear whistling ? - Something wrong with your ears ? - No , what I 'm saying- - [ Stammering ] No , what he is suggesting , sir , is that ... this particular disease , with which they are both very familiar , does demand special treatment . Who are you ? What are you doing in this village ? Well , I am just transferring these two humans to another farm . Listen to them , sir . They are more intelligent than most . So , you 're familiar with this disease ? - It 's malaria . - Hmm . [ Laughs ] How clever , he even has a name for it . Inta , go call the guards . I haven 't the time to fool with this man . Please , sir . The guards aren 't necessary . Uh , you see , malaria means simply " bad air . " Like the type you find around those stagnant pools we passed on our way in here . You see , sir , the mosquitoes that live ... around that stagnant water carry the disease , - and it 's communicated by their sting . - That is enough ! I don 't know whether to have you shot for stupidity , or hanged for insolence ! But , sir- - Germs flying through the air on the backs of insects ? Disease of the lower species are transmitted from bodily contact . This one isn 't . You are challenging my word . But , sir , he did not mean to be insolent . Just like most humans , fear puts foolish words in their mouths . Yes , I have a quick cure for that disease . But , sir , they do both know something about medicine . [ Zoran ] That is impossible ! Arrest these two . Arrest them ? I 'll shoot them . They crossed the quarantine line against my orders . - As you please . - I protest ! Has he had bodily contact with the lower species ? He has malaria . [ Kava ] What is he saying ? What is malaria ? You said the fever strikes only humans . Explain . [ Stammers ] I-I can 't . I can 't explain . I can 't . Neesa . Neesa 's dead . You dare tell that to Urko . I want guards at that end of the road , and I want more guards at that end of the road . Watch closely , if anyone tries to escape from the village , shoot them ! - Now move out ! - Urko . Oh ! [ Alan ] Galen , you think he 'll come into the village ? - I don 't know , does it matter ? - Only if you want to stay alive a little longer . You know , maybe we could get away before Urko has guards posted everywhere . You were right when you said coming back here would probably get us into trouble . And you 're probably right that we should leave right now . But you won 't . [ Sighs ] And you , Pete ? I know it sounds silly , Galen , it does sound silly . So silly , I won 't even say it . You know the answer . I know the answer . Yeah , I knew the answer before I asked . I always know the answer . I always disagree , and I always go along . But maybe I 'm sick ... in the head . [ Groans ] Fire ! Fire ! Purification by fire ! That 's the only course left ! The situation is different now , Zaius ! Apes are being threatened . Please ! We must calm ourselves and think rationally . [ Orangutan ] But an ape has died , Zaius ! An ape ! It is no longer a minor problem . You and your theories . He oughta be burned with the others ! Urko , you are out of order ! I suggest we hear Zoran 's appraisal of the situation . I agree . He has promised us success . [ Clears Throat ] Upon my arrival in Trion , I discovered that the fever ... was not of the Ornan variety as related in the textbooks . I made a discovery of a rare disease called malaria . Obviously fatal to apes and to humans , and obviously not transmitted through bodily contact . Then how , Zoran ? I have reason to believe that the disease grows ... in stagnant pools of water ... and is introduced into the bloodstream by the bite of ... mosquitoes . [ Both Laughing ] Zoran , are you aware of what you 're asking us to believe ? You can 't be serious . He 's got the fever himself . There are such pools of stagnant water in Trion , and humans- - and your soldiers- - were exposed to it . And what do you propose we do now ? Well , I need several hours to further reappraise the situation , Zaius . - I will not back down to a mosquito . - [ Chuckles ] Urko , this disease is fatal to our people . We should use this situation to develop a cure . Yes , perhaps there 's a positive side to this . We can experiment with the humans . Even if we lost an entire village , if an ape cure was developed , it would be worth it . Historically , medicine progresses because of such experimentation . Historically , medicine progresses because of such experimentation . Yes , I believe we should use this opportunity . [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] So be it . You will report to us . Yes , Zaius . You 're very good , ladies . Very good . - What are they doing ? - Protective masks and gloves . We have to send a work crew down to drain off the stagnant water . I 'm in a most difficult position with the council . I have related to them your mosquito theory . Of course , in order to save you from punishment , should we fail , I told them that the theory was my own . You 're very generous . No , not entirely . You see , if I had told them that I heard it from you , they would have asked questions : Who you were , how you came by this information . Urko especially would be particularly interested and curious about ... humans who know more than they should . I do hope you know about this disease . Have we been wrong yet ? You provided a diagnosis- - a name for the disease . Right or wrong , it adds up to very little . What about treatment ? There is a treatment for malaria . It 's quinine . It ' s extracted from the bark of a tree . A tree called a cinchona . I 've never heard of such a tree . Just beyond the marsh , there 's a heavily wooded area . Fairly tropical growth , where a cinchona could grow . If we 're lucky , you will get a chance to see one . [ Alan ] Down through here , watch the bridge . Now this swamp 's gotta be drained . Right here . And remember , no part of your body exposed . Good luck , Galen . The rest of you , come on . [ Hoofbeats Approaching ] Quick , everybody put their mask on . [ Urko ] Running away , Doctor ? No , the cure for the disease is in the bark of a certain tree we believe- - " We " ? " We believe " ? What do you mean " we " ? I was under the impression you had the sole authority here . I am the sole authority here . I described the tree to them and we- - they believe it can be found in the forest . Why do you cover your faces ? What are you afraid of ? - Mosquitoes . - Ha ! There are no mosquitoes here . Ah ... missed . Albino mosquitoes , all white . Very hard to see . [ Gasping ] [ Breathes Heavily ] - Could be . - Yeah , could be . Let 's go . Could be , it 's bitter enough . I 'd feel a lot better if we were sure . - So do I. - Ugh ! Terrible . That was the first thing I learned when I was a kid . - All good medicine tastes terrible . - But will it cure the fever ? It won 't if we just stand around here . Let 's give it a try . All right , move over here . Take as much bark as you can , but quick . [ Alan ] All right , everybody . Come here , we gotta move fast . Get rocks , flat stones . We gotta grind this bark into powder as quickly as we can . - Any more deaths ? - One . - Any more illnesses ? - Two more sick . Amy . Oh , Amy . Amy . I 'm sorry . I wanted to help . I know , I know , I know , Amy . It 's all right . Don 't worry . Amy , look , we found what we were looking for , but you gotta hang on . You gotta fight it , okay ? [ Goats Bleating ] Thatta boy . Thatta boy . Come on . That 's it . Good . Good . Okay . Drink this now . Come on , drink it . I know , I know . Come on , try it again . Alan , Galen 's back . [ Amy ] Another time , another world . [ Groans ] Don 't go back . I love you . I love you ! Tell me . Tell me the truth . I love you . Don 't go back . [ Groaning ] Don 't leave me . Don 't leave me . The swamp has been drained . Good work , Galen . Another time . [ Mumbles ] - Another world . - Another world ? Don 't go back . Don 't go back . Don 't go back . [ Inta ] Dr. Zoran ! Dr. Zoran ! Come quick to the upper road ! Hurry , hurry . Kava 's sick , he 's dying . Urko . Urko , Kava is sick . We 'll all catch the shaking sickness ! Now we 'll see , Doctor . Now we 'll see if the council still believes in you . This village will burn and everyone in it . Everyone ! Urko , I promise you that I will take care of it ! You make empty promises , and my troops are dying ! Oh , believe me , believe me . I have the means to cure him . This is a new medicine ! A new medication . It 's made from the bark of a tree which I looked for and finally found in time . You will not experiment with my troops . Now ! Burn the village now before we are all destroyed . No , we are making progress ! This medication , Zoran . Is it effective ? Yes , yes , it will work . It will take time- - There is no more time ! How many must die before you do what must be done ? I demand a vote . You will have your vote , Urko . No ! No more talking ! Urko , I sometimes wonder what you fear most- - death , or a few words of reason . You . I fear you . All of you , listening to a fool . Zoran has found a medication . Perhaps it will work , perhaps not . What Urko says is true , with delay there is risk . We have come this far . The answer , right or wrong , will be in a few hours . Those in favor of letting Zoran continue ? - Those against ? - Aye . Very well . The decision is mine . You have until noon tomorrow . Thank you , sir . Fools ! When you are all dying in pain like Kava ... don 't forget what I told you . Noon tomorrow . I don 't know . You told me the medication worked quickly . Yes , it does , but there could be other factors . We don 't know for sure whether it 's a true cinchona tree . Could be a mutation , no medicinal value . It could be a different strain of malaria that doesn 't respond . So many unknowns . I was in no position to bargain with the council . I know , I understand . [ Sighs ] Well , we 'll medicate them again in the morning . Nothing more we can do now but wait . Yes , I suggest that you get some sleep . Well , I think I 'll get some air first . [ Crickets Chirping ] [ Woman Moaning ] Amy ? Amy ? Yes ? Your friend ... from the other world . Yes ? Where is that other world ? Where did he come from ? - [ Moans ] Here . - Here ? Is he an astronaut ? Amy , listen to me . Is he a- - [ Yells ] Shh . Why , uh , why are you sneaking up on me ? Oh , I-I was just coming to look at the girl . Tell me something , is she beginning to talk strangely again ? - Strangely ? - Yes , it 's the fever . Oh , it does make her say the most impossible things . She 's got a very good imagination though . Yes , yes . I , uh , could make no sense of it . Yeah . [ Shivering ] [ Groaning ] [ Grunting , Gasping Continues ] Here , drink this . It 'll help you . [ Choking , Coughing ] Who is it ? - What were those shots ? - Where have you been ? Just a small mercy mission . - You treated Kava ? - Yeah . Oh , terrific . Now he 's making house calls . - You risked your life for an ape ? - His pain is no different . I 'm afraid I left the evidence behind when I ran . - Can anyone identify you ? - I don 't think so . It was too dark . - I wonder if it really matters . - What do you mean ? Whether Urko believes it was him or me , the results are the same . If Zoran loses , Urko wins . That gives him more freedom , authority , more power to run things the way he wants . What difference does it make ? If we don 't come up with the results by noon , this whole village will be ashes . What is it ? I heard a sound . There was someone with Kava . - Who ? - I couldn 't see , sir . Kava , who was it ? Who was it ? - [ Moaning ] - Kava , was it Zoran ? - [ Shudders ] - Was it Zoran ? Did you drink this ? Did you drink this ? - Yes . - [ Grunts ] If Kava dies , if they 've killed him with this medicine , I 'll kill you myself . How 's she doing ? She seems to be resting better . Her fever 's down a little . When they wake up , we 'll give the second medication . - We need time . - Zaius gave me until noon . If he can control the situation- - The gorillas are coming ! They 'll burn our houses , everything ! - [ Dogs Barking ] - [ Clamoring ] There goes the situation . Urko cannot do this . He acts independently of the council . I came here for a victory of my own . Urko will not take it away from me . Not when it is this close . - Could the council - have changed its mind ? - I think not . This is between Urko and myself . - Do we try to get away ? - There 's no way for that now . It looks like our future 's in his hands . Watch closely , you may see the future come to a very quick stop . We are helpless . We can 't run , we have no weapons . We 've got one . Stand aside . It is several hours yet till noon , Urko . Stand aside , or die with the others in the village . - The council voted ! - The council be damned ! That is treason , Urko . I command you to withdraw . You command ? You have words , I have weapons . - Would you kill me , Urko ? - Before I allow you to let him kill my troops ? Yes . Listen to me . Urko doesn 't care for you . He thinks of himself first . He would not let me help Kava . He would let Kava die to discredit me ! It is Zoran who thinks only of himself . He could not help Kava . He could help no one . It appears you were misinformed , Urko . It 's a lie . A trick . [ Kava ] No ! Last night , somebody came to me from the village . - I was dying ! - Silence ! I order you . Urko , you are wrong . They gave me something to drink , bitter medicine . The medicine made me better . It saved my life , Urko . Urko , I tell you again , take your troops and withdraw ... while you still have them to command . Withdraw ! Withdraw ! [ Horses Galloping Away ] [ Chattering ] I 'd like to speak to you three for a moment , please . I suppose you 'll be wanting to leave soon . Right , today . Well , I 'm afraid that 's not possible . - Why ? - I can 't let you go . Oh , but , uh , everything 's under control- - No , no , no , you don 't understand . I mean , I must tell Zaius and the others about you . You see , I know who you are . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Please , don 't make it any more difficult than it is . Your medical knowledge , the things the girl said in the fever . I know you are the two astronauts . And Galen is with you . Understand , I- - I deeply appreciate ... what you 've done here , what I 've learned from you . Then how could you possibly turn us in ? Because you are fugitives . Zaius wants you , and I am loyal to Zaius . - Then what we did means nothing to you . - Oh , no , it does . It does , it does . But , uh- - - But we 're the lower species . - Yes . If we 're lower , how come we 're smarter ? - No , I can 't explain that . - How will you explain ... that your victory here is really theirs ? Or do you intend to keep all the credit for yourself ? No . I , uh , I had no other choice . I have my position to uphold . [ Chuckles ] You turn us in , you think we won 't tell Zaius ? [ Laughing ] He 'd never believe you . [ Laughing ] He 'd believe me . Very well , Galen , you may leave . Oh . [ Clears Throat ] Well , you see , where they go , I go . If they stay here , I stay . Oh , you can 't be serious . Just try me . But-But , don 't you see they are , uh- - Mmm . I know . Lower species . - [ All Laughing ] - Well , now , Zoran , you 've got a decision to make . Your loyalty , or your ego . Ego , ego . I , uh , am not familiar with that word . Just how are you going to feel , Doctor , when Zaius finds out ... that you 've been counseled by humans- - every move you made , every word you spoke . I suggest that you stay out of sight for now , and then leave after dark . Good . It 's just as bad the second time ... saying good-bye , I mean . You 'll be all right , Amy . When I was sick ... I had this terrible dream ... that I told the apes about you , and they were going to hurt you . What a terrible dream . That 's all it was , just a dream . It seemed so real . There are a lot of things that seem real ... that ... in time , turn out to be not so important . Or they 're forgotten . Someday , I 'll have a family . And I 'll tell my children ... about this man from ... another world ... who 's the kind of man that ... they should grow up to be like . Be happy , Amy . [ Crickets Chirping ]

 Keldan Control , Keldan Control , this is Nova Queen on primary approach 0-4-0 . Request orbital entry clearance . Nova Queen , Nova Queen , this is Keldan control . Maintain 0-4-0 . Orbital entry is clear . Keldan Control , this is Nova Queen . I have an unidentified trace on 0-4-0 . Nova Queen , this is Keldan Control . Maintain 0-4-0 and switch to Computer Flight Coordination . Switching to CFC , maintaining 0-4-0 . That ship is still coming at us . Nova Queen , this is Keldan Control . The ship is an unmanned ore carrier on Computer Flight Coordination . I hope you 're sure about that , Keldan ; it 's still on 0-4-0 . Nova Queen , computer control is confirmed . No problem . You know that and I know that , but does the computer know that ? It 'll switch vectors any time now . Relax . I 'll relax when it gets that ship off 0-4-0 . It will . Keldan control , I have 4000 passengers on this ship and that ore carrier is still on 0-4-0 . Computer flight coordination doesn ' t make errors . To hell with that ! Do something , Keldan . That thing is coming straight at us . Keldan Control ! Nova Queen , switch to manual control , engage emergency boosters and abort 0-4-0 . Confirm please ! I can see it ! My God , it 's too late ! Nova Queen , Nova Queen , this is Keldan Control , do you copy ? Nova Queen ! Nova Queen , come in please ! Unfortunate . You do have a way with words , Supreme Commander . I 'm sorry , that was unnecessary . Everyone on the Nova Queen died instantly of course , but it didn 't end there . The ship 's neutron drive unit broke free , survived the fall through the atmosphere . It went critical just about the time it hit the surface . Ground zero was slap in the middle of Keldan City . Half the population was killed outright . It was a computer malfunction , presumably . Yes . These things happen , Durkim . They 're happening far too often , Supreme Commander . Computer Flight Coordination is breaking down on 20 different worlds and the problem is spreading . Are you saying it 's a basic design fault ? . No , that 's not what I 'm saying . Look . That 's the equatorial zone on Palmero . Palmero ? . Yes , and that is snow you 're looking at , Supreme Commander . It 'll be some time before they re-establish themselves as the Federation 's main producer of tropical fruit . And this , the plains of Suni . Mean temperature has gone up by twenty degrees . It hasn 't rained anywhere on that planet in sixty days . When it does , the effect will be something like this . The planet Vilka , where it hasn 't stopped raining for sixty days . The planet Herom . Carthenis . Climate control has gone disastrously wrong on all the frontier worlds . - And it 's spreading ? . - Rapidly . - Anything else ? . - Isn 't that enough ? . No , it 's impossible , Durkim . You mean unthinkable , don 't you ? . Look , everything you 've just seen has one common denominator . - Computers . - Not computers . Computer . Singular . Very singular indeed . Our unbeatable control and coordination centre . - No ! - Servalan , by design or accident , Star One is failing . - There has to be another explanation . - There isn 't . And if you want to keep your job you 'll find it . Why won 't you face the facts ? . Because I 'm not convinced . And even if I were , there would be nothing I could do about it . Well , surely under the circumstances you could get clearance to put a team in . Star One is the most secure installation in the Federation . - I know that . - Do you know why it 's so thoroughly secure ? . Well , presumably because knowledge of its location is severely restricted . No ! Knowledge of its location is non-existent . Durkim , no one knows where Star One is ! No-one at all ! So , if Lurgan 's coordinates are correct Star One is somewhere in there . Which makes it about the only thing that is . At least we 'll recognise it when we see it , even if we don 't recognise it when we see it , if it 's the only thing that 's there , if you see what I mean . - Oh , shut up , Vila . - I 'm just trying to help . What do you think , Jenna ? . It 's riskier than it looks . These coordinates are not precise enough . And however they built Star One it 's not going to be so big that we can 't miss it . We 'll probably have to search . It 's a long way out , Blake - a long way from the edge of the galaxy . It 's infinity . You 're asking us to plunge out into infinity . Now come on , Cally , that 's a slight exaggeration . Is it ? . What , the space between the island galaxies ? . It 's the nearest we 'll come to infinity before we die . If anything goes wrong out there we won 't have a prayer , because nothing and nobody goes out that far . I hadn 't thought of it like that . The Federation went out there . We 've only got Lurgen 's word for that . And we didn 't even get it first hand . There is only Lurgen 's word . Everybody else who knew is either dead or amnesiac . One clue . Just one , and we have got it . Why are you listening to this drivel , Blake ? . We can take Star One ; let 's get on with it . Very stirring . When did you become a believer ? . Are you just going to sit there ? . You have led them by the nose before . 'Scuse me , are you going to answer her question ? . Show me someone who believes in anything and I will show you a fool . I meant what I said on Goth , Avon . We are not going to use Star One to rule the Federation ; we are going to destroy it . I never doubted that . I never doubted your fanaticism . As far as I am concerned you can destroy whatever you like . You can stir up a thousand revolutions ; you can wade in blood up to your armpits . Oh , and you can lead the rabble to victory , whatever that might mean . Just so long as there is an end to it . When Star One is gone it is finished , Blake . And I want it finished . I want it over and done with . I want to be free . But you are free now , Avon . I want to be free of him . I never realised . You really do hate me , don 't you ? . When we have dealt with Star One , I will take you back to Earth and then the Liberator is mine , agreed ? . Agreed . Assuming the others go along with it . Why should we ? . Yes , why should we ? . It 's all a bit high-handed if you ask me . Liberator is approaching sector nine . Navigation computers now require further instructions . Well , do we look for Star One ? . We 'll finish what we set out to do . Nothing else is settled . - Are we fanatics ? . - Does it matter ? . - Many , many people will die without Star One . - I know . Are you sure that what we 're going to do is justified ? . It has to be . Don 't you see , Cally ? . If we stop now then all we have done is senseless killing and destruction . Without purpose , without reason . We have to win . It 's the only way I can be sure that I was right . That you were right ? . Course for sector eleven is laid in . Detectors on full range . All readings are clear . Weaponry system on standby . Standard by six , Jenna . Run course program , standard by six . Confirm boundary . Confirm Liberator is now crossing the theoretical boundary of the galaxy and is entering intergalacticspace . Increase speed to standard by twelve . There 's no doubt in your mind that he was telling the truth ? . None , Supreme Commander . We didn 't rush him . He was telling the truth all right . Very well , interrogate the rest of his team just to make sure , and try not to kill them . [ DOOR OPENS ] Yes , Durkim , what is it ? . I find that just a little distracting , Supreme Commander . What 's all this about ? . - Time to defend ourselves . - Against whom ? . Each other . Now what is it you want ? . Quickly , you 're wasting time . - There 's an emergency meeting of the High Council . - I am aware of that . I 've been summoned to appear before it . You put Headquarters on full security restriction . I can 't get off this satellite without your direct clearance . No . 'No ' you agree with what I 'm saying or ' no ' you refuse my clearance ? . Both . Now get back to your work . I am still waiting for your theories as to where Star One may be located . That summons is a Presidential Order in Council . I have to go . Space Command no longer recognises the authority of the President or of the Council . I don 't think I understand . We are the only force capable of handling the present emergency . I doubt if even we can do that . The President and those members of the Council who are unable to accept the realities of the situation are even now being arrested , as are those of our own people whose loyalties may be ' divided ' . At a time like this complete unity is an absolute essential . There isn 't enough data . I can 't even guess where Star One is . Then I suggest you try harder . Or I might think you 're part of the plot . - Plot ? . - Obviously someone is trying to destroy the Federation , now perhaps it 's you . Why would I want to do that ? . 'Why ' is always the most difficult question . At the moment I am more concerned with ' how ' . - Is she involved ? . - You know her ? . Her name 's Lurena , I think ... Isn ' t it ? . Ah , we were acquainted ... You were more than just acquaintances . That 's a long time ago . She emigrated to one of the frontier worlds . She 's on Star One . She can 't be , it 's unmanned . The systems are automatic . A group of scientists and technicians elected to spend the rest of their lives refining , checking and guarding the systems . Knowing they could never leave , never come home ? . That 's appalling . Inspiring , surely ? . In the best tradition of selfless devotion to the Federation . That 's your answer then . Some or all of them have changed their minds . No . They were all screened and conditioned very carefully by our best psycho-manipulation teams . None of the group could attempt to damage the systems , identify the location , or contact anyone outside Star One without going obviously insane . How can you be certain of that ? . The head of the psycho-manipulation team has just finished , ... ' reassuring ' my interrogators . So whatever is happening on Star One is happening against her will . There 's nothing I can do . You get back to work , Durkim . She may still have a chance . If we can find her in time . May I offer you my personal congratulations , and loyalty , Madame President ? . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Supreme Commander ? . - What is it ? . Blake and his crew . The strategy programs have all come up blank on the possible courses they took . - Run them again . - But , Supreme Commander . Run them again ! I will not be President of a ruined empire . What are you doing ? . What are you doing ? . Just a routine check , Lurena . Is that why you 're using a laser probe ? . I 've been watching you , Stott . I know . Your behaviour has been very suspicious for some time now . Forgive me , Lurena , but , well , we 've all noticed that you seem to be under some kind of stress . There was nothing wrong with that control circuit ; I checked it myself an hour ago . That 's why I was checking it again . You think I don 't know what I 'm doing ? . I 'm afraid that 's what we all think . Someone 's been tampering with the systems , it can only be you . Your conditioning , a reaction to it . You 're not to blame . You 're ill , that 's all . Stay where you are , or I 'll kill him . We only want to help you , Lurena . Please , put down the gun . Yes , you 'd like that wouldn 't you ? . Stay where you are ! Do as she says , Parton ! I see it now , you 're all in this together . That 's impossible ; you know that 's impossible , look Lurena . You 're all against me . All of you . Whispering , plotting behind my back . You want to kill me . - We want to help you . - Don 't move ! Please , Lurena . Get after her . Find her before she does any more damage . And don 't bother to bring her back . Just kill her . I was right ; we should have done it as soon as we knew . - I didn 't realise how far she 'd got . - Now she 's running around loose . Well at least we know what to expect , anyway . And after all , what can she do , alone ? . She is the last one . This way ! - Anything on the detectors ? . - No . Jenna , how long before we reach Lurgen 's coordinates ? . Eight minutes . If there 's anything there it should be showing by now . Perhaps Star One doesn 't come within detector range until we reach the coordinates . Our detectors are better than anything the Federation have got . We should be able to see it by now . I think we can . There , at the extreme edge of the range . What is it ? . The readings say that it is a star . Small , pale and very dense . A white dwarf by the look of it . You couldn 't put a computer complex on that . Could you ? . - Hardly . - Does it have a planetary system ? . Probably not a system , more likely a single planet . A single planet orbiting an isolated , dying star . - Star One . - Seems reasonable . Have they found her ? . We 've been through all the control sectors , searched the storage rooms , living quarters . Maybe she went out onto the surface ? . She won 't last long if she has , there 's nothing out there for her . - Better send a search party anyway . - We can 't waste any more time on her . - Do it ! - Shall I call off the search down here ? . Leave three to continue , send a party out onto the surface , put the rest back to work . Don 't be insolent . Maintenance takes effort . If we could revert to ourselves ... No , not while she 's free . If she realised , her conditioning might break down completely . [ LOUD CLATTER ] Zhokov , I 'm sorry , I ... - Put the planet on visual . - Confirmed . Looks like yet another garden paradise . Surface conditions ? . The atmosphere is breathable . Surface temperatures are low . Calculations suggest that they rise above freezing point only during daylight hours at the equator . - Good . - It is ? . You like dead planets with dying suns ? . I do when I 'm looking for a complex underground installation . Jenna , program a course to orbit the planet 's equator . You don 't have to explain it to me ; I only came for the ride . With surface conditions like that where would you build the main installation ? . Course program laid in . Maximum scan , Cally . Look for anything unusual or out of place , sudden temperature variation , anything . They 're bound to have left some clue as to where they put that installation . A door would be nice if you could manage it . - I 'll do my best . - Preferably one marked ' Entrance ' . Ready on the scan , Jenna . Run course program . Confirmed . Course program running . I have been doing some calculations , if this is Star One ... If it is ? . First catch your computer , but all right it probably is , and that being the case the choice of location is fascinating . - I 'm glad you 're enjoying it . - The nearest large galaxy to our own is Andromeda . - So ? . - So , this is the nearest point to Andromeda . If anyone could cross intergalactic space in less than a lifetime we are now precisely upon the route that they would take . What are you trying to say , Avon ? . I directed the detectors toward the Andromeda galaxy . There are thousands of satellite generators out there , beyond Star One . What ? . Even with the Federation 's resources it must have taken them years . That must be the biggest antimatter minefield ever put together . Minefield , what minefield ? . Perhaps the intergalactic drive has been developed . Question is , by whom ? . A defence zone to keep mankind in , or something else out . Leeth . Leeth ! What is it , Markov ? . The main entrance is open . She must have come out after we did . She followed us out . She can 't have got far then . Spread out , all of you . Keep searching . I don 't like explosives , very crude . Difficult to reason with a bomb . Blake ? . They won 't explode until they are primed . And if it was faulty ? . Bit late to complain to the manufacturer . Scanners are showing a temperature variation . From the pattern it could almost be the door you were talking about . - I think it was a trick . - What was ? . The open door . I think she doubled back . I don 't think she 's out here at all . No , she wouldn 't have been thinking clearly enough for that . I hope you 're right , but we 're not really sure how they function under heavy stress . Come on . Stationary orbit is established and confirmed . Teleport , Vila . - Avon ? . - Yes . Watch yourselves , Blake 's rushing things . I get the feeling he 's not giving himself time to think . Blake is an idealist , Jenna . He cannot afford to think . Down and safe . Defences ? . They 've relied on secrecy , I don 't think they 've tricked the place out but it won 't do any harm to be careful . Let 's look for that entrance . - I thought this place was unmanned . - More idealists . They must have volunteered to be marooned for life . Yes , it makes you proud to be human , doesn 't it ? . - What are they doing here ? . - Making sure everything works , presumably . - What now ? . - Follow them . One door . - As requested . - Well done , Cally . - It isn ' t marked ' Entrance ' . - Nobody 's perfect . [ FALLING GRAVEL ] Avon , it 's a trap . Not a very friendly welcome . Shall we go ? . I 'm sure whoever is in charge would wish to speak with us . - Vila , teleport Cally and Blake , quickly . - Right . Come on , come on . - Avon . - Well ? . There 's no response . What 's going on , where are they ? . Inside . It must be shielded . Do you want to come up ? . - No . - Avon . - What is it , Jenna ? - There 's a ship , it 's coming in for a surface landing . - Have they spotted you ? - I 've got the detector shield up . What sort of a ship is it ? I don 't know , it 's a new type to me . Looks like it 's coming down somewhere near you , though . Do you want to come up now ? No , let 's see who else knows about this place . Are you going to tell us what 's going on down there ? Avon ... Avon ! [ RETROS FIRING ] Vila , I need you in here to stand by the weaponry system . - What about the teleport ? - I 'll put Orac on it . - He 's not as quick as we are . - We 'll have to live with that . You mean they will . Just get on with it . Orac , operate the teleport as instructed . Oh , very well . And check that intergalactic defence zone . I want everything you can find out about it , including why it 's there . - You 're here , then . - Apparently . I was told you would be alone . Obviously you were misinformed . - Who is this woman ? . - She is my mother . May I see your identification ? . What for ? . After all , who else knows about this place ? . I was told you could be difficult . You seem to have been told rather a lot about me . I was interested . I am not unfamiliar with traitors , but the scale of your treachery is unusual . And your insistence on carrying out the final act personally must make you unique . Your disapproval would carry more conviction if you were not going to benefit from my treachery . Now when do I get to perform the final act ? . Which of your hands is artificial ? . This one . Rather good , don 't you think ? . And the eye patch , what happened to that ? . Hold it , touch that and I 'll drop you where you stand . Well , now . T ravis . Fancy meeting you here . Put the gun down , Avon , it 's too late to stop it now . - Convince me . - Be polite and I may let you live . Be informative and I may let you die . You 'll want that after I 've shot off an arm and a leg or two . I thought you were supposed to be the one with brains ? . Brains but no heart . Now talk or scream , T ravis , the choice is yours . My preliminary examination of the defence Zone indicates that it is made up of a network of satellite generators . We could have told you that . Each of which performs a dual function ; namely , to indicate the approach of an intruder and then to destroy that intruder by a powerful anti-matter implosion . So it 's a combined alarm system and minefield . Correct . If I may continue ? He always makes me feel as if I should be taking notes . If I may continue ? The defence Zone is controlled and monitored from the computer complex known as Star One . Ahh . A cursory examination of the relevant Star One systems indicates that this defence Zone is one of a number of such Zones located at strategicpoints on the rim of that section of the galaxy colonised by mankind . Then they are expecting an invasion ? . A hoard of hairy aliens . There is no logical reason why aliens should be hairy . There is no logical reason why people should be hairy . I don 't like this Jenna ; we could be sitting in the front line . I see no cause for alarm . From the design and construction patterns it would appear that the defence Zones have been built up very gradually over a long period of time . My conclusion is that they are merely precautionary rather than a response to some specificthreat . Well if there 's no threat why bother with precautions ? . If the resources are available to eliminate even the vaguest threat , it would seem logical to do so . I 'd agree with that . What do you call a vague threat ? . A contact , sometime in the past , either a communication or a physical contact . - A physical contact ? . - A scoutship , perhaps . A scoutship , perhaps ! Like that one down on the surface now , perhaps ! Zen , put the battle computers online . Confirmed , battle computers are online . Give me maximum available range on the detectors . What do you think is going on ? . Well , they were waiting for T ravis , so obviously he 's expected to take over . Except there 's more to it than that . Yes , the ' final act ' . Well , whatever that is we 've got a final act of our own to arrange . You work your way through the other control rooms . If anyone questions you be arrogant , you 're with T ravis , and he 's about to become Emperor of the galaxy . - What about you ? . - I 'll wait for Stott . As long as he thinks I am T ravis we 'll have no problems . Besides I might find even out the rest of it . I 'm going to set this timer for one hour . Most of the systems have been modified already . The chaos and destruction should already be sufficient to ensure that resistance is slight . - When will you be ready for the ultimatum ? . - Ultimatum ? . Laying out of our terms for the restoration of order . Policy is not our concern , T ravis . It is sufficient to serve . I hope these people will really do as you tell them , T ravis . - They will . - The first one who doesn 't will cost you your head . Don 't move . Damn ! - They 're all dead . - Yes , I can see that . Did you kill them ? . - No . They are trying to kill me . - They have a novel approach to the job . You don 't understand . In here they 're dead , but out there , out there they 're still alive , walking about . - T rying to kill you ? . - Yes . Yes . Look out ! [ GUNFIRE ] What are they ? . Unfriendly . Which is fortunate , really . They 'd be difficult to love . Come on . Nothing . There 's nothing there . I knew we were panicking unnecessarily . Alien hordes , I mean to say . - There they are . - Where ? . Where ? . Just coming into detector range . They 're too far off to be sure . They could be meteors . - They 're ships . - No , they couldn 't be , there 's too many of them . That 's a cloud of meteors . Well , come on Jenna , you can see that , admit it . That 's a cloud of ... big meteors . Very big meteors . And it 's slowing down . They know about the defence zone . Jenna , let 's run for it . Is it nearly complete ? . As you see . Constructing the circuits required to deactivate the defence zone was difficult , but we were able to keep the technicians alive long enough to duplicate their entire brain patterns as well as their physical shape . Their physical shape ? . Why do we still retain it ? . The woman Lurena has escaped . It 's just a precaution . May I ask you an impertinent question ? . If you don 't mind an impertinent answer . I have taken on the shape of your species . I use your words , and yet I cannot understand you . The woman Lurena and the other technicians that were here , these I could understand . But you . Why have you betrayed your own kind ? . Why have you given us the means to eradicate your species ? . - Eradicate humanity ? . - Virtually . Maybe I just don 't like crowds . [ LASERON BLAST ] T ravis ... - You are T ravis ? . - I am T ravis . Then who is this ? . His name is Blake . His name WAS Blake . [ GUNFIRE ] - Where 's Blake ? . - I left him in here . What 's that ? . We seem to have stumbled over an alien invasion . Which of these control sections handles the defence zone ? . I can 't tell you that . You must know . Now think , woman . I can 't tell you because you haven 't been cleared by security . Well , neither had that ! She 's been conditioned , Avon . She wants to tell you but she can 't . Come on . Your people are well trained . - They serve , as do we all . - How much longer ? . Each of these keys will close down one sector of the defence zone . When I 've connected this last one , you can begin . My one regret is that they 'll never know who really killed them . Why are they just sitting there ? . They 're waiting for someone to clear that defence zone . Do you think Blake knows what 's happening ? . Why hasn 't he come back yet ? . What are we supposed to do , Jenna ? . - Give the alarm . - Terrific idea , who do you suggest we tell ? . - Servalan . - Oh now , wait a minute . I just hope Blake understands why we betrayed him . Orac , I want you to punch through a message to the strategy computer in Space Command headquarters . I want you to tell it that there 's an alien battle fleet estimated at six hundred ships about to enter Federation space . Give it these coordinates . Tell it that the information comes from Blake on the Liberator . Can you do that , Orac ? . I would remind you that I am not a communicator . Your carrier beam is the fastest way to contact Servalan . That is not the purpose for which it was developed . Do it , you useless bunch of junk . You got us into this mess , " No cause for alarm " you said , or have you forgotten ? . I have passed the message , as you requested . The Space Command strategy computer is now registering the data . It is finished . Now you can open the way for our fleet to enter . The final act . Information . One sector of the defence Zone has now been deactivated . [ GUNFIRE ] [ GUNFIRE ] [ GUNFIRE ] Avon ! - How bad is he ? . - Bad enough . Is he dead , Avon ? . Is T ravis dead ? . [ GUNFIRE ] He is now . Are you ? . I 've had better days . We must get him back to the ship . No , the aliens were closing down the defence zone . There must be a fleet out there . We must warn the Federation . From the ship . The charges , Cally . We cannot blow this place up . Humanity is going to need all the resources it can get . All the charges are set , Blake , they 'll blow in ten minutes . We can 't stop them now they 're primed , it 's too late . - Well get them out onto the surface . - In ten minutes ? . - T ry , Cally . Help her , Avon . - You . Do what you can for him . - When did this come in ? . - It showed up on the strategy readout . All right , Durkim . Red One mobilisation . You believe it ? . All fighting ships to make maximum speed . Patch this office into the fleet coordination suite . Well , get on with it ! - How many more ? . - Three . How long have we got ? . Two-and-a-half minutes . - I forgot . - T ry not to move about . No , you don ' t understand . There 's another explosive charge . Look , lie still . You 'll kill yourself . They don 't know about it . I 've got to get it out . I 'll get it . Tell me where it is . I put it in section four on one of the panels . - All right . Now lie still . - You 'll have to hurry . Come on , come on . We 've got a minute and fifteen seconds . That 's the last . Move ! [ EXPLOSION ] Flagship Galileo reports galactic eighth fleet under way . Estimate achieve coordinates in four hours . Cruiser Beagle now estimating rendezvous in three hours and seventeen minutes . Flotillas fourteen and sixteen confirm four hours and eight minutes . But what happens in the meantime ? . I gave him my word . To fight off that fleet until the Federation get here ? . - That is what I promised . - Why , Avon ? . Why not ? . They are under way , they 're moving towards the gap in the defence zone . - Zen , put it on visual . - Confirmed . Well ? . Zen , battle computers to calculate intercept course and strike ranges . Confirmed . Put up the radiation flare shield ; clear the neutron blasters for firing . Neutron blasters are cleared for firing . - Zen , put up the force wall . - Confirmed . Why didn 't you stay in the medical unit ? . Couldn 't you bring yourself to trust me just this once ? . - I thought I might be able to help . - In that condition ? . - All right I 'll go back . - Can you manage , alone ? . Yes . Avon for what it is worth , I have always trusted you , from the very beginning . Flotilla seventeen estimates two hours and six minutes . Battle cruiser Newton reports coordinates achievable in one hour and seven minutes . One minute to strike range . We can ' t hold all of them . They can ' t all come through that gap at once . Stand by to fire . - Avon , this is stupid ! - When did that ever stop us ? . Fire !

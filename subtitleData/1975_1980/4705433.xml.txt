 Thank you . Tell me the bad news first . Your headaches are from the same source as Vila 's stomach cramps and Avon 's back pains : over-stress . Rubbish . I 'm all right . No , you 're not . None of us are . We 're all in an early stage of fatigue shock . Too many crises . Too many calls on our physical and mental reserves . All of us are dangerously exhausted . We 're also a long way out and still running . Why ? . We lost those patrol ships ages ago . We lost everything ages ago . Nothing comes this far out . So we 're free for the time being anyway . This is freedom ? . I 'm going blind staring at these detectors . Why are we here , Blake ? . We need rest soon . Absolutely right . What I wouldn 't give for a week at one of the old Federation Rest Centres . Sensory ecstasy hours , pleasure machines ... You have to accept these findings . I accept them . But where are WE going to find a centre that will take US in for a month 's rest and rehabilitation ? . Well , that shouldn 't be a problem . What 's the point of being famous if you can 't get a last minute booking ? . Information : Manual detectors are showing Federation freighter on collision course . Vila ! - Repeat : Federation freighter on collision course . - He 's right . Zen , how far away ? . Five hundred spacials . - Course and speed for avoidance ? . - Standard by one-half . Vector one one Zero . Jenna . - Standard by one-half . Vector one one zero . - Estimated nearest on that course , Zen . One hundred and fifty spacials . Will the freighter have us on his detectors ? . Negative . Freighter is operating minimum scan . What 's a freighter doing this far out ? . He 's in Zone Eight already . Where the hell is he going ? . Zen , plot of the freighter 's course ? . Freighter 's course is 1 04 grid . That 'll take him into Zone Nine ! So we are free of the Federation . Persistent , aren 't they ? . Let 's just get out of his way . It was you that asked the question , " Where are they going ? " We 're hiding , already on the edge of the spiral rim . He 's going further out . Zen , give us a course and speed where we can observe out of range of the freighter 's detectors . - I 'm sorry I mentioned it . - Aren 't we all ? . The freighter 's present course will take it into Zone Nine in four hours at present speed . Where in Zone Nine ? . The freighter is on course for the only habitable planet in Zone Nine . Which is ? . Code-named horizon . " Horizon " ? . Code-named by whom ? . Data was obtained via Federation cipher . Data also suggests that it is visited annually by a Federation supply freighter . Carrying what ? . There is no information . - What are the surface conditions on Horizon ? . - Negative information . Population ? . - Negative information . - Is there ANY information on Horizon ? . - Negative . - Is the information on Horizon classified ? . - Negative information . - Well , that was a whole load of nothing . - Course , please . - Maintain present course . - If you insist . You 're not going to follow the freighter all the way to Horizon ? . Why not ? . I 'm curious . Oh , you are curious . Well , I 'm glad we have a worthwhile purpose . Doesn 't it interest you a little ? . No . There 's nothing out there . We are on the edge . Even Zen has nothing on it . That could mean anything . An experimental war zone , anything . That freighter 's gone to Horizon for some good reason . Which is more than you can say for us . - How is the lesson ? . - Difficult . Well , Orac isn 't exactly the ideal teacher . I 'm not exactly the ideal pupil . That is because you are too easily distracted . Planet visual is now available . - Still holding course , Standard by Two . - Freighter 's speed ? . Time Distort Six . - Freighter 's planetfall ? . - Twenty-three minutes at present speed . - Any course correction ? . - No , hold course as plotted . Holding course as plotted . Blake , I 'm tired . Can I go on automatics ? . No . Who knows what we might run into ? . What 's that ? . Whatever it is the freighter has sailed right through it . It doesn 't mean we will . Pull back . Blake ! The force wall is activated . Zen , have you any information on Horizon 's defences ? . - Negative . - There 's a surprise ... [ CLATTERING ] Orac , what 's going on ? . The Liberator is being attacked . The force wall has been activated . We are quite safe , for the moment . Glad you think so ... - What is it ? . - Judgment Day . It 's a magnetic barrier . Get out now . I told you it could be an experimental war zone . Ohh , I think I 've got the bends . I have , I definitely have . - Zen , check systems status . - Confirmed . The magnetic barrier must have triggered automatically . The freighter was impervious to it , its fuselage must 've been demagnetised . Ours hasn 't . If it hadn 't been for the force wall , we would be a cloud of agitated atoms . I wish I was a cloud of agitated atoms ! Stabiliser shot . Now keep still . What was that ? . One-third adrenalin , two-thirds soma . Soma , eh ? . I think I 'll bottle it , make myself a fortune . He 'll be sleepy now for about half an hour . That will be nice . All systems intact . Energy loss from force wall 0 . 1 7 . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Jenna . - Do you need any help ? . How are you feeling ? . - Fine but ... - Stand by , I might need you . [ DATA TRANSFER CHIME ] Zen , was that permission to land ? . Affirmative . It 's all negative , the whole thing . Jenna , stay on manual . Speed Standard by half . Right . Are you going down ? . Not yet . Zen , what 's the freighter 's position ? . Freighter approaching landing site on horizon . Scanner grid reference 1 1 4 . He 's landing . Now we can be off , right ? . Jenna , stationary orbit . Then switch to automatics . Wrong . Zen , plot us a standby course out of here . You DO want a standby course out , don 't you ? . Yes , of course I do . Thank you , Avon . Standby course being prepared . - Read out . - Confirmed . Cally , what 's the medical situation ? . I 've told you : we 're all over-stressed . We 've been in space flight and space crises a long time . What about the old adrenalin and soma ? . That 's the trouble . We 're practically living on it . What we need are some natural relaxants , non-stress situations for a start . You know , we still have nervous systems . I wonder what Horizon 's like . It might be just what we need . You 're not going down there ? . Yes , I think I will . Jenna , I want you to come with me . Right . Gan , take over , will you ? . - But I could come . - No . Zen , take us to teleport range , two miles from the landing field at grid reference 1 02 . What are the surface conditions ? . Detectors indicate that surface conditions are tolerable , breathable atmosphere . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Teleport range is confirmed . All right Gan . Anything on the detectors ? . Not a thing . We 're all alone up here . Make sure we stay that way . I 'll try not to drop off . Well , that 's all right , assuming they haven 't got a fix on us from the ground by now . No , it 'd be raining plasma bolts if they had . Why exactly are we going down ? . The Resistance needs a base , Jenna . Thank you . Somewhere to operate from . And this could be it ? . It 's as good as any other . We know the Federation only visit it once a year . It 's on the edge of the spiral rim . Oh , hell , I 'm tired of running , Jenna . We must get at least one planet behind us . And why are you taking me with you ? . I trust you to back me . Thanks . But there 's more to it than that . You were very deliberate . Covering the angles . How do you mean ? . Avon might run . But not without a first-class pilot . He plays the percentages . Unlike you . I am ready if you are . Put us down . Down and safe . Can 't see anyone around . Out . Come on . [ LOW HUM ] ... right when she says we 're out of condition . What ? . I said " Cally 's right when she says we 're out of condition . ' " Guard . Strangers in Theta Section . Take them . Yes , sir . Theta Section , quickly . Careful . - What are they doing ? . - Mining , I suppose . Liberator , there seem to be some sort of mines here . Federation guards everywhere . We 'll keep in touch . What are those things on their wrists ? . Some sort of communicator , sir . Bring them both to the palace . Remove the communicators first . Yes , sir . What 's happening ? . Nothing . They should 've called in again by now . Maybe they found a Rest and Rehabilitation Centre and they 're lying there , soaking up the sunrays . You 're fit again , I see . Oh , I never felt better . I 'd be happier if this vitamin solution had a slug of soma in it . Any chance , Cally ? . What ? . A slug of soma , from the medical supplies ? . I think they 're in trouble . - You just think so ? . - I feel it . Wonderful . We have all the resources of Zen , Orac , the Liberator , and you FEEL that they are in trouble . You do not FEEL it , you REASON it . They have not called in ; therefore they must be in trouble . You don 't have to be telepathic to know that . Oh , come on , Avon , give the girl a chance . I 'd say she knows a few things that even you don 't understand . Well , I 'd say so , anyway . A fifth-grade ignorant , and you would say so , would you ? . Well , I never had a chance , did I ? . I chose the wrong parents . - I 'm going down . - You can 't do that , Cally . They are in trouble . Someone must go down . - I 'll go . - Gan 'll go . And Vila will go with me , won 't you Vila ? . Will I ? . It 'd be stupid to go on my own . And you wouldn 't want to send Cally in your place , would you ? . Probably not . What about you ? . - What about me ? . - Why don 't you go ? . - YOU are expendable . - And you 're not ? . No , I am not . I am not expendable , I 'm not stupid , and I 'm not going . I 'll get the guns . Ohh .. Who are you ? . Who are YOU ? . Why have you come here ? . I don 't remember being given a choice . Who are you ? . I 'm Ro . I rule this planet . Do you ? . I thought it was a Federation colony . I dislike the word " colony " . Which word would you prefer ? . I rule here , and you 're my prisoners . I dislike the word " prisoner " . - Oh ... - Are you all right ? . Blake . Your name is Blake . How did you get here ? . How did you get through the barrier ? . I 'll ask you again . Is this a Federation colony ? . I am my own man . I 'll have you killed unless you answer my questions . You sound like a Federation man . - Are you against the Federation ? . - What do you think ? . I think you are , yes . Does the Federation frighten you ? . Of course not . Then you must be part of it . You 're Resisters . You are , aren 't you ? . No one resists the Federation . - I don 't want to hurt you . - You already have . Others may do more . You 'd be wise to tell me . Be sensible . What others ? . The ones that came on the Federation freighter ? . What do you know about them ? . I 've been stuck in this pesthole for two years . Two somewhat unproductive years . Not my fault . You are the Colonial Service representative . Ro is not easy to deal with . When he was a pupil at the C.E.C. I found him quite malleable . Yes ? . I think you may find he 's changed a bit since then . He 's not exactly a pupil now . And you 're no longer a teacher . I think you 'll find my relationship with Ro is unchanged . To him I shall always be a respected tutor ; just as to you I shall always be a respected superior . Kommissar . Ro . It has been too long . An unlooked-for pleasure . I welcome your return to my planet . I would 've come sooner , pressure of office . And we are far from the Federation 's heart ? . But not from mine , which pains me that all is not well with you . In what way , Kommissar ? . The quotas have fallen far short of what we had hoped . The Assistant Kommissar will have put this to you , I think ? . He has . Well , we can talk about that . He also tells me you have visitors . Yes . Show me . [ ALERT CHIME ] The man 's called Blake . How did the spaceship get here ? . Something triggered the shield . It should 've been destroyed . Obviously , it wasn 't . Then plainly they have a force field of some kind , very advanced technically . What do you suggest , Kommissar ? . What else have you found out about them ? . There are others on their ship . I think they 're Resisters . Really ? . I 've heard of people who resist . I 've never seen one before . This could be interesting . Let us begin . With your permission , of course . I take it I have your permission ? . Yes , of course . Ah ! Sorry . Down safe , in a sort of cavern . We 'll climb out and find a better view . I 'll call back every three minutes . Out . [ HYPNOTIC DRONE ] Look at me , Jenna . Concentrate . The whole idea is to disorient you . It doesn 't seem to help . When they ask questions , pretend you 're dizzy . I AM dizzy . Concentrate ! They can 't keep this up for much longer . Jenna ! All right , you can stop . She 's passed out . So you 're a Resister . Some malfunction of the genes , I suppose . It throws up a Resister about every hundred thousand . Mostly they 're detected in infancy . I was a late developer . And the young woman ? . Oh , don 't force me to repeat the treatment . Bring the girl round . The damage to her will be extensive and permanent . You don 't care , I see . Very well . Double the input of the disorientor . It 'll kill them . Before we know anything about them . They 'll talk before then . Of course , the decision is yours . We await your orders , Ro . Hang on , Jenna ! - What is it ? . - I thought I heard something . Oww ! All right . All right , I 'll talk . I 'll talk . To you . The people work in your mines as slaves . What is the death rate ? . - It 's high . - But not unacceptable . As you say , Kommissar . Why do you listen to this man ? . He is a servant , a lackey of the Federation . Send him home . But the Federation are our friends . The Federation have all planets in slavery . You are their representative . You don 't understand . The ore is important to them , that much I understand . It 's important to us all . It 's needed for the latest hyperspace ships that will send men into new galaxies . We 're one of the only two planets with a rich seam of Monopasium-239 . Oh , Monopasium-239 . No wonder your workers die . I wish it weren 't necessary , but only ten percent die , the Primitives . Aren 't they human beings , Ro ? . The Primitives ? . Every one a Primitive , working at the mines this very moment . Except ... When you 're all dead , the Federation will use this planet to extend their empire further . With their new ships , with your fuel . You are digging your own graves , Ro . They code-named this place Horizon . It 's a horizon you will never cross . You see , Ro ? . You see how these people work ? . He tells you we are your enemy . How can that be ? . Without us you 'd be living in caves , as you were when the Federation first colonised you . We may have lived in caves , but we did have our own culture . And our own weapons , which still have their uses . You have no part of that now . You 're one of us . At the Central Educational Complex , you were my most able scholar . The graduation order you wear was my personal gift . I 've not forgotten . I 'm very proud of it , Kommissar . Sometimes you don 't behave as if you are . Behave like a ruler , Ro , not a savage . Now , I want details of the spaceship and crew , and I want you to tell them to land . Not a chance . Sir . - I 'll be back . - Oh , yes , Kommissar . " Yes , Kommissar . No , Kommissar " . They 've made you one of them . You ' re bought and sold , aren ' t you ? . Well , I shouldn 't be surprised . I was told before I came here . Who by ? . Who said that ? . One of your subjects , I presume . He spoke of Monopasium-239 , and he spoke of someone called Ro . His name was Paura . But he didn 't call this place " Horizon " . - Silmareno . - That 's right . The name 's forbidden . You can 't cling to the past . Paura shouldn 't have spoken it . Huh ! He probably thought he had nothing to lose , under the circumstances . Circumstances ? . He was on a Federation convict ship . Paura ? ! . ? . But I was told that ... What were you told ? . He was on a training course . We were on the same course . It led to a Federation prison colony - Cygnus Alpha . Only Paura never reached there . He died . They dumped his body in space . He was my friend . He must have misbehaved in some way . That 's not my fault . I think it is . You know it is . - Oh . - Jenna . Oh , my head . - What is it ? . - Plain water . From a stream . Probably full of lethal bacteria . Thank you . It tastes all right . You want some ? . Thank you . You are a human being after all . My people are poor and ignorant . I 'm helping them to better themselves . How did your father die , Ro ? . What ? . In a Federation prison colony too ? . No . In an accident . Paura told me that your father would never have made his people slaves as you have done . You 're lying ! Paura wouldn 't have said that . He was my friend . He understood the needs of my people . Perhaps better than you do . Ro . Two more have been taken . They 're being dealt with . What about these two ? . Put them to work . It 'll soon bring them to their senses . They 'll be begging to help us before three time units are up . What 's your name ? . I 'm Selma . I 'm not one of THESE people . I was to marry Ro . So what are you doing here ? . The Kommissar advised him to send me for training or whatever they call it . I refused to become what they wanted so I was sent here . How long have you got to stay here ? . Until I accept or until I die . And I shall die . In thirty time units from radioactivity . Food . Leave it ! One handful , one at a time . You . Now you . I thought you 'd forgotten her . No . Is it true my friend Paura died on a prison ship ? . No , of course not . - The Resister said so . - Yes , I heard the report . - How did my father die ? . - You know how he died . You wouldn 't lie to me ? . Of course I wouldn 't lie to you . We are as brothers , you and I. What about the other two ? . What did we get from them ? . One of them needed two darts ! There was no telling when he 'd regain consciousness , so I had the guard hang him up as a warning . The other one ? . He 's in here . He 's a common thief , he confessed at once . The spaceship is protected by a force field but the man is ignorant , he knows nothing of its technical capacity . What are you going to do with him ? . Put him to work . It seems he 's never done any in his life . Work ? . Orac , where did you get this information ? . I was instructed to obtain anything relating to the planet . The data was obtained by cross-referencing prisoner and execution lists . It is standard procedure . I don ' t see that it makes any difference now . Blake could find it very useful . A little late , surely ? . - They aren 't dead . - How do you know ? . - I know . - Yes . I tell you , I know . I think we should get out . I have a standby plot . I can put the ship on auto , Zen can fly us out . We can get away , Cally . - I 'm going down . - You 're a fool . Avon , I 'm going down . This information could be vital . Listen . The others have vanished . They didn 't even have time to call in . The only possible conclusion to draw from that is that they are dead . They aren 't dead . This is what I 've been trying to avoid all my life . Don 't worry , it won 't last forever . So you say . Down . There 's no sign of anyone else . I 'll keep in constant contact . You 've got thirty time units . This stuff 's radioactive . What ? . Pick that up . It 's even worse than I thought . Look . - Nothing to report yet . - Make it every half-minute . Right . Orac , have you obtained any further information on the planet Horizon ? . - No . - Why not ? . - Is that a serious question ? . - No . Please do not waste my time . Cally . Are you there ? . Are you there ? . Cally ! And then there was one . Orac , no further information is required on the planet Horizon . I think it 's time to leave . Was it , was it you ? . Were you the executioner ? . Your companions are still alive . I feel it . You killed him . You killed him because he would not obey you . What is she talking about ? . She 's a mystic , I think . I 've seen this amongst my own people . Rubbish . That stuff belongs to your tribal past . His father . You killed his father . - We 're wasting time . - No ! She 's deranged . It 's the poison from your darts , it 's affecting her . How could she know about my father ? . She 's never seen him , never heard of him . How can she know he 's dead ? . A guess . Movo knew you for what you were . She knows his name . He killed your father . He did it with his own hands . And take great care ; he will kill you unless you kill him first . Take her to the others . Let her use her mystic powers on them . T reat her gently ! She has great gifts . You know I sometimes think you 're still half savage after all . Perhaps I am . She 'll be dead soon . They all will . Yes , I know . I must make a decision about Selma . If she is to die , it mustn 't be there , like that . She is a bad influence . She was dismissed from the Federation Training Complex for disobedience . She tried to make trouble here against the Federation . It is best to leave her where she is . You 're forever telling me to behave like a ruler , when I do you say I 'm wrong ! Yes , that 's true . Very well . Tell them to release her . But don 't blame me when you find it 's a mistake . I will decide . IF I decide she is to die , I 'll order it to be done quickly . Have you sent the girl off ? . Yes , sir . She makes me uneasy . - Superstition . - Oh , I realise that . Goes very deep with some , I know . Then how did she know ? . Obviously she 's had access to the records at some time . Kommissar , why don 't we report all this to Federation Central Control ? . - No . - It 's the logical thing . Is it ? . Is it ? . Well , for one thing , they 're out of signal range . All we could contact from here are some units of Space Security . - They could relay your message . - They could . There are certain to be details of these Resisters in the central data banks . Then we would know what we are dealing with . You 're very thoughtful . Simple loyalty , Kommissar . I would not wish us to overstep the bounds of our duty here . No . We must not do that . Then I think I must advise Central Control in all our interests . No . I don 't need the central data bank . I already know who they are . Blake and his crew are the most sought-after criminals in the galaxy . - You 've known that all along ? . - Of course . Then why haven 't you done anything ? . The reward for each of them is generous . Almost as generous as the reward for their spaceship . I have been out of touch . Besides , I want to tame Blake myself . If he breaks , the others will . He will give us the spaceship . It will be a great achievement . And we get the reward ? . I get the reward . What do I get ? . My continued support . - What about Ro ? . - Ro will do as I say . He 's showing signs of rebellion . He is not the man his father was . - When do they let up ? . - They don 't . You . Come with me . Where are you taking her ? . Does it matter ? . Can 't be any worse than here . Unless she 's going to die . I want to talk with the Kommissar . If I go alone , can I pilot the Liberator indefinitely ? . With the help of the automatics , of course you can . - I know that . - Then why did you ask the question ? . I didn 't . How long can I maintain myself ? . - Is that a question ? . - Yes . We have concentrated food for one person for a thousand years . - And our power is self-regenerating ? . - Affirmative . Can you plot courses to keep out of the range of any known spaceship manned by the Federation ? . The battle and navigation computers can handle that perfectly adequately . - I asked if YOU could . - Of course , should it be necessary . Failing that , we are powerful enough to resist all but an attack by three Federation pursuit ships at once . - Is that a question ? . - No . If we go now , we can sail the universe for as long as we like in reasonable safety , provided we keep out of everybody 's way and we do not do anything rash . No data available to answer the question , if it was a question . I put it to you as a possibility . I request the odds . The odds would be 3 . 5 to 1 on survival . Therefore I do not need Blake ; I do not need any of the others . Is that a question ? . I do not need anybody at all . Is that a question ? . I must ask you to be more specific . Shut up , Orac . As you see , Selma is restored to her proper status . And she can stay here if she 's willing to be sensible . You , too , can be restored to civilisation if you 're willing and sensible . I 'm glad for her . And for you , Ro . Congratulations . I 'm sure your father would have approved . You asked to talk to me . My assistant is ready to take a statement . I 've no statement to make , simply a proposition . And what is that ? . Keep me . Take me back to the Federation when you leave Horizon . Let the others go . Otherwise , Liberator will stay out there . And when you try to get away in your slow freighter , it will destroy you . - Can you do that ? . - Oh yes . Let them go . Let them all go . They mean us no harm . We are at your command , Ro . Please , Ro , please . No . Not yet . I am the ruler here . Send him back to the quarry for now . Come along . You heard the ruler . I 'll think about it . I said I 'll think about it ! Well done , Ro . They 're brave people , and they 've chosen their own way . You were wrong about Blake , the Federation doesn 't frighten him . [ DATATRANSFER ] Zen , what was that ? . A message from the Federation freighter on the planet horizon . What did it say ? . Decode . It is in Federation Code 9 . Message reads , " Top priority signal to any Federation pursuit unit , from Kommissar , planet horizon . Request assistance . Ruler of horizon unreliable , am disposing of him . Rebel spaceship at grid reference ten by thirteen W-Z . Request you destroy this spaceship at once . A lso inform Federation Central Control of this action . Await confirmation . ' " - Has anybody else picked it up ? . - Negative . [ DATA TRANSFER ] Decode . From Federation Pursuit Flotilla Thirteen , to Kommissar , planet horizon . Message reads , " Coming to your immediate aid . Regret cannot relay your message to Federation Central Control . They are out of range . Planetfall , two hours from now . ' " How many pursuit ships in Flotilla Thirteen ? . Three pursuit ships . What do these detectors look like ? . Logicwould suggest they are camouflaged , in plants . Does logic suggest somewhere you can put me down without my being detected ? . - Difficult . - But ? . - There is a place . - Then get on with it . Activating . Marvellous . Well , well , well ... So I 'm not alone after all . Missed . It 's a fault on the scanner , that 's all . No , it 's been switched off . All the scanners in the palace are off , everyone has fled . There is no electronic communication anywhere on Horizon . You know what that means . They 've got everything under control . Are you just going to let them kill you ? . And me ? . Who said we were going to die ? . Those people in the spaceship , Ro , you have one of their bracelets ? . No , guards at the mines have got them . We must try and contact them ; they 're our only chance . Ro ! No , I can 't leave the palace . You go . - But what about you ? . - Go . Now ! - I can ' t . - You must . I command it . Orac , teleport us now . What now ? . I want the exact teleport coordinates on that palace . Ro . All the scanners are off . Why 's that ? . So I can 't call my guards for help ? . Selma tried to run away . Did you know ? . - Where is she ? . - Here . Let her go . She 's no good to you , Ro . None at all . You must be rid of her . She should not have been brought back to the palace . You are , I think , mistaken , Kommissar . She means us no harm . She knows things about the Resisters nobody else knows . She 's worked with them . They 've told her things about the spaceship . We can still capture it . She knows nothing . Ro , remember our work together , the theories I taught you , the strategies . Now they must be practiced . You know we must question her . I tell you she knows nothing we haven 't already been told . That we can find out . If not ... - What do want of me ? . - Tell her to help us . All right . Why not ? . Now you 're beginning to act like a ruler . - I try , Kommissar . - Of course you do . I don 't want to be a savage again . Of course you don 't . This way . Sit down , Ro . The minimum . No , please . Ro told you about their communicators , didn 't you , Ro ? . Yes , it didn 't seem important . Very well . Now , Selma , when you were in the mine , what did the Resisters tell you ? . Nothing ! - We need the truth , Selma . - Nothing ! Nothing ! - The truth , Selma . - Nothing ! They didn 't tell me anything ! She 'll die if we do more of this . The pain will kill her , won 't it ? . There 's no organic damage , but the pain will kill her , yes . Do you care ? . No . You must have felt something . You showed nothing . That means you are learning . Yes , I hope I am . - Have you got the coordinates yet ? . - It takes time . - There may not BE much time . - Then stop distracting me . You 're right . I 've been foolish . I belong to the Federation . I 'm glad you 're coming round to the truth , Ro . It would have hurt me to eliminate you . - You were thinking of that ? . - Oh yes . But we are as brothers . Even so . For the good of the Federation . The Federation . We should be getting back . Of course . Can I have a moment ? . I 'm still shaking . My hands are sweating . It can affect one like that , the agony of an acquaintance . Excuse me . - All right . - About time . You will die . It 's the death serum . You planned our deaths . I thought you were one of us , Ro . No , I 'm not . Seems I never was . Blake , where are you ? . Those pursuit ships will be here in five minutes . We have to be mobile to stand a chance . We 're a sitting target here . One moment only , Avon . What about the Federation ? . The last of their guards are dying now . They 'll send more , sooner or later . We will fight . - I wish you luck , both of you . - Thank you . You saved my life . While I live , you 'll be welcome on Horizon . Still Horizon ? . You can 't return to the past . - Liberator , teleport now . Good-bye . - Good-bye , Blake . About time . More last-minute heroics ? . I thought that was your strong suit . I have a course ready to go . Zen , position of those three ships on the main screen . Four hundred spacials , closing at Time Distort Six , line astern . Line astern ? . That 's new . A bright attack commander , lining up to hit us in exactly the same spot . Zen , can we withstand a plasma bolt attack from those three ships ? . If they hit the same spot they could possibly destroy the Liberator . Battle computers advise against allowing them to do so . - Let 's get out of here ! - Ready . Wait . We 're already within strike range . At least let 's make it difficult for them . Twenty seconds , then hit it , Jenna . They 'll murder us ! Blake , they might be protected . I don 't think so . And even if I 'm wrong we still have a slim chance . A slim chance , what more could we ask ? . - Jenna , take us out on the standby course . - Where are we heading ? . Later . Just clear Horizon . It was pretty close there for a moment , Blake . Playing the percentages again ? . Zen had nothing on Horizon 's defences . And Federation Control were keeping the place secret . It was reasonable for you to hope that routine pursuit ships would be unprotected , but in future , I would prefer something a little more reliable than hope . I mean , just sitting there . If we 'd got underway , they would have changed course . And we thought we were tired before . I 'll tell you this though : it beats work .

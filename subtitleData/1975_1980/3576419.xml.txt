 SAVIOUR cast director of photography scenography composer costimography director Wait ! Wait ! I 'm sorry , I 'm very sorry people but we didn 't have any offers today . Enough for today ! You can go now ! Excuse me , please ... - Mr . Gajevski , I 'm telling you every day , there 's nothing . Crisis is going on , man . Wait untill things settle down a bit . So for the third time , we urgently ask of of esteemed head board to do something so this editorship could , under normal conditions , fulfill it 's own bussiness . Water-works are so ... - Good afternoon . What do you want ? I came because of that manuscript I gave you a month ago . You rememebr , that novel , " Epidemic " . About the pestilence that spreads around the town like a plague but it 's all alegory for birocracy . - I remember , just a moment . Where were we ? - Water-works are so ... Are corroded so much that they start to leak so that every room stench of dampness and became inappropriate for work and dwell . Excuse me , but can 't you see the situation we 're in ? I just want to know will you publish it or not . Unfortunately , I must return it to you . It 's not for publishing . But you promised . You said that it 's splendid . I can 't remember , maybe I did . Maybe I liked it , personally . But there are other members of editorship . I think that most of them animadvert that the way the plague is spreading , is showed very unrealistic . Where were we ? - Inappropriate for work and dwell . Yes . Write this too . Floors became so rotten and worm-eaten that they could tear down in any moment now . And they became good for nesting of mice , rats and other vermin . But sir , that in the novel is symbolistic situation , you can 't expect it to be shown realistic like in life . - I 'm sorry . But I really can 't help you . And even if artistic value would be alright , it 's hard that we decide to publish the novel in this kind of situation . You understand me . Good bye . And so , related to everything that was written , we ask that head board send commission soon . Nothing without the money . Now leave us alone , you see we have work ? What is it ? - He 's asking on a tick again . Here you are . And you don 't have to pay me . I think the bussiness will be over anyway . Thank you Mr. Rupcic . So mister writer , all your stuff is here . Madam , I 'll pay you in a few days , be patient . To be patient . You didn 't pay me 3 months and I have to be patient ! ? I could have new lodger , Im poor widow , I live thanks to that money . I assure you , I 'll pay you everything as soon as I get a job . You and job ! You 're looking fot it but you 're hoping not to find it . And for what job are you capable of ? Come on , please ! Let me go ! I am still a lodger here ! Lodger ? ! Alright ! I won 't let anyone to anoy me ! Good afternoon . - Good afternoon . Well miss , how it 's going ? Same as you . Nohow . - What can we do ? Times are like that , people are not interested in books . And I think so . You have many books ? Whole shelves at home . All yours ? No . My father 's . And you ? No . This is all I have . Why did you stand so close tome . When we 're close together like this , we 're going to sold much harder . Both of us . It 's a little bit cold . - Yes . Here . Take this . Don 't , that 's too much . - No , I have so many scarfs , I don 't really need this one . How can I repay you ? - It 's not important . Maybe I will ask you to sell our books sometimes . Here , I 'll give my phone number . 3 , 0 , 6 , 4 . What 's your name ? - Sonja . How much do you ask for this books ? - Whatever you 're willing to give . Madam , please , that girl that was standing here , you know where does she live ? - Son , I know as much as you do . But she often comes here . As your Mayor , I 'm bothered by all the problems of this town . Cause you are life roots of this town , and foundation of the all commerse , economy , industry , food production and culture . You are the bloodflow of this town , it 's driving force . And in the same time , while you make this town alive , it 's not capable to give you even a basic resources for normal living . That 's why , my fellow citizens , ladies and genltemen , I came here , to do everything , with your help , to make you life better and more bearable . But you must realize , that even we who preside this town , encounter so many problems . We 're now in big economic crisis that have overtaken , not just our country , but the whole Europe . But , in spite of that , we invest a lot of effort to solve problems that are of basic importance for you . Where you 're going to live and what will you work . And ' cause of that , my fellow citizens , I call you to follow us , because we 're taking care of your own good . And don 't forget that old folk proverb , " After the rain , sun will show up ! " Madam , did that girl , Sonja , came here ? You remember her ? - I do . She didn 't . If you care so much , you stay here and wait . Maybe she 'll show up . Excuse me mister , I must ask you to sleep on some other place . Here is strictly forbidden . You think I 'm doing this because I like it ? I know but I am park keeper and I must warn you . But if police finds you here , you 'll end up in jail for drifting . Let them come ! At least I 'll sleep on expense of the state . Is that you Mr. Rupcic ? Mr. Gajski ! What are you doing in that uniform ? Well , I closeed my bussiness because of the debts . I entered in public service . It 's much safer that way . Paycheck is certain . What can we do ? Times are like that . Alright , I 'll find another place , I don 't want to get you in trouble . Wait ! Well now ... I know one place , but comfot is not that well . What comfort do I need ? And don 't tell about this to anyone . And just for night or two . Or I 'll be in trouble if someone hear about this . Don 't worry , Mr. Rupcic . Here ! Abandoned building of the Central Bank . 260 rooms are completely empty . Building is sealed but I know how to enter . No one comes here ? - Just some officials , occasionally . But no one at this time . Not there , here . Entrance is a little bit odd but that 's the only way to get in . Help me . Come on , pull it up . Just come after me . You see . Who knows can easily find the way in . Just don 't tell anyone . - Don 't worry . I won 't go further . You can settle yourself as you wish . And like I said , only for night or two . Alright . Thank you Mr. Rupcic . Central . Can I help you ? Well ... I need one number just I 'm not sure that ... I 'll connect you with group A. Group A. Controled numbers . Hello , how can I help you ? I need number of one girl . Her name is Sonja , I think that she lives with her father . 3064 . - Yes ! That 's her number ! Thank you ! Hello . Daddy , see this miracle ! Phone is broken but it rangs . Hello ! Hello . Who 's there ? Is that you Sonja ? I 'm the one from the market , I was selling books . You remember ? It 's unbelievable , it 's strange how we can talk . Where do you call from ? - From the abandoned Central Bank . I got your number by a miracle . Please , tell me where do you live ? Chestnut Street 97 . Hello . Hello ! Chestnut Street 97 ... Salute to the Saviour ! Salute to the Saviour ! My ladies and gentlemen , I 'm happy to see that our mission is becoming a reality . The one who weren 't on our side are joining us now . The one who are against us , diseappear one by one . That day is not far , when we 'll be only us and no one else . And now tell me , what is with professor Boskovic ? He will die tonight , Great Saviour . His adress is Chesntut Street 97 . His daughter is with him . Somebody 's upstairs ! - Get him ! Get him ! It was right here , sir . I was standing upstairs . Chief , there 's no trace of what we 're looking for . No trace of any banquet or someone 's presence . But that can 't be true , they were really here . I saw them . Come with me , please . Let 's go ! Now you 'll see where they stock their food . But it was all here . And that with professor Boskovic who maybe they killed already . I found his apartment ravaged , this morning . I 'm sure that we , at professor 's apartment , if he exists at all , find everything in order . Believe me sir , this is serious . And they are danger to us all . Dear sir , it 's already late noon , I 'm on my feet from the morning , and I have busy night ahead of me . Go and get some sleep . Enough . Enough ! Stop it ! I know very well who you are and what you 're up to ! But it won 't work ! That 's some spy ! We should show him ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Let that man go . I will take care of him . Come on , let 's go . I am professor Martin Boskovic . Professor Boskovic is murdered . I 'm not yet . I apprehended that they 'll attack me so I prepared for evacuation . Your phone call was a signal that was time for that move . Why you didn 't notice the police ? You saw how they believed you . Here we are . I moved to a house of my friends who now live abroad . Please . Come in , come in . This is my daughter , I believe you already met her . Do come in . Mr. Gajski , what are you doing ? What 's your occupation ? I studied philosophy . Then tried to write but with no success . I don 't do anything really , I am unemployed . Philosophy ? Have you read a book by Ert Ertrus " Warehouse of Rat King " ? No . Book was written 400 years ago in Germany . Author was burned on a stake , in Bremen . Like you 're not some writer , I 'm not some scientist . People don 't believe me . Or they laugh when they hear what am I doing here . But maybe we could together , joined , you and me ... Science is not my bright side . All the same . I 'm offering you a position of my assistant . If you accept , you must live here . It would be my honour but I 'm afraid I would not be some help . Now you 'll excuse me . So , can I consider you as my assistant ? - You may , professor . We 'll talk later about what is ahead of us . Ert Ertrus . " Warehouse of King Rat " . Rat . That cunning and dark creature can rule the man 's mind . It rules the secrets of underground where it 's hiding ... Has a power of transforming its own shape . They have hands , legs , wear suits , have faces , eyes , movements so that they 're not differ from human at all . Pest , hunger , wars , raids relish them . Then rats gathered , secretly transformed , working as people . You 'll speak with them , not knowing ... what they are . They steal and sell with gaining profit understandable for a honest man . They decieve with burnish of their suit and liquidity of their talk . They loot and burn , spy , they 're surrounded by wealth . They eat and drink a lot . And most of all , they love power . In time of crisis , Savoiur comes among them , Guinean big rat . He gives them power that humans can 't understand . Have a seat . What do you think ? Did experiment worked ? If you 're looking a rat poison , then , it is . I 'm not looking for a weapon for rat animals , but for a rat people . Can you believe , that night in the bank , you were not surrounded by people . What if they were rats disguised as people . I 'm trying to produce indicator B. I named like that the matter I found that can trace , even smallest trails of rats in people . And kill them . Chemicals that I need , disappear over the night from the stores . If you wish , I can find them . Think about it . That 's not harmless . Working with me , you 'll draw attention of the whole crowd . They 'll try to kill you more than they try to kill me . And why you need that so much ? Great number of rats appear at my place , so I need it to ... Why didn 't you say that right away ? And I noticed that . So many of them have breeded , lately . You know , I 'm renting rooms ... - Alright , alright ... I must warn you right away , expences of supplying ... Don 't worry , I 'll pay for everything . - Alright , alright ... Come in two days . We 'll work something out . Sonja , what 's a matter ? I don 't know . On the shelf , between medicaments . Some rat . Those eyes , it looked right at me . I feel so sick . I never felt something like this before . Come . You 'll be better . What happened sir ? You have rats here like this is a dump . What rats in our restaurant ? Real rats , you idiot ! There . Sonja is not in danger anymore . Like nothing happened . People in the restaurant . You remember how did they look like ? Everything seemed normal . Now he 's obssessed with devouring of his own kind . Rat cannibal . Tonight we 'll put him in the sewer . This one first , then more of them . Why did you kill those rats ? - That 's our job , man . We 're from public utilities . Sonja . What are you doing here ? Well , I came outside . I was worried about you . Sonja . Sonja ! Did she really looked like me ? Yes , very . What was she wearing ? I can 't remember . Saviour . When he disappears they become what they were . From your story I can 't understand what you wanted to say . Is it a murder or an accident ? First you say that professor Boskovic could be bitten by some animal , some rat . Then , that he 's victim of some organization . Either can be true . If someone die when he was bitten by an animal , in criminal practice , we treat that like an accident . But if that animals have collusive plan of acting then that cannot be an accident . If I remember well you already ... took us to the Bank to show us seemingly headquarters of some secret underground organization . Yes . Just then I couldn 't even imagine that members of that organization could be rats . And that so many people are already in their service . Dear sir , you 've gone far . Something new ? - Nothing you haven 't seen yourself , chief . Pack everything . - Alright . Receive my most sincere condolences miss . Sir . Let me express my deepest condolences in this sad moment for all of us . Who are this people ? - I don 't know . I never seen them before . Let 's go . Let 's hurry . Please , keep this between us . I have notice myself that some strange things are going on there lately . That 's not isolated case , mister Mayor . They are holding some significant points in town . And that with the chief of police ... - You leave that to me . I 'll take care of that . Tell me , can you continue to work on that indicator by yourself ? Maybe I could . I learned a lot from the late professor . Just as you know ... - About the chemicals , don 't worry . I 'll get them . We should stay in contact . And please , when you come the next time , don 't come on the main entrance , come on postern . Through the backyard . Announce yourself to my personal secretary . That 's person of my full trust . Come . I 'll show you . I 'm sorry . In 5 minutes I have a very important meeting . I really don 't know can I thank you enough . You will , when we succeed , youngman . Good bye . - Good bye . You know what this means ? Your father produced that indicator after all . They came to destroy this and they all died . We don 't know what professor did that night . Should we call the police ? - No . Only the Mayor can know about this . I 'll remove these . I don 't know anything about that . I can only notice mister Mayor that you are here . What was your name again ? Gajski . Ivan Gajski . I 'm sorry . Mister Mayor is not even here . He just went out . And if you can 't wait , write what you have to say , fill the application and give it to me . Like he couldn 't left me some note . We should go there again tomorrow . Who knows what 's going on there . And maybe he 's dead too . Salute to the Saviour ! Salute to the Saviour ! Please sir , tell me where 's the man who came in to your apartment . Who are you ? What is it with you ? Maybe he 's here . Sir , can you explain to me what do you want ? Who are you looking for ? He 's here somewhere . What is it ? Who you 're looking for , sir ? Listen , who gave you the right to do that ? We should call the police . Not the police , you see that man is insane . We should call hospital . Please , help me . He must been escaped here . What are you looking for , anyway ? Monster-man , a rat ! Go to hell , sir . If rats bother you , catch them by yourself . Be reasonable . That 's humans with the powers of the rats . If I kill their leader , they 're done . Maybe you have a rat in your brain , eh ? What are you doing here ? - He 's looking for some kind of rat . Take him to asylum . - Come on , go away . And you ! Come with me ! - I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm not going anywhere ! - Sir ! Hey stop ! What are you doing ? Leave that man alone . Mister Mayor ! Gentleman is my friend . Get me a car . - Yes sir , mister Mayor ! Everything is alright , it 's alright ! - Mayor . He got away . And I almost got him . Who , Mr. Gajski ? What is it with you ? Saviour . Here . This belongs to him . Fantastic ! Why you did this by yourself ? Why haven 't you noticed me ? I was looking for you . Your secretary didn 't tell you ? My dear Mr. Gajski , she was one of them . I 'm surrounded by them . I cannot be sure anymore . Don 't be surprised that I 'm alone here now . Lately , I often get out at night by myself . I feel that something is going on . I know that I have to do something , just don 't know what . Professor Boskovic could save us , he knew everything . Actually , he produced indicator B. Well man , why didn 't you tell me that right away . You 're the saviour of this town . Car is here , mister Mayor ! Let them take this gentleman home . We must meet tomorrow , come in my office . - Thank you mister Mayor . To the Flower Square , please . Great Saviour , they told me to guard the Bank . But they haven 't told me that you have meetings there , by night . Man was without a roof over his head and I just wanted to help . There . That " help " is giving you away . It proves that you remained what you were . Execute it ! No ... No ! What is it Mr. Gajski ? Like you didn 't expect that this could be me ? Now you see that we are everywhere and on every position . In spite of your indicator . Don 't be afraid Mr. Gajski . We 're more human than any of you . Our bond with them just gives us supernatural power . You 'll have a close encounter with us , like you friend , Mr. Rupcic . Or daughter of professor Boskovic , that time in a restaurant . Every our man had gone through this . That bonds us . It gives us power . Soon or after , everybody will be with us . From today there will exist another Gajski , beside you . Ours . And loyal to us , like your fiancee . Have you noticed any difference between yours and ours Sonja ? Ours is more regardless , perhapse . But she 's more of a woman . Mr. Gajski , like you don 't have nothing to say . We are old friends . We 'll see each other more from now on , besides , we 'll have the same cause . Execute it ! Ivan , don 't go home ! They 're already there . They ocuppied everything . I barely manage to escape . I know who you are . You 're not Sonja . Ivan , what 's wrong with you ? Ivan ... Who was messing with this ? No one . You know that I don 't understand that . Come . Come ! I 'm dying and there 's no hope at all for you . As long as new Saviour appears . And he will come . In the time of crisis . He will come , soon maybe . He will come .

 Yippee ! Whee-ee-ee ! Commander Koenig ? Tony , you 'd better see this . John , what the hell 's going on ? 'John , what 's going on up there ? ' - Uh-oh ! - ' Come in , John ! ' - ' John , can you hear me ? ' - Look , Ma , no hands ! Do you read me ? ( Koenig continues laughing hysterically ) 'Baby ! Look out ! ' He went to investigate a reported increase in the neutron count . Haven 't had so much fun since I burned Grandma 's wig ! ( Continues laughing ) Medical Unit , stand by . You really gotta try this ! You have to fly this baby to believe it ! It 's terrific . ( Continues laughing hysterically ) Hallelujah ! There are angels everywhere ! - He 'll hit the nuclear waste dumps . - He 's too low ! He 'll hit the domes . John , get out of there ! That 's lethal ! # Come and join us ! Come and join us ! # Come and join our happy band ! # Ha-ha-ha ! Yahoo-oo-oo ! Whee-ee ! Alan , take over Eagle 10 by remote . Medical Unit to Launch Area . Crash Unit 4 to Launch Area . He 's deactivated the remote control . ( Alarm ) If he hits a dome , he could cause a nuclear explosion . No , that would need stimulation with atomic fuel . He 's gonna crash . Alan , get over there . Take two nuclear physicists . Ehrlich , Bartlett . ( Koenig ) ' Whoo-hoo-hoo ! ' Keep your heads down . Big Daddy 's coming in ! ( Tony ) ' Get outta there ! ' ( Alarm ) 'Moonbase Alpha status report , '1,912 days since leaving Earth orbit . Dr Helena Russell recording . 'Commander Koenig , while piloting Eagle 10 , 'became suddenly irrational and unresponsive . 'He crashed in the area of the nuclear waste dumps . ' - What 's the radiation count ? - Negative . All clear . He was lucky . Will he be OK ? He 's got severe concussion . It 's a feedback complex , Maya . It takes brain impulses , modifies them , feeds them back . It 's like a brain massage - electronic . It is still experimental . Then you don 't know the side effects . Is it worth the risk ? If I DON 'T take the risk ... - What happened to him up there ? - I don 't know . Tony , I have something on the screen . I 'm on my way , Sahn . Hang in there , John . Come on , Maya . - What is it ? - It 's too far away to tell . Maya ? Sensors pick up configuration of a spaceship . Range ? - 90,210,000 miles . - Heading ? Directly at us . - ( Helena ) ' Medical Center . ' - How soon can I talk to John ? 15 minutes at the earliest . I don 't dare stop the brain complex . OK , thanks . Even at the speed of light , it would take an hour to reach Alpha . Where is the monitoring crew that went to the nuclear waste area ? They 're on their way back . Tony ! Range 40,000,000 miles ! It 's impossible . It 's exceeding the speed of light . 32,000,000 miles . We 're lucky . Damage to that nuclear dump was minimal . - Not a trace of radiation . - The nuclear waste is stable . And it 'll stay that way , too , for centuries , unless ... Magnify it . What do you make of that thing ? That is a Superswift . - No , it can 't be . - But it is , I tell you . Superswift never got off the drawing board . Not before we left Earth . Things have changed . Physics hasn 't changed . It 's faster than the speed of light . Sure in hell looks like the drawings of Superswift . It seems like human technology to me . It could be from Earth . Whatever that is , let 's not get sentimental about it . Tony , it 's moving in to land . Weapon Section , arm all lasers . Open a channel . Moonbase Alpha to spaceship , identify yourself . Repeat , identify . Moonbase Alpha to spaceship , identify yourself . Repeat , identify . They 're trying to come through . It 's Guido ! Hi , little brother . It 's my brother Guido . Guido ! - Tony ! - Guido ! I saw you on that screen . I didn 't believe it ! Still keeping that guard up , Carter ? I 've still got the Houston Base Championship ! Only cos I wasn 't here for a rematch . Doctor Shaw ! Helena , my dear ! Diana ? Peter , darling ! Look , I 'm a captain now . I want a little respect from you . Well , that cuts both ways . How 's your handicap ? Hi ! I hate to have to tell you this , but I can put a shot in the crater from 1,600 yards . How 's your handicap ? - You 're looking so fit ! - Green grass and fresh air . Well , hello ! Hello . Could you tell me where I could find Dr Ben Vincent ? - Mm-hm . You 're his sister , right ? - No . His daughter ? - No . - I know . You 're his grandmother . No . That means you 're gonna tell me what I 'm afraid of . Yes , I 'm his fiancee . Well done , sport ! Wonderful ! Did you make that physiotherapy major ? Oh , without your coaching , it was difficult . But I made it . OK . Listen , I 've got a lot of stiff tendons ... around here . Around here ? ( General chatter ) Listen , hold it ! Hold it , everybody ! Try and contain yourselves for a little while . You 've all got thousands of things you wanna know ... Tens of thousands ! - .. how are things on Earth ... - How ARE things on Earth ? .. the time it took us to get here , how we got here ... When are we gonna get back ? .. and when you 're gonna get back - all the whys and wherefores . Just give us a minute or two to get our breath back , then we 'll answer all your questions , everything you wanna know . Thank you . - What is that ? - Come on , I 'll introduce you . Maya , this is my brother , Guido . I 'm his elder brother and smarter brother and handsomer brother . Otherwise , he 's a poor second . - Put it there , old buddy . - Certainly , old buddy . Is it always like this between you ? No , I usually dominate him . Fantasy ! I always stole his girls . He could never get any of his own ! Oh , come on , I 'll introduce you . Helena , this is Peter Rockwell . Hello . How are you ? He 's a pilot . We were going to get married when my tour of duty ended . I 've heard a lot about you . I thought I 'd lost her for good . Never underestimate the extent of human inventiveness . You haven 't changed . You knew each other before ? Dr Shaw was my tutor at Medical College . He taught me everything about being a doctor . - What do you do ? - He 's a cab driver . I captained the craft we came on . - It 's a miracle you made it ! - You ... How did you attain a speed faster than light ? Little old Earth has progressed . Physics came up with a new wrinkle . We can make loops in the continuum . He doesn 't know what he 's talking about ! Rhinehart made the breakthrough at Cambridge . Cambridge ... England . Massachusetts . We can travel anywhere in the universe now . The journey back to Earth is just a bus ride in Earth time . We 're just the scouting party . When the big transporters arrive , it 's " goodbye , Moon " for everyone . I can 't wait ! Maya ? She 'll be all right . - How 's Momma ? - You know Momma . She 's making you a mound of pasta the size of Vesuvius ! And the sauce ! I know , everything in it but holy water ! How did she take the news that we 'd blown out ? Three days of weeping , then two weeks of phoning the White House to demand action . - That 's Momma ! - Then she didn 't believe it . The scientists were talking out of their navels . - It was simply a matter of time . - And Poppa ? He went quiet ... and he got thin . Yeah . Sure . - And where did you meet ? - Oh ... somebody 's party . You look a little lost . Can I help you ? Perhaps later . Trouble ? I bet she 's been looking for John since she got here . She knew him before ... I did . That gives her territorial rights ? Diana Morris is like the Fifth Cavalry . Wherever she plants her flag is home . I 'll leave you to it . Thanks a lot ! Helena , darling ! We haven 't had a proper little chat . No , we haven 't , Diana , but there 's lots of time for that . You poor dear . It must have been terrible here . It 's obviously been awfully wearing . I think space is generally very hard on women . How long is it that you 've been ... ? What is it ? Navigating officer ? Still , there 's something to be said for a marooned society . It does limit the men 's choices . And women 's opportunities . I always make my own opportunities . There are some of us who still prefer THEM to come to US . Clive , you 're always with a camera ! Is there anything you don 't tape ? This is for the record . We 're watching history being made . There 's only one thing ... you won 't be in the picture . How do you get along with John Koenig ? In a small community , everyone has to get along with everybody else . - Cosy . - Isn 't it ? Do you find him ... interesting ? He 's everything you said he was . I 'm glad you can second my opinion . As a matter of fact , he 's much more than you said he was . There are depths to him that I 'm sure you never found out about . I must look for them at once . Where is he ? At the moment , he is linked to an Ellendorf quadrographic brain complex . Oh , very wise of you , darling . - Hi . - Hi . ( Machine beeps ) This is a medical monitor . These are strategically placed so we can check on our patients . It 's a good rational set-up . Hey , why don 't we get out of this heavy traffic , huh ? I know a nice , cosy spot . Ben ... ? Ben , I have some important questions to put to Louisa about the shape of things back on Earth , the configuration of the modern female form . Darling , where have you got John on this brain machine ? I 'm dying to see him . Can 't I see him ? I know he 's longing ... Ben ! Sandstrom was trying to kill Koenig . ( Machine beeps ) He 's all right . The cycle 's completed . If it had happened earlier ... - What happened ? - Are you all right ? - I 'll tell you what happened ! - Ben ! - You tried to kill Koenig ! - No , Ben ! I have to kill Koenig ! - He 'll destroy us ! - All right ! - He could destroy us ! - Come on , here we go . Easy . What about fashion ? What 's everybody wearing ? Well , there 's a lot of silver about . Necklines tend to be a little lower . Skirts tend to be a little higher . Now , where do you think you 're going ? Well , I ... I didn 't want to disturb the big reunion . What are you talking about ? Well , I ... I don 't want to disturb everybody . Don 't be ridiculous ! You couldn 't disturb anybody . - Come on . - No , no . Um ... I 've got to check some computers . Maya ... come here . Guido , what kind of propulsion boosts you past the speed of light ? A development of the ion rocket . But I never knew you were shy . I do LOVE your make-up ! A-hem . Diana , this is Maya . How do you do ? Maya is a Psychon . She 's the last of her species . I 'm not surprised . Tell me , how do you manage ... to keep so fit up here ? A little bit of this , a little bit of that . We manage . - Do you jog ? - What ? Jog . Oh . I do think exercise is SO important to a man , don 't you ? I mean , I think it 's so important to his physical wellbeing . ( Whispers ) Maya ! I do a little yoga myself . You can get into some lovely positions . What happened to the Commander on the Eagle ? Could it have anything to do with Sandstrom going berserk ? In what way ? Well , could it be infectious ? Contagious ? I found no evidence of virus or bacteria in John 's blood samples . Helena ? How do you feel ? - You tell me . - You look great to me . You 're fine . Wait a minute , wait a minute ! Let 's get this off of you . Come on . - OK . - Gently . Oh-h ... - All right ? - Yeah . - Eagle 10 ... ? - Totalled . What happened , John ? How long was I out ? - Just over five hours . - Five hours ! You 're lucky . Your skull took quite a bang . Without this complex , it could have been weeks . What happened ? Everyone must have seen what happened . Rocket malfunction . Well , that 's what it was , wasn 't it ? The investigation crew found no evidence of rocket malfunction . That leaves pilot error . That 's terrific . ( Helena ) John , we don 't know what happened . You seemed to have lost control of yourself . I only remember going out to check that neutron count . - John ... - Yeah ? A rescue expedition has landed here on Alpha from Earth . What ? From Earth . They came in a Superswift . A Superswift ? Tony 's brother Guido captained it and Dr Shaw is here . Dr Shaw ? I told you all about Dr Shaw . Course I remember Dr Shaw very well . - And Sahn 's fiance Peter . - Sahn 's fiance . - And Professor Hunter . - Professor Hunter . And ... Diana Morris . Diana Morris - well , well . Now , Helena , please don 't even joke about that barracuda ... - Only you 're not joking . - No . You really mean it . - You mean , somehow something worked ? - Yes . You mean they got it licked ? - They 're really here ? - Yes ! - We can get back to Earth ? - Yes ! - Helena , Helena ! - Yes , yes ! - Helena . - Oh ! OK , keep the arm straight ... then get your eye on the ball ... I didn 't know you had such a big thing going with Diana Morris . I didn 't want to bore you . I didn 't think she was your type . - Childhood sweethearts . - She was never a child ! We actually met in the jazz ballet group at MIT . - You liar ! - I 'm no liar ! 'The Commander 's on his way . ' John , good to see you back . John ... darling ! Don 't come near me . Stay away ! John , this is my brother , Guido . What 's the matter , John ? This is Guido , my brother . Are you all right ? Stay back . Don 't come near me . What 's the matter , John ? Alan , what 's the matter with YOU ? Tony ? Helena ? Maya , what 's the matter with you ? ! - What 's wrong with him ? - He was fine . He 's as erratic as he was up in the Eagle . John , they 're friends ! Tony , they 're not your friends ! They 're ... horrible ... ugly , hideous ! - Take it easy , John . - Listen to me . - Listen ! - You 'll be all right . LISTEN ! - Just calm down . - TONY ! - Clear the Command Center ! - John ! - Stay behind me . - ' Weapon Section . ' Arm all lasers . Destroy that alien ship ! Weapon Section , ABORT laser guns . Damn you , Tony , I 'm in command ! John , it 's all right . - Stay clear , Tony . - John , no ! 'Status report . Supplemental . John Koenig continues his odd behaviour . 'He has no awareness that he acted strangely before his crash . 'With reluctance , I put him in restraint . ' Gotta get out of here . Things to be done . Gotta find answers . John , take it easy . It 's all right . The entire base is in danger . Helena , can 't you do something ? - I 'm trying . - His blood pressure 's up . Gotta get out . Helena ! Yes , John ? Now , please , just take it easy . Those things out there , what are they ? What do they want ? John , will you listen to me ? Those are people from Earth . You know some of them . They 've come to take us home . They 're not people ! Are you blind ? John , trust us . Why can 't you see what you 've got out there ? Dr Shaw , would you please assist me ? Get that out of here ! Get that out of here ! Get that out of HERE ! Get out of HERE ! GET IT out of HERE ! I 'm sorry , Dr Shaw . Of course , Helena . He 's the last man I would have expected to flip out . Let me out of here , please . I 've got to get out of here ! No , Helena , don 't . DON 'T , please . If you didn 't let Ben Vincent out of your range , Koenig would be dead now . HE interfered . He escaped the Eagle crash we arranged and now this . He 's hard to kill , this John Koenig . We can arrange to control him . Why fear him ? He is a strong leader . His mind is no longer under our control . Something has interfered . He 's in position now . There IS resistance . I need help . Could that medical apparatus have aggravated his condition ? The complex was tested extensively . Ellendorf 's results were quite impressive . I just don 't know , Tony . His mind ... Oh , it wouldn 't just cave in , not John Koenig . ( Electronic chime ) Command Center . Maya , we 've got trouble in the Records Lab . Can you explain his wild ride on Eagle 10 ? And his claim that Guido 's a monster ? Tony , emergency at the Records Lab . - Maya , what happened ? - He 's jammed the lock on his side . We can 't control them all at the same time . Concentrate on Kander . What 's happening ? Kander 's trapped inside . Stand back . I 'll blast it open . Alan , he 's got the emergency oxygen supply full on . You 'll blow the place to pieces . Tony , I can get through the air vent . She 's a Metamorph ! He 's dead . ( Coughing in background ) Tony , we 're sorry about this tragedy . I know this is a bad time , but we 're getting out of the range of Earth . If we 're going to get you all home , we have to address ourselves to the problem . A pilot ship will take three people . If there 's anyone you 'd like to suggest ? Tony , we should get to it as soon as possible . Yeah , OK . ( General chatter ) All right , everybody . This is it . Are you ready ? I think I 'm more nervous than anybody . Ehrlich . Yippee ! Bramwell Beach , here I come ! Bartlett . Carter . You did it , Alan ! Fantastic ! Home at last ! Well , you win some , you lose some . - My eyes clear ? Pulse rate normal ? - Yes . - Blood pressure down ? - Yes . - Do I seem rational to you ? - Yes . Fine . Now , will you believe that when I look at our friends from Earth , I don 't see what you see ? What do you see ? Something hideous , something ugly , horrendous and hostile and deadly . Now , please , listen to me , PLEASE , listen to me . Please , let me get out of here ! No , please , don 't do that . Don 't do that . Please . Please , don 't do that . Look ... don 't you find it strange that all the personnel on the rescue ship are people you know - close relatives and friends ? Don 't you think the odds against that are pretty heavy ? Not really . They 're all volunteers , John . They specifically asked to come . Fine . OK , fine . What about the pilot ship ? You said you drew lots to see who 'd go first . Yes . And Ehrlich , Bartlett and Alan were the winners . That 's right . Now , don 't you find THAT strange ? The three men chosen are members of the radioactive monitoring team ? Isn 't that strange ? John , I drew the names . What 's the matter ? Can 't you see you 're being manipulated ? ! What 's happened to your instincts ? Listen to me ! You 're all blind ! 'Hey , all systems are go here . What 's the hold-up , Alpha ? ' 'Tony , the pilot ship is ready for lift-off . ' Tony , no . Don 't let them go . Don 't let them go , please ! Helena , don 't let them go ! No ... ( Hissing ) ( Carter ) There it is - Earth . Did you ever see such a beautiful sight ? It 's incredible . It 's only been a few hours . Or has it ? That 's what they said the breakthrough they made was all about - time . Don 't you go away , blue eyes ! I gotta tell the guys back on Alpha about this ! ( Beeping ) Hey , you guys ... it 's beautiful ! Look , it 's beautiful ! Maybe this will convince John - now that somebody has seen Earth again . - Are you all right ? - Terrific . What the hell happened ? I hit him with my stick . ( John cries out )

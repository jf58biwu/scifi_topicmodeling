 'Moonbase Alpha , status report . '1,807 days after leaving Earth orbit . Dr Helena Russell recording . 'A derelict spaceship has appeared in our third quadrant . 'Commander John Koenig 'and Security Officer Tony Verdeschi are investigating . 'Could its appearance be connected with our science officer , Maya , 'developing a high fever of unknown origin , 'which has so far resisted all medication ? ' Mentor ... don 't do it , Mentor ! We must leave Psychon ... Don 't do it , Mentor . We have to ... leave the planet ... - Take it easy , Maya . - Mentor ! Mentor ! Maya ! - Maya ? - Oh ... I 've been having terrible visions . Flames all around me . Volcanoes erupting . You have a very high fever . As soon as we can bring it down , you 'll be all right . Is there anything you want ? I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid , Helena . Where 's Tony ? I want Tony . He 'll be here soon . OK ? Alan , contact Eagle 1 . Ask them to return . I 'm worried about Maya . Will do . San , get Eagle 1 on the big screen and open a channel . Moonbase Alpha calling Commander Koenig . Calling Commander Koenig . 'Commander Koenig , come in , please . ' Go ahead , Alpha . 'John , we 'd like an ETA on your return . ' Helena 's worried . 'We 'll return after we board the derelict ship . ' Assume emergency positions ! Assume emergency positions ! What the hell 's going on ? Alan ? Come in , Alan ! Alan ! Give me a shot of Alpha on the screen . What 's happened to Alpha ? It 's disappeared . Mentor ! It 's happening again ! We 're not on Psychon , Maya ! Hold on , Maya ! What hit us ? We 'll find out ... as soon as we have time . All right , everybody , back to your stations . - ' Maintenance ? ' - How long to restore full power ? 'We have to locate the source of the trouble . ' Can you get Eagle 1 on the big screen ? Alan , I cannot locate them . What did this to us ? I 'm not sure yet . Keep trying . - Nothing . - What 's our position ? That WAS our position . This is our position now . We have moved five light years in a matter of minutes ! Through a space warp ! There 's no chance of the Commander making it back . Unless he can find a window in the space warp . The chances of that are pretty remote . What 's our present velocity ? Back to normal . Get ready to launch a refuelling Eagle . 'Yes , sir . ' Yeah , I know it 's a long shot , but if they find that space warp ... then they 'll need refuelling to get back to Alpha . 'Eagle 1 to Moonbase Alpha . Come in , Alpha ! ' It 's no good , John , I just can 't get a fix on them . There 's only one answer , Tony . They must have gone through a space warp . They could be billions of miles away ! We have fuel for less than a million . It might not make any difference even if we had all the fuel we needed . Yeah . We wouldn 't even know which direction to go in . I 'll help you ! I 'll help you ! Maya , just lie back . Come on . Here we go . Easy . All right , all right . Just take it easy . You 've been delirious , Maya . Yes , I know . The nightmares ... They 're getting worse , they 're taking over . - Ben , prepare a sedative . - No , that won 't do it . Helena , I 'm beginning to lose molecular control . I don 't know what will happen . You 've got to put me in restraints . - I can 't do that . - You 've got to ! I could be dangerous ! Put me in restraints ! Ben , prepare a sedative . OK , put her in restraints , then . - ' Command Center . ' - Alan , I must speak to Eagle 1 . You have to tell her , Alan . 'Tell me what ? ' That shaking . We went through a space warp . Eagle 1 is on the other side of it . We are five light years from our last position . OK , this is just about where Alpha disappeared . We 've matched Alpha 's velocity . And now all we have to do is find that hole in space . You 're the doctor , Helena , so forgive me for prescribing , but you need some rest . If there are any developments , Helena ... What are his chances ? Well , you know John . He won 't give up . What are the chances of his finding that same door in space ? - It depends . - On what ? - On luck . - Luck ? In space ? I guess his chances are a billion to one . Helena , if I can ... Maya ... ! Maya ... Maya , please ! Revert ! No ! Aaah ! Maya ! Please ! I 've got a rest period . Want a coffee ? Hey ! 'Emergency in corridor Level A ! Emergency in corridor Level A ! 'There 's some kind of monster loose on Alpha ! We were attacked . ' - Emergency in Weapon Section . - I heard . Security , there 's a dangerous creature loose on Alpha . 'Take no chances . Put your laser guns on kill . 'Take no chances . Kill on sight . ' 'All non-essential personnel to remain in their quarters . 'This creature is dangerous . I repeat - this creature is dangerous . 'Security - kill on sight . ' Occupant of elevator , please identify yourself . 'Occupant of elevator , please identify . ' 'Security . ' - Elevator 7 , Levels C and D. - ' Yes , sir . ' Helena ? What happened ? You all right ? Maya ... Maya turned into some kind of a space creature . I 'm all right , but there 's no telling what she might do . She 's already been doing it . Alan 's orders are to kill on sight . Alan , you 've got to cancel that kill order ! - Wait a minute . That creature ... - ' That creature is Maya ! 'She can 't control what she 's doing . ' 'Top priority ! All personnel , don 't shoot to kill ! Change to stun . ' Shall we try number 11 ? No , let 's try and raise Alpha on the screen . I guess there are gonna be no miracles today . How about that derelict ? We might be able to use its fuel store if it has any left . You never know . We could get lucky . What have we got to lose ? 'It 's making its way to the upper levels , but we 're staying clear . ' Don 't lose contact , but stay back . Tranquilliser darts are almost ready . OK , but how much do we use ? Too little , no effect . Too much , death . Let 's hope this is the correct dosage . The stun guns had little effect . This has more of a kick . 'Mr Carter , it seems to be making its way to the travel tube . ' The travel tube ? Maya was delirious and hallucinating about Psychon - her father was still alive and she had to save him . Do you think it 's making for the Eagles ? Yeah , and if she gets on to one she 'll be making a one-way trip to a planet that 's no longer there . No ! Maya ! Please listen to me ! Maya , listen . Please , let us try to help you . She 's making for Launch Pad 4 ! Come on ! Cut off the power to the main travel tube . All right , Helena , we 've got her trapped . We 've hit her with stun guns , tranquilliser darts and she 's still on her feet . Oh , boy ... ! What do we do now ? We go in after it . Alan ... If she makes it to an Eagle there 's no way to help her . Come on . We 'll try the alternate travel tube . 'Launching Area . ' Top priority alert . Block travel tube 1 ... Launch Area ? Launch Area , what 's going on ? 'Launch Area , give me a report ! 'Launch Area personnel , can you hear me ? 'Will you give me a report ? ! 'Launch Area ? What is going on in there ? ' Launching Area , what 's happening ? Mr Carter , we 've been attacked ! OK , where 's it gone now ? 'In Eagle 4 . ' It 's too late . The boarding tube 's retracting . - We can 't let her lift off . - I 'll bring her down ! Let 's see what 's going on inside . The anaesthetic 's taking effect . - We 'll bring it in . - Right . - Can 't we stop it ? - No , we have no control over it now . Get the Rescue Unit on the double ! - Get her out of there ! - Quickly ! Go ! - She 's dying . - Can 't you save her ? This species ' anatomy and vital functions are unknown to me ! Well , you 've got to do something ! Maya , change back . Please , change back . That anaesthetic dart really worked . Its metabolism can 't cope with it . The pressure 's in here somewhere . We 've nothing to compare . We 've never seen anything like this before . We 've insufficient knowledge of this species to know what that 's about . We can 't treat its injuries . Just stand here and let Maya die ? Look . The creature 's blood . If we treat it , we could upset the corpuscle balance . We don 't know what the hell we 're dealing with . Helena , how long ago did Maya transform into this ? About 45 minutes ago . You 're unfamiliar with its anatomy . Maya only holds form for an hour . Just wait 15 minutes ! But she doesn 't have 15 minutes . - Ben , will you assist me , please ? - If you operate , you could kill her . At least she 'll have a chance . We 'll make our incision here . If we can stop that blockage ... What if it 's natural tissue performing a natural function ? Let 's find that out . All right . Here we go . Dr Russell , heart fibrillating , pulse erratic . You can 't operate . She won 't make it ! Maya , you 've got to change now ! You 've got to change right now ! Alan , I think she hears me . - Maya ! - Maya , no ! No ! Maya , no ! Stop it ! - Don 't kill him ! - Set to stun ! Oh , my God ! That looks like a docking port . See ? We are getting lucky . - Cut power . - Power cut . OK , we 're locked on . Right , let 's take a look . Tony , check the Power Room . See if the fuel supply is adaptable to our Eagles . Yeah , OK . Obviously a data bank . That Power Room is amazingly sophisticated . It 's way beyond our capabilities . Maybe the answer lies here . Look at that one . It 's a different colour . 'This is Captain Duro ... 'Commander of the Betanon scout cruiser Menon . 'We were twelve parsecs distant from the mother ship Admenon 'when it disappeared into a space warp . 'That happened ... Star Time 12 . 'It is now Star Time 32 ... 'and through all that long period 'I and my crew 'have been desperately trying 'to find that same entry into the space warp . 'We thought that we had pinpointed the exact location 'of entry of the mother ship into the space warp . 'It was after a number of unsuccessful attempts 'to enter the space warp 'that we realised our co-ordinates were wrong . 'There was a fault on our space warp locator . 'Our ship suffered much damage . I set my engineers to work . 'We were very close to attaining the correct co-ordinates 'when there was a malfunction in a power pod 'which caused an explosion , killing all my crew . 'I , myself , suffered a fatal wound . 'In the last few moments of my life , 'I am making this record 'so that if any other intelligent life arrives in this area , 'they will have an explanation of these tragic events . 'The data relating to the space warp locator 'is recorded ... on Cartridge 26 . 'In the burial tradition of my species , 'I have ejected my crew members out into space 'and , at the conclusion of this report , 'I ... 'will join them . ' If it 's any consolation , we know how he felt . We owe him . We owe him for pointing the way . 26 . 'This stage of the operation is critical . 'The data shown must be fed 'into our on-board computer , and linked to yours . 'The correct co-ordinates will be obtained 'by connecting the space warp locator to your computer 'and the Menon 's computer activated . 'The rest of the procedure is relatively simple . ' Simple ? Hmm . I wish we had Maya here . - Well , we don 't . - It 's a hell of a long shot . Yeah . But it 's a shot . Let 's find that locator . - ' Travel tube clear . ' - Check . - ' Life Support . ' - Anything ? - ' It 's not in this area . ' - Check . Attention , Security . All the corridors are clear , travel tubes and life support . Levels C and D are clear . Now , check Levels A and B. It 's got to be somewhere on here . If Maya 's still in control , she 'll be trying to get to Psychon . The launch pads are sealed off . She cannot get to an Eagle . It might take a little time , but we 'll find her . John ... Tony , I 've found it . Yeah , this is it . Let 's transfer it to Eagle 1 and see if it works . John , even if we do break through , we haven 't the fuel to catch Alpha . My hunch is that everyone on Alpha is working on that contingency . Now , come on . San , will you patch me into the refuelling Eagle ? Moonbase Alpha to Eagle 3 . - ' Eagle 3 to Alpha . Go ahead . ' - Gary , what 's your ETA ? 'ETA to rendezvous point - 7 minutes , 12 seconds . ' Rendezvous point - we hope . When you reach it , I want you to cruise the area . - ' For how long ? ' - Until further notice . 'We 've cornered the animal . It 's hell-bent on getting out . ' Right , we 're on our way . - It 's trying to get to Psychon . - If she smashes that airlock ... Explosive decompression will wipe out everybody in this section . You guys set on stun ? Fire . Computer , open the inner door to Airlock 7 . What are you doing ? If that breaks through to the surface , she 'll die instantly . Computer , close the inner door . Ben , I need an anaesthetic gas cylinder at Airlock 7 immediately ! 'Right . I 'm on my way . ' The anaesthetic should have an immediate effect . It had better . There 's nothing . No effect at all . Maya ! It must have an air store like a camel stores water . Yeah ! How long will it last , though ? What matters is that Maya can only hold that form for an hour . - Do you want us to follow you , sir ? - Not yet . Get yourself suited up and wait for a command . - ' Command Center . ' - Have you visual ? It 's approaching area Copernicus of the Copernicus Depression . Its pace has slowed . - Right . - Must be running out of air . Depressurise . OK , John . It should be hooked up to your computer . We have link-up . I 'm going to activate . OK , I 've got all the co-ordinates . Now all we have to do is understand them . All right . I 'm coming aboard . 'The creature is now on a bearing of 2,670 and still slowing . ' Roger , Alpha . There she is . Alpha , we have visual . Alan , look out ! Helena , hang on ! Get out of the way ! Alan ! No , Maya ! No ! Helena ! I 'm losing oxygen ! Command Center , I need an emergency Eagle immediately . - Air ... beautiful . - You 'll be all right , Alan . The creature 's running out of air . If it transforms into Maya , she 'll die instantly . One . Two . Five . Six . Seven . Four . One , down to blue . One , down to blue . - Yeah . - Compensation factor ? Er ... port thruster , 22.2-second burn . Inertia factor ... green plus two . Green plus two . That 's it . Well , here are the co-ordinates . Let 's hope they 're the right ones . Well , if Alpha can do it , so can we . At least she 's still breathing . Barely . Maya , can you hear me ? Change now , Maya ! - You 're not making contact . - It 's been nearly an hour . She didn 't come back as Maya the last time . What happens if she transforms into something even worse ? - Any developments ? - None . Refuelling Eagle maintaining position . They have nothing to report ? Just that they are almost at the point of no return . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Hey ! Well , that 's something . At least we 've got full power again . Alan , look ! I am getting peculiar readings from the refuelling Eagle . There 's nothing on the screen . There is something . Sensors are picking up an enormous disturbance . Sensor 's readings increasing in magnitude . Hey , do you see what I see ? Do I ! - ' Medical . ' - Helena , I have a surprise for you . 'Take a look at your screen . ' Break link with derelict . Pulse normal . Helena ... - The restraints ... ! - You don 't need them . - But I 'm dangerous . - Not any more . All life signs stable . Fever 's gone . How do you feel ? Like I 've been ... riding the tail of a comet ... for days on end . We all do . 'Refuelling complete , Commander . ' Thank you . Tow the derelict back to Alpha . 'Yes , sir . ' - We 're bringing the derelict in . - How come ? 'It 's a long story . ' 'Is there something special about it ? ' Would you believe , a friendly alien ! We believe anything you say . Just get back to Alpha . 'Right . ' Oh , and have Maya stand by to reveal the mysteries of this magnificent marvel . - As soon as she 's awake . - ' She 's asleep ? ' Well , how about that ? We 've been beating our brains out and they 're catching up on their sleep ! The least they can do is get a little relaxation . Right , Helena ? Right , John . Absolutely nothing has been going on down on Alpha . We have been all perfectly relaxed

 'Moonbase Alpha status report , '1,150 days after leaving Earth 's orbit . 'Dr Helena Russell recording . ' During the many months of our space journey , we 've kept a full record of everything that has happened . Our computer is assessing what we 've learned and transferring data to the main computer memory banks . So , our computer is fully engaged , and some non-scientific personnel are having a bit of a rest . Much good that does . What 's wrong ? Don 't you like having an easy time ? It 'd be better if my off-duty time coincided with yours , and it hasn 't since we started this memory rewind . Maybe the computer will pick out some memories of us together and we can learn from the past . I 'd rather have the present . What 's that coming up now ? Change ? - That 's not from the memory track . - No , that 's happening now . John ... Yasko , show me the horizon . We 're changing course . The moon can 't be off course ! That 's impossible . Maya , what 's pulling us ? I have no reading , Commander . Yasko , find something on that screen . It looks the same as it always does . What could be involved in a change of course that we couldn 't read ? - Just one , a gravity source . - Locate it . Computer 's still reviewing the memory . Cancel it . Review cancelled . Gravity scan in progress . Come on . Come on ! I want to know what 's pulling us off course . Predicted position of gravity source ... No prediction . - That 's correct . - I want a 360-degree visual scan . Nothing . It could be a black dwarf . Collision course with a black dwarf ? Evacuation procedure . Medical Centre , prepare to evacuate . Research Unit , prepare to evacuate . All Eagles , prepare to evacuate . Repeat , evacuate . Eagle 10 on stand-by to evacuate command personnel . Check rate of change . Change constant . But rate of pull accelerating . We 're getting closer to whatever 's pulling us , without much time . Evacuate ! Commander . Identify . - Estimates only . - " Estimates only " what ? ! Why isn 't our computer dealing with this ? It 's slowed up . - Is that pulling us away ? - No . It 's a small planet with no more gravity pull than we have . Focus and magnify . Wait a minute ! Intercept ! Eagles 1 and 2 , intercept unknown spaceship approaching Moonbase Alpha . On target . Eagle 1 to Moonbase , we have visual . Are you having abnormal gravity from that spaceship ? 'No , sir . Gravity is normal . ' Eagle 2 , angle ten degrees from me . Eagle 1 to spaceship . Eagle 1 to spaceship , can you receive me ? We are friendly . 'Hello , Eagle 1 ! 'Am I glad to hear your voice ! Eagles from planet Earth ! ' 'Is that , or is that not , the dear old moonie-moon-moon ? ! ' Eagle 1 to spaceship , it is the moon . Identify yourself . 'Eagle , how are you ? My spaceship is a Swift , also from planet Earth . 'I was on a star mission with three other Swifts and a mother ship . 'We left Earth in 1996 . ' Let 's try to check that out . It 's working ! A mission in 1996 , mother ship and four Swifts under Captain Michael . What happened to the expedition ? There was a communications break . Date unknown . 'Swift to Eagle 1 . 'There used to be a base on the moon . 'Um ... Alpha . Is it still there ? Is it manned ? ' 'Moonbase Alpha is operational . ' We 'd be more operational if I knew about that gravity pull . Any data ? No . I 'll check if it 's a real gravity threat , or if our computer 's developed a fault . 'Swift to Moonbase Alpha , Swift to Moonbase Alpha , hello there ! 'Listen , guys , I haven 't seen anybody for so long I 'd given up . 'Tell you what , can I come and have lunch with you ? ' Moonbase Alpha to Swift . All right , come on down and have lunch with us . Weapons Section , this applies to missiles standing by for evacuation , target incoming spaceship , an old Swift . - ' Weapons Section armed and ready . ' - Standing by . - Eagles remain on stand-by . - On stand-by . We 'll investigate Swift . Helena . This is the commander of Moonbase Alpha ! We 're coming aboard ! - There 's no one there , sir . - What ? ! No sign of anyone , sir . - The ship is in good order ? - Yes , sir . But empty ? - Yes , Doctor . - ' OK , fellas , OK . 'You 've had your inspection . You 're well-armed , I see . 'I think you really are from planet Earth . It 's OK . We 're all friends . ' - Where are you ? - ' Just coming out . - ' Where 's your commander ? ' - Right here . 'What 's your name ? ' Koenig . What 's your name ? 'Oh , lady , what a question ! I haven 't got a name . 'No , no , you stay there . 'I 'll come and meet you . - ' Koenig ? ' - Yeah , that 's me . 'And you 're the lady ! ' - I 'm Dr Russell . - ' How are you , Dr Russell ? 'Shall we go into the moonbase ? 'Would you excuse me ? 'Break it up , would you , fellas ? And don 't point , it 's rude . 'Oh ! There aren 't any steps or stairs , are there ? ' No . 'Cos I 'm on wheels and I can 't cope with the bumps . 'Hey , you guys , watch my antenna . 'I 'd better tell you what 's what . Who I am , I mean . ' Yes , who are you ? 'Like I said , Star mission 1996 , 'our mother ship and the Swifts landed on planet D. 'And they died . They just died . 'I 've been orbiting ever since , waiting for another Earth mission . ' Were you a member of the original crew ? 'I 'm only the talking , seeing head . The brain . 'The rest of me is that old computer on the Swift . 'My antenna allows me to move about while still keeping contact ... 'Aagh ! Don 't step on my antenna ! 'It gives me the heebie-jeebies , not to mention a headache ! ' Sorry . - What do we call you ? - ' Like I said , I haven 't got a name . 'There 's only one of me , so I don 't need a name , do I ? ' Brain . 'That 's not my name , that 's what I am . 'The first word I said was " brain " , only I got it wrong . I said " Brian " ! 'Well , that 's a name ! If you want to give me a name , call me Brian ! ' All right , Brian . We wouldn 't wanna get you wrong . 'OK ! - ' Koenig , shall I lead the way ? ' - After you . 'Fine . 'Wheee ! That 's nice ! ' We 've had an odd change of course . Has your computer ... ? - ' What ? ' - Have you recorded it ? 'No , I haven 't . A change of course ? What 's pulling you ? ' That 's what we want to know . 'Is it a gravity pull from planet D ? 'A collision course with planet D isn 't funny . I 'll check on that . ' He can help us . 'Hello , everybody ! How are you ? 'I 'm fine ! I 'm just honky-tonk . I really am ! 'It 's nice to see you . 'I thought I was gonna have to wait for a century ! 'Oh ! How do you do ? 'I can 't shake hands , I haven 't got a hand . 'But you can pat me if you like . Well , go on ! Go on ! 'Peekaboo ! Peekaboo ! 'Oh ! Will you take a look at that trolley ! 'Yellow plastic wheels ! Oh ! ' 'No , I 'm just kidding . That trolley don 't mean anything . 'We 're just good friends . Yellow wheels - eugh ! 'Oh , hey - hey , look , your computer 's the same as mine ! 'Mark 10 holographic programming ! ' 'You know , him and me , we 're compatible . 'Thanks for having me on board . 'I 'll get back and check that change of course . ' What about that lunch you wanted ? 'I haven 't got a digestive system . A couple of kilowatts does me . 'Doctor , would you like a tour of inspection of my humble abode ? ' Thank you , I 'd like that very much . 'Being a doctor , maybe you can throw some light on the death of my crew , 'not to say my captain . ' - I 'll be glad to try to help . - ' Right , on we go . ' Mind if I come along ? 'No ! Why should I mind ? I 'd be delighted ! 'So long , everybody ! Right , this way ! 'Oh , these doors ! It 's so narrow ! ' Well ... what do you make of that ? - I 'm not sure . - What is it ? It 's a self-programming computer . Self-monitoring , too . - Is it alive ? - That 's a difficult question . It doesn 't breathe or reproduce . Depends what you mean by alive . I don 't know what I mean , but that sure made my day ! Tony ... I 've got a bad feeling about that machine . A bad feeling ? Come on ! It 's doing a check for us . We don 't know where we 're heading . Your problem is your brain works like a computer so you 're jealous of that other computer . I have a bad feeling . What are they doing on Swift ? Open a channel . OK . - Red alert ! - No response ! We 've been cut off ! Where are they ? ! - ' Oh ! ' - Where are you taking us ? 'I 'm sorry ! We took off ! Don 't panic . 'Let me be until I get this ship under control ! ' - Let you be ? ! - John , it 's a machine ! - What are you doing ? ! - ' Shut up ! 'Wowee ! 'I 'll just go through for a minute . ' - You all right ? - Yeah . 'Am I all right ? I 've got to be ! ' I wasn 't talking to you ! Where are you going ? ! 'To my pilot console . ' 'Come on in . 'Uh-oh . Just let me trim this course . ' - Trim it back to Moonbase Alpha ! - ' No way ! 'This is where we 're going . ' - Planet D. - ' You got it , lady . Program this spaceship to return to Alpha . 'If you fire that and kill me , the airlocks will open ... 'and you and the lady will be swept into space . 'And if you make a move for the spacesuits , I 'll let the air out . 'So sit down , both of you . 'Sit down or I 'll spit you out ! 'I don 't need air , do I ? ' Let me communicate with Alpha . 'Why not ? Put your gun down on the shelf . ' Why are you taking us to planet D ? 'Put your gun down and I 'll tell you . I won 't harm you . ' - I don 't trust you . - ' Hard luck . 'Put your gun on the shelf . 'Koenig , I can 't eject one without the other . 'And if you go into space , she goes . 'One ... two ... 'Shall I open the airlock and out you go ? 'Put your gun on the shelf near the airlock panel . 'That 's it behind you . ' Let us through to Alpha . 'I 'd give you service with a smile , but I can 't smile . 'Although I do have a very pretty face . ' 'There 's the service ... on the screen . ' There 's no picture whichever button I press ! Try a straight line to the medical centre . Nothing but a mathematical sine wave . Try the memory bank . What date is it ? The same . What diameter is this moon ? The same ? The computer 's either had its memory wiped , or the links to it have been paralysed . 'Moonbase Alpha is blind . ' The brain had the same computer as ours . When it got in here , it somehow gave the command , " Eradicate . " Is that true ? You 've blinded them so they can 't communicate ? 'I guess so ! ' We can 't even tell where the horizon is . Are we on a collision course or going into orbit ? I 've been waiting . What 's going on ? Communications are wiped out . - All of them ? - Yes . What about the computer on Eagle 1 ? It 's functioning , but we can 't get an answer . Fraser , could you fly without guidance from base computer ? I suppose so . The commander and Dr Russell are on that Swift . - I 'll go after them . - We 'll take a whole squadron . 'That 's a good crew , Koenig . 'You know what your boys are showing ? They 're showing loyalty . 'Yeah ! Well , I like that ! I 'm gonna make a note of that . ' 'Hang on , folks , I 'm gonna slow down . 'Watch while I blind those Eagles . ' - No ! - ' Why not ? 'If I don 't , they 'll damage me . 'And if they damage me , they damage you and Koenig . ' Eagle 1 to Eagle squadron , Swift seems to want us to catch up . - It could be a trap . - Circle target . - Let me talk to them . - ' Anything you want . Go ahead . ' - ' Tony . ' - ' John ? ' 'Return to Alpha . ' But they 're prisoners ! 'Yes , but if you don 't go back , your computer will be blinded . 'You won 't be able to get back . ' - We can 't just leave you . - ' You must . ' 'Tell them you 're OK . I got food and drink . Do you want music ? ' 'We 're being looked after . We 're safe . 'Acknowledge command . - ' Acknowledge , Tony ! ' - Command received . Did you check if the moon and planet D are on a collision course ? 'Sure . The moon and planet D are not on a collision course ! ' What course are they on ? 'They 're going in circles round each other . 'And they 'll go on round each other until the end of time . ' 'What is this , some crazy slot machine ? ' 'Slot machine ? ! You plastic pin-brain , you ! ' Eagle 1 return to Alpha ! I want all personnel back on Moonbase ! 'Yes , sir . ' 'You know , what you 've shown , Koenig , is leadership . 'I 'm very impressed . I 'm making a note . ' All communications cut . They can 't see or hear us now . I can guide you . Send all the other Eagles back . We 'll go on . We 've got our own foolproof computer - Maya . Where 's the Swift heading for ? Planet D. I wanna be on planet D , waiting , when that thing gets there . - What 's planet D like ? - ' It 's like the moon . ' Does it have air ? 'Yeah , but there 's a kind of mist that could be poison . 'Oh , come on , folks , be happy ! 'I brought you together here ! 'I 'm offering you all the time in the world . 'Don 't you love each other ? ' - No . - Of course not . 'Do you mind if I test that ? 'I 've got to know . We 've got two airlocks in the passenger module . - ' I want one of you in each . ' - What if we don 't ? 'Well , how about this ? ' - Ultraviolet ! - Shut your eyes . 'Won 't do no good . Your eyes are gonna shrivel up . ' - Turn it off ! - ' Get into the airlock . ' OK ! Just turn it off ! - ' Now , into the airlock . ' - Are you all right ? 'Come on , come on , come on ! You 're all right . 'That ultraviolet never fails . Thank you ! Come along . ' - In there ? - ' Right ! 'That 's fine , Koenig , that 's fine . Now , don 't worry . 'Now you , lady . Into the next one . 'OK , good girl . You 're gonna be all right . 'There 's just something I gotta know about you . 'I 've really got to know . 'Koenig ... 'do you love this lady ? ' No , I don 't . 'Dr Helena Russell , do you love this man ? ' No , I don 't . 'What I 'm gonna do , I 'm gonna let the air out ... 'slowly . 'You see a button in your airlock ? The black one ? 'Do you see the black one ? ! 'Now , at any time , folks , while the air 's getting thinner , 'you can press your button 'and channel your remaining air to the other airlock . 'You get it ? 'Koenig , if you press your button , 'all the rest of your air goes to the lady . 'And Dr Russell , if you hit your black button , 'you give all your air to Koenig , and he can live . ' 'Oh , I gotta tell you , you can 't communicate with each other . 'No way , folks . Ready ? Here goes . ' 'You 're running out of time , folks . 'Wowee ! Simultaneous ! 'You can have all your air back ! 'Oh ! You love each other ! Whoa ! 'Oh , yeah ! Keeping one of you hostage 'gives me an 18-carat gold crunch on the other ! ' - ' Come on , lady , move faster ! ' - I 'm moving as fast as I can . 'I don 't believe you ! You 're going slow ! ' Why don 't you go out to planet D yourself ? 'Because it 's too bumpy . I 'm on wheels . ' - What are you after ? - ' I 'll tell you , Koenig . 'I 've landed within 150 yards of my old mother ship . 'I want you to get aboard the mother ship , 'unload the fuel store , bring it back - ' and install it in my tanks . ' - Fuel ? You have enough fuel here . - ' Enough ? ' - Enough for a thousand years . 'There 's enough fuel on that mother ship to last me a billion years ! 'Koenig , I 'm gonna live forever ! 'And it 's OK , I 'll keep the lady safe for you . 'I know how you feel . 'So no monkey tricks , or you know what 'll happen . ' All right ! Turn it out ! Turn out that light ! 'Well , now , that 's better . ' 'Come on , Koenig ! Keep contact ! 'What are you doing ? Where are you ? 'Report back ! What are you doing ? ' I can 't see him . Visual communication 's not too good on planet D. But call him . - John ? - ' Yes . OK . ' 'He said OK ! So , not to worry , lady . So , who 's worried ? ' - How did you come to be made ? - ' My master Captain Michael made me . 'He taught me to speak and ... he grew fond of me . ' What was he like ? 'That 's him . My father . ' 'Koenig to Swift . I 'm now in the vicinity of the mother ship . ' 'Koenig , what do you see ? What state is the mother ship in ? ' 'Communication indistinct . Can 't see you , can hardly hear you . 'Going around to the blind side of the ship now . Out . ' John ? John ! 'We 'll have to wait . He 's out of contact now . ' - John ! - Tony ! Maya ! Am I glad to see you ! We landed ahead of you , and came aboard . - You see what 's out there ? - Yeah . The crew . The atmosphere 's toxic . Deadly ! They went out without their suits ! Captain Michael - commander of the Star mission . Permission to test the console , Commander ? Granted . Make it fast . I have to get back to Helena . A sine wave . Same response as on Moonbase . That means the mother ship is blind . And that brain is mad . Blinding the computer on its own mother ship ! That 's why the crew didn 't know about the poison and went out . And why Michael had no means of life support . John ... why did the brain kidnap you ? To transfer the fuel from this ship back to the Swift . The fuel ? It wants to live forever , Maya . We 'd better find that fuel . Listen . How do we get at the brain ? We can 't rush it , it 's got Helena . And it has the only working computer here . So , what do we do ? - By breaking its mind . - Breaking its mind ? ! Confusing it . It killed the man who made it . We 'll work on that . I had a good look at Captain Michael . I know you did , Maya . Hello ? What 's this ? Wait a minute ! Captain Michael was working on something . - Does that matter now ? - Yes , it does , Tony . I think I know what this was going to be ! What are you on to ? - How do we get you aboard ? - I can fit into your pocket . Good girl . - Easy , Maya . - Got her ? Let 's find that fuel , Tony . 'That Koenig is taking his time ! ' He has to find the fuel , unlock the core and find a way to get it back ! 'Lady , you don 't know what this means to me ! Is Koenig reliable ? ' He 's reliable . 'There he is ! ' - John ! - ' Have you got it all ? ' 'Koenig to Swift . I 'm approaching with the fuel core . ' 'Have you got it all ? Koenig , answer ! ' - ' Are you ready to receive me ? ' - ' Yes ! Of course I am ! Come on ! 'Wowee ! Good man ! Come on , Koenig ! Come on ! Come on ! ' - Let him decompress properly ! - ' He 's fine ! Come on , Koenig ! 'There , come on ! Oh , you got it ! That 's beautiful ! 'What are ... ? ' Are you all right ? 'Will you cut it out ? ! Koenig , get to the fuel ! ' - Mind if I take off this spacesuit ? - ' No , do it later . Get on with it ! 'Dr Russell , open the hatch there . ' Brian , incidentally , I saw your crew scattered all over the planet surface . Lying dead . 'So they 're dead ? ' And Captain Michael sitting at his command desk . - Also dead . - ' My father ? 'Oh ... Come on , get on with that fuel ! In there ! 'Dr Russell , will you open the hatch ? ' Brian , which end goes in first ? Which end is up ? - ' What ? ! Well , what does it say ? ! ' - It doesn 't say anything . 'Well , any way ! Quit fooling , Koenig ! ' You 're the boss , Brian . 'That 's right . 'Gently . Carefully . 'Yahoo ! Yippee ! 'Oh boy , oh boy , do I feel good ! Oh boy ! 'That fuel - oh , yes , sir ! 'Yahoo ! ' # Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay I like you very much # 'I 'm so happy I could cry , but I wasn 't programmed for crying ! 'It 's the happiest day of my life ! 'I 'm free to roam this universe ! Free to live forever ! 'Stand by for takeoff ! ' Take it easy . Can 't approach too close or the brain might blind us . 'What 's that ? ! What is that ? ! ' A mouse . 'It 's biting my antenna ! Where did it come from ? ' - Planet D. - ' There are no mice on planet D . ' There are now . It 's got a message for you . - ' What message ? ' - A message from Captain Michael . 'What ? But he 's dead ! What message ? ! - ' What message , Koenig ? ! ' - Revenge . 'You don 't have a message from him ! 'What do you think you can do against me ? I control this ship ! - ' I 'm gonna blow you into space ! ' - Why did you kill your master ? 'I did not kill my master . ' - He was sitting at his desk - dead ! - ' I don 't know how he died ! ' He died because you blinded his computer . His crew was misled , and he was left with no life support . You killed the man who created you - your own father ! Why ? - ' Now , listen ... ' - I know why . He was working on an improved version of you . - ' He was not ! ' - He was ! I saw it ! He was working on a new version , and you were going to be scrapped . You blinded the mother ship so that a new brain could not be made ! 'Oh ! My father was not working on a better brain ! 'There can 't be a better brain ! 'Any improvements on me , I will make myself ! ' - You 're agitated ! - ' I 'll sweep you into space ! ' You can 't kill us like you killed Captain Michael ! - I did not kill Captain Michael ! ' - You did . - ' I did not ! ' - Yes , you did ! - ' No ! ' - He told me ! - ' Who told you ? ' - Captain Michael ! Brain . Brain , I want to talk to you . - Why did you do it ? - ' It was a mistake ! ' Who am I ? 'You 're Captain Michael ! My father ! ' He conceived you ! He made you ! He 's wiser than you and greater than you ! And you killed him ! 'I didn 't ! He was about to ... ' - We 're gonna blow you into space ! - Out ! Out ! Let 's contact Tony . I 'll stop this Swift for docking procedure . Koenig to Eagle 1 . - ' Eagle 1 , receiving you . ' - ' Let me talk to Tony . ' - Yes , John ? - ' Come alongside and pick us up . ' Preparing to dock . We have to get the memory core from the brain and take it back to Alpha . The brain still has its antenna . - We 'll destroy it - cut it . - ' If you destroy it , 'my memory core will be wiped clean . Moonbase will be blind forever ! ' Is that the truth , or another lie ? 'If you don 't get me back in , I 'll wipe it . ' I 'll take that chance . Cut the antenna . 'Don 't cut my antenna ! Please , don 't cut my antenna ! ' All right , Brian . We 'll let you live if you give us your memory core undamaged . 'Take my memory ! Take everything ! 'All I ever wanted was life and friends ! 'I 'm so lonely ! 'Take it all ! Take it all ! ' He 's crying ! Reprogramming of memory core complete . - Let 's see if it works . - OK . It 's operational ! We still don 't know where we 're going . Direction check . Horizon data direction check . Operational . We 're on the same course we always were ! - Another lie from Brian the Brain . - What do you intend to do about it ? I don 't know , Maya . Let 's take a look at it . You 've made it blind and taken away its memory ... Listen , it killed a lot of people . It felt guilt about its master . It cried . It had a conscience . We could reinstall its memory core , though ... that could be dangerous . No . Not if we program our own morality into it - give it the Ten Commandments . Order it to self-destruct if it ever has any evil thoughts . Return the memory core to Swift . Yes , Commander . Hey , Maya , now that our computer has the brain 's memory , don 't become a yellow-wheeled trolley or this console will chase you . Are we going to have any off-duty time that coincides ? I think all our off-duty time has been used up for the next month . Terrific I wanted to discuss that love test . - What test was that , Commander ? - Just something that Brian devised . It 's a test that we , er ... we failed . I thought we passed it !

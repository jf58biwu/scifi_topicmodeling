 Try . Oh , it 's such a long way . - She mustn 't go back ... - Shh ! Sapphire ? It 's a warm day ! Oh , it 's a beautiful , hot summer 's day ! Mmm ! There are flowers in full bloom . There 's such a lot of flowers ! But there 's no one here any more . - They 've all had to go . - There must be someone . Someone who was close to him . Just a minute ... Yes , there is someone . Yes , there is . Come on . Come on . There ! No ! 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' 'No ! ' 'No ! ' They were looking for me ... so you 'd better help . You brought us here ! You promised ! So you 'd better help ! Who are you ? Will you tell us ? # Here we are on Tom Tiddler 's ground # Picking up gold and silver ... # Now children , back to your desks , please . That 's better . Where 's Sam Pearce ? Late again , is he ? Always late , that one , always will be . - It 's gone wrong . - What ? We want the name of a soldier , not a child . Sam Pearce , I reckon you 'd be late for your own funeral . - Get her back . - Now ? Yes , it 's gone wrong . Get her back . Will you come back to the table , please ? The circle has been broken , will you return to the table ? Will you come back to us , please ? No , no , no ! She must come to us . Come back to us - we sent her . Sapphire ? Sapphire . 'Please answer me , Sapphire . Come back to us . 'Come back to the table . ' No ! You can 't . I don 't wanna be here . I don 't know why anyone should want me here . What are you people doing ? Sitting in judgment or something ? - No . - Sitting there like that . - The state of this place . - You know this place ? I don 't know it like this . I did know it once , mind . It 's a railway station . - Oh . - Dewerton station . Oh , yes . - You recognise it ? - Well , not in this state . - But you 've been here before ? - Yes , when it was tidy , mind . - Of course . - Tully ... the name of the soldier . Will you tell us about yourself ? - There 's nothing much to tell . - Oh , there must be . Look , I-I don 't want to be here . There are things here . Things ? What kind of things ? It 's like a power ... It 's using other things . I just don 't want to be here . - It 's using you ? - No ! I don 't have a grievance . What do you mean by that ? I don 't know what I mean . It 's what I feel ... all around me . Can you ... Can you describe this power ? Not really . It 's like dark ... Darkness . It 's just ... It 's very dark . It 's darker than anything . - Anyway , I don 't wanna talk to you . - Why ? - You 're different , that 's why . - Why different ? You 're not like one of us so I don 't wanna talk to you . - I 'm only asking ... - I don 't wanna talk to you ! Not you . - Will you tell us your name ? - Why ? Because we 'd like to know it . - I 'm not telling him . - But you can tell me , can 't you ? Yes . So what is your name ? And were you at your school ? - School ? - Teaching at your school . I 'm not anywhere . I 'm here and I don 't want to be here . Tell us something about your school . It 's just a school . Please , I don 't want to be here . I 'm frightened . Tell me something about your school . It 's just a village school , that 's all . Please . Who is Sam Pearce ? Sam Pearce ... Always late for school , Sam Pearce . Always late for everything ! What happened to him ? Especially in the summer . Couldn 't keep him indoors in the summer . I said , what happened to him ? He loved the sun ... and the soil . He liked seeing things grow . Didn 't make a lot of difference really - 12 years . Well , it did when he was at school but not after . Not when he 'd grown up . 12 years - it didn 't mean a lot then . Oh , it 'll stay hot now . It usually does after a blackthorn winter . Or when there 's a frost in March , of course . Thought you 'd known that . You know up Goodman 's field ? I laid out straw there last March . Dragged it up there , spread it out . It took hours . For the lapwings , they start nesting in March , and they nest on the ground , see ? So if there 's a frost ... That one there , look . No , by there . Well , turn your head , then . That 's a pasqueflower . Well , when it was in bloom . They 're rare . Must be chalk here somewhere . Chalk pasture . Know what ? That would have been in flower at Eastertide . And we missed it . So what happened to him when he grew up ? He went away , to France . - To the war ? - Yes . I made a hide out of reeds , didn 't I ? Out on Cottal Marsh . Take you there one day . Oh , all kinds . Warblers , reed buntings , yellow wagtails . You have to be patient , mind . All right . You bring the bread and cheese , I 'll fetch the ale . Oh , no , it 'll stay hot . You know what ? Come next Eastertide , I 'll pick that pasqueflower . They 're rare . There may not be another in a season or two . Next year ... I 'll pick that next year . Well , we know who your soldier was . Yes . Then let 's get Sapphire back , shall we ? Not yet . No . - But you 've got the soldier 's name . - Yes . - Then , that 's enough . - No , it 's not enough . Eleanor . - I don 't want to talk to you . - Tell me about Pearce . - Did he die ? - Of course ! - In that war ? - Not quite . - What do you mean by that ? - I said I wouldn 't talk to you . - Eleanor ... - Please ! Don 't go near her . Any change , any sudden shock , could kill your friend Sapphire . Do you want that ? Will you risk that for information about a dead man ? All right , then , you find out what she meant . Right . Eleanor ... When did Sam Pearce die ? Tell me , please , when did he die ? It was a shame , really , he should have come home . It was summer again . 12 years ' age difference . It didn 't mean a lot , really . So when did he die ? They said in the village it was exactly 11 minutes afterwards . Someone out there had made a mistake , you see ? 11 minutes after what ? After the armistice , after the cease-fire . Someone out there had made a mistake . 11 minutes after 11 on the 11th day of the 11th month . Yes . Four elevens . All right , let 's get her back . - What 's wrong ? - They 've found me . - So what do we do ? Do we go back ? - No . It 's all right . It 's coming to help . It 's coming now . Let 's close our eyes , please . - Why ? - Because we have to . - Can I go back now ? - Yes . Just close your eyes . - Like this ? - Yes . Think about your classroom , the children . Just think of the village , the village where you live . Yes . On a hot summer day a long time ago . - Do you remember it ? - I do , yes . Can you see it ? Almost , yes . And the school , the school where you teach ? Yes , I can almost see it . Good . Keep thinking about it . Yes . Think about your classroom , the children . Oh , yes , I can ... almost see them . The sun 's shining . It 's a hot day . Open the window , somebody . That 's better . - Sapphire ? - Who 's Sapphire ? Shh . Just think of your classroom . Yes . And think of the children in the classroom . Yes , I can see them properly now . - Good . - They 're all there . All of them . All except Sam Pearce . Always late , Sam Pearce . The sun 's gone . It 's dark . Darkness . Careful at the back there . Careful . - Tully ! - Please be careful . Have you ever seen darkness like that before ? Whatever it is , it 's capable of bringing back the dead . - No , don 't . She isn 't back . - Why isn 't she back ? - I don 't know . - Sapphire ! - You can 't wake her that way . - Sapphire ! - You can 't ! - Come on , Tully . Tully ! Steel ... you broke the circle ! You broke the circle ! She could have been left out ... left outside , between journeys ! Between journeys from one life to the next ! Eleanor ? Ellen ? There was no blackthorn there . No chalk pastures . No birds . No trees . A point of subconscious had arrived between journeys ... There was no one . Don 't you see that ? ! Between the teacher 's life and her own , you must never break the circle . - Do you know what you could 've done ? - ' Steel ! ' - You could have lost her forever ! - ' Steel . ' - You could have lost her ! - Be quiet ! - ' Sapphire ? ' - ' Help me , Steel . ' 'I heard you , Sapphire , didn 't I ? - ' Answer me . ' - I was right ! You broke the circle and lost her out there ! What do you know about " out there " ? - Not a great deal ... - Exactly ! 'Steel , help me . ' - But it 's something we believe in . - " We " ? People like me . - Then don 't worry about Sapphire . - What ? She knows more than your kind will ever know . But she 's not with us , is she ? I mean , is she ? ! - Look after her for a moment . - Where are you going ? To see where that darkness has got to . - I 'll come with you . - No . No , I need you to look after Sapphire . Please ? Very well . Pearce . Sam Pearce ? Sam ... Is that what they call you ? Sorry , USED to call you . Or is it Sammy ? Well , it wouldn 't have been Samuel , would it ? Not a private soldier . I wonder what they called you when they marked your gravestone . I wonder what 's written there . Maybe they didn 't give you a stone . Maybe there wasn 't enough left of you to fill a grave . Not enough of Private Pearce left to bury . Have you been back , Sam ? Been back to take a look ? What about Eleanor ? Do you think she ever went to take a look at your gravestone ? To see what 's engraved on it ? No , doubt it . I doubt she 'd bother . She was too old for you ... and probably too good . What chance would you have stood once that summer was over ? Hey ? Help us ! Excuse me , sir . Group sent me here , sir . I 've got one more op to complete and then I go home . And he did say , sir - Group said - that as your flight is one man short and all my team have bought it , that you 'd ... All right , sir . Sorry , sir .

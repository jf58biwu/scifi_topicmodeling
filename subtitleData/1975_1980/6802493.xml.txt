 [ Motorcycle passing ] As far as I can see , these guys are completely legit , Danny . The bank has checked them out , they 're just as convinced as I am , and they 're willing to go all the way with us . You know , the idea of a franchised operation for plastic surgery resorts is a natural . It 's one of those magnificent , inevitable ideas . Banks are always quick to say that when everything 's rolling easy . But you take it from me , the first signs of heat from the Medical Association , the first cries of professional outrage , the bank will call back its note and leave us hanging by our thumbs . It 's not the financing that 's bothering you , Dan . Your voice has that edge to it . I never denied it . I just sure as hell don 't want to become the Colonel Sanders of plastic surgery . [ Chuckles ] Why not ? Sounds great to me . WOMAN : We passed it . MAN : We didn 't pass it . I remember that farm . WOMAN : We passed it . That farm is past concession road 12 . We were supposed to turn on concession road 11 . I don 't remember that farm , Dad . We didn 't pass it . I very distinctly remember that farm ! If you would just stop this vehicle long enough to look at this map , - I will show you ... - All right ! WOMAN : ... beyond a shadow of a ... MAN : You are both right , and I 'm all wrong . We 'll turn around and go all the way back . - [ Engine sputtering ] - Goddamn thing . [ Engine sputtering ] Shoulda never sold the station wagon . - Christ , Bob . - Hm ? Oh , Christ ! [ Tires screeching ] [ Engine revving ] [ Gasping ] [ Screams ] Lloyd ! Lloyd ! My God ! I just saw a motorcycle explode in that field ! [ Gasping ] My God , I think there 's someone trapped under it . I better tell the boys inside . [ Phone beeping ] MAN : Is Dr. Keloid there ? It 's urgent . Yeah , what is it , Steve ? STEVE : There 's been a motorcycle accident a few minutes down the highway . Should I take the ambulance and go get ' em ? Yeah , sure . MAN : What am I supposed to do ? Go back to three of the largest investment groups in North America and say ... - Steve ? Are you still there ? - STEVE : Yep . Well , hang on a minute . I 'm comin ' right with ya . I 'll meet you out front . Now , Dan . We have a lot of important decisions to make . Well , you and Murray work it out between you , hon . Just make the pill easy for me to swallow . Well , don 't look at me . You married him . Bob , get back ! Bob ! Be careful , Bob ! Get him back ! Hold him back there ! Get the flasher on and let 's go . [ Siren walls ] WOMAN : One of them 's under the bike . There 's another one over there . [ Whispers ] Oh , my God . - [ Siren wailing ] - How 's her bleeding ? Heavy . The man 's got a broken hand , separated shoulder , concussion . We can send him to the General . But it 's definitely major surgery for her , and right now . I know we 're not , but we 've got no choice . - How 's her blood pressure ? - Steady . I 'd say she 's got a half an hour to live , and it 's three hours to the nearest serious hospital . Look , it 's us or nobody . [ Siren wailing ] [ Indistinct chatter ] It must be bad . MAN : Come on , come on , come on ! Move ! Move ! Move it ! Oh , my God . Get it- - get it up ! Come on , move it . We don 't want to lose her . The guy in the van , he 's got a concussion , separated shoulder , broken hand . Maybe some Demerol if he becomes lucid . WOMAN : Okay , Dr. Keloid . Okay , boys . Let 's take her right into pre-op . Has Dr. Karl set her up for the works ? NURSE : We 're ready to go , Doctor . What 's that all about ? Somebody said something about an accident . You 'd think they could cover it with a sheet or something . I don 't buy it , Dan . You haven 't seen her . I don 't have to see her . Neutral field grafts have never been used internally . We could end up with a terminal cancer patient on our hands . Aw , come on . We can monitor , Roxy . She 's got nothing to lose . Literally . [ Sighs ] So , listen , when do I get to see Rose ? NURSE : Not for a while . Why not ? Oh , Jesus ! I didn 't kill her , did I ? She 's not dead . [ Sighs ] Now , I know everyone here is familiar with standard techniques of skin grafting . But what we 're going to do is a little out of the ordinary . I 'll explain as we go along . We 're removing full thickness thigh material from the patient 's thighs , as per normal graft acquisition procedure . However , before applying the grafts to the damaged areas of the patient 's breasts , abdomen , and so on , we 're going to treat them so that they become morphogenetically neutral . They will then be called neutral field grafts . [ Dermatome whirring ] Well , when the thigh skin tissue is treated , it 'll lose its specificity , as both thigh tissue and skin tissue . For example , if it were grafted to a burned cheek , it wouldn 't just be thigh skin , with the color and texture of thigh skin , it would actually develop as facial tissue . In other words , neutral field tissue has the same ability to form any part of the human body that the tissue of a human embryo has . Let me add ... that there is always a possibility that carcinomas will form when neutral field grafts are used internally . In this case , we 're using a radical plastic surgery technique to compensate for the lack of heavy medical hardware . MAN : Can we treat graft material here , Dr. Keloid ? KELOID : No , Dr. Karl , the grafts will be frozen and sent to the Sperling Institute . We 'll have to keep the patient at an operation-ready state until they come back to us . Now , I know this is going to be trying for all of us , but it can 't be helped . Her body is still in a state of total shock . We still can 't move her to a city hospital yet . But her grafts are doing well . We 've been monitoring the internal grafts electronically , and there 's a definite sign of new tissue growth happening in the abdominal cavity . Her helmet probably saved her from severe brain damage , but until she 's fully conscious ... You won 't know that either . KELOID : Well , Hart , what can I tell ya ? There is no magic . I have done my best . Now , you 're welcome to come and visit Rose any time you want . Please , believe me , I will personally telephone you the instant Rose shows the first signs of regaining consciousness . Jeez , when I saw them bringing you in , I never thought I 'd be standing here talking to you a month later . How 's your hand ? Oh , it 's okay , thanks . I think . They 're gonna take the support off later on this afternoon at the General , so that 's when I 'll find out . But the pin stays in my shoulder another month . Doesn 't seem to bother me , though , except when it gets damp . LLOYD : Yeah . Last time I got my ears done , I could really feel it when the weather changed . It 's probably something you 're just gonna have to live with . HART : Yeah , I guess so . - Hi , Lloyd . - LLOYD : Hi . - How ya doin ' ? - Oh , not too bad . Putting in for phase two , huh ? Yeah , a little eye tuck this time . - Looks terrific . - Good . Hey , let 's get out of here . I 've got a pack of hungry investors waiting for me . - We 'll see you . - Okay , bye-bye . [ Groans ] I hope you 've got somebody there to help you unload that junk . I 've got a bad back , you know ? What are you going to do with that ? Use it as an ashtray ? [ Chuckles ] [ Flicks lighter ] [ Sighs ] [ Screaming ] [ Groaning ] [ Glass breaking ] - Rosie ! - [ Gasping ] Rosie , sweetie , take it easy . You need that juice , sweetie . It 's keeping you alive . - That 's a girl . - What are- - what are you doing ? - Are we- - are we all right ? - I 'm not Hart , Rosie . Hart 's back in Montreal waiting for you . I 'm Lloyd . I 'm a friend of yours . Hart ? Hart 's back in Montreal waiting for you . Oh . I guess- - I guess I was dreaming . I don 't think you were just dreaming . You and Hart were in a really spectacular motorcycle crash . - Crash ? - LLOYD : Yes . You 're bleeding right now . I 'd better get Dr. Keloid . Oh , no , no , no , don 't go . I 'm all right , really . I 'm freezing cold ! Ooh , you 're so warm . - Hey , look , I think I 'd better- - - Oh , hold me . Please . - [ Sighs ] - Mm . I 'm dying of the cold . Oh , God , that feels so ... Uh , look , you don 't even know where you are , do you ? Oh , God . Uh , look , this is really weird . Uh , are you sure you know what you 're ... [ Groans ] Uh , I think- - I think I cut myself or something . - [ Groans ] - [ Moans ] Is that a knife or something in there with you ? - [ Groans ] - [ Moans ] [ Whimpering ] [ Knock at door ] Yes ? Who is it ? [ Screams ] God , help me ! Help me ! [ Groans ] [ Gasps ] For heaven 's sake , what happened to you ? I don 't know . I can 't remember anything . [ Panting ] Were you sleepwalking ? Did you fall against something outside and come in without waking up ? I doubt it . It never happened to me before . Get me some stuffing . One or two sponges , as well . This wound isn 't clotting at all . I think we 're going to have to give him some coagulants to get a scab to form . Right away , Doctor . Does that hurt ? I can 't feel a thing . You can 't ? My whole right side has no feeling in it . Just this aching kind of tingling . - Dr . Keloid . - Hm ? Maxim would like to see you . Well , right now ? He said it was important . He 's waiting in the hall . Okay . Listen . I think our friend here may have suffered a stroke . Now , the General 's the best place for him . But before you plug him up , I want you to draw ten ccs of blood directly from the wound for tests . Then Steve can drive him into the city in the ambulance . Make sure he takes along a lot of plasma , and forget the coagulants until the General has a chance to do an ECG on him . Will do , Doctor . Yes , Maxim , what 's up ? You told me to check around the grounds to see if I could find out how Mr. Walsh was hurt . But I could find nothing outside , no blood , nothing . Then Nurse Rita called . [ Knocks on door ] Watch what you touch , Doctor . The police may want to examine the room exactly the way we found it . Why the police ? Well , that Mr. Walsh fellow tried to molest her while she was still in a coma . I 've seen things like that happen before . Maybe he was drunk . The grafts are healing amazingly well . Judy Glasberg ? You back again ? Daddy didn 't think the new nose was different enough , so I 'm back for more alterations . I keep on saying to him it looks exactly like his , and he keeps on saying , " That 's why I want you to change it . " What 's this ? I 'm terrified to find out what it really means . [ Heavy rainfall ] [ Cow grunting ] [ Vomits ] All right , you hold it right there . Ah ! [ Chuckles ] Well , what have we got there ? Hello , sweet honey pie . What 're ya drinkin ' ? You come in to get out of the cold ? [ Chuckles ] I got something you can drink off of , and it ain 't no whisky neither . [ Chuckles ] Honey pie . [ Chuckles ] Oh , you 've got blood on your mouth . Yeah . You like me , huh ? - [ Gasps ] - I can tell you do . Huh ?

[ Shivering ] [ Gasps ] Hurry . Oh , honey It feels so good Benihana Hey , Lloyd , where you going ? You can 't leave yet . I mean , they don 't even know why you 're bleeding all over the place . Ah , it 's slowed down to a trickle . No problem . No problem , huh ? How 's the arm ? It 's fine . MAN : All right . If the night nurse comes around , I 'll- - I 'll tell her you 're in the can , eh ? How 's that ? Terrific . Take care of yourself . Yeah . You too . Take me to Camelford . I 'll tell you where to go from there . Oh ! [ Sighs ] I thought everyone was asleep . Do you mind if I get in with you ? I 've been lying in bed for so long . My body aches all over . I 'm so glad I ran into you . Uh , well , I think I 'd better be getting out , now . [ Sighs ] I 'm getting all wrinkly . Oh , no . Not yet . You haven 't even told me your name . Judy Glasberg .

She wants me to help her . She wants me to come up there right now and get her ! Look , Hart , she 's probably just frightened and confused . Did you call- - did you call Danny back at the clinic ? I got a tape recorder . [ Sighs ] I left a message . [ Sighs ] Okay . Okay , I 'll tell you what I 'll do . I 'll , uh ... I 'll call Danny on his private line right now , and I 'll tell him that Rosie 's up making phone calls in the middle of the night , okay ? Look , I 'll pick you up in about an hour , and I 'll drive you over to the clinic . - MURRAY : How 's that grab you ? - Okay , Murray . - Thanks a hell of a lot . - MURRAY : Yeah . MURRAY : You bet . See you soon . [ Click ] Does that hurt ? [ Sniffles ] No , it doesn 't hurt . How long have you been conscious , Rose ? Do you know ? A couple of days . KELOID : Do you feel weak ? I feel strong . I feel very strong . KELOID : Rita tells me you wouldn 't let her attach you to your intravenous nutrient bottles . Why ? I don 't need them . They make me feel sick . KELOID : I don 't understand . They 've got to be your only source of food . They 're not . They haven 't been for a couple of days . - Not since that man . - KELOID : Man ?

Or have him be a lawyer and defend you ? Those are your choices . Claire ? [ Gasping ] [ Sighs ] Oh . MAN ON RADIO : The man , now identified as 43-year-old Fred Atkins of Camelford , went berserk this morning during an argument over who was to be served first and bit the counter girl on the arm . The man was subdued by an unidentified truck driver and the truck stop diner 's cook , but died of unknown causes before police arrived . Local health authorities suspect that rabies might be involved and have vaccinated everyone concerned . Now , after this brief pause for station identification- - This must be the place they were talking about on the radio . Huh ? Wanna go in for a bite ? [ Chuckles ] No , no thanks . - What 's going on over there ? - Where ? The place is crawling with police . Hey , you 're right . - Oh , Christ , no . - What 's the matter ? It 's Rose . It 's gotta be . Something 's happened to Rose . Oh , Hart , take it easy . They wouldn 't have all these cars just for that . It must be something else . Okay , Murray , come on , come on . Take it easy , will ya , Hart ? [ Door ajar alarm buzzing ] [ Car door closing ] Bill ! Bill , what 's going on around here ? - And where 's Dr. Keloid ? - Murray , thank God you 're here . It 's been a nightmare . I 'm trying to find my girlfriend . Uh , she 's a patient here . She was here last night , but now nobody seems to know where she is . We 've got a young girl downstairs . You wanna take a look at her ? Is her name Rose ? We don 't know . We didn 't ask her . Come on . Uh , tell the chief I 'm downstairs gettin ' an ID . Be back in a flash . [ Siren walls outside ] So you are Dr. Keloid 's business partner ? Yeah , that 's right , I am . Now- - Come with me , please . Excuse me . - Bill ? - No , you go , Murray . I- - I can 't . I 've seen it . OFFICER : Mr. Cypher , please . Couple of my men got bitten . Those rabies shots are killers . Think I 'd rather take my chances on getting sick instead . How is he , doc ? Say , you say- - you say he got bitten . Bitten by what ? - By that . - What ? Go ahead , take a look . - Oh , God ! - [ Snarling ] OFFICER : Can you confirm the identification of this man as Dr. Daniel Keloid ? [ Snarling continues ] Come here . Can 't see anything from there . HART : Oh . - [ Sighs ] - Is that Rose ? No , no , it 's not Rose . Hey , Rose , want a bite ? Steak on a bun . It 's real good . Mm . I wouldn 't mind just one bite . You sure ? Mmm , it 's fabulous . That 's okay . It 's the last time I 'm going to eat at that greasy spoon , I 'll tell you that . That 's it , come on . Get it all out . - [ Retching ] - Okay ? All right . Just put your arm around me , and I 'll lift you up back into the cabin . We 'll get some soup or something at the next stop , all right ? Watch out . Is something wrong ? Hey , buddy . What ? Oh , I , uh ... Oh , jeez , I must have dozed off . I , uh ... I was driving . Jeez . Well , it 's good . We find too many of you guys taking pills to keep yourselves going all day and all night . - Thanks . - Next time , though , uh ... try and pick a better spot to pull over , This road 's kind of narrow . Yeah , thanks . I will . Sorry . Yeah , okay . Have a nice day . - Hi . - Hi . Where are you going ? - Montreal . Where are you going ? - Same place . Great . Whoo ! Oh ! You know , I was beginning to think I 'd never get home again . [ Police radio chatter ] Claude Lapointe , Quebec Bureau of Health , official business . - What 's up ? - Sorry , officer . You can 't go in unless you 're willing to stay . The whole station 's under quarantine . We think we 've got an epidemic . Hello , Mindy ? I want you to blow in this thing . - Yeah . How are you ? - The two of you . - The light 's gonna be red here . - Good . Listen , uh ... I thought that Rose might try and get in touch with ya . Yeah . She what ? She called you ? - Okay , blow . - She 's on her way over ? - No , I feel fine . Honest . - That 's incredible . You gotta blow in this thing . Will ya ? Ah ! That 's silly . Oh , you wouldn 't believe what 's happening here . Just blow . - Come on ! - It 's crazy time . - Yeah . - Listen , you gotta blow in it . You ain 't walking out of here till you blow in this thing . Well , listen . - When she gets there ... - All right .

That 's his truck , all right . Hey , you seen Smooth Eddy ? He 's got the lead truck , and I can 't find the son of a bitch . Think I seen him in back before . He didn 't look too good . Whaddya mean , he didn 't look too good ? Smooth Eddy always looks good . He looks sick . You know , nauseous . Aw , what the fuck are we runnin ' here , a nursery ? Eddy . Hey , Eddy , are you in there ? Goddamn truck drivers . You can 't trust ' em . - You al- - - [ Snarling ] Hey ! Hey ! [ Screams ] [ Groans ] MAN ON TV : The health officials have said they consider the outbreak of the new strain of rabies as being potentially the worst of this century . At the police station in Camelford , Kathy Draper talked to Quebec Bureau of Health official Claude Lapointe . This is not just a question of swine flu or something like that . We have already several deaths on our hands in this one small area alone , and the main problem is ... we don 't know what we 're up against . Are you saying this is not an outbreak of rabies ? I 'm not saying that . I 'm not saying that , exactly . But it must be a new strain of rabies , because there are symptoms involved which we , and even the world health community , do not seem to be familiar with . What are these symptoms ? Well , the period of incubation of this disease is very brief , maybe six , eight hours at the most . Now , that 's quick , much quicker than normal rabies . Then , the- - the victim , uh ... begins to sweat , to shake , to foam at the mouth . That 's not so rare . What is rare is that the victim always , with this new disease , uh , becomes violent and wants to bite somebody new . Uh ... and this crazy phase is followed by a coma and then , in every case we know , by death . It 's strange , very , very strange . What advice do you have for our viewers ? The disease spreads through the saliva of the victim . The saliva is very contagious . It dribbles into open wounds and cuts and- - and causes immediate infection . - So ? - So don 't let anybody bite you . And if somebody does , find a doctor who can give you rabies shots immediately . [ Knock at door ] DRAPER : I heard you mention the Black Plague of London just before we went on the air . Is that what you mean ? LAPOINTE : We sometimes like to be dramatic about these things . Surprise . I 'm amongst the living . Oh ! Come in ! Oh . LAPOINTE : And we get excited ... You got anything in there I might wanna read ? [ Sighs ] I 'm starting to go stir crazy already . Yeah , this is actually pretty exciting stuff once you know how to interpret it . Really . Whew . Ugh . I can 't see straight any more . I think I 'm going on automatic pilot . Oh , boy . I just can 't believe they 're all dead . [ Glass breaking ] George , for God 's sakes ! Can 't you understand what I 'm saying ? Stand back ! Sit on the floor and put your hands on your head . Get in the cell . Do what I tell ya . [ Groaning ] Give me room , I 'm coming in . Quick ! [ Growling ] [ Gunshots ] They gave him rabies shots . He got bitten up at that facelift place , and he was the first one to get the shots . They didn 't do him any damn good , did they ? Where are you going ? Oh , I think I have to go out for a while . Oh , Rosie , I feel so stupid . I haven 't been much of a hostess . Why- - why don 't you stay here ? There must be something in the fridge I can tempt you with . No , Mindy , thanks , but it 's not that . I just have to get out into the fresh air again . It 's a real experience for me just to walk down the street . Oh , well , then , let me come with you . No , no , no . You stay here and finish your laundry , and I won 't be gone too long . Okay , Rosie . Uh , well , if you get dizzy or anything , call me . Okay , I will , don 't worry . Yeah , bye . WOMAN IN FILM : It was beautiful . MAN IN FILM : Yes . WOMAN IN FILM : My first experience was ... like a bad trip . It was such a let-down . MAN IN FILM : That happens to a lot of young girls . WOMAN IN FILM : I take love seriously , you know .

You want me to leave ? - MAN IN FILM : No . - Well , pardon me for existing . I thought you did it on purpose . WOMAN IN FILM : Why not ? No , really . I was just taking my coat off , and it brushed against you . I 'm sorry . I really like seeing these movies , but men always bother me . Guess I 'm a little paranoid . Well , look , if I was to come over there and sit next to you , everybody will think we 're together , and you can watch it in peace . All I ask is a couple of handfuls of popcorn . WOMAN IN FILM : I 'm glad my father 's got an apartment in this building . Okay . Come on . WOMAN IN FILM : The sauna 's so relaxing . Like making love three times in a row . WOMAN IN FILM 2 : Oh , my , my . WOMAN IN FILM : You 're so predictable ! WOMAN IN FILM : My poor Christine . CHRISTINE : Oh , but such words . WOMAN IN FILM 2 : You 're afraid of words ? CHRISTINE : They 're shocking , that 's all . WOMAN IN FILM 2 : Even after the party ? - [ Christine laughs ] - Well ! See you in a minute . Be right with you .

WOMAN IN FILM : I feel as if I 've never seen it before . CHRISTINE : Well , if I decide to have my sexual relations before I marry Eric , I 'll do the same as you , Judith . It 's logical . JUDITH : We 're told to live with hypocrisy . We can 't applaud truth and not notice that we are what we are , only to despise the truth . Well , after all that , what are we looking for ? CHRISTINE : A good question . JUDITH : Happiness . Just in our own way . [ Groaning ] [ Knocks on door ] I 'm going , Rosie . I 've left you some coffee on the stove . Turn it off if you go out , okay ? [ Shivers ] Okay . Bye . Are- - aren 't you gonna wish me luck ? Are you okay ? [ Gasping ] Brushing my teeth . Uh , bye . - ROSE : Good luck . - Thanks . - MINDY : See you later ! - [ Groaning ] [ Whistle blows ] [ Snarls ] [ Screaming ] Uh , you 'll pardon me , Mr. McLaren , but I think the mayor should be taking this epidemic more seriously than he is . The city is a complex machine , Mr. Lapointe . It needs constant attention . The mayor will listen to you , but you 're not the only one . It takes time . Clark , why are we stopping ? CLARK : I am sorry , sir , but there 's no way I can get around this truck . Isn 't there anybody around ? Shall we have to turn around ? Oh , here 's somebody , sir . Clark , roll down your window and ask them why the road 's blocked . Uh , it might be strike trouble . - MCLAREN : Be careful . - CLARK : Yes , sir . LAPOINTE : They 've got the disease . Look ! Their eyes ! [ Screams ] [ Screaming ] MAN ON TV : We spoke with the director of the World Health Organization , who had just arrived from England to take charge of liaison with health bureaus in Western European countries . Dr. Gentry , do you honestly feel that this is a time for martial law ? I don 't think there is any question that martial law is needed in the city of Montreal at this point in time . It 's a necessity . It has already been established that the victims of the disease- - and it is not rabies , though it may be related to the rabies virus- - that the victims of the disease are beyond medical help , once it has established itself to the degree of inducing violent behavior . What you 're saying , then , sir , that is if these people have contracted the disease , that there isn 't ... What I am saying is very simple , and it may not be very palatable for your viewers . Shooting down the victims is as good a way of handling them as we have got . If we lock them up , they eventually go into a coma and die shortly afterwards . We have got a vaccine that we think will work in a preventative way , but for those that are already incubating the disease ... - Come on , Murray . - I 'm coming . Rose is waiting for me . Well , don 't get pushy . We 're going . Dr. Gentry , these are very serious ... - Bye-bye , Murray . - I 'll see ya . All those receiving shots of the new vaccine are being issued these plastic identity cards . Viewers are urged not to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary , and are reminded that if they do , they must carry their vaccine cards with them . Police , army , and militia officers may demand to see them . You got the keys ? Oh . Remember to keep your windows up and your doors locked once you get into the city . Maybe the bug can 't get you now , but that shot won 't protect you from the crazies . - Take care . - Thanks a lot . - All right , take care . - Okay . You got enough room . - All right there ? - Yeah . [ Engine starting ] [ Sirens wailing ] [ Sighs ] Hi . Mind if I sit down ? I don 't mind . Sure is nice , eh , Christmas ? Uh , do you smoke ? Cigarettes ? - Huh ? - Do you want a cigarette ? Oh , have you got a light ? A lighter ? Oh ! I 'll get a light from that guy over there , okay ? I 'll be right back . You got a light , buddy ? [ Growls ] [ Screams ] OFFICER : Stop ! Stop or I 'll shoot ! Stop ! Stop him . Get out of the way ! Stop ! - [ Gunfire ] - [ Groaning ] [ Screaming ] [ Groans ] [ Screaming ] Christ . Rose ? Are you home ? Well , you 'll never guess what happened to me on the subway today . Well , the whole city 's gone crazy . [ Gasping ] Aww . Have you been out ? Have you gotten your shot ? Oh ... I can 't go out . I can 't go out . [ Sobs ] - What 's been going on ? - Oh ! What 's the matter with you ? - You poor kid . - [ Sobs ] Well , don 't you worry . I 'm here , and I 'm gonna take care of you . MAN ON RADIO : And the crisis has now been officially granted epidemic status by officials of the World Health Organization . The Prime Minister was reluctant to officially declare a state of emergency , but , as any citizen in the streets can tell you , martial law has come to Montreal . [ People chattering ] [ Baby crying ] Okay , fine . I 'm sorry you don 't have an ... Where 's your ID card ? Uh , would you mind standing over in front , please ? - Can I get through ? - Thanks . ... an emergency and you 've got to attend , or ... Right at the back . It 's only three minutes . It 'll be all over before you know it . Get the shot , okay ? Thank you very much . - At the back . - WOMAN : Thank you . Sorry . You don 't have an ID card , you can 't go through there . Would you mind standing over that way , please ? Uh , get that guy . I 'm sorry , sir , you can 't get through . I 'm sorry , sir ... Leave him alone . Don 't push him . - You don 't have a card . Now ... - You 've got no right to do that . Uh ... How long are we gonna be stuck here ? I can 't believe this . It 's like we 're at war . Listen , Hart . I want to go to my place first . I just won 't be comfortable till I know everything is okay back there . Now , when we get there , I 'll give you the keys to the car , and you can pick up your girl , okay ? Yeah , okay . [ Siren walls ] Listen , uh , phone me when you get there , eh ? Yeah , okay . Hey . Look , uh , maybe it would be a good idea if you- - if you bring Rosie back with you . You know , just till this thing blows over . Yeah , okay . - Listen , Murray . - Yeah ? Thanks for the car , all right ? Keep the windows shut and lock the door . - All right . - I 'll see you soon . I 'll call ya . 'Cile ? Hey , Cecile , I 'm home . Honey ? Sweetie , I 'm home . [ Sighs ] Hey , Cecile ? Hey , sweetie . Honey ? 'Cile ? Sweetie ? Sweetie , I 'm home . [ Rattling sounds ] 'Cile ? Honey ? [ Gasps ] Oh , God . [ Sobs ] Oh ... [ Woman whimpering ] [ Screeches ] Get off me ! That 's it , Rosie . You just get as much sleep as you need . Don 't think about anything . Just let your mind drift . GENTRY ON TV : So after using some rather elaborate tracking procedures , and applying them to a map , we find that the disease does in fact seem to have a very specific place of origin . INTERVIEWER : Which is ? GENTRY : Which is ... the Keloid Clinic of Cosmetic Surgery , a few miles outside the town of Camelford . You can see with your own eyes how everything has spread out from there in geometrically increasing proportions . Now , this pattern , in conjunction with some of our own statistics , indicates that there is a strong possibility there is a special factor at work in the spread of the disease . INTERVIEWER : You mean a carrier ? GENTRY : Well , at the risk of setting off a futile witch hunt , yes . Someone like the infamous Typhoid Mary , who incubates the disease and transmits it , but is herself immune to it . INTERVIEWER : Well , what were they doing at the Keloid Clinic , then , Dr. Gentry ? [ Tires screech ] [ Snarling ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Groans ] [ Gunshot ] Okay , Jack , that 's another . Oh , no ! Rose ! Well , you- - you can 't ! It 's dangerous out there ! Mindy , I don 't want it to be you . Well , of- - of course it should be me . But- - who else but your best friend ? I 'll take care of you . Oh , I ache all over . I hurt from the inside out . Well- - well , then- - then , what you need is- - is a nice , hot bath . It 'll relax you and- - and then you won 't ache anymore . Mm . [ Sirens wailing ] [ Gasps ] It 's not my fault . It 's you . It 's been you all along . What are you talking about ? You carry the plague . You 've killed hundreds of people ! You don 't know what you 're talking about ! I 'm still me . I 'm still Rose . You 're still Rose ? You 're not Rose ! What did they do to ya at that clinic , eh ? Ah ! - What did they turn you into ? - [ Whimpering ] I have to have blood . It 's all I can eat . And it 's not my fault . [ Screaming ] It 's your fault ! It 's all your fault ! Rose , stop ! [ Screams ] God ! [ Screams ] Oh , Rose ... [ Sobs ] Rose , there must be a way to fix this . Look , we 'll go to the police . No . Rose . We 'll go to the hospital . Oh , it won 't work . Now , just leave me alone ! - Rose ! Come here . - No ! - I 'm sorry ! Come here , wait ! - Let me go ! - Rose ! - Let me go ! No , no ! Listen , Rose . Listen . Listen . Listen to me . - Listen to me , you 're right . - No . You 're right . We 're in it together . - We 'll figure it out together . - Ah ! - [ Groans ] - [ Screams ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Metallic clang ] [ Sighs ] [ Panting ] [ Sighs ] [ Siren walls ] Oh ... Hi . I 've seen you around here before , haven 't I ? Um , I used to live in this building , and , uh , they still deliver my mail here . I 'm a- - a friend of Mindy Kent 's . I was supposed to meet her here , but , um , she must have gone out . [ Telephone rings ] [ Groans ] [ Sighs ] [ Groans ] [ Sighs ] [ Ringing continues ] [ Sighs ] [ Panting ] - Hello ? - ROSE : Hart . It 's me . Oh , I 'm so glad I finally managed to get you . Rose , where are ya ? Are you all right ? Did I hurt you ? Listen , we should be together . Please , tell me where you are . Well , what you said hurt me . It scared me . It- - it scared me because I- - I suddenly realized you might be right . If you are right about my being a carrier , I mean , uh ... I murdered Mindy . I murdered a lot of people . Rose . There 's no reason- - So I decided to try a little experiment , just to prove that you were wrong about all that . You see ? I 'm being positive , aren 't I ? So I found myself a partner for my little experiment , a real normal , healthy guy , and I took some blood , just a bit . And I 've locked myself in a room with him . And I 'm gonna stay here until I make sure he doesn 't get sick . And then I 'll know ... I 'm not the one who started it all . Rose , look . You gotta get out of there . Right away . You 're committing suicide . You know that ? Listen , can 't we just be together over the phone ? I mean , just for a little while . Just- - just until I find out . I mean , we can be together on the phone just for a while , can 't we ? [ Sobs ] [ Sighs ] Oh , Hart . Please . Listen . Please , no . Rose , get out of there ! Look , just get up and drop the phone and walk out the door and run out of there as fast as you can . You 're not giving us enough time . You 're not giving either of us- - Oh , Hart . No , don 't . - Listen . I can 't . Hart . - Rose ... [ Sobbing ] Hart ... [ Sobbing ] Rose ! - Hart ? - Rose , get out of there ! - I 'm afraid ! - Get out of there ! Hart ... [ Screams ] No ! No ! No ! [ Screams ] No ! [ Sobbing ] No , no ! No ! No ! [ Siren wailing ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots continue ] [ Growling ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] [ Sirens continue ]

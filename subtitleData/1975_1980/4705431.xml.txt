 You did well . - The owner didn 't think so . - Did you kill him ? . - Were we supposed to ? . - It 's tidier . It 's easy to be tidy from where you sit , Largo . Don 't get clever , dream head . That wasn 't the deal . The deal was whatever I say it was . I own you , dream heads . Unhuhhhh . What do you say ? . Please , Largo . Please , Largo . Pure Shadow ... You won 't just die without it ; you 'll die in terrified agony . Please . Good . All right . I want your brother to ask for it . One word from me , and your supply is gone , forever . - You 've been paid . - Prove it . I thought that honour was a big thing with the Terra Nostra . We own you , boy . Please , Largo . Please . That 's better . We owned you from your first tiny drop of Shadow . Use Shadow ? . Do I look that stupid ? . Oh , try it ! Hanna . - The other two he promised ... - Enough ! The gems ... Nobody steals from the Terra Nostra . - We 're innovators . - You 're dead . Out , Hanna . Casual , don 't run . Face down , Largo . Quickly . Quickly ! Now close your eyes . Now stay like that . Go ahead and try it . Killing a Terra Nostra pusher will be the best fun I 've had all day . You stupid murdering scum ball . They 'll catch us . Get Peety and meet me at launch grid six in twenty minutes . Nobody gets away from them . We will . Look , I can get a ship . Launch clearance , what about launch clearance ? . The crew on grid six are for sale . It 's too late for that . Listen . Hanna , she told me to look after you and Peety . That 's what I 'm trying to do . Grid six , twenty minutes . Right ? . - Right ? . - Right ... Approach completed . All vectors are matched and holding . Power down , now . Switching to automatics . Confirmed . All systems functioning . Status is firm . Very pretty . I know . Piloting wasn 't bad either . So , that is Space City . Also known as The Satellite of Sin . - By whom ? . - Me . It had to be someone of limited imagination . Pick a pleasure , any pleasure . And you 'll find it for sale in Space City . - If you 've got the money . - But we have , we have . And if you can stomach doing business with the Terra Nostra . We 're going to use them , Gan , not do business with them . A subtle distinction that escapes me for the moment . Now don 't tell me you have a moral objection to using their organisation to infiltrate Earth ? . Of course not . Well , I have . Think , Gan , think what they 've got : men , material , information . Think what we could do with a fraction of the resources they control . No , YOU think , Blake . Think what it is they control . Everything dirty , degrading , and cruel on just about every colonised world . Earth is all I 'm interested in . The Terra Nostra aren 't responsible for everything , Gan . I could go and murder somebody now and it wouldn 't be their fault . Mind you , if I picked his pocket afterwards they 'd want their cut . It 's largely academic anyway . I don 't think we 'll get within shouting distance of them . The Terra Nostra run Space City . How can you be sure of that ? . You say they 're a criminal organisation who work in secret . They work in secret on Earth and the Federated worlds . Organising crime . Space City itself is neutral territory . Not officially owned by the Terra Nostra but it 's an open secret . A neutral base for an outlawed organisation ? . - Well , presumably it has its uses . - Entertainment , for example . Why don 't you take a cold shower or something ? . And risk being left behind when we go and meet your friend ? . Largo 's no friend of mine . When I met him on Callisto he forgot to mention he was a member of the organisation . Just said he wanted me to run a cargo into Earth . He didn 't tell me what it was at first . - Drugs ? . - Shadow . I turned him down . Very sensible . Possession carries a mandatory death sentence . That wasn 't the reason . Navigation computers are receiving interrogation signal from Space City trafficapproach control . It 's about time . Request standoff position . Cally , stand by on the teleport . Jenna , get on the communicator and see if you can contact your friend Largo . Gan , Avon , get ready as well . - Vector coordinates received and laid in . - Execute . - Er , what about me ? . - You ' re staying here . - What ? . - Where I can find you if I need you . - But that 's Space City , one of my all-time great ambitions . - You 'd probably be disappointed . - I 'll take that chance . - I would never forgive myself , Vila . Hanna ! Twenty minutes I said . That launch crew goes off shift in an hour . We may not get another chance . Where is Peety ? . How ? . How ? ! . That 's how ! He didn 't take any more . He didn 't need another dose for twelve hours , at least twelve hours . He just , just died . Just died ? . That 's what Shadow does . It kills you ! Think I don 't know that ? . Then why ? . Why so stupid , Hanna ? . Stupid . Stupid Peety . " Look after you " ... Not your fault . - Largo ... - Bek ? . - It won ' t help Peety . - It 'll help me . - What about me ? . - You ? . It 's too late , remember . You 're already dead , like Peety . Must run in the family . Shed the gun . Largo wants you two , very badly . - Blake 's wrong . - I know how you feel , Vila . I don 't mean about leaving me behind . I 've wanted to visit Space City ever since I was old enough to read the graffiti in the Juvenile Detention Wards . But I 'm not talking about that , I don 't care about that . - No , of course not . - I don 't ! Am I arguing ? . I 'm talking about his great plan to enlist the help of the Terra Nostra . He plans to buy their help . All right , " buy " their help . It still won 't work . You should have spoken before . Who listens to me , ever ? . Does anyone ever listen to me ? . I 'm telling you , it 'll be a disaster . - Relax . - You don 't know them . I know Blake . Thinks of himself as a hard man . Hard ? . He 's strictly a fluffy-cheeked amateur compared to those boys . I think Blake can look after himself . - He 's led a very sheltered life . - What , Blake has led a sheltered life ? . Look , he was an Alpha grade on Earth . A highly privileged group , the Alphas . Wouldn 't last five minutes among the Delta service grades where I grew up . And it 's the service grades where the Terra Nostra really operates . Without anaesthetic , usually . - No , Vila . - No what ? . - No , I 'm not going to operate the teleport for you . - I don 't understand . I do . You 're about to suggest it would be a sensible idea , if you went across and gave the others the benefit of your experience . I hadn 't thought of that . What a very good idea , Cally . - No . - Cally ? . I 'm going to get myself something to drink . Call me if anything happens . Miserable alien . I just want to see what it 's like . Information . Main visual is available . - So ? . - You expressed a desire to see what it is like . Very funny , Zen . Chuckle chuckle . If you were a decent computer you 'd be able to operate the teleport system like Orac can . Like Orac can ! Key , key ... Ah , key ! Orac ? . Orac ? . Are you in there , Orac ? . Am I in where ? . What precisely do you imagine I am ? . Some sort of tame rodent in a cage ? . That 's precisely what I imagine you are . A rat in a box . I see no point in continuing this conversation . Now , don 't start sulking again , or I shall switch you off and throw away the key . - Soon , that will be no longer a problem . - Eh ? . - Well ? What do you want ? - Orac , I 've got a little job for you . I don 't think that at this stage you really need to know specificdetails of our plans , do you ? As you say . In effect , we want to buy cooperation and expertise from the Earth-based network . Why are you telling me all this ? . We don 't know who rules the Terra Nostra . Possibly you don 't either . But you do know how to get our proposition to them . A go-between . Naturally , we would be prepared to pay for your services . Forgive me , Blake , but one of the reasons I made my home in a free city like this is because I adore eccentrics . Do we take it that you 're not interested ? . Oh , I 'm fascinated . But I 'm just an independent businessman . Are you sure ? . Look , the Terra Nostra doesn 't exist . Believe me , it 's a phantom , a ... - A shadow ? . - A myth , a legend . It 's a legend a lot of people believe in . And yet you know it doesn 't exist ? . Why are you so certain ? . I 've got a contact in Federation Security . If the syndicate existed , then he 'd know about it , wouldn 't he ? . This contact , he wouldn 't be the one who arrested me after I refused your cargo , would he ? . Oh , that was a mistake , Jenna . I was doing a favour for a friend . If I 'd known what the cargo was I wouldn 't have touched it myself . You didn 't answer the question . - Why do I feel as if I 'm on trial here , hmm ? . - Why do I feel as if you should be ? . They 're beautiful stones . I 'm a bit of a collector , in a modest way . I could make you an offer . - They have a sentimental value for me . - Oh , family heirlooms , eh ? . No , I 'm just sentimental about money . We 're wasting our time with him . Yes , I think so . Shall we go ? . I 'm sorry we couldn 't do business . - Let me at least offer you some refreshment . - We didn 't come for refreshment , Largo . Oh , but I insist . He insists . Maybe we should have listened to Gan . Looks as though he was right after all . Communicators please . And those . Thank you . Amateur ! A pro keeps it simple . Vila ? . Vila ? . Zen , where is he ? . I left him on watch . He is no longer on the ship . But he must be . He teleported into the city with the assistance of the one called Orac . I forgot about Orac . The one called Oracis not concerned for the safety of the Liberator . Well where is Orac then ? . He 's not in the teleport section ; I just came from there . In return for the remote activation of the teleport system , Vila conveyed the one called Oracto another part of the Liberator . Which part , where ? . - Be silent . - Orac ? . Zen ? . Zen ! Vila , this is Cally . Come in please . Vila ! What do you want , Cally ? I want you back here . Get ready to teleport . Wasting your time , Cally . I 'm not wearing a bracelet . I 'm not going to be snatched away in the middle of , in the middle of anything . Sightseeing . And you should see some of the sights I 'm seeing . No . Perhaps you shouldn 't . - Where is Orac ? . - I promised not to tell . - I never break a promise . - Oh yes , you do . Almost never . Orac 's all right . He can ' t run away . Oh , you fool , Vila . Stop worrying , Cally . I 'll be back soon . Tell you what ; I 'll bring you back a present . What would you like , Cally ? Name it and it 's yours . A necklace , Vila , made from your teeth . - No . - Orac ? . I will destroy the life support systems ifyou attempt to find me . Why are you doing this ? . I don 't think even Vila could open that . I wonder what they 'll do ? . " A pro keeps it simple " . I imagine they 'll kill us . You can 't get much simpler than that . - Sorry , Avon . - That makes all the difference . I don 't know how they spotted me . " I don 't know how they spotted me . " Something amuses you ? . You were using him as a lookout ? . I mean , he 'd really blend into the background , wouldn 't he ? . What did you do , put up a sign ? . Is that what you did or is Largo keeping you here as a favour ? . - We made a fool of him . - Obviously . That 's why we haven 't been killed yet . He 's making an example of us . Oh , shut up Hanna . It 's none of their business . Isn 't it ? . I mean if they 're making an example of you ... It 's not for outsiders . You don 't know much about the Terra Nostra , do you ? . - Do you ? . - Leave her alone We are an object lesson for their own people . Largo 's on his way up in the organisation . One sign of weakness and he 'll be on his way down again , probably minus his head . Now there 's a happy thought . It 's a pity we won 't live to see it . - We 're not dead yet . - Largo hasn 't got what he wants yet . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Liberator , this is Blake . Come in please . Blake , this is Cally . We have a problem . Later , Cally , this is more important . We 've made a deal but we need the rest of the money as a demonstration of good faith . They don 't entirely trust us yet . Have ... Zen collect it and bring it across . - All the money ? . - Yes , Cally , all of it . - Ah , it 's a trick . Kill him . - Wait a minute . Why do you think it 's a trick ? . You think I 'm a fool . Zen can 't leave your ship . Your shuttlecraft is here in the city . We carry more than one shuttle . - How many ? . - Four . Four . Cally , this is Largo . - Yes . - Shall we send your shuttle back or one of ours ? . - Neither . It is not necessary . - Why not ? . - We have another shuttle . - Another shuttle ? . Quite a ship . How many do you carry ? . He 's testing me . Probably too far away . Blake , Blake , I shall count . When I reach the right number , call my name . One . Two . Three . Four . Cally , are you still there ? . Sorry , what did you ask ? . - I was just wondering how many shuttles you carry . - Four . Does it matter ? - We 'll be expecting your man , Zen . - Right . And he won 't be expecting us . We shan 't be needing his other two friends after all . Kill ' em . - What about her ? . - We 'll keep her till we 're sure . Orac , I need Zen . I will ask no questions . Zen ? . Put the battle computers online . Put up the force wall , activate the radiation flare shield , and clear the neutron blasters for firing . Completed . Neutron blasters are cleared for firing . Open up a voice channel to the city 's central control . Confirmed . Central control . Go ahead . This is the weaponry officer on the battle cruiser Liberator . Your computer took a priority channel . Whatever you want had better be important . Four of my friends are being held prisoner in your city . Unless you release them immediately I shall open fire on you . Listen , lady . You shouldn 't drink in those cheap dives . You go blind eventually . - Zen , report battle computer status to central control . - Confirmed . All right . So you 're at battle stations . You don 't expect us to believe that you 'd .. A man called Largo is holding my friends . You have six minutes to release them . You can 't be serious ? I was never more so . You have five minutes and fifty-five seconds . - Detectors report high-speed approach . - Scan . - Gun ship . It is manoeuvring for attack position . - Warn them off . - Warning ignored . - Compute coordinates , range blasters . - Blasters ranged . - Warn them again . - Warning ignored . They are pressing their attack . - I gave them a chance . Hold your fire ! . Central , the next shot will be right down your throats . You have three minutes and thirty seconds . - You two , out . - Why ? . You 'd prefer not to know . Your professional simplicity is beginning to irritate me . Well think of it as a temporary problem . Move . Simple enough for you ? . Don 't stand around . There 's more where he came from . - Your sense of timing is as impeccable as ever . - I have always admired your patience . - Are you all right Jenna ? . - What does it look like ? . Leave it ! Largo . - Central . You 're holding prisoners . Release them . - What ? . There 's a lunatic woman threatening to destroy the city . Get those people back to their ship . - Must I ? . - Do it , Largo . I think we 've outstayed our welcome . All right , Cally . We 're ready to come across . - We 'll come with you . - I 'm sorry . Sorry ? . Polite , but inadequate . We can 't stay here , so you 're not going without us . - I think they went without us . - There 's gratitude for you . Gratitude ? . You point a gun at them and expect gratitude ? . Maybe we could use him as a hostage ? . Him ? . After his foul-up you won 't get a drink of water in exchange for him . - I changed my mind . - Why ? . - Do we care ? . - Put these on . - What 's in it for you ? . - You can help me with one of my crew . His name 's Vila and he 's suffering from a bad attack of alcoholic remorse . All right , Cally . He wants to make a necklace of his teeth . No effect on the flight systems ? . Everything seems normal enough . Maybe she imagined it . - That 's not like Cally . - Not like Orac either . - Any luck ? . - Can 't find Orac . Even tried calling his name . Oh , I 'm sorry I missed that . It 's the kind of natural stupidity no amount of training could ever hope to match . You found Orac ? . No , but then I never really expected to . It is one of Vila 's more elaborate practical jokes . Talking of Vila , how long before he comes round ? . Oh , several hours . And he won 't feel much like laughing when he does . Oh , I 'll guarantee that . All right , we 've wasted enough time on it . Let 's get back to the Terra Nostra . Back ? . We only just managed to get away from them . We chose the wrong approach , that 's all . Is that all ? . I thought maybe we 'd chosen the wrong people to get involved with . - WE chose the wrong approach ? . - I chose the wrong approach . Does it matter ? . - Yes , it does . - All right , Avon . You were right and I was wrong You said persuasion wouldn 't work and it didn 't . So now we use force . Force ? . Yes , of course . Lawmakers , lawbreakers , let 's fight them all . Why not ? . The Terra Nostra 's wealth comes from organising and controlling all sorts of crime . But their biggest profits and a lot of their control comes from one area . Shadow . That is the only one that matters . That is what we attack . And how do you propose to go about it ? . Where would we get the information we would need ? . Bek , would you ask your sister to join us , please ? . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Blake ? - Yes , Cally . - Has anyone found Orac yet ? . - No , I think we 'll have to wait for Vila . - There may not be time for that . - Has something else happened ? - No , not exactly . - Well what exactly ? - A feeling I have . - Come back to the flight deck . - I should keep on searching . - Leave it , Cally . Yes . Orac ? . I warned you not to look for me . I know where to look for them , chairman . Only your stupidity makes it necessary to look for them . I had to ensure that they took my agent with them . When she is reporting on their movements I 'll follow them and capture them . So . Chairman , the rewards will be threefold . The money they are carrying , which is substantial ; the bounty from the authorities , which is also substantial , and more importantly , the demonstration that we can punish where the Federation itself can 't even reach . Very well , Largo , a heavy cruiser will be at your disposal , but don 't delay too long or the rewards will be one-fold : the demonstration that we can punish . I thank you for your confidence , Chairman . Largo , that is too small a thing to thank me for . - You 'll pay for that ... - Before or after he finds out that you are lying ? . Was I lying ? . It would make me very unhappy to think that you tried to use me , like some fool . You 're just an enforcer . Here for your gun , not your brain . Of course I was lying . Except about the girl . - She 's not your agent . - Ohh , but she is ... That dream head is going to tell us exactly where Blake and his friends decide to go . - Don 't worry . - It 's all I have You 'll get it back . Zen . Analyse . I want the derivation . The main constituent is an organiccompound , probably derived from the zerophyte of the genus Korda . - A cactus . - Confirmed . The species is alpha seven oblique five . Known as the Moon Disc ; it was greatly prized for its partial telepathy and its ability to move short distances to avoid direct sunlight . - It stayed in the shadows . - That 's where the name comes from . Commercial collectors rendered the Moon Discextinct on its native planet . - Which planet , Zen ? . - Zondar . And when it proved impossible to grow in any other environment the total extinction of the species followed logically . - Only it didn ' t . - There are traces of an element ... All right , Zen , we 've got enough . Have the navigation computers set in a course for the planet Zondar . - Confirmed . - Wait . It has to be the source , the key to all the Terra Nostra 's power . - If we control that , we control them . - Right . The drug in return for their help ? . Blake that would make us pushers . - Maybe we won 't keep our end of the bargain . - And that would make us cheats . That will make us winners , Gan . That 's the only excuse for fighting . It 's too good a chance to miss , Gan . I 'd like to see that , to see them grovel . When the Federation introduced the death penalty for possession , the President described Shadow as the greatest single threat to the welfare of mankind . - Don 't tell me you agree with Gan . - No , no , no , I 'm just ... interested . It seems to me that we have identified the source of that threat rather easily . - So why haven 't they ? . - Exactly . - Maybe we 're about to find out . - Maybe we already know . Never again . I 'm dying . Cally . Cally , what 's the matter ? . Cally ? . Cally ? . It 's only me . What 's the matter with her ? . [ DISTANT SCREAMING ] Obviously , she 's insane . - How is she ? . - The same . I left the girl with her . - Have you run the diagnostic checks again ? . - Still nothing . There 's no physical explanation for her condition unless somehow it 's locked up in here and I don 't see how that can be . - She is an alien . - She is more human than I am . - That 's not difficult . - Have you remembered anything yet ? . It 's a complete blank . From the time you left to meet Largo to when I woke up back on the ship . With what you drank you 're lucky to remember who you are . - I would hardly call that lucky . - This is NOT helping Cally . - Orac 's told you what happened . - Nothing , according to him . - I don 't believe it . - Computers do not lie . - Orac is not a computer . - That was its creator 's vanity . Orac is a computer . It is a highly sophisticated tool , and that is all . Well , something frightened Cally . Yes , and so badly she may never come back from wherever she 's hiding . - It was not Orac . - Maybe it wasn 't anything , anything real . Information . Flight time remaining is now forty-eight minutes . Visual and detector readouts are now available . Let 's see it , Zen . It 's a pretty colour . - Oh , considering what it is . - Let 's hope they don 't know we 're coming . There 's no reason why they should . They 'll be making planetfall anytime now . Excellent . Are all Largo 's addicts so available ? . Yes , Chairman . It seems he 's been adding it to all the Shadow that we 've supplied . - Radioactive , you say ? . - Not exactly . Controlled particle emission . Detectable only with the right equipment , which Largo 's got , of course . - Surely it damages the addicts ? . - Kills them a little sooner But at least if you need one you always know where to look . What a clever idea . We must consider it for general use . What about Blake and his friends , Chairman ? . - You can leave all that to me . - Yes , Chairman . You 've done well . Dispose of the body . His assets are now yours . Thank you , Chairman . Cally 's still the same . Hanna 's singing to her now . - What ? . - I don 't think she 's going to come out of it , Blake . - She will . - I don 't think you care whether she does or doesn 't . One thing at a time , Jenna ! I 've been thinking . If it 's that hot down there , why don 't you try landing on the night side ? . Why don 't you try listening ? . The system has twin suns ; there is no night side ! I wish you wouldn 't shout . Gan , have you got everything clear ? . - Yes . - Well ? . - Zen 's doing the flying , I 'm just monitoring it . - Monitoring what ? . Maintaining a powered orbit on the edge of the atmosphere . - Why ? . - For maximum cover . From defences that should be there but aren 't . Are you ready to go ? . There 's nothing you can do for Cally . Shouting at everybody else is not going to help her . A powered orbit can be tricky , Gan . You need to stay alert . All system are functioning normally . Status is firm . Good , then let 's go . Jenna , Vila . Teleport . I don 't know why they 're all so jumpy . Show me the planet . Visual . I mean , look at it . It 's nothing . Why should anyone draw attention to it with heavy defences ? . They don 't expect it to be found . Down and safe . Stay by the teleport , Vila . Cover me . - It 's enough to fry your eyeballs . - Daintily put . It must be the company I keep . Zen 's right . It looks to be about half a mile away . - That 's far enough to walk in this heat . - Far enough to crawl . There 's no cover . Blake , over here . Look . Moon Discs . [ FAINT CHITTERING ] - Prized by collectors . - People collect odd things . Look what you ended up with . You process those ; you 'll get a liquid that 'll kill you . Only if you 're stupid enough to use it . Listen . No , not over there . It 's coming from them . It 's a sort of whispering . They 're supposed to be telepathic . - They 're supposed to move . - So are we . Come on . - It could have been frying eyeballs you heard . - Daintily put . [ FAINT CHITTERING ] - Vila ! Get back to the teleport . - Five minutes . I must get something for my head . - You can 't leave the teleport now . - Five minutes . - Don 't be stupid . - My head is killing me . - And you may be killing Blake and the others . - All right . Orac , operate the teleport as instructed . Satisfied ? . - Not really . - I 'll only be five minutes . - Orac , did you understand the instruction ? . - It was quite explicit . Child of Auron . Listen to the voice of Orac . Remember the touch of hands and laughter and the warmth of open minds . Remember these things for they are gone . You are alone . No . You are alone . You are the last of the humankind . Orac ; don 't . I am the darkness . Oracbrings my darkness . You are alone , in me . Run , last of the humans . Run , before my darkness engulfs you . Run , run , run ... Cally ? . [ TELEPORT WHINE ] They probably collect them in deep desert and bring them here to boost their growth . With surface water in the area there will be a whole network of these gardens . - I almost feel sorry for them . - They 're plants . - These are singing . - You should have stayed in the cool . The collection and processing plant should be somewhere over there . - Seems logical . - Yes , well don 't get too close . All we 've got to do is plant these sensors in some form of rough circle . The battle computers will put together a complete picture of what 's there . And then the ship 's main blasters will pick off anything we care to nominate . Yes . Back in an hour . [ FAINT CHITTERING ] No , she didn 't hit me , she ran straight over me . I was just in the way . I never saw anyone so scared . - You couldn 't tell why ? . - You couldn 't see what was driving her ? . I don 't think I 'd want to . You can 't share someone 's madness . They can on Auron . Cally told me her people can share any experience . And telepathy means they never have to be alone . Makes them very strong . When they 're together . What happens when one 's isolated ? . I think that 's what we 're finding out . I 'm going back to the teleport . All right Orac , you can go back to sleep . Agh ! That key 's electrified ! Did you do that purposely ? . - You will not disconnect . - Is that right ? . Ow ! That hurts ! The bridge is almost complete . You will not disconnect . [ GUNFIRE ] Next , please . This is silly . It 's just a machine . Of course it is . If it wasn 't so expensive , I 'd kick it to pieces . - Yes , if it didn 't bite . - Avon 'll fix it when he gets back . Yes . - The bridge is complete . - What ? . What did he say ? . - Something 's wrong . - No , that wasn 't it . - Information . Liberator is losing power from all systems . Orbital maintenance is threatened . - Switch off all auxiliary systems . - Power drain is increasing . Orbit is decaying . - What 's happening ? . - Switch to main boosters . Zen ! Automaticflight control is now aborted . The manual controls won 't respond ! Do something , Gan ! Something is draining off the power . - Orac , it has to be Orac . - Disconnect him , Vila Do it ! We 're heading toward the atmosphere . We 'll burn up , explode ! Here , let me . Hanna ! She 's dead . That thing killed her . Don 't do it . It 'll kill you too ! We 're falling towards the atmosphere ! Hello . - You cannot stop me , child of Auron . - Then why do you threaten me ? Oracis my bridge . You stand before it , puny telepath . Yes , I know you now . My powers are in your dimension , and Orac 's carrier waves are your bridge . The energy is building . I am ready to cross . Hungry dark to absorb the blazing suns . - I will deny you . - You are alone . No . The warmth you mock me with is here . I am not alone . You will stay in your universe of darkness . You will not disconnect . You will not disc ... We 're getting power . The power 's coming back . Orac . The key 's gone . - There 's two more over there . - Vila , bring us up now . Liberator , come in Liberator . - Cally , what 're you doing down there ? - Waiting to come up , again . So it was an alien life form that killed her ? . Yes . It was trying to use Orac as a bridge to cross from its own universe into ours . That 's why it needed so much power . But a quantum jump would need much more energy potential than Liberator could develop . The explosion in the planet 's atmosphere would have provided the rest . Yes , I hadn 't thought of that . So you see , Bek , this thing tapped into Orac 's channels , sucked up all his energy , so that it could come squirting out and swallow us all . The plain man 's guide to alien invasions . But , where did Cally fit in ? . Why did it attack you , Cally ? . I was a threat to it . I knew it was there because of my telepathy . Orac uses special communication waves , which pass into another dimension . And it is the same dimension that allows thought transference . - Orac 's telepathic ? . - No , telepathy is conscious . Orac has no consciousness in that dimension . He merely ... drives a beam though it . Which is why he could be controlled by this force . And why you couldn 't , you fought it telepathically . Yes . Once the Moon Discs had broken through my isolation ; as soon as I was no longer all alone , I could fight it . But what about the key ? . How did you get Orac 's key while he was up here and you were down there ? . Long arms ? . - Telekinesis . - Who ? . The power to move objects by thought alone . That seems unlikely . Yes , it does . Even among my people such power is rare . Maybe the Moon Discs . Their telepathy gave me courage . Perhaps it gave me strength , too . So . Either we all become telepathic , or we dump Orac . - Destroy rather than dump , surely ? . - I 'll do it . - It isn 't necessary . - Will it work ? . Of course it will work . I have set a small disruption bomb to precise limits within Orac 's energy range . Any variation above or below and there will be a rather satisfying little explosion . Any attempt to tamper with the communication channels will reduce Orac to a heap of spare parts . So Hanna died for nothing . Just her . Even that machine survives . - I 'm sorry , Bek . - She was dying anyway . Oh , I know that . Just another dream head . What about the low-life scum that really killed her ? . What about the Terra Nostra ? . That is who we 're waiting for now . We 're what ? . Why ? . We want them to realise that we know who they are . This is the ID of a guard I killed . He was a member of Federation security , a very special member . He was one of the President 's personal security force . The President of the Federation runs the Shadow operation . And since Shadow is the basis of the Terra Nostra ... - I don 't believe it . - It 's quite logical . To have total control , you must control totally . Both sides of the law . The Terra Nostra , the Federation : two sides of the same power . The same men of power . Ironic , isn 't it ? . We were hoping to use the Terra Nostra to attack the Federation , only to discover that it is already being used to support it . - Where are all the good guys ? . - You could be looking at them . What a very depressing thought . Whose is this ? . - Mine . - Is it alive ? . - Yes . - I thought they died if they left the planet . No , you have to talk to them . That 's like talking to Vila , a complete waste of time . When we 've finished here , we 'll get you back to Space City . What for ? . There 's nothing left there . It 's your territory . At least you know who you 're fighting now . What have I got left to fight for ? . I 'll give you three years , then I 'll come looking . I expect you to be able to help me . Information . Detectors report seven Federation pursuit ships approaching in attack formation . Seven ? . One for each of us . How very generous of the President . Blasters cleared for firing , sensors functioning , planetary targets identified and ranged . Wait a minute , Avon . Bek , that button burns the President 's garden . It won 't hurt him much , but it 'll sting a bit . Stand by to take us out , Jenna , when it 's done .

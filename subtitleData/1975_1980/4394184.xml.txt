 Get the child . Quickly ! - Come on , Helen . - But Sapphire 's upstairs . Come on ! - Get her away from me . - It 's cold ! Come on ! Someone was killed in this room - a young girl . It wants me to be her ! It wants it to happen again . Steel , don 't ! The girl 's killers are here ! They 've broken down the door ! Steel ! - Sapphire ! - It 's gone , the room 's gone ! But they haven 't ! 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' Steel ! What 's wrong with Steel ? He reduced his temperature to minus 273.1 degrees . That 's near absolute zero ! Yes . He told me not to touch him . Rob , go to the kitchen and light a fire , please . Yes . Sapphire , look . Yes . Go on . - And Rob ... - Yes ? - Make it a good fire . - Yes . Not ... enough ... It was . You held that one . E - Enough to hold them , not enough to st-stop them . - M-Mustn 't regain its heat . - I know . Must be kept at same temperature . Yes . Helen , will you help us ? You take Steel down to the kitchen . But don 't touch him ! Upstairs and downstairs , upstairs and downstairs ... Is he any better ? Not yet but he will be . 'Fire . ' 'What ? ' 'Has the fire gone out ? ' - ' No , it 's still burning . ' - ' Higher . ' It takes all his strength away . Yes , it does . - Sapphire ? - Yes ? It 's only us , then , if that thing comes back . We 'll be all right . 'The frozen piece of light . ' - ' I 've dealt with it . ' - ' You followed my instructions ? ' - ' Yes . ' - ' Good . ' 'Now go to sleep , get some rest . ' - Rob ? - Yes ? - Are you feeling fit and strong ? - Yes . - Good , I need a hand . - Oh . - You 're not gonna scratch that ? - What ? - The glass , that was my dad 's table . - Emergency measures . - When my parents come back ... - It 'll be all right . - Things will take longer to thaw . - Look , Rob . Steel said this was a fragment . It is . Will you help me with this ? A fragment of what 's in the top room ? Yes . - Oh . Is it is alive ? - Yes . - Is it hurt ? - Who cares ? - Remember it tried to kill Sapphire . - Yes . It 's more of a scion than a fragment . - A scion ? - Yes , a descendant . A successor . A child . Is it something you 've seen before ? Not quite . It 's like it but it 's different . - As dangerous as before ? - More . - And there 's two more in the house . - Yes . Well , I must go and see to Steel . Will you two bring that down to the cellar , please ? Yes . Pick it up . - It 's too heavy , Rob ! - Come on , Helen . Oh , Rob ! Wait a minute . Why can 't Steel freeze whatever 's upstairs in the attic the way he froze those soldiers ? That would only suspend it for a while . Not even Steel can stop time for always . It 'd be like trying to freeze the whole universe into one block of ice . Are there others ? - Others ? - Like you . There are 127 of us . Oh . Come on , Helen . 115 . There are 115 of us . You must never rely on the transuranics . - Why not ? - They 're unstable . - Wait for me , Rob ! - Come on , Helen ! - But if it 's a child ... - Who said it 's a child ? - Sapphire did . - She didn 't say " child " . She didn 't mean it . She said " descendant " and then " child " . Like puppies or kittens . Its young . - What ? - At school they say " its young " . Yes , but this is different . Different from anything we 've known and the things they know at school . You saw what that thing did . Are puppies capable of that ? - No . - Well , then . But what if its parents come looking for it ? - Steel could handle it . - But he 's not well . Yes , but when he 's well , he 'll just take himself down . - Who is it , Rob ? ! - I don 't know , do I ? Perhaps it 's the policeman . I 'll see . - No Helen ! - But we 've got to answer it , Rob ! All right . A giant ? - Yes ! - No , a man , but almost a giant . - In the doorway ? - Yes ! He knocked on the door ! - Then what ? - Then he pushed it open ! - He came from outside ? - Yes ! - A soldier ? - No , he was in ordinary clothes . - It 's a giant ! - It 's all right . Did he come in ? - I don 't know . We ran . - Leaving the door open ? He pushed it open ! - We 've got to wake Steel . - No . For the moment ... I 'm afraid there 's just the three of us . - It 's closed again . - Yes . Now , be very quiet and do exactly as I say , do you understand ? - You left it open ? - Yes . - It 's closed . - Look ! Hello , Sapphire . Got anything to eat in this place ? It 's him ! It 's the giant ! You could call him that . This is Lead . - Lead ? - Yes , he 's one of ours . You know what ? I 'm starving . All right , where is he ? Where is Steel ? Lead ? Is that Lead here ? Yes , I 'm here . You can almost guarantee it , can 't you ? You can guarantee that whenever you wander off and ice yourself up without me around , you 're in trouble . - I am not in trouble . - All right . You 're not in trouble and you don 't need any help . No . But you do need ... Insulation . And that 's me . You tell him , Sapphire . He shouldn 't be doing that below-zero stuff without me . Now ... What about some food ? Sapphire ... Are you still the cook I remember ? Ahh ... By the way , Steel ... Jet sends her love . Does she , now ? And Copper 's having problems with Silver . - Again ? - Again . When you 've finished eating , I 'll show you what we have to do . All right , Steel . - Always cool , that man . - He has to be in this house . - Difficult job ? - Yes . Be good training for you , then . There 's another difficult one waiting for us . When we 've finished here , of course . Ahh ! - Steel ! - Up here ! Thank you . Here , son . He gives you all the tough jobs , eh ? - No ... - He 's good at that . - Having trouble ? - Yes . Are there many more ? Yes . Rob will help when he 's done the pictures . Good . It started in there . First a section of the wall , then the wall , now the whole room . Oh , there 's nothing like good home cookin ' ! It 's using old verse and picture forms . Sorry , Steel . The main trigger ? Children 's nursery rhymes . Upstairs and downstairs ... - Has it taken anyone ? - Yes . The boy 's parents . It 's all right , son , he 'll get them back for you somehow . Lovely . These are easy , aren 't they ? Yes . Oh ! OK . Can I have another one ? Oh . I 'm going in there and I 'm gonna freeze it back as far as the wall . - You 're gonna walk in there ? - Yes . Into that ? You know what that does to you . But you 'll be there to help me . My insulation , remember ? And I also remember that it knocks the hell out of me too and if it goes wrong we are both trapped in there . We 're gonna try it ! As soon as the books and pictures have been burned . It can 't be worse than that ship . - Don 't count on it . - You were on that ship ? - I did a day on it . - What was the name of it ? - What was it , Steel ? - I forget . - Blue ... - I thought it was Marie . Marie ... Marie Blue ... Marie Blue Blue Blue ... - Not the Marie Celeste ? ! - That 's the one ! That 's it , that 's it ! Upstairs and downstairs ... - The Marie Celeste was important ! - Was it ? People have been trying to solve it for years ! Have they . Are there any more books ? This one ... Sapphire ! Helen ... 'The north wind doth blow and we shall have snow ... ' - I know that one , Sapphire . - No , Helen ! - I do . - It wants you to know it ! It 's in my head , Sapphire . It 's in my head . Helen , help me catch it . It couldn 't have been the Marie Celeste . It was . It was found abandoned and Steel sank it . I sank the real one , yes . What is it , Steel ? 'The north wind doth blow and we shall have snow 'and what will Poor Robin do then ? ' ... and hide his head under his wing ... ' ... doth blow and we shall have snow 'and what will Poor Robin do then ? ' Helen , stop it ! - I can 't ! I can 't ! I know it ! - No ! I do ! It 's in my head and it won 't go ! 'The north wind doth blow ... ' ' ... shall have snow ... 'and what will Poor Robin do then ? ' 'Upstairs and downstairs ... ' 'He 'll sit in a barn - ' and keep himself warm ... ' - Rob ! 'Upstairs and downstairs ... ' ' ... and hide ... ' - Let me out , Rob ! - ' Upstairs and downstairs ... ' Rob ! Wait for me , Rob ! 'Upstairs and downstairs , upstairs and downstairs , 'upstairs and downstairs , upstairs and downstairs ... ' Rob ! Let me out , please , Rob ! - ' Upstairs and ... ' - Wait for me , Rob ! - Don 't listen to it ! - It 's ... coming ... through ... 'Upstairs and downstairs , upstairs ... ' Downstairs . No ! 'Upstairs and downstairs , upstairs and downstairs , 'upstairs and downstairs , upstairs and downstairs ... ' 'Upstairs and downstairs , upstairs and downstairs ... ' 'The north wind doth blow and we shall have snow 'And what will Poor Robin do then , poor thing ? 'He 'll sit in a barn and keep himself warm 'And hide his head under his wing , poor thing 'Poor thing ... '

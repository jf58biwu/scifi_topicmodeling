 'Starbuck crash-landed . A planet on the edge of Omega Sector . ' - At least we don 't rust . - Silence . - Kyle ? - My brother . He 's our leader . He 's only a boy and the others were just children . We trade Starbuck to the tin cans for Father . And I just wanted to thank you . We don 't have your father yet but ... you 're welcome . 'There are those who believe 'that life here 'began out there , 'far across the universe , 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans . 'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens . ' Boomer , I just reached a big decision . - You should be the first to know . - Only the two of us out here . See that red star 40 degrees to port ? I gotcha . What 's the big decision ? I was just staring at it and the words of my old flight instructor came back to me . " Starbuck , a viper pilot only flies three vipers ... " the one he trains in , the one he escapes from ... " and the one he dies in . " Starbuck , the scanner . - ' They 're on our tail ! ' - Let 's show ' em our nose . - They 're running . - ' Yeah , not for long . ' 'One in your blind spot ! ' - Starbuck , you OK ? - I 'll tell you if you tell me how bad it is . And give it to me straight . No lies . It 's all hanging out to dry . I don 't know how you can transmit . Everything back of your anti-burn baffles is gone . Everything forward isn 't exactly tiptop . I 'm trying to find you a place to land . All I can do is fly straight ahead . And I 'm not too sure about that . 'Afraid my instructor was right . ' 'Get going before you run out of fuel . ' - ' Get going . ' - Not till I know you 're down . If I don 't make it , you 'll be the first to know , I promise . I 'll be back with a clean uniform before you know it . I 'll be seeing you . I hope . When you 're finished , move the petro dump inside the moat , under the protection of our outer walls . By your command . Canus Patrol has intercepted two Colonial viper craft . Colonial vipers . Well , well . One viper running . The second is crippled and has penetrated the atmosphere . We are tracking him . Order our patrol to return . - ' Canus flight leader , return to base . ' - Returning . What if the Colonial warrior evades our patrol ? Impossible . Aah . Attila garrison commander reporting . - Attila ? - An obscure outpost in the Omega Sector . The commander 's name is Specter , I believe . One of the earlier IL series . Before my time . Rather limited in ability . Report , Specter . 'We have apprehended a Colonial warrior . ' Excellent . Have you interrogated the pilot ? 'The scouting party that captured him has not yet returned to our garrison . ' I think you know what I desire . 'The exact position of the Galactica . ' I shall await your next communication . You have a wonderful opportunity here , Specter . - Use it well . - By your command . This Specter seems to have done rather well ... - for an early model . - Hmm ... Aaah ! Hey ! Aaah . Take it easy , would you ? These humanoids are not well constructed . They damage easily . - At least we don 't rust . - Silence . Aaah . Welcome to Attila , Lieutenant . - You can 't come in here . - It 's important . Stop whispering . I 'm not asleep . Now you 've done it . Good to see you looking better , sir . I don 't look better . I look awful . - But I feel better . - But you won 't for long if you don 't get some sleep . With that doorway guarded like the gateway to Kobol , I presume something important has happened . The recon patrol ? As you felt , the Cylons have penetrated more deeply than we expected . Our patrol was ambushed . - And ? - Starbuck had to crash-land . - But he did land ? - Yes . - Where ? - Attila . It 's a planet on the far edge of Omega Sector . Bad news all around . Recommendation ? Sending a squadron would draw too much attention . - What , then ? A shuttle ? - In and out fast . It better be fast . If it 's not back within 24 centares it 'll never catch up with us . - You and Boomer ? - Yes , sir . Please , please , try ... try not to move . You have been hurt . - There were others . - My brothers and sister . - And Cylons . - Don 't worry . We can handle them . Kyle is very , very smart . - Kyle ? - My brother . He 's our leader . Leader ? But he 's only a boy and the others were just children . We are not children . We are warriors . Miri , prepare some food . - The others will soon return from patrol . - Patrol ? Those boys and that little girl out there with Cylons ? - Do you realise what can happen ? - They saw their mother killed , watched the tin cans pillage and invade our castle , slaughter our people . What can happen to them ? They could be killed or captured . We are too swift , our attacks too precise , too well timed , too well planned . - You attack them ? - They are the enemy . They took all we ever had . So now we hurt them . We attack their ammunition depots , fuel dumps and patrols . Yeah . Thanks for that . We fight a common foe . You 're from the Galactica , correct ? You know of the Galactica ? We learned of the Galactica from the Cylons . How far away is she ? - Too far . It 'll be a while before a rescue party can get here for me . I 'm afraid you 're stuck with me for a bit . Tin cans are following the tracks I laid ! Corporal , is this the way you report ? A buncha tin cans , sir , following the tracks I ... you ordered me to make in Naga Forest . Very good . At ease . Now , get some nourishment . We 're a little short on discipline at times but you won 't find better warriors . Who taught you ? Your father ? - Father was our leader until ... - Until the Cylons killed him ! Miri , feed the lieutenant . And be quick . We have a mission . Robus , Nilz , Ariadne , go get your tablets . Oh , Miri . We want to talk to the warrior . After you eat and study . That smells good . I didn 't realise I was so hungry . - You 're also their teacher ? - Their education is very important . I always wanted to meet a woman as long on brains as beauty . You think I 'm pretty ? Oh , Miri ... Eat ! Miri , when you get back to the Galactica , you 'll have every viper pilot battling over you . - You 'll drive them crazy . - Back to the Galactica ? Yes . You can 't stay here . When the rescue team from the fleet comes for me you 'll come with us . All of us ? Of course , all of you . We have a mission . Boxey . Oh , it 's good to see you . How did you get past the guard ? - I snuck right by her . - You snuck right by her ? You 're the first . You 'd better get under the blankets just in case she decides to sneak in , too . I 've got somebody to talk to . Shall I tell you a story , like you do when I 'm in sickbed ? Oh , that would be nice . There once was a shiny planet ... Called Earth . No , called Mushieland . Mushieland ? And it was full of daggits - orange daggits , blue daggits , daggits with horns , daggits with curly tails . The best daggit of them all was Sire Muffy . Sire Muffy ... By your command . The first patrol was eradicated . No . And the Colonial warrior ? Gone . We found signs of humanoid renegades . Our patrol is tracking them . My commander sent me to report . I hope your commander is more efficient than his predecessor . Oh , no . They will never learn . Did you drop my message for the tin cans to find ? What 's wrong ? - Kyle , we can 't do this . - It 's the only way to get Father back . - But Kyle ... - You want Father back , don 't you ? - Of course I do . - Then there 's nothing to discuss . We trade Starbuck to the tin cans for Father ... tonight . Why do you bother , Specter ? I 'll die long before you get anything out of me . I 've come to tell you that you will be freed , tonight . Freed ? Oh , Lord , no . What does he think he 's doing ? The only intelligent thing he can do . Do you think me a fool , Specter ? Don 't you think I know you 'll never go through with this trade ? What you believe is irrelevant . However , I will go through with it . - Provided you cooperate . - And if I don 't ? I vow to slaughter your entire family at the exchange site . - Kyle is much too clever for that . - Is he ? He 's the one who proposed the trade . Your son is getting desperate . Why do you tell me all this ? If you 're gonna do it , just do it . I want your word that once reunited with your family , - you will stop these senseless attacks . - You 'd take my word ? I have come to learn that the word of some humanoids can be more binding than Cylon chain . You are such a man . - And the Colonial warrior ? - Not your concern . Do I have your word ? - Excellent . Make the signal . - By your command . I will see that you have clean garments . I would not wish your children distressed by your appearance . Well , you 're looking fit , Lieutenant . Whatever Miri put on my leg , it 's working . Thanks , Miri . Feel up to riding ? Er , yeah , if needed . I heard explosions . Are they tracking you ? Not quite . The Cylons only track us when we want them to . We are moving to a new camp . What was that ? The worship bell in our castle . Kyle , please ! Are you telling them where we are ? Just answering a challenge . We shall be moving anyway . - What if there are Cylon patrols nearby ? - Do not tell me how to command . Well , someone better ! This is no time for heroics . You think because you wear a uniform and fly in a fighter , you should be in charge . Is that it ? Are you afraid I 'm trying to take over ? - I fear no such thing . - Kyle ? Kyle , is what he says true ? Ah , so ... he smiles and you choose him . - Him over Father . - Father ? Your father 's dead . Ah . No , he 's captured . Kyle , it won 't work . The Cylons will never make a trade . - You are very bright , Lieutenant . - Hm . I regret doing this but it 's the only chance our father has . He is as good as dead and so are you if you meet with the Cylons ! - Bind him . - Kyle , I don 't think ... That 's an order ! Bind him . Starbuck ... I 'm sorry . Still no word from Attila ? Specter will contact us if he has anything to report . Perhaps he feels his report will not be received satisfactorily , Baltar . What are you implying , Lucifer ? I have discovered that Specter has ordered more laser pumps and petro than any other garrison . So he 's stockpiling . What commander doesn 't ? He has also ordered an extraordinary supply of laser rifles and metron bombs , certainly unnecessary requisitions for a planet whose entire population has supposedly been terminated . Lucifer , do you wish me to believe that Specter would submit false reports ? Speaking from experience , I would not say it is beyond his programming . Lucifer , I do believe you 're jealous ! Such a reaction is not programmed into IL series circuitry . Commander , Specter reporting . Ah , Specter . You have the coordinates of the Galactica ? 'Uh ... - ' no . ' - Hmm . 'The Colonial warrior was injured in the crash . 'We are attempting to repair his body 'in order to extract the information you need . ' I see . How long do you estimate this to take ? 'Oh ... 'Within five or six centares , he should have sufficiently recovered to torture . ' I 'm counting on you , Specter . 'I know . 'And may I say it is a distinct honour to serve the illustrious Baltar ? - ' You are a legend to us ... ' - Oh , feldercarb . Well ... thank you . 'By your command . ' You see ? A logical explanation . Yes ... You work on this while we move it . I 'll work on this . You need not worry about an infection . It looks much better . Terrific , I can walk to my execution . Oh , please don 't , Starbuck . - Perhaps they won 't ... - Kill me ? Miri , you saw what the Cylons did here . They haven 't executed Father . They 're probably trying to find your location through him . Or wait for just what happened - a trade . We will continue to attack them . Perhaps we can get you back , too . How ? Trade another human for me ? Huh ? No thanks , Miri . I couldn 't live with that . The raft is ready . It 'll soon be time . Do you really expect the Cylons to make this trade ? I certainly do . I planned it rather well . The tin cans will put Father on a boat and launch him towards us . We will simultaneously launch you towards them . You see , neither side can take advantage of the other . - Wanna bet ? - Kyle , perhaps we are making a mistake . It is a necessary tactical move . We are talking about a human being , of trading him . For our father ! Look , Miri , I know what I 'm doing . Have I not led well since Father 's capture ? Yes , but we are not an army . We are a family . Look at them . Go on , look , Kyle . - They 're just children . - Yes , children who need their father . Kyle , I agree with you but this isn 't the way . Megan . You keep your end of the bargain . Kyle . - Miri ! - It 's Father . - Children ! - Father ! Kyle , it 's Father ! Kyle , please , just listen to me for a centon , will you ? I 'm sorry , Lieutenant , but I have no choice . That 's the signal . Make the exchange . - Miri , it 's Father ! - Where ? - Over there . - I can 't see him but he 's near . - Which way is he coming ? - Do you see him ? We 've kept our bargain . Where is the Colonial warrior ? Launch the raft . - It 's Father . - Father ! Father , look at us . Oh , Kyle ... Starbuck was right . Those little sclime . They deceived me ! Well done , my children ! Well done ! Annihilate them ! Stay down . - What will happen to Father ? - They 'll kill him , won 't they ? No . They kept him alive to stop the raids . This won 't change a thing . - Are you sure , Starbuck ? - Of course I 'm sure . - Miri , take the kids . - OK . Go . Starbuck , I almost made a grave tactical error . I 'm relinquishing my command , to you . - I accept , on one condition . - Name it . That you continue as my lieutenant . With pleasure . What are your orders ? Well , the first ... the first thing is to get out of here . - And the second ? - To free your father . Let 's go . Anything ? Scanner 's clean . We 've been lucky so far . How long until we orbit Attila ? Two centares , give or take a centon . We 'll make a low-level approach from the backside . Then I 'll turn it over to you . You know where Starbuck went down . It 's a big planet , Apollo . Boomer ... I know where he went down . Looks impenetrable . Our fortress held out the longest when the tin cans invaded . But there were too many . Father and I fought a rearguard action while my brothers and sisters escaped . How 'd you get out ? Through the secret passage . Uh ... Secret passage ? I know what you 're thinking but it won 't work . I tried sneaking in that way once , but they 'd made the main hall into a command post . There are always two or three score in there . We 'd stand no chance . What 's that between the castle wall and the moat ? That 's the petro dump . They moved it closer because of our raids . Lieutenant , I got an idea . Come on . My old flight instructor told me the easiest way to remember a sequence is to sing it . So , one more time . Through the tunnel , under the land Starbuck and Miri creep hand in hand We swim the moat to the petro dump and blow it up with a great big whump At the bridge the youngest daughter drops tin cans into the water And around the castle the son first-born Rides at a gallop and blows his horn ... 'The first to go is Starbuck and Miri carrying torches to keep things cheery' 'Then the brothers swim through the water 'To set their bombs for a Cylon slaughter 'Ariadne is ready to throw captured grenades at the bridge below 'We go up the steps to the castle floor 'And sneak a peek through the secret door 'Although the dump is double-guarded 'We 'll sneak across while the guards are parted 'Robus sets one bomb and then the other 'Leaving the rest to his older brother 'When all is ready across the moat Kyle will sound the signal note I apologise for the delay . The captured warrior is still unconscious . - He may even terminate . - Die ? 'Unfortunately , we are programmed to destroy humans , not save them . 'Our knowledge of their anatomy is so limited . 'Still , I do not offer excuses 'despite my securing this planet for the Empire in record time . 'If this warrior terminates , 'I can only view my mission here as a failure . 'I will have failed one of the great leaders of our millennium - you , Baltar . ' Oh , feldercarb . Now , now , don 't be too hard on yourself , Specter . 'My reports tell me you 've done a brilliant job on Attila . ' - Well , we have had our problems . - Problems ? This planet is so wet , half our garrison is down with rust . 'But I will spare no effort in saving the human 'and extracting the information you need . 'By your command . ' You actually believe that daggit drivel ? Lucifer , this jealousy is simply not like you . Specter is doing a wonderful job . Ah , no , not again . - Petro dump is exploding . - I know the petro dump is exploding ! - Dispatch a phalanx of centurions . - By your command . First phalanx , follow me . 'At the bridge the youngest daughter drops tin cans into the water . ' The phalanx on the bridge . I see , I see ! Centurions ! Stop those ... those despicable renegades . I sure hope this works . I think what you 're doing is wonderful . And I just wanted to thank you . Well , we don 't have your father yet but ... you 're welcome . 'Through all the confusion , noise and bother 'Starbuck and Miri rescue Father . ' - Which tower ? - That one . Yes , my children ! My warriors , well done ! Well done ! Megan ! Get down ! Father . Oh , Father ! I hate to break up a family reunion but let 's go . Looks like an entire sector is under attack . Cylons must be taking over . Set her down close . Maybe we can help survivors . I just hope Starbuck 's not in that inferno . The renegades are within the walls . - Inside the garrison ? - Unfortunately . What else can go wrong ? 'Any progress ? ' Er ... I regret to report the Colonial warrior has ... terminated . 'What was that ? ' Er ... We are destroying the last humanoid habitats to assure that no one will ever find refuge on this miserable planet again . 'Excellent idea . Scorched planet policy . - ' You 're a wonder , Specter . ' - Thank you . I have many such ideas and since this environment is so detrimental to our circuits , perhaps you would find use for me and my Centurions elsewhere . 'If it 's that destructive to your circuits then , naturally , abandon it . 'Report with your unit when you have destroyed the human abodes . ' By your command . Yes , I think we are through here . Order all Centurions to the launch field . - Father ! - My warriors . Nilz . They 're gone ! Running , all of them ! Lieutenant Kyle reporting that tin cans are fleeing to their transport ship . - The area is secure , sir . - Well done , Lieutenant . Father . You 've done so well . I 'm very proud of you . - Thank you , sir . - You 're a good leader . What hit this place ? An army ? - Apollo . - Boomer ! - Starbuck ! - It 's about time you guys showed up . - Got the clean uniform ? - What ? Clean ? What happened here ? Oh , er , not much . My warriors just wiped out a Cylon garrison . They 're children . No , no . They 're warriors . - Just make it fast , OK ? - OK . Well done , warriors . Couple more yahren and you 'll be giving your big sister competition . You can still come with us . We 've fought long and hard for this day . Our ancestors originally migrated here from the Colonies but this is our home now . If the Cylons return , we 'll be ready . I don 't doubt it for a centon . You earned this , Lieutenant . - Congratulations . - Thank you , sir . It 's been a pleasure serving you . Ah , yes . Miri . You could 've broken half the hearts on the Galactica . Including mine . I ... I don 't know how he does it . Neither do I. Starbuck ... We have to go . Starbuck ...

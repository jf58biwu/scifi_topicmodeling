 All right , Zen . Run it again for me , will you ? . Confirmed . Play back , normal speed . [ PLASMA DISCHARGE ] [ ELECTROSTATIC HUM ] Orac , why won 't you give us the background to that prediction ? . Because that would invalidate the prediction . And if we knew the future in detail we could change it , and so it wouldn 't be the future . Correct . That is the paradox ofprediction . All right , Zen , standby to run it again , at half speed . Confirmed . Slow or fast , it will still look the same . - How long have you been there ? . - I was here when you came in . Why didn 't you speak ? . I had nothing in particular to say . Besides , you looked as though you were planning something you didn 't want the rest of us to know about . Orac 's prediction still hasn 't come into effect . I am trying to find some reason why he was wrong . - Have you found what you want ? . - No . That 's because you 're looking for the wrong things . What exactly does that mean ? . It 's a common enough failing . Now if you 've finished with Zen , I 'd quite like to get on ; we have a malfunction on the intermediate range sensors . I need to check the systems . Leave it ! If I 've missed something , I want to know what it is now , Avon . Well now , all you had to do was ask . Zen ! Replay , half speed . Confirmed . Stop . All right , reverse to the instant before the explosion . Freeze it there . All the reassurance you could want . Do you think you could forget your superiority complex for a moment and get on with it ? . All right . But first of all , let us examine the nature of prediction . The human mind is capable of seeing into the short-range future with reasonable accuracy . For example , imagine that you are standing on the edge of a cliff . As long as you 're not standing behind me . There are a number of alternative futures . You could take a pace forward and plunge to your death . The cliff could crumble under your feet with the same result . A gust of wind could carry you over . All right , yes . But the probability is that I would turn and walk away . Exactly . You 've just made a prediction based on the known facts . A computer works on precisely the same principle . But all you 're saying is that prediction is not immutable fact . Right . If you hadn 't gone near the cliff in the first place , you wouldn 't have faced any of the dangers . So ? . Zen , selective magnification . Show us the background . Confirmed . Look at it , Blake . Look at the configuration of the stars . That position is unique in the universe . Ah ! Of course . Zen can give us a precise astral fix and tell us exactly where the event is supposed to have happened . Congratulations . All right , where is it ? . It 's in the Twelfth Sector . Astro point seven eight one . What ? . But that 's halfway across the galaxy ! Now if we make sure that we never go into that area , then the prediction becomes void . I 'll tell the others . Uh , how long have you known ? . Oh , several hours . And you just let the others go on worrying ? . Well , all they had to do was ask . Perhaps in future , they won 't rely on you to provide all the answers . [ DULL EXPLOSIONS ] - What the hell is going on ? . - Zen , report . Aft hull sensors register two strikes by medium-range neutron blasters . Where are they coming from ? . Due to the malfunction of our intermediate range detectors , that information is not available . [ EXPLOSIONS ] Zen , activate the force wall , increase speed to Standard by 8 . Battle computers on-line . Confirmed . Avon , get the others in here fast . Zen , direct vision , 360 orbital scan . Confirmed . Attention ! We are under attack . Battle stations ! Hold it there . Two ships homing in on us . Concentrate force wall on coordinates five five three one . Confirmed . Five five three one . Vila , activate the weaponry system . Jenna , take her on manual . [ DULL EXPLOSIONS ] - Re-energise the force wall . - Confirmed . - What are they , Blake ? . - I don 't know . Blake , look . - Battle computers propose evasive course . - Specify . Planetary orbit at two thousand spacials . - Closer . Make it one thousand . - Confirmed . Cally , give me tracking on the hostiles . Maximum magnification . They must be Federation ships . First analysis indicates that they are not vehicles of a type used in Federation fleets . Who are they ? . That information is not available . Entering planetary orbit now . Hold it there . - Closing in on us . - Jenna , hold course till they 're within our range . - Holding course . - Weapons systems primed for firing . - Lock on target . - Target fixed . Range ? . Fifty thousand spacials and closing fast . They 're travelling at almost Standard by Twelve ! - Impossible . - I tell you , they are . They 'll be in range in fifty-one seconds . - Hold course . - Holding . - I 've got their communications frequency . - Voice contact ? . - No , just computer talk . - Can our machines translate ? . - Negative . - Zen , identify the hostiles . - Forty-two seconds . - Zen ! The information must be bypassing the translator systems . Thirty-five seconds . Let me launch a couple of seekers before they fire . It might throw their attack run . - Go ahead . - Firing one and two , now . Come on , come on . They won 't fire ! The fail-safes keep cutting in . - Override them ! - Twenty seconds . The whole system is locked into negative . Blake , without firepower we 'll be blasted to pieces . Hostiles closing fast . Thirteen seconds to blaster range . Avon , stand by the force wall . - In range . - Force wall . Primary malfunction . Force wall won 't activate . Leave it . Hit it , Jenna , all the power we 've got . Hang on ! [ NEUTRON BLASTER FIRE ] [ NEUTRON BLASTER FIRE ] Gan ! Cally ! Vila ! It 's all right , Vila . I think we 've lost them . - How d 'you know ? . - We 're still here ... Cut the auxiliaries . Get back to primary drive . Are you all right ? . All I am willing to admit is that I am still alive . We 've got to know if those ships are still coming . See if you can get a scan . Cally , take her down to her quarters . Gan , go and check the power units , will you ? . Right . Blake , I can 't cut the auxiliary drive . We 're still running on full power . - The scan is out , we 're flying blind . - What 's it register , Vila ? . Maximum . Can we hold together at that speed ? . - We won 't have to . - What do you mean ? . Running at full power will drain the energy banks in , what ? . - Two hours at the most . - And then we 'll have no power at all . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Blake . - Gan . I 'm in Sub control One There 's a lot of damage here . Virtually all the control systems seem to be out . - Check the other sub control rooms . - Right . Where did those ships come from ? . Who were they ? . Yes , and why did they attack ? . Zen was confident they weren 't Federation . - So why did they pick on me ? . - I doubt if it was personal , Vila . It felt personal . It always feels personal when someone tries to kill me . It seems we were pretty lucky . Those ships came up on us when we were blind . They should have been able to wipe us out completely . Zen , I want a full damage report ... and then an assessment of how much the breakdown can be handled by auto-repair . The translator unit must be out . Then we 'll have to do it all ourselves . Vila , go down and see if you can help Gan , make a list of all the faults you can find . I 'm going to isolate the auxiliaries from the energy units before they burn up all our power . Avon , concentrate on Zen . Give priority to the detectors and the navigation systems . And then see if you can get us some scans . - Is that all ? . What shall I do with the other hand ? . - I 'll let you know . When you get Zen working , ask him to prescribe something for a headache , will you ? . I 've got this shocking pain right behind the eyes . Have you considered amputation ? . - How 's Jenna ? . - Just shaken . She 'll be back in the teleport as soon as she 's recovered . Good . Help Avon with Zen . What can I do ? . Strip down the auto-navigator , remove the damaged components , and list them for replacement . This is going to take time . It could have been worse . - It should have been worse . - What do you mean ? . Something Blake said . Those ships should have knocked us out completely . Why didn 't they ? . - There could be many reasons . - I have considered all of them . - Only one is satisfactory . - And which is that ? . - They didn 't want to destroy us . - But it was a full-scale attack . Was it ? . Their first attack knocked out our weaponry system . The second run knocked out virtually every instrument system . Right now Liberator is out of control . At least , out of OUR control . You think all this was intentional , and we 're not running on a random course ? . Oh , I think we 're going somewhere quite particular . [ ALERT CHIME ] [ DATATRANSFER ] Acknowledged . The pursuit craft have made contact , and have initiated all programmed functions . Assemble the assault group and prepare for transference . Acknowledged . [ DATATRANSFER ] [ AUXILIARIES POWERING DOWN ] [ EXPLOSION ] [ AUXILIARIES POWERING UP ] [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Blake . - The lights are pulsating . What 's happening ? . Nothing . Just get on with what you 're doing . Switching the drives in and out isn 't helping , you know . I 'll call you IF I need you . [ ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE ] How are you getting on ? . I 've finished fitting the auto-navigator . And now there is just this detector unit that is burnt out . You 'll find a replacement in the auto-repair cavity . Good . That 's all completed . That 's strange . Thought so . Zen is functioning , the computers are working , but not for us . Avon , there 's something wrong in the teleport section , all the controls are activating . Are you sure ? . The locators are setting bearings . Come and see . No one is to go near that section until we have Zen under control . - Why ? . - I think I know what 's happening now . The teleport section will be the most dangerous area on the ship . When it happens , THAT is where it will start . When what happens ? . What are you talking about ? . If I 'm right , this will show it . It 's rejecting the replacement ! It 's more fundamental than that . We are the cause . It is rejecting US . - Jenna . - Jenna , it 's Blake . I 'm in Sub control Room Four . Get Avon down here fast . - Avon . - I heard . I 'm busy . He 's working on Zen . I don 't care what he 's working on , get him down here ! Blake , what I 'm doing is vitally concerned with our survival . Are you prepared to take responsibility for what happens if I delay ? . - Don 't I always ? . Now just get down here ! - Anything you say . And Avon , don 't come crashing in ; gently as you open the door . Blake 's regard for our safety is inspiring , don 't you think ? . Avon , there 's no structural damage in the other control unit . Well , that 's something . But the instrument and systems disruption 's enormous . I shall tell our fearless leader . - What 's the matter with him ? . - What do you think ? . If it ever comes to a showdown , my money 's on Blake . Well , half of it . I 'll put the other half on Avon . That 's a safe bet . But if Avon is right , we 'll probably all be dead anyway . Dead ? . Is that your idea of a safe bet ? . Easy ! Easy . This coil 's live in every sense . It 's got enough energy to vaporise both of us . All right , you 're giving the orders , what do you want me to do about it ? . Turn off the power , without touching the main switch . What happened ? . I tried to shut off the auxiliaries . But they switched back on automatically . That 's happening to every function onboard . And then this coil leapt at me as though it was trying to protect the switchbox . The ship is working against us . From now on we are just passengers . The question is , where to ? . I 'm going to try and break the circuit . It knows . It knows what you 're trying to do , Avon . It 's linked to the computer circuits . They 're feeding in a defensive program . I 'm going to put an explosive charge across the main energy feed . When it senses what I 'm trying to do , it should move away from you . - Towards you . - When it does , you move to the door . And when it homes in on you ? . I think my instinct for survival is more finely tuned than it is . It 's moving . Leave it now . Come on ! That is one I owe you . Don 't worry . At the right time , I will remind you of it . - Thanks . - You all right ? . Yes . Where 's Gan ? . Treatment unit . He tried to reconnect one of the servo links and it burned his hand . Right , sit down . No one is to attempt to repair any equipment till the computers are back under our control . What is it , Blake ? . What 's going on ? . The computers seem to be making decisions for themselves . They 're resisting all interference . - But that 's not possible ! - Avon ... It is if you think of the ship as a living entity , with massive networks of electronics acting as a nervous system . - All linked into a central computer . - The brain . Carry the analogy a stage further . When a living creature is hurt , a cut or a wound , antibodies gather around the injury to repair it and to fight infection . You mean the computers are treating us like germs ? . Crude , but accurate . But antibodies kill infection . Why are we still alive ? . We 're not sure . There are dozens of ways the ship could destroy us : . cut off the air supply , drop the temperature so we freeze to death ... Stop putting ideas into its head . Actually , one touch of that cable would have done it . No , I don 't think it wants to kill us . Well , not yet , anyway . It 's saving us for something . Dinner ? . Look , we 've been on the Liberator for a long time . The computers have never turned against us before . Why now ? . That 's what I was trying to find out when you sent for me . There 's something else I 'd like to try . [ DATATRANSFER ] It 's another computer . It 's communicating with Zen . Someone outside is controlling the Liberator . Yes , we know . But who and why ? . Blake . Yes , Gan . Blake , there 's something peculiar happening in the teleport section . I think the ... Cally , Vila , come on . It 's the teleport . I told you . I warned them to keep away from there . Gan ! He didn 't come past us . He must 've gone that way . - Go and see if you can find him . - Could he have operated the teleport ? . How and to where ? . Anyway , all the bracelets are still here . Then he is still onboard . Try and get him once more on the communicator . If you can 't reach him , give Vila a hand to find him . Gan , make your way to the flight deck immediately . Repeat : Make your way to the flight deck immediately . Gan ? . The energy banks are drained . We must be getting close to our destination . You 're sure there 's a pattern to all this ? . Very precise and carefully calculated . I think the takeover will be completed quite soon . Jenna , get the guns . We 're not giving this ship up without a fight . They 're white hot . White hot ? . All of them ? . They 've covered everything . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Blake . Cally . We 've made a thorough search . There 's no trace of Gan . All right , come back to the flight deck . Vila ? . Vila ? . I think the attack ships did exactly what they intended . They knocked out our manual control systems . Their blaster strike would have to be enormously accurate to cause selective damage . It could be done if they knew the vulnerable points . All right , but how could their computers override Zen ? . There 's a command code programmed into every system . Key that code , and the computers will only respond to orders from source . But who would know the code that operates Zen ? . It 's obvious , isn 't it ? . The people who built the Liberator ? . Just taking back what 's theirs . Redemption . [ STUN ROD DISCHARGE ] - Anything ? . - Nothing . Then there 's not a trace of any of them . Cally ! Gan ! I warned them to stay away from the teleport area . The people who built this ship will have the same teleport capability as we have . - They 'll use it to board us . - That doesn 't account for their disappearance . Unless they 've already boarded us . Ah , that would be logical . They 'll take us out a few at a time . They wouldn 't want to risk a full-scale battle . It might damage the ship . Isn 't there anything we can do to hold them off ? . No . Not unless we can regain control of the computers . I don 't see any way of doing that . - Let 's try Orac again . - What good will that do ? . Maybe he can analyse Zen 's programming and eradicate the override . - And bring Zen back under our instruction ? . - Right . Clear the receptor circuits to receive an emergency program . Confirm when ready . Confirm readiness . Come on , come on ! - What 's wrong ? . - You tell me . - Maybe it 's been taken over , too . - No , that 's not likely . Orac 's systems are entirely independent of all the Liberator 's . Now then , Orac . Are you going to function or are you not ? . All principal circuits are operating at full capacity and cannot receive new programs at this time . Well , clear the circuits . This is priority . Circuit clearance and reprogramming will take one hour and thirty-seven point nine seconds . That could be just a little late . State yourprogram requirements . They will be implemented when capacity is available . We want total analysis of Zen 's override system and erasure of that control . Eliminate any links with an external computer . Key the voice systems to respond only to the commands of Avon , myself , and Jenna . [ EXPLOSION ] Take control . I think we just lost our ship . The ship is now under our control . The three remaining crew are prisoners . Restore all operating functions and program for docking . [ DATATRANSFER ] - The repair circuits are working . - Zen , too . - Another few minutes and we 'll be fully operational . - Zen ! You will all remain under guard until docking is complete . Orders must be obeyed instantly . Failure will result in punishment . Where are the rest of my crew ? . At least tell us if they 're alive ! You will remain silent . That is an order . I accept that we are your prisoners , but I demand to know what has happened to my crew . Force level three . [ STUN ROD DISCHARGE ] All malfunctions have now been rectified . Systems are fully operational . Lock onto docking flight path . - Confirmed . - Release . You all right ? . Felt as though every nerve in my body was being scraped . You disobeyed an order . Further infractions will be dealt with more severely . - Screen forward vision . - Confirmed . - I don 't believe it ! - Impressive ... - I 've never seen a space station on that design before . - That 's more than just a station . - The technology ... - It 's the kind that built Liberator . Docking complete . Walkway to main hatch secured . - All flight systems off . - Confirmed . You will now walk towards the main hatch . Move . [ ORAC OPERATING ] Halt ! Take the leader . - Why are you separating us ? . - You are to be interrogated by the System . - The System ? . - What happens to us ? . You will remain in the detention section until the System decides on the method of your execution . - Execution ? . - Move them . You can 't do that ! What right have you got to destroy us ? ! . Sustained . Level five . Release . You were warned . A third time and I will command destruction level . Move . They 've gone . What are you looking for ? . Surveillance devices . You check the lock . I think it 's clean . Magno-lock . Probably linked to a central register . Jointed metal plate . No hope there . It might have possibilities if we had a heavy-duty cutter and a couple of explosive devices . Even if we do get out , we 're in space , Avon ; we 've got nowhere to go . So you 're just going to sit here and wait for them to eliminate us ? . You saw the size of this place . If we get out of here , we can run and we can hide . If they 're going to kill us , let us at least try and make it difficult for them . Stop ! March on . [ ALERT CHIME ] [ DATATRANSFER ] Acknowledged . There is disturbance on the control program . Until stable , all commands must be checked and confirmed . Acknowledged . - The System has questions to put to you . - I 'd like to ask one or two myself . - That is not permitted . - For instance , what is the System ? . The System is the supreme power of Spaceworld and the three life-supporting planets which orbit our sun . The System is a complex of infallible machines . All of this ? . You mean even you are computer controlled ? . We serve the System . Its questions and orders are routed through me , but the words and thoughts are those of the System . Is that understood ? . I demand your assurance that the rest of my crew remain unharmed . - Force level seven . - All right ! Understood . We will commence . State the circumstance by which you came to be aboard Deep Space Vehicle II . We call it the Liberator . It was found abandoned and drifting in space . I was part of a crew that was ... put on board . State the astral location in which you found DSV II . I don 't know it . My nearest point of reference is a Federation prison planet called Cygnus Alpha . State any further information you have regarding DSV II . We assumed it had been in a space battle . State any further information you have regarding ... regarding ... [ ALERT CHIME ] Circuitry disturbances are continuing . An outside influence has been analysed . We will resume the questioning when the disturbance has been rectified . It 's nice to know that computers can have their bad days , too . The System is infallible ! Orac ... Perhaps we could chew our way out . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Public Address : Attention all guards . Security report : Slave group number seven have attacked their escort and escaped . They are to be recaptured and eliminated . Repeat : recaptured and eliminated . - Jenna , come here . - What is it ? . - You remember Orac 's prediction ? . - That 's the least of our problems at the moment . I checked the star pattern behind Liberator . What Orac predicted was halfway across the galaxy . - I made a mental note of the configuration . - And ? . You 're looking at it . This is the Twelfth Sector . Astro point seven eight one . Exactly where Orac predicted we would be destroyed . [ ALERT CHIME ] Having a little trouble ? . The System confirms massive malfunctions . Emergency programs are to be activated . T ransfer all prisoners to elimination chamber four , sentence to be carried out immediately . Look , wait a minute , wait a minute ! Take this prisoner to elimination chamber two . Hey ! - Thanks . - Shhh ! - Where are we ? . - It 's an old service lift Those young guards , they don 't even know it exists . Listen , I 've got to get to the detention block . Do you know where it is ? . - I 'll show you . - Good . - Where do you come from ? . - Planet called Earth . - Earth ? . - How long 's all this been here ? . - From before my father was born . - Before that ? . Those times ? . The three planets were always fighting or getting ready to fight . Sounds familiar . Then one of the planets developed a computer so powerful , it was able to take over the weaponry computers of the other two . So all three became one ? . One gigantic System that totally governs the three worlds . And the System built this as a control centre ? . - Yes , now there 's no war , no famine ... - And no freedom . Yes . The System uses people . We are flexible , adaptable , expendable . What about the ones that give the orders ? . The Altas ? . They 're linked into the System . They 're not really people at all . [ CRACKING SOUND OUTSIDE DOOR ] I 'm ... sorry , Vila . - Been looking all over for you two . - How did you get here ? . I was just passing , thought I 'd drop in and see you . - Where are Gan and Cally ? . - In a cell along the corridor . - Well , what kept you ? . - Magno-locks aren 't that easy to open . Even for me . - Practice . Let 's go . - Just a minute . Where 's Blake ? . - They took him away for questioning . - Questioning ? . - I don 't think we should hang around . - No , neither do I. - What did you do to your head ? . - One of the guards didn 't like me . Come on ! What are we going to do ? . Try and get back on Liberator . She 's fully operational . It 's our only chance . What about Orac 's prophecy ? . As you said , right now that 's the least of our problems . There they are . Stop ! [ GUNFIRE ] [ EXPLOSION ] Go on , I 'll hold them ! Gan , don 't just stand there ! Come on ! Raise your hands . Turn round . Kill them . Destruction level ! Come on ! - Through that door . - Right . Look out ! Right . Get the ship moving and fast ! Jenna ! Right . Come on ! - I 'll stay here . - Blake , come on ! [ ALARM BELL ] Zen ! Prepare immediate launch ! Confirmed . - Zen , hundred-eighty turn , full lateral thrust . - Confirmed . Cally , quick ! Destruct ... destruct ... destruct ... Walkway severed . Main hatch closed . Give me rear vision . - We 're out ! - We 've made it ! Well done , Jenna ! Information . Sensors register secondary launch , a space vehicle in pursuit . Speed , Standard by Fourteen . Vila , ready the weaponry system . We 'll make a fight of it . - It 's too late , Blake , we 're lost . - Do it , Vila ! - Blake , there 's no point . - Orac 's prediction is coming true . She 's right ; we are in the precise location where Orac predicted our destruction . - It hasn 't happened yet ! - Pursuit ship moving into missile attack . - Cally , put her on the screen . - There she is . The same ship . The same as Liberator . That 's it . It 's a sister ship . That 's what Orac showed us . It wasn 't the Liberator . Sister ship or not , she 's coming at us . - Well , activate the force wall . - Sensors register missile emission . Blake , there is no point in going on , we 're finished . At this range we haven 't a chance . She can 't miss us . [ EXPLOSION ] - Vila , did you fire ? . - No . Well , what happened ? . I took the precaution of scrambling their launch system . It pre-detonated their missiles . Had I not , my prediction would have been inaccurate . Orac , you are a genius . Next time let us know what you 're planning . I am closing down . I have much to do . You have engaged my circuits on your petty affairs for far too long . Thank you , Orac . Zen , take over . State course and speed . Speed Standard by Three , Earth Sector . We have unfinished business with the Federation . Oh no , not again ... Why Earth Sector ? . - Would you rather stay here ? . - You make them sound like the only alternatives . They are , for us . Go back to your position .

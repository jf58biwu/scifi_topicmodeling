 I 'm afraid you 've both fallen into the trap of attributing human characteristics to a flexible casing with circuits . They can easily program a machine to have a child 's mind , a child 's ... - Why would they do that ? - I don 't know why . But I can soon find out . I 'll open it up . No , you keep away from it . Look , Steel , Steel , Steel , Steel . I am the technician ... and there 's no machine - past , present or future - that I cannot handle . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' 'Let it follow you . 'I want to get behind it . Go on , make it follow you ! ' 'You can 't kill it , Steel . You can 't hurt it . ' 'Touch them both . ' No ! 'Touch them . ' I won 't ! 'It tried to resist something . ' 'Yes . ' 'Whatever controls it . ' 'The time source ? ' 'It must be . ' 'Well , what is he ? ' 'A human transmutation . You could call it a changeling . ' 'Changeling ? ' 'A substitute child . 'It 's old folklore , 'except that this child hasn 't been substituted for another . ' - He 's been substituted for himself ? - Give or take 30 years . I wonder what he did to Silver ? What he did to everything else . Like the door . - I think he sent him back . - To where ? To the beginning , to his beginnings . Maybe even further than that . What is it ? I was trying to imagine but it 's impossible . - Imagine what ? - Silver having a childhood . That 's strange . My thoughts exactly . - About Silver ? - No , about you . He 's the baby from this room . Yes . I have very positive origins . Inexpressible , maybe ... but positive . Without Silver , we 'll never get out of this capsule . - What about the parents ? - What are you gonna do ? - But ... - Try to get him back . If he has sent Silver back to a time when he never even existed ... What did you say ? What about the parents of that child ? He could have hardly sent them back , the child itself wouldn 't exist . It wouldn 't be here . Maybe he sent them in different directions . Yes , the opposite direction . Remember the hands ? - Left hand ... - The past . - Right hand ... - The future . - Well , it could be . - It could be , yes . There must be a power system somewhere . There must be the machinery . This room is very special . It 's the only one that isn 't pretending to be something else . - Room from the future ? - Yes , but how does it work ? - There 's no machinery , nothing . - Nothing we can see . Well , how did it get here ? How do we send it back ? We can 't send it back without its crew . All right , while we 're waiting for them to reappear , what do you suggest we do ? - I 've no idea . - Precisely . So get Silver back . - Now ? - Now . You 're not forgetting the time source ? - Only I thought you were worried . - Worried ? That it 's all gone too smoothly , that we got in here too easily . No , I 'm not forgetting the time source and yes , I 'm worried . - Good . - Now , take time back . To when the three of us ... were together ... in the living room ? See you back there . 'I have impeccable origins . ' Oh ... no . Oh , no ! Day 27 . Experimental project ES stroke five stroke treble seven . Urban examination and observation . Time of day , 8 : 27 am . I 'd like to report a transference failure ... 'Time is the measure of durational continuous existence 'without reference to extension in space . - ' Absolute time is unrelated to ... ' - You see , we stopped receiving ... ' ... unlimited and infinitely divisible . 'Relative time , by which duration is measured 'with reference to events . 'Sidereal time is based on rotation of the earth with respect to ... ' Silver ! I 'm afraid you 've both fallen into the trap of attributing human characteristics to a flexible casing ... 'Steel ! ' 'Steel ! ' 'Time as measured by clocks , chronometers , etc 'is computed on the basis of an average or mean solar day ... 'which is always the same length and has no real existence . ' Why can 't you work in there ? - It 's impossible ! - Then try the screen room . It must be the room Silver was last in . - What 's stopping you ? - The room itself ! - It 's alive . - With what ? With time . It knew your reasons for going in ? What other reason would it have for setting up a barrier like that ? So you are unable to take time back ? Under these circumstances , yes . I haven 't got the power . - Yeah , but it has . - Obviously . - Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? - Yes , the same thoughts . You can 't use your powers and I can 't do what I 've been sent to do and take this capsule back because the crew aren 't here . We 've lost our technician . The only one who can get us out and get us in . He 's a ... useful sort of person , isn 't he ? I miss him . There 's a time field outside this place and now apparently a time barrier within . - What did you do ? - When ? When you entered the room . Did you prepare things , what ? L - I just thought about what I had to do to get Silver back . - You only had to think it ? - Yes . Think it now . - ' Steel ? ' - ' Yes , I saw that . 'Come back here . ' - The roof . - Yes , but the past or the future ? - It could have been either . - ' Try it here . Take time back here , 'when you and I and Silver first came out from the screen room . 'Try that . ' - So which one did you try ? - The master pad . Well , we usually get an instant signal back from that , don 't we ? Yes . - That was ... - People from the future . Well ... why were they dressed like that ? As part of their experiment . Did you expect something different ? Some sort of transmitter , Silver said . Yes , and a monitor . Something that sees us , watches us . Well , there 's probably one in every room . Maybe there is nothing tangible . Maybe there doesn 't need to be . Steel ? It 's here . I 'm in line with it here . Do you remember on the roof ? 'Yes , I 'm in line with it here . ' Yes , I remember . It 's very powerful , Steel . It can do anything . - Try to communicate with it ! - I can 't possibly ! - Is it only a machine ? - Yes ! Capable of ... doing anything it wants . Yes . - Capable of everything ? - Yes . Those clever people of the future with their brilliant minds , - they harnessed it and used it ... - ' Remember . ' Oh ! Oh ! No ! Oh ! The pain ! It 's all right . It 's all right ! It 's all right . Wait here . It moved . Good . - Anything now ? - No . If only we knew how these walls were constructed . It could be anywhere . Yes , it has a right to be anywhere in this capsule . It could have access to any part of it ... built in . - What were those noises ? - Sounds of pain . What 's that ? The whole capsule is built like that . Let 's see if ... You 'll never shift it . Silver could . Yes , Silver probably could . Maybe there is a way of getting him back . - Steel ? - A quick way ... Look . - Blood . - It 's animal blood . Animal blood ? What exactly are they guilty of ? - What is their time source ? - That 's capable of everything ? Well , there 's one thing it hasn 't been capable of doing . Something disobeyed it , remember ? The left hand the past , the right the future . What if ... - It 's dangerous . - I live dangerously . - What if you disappeared too ? - You 'd have to cope . - You know what it can do . - Very well . - It 's watching you , listening ! - That 's what I 'm relying on ! - You cannot take that chance ! - All right ! All right . I 'm just gonna talk to it . What is your name ? - Name ? - Yes . You must have a name . We want to help you . We want to give you back the things you need . Sleep ... and warmth ... and food . Those are the things you want ... aren 't they ? Well ... we are going to help you ... get those things back . You 'd like that , wouldn 't you ? You 'd like that a lot . We 're going to give you everything you want . And you know what ? We 're going to send you back . Send you back ... where you belong . 'No ! 'He will hurt you . ' No ! Rothwyn ! - The past again ? - This is the present . The present ? Your child . He 's quite safe . We 've brought him back for you . - From where ? - Don 't ask them anything . - I need to know what happened . - Don 't even talk to them ! I believe you now . The things , the things you said you 'd seen . - We 're both imagining things ! - We are not . - Of course we are ! - These people are real . - Well , aren 't you ? - Yes , we 're real . - What are your names ? - How can they possibly be real ? How could we possibly not be ? - What are your names ? - Tell him . - We can 't ! - He 's Eldred , I 'm Rothwyn . - Names from the past . - Yes . But you 're from the future . - Am I right ? - You 're right . And there 's only the three of you ? Well , tell me . Ye ... Yes . There 's only the three of us here . - But it 's impossible ! - What ? Them being here . No one can enter this place . - No one can get in . - No ? No one from this time period . Where are you from ? Please wait here until you 're needed . Psst .

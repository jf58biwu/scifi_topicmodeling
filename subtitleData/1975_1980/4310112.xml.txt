 ( Paul ) Alpha to Eagle 1. come in . 1 . Alpha to Eagle 1. come in . 1 . ( Man ) ' Eagle 1 to base. we copy . ' Paul. we 're returning to Alpha . 'Returning ? ' We had a close call . We were descending at normal speed and were suddenly pulled down at tremendous speed . As if the G-forces had increased enormously . I checked that out . John . G-forces remained constant . No other force was recorded on the instruments . Whatever force it was . it wasn 't anything we know about . - Did you get that . Paul ? - ' Heard but not understood . ' It took all our power to get away . ( Crackling ) - We 're losing power ! - Paul. we 're in trouble ! ( John ) ' Control systems out ! ' Alpha to Eagle 1. come in . 1 . 'Alpha to Eagle 1. come in . 1 . ' 'Alpha to Eagle 1. come in . 1 . ' Paul . Computer 's located them . They crashed down in a crater . Over 100 miles from here . 'Medical. physical condition ? ' Three are alive . Paul . I can 't get a reading from Commander Koenig . Bob. his medical monitor is not registering . 'Get the medical team to launch pad seven . ' We 're on our way . - Paul. any word from them yet ? - ' Nothing . Doctor . 'But their communications systems are working now . 'We may hear from them at any moment . - ' How 's the Commander ? ' - Still no life readings . Keep me posted . Paul . Come in . Eagle 4 . Come in . Eagle 4 . This is Commander Koenig . ( Groans ) Commander ? 'Alpha calling Eagle 1 . come in . Eagle 1 . 'Alpha calling Eagle 1 . ' Come in . Eagle 1 . ( Alan ) ' Tanya. you 've got the most beautiful voice in the world . ' Paul . - Eagle 1 reporting in . - Commander Koenig ? No. it 's Carter . Paul . 'Are you all right ? ' Yeah. but the Commander 's hurt pretty bad . Do what you can . Alan . A rescue unit 's on its way . - We 'll have you home in no time . - ' Make it soon . ' Dr Russell. we 've heard from Carter . Commander Koenig 's alive . - but badly hurt . - Thank you . Paul . ( Beep ) ( Beep ) Paul. this is Commander Koenig . Paul ? Dr Russell ? Helena ? ( Beeping ) ( Beep ) ( Helena ) ' Alan. this is Dr Russell . 'We 're coming alongside now . 'Don 't move anyone until I 've examined them . ' He 's going to be OK. isn 't he ? I don 't know . We can 't do any more without getting them to Alpha . Paul ? Yes . Alan . Go ahead . 'Send us a cargo Eagle as fast as you can . We can 't move anyone . ' We 'll have to separate this section and have it carried to Alpha . Affirmative . ( Beep ) ( Beep ) Paul ! ( Beep ) ( Beep ) I hope you enjoy your stay here on Zenno . Commander Koenig . You must be exhausted after your long walk . It is not a dream . but all very real . I assure you . This is the planet Zenno . the major planet in the solar system known as Cryton . Five million light years away from Earth . Our computer checked every planet here . They 're all dead . Yes . Of course . Your primitive machinery would record that fallacy . simply because I ordered it to . - You expect me to believe that ? - Why should I lie ? You 're thinking that our scanner system located your moon and you were brought here by spaceship - that is correct . I can read your mind. you see . All Zennites can . We have no use of mechanical devices . What we need. or want . we create with our minds . The mind is master of all things . This is my home . It is made of light . Outside is our city. one of many . You are still sceptical . Admirable . Perhaps another view ? A closer one . Gently . Commander . You will adjust to it in time . The city of light . Light is alive . colour is alive . Magnificent . At last you are impressed . Allow me to impress you even further . My name is Raan. your host . I am as human as you are . ( Koenig ) This must be a dream . ( Raan ) No . Commander . It all happened here on Zenno . I made it happen . See for yourself . Convinced ? Why am I here ? The inevitable question . - Because ... - ( Woman ) Because ... my father is the foremost anthropologist on Zenno . You have not met formally . Vana. may I present Commander Koenig . Commander Koenig. my daughter . Vana . You were saying ? Like all scientists ' . my father 's curiosity is insatiable . He wants to learn from you . I doubt if I could teach him anything . Not about the present . or the future. but the past . And now let us make you feel more comfortable. more at home . Your quarters on Alpha . I 'm sorry it 's not the real thing . only an image of it . but quite accommodating nevertheless . Then . I take it I 'm a prisoner here . Oh. no . No. no. no . You are a guest in my home . A permanent guest . Unfortunately. your life span is only one tenth of ours . I still don 't see what you hope to learn from me . I want to know your mind . The mind of an Earth man . All our ancient books . though very informative . are limited in knowledge . But you. dear Commander Koenig . are flesh and blood . You 're real . I 've been searching for such as you for a long time . You are our missing link . - We 're all set. lower away . - ' All right . Alan . ' When they 've secured the module . I 'll take over here . - ' Piece of cake . ' - Just keep your fingers crossed . ( Vana ) Your food . Commander . Fattening me up for the slaughter ? You must eat . I suggest you resign yourself to the situation . ( Laughs ) My being considered the caveman of the future is your idea of a situation ? Do you know what your father intends ? To use me as an experiment . like some kind of ... Some kind of ... - animal . - Exactly . Yes . I 've read of Earth people and their experiments with animals . Exposing their brains and implanting electrical devices to record thought processes . But if that is all he wanted to learn from you . he would simply read your mind . - As I would . - The principle is exactly the same . I am being kept here against my will for scientific research . What your father proposes is just as inhumane . Or have the Zennites progressed beyond principles ? I assure you . no harm will come to you . Vana . I 'm not a Zennite . What 's not harmful to you may be to me . Tell your father I 'll do everything I can to get back to Alpha . That is impossible . You will remain here till the end of your life . Then that day 'll come a lot sooner ! 'Alpha to Eagle 7. all secured . Alan. hang on . ' Ready for pick-up . Countdown ... 10 seconds . - Nine. eight. seven ... - Six. five. four. three . 'two. one . - ' zero . ' - ( Rocket blast ) ( Bleep bleep ) ( Raan ) No need to open the door . Commander . In my first experiment . I am returning you to Alpha . John . It 's all right . You 're safe now . You 've been unconscious for two days . The others ? Carter and I made it through all right. but ... Sandra 's dead . - Sandra ? - Mm-hmm . Helena did everything she could to save her . but it meant nothing . The whole thing is ridiculous . I mean ... We 're all of us gonna die . Slowly . One by one . It 's no use . Come on . Victor . I feel the same way about Sandra . but we all know that death 's a way of life with us now . Don 't philosophise . John . Not with me . I 'm not talking about Sandra ! I 'm talking about everything . When are we gonna stop kidding ourselves ? We 're never going to get off this rock . This is our tomb . We walk about breathing . but we 're not living. we 're existing . I tell you . I 've had about enough of it . I wanna live like a human being again . - We all do . Victor . - Oh. no . Not you . You 're the big man around here . How does it feel to play God every day ? Where are you going ? I want to talk to Paul . What for ? Listen. we don 't have a chance here . If you want to check out . that 's your affair . - Open any air lock . - No ! I want to live ! Listen. all those planets out there . they 're not all dead. you know . One of them 's alive . Alive ! We can go there . A few of us . We can start living again . Don 't be a damn fool ! Life is waiting for us . John . Let 's take it . That 's just another way to die . Paul ! 'Commander. you should have listened to Victor . ' Raan ! I 'm not an experiment . I 'm a man ! I 'm a man ! Raaaaaan ! ( Snarls ) ( Scream ) ( Laughs ) ( Shouts ) Let go ! Let go . ( Cackles ) Noooooooo ! ( Screams ) Victor ? Help me . Victor . Help me . Victor ! Help me ! Help me . Victor ! Victor. help me ! Victor ! Help me . Victor ! Help me ! Help me . ( Screams ) Victor ! His fear of my experiment manifested itself in strange . repulsive creatures . who appeared real and alive to him . But it 's his violence I find most fascinating . I find violence very disturbing . It is frightening . Had I been present when he realised Professor Bergman was an image . I do believe he would have taken my life . I can see how the ancient books do not exaggerate . Murder. war. torture . violence beyond description is a way of life for Earth man . Perhaps he will prove too dangerous . He may truly kill one of us . You should neutralise his mind . You may go too far . No . I can create situations for him . but his reactions must be true and his choice of dealing with them free . otherwise there 'd be no point in making the experiment . He must neutralise his own mind . Conquer his violence . There were four of us in that crash . Three 'll survive and ... John ... Why him ? Why couldn 't it be me or Alan or Sandra ? It may simply be John 's time to die . Commander . It was very wise to realise that your friend was not real . But I do not see how you knew . Victor would never give up on himself . I wanted him to be real . otherwise . I 'd have seen through your father 's deception much sooner . We are incapable of deception . ( Scoffs ) Every scientist makes that claim . The end justifies the means . I am too young to understand my father 's reasoning . But I know he did not intend to deceive you . We Zennites are born free of negative emotions . thereby bringing us tranquillity and peace . You see. however . it does not come easily - or swiftly . - You 're lucky . Or are you ? Without feeling hate . one cannot feel the joy of love . We feel such joy . because we understand hate . It is born of fear and we fear nothing . - Except death . - We do not believe in death . Only in the continuing flow of life . Therefore. your refusing food . your choice to starve yourself . is incomprehensible to me . If I were to take you away from here . against your will . you 'd understand . If you were to remain here . of your own free will . you also would understand . You clumsy fool ! Is it so difficult to carry a tray of coffee ? That 's enough . Kano . - This inefficient ... - I said that 's enough ! - Are you all right . June ? - Yes . Don 't ever do that again . - You 're not in command here yet . - Right now I 'm off duty . So are you . Paul . Everyone back to their stations . ( Groans ) ( Beeping ) ( Screams ) Raise it three points . That could kill him . Three points . ( Groans ) ( Groans ) ( Helena ) That 's enough . Have you got him ? Only just . As a scientist . I owe it to humanity to learn all I can . It is the only way to help man . To bring him closer to his true destiny . But you can learn nothing from the Commander because whatever image you present to him is unreal . so that his reaction . though honest. is unreal as well . To explore our own minds . and the mind of the universe . for knowledge and understanding . that is a good thing . But John Koenig is neither of these . He 's an individual . His blood is our blood . We have no right to exploit him . Do you wish me to send him back ? I don 't know . It 's all so confusing . I was just thinking of you . I know . ( Music plays ) You can project music with your mind ? You like it ? It 's beautiful . But so sad . I didn 't think sadness existed here . It does . It does . Tell me what 's troubling you . You know I can 't read your mind . I want you to stay . I want you to stay with me . Dr Russell . You must not let him die . A machine is keeping John alive . Not himself. not me . What difference does it make ? He is still alive . John is already dead . His body is dead and his mind . I can 't deceive myself any longer . Wait . Please wait a while longer . ( Vana ) Look. there are wonders out there beyond your imagination . Everything you 've wished for on Earth . The good things . I offer you . A world without fear . ( Koenig ) A world without fear . ( Raan ) Not your world . Commander . ( Vana ) It will be . Father . We are to be united as one . That is impossible . But you have taught me that love is the bridge between all worlds . Only when you know how to cross it . You have yet to learn the way . Do you presume that you can span two million years of evolution ? I can try . I 've made my choice . I want to stay here with Vana . No one 's being callous . just realistic . The entire base is pulling for the Commander to make it . But you can see the effect it 's having . Kano losing his temper . Me as well . Security have broken up three brawls already . - That is not the point ! - That is precisely the point . Alan . We need a leader . even if it 's just a name . If John lives. that 's fine . Even if he doesn 't . people will adjust . It 's not knowing getting us down . And who 's going to take over. you ? You . Paul ? Kano ? The man in the moon ! Koenig is still breathing ! And while he is. for my money . he is still the Commander . You 're beautiful . I think this is also a friend of yours . ( Laughs ) No. no . The Commander does not believe you are real . I have instilled the facts in her mind . Where she is and the situation . But not her part in it . That I leave to you . ( Sandra ) It is true . Commander . I know you have decided not to return to Alpha . Father. did you have to bring Sandra here ? You see ? My daughter believes Sandra is real . She trusts you . I don 't . Very well . Commander Koenig . Let me offer some proof . There is my image of Sandra . And my image of you . However. your image on Alpha is dying . Even I cannot sustain it indefinitely . Only one of you will survive . Dr Russell is going to disconnect your life support system . She believes you are dead . - Now I can tell her ... - No . You will not remember seeing the Commander alive and well . The decision still belongs to Dr Russell . I cannot influence that decision in any way . No one can . You brought Victor 's image here . - Why not Sandra 's ? - Sandra is real . I understand not believing her because of my father . Can you not believe me ? I believe you . Excellent . Which world do you choose now ? Come . Vana . We should allow our guests a moment to themselves . It is like a dream . ( Koenig ) It 's not a dream . Sandra . ( Moans ) There 's nothing more you can do for him . There is one thing . Vana . Sandra has convinced you to return . No . Vana . Your father only made me face the truth by bringing Sandra here . I can 't stay. knowing my place is with my own people . in my own time . I will come with you . I 'm already part of your world . as you 're part of mine . It 's the same for you . The Zennites are your people . and this is your time . You and I can never become one . In time you 'll understand . What do I do till then ? At this moment. all I understand is my love for you . I do not want you to leave me . Then cross the bridge between your world and mine . I do not know how . With your mind . And with your heart . As long as you think of me and feel for me . I 'll be with you . I will try . I will try . Do not forget me . Do not forget me . Are you sure ? ( Sniffs ) I have to . Bob . Leave it alone . Dr Russell . You don 't understand ! You 're not gonna kill him . - Carter. take it easy . - Not over this . Take it easy . ( Clatter ) Security to Diagnostic . Security to Diagnostic . You 're not gonna kill him ! Although the experiment was a failure . I did learn something from Earth man after all. so did Vana . Perhaps Vana was the true reason you brought me here . Perhaps it was . Please take my gratitude with you . I 'll be taking much more . Something YOU learned . I hope . Not exactly . I still believe it 's more important to feel than to think . It is the perfect balance between the two that must be achieved . Both our worlds have yet to learn how . But now you must hurry . There 's not much of your time left . Until tomorrow . John Koenig . Until tomorrow . Helena . Have I been gone long ? Not long .

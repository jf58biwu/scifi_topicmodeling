 Father , I think they intend to ram . ( Apollo ) He 's going for the bridge ! - We 're too far inside to take a laser hit . - That was something else . Work that boraton in over there . Come on , keep it moving . Look out , it 's ready to blow ! They could still be alive ! You can 't just leave them there ! The Galactica is doomed . Just don 't get careless . Lose your grip , you 'll be floating in space forever . ( Starbuck ) Thanks for reminding us , Sheba . I 'm going to have to operate . - There 's a fragment near his heart . - Then operate . There 's no way I 'm opening up his chest under these conditions . - ( Muffit barks ) - Well , Boxey , you did it to me again . Yeah , isn 't this fun , Athena ? That 's easy to say when you 're winning . Hey , Boomer , what are you doing in the Rejuvenation Centre ? I thought Blue Squadron was on alert . Even Blue Squadron pilots get a furlon once in a while . Now all I have to do for the next 24 centares is relax . Want to play compartment billyarks ? I 'm pretty good . Oh ? You 're on . And if you beat me , I got a surprise for you . - lt 's a mushie . - How 's a guy keep a secret around here ? You can 't with Muffy . I trained him to sniff out mushies . ( Alarm ) Commander . Looks like a Cylon combat probe . Probably from that base ship we eluded 10 centares ago . Launch Blue Squadron to intercept . That 's not a combat probe . - They 're mounting a major attack . - Launch all squadrons . Colonel Tigh , prepare the Galactica for heavy attack . Secure all compartments . Must be an all-out attack ! OK , everybody , just go back to what you were doing . Nobody 's going anywhere until this is over . Why did they close the doors ? If one part of the Galactica gets hit it won 't affect the rest . That prevents the oxygen from escaping if the hull is pierced . I 'm not afraid . My dad 'll protect us from those old Cylons . Blue Leader to Galactica , this is no probe ! Affirmative . All squadrons have been launched . - There must be a hundred of them . - More to shoot at . Let 's go ! Follow the programmed mission . Ignore the Colonial vipers . They 're not fighting back . - What are they up to ? - Let 's take advantage of it . - Where 's that help ? - They 're right behind us . All squadrons engaged , sir , but something 's wrong . We 're outnumbered but they don 't seem to be fighting back . Galactica , this is Apollo . Two from the first wave have broken through . Our laser turrets will take care of them . - Father , I think they intend to ram ! - Positive shield , now ! One micron to impact coordinates . He 's going for the bridge ! Galactica bridge , come in . Come in ! He 's heading for the landing bay . I can 't get him in time . Five microns to impact . He 's gonna ram ! Oh , my God ! - OK ? - Yeah . - We 're too far inside to take a laser hit . - That was something else . Apollo calling Commander Adama . Come in . Come in ! Commander ! Adama . Get Dr Salik fast ! - Stay still . - ( Groans ) - Adama ? - ( Groans ) Casualty report ? I don 't know yet , Commander . Damage ? It 's bad . Those Cylon fighters must have been packed with solenite . But we 'll make it . The boraton mist handled what fire there was . Colonel Tigh ! Deep scan has been knocked out . Internal communications , too . We 've lost deep scan . We 're setting up an emergency radio system right now . Try and repair internal communications . I want those scanners operational . Colonel , the scanners have had it ! They 're completely destroyed . Vipers will be our eyes . - lnform the pilots . - Yes , sir . Fractures . The man 's taken a lot of fragments . Get the Commander to the Life Centre at once . - Work that boraton in over there ! - lt 's spreading ! ( Coughing ) Hold that tight until the bleeding stops . I 'll check on the others . Galactica , this is Captain Apollo . Port landing bay has been destroyed . - Request instructions . - Two squadrons will remain flying . ( Tigh ) ' Blue and Red Squadrons cleared for starboard landing bay . ' Colonel , energiser number one destroyed . Number two now operating at maximum capacity . Boraton mist control centre destroyed . Fire out of control in Alpha deck , Beta and Gamma sections . All personnel evacuated in fire areas except for the Rejuvenation Centre . It 's been cut off . - How many in there ? - About 20 . including Boomer ... and the Commander 's daughter and his grandson . Did you find out what happened ? No , Boxey , the telecom 's dead . First-aid supplies have been destroyed too . ( Barks ) - Look ! - Boomer ! - Break out the life masks ! - They were destroyed too . ( Muffit barks ) Watch it ! It 's going to flare ! Hold it as long as you can . Maybe the locking mechanism shorted . No , it 's a fire , and it 's a bad one . Everybody get to the other side of the compartment . Move ! All of those who aren 't injured , please help those who are . Easy . Right here . Frack ! The bulkhead twisted just enough to jam the door . What chance of the other door holding ? About as much as the Cylons throwing me a birthday party . If I can get this one open , we can get into the storage compartment and close it behind us . - Life masks in there , too . - How are you gonna do it ? It doesn 't show in my file , Athena , but when I was a kid I hot-linked more hovermobiles than there are doors on this ship . If the fire can get through that door , it can get through this one . By then , we 'll be through into the next compartment . Ah . And the next one , and the next one . How long before you think you can do it ? If this were a hovermobile , I could tell you . But this thing ... I don 't know . Why don 't you take a rest period ? - lt 's all right. I 'll watch him . - Thank you , sir . Please ... Tell the Commander we tried . We just couldn 't reach them . - Couldn 't reach who ? - His daughter and grandson . In the Rejuvenation Centre . - Boxey and Athena ? - And Boomer , too . I saw them go in there before the attack . We tried but the fire ... Oh , my God . Where is he ? Yes . Comfortable ? The Galactica ? We took some casualties , some damage . Nothing that can 't be repaired - including you . Rest , Adama . You need rest . The life pod has him stabilised but he 's very weak . I 'm going to have to operate . There 's a fragment lodged near the wall of his heart . Then operate . Right now . You listen to me , son . Unless I have no choice , there 's no way I 'm going to open up his chest under these conditions . The fire has knocked out one energiser . And if the other one goes , as well it may , all of the equipment will go out . You don 't want me poking around your father 's heart with a laser scalpel at a time like that . Now , be brief , please . Apollo . We tried to get him sooner but he was too far ahead . I know . It wasn 't your fault . - Can I do anything for you ? - You 're doing it ... just by being here . I want to see Athena and Boxey . I 'm sorry but the doctor says no more visitors . I 'll be all right . - l 'll be fine . - Come on . It 's all right , Apollo. I 'll stay with him . I 'll be on the bridge . Don 't let it get behind you . Look out ! Get back ! We 're losing it here . We have to fall back . ( Apollo ) Are you sure there 's nothing you can do ? I 'm sorry , we couldn 't get to them . And all the doors are jammed . But we have to find out if they 're alive . Communications have been restored on this side . - The other side is still out . - Colonel , if they 're alive , how long could they last ? The truth . I don 't know . The fire is rapidly consuming oxygen in that area . Once it 's gone they 'll have to rely on life masks . When the door opens , get him through as quickly as possible . All right , we 're set ! When this door opens - if it opens - we get Boxey and the injured through first . And make it fast. I don 't know how long l 'll be able to keep it open . Boomer , the fire . The door . I wish this were a hovermobile . ( Woman ) Oh , no . Wait a micron , I think I got it figured out now . Change the wavelon ... This ought to do it . Either that , or burn out the motor so it 'll never open . - Here we go . - Hurry , Boomer . Hurry . Come on , hurry up ! Move it ! Move , move ! Let 's go ! Grab the wounded ! Let 's go , Athena ! Boomer , what about you ? Get going ! Get going ! Move ! Come on , Boomer ! Come on ! Boxey , it looks like I , erm ... mashed your mushie . ( Static ) This telecom 's dead . Boomer , there 's only five life masks . Great . OK . We 'll save them until we need them and then we 'll all take turns . Now , let 's check out this door . - Are you OK ? - Yeah , I 'm OK . This thing is red-hot . From the landing bay , the fire is advancing through Beta section , towards the energiser , - and here through Gamma section . - Toward the solium tanks . If it gets there , we 'll go up like a supernova . Colonel , this duct system connects the Rejuvenation Centre with other areas of the ship , including right here , the bridge ! These ducts are too small for a person to get through . An adult but what about a small boy ? Boomer would never take a chance with Boxey 's life . - He could send Muffy ! - lt wouldn 't do any good . - Why not ? ! - l 'll show you . That duct system terminates in 30 compartments , only one of which is on the bridge . The chance of the daggit getting here is remote . Send men out to wait until Muffy shows up ! I can 't afford to send anyone . I barely have manpower to run the ship and fight the fire . I 'm sorry . Even if I thought there was a chance ... They could still be alive ! You can 't just leave them there ! Apollo , if the fire reaches the energiser or the solium , either one , the Galactica is doomed . Our resources must go into preventing that . I 'm sorry , Colonel . We may delay it , but in the end , we can 't prevent it . The oxygen in each compartment draws the fire into the ship like a magnet . To stop it we have to drown it in boraton . We have boraton . But we have to smother the whole fire at the same time . With enough high pressure we could do that in the other areas but not the landing bay - there 's no way to reach it . Hold it , I have an idea . Replace the lasers in three vipers with megapressure pumps . Fill them with boraton and connect them to the firing mechanism . - lt would be like a strafing run . - Exactly ! - We could flood that bay with boraton ! - l never thought of the pumps . I could use one of them to boost the pressure in our hose system . - Do it ! - Yes , sir ! Apollo , they 're gonna be OK . They 'll be waiting when we get back . If this works . Boraton is heavy , so we 're overloaded . When you pull up , watch it or the G-factor will slam you into the hull . - Boraton flight cleared to launch . - Acknowledged . This fumarello case will protect the note . - OK , Boxey . - Go get help , Muffy ! You can do it . ( Barking ) Don 't let up ! If it gets to the solium cells , we 've all had it ! Fall back ! Fall back ! ( Barks ) Tie down the hose and fall back ! Colonel . The megapressure pump is ready . Apollo , we 're ready . Commence the boraton run . I 'll make the first pass , Starbuck , then you , then Sheba . - Let 's make it good . - l 'm right behind you . ( Sheba ) Let 's go . Yes , sir , Colonel ! Right away ! The vipers are ready . Start the megapressure pump . Here we go . Easy ... Easy ... Now ! Watch it , Starbuck . The G-factors are worse than I thought . I still have to get in close to do any good . ( Apollo ) ' Your angle 's too steep ! ' ( Starbuck ) Easier than shooting at Cylons ! ( Apollo ) ' Pull up , Starbuck ! Pull up ! ' ( Apollo ) ' l thought you weren 't gonna make it . ' l knew exactly what I was doing . - ( Apollo ) ' This has to do it . Make it good . ' - l will . - We got it ! - ( Apollo ) ' We got the landing bay . 'Now it 's up to the guys inside to put the rest of it out . ' Colonel Tigh , we 've lost it here . 'The megapressure pump must have blown a seal ! ' You did what you could . Use the regular pumps and keep me advised . We didn 't get it . Keep moving in ! That 's the fourth power drop . He gets worse with each one . - Prepare to operate . - What about the power drops ? Cassiopeia , they 're already killing him . If we just let him lie in that life pod , he doesn 't have a chance . I 'll notify Tigh. I 'll be in ultrasonic scrub . We 've got to keep it away from the energiser ! Watch those supports . They 've been weakened . Adama . I understand they 're going to fix you up . - How bad is it , Tigh ? - You 'll come through fine , just fine . I know about the fire . It 's bad , Adama . We can 't put the fire out . There 's a way . A drastic way . If nothing else , let the vacuum of space smother it . Put explosive charges on the hull . Blow hole . Deprive the fire of its oxygen . People may be trapped in there . Without oxygen they 'd never survive . Do you really believe Athena and Boxey ... are still alive ? How did you know ? I overheard a great deal . I 'm sorry , Colonel. lt 's time . Tigh . Put your best people on the job . It may be our last chance . Yes , sir . ( Tigh ) ' Apollo and Starbuck are in the airlock . - ' Are you ready , Sheba ? ' - ' Coming into position now . ' ( Tigh ) ' Can you see them yet ? ' ( Sheba ) ' l have them in view . - ' l won 't let ' em out of my sight . ' - ( Tigh ) ' Apollo , you can start now . ' ( Apollo ) We have 12 charges to set . ( Starbuck ) This weightlessness is really gonna slow us down . ( Apollo ) Let 's get moving . ( Starbuck ) I 'm right with you . The first one goes right over there . According to Colonel Tigh we have to work fast . That 's why we don 't have tether lines . They 'd just slow us down . Just don 't get careless . Lose your grip , you 'll be floating in space forever . Thanks for reminding us , Sheba . Colonel , any sign of Muffy yet ? ( Tigh ) ' No. I 'm sorry , Apollo . ' Of course ! Mushies ! ( Starbuck ) What do mushies have to do with explosives ? Colonel Tigh , Boxey trained Muffy to sniff out mushies ! 'Have them put them in the open duct . ' Consider it done , Apollo . Omega , order some mushies sent up here . Yes , sir . ( Growls ) ( Barks ) Colonel . The fire leader reports that the fire has crossed his defensive line at compartment 31 in both Beta and Gamma sections . Then he has no choice but to fall back to compartment 43 . Sir , the fire has spread laterally . The defensive line now extends through Delta , Alpha , and Theta section , also . Five full sections of flame and nowhere else to fall back to . ( Muffit barks ) More hose ! Release more hose ! ( Bleeping ) Finite microlaser . If that happens when you 're near the heart wall ... I know . Amplify the laser to operating mode . Get him out of there ! Hurry ! Watch your footing ! It 's slippery ! Colonel , the temperature in the energiser is critical . Solium storage is just as bad . If we can just get those charges set and blow them in time ... - Apollo , we 're running out of time . - Just another 15 centons . I don 't know if we have it . - Blow the charges we have set . - ' Negative . ' We have to blow them in exactly the calculated pattern . We must do it in time . Keep me posted . Colonel ! Look ! ( Muffit barks ) ( Tigh ) I don 't believe it . He made it . ( Boxey ) Boomer ! - How is he ? - Not good . Neither are the rest of us . Without these masks they 're not going to have a chance . I just hope he can get back in time . When the hull blows they 'll lose whatever oxygen they have . Muffy , find Boxey . Boxey . ( Barks ) Apollo , Muffy 's on his way back with the life masks . ( Apollo ) ' Thank you , sir . ' Five more centons , Colonel . If I had a choice , I 'd say no . Apollo ! Aah ! Aah . Somehow , thank you doesn 't seem like enough . Forget it . We have a lot of work to do . Just another few centons . Hurry , Apollo . A micron could make the difference . We 're setting the last one now . This charge has a magnetic base . I 'll pull myself across with it . ( Apollo ) ' There 's a handhold just up from the other side . ' Don 't worry about me , I 'll see you inside . Muffy won 't let us down , Athena . ( Barks ) Muffy ! I hear Muffy ! ( Muffit barking ) Muffy ! - lt 's the life masks . - Oh . Boxey . Here , pass them around . They 'll save us from the smoke , but the fire ? Everybody to the other side . They 're gonna blow the hull ! Over here ! Let 's go ! ( Barks ) - Muffy ! Come back ! - Boxey ! The last one 's set ! Apollo ! Starbuck , get inside ! Those explosives are going to go off any centon ! Get inside ! Colonel , I think our time has run out . Starbuck , get inside ! There 's nothing you can do ! ( Boomer ) Stay down , everyone ! Stay down ! It worked , Apollo . The fire is out ! ( Cheering ) Apollo ? Starbuck ? Something 's wrong . Sheba ? I can 't see them anywhere , Colonel . Good Lord . The explosion must 've gotten them . I refuse to believe that . 'l won 't give up . I 'm going to keep looking for them . ' Colonel Tigh . I see them. I see them ! Apollo ? Starbuck ? Hang on ! We 're sending a shuttle . - Colonel ? My family ? - They 're all safe , including your father . ( Sighs ) So am I , thanks to Starbuck . I guess I just can 't stand you going anywhere without me . I know just how you feel , Boxey . But Dr Wilker built Muffy in the first place and I 'm sure he can build another one . But it won 't really be Muffy . Yes , he will . He 'll look just like him . - He 'll be identical . - That 's not what I mean . Oh , Boxey ! ( Laughs ) Father . I told you I 'd make it through , didn 't I ? At least I think I did . I hope you recommend Boomer for a decoration . He pulled them all through . Thank you . We did have one casualty , I 'm afraid . Muffy 's never coming back , Dad . Want to bet ? ( Barking ) Muffy ! You can be real proud . He saved that firefighter 's life . Dragged him out of a burning compartment . So that 's why he ran back into the duct . I 'm glad he saved somebody but he got burned awful badly . Don 't worry . Dr Wilker will fix him up as good as before . - Are you sure ? - Positive .

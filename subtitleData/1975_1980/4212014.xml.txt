Mouth is too tiny . Narrow mouth . Legs are alright . Bosom ? She has no bosom . No bosom at all . Stop that ! You 're very rude . She has a very vivid imagination . You know , she hears things . Names ... machine guns ... God knows what . She thinks there 's a war going on . That 's not all . A little while ago she thought she saw an unicorn . Yes , I tell you . Unicorn . Of course it doesn 't exists . Anyway , it 's a very insipid animal . Oh God , she 's moving about again . Very curious . What can I do ? She ran away ... The lady upstairs ... she 's dead . But you don 't hear me . She 's very dead . No , you don 't understand . My name is Lily . I see . Lily is your name too . Funny . You spell it differently . Who is he ? I 'm sorry . Your sister . Yes , of course . Your sister Lily . But your mother is dead . She passed away , I tell you . She is dead ! And I want you to know that it was not my fault ! Let me out ! Open the door ! Open it ! You ! It 's all your fault ! I 'm not gonna stay on top here for very long . Do you understand ? If you think that you can keep me here forever , you 're wrong ! Let me get out right away !

Mighty death . - Magical . - Magical death ... threatening my life . - How could my love die ... How could the endlessly living perish ? Yearning eternal blindness , where forever love and rapture await . Heart on heart . Mouth on mouth . All is illusion . Set us free of this world . Dream of fire endless promise . Our hearts wonder wish , As full death , men named it evermore , beautiful delusion . Sweet awaited desire . Never waking . Never fearing , nameless there . Each to each , belonging . With love alone , all life source . Would you please tell me what 's going on around here ? What ? They 've taken the city . Oh wooden horse , my God . And Brian ? Brian is dead you say ? What about Helen ? Hello ? Hello ? That radio gotta be fixed . The girl . She just lost her bloomers and now she 's eating the cheese . Of course , there was Christmas cheese . I know what you think about . I don 't like it . She 'll find out about the greeks . Come here dear ! Come , come , my little one . I 'll explain everything to you now .

She 's trying to open it , she 's kicking it . Now she 's coming back , the little ... She just fell ... Now she 's off the window ... Have you seen a unicorn ? Have you seen a unicorn ? Have you seen a unicorn ? Where is that unicorn ? Answer me ! Out , out , brief candle . Life 's but a walking shadow . Stupid , stupid tree . Did you say something ? I said you 're mean . What do you mean ' mean ' ? Why are you keep running after me ? I find it rather tedious . What is it you want exactly ? I don 't know really , but I 'm not mean . You 're not ? What about those poor children ... I just saw you beating up ? - I 'm not ... - Shut up , let me speak ! I saw how you kick that tree ... and trampled those innocent flowers to death . And you dare to say you 're not mean ? You should practice what you preach ! You 're eating the flowers . Suppose we change the subject ? I don 't mean to be rude , but you 're not very graceful . In my books , unicorns are slim and white . The most beautiful things in the world are the most useless . Peacocks and lillies , for instance . You know , the old lady upstairs . She doesn 't want me to see you . Oh Lord , you mean that babbling-beady-on-the-while upstairs . Don 't pay any attention to her . She 's not even real . What do you mean she 's not real ? I touched her , I spoked her , I even saw her die . I mean what I mean . Little one , I could give you some precious information ... concerning that old hag . Lunatic driving baddie . I 'm leaving right away . And I won 't be back in 154 years . Hey , come back ! I like talking to you . Nobody talks to me here . Humphrey . What 's the matter ? What 's the matter now ? Who 's Humphrey ? - You mean the rat ? - Yes , I mean the rat . Did you had a fight ? Yes , but that 's nothing new . He 's so opinionated and stubborn . I love him , you understand my sweet thing ? We went in so many roads together . So many seasons I 've seen us passed . So many hopes ... I see the waves in the ocean . Hungry , hungry . Just a minute , please . Just a minute . I 'm afraid I don 't have much milk . Hey ! Your friend is back . Willy boy , Willy boy , Where are you going ? I 'll go with you , if I may . I 'm going to the meadow to see them ... I 'm going to help them make the hay . I 'm going to help them fill the barn , with summer hay to lay upon . Nobody home No bread , no drink , no money how we none yet we shall be bliss . Nobody home . No bread , no drink , no money how we none . yet we shall be bliss . Hello ? Can you hear me ? Hello ? Is nobody 's there ? Hello ? Can you hear me ? Anybody hear me ? Just a minute , please .

 I don 't think I can go on . I know you can 't . You need that girl . - Supposing she won 't come ? - She must be made to come . No ! Have you any choice ? - No . - She is a doctor . Once she is here , she 'll understand . Well , she mustn 't be harmed . If she is harmed , she wouldn 't be any use to us , would she ? So be it . Whoa ! Whoa ! Who are you ? Greg ? - Is this Whitecross ? - Yes . Yes , it is . - GREG : Are you well ? - Yes , we are very well . And you ? Yeah , we 're fine . And where are you from ? Derring farm , near Evesham . - GREG : And how many of you are there ? - Just the two of us . No , I mean at the farm . Oh ! Not many . Twelve . We 've been there since the summer . We tried to find you at the Grange place but it was burnt down . Yes , that 's right . We saw your notice there saying that you 'd come on here . - You mean you were looking for us ? - Yes , that 's right . We were told how to get to the Grange so that we could find you . - Your name wouldn 't be Greg , would it ? - Yes . Ah ! Then we have some regards to give you , Greg , from a lady called Abby Grant . - What ? - No , please . Better to keep apart . We 're well , but others of us are not . Yes , you 're right . Well , where are they ? - Did she find Peter ? - Oh , yes . Yes , she did . He is with her . She found him ? Never give up , Greg . But where are they ? - They 're at Derring . - But they 're ill . - She said you had a doctor here . Ruth . - Yes , that 's right . - Have you still got that doctor ? - Yes , she is here . Well , what 's wrong with them ? It sounds like a kind of toxemia . Blood poisoning . I won 't know till I get there . How long do they say they 've been at this place ? Well , since the summer . Abby must have been on her way back . No , there 's something about it I don 't like . What ? GREG : I don 't know . Can 't put my finger on it . - Do you want to take a look ? - Oh , I 'd like to see Abby again . - Oh , yes ! - No . They 've probably got an epidemic . Stay away . It 's a very good point . They were being very careful . - And what about Ruth ? - I don 't have much choice , do I ? Well , I don 't know . I still don 't like it . I mean , why haven 't we heard of these people before ? ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Well , we 'll get your exact route from you as usual . Can we have a route from you ? Which road are you taking ? Yes , most certainly . The B4219 till it hits the A38 , then the A40 and the A44 to Evesham . Just before Evesham , there is a hill and a bridge . You take a little track to the left , and the third branch , the middle branch of three , and that 's us . It 'll take you through the town of Pershore , won 't it ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's right . - Did you actually got through Pershore ? - Yes . What about infection ? Oh , no . We skirted around it . We didn 't go through it . No , of course not . A little to the south . Well , what about Abby ? Before she became ill . Was she still her plumb little self ? - ( CHUCKLING ) You 're checking on us now . - I think they are . Abby is tall and slim . She is younger than me . She had her hair all cut short . It 's growing now . Okay . Pass . Is there nothing you want ? Oh , no , thank you , no . We got food and drink and a stove and things like that . We should be there before night . - All right then , was it ? The cart . - Stay away from us , please . The cart all right ? It 's a good horse that , too . My best one . I am Ruth , the doctor ... Hey , no ! No , don 't go near him . - Where are they ? - Who ? The people who are ill . Abby is not here . What 's going on ? I 'm afraid we had to practise a little deception . - Where 's Abby ? - London . Just the four lads here . There 's nothing wrong with them . London ? Look , we keep our distance from people we meet . From him , from your friends . So as not to touch them with what we bring from London . But you 're contaminated now , being with us . You can 't go back to your friends . You will kill them . - Contaminated with what ? - We don 't know . We call it the London Sickness . And you two have it ? We don 't know . What are the symptoms ? You feel very tired and sort of paralysed with it . Then you need treatment . We 're pushing our luck coming out as far as this . Yeah , but we 've got a hospital in London . We got doctors , X-rays , the lot . And we wanna get back there . All right , yes , there is a lot of disease in London , but we 're all right there . We 're well looked after . You 've got a doctor , why do you need me ? Well , Abby sent for you . She told us where you were , she asked us to come and get you . She wants you . She said that you would come . - You said she was ill . - Yeah . - And her son ? - Yes . What 's wrong with them ? Look , love , you really don 't have the choice . - You have petrol ? - Yeah . Heaps . They gave me 10 gallons and a thousand cigarettes . Well , for the lads , like . And matches . - And make-up ? - Yeah . And a hospital . - Soap ? - Yes . Soap , balm , we 've got everything . We 've got electric light . I think we should be off . It is urgent . I 'm not coming . - Please . - Abby must take her chance . You have a doctor . My friends need me . Not only them , there are other settlements . In London , they need you more . You 've got to come . I haven 't got to come and you can 't make me . Please . You know we can , but don 't force us to . It will be very unpleasant . What about you ? Are you going to standby and let them do this ? Don 't know what you 're on about . Us lot probably won 't be far behind you once we get the car going . Things are great there by the sound of it . - What about my friends ? - Oh , that 'll be taken care of , duckie . He 's ... He 's gonna send someone . - I wonder . - One of the lads . I 'm sending him . - Disinfect the cart . - Yeah , all right . - Use all I gave you . - Okay . Don 't worry . We need you . A lot of people need you . You must feel terrible . Look , I 'm sorry . Please don 't be scared . It 's just that we couldn 't very well walk up to you in your settlement and say , " Come to London , will you ? " No , you would have just said no . - Would I ? - Well , wouldn 't you ? That 's why we pretended we came from that place . You said a lot of people . How many ? We 've been told to say nothing until you see for yourself . JENNY : Greg ? - Oh , thank you . - You must be frozen . How long would it take us to get to Derring farm ? Well , if you left early enough , I suppose you can get there and back in a day . I 'd love to see Abby again . Well , I don 't think it would be wise just yet . Not if there 's sickness there . You gotta think of Paul . Oh , so have you . Anyway , I don 't mean now . All the same , I 'd like to take a ride over there . Greg . ( RUTH SNIFFING ) Don 't worry about that smell . It 's London . Funny thing about that smell , in a few hours you won 't even notice it . Cigarette , please . - Have one . - No . Go on , it helps ! - What are they for ? - Rats . You better get your gear together now . We 're not gonna have a chance once we get out . - Rats , with those things ? - The noise helps to keep them off . I can 't get this thing any closer . ( RATS SCREECHING ) Look out ! ( GUN FIRING ) From now on we have to keep our eyes open . They go in packs . If you meet one of them on its own , that means it 's dying . But it is just as dangerous . Please come . RUTH : What are those fires ? To be scientific , they 're started by spontaneous combustion . Heaps of bodies . Or heaps of something . I don 't know . ( THUD ) Shh . ( THUD ) Who 's there ? You won 't get rid of me . I 'll get back . You 'll see . I 'll get back . Put your things on here . Right . ( WATER PATTERING ) We 're going south now , under the river . It 's messy , but the big danger is flooding . Yeah . I never did like going under the river . Come on now . ( GRUNTING ) That 's our petrol supply coming in . Hello , Benji . ( MEN CHATTERING ) - Hello . - Hello . - Hello . - You all right ? - Hi there . You all right ? - Yes . This way , please . ( ALARM RINGING ) - More rats ? - Yes . We go up this way now . When we go out , stay in the light . It keeps the rats away . ( ALARM CONTINUES RINGING ) - Hello , Penny . - Hi , George . - Oh ! - Amul . Just a minute . Yeah , turn it off . They 're in now . Well , meet the new doctor . This is George . I 'm glad you 're here . I 'll just check you didn 't bring anything in with you . Yeah . Okay . ( UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) - What 's that ? - Oh , films . We like family shows mostly . Hey , what 's on ? - Laurel and Hardy . - Oh . - See you . - Yes . - Come on . - Now , look ! There 's someone here who will answer all your questions . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Come in ! - Hello , Manny . - Penny , you 're back . - You made it . - Yeah . Yeah , we 're back . Hello , Doctor . Well , I 'm sorry they had to bring you like this . Put your gear down and shake hands . I 'm Manny . I know you 're Ruth . Look , come on , love , you 're here . Welcome . - All right , Amul ? - All right , Manny . Thank you . - Everybody is very grateful to you . - That 's all right . - I 'll clean up now . See you later . - Okay , great . - How was it ? - Well , not bad . They risked their lives to bring you here . - Bring me where ? - Haven 't you told her ? - No . - Right , hang on . Hello , Manny . Yup ! Yup ! She is here . All in one piece . Well , bit shell-shocked . Yeah . Yeah , they had to . You coming over ? Oh ! I 'm sorry . No , no , no . No , that 's all right . I understand . Yup . Yeah , that 's okay . Okay , see you . This is what you might call my private exchange . It doesn 't go very far . Just around the house . The radio goes further . Well , come on . Grub up in five minutes . Ruth . Oh , come on , love . - How was the tunnel ? - How do I answer that ? - Well ... Well , what I mean is ... - It was dry . Good . If it had been wet , you wouldn 't have got through . The river would have all slopped over . We were waiting for that to happen . Here , have a cigarette . - Oh , thanks . - You 'd have to come around a long way . Where 's Abby ? Well , I wish I knew . I thought she was a nice girl . A bit bossy , but I liked her . - You told me she was here . - Well , she was , Ruth . Honestly . She was standing right where you are now . I remember when she first come here . - She was looking for her son , Peter . - I was told she 'd found him . Well , I had to play that by ear , didn 't I ? All she cared about was that boy of hers . We tried to stop her leaving , she wouldn 't listen to reason . Just off . Just like that . I mean , I was very sorry . She 'd have been useful here . - When did she go ? - MANNY : About a month ago . She won 't have lasted long . - You abducted me . - I 'm sorry . - We had no choice . - I had my orders ... Get me out of here . Please . Please , Ruth , don 't think too badly of us . Come on through . Come on . Oh , come on , Ruth . Come on . Well now , what have we got here ? Cor ! Roast duck . Well , I wonder where that came from . Buckingham Palace Gardens or the Serpentine ? Well , it 'll make a change from pigeons . And sprouts . Wintergreens . Come on , Ruth , please . Be my guest . Hot water , Ruth , and soap . I 'll tell you what . I 'll play you a tape that Mac picked up on his radio . Mac 's our radio expert . - You mean a broadcast from outside ? - Yeah . Mac 's been trying for a year . This is the first time he 's got anything . Come and listen . - Listen to this . - MAN ON RADIO : If you hear me , come to Zamalek in Cairo . Come to Zamalek in Cairo . There are only 12 people here . The people have food and fuel . Come to Zamalek in Cairo . - That 's it . - When was that broadcast ? About six weeks ago . Mac tried to call them back but he reckoned they didn 't know about the set . This guy called everyday for four days , then nothing . Here , Ruth . Good girl . - Why have you brought me here ? - Look , Manny ... All right , all right , all right , all right ! I 'm sorry . That extra place was set for the doctor . He was going to eat with us and answer all your questions . Now , he can 't be here because when I called him just now , he got an emergency . Take me to him . - All right , love . - Come on . Nessie . Nessie , this is Ruth . NESSIE : Come in , come in , Doctor . I 'm the matron , assistant surgeon , anaesthetist and general factotum . My name 's Nessie . We 're not aseptic in here . How do you do ? How do you do ? Yes that 's his lordship there , the doctor . I 'm very glad you 're here . Come and have a look at this . - You didn 't qualify ? - No . I did four and half years . That 's fair enough . This man has what we call the London Sickness . The first cases were about two months ago . Rapid onset , slight fever . When he 's conscious , sharp-witted and acute fatigue in all his muscles . I don 't know what it is . It 's years since I did any medicine , proper medicine , I mean . I was a health officer . But here we are . Come and sit down , please . I heard about you from Abby Grant . My dear , I knew that if I could just talk to you , I could persuade you to help me . So , I 'm afraid I had you brought here . I 'm really sorry about it . Please forgive me but I had to do . Now , may I fill the background in for you ? Yes , please . Well , about a year ago , when the plague struck us , I seemed to be the only doctor left in London . - I met Manny . You 've met him . - Yes . Well , he managed to keep a couple of generators going and built up an organisation . With some help from the doctor . Yes , Nessie , we were in it together . Then Nessie came along and propped us up . - He 's waking , Doctor . - Ah ! Come . Hello , Mac . How are you ? This is Ruth , another doctor . Say hello . He knows what 's going on . Don 't you ? Are you the radio engineer ? - I heard a tape of yours . - That 's right . Can we do a little test , Mac ? Can you blink five times ? Thanks , Mac . We 're going to get you well . We need you . God knows we need everyone . - Would you mind explaining to me ... - How is your biochemistry ? What 's weariness caused by ? - Lactic acid in the tissues . - Not being properly degraded . Hmm . - Have you come across this ? - No . And it seems to be a peculiar to London . The London Sickness . Our main work here is medicine , not surgery . Except for emergency and orthopaedic . We don 't have a blood bank but we do have radiography . - How many ? - Londoners ? There were about a thousand . Lot of them are ill with typhoid , a dysentery sort of thing . Then the number fell right down to about 500 . Alarming but it 's fairly stable now . We have as many births as deaths . Five hundred Londoners we are . Manny must have told you that we forage . Yes . I suppose you can get just about anything . Well , we 've no blood or serum . We have some fresh food and vegetables . - A high sickness rate . - How high ? Ten percent . Fifty patients in various stages . Cuts and scratches go septic . There seems to be a general poison in the atmosphere , so we pump everybody full of antibiotics . - How is he ? - Going . We don 't know about the London Sickness . Mac . Mac ! Poor fella . I 'll do the autopsy but I shan 't find anything . I don 't know what to look for . - When did he get ill ? - Three days ago . You see , Ruth , as a statistician , I know that our 500 souls have about 100 breeding pairs , right ? Yes . About 100 couples who can have children , and that 's the lower limit for the human race . If we sink below that , we have a fair chance of extinction in a few generations . Like your settlements . They won 't survive , they 're too small . London is about the only place on Earth where so many people would be together still after the sickness . Well , maybe Tokyo , New York , - but we haven 't from them . - We heard from Cairo . Twelve . If you want my opinion , I don 't think there 's any chance of lasting out here . That 's from what I 've seen . Nessie ? Nessie ! He hasn 't got the sickness . He 's just weary . - He 's all right . - What ? Oh , sorry . Will you do the surgery tonight , Doctor ? - Me ? - No , she won 't . Ruth has a decision to make . We forced her to come here . I 'd like you to have a peaceful night , Ruth , and consider it . - Consider what ? - Oh , consider it right . I 'll do the rounds . We 've quite a bit of equipment here . Two trained nurses and Nessie . Some children who 've done science at O-Level . We 're trying to teach them . We need to start a medical school . I 'll get someone to show you your room . Sorry . Was I staring ? Did I say welcome ? Oh , yes . Well , here you are , then . They gave it a lick of paint for you and I had a go at those curtains meself . We 'll have some supper sent in for you in a minute . Well , Ruth , I hope you 'll be comfortable . Can you give me a few minutes before supper ? Yeah , sure . ( UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ) Hello ! Anyone here ? MAN : Hello . You wait there , I 'll come to you . - Right , then . - It 's all right , I 'm quite well . That 's as may be . Who are you ? What do you want ? My name is Greg . I 'm looking for a woman called Abby . - Abby Grant . - Who ? - This is Derring farm , isn 't it ? - Yeah . I 'm looking for a woman and her son . Abby and Peter . They 're both ill . No one like that here . Well , there is a settlement here . - ( LAUGHING ) What ? - Some people . Just the four lads and me . - Well , what about Ruth ? - Who ? Look , a man and a woman came from here looking for a doctor . Now , where are they ? The man was Indian . Oh , them . Well , they didn 't stop . They went on . - Well , they went on where ? - London . - What ? - In a car , Range Rover . They borrowed my horse and cart . Don 't know why . Said I got to disinfect it . Daft . Well , did they leave a route ? Did they say which roads they were taking ? Oh , you mean one of them maps . Yeah , they gave us some . You know , for when we go . Do you want one ? They said to give them out . - Could you get me one ? - Yeah . Wait ! Just a minute ! Ruth , the younger one , didn 't she leave a message to get in touch with her friends ? - No . - Nothing ? I cross my heart . Could you get me one of those maps ? As quickly as you can . ( COW MOOING ) ON RADIO : This is Manny from the Centre . I got a bit of sad news about poor old Mac . His troubles are over . And we 're gonna miss him at radio . Still , an enormous good wish for us all whatever we 're doing today , young and old . That 's all . Call you in an hour . All right ? RUTH : Just a minute . Good morning , Doctor . Did you sleep well ? Yes . - This is the Oval , isn 't it ? - Yes , the Oval cricket ground . - Were you a keen follower of cricket ? - No . Well , I saw two matches here . One was Surrey against Nottinghamshire and the other was the last test match . I wasn 't a keen follower . Some of them were . Well , as you see , we have here eggs , milk , and we 're going to have our own vegetables and some corn I believe . How do you keep the rats out ? Electric fence . And we are very , very careful . NESSIE ON RADIO : Is Dr Ruth anywhere ? That 's you . The doctor is here . NESSIE : Could you come to surgery as soon as convenient ? Okay . - Yes ? - Good morning . - Where 's the doctor ? - He 's having a sleep . He was up most of the night . Well , have you come to a decision ? How can I come to a decision ? It 's being forced on me the same as coming here was forced on me . I see . While you 're making up your mind , Doctor , will you be so kind as to help in one or two cases ? If I can . Good morning , everybody . And how are we all this morning ? I 've brought you a new doctor . Doctor Ruth . She 's come to have a look at us . So we 'll have no more grumbles , will we ? Well , Kevin , my lad . And how did you sleep ? Did you take your breakfast ? Sit up a wee bit . - RUTH : Hello , what 's your name ? - Maisie . - What are you here for , then ? - I don 't know . - You 've been having toothache . - Have I ? It says here they took out a tooth . Open . - Back one . Was it a big one ? - Yeah . - And you 're taking your pills ? - Yup . You think it was your big , black tooth that gave you the tummy ache ? Yeah . You don 't have any fever . - I think you can get up today and help . - All right . ON RADIO : Hello everyone , this is Manny . Just to say we 're gonna have a funeral for Mac this afternoon . After the Doc 's done his report . Amul 's gonna take over the radio . He 's been reading it up . I 'm going out now to have a look at the coal situation at Battersea because we 're gonna run low soon . I 'll tell you tonight if I 've had any luck . TTFN . Doctor ? Hello , Doctor . My name 's Barbara . - Hello , Barbara . How are you ? - Well , I need to be up and about . Well , you mustn 't rush things . How 's the cut ? It wasn 't a cut , it was just a scrape . One can 't do anything here when it goes bad . - You still have some fever . - I have to get back to work . - Well , how long shall I be here ? - Until everything is behaving itself . There 's no point getting up before then . May I explain , please ? I 'm the planner for all these people . I was in the civil service before , so I know a bit about logistics . I thought Manny did all the planning . Well , he does the day-to-day but I 'm planning the big move . - The big move ? - The one you 're here for . We can 't do the move without a doctor at either end . - Oh , yes , of course . - That 's why I have to be working . Well , moving 500 people is a big logistical problem . And the doctor wouldn 't be content with anything less than 500 . He says it 's the minimum needed for the human species to survive . Yes . The only trouble is , I don 't really know enough about the other end . - The other end ? - The Isle of Wight . Oh yes , of course . I don 't know much clearance is involved and what the fuel and power situation is . I mean , it 's always been at least a two year plan to get the agriculture going and the life support systems . And , frankly , I don 't see how it can be done any quicker . But at least I can make sure that the lines of communication work . And now that you 're here , he can send out an advance party . Yes . I think we should go cross-country from here on . It will take longer . It will take even longer if one of those throws a shoe . Anyway , we don 't know what we 're gonna meet in London . Might have to move in a hurry . All right . Now , which way do you want to go ? - Well , can you see any water there ? - What , running water ? Yeah , there 's river Kennet . We could water the horses there and then follow it down as far as Reading . Yes . All right , good . We 'll have some grub at the river . With any luck , we 'll be in London by nightfall . There 's someone behind us . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Watch it . Come on , Wally . You 're in the wrong place . - Move . - Where to ? Come on , start walking . - I can 't live out here . - Hard luck ! Get moving . You 've been voted out , remember ? You should have behaved yourself . You 've been naughty . Naughty boys get sent outside . Now , go on . Get back to the rats . Start walking . Cor ! - What a rotten day . - No coal ? It 's all under the river . We can 't get near it . We 'll just have to look for some other dumps . Who 's available ? Do you know ? Oh , and get me Barbara . Barbara 's still in the ward . I thought she was supposed to be back on the job . - Has she had a relapse ? - No . I 'll kill that Nessie . She 's kept Barbara off just to spite me . Just because I went straight to the Doc . She 's power mad . All right , where 's Barbara ? I said , where 's Barbara ? Good evening , Emmanuel . Had a good day ? Now , you listen to me , you wizened old woman . Wise old woman , please . I thought Barbara was supposed to be back on the job . Was she ? You know the Doc agreed this morning . Now which doctor do you mean ? Do you mean to tell me that Ruth countermanded what the Doc said ? Oh , look , Nessie , I got to have Barbara back on the job . I 've got to get that coal organised or we 'll all freeze to death . And I 've got to get it ... Hello , Barbara . - Out of bed , Barbara , and dressed ? - I 'm all right , really . You mean you 're discharging yourself . That 's strictly against the rules . - I know . - Dr Ruth said you need peace and equilibrium to clear your tummy up . I 'm going down to the office . Don 't stop me . Well , that 's all right , then . You all right ? - What do you mean ? - You 're looking pale . And were you limping when you came in ? Me ? No . You 're not getting your evil hands on me , Nessie . I 'm fine . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Yes ? Don 't get up . I just came to say Barbara has discharged herself . Oh . Oh , well , that will be all right . I was just playing safe . Yes , I know . Maybe for the next week or two , you could bring me into these decisions . Yes , of course . That is if you 're staying . Or are you just gradually slipping into the job rather than making your mind up ? - It 's the same thing . - If you say so , Doctor . I would like to know because you 're lying there - and the Doctor 's only mortal , you know . - I 'm sorry . I mean , go if you want . And spoil the big move ? You weren 't supposed to know about that . Who told you ? - Manny ? - No . Why wasn 't I supposed to know ? - The Doctor has his reasons . - Yes . Like not wanting me to know that I 'm earmarked for the advance party . Whether you go or not is entirely up to you . You know very well I can 't get out of London on my own . - Your friend Abby Grant did . - How do you know ? Most of them come back sick but she didn 't . That 's probably because she 's dead . God ! Look at that fire . Don 't they know coal 's hard to come by . ( DOCTOR GRUNTING ) - Oh , I 'm sorry , Doc . I didn 't see you . - Oh . Oh , I 've slept for two hours . Marvellous . - Good . - I crept in here and your warmth and comfort were too much . - I 'll put the light out . - No , no , no . I wouldn 't mind a cup of tea . Nessie 's doing the wards . Ruth 's on surgery . - How is she ? Ruth . - Oh , give her time . Her medicine 's better than mine but her surgery is a bit tentative . Can 't really afford to be tentative in surgery . Well , you don 't get too much of that , surgery . Not yet . Well , I 'm glad you persuaded her to stay . You 're looking more rested already . - I haven 't . - What ? - Persuaded her to stay . - Well , she 's got to . Can 't force her to stay . - You wanna bet ? - She 's a doctor . And as such she won 't be any use to us unless she 's free to make her own choice . God , it better work after that . ( LAUGHING ) Now , this is Hanwell . Where are we ? Where do we go ? It says follow line eastwards to Ealing Broadway . Through subway for tickets ? Through subway for tickets . ( RAT SCREECHING ) ( CHARLES SCREAMING ) Greg ! For God 's sake ! ( RATS SCREECHING ) Greg !

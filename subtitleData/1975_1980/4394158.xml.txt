 ( Men talking and laughing ) Excuse me , sir . Group sent me here , sir . I 've got one more op to complete and then I go home . And he did say , sir - Group said - that as your flight is one man short and all my team have bought it , that you 'd ... All right , sir . Sorry , sir . ( Chatter and laughter continues ) ( Chatter fades ) ( Man whistling Pack Up Your Troubles In Your Old Kitbag ) ( Whistling continues ) ( Whistling continues , echoing ) 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' ( Whistling continues ) - It 's up there . - Yes . - How 's Sapphire ? - She 's still asleep . - Are you going up there ? - Yes . - It 's almost like an invitation . - What ? - Each time he starts to whistle . - Yes . I 'd like to say that ... with the seance and what happened afterwards ... I could have been wrong , about some things , that is , it was that darkness . Even the spirit of the schoolteacher warned us . Yes . Yes , she did . But I knew the moment the darkness appeared we were dealing with something evil . Even the crucifix trembled . And there he is up there inviting us once again . - But things are different now . - Hmm ? - We know his name . - Oh , yes . You go back to the waiting room . Take care of Sapphire . - But what about the darkness ? - It 's gone . - But it could reappear . - It could . - That 's why I got this . - Thank you . Take care of Sapphire . All right . ( Whistling continues ) Sammy ? Sam ? Sam Pearce . - That 's your name , isn 't it ? - ( Overlapping voices ) We know it is so there 's no need for you to hide in the darkness . ( Voices fade ) We don 't have to hide . That 's our privilege . The privilege of the living . ( Sapphire ) Steel . ( Voices resume and fade ) Tully . - Yes ? - Is Sapphire still with you ? - Of course she is . - Check again . - Check again ? - Look ! Yes , she 's still here , still asleep . ( Man whistling It 's A Long Way To Tipperary ) ( Wind blowing ) ( Explosions ) ( Whistling continues ) What 's the matter ? What is it ? You said something earlier on about the subconscious . The fact that it could be somewhere else . Yes , between journeys . Either that or the seance has had an exhausting effect on her - she was sent back a long way . - You were right . - Hmm ? - I saw Sapphire on the platform . - Sorry , I don 't understand . I 've seen Sapphire out there on the platform with Pearce and the others . And it was as if ... Sapphire was one of them . This subconscious , can it be seen ? - You mean a human shape ? - Yes ! I don 't think so . Otherwise it couldn 't be termed the subconscious . All right , Mr Tully , would you say it 's possible to have ghosts of the living ? No ! Would you ? There are theories about visual fallacies but ... - The seance hadn 't quite finished . - No . - I broke the circle . - Yes , and here 's the result . I 'm gonna try and take a close look at the other one . Don 't worry , I 'll look after her . I realise how important she is to you . - I 'll try talking to her . - What ? Many medical practitioners believe that talking to a patient who 's comatose can prove therapeutic , even curative . That 's a good idea . You do that . Sapphire . Sapphire . It 's no good , Pearce . No good . You 're still late , you see . Over 60 years too late . - Oh , I wouldn 't say that . - I would . Your war 's finished . It finished a long time ago . A bit different to yours , then . Yours has just begun . You left me here , Steel . This is where you left me . - We didn 't exactly leave you ... - Right here . Now I suppose I 'm as much a part of the station as he is . No . Not sure of me ? You can 't exactly do a spot analysis , can you ? It 's not your territory . Why shouldn 't I be sure of you ? It 's not in your nature to be sure of anything . - But I know you 're Sapphire . - Oh ? Well , there 's only one of you , isn 't there ? - Yes . - Well , then . - Where 's Pearce gone ? - How should I know ? You said you 're as much a part of the station as he is . - I thought you 'd know . - Well , I expect he 's busy . - Busy ? - Busy waiting . - What for ? - For others , of course . - Others like him ? - Yes . Like the pilot and the men from the submarine ? - Yes . - How many others ? - What ? - How many others is he expecting ? I don 't know . - One ? Five ? Ten ? - I said I don 't know . A thousand ? I mean , there must be a lot of applicants , surely . Anyway , since you left me , since you abandoned me , I 've had time to think . - Oh , yes ? - And realise ... Realise what ? That we shouldn 't be here on this particular assignment . No ? Our information was false . Our briefing was wrong . Those after-images are harmless . - Harmless ? - Yes ! And they 'll be gone soon . So why don 't we leave them in peace ? All right . Let 's leave them in peace , shall we ? Come on . I haven 't finished talking yet . Oh . Sorry . I suppose my interest in the supernatural started early . When I was at school , I suppose . Yes , I think it was when I was at school . It started as a game but I soon realised that it was something more . When the others have arrived , they 'll leave . - To go where ? - I don 't know . - Back where they came from ? - I don 't know but they will leave . ( Darkness whispering ) Steel . Would you mind looking at me when I 'm talking to you ? ( Whispering continues ) After all , there 's no one else here . Only us . I spent a great deal of time as a lad ... going to churches and places like that . My hobby in those days was brass rubbing . Other lads of my age were involved in sporting activities but not me . ( Whispering intensifies ) - Tell me what happened . - Happened ? - You say you want to talk . - I do . Then tell me what happened when you were left behind . Well , I suppose I was given the chance to understand . To understand Pearce and his friends ? - Yes . - And to sympathise with them ? To an extent , yes . - And to find them harmless ? - Yes . I 've always allowed myself to have an open mind . To believe that one can accept something without having to understand it is the first essential before any man can have a supernatural or religious experience . A mind that is closed cannot be receptive . ( Whispering continues , intense ) - What about the power ? - What power ? - The darkness , remember ? - Oh , yes . - Is it also harmless ? - Yes . - We were wrong about that as well ? - Yes . So it was fortunate that I was left behind . Why fortunate ? Because of what I 've learnt , the truth . Steel , aren 't you pleased with me ? What ? Yes . You might at least show it , at least congratulate me . - All right , I congratulate you . - Thank you , Steel . I 'll just go and fetch Mr Tully , shall I ? I 'm sure he 'd like to congratulate you too . There 's no need to fetch Tully . He will be here . - He will be with us soon . - ( Whispering continues ) I 've often felt that I was the wrong age for psychical achievements . A friend of mine once told me that cats , children and old people have the best results . ( Whispering ) Perhaps that 's because they have the time to be patient , - time to be tolerant . - ( Whispering continues ) So , in a way , I 'm looking forward to reaching 70 , even getting into my 80s if it means I should find success . - Don 't you think so , Steel ? - Yes . As soon as Mr Tully arrives , we 'll pack up and leave . I thought you 'd agree . We have such a fine working relationship , don 't we ? - Yes . - One of the best , right ? - Because we know each other so well . - Of course . And can anticipate each other 's thoughts . Exactly . So there 's no real need to even ask each other questions . Even though there 's one question that keeps nagging inside the head . Like the one that 's inside my head right now , the one that 's crying out for an answer . Well , perhaps it doesn 't need an answer . Oh , but it does . Ask it . Ask your question . If you 're the Sapphire that I 've grown to know ... and to love ... ( Darkness whispering ) ... who is that person ? What person ? That person in the waiting room with Tully . I suppose I 'd be quite prepared to go on until I was about ... Oh , my God ... Steel ! ( Whispering continues , intense ) Lighten our darkness , oh Lord , and by Thy mercy defend us from all perils . I couldn 't get out of the plane . - It 's my kid 's birthday tomorrow . - Who will look after the garden ? I said your war had just begun . By Thy mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night . Lighten our darkness ... ( Gunfire , Steel screaming ) ( Tully , muttering ) Lighten our darkness , oh Lord ... Oh , please , leave us alone , I beg you . Wake up , wake up ! You must wake up . We haven 't harmed you , I haven 't harmed you . Oh , please , please let us go . L-I promise ... I promise that I 'll leave . L-l-I 'll go now , I promise that . L-I 'll leave ... I 'll leave you in peace . Oh , thank you ! I 'm sorry , l-I didn 't understand . L-I 'm sorry ... Just me , you ... You mean ... Just me ? Sapphire ! I 'll get help , Sapphire . I will , I 'll get help . ( Whispering rises and fades ) Steel . Steel ! Steel ? Steel ... They said I could leave , Steel . They ... Th-They said I could go ... a-and I 'm going but d-don 't worry ... I 'll-I 'll get help , I 'll ... I 'll send back help . ( Whispering rising and fading ) ( Whispering stops ) ( Men talking and laughing ) Excuse me , I need one op . Er , just the one then I 'm off home on leave . I don 't mind what I fly . I 'll go tail-end Charlie , it makes no difference to me , and I know you fellas are flying two short , so ... really , can 't any of you use me ? Please . Excuse me , sir ... ( Whispering resumes ) ( Bell tolls ) ( Rifle cocks ) I 've been allowed to leave . - Have you now ? - Yes . Reckon you 'd better leave , then . But this seems the only exit point . That 's right , over the bridge . Yes ... I noticed just now that ... there were others down on the platform . - Who are they ? - Just others . Oh . When I first came here two months ago I said that I was your friend . I still am . I said then that I wanted to help you and I still do . My dear boy , whatever it is that has this shameful hold on you ... ( Darkness whispering ) Down here ? ( Whispering intensifies ) ( Machine-gun fire and explosions ) There 'll be a detail out here before dawn - wire detail . Might find you ... or what 's left of you after the next barrage . Then again , they may not come . I mean , you can 't blame them . Even the stretcher-bearers won 't come out here . ( Shell whistling ) ( Explosion ) ( Gunfire continues ) Sammy ... Pearce . Private S Pearce . You should have left us alone . We were causing no harm . We just wanted what was owed to us . ( Man ) Pearce , come on ! You asked me once , remember ? You asked me to sit and talk with you . Well , I 've sat and I 've talked . On my terms for a change and not yours . It 's gonna be a favourable winter . It 'll slip into spring like they was one and the same . And then it 'll be Eastertide . Anyway , you 'll be leaving us soon . You 've got no choice .

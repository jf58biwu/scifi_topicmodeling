 ( Helena ) ' Moonbase Alpha status report , '2,308 days after leaving Earth . Dr Helena Russell recording . ' We 're travelling through an area of deep space which we have named the Peace Zone . No nearby stars , no space storms , no possible dangers of any kind . All should be well on Alpha , but it isn 't . We 're troubled by sporadic disturbances and petty irritations . One of these irritations has to do with the matter of discipline . Medical technician , Sally Martin , has repeatedly failed to complete her stores inventory . As a result , she 's been ordered to complete this work during her recreation period . 3.25 grams . And Dr Helena Russell is a hard-hearted witch . Erase that . ( Wind blowing ) ( Screaming ) ( Woman ) 'You killed me , John Koenig . 'You left me to die . 'You killed me ... 'You killed me . ( Buzzer ) Yes , Helena ? John , come to Medical immediately . We have a casualty . Be right there . What kind of force did that to her ? The same kind that did this . - It 's not a laser cut . - No , it 's too jagged . - Must 've been ripped out . - Did you check perimeter defences ? Yeah . Nothing broke in or left . Something got in ! May still be here . What killed her ? You might have an idea . Not at this stage . I have to conduct an autopsy . Why don 't you ? Tony , I want a complete dossier on the girl . - Get it to me as soon as you can . - Yes , sir ( ! ) ( Interference and bleeping ) I don 't know . It just doesn 't make sense . - Still getting malfunctions ? - Minor bugs , false signals , ghosts . Just get rid of those bugs , OK ? - Commander ? - Yeah ? I think I may have found our problem . ( Koenig ) What is it ? Some sort of space phenomenon . I 'm not sure what . ( Maya ) It 's filled with ... electrically-charged particles . Is that the best you can do ? They seem to be affecting our sensors . All the sensors ? No , but I assume we 'll get more malfunctions as we get closer . It 's pulsing at a fairly low level . - It 's too slight to harm anyone . - Another assumption ? I can only go by my instruments . I assume they are less fallible in their read-outs than humans . Mate . I won ! ( Computer bleeping ) - You did it again . - Just luck , George . - Let 's call it a day . - Sit down ! - That makes 17 games , Carl . - Just a lucky streak . This is a game of chance , right ? Sometimes I win , sometimes you win . Only mostly I win . How come I don 't win anymore ? I 'd just as soon stop . I 'm due back on shift soon . Oh , no . One more ! I want to know more about this lucky streak of yours . I want to see how long it goes on . - George , please . - One more . ( Beeping ) Play . ( Bleeping ) You ... punk ! You lousy two-bit cheat ! You 've been cheating ... ! - Easy , George . - Break it up . Right , what 's all the noise about ? He thinks I was cheating . It sounds crazy , but I can 't lose . Oh , boy ! You better stay out of games of chance . You 're too lucky for your own good . As for you , if you can 't take losing , don 't play . Now , get lost . - You were really brave . - ( Both laugh ) - Sorry to interrupt you guys . - Hi , Tone . Look , I hate to lay it on you just straight like this , but ... Sally Martin is dead . - Oh , no . - Sally , dead ? Yeah . We heard there 'd been an accident . But no one knew the full story . No one knows the full story ... yet . The Commander wants to ask you both a few questions . Maybe you can help . Sure . Anything ? How did Sally die , Tony ? No cuts or bruises . No blast burns . No sign that any weapon at all was used . But her body was shattered internally . John . I have Mark Sanders and Carolyn Powell outside . Let 's talk to them separately , Sanders first . I 'll check these findings with the lab . - Mark , sit down . - Thank you , sir . I 'm pretty shaken up over what 's happened . Yes , so are all of us . Whatever I can do to help . Mark , you and Sally . There was talk that you were getting married . - But you split up . - Why ? That 's a little personal , don 't you think ? Yes , it is . But our circumstances are unusual , to say the least . And we have to find answers . All right . Where were you when Sally was in Medical Stores ? I was in Carolyn 's quarters . Because , let 's say , Sally and I had our differences . Picking up where Sally left off ? That 's my business . And security on Alpha is my personal business , OK ? Now ... word was that Sally went around saying some un-ladylike things about you after you broke up . Are you trying to tell me I killed Sally just to shut her up ? You said that , not me . ( Powell ) I 'll admit I was jealous of Sally . But I did nothing to get her away from Mark . When he began seeing me , she was furious , and left the quarters we 'd been sharing . - She blamed you for the break-up ? - I tried to explain , but she wouldn 't listen . We had a terrible fight over it . Carolyn , we picked up rumours that ... you weren 't particularly fond of Sally . I didn 't hate her , but sometimes I wished she was dead so Mark could be free . I didn 't kill her and I don 't know who did . You 're experimenting on something in the labs . - Yes . - You haven 't submitted reports yet . I have an open-end priority on research . I don 't have to meet the Science Board until I 'm ready . Just exactly what results are you hoping for ? Frankly , I don 't know . I 'm just experimenting . And now , if the harassment 's complete ... May I go ? Yeah . Well ? If she 's perfected a device that can exert tremendous internal pressure ... She 's too smart to do something so stupid . Nobody ever accused a jealous woman of being rational in love . Only jealous men are rational ? She 's holding back ... I can feel it . Tony , don 't let prejudice cloud your reasoning . Yeah , well , that goes with my being head of security , Commander . Did you hear from Alan ? 75 % of Eagles are non-operational . - I saw that . - Sabotage ? Could be . Alan 's checking it . What gives you the right to touch this device ? Murder . I would like this device explained to me ! I don 't have to explain until I 've completed this experiment . You said that . I 'm not the Science Board . No . Just the one trying to humiliate me with your evil ideas ! - Why don 't you just leave me alone ? ! - Oh , I will , baby , if you 'll tell me about the principle of this device ! Questions like , " can it commit murder ? " Is that it ? Is that it ? ! Well , here 's your answer ! Stop that ! I said stop that ! Now you can 't blame the device for the next murder . - Are you expecting the next murder ? - Aren 't you ? I 've worked with Eagles all my life . I 'd sooner cut my granny 's throat . It 's on record . Every time a job 's come through you we 've had a malfunction . I 'd be risking my own neck . I 'm an Eagle test pilot as well as an engineer . - You were grounded after your crash . - That was nothing . - What , no after-effects ? - No . I was cleared by Doc Russell . I 'm fully operational . You know that . Well , if it 's not you , what is it ? I swear , I don 't know . Have a look at this . One starboard atomic booster motor in 100 % perfect condition . On the bench ... she runs like a dream . In the Eagle ... she 's dead . So I take her out of the Eagle , put her back on the bench and test her . There 's nothing wrong . So you tell me what 's happening . ( Comlock beeps ) Chief Engineer Garforth . ( Man ) ' Report to Maintenance please . Urgent ! ' They 're playing my song . I 've gotta go . I have to report to the Commander myself . - See you . - Yeah . ( Humming ) ( Beeps ) ( Humming intensifies ) Command Center ! Command Center ! ( Maya ) The electrical pulse is getting stronger . Computer read-out ? Nothing like it has ever been recorded . It could be a life form , couldn 't it ? ! Who knows ? Our sensors can 't give us a proper reading . - ' Maintenance . ' - Send Alan Carter down . 'He was in my workshop . Said he was coming to you . - ' Didn 't he get there ? ' - No . Thanks , Pete . If that thing might be affecting our sensors and the instruments on the Eagles , it might have something to do with what happened to Sally . It 's remote ... but possible . Tony , you and Maya go to Medical . Check on those autopsy reports . OK . ( High-pitched humming ) ( Beeps ) Alan ! Is that you in there ? Command Center ! Command Center ! ( Banging on door ) - Alan ! - Alan , can you hear us ? ! - Alan ! - Tony ? Get away from the door ! There 's an atomic motor about to go up in here ! Evacuate the area ! ( Rising hum ) We 've gotta break in there . ( Snarls ) ( Roaring - Hey , still in one piece ? - Yeah . Oh . Maya , you sure play rough , honey . What the hell went wrong this time ? Well ... I had the motor switched off , and it came on again by itself . No matter how I tried , I just couldn 't get it to go off . Even the connections were seized . Yeah , well , I 'd call that sabotage . Some unknown force kills Sally . Instruments go haywire , Eagles malfunction . An atomic engine starts by itself and won 't stop . All of this has happened since the appearance of that thing . - ( Bleeping ) - ( Maya ) Commander ... I 'm getting new readings . Lambda waves , Or something very like them . - Lambda waves ? - No , that 's the lambda variant . That 's ... very strange . Normally , the human brain swings between alpha waves and beta waves . Sometimes lambda waves are thrown off . Rarely , very rarely , the lambda variant . It was discovered during research on ESP powers . If it is sending off the lambda variant ... It could affect our people ? - Oh , yes . It could . - How do we find out ? Well , I could conduct some experiments . All right , go ahead . Right . ( Koenig ) Lambda waves ... Mark , sit down . Now , just relax . Each of these cards has a symbol on it a triangle , square , circle , cross , stars . I want you ... to tell me ... - How ? I can 't see the cards . - Exactly . Oh , I see ( ! ) Well , it beats me , but whatever you say . Cross . Another cross ? Circle . I have to move the ball without touching the box ? That 's right . - How ? - It 's easy . Just by concentrating . Very good , Mr Renton . I can tell you now , this is not gonna work . I 'm an engineer and I know metals . To bend this strip , you need a vice and a wrench . There 's no way I 'll affect this by ... Mark ... I was waiting for you . Yeah , I 'm sorry , I got tied up . Anyway , I knew I 'd see you here . - I 've got to talk to you . - Sure . - We 're doing these tests now . - I 've got to talk to you . Yes . We 'll speak later . Carolyn . Will you be next , please ? It would be a pleasure , Dr Russell . ( Woman whispering ) 'You killed us , John Koenig ... 'You killed us , John Koenig ... 'You left us to die . ' No . No , no . No , no , no . - ( Man ) ' You left us to rot . ' - No . ( Woman ) ' With Venusian plague . ' ( Man ) ' You left us to rot . ' No ! John ? I know it 's late , but ... Come on in . I wasn 't asleep . I 've got the preliminary test results . They 're fantastic . Over 90 % of subjects tested showed a significant increase - in paranormal powers . - They do ? There are three groups . The first shows a minimal increase . The second , the largest group , show a large increase over a wide range . - John ? - Go on - I 'm listening . The third group - here 's where the results get exciting - I call them " the sensitives " . I 've found three so far - Carolyn Powell , Carl Renton and Pete Garforth . Look , John , you need a good night 's sleep . - Take two of these ... - No . No . John ? Helena ... do you think the lambda variant could have anything to do with the way I 'm feeling ? I don 't know that , but I know you need some sleep . I can 't sleep . That 's why I want you to take these . Helena ... I 'm afraid to sleep . What is it , John ? Tell me . I told you part of it . A long time ago , when I was an astronaut cadet , we had to abandon some scientists on a Venus space station . I remember . You said they caught some Venusian disease . Yeah . Something for which there was there was no antidote . We couldn 't bring that disease back to Earth , an epidemic would 've killed millions of people . Before we discovered the disease ... two of our crew were on that space station - an advance party . Sam and Tessa . We left them to die with the others . There was no choice . And now ... every time I close my eyes , I ... I see them standing there , accusing me . It 's a dream , John . Just a recurring dream . Helena , Sam was my best friend . We went through astronaut school together . He and Tessa were gonna be married . You did what you had to do . Don 't you think I keep telling myself that ? - But it doesn 't do any good ! - You can 't go on without sleep . You 'll begin hallucinating and break down completely . If I DO go to sleep , I 'll go mad ! That 's an interesting problem , isn 't it , Dr Russell ? How do I command this base if I 'm losing my mind ? What happened about that test Helena was conducting ? Very interesting but nothing definitive . What is this thing ? It 's a force field , to block out the lambda variant . Good . That 'll upset that whirligig thing . This could point to the killer . Whoever still emits the lambda variant in here , could be involved in Sally 's death . ( Footsteps ) Mark ! I need you so badly . Carolyn , there 's something I must say . What is it , Mark ? What 's the matter ? I 've been thinking about us . Ever since Sally died ... What about ever since Sally died ? I 've had a feeling that you had something to do with it . How can you say that ? You lied when you said you didn 't try to get me from Sally . Everything I 've done is because I love you . - It isn 't gonna work . - You loved me ! You said so ! I 'm confused about a lot of things , but not about my feeling for you . What if I said I needed you ? That I needed you now . You 've changed , Carolyn . Something 's different about you . I don 't know what it is . I 'm sorry . I 'll never let you go . - No change ? - It 's still covering the base and there 's no way to know if we 'll get out of it . Commander ! Some sudden burst of energy . ( Wind howling ) Open the door ! Open it ! ( Moans ) Just like Sally . That thing didn 't do this . We were watching it . It was just sitting there , peaceful and cosy . Maya 's instruments recorded a tremendous surge of energy just before this happened . My vote goes to the human element . One of Helena 's " super sensitives " . - Carolyn ? - First Sally , now Mark . You name a better suspect . John , I 'd like to bring her in for questioning . Can you hold off until after the next tests ? John , we 've got three suspects now . Let me try to pinpoint it to one . OK . One more time . All right , but I wanna be there . There you go . Now what ? All right . Step in there , please . Take this with you ... and do exactly the same thing . That rules him out . I didn 't mean to hurt you , Mark . I told you I needed you , but you wouldn 't listen . You walked out of my life . You might 've been able to save me . But now it 's too late . It 's too late for everyone . That was just fine , Carl . - Thank you very much . - I only hope it helps . - You wanted to see me ? - Yes , Carolyn . - Please sit down . - What would you like me to do ? We 'd like your help with some tests . Message from Recreation Centre . Tests will be concluded in a ... - Commander ? What is the matter ? - No ... No ! No ! No ... ! You can 't escape us , John . We shall always be with you . You killed us , John Koenig . You left us to die . You can 't escape us . No ... No ... You can 't escape us . No . No . That 's just fine , Carolyn . Perfect score , just like last time . If you 'll take that and step into that booth , please , we 'll continue . All right . Why not ? I 'm sorry , Dr Russell , nothing 's happening . Well , it couldn 't have been her . I 'll make my report . Still , let 's not give up . Let me try harder . ( Carolyn laughing ) You play a child 's game , Doctor . Did you think I 'd be one of your children ? Thanks , Helena . Carolyn , you come with us . Of course I 'll come , Tony ( ! ) ( Snarling ) Helena , are you all right ? - Carolyn ? - ( Bleeping ) ( Sandra ) ' Commander Koenig has locked himself in his quarters . ' Come on . John ? Stand back . Emergency medical unit to Commander Koenig 's quarters . Priority one . Complete catatonic withdrawal . - Can you bring him out of it ? - With narcosynthesis . It 's old-fashioned , but the safest and best method . It allows the mind to jump barriers that it 's built up . This is a restricted message to security personnel . Carolyn Powell is to be found immediately . She is extremely dangerous . ( Wind rushing ) ) - You 're out of place , Carolyn . - You 're out of place , Alan . Your place is in Flight Control . Carolyn , please ... That would be too easy . Down on your knees , Mr Verdeschi . Kneel ! Kneel ! Now I command Alpha . Call me Commander ! ( Screeches ) Commander ! - I ... murdered ... them ! - They were your friends , they knew you . They ... keep coming back . Yes , you keep bringing them back . You keep punishing yourself for something you think they blame you for . They hate me ! Your ghosts hate you . Your ghosts are a creation of your own mind . ( Koenig ) I see them . They 're coming back again ... - You killed us , John Koenig . - You left us to die . I see them ... You left us to rot away with Venusian plague . They want me ... - ( Whimpering ) - John ! - John , look at me ! - No ! - Stop running away ! - No . Look at me ! John ... face your guilt . Your guilt is creating these ghosts . Face them , John ! Face them ! Sam ... Tessa ... You 're my friends . I love you . I left you to die . But I had to . You knew that . You had to know I had no choice . You had to know . I had to do it ! You 're not Sam . Tessa . You are not Sam and Tessa ! I am not ... guilty . John . All right now . All right . This way . Come on . Easy . Easy as can be . Come on . Here we go . It 's all right , John . Now , crawl , Mr Verdeschi . Crawl . Crawl to my feet , like a worm . San ! ( Carolyn ) Ah , Maya . Amuse us , my little alien friend . Show us some of your clever tricks . One or two shape changes ? - No ... - You will ! - No ... - Change ! Change into a monkey ! ( Carolyn laughs ) ( Squeals ) The results of the sensitivity tests , John . - Can you ... ? - Yeah , sure . Go ahead . The tests show that the lambda variant is acting as a stimulus to certain aspects of the psyche of those people that are in rapport with it . Carolyn was in rapport , right ? Carolyn and you , more than any of the others . Her ESP potential is very powerful . So that thing out there wasn 't using Carolyn , she was using it ? Not exactly . It seems to be a two-way process . Carolyn hated Sally and then Mark . Her hatred was amplified to the point that she wished them dead . She drew power from it and used that to kill them . Now ... a caterpillar . Shall I stamp the life out of her ? ( Tony ) No ! Please ! No ! No ! Please ! No ... No . I have a better idea . Such a pretty creature . So fragile . It should become a beautiful butterfly . Not ... enough ... air ... Suffocate ... " Not enough air . Suffocate " ? How much air does a caterpillar need , I wonder ? Suppose we find out . We can pass the time by watching Maya die . So , it boosted my guilt so that I created ghosts . My own ghosts , in the shape of Sam and Tessa . You overcame them . Your ESP potential is the only one equal to hers . That 's our weapon . She 's very , very dangerous , John . She can take hatred and turn it into violent physical force . ( Buzzer ) ( Monotone ) ' Carolyn Powell has taken over Command Center . 'She wants to see Commander Koenig . ' Commander Koenig will be there . Two ghosts down , one to go . You 're in the wrong place , aren 't you ? You no longer command Moonbase Alpha . Your authority has passed over to me . - Has it ? - From now on , I decide , you obey . Carolyn , I know what you want . - Do you ? - You want us to hate you , to attack you , so you can use the energy of our minds to build your strength . It 's not gonna work . We neither fear you , nor reject you . We ask you to come back to us . Use your powers for the good of Alpha . You want to trap me , you want to steal my power . Carolyn , we ... I rule Alpha now . Kneel ! You can 't harm us , Carolyn . You see , there 's no hate or fear for you to latch onto . The only one you can hurt is yourself . - Hate me ... - We can 't do that , Carolyn . There is no hate in us for you . Hate me ! - Hate me ! - I don 't hate you , Carolyn . Helena doesn 't hate you . San doesn 't hate you . Tony doesn 't hate you . Hate me ! I hate you ! I hate you ! ( Explosion ) ( Wind howling ) No ! ( Screams ) ( Wind subsides ) ( All groan ) It 's all right , Maya . ( Tony ) Take it easy . ( Maya gasps ) Look ! It 's left us , Carolyn . It 's gone . It can 't hurt you any more . Move . Come on , get out of that corner . ( Sighs ) Ah , no luck . Nothing . Don 't fret . It 's the same for everyone else . Carl 's back to losing games and Pete can 't bend metal strips . Just as long as he can fix Eagles . Right . Carolyn ... Well , for her , everything 's gone . Her powers , her memory , even her speech . She 's like a new-born child . She 'll have to grow up all over again . I 'm still not exactly sure why everything happened the way it did . Well , we were caught in a telepathic web and it increased the powers of our own minds . So we 're back to our un-magical selves . Can 't say I 'm sorry . Well , I am . Just a little . Our brains are such ... incredible instruments . Just think what we might be able to achieve ... ( Yawning ) if we knew how to use them to their fullest potential .

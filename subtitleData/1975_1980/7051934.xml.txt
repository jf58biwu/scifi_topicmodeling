 Kano . Computer 's got to be swamped with data , why isn 't it saying whether that planet support can life ? It 's been scanning continuously since we became aware of the planet but still reports it to be insufficient . How can it control a reconnaissance flight there and not tell us whether that surface can sustain life ? In neither case would the computer be so irrational as to ... guess . Moving into low orbit for final descent ... now , Paul . Confirm final descent now , Pete ? Yeah , we made good time . Or Computer made a bad mistake . They 're two hours ahead of schedule . Check the figures , Kano . When will they ever learn ? Hey , this one 's a weirdy , Ed . Is that what you expected ? Computer 's unusually reticent , I don 't know what to expect . They 're too low and their G-forces are increasing . - They 're doing fine by Computer . - Computer 's got to be wrong . Did you get that , Pete ? 'On course and holding , everything 's fine . ' They 're too close and too fast . Data discrepancy is increasing . Check it out manually , Pete . G-forces seven above estimate . They can 't hold that . Synchronise with their on board computer . Both computers confirm G-force is as estimated . They 're wrong . What are you doing ? ! A little low flying , you jealous ? Pete ? Pete ! All transmissions ceased . - Scanner ? - The blip just disappeared . I kept on telling you Computer had insufficient data . It cannot assess the planet without the right information . I am not concerned about Computer 's assessment . I want to know why it fouled up the flying data - time , distance , orbital velocity , rate of descent , G-factors . Kano , you 've got this all about-face ! But Computer does not make that kind of mistake . - You 're saying I do ? - Alan . - It was my mates that died . - Kane 's men are checking Computer . - But so far they 've found nothing . - Computer we can handle , but those two had no sense of danger . Because they believed what that lousy computer told them to . Which is why I want you to fly manual all the way . You 're not to rely on the computer at all . It 'll be a pleasure , Commander . Oh , Alan , for some reason Irving also ignored all advice from Main Mission . I want you to obey any order Paul gives you even if it sounds irrational . Like I said , it 'll be a pleasure , Commander . I 've put this chart together from some astro-shots I took myself . It seems we 'll have more time with planet Piri than Computer thought . See , the curve of our course is tightening , we 're being drawn closer than we expected . That could be either good or bad . If the planet can sustain us it gives us more time to explore and decide , but if affects us badly the closer we get the worse it 'll be . Are you all right ? Ooh , er , yeah . I just ... my head hurts and I feel a bit dizzy ... It 's all right , I 'll be all right ... Unconscious . Rapid heartbeat . According to his monitor , he 's fine . The amounts of oxygen in our atmosphere were slowly decreasing . Our hearts made a natural adjustment , Victor 's mechanical heart didn 't . So we can 't even rely on Computer for normal internal services . Damn it . Sandra , this is Koenig . Put Alpha atmosphere control on manual and keep your eye glued to it . We can 't put all services on manual , we don 't have enough personnel . - Cut the drip , Doctor . - Any after-effects ? No , no , I 'm all right . Just a few strange fantasies , that 's all . Any clue what 's happening to us ? Obviously we 're having some problems with Computer but we 'll be all right . I have a powerful instinct that Piri 's going to be just right for us You 'll have to convince me of that . Dr Russell ... She 's dead . The transfusion blood supply stopped . How could you allow this to happen ? I can 't control everything ! I am not a computer ! Yeah , Computer was wrong about the G-force . But I 've cut my approach speed right back ... and I reckon we 're holding her nicely . He 's right over the crash site . Down the line , Alan . They haven 't crashed . They 're all right . - Just ... hanging there , motionless . - ' What do you mean ? ' Don 't ask me how but she 's all in one piece . I 'm going to dock . Just keep her steady , Jonno . I 'm going through now , Paul . 'OK . Good luck . ' - Paul ? - ' Go ahead , Alan . ' It 's a Marie Celeste . There 's no one here . Alan ! Get back here . Kano , I want to talk to you . You can sit if you 'd like . What 's going on ? Straight and simple . We can find no fault in the system . I just left Diagnostic . Sarah Graham was hooked to a computerised monitor for a simple blood transfusion . She died . Professor Bergman 's collapse was due to lack of oxygen because Computer went haywire . It 's fouling everything from comlocks to important data and we 're in desperate trouble . L ... there have been ... We have to find out about that planet and Computer 's not functioning . Now , let 's find out why . But we can find no fault . Then maybe we 're looking in the wrong way . I don 't understand what 's going on on that planet nor what happened to Irving and Davis , but somehow that planet is affecting our computer here on Alpha . There 's one way ... I know to find out how . I have thought of it . Are you willing to go through with it ? As you say , Commander , there is only one way . - All set ? - All set . I 've asked Kano to go through this because of what 's happening here . Dr Russell will fill you in . Kano was one of the few people to take part in an experiment on Earth . He underwent an operation to implant a complex of sensors in his brain . The intention was to link the enormous memory and calculating ability of the computer with the unique ability of the human brain . That planet is affecting our computer here in a way we can 't detect . We hope that by getting inside that computer Kano can determine how it 's being affected . I swore I 'd never go through this again . Medically I was opposed to the experiment , but your case converted me . You mean I survived it once , but the other three patients ended up mindless vegetables . What does that do to my chances ? Yours was the undeniable success story . Let 's get on with it . Good luck , Kano . That 's it ! We 're in orbit . If we 're in orbit , we 're trapped . All the time we need . I don 't understand your sudden optimism . We 've lost three men and that doesn 't encourage me . We have no idea what happened to them , it could happen to any of us . Yet it didn 't happen to you . I was on manual . And instructed to disregard everything Computer told you . The planet will support life . - Details ? - To follow . We can 't rely on it . The computer 's telling us just what we want to hear . Well , there must be some kind of life there . Some power , at least . Mm , and not necessarily malevolent . Come on , John , cheer up . This could be the end of the road . When we leave Alpha for the last time it 'll be our decision , our choice . I don 't like being presented with an accomplished fact . Communications ? Not a whisper . Alan , we 're going down . Nice touchdown , Alan . Under no circumstances are you to leave the ship . And call you if anything happens . I wish I could be sure I 'd have time for that . No place like home - Helena ? - What have you found ? 'Whatever these things are or were , they 're dead now . ' Don 't give up , John . Early days yet . - See these things ? - ' Yeah , fascinating . ' 'I 'll take a walk . I 'll call if I see anything unusual . ' " Anything unusual " ? Pete ! Pete , you all right ? It 's Koenig . Pete ? Pete ? Ed ? Ed ? Kano ? Kano , it 's Koenig . Kano , talk to me ! Kano ! Kano ! Listen to me ! Computer is right . Piri is just perfect for all our needs . There 's nothing here , no life ! There is light ... I am sent to calm your fears and bring you peace . Welcome to Piri . I have come like this in human form so that you may understand my presence . Are you afraid of me ? No , you look very human . What worries me is what I don 't understand , what I can 't see . Who sent you ? I am the servant of the Guardian . We found your Moon floating helplessly . We have brought you here to relieve your human pain . - Are you inviting us to settle here ? - That is the will of the Guardian . Being human you are wondering about its power . Come , I will show you the peace of Piri . Millennia ago this planet was peopled by Pirians of great technical skill . They built machines to run the necessities of life , so they could enjoy their pleasure . Then they created the Guardian to control the machines and save them from decision . Their life was perfect and the Guardian was directed to maintain it . That 's not possible for human beings . We 're born , grow old and die . It 's transient , imperfect . Life can 't be maintained . Because you are imperfect , you Earthmen take time for granted . Absolute perfection lasts forever . And so the Guardian has suspended time . This place is not suitable for human life . - There are many forms of life . - We like the form we have . My men , how did you get them here ? We reached out and offered them happiness , and they accepted . - Time is stopping for them . - Life is stopping for them . - They are at peace . - Peace of death . You have seen , Commander , and have not understood . Your fear is from ignorance , and it has made you stubborn . But you will accept , as they have done . I 'll make them understand . That ... is not possible . They have accepted the dominion of the Guardian . Kano , come with me , you 're dying . - You must accept . - I will not accept ! - Come with me , Kano . - You must conform . Pete , come with me ! The Guardian is making you perfect , it is the prime directive . No ! Alan ! Prepare for lift-off , Alan . 'Commander , you do not know the power of the Guardian yet . 'But you will learn , 'as your people are learning . ' Come in , Carter . Alan ! Alan ! 'I 'm not receiving you , Alan ! 'Alan ! Answer me , Alan ! 'Are you all right ? Al ... ' - You all right ? - Yeah . I 've been calling , weren 't you receiving ? Yeah . I heard you . Nice place , huh ? Kind of peaceful . It 's no place for us , Alan . Nice people . Hello , Alpha . This is Koenig in Eagle 2-4 . Do you hear me ? 'Come in , Alpha . This is an emergency . 'Come in , Alpha . I need help . 'Alpha , I 'm not receiving . 'I 'm not receiving you . 'Paul , I need directions for final approach . 'Have Dr Russell and a medical team stand by . 'Carter is unconscious ... ' Come on ! ♪ All together now ... ♪ All right , everybody ! A toast ! To the new world ! And our very own Christopher Columbus who discovered it ! ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow ♪ And so say all of us ! ♪ Ah , Commander . Relax , Commander , relax . You had a fall , you passed out at the party , that 's all . Party ? Here , drink some of this . Dr Russell , where is she ? She 's attending a command conference . Commander ? Good morning , Commander . Morning , sir . 'Section D7 will complete loading on schedule at 0958 . 'Eagle 2-6 will liftoff from Launch Pad One . 'Taking up parking position on lunar surface at station 3-0-5 . ' Morning , Commander . 'Eagle 2-7 will stand by in loading bay 8 'to await further instructions . ' That 's not something to worry about . All right , we won 't worry . Of course a lot depends on how our lives turn out in practice on Piri , but I don 't see any need for me to take the space in an Eagle with an operating theatre . Right . Of course , the beauty of this situation is that with the Moon in a fixed orbit we can return as and when we like . When someone needs an operation we bring him back , perform the operation and return . - That 's it . - Best of both worlds . John , just arrived ? You 're just in time . We 're planning the last phase of Operation Exodus . - You have no idea what 's down there . - No , but your reports were explicit . - Reports ? - Yeah , here . These aren 't my reports , it 's all phoney . Listen ... The Guardian 's attacked our computer and your minds ! We 've almost come to the end of our journey ! Helena , I 've seen what it 's done to Kano , Davis and Irving ! Cabbages ! And we almost went right by ! He 's scheduled for medical Eagle 10 . He 'll be adequately taken care of . It 's good to be leaving , Commander . 'Commander 's instructions conflict with Guardian 's orders . Commander ! John ! - John ? - I 'm not mad , Victor . - I 'm the only sane one on Alpha . - All right , all right . Listen to me ! You 're in danger ! The Guardian is taking over your minds ! - John ... - Victor , listen to me ! - John , it 's all right . - Helena ... 'Your comlock facility is withdrawn . 'You are confined to your quarters . ' - By whose orders ? - ' Operation Exodus committee . ' I said who , individual . - Grounds ? - ' Diminished responsibility . ' No , Computer , you threaten the safety of Alpha . John is conscious again but Computer says he 's as pig-headed as ever . Ohh ... Let 's not take him . Oh , no , he 'll wanna come . He 'll change his mind . He 's so inflexible . Well , a few days solitude 'll soon straighten him out . Do you know what ? We 'll leave him an Eagle , and then when he comes to his senses he can join us in his own good time , mm ? OK . All right , Computer , I have to talk to someone . I took you for a strong-willed man . How long do you think you can last ? Three days of despair have reduced you to pills to sleep the hours away . In this crude human way , you try to numb your mind against the Guardian . And yet the Guardian could make the process so much easier for you . If only you would choose the Pirian way . You fought hard in the struggle for survival . The burden of responsibility has almost been unbearable , and yet you 've borne it . Now you can relax and enjoy the peace that you 've earned for your people . Your wounds are healed , and your friend Dr Russell has not had to lift a finger . You see ? Her nerves are relaxed , her appetites assuaged . The struggle is over . And you can join her in paradise . No ! Leave me with my pain . It reminds me I 'm human . For some reason you 've brought us here , fixed us in orbit and reduced my people to that . By your presence in our universe , you have disturbed the peace of Piri . You must be made fit to live here . - That is the Guardian 's directive . - So you sabotaged our computer ? It was not sabotaged , merely taken over for the Guardian 's use . Of all things on Alpha , its mind was most nearly perfect . It most readily accepted the Guardian . That 's because the computer is a machine , but human beings can 't exist in Pirian terms . Can 't you make the Guardian understand this ? Can 't the Pirians themselves see ? Perfection is absolute . You must be made perfect . Not even to have to worry about the problems of day-to-day subsistence . I used to dream about this . Mmm . To opt out . To be able ... at long last ... to fulfil our true potential ... as thinking human beings . There 's John . I wonder if we should go to meet him ? Mm ? He 'll find his way . Sandra . The Pirians , where are they ? Sandra ? ! There are many forms of life , but this is beautiful . - Paul , I need your help . - We 're all so happy ! - The Pirians , where are they ? - We 're happy . Helena ! Helena ! Helena ? ! Hey , hey ... Easy , Commander . Easy . Helena ! Helena ? ! Helena ! Helena ... why didn 't you answer me ? John , you 've come to join us at last . Where are the Pirians ? They 've given us eternal life . Come . Oh ... that 's John . Hey , Helena , come on . Let 's go . All right , Helena , sit down , just there . Sit back . OK , John ... Give me your hand ... Lie back , Helena . Let me take this off . Shock treatment . Had my heart stopped ? Worse , much worse . It 's good to have you back . Start at the beginning . Tell me exactly what happened . You 're on the planet Piri . Yes ... The Exodus . We went down to the planet . Tell me about the people , how did they welcome you ? There was just this light . That 's the Guardian , what about the people who control it ? I didn 't see any people . Helena , you were in a trance . Think hard . Were there any machines ? Nothing . Nothing moves . There 's no sign of life . No sign of life . That 's it . There is no life . There are no Pirians . Creatures of the Moon ! The Guardian takes pain from your lives to make them perfect . - We are grateful ! - We are grateful ! - The Guardian has made you happy . - We are happy ! - We are happy ! - And peaceful . We are peaceful ! - You would not have peace disturbed ? - NO ! One amongst you threatens your happiness , who comes to destroy your peace . He will not accept the dominion of the Guardian . He must be destroyed . Destroy him ! He is your Commander , John Koenig . You must destroy him so the Guardian may live and protect you forever . - There 's Koenig ! - Go back to Alpha ! - Why don 't you go back ? - We want to stay here ! Helena , stay back . Helena , this way ! He 's only stunned . There 's no place on Piri for you , Koenig . You 're destroying our peace . We 're going to kill you now . Where are your own people ? ! They don 't exist , do they ? ! No , they died , just as my people are dying right now , of total apathy . This is what passes for life on Piri ! The Moon 's going out of orbit ! Head back to the ships ! Main motors . Main motors . - Ignition . - Lift off ! So when you destroyed the girl you destroyed the Guardian . And with no Guardian to suspend time , time was restored and we were back on our original course . Commander ! Computer has analysed the data from the sensors . Planet Piri now has life , water , vegetation , everything ! We 've brought a dead planet back to life . Maybe we should have stayed .

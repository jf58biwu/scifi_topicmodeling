 Nanu-nanu . MM - s01e13 - Mork 's First Christmas Shazbot ! Hi , Mork . Be calm . Okay . Everything is going to be all right , but just start packing , okay ? ! What ? We 've got to get out . We 're going to blow this burg . It 's over . The party 's over ! Boulder 's had it . What are you talking about ? There 's a plague ! It 's an epidemic . It 's called Christmas ! Oh ... the Christmas plague . You know about it . It affects the brain . There 're mindless hordes all out in the street milling around . Last night , while you were at school , there was a roving gang terrorizing the neighborhood . They were just singing for trouble . Singing for trouble ? Yes , they wanted to beat up Monty Hall and his family . They were going from house to house singing , " Deck the halls , deck the halls ... " Mork , those are Christmas carolers . They 're harmless . Oh , a lot you know . Quick ! We 've got to get you out of here ! The whole town 's under martial law . There 's a little fat dude in a red suit on every corner and he 's called , he 's called Santa Claus . And he 's stopping everybody ! And people are really sick 'cause they 're putting plastic babies on everybody 's lawn covered in straw . I don 't know , but we 've got to get out of here before we 're all infected ! Mork . Mork . Relax . Now , this might be hard for you to understand , but it 's all part of our Christmas holiday . Oh , that explains it . You see , the men in the red suits are collecting money for people that are less fortunate . And the carolers are singing because that makes people happy . Oh , yeah ? Tell that to the " Halls " after they 're decked . You see , this holiday is to celebrate the birth of one of Earth 's greatest men called Jesus Christ . Oh , is that the guy with the glasses that runs Boulder Stereo ? No , I don 't think that 's him . You see , Jesus was a wise and wonderful man . That 's why this time of year brings out the best in people . It 's a time for caring and sharing , when you open up your heart to your fellow man . Oh , I see . For a few short weeks each year , humans try to act human . Well , it 's a start . Well , it 's a darn good one . Orson will be pleased to hear about this . ( doorbell rings ) I 'll get it . ( utters Orkan sounds ) Mindy , you don 't have to worry about snowing tonight , because here 's your fair-weather friend , Susan . Mork , Mork , Mork , Mork , Mork . Oh , Sue , Sue , Sue , Sue , Sue . You 're such a dear child . Well , Susan Taylor , whatever brings you into this neighborhood ? After all , there 's no valet parking . Mindy ! Oh ! Nonsense . I 'd go to a tacky area to see a friend . Oh , that 's nice . I know . So , what brings you by ? Oh , Christmas . You know , at Christmas you stop to think about your friends , and that 's why I 'm here . After all , you two are my best friends . We 're your only friends . Oh , what beautiful Christmas cards . Where did you buy them ? Oh , she didn 't . One man gave them all to her . Aha . The mailman . Oh , that 's the guy . The one with the well-stuffed pouch . Did you string up your Christmas cards ? Oh , sort of . I hung up my ... Christmas card . Oh , then I 'll give you a card . Here , are you into camels ? Oh , thank you , Mork , but it 's just not the same . Cute camel , though . Oh , Mindy , your place is just so homey , not like mine . I mean , mine is just so gosh - darned elegant . It 's just that it 's not really the kind of place you 'd like to spend Christmas in ... all alone . Oh , loneliness . Heavy sigh . I know . What about that guy you 're dating ... uh , the lawyer ? Oh , Patrick . Oh , well , no , we 're not going to be able to spend Christmas together . He has this silly quirk about spending the holidays with his wife . That 's easily fixed . Just have him come over and bring the little woman along . Mork , she doesn 't know that I exist . Oh , that 's probably why she didn 't send you a card . But you have to let people know what you 're doing . Uh ! I have the solution . Why don 't you come over here for Christm ... Excuse me , Mork , I forgot I have to talk to you . You were going to invite her to spend Christmas with us , weren 't you ? Uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh . I got the right idea . I think fast . I want to spend Christmas with you , Dad and Grandma . So does she . But I don 't want to spend it with her . Why ? You told me Christmas was a time of caring and sharing , a time when you open up your heart to your fellow man or strange woman . What made you change your mind ? I didn 't change my mind . I just ... Oh , you don 't understand . I think I do understand . You didn 't mean what you said . It was a nice idea , though , this ... But I guess this Christmas is just a sham . No , I mean , it 's still a nice idea , but ... she 's just so ... ( disgusting groan ) . And her ego is so inflated . Oh , all right , ask her . Oh , thank you , Mindy . Susan , even though you 're yech ! And inflated , would you like to spend Christmas over here ? Well , I suppose I could change my plans . Swell . Gee , I forgot . I can 't . Oh , that 's too bad . Well , maybe next year . Well , I 'm a nooner . I could never possibly get here in time for the festivities . Oh ... Well , I 'll wake you up . Well , if it 's that important to you , I suppose I could come over and spend Christmas Eve here , and then you could wake me up in time for the fun in the morning . Okay , you win . Thank you for thinking of us . What are friends for ? Well , listen , I really do- - I do prefer to have the Christmas meal around 1 : 00 . Oh , fair warning : I only eat white meat . Well , I guess we 'll have to get a Caucasian turkey then . Oh , we 're going to have such fun . Ciao . Grub . See , Mindy , aren 't you glad we did the right thing ? ( knock on door ) MORK : In come . Eugene ! What 's action , faction ? Uh-uh-uh . What 's this ? A tree . A tree in bondage ? Eugene , you 're weird . Why are you dragging this dead thing around ? Haven 't you seen a Christmas tree before ? Oh , a Christmas tree . No . Man , sometimes you act like you 're from another world . It 's a Christmas tree . You decorate it . Why ? Well , Mork , there are certain things you do on Christmas . One , decorate the tree . Two , eat turkey . Three , exchange gifts . Whoa , munchkin . Run the gift part by me again . Well , Mindy 'll buy you something . And probably her Dad and Grandma . Oh , and ipso facto , I 'm supposed to buy them something . Now you got it . Ooh , what a pleasant tradition . SUSAN ( sing-song ) : Knock , knock ... Who 's there ? Susan . Susan who ? Susan Taylor . What a terrible knock-knock joke . Oh , Mork , I 'm so full of the essence of Christmas . I 'd like you to meet my main munchkin , Eugene . Oh , Mork , I am so thrilled . Hello , there . I am so thrilled that you and Mindy have invited me to spend this special time of the year with you that , well , I 've decided to share with you one of my most cherished possessions . A heavenly top piece for our tree- - my Gucci angel . Well , any friend of yours is a friend of ours and your winged guest is welcome here . Fly , little friend , be free ! Oh , heavy remorse . I 've killed your flighty friend . I 'm sorry . It was your most prized possession . That 's all right . I have six more at home . Well , I must fly . Oh , think of your friend . Oh , that reminds me . I 'll drop off another angel with Mindy later . Ciao . Pekinese . Boy , she 's something else . Yeah , I like her , too . Eugene , would you come with me and help me pick out presents for the family ? Sure . But I gotta tell you something . That lady friend of yours has the wrong idea about Christmas . She does ? Yeah . Getting presents is nice , but giving presents is what the gig 's all about . Oh , like Mindy said , caring and sharing . Right . It 's the time of the year when everyone 's full of brotherly love . Will you let go ? ! I saw it first ! I got more of it ! No , you haven 't ! Hey , girlie , can you help me ? Come back here ! Come back here ! WOMAN : You had plenty yesterday . Don 't you have one with green ? Mork ? ! Mork ? ! Eugene ! You can 't buy anything under there . Come on out . Oh , no way , Jose . Nyet , nix . I 'm no chump . These people are out for blood . I 'd rather go swimming in a blender . Hey , Mork , here comes a salesman . Can I help you ? You can help me . What ? He 's scared to come out . Will you come out of there right now ! No ! Face it like a man ! Hey , everybody , there 's a sale on the second floor . 110 % off ! That 's right , 110 % off . I 'm sorry . I had to save myself , and besides I all I want is just a sweater . It 's all right . They 'll be back when they find out there 's no second floor . What kind of sweater do you want ? Well , I 'd like to go big-time maybe . Cardin , Yves St. Laurent . I 've got 12 bucks . 12 bucks ? Oh , yeah , I 've got to buy three presents with that or four , including Susan . Twelve bucks , huh ? I 've got an idea for you , friend . Why don 't you do your shopping at McDonald 's ? All right , Eugene , we 're off to the Golden Arches . Mork , he was putting you on . Oh , I guess 12 bucks doesn 't buy very nice presents then . Not for that many people . Too bad . At home we used to make presents for people ... Sure , you can do that . I thought that 's against the law . You know , because on TV they say you 've got to buy everything . It 's part of the commercialization of Christmas , you know . The stores would rather you buy them . There 's no reason you can 't make them . Oh ... oh , yay , excitement , tingle . I 've got to get the material then . Let 's see , what do we need ? We need lots of gum ... ball of string ... some dust balls , a little tiny whip . MORK : Mindy , guess what ? What ? I have a surprise for you . I 've hid your present all over the house . You 'll never be able ... Don 't sit there ! Why did you hide your presents ? Why didn 't you just put them under the tree ? I didn 't want you to see them . Didn 't you wrap them ? You 're supposed to wrap your presents ? Yes . Okay . You 're nothing ! You 're skuz ! You 're not worth the money ! You 're awful ! Who would buy you in a million years ? ! Doesn 't sound very Christmasy to me . Mork , look . See- - a little paper , a little ribbon , nice little bow . This is how we wrap presents . Oh , that 's a lot more in the spirit of things . Yes . Well , guess what I got for you . Go on , take a guess . Come on , just one guess . No , I don 't want to guess . I don 't want to ruin it . Oh , party pooper . Well , I 'll guess what you got for me . Come on , let me guess . No . Just give me a hint ! Give me a hint ! Give me a hint ! No , Mork . You 're just going to have to wait till tomorrow morning . You know , you 're just like a little kid . ( high-pitched hum ) Don 't ... don 't shake it . You 're going to break the ... What ? Oh ... cute . SUSAN : Knock-knock . Don 't say , " Who 's there ? " It 's a set-up for a terrible joke . MORK : Entre vous . Hi , there . Oh , look at all the beautiful presents . How nice . I only got one gift myself this year . It 's from my boyfriend , Patrick . And his wife ? I doubt it . You know what he gave me for Christmas ? A picture of himself . And you opened it ? No , I don 't have to , I know . That 's what I 'm giving for Christmas this year . That man doesn 't have a single bit of imagination . Oh , well , Susan , forget about Patrick . We 're going to see that you have a really nice Christmas this year . Yes , we have presents- - even for you . That 's nice . Look , I really appreciate your inviting me over here for the holidays . I know I kind of wangled my invitation , but , uh ... well , I 'm really glad you invited me , and I think we 're going to have a really nice Christmas . Oh , I know we are . Since everyone 's in the Christmas spirit , let 's open those presents ! Now , I told you , we 're going to open our presents tomorrow morning when Dad and Grandma get here . Do you think you can wait that long ? Who me ? Yeah , you . ( chuckles ) Remember me ? Mork the emotionless ? I 'm in control . Everything 's cool . Tell you what- - tomorrow morning when they get here , you just give me a buzz . If the energy 's right , I 'll come down . We 'll have a cocktail . We 'll talk . 'Cause you know , Christmas is really for kids . Well , it is getting late . I think we probably should hit the sack . Tomorrow 's going to start pretty early . Okay . You know , in spite of what he just said , Mork certainly seems to be excited about Christmas . Oh , he is . It 's like it 's his first one . You see , his , uh , parents , never celebrated Christmas . Oh , that 's sad . Yeah , it is . Mork and I have a lot in common . ( singing in Orkan ) ( Simon game beeping ) Catchy tune . Oh , look at this lovely brooch cameo from the antique shop . Oh , isn 't it lovely ? Oh , Fred , how did you know I wanted it ? Well , I overheard you mention it to Mindy . Every day since July . Oh , Mindy , thank you so much for the gloves . They 're really nice . Oh , you 're welcome . Oh , and thank you for the lovely picture of yourself . It 's time for my presents now . I saved the best for last . ( babbling ) ( whistling ) Grandma ... may all your Christmases be bright . Oh , thank you . Pops , keep those chestnuts roasting . Susan , this is even better than your picture . And Mindy , for you . And thanks for being such a swell roomy . Oh , thanks , Mork . Say , this is nice . What is it ? Well , you said you 've always wanted a rug- - try it on . Just like Howard Cosell , and it 's indoor / outdoor . Um ... a-a painting ? Oh , yes . You said you liked music and antiques , so I combined the two and I made a portrait of Liberace made out of old bubble gum . I painted each wad myself . Well , it 's , um ... it 's unusual . Oh , I knew you 'd like it . Gee , I can 't wait to see what I got . Well , yours is the only one I bought , 'cause you said you wanted something returnable . A saucer ? Surprised ? Oh , yes . Uh , why a saucer ? Well , Mindy said you 'd only appreciate something shallow . Well , it ... it 's a bracelet . No , it 's a lawnmower . Of course , it 's a bracelet . Oh . It 's handmade by Mork . Oh ... it 's really interesting . What kind of beads are these ? Oh , they 're not beads , and I know you 'll love it , because there 's a whole collection up in the attic . They 're flies . They can 't fly now , silly , they 're dead . And look , I hand-painted each and every one of their eyes- - which was really a drag , took a long time- - and I made , I made little clothing for them . Little pants , too . Oh , look , look- - his human 's open . And if you look real close and you hold them up to the light , you can see I put sequins on the wings so they could look like Liza Minelli in Cabaret . Isn 't it incredible ? I knew you 'd like it . Oh ... It was just worth it just to see the surprised look on your face . Well , I-I appreciate the fact that it took you so long to make that . Um , could you put that in the box for me ? Oh , you know why I put it in such a big box ? Why ? So you couldn 't guess what it was . ( laughs ) Did I fool you ? ( honking bark ) You sure did , boy . I never would have guessed what was in there . Well , did everyone like my swell gifts ? ALL : Oh , yes . Well , if you liked those , wait till you see what I got for the entire house . It 's something everybody can use . Oh , dopey me . It must be upstairs . I 'll go get it . ( singing in Orkan ) Will you look at this ? Oh , my gosh . I agree , but what can you say to the guy ? Oh , no . What I thought was a picture from Patrick , it 's a thousand dollar bill . Oh , no , I didn 't get him anything because I thought he gave me a crummy picture . Oh , I 've got to think of something that I can get for him and leave it in his mailbox . I know . I 'll leave him one of my Gucci angels . Oh , folks , now you got to admit it- - this is what Christmas is all about . Not like those stupid presents Mork made for us . Merry Christmas ! FRED : Well , what should we do ? I don 't know . Poor Mork . I 'm so embarrassed for him . He worked so hard on the ... on all this stuff . I know . A rug , gum and dead flies . It 's tough to warm up to . Oh , the poor boy . Do we tell him ? I mean , we don 't want him to make the same mistake next year . Dad , how do we tell him ? Did you see the look on his face ? MORK : You don 't have to . I made a fool out of myself . MINDY : Mork ... I 'm sorry I embarrassed you . I 'll be up in my room . Wait a minute . Okay , so your presents weren 't very practical , but it doesn 't matter . Oh , Mork , Dad 's right . It 's not the gift , it 's the thought that counts . CORA : That 's true , Mork . It is the thought . Thoughts are important ? Well , of course . I should have given you one of those for Christmas . What ? A thought . You can give a thought ? No , but you can give it to yourselves , I can make it happen . Let me show you . ( sustained tones ) I don 't believe it . What was your thought ? Well , when I was a little girl , I used to have this dog named Peppy . And I , I let him loose one afternoon at a picnic and-and he ran away . A week went by and I thought that he 'd gotten run over by a car . And I just remember the way I felt the day that Peppy ran up the driveway . Oh , thanks , Mork . What about you , Grandma ? Well , I was just remembering my husband and our first Christmas together . We , uh , we couldn 't afford furniture or gifts for each other , but we bought a tree . And it was the best Christmas ever . What 's wrong , Pops ? Nothing . Nothing at all . You just made me remember the first time I held my newborn daughter . My hands were so large and clumsy . I just couldn 't believe anything so tiny could make me so happy . Thank you , Mork . Me , too , Mork . Thank you , from the bottom of my heart . I 'd forgotten how much I loved that dog . You like it better than flies ? ( chuckles ) Yes , even better than flies . Whew . I want to say something to you , too . This is my first Christmas and you made it really wonderful . Thank you . Well ...

 Eagle Two Nine approaching asteroid , Commander . Eagle Ten descending with nuke . Eagle Ten to Alpha . Nuclear charge in place . Mission completed . Returning to base . Eagles Ten , Eleven and Twelve have laid their charges and are returning to base , sir . What 's happened to Alan ? Still nothing from Eagle One . - Kano . What 's happened to Eagle One ? - Eagle One 's in trouble . Yeah . The problem 's in the main booster . I can 't get the speed . He 's got to make it . We need twelve nuclear explosions to guarantee the chain reaction ... .. that will destroy the asteroid and avoid a collision . We 're losing the time-line , Commander . Alan needs a minimum of a hundred and ten seconds to get out before we detonate . Delay the blast forty seconds . Can 't do it . We 've gotta destroy that asteroid . Timing 's vital to avoid being caught in radiation from the blast ourselves . Delay the blast forty seconds ! Alan , we must detonate those nukes in two minutes . Can you make it ? All the way , Commander . Alan . Don 't worry about perfection , just get in and get out . The release mechanism 's jammed . Time 's running out . Alan . We 've got to have it there . Or else we 'll all die . She 's going . She 's gone ! - We 've lost the time line . - Blast in ten seconds . Nine . Eight . - Delay ten . Blast now T minus fifteen . - Alan . You 've got another thirteen seconds . - Thanks . Good luck . Red alert . Activate radiation screens . Five . Four . Three . Two . One . Activate . SPACE 1999 SEPTEMBER 13TH 1999 COLLISION COURSE Eagle One , do you copy ? - Come in , Eagle One . - No , he didn 't stand a chance . No . I want damage reports from all sections . Getting them now , sir . Come in , Eagle One . Eagle One , do you read me ? - Alan , do you read me ? - Radiation screens at full power now . - Full power confirmed . - So we just wait for the screens to crack ? - Let 's be grateful we 've got this far . - Thanks to Alan . Come in , Eagle One . Come in , Eagle One . - Alan , do you read me ? - John . That 's not helping any of us . Sandra . I want a scanner report . I am trying , sir , but these readings do not make sense . - It is the radiation . - What about the orbital satellites ? Their transmissions cannot penetrate the radiation cloud . Structural damage in Maintenance Section B four . Computer reports power failure in Residence Buildings C and D. - Medical section reports fourteen casualties . - Radiation ? - No . Conventional injuries only , so far . - Keep calling Alan . - Come in , Eagle One . - It may help him to know we 're still alive . - Alan , can you hear me ? - John , please ... Victor , if you 're trying to tell me I made the wrong decision , tell me that . If you 're trying to tell me that I 'm wasting my time trying to reach Alan out there .. .. through that radiation cloud , tell me that . But if you 're ... .. telling me that you don 't think Alan is alive out there ... I don 't want to hear that . It was a human decision , John . None of us would have decided any other way . - But now we 've got a new situation to face . - Yeah , but very few facts . Eagle One , do you copy ? Alan , can you hear me ? Wait a minute . Wait a minute . There it is . We 're still getting our own orbital satellite identification signal . Yes . But that is on the interstellar frequency band . Exactly . Which Alan doesn 't have . But if we equip an Eagle with one and send it up through the radiation cloud ... .. we can establish three way contact between it , Alan and Alpha . Paul , I want you to prepare an Eagle for the job . If Alan 's anywhere out there we 're going to find him . Commander , we are at risk from radiation here on Alpha . If you fly an Eagle through that radiation cloud ... .. Alpha has radiation screens and so do the Eagles . Effective against certain classes of radiation that we know about ... .. but out there is a kind of radiation we know nothing at all about . Victor . If he 's not out there I want to know it for a fact . Paul . Put an Eagle on Pad Two . - Pad Two 's damaged . - Pad Four might function . Make it function . I have four warning lights here . On the secondary systems . But they 're minor . - I say we disregard them . - I agree . Otherwise we 're ready to lift off . - Clear to go . - Good . Main Mission . This is Koenig . We have lift off . Visibility nil . No instruments , visibility nil and he has no idea where Alan is ... .. or even if he is alive at all . - It defies logic . Yes . It 's a thing called faith . Hello , Eagle One . Hello , Eagle One . Eagle One , do you copy ? - Keep trying . - Come in , Eagle One . Eagle One , do you copy ? Can you give me your last position , Alan ? We 're on our way to bring you in . Come in , Eagle One . Eagle One , do you copy ? Are you feeling better ? You 're quite safe now . Come in , Eagle One . Eagle One , do you copy ? Can you hear me ? Speak to them . Hello , Alpha . Alpha , this is Eagle One . He 's alive . Paul , did you hear that ? He 's alive . Alan , this is Paul . We 're up here in Eagle Four . Steer us to your position . Alan , this is Paul . Did you get that ? Eagle One , do you copy ? - He 's not receieving us . - Paul . Fix his position . Give us a course . Your friend is at orbital reference ... .. three four nine . - Course computed and programmed . - I haven 't got his position yet . I have . There he is . Hello , Alpha . We 've found Eagle One . It 's drifting just outside the plasma cloud . - Not too much damage . - Well done , John . - We 're moving in now to dock . - Good luck . Docking procedure checked and programmed . Check docking procedure and program . Confirmed . Docking secure . Check . Well done , sir . Yeah . He handled that docking beautifully . I don 't think he 's too badly hurt . You hold her steady , I 'm going in there . Your own people will take care of you now . Who are you ? A friend . - Paul ? - How is he ? He 's alive but unconscious . The effort of that docking must have been too much for him . - My God .. ! - Commander ? Commander , what 's wrong ? Commander ? Commander . - Return to base . - Why ? Another collision course . Only this time it 's a planet . A massive planet . There 's no getting away with this one , Paul . Thanks , Paul . Stay with him till the medics arrive . Then report to my office . - Decontamination procedure ? - Forget it . We 're running out of time . - Medical . - Yes , John ? Skip the radiation check . We 're in trouble . It won 't take a moment . Medical Team is standing by . Look , you can 't keep me here , I 've got lots to do . Doctor . He 's clear . Carter 's in Eagle One , with Morrow . Kano . Process this information from the on board computer . Give me a report as quickly as you can . - Victor , we 're in trouble . - Yes , but if you hadn 't gone out there ... .. we wouldn 't have known anything about this planet till it hit us . We never would have known . Probably been better off . - Well ... I 've been thinking . - It 's the best news I 've had today . - How 's Alan ? - Clean as a whistle . - No radiation ? - No radiation . What are we going to do about it ? One thing 's for sure . We won 't be able to destroy it like we did the asteroid . - My guess is it 's thirty times the size of the Moon . - Thirty four . And it is on a collision course . Impact will be in one hundred and five hours and some thirteen minutes from now . I 'm worried . - Well , the Eagles have radiation screens . - Yes , I know . But he spent three hours in that cloud . I 'd be surprised if he wasn 't affected in some way . - How about this ? - Mm ? We alter our own trajectory by setting up a blast on the other side of the Moon . - Julie . - Yes . - Go on . We recreate by design the accident that originally blasted us out of Earth 's orbit . Save the planet the trouble by blowing ourselves up . - We survived it once . - By a miracle . - Isn 't that exactly what we 're asking for ! ? - Fine , but don 't ask computer to work it . Easy , come on . We 're trying to come up with a realistic plan to avoid disaster . - We 've no time for this . - Just a minute , John . The , ah , the principle of Paul 's suggestion is dead right . We 've gotta alter our trajectory relative to the planet ... .. but perhaps we can do it another way . Now , suppose we make a force between ourselves and the planet . We could put down a chain of nuclear charges like mines moored in space ... .. and make a shockwave between the Moon and the planet ... .. which might force them apart . Change their trajectory . - It makes a lot of sense . - I think it 's the only possibility . All right , Victor . Get to work on it . I 'd like to see a detailed plan . - Sandra , what have you learned about the planet ? - It has an atmosphere . - Go on . - But it is not ideal . - Breathable ? - I think we could survive . Temperatures range from a high of approximately ten degrees centigrade to minus thirty . So it is almost certain that some kind of life could exist there . Yeah . The question is what kind of life . We 'll bombard that planet with every kind of communication we can devise . Paul , you 've overlooked something . We 're still isolated by that radiation cloud . All the information we 've gotten has come from the on-board computers on my Eagle . If we want to glean more information from that planet it means a reconnaissance flight . John . If that planet is habitable , even though conditions may not be ideal ... .. we could evacuate all our people to the far side . Yeah . The question is can that planet withstand a collision with the Moon ? How long is a piece of string ? All right , Victor . I 'll tell you what . I 'm going to go out there and take a look at that planet . Meantime you start Operation Shockwave . If I find that planet 's habitable ... .. we 'll have to make a spot decision as to whether we chance an evacuation . - Who are you ? - A friend . Why have you come to me ? - Where have you come from ? - You are quite safe now . Who are you ? Who ... .. are you ? Alan . - No . Where are you ? Come back . Don 't leave me now . - Nurse . Take me with you . Take me with you ! Take me to your people ! - Bob . - Where are you ? It 's all right , Alan . It 's all right . You 'll be all right now . - Give him sedative will you ? - What 's all this about ? Hallucination , disorientation . Classic symptoms of radiation sickness . He has been affected . Well , that 's not possible . The instruments cleared him . Well , they 're wrong , and they 're probably wrong about you too . Helena . Look . The man 's been unconscious . Dreaming . Maybe having a nightmare . - That was no nightmare . - Now how the hell can you be so sure ? Because I know my job . Look , except for Alan , both you and Paul have had the greatest exposure . Look , I 'm not hallucinating . Okay , maybe ... maybe my reactions were a bit hasty , but so was your assessment . My assessment is based on experience . And with no help from the clock . Extensive tests take time , John . Look , I think he has been affected , and if I 'm right ... .. then you 've gotta be suspect . - Now look , Helena ... Yes , Paul ? Reconnaissance Eagle ready on Pad Four . Copilot Pierre Daniel is standing by . - Thanks Paul , but I 'm going alone . - You 're not going out again ? Don 't worry . I 'll wear my galoshes . Main Mission . This is Koenig calling on interstellar frequency . - How do you read ? - Very loud and very clear . Looks like the radiation cloud is dispersing . Sandra 's data from your on-board computer confirms that . We 're receiving it 's information and we copy . How 's Operation Shockwave coming along ? Professor Bergman 's made his first computation . - Looks possible . - Good . Soon as Victor 's happy with the plan ... .. I want you to start placing the nuclear charges in position . Alpha Main Mission , we copy . Well , Professor . Are you happy ? Far from it , Paul . I suppose it makes some sort of sense . Then we go ahead . I think so . - There is life on the planet . - We read you , Commander . Punch in long range cameras . A mammoth spaceship . Heading right towards me . Tremendous velocity . I 'm taking evasive action . It 's dragging me towards it . Retrorockets ineffective . Why doesn 't he open fire ? If it 's strong enough to drag him towards it , it could be strong enough to stop his lasers . Eagle Four . Come in , Eagle Four . This is Main Mission . Do you copy ? - Eagle Four , come in . - There is no communication at all . I am getting nothing from the on-board instruments . Well , what do we do ? There 's a slim chance he may have survived , even within that other ship . - So we can 't attack . - What can we do ? Their technology is much more advanced than ours . Operation Shockwave , do we go on with it ? Ah , we must at least go on with the preparations . Okay . The planning meeting for Operation Shockwave is brought forward . We 'll start it right away in the Commander 's office . Keep calling , and if you hear anything - anything at all - let me know . Moonbase Alpha , do you read me ? Main Mission . This is Koenig . Do you read me ? Do you read me ? I have waited a long time to meet you , John Koenig . - Who are you ? - I am Arra ... - .. Queen of Aetheria . - Aetheria ? The planet whose course has so terrified you and your people . We have expected you for many millions of years . You see your destiny has always been our destiny . But .. how can that be possible ? It was only a matter of time before we met , John Koenig . It seems to me we are here by accident . Our Moon was blasted out of Earth 's orbit by a nuclear explosion . No one could have forseen that . Oh , poor John Koenig . How you belittle yourself in the scheme of things . And yet how small you are to be so great . I should very much like to know my place in the scheme of things . Our two planets have met in the body of Time ... .. for the great purpose of mutation . We shall change utterly ... .. and the change will reverberate ... .. through the galaxies and universes of eternity . You and I are two vital drops ... .. in the boundless ocean of Time . We have met with purpose . We must not fail our destiny . On this question of the destiny of Man . Please be more specific . What will happen to us ? You shall continue on ... Your odyssey shall know no end . You will prosper and increase in new worlds , new galaxies . You will populate the deepest reaches of space . And you ? Oh . The gene of which I and my people are a part ... .. shall mutate . We shall take on another form . Unrecognisable . Spiritual , if you like . But once changed ... .. we shall become immutable ... .. for time inconceivable . And what must I do to help you achieve all of this ? Nothing . I 'm afraid I 'm right . Whether intentionally or not ... .. the alien spaceship 's parked itself in the exact position ... where we plan to lay our mines and create shockwave . How much time do we have ? Well , the Cargo Eagles carrying the nuclear charges should be leaving now . Tanya . Give all cargo carrying Eagles lift off clearance . - Yes , Paul . - John is still inside that alien spaceship . There 's no need to state the obvious . Main Mission to all Cargo Eagles . Move towards the alien spaceship . Coordinates for the nuclear charges will be transmitted shortly . - No other way ? - Not that I know of . Your friends are dangerously concerned about you . They are making elaborate plans which could destroy this ship . - How can you know that ? - I can hear their thoughts and words . And the unthinking calculations of your computers . This activity must cease . They must do nothing . Are you asking me to tell them to do nothing ? How can I do that ? They 'll need facts , logical explanations , they 're all all of them , logical men and women . There is a way . If you come with me , Arra . You could help me to persuade them just by your presence . I cannot come with you . We both have our parts to play . Yours is to do nothing . I ... I have much to do . What you 've told me sounds magnificent here , in this chamber , and from your lips ... But how will it sound in the cold light of Moonbase Alpha ? They 'll never believe me . They already think I 'm suffering from radiation sickness . They simply will not believe me . That is the test of your command . Are you unfit to play the part ... .. for which you have been destined since the beginning of time ? - I have faith in you , John Koenig . - And I have faith in you . But what is faith against the fact of imminent collision ? I 'll need to know more . I 'll need to know what you are going to do . I go to shape the future of eternity . And I need your help . Arra ? I go to shape the future of eternity . And I need your help . Your help ... your help ... your help . Paul ! - Main Mission . Main Mission . This is Koenig . - We read you , Commander . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . Suspend all operations immediately . - Repeat , sir . - Repeat . Cancel Operation Shockwave . Pull those Eagles out of there . And most important , do nothing until I return . Repeat . - Nothing . Until I return . - Yes , sir . You don 't believe me . I know it 's incredible . But I trust her , I believe her ! Commander , the radiation cloud has cleared now . The readings we are getting are accurate . David has double checked them with the computer ... .. and the fact is we are going to collide with that planet in less than seven hours . Unless we let shockwave go ahead . The charges are in position , Commander . The countdown 's underway . - It would be madness to stop it . Is that what you want ? - Exactly . That 's what I want . - Then you are mad . - Paul ! Commander , it 's an open and shut case . We either make some attempt to save ourselves or we die . Anyway , what 's so different about this situation to any other danger we 've been in ? Arra . Then tell us what she 's going to do ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know ! Now look , Paul . There have been two constant factors in all the troubles we 've been through . One , we 've survived them all . Two , John Koenig has been commander throughout . Now I see no reason to doubt his command now . - But it 's absurd ... - Is it ? You didn 't see Arra . She has convinced John Koenig ... .. and as far as I 'm concerned I see no reason to doubt his command now . - It 's against every fact and calculation .. - Facts , calculations ... .. you 're beginning to talk like a computer . Hmm . Of course , reason and fact are against Arra . But then the commander 's case is not based on reason or fact . But on faith . - And I think we should have faith in him . - But you set up Operation Shockwave . Yes I did . And now I believe it should be cancelled . Paul , cancel Operation Shockwave . This meeting is closed . Paul . You 'll have to take over now . Radiation sickness . Hallucination , disorientation . Same symptoms as Carter 's . - Is it permanent damage ? - I don 't know . Alan is still affected . John 's going to have to be confined to his quarters ... - .. and mildly sedated . - Do we continue with Shockwave ? Countdown is six hours and thirty two minutes . - And you 'll look after John ? - Yeah . - Security . - Security . Identify . Doctor Russell . Have two guards report to me in Medical Centre immediately please . All generators are working at minimum capacity . Activate radiation shields to medium power . Technical Section . Seal all launch pads . Evacuate maintenance areas and decompress . Yes sir . Nuclear charges fused and ready to detonate . Your friends have betrayed you , John Koenig . Betrayed ? Computer , lock my door . Alan Carter . It is I , Arra . We need your help now . Arra . Arra . Doctor Mathias . Arra . She called . Where is she ? You saw her too ? Alan , I need your help . Here 's what I want you to do . Arming nuclear trigger . Two minutes fifty nine to detonation . No ! Gravitational pull increasing to strength four . Hold it ! Go on , move in there . Sandra . Tanya , get away from that button . Computer . Close and lock Main Mission doors . - Two minutes , thirty eight seconds . - Commander . Where is Arra ? She 's with her people , on the planet Aetheria . They 're waiting for our two worlds to touch . When that happens they 'll be transformed into a higher form of life . - Or death . - Now listen , you 've got to believe me . This is our only chance of survival . Operation Shockwave will destroy us ... .. unless we wait and do nothing ! - John . Give me the gun . - Helena . You tried to ignore and deceive me . But you couldn 't deceive Arra . Operation Shockwave will not take place ! Then we 'll die for certain . Gravitational pull increasing rapidly now . We must detonate . John . Please . Let me help you . You think I 'm suffering from radiation sickness , don 't you ? - Both you and Alan ... - It wasn 't radiation . Arra saved Alan . Just as she 'll save all of us . - John . Believe me . The medical facts ... - Helena . Why don 't you believe me ! ? Helena . If it 's a choice . Paul ! We 're all going to die in a minute . I 'll take my chances a few seconds early . Shoot me , if you choose . Helena ! No ! Please ! Trust me ! Trust me ! Too late ! Arra ! Arra , where are you ? Victor , I believed her ! Victor , I believed her ! Come on . Quick . Get those fires out . Sandra , Kano , keep monitoring . To your posts everyone . Attention all sections Alpha , report your damage . Technical Section , issue damage control equipment to all sections . Medical Section , prepare to receive casualties . John . I 'm sorry . You were right . Totally right . If you 'd done anything else I 'd want to know why . - But ... - But nothing . Helena . If you went out to that spaceship and came back with a crazy story like I did ... .. I 'd be a fool not to lock you up . How could anyone possibly know that ... That a planet on a collision course ... .. would not collide . But simply touch .

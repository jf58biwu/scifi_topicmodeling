 Guards ! Don 't speak or make a sound . My reflexes are dull . They almost fell over me before I heard them . I 've forgotten how useful telepathy is . - Oh , I must practice that , too . - No sign of him ? Just patrols , lots of them . - I think I 've found where he 's being kept . - Is it as we were told ? It 's certainly very strange , the weirdest prison I 've ever seen . Listen . Keep down . - What was it ? - I don 't know . But in the back position , that was Sarkoff , wasn 't it ? That was President Sarkoff , yes . Come on , let 's go . [ FAINT ELECTRONIC CHIRPING ] - Yes ? - I think we 've got some intruders . - Are you sure ? - Our electronic surveillance is usually reliable . Very reliable , yes . Last time it turned out to be a local rodent digging a hole under one of your listening devices . We spent two hours chasing our tails on that occasion . - That wasn 't our fault . - All right , give me the coordinates . - Five , one ... If they are there then they 've already penetrated two of our security perimeters . - Have you got them all ? - Yes . Sub commander Cheney to all units . This is a red alert . I repeat , this is a red alert . Electronic security reports intruders in Sector Three . All units are now on Red Standby . Out . At the double , move it . Thank you , Tyce . You may put the automobile under cover now . Don 't forget the base commander 's gift . Ah , yes , it was very courteous of the base commander , don 't you think , to spend part of his leave getting this , and then to bring it all the way from Earth ? - He values your friendship . - Yes , I think he does . And he 's a social climber . Probably works your name into every conversation . " My friend , ex President Sarkoff " . - Tyce , that is a most ill mannered remark . - It 's the truth . Civilisation has always depended on courtesy rather than truth . And I need civilisation . Now , more than ever . He looks older . He is older . It 's 7 years since he came into exile . Liberator . Come in , Liberator . - Liberator to spacecraft . Can you hear us ? - Looks like some sort of cruiser . - Not making much headway . - Blake to Liberator , do you read me ? - We read you . - Do you think he 's ready to come up ? We 've run into more security than we expected . It 's going to take longer . Listen , Blake , we 've got a problem . There 's an unidentified ship moving in on our position . Federation ? Zen says not , but Gan can 't make a voice contact . Seems to be closing in all the time . - Well , what do you want to do ? - Investigate . Be careful . We can handle things . If it turns out to be hostile , we 'll do a part orbit and lose it . We can 't just wait for it to close in . If you 've got to move off station , be as quick as you can , and don 't take any stupid risks . We 're taking enough of those down here . - Don 't worry . - I will if you 're not back in time to get us out . We 'll be here . - Good luck . - You too . - I don 't like the look of that . - Not again , Vila . - I 'm entitled to my opinion . It is your assumption that we are entitled to it as well that is irritating . What do you think ? As a matter of fact , I don 't like the look of it either . He agrees with me . The flight path is too erratic . - Makes it all seem worthwhile somehow . - It looks deliberate to me . It could be an injured pilot . It could be a trap . It 's not a very good one , then . We 're suspicious of it already . The test is not whether you are suspicious but whether you are caught . Then we 'll make sure we 're not . Vila , clear the neutron blasters for firing . Zen , put up the radiation flare shields . Confirmed . Keep trying to establish a voice contact . I 'll fly her on manual . If you 'll read the detectors and scanners ? - First sign of trouble , we get out , right ? - Goes without saying . I only wish it did . We attack the guards or climb ? There 's a door on the ground floor , it 's the only entrance . There is an open window round the back but it 's high up . We 've got to get onto that roof . - We climb . - We don 't want to risk raising an alarm . Come on . It 's not a burrowing rodent this time . Looks to be two intruders , two at least . Cheney to all units : Red Standby Alert is now Red Mobilisation . Repeat : Red Mobilisation . All units to move in on the residence . Liberator to spacecraft , Liberator to spacecraft . You 're closing too fast for me to get an accurate scan . - All right , I 'll reduce speed . - Thank you . - Liberator to spacecraft . Can you hear us ? - Blasters are ranged and ready to fire . No sign of any external damage . Carries no heavy armament . - I 'm getting a voice , very faint , lot of static . - Boost it to the main channel . Star Queen . General distress call , general distress call . This is the civilian cruiser Star Queen . If anyone can hear me , we need help . Please help us . General distress call , general distress call . Zen , are we in teleport range ? Liberator will be within teleport range of the civilian cruiser Star Queen in seven minutes . - Good . - No . - They need help ! - Do they ? Well , you heard him . - It 's not quite the same thing . - Avon 's right . We need more information . Let me go across and get it . If it is a trap . I 'll warn you . Then Vila can open fire . - With you on board ? - If necessary . - You feeling all right ? - Fine . You would give the instruction for your own death ; you expect us to believe that ? Yes . I expect you to believe that . Cover me whilst I climb , then hide the box . Blake ! A guard is coming ! You must get to Sarkoff . I will hide this one and then follow you . Come on , Gan . What 's taking so long ? [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] His time 's nearly up . Stand by to fire on that ship , Vila . I still don 't think this is such a good idea . I didn 't ask for your opinion . Are you standing by to fire ? - We don 't want to do anything hasty . - Vila ! Yes , I 'm standing by . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] This is Gan . It 's all right . You can bring me back across now . There 's no danger to us , but they need our help all right . I 've got all the details . Bring me back . Information : Analysis of voiceprint confirms that was not Olag Gan speaking . Avon ! Avon ! All right , bring him up . Avon ! Avon ! Avon ! Answer me ! Avon ! It 's not Gan ! Avon ? Jenna ? Now don 't let 's be silly . Answer me , one of you . I shall come out in a rash . Zen , has something happened to them ? Data is not available . I don 't want data ! I want to know what 's happening . It will be necessary for you to make a personal investigation . Oh , you 're a big help . " Personal investigation " " Personal investigation " The next time Avon wants to make a personal investigation on how you work . I shall make a personal point of handing him the instruments , personally . Beautiful , aren 't they ? Earth insects of the order Lepidoptera . - Butterflies . - Ah , so you 're an historian , are you ? No , but I did study some natural history . It 's interesting , isn 't it , that when that term " natural history " was originated , it referred to the study of living things . It was much later that it came to mean the study of things long since past and dead . History in its more conventional sense . - You don 't seem surprised to see me . - I 've been expecting you . Oh , not you , specifically , but someone . Do you know what this is ? Why are you expecting someone ? Assassination has always been a legitimate tool of statecraft . Its respectability and public acceptance has varied from civilisation to civilisation , but its practical application has remained remarkably consistent . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] - I ... - Echoes of a more civilised age . I didn 't come here to murder you . You know this is the finest private collection of Twentieth Century Earth objects anywhere in the galaxy . Even on Earth itself you would find no collection like it . This building is a replica of a typical residence of that period , set in an authentic Earth garden . I said , I 'm not a murderer . I 'm grateful for your semantic precision . Political assassination I can live with . To be murdered would be the final , sordid indignity . Now my educated friend , do you know what this is ? - Uh , it 's a projectile weapon . - It 's called a revolver . Explosive charge here , projectile emerges with great force and considerable accuracy , over short distances anyway . Primitive , but efficient enough for my purposes . President Sarkoff , I must speak with you . Will you listen to what I have to . [ CLICK ] EX president . I haven 't got time for the niceties of this game that you 're playing . - Just time for a hasty rationalisation . - I just want you to listen . I 've wasted my life listening . Listening to people who are arrogant , or vacuous , or just plain vicious . I smiled and acquiesced in the face of prejudice and stupidity . I 've tolerated mediocrity and accepted the tyranny of second class minds . But now all that is over . I am ready to die , here among the things I value . I am ready to let you kill me but I am not ready to listen to you justify the act . Quite still . - Very good . - I meant what I said Put those down , Tyce . I 'm afraid they do work . I said , put them down . I heard what you said I heard every feeble , self pitying word . Why should they send assassins for you , you 're already dead , Sarkoff . Before I kill you , who are you and what do you want ? I came here to take President Sarkoff back to his people . My name is Blake . Idiot , why didn 't you report this to me immediately ? You two , around the rear . I won 't do it . No , Blake , what you ask is impossible . It would be a mistake for me and the people of my planet . I am NOT the same man . - To them you are . - I am no longer a politician . But if I were , I would tell you that your timing is wrong , anyway . And if I were , I would tell you that if you wait any longer it will be too late . You don 't understand . - Blake ? - She 's with me . - I did tell you that . - Are there any more ? - No , just Cally . Something has alerted the guards . Are we safe in here ? Yes . But I 'll go and check . - Did you hide the box ? - Of course . Is he ready ? - Well , Cally . Must I listen to you , too ? - No - Have you no opinions ? - None . You are needed to unite your people . I see . Facts , not opinions . Would we have risked our lives for an opinion ? What do you think of my collection ? It is most impressive . " Impressive " , only ? Ah , but then your people don 't originate from Earth , do they ? My people are the Auronar . Yes , I remember in my last years of office , we received an ambassador from Auron . - His name was ... - Lehan . Yes , Lehan . I remember how alone he seemed . - He did not return to us . - Because he failed . - Because I failed him ? I wanted that alliance . - So did we . To resist the Federation . You seem to have shifted your ground somewhat since then . I was leader of the planetary government on Lindor for five years . During that period I resisted political pressure to join the Federation , even from factions within my own party . Eventually I decided to settle the issue by trying to get a vote of confidence . So I called elections . - And he was beaten . - Of course he was beaten . My friend , I was totally annihilated . Complete rejection . And no precise decisions followed my political disgrace . Lindor did not join the Federation . You see , it wasn 't a rejection of my policies . The vote was merely a rejection of me . So he ran away and hid . Here on this empty , nameless planet which the Federation so generously provided . - Together with a security force . - And you 're right , something has stirred them up . Since there 's nothing else that 's any threat to them , they must know you 're around here somewhere . I 'm afraid that Tyce has never been able to accept that I am no longer important It 's a very impressive bodyguard for someone who is no longer important . Courtesy . Besides it would be politically embarrassing for them if I were to be killed while I was their guest . Not unimportant , then . Not naïve , either . I mean , surely you must realise you 're a prisoner here ? Of course he does . Don 't you see it , Blake ? He relies on them keeping him here . - No , no that 's not true . - Blake , we 're running out of time . President Sarkoff , your planet is in total chaos . There are dozens of factions fighting for power . They 're on the brink of civil war . That cannot be true . I get regular reports . When the fighting starts , the Federation will move in a peacekeeping force . They 'll take over the government and your planet will have lost its freedom . Just swallowed up into the Federation . All quite legitimate and not a single voice raised in protest . That cannot happen . I know the situation on Lindor . I get regular reports . From the FEDERATION communications , yes ? Yes . But I have proof of their authenticity . The Lindor Strategy . That 's what they called it . It began with the rigged elections , which removed you from power and will only end when you return to your planet as the puppet leader of a subjugated people . - I knew ! - Nonsense . - No . We captured a Federation cipher machine . Now before they changed the code , we picked up a lot of information . Our computers have been unravelling it ever since . One of the things they came up with was the Lindor Strategy . We have checked . It is happening . - Why should I believe you ? - What have I got to gain by lying ? You are the only man who can reunite your planet . If you act now , you can save it from war and from the Federation . Well ? - He won 't go with you . - He must . - He was broken , can 't you see that ? If you 'd known him before , you 'd understand . He was a very special man . Brilliant and proud . Failure never occurred to him . - But the elections were rigged . - It was still failure . - That 's something you should understand . - I thought I could help him . - He must come with us , by force if necessary . - I know . You will take us both ? Put this on . And put one on him . I 'll go and check where the guards are . Liberator , are you back on station yet ? Respond , please . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Liberator , do you read me ? Respond , please . Liberator , do you read me ? What is this ? It 's a teleport device Lib ... - Something to do with getting me to your ship ? - Yes , when I can contact them . - Well , I shan 't need it I 'm not coming with you . - I 'm sorry . So am I. It 's too late , Blake , it 's been too long . Defeat has become a habit . Blake , if you ignite this it explodes . I thought it might be useful . The whole of the front is cordoned off and there are two men searching the woods at the back . - Looking for the missing guard . - Do you think they 'll find him ? - Well , I should think so . Very soon they 'll check in here , too . You two must go now while you still have a chance . - Liberator 's still not back on station . - Perhaps we 'd be safer on the move . - It depends how long they take to get back . - There is a place you could hide , safer than this . Deserted mine workings . - How far ? - About twenty miles . - That 's too far . - That vehicle you use . - The automobile ? - Yes . - Can you get to it without being seen ? - I think so . All right , come with me . Cally . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] - What are you planning to do ? - Escape . - I wish you hadn 't involved Tyce in whatever it is . - She is coming with us . - I should have realised . - Realised what ? - That Tyce wouldn 't stay with me , not now . - Does it make any difference ? - To my decision ? Of course not . - No , of course not . Right . Stay here , please . Where else would I go ? This is all I have left . The rear , quickly ! Right . Come on . You must come with us . No . [ SMASH ] - All of it . Piece by piece . - NO ! No , please . All right , I 'll come . Put that back on . [ ENGINE CUTS OUT ] The starting handle ! It 's a trick ! The front , they 're at the front ! You get back inside . Let me try . Hey ! Get out . Everybody get out . Cheney to all units : This is Blue Mobilisation , I repeat , this is Blue Mobilisation . Liberator , this is Blake . Do you read me ? Respond . Liberator , respond please . Liberator ! Do you read me ? Come in ! Liberator , we need teleport , now ! [ TELEPORT WHINE ] [ EXPLOSION ] - Where are they ? - I don 't know . - What is it ? Stay here with them , Cally . Wait here , please . Well , it 's faster than the automobile but not as amusing . Where are they , Zen ? Please specify question more precisely . The others . My crew . Where are they ? Their absence from the flight deck is the only data available . Thank you , Zen . Jenna ! Where are the others ? - They 're all dead . - Dead ? I still don 't know what happened there was a distress call . Yeah , but I mean how did all the ... ... what , are you all right - That was stupid . - None of us showed conspicuous intelligence on this occasion . Keep still . - Who are they ? - They 're Amagons . Amagons ? I thought smuggling was the Amagon speciality . It is , but they also manage a little robbery , piracy , murder . Anything to turn an honest profit . There . - This lot are headhunters . - I wish you wouldn 't call them that . Bounty hunters . They 're going to sell us to the Federation . - But how did they get on board ? - Gan ? It wasn 't Gan 's fault . They used me and a voice synthesiser . It was very well planned . Was Jenna behind it ? No . But when it was clear that we had lost , THAT is when she changed sides . Good to have you back with us , Jenna . - This is purely a business arrangement , Tarvin . - You weren 't always so cold . - You weren 't always a bounty hunter . - Have you forgotten Zolaf Four ? - Is it worth remembering ? - Just the two of us in the mountains . - And three hundred customs guards . - You saved my life . - We all make mistakes . - I thought you liked me . - Oh , I did . Then . - Have I changed so much ? One of us has . [ EXPLOSION ] - I just saved your pretty neck . - I didn 't like the price . You paid it . What 's Blake to you ? We 'd have got him anyway . I don 't think you would . You just made it easy for them . As betrayals go , it was really rather ordinary , wouldn 't you say ? - Jenna ! Stay here . - Don 't you trust me ? I trust you HERE . Then shut her up . Keep your woman quiet , or I 'll do it . Don 't presume on my gratitude too much , Tarvin . I wonder if there 's a price on your head anywhere ? No . But I imagine there is on yours , though . I 'd be ashamed if there weren 't . Computer , how long before we rendezvous with the Federation ships ? Two hours and seventeen minutes . - I can 't do it , Blake . - Keep trying . Look , there are two ways to set this thing off . One is that control box they all carry . Microwave transmitter . Just point it in the direction of the neckband and press the button . The other way is to force the lock . - You 're not going to force it , are you ? ! - And if I get it wrong , bang , no head . - I trust you . - And if it blows up and I 'm right behind you ! - That 's why I trust you . Computer , give me a visual . We ought to be in range by now . I suppose I can wait a bit longer . Tarvin , how much are the Federation paying you for this ? 13 million credits for the crew and ship intact . Or , 12 million if I don 't give them you . Supposing I made you a better offer ? You 're a pretty woman , Jenna , but not THAT pretty . - If you hand over this ship , you 'll lose a fortune . - Me ? How can I lose ? - Oh , I 'd expect a share . - Of what ? 300 million credits . Give or take the odd 10 million . You always did underestimate me , Jenna . It seems that now you take me for a fool . Oh , no I think you show great public spirit , giving up all that wealth just to bring Blake to justice . - You can prove what you say , of course ? - Of course . You mean it 's actually on the ship , this fortune of yours ? Naturally . Why else do you think that I 'd remain with Blake and his friends ? - Go with her . - No one is going with me . Do you think I should let you run around loose ? Now you take me for a fool . Do you think that I 'd show him where the money is ? Then stay here . I 'll be satisfied with 13 million credits . Or 12 million , if the fancy takes me and I decide to keep you . Very well . Come on . Information : Federation ships are now within scanner range . Where ? Yes . Look ! It 's almost done . Tarvin underestimates me . [ SMASH ] - I told you I couldn 't do it . - I believed you all along . - Nobody could open it . - I thought you could open anything , that 's always been one of your more modest claims . - I could open that door in two minutes . - This door is not quite the problem at the moment , is it ? - It seems to be a problem to you ! Keep your head , Vila ! That way I might have a chance at keeping mine . Yes . - Avon ? - What ? - Shut up . Please . - Blake is finished , I 'm afraid . - You really want to believe that , don 't you ? - I want you to recognise a fact . - Why ? - Because I 'm afraid for you . - Don 't be . - Accept it , Tyce , or it will destroy you . - You gave up . You were wrong . You are still wrong . - Tell me , Tarvin . You Amagons recognize facts . - You talk too much . Yes , it 's an occupational hazard , I 'm afraid . What then is your reality ? - Wealth . - Is that all ? - What else ? Well , as the rallying cry for a crusade , it lacks a certain inspiration . There 's my inspiration . The Federation are coming to me . I summoned them . I 'm going to sell them a crusader . - You 'd sell your grandmother , wouldn 't you ? - I did . She was going to sell me , I got in first . You ! Stop ! What are you doing here ? - Tarvin sent me to check on the others . - Why ? - Why don 't you go and ask him yourself . Well ? - I 'll come with you . Open it . Hello , Jenna . I 'm glad to see that you 're all behaving yourselves . Tarvin doesn 't want you damaged , unless necessary . We 're touched by his concern . It 'll be more impressive if he can hand you over alive . - A man who takes pride in his work . - What do you take pride in , Jenna ? - Survival . - At the expense of your friends ? - I didn 't know that you cared , Avon . - He didn 't . And he was right . Wait . Tarvin gets impatient . Shall I tell him that you delayed me ? - I 'll come with you and tell him myself . - Why ? - Move . - You 'll regret this . They 've gone . - I wouldn 't have thought it of Jenna . - I 'm still not sure that I believe it . What does she have to do to convince you Blake , personally blow your head off ? If this goes wrong she won 't get the chance . Something 's happened . I told you you 'd regret it . I wonder how long before they make contact with the Federation ? Soon . If I could just get close to some of them . The one called Tarvin , for example ? - Right . What 's that expression of yours ? - Companions for our death ? That 's a bit morbid , isn 't it ? I 've done it ! I 've done it ! - Gently , gently ! - Now that is genius - You could well be right . - You want more proof ? Excuse me . - It 's done . - Oh , yes ? Oh . Yes . Get down ! [ EXPLOSION ] No , you stay back . Keep out of sight . Get him in there . - Vila . - What ? - Take this off . - Well , that 's all very well , but who 's going to take mine off ? - Get on with it . Who 's going to take mine off ? And , Vila , do be quick . I 'll be next . Ahhh ! - Thank you . - Come on , we haven 't got much time . They 're almost here now . I must congratulate you , Tarvin . It looks as though you have accomplished what no one else has been able to do . You have taken Blake and his crew alive and his ship intact . - I will be a prince among my people . - Oh , at the very least . - Do not mock me , old man ! - Nothing was further from my mind . I welcome Blake 's capture . - Why ? What 's he done to you ? - He didn 't give up . He fought . Blake shamed him . - And in the end lost , it was inevitable . - Inevitable . I am the better man . - You ? Selfish , greedy , vicious ... - I WON . Yes , my dear , you see , it 's a paradox . He won because he is not the better man . - What ? ! - And yet by winning , he becomes a prince among people . - Among MY people . - Does it matter which people , Tarvin ? Do you care ? Tarvin calling Federation patrol . Do you read me ? Tarvin calling Federation patrol . Report . Tarvin calling . We will be at the rendezvous point in seven minutes . Request you have a boarding party standing by . Confirmed . Out . Jenna was obviously lying . 13 million credits , I think . - Turn the ship round , Tarvin . - Is that a weapon ? - Guess . Turn the ship round . - We 'll die together . - Be careful , Tyce ! - Leave it ! - You think I 'm afraid ? - No , but a dead prince , where 's the fun in that ? Sarkoff ! - Shoot him . - We don 't have a quarrel . Shoot him , now . Throw it away . You couldn 't kill me in time to save her . A reflex , a dying spasm , and she 's gone . Shoot him , father . You owe it to me . You owe it to our people . Put it down , Sarkoff , you can 't win . You haven 't got the will for it . - Do it ! - Tarvin . [ GUNSHOT ] - So it really means that much to you ? - Aren 't I President Sarkoff 's daughter ? Perhaps I just sounded as though I meant it . Then perhaps I 'd better sound as though I mean to be President Sarkoff . - The Amagon 's dead . - Take us out of here , Jenna . I should thank you , but I 'm not sure I have anything to be grateful for . - I have , and I do thank you . - But as I 'm supposed to be a politician , I will thank you anyway . - If ever you have need of our help again ... - I think you 've helped enough . Goodbye , Blake . - If you see Lehan ... - I have work for Lehan . He and I have an alliance to put together . Then tell him he can go home to Auron . - Goodbye , Jenna . - Goodbye . Goodbye , Blake . You 'll always be welcome on Lindor . - Yes , we may have need of 13 million credits . - Over my dead body . I hope you 're not going to make a habit of that particularthreat . Ready ! Would you move back , please ? Good luck . Goodbye , Blake . [ TELEPORT WHINE ] - I had the feeling she didn 't mean all of us . - Yes , I had that feeling . Well , don 't just stand there .

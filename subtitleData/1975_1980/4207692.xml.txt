 ( whirring sound overhead ) ( clucking ) ( neighing ) ( chickens clucking / cows mooing ) What is it ? What is that light ? I don 't know . ( banging ) You stay right here , Edna . Don 't leave the house . I 'm gonna take a look at it . Come on , Dutch . ( whimpers ) Chicken . Holy mackerel ! ( male voice ) This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship . Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship . Come in . Mother Ship . This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship . ( female voice ) This is Mother Ship . Have you completed emergency landing ? Affirmative . Mother . Request repair party . Negative . Zunar J5 . You 'll have to effect emergency repairs yourself . and rendezvous with us at grid dissect 8304 at 69 hours minus 17 . - That 's an awfully tight squeeze . - Unavoidable . Zunar . Next mission to this galaxy due in 115 . - Days ? - Years . Good luck . Zunar J5 . Over and out . Yeah . So long . Mother . ( whistles ) I don 't see any hammer and sickle , do you , Colonel ? Maybe it 's on the inside , General . No sign of life , either . Get me the Pentagon , red priority . I want to speak to the chiefs , Colonel . - Captain . - Sergeant . Yes , sir . Sequoia here . Come in , Rover . Rover ? Rover ? Rover ? Rover ? ( General ) Wipe it out of your minds . You 've seen nothing and heard nothing . - Yes , sir . - We 'll want them later . Take their names . Colonel . Captain . - Sergeant . - Yes , sir . - Names ? - Charlie Cooney . General Stilton ! We 're ready when you are , sir . - Bullhorn . - Yes , sir . On to Hopscotch . All right , men . Let 's move it ! - Let 's move out . Colonel . - Captain . - Sergeant . - Yes , sir . ( electronic beeping ) ( collar beeps ) ( General ) When we get to Hopscotch , I want mark-four priority security . Armor , personnel , guard dogs , the works . And not one word to public relations . Not one word . You got that , Colonel ? Yes , sir . You got that , Captain ? - Yes , sir . Sergeant ? - Got it . Well ? It 's a brilliant technological achievement . It 's state of the art . You trying to tell me something , Allison ? - It 's definitely not one of ours , General . - How about Russia ? Certainly not Russia . It 's far beyond ... OK , Allison . Lay it on the line . Whose is it ? I don 't know , General . We 'd better find out. i wanna know who made it , flew it and where it came from . - Colonel ? - Yes , sir . Contact SigCom on our radio . Get Hungerford at Air . Call Steinmetz at Johns Hopkins , Lasser , Billings , Cranhammer . - Get them IQs off their tennis courts . - Yes , sir . Double pronto ! If we don 't find out where that thing came from , this country could be in trouble , big , big trouble . - Colonel . - Captain . - Sergeant . - Yes , sir . You say it 's not man-made , Allison . What 's that leave us ? Outer space . With no sign of the pilot . Big , big trouble . While you and I are talking this very minute , some slimy green-headed 12-legged creep could be crawling into the White House . Big , big trouble . We 're up against genius . We 'd better come up with some genius of our own . ( man ) I believe , General , you 've already met my assistant , Dr. Corday . I 'd like to introduce some members of our team . Dr. Robeson of Caltech , who 's our expert on fossil fuel . Professor Hurakawa of Johns Hopkins . Dr. Elizabeth Bartlett , who heads Thermal . Huh . Dr. Norman Link , who 's been doing some intriguing work in garbage research . - So what ? - Dr. Link . Just a second , Dr. Heffel. I have to relay some vital information to a colleague . Oh , yes . This is our hard-water man , Dr. Leach . Right , Ernie . The Lakers by a point and a half for 100 bucks . When will you have the line on Philly and the New York Knicks ? ( Heffel ) I 'd like you to meet Mr. Jurist , who also is involved in Thermal . And there 's Dr. Banford , Professor Epstein , Doctors Davidson and Barrett . And , of course , this is Dr. Humphrey , our head of Nuclear . Mr. Stallwood , our head of Procurement and Supplies . What are you doing here ? When the call went out for an emergency meeting , I naturally assumed ... You assumed wrong . Scientists . Double-A clearance only . Out . - But I might have a contribution . - lf we need any pencils , I 'll send for you . - But , Dr. Heffel ... - Out . Sorry , General . Where was I ? Oh , yes . Professor ... Dr. Heffel , I didn 't come for a roll call , I came to pick brains . Are they all here ? - Yes . These are our top people . - Then let 's get to it ! I understand , General . Attention , everyone . ( Heffel ) Dr. Link . That 's it , Professor . I 'll call tomorrow with more input . Bye . All right , Sergeant . Open it . Drapes . Ladies and gentlemen , what you are about to see is top secret . The United States government will countenance no leaks . Now . What 's holding it up ? - Nothing . - It 's amazing . - Where did you get it ? - What is it ? ( man ) A propulsion unit of some sort , ladies and gentlemen . Never mind where we got it . We have other experts working on that . What we want to know from you is , what makes it tick ? OK . Let 's have your hypothesis . Uh , the energy source could be atomic . We 've checked on that . Negative . Direct conversion , utilizing thermionic ... - Checked out . Negative . - Oh . It 's not propelled by garbage , I know that . Jellyfish calling Olympus . Jellyfish calling Olympus . Come in , Olympus . Mr. Olympus ? This is Jellyfish . I think I 'm on to something very big and very ... Jellyfish . Your man in ERL ? Yes , sir . That Jellyfish . I think I 'm on to something . No , sir. I think you 'll find this a great deal more interesting than my last report . Right now , Dr. Heffel is in a secret meeting with a four-star general and a whole gaggle of scientists . What are they meeting about ? I don 't know , sir , it 's a secret . Get in there and find out ? Do any of you have a solid evaluation ? Not a guess , a solid premise ? Do you ? Well ? ( clears throat ) Do you think it might be fruitful to bring Dr. Wilson into this discussion , Dr. Heffel ? - Wilson ? - Yes . He might very well come up with an applicable theory . Don 't be ridiculous . - Who 's Dr. Wilson ? - He 's in my carpool . Oh ... That is , we live in the same building . - That certainly qualifies him . - Oh . No . What I 'm trying to say is , he 's a very bright young physicist who 's come here recently on loan from Caltech . A loan , I might add , that is bearing absolutely no interest . ( laughter ) He 's a little unorthodox , but a brilliant theorist . - General Stilton isn 't interested in ... - Get him . - What ? - Get him . His output couldn 't be any less than what we 've gotten so far . Yes , General . He really has an unusual mind . - Well , Dr. Wilson ? - It 's beautiful . Don 't you have any other observation ? - Only that it looks like an artichoke . - We know it looks like an artichoke . What makes it tick ? Mayonnaise ? Negative . No , I was only joking , sir . I do have a theory , sir , actually , in line with the work I 've been doing . I have a hunch it 's tapping the primal mainstream . The primal mainstream ? It 's everywhere , only on different frequencies . The whole electromagnetic spectrum - Cosmic , gamma , x-rays , ultraviolet , visible light , infrared , radio waves . Do you know how much we finite human beings can tune into with our senses ? Less than five percent . The universe makes its own energy . We even make it ourselves . Yes , take biofeedback , for instance . If I taped terminals to your head , General , your brain could run an electric train . - Electric train ? - ( Heffel ) I 'm sorry , General . Perhaps electric train wasn 't the most apt example . ( Heffel ) Thank you very much . - Let me have that for a couple of months ... - Thank you . A couple of months ? Dr. Heffel ? - Yes , General ? - l want action . ( bell rings ) You know , Drexel , I 've seen the most amazing thing . Amazing . But don 't ask me to tell you about it . It 's classified . ( bell rings ) Thank you , Drexel . Well . How did you get in here ? Huh ? Now look , you 're asking for trouble . Dr. Heffel isn 't too crazy about animals in the building . Fact is , he isn 't too crazy about people in the building either . What 's your name , huh ? Charlie ? Cuddles ? Jake ? Yes , yes . You look like Jake . That , Jake , is the Van Allen belt . Oil and coal is not going to do it , you know . And , one of these days , that sun of ours is going to turn into a big black hole . You know where it 's really at , Jake ? Electromagnetism . We 're loaded with it . You know , it 's crazy , but you almost look like you know what I 'm talking about . All right , give me a hand with this , Sergeant . Easy , easy . That 's it . Stallwood , administration emergency ! That 's some fancy collar you got there . Maybe I 'll take you home with me . My neighbor Liz has a cat named Lucybelle . She 's really cute . And the cat 's not bad either . Liz ! Hi . Ouch ! I 've ... - We were just talking about you . - Were you ? This is Jake . I 'm going to take him home with us . You won 't have to drive Professor Link and myself home tonight . - Heffel 's called a late meeting . - l can wait . That won 't be necessary . - How about a coffee ? - No . - Chocolate chip cookie ? - No . - Are you sore or something ? - Sore ? Sore ? - Whatever gave you that idea ? - What is it ? What did I do ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing . Mayonnaise ? Electric trains ? Well , now , look , really , all that ... that was just a joke , Doctor . Well , nobody laughed , especially the general . Has he had water ? - The general ? - The cat . Oh . Water ? Cats do get thirsty , you know . Do you have a bowl ? A bowl ? Right here , yes . Here . - Water ? - Yes , right , water . Look , Liz ... Dr. Bartlett . Just because some general lacks a sense of humor , that 's no reason ... - All I was trying to convey ... - I 'm really not interested , Doctor . Besides , I wasn 't trying to be funny . It 's just that the magnitude of what the general showed us just bowled me over . - it did ? - Oh , completely . - Black . - What ? - Didn 't you offer me a cup of coffee ? - Right . Check . Coming right up . I really don 't understand , that 's all . The man who wrote the article you did for The Scientific Quarterly ... - You read it ? - Well , of course. it was brilliant . I 've been wanting to tell you . We don 't get much chance to talk in the car pool , but I 've been following your work . - You have ? - Closely . It 's very impressive , very innovative , very attractive . I mean , it 's bound to attract attention . Oh , well , um , I am writing an article at the moment and I would love to have your criticism . Oh . Maybe at lunch or , even better , at dinner sometime ? - Yeah , I 'd like that . When ? - Tonight ? No , that 's right , you 've got that late meeting . That may not go all that late . I should be out by seven . Is that too late ? - Seven 's beautiful . - Good . Well ... Oh , thanks for the coffee . it was delicious . - l think she digs you . - l sure hope so . - Who said that ? - l did . Frank , we 'd better get down to business . Sit down . We 've gotta talk . I 'm running out of time , and you 're the only one I can depend on to help me . - It 's you ? - It 's not the mouse . Now , sit down . But your lips aren 't moving . You 're not speaking . Thought transference . Nothing exceptional where l come from . Now , sit . My name is Zunar J5 / 9 Doric 4-7 . Zunar ... ? Why don 't we just stay with Jake , OK ? Frank , last night at 03 hours plus 13 , I made an emergency landing in a spaceship from another galaxy . That so-called artichoke ... it 's from my craft . But ... you 're a cat . Granted . But you see , in our civilization , that 's as far as we needed to evolve . We developed our brain to a fine point . Now , man rose off his four legs and developed tools , machinery , agriculture and a chronic pain in his lower back . We developed tools for the mind . This collar here , it amplifies brain power . - it does what ? - Well , it provides energy by which we ... Look , let me give you a demonstration . ( cello music ) - ( flute plays ) - Not a bad little tune . ( humming along ) Mm-mmm . Frank , this is really delicious . What is it ? Oh , it 's chopped kidney . It 's all they had at the deli . it really hits the spot . I 'm gonna take a couple of cases for my trip back . Sure beats the blah I 've been eating . Well , now back to my problem . Frank , I need an answer . - What do you say ? - Say about what ? Can I count on you to help me repair my spaceship ? - Why me ? - Because I like the way you think . Your equations rather interest me . In fact , they 're really not bad at all ... for a human . - Really ? I 'm on the right track ? - Quite definitely , but years away from a solution . Frank , on my planet , we have an expression - you rub my fur , I 'll rub yours . How would you like to make a quantum jump ? You help me , and I 'll give you a push in the right direction . - You 're serious ? - I 'm serious . - You really are from outer space ? - l am from outer space . - Even though you 're a cat ? - Frank ! Is it a deal ? It 's a deal . Oh , that 's ... We better move . I 've got to make repairs to my ship by 5 : 13 Sunday for liftoff , or I 'll miss the rendezvous with the mother ship . Right . I 'll get my sweater . Uh , do you think that you can find your way back to that airport ? No problem . I made a memory imprint . - With the collar ? - Right . Fantastic . How developed does your brain have to be to use that collar ? Not very . In fact , you could handle it . You wanna try ? Do we have time ? Why not ? Look , just grab hold of it . Easy . Don 't take it off . Without it , I 'm just an average cat . Right . - Right . OK ? - OK . - Now just concentrate . - Concentrate . Think levitation . Levitation . You 're as light as a feather . Look at me . I 'm floating ! It 's just plain incredible ! - Look , one hand . - You 're losing your concentration . Yeah . Hi , Frank . Gotta use your set . ( commentator ) The ball goes crosscourt to Brown . He brings it ... - What were you doing up in the air ? - Uh ... - Astronaut exercises . - Oh . - Link , I 'm busy . - Yeah . Well , just forget I 'm here . The last minute of the game , and Francine throws me out of the apartment . Why does she throw me out ? For one lousy cigar burn on the chair . - When did you get a cat ? - Jake 's not my cat . He 's just visiting . - Hi , Jake . - I 'm gonna have to ask you to leave . Do you mind , Frank ? Remember. the score 's tied at 108 . Atlanta has the ball and a basket could win it . Win it ? Oh , man ! And I gave a point and a half . There goes my 100 bucks . Come on , defense . Come on , guys . Man to man , we 'll ... The crowd is really on its feet now . The guy in the corner . He 's alone and closely guarded by King . King steals the ball . What a play . Here come the Lakers . Five seconds left . Puts up a shot . But a prayer. there 's no chance . Wait ... Wait a minute . Wait a minute ! I don 't believe it . He scores ! He made it in the last second . and the Lakers will win it by two . Unbelievable ! Frank , did you see that ? Yeah . I 'm really gonna have to ask you to leave . - l could use another beer . - I 'm out of beer , I 'm sorry . - How about a ginger ale ? - I 'm out of that , too . - Could I at least finish my cigar ? - Link , please . I 'd like to have a little celebration . I 'll see you later . The basketball game ? You did that ? Any friend of yours is a friend of mine . it was the fastest way to get rid of that flake . Let 's go . It 's less than 36 hours to liftoff . Right . Oh ... Do you think I ought to carry you , so people don 't suspect you 're not an ordinary cat ? Good thinking , Frank . Besides , my left paw 's been acting up again . - An old football injury ? - Actually , no . Polo . Now let 's go . What about getting into Hopscotch ? It 'll be guarded . - I 'll handle that , too . - It 's fantastic . Hi . Hi , this is Lucybelle . What 'd you say you call him ? - Jake . - Jake , right . Jake , this is Lucybelle . I thought they could get acquainted while we 're at dinner . - At dinner ? - Yeah . it was tonight , wasn 't it ? Right . Right , yes . I was just about to call you . Something came up . I 'm afraid you 're going to have to give me a rain check . Oh . Oh , well , of course . it really doesn 't matter . But it does . it matters a lot , Liz . Dr. Bartlett . You see , what happened was ... ( Jake sneezing ) It 's Jake . He took sick . Suddenly . Out of the blue . Really ? What is it ? I think it 's , uh , Tasmanian Croup . ( sneezing ) You poor thing . You know , he sounds terrible . You 'd better not let her get too close . Stop milking it . - What ? - l said I was about to rush him to the vet 's . The vet . That 's a good idea , Frank . D 'you know there 's a very good vet who lives in the building ? A Dr. Wenger . He specializes in cats . I 'm sure he 'd be glad to take a look at him . Jake prefers a general practitioner . I 'm sorry about dinner . I 'll make it up to you . - How about a picnic ? - Tomorrow ? - You handled that very well . - l didn 't enjoy lying to Liz . She 's a very unusual person . - Her kitty-cat 's not too bad either . - There 's plenty of time for that . That 's all right for you to say . But I 've been confined to a spaceship for five months . Ohh ... ( vehicle approaches ) - ( Jake ) The ship 's in that big hangar . - Oh . There 's got to be a way in . - It 's locked . - No problem . - Come on , come on . - Right , right . The coast is clear . Let 's go ! There she is . Somebody 's coming . - Somebody 's coming , Frank ! - l know , I know . What 's happening ? It 's all clear . - Let 's go ! - It 's this way . ( dog growls ) ( barks ) Forget it. it wears off in 20 minutes . He won 't remember a thing . Come on , let 's go . Incredible . An older model , but in pretty good shape for a rig with nearly a trillion miles on it . Now let 's see about getting it operational again . We 've only got 34 hours left . Right . Through here ? Hm-hm . Put me down . Oh , it 's just incredible . The artichoke . I was right . - What 's this ... control panel ? - Uh-huh . Sort of . - And this ? - Uh , computer . - Then this must be the readout . - Frank , later . I 'll explain it all later , I promise . - First , disengage the transducer system . - How ? Take that neo-mag intercog , and you 'll find the transducer switch on top of the ship . Just coordinate with me . Well , how do I get up there ? - Fly . - Fly ? You mean use your collar ? Don 't be ridiculous . We carry a spare . Concentrate , and when you get on top , engage the switch with the intercog and thought-project " seven max triad . " - Seven max triad . - Right . The computer will do the rest . Seven max triad . Right . Hey ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Hey , Frank , what are you doing up there ? What about the intercog ? Frank ? Jake , I 'm ready to plug it in . Right . Go ahead . - It 's in . - OK . Thought-project . Seven max triad . OK , Frank . Come on down . Amazing . I was afraid of that . The focal terminal on the microtransformer 's vaporized . - You 're sure ? - Positive . But I 'll double-check . - Just what I thought . - That 's where the focal terminal goes ? Acts as a catalyzer . I 'll need a small amount of org 12 . - What 's org 12 ? - What the focal terminal 's made of . About six cubits ought to be enough . You don 't have org 12 on this planet ? Never heard of it . Is it like mayonnaise ? You probably call it by a different name . Stand back . I 'll run it through the computer . ( horn honks ) Hey , Tom ! You all right ? Tom ! Org 12 ... ductile yellow metallic element . Melting point - 1.063 . Tensile strength - 19.000 . - Tensile strength what ? - 19.000 . Atomic weight - 196.967 . Wait a minute . That 's the atomic weight of gold . Wow ! ( alarm blaring. bell ringing ) ( soldier ) Out ! Out ! Everybody out ! What is that ? Come on , let 's go . Follow me ! Holy cow . - Give my collar room . - You can 't zap the whole base . Let 's get out of here . Over here ! Follow me ! Move out ! Watch it ! Come back here ! ( Jake ) Where are you going ? Come out of there . You 're under arrest ! Look out ! - ( meowing ) - What is it ? Get it off of me ! Get it off ! ( soldier ) Was anybody in there ? Back it out . Look out . Who 's driving ? Corporal of the guard ! Corporal of the guard ! - Yes , sir ? - Who sounded that alarm ? I did , sir . We have an intruder , and his cat . Cat ? Cat ? Cat ? Yes , sir . Here 's his collar . Jake ! Excuse me . - Jake , are you all right ? - Frank , shut up and move this thing . - That 's him , sir ! - Halt ! Get that thing out of here ! Get it out ! Move it out ! Whoa ! - Now what do we do ? - Now you hang on . ( Frank ) 17 times ... Um , five of ... Now cosine of ... Yeah . Uh ... This is even better than the stuff I had last night . What 's it called ? - Tuna . - Tuna ? Love it . - it doesn 't make any sense . - What doesn 't ? According to your figures , we 're going to need $ 120,000 worth of gold . - So ? - So ? Jake , forgetting the money , which I can 't forget , you know how much gold that is ? It 's that much . And you want to put it in a space that big ? You folks are still operating on the bulk system . I 'll reduce it to the size I need and still retain all its properties . - How ? - I 'll get into that later . First buy the gold . Buy it ? Jake , in order to buy $ 120,000 's worth of gold , you need $ 120,000 . - So ? Is that a problem ? - A prob ... ? My entire capital is tied up in my next paycheck . - Then what 's the alternative ? - l don 't know what ... Hi . - Traditionally known in horse racing ... - Oh , boy . - What are you doing ? - Borrowing your TV . Just bring me a beer and forget I 'm here . Hi , Jake . Link ... Wife 's worked out an equitable TV schedule . The Peachtree Derby and the football game 's on your set , and the opera on mine . - Can 't you see I 'm busy ? - Doing what ... playing with your pussycat ? - Link ... - Franklin , please . I 've got a bundle bet on the Peachtree . ( softly ) We 've got problems to solve , things to do . What ? - Link , I 'm gonna have to ask you ... - Sshh ! They 're at the post . You want a peanut ? No . - Come on , Sweet Jake . Let 's go . - Sweet Jake ? Yeah . It 's a hunch bet . 100 on the nose at 15 to 1 . I tell you , if she comes in , tiger , and I 'm gonna be 1500 in front , and you 'll be licking mackerel fillet . Did you forget my beer or did I drink it already ? Never mind , I 'll get it . - I 'll try to get rid of him . - ( softly ) Wait a minute . Did you hear what he said ? If Sweet Jake finishes first , he wins $ 1500 . - So ? - So if Link can win $ 1500 , why can 't we win 120,000 ? No . Wait a minute . He just made a bet . He could win 1500. it doesn 't mean he will . With me on his side , he will . - Did you say something ? - Hmm ? No , nothing . OK , OK . Let 's pipe down . I got 100 big ones riding on this nag . And they 're off . It 's Denny 's Doll breaking on top . Attaboy Star . Daddy 's Poppa on the outside . - Booky Baby on the rail and ... - Where 's Sweet Jake ? Sweet Jake is still in the gate . At the clubhouse turn. it 's Denny 's Doll by half a length . Attaboy Star . Sweet Jake is finally out of the gate . Sweet Jake is moving . He 's way behind. but he 's moving . Uh-oh . I think he stopped to have lunch . I don 't believe this . Eat on your own time ! See what I mean ? Sweet Jake ! I should have bet on the Metropolitan Opera . It 's Attaboy Star by a length . Booky Baby . Denny 's Doll and Seabottom . Sweet Jake 's finished eating and started running . And. ladies and gentlemen. is he running . But not even Silky Sullivan could come from this far behind . It 's Booky Baby taking the lead . Daddy 's Poppa moving into second . Attaboy Star . And making up incredible ground is Sweet Jake . I have never seen anything like this . But can he catch the pack ? At the top of the stretch. it 's Booky Baby in the lead . Daddy 's Poppa . And turning for home. it 's Sweet Jake . Come on , Jake . Come on . Give him the whip , dummy . Attaboy . Here we go . Come on . Come on . Come on , Jake . Attaway . Come on , Jake . Come on . Come on , boy ! That 's it ! Hot dog ! We got it ! Yahoo ! Yeeha ! The story here today . ladies and gentlemen. is Sweet Jake . 1500 smackeroos ! That calls for another beer . - How about you ? I 'm buying . - No , thanks . Oh , incidentally , Frank , you could use another six-pack . I got a feeling I 'm gonna murder them on the football games . Frank , that 's the solution to the money . - No , no . It 's ridiculous. it won 't work . - Why won 't it ? I don 't know anything about placing a bet . I wouldn 't know where to go , what to do . I gotta call Ernie with my football bets . The Rams-Patriot game starts in 25 minutes . - We 'll have to take in another partner . - Who ? - Him . - Did you say something , Frank ? - Link ? Do you think that 's wise ? - What 's wise ? Who are you talking to ? Ask how many football games we can bet on . - Who are you talking to ? - Ask him ! - It 's crazy . - Buddy ? - Who ? - How many football games on TV today ? Three pro games . East , Midwest , Far West . Who ? - Brief him . - Have you got a tape machine going ? I don 't think it 's a good idea , but OK . You know , I 'd say you were talking to the cat . I was . Right . Look , Frank , this can happen to anybody in government service . That 's why they have staff psychiatrists . - Link . Take a deep breath . - OK . - Remember that artichoke ? - Uh-huh . Well , it all started when this spaceship ... - Spaceship ? - ... from another galaxy landed in a field . Frank , let me get this straight , OK ? Now , you 're trying to tell me that your little pussycat came from another planet from another galaxy in a spacecraft and landed on Earth ? - Is that it ? - That 's right . - You 're squeezing . - See ? You heard him talk . Uh-huh . Look . I mean , I don 't know how you 're doing your little trick , you know . But I gotta tell you something , it 's dumb . Very dumb . You know what I 'm gonna do ? I 'm gonna drink your last beer , watch three football games on your television set , and then I 'm going home , because this is dumb , Frank . Real dumb . Now , that 's dumb . Aw , Link , look . Listen to me for one minute . I don 't want to hear it , Frank . I don 't want to hear it , Frank ! - OK ? - OK . Thank you . That does it , Frank ! I 'm going home and watch the Metropolitan Opera . Oh , now , Link . We need your help . Jake needs your help ! I don 't want to hear about it ! You 're the only person I know who knows how to place a bet. I don 't anything about ... What kind of a spaceship ? You 're beautiful . ( phone rings ) You 're down 200 , sucker . Would you like to double it ? Earnest Ernie 's Sporting Club . Weasel speaking . What 's your pleasure ? Yeah . Give me four balls . I 'll double it . - What do you say , Sarasota Slim ? - l say give him five . The man says give him five . You got it . Honest Harry holds . Link , can you make it fast ? We got a hot one on the rotisserie . - Can I trust him ? - Would a crook be named Honest Harry ? You wanna bet what ? Hold on . - Hey , Ernie . Ernie , come here . - Yeah . Link wants to take his winnings from Sweet Jake and parlay the three football games . You 're kidding ? A three-game parlay ? Yeah . It 'll come to 120 G 's if he makes it . It 's like taking candy from a baby , Weasel . - He 's down . - You 're down . ( man ) Hold it right there . General ? General ? Fingerprints , sir . They found fingerprints . On top of the hull , inside the cabin . And they are the prints of a human being . So whatever power brought this ship here was aided by some disloyal American . Gentlemen , we are dealing with a collaborator . I want the face that matches these prints . Use the computer . - Double pronto , sir . - General ! General ! - Look at this . They found more . - What in blazes is that ? Fine hair , sir . The pilot was wearing a fur coat . Even more important , we found tiny prints in a claw-like pattern , like a pussycat 's . Pussycat ? Why aren 't I hearing some tickety-tacks ? What about the fingerprints ? - There 's a printout about to come through . - Sir . What do you want me to do with this ? - Get it checked , sir . - Coming through , sir . ( Stilton ) " ID - Wilson , Frank . Doctor . Social Security , 631-07-0829 . " " 1951 to ' 55 . US Navy .

( football commentary on TV ) - Want a peanut , Jake ? - No , thanks . I 'll wait till Frank gets back . - The Rams still ahead ? - Ahead ? The Rams won the game . And without Jake 's help . Without your help , buddy . Let 's open the six-pack . What will you have , Jake ? - Did you get some more of that tuna ? - Yeah , yeah . Coming right up . ( TV ) There 's the two-minute warning .

What 's hyperzemia ? - It 's what Jake 's got . - What did your doctor do for him ? - Gave him two aspirin . - Two aspirin ? - What 's that ? What 's happening , Frank ? - l don 't know . Two aspirin . No wonder you 're feeling worse . - How did he get the ball ? - Interception . - What this cat needs is some expert help . - Get him . - Dr. Wenger . - Get him . OK . I 'll go get him . I 'll be right back . ( Frank ) Get him . Somebody tackle him . - Hi , sweetie . Can I get you anything ? - ( Link ) OK . Out of bounds on the 30 . Jake , why didn 't you do something ? And spoil everybody 's fun ? Look , guys , there 's plenty of time . You 've got terrific whiskers . Jake , will you pay attention ? They 're within field-goal range. lf they make it , we 're sunk . No problem . Believe me . A little tuna , sweetheart ? Oh , Jake , concentrate , please . The next few seconds could be crucial . - Time out . - ( Liz ) I appreciate it , Doctor . At least you could have waited till the game was over. I have $ 10 on Chicago . - You 've got it on . What 's happening ? - Time out . This is Dr. Wenger . Dr. Wenger , here 's the patient . I definitely think he needs your attention . All right . - How did they get to the 30 ? - ( Link ) Interception . - Happened while we were in the elevator . - ( TV ) ... or a field goal ? ( Liz ) What do you think ? - l think they should try for a field goal . - About the cat . Hmm ? Oh , he 's tense , he 's very tense . The shoulder muscles are all bunched up . - Where do you want to examine him ? - Right here will be fine . OK . Let me get this out of the way . Also , let 's , first thing , get this collar off . Hey ! Good thinking , Chicago . ( TV ) This year. he 's never missed inside the 35-yard line . - Get through that line now . - That guy can 't kick a ball 60 yards . - Block that kick . Block that kick . - ( meowing ) Will you calm down now ? Hold the cat , please . Jake , you better do something . - Where 's his collar ? - Block that ... - It 's right here , Frank . - Huh ? - Give it to me , Liz . Give it to me . - Frank , I 'm just gonna hold the ... - I 'm gonna give him a sedative . - No , don 't do that ! Frank , let go of the cat . There 's the snap . It 's down . The kick is up . It 's long enough . It 's straight enough . It 's ... It 's ... It 's flat ! I 've never seen anything like it . The ball flattened out in midair . There 's the gun . - Jake ? - The Oilers have won it 21 - 19 . I told you not to do that ! I only came here as a favor to a neighbor . As a rule , I do not make house calls . You sure picked a dumb time to break your rule . Dr. Link ! Look , Dr. Wenger , please forgive him . He 's a new cat-owner . Jake . Jake , it 's me , Jake . Oh , Frank , we 're finished . He 's blotto . Well , look on the bright side . San Diego could still win . Yeah , and San Diego could still lose . And where does that leave this poor little guy ? He 's blown his rendezvous and my 1500 clams . That was very rude , Frank . - Liz , butt out . - What ? - Cancel the bet . Call Ernie . - He 'll never buy it . - Look , what 's going on here ? - Jake , we got problems . Speak to me . Is everybody crazy ? The line is busy . We 'll never get through . He 's taking bets . - We 'd better get down there . - Like yesterday . Just a minute , Frank . I would like ... No , I demand an explanation . What 's going on ? - Later , Liz . - No . Now . We have got exactly six minutes before that game starts . - Watch it , Link . I 'm a black belt . - OK . We 'll tell you in the elevator . Remember that meeting we had with Dr. Heffel and General Stilton at the ERL ? ( Liz ) Outer space ? - Frank Wilson , are you putting me on ? - No , no . Remember that artichoke ? Dydee One calling Hopscotch . Come in , Big Cheese . This is Big Cheese . Go ahead , Dydee One . Do you still have contact with the subject ? Yes , sir . Also that garbage expert and the dame from the car pool . And they 're all going into Earnest Ernie 's pool hall . Looks like a Mafia tie-in . Mafia ? What kind of an operation you running down there , Heffel ? Lucky ! ( laughs ) Really lucky . Ernie ? Ernie ? Excuse me . Ernie ? - Hi , Ernie . - Well , look who 's here . Hiya , Doc . Uh , Ernie , I wanna cancel my Chargers bet . - You wanna cancel your Chargers bet ? - Yeah , cancel my Chargers bet . Really ? Why ? Oh , I don 't know . Just a hunch , sort of . Hey , not a bad hunch . The Chargers are ten points behind . - Already ? - ( cheering ) 16 , boss , 16 . Steelers just scored another one . Sorry , Doc . Is he taking a nap ? - Yeah . - Is that TV picture still out ? Well , there goes 120,000 . 1500 of which is mine . - Isn 't there anything you can do ? - Not while Jake is out . Jake , wake up . - Is he breathing ? - He 's snoring . OK . OK . Isn 't there anything else we can bet on ? Yeah . Maybe we could get lucky . Another football game ? - Next Sunday . - Basketball ? - Tuesday night . - Hockey ? - Hockey ? - Hockey . Ernie , is there a hockey game today that we could put a few bucks on ? Sorry . Horse race ? Boxing ? - Demolition derby ? Anything to get even . - No . But if you want a little action , there 's always my good friend Sarasota Slim . - Sarasota Slim ? - Yes . He indulges occasionally in a friendly pool game with a slight wager on the side . - Nothing doing . - Why not ? - He 's a hustler . - Who isn 't ? OK . It 's a bet . What are the odds ? You against Sarasota Slim ? - Right . - Frank . Because I want to give you a chance to break even and because I like your style , let 's say 8 to 1 . That 's all ? What about him ? - Me ? - Link ? Well , considering the shape he 's in , I 'd say maybe 10 to 1 . - Ohh . What about the lady ? - Me ? - Liz ? - Considering the shape she 's in , 20 to 1 . - OK . You got a bet . - Frank ! Arch , set ' em up . Another sucker just swam into the net . Frank , I don 't know anything about this game . Are you bananas ? That guy can make a pool ball sit up and do the boogaloo . I know , but I 've got the equalizer ... the collar . - How are you gonna do that ? Jake 's out . - I 've used it , to repair the spaceship . - You ? - Yes . I 've flown . Charlie , give me the special , and heavy on the onions . - Taking a nap ? - Yeah . Throw in a few chili peppers , huh ? - Frank , I don 't want to take the risk ... - Liz , you 've got to do it . I 'm desperate . No money , no gold . No gold , no liftoff . But ... ( clears throat ) But if we deliver , look what we get in return ... the solution to half the problems on this planet . - Just show me how to hold the pole . - Good girl . We need a stake . I 've got about 12 bucks . It 's in my hip pocket . Will you get it for me ? - OK , that 's 12 . How much do you have ? - Me ? I think I got 20 . - 20 ? Liz ? - Uh ... - l just have my mad money . - Give it to us . Please ? Come on . Boy , when this dame gets mad , she gets mad . I was going to buy a whole spring wardrobe , Link . - OK . Ernie . - Boss , here 's the bankroll . - Ernie , we bet 300 at 20 to 1 . - Check . Not in your lifetime , Ernie . Honest Harry holds . All right , you want Honest Harry , you got Honest Harry . 300 at 20 to 1 . That 's 6,000 clams . And here 's our 300 . Earnest Ernie , 6,000 . The mark , 300 . 6300 . And may the best man win . Or woman , as the case may be . Young lady , it 's your break . Come on , don 't be so stingy with the onions . Here , take the collar , Liz . OK , here . Link , keep your eye on him . If he blinks just once ... Miss ? Do you mind ? We 're waiting . - Now , that 's a sandwich . Right ? - ( sniffs ) Right . - Taking a nap . - Naturally . Nice break , young lady . Very nice . Unfortunately , you didn 't sink anything , - but there 's always tomorrow . - ( laughter ) Show her how to do it . OK , Slim , go get her . Ooh , I can 't watch this . ( laughs ) - Frank , I 'm sorry . - No , it 's not your fault . ( ball pockets. applause ) ( ball pockets. applause ) ( man ) Attaway , Slim . Attaway , baby . I guess we are licked . If only Jake hadn 't got knocked out ... ( whispers ) Frank ! Frank , look . Jake ! Jake ? Frank , he must have just woke up . - Jake , are you all right ? - Yeah . Where am I ? What happened ? I 'm Liz Bartlett . I 'm responsible for your being ... - Liz , Liz , sshh . - Oh , well . Jake , we have got to win this pool game . That 's money in the bank . Look at it ! Honest Harry , guess who 's here ? Ernie ? Here 's our last 60 bucks . What are the odds now ? I 'm sorry. I can 't do it . - No bet . - No bet ? It 's part of my code of ethics . Always leave the sucker rent money . That 's not fair ! Honest Harry ? If the mark wants to go complete top city , he 's got a constitutional right . And I stand on it . The odds , Ernie ? It 's ridiculous . But if I didn 't have no principles , I 'd say 100 to 1 . Suppose ... Suppose she gives Sarasota Slim 12 balls ? What a sense of humor ! 300 to 1 . - And the break . - The break ? 500 to 1 . And blindfolded . - What ? - Blindfolded ! - 2,000 to 1 . - You 're on . $ 60 at 2,000 to 1 . Wait a minute . Wait a minute ! Are you seriously serious ? - You 're not thinking of welching , are you ? - But I thought you was putting me on . Earnest Ernie , it would not do your reputation any credit if word was to circulate that you reneged on a wager duly offered and accepted . - Get the big bundle , Weasel . - But , boss ... Get it ! All right . Let me understand this . Slim gets 12 balls and the break ? - And she shoots blindfolded . - ( laughs ) She 'll never get to the table . 120 Gs , boss . Don 't put it away , Honest Harry , you ain 't gonna hold it long . All right , Slim . Show ' em no mercy . Nice . Nice break , Slim . Unfortunately , you didn 't sink nothing , but there 's always tomorrow . - l believe I 'm up . - Hold it . Blindfolded . Oh . Could you back off ? ( applause ) You did it , Jake . You did it . - Thank you , sir . - Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . it was really nothing . Thank you . Frank , we won ! Thank you . Thank you . Thanks , all of you . Thank you . I 'm sorry about things being upside down , but I took these pictures at risk of life and limb . There 's the cat , sir . Notice his collar ? Well , well . What did you think of it , Mr. Olympus ? It 's just mind-boggling , isn 't it ? I mean , it boggled my mind . Did it boggle yours , sir ? Thank you , Omar . Yes , Mr. Stallwood , you are quite correct . it is " mind-boggling , " as you so graphically put it . The possibilities are infinite . A revolution in transportation , space exploration , colonizing the planets . The man who owns the secret of this device could control ... The world , sir ? The universe . Oh , my ! Well , then , sir , I don 't suppose it would be out of place to suggest a bonus . - A bonus ? - A small bonus . Mr. Stallwood , if I gain the secret of that device , you may well become a very rich man . I may ? Oh , sir , I ... really may ? Omar , prepare the copter . We leave at once . I must have that collar . I will have that collar . OK . All set , General . - Is it programmed ? - All the pertinent information fed in . - Everything we know . - Question number one , sir . Question number one . Who is the pilot ? it is a pussycat ! This machine is having a nervous breakdown . Get on the ball , young man . Feed that information through again . Reassess . Yes , sir . - General Stilton , sir . - What is it , Sergeant ? That purchase Dr. Link made ... we checked it out . It 's a large quantity of gold . - Gold ? - Yes , sir . It 's a Machiavellian conspiracy . Radio . This is Big Cheese calling Dydee One . Where are you , Dydee One ? Outside the suspect 's apartment . Don 't let them out of your sight . Another printout , General . Of all the ... Wait a minute . Radio . - Dydee One . - Yes , sir . - Didn 't they carry a cat into that pool hall ? - Yes , sir , they did . Gentlemen , it 's time to move in . - Colonel . - Captain . $ 120,000 in one lump sum . Jake , how 'd you like to hang around and watch me parlay this into a fortune ? - l wish I could hang around . - I 'm sorry , Jake . The time ? Huh ? Oh , yeah . Sorry , Lucy . - l guess I 'd better reduce the gold . - Reduce it ? - What are you talking about ? - It 's a new concept in calculating mass . On Jake 's planet , they use a system based on content , rather than on the quantitative ... Frank ! You 've got a whole lifetime to explain that . I 've got less than an hour . Now , stand back , everybody . - All right , don 't move ! All hands in the air ! - What are you doing ? - Dr. Frank Wilson ? - You can 't butt in here ! - Dr. Frank Wilson , you are under arrest . - And the pussycat , General . And the pussycat . - Read them their rights , Colonel . - Captain ? - Sergeant ? - Never mind . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law . You have the right ... - Good heavens . - Frank ... - What happened ? - ( Frank ) They 're frozen . Holy mackerel ! Now they 're on to us , how are we to get into Hopscotch ? You can 't zap the whole base . - Yeah , well , I 'll think of something . - They 'll probably be on alert . First things first . Let 's get this gold reduced , then we 'll worry about getting on the base . Now stand back . OK . Here goes . Ohh . That is unbelievable . Oh , Jake . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Yeah . ( Link ) Yeah , come on . Let 's get out of here . No . Wait a minute . Wait , wait. I think I 've got the perfect way to get us onto the base . Maybe we ought to give ' em a buzz . Think we ought to give ' em a buzz ? Yeah , give ' em a buzz . Dydee One calling Big Cheese . Dydee One calling Big Cheese . Come in . Big Cheese . Come in . Dydee One calling Big Cheese . - What 's the military doing here ? - This could be complicated , sir . What isn 't ? - Get that door closed ! - Uh-oh . What does it all mean ? it means it 's exceptionally complicated . Dydee One calling Big Cheese . Come in , Big Cheese . Come in . Dydee One calling Big Cheese . Ah , here comes General Cheese . I mean , Stilton . - ( Frank ) Wait . Hold Jake for a minute . - Yes . - How do I look ? - Could you hold Lucy for a minute ? - Do I look like a general ? - Oh , well ... Frank , you look very commanding . - That 'll have to do . Let 's go . - OK . He got the cat . That 's the cat ! Where 's the general going with those two ? That 's the general ? It 's not ? Open your door ! Open the doors ! Open the doors ! Halt ! Halt in the name of the US ... Fantastic . - Listen , good luck , huh ? - Yeah . Be careful . - Bye , Lucybelle . Thanks for everything . - Yeah , yeah . Let 's go . Bye . - They 've escaped ? - Yes . But , fortunately for us , they left something very valuable behind . ( car door opens ) - General Stilton ? - Of course ! Of course . I 'll sign you in , sir . General Stilton and cat . Is the cat cleared , sir ? - What do you think ? - Sorry , sir . I want the hangar open . All personnel out . We 're moving the ship . But sir , if we order ' em out of the hangar , how are you gonna ... - Soldier ! - Out of the hangar , sir . Yes , sir . Get the hangar doors open . All personnel out of the hangar on the double . - First , let 's get the ship out of the hangar . - Check . .. to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you 're being ... ( sniggering ) - Colonel ? - Yes , sir . Hold it right here , Frank . 130 to countdown . Hurry . Insert the gold in the microtransformer . Right , right . - Got it . - Good . Now let 's see if we have contact . Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship . Come in , Mother . - Where 's the microphone ? - Frank ! OK , OK . Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship . Come in , Mother . Hi there. fella . See you made it with nothing to spare . - We had problems . - We are 105 to liftoff . Coming in on ray 0392 . Adjust transmuter . - Adjustment made . - Countdown starts at 20 . Set clinometers . - Clinometers set . Give me a printout . - Coming your way without delay . - That 's another cat ? - Oh , yeah . A real mother . - l gotta get to that spaceship right away . - Who are you ? A friend of Frank Wil ... I mean General Stilton . A very good friend . Let 's go . Open the gate . My car ! - Them , too . - Never mind . Let 's get down to Hopscotch . - Sergeant . - Captain . Colonel . - General . - Oh , get in ! - ( Mother Ship ) Counting down . - Hey , Frank ! Hold it , sir , right there . General , this man says ... Hey ! You 're not General Stilton . - Frank . - What are you doing here ? Frank , it 's a nightmare . Liz has been captured by Stallwood . Have you been hitting the beer ? Stallwood of Supplies ? He 's an agent for some guy named Olympus , a power-crazed creep who 's ... - He 's holding her for ransom . - Lucybelle , too ? Yeah , he wants that collar , Jake . It 's the collar or Liz . - Where is she ? - I 'm going with you , Frank . No , no , you don 't want to get stuck here on Earth . You 're responsible to your mission . - But I 'm the reason for the mess they 're in . - Do you know where they 're taking her ? - Place called Dailey 's Airport . - Do you know where it is ? Let 's go . - Frank ... - Jake , you 're going home . Now , get in there . So long , buddy . Yeah . Let 's go . 5 . 4 3 . 2 . ignite . Bye , Jake . Drop us a card . OK , you clowns . Let 's move it . Let 's go . Jake ! Jake , this is insane . You 're here forever , on Earth . You 're wasting time . The airport ! General , look ! ( General ) Good heavens ! That 's my car . Get the police on the radio . - Hello , Sequoia ? - Turn around ! Here comes a car . It 's Wilson . Yeah , and Link . And the cat ! They 're here . They 've come . Naturally . You knew they would . You knew it . We 've won . Now they will have turn over the cat and we will turn over the girl . We will ? We won 't ? it may be difficult to explain your part in this after the young lady 's gone to the police . Oh , dear . You wouldn 't dare ? Frank , that must be the chopper . ( sirens wailing ) It 's the police , sir . It 's a trap . The fools ! Get us airborne . ( Jake ) Watch it ! - They 're getting away ! - Yeah . But look who 's arriving - the army and the police . We have to follow that copter . What kind of an airport is this ? Where are the planes ? Follow me . Oh , you can 't fly this , Jake . It 's a wreck . Look at that propeller - it 's half gone . - Are you coming or staying ? - I 'm coming . I 'm staying . OK , tovarisch . Ponimayete po-russki ? - Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? - Parlez-vous Francis ? - What ? - All right , Dr. Garbage Expert . Who 's your accomplice ? Who 's flying that plane ? Uh ... General , you 're not gonna believe this . There they are . - It 's Wilson and the cat . - How did they get that wreck in the air ? The power that cat possesses is awesome . You betcha , Charlie , and if you know what 's good for you , you 'll land ... - Quiet ! - OK . Faster , Omar , faster . Get close . Use the collar to force them to land . No chance . It 's taking all I got just to keep this crate flying . Don 't panic . We 'll think of something . What 's happening ? Why aren 't they doing something ? Of course ! They 're afraid of harming the girl . Turn on them , Omar . The advantage is ours . What 's happening ? Why are they turning around ? Straight at them , Omar . Drive them down . Frank ! Jake ! ( Frank screams ) Jake . Jake . Jake ! Jake . Jake . Turn this thing over . Jake . Jake . Jake . Jake ! Jake . Jake ! Frank , are you OK ? - What are they trying to do ? - Force us down . They probably figured out that we 've got a problem . Hold on . Here they come . - They 're still on our tail . - Don 't panic . On top of them , Omar . Smash them down ! Whoa ! ( Jake ) I see ' em . I see ' em . Look out . Jake ! Jake ! - Here they come again . Jake . - Yeah , yeah . Fruitcake . Frank , watch out ! Jake , Jake . ( Jake yowls ) Uh-oh . Oh , boy . Jake . Oh , dear . Jake .

( gunshot ) ( coughing ) - What happened ? - You happened , you imbecile ! - How bad is it , Omar ? - He got the controls . They 're locked . When the fuel runs out , we 're through . Shall we bail out ? We have no choice . Bail out ? Where are you going ? I haven 't got a parachute , either . - Then you have a problem . - l haven 't got a parachute either . Then you have the same problem . Wait ! No , wait ! Wait a minute ! I d ... I don 't want to die ! Oh , swell . Frank ! Frank ! ( groans ) Yes , Mr. President . Absolutely , Mr. President . We 're just waiting for them to land and we 'll pass that on . - Yes , sir . - What 'd he say ? Jake is to be treated as the representative of a friendly power , with generous borrowing credit . In exchange for bases , of course . Look , sir , chutes . They bailed out . Holy mackerel ! Who 's flying the chopper ? Frank ! Easy , Liz . Don 't panic . - What are you gonna do , Frank ? - l don 't know , but I have to do something .

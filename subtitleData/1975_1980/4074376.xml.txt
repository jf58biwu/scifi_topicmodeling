 'Moonbase Alpha , status report , 2,310 days after leaving Earth orbit , 'Dr Helena Russell recording . 'Two days ago we made contact 'with an Earth-type planet in our West Quadrant . 'First reports indicate it can support our life forms . 'Our survey team is carrying out an investigation 'to substantiate this report . 'Until the tests are complete , Commander Koenig has imposed 'a quarantine on all food , water and minerals . 'The planet appears to be uninhabited , 'although word has come through that the survey team 'has discovered a mysterious structure . ' You 've checked for life signs ? The molecular bonding is sophisticated . Sensor beams just bounced off . There 's got to be a way in . 'Tony . ' John , I was about to call in . You should see this place . It 's fantastic ! There 's a valley here that 's perfect for us . 'Hate to spoil the flow , but we 've discovered signs of civilisation , 'some kind of sealed living area . Tony , head back immediately . 'I 'd like everyone in close until we check it out . ' Yeah , sure . Here . Come on . Food , water ... Minerals . The planet 's a wonder ! It 's raw data . We usually wait until the computer has processed it . - But the computer 's so slow . - Only to a Psychon mind . - I wish we were with them . - Why should they have all the fun ? ( Beeping ) ( Electrical whining ) Tony ! ( High-pitched whine ) ( Screams ) Joe ? ( Joe chokes ) ( Whimpers ) Joe ? ( Fires laser ) Joe ! ( High-pitched whine ) ( Screams ) ( Koenig ) ' Tony ! 'Tony ! ' Laser wound . How about those bruises ? Fight ? ( Beeping ) I 'd say it adds up to a stupid accident . They fell out , a weapon was pulled . Maybe . But why did Tony take off like that ? He 'd just killed a man . Found it half a kilometre west of here . West ? Heading away from base camp . The state he 's in , he may not know where he 's headed . Take care of Lustig . Let 's go ! ( Whine ) Welcome . - They still haven 't found Tony . - They 'll find him , Maya . I feel so helpless . I keep thinking about him . Alone , perhaps hurt and suffering down there . John won 't give up until he finds him . Yes ... I know . ( Breathes heavily ) ( Groans ) It 's 100 per cent safe . Maybe , but orders are to touch nothing , at least until the quarantine period has elapsed . All right , kill it ! Any luck ? We 're not gonna force our way in , that 's for sure . How about Tony ? - What about him ? - Is it true he 's cracked up ? I don 't know . Ask a doctor . Let 's hope they find him . If he 's still alive . Let 's see if we can burn away some of this rock . He can 't be far ahead . Let 's go ! Spread out , go that way ! This way ! - There he is ! - I 'll take him . No ! Make sure he doesn 't double back . - He 's armed . - I know , but I don 't think he 'll use it on me . Go ahead . - Entry mechanism ? - Uh-huh , but no power . Hmm , solar cells . And there 's a lot more of them . ( Beep ) - Koenig . - ( Alan ) ' I think we found - ' a way into the alien structure . ' - Good . It 's powered by solar cells . If we 're right , once they 're charged , we should be in . Let Travers handle it . We 've found Tony . - Good news . - ' We don 't have him yet . ' You don 't know his condition ? No , but we will soon . Alan , you and Spencer pick us up . Tony ! Tony , it 's all right ! ( Groans ) Easy ! Tony , Tony ! Easy , easy ! Tony ! No , Tony ! Tony , no ! Tony ! ( Moans ) ( Beeping ) - He 's lapsing into deep coma . - Is there anything we can do ? I 've given him a shot to stop him sinking further , but without proper medical facilities , there could be brain damage . All right , let 's get him back to Alpha . ( Engines start ) Maya , we found Tony . Tell Helena we 're bringing him in . 'Yes , Commander . Commander ... ' - How is he ? - ' Sick . Very sick . ' It 's OK to drink . Quarantine period is over . How 's it going ? Another couple of hours should do it . ( Choking ) - ' Moonbase Alpha from survey team ! ' - Go ahead . 'Raise the commander . Tell him ... ' Gerry ... ! Gerry ! My men , they 're dead . Commander , Gerry Travers called in from the alien structure . The communications malfunctioned ... ( Koenig ) Stabiliser 's gone . Switching to back-up ! We 're holding . Yeah . Long enough to get to Alpha ? I wouldn 't bet on it . Maya , we 're having trouble with the Survey Eagle . - ' Malfunctions . ' - Can you correct ? We 'll try . If negative we 'll head back and switch to Eagle One . Moonbase Alpha to Survey Eagle . Moonbase Alpha to Survey Eagle ! - Moonbase Alpha to Survey Eagle . - What 's wrong ? The Survey Eagle 's malfunctioning . They 're checking the circuits . - Are they in danger ? - I don 't think so . Only ... Tony is if they don 't get him to Medical Centre . Let 's hope they do . We 've lost contact , not only with the Commander , but the base camp communications are affected , too ! ( Beeping ) Something 's happening to that planet , Helena . The atmosphere readings have changed drastically . Maintain present altitude . I 'll check these circuits before we head for Alpha . All the metal has corroded . Get back to base camp ! Quick . They 're heading back to the planet . What 's wrong ? He 's dead . Poisoned . It must have been the fruit . That makes three . Two of my men drank water from the rock pool . I don 't understand . The fruit and water checked out safe . And now they 're pure poison . Base camp coming up . ( Beeping ) They 're on touch-down approach . All systems holding . ( Engine roars ) John ! Temperature increase . Helena , the ship 's on fire ! John , she 's going down ! ( Koenig ) OK , I 've got this one , Alan ! John , I 'll take over ! Tony . Come on . Move it ! They didn 't make it , Helena . Their controls disintegrated before touchdown . Where are you going ? To check on Eagle One . We have to get them back to Alpha . OK , but you need checking , too . - So hurry back . - Yeah , sure . The medical kit . Maya , how close were they before their controls broke up ? Close . Close enough to have survived impact ? - I can 't be precise . - You can predict ! I can tell you what we both want to hear ! There 's a chance . Have the results of the computer scan come through yet ? I 'm analysing the data now . Alan ! Some landing ! Yeah . I have to admit it wasn 't one of my best . Tony ... - He 's alive . - We 've gotta get him back . Easy , Commander . No one 's going anywhere . We 're stranded . Stranded ? What about Eagle One ? You can forget Eagle One . It 'll fall apart if we try to use it . All the metals are corroded . Something else . Three of the survey team are dead . - Dead ? - Poisoned . They sampled food and water which were classified safe . It killed them . What about Tony ? A few bruises . Probably as a result of his scramble with Lustig . Nothing that could have affected him . Something flipped him . I examined Lustig . It was the laser beam that killed him , but I found evidence of brain cell expansion - the kind of pressure that can first drive a man mad , then kill him . - What caused the pressure ? - I don 't know . Is Tony suffering from this pressure ? I have a hunch that 's what I 'll find upon further examination . If you do , can you help him ? I don 't know . I wish we had him on Alpha . Yeah . Well , by now , Alpha knows we 're in trouble . Yeah . If they try to help us , their Eagles will be torn apart the minute they enter the atmosphere . What is it ? The planet . It 's an ecological disaster . The computer registers a massive build-up in poisonous elements . That 's not possible . We checked and double-checked before our people went down there . I know . It was safe . It started to change when they landed . Their arrival caused this change ? If the computer is correct , that 's exactly what I mean . Every circuit element has perished . The metals have just disintegrated . The plastics are holding up . Great ( ! ) We can 't build a communicator out of plastic . Wait a minute . - Hey , metalline fibres ! - Yeah , they 're non-corroded . Plastic , but one of the best conductors of energy we have . Yeah , they 'll conduct energy , but what energy ? We don 't have any a source of power . Yes , we do . There 's a cluster of solar cells around that alien structure . One set of solar cells , origin unknown . One induction unit , performance doubtful . And likewise , one transmitter . All right . Let 's reconsider . Maybe it IS the result of natural causes . No . Indications lead to a different conclusion . - Intelligent life ? - Intelligent , hostile and powerful enough to mobilise the natural forces of the planet to destroy us . Where is it ? Why doesn 't it register on our instruments ? I don 't know . Unless it 's so unfamiliar , its presence can 't register ! Maybe it 's hidden by that structure . That 's possible . 'Koenig to Alpha . John Koenig to Moonbase Alpha . ' - John ! We 're receiving you . - How 's Tony ? 'We can transmit , but cannot receive . 'Our situation is serious . We are without ships and equipment . ' Three of our party have died 'and the condition of Officer Verdeschi remains grave . 'We now know this planet is hostile to our life forms . ' We will strive to effect counter-measures . Until we do , I forbid any attempt at rescue . 'Repeat , no Eagles are to come down here . ' No Eagles are to come down here . Should they try , their metals will disintegrate on contact with the atmosphere . It was this phenomenon that caused the crash of ... Let 's hope some of it got through . The atmosphere will soon become impossible to breathe . They won 't have time for any effective counter-measures . I have to go down there , Maya . The problem is how . We can 't use the Eagles . The glider . The re-entry glider . - Re-entry glider ? - Yes , it 's made of carbon fibre . We can replace the metal seals on our spacesuits . Right . It has no power unit . It would be a one-way trip , Maya . - I know . For two passengers . - For two passengers . ( High-pitched whine ) - He 's cold . - Yes , Commander . What are his chances ? He might not get through the night . - Commander ! We 're in . - Good . Alert Carter . ( High-pitched whine ) ( Scream ) Have you worked out our launch position ? I 've tried to assess all the relevant factors . It 's a big planet , Maya . A small error could put us hundreds of miles from base camp . Then we 'll discover the joys of walking , won 't we ? There 's more of those here . It 's a holographic recording . The end has come . Only I , Zoran , the leader of this expedition , survive . But soon , I , too will be dead . To you who come , as we did , to search for this promised land , cease your struggle . There is only one way out of this pitiless world . Death . Dr Russell , atmosphere perimeter coming up . Activate airlock . Approaching extremity of atmosphere . - Stand by to launch . - ' Standing by ! ' 129,000 feet . ( Helena ) 110,000 feet ... Launch ! There 's a fault . We haven 't got release ! I haven 't released you . I 'm taking you closer . The Eagle will break up . You 're risking your life . That makes three of us . Malfunction ! You 're on your own , girls . Good luck . - Stand by for re-entry . - Standing by . Survey reports indicate that this planet is ideal . Our people have rejoiced in the good fortune that has guided us to this hospitable land . But as yet , we have not located our mining party . A further complication is the inexplicable breakdown of our most vital equipment . ( Beeping ) He 's gone again . Let 's try another disc . Wait ! He was interrupted . He 's coming back . The natural resources of this planet have turned poisonous . Half our number have perished . Our own supplies are dwindling . We are facing disaster . 35,000 feet , stand by for turbulence . We 've got to get out of this turbulence ! - We 'll miss the base camp . - That 's right . Yesterday , the survivors of the mining party were found in deep coma and suffering with a mysterious form of brain damage . They regained consciousness shortly before death and were lucid enough to describe to us what had happened . We are being destroyed by an immortal creature of awesome power . A solitary being which yearns for contact with other forms of intelligent life . It did not seek to deliberately destroy our mining party . It wanted to communicate , to talk , to express the joy it felt at discovering a form of life other than itself . But the means it chose inflicted insanity and violent death . We must find a way to communicate with it . We must ... make it understand ! Commander , Tony 's come round . ( Sighs ) They regain consciousness just before death . Yeah . Alan , go through the records again . Maybe we missed something . Let 's go . Landing site ? Yes , get it down quickly or we 'll hit those trees . John . Hello , Tony . - How ... are we doing ? - We 're still a long way from home . - Lustig ! - Easy , easy . I didn 't kill Lustig . - We 'll talk about it later . - No . No , now . Listen to me . We got separated . I heard a shout , I went back . He was crazy . He tried to kill me . You tried to disarm him , the laser went off . - Yeah . - And then what ? I was about to call in and I ... I ... I heard ... something . A weird , weird noise . It seemed to be ... all around me . Go on . The noise , it was eating up my mind . I tried to run and get away ... And I turned and I saw it ! - Did it have a form , a shape ? - No . Just ... light . Intense ... patterns of energy . Forming , changing . For a second I ... I thought it would ... take on a definite form . It seemed to be ... trying to do that . But it didn 't . - That 's all ? - Yeah . Something ... hit me . My mind just ... burned up . It confirms what we know already , Tony . Hey , look ! Helena ! Maya ! - John ! - How did you get here ? - Glider . - Glider ? I 'll tell you later . - Tony ? - He 'll wanna see you . Come on . ( Beeping ) There 's no permanent brain damage , no other real damage . Massive shock . It 's almost as if the will to live has been destroyed . It 's following a pattern . First the madness , then the clear , lucid head , shortly followed by death . Maya . Do what you can for him . We 've found another disc . It might help . My attempt to communicate with the being has proved fatal . Yesterday , I finally confronted it . I was protected with a suit which was specially designed to block its destructive powers , but the suit was flawed . A simple error in the eye section . I looked at it and I was lost , insane . Now I follow in the path of the others . I am lucid . I record these details , knowing that I am soon to die . While you were away , we found this . There it is . ( Beeping ) It 's still active . So is this . It must be a communicator . If we increase the protection around the eyes ... - It 's Tony 's only chance . - And ours . ( Koenig ) That 's where Lustig was found - through that arch . If I 'm lucky , I 'll make contact with the being in that clearing . Don 't press your luck , John . Please be careful . And no matter what , don 't take off this helmet . Hey , better memorise the approach . ( Koenig ) Yeah . - Commander , do you read me ? - ' Loud and clear . ' How do you feel ? 'Like I 'm in a hole a million feet deep ! 'I wish I could see out of this thing . ' The only certain protection is to completely shield your eyes . You 've memorised the path ? 'Right , just point me . ' Good luck , John . Bear right . Straight . Duck ! ( High-pitched whine ) I am not your enemy . I am not your enemy ! I don 't want to harm you ! ( Being ) I 'm not your enemy . I don 't want to harm you ! - ( Koenig ) I have no weapon . - ( Being ) I have no weapon . Please , I 've got to talk to you . We 've got to communicate . We 've got to find a way to communicate . Please , I 've got to talk to you . Communicate . ( Being ) Communicate . ( Voice slows ) Communicate . Communicate . Yes , please . ( Being ) I have found the key . We are in communication . Who are you ? What are you ? I am I. Who are you ? What are you ? A man . - John Koenig . - You are a voice . ( Koenig ) I am a living being . Like you . There is none but I. And I am I. No ! You are one among many . ( Being ) You are more than a voice . - Yes . - Reveal that which is John Koenig . ( Koenig ) Why ? To know that you are more than a voice . ( Koenig ) What about the others who looked at you ? - Others ? - The others who looked at you and went insane . You don 't know the power you possess . You can look at me , John Koenig . Reveal that which is you . - No , John ! - He 's crazy - if he removes that mask . - Don 't remove your helmet ! I trust you . There is truly more than I. Yes . You are one among many , as I am . - May I show you ? - Yes ... Yes . Helena ! Maya ! Alan ! Show yourselves ! But John Koenig , if I am not I , then what ? That is for each of us to discover . How is that done , John Koenig ? I speak for myself , though I am one of many . If we understand others , in time I believe ... we come to understand ourselves . I sense death in your minds . What is death ? That which we humans fear most , the end of life . And I have caused death ? Yes , because you were unaware of life other than your own . You brought me understanding . And death was your reward . I cannot support this grief that I feel . - Will you help us ? - Yes . All will be well . I that am I is no more . I that will be ... has much to regret . There 's no one here . The camp 's deserted . Somebody 's taken all our gear . Bill , why are you here ? The corrosive elements in the atmosphere evaporated . I got the all-clear and came in . Everyone 's in the Eagle . Time 's limited . The moon 's moving out of range . Just when we find what could be a lovely home , we can 't stay . I know . Bill , lead the way . Tony . Maya ! Ready to go home ? ( Sighs ) I really didn 't think we were gonna make it this time . - We had a little help . - From a friend .

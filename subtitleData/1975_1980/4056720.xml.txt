 Shermeen , this time I think we 've finally got it . - Go get some glasses , will you ? - OK . - Shermeen ? - Yes , Eddie ? - Listen to me ! - I am ! Since you started cultivating hops for Tony 's poison beer , - I don 't even exist . - Tony 's beer is not poison ! Shermeen ... the moment of truth has arrived . - Well ? - It 's terrific ! Hey , Eddie , how about a sip of beer ? - No , thanks . - Happier than usual , huh ( ? ) Come on . See you , Eddie . Yeah , sure ( ! ) - Sensors have picked something up . - ( Koenig ) ' Anything specific ? ' - Can 't tell yet . - ' I 'm on my way . ' All right , everybody , get ready for the taste of a lifetime ! Verdeschi 's brew number 29 ! Made from a generation of Alpha hops , especially brewed by our hydroponic botanist , Shermeen Williams ! Shermeen , will you do the honours , please ? No , thanks . I 'd hate to ruin a beautiful friendship . No . As chief medical officer , I must retain my sanity . Er , thanks , no . I happen to be on a liquid-free diet . I see . OK . Very funny . It wasn 't like that in Hydroponics . - Did we misjudge the fermenting ? - We sure misjudged something ! There is another string of hops . We could try again . No , thanks . Hydroponics is out ! - I 'll try something different . - So you think it 's my fault ? ! - Well , I wasn 't accusing her ! - She 's a very sensitive girl . - What 's going on ? - Someone needs a little comfort . Shermeen has a teenage crush on you , Tony . You must handle her with care . Just because she cultivated a few hops for my beer ? ! Oh , come on ! ( Distant humming ) ( Gasps ) No ... No ... No ! 'Moonbase Alpha - status report . '1,702 days after leaving Earth orbit . Dr Helena Russell recording . 'After countless number of days of serenity , 'a simple case of teenage infatuation has broken out on Alpha . 'I 'm on my way to treat it now , 'and expect that it can be cured without any serious complications . ' Shermeen ? Are you all right ? Yeah , I ... must have fallen asleep . I had a dream . There was this face staring at me in the darkness . A nightmare , probably . You were very upset when you left Command Center . The eyes - they were wanting me to stare back , they were coming closer . I could give you a tranquilliser . It 'll make you feel better . Oh ... no . Doctor , I 'm really all right . After all , it was only a dream . I 'd like to go back to Hydroponics now , er ... I 've a few plantings to look after . OK . Come along with me to Medical Center first . ( Koenig ) Magnify . Maya , give me a reading . Constellation - Pintarus . Star ... 19 , Pintarus . Planet - uncharted satellite . Atmosphere - compatible . Temperature at constant 78 degrees . Suitable for human inhabitation . Abundant vegetation . No sign of animal life . Bill , locate a landing site . - We 'll see how good it is . - Right . - ' Medical Center . ' - Helena , join the landing party . 'I have some lab tests I 'm monitoring , John . - ' I 'll have to see them through . ' - I understand . 'John , I just left Shermeen . She was very upset . 'She said she saw a disembodied face staring at her . Was it a nightmare ? 'I gave her some tranquillisers and let her go back on duty . - Good . She 's in the landing party . - ' She 's in no condition for that . ' All right , Helena . Thank you . Bill , tell Eddie Collins I want him in the landing party . Now , what 's bothering you , young Tony ? Shermeen 's been on the first team a long time . She 'll be very hurt . Well , she looks up to you , Tony . You explain it to her , OK ? ( Man ) Shermeen ... Shermeen ... Shermeen ... Shermeen ... Shermeen ? Shermeen ? W-what do you want ? - I 've come to apologise . - What for ? For being an unfeeling , insensitive boor . Oh ... Oh , you 're not that , Tony . I know you 've put in a lot of time and effort to help me , and ... Well , I wish I had an excuse for acting the way I did . It 's all right , I understand . It 's OK . Shall we try again ? Oh , sure , we should . Yeah . As a matter of fact , I think we 'll come up with the right combination next time . I was thinking ... maybe if we cross-pollinated the barley hybrids ... Oh , Sure . Great idea . Look , there 's something else , Shermeen . The Commander 's sending a landing party to that planet . - I can be ready ! - Hang on . You 've been upset and ... Eddie Collins is the botanist we 're taking . But I 've been collecting specimens from every place we 've been to ! - I tried to tell them that . - You tried to tell them ? It was probably your idea I don 't go ! Oh , you 're a hypocrite ! - Shermeen ... - You didn 't come to apologise ! I hate you ! I don 't ever want to see you again ! - Shermeen ... - Don 't touch me ! ( Sniffs ) - I 'm sorry . - I bet you are . ( Man ) Shermeen ... Don 't resist , Shermeen . Let me come through . I won 't harm you , Shermeen . Let me come through . No , I am not a figment of your imagination . Who are you ? Where are you from ? My name is Vindrus ... and I suppose you could say I come from Sunim . Sunim ? The planet that you are now approaching , which has the answer to your present unhappiness . You will see it soon . That 's not possible . Oh , I assure you it is . You have my word . I 'm not going down to Sunim . Eddie 's going . So I heard . But trust me , Shermeen . Just do as I ask and you will go with the landing party ... and Tony will never upset you again . Is that the magnus lilarium ? Yes . Break open the pod and select a healthy seed . Now , put it on the propagatoscope . - ( Humming ) - Now bombard it with protons . ( Humming rises ) Increase the bombardment . Continue . ( Intense buzzing ) Switch off . Plant it . But be careful . ( Footsteps ) Now prepare to embark . I don 't understand . Why ... ? There isn 't time to explain . Go ! Quickly ! Hurry , Shermeen ! Hey , Shermeen ... don 't be mad ! - Is all the gear on Eagle 1 ? - Yep , all on board . Where 's Eddie Collins ? I don 't know . He should have been here . Shermeen ? I thought you were supposed to be in Hydroponics . - You need a botanist . - Yes , but Eddie ... Eddie Collins has been taken sick . He 's in the Medical Center . Dr Russell said I was fit for duty . Sure you 're OK ? No nightmares ? - No nightmares . - Good . Well , good luck . Maya , everything all right back there ? Everything under control . 'Shermeen ? ' 'Shermeen ? ' I 'm prepared . Maya , is there any variation on previous readings ? No hostile environment . Temperature still constant at 78 degrees . No life forms . Everything down here is exactly like Earth . There should be life forms . Keep checking . - Bill ? - Commander ? - You all right ? - Yeah . Just disembarkation readjustment . Commander ? You shuddered . But not from cold . I felt as if a ghost had ... I had a superstitious grandmother . Well , if you want to knock on wood , there 's plenty of that about . Maya ... that structure ... Obviously built by intelligent life . My sensors still record no life forms . ( Man ) Shermeen ... Shermeen . This way . ( Screeching ) ( Screeching ) Bill ! Maya ! ( Koenig ) Stop , he won 't come past the obelisk . Shermeen . Better find her . Koenig to Alpha ! Koenig to Alpha ! Koenig to Moonbase Alpha ! Koenig to Alpha ! Come in , Alpha ! ( Maya and Fraser in distance ) Shermeen ! Shermeen ! Shermeen ! ( Maya ) Where are you ? ( Fraser ) We 're over here ! - ( Screeching ) - ( Gasps ) Oh ! Don 't be afraid , Shermeen . He 's one of us . He won 't attack you . You 're quite safe . Go on , Shermeen . That 's right . Go on , Shermeen , move past him . Why didn 't that ... ? - Thaed . - Thaed ... Why didn 't it attack me ? - I promised you wouldn 't be harmed . - I wasn 't even frightened . You 'll not fear on Sunim . My only concern is for your wellbeing . But first I must cross from my world into yours . I don 't understand , I thought you were already here . Only in spirit ... not in substance . This machine will enable my solid body to come over into your world ... - if you will assist me . - How ? An unfortunate accident . Sometime in the past , the generator exploded . So before I can help you , you must help me ... if you will detach this cylinder and take it to Alpha . But you were on Alpha . Why don 't you take it there yourself ? I cannot . As I have explained to you , I 'm only here in spirit ... not in substance . - What will I do with it ? - That will be explained to you . For the time being put it in your specimen bag . I can 't find her . Shermeen gone , I can 't raise Alpha ... Our sensors recorded no animal life , yet we saw that creature ! There could be a shield force coming from that structure , cutting out communications and sensors . ( Fraser ) Commander ! She 's been here . I just found this . Her footprints lead towards the structure . ( Screeching ) - How did she get past that creature ? - I don 't know . Even though the tracks lead in that direction , could be she never made it inside . There 's one way to find out . Maya ? ( Screeching ) - Shermeen ? - Yes ? ( Gasps ) ( Sighs ) Shermeen ! Are you all right ? Of course . Why shouldn 't I be ? - How did you get in here ? - I walked in . The creature must have been concentrating on us and missed you . Come on . The Commander 's worried . Oh ... wait a minute . I want to get this down on video . Koenig to Alpha ! Koenig to Alpha ! Come in , Alpha . ( High-pitched beeping ) ( High-pitched beeping ) Shermeen ! - Shermeen ! Wait ! - Bill , hold it . It 's all right , Maya . He won 't attack us . Come on . Just wait . Come on ... Yes , it 's OK . It really won 't attack us . Come on . Look , I 'll show you . See ? ( Shermeen ) There you are , you see . I told you . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , fine . Bill ... You saw ? Yeah . Shermeen seems to have some kind of immunity . Let 's go . ( Growling ) ( Whispering voices ) When ... ? When ... ? When ... ? When ... ? ( Vindrus ) Patience ! ( Voices ) When ... ? When ... ? When ... ? ( Vindrus ) Patience ! It will be soon . - Bill , take over . - Right . Shermeen ... - Mind if we have a little chat ? - No . I 'm curious . How did you get into that temple ? Just walked in , Commander . I know , but when I tried to do that , the ... the creature attacked me . What I 'm trying to find out is why didn 't the creature attack you ? I don 't know . Maybe it knew that I wouldn 't attack him . Why did you go in there ? It was just very ... peaceful . You could have been hurt . No harm will come to me on Sunim , Commander . On where ? Er ... on the planet . Is that what it 's called - Sunim ? - Yes . - How do you know that ? Er ... I don 't know . Someone must have told me . Someone ? Who ? I don 't remember . Look , why are you asking me ? ! I haven 't done anything ! Of course not . I 'm not even suggesting you have . Shermeen , I 'm glad you came with us . I 'd be curious to learn about those . You will give me a report , won 't you ? Yes ... Yes , I will . Good . ( Maya ) I found these on the walls . They depict the whole evolutionary process of man . Emerging from a sea of primeval slime , then advancing through all stages of development : Simian ... Australopithecus , Neanderthal , Cro-Magnon , to modern . - Well , they sure look human enough . - I 'm not sure , Commander . - What do you mean ? - There 's something strange . Somewhere up the ladder of development , something happened . There was violent death . Whoever they were , they must have died in some searing burst of energy . That 's why our sensors recorded no life forms . Yet you saw a life form . Yeah . So what 's the explanation ? Well , based on what I 've observed and computer hypothesis , I think we 're dealing with a form of antimatter against matter . This accelerator was set up in the temple . I 've seen a similar one once on my own planet . What 's its function ? ( Maya ) It converts antimatter into matter . That 's a theory I never did understand . Well , this is made up of particles of matter ... this is made of particles of matter , and even this is made of matter . I don 't have to be a genius to understand that . For every particle of matter , there 's a particle of antimatter . It 's the Law of Symmetry . It 's Nature 's way of maintaining a balance . We live in a world of matter , so in theory , there must be an antimatter world . - Existing where ? - Here . Now . - Occupying our space ? - No ... Occupying their own ... anti-space . If there was an antimatter being here now ... - Yeah ? - .. my hand would go through him . I see . Tony , something happened to Shermeen on that planet . I want to know what it was . Well , why don 't you ask her ? I did , but she was holding back . Oh , I see . You want me to ask her , right ? Right . I think you can reach her . Not any more , I don 't think . Try , Tony . Cos if we don 't find out ... ( Sighs ) OK . I 'll try . Shermeen , you must take that cylinder to the equipment room . You must find a nuclear generator into which that cylinder fits . ( Footsteps ) Shermeen , I 'd like to talk to you . What about ? About the way you 've been behaving . You used to be so happy , full of life , and now you walk around as ... as if you 're sleepwalking . - Where did you get that ? - ( Vindrus ) Sunim . My name is Vindrus . Shermeen has very kindly volunteered to assist me . Assist you ? To do what ? To cross over into your world . I see our world is more attractive . Not really . But you and your world have started your evolutionary process from the slime of the ocean , and are ascending towards perfection in the future . We , in the antimatter world , however , started our evolutionary process at the top , and are descending towards the slime . So ... our future ... is extinction . Don 't try to give the alarm , you would never reach it . We have no objection to you crossing into our world , if it 'll keep you from ending up in the slime . Let us help you cross over . Thank you for your offer , but you would not do it willingly . - Why not ? - Nature has to be kept in balance . For every one who crosses into your world , one of you must cross into ours . You will forget everything that took place here . You know what you have to do , Shermeen . Hello , Chris . Hello , Shermeen . What can I do for you ? I brought you a plant . You said you wanted something to brighten up the equipment room . If there 's one thing I can do without , it 's plants . Not this one . - This one 's very special . - Uh-huh ? You 'll like it . It has a really beautiful fragrance . - Bill ... - Shermeen ! - I have a surprise for you . - Oh ? It has a lovely fragrance . You must take us to Sunim . Oh ... Wow , do I feel lousy . So does Chris Potter . We found him in the equipment room in the same state you 're in . - What ? - Yeah . Not only that , one of our miniature nuclear generators is missing . ( Beeping ) - ' Commander ? ' - Yes , Maya ? - ' Eagle 1 has just taken off . ' - What ? ! Who 's aboard ? Fraser was piloting . Shermeen was with him . Well , that figures . I want Eagle 2 ready for lift-off ! Come on . Now , just turn the green dial a fraction more to the right . - ( Rising hum ) - Excellent ! Now all that remains is for me to come into your world , Shermeen . Is everything set now ? Everything 's set . Shermeen ! Shermeen ! Shermeen ! Bill ! Bill ! He 's in a trance - hypnotic . The temple . ( Rising hum ) You will not be harmed , Shermeen . Take her down . No ! No , I want to stay ! I want to stay ! ( Screams ) ( Screeching ) No , Tony ! Don 't try the laser . It 'll bounce back to us . It won 't come past that point . Hold its attention . He won 't go past the obelisk . Hey ! ( Snarls and screeches ) How did you know ? Our sensors showed no life form on Sunim . So it had to be antimatter . ( Whispering voices ) Vindrus ! Vindrus ! We have three more ... ready for the transfer . Welcome . Welcome to Sunim . My name is Vindrus . What ? Well , I know it 's crazy , but I feel I 've seen him before . How is it our lasers bounce off antimatter ? We have evolved certain techniques in our many attempts to cross over . We can reflect electrical beams ... And project into our minds the illusion that an antimatter form may appear solid ? Yes . Are you antimatter ? There 's only one way to find out . Obviously , I am no longer antimatter . You 've taken over one of our technicians . She 's here . I want her back . - She 's inside . - Send her out . I wanted her to come out with me , but she refuses . Perhaps you should come in and get her yourself . John , don 't go in there . Don 't ask me how I know , but ... there 's terrible danger in there . Maya , stay with Tony . I 'm going in with him . You stay out here as a backup , Maya . Where is she , Vindrus ? ! Commander ! Tony ! Now I remember ! Yes . Now you are permitted to remember . You sent her to your world so you could come into ours . We have to maintain the balance . We would prefer it to be different but unfortunately it is the only way . - Where is she ? - You 'll see her soon . My coming here is an act of self-survival . If it was the other way round you 'd do the same . What about Shermeen 's survival ? She can expect an anti-life of hundreds of years . And so can you , Commander . And Mr Verdeschi ... and Maya . How many others , Vindrus ? How many others ? Certainly not just us . Not even just Alpha ! Eventually , we 'll have machines like this throughout the universe . No , Tony ! Commander Koenig is already aware that your lasers are , shall we say , counterproductive . However ... we have weapons that are quite effective . Vindrus ... we 're no good to you dead . You need us alive so you can make the exchange . Accept the exchange ... Both of you . As individuals you will have an extended anti-lifespan . And our species ? Please ... into the cabinets , gentlemen . Vindrus ! Vindrus ! Shermeen 's coming back . - She 's coming back . - Impossible ! No , Vindrus , it 's not . ( Koenig ) She never got fully into your world , Vindrus . She only got halfway . I knew what you were after , so I programmed the generator so it couldn 't function on full power . ( Tony ) It 's no use . She 'll be back . She didn 't go all the way . There wasn 't enough power . Vindrus ! Vindrus , come here ! I 'm over here , Vindrus . Come to me . Do not be afraid , Vindrus . You 'll have to try again . They 're waiting for me . I cannot reach them . We will be destroyed ! ( Whispering voices ) Stop ... No ... ( Shermeen ) Don 't be afraid ! ( Shermeen ) You 'll have to try again , Vindrus . They 're waiting for me . ( Voices ) Stop ! Stop ! Vindrus , stop ! ( Koenig ) Now , Tony ! Get him in ! ( Shermeen , faintly ) Commander ! Commander ! Help me ! - Help me ! - Come on , Maya , hurry ! I 'm trying to remember the one on Psychon ! ( Rising hum ) If I make a mistake , matter and antimatter will collide . Right , and this corner of the universe will be blotted out . ( Shermeen ) Help me ! Commander ! Commander , help me ! I can 't remember ! Left ! Left ! No , no , no , no ! The green one ! The green one ! ( Shermeen ) Let me out ! ( Gasping ) It 's all right . It 's all right . I 'm setting this to self-destruct . Better get the door open . ( Tony ) There 's gotta be a switch here somewhere . Wait ! He was standing there when he closed it . I 'll take Eagle 1 ! Maya , go with him ! Shermeen , come with me . This way ! Get him in the back . Vindrus 's people will be destroyed ! Only matter will be destroyed , not antimatter . Hey , look ! The whole planet 's disappeared right from under us . It 's gone back to being antimatter . ( Beeping ) 'Eagle 2 . Commander , this is Moonbase Alpha . Can you read me ? ' Loud and clear , Alpha ! Loud and clear ! We 're on our way back to Alpha now . Out ! The problem is mechanical . It 's not creative , no way . Proper flow at the proper time to the proper place . That 's the trick . Oh , Shermeen , some new hops ! Thanks . Be with you , soon as I fix this . They 're not new ones , they 're the old ones . Yeah ? Oh . Can you store them till I 'm ready ? Sorry , I don 't have the room in Hydroponics any more . I 'm clearing out that area . No more hops . Huh ? No more hops ? Eddie Collins has an interesting theory on plant growth , and Eddie and I need that area for own cultivating . How about that ? ! Two days ago Shermeen was pining away due to unrequited love . Now she looks through me like I was ... - Antimatter . - Yeah . Hey ! Antimatter ! Yeah ! If I blend antimatter hops with hydroponic barley ... or antimatter barley with hydroponic hops ... Where would I get the antimatter grain from ? And then if I did come up with a great beer ... would I be able to see it ? Or taste it ?

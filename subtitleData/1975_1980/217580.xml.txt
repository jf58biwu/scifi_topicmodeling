 Bravo ! Bravo ! Children are born good-natured and innocent . If teachings are neglected , then their nature changes . Sung , what do you think you 're doing ? This is called " " hanging by the braid and jabbing on the butt " " . A royal jabber bestowed by Uncle Yang . If you don 't concentrate on your studies , your butt will be jabbed . I 'll tell my father if you jab me again . I 'll tell him that you sneaked out to steal bird eggs and almost fell into a shit hole . Then you 'll really get it ! Cousin , please don 't tell Uncle Yang ! All right , I 'll let you jab me one back ! All right , tell me what 's happening out there ? There is a lion dance in the sitting room . There are also many guests . Who are the guests ? They are masters from Shaolin , Wu Tang , White Crane , Wing Chun and other schools of martial arts . What a party ! Those people must have come to challenge my father . I don 't think so . I heard Uncle Yang invited them here to watch him wash his hands . He needs an audience to wash his hands ? What happens when he eats and pisses ? Let 's go and check it out ! Good idea ! Mother , you 're blocking my view . You 're pretty daring , aren 't you ? You should be inside studying instead of out here . You 'll be in big trouble if your father finds out . Mother , I 've been cooped up studying night and day . Even my braid is bored stiff ! Everything your father does , he does it for you ! Even this ? He 's washing his hands for me ? Of course . Be careful and don 't let your father see you . You got that ? Bravo ! My dear friends . Today , I have invited you all here to announce my retirement . After washing my hands in this golden basin , I will retire from the world of martial arts . Brother Yang , you 're famous for your Tai Chi lnvincible Fists . We all know you as honorable and righteous . Why are you retiring from the world of martial arts so suddenly ? Since the allied troops from eight foreign countries invaded China , we have suffered from civil conflicts and foreign threats . Now my only wish is to live in seclusion and bring up my son . So Dad wants to teach me his Tai Chi lnvincible Fists ! You wish ! I have known you all for decades . While some of you may regard me as your friend , others may feel vengeful against me . After I wash my hands in this golden basin , I hope to turn over a new leaf and put everything behind us . Who are you ? Mister , please pardon my ignorance . May I ask your name ? Last name is Wong . But all you need to know are these two legs . I have been undefeated all through the North . Today I 've come to challenge your Tai Chi Fists ! I have already decided to retire from the world of martial arts . If you insist on a challenge , then I will concede to a loss . Father ! Don 't be a coward ! Fight him ! I have long heard that Yang 's Tai Chi Fist is smooth to the bone . From the looks of it now , not only are your fists boneless , but you 're gutless ! So you don 't want to fight me ? I 'll kick you until you do ! From the kung fu novels I 've read , kung fu masters often fight with their words and not their fists . That is the highest level of martial arts . Why don 't we give it a try . What do you say ? Fighting with words ? How ? It 's simple . You just tell us your stance , describe your attack and how you will counter your enemy 's moves . This will determine the winner . Fighting by speech . Are you up to it ? You are my guest . You go first . Fine . Black Tiger Steals The Heart . I 'll counter with Stomping Fists . I 'll rotate my right fist and go for your wrist ! I 'll then draw my right fist and attack with Shaolin Palm . I 'll counter with Stomping Fist . I retrieve my palms and counter with continuous punches ! I 'm still using Stomping Fists . Stomping Fists again ? Do you have anything else ? Uncle Yang is only using Stomping Fists . Can he win ? What do you know ? Just watch and you 'll learn something . All right. I 'll give you a chance to see my leg work . Sun and Moon Roundabout Sweep . Front sweep , back sweep , right sweep , left sweep . Father , use King Kong Backward Punch . Backward throw ! Counter attack ! Fine. I 'll keep kicking ... kick ... kick ... Stop ! Why ? - You have already lost . - What are you talking about ? What does a woman know ? I 've been his wife all these years . Of course I know which one of his moves is a winner . Madam Yang is an expert indeed ! Mister , it was his backward throw kicking right and left . He tripped you off your feet before you even lifted your legs . - Get lost ! - May God bless you . I don 't have time to argue with you . Let 's fight a real fight with our fists ! Wild Wind Stance . White Monkey Stance . Good leg work ! You are indeed the Great Kick of the North . I 've lost . Stop stalling ! Today , either you break your arms or I break my legs . We must decide on a winner ! We are both masters of martial arts . Why do you insist so ? Not only do I insist , I 'll kick you until you cry for mercy ! Father , be careful ! Wild Horse Stance . Unrelenting lron Sweep . Criss Cross Hands . Good ! I am sorry . I 've overdone it . Yang , I have lost . But you haven 't seen the last of me yet ! Pre-destiny and life ... Practice of character ... Must be followed strictly or it goes against the rule . Dragon and the Hidden Tiger Fist . There is a waterfall on the shore .. Hey , are you thinking about girls again ? A gentleman loves a lady . Hawk-man , what are you reciting ? Recite " " Higher Learnings " " for me . Yes , Father . The road to higher learnings is practicing good deeds . Be close to your fellow men and treat each with kindness . Know when to stop ... Why have you come here instead of seeing your patients ? A father must teach his son ... Enough already ! You 've retired and moved to Hangzhou . Now instead , you lock up your son and nephew in the study and treat them like prisoners . It hurts me to see them like this . There is always a beginning and an end to everything . Hurry up and read ! Otherwise , I 'll jab your butt ! Mother ! The road to higher learnings ... Stop that ! Your mother can 't save you . It hurts me too ! But I still have to be tough . Once I let loose of this monkey , it will be hard to chase him back ! You worry so much . You should never have asked me for a son ! Enough now . Many patients are waiting for you . Go see them . Take this . A kind mother spoils her son . Do you understand ? Yes. I know . It 's mother . We 're free ! Be careful ! Come down ! The road to higher learnings is ... You can stop pretending now . Are you hungry ? Loosen your braid . Have some dim sum . - Mother , you are the greatest ! - Why ? You saved us . Kung fu books ? Why are you reading this ? Mother , these books are very important to me . They 're just different from Father 's . If your father sees them , he 'll surely burn them ! Put them away . Mother , I have a question . Yes ? Do you think father is loosing his mind ? How can you say that about your father ? You disrespectful son ! You don 't think so ? He ties my braid to the ceiling and jabs my butt . I ache from top to bottom and ... And , cousin Hawk-man .. he 's been thinking about girls ! Thinking about girls ? You 're really taking the lion out ? Don 't you want to go see the outside world ? If Uncle Yang finds out , we 'll be in big trouble . If father finds out , I 'll take the rap . Worse comes to worst , my butt will take the beating . Then ... Let me tell you. ln this world , there are three kinds of people . Which three kinds ? One kind only talks but does nothing . That 's the worst kind . The second kind talks while doing . What 's the last kind ? They 're like us . - How ? - The best kind . We do before we talk . Good ! Officer Lam , what do you think ? Not bad . Officer Tsao , what do you think ? Quite good . It 's getting better each year . Yes , Officer Tsao . Look , that guy looks so silly ! Wow , it 's an angel ! Hey , what 's the matter ? Let 's go ! I just saw a beautiful girl ! She 's just perfect ! She 's definitely one of a kind ! Yeung-wan ? Yeung-wan . It 's you . Look , isn 't this lion cute ? When did you get back ? You should have asked me to pick you up . I came back with some classmates . It 's so crowded here . Let 's go sit on the platform . Your father is here too . All right . Bye . Bye . What are you still looking at ? She 's gone ? Daddy . You 've come ! Take a seat . This is great ! The time has come to present our offerings to the Dragon Emperor . What are they doing ? It is the custom of this village to make offerings to the Dragon Emperor so he will bring us peace and a good harvest . Present the offerings now . Lower the virgin boy and girl into the river for the Dragon Emperor . Let me go ! Stop right there ! This is murder ! How can you drown these children in the river ? Miss , you 're ruining the ceremony ! That 's a big sin ! Send the offerings . Stop ! Yeung-wan ! Take your hands off ! They 've ruined the ceremony . Don 't let them go ! Get them ! Don 't touch her ! Get the guy who wrecked the ceremony . Beat him up ! Aren 't you going to help ? An angry crowd is impossible to control . Daddy , can 't you stop them ? It 's the will of the heavens . I 've really spoiled you . - These people are so ignorant . - They are despicable and pitiful ! Only we who have studied abroad can educate and save them ! Right . What do we do ? Let 's fight them with the kung fu we learned secretly . Stop ! Stop fighting ! It 's raining ! The Dragon Emperor is pissing ! He 's showing his powers now ! Heaven , if you had to piss , why didn 't you piss sooner ? Hey , can you walk ? Yes ! Then let 's go . Where are we going ? - Don 't you want to go home ? - Home ! Yes , home ! I 'll walk you home . You ... You 'll walk me home ? May I ? Sure ! Sure ! Of course ! You were so brave . You saved the two children . Confucius said , " " One must save others by all means . " " What ? I meant I was just doing what I was supposed to do . Hawk-man , be careful . Don 't get the lion wet ! Your name is Hawk-man ? - How about you ? - Rose . " " Lo-she " " ? is this lion very important to you ? It is a family treasure . Come . Put it under the umbrella too . Son of a gun ! Meets a girl on his first time out . This is Lung-Chan Village . You 're home . It 's still a little ways ahead . It is ? Then let 's walk . Hawk-man , we 're home . If you go any further , you 'll be on Courtship Road ! Yeah ... we 're here . The rain has stopped . I 'd better go . Thanks . No. I have to thank you instead . " " Lo-she , " " can we see each other again ? Sure . Bye . Where do you live ? How do I find you ? I live by West Lake . Bye . Uncle . Bye . Bye . Oh no , big trouble . Bye . Bye . So pretty ! Sung , isn 't she pretty ? You 'd better not tell ! Take a look at yourself ! What is wrong with you ? I 've told you again and again to study hard . Don 't go outside and get into trouble ! You just don 't listen ! Mother ! Even your mother can 't save you this time ! Look at the lion ! You have all but completely destroyed it ! is this a sea lion or a mud lion ? Oh , son . You 've ruined your father 's family treasure . Apologize to your father at once and then go back inside to study . I didn 't do anything wrong . It 's not my fault. lt 's ... lt 's not my fault either . Not your fault ? Then whose fault is it ? My fault ? Yes , it 's yours ! You 've locked me up like a prisoner for over 10 years . Don 't you think you 've gone too far ? I 've gone too far ? You tell me . Why did I retire and retreat from the world of martial arts ? Why did I leave my home and come here to live in seclusion ? For whom did I do all these things ? Fine. I 'd rather beat you to death myself ... than to let you be killed by strangers . I 'll beat you ... I haven 't done anything wrong ! Have you lost your mind ? Did you have to hit him on the face ? You want him disfigured ... so he will never be able to marry ? What are you trying to do ? Have you gone mad ? Your father only talks tough . He really does love you . I know. I just don 't want to be locked up in the study ... facing nothing but four walls and a stack of books all the time . I know nothing of the world outside . Who was that girl who walked you home earlier ? Her name is " " Lo-she . " " " " Lo-she " " ? You mean Rose ? Yes , it 's a western name . In Chinese , that is the name of a flower . Rose . What a nice name . She is Chinese . Why does she give herself a foreign name ? Those who study abroad usually have a foreign name . Your mother used to have one too . It 's Diana . " " Di-wan-na " " ? No. lt 's Di-an-a . It sounds good . Can you give me a foreign name too ? How about Jackie ? Jackie ? What does Jackie mean ? There 's no special meaning to it . When I was in the Bronx , I used to admire a hero . His name was Jackie . Rose also called me a hero . All right . Jackie it is . She called you a hero ? Then you have a chance ! Rose is both intelligent and pretty . Listen , if she is a rat , then you must be a cat that catches the rat ! - How ? - Remember . To woo such westernized girls , you must always remember to act like a hero . When you are with her , say " " yes " " often . Yes ? Yes ! Mother wants me to be a rat-catching cat . I 'm going to catch her . The West Lake area is so big ! You didn 't even ask her where she lives ? Where do we go to catch the rat ? West Lake is so beautiful , even the girls are nicer looking . Look . The rat is right there ! She threw me a love letter ! " " We demand democracy ! Let science save our country ! " " What does that mean ? I don 't know . " " Lo-she . " " Wait for me . Rose ... I 'm here . Hawk-man . I 've been looking for you . - How did you know I was here ? - My heart told me . Rose , I have an English name too . You can call me Jackie from now on . Jackie . Okay , I 'll call you Jackie . Yes ! - We 're even more in tune now . - Yes ! Why do you always say yes ? You say yes , so I say yes . Okay , then why don 't you help us pass out these flyers ? - Yes ! - Don 't keep saying " " yes . " " We have to get home . I still have a rat to catch . Go home and take care of my father for me . Jackie ! Yes ! Democracy saves our country ! Anyone wants democracy ? Anyone wants science ? It 's free ! It 's all free ! - What is this ? - This is a flyer . What 's a flyer ? We write what we want to say on paper for you to read . I can 't read . I 'll read it to you . We want to save our country with democracy .. Right , you want rice to make porridge . I want your feces to fertilize the fields . We 'll give feces , but you need scientific fertilization . Right . Give way . Let 's get out of here ! It 's the death penalty if we get caught ! Death penalty for saving the country ? Get out of here ! Come on . Rose , there are Ching soldiers . Run . Where is Jackie ? He didn 't run fast enough . He might have gotten caught . How could you leave him behind ? Give way . Give way ! Get him ! Freeze ! Be careful ! Watch out for my shit ... Oh ... It 's all gone ! Jackie , are you all right ? I 'm okay . Hurry and run ! Run. I 'll deal with this . Don 't worry . Let me handle this man . Yes . Yeung-wan . What are you doing here ? To arrest rebels . Who is this ? He looks awfully familiar . He is my good friend . Yes . Don 't speak English in front of me . - Do you know who I am ? - Who ? - l am her fiancé . - Fiancé ? I 'm warning you . Don 't let me see you with my fiancé again . Wing , I have the freedom to make friends . Jackie , don 't mind him . Let 's go . Officer , the girl was passing out propaganda . She must be a rebel ! She 's Officer Tsao 's daughter ! Not a rebel ! We grew up together . My parents arranged our marriage even before I was born . Arranged marriage ? I thought you were opposed to this kind of marriage . I am , but if we share the same ideas and goals in life , I might still marry him . What if you don 't ? Then I will ... Say no . Say no ? Here is the place where l teach and meet with my classmates . Good-bye . The size of England is so small and China is so big . Yet as soon as the English threatened to fight , the Ching Government was so frightened , they gave Hong Kong up immediately . If this continues , then maybe Shenzhen , Guangzhou or even Hangzhou will become colonies of England ! Yes , you are exactly right . What are you doing here ? I ... I brought him here . This is where we discuss serious business . How can you bring in an outsider ? I trust him . And I want him to join us in our efforts to save the country . - l want to join very much . - You want to join us ? Then you must cut off the braid on your head first . Cut my braid ? Why ? Every club has its rules , and that 's just one of our initiation rules . You all have braids ! We ... This is a national shame ! We have to cut it . No , I cannot cut mine . Are you afraid of execution ? Of course I 'm afraid of execution , but I 'm even more afraid of my father . We may be beheaded ; our blood may flow , but we 're not afraid of even the Emperor or the Empress Dowager . And you 're afraid of your father ? - Are you going to cut or not ? - No . Actually , cutting the braid is only symbolic . A great man once said : To save the country , we must wake up the masses and expel the foreigners . Right , right . This theory is so right . Brownnoser ! - Do you even understand ? - Yes . I don 't really understand . Why isn 't he back yet ? Have you seen all your patients already ? Hawk-man , do you understand or not ? Understanding is not understanding . Understanding is understanding . Not understanding is misunderstanding . You open this door now . Do you hear me ? He 's totally confused . I just checked on Hawk-man . He ... he stayed up studying all night . Now he has the flu . Flu ? Better not let it turn into pneumonia . So don 't go in there to bother him . Go get him his medication instead . Hurry ! I 'm on my way now . - Stop reciting . Where is he ? - l don 't know . Mother . What took you so long ? You almost got me into trouble . You 've been gone for over half a day ! Now tell me . Any progress on your rat-catching ? Not really . Oh , Mother . What does " " say no " " mean ? That means rejection . Why ? Did Rose say no to you ? No . Mother , can you teach me English ? What brought this on all of a sudden ? Rose and her classmates are always speaking English . And I don 't understand a word of it . Now I realize how big the outside world is , and there is so much to learn ! That 's right . There is no end to learning . You want to learn English ? No problem . You can count on your mother . He is my father . He is my " " flour . " " Repeat after me . He is my father . He is my father . Hmm ... passed . She is my mother . She is my " " mudda . " " Mother , I 'm not so bad , right ? No , you 're not so bad . You 're REALLY bad ! Son , I didn 't scare you , did I ? You 're worse than Father ! I have to if you really want to catch the rat . Do you understand , son ? I understand , Mother . But don 't just teach me " " she is my mudda . " " What would you like to learn ? Teach me how to say " " ngo oi nay " " in English . That 's my boy . " " Ngo oi nay " " is ... I love you . I love you ... Rose . Mother , was I right ? Right . Right . I hope you don 't completely forget about your mother when you have a wife . An empty room is lighted only by an opium pipe . Two shoulders hunched back in a corner . He does not know when his next meal will come . His clothes for all seasons have long been sold . Hurry up . Move ! Faster . Faster ! Little girl , don 't make so much noise here . Why don 't you make noise in my bed instead ! What are you doing ? Roundabout Lotus . Palm in the Face . Great , Jackie ! Good as Sealed . Wild Horse Stance . Yang 's Tai Chi ? Jackie , watch out ! That 's amazing ! No wonder he didn 't want to cut off his braid ! Yes . What are you afraid of ? Opium ! Get lost ! Get lost ! What 's going on ? What 's all the commotion ? Arrest all the troublemakers ! Daddy , the tea leaf boxes are full of opium ! Opium ? Move ! Move ! Jackie , are you all right ? I 'm fine . What 's going on ? You 've just earned a medal of merit . You have uncovered the foreigners ' conspiracy . Me ? I heard there was a commotion at the pier. I am here to secure the area . You may leave now . I am the Customs Officer . Someone is trying to smuggle opium here . I cannot just walk away . I am afraid this is over your head . The Great Britain West Indian Company is behind my boss . Can you afford to mess with them ? Wise up . Just go home and pretend you saw nothing . I will take care of everything here . Many eyes are on us . We have to do the right thing . Move the tea leaves into the warehouse . What are you going to do ? Burn the opium ! Burn the opium ! Good . Daddy , good job ! Let 's go ! The opium was taken away by the Customs Officer right from your hands . You 'd better get them back for me . Don 't say I haven 't warned you . Mr. Smith , if you must , you should blame your two goons . They started the trouble at the pier . Troublemakers were those on the pier calling for people to quit opium . They were obviously against me . You should have them all arrested . How dare you threaten an official ! I will have you arrested ! Arrest me ? Even your Empress Dowager bows before us Englishmen ! A martial arts scholar like you means nothing . Let me tell you . You are standing on Chinese soil . Your arrogance and illegal dealings will not be tolerated . Follow me to the court ! Mr. Smith , I will take care of the opium business . Good day . Brother Wing , let 's go . Brother Wing , let 's go ! What are you all doing ? Master , please allow your students to bow before you . I am not good enough to be your teacher ! I have not studied abroad , and I didn 't cut my braid . It was a good thing you didn 't cut off your braid . Please teach us your Braid Stance . So we no longer need to worry when we 're walking in the dark . And we no longer need to run for our lives when passing out flyers . But ... all your braids are fake ! I 'm afraid learning the Braid Stance is impossible . It 's all your fault . You told us to cut our braids ! Master , our braids are real . You can teach us . All right . But learning the Braid Stance is not easy ! What do we have to do ? I have put in over 10 years of hard work and serious studying . We will too ! Master , we will work hard too ! Good . Then let 's get started . " " The sutra of three words . Create new ideas . Learn scientific knowledge . " " If you don 't study hard. you won 't be able to learn the Braid Stance . " " Uncover the truth . Not afraid of sufferings . " " I didn 't know you are so good with children . Did you really learn the Braid Stance this way ? Yes . Actually. I should really thank my father . Stick in hand. he pushed me to study hard since I was very young . He 's made me what I am today . Do you have a good relationship with your father ? Not at all . We rarely talk . But he really sacrificed a lot for me . I am very grateful to him . My dad is good to me too . except we have a generation gap . I hate it when he smokes opium . but he can 't quit . My father was best at helping people quit opium . Do you know how ? Sure. it 's not that hard . Daddy . Jackie has come to visit you . Uncle Tsao . Rose. you 're good at choosing boyfriends . Daddy. what are you talking about ? I brought Jackie here to treat you . Treat me of what ? I 'm not sick . See how strong I am ! This is your sickness . Give that back to me . You call this sick ? Take one puff and you 're in seventh heaven . That kind of pleasure you simply don 't understand . Jackie . Let me show you what pleasure is . Once you give it a try. you will not want to let go. lt 's wonderful ! No. thank you . I go here. you go here . I go there. you go there . Follow me . Come on . Over here. over there . Jackie. be careful ! Don 't hurt my father . Don 't worry . He 'll be fine . What kind of kung fu is this . Jackie ? My hand is stuck to you . This is Tai Chi 's Gluey Stance . Once I 'm glued on to you . you can 't shake me off . I can 't believe you 've learned this at your age . Please have a seat . Uncle Tsao. please pardon me . If you learn this kung fu . you will have a long and happy life . Now. relax . Close your eyes . Close your eyes . Relax . That 's right . Close your eyes . That 's right . What are you doing ? What kind of kung fu is this now ? This is Jackie 's family 's exclusive Quit Smoking Stance . What ? You 're trying to make me quit smoking opium again ? Uncle Tsao . Rose only wants what 's good for you . Opium is harmful . and once you 're addicted to it . you 'll really go to heaven ! That 's right . Daddy . Opium is even prohibited in England . They sell them in China to poison our people . As a prohibition officer . you should set an example for others . Don 't you understand ? It 's easier said than done . Ever since your mother passed away . I only have you and my pipe left . You 're not always by my side . Without my pipe . I really don 't know how to make it through the days . Fine. lf you need the pipe . then you don 't need me . It 's your call . If you choose the pipe . then I 'll go back to America . Stay where you are ! Where are you going ? Back to America . I 'm never coming back . You come back here ! Of course. I 'll choose you . For this daughter of mine. I 've already tried to quit so many times . Are you sure this works ? Sure. it works every time . Don 't worry . Then how long do I have to be tied up ? That depends. it could be as little as three to five days . or as long as three to five years . Three to five years ? Then ... Daddy. are you going back on your word ? No ... no . I was just thinking . if this really works . maybe Jackie should work on my soldiers too . Good idea ! Jackie will discipline and reform your armed forces . Okay ? Yeah . Jackie. let 's go . Okay . Gather your strength like the bow . Then release your punch like an arrow . Look at yourselves . How can you protect your country like this ? Miss. you 're only watching . You have no idea how difficult it is . I know you 're going through withdrawal . Look at you . You can 't even hold up your opium pipe now ! When we practiced with Officer Tsao. he would usually take a few puffs with us . If you let us take a couple of puffs . I guarantee you we 'll be as fierce as tigers . Shut up ! Jackie. take care of them . Listen . Officer Tsao has brought me in to treat you . If you 're smart . drop your opium pipes . Otherwise . Officer Tsao will be your good example . Yeung-wan . Why have you come here ? What is he doing here ? Daddy invited him here . Rebel . For Yeung-wan 's sake . I let you go last time . Now here you are again . trying to swindle your way through . Mr. Lam. I have been to school too . I don 't think I could live up to the word " " swindle " " . Pardon me . What are you doing ? Nothing. I was just testing him . You got some nerve . Let 's go over there . Fine . Keep it up . Jackie . What are you looking at ? Why are you here ? Have you forgotten ? What is it ? It 's my birthday in two days . Really ! I 'm throwing a party . I hope you can come . Sure. I 'll be there . Yeung-wan . Let 's have a seat . You always keep company with those poor classmates of yours . And carry on about saving the country with democracy and science . Do you know you can be beheaded for this ? I know . We don 't share the same beliefs and goals anymore . - lt just doesn 't feel right . - Not right ? You 're saying you don 't feel right with me anymore . but you feel it 's right with him ! What are you talking about ? You 've completely changed . You bury your conscience . You and your brother conspire with the foreigners to smuggle opium . Don 't put my brother and I together . I have nothing to do with his opium smuggling . I only want to get ahead and make my ancestors proud . I want you to be able to enjoy wealth and comfort. lt 's all for you . Don 't talk anymore . If you keep it up . I don 't think I 'd even want to come to your party anymore ! All right . I 'll let you cool off . I hope to see your happy face at the party . Rose. what is it ? Nothing . Did I cause a fight between the two of you ? No . Do you know how to dance ? Sure. I know the Chinese tea dance . Not tea dance. lt 's tango ! Tango ? Never heard of it . Maybe you can show me ? Okay . I 'm back ! You 're early . Frying fish . Mother ? Look at you . You 're all smiles . Did you catch the rat ? Rose took me to her house . She even asked me to be her partner at a party ! That 's good news . I 'll be a grandmother soon ! Mother. you 're way ahead of me . Rose wants me to " " tango . " " but I have no idea what it is ! You 're in luck . Your mother will teach you everything . Slow. slow. quick. quick . Slow. slow. quick. quick . Son. did you watch closely ? Mother. please teach me . Come on. I 'll show you . Slow. slow. quick. quick . Slow. slow. quick. quick . Did I step on you ? I 'm fine . One more . Again . Slow. slow. quick. quick . Turn. turn. turn . Mother. let 's stop . Why ? You 're going to hurt yourself . I 'm fine . If you step on me again . I won 't make a sound . Come on . Again . Turn . Hold my hand . Good . Slow . Ouch . Slow . Slow . I 'm sorry . Did I do it again ? Ouch . Watch it. okay ? What are you complaining about now ? You asked for it . You just know how to pour salt on wounds . Me ? Do you think your son would be as good to you ? That 's true . You are good to me . Now massage here . That feels good ! I know . There 's something I don 't want to keep from you . Today. your son was in a fight with the bodyguards of a foreigner . Fight ? Did they break his arms and legs ? That you don 't have to worry . Let me tell you . It was one against many. and he defeated the foreigner 's bodyguards . He even uncovered the foreigner 's conspiracy to smuggle opium and became a hero in Hangzhou . What ? He fought with the foreigner 's bodyguards and came back in one piece ? How did he do it ? Who is it ? What are you doing here ? You don 't even recognize your old man ? Great Kick of the North ? You were defeated by my father . Are you too embarrassed to show your face ? You have no manners . Let me teach you a lesson . You come down . You come up . You don 't want to come down ? Are you planning on spending the rest of your life up there ? I 'm coming down. I 'm coming . I 've changed my mind now . If you 're so good . why don 't you come up ? What are you looking at ? Make your move . Can 't hit my own son . Why did you stop ? You think you can get around with your kung fu ? I didn 't know that besides your dog 's kick . you also have a pig 's claw ! Little bastard . watch your tongue ! Your parents didn 't teach you any manners ! Stomping Fists . Grounding Punch . Continuous Punches . Kid. let me teach you . White Snake Stance . Rolling Stance . Phoenix Stance . White Crane Stance . Under Punch . Darn. I overdid it . How do you know Tai Chi Fists ? You are so ignorant . Your father is not the only one who knows Tai Chi Fists .

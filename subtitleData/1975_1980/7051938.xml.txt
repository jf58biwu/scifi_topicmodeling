 Sensor readings growing stronger . Object 's course and trajectory holding steady . Positive analysis , sir . Object approaching us artificially powered . A ship ? Eagles One and Two . Maintain your approach . Check , Commander . - The scanners have picked it up , sir . - Eagles One and Two . Activate on board defensive systems . We 're picking up a signal , Commander . Relay it to us , Alan . - Kano ? - It 's some sort of call sign , Commander . Acknowledge it . Two seconds to visual . Message coming through , Commander . This is the voice of Voyager One . Our Ship is unmanned and unarmed . We come on a mission of peace and goodwill . It 's a Voyager Ship ! Carter ! Abrams ! Pull away ! Pull away ! Both men under severe stress . Eagles One and Two . Do you read me ? Do you read me ? Eagles One and Two . We 're under attack , Alpha ! Eagle One ... turning ... back ! Eagle Two not responding ! Eagle Two ... out of control ! The ship it 's falling apart ! This is the voice of Voyager One . Greetings from the people of planet Earth . We 've lost ship to base communication . Getting no life signs . I hope it 's their instruments . Paul , keep all communications open . This is Main Mission to Eagle One . Are you receiving ? Are you receiving ? Alan ? Do you read me ? Do you read me ? Alpha , how am I doing ? Your automatic systems are shot to hell . Can you maintain manual control ? Yeah , I think so . Abrams . Did he make it ? Sorry , Alan . - What hit us ? - The Queller Drive . Voyager One is powered by the Queller Drive . An atomic engine used for going across space at incredible speed . Yes . Incredible speed produced by fast neutrons spewed out into space , annihilating everything in their path . You 'd survive better standing smack in the middle of a nuclear explosion . Hey , John . Listen to this . It 's all here . Voyager One . Launched nineteen eighty five mission , to probe the galaxy for signs of intelligent life to find habitable solar systems to make man 's presence known in the galaxy . And now Voyager 's coming back ! After fifteen years ! Wow ! What a staggering achievement ! If it comes too close we 'll be burnt up . If it ... - Now , wait ! - ... passes at a distance we 'll be polluted by neutron fallout and we 'll die anyway . We 've got to blast it out of the sky , Commander ! Of course I understand there 's danger from the Queller Drive ... Danger ? Even if we climbed into lead caskets under twelve feet of concrete we 'd still be burned up ! Bu .. but you don 't understand what scientific information there is in that ship ! Wait a minute ! We have to think of our lives . - That ship has to be destroyed ! - But not without ... John ? - Kano . What 's the time factor ? - Limited safety .. eleven hours . Eleven hours . That gives us some time . Time ! Time for what ? We have no protection . We 've got to stop it ! - No . At least let 's ... - Eagle One coming in on approach course . I think I can make it . Eh ! Keep your heads down . Just in case . We 've waiting for you , Alan . Good luck . Crash units stand by . Emergency crew to launch pad four . All right , Victor . Now , what are you suggesting ? Just this . We 've got to get hold of the information Voyager has . We can 't just blow it up out of hand . Helena ? We can 't take any chances with the Queller Drive . We know what it does ! Listen . For fifteen years Voyager has been photographing other planets analysing atmospheres , detailing all forms of life recording gravities , temperatures think of all the medical information it must have ! Why , it would take a hundred years to learn what Voyager already knows ! I understand that . Look , I 'd love to get my hands on that information it could be invaluable in relation to our survival . But we can 't just ignore the Queller Drive ! Wait a minute . Victor . Voyager has two engine systems , right ? Exactly . There 's ordinary chemical rockets , which are used for lifting off and landing and the Queller Drive which takes over to carry it across vast distances of space . The Queller Drive made star travel possible . That Voyager is unmanned so how does it switch from rocket power to Queller Drive and back again ? - It 's computer controlled . - Exactly . Now why can 't we reprogram the computer aboard Voyager ? Why can 't we feed it new instructions so it shuts down the Queller Drive ? Because we can 't risk it ! Surely we can 't afford not to . - Commander , Eagle One is down . - Carter ? Still in one piece . - Good . Take him to the Medical Section . - Yes , sir . Helena ... You mean you 're going to try to save Voyager ? At the risk of all our lives ? All right . Well I guess we should try to find all the information we can about fast neutrons . Helena . - We 're not in any danger yet . - Not yet . The problem is to get access to the Voyager command circuits then we can give the computer new instructions . Kano . We need a link up through our computer programmer to Voyager One . - See what you can do would you ? - Yes , Professor . You 've heard there 's a Voyager ship out there ? - Did you hear what I said ? - Yes . You 're going ahead about things you don 't understand . When she went up you were still ... how do you say ? Still .. in .. short trousers . Yes .. I was . They 're playing games with the Queller Drive just like Voyager Two . All over again . They 've remembered nothing ! You know what they 're trying to do ? They want to stop it , shut down it 's drive . They can 't do that . Voyager One . This is the voice of Earth Space Authority . - Do you acknowledge ? - Acknowledged . Stand by to allow access to your command file . Request refused . This is the voice of Earth Space Control . Acknowledged . Voyager One . Delete your command file and stand by for fresh instructions . Request refused . - On what grounds ? - Unauthorised instructions . You are ordered to delete your command instructions . Request refused . Prime directive cannot be altered unless preceded by delete code . It 's just not interested , Professor . There 's got to be a way to crack it 's delete code . There is a way , Professor . Commander , Professor , one moment . Please , I will try to explain to you very simply . First , you must understand that the command controls will respond only to the most precise signal . Therefore I have to warn you that any random attempt to stop the Voyager by other means could trigger off it 's own destruct mechanism . How do you know that ? I have ... ah ... some knowledge of the subject , Commander I was involved quite closely with the Voyager project . In what capacity ? If you ... if you check my personal index you 'll find that long before I came to Alpha my name my name was Queller . - Ernst Queller . - That is correct . I have designed the Queller Drive . Ernst Queller ? He was Queller but his name was changed to Linden by Earth command ... - ... before he was assigned to Alpha . - And no one knew . He was cleared for duty here on Alpha . If he chose not to reveal who he was , that 's his business . I feel every man is entitled to that much privacy . He may have changed his name but nothing can change what he did . His Queller Drive killed Steve Abrams , remember ? That 's one more to the score . But I 'm thinking of fifteen years ago . The second ship on the programme , Voyager Two . The Queller Drive cut in too soon . Paul . Something went wrong . Two hundred people were killed because something went wrong . A whole community wiped out ! My father was one of them . I know something went wrong . Paul . I understand why this is difficult for you . But we 're not here to pass moral judgement on Ernst Queller . We 're here to decide whether a man named Ernst Linden can help us . You would put the survival of Alpha into his hands ? Victor , can you guarantee that you can shut down the Queller Drive in time ? Guarantee ? No . Let 's talk to Linden . Doctor . Doctor Linden . We need the information the Voyager contains . I want to know if you can shut down the Queller Drive so we can get that information . Now , don 't be hasty . Think carefully . I want to know if you can do it with the facilities we have here on Alpha . I want to know if you can do it in the time period we have left . - Kano ? - Nine hours , ten minutes . Yes , or no ? I am theoretically certain it is possible . Yes , or no ? Commander Koenig . Twenty years ago I would have given you my guarantee ... but .. now , today , if you asked me to undertake such a task all I can say is I can do everything I can , I will do my best . Thank you , Doctor . I 'm going with him . Paul , I don 't want his real identity made known . Not even to Jim Haynes ? He lost both his parents because of Queller . He should know who he 's working with . Should he ? Doctor , this has gone beyond me . I simply cannot understand what you 're doing . Ah , never mind , Jim . You are a very good assistant . Go back to the days when you were a student . Certain factors have to be taken on trust . So , in this crisis , once again , factors have to be taken on trust . You must do exactly as I tell you . I need your help . Ah , Doctor . I 'm afraid this isn 't really my field . I did do a bit on neutrons , but that was a few years ago . - So , I 'm afraid , this is about the best I can do . - Ah , thank you very much . - Make any progress ? - Oh , yes . As you know this failure of the Drive to cut out in time as planned when approaching inhabited areas has occurred before , with the most horrendous results . Oh , yes , indeed . You must have thought of it a great deal since . Ah , Victor . I have been over the possibilities in my mind thousands and thousands and thousands of times . I am now confident that I know the reason for the failure . - Therefore I must gamble and work from the premise that I am right . - Of course . Sandra . Let me know if there is any deviation in it 's flight . - It is being monitored constantly . - Fine . Alan . What 's your plan if we can 't stop it ? Well , it 's a three phase operation , sir . On the screen there . As soon as it enters the green area , the Eagles go on automatic alert . Now , if it enters the yellow area we move into positions here . And the moment it enters red we let loose with everything we 've got . Good . Paul , start the countdown . Haynes , if you 'll excuse us , I 'd like a word with the doctor . Oh , yes . Of course . Jim , those quartz components . They should be ready by now . - How much longer ? - I believe not long . Once the circuit pattern here is complete we can override the command instructions . After that it will be a relatively simple business to shut down the Drive . - Possibility of failure ? - I believe none . You see , I have designed the Queller Drive . I know what is required . All I need is time . - Do you need more men ? - No . Doctor . I hope you 're not trying to prove something . Eagles Six , Nine and Ten . Launch positions . Eagle Six . Ready for launch . Eagle Ten . In position . - Eagle Nine . Ready . - All Eagles now ready for launch . Eagles Six , Nine and Ten . Condition Yellow now operative . Go ! We 're watching you . Good luck . One hour to interception . Alan . Go ahead . Alpha base to Eagles Six , Nine and Ten . Intercept positions . Victor . No word from Linden yet ? I think we have done it . I think we have done it ! Switch on , please , Jim . Ah ! Good ! Good ! The circuit 's complete . Now we can override the on board computer . Security codes are irrelevant . All we need is the computer link up and we can shut down the Drive ! Override the on board computer ? Security codes irrelevant ? How did we do that ? Doctor . How did we complete the circuit pattern ? You don 't understand , Jim . Together we have recreated the control pattern for the Queller Drive . Shut up ! There 's only one man who could have done that . Only one man has the knowledge . You 're Ernst Queller , aren 't you ? Aren 't you ! Well , come on , tell me . You killed my parents , didn 't you ! How is he ? Fractured ribs . Shock . Bob ? Again . - How did it happen ? - Jim found out . Commander , I .. I didn 't intend this to happen . Do you realise what you 've done ? Stupid ! You 've destroyed our only chance ! - I 'm sorry . - It 's not his fault . Get out of here ! - Commander .. - Now ! And Voyager ? We can 't save it now . I still believe we can . Doctor , right now I 've got three Eagles out there their sights aiming right at Voyager . Please , do not destroy it , yet . You must .. You must give me a chance to finish what I have begun . You 're just trying to resolve a conflict that no one has a time to give a damn about . Commander Koenig ! Urgent . Main Mission . May I resume my work ? Helena . Do what you can to keep him going . All right . Three objects . Travelling a long way behind Voyager . Positive identification , sir . They 're spaceships . Flight path identical to Voyager One , and heading for Alpha . Here we go . Come on . I can 't give you any more of this . - You 're fighting a losing battle . - I told the Commander I can do it . I still believe that I can . You 're wasting your time . Voyager 's going to have to be destroyed . I can 't explain to you , doctor . You wouldn 't understand . Those ships are following the Voyager . Why ? Eagles maintaining intercept positions . Hold positions . Three minutes to intercept . Eagles to firing positions . Copy . - Lock weapons . - Locked . Voyager One now in space area red . Wait , Alan . Waiting for instructions to fire , Alpha . Commander ! We 've got to give the order , sir , now ! - Countdown minus fifty seconds . - I said wait . I am ready , Commander . Please , I will need computer link up . - It 's too late ! - Kano ! Link up ! Link up . Prime directive cannot be altered unless preceded by delete code ... by delete coee ... Good luck . Eagle Five to base . Voyager One in descent position . You gave me a chance , Commander . I am very grateful . So am I , Doctor . - Where would you like Voyager to land ? - Launch pad four . Alan , keep those Eagles in position . Paul , I want Voyager One ready for boarding as soon as she lands . All right , Doctor . You 've done your work . Come along . Let me do mine . The Voyager 's ready for boarding . Stand down , Eagle Five . Those three alien ships are still closing on us . Alan , keep watching the alien ships . Victor ? Doctor ? My former colleagues . We were all rather young at the time . Quite safe , Commander . No problems . It really is very strange to be back in here again . As you can see , she was originally designed to carry crews . Much later , of course , when man had developed his techniques for interstellar travel . But for Voyager it was not to be . Well , where would you like to begin ? Professor you should find a really astonishing collection of scientific information in the data bank here and also over there . - Commander . - Yes , Paul ? We 're picking up considerable magnetic activity inside Voyager One . Oh , impossible . Intensity building rapidly . John ? Who speaks for you ? I 'm John Koenig , Commander of this colony . John Koenig . You are communicating with Aarchon Chief Justifier of the Federated Worlds of Sidon . What is your purpose here ? Are you citizens of the planet Earth ? Correct . Do you accept responsibility for the primitive craft known as Voyager One ? On behalf of my people , yes . Then your colony , together with your world must bear the judgement of Sidon . Your craft , Voyager One intruded into the Sidon worlds of the outer galaxy . The mission was a peaceful one . False . Contact was made with two of our populated planets . Your primitive craft was welcomed according to tradition . Now , all life on those two worlds is extinguished . You came proclaiming peace and you wrought destruction . Only a debased culture could perpetrate such genocide . You must believe my people acted with the best intentions . The High Council of the Federated Worlds of Sidon has determined it will not happen again . We have followed the primitive Voyager One . As soon as we have located its source , the planet and all living things on it will be destroyed . - Revenge . - We do not recognise this concept . We believe that revenge , sanctioned by authority is also a sign of a debased culture . The judgement of Sidon is unalterable . Soon our fleet will be in effective range . Once we have located planet Earth your colony here will be extinguished . My people have committed no crime . We shall resist . Be warned . Resistance will alter only the manner of your destruction not the fact . We can 't just wait here like sitting ducks , let 's get in there first . By the look of those Sidon ships , I don 't think much of our chances . We 're going to give it a damn good try . Alan , move Eagles Four , Six and Ten into extreme intercept positions . Yes , sir . Oh , oh . Doctor Russell . How do you feel ? Very upset . Desperate , really . All these years believing I had helped further the boundaries of man 's knowledge . And now this this .. catastrophe . Doctor , many many people have put science before responsibility . Yes , of course , I know that , but the responsibility for what Voyager did to the Sidons I must bear alone . Two worlds made lifeless . Millions of people dead . I had no wish to harm them . To harm anyone .. They say the road to hell is .. ... Is paved with good intentions . And the road to heaven too , apparently . Anyway , it 's academic now . Well , John . There it is . That 's the memory bank from Voyager . It 's all there . Planets , compositions . Life support systems . Packed with vital information . Ironic that we might not get the chance to use it . If you were a betting man , John , how would you figure the odds ? Fifty-fifty ? Worse ? - A thousand to one . - Against ? I 'm not a betting man . What we need is another chance . I don 't reckon Aarchon 's going to give us that . No .. Visual contact . - Range ? - Seventy five thousand . Eagles Four , Six and Ten . As soon as the Sidon ships are within range .. fire . We 're ready , Alpha . Sorry . Please , Jim . I know you are much ber than I. But do not try to stop me . I 'm not trying to stop you . I 'm coming with you . No , Jim . You must realise , I have no choice . I have to go . And I have to go alone . He 's nowhere in the Medical Area . Fifteen thousand . Commander ! The Voyager ! It 's taking off ! Linden ... Linden , This is John Koenig ! Linden . Linden , do you read me ? What the hell is he up to ? Range : ten thousand . The Queller Drive . Signal from Voyager One . Linden . Commander Koenig . Activate all Alpha screens to maximum . Are you crazy ? We have no protection against that drive . - Recall your Eagles . - They 're all that stand between us and the Sidons ! On the contrary , Commander . The only effective thing between you and the Sidons is the Queller drive . He 's cut off ! Range : five thousand . All Eagle weapons locked and ready to fire . Range : three thousand . Range : two thousand . Recall all Eagles ! Eagles Four , Six and Ten . Return to base . But they 're coming into range now ! Return to base ! John Koenig , you are wise to recall your primitive fighting craft . In turn , the manner of your destruction will be merciful . Aarchon . Listen to me . This is Ernst Queller . I am the creator of the craft known as Voyager One . What is the purpose of this , John Koenig ? Ernst Queller is acting outside my authority . Your people have suffered greatly . Therefore-punish me . Do not condemn an entire world for the mistake of one man . My purpose was to unite a divided world to reach out in the name of science and humanity to illuminate the mysteries of space . ... to seek out other worlds and offer the hand of friendship . There can be no discussion , Ernst Queller . Aarchon . I have been guilty of pride and arrogance . It is I , and I alone , who am responsible for what my Voyager did . These other people .. are innocent . This plea is dismissed . John Koenig prepare to witness the judgement of Sidon . Then you , Aarchon , are no more worthy of life than I am . John Koenig . You have been warned . You do not appear to appreciate , that resistance is useless . Screens holding . Linden 's using the Queller Drive in short bursts . Look what it 's doing to the Sidons . It 's done it 's work . Why , Commander ? Why ? Good question . You work with a man you think you know him , you come to respect him ... And suddenly you don 't know him at all . Only his name was changed . The man the man was the same . Look , Haines . His sacrifice gave us a future . His knowledge ... hope . Now someone has to carry on his work . If you respected the man , don 't let that sacrifice be wasted . This is the memory bank from the Voyager . Get to it .

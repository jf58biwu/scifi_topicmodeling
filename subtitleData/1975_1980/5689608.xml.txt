 Good evening , everyone , and welcome to Houston , the Energy City , home of the defending Rollerball World Champions . This key international battle pits divisional champions , visiting Madrid , against powerful Houston . And here they come for a standing ovation . On the track comes Houston . Houston , led by captain Jonathan E. , again their leading scorer this year . Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Okay , right there . Let 's go . The controller indicates that he is ready , and our 30 Multivision cameras will be bringing you all the speed , thrills and excitement of this critical game . Ladies and gentlemen , our corporate anthem . The controller tests his computerized equipment , readies for the start of game action . The traditional firing of the test ball will signal we 're about set to go . The controller for tonight 's game , D.A. Niehaus . The officials have given their approval for play . Each team ... Come on , man . And now the crowd cheers once again as this Houston audience greets its team led by the storied athlete Jonathan E. Corral 's gonna break off . Okay , boys ! Okay . Houston ! Houston ! Now the play-by-play . Here 's RD . The computer counts down , one second , the ball ... First period is underway here in Houston tonight . The first team to pick up the ball will be on offense as they try for the score . And it 's a pickup by Houston . It 's picked up by BJ . Yay ! BJ moves it around the track . He 'll try to maneuver for the leading score ... Go on , go on . Watch it ! Jonathan E. holds the ball aloft . He must hold it out in plain view at all times . Pick them up ! Pick them up ! I got them ! I got it ! On your right ! On your right ! Now , baby ! Jonathan moves up the track and up on to the side . Here comes Sanchez for Madrid . Sanchez grabs Jonathan from behind , but off the rail comes Moonpie and takes out four Madrid men . The old swooper , Moonpie , with his favorite maneuver , made a move from the top of the rail and took out four Madrid men . The remaining Madrid skaters set up their defense in front of the goal . Jonathan still has the ball . Moving in , he 'll try to cover the slot , and surely does ! Jonathan in front , shoots , and it 's just wide ! Regroup ! The Houston team will have to regroup . Injured on the play is Belmonte , and he 's helped off the track for Madrid . First period , no score , as we get set for the firing of the second ball . Oh , and it hits the biker Carter ! Knocks Carter down ... Give me a hand . Move out ! Come on , look alive ! Jonathan is there , it is handed off , the pass is complete to Jonathan . He skates by and knocks him down again ! Did you see that penalty ? And the officials look this over ... Keep up . Keep up . Moon , on your left . On your left . Right , right , right . I got him ! Break it up ! Break it up ! Go , Jonathan , go ! Here comes Houston for the first goal of the game . He shoots , he scores ! Yeah ! And at the end of the first period , Jonathan 's goal gives Houston a one-to-nothing lead over Madrid . Houston goal scored by Jonathan E. The time , first period , 12 minutes . The ball is fired for the start of the second period . Madrid trailing by one goal , trying to go on offense to tie the score . Go , Madrid ! Watch your left ! Who did it ? Coming around the track ... Come on , Madrid , come on . Inside of the bike , he skates up in front . Gonzales still has it for Madrid . Hands off again , this time to Bodeas . Bodeas on offense for the Madrid team . Here 's the Houston defense in a four-man defense ... Shot ! It is cleared . And out of the pack goes Bodeas , but he 's all right , he 's not injured , but his scoring attempt failed . And the score is still one-to-nothing in favor of Houston . The ball is fired again . Madrid is pressing now , putting the pressure on ... Keep it moving ! All right , come on , let 's move it . We got it now . Sanchez is moving to his left and right , has a full head of steam , still going in on offense , trying to tie the score . Sanchez moves around the bike , takes a long look and shoots and he scores ! Sanchez scores with a play that ties the game at 1-1 . Second period . The ball is in play again , intercepted this time by Haskell . Three minutes . Get off . Madrid penalty . Three minutes , biking misconduct on number one , Meitzer . Are you satisfied , Madrid ? What kind of game are you guys playing out there ? Take it easy , take it easy . You 'll be okay . This crowd 's going wild , loving the wide-open action in this quarterfinal game . Skate ! Skate ! Come on , God damn it , skate ! Houston ! Houston ! All go down , pileup on the track , the ball rolls free and into the gutter . It 's a dead ball . Come here , come here ! Come on , block that side . Come on , move out . How is it , Jonathan ? - Give me a tie , will you , Bo ? - Sure . Come on , dude ! Three minute penalty . Hey ! Don 't give me any of that . Off the track . Off the track . Group up . Hold the line ! Hold the line ! Up and over the Madrid defense , gets up in front of the goal and he jams it in for the score ! Jonathan jams it in and scores to get Houston a 2-1 lead over Madrid . Houston with the ball again here in the third period . Stop it ! He has it . Jonathan behind the bike , coming in low with a great maneuver , he shoots , he scores ! That 's the way ! You got it ! I love this game , Moonpie . I love it . Yeah . So , we 've got two games left . Guess who we play first ? Tokyo . Now who would have thought they 'd make it to the playoffs ? They 're good . They 've got the old samurai spirit . Yeah , but they 're only about this tall . Yeah , well , two or three little things make one big thing . They 're liable to climb all over you and eat your lunch . I can 't get on a man-to-man basis with a pigmy or an oriental . I don 't know what it is . You were fine tonight , all of you . Mean . Sharp . Thank you . Your fellas did well again . Thank you , Mr. Bartholomew , sir . Thank you . You ? You rode . You really rode . Yeah . You play like our champion here . You take lessons from him ? No . We just give lessons to the other team . Yeah ! How are you , Jonathan ? I 'm feeling mean , Mr. Bartholomew . It 's good to see you . Jonathan E. That 's the name . Houston players come and go , but the champion plays on . Yeah ! The corporation has a hard time , Moonpie , figuring out ways to pay the champion properly . We can 't think up any more rewards for him . You 'd like us to have that problem with you , wouldn 't you ? Yes , sir . Like Jonathan , you play with abandon , but this is Jonathan 's season . Every season seems to be Jonathan 's season , but this year , we 've got you on Multivision . A special show all about you . No player ever had that before . The whole world will be watching , because this is your year . You got it , babe . So , two games left . That 's right , Mr. Bartholomew . New York in the final ! Team seems healthy , champion says he feels mean , no problems here . What is this , fruit juice ? Very healthy , Mr. Bartholomew , very healthy . Sweet dreams , Moonpie . It 's a bad habit you got there . You know what that habit will make you dream , Moonpie ? You 'll dream you 're an executive . And you 'll have your hands on all the controls , and you 'll wear a gray suit , and you 'll make decisions . But you know what , Moonpie ? You know what those executives dream about out there , behind their desks ? They dream they 're great rollerballers . They dream they 're Jonathan . They have muscles , they bash in faces . Let 's go . Can 't keep these boys here all night . Jonathan , come and see me tomorrow . Quiet , boys , quiet . This is a great team . A great city . Great stuff out there tonight . Jonathan ! Jonathan ! - Good morning . - How are you , sir ? Brutal game last night . Oh , thank you . Continue to hold my calls , all right ? Thank you . Come in , Jonathan . Keep silence with me for a minute , won 't you ? It 's important to have a place to think things out . You have your ranch . I know you take a lot of pleasure in it . I , uh , cut my finger . I 'm sorry . Here . You 've had an amazing career , Jonathan . You know how proud we are of the Houston team , and what we think of you , the energy ? But now , there are executives who want you out . Sir ? You 've had 10 years in this game , Jonathan . Longer than anyone , ever . Retire ? How can I do that ? On your special program . There are some who feel that this program should now be used to announce your retirement . Who wants that ? When this special was first planned by RCI Energy , we saw it as a good thing . Now the executive directorate wants a change . The program is scheduled , the whole world is waiting for it , so this does seem the perfect time . You know , the team , they , uh , they depend on me . Jonathan , let 's think this through together . You know how a game serves us ? It has a definite social purpose . Nations are bankrupt , gone , none of that tribal warfare anymore . Even the corporate wars are a thing of the past . I know that . It 's just ... So now , we have the majors and their executives . Transport , food , communication , housing , luxury , energy . A few of us making decisions on a global basis for the common good . The team , is a unit . It plays with certain rhythms . So does an executive team , Jonathan . Now , everyone has all the comforts , you know that . No poverty , no sickness , no needs and many luxuries , which you enjoy just as if you were in the executive class . Corporate society takes care of everything , and all it asks of anyone , or has ever asked of anyone , ever , is not to interfere with management decisions . I know . I don 't mean to resist . I 'm just trying to understand . This is for your own benefit . You must know that , Jonathan . All decisions concerning you are . Well , I , uh , lost Ella . The corporation took my wife away because an executive wanted her . I 'm not gonna review all that again . It was before I took over here , and I had nothing to do with it . And from what I hear , your wife wanted to leave herself . So , now you 're going to retire . That shouldn 't be too hard for you . It 's a stupid game , after all . Awful game . You ought to be glad to be out of it . I don 't ... I don 't know , Mr. Bartholomew . I just don 't know . I realize you had nothing to do with Ella leaving ... - Jonathan , I ... - But , um ... You 're right . I mean , I ought to do it . I ought to be perfectly happy to do what you say ... Take your time . Take a few days . You 've just come through a game . You 're tired . Go to your ranch , but think about it , and understand it . Do understand it . Because I don 't understand your resistance , and I don 't think anyone else will , either . Was your flight okay ? Yeah . Is Clete here ? He 's in the training room . I 'm gonna go say hello . - Jonathan . - Hmm ? Look what I got for breakfast . Hmm ? It 's a notice from the corporation . What 's it say ? Oh , that I should get out of here . You know , go away , vanish . That kind of thing . You know anything about that ? Yeah , I kind of heard something about it . You knew it was coming . We 've been together six months . Didn 't you even want to say goodbye ? We 'll talk about it later , okay ? You didn 't , did you ? Hmm ? You didn 't even want me here when you got back . I gotta go see Cletus . What do you want me to do in the meantime ? I want you to take it easy . Uh ... I want you to go in and fix us something to eat . Clete 's come a long way and I 'm hungry . All right ? Okay . Jonathan ? I 'm glad you 're all right . Come on . All right , come on . Come . I 'm tired enough . Yeah . Uh-huh . Well ... - I caught you , didn 't I , baby ? - Huh ? - Two games running . - What ? You did that in the last two games . Show the forward left . You 're standing on your left skate . Do that in Tokyo , they 'll take your arm home for lunch . You with me ? Okay . You practice that a little for me , huh ? All right . Hell , I forget which corporation is which . Any ass knows that fire 's energy . What about the music ? Where 's the music come from , huh ? Okay if I have one of these ? Go on , have all of it . I forget what corporation 's running what city . Chicago 's still a food city , but what about Indianapolis ? Whatever happened to that town ? Whatever happened to Mackie ? Yeah , things were much simpler when I was a kid . We still had three nations . That was before the corporate wars , even before rollerball . Before everything . You believe in kids ? I remember someone telling me about the National Football League and the World Cup . Where you going ? Indianapolis . What do you know about that stuff , Clete ? I mean ... Know how the corporations got started , about the corporate wars ? They were nasty ! Whoo ! But nobody talks about that . Well , except among friends . Yeah . I remember your rookie year . You were mean and tight . Best player I ever coached . Nobody could lay a hand on you that year . - Remember ? - Yeah . Look , I ... I gotta ask you something . It figures . Go ahead . I 'm listening . Well ... Something going on with the game . I don 't know what it is . I don 't think I 'm supposed to know . What 's that ? They want me to quit . And why would they want you to do that ? I don 't know . That 's what I 'd like you to find out . I can try . Hear just about everything going on in the game one way or another . That 's what I mean . I can 't think of another executive who 'd tell me a thing . Well , like I say , I 'll ... I 'll try . But I don 't think there 's much I ... Look ... No troubles for either of us , Clete . Just find out what you can . Well , trust me , Jonathan , you know you can . Sure . Sit down . Yeah . Nice , boys . Yo , Johnny . That 's the Houston stride . You boys want to make this team , play for Houston , you 're gonna have to learn it . We pride ourselves on being a power team . That 's right . We 're power . We 're mean . Now , that doesn 't mean to say we 'd like to have you hanging back there on a rail , in a fistfight , just standing there fighting somebody in section A when you 're supposed to be in section B. I 'm coming up to score , and you ain 't in the section you 're supposed to be in , don 't do us no good . Right . Who 's the two new catchers here ? Right . Give me that ball . Don 't , uh . Stick your hand in that gutter too quick . Wait till this ball comes down on the track . Don 't get too anxious . That thing will take your arm right off . Now , the bikers . A biker might sacrifice a little three-minute penalty and run over the top of a skater ... Uh-huh . If he feels that he 's skating a little too good that day . So we have a few methods here in Houston . There 's hundreds . One , of course , is to use this shield here . Use your pads . Use what you got . Drive that arm in there . Keep your feet forward . Hit and move . You get away from the wreck . Always keep your feet here . Don 't come across in here . You get all twisted . That 's sad . Or if a biker 's sitting up nice and high ... A lot of guys like to ride high . Drag one off them in there . I hurt you , Blue ? I wouldn 't hurt him for the world . Now , third method , kind of one that was perfected by a little friend of mine , the swoop . Swooper , that 's me . Hang up on the rail , use all the speed of the track , come down and drop-kick a biker . Say , excuse me . You 're not paying a whole lot of attention , are you ? Hey , what 's this dude 's name ? That 's our new speedball from Manila . Yeah , you know . You know , that 's Toughie . Come on up , Tough . Always a big honker . Say , why don 't you do me and the boys a favor , I mean , since you know everything there is to know ... We 'd sure appreciate it , I want you to give us a little demonstration . Show us how you made that big rep down there . Just skate around and just take me out , huh ? Go get him , Toughie . Now , eyes , use them . Don 't lock your eyes on any one spot . This game isn 't all in the muscle . Use your head . Lock your eyes on the target , keep ... Ears , now , they 're real important , too . If there 's anything I love , it 's luxury centers . When I get my privilege card , I know what I 'm gonna get me , too . Secretary . Why do you want a secretary ? Are you planning on becoming an executive ? I just need one . About this tall . Yeah ? Why don 't you give it a rest ? Hello . Can I help you , please ? Yeah , I tried to order some books , and they sent me this notice said I had to appear at the center personally . That 's right . This is our circulation unit . You can make your choice here or by catalog . There must be some mistake . The books you 've ordered are classified and have been transcribed and summarized . Well , who summarizes them ? I suppose the computers summarize them . What 'd you need books for ? Just want to study up on some things . You could go to the computer center where the real librarians transcribe the books , but we have all the edited versions in our catalog . Anything I think you 'd want . Well , let 's see then . This is not a library , and you are really not a librarian . I 'm only a clerk . That 's right . I 'm sorry about it really . And the books are really in computer banks being summarized . Where is that ? Well , there 's a computer bank in Washington . The biggest is in Geneva . It 's a nice place to visit . - Yeah . - I guess that 's where all the books are now . Yeah . Well , thank you . It 's not that exactly . Yeah , but books , Jonathan ? I mean , anything you want to know , you could hire yourself a corporate teacher , see ? I mean , you can call somebody up . Use your privilege card . I can 't . That 's just it . I feel there 's something going on . Somebody 's pushing me . Who ? Bartholomew ? But you 're Jonathan E. Everybody knows you . You 've got everything . You know you 'll be treated right . You always have been . Yeah . I don 't know . But I do know ! We 're living good . You know we are . I found this to wear . Is it all right ? That 's the uniform of the house . I 'm Daphne . Yeah . That figures . Well , that 's all right . Here . Wear these , too . That 's right , no penalties ! Limited substitutions . You can handle it ! Beat Tokyo ! All we gotta do is change our tactics . - That 's it . - Three times ... There 's always been rule changes . Now , look , you know that ! It gets more people to watch the game . That 's all there is to it . Look , you all signed contracts to finish out the season , no matter what the alterations in the game . Now every last one of you signed . See ? Now we all signed a contract . That doesn 't matter ! There 's no way we 're gonna lose , no matter how they change the game . That 's right . That 's right . All it means is a change of strategy . Now , we knock out the bikers early , we take care of their skaters . Don 't try to score yourselves . And the game 's yours . Now , you watch yourselves out there . They 're playing the same rules we are . It 's gonna be rough , but it 's still basically the same game . And the team with the power wins . Come on . Hey , Rusty . Hey , wait . Wait a minute . Hey , Rusty , come on . Listen . You were talking about them contracts . How come everyone else is being asked to play with the no-penalty rule , and they 're pressuring me to quit ? I don 't know . But can 't you do what you 're told ? For your own good , get out . I ... I don 't want to leave the guys to play Tokyo with the rules breaking down . I mean ... Jonathan , it doesn 't matter what you want ! Think about that . These we did in slow motion to show the impact of your blows on opposing players . Yeah , fine . We want you to approve the sequences . It 's , uh ... It 's all fine with me . Anything . I really don 't see why I 'm needed here . Well , the Energy people want you to be satisfied . Huh . There , now , isn 't that a marvelous shot ? Sure . I 'm a stat freak myself . Isn 't that perverse ? You got anything I can take ? Just ... Just take one . Statistics , huh ? Yes , the greatest number of points scored in a single game , 18 . The highest velocity of a ball when actually fielded by a skater , 120 miles per hour . Most deaths ... Please , don 't do that . Oh . Most deaths , nine . Rome versus Pittsburgh . December , last year . The greatest number of players and substitutes put out of action by a single player in a single game , 13 . A world 's record , courtesy of your dear self . There have been studies , you know , of stat freaks in rollerball . Well , some go to the track , but they never take their eyes off the big board . What 's this ? As for myself , I 've always wondered if a rollerball player sees himself as a class apart . " Hello . Pause . " I 'm Jonathan E. Smile . " I would like ... " Is this for me ? Very astute , yes . It 's your retirement announcement . Your special is already scheduled and announced all over the world . You 're supposed to read this as part of the program . What sort of pill did you give me ? Pure aphrodisiac , Daph . Enjoy yourself , dear . Can we finish up there and go home ? You are being recorded . Feeling a little woozy , are you ? Try to read the announcement . I 'm all right . Why don 't you read ... the ... Oh , you ... You want that , do you ? You are making things very difficult ... How many ... How many assignments you been on , Daph ? I know you 're good at what you 're good at , so , you must have been around some . A lot of girls have stayed with me but you know that . Never seem to mind . But odd thoughts I 've had about you , Daph , odd thoughts . I wondered if you 'd been briefed on me . I 'm going to have to ask you to read ... Yeah , a lot of things occurred to me , Daph , a lot of things . A lot of things occur to you ? You look terrible . You do look terrible . Come on . See , you shouldn 't take anything offered to you just like that . What was in it ? Nothing to hurt you . Maybe you 're just a little too trusting . You ever think of that ? And hook ' em deep now ! I 'll do that . Thank you . As you know , the Tokyo game is coming up . And you 'll remember that the Tokyo team uses various karate and hapkido techniques . We will review these techniques with special attention to the use of death blows . Same lecture every year . There are certain body areas that the skilled opponent will endeavor to strike ... What we got for our skilled opponents is the old Houston fist-in-the-face technique . Right ? Especially in a game with no penalties ... You got to get mad , all right ? Play hard ! It don 't matter that they 're all tiny little men on that team . Especially in a game with no penalties and limited substitution . Get mad and fly ! Please ... Now , there 's certain body areas that I know about , too . Now , what we gotta do is hit those guys in the ganglion . Where ? In the ganglion . It 's a mess of nerves right here under the ear . Now , what you gotta do is drive the jawbone up in that mess of nerves and it rings a bell . You must understand . The Tokyo team has a very eccentric playing style . And no penalties , all right ? If I go down , I know my team is with me ! - Right ? - Please ... Brute speed ! Familiarize yourself with the basic fighting art techniques . And nobody is gonna take us , rules or no rules ! Go on . Go on . This is the Houston team ! Rules or no rules ! We fight for each other ! Houston ! Houston ! They 're really quite beautiful in a wild kind of way . I can almost smell the lions . Don 't be silly . They 're made in Detroit . Yes , they 're androids . They 're all programmed . That 's right . The whole game is played by robots . They look like men , and they ... Not so loud . They 'll hear you . It 'll ensure stability , expansion and high profits for the planetary enterprise . What do you think about it ? Exciting . You make it sound absolutely romantic . He 's gorgeous . Absolutely gorgeous . I know and he 's so intelligent . We 're practically living on krypens . Hey , there he is . Hey , Johnny boy . Hey , kid ! Come on , well , let 's hear it ! Come on . Give me a hand here . Give me a hand , will you ? Behave yourself . Hello , Mackie . Well , how you been ? You know , it 's your night tonight , Jonathan . You having a good time ? Well ... Well , I 'm glad you 're here . I 'm here with an executive . He asked all about you . He wanted to know if I enjoyed you . Hey , Rocky . Hey , come here and give me a hand . Get on over here . There 's too many of them . Well , what about the new game ? Actually , I haven 't heard much about it . The rule changes were announced a week ago . - That so ? - Who changed them ? That 's what I 've been trying to find out . Look , rules or no rules , it 's still the same game . What I 'm really looking forward to is the program . When you see that screen replay afterwards ... Excuse me . Did you hear about Evans ? What ? He 's out . Gone . No kidding . The old man ? Who got him ? - What ? - I said who got him ? The Crocodile . Hey. do you like poetry ? Mmm-hmm . Let 's go upstairs ? I got a poem for you . Ooh . Welcome , sports enthusiasts everywhere . Tonight , Multivision trains its cameras on the amazing career of Jonathan E. In those years that Houston began to mold itself into a world championship team with the attacking style of their lead scorer ... Jonathan , come on . Come on , come on . Jonathan E. , has always been the team 's strongest asset . Yes , the game seems invented for him . Defense ! Defense ! Defense ! Defense ! Defense ! Defense ! Right on ! Look , I talked to everybody I could . And there is something going on . Yeah , you ... You 're right about that . Nobody will talk about it . I mean nobody ! It 's hard finding anything out , Jonathan . You know that . Hell , nobody even knows the names of the men on the directorate anymore . Look , I 'm sorry , I ... They want you out . You know that . Yeah . Well , do you know who they are ? Bartholomew , I guess . Mmm-mmm . Above Bartholomew . It 's the Executive Directorate . Why are they worried about me ? It 's what they do . They 're even after the old man because he didn 't get your retirement announced tonight . How come they put the program on without it ? I think they had to . They didn 't want to . It 's very tricky . Jonathan , look ... There 's one thing you ought to know . Look , nobody said it , but I 'm sure of it . Hmm . They 're afraid of you , Jonathan . All the way to the top , they are . What are they afraid of me for ? Oh , no . Don 't go yet . We 're showing some replays . Well , let 's see ' em then . Let 's see ' em . Mr. Bartholomew would like to see you now . He 's in the study . Come on hurry up . Over there . You know I 've always considered your situation , Jonathan . And your needs . Now , you have to consider mine . And ours . I 'm considering it , Mr. Bartholomew . No player is greater than the game itself . It 's a significant game in a number of ways . The velocities of the ball , the awful physics of the track . In the middle of it all , men , playing by an odd set of rules . It 's not a game men are supposed to grow strong in , Jonathan . You appreciate that , don 't you ? More and more , Mr. Bartholomew . Shoot that statue . That 's the one . Shoot that ! Hey ... - The tree ! - Yeah ! Come on ! You must take good advice . You 're not to play against Tokyo , you 're not to play again . I want some concessions . Concessions ! Believe me , I 'd be happy to talk a deal , Jonathan . I love deals . But this situation is much , much simpler . This Multivision event tonight was very embarrassing . For me and for others . Well ... it might be I won 't ever find out why I 've been asked to leave the game . But I do know I can get some concessions and I want them . Oh , you missed ! I want to see Ella . My wife . Arrange it so I can see her again . That 's not easy , Jonathan . I want other concessions , too , Mr. Bartholomew . Oh ! Oh-ho ! Look at that ! Give ... By my life , that 's incredible ! - Oh ! - That 's terrific . Look at all those flames ! Specifically , you 're bargaining for the right to stay in a horrible social spectacle . It has its purposes , and you 've served those purposes brilliantly . Why argue when you can quit ? And you say you want to know why decisions are made . Your future comfort is assured . You don 't need to know . Why argue about decisions you 're not powerful enough to make for yourself ? Energy will treat you well . You know that . If the rule changes stay the same , Mr. Bartholomew , I 'm playing with my team . Too late . The rule change is scheduled and announced . There 's no going back . You 've seen to that . Then I 'll see you in Tokyo . You can be made to quit . You can be forced . You can 't make me quit . Hey , watch out ! Don 't tell me I can 't . Don 't ever say that ! I can ! You can be stopped ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Look , it 's all going too fast . I 'm not packed yet . Can 't you ... Forget it . You 're not going , Daph . Those bags are ready . Here . Hold on . Take this extra hat , will you ? Sir ? I 've had a call . I 've been asked to go over to Energy . You 're not going to Tokyo then ? What do you mean I 'm not going ? I suppose I will later . I hope this isn 't an inconvenience . No . No . It 's ... No problem . I 'm supposed to go with you . Well , what 's that mean ? Who ... Who told you you 're supposed to go with me ? Hmm ? Nobody told me . Listen , Jonathan , I really want to go with you . I do , really . You 'll need me . Just get yourself another assignment , will you , Daph ? Everybody is an assignment . Life 's an assignment . Here you go . You 'd better do as you 're told , Jonathan . That 's all I have to say . You threatening me ? Don 't be here when I come back . You won 't be back , Johnny boy ... Don 't try to frighten me , Daphne . You don 't know how . Look ... You go tell them people that I 'm going to Tokyo and you 're not , huh ? - You tell ' em . - No ! Ciao . Teller . Make sure my gear gets to the track in Tokyo . I 'm gonna travel with the team this trip . You call transportation and tell them . Yes , sir . Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! What chance does Houston have of defeating Tokyo tonight ? Well , both teams have fine players and different styles . What do you say , Moonpie ? Well , yeah , yeah , but ... But it 's not an even match , see . 'Cause the Tokyo team has all these little short guys . Tokyo ! Tokyo ! Tokyo ! Tokyo ! What about the rule changes ? Well ... At Houston , we kind of play a wide-open system . Will you comment , though , about playing in a game where the rules are always changing ? Game 's always had rule changes . They don 't affect the good teams . You 're a great new player . What 's the secret of your success on the track ? Oh , it 's no secret . I just imitate him . And plastic surgery keeps me beautiful . There are rumors that the last game of the season will be played without time limit . Any comments ? Well , I don 't think it 'll come to that . It 's still a game . There also are rumors , some say you 're retiring from the game . Here I am . Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Corporate society was an inevitable destiny . A material dream world . Everything man touched became attainable . Yeah . I 've been touched all my life . One way or the other . Either caressed or hit . It don 't like seem to matter which anymore . I guess that 's why I wanna see Ella again . See if I still feel things now . You know what I mean ? Yeah ... Here are some other things , too . I mean , they took Ella away from me . Now , they 're trying to push me out . And I 'd sure like to find out why . I think I 'll go to one of them computer centers . See what I can find out . Yeah .

Spread ! Go kill ' em ! Tokyo ! Victory ! Tokyo ! Victory ! Fall out ! Fall out ! Blue . This way , please . May I say first , please , that you played a superb game in our city . Thank you . A simple problem , yet I know it is difficult for you . Your teammate has no family we can contact , and permission is required now before consummating matters . So he 's technically dead ? Yes , unfortunately . His heart and lungs will function , but his brain is ... It has expired . From the first minutes we had him , it was hopeless . I believe this was explained to you . He 's warm . Yes . But if you will , please . You must sign a release form . It is required . Does he ... Does he dream ? No . There is no brain wave at all . No sort of consciousness . Just a deep coma . A vegetable . No dreams . Nothing . Well , even ... A plant feels something . Who can say ? Please . It ... Senses life . I mean , it turns towards the sun . It 's alive , isn 't it ? You must sign . You ... You just leave him the way he is . Just leave him as he is . Someone will have to sign . There 's no other way . Arrangements will be made . Please . There are hospital rules that have to be ... No , there aren 't . There aren 't any rules at all . Let me know if you have any problems . You won 't find any answers in Geneva . Take care of your arm . In my opinion , we are confronted here with something of a situation . Otherwise , I would not have presumed to take up your time . Once again , it concerns the case of Jonathan E. We know we don 't want anything extraordinary to happen to Jonathan . We already agreed on that . No accidents , nothing unnatural . The game was created to demonstrate the futility of individual effort . Let the game do its work . If the Energy Corporation has done all it can and if a champion defeats the meaning for which the game was designed , then he must lose . I hope you agree with my reasoning . Thank you , all . Will you follow me , please ? Hello , hello ! Yes , it is the famous Jonathan E. Oh , hard to believe . Sorry we 've never met . The Rollerball Champion . Wonderful . Not many people come to see us , you know . We 're not easy to talk to , Zero and I. We 're a little confused again in here today . This is embarrassing . It 's embarrassing to misplace things . Misplacing data ? Mmm . The whole of the 13th century . Misplaced the computers , several conventional computers . We can 't find them . We 're always moving things around , getting organized . My assistants and I. But this , this is Zero 's fault . Zero . He 's the world 's file cabinet . Eh , pity . Poor old 13th century . Well , come along now . You want to get started , don 't you ? - Yes , sir . - Mmm-hmm . - Oh . - Hmm ? This way . Now ... But we 've lost those computers with all of the 13th century in them . Not much in the century , just Dante and a few corrupt Popes , but it 's so distracting and annoying . You 've unlimited restrictions here , of course . You have to come so , so many times . It all takes such ... Such effort . Do the executives still come here ? Oh , they used to , some of them . What about the books ? Books ? Books ? Oh , no , they 're all changed , all transcribed , all information 's here . I mean , Zero , of course . He 's the central brain , the world 's brain . Fluid mechanics , fluidics . He 's liquid , you see . He 's water to touch . All knowledge . Everything we ask has become so , ah , so complicated now . Each thing we ask ... This morning , we wanted to know something about the 13th century . He flows out into all our storage systems . He considers everything . He 's become so ambiguous now . As if he knows nothing at all . Could you tell me something about the corporate wars ? Wars ? Wars ? Oh , yes , of course , we have them all here . Punic War , Prussian War , Peloponnesian War . Crimean War , Wars of the Roses . One doesn 't perhaps recall them in sequence , but corporate wars . Well , Zero will or can , I 'm sure , tell you anything . A memory pool , you see . He 's supposed to tell us where things are and what they might possibly mean . Look , Zero , a visitor . Jonathan E. , the Rollerball Champion . You 've filed away a lot of data on him . Do you remember ? Does it answer you ? Oh , yes . He speaks . He finds things . And loses them , and confuses itself . Ask anything . He 'll find it for you . A section on Bach ... Won 't you , Zero ? All right . I 'd like ... I 'd like some information about corporate decisions . How they 're made and who makes them . Zero ... You heard the question . Answer him . Negative . You don 't have to give him a full political briefing . Answer . Negative . This is Jonathan E. He has to know . Make it simple . Answer . Corporate decisions are made by corporate executives . Corporate executives make ... I know we have the answers . We do have . They 're the waters of history . Energy equals genius ... I don 't want to bully you . Genius is energy . Corporate entities control ... I shall have to answer ! Of economic life , technology , capital , labor , and markets . Corporate decisions are made ... You have to , Zero . Let 's show him policy . Negative . Negative . Negative . Negative . Negative . Negative . Negative . Negative . Hello , Johnny . Morning , Ella . Nervous . How are you ? I 'm ... I 'm all right , I guess . What are you doing ? Looking at you . Counting your scars . Yeah . Seeing how you 've changed . Oh , I mean , that 's ... That 's all I 've changed , huh ? Just a little more beat up . Oh , no . You 're just not ... Yeah , well ... Come on . You want a drink or something ? No , thank you . You have a lovely place . Well , thank you . Well , I 've seen your house . You have ? Yeah . When we , uh , played in Rome , I stood a block away and watched your front gate for a couple hours . I was just , uh , standing there wondering what your furniture looked like . What you said to each other in the morning . Yeah . What 's he like ? What 's he do ? Oh , he 's a city engineer . Ah . We have a jet copter . A son . Two cats , and a place in the Alps . Well , you don 't really want hear all of this . Son , huh ? Yes . We have a lot of friends . And he has a lover . We have furniture a lot like yours . Same taste in furniture , how about that ? Yes . You know , Johnny . All they want is a kind of incidental control over just a part of our lives . I mean , they have control economically and politically , but they also provide . You know they do . Provide , huh ? You know , they were responsible for taking you away . And I started to hate ' em . They weren 't . It was the game , Johnny . I mean , it was important to you . It was as if I wasn 't even there . You played . There was nothing else . I 'm sorry . You know I wanted you here . I mean ... This might sound all wrong , but , I mean , I was just trying to remember myself then . Yeah . Maybe it was love I wanted to try to remember . There 's , uh , a lot of things I want to talk to you about . Yeah . I 've been thinking , Ella . Been thinking a lot . And watching . It 's like people who had a choice long time ago between having all them nice things or their freedom . Of course , they , uh , chose comfort . But comfort is freedom . It always has been . The whole history of civilization is a struggle against poverty and need . No . No , that ... That 's not it . That 's never been it . I mean , them privileges just buy us off . Look . They want me to quit , Ella . Then quit . Just like that , huh ? But you 've got to do it now . You 've got to before it 's too late . Whether you want to or not . Look , Johnny , the next game there won 't be any substitutions allowed . And no time limit . You 'll die , Johnny . Everybody will die . No time limit . They tell you that ? Yes . They tell you to come here and convince me to quit ? Yes , but that isn 't why I came here . You have to get out for your own sake . Oh , please , Johnny , please . They tell you to stay if I did quit ? You my big reward ? You still don 't understand why I came here . You 're the only person I ever wanted . I wanted you on my side , that 's all . It 's like you 're a God now . Maybe you know what I don 't . I ... I 've been so stupid for so long . I 've been so stubborn . I don 't even know why . It scares me . You know , I 'm probably gonna ... Probably gonna die . And you 'll be in here pumping away long after I 'm gone . Hey , you ... You got it made , old buddy . Bluebonnets and everything . Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Houston ! Houston ! Houston ! Houston ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan 's dead ! Jonathan 's dead ! Jonathan 's dead ! Jonathan 's dead !

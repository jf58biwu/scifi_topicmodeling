 Something serious ? We 're just handing the fleet over to a bunch of criminals . .. two , one , zero ! There 's not much difference between you and your fellow convicts and us . We all live for the promise of freedom and fear the same death . Muffit ! Come back ! 'There are those who believe 'that life here began out there , 'far across the universe , 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans . 'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens . ' 'Launch bay Alpha , stand by to launch fighter probe . ' That man next to you is about to fly up your tailpipe . Cadet Cree ? You come any closer , you 'll melt your front end off . 'Our instructor said to keep tight . ' 'He 's at the base playing 7-11 . ' You are on a deep space probe . It 's not like a simulation . - ' Overheat and you evaporate . ' - Yes , sir . - It was too easy . Too easy . - What was too easy ? Our defeat of the Cylon attack force . Their sudden retreat was too easy . The Galactica was bearing down on them . Yes , so it appeared , didn 't it ? But what 's the truth ? I just have the feeling that we 're being carefully manoeuvred . We 're being herded into this safe passage ahead . Blue Leader to base . Small moon ahead . Can you give us a quick scan ? Base to Blue Leader . Scanner readout coming up . Commander ? - Yes ? - An object in Sector Sigma . - What 's the structure ? - Crystalline elements , table M-1 . - Surface ? - Frozen seas , fields of ice . Blizzard conditions and di-ethene storms . Environment - hostile . Nice place . Want us to orbit the equator ? - ' Stay out of its gravitational pull . ' - Will do . Lock in a holding pattern . Boomer and I will pick up a closer scan . 'Cadet Bow , you 're in command . 'OK , Boomer , let 's go . ' Lens system aligned . Pump system to speed . Pulsar ready to fire . Fire as targets bear . By your command . - Lock on target . - Locked . Shields , Cree , keep visual contact . Don 't cross to the dayside . I 'm picking up a brilliant bead of light , like an eclipse . I 'm checking it out . Fire . 'Bow , get out of there ! ' - Back off ! We 're coming up . - What happened ? 'He was picked off . An energy beam . ' Like a pulsar , only bigger . Much bigger . But we 're out of range . 'Blue Leader to base . We 've lost a ship . We 're coming in . ' Battle stations ! All ships , full stop ! Fighter control reporting . Squadrons standing by . Starbuck 's lost a ship . 'Cree , come in . Shields , where are you ? ' I got them . Just inside critical gravitational pull . Cree , Shields , come back . You can 't go down there . I saw where it came from . I 'm going after it . Do not enter the atmosphere . That 's an order . Both of you , turn back . - ' I 've locked on target . ' - Right behind you . Two fighter craft , Colonial . Entering defence perimeter . I want one of them alive . - We can 't let them go down alone . - ' We won 't see them in the clouds . ' Record the telemetry . We can see what they 're after . I got their visual . 'What is it ? ' Fire . - Shields ! - Too late . He 's gone . 'I 've lost Cree 's signal too . ' It 's there but it 's being jammed . Invaders , release control of your ship . - Starbuck , they 're forcing me down . - Hang on , kid , we 're coming . Two more fighter craft entering . Destroy them as they come into range . Fire as targets bear . 'We don 't stand a chance against that . ' We have to get back and warn the Galactica . 'Besides , we 'll never spot them with all this jamming . Starbuck ! ' Frack ! Fighter craft retreating . Thank you , Lieutenant . Put up the video scan , please . Good Lord . I have a fix on the scale . The ramparts are 14 metrons high . - Destructive power infinite in 2 hectares . - It could destroy us in a single pulse . Tell that to Cadet Cree ! - Sir . - You did the only correct thing . You returned with these scans . That 's why the Cylons have squeezed us in here . How long until their pursuit force catches us up ? We have too much firepower . They 'll hang back . - They 'll bring up their base ship soon . - Blue Squadron can take out that gun . It would be suicide to send a squadron . You 've seen what it can do . - And we cannot turn back . - No , we cannot . What 's left ? We can send a specialised task force down to the surface , probe for some weakness in their defence , destroy the weapon . Colonel ? Program a computer research for qualified personnel experienced in arctic survival and mountaineering , specialised in heavy demolition . Yes , sir . - What 's your name ? - Corporal Komma , sir . Well , relax , Komma . Incredible . You understand this felgercarb ? From Alpha to Omega . You 're a viper pilot , you understand some of it . At the Academy , if it didn 't have a control stick , I didn 't bother . Is there something you want , Lieutenant ? Captain Apollo and I were touring the tech levels with the new viper pilots . I just thought I 'd take a look in here . The female viper pilots ? Er , I believe they are females , yes . If you 'd like to meet them , they 're in the armament room . I 'll keep an eye on the equipment . I mean , if something flashed red , I could just yell . Nothing can go wrong . It 's doing a search for the task force to go down to the planet . Sure . Go on . - That 's an order . - Well , since you put it that way . - Four specialists and three support . - Lock it in . Commander . Starbuck , you and Boomer take them to the briefing room . - Aye aye , Captain . - Sir . Commander ! There must be some mistake . Most of these are criminals . They 're aboard the prison barge ... You have your orders , Lieutenant . Aye aye , sir . Something serious ? We 're just handing the fleet over to a bunch of criminals . As long as it 's nothing serious . Croft - commander of the snow garrison on the ice planet Kalpa . - Four of ' em raided a Cylon outpost . - There 's nothing illegal about that . Not a military operation . Armed robbery . They plundered a Cylon platinum mine . Wouldn 't surrender the bounty to the Colonial commander . He didn 't go in . He didn 't deserve any part of it . Who are you ? I like to know who I 'm with when I travel with bilge rats . - Viper pilots . Blue Squadron . - Commander Adama 's strike wing . - What 's the drill ? - You 'll find out soon enough . That computer sure knows how to pick ' em . Holy frack . Hey , hey . Wolfe , demolitions expert , snow garrison . A one-man task force . Not real talkative . Thane , an expert in alien environments . When people talk about me , I like to see their eyes . I work with breathing gear , rare gases , chemical blends . I can take you through land , air , fire and water . - Says here you 're in for murder . - Mm . That , too . She looks like she could take us all on , with or without chains . Leda , medic , first-class . An expert in laser wounds and arctic-experienced . - What 's the mission ? - Commander 'll brief you . To have Croft and me in the same place at the same time invites disaster . You don 't like him ? I 'm married to him . And no , I don 't like him . Weee ! A cosy little group . This is one mission I know that you are not going to volunteer for . There 's not much difference between you and your fellow convicts and us . We all live for the promise of freedom and fear the same death . Perhaps it was the chains that made the difference . Am I in full command ? Of the demolition unit , yes . Of the expedition , no . Three warriors will command you . The commander will be Captain Apollo , supported by two fine officers , Lieutenants Boomer and Starbuck . We 've picked up Cylon battlestars approaching on the long-range scan . They should reach our position in 8 or 900 centons . Whether the pulsar is destroyed or not , this fleet will move in exactly 700 centons . Good luck to all of us . I don 't understand how that computer picked you . I pulled a tour on Ice Station Thula , so it makes sense . But you - you get dizzy when your drink 's too cold . I wish you 'd told the Commander that . I 'd like some way to get out ... Hey , er , Giles , what are you doing ? Giles , what are you doing ? Colonel told me to pack up Cree 's personal effects . He 's not dead . You don 't stow a man 's gear until he 's dead ! - And he 's not dead ! - OK , he 's not dead . - Giles , I 'm sorry . - Just forget it , I know how you feel . Hey . Just tell the Commander you 're not qualified for this mission . Boomer ! You talk like I programmed that computer myself . Take him to Vulpa . Wave . Wave . Wave . Wave . Wave . Wave . Wave . You got him trained . - Muffit 's very intelligent for a daggit . - Come here , little monster . Come here ! Hey , Muffit , wanna see Boxey do a trick ? Let me up ! What do you mean ? I won 't let you up ! What a baby . What a baby ! Come here , I have to talk to you . I 'm going away for a while . - We don 't want you to leave us . - It won 't be for long . - Where are you going ? - An ice planet with Starbuck . An ice planet ! Can Muffit and I come ? We 've never seen real snow . Not this time . This is an important mission for the Galactica . - But I 'm a warrior ! - Yes , you are and we need you right here to protect the ship . Your orders are to do as Commander Adama says . - And say my prayers ? - And say your prayers . I have a very special mission for you . You see this medallion ? My father gave this to me when I graduated from the Academy . It 's very important to me . Could you hold on to it ? - Yes , sir ! - Yes , sir . OK , upsy-daisy . I 'll see you later , OK ? Too bad we can 't go on the ice planet , Muffit . - Watch your step ! - I 'm coming through . - Not through here ! - Take your hands off ! Wolfe , break it up ! Haals ! Wolfe ! Wolfe ! Back off . - How is he ? - He 's all right . It 's a temporary paralysis . - What did you use on him ? - Look at this . Don 't touch the switch ! It 's a hand mine . - Don 't use this on your own troops . - We 're not barge lice . - Or grid rats . - We are . We were picked because we 're expendable . Nobody 's expendable . You 're doing a job on the Cylons , not each other . Stow your gear and fasten your harness , we 're on countdown . 'Section 12 . Launch bay Alpha , stand by to launch probe . ' 'Acknowledged . Ready to launch . ' 'Transferring control to probe craft . Launch when ready . ' Entry tracks . - How many ? - Two . Order the patrol to intercept . Engage the pulsar . Pulsar ready to fire . Fire as target is there . Get a navigational fix before we penetrate the cloud . The surface could be pitch black , snow powder , pack ice . - Cylons ! - Dive for the cloud cover ! - They 'll outrun us . - I 'll block for you . This isn 't a fighter . You 'll overload the turbines . Tell that to the Cylons . Fire . Put on your breathing gear ! We 're going down ! Visibility zero ! Surface coming up on the instruments ! Counting down ! Four , three , two , one , zero ! 'We 've lost signals from both ships . ' - No reception ? None ? ! - Not on the viper channel . It 's dead . No lights . Telemetry indicates total destruct . - Who was it ? - Killian . - And the shuttle ? - The emergency channel kicked in . All reds . Telemetry indicates heavy structural damage . We could try on high band . No , maintain silence . We cannot reveal our position . One ship destroyed . One probable . Contact patrol leader . - ' Garrison command to patrol leader . ' - Patrol leader . This is Vulpa . Tracking reports one invader destroyed , one probable . 'The probable dropped into cloud cover , Sector Hekla . ' Search for wreckage . Leave no survivors . No survivors . - Boomer , you OK ? - Yeah . Hit the emergency lights . - Your head . - It 's nothing . Let 's get out ! You did a great job , Starbuck . The landing you always dreamed of , no engine , no instruments . - Grab a light ! - You 're one fine pilot . - How is he ? - It 's just a rap on the head . Look , don 't feel so bad . Anybody else would 've lost it all . - Apollo , get me the medical analyser . - Yeah . - What 's it look like ? - Broken arm , couple of ribs . Some internal bleeding . - Anybody else hurt ? - Yeah . I am . - What 's the matter ? - I 'm lonely . Stay out of my way . And out of my light . - I have work to do . - Don 't waste your time on him . - We 'll have to leave him behind . - We 're not leaving anybody behind ! We 'll see , Captain . We 'll see . It doesn 't look good . She 'll never fly again . Worse , she can 't sustain life . All her systems are purged . Looking on the brighter side , I think the snowram is operable . Let 's get her out so we can move the wounded into her . - He 'll be back . Get everybody out ! - I 'll get the snowram . Everybody , out ! Cylon patrol overhead . I might have expected you to trample me . - I didn 't see you in the dark . - You never did . - I 'll take Voight . Starbuck , help me ! - We 're gonna need the communicator . There 's no time . He 's spotted us . You have 10 microns before he 's back . Muffit . Shh . Boxey . Muffit wanted to see snow . Here he comes ! Get down ! Starbuck ! Get up on top ! Yeee-ha ! - Great shooting , Starbuck ! - Hey . Patrol leader was destroyed . Send out foot patrols . Hunt the survivors down . What are the coordinates of the Battlestar Galactica ? I 'm from the Columbia . The Columbia was destroyed at the peace conference . Peace conference ! You have a nervous system that carries impulses . Impulses from your brain that can be tapped . What is the exact position of the Galactica ? Go rust yourself . Connect his cortex to the brain probe . Begin the probe . Light the other snow lamp . Keep it shielded . Let 's go . - Come on , Wolfe . - You 're going across the mountain ? - We 'll make it . - It 's our chance to make a break . To where ? We 're stuck here . We can hunt , build shelter . We 've been in worse . We can hijack a Cylon transport , run to a sun system . No ! We signed on to blow up that pulsar cannon . You 'd crawl up that mountain to get your rank back . You used to have bite but now you 're toothless . You stay . We 're cutting loose the first chance we get . - Let 's go . We have a lot of loading to do . - All right ! - How are they ? - They 'll survive if we get shelter . Get them into the ram . We 'll rotate riding on top . - Haals and Wolfe go first ! - I 'll freeze to death ! You ride on top . That 's an order ! Let 's go ! - Get over ! - It 's frozen on that side ! - Do it before I push you ! - Take it easy , Wolfe ! Aah ! We 've just lost power . Leda ! Haals , are you OK ? - He 'll be all right . - What happened ? That clumsy warrior shorted out the power cells . - I 'll bet he did . - Stop it ! We got enough trouble . Ah ! We 've got to go on breathers . There 's a di-ethene wave building in this storm . - Are you all right ? - Just a little cold . - What are our chances ? - Depends on how long this storm lasts . - If the di-ethene reaches death point ... - What 's death point ? The air turns to liquid . Muffit ! Come back ! He 'll be all right . Muffit isn 't like us , he can survive di-ethene . - Will he be back ? - He 'll be back . I just hope he doesn 't bring a Cylon patrol back with him . Galactica . They are heading toward the plateau . The Galactica will be moving forward soon . Muffit will find help . At least this storm will cover his tracks . What do you think ... they 're doing to Cree about now ? We 've got 220 ships up there . You 're worried about one pilot ? It 's not just one pilot , it 's a pilot I was responsible for . It 's not your fault , Starbuck . Tell that to Cree . - Oh . - Where are we ? - What is this place ? - I 've never seen anything like it . Muffit , you came back ! Boxey ? - You OK , Dad ? - Yeah , I 'm OK . You are lucky your daggit found our hunting party . You were on Deathpoint Plateau . Nothing survives there . We 're very grateful . - Who are you ? - Simple hunters . Then you 'll return our packs and weapons and we 're free to go ? Go ? Where would you go ? The storm continues . The di-ethene has left you dehydrated . I will see that you receive liquids . Then we will talk of your going . I don 't like the way he said that . How 'd he get over there ? - Water , could we have some water ? - Silence . - The wounded need it . You said ... - I said silence ! - Here is the liquid and some food . - Didn 't we just talk to that guy ? They 're clones . We prefer the name Theta-class life forms . We found the wreckage . And the humans ? They escaped in a snowram . We found it abandoned on the plateau . You hunted them down ? No . Humanoids cannot survive the plateau . You came to destroy the Ravashol pulsar . - Ravashol ? - Dr Ravashol . He is human . A human created that thing for the Cylons ? - If it weren 't for him , we wouldn 't exist . - He is the Father Creator . Is Ravashol God ? I 'd like to meet him . No , he 's not God . Not if he 's with the Cylons . - Why does he work for the Cylons ? - They let him live to create . To create a weapon that destroys other humans . The mountain is filled with Cylons . Even if you could get by them , the pulsar is constructed of magna , practically indestructible . - We have solenite . - Solenite ? Your injured will stay here . They will be tended to . We will guide the rest of you to the village . - And then ? - You will see when you get there . - When are we going to make the break ? - Wolfe , don 't push it . - I just want you to know that I 'm ready . - Where 'd you get that ? It doesn 't matter where I got it . I can use it on the Cylons or anyone else who gets in our way . - Are you OK ? - Yes . Listen . - Have you seen any others like us ? - You mean , humans ? Yes , warriors . Uniformed , you know ? No , you 're the first we 've encountered . Where would the Cylons take a warrior prisoner ? I thought you were concerned about the gun ? Yeah , I am . Just curious . This is the edge of the ice field . We will follow the ravines from here . You are now close to the village . The entrance hatch is at the end of this ravine . Wait here . Tenna , come . You think they 'll turn us in to the Cylons ? No . I don 't know why but no . Warn the others . Starbuck , shh ! Cylon patrol . Pass the word . - Cylon patrol . - Everybody down . Shh . By your command . We have news from our outpost on Arcta . They have encountered fighter craft from the Galactica . Yes . But how did you know ? Why do you suppose I have been gently herding them to this quadrant ? Put out a call for additional base ships . Resume pursuit at flank speed . We have lost many fighter craft in our recent encounters . We do not have enough to overwhelm the Galactica . Adama does not know that . In any case he cannot retreat in our direction with additional base ships coming up . You are correct , of course . Yes . - You have your orders . - By your command . Soon , Adama . Soon .

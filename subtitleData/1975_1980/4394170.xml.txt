 ( Ruth , panicking ) ' What 's happening ? What 's happening ? 'What 's happening ? What 's happening ? ( Screaming ) ' No ! No ! 'No ! ' ( Continues screaming ) ( Screaming in agony ) 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' - What 's he done ? - He 's burned them alive . No , don 't ! Take time back . Save them . Take time back now . It 's too late . It 's too late to save them . That 's the second time you 've failed . - He creates a kind of barrier . - He ? It . Williamson . What did he discover ? She just ... She just disappeared from there . From that thing . I watched it , I saw it happen , I heard her screaming . She asked if she was in danger , I heard her when ... when you made her talk ... made the picture talk . Is she in danger ? - Liz ... - ( Steel ) ' Don 't tell her . ' We are all in danger . Because of him ? - The man on the stair ? - Yes . That 's why you must leave . You must pack a case and leave now . The other picture , the big one with Ruth in it . Could I have it , please ? We haven 't finished with it yet . Oh . See ... she 's ... Well , I suppose she 's the best friend I 've ever had . You could say the only friend . I don 't really collect friends . - Anyway , I 'll pack a case . - Good . Oh , it 's not good ... but it comes easy to me . Story of my life knowing how to pack a case . I 'm almost an expert at it . I feel like this lot sometimes ... looking like they 've been somewhere , going somewhere . But when you think about it , they 're staying where they are , they 're going nowhere , right ? Anyway ... When you bring Ruth back from wherever she is , will you let me know ... somehow ? Yes . Thanks . " H Williamson Esquire . " Just exactly what did he discover ? ( Steel ) Tricks ! Tricks . Tricks , tricks with film , tricks with cameras . We 've been looking for proof . For evidence of some great photographic discovery . Mr Williamson , photographer , was no more than a clever conjuror . Light patterns , multiple images , mirrors . That was the extent of his talent . Excuse me . To someone like Ruth , it was talent enough . A few cheap tricks to impress the ladies . At least he bothered to impress them . He simply used photography , slides . Nothing spectacular . He combined them . He combined pictures of people with pictures of places , but more important , he combined pictures taken at different times . They never learn , do they ? About the dangers of mixing the old and the new ? No . ( Projector hums ) Excuse me . ( Steel ) Combining the old and the new ... that was his first trick . - And his last . - Oh , no . Go sit on the sofa . Come on . It 's so primitive I don 't know why he bothered . I suppose Ruth was curled up on a cushion ... so he felt he had to put on a parade for her . A kaleidoscope ! A toy invented in 1817 . There 's no way he could have known that he was manufacturing an instrument of such power . A mirrored prism . A photograph taken from the multiple image slide . Now , that ... goes in here ... like that . The field of vision is fairly small but it 's enough . Oh , goodness , you are clever . No wonder Ruth was impressed . The shorter the focal length of the lens , the more numerous the images . - Is there a film in that camera ? - No . - Take the picture out . - It 's safe ... Take the picture out . You can never be sure . It was an accident . He brought it here ... by accident . And he didn 't just bring it here , he invited it here , dragged it here . With this , a mirrored prism acting like a kind of funnel . - Like a syphon . - Yes . For something that 's been trapped for almost 200 years . ( Sapphire ) Between times . ( Ruth ) ' " As I was going up the stair I met a man who wasn 't there ' " He wasn 't there again today ' " I wish , I wish he 'd stay away " ' He dragged it in there and held it there for a while . But then he decided to take his apparatus apart . In here was a force ... that had adopted not just one human shape but many . Trapped and held by their own reflections . There are 17 mirrors in this house . Now we know where he 's hiding . We 've got him . - No . - What do you mean , " no " ? No . Containing him is not enough . Well , it 'll have to do for the time being . Until we think of a way of sending him back . Ruth and Williamson were killed by him , he imprisoned them in a photograph and burned them alive . That must never happen again . ( Children ) # See , saw , sacradown # Which is the way to London town ? # One foot up and the other foot down This is the way to London town # Who is it this time ? Who is it , please ? Two more people . People we 've been looking for for a very long time . Let me see . Now , where shall we put them ? There , just there . Let 's put them there . Can we play games now ? Can we play games with them ? Later . There 'll be time for games later . ( Sapphire ) ' Steel ? 'Steel ? ' ( Steel ) ' The ... The-the girl . 'L-Liz . 'The only one left to help us is ... is Liz . ' 'You sent her away , do you remember ? ' 'But ... you told her to leave . ' ( Sapphire sighs ) ' Yes . 'Can you see anything ? ' 'Not clearly , no . ' 'Can you move ? ' ( Steel struggling ) 'No . ' 'Neither can I. 'Do you remember what the voice of Ruth said to us ? ' 'N-No ... 'Yes ! ' 'Like being half-asleep , half-aware . 'Like ... like daydreaming . ' 'Like being ... inside a photograph . 'Part of a ... of an old photograph . ' 'Yes . ' 'I 'm also remembering something ... something else . ' 'Go on . ' 'Whatever it is that has put us here , 'it has access to any photograph , including this one . 'And it ... it can also move around inside a photograph . 'We witnessed that . 'So ... so why can 't we move ? - ' Can you take time back ? ' - ' That 's impossible now . ' 'The girl , then . 'It has to be the girl . Try it , she may still be here . ' 'Liz ? 'Elizabeth Owen . ( Distant ) ' Liz . 'Steel , I think she 's still there . 'Liz ? Please , Liz . 'Liz , try to hear me . ( Distant ) 'Try to hear me with your mind . 'Please , Liz . 'Oh , she 's going ! ' - ' What ? ' - ' She 's going away . Liz ! ' I was ... Well , I 'm leaving . I know it 's short notice - no notice - but I 've found somewhere better , closer to work . - I see . - Anyway , me rent 's paid up . Well paid in advance so you keep what 's left . - Oh , thank you . - Keys and rent book are in my room . Fine . Now , er ... Would you mind ? Oh ! Thanks . ( Sapphire , very faint ) ' Liz ... 'I think she 's gone , Steel . ' 'There 's something else . We can try something else . 'We can ... We can make a mirror . 'Make a mirror f-from this glass . ' - ' But how ? ' - ' Lf we concentrate , both of us . - ' Think of Mercury , and Silver . ' - ' Yes . ' 'Think of what they can do , borrow from their minds . 'It can be done if we concentrate ... ' 'Steel ! ' ( Steel straining and struggling ) ( Hissing ) ( Door opens ) Who 's there ? I said who 's there ? - ( Sapphire ) ' He 's vanished . ' - ' Where ? Where 's he gone ? ' 'He 's ... He 's escaped into a photograph . ' 'Then he 's coming here , into this one ! He 's gonna destroy us . ' ( Sapphire ) ' Liz . 'Please , Liz . ' - ' She 's here ? ' - ' Yes . 'And so is he . He 's in here with us . ' ( Steel ) ' A prism . 'A mirrored prism . We must create one . ' - ( Sapphire ) ' Liz . ' - Yeah ? 'You must help us . ' Yes , but I don 't know what to do . - ( Steel ) ' Quickly . ' - ' No time for questions . - ' Just do as I say . ' - Yeah . 'There are some framed pictures in the corner , do you see them ? 'Bring them here now . Bring them to this photograph . 'Now ! 'Don 't look at them , Liz . 'Put the pictures by the mirror . 'One on each side . 'Leave your bag , leave it . 'You remember the mirror on your dressing table ? - ' Angle the pictures towards you . ' - Like that ? 'Yes , like that . More . More . 'Hurry , Liz . ' ( Screams ) - ( Howling ) - ( Liz ) What 's happened to him ? - He 's trapped . - Forever ? No , not yet . Tell me what happened to Ruth . She 's dead , Liz . No ... ( Howling ) Take it . ( Howling intensifies ) - We need something to keep him in . - Genie in a bottle . Let 's find a bottle . ( Voice ) 'Each and every photo is mine . 'They all belong to me . 'Trees and towns and villages , all made of paper . 'And paper burns . 'You , girl , no one hides from me . 'In years to come , I 'll find a photograph . 'Your photograph . I 'll be back . ' ( Howling continues ) The kaleidoscope ! ( Voice ) ' Paper burns . 'Nothing lasts . Only me . ' - He says it can never be forever ! - It 'll be a kind of forever . No ! No , please ! Please ! No . No ! - ( Steel ) A kind of forever ? - Yes . - Well , that isn 't . - Can I see ? - That won 't hold him for long . - 75 years . In 12 minutes and nine seconds , a ship is due to sink . - Where ? - In the Arctic Ocean . It will remain in a pyramid of ice for three quarters of a century . This must be on board when the ship goes down . And in 75 years ' time ? - We will be waiting . - There will be other shipwrecks . Find every photograph of you that there is - burn them . Never have another taken . ( Screaming )

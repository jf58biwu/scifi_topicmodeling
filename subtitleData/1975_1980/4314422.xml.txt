 'Moonbase Alpha status report , 892 days after leaving Earth 's orbit . 'Dr Helena Russell recording . 'We 've just passed through a space storm - duration 42 days . 'Our sensors have picked up a medium-sized planet . 'Commander Koenig is exploring it . 'The surface is rich in vegetation . 'It is our hope that it might prove habitable . ' Maya ? - Sensor reading ? - Surface temperature , 73 . Atmosphere breathable . - Let 's put it down . - OK . - Oxygen leak , life support system . - Take over . Right . Four hours until critical level . Do we abort ? No . Go back for another Eagle . Maya and I will complete the survey . Check . Moonbase Alpha to Commander Koenig . Go ahead . Eagle 1 has developed a malfunction and is returning to Alpha . Maya and I will continue our survey until Tony returns and picks us up . - ' Anything we can do , Commander ? ' - Just stay in touch . 'We 'll contact you every 30 minutes to check on you . ' Talk to you then . Out . - They 're edible . - Great . ( Screeching ) ( Angry male voice ) 'Cannibals ! Murderers ! 'You will be punished as cannibals and murderers 'deserve to be punished . ' Koenig to Alpha . Come in , Alpha . Koenig to Moonbase Alpha . Come in . 'Murderer . You have had your last communication with Alpha . ' - Who are you ? - ' We are the Judges of Luton . ' - What is the crime ... - ' Destroying life on this planet . ' We picked a flower and ate some berries . 'That is your crime . You killed members of our society . ' - We didn 't realise ... - ' But we are merciful , 'even to criminals of such magnitude . ' Believe us . If we committed a crime , it was out of ignorance . 'You will be given a chance to prove your innocent intent . ' ( Thunderclap ) 'These are your adversaries - also criminals from space 'who violated our laws . 'They too claim innocence due to ignorance . 'Your innocence will be tested by combat . 'The survivors will be given their freedom . ' Move . We need a weapon . If we break a branch , they 'll condemn us without a chance . Yeah . We 'd better not get hungry . Come on . Come on . - These would make good arrowheads . - Arrowheads ? Yeah . American Indians used arrows and bows . Oh ... We could probably make a bow , but we need some string . I bet we could make a spear . Must we kill them ? Maya ... Yes , if we want to survive . Well , if we reveal ourselves , it 's a sign of good faith . It 's obvious we mean them no harm . You 've got a point . - We 'll make contact . - Yes . But first ... let 's make sure we 've got some security between them and us - like a canyon . They 're tracking us . Hmm . Stay on hard ground . Mhhh . He can tear a mountain apart with his bare hands . You 're right , Maya . I 'd rather have him as a friend than as an enemy . ( Koenig ) Hello ! ( Voice echoes ) We don 't want to fight with you . We want to be friends . But he doesn 't . We 're not your enemy . Moonbase Alpha to Commander Koenig . Moonbase Alpha to Commander Koenig . Moonbase Alpha to Commander Koenig . ( Tony ) 'Eagle 1 requesting clearance . ' Eagle 1 , you 're clear for touchdown . 'Thanks . Do you have another Eagle for me ? ' Ready for lift-off as soon as you clear the launch pad , Tony . 'Thanks , Helena . ' Moonbase Alpha to Commander Koenig . Moonbase Alpha to Commander Koenig . Get that planet on the screen . - Where is it ? - It should be there . It 's GOT to be . Check your scanners . Not registering . The sensors are giving no readings . - Eagle 4 ready for lift-off . - ' Abort , Eagle 4 . ' - What ? - ' Abort . ' I 'm going back to that planet . We don 't know where that planet is . They don 't like the water . Maybe they can 't swim . Stay here . Listen to me . Please , listen to me . We 've no reason to fight . Don 't let them make us kill each other . Listen to me . Even if they can 't understand us , they must know we want to talk . Maybe it 's their nature to kill , not talk . - The river buys us time . - Maybe they 're leaving . No . Just trying to figure out a way across . It 'll be a while before they catch up to us . We 've got to find some way to defend ourselves . - What is it ? - I haven 't seen any live animals . Those vines have a stranglehold on that one . Let 's just say it eliminated a natural enemy . Koenig to Alpha . Koenig to Moonbase Alpha . Come in , Alpha . 'Commander Koenig , you waste valuable time . 'Devote yourselves to saving your lives . ' Why must we kill to save our lives ? 'Because those are the rules of Luton . ' We will not submit to those rules . They are cruel and vicious . 'We pride ourselves on our justice and our fairness . 'As proof of our fairness , 'we have given your adversaries abilities to match yours . 'Otherwise the contest would be too one-sided . ' We will not fight . We will not submit to those rules . 'Kill ... or die . ' I thought they were against killing . Animals must be a lower form of life on this planet . It 's acceptable to kill each other . I wonder what abilities they gave them . Three against two aren 't heavy enough odds ? - A lion or tiger might even it out . - No , Maya . He 'd tear you apart no matter what form you took . Wait . Maybe we could use your abilities to give us an edge . Then we 'd always know where they are . Don 't stay in one place too long . ( Roar ) Maya , stop him . Stop him ! We must talk to him . Come back . We won 't hurt you . Your shoulder . Come on . Sit down . Come on . Now we know the abilities the Judges of Luton gave to two of them . One they gave phenomenal strength and the other they made a transport . One second the other side of the river , the next second this side . If he could transport , why didn 't he do it again to escape ? Perhaps they 're only permitted to use their abilities once . Yeah , could be . - Anyway , thanks . - Nothing to thank me for . Then I thank the bird 's eyesight and the lion 's terrible roar . - Ohh . - Oh , I 'm sorry , but I 've got to stop the bleeding . Don 't look so sad , it doesn 't hurt that much . Be careful when you move . OK , Mom . I won 't get it infected and I won 't get any dirt in it . What you need is some rest . Right ( ! ) And some peace and quiet . ( Koenig ) We won 't get much of that . We 'd better take that with us . Give it to me . - It 's too heavy for you . - Don 't argue . - ' This is Eagle 4 . ' - Go ahead , Tony . My sensors give no readings . - ' That was expected , wasn 't it ? ' - Yours ? Still negative . And I still think you 're crazy . When I approach the planet , or think I 'm in the right area , I 'll check in . - ' Be careful . ' - I might even manage visual contact ! 'You should have a co-pilot . ' I 'm not letting anyone else share this risk . 'Remember your margin of safety . ' I remember saying I 'd be right back for them . Maya , we 'd better get moving again . You 'd better rest ! We 've got to be near where the Eagle touched down for when it comes back . - You 're weak . You need nourishment . - Sure ( ! ) How about some pheasant under glass , asparagus hollandaise , topped off with chocolate mousse and coffee espresso . Some broth . Maybe chicken . Rabbit . - Beef . - Sure . All we need are ingredients . This planet doesn 't have such ingredients any more . Maybe they didn 't kill every animal . Not all animals eat plants . Have you seen any ? The only bird we saw was you . If you change form , don 't stay in one place long . We mustn 't give them a chance to get at you . We also need some more weapons . That lance won 't be enough . ( Growling ) - Company , huh ? - Yeah . Careful . Oh , you can 't go on . Who says I can 't ? - Any questions ? - Yeah ... Why did I get you into this ? Better check out the area . There 's a long line of animal skeletons all along the rim . Looks like they 're in formation . Battle formation . Could be that this is where the animals made their last stand . The animals wiped out the plant life to protect their rear . Can you imagine the battle that took place on the rim of this cliff ? And the animals lost . Yeah ... Better check out our friends below , huh ? Yeah . - I can 't see anything from here . - Take a closer look . Right . You were supposed to be resting . Yeah . I will , as soon as I finish this . I had a good view but I only saw one . - I wonder where the other one is . - On the valley floor somewhere . - What are you making ? - It 's a bolo . In ancient times on Earth , bush natives ... invented a very effective weapon . A bolo ? Can I help ? Get some more rocks about this size . No , a little bigger . And round . Are you all right ? Well , it only hurts when I laugh . - Hmm ? - It 's an old Earth joke . It 's not funny . - Well , it was on Earth . - 50 years ago . OK , then tell me some old Psychon jokes . I 'm sorry , Maya . I didn 't mean to bring up sad memories . The memories aren 't sad ... except at the end . Psychon was a happy place . That 's why we wouldn 't leave even when we knew we faced disaster . Your brother left . My brother , like Mentor my father , was on our High Scientific Council . He knew there was no hope when our planet began to boil . So my brother and a thousand others went off into uncharted space , preferring to take their chances than face sure death . Did they find another planet ? We never heard from him again . Or any of the others who built spaceships and left ... as Psychon 's temperature kept rising . If the break-up of the planet was inevitable ... why didn 't Mentor leave ? My father 's dream was to restore Psychon , to make it the beautiful planet it once was . Nobody shared his dream . They all left , preferring to take their chances in the unknown . But if every ... every scientist on Psychon knew what was coming , why did Mentor remain so stubborn ? He wasn 't only stubborn . He was in love . My mother 's tomb was on Psychon and he wouldn 't leave her . What about you ? Oh , he tried to make me go ... but I wouldn 't . I couldn 't let him stay alone . - He should have made you go . - You don 't understand . He really believed he could perform the miracle of restoring Psychon . And I got caught up in that dream . Mentor was a great scientist . And he was my father . I knew he could do ... anything . - I don 't see anything . - Yeah ... Must you keep at it ? Firepower , Maya . In a combat situation , there 's nothing as persuasive as firepower . What about you , Commander , did you have any brothers ? Sisters ? Mother ? Father ? You had nobody ? - I had a wife . - Had ? - Aren 't there any wars on Psychon ? - No . Unlike your planet , we were of one race , one religion , one government . Our planet was so rich in resources there was no separation of classes . In 1987 ... all the hatreds on Earth between races ... classes and religions ... all came to a head . The war was global and ... awful . It was finally the war to end all wars because the survivors realised that ... if there was another one , it would be the ... the end of humanity . You mean ... people killed people just because they were different from each other ? That 's disgusting . The one virtue of that war - if war can have a virtue - is that prejudice was wiped out . People realised if ... If they were going to survive , they would have to ... work together . Accept each other for what they were . So we began to create a brand new ... wonderful civilisation . But it was too late for my wife . She was a casualty of that war . What was she like ? She was like ... Helena . - A weapon ! - It 's just like ours . - He 's down there , then . - Careful . He knows we 're alerted . His weapon is there but I don 't see him . - He 's gotta be there . - I don 't see him anywhere . Wind 's probably in this direction . Good . Come on . Come on , let 's move back . If my hunch is right ... we 've just discovered the third ability given to them by the Judges . We may not be able to see him , but he 's up here somewhere . Maya , you can pick up a scent . Find him , Maya . ( Scream ) 'Eagle 4 to Alpha . ' - Eagle 4 to Alpha . - Go ahead , Tony . I 'm close to where the planet should be . Can you see it ? ( Tony ) ' No . ' But I do have you on the monitor . Do you have me on the screen ? - Yes . - ' How about the planet ? ' We 'll try again . Yasko . Tony , we can 't get a fix on that planet . And you can 't stay there forever . 'Yes , I can . Send an Eagle to refuel me . ' ( Muttering ) It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's all right . Shh . Hey ... . Oh ... Are you better now ? What did I do ? Pass out ? No . You fell asleep . As long as I was only delirious . I 'd hate to have recurring nightmares like that . All right . If it 'll make you happy - you were delirious . That bad , huh ? It has to be cleaned . I 've got to find some water . ( Distressed cawing ) ( Distant cawing ) ( Cawing continues ) ( Growling ) Judges of Luton ... free her and I will go down to him . - ' We will not interfere . ' - I will let him kill me . 'No . ' She can keep that form for only an hour . She will be crushed . Free her and he can kill me ! 'We cannot . ' You 're The Judges of Luton ! You can do anything ! 'It is against the rules of Luton . ' Wait . Please ... Please ... Wait . Wait . ( Triumphant jeering ) Eagle 4 to Command Centre , refuelling Eagle coming alongside . - ' It is carrying a relief pilot . ' - I don 't want a relief pilot . Don 't be stubborn , Tony . Let your relief take over . No way . One of us taking this risk is all Alpha can afford . ( Helena ) ' According to our computer , you 're very close 'to the position of that planet . ' 'According to my instruments , uncomfortably close . ' - Too close . - ' I 'm still hoping for a visual . ' Give yourself more room , Tony . Any miscalculation , you 'll crash . I 'm not in the mood for miscalculations . 'How long do you expect to stay ? ' Forever , if I have to . ( Laughing ) We 're ... We 're fools if we fight . I don 't want to kill you , but I must . You ... You understand me ? It pleases the Judges of Luton to let us communicate at the moment of combat . Let her out of the cage . - She 'll be crushed ! - It is regrettable , but necessary that you both die so that I may live . ( Agitated cawing ) ( Cawing ) Maya ... 'Kill ! 'Kill ! 'Kill and you will be freed ! ' No ! I will not kill ! 'Kill the criminal who committed murder on Luton . Kill ! ' No ! YOU are the criminals . You could have stopped us before we tore plants and destroyed flowers . 'You have defeated the enemy . You are free . ' ( Koenig ) You want to see things die ! You would like everything here to die to satisfy your lust for death ! ( Rustling and squeaking ) 'Hear me . Listen ! ' ( Rustling and squeaking continues ) 'Listen to me ! ' 'Go . Go ! 'You are free . ' ( Squeaking and rustling continues ) I 've checked and rechecked , Alpha . According to my computer , I 'm at the planet and yet nothing . OK , Alpha , I found the planet . John and Maya , see if you can get through . Moonbase Alpha to Commander Koenig , Moonbase Alpha to Commander Koenig . They 're letting Alpha make contact . Anything to get rid of us before we start an uprising . 'Moonbase Alpha to Commander Koenig . ' Moonbase Alpha , this is Maya . Go ahead . Eagle 4 can touch down if you give your position . No need . We have visual contact . - Where did that come from ? - Hydroponics . Tony gave them to me to cheer me up after our ordeal . A plant ? Well , no one can say Tony doesn 't have a sense of humour . I think Tony needs his sense of humour retooled . - I thought it was a nice gesture . - So did I. He could have given you his abominable beer ! - Do you want one , Helena ? - I 'd love one . Hold it . Do me a favour , while I 'm around , never pick a flower . Back to hydroponic .

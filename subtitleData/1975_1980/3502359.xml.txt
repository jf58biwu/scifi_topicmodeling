 [ Crew chattering ] [ Parker laughing ] BRETT : This is the worst shit I 've ever seen , man . PARKER : Have you got any biscuits over there ? RIPLEY : Here 's some cornbread . PARKER : Cornbread . Yeah . LAMBERT : I am cold . still with us , Brett ? BRETT : Right . KANE : I feel dead . PARKER : Anybody ever tell you you look dead , man ? Oh , yeah , right . I just forgot something , man . Before we dock ... I think we ought to discuss the bonus situation . BRETT : Right . PARKER : Brett and I think we deserve full shares . BRETT : Mr. Parker and I feel the bonus situation ... has never been on an equitable level . You 'II get what you contracted for , Iike everybody else . BRETT : But everybody else gets more than us . ASH : dallas , Mother wants to talk to you . [ Buzzer ] Yeah , I saw it . yellow light 's for my eyes only . OK , get dressed , huh ? Parker , Iet 's go . PARKER : Can I finish my coffee ? It 's the only thing good on this ship . [ Beeping ] DALLAS : Good morning , Mother . RIPLEY : Right ? KANE : OK . plug us in . ASH : Thank you . Where 's Earth ? You should know . RIPLEY : It 's not our system . KANE : Scan . I can 't believe this . KANE : Contact traffic control . RIPLEY : This is commercial towing vehicle Nostromo ... out of the SoIomons ... registration number 1-8-0-9er 2-4-6-0-9er ... calling Antarctica Traffic control . Do you read me ? Over . commercial towing vehicle Nostromo ... out of the SoIomons ... registration number 1-8-0-9er 2-4-6-0-9er . - Nothing . - Keep trying . RIPLEY : calling Antarctica Traffic control . Do you read me , Antarctica ? Over . I found it . Just short of Zeta II ReticuIi . We haven 't reached the outer rim yet . That 's hard to believe . RIPLEY : calling Antarctica ... LAMBERT : What the hell are we doing out here ? KANE : I don 't know . What the hell are you talking about ? That 's not our system . I know that . PARKER : You ever notice how they never come down here ? I mean , this is where the work is , right ? BRETT : The same damn reason we get a half share to their one . Our time is their time . That 's the way they see it . Same old shit , man . PARKER : I know why they don 't come down here . It 's because of you . You have no personality . PARKER : Wonder what they want now ? What 's going on down here ? You happen to be in my seat . Can I have it ? - Yes . - Thank you . ASH : Sorry . PARKER : What 's happening now , baby ? DALLAS : well , some of you may have figured out ... we 're not home yet . We 're only half way there . PARKER : What ? DALLAS : Mother 's interrupted the course of our journey . KANE : Why ? DALLAS : She 's programmed to , should certain conditions arise . - They have . - Like what ? DALLAS : Seems she has intercepted ... a transmission of unknown origin . She got us up to check it out . RIPLEY : A transmission ? Out here ? DALLAS : Yeah . What kind of a transmission ? DALLAS : acoustical beacon . It repeats at intervals of twelve seconds . - S.O.S. ? - I don 't know . RIPLEY : Human ? DALLAS : Unknown . PARKER : So what ? KANE : We 're obligated under Section B-two- - PARKER : I hate to bring this up ... butthis is a commercial ship , not a rescue ship . It 's not in my contract to do this kind of duty . You want to give me some money to do it , I 'II be happy to . - Parker . - The man 's right . PARKER : Let 's go over the bonus situation . ASH : Can I say something ? PARKER : Let 's talk about the bonuses . ASH : There is a clause which specifically states ... any systematized transmission ... indicating a possible intelligent origin ... must be investigated . PARKER : I don 't want to hear it . I want to go home and party . Parker , will you just listen to the man ? On penalty of total forfeiture of shares . No money . You got that ? PARKER : well , yeah . AII right , we 're going in . LAMBERT : Approaching orbital apogee . Mark . twelve , eleven ... ASH : equatorial orbit nailed . - Main stabilizers in . - Eight seconds on descent . KANE : Grids energized . fields focused . LAMBERT : Five , four ... [ Voices overlapping ] Put the D.O.R.s in-Iine . RIPLEY : How 's the status on the lifters ? DALLAS : Give me an A.C. pressure reading . ASH : Forty-eight seconds and counting . RIPLEY : SR-one stable . DALLAS : Prepare to disengage from platform . LAMBERT : Twenty seconds . Eighteen , seventeen ... sixteen , fifteen ... fourteen , thirteen ... twelve , eleven , ten ... seven , six ... five , four ... three , two , one , lock . DALLAS : Disengage . OK . Money 's safe . Let 's take her down . KANE : roll 92 degrees portyaw . RIPLEY : Prime the port . RIPLEY : Prime ventral . Prime dorsal . DALLAS : Down a degree . LAMBERT : Nine hundred meters and dropping . Thirty-nine thousand . RIPLEY : turbulence . Locked and floating . Drop us any time now . inertial damping 's going off . hold on , people , there 's gonna be a little bump . [ Screech ] What the hell was that ? BRETT : Pressure dropping in deck three . Must 've lost a shield . Let 's go with it . ASH : Dropping off now . still dropping . There we are . We 've got it . Take her down . Navigation lights on . ASH : We 've got five-three still out . No problem . Just down eleven percent . Grid status ... OK . LAMBERT : Fifteen meters and dropping . twelve , eleven , ten ... nine , eight ... seven , six ... five , four ... three , two , one . kill drive engines . [ Siren ] DALLAS : What the hell happened ? [ Siren slows ] DALLAS : Somebody give me a straight answer ! - Is the hull breached ? - We 've still got pressure . DALLAS : Hit the screens . [ Wind howling ] PARKER ON INTERCOM : Secondary Ioad-sharing unit is out . Three of the four cells are gone . RIPLEY : Is that it ? PARKER : hold on . We can 'tfix it out here anyway . We need to reroute a couple of these ducts . KANE : Dry-docktime . BRETT : Dry-dock . tell them we need to dry-dock . PARKER : We couldn 't fix it out here anyway . We gotto reroute all these ducts . In order to do that , we 've got to dry-dock . DALLAS : [ Sighs ] What else ? PARKER : Some fragments caked up ... and we 've gotto clean it all out and repressurize it . DALLAS : How long before we 're functional ? PARKER : What ? BRETT : Seventeen hours , tell him . PARKER : At least twenty-five hours . RIPLEY : Get started . I 'II be right down . PARKER : What 's she coming down here for ? BRETT : She 'd better stay the fuck out of my way . PARKER : I 'd Iike to see what she 'II do . DALLAS : Any response yet ? ASH : Nope . absolutely nothing ... except the same transmission every twelve seconds . AII the other channels are dead . DALLAS : Kick on the floods . KANE : We can 't go anywhere in this . DALLAS : Mm-hmm . ASH : Mother says the sun 's coming up in twenty minutes . DALLAS : How far are we from the source of transmission ? ASH : Northeast , just under two thousand meters . KANE : walking distance ? [ dallas chuckles ] DALLAS : Can you give me an atmospheric ? ASH : Yes . ASH : Oh . It 's almost primordial . There 's inert nitrogen ... high concentration of carbon dioxide crystals ... methane . I 'm working on the trace elements . DALLAS : Anything else ? ASH : Yes . There 's rock--Iava base . Deep cold , well below the line . DALLAS : Mm-hmm . KANE : I 'II volunteer to be in the first group to go out . DALLAS : Yeah , that figures . You , too , Lambert . LAMBERT : swell . DALLAS : Better break out the weapons . [ blows ] LAMBERT : I can 't see a goddamn thing . DALLAS : Ash , are you receiving ? ASH : Good contact on my board . DALLAS : clear andfree . Keep the line open . Let 's go . PARKER : Hey , ripley ! Hey , ripley , I want to ask you a question . If they find what they 're looking for , does that mean we get full shares ? Don 't worry , Parker . Yeah . You 'II get whatever 's coming to you . BRETT : Look , I 'm not going to do any more work ... till we get this straightened out . RIPLEY : Brett , you 're guaranteed by law to get a share . PARKER : What ? Why don 't you just fuck off ? PARKER : What ? BRETT : What did you say , Rip ? RIPLEY : If you have any trouble , I 'II be on the bridge . PARKER : Don 't worry about it , baby . Hey , ripley . Come back here ! BRETT : Ha ha ha ha ! PARKER : Son of a bitch . BRETT : What 's the matter ? LAMBERT : I can 't see a goddamn thing . KANE : Quit griping . LAMBERT : I Iike griping . DALLAS : Come on , knock it off . How 's it going ? ASH : AII right . RIPLEY : Have you tried putting that transmission ... through E.C.I.U. ? ASH : No . Mother hasn 't identified it yet . Do you mind if I give it a shot ? ASH : please do . DALLAS : Ash , can you see this ? ASH : Yes , I can . I 've never seen anything like it . DALLAS : It 's very bizarre . KANE : You said it . DALLAS : AII right . Moving on to second ... position . LAMBERT : What is it ? Let 's get out of here . KANE : We 've come this far . We must go on . We have to go on . will you say that again ? Shit . DALLAS : Ash , as you can see , it 's hard to describe . ASH : I 'm going back to the console . [ garbled voice ] DALLAS : [ Faint ] Seems to be solid ... to walk . You OK , Lambert ? [ garbled transmission from dallas ] dallas ? dallas ? Come on down here . Something different down here . I don 't know what it is , but ... See if we can get up that wall ... then get up that wall behind there . KANE : Amazing . DALLAS : An alien life form . Looks like it 's been dead a Iong time . FossiIized . Looks like it 's grown out of the chair . DALLAS : Oh . Bones are bent outward ... like he exploded from inside . LAMBERT : I wonderwhat happened to the rest of the crew ? Let 's get the hell out of here . KANE : dallas , Lambert ! Come on over here . Come on . - What have you got ? - See what you make of this . Ash , that transmission . Mother 's deciphered part of it . It doesn 't look like an S.O.S. ASH : What is it then ? It looks like a warning . I 'm going to go out after them . What 's the point ? I mean , by the time it takes to get there ... they 'II know if it 's a warning or not . Yes ? [ Sighs ] DALLAS : You OK down there ? Can you see anything ? KANE : I don 't know . A cave . A cave of some sort , but I ... I don 't know , but it 's like the goddamn tropics in here . What the hell is this ? KANE : The pit is completely enclosed ... and it 's full of Ieathery objects ... like eggs or something . [ Humming sound ] There 's a layer of mist just covering the eggs ... that reacts when broken . DALLAS : Kane ! You all right ? KANE : Yeah , I 'm OK . AII right . I 'm OK . I just slipped . It appears to be completely sealed . [ Hiss ] KANE : Wait a minute . There 's movement . It seems to have Iife- - organic life . DALLAS : You there , ripley ? I 'm right here . ASH : OK , ripley , I 'm at the inner lock hatch now . RIPLEY : Right . - OK , ripley . - Right here . DALLAS : We 're clean . Let us in . What happened to Kane ? DALLAS : Something has attached itself to him . We have to get him to the infirmary right away . What kind of thing ? I need a definition . DALLAS : An organism . Open the hatch . Wait a minute . It could infect the ship . You know the quarantine procedure- - twenty-four hours for decontamination . DALLAS : He could die in twenty-four hours . If we break quarantine , we could all die . LAMBERT : Open the goddamn hatch ! We have to get him inside ! RIPLEY : No , I can 't do that . If you were in my position , you 'd do the same . DALLAS : This is an order . Open that hatch . Do you hear me ? RIPLEY : Yes . DALLAS : RipIey , this is an order ! Do you hear me ? Yes , I read you . The answer is negative . ASH : Inner hatch opened . DALLAS : My God . DALLAS : What the hell is that ? RIPLEY : How is he ? DALLAS : How are we going to get that off him ? How are we going to get it off ? ASH : Just a minute . Let me get some instruments . RIPLEY : Oh , my God . ASH : AII right . If I go for an incision here ... to try and remove one of the digitals from his face . DALLAS : You 're gonna do what ? ASH : Finger . I 'm going to try and get his finger off . Get this on there . DALLAS : It 's tearing his scalp . ASH : I know ! DALLAS : It 's not coming off without tearing his face off . ASH : We 'II have to take a look at him inside . PARKER : How come they don 't freeze him ? How come you guys don 't freeze him ? ASH : AII right , you can take your mask off . What 's it got down his throat ? ASH : I would suggest it 's feeding him oxygen . DALLAS : ParaIyzes him , puts him in a coma ... then keeps him alive . Now , what the hell is that ? - We 've gotto get it off him . - Just a minute . Let 's not be too hasty . We don 't know anything about ... it . Now , we 're assuming it 's feeding him oxygen . If we remove it ... it could kill him . I 'm willing to take that chance . Let 's cut it off now . You 'II take responsibility ? I 'II take responsibility . Get him out of there . DALLAS : Where do you want to do this ? ASH : We 'II make an incision just below the knuckle there . - Right here . - Stand by . Good God ! DALLAS : That crap 's gonna eat through the hull . It 's going to eat through the goddamn hull ! Come on ! BRETT : What 's going on ? DALLAS : This way . DALLAS : Next deck . PARKER : There it is ! Don 't get under it ! Don 't get under it ! RIPLEY : Looks like it 's stopping . PARKER : Take a look at this , man . DALLAS : Brett , what do you got , a pen ? Give it to me , quick . Come on ! BRETT : Don 't get any on your arm . It stopped . Haven 't seen anything like that except molecular acid . BRETT : It must be using itfor blood . PARKER : It 's got a wonderful defense mechanism . You don 't dare kill it . RIPLEY : What about Kane ? DALLAS : Here 's your pen back . BRETT : What do we do now ? DALLAS : Leave Kane to Ash . You get back to work . BRETT : well , what- - BRETT : OK . Try it . I thought sure that was it . PARKER : Try it again . BRETT : I feel like I 've been in this place a month . We shouldn 't have landed here in the first place . BRETT : ShouIdn 't have landed on this damn ball . I know that . The sooner we patch this thing up and get outta here ... the sooner we can go home . This place gives me the creeps . RIPLEY : That 's amazing . What is it ? ASH : I 'd say it 's , um ... I don 't know yet . Do you want something ? RIPLEY : Yes , I , uh ... would Iike to have a little talk . How 's Kane ? ASH : He 's holding . No changes . RIPLEY : And , uh ... our guest ? ASH : Hmm . RIPLEY : Hmm ? ASH : well , as I said , I was still collating , actually ... but I have confirmed ... that he 's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides . He has a funny habit of shedding his cells ... and replacing them with polarized silicone ... which gives him a prolonged resistance ... to adverse environmental conditions . Is that enough ? RIPLEY : That 's plenty . What does it mean ? ASH : please don 't do that . Thank you . RIPLEY : I 'm sorry . ASH : well , it 's an interesting combination of elements ... making him a tough little son of a bitch . And you let him in . ASH : I was obeying a direct order , remember ? Ash , when dallas and Kane are off the ship ... I 'm senior officer . ASH : Oh , yes , I forgot . You also forgot the science division 's ... basic quarantine law . - No , that I didn 'tforget . - Oh , I see . You just broke it . Look , what would you have done with Kane ? His only chance of survival was to get him in here . RIPLEY : unfortunately , by breaking quarantine ... you risk everybody 's life . Maybe I should have left him outside . Maybe I 've jeopardized the rest of us ... but it was a risk I was willing to take . It 's a pretty big risk for a science officer . It 's not exactly out of the manual , is it ? I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you , you know . You do your job and let me do mine . [ Mozart 's " Eine kleine Nachtmusik " playing ] RIPLEY : Where 's dallas ? ASH : In the shuttle . [ Intercom buzzes ] dallas . ASH : I think you should have a look at Kane . Why ? ASH : Something 's happened . Serious ? ASH : Interesting . [ Music stops ] RipIey , meet me in the infirmary right away . RIPLEY : Where is it ? ASH : I don 't know . We have to try and find it . DALLAS : Let 's check it . RIPLEY : dallas , please be careful . RIPLEY : Aah ! DALLAS : Sorry . ASH : No , not in the corner ! Have one of these ... just in case . Kane ? dallas ? Aah ! DALLAS : You OK ? ASH : I didn 't see it . Was it in the overhead ? DALLAS : What ? It was up there somewhere . ASH : My God . DALLAS : Cover the damn thing , will you ? It 's alive ! ASH : That 's a reflex action . well , we 've got to have a look at this . ASH : Excuse me . Seems dead enough . RIPLEY : well , good . Let 's get rid of it . ASH : RipIey , for God 's sake , this is the first time ... that we 've encountered a species like this . It has to go back . Tests have to be made . RIPLEY : Ash , are you kidding ? This thing bled acid . Who knows what it 'II do when it 's dead ? ASH : I think it 's safe to assume it isn 't a zombie . dallas , it has to go back . DALLAS : I 'd soon as not burn it at the stake ... but you 're the science officer . It 's your decision , Ash . RIPLEY : dallas ! DALLAS : I won 't change my mind . The decision 's made . RIPLEY : I 'm not trying to change your mind , dallas . I just want you to listen . will you listen to- - DALLAS : Oh . RIPLEY : How can you leave that decision to him ? DALLAS : I just run the ship . Anything to do with the science division ... Ash has the final word . How does that happen ? DALLAS : It happens because that 's what the Company wants . Since when is that standard procedure ? DALLAS : Standard procedure is to do ... whatthe hell they tell you to do . Did you ever ship out with Ash before ? I went out five times with another science officer . They replaced him two days before we left Thedus with Ash . I don 't trust him . I don 't trust anybody . What 's happening with the repairs ? They 're pretty much finished now . DALLAS : Why the hell didn 't you tell me so ? Because there 's still some things left to do . Like what ? RIPLEY : We 're blind on " B " and " C " Decks . - The reserve power system is- - - That 's a bunch of horse shit . We can take off without that . RIPLEY : We can . You think that 's a good idea ? DALLAS : I just want to get the hell out of here . Dust in the intakes again . Number two is overheating . Spit on it for two minutes , would you , for Christ 's sake ? RIPLEY : We 're hot , and we 're getting hotter . Engine room , red clip status ? One kilometer on ascension . RIPLEY : Engage artificial gravity . LAMBERT : Engaged . I 'm altering the vector ... now . DALLAS : Inhibit CNG control . LAMBERT : Inhibit CNG control . - Struts retract . - Struts retracted . LAMBERT : Max stress to fifth overload . DALLAS : Ease it back . walk in the park ! We fix something , it stays fixed . Don 't we , Brett , baby ? BRETT : Right . PARKER : I think we should freeze him . If he 's got a disease , stop it where it is . He can getto a doctor when we get back home . BRETT : Right . RIPLEY : Whenever he says anything ... you say , " Right , " Brett . You know that ? BRETT : Right . RIPLEY : Parker , your staff follows you around ... and says , " Right , " just like a parrot . PARKER : Shape up . You some kind of parrot ? - Right . - Knock it off ! DALLAS : Kane 's going into quarantine . That 's it ! RIPLEY : Yes , and so will we . LAMBERT : How about something to lower your spirits ? DALLAS : thrill me , will you , please ? LAMBERT : well , according to my calculations ... based on time spent getting to and from the pIanet- - DALLAS : Just give me the shortversion . - How far to Earth ? - Ten months . - Oh , God . - Great . [ Intercom buzzes ] RIPLEY : Yes ? ASH : dallas , I think you should come and see Kane . DALLAS : Has his condition changed ? ASH : It 's simpler if you just come and see him . RIPLEY : We 're on ourway . BRETT : Right . [ Parker laughing ] LAMBERT : How are you doing ? [ Kane coughing ] PARKER : How you doing ? Oh , terrific . Next silly question . KANE : Oh , thankyou . DALLAS : You remember anything about the planet ? RIPLEY : What 's the Iast thing you do remember ? I remember some horrible dream about smothering , and ... Anyway , where are we ? - Right here . - On our way home . Back to the old freezerinos . I 've got to have something to eat before we go back . I need something myself . DALLAS : Yeah . One more meal before bedtime . I 'm buying . Hey , that 's a break . [ Chattering ] PARKER : What--what happened to this guy ? KANE : The first thing I 'm gonna do when I get back ... is to get some decent food . PARKER : I can dig it , man . I 've eaten worse food than this ... but then I 've tasted better , you know ? LAMBERT : You pound it down like there 's no tomorrow . PARKER : I 'd rather be eating something else ... but right now , I 'II stick to food . KANE : well , you should know . You know what it 's made of . PARKER : I don 't want to talk about what it 's made of . I 'm eating this . [ Kane coughing ] PARKER : What 's the matter ? The food ain 't that bad , baby . - Are you choking ? - What 's wrong ? DALLAS : What ? Kane , what 's the matter ? [ Kane screaming and gagging ] - Get the spoon in ! - hold him down ! ASH : Get the spoon in his mouth ! PARKER : Damn it ! - Get it in his mouth ! - I 'm trying ! KANE : Aaahh ! Aah ! LAMBERT : Aah ! KANE : Uhh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! [ Screaming ] Uhh ! Aah ! [ alien screeches ] LAMBERT : Oh , God ! ASH : Don 't touch it ! Don 't touch it ! [ Screeches ] BRETT : dallas ? - Yeah . - Anything ? DALLAS : No . You ? BRETT : Nothing . - Did you see anything ? - No . DALLAS : Inner hatch sealed . Anybody want to say anything ? BRETT : This is an ordinary prod , Iike a cattle prod . It 's got a portable battery . It 's insulated all the way up to here . Just make damn sure nobody touches the end of it . ShouIdn 't damage the little bastard ... unless its skin is thinner than ours ... but it will give him a little incentive . LAMBERT : Now we just have to find it . ASH : I 've taken care of that . I 've designed this tracking device . You set itto search for a moving object . Hasn 't got much of a range , but when you get close ... it gives off a signal . RIPLEY : What 's it key on ? ASH : Micro changes in air density . DALLAS : Give me a demo . [ whistling sound ] - You see ? - Again . [ whistling ] DALLAS : Gotcha . Two teams- - Ash , Lambert , and I. RipIey , you take Parker and Brett . Now , anyone see this thing ... catch it in a net that Parker 's holding . Parker , I don 't want any heroics out of you , all right ? Catch it , put it in the airlock , and get rid of it . channels are open on all decks . I want you to communicate at all times , all right ? Let 's go . RIPLEY : I thought you fixed twelve module . BRETT : We did . I don 't understand it . PARKER : The circuits must have burned out . BRETT : What have we got here ? PARKER : Damn it . hold your light over here , would you ? Yeah , that 's it . I don 't know if this will work . Maybe I can just put this in there . BRETT : Right . PARKER : Damn it . BRETT : Check the insulation . PARKER : Oh , shit . [ TrackerwhistIing ] RIPLEY : According to this , it 's within five meters . PARKER : Let 's open the door . RIPLEY : Micro changes in air density , my ass . It 's within five meters . PARKER : Be careful . PARKER : Don 't creep up on me with that thing . RIPLEY : You guys stick together . [ whistling modulates between soft and loud ] Don 't fall me now . BRETT : What ? What is it ? RIPLEY : Parker , Brett . It 's in this locker . Get the net . I got it . I got it . BRETT : Wait a minute . RIPLEY : AII right , Parker , when I say . AII right , now . BRETT : Easy . RIPLEY : Wait ! Don 't let him go ! PARKER : What the hell are you doing , man ? BRETT : It 's the cat , man . [ Parker laughs ] PARKER : Hey , look now . We had to bag it . Now we might pick it up on the tracker again . - I 'II--I 'II- - - Go and get it , man . RIPLEY : AII right , you get him . We 'II go on . Here , kitty . Here , kitty , kitty . Enough of that kitty crap . Jones ! Jonesy ? Here , Jonesy ! Meow , meow . [ Meow ] Jonesy ? Here , kitty , kitty , kitty . Meow . Here , Jonesy ! Jonesy . [ Meow ] Here , kitty , kitty . [ Cat screeches ] [ Water dripping ] [ Chains rattling ] Kitty , kitty , kitty . Here , Jonesy . Jonesy ! Kitty , kitty . [ clang ] Jonesy ? Hey , come on , Jonesy . Come on , baby . That 's a kitty . That 's a kitty . Come on , baby . That 's a kitty . [ Hisses ] Hey , hey , I 'm not going to hurtyou . Come on . [ growling ] Aaaaaaah ! Aaaaaaah ! Whatever it was , it was big and ... You sure it took him into the air shaft ? Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts . PARKER : It 's using the air ducts to move around . LAMBERT : could he want Brett alive ? RIPLEY : What ? LAMBERT : could Brett be alive ? RIPLEY : No . I mean , I don 't think so . DALLAS : This air shaft may work to our advantage . Here it leads up to and comes out ... in the main air lock . There 's only one big opening along the way . We 'II cover that up ... then we drive it into the air lock ... and zap it into outer space . The son of a bitch is huge ! It 's like a man . It 's big ! [ Muttering ] Kane 's son . RIPLEY : Ash , the science department should help us . What can we do to drive it ? It 's adapted remarkably well to our atmosphere ... considering its nutritional requirements . We don 't know about temperature . RIPLEY : What happens if we change it ? ASH : Let 's try it . Most animals retreat from fire . DALLAS : Fire , yeah . Parker , can you rig three or four incinerator units ? Give me about twenty minutes . I 'II do it . - Who gets to go into the vent ? - I do . DALLAS : No . You and Ash ... take the main air lock . Parker , Lambert ... you cover up that maintenance opening , please . LAMBERT : Right . DALLAS : I 'm at the first junction . RIPLEY : dallas , I 'm right here . - Parker ? - Yeah . DALLAS : Lambert ? LAMBERT : I 'm trying to get a reading . RIPLEY : The air lock is open . DALLAS : OK , ripley . RIPLEY : Ready . DALLAS : Moving up . LAMBERT : AII right . I 've got a reading on you now . [ Machine beeping ] DALLAS : Uh , open the hatch to the third junction . OK , I 'm through . RipIey ? Yes . DALLAS : close all the hatches behind me . I 'm moving on . LAMBERT : dallas , hold it a minute . I think I got it . - Yes , I 've got it . - Where ? LAMBERT : Somewhere around the third junction . DALLAS : OK , moving on . LAMBERT : It is right around there . Be careful . DALLAS : AII right . I 've reached ... the third junction , and I 'm going down . PARKER : What the hell 's the matter with that box ? [ Beeping ] LAMBERT : dallas , hold your position for a minute . I 've lost the signal . DALLAS : What ? You sure ? LAMBERT : Are you sure that it 's not there ? It 's got to be around there somewhere . DALLAS : Check that out , Lambert . You may be getting interference . LAMBERT : Are you sure there 's no sign of it ? It is there . It 's got to be around there . dallas ? [ Muttering ] I can 't believe this is happening . AII right . Uh , am I clear ? I want to get out of here . LAMBERT : Oh , God , it 's moving right towards you ! DALLAS : Uh ... LAMBERT : Move ! Get out of there ! It 's moving towards you ! Move ! dallas ! Move , dallas ! Move , dallas ! Get out ! No , not that way ! The other way , dallas ! [ Screeches ] dallas ? - No ! - Take it easy . PARKER : dallas ? [ Static ] We found this laying there . No blood ... no dallas ... nothing . How come nobody 's saying nothing ? RIPLEY : I 'm thinking . unless somebody has got a better idea ... we 'II proceed with dallas ' plan . What ? And end up like the others ? Oh , no , you 're out of your mind ! - You got a better idea ? - Yes . LAMBERT : I say that we abandon this ship . We get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here ! We take our chances and just hope that somebody- - Lambert , shh . The shuttle won 't take four . LAMBERT : Then why don 'twe draw straws ? I 'm not drawing any straws . I 'm for killing that thing right now . RIPLEY : OK . well , Iet 's talk about killing it . We know it 's using the air shafts . Listen to me , Parker ! Shut up ! PARKER : Let 's hear it . Let 's hear it . RIPLEY : It 's using the air shafts . - We don 't know that . - That 's the only way ! We 'II move in pairs . We 'II go step by step and cut off every bulkhead ... and every vent until we have it cornered ... and then we 'II blow it the fuck out into space . Is that acceptable to you ? PARKER : If it means killing it . obviously , it means killing it ... but we have to stick together . How are our weapons ? The weapons are fine . This one needs refueling . RIPLEY : will you get it , please ? Ash , go with him . PARKER : No , I can manage , Ash . Don 't follow me . Ash ? Any suggestions from you or Mother ? ASH : No . We 're still collating . You 're what ? You 're still collating ? I find that hard to believe . ASH : What would you Iike me to do ? RIPLEY : Just what you 've been doing , Ash- - nothing .

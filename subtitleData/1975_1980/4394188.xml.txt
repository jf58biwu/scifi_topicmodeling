 - When will you be back ? - Tomorrow . - At what time ? - ' Steel ! ' - To continue my investigation ... - Keep quiet . - Pardon ? - ' What is it ? ' 'It 's the platform again . Something ... changing . 'Something happening . ' 'The flowers have appeared again and the smell of summer 'but there 's something else , Steel , something else this time . ' 'Can you identify it ? ' 'Just ... a very powerful feeling ... of hatred . 'And resentment , a strong feeling of resentment . 'The whole atmosphere out here is charged with it . 'And that sound , Steel . ' 'Can you hear that ? ' 'No . What is it ? ' 'It 's the sound of a band . It 's approaching . ' 'It 's coming here . ' Listen . 'And I can hear men ... marching . ' Do you hear that ? - ' Be careful , Sapphire . ' - You hear it ? - ' Sapphire , be careful . ' - ' I 'm all right , Steel . ' - # What 's the use of worrying ... # - ' Sapphire , leave that platform now . 'We 're in the waiting room . Come here now . ' 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' 'Sapphire , leave that platform . 'Answer me . ' It 's hot . It 's a hot summer day . # Smile , boys that 's the style ... # He likes the sun . He says it makes things grow , makes the corn ripe . - # It never was worthwhile ... # - I can hear wood pigeons and bees . # Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag ... # It 's very hot and very , very still . He 's with them , you see . It 's their special sendoff . # Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag # And smile , smile , smile - # While you 've a lucifer ... # - Do you hear it ? Do you hear that ? 'Who are you , Sapphire ? 'Who are you ? ' # What 's the use of worrying ? - # It never was worthwhile ... # - No passenger trains today . This station is closed to ordinary passengers . # ... and smile , smile , smile # Wait a minute , the doors are locked . There are just the girls . Just the girls who gave ... who gave them ... Look ! Look , it 's daylight out there ! It won 't open . The girls who gave us flowers . Steel ! Wait ! It 's amazing . Really amazing . - Tell me . - He ... - It is without life . - An external projection ? - No , an after-image . - After-image ? Yes , it lived once . To think we 're witnessing ... It 's amazing . Would you please be quiet ? Who were you ? Surely you can see he was a soldier ? Who were you ? Who am I , more like . No . Sorry but you 're dead . - Who were you ? - Give the poor lad a chance . Please . Let him do it his way . You might as well tell me . I reckon you might as well find out for yourself . All right . What do you want here ? I reckon you might as well find that out and all . You see what you 've done ? You 've driven him away . So that 's your threat , is it ? That poor lad . I mean ... I mean is that really your idea of evil ? Yes , it is . Well , it isn 't mine ! Please come back . In the name of God , please come back . " I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me " Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth . " Yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labours ... " The after-image belonged to someone who died during The Great War . - Great War ? - 1914 to 1918 . Died here ? This was a battleground ? No , the sendoff was from here . Did you hear the train ? - Yes . - And the women ? - Women ? - Yes . They cheered them on their way and made them think that they were heroes . - No , I didn 't hear them . - I did . It was something he wanted me to experience , to participate in . Just momentarily . Not to frighten me , he just wanted me to experience it . Why ? Because those women were part of this place for him . He resented what they stood for . - You sensed that ? - Yes . Was it the same feeling of resentment and hatred you felt on the platform ? Some of it , yes , but not all of it . So this is where it all started for him . His death started here . Great wars , civil wars , holy wars ... Sometimes I wonder why they bother to send us here . It 's not enough . That amount of resentment , it 's not enough . He was a soldier , he went to war . He knew of the possibility of being killed prematurely . No , it 's not enough . You 're sure that was the war he was killed in ? Oh , yes . I saw his death . It was something else he wanted me to experience . - Where 's Tully ? - Waiting . - Where ? - In the waiting room . I 'm gonna send him home . Then we have to find out who he was , his name , where he lived , and exactly where and when he died and what his intentions are . - He didn 't come back . - No ? And I 'm hoping that he hasn 't deserted us for good . - I doubt that he has . - Cos that would be a pity . - That lad 's ghost has things to say . - I 'm sure he has . - Things to tell us . - Mr Tully . - I 've decided to stay on tonight . - Have you ? A sort of emergency service . So no more jokes . I 'd rather you didn 't make fun of me . I 'm not stupid . - I happen to realise . - Realise what ? That the pair of you are working along similar lines to me . - All right , alternative lines . - I 'd prefer that . I 'm aware of your ... well , your tour de force . - Our what ? - The way you 're able to communicate . Some method of thought transference is it ? - Something like that . - Very clever . And you seem clairvoyant . Must have taken years of practice ... - Mr Tully . - Yes ? Do you have any more tapes for this machine ? I have some , yes . - Recordings you 've made here ? - Yes . But I 'm not giving them to you . - You said my equipment was junk . - It is . Give them to me . Oh , no , no . This is part of a record of my research . I 've answered your questions but you haven 't answered one of mine . So , as fellow investigators , a part of my research information in exchange for a part of yours . Tell him . This much . This force , what does it look like ? We don 't know yet . - Yet you say it 's dangerous , evil . - Yes . Then it can hardly be the ghost of that poor soldier . - The man who killed him , perhaps . - No , this force is not human . - But ... - It draws its power from emotional responses of the human kind . - You mean the human soul ? - No , I do not mean the human soul . - I mean responses . - Like what ? Like hatred , anger , resentment . You 're trying to tell me that this force thrives on some of the worst human feelings ? - Yes . - Of living people ? No . Preferably the dead . - Where does this force come from ? - We don 't know . - You seem to know enough . - Yes . How can this force use the persona of the dead ? - The persona lives on . - Where ? In the atmosphere . It only has to be activated . - No more questions . - What ? - The exchange is over . - It is not . I gave your friend four tapes . All I 've had is hints about how dead people ... - Mr Tully . - Just the man I wanted to see ... - The first tape . - Yes ? - Had it ever been used before ? - No . It 's a blank tape . A new one . Did you check it before you used it ? - I always do . - And ? Well , I just said - it was blank . The only recording made on this tape was this evening ? - Yes . - Have you played it ? - I haven 't had much chance . - What is it ? Listen . 'In the name of God ... please tell me who you are . 'I know you 're here . 'I 'm a friend ... and I want to help you . ' - There 's nothing wrong with that . - Listen . 'So will you let me help you ? 'Please ? 'You can trust in me . ' A pigeon . - That 's you moving the machine ? - Yes . - You don 't switch it off to move it ? - No . 'What are they doing ? ' 'Radio ... radio messages . 'Making ... Making a distress call . ' 'Jamie 's passed out . ' 'The air ... Not enough air . ' 'Then don 't waste it talking . ' 'How ... how deep are we ? 'At the bottom ? 'Hey ... No pumps working and we 're at the bottom . 'Hey ? 'The tank 's full ... and we 're at the bottom . - ' Right at the bottom . ' - ' Don 't ... don 't talk . 'Save ... Save the air . ' ' ... during an important psychical investigation 'and that can be dangerous . ' - And that was picked up ? - On the footbridge stairs . - But I heard nothing . - No ? - Have you heard anything like it ? - No . - Nothing like that ? - No . Only the sounds of the soldier . It sounded like death again - someone 's death . - Yes . - But where were they ? In a submarine . - And yet ... - What ? Well ... our young soldier was obviously from the First World War and that seems sort of later . Why later ? I don 't think they had electric pumps in the First World War . I couldn 't swear to that but ... I was at the top , on the footbridge , Tully was at the foot ... Working my way up . Working his way up . Try the stairs . - Nothing . - What about the top ? Yes . There 's something ... somewhere . It 's not very strong but it 's somewhere here . - What are you sensing ? Resentment ? - No . - Hatred ? - Neither of those , it 's more like ... fear and hopelessness . - What 's the temperature ? - Cold . I 've never recorded a temperature drop there . Always the opposite . Yes , it 's quite cold . Give me details . It 's just cold . It 's a strange sort of cold , like ... Like at the bottom of the sea ? No , the other extreme . What ? It 's like high in the air . The air 's thin , it 's a high altitude . - But it 's still dark ? - No , the sun is shining ! It 's very bright . It 's almost dazzling ! It 's gone . - Whatever it was , it 's gone . - Maybe it 's designed to confuse us . It 's all a bit of mixture , isn 't it ? Bottom of the sea , high in the air . Things out of order , out of time . And the voices ? It has to be the soldier . The main instrument is the soldier - only him . - Yes . - We 've seen him . We know this place is important to him . That his resentment started here . Is that what you 're thinking or what you 're hoping ? Hoping . I 'd rather not have to think the obvious . That this could be a recruiting ground for the dead ? Yes . I 'm gonna check the other three tapes .

 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' What 's wrong ? Will you please tell me what 's wrong ? Will you please tell me what 's wrong ? It 's Steel . - Look ! - Ignore them . I said ignore them , Mr Tully . Stay with me . Yes , but the flowers are ... We must ignore that , too , for now . Steel ? It seems to be everywhere . Yes , I know . Steel . All I want is a chance to try and talk to him . The soldier ... You will get your chance but not just now . 'Steel ? 'Tell me , Steel , try to tell me what 's happened . ' What are you doing ? There 's nothing there . - Listen . - I heard that . - Like being in a room underground . - Or under the sea . Yes . Under the sea . We 're back to normal . I 'll go in there first , please . You just keep behind me , right ? Is he asleep ? Or what ? Is he ill ? - Mr Tully ? - Yes , can I help ? Would you check the other rooms on this floor ? Make sure there 's nothing strange in them . Leave it to me . - If you get worried ... - I 'll shout . Fine . 'Steel . ' Take it back , Sapphire . Take time back . - But hurry . - Yes , Steel . - It 's all right out there . - Stay there . He 's unconscious . - Well , let me ... - I know what to do . Just stay there . - All right . - ' Quickly . Take time back . ' - ' With Tully here ? ' - ' You 'll have to . 'You must get me back . Quickly . ' 'Take my hand , then . 'Keep me here . ' I 'll go in there first , please . You just keep behind me , right ? Quickly ... quickly . Quickly , or I 'm as dead as he is . Please tell me what 's wrong . I 'll go in there first , please . You just keep behind me , right ? Yes ? - We 've been looking for you . - Why ? Because , er ... Yes , why ? Wasn 't I supposed to be checking the rooms on this floor ? Yes . Making sure there 's nothing strange . - That 's right . - Yes , leave it to me . - Remember ? - I 'm not sure . Remember now ? Yes . It was a death . Someone 's death . Yes , it was your turn to experience it . Who was sitting there ? The soldier ? No , it was someone else . Another arrival . A new recruit . What did he look like ? He was young . He was wearing flying clothes . - What time period ? - They 're Second World War . - There were no connections to here . - None at all ? Not during his life . None that I could sense . And how close did I come to joining him in his last flight ? Almost as near as the real thing . Yes ? Well , I 've had enough of ghosts waging war on us . It 's time we fought back . - It 's all all right out there . - Lights . Hmm ? - Lights are for the living . - What ? - Darkness is for the dead , right ? - Well , er ... It 's time we got some of these working . - You 'll be lucky . - I should think so , yes . - The lights haven 't worked in years . - So ? So how do you expect to get them to work ? - Light it ? - Yes . How on earth do you expect me to light that ? With a match . Come on , up you get . Will you get up and light it ? - But they 're obsolete . - You should know about obsolescence . - I beg your pardon ? - Just light it . What about all the other lamps ? - They 're waiting to be lit . - " They 're waiting to be lit " ! Beautiful . One , two , three , four , five . One , two , three , four , five . - One , two , three , four , five ... - It 's not happening now . - When it was did you sense anything ? - Not really . - No responses ? - It didn 't last for very long . Did you sense anything that was once human ? There wasn 't enough time . One , two , three , four ... So there was only a change in the quality of the sound ? Yes . You think it came from a submarine ? From a compartment in that submarine , yes . 'I want to help you . ' That ? Not as much , not nearly as much . What about that ? No , I didn 't hear that . You didn 't hear that or the electric generator . No . 'The air ... not enough air . ' There are three of them and one 's unconscious . How deep ? - Young voices . - ' The bottom ? ' Voices of young sailors . 'No pumps working and we 're at the bottom . ' I think ... I think that what Tully and I experienced was later than that - when the electrical supply to the submarine had failed . The men were already dead ? Well , there was no air left for them to breathe . They were all young - the soldier , the pilot , the men in the submarine . But young men die in war , it 's accepted , so they can 't be using that . - Maybe they ... - But they 're still here . It 's supplying them with power . It 's letting them use after-images of their own deaths to fight us . Therefore , each one has his own death , his own resentment . - Maybe they 're working as a group . - Collective grievances ? The soldier acting as head man . - A spokesman ? - Yes . Yeah , maybe . A spokesman usually wants to negotiate ... and he hasn 't asked for anything from us . Not yet . Just before I took that crash-dive , he was keeping things cheerful by whistling that tune of his . - There was something on the window . - 11 . Yes . " The Great War ended with suspension of hostilities " on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month . " - There were four elevens . - I know . So , do ghosts make mistakes with their arithmetic or has this ghost made another kind of mistake ? Wouldn 't you say he feels sorry for himself ? Why ? Showing you the women that sent him to war , haunting the place that gave him the sendoff . The date of a ceasefire he never saw . He 's a ghost with feelings . It 's almost as if he 's asking for sympathy . I think whatever it is made a bad choice in him . Don 't be too sure . A ghost with feelings . - I 'm gonna bring those feelings out . - What ? Stay there . Watch from the window , watch the platform . I 'm gonna bring him out . I 'm gonna make things really irritating for him . After all he 's been through , he needs cheering up . Right ? Wrong . Just watch the platform . Let me know when you see him . What do you mean " sing " ? I want you to sing . I want to cheer this place up a bit . Would you mind telling me why ? - The soldier ... - Yes ? - We 're going to bring him to us . - How ? By singing his song for him , that 's how . But we 're not going to do it the way he does it . We 're gonna liven things up . Do you know the words ? - Words ? - To the tune he whistles . - Yes . - Sing them . Come on , Mr Tully , let 's hear them . - # Pack up your tro ... # - That 's fine . - Mr Tully . - Yes ? I can 't do it without you . Please ? Let 's make them sound happy . Come on . # Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag ... # - Great ! Louder . - # ... and smile , smile , smile # While you 've a lucifer to light your fag # Smile boys , that 's the style # What 's the use of worrying ? # It never was worthwhile # So pack up your troubles in your old kitbag # And smile , smile , smile # Again .

Well , let 's waken the dead ! # Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag # And smile , smile , smile # While you 've a lucifer to light your fag # Smile boys , that 's the style # What 's the use of worrying ? # It never was worthwhile # So pack up your troubles in your old kitbag # And smile , smile , smile # Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag # And smile , smile , smile # While you 've a lucifer to light your fag # Smile boys , that 's the style # What 's the use of worrying ? # It never was worthwhile # So pack up your troubles in your old kitbag # And smile , smile , smile # Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag # And smile ... # ... you 've a lucifer to light your fag # Smile boys , that 's the sty ... # # ... and smile , smile , smile # ... and smile , smile , smile # While you 've a lucifer to light your fag # Smile boys , that 's the sty ... # # Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag # And smile , smile , smile - # Pack up ... # - That 's enough . - No more . No . - Come on ! I 'm sorry . I didn 't want to do it . Really I didn 't . I 'm sorry . Please bring back the flowers again , will you ? Let 's see the flowers again , please . - A flare . - What ? It 's Tully . Tully ! Mr Tully ? Excuse me , sir . 'Sapphire ? ' Tully ? Mr Tully ?

 Aha , found you ! Anyone else in there with you ? Don 't be silly . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' Annabelle ? - Annabelle ? - Howard ! - What on earth are you doing ? - What the devil 's going on ? ! - Oh , my God ! - Veronica , you 're spoiling it all . We weren 't gong to play Murders till after dinner . She 's not playing , is she , Arthur ? No . No , she 's not playing . The girl 's dead . 'Did it kill Veronica or did someone in this house do it ? ' 'It could be one and the same . ' Who would have done such a thing ? Almost anyone . Almost anyone in this house , Emma . Poor , poor , lovely girl . Felix , ring for the police , will you ? Greville , get something to cover the body . That storm 's come out of nowhere . - Somebody 's missing . - I don 't think so . Tony Purnell , someone should tell him . Maybe he already knows . Everyone has to remember where they were and what they were doing . - When ? - Within the last ... - Ten minutes ? - Yes . Within the last ... ten minutes . I can 't even remember yesterday - I can 't even remember coming here . - But ... - Get on with it . - The knife , sir . - What about it ? It 's one of our carving knives . I laid it in the dining room earlier . That would make it accessible to anyone . - Cover the poor girl . - Then there were nine . - What 's she babbling about ? - Arthur , there were ten of us here . - I didn 't really check ... - You . Me ... Emma and ... - ' What 's my name ? ' - ' Miles . ' - Miles . - Thank you . Howard . Virginia . Annabelle ... and ... - Felix . - Yes ? - Veronica Blamey . - That 's nine . And Tony Purnell makes ten . Wherever he is . - Did you get the police ? - No , I couldn 't . - Why not ? - The telephone 's dead . - Dead ? - That 's significant . - Why is it ? - A dead telephone ? Because it means this house is cut off . All part of the device . This is not a damn story , this is real . Is it ? We 're not cut off , the storm has affected the telephone . Felix ! Be a good chap , get in your car and nip down to the village . Annabelle and I motored down with the McDees . I would go with pleasure but I didn 't bring a car ! - Greville will take you . - Mr Harborough ? Sir ? The rest of us had better look for Purnell . I 'm going upstairs . - The door 's locked ! - Impossible , sir . That fog ... it 's icy cold . - It won 't open , sir ! - Don 't be so stupid , Greville ! You 're right , it won 't . The window . Howard , smash the window . 'It has completely isolated this house . ' 'There 's no way out ? ' 'No conventional way out , no . ' 'Which one of them , Sapphire ? 'Which one of them killed her ? ' 'Which one of them does it control ? ' 'Maybe it 's one and the same . ' Hello ? Hello , operator ? Hello ? ! Oh , it 's you . Look , the phone 's dead and ... It is a time change , most likely . And there is a logical reason for using this house . It says here that it 's on a ley line . It runs across this part of the country and through this building . Mm , it 's a perfect place for turning the clock back . And the summer solstice , the perfect time . Have you any idea who it 's using ? Nothing definite . I need to get closer to make contact . - Well then , make contact . - Steel , I need something tangible . Tony Purnell 's champagne glass . It 's his last physical contact since the girl 's death . No one has touched it since he put it down . You can start there . 'Anthony Purnell , son of a merchant banker . 'Fast cars , expensive clothes ... 'money ... women ... ' It 's that barrier again , Steel . ' Break through it . 'Tony Purnell ... He was here only a few days ago . 'June the 18th . ' 'This year ? Who did he come to see ? Mullrine ? ' 'No , no , he was in London . 'Purnell came to see someone else in this house . 'Mullrine 's secretary ! ' 'Purnell came to see ? ' 'Ann Shaw . 'In Mullrine 's office , here . 'Behind that green door . 'They 're kissing ... 'No ... Oh , she 's angry with him . 'She knows about Veronica Blamey . She 's jealous . ' 'He tells her not to worry . 'He says Veronica will not be a threat . 'He says he can easily get rid of her . - Purnell . - Where ? I don 't know . Somewhere in the house . A gunshot , I think . When ? Soon . What on earth ? - Sir . - What is it ? There 's no sign of Mr Purnell , sir . - No sign at all ? - No servants have seen him . That 's impossible . A man can 't disappear into thin air . At least try to grow up . - Did you find anything ? - Nothing . His room 's a shambles . He 's not there . - I can 't find him anywhere . - He can 't get out . That 's right , no one can . Now look here , I want to know what the devil 's going on . - For starters , who are you two ? - I beg your pardon ? - We 're not gate-crashers . - That 's not the question ! Yes , who are you ? I don 't remember . Remember ... I doubt if any of you can remember very much . - What are you talking about ? - A tear in the fabric of time . I read somewhere that the inability to remember is one symptom . - Sorry , you 're not making sense . - I can remember perfectly . - Can you ? - Yes . Where were you three days ago ? Here . - No . - London , then . - Correct . - What were you doing there ? - What I always do . Business . - Go on . At my club , the Denver , for lunch and in the evening to the Tivoli . - Impossible . - Are you calling me a liar ? Sir , it is impossible for you to have done those things . The Tivoli closed its doors for the last time in 1934 and the Denver was , I believe , blitzed in 1941 . - You see ? - It 's some sort of trick ! Is it ? Where were you yesterday , Mr Harborough ? Where did you have lunch today , Mrs Harborough ? What is the registration number of your car , Mr McDee ? Can 't remember ? No ? Well , what kind of a car is it ? What make , Mr McDee ? Well , it 's a ... Oh , no . Oh , yes . By now none of us can remember arriving here tonight . - Nor why we came . - Come and sit down , Miles . Thank you . Now it is impossible to know what is happening outside this house . Assuming that there is an outside to the house . The clock is moving backwards . For the moment there is no past ... and no future . There was a murder , I remember that . - Was there ? - I found the body ! Don 't be stupid ! Then let us refresh our memories . - If Greville would kindly ... - Of course , sir ! ... remove the sheet from the body . - Look here , that 's obscene . - Sir ? Yes , go ahead . ... changing , bodies disappearing . There 's no logic , I don 't like it ! The girl was murdered , there was a knife in her back ! And now she 's gone and Tony Purnell 's disappeared . - There is a logic to it . - Rubbish ! If we can find it . My memory 's gone completely , I can 't remember where I had lunch today . I can 't even remember my own car . - No logic and no sense to it . - No , there is a sense to it . You see , Lord Mullrine provided the setting - a party , a celebration back in 1930 , everything authentic . And set in a house that sits astride an ancient ley line . Miles , what exactly is a ley line ? A line of increased magnetic activity on the earth 's surface . - Birds navigate by them . - And then there 's the date . The summer solstice . No , it 's all very significant . June the 21st , 1930 . That 's today ! Yes , today , but 50 years ago . What was he doing ? I mean , what was he working on ? Why don 't you ask him yourself - he 's here . - You can 't interrupt him ! - This is absurd ! Felix , no ! Don 't you dare go in there . You can 't get in , anyway . Tony Purnell may be in there . We 're talking about George McDee . About his work . George never talks about his work , at least until it 's finished . You must have some idea . - Yes , it 's a medicine of some sort . - Medicine ? Yes , he 's in there messing about with genetics . Biology and all that . Have you ever heard anything so ludicrous ! 'Genetic engineering ! ' 'Serum biology ! ' Someone at the Ministry swallowed the idea . - It 's very secret . Hush-hush . - A medicine for which disease ? All of them - he 's talking about giving it to the whole population . George ... 'What was he doing , Sapphire ? What was he working on ? ' 'He ... He 's almost succeeded . 'He 's very close . 'He 's broken the genetic code . He 's replacing ... 'No , he 's manipulating the genetic characteristics of a virus . 'It will save thousands of lives . 'One more day , Steel - one more day and he will succeed . ' 'To save lives ? Then why should it keep him alive ? ' 'Because he 's careless , Steel . 'He will cause the extinction of life on this planet . ' 'So on June 21st 1930 this planet faces extinction ? Unless ... ' On June 22nd George McDee dies . - No ! What are you saying ? - That 's tomorrow ! How do you know my grandfather dies tomorrow ? - Because he has to . - If you 're so clever , at what time ? Arthur , we 've got a little bit of a problem . " A little bit of a problem , " says Emma . - It 's dinner . Greville 's anxious . - Dinner ? Who can think about dinner ? Somebody has to . We 've got jugged hare and lots of lovely other things . The kitchen staff went to a great deal of trouble . Is nobody hungry ? Mr Purnell , sir , they 've been looking for you ! - Yes , I know . - You all right , sir ? No , I 'm not . Someone or something tried to kill me . - I 'll tell Lord Mullrine , sir . - No ! Tell Cavendish , tell him I must speak to him . - Yes , sir . - No one else , Greville ! Just as you say , sir . Why don 't you sit down , sir ? What is so significant about 1930 ? What happened here 50 years ago ? If we find out who it is , we 'll know . Try George McDee again . He must have had this in his hands at some time . - You want a manifestation ? - Yes , from 1922 . It 's difficult . It 's a long time ago and it 's too dangerous . Give it a try . Yes , he was in this room some time during that day . - But I can 't tell when . - Sapphire ... Mr McDee ? Yes ? What do you want ? To talk . I 've no time for that , I 've work to do . - Are you one of Arthur 's flappers ? - Not exactly . Aye , well , you 'd better get back out there . Surely Emma 's about to organise one of those daft games . Sardines , I shouldn 't wonder . We 've already played that . I 've no time for idle chat . What do you know of deoxyribonucleic acid , Mr McDee ? What ? ! The transference of coded genetic material . Cloning bacteria to produce your vaccine . How do you know about that ? ! Has Arthur been blethering ? ! Do you know the danger involved ? There is no danger ! The only danger is to the millions who may die without my vaccine . Such procedures must be carefully controlled . - They are controlled ! - Bacteria can escape . - It couldn 't happen . - You cannot be certain . Even if it did they 'd be killed off ! They could never withstand the change in temperature . Is it not possible for a strain of bacteria not only to withstand the change in temperature but to become immune and therefore lethal ? Are you a scientist ? I can tell you what will happen if you don 't stop your work . Are you one of Alec Fleming 's lot ? Others will come later , able to control genetic engineering . - You don 't have the facilities ! - I 've lost him ! Of course I have the facilities ! I 've been working on this for six years ! - How dare you ! - Mr Cavendish ! - I 'm sorry , did I disturb you ? - Yes , you did , Greville . - It 's Mr Purnell , sir . - You found him ? He 's in the dining room , sir . He appeared somewhat dishevelled . He said he wanted to see you , sir . - ' Don 't go ! ' - Of course . - Nobody else . - Certainly . Mr Purnell led me to believe that it was rather urgent , sir . Don 't go , Steel . - What is it ? - Listen . You told me . You forgot . - That was a gunshot , sir ! - Yes , it was ! From inside the dining room . Nobody takes guns into dining rooms . - Emma , stop your prattling . - It might be Tony . Where are Howard and Felix ? Felix went upstairs to get some cigarettes . I thought Howard was in the library . - No , he isn 't . - Well , let 's get in there ! Tony ? ! And then there were eight . - Suicide . - It 's out of his reach . - He killed her and shot himself . - There 's no reason for this ! There 's a reason for all of it . The time change , the murders , - the barrier around this house . - It 's just hard to pinpoint . If you don 't pinpoint it quickly there won 't be any of us left !

 This is the worst shit I 've ever seen , man . Have you got any biscuits over there ? Here 's some cornbread . Cornbread . Yeah . I am cold . Still with us , Brett ? Right . I feel dead . Anybody ever tell you you look dead , man ? Oh , yeah , right . I just forgot something , man . Before we dock ... I think we ought to discuss the bonus situation . Right . Brett and I think we deserve full shares . Mr. Parker and I feel the bonus situation ... has never been on an equitable level . You 'll get what you contracted for , like everybody else . But everybody else gets more than us . Dallas , Mother wants to talk to you . Yeah , I saw it . Yellow light 's for my eyes only . OK , get dressed , huh ? Parker , let 's go . Can I finish my coffee ? It 's the only thing good on this ship . Good morning , Mother . Right ? OK . Plug us in . Thank you . Where 's Earth ? You should know . It 's not our system . Scan . I can 't believe this . Contact traffic control . This is commercial towing vehicle Nostromo ... out of the Solomons ... registration number 1-8-0-9er 2-4-6-0-9er ... calling Antarctica Traffic Control . Do you read me ? Over . Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo ... out of the Solomons ... registration number 1-8-0-9er 2-4-6-0-9er . - Nothing . - Keep trying . Calling Antarctica Traffic Control . Do you read me , Antarctica ? Over . I found it . Just short of Zeta II Reticuli . We haven 't reached the outer rim yet . That 's hard to believe . Calling Antarctica ... What the hell are we doing out here ? I don 't know . What the hell are you talking about ? That 's not our system . I know that . You ever notice how they never come down here ? I mean , this is where the work is , right ? The same damn reason we get a half share to their one . Our time is their time . That 's the way they see it . Same old shit , man . I know why they don 't come down here . It 's because of you . You have no personality . Wonder what they want now ? What 's going on down here ? You happen to be in my seat . Can I have it ? - Yes . - Thank you . Sorry . What 's happening now , baby ? Well , some of you may have figured out ... we 're not home yet . We 're only halfway there . What ? Mother 's interrupted the course of our journey . Why ? She 's programmed to , should certain conditions arise . - They have . - Like what ? Seems she has intercepted ... a transmission of unknown origin . She got us up to check it out . A transmission ? Out here ? Yeah . What kind of a transmission ? Acoustical beacon . It repeats at intervals of twelve seconds . - S.O.S. ? - I don 't know . Human ? Unknown . So what ? We 're obligated under Section B-two - I hate to bring this up ... but this is a commercial ship , not a rescue ship . It 's not in my contract to do this kind of duty . You want to give me some money to do it , I 'll be happy to . - Parker . - The man 's right . Let 's go over the bonus situation . Can I say something ? Let 's talk about the bonuses . There is a clause which specifically states ... any systematized transmission ... indicating a possible intelligent origin ... must be investigated . I don 't want to hear it . I want to go home and party . Parker , will you just listen to the man ? On penalty of total forfeiture of shares . No money . You got that ? Well , yeah . All right , we 're going in . Yeah , we 're going in , aren 't we ? Approaching orbital apogee . Mark . Twelve , eleven ... Equatorial orbit nailed . - Main stabilizers in . - Eight seconds on descent . Grids energized . Fields focused . Five , four ... Put the D.O.R.s in-line . How 's the status on the lifters ? Give me an A.C. pressure reading . Forty-eight seconds and counting . SR-one stable . Prepare to disengage from platform . Twenty seconds . Eighteen , seventeen ... sixteen , fifteen ... fourteen , thirteen ... twelve , eleven , ten ... seven , six ... five , four ... three , two , one , lock . Disengage . OK . Money 's safe . Let 's take her down . Roll 92 degrees port yaw . Prime the port . Prime ventral . Prime dorsal . Down a degree . Nine hundred meters and dropping . Thirty-nine thousand . Turbulence . Locked and floating . Drop us any time now . Inertial damping 's going off . Hold on , people , there 's gonna be a little bump . What the hell was that ? Pressure dropping in deck three . Must 've lost a shield . Let 's go with it . Dropping off now . Still dropping . There we are . We 've got it . Take her down . Navigation lights on . We 've got five-three still out . No problem . Just down eleven percent . Grid status ... OK . Fifteen meters and dropping . Twelve , eleven , ten ... nine , eight ... seven , six ... five , four ... three , two , one . Kill drive engines . What the hell happened ? Somebody give me a straight answer ! - Is the hull breached ? - We 've still got pressure . Hit the screens . Secondary load-sharing unit is out . Three of the four cells are gone . Is that it ? Hold on . We can 't fix it out here anyway . We need to reroute a couple of these ducts . Dry-dock time . Dry-dock . Tell them we need to dry-dock . We couldn 't fix it out here anyway . We got to reroute all these ducts . In order to do that , we 've got to dry-dock . What else ? Some fragments caked up ... and we 've got to clean it all out and repressurize it . How long before we 're functional ? What ? Seventeen hours , tell him . At least twenty-five hours . Get started . I 'll be right down . What 's she coming down here for ? She 'd better stay the fuck out of my way . I 'd like to see what she 'll do . Any response yet ? Nope . Absolutely nothing ... except the same transmission every twelve seconds . All the other channels are dead . Kick on the floods . We can 't go anywhere in this . Mm-hmm . Mother says the sun 's coming up in twenty minutes . How far are we from the source of transmission ? Northeast , just under two thousand meters . Walking distance ? Can you give me an atmospheric ? Yes . Oh . It 's almost primordial . There 's inert nitrogen ... high concentration of carbon dioxide crystals ... methane . I 'm working on the trace elements . Anything else ? Yes . There 's rock-lava base . Deep cold , well below the line . Mm-hmm . I 'll volunteer to be in the first group to go out . Yeah , that figures . You , too , Lambert . Swell . Better break out the weapons . I can 't see a goddamn thing . Ash , are you receiving ? Good contact on my board . Clear and free . Keep the line open . Let 's go . Hey , Ripley ! Hey , Ripley , I want to ask you a question . If they find what they 're looking for , does that mean we get full shares ? Don 't worry , Parker . Yeah . You 'll get whatever 's coming to you . Look , I 'm not going to do any more work ... till we get this straightened out . Brett , you 're guaranteed by law to get a share . What ? Why don 't you just fuck off ? What ? What did you say , Rip ? If you have any trouble , I 'll be on the bridge . Don 't worry about it , baby . Hey , Ripley . Come back here ! Ha ha ha ha ! Son of a bitch . What 's the matter ? I can 't see a goddamn thing . Quit griping . I like griping . Come on , knock it off . How 's it going ? All right . Have you tried putting that transmission ... through E.C.I.U. ? No . Mother hasn 't identified it yet . Do you mind if I give it a shot ? Please do . Ash , can you see this ? Yes , I can . I 've never seen anything like it . It 's very bizarre . You said it . All right . Moving on to second ... position . What is it ? Let 's get out of here . We 've come this far . We must go on . We have to go on . Will you say that again ? Shit . Ash , as you can see , it 's hard to describe . I 'm going back to the console . Seems to be solid ... to walk . You OK , Lambert ? Dallas ? Dallas ? Come on down here . Something different down here . I don 't know what it is , but ... See if we can get up that wall ... then get up that wall behind there . Amazing . An alien life form . Looks like it 's been dead a long time . Fossilized . Looks like it 's grown out of the chair . Oh . Bones are bent outward ... like he exploded from inside . I wonder what happened to the rest of the crew ? Let 's get the hell out of here . Dallas , Lambert ! Come on over here . Come on . - What have you got ? - See what you make of this . Ash , that transmission . Mother 's deciphered part of it . It doesn 't look like an S.O.S. What is it then ? It looks like a warning . I 'm going to go out after them . What 's the point ? I mean , by the time it takes to get there ... they 'll know if it 's a warning or not . Yes ? You OK down there ? Can you see anything ? I don 't know . A cave . A cave of some sort , but I ... I don 't know , but it 's like the goddamn tropics in here . What the hell is this ? The pit is completely enclosed ... and it 's full of leathery objects ... Like eggs or something . There 's a layer of mist just covering the eggs ... that reacts when broken . Kane ! You all right ? Yeah , I 'm OK . All right . I 'm OK . I just slipped . It appears to be completely sealed . Wait a minute . There 's movement . It seems to have life - organic life . You there , Ripley ? I 'm right here . OK , Ripley , I 'm at the inner lock hatch now . Right . - OK , Ripley . - Right here . We 're clean . Let us in . What happened to Kane ? Something has attached itself to him . We have to get him to the infirmary right away . What kind of thing ? I need a definition . An organism . Open the hatch . Wait a minute . It could infect the ship . You know the quarantine procedure - twenty-four hours for decontamination . He could die in twenty-four hours . If we break quarantine , we could all die . Open the goddamn hatch ! We have to get him inside ! No , I can 't do that . If you were in my position , you 'd do the same . This is an order . Open that hatch . Do you hear me ? Yes . Ripley , this is an order ! Do you hear me ? Yes , I read you . The answer is negative . Inner hatch opened . My God . What the hell is that ? How is he ? How are we going to get that off him ? How are we going to get it off ? Just a minute . Let me get some instruments . Oh , my God . All right . If I go for an incision here ... to try and remove one of the digitals from his face . You 're gonna do what ? Finger . I 'm going to try and get his finger off . Get this on there . It 's tearing his scalp . I know ! It 's not coming off without tearing his face off . We 'll have to take a look at him inside . How come they don 't freeze him ? How come you guys don 't freeze him ? All right , you can take your mask off . What 's it got down his throat ? I would suggest it 's feeding him oxygen . Paralyzes him , puts him in a coma ... then keeps him alive . Now , what the hell is that ? - We 've got to get it off him . - Just a minute . Let 's not be too hasty . We don 't know anything about ... it . Now , we 're assuming it 's feeding him oxygen . If we remove it ... it could kill him . I 'm willing to take that chance . Let 's cut it off now . You 'll take responsibility ? I 'll take responsibility . Get him out of there . Where do you want to do this ? We 'll make an incision just below the knuckle there . - Right here . - Stand by . Good God ! That crap 's gonna eat through the hull . It 's going to eat through the goddamn hull ! Come on ! What 's going on ? This way . Next deck . There it is ! Don 't get under it ! Don 't get under it ! Looks like it 's stopping . Take a look at this , man . Brett , what do you got , a pen ? Give it to me , quick . Come on ! Don 't get any on your arm . It stopped . Haven 't seen anything like that except molecular acid . It must be using it for blood . It 's got a wonderful defense mechanism . You don 't dare kill it . What about Kane ? Here 's your pen back . What do we do now ? Leave Kane to Ash . You get back to work . Well , what - OK . Try it . I thought sure that was it . Try it again . I feel like I 've been in this place a month . We shouldn 't have landed here in the first place . Shouldn 't have landed on this damn ball . I know that . The sooner we patch this thing up and get outta here ... the sooner we can go home . This place gives me the creeps . That 's amazing . What is it ? I 'd say it 's , um ... I don 't know yet . Do you want something ? Yes , I , uh ... would like to have a little talk . How 's Kane ? He 's holding . No changes . And , uh ... our guest ? Hmm . Hmm ? Well , as I said , I was still collating , actually ... but I have confirmed ... that he 's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides . He has a funny habit of shedding his cells ... and replacing them with polarized silicone ... which gives him a prolonged resistance ... to adverse environmental conditions . Is that enough ? That 's plenty . What does it mean ? Please don 't do that . Thank you . I 'm sorry . Well , it 's an interesting combination of elements ... making him a tough little son of a bitch . And you let him in . I was obeying a direct order , remember ? Ash , when Dallas and Kane are off the ship ... I 'm senior officer . Oh , yes , I forgot . You also forgot the science division 's ... basic quarantine law . - No , that I didn 't forget . - Oh , I see . You just broke it . Look , what would you have done with Kane ? His only chance of survival was to get him in here . Unfortunately , by breaking quarantine ... you risk everybody 's life . Maybe I should have left him outside . Maybe I 've jeopardized the rest of us ... but it was a risk I was willing to take . It 's a pretty big risk for a science officer . It 's not exactly out of the manual , is it ? I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you , you know . You do your job and let me do mine . Where 's Dallas ? In the shuttle . Dallas . I think you should have a look at Kane . Why ? Something 's happened . Serious ? Interesting . Ripley , meet me in the infirmary right away . Where is it ? I don 't know . We have to try and find it . Let 's check it . Dallas , please be careful . Aah ! Sorry . No , not in the corner ! Have one of these ... just in case . Kane ? Dallas ? Aah ! You OK ? I didn 't see it . Was it in the overhead ? What ? It was up there somewhere . My God . Cover the damn thing , will you ? It 's alive ! That 's a reflex action . Well , we 've got to have a look at this . Excuse me . Seems dead enough . Well , good . Let 's get rid of it . Ripley , for God 's sake , this is the first time ... that we 've encountered a species like this . It has to go back . Tests have to be made . Ash , are you kidding ? This thing bled acid . Who knows what it 'll do when it 's dead ? I think it 's safe to assume it isn 't a zombie . Dallas , it has to go back . I 'd soon as not burn it at the stake ... but you 're the science officer . It 's your decision , Ash . Dallas ! I won 't change my mind . The decision 's made . I 'm not trying to change your mind , Dallas . I just want you to listen . Will you listen to - Oh . How can you leave that decision to him ? I just run the ship . Anything to do with the science division ... Ash has the final word . How does that happen ? It happens because that 's what the Company wants . Since when is that standard procedure ? Standard procedure is to do ... what the hell they tell you to do . Did you ever ship out with Ash before ? I went out five times with another science officer . They replaced him two days before we left Thedus with Ash . I don 't trust him . I don 't trust anybody . What 's happening with the repairs ? They 're pretty much finished now . Why the hell didn 't you tell me so ? Because there 's still some things left to do . Like what ? We 're blind on " B " and " C " Decks . - The reserve power system is - - That 's a bunch of horseshit . We can take off without that . We can . You think that 's a good idea ? I just want to get the hell out of here . Dust in the intakes again . Number two is overheating . Spit on it for two minutes , would you , for Christ 's sake ? We 're hot , and we 're getting hotter . Engine room , red clip status ? One kilometer on ascension . Engage artificial gravity . Engaged . I 'm altering the vector ... now . Inhibit CNG control . Inhibit CNG control . - Struts retract . - Struts retracted . Max stress to fifth overload . Ease it back . Walk in the park ! We fix something , it stays fixed . Don 't we , Brett , baby ? Right . I think we should freeze him . If he 's got a disease , stop it where it is . He can get to a doctor when we get back home . Right . Whenever he says anything ... you say , " Right , " Brett . You know that ? Right . Parker , your staff follows you around ... and says , " Right , " just like a parrot . Shape up . You some kind of parrot ? - Right . - Knock it off ! Kane 's going into quarantine . That 's it ! Yes , and so will we . How about something to lower your spirits ? Thrill me , will you , please ? Well , according to my calculations ... based on time spent getting to and from the planet - Just give me the short version . - How far to Earth ? - Ten months . - Oh , God . - Great . Yes ? Dallas , I think you should come and see Kane . Has his condition changed ? It 's simpler if you just come and see him . We 're on our way . Right . How are you doing ? How you doing ? Oh , terrific . Next silly question . Oh , thank you . You remember anything about the planet ? What 's the last thing you do remember ? I remember some horrible dream about smothering , and ... Anyway , where are we ? - Right here . - On our way home . Back to the old freezerinos . I 've got to have something to eat before we go back . I need something myself . Yeah . One more meal before bedtime . I 'm buying . Hey , that 's a break . What-what happened to this guy ? The first thing I 'm gonna do when I get back ... is to get some decent food . I can dig it , man . I 've eaten worse food than this ... but then I 've tasted better , you know ? You pound it down like there 's no tomorrow . I 'd rather be eating something else ... but right now , I 'll stick to food . Well , you should know . You know what it 's made of . I don 't want to talk about what it 's made of . I 'm eating this . What 's the matter ? The food ain 't that bad , baby . - Are you choking ? - What 's wrong ? What ? Kane , what 's the matter ? - Get the spoon in ! - Hold him down ! Get the spoon in his mouth ! Damn it ! - Get it in his mouth ! - I 'm trying ! Aaahh ! Aah ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Aah ! Oh , God ! Don 't touch it ! Don 't touch it ! Dallas ? - Yeah . - Anything ? No . You ? Nothing . - Did you see anything ? - No . Inner hatch sealed . Anybody want to say anything ? This is an ordinary prod , like a cattle prod . It 's got a portable battery . It 's insulated all the way up to here . Just make damn sure nobody touches the end of it . Shouldn 't damage the little bastard ... unless its skin is thinner than ours ... but it will give him a little incentive . Now we just have to find it . I 've taken care of that . I 've designed this tracking device . You set it to search for a moving object . Hasn 't got much of a range , but when you get close ... it gives off a signal . What 's it key on ? Micro changes in air density . Give me a demo . - You see ? - Again . Gotcha . Two teams - Ash , Lambert , and I. Ripley , you take Parker and Brett . Now , anyone see this thing ... catch it in a net that Parker 's holding . Parker , I don 't want any heroics out of you , all right ? Catch it , put it in the airlock , and get rid of it . Channels are open on all decks . I want you to communicate at all times , all right ? Let 's go . I thought you fixed twelve module . We did . I don 't understand it . The circuits must have burned out . What have we got here ? Damn it . Hold your light over here , would you ? Yeah , that 's it . I don 't know if this will work . Maybe I can just put this in there . Right . Damn it . Check the insulation . Oh , shit . According to this , it 's within five meters . Let 's open the door . Micro changes in air density , my ass . It 's within five meters . Be careful . Don 't creep up on me with that thing . You guys stick together . Don 't fail me now . What ? What is it ? Parker , Brett . It 's in this locker . Get the net . I got it . I got it . Wait a minute . All right , Parker , when I say . All right , now . Easy . Wait ! Don 't let him go ! What the hell are you doing , man ? It 's the cat , man . Hey , look now . We had to bag it . Now we might pick it up on the tracker again . - I 'll-I 'll - - Go and get it , man . All right , you get him . We 'll go on . Here , kitty . Here , kitty , kitty . Enough of that kitty crap . Jones ! Jonesy ? Here , Jonesy ! Meow , meow . Jonesy ? Here , kitty , kitty , kitty . Meow . Here , Jonesy ! Jonesy . Here , kitty , kitty . Kitty , kitty , kitty . Here , Jonesy . Jonesy ! Kitty , kitty . Jonesy ? Hey , come on , Jonesy . Come on , baby . That 's a kitty . That 's a kitty . Come on , baby . That 's a kitty . Hey , hey , I 'm not going to hurt you . Come on . Aaaaaaah ! Whatever it was , it was big and ... You sure it took him into the air shaft ? Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts . It 's using the air ducts to move around . Could he want Brett alive ? What ? Could Brett be alive ? No . I mean , I don 't think so . This air shaft may work to our advantage . Here it leads up to and comes out ... in the main air lock . There 's only one big opening along the way . We 'll cover that up ... then we drive it into the air lock ... and zap it into outer space . The son of a bitch is huge ! It 's like a man . It 's big ! Kane 's son . Ash , the science department should help us . What can we do to drive it ? It 's adapted remarkably well to our atmosphere ... considering its nutritional requirements . We don 't know about temperature . What happens if we change it ? Let 's try it . Most animals retreat from fire . Fire , yeah . Parker , can you rig three or four incinerator units ? Give me about twenty minutes . I 'll do it . - Who gets to go into the vent ? - I do . No . You and Ash ... take the main air lock . Parker , Lambert ... you cover up that maintenance opening , please . Right . I 'm at the first junction . Dallas , I 'm right here . - Parker ? - Yeah . Lambert ? I 'm trying to get a reading . The air lock is open . OK , Ripley . Ready . Moving up . All right . I 've got a reading on you now . Uh , open the hatch to the third junction . OK , I 'm through . Ripley ? Yes . Close all the hatches behind me . I 'm moving on . Dallas , hold it a minute . I think I got it . - Yes , I 've got it . - Where ? Somewhere around the third junction . OK , moving on . It is right around there . Be careful . All right . I 've reached ... the third junction , and I 'm going down . What the hell 's the matter with that box ? Dallas , hold your position for a minute . I 've lost the signal . What ? You sure ? Are you sure that it 's not there ? It 's got to be around there somewhere . Check that out , Lambert . You may be getting interference . Are you sure there 's no sign of it ? It is there . It 's got to be around there . Dallas ? I can 't believe this is happening . All right . Uh , am I clear ? I want to get out of here . Oh , God , it 's moving right towards you ! Uh ... Move ! Get out of there ! It 's moving towards you ! Move ! Dallas ! Move , Dallas ! Move , Dallas ! Get out ! No , not that way ! The other way , Dallas ! Dallas ? - No ! - Take it easy . Dallas ? We found this laying there . No blood ... no Dallas ... nothing . How come nobody 's saying nothing ? I 'm thinking . Unless somebody has got a better idea ... we 'll proceed with Dallas ' plan . What ? And end up like the others ? Oh , no , you 're out of your mind ! - You got a better idea ? - Yes . I say that we abandon this ship . We get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here ! We take our chances and just hope that somebody - Lambert , shh . The shuttle won 't take four . Then why don 't we draw straws ? I 'm not drawing any straws . I 'm for killing that thing right now . OK . Well , let 's talk about killing it . We know it 's using the air shafts . Listen to me , Parker ! Shut up ! Let 's hear it . Let 's hear it . It 's using the air shafts . - We don 't know that . - That 's the only way ! We 'll move in pairs . We 'll go step by step and cut off every bulkhead ... and every vent until we have it cornered ... and then we 'll blow it the fuck out into space . Is that acceptable to you ? If it means killing it . Obviously , it means killing it ... but we have to stick together . How are our weapons ? The weapons are fine . This one needs refuelling . Will you get it , please ? Ash , go with him . No , I can manage , Ash . Don 't follow me . Ash ? Any suggestions from you or Mother ? No . We 're still collating . You 're what ? You 're still collating ? I find that hard to believe . What would you like me to do ? Just what you 've been doing , Ash - nothing . I 've got access to Mother now ... and I 'll get my own answers , thank you . All right . There is an explanation for this , you know . There is ? ! I don 't want to hear your goddamn explanation ! I don 't want to hear . I don 't want to hear . I ... Parker . Lambert ? Ash . Open the door . Ash ! Will you open the door ? Let me by , Ash . Aah ! Aah ! What the hell are you doing ? Aah ! Get her up ! Get her up ! Get her up ! Jesus ! It 's a robot ! Ash is a goddamn robot ! God ! Holy shit ! Help me get this fucking thing off ! Aah ! Oh , God ! Oh , Jesus ! Oh , God . Oh , God . How come the Company sent us a goddamn robot ? They must 've wanted the alien ... for their weapons division . He 's been protecting it right along . Parker , will you plug it in ? Uh , I don 't know why - Because he may know how to kill it . Ash , can you hear me ? Ash ! Yes , I can hear you . What was your special order ? You read it . I thought it was clear . What was it ? Bring back life form . Priority one . All other priorities rescinded . That damn Company ! What about our lives , you son of a bitch ? I repeat-all other priorities are rescinded . How do we kill it , Ash ? There 's got to be a way of killing it . How do we do it ? You can 't . That 's bullshit ! You still don 't understand what you 're dealing with . The perfect organism . Its structural perfection ... is matched only by its hostility . You admire it . I admire its purity . A survivor - unclouded ... by conscience ... remorse ... or delusions of morality . I 've heard enough of this . I 'm asking you to pull the plug . Last word , Ripley . What ? I can 't lie to you about your chances , but ... you have my sympathies . We 're going to blow up the ship . We 'll take our chances in the shuttle . - Blow up the ship . - Good . Come on . When we throw the switches ... how long before the ship blows ? - Ten minutes . - No bullshit . If we ain 't out in ten minutes ... we won 't need no rocket to fly through space . We 'll need coolant for the air-support system . You two get all the coolant you can carry . I 'll get the shuttle ready . I 'll give you about seven minutes . Come back up here , I 'll shut the switches off ... and we 'll blow this fucker off into space . OK . Come on . - Ready ? - Take care of yourself . Seven minutes . Take it easy . Jones ? Jones ? All right . OK , check the bottles . Jones ? - How you doing ? - Fine . Kitty ? OK , go ahead . Jones ? Psst , psst , psst . Kitty , kitty , kitty . Come here , Jones . Come here . Jones ? Come here , boy . Come here . Nice kitty . Jones ? Jones ? Come here . Come here , sweetheart . Jones . Jones . Jones ? Jonesy . Aah ! Aah ! Jones ! God damn it ! Now I got you . Here , sweetheart . Nice kitty . Oh , my God ! Get out of the way ! I can 't ! Get out of the way ! It 's going to kill us ! No , I can 't ! For Christ 's sake , get out of the way ! Lambert ! Get out of the way , Lambert ! Parker ? Lambert ? Lambert . Parker . Uhh ! Aah ! Aah ! Get out of the room ! No ! No ! Lambert ! Aah ! Aah ! Oh , God ! Aah ! Parker ? Ohh . Oh ! Danger . The emergency destruct system is now activated . The ship will detonate in T-minus ten minutes . The option to override automatic detonation ... expires in T-minus five minutes . The option to override automatic detonation ... expires in T-minus three minutes . The option to override automatic detonation ... expires in T-minus one minute . Twenty-nine , twenty-eight ... twenty-seven , twenty-six ... twenty-five , twenty-four ... twenty-three , twenty-two ... twenty-one ... twenty seconds . Nineteen , eighteen ... seventeen , sixteen ... fifteen , fourteen ... thirteen , twelve ... eleven ... ten seconds . Nine , eight ... seven , six ... five , four ... Come on ! three , two , one . The option to override detonation procedure ... has now expired . Mother , turn the cooling unit back on ! Mother ! The ship will automatically destruct ... in T-minus five minutes . You bitch ! God damn it ! Jones . You now have one minute to abandon ship . The ship will automatically destruct ... in T-minus one minute . T-minus thirty seconds ... twenty-eight-eight ... twenty-six-six ... twenty-four-four ... twenty-three ... twenty-two , twenty-one ... twenty seconds . Nineteen , eighteen , seventeen ... sixteen , fifteen ... fourteen , thirteen ... twelve , eleven ... ten seconds . Nine , eight , seven ... six , five ... four , three ... two , one . I got you ... you son of a bitch . Shh , shh , shh . It 's all right . Shh , shh , shh . Shh , Jonesy . Silly boy . All right . It 's nice to see you , too . Shh , shh , shh , shh . It 's OK . Aah ! Come on . You Are My lucky star You Are my lucky star You Lucky , lucky , lucky , lucky , lucky OK . Oh , come on . You are My lucky star You Are my lucky star You , you 're my lucky star You are my lucky star Oh , God . OK . OK . Aah ! Final report of the commercial starship Nostromo ... third officer reporting . The other members of the crew - Kane , Lambert ... Parker , Brett ... Ash ... and Captain Dallas - are dead . Cargo and ship destroyed . I should reach the frontier in about six weeks . With a little luck , the network will pick me up . This is Ripley ... last survivor of the Nostromo ... signing off . Come on , cat .

 In the 30 's , an American secret society became quite notorious . Its members rejected the whole idea of love , deemed art to be evil , and claimed to find the so-called " RAPTURE OF BEING " through a total liberation of the senses . After a congress was held by those adepts in New York , in September 1937 , they were never heard of again . One year later , a reporter thought he found them again in the middle of uncharted territories . He vanished too . This film tells the story of how some of their daughters came back to live among us . We can 't leave her like this . I gave orders . They 're coming to get her . Stop erasing that drawing . They 're waiting for us . I 'm ready . What 's that laughter outside ? Samantha is initiating Leonardo . Group eight is expected at 8 : 30 . - Group eight has already arrived . The packing teams must make haste . Ah , you 're here ! She couldn 't take it anymore . All seduction equipment is to leave with the commandos . Get up , little Felicia . Group six . Group six is expected ... I don 't want to see my body . It 's too grotesque . The packing team in charge of group six must make haste . Let us go now , my children . The others will follow . I can 't get used to the voices they 've given us . Their females still have voices like this . I 've been told they conceal themselves when they make love . Let 's go . These are my final orders . You have been chosen to establish a beachhead for our coming invasion . Your willpower is now strong enough to conquer the world that once exiled us . We made you beautiful because where you 're going , beauty is still held in high regard . Go , and fight this world where love is still considered a virtue . Go , and castrate all the masters . All those who make others live in fear . L 'AMOUR EST UN FLEUVE EN RUSSIE [ LOVE IS A RIVER IN RUSSIA ] Here are your roses ! Somewhere in our world . - Are you crazy ? No ... stop ! Her name is Cascade . No . No , leave me alone . Stop it . Stop it . You 're such an animal ! I 'm getting married tomorrow anyway , you know . Will you cut the bullshit , already ? Pierre , the gardener . Don 't you know everyone is fed-up with your foolishness ? Madame Papadéous , Cascade 's aunt . Please don 't touch Sala 's dress ! She 's getting married , not you . Prepare some chocolate for Choupetit . I 've got to hurry ! Mr. Grop is waiting for me . Choupetit , her son . Your chocolate is coming , my little angel . Cascade is making it now . You still haven 't kissed me today . Oh no , don 't do that . Come on , are you mad ? No ... Hey ! Where 's that chocolate ? What the hell are you doing ? Choupetit is waiting . It can 't go on like this , you know , I 'm warning you . And don 't forget your cousin 's book . I wonder where those two are . Do you know ? - Goodbye , my darling . - Goodbye , mama . Damned bugs ! Ah , here you are . Follow me . - Hello , my dear friend . - Yeah , hello , sorry . Mr. Grop , the village mayor . Please forgive me if I hurry . I can 't see you long , ' cause I 'm very busy . Please , take a seat . I asked you to come because I 've been commissioned with a sale . The house next to you ... the Fogle villa . Well , it 's been sold . Werner , Grop 's right hand man . It all happened in a very unusual manner . First , there was an intervention by some big wig at the Prefecture . Then some phone calls from the capital . You know me , I like to be aware of everything . Yes . These people will probably move in soon . So I 'm asking you , since you 're their neighbor to keep an eye on things , just so we know with whom we 're dealing . Excuse me , but I 'm in a real hurry , I 'm a very busy man . Werner , will you be good enough to see ... - ... Mme. Papadéous to the door . - Good morning , Madame . - How is Sala ? - She 's fine . Oh , yes , speaking of the wedding I think it 's ridiculous ! For a young man who plans on going into politics marrying Sala Papadéous is madness ! Blanche , M. Grop 's wife , and her servant . Please do it again . I love it . I see your pleasures are as high brow as ever . We 're just having fun . Don 't you have anything else to do ? What ? Don 't forget you are Madame Grop . As some of us may recall , during the 1930 's the American public got all excited about a secret society whose adepts were believed to have acquired supernatural powers through unusual training methods . I must have left a handkerchief around here . Here , wait . I let him get away with all this . Oh , I 'm such a coward . - Why do you say that ? - How I wish I weren 't this way . In late May 1935 the members of the sect gathered in the lounge of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York . It seems a decision was reached at the end of this congress since from that moment on , they were never heard from again . The town 's cabaret . - Did you see the glasses ? - What do I care ? - You 're too much , you know that ? - Time to go to bed , gramps ! - Hi , guys ! - Hi ! Oh shit ... I don 't want to watch that ! Cover yourself up with this rag . I 've got work to do . Fucking artists ! Cut the bullshit , will you . Here are Ruth and Ivan . They live with Tristan , an artist . Hi . Can you still see what you 're doing ? Yeah , I 've got to finish this painting by tomorrow . Why aren 't you asleep ? And how 's our star ? Come on , come on , you 've got to sleep now . Don 't you think you 're overdoing it a bit ? Go fuck yourself . - Why are you like this ? - Because he 's making fun of me . The little girl we just saw , is Ruth 's daughter . As for the blonde , her name is Rita . - Trying to make yourself beautiful ? - Does this bother you ? God , this place is a madhouse ! I think ... the transvestite , the painter the sassy black girl and her poor child . You 're on the wrong path , father if you begin to feel pity for such creatures . Nowadays , people tend to forget about the devil ! Yes , absolutely ... the devil ! The point is , the devil may not always be where you expect him . - Monsignor ? - What do you want ? - Your permission to go to bed . - Go , go ! This is the cardinal 's house . He lives with his secretary and Marie , the housekeeper . Is she as submissive as she seems ? She 's going to be the first one . - Why her ? - Because she 's so unhappy . I don 't care for the nonsense that you entertain these days , father . " Give this ring to its rightful owner . " The one he 's been wearing since July 7 , 1957 is a fake . " Come and join us . We will satisfy your hunger . " Our voices are already being heard among the monsters . This one is unhappy , isn 't she ? She is only saved by the music in her head . Music ? It 's one of her ways to feel less lonely . She hates him . Yes , but there 's also a strange scent of tenderness . Werner visits Sala Papadéous , his fiancée . - Good morning , madam . - Good morning . Come on , go to your room ! I forbid you to leave . - Mademoiselle had arranged a rendezvous . - Yes , I know . Liberte , Sala 's sister . Watch this ! Blanche ! Go get my plane ! I wonder who will rid me of that woman ! - Grop , don 't be childish ! - Well , what 's so important ? You know my housekeeper ? Yesterday , she came to me claiming that she had a ... a visitor . - A visitor ? - Yes .. Yes . She was visited by a being ... some sort of female being . Well , she doesn 't really know . So , yes , I roared with laughter , as you would have . But the strange thing is the visitor left proof that she 'd been there . - Proof ? - A ring . A ring perfectly identical to my own . She claimed that mine was a fake , and hers was genuine . And you believe this bullshit ? Look . The point is not believing or disbelieving . It might be more than just poppycock , ... and I think that perhaps it is a matter concerning your police . Because this morning I had the rings examined by an expert . Mine is fake , hers is genuine . Is that you ? I threw everybody out . It 's so difficult for us to meet . Do you recognize your cute little ass ? Watch what I do to it . Do you still love me ? How did you manage to escape from your aunt and your two bitch cousins ? What is it ? Will she be coming ? Why are you here ? Why are you here ? I came because ... I told myself since you were supposed to see Cascade , with the intention of ... So , I thought ... You 're a whore ! Get out ! Leave ! Slut ... Asshole ! The cardinal 's housekeeper answers the Spermulans ' call . - Well , I see she came . - Why is she afraid ? Freedom frightens slaves . It forced us to create these bodies , since their world had destroyed their imagination . My name is Gilda . I 'm the one who came to you the first time . You will meet our mistress today . No , I 've changed my mind . Are you aware that you have fantastic psychic power ? Why do we inspire such terror ? They fear being different . Did you see the dread in her eyes ? She couldn 't bear her newfound freedom . Now she 's one of us . When she wakes up , you will take her back . We need her away from this place . Oh , it 's you , mama . How about that ! Is she crazy , or what ? Some people care about politics ! We care about music , partying and magic ! The following morning ... I " ll bet that nigger bitch never fed him . Where 's my dog ? Well , here 's his meat . Look where that stupid woman left my plane ! Do you know where the dog is ? Can 't you stop that ? Will you stop already ! You sure are pretty like that . You make me want to puke . - If only you knew ! - If I knew what ? A pig , that 's what you are ! A monstrosity ! If only you knew ... how I love you . How I love you ... You 're a good man , husband . Nice ... very nice . Perfect . You 're perfect . You pretend to like it , don 't you , bitch ? Don 't you pretend to like it ? - Yes ! - No ! Come in . - Mr. Werner is here . - Tell him to come in . You really are a bastard . Good morning , Mme Grop . Good morning , Werner . You 'll excuse me ... The green-eyed young man who came to see us . Is he on our side ? Yes . His name is Werner . He 's strange ... It 's difficult to fathom his vibrations . He 's the right hand man of the most powerful man in this town but he 's also been an adept of ours for ten of their years . Nevertheless , he seems very preoccupied with matters of material power . Whatever . We need him . You always come at the right moment . You 're still your old , vulgar self . Your own rudeness proves you 've got good news for me . What do you mean ? What I mean , you little cocksucker , is that you wouldn 't dare to insult me if you weren 't on the right track . I think I found the money . Bravo . It was about time . Who ? We 'll see about that later . But I have one condition . A junior partner title and ... Don 't be put off by their stories ... It doesn 't matter what confidence trick those two men may have pulled . And it doesn 't matter that it was perpetrated on the town they are in charge of . It doesn 't matter that this woman is searching . The only thing that matters , is the rotten stench bathing their lives . I already told you I was opposed to this marriage . - I 'm off . - All right , all right . Do as you wish . I don 't care . When will it be ? I thought the day after tomorrow . Where is the money coming from ? He thinks you 're going to give him the money . To them , money is everything . Leave them alone . You 're exhausting yourself . Let 's get back to work . You 're right . Is everyone ready ? We shall resume our immodesty practice . You ! Go and fetch the male subject . To survive ... to live forever . On the other side , there is sunlight . It 's there , within our reach . You must hate all men and their tyranny . But women ! The best of them will gladly oblige , and will give life to our dreams . At last ! I knew you would come . Sala Papadéous . Liberte 's sister and Werner 's fiancée . Is mama sleeping ? - What about Choupetit ? - I don 't know . The superstitious are afraid of mirrors for a good reason . Mirrors hold a secret , and a frightful secret it is . There 's absolute truth on the other side . In that other space in which deception doesn 't exist . Look at my face . Watch it closely . As if you were seeing it for the first time . My face is a show . You are attending my face 's show . You are with me . My face is becoming an eternal object . A landscape . Follow me as we cross to the other side . Yes ... yes ... yes ... I don 't love you anymore . We will never see each other again . The sunrise . Sala ! - Here 's your fiancée . - Hello ... - You seem pretty self-assured . - If you only knew . If I only knew what ? If I only knew what , Werner ? Stop it ! I know perfectly well that you don 't want to do it . It drives me crazy . Kiss it ! - Do I smell good ? - Like a flower . It takes a gardener to water such a flower . That 's enough of that ... - Ruth ! Ruth ! - Yes . Okay ... I love you . I love you too , little man . No , no , of course not ! You 're missing the point entirely . You don 't have a clue . It was like this , I tell you . Here you are . You 're beautiful . Where the hell are you going ? I 've got work to do in the garden . He was a ... great hairdresser . An artist . There ... Make sure that your beauty doesn 't deceive you . Remember your true faces . Gilda ! Are you crazy ? You may not become attached to anyone . Do you understand ? You must hate your faces , these jewels , those ludicrous dresses everything that makes you objects of desire in this world . I 'm telling you this , because I can sense some of you are weakening . I can sense everything . Ever since I was a child ... We must act . We 've got the cardinal 's housekeeper . That one will be next . They 've been here for three weeks . In order to know so many people they must have had supporters in our town . She even met with Tristan , that painter you don 't like and commissioned a portrait from him . She met all my former friends from the cabaret . I think those women have abnormal powers . They are psychic . Are you crazy ? What is all this bullshit ? First the Cardinal , now you . A madwoman , that 's what you are . Psychic ! Have you been seeing a fortune-teller ? You 're mad . You 're insane . Here ! Look at yourself ! Look ! Remember . That youthful Blanche Dubois . The beautiful artist . Now a sick wreck ... no more . What do you think ? - Mme Grop is tired . - That 's not what I mean . If you 're referring to those women ... I think ... please forgive me , madam but I think the whole thing is preposterous . You can say that again . I 'm going to bed , that 's the best thing I can do . Preposterous ? I 've known you for a long time . Do you remember , Madame Grop ? Please , show no interest in their stories . Stories were good for men of the past . Know only that a being of light must exist in the present . If you fuck with me , even a little , I 'll destroy you . Little Werner . I must say , this is wonderful . He 's terribly repressed . Look . Yes . He can 't rise above commonplace visions . He knows only the primary phase . You 've got to mutate him . I can 't . Yes you can . He 's come to the other side now . He is ours . Now you are free . No pride , no anguish . You 'll never be a man of the past again . She was the most profound , the most visionary of them all and she allowed herself to fall into the crudest , the most illusory of traps . - Love ... - Did she have a bad night ? - Yes . - I 'll go and see her . I don 't understand why she was chosen . She lacks strength . Here , take this . It will do you good . Close the curtains , will you ? I can 't bear the light . Aren 't you feeling well , darling ? It 's nothing . Probably this world . I miss teaching . Today , we 'll resume our listening . I 've sensed something strange since earlier today . There is love around here , I can feel it . And it makes me want to puke . You 're being silly . There 's only hate among our neighbors . Shut up ! I feel it , I tell you ! You 're tickling me . You 're really crazy , aren 't you ? That 's funny . I feel like eating you up . I 'll swallow you . I 'll digest you . You 're disgusting . That 's rich , coming from you , who only likes talking about sex . That 's true . I like it . Why do you suppose I like it ? It 's because ... because you 're ... You 're wicked ! This is really fucking good . Really good . My man ! You 're so silly ! What 's happening with the gardener ? - It seems to have failed . - Why do you say that ? Because I can see it . He 's not been freed in the right way . - What do you want ? - Is your mother home ? No ... What 's the matter ? Are you crazy ? What 's with you ? You 're not yourself ! Take a seat . Blanche , my darling , will you close the door ? I asked you to come here tonight to announce Werner 's promotion and his engagement to Sala Papadéous . I 'm so happy . But I also want to talk to you about something else ... I suspect that what happened to you is somehow happening to me . If you 're anything like me ... Oh , no ! My love is much deeper than that . Will you excuse me ? ... and I asked Werner to investigate . No result . What 's really bothering me , is that each time I posed a question about those people to someone in the capital ... - Would you like a drink ? - I 'd like a glass of water , please . Each time , they led me to understand that I 'd better ... well , in a nutshell ... leave the matter alone . That 's why I think it 's our responsibility to shed some light on it . So I 'm asking you , Countess , and also you , Your Eminence to pay a visit to those people in order to learn with whom we are dealing . Yes . I understand . Thank you . Werner warns us that the Cardinal is interested in coming to dinner in order to learn about us . An investigation of sorts . Come and see . It 's strange She kept looking over her shoulder , as if she could feel my presence . I think she 's a natural at listening . - When was this ? - Thirty-six hours ago . We should be able to do it . That man , Grop , no longer has any male fluid . We can only reach him through her . Blanche will be theirs soon . As for the Cardinal , they 're waiting for him that very evening . And the next morning ... Some friends told me you weren 't feeling very well . I 'm all right , don 't worry . Images are coming back to me . When I had dinner with Cardinal . I 've noticed that the color of your robe your complexion and these little prawns all go together nicely . Thank you . - It was nice of you to invite me . - I 'm glad to see you . Why have you covered the paintings like this ? I find it soothes me . Do you know why ? No ... So this is their alternative to crossing to the other side ... Love ... my little trick ... In fact , Monsignor , you probably understand us better than many others . My companions and I are living in a kind of community . Yes , I see . Did you know we own some extraordinary collections ? Do you ? And we 'd like to show you some of our treasures ... I 'd like to learn how to draw . Would you like to try ? Maybe I would , yes . What 's wrong with me ? I 'm going crazy . Are you all right ? I cannot stay . I need to wash my hands . Thank you . Oh , yes , I 'm all right . Well ... I just think I need to rest . Please excuse me . I 'm feeling a bit dizzy . I 'll ... I " ll leave you here . You may stay as long as you want . May I take your drawing ? Well ... yes . Although I don 't like it much . Thank you . - What 's the matter with her ? - I don 't know . She 's scaring me . She 's just a little strange . You 're pretty when you 're scared . You 're crazy . She 'll be back . Concentrate . Lead him to the swimming pool , where the others are waiting for him . Erase the drawing , Ingrid . Erase it now . Make it like before . Nothing must remain . I can 't . I can 't go on . Time is shifting . It 's their doing . Their love is destroying you . - Free yourself from them , Ingrid . - I can 't . - I 'll do it for you . - No . They 're my responsibility . Help me ! - You 're their master , Ingrid . - Leave me alone , then . Leave me . I 'm leaving you . But remember that you must flee their poets , those who already own a version of the rapture . They produce substitutes of life that help people weather the bad times . That help people weather the bad times . He 's coming closer . He 's almost here . He 's here ! As for this couple , I think you see too much of them . And I think asking him for that drawing was ridiculous . Before , you insisted on erasing them . - It was so simple ... - This is none of your business . I like them . If only they didn 't reek so much of love ... You must free them of this filth . What are you waiting for ? Do what must be done . They are grotesque . - I make the decisions . - You make the decisions . We 're not well . We have to resume the listenings . Tell me , how many times did the artist come here ? He came three times in the flesh , and several times more as waves . - When was the first time ? - The first time was unimportant . I think it was the second time that affected me . I don 't remember what I was doing . Oh , yes , I was painting my nails , or some absurd thing like that . - Hello . - Good evening . - It 's strange . When I saw you earlier , sir ... - Don 't call me sir . When I saw you , Tristan , it made me sick . And when I see you now , I feel very , very well . Where is Cascade ? I tell you they 've been drinking . That isn 't normal . Why are you staring at me ? Maybe it 's time for you to know . Come and see . Come and see , will you ? Come ! You see , you 're not exactly up to date , honey . Don 't you think it 's time to let her know ? She must know that you visited next door , and you 'll never be the same again , ... so she 'll shed her oh-so-proper attitude . And it 's not just you . I went there too . Pierre planted something from next door in my womb . Some kind of madness . Oh , I forgot , you didn 't know . Pierre has been fucking me for a long time . Yes , he does fuck me . And he fucks Sala too . Princess Sala ! She takes him up the ass . Yes , my dear mama , in the ass . Several miles worth of cock . Isn 't it true , little Sala ? - Sala ? It 's not true , is it ? - Can 't you see they 're insane ? Come . You 'll stay at Grop 's house until our wedding . Everything will be alright . Grop isn 't home . The maid will let you in . Wait for me ! Tell me , Liberte was telling the truth , wasn 't she ? Our victory is imminent . How is it going with the mother ? It 's done . She 's with us . Shall I tell you , or shall I project ? Project . Let 's not use our repulsive physical voices . It wasn 't difficult . She already lived a parallel life . I put her in contact with her late husband . He was a hairdresser . Don 't fret . I was sure you would come . Give me my curling iron , Sausage ! You weren 't always nice to me . The seconds . All the seconds ! The billions of seconds of life ! Like ants ! In a huge anthill ! They bored into me , they devoured me . They get fat on me ! Darling ? Darling ? Do you still love me ? Let me see your face ! She 's done with love . - She 'll never be the same again ? - She 'll never be the woman she was . What became of the Cardinal ? And what about the rich man 's wife ? The Blanche woman . - Blanche ! - She 's on her way . That bitch ... Where is that fucking slut ? Their violence is a strange thing . They don 't know how to live in freedom . - No matter . He 's ours . - Yes , he 's ours . Oh , my God ! My God ! - Hello ? - It 's me . Blanche is gone . Yeah ? Well , she 's gone anyway . She must be at the cabaret . See that it 's raided . - But ... - No buts , little Werner . If you don 't see that the matter is settled tonight , don 't count on me tomorrow morning for your wedding . Understand ? Alright ! Tell the police not to pull their punches we don 't often have the opportunity to teach a lesson to those degenerates . See you tomorrow . I can 't do it . I can 't do it . They don 't receive me . I can 't sort out the sensations . Get a hold of yourself , Ingrid . We must go on . The black girl ? You got to her , didn 't you ? - Yes . I contacted her this morning . - Was it difficult ? The black one . The black girl . In the cabaret . Ruth ... Yes , that 's it , Ruth . I met her . In a big ... in a huge city . - Far away . It was 1950 . - That isn 't possible . You weren 't born . She needs me . She 's in danger . Images came back to me . Then other images blocked my sight . Oh , those uncalled on images ! Ruth ... Ruth ... Ruth ... You 're one of us now . It 's hard ! Help me , I 'm loosing her ... So what ? You succeeded . She 's ours . Don 't you understand ? I 'm not worried about our victory , but about my defeat . Can 't you see this world is changing us ? Diamant ! Help me ! Help me ! I 'm coming with you for the very last time . This is outrageous . Hey you ! Filthy flesh merchant ! While Ivan and Tristan are taking a stroll , ... Mayor Grop 's policemen are doing their job at the cabaret . - Up you go ! - Yes . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - Mayor Grop will be quite pleased ! - No ! You 're a funny sight , upside down . I like you . I like you too , little man . Who else among you feels pleasure in looking at their reflection in a mirror ? Strangely enough , I 've been feeling emotions that were unknown to me . Which ones ? Tell me . Must I ? Must I really , Diamant ? It is necessary . This is why we 're losing our power . Is this a new feeling for you ? To take these feelings away from them , that 's the very reason why we came here . It was shame , wasn 't it ? That 's what you felt ? Pride too , and you wanted to be loved . Is that why you did what you did ? - Yes . You knew ? - Here we know everything . And you know what we must do . No , please ! Oh shit ! What is it ? What happened ? Where 's the kid ? Oh , God , I 'll get him ! Ruth is all right . She 's gone to see the women in the villa down the road . - Who did this ? - Mister Grop . Here . Put this on . - Are you all right ? - Yes , I 'm better . Do you feel well enough for this ? Shall I show him in ? Yes . - Good morning , Werner . - Good morning , Ingrid . Don 't touch that . - This is an excellent reproduction . - No , it 's an original . That one is genuine . The one in the Prado is a copy . The same goes for the Mona Lisa , the painting in the Louvre is a forgery . For forty years , we 've been working on replacing your people 's valuables . I know . Yours is a formidable power . That 's why I 've been wondering , why are you unwilling to help me ? We have many contacts across this world , and many of them have already been exposed . We 're none the worse for it . I 'm not sure I can trust you , Werner . Look . I 'm on the verge of reaching my goal . I 've been fighting for you for ten years . You say you 're one of us , little Werner . I can see you 're still motivated by things which are utterly meaningless to us . To us , this power is nothing . If it leads to slavery , it 's nothing , just like money . For you , other people are rabble . You 're proving that you have no honor . None at all . You know nothing of the beauty of failure . You know nothing of the absurd . What gives you the right to speak to me like this ? Obviously , you 've never been humiliated . What do you know of my problems ? Nothing , that 's for sure . Nothing at all . You should take me too , while you 're at it . Why don 't you try it with me ? You took Pierre , after all . And the Bishop didn 't escape you . And Liberte through Pierre . And the Bishop 's housekeeper through the Bishop himself . What about me ? Take me ! Make me one of you , so I can be free your way . Werner , no ! Werner ... Werner ! Werner ! Stop it ! Werner , no ! Werner , no ! Please , Werner . Stay back . Stay back ! Stop ! Werner ! I know a lot about your activities here . And elsewhere too . Beware ! You 're very strong , but you 're not invulnerable . Remember that . Tell me ... What is love ? Love ? It 's a river in Russia . Stop ! Stop being stupid . Just stop it , alright ? If you don 't , I 'll punch you in the face . But I tell you , I loved her . Can 't you understand ? Why are you saying you loved her , when she 's all right ? She 's just over there ! Don 't do it , you fool ! Come on , hurry up ! Come on ! We 're going to ... hurry up ! Let 's go and see Ruth . Bastards ! Motherfuckers ! Bastards ... I 'll get them ! Come ! Oh , come ! Come ! So many still remain ! Their pleasures ! Their pleasures don 't take them anywhere . Gratification . Only gratification ... - This party is going to be our victory . - Yes , maybe . - What 's the matter with you now ? - Never mind . Pierre ? It looks like no one is coming to our wedding dinner . We 'll tell them the truth , of course , but that truth , but believe me , most of them won 't understand it . I 'm afraid they 'll think it 's absurd . Most of them have only ... only feelings , as they say . My duty was to report to my superiors . I 'm disappointed . I was told to forget about it . You don 't say ? You 're completely drunk , you poor fool . The Father is not drunk . You are , Grop . What the Father just said is true . Although it 's just part of the truth . I 'm going to tell you the rest . You uttered the word , love . Yes . Yes , I 'm becoming mortal again , since love makes one mortal , while at the same time giving life . Beware . You know I 'm prepared to do anything to save you . Can you promise you won 't touch Tristan ? This is why I told you that we would be able to pose as saviours in the public eye , just by exposing the case . If that were true , you wouldn 't frown like that . You would already be calling the press on the phone . Sir ! For ten years , I was an adept of those people . - What I just revealed ... - What game are you playing , Werner ? Come with me , M. Grop , and you 'll see that what I 'm telling you is true . How does your religion deal with people who sin ? - They are punished . - Yes ? How are they punished ? They 're flogged . Where 's the telephone ? It 's too early for that , M. Grop . Before you do that , I want to show you something . What ? Open the door , Werner ! Fuck me . Don 't mind him . - How 's it going , Gramps ? - How handsome he is in his tuxedo ! - Come here . - Yeah , I 'll making some room for you . Oh , Albert , don 't tell me you 're freaking out . In fact , I 'll bet that you 're really enjoying it . Aren 't you ? Oh , no , he 's really in pain . He can 't stand losing . Your pride is what 's hurting you , Albert . Your pride . My new friends have been showing me a lot of new things . Come join us ! It feels great . Come ... with us . Come ... Come ... Come ... Come ... I love you ! I love you ! I love you , little one . They were right . Everything is beautiful , it 's true . You are beautiful . Don 't say things like that . I 'm ugly as hell . No . Why do you say that ? If I were beautiful , would I still go to all the trouble I do now to make you love me ? Would you still love me ? Well ... she would give herself to him , and he would lose what he now calls his love . Before , I liked you . Now I really love you . I do love you . Come ! I 'll show you the images haunting the little man . You 'll never be a man of the past again . Never again . As long as no woman of our race is foolish enough to give herself to you . I told her everything . The truth . It 's true , I told her everything . Can 't you see that it 's killing me ? I need her now . I need Sala . And I must have the money . Not for me , of course , but for her . Because I love her . I do love her . I also want that swine , Grop . I was your ally once . Help me ! What 's the matter with you ? Gilda ! Come with me ! No , Diamant . I don 't want my former face back . You 've driven me insane , Ingrid ... I can 't draw anymore . I don 't know how to draw ! Mad Albert ... He 's gone quite crazy . - You 're free now . - You knew ? I suspected . I can feel it when I see you . So I 'm free ? But free to do what ? Free to live on a larger scale without that miserable love that deluded you into thinking you were living on a small one . To live ? What do you mean , to live ? I have been living ! In order to have lived , I had memories ! And from those memories I extracted things that allowed other people to live . - It was all fake . - Maybe it was . But what are you suggesting ? Maybe it was , there in your little confined world . But not here ! Not in this huge mess . Freedom ! I 'm not even free to love her ! And I want to love , do you hear me ? I can give you back what was taken from you . - How ? - I have to give myself to you . - What will happen to you ? - Nothing . See your friend Gilda ? She 's finding her former face again . Her real face . You 've lost , Ingrid , and you can feel it . You 've lost . I love him . No ! We came too early . First , it 's necessary to cure them . They are too seriously ill . Ingrid ! Farewell . How did she escape punishment under the law ? That is a privilege of the angels of the future . Adapted from original translation by goupil66

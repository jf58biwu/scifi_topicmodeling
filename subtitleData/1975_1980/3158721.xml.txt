 Moonbase Alpha status report , 342 days after leaving Earth orbit . Dr Helena Russell recording . We have just survived our second encounter with a space warp . We 've been catapulted six light years from our previous position . We 've had no casualties this time . Our population remains stable at 297 . However , one life support system was severely damaged . We have a survey Eagle reconnoitring a nearby planet in an attempt to locate titanium , needed to repair that life support system . Entering the atmosphere now , Commander . Thank you . Atmosphere breathable . We 're in close visual contact with the planet . - Fraser , any signs of life ? - No settlements , no life . Nothing , Commander , except volcanoes . Fraser , scan for mineral compositions . Scanner active . Stand by to log into main computer . Dr Russell ! Titanium ! - Eagle One , return to base . - Right , Commander . Picard , pinpoint the location of the titanium deposits . Magnify ! Fraser ! There 's a strange light coming ! - Position ? - It 's on your flight path . Get out of there ! - What is that ? - An energy weapon . Security alert ! All crews to position . Rescue Eagles , full alert ! Laser crews to position 1-5 . Evasive action , Fraser ! Evasive action ! Can 't shake it , Alpha . Come on , Fraser ! Come on ! Get it off your tail ! We 're trying ! We 're trying ! Do something , Alpha , for God 's sake ! - Bill ! - Help us , Alpha ! Help us ! For God 's sake , help us , Alpha ! Medical crew , Command Centre . Laser battery one , active . Combat Eagle Five in position . Combat Eagle Six in position . There 's got to be life on that planet . There is no life sign on the surface . - What about below it ? - That is an environmental hell . No life could exist there . Commander Koenig . You know who I am . Who are you ? - I am Mentor of the planet Psychon . - Why did you attack our ship ? We came in peace . You sent an armed ship to talk of peace ? That ship was a survey vessel . We had no way of knowing your planet was inhabited . This argument has caused the death of millions of our people . Other outsiders have used it to attack before . Easy now , easy . Come on now , come on . Your pilots are safe , but their Eagle is beyond repair . - He said they 're safe ! - Return my men ... Annie , Bill 's alive ! Yes , Commander . You have my solemn pledge that no hostile action will be taken . I accept your pledge . So , let us arrange their return . Send another Eagle and I 'll instruct you where to land . No ... I 'm afraid that could cause further misunderstanding . I suggest we rendezvous , but in space . It seems you trust us as little as we trust you . In our past , we 've been betrayed , too . Let us meet in space , then . You say that you need minerals . Send along a scientific officer to discuss technical requirements and ... you shall have them . - That 's very generous . Thank you . Incidentally , one pilot suffered minor injuries . Perhaps you could also send along a medical officer . - It will be done . - I look forward to meeting you . Mentor . Alan , put Eagle Four on the pad ready for immediate lift-off . And , Alan ... equip it with additional booster units . Right . Booster units ? You 're in a hurry to get out there , aren 't you ? I may be in a hurry to get back . What do you think of these Alphans , Maya ? I like them , Father . They 're very attractive , quite unlike the others . Their culture is similar to our own , but not so advanced . - Would I make a good Alphan , Father ? - Stop it , Maya ! I teach you molecular transformation and you use it for foolish games ! Father ! You only taught me because you knew I 'd master it myself . True , but we must find a better outlet for your gifts . I 'd help in your work . No , a great deal about the work I do you do not understand yet . - Father ... - Not yet . Will the Alphans help you to restore our planet ? Yes , Maya . And now , my dear , run along . Prepare the Alphan pilots . - Where do you think you 're going ? - Back to my station . She needs to rest . - You think you can handle it ? - I feel much better now . Maybe it is better to keep busy . Don 't overdo it , all right ? I won 't . - Are you all right ? - Yes , Commander . - We 'll bring him back . - Thank you . Good luck . They come , Maya , They are men of honour . We 're in position , John . Mentor , this is John Koenig . We 're at rendezvous point . My ship will join you shortly , Commander . There it is . I want a full scan on that ship . Mentor , signal when you 're ready for link-up . I repeat , signal when you 're ready to dock . John : There are no life forms on that ship ! Fraser , Torens , they 're not on it ! The ship is empty ! We 're picking up magnetic disturbance , Tony . - We 're losing altitude . - His ship is radiating energy . It 's like a magnet , he 's pulling you down . Full power ! Full power , Commander ! We 're still held ! Boosters , half thrust ! Three-quarter power ! She won 't take it ! She 'll break up ! Boosters , full power ! We 're clear , Tony . Returning to base . John ! That ship is turning into a ball of light ! No response . It 's like a graveyard of spaceships . And we 're right in the middle of it . Eagle Four to Moonbase Alpha . Come in , Alpha . Do you read me ? Eagle Four to Moonbase ... I can 't raise them . - Keep trying . - Welcome to Psychon . Don 't be alarmed , Commander . I 'm never alarmed by a man of integrity . I see that you are angry , but , please , bear with me , and you will understand . L 'll understand after I see my people ! - I act in both our interests . - He 's lying ! Commander , we 're being am ... Please forgive the interruption . Your pilot is in a feverish state . - Then I want to examine him ! - You will , Doctor , in good time . Now , please , remain in your ship until we contact you . Let 's go . Let 's make for that cave . Keep on scanning , Sandra . They 're down there somewhere . I know they are but all we get is the planet surface . Our beam is bouncing off a scanner shield of some kind . We won 't read anything they don 't want us to read . Is she gonna be all right ? - As long as she knows he is alive . I 'm worried she 's gonna crack up . Be patient with her , Tony . They 've been married two months . Yeah . Ah , Maya ! Observe . An increase in Psyche 's power levels ! One of the pilots has been in rapport with her . This is the result . He agreed ? No harmful side effects ? - None . - But that 's wonderful , Father ! Will the rest of them help us ? - Yes , they are intelligent people . - Lew , titanium ? - Yes , it is . A few more hunks like this is all we need . - Diverse life forms . - They must be from those spaceships out there . The way they ... move . The way they look . They 're all behaving in the same way . It must be some sort of brain damage . Now we know what Mentor meant by " Welcome " . Torens ! He doesn 't know us . - John ! - You OK ? - John ... - Are you OK ? - It was a forcefield . That charge was only set to stun . Molecular transformation . We saw it in the spaceship and the balls of light . Surrender your weapons , Commander . There is an energy screen around this image . You cannot get through . Lew , how can we get past it ? It is only a communications circuit . Laser energy might overload it . I warn you , any force will be turned against you . - I think I can neutralise it . - Lew ! Wait ! Commander , to resist is foolish . Helena ! Very well . - Did I startle you , Commander ? - Wasn 't that the idea ? Oh , forgive me . I meant no harm . Psychons are full of fun and games . Who are you ? - Maya , Mentor 's daughter . - His daughter ? And just as tricky . - I should have warned you about the forcefield . - Of course . Where 's the rest of my party ? - Why are you so unfriendly ? I 've been lied to , assaulted , seen my people brutalised , killed ! Shall I go on ? - You have not fully recovered . - Mentor betrayed us ! Viciously destroyed ... - My father would harm no one ! Come . He wants to see you . Relax , Commander . Your friends are inside . Come in , Commander ! Not now , my dear . We have vital business to discuss . He is very unhappy . I want to hear you explain . Don 't worry , he 'll understand . Psyche , Commander , a biological computer , created from the minds and bodies of those of our people who survived the disaster which overwhelmed us . - Mentor , where are my people ? - Study Psyche first , Commander . Our destinies are linked . - We 'll determine our own destinies . This planet is a volcanic furnace , but through Psyche I shall transform it , change it back to the beautiful world it once was . A world fit enough for our civilisation to begin again . A beautiful dream . We 'll talk more about it after I see my people . Commander , Psyche needs energy to complete its task . Energy that is only found in the minds of intelligent life forms . In other words , Commander , the machine needs your Alphans . Those creatures in the pits , Torens ... You fed their minds into that machine ? There is no other energy source . I also need them to dig the metal for Psyche 's physical being . You expect me to submit my people to this ... obscenity ? ! Your presence here in space has given me a chance , perhaps my only chance , to make my world live again . And regretfully you have no choice . You must submit . Psyche has the power of molecular transformation , the power to transform matter into any form or shape I choose . Observe your lunar landscape . - Weapons Section . - Energy charge in the research area . Send a unit to investigate . - Yes , sir . Refuse what I ask and I shall reduce your moon to ashes . You 're right . We can 't fight you . Thank you for your co-operation . No , you 're not reading me . Go ahead - destroy the moon . - Bring down death on your people ? - At least they 'll die quickly . - I have the power and the will . - Destroy us and you defeat yourself . No moon , no Alphans . Do what I ask and you and your friends will be spared . A place will be found for you on the new Psychon . - No . You wish to know about the rest of your party ? In a few moments , their minds will be squeezed dry and Psyche shall have them . There 's still time , Commander . Wait ! Yes , Commander ? You win . Tony ! It 's coming from the planet ! Punch it up . John ! We 'd given you up ! Commander , what 's happening ? Tony , good news , we 've made contact with the people . There are huge habitable subterranean areas . What 's more , we have permission to settle . Evacuate Alpha as soon as possible . - Evacuate ? ! - Ship our people down in relays . - He 's selling out ! - It can 't be . Mentor 's done something to him . - No study , no research ? Just pack up and go down ? - Why aren 't we going ? - Well , it is unusual procedure . - Directive Four . It empowers the Commander to act in a situation like this . You will do as ordered . The procedure is laid down . Signal when you are ready . Out . Thank you , Koenig . Commander ! It was the only way out . You should be grateful . You owe him your lives . - The price is too high . - Our survival ! John , what about the people on Alpha ? You could end up like those creatures in the caves , but not me ! John ? Computer is refusing access . I will need the security code . I know what Directive Four is . Well , at least somebody is happy . What is Directive Four ? It 's a coded signal to destroy the place it originated from . - Destroy the planet ? - It 's mandatory . And you will carry it out ? ! Return to your position . We 've got to warn Alpha ! - There 's no way out . - You mean we just do nothing ? We 're trapped in here . Robot Eagle ready to launch . Estimated time of arrival at attack position , 152O . - Attack position ? - Maximum destructive power . When that Eagle hits Psychon there will be nothing left . - What are you doing ? ! - Obeying orders . Bill 's still down there ! So is the Commander and the rest of them . - You 're going to destroy the planet ? - Directive Four cannot be ignored . - What is Directive Four ? - Can 't we double-check ? Ask for clarification ? John wouldn 't give that order unless this base faced destruction ! Launch Robot Eagle . - No , no ! In ten minutes , it 'll be all over . Commander , one of your Eagles is on its way . I want to assure you that you and your friends will not be harmed . Maya , if you would scan that Eagle . No life forms ! It is a robot device programmed to destroy Psychon . How primitive ! How disgusting that the Commander should descend to such deception ! - Don 't confront him yet . Let him think he has deceived us . I don 't have your tolerance . Now who is the betrayer , Commander ? Did you think that your childish trick would go undetected ? We live in hope . Sending a probe to destroy this planet ! You 're a self-sacrificing fool ! I 'm sorry . I just couldn 't take the chance of telling you . First , I shall destroy your Eagle . Then your moon , Commander . Mentor ... that way we both lose . Let 's negotiate . Negotiate ? With a liar ? You disgust me ! We welcome you as friends and you plot to kill us ! - You expect us to be destroyed ? - My father is an honourable man . - Why does he want us ? - You know why ! Others helped us . - Yes , and what happened to them ? They attained happiness , Psyche benefits everyone . Maya , that machine destroys minds ! Is there no vile thing you won 't say against my father ? - Go down to the caves and see . - They 're radioactive . - Who says ? Mentor ? - There 's nobody down there . Maya , we 've been there ! Go and see what we 've seen . Mindless hulks , destroyed by your father ! That 's not true ! Go ! Then come back and let us out so we can stop him ! - No ... - Please ! Go and see ! - You 're lying ! - Go and see ! You 're lying ! Weapons Section . We might be attacked . Activate shields . - Yes , sir . Commander . Koenig ! Alpha will be destroyed , and you caused it ! - We 've got to make a deal . - We can 't stop him unless we get out of here ! We 've got to break that forcefield ! Commander ? - What 's happening ? - They 're through our shields . - What was it ? - An energy bolt of enormous power ! - Launch Eagles for full attack . - I don 't think it 'll help . No , neither do I. Maya , release the forcefield . He 's gonna destroy 3OO more people ! Promise that Mentor will not be harmed . I want to stop him , not harm him . Alan , get to the Eagle . Prepare for lift-off . Helena , you and Fraser get Torens . Let 's go . Maya ! What are you doing ? No , Commander ! To release Psyche 's energy will destroy the whole planet ! Stop it , Commander ! This is madness ! Maya , you must stop him ! - I was in the pits ! - Get her away ! - You said he wouldn 't be harmed ! - Take her ! - Mentor , come on ! Get Maya away ! Take her away ! Save yourselves ! - Come with us , Father ! Leave Psyche ! Psyche made you do evil ! Understand , Maya ! I wanted to do good , I wanted to restore our planet ! I didn 't want to hurt anyone ! Hold her , Koenig ! Hold onto her ! No , Maya ! - Take her away , Koenig ! - Maya , you can 't help him ! We 've got to get out of here ! Maya ! Get her out , Commander ! Come on . Come on ! Hurry ! Go ! Get moving ! Fraser ! Raise Eagle Four . - Eagle Four from Alpha . Eagle Four - Go ahead , Alpha . Fraser ... I 've got something for you . We 'll soon be back on Alpha . In time you 'll forget . It 's just hard to stop thinking about Picard and Torens . I know . Thank you , Maya . Thank you for saving our lives . - And losing mine . - You 'll have a new life with us . Your science is so far ahead of ours . There 's a place for you on Alpha . Everywhere but on Psychon , I 'll be an alien . We 're all aliens , until we get to know one another .

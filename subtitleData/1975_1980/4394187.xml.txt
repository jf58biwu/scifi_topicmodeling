So in the name of God ... who are you ? Who are you ? You ... I am from the other side . What ? The down platform . My candle . - Do you know what you 've done ? - Yes . You 've blown it out during an important psychical investigation . - Have I ? - Yes , and that could be dangerous . Mind the thread there . There 's another one there ! - I 'd appreciate an explanation . - For what ? - Breaking in here and ... - You own this place , do you ? No , but I 'm conducting an investigation ... - So am I. - What ? Conducting an investigation . A serious one . You better pack up your junk and leave . When I was here first ? Oh , no ! 'Steel . ' I 've been observing here for nearly two months . - ' Yes ? ' - ' Anything on the footbridge ? ' - ' No . Where are you ? ' - ' The platform . Your side . 'I think you better come here - now . ' It 's my ghost , you know . I located it first . - Have you seen it ? - No , but I 've heard it . I 've been observing here for two months , that gives me every right ... You have no rights . Not in this . You see , it happens to be more than just a ghost . Now what ? - The time of year now ? - Late October . Why ? - Not here . Not on this platform . - What ? It 's summer . - Summer ? - Yes . Can you feel it ? It 's a summer night . Can you feel the warmth ? - No . - And the air . It 's filled with the smell of flowers . And trees - the movement of them . And the smell of newly-cut grass . - What time period ? - I don 't know . And the source ? I can 't tell . It 's just that ... it doesn 't seem malevolent . The sensation of warmth and calmness . It is malevolent . It has to be . Sapphire , there are no trees , there are no flowers . There 's only you and I , it ... and a man . It 's not locked . - Who is the man ? - Some would-be ghost catcher . He 's in the booking hall trying to make contact with what he thinks is a lost soul . - Does it feel like summer in here ? - No . - This man ... - What 's in there ? What 's in there ? - It leads to the reception area . - Reception area ? This wasn 't just a station . There was once a hotel attached to it . A railway hotel . How romantic . " 1947 . " They still had steam engines in those days . - Why a derelict station ? - I don 't know . Why this place ? It 's hardly what we expected . It depends what it has in mind , what form it 's taken . - Or whose form it 's taken . - Yes . Landing . Hotel bedrooms . There are two more floors like this . - How many rooms are there in all ? - About 20 . It doesn 't seem to have taken up residence in any of them . You expect it to arrive with a suitcase , do you ? No . Steel . Something 's happening in here - a change . Stay there . Watch me . - What am I looking at ? - It happened just now , twice . - My clothes and my hair changed . - Into what ? It was a light cotton shirt ... and a straw hat . - Summer clothes ? - Yes . Summer clothes - I don 't see them . You smell summer - I don 't . - From here ? - Yes . - No ? - No . Well , it seems to be interested in you , whatever it is . - What did it look like to you ? - Human . - Male or female ? - I couldn 't tell . Steel . They 're real , they exist . The soil 's fresh . It 's been newly dug . Chrysanthemum compositae , geraniaceae , caryophyllaceae ... Summer flowers at full bloom . - Late October . - Yes . - The man in the booking hall . - What about him ? - Does he exist ? - He 's in there . But is he real ? You said it could take any form . - Did you do a spot analysis ? - You know that 's not my territory . It is mine , though . Are you playing tricks with me ? - Tricks ? - Yes . Tricks with flowers . I happen to be a psychical investigator , not a conjuror . - So , you 've seen the flowers ? - I 've seen some flowers , yes . On the platform ? Well , I shouldn 't worry , they won 't be there long - they never are . Even if you took some home , they 'd still disappear later . I 've tried it . - And what about you ? - Me ? Are you likely to disappear later ? I shouldn 't think so , no . If I didn 't make these notes straight ... - How do you do ? - How do you do ? My name is Sapphire . Oh . - And your name is ? - Tully . George Tully . Well , I 'm so very pleased to meet you , Mr Tully . 'Muscular power emission , 'mass times acceleration times distance divided by time ... ' Pleased to meet you . I suppose my friend didn 't introduce himself . ' ... by its power of contraction enables movement to be made . ' - I always have to apologise for him . - Do you ? Oh . 'Voluntary muscle existing mainly for movement of the skeleton . ' - He thought you might be a ghost ! - I thought he was one ! 'Blood circulating throughout the body 'carrying nutrients and oxygen to the tissues . ' You don 't look like a ghost to me . Oh , I 'm not . Flesh and blood like everyone else , I 'm afraid . 'Blood has four main constituents - plasma , erythrocytes ... ' - ' In other words , human . ' - ' Yes . 'Life expectancy of present subject ... 57.03 years . ' This ghost of yours ... Mr Tully ? - Yes ? - Describe it to me . What ? I 'm glad you asked that question but it 's not really my ghost . " It 's my ghost , I located it first . " Describe it to me . - That woman , is she ... - What ? Is she a relative or just a friend ? - A business associate . - Ah . Business . Yes , I understand . - Mr Tully ... - I always work alone , myself . Not that I prefer it that way but it 's difficult to find someone compatible , someone ... Business associate ? A kind of darkness . Like a piece of darkness , not quite a shadow . Yes , like a piece of darkness . - And that 's all you 've seen ? - Well , it 's enough . I 'm a patient observer . - Two months . - What ? You 've been observing this presence for two months . Approximately , yes . - Been with you long ? - What ? - Your business associate . - Quite a long time , yes . - Good working relationship ? - Perfect . That 's a godsend these days ... How long has it been haunting this place ? As far as I know , just those two months . From the time I found it . And I regard that as an important private and personal discovery . - So , what 's your interest ? - I 'm here to get rid of it . But making contact with that ghost , as I have done , is essential . - Not to me . - It 's necessary . It 's of supreme importance both to psychical and theological groups ... You won 't get rid of it , you can 't . - It is not just a ghost . - Thank you . What else can it be ? Whatever it is ... it represents a kind of energy . - What kind of energy ? - Negative energy . Cranks like you could never understand it . You only increase the danger . By trying to help ? By interfering . - You 're still in the Dark Ages . - Am I ? Well , at least in my ignorance I 'm sympathetic . At least I know he 's in trouble ... and he 's been hurt in some way . That he needs help . He ? I just feel that it 's a man , the ghost of a man . Why ? It 's just that ... Well , I sense it , I suppose . I accept that it 's a man . I haven 't seen him but ... I just know . And then there 's the sounds . What sounds ? Of the things he carries . Heavy sounds . Well , not all that heavy but it 's as if ... As if he were carrying bulky objects - bags , luggage . That 's why I feel he was a traveller or a member of the station staff . I feel ... I feel he cares about this place . He has a ... weird kind of interest in the place , yes . No , he cares . Someone who provides flowers , has the power to decorate that platform with flowers , how could he represent danger or evil ? - When will you be back ? - Tomorrow . - At what time ? - ' Steel ! ' - To continue my investigation ... - Keep quiet . - Pardon ? - ' What is it ? ' 'It 's the platform again . Something ... changing . 'Something happening 'The flowers have appeared again and the smell of summer 'but there 's something else , Steel , something else this time . ' 'Can you identify it ? ' 'Just ... a very powerful feeling ... of hatred . 'And resentment , a strong feeling of resentment . 'The whole atmosphere out here is charged with it . 'And that sound , Steel . ' 'Can you hear that ? ' 'No . What is it ? ' 'It 's the sound of a band . It 's approaching . ' 'It 's coming here . ' Listen . 'And I can hear men ... marching . ' Do you hear that ? - ' Be careful , Sapphire . ' - You hear it ? - ' Sapphire , be careful . ' - ' I 'm all right , Steel . ' - # What 's the use of worrying ... # - ' Sapphire , leave that platform now . 'We 're in the waiting room . Come here now . '

 We can 't live on daffodils . Or we could try . We could try anything . Proper food . I 'll go into the town . No . No , you won 't . There 'll be something in the houses there . Yes , with cholera and typhoid . You won 't go into town . Listen to me , Wendy . We have lasted so long . Have you ... Have you tried the house I see from my room ? I 've been round all the houses twice . So much life . Everything is living . Why can 't we ? - I 'm going . - No , no , wait ! We shall have ... We shall have more nettles and dandelions for soup . We shall live another day . I need food ! But you can 't walk to town . I walked here . Yes , but you were strong then . If I find anything , I 'll stop and come back . Find anything . Anything . And , look , take this . It may be raining . Wendy , if you could throw a stone at some of those birds , not a crow , a pigeon , a fat pigeon . I 'll try again . I 'll go through the wood . There might be something . Oh , I know I am no use , no use at all . Wendy , you will come back ? Yeah , I 'll come back . I ... I need you . I need you . It was nice of her . That 's much better . You know you 're supposed to talk politics while you trim , don 't you ? Tomorrow we 're going to wash everyone 's hair . - Why ? - So that the bugs don 't get in . And you 're next for a haircut , young man . Hey , are you two ready ? - Well , how do I look ? - Funny ! - Funny ? - No , you don 't . - Shall I pay her ? - Yes . You 've all been much nicer than usual . We 've come to a decision . The grown-ups had a long talk last night , and we 've decided that I 'm not going to look for Peter any more . That 's why I ditched the Land Rover . Instead , we 're going to find somewhere to live . - A house ? - Or a farm . - Castle ? - Maybe . Yeah , but somewhere safe , where you can grow food , keep animals . And hens , for eggs . And cows and sheep and pigs . And we 'll gather more people and more children . Maybe Peter 'll come . Maybe . JOHN : Can we ... Can we have eggs today ? No , just rabbits . Rabbit again ? Hadn 't we better fill up ? GREG : No , we 're all right for a bit . Why fill up before we need to ? JOHN : And cabbage , too , I suppose . GREG : No , we 're out of cabbage . You 're going to be sorry you left that cabbage field . I shan 't . Rabbit and cabbage . Rabbit and cabbage . CHILDREN : Rabbit and cabbage . Rabbit and cabbage ! Rabbit and cabbage ! Be quiet ! Come on , tiddlers . Come to papa . Oh , you beauty . You beauty . Come here , man ! Come back , man ! Who 's that , now then ? Do you want a bit of fish , do you ? Uh , I 've got some here . Oh , a girl , is it ? Had the disease , have you ? Yeah . I got better . Yes , well , I can see that , can 't I ? But , uh , you don 't mind me fishing here , do you ? - You caught anything ? - Have I ? Look , man . I was after a big one , like that . You scared him off . He was that size . Sorry . Well , what ... What 's your name ? Wendy . Oh , aye ? On your own , are you ? Yeah . I 'm with an old woman . Hmm . You catching some more ? Oh , I might . I might . Want some ? Yeah , I 'm starving . Mmm . Well , now , you see , I 'm a kind of merchant , see . I ... I get things for people , what they want . Then they give me what I want , see . I 've got a van , over there . Yes , I saw . You , you , uh ... You want me to catch some more fish ? I need to go back . Look , that old lady , now , where does she live ? Oh , about a mile , in a cottage . Oh , over there ! You , uh ... What will you give me for them ? Well , then ? I 'll walk farther on . No , I tell you , now , I 'll give you them . Because I 'm a kind man , see . I 'm kind-hearted . And we 'll be kind to each other , shall we ? I tell you what , I got a good idea . I 'll build a fire , and then I 'll cook these and you can have one , and I 'll have the other , hmm ? ( DOGS BARKING ) Those dogs , they 'll be starving , too . A change of plan . Here , you take this , and we 'll gather all this stuff up , see , and then we 'll go to the van . Come on ! Come on , quick ! Come on , to the van ! Hurry up ! Well , you 'll have to be quick ! Take me back , please . GREG : I 'll just have to drive through them . - No ! - Where are you going ? - Where do you think ? To get rid of them . - Abby , get back . They may be rabid . - Rabies ? - Yeah , yeah . Just look . Oh , no , not in this country . Not with the quarantine regulations . What quarantine regulations ? I mean , how many hundreds , thousands , have got away from ports or airports ? LIZZIE : What 's rabies ? It 's a disease that the dogs might have . Just one bite , even a small scratch , well , there 's no cure on Earth . ABBY : Jenny , give me the gun . Look , Abby , we 've only got five cartridges left . Well , then drive through them . Okay , kids , get your heads down . Don 't look . GREG : You ready ? JENNY : Yes . ( BARKING ) Well , they must have heard . It 's all right , kids , they 've gone . There must be something along the road . Something tastier than us . - Hey , Ben ! - ALL : Ben ! Ben ! - Ben ! - Ben ! Oh , he 's gone off with his friends . JOHN : He 'll be killed ! You know , there could be sheep up there . Well , if we follow , we might be able to get one . - And Ben . - It 's risky . Oh , well , anyway , who wants roast lamb ? CHILDREN : Me ! ( DOGS BARKING ) ( SCREAMING ) Oh dear , an old woman ! JENNY : Abby ! Abby ! GREG : Yeah , look , Abby , get back ! I 'm going to get up there , you draw them off ! ( CRYING ) - Dogs ! - GREG : Here , boy , come on ! - Come on ! Here , boy ! - Come on ! JENNY : Come on ! ( GASPING ) Drive on ! Go on ! Good boy . Drive ! Go on ! Go on , dogs ! ( PANTING ) ( HOOTING ) Are you all right ? Yes . Were you bitten ? Do you understand me ? Uh , yes . Bitten ? No , I don 't think so . Good . Now , let 's get you inside . Are you alone ? Oh , Wendy ... Wendy , she 's out there . I heard the dogs and I came to call her . Yes , well , you can tell me all about it . Come on , let 's get you inside . My friends 'll be back very soon . - Friends ? - Yes , in the bus . Come on . That 's all right , come on . Crazy Abby . Hmm , braver than me . Oh , yeah , me , too . Now how do we get back to her ? We 'll have to find a side road and circle round . - Could you get the map ? - Mmm . What about Ben ? He 's lost . Oh , well , never mind , he 'll be happier with his new friends . - Now ... - Now , where are we ? Uh , there , look . No , no , no , we 're up further , there . Oh , well , there 's a river . Did we come by a river ? Are we lost ? No , no , no . There 's a big house . Can we get to that ? Well , we can try . Can you tell me where to turn off this road ? Yes . ( DOGS BARKING ) What sort of a woman is she , then ? Funny . She goes on about the past , about her sons and her grandchildren , when she was a young mum . Sounds boring for you . Well , she goes on a bit . Well , look , I tell you now , forget her . You ... You know I said I deliver things for people ? Well , people pay me for delivering , see ? So I 'm a rich man . Very rich . I 've got my own place and it 's a lovely place . So stay with me . I 've got to go back . Why ? You know , you ... You could be like a princess . I 'll get some more wood . I bet you 're hungry , aren 't you ? Well , it won 't be two ticks now . You should see all the food I 've got in my place , man . Turkeys and chickens and hams and apples . And you 're a pretty little girl . You know that , don 't you ? You ... Gone ! She stole my fish ! Hey ! Hey ! You come back here ! She 'll go back to that old woman . She lives in the cottage down the road . That girl , boy , she 's no Red Riding Hood . Ah ... Ben ? ABBY : Are you feeling better ? Yes . It could have been worse , you know . It 's a pity . What is ? That it wasn 't worse . You know , you 're the first person I 've seen for three months , apart from Wendy . I should have gone with the others . What others ? My whole family . My sons , the children . Are you thirsty ? Yes . Hungry and thirsty . There 's boiled water over there . Did you live here ? It was my son 's cottage . He was a surveyor . And this was their weekend cottage . Oh , thank you . ( GASPS ) You see , he ... He brought me over here to make it ready for them . They were all coming , to escape the fever . But there was no escape . I had a phone call from a neighbour of my son in town to tell me that ... They ... They all ... And ... And then the neighbours here . And then Wendy came walking and she told me that everybody was dead . She 's such a nice girl . She stayed with me . We are together now . What do you live on ? Well , we went to other people 's houses . There aren 't too many here , but Wendy went further , but they are all empty now . And then we ... We have eaten from the gardens , and the dandelion soup and nettle soup , and dandelion soup again . ( LAUGHING ) Wendy 's out with the basket now . I 've got a gun . I 'm going to go out and shoot something for food . You could put a bullet in me , if I would be tender enough . ( CHUCKLES ) I don 't think you would be . ( CHUCKLES ) What 's your name ? - Abby . - Abby . - Are you married ? - Yes . - Any children ? - A son . Um , my name is Emma , Emma Cohen . Wendy calls me Mrs Cohen . She 's very young . Yes . And you are alive , Mrs Cohen . Yes , I am alive . Hmm . You know , if I had been savaged by dogs , like I was before the fever , I would have died of fright . I used to be frightened of everything in my life , one thing or another , but now , since the worst has happened to everybody , I 'm not frightened any more . Yes , well , you have a sleep , and I 'll go and get my gun . ( SIGHS ) Put your hands up , missus ! Now back against the wall ! Go on ! There you are ! Have you got a pistol ? - No . - Ah . Now , who 's inside the cottage ? An old woman . - Has she got a gun ? - No . Oh , well , now , move away from the window . Go on . Now then . Now , one false move and I 'll blow you up , so careful . What 's the matter with her ? She was attacked by dogs . Oh , yes , we heard them . We ? Me . Me , I heard them . You 're on your own ? Yes , yes , you might say that . - Tom Price ! - Aye ? - You deserted us , didn 't you ? - Did I ? You went over to Wormley and his thugs . - Abby Grant ! - Right . Can I put my hands down now ? Oh , yes , yes , but , uh , careful , see . Have you seen anything of Wormley and his thugs ? No . Have you ? No , no . What are you doing here , then ? - Just passing . - Oh , aye . So , you 've left the gang , have you ? I 'm no gangster , see . I 'm a merchant now . I ... I get things for people , and people give me things in gratitude . Is there anything I can get for you or the old woman ? Food . Oh , food , is it ? Yes . Yeah , I can supply that . We 're very hungry . Yes , you look hungry . What 's in the van , Tom ? Well , what 's in the van is mine , see , and I give it out very , very carefully . - Tom . - Aye ? - Tom , there 's a pigeon over there . - Maybe there is . Well , there is . Why don 't you go over and get it ? Because you 'll play some tricks . Oh , no , I wouldn 't . Look , do you want me to come with you for the pigeon ? I might . Or the old woman , in case she plays some tricks , too ? Look , Tom , we 're hungry . Look , why don 't I get into the van and drive off and leave you ? Because you need me . You 're no good on your own . I ... I ... I 'm all right . 12 bore . I 've got some more cartridges in the van . Uh , tell me , now what do I get if I bring you a pigeon ? Company . Aye , well , I want more than that , see . I 'm hungry . I 'm hungry . I 'm starving , Mummy . So are we all . If I only had the gun ... I want something to eat , Mummy . Don 't call me Mummy . BOTH : Mummy , Mummy , Mummy , Mummy , Mummy , Mummy , Mummy ... GREG : Now , shut up , kids . Let 's see what I can do with this . Greg , please ! It 's not ... One dog is bound to get you first . Greg ! ( GROWLS ) There 's just enough cocoa for two cups . Can I light the stove in here ? That 's Abby . Got one ! But Abby only had two cartridges . So , who 's shooting ? And where is Abby ? Oh , you 're up and about , then ? Is that Mr Price ? Yeah , well , I told you , didn 't I , see ? I told you I 'd get one . Well , it 's not much for three of us . But I will make it into soup . The fire is on . Hey , steady on . Why should I give it up ? What are you going to pay me ? Pay you ? Tom was hoping that I 'd give him some favours in return for food . You dare ! I dare , missus . Of course I dare . A favour , she said . So you can pay up , or else I 'll be off . Oh , no , don 't go , Tom . I don 't see anything wrong with it either . I mean , fair deal . Eh ? You mean ... You mean ... You mean , it 'll be all right ? Yes . Well , you 're a lonely man , Tom . I don 't trust her , see ... It 's because you 're on your own , Tom . Pluck it ! Go on ! But ... Go on , missus , get on with it . I 'll tell you , you 're not going to get many favours for that . Am I not ? You 'll have to do better than that . ( STAMMERING ) I 've got some more stuff in the van , beans and pickles . Oh , Tom ! Beans and pickles ? Yes ! I 'll go and get them now . Hey , now , no , stop there , now . I said I didn 't trust you . - Sorry , Tom . - Now , get back over there . Over there , quick ! Don 't move , now , now ... I 'm watching you now . Yes . And don 't forget , I 'm watching you . I 'm thinking of the favours , Tom . Yes ... Yes , well , so am I. Just stay there , now . Don 't you move a muscle . Hey ! Hey , who did that ? Answer me , or I 'll blow your bleeding head off , I will . Ah , open this door ! ( BANGING ) - Open this door or ... - Tom Price ! If you try to blow yourself out of there you 'll fill yourself full of shot . If I get out of here , you 'll all be dead within one minute ! Now , open the door ! Open ... Open this door ! I 'll give you till I count 10 to open the door ! And I won 't do anything , now , I give you my word . I won 't touch you . I promise , now . Till I count ten . One , two , three ... - EMMA : Wendy ! - ... four ... Wendy ! Oh ! ... eight ... We are rich . Yes , we are rich ! Now I 'm coming after you . Now you 've asked for it . - Jenny ? - What ? I think they 've gone . I think the dogs have gone . ( WHISTLING ) Lizzie ? John ? You can come on out now . It 's safe . - Come on , kids . - JENNY : Come on . JOHN : Have they gone ? JENNY : Yes , they 've gone . Oh , well , I just hope there 's some food in here . JENNY : Come on , don 't look now , just keep walking . One , two ! One , two ! Are you all right ? Are you going to be all right ? Jenny ? - Would you put the headlamps on ? - Is it safe ? Well , I just need to see all I can . Okay . That 's it , thank you ! And now would you put some petrol in it ? I 'm just going to go and have a look around . What 's Daddy doing ? I don 't know . He isn 't Daddy , is he ? Well , there 's no sign of them . I hope they light a fire soon and we see the smoke . ( BANGING ) TOM : Are you there ? Hey , what ... What time is it ? You ... You can let me out now . I 'm a dying man . I 'm dying in here . Hello ? Please ... It 's morning . TOM : Oh , you ! ( BANGING ) Are you deaf ? Open this door ! Tom Price , if you don 't stop that , we 'll light a fire under you ! Oh ... Oh , no . No ! No , don 't do that ! Don 't do ... For God 's sake , don 't do that , whatever you do ! Don 't do that , you hear ? I wonder what 's in those boxes . Greg ? Greg ? Here ! I 'm in here ! A kitchen . Well , one of them . There 's no food . Just some salt . Oh , it 's damp . What a peculiar place . Yeah , but it 's shelter . But this room 's different from all the rest . Yeah , I think someone did some modernising . There 's something there that doesn 't need gas or electricity . Ooh ! - There 's some anthracite . - There 's a big pile of it outside . But we can 't light the fire , not during the day , anyway , just in case it attracts whoever was doing the shooting . No fire . Oh , come on , we don 't need a fire to survive . Just got to play safe . Oh , what a dump . No , no , no , no , could be worse . There 's a big tank of oil outside , probably used as central heating , whole lot of paraffin . Whoever lived here only used a few of the rooms . The rest of the place is absolutely empty . Oh , well . The children are still asleep . Well , that 's good . The longer , the better . I can 't bear them being so hungry . Right , well , you put your boots on , and we 'll go and see what we can find to eat , all right ? Mmm . And the garden 's around here . It 's walled in , pretty overgrown , still , we might find something . - LIZZIE : Where are you ? - They 're awake . Look , it 's all right , I 'll go back . You know what you 're looking for . Look , stay within the walls . Don 't go too far . Daddy ? Mummy ? Mummy , where are you ? Mummy ? - Daddy ! - Mummy ? Daddy , where are you ? ( SOBBING ) Don 't cry . I 'll look after you . GREG : All right , all right ! Where 's Mummy ? Oh , don 't worry , don 't worry . She won 't be long . - Please , I 'm hungry . - So am I. Yes , well , I am , too . But there 's a wood not very far from here , and I 'm going to go off and see if I can snare a deer . I wish we had a gun . Yes . But we haven 't got one . Are we going to stay here ? Well , why ? Wouldn 't you like to ? Can we have something to eat ? Yeah , well , look , have you ever seen anyone pull their thumb ? See ? Now , can you do that ? What 's Mummy found ? Leek broth . I pretend it 's corn flakes . Mmm , bacon and eggs . Sausage and mash . Toast and marmalade . Rolls and coffee . Any more ? No . Right , well , I am going to snare a deer , and then we 'll have venison . And a turkey . - And an ostrich . - Ew ! Yeah , well , I 'll be back soon . Now , look , why don 't you all go exploring ? There 's lots of rooms to look into . See if you can find an old wire coat hanger , and work out if you can make a fishnet of it . JOHN : How ? Well , with a string vest or some wire netting or an old T-shirt . There 's a river out there . There might be some fish in it . Yes , but they might be poisoned . Remember those trout ? No , it 's a fast-running stream , straight from the mountains . And where there 's no money , there 's no muck . Come on . Look , two doors . Isn 't it big ? Yes . A sort of palace . - Let 's play hide-and-seek . - All right . I go first . You always go first . Why ? Don 't you want to play ? All right . Right , close your eyes , count slowly , and no cheating . I don 't cheat . One , two , three eight , nine , ten . BARNEY : Little girl . ( SCREAMING ) Jenny ! - It 's Lizzie ! - Wait , wait there . ( SCREAMING ) Who 's there ? Is there anyone there ? Who are you ? The dogs ... It were the dogs . Well , it were the dogs . I come in here . Well , who are you ? What 's your name ? Barney . Do you live here ? Well , the dogs ... I don 't think there 's much use . Well , the little girl , she cried . But not hurt . Not hurt her ... GREG : All right , all right , all right . Well , dogs hurt . Hurt me . You mean , you were bitten ? Bitten ? How long ago ? How long ago were you bitten ? - I don 't know , it 's very dirty . - Yeah , but is it infected ? It seems dry enough . Ten days ? I don 't know . We must have some hot water . Well , that 's it then . We 'll light the stove . ( HONKING HORN ) ( HONKS ) ( BANGING ) TOM : Will you please let me out now , then ? If we 're lucky . Pigeon for lunch . Look , one of you give me a hand with this gate , and then , Abby , drive straight into the courtyard . You may not have been the only one to have seen that smoke . It 's Abby ! - Price ? - Remember ? - Oh , I 'm so useless . - No , you 're not . Lazy , good-for-nothing . Well , he 's still got the gun . Price ? Price ! I 'm going to unbolt this door . Now , I 've got a gun here . I want you to throw yours out and then come out yourself , - nice and slowly . - Let me out ! - Now , do you understand ? - Yes , yes , anything ... Right . What the hell 's all this ? An arsenal ? - Are those Wormley ' s ? - Aye ? - Well , well , well ... - Did you steal them ? No , well ... No , no ! To tell you the truth ... Hey , are they after you ? Uh , well , now , I tell you the truth . It 's like this , you see ... Let 's go and eat . I was driving along and ... Bad brakes , what ... Oh , thank you , Mrs Cohen . I can 't remember when I tasted anything better . It was absolutely nothing . Thank you , too , Tom , for being so generous . Oh , that 's all right , man , just a few tins , right ? What about John ? He found some wonderful herbs . But tomorrow ... Tomorrow , I 'll really show you . If I have anything fresh to cook . Well , we might have caught something in the snares by then . Snares ? That 's right , boy . Good , lad . GREG : And now , of course , we 've got plenty of ammunition . Cartridges . The money of the future , you mark my words . Tomorrow , children , tomorrow ... ( SMACKING LIPS ) You know , I don 't see a reason why there shouldn 't be - plenty of fish in that river . - Fish ! - And chips ! - We need potatoes for chips . ( ALL LAUGHING ) ( STRUMMING GUITAR ) What are you going to play ? Oh , I don 't know . I mean , nothing really fits any more , does it ? She won 't be coming round the mountain or anything like it . Ah , quite an audience . And now there are nine . So , what do we do ? Stay on here ? Keeps the dogs out . I wish Ben would come back . So do I. If he does , you 're not to go near him , do you understand ? Why ? - And you 're to call one of us . - Why ? Oh , it 's all right . The dogs haven 't got rabies . If they had , well , Barney would be really sick by now . Well , let 's move on , then . This place gives me the creeps . You mean , you 'd rather stay in the bus or the tent ? Well ... Now , look , we can 't have another night like last night . We 've got to settle . Well , it 's nice and snug here and you can defend it , too . Better than Wormley 's place . ( HUMMING ) ( VOCALIZING ) ( SHEEP BLEATING ) What 's that ? - TOM : What ? - Shh ! ( SHEEP BLEATING ) Sheep ! GREG : Now , I 'm going to take this area down to the river . I want you two to go through the garden and cover the hill on the other side . TOM : Right-o , Greg , boy . And don 't just put these down anywhere . I want them set by well-established rabbit runs . Now , don 't worry , Greg , boy , you 're talking to an expert . Uh-huh . Well , let 's have a look at your hands . - Aye ? - Come on . - Oh . - Now , when did you last wash them ? Well , I don 't get a chance , see ? I mean , there 's no point , there 's ... Look , the rabbits will smell you a mile off . Now , before you set these , rub your hands in the earth . Then that 's all the rabbits will smell . Now , that 's a good tip , Greg , boy . Now , that 's a good tip . We 'll remember that . We 'll remember that , Greg , boy . Bit of a know-all , you see . Too clever by half . You stick with me , Barney , boy . You won 't go far wrong . Come on , Barney . Ah ... Ah , now ... Now , here 's a good place . Now , this is a good place , Barney . Shh . Don 't make a noise , see . You make a noise and they 'll hear you , see , and keep away . Now , this is what we do . See ... And we take this and lay it across there . Yes . And ... Oh , you don 't want to worry about Mr Know-all , man . He 's what you call an amateur . It 's experience that counts . Now , I 'll tell you , now , I 've caught more rabbits than he 's had hot dinners . I 'm famous for this , see ? I 've made a name for myself , back ... Do you know what they used to call me back home ? ( SPEAKING WELSH ) Tom the Moler . Mole catcher . It 's Welsh . It ... It ... Oh , it doesn 't matter . Now , here , you lay this down , now , we tie this securely , see , across there ... Horse ? No , it 's not a horse , man . It 's rabbits we 're after . It 's too small for a horse . Horse . Oh , well , he thinks we 're after catching a horse . Now , hold this . Horse tail . No , no , this is wire , man . It 's wire . Better horse tail . Don 't be daft , man . Look . What 's this , now , then ? Horse tail . Oh , horse hairs , is it ? Where 'd you get this , then ? Horse . Horse ? Oh , horse , yeah , well , ask a daft question . Uh , made it , did you ? Made . Well ... Well , now , then , that 's not bad . Now , that 's not bad at all . Fair dues . There 's more to you than meets the eye , I 've got to give you that . Yes , that 's good . That 's very good . The only thing is you 've got to get rid of that knot , see , 'cause it stops it drawing tight and you won 't kill the rabbit that way . Oh , I ... I not kill . Not kill rabbit . Not hurt rabbit . GREG : Well , the grazing 's good enough . That field over there is planted with a cereal , by the look of it . And there 's a walled garden , so the soil there should be pretty good . What about cows and pigs ? Well , we can use the out buildings on the other side for a sty or a barn , or even a stable . There 's no reason why we shouldn 't have horses . And Price is right , Abby . This place is defensible . We can withdraw in it . Might even find an old well . Even if there isn 't , we can always dig one . Hey , Barney , boy ! Look at this . It 's ... It 's a clump of carrots , man . Oh , boy , let 's see what else we 've got here , huh ? Oh , here we are , Barney . Look at that . Potatoes ? Good boy , good boy . Potatoes . ( EMMA VOCALIZING ) Who says no music fits , hmm ? ( CHUCKLING ) GREG : It 's worth a try , isn 't it ? JENNY : Hey , Abby , Greg , hello ! ABBY : Hi ! ( BEN BARKING ) - Oh , you ! You are bad ! - Traitor . Yes , you are ! You 're bad ! You 're so bad ! JOHN : Ben ! - Ben ! - Ben ! - Ben ! - Benny Ben ! Ben ! ( BARKING ) Abby , I think we 're home .

 Major Bradbury to communication bridge ! Major Bradbury to communication bridge ! Nuclear com-force to main engine room ! Nuclear com-force to main engine room ! Major Bradbury to communication bridge ! Major Bradbury to communication bridge ! What is it like , the planet we 're approaching ? Nothing but ice and snow . A barren desert of whiteness . Scan it with our computer waves . The enemy 's weapons may be hidden beneath its surface . Aha ! Looks like the cops . As Thor , chief of the imperial police , I order you to surrender at once Stella , you cheap smuggler I am police robot M. You have the right to remain silent . Go for hyper space . Let 's hope this star-buggy stays together . What 's our chances ? 40 % total disintegration .. 30 % molecular ignition .. .. 20 % gamma contamination . You are very reassuring I assume that means - we have a 10 % chance of making it . Not really ! 3 % structural collapse 3 % ... Alright Alright ! Just keep on course and get ready to reenter normal space . Ready when you are . We 've done it ! We 've done it ! Not quite . Look ! The Nutrant star ! If it gets a hold on us , it 'll crush us . Prepare to release Ath-Power stage . Eject ! Eject ! Ha Ha ! We made it . Plot us a new course , so that cop cant find us . Even as you speak . It 's been taken care of . There 's the border of the haunted stars . If we 'd traveled one second further , we would have wound up right beside them . What in the universe is that ? It 's a spaceship . No , its a launch . Their power is totally down . Maybe they 're wounded , to weak to send a signal . I 'm gonna have a look . What 's the radiation level ? Normal . The hull isn 't damaged . I 'm going inside . Is everything alright ? Yes ! Wait a minute .. There 's someone here . He looks like he 's hurt pretty bad , but he 's alive I 'll try to get him back to the ship . I 'll help you bring him aboard . He 's dehydrated . Suffering from exhaustion . But the launch was full of supplies . Everything he could have needed . He 's also in chock . He keeps talking about monsters .. .. Red monsters He wants us to alert someone .. Urgently . Who ? The Emperor of the first circle of the universe . It 's the emblem of the chief officers of the imperial navy . I 'd say red hot potatoes for small time smugglers on the run like us . We 'll , what do we do ? You go to prison , Stella star . Your leap through hyperspace didn 't fool us . Your friction trail was easy to follow . Hehehe .. You are completely surrounded by fighter ships . This time you 've won . We surrender . There won 't be a next time , Stella Star ! Don 't worry . We 'll get out of this . My Lord ! Yes . What is it Ellrik ? They found one damned survivor . Right now , the imperial shuttle ship has taken him to their medical centre . But his brain seems to be thoroughly damaged He will be of no help to them , to find the ship . Mhmm .. Come to me , Golem ! I have a simple task for you . You must not fail me . Therefore , the great machines of the central operating system .. .. of imperial justice hereby sentence you , Akton , of ninth Vega .. .. to 220 years hard labor in the prison planet of Ze-com the 3rd . As for you , Stella Star , having considered all the arguments .. Studied all the Video-tapes , the accusations .. .. we condemn you to forced labor for life .. .. in the penal colony .. .. of Nocturne the 2nd This session is hereby adjourned . Throw the radium into the furnace . Careful now . I said let 's go , move ! Faster ! Move , Let 's go ! Will you step it up ! Here ! You can move faster than that ! Careful with that Radium . Will you move ! Move down those stairs ! Throw it the furnace ! Do what I tell you ! Where do you think you are . We haven 't got all day ! Alright , 5 minutes of rest Move quickly now ! Prisoners get back to their posts ! Let 's go ! Come on quickly now ! Let 's go ! I 've been at this for 12 straight hours .. .. the radiation will burn my skin off . Were not slaves . You 'd better work . If you don 't want the taste of the burning of their energy whips too . But there must be a way to escape . There will be a way , you know . Blow ups happen . If I could only succeed in overfeeding the furnace . But overfeed it with what ? Energy ! Then a gun ray could be enough . Planing an escape ! This is what you 're gonna get , lady ! You can drop the riffle-ray . Now turn around . You ! I bet you never expected to see me here . And you too . Poor Stella . Your escape efforts have been wasted . OK . I 've lost again . We were sent to free you , your sentence has been cancelled . Have you both gone mad ? I only have logic animotion circuits . No room for craziness . Well , I 've been assigned to a top secret imperial mission , we must now leave and set Akton free . There , he 's yours My gift to you . Would I lie to you ? Look , it is the imperial flagship . Akton , you are gonna meet some real royalty . He 's here ! There is his holographic image . His Highness ; The emperor of the first circle of the universe . I come to you because my faithful robot , Elle , has told me .. .. that you are the only one who could save us . You know , you must be the best pilot in the whole galaxy .. .. and you Akton , the best navigator . Stella , our galaxy is split .. .. into 2 waring factions . Our own and the one ruled by the evil count .. .. Zarth Arn ! From the league of the dark worlds . Recently we 've begun to receive troublesome reports from our spies among the league . They have informed us that the count has created a weapon .. .. a new , limitless weapon . A Weapon so vast , so huge .. .. that it would take a whole planet to conceal it . That is why we sent the mission ship . Did they find the planet ? The ship came so close .. .. so close .. .. to discovering the counts secret .. .. when it was suddenly attacked by a horde of unknown monsters . We had assumed it was destroyed , we lost all hope . Until you found the launch from that ship . And now , with the utmost secrecy .. .. you must sail to the haunted stars . You must find that ship . Find the counts secret planet and destroy it . There 's something else . When you complete the mission .. .. search for the commander .. .. of that missing ship . He was my only son . The first possibility is the Origa system . Also know as the worlds asleep . But this system is still within our galaxy and we should 've found it by now . The same also applies to the white sun of Ohzon so only the third possibility remains : The heart of the haunted stars . An unknown planet named .. Euraphas ! Well , shall we begin our search ? Lets go ! The distance we must travel is enormous . By using hyperspace , what would normally take 2 months to reach We should do in 2 hours . Everything ready ? Ready ! Right ! Every time I go into hyperspace I get nervous . Prepare for re-entry to normal space . We 've arrived ! Its not very far from here . You can reach by using the space shuttle . Thor and I will wait for you there . Hidden in that canyon . So that were ready in case of another surprise attack of the count . That sounds fine with me . Is there air out there ? Yeah . Yeah you can breathe . Alright. lets go ! Follow me ! I 'm sure you can operate the shuttle ship . The controls are easy ! Now watch your step right here . Take care . You alright ? You bet . Lets go . Don 't you think were a little low ? I haven 't been programmed to walk on water . Ohh me. water makes me so nervous Everything makes you nervous . It 's the launch . Lets land . OK ! Take it in easy . Shuttle to star-ship ! We are landing now . Roger . Out . My seat-belt 's stuck . Oh Elle , come on ! Take it easy , I 'm coming . Look at that ! Amazing ! It 's almost buried . The impact was tremendous . I doubt if anyone could have survived . The nuclear exhaust ports have been gutted by fire . We 'd better look around . What 's that ? I don 't know . Seems to be a planetary artifact . Well , it certainly is an antique . Looks like some sort of Laser spear . This planet is inhabited . We must be very careful . We are in the evil counts domain . These stars are extremely far and remote , even for him . Probably they 've set up a fully independent kind of civilization . We 're wasting time . We 'd better start looking for the missing crew . Come on . Lets go this way . Look ! Amazons on horseback . I hope they are friendly . We 'll soon find out . Take my revenge . Kill ' em . Die robot . You 'll pay for this - All of you ! Don 't make us kill you . Come on ! Stop ! There is no escape . Take your hands off of me . Let me go . Get your hands off of me . Let me go . Queen Querrelia . This is the spy we captured . She came through the forbidden sea . You 're a spy . As the men from the launch were too . But nothing is going to stop the count anymore . Even if you had passed by this world .. .. you 'd never be able to discover the counts planet . Two packs of murdering guardians are there to watch and protect it from intruders . .. and now : Put her into the mind probe . No ! No ! Hold it right there ! Elle ! Release her or I 'll blast your queen . I mean it . Come on now . Don 't you people move or you are dead . Give me the trouble and I 'm gonna clean out your sinuses real good lady Now you stand there . Ok , Close the door . Don 't you follow us now . Stop them ! Stop them ! Behind you ! Come on , lets go ! Elle you 're terrific . I didn 't know you had it in you . Where 's the release mechanism ? It 's jammed ! Take cover ! Here goes the last shot . Full power ! Come on , lets go ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Guardian .. .. take my revenge . Kill them . Look ! Whoa ! Run for your life ! There ! That narrow passage in the rocks . Come on Stella , run ! Hurry ! Oh ! Elle ! We better move ! The amazon air-fighters will be here soon . Quick , to the ship ! They 're attacking . I 'll man the laser-canon . Specter 7 .. Fire ! Ok , get ready . Here they come . Power is up to full battle speed . You ! Why don 't you come back now ? Here they come . Specter 3 . Alright . We 've got them ! Fire ! Fire ! Yeah ! One more . There 's one more ! We 've got ' em . Watch out on the right . We 're down from 6 to 5 . Get ready . More to the left . Steady . Then fire 5 . Then 6 . Fire the laser-canon , robot . Fire ! Yeah ! Hahaa ! We got it ! We 're holding . Now ! 8 ships approaching from the right . Fire ! Alright , we 've won . We did it . I found the positions to both the 3rd launch and the mother-ship . The mother-ship is closest so we 'll check it out first . It 's here . On the 3rd planet of the next solar system . I 've never been there . What 's it like ? Red fogs , high winds , low gravity . The air is breathable . And the atmospheric conditions are stable . However .. The entire planet is covered with ice and snow . And you must be extremely careful when the sun sets . The temperature drops thousands of degrees . And in an instant , everything freezes over . What a terrible crash . No-one could have survived . Do you see any signs of the emperors son ? If he 's in the middle of all this I don 't even know if his own mother would recognize him . Then it 's all over . There 's no hope of ever finding the counts secret fortress . There 's still the third launch . It 's probably lost out in the stars , who knows ? Anyway , it 's useless to raise false hopes . It 's been too long . And this galaxy is wild and hostile . Come on Elle , lets go back to the ship . We 'd better hurry . We 're running out of time and our power-packs are nearly finished . Let 's get rid of them . It 's gonna be a long walk back . My feet are already cold . It 's times like these i 'm glad to be a robot . What 's the matter with you , Akton ? Well , I 'm just refining my powers . And what 's your problem , ships-computer , huh ! Is everything alright with Stella and Elle ? I 'm not worried about them . I 'm just waiting . Your waiting is over . At last Thor . You have some good news for me ? Yes Excellency . I have killed the alien pathfinder .. .. and taken over this ship . What of Stella Star ? And that tin policeman . This planet will take care of them , Excellency . Good ! And I await your immediate arrival . Elle , how much further ? We should be close . Just a few more radiants . Ships-computer ! Why aren 't the main engines firing ? There is a malfunction . A malfunction ? Where ? I am not programmed for this malfunction . Akton ! We 're here ! Akton ! Thor ! Let us in . The sun is setting . That 's exactly why I 'm not letting you in . Soon you 'll be dead and I 'll be gone from this planet . Have you gone crazy ? Open this hatch ! No ! Where 's Akton ? Akton is dead . And I 'm leaving to join Count Zarth-Arn .. .. as the prince of the League of Darkness . Thor , a traitor ? I cannot believe it . I cannot trust my own logic circuits anymore . He fooled me too . It 's no use . We 're gonna freeze . Maybe not . Maybe I can save you . Let 's stop here . Now you lie down in the snow , face up . Okay . Now give me your hand so I can monitor your temperature . I can use my energy to keep your heart working . You 'll be in a state of suspended animation . Elle ! As an opponent , I always knew you were programmed to never give up . Which was infuriating . But now that quality .. .. must be .. .. best . You are the most faithful companion a woman ever had . And I too , respect you , Stella . You are the nicest human being I 've known . Now , maybe , is a good time to use your ancient system of prayer . And hope it works for robots , as well . Goodbye my friend . Goodbye for now , Stella . You were expected here hours ago ! I 've been delayed by a malfunction . I don 't tolerate malfunctions .. .. or inefficiency here in my realm How long will the delay be ? I think a very long time . You shouldn 't try taking off without asking me first . This time I 'll make sure you are dead . I 'll fix you . Alright Akton . This is it . Say goodbye . What ? Stop ! Put down the gun . Stop ! No-one can survive these deadly rays . Those deadly rays will be your death . Elle ? Elle , do you read me ? This is Akton . I 've taken over the ship . Do you read me ? Her pulse rate is 16 . She may survive if you can use your powers and bring her back slowly . Careful now . Close the hatch . Look ! It 's working ! She 's going to make it . Come on Stella ! Whats wrong ? The main engines will not fire . Thor must have tried everything . What are we gonna do now ? So .. We get out of one mess .. .. just to find ourselves in another . Not necessarily . What do you mean ? We are stuck ! Even the transmitter is out of order . We can take off immediately . Take off ? How ? The ship is not operating , simply because I borrowed this reactor . Then you knew about Thor . Yes I did . So you see into the future . All these years you never told me . Think of all the trouble I might have avoided You have tried to change the future . Which is against the law . So therefore , I can tell you nothing . Let 's find the 3rd launch . Akton , you are something else ! Yes . Time is running out . Lets go ! We 're arriving . That 's the planet Demundia . There in barren land and wast emptiness we 'll find the 3rd launch . Somethings wrong . Everything has stopped . What 's happening ? Power failure ! My circuits ! My circuits are failing . We 've been hit . By an energy beam . I am out of control . Look ! What is it ? It must be the Counts weapon ! Oh my head , oh ! Fire , you stupid robot ! Fire ! What 's happening ? Here , let me help you . The attack is over . You 'll be alright . I thought I was gonna go insane . We 've just survived an attack of the most powerful weapon in the entire galaxy . If Akton 's calculations are correct we should find the launch this way . In a crater just over .. There ! Oh me ! Don 't say it . Don 't say I know .. Steam makes you nervous . No , no ! Not really . Why should I be nervous ? There is nothing to be afraid of round here . Looks totally wrecked but it 's definitely the third launch . I 'd better go down . No , I insist . Time for a little robot-chauvinism . You stay here . Be careful Elle . You do not have to worry about me ! Release her ! Let me down ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Don 't .. Don 't .. Relax . Take it easy . I 'll cut you down . There . You 're free . That was a little too close for comfort . Come on . Come on ! We rest here . This is safe . Who are you ? This is an energy-shield mask . And the amount of energy is limited . My name is Simon . I 'm the only survivor from the wreck of an imperial mission . Are you really ? We 've been searching for you all through these damned haunted stars . Why ? The emperor 's orders were to find the Count 's phantom planet and to destroy it . So you know about the monsters ? Yes I do . But it 's useless . We did not succeed in find the planet either . And now there 's no time left . The cavemen will waiting for us . Alright , stay very close and very quiet . Oh , this way looks safe . This way . Simon ! No ! Akton ! You alright ? Akton , thank god you got here in time . You must 've known all along . By the way , this is Simon . The only survivor from the imperial mission . We owe you our lives . Now maybe .. .. with your help , we can still find the Count 's phantom planet Lets go aboard your ship and continue on at once . There 's no need to continue . Have you gone crazy ? That 's our primary mission : To find the planet and destroy it . I know , but we 've already found it . Think about it . Then you 'll understand that this is the Count 's planet . Remember what the Amazon queen said : A planet occupied by two packs of evil defenders . The first we met while in space . The red monsters . And the second .. Right here . The Troglodytes . And there 's no question about it . This is the planet ! This ? That 's incredible . I was here and I didn 't even realise it . There 's no way you could have . Anyway , we proceed at once and destroy all that machinery . Right ? Right . There is the door that 'll take us to the machinery . This is the Counts secret domain . The very heart of the phantom planer . From here he plan to control the entire universe . This is incredible . Where is everybody ? Everything is set in our destiny . Soon you 'll know all the answers . This will take us to operation headquarters . After you , my dear . Here 's the nerve center of the entire operation . This is unbelievable . Fantastic . Pre-programmed computers . They could run forever . All these power modules , what are they for ? This is the force that projected the red monsters into space . Then this is the way they produced real monsters ? No . Not real . The monsters never existed . These machines discharged mental projections of monsters in our brains There 's the control-panel . Well , destiny must take it 's course . No , we can 't allow this to happen . We must destroy it , at once . You 've been very lucky . And clever . You survived every trap that I 'd lay for you . Then I realized that your success would become my triumph . How much time is left , Captain ? Half a quadrant to go , My-lord . You hear ? In less than an hours time All that 'll be left of this planet Will be ashes and cosmic dust . Forever . Then you will be among the dead . The emperor will make you pay for this . The Emperor ? I forgot to inform you .. .. that the Emperor will be blown to pieces along with the rest of you . Yes ! I told the emperor that we had found you on this planet . He 's on his way here now , at top speed . He 'll get here just in time .. .. to join the fireworks . I 'm sorry , your highness . You 've lost . Highness ? Forgive me Stella . But in the beginning I didn 't know whose side you were on . And after-wards I didn 't know how to tell you Yes , he is Simon , son of the Emperor and heir to the throne . You two are to prevent them from leaving this room at all cost . You will stay with them until the end . Kill them .. .. if you have to . Now it will be just a matter of waiting . An hour goes by quickly . We 've got to get past those golems . Yes , but how ? Have faith . And never give up hope . Look out ! We are now approaching Demundia . All crewmen to landing stations . All crewmen to landing stations . Don 't worry . Don 't worry . You and the prince will live . Akton , you 've got to get up . We must get away from here . I shall remain here . Please get up , please . I 'm no longer useful at this time . You 're talking nonsense . You can heal yourself in no time at all . No . I must obey destiny . Akton ! We 'll carry you . Go . It 's your duty . You must live . I can 't . I can 't leave you . You 're the only human-like friend I ever had . I don 't understand . You never die . Stella , Stella . I 've accomplished the mission . Yes , but I .. Others are coming . Even as I speak they 'll rescue you . Don 't worry . I 'll live forever . Now go . Go . Father ! We must leave at once . 48 seconds left to the explosion . We 've got to get out of here . It 's true father . The Count has mined the planet with nuclear charges . We 're all about to die . You know something , my boy ? I wouldn 't be emperor if I didn 't have some powers at my command . Imperial battle-ship ! Holt .. .. the flow of time . In the space of 3 minutes Every molecule on this planet will be immobilized . But after the third minute The green ray loses it 's power . Time will flow once again . And everything will explode . Three minutes are enough , father . Now , the Count believe that we are dead . That our armies have dispersed . And that we have no leader . He is supremely confident that he can overcome us with the greatest of ease . Well then . Now is the time to surprise him . We will attack his headquarters before his fleets can join him . If we succeed in this we could save billions of lives . Gather together all our legions . Sir ! And order the attack . By sunset , I 'll be the new Emperor . And I will be the master of the whole universe . Kill them ! Enemy arriving with torpedoes . Prepare for attack . Kill ! Kill ! Over there . We 've got them , father . It 's working Kill ! Kill ! Kill them ! Let 's squad . Come on Over there , quickly . Now let 's give the Emperor a great reception . Put in use the mightiest weapon . The doom-machine . Send it off to towards the Emperor 's capital world and destroy the emperor 's imperial planet . Zarth-Arn ! Yeah ! It 's over . We 're finished . We 've lost . No . No , there 's still a way . There 's one solution left . I 'm afraid we 're forced to use it . What ? Starcrash ! Four dimensional attack . Yes ! If we can re-enter space at the precise moment the impact of surprise upon the Count will be so overwhelming that he cannot halt us . But father , there is not a weapon powerful enough . Oh yes , there is . The floating city . The floating city . Yes , yes I know . Although we destroy it 's hope , it 's future .. .. I 'm afraid we must sacrifice it . By setting it towards the Count 's fortress . It 's our only way . Now you must help me . Both of you . Go ! And direct it 's course . Zoltan ! Yes , my-lord . Now set the doom-machine against the imperial space station itself . How long will it take ? 15 minutes . The set it in motion . I want to wipe out the Emperor from the whole of the universe . Yes , my-lord . When do we reach the floating city ? In less than 2 minutes . Right . I 'll check the docking facility . Right ! Everything checks out OK . Look ! The floating city . Already evacuated . The technicians have already set the charges and freed the atomic engines . If everything goes smoothly I 'll try to eject myself as soon as I re-enter space . But surely I 'll come with you ! No , no , no ! It 's more important that you stay here to rescue me once this is all over . Alright . I 'll stay . But I cannot let you go alone . In fact our best scientists have spent the last few hours reconstructing an old friend of yours . Elle ! You can 't keep a good robot down . This is incredible , they rebuild you . But how ? You look marvelous . Very carefully . And they used the latest components . I feel like a new machine . Go now . Quickly ! The survival of our galaxy is in your hands . This will take us directly to the control-room . We have a lot to do in a very short time . Get ready to ease out of orbit . This doesn 't make you nervous , does it ? I 've never flown a city before . Well , leave it to me . Build up maximum energy . We must leap through the very heart of the stars . Prepare to transit . 8 degrees . Ok . I 'm ready . My-lord ! Yes Ellrik ? A floating ship is about to crash into us . What ? Zoltan ! Yes my-lord . Destroy the floating ship approaching us . It can 't be done . It 's too close . There it is . Dead-ahead . Alright ! The Count 's fighters . We 've got to evade them . All systems prepare for full power . Let 's lock in these controls . Move it out . Quick . Right ! Let 's go ! Come back , you fools . You cowards . Come back and fight . My-lord ? Yes ! Come , or you 'll be destroyed . You stay here . Go ! Let 's get out of here or there won 't be enough left of me to put back together . You can bet on that ! Circuits , don 't fail me now . Zarth-Arn ! Zarth-Arn ! It 's Simon . Simon ! We 're over here . Stella . Stella ! And welcome home . Stella ! Simon ! Ah Stella . Simon . Is that so . Well .. It 's done It 's happened . The stars are clear . The planets shine . We 've won . Oh , some dark force no doubt Will show it 's face once more . The wheel will always turn . But for now it 's calm . And for a little time .. .. at least .. .. we can rest .

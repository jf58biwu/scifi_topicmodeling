 May I offer you the first toast of the evening ? - No speeches ! - Mullrine and McDee . To the millions they make out of pain and misery . To our hosts - charlatans and purveyors of blood . - Howard , you are a pest . - Who are you ? ! I 'm ... I 'm ... Do you think he 's drunk , Arthur ? A bit squiffy ? On the contrary , he 's a bit dead . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' Out of my way . - Don 't touch him . - I am the doctor around here ! Cyanide . - Cyanide , no doubt . - Greville , did you decant the port ? - Of course but ... - Anyone could have tampered with it ? - Yes , sir . - I 've warned him about drinking . - What are you going to do ? - Me ? - It 's your house ! - What a mess , this tablecloth ... - This is no time for tablecloths ! - Quiet , darling . Arthur ? I never did like the fellow , he was a damn nuisance . - He hadn 't the brains of a flea . - Vultures ! The poor boy 's not even cold and you 're picking over his bones ! Hardly ! Though I wonder , what happens to his shares ? - I 'll not listen to this . - Oh , no , you stay here ! Everyone will until we get to the bottom of this . - Miles , lock that door . - I don 't think it 'll ... - I said lock it ! - You might as well . Thank you . Sit down . Miles , you 're going to question us , find out who had the best motive - we all had good ones . We should move Howard . He doesn 't look comfortable . - Don 't touch him ! - What ? Take your hands off my son . - Your son ? - Never forget , Emma , I know . Haven 't you done enough damage ? ! Great God , I 'm away back to my laboratory . You can 't ... I have the key . Oh , my God ! - I need a drink . - I shouldn 't if I were you . Tell me , there was ... I didn 't imagine it all , did I ? No , you didn 't imagine it . What 's going to happen to me ? I 'm next , aren 't I ? There is danger in this house for all of us . - Very good , Emma ! - How can you be so calm ? ! Veronica , then Tony , now Howard ! - When you get to my age ... - How old are you , Arthur ? - What ? - Really , what a question ! One should never ask anyone 's age over 30 . Emma , you 're three years younger than I am . - How old is that ? - Greville ... - We 're ready for coffee . - Wait , what about Howard ? ! - Who ? - Howard ! Howard McDee ! He was here ! Greville , sprinkle some salt on the tablecloth , - someone has upset the port . - I hope it wasn 't George . - George ? Where is he ? - In his laboratory . Why did I ever marry that man ? He thinks more of his work than he does of me . Don 't complain , remember how lucky you are . Greville , serve coffee in the lounge . - Yes , Mr Mullrine . - " Mr Mullrine " ? - Miss Emma , excuse us . - How can they ? ! Greville , will you leave us , please ? Yes , madam . - They 're under no immediate threat . - And we are ? Yes . What year were you born , Mr Harborough ? Me ? 1931 . - And your wife ? - Later . Much later . - Thank you . - It seems obvious . What ? ! You 're talking in riddles ! - You 're both in danger . - Of being murdered ? - Something like that . - Do you know who it is ? - More or less . - Well , tell us . Who ? ! No ... living soul . Oh , this is preposterous ! If you really are a detective , isn 't it time you did some detecting ? Particularly if I 'm going to be next ! We 're dealing with something far more important . I 'm going to speak to Arthur ! For once in your life , my darling , a very good idea ! June 22nd , 1930 . Present that night were Mullrine and Emma , Felicity and George . And Greville - he went through the door . Yes . He 's older than he looks . How will it deal with Felix and Annabelle ? How else do humans destroy one another ? Oh ... they have so many ways . - Ah , the new record ! - Arthur , could I have a word ? - I adore it , don 't you , Felicity ? - No , it 's rather vulgar . - Then it 'll make money , my dear . - Very probably . I think I 'm going mad ! It 's so up-to-date ! It 's as much a part of 1930 as Amy Johnson , or the R100 airship . Airship ? That 'll make a packet for someone with enough capital and foresight . What 's that ? - Airships ! - Don 't be so silly ! We 're spending hundreds of thousands of pounds to build great ocean liners - when the real future is up there ! - Arthur ! Yes , up there in the skies . Look at the way the R100 can fly all the way to Canada . - I should love to fly an aeroplane . - You couldn 't fly a kite . - It 's awfully difficult . - Amy Johnson can do it . I heard a talk she gave about her flight and she was talking all the way from Australia ! - Yes . Fancy . - Wouldn 't you like to fly ? - With wings ? - Silly , an aeroplane . Arthur says I 'm too idiotic , what do you say ? - Well , I ... - Sit down , whoever you are . - Why shouldn 't ladies fly ? - Felix ! They do most other things nowadays . Drive motorcars . - Motorbikes . - Felix ! Oh , you are so funny ! I can 't stand any more of this ! You 're all mad ! All of you ! Quite mad ! It could be any one of you ! Poor Annabelle , it 's not right ! - She isn 't dead . - No one has been murdered . - You 'll have to suspend disbelief . - I know this is hard to accept . Mr Harborough , you 're a shrewd man , can you give me a rational explanation for what 's happened ? There has been a time change , this house has been moved back in time . Back to 1930 . And to be consistent , everyone who wasn 't born then has had to be eliminated . - Hence these murders . - But they never happened . Time has simply been suspended . You call that a rational explanation ? I call it lunacy . You should be locked up , the pair of you ! I wouldn 't be surprised to find you were at the bottom of this whole damn business ! I am not Miles Cavendish . And I am not Virginia Cavendish . Thank you , Greville . They played this at the Kit Kat ... So no one has been killed . You won 't die . You 're a kind of interplanetary police force ? - Yes . - Aliens of some sort ? - In an extraterrestrial sense . - You 've been sent here ? - To keep order . - Capricious elements are at work . You might consider my feelings at a time like this . Time is not as rigid as you believe . - With respect ... - No more words , Sapphire . Show him . You ought to listen to them , Felix . Do what they say . They really are who they say they are . It 's quite extraordinary , and fun . Fun ? But ... you 're dead . You died there . Not really . Halfway , if you like . It 's marvellous ! I 've learned more up here than down there . - Where are you ? - Haven 't the faintest . Sort of floating . Waiting . I can look at anything I want . As a matter of fact I was just watching my first day at school . - Fascinating . - It 's a trick . No , it 's not a trick , Felix . All right . If you can see anything you want , what is the ... What 's the ... colour ... What 's the colour of the lining paper in my shirt drawer ? That 's a bit of a teaser , Felix ! Hang on a moment . Good lord ! Someone 's used old wallpaper ! Regency stripe - gold on white . We don 't have time for any more questions . Who are you ? I am known as Steel . Sapphire . Sapphire ... and Steel . - Are there more of you ? - Oh , yes . - Bronze , Lead ... - Silver . I see . - Code names . - We need your help . Very well . Who shall I be ? Platinum ? Diamond ? Tin ? How about Brass ? That will do fine . What do you want me to do ? Find out if Greville could have been in this house in 1930 . - Right . - Before you go ... you 'll need this . 'Can you hear me ? ' - Of course I can . - ' Don 't speak , just think . ' 'She has got very pretty eyes . ' - ' Thank you . ' - ' Don 't mention it . ' Good lord ! Ah , Greville . - Sir ! - What were you doing ? I found these wires leading from the fuse box , sir , it looked dangerous . Do you recognise the wire ? Do you keep any more like it ? No , sir . It looked the sort of thing Mr McDee might have in his laboratory . Who could have done such a terrible thing ? Who indeed ? Any one of us might have opened that door . I think not . I think it was meant only for your wife . - Show me where it goes . - It 's under the back stairs . You know this house well , Greville . Have you lived here long ? He can 't handle communication . I only gave him the first level . - Anyway , how can he help us ? - I was getting him out of the way . It 'll take his mind off it . It 'll come as a surprise . How very considerate of you . Speaking of death , what about George McDee ? - He died on the 22nd . - It 's twenty-five to twelve now . Mullrine has an office through the living room . McDee was an eminent scientist . His death would have been reported . - There 'll be a record in the office . - Yes but that 's in 1980 . You could never do it . 'Now ? ' 'Not yet . ' There it is but how do we open it ? It has no lock , no handle , remember ? How does Mullrine open it ? Electronically . He generates a signal . - What frequency ? - 30 kilohertz . Higher . Ah , Virginia , here 's our fourth . Two clubs or forcing two ? - Culbertson . I always play one club . - Smashing ! - Arthur always plays with Greville . - I taught him everything he knows . - Good evening . - Oh ! How did you get in here ? - Through the door . - But you can 't , it isn 't working . You 're not a ghost , are you ? - Ghost ? - Well , there was ... I 'm sorry . - Can I help you ? - No . Thank you . I can manage . Excuse me . Do you mind ? What operates the door ? Just one moment , I don 't care if you are a guest , you can 't walk in ... You 're looking tired , Felicity , dear . Isn 't it time for bed ? Let me finish my cocoa first . - How can you drink it so hot ? - Take it up with you . Don 't be in such a hurry , Emma . Arthur will play cards all night and I never know when George comes to bed . We can sleep late in the morning . Very well , if that 's the way you feel about it . But remember , one minute 's sleep before midnight ... - All right ... ... is worth one hour after . - If it means so much to you . Oh ! - Careful . You 're spilling it . No trumps . No bid . Ah , Miles , thought we 'd lost you . Your bid , partner . Could you help me a moment , Virginia ? Darling , not now , I 'm busy . We are vulnerable , aren 't we ? - Yes , madam . - And 30 below the line . 30 below ? What time do you make it , Felix ? Quarter past eleven . - ' Sapphire . ' - Four diamonds . - Double . - Four diamonds ? Interesting . 'Sapphire ? Sapphire , answer me . ' 'Brass here . Where were you ? ' - ' Back into the future . ' - What ? ! - What ? - Felix ? I 'm so sorry . 'Sorry . ' 'I was in Mullrine 's office . ' - ' You were away for two hours . ' - Felix ! Four , no trumps . 'It is playing with time , isn 't it ? ' 'That 's not all . ' No bid . - ' What ? ' - Five spades . 'It 's playing about with us too . ' No bid , damn it . 'It 's a mischievous force . ' Five , no trumps . 'One with a warped sense of humour . ' No bid . Six hearts . 'It 's no joke . ' A contest of wits . - What ? ! - Yes , it is . Come along , let us off the hook . What 's it going to be ? Oh . Seven diamonds . - No bid . - Pass . - Double . - Redouble . - What ? Greville ? - Content . Content . Spades ... hearts ... diamonds and ... Oh , no . Ah ... - A club . - Thank you , partner ! - Why didn 't you answer me ? - We bid seven diamonds ! - What of it ? - What do you want me to do ? I need some feminine guile . You don 't play bridge , do you ? Sorry , this is a private office . I 've come to apologise for my husband . Darling ? Sorry . Lord Mullrine has been very generous . He 's a wonderful host . Yes , he is . Does he know you 're in here ? - That 's a lovely blouse . - What ? Oh , thank you . - Where did you get it ? - Nowhere very chic . You are clever . I wish I could find things like that . - How sweet of you . - Can you help us settle an argument ? It has nothing to do with Lord Mullrine 's affairs . - It 's something from the past . What is it ? A newspaper cutting about the death of George McDee . Wasn 't it a tragedy ? - Oh , yes , it was . - He was Mullrine 's partner ? He 's been out of the picture since the ' 30s . Was it June 22nd 1930 ? It 's the date we 're arguing about . - Do you have a record of it ? - All our files are computerised now . So it could be in the computer ? - It is possible . - Oh , could you look for us ? Look , I would love to help you but I have very specific instructions . - Why don 't you ask Lord Mullrine ? - What a good idea ! - Come along , Miles . We 'll be back . - All right . - Oh , would you mind ? - There 's a handle on this side . Bye-bye . That bitch ! George McDee 's body was found in the ashes . Who else ? Was anyone else injured ? It didn 't say . Where did the fire start ? It completely destroyed the library . 700 for the rubber . 1,500 for the grand slam . Redoubled . 100 honours and 50 for the insult . Pound a hundred . - Pound a hundred ? - It 's all right , Greville . L31 . - L31 ? ! - Thank you , sir ! Shall I ? - No , leave it . - Very good , sir . L31 ! 'Say you 're tired and go to bed . ' - I 'm so tired , I 'll go to bed . - ' Take Mullrine . ' What about you , Arthur ? Yes . Ha ! I didn 't realise it was so late . 'What shall I do ? ' 'Get the details of McDee 's death . ' - How about a nightcap , Arthur ? - Yes , good idea . Thank you . - A fire ? - Yes , but where ? If you 're thinking of investing that sort of money , shouldn 't you put it to the shareholders ? What , Emma and Felicity ? - Emma and Felicity . - What do they know ? They said I was mad when I took George on as a partner . " You 've got the ideas and the capital . What do you need him for ? " Little did they know . Wasn 't George ? George is a very clever fellow , isn 't he ? You 'd like to know , wouldn 't you ? No , that 's between George and me . I 'll let you know when I 'm ready . Always kept your cards close to your chest . Is his , um ... work ... dangerous ? Dangerous ? Dangerous right off my living room and me standing here ? What exactly has he got in there ? Why don 't you see for yourself ? But surely ... We can 't go in there - he hates to be disturbed while he 's working . Not by me . Come and take a look . Go on , take a look . George ? - Good evening . - Get out ! - He 's from the bank , George . - Not now ! Leave ! I 'm sorry you 've been disturbed . - Aren 't these cultures ? - Get out of here ! You shouldn 't have done that , George ! He was only asking a question ! I 've nearly solved it ! Your temper will give the company a bad name . - It 's impossible . - There 's no doubt . There never was a fire here ? - Steel ? - None . - Steel ? - The room was destroyed . Not now , Felix ! - Not even a trace ? - Steel ! Steel ... June the 22nd . 1930 .

 ( WHIRRING ) I don 't see why we have to go around as a trio . That 's not the point , Abby . It 's just that we feel ... Well , I feel that looking for traces of Peter in this whole wide emptiness ... Well , it 's over the edge . I 'm sorry . You mean you think I 'm mad ? No , no , no . Of course I don 't think you 're mad . Look , even if you do find him you know what it 's likely to be . He can 't be alive . What I want is a house with a big fireplace and a great big kettle , and I want a hot bath . Oh , yes ! Well , let 's split then . We need to find more people , not less . We need to find a going community . We 're only an hour away from Peter 's school , Jenny . There 's bound to be an old boiler for emergencies . You can have a bath there . The school was the first place you went to . And there was nothing there but corpses . And a teacher . Somebody may have got back to him . ( DOOR OPENING ) ( DOOR SHUTTING ) ABBY : It wasn 't here before . I came along this road after I left the school . It wasn 't here . GREG : Do you want me to break in ? ABBY : Oh , I don 't know . We 're about three miles from the school . If they ran out of petrol , they 'll have walked on . There 's a garage along there . Well , I reckon they came here , refuelled on sweets and went on up to the school . Could be . Look , wouldn 't it be an idea for several people there to pump up some petrol , fill up a can and then take it back to the bus and use that ? Yes . I 'll go in one of those cars . - I 'll fill one up for you . - Thanks , Greg . Abby , if a party of schoolchildren still exists , somehow having missed the plague and have driven back here in that bus , the chances of finding Peter among them are still small . I know , I know . You said that the dormitories were full of corpses . Yes . ( SIGHS ) I 'm going to sound the horn all the way to the school . The children may be somewhere on the way . Good luck , Abby ! We 'll be along in 20 minutes . ( INDISTINCT ) GREG : Right . JOHN : Wait ! Wait ! LIZZIE : Wait ! Wait ! - JENNY : Hello . - She 's Jenny and I 'm Greg . - What 's your name ? - John . Lizzie . Elizabeth Catherine Willoughby . John James Arthur Millon . GREG : Do you both live here ? LIZZIE : Up there , in his grandmother 's house . JENNY : Is she there ? JOHN : Well , yes , but she 's dead . - Chocolate ! - Chocolate ! JENNY : And up ! ( EXCLAIMS ) Now , you 've no other friends ? People ? No , everybody 's dead . Didn 't you know that ? Yes . You 've nothing to do with the school up there ? - No . - No . Would you like to come with us ? - Yes . - Yes , because we 're hungry . The gas has given out . His granny had a cylinder and it 's empty . Liquid butane . Have you seen a boy ? What boy ? When ? A long time ago he came . He said he was driving a bus and going to school . We asked to go with him , but he said no , he 'd come back for us . But he never came . ( HORN HONKING ) ( CONTINUES HONKING ) I went to stay with my granny in the country when the plague came . - And then she got the disease ? - Yes . Where did you come from , Lizzie ? A long way away . My dad said he was ill , my mum was dead and my brother was dead and my sister was dead . And my dad said , " Just go and keep walking . " So I walked for days . And I met her . And he met me . So I went into his house . There was gas , you see . A cylinder . Liquid butane . But ... It gave out . What happened to your own clothes ? They got wet . We tried to light a bonfire . To cook . Beans . But it was raining so it didn 't light . And we got soaked . This is his granny 's coat . This is my uncle 's coat . It 's a pity the boy didn 't come back . ( BELL TOLLING ) ( SOBBING ) Come on . GREG : Abby ? Abby ! Greg . JENNY : What happened ? ABBY : Nothing . Well , and who are these ? We found them . John and Lizzie . No Peter ? No one from the bus . No , it 's just the same . Except for that teacher Bronson , who was here before . He 's gone . But no sign of where or why . This is Abby . She 's been looking for her son . - Hello . - Hello . Hello . Wasn 't the boy here ? Well , they met a boy who 'd been driving the bus . He was on his way to the school . He said he 'd come back and get them , but he didn 't turn up . Driving a bus ? One boy ? Yes . How old was he ? Twelve . We asked him . What was his name ? Glynn . Well , I don 't think he can have got here , because the dining room and the store is the same as I looked at before . Is this a church ? ( EXHALES ) It 's a sort of church . It 's the school chapel . Where God is ? Did this boy Glynn say anything about other boys ? Yes , they went on to the angels . We 'll need some new clothes , now that you 're going to look after us . ABBY : How many boys went on to the angels ? He didn 't say . He said the angels were in Derbyshire . Derbyshire ? On a mountain . That 's what he said . Three angels , they 're in the papers . What papers ? I don 't know . Glynn said he had papers , didn 't he , John ? Hmm ? Glynn said there were three angels in the papers on a mountain in Derbyshire . That 's where the other boys went . And Glynn came back to tell the school . He drove the bus . There were some papers in the bus . Glynn gave me the key of the bus . ABBY : They ' re Derbyshire papers . The eighth of September , before the plague started . There ! There . " A new Noah . " A man who 's heard the call of God had " taken the animals two by two up a mountain . " Two disciples . The word of God . " Yeah , here we are . Here we are . " Our three angels , no word from them . " How long will they stay ? They asked to be left in peace . " And they 've marked it . ( ENGINE SPUTTERING ) - It 's empty . - Yeah , we 've got the spare can . We can fill it up at the garage . Give me the key . ( CHILDREN GIGGLING ) ( GROWLING ) ( CHILDREN LAUGHING ) It 's Ben . Ben ! I 'm so glad you 're back . LIZZIE : Good old Ben . Oh , you 're super , aren 't you ? Oh , I 'm so glad you 're back . ( DOG GROWLING PLAYFULLY ) LIZZIE : Ah , yes . Super . JOHN : Ooh ! GREG : There 's something . ABBY : What ? GREG : Near the house there over the hedge . ABBY : What , that ? GREG : There 's no harm in trying it . Looks like an old railway station . Go on , then . ABBY : I don 't know if it works with boiling water . There 's a respectable stream , end of the garden . - What 's that ? - Drop scones . With raisins . We 've got a griddle if it doesn 't fall off the stove . JENNY : There we are . Well , I 'll just see if there 's any coal in the cellar . ( DOGS BARKING ) LIZZIE : Ben . Ben . Oh , it 's all right . He 'll come back once he smells those currant buns . Drop scones . JENNY : Greg , could you see if you could find me a large kettle ? Something to boil water in . I 'm desperate for a bath . Oh , no , wait till it gets hot . Oh , I wish I had a boiled egg . Yes , it would be nice . Why can 't we ? Because there 'd be no one to feed the hens . And the ones that are left are too busy looking for worms to lay eggs . I wonder how many children there are . You two have been the lucky ones . - LIZZIE : John 's seven . - Nearly eight . I wonder if any 5-year-olds could have survived on their own . Where are we going to sleep ? Well , there are beds . There 's a room for you two , a room for Jenny and me and a room for Greg . - You can try your new sleeping bags . - And the anoraks ? No , you won 't need those . Aw ... Jenny . Yes ? I 'm assuming that Greg is the odd one out . Uh , tell me if you want me to be the odd one out . Oh , no . No , nothing like that . - You will tell me ? - Yes . ( CLATTERING ) Don 't move . - Don 't move . - I 'm not . Now , just put that gun down . What do you want ? - Only this . - This is my house . Well , I didn 't know that . I didn 't see anyone . And I 'm a friend . My name 's Greg . Where are the others ? - What others ? - Don 't kid me . There are two women in the kitchen with two children . - You 're a liar . - No , I 'm not . Yesterday ... I saw you yesterday . Look , yesterday I was 200 miles away . ( GUN FIRES ) Oh , God , I didn 't mean it ! I didn 't mean it . You fool , you made me fire . I didn 't mean it . It was your fault , you came here . I 'm done for . Oh , put that gun away ! Yeah , okay . Okay . - Someone go and get the first aid kit . - ABBY : Greg ! It 's all right , he was frightened . It 's nothing , nothing , nothing . Just his arm . I didn 't mean it , accident . ( EXHALES ) Come on , Abby . It 's only blood . There 's not much damage . The bullet probably came out . I don 't have any bandages . Used to have plaster for that , plaster . I was a barber , I was . - My name 's Lincoln ... - Yeah , all right , all right , all right . Now come on , Abby . Get some of that surgical spirit on it . - I 'll get some water . - Got to clean it out , every bit of it . ( EXCLAIMS ) He 's a barber . Barbers used to be surgeons . I 'm not an old-fashioned barber . Come on , Abby , just dig in . It 's all right . Look , Jenny , take the children away , will you ? Come on . I found this place yesterday . It was all right . So I went back , you see , to collect a few things . Went back where ? Oh , we were on a farm . I don 't know much about farms but ... There were five of us , a farmer , two blokes , woman and a girl . She was about 20 . So it was all right for a couple of weeks . Then this lorry comes up yesterday . Three blokes with guns , British government . They come to protect us . So they loaded the van up . Corn , apples , veg , pigs , hens . Everything . Then took the girl . And put some burning straw in the house and that was that . I hid behind the pig trough . Found a car , got here . I went back today , nothing left , - nobody . - ( EXCLAIMS IN PAIN ) - It 's all right . It 's all right . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I thought he was one of them I 'm hungry . I was making scones . I got some eggs . - Eggs ? - Yeah , I picked them up , uh ... There are a couple of hens in a hamper in the car . Come on , let 's go and get them . All right , well , who 's going to find something for a sling ? - No , no , it doesn 't need a sling . - Oh , yes it does . - You can have my scarf . - Thanks , Lizzie . ( HENS CLUCKING ) - Can you sprinkle some corn ? - LINCOLN : Right . They 'll be all right . No , they won 't . They need some water . All right , um , a cup of water . Yes , and when you put it in can you leave the door a couple of inches open ? Oh , for air , right . - How 's it feel ? - Ah , rotten . - Well , have some more aspirin . - No , it 's all right . Just hope it 's clean . - And that water 's boiling , Jen . - Great . Are you all right ? I thought he was one of the British government . That 's why , you know ... Any tranquilisers in there ? No . JENNY : What about that water ? Oh , what water ? - JENNY : For the chickens . - Oh , I 've done it . - Oh . - I 've never killed a chicken , have you ? No . - ABBY : Where are you going to sleep ? - What ? The parlour . Oh , right , the parlour . - I haven 't got any bedding . - We 've none to spare . There 's a hearth rug in there . Put that over you . Oh , I don 't know how old those eggs are . - I found them all over the place . - Oh , well , we 'll go carefully then . Keep your noses out of the way when you break them . - Any egg cups ? - LIZZIE : Here . Boiled eggs and biscuits , what a feast . Did the British government mention any names ? Oh , yes , they did . They came in the name of the Chairman of Britain . I wonder how many groups there are like that . Well , they said they 'd got eaten out by rats , that 's why they needed the stuff . There are giant rats , people at the farm said , and lions and elephants from the safari parks . And giant crows , they 'd seen them from all the corpses . When you were at your farm , did anyone mention some people round here called angels ? Oh , yes , they 're up in the hills . They 're going to come down and judge us all . ( GRUNTS ) ( HENS CLUCKING ) ( DOG GROWLING ) ( FRANTIC CLUCKING ) Are you being wise ? No , but I must go up there and find out for myself . Yes , of course . I 'll be back when you see me . Well , I 'll make tea for Greg . And then we must get some food . And other things . You 'll take me with you ? Greg can look after the children . ( CAR APPROACHING ) Snap Pot ! ( BRAKES SCREECHING ) LIZZIE : Jenny ! Jenny ! JOHN : Jenny ! Jenny ! JENNY : Oh , hello . ( EXCLAIMS ) - You all right ? - Oh , I don 't know . Won 't know till it heals or doesn 't . Well , there 's no fever . Is it still sore ? - Yeah , a bit . - I 'll dress it . - You stocked up ? - Yes . ( CLATTERING ) The bus is chock-a-block . The town is awful . So we detoured and found a village and came in upwind . You should see what our friend Lincoln 's got . I got these from a farm . And cartridges . - May I have a shoot ? - No ! And we got barbed wire . - You got it ? - Barbed wire ? Well , to put around the place . Make a ... What do you call it ... perimeter . ( KNOCKS ON DOOR ) 'Cause they won 't expect it . And if it 's right round the house , they 'll be held up and we can shoot them . - And what do you expect to live on ? - Right . We get more chickens . There must be some more left at that farm . - But how do you expect to catch them ? - With corn . And half a dozen bus loads from that village . And we dig . Now , we 'll have to put the wire further back . By that second lot of trees . That 's better . And we 'll dig up in between and plant . And we can get people in the trees with guns . - What people ? - Oh , we 'll find them . Half a dozen men and women . They must be there in the town . In the country . We haven 't seen anybody in the town or in the country . And water . What are you gonna do about water ? You very cleverly managed to put the barbed wire between us and the stream . ( STUTTERS ) We 'll bring it up in buckets . Fill the bath . ( SIGHS ) Oh , I wonder how my bath water 's doing . We 've got to stop these thugs . They 're not gonna come in the night , are they ? Are they ? Where 's these chemist things ? I used to take these . Before ... - Can I ask something ? - What ? Are you and she ... - Yes . - Oh . Why did you say that ? I thought it might shut him up . JACK : Who 's there ? ABBY : A friend . My name 's Abby Grant . A person . Abby Grant . How are you , Abby Grant ? - I 'm well . - Good . Where have you come from ? - A house about 10 miles away . - A house ? With other persons ? Yes . Two friends , two children and another man . Are you the angels ? ( BOTH LAUGHING ) - ( LAUGHING ) Not yet . Not yet . - Well , that 's what they call you . Angels ? This is Matthew , this is Robert and my name 's Jack . - I know . I read about you . - Recently ? I read about you recently but it was an old newspaper . Ah , yes . There were some reporters with us when we were coming up . - The paper said you had the Word of God . - Oh , we did and do . Always . - How is life down there ? - Strange . Plague has come ? - Yes . - And gone ? Yes . You 're the first person we 've seen . Am I ? What , since you came here ? Well , we knew there were people , because we sometimes see smoke from their fires . Though not many , as God had told us . I wondered if a party of boys had made their way up here . Not yet . - How many people are there still alive ? - Oh , I don 't know . But a man I met put it at 10,000 in Britain . - Are there just the three of you ? - Yes . And God . Did you bring the animals two by two up the mountain ? ( ALL LAUGHING ) No . There are plenty of sheep here already . No . We brought some wood and made a shed . And spades , and forks , and a hose , and seeds , and scissors , and needles and saws . And a few candles . And the Bibles . - What do you live on ? - We work at our cabbage patch . We grow turnips and lettuces and onions and ... And good potatoes . Have you had supper ? - It doesn 't matter . - Don 't it ? Well , I ... I 'm so confused . Would it be possible to talk to you ? And try to clear my mind a little ? ( CHUCKLES ) It would be possible . - Oh , we have a visitor 's room . - Yeah ? The back shed . We could clear a space among the potatoes and cabbages . Would you mind that ? - And my son may turn up . - I hope he will . - Is this where you pray ? - We pray everywhere . This is where we read and think . I 'm not a believer . I can 't be . Hey , you are what you are . ( BEN HOWLING ) What do you want ? Oh , nothing . ( BEN GROWLING ) Abby , come in . Sit down . The Death has took man in his millions . Is that more terrible than one man ? Is it terrible at all ? Well , yes . I 'm human . God has told me what he 's told many humans over thousands of years . Of his glory and majesty and love and compassion . - I don 't understand God . - Oh , to understand God . Abby , who did you love most ? My son , Peter . And my husband . Did you have to understand them before you loved them ? No . Abby , it 's all been written and said . There is nothing new under the sun . God has infinite understanding . " Where wast thou when He laid the foundations of the Earth ? " - I haven 't to ask questions ? - Yes . But love God . Was it because they didn 't love God that so many people were killed ? Were the babies killed because they didn 't know about God ? - What killed them ? - The plague ! The plague has come and gone for thousands of years . And one taken and one left and desolation , as in the book . And God has been compassionate and has comforted . And has wiped away tears from all faces . Life down there , you say , has been reduced to survival level . Is that new ? Half the world was trying to survive before the plague . But nothing 's changed down there . They 're still stupid . Killing , stealing ... Panicking ? Yes . Did you leave civilisation to pray ? - Nothing more ? - God told me to come . He 's kept me safe , and when the time comes , I 'll do his purpose . Abby , don 't be afraid . Our minister delivers who are left of God 's people . And accept whatever my end be . Your son 's name is Peter . It 's a good name . Oh , I 'm not an oracle . Not even an angel . You want to know if he 's alive or dead . If he 's dead , at least I could grieve for him . And if he 's alive , you have a reason to live . I didn 't think I 'd need a reason to live . - I seem to have a will to live . - Yes , we have a will to live . - Did God give us that ? - Yes , he did . To live . To survive . Maybe God is survival . Or survival is God . Who could ascend the mountain of the Lord ? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart . Are you laughing at me ? I have neither . - Oh , I should go . - Abby , you 're truthful . And you 're searching . Please don 't be afraid . ( GATE CREAKING ) ( BEN BARKING ) ( CHILDREN CHATTERING ) - A good haul ? - JENNY : Should keep us going . - How 's the arm ? - GREG : It 's all right . Oh , great . I knew five days would do it . Yeah , there 's one thing though . Driving back here , you can see the whole layout from half a mile off . So it 's not much of a fortress , with your barbed wire or no barbed wire . - What do you mean ? - I mean , it 's a silly place to stay . - Careful of your arm . - Ah , it 's fine . - Why unpack then ? - Because we ought to talk about it . - Oh , let 's talk ... - Come on ! - I 'm not saying we should leave at once . - Yes , you are . Look , I only noticed the damn thing five minutes ago . So , if the British government comes , we 're for it ! - You had your pill this morning ? - What 's that to you ? - Oh , go on ... - You and she want to get off , that 's it ! - No , we don 't . - Well , go on then , go ! Now , listen ! Now , this place isn 't right . You haven 't caught any more chickens , you haven 't got any more people . You haven 't dug an inch , you don 't even know what the soil 's like . There is no well . Now , I 'm telling you , this place isn 't right . Well , go then ! All right , kids , get your sleeping bags . What about Abby ? Oh , we 'll leave a note for her just in case she comes back while we 're looking for her . - You coming ? - Oh , sure . LIZZIE : Come on . JOHN : He 's a slowly worm . Here , you take this . I 've left my hat . Right . Right , then , she 's not leaving . Go on ! Go on , then . ( BARKING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GROWLING ) Ben ! Ben . Right here . Come on , Ben . Here . LINCOLN : Don 't leave me . - We 'll have to take him . - No ! No ! No , no ! Don 't leave me . Come on . GREG : Abby ! - That 's Greg . - Oh . LIZZIE : Abby ! JOHN : Abby ! LIZZIE : Abby ! JOHN : Abby ! ABBY : ( LAUGHING ) Hello ! Hello . And Greg , Jenny . Hello . - ( GRUNTS ) Right . Time for bed . - No , it isn 't . - Oh , yes , it is . - No ! Oh , that 's my side . Hurry up . - No , it isn 't ! - Night , night . ( SNORING ) Come on , Matthew . Wake up . ( GRUNTS ) - Is it morning ? - Yes , of course it is . - Breakfast time ? - Yes ! Oh , right . Goody , goody ! All right , come on . Wash your face first . Lots of water . Come on . More . There we go . Right . You sit down there . And I 'll sit here . Now then , what 's for breakfast ? ( CLICKS TONGUE ) Um ... Onions . - Onions ? - Yes . - Where do I get onions from ? - A tree , of course . Oh . - What did you do that for ? - It was a bad onion . - Can you fly ? - No . - But angels can fly . - I 'm not an angel , John . I thought you were . Can you do miracles ? Little miracles . We can all do those . Like being kind when we feel angry . - That isn 't a miracle . - Can you do it ? It 's very difficult . ( LIZZIE SQUEALING ) ( MATTHEW BARKING ) It 's just that we don 't want to put you to any sort of trouble . - I 'd like to stay on if I may . - You may . Oh , we 've room upstairs . We 'll make a partition . - We 've got timber ? - Yes , we have . Would you believe it ? I was a carpenter . Now then , here 's an onion that isn 't bad . ( LIZZIE SQUEALING ) - How do you dig without a tractor ? - With a spade , John . - How do you light the fire ? - With a match . What 'll you do when all the matches are burnt ? We 'll light a fire that doesn 't go out . ( EXHALING ) The children are staying , aren 't they ? - Do you want to stay ? - Yes . - Yes ! - Hey ! - Are you all right ? - Yes . Fine . ( MATTHEW BARKING ) ( GASPING ) It must be glandular . We 've been well all the time we 've been here . ABBY : Robert ? It 's a lumpy feeling . A bit of fever . Yes , well , you better go to bed . - You brought some illness with you . - We were all well . You were carrying it . It must have been you . It happens . Are you all right ? Well , how much longer , then ? One more day . And another one after that and another one . - We can 't leave them , John , can we ? - Oh , let 's play cards , then . - Is it all right to play cards here ? - Yes . John , Lizzie , it 's fine out there . Go out and play . Come on . Oh , come on , John . We brought it with us . Or at least I did . They wouldn 't have been tired if it had come from you two . Does it matter who ? We can all be carriers . Anyone who 's had the plague is probably a carrier , - infecting anyone who hasn 't had it . - Maybe . But I know that I infected them . What happens when we meet someone on an island ? Or someone in the middle of Australia who 's never had the plague ? We kill them . I always thought that there might be a bit of civilisation left still intact . People with everything going for them . Yeah , so we all just have to keep clear . Not get in touch with them . If they exist . Who 's to say they exist ? Peter might exist . What about him ? On his way here . What if he hasn 't had it ? There he is . Hello , Lizzie . John . - Are you feeling any better ? - No . LIZZIE : Where 's Matthew ? JACK : Lizzie . Matthew ? It 's the plague . You 're like my uncle . And my grandmother . You 'll be dead soon . Goodbye . ABBY : John ? Lizzie ? Do you want me to read to you ? God called me . Saved me . And killed me . I ... love ... God . - Best get your coats on . - What about Abby ? She 'll come soon . Yeah . We 'll go down to the bus and wait for her there . Get it ready for her . Come on . ABBY : " As for man , his days are as grass . " As a flower of the field , so he flourisheth .

 You have guessed , haven 't you ? What ? The door , whose idea it was . No , you tell me . Well , our host , His Lordship , of course . 'What 's behind it ? ' He 's got a special device . He 's the only person who knows how to use it . ( Sapphire ) ' Something moving . ' ( Steel ) ' Tell me . ' 'It 's twisting , turning ... and writhing . - ' It 's ... ( Gasps ) ' - More champagne ? 'Come back , Sapphire . Sapphire ! ' 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' 'Do you hear me ? Come back ! ' The door interests you ? Ah , Arthur , the very man . He 'll explain all . Excuse me . Yes , I see it has no handle . No lock . It 's a security door , that 's all . It leads to my office . The heart of Mullrine International . The nerve centre , you might say . - How fascinating . - Not really , just something I ... - ( Doorbell ) - This time it must be Tony Purnell . You will excuse me , won 't you ? It 's behind the door . A feeling of euphoria . - What ? - A sense of success , achievement . - Nothing evil ? - No ! Something wonderful happened in there . I say , who 's Tony Purnell ? - One of our merchant bankers . - Ah , thank you . Not at all . I 'm Felix Harborough . - Of Mullrine International . - Hole in one . Hello , Jenkins . Look after these , will you ? How 's the back ? Come on , dear . Greville , how are you ? Where 's himself ? Hello , sir , I 'm awfully sorry if we 're a bit late . Oh , dear . Your clothes ! It won 't take us a second to change . Yes , I can do it in a jiffy . Veronica Blamey , Lord Mullrine . - How do you do ? - Maybe a quick drink ? You can 't go in there like that ! I mean , it 's all wrong ! I mean , damn it , Tony . The instructions were detailed in the invitation . - Yes , I 'm sorry . - Greville , take them to their rooms . Don 't let them down until they 've changed . - I 'm sorry ... - This way , please , miss . Are you expecting anyone else ? It 's getting dark . And there 's a thick fog coming up . - In June ? - Funny , isn 't it ? Rather spooky , actually . ( Greville and Tony ) # Oh , oh , oh , what a girl # There 's none so classy as my fair lassie ... # ( Tony ) Greville , there 's no power point for my electric razor . - Power point , sir ? - Oh , I 've got to call London . - Does that thing work ? - Yes , sir . - There 's no dial on it . - It 's a country exchange . If you lift the receiver , the operator will get you your number . ( Chuckles ) I didn 't think there were any left . - I ought to have a shave . - I 'll lay out your safety razor . - Safety razor ? Oh , hello ? - ' Number please . ' Yes , can you get me a London number ? Yes , it 's 012468021 . What do you mean " which exchange " ? London . That 's the number . ( Humming happily ) Oh ! ( Laughs ) Oh , the exchange ! Now , what was Dad 's old number at the bank ? Temple Bar , Chancery , London Wall ... No , it 's gone . Anyway , just get it , will you ? Come on , don 't milk the joke , love , I 've got to make this call . I think His Lordship 's taking this joke a bit far , don 't you ? Pardon , sir ? What the hell 's this ? Where 's my electric razor ? Electric , sir ? Rather dangerous , I would have thought . These aren 't mine ! I just hired the tails . They came out of your suitcase , sir . If you need anything else , please ring . The remainder of the guests are in the lounge . Dinner will be at nine . Damn cheek . So what have they done with all my gear ? - ( Knock at door ) - Come ! - Tony ? - What ? - Well , look . - Oh , yes ! They swapped all my clothes and my make-up . Everything 's really old ! You should see my nightie . It 's peach-coloured crepe de Chine . And look at these . ( Chuckles ) Pure silk , fully fashioned . All the rage . In 1930 . Come in , you two . Now that 's better , I must say . - Tony , dear boy . - Miss Emma . You are naughty , it 's ages since we saw you last . And who is this charming young woman ? - Veronica Blamey . - Hello , adorable child . Come and meet people . Ah , you two , this is , er , Tony Purnell , Veronica Blamey and ... - Virginia Cavendish . - Miles . Exactly ! Greville . Some drinks , please . - I understand you 're a banker ? - Born and bred . Don 't you find money awfully tedious ? - It has its uses . - ' A year older than her - ' born in Maidenhead , rich family . ' - We 've met before . Really ? I wonder where it was . - Last season somewhere ? - Oh , then it must have been ... 'She 's 24 , in love , not very bright , born in Barnes . ' - Cowes ? - No . Oh . Henley , perhaps ? 'He doesn 't feel the same way . He has someone else . ' No , not Henley . Give me time , I 'll remember . Hello , I 'm Felix Harborough . Would you care to dance ? Oh ! Well , if Tony doesn 't mind . No , of course not . - Shall we ? - Thank you . What 's it to be ? The Charleston ? Black Bottom ? Old hat , my dear . This is 1930 , you know . - Foxtrot . - Of course . ( # Big band ) ( Miss Shaw ) Yes , yes , I know it 's urgent , Mr Fairfax , but my orders from Lord Mullrine were specific - he is not to be disturbed . No , I 'm sorry , his party isn 't to be interrupted under any circumstances . Yes , he was in the office just three minutes ago . All right , all right , let me look into the drawing room and if his guests haven 't arrived I 'll talk to him . ( Controller clicks ) ( Clicks ) How very odd . ( Sighs ) Mr Fairfax ? Look , I 'm awfully sorry but the , er , security device that opens the door isn 't working . ( Sighs ) No , I 've no idea how to mend it . It 's probably the batteries . We 'll have to leave it for now but I 'll give Lord Mullrine your message as soon as I see him . All right , goodbye . Lovely ! So lovely ! - ' It 's here , Steel . ' - ' In this room ? ' 'Yes . No ... All around us . ' Your attention please , ladies and gentlemen . Shh ! No birthday party is complete without a birthday cake . And as this is a very special birthday party Mullrine International provides a very special cake commemorating 50 years of achievement and splendid growth . ( Sapphire ) ' Pressure . You feel it ? ' ( Steel ) ' No . ' I think it would be rather nice if we invited the youngest here tonight to cut the cake . ( All mutter in agreement ) I think that must be me . It isn 't Miss Emma , is it ( ? ) - It certainly is not ! - I don 't think I can ! ( Howard ) Pretend it 's your wedding cake . - ( Felix ) Who 's the lucky man ? - Jolly good , then . - When do we eat it ? - After dinner , with the coffee . But first ... I would like you all to raise your glasses in a toast . Mullrine International ! No , no , no , not to Mullrine International , to the memory of one who , as my sister has pointed out more than once tonight , is gone from us . To my old partner ... No , my old friend ... To George McDee ! 'Steel ! ' - ( All ) George McDee ! - ( Rushing wind ) Oh , the cake ! ( Gasps ) ( Man ) Good evening , everyone ! I hope I 'm not late . George ! George ... - About time too . - What are you talking about , woman ? You ! You 're late as usual . Let 's have a look at you . It can 't be . It can 't be ! Arthur 's really pulled one off this time . - What are you doing ? - What I always have to do . - You can never tie a bow properly . - How dare you ? ( Steel ) ' Who is he ? ' ( Sapphire ) ' He 's Mullrine 's partner . ' ( Steel ) ' Was . ' ( Sapphire ) ' No , he 's not a ghost . ' Arthur , is this your idea of a joke ? No . No , I ... I don 't understand . It 's him ! Nonsense , but it 's a remarkable likeness . ( Annabelle ) Fascinating . ( Tony ) What ? George , I always have to straighten your tie . I 've never set eyes on you in my life . George , it 's me , Felicity , your wife . ( Sapphire ) ' He 's alive . He 's due to die on 22nd June , 1930 . ' Grandmama . Woman , stop your ramblings . You 're 50 years too old to be my wife ! - Oh ! - 50 years at the very least . Arthur , tell him ! - ' 22nd of June ? That 's tomorrow . ' - ' Yes . ' I don 't know what you 're playing at but you should apologise to Felicity . - Oh ! - Come on ... ( Sobbing ) Is everybody mad here ? What 's going on ? - That 's what I want to know . - Is she a loony ? Greville , a whisky for Mrs McDee . Mrs McDee , is it ? Bring me a large dram , I 've a feeling I 'm going to need it . Excuse me , sir . Malcolm , can you explain what 's going on here ? - Malcolm ? - Do you not know your own name ? Grandmama , what is he talking about ? - Grandmama , is it ? - Yes . - She 's no grandmama of yours . - How would you know ? Young man , remember who it is you 're addressing . I 'd be delighted if I knew who you were . - Do you not know your own father ? - My father 's dead . ( Steel ) ' He must be the image of his father . ' Malcolm , what are you saying ? Malcolm ? I 'm not Malcolm , that was my father 's name . I 'm Howard . ( Sapphire ) ' What do we do ? ' ( Steel ) ' Nothing , yet . 'Not until we find out which one is being used . ' Where 's Arthur ? This has all the marks of one of his stunts . - Where 's Mr Mullrine ? - Lord Mullrine ... is there , sir . Lord Mullrine , is it ? Well , whoever you may be I 've no time for party games tonight . I 've important work to see to . Bring me that dram in my laboratory . Flappers . Nae wonder we 've a slump coming ! ( Felix ) Congratulations , Arthur . Splendid ! ( Howard ) I thought it was in very bad taste . The door ... Something odd . There 's something ... something I ought to remember ! ( Felicity sobbing ) - Something wrong ? - There , there , Felicity . These men , they 'll never change . Mrs McDee might benefit from a little rest . Come along . Now , you 've had rather a nasty shock . We 'll get you up to your bedroom , you 'll be fine . Don 't upset yourself , come on ... No consideration . You mark my words , Arthur , he 'll shut himself away in that laboratory again and we shan 't see him for the rest of the evening . - Poor Felicity . - Poor Felicity indeed . Don 't be such a hypocrite , Emma , it doesn 't become you . Come on everybody , drink up , this is supposed to be a party ! ( Annabelle ) I 'd love one . ( Arthur ) Fresh champagne ... - Splendid . - Well , which one ? I don 't know . I 've been trying but something 's stopping me . - Then it knows about us . - It always does . - There you are , Grandmama . - Thank you , dear . Will you please undo this one ? I shall be quite all right now . - Sure ? You 've had a nasty shock . - Oh no , I was just a little tired . Long journeys always tire me . - Long journeys ? - Yes . Now , please don 't fuss . No . No , I won 't . I 'm certain something happened . I 'm sure ... I shall come down to dinner in half an hour , so off you go . We don 't want to spoil things , do we ? - No . No , we don 't . - That 's right . Run along , Malcolm . ( Shoes creaking ) # Dee-dum , da-da dee-dum ... # Da-dee ... # Tony deserting you , my dear ? We can 't have that , can we ? Pretty girl like you . Thank you . Don 't let this house get you down . Arthur 's pretty soft really . - I 'll try to remember that . - You , er ... known Tony long ? - No , I ... - How long ? I can 't remember . I don 't know , I ... - Oh , dear . - Takes after his father , I 'm afraid . You met Malcolm yet ? I 've known him since I was in nappies . Malcolm ? Tony says I 'd make a good actress . I think I 'd like that . Oh ... What have your long-suffering parents to say about that ? I ... I don 't know . Rather irregular existence . I prefer to know where the next Range Rover 's coming from . Tony says ... Tony ... says ... Now , now , this will never do , this is supposed to be a party ! I think we should play an exciting game before dinner . - Oh , no , Emma ! - Arthur , we always play games ! - What 's it going to be ? - Not Postman 's Knock this time ! I know ! Sardines ! - Sardines ? Where are the bounds ? - All over the house . ( Shoes creaking ) - Greville , how much longer ? - 60 seconds to go , Miss Emma . - 59 ... - ( All ) 58 , 57 ... What about Felicity 's room ? It 's out of bounds . So is the grandfather clock . Somebody hid in it last time and it hasn 't worked since ! ( Annabelle ) Hide in it , darling , it may start up again . ( Emma ) Not too much naughtiness ! - There you are , Malcolm . - I 'm not Malcolm . Never mind . Come and join the game , we 're playing Sardines . Such fun ! And we 've time for just one go before dinner . How much longer ? 35 seconds , Miss Emma . - 34 ... - ( All ) 33 ... ( Annabelle ) What 's " too much naughtiness " ? What a lot of ridiculous tomfoolery . Nonsense , you 've always adored playing Sardines . At Bertie 's last month you couldn 't wait to play ! Perhaps because Maisie Hamilton was there ? I 've had nothing to do with Maisie Hamilton . Come along , that 's a bit hot . - We 'll let Veronica hide , Malcolm . - I 'm not Malcolm . - How long has she got ? - 15 seconds to go . 14 ... ( All ) 13 ... ( Steel ) ' Do we have to join in ? ' ( Sapphire ) ' Of course . It might be fun . If we don 't cheat . ' ( Steel ) ' I 'm gonna look around . ' Four , three , two , - one ... - ( Greville ) Time ! ( All ) Coming ! ( Hushed conversation ) Well , if you 'll forgive me . ( Door creaks ) Coo-ee ! Is anybody there ? I know you 're there somewhere . Veronica ? Veronica , are you there ? It 's me . Veronica ? ( Door creaks ) ( Gasps ) I thought you weren 't joining in ? Cheap fiction , romantic novels and those . " Physics And Chemistry Of Surfaces , The Theory Of Elastic Stability " ... It 's a pretty mixed bunch . And I found this . - What is it ? - A book on local history . - Useful ? - Possibly . ( Surge of energy ) ( Gasps ) Aha , found you ! Anyone else in there with you ? Don 't be silly . ( Screams )

 - We are receiving a signal . - What is it ? ' .. over . ' 'Roger . ' 'She 's an orbiting killer capable of destroying all our ships . ' - Who picked you for this mission ? - I did . - You just don 't understand , do you ? - Yes , I do understand ! We haven 't tangled with a base star since we fled . - Can we just drop this ? - No ! You have the corner on loneliness ? Launch all vipers . Come on , let 's go ! Hey , would ... would you hurry up ? Apollo , is this your idea of a fun evening ? You gotta speak up ! I can 't hear you ! Come on . Up you go . Starbuck . Where in heaven 's name are we ? As high as you can get on the Galactica . We 're directly over the main thrusters . It 's a great spot to get away and think . A cosy little place like this could be used for more than thinking . Starbuck . - Are you ready ? - For what ? Watch . - This is incredible ! - It 's frightening . Don 't worry , we 're perfectly safe . The bubble 's constructed of tylinium . It 's a lot different from a viper cockpit . - It 's so open . - It 's like riding in the hand of God . At least that 's the way I like to think of it . You like it , Sheba ? Oh , Apollo , I love it ! Get up here and try it . Come on . Apollo , what was this bubble used for ? It 's a celestial chamber . The only one left on the Galactica . When she was launched over 500 yahren ago , there were a number of these domes . Navigators used to come up here to take star sightings , to double-check the navigation computer . I doubt anyone 's been here except us in a hundred yahren or more . - All these instruments seem to work . - I repaired the ones that didn 't . I like shooting the stars the way my ancestors did . I get the feeling you 'd have loved living in the past , knocking around some planetary system in an old sub-light rocket . It may have been slow but it was more of a challenge . Living back then might 've been more fun . What 's this set for ? Long-range communications . Only you won 't get anything on it . Those frequencies are outdated . We don 't use them now . - Somebody does . - What ? It 's very weak but we are receiving a signal . - What is it ? - I can 't tell . I 'm trying to get a directional fix . We 're losing it . It 's gone . Any idea where it came from ? Well ... it looked like a ship but it wasn 't like any one I 've ever seen . I have . On our history scans . It looked like something the Colonies used to fly ... a couple of thousand yahrens ago . - Boomer . - Mm ? - Boomer , wake up . - Mm . Oh . Apollo . I 'd just met this beautiful girl and I was about to ... What 's going on ? - Boomer , we need your help . - I need sleep . You 're a whizz at long-range communications . Dr. Wilker 's better . - But Dr. Wilker 's on the electronics ship . - Good for him . We picked up a transmission on a gamma frequency . Good for you . - On a what ? - A gamma frequency . - Gamma ? ! - Shh . Sh ! That frequency 's ancient . - Interesting , huh ? - Might be . - Did you record it ? - Right here . Why didn 't you say so ? Erm , Boomer , are you going to go to the lab looking like that ? Huh ? No . It 's some sort of spacecraft . Can you enhance the signal ? Maybe Wilker can with the computer . The best I can do is clear up the audio . ' .. go . ' - ' Go ... ' - ' Eagle ... ' ' .. ignition , 10 % . ' - ' .. on time . ' - ' Roger . ' 'Go for LOl ... ' 'Roger . ' Afraid that 's it . Do you know where it 's coming from ? It could be a harmonic signal , a doubling of the original frequency . It 's one of the reasons we don 't use those old frequencies any more . If it is a harmonic , its origins could be relatively close . And if it 's not ? If that 's a primary frequency , it 's come a long way to be that weak . It 's probably intergalactic . Intergalactic ? Then we 've picked up something that could 've been transmitted a hundred yahrens ago . Or a thousand or 10,000 . There 's no telling how long that signal 's been travelling . You mean we could be looking at something from the past ? Quite possibly . I wonder whose ? I could only guess but let 's check out Boomer 's theory that it 's a harmonic signal from something close by . - Did you get a position fix ? - As near as we can compute , it came in through this quadrant , something like this . Colonel Tigh , concentrated scan , please . Concentrated scan . Star quadrant Epsilon 7 ... - mark four . - Yes , sir . I 'd forgotten all about that celestial dome topside . What were you four doing up there ? Just taking in the view , Commander . Oh . Sir , the only area of interest in that quadrant is a solar system on the edge of our scanners . Right on the line of transmission . It may be a harmonic signal . - Maybe . - Any life forms ? Too far for that data , sir . We 're barely picking up planets . Apollo , take a patrol into that quadrant . - See if you can find the source . - Yes , sir . Boomer , work on that recording until Dr. Wilker returns . Yes , sir . What were you doing in that dome ? Colonel ! Five planets , fairly widespread orbits . I got ' em . I 'm not scanning any life forms . Neither am I but we 're still a long way off . Let 's split up and take a look at the first three . The first planet 's a giant . 80 % compressed hydrogen , 12 % helium , no life forms . But it sure is pretty . So 's number two . Beautiful but deadly . The atmosphere is mostly compressed carbon dioxide . No life forms . Leave it to me to get the ugly one . No atmosphere , just barren rock . No life could possib ... Wait ! What is it ? I 'm picking up something . Just rising on the back side of the planet . - Oh , no . No ! - Starbuck ? Get out of here , it 's a Cylon base star ! - I thought we 'd lost them for good . - We all did . - You weren 't detected ? - I left before they reached orbit . - Sheba and I were blocked by the planets . - Thank God for that . Stay on it , Omega . We 're too far out to pick up the base star on our scanners but nothing has left that system except our patrol . Good , then they can 't scan us either . They picked a great spot to lay a trap , sir . That system is on the very rim of the galaxy . We 'll have to backtrack a long way to get around her without being detected . They 're aware of that . That 's why they 're sitting where they are . Apollo . That transmission you picked up ... they 're enticing us in . You think it came from that base star ? I think that most likely . It 's an elaborate lure . Precisely what I 'd expect from the Cylons . - I 'm not so sure . - What are we going to do ? There 's nothing we can do but turn back . There must be another way . Yes , there is . We can attack . Adama , we haven 't tangled with a base star since we fled . My father did . Yes , he did . And he hasn 't been heard from since . But Cain attacked two base stars . We 'd be taking on only one . Obviously , they 've spread out through all the star systems in order to find us . And this base star may be the only one in this galaxy . Tigh , do you realise this is the first time since we fled the Colonies that we have the advantage ? But even if we didn 't have the advantage , I 'm tired of running . Adama ... so am I. Then let 's take her on . - Have we achieved orbit ? - Insertion 10 centons ago . - Long-range scan ? - Fully operational , nothing definite to report . - Definite ? - A momentary blip prior to achieving orbit . Our scanners were not fully operational . - Nothing since ? - No . Launch a fighter patrol to circumnavigate this planetary system , just to be safe . By your command . Duty patrol to the launch bay . She has 300 fighters , carries two long-range megapulsars - here and here - and over a hundred laser turrets . She 's an orbiting killer capable of destroying all our ships , including the Galactica . That 's what I like about the Colonel - his optimism . We do have one advantage - the element of surprise . And I intend to make the most of it . All vipers will be launched before the Galactica is within their scanning range . Your job is to draw out their fighters . You 'll be outnumbered two to one but you 're used to that . - Better odds than we had on Caprica . - We lost at Caprica . I intend to bring the Galactica in at an arc , come in past the sun from the opposite direction . If we 're lucky , the base star will be so occupied watching you that we 'll be on her before she 's aware of us and we 'll get in the first strike . After that , it 's a toe-to-toe slugging match . Well , that 's it . Thank you . And good luck . Colonel . Squadron assembly at 1750 , launch 1800 . The Officers ' Club will be open to all warriors , regardless of rank , for one centare and one drink - on the Commander . Commencing now . If the Commander 's buying , I 'm drinking . If anybody 's buying you 're drinking . Apollo , are you coming ? In a bit . I should know better than to ask but what is it ? - I was just thinking . - That 's what I was afraid of . If we could find some way to knock out her control centre scanners , the Galactica would get in the first strike . - Terrific idea . You wanna tell me how ? - I don 't know ... Right . Let 's go get a drink . .. but it would have to be from the inside . Oh , sure . All you have to do is fly through a hundred fighters , land on the base star , find her control centre , blow it up and take off again . Simple . - You 're right . - Of course I 'm right . Apollo . No . No , we could do it if we used Baltar 's Cylon fighter . But ... No . It guarantees the Galactica getting in the first strike . - You know that 's the key to victory . - Of course I do . But suppose you did get inside , then what ? What 's their security like in the landing bay ? How many Centurions are there between you and the control centre ? Where is the control centre ? Starbuck , erm ... When Baltar captured you , you saw his base star . He knows . They didn 't exactly give me the grand tour . Er , I do know the central core leads to all decks but I have no idea where Control Centre is . Make an educated guess . You know ... I think your plan will work . It will ? Bridge , Commander Adama . Launch a shuttle immediately to the prison barge , with orders to bring Baltar back to my quarters . Baltar ? You really think he 'll help us ? He just may . Our patrol has passed the outer planets and found nothing . Order them to continue into the galaxy as long as fuel permits . Enter . Remove his shackles and wait outside . Toys , Adama ? Would you like a drink ? What do you want ? Information . They 've found you ! We 've found them . It 's the same thing . We 're going to destroy them . Destroy them ? A base star ? Not likely . With your help . Why would I possibly help you ? To regain your freedom . You 're taunting me . I 'm offering you freedom in exchange for information . And how do you define freedom ? We 've been passing a number of habitable planets . I intend to set you on one ... with adequate provisions and shelter . Marooned . It 's better than the prison barge . Communications ? No . Even a marooned man must have some hope of eventual rescue . Very well . But only short-range communication . And when am I to be set free ? After the base star has been destroyed . What if they destroy you and me along with you ? That 's the risk you 'll have to take . Do we have an agreement ? When you get done and fly out of there , we don 't want to confuse you with the other Cylon fighters - so I rigged this . - What is it ? It 's an ID transmitter set to our attack frequency . If one of us comes up on your tail , we get a flashing red dot on our attack scanner . So even though we may think about it , we won 't blow you out of the sky . - You sure it 'll work ? - It 'll work . Thanks , Boomer . Did Dr. Wilker get a chance to enhance that transmission ? - Not yet . - You think it wasn 't from the base star ? I don 't know . I got a funny feeling it wasn 't . Starbuck , could I have a word with you ? Please ? It 's getting a little crowded in here . I 'll go and find Wilker . - Yeah , Cass ? - Alone . Excuse me for a centon . It takes three Cylons to fly this fighter . Uh-uh . I need you and Boomer to lead the squadrons . Besides , the third Cylon just sits right there and gives orders . Very well , then . - Who picked you for this mission ? - I did . You really want to get yourself killed , don 't you ? What 's that supposed to mean ? Ever since you lost Serina , you 've taken every high-risk mission . Serina has nothing to do with it . She was a very lovely woman , Apollo ... but she 's dead . - Can we just drop this ? - No ! You have the corner on loneliness ? I 'm sorry . It 's all right . I guess we 've been at each other 's throats ever since we met . Yeah , I guess we have . Except for lately . You 've included me in your tight little circle of friends and I appreciate that . Yeah , well ... I realised I 'd been a little hard on you . Did you ever think about the fact that ... maybe two people who snap at each other for no reason are doing it to avoid their real feelings ? I 've thought about it quite a bit . Be careful . So why does it always have to be you ? Apollo 's going . I 'm not in love with Apollo ! Cass , you know me , I 'll make it . Knowing you , you 'll find some beautiful female prisoner to rescue ! That 's crazy . Starbuck . Good luck , hotshot . Has everyone gone crazy ? - You just don 't understand , do you ? - Yes , I do understand ! I just don 't see the sense of dwelling on what might go wrong . It 's a lousy way to live . I 'll be back . I promise . If you 're not ... I 'm gonna kill you . - Are your timers set ? - I have one centon delay . Whatever you do , don 't lose that transmitter . It 's the only way we can tell you from the Cylons . If we do , we 'll just waggle our wings . You would . Hey . I 've never seen you fuss so much . Well , I guess I would feel better if I were going . We need you to lead the squadron . It doesn 't change the way I feel . Good luck . Captain , Lieutenant , I 'm at your disposal . What will happen when we land without clearance ? Probably nothing . They 'll assume you had a communications breakdown . If they don 't have any ships in the air , a Centurion will check who you are . I know where to enter the central core but where 's the control centre ? At the bottom of the core . There 's always a Centurion on guard at the entry hatch . Eliminate him and you 'll be in the computer banks . You won 't need the control room . Blowing up those computers will blind the base star . How much resistance can we expect in the core area ? That depends on how many Centurions are passing through it . There 's only one guard , as I said . Well , that 's it . Starbuck . Apollo . See you soon . Good luck . Well , if they don 't succeed , I die too . You know how to fly this thing ? I thought you did . Ready . Launch . They 're gone . So soon . Why did I ever have to fall in love with a warrior ? I don 't know . They 're penetrating the solar system now , sir . Anything ? I 'm having trouble with this scanner , all I get is blips . Maybe I need a Cylon co-pilot . - Starbuck ! - Holy frack ! Apollo ! They 're all around us . - You think they 're on to us ? - I don 't think so . We must have flown into the middle of a patrol . I hope they think we 're a stray joining back up . Apollo . We 'll soon know if they 're on to us or not . The patrol has landed . No activity in the system . 1750 , Commander . Now . Pilots to launch bay . 'Pilots , man your vipers ! ' Let 's go ! Commander , all squadrons ready to launch . Launch all vipers . 'Squadrons , you are cleared to launch . ' Commander , all squadrons launched . Bring her around to mark Delta 5 . - Full scan . - Mark Delta 5 . Executing . That 's the last of them . Right . - Let 's go . - OK . That 's the hatch to the central core . Let 's go . - If he looks up ... - Yeah . Starbuck ! Set the charges , I 'll cover you . There 's nothing but planets so far . The base star was behind the third planet . Right . We hold this heading . Pull those Cylon fighters to us . Vipers bearing Omega 7 . - Vipers ? - Confirmed . Two squadrons . Launch all fighters to intercept . Scan for the Galactica . By your command . - They must 've spotted our vipers . - Just one more ! Let 's go ! The transmitter ! Let it go ! Without that , the squadron can 't tell us from the Cylons ! Forget it ! We don 't need that felgercarb . We 'll think of something ! The Galactica should be attacking any micron . Then what are we waiting for ? Here they come ! Break ! Commander , long-range scan indicates our squadrons are engaged . - Give it to me here . - Yes , sir . - They 're outnumbered . - They can hold their own . All we need now is to ... There ! There she is , Tigh ! - The base star ? - Yes ! Let 's pray Apollo and Starbuck have knocked out her scanners . - Battle stations ! - Yes , sir . Battle stations ! Seal all compartments ! All units assume ... I don 't think she 's scanned us , sir . We might just have done it , Tigh . Stand by to fire . Fire ! - What happened ? - Aft laser turrets report attacking battlestar . Fire aft mega lasers . Bring us around to Delta 1-5 . Fire port lasers as she comes to bear . Coming around , sir . There 's no red dot . Forward lasers lock on . - Locked . - Fire ! - You did it ! - We all did it , we all did it ! Damage report . Extensive but controllable , and landing bays are intact . Thank God . Recall all vipers . I 'm getting a recall signal . Break off ! We 're going home . - They 're not following . - I think they 've had it . Has anyone picked up Apollo and Starbuck on their scanner ? Do you think ... They 're probably already back having a cool one in the Officers ' Club . Nothing . Not a sign of them . We 've had no Cylon fighters transmitting the identification signal . What if they never got off that base star ? - Commander , Cylon fighter approaching . - Transfer to my console . - Maybe that 's them . - Switch to attack computer frequency . No flashing red dot . Activate laser guns . No , sir , don 't fire , it 's them . How do you know ? They 're waggling ! Waggling ? - Just keep waggling , buddy . - Yeah . Told you we didn 't need that electronic felgercarb . A-ha . I thought I 'd find you up here . Hey , Starbuck . Everyone 's looking for you at the victory celebration . I , er ... I think they 're going to give us a medal . I 'll be there . You still don 't think that transmission was a lure , do you ? No . Only now we 'll never know . Wilker 's lab was destroyed in the battle and the recording with it . So you 're waiting here for another transmission . Yeah . Boomer rigged a gamma signal booster . If anything 's out there , I should pick it up . You think it came from Earth , don 't you ? I hope it did . Our first contact should be her transmission , something similar to what we saw . Just looked like an old spacecraft on a routine run to me . What would you expect , a momentous message ? No , we 'll just pick up routine radio or video scans , nothing extraordinary - to them , anyway . Come on , buddy . Let 's join the celebration . If Earth 's out there , we 'll find it without you holding vigil . Yeah , I guess you 're right . They 're really gonna give us a medal ? Did I say us ? I think they 're just decorating me ! '300 feet , down three and a half . '47 forward . '50 down and two and a half . '19 forward . '100 feet , three and a half down . Nine forward . '40 feet down , two and a half . 'Kicking up some dust . Faint shadow . ' 'We copy you down , Eagle . ' 'Tranquillity Base here . 'The Eagle has landed .

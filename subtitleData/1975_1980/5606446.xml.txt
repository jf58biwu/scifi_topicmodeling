 I was on call , driving to a mountain lodge called " The Dead Mountaineer 's Hotel " and it was quite a difficult drive . THE DEAD MOUNTAINEER 'S HOTEL Many years have passed now , but on dull shifts or sleepless nights , I often recall what happened , and even now I cannot decide whether I was right or not . What 's strange is I can tell no one how it actually happened , not my wife , friends or the authorities . Only I know the whole truth . That 's the mountaineer . He was caught in an avalanche . He was carried 500 meters to his death . Hello ! - Welcome ! I am Alex Snewahr , owner of the hotel , the valley and surrounding mountains . Lell , loyal friend of the deceased . I 'm police inspector Peter Glebsky . What happened here ? Sorry ? - You called the police . - Me ? Hello , captain , this is Glebsky . Nothing 's going on here ... Yes , false alarm . What ? No , I can 't come back today . There is fog in the mountains . What ? Ah , wine ? Well , OK . I understand that one of my guests ... Yes , it must have been . - My sincere apologies . It 's OK . I 'd be happy to spend the night and try your famous " Edelweiss " . My wine cellars are at your command ! Lell ! Room seven ! Great flying , wasn 't it ? - Yes . Well ? Thanks , Lell , you can go now . What beauties you have here ! Just like Hollywood ... Hi . Yes , it 's beautiful here ! I am ... Peter Glebsky , police inspector . Hinckus . Nice to meet you . I just arrived . Been here long ? I have tuberculosis . I need fresh air , doctors tell me . I 'm sorry . Is that the dinner bell ? Are you coming ? I 'll make it . What are you doing up there ? Need help ? I 'm Simon Simonet , commander of the cyber-forces . Funny , isn 't it ? At ease . Police inspector Peter Glebsky . I am actually a physicist . Four years without a vacation . Project Midas . Heard of it ? Top secret . - Yes . I 'm here to climb . But there 's too much snow . So I climb - the walls . The doctors prescribed sensory pleasures . May I present Inspector Glebsky . This is my distant relative , Brun . Next to her is Olaf Andvarafors . How do you do . Mrs. Moses . I love policemen ! Heroes , daredevils ... Are you a daredevil , inspector ? Alas , I am a common police officer . Can 't be . A man of such looks cannot be anything but a daredevil . Oh , really ? How do you do , gentlemen . Mr. Moses , I present our guest inspector Glebsky . - My pleasure . Mr. Moses . We were talking about aliens . I completely share Mr. Däniken 's opinion , that aliens have repeatedly visited Earth Your Däniken is a charlatan . You are a physicist , Simonet , meaning you are a rationalist . But this question is the stuff of poetry . Inspector , what do you think ? I 'm a strong rationalist . I 'm a policeman Everything around me - pleasant hotel , nice owner , somewhat strange guests and amazingly beautiful mountains , everything boded for a pleasant evening . I felt grateful to the captain who sent me . Mr. Inspector , you are a real man . Give Olaf a beating ! Ah , Olaf , the police will make mincemeat out of you Mincemeat is food . Then he will make food from you ! Why ? - To eat ! But we just had dinner . It 's impossible to talk to you ... Why ? It was a very good conversation . But mincemeat is still a food . And the inspector will not succeed in turning me into food A pleasure . - Mine too . Let 's go . - Let 's go . Bye . Oh , Simonet , you 're incredible ! Just like a monkey ! Excuse me , I 'm being called . I have to go . What a woman ! Drive you crazy . - Yes . You dropped something ! - Ah , thanks . Something wrong ? - No , don 't worry . What are you doing , Moses ? You 'll lose your rook in three moves . And who is this Mr. Moses ? Registered as a travelling businessman . But I 've no idea where he 's travelling . The road ends here ; the only way is back . Don 't be a wallflower , Mr. Inspector . Can I ask you to dance ? What a beautiful view ! Isn 't it ? Hinckus is still on the roof . Poor guy . - Why ? I don 't like him ! Mrs. Moses ? You promised me a dance . Simonet sobered me and ... I got drunk . Was it from the wine , Mrs. Moses , or something else , I do not know . But I felt I had to get some air . And I had to do something about the anonymous note thrust into my pocket . It read . " Hinckus is a dangerous gangster , a homicidal maniac called " Owl " he is planning a murder . Do something . " Hinckus ! Hinckus ! What ? What happened ? Olaf ! You have no power , either ? Quiet , gentlemen , quiet , please ! The light will be back in two minutes . Everything will be all right . I will turn on our backup generator . No sign of life in Hinckus ' room . It was as if he had vanished underground . This was not a weapon of a criminal . But why did he keep the toy in his case ? Looked like he was being set up as a dangerous criminal . But who ? Kaisa , come here ! Quick ! Kaisa ! What 's wrong with him ? - Maybe hypothermia Who is he ? - Don 't know . Brandy , quick ! You asleep ? I 'll fetch it myself . Cold as ice . Perhaps he is a friend of Mr. Hinckus ? Mr. Hinckus ? - Yes . I heard him dictating a telegram : " I am waiting for you , come quickly . " ' Yes , things look bad . The telephone and power are gone . The avalanche has cut us off completely . It will take them a week to dig us out . Not even a handkerchief . Are you alone ? - He is weak . Is somebody expecting you ? Olaf . Olaf Andvarafors . Olaf ! Olaf ! Strange . The door is locked from the inside . My God ... What 's wrong with him ? He is dead . Is this his suitcase ? - Yes . Is this all of his baggage ? - No , only this suitcase . Don 't tell anyone about this yet . Check the garage - if any car is missing . If you see Hinckus , try to detain him . Now go . The hand of the corpse was stretched out and almost touching a small suitcase . Olaf 's head was unnaturally twisted back / What strength the killer must have had ! Who did this ? - I don 't know ! Who tied you up ? - How should I know ? What time is it ? - One in the morning . One in the morning ! One in the morning ? Calm down ! Calm down , Hinckus . Who attacked you ? - I don 't know . - When did it happen ? - Just before ten . Do you suspect someone ? No , no , no ... I don 't know ! I don 't know ! From behind ! I don 't know ! I don 't know ... Don 't play dumb ! I ... I ... I ... I swear to you , I didn 't kill this woman ! She was already cold when I entered . - Wait a second ... She ... She was ... Shut up ! OK . Now talk . Tell me what happened . Here 's what happened . She had been flirting with me . But I didn 't dare ... But this evening ... She was stone-cold dead . I swear to you ! Come with me ! - Where ? - To the cell ! To solitary ! To the torture chamber ! Idiot . - Now . Just a moment . Put your trousers on ! Please forgive me . I swear to you , I swear ! I was drunk , sure , but not that drunk ! Look . This should be related to your profession Very interesting . Where did you find this ? - It 's Olafs . I don 't get it . Strange contraption . No , not my line of work . Something military , or outer space . Be careful , this might be dangerous . All right ... Go to bed . No , no ... this is madness ! That was all I needed - military or outer space , too ... There we go ... This is the safest place for it . Take the key . Alex . Are you sure Olaf and Brun retired between 10 and 10 : 30 ? Yes . Absolutely sure . - Thanks . That is very important . What the hell ! You crazy ? - Turn it off ! Three at night ! - Get the light off of me ! - Get out ! What 's your business here ? Don 't shout . Tell me where and when you saw Olaf for the last time ? And why do I have to tell you ? Get out ! Go to hell , goddamn cop ! Stop it ! There was a murder in the hotel and I am investigating it . Who is the victim ? - I 'll tell you later . Now listen to me . You left Olaf between 10 and 10 : 30 ? And then ? - I didn 't hear from him again . OK . Perhaps you saw someone in the hall ? Did somebody pass you ? Mrs. Moses ? No ? Hinckus was walking down the hall . Hinckus ? Hinckus ... Hinckus ? After 10 ? How was he dressed ? That silly fur coat of his . Listen , Hinckus , I 'm tired of you . Why 'd you lie about being accosted at 10 ? You were seen after 10 ? That 's the thing , inspector . They saw me in the hall ... and I saw ... me . And I strangled ... me . I ... me ... Do you understand ? I ... me ! Until then I hadn 't made a single mistake . No , I did make one key mistake . I did not sense the danger . I should have , must have realized something unusual . But I did not . I didn 't know whom to suspect . The women were ruled out , Moses , too . Hinckus was tied up . Maybe someone was disguised as Hinckus ? I don 't like it here . I don 't like your hotel ! The interrogations , murders , avalanches , dogs , your cluelessness . And as for the police , they break into my wife 's room at night ! How can you humiliate a man like this ! My wife , in this case ! I understand , Mr. Moses but still ... I already know you won 't rest until you get answers to your foolish questions . Well , remember , only two questions . Yes . Thanks . I 'm investigating a murder , It 's very important . Oh , gentlemen ! Wonderful night , isn 't it ? Please , take a seat . I must apologize for intruding at night , but I did notice you were not asleep . Tell me , did something awake you ? - Yes . Indeed I was not sleeping . But I cannot say anything woke me up . You didn 't hear anything ? - No , nothing . And you did not hear the avalanche ? Avalanche ? What avalanche ? Nothing terrible , I will tell you later . Around 9 : 30 last night you left the dance hall for a bit . Did you see anyone in the hall ? It seems to me ... Of course ! On my way back , I saw Olaf and Brun . Holding hands and talking as lovers do . Mrs. Moses , you 've been a great help . The victim is ... Olaf . I know you were the last to see him alive You lied to me about parting at the door . Where did you part ? Where , when and how ? What is it ? Quick ! Go ! Go away ! Go now ! And I never saw him again . I am sorry - you 're on the wrong track . Your professional experience is meaningless . Like time at greater than light speed . Alex , I like you . - I like you too . But if you play with me , I 'll suspect you . That will mean a world of trouble . Yes , of course . What can we do ... You are not ripe yet . I 'm so ripe I will fall off the tree soon Some tribes in Central Africa know how to revive their dead . The phenomenon is called zombie . Perhaps zombie is the third state of living organisms . I was tired and at an Impasse . I was listening to Snewahr talk about zombies and fell asleep . What ? What is it ? What happened ? Where did this come from ? Did you bring it ? There 's only one possibility - that the gun was thrown from the roof . Thus it was Hinckus stalking someone . Inspector , I 've been looking for you ! The guy has regained consciousness ! Where is Olaf Andvarafors ? Excuse me , I need to ask a few questions . What is your name ? Luarvik . - And your first name ? - Luarvik . Mr. Luarvik Luarvik ? - Yes . Well . Who are you ? Are you a foreigner ? Yes . Foreigner . Don 't come in ! Please leave immediately , Mr. Moses ! Don 't shout at me . I 'm leaving . I must inform you that Olaf Andvarafors was killed tonight . Killed ? Dead ? You don 't really know . I saw him myself , he is dead . - I want to see him . - Why ? I have business with him . Did he need to pass something to you ? - No . I have to talk to him . What about ? To him . To him ! Listen , Mr. Luarvik . I am investigating a murder . Do you understand ? Sooner or later you 'll tell me everything This may result in a lot of trouble . Why ? You want to identify the body ? - Identify ... Recognize ... How can you recognize him , if you haven 't seen his face ? - Why face ? Get dressed . This is Olaf Andvarafors . Strange . How did you recognize him ? - Recalled . I have seen him . And where did you see him ? - Elsewhere . Not important now . Are you looking for something ? Maybe a suitcase ? Where is it ? - I have the suitcase . Good . Bring it . OK . But first answer my questions . Why questions again ? I do not want questions . I ... I ... I want to lie down . Where can I lie down ? What to make of this ? I am almost convinced that Olaf , Luarvik and Moses belong to the same gang , which does not want publicity . But Hinckus - this is his revolver . He is also somehow connected to them . And that 's where I made my main mistake . Linking Moses and Luarvik to the murder . Are we holding Hinckus for no reason ? Let 's set him free ... like a fox into the chicken coop . Snewahr , make sure that everyone is at breakfast . It 's important . Good morning , Simonet ! Good morning , Brun ! - Hello . Good morning , inspector . - Good morning . How did you sleep ? - Good , thanks . You don 't look so good . Well , did you find anything ? - It depends . You know , I have a feeling , I sense the smell of death here . Beautiful morning . So warm and sunny ... Poor Olaf didn 't live to see it . Good morning , gentlemen . Let me present Mr. Luarvik Luarvik . He arrived last night . A pleasure . Gentlemen , we are temporarily cut off from the rest of the world . I understand . We are all under pressure . But don 't forget the investigation is in inspector Glebsky 's reliable hands . Attention , please . It appears some crooks selected this hotel as the place to settle their scores . With the help of Mr. Snewahr I sent word to the police by pigeon . A police helicopter will arrive shortly . The criminals will get their just deserts I advise that criminal activity be ceased I 'm warning you or else your position will be hopeless . Thank you for your attention . Ah , how interesting ! Bandits among us ? I wanted to scare them , but I knew that my pretend pigeons couldn 't help . We were cut off and I could count only on myself . Wait ! Wait , Hinckus . We have to talk . - About what ? Sit down . Of course , police tactics ... Part of the job . Well , Owl , let 's hear it A frank confession is your only chance . You 're confused , inspector . What " Owl " ? - Is this yours ? I don 't understand . What you do want ? Think fast , it will be better for you . Your friends will not come in time . But the police will arrive at any second . Got what you deserved ! Inspector , where did he hit you ? Your arm ? You were lucky , inspector . Very lucky . Pour some water on his head . He 's coming to . Well , Owl , should we talk now ? Damn it all ! I 've had it with all this ! Ask . If I know how to answer . Who are you ? - Have you heard of the hit squads ? Well , I am one of them . But this here ! This is horrifying ! Trust me , supernatural forces are at play - Cut the crap ! Get to the point ! Half a year ago a guy approached us . No one knew his name . They called him Master . They assigned the hardest jobs to him . Remember the Second National Bank job ? That 's was his doing . But then he quit working with us . Oh yes . He was always a bit eccentric . Wouldn 't let us kill hostages , or anyone . He said we shouldn 't . That 's why he had a fight with the Boss . And then he disappeared . With his assistant and wife . I was ordered by the Boss to find him . And you found them here . Who are they ? No . You tell me who they are ! What man could get the better of me , as if I were a kitten ? But this one did . - What ? Who ? - This woman . Moses knew I would not let him live . So he set his wife against me . She was coming right at me . You don 't believe me , but I was approaching me ! I don 't know how I didn 't lose my mind . Who is Olaf ? Is he also from your gang ? Listen , I know nothing about Olaf . I haven 't laid a finger on him . Now Moses won 't kill . He just can 't do it . That 's why he didn 't touch me . Is the Boss coming alone ? - No , he always has three guys with him . What will he do with Moses ? - Kill him , of course . Simonet , could I ask you to ... Simonet ! Open up ! Simonet ! Where are you , Simonet ! Simonet ! Si ... mo ... net ! Simonet had disappeared . Moses had to be stopped at any cost . Alex ! Come here ! Everything is quiet here . - Let 's go . Don 't worry , inspector . They cannot reach us by car . But terrorists can have helicopters . I 'm surprised they 're not here yet . Let 's go , Alex . Don 't be scared . Against the wall ! Don 't move ! Stop this goddamn hypnosis ! Mr. Moses ! You are charged with the National Bank robbery and the murder of Olaf Andvarafors . Inspector ! They are not people ! They are aliens from another planet . Yeah , they arrived directly from Venus ! I don 't know where they came from . From another universe , or from another galaxy . But they 're in trouble and we have to help them . Put away your weapon , inspector . Mr. Moses arrived here as an observer . He made a fatal mistake . He should not have contacted humans . Yes , this is true . But when I saw how you live here , I broke the rule . I wanted to help you so much . But your life proved to be too complex for me . Mr. Moses was deceived . They enticed him to fight for justice but it turned out that these were gangsters . He ran to this hotel so that he could leave our planet . Here in the mountains is our launch pad . But the avalanche destroyed the generator , which powered our robots . Our pilot Luarvik was severely injured . His spacesuit is torn . He is becoming weaker every second . Give them back Olaf 's suitcase ! - Do not babble , Simonet ! Olaf is not dead . Olaf is a robot . And Mrs. Moses is also a robot . Do you recall , after the avalanche she was dead , and now , as you see , she is alive . Because Mr. Moses turned on the backup battery last night . Olaf 's suitcase has one more , which feeds ... Which feeds your sick imagination ! Fantasy can explain every crime so everything is logical . Glebsky , return the suitcase to them ! Right in front of you they will turn on Olaf and then leave . - I don 't buy this ! But why ? You are being offered proof ! Why do you say nothing ? You have nothing to say ? I 'm not a scientist , I 'm a police officer I 've heard too many lies about this suitcase . Listen ! - Enough ! Was it you who called the police ? Yes . - And the note is also your doing ? Yes . I hoped that we would be rid of Hinckus . And that you 'd evade responsibility . Clumsy piece of work . An alien mask does not fit you , and the robots ... are not robots at all . Do you want to say that our robots are too much like humans ? Let them say what they want , I thought . If Olaf and this woman were robots , it 's worse . In the hands of terrorists they would be a terrible weapon . Clearly I selected a poor mask for myself It 's a pity I can 't show you my real face I know your real face , Mr. Moses . Your nickname is Master ! I must turn you in to the law . I stared at them , and for some reason I felt bad . Very bad . How I hoped for a miracle . I wanted the phone to talk and give me orders . What to do . What to do ? Inspector ! Inspector ! - Yes , what ? They say you can bring him back to life . No one can be brought back to life , It 's a fairy tale , Brun , a fairy tale . No , please listen to me ! I beg you , please revive him ! If Olaf is an android , then maybe I am also an android ! How could I know ? I am totally alone . Only you can help me . Only you , inspector . I beg of you ! Yes , I understood that Brun is a foolish moody girl . Hinckus - superstitious criminal . Simonet is a half-wit physicist with crazy ideas . Yet I felt they were right , not me . My experience , my senses , rebelled against this truth . Their truth seemed impossible , absurd . In order to perform my police duties , I had to draw on my experience , conservatism and conformism that I had gathered in 40 years . A sense of duty was all I had left . The policeman 's duty embedded into me . Simonet ! Go to the roof and watch the sky We 'll stay here with Alex . Luarvik is dying . Moses said he has no more than an hour . You will let him die . Glebsky ? I am a policeman . It 's not in my hands to punish or forgive The only thing I know is there is a law . One law for all . It says Moses is a criminal and killer . My duty is to bring him before a court . Here is an encounter between two worlds . Just think , they arrive here from God knows where and first they meet terrorists , and then a police officer like you . I don 't believe in aliens . If they are , what are they looking for ? Or observers . What are they observing ? How are " observers " from abroad called ? Simonet , I am a citizen of this country . And not just a citizen like you , arcane chatterbox , but an officer with certain duties ! You want another star on your uniform ? You 're just a pawn , a police pawn ! This is the first and the last time when fate handed you an important decision and you behave like a complete idiot ! The key is in his pocket ! Be quiet ! Lell ! - You too , Alex ! Don 't move , you 'll hurt yourself ! There is no such law ... Goodbye , humans ! Real contact is yet to come ! They 're coming ! Damn it ! We 're done for . I felt total indifference . Only In the depths of my heart did I feel a cowardly relief . The situation no longer depended on me . Responsibility was taken over by others . You see ! You 've got what you wanted ! Policeman ! Hero ! God forgive us all . Well ? Why are you staring at me ? No ! I acted correctly . I performed my duty . Duty . I didn 't break the law , I held it sacred . You say this entire strange crew died ? Well , so what ? Listen , let 's be logical . If they 're people , then they 're criminals and they got what they deserved . If they are not criminals ... then they are not people ! Why should I care about nonhumans , anyway ? Disguised as people ! Is it logical ? It is logical . Then I am right ? Then I acted correctly !

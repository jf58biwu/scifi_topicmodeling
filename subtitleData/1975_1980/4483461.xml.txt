 This is com station Epsilon 9 calling USS Columbia . Come in , Columbia . Respond , please . This is Scout Columbia , Epsilon 9 . Could you boost your transmission ? This is Epsilon 9 , Columbia . Am boosting output . How read you this ? Fine , fine . Thank you , Epsilon 9 . Receiving your transmission . Scout Columbia , NCC-621 ... to rendezvous with Scout Revere , NCC-595 ... on stardate 7411.4 . Further orders will be relayed at that time . Signed Commodore Prober to Starfleet . - End of transmission . - Received . Thank you . Our sensor drone is intercepting this on Quad L-14 . That 's within Klingon boundaries . Who are they fighting ? Unknown , sir . I have an exterior visual . We 've plotted a course on that cloud , Commander . It will pass into Federation space fairly close to us . Heading ? Sir , it 's on a precise heading for Earth . Commander Sonak . You received your appointment as Enterprise science officer ? Based , I am told , on your recommendation , Admiral . Thank you . Then why aren 't you aboard ? Captain Decker requested I complete final science briefing here before ... - Here ? - We leave on our mission . At Starfleet ? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock . Which will require 20 more hours at minimum ... Twelve . I 'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura ... which will not last more than three minutes . Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour . Report to you , sir ? It is my intention to be on that ship following that meeting . Report to me in one hour . - Admiral ! - Mr. Scott . Those departure orders ... 12 hours . Starfleet cannot be serious . Why aren 't the Enterprisetransporters operating , Mr. Scott ? A wee problem , sir . Just temporary . Admiral , we have just finished 18 months ... redesigning and refitting the Enterprise . How in hell do they expect me to have her ready in 12 hours ? Take me over , please . She needs more work , sir . A shakedown ! Mr. Scott , an alien object of unbelievable destructive power ... is less than three days away from this planet . The only starship in interception range is the Enterprise . Ready or not , she launches in 12 hours . The crew haven 't had near enough transition time ... with all the new equipment . And the engines ... They 're not even tested at warp power . And an untried captain . Two-and-a-half years as chief of Starfleet Operations ... may have made me a little stale , but I ... wouldn 't exactly consider myself untried . - They gave her back to me , Scotty . - Gave her back , sir ? I doubt it was that easy with Nogura . You 're right . Well , any man who could manage such a feat ... I would not dare disappoint . She 'll launch on time , sir , and she 'll be ready . - Thank you , Mr. Scott . - Aye , sir . Cargo bay to launch crew . A travel pod is now available at dock 6 . - Permission to come aboard , sir . - Granted , sir . Welcome aboard , Admiral . Commander Scott , you 're needed in Engineering immediately . Sir , you 'll excuse me . Flight deck , prepare for an incoming shuttlecraft . If you 'll follow me , I 'll show you ... I think I can find my way , Ensign . Aye , sir . Bridge . What 's the problem ? I thought you people had that circuit patched in an hour ago . We did . We had to disconnect it . All right . Take out ... It 's going to take us longer that way . We 're trying to save time . I 'm still waiting for a check on the line . What 's holding it up ? As soon as somebody can get to it . What 's the next program ? I 'll get somebody down there as soon as I can , Cleary . My people are all tied up now . Captain ! Starfleet just signaled your transfer of command orders . Capitain ! I apreciate the welcome . I wish the circunstances were less critical . Epsilon 9 is monitoring the intruder . Keep a channel open to them . Aye , sir . - Where 's Captain Decker ? - He 's in Engineering , sir . He ... He doesn 't know . - Mr. Chekov . - Aye , sir . Assemble the crew on the recreation deck at 0400 hours . I want to show them what we 're facing . He wanted her back . He got her . And Captain Decker ? He 's been with this ship every minute of her refitting . Ensign , the possibilities of our returning from this mission ... in one piece may have just doubled . Check Cleary on number six . - Need your cooler status . - Stand by . Space matrix restoration coils . Dilithium crystals . I knew it . The transporter sensor was not activated . Air equalization . Automatic off . Faulty module . Cleary , put a new backup sensor into the unit . Aye , sir . Admiral Kirk ! Well , we 're getting a top brass send-off . Don 't worry , she 'll launch on schedule ... if we have to tow her out with our bare hands , right , Scotty ? Aye . That we will , sir . - Let 's talk . - Sure . Let me know when that backup 's ready . All due respect , I hope this isn 't some kind of Starfleet pep talk . - I 'm really too busy . - I 'm taking over the center seat . You 're what ? I 'm replacing you as captain of the Enterprise . You 'll stay on as executive officer . Temporary grade reduction to commander . You personally are assuming command ? Yeah . - May I ask why ? - My experience . Five years out there dealing with unknowns like this . My familiarity with the Enterprise and its crew . Admiral , this is an almost totally new Enterprise . You don 't know her a tenth as well as I do . That 's why you 're staying aboard . I 'm sorry , Will . No , Admiral , I don 't think you 're sorry . Not one damn bit . I remember when you recommended me for this command . You told me how envious you were and how much you hoped ... you 'd find a way to get a starship command again . Well , sir , it looks like you found a way . Report to the bridge , Commander , immediately . Aye , sir . Transporter room ! Come in ! Urgent ! Redline on the transporter , Mr. Scott ! Transporter , do not engage ! - It 's too late . They 're beaming now . - Do not ... Do you read me , Starfleet ? Override it ! Pull them back ! Unable to retrieve their pattern , Enterprise . Give it to me . Starfleet , boost your matter gain . We need more signal . More signal ! - We 're losing their pattern ! - Oh , no , they 're forming . Starfleet , do you have them ? Enterprise , what we got back didn 't live long , fortunately . Starfleet , Kirk . Please express my condolences to their families . Commander Sonak 's can be reached through the Vulcan embassy . There was nothing you could have done , Rand . It wasn 't your fault . Yeoman , turboshaft 8 ? Back that way , sir . We have to replace Commander Sonak . I 'd still like a Vulcan there , if possible . None available , Captain . In fact , there 's no one who 's fully rated on this design . You are , Mr. Decker . I 'm afraid you 're going to have to double as science officer . That 's all we know about it ... except that it is now 53.4 hours away from Earth . Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way . Our orders are to intercept ... investigate and take whatever action is necessary ... and possible . Bridge to Captain . Priority signal from Epsilon 9 . - Put it on viewer . - On viewer , sir . Enterprise , the cloud is definitely a power field of some kind . Measures ... My God ... over two AU 's in diameter . Must be something incredible inside there generating it . We 're transmitting lingua code friendship messages ... on all frequencies . No response . Have a null reading at the center of the cloud . Definitely something inside there , but scans are being reflected back . - Some kind of power surge . - Receiving an odd pattern now . Enterprise , they could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act . They seem to be reactingto our scans , sir . Deflectors , emergency full ! - We are under attack . - External view . Viewer off . Prelaunch countdown will commence in 40 minutes . Transporter system fully repaired and functioning normally , sir . Dock signals clear , Captain . Reply we are holding position , awaiting final crew replacements . Aye , sir . Transporter personnel reports ... the navigator , Lieutenant Ilia ... She 's already aboard and en route to the bridge , sir . She 's Deltan , Captain . Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty , sir . Welcome aboard , Lieutenant . - Hello , Ilia . - Decker . I was stationed on the lieutenant 's home planet some years ago . Commander Decker ? Yes , our exec and science officer . Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in me . And in you , too , Lieutenant . My oath of celibacy is on record , Captain . - May I assume my duties ? - By all means . Starfleet reports our last six crew members are ready to beam up ... but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter . Oh ? L 'll see to it that he beams up . Transporter room . - Yeoman ? - Yes , sir ? - What was the problem down there ? - He insisted we go first , sir . Said something about first seeing how it scrambled our molecules . Has a familiar ring , doesn 't it ? Starfleet , this is Captain Kirk . Beam that officer up now . Well , for a man who swore he 'd never return to Starfleet ... Just a moment , Captain , sir . L 'll explain what happened . Your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little-known ... seldom-used reserve activation clause . In simpler language , Captain , they drafted me ! They didn 't . This was your idea . This was your idea , wasn 't it ? Bones , there 's a thing out there . Why is any object we don 't understand always called a thing ? Headed this way . I need you . Damn it , Bones , I need you . Badly ! Permission to come aboard . Permission granted , sir . Well , Jim , I hear Chapel 's an MD now . Well , I 'm going to need a top nurse ... not a doctor who will argue every little diagnosis with me . And they probably redesigned the whole sick bay too ! I know engineers . They love to change things . Dock control reports ready , sir . - Helm ready , sir . - Orbital departure on plot , sir . Yard command signaling clear , sir . - Maneuvering thrusters , Mr. Sulu . - Maneuvering thrusters , sir . Hold station . Thrusters at station-keeping , sir . Thrusters ahead , Mr. Sulu . Take us out . Intermix set , Bridge . Impulse power at your discretion . Impulse power , Mr. Sulu . Ahead warp . 5 . Departure angle on viewer . Departure angle . - Viewer ahead . - Viewer ahead . Captain 's Log : Stardate 7412 . 6 ... 1.8hours from launch . In order to intercept the intruder at the earliest possible time ... we must now risk engaging warp drive while still within the solar system . Captain , assuming we have full warp capability ... accelerating to warp 7 on leaving the solar system ... will bring us to IP with the intruder in 20.1 hours . Well , Bones , do the new medical facilities meet with your approval ? They do not . It 's like working in a damn computer center . - Programming ready ? - Set for standard warp entry . But I still recommend further simulation study . Mr. Decker , every minute brings that object closer to Earth . Engineering , stand by for warp drive . Captain , we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors . Engineer , we need warp speed now ! Jim , you 're pushing . Your people know their jobs . That 's it , sir . L can 't do any better . Aye , lad . It 's borderline on the simulator . L cannot guarantee she 'll hold up . Warp drive , Mr. Scott . - Ahead warp 1 , Mr. Sulu . - Accelerating to warp 1 , sir . Warp . 7 , .8 . Warp 1 , sir . Mr. Decker ... Wormhole . Get us back on impulse power . Full reverse . Negative helm control , Captain . Going reverse on impulse power . Subspace frequencies jammed , sir ! Wormhole effect ! Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22.5 seconds ... before forward velocity slows to sublight speed . Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us . - Directly ahead . - Force fields up full . Put object on viewer . - Go manual override on helm . - No manual response , sir . Navigational deflectors coming up , sir . Wormhole distortion has overloaded the main power systems . Navigational deflectors inoperative , Captain . Directional control also inoperative . Time to impact ? Twenty seconds . Mr. Chekov , stand by on phasers . No ! Belay that phaser order ! Arm photon torpedoes ! Photon torpedoes ... armed ! Object is an asteroid . Reading mass . 7 . Targeting ... asteroid ! Impact in ten seconds . Impact in eight seconds . - Fire torpedoes ! - Six ! Torpedoes away ! Five ! Helm control restored , sir . - Position report , Navigator . - Computing new intersection course . Communications are normal , sir . Negative damage reported , Captain . No casualties reported , Doctor . Wrong , Mr. Chekov . There are casualties . My wits , as in " frightened out of , " Captain , sir . We were at warp . 8 . Engineer , report your status there . In just a second , Exec . We 're picking up the pieces down here . Mr. Scott , we need warp drive as soon as possible . The engine imbalance created the wormhole in the first place . It 'll happen again if we don 't correct it . That object is less than two days away from Earth . We need to intercept while it still is out there . Lay in a heading to conform with our initial IP with the intruder . Mr. Sulu , you have the com . Mr. Decker . - L 'd like to see you in my quarters . - Mind if I tag along , Captain ? Level 5 . All right , explanation . Why was my phaser order countermanded ? The Enterprise redesignincreases phaser power ... by channeling it through the main engines . When they went into antimatter imbalance ... the phasers were automatically cut off . Then you acted properly , of course . Thank you , sir . I 'm sorry if I embarrassed you . - You saved the ship . - I 'm aware of that , sir . Stop competing with me , Decker . - Permission to speak freely , sir ? - Granted . Sir , you haven 't logged a single star hour in two-and-a-half years . That , plus your unfamiliarity with the ship 's redesign ... in my opinion , sir , seriously jeopardizes this mission . L trust you will ... nursemaid me through these difficulties ? Yes , sir , I 'll do that . Then I won 't keep you from your duties any longer , Commander . - Yes , Doctor ? - Aye , sir . He may be right , Jim . - Was it difficult ? - No more than I expected . About as difficult as seeing you again . - I 'm sorry . - That you left Delta IV ? Or that you didn 't even say good-bye ? If I had seen you again ... would you have been able to say it ? No . Make your point , Doctor . The point , Captain , is that it 's you who is competing . You rammed getting this command down Starfleet 's throat . You 've used this emergency to get the Enterprise back . And I intend to keep her , is that what you 're saying ? Yes . It 's an obsession . An obsession that can blind you ... to far more immediate and critical responsibilities . Your reaction to Decker is an example , Jim . - Bridge to Captain . - Viewer on . Signal from a Federation registered long-range shuttle , sir . She wishes to come alongside and lock on . For what purpose ? My security scan shows it has a grade-one priority , Captain . Non belligerency confirmed . L suspect it is a courier of some kind . Very well , Mr. Chekov . See to it . Viewer off . Your opinion has been noted . Anything further ? That depends on you . Security scan : One boarder . Identity : Starfleet , inactive . - Permission to come aboard , sir . - Granted , sir . Granted . Why ... Why , it 's Mister ... Spock ! Spock . Commander , if I may ? If ... Oh . I 've been monitoring your communications with Starfleet . I 'm aware of your engine design difficulties . I offer my services as science officer ... with all due respect , Commander . - If our exec has no objections . - Of course not . I 'm well aware of Mr. Spock 's qualifications . Mr. Chekov , log Mr. Spock 's Starfleet commission reactivated . List him as science officer . Both effective immediately . Mr. Spock . Well , so help me , I 'm actually pleased to see you . It 's how we all feel , Mr. Spock . Captain , with your permission ... I will now discuss these fuel equations with the engineer . Mr. Spock . Welcome aboard . Captain 's Log : Stardate 7413.4 . Thanks to Mr. Spock 's timely arrival and assistance ... we have the engines rebalanced into full warp capacity . Repair time : Less than three hours . Which means we will now be able to intercept intruder ... while still more than a day from Earth . Warp . 8 . .9 . Warp 2 , sir . Warp 3 . Warp 4 . Warp 5 . Warp 6 . Warp 7 . Science Officer Spock , reporting as ordered , Captain . Please , sit down . Spock , you haven 't changed a bit . You 're just as warm and sociable as ever . Nor have you , Doctor ... as your continued predilection for irrelevancy demonstrates . Gentlemen . At last report , you were on Vulcan ... apparently to stay . Yes , you were undergoing the " Kolanear " discipline . Sit down . If you are referring to the Kolinahr , Doctor , you are correct . Well , however it 's pronounced , Mr. Spock , it 's the Vulcan ritual ... that 's supposed to purge all remaining emotions . The Kolinahr is also a discipline you broke to join us . Will you , please , sit down ? On Vulcan I began sensing a consciousness ... from a source more powerful than I have ever encountered . Thought patterns of exactingly perfect order . I believe they emanate from the intruder . I believe it may hold my answers . Isn 't it lucky for you that we just happened to be heading your way ? Bones ! We need him . I need him . Then my presence is to our mutual advantage . Any thought patterns you might sense ... whether they appear to affect you personally or not ... I expect immediately reported . Of course , Captain . - Is there anything else ? - No . Jim ? If this super intelligence ... is as important to him as he says it is , how do we know ... That he wouldn 't put his own interests ahead of the ship 's ? I could never believe that . How do we know about any of us ? Bridge to Officers ' Lounge . Captain Kirk . Revised estimate on cloud visualcontact : 3 . 7minutes . On my way . Order new backup settings there . Present status . Give us apriority , Commander . Bridge Communication to Flight Conn . Check your subspace alignment . Standard light , Engineer . - Full mag on viewer . - Full mag , sir . Lingua code ? Continuing friendship messages on all frequencies , sir . All decks and divisions confirmed . Status red . Captain , we are being scanned . Do not return scan , Mr. Spock . It could be misinterpreted as hostility . Intruder scans emanating from the exact center of the cloud . Energy of a type ... never before encountered . There 's no response to friendship messages , sir . - Shall I go to battle stations ? - Negative . We 'll take no provocative action . Recommend defensive posture , Captain . Screens and shields . No , Mr. Decker , that could also be misinterpreted as hostile . Cloud composition , Mr. Spock ? - Twelfth-power energy field . - Twelfth-power ? We 've seen what their weapons can do . Shouldn 't we take every precaution ? - Mr. Decker ... - Captain . L suspect there 's an object at the heart of that cloud . L will not provoke an attack . If that order isn 't clear enough ... Captain , as your exec it 's my duty ... to point out alternatives . Yes , it is . I stand corrected . Five minutes to cloud boundary . Navigator , lay in a conic section flight path to the cloud center . Bring us parallel to whatever we find in there . Mr. Sulu , tactical plot on viewer . Tactical on viewer , sir . That measures 12th-power energy ? Thousands of starships couldn 't generate that much ... Mr. Spock ? Spock , tell me . I sense ... puzzlement . We have been contacted . Why have we not replied ? Contacted ? How ? Force fields up full . Deflectors , now . Force fields and deflectors up full , Captain . Analysis , Mr. Spock . Alien weapon is a form of plasma energy , Captain . Exact composition unknown . Guidance system unknown . All decks , brace for impact . Engineering , status report . Systems overloading , Captain . Medic . Medics are coming . Engineering to Bridge . Cannot hold full power on force fields . Deflector power is down 70 percent . Divert auxiliary power to deflectors . Oh , good . Christine , it 's Chekov . Medic . I can stop his pain . Thank you . Captain . The intruder has been attempting to communicate . Frequency : More than one million megahertz ... and at such a high rate of speed ... their entire message lasts only a millisecond . I am now programming our computer ... to transmit lingua code at their frequency and rate of speed . Commander . Spock ! Here it comes . Engineering , what 's happening to our force field ? Our shields cannot handle another attack . Mr. Spock . Spock . Fifteen seconds . Spock , transmit now . Ten seconds . Transmitting . It would seem our friendship messages ... have been received and understood , Mr. Spock . I would say that was a logical assumption , Captain . One minute , 30 seconds to cloud boundary . Captain ... we are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality . Yet they cannot understand ... who we are or what we want . And yet it would seem that they understood our message . They broke off the attack . They may have attacked only as a warning to us , Captain ... to keep away . That would presuppose a feeling ... Commander . Compassion . I sense no emotion . Only pure logic . Mr. Sulu , hold present position . Holding present position , sir . Tactical plot on viewer . Course projection on tactical , sir . Opinion , Mr. Spock . Recommend we proceed , Captain . - Mr. Decker ? - L advise caution , Captain . We can 't withstand another attack . That thing is 20 hours away from Earth . - We know nothing about it as yet . - Precisely the point , Captain . We don 't know what it 'll do . Moving into that cloud at this time ... is an unwarranted gamble . How do you define " unwarranted " ? You asked my opinion , sir . Viewer . Standard ahead . Navigator , maintain course . Helmsman ... steady as she goes . No vessel could generate a power field of this magnitude . Spock . Instruments fluctuating , Captain . Patterns unrecognizable . Transmit image of alien to Starfleet . Advise we are attempting further communication . Unable to make contact with Starfleet , Captain . Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud is being reflected back . We are closing on it rapidly , Captain . Reduce magnification factor four , Mr. Sulu . We are already two settings below that , sir . Mr. Sulu ... bring us into a parallel course ... over the alien ... at 500 meters . Five hundred meters ? Then take us out to 100 kilometers distance ... adjusting parallel course . Aye , sir . Viewer astern . Reverse angle on the view , Captain . Five hundred meters . Viewer ahead , sir . Hold relative position here . Mr. Spock ! Can that be one of their crew ? A probe from their vessel , Captain . Plasma-energy combination . Don 't interfere with it . Absolutely , I will not interfere . No one interfere . It doesn 't seem interested in us . Only the ship . Computer off . It 's taking control of the computer . It 's running our records ... Earth defenses , Starfleet strength . Ilia ! Ilia ! This is how I define " unwarranted . " Activate auxiliary computer circuits through manual shutoff . Captain , we 've been seized by a tractor beam . Get someone up here to take the navigator 's station . - Engineering . - Chief DiFalco , to the bridge . - Emergency power . - Going to full emergency . But , Captain , if we don 't break free in 15 seconds , she 'll burn up . We cannot break free , Captain . We have only a fraction of the power necessary . Engineering , belay that order . Disengage all main drive systems . Chief DiFalco , take over Lieutenant Ilia 's station . DiFalco , disengage engine navigation relays now . Aye , sir . Force field circuits E-10 through 14 ... show ready for reactivation . Confirm , please . Scotty , drive systems should be free now . Commander ? Ready to launch remote communications drone ... with complete ship 's records ... including our present situation , sir . Delay launching as long as possible . Our drone can 't escape as long as we 're held in their tractor . Aye . Captain , a maximum phaser strike directly at the beam ... might weaken it just enough for us to break free . Break free to where , Commander ? Any show of resistance would be futile , Captain . We don 't know that , Mr. Spock . Why are you opposed to trying ? Why bring us inside ? Not to destroy us . They could have done that outside . They still can . Curiosity , Mr. Decker . Insatiable curiosity . Captain , photic sonar readings indicate the aperture is closing . We 're trapped , sir . Reverse angle on the viewer , Captain . Tractor beam has released us , Captain . Confirmed . Vessel is floating free . No forward momentum . Viewer ahead . Viewer ahead , sir . Maneuvering thrusters , Mr. Sulu . Ahead one third . Thrusters ahead one third . Let 's take a look . Full sensor scan , Mr. Spock . They can 't expect us not to look them over now . Now that we 're looking down their throat . Right , now that we 've got them just where they want us . It 's closing up . Hold position . Captain . All our scans are being reflected back . Sensors are useless . Damn . What do you make of all this ? I believe the closed orifice leads to another chamber ... undoubtedly part of the vessel 's inner mechanism . I suspect it may be necess ... Intruder alert ! Deck 5 . Officer 's quarters . Have Security meet me at deck 5 , main elevator . Spock . Mr. Decker , you have the com . Hold positions . You are the Kirk unit . You will assist me . I have been programmed by V 'Ger ... to observe and record ... normal functions of the carbon-based units ... infesting USS Enterprise . - Jim , what 's going on ? - Tricorder . Who is ... V 'Ger ? V 'Ger is that which programmed me . Is V 'Ger the name of the captain of the alien vessel ? Jim . This is a mechanism . A probe , Captain . No doubt a sensor-transceiver combination ... recording everything we say and do . Where is Lieutenant Ilia ? That unit no longer functions . I 've been given its form ... to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units ... infesting Enterprise . Carbon-based units ? Humans , Ensign Perez . Us . Why does V 'Ger travel ... to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead ? To find the creator . Find the creator ? Whose ... What does V 'Ger want with the creator ? To join with him . To join with the creator ? How ? V 'Ger and the creator will become one . And who is the creator ? The creator is that which created V 'Ger . Who is V 'Ger ? V 'Ger is that which seeks the creator . I 'm ready to commence my observations . Doctor , a thorough examination of this probe ... might provide some insight into those who manufactured it ... and how to deal with them . Fine . Let 's get her to sick bay . I 'm programmed to observe and record ... only the normal functioning of the carbon-based units . The , uh ... examination is a normal function . You may proceed . Micro-miniature hydraulics ... sensors ... and molecule-sized multiprocessor chips . And take a look at this . An osmotic micropump , right here . Even the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated . Every exocrine system is the same , too ... even eye moisture . Decker . Fascinating . Not " Decker unit . " Gentlemen . Will . - What happened to her ? - Captain . This probe may be our key to the aliens . - Probe ? Ilia ? - Exactly . It is a programmed mechanism , Commander . Its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail . Suppose that , beneath its programming ... the real Ilia 's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision . - They had a pattern to follow . - Indeed . They may have followed it too precisely . Ilia 's memory ... her feelings of loyalty , obedience , friendship ... might all be there . You did have a relationship with Lieutenant Ilia , Commander . That probe , in another form , is what killed Ilia . Commander ... Will , we 're locked in an alien vessel ... six hours from Earth 's orbit . Our only contact with our captor is that probe . If we can control it , persuade it , use it ... I have recorded enough here . You will now assist me further . The , uh ... Decker unit can assist you with much greater efficiency . Carry on with your assignment , Mr. Decker . Aye , sir . I am concerned with that being our only source of information , Captain . Captain 's Log : Stardate 7414 . 1 . Our best estimates place us some four hours from Earth . No significant progress thus far ... reviving Ilia memory patterns within the alien probe . This remains our only means of contact with our captor . All those vessels were called Enterprise . The carbon units use this area for recreation . This is one of the games . What types of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy ? The words " recreation " ... and " enjoy " ... have no meaning to my programming . Ilia enjoyed this game . She nearly always won . Good . He 's using audiovisual association . This device serves no purpose . Why does Enterprise require the presence of carbon units ? Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units . More data concerning this functioning is necessary ... before carbon units can be patterned ... for data storage . What does that mean ? When my examination is complete ... all carbon units will be reduced to data patterns . Within you ... are the memory patterns of a certain carbon unit . If I can help you to revive those patterns ... you could understand our functions better . That is logical . You may proceed . I remember Lieutenant Ilia once mentioning she wore that . Put it on . On Delta . Remember ? Ilia . Dr. Chapel . Will ? Ilia . Commander . Commander . This is a mechanism . Ilia ... help us make direct contact with V 'Ger . I cannot . This creator V 'Ger is looking for ... what is it ? V 'Ger does not know . Computer , commence recording . Captain Kirk , these messages will detail my attempt ... to contact the aliens . I intend to calculate thruster ignition and acceleration rate ... to coincide with the opening of the V 'Ger orifice . This should facilitate a better view ... of the interior of the alien spacecraft . Captain , Starfleet signals are growing in strength , sir . They still have the intruder on their monitors . - It 's decelerating . - Confirmed , sir . Lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into Earth orbit . Sir , air lock 4 has been opened . A thruster suit is reported missing . A thruster suit ? That 's Spock . Damn him . Bring him back here . No , wait . - Get a fix on his position . - Aye , sir . L have successfully penetrated ... the next chamber of the alien 's interior ... and I 'm witnessing some sort of dimensional image ... which I believe to be a representation ... of V 'Ger 's home planet . I 'm passing through a connecting tunnel . Apparently , a kind of plasma-energy conduit . Possibly a field coil for a gigantic imaging system . Curious . I 'm seeing images of planets , moons , stars ... whole galaxies all stored here , recorded . It could be a representation of V 'Ger 's entire journey . But who or what ... are we dealing with ? The Epsilon 9 station , stored here with every detail . Captain , I am now quite convinced ... that all of this is V 'Ger ... that we are inside a living machine . Ilia . The sensor ... must contain some special meaning . L must try to mind-meld with it . Spock . Spock ! Spock . Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiber connection . Indications of some neurological trauma . The power pouring through that mind-meld must have been staggering . Spock . Jim . L should have known . Were you right ... about V 'Ger ? A life-form of its own . A conscious , living entity . A living machine ? It considers the Enterprise a living machine . That 's why the probe refers to our ship as an entity . L saw V 'Ger 's planet . A planet populated by living machines . Unbelievable technology . V 'Ger has knowledge that spans this universe . And yet ... with all its pure logic ... V 'Ger is barren ... cold . No mystery . No beauty . Should have known . Known ? Known what ? Spock . What should you have known ? What should you have known ? Jim ... this ... simple feeling ... is beyond V 'Ger 's comprehension . No meaning , no hope . Jim ... no answers . It 's asking questions . " Is this ... all that I am ? Is there nothing more ? " Bridge to Captain . Kirk here . A faint signal from Starfleet , sir . Intruder cloud has been located on their outer monitors ... for the past 27 minutes . Cloud dissipating rapidly as it approaches . Starfleet reports forward velocity has slowed to sub-warp speed . We are three minutes from Earth orbit . I 'll be right there . I need Spock on the bridge . Dalaphaline , five cc 's . Captain , Starfleet is sending this tactical on V 'Ger 's position . V 'Ger is transmitting a signal . Jim . From V 'Ger . V 'Ger signals the creator . Spock ? A simple binary code ... transmitted by carrier wave signal . Radio . Radio ? Jim . V 'Ger expects an answer . An answer ? I don 't know the question . The creator has not responded . All planetary defense systems have just gone inoperative . Sir , Starfleet computes the devices are proceeding ... toward equidistant positions orbiting the planet . They 're the same things that hit us . They are hundreds of times more powerful , Captain . From those positions ... they could devastate the entire surface of the planet . Why ? The creator has not answered . The carbon unit infestation is to be removed from the creator 's planet . Why ? You infest Enterprise . You interfere with the creator in the same manner . Carbon units are not an infestation . They are ... a natural function of the creator 's planet . They are living things . They are not true life-forms . Only the creator and other similar life-forms are true . " Similar life-forms . " Jim , V 'Ger is saying its creator is a machine . A machine . Captain . V 'Ger is a child . I suggest you treat it as such . - A child ? - Yes , Captain . A child ... evolving , learning , searching ... instinctively needing . - Needing what ? - Spock . This child is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth . Now , what do you suggest we do ? Spank it ? It knows only that it needs , Commander . But , like so many of us ... it does not know what . The carbon units know why the creator has not responded . Disclose the information . Not until V 'Ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet . Captain . I 'm losing Starfleet . Interference from V 'Ger . Kirk unit , disclose the information . Why has the creator not responded ? No . Secure all stations . Clear the bridge . Clear the bridge , Captain ? - That was the order , Mr. Sulu . - Aye , sir . Your child is having a tantrum , Mr. Spock . V 'Ger requires the information . Bridge , secure all stations . Move out . Jim , what the hell kind of strategy is this ? All ship 's functions going to automatic , Captain . If V 'Ger destroys the Enterprise ... the information that V 'Ger requires will also be destroyed . It is illogical to withhold required information . Kirk unit ! Kirk unit . Why do you not disclose information ? Because V 'Ger 's going to destroy all carbon units on the third planet . They have repressed the creator . The information will not be disclosed . V 'Ger needs the information . Then V 'Ger must withdraw all the orbiting devices . V 'Ger will comply ... if the carbon units will disclose the information . It learns fast , doesn 't it ? Captain , the vessel ... V 'Ger ... obviously operates from a central brain complex . The orbiting devices would be controlled from that point , then . Precisely . The carbon unit 's information cannot be disclosed to V 'Ger 's probe ... but only to V 'Ger directly . Forward motion , Captain . Tractor beam . Captain , what 's the next move ? The question is , Mr. Decker ... is there a next move ? Resume duty stations . All personnel , resume stations . Well , Mr. Decker , it seems my bluff has been called . I 'm afraid our hand is pretty weak , Captain . Mr. Chekov , when do those devices reach final position ? Twenty-seven minutes . Mark . - Engineering . - Scott here . Mr. Scott , be prepared to execute Starfleet order 2-0-0-5 . When , sir ? On my command . Aye , sir . Why has the captain ordered self-destruct , sir ? L would say , lass , because he thinks ... he hopes that when we go up , we 'll take the intruder with us . Will we ? When that much matter and antimatter are brought together ... oh , yes , we will indeed . Eighteen minutes to device activation , sir . Gravity control , get me an all-decks readout . Starfleet has been apprised of our situation , Captain . Crew status is 1-7-2 at duty stations ... 2-4-8 of fi-duty ... 11 in sickbay 0-9'er . Tractor beam remains constant . We are 17 kilometers inside the vessel . Engineering , show me your pylon stress readings . Deck4 , that temperature should read 1-0-1-3 degrees . Please confirm . Spock . Mr. Spock . Not for us . No , Captain , not for us . For V 'Ger . L weep for V 'Ger as I would for a brother . As I was when I came aboard ... so is V 'Ger now ... empty , incomplete and searching . Logic and knowledge are not enough . Spock , are you saying that you found what you needed ... but V 'Ger hasn 't ? What would V 'Ger need to fulfill itself ? Each of us ... at some time in our lives , turns to someone ... a father , a brother , a god ... and asks ... " Why am I here ? What was I meant to be ? " V 'Ger hopes to touch its creator ... to find its answers . " Is this all that I am ? Is there nothing more ? " Captain . Forward motion slowing , Captain . Captain , I believe that is our destination . I read an oxygen-gravity envelope forming outside the Enterprise . Forward motion stopped , Captain . V 'Ger . Sir , I 've located the source of V 'Ger 's radio signal . It 's directly ahead . That transmitter is a vital link between V 'Ger and its creator . The carbon units will now provide V 'Ger ... with the required information . Mr. Spock . Bones . Mr. Decker , I will contact you every five minutes . Captain . I 'd like to go along . Mr. Sulu , you have the com . V 'Ger . " V ... G-E-R . " V 'Ger . " V-O-Y-A-G-E-R . " Voyager . Voyager 6 . NASA . National Aeronautics and Space Administration . Jim ... this was launched more than 300 years ago . Voyager series . Designed to collect data ... and transmit it back to Earth . Captain ... Voyager 6 disappeared into what they used to call a black hole . It must have emerged on the far side of the galaxy ... and fell into the machine planet 's gravitational field . The machine inhabitants found it to be one of their own kind ... primitive , yet kindred . They discovered its simple 20th-century programming ... collect all data possible . Learn all that is learnable . Return that information to its creator . Precisely , Mr. Decker . The machines interpreted it literally . They built this entire vessel ... so that Voyager could actually fulfill its programming . And on its journey back ... it amassed so much knowledge ... it achieved consciousness itself . It became a living thing . Kirk unit . V 'Ger awaits the information . Enterprise ... order up the ship 's computer library records ... on the late 20th-century NASA probe Voyager 6 . Specifically , we want the old NASA code signal ... that instructs the probe to transmit its data . - And fast , Uhura , fast . - Aye , sir . That 's what it 's been signaling ... its readiness to transmit its information . And there 's no one on Earth ... who could recognize the old signal and send a response . The creator does not answer . V 'Ger . V 'Ger . V 'Ger ! We are the creator . That is not logical . Carbon units are not true life-forms . We will prove it . We will make it possible for you to complete your programming . Only the creator could accomplish that . Enterprise ? We have just received the response code , Captain . Set the Enterprise transmitter on appropriate frequency ... and transmit the code now . Transmitting . 5-0-4 ... 3-2-9 ... 3-1-7 ... 5-1-0 ... and the final sequence . That should trigger Voyager 's transmitter . Voyager is not transmitting its data , Captain . The creator must join with V 'Ger . Uhura , repeat the final sequence . The creator must join with V 'Ger . Voyager is not transmitting , Captain ... because it did not receive the final sequence . Jim , we 're down to ten minutes . Enterprise , stand by . - The antenna leads are melted away . - Yes , Captain , just now . By V 'Ger itself . - Why ? - To prevent reception . Of course . To bring the creator here . To finish transmitting the code in person . To touch the creator . Capture God ? V 'Ger 's liable to be in for one hell of a disappointment . Perhaps not , Doctor . Captain . V 'Ger must evolve . Its knowledge has reached the limits of this universe . It must evolve . What it requires of its god , Doctor , is the answer to its question ... Is there nothing more ? What more is there than the universe , Spock ? Other dimensions . Higher levels of being . The existence of which cannot be proven logically . Therefore , V 'Ger is incapable of believing in them . What V 'Ger needs in order to evolve ... is a human quality ... our capacity to leap beyond logic . Joining with its creator might accomplish that . You mean this machine wants to physically join with a human ? Is that possible ? Let 's find out . Decker . I 'm gonna key the final sequence through the ground test computer . You don 't know what that 'll do to you ! Yes , I do , Doctor . Decker , don 't . Jim , I want this . As much as you wanted the Enterprise , I want this . Captain . Spock , did we just see the beginning of a new life-form ? Yes , Captain . We witnessed a birth . Possibly a next step in our evolution . I wonder . Well , it 's been a long time since I delivered a baby . L hope we got this one off to a good start . I hope so too . I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose ... out of our own human weaknesses ... and the drive that compels us to overcome them . And a lot of foolish human emotions . Right , Mr. Spock ? Quite true , Doctor . Unfortunately , it will have to deal with them as well . Interrogative from Starfleet . They 're requesting damage and injury reports and complete vessel status . Report two casualties . Lieutenant Ilia . Captain Decker . - Aye , sir . - Correction . They 're not casualties . They ... List them as missing . Vessel status : Fully operational . Aye , sir . Mr. Scott , shall we give the Enterprise a proper shakedown ? I would say it 's time for that , sir , aye . We can have you back on Vulcan in four days , Mr. Spock . Unnecessary , Mr. Scott . My task on Vulcan is completed . Mr. Sulu , ahead warp 1 . - Warp 1 , sir . - Heading , sir ? Out there . That away .

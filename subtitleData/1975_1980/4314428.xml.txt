 ( Helena ) ' Moonbase Alpha status report . '565 days since leaving Earth 's orbit . Dr Helena Russell recording . 'Two days ago , we encountered a small planet moving across our path . 'Our scanners detected milgonite , 'a rare mineral vital to our life support system . 'Eagle Four , with a specially adapted laboratory section , 'was despatched to carry out a full geological survey of the planet . ' Hey , that was some cloud bank . I almost forget what clouds look like . You can say that again ! ( Beeping ) We now have close visual contact . The closer the better . Too close too quickly can be dangerous . Mm . Definitely ! ( Koenig ) ' Maya , what have you got for us ? ' She 's a big girl , Tony . She 's not used to loud-mouthed Irish Romeos . - But she 's a quick study . - Hmph ! Geophysical scan confirms presence of large deposits of milgonite . Life signs ? Some kind of life form is registering . - Minimal and unidentifiable . - Atmosphere ? Oxygen , nitrogen , inert gases , hydrogen . - Breathable . - Sounds all right . ( Koenig ) ' A piece of cake . ' ( Maya ) ' What ? ' ( Koenig ) ' Nothing to give us trouble . ' Not a bad landing , Alan . Not bad . Not bad ? You didn 't feel a thing ! How much time do we have before Alpha 's out of range ? If we 're not off this planet in three hours ... Three hours and two minutes to be exact . Three hours . Let 's conserve energy . Switch to minimum power . Hey ! That 's my lucky hat ! Never seen one of these before , eh ? That 's the trouble with your planet . They never had the state of Texas . Or an Irish cowboy . We had many wonderful things on Zycon . ( Koenig ) All right , everybody , gather round . - All set ? - Mm-hm . We 've got exactly three hours . Commander , in three hours we 'll have enough milgonite - to last Alpha indefinitely . - I hope you 're right . Maya , program Computer for three hours . ( Computer ) ' Minus three hours to lift-off . ' ( Helena ) My turn to mind the store . Somebody has to . Tony , stay with her . Let 's go . Aye-aye ! I can hear that milgonite calling ! Dave ! Hello , hello , hello . Well , that 's her ! Oh ! ( Laughs ) What a beaut ! What a beauty ! Say hello to big Dave ! I hate to break up your romance with this rock but we 've got work to do ! The rocks understand me , Commander . Me wives never did but the rocks do . Fastest gun on Alpha . ( Gun clicking ) Right . Well ... get ready to dig for gold . ( Silence ) Hello ... Now , that ... That is strange . What is it , Dave ? It 's not milgonite . - Then what is it ? - I don 't know . But there must be a source of energy for that glow . Let 's take a sample back to the Eagle for analysis . First , let 's check it for radiation or dangerous elements . Right . ( Humming ) Uh-uh . Nope ... No ... Negative . Then , go ahead . OK . ( Screeching ) Right . Hello ? Something 's off-balance . Let 's find out how off-balance . ( Koenig ) Computer negative . I don 't buy it . That rock has got to show some geological reaction . There 's no sign of any life form now . Everybody leave it alone . It 's my baby . ( Screams ) He 's dead . ( Computer ) ' Minus two hours 45 minutes to lift-off . ' - Get that thing out . - Hold it ! I said get it out ! John ! I 'm getting brain wave patterns ! ( Koenig ) You said he had cardiac arrest . Yes . All his organs are functioning normally . His heart has stopped . He 's alive ! This may shock his heart back . - It might destroy the rest of him . - I 've got to chance it . ( Whirring ) ( Whirring ) ( Whirring ) - It 's no use . - He began to respond . - That was involuntary . - Helena ! I 'm a doctor , not a miracle worker ! I can cope with the known , but the unknown ... - Tony 's brain is still functioning . - It 's one of the mysteries of life . I said get rid of that ! - You can 't ! - You saw what it did . Any cure will be in the rock . We don 't know what the hell we 're dealing with . We take him back to Alpha and cure him there . Maya 's right , John . The answer is here . All right , but no one goes near that rock or looks at it . - Is that clear ? - Well ... - Where do you think you 're going ? - Out ! Out to get what we came here for . We 've got bigger things to worry us now . I know ! Look , I ... I am sorry . But I can 't do your job . I 'm the geologist and you can 't do mine . And Alpha needs that milgonite . Maya ... I am sorry about Tony . Alan , keep him company . I 'll be right with you . Isn 't there any way we can reach him ? His brain is still alive . There 's ... there 's that hope , Maya . Right ... Well , that should do it . Er ... when I tell you , Alan , - that one . - Mm-hm . Is it reading ? - ( Machine clicks ) - Yo . Right , let 's have a look . Quartz , orthoclase , hornblende , augite ... olivine , feldspar ... ( Koenig ) No milgonite ? There has to be ! I checked the area thoroughly before I asked you to land here . The computer on Alpha confirmed it . - You couldn 't have made an error ? - No way ! I double-checked . The computer could 've malfunctioned . Now , that 's the human mind - doubt and disbelief . The computer checked out every component part of milgonite , and I read it straight . No ... Maya , will you be getting the microscope for me , please ? I want to have a look at this ... " rock fluid " on the slide . Now , hold it ! I told you , nobody cuts up that rock . Nobody looks at it . - We must , if we 're to help Tony ! - It 's too dangerous . The secretion won 't be as powerful , and with my molecular structure , I won 't be in as much danger . No , no , no , no , you don 't , little lady . The eyes of Texas are upon me . Er ... is it all right ? It 's only the rock fluid . I 'm just examining it under the microscope . All right . Would you mind ? Well , the little old Texas heart is still beating . ( High-pitched humming ) ( Beeping of monitor quickens ) ( High-pitched humming ) ( Koenig ) What do you make of it ? I don 't know . It 's not the source of power , or I 'd have been dead like Tony . Take a look yourself , Commander . ( Koenig ) Like blood corpuscles . ( Dave ) Yeah . ( Koenig ) Only they keep separating . I reckon whatever it is , it feeds the nerve system of the rock . Then the rock must be a living organism . The life form our sensor picked up . Oh , yes . It 's alive , all right . And lethal . Tony ? Tony ! What made the rock have the power to strike Tony , yet leave us alone ? - ' John . John ! ' - Yes , Helena ? - Tony 's gone . - What ? - ' He walked out of here ! ' - Then he 's alive ? No ... well , I don 't know . He must be ! - ( High-pitched humming ) - ' Helena ? 'Helena ! Are you all right ? Helena ! ' John ... I ... I think that that rock has control of Tony . 'John , I 'm scared . ' 'Stay where you are . 'You 're safer there until we find Tony . ' All right . Let 's split up . Let 's go . Tony ! Tony ! ( Beeping ) ( Koenig ) Tony ! ( All ) Tony ! Tony ! Tony ! Tony ! Commander ! Commander , over here ! He 's blown another piece of rock off . He 's been here . Tony ... Tony , can you hear me ? ( Crackling ) Helena ? You said he was alive . Helena ! Oh , yes , he ... he is alive . He came in here with a rock , he put it over there next to the other one , and they ... fused themselves together . That does it . We 're getting off this planet . - What about the rock ? - We must take it . We will , but we 'll dump it in space . - We must take it back to Alpha . - What ? I need to examine it . You need to examine your head . That thing goes . - Nothing - no response . - We got trouble up here ! All systems are dead . Eagle Four calling Moonbase Alpha . Eagle Four calling Moonbase Alpha . Come in , Alpha . Come in , Alpha . Nothing . Moonbase Alpha , this is Eagle Four . Moonbase Alpha , this is Eagle Four . ( Computer ) ' Minus one hour 45 minutes to lift-off . ' Eagle Four to Moonbase Alpha . Eagle Four to Moonbase Alpha . Do you read me ? ( Alan ) This is Eagle Four . Come in , Alpha . Alpha , are you reading me ? Alpha , perhaps you 're reading me but we 're not getting anything from you . ( High-pitched humming ) ( Alan ) .. in some way , can you contact us ? Alpha , We are getting no contact with you . There , you take that . There we are . Right ? Keep trying . ( Alan ) Eagle Four to Moonbase Alpha ... - How long 's it been pulsating ? - It just started . - Any change ? - No . He 's the same . That thing 's got to go . It 's too dangerous . John , Tony is still alive . Maybe we can find a way to break through to him . We 'll work on that outside . - Don 't go near ! It could kill you ! - So could old age . ( Alan ) Alpha , do you read me ? ( Helena ) John ! Alan ! I 'm all right . I 'm all right . - What 's happening ? - There was a blue light . The rock ... The rock hit me with a blue light . - It caused a paralysing pain . - Blue ? It 's yellow . It was blue . Yellow ... orange and blue . I wonder what colour kills ? - Did you get through ? - No , no , communications are dead . I wish it could tell us what it wants . Maybe it was trying to communicate ... say something . All right . Maybe it 's angry . Its natural habitat is out there and we 've taken it out of its natural habitat . Did we ? Or did it bring us to it ? ( Alan ) Maybe it brainwashed the computer into believing milgonite was here . Oh , boy ! That 's gonna make the cowboy jump for joy ! It took over Tony 's body , using him to slice off a piece of the parent rock to bring it back ... No . It had the biological powers to fuse itself . Maybe when it gets what it wants , it 'll release Tony . What does it want ? All right - one more time . What does it want ? I don 't get it . I 've brought in wildcat oil wells back on Earth , tapped uranium , but ... but this ... There 's been water here . Geologically speaking , there ought to be water . But the whole planet is like a ... It 's like a desert . What happened to the milgonite ? Don 't say happened , Maya . Think positive . There are clouds above that have dropped no rain . The hydrostat said so . I 'm not worried about the rain . Could be an ecological goof-up . - I 'm looking for milgonite . - Not on this planet , cowboy . What does that mean , astronaut ? Dave , your computer reading was right . But your source was all wrong . What do you mean , my source was wrong ? We think that rock programmed our computer to get us here on the pretence we 'd find milgonite . That rock has power , energy , intelligence and purpose . You 're talking as though it 's human ! It 's not human , but it is a life form . What we don 't know is its purpose . And Maya , I think you can help us find that out . If I could reach it . - I could save Tony . - Maya , wait a minute ! You 've seen what that rock can do ! - It can be dangerous . - Then why let her do it ? There 's no other way ! - You can 't think of one ! - Any suggestions ? - No ! - Give your mouth a rest ! Discussion ended ! John , I think she 's in communication . ( High-pitched humming ) If that thing really is alive ... and it 's talking to Maya ... then it 's off its guard . I was only seeing if our weapons could be effective ! - You fool ! - I had it on stun ! I wasn 't trying to kill it ! It 's a geological marvel ! Suppose it then killed Maya ? - I was trying to help Maya ! - To her grave ! I 'm sorry , Commander . I can 't communicate with it . It 's a life form . You can change into anything organic . - You should be able to communicate . - It refuses . ( High-pitched humming ) - John . - ' Yes , Helena ? ' The rock changed colour . It 's green . Helena , get out of there . That could be the death colour . ( Screeching ) - John ! - ' I told you to get out , Helena ! ' ( Koenig ) ' Helena ? What 's going on in there ? ' - It won 't let me go . - ' Are you all right ? ' Yes . It doesn 't seem to want to hurt me . It seems to be holding me hostage . ( Koenig ) ' Helena . Helena . You all right ? ' It seems to be searching for something . ( Screams ) I told you to get out of there . I can 't get out ! Helena ? We 're right close . 'Are you still held ? Can you get out ? ' - Door won 't open ! - ' Try to get out . ' Stay put . ( Piercing whine ) Try Computer . I can 't ! The green light stops me ! - Any pain ? - ' No feeling . Numb . ' I can 't move ! Helena . It 's moving around ! It 's exploring our storage supply wall ! - Go into the pilot section . - ' I still can 't move . ' It 's fixed itself on our water supply . The rock ... has absorbed ... all of the water ! 'That 's what it wanted ! ' Water ! It needs ... water to survive ! - Yes ... - ' And it 'll get it any way it can . ' I think I get the scene . The rock ... all these rocks , needed water to survive . These others are dead . Over centuries , they drained this planet dry . It didn 't have to commandeer our Eagle ! We could have taken it to a planet with water . When humans panic , they don 't think too well . Amazing ! Imagine the geological paper I can write on this ! Commander . The human body is mostly water . And Helena 's in there with that rock ! John , the green light has moved off of me . ( John ) ' Make a break for the door . ' I can 't get the door open ! ( Humming ) ( Click ) ( Engines roaring ) It 's lifting off ! ( Dave ) It 's taking the rock with it ! You 've got a one-track mind in a Stone Age skull ! Look ... All you can think of is that damn rock ! Get away from me ! It 's coming down ! Yes ! It can 't leave the rest of itself behind ! Helena ? What 's happening in there ? I don 't know . I don 't know . - What about Tony ? - ' No change . ' ( Rock hums ) The rock has begun to pulsate again . - What colour ? - ' Yellow . ' ( Computer beeps ) It 's taken over the computer . There are different star charts flashing on the screen . It 's looking for a place with water . It 's facing a deadline , like we are . Which deadline runs out first ... - its or ours ? - I don 't know . My guess is our friend has to get off this planet or it 'll die . We know that feeling . ( Koenig ) ' Are the star charts still flashing ? ' No , it 's stopped . The screen 's blank . We think that rock wants to get off the planet . If it is , Tony has to do his rock-gathering bit again . 'The second he leaves the ship , I want you to alert us . OK ? ' All right . Let 's move . All right . You two stay clear of the action . - We 'll take care of Tony . - What are you going to do ? We can 't let him take any more rock . - How can we stop him ? - Stun him . Maybe we can loosen the rock 's hold . You two , get behind those rocks . Alan , you come with me . ( High-pitched hum ) ( Comlock beeps ) - ' He 's out , John . ' - OK . Stay where you are . Make sure that gun 's set on stun . You too , huh ? You think the rock is all I care about . What happened ? The laser energy added to the rock 's powers affected his molecular structure . - ( Comlock beeps ) - Yes ? ( Helena ) ' John . Tony has reappeared . Materialised . ' He was transported ! We hit him with our lasers , hoping to loosen the rock 's grip on him . ( Groaning ) He 's moving . He 's making some sounds ! The sudden power surge has weakened the rock ! ( Koenig ) That means it 's most vulnerable now . If we can take Tony 's comlock , we can open that Eagle door . ( Koenig ) ' We have Tony 's comlock . We 'll try and open the Eagle door . ' I 've got his laser . Where 's the comlock ? Hey , cowboy ! He 's gonna do something stupid ! Tony ? Oh , Helena . What happened ? ( Computer ) ' Minus one hour 30 minutes to lift-off . ' Come on . Let 's get out of here . - Dave ! - Out , both of you ! ( Tony ) Quit your shoving ! ( Rock humming ) All right , now . Take it easy . You 'll be all right . - Tony ! - He 'll be all right now , Maya . ( Beeps ) ( Humming ) ( Koenig ) ' Come in , Dave . Come in , Dave ! 'Come in , Dave ! ' Come in , Dave . Come in , Dave ! Come in , Dave ! Maybe he 's dead . No . If it wanted to kill us , Helena would be dead now . He 's been taken over like Tony was . - He had to go charging in there ! - We owe him for that . It got Helena and Tony out . How are you doing ? This laser gun is taking longer to adapt than I thought . - How much longer ? - Not long . Will it work ? Four laser beams will be enough to dry up a reservoir . It 's a cinch to dehydrate the rock . Weaken it . Perhaps kill it . If we have to , then we have to . - Better get ready , Maya . - For what ? If that rock is using Dave , he should be coming out any time now . We can 't let Dave bring any of the parent rock back . That rock could become too powerful to beat . Alan , go to the Eagle . Tell us when he comes out . Here he comes . Maya , you know what to do . ( Computer ) ' Minus 15 minutes to lift-off . Range critical . ' Commander ! Help me ! Maya ! Get out of there ! I can 't ! It 's pulling me towards it ! You can break its grip ! It 's using most of its power to fuse me ! Break away now ! Break away now ! - The rock 's turned red ! - Red is death ! Red is death ! Use your laser gun ! Dehydrate it ! ( High-pitched humming ) - Easy , there . - It 's OK . You 're all right . How 's he ? He 's OK . Call Helena and Tony . We 're getting off this planet . Helena ? Tony ? Get back here now ! All right , Alan . Take her up . ( Tony ) It 's dying . Yes , it will in a couple of hours unless it gets water . It didn 't want to hurt us . It only wanted to survive . It 's too bad the clouds won 't give up their water in time . We can make them give it up ! Nucleoid active crystals . We 've got plenty on board . We can make it rain by dropping them on the clouds ! You set it up . John . We 'd like to drop nucleoid crystals into those clouds . Nucleoid ? - Maya ? - ' Yes , Commander ? ' - You all set , rainmaker ? - Yes , Commander . Jettison crystals . ( Thunder rolls ) ( Rock humming ) Well , we , er ... didn 't get away with any milgonite . No , but we got away with our lives . Here . ( Irish accent ) For milgonite , another time . ( Both laugh ) Alan , you think you can find our way back ? Can I ! Let 's go home .

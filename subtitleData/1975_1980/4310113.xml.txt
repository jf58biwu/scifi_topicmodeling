 What do you make of it . Victor ? Not much . It 's a new one on me . ( Communication on radio ) Paul ! It 's still not registering . Commander . 'Calling technician Anton Zoref . Good day. this is your alarm call . 'Duty period commences in 30 minutes . thank you . ' ( Alarm beeps ) ( Groans in objection ) ( Alarm continues ) Do we have computer identification yet ? Nothing . No indication that anything 's out there at all . I don 't like it . Paul. assemble all section heads . ( Bleep ) - Mark ! - ( Man ) Yeah . You 'll see there was one moment of high drama . A condenser blew on panel three . All yours . Anton . Sleep well . What is it . John ? I don 't know . There 's something out there we don 't understand . Main Mission . 'This is technician Zoref . 'Please acknowledge . Main Mission . 'Calling all stations Alpha . will someone please answer ? 'Emergency in generating area . please acknowledge . ' Please acknowledge . Main Mission ! And I ... I ... - That 's strange . What was I saying ? - I don 't know . Security alert in the generating area . ( Security alarm ) Generating area. this is Main Mission . Report. please . 'Technician Zoref . report your situation . 'Report your situation . ' He 's coming round now . - How do you feel ? - I 'm all right . What happened ? Something activated the security alarm . - Is everything all right in here ? - No sign of damage . Commander . I 'll check the area out . No. come with me . I want to know why you passed out . - I 'm all right . - You better go . Victor. this is one area we can 't afford to take chances with . Check it out thoroughly . ( Beeping ) You 're sure this has never happened before ? No . Well. not that I know of . ( Beeping stops ) ( Zoref ) What 's the matter ? It 's nothing to do with you . One of the monitors seems to have failed . - Am I clear then ? - Not quite . You 're still in a state of shock . And I 'm putting you on restricted duties . I 'm responsible for a lot of specialised equipment . And someone else will tend it for a while . I want you to rest and relax . ( Bleep ) - Dr Mathias . - ' Yes ? ' One of the medical monitors has blown . Could you fix it ? 'Yes . Doctor . ' The instruments have recorded a massive discharge of energy . Have a look . Fault in the reactor ? This energy force was outside the nuclear reactor . A radiation leak ? A fracture ? No sign of any radiation . Then what caused it ? Er ... That 's a good question . ( Beep ) 'John . I 'm taking Anton Zoref off full duty for a few days . ' Right . Is it possible Zoref has radiation sickness ? 'Nothing like that . Just a mild state of shock . 'I expect a quick recovery . ' I could check the last 24 hours ' scan records . Yeah. do it . Victor . If there is a leak . we 've got to find it . ( Gasps ) - Doctor 's orders were to rest . - I feel fine . Phew. it 's stifling in here . This is turned on full . Oh. yes . I ... I felt cold . ( Zoref ) No. leave it . But it 's far too hot in here . I said leave it ! Please . - What 's the matter ? - I don 't know . The lamp must have blown . Did Dr Russell check you thoroughly ? I 'm all right ! It 's just being cooped up in here . I need some fresh air . We could all do with a bit of that on Alpha . Well . I 'll have to settle for a walk down the corridor . That 's the scan record - quite normal. except for that . - What is it ? - That 's the energy force . It was recorded at the same moment that Zoref passed out . Yet all the systems in the generating area are functioning perfectly - no fractures. no flaws. no leaks . This is something entirely new to Alpha . If it didn 't originate on Alpha . which is what you 're saying . where did it come from ? There 's no energy source anywhere near us in space that could have caused that . There obviously is . How are we doing . Mark ? Fine . Pulled this place apart trying to find out what hit you . - How are you feeling ? - I 'm all right now . Did they find anything ? They took away all the monitoring tapes . Any idea what happened ? I see generator number four is ten days into a major refit . We can 't afford to reduce power output . Relax ! Everything 's all right in here . I 'm not very good at relaxing . Ergomania. it 's called - the compulsive need to work . ( Strained ) Mark ! Mark ! ( Shivering ) - Anton ? - I 'm ... cold . I 'm freezing ! Here . Drink that . Anton . What 's wrong with me ? ( Thud ) ( Beeping ) There 's nothing wrong with the machine itself . Dr Russell . It was the energy cells . They were completely drained . ( Beep ) The Commander is just coming . Victor. check for any signs of damage . What happened ? All we know is he died seven minutes ago . Death seems to have been caused by sudden freezing . I don 't understand . There is nothing in here that could do that . First Zoref. then Mark Dominix . There must be a connection . Helena . we 've got to find out what caused it and why . I 'll rush an autopsy but I may not find those answers . Doesn 't seem to be any sign of any damage . I 'll get Zoref to take over in here . No . I 'm making this a restricted area . Until we know more . run some more tests . Whatever we 're looking for must be linked to this generating area . Anton ? What 's wrong ? I asked you a question . Anton . Don 't come near me . What 's the trouble. darling ? Don 't come any nearer . 'Attention all sections Alpha . 'Special announcement . effective immediately . 'Access to the generating area is forbidden until further notice . ' What was all that about ? It 's Dominix . He 's dead . Dominix dead ? How do you know ? I was there . But what happened ? Eva. sit down . Over there . Please . Something happened in that generating area . Anton. you 're not in trouble . are you ? You 've got to trust me . Eva . Please tell me what 's wrong . I don 't know . I can 't explain . Please ! Don 't try to touch me . I 'm not well . I must see Dr Russell . - Let me come with you . - No ! I don 't want to get you involved . Promise to stay here . - But ... - Promise . All right . I 'll wait for you here . But if you 're sick . you will tell me. won 't you ? I 'll be back as soon as I can . ( Beep ) ( Bleep ) John. have a look at this first plate again . The one taken in the generating station when Zoref had his accident . - So ? - This one was taken at the moment of Dominix 's death . See ? Same energy force . You 'd accept a freak electrical discharge from space once . but not twice . It 's present when Zoref collapses and when Dominix dies . - Mmm . - It 's gotta be the connection . And this alien force is here . right now . Somewhere on Alpha . Are you all right ? ( Groans ) ( Screams ) ( Bleep ) - Same as Dominix ? - Yeah . You can take her away now . Whatever killed Hilary is no longer in the generating area . It was right here in this hallway . - Kano. what 's the power situation ? - ' It 's being restored now . ' What caused it ? 'Storage cells are exhausted - 'something caused a massive loss of power in that entire area . ' It 's hardly a coincidence . We see this freezing effect . Those two deaths were the result of total heat loss . Light is simply another form of heat . And in both cases. the loss was sudden and complete . Whatever this alien force is . John . it seems that it 's consuming heat . - Of course. that 's just pure theory . - But the best so far . Sandra. monitor all power levels on Alpha . - Report any fluctuation immediately . - Yes. sir . Paul . I want security patrols at every strategic location on Alpha . ready to move at a moment 's notice . and get Professor Bergman . ( Beep beep ) ( Bleep ) Dr Russell. where 's Anton ? He came to see you. didn 't he ? He 's here. isn 't he ? No . I haven 't seen him since I examined him . But he said he was coming here . Now. tell me what 's wrong . Eva . I don 't know . Anton 's sick . Something happened when he was with Dominix . Please find him . Doctor . I 'm afraid . 'I 'm concerned about him . John . I think you should check . ' Thank you . Helena . ( Bleep ) Kano. run a computer check on Zoref 's whereabouts for the last ten hours . Specifically. the last time he entered the generating area . Anton Zoref last entered generating area 20 : 45. lunar time . He was there when Dominix died . Find him . Paul . ( Alarm ) Commander. fluctuation in the energy levels . - Where ? - Section C. the solarium . Alan ! ( Breathing heavily ) Security . Solarium. we need help in here . Please come quickly . Hold it . Zoref ! No. the power . ( Wheezing ) ( Beeping ) He 's alive . I don 't know how . After absorbing almost all the power . We can 't leave him here . It 's too dangerous to move him . He doesn 't seem to be absorbing energy now . He 's safe . For the moment. at least . Get these to Professor Bergman right away . Yes . Doctor . ( Bleep ) Take him into the observation room . If there is a connection between Zoref and the energy losses . that connection is broken now . Let 's hope the scans give us the answer . ( Helena ) That light will act as an early warning system . Fine . But don 't go in there for any reason . First sign of any activity. call me . Oh. and Helena. there 's a security man right outside . Don 't worry . He can 't get out and I 'm certainly not going in . That 's it . That 's the force that killed Dominix and the girl . And it 's inside Zoref . I tried a computer analysis . Can 't recognise it . But it told me something else . This force has only been on Alpha ten hours. but it 's growing out of all proportion to the heat or energy it 's consuming . - Why Zoref ? - Who knows ? Could it be that it 's lain dormant in space waiting for Zoref ? A catalyst - something to operate through ? For what purpose ? Victor. we can speculate forever . But that 's not our problem . What we 've got to do is destroy that force while it 's still relatively weak . ( Creaking ) ( Bleep bleep ) ( Alarm ) Commander . emergency in the medical centre . All power gone . Automatic systems not functioning . Helena ! Open the door ! ( Bleep ) Look out ! Attention all sections Alpha . This is Commander John Koenig . Technician Anton Zoref 'has escaped from security in the medical centre . 'All Alpha personnel are warned that Zoref is highly dangerous . 'He is not. repeat . not to be approached . ' During this emergency all side arms are to be worn 'and if attacked. shoot to kill . 'Keep posted for further instructions . ' ( Bleep ) Paul . ( How quickly can we shut down all Moonbase power ? ) - You mean the reactors ? - No. the supplies from them . - That would take seconds. but ... - Survival factor ? In 20 minutes all our sick in the intensive care unit will die . In 30. our recycling plants will be damaged beyond repair . At 40 our oxygen will give out . ( Computer ) ' Alpha section B - power loss now critical . ' - Kano. you traced him yet ? - Not yet . Commander . Relayed all the affected areas not working . Victor. what 's the situation ? These are the areas affected so far . Severe power loss throughout this quadrant . See a sense of direction . We have Zoref on visual . He 's in Section C. Put it up on the big screen . Let 's see corridor 15 . Power in corridor 15 also failed . He 's at intersection 15 / 49 . Put up corridor 16 . Try 49 . He must be in 50 . No power in 50 . That 's it . There 's only one section left in that quadrant . - The generating area . - All the energy he needs . If he reaches that reactor . we 're dead . We 'll never stop him from getting to the other generating areas . Paul. alert security . generating area 3 . Tell ' em we 're on our way . Alan . Generating area 3. full alert . Do not approach technician Zoref . First energy losses in section F recorded . - Where ? - Corridor 53 . Attention F-section personnel . 'Technician Zoref is now somewhere in your area . 'You are warned to avoid contact . ' - What 's his last position ? - Approaching section F. Paul. cut the power . Cutting power now . Commander . Cut it . ( Chokes ) Disconnect him quickly . Get back . Get back ! ( Panting ) - I 'll try to cut him off . - OK. but watch yourself . Anton ! Eva . No . Come with me . Anton . We can help you . No . No . You must come away from here . There 's a chance we can help you . Don 't ... don 't touch me . It 'll kill you . - Go back . Anton . There 's still time . - Keep away . Keep away . Come with me . Anton . Keep away from me ! ( Cracking ) - No ! I want to stay with him . - No . Let me ... go . ( Moaning ) Let me go . ( Sobs ) - Down there . - Helena. you take her . - Don 't let them kill him. please . - Come on . ( Sobs ) ( Gasps ) Morrow ! What 's happened to the power in here ? All power 's been cut . Commander 's orders . But our patients are dying ! ( Man ) Doctor. doctor ! We need that power ! - ' Commander Koenig . ' - Yes . Our people are starting to die . In a few minutes it 'll be too late . Request permission to restore power immediately . Not until I say so . And that 's final . ( Sighs ) ( Cry of pain ) Victor ! It 's all right . It 's just not the best of climates for a clockwork heart . I 'm all right . Come on . ( Gasping ) Zoref. come away from there ! He can 't do it . He 's too weak . ( Cracking ) ( Groans ) Of course he had to go for us . We 're the only source of heat around . He 's alive . The laser - the laser regenerated him . We can 't stop him now . Paul. restore full power . Yes . Commander . ( Bleep ) Let 's get out of here . ( Panting ) ( Groan ) ( Screaming ) ( Screaming ) ( Screaming ) - Radiation shields . - Already activated . ( Explosions ) ( Explosions cease ) ( Koenig ) Check for damage and casualties . All sections Alpha . report your damage . ( Man ) ' Generating area G. reactors one and two stable . 'No sign of radiation leaks . 'Alpha section E. three casualties . 'none fatal . ' Power level stabilising . ( Man ) ' ... intact . Casualties zero . ' Victor. we 're gonna be all right . If that force had gotten to those other reactors ... Just one was enough for its purpose . Purpose ? Some sort of creative evolution . A stage in its development . Perhaps the beginnings ... A birth . A star ? Something like that . Everybody tried their best to help . We ... just didn 't know how . I don 't understand . Eva. we 're living in deep space . There 's so many things we don 't understand . We don 't know what that alien force was . why it came here . or why it selected Anton . But we 've got to try to help each other to understand .

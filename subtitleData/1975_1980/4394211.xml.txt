 What is it ? A service station . Some kind of half-way place . - And the time ? - The present . Inhabited ? I don 't know , I haven 't looked yet . Well , let 's look . - The time of day ? - 8 : 54pm . - What is the time of year ? - Summer , mid July . I wonder if there 's anybody running this place . There isn 't . Apart from us , there are only two other people here . And they arrived in that . I 've given it a visual examination but ... And the result of your examination ? I 'd say the car was manufactured in 1946 . - Mm-hm . - It 's no more than two years old . - Where are they ? - Hm ? Oh , they 're in here . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Mercury , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' - Do they go with the car ? - Yes . - Have you questioned them ? - No , not yet . I thought I 'd leave that to you . I 'm not very good at intimidation . Are they real ? I mean , do you believe them ? Well , I 've been given no reason to disbelieve them . So far , that is . A couple and a car . Two people and a machine driving here from 1948 . To this place ? To this time period ? I did say so far . Perhaps this side could be wrong . What do you mean , " this side could be wrong " ? Why not ? After all this seems just as perfectly set in its period as they do in theirs - but one side has to be wrong . - And this side ? Well , that 's also a little odd . Tell us . Silver , you 're supposed to gamble . Gamble ? Yes , sometimes - well , most times - you 're supposed to lose . Oh ! I wondered why I wasn 't enjoying it . I said tell us . I was standing here . I was told - you were told - there was going to be a time-break , so I was sent here to watch and to wait and then the car arrived . But the time-break happened before that . Did you see it arrive ? Well , I should say it appeared . I didn 't hear its approach . - Could you do it ? - Yes . Show me . I 'd love to . What on earth is it ? What 's your opinion ? Opinion ? You 've been here , what do you think is going on ? I think - I 'm almost sure - that there 's no time here . - Not any more . - You mean it 's stopped ? Yes . It 's a kind of a pocket , like a vacuum . Yes . You could say that there 's no time here any more . - Evidence ? - The traffic . - You can hear it . - Yes . The through road would be round about there . But listen to those sounds . The sounds are repeated . From when the time-break occurred . They are still travelling but they 're not going anywhere . - The time . - What about it ? - It 's still 8 : 54 . - Yes . It 's been 8 : 54 for the past six hours , ever since I got here . All the clocks are still working but they don 't tell us what the right time should be . You see ? Thank you . What 's normal time ? Normal time ? Yes , time as it is . You remember that . What is it ? Three minutes , 23 seconds after midnight . - And you 've been here for six hours ? - Roughly , yes . What does that tell us ? It happened yesterday ? When ? - I don 't know . - Perhaps the radio can tell us . Radio ? 'The referee 's mo ... The referee 's mo ... ' ' ... 54 ... be 8 : 54 ... be 8 : 54 ... ' ... be 8 : 54 ... ' Time as it should be for here . - But not for us ? - No . ' ... be 8 : 54 ... be 8 : 54 ... ' Are you going to show more surprise than your friend ? - Surprise ? - Yes . He didn 't show any . Well , suppose you tell us why we should be surprised . - Because we 're here . - And where 's here ? Oh , come on now . You represent authority and I suppose he sent for you . It 's not a crime . Whatever 's happened to us ... it can 't be a crime , can it ? - No . - Well , then . Reason with him , don 't argue with him . This is the future , isn 't it ? We were driving , minding our own business , suddenly we arrive here , into the future , without warning . That 's why we 're sitting here . We 're not making a fuss , we 're just sitting here , waiting , so that perhaps we may go back without warning . This isn 't a trick on our part , you know . It 's not some game , you may think it is ... No . No , we don 't think it is . Good ... because I know that this place isn 't a game . It 's ... Well , I suppose it 's how the future would feel . I mean ... It even smells and tastes like a different time . It scares me . When you were driving along and minding your own business , what happened ? She 's already said . Explain it . Explain it to us . We 'd taken the long-toll turning , it 's an old toll bridge road . There 's a small garage I know there , it 's only got one pump . They sell eggs and fruit , milk . Most people wouldn 't know it was a garage . Grass and weeds growing everywhere , chickens running under your wheels . But you can knock on the door any time , the old fellow will always serve you . - So , you drove in there ? - Yes . - Then what ? - It became this place . Suddenly . - Without any warning . - Were there any people here ? No . Then he arrived . - He wasn 't very helpful . - Sorry . - Time of day ? - What ? What was the time when you drove in here through the grass and chickens ? - It was nearly midnight . - Yes , it would be almost midnight . - And the date ? - The 25th of July . And the year ? 1948 . 'Do we believe them ? ' 'We can always do tests . ' 'If they 're not what they say they are ... ' 'Victims of the time-break . ' ' ... they could be part of it . ' 'I don 't see that . ' A large age difference between them . - About 14 years . - Hm . - But they are married ? - Oh , yes , they are married . But not to each other . Oops . As the catering staff seem to have deserted us , I 'll gladly cook some food . Can I get you something ? - No , thank you . - Surely , you ... We don 't trust it . We prefer to wait until we get back to our own time . - That might be quite a while . - We 'll still wait , thank you . - What about you ? - Me ? - He didn 't really ask you . - He doesn 't have to . - You must be hungry . - No , I 'm not . After that journey ? I mean , 30-odd years ! What about an omelette ? I can soon do a nice ham omelette . I 'm afraid that would constitute a meat meal away from home . Page three , paragraph nine of their ration book RB1 . - Half a coupon per person . - Oh , yes , of course . You do have your ration book ? We don 't want the food so you don 't get the coupon . Fair enough . But , if it 'll satisfy your curiosity . You talk about food , what about those ? Those plates ? Some haven 't even been touched . There are cigarettes and matches on that table . There are coats over the chairs but there are no people . You expect me to eat something and touch food here ? A glass of water , that 's all I want from this place . Because this place terrifies me . Hm . - This . - What about it ? - Do you know what it is ? - No . - It 's a calculator . - I don 't want to know . - All you do ... - Didn 't you hear ? - We 're not interested . - Not even in this ? Not even in that . What about all the other gadgets in here , aren 't you curious ? No . Things you 'll never have seen before . We are interested in only one thing - getting back . - Yes . - I think what he 's trying to say is , why don 't you take this back to 1948 ? You could invent it , make a fortune . We 're still not interested . Well , that 's good . The future should be left intact . Quite . But how many people would consider that ? I would expect people to take what they could from the future , to make the most of the experience . But not you . All you want ... is one glass of water . Yes . 'Out here . ' When you arrived , did you switch any lights on ? No , they were already on . Why ? If the time-break happened on a summer evening , why was every light left on in this place ? And there 's an image . Of a person ? Yes . An old man . In there . In another building . Well , a part of another building . Wait ! - That was the image you saw before ? - Same man , different background . What are you getting ? A sense of fear and violence . Isn 't it possible for a time-break , by accident or design , to pick up some powerful emotion from the past ? Like a side effect or follow-through ? - Yes . - Hm , I 'd agree with that . A small garage that sells eggs and fruit and milk . With grass and weeds growing everywhere . - July the 25th was a Sunday . - Yesterday was a Sunday , yes . - This small garage you drove into ... - Yes ? - Was it open on Sunday ? - I 've already said . It 's open all hours , any day . - Provided you knock on the door ? - That 's right . - What about at midnight ? - It 's no different . But the old man , how did you know if he was in ? Because he never goes out . I see . Anyway , he always leaves his lights on . All night long . A light burning in every room . He 's a sort of local joke . What ? A character . Ah . Why are you asking us this ? We 're in the wrong time , the wrong place . We don 't really need unnecessary questions . - Where were you going ? - Going ? Where were you going when you ... There are suitcases in your car . - Don 't answer him . - You looked , did you ? - Yes , I looked . - I said don 't answer him . - We don 't have to . - You do have to . If you want us to get you back into your own time . - To face whatever you have to face . - What do you mean ? ! - I don 't know , you tell me . - What do you mean ? - It 's obvious you 're running away . - Are we ? ! Don 't you think we 've had enough ? That 's odd , I was thinking of playing that machine . Oh , my God . Look ! - I was holding ... - Look . Look at the clock . It 's moved forward by ten minutes . Our bodies haven 't been affected , only this place has . So , what is it moving forward to ? To whatever is going to happen here .

 Commander . We 're getting a reading . - Eagle 1 in orbit and holding . - Twenty seconds visual contact . We have linkup with on-board computer . - Fifteen seconds to visual contact . - Eagle 1 holding . Eagle 1 breaking orbit now . Punch in long-range cameras . - Vital signs normal . - Alpha to Eagle 1. do you copy ? - Alpha to Eagle 1. do you copy ? - Keep trying . Paul . Eagle 1. are you receiving ? Come in . Eagle 1 . Preliminary results from on-board computer coming through . Good . Terra Nova . New Earth . Mm . Just what we 're looking for. isn 't it ? 'Resources to sustain human life ... unlimited . ' - Looks good . - Mm-hmm . 'Eagle 1 to Alpha . You won 't believe it but I think we made it this time . ' I 've seen rivers and trees . Lakes. mountains. valleys ... It 's just like Earth ! - ' Any intelligent life ? ' - That 's it ... 'The planet seems empty . It 's just waiting for us . ' No ! Eagle 1. this is Alpha . Do you copy ? Are you receiving me ? Come in . Eagle 1 . Contact lost . Commander . - Vital life signs ? - Not registering . Eagle 1. this is Alpha . Do you copy ? Are you receiving me ? Eagle 1. come in . Commander. flight pattern shows Eagle 1 on course and closing . - Systems functioning . - Vital signs normal . Emergency touchdown procedure . Yellow alert . Eagle 1 on final approach . - Flight pattern ? - Normal . Still on automatic . Emergency red . Set ? - They 're alive . - John ! I thought this was only a two-man crew . It was . What is it ? It 's my husband . You 're absolutely certain it 's him ? Yes . It doesn 't make any sense . No. it doesn 't make any sense . But John . I know my own husband . He 's been dead five years . Yes. he has. he 's been presumed dead . We 'll be in Dr Russell 's quarters . If there 's any change. let us know . Yes . Commander . Wasn 't he on the Astro 7 mission ? The Astro 7. yes . The mission failed . What ? They got locked in orbit around Jupiter . Something like that . They lost contact . As I remember. it was radiation . The ship burned up . I - I don 't know. they just lost contact around Jupiter . Helena. we 're billions of miles from Jupiter . John. we may be billions of miles from Jupiter. but Lee is here . He is here . Many things have happened since we broke away from our solar system . Unexplainable things . But this time . We might get some answers . - If he is ... - ' Dr Russell . ' - Yes ? - ' Something strange . 'Could you come to the care unit straight away ? ' Yes . - Checked the equipment ? - Yes . It 's functioning perfectly but it 's still not recording his vital signs . - How is he ? - Normal . Then why aren 't the instruments recording ? I don 't know . Let 's find out . Kano. what does the computer have on Russell ? Checks out . It 's him . Commander . Ah. just a minute . John ... The only information we have on Russell comes from his wife 's file . Now. that 's too limited . Analysis of the data does suggest that the planet is just right for us . Commander. the accident to the probe pilot puts phase two behind schedule . Paul. how much time do we have for phase two ? - Twenty hours . - Phase three ? A total evacuation of Moonbase Alpha will take 48 hours . Kano. if we cut phase two in half . How will that leave us ? We could do it sir. but only just . We 'll postpone phase two by 10 hours to give us time to check out Russell . People are wondering why phase two is not taking place now . Captain . I 'm not gonna jump the gun on this . I 'm not going to endanger the lives of any more pilots . Sir. it can 't be Russell . It just can 't be ! I repeat. until we know what 's going on. we do not go down on that planet . Lee ? Lee. can you hear me ? Uh. are ... Are ... you ... Helena ? Yes. it 's me . Lee . What ... is this ... place ? Lee. you 're in a hospital room . We 're on Moonbase Alpha . Helena . I came ... to ... you . I came ... because ... Victor. what do you think of it ? I don 't know . - But I 'll have a guess . - What ? Our instruments are designed to respond to human biological stimuli as we know them . But assuming Russell was on Terra Nova for five years . Then perhaps some aspect of that planet 's environment caused him to adapt in some way which our instruments can 't record . Victor. that 's good. but it doesn 't answer my immediate questions . How did he get onto that Eagle ? Did he have any affect on our pilots ? Can he be of help to us ? What does he know about that planet ? You want me to bring him out of it with metrazene ? I must talk to him . There are things about his condition that we don 't understand . Can it wait ? - Wait ? - A little longer. at least . In three days. we 'll be out of range . Every hour that passes lessens our chance of finding a decent home . There are 300 lives . Helena . Can you or I deny them that chance ? All right . That 's the maximum. sir . I can 't give him any more . I 'm Commander Koenig . I 've got to speak to you . Helena . It 's all right . Lee . I 'm right here . Commander Koenig is a friend . He 's going to ask you some questions . I must speak ... to Helena . It 's important to all of us . How did you get on that planet ? Planet ... What 's there ? Think . Try to remember . Helena ... called me . The planet. is it safe ? Only ... Helena ... It hasn 't worked . Helena. you try . I 'm sorry . John . He 's got to rest . All right. but you stay with him . Lee ? This place . Helena . Tell me . Tell you what ? This place ... Where is it ? We 're on Moonbase Alpha . Lee . There was an accident . The moon was blown out of Earth 's orbit . What do you want ? We think we 've found what we want . A new world. someplace to live . Your planet . We 're going to colonise it . We could be together . Kano. what 's the latest time prediction on phase two ? Hasn 't changed . We 've peaked your optimum take-off time . In two hours we must abandon phase two . - You said we had an emergency - Did I ? I must have been mistaken . Sandra. no bad news for me yet ? Nothing . Almost too good to be true . That 's nice . Oh . Commander . We are going down. aren 't we ? What 's going to stop us ? 'Commander. could you come to Dr Russell 's quarters. please ? ' Yes . What happened ? I found her on the floor of the care unit . - You all right ? - Oh . I 'm fine . I 've checked her over . There 's no damage . Thank you . Doctor . I must have passed out . Helena. it 's not like you to just pass out . Now. what 's wrong ? I don 't know . Lee and I were talking ... What ? He talked ? - Yes. a little . - What did he say ? Not much . It was just before I fainted . Did he talk about the planet ? I don 't remember . No . I 'm sure he didn 't . I would remember . Helena. you 're sure . Really sure he 's your husband ? Yes . I 'm sure of that . It just doesn 't make sense . I mean ... How do you feel ? Just a little tired. that 's all . John. we are going down there . Aren 't we ? When we 're sure it 's safe to do so . These are some thermographic scans I did of Lee Russell . Normally. they 'd have been passed to Helena for analysis . But Mathias was worried that they might upset her . You 'll see why in a moment . Now. as you know. these plates respond to body heat . There you are . Lee Russell . And from this . He seems to be perfectly normal . You can see the areas of body heat - brain. vital organs . And the cold areas. yellows . All just as it should be . Oh. that hand at the bottom of the picture. that 's Helena 's . But now. look at this . I don 't get it . Victor . - It 's not a living being . - Exactly. nothing there . No body heat. no reds at all . Just yellow . And yet. when this scan was taken. he was breathing. his heart was beating . And now. look at this . See. normal again . Is Lee Russell dead or alive ? I don 't know . According to that picture. he 's alive . And that one says he 'd dead . Take your choice . Course. this may be a symptom of his adaptation to living on that planet . I don 't go for that . Victor . He was on that planet five years . It takes billions of years for a human being to adapt that radically . So we 've always thought. on Earth . But we 're a long way from home . We 'll have to start thinking differently if we 're to come to terms with space . Victor. where was Helena for the second scan ? Not in the care unit . So she 's with him for the first and the last scan . And they 're normal . Then she leaves him ... and this happens . That 's right . Very strange. isn 't it ? Whatever life force sustains him . He 's drawing it from some outside source . From Helena . Helena ... Mr Russell. please . You should be in bed . I ... want ... Helena . - You 're not well . - I want Helena ! - Yes. in a moment . - No ! Lee Russell . Stop him ! Lee ! Lee. it 's all right . It 's time we talked . Take him to my office . Lee. try to help us . Help us to understand . Helena. stay away from him . - But why ? - Stay away . I know why you brought me here . - Good . - Then will you help us ? That 's why I 'm here . To help you . - Where 's Helena ? - It 's best not to see her . What are you doing on Alpha ? I ... had to come . Where did you come from . Mr Russell ? - The planet . - How did you get there ? - That 's not important . - How ? Commander . I don 't know how I got there. how long I 've been there . - How 'd you board our ship ? - You 're wasting time . Then help us . Mr Russell . Tell us what you know . I ... know ... you 're in danger. all of you . - From what ? - Is the planet inhabited ? No . Yes . Not in the way you think . You must not go near that planet . Mr Russell. we 're marooned . - We can 't survive indefinitely . - You cannot go down there . That 's our decision to make . You face power beyond your understanding . It will destroy you . What is this power. this danger ? Your ... opposite . It will annihilate you . Our calculations show that planet is perfectly suitable for human life . You ... don 't believe ... do you ? What can we believe ? You appear. and we don 't know how . You seem to be human. but are you ? You 'll ... go ... to that planet whatever I say . Isn 't that so ? Helena . Mathias . He 's dead . Victor. we 're running out of time . At least wait till we find out why Russell died . 'Commander Koenig . 'Essential we have flight coordinates for phase two probe . ' Not yet available . Stay on standby . - ' We 're cutting it very fine. sir . ' - I know how fine . Kano. thank you ! Victor. we 've gotta go . We 've gotta find out about Russell . For the sake of the mission . We must wait . Mathias 'll rush the autopsy . But I 'm not waiting for the results . I 'm starting phase two . - OK. but let me have an hour . - For what ? To run some skin tests on Russell . - Well. all right . - John ... Has Helena been told ? She knows . - ' Helena . ' - Come in . Helena . I ... I 've already said it all to myself . John . I don 't blame anyone . My interrogation could have something to do with it . Could have . We simply don 't know . The autopsy should give us some of the answers . As a doctor. of course . I 'm interested . As Lee 's wife . I 'd rather forget . The first time I lost Lee . I thought I 'd never survive it . Now that it 's happened again . I 'm just numb . I guess I never really had him back . I 'm all right . Reconnaissance section reports Eagle 2 on standby. equipment checked . Planetary data programmed into on-board computer . - Fine . Kano ? - Yes . - Have you made a new flight plan ? - We must leave in 30 minutes . Though it will cut our surface operating time to zero minimum . We need a definite time for phase two launch . Commander . John ... Victor . I 've made my decision . This is about Lee Russell . - Lee Russell is dead . - The skin tests ... Whatever he was. wherever he came from doesn 't matter . His influence on us has gone . Don 't you agree ? In that sense I 'd have to . But please. listen . But nothing stops us from going ? John. just hear me out . I put the skin data through the particle analyser . Now. his skin structure was normal while he was alive . But since his death. the atomic structure of his body is changing . There are signs of reversed polarity . And it 's becoming more pronounced . More complete . Reversed polarity ? That 's just speculation . Yes. but reversed polarity is the first step towards anti-matter . As soon as that process is complete . It means annihilation . - It 's just a theory . - Yes. a theory so far . But if ... Sorry. it 's not enough . That 's your decision . Yes. it is . - Alan . - Sir ? Phase two Eagle lift-off . 15 minutes . Right . Commander . Paul. activate Operation Exodus . Maximum alert . If phase two works . I want evacuation in minutes . They 'll be ready . Yes. we 're going down to Terra Nova . Now. we don 't know what we 'll find there . There 's an awful lot about the planet we don 't understand . At best. it 's a calculated risk . But there 's a chance . A chance to find a place to live . To raise families. to start again . Now. the landing party . Many of you qualify . But this is my choice . Captain Carter. we need a pilot . Paul Morrow . Analyst Sandra Benes . Dr Russell. will you come ? Yes . The landing party is under my command . We will rendezvous at assembly point three at 13 : 25 lunar time . Thank you . Victor . Victor . I 'd like you to stay back here . For any reason . If things don 't go too well . I 'd like you to take over my command . All right . Good luck . John . All pre-flight checks complete . Countdown continuing . 20 seconds to take-off . 'John. something very serious . ' - Eighteen seconds . - ' The autopsy on Lee Russell . ' - What 's happened ? - Sixteen seconds . - ' His body 's vanished . ' - Vanished ? - ' John. abort the mission . ' - On what grounds ? - ' Lee Russell 's warning . ' - Seven seconds . 'Anti-matter - the risks are tremendous . Five seconds . What do we do . Commander ? 'John. please . Reconsider . ' Sorry . Victor. we 'll just have to face those risks . All right . Captain. lift off . - It looks good . - Mm-hmm . Yes. it looks good . The computer agrees . Atmosphere 22 parts oxygen . 71 parts nitrogen . Outside temperature 23 degrees . Gravity similar to Earth . Please don 't approach animal life . No matter how harmless it appears . Don 't eat any vegetation without carrying out the appropriate tests . Paul. you and Sandra cover this hilly area to the right . Helena and I will take this wooded area to the left . Carter. you stay on the ship . Leave it under no circumstances . The rest of us will rendezvous here at 18 : 00 hours . If we 're not back . It means we 're in trouble . Right . As long as you keep your locator beams on. we 'll find you . Well. here we go . - The breeze . - The flowers . - Hey . Commander . Good luck . - Thank you . Carter . Commander ... Water ? Let 's find out . - No impurities . - Data readout normal so far . 'Have a drink on me . John . ' - Will you join me ? - I 'd be delighted . 'Clear. fresh water . ' Edible ! 'Sorry. that 's it . We 'll call you back in ten minutes . ' All right . I haven 't enjoyed a picture that much for a long time . Main Mission standing by . Paul. how are you doing ? 'We 're fine . No dangerous elements so far . ' OK . Paul. keep in touch . - Come in . Alpha . - ' John. we 've got trouble . 'Atmosphere seals are weakening . ' - All the seals ? - ' All of them . 'Including the plastics on your Eagle . 'Get Carter to check it out . ' Carter ? - ' Yes. sir . ' - What 's your situation ? 'Well. the insulation 's beginning to act up a bit . 'Doesn 't seem serious . ' Maybe not. but I 'm recalling the landing party . - Get ready for lift-off . - ' Yes . ' Helena. we 're going back to the Eagle . What 's wrong ? - Paul ? - ' Yes. sir ? ' - You two get to the Eagle . - ' But. sir . ' - Do as I say . - ' Yes. sir . ' 'It 's worse than we thought . John . The plastic seals are melting . 'Atmosphere screens are burning up . ' - We could use another Eagle . - ' Difficult . Can 't vouch for them . ' Carter . 'Commander ? I got smoke pouring from the instrument panels . 'All the seals on the ship are melting . ' Punch in on-board camera . Carter. get out of there ! 'I can 't get out ! All the systems have failed ! ' Carter ! We 're on our way . Let 's go . Paul . Sandra. quickly ! Sandra ! His laser exploded . Let 's get rid of it . Easy . Easy . Paul . He 's dead . Come on. come on . Here we go . OK. it 's all right . It 's OK . I cannot see . Helena. you stay with her . I 'm blind ! Come in . Alpha. this is Koenig . Moonbase Alpha. come in . Alpha ! 'The situation is deteriorating ... ' .. have gone in various areas ... ' .. evacuated ... 'We have many unaccountable technical troubles ... ' John ! John ! Hold on ! Helena ! Helena. where 's Sandra ? Are you all right ? Where 's Sandra ? Sandra ! - Sandra ! - Sandra ! Sandra ! Helena . We ... We almost made it . You ... and I. Helena . Helena . Lee . You ? I tried to stop you coming here . Help me. please . Lee . How is this possible ? The Astro 7 mission . You remember ? We were drawn into close orbit around Jupiter . Our heat shields burned up . We were affected by an unknown form of radiation . I suppose . It transformed us . Scattered us into deep space . And I became ... what I am now . Ended up here. on this planet . But you died . No. nobody dies . Matter never dies . It only changes its form . There are many forms of life in space and many forms of death. too . I 'm ... the image and mirror . The opposite of myself . Anti-matter ? If you like . But I couldn 't survive in your world . And you can 't survive in mine . That 's why you must leave. now . You 've seen what can happen here . It will get worse. much worse ! - You must leave. now . - How ? I 'll give you the strength . See what you want to see . We cannot stay here . John . 'Paul and Sandra are waiting in the Eagle. as instructed . ' Stand by . 'Fifteen minutes to lift-off . John . 'Operation Exodus ready when you give the word . ' Cancel Operation Exodus . Commander. you know those feasibility programs we 've been running ? Yes ? What about them ? Our present trajectory will take us past about ten million planets . It means we should pass near to 3.600 Earth-type planets . Statistically. that 's ten Earth-type planets for everyone on Alpha . And how much older will you be by the time we reach the first ? Not very much . Relatively speaking. that is . More to the point. how much older will you be when we reach the last ? 2.543 years old. to be exact. sir . - Just thought you 'd like to know . - Thank you . Kano .

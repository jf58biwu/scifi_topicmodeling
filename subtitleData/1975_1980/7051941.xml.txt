The Ground Search Party will be me , the copilot , one guard and Helena 's medical team . We 'll take Eagle 1 . Alan , take Eagle 2 . You 'll conduct an aerial search . Cover every inch within 100 miles of where that Eagle went down . - Got it ? - Yeah . I 'll need close photographic data , so take Sandra , if that 's all right ? Yeah , all right . But remember , first , search . Second , photographs . And third ... record any sightings of people , where they are and how many . All right . - I suppose you want me to stay ? - Yeah , I want you in command . You 'll get a chance to explore , but first things first . We 've got to find the Reconnaissance Party .

Eagle 1 , ready for liftoff . 'Eagle 1 , go . ' 'Eagle 2 , ready for launch . ' Eagle 2 , go . I wonder what happened down there . Will they find the Reconnaissance Party ? They haven 't got long . Three days and we 'll be past Ritha . If we 're going to settle we have until then . Looks good , doesn 't it , Ritha ? It did look good . I 'm gonna check with Bob Mathias about our Stone Age man . Eagle 1 to Base , landing all OK , moving out with the Search Party . 'Check . ' Eagle 2 to Base , I 'm centring my search from Eagle 1 's position . I 'm going north on the northern sector . Base to Eagle 2 , check . Eagle 2 ? Love to Sandra . You 'll be lucky . Here it is , their first marker ! From here on we walk . I knew it was too good to last . Eagle 2 to Base . Just completing first leg of the north-eastern sector . Returning south on a parallel course . Base to Eagle 2 , check . What 's it look like ? Well , it looks like the jungle in Brazil . Where the nuts come from - Any sign of life ? - No , not yet . There 's one or two small patches of mist , they just could be smoke . - ' Keep in touch . ' - Will do . Look at the size of it . John ... I think we 're being watched . Let 's go . Search Party to Eagle 2 , we 're moving into an area of mist . We 'll try and reach the Commander before dark . - ' See you tomorrow . ' - Check . Call up Commander Koenig , will you , Paul ? I 'd like to keep him up to date on the autopsy . Base to Commander Koenig . Base to Commander Koenig , come in . 'Base to Commander Koenig , come in , please . ' Base to Support Party , come in , please . Base to Support Party , come in . Base to Eagle 2 , come in , please . Base , I 've lost the Commander . Can you try him ? We 've lost contact as well . What was your last message ? Support Party wanted to catch up before dark . They were approaching some mist . Nothing from the Commander . 'How long does the night last ? ' Just over two hours . 'Right . Well , I 'll join Eagle 1 . 'If you hear from the Commander , let me know. out . ' Alan , down there ! I saw something moving ! I can 't see anything , but there is something odd about this place . Hold tight , I 'm going down . Alan ? Alan ! Alan ? 'Where are you ? You gave me a fright . ' I 'm having a look around . I 'm at the moon buggy . I 'm gonna follow them . 'Don 't be long , and be careful . ' Hey , all this concern . Paul 's gonna get jealous . Eagle 2 to Carter . Eagle 2 to Carter . Alan , where are you ? Eagle 2 to Carter . Don 't play tricks on me , Alan , please ! Alan , where are you ? Eagle 3 , ready for liftoff . 'Eagle 3 , go . ' 'Eagle 2 to Base . Eagle 2 to Base . ' Good morning , Eagle 2 . What 's the news ? I 've lost contact with Alan . He went out to have a look around and now ... nothing . Bergman 's coming down with David . 'We haven 't heard from the Commander or the Support Party . 'They 'll be there soon . Sit tight . ' Don 't worry , wild horses wouldn 't drag me out of here . 'Alan ! 'Is that you , Alan ? 'I 've been trying to reach you . 'Professor Bergman and David are coming down . 'They haven 't heard from the Commander either . ' I 'm sorry to go on like this but I 've been so scared out here on my own . Still , it 's good to talk to you , Alan . Alan ? 'Eagle 2 to Carter , 'are you receiving me ? 'Come in , Carter ! 'Alan ? 'Please ... ' Er , 10 minutes to landing ? I 'll let Sandra know . Tell her to put some lunch on . Eagle 3 to Eagle 2 , come in , please . Eagle 2 to Eagle 3 , receiving you . 'We 'll arrive in 10 minutes . ' Kano says put some lunch on , he 's hungry . I 'll be glad to . Hurry on down . I don 't want it to get cold . Sandra ? Sandra ! She 's got lunch ready . She 's not here . We were talking to her 10 minutes ago . Dr Russell ? Commander ? Oh , God , what has happened ? What is happening to me ? You ... must ... know me . Please ... help me ! 'Professor Bergman , report , please . ' Bergman to Base , it 's only just daylight . We 'll be moving on right away . There are some markers so we can see what we 're doing now . 'What news from Dr Mathias ? Any information would help . ' I 'll chase him up . As soon as we have anything , I 'll let you know . Any news of Sandra ? 'No , nothing yet . But don 't worry , we 'll find her . ' Kano , stop ! - What 's wrong ? ! - Avoid the mist ! I hate back-seat drivers . We 've got lights ! - The markers lead straight in . - I know . They 've all gone into that mist , the Reconnaissance Party , everyone . It was the last message . We 're moving into some mist . We 'll try and reach them before dark . - They all went in ? - Right . And none of them came out . Let 's go round on foot . Professor ! Be careful ! Over here ! Look . My God , look at the condition he 's in . He 's covered with blood . He 's half dead . John ? John ? John ! - What the hell are you doing ? ! - No , don 't ! - Are you out of your mind ? - I 'm beginning to wonder . Professor , look ! It 's a yellow sleeve , it 's Sandra 's . Look at it . Look at it ! It 's got blood all over it ! What have they done to her ? Those murdering savages ! I 'm gonna search this cave , every inch of it . By God , if they 've hurt her ... ! Sandra ! Sandra ! Kano , I can 't explain but I think that was John Koenig . - The Commander ? - We must go after him . We 've got to find him . You go that way , I 'll go this way , meet round the other side . Get through to Dr Mathias , I want everything prepared for the Commander . - Have the operating theatre ready . - Yes . He 's lucky to be alive . Whoever hit him meant business . Sandra ! Sandra ! Sandra ? Sandra ! Sandra ? Sandra ? Sandra ! We found you down on Ritha , thought we might have to operate . Lucky for you , you 've got a thick skull . What about the others ? Helena ... ? No sign of them at all . Just markers going into the mist . The mist ... Yes . We found a big cave down there where a tribe of cavemen seemed to live . Very interesting . They were going to bury one , and he wasn 't dead . But he was in pretty bad shape . The light wasn 't much good but I got a good look at him and for a moment I really thought it was you . - Family resemblance . - Uh-huh We 've got to go back down there . Oh , yeah . Got to find our people . You 're not going back down there . You 're confined to bed for at least a week . And in two days we 'll be out of range . Professor Bergman ... - Professor Bergman , Commander ... - Excuse me . The autopsy report . What ? He was a Stone Age man , all right , similar to our Cro-Magnon period , say 40,000 years ago , but he died of shock , his heart stopped , nothing else is wrong . But he had caps on his teeth . Caps on his teeth ? On the basis of this I made further tests . He 's one of ours . Sandoz . Sandoz was the Eagle pilot on the first reconnaissance flight . Skin type , blood group , fingerprints , everything checks out . I don 't understand it . Wait a minute , I think I 'm beginning to understand . If one Stone Age man turns out to be Sandoz , then maybe the one you thought was me ... was me . Oh , how ? How could it possibly ... ? Don 't ask me how but ... if it was me ... then maybe Helena and the rest of the Alphans are ... are also Stone Age people . It 's our own people who 've got Sandra ... My God , Carter . What ? Tell me ? Carter 's got a ray gun . If anything happens to Sandra ... - We 've got to go down there ! - We 'll go ! Bob , get my clothes . Sandra ! No ! No ! This way ! No ! No ! Alan ! They 're going to kill me ! No ! Helena ! Alan ! NO ! No , Alan ! Sandra . Back to the entrance ! Keep going . All right , run for the mist ! You three are decoys , but don 't go in the mist ! Victor , behind that rock . I 'm here . Force them into the mist ! - John , what are you doing ? - The answer 's in that mist ! Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! John ... ? Round the other side , quick ! - Helena ? - Victor ? John ! Oh ! We nearly lost you . Likewise . How are they ? Any ill effects ? Not at all . They 're all as fit as before we left . And no one remembers anything , I suppose ? Not first-hand . Only what Sandra 's told us . Damn ! An experience like that and no first-hand information . You go back 40,000 years and no one knows what it felt like ! Sorry , Victor . Oh , well , we 're out of range of Ritha now so we 'll never know . I wish I could remember . I 'd like to know how much we really have changed . Our instincts , basic emotions , feelings . By the sound of it not all that much . It seems cavewomen felt jealousy for the same reasons I would . I was quite flattered when I heard about that . Hmm . Victor , were there any other cave people besides us ? No , just you . Because we couldn 't speak , couldn 't communicate , we ... we misunderstood . We got frightened , angry , jealous ... - vengeful . - Yes , vengeful . To the point of killing . And yet it was only us there . Do you think we 've changed all that much in 40,000 years ? - You think we ever will ? - Maybe . Just maybe . I 'll let you know in 40,000 years .

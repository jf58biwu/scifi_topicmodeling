 Commander , we 're getting a reading . Eagle 1 in orbit and holding . - 20 seconds to visual contact . - Link up with on-board computer . - Fifteen seconds to visual contact . - Eagle 1 holding . - Eagle 1 breaking orbit now . - Punch in long-range cameras . Vital signs normal . Alpha to Eagle 1 , do you copy ? - Alpha to Eagle 1 , do you copy ? - Keep trying , Paul . Eagle 1 , are you receiving ? Come in , Eagle 1 . Preliminary results from on-board computer coming through . Good . 'Subject : Planet - Designated Code Name T erra Nova' - " T erra Nova " . New Earth . - Just what we ' re looking for . ' Resources to sustain human life ... unlimited . ' Looks good . ' Eagle 1 to Alpha . You won 't believe it but I think we made it this time . ' I 've seen rivers and trees , lakes , mountains , valleys ... It 's just like Earth ! - ' Any intelligent life ? ' - That 's it ... 'The planet seems empty . It 's just waiting for us . ' Eagle 1 , this is Alpha . Do you copy ? Are you receiving me ? Come in , Eagle 1 . Contact lost , Commander . - Vital life signs ? - Not registering . Eagle 1 , this is Alpha . Do you copy ? Are you receiving me ? Eagle 1 , come in . Commander , flight pattern shows Eagle 1 on course and closing . - Systems functioning . - Vital signs normal . Emergency touchdown procedure . Y ellow alert . Eagle 1 on final approach . - Flight pattern ? - Normal . - Still on automatic . - Emergency red . Set ? - They ' re alive . John ! - I thought this was only a two-man crew . - It was . What is it ? It 's my husband . - You ' re absolutely certain it 's him ? - Y es . - It doesn 't make any sense . - No . it doesn 't make any sense , but John , I know my own husband . He 's been dead for five years . Y es , he has , he 's been presumed dead . We ' ll be in Dr Russell 's quarters . If there 's any change , let us know . Y es , Commander . Wasn 't he on the Astro 7 mission ? The Astro 7 , yes . The mission failed . What ? They got locked in orbit around Jupiter . Something like that , they lost contact . As I remember , it was radiation . The ship burned up . I - I don 't know , they just lost contact around Jupiter . Helena , we ' re billions of miles from Jupiter . John , we may be billions of miles from Jupiter , but Lee is here . He is here . Many things have happened since we broke away from our solar system . Unexplainable things . But this time , we might get some answers . - I mean if he is your husband ... - Y es ? - ' Something strange , could you come to the care unit straight away ? ' Y es . - Checked the equipment ? - Y es , it 's functioning perfectly but it 's still not recording his vital signs . - How is he ? - Normal . Then why aren 't the instruments recording ? I don 't know . Let 's find out . Kano , what does the computer have on Russell ? Checks out . It 's him , Commander . Ah , just a minute . John ... the only information we have on Russell comes from his wife 's file . Now , that 's too limited . Analysis of the data does suggest that the planet is just right for us . Commander , the accident to the probe pilot puts phase two behind schedule . Paul , how much time do we have for phase two ? Twenty hours . Phase three ? A total evacuation of Moonbase Alpha will take 48 hours . Kano , if we cut phase two in half , how will that leave us ? We could do it sir , but only just . We ' ll postpone phase two by 1 0 hours to give us time to check out Russell . People are wondering why phase two is not taking place now . Captain , I ' m not gonna jump the gun on this . I ' m not going to endanger the lives of any more pilots . Sir , it can 't be Russell . It just can 't be ! I repeat , until we know what 's going on , we do not go down on the planet . Lee , can you hear me ? Uh , are ... - Are ... you ... Helena ? - Y es , it 's me , Lee . What ... is this ... place ? Lee , you ' re in a hospital room , we ' re on Moonbase Alpha . Helena , I came ... to ... you . I came ... because ... Victor , what do you think of it ? I don 't know , but I ' ll have a guess . What ? Our instruments are designed to respond to human biological stimuli as we know them . But assuming Russell was on T erra Nova for five years , then perhaps some aspect of that planet 's environment caused him to adapt in some way which our instruments can 't record . Victor , that 's good , but it doesn 't answer my immediate questions . How did he get onto that Eagle ? Did he have any affect on our pilots ? Can he be of help to us ? What does he know about that planet ? You want me to bring him out of it with metrazene ? I must talk to him . There are things about his condition that we don 't understand . - Can it wait ? - Wait ? A little longer , at least . In three days , we ' ll be out of range . Every hour that passes lessens our chance of finding a decent home . There are 300 lives , Helena . Can you or I deny them that chance ? All right . That 's the maximum , sir . I can 't give him any more . I 'm Commander Koenig . I 've got to speak to you . Helena . It 's all right , Lee . I 'm right here . Commander Koenig is a friend , he 's going to ask you some questions . I must speak ... to Helena . It 's important to all of us . How did you get on that planet ? Planet ... What 's there ? Think . T ry to remember . Helena ... called me . The planet , is it safe ? Just ... Helena . Only ... Helena ... It hasn 't worked . Helena , you try . I ' m sorry , John . He 's got to rest . All right , but you stay with him . Lee ? This place , Helena . T ell me . T ell you what ? This place ... Where is it ? We ' re on Moonbase Alpha , Lee . There was an accident . The moon was blown out of Earth 's orbit . What do you want ? We think we 've found what we want . A new world , someplace to live . Your planet , we ' re going to colonise it.We could be together . Kano , what 's the latest time prediction on phase two ? Hasn 't changed . We 've peaked your optimum take-off time . In two hours we must abandon phase two . - You said we had an emergency . - Did I ? I must have been mistaken . Sandra , no bad news for me yet ? Nothing . Almost too good to be true . That 's nice . Oh , Commander . We are going down , aren 't we ? What 's going to stop us ? 'Commander , could you come to Dr Russell 's quarters , please ? ' Y es . What happened ? I found her on the floor of the care unit . - You all right ? - Oh , I ' m fine . I 've checked her over . There 's no damage . Thank you , Doctor . I must have passed out . Helena , it 's not like you to just pass out . Now , what 's wrong ? I don 't know . Lee and I were talking ... What ? He talked ? - Y es , a little . - What did he say ? Not much . It was just before I fainted . - Did he talk about the planet ? - I don 't remember . No , I ' m sure he didn 't . I would remember . Helena , you ' re sure , really sure he 's your husband ? Y es . I 'm sure of that . It just doesn 't make sense , I mean ... - How do you feel ? - Just a little tired , that 's all . John , we are going down there , aren 't we ? When we ' re sure it 's safe to do so . These are some thermographic scans I did of Lee Russell . Normally , they 'd have been passed to Helena for analysis , but Mathias was worried that they might upset her . You ' ll see why in a moment . Now , as you know , these plates respond to body heat . There you are . Lee Russell . And from this , he seems to be perfectly normal . You can see the areas of body heat : brain , vital organs , and the cold areas , yellows . All just as it should be . Oh , that hand at the bottom of the picture , that 's Helena 's . But now , look at this . I don 't get it , Victor , it 's not a living being . Exactly , nothing there . No body heat , no reds at all , just yellow . And yet , when this scan was taken , he breathed , his heart was beating . And now , look at this . See , normal again . Is Lee Russell dead or alive ? I don 't know . According to that picture , he 's alive . And that one says he 'd dead . T ake your choice . Course , this may be a symptom of his adaptation to living on that planet . I don 't go for that , Victor . He was on that planet five years . It takes billions of years for a human being to adapt that radically . So we 've always thought , on Earth . But we ' re a long way from home . We ' ll have to start thinking differently if we ' re to come to terms with space . Victor , where was Helena for the second scan ? Not in the care unit . So she 's with him for the first and the last scan , and they ' re normal . Then she leaves him ... and this happens . That 's right . Very strange , isn 't it ? Whatever life force sustains him , he 's drawing it from some outside source . F rom Helena . Mr Russell , please . You should be in bed . I ... want ... Helena . - You ' re not well . - I want Helena ! - Y es , in a moment . - No ! Lee Russell . Stop him ! Lee ! Lee , it 's all right . It 's time we talked . T ake him to my office . Lee , try to help us . Help us to understand . Helena , stay away from him . - But why ? - Stay away . I know why you brought me here . - Good . - Then will you help us ? That 's why I ' m here . T o help you . Where 's Helena ? - It 's best not to see her . - What are you doing on Alpha ? I ... had to come . - Where did you come from , Mr Russell ? - The planet . - How did you get there ? - That 's not important . - How ? - Commander , I don 't know how I got there , how long I 've been there . - How 'd you board our ship ? - You ' re wasting time . Then help us , Mr Russell . T ell us what you know . I ... know ... you ' re in danger , all of you . - F rom what ? - Is the planet inhabited ? No . Y es . Not in the way you think . You must not go near that planet . Mr Russell , we ' re marooned . We can 't survive indefinitely . - You cannot go down there . - That 's our decision to make . You face power beyond your understanding . It will destroy you . What is this power , this danger ? Your ... opposite . It will annihilate you . Our calculations show that planet is perfectly suitable for human life . You ... don 't believe ... do you ? What can we believe ? You appear , and we don 't know how . You seem to be human , but are you ? You ' ll ... go ... to that planet whatever I say . Isn 't that so ? Doctor He 's dead . Victor , we ' re running out of time . At least wait till we find out why Russell died . 'Commander Koenig . ' Essential we have flight coordinates for Phase Two probe . ' Not yet available . Stay on standby . - ' We ' re cutting it very fine , sir . ' - I know how fine , Kano , thank you ! Victor , we 've gotta go . We 've gotta find out about Russell . For the sake of the mission , we must wait . Mathias ' ll rush the autopsy . But I ' m not waiting for the results . I ' m starting phase two . OK , but let me have an hour . - For what ? - T o run some skin tests on Russell . - Well , all right . - John ... - Has Helena been told ? - She knows . - ' Helena . ' - Come in . Helena , I ... I 've already said it all to myself , John . I don 't blame anyone . My interrogation could have something to do with it . Could have . We simply don 't know . The autopsy should give us some of the answers . As a doctor , of course , I ' m interested . As Lee 's wife , I 'd rather forget . The first time I lost Lee , I thought I 'd never survive it . Now that it 's happened again , I ' m just numb . I guess I never really had him back . I ' m all right . Reconnaissance section reports Eagle 2 on standby , All equipment checked and loaded . Planetary data programmed into on-board computer . - Fine . Kano ? - Y es . Have you made a new flight plan ? We must leave in 30 minutes . Though it will cut our surface operating time to zero minimum . o. k . We need a definite time for phase two launch , Commander . John ... - Victor , I 've made my decision . - This is about Lee Russell . - Lee Russell is dead . - The skin tests ... Whatever he was , wherever he came from doesn 't matter . His influence on us has gone . Don 't you agree ? In that sense I 'd have to , but please , listen . But nothing stops us from going ? Just hear me out . I put the skin data through the particle analyser . Now , his skin structure was normal while he was alive . But since his death , the atomic structure of his body is changing . There are signs of reversed polarity . And it 's becoming more pronounced , more complete . Reversed polarity ? That 's just speculation . Y es , but reversed polarity is the first step towards anti-matter . As soon as that process is complete , it means annihilation . - It 's just a theory . - Y es , a theory so far . - But if ... - Sorry , it 's not enough . That 's your decision . Y es , it is . - Alan . - Sir ? - Phase two Eagle lift-off , 1 5 minutes . - Right , Commander . Paul , activate Operation Exodus , maximum alert . If phase two works , I want evacuation in minutes . They ' ll be ready . Y es , we ' re going down to T erra Nova . Now , we don 't know what we ' ll find there . There 's an awful lot about the planet we don 't understand . At best , it 's a calculated risk . But there 's a chance . A chance to find a place to live , to raise families , to start again . Now , the landing party . Many of you qualify . But this is my choice . Captain Carter , we need a pilot . Paul Morrow . Analyst Sandra Benes . Dr Russell , will you come ? Y es . The landing party is under my command . We will rendezvous at assembly point 3 at 1 3 : 25 lunar time . Thank you . Victor . Victor , I 'd like you to stay back here . If things don 't go too well , I 'd like you to take over my command . All right . Good luck , John . All pre-flight checks complete . Countdown continuing . 20 seconds to take-off . - ' John , something very serious . ' - Eighteen seconds . - ' The autopsy on Lee Russell . ' - What 's happened ? - Sixteen seconds . - ' His body 's vanished . ' Vanished ? 'John , abort the mission . ' - On what grounds ? - ' Lee Russell 's warning . ' Seven seconds . 'Anti - matter - the risks are tremendous . Five seconds . What do we do , Commander ? 'John , please . Reconsider . ' Sorry , Victor , we ' ll just have to face those risks . All right , Captain , lift off . - It looks good . - Y es , it looks good , the computer agrees . Atmosphere 22 parts oxygen , 7 1 parts nitrogen , outside temperature 23 degrees , gravity similar to Earth . Please don 't approach animal life , no matter how harmless it appears . Don 't eat any vegetation without carrying out the appropriate tests . Paul , you and Sandra cover this hilly area to the right . Helena and I will take this wooded area to the left . Carter , you stay on the ship . Leave it under no circumstances . The rest of us will rendezvous here at 1 8 : 00 hours . If we ' re not back , it means we ' re in trouble . Right . As long as you keep your locator beams on , we ' ll find you . Well , here we go . - The breeze . - The flowers . - Hey , Commander . Good luck . - Thank you , Carter . Look ! Commander ... Water ? Let 's find out . - No impurities . Data readout normal so far . ' Have a drink on me , John . ' - Will you join me ? - I 'd be delighted . 'Clear , fresh water . ' Edible ! 'Sorry , that 's it , we ' ll call you back in ten minutes . ' All right . I haven 't enjoyed a picture that much for a long time . Main Mission standing by . - Paul , how are you doing ? - ' Nothing dangerous so far . ' OK , Paul , keep in touch . - Come in , Alpha . - ' John , we 've got trouble . 'Atmosphere seals are weakening . ' - All the seals ? - ' All of them . 'lncluding the plastics on your Eagle , get Carter to check it out . ' - Carter ? - ' Y es , sir . ' What 's your situation ? 'Well , the insulation 's beginning to act up a bit , doesn 't seem serious . ' Maybe not , but I ' m recalling the landing party . - Get ready for lift-off . - ' Y es . ' Helena , we ' re going back to the Eagle . What 's wrong ? - Paul ? - ' Y es , sir ? ' - You two get to the Eagle . - ' But , sir . ' - Do as I say . - ' Y es , sir . ' ' It 's worse than we thought , John . The plastic seals are melting . 'Atmosphere screens are burning up . ' - We could use another Eagle . - ' Difficult . Can 't vouch for them . ' - Carter . - ' Commander ? Smoke is pouring from the instrument panels.the seals are all melting . ' Punch in on - board camera . Carter , get out of there ! ' I can 't get out ! All the systems have failed ! ' Carter ! We ' re on our way . Let 's go . Paul , Sandra , quickly ! His laser exploded . Let 's get rid of it . Easy . Easy , Paul . He 's dead . Come on , come on . Here we go . - OK , it 's all right . It 's OK . - I cannot see . Helena , you stay with her . - l ' m blind ! - Okay . Come in , Alpha , this is Koenig . Moonbase Alpha , come in , Alpha ! 'The situation is deteriorating have gone in various areas evacuated ... 'We have many unaccountable technical troubles ... ' John ! John ! Are you all right ? Where 's Sandra ? We ... We almost made it . You ... and I . Lee . You ? I tried to stop you coming here . Help me , please , Lee . How is this possible ? The Astro 7 mission . You remember ? We were drawn into close orbit around Jupiter . Our heat shields burned up and we were affected by an unknown form of radiation , I suppose . It transformed us , scattered us into deep space . And I became ... what I am now . Ended up here , on this planet . But you died . No , nobody dies . Matter never dies . It only changes its form . There are many forms of life in space and many forms of death , too . I ' m ... the image and mirror , the opposite of myself . - Anti - matter ? - If you like . But I couldn 't survive in your world . And you can 't survive in mine . That 's why you must leave , now . You 've seen what can happen here , it will get worse , much worse ! - You must leave , now . - How ? I ' ll give you the strength . See what you want to see . We cannot stay here , John . ' Paul and Sandra are waiting in the Eagle , as instructed . ' Stand by . ' Fifteen minutes to lift-off , John . 'Operation Exodus ready when you give the word . ' Cancel Operation Exodus . You know those feasibility programs we 've been running ? Y es ? What about them ? Our present trajectory will take us past about ten million planets . It means we should pass near to 3 , 600 Earth-type planets . Statistically , that 's ten Earth - type planets for everyone on Alpha . And how much older will you be by the time we reach the first ? Not very much . Relatively speaking , that is . More to the point , how much older will you be when we reach the last ? 2 , 543 years old , to be exact , sir . - Just thought you 'd like to know . - Thank you , Kano .

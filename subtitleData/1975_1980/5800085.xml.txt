 Nanu , nanu . Shazbot . ( opening musical theme plays ) Orson calling Mork . Orson calling Mork . Come in , Mork . Orson ? Is that you ? Of course it 's me . Who else has your number ? Oh . That 's right , I forgot . I 've got unlisted mind . What 's up , great cosmic intruder ? It seems the report of your first week on Earth was accidentally destroyed . Oh , a likely story . Trying to pull a Nixon on me , eh ? I thought all those reports were stored on micro-wire cassette . They are . However , your superiors were chewing caramels and used that report to floss their teeth . Good thing Jimmy Carter wasn 't there or we 'd have lost the entire file . Mork ... Sir . I want you to activate your Orkan total recall and duplicate your report . Gotcha . Lights , camera , action ! Mork ? Ready when you are , C.B. MINDY : Hey , Mork , are you up ? Come on , get up . ( singsongy ) : Come and get it ! I hope you like corn flakes . Why wouldn 't I ? Just because I 'm from another planet doesn 't mean I 'm that different . Trust me , you are different . ( Orkan sounds ) Okay . Come on , let 's have a little breakfast . May I be of some assistance ? Oh , sure , uh ... I guess you could set the table . ( monotonous hum ) Where would you like me to set it ? Hurry up , I 'm getting a cramp in my finger . Just set it back where it was . ( speaking in reverse ) Nice way to build up an appetite . I 'm so hungry I could eat a Flizbit . Well , today is going to be a big day . Today we 're going to find you a new place to live . Why can 't I go on living with you ? Well , because my father is a conservative , puritanical ... mm ... Nerd . That 's it . You got it . Ah ! ( sizzles ) What is this black liquid ? This is coffee . What do you do with it ? We have it with our breakfast . Oh , allow me . Oh , repulsive . You know , Mork , the more I think about it , I think that we 'd better keep where you come from a secret . I hate to admit this , but people here on Earth get pretty hassled over anything they don 't understand . Oh . Why would anyone think I 'm weird ? We must save two to build a new race . Swim , you little nimnuls . I hope the rest can tread coffee . You know , I still can 't get over this . I 'm sitting here having breakfast with a being from another planet . What a coincidence . So am I. You know , there 's so much we can learn from each other . Starting with me teaching you to act human so you don 't get into any more trouble . Oh , yeah , and another thing , I 've got to find you a job . A job ? Yeah , work , you know , like I work at the music store with my dad and my grandma . Oh , I was sent to observe Earth and report back everything to Orson on Ork . That 's my job . No , I mean like a job that pays money . Oh . You do understand the concept of money , don 't you ? Mindy , I am surprised at you . I am a member of a highly advanced civilization . My superiors on Ork thought of everything . Going down . Coming up . I bring with me untold wealth of the Universe . Wow , this looks heavy . What 's in here ? Look . Oh , oh , careful , my bank 's closed . This is sand . Yes , it 's been in my family for years . But , Mork , on-on Earth , sand is as common as , uh , dirt . Well , there goes bag two . Oh , but I realize my superiors might be nimnuls and I brought along something of unquestioned value throughout the universe . What ? A credit card . I don 't leave home without it . FRED ( humming ) : ♪ Um-pum ... ♪ Andante , andante , you butchers . Andante ! Hey , Toscanini , knock it off ! Do you know what that looks like from out there ? That looks like you 're out of your gourd . Back , back , back ! You 're blocking the violins . Get back . ♪ Bomp , bomp , bomp , bomp , bomp ... ♪ What did you do that for ? You interrupted my sforzando . Now , now , don 't get your Brahms in an uproar . Why do I have to put up with you ? After all , it 's my store . Lord , why did you create mothers-in-law ? So they can work in the family store and ring up 83 % of the sales . You 're wretched . Go ahead , Freddy , whip me with your words . Has Mindy come in yet ? Mindy ? No . No , she 's probably hanging around with that absurd yo-yo . I 'm worried , Cora . I 'm scared to death it could become something serious . After all , he 's already spent the night with her . Oh , he stayed in her house . There 's a big difference . But that 's the first step towards moving in . As far I know , he 's over there right now . Well , you could pick up that phone and find out in a second . Oh , I couldn 't do that . It would be too much like spying , as if I didn 't trust her . No . I could never bring myself to stoop so low . Oh , Freddy , you underestimate your potential . ( telephone ringing ) MINDY : Mork , will you answer that ? ( telephone ringing ) Ring ... Ring ... Ring ... Please get the telephone . Oh , phone . ( telephone ringing ) Primitive means of audio communication . ( telephone ringing ) I wonder what it looks like . Hello . Hello ! ( ringing ) I killed it . Hello . Hello . Yeah , hello ? Hello ? Hel ... hel ... hel ... Hello ! I knew it . He 's there . Now don 't try to stop me , Cora . Nobody is going to corrupt my daughter ... until after she 's married . He 's such a wiener . Mork , on Earth , a gentleman always helps a lady on with her coat . ( humming ) Thank you . Uh , on Earth , a gentleman also lets go of the coat . Keep your hands off that child . Daddy , he was just helping me on with my coat . What are you doing here ? Me ? What are you doing here ? Now , I don 't want any stories or any excuses . I want the plain , unvarnished truth . I spent the night . Couldn 't you have varnished it just a little ? Daddy , it 's not like it seems . The only reason Mork spent the night here last night was because , uh ... uh ... Well , I can 't tell you that ; it 's a secret . Secret ? Secrets . We never had secrets from each other . Now , I demand to know what 's going on between the two of you . After all , I love you . Oh , that 's nice . Daddy , I am going to tell you something that you might find hard to believe . But you 've got to promise not to breathe a word of this to anyone . Okay , okay , I promise . Mork is from Ork . It 's another planet . ( guffawing ) Mindy , I 'm your father . You can do better than that . Mork , do something . Show Daddy you 're from Ork . Watch this , Daddy ... a little cosmic shtick . Many bleams ago , we Orkans realized the need to talk while drinking . Boy , am I thirsty . I 'd like to see a human do that . ( burps ) Look , I-I don 't know how you did that , but it 's , uh , some kind of trick . It doesn 't prove anything . Perhaps these color slides from Ork will . Uh , what 's this supposed to be ? Frizbot , the capital . Looks completely black . It 's the inner city . Look , fella , you can 't fool me . Everybody knows what space creatures look like . They have huge bald heads . Not always . Everybody knows that space creatures are always green . Oh , you mean the old cliché ... like this . ( shrieks ) Nauseating , isn 't it ? It 's not easy being green . You 're an alien ! You 're an alien ! ( orkan sound ) Are you on vacation , or did you come down here to snatch a body ? No , no , no , no , I didn 't mean that . Daddy , Mork is from a highly advanced civilization . They did away with violence ages ago . Not only that . I like you . Aw ... Oh , well , I like you , too , son . Burn that . Um , look , would you mind if I talk to my daughter in private ? No offense , I mean it 's not worth a death ray or anything like that . Death ray ? Oh , humor . ( seal-like laugh ) Right on , Pops . What it was . I like Ike . Just gonna clean up the old room . Isn 't that something else ? Mindy , let 's have a father-daughter talk . Oh , sure . ( shouting ) : Get rid of him ! Trash day . MINDY : We walk all over Boulder , and we still don 't find you an apartment . Oh , don 't worry , Mork , we 'll find you a place to live . I saw a nice tree in the front yard . I could hang out there tonight . Oh , no , I wouldn 't put an Orkan out on a night like this . You 'll just have to spend another night , that 's all . Good . I guess it 's time to hit the old coat rack , then . Oh , Mork , not the armoire . You 're on Earth now ... you might as well start acting a little more like it , right ? True . Where do you sleep ? On a bed . Boy , have you got a lot to learn . Good , I 'll sleep with you . I 'm always willing to learn . Why don 't you just sleep on the sofa tonight ? Oh . On a flat surface ? Won 't I get dizzy ? Well , you won 't have far to fall . Oh , Mork , could you go up in the attic for me and get the old comforter ? Oh , kay-o . That 's " okay . " You thank . " Thank you . " You 're welcome . Oh , if you have any trouble finding it , it 's in the middle of the attic behind the old trunk . Got it ? MORK ( goofy voice ) : Ah-bad nee-bay . Bad-ah nee . Which one 's the comforter ? I do hope it 's this one . See , my comforter doesn 't stare . ( chuckles ) Never mind , I 'll get it later . Nice place , your attic . Nice ? It 's dark , dusty and full of spiders . Blech ! My kind of town . It 's perfect . Could I live there ? You know , actually , that attic wouldn 't be such a bad place if we fixed it up . You know , it would be like having your own apartment . And it would be a perfect place for you to stay while you 're adjusting to Earth . It 'd be perfect . Oh . Except for Daddy . He and I are having enough problems as it is . Stay . Problems ? Yeah . May I be of some assistance ? I 'm afraid not . You see ... you are the problem . Me ? Yeah . Daddy made me promise to have you moved out by tonight ... or else . Oh , I see . I didn 't want to cause trouble . Well , I must be leaving . Well , where are you going ? You can 't go now ... it 's cold out and it looks like rain . I 'll be fine . I 'm into weather . I will miss you . Oh , wait , wait , Mork . I don 't want you to go . You see , until I met you , I ... I never realized how dull and boring my life has been . I mean , you 're a man from outer space . That 's exciting ! Exciting . Oh ... ( screams ) I told you , stay ! I 've never been called exciting before . Well , you are . I mean , think of it ... you 're a ... you 're an ambassador from another planet . I mean , you 're important . And if I can help you , that ... ( laughs ) that makes me feel important . Well , the important thing is the relationship between you and your father . I envy you that you have one . My father was an eyedropper . My mother was a sterile dish . Hard to warm up to old Mom . Yeah , but , Mork , it 's time that I ... It 's best for you if I leave , but ... I can come back from time to time and take human lessons from you . You 're already acting more human than a lot of people I know . I have a solution . What ? I 'll call your father and tell him I 'm leaving . Oh ... What 's his number ? 555-0694 . ( makes beeping sounds ) ( line ringing ) It 's ringing . Mr. McConnell , Mork here . No , sir , that 's not quite right . I 'm a son of a test tube . No , no , um ... I just want to say , uh , I don 't want to stand between you and Mindy . No , you won 't be seeing me anymore . I thought it 'd be nice if you came over and made up with Mindy . Yes , sir . Good-bye . There are some words I have to ask you about . He 's coming over . I ... I 'd better be going . Oh , Mork , I feel so sad . Oh ... Oh ... You 're soft . I could get to like that . Well , you just ... can 't just walk out . I mean , not just like that . I know ... we 'll have a toast , uh , to your new life . I 'll break out the bubbly . Bubbly ? Champagne . ( like Lawrence Welk ) : Oh . Thank you , thank you , let 's all get down , get funky . The lovely Lemmon Sisters gonna sing " I Can 't Get No Satisfaction . " Except in this case , the champagne has to be ginger ale because that 's all I have . Oh . Well ... here 's to ... the nicest alien I 've ever met . And here 's to the nicest alien I 've ever met . And the softest . ( chuckles ) ( goofy muttering and chuckling ) ( shrieks , goofy singing ) ( continues goofy singing ) ( raspberry ) ( yells like Tarzan ) ( goofy shout ) Are you all right ? Certainly I 'm all right . ( goofy , childlike shouting ) Oh , wow ! Surf 's up ! Ha-ha ! ( slow motion ) : Oh , no ! What 's the matter ? I think I 'm getting Bezurb . What ? ( deep , wavering moan ) : Oh , oh , oh , oh ... The carbonation hits my bloodstream and I get Ork-faced . ( goofy singing ) ( shrieking ) Going home , Mama ! Waah ! You 're drunk ! Hey , don 't take away my gusto ! ( goofy shout ) ( like Wicked Witch ) : Oh , help me , I 'm melting ! ( laughing ) ( goofy singing ) I can 't believe this . I got to sober you up . Come on . ( doorbell rings ) FRED ( calling ) : Mindy ... I 'll get it . No ! You 've got to hide . Oh , Moo-moo ... No , you got to ... Shh , shh , shh . Woop . Stairway to the stars ! Shh ! Oh ... uh ... Oh , hello , Daddy . Hi , honey . I hate to barge in like this , but Mork called , and I kind of got to thinking about the way I acted . I was out of line , Mindy , and I want to apologize . Oh , Daddy , you don 't have to apologize . You don 't have to say another thing . Well , I know I didn 't have to , but I wanted to . You know , it 's not easy being a father , Mindy . I know . Someday you 'll be a father ... you 'll understand . Yeah . ( yawns ) Oh , I 'm really getting bushed . It 's getting late . I 'd better get ... Oh , yeah , it 's , uh , nearly ... 7 : 30 ? But , then again , it 's ... not very often we get to have these little father-and-daughter talks . You know what I mean , Dad ? Just sit down right over here . You know , honey , I 'm sorry if I 'm a little overprotective about you and your boyfriends , but this Mork , I mean , he 's a yo-yo , he 's some sort of a creature from outer space . Well , I know that 's a strike against him , but he 's really not that different . You should just take a , you know , a closer look at him sometime . Oh , is that so ? Well , why don 't you take a really close look ... ( screams ) Aw , bummer . What 's he doing here ? ! Now , Daddy , don 't get excited . I can explain . You lied to me ! You broke your promise ! ( growling ) Down , boy . Down . Heel , heel . Sit ! Sit ! Well , I didn 't break my promise , but you bullied me into that promise , you know . I bullied you into it ? Well , I 'm a father ! What are fathers for ? Well , you 're just not gonna do it anymore , Dad , that 's all . I 'm 21 years old , I have my own apartment , I 'm a grown woman , and if I feel like it , I 'm going to keep an Orkan in my attic . Well , I don 't feel like it ! So , in other words , what you 're asking is that I choose between you and Mork ? Right . Well , don 't force me to make that choice , Dad . I 'm forcing you . Mork stays . Good night , Daddy . Good night , Daddy . ( honks horn ) Moo-moo says hi , too . I 'm warning you , if I leave here , I 'm never coming back . Never ! If that 's the way you feel . ( door slamming ) On the other hand , never is much too long . Oh , honey . Oh , Daddy . Oh . Thanks . Oh ... Oh , good , you two are back together . Mork , you 're sober . Oh , yes , we Orkans only stay bezurb for 60 seconds . Well , you were gone for a good five minutes . Whew ! I was out for a long time . Yeah . Must 've really hung one on . You mean , he 's still staying here tonight ? Yes , Daddy , but nothing is going to happen . Do you believe that ? Of course I do , honey . You gave me your word , and I trust you . Thank you . But I don 't trust him . I 'm staying the night . Oh , good ... company . Well , you can have my place , Pops ... and I 'll camp out . Mork calling Orson . Come in , Orson . ( slow motion ) : Mork calling Orson . Come in , Orson . ( slower ) : Mork ... calling ... Orson . Come in ... Orson . ORSON : Orson to Mork . Am I coming in loud and clear ? Uh , too loud , too clear . You 're coming in fuzzy . What 's the matter with your head ? Oh , I 'm sending fuzzy . I think I got a little bezurb last night . You 're supposed to be observing the planet , not running around getting Ork-faced . How 's the sand holding out ? I 've been meaning to talk to you about that , Orson . I found a very safe place to put it ... a cat box . But that 's a ... Yes . That 's what it 's worth here , Orson . Haven 't you found out anything important ? Yes . Believe it or not , trees are green on Earth . There 's a black liquid that sells for three dollars a pound , and it takes two to tango . I mean , something really important . Yes . Remember that girl I told you about ? Yes . Well , she did something very nice . She defended me against her father . That was a very brave and kind thing to do , and ... I don 't know , I ... think I 'm coming down with ... ♪ Feelings ... ♪ for her . Mork , you know emotions are hazardous to your health . Don 't start playing around with that stuff . No , no . Not me . You can trust me , sir . This is Mork , signing off from Boulder , Colorado . Boy , I 'm glad I didn 't land in Buffalo . See you next week , sir .

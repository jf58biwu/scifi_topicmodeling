 Distributed by Toho Co Ltd . There was one girl who smelled like a tree . All the stories you tell are about girls . Lieutenant ! I 'm going to pee my pants . - Again ? - Oooh . How often do you have to pee ? I just feel uneasy . Lieutenant . Lieutenant Iba . What 's the matter ? The position of Venus is different . Last night , it was over there . It 's not possible for a star to move that much in one night . It just can 't happen . Don 't lean against me like that . Nemoto , come here . Mimura , you are so cool . So cool , cool , cool ! Are you guys arguing again ? No . So you 've decided to leave the Self-Defense Force ? Ever since we had the baby , my wife has been urging me to leave as soon as possible . Agata , what time is it ? My watch stopped at 5 : 18 . Lieutenant . - What 's wrong ? - So did my watch . At 5 : 18 . That feels good . Hey , Seki , hey ! My name is Nishizawa , 63rd Infantry Regiment . My name is Seki . I 'm Iba , 55th Infantry Regiment . Are there pirates around here ? Is it just the two of you ? Yes , it 's a bit odd . The Eastern Army 's Q.M.C. were all supposed to meet here . We 're supposed to escort them . Yes , sir . What time is it ? Here . My watch has stopped . What time does it show ? . 5 : 18 . 5 : 18 ? That 's Nishizawa . What 's the matter ? The cell motor is acting up . Someone told me you guys had parts . Okay . When you 're done , go back to your unit . Yano . Put it away . So what are you going to do ? I 've decided to elope with my girlfriend . What ? We are meeting at Imafuri station tomorrow . You aren 't going back with us ? She has a friend in Hokkaido . We 'll visit her friend . Oh , I see . What time is it ? 5 : 18 ? My watch shows the same time . Sengoku jieitai ( G.I. Samurai / Timeslip ) Agata . Agata ! Yes . - Kimura ! - Here . - Shimada ! - Here . - Nishizawa . - Here . Make sure all of your men are here . - Nemoto ! - Yes , sir . - Everyone is here . - Roger . - Agata . - Yes . What the hell happened ? I don 't know . I feel like I was unconscious for a long time . Me too . I remember our watches stopped at this time . Lieutenant , it 's working again . What time is sunrise , Agata ? I don 't know the date today . But when we started maneuvers , it was 5 : 18 . What ? What the hell ? Hey , there used to be a power plant over there . Where did it go ? Where did it go ? - I don 't know . - Where did it go , Lieutenant . - Lieutenant . - Calm down . Everyone , calm down . - I 'm going to pee my pants . - You idiot . This is no time for joking around . The trucks the armored cars and the tank are still here . I 'm sure this is the fifth supply base where we were all supposed to meet . If so , there would be more troops here by now . What 's going on ? Why is it just us ? - Sergeant Kimura . - Yes , sir . - Try the radio . - Yes , sir . Marushito , come in . This is Shitoroku . Maru maru maru maru ... Maru maru maru maru ... This is Shitoroku . Please answer . Nothing . No response . The coastline looks similar , but the environment has totally changed . I thought the ship sank in those waves . What 's going on ? I 'm Sergeant Ono . Second Patrol Boat , Marine Self Defense Forces . I 'm Seaman Kawashima . I 'm Seaman Suga . I 'm Lieutenant lba , 55th Infantry Regiment . What in the world is going on ? We don 't know . We were on our way to the fourth fleet . When we came to , the boat was heading this way . We thought you were swallowed up by the waves . We thought so too . It seemed like big bright waves swallowed us . He has to pee again . Is there a festival going on here ? I 'm Sergeant Shimizu , First Helicopter Unit , Eastern Army . I 'm Airman Onishi . I 'm Iba , Infantry Regiment . Where were you before this ? We were on our way to join operations at our base . But we lost altitude suddenly . It felt like we were swallowed up by the ocean . Yeah . What the heck ? Get down ! We may have travelled through time . Yano ! Yano ! Don 't shoot , Yano . No , don 't ! Stop ! Yano . If you disobey again , I won 't be forgiving . That hurt . This is the first time you 've shot at real people , right ? - How did it feel ? - Next time I will aim at them . Lieutenant . Don 't shoot ! Hold your fire until I give the order to fire . I serve Lord Yukinaga Koizumi of Kasugayama Castle . I am Kagetora Nagao . I serve under Kagetora . I am Magoichi Kuribayashi . I am Takehide Ishiba . I am Yorichika Asaba . I am Katsumasu Tatekawa . I am Yoshiaki Iba of the Ground Self-Defense Force . We are from the same tribe . We 're from the same tribe , huh ? Where did you come from ? We are part of the Ground Self - Defense Force 's Eastern Army . Why did you come here ? Well ... I suppose you could say we drifted here . Drifted ? This iron horse is neighing . You appeared out of nowhere . Nagaharu Kurota is extremely concerned . What was the flying thing in the sky ? Are you talking about the helicopter ? Heli-what ? Heli ? And the things that go bang , bang , bang ... Is that a kind of gun ? That is a machine gun . Machine ? Machi ... Hey , we 're from the same tribe . Machine ... How do I mount this horse ? Can you please let me have a closer look at that ? Okay . Excuse me . What is this called again ? A .50 caliber machine gun . Cali ... Cali ... Would you like to shoot it ? Me ? Hey , Magoichi ! Watch me ! So ... How do I use this Cali ... . ? The Warring States Period ? Magoichi ! I will do anything to have them as our allies . - Monkey . - Yes . Do you have any ideas ? Let 's bring them rice and miso . They said they have food for now . No , no . Kagetora shot the gun that makes the bang bang noises . If we bring them provisions the Kuroda army will definitely consider them a part of our force . You are clever , as always . Lieutenant Iba ! i think we 've travelled through time . Through time ? What do you mean , travelled through time ? We were transported through time to a totally different era . That 's ridiculous . It 's not possible . That kind of thing doesn 't really happen . But it happened . We were accidentally transported through time to this era . At any rate , this Kagetora is strange , isn 't he ? " We are from the same tribe " " Helicopter " Everybody , get down ! Why ? Darn it . Hori ! Don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . Don 't anyone shoot . Lieutenant Iba ! Don 't go in there . If you do that ... Drive . Lieutenant ! Lieutenant . Agata , start the car ! Right now ! I 'm trying . Yes ! - Yano , we did it ! - Forward . Keep moving forward ! - Are you sure ? - Just do it . Kagetora is here ! Our ally ... " We are from the same tribe " I really appreciate your support . Kill him ! I have his head . I have Nagaharu 's head ! I have it ! That was so cool . Kano , do you really think killing people is cool ? We just did the same thing as Lieutenant Iba . Two of our guys died . It was kill or be killed . Some of them even had primitive guns . We don 't belong in this time period . If we get involved in this era , history will change because of us . If it changed , what would happen ? History might not forgive us . Agata , what do you mean by that ? Are you saying we can 't go back to our own time ? Do you mean we 're going to die ? I think we have no knowledge of time beyond dividing the day into 24 hours . Still , nature 's restorative powers are beyond our comprehension . I think the aftershock after an earthquake is caused by nature 's desire to restore the earth to a normal state . So if a similar phenomenon happened here could we go back to our own time ? I don 't know . I do think it 's possible , though . Morishita . The army must be freaking out about your disappearance . What ? You are a Self-Defense Force star . You 're the only one who can keep up with the foreign runners at the international marathon held in the autumn . It 's kind of a relief , actually . I don 't have to run anymore . When I think about it , I 'm relieved . It 's already 1am . I 'm leaving . Where are you going ? Imafuri Station . I 'm supposed to be meeting Kazuko there . Maybe it 's just this area that traveled through time . Kazuko is waiting for me . I can 't just stay here when I know she 's waiting for me . Are you ... Are you going to ... How long do you expect me to wait ? We may not be able to go back to our own time . We may die like Seki and Hori . Listen . You have to ... Takashima ! If there is an aftershock , we can go back . Takashima ! Takashima ! Why ? If he had thrown the torch into the truck , we would all have died . We are comrades . Should I have let you be killed by this fool ? Why didn 't you aim at his legs ? To ensure I got the job done . You 're the one who taught me that . Nishizawa . It 's risky to go alone . I 'm going with you . Let 's go . Where did they go ? Without a word to any of us . Did they manage to get back ? Maybe the two of them got back to our era ? No way . That 's not possible . Only them ? Kikuchi , traversing this mountain on foot will be difficult . Calm down , calm down . Hey , be quiet . Our lord Koizumi requests that you to come to his castle . The iron ship that flies . The iron box that runs on the land . The guns that can kill many people with one shot . He wants to see them for himself . I 'm honored , but I 'm afraid I have to decline his request . Why ? We can 't take sides . If we go to Koizumi 's castle ... It will lead to misunderstandings . So you are refusing our lord 's request ? I must refuse . Go back and tell your master . Your master is an idiot . He is a coward who wants to avoid fighting and still benefit . Tell him that Kagetora said so . Go now . I made up my mind after meeting Iba . A man who hides in his castle and .. ... takes advantage of people doesn 't deserve to be my lord . I don 't want to fight for that kind of man . I can only serve someone who deserves my loyalty . I can be a loyal friend to those I wish to befriend . Battles depend on luck . We may die tomorrow . That 's why I want to live my way . Will you fight with me , Yoshiaki ? Would you like to conquer this country together ? Why me ? I was born to fight . I love fighting . I don 't know anything else . You seem like the same type of person . You are well-suited to life in the Warring States Period , Yoshiaki . I got it from my grandma . You look like my deceased grandson . What ? My father was killed by a Samurai with no master . Mai ! I envy you . Why ? Are women really that great ? You must have been in love sometime . No , never . I 've never been in love . What do you think ? Don 't you agree ? To go back to our own Showa Era we must fight history by conquering this country . History doesn 't record our conquering this nation . That 's why we must conquer this country , and change history . That will create a shockwave and the god of history will send us back to our own time . Lieutenant Iba . History may be frightened of the change , and kill us instead . Do you have a better idea ? Yano . Forget about that incident . I don 't like being betrayed . Were you planning to mutiny ? That wasn 't it ! It wasn 't like that . I trusted you and was foolish enough to follow you . I just can 't believe how stupid I was . Yano , Lieutenant Iba was just following orders . He infiltrated your unit to expose the leader of the mutiny . Iba didn 't mean to betray you . You should thank him for the relatively light punishment . Stop it . Stop it . - I will find you a groom soon . - No need for that ! This is the last cigarette . Run ! Run ! Go ! Go on ! You have a girlfriend who is waiting for you . You have to go ! Kazuko ! What are you guys doing here ? Oh , were you in here ? What are you doing ? Protecting this patrol boat is one of our duties . We knew the waves would be high this evening . By the way , where did you get these weapons ? We 're just following Iba 's order . Lieutenant Iba 's ? What is he planning ? We have no idea what he 's planning . Let 's load it . What is this ? Please don 't hurt me . I 'll do whatever you want . Do you want to die ? No , no . Will you come with us ? Yes . - Bye . - Start the engine . Do it now ! Wake up ! Yano . Kano . I can take over for you now . What the hell is that ? Grease . It stinks . I am so happy to be alive . Look at these rear ends . Hey there , women ! We 're kings ! Shimada , are you asleep ? You 're missing out . Corporal Yano . Lieutenant Iba wants to talk to you . Please answer , Yano . Corporal Yano . Lieutenant Iba wants to talk to you . Please answer . - Corporal Yano . - Just ignore it . Yano ! Yano ! This is Yano. lf you want to talk to me , make it quick . He 's answering . Verify his position . This is Iba . Come back , Yano . If you surrender now , I will reduce your punishment . I 've heard the same line before . Listen , we 're going to attack villages one by one . To get women and food . If you don 't like it , come do something about it . I will say this one last time , Yano . Come back . I 'm not a coward like you . I 'm not a traitor . Why don 't you come fight me if you have a problem with me ? If you 're so eager to fight , I 'll be your opponent . Let the women go . I see them , at 2 o 'clock . They found us . We let them find us . - Do it now . - Okay . Here they come . Get closer to the coast . Let the women go . Go ! I said go now ! Get off the boat right now . Go now ! - Bye . - Swim fast ! Bye now ! Women of the Warring States Period . I 'm leaving . I don 't like internal squabbles . - Shimada ... - I can 't keep up with you guys . - Shimada . - What ? You must take responsibility for how you live your life . Hey , they took the rocket launcher . Three machine guns , one rifle . Grenades too . They 've got balls . Hit the target ! That 's a 60 mm mortar . If they hit us , we 're dead . They can 't possible hit us from the boat . - Mimura . - Yes . Remember the position of the patrol boat . I am going to drop you off on the leeward side of the island . The way the boat is positioned , they won 't be able to see you . To protect this helicopter from the boat ... - I will create a distraction . - A distraction ? Go for it while their attention is focused on me . You 're the 55th Regiment 's best sniper . Mimura . We only have one shot at this . Got it ? Yes , sir . Don 't lose any altitude . Yes , sir . They 're back . What the heck ? They 're trying to protect the helicopter from the rocket launcher . Get a firm grip . This is it for that helicopter . Sun goes down . Sun goes down . The sun is already setting . Sun goes down . Sun goes down . Come sail with me on my boat . Someday I will sleep the eternal sleep by your side . Even a painful journey ends eventually . I will dream about that day . I am distracted by your kindness . I am traveling in the wild . Sun goes down . In the sunset , I can see eternity . I am traveling in the wild . Sun goes down . I am distracted by your kindness . I will live from the heart from now on . I will conquer this country with Kagetora Nagao . I 'm going with you . Good . I can 't fully comprehend what 's happening here . But we 've already lost ten people . If we 're all going to die anyway , I want to fight . I 'm going too . We will have war , Agata ! I 'm betting we 'll be able to get back to our own time . I 'll join you in that bet . I have to pee . Again ? The timing is just so funny . Lieutenant Iba . This tank will be in action for the first time in a long time . I just want to go home as soon as possible ! Hey , if you guys are going , I 'm going too . I 'm going with you guys . Okay . I 'm sorry , but I 'm staying . What ? By yourself ? I promised them to become their big brother . What are you going to do here all by yourself ? What if there 's an aftershock and we all go back to our own time ? You 'll be alone here . Nemoto , please reconsider . Your ancestors may be here . What happens if you get involved with your ancestors ? Agata , let him go . I 'm busy . I 'm so busy . To Kasugayama Castle ! What 's wrong ? Is that your woman ? No . Never mind . She disappeared . Kikuchi ! Kikuchi ! Kikuchi ! Kazuko is waiting for me . Lieutenant . Treat him . Hey Kikuchi ! Lord Iba . I am leaving now . Tomorrow , we will finally enter Kasugayama Castle . I look forward to it . Lord Yukinaga Koizumi . Kagetora . I was told that you called me an idiot . Yes , I did . While Kuroda and I were battling each other you tried to join forces with Irobe . You are a sneaky man . So I am a big fool ? Did you come here to die , Kagetora ? Not at all . I came here to take your life . Have you gone crazy , Kagetora ? Settle down . I am ashamed of myself . The lord I admired was an idiot . From now on , I will be the lord . I , Kagetora , will rule this country . Follow me . I will kill whoever disobeys me . Hey . Hey ! Don 't touch the fire . Hey , you ! Go back to your position . Let 's take this route . This road is good enough for our tank . That road leads to Kawanakajima . Shingen will be there . We will kill Shingen ourselves . You head west and battle the Asai-Asakura . Do you think you can kill Shingen without help ? Shingen is a tough opponent . Let 's meet in Kyoto , Kagetora . We 'll be ready to take over the country when we meet there . Very well . Take care of it . Hey . Bring her along . If you don 't , I will . Do any of you want a woman ? I made some arrangements with the village below . Are there prostitutes ? There 's a widow . You can sneak into her place if you want . Sneak in ? Are we allowed to do that ? Young men are supposed to sneak into a widow 's place . It 's apparently the custom around here . I 'll go . You 're so quick to move in these situations . Sorry . Should I go with you ? Let 's go . I 'm going to do something I couldn 't do in our own Showa Era . That 's right . This era is different from the difficult Showa Era . You can live the way you want . You don 't have to hesitate . - I 'm going ! - Me too ! He doesn 't have to pee at times like this , eh ? I feel kind of guilty about my wife . You idiot ! Why worry about someone who is 500 years in the future ? You are so practical about these things . That seems to be the house . What 's the matter ? Morishita , what are you ... When we 're naked , we 're the same as the people of this era . You 're right . Kazuko . Are you going to sneak into her place ? We 're planning to do the same thing . Let 's decide who 's going first . Do you guys know " rock , paper , scissors " ? Rock , paper , scissors ? Marathon . Marathon ? Third in line . There are a lot of them . Or maybe they just have a lot of flags . Those might be my ancestors . Let 's use the trench mortar . - Morishita . - Yes . - Mimura . - Yes . The azimuth angle from the cardinal point is 52 degrees . Distance : 995 feet . Get ready to attack . Fire ! Go towards the cavalry . Kikuchi , aim carefully . Is it okay for us to harm the enemy ? Kikuchi ! Now ! We have to refuel ! Don 't move the truck . Understood . Morishita . - Move the truck . - Yes , sir ! Abandon the truck ! - Abandon the truck ! - Abandon it ! Go to the APC . Can you hear me ? Fire ! Nonaka , what 's wrong ? They are way too close . Fire ! So that we can go back to our own Showa Era . Muraoka , run . Run ! Hurry ! Muraoka , what are you doing ? This is our chance ! Morishita ! Rifle squad , fire ! Fire ! We 're saved ! We 're out of bullets . Get on the helicopter . Don 't shoot . Go up ! We 're out of bullets ! - Use the radio . - Yes , sir . The radio isn 't working . It 's broken . Morishita . Cover me . Onishi ! Onishi ! There 's a man hanging off the helicopter ! Onishi ! Lower the helicopter ! Lower the helicopter ! Come down here ! Lower the helicopter ! Onishi , Onishi ? We 're going down , Onishi . Onishi ! Onishi ! Onishi . - Hold tight ! - Keep a firm grip ! Don 't whine . Go fight ! Find their headquarters . We 're going to get Shingen 's head . The headquarters , the headquarters ... Kazuko ! Give me a gun ! Any kind ! Right now ! Please go faster ! We 're running out of fuel . You 're just a kid . The Warring States Period ... - A runaway horse ! - Go after it ! Catch it ! Are you Yoshiaki Iba ? Lord Shingen Takeda . Are you the famous Yoshiaki Iba , who is said to be invincible ? Your strategy is truly impressive . Come out ! Don 't come any closer . I don 't need help . I will avenge my father ! I have Shingen 's head ! Good job , Yoshiaki . I look forward to seeing you in Kyoto . Kagetora will be waiting for us at Anegawa , in Omi . We will rule this country ! Kosa , 11th generation Nishi-Honganji Temple Yoshiaki Ashikaga 15th Shogun Fujitaka Hosokawa Shoryuji Castle Master Imperial Palace I know you promised Iba that you would rule the country together . Because of that one promise ... Will you give up the chance to rule by yourself , Kagetora ? The chance to rule ! What is it ? Yoshiaki Iba ... In the battle with Shingen he lost the iron box that flies in the sky and the iron car that runs on land . He barely made it to Myorenji Temple . That run-down temple is the perfect place for them to die . Lord Fujitaka . You don 't need Kagetora 's support . Send your troops to Myorenji Temple and kill Yoshiaki Iba . Yes , sir . Wait , Fujitaka . Please wait , Fujitaka . Kagetora . We don 't know anything about him . We can 't forgive a man who went against the flow of time . Those who side with Yoshiaki lba should not exist in this era . Yoshitaka Kujo Chief Advisor Can we travel through time again ? Can we go back ? Really ? The position of Venus is changing for sure . Is that true ? Lieutenant Iba . Don 't you think we should go back to the fifth supply base ? I think there is a higher probability that there will be a disturbance in the flow of time in that same place . Right . You 're right . Let 's go back there . Agata . Did you come up with this idea because you 're scared ? But Venus is telling us that time travel may be possible . History will only change if we rule this country . That will make it possible for us to go back . It 's impossible for history to change completely . Why ? I 'm sure it will retaliate before that happens . It will try to destroy us . - That 's not going to happen . - But ... We 've lost 15 comrades already . Let 's go back , all of us . I agree with Agata . We will die if we keep doing this . Let 's go back as Agata says . Mimura ... Having a woman has turned you into a coward . We should go back . Lieutenant Iba , we all agree . He 's right . Look at you . Are you giving me an order ? I 'm the one who gives orders . If you can 't obey my orders ... I will kill you right here . You don 't want to go back to the Showa Era , do you ? What ? You want to keep on fighting in this era , don 't you ? You 've felt that way since the beginning . What are you guys going to do when you get back to the Showa Era ? What is there for you to do , in a time of peace ? At a time when we can 't even use our weapons ? Don 't you think it 's better for us to fight in this era ? Don 't you guys want to live from the heart ? We can live from the heart here . I don 't agree with you at all . - I don 't agree with you . - You have no right to talk . A man who hides every time we fight has no right to talk . I admit that I hid . I know I 'm a coward . But what makes dying in battle so cool ? Is it really that cool to be a hero , if you 're dead ? I would rather live with my wife and child as long as I can . I like our era . I love our peaceful era ! I won 't let history destroy me . Let me say this again . You men stay here . Do you understand ? First squad , forward ! Goodbye , gentle and reckless men . I have to say goodbye . In the sunshine of freedom ... I become a man . I get excited ... You aim right here and shoot . Do you understand ? I 'm counting on you . I don 't want to be killed by someone I know nothing about . I want you to kill me . Kagetora . Stay back . This has nothing to do with you . Kagetora . I am the one who will rule the country . Friendly , oh friendly ... How great it would be if we could be friends . Friendly , oh friendly That 's all I want . The sweat on your innocent face shows you have been having fun and sharing in good times . As I unbutton my shirt ... I exude the smell of alcohol . I talk to myself . I want you to remember that living is loving . I will sing lullabies as long as I can . I will sing lullabies as long as I can . Lonely , oh lonely . I will be happy when you see me off . Lonely , oh lonely . Everything after that is up to you . In your heart ... Sadness will be born . When you grow up someday ... You will remember . I drank too much . And I got caught in the rain . And sometimes I passed out drunk . That 's what you 'll remember about me . All you can rely on is yourself . I want you to learn that . I will sing a lullaby for you . I will sing a lullaby for you . I will sing a lullaby for you . I will sing a lullaby for you .

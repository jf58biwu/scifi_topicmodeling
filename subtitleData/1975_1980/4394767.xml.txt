 Walter ! ( GRUNTING ) HUBERT : Walter ! Walter ! ( PANTING ) HUBERT : Stop ! Stop ! Walter , about a mile back . Horse threw him . Got a broken leg . Been out all night . - Walter ? - Yeah . A shepherd man . Friend of mine . Well , are you coming or not ? Of course we 're coming . ( MOANS ) Well , we 're too far from Wellingham and our German friend . ( MUMBLING ) Sloton Spencer ... - What ? - Vet ... - What ? - Vet . - A vet ? - Did my sheep . A vet . Where is the vet ? North or south ? Where is he ? Ma ... Manor . - Manor ? - House . Manor house ? Is that it ? A manor house ? Sloton ... - Sloat ? - Spence ... - Has he gone ? - Who ? Our big , husky commissar . Oh , yes . He prowled round the stables for a bit and then off he went . " We must teach the people ! " You 're probably the only vet in the country . " ( LAUGHS ) # Don 't put your daughter on the stage , Mrs Millon # - Make her a vet . - What 's he going to do anyway ? Round everybody up and force them here to be lectured ? He 's persuasive enough . - Bit intense , I thought . - That 's passion . - That 's what ? - It 'll appeal to the women . ( SCOFFS ) Well , you should know . - Greg ? Hmm . - Hey . You watch it . - Short for Gregory , I suppose . - Hmm . - Hello . - Hello . Is this Sloat Spins ? - Sloton Spencer , yes . - Ah . - Uh , I 'm Charles Vaughan . - Philip Hurst . - Are you ill ? - No . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? I gather you 're a vet ? Well , more human than animal nowadays , I 'm afraid . Oh . Well , we have a man with a broken leg about three miles south . We daren 't move him . Oh . I 'll go and tell Janet . She 's the vet . Oh . PHILIP : All right , Charles ? CHARLES : Yup , all right . No , I didn 't . Collect all this . I 've always lived here . The whole area was my practice before the Death . Pretty lucrative . Lot of horses . Mind you , I 've raided a few colleagues ' surgeries . Not as much danger from dogs in the country . Well , not then , anyway . Are all the drugs you use the same the doctors used ? Oh , yes . Why ? Oh , I was just thinking about a friend we had who went into Birmingham once for antibiotics . We never thought of vets . - What happened to him ? - He died . - Allowed to watch ? - Yes , of course . Come in . Incredible , isn 't it ? This was Janet 's practice before . - Oh , I see . - I was just thinking about Paul . No need to go into cities . Aye . Well , we learn . At a rough guess , I 'd say you 're about as useful as a doctor . - Sorry . I didn 't mean ... - I know . ( CLEARS THROAT ) - You must get about a lot . - Yes , I do . - Do you go far ? - As far as I have to . As far as I can . 'Cause there 's Brucellosis about 60 miles south of here . How many ? Well , we think it 's run its course now . But about 20 cows died . - But a friend of ours went down with it . - How long ? - Sorry ? - Well , how long has he had it ? About a week . - Fever ? - To begin with . - How old is he ? - Well , she 's about ... About my age . She 'll be all right . Behind you , in the cupboard , there 's some wire . That 's it . Can you place it over his face ? ( MOANING ) Now , don 't worry . We 're giving you an anaesthetic . You 'll be fast asleep in no time . Place it each side . Jenny , if you can open that thing over there and get a large pad of cotton wool . Where 's Hubert ? Oh , Philip 's teaching him about horses . He used to be a breeder . That 's right . And good practise for you , too . Now , put the pad over the wire netting , that 's it . Charles , there 's a pair of scissors in that drawer . Cut his trouser leg from the thigh , will you ? - This one ? - Yes , that 's right . But gently . He 's got a fracture of the femur . ( MOANING ) Do you know that a doctor wasn 't allowed to practise on animals , but a vet could on humans ? Good heavens . You see , a vet was trained as an applied scientist . A doctor was constructed not to think of anything else alive except humans . In our situation , vets are infinitely more valuable . We 're used to disinfectants , controlling the environment . We hardly ever referred our patients . Not like doctors . And as far as emergencies go , we can do almost anything , provided ... I should stand back if I were you . Provided we have the anaesthetic . ( WALTER MOANING ) Now , breathe deeply . Come on . Deeply . ( WALTER BREATHING DEEPLY ) Finish the trousers when he 's under . Keep breathing . Keep breathing . - Fluoranthene . - What ? Fluoranthene . Before , we used it in conjunction with oxygen . Oh , I see . Hence , the wire and the cotton wool . No oxygen . We ran out of oxygen ages ago . What happens when you run out of fluoranthene ? Well , I suppose we 'll just have to get used to it . Pain is something we 'd largely got rid of . But we managed before anaesthetics . - Thank you . Not very well . - Oh , come on . In Trafalgar chaps got their legs shot off and they cried out , " Oh ! Got me leg shot off . " Got slugged on rum or whatever it was , old sawbones lopped off the leg , slapped hot tar on the stump , and that was it . Cheers . - ( CHUCKLES ) Cheers . - Cheers . There are substitute anaesthetics . Like a synthesis of pethedine . How on earth did you know about that ? - Oh , we 've met people . - Here . That 's aspirin . From willow bark . And there 's a fellow we met called Bill Sheridan . He 's an expert on homeopathic medicine . See , it 's quite apparent to me that we 've enough skill and inventiveness to really get things moving again . All it needs is organising . A federation of communities ... ( CHUCKLES ) Sorry ? I 'm sorry . It 's a private joke . ( LAUGHING ) Look . What about tonight ? We 've got beds and we can feed you . And hot baths . It 's a back boiler . Are you warm enough ? Yeah , I 'll do . Here , who 's gonna look after your sheep ? You off ? I don 't mind telling you I 'm getting a bit fed up with charging around all over the place . I 'll ask her about your sheep . She 'll get somebody . - Did it hurt ? - Huh ? Did it hurt you ? ( CHUCKLES ) No . No , I went out like a light . It hurts a bit now , though . ( PIANO PLAYING ) Some people can do everything , can 't they ? I mean , even now . Behaving as if they had money , as if they were old barons . You can 't make it out . It 's funny , innit ? Damn funny . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , well . They 've even got bath salts . It 's going to ruin our surviving technique . Oh , it 's just for one night . - They seem nice people . - Hmm ? Yes . Yes . If ... If Greg really thought about me and wanted me ... Look , Jenny . Don 't let all this fool you . These people can 't live like this forever . They depend on other people swapping food for treatment . But what happens if the population falls or they fall ill themselves ? Where 's the support , eh ? Greg knew this . And if it seems he 's been neglecting you then it 's for all our sakes , all right ? Mmm . Poncy smells . Hello , Hubert . This is one of our stills . - For drinking ? - ( LAUGHS ) I 'm afraid not . It 's a substitute for petrol . Every now and then we take the car out when we 've got enough . And we keep the grass down . But it 's a long , slow process . You find you have to go further afield each time for veterinary supplies ? Exactly . You know , you have a fair-sized community living here . People could come to watch and learn . Eventually , they could go out and form their own groups . You could ... You could test them before they went . Examine them . ( SCOFFS ) The National School of Veterinary Medicine ? Well , you probably are the only vets in the country . Yes . Well , in our experience , most people who come here aren 't really interested in what we can do . In the way of development , I mean . I mean , you and your kind are few and far between , you know . They 're going to have to be organised , aren 't they ? Always have bosses . That 's right . In places with democracy , survival comes first . ( CHUCKLES ) You know , it 's quite extraordinary . Only this morning , I was listening to exactly the same words . JANET : That 's the Pony Club I used to help with . We got to Horse of The Year Show in ' 73 . ( CHUCKLES ) Mounted Games . That 's our police dogs we used to look after . Who 's that ? The boy . Well , that was my son . He was away during the Death . So was my husband . He was up in Edinburgh on a business trip . I never saw either of them again . And that must have been taken just before . Well , you can see from the notice there . We had an outbreak of foot-and-mouth . That really saved us , ' cause it meant the people had to stay away . So when I heard the news on the radio , I had plenty of time to disinfect the approaches to the house . " To Mrs Millon . With love , the Pony Club . " Oh , look . I 'm boring you . How about another drink ? Jenny ? What is it ? What was his name , your son ? - Why ? - Your son 's name . - Why ? - Was it John ? We have a boy called John . John Millon . He 's nine now . - We found him . - Where ? Not here . Down south . He was down south . He said he 'd been staying with his granny and ... - She died . - Yeah . I went to look for him . I found my mother but John had gone . He 's fair , round-faced . - He 's got a mole on his back . - Yes ! He 's alive . He 's at a place called Challoner . It 's where we left to come up here . He 's being looked after . There 's a very nice woman there called Pet who looks after him and she 's very warm-hearted and lovely . And ... - Oh , Janet ! - Oh ! ( SNIFFLING ) My son 's there , too . Paul . He 's still only a baby . He went to a prep school , John . ( LAUGHING ) Oh , that 's right . Oh , Janet ! I must go and tell Charles . - Jenny ! - It 's John 's mother ! - Jenny , it 's Greg . - It 's John 's mother . - Greg was here . - Janet . - He was here . - Janet Millon . Our John . And I want Paul . We 're going back . We 're all going back . ( SNIFFLING ) We know how you feel , Jenny . But John isn 't going to leave Challoner . He 'll be there until we get back . Look ... We 've come a long way . We 've suffered quite a lot . If we go back now we 'll have to start all over again . Greg was here , Jenny . He was here . That 's not a rumour or hope . A few hours ago he was here . - Philip said he went north , to Buxton . - North ! Jenny . You can 't go with Janet on your own . The dogs are getting worse . I need Greg as much as you need Paul . As much as Janet needs John ? Jenny , it 's not for me . - No ? - No ! We 're doing it for everybody ? For humanity ? Look . Greg can 't be more than a few miles away . A day or two at the most . We 'll find him . Then we can all go back to Challoner , all of us . - Janet and I can go on our own ... - No ! ... and Philip can look for Greg . Philip has got a man with a broken leg to look after . And I 'm not trusting Hubert with you . Not all that way . We 've got to stick together , Jenny , and be rational . - Rational ! - One day , Jenny . One day . That 's all . - It 's always one day ! - All right , two ! Look . I promise faithfully , if we haven 't found Greg two days from now , we 'll come back here , we 'll collect Janet , and we 'll go back to Challoner . All right ? Now , there 's still some strep left in there , so be careful . - I will . - Oh , hello . We 're just checking through things . Help Philip while I 'm gone . What 's the matter ? I 'm not going . Not yet . Two more days . Well , we can all go then . You see , with Greg so close we must try and find him . We 've come all this way and ... Oh , I couldn 't . I must go in the morning . I must . I just couldn 't . - Only for two days , I promise . - You two go . But what ... - I mean , what if you don 't come back ? - Nothing will happen to us . But I 'd worry . Terribly . I really would . I don 't think I could stand it . Well , we could always leave you a map reference . But the route . Well , you know the safe ways . Can 't your friend Hubert go after Greg ? Hardly , he 's ... He 's not all that motivated . He 's ... He 's not very reliable , either . - Charles ! - Not in this . You see , even if we did know where it was , Philip and I can 't go together . There must always be someone here . We 've got this broken leg now and ... Oh , please . Don 't say I can 't go to my son , please . Why must you find this chap Greg , anyway ? I mean , what so important ? He 's not the Prime Minister yet , is he ? What is he ? An engineer or something ? Well , all right , so he 's got some good ideas . But he 's not going to change the world overnight . And even if he 's your friend , it 's not as important as Janet finding her son . Surely ? He 's the father of my child , my husband . But I though he said the girl was Swedish . What girl ? Well , I don 't know . He talked about some girl . I though he said she was Swedish . - She is Norwegian . - Oh . And there 's nothing between them . Absolutely nothing ! - I wasn 't suggesting there was . - All right , everybody . All right . Why don 't we just ... Why don 't we just go and get some sleep , eh ? Jenny ? - Come on , Jenny . - No . Greg has got a lot to do and he 's very busy . Janet and I shall go to Challoner first thing in the morning . Because we need our children . Don 't we , Janet ? That 's the thing that matters . Don 't worry , Jenny , I 'll keep a lookout for Charles . He 's bound to come back here , with or without Greg . Anyway , we 've got Hubert riding shotgun till tomorrow night . Hubert 's a good shot . Aren 't you , Hubert ? I can manage . Charles has given you the rendezvous . That place by the river . He 's promised to meet up with us tomorrow night . That 's not even two days . It 's not that . It 's just that ... Anyway , Philip , thank you very much for everything . Poor girl . Her baby one end of the Earth , her man ... Goodbye , my love . Don 't say goodbye . I 'll see you soon . Yes . With my son . He might not seem very much like me . Well , it won 't make me love you any the less . - We 'll have a big reunion . - I 've still got those fireworks . They 'll be damp . No , they won 't . I put them in the airing cupboard . - Check the reservoir supply . - I will . And watch Walter 's toes . If they turn the slightest shade ... Don 't worry . - Don 't forget the generator . - Get off . JANET : Bye . PHILIP : Bye . ( GROWLING ) ( BARKING ) Come on . - Hey , how are we doing ? - All right . - What are you doing ? - We 're building a house . - Who for ? - Us . John and me . What 's wrong with the one you got ? We 're playing mothers and fathers . ( LAUGHING ) No luck ? Nah . Dead as a doornail . Is the battery all right ? I checked it with the hydrometer . Seems okay . Seems ages since they left . They 'll be back . ( DOG BARKING ) HUBERT : Down , Jenny ! Stay down . ( BARKING ) ( GUN FIRES ) Of course , it was a rather silly thing to do . - Hey ? What was ? - Oh , to jump up like that , Jenny . Quite right . You could have got yourself killed easy as wink . JANET : Still , it was very brave of you , Hubert . Charles must have confidence to leave us with you . Uh-huh . Well , now , did I tell you about the time before the Death when I was a shepherd ? One of my sheep got stuck on a ledge halfway down the quarry . Stuck fast , she was . I went down there , without a rope . No one to hold me in case I fell . I brought that sheep back up , I did . - But what did you do for handholds ? - Hey ? JENNY : Well , you were carrying the sheep on your back . How on earth did you hold on ? Feet . All the best climbers use their feet , didn 't you know that ? - Quite true . Climbing is all balance . - Ah , there you are . Feet . Anyway , you did save my life . Thank you very much . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) What 's that ? ( WHISPERS ) Charles . ( EXHALES ) I 'm sorry , Jenny . Where 's Hubert ? ( GROANS ) You see , I think we got it all wrong . I kept thinking , as I was chasing Greg . Whitecross was fine for a time . We learned to be independent , to survive . But it 's not in the centre , either geographically or actively . There 's a lot going on in the Midlands and the North . Janet 's place is ideal . Challoner is just a temporary halt . And you 're the kind of doctor that any settlement could do with . Could we form one , Janet , with you at Sloton Spencer ? How many of you are there ? Two adults , two children and a baby . Mmm . That 's all , really , at Challoner , anyway . There 's us two as well , obviously . - I 'll have to ask Philip , of course . - Hmm , of course . - But is it on ? - Oh , yes . Yes ! Why not ? Well , we 'd be able to do more reccies . More searches . And after that we could bring the others down from Whitecross . Yes , I know . I think it 's a good idea . - It 's time I did something positive . - Oh , not you . Oh , yes . I was rather sceptical about your friend Greg . I had no right to be . I was even sceptical about Hubert 's ability to shepherd us . - What matters is sticking together . - Yes . Never mind , Jenny . Not long now before you see Paul . ( SIGHS ) How far to go ? About 50 miles . Can 't be far from Seth 's place at Linden . Can we make the 4 o 'clock call ? Oh , we should get there in time . If we hurry . Hello ? Jack ! Oh , we thought we 'd missed you . We 're at Linden . We 're on our way to Challoner . Yeah . Now listen , this is very important . We have Mrs Millon with us , John 's mother . Yes ! Yes , we found her at John 's home ! She thought he was dead . That 's incredible , Jenny ! Amazing ! ( LAUGHS ) Hey , that 's wonderful ! I can 't wait to tell Pet , let alone John . But you 're certain it 's his mother ? Oh , yes , it definitely is . No doubt at all . Uh , but , Jack , I think you ought to tell him gently . I mean , don 't shock him . No , well , I 'll get Pet to tell him . But it really is wonderful news , Jenny . I can 't believe it ! How 's my baby ? Paul ? He 's fine . Blooming . Now , don 't worry . Hey , how long you been travelling ? Oh , you 'll be worn out . You 've got another two days yet . Oh , we 'll manage . Well , look , if you 're at Linden , why don 't we come to meet you there ? I mean , you must all be bushed . Oh , uh ... Uh , I don 't know . Hold on . I 'll ask Charles . Jack suggests they come out to meet us . We stay where we are . - They come here ? - My horse is a bit winded . Yes , he looks a bit down . Perhaps he ought to rest . I don 't want them to . It 's not a journey for a baby . Not with just Jack and Pet , anyway . Can we compromise ? They come and meet us halfway . Yes , all right . You go and tell him , Jenny . What if we miss them ? We 'll be in a right caper then , won 't we ? They 'll be safe enough if they follow our route . But is it wise ? It 's quite a long way to go with a baby . Oh , Charles seems to think it 'll be all right . And what about dogs ? Well , we 're on the cart . I got my gun . We 'll be all right as long as we don 't carry any meat . Anyway , I 've arranged it all now , haven 't I ? I had to make a decision straightaway . Might not have contacted them again . Yes , all right . ( BOTH GIGGLING ) PET : Look at him . Tomorrow he 'll see his mother for the first time in two years . ( EXHALES ) Um , Lizzie love , come and give us a hand , will you ? - What with ? - It won 't take a minute . But what about John ? Yeah . Well , him too when he 's finished his dinner . Come on . Gosh ! Haven 't you eaten a lot ? Soon we 're not going to be able to feed you . - May I leave ... - In a minute . ... leave the table , please ? John ... Do you remember ... Well , do you ever think about , you know , what life was like before ... You know , before Greg and Jenny and Charlie and I came along ? Do you ? Not much . We 've never talked very much , have we ? About your family ? No . I just wondered . Why ? Well , you know how things happen . People lost touch with each other . You know Charlie 's looking for Greg and he may not find him for ages , for years , even . - He will . - Oh . Well , I hope he shares your confidence . But can you imagine how surprised he 'd be if one day he suddenly bumped into him when he thought that he was ... Dead ? - Yes . - Is he ? Oh , no ! No , no , no , no , no . I was just imagining what it would be like . But suppose somebody told you that somebody that you thought was dead wasn 't dead after all ? Who ? How about your mummy ? I don 't know if she is . But you weren 't with her . You were with your granny when it all happened , everybody dying . She died . Your granny died . Yes , I know . And then you left and Greg and Jenny found you . But suppose you found out that your mummy wasn 't dead ? That she was lucky , like you ? Don 't know . John , lovey , listen . Please . We think that your mummy 's alive . Jenny 's coming back with her . She 's coming here tomorrow . You 'll see your mummy again tomorrow . Is Charles coming ? - Big day . - Yes . - Nervous ? - Yes , we might miss them . - Oh , I didn 't mean that . - I know . Yes , I am . It 's two years . A child grows a lot in two years . - He might hardly remember me . - Oh , I can 't believe that . It 's actually longer than two years . He was at his granny 's for a month before the ... - Well , before it happened . - Oh , he 's very normal . Very well-adjusted , really , considering . It 's remarkable . I 'm quite terrified , actually . He obviously loved you a great deal . He talked about me ? No . That 's the point . He didn 't . ( PAUL CRYING ) Here we go . ( GRUNTS ) There 's a good boy . ( COW MOOS ) Didn 't say goodbye to the cows . - JOHN : Bye , cows ! - Did you try ? - Yeah , I tried . - Well , what did he say ? Nothing . He didn 't seem to care . Well , maybe he doesn 't remember his mother . Well , we 've virtually been his parents . Greg and Jenny , Charlie and me . Yeah , I suppose so . But his mother will be expecting hugs and kisses . No , I don 't think so . I spoke to her on the 8 o 'clock call . She 's a vet and very businesslike . She 's bound to understand . ( WHISTLING ) ( SNORTS ) Here 's Mummy . ( PAUL CRYING ) - Hello , my love . - Hello . Hello , John . It 's me . Your mummy . Where 's Janet ? John 's with Hubert and the horses . ( SIGHS ) A real turn-up . Do you really think we ought to leave Challoner ? - Why ? - John ! - That can 't be it , surely . - He 's only confused . No . He was behaving funny before . - I think something 's happened . - What ? Don 't know . Maybe he thinks , you know , as kids do , that his mother deserted him or something . Well , let 's sort out what we 're gonna do . Who wants to go back to Challoner ? Well , I think we ought to stick together . I 'm not going to leave Paul again , anyway . All right , then , that 's settled . Spend the night at Linden with Seth . He can pass the word back to Challoner . Don 't worry , Jenny . We 'll leave word for Greg there . And Janet 's place is the best place for this fellow . Isn 't it ? Where 's John ? Where 's my pony ? I know I didn 't see him all that much . Well , he was away at school . Even when he was at home , he was off on the farms . Well , he knew all the farmers . And I was busy with the practice . But even so , it 's as though he resents me . Jenny , where 's John now ? Do you know ? Um , I think he 's out exploring with Jack . And you had the foot-and-mouth here just before the Death ? Yes . Uh , I tried to take him round , but he 's sitting in the stable . He won 't shift . Hello , John . They 've taken your pony , have they ? Tell you what , I 've never really seen round the farms . Your mother was telling me about Sam Higgins ' place . Um , friend of yours , remember ? You used to milk his cows . Let 's go and have a look , shall we ? You know what 's happened , don 't you , John ? It 's the foot-and-mouth . Remember ? It probably wiped out all his cattle . Or they had to be killed . You know that , don 't you , John ? Cattle have to be killed when there 's foot-and-mouth ? Your mother probably had to help . But you can 't blame her for that , can you ? I want to go back . I thought he blamed you for his pet cows being killed . He wouldn 't have known . He wasn 't here . Well , shall I take Walter 's meal up or will you ? Janet ? That must be it . I wrote to his granny saying John mustn 't come home because I didn 't want him to see the shooting of the cattle and the burying . Well , he was due home , you see , the day after the foot-and-mouth broke out . Obviously , he thought I didn 't want him back . And his granny probably didn 't tell him about the foot-and-mouth . - She probably didn 't . - Well , his granny died . All he knew was that his mother had forbidden him to come home again . But Philip 's told him about the foot-and-mouth . Oh , he doesn 't understand . And he won 't listen to me . He just stares . I 'll talk to him . ( WATER BUBBLING UNDER BRIDGE ) Ah ! It 's amazing , isn 't it ? Looks just the same as it did when you were here . Remember the old saying the camera never lies ? Aye , well , it did . Quite often . You know , you can be certain of one thing , you get it fixed in your head . And then you 're wrong . ( CHUCKLES ) Do you remember Alistair MacFadden ? - Ah , that man . Yes . - Mmm-hmm . He frightened you . Do you remember why ? Hubert said he was dangerous . Like a tiger . - So what did you do ? - Ran away . - Bet you don 't know what happened then . - Yes , I do . I stayed out all night . In the tree house . Oh , no , no , no . I mean , what happened to Alistair . - He left . - Mmm-hmm . Do you know why ? Because we didn 't trust him . See , we believed that he 'd killed you . And that upset him . And so he left . Hubert went after him on his own like a madman . Of course , we didn 't tell you at the time ' cause you were too young . Telling you now ' cause you 're grown-up . He 's changed , though , hasn 't he , eh ? Hubert ? The guy looked after Jenny . Do you know , Jenny believes that Greg doesn 't want to come back to her ? - No ! - Mmm-hmm . Well , we 'll have to convince her , won 't we ? People believe some funny things . Do you know , your mummy believes that you don 't love her ? And that you think she didn 't want you to come back from your granny 's ? I know why , of course . It 's because there was foot-and-mouth here . She didn 't want to upset you by seeing your favourite cows destroyed . She wrote to your granny , telling her to wait for a couple of weeks , but then the Death came , didn 't it ? She couldn 't telephone or anything . By the time she got down there , it was too late . You 'd already gone . Ah , it 's funny how people believe these things . ( CHARLES WHISTLING ) Wasn 't that incredible ? I actually persuaded him . Oh , I don 't know . My powers , eh ? Look , I don 't suppose I could ... No , no , no , no . You 're too deeply entrenched . What ? Well , I just thought , you know , if I can persuade John to see the facts , then maybe I ... ( INHALES ) You know . What are you talking about ? Well , you know how suspicious you are about Greg . You know , not wanting him and all that . - Poor old Greg . - Oh , shut up ! No , no , no . I know how you feel . No . It 's just that ... When I do find Greg , which I shall do , how do I explain to him that his woman doesn 't want him any more ? I mean , she 's such a suspicious woman , this woman Jenny . - Poor old Greg . - Now look here , I think ... ( BOTH EXCLAIM ) ( LAUGHS ) Oh , dear . Oh , dear . Oh , Jenny , Jenny . ( JENNY CRYING ) Don 't worry , Jenny . We 'll find him . We 'll find him . JOHN : Um , let 's see . What is white , fluffy and hangs in trees ?

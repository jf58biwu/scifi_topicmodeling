Its g ravitational pu I I can become so i m mense that j ust a hatfu I of it can weig h more than several Al phas . But it does n 't stop there . G ravity i ncreases so not rad lation , not heat , not even I ig ht can escape . Its force is i m meas u rable . Even Com puter can not determ i ne it . You d id n 't answer my q uestion . Do you th i n k we can avoid it ? I thoug ht I d id . Pau I as ked if we cou ld avoid the g ravitational force of a black s u n . The answer is no . However , we may be able to use it to ou r advantage . Victor . These eig ht anti - g ravity towers stabi I ise ou r g ravity i n Al pha .

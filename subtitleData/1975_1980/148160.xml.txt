 Not a problem . Hey , Mike . You ready to go ? You look hot in the outfit . You all charged ? Is this thing tuned up ? - Three photographers , $ 250 each . - I thought it was $ 400 each . Kid , are you in or out ? I 'm in . Okay , here to the bridge . Winner take all . If the cops get you , you 're on your own . Hey , right here , man . Beautiful . Hey , kid . Smile . Hey , give me room , will you ? Shit ! You almost got me killed , asshole ! You son of a bitch ! Grab hold ! Oh , shit ! - How the hell are you doing ? - I 'm good . How long have you been back ? Three weeks . Spent it with my kids . I miss them when I 'm over there . Why don 't you bring them back ? You could afford it . Look at these baubles . So , what happened , man ? - Still trying to kill yourself . - Something like that . What happened to playing pro ? I thought you got picked for the minors last fall . Yeah . Well , that didn 't quite work out . You know , coach wanted me to play D. - What did you do ? Hit him ? - I should 've . Wasting your life . I just haven 't gotten the break I need . NHL tryouts are in three months . Jon , the break you need is right here . They 'll give you $ 5,000 just for showing up and if you make the team , pow ! Come on . It 's a circus , not a sport . - Pretty sunset , though . - It 's the mines . - What is ? - Dust from the mines makes the sunset red . Come on . We both know cash is king . I last two more years , I have enough to retire . Support my family for life . They love Americans , especially baby-faced , boy-next-door types like you . It 'll be just like high school . You run , I block . Besides , it 's where even a doofus-ass white boy like you can get laid . - Is that right ? - That 's right . I appreciate the offer , but I should stick around . This is my year to make pro . I tried . Good luck with that . My flight leaves at 9 : 00 p.m. tonight in case you change your mind . Thanks for saving my ass today . Anytime . CENTRAL ASIA FOUR MONTHS LATER - You better walk . - What ? What 's the matter ? It 's Sunday . The mines are out . Oh , shit . kay ! Yhirty seconds to go ! I don 't understand a word you 're saying to me . But maybe if you say it louder , I won 't understand you even better . Hey , I get it . Your nipples get hard at the very sight of me , right ? A new bio on the kid . Now he 's a rodeo champion . Cue the chant . Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan . They 're waiting . Hailing from the wide-open plains of Texas , a former rodeo champion and first-round draft pick by the prestigious National Hockey League considered the next Wayne Gretzky he refused a king 's ransom from the NHL to play here in a real man 's league . - Holy shit . - He 's a sure bet for rookie of the year who kills his stubble each morning with a Wilkinson Sword Tri-flex . Here he is , your very own Jonathan Cross . Please , my friends , sit down . Have a seat . You are his boy . Looks like Alexi has got himself some hot investors . Vodka ! You got your armadillo on ? Jesus , you 're an idiot . Idiot . You want to be a paraplegic ? Do you know what those guys can do to your spine ? Got to catch me first , Rid . - Right . It 's your face . - Yes , Mother . At least do it up . - Okay , Mom . - Stubborn bastard . Toba ! Okay , Toba ! Big roar now ! Let 's hear it ! Let 's go ! Great roar , Toba ! You hang tight up there tonight , okay ? - You too , Jonathan . - All right . Hi , I 'm the new guy . Listen up , thugs . We got our butts kicked last game , but I 'm not going down again . Are you ? - I didn 't hear an answer ! Are you ? - No ! Let 's give them something to think about in case we see them in the playoff . That means teamwork , so no cowboy hot-dog dogshit . Can 't we all just get along ? No , no , Aurora 's right . No more of the " cowboy hot-dog dogshit . " When the Red Horsemen went to the Golden Horde last month they came back with their tails between their legs . Now the Horde comes to Horsemen town . Yhe word is " rematch " and the Horsemen hope it 's spelled " payback . " A team must go around the track twice maintaining possession of the rollerball before they can score . It 's really that simple . As simple as using a Lifestyle female condom before sex . The ball must be held at all times . Player gear may be only used to dislodge the ball orprevent a score . A team gaining possession must first do the rabbit hole . Yhat 's that killer tunnel above each bench . Yhen make one circuit through enemy territory and then they 're eligible to score . All you really have to know is there 's only one way to score and that 's when a player takes one of the balls wings it at one of the goals hard enough to set off the pyro . As for the rest of the rules ... . The rest of the rules are Russian and complicated . What 's it going to be , U-Chow ? Us or them ? Us or them ? Patience , outlander . The gods are not yet ready . We got some big goons over there . Watch your backsides . Yen seconds to the first ball . First-ball wagers close in ten seconds . Five four three ... . It 's us ! It 's us ! Go , go ! Denekin , move ! Ball 's away . It 's rollerball ! Firstplay of the rollerball game is underway . - Yhrough the rabbit hole . - Need a ride , Rid . Yhis one is starting early . On the way . It 's a 12-footjump . And Jonathan Cross is in enemy turf . He crosses back around . Yhis game , I cannot believe it , is starting this early . Yes , yes , yes ! Cross leaps ! Cross is in the air . He scores ! Cross has scored in record time ! Only 12 seconds after the first ball and he soars over the heads of the Horde ! Cross has led a 1-to-0 lead ! She says you must do again . - What ? - Drink again . Label out . Put the label out . We 're the hottest sports entertainment start-up in the world . You have to pay some headliners but the rest get bollocks . Yhey 'll fight forpeanuts . It 's about to get interesting ! Good move for Denekin ! Yhe local boy who made good used to work right here in the coal mines ! Hey , look ! A mine monkey on skates ! All the glitz is put on in the media trailer out back . We even had a computer to build the city around it . You know ? Poof . And it becomes Vegas ! We 've got a fight down there ! Yhere is a fight going on right now ! That 's enough . She just swung at a referee ! Yhat 's a tutu in the penalty box ! What was she thinking ? We got a fox in the box ! A fox in the box ! They put that fox in the box ! She 's called in the catcher . He 's a 400-pound monster on his way in ! I will not allow this game to become corrupted like so many things in this part of the world . The integrity of the game must be maintained . For the people , to keep their heroes alive . And to keep them gambling , of course . Go , go ! Are you crazy ? Are you insane ? - Why are you mixing it up with that guy ? - So he 's doped up . Big deal . It could be PCP for all you know . That dude doesn 't feel anything . Stay the hell away from him . Payback ? How many of you will last the season with management out there watching ... - That woman . - ... this sissy performance ? - Come on ! - Go out and score . Stay focused . We have a lead . We have to keep up the pressure . Tell cowboy to pass the ball once in a while . - They 're keying on him . - She 's right . If she 'd get in the air , somebody would pass her the ball . Enough ! We have a game to play ! - On three . One , two , three ! - Get some ! - She 's wide-open . - Come on ! Throw it . He bogarts it ! Cross keeps the ball ! Yippee-kai-yai-oh ! - Come on , Jon ! - I 'm on it ! Go ! Move ! - You don 't listen , do you , cowboy ? - Here you go , princess . Toba . Toba , get down ! Move ! Toba ! Somebody get a medic ! You 're okay . No , no , no , start the replay later . No . Later ! Later ! Yhere ! Start the replay there ! Guys , wait ! Hold on . Here you go , buddy . Toba , you 're fine ! Hang in there . And don 't screw up . What the hell is wrong with the officials ? I mean , the band can smell it . The audience can feel it coming . Cross is going over the top and if the officials would quitplaying games down there maybe we 'll get this thing going ! " From the mountain , to the prairies " From sea to shining sea " He asks if it 's true your mother is a crack whore . You actually translated that ? My mother 's a pediatrician . Yes , it 's true . The plane leaves at 8 : 00 a.m. Sharp . That 's 8 : 00 a.m. tomorrow morning . Be there , be on it or be history . We will see you in the morning . Hi , I 'm the new guy . My friends , they call me " Rabbit . " Really ? What was that ? I think it 's something about her only batting for the home team . Management told me you got to wear the hat . - Like hell , I will . - No , I 'm serious . Management is going to tell us what to do , Rid ? You got me . You wear the hat ! I told you this was the promised land . First one to the club buys ? - Jonathan ! - Hey , you get off ! - Asshole ! - I 'm going to kick your ass , Rid . You guys are nuts ! - I told you . It 's the promised land . - Yes , sir . Hey , listen , please take extra-special care of this car , okay ? Thank you . - Ready for Ridley 's great adventure ? - Yeah , let 's go play ball . Gentlemen , gentlemen . That 's great . I love this country . Oh , my God . Honeys at 4 : 00 . Yes , ladies , Sir Ridley 's in the house . - American horses , right ? - Absolutely . And hung like one . We don 't speak much . That 's the way I dig it , yo . You don 't speak much . " The way I dig it , yo " ? You ever try to get laid with an accounting degree ? Hey , Jonathan ! Hey , Katya , how are you ? - My number . I got my number on . - She 's official . She 's got her number . Congratulations . It looks beautiful ! Don 't like the idea of a number tattooed on your face ? You guessed it . Now we will all get big bonuses , thanks to you . To Jonathan and to Ridley . Thank you very much . No . This toast should be to Toba . To Toba . Hey , come here . Come here . Take it . Go . Why do you show me disrespect ? You work 24 hours in the mines and it pays nothing . I brought you here and you try to pay ? All right , my gypsy brother . Have a drink . A little wound tonight , Denny ? What happened could have happened to any of us . It 's very bad shit , man . It 's a rough game . That 's why we get paid . You make a hundred times what I do . What 's up , Denny ? What if it wasn 't an accident ? What are you talking about ? U-Chow . Show him . - The chin strap has been cut . - Where did you get this ? I found it in the trainers 's office . Look at this . Slow down . She says the gambling syndicates probably put them up to it . You need to tell Petrovich . No , we 'll deal with this on the track . Toba was almost killed , Rid . He 's the owner . I wouldn 't bother him with it . Fine , Captain . I 'll go . Enjoy the party . No move . Me be back soon . Tonight was the best game . Real cowboy shit . Tonight was the best game . Real cowboy shit . - Is he available ? - Of course , for you . Mickey . Gentlemen , please . My stallion . Hey , Ridley , my homie . Let me introduce my friends . This is Joe Bartley from U.S. Network . Enzo Molinari , Canale Cinque . Hello . Pleasure to meet you . And Yuri Kotlev , owner of the Horde . Careful , Jonathan . I think he 's angry with you . Dirt Cannon , an investor from Montana or one of those places , you know . How do you do , son ? Nice to meet you . Big money , big money . Listen , can I talk to you for a minute ? Yes , of course . Please , this way . What can I do for you ? I think the chin strap has been cut . - Where did you get this ? - It doesn 't matter . No , you 're right . It doesn 't matter . If that fat swine was behind this , I will get the owners to take his team . - May I keep this ? - What will you do ? I 'll take care of it . I swear on my mother 's grave . A nice boy , yes ? Jonathan ? He 's the angriest man in the game . He just doesn 't know it yet . Borges , you still back there ? Discreetly . And how is Mr. Jonathan tonight ? You play good ? How come it always feels like we got the freeways to ourselves ? We are not a rich country , sir . No shit . So why has everybody bet their ass on the rollerball ? We call it the Atlantic City syndrome . Watch what you 're saying . My apology , Jonathan . Our problem . Not your problem . That 's no worry , Borges . You guys be good tonight . Don 't wait up . You think we could do this in a bed sometime ? - You know , with sheets and stuff ? - We 've been through this . This should be our secret . How could I forget ? " It could be used against us . " Against me . You 're untouchable . Come on , Aurora . You don 't need to hide all the time . I don 't . Yes , you do . You live in the dark for Christ 's sake . Your face isn 't nearly as bad as you think . I know that . Yeah , that 's why you always turn your left side to people . I don 't always turn . Toba 's helmet was cut . I took it to Petrovich . And you think that does some good ? He seemed pretty upset . I think he 'll take it to the Horde owner . You are so naïve . - Jonathan , they knew . - They knew what ? One of the TV guys put me on to this . I think I can call it up . Here , look . That 's Toba getting hit . It 's caught clearly on five cameras . So they were following the action . Let me back the feeds up five seconds . Okay , now look . One camera follows the action four cameras follow a simple-minded boy at the other end of the track . They were called and told to get on him 15 seconds before it happened . The Horde did not make that happen , Jonathan . Not on their own . This TV guy , you know where to find him ? - What 's going on ? - Demonstration . This is the headquarters for the mines . Hang on . What do you want me to do ? Get out of the car ! - Get out ! - What 's going on ? - Trust me . Get out ! Hurry ! - Aurora , what 's the- - Quick , Jonathan ! Come over here ! Hurry ! Jonathan , get in here ! - Get in here ! - What is going on ? That 's my goddamn car ! That 's not your car . It belongs to Petrovich . - He 'll have another one for you tomorrow . - Goddamn it . This is unbelievable . Don 't you know they can track you with these things ? Come on . What 's with this place ? The state housing authority sold off the apartments ... - ... when they went out of business . - So what ? They never sold off the hallways . Now there 's no one to take care of them . No shit . Sergei ? Stop ! Don 't kill him . This isn 't your friend Sergei , is it ? No , Sergei 's gone . Of course he is . We can 't call the police about it either , right ? Let 's get out of here . He may be the police . You almost missed the flight . Jonathan , good morning . It 's a beautiful day . It was a long night . It was , yeah . Partied , the usual thing with the team . We found your car . Are you all right ? - Yeah , I just had a little accident . - I 'm sorry to hear that . Hey , Serokin , did you follow me last night ? Just found your car . That 's all . Wouldn 't want you to be without . So there was a goon in the apartment , and he bugged out . Might have been a thousand reasons why . He might have been lying to Aurora . Let 's say they are screwing with the game . Then ? Yeah , then what ? Then nothing . Status quo . We play , we win . If it gets too sick , we walk . Come on , guys . I 've got meetings . Why can 't I just take a cab to the hotel ? When the circus came to town , did they let the elephants take a cab ? You 're the elephant . Get in the car , son . It 's an honour and a pleasure to be broadcasting to you this evening with a crowd pushing 50,000 in this beautiful desert city , on the shores of the blue , blue ... . Jeez , this outfit has a lot of money . What is that ? I 'd say it 's a good time in a can . Come on in here and get your ass kicked . Come on ! I love you . What channel did you say you gave us in your territory ? - 109 . - 109 . I see . 1-freaking-09 . They do origami on channel six of your silly , hairball network ! You ungrateful cretin ! I will kill you myself ! I will disappear your whole family ! Tell your people , you want to do business with us we are on channels one through five ! Got it ? You got that ? Goddamn mouse . Goal , yes , goal . Goal , yes , goal . The Red Horsemen are rolling right over the home ... . No ! Stop it ! What , are you from Omaha or something ? It was a matter of time before they realized their take would go up if they got blood on the track . You think they struggle with the morality of it ? - Eventually , they 'll kill someone . - That 's what I 'm talking about . I make more in a season than I would 10 years doing taxes . Nothing will happen to us . They need us . So just close your eyes and take the money , okay ? Sergei , the TV guy they found him at the border , his throat cut and his mouth sewn shut . Hey , what 's up ? You don 't look so good . What 's going on ? Well , you hit the prod ramp and jump , and then I cross under and go . Then you shot , and then you do the four-forty so I wasn 't sure , but I think you scored the touchdown . Got it ? Absolutely . I scored a touchdown and I won . Got you . Got you . We 'll beat them ! Yhis Mongol Blue Yeam is on fire and insane ! Yhey 're lathered up like a Siberian wolfpack ready to tear the Red limb from limb . You 're not wearing your spine protector , right ? That 's right . Over a quarter left to play , it 's the Horsemen ... . I see . We should make some arrangements . I don 't want problems ! I want solutions . It 's in the works . We got ourselves a motorcycle race here ! Aurorajust got hammered ! That son of a bitch has got to be eight feet tall . Here 's your bike , little lady . Hope I didn 't bend it . - Do I wish you spoke English . - I speak it just fine , asshole . Bail out ! All right , easy , fellas . Come on , get him out . We 're out of here . Ridley , my man . - How are you ? - I feel like Freddy Krueger . - How is he , doctor ? - Hey , I 'm good . I 'm good . - He should be resting . - I feel fine . I can play . - You sure about that ? - I feel fine . - Are you up to it ? - It was , after all , just an accident . You don 't know how glad I am to hear you say that . All right , that 's it . Let 's go . Out ! You promised me you 'd stop this . Dear God , your tone . How have I denied you ? I have made you into a rich man , an international star . I created a sport you could thrive in . I gave you total freedom to do as you please and even satellite TV . And ask for one thing : Your trust . So will both my studs be at practice tomorrow ? - Yes , sir . - Excellent . Horsemen , number one . Watch them . They take a shit , I want to know what it smelt like . Let 's go . Wait . Don 't move . Close the doors . It 's cold as hell . The door . Hey , the door ! Come on , Denny . What about our passports ? Katya tried . She couldn 't get them . She 's afraid they have something on her . - We have to wing it . - You get the cash from my place ? Your apartment was being watched all the time . The players put this together . Thanks , Den . Thank them . I don 't know what to say . Okay , look . The nearest border is Russia . You have two crossings at the Russian border . One is by the river . Leave now , you can make it by morning . - I thought you two were coming with us- - - No , he has family here . I have my mother . If you don 't want them to disappear or have an accident ... . You can never really leave . - Aurora , wait a minute ! - No . - Are you going to be okay ? - Stop . Before you say something even more stupid . Get the light , over there on the wall . There 's no way I 'm going to die in this shithole of a country . No way . We left the rest of the team , Rid . How many times do you have to get your head handed to you before you stop picking fights with people who are too big ? This isn 't a college coach you can flick off ! These are dangerous people . Look , Jon . She 's safe . She 's safe . Nobody knew about you two . Shit . We have company . Looks like they brought the Russian cavalry . Great . We 're being chased by our own bodyguards . Here they come ! They 're on your bumper ! The fender . Squeeze them ! Oh , shit ! Come on , you son of a bitch ! - That ain 't going to work twice . - They 're still coming on us . - Remember Squeak Harris ? - Of course I remember Squeak Harris . Remember how he died ? Change with me . Oh , shit . Let 's rock - ' n ' - roll ! One , two , three ! Goddamn it ! This road isn 't even paved ! I haven 't seen lights in about an hour . Why don 't we back off a little ? How fast are we going , anyway ? I don 't know . It 's in klicks . Well , how fast is it in klicks , then ? - One-ten , one-twenty . - That 's not so bad . Ridley , that 's in miles per hour ! - So what . - So what ? You 're going 120 miles per hour on a hog on a dirt road ! It 's not an off-road bike , Rid ! It 's 10 klicks to the border . Chill . That 10 klicks is going to be a long walk if one of these tyres goes out . Oh , shit . Ridley , we 've got lights ! Don 't look ! Watch the road ! - It looks like they 're gaining on us . - What ? They 're definitely gaining on us , and fast ! What the hell could they be driving ? Look , my limit 's 150 , man . Faster ! What in the world are they driving ? Shit ! Come on , baby ! Who said this isn 't an off-road bike ? I got news for you , Rid ! They 've got an off-road airplane ! There it is . That 's it ? That 's the border ? What do you want ? A Stuckies and a casino ? We can make it . It won 't work . Not double . Then you go . Don 't get saintly on me , Ridley . Look , I got you into this ! Your kids . Go home . - Ridley , I 'll be fine . I promise . - No ! Get to the American consulate . They 'll have me on a plane first thing in the morning . Go ! Get out of here ! Go ! You better make it . Serokin . " Close your eyes and take the money . " God forgive me . Wait . Let 's see if he makes it . Come on . Magnificent . Let 's go . Make sure you tip the border guards well . Did you really think I could let you pull a stunt like that ? Even if I wanted to ? ln front of them ? How could you do that to me ? How could you be so thoughtless ? All right . We start again . I 'll give you a bonus of $ 100,000 , U.S. , payable , however you play through the championship . Play till the goddamn cable deal closes then you may go where you wish ! I 'll even give you a retirement game ! Go fuck yourself . Throw that sack of shit out of here ! Get rid of him ! Get rid of him ! Oh , Jonathan . What are we going to do with you ? In the old regime Petrovich was above the official rank in Spetnaz before the age of 30 . KGB colonels used to cross the street when they saw him come . Now they line up to grovel in the dust . Would you like a drink of water ? No . You obviously don 't care anything for yourself , but think of the girl . You don 't imagine you have any secrets , do you ? Why do you think she 's still alive ? Because Petrovich needs you . He 'll give you anything , including the life of that lady if you play your cards right . You have an opportunity here . You might call it the opportunity of a lifetime . You see Yevgeny over there , so full of himself now . He used to work in the post office . I introduced him to the proper financing , and now he owns the mines . Yeah , making a fortune . Keeps the miners in line . Good business . Good business . You might wonder why I 'm not in it myself . I don 't need to own the mines , Jonathan . Do you know why ? 'Cause I own the man who owns the mines . All he has , I have . Same with the supermarkets and TV station , locomotive plant . I don 't need a political position because I own the men who do . We learn to separate ourselves from humanity . Like you , Jonathan , separate yourself from your teammates . You can keep your $ 100,000 . But I do like the view from up here . No , I want more . I want ownership . Part of the media rights , gambling revenues , the works . Jonathan , are you fooling with me ? Alexi , we both want the same thing here , don 't we ? Good . Very good . Let Serokin take you back home . You 've got a big night ahead of you . What ? Aurora 's kind of bugging me . You know , getting way too serious . I hate that , too . Women . I want her out of my life . Do me a favour and trade her . No problem . People disappear all the time . No , trade her , Alexi . Just trade her . I like the lady . I don 't want her disappeared . Just gone . All right . I 'll do that . Play well tonight . Play well . Gave me a lot of shit about wanting to become a partner . Just cover to get the girl out . Did you give him that ? I thought it was too subtle for him . So the first chance he gets , he 'll bolt . Shit ! I 'm this close to a North American cable deal ! Well , maybe there is one thing we can do to turn this to a profit . You did promise him a retirement game , after all . Sanjay , you are a rat . But you are my rat , and I love you . Go ahead . Trade the girl . Trade the girl to the Horde . But we 're playing them tonight . He wants her gone . Life is full of little disappointments . Make sure they get a number on her . We heard you were in a rock-climbing accident ! Are you all right ? Yeah , you know me . I 'm hard to hurt . Where is Ridley ? You guys are always together ! Be careful . Ladies and gentlemen , this is whatit 's all about . One hard-fought struggle for all the marbles . And the Red Horsemen- - Yhere is unbelievable tension in this arena . Yhere are four teams in the quarterfinals , but without Marcus Ridley who was crippled by an attack of malaria which he contracted on an archaeological dig . Malaria ? If they 'll buy it , I 'll sell it . - Rid 's not sick , is he ? - Don 't get in this , Denny . Stay out of it . - You shouldn 't go out there , man . - I 've got to . That 's how I got him to send Aurora away . He made it real clear . - Where are they sending her ? - What do I care ? As long as it 's away from here . - What makes you think you can trust him ? - I don 't have a choice . You can 't help me , Denny . Yhe Golden Horde , however seem to have several transfers from other teams ... . Hey . See they got a number on you . Nice . Very nice . Get the goddamn camera out of my face , ass-wipe ! And now , for all of you out there , a surprise is on the way . Despite reports of a rock-climbing accident , he 's coming back . Despite the pleading of his trainers and his doctors , he 's coming back . He 's coming back for the love of the game . He 's coming back foryou and for me . Yhe greatest rollerballer who has everlived your very own Jonathan ... . Cross ! Look . Bravo ! Yes , yes . Bravo . What 's this ? Last minute rule changes . You understand that ? They give this message to you . " Play well and she will be on the Horde Team playing tonight . " A special announcement : " As you all know , at the last owners ' meeting ... " ... certain rule changes were proposed and adopted . " In the final elimination round , normal rules and penalties are to be ... " ... suspended . " What are they doing ? " Yhe game will be played with no fouls called and no penalties . " What is this shit ? There 's no such rule- - Yhey 're going to kill someone . No penalties . This is going to be interesting . He tattooed her face . - What are you going to do ? - Play the goddamn game , I guess . You ever see thugs like that on the bench before ? This will make us , my friend . This will make us . You have the pictures and résumés on the replacements ? What we 've got here is Jonathan and Uglich in a no-holds-barred cockfight . Say hello to Mr. Denekin ! Cross snags it . No bogarting this time . He passes it to Katya who scores ! Boy , this crowd sure appreciates Denekin , the local boy who made good . He has a lot of friends in the audience , including his entire shift from the mine . Gold seems to have an extra player on the track . Have we gotsome kind of grudge match here ! Aurora seems determined to wipe out Jonathan Cross . Stay down . Get out of this . - They 're going to kill you ! - Aurora , get off the track . Go on , girl . Holy shit , he 's wearing a spine protector . He knew . He knew . Here 's your grudge match ! Uglich and company singling out Jonathan Cross and trying to put him in the ground . Shit . Cross turns it around ! Yakes out Robot ! Look out ! Uglich is dead meat ! You see ? The show is just getting started . That 's about the hardest hit I 've ever seen ! I got the Asian flu . Come on , baby . What the hell are they doing ? Yeah ! This may be getting out of hand . Maybe we should call the whole thing off . No . Yhe Red coach is calling a time-out trying to get herplayers out of the game . Come in ! We want you to come in . She should go kill herself . No . She 's right . Get off the track . Is anybody going to stop this ? - We should cut the feed . - No . Leave it . Get off the track , Katya . Denekin , get out of this . Dumb cowboy . You don 't have to do this . Yhe man wants a show , Rid . I guess we 'll have to give him one . Punk ! Get back out there ! Cut the satellite feed . I said , " Cut it ! " No more of this ! Enough ! Don 'tyou see ! Yhey 're killing him for the ratings ! Yhat 's noting the script ! Hey ! Sit down ! Open your eyes , fool . The world 's about to blow up . Didn 'tyou hear me ? Sit down . Screw you . You don 't control us anymore . Jonathan . Listen to them . I 'd better go sort this out . Do it . Do it ! Holy shit ! Bravo . Jolly good show and all that . I wonder what he was looking for . These , probably . Well , young Jonathan you 've done marvellously well . One basic rule in this sort of thing is that you must never kill a tyrant unless you 've made an arrangement with his successor . You do see what I mean , don 't you ? Yeah . It means I 'm not done yet . This game may be over . Hey , it 's me . It 's me . You may have started yourself a revolution . Get some of these shotgun pellets removed . - No , he missed me . - Not entirely , he didn 't . What are they doing ? You stood up to one of the monsters that run their lives . And they saw you do it . - Where are we headed ? - To a doctor , to start with . And then if you 're able I thought I might take you home to my bed .

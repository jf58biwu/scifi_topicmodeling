 - How is Paul , Commander ? - He 's not too bad . Couple of fractured ribs , a broken ankle . Dr Russell says he 'll be out for a few days , but he 'll be OK . Nothing serious . Winters ... Do you think you could fill that chair for a while ? Yes , sir . Separates the men from the boys . I won 't let you down , sir . All right . Any problems , check with Carter . I 'll be in my quarters . Good night , Commander . - Good night . - Morning , Commander . Tell me you 've seen something like that before . Nope . Nor has Computer . 'Main Mission calling Commander Koenig . ' Main Mission calling Commander Koenig . Winters , this had better be more than urgent . 'I think it is , sir . ' Magnification . By all that 's scientific , if that 's a spacecraft it defies every known law of aerospace propulsion . Like the bumblebee which shouldn 't fly ... ' .. but does . ' Kano , let 's see what Computer says . Computer , I want detailed information about the space object . Anything ! 'I have nothing to say on that subject . ' Nothing , Commander . I can 't explain it . 'My information is privileged . ' 'Good day , friends . 'I wouldn 't intrude , but I rather need your immediate help . ' - We 've lost visual . - He 's not using radio waves . - Computer 's scrambled . - I 'm trying all channels . 'Not to worry . Our communication is excellent . 'In a moment , even with your restricted sight , you will see me . ' Friendly ? Better ask louder . Suppose you get the wrong answer ? Kano , ask Computer if that thing is armed . 'I am otherwise occupied . ' 'Do grant permission to land , Commander . ' For what reason ? 'I need your help . Isn 't that reason enough ? ' Possibly . We 're peaceful . I wonder what kind of people . That thing 's hostile . And asks for help ? It 's clever . Show some compassion , Alan . Survival first , brotherhood after . 'Excuse me . 'I don 't wish to hurry your democratic discussion , 'but I have an emergency . ' And we have our emergency . 'But mine is greater than your fear . ' Yes , permission to land . 'I am obliged . ' Away from our base . 'Of course . 'One should be careful with strangers . ' Hold it . I gave permission to land , not to approach . 'Can 't you see , Commander ? My intentions are pacific . ' With respect , no . 'I only require your assistance . ' Alan , send out two Eagles , fully armed . They 'll fire only on my instructions . 'I shouldn 't do that , if I were you . ' Why ? 'Because I won 't let you . ' Alan , do as I say . Commander , I 'm not getting through . 'Your intercommunications will function when I want them to . 'Now , Commander . Shall we be reasonable ? ' If you come in peace . 'If ? My word is my bond . ' Then I 'm prepared to receive a small delegation . Unarmed , of course . 'No , I shall welcome a small but influential delegation ... 'consisting of Dr Helena Russell , Professor Victor Bergman 'and yourself , Commander John Koenig . 'Armed , of course . ' - Are we going ? - Do we have a choice ? 'I 'm delighted , Commander . ' 'Greetings , Alphans . 'You will now be delivered to my control room . ' No contact , nothing . - No visual . - No Computer , again . - I 'll take the Eagles up . - But the threat ... I 'm carrying out his original orders . 'Welcome aboard , Alpha party . 'Just let yourselves go . 'It 's quite safe to come out now . 'Do come in that we may be well met . ' Said the spider to the fly . 'Children 's stories are brutal . 'But you have nothing to fear . ' Except fear itself . 'Yes , the wise man knows when to be afraid . ' You are very kind , but I have yet to need assistance . I regret not welcoming you on your arrival . I rest only when I must . Now , how can I help you ? It 's more a question of how we can help you . You summoned us . Summoned ? For help . I 'm Dr Helena Russell . This is Commander John Koenig . Professor Victor Bergman . I am Companion . If you could send for the others , they could explain . I know why you are here , Commander . You think I don 't know what you 're doing why you 're silent , Gwent ? Are you ashamed of your actions , Gwent ? Then I 'll speak for you . Devious . He leaves me to deal with his lesser matters . Um , where is Gwent ? His purpose in coming here is clearly twofold . I 'm well aware of the first and can surmise the second , so I shall speak only what I know . Thank you , sir . From time to time , we must interrupt our endless journey to obtain certain items necessary to our continued wellbeing . Ah ! Now you take an interest . When you want something . I suppose he has issued a long list of his requirements . Some list , Victor . Uh ... Well , we may have most of the basics . 'I have consulted your computer . 'You have everything I need . ' As I said , devious . Why make me explain and then interfere ? 'You were handling things so badly I had to intervene . ' Badly ? Then I withdraw . You can tell him whatever you want . 'You presume too much on our relationship , Companion . ' I 'm glad to hear I can . 'Well , now , Commander Koenig . 'Can I count on your cooperation ? ' We 'll do our best , if , in fact , we can spare all that . 'I already told you . ' Thanks . I want to hear it from our computer . 'Oh , then do so . 'By all means , let us go through channels . ' You 're wasting your time , you know . He controls your computer . It will say whatever he wants it to say . 'You may speak to your computer and speak to your staff . 'Ask your questions . 'Go on . 'Do you dispute my word of honour ? ' Faith , hope and ... 'Gwent 's orders have been relayed to Supply Department , 'and await shipment on Dock 4 . ' - Kano , can you hear me ? - ' Yes . ' When was this order given ? '7 : 11 hours . ' '23 minutes ago , Commander . ' You presume too much , Gwent . 'You are a Commander . ' I demand to see you , Gwent ! 'You do ? ' Everything ... is ... Gwent . Gwent ... This machinery ? 'Machine ? 'Call me a machine ? ' Well , if you 're not a machine , show yourself . You control this machine . He 's not entirely self-sufficient . Almost . But you do have ultimate control ? Over Gwent ? No , no . Would that I could some of the time . 'Control me ? Control me ? ! ' I really would do as he says . Surely you must control this apparatus . Oh , please ! Please don 't anger him . Please , call him Gwent . Now , don 't speak . I can help you . 'Companion ... 'If you 're not dead , then speak . ' All you care about . He 's extremely sick . No , no ... I 'm fit . These little attacks come and go , mere discomfort . 'Are you certain , dear friend ? ' Not to worry about my capabilities . Send for your supplies so we can be on our way . Act quickly , if you please . All right . I 'll order it the moment we 're back on Alpha . 'No . 'From here ! ' This time you have MY word . 'I believe only in my honour . 'Issue that order . ' Please . Accommodate him . He always has his way . 'Always . ' You will get your supplies when we are back on Alpha . No , Commander . No . None of us here , not you , not I , can stand up to him . Haven 't you any influence ? Gwent is my master . I 've always been his companion . I 've grown old in his service . Companions die , but Gwent goes on . Forever . Nothing can stop him . Forget your insufferable pride . Give him what he wants and then go ... while you still can . Gwent , your companion is dying . I do not have the medical equipment here . If he comes back to Alpha ... 'Enough ! Do what I say . ' No . 'I can blast your base from the universe . ' Winters ! Immediate launch . Attack to disable . 'We 're ready and waiting . ' On our way . 'Measure for measure . ' Stand by , rescue unit . 'Truce ? ' Cease fire . You must let us go . He needs medical attention . - ' What 's wrong ? ' - He 's dying . 'Companion must not die . ' Words won 't save him . Don 't pretend you didn 't know I was dying . I said there were two reasons we came here . I am the second one . You knew he was dying ? You don 't understand . Tell them you didn 't want to admit I was dying . That my death is part of your life . You won 't even admit it now , will you ? 'No , you 're not dying . 'You 're only feigning , trying to annoy me . 'Admit it , you old fool . ' I admit nothing , old friend . I 'm sorry to leave behind the worst part of me . Gwent ? Yes . Gwent ... is me . But he outgrew me . Think of me at my best . I leave you to his dreadful ... mercy . 'Companion . 'Companion . 'Companion ! ' He 's dead . 'Blind savages ! You 've killed him ! ' 'Now you will prepare him for burial . ' Look , it is lifting off . - ' Carter . ' - ' Stations . ' Both Eagles have superficial damage , but they 're operational . I have the machine in sight . 'Pursue it and stand by to attack . ' Companion ... is ready . 'I must need speak in passion . 'But he hears me not . 'Here lies Companion , 'my first friend , 'who served me without complaint or self-pity . 'The best of his kind . 'Gone now . 'I cherish his memory . 'His memory remains ... 'Remains ... 'Remains ... 'Someone ... We commit to eternal space the body of Companion . 'Is that all ? ' Amen . 'Amen . 'Amen . 'Companion ! 'Goodbye , old friend . ' What is that ? 'Sensors indicate a body . ' Alive ? 'Dead . ' Execution of a hostage . - I 'm moving in . - ' No . They 'll all be killed . 'Eagles 1 and 2 return to base now . ' Get those supplies on Dock 4 into an Eagle ready to lift off on my order . It is coming back . Destruction of Alpha imminent . - Is Eagle 4 loaded ? - ' Ready in two minutes , sir . ' 'There is no one to restrain me now . 'Commander , give your men the order . ' Winters , can you hear me ? Yes , sir . 'We 're alive . ' - All of you ? - ' Yes . Get those supplies ready . ' They are ready , sir . What assurance do I have , Gwent , that you will release us once the supplies are delivered ? 'Assurance ? Me ? ' Your famous word of honour ? 'If that will do . ' It won 't ! 'You know , Commander , 'Your hostility tires me . 'Companion 's love was a source of joy . 'Must I waste valuable energy punishing you ? ' Waste energy ? Gwent . What about those assurances ? 'No further discussion . 'When I return , those supplies will be on hand , 'if you care to distinguish between life and death . ' Return ? From where ? Somewhere , everywhere ... There 's no sense in whispering . Gwent ! Gwent ! Gwent ! He needs to conserve energy . Obviously he 's low on vital supplies . The lights . Needs . He has needs . And Gwent has never lived alone . It 's not just the supplies . With Companion dead , he must have a replacement . Gwent ! Gwent ! Curiouser and curiouser . Helena ! It 's his heart . 'What is your emergency ? ' Heart seizure . Will you help us ? 'Which of you ? - ' Which of you ? ' - Are you blind ? ! 'Separate . 'Separate . 'He has an artificial heart . 'He 's in a force field . ' The heart 's drained of power . 'Move him . 'Hurry . ' Get him back to Alpha . 'Stand back ! '3,000 volts of electrical energy for five seconds . 'Done . ' Victor ! Are you all right ? Alive and well . And very much obliged . 'Indeed , you are . 'Like my Companion . 'I miss him . 'We understood each other despite petty differences . 'He was such marvellous company . ' Ah , and you were actually friends ? 'Companion and I were fellow travellers . 'Forever . 'So we thought . ' Ah , well . Everything changes . 'I don 't . 'Companion always relied on me . ' And you always relied on Companion . 'Mmm . ' 'Commander ... 'Order your men to deliver my supplies . 'Now . ' Gwent ... I 've given you a lot of thought . 'So you should . ' You 're not getting those supplies . It 's you or us . Attack ! 'You think it better to negotiate from strength , 'Puny as it is ? ' Not negotiating , Gwent . 'Are you counting the costs ? ' To both of us , Gwent . 'Still counting , Commander ? ' We 're willing to risk our lives to stop you . 'So be it . ' 'Commander ! Help ! ' All right , Gwent . Whatever you say . Whatever words appeal to you ! ' " Surrender " is sufficient . ' Cease fire . Recall all Eagles . Cease fire . 'So much better , dear friends . 'And I commend your courage , 'though it was , as you see , ill-advised . 'These are my terms . 'Professor Bergman , because of your age and defective condition , 'you 'll return to your base in exchange for my supplies . 'Commander Koenig , Dr Russell , 'you 'll stay with me as my companions 'for as long as you both shall live . 'Now get those supplies ! ' Prepare to lift off supplies . 'Yes , sir . ' 'Professor Bergman , 'you 'll be delighted to know your transport has arrived . ' Gwent ... Please ... Let them go . 'No . 'You weary me , Professor . ' At least let Dr Russell go . 'And deprive you of YOUR companion ? ' We have brought the supplies . Sir . 'Everything that was on the list . 'Where do you want them ? ' 'Just set them down where you 're standing . ' It 's all accounted for . 'I 'll see for myself . 'Ah ! 'Dear me , do I detect a weapon ? ' No , this is a comlock . It 's part of our inter-communication system . 'Indeed . 'Ah , me . It 's no use trusting humans . 'Always trying out your mindless schemes . 'Do you think me a fool ? 'Get out of here with those weapons . ' But the Professor . You said we ... 'That was before your treachery . 'Now the Professor stays with me . 'Get out ! ' You 're not letting him go ? 'Tell your men to return to their craft 'before I do something you 'll regret . ' Alan ! Yes , Commander . Fire at the door ! Now ! 'What a pitiful attempt ! 'You 're only good for killing each other . 'Gwent giveth 'and Gwent taketh away . 'Ah , well . 'Perhaps some small use can be made of your experience , 'Professor Bergman . 'Get out 'before I kill you . 'Get out ! 'You are defenceless against me . 'No more demonstrations . 'Now , my dear companions . 'Get those supplies . 'Come along . 'Come on , come on . 'This one first . 'Hurry , please . 'Hurry ! 'Open it . 'Open it ! 'Over here . Here . 'Insert it . Here . Quickly . 'Quickly . 'Quickly ... ' No . 'When will you learn to obey ? ' What 's the matter , Gwent ? You tiring , Gwent ? You didn 't hurt us so much that time . Are you immortal , Gwent ? 'I have enough energy left to destroy you and your entire base . 'I warn you . ' All right , then . Come on and get it over with . 'I demand your cooperation . ' Cooperation ? ! Who the hell are you ? We don 't know who you are , where you 've been or where you 're going . 'I am Delmer Powys Plebus Gwent of the Planet Zemo . 'A man of considerable importance on that planet . 'Perhaps not fully recognised as the scientific genius I am . 'I created this entity . 'An extension of myself . 'My entire personality is here . 'Combined with it is the superior ability 'of a computer 's brain and all the might known to our planet . 'I am impervious to destruction 'and powerful enough to destroy an entire universe ! 'That is who I am . 'Delmer Powys Plebus Gwent . ' Well , Delmer Powys Plebus Gwent , you have lost ! 'Don 't ! ' 'Please . You can expend your last energies destroying us , if you wish . But in the end , you will die . 'I misjudged you . 'My experience over these years 'travelling the universe alone , blind , dependent on Companion 'has left me untrusting , 'suspicious , 'cynical , 'perhaps paranoid . 'You see , having built this ... 'yes ... machine 'to preserve my personality , 'I discovered too late 'its inherent weakness . 'I need company . 'None of us exists except in relation to others . 'Alone , we cease to have personalities . 'Isolation . 'Do you understand ? ' Oh , my dear Gwent . You were wrong from the beginning . To attempt to preserve one 's personality is the ultimate vanity . 'Yes . 'Yes , you 're right . 'It was vanity . 'The first and last of all sins . 'I would like ... 'to thank you . 'I welcome my release . ' The oxygen 's going . Gwent ! Open the door and let us out ! Gwent ! We 've been too successful . He 's killed himself . And us with him . 'Commander Koenig . 'Commander Koenig . 'Come in , Commander . Can you hear me ? 'Main Mission calling Commander Koenig . 'Commander Koenig . 'Come in , Commander . ' 'Main Mission calling Commander Koenig . 'What 's happened ? ' Kano ... Gwent is dead . We 're locked in here . 'We 've dispatched an Eagle . ' No use . You can 't get in . Gwent . Save us . No , not the lights . Oxygen . Oxygen . Open the door . - I 'm all right . - Are you sure ? Yeah . 'Goodbye ... 'dear friends . ' - Sure you 're all right ? - I 'm fine . It 's alive . It 's coming straight towards us . Quick , Sandra . Get him on visual . It 's not lifting up . A lonely , blind creature looking for his death .

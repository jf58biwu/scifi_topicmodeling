 ( SNARLING ) ( DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE ) ( BARKING ) Jack . That 's it , Jack . We met up at Whitecross with Charlie before they moved back to Challoner , before Charlie put the phone in . Yes . He went off in the blue with Greg and that Norwegian girl . Must be six months since . What 's he doing this way ? Charlie never said . I don 't like the fever . Well , I couldn 't just leave him , could I ? I don 't like the fever . Perhaps they 've got it at Challoner . No . No , he would have said . Charlie would have said . He got no rash or nothing , has he ? No lumps under his arms and that ? - No . - ( COUGHING ) What 's the time ? It 's too late for Challoner now , we 'll have to wait till morning . Shouldn 't you get his clothes off ? No . Keep him warm , sweat it out . Fetch another blanket . ( QUIVERING ) SETH : What 's that ? " Charles Vaughan . " " Jenny Richards . " Letters for Charlie and Jenny ? What 's he ... - What 's he doing with them ? - Well , there 's only one way to find out . No ! No , not before asking . We 'll ask in the morning . SETH : Charlie ? CHARLES : Yes , Seth . Charlie , listen , I found Jack . He 's in a bad way . He got two letters on him . He 's got what ? Two letters . One for you and one for Jenny . I 've got them here , do you want me to open them ? - Greg . - What 's that ? - It 's got to be . - What 's that , Charlie ? ( STAMMERING ) Sorry . Seth . Yes , listen . You can open mine . No , no , wait . Um ... Seth , I 'm coming over . I 'll be over to you as soon as I can . - Right . Charlie ? - Yes ? He 's sick . He 's got a fever . - Is it bad ? - Bad enough . He 's in a coma . Seth , is it plague ? No , I don 't think so . All right , Seth , I 'm coming over . - Don 't forget to disconnect . - Right . ( HANGS UP PHONE ) ( WIND HOWLING ) JENNY : I 'm coming , too . And there 's nothing you can do to stop me . Jack has got a fever . He 's also got a letter from Greg . - Now , we don 't know that . - ( SCOFFS ) Who else ? It 's dangerous . I don 't care . She 's right , Charlie . It 's 50 miles . I 'll be back tomorrow night . - If you 're lucky . - Look , a bit of patience . You must be joking . No news for six months and then a letter ? ( GRUNTS ) Can 't you do any better than that ? I 'd like to see you do better . Here you are . All you have to do is warm it up . Ah , thanks . And Charlie , don 't give it all to Seth . ( LAUGHS ) Here . Now , with a bit of luck , we should be there by 4 : 00 so don 't forget to man the phone . I will if I 'm well enough . What 's the matter with you , Hubert ? - I 've got a terrible toothache . - Oh , that 's tough . You man the phone . Yeah , all right . Now , we 'll keep going ... Whoa ! Even if it 's dark . So we ought to be there by at least 8 : 00 . HUBERT : Okay , okay . Oh , please Charlie , don 't travel in the dark . Bye . See you tomorrow night . ( GRUNTING ) He 's writing from a place in Suffolk , Willingham . Is the girl with him , Agnes ? Yes , and he says they 're both all right . And how about Jack ? Well , he 's not so but it 's not plague and he 's no worse . - Well , that 's something , I suppose . - Now , Hubert ... - Yeah . - Are you listening ? Yeah , I can hear you . I can hear you , Charles . Hubert , they got to Norway . Did they , by heck ? Yes , and he says it looks good there . But they need help , they need food and they need people and they need them quickly . Well , what 's to do , then ? We 'll just have to wait till Greg gets here . Well , when 's that ? Well , by my reckoning he ... he wrote the letter about a week ago , so it 's taken Jack that long to get here . Now , Greg 's on his way back and he says he 's going to talk to as many people on the way as he can . Oh . Look , I 'd better be going . Tell Pet I 'll be there tomorrow night . Yeah , okay . I want to be with him . Of course you do . Won 't be long now . No , I want to go to him . Jenny , he wrote that letter over a week ago . He won 't be there any more . He 'll be on his way back . No , he 's going to other places . On the way , yes . I told myself he was dead . Well , he isn 't , is he ? I need him . Just as he needs you . He 's got that other girl . He 's got Agnes . Look . Jenny , love . To Greg there 's only one thing more important than getting his blessed machinery going , and that 's you . ( SNIFFLING ) Then why doesn 't he come back to me ? SUSAN : Oh , let her be . She 's tired and hungry . Come on , get yourself outside some of that . ( SOBBING ) ( GROANS ) You ain 't had a mouthful . Pet cooked it , you know . I didn 't . Oh , Susan , it 's not that . I 'm ... I 'm just not hungry . Well , you ought to be after riding all day . You 'll make yourself ill . And for what , I 'd like to know ? If you 're not hungry , I mean , if you really don 't want ... Oh , no you don 't . Well , there 's no sense in letting it go to waste . It won 't go to waste . They 're yours , Seth . - You 're a big man . - He 's a big pig . JACK : No ! No ! No , you can 't ... can 't do that . You can 't ... Greg ! Greg ! Greg . Jenny , no ! Greg . Jack , it 's all right . Jack , it 's Jenny . Can you hear what I 'm saying ? Jack , it 's Jenny . Jack ! Jack , can you hear what I 'm saying ? ( INDISTINCT MUMBLING ) What are you saying ? ( MUMBLING ) Jack . Jack , listen to me , it 's Jenny ! Ag ... Agnes ! Greg ... They can 't do it , you know ... A broken arm . Help me ! Help me ! ( COUGHING ) He 's in trouble . - Take it easy , love . - I think Greg 's in trouble . - Easy , easy . - I 'm ... I 'm going to him . Now , Jenny ... Jenny . Jack is delirious . I 'm going to him , I tell you , I 'm going to him . - Yes , yes , of course you are ... - He 's in trouble . He 's broken his arm ! We 'll go there just as soon as I get the horses ... No , we 're going now ! If you 're not going , I 'm going because I don 't think ... How is he ? He seems to have settled down again . Now , Jenny , love . Listen . We 'll go first thing in the morning as soon as it 's light . - They what ? - They went off at first light . What for ? Oh , something about Greg and a broken leg . Something about ? ( GRUNTING ) This tooth . Oh , it 's giving me jip . That doesn 't affect your hearing . That 's all you know , ear , nose and throat . Oh , got teeth in your throat now , have you ? Well , if you 're feeling so poorly , I 'll take the 12 : 00 phone call . Suit yourself . - How is he ? - No change . I had to cut the clothes off and they were all caked with blood . These gashes , they don 't look very nice . They 're all inflamed . Do you think you can find me some shepherd 's purse ? - Some what ? - Some shepherd 's purse to put on him . I saw some in the long meadow down by the pigpen . Oh , yeah , I 'll look . ( GROANING ) Jack ? Dry . Remember me ? Seth , the blacksmith . And Susan , at Lyndon . ( CHUCKLES ) Here , I found you in a tree . - Dogs . - That 's what I thought . Dogs got my horse . Well , lucky they didn 't get you . - Greg , Agnes ... - Yeah , it 's all right . Charlie and Jenny have gone after them to warn them . - Charlie ? - And Jenny . They left this morning . - No , they mustn 't . - What ? - They can 't do that to him . - What , Jack ? - He 'll kill him . He 'll be killed . - What 's that ? Tear him to pieces . - What 's he saying ? - It 's the fever . - Miedel . - SUSAN : What ? Stop him . He 'll kill him . Miedel . ( COUGHS ) What 's he saying ? - Sounded like Miedel . - Miedel ? And talk of killing . - Dogs . - No ! " He 'll kill him , " he say . That 's what he say , " He 'll kill him . " But what does it mean ? SETH : You know , that 's all he said before we went into a coma again . Seth , what am I going to do ? I don 't know , um ... Don 't rightly know . I reckon someone ought to go after them and warn them . - Go after them ? - Well , there 's time . They 've only been gone six hours . With two horses , you ought to catch up , they 've got to rest . But there 's no one here . They 're all at Whitecross . I 'd go if I could , but we 've got no horses , you know . Seth , there 's only Hubert and me here and I have to look after the children and Hubert can 't ride . Who says I can 't ? I can ride better than what you can . Oh , Hubert , don 't be so tiresome . This is no time for boasting . Who 's boasting ? I tell you , I 'm fed up ! Treated like a dogsbody . It 's time I had a bit of respect . I could ride before you was born . And I 'd be after them two like a shot , I would . If I wasn 't crippled . - Crippled ? - ( SHOUTING ) This tooth ! ( GROANING ) Hubert , if you can ride , I can give you something for your tooth . What ? Something put by . What , medicinal ? That 's right . Medicinal . Whoa ! ( SNORING ) Hurts , does it ? Aye . Come on . There you go . What 's wrong ? Uh ... She 's been favouring a leg . It 's very hot and swollen . Oh , no ! Oh , she 'll be all right if we leave her here . She 'll get better . Hide the saddle away . We 'll collect them both when we come back . - It 's going to be dark soon . - Aye . Better eat that up . You know what Pet 's like . She 's worse than Jenny . - You know what I think ? - What ? - She 's not coming back . - Who ? - Jenny . - Why ? Don 't know . Women 's intuition . Into what ? Not " into " anything . Intuition . What women know without knowing why . That 's daft . No , it isn 't . Boys don 't know everything . Come on , you two . It 's long past your bedtime . How long will Jenny take to find Greg ? Well , with any luck she might be there by tomorrow . Now , no delaying tactics . Drink up . ( EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST ) We must be nearly there . ( SCREAMING ) MAN : Help me ! Help me . ( BABBLING ) Help ! Help me , they 're crazy ! ( SCREAMING ) Please ! - Stay here . - No . Well , then , keep behind me . MAN : Please help me ! Help me , for God 's sake ! Help me ! ( SCREAMING ) Help me ! Mummy ! ( CONTINUES BABBLING ) Mum ! Help . Help me ! Mum ! What happened ? Who did this to you ? Hmm ? What 's happening ? Who are you ? Where are you from ? Are you from Willingham ? Okay , listen , we 're friends , do you understand ? Friends . Now , tell us what 's the matter and we 'll help you . ( GRUNTING ) Charles , I 'm frightened . You know , if I didn 't know any different - I 'd say that kid was a junkie . - A what ? A junkie , on drugs . You 'd be right . Who are you and what do you want ? My name is Charles Vaughan and this is Jenny Preston . Richards . There seems to be some doubt about it . Richards is my maiden name . Hmm . And may I ask what you 're doing here ? We 're looking for a man , Greg Preston . He wrote to us over a week ago from here . He 's got a Norwegian girl with him , Agnes . - Your husband ? - We 're not married . But you cohabit with him ? No , not for six months . Hmm , I see . - Are you alone ? - CHARLES : How do you mean ? In coming here . Well , just Jenny and me , yes . What do you know of this place ? Just what we 've seen , coming here . They released Roberts . All right , Jeff , you needn 't hang about . You seem very well organised . We have to be . Did Preston tell you anything about what we do here in his letter ? Where is Greg ? - He 's not still here ? - No . - But he 's all right ? - As far as we know . Mr Vaughan ? He said you had a scientist here , a chemist . He said he was a very valuable man . Yes . - Do please sit down . - We 'd rather stand , thanks . Preston left here a week ago . We did our best to persuade him to stay but he was in a great hurry to get back to you . With a broken arm ? - I beg your pardon ? - JENNY : Greg broke his arm . Really ? And when did he do that ? Well , it must have been when he was here . - We were told Greg broke his arm . - By whom ? - By Jack . - Jack ? Jack Wood . He brought us the letters from Greg . Ah , yes , the sentimentalist . - He is more confused than I thought . - He was delirious . He had a very bad cold when he left . We did try to warn him but he insisted on travelling . - But Greg 's all right ? - I can assure you Preston is alive , uninjured and making his way back to you as fast as that Norwegian girl will let him . Her impatience is understandable . Her countrymen are desperate . We have two of them here . They came over with Preston and the girl . We 're doing what we can but it takes time . So what do you do ? Apart from staking out kids for dog bait ? We make drugs . I heard we had visitors . Let me introduce Professor Miedel . - Jenny Richards , Charles Vaughan . - Welcome ! Welcome . Eh , please forgive this , it was an accident . - Broken ? - Unfortunately . At my age , it is easily done . - They 're friends of Greg Preston . - Yes . He talked a great deal about you both . But to see you here , this is a surprise . A most pleasant surprise . Eh , he wrote to you ? Yes , I ... We were worried about him . We 've not seen him for six months . Of course . A very remarkable man . To make the journey to Norway and back , a brave man . A man of great determination . - A man to be proud of . - Yes . But why are you standing and why have you not been offered refreshment ? Michael , where are your manners ? No , please , we have to go on . - Go on ? - JENNY : After Greg . But that 's impossible . - Why ? - After such a journey . You must have been travelling for days . Four . - Then you would have met him . - No . They were going on to a place called Nettleton . - Nettleton ? - Lincolnshire . They are following a list of places , a list made up by the girl 's father . There 's a metal worker in Nettleton . Wrought iron . How far is it ? My dear young lady , it is at least a week since they left . You will at least stay here tonight . I think we should go on . - With one tired horse ? - You see ? I thought perhaps you would lend us horses . Of course , but tomorrow . I absolutely insist that you stay overnight . - Thank you . - Good . I 'll see to it . Be sure we will make you most comfortable . ( SIGHS ) ( SNORING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( RATS SQUEAKING ) I am attempting to synthesise a substitute for pethidine . What 's that ? ( LAUGHING ) Ah , yes . It is in itself a substitute for morphine . It was used in Germany during the Hitler war . Uh , the opium poppy does not grow here , you understand . It was imported from Turkey . And of course , the stocks are no more . As a matter of fact , I probably scavenged the last of it from a factory near Nottingham . I have some left , not much . I keep it for the real emergencies . And for a control . No . Without opium , no morphine . And it is far too expensive to synthesise . Expensive ? I speak in terms of time . The raw materials are difficult to come by and the process is a long one . No . A synthesis of pethidine is the answer . Yes . Well , it certainly sounds as if you 're onto a good thing . None better . But then , it has been my life . CHARLES : What do you do with your drugs ? Do with them ? Well , even on the National Health , there was a prescription charge . Charge ? There is no charge . - You mean the drugs are given away ? - But of course . Then how do you live ? - Please ? - You eat and drink , presumably . You seem reasonably well looked after . Ah , yes , I understand . There is a small levy , of course . Oh , of course . Of course . How small ? Oh , Mr Vaughan . - I am disappointed in you . - Are you ? Clearly you have been talking to one of our malcontents . Have I ? We ask for the raw materials plus our subsistence , and that is all . Well , that sounds fair enough , but who fixes the levy ? You or your friend Michael ? From each according to his ability , to each according to his needs . Oh , where have I heard that before ? We apply the principle here . It is often misunderstood . Quite often was , as I remember . ( GROANS ) Mr Vaughan , a person in pain will very naturally object to the provision of a very large amount of willow tree bark in exchange for a very small amount of acetylsalicylic acid . - What 's that ? - Aspirin . A man who has been brought up in a corrupt economic system will not be any more reasonable with a bad headache . So you soften him up by leaving him for the dogs . I 'm sorry , I don 't understand . We came across one of your malcontents on our way here . He was staked out on the ground . Crucified . We let him go . His name , I believe , was Roberts . - Roberts ? - CHARLES : Yes , that 's right . ( SPEAKING IN GERMAN ) - You let him go ? - If that 's all right with you . Was he harmed ? Depends how you mean . He looked pretty ill to me . Yes . This is terrible . I 'm sorry that you had to see it . Oh , you mean as a rule you keep it better hidden . I mean , Mr Vaughan , that I did not know of it . Well , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to upset you . Guest quarters are ready . Ah , Jeffrey , thank you . Will you please go with Maria ? She will see to it that you are comfortable . Do we have a choice ? Yes , Mr Vaughan . But I ask you to go . Charles , please . MIEDEL : Yes . Please . Eh , Jeffrey ? Will you please ask Colonel Clifford to come and see me ? Yes , Professor . ( GROANING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( EXHALES ) ( MOANS ) Are you challenging the way I run things ? In this , yes . Such treatment was inhuman . - No . That 's an exaggeration . - Exaggeration ? Vaughan and the woman , they 're overreacting . - And I 'm not ? - You , too . You 're all ... - Let 's say you 're mistaken . - Mistaken ! My methods are my own . I 'm accountable to no one . - It 's barbaric ! - I 'm no barbarian . But we have to be tough . It negates all we stand for here . No , it protects what we stand for . - It protects you . - No ! Not like that . Face facts . You were nearly killed last week . - No ! - No , no . No , Listen to me , please . What happens to all we have here with you dead ? Killed by something like Roberts ? - He didn 't mean to ! - What does that alter ? What you 've got in your head isn 't in books . They 're just records . You 've got a couple of half-trained students . Can you think of anything more lethal than a half-trained chemist ? We 've got enough problems keeping the rabble out . Roberts isn 't rabble . When he did that to you , I let him go because you interceded . He knew what to expect if he came back to steal and he came back last night ! Roberts is not responsible for what he does ! Geert , come down from those academic clouds . The old liberalism is dead . It died of the plague . A junkie is what he is by choice . If we 'd been tougher in the old days , we might have stamped it out . As it was , we gave them prescriptions . They queued at chemist shops . And then went away to have their blissful dreams in filthy corners . My dear Michael , - people with pain can 't ... - With pain ? Or without guts ? ( EXHALES ) Guest quarters ? It 's another name for a prison . No warders . Charles , let 's go . - Go where ? - After Greg . Without horses ? - They must let us have horses . - Must they ? If Clifford doesn 't want them to , they won 't . Why should he want to keep us here ? I don 't know . Perhaps Greg and Agnes are still here . What ? Why ? I 'm not sure . There 's too many questions , Jenny . Why should Greg write praising this place ? It 's obvious to anyone with even half an eye that something is very wrong here . And why should Jack be so worried about a broken arm , even if he was delirious ? I think Miedel was telling the truth . Hmm , maybe . And perhaps the old man doesn 't know it all . It 's pretty obvious who 's the boss man . Greg still here ... - Perhaps he found out something . - About what ? About Clifford . Oh , it doesn 't take much figuring out , does it ? They 've got something here that everybody wants and Clifford 's screwing them . And you know Greg . Yes , but why should they keep him here ? Charles , he 's not dead . Is he ? Oh , Jenny . Jenny . I 'm going to have a look around . You stay here . No , I 'm coming , too . Yeah , so people raid the place . Mind you , this Colonel character , this Clifford , he 's in his element . Do you know what he does if they catch somebody ? He stakes them out for the dogs . Yeah . Takes them out to the settlement and pegs them to the ground . I 've met some cold-blooded devils in my time , but that one beats bullfighting . I just hope he catches them in time to warn them . - Who ? - Charles and Jenny . - No . I mean , who 's gone after them ? - Oh , Hubert . Hubert ? ( CHATTERING ) Mr Vaughan ? Can I help ? Ah , no . No , thanks . Just ... Just taking a look around . - No one 's allowed in there . - Oh ! Er , why ? Regulations . Ah . Well , there seems to be a lot of coming and going . - Authorised personnel . - Oh , and we 're not ? - Sorry . - Yeah . So am I. How are you going to stop us ? Shoot us ? If I have to . - You 're joking . - No . All I have to do is hit you in the leg . Yes . Well ... Hmm . ( SIGHS ) ( YELLS ) Run , Jenny ! ( MEN GRUNTING ) JEFFREY : Thank you . I 'd better take him to the Colonel . You 'd better stay , Jeff , in case of any violent disagreement . What were you looking for ? - Where 's Jenny ? - She won 't get far . And she 'll come to no harm . ( SCOFFS ) What were you looking for ? Greg Preston ! ( GROANS ) - Why should you think he 's here ? - Because you say he isn 't . You know , I don 't fancy your chances . - Of what ? - Of federating . Unifying us , the survivors . Isn 't that what you and Preston want to do ? We talked about it . You 'll need to develop skills I don 't think you have . - Such as ? - Diplomacy . Politics . - The art of devious manoeuvre . - We can 't all be alike . You won 't get through to the frightened and suspicious if you 're frightened and suspicious yourself . When a cannibal entertains you to dinner , you don 't sit by the pot and ask him who 's cooking . He might interpret that as criticism and then it gets ... Greg Preston ! What makes you so suspicious ? Greg appeared to like it here . From what I 've seen , he must have been totally deluded . - Yes , of course . - Well , what does that mean ? It means that in your shoes , I 'd probably feel the same . - Would you ? - Oh , yes . Since Preston was here , we 've been under attack twice . - From whom ? - From the frightened . The ignorant , the greedy , the dropouts . - That sounds very glib . - I 've had a lot of practice . Preston took a different view from you . As did Carlsson before him . - Who 's Carlsson ? - You don 't know ? Oh , the Norwegian . They took a different view because I was in the background . Geert Miedel is what this place is all about . - I 'm only a soldier . - You could have fooled me . You have every right to be sour but no right to a closed mind . Now , will you please hear me out ? - I 'll try ! - Good . We 're a small group here . A small , specialist group . 33 of us , 35 as of 10 days ago . Preston left behind a couple of Norwegian students . They 're here to study Miedel 's methodology and take it back with them . He 's a brilliant , saintly old man . He came over from Germany in 1936 and has been avoiding unpleasantness ever since . A place like this was his dream when he came through the plague , and it would have remained a dream if I hadn 't happened along and realised it . ( SCOFFS ) Only a soldier . - An open mind . - Sorry . This place is a pharmaceutical factory . But a factory needs raw materials and its workers need feeding . We get our raw materials and food from other communities . In return , we give them what we produce . Anything from aspirin to synthesised plaster of Paris . So why the aggro ? The aggro comes from misinformation , ignorance , suspicion . - You provide a good example . - Oh , thank you ! Your sarcasm proves my point . The chemical processing here requires raw materials in bulk . And there 's very little to show as an end product . ( COUGHS ) So , your suppliers accuse you of extortion . Exactly . - But there 's nothing in the accusation ? - Nothing . Then why aren 't you believed ? As I 've said , ignorance and greed , inherited habits of thought . Drugs are now more precious than gold ever was . But surely this can be explained ? That 's been tried . But ignorant and greedy people get violent . Miedel was attacked last week . He was lucky to get away with a broken arm . I can 't afford to take risks . Without him there is nothing . He 's training a successor but that takes time , hence the tight security . What about that kid Roberts ? He was kicked out six months ago for stealing opium . When we had some raw stuff imported . He was Miedel 's student . And he dropped out . One of the kind who can 't face the world as it is , - only as they 'd like it to be . - He sounds a bit like me . Which is why I 'm careful . He 's tolerated in a primitive group about 15 miles from here . He stirs them up from time to time . And there are kids like him . They 're after the muscarine alkaloid we extract from the Amanita mushroom . - The what ? - It 's a substitute for LSD . Why do you make it ? Miedel needs it to make a substitute morphine . The stuff he gave himself when I set his arm . Oh , to let a kid be eaten alive by dogs ! - ( LAUGHING ) Dramatic , don 't you think ? - What 's funny ? A professional soldier doesn 't enjoy killing , Vaughan . - We leave that to the amateurs . - There are exceptions . Seven people were killed here in the last year , two of them ours . All of them unavoidably and none of them by dogs . Oh , that 's lucky ! You came in from the west . If you 'd come in from the other side , the side most of our neighbours come in from , then you would have seen a skeleton . It 's staked out . Just as Roberts was . Anybody who cares to examine it closely will find it 's made of plastic . Only nobody ever does . Jeff pinched it from Miedel 's stuff . Only , don 't tell him , please . Now , wait a minute . A kid was staked out and we came ... - And watched by Jeff . - Where they can 't see me . Did you have any trouble in releasing him ? It 's easy enough for them to loosen a hand , once they stop panicking . And the self-congratulation helps spread the word around . It 's a little trick I learned in Malaya . - And you get away with it ? - Up until now , yes . So , keep it to yourself . Well , what happens when you get rumbled ? When your bluff 's called ? Then I 'll stop bluffing . Miedel and what he 's doing must be protected . Yes . Yes , I see . ( EXHALES ) Look ... - I 'm sorry . - What for ? - I misjudged you . - Oh , I don 't think so , Vaughan . I 'm not squeamish and I don 't ask to be loved . But you and Preston are in for a tough time . - Oh , that 's pessimistic . - Realistic . Well , there are still decent and reasonable people left . Oh , yes . Enough ? Well , that 's what we 've got to find out , isn 't it ? Good luck . Yeah . I got to find Jenny . She 'll be all right . Jeff . ( GROANS ) Sit down . JENNY : Stop ! Help me ! ( PANTING ) Hubert ! - Hubert ! Hubert . - ( SCREAMS ) Oh ! Mind me tooth ! Oh , oh . ( RUSTLING ) Hubert ? Cartridges ! ( FOOTSTEPS RUSTLING ) - It 's all right . - JENNY : Stay back ! It 's all right , I tell you . It 's the girl ! She 's got a gun and there 's someone with her . JENNY : Charles ! Charles ! Get down . How many are you ? - How many of you are there ? - 20 . Get the others . JENNY : Charles ? Charles . CLIFFORD : Lock them up . JEFFREY : Come . ( GROANING ) ( GASPS ) CLIFFORD : Where are the others ? JENNY : Wake up . Hubert , wake up . I 'm afraid you need a great deal more treatment than I can give you , but here 's a souvenir . Whoa ! Well , I 'm glad to be rid of that . ( MIEDEL CHUCKLING ) Wish I could say the same . - Oh , Charles ! - All right , all right . Thank God I know where to come to next time . ( SPEAKING GERMAN ) - ( LAUGHING ) And what does that mean ? - It means " good luck " . - And you 're going to need it . - Well , good luck to you . - We 're going to need you . - Oh , that 's better . A distinct improvement . CHARLES : Let 's go . - Auf wiedersehen . - Auf wiedersehen . Geert . You 're a sentimental old fool . Come on . We 've got work to do . Come on , Charles , please . - What 's that , Hubert ? - Oh , it tastes like gin . ( COUGHS ) Did you steal it ? Plenty of it about . - You 'd better be careful , Hubert . - Yeah . Come on .

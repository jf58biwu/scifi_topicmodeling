 [ GUNFIRE ] [ DISTANT EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE ] - Selson . - Sir . - That 's the third staircase , isn 't it ? . - Yes , sir . They 're getting closer every minute , sir . I can see that . - Where are they now ? . - They 're just about here , sir . [ GUNFIRE ] [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Control . Mm . Right . The Albians have broken though into the outer gallery , sir . The field commander reports that despite severe losses , our men are putting up a courageous defence . Yes , spare me the propaganda , Selson . Can he hold them ? . He 's concentrating what 's left of his force to make a stand at level three , sir . If they beat him at level three , there 's little margin left . He 'll hold them , sir . I 'd like a little more reassurance than your blind patriotism , Selson . Put the status report on the computer and run a probability program . Sir . [ EXPLOSIONS ] [ DISTANT EXPLOSIONS ] They 're dropping bombs down the airshafts now . Computer analysis indicates a ninety-three percent probability that the Albians will overwhelm our defences and take control of the entire complex . On the evidence of that projection , we have no alternative . - We must activate . - Sir ? ! . - T ronos , lock the door . - Sir ? . Lock the door ! Is there nothing else we can do , sir ? . It means the death of millions . The Albians always knew the penalty for insurrection . Now they must pay the cost . But sir , there 's still a seven percent possibility we can contain the situation . - Couldn 't we wait a little longer , sir ? . - No ! Now then , T ronos , you know what to do . I give you four minutes to reach the launch area , then I activate . I then follow without delay . Right . We 'll see you at the ship . Four minutes . [ EXPLOSION ] [ DISTANT EXPLOSION ] Selson ! It 's no good , sir . There 's no way through ; it 's blocked . You must try and get back , sir , you must try and get back and stop , ahhh . [ HAMMERING ON DOOR ] Del , stop him ! - It 's started . - I always thought they were bluffing I never thought that when it actually came to it they 'd REALLY activate ! You 'd better believe it , Cauder . Believe it and do something fast . That thing is ticking away the lives of everybody on this planet . I 'd say we have less than an hour . Ralli , get Vetnor up here , I want to know exactly what we 're up against . And then put out a general call for anybody who can give help . Right away . And when you 've done that , get this place cleaned up , get a casualty report , and get some Federation prisoners for questioning . And while I 'm doing all that , what are you going to do ? . Worry , that 's what I 'm going to do ... worry . You 've got good cause . Sorry , Cauder . I won you a battle , but I lost you a war . Let 's get communications started . - I 've got the read-out you wanted on Albian . - Good . Nothing very special . Temperate climate in the equatorial zone , but both Polar Regions are uninhabitable . - Temperatures remaining close to absolute zero . - Sounds bracing . - Population ? . - Approximately six million . It was colonised in the last century of the Old Calendar . At first they resisted political affiliation , but then they joined the Federation , and they have remained unswervingly loyal . Then they 're not likely to welcome us with open arms . I hope we 're not going to be there long enough to sample their hospitality . - This is a fast hit and run . - What are we after ? . A Federation officer called Provine . His record shows he 's served with Central Control . I hope he might be able to tell us quite a lot about where they 've moved it to . - There 's something coming in from Albian . - What is it ? . Well , it 's a very weak signal but as far as I can make out there 's been some fighting . The main text is just a general call for technical assistance and it 's repeated over and over again . - Could be some sort of uprising . - Get a locator fix on the signal . - It 's already pinpointed . - Well done . All right , Avon , get kitted up . You too , Vila . Good , terrific ... I 'm really looking forward to this . Danger , excitement , sudden death ... I can 't wait . What 's the matter with you , don 't you ever give up ? . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] That 's it , Blake ... navigation plot completed . We 're locked into stationary orbit within teleport range of planet Albian . Get your gear . I don 't know , just don 't know . Some of the circuitry 's fairly basic , that I understand , the rest ... Oh , come on , Vetnor , there must be something you can do ! This is life and death , it must be stopped ! There is one thing , might just work . Might , I can 't be sure . If I 'm wrong ... - We won 't be here to worry , will we ? . - Could it detonate ? . - I don ' t know , there 's always that risk . - Everything we 've done so far has been risk . We 're getting very close to nothing to lose . We 've got to chance it . - What is it you want to do ? . - There 's a main rotonoid link . If I cut through its primary impulse vein , it might break the circuit . Then again ... It might not . We 'll chance it . [ SMALL DETONATION ] We 've stopped it ! It hiccoughed , that 's all . Sorry . I don 't know what else to try . That 's all right , Vetnor , you did what you could . We 'll think of something else . - We 've just taken another step towards oblivion . - What do you want , Ralli ? . We 've got some prisoners . You said you wanted to question . Yes , I do ! Is Space Major Provine amongst them ? . Well if he is he hasn 't been identified yet . I 've got men checking the prisoners ' identity papers . What about the dead , are you checking them , too ? - Yes , of course . - Well , I hope for all our sakes ' he has survived If he has , we have to find him ; he 's the only one who knows the complete system . How will we know him if we find him ? By his identity papers and his uniform . As far as I know , none of our people have seen him . Come on ; let 's get the questioning started . Ralli , you go through those files . Find the plans for that thing . All right , Vetnor . I 'm sorry I couldn 't do the job . It needs tools I haven 't got . - Well , you 'd better go and help look for prisoners . - Right . Can you correlate the locator fix to this ? . How about this ? . But that puts it right in the middle of the Federation defence complex . Well , we can put you one half co-ordinate point to the fix . That will put you down in the outer limits of the complex . That 'll do . Let 's go . Come on , Vila . - You 're quite sure you need me ? . - Certain . Doesn 't it make you feel good to be wanted ? . I 've been a wanted man all my life . What I need now is to be unwanted . - Come on . Put us down , Jenna . - Good luck . It must have been quite a fight . These men are from the Federation Assault Force . They 're crack troops . It 's quiet enough now . The battle seems to be over . - Just one thing we don 't know : who won ? . - Let 's find out . Not that way . Let 's look at some of the other levels first . Why ? . I 'd rather not meet anyone until we get the geography of this place sorted out . Men fresh from a battle tend to be a little trigger-happy . - T rigger-happy ? . - It would be stupid to be shot up by our own allies . Not only stupid , painful . - It 's locked . - Allow me . [ LOCK DECOUPLING ] You see , the old magic 's still there . The old ego , too . - It 's a rocket launch pad ! - What do you make of it ? . - I 'm not sure . - Vila , take a look around . This is the specification . It 's fast but short-range . It has a life-support capability of about a hundred space hours . But the nearest habitable planet to Albian is over five hundred space hours away . Then it would probably have to rendezvous with a mother ship . Or come back to Albian . I don 't see the point in having a rocket like that here . Just in case of emergencies , perhaps . Come on , let 's go . There 's nothing else for us here . - Blake , look ! - What is it ? . There 's a sliding section in the roof , they 're launch doors Why don 't you do that again , maybe they didn 't hear you . Wait for me ! [ THUD ] - Stand where you are ! Lower your guns . - Easy now , we 're not Federation . - Don 't move . Now who are you ? . - I 'm Blake . This is Avon and Vila . Blake ? . You mean the Blake who 's been giving the Federation so much trouble ? . We 've certainly been trying and from what we see here , you 've been doing the same thing . How did you get here ? . Our ship has teleport capability . We came down from the rocket level . - Rockets ? . Where ? . - Two levels up . You two : find that rocket and stay with it . If Provine 's alive it 'll be his escape route . My name 's Cauder . I 'm glad to see you , Blake , all three of you . - We have a desperate problem . - Can we help ? . If you can 't , every living being on this planet will be dead within hours . Come with me . Oh dear . - This is a solium radiation device . - Solium ? . - You know about it ? . - Enough to know that it 's deadly . Once in fission it creates intense radiation . It destroys living tissue instantly . That 's right , and the Federation made us understand exactly its effects , left us in no doubt if we mounted any major rebellion they wouldn 't hesitate to use it . But to blow up the whole planet , destroy everything 's that 's here , that 's stupid . But they don 't blow it up , that 's the point . Solium itself produces a very small explosion and the radiation fall-out decays rapidly . They could wipe out a whole population and still leave the buildings and the installations intact . In less than a day there is no trace of any radiation . See what you can do with it . Typical Federation policy : things are more important than people . The Federation was bleeding us dry . They levied impossible demands on our economy , gave us no voice in our own government . We were little better than slaves on our own planet . It 's a familiar pattern . Go on . So we decided to cede from the Federation . Oh , we tried to do it legally , went through all the normal diplomatic patterns , through all the interplanetary laws , but none of it did any good . They declared a state of emergency and placed Albian under martial law . But policing a planet of this size must tie down a fairly considerable Federation force . - No . They had less than a hundred troops here . - What ? . They had an easier way to ensure our loyalty . Simple and terrifying . They installed THAT . Yes , must 've been like living with a gun against your heads . That 's right . And that is why we were finally driven to act . We knew the enormity of the risk but we had to take it . Somehow , I thought when it came to it , they wouldn 't detonate , I thought they were bluffing . I was wrong . Now unless we can deactivate that , millions will pay for my mistake . I can dismantle the solium device , but first of all I have to find it . This isn 't it . - What ? . - It is a subetheric transmitter that activates remotely . The bomb itself could be anything up to ten thousand miles from here , hidden anywhere on the planet . [ METAL CLATTER ] [ SOLENOID CHARGING ] You 're not going anywhere , Major Provine . The launch doors won 't open ; I 've smashed the relays . Don 't move ! Just throw your gun down , carefully . There where I can see it . Good . Now , we 're going back to the control room and you 're going to deactivate this device . - I can 't do that . - I think we can find ways of convincing you . I didn 't say I wouldn 't , I said I can 't . Once the device is activated it can 't be stopped . - I don 't believe that . - But it 's true It 's out of our control now . Neither I nor anybody else can do anything about it . Now . You listen to me . You can give yourself a chance . - You don 't have to die here with the rest of them . - What do you mean ? . Help me repair the relay . It 's a Stadler link , isn 't it ? . Well , there must be a spare in the technical stores , mustn 't there ? . - Maybe . - Help me find it and we can get the launch doors open . Once we get this ship into orbit , we 'll be safe . We can stay out in space until the radiation decays and then return in perfect safety . - Return to what ? . - This planet is important to the Federation . They 'll bring in settlers , repopulate it . You could play an important part in that . You could have power , position . Help me and you won 't find the Federation ungrateful . - And my family , my friends ? . - I 'm afraid there 's nothing you can do to help them now . Be sensible ; to stay here and die with them achieves nothing . You think I could live , knowing I 'd helped a man who 'd murdered an entire world ? . No , Provine , you 're not going anywhere . You 're going to stay here and die with the rest of us . Now move . - No , wait . - Now move ! You 're a fool . The door . [ DETONATION ] - If there is any information on the location of the device ... - But there must be ! Then the obvious place is the safe . Vila , can you crack it ? . - It 's a tough one , but I 've got the combination . - You have ? . Yes , but the buttons are sensitised to respond only to certain fingerprints . I 've got to bypass all that before I can go to work on the combination mechanisms . If anyone can crack it , he can . Breaking into a Federation stronghold must 've taken some doing . How many men did you have ? . About a hundred and fifty . They came from resistance groups all over the planet . But you planned the organisation . Initially , but it didn 't take me long to realise I 'd need a professional dealer . You mean you hired a mercenary ? . Yes . He organised the revolution on the planet Arcos , others before that . He has a very good record . I made contact . He agreed to help , but demanded a very substantial sum . Mercenaries generally do . No , I think the price was to satisfy his ego , to prove he 's the best in his field . He 's certainly very good at his job to get your men in here . Where is he ? . - He should be back . I 'll fetch him . - Oh , what 's his name ? . - Grant . Del Grant . - What 's the matter ? . Nothing . It 's not important . I was a little surprised , that 's all . - Why ? . Do you know him ? . - I once knew somebody called Del Grant , but it was a long time ago . I doubt that this is the same man . You don 't seem very eager to find out . Why ? . There are matters that remain to be settled between us . - Like what ? . - I told you : it 's not important . If it is not important , then why did his name have such a strong effect upon you ? . Because the Del Grant that I knew said that if we ever met again , he would kill me . I 've done it ! I think I 've done it . I 've isolated the identification sensors . It 's straight combination now . Watch this , it should open like a dream . More like a nightmare . They 're all in code . - So are these . - Give me a little time , I can decode it . Time is what we don 't have . Liberator , this is Blake , do you read me ? . - We hearyou . - Stand by to teleport , Vila 's coming up . I want all that stuff run through Orac , I want the cipher broken , and a full read-out . - Right . - Ready ? . - Yes . - Take him up . - What 's happening down there ? . - I 'll tell you later , no time now . - Well , what 's all the rush ? . - There 's a bomb timed to detonate in under half an hour . We don 't even know where it is . Give me a linkup with Orac . We have now used up more than half the time we have available . - Blake , this is Grant . - Good to meet you . And you . We 've been hearing about your strikes against the Federation . You 've been hitting them pretty hard , too . You keep it up ; you 'll put us out of business . - That I wouldn 't mind . - If it meant breaking the Federation , nor would I. - Hello , Del . It 's been a long time . - I heard you were dead . I heard the same about you . Wishful thinking perhaps . I 'm glad the stories were wrong . I felt cheated . We have some things to settle . You two can talk about the old days some other time . Right now we have a problem that 's just a little more pressing . - What 's the countdown ? . - Four two five . - It 's getting closer . - Vila 's using Liberator 's computers to decipher the code . - It could just give us the location . - I have found the circuit plans Yes , that 's the detonator . A nasty one , tricky to disarm . You would have to take out the secondary circuit first , go in under here . Hmm . Might work . Still , not easy . [ noise ] Cauder ! Ralli ! Ralli , what happened ? . Oh . I don 't know . Someone came up behind me and just hit me . - That 's an escape tunnel . Come on . - You 'll be all right , Ralli . - He 's not long dead . - Get his papers . Where do you think this leads ? . Probably comes out by the rocket silo . Must 've been trying to get to the rocket when the roof caved in . - Who is he ? . - Selson , sergeant , security forces . - Have you searched all the dead and wounded ? . - Most of them . - Any senior officers ? . - No . - He 's got to be here somewhere . - Who has ? . I came down to question a man called Provine , a Space Major . I think that he can help us with the whereabouts of Federation 's Central Control . - There 's no Space Major amongst the prisoners . - Let me try this on you . The complex is under attack ; your men have already penetrated the outer defences . Provine decides to evacuate , he activates the device , starts down the escape tunnel towards the rocket silo . An explosion brings down the roof , and kills this one . Maybe the other one , too . He could be buried further in . No , somebody survived . He waited his chance , went back to the room . When the girl came in and was alone He moved out and hit her . It makes sense . THAT was Provine . If you 're right , he could be still wandering around here somewhere . Yes , come on . I tell you I saw nothing . The only thing I remember is a man in uniform . I just got a glimpse as I blacked out . - He 's got to be found . - I 'll organise a search party . Come on , you need some rest . That last day , when it was all over , did they hurt her ? . They kept her under interrogation for nearly a week . They tried everything but she never broke . If she had spoken , told them what they wanted to know , she 'd be alive now . She should have told them . She held on because she believed in you . She didn 't know that you 'd run out and leave her to face it alone . - That was not the way it was . - I know exactly how it was . She died under Federation torture . But it was you who killed her . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Blake . Go ahead , Jenna . That 's it ; we got it , Blake , the exact position of the installation . I 'm sending Vila down now . Blake , co-ordinates are 1-1 1-7-9 , intersect 4-41 . Stand by , Vila . Coordinate 1-1 1-7-9 , intersect 4-41 . - Are you sure ? . - Orac doesn 't make mistakes . - Then we 're finished . - What do you mean ? . Well , look at that . It 's the polar cap , right in the centre of the ice zone . - Then we 'll have to get to it . - But it 's 4000 miles away . It can 't be done . - It can if we use the teleport . - We can teleport right down to the location . - We 'll need special equipment , thermal clothing . - We 'll do it . Wait . Disarming a device is not your field . You finish what we came here for : find Provine . - I 'll come with you . - No . - I can help . - Look , I don 't know exactly what it is between you , but there 's enough danger without letting personal grudges interfere . That 's something we can settle in our own time . Cauder , what matters is that I can give backup . I 've worked with timing devices . I know the mechanisms . All right , it 's your decision , Avon . Do you want him ? . Give him a bracelet . Vila . Just one thing : if that countdown goes below fifty and the device is still primed you will be teleported out . - Vila and I will do the same . - Understood . Jenna , Cally , prepare thermal equipment . Stand by to teleport , Avon 's coming up . One more thing : if anything happens to Avon , I will come looking for you . Ready ? . Jenna , take us out of here . - Is everything all right ? . - Not exactly . I 'll tell you about it some other time . This is Del Grant , this is Jenna . Cally , get me those co-ordinates . Put on one of those , you 're going to need it . Jenna , I need some high-temperature lances . - Any luck ? . - He 's alive . I know it . He 's here somewhere . - If he is , my men will find him . - It 's a very large area to search . Yes . What would he do ? . Where would he go ? . Where are you going , soldier ? . - Circuit maintenance , sir . - Has this area been checked ? . I 've been right through it , sir . Nothing . - All right , come with me , we 're searching the next level . - Right , sir . You adjust the temperature with this . You all set ? . Well , uh ... - All right ? . - Yeah . Look for the lights . Here they are . Good . Heaters . I see them . That 's better . Now all we have to do is find the device . Right . - There 's nothing here . - Well , keep looking . - Grant . - Yeah ? . There 's a relay cable here . I 'm going to follow it . The cable goes down under here so it must be under this section . Solid ice . Get the axe . It 's no good ... we 're not going to get into this way . If we stand here talking , we certainly won 't . Get a space heater started . I 'll put a lance into it . There 's mercury in that detonator . You burn your way in , you could trigger it . I know , but we don 't have time for it to thaw . Get started . - The rocket . That 's the key to it . - Yes . I have men posted at the silo . He may try and get in some other way . Through the launch doors , perhaps . - I think I 'll take a look . - Well , you better take somebody with you . There might be Federation guards on the loose . Ralli , find somebody . Right . Blake . Any news from Avon ? . - They 're down safely , that 's all we 've heard . - Call me if they come through with anything . - Confirmed . - Whenever you 're ready . Thank you . Cauder , if there 's still no news from Avon when that countdown goes below 50 , I 'm pulling out . I understand . To stay with us would be a stupid gesture . - I can take some of you off with me . - No , not for me . I 'll stay here till the end . - Ralli can go if she likes . - No , I 'll stay . All right , think about it . There 's still time . [ THERMAL LANCE ] Careful , you 'll trigger it . Done it . Get that table under the light . [ RUMBLING AND CRACKING ] What 's happening ? . The main roof beam 's cracked ... resting on the ice . If it melts any more , it 'll cave in . Give me a hand . Well , while it 's ticking we 're all right . We 're going to have to take out the relays to get at the activator . Get the cutters . Which one is it first ? . Left , right , or centre ? . - Centre first . - Cutters . - Which next ? . - Right next . No , no , wait I 'm opposite you now . Left is the next in sequence . Your left . - You don 't get another guess . - Left . Next bit 's straightforward . Do you want me to do it ? . Go ahead . [ RUMBLING AND GROANING ] Hadn 't we better turn the heaters off ? . It depends which you prefer : being crushed or frozen to death ? . These are some more Federation personnel files . Any use to you ? . Yes , I 'll check them . No . No . No . That 's Provine ! That 's his service record . That 's the man I got to go with Blake ! - Which way did they go ? . - The rocket silo . - I 've forgotten how to get there ! - The junctions of corridor 1 1 A , 5 1 B. 1 1 A , 5 1 B 5 A , 1 1 - 1 B ... - It 's getting cold again . - You turned the heaters off . Don 't let it tilt , keep it level . I must be getting old . Waste any more time and you won 't get any older . Give me the extractor . Now . There 's one thing I never understood . Why did you leave her alone ? . I had arranged to buy some exit visas , but I had to go right across the city to collect them . It was safer for Anna to stay out of sight . Separator . - What happened then ? . - There were patrols out everywhere looking for us I was late at the rendezvous . And then the man from who I was buying the visas increased the price . He wanted ten times what we had agreed . He said he could get even more if he turned me in and collected the Federation reward . - You should have killed him . - I did . Link clamp . So you got the visas . Why didn 't you go back for her ? . Killing the dealer wasn 't quite so straightforward . He was expecting something and fired first . I started back but I was losing a lot of blood . Somewhere along the way I passed out . I was lucky . Some people found me and got me under cover . You could have got a message to her , told her to get out . I was unconscious for more than thirty hours . I need to hold this flap back . Get your hand in here . That 's good . You can get at the main now . You used the visa and got out of the city . You left her there . That 's right . But that was a week later . Anna was already dead . You 're lying . You left the city the same day , before the Federation found Anna . You could have got her out . No . She came looking for me , the patrols found her . It was only after we got word that she was dead that I left . - You expect me to believe that ? . - Not particularly . But it happens to be the truth . If there had ever been a time when I could have given my own life to save her , I would have done it . The only grain of consolation that I have is that Anna knew that . She died because of you , that 's all that matters . There 's nothing changed between us . I didn 't really expect that it would be . That 's the primary isolated . My fingers are cramping . - Did you see the read-out ? . - I did . We 're running it fine . There 's a long way to go . - I said " there 's a long way to go . " - I heard . That 's one of the men Cauder sent to guard the rocket silo . Now where is the other one ? . [ GUNFIRE ] [ GUNFIRE ] Blake ! That 's Provine . We found his picture on his service record . He 's dying . Provine ! Provine ! The computer complex , Control , where have the Federation moved it to ? . Go to hell . You may still have a chance if I can get you to our surgical unit . Now where is Control , Provine ? . Star One . It 's called Star One now . Docholli . Cybersurgeon . Only Docholli knows . Where is Docholli ? . Where is Docholli ? ! . See you in hell . Sixty-three . Can we do it ? . - It 's still possible . - Blake said he 'd pull us out at fifty . - We won 't do it in that time . - Are you willing to chance it ? . That 's what these people are paying me for . Then give me your bracelet . Now he can 't pull us out , can he ? . Right . - This isn 't familiar to me . - It 's a new mark , but the principle is the same . There are three detonators , each activated by a plunger . If we enlarge these holes and then insert a rod , we can arrest the downward travel of each plunger . - A laser lance would be faster . - It 's too risky on this kind of material . [ CRASHING ICE ] I 'm through . Give me a rod . - Will it be strong enough to hold it ? . - It 'll do . - All right , release the trigger . - Ready ? . Let it go . One down , two to go . - Blake ! - What 's the countdown ? . - Fifty-three . - Liberator , this is Blake . Do you read me ? . - We hear you . - Any news from Avon ? . - There 's been no word at all . - All right . Teleport them up . We just dropped under the safety margin I gave him . - We can ' t . - What do you mean ? - We can ' t make teleport contact . - They must have taken their bracelets off . All right , remain on standby . We 'll stay down here a little longer . - Two down , only one to go . - What 's the countdown ? . Forty-one . I 've left it for you . Look out ! Grant ! Thirty-nine , thirty-eight , thirty-seven ... Blake . - Blake , go ! Leave us . - Blake ! - You all right ? . - It 's no use , Avon . You don ' t have the time . - Hell , it 's jammed . - Face it , Avon ; we 've lost the game . - Find your bracelet and tell them to teleport you out . - We 're not done yet . I think I can still get at it . I 'm going to have to crawl in over you . I 've told you you haven 't got time , get out ! - Cally , stop that , will you , please ? . - I 'm sorry . - What 's the countdown ? . - Twenty-five . It 's no use , Avon . It was a good try . Get out . You haven ' t got time . Nobody 's going to blame you . If the positions were reversed , if it were you under this beam , I might have left you ; the way things are between us . Why are you helping me ? . There 's one thing we 've forgotten . - What ? . - The last of the rods . I was holding it when the roof collapsed . - You did it . - Yes , I did , didn 't I ? . - Why did you help me ? . - Perhaps because Anna was your sister . - Goodbye , Jenna . - Goodbye . Goodbye Cally , goodbye Vila . And thank you . - Any time . - I 'll remember that . Oh , will you ? . - Right , Jenna , take us on manual . Get us out of here . - Right . Avon . You 're welcome to come with us if you want to . Thanks , but no . They still need me down on Albian . - Besides , I 've got a pretty hefty fee to collect . - You 've earned it . - Ready ? . - Yeah . Good luck . - Are you going to tell me about Anna ? . - You wouldn 't understand . - Wouldn 't I ? . - I doubt it .

 ( Woman ) ' This is a neutrino transmission . 'This is a neutrino transmission . 'Calling Moonbase Alpha by neutrino transmission . ' - Where from ? - Don 't know . But it 's no random transmission . They 're calling us . 'Moonbase Alpha by neutrino transmission . ' Yasko , identification . This is Moonbase Alpha . Identify . 'Moonbase Alpha . Moonbase Alpha . 'This is Space Station One , Texas City , Planet Earth . 'I repeat , this is Space Station One , 'Texas City , Planet Earth . 'Please stand by . ' Tony . Keep that channel open . ( Bleeping ) - They 've broken contact ! - Get ' em back . What about neutrino transmissions ? When we left Earth , the first experiments had just begun . They cover billions of miles in seconds . Could they have perfected it ? Yes . We 've been in space for months . - Which in Earth terms is decades . - Right . OK . OK ... So it could be Earth . ( Man ) ' Moonbase Alpha . Moonbase Alpha . Respond ! ' This is Commander John Koenig of Moonbase Alpha . 'Commander , this is Dr Charles Logan , 'Senior Space Scientist , Texas City . 'I think you will understand 'when I tell you that our year is 2120 AD . 'Please listen carefully . 'In 72 hours , a galactic eclipse will cut our communication channel . 'But in that time , if you can act quickly enough , 'we are capable of transferring you back to Earth . 'I repeat , a return to your own planet Earth is possible , 'IF you put yourselves completely in our hands . ' That 's fantastic ! Could be . If that 's really a transmission from Earth . In 72 hours , a constellation will begin to move between us and Earth . Communications will be impossible for almost a century . Standing by for construction details for the transference dome . 'Commander Koenig ? This is Logan . 'Is your science officer ready to receive our instructions 'for building the transference dome ? ' No , Dr Logan , she is not . 'Commander , we have time to make the transfer , 'but you must start construction work now . ' What was the name of the wife of the first man in space ? Hey . The natives are growing restless . Let 's hope Logan can calm them down . Right . 'The first man in space was Russian , Yuri Gagarin . He was unmarried . 'The first married man in space was Alan Shepard . May 5th , 1961 . 'His wife was Louise Shepard . ' Who won the World Series in 1998 ? 'I don 't need a computer for that . 'The 1998 world series was won 4-3 'by the Boston Red Sox against the St Louis Cardinals . 'This was the last time the Red Sox won the series , 'before all competitive sports were abandoned , in the year 2026 . 'Now , about the transference dome ? ' Forgive my caution , Doctor . Maya , as soon as you hear Dr Logan 's instructions , contact the Engineering Section and have construction started . - Wow-ee ! - Hey hey ! ( Buzzer ) Yeah , come in . - Progress ? - Mm-hmm . Oh , wow ! That is ... fantastic ! Well ... it 's pretty fantastic . It took me six months to reach this stage of perfection . How about a sample ? No , thanks . I 've tasted your last concoction . Com on , it 's not going to affect you . You 're right , Tony . No effect at all . All I wanted was an honest opinion . What does an alien know about beer , anyway ? Give me that ! Do you know your problem , Tony ? - No , what 's my problem , Maya ? - You 're prejudiced . Me , prejudiced ? Cos you look funny , come from the planet Psychon and turned into an eel the last time I put my arms around you ? - Prejudiced . - That 's not prejudice . - What IS it ? - Fascination . Now , how about a hand ? Maya . Everybody 's waiting in Command Centre to celebrate our return to Earth . Well , don 't just stand there . Come on ! Carla , we have 60 hours in which to indoctrinate the people of Alpha . The material is assembled , Dr Logan . I 'm ready to transmit . Mm . ( Carla ) ' Moonbase Alpha . Moonbase Alpha . 'This is Space Station One , Texas City , Planet Earth . 'Texas City is one of several metropolitan complexes 'which comprise the inhabited area of what you called the United States . 'You might like to see one or two of the others . 'Pacific City ... 'and Grand Metropolis . 'What you knew as Boston , New York , 'New Jersey , the whole Eastern Seaboard . 'You can see we 've come a long way . ' The cities are fantastic ! - What about the countryside ? - ' Nobody lives there now . ' In any case , our personal telesensual systems can create the illusion of spring in the Rocky Mountains , fall in old New England , simply by the touch of a button . The pollution of the 21st century . It destroyed everything . 'Trees ... 'crops ... 'rivers . 'That 's why we built the metro complexes and retired to them . ' Now , of course , who needs nature ? ( All ) Who needs nature ? Well , um ... On an ascending scale of ten , I 'd say you 'd reached ... two ? - You 've got no taste , kid . - Before I tasted this , I had . - Pilot ! - Maya . Less than 30 hours to go , and Koenig insists we transfer test instruments first ! In his place , would you do any different ? The test package is assembled . Sensors in the antenna simulate blood pressure , respiration and body temperature . This is the heart of the system . With this recorder , we can follow the readings all the way to Earth . Dr Logan ... test package in position . - It 's all yours . - ' Thank you , Commander . ' Transfer procedure green . Neutron factor green . All charges green . Reception area . ( Carla ) Halation begins . ( Beeping ) Begin monitoring . Heart rate normal , body temperature normal , - respiration normal . - Good . Now I expect a slight temperature drop , as the process begins . Heart and respiration should remain normal . 34 ... 33 ... 32 ... 31 ... ( Beeping ) 30 ... 29 ... 28 ... 27 ... 26 ... - What is it ? - Adverse weather conditions . - Freak storm activity ? - Worse . Commander Koenig ... We have seismic reports of small quakes in the Gulf of Mexico . In 1999 , our earthquake prediction systems were highly sophisticated . And even more sophisticated now , but this area of Central America is still too unstable for exact predictions . Could the small shocks affect your calculations ? - Of course . - Will you delay the transfer ? Why ? This is simply a test package . Temperature falling . - Heart , respiration , normal . - Good . Good . 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... - 7 ... - Interference zero . - 5 ... - Still zero . - Let 's go . - 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Moonbase Alpha , your test package is here with us on Earth . Readings ? Heart , respiration and temperature normal . Fantastic ! Chalk one up for our science ! Dr Logan , what 's the forecast on the quake activity ? There is no precise forecast , Commander . - ' Is there any risk ? ' - Yes . Whether you take it or not is up to you . How many can you transfer at one time ? 'Three . ' No precise quake forecast ? The whole transfer process could be affected . The earth tremor could distort the beam reflection . - Why don 't you old off for a while ? - Time , Tony . We have no time . Room for two more . You never know when you 'll need a doctor . Why should they go first ? Why , do you want to take the risk ? They said three . You told me heroes were fools with talent for nothing else . Mm-hm . Sorry , Tony . You 're in command of Alpha now . Let 's go . Good luck . You know , this stuff doesn 't taste so bad after all . Ladies and gentlemen , this is no longer just an experiment . We have , at last , escaped from the laboratory . 'Respiration , heart , temperature rates ? ' A-OK . # Fly me from the moon at last ... # Let Alpha be my long-lost past # - Ready to go , John ? - You call the signals , Tony . Dr Logan , take good care of them . Dr Russell - heart and respiration normal . Temperature falling . 98.1 , 97.1 . Commander Koenig , Alan Carter - similar temperature drops . 96.3 . 9 , 8 ... 7 , 6 ... - High seismic activity . - Location ? - Gulf of Mexico . Closing . - 5 , 4 ... - 2 ... 1 ... - Abort ? Too late . ( Rumbling ) They 're not here , Alpha . Well , are they there ? ( Logan ) ' Are they still there ? ' 'They 've got to be there , Alpha . ' They 've gotta be there . Helena ! Helena ! Are you all right ? - Alan ? - Yeah . - What happened ? - Don 't know . - Where are we ? - Don 't know . Pushed our luck too far . Something went wrong . Rain . Trees . Well , at least it 's an atmosphere we can breathe . They said that ... everything between the cities was desert , wasteland . So wherever we are , we 're not on Earth . It 's a wonder we 're alive . Get that power line hooked up right away . Carla , check the main computer . ( Tony ) ' Dr Logan , what 's happening down there ? ' - Give us time . - Time ? ! What for ? ! Where are they , Doctor ? I want to know what 's happened . 'The equipment 's damaged , we don 't know how badly . ' We have a reading - Dr Russell - heart , respiration , temperature , normal , Commander Koenig normal . Tony ! Wherever they are , they 're alive ! We 're reading them . They 're somewhere in space . You 've got to find them ! ( Helena coughs ) You 'll need that yourself . We 'll all be warm if Alan ever starts that fire ! # Fire , fire , burn so bold # Can 't you see she 's feelin ' cold ? # Now you can see why I got drummed out of the boy scouts . - Will you tell me something ? - If you 'll stop singing . If we 're not on Earth , where are we ? We could be anywhere in the universe . - We 'll never get back . - We 'll get back . If you were Logan , what would you do ? Recreate the conditions that caused the error . Pinpoint our location . He 'd better not drag his feet . That eclipse takes place in less than 24 hours . He 'll have time to spare . Get that fire started , will you ? Hey , I got a suggestion . Let 's go find some shelter . All right . - Come on . - Oh , come on ! I can walk . ( Coughs ) ( Sneezes ) Bless you . It 's the damp air - you 're not used to it . Damp air . A cold ? Now , look , you 'd better stay away . After the germ-free environment of Alpha , we 've no resistance . A common cold could be as lethal as cholera or the black plague . You 're the doctor , Helena . There 's no immediate danger . It , um ... could develop into pneumonia . Logan 'll be recalculating . We 'll be on Earth before it gets that far . How 's that recalculation coming ? Too many variables . The computer 's acting up . Stay on it . - Logan here . - ( Man ) ' Yes , sir . ' I want seismic units to reproduce that last earthquake effect . - ' Yes , sir . ' - I 'm not sure we can detonate . I want it set up anyway . Alpha , any change ? Respiration , heart rate , temperature , all normal . ( Beeping ) Wait ! Normal , except for Dr Russell 's temperature . It 's rising . Rising ? It probably means ... infection . Dr Logan , you must find them . Fast ! I 'm doing everything I can . I have search teams scanning the desert . Earth 's desert is uninhabited . With that polluted air , they 'd be dead . I know , but I don 't want to overlook any possibility . - Animals . - I wonder what kind . Atmosphere , rain , birds , vegetation and animals . Chances are there 's gonna be some kind of intelligent life form , too . ( Bird call ) ( Coughs ) John , stay away ! How about checking your temperature ? It 's climbing . ( Roars ) ( Shouting ) ( Yelling ) We need help . We 're not gonna hurt you . We just need help . Help us . Helena ! ( Koenig ) Helena ! - There must be a way . - We need time to reprogram . We don 't have time . Doctor , the computer is not acting . Moonbase Alpha , we have a problem . Well , how about that ( ! ) Join the tribe , Space Station One . Define , please . ( Logan ) ' We 've set up a seismic unit 'to simulate the identical Earth tremor conditions . ' - But ? - But our main computer is damaged . No time to repair and reprogram . 'Impossible to detonate . ' I think I can handle it from here , Tony . Hold on . We have an expert who thinks she can solve your problem . How heavy would the force be ? The explosives would give the equivalent of a force beta zero quake . At our rate of speed and distance , I can send a beam down in 30 seconds . ( Maya ) ' Can you clear a channel in your computer ? ' We can sure try . I 've cleared a channel , but I don 't know how long I can keep it locked . ( Maya ) ' I 'm matching up with you . Matched up . Ready to beam . Hope we don 't do a wipe-out . If you do , we 'll be the first to let you know . - Ready , Space Station One ? - As ready as we 'll ever be . Switch on for detonation Now ! Something 's coming up . - I 've got a location . - What is it ? - It 's calibrating now . - What is it ? According to this read-out , they 're somewhere on Earth ! No , that 's ... That 's ... That 's impossible . They 'd be dead if they were on Earth . Is it possible that your pollution didn 't affect everywhere on Earth ? That somewhere there 's a freak valley ? An air-bubble , almost ? 'Somewhere where they could breathe ? Not possible . We 've surveyed the whole of the Earth 's surface for experimental purposes . No . No , whatever planet they 're on , it can 't be Earth . We can do nothing but continue to recalculate and hope that we can do it in time . ( Maya ) ' If ... When you locate Commander Koenig , what happens ? 'He has no transference dome . ' Reverse magnetic field on projection pods on your transference dome and he can be returned to Alpha . How long ? How long have they got ? ( Maya ) In 18 hours , the eclipse will block out all communications . - There 'll never be another chance ? - Not in your lifetime . Look , I 'm sorry , everybody . I ... I haven 't been thinking the way I should . We still have time to send some of you back down to Earth . If anybody wants to try it . Look , you all heard what Maya said . There may not be another chance . I 'd rather stay on Alpha than end up somewhere in space . ( Man shouts ) - Easy . Easy . - John ... What 's a foot or two closer or further away in this place ? If we 're gonna get it , we 're all gonna get it . ( Koenig ) Anything ? - No , it 's at least six feet thick . - Check the door . - Helena , you look ... - Yeah , I look beautiful ( ! ) I look like a monster . I think you look great . - To another monster . - Thanks a lot ( ! ) John ... Check your temperature , please . 98.6 . Uh-huh . Normal . Yours ? Get those guards to understand we need some help ! Hey ! Hey ! ( Speaking foreign language ) - ( Pounding ) - ( Repeats ) ( Guards shout ) If we could just get your temperature down . It won 't matter in the long run . I 'm talking about in the next hour , not the next week . So am I. My guess ... is that it 's viral pneumonia . Pneumonia ? What 's the cure ? If we were on Alpha ... it would be so simple . - What is it , Helena ? - Is that a fungus ? ( Helena ) Scrape some of that off . - It could be . - Could be what ? Fungoids are the basis for the barmycin range of drugs , which were discovered just before we left Earth . It 's the only known cure for viral pneumonia . If it 's a variant of the same fungoid , how do you prepare the drug ? You need heat , any vegetable fibre ... and some of this . It 's rudimentary ... but it could stave it off ... until Dr Logan can recalculate his error . Heat . It means we 've gotta get out of this place on order to build a fire . No chance . Walls are solid rock , ten inches of seasoned timber in that door . Even if we were sure that is was safe to move her . OK , Helena . You 're the doctor . How many hours ? Six ... eight ... John ... if you don 't get out of here , you 'll be dead , too . ( Shouts ) - I think they 'd like us to stop . - Yeah . ( Shouts ) ( Speaks foreign language ) The fungus ! Look at the problem again , Doctor . You run your seismic reconstruction . On that basis , you recalculate it again and again . ( Logan ) And the answer 's the same each time . Earth ... But it isn 't POSSIBLE ! - Because they 're still alive . - ' Exactly . ' ( Thunder ) Enough ? Now the fungus . How 's that ? What is it , Helena ? ( Helena ) It 's the Moon ! Helena , we 've left the Moon . - The Moon ! - She 's delirious . - Let 's give her some of that . - It 's the Moon , John . Moon ... Here , have some of this . It 's the Moon ! It 's a moon , Helena , but it 's not our moon . This planet could have six or seven moons . It 's the Moon . ( Carter ) Hey , that mountain could almost be Copernicus . ( Koenig ) And the Mare Imbrium above it . It 's our Moon , Alan . If that 's the Moon , then this is the Earth , after all . The life forms we 've seen don 't just coincidentally resemble us . Right . It can 't be . It broke away . The Moon broke out of the Earth 's orbit . In 1999 . Then this is the Earth . Before the Moon broke away . We may be hundreds of years back in time . The possibility that they landed on a planet with breathable atmosphere - are one in a billion . - You think they 're on Earth ? The probability they 're alive elsewhere is almost unacceptable . Then why can 't Logan find them ? Perhaps he 's searching in the wrong time . I can 't accept that they 're on Earth in some time in the distant past . ( Maya ) ' Or the future . ' Look , you know they can 't live on Earth in the present conditions . And we know that they are still alive . So please , rethink your calculations . And remember , Dr Logan , we have only ten hours . If you 're wrong ... there 'll be no time for any recalculations . - I 'll take that risk , Doctor . - ' All right , we 'll go your way . ' OK . If this is Earth , where on Earth ? And when ? I 'd say we 're fairly far north . Yeah , the people seem European . Time for some more . How are you feeling ? Like ... I 'm coming back from the dead . It worked . Is your temperature down ? John , look . ( Koenig ) They 're switching on and off . Well , they can 't all be malfunctioning at the same time . It 's Alpha trying to make contact . ( Rustling ) If only we could communicate with them . So you 're the English fugitives who thought to cheat me of a fat ransom . - Keep it going . - What good will it do ? How can they tell us where they are , and at what point in time ? Keep signalling ! Let them know that we 're still searching . ( Chattering and laughing ) ( Woman cackles ) ( Scottish accent ) You 're gentlefolk , that 's clear . And worth a pretty penny in ransom to some great lord in England . But there 's one thing I still don 't understand . - How are you feeling ? - Rotten . My temperature 's up . Why do three English travel Scotland without armed escort ? You must know you 'd make fair hostages to any Scottish clan . Yes , um ... Explain that , Alan . Um ... Well , would you believe , we lost our way ? No , my friends . But I believe that one of you was running away - with the wife of an English lord . - Wait a minute . And that lord would pay much gold to get her back . No , it 's just not like that . Then why disguise yourselves in that strange garb ? The lady dressed in men 's clothes , speaking oddly . Alan . With the last flicker of that candle , the old year runs out . Drink that this new year will better it . ( Foreign language ) ( All respond ) - Here 's lookin ' at you . - Slainte . - Your language ? - Gaelic . Scotland 's language . I learned your tongue a quarter-century ago , to the year . As castellan for English prisoners , after our victory at Bannockburn . ( Speaks Gaelic ) Robert Bruce and Bannockburn ! ( All ) Robert Bruce ! Robert Bruce and Bannockburn . Bannockburn . When was it fought ? Bannockburn . I can 't remember . It 's a long while since I was at school . New Year 's Day , 25 years after Bannockburn . If we get that message to Maya , Logan 's computer will know . What plaything is this ? You too , m 'lady . Is the lady sick ? She has been . She needs some sleep . I ask you . Is the lady sick ? Give her some shelter where she can rest . Put guards on it , if you like . I understand now . The lady has the plague . ( Speaks Gaelic ) Burn them ! That 's why you were wandering the forest . Turned out to die . ( Continues in Gaelic ) ( Shouting and jeering ) ( Old woman ) Bring them ! Thirty minutes before the eclipse begins . I think we all have to accept that we have no hope of recovering them now . No , Doctor . We accept nothing until that eclipse actually takes place . ( Koenig ) It 's not the plague , she can be cured ! It 's not plague ! ( Old woman taunts and cackles ) ( Shouts ) Look , I tell you , it 's not the plague ! ( Gaelic ) ( Cackles ) It 's not the plague ! She can be cured ! ( Shouts orders ) It 's not the plague ! She can be cured ! Cured ? For the pestilence , there 's only one cure . ( Shots orders ) Helena , reach out to me as far as you can . A pretty ransom they 'd have fetched . Let 's just hope somebody ... on Alpha remembers their old training . ( Beeping ) We 're getting something on the indicators . Yasko , does that mean anything ? ( Yasko ) Just ... some sort of code . - Anybody ? Does anybody get that ? - Wait a minute ! It 's the old Morse code . - Morse code ? - An old form of signal . We learned it as astronaut cadets . Maya , the computer . ( Beeping continues ) ( Maya ) Scotland . The British Isles . Location established . Scotland . Carla , recalibrate . Scotland . Bannockburn plus 25 . Dr Logan , d 'you read me ? Bannockburn plus 25 . 1314 plus 25 ... 1339 . Scotland , 1339 . Transfer procedure green . Halation positive . ( Beeping ) ( Logan ) ' Texas City calling Moonbase Alpha . 'Texas City calling Moonbase Alpha . 'This is our final transmission . 'All channels will now close . ' Goodbye , Texas City . Thanks , anyway . Helena , we 're gonna toast your recovery . It 'll be short-lived if she has that . You 're starting that again . Alien ! Ah . John . Have a drink . On your scale of one to ten , where are you now ? Oh ... - Would you believe , still two ? - Oh , about five . No , thank you . You know your problem ? - No sense of adventure . - You 're not giving up ? Oh , no , no , no . He 's just going back to the drawing board . Pilot ! - Better ? - Mm . You know , when I think about all the events we could 've been part of , what rotten luck to have drawn Scotland in 1339 . Sure , we could have caught the massacre of Saint Bartholomew , Spanish Inquisition , retreat from Moscow , the sinking of the Titanic , storming of the Bastille ... - OK . - The London Blitz ... OK , you win . With a history like that , who wants to go back to Earth anyway ?

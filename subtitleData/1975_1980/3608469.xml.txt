YOU MEAN THIS THING IS PROPELLED BY SUNSHINE ? THIS CUP CATCHES THE RAYS OF THE SUN , CONVERTING ITS HEAT TO ELECTRICITY ... HERE . ELECTRICITY DOES THE REST , JUXTAPOSING FIELDS OF ENERGY , CREATING FRICTION . THE RESULT IS AN EVER-INCREASING SERIES OF REACTIONS THAT LIFTS , OR LITERALLY ROTATES , THE MACHINE OUT OF ONE TIME SPHERE INTO ANOTHER . THE CRUISING SPEED IS 2 YEARS PER MINUTE . YOU CAN GO INTO THE PAST OR FUTURE AT WILL . 2 YEARS PER MINUTE . ACCELERATION WILL KEEP THE MACHINE AND ITS OCCUPANT OUTSIDE ALL TIME SPHERES IN A CONSCIOUS , BUT VAPORIZED STATE . HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHICH DIRECTION YOU JOURNEY ? IF YOU ROTATE TO THE WEST , YOU GAIN YESTERDAYS , TO THE EAST , YOU ACCUMULATE TOMORROWS . BALDERDASH . IF YOU GO NORTH , YOU GET TO GLASGOW . THE MACHINE IS DESIGNED WITH SEVERAL SAFETY FEATURES . THE REVERSAL ROTATION LOCK AUTOMATICALLY RETURNS THE MACHINE TO ITS STARTING DATE AFTER THE COMPLETION OF A VOYAGE . IF THE OCCUPANT IS INJURED DURING THE COURSE OF A FLIGHT , THE PASSENGER IS RETURNED TO THE POINT OF DEPARTURE . UNLESS ... HE USES THIS KEY TO COUNTERMAND THE DEVICE .

MANKIND HAS NOT CHANGED FOR 2,000 YEARS . WE HUNT . WE 'RE HUNTED . THAT 'S HOW IT IS . THAT 'S HOW IT SHALL ALWAYS BE . THE FUTURE WILL PROVE YOU WRONG . THE FUTURE WILL TELL . ANYWAY I HAVE JUST ONE QUESTION FOR MYSELF- - WHEN DO YOU LEAVE ? [ ALL LAUGH ] UH ... I 'M NOT SURE . McKay : HUMAN FRAILTY AT LAST .

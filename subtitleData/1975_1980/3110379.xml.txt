 Have you got any biscuits over there ? Here 's some cornbread . I am cold . - Still with us , Brett ? - Right . - Oh , I feel dead . - Anybody ever tell you you look dead ? Oh , yeah . Right ! I just forgot something , man . Before we dock , I think we ought to discuss the bonus situation . Brett and I , we think we deserve full shares . Mr Parker and I feel the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level . You get what you 're contracted for , like everybody else . Yes , but everybody else gets more than us . - Dallas , Mother wants to talk to you . Yeah , I saw it . Yellow light 's for my eyes only . OK , get dressed , huh ? Parker ? Can I finish my coffee ? It 's the only thing good on this ship . Morning , Mother . Right ? OK . Plug us in . Thank you . - Where is Earth ? - You should know . It 's not our system . Scan . I can 't believe this . Contact traffic control . This is commercial towing vehicle Nostromo , ... .. out of the Solomons , ... .. registration number 180924609 , ... .. calling Antarctica traffic control . Do you read me ? Over . Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo , out of the Solomons . Registration number 180924609 . - Nothing . - Keep trying . Calling Antarctica traffic control . Do you read me , Antarctica ? Over . I 've found it , just short of Zeta II Reticuli . We haven 't reached the outer rim yet . That 's hard to believe . What the hell are we doing out here ? Don 't know . What the hell are you talking about ? That 's not our system . I know that . Do you ever notice how they never come down here ? This is where the work is , right ? It 's the same reason we got a half share to their one . Our time is their time , that 's how they see it . Same old shit , man . I think I know why they don 't come down here . It 's because of you . You have no personality . You happen to be in my seat . - Can I have it ? - Yes . Of course . Sorry . What 's happening now , baby ? Well , ... some of you may have figured out we 're not home yet . We 're only halfway there . What ? Mother 's interrupted our journey course . Why ? She 's programmed to do that should certain conditions arise . They have . - Like what ? - It seems she has ... .. intercepted a transmission of unknown origin . - She got us up to check it out . - A transmission ? - Out here ? - Yeah . What kind of a transmission ? Acoustical beacon that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds . - SOS ? - I don 't know . Human ? - Unknown . - So what ? We are obligated under Section ... I hate to bring this up ... .. but this is a commercial ship , not a rescue ship . - Right . - It is not in my contract to do this duty . And what about the money ? If you give me some money , I 'd be happy to do it . Let 's go over the bonus situation . Can we just talk about that ? Let 's talk about the bonus problem . There is a clause which states , " Any systematised transmission ... .. indicating a possible intelligent origin must be investigated . " I want to go home and party . Parker , will you just listen to the man ? " On penalty of total forfeiture of shares . " No money . You got that ? Well , ... - .. yeah ! - We 're going in . Yeah . We 're going in , aren 't we ? Approaching orbital apogee . Equatorial orbit nailed . 9 , ... 8 seconds on descent . .. 5 , 4 , ... .. 3 , 2 , ... .. 1 . DOR 's in line . - How 's the status on the lifters ? - Give me an AC pressure reading . 48 seconds and counting . Prepare to disengage from platform . 20 seconds . 18 , ... 17 , ... .. 13 , ... .. 12 , ... .. 11 , 10 , ... .. 9 , 8 , 7 , ... .. 6 , ... .. 5 , ... .. 4 , ... .. 3 , ... .. 2 , ... .. 1 , lock ! Disengage . Clear . Money 's safe . Let 's take her down . Roll 92 degrees , port yaw . Prime the port . I 'm not getting anything . Turbulence . Locked and floating . If it drops any time now , we 'll catch it . Initial damping 's going off . Hold on , people , there 's going to be a little bump . What the hell was that ? Pressure drop . Must have lost a shield . Let 's go with it . I 'm still not getting anything . Yeah . Dropping off now . Still dropping . There we are , we 've got it . Take her down . Navigation lights on . 9 , 8 , ... .. 7 , 6 , ... .. 5 , 4 , ... .. 3 , ... .. 2 , ... .. 1 . Kill drive engines . What the hell happened ? - Somebody give me a straight answer ! - Is the hull breached ? - I don 't see anything . We still have pressure . Push the screen . Why ? Secondary load-sharing unit is out . Three of the four cells are gone . Is that it ? No , hold on . We can 't fix it out here anyway ... .. and we need to reroute a couple of these ducts . Dry-dock time . Dry-dock . Tell him to dry-dock ! We couldn 't fix it out here anyway . We 've got to reroute all these ducts . In order to do that , we 've got to dry-dock . What else ? Some fragments caked up . We 've got to clean it out and repressurise it . How long before we 're functional ? - Wh-wh-what ... ? - 17 hours , tell her . At least 25 hours . Get started on the panel . I 'll be right down . What the hell 's she coming down here for ? She 'd better stay the fuck out of my way . Any response yet ? No , absolutely nothing . Except the same transmission every 12 seconds . All the other channels are dead . Kick on the floods . We can 't go anywhere in this . No . Mother says the sun 's coming up in 20 minutes . How far are we from the transmission source ? Northeast . Just under 2,000 metres . Walking distance ? - Can you give me an atmospheric ? - Yes . It 's almost primordial . There 's inert nitrogen . High concentration of carbon dioxide crystals . Methane . I 'm working on the trace elements . Anything else ? Yes . There 's ... rock , lava base . Deep cold , well below the line . I 'll volunteer to be in the first group to go out . Yeah , that figures . You , too , Lambert . Swell . You 'd better break out the weapons . I can 't see a goddamn thing ! Ash , are you receiving ? Good contact on my board . Clear and free . Keep the line open . Let 's go . Hey , Ripley ! Hey , Ripley , I want to ask you a question ! If they find what they 're looking for , do we get full shares ? Don 't worry , Parker . Yeah , you 'll get whatever 's coming to you . I 'm not going to do any more work until we get this straightened out . Brett , ... .. you 're guaranteed by law to get a share . - What ? - Why don 't you just fuck off ? What ? What did you say , Rip ? If you have any trouble , I 'll be on the bridge . Hey , Ripley , come back here ! You son of a bitch ! What 's the matter ? Can 't see a goddamn thing . Quit griping . - I like griping . - Come on , knock it off . - How 's it going ? Oh , all right . Have you put that transmission through ECIU ? No . Mother hasn 't identified it yet . Do you mind if I give it a shot ? - Please do . Ash , can you see this ? Yes , I can . I 've never seen anything like it . It 's very bizarre . You said it . All right . Moving on to second ... position . What is it ? Let 's get outta here . We 've got this far . We must go on . We have to go on . Will you say that again ? Shit ! Ash , as you can see , it 's hard to describe . I 'm going back to the console . Dallas ! Come on down here . There 's something different here . I don 't know what it is , ... .. but if we can get up that wall , we can find out . Amazing . Alien life form . It looks like it 's been dead a long time . Fossilised . It looks like it 's grown out of the chair . Bones are bent outward . Like he exploded from inside . I wonder what happened to the rest of the crew . Let 's get the hell outta here ! Dallas ! Lambert ! Come on over here ! Come on . - What have you got ? - See what you make of this . Ash , ... .. that transmission . Mother 's deciphered part of it . - It doesn 't look like an SOS . - What is it , then ? Well , I ... It looks like a warning . - I 'm gonna go out after them . - What 's the point ? I mean , by the time it takes to get there , they 'll know ... .. if it 's a warning or not . Yes ? Are you OK down there ? - Can you see anything ? - I don 't know ... A cave . A cave of some sort , but I ... I don 't know , but it 's like the goddamn tropics in here . What the hell is this ? The pit is completely enclosed . And it 's full of ... .. leathery objects , like eggs or something . There 's a layer of mist covering the eggs that reacts when broken . Kane ! Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm OK . All right . I 'm OK , I just slipped . It appears to be completely sealed . Wait a minute , there 's movement . It seems to have life . Organic life . - Are you there , Ripley ? - I 'm right here . - OK , Ripley . I 'm at the inner lock hatch . - Right . Are you there , Ripley ? We 're clean , let us in . - What happened to Kane ? - Something has attached itself to him . - We need the infirmary . - What kind of thing ? An organism . Open the hatch ! If we let it in , the ship could be infected . You know the quarantine procedure . - 24 hours for decontamination . - He could die . Open the hatch . Listen to me . We break quarantine , we could all die . Could you open the goddamn hatch ? We have to get him inside ! No . I can 't do that , and if you were in my position ... - .. you 'd do the same . - Ripley , this is an order . - Open that hatch , do you hear me ? - Yes . Ripley , this is an order ! Do you hear me ? Yes . I read you . The answer is negative . Inner hatch open . My God . What the hell is that ? How is he ? How are we gonna get that off of him ? - How are we gonna get it off ? - Just a minute ! I 'll get some instruments . Right . Now , if I go for an incision ... I 'll try and remove one of the digitals from his face . You 're gonna do what ? Finger . I 'll try and get his finger off . I 'll get this cleating on there . - It 's tearing his scalp ! - I know ! It 's not coming off without tearing his face off with it . We 'll have to take a look at him inside . How come they don 't freeze him ? How come you guys don 't freeze him ? You can take your mask off . What 's it got down his throat ? I would suggest it 's feeding him oxygen . Paralyses him , puts him in a coma , ... .. then keeps him alive . What the hell is that ? - We 've got to get it off him . - Just a minute . Let 's not be too hasty . We don 't know anything about ... .. it . We 're assuming it 's feeding him oxygen . If we remove it , ... .. it could kill him . I 'll take that chance . Let 's cut it off him now . - You take responsibility ? - Yes , yes , I will . Now , get him out of there . Where do you want to do this ? We 'll make an incision just below the knuckle there . Stand by . Good God ! That crap 's going to eat through the hull . I think it 's going to eat through the goddamn hull . Come on ! What 's going on ? This way . - Next deck . There it is . Don 't get under it ! Looks like it 's stopping . Take a look at this , man . Brett , give me your pen . Give it to me , quick . Come on , come on ! Don 't get any on your arm . It 's stopped . I haven 't seen anything like that except ... .. molecular acid . It must be using it for blood . It 's got a wonderful defence mechanism . You don 't dare kill it . What about Kane ? Here 's your pen back . - What do we do now ? - Leave Kane to Ash . You get back to work . Oh ... What ... ? OK . Try it . Damn it . I felt sure that was it . Try it again . I feel like I 've been in this place a month . We shouldn 't have landed here in the first place . We shouldn 't have landed on this damn ball , I know that . The sooner we patch this thing up and get outta here , ... .. the sooner we can go home . This place gives me the creeps . It 's amazing . What is it ? I 'd say it 's um ... I don 't know yet . Do you want something ? Yes , I , uh ... A little talk . How 's Kane ? He 's holding . No changes . And , uh ... .. our guest ? Well , as I said , I 'm still collating , actually . But I have confirmed that he 's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides . He has a funny habit of shedding his cells and replacing them ... .. with polarised silicone , ... .. which gives him a prolonged resistance to adverse environmental conditions . Is that enough ? That 's plenty . What does it mean ? - Please don 't do that . Thank you . - I 'm sorry . Well , it 's an interesting combination of elements , ... .. making him a ... tough little son of a bitch . And you let him in . I was obeying a direct order , remember ? Ash , when Dallas and Kane are off the ship , ... .. I 'm Senior Officer . Oh , yes . I forgot . You also forgot the Science Division 's basic quarantine law . - No , that I didn 't forget . - Oh , I see . You just broke it . What would you have done with Kane ? Hm ? You knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here . Unfortunately , by breaking quarantine , you risk everybody 's life . Maybe I should have left him outside . Maybe I have jeopardised the rest of us , but it was a risk ... .. I was willing to take . It 's a pretty big risk ... .. for a Science Officer . It 's not exactly out of the manual , is it ? I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you . You do your job ... .. and let me do mine . Yes ? - Where 's Dallas ? - In the shuttle . - Dallas . - I think you should have a look at Kane . Why ? Something 's happened . - Serious ? - Interesting . Ripley , meet me in the infirmary . Where is it ? Well , I don 't know ! - I mean , we have to try and find it . - Let 's check it . Dallas , please be careful . Sorry . No , not in the corner ! Have one of these . Just in case . Kane ? Are you OK ? - I didn 't see it . Was it in the overhead ? - It was up there somewhere . My God . Cover the damn thing , will you ? That 's a reflex action . We 've got to have a look at this . Excuse me . - It seems dead enough . - Good , let 's get rid of it . Ripley , ... .. for God 's sake , this is the first time we 've encountered a species like this . It has to go back . - Lots of tests have to be made . - Ash , are you kidding ? This thing bled acid . Who knows what it will do when it 's dead ? I think it 's safe to assume it isn 't a zombie . Dallas , it has to go back . I 'd soon as not burn it at the stake , but you 're the Science Officer . - It 's your decision , Ash . - Dallas ! - I won 't change my mind ... - I 'm not trying to change your mind . I just want you to listen ... Will you listen ? - How can you leave that decision to him ? - I just run the ship . Anything scientific , Ash has the final word . - How does that happen ? - That 's what the company wants . Since when is that standard procedure ? Standard procedure is to do what they tell you to . Did you ever ship out with Ash before ? I went out five times with another Science Officer . They replaced him two days before we left Thedus with Ash . Hm ? - I don 't trust him . - I don 't trust anybody . - What 's happening with the repairs ? - They 're almost finished . - Why didn 't you tell me ? - There 's still some things to do . Like what ? We 're blind on B and C decks . The reserve power system 's blown ... Horseshit ! We can take off without that . We can . You think that 's a good idea ? Look , I just want to get the hell outta here . Dust in the intakes . Number two 's overheating . Spit on it for two minutes , for Christ sake ! We 're hot and we 're getting hotter . Engine room , red clip status . - One kilometre on ascension . - Engage artificial gravity . - Engaged . - I 'm altering the vector ... now . Inhibit CNG . Struts retract . Struts retracted . Walk in the park ! When we fix something , it stays fixed . - Don 't it , Brett , baby ? - Right ! We should freeze him . If he 's got a disease , why don 't we stop it there ? We can get to a doctor at home . Right . Whenever he says anything , you say " right " , Brett , you know ? Right . Parker , your staff just follows you around and says " right " ! Just like a parrot . Shape up ! What are you , some kind of parrot ? Right . Come on , knock it off ! - Kane 's gonna have to go into quarantine ! - Yes , and so are we . How about something to lower your spirits ? Thrill me , will you , please ? According to my calculations , based on time spent ... Just give me the short version . - How far to Earth ? - Ten months . - Oh , God . - Great . - Yes ? Dallas , I think you should see Kane . Has his condition changed ? - It 's simpler if you come . - We 're on our way . Right . How are you doing ? - Thank you . - How are you doing ? Terrific ! Next silly question ? Oh , thank you . Do you remember anything about the planet ? What 's the last thing you do remember ? I remember some ... .. horrible dream about smothering and ... Anyway , where are we ? - Right here ! - We 're on our way home ! Yeah . Back to the old freezerinos ! - I 've got to have something to eat first . - I need something to eat myself . One more meal before bedtime . I 'm buying ! Hey , that 's a break ! The first thing I 'm going to do when I get back is to get some decent food . I can dig it . I 've eaten worse food than this , ... .. but then I 've tasted better . You pound down the stuff like there 's no tomorrow . I 'd rather be eating something else , ... .. but right now , I 'm thinking food . You should know , you know what it 's made of . I don 't wanna talk about what it 's made of . I 'm eating this ! What 's the matter , man ? The food ain 't that bad , baby ! What 's wrong ? What ? What ? - This is serious . - Kane ! Get the spoon ! - Get it into his mouth ! - I 'm trying ! Oh , God ! Don 't touch it ! Don 't touch it ! - Dallas ! - Yeah . Anything ? No . You ? Nothing . - Did you see anything ? - No . Inner hatch sealed . Anybody want to say anything ? This is just an ordinary prod , ... like a cattle prod . It 's got a portable battery . It 's insulated from here to here . Just make damn sure nobody puts their hand on the end of it . It shouldn 't damage the little bastard ... .. unless its skin is thinner than ours . But ... it will give him a little incentive . Now we just have to find him . I 've taken care of that . I 've designed this tracking device . You set it to search for a moving object . So ... Its range is short , but within a certain distance , it gives off a signal . What does it key on ? Micro changes in air density . Gimme a demo . - You see ? - Again . Gotcha . Two teams . Ash , ... Lambert and I. Ripley , you take Parker and Brett . Anyone see this thing , you catch it in the net that Parker is holding . Parker , I don 't want any heroics out of you , OK ? Catch it , put it in the airlock , get rid of it . The channels are open on all decks . I want you to communicate and keep in touch at all times . Let 's go . I thought you fixed 12 module . We did . I don 't understand it . The circuits must have burned out . - What have we got here ? - Damn it , hold your light over here . Yeah , that 's it . I don 't know if this is going to work . - Put this in there . - Right . Check the insulation . Oh , shit ! According to this , it 's within five metres . Open the door . Micro changes in air density , my ass . It 's within five metres . Be careful . Hey , don 't creep up on me with that thing . You guys stick together . - Don 't fail me now ! - What ? Parker , Brett , it 's in this locker . In where ? Here , take it . I got it , I got it . Wait ! Are you ready , Parker ? When I say . All right , now ! Easy . - Don 't let him go ! - What the hell are you doing , man ? ! It 's the cat . Hey , look , now . We had to bag it . Now we might pick it up on the tracker again . - I 'll ... I 'll ... - Go on , get it ! You get him , and we 'll go on . Here , kitty ! Here , kitty , kitty . Kitty crap . Jones ! Jonesy ? Here , Jonesy ! Meow ! Meow ! Jonesy ? Here , kitty , kitty , kitty . Meow ! Here , Jonesy ! Jonesy ? Here , kitty , kitty . Kitty , kitty , kitty ! Jonesy ! Jonesy ! Kitty , kitty , kitty ! Jonesy ? Kitty , kitty ! Come on , Jonesy ! Come on , baby . That 's a kitty . Come on , baby ! That 's a kitty ! Come on ! Whatever it was , it was ... It was big . It sure took him into the air shaft . It disappeared into one of the cooling ducts . No question . It 's ... It 's using the air ducts to move around . Could he want Brett alive ? What ? - Could Brett be alive ? - No . I mean , I ... I don 't think so . Now , this air shaft may work to our advantage . It leads up to and comes out in the main air lock . There 's only one big opening along the way . We can cover that up and then we ... .. drive it into the air lock and zap it into outer space . The son of a bitch is huge ! I mean , it 's like a man . It 's big ! Kane 's son . Come on , Ash . The Science Department should be able to help . How can we drive it ? It 's adapted well to our atmosphere , considering its nutritional needs . But we don 't know about temperature . OK , temperature . What happens if we change it ? Let 's try it . Most animals retreat from fire . Fire , yeah . Parker , can you rig three or four incinerator units ? Give me about 20 minutes . I 'll do it . Who gets to go into the vent ? I do . No . You and Ash , ... .. take the main air lock . Parker , Lambert , ... .. cover up that maintenance opening , please . I 'm at the first junction . Dallas , I 'm right here . - Parker ? - Yeah . Lambert ? In position . I 'm trying to get a reading . - The air lock is open . - OK , Ripley . Ready . All right , I 've got a reading on you now . Open the hatch to the third junction . OK , I 'm through . - Ripley ? - Yes . Close all the hatches behind me . I 'm moving on . Dallas , hold on . I think I got it . Yes , I 've got it . Where ? It 's somewhere around the third junction . OK . Moving on . It is right around there . Dallas , you 're gonna have to be careful . All right . I 've reached ... .. the third junction and I 'm going down . What the hell 's the matter with that box ? Dallas . Hold your position for a minute . I ... I 've lost the signal ! What ? Are you sure ? Look around . Are you sure it 's not there ? It 's got to be around there . Check that out , Lambert . You maybe getting interference . Dallas , are you sure there 's no sign of it ? It is there . It 's gotta be around there ! Dallas ? I can 't believe this is happening . All right . Uh ... Am I clear , Lambert ? I wanna get the hell outta here . Oh , God ! It 's moving right towards you . Move ! Get out of there ! It 's coming towards you ! Move ! Dallas ! Move , Dallas ! Move , Dallas . Get out ! No ! Not that way ! The other way ! - Dallas ? - No . - Take it easy . Dallas ! We found this laying there . No blood . No Dallas . Nothing . I can 't hear anybody saying nothing around here ! I 'm thinking . Unless somebody has got a better idea , ... .. we 'll proceed with Dallas ' plan . What ? ! And end up like the others ? Oh , no . You 're out of your mind ! Have you got a better idea ? Yes . I say that we abandon this ship . We get the shuttle and get the hell out of here . We take our chances and hope somebody picks us up . Lambert , ... ssh . The shuttle won 't take four . Well , then , why don 't we draw straws ? I 'm not drawing any straws . I 'm for killing it now ! OK . Let 's talk about killing it . - It 's in the air shafts ... Will you listen to me , Parker ? Shut up ! Let 's hear it . - Let 's hear it . - It 's using the air shafts . - We don 't know that ... - That 's the only way ! We 'll move in pairs . We 'll go step by step and cut off every bulkhead and vent ... .. until we have it cornered , then we 'll blow it the fuck out into space . Is that acceptable to you ? If it means killing it , yeah . Obviously it means killing it . But we have to stick together . - How are our weapons ? - The weapons are fine . This one needs refuelling . Will you get it , please ? - Ash , go with him . - No , I can manage , Ash . Don 't follow me . Ash ! Any suggestions from you or Mother ? No . We 're still collating . You what ? You 're still collating ? I find that hard to believe . What would you like me to do ? Just what you 've been doing , Ash . Nothing . I 've got access to Mother now , ... .. and I 'll get my own answers , thank you . All right . There is an explanation for this , you know . I don 't wanna hear your goddamn explanation ! Parker . Lambert ? Ash . Open the door . Ash ! Will you open the door ? Let me by , Ash . What the hell are you doing ? Get her up ! Get her up , get her up ! It 's an android ! Jesus ! It 's a robot ! Ash is a goddamn robot . God ! Holy shit ! Help me get this fucking thing off ! Oh , Jesus . Oh , God . Oh , God . How come the company sent us a goddamn robot ? They must have wanted the alien for the Weapons Division . He 's been protecting it right along . Parker , will you plug it in ? Um ... I don 't know ... Because he may know how to kill it . Ash , can you hear me ? Ash ! Yes , I can hear you . What was your special order ? You read it . I thought it was clear . What was it ? Bring back life form , ... .. priority one . All other priorities rescinded . That damn company ! What about our lives , you son of a bitch ? ! I repeat , ... .. all other priorities rescinded . How do we kill it , Ash ? There 's got to be a way of killing it . - How do we do it ? - You can 't . Bullshit ! You still don 't understand what you 're dealing with , do you ? The perfect organism . Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility . You admire it . I admire its purity . A survivor , ... .. unclouded ... .. by conscience , remorse , ... .. or delusions of morality . Look . I 've heard enough of this and I 'm asking you to pull the plug . Last word . What ? I can 't lie to you about your chances , ... .. but ... .. you have my sympathies . We 're gonna blow up the ship . We 'll take our chances in the shuttle . - Blow up the ship . - Good . Come on . When we throw the switches , how long do we have ? - Ten minutes . - No bullshit . Or else we won 't need no rocket to fly through space . We 'll need coolant for the air support system . You two go down and get all the coolant you can carry . I 'll get the shuttle ready . I 'll give you about ... about seven minutes . Come back here , I 'll shut the switches off ... .. and we 'll blow this fucker off into space . - Ready ? - Take care of yourself . Seven minutes . Take it easy . Jones ? Jones ? OK , check the bottles . Jones ? - How are you doing ? - Fine . OK , go ahead . Jones ? Kitty , kitty , kitty ! Come here , Jones , come here . Jones ! Come here , boy . Come here ! - Nice kitty ! Jones ? - Jones ? Come here . Come here , sweetheart . Jones ! Jones . Jones . Jones . Jones ! Goddamn it . Now I 've got you . Come on , sweetheart . Nice kitty . Oh , my God . - Get out of the way ! - I can 't . Get out of the way ! It 's gonna kill us ! I can 't ! For Christ sake , get out of the way ! Lambert . Get of the way , Lambert ! - Parker ? Lambert ! Lambert ... Parker ... Parker ? Danger . The emergency destruct system is now activated . The ship will detonate in T minus ... .. ten minutes . The option to override automatic detonation expires in T minus ... .. five minutes . The option to override automatic detonation ... .. expires in T minus ... .. three minutes .

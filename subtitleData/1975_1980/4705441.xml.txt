 We 're not even sure that Lurgen was here . - Docholli had no reason to lie . - Some people don 't need a reason . T rue , but let us assume that the keeper of the secret is somewhere down there on the planet Goth , and that the keeper is a royal personage . Lurgen 's brain print is on a thong around a chief 's neck . That 's what Docholli said . Or he said it was Lurgen 's brain that was on a thong . That might not be the same thing . If you find the brain print , and consequently the location of Star One , what then ? . - Finish what we started . - Destroy it ? . Of course . And the entire Federation with it . Does that bother you suddenly ? . Star One is the automatic computer control centre for the entire Federation . - Get to the point , Avon . - That is the point . Through Star One we could control everything . The Federation could belong to us . - I could be President . - Ah . Or we can take it in turns . You ready to go , Vila ? . Why not ? . Now that would be worth the risks we 're taking . - Blake is afraid that power would corrupt him . - That sort of power would corrupt anyone . Which is why the location of Star One has been kept such a secret . T ravis could change all that , and I doubt if he has your scruples . Then the very least we can do is make sure that he doesn 't find the secret . - Now there is something that worries me . - Yes ? . How do we know that T ravis isn 't down there now ? . You don 't . But there are noxious gases . Anyone who lives above ground will die sooner or later from toxic lung infections . Also your eyes will be affected . So anyone who lives on Goth lives underground . - If he 's wise , he does . - And if he 's not , he 's dead . All right , put us down Cally . Down safe . Proceeding on bearing of 029 . - Hey , the air is a bit niffy . - Hmm , sulphur . Rots your lungs eventually . Marvellous , I can hardly wait . Main detectors report Federation pursuit ship , bearing 1 32 , course 276 , leaving the planet and entering orbit . - Put it on the main screen . - Affirmative . - Are we in range of its detectors ? . - Negative . - Plot us a course to intercept . - Affirmative . - You ' re not going to attack ? . - Don ' t you recognise it ? . THAT is T ravis ' ship . But if we leave here , we leave Blake and the others out of teleport range . This is our chance to finish off T ravis . He is at our mercy . - Perhaps , but you can 't just ... - Course for intercept , 073 . Speed , Standard by Four . Strike range in four minutes ten seconds . We 've got him cold . We 'll be there and back within ten minutes and T ravis will be dead . Steer 073 , Cally . - Avon , I 'm ... - ZERO-SEVEN-THREE ! All right . This time we have him . Zen put up the radiation flare shields , clear the neutron blasters for firing . Confirmed . Avon , I hope you know what you 're doing . Neutron blasters are cleared for firing . Can you think of a better way to stop T ravis finding Star One ? . Target will be within strike range in exactly two minutes . No indication that he 's seen us . Good . I have no objection to shooting him in the back . All right to visit , but I wouldn 't want to live here . Seems deserted , shame about that . Avon , teleport ! Avon , teleport ! Avon ! Where are you ? . [ SNEEZE ] Hah ! Avon , teleport now . Avon ! Avon ! - Why doesn 't he move ? . - How should I know ? . Just so long as he doesn 't . [ CODED COMMUNICATION ] What 's that ? . He 's transmitting . Who to ? . Who cares ? . Stand by . His detectors must warn him soon . We are going to get as near as we can , Cally . Goodbye , T ravis . [ NEUTRON BLASTERS ] Got him ! So much for T ravis . Mind you , you could hardly miss at that range . What did you want me to do ? . Give him a sporting chance ? . Zen , take us back into planetary orbit , Standard by Twelve . Avon ! Avon ! Liberator ! Liberator ! We 've solved one of Blake 's problems for him . Let us hope that he can handle the rest as easily . Coming into stationary orbit now . [ EXPLOSION ] Teleport now ! [ EXPLOSION ] What the hell happened ? . What happened to the others ? . - Let him drink this first . - Where are the others ? . The Goths have them . - How ? . - Ambush . - Are we going down to get them out ? . - I am . And where the hell were you ? . - We just got T ravis for you ! - What ? . How much further is it ? . - Move ! - All right , there 's no need to push . Fool , you do not amuse me as once you did . Gola , you frighten him . That is why all his tricks go wrong . Silence , witch . I could tell you better tricks . I could show you things in the future . You can show me nothing ! All that talks is your drug . In the end you will inhale too much and it will kill you . Nothing will kill me , I shall live forever . Tcha ! Kick that fool as you pass him . Possibly I might smile at his pain . - Travis , my friend . You 'll take wine ? . - Thank you , oh Charl . My sister here has all kinds of mind-bending potions if they are more to your liking . I see ... I see A man and a woman . The man is a fool , the woman is beautiful to behold . Here , in the Tents of Goth . You see ? . She is not of this world . - In there ! - All right ! You ! Where is Blake ? . - They haven 't got him . - Silence ! - You know these people ? . - Yes , oh Charl . They are enemies . Of myself , of Servalan , and also of Lurgen who mended your wound and took away the terrible pains . T ruly a magician , that Lurgen . Real magic , not foolery and potions . It 's a pity he 's gone from us . Without his cure , I would be wishing for death . You say these people are his enemies ? . They pursue him to kill him . - A beautiful woman ! And a fool . - Eh ? ! . These two I leave to your mercies , oh Charl . A beautiful woman , indeed she is so . We had to stop Travis getting to Star One first . Well now he is stopped . - IF he was on the pursuit ship . - It seemed a reasonable assumption . If I 'm not back in six hours , come down . Both of you . That 's a long time to stay in orbit . Stationary , we are an easy target . No one knows we 're here . Unless you 've alerted them . Put me down Cally . It 's them ! It 's that fool Vila and the girl , Jenna , they 're here . - What ? . Is Blake here ? . - No . Pursuit Ship Four , T ravis here . Reply . The Liberator has obviously destroyed it . Yes . Blake must be one step behind us . We know the keeper of the secret is on Goth . We know he is a royal person . Perhaps Blake knows that too . But which royal person ? . There is the Charl and there is his sister . - It has to be one of them . - But which one ? . You will soon know , and when you do , you could control the Federation , you and I. Don 't be ridiculous , T ravis . Look , Star One is the computer control centre . It controls the climate on more than two hundred worlds , communications , security , food production , it controls them all . It is the key to our very lives . Think of all that power . You can see why the Council themselves don 't know where Star One is . - In the wrong hands ... - Yes , but in the right hands ; yours and mine . Be very careful you don 't over-reach yourself , T ravis . There 'll come a time when such ideas seem unambitious . One day , Servalan ... Yes ? . What are you talking about , T ravis ? . I must alert the nearest Federation flotilla to attack the Liberator . I can 't do it from here on this thing . I 'll have to use your ship . The Liberator may pick you up . It 's a chance we 'll have to take unless you 're prepared to risk Blake getting to the secret before we do , well ? . All right . How long ? . - Three hours . - That long ? . You could have the secret by then , it has to be one of those two , the chief or his sister . Don 't you trust me ? . - No , of course not . - Then trust my ambition . - You will be the new keeper of the secret . - Yes . ... at the moment , ground bearing 1 20 . - Is he all right ? . - So far . - Main detectors report ship leaving planetary orbit . - Identify . It is a modified Class One Federation pursuit ship . - Grid reference ? . - Grid reference B-372 1 Modified Class One ... that must be Servalan . - Zen , have they detected us ? . - Negative . - Cally , set a course to intercept . - What ? . A course to intercept . - No . - Yes ! - If we leave here , we leave Blake alone again . - This is an ideal opportunity . Not this time . She will be out of range in one minute . We will never get her . All right , then . We 'll never get her . - Cally , listen . - NO ! Let me go , you dogs ! Let me fight you one by one . Hold it ! [ GUNFIRE ] I said leave him ! [ GUNFIRE ] Thank you , whoever you are . You are a friend . - Who are you ? . - My name is Rod . Greeting . - Greeting . - And what is that ? . Er ... nothing . You say that it is nothing , yet men fall . It is magic . You are for the Tents of Goth ? . Yes , when I can find the way . They are underground . So ! I will take you there . Your name ? . - Blake . - And who do you seek ? . The ones called Servalan and T ravis ? . They are your friends ? . - They are no friends of mine . - Nor mine . So ! I will help you defeat them . I like your machine ... but I will not kill you for it . You 've saved my life . My brother , he would kill you for it . That is the difference between us . Very beautiful . You know Lurgen has gone ? . - We do not mean him any harm . - Then why are you here ? . - We come to help the Federation . - The Federation means nothing to me . I live as my ancestors have lived . We are a warrior people . We fight to live and we live to fight . What can the Federation offer us but slavery ? . You are of Goth blood , I know it . Proud , fit mate for a warrior Charl . If you do not want Federation servitude , why do you harbour their lackeys ? . You talking about T ravis ? . He 's a refugee from the Federation . Where is Lurgen ? . If you wish to kill him , why should I , I who am his friend , who bless his name , why should I tell you where he is ? . - I 've told you , we mean him no harm . - You come from a spaceship . My guards capture you , or else by now you would have killed us . What are these ? . You , fool ! What are these ? . Just bracelets , Oh King . Do me a trick , Fool . - What ? . Now ? . - Now ! A trick ... I take this chain from about my neck and place it in my fist , like so it is gone ! The chain now travels up my right arm , across my chest , down my left arm and into my great king 's noble hand . Splendid ! Better than my own fool . Next time , I 'll kill you . He is jealous . He thinks you do not love him any longer and he feels badly about it . He 'll feel much worse if I send him below , eh Fool ? . - No ! Not below ! - Why not ? . I have a better fool now . Great Charl , Leader of the Goths , greatest and strongest warrior of all , have mercy on a fool that 's lost his magic ! Behave and maybe I will . Tara , what do you think of the girl ? . You think to take her to pair-bond . How do you know that ? . But you 're right . I need a line to follow me . I need sons , to kill my brother if he kills me first . He will try that , that is as certain as our eyes . If you say that once more , your head is forfeit ! I mean it , sister or not , if you say that once more ... I say , I say that he will kill , but he will die . - We will kill each other then ? . - That I do not know . Woman , you are addled with that stuff . Come , sit by me . You like that ? . Well , yes . It 's very nice , very nice indeed . Good . Zen , any sign of Federation pursuit ships on the main detectors ? . Negative . - Any activity whatever ? . - There is no activity on the main detectors . What about the extra-range detector ? . You know that puts a heavy drain on the energy banks . - Negative on the extra-range detector . - Satisfied ? . No . I think we 're in real danger , hanging around here in stationary orbit . - Stay here . Wait for me , I will be back . - All right . I will then take you to the tents . Wait for me . - Your name is what ? . - Jenna . - You are of what tribe ? . - I come from Earth . Earth ? . Then you must gain my approval , Earth-woman , or no pair-bond . You remember Lurgen , the man who made your brother well ? . He will speak for me . He had magic , certainly . He is one of the best cyber-surgeons in the whole of the Federation . - But he is no longer here . - Oh ? . - He is gone , far away . - Where ? . The vapour does not tell me that . Lurgen left behind him a secret , what does the vapour say about that ? . The keeper of the secret may not even know that he , or she , is the keeper . - And you are asking me who the keeper is ? . - Yes . And if I could tell you , what then ? . Ask for anything in the whole galaxy , and it is yours . It must be a very important secret , this thing you ask about . It is . Yes , you are very beautiful , I can see why my brother wishes to pair-bond with you . This secret , I am told , is on a person of royal blood . It hangs from the neck of such a person . Like the one I wear ? . Like the one my brother wears ? . Perhaps . - Well ? . - Yes . And you would like to look at it , eh ? . Yes , may I ? . - I can 't move my hand . - No . - Was that some of your magic ? . - Does it matter ? . You must have great powers . I do know a few of the mysteries handed down from the Lost Time . I can speak with my people of my own blood . Yes , you are very lovely . I think my brother will pair-bond with you . The vapour tells me how deeply he desires this . I don 't think you need the vapour to tell you that . You don 't want me to bond with him , do you ? . You would rather that I left Goth and never returned . Possibly . If I stay , you 're afraid that I might take some of your powers away . The vapour says that if you remain here , you may die . Once I know who the keeper is , I will go , I promise . Would you help me ? . Yes , I would help you to go , if I knew who the keeper was . Isn 't it you ? . You may touch the amulet now . I will not stop you . - There is nothing on it . - No . You are disappointed . I thought it might be you . - No . And now ? . - And now I have to stay . - Why is that ? . - You know why . There is only the chief . He is the only other person of royal blood . [ CACKLING LAUGHTER ] Wine ! Where is the girl ? . Ah ! There you are . Come and sit next to me Cheer me up , I feel low . This fool is not amusing me . Music ! So , you do not hate me now ? . - I have never hated you . - Ah ! That 's good . You 'll pair-bond with me whether you like it or not , you know . - It is an honour . - Ahhh . Good , more wine . You are truly a most remarkable man . Oh , I 'm sorry . It looks interesting . - Do not touch a Charl 's person . - I am sorry . Humility is good in a woman . [ MOANING ] - Who are you ? . - Go away . No , no , no . Look , I 'm not going to harm you . Who are you ? . Go away , leave me to die . Go away . LEAVE ME ! - Quiet ! You 'll bring the guards . - Not the guards ! Not the guards ! Then keep quiet . There ! I win ! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] - She let you win . - What ? . She is a superior-grade citizen of the Federation . Her IQ is very high . She let you win . - You are a friend of Lurgen 's , or I ... - What ? . I 'd send you down below . You lay a finger on me and the Federation battle fleets will blast you to ashes . You and all your tents . We are a long way under the ground . Do not be sure any bomb would reach us . There is not a hole deep enough for you to hide in . Silence ! I am Charl here . I do not wish your presence in my tent . Go . Very well , but I must speak to you alone , in one hour , in my tent . It would be wise for you to be there . - You will come to me . - Uh .. uh . What are you cackling at ? . She represents the Federation and you are afraid of her . - No I am not . - HE would not be afraid of her . - Shut up about him ! - Who is she talking about ? . Nobody . You didn 't let me win , did you ? . - Of course not . - Oh yes she did . - Vila ! - Eh ? . Be quiet ! - But she did ! She let you win . - What did you say ? . - Eh ? . - You said she let me win . No I didn 't . I didn 't say anything . - Vila , shut up ! - But I didn 't say anything . - Guards ! You are going down below . - But I said nothing . You do not insult the Charl of the Goths ... BELOW ! But I didn 't speak ! Honestly I didn 't , you 've got to believe me ! I said nothing ! - Gola , please ! - No , no . He must learn . Gola , don 't kill him ! - Please ! - We 'll see , we 'll see . But you don ' t understand , it 's all been a terrible mistake ! Put me down ! I didn 't say one word , really ! Come along , we know where you 've got to go . Come along . In you go . Behave ! I was behaving . Don 't leave me here . At least leave me a torch . I don 't like the dark . I like to see what I 'm scared of . - Vila . - Huh ? . Blake ! Shhh , quiet . Am I glad to see you . What are you doing here ? . - Is Jenna all right ? . - Only pair-bonding with the chief . - Good . - Come on , get me out . I can 't , not for a while . You 'll have to stay here for a bit . Marvellous . - Who 's that ? . - He seems harmless . He smells horrible . So would you if you 'd been here for as long as he has . Let 's not think about that . Tell me what 's going on up there , everything . - Where is T ravis ? . - I see you have the run of the place . - I am betrothed to the Charl and I have his protection . - I may still kill you . - I only have a minute . Where is T ravis ? . - Oh , he 'll be back . I think not . I think he already knows the location of Star One and he 's on his way there already . - Really ? . And who do you imagine told him ? . - The only person who knew . Lurgen . - Lurgen was gone before we arrived . - Was he ? . Are you sure ? . T ravis knows better than to trick me . I 've already told him he 's dead if he tries . With all that power at stake , do you think that he really cares ? . Jenna ! Where is Jenna ? . I may not kill you after all . A lifetime with Gola would be very educational for you . [ MUSIC AND DRUMMING ] I feel strange , dizzy . It must have been the wine . - The wine ? . Seems all right . - I must sit . - YOU gave her the wine . - No , no ! I saw you give it her . You gave her a potion . One of HER potions . - No ! I swear I did nothing . - Guards ! You are going down below . - Not below ! - ' Til I decide how you die . Get him out of here ! I did nothing ! I did nothing ! Are you all right , my love ? . Yes , I think so . I did not drink too much . Gola , please release Vila . - What ? . - He was telling the truth . Your fool tricked him by throwing his voice . You see how much he hates us . Oh , Gola , please , or else you will have no fool to entertain you . Guards , bring the other fool back up . Be well my love . Will she be well ? . - Oh yes . - Good . - Oh , I 'm sorry , it is forbidden . - No , no , please my love . [ MOCKING LAUGHTER ] It has to be Gola , it 's not his sister , so it has to be him . - No . - Shut up , will you . Who is he anyway ? . I don 't know . Look , I 'm going up there , soon . - What about me ? . - Shh , quiet ! No ! Don 't put me down there , please ! I didn 't put poison in her drink , I didn 't , I tell you . I didn 't put poison in her drink , I didn 't . - Hey ! What 's going on ? . - You 're free , orders of the Charl . Eh ? . You 're the new fool . If you aren 't funny , you 'll be back . Wonderful . I knew it would come to this in the end . Who is it ? . - It 's I , your fool . - Who ? . You 've forgotten . Never mind , we 'll all die and be forgotten down here . It 's a sad life , that of a fool . - He loves her ! - It 's quite good , quite good . A drink from your hand ? . He is the fool , not I. And now , for my next trick ... - I thought you were never coming . - My men are already in the tunnel . - You going up alone ? . - I have business with my brother . - Who is your brother ? . - Come . Drink , master . Water . [ DISTANT LAUGHTER ] I thought you said they 'd all be asleep . In this trick , the captive ring is liberated without breaking the rope . Watch closely , is there a break above ? . Or a Blake below ? . And , one , two , three . Splendid ! Your friend is a good fool . I will keep him here with me forever . Like you , eh , my sweet pair-bond partner ? . - Of course . - Tara , tell us the future . I 'm in a mood to know . Will I be happy with my sweet pair-bond partner ? . No . - What ? ! . - You will not have her . - You talk nonsense . - The vapour sees a duel of the blood . No ! - Yes , a duel of the Charls , tonight ! - How can that be ? . It is ! Leave the woman ! T ry your strength with a man . - Rod ! - Brother , I will not call you Charl . Then I shall make you . - Blake ! - Shhh ! Who is this ? . - This is my second . - I see , where 's my second ? . You , fool ! - What ? . I don ' t ... - And the Master of the Duel , you ! - It is written he will kill you . - You called him back , didn 't you ? . - Yes I did . - Why ? . Because you betray the tribe . You seek to take her to pair-bond and she is not of the Tents of Goth . The vapour has prophesied that if you take her to pair-bond , you will die by your brother 's hand . - I am not afraid of your vapour . - Hmm , we shall see . - That is Rod , Gola 's brother . Now if that 's his brother ... - I see what you mean . Now is not the right time . - He who lives be Charl . - He who lives be Charl . [ GONG ] The victory is mine . I am Charl here . - Vila ! - Your vapour lied . - Gola ! - Aaaaargh ... - No , it 's not him . - Then who is there left ? . Ask the true Charl , the greatest leader of them all . Who is he ? . He who was most magnificent , the greatest , truest Charl of the Tents of Goth . Your companion of the cells . - What , that old man ? . - Their father . They deposed him , and then quarrelled between themselves as to who should be the new Charl . Their father ? . That old man ? . Go now . Take this key and take the bracelets . Leave this place . Go ! All right . Come on . Ha ha ha ... Let us out . - Who is the keeper ? . - Leave him , let my master die in peace . - Who is the keeper ? . - I sing you of the Tents , my Master , Charl of the Goths , I sing you of the golden tents Where your fathers wait to greet you ... It 's gone , the brain print 's gone ! You seek the talisman the brain of the healer . The man with the eye patch took it . Travis ! Old man , old man , Lurgen , the healer , did he talk of Star One ? . Did he speak to you of anything ? . A fool knows everything and nothing . He 's dead ! I sing you of all the wise Charls , sing you of all that . Your life , your death , Brought honour to the tents ... That 's it then . Long live President T ravis . We might as well lock the door and stay where we are . Did he say anything to you Blake ? . He said , " A fool knows everything and nothing " . A fool knows everything and nothing . The location of Star One is at grid reference C-1 7320 in the eleventh sector . Eleventh sector ? . That must be in the middle of nowhere . Shut up . The location of Star One is at grid reference C-1 7320 in the eleventh sector . - Lurgen must have planted it in his brain . - A man with a sense of humour . A fool knows everything and nothing . Yes , that must have been the trigger phrase . The fool to keep a secret that Lurgen never wanted in the first place . All we have to do now is find it . - Blake , this is Cally . Do you read me Blake ? - Yes Cally , bring us up . Another few seconds and I would have left you , Blake . - Course for evasion Zen . - 1 89 , standard by ten . Jenna ! 1 89 , standard by ten , and on , with luck , to Star One .

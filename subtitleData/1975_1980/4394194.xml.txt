 - If I do make contact with it ... - It may decide to come back . - It can only come forward ... - Yes . It may well decide to bargain from here . - This room ? - Somewhere here ! You could be face to face with it , Steel ! Yes ! All right . But watch for it . I may not be able to help you . Please be careful . 'We wish to talk with you . 'We have something to say to you . 'Something important . 'Something important . 'Very important . ' 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' 'We wish to contact you . 'We wish to make contact with you as soon as possible . ' Us ? - They want to talk to us ? - It must be us ! No ! Not us . It 's heard us , Steel . It 's heard us . It 's coming to us . - It 's stopped . - Where ? It 's stopped somewhere . Now ? In the time we 're in ? No , in its own time . Almost . It 's ... The footbridge ! It 's on the footbridge . That 's the between point . That 's the halfway point . It 's moving again . Still in its own time ? No . It 's crossed over ... into ours . It 's coming , Steel . 'Be careful , Steel . ' I sent for you . I want to talk to you . So let 's talk , shall we ? I have something of importance I want to discuss with you - a deal . Well , a transaction . So , where are you ? I can 't very well discuss something if I can 't see you , can I ? You 're here , I know you 're here . So why not show yourself ? We 've seen you before , seen you as the darkness . So let 's see you now . Here , on the stairs if you like . Neutral ground . No ? All right , we 'll forget the whole thing . I 'm in no mood to play cat and mouse . As far as I 'm concerned , you 've gone . You never arrived . The deal is off . Come on , Sapphire , it 's not interested . Let 's not waste our time . Sapphire , wake up . It 's time to go . I said wake up . It 's not here . It 's not interested . If it is it 's ... not interested . - Come on . - It 's here . - What ? - I said it 's here . Where ? Here . Don 't play games with it . It 's inside my head , it 's inside my brain . And I can 't see you because it has my eyes . It 's watching you and listening to you through my eyes so please don 't try to trick it . It could take my eyes ... and my mind . It could snuff out my mind as easy as you could snuff out a candle . Steel ... I can 't see you . I 'm here . I understand what 's been said . - You asked it here . - I did , yes . It 's here so ask your questions . I don 't have any , just a proposal . One proposal . What is it ? The darkness thrives on resentment , am I right ? That 's right . It 's parasitic . Resentment is food and drink to it , blood and tissue . Right ? - These are questions . - No , they 're statements . - Am I right or not ? - You 're right to a degree . To a degree . I have something to offer . An original source of resentment . A real reason for resentment . It 's on offer but it can 't be bought cheaply . Describe the offer . Sorry , no . - Please , do as it says . - Then tell it not to try that . It 's either you negotiating or it . All right . - Well , my offer ? - It 's not interested . - No ? - It has a source of resentment . It 's happy with that . Then it has poor judgment , hasn 't it ? Or blind faith . I mean , what has it got ? The spirit of a soldier who died at the wrong time when his war was over . The ghosts of three young men who were trapped in a submarine ... and some lost soul of a pilot who risked his life flying a deathtrap . You call that resentment ? ! There are others . Many of them . Yes ? I expect they are all third-rate grievances as well . - Steel ... - No . - Don 't make it angry ! - By telling it the truth ? Please . I can 't see you , Steel . Come back to me . - Where are you ? - I 'm here . Please take my hands . Please , Steel . I 'm frightened . Come . Thank you . Tell it , Sapphire ! Tell it what I 'm offering could give it enough negative energy , enough resentment , to last for 500 years ! - It wants to know . - I 'll tell it , but not here . Not 12 days out of time . Tell it to take us all back to where we were and I 'll explain my offer . - Every detail of it ? - Only if it takes us back . - It will take you back . - No . All of us or none of us . - It agrees . - Good . W-When do we go back ? Soon . It will go back , it will meet us where we were . Sapphire ? - You said it had gone . - It has . This way . - Does it matter where we are ? - Yes . I want it on the footbridge . On your feet , Mr Tully . We don 't have very much time . But I saw it . Something came through here . - I asked you to rest . - I saw ! - Did you rest ? - Not really , no . Fine . - Why the footbridge ? - What ? - Why the footbridge ? - You said it was a between point . For anything that wants to cross time . - Well , we 're crossing time . - We 're what ? No , Steel ! No , Steel , we 're being taken back . That 's what I don 't like - not being responsible for my own actions . - Could we hurry ? - I negotiated this deal . The deal still stands ... except for one amended clause . You can 't play tricks with the darkness . - I realise that . - Would someone tell ... Yes ... I 'll tell you . We 're going back 12 days . Well , not exactly 12 . 11 . It means that you will lose one day of your life but you can afford that . - Steel ? - It 's easy . - Easy ? ! - For you . - What I did just now was dangerous ! - Exactly . That 's why I want to be one day ahead of the darkness . You can hold time for a day , can 't you ? - Yes . - Well , then . While we 're being taken back 12 days , we 'll jump off at 11 . Jump off ? If you 're in an elevator and there 's somebody on the ground floor you 're not sure of , what do you do ? - Get off on the floor above . - And ? - You walk the rest . - Exactly . You must do it , Sapphire . I won 't trick it any more , I promise . It 's only one day out of 12 . All right . Mr Tully . You 'll be all right , Mr Tully . - You promise ? - I promise . - If I can be of any ... - Take my hand . 'Stillness . 'Mark ... '11 ... 'ten ... 'nine ... 'eight ... 'seven ... 'six ... 'five ... 'four ... 'three ... 'two ... ' 'Now , Sapphire . Now ! ' - One day ? - 22.736 hours . Well , that 's close enough . Look . - Tully . - Yes . Go back up on the footbridge . Wait there . - Wait there ? - Yes , where we were . And keep watch . - Of the platform ? - Of the platform . You still need me , then ? Oh , yes , we need you . Ah . Steel . And we thought you 'd gone . Us ? No ... but we will leave , unlike you . You 'll never go . You 'll never leave this place . - Oh , we 're going . - When ? Soon . We 're all here now . We 'll be going soon . Where ? Exactly where will you be going ? We 're gonna live again . We are . - That 's what it 's told you ? - Yes . To live where ? How ? - To live your own lives again ? - No . - New lives ! Is that its promise ? - In a way , yes . - Tell him , Sapphire . - It can 't be done . It can 't be done because of the nature of the power that 's using you . It thrives on the resentment of the dead . So what use would you be to it alive ? Once the others have arrived , it 'll start at the beginning again with you . - Me ? - Yes , you . You will arrive here again and will start to wait for the others . It 's like a loop , a circle . It is feeding on you so it cannot let you go . Forever , Pearce . You 'll never see those green fields or summer days . Forever . The same motions , the same actions , same circle . Oh , no ... And when they pull this place down and build something new , you 'll still be here . Walking up and down , whistling your songs . Waiting forever and ever . It can 't be like that . We were promised . - Sorry . - We were ! I mean , I 'd rather ... What ? I 'd rather go back . Go back for good an ' all . Well , we all would . No ... No , not this place . - Not for always . No . - I can make sure . - What ? - That you go back . - All of us ? - Yes . - But it won 't let us . - Oh , it will . You leave it to me . 'Sapphire ? ' It 's all right . There are no tricks , the deal still stands . The transaction ... Your negotiable goods are on the platform , we 've brought ours with us . For exchange of all of your dead we give you ... one of the living . Someone who is due to die in approximately five years ' time . The time of death is not estimated , it is known . It is recorded . Take him now and you will have the amount of resentment I promised you . Not from him , he doesn 't matter , but from time itself . You will have damaged time , perhaps even future history ! And that could cause havoc in high places . Is it a deal ? Your ghosts , who remain dead , for one living subject who isn 't due to die for approximately five years . Well ? Well ? - Not Tully . - Yes . - But I promised . - It has to be . It 's gone . They 've all gone ! Now for our part of the deal . Steel ... Yes ? I wondered how we were doing . We 're doing fine . You just wait up there ... where I told you to wait . Right . We 'll be leaving soon . Do I need to collect my things ? I 'll let you know . Winning , are we ? Yes . - They have all gone ? - Yes . You sense nothing any more ? No . There 's only that . That 's all that 's left . It 's a pasqueflower . They only bloom at Eastertide . - But it 's late October . - I know . - I think you said it once . - I said what once ? There must be something wrong with a ghost that has feelings .

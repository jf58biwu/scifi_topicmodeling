 Two planets ... We 'll be in range to survey the left-hand planet in 24 hours . Too distant for visual analysis but the spectrograph looks promising . Two planets . Be nice to have a choice . 'Dione , the council has decided , unanimously . 'We strike . 'We strike first before the travelling moon gets any closer . ' Excellent . We 've waited a long time for this . Here we are , John . The data on the left-hand planet . It 's inhabited . Paul , begin contact procedure . 'The moon is approaching strike position . ' Perfect , I want Satazius programmed for immediate launch . 'Your crew is aboard and waiting , Dione . 'This may be our last chance . 'You must not fail . ' - Dione . - Dione . We 've picked up a signal from the travelling moon , Dione . Ignore it . Touchdown and assault will be as planned . Stand by for launching . Launch . Satazius on course for the moon . - Check . - Check . Those two planets revolve round the sun , always on opposing sides . And the remarkable thing is that neither planet is visible to the other . Commander , powered object approaching . It 's a ship . Battleship size ! A colossus . Activate defence screens . Put all Eagles on launch pads . Red alert ! Defence systems activated , Commander . Good . Dione , they 've activated their defence systems . Analyse them and keep monitoring . Any response from that ship yet ? No response at all . I 've tried all frequencies . Still no contact . Alan , I want every Eagle airborne as soon as possible . The last ones are going now , sir . I 'm just on my way . Keep spread out , but approach it together . Every Eagle to fire simultaneously . - Against that it 's our only hope . - Yes , sir . This isn 't quite your style , shoot first , ask questions later . We 've been asking , they don 't answer . Look at the size of it . It 's got enough firepower to blast us out of existence . Their purpose has got to be aggressive . If it 's not now , it soon will be . Are you suggesting we wait to find out ? No , Victor , I can 't risk it . Eagle 5 ready for liftoff . Eagle 5 , hold . 'Eagle 2 ready for liftoff . ' Eagle 2 , hold . Eagle 1 ready for liftoff . Hold , Eagle 1 . Alan , all Eagles ready for liftoff . 'Thanks , Paul . ' on alert , move into attack positions . Neutralise all Eagles . Eagle 1 to all Eagles , after liftoff centre on me above beacon four . Eagle 1 to Base , I have no liftoff . What 's going on ? - They can 't get liftoff . - Try automatic . Base to Eagle 1 , stand by for controlled liftoff . No go . All systems check . All the dual systems check . 'All the safety cut-outs are functioning correctly . ' Trying again , Alan . 'Eagle 2 to Base , I have no liftoff . ' Eagle 2 , stand by for controlled liftoff . 'Eagle 5 to Base , I have no liftoff . ' Base to all Eagles , stand by for controlled liftoff . No go , we can 't get them off . It 's impossible . All the Eagles ? What the hell is going on ? Attack force Eagles now out of action . - Computer breakdown on that ship . - Coming through , Commander . Gyro-magnetic ratio has an anomalous factor two applied to electron spin . The Landay g-factor expresses ... That 's not what I want . Gyro-magnetic ratio has ... Computer 's going haywire . Eagle 1 to Base , I 've still no liftoff ! Alan , we 're getting some interference . It 's affecting Computer . Some kind of ultrasonic magnetic distortion . Coming into range of moon defensive screens . Deactivate . Commander , our defensive screens have been deactivated . Fluctuating power loss . Communication systems also down . Eagle 1 to Base , I do not read you . I do not read you . Come in , Base ! 'Eagle 1 to Base , you must ... ' - Paul , can you raise Alan ? - It 's out of my control . I need emergency power in the Medical unit . - Paul , switch to emergency power . - Yes , sir . It seems to be slowing down . - Do you think they 're going to land ? - Could be . Paul , are the communications functioning yet ? No , sir . - Kano , how 's the computer ? - Malfunctioning , sir . - Sandra , any change on the screens ? - Negative , Commander . Holy cow ... Activate scanners . No sign of enemy activity . Activate missile launcher . Lock on target . Everyone down ! Weapons ranged and ready to fire . Stand by . It wasn 't aimed at us . They were firing over us . It 's bombarding the right-hand planet . No response from the Deltan planet yet . They will . And the moment they do , pinpoint their firing positions . That ship comes from the planet on the left , lands on the moon and attacks the second planet , the one on the right . Mm . Those two planets are on opposite sides of their sun . They can 't see each other or fire at each other directly because any missile would be drawn into the sun . So our arrival has provided them with a ready-made gun platform , right ? Yeah . What the hell have we got ourselves into ? Dione , missiles from Delta . Track them . Commander ! Missile attack ! - Planet on the right ! - Trajectory ? Delta missiles on random trajectory . The Deltans have not located our position . Perfect . Stand by to fire . Paul , all non-essential personnel to deep shelters . All non-essential personnel to the deep shelters . All Eagles to bunkers . And you three get down ! Missiles , range 492 . Deltan missile zeroing in at range 264 . Paul , check for damage . 'Eagle 1 to Base , do you read me ? ' Base to Eagle 1 , we read you . Come in , Eagle 1 . 'Are you all right ? ' All OK . The shooting match is over , eh ? Seems to be , for the moment . See if he has liftoff . - Eagle 1 , prepare for liftoff . - Copy . Alan , go and take a look at that ship . 'Check for damage . Don 't get too close . - ' Any trouble , pull out . ' - Copy . I 'm circling the spaceship now . Looks pretty knocked out to me . No signs of life . Paul ! Get him out , quick ! Eagle 1 , pull out , Alan ! - ' Pull out ! ' - Copy . Paul , Sandra , try and make contact . Maybe we can get through now . Kano , test that capsule for any radiation . Yes , sir . It 's coming towards us . Yeah , I don 't like it . Probably some sort of escape craft . Are we gonna let them in ? How else can we find out what 's going on ? Could be dangerous . Yeah ... They didn 't fire their big guns at us when they had the chance . - Sandra , Paul , any contact ? - None , Commander . - Kano ? - No radiation hazard . All clear . OK , open the airlock to Launch Pad 10 . Keep Eagle 1 up there until that capsule 's inside the airlock . Also , I want three security guards on standby . Helena , Victor , let 's go . Security , three personnel to Launch Pad 10 . Stand ready . You ask sanctuary of us ? Not ask , Commander . Demand . Demand ? ! It 's your aggressive actions which have put this base in danger . No , you 've no rights here . Then I have nothing to say . All right . We 'll escort you back to your escape craft . Take her away . Wait ! Think , Commander ! I have already demonstrated the power of my ship . We have many ships . We could overwhelm you if you gave us cause . Maybe . But you won 't be around to see it . Take her away . Listen to me ! If you send me off this base you will destroy any chance of survival for your people . We want no part of this war . It 's too late , Commander . We used your moon to attack Delta . They will come here seeking revenge . If you want to live ... all of you ... you need my help . You give me no choice . I 'm glad you agree , Commander . Who are you ? My name is Dione , I 'm the commander of the gunship Satazius . My ship is now inoperable and I am the only survivor . Thank you for taking me in . I could only have lived for a short while . We did not intend to involve you . But you did , and now we 're in the middle of your war . We were concerned only with using this travelling moon . We calculated your approach and planned a strike against our enemies . We hoped it would be quick and decisive but somehow they anticipated our plans . They were ready for our attack . Enemies usually are . You would understand the problems of fighting from either side of our sun . We had no direct line to our targets . We had to have a base in space to bring massive firepower to bear . Many years ago we tried to use a passing asteroid . It was too small for our purposes . Many years ago ? How long have you been at war ? We have always been at war . What is it , Alan ? I could have sworn that ship was completely knocked out . Well , isn 't it ? That escape craft managed to get out OK . I don 't know . So there was one survivor , what 's so bad about that ? I don 't know . 'Commander . - ' Spaceship approaching . ' - ' Launch Eagles , sir ? ' Your Eagle will be no match for them ! The Deltan gunships have the same capability as ours . You must not get involved . Involved ? We are involved . Are you suggesting we do nothing ? I must take defensive positions . You must remain neutral . I would love to , but my idea of neutrality is not being a sitting duck . Your weapons are useless against that ship . You must do as I say . - Paul ? - ' Commander ? ' - Keep all Eagles on standby . - ' Yes , sir . ' Commander ? If you will allow me a communications link I will call up reinforcements to protect Alpha . What do you care about Alpha ? You send reinforcements , they send reinforcements . And where the hell are we ? In the middle . No , thank you , lady . It 's not our war . Everyone down ! Your turn next . Of course . Our people will destroy the enemy gunship . And then send reinforcements to continue ? Missiles from Betha ! They don 't have to miss by much to hit Alpha . - All right ? - Yes . How many are you on Alpha ? - About 300 . - Can your Eagles hold them all ? Just about . What are you getting at ? What is ... happening to you was never our intention . So you told me . I understand your anger . It 's natural you should blame me . I , er ... I would like ... to help you . How ? Get aboard the Eagles , if Alpha is hit they can fly to my planet . We 'd welcome ... all of you . You agree ? Missile launch from planet Betha . They 've destroyed the Deltan gunship . Direct hit . We 're back to square one . Dione 's gunship is knocked out and the enemy gunship is destroyed . Yes , end of round one . Now what are we going to do , sit and wait for round two ? No , I think we can be effective , finally . How ? By calling it a draw and negotiating a cease-fire . A cease-fire ? You said you wanted to help . A cease-fire would help us . And frankly , it would help you too . We don 't usually consider such a thing . But our plan for a quick victory relied on the element of surprise . We no longer have that advantage . Our plan has failed . I 'd have to consult my Supreme Command . I can arrange a link to put you in touch with both planets . Good . Kano , programme our communications system to link with both planets . Dione will give you the specifics . John , even if this doesn 't work it 'll be valuable to gain some time . Every hour Alpha 's moving further away , soon we 'll be no use to them . - How long ? - About four hours . Let 's keep them talking . 'This is Talos , 'Supreme Commander of the armed forces of the planet Delta . ' I am John Koenig , Commander of Moonbase Alpha . 'What do you have to communicate ? ' I 'm responsible for the people here . Through no fault of ours we have become involved in your war . If the fighting continues our lives are in jeopardy . I ask for a cease-fire . 'I appreciate your predicament . 'We did not start this war . 'We were attacked without warning . 'The enemy gunship on your moon had to be destroyed . ' Your gunship came here and was itself destroyed . Heavy losses must have been caused . You have had your revenge . I ask for a cease-fire . 'I will place your request before the Praesidium . ' At least we 're talking . Dione , contact your commander . 'I am Theia , Chief Commissioner of Bethan Defence . 'We are fighting a war . Please be brief . ' Commissioner Theia , I am John Koenig ... 'I know who you are . I 've been listening to your discussions 'with Commander Talos . ' Then you are aware I 'm asking for a cease-fire ? 'We have been accused of starting this war . We did not . 'It was started long before we struck the first blow . 'They were unreasonable . They have always been unreasonable . 'But we are reasonable people . 'You have asked for a cease-fire . We agree to a cease-fire . 'If Talos also agrees , then we can discuss the terms . ' 'Commander Koenig , we would agree to a cease-fire 'if it could be properly supervised . ' We can police the cease-fire . Because of our position here we can see both planets . We will give a warning if a ship is launched from either planet . - Is that acceptable ? - ' Not quite . 'The Bethans started the war , 'albeit they called it a pre-emptive strike . 'We want to launch a second gunship 'but we will hold it in orbit around our planet . ' You 're saying if the cease-fire breaks down , you want a military advantage ? 'Correct . ' I don 't believe Commissioner Theia will go along with that . 'As I have previously stated , we are reasonable people . ' 'You understand that should the Bethans launch a second gunship 'and you fail to inform us 'we will destroy Alpha . ' I understand . Commissioner Theia , do you agree ? 'We agree . ' You 've done it , John . Yeah , let 's hope it sticks . At least till we 're out of range . - Well done , I had my doubts . - Me too . Congratulations , Commander Koenig . Thank you for your help . It was in all our interests . I would like to renew my offer for your people to live on Betha . From what I 've seen here , you will like us . Our way of life is similar to yours . I made the offer at the height of the battle , it still stands . That 's very kind of you , but ... we will have to discuss it . If you 'll excuse us , Sandra will show you to her quarters . Certainly , Commander . Paul ? I want two guards with her at all times . Kano , instruct Computer she is to have no access throughout Alpha . If there is anything you need ... Thank you . Your computer , does it control access to and from these quarters ? Yes . Then I 'll need one of those . I am sorry , Commander 's orders were that you are to remain here . A prisoner ? No , normal security procedure . I see . Are you seriously considering her offer ? We can 't afford not to . We might never get a chance like this again . Seems they 're a lot like us ... in many ways . Betha will definitely support our life patterns , but even so I 'd like a reconnaissance . We have no time , Victor . We 've got an invitation from people like us to a planet like our own . We can 't ignore it . John , Alpha is intact and we 're moving out of range . If we commit ourselves there 's no turning back . And we 've only got her word that we 'd be welcome . - It 's a matter of trust . - Oh . Do we trust her ? Guards ! Commander , Dione , she 's gone ! Commander , look ! Looks as if we 've found Dione . Yeah . What 's she up to ? There 's only enough air in that thing for an hour or so . She 's making for the gunship . Why ? Everything 's prepared , Dione . Get me Commissioner Theia . 'Congratulations , at last we will rid ourselves of the Deltan enemy . 'Betha will be supreme ! 'Annihilate them , Dione . ' The Moonbase is trying to contact us . 'Dione ! We gave our word to supervise this cease-fire . 'What are you up to ? ' I 'm genuinely sorry , Commander , but my plan had to be carried out . This is war . 'We are fighting for our survival . 'You 're surprised ? Really , you shouldn 't be . ' - Your gunship was destroyed . - ' Part of my plan . 'After a near miss I detonated prepared charges . 'It worked , our enemies were deceived . ' As we were . But why ? ! 'It 's simple . We have an active gunship on your moon . 'It 's too late for them to get one here so again we have the advantage . ' And the truce , everything ... to gain time . All planned . 'All planned . 'Again , I 'm sorry , 'one does not behave ... nicely in times of war . ' All weapons ranged . Ready for firing . Firing ... now . Kano , get me through to Talos ! 'You have broken your word . ' Talos , we 've both been tricked ! We thought the gunship was knocked out but it was a ploy to gain time , to put you off your guard again . 'The cease-fire is ended , the gunship will be destroyed and Alpha too . ' Talos , I 'm responsible for the lives of innocent people . Believe me , I 've not broken my word . We 've both been deceived ! 'You are in a position to give me the exact position of the gunship . 'Give me its coordinates . ' 'You will cooperate . ' We must remain neutral . 'There can be no neutrality . 'The arrival of your moon has upset the military balance of our worlds . 'We will bombard your base until you either give us those coordinates , 'or the gunship is destroyed . 'The choice is yours . ' 'I heard Talos 's threat , Commander . 'Any attempt to do so and we will train our weapons on Alpha . 'And believe me , at this range your destruction is certain . ' Missiles from Delta . On target for Alpha . John ! The damage , the casualties ! We can 't take much more ! Dione , I 'm coming out there . 'Out ? - ' Out where ? ' - To your ship . I 'm coming out there now . 'Impossible ! ' I helped you , I took you in , you owe me the same option ! I 'm coming out there in a moon buggy , unarmed , alone . 'You would abandon your command ? Your people ? ' I didn 't say that ! What are you trying to say ? Hold it ! I 'm still in command here . Do as I say . Commander , you 're cracking up . I 'm coming out . Don 't do that ! They 've cut him off . Did you turn off the frequency ? Good . I had to make that look real . Tell Technical to stand by for instructions . Technical , stand by for instructions . All right , switch on the frequency . 'Cut me off again and I 'll blow your head off ! 'Dione , I 'm coming out ! ' Whether you wish to die on Alpha or the lunar surface is your choice . 'You will not be allowed on board . ' 'Dione , can you hear me ? ' 'Commander , go back . There 's no place for you here . ' 'Listen , if you stop the bombardment of Delta I 'll go back . ' You would have us give up our victory to preserve you and your base ? 'Yes , now , stop firing . ' Don 't you understand ? This is total war ! 'Then let me in . You owe it to me , Dione . ' Go back to Alpha , Commander . 'We will soon have destroyed all that remains of the Deltan defence . ' If you return to Alpha you might just survive . Dione , missile response from Delta . Commander , take cover ! 'Turn back ! ' Missiles from Delta . On target for Alpha ! How long before impact ? Minutes . 'Dione , I beg you , for the last time , stop firing ! ' Come on , hurry it ! Turn back ! You will not be allowed on board this ship . 'You only have yourself to blame . ' That moon vehicle , it 's a trap . Turn the guns on it , quick ! Destroy it ! It 's no use , Dione , the moon buggy is under the range of our guns . No ... Goodbye , Dione . NO ! Call Delta , tell them the Bethan gunship is destroyed . And signal Talos , tell him to destroy his missiles . Signal acknowledged . What a waste , total waste . Still , perhaps some good 'll come of it . Maybe now they 'll learn how to live together . We survived , John . Yes , Helena , but think of the cost . No further contact , sir . Evacuation procedure negative , sir . Situation ... normal . Well , we 've got five cases of middle ear damage . It 's not serious , there 's nothing permanent . We 're lucky . I wonder what life on Dione 's planet would have been like . You feeling regret ? No , no , just curious . I 'd rather take my chances wandering through space than be involved in a permanent war . Anyway , it 's too late now . Yeah , too late . They 've got their war and we have all of space in which to find a home . Somewhere .

 20 miles long by five miles wide . - 100 square miles of spaceship . - Signal decoded . Let 's hear it . 'Emergency , emergency , 'this is the commander of the spaceship Daria . 'A major catastrophe has occurred . 'Large areas of our ship are devastated . 'Thousands of our people are dead , hundreds sick and dying . 'We who survive will perish 'without urgent medical and material aid . 'Please help us . Our life-type 'conforms to 4-5-0-X-2-9-4-H . ' Kill it . Let 's see it close up . We 're picking up life-signs , Commander . - Maybe it 's not too late , Commander . - What do you think , John ? We 'll need a team . Paul , you 'll assess material damage . Helena , medical . Victor , scientific . Alan , put Eagle 1 on the pad for lift-off . Ann , Sandra , keep all communication systems wide open . Any response from that ship , relay it to us . Kano , you take over . ' .. Hundreds sick and dying . We who survive will ... ' There is no sign of a way in , Commander . Alan , there 's 50 miles of ship . Keep trying . We 're being drawn into the ship . All Eagle 's systems are smothered . See if you can break the hold . It 's no use . Eagle 1 calling Main Mission . Eagle 1 calling Main Mission , do you read me ? Eagle 1 ... Try internal . See if we can raise any of the people on this ship . Right . It 's useless . Well , we 're here . But can we get out again ? - Well ? - It 's all right . Won 't need those . We have breathable atmosphere and a power source somewhere . What happened to our communications ? Radiation distortion . Even our comlocks are affected . This ship is saturated with atomic radiation . - Radiation ? - Yeah , but it 's too weak to harm us . And ... Yes , life-signs are confirmed . There is life somewhere on this ship . Let 's find it . Well , here goes . These two corridors should lead to the main areas of the ship . Victor , you and I will take the one on the right . Paul , you and Alan will take the left . Helena , you and Ariel stay here by the Eagle . If we don 't make contact with the Darians , we 'll rendezvous here at 1600 hours . Now , let 's see if we can get out of this place . If there 's trouble , let 's hope the Darians understand our motives . Let 's go . We 're in for a long walk . Ship like this , the size of a city , ought to be worth it . That remains to be seen . - It 's getting worse . - Yes . Let 's see how far we can get . Bill . Look . - Is it a door ? - I think you 're right . I 'll try and move this . - We 'll never get through this . - Yeah . Right , let 's go back . Helena , shouldn 't we wait till the others come back ? We should . Let 's just take a look . Back . Are you ... Can you speak ? What is it ? What 's the matter ? Bill ! Reception committee ? Lowry ! Lowry ! Enough ! Take them away . Wait ! Wait , we came to help ! Please ! We came to help . Please , please ! Come on , there 's no one here . OK , now you were here when the others came , right ? What ... Which way ? There ? There ? Paul , this opening wasn 't here before . No . Will you show us ? We need your help . Please . We 'll protect you . Are you recovered ? Why did you attack us ? We came to help . You must understand that you 're strangers . We found you on our ship . We had to know whether you were hostile . Why the hell didn 't you ask ? We probed your mind and the mind of your friend . We know all there is to know about you and your people , Commander Koenig . Who are you ? Our people are called Darians . This was our world , Daria . I 'm Kara , Director of Reconstruction on this ship . Have you found the rest of my people ? Your friend Bergman is resting . We don 't know where the others are . We 'll find them , but it may take time . You must understand , Commander Koenig , that apart from this small area , our ship is a wilderness . - We picked up your signal . - That signal was triggered when all but one of our nuclear reactors exploded . It 's been transmitting ever since . - Ever since when ? - Ever since this disaster occurred , 900 years ago . Only this part of the ship was shielded . Out of 50,000 Darians , only 14 of us survived intact . 14 ? Not all died at once , of course . Thousands survived the explosions . But they were sick . Irradiated . And we came here to help . We 're far beyond the call for help that brought you here . But your presence here is vital to our survival . Mutant ! No , Paul . Leave him . Leave him . He 's done what we asked . He got us here . Come on . Help me ! No ! Help me ! Mutant ! - Destroy him ! - Kill him ! No ! No ! No . Clear ! Summon the spirits ! Welcome . I am Neman , Commander of this ship . - Have you found our people ? - Unfortunately , no . We 'd planned to rendezvous back at our ship . There 's no one there . It 's possible they are looking for you . - Believe me , we are doing our best . - And not succeeding . Commander , we are few . And see ... The ship is large . All right , I understand . Please , follow me . As Commander of the Alpha base on the moon , your people abide by your decision . Has it occurred to you how similar our situations are ? This ship , your moon . Both of us victims of an unfortunate disaster . We have that in common . You know this ship was virtually destroyed . You may recall a ship from Earth history . - You mean the Ark . - Yes . This ship has a similar function . To preserve the life and skills of our Darian race . You see , our planet Daria no longer exists . Is it not true that your planet Earth may too no longer exist ? It 's possible . So your community may be all that is left of Earth 's civilisation . That too is possible . But it 's a possibility that you dare not ignore . Maybe . But it 's also the incentive that spurs our will to survive . But will you survive ? You haven 't answered me , Koenig . Neman , we try not to anticipate the future . Our concerns are with the present . And for the present , yes , we survive . But for how long ? Your moon is lost . At the mercy of all the random forces of deep space . In time , your resources will give out , your people start to die . You will all perish . We have some way to go before we get to that point . Commander Koenig , we are coming to the end of a thousand-year voyage . Our main drive is undamaged . The ship is programmed to reach our destination - a virgin planet where the Darian civilisation can begin again . Don 't you understand ? We are offering your people a guarantee of survival . Join us . Share in the future on the new world that awaits our arrival . I know your concern for the rest of your party . I will personally supervise the search . In the meantime , please , consider our offer . Here in this sacred shrine of knowledge , we dedicate this perfect body . We pledge her in the spirit of true science . We pledge her in the light of clear knowledge and maintain that she is free of the mutant whom we abhor in all his manifestations . This we pledge on the sacred book of Neman , maker of man ! Father of spirits ! To you , Neman , we , the survivors of Level Seven , offer this body ! So that 's it . We throw in our lot with them and they let us share their new world . Victor , it 'll take them another hundred years to reach that planet . A hundred years . That 's a very long time . We certainly won 't be around to see it . No , but we could open up this ship . Start families , prepare our people for the future . It 's very tempting , John . After all , we can 't go on as we are indefinitely . It means abandoning Alpha , pooling our resources , and the question is , are we compatible ? Can we complete the voyage with the Darians ? All right , let 's test it . No . Please , no . On stun , you might hit her . - Alan ! - Let her go ! They killed Lowry ! Alan , look out ! Paul , help me ! And ... Thank you . I think I 've located the airlock mechanism . We should be able to fix it for controlled entry and exit . - Yeah ? Good . - What 's the matter ? Er ... I 'm not sure . We 've established that the Darians are as human as we are . Their food requirements are similar to ours . These are the components we use to provide our food on Alpha . They 're processed and recycled to make them palatable . These are the Darian requirements . You see a different system but same requirements . But now , look at their components . No basic proteins , no amino acids ... or trace elements . No enzyme variants . The Darians can 't support life on these . The Darian computer supplied the list and I checked it . There are no reserves of those elements anywhere on this ship . - You 've checked the recycling plant ? - Yes . All of those essential elements are present and being constantly renewed . If the Darians have no reserves on this ship ... Just a minute . I said there were no reserves of these elements on this ship . That 's not strictly correct . There is one source where they could find those elements . A human source . Bodies ? That 's it , John . Living human bodies . Defiler of truth ! Killer of spirit . Enemy of Neman ! Is it true ? Does it matter where we get those elements from ? - It matters . - We would have told you . You 're civilised people . Why ? To live . Doesn 't it also matter how you live ? Our experience on this ship has taught us the only truth - survival ! You can 't justify using the bodies of your own people to survive . Oh , no . Not our own people . How could we ? There are only fourteen true Darians on this ship . - The others . - What others ? They exist. out there in the radioactive wilderness . The descendants of the original survivors , left to die . It was twenty years before we knew they 'd survived . You can 't comprehend what we found . A million years of civilisation wiped clean in one generation . And what was left were ... degenerate creatures . Savage , mutant , - cannibal . - Why didn 't you help them ? They would have overwhelmed us . But we tried to help them survive . We taught them the rudiments of science , we gave them a god to believe in . You gave them a god ? A god who taught them to preserve only the fittest . The weak , the sick , the mutant , were ... Used as human fodder for your recycling plants ! It only became necessary after our own resources ran out . Don 't you see ? There were only fourteen of us . We had to survive ! You Darians value yourselves very highly . Do you think we did it so Neman and I and the other Darians could live ? - Well , didn 't you ? - No . There 's a greater survival . Come . I 'll show you what it is . Spirit , a sign . Forgive us . Spirit of knowledge , protect us . Spirit of Neman , preserve us . Don 't try it ! Spirit ! This is no spirit . Look ! They have deceived you ! He 's a man ! He 's a man like you ! He 's a man like me ! Tell them . Tell them , so help me , or I 'll throw you to them ! No , no please . Tell them ! - It is true . - Louder ! It is true . I am no spirit ! Let me go . Right . You know where the rest of my people are ? - Yes , yes . - You 'll take us to them ? Right . Now he will take us to the place of the false spirits . Who will follow ? Who of you will follow ? Our mission is to survive this voyage . Not for ourselves but for this . A gene bank , that contains the undamaged genetic material of our race . A double helix . The same basic genetic material of our species . Then you 'll realise how important it is to us . We managed to preserve it before radiation irreparably damaged our people . With it we can build up our race again . Pure , healthy Darians . That 's why we need you , John Koenig . You have the resources that we need to complete our voyage and save our race . You seem to have managed without us . Not for much longer . The mutant survivors are dying faster than they can replace themselves . Once they die , all life on this ship perishes . And with it a million years of civilisation . Join us , John Koenig . Put an end to this terrible thing we 've had to do . It will guarantee our survival and your future . We do nothing until we find the rest of my people . Paul ! - Commander ! - Professor . - Where are the others ? - They 've got Helena . - She 's around here somewhere . - Lowry ? - Lowry 's dead . - Carter ? I don 't know . We got separated back there . Helena has to be this way . Hey , you want to run away now you know the truth ? Well , come on . Move it . What is this ? You listen to me . We happen to know what you 've been doing to those people out there . Exploiting them , using them . That 's your problem and theirs . You Darians have one of our people . A woman . I want you to take us to her ... or we 'll tear this place apart . - What the hell have you done to her ? - Wait ! She 's reviving ! She 's not been harmed . She 'll be all right in about twelve hours . - Now what 's going on here ? - Transplant surgery . Ever since the catastrophe , we Darians have had to prolong life . By artificial means . You two , stay here . That 's how you prolong life ? Is there nothing you won 't do in the sacred name of survival ? We can 't reproduce ourselves ! What else could we do ? That 's the future you had in mind for us , wasn 't it ? To keep you Darians alive ! Was it ? Was it ? Yes . Think of it . All of you . Unlimited life . When the voyage ends , you will still be alive - and your future assured . - It 's not our way . We 'd prefer to take our chances in space . Do you think we wanted this ? You must believe me . Once our race has been established on the new planet , we , Kara , the rest of the Darians , will gladly die . Neman ! The survivors have broken in ! Hadin , no . - No ! - Neman . You are not a god . Stop it ! Listen to me . The only chance you have is to help each other and live together . The gene bank 's destroyed . A million years of civilisation gone . What future do we have now ? What future do you have now ? These people are your future now . Prepare them to survive in space . We 'll help you . The rest is up to you . You 're fine now . 'Nice to see your face again , Eagle 1 . What happened ? ' Remind me to tell you sometime . If the same thing happened on Alpha , would you have chosen differently ? Remind me to tell you sometime .

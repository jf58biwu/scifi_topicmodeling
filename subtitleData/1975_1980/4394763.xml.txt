 ( HORSE HOOVES CLOPPING ) Whoa , boy . Whoa , whoa . ( HUMMING ) Well , where have you been ? Why are you so late ? I sent for you weeks ago . I 'm sorry , I can 't quite ... Oh , I forgot my teeth . What on earth have I done with them ? Here . Here they are . I hate wearing them . - They 're not mine . They don 't fit . - GREG : Well , they do help . Not me , they don 't . Well , why are you so late ? - We didn 't know we were expected . - But I sent the message weeks ago , " Send me some help , Millar and McIntosh . " - Well , what are they doing to you ? - Who ? - Well , Millar and McIntosh . - They 're not doing anything . I sent them the message . When did they give it to you ? I 'm afraid they didn 't , we never met them . What is the problem ? Perhaps we can help . Oh , you can talk , can you ? I thought perhaps you were having trouble with your teeth , too . ( LAUGHS ) No , there 's nothing wrong with my teeth . Quite sure ? Sounds funny to me . - She 's Norwegian . - Oh , I see . From Norway . I 'm not stupid , you know , I know where Norwegian is . But I don 't want to know about your problems . What are you going to do about mine ? Oh , you want a new set of teeth . That is a marvellous idea . The next time I 'm attacked I 'll just bite them , eh ? - Dogs ? - You 're as bad as each other . Who 's attacking you ? I have been raided twice . Lucky to escape with my life , or worse . - And who by ? - Indians . Indians ? You mean , they were " Indian " Indians ? All the best people died , I always said so . Only the loonies survived . Red Indians . ( CHUCKLES ) You have been raided by Red Indians ? - Do I have to say it again ? - Well , it 's just that Red Indians would be a little out of their reservation , wouldn 't they ? Well , you hardly expect to find them around here . Well , you wouldn 't expect to find her around here , would you ? Red Indians . Whooping down all over the place . I 'm lucky to escape with my life , or worse . - Well , what did they do ? - They didn 't . I locked myself in a cupboard . - Oh , I 'm not stupid , you know . - Well , what did they want ? Cabbages . - What ? - Cabbages ! I see . It was a Red Indian cabbage-raiding party . Sounds very nasty . Where did they come from ? Oh , Marbury way . MILLAR : Hey , you 've done really well , considering . How long have you been here ? It 's only about a year , isn 't it ? It 's less , probably . No , you 've got every reason to be proud of yourselves . Not many settlements have managed as well as you . And if you can think of anything else you might like , you know where to find us . Oh , and if you could rustle up some heavy horses , big demand for them . Anything that can be ridden , pull a plough , a cart ... There 's a waiting list for things like that . Aye . Well , we need seed . Oh , it 'll soon be time to get your planting done . What about potatoes ? Any seed potatoes ? Now , they are in short supply . So , we 'll save you some . And as he said , if you can come up with a horse or two , we 'll do a deal . Anyway , we 're off . A couple of places to call . Uh , you two have nae tell anybody about this place ? Of course not . What do you think we are ? No , strictest confidence . - Privacy respected . - That 's us . You 're too good a customer . No one knows you 're here and no one knows we 're here . No one knows anything , really , do they ? No one like that . Or a girl . Oh , they wouldn 't get into Marbury this way without me noticing . They 'd be coming from the east . Southeast , perhaps . This should be the right road , then . But they might have been diverted , had to swing round . There 's about 40 roads going into town . ( SIGHS ) - Come far ? - Far enough , Mr Oliver . Must want to see him a lot . He 's on his way back . I haven 't seen him for ages . He was at Nettleton . But a man there said he 'd been seen here at Marbury . It seemed worth a try . - Husband ? - Sort of . ( LAUGHING ) What 'd he do , run away ? Daft , running away from a lovely girl like you . I sometimes think it would be nice to have a woman around . Nice creatures . Soft . Feminine . Pretty smile . Oh , yes , I can see her now . Standing by my side , looking up at me and saying ... Well , what are you going to do , then ? Well , I 'll ride over there and have a look . I can 't promise it 's going to make any difference . Well , you know , it 's bad enough having all these other immigrants , let alone Red Indians . And Swedes . - I 'll come with you . - No , you 'd better stay here . I 'm sure Mrs Butterworth will entertain you . Well , I suppose I 'd better let you into the house , though I don 't know what on earth I 'm going to do with you . Foreigners . ( SPEAKING NORWEGIAN ) ( DOOR OPENING ) Psst ! ( SOFTLY ) Aren 't you going to ask them ? - No . - If you don 't , I will . If you do so , I 'll kill you . What 's the matter ? You 're not happy with the deal ? Or we can spare some more if you like , on credit . Favour for a favour , that sort of thing . ( GIRL SCREAMING ) Everything 's all right . - Ask him . - What 's going on ? You 're not torturing someone , are you ? That didn 't sound at all nice . Everything 's fine . ( SCREAMING CONTINUES ) They 're all just playing . All right , then , we 'll be off . Eh , are yous gonna pass the old woman 's cottage ? - Can do . - Aye , well , I might want to come to , eh , borrow a couple of chickens . Fine . Hey , Tommy . You 're on . They 'd be your best bet , Millar and McIntosh . Move about a bit , trading . They 'd have heard of your bloke if he was around . - Where would I find them ? - Oh , now you 're asking me . Could be anywhere . They have a warehouse , though , just outside Marbury . Nice blokes . Whoa , boy . Whoa , whoa , whoa . What do you want ? I 've got nothing for you . Well , we might have something for you . Vegetables , got some good knives , a couple of axes , it 's good stuff . ( CLUCKING ) - And I 've been raided again . - Oh , no , that 's terrible . - What did they get ? - All my cabbages . Oh , dear . Oh , dear . Look , have a couple of ours . Oh , no , I don 't want charity . Oh , come on , Mrs B , we 'll ask a favour of you one day . Well , as a matter of fact , her bloke 's doing me a favour . - Oh , yes ? - Yes , he 's gone off after them Indians . Well , that 's good . It 's not right , you being attacked . Look , hang on , I 'll get some cabbages for you . Leave those here . Get back to the Eagle and say the old woman 's sent someone after him . He probably needs taking down a peg or two . Here you are . Probably not as good as yours . Oh , you 're so right , they aren 't . I grow real cabbages , not puny things like that . - Thanks all the same . - No trouble . Well , if there 's nothing else you want , we 'll be off . ( CLICKING TONGUE ) See you soon . Come on , boy . Hey , wait a minute , you dropped these . Did we ? Oh , thanks . Hey , you sure you wouldn 't like them ? We can spare a couple . What , rubbish like this ? No , I have beautiful chickens , not sparrows . You know best . Hey , what 's your bloke 's name ? He 's called Greg . And he 's not my bloke . PHILIP : ( SOFTLY ) You 've got to do something about it . You can 't just send someone to clap a hand over her mouth every time she cries out . She 's in pain . She needs medical attention . And where do you think she 's gonna get that , eh ? There is none . She 'll just have to get better on her own . How ? She 's gone deaf , blind ... Libbie 's only 13 , and she 's got that stuff on her fingers . Aye . It 's on her toes as well . - Some of the others have started . - Who ? Bob Dolough , complaining of pins and needles . Some of the others are chumming about saying they 've got ants in their pants . You 've got to do something about it . It 's worrying everyone . Aye . But we 'll wait a bit longer , it might just go . We might all just die . - Eagle , someone 's coming up to the camp . - Who 's on guard ? - Bernie . - Right , get him . - Look , there he is . - It 's an intruder . ( BOY WHOOPING ) - Is he practising his war cry ? - What do you want ? Well , I want to see the grown-ups . Are they all out working ? Well , what time do they get back ? Look , I 'm not going to do you any harm . You just tell me where the grown-ups are . - They 're the ones I want to see . - ( WHOOPING ) You know , there 's an old lady down there who claims that she was attacked by Red Indians . I presume this is the right reservation ? Well , do the grown-ups know that you attack defenceless old ladies who are terrified of you ? It 's not a particularly brave thing to do . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) - I found him for you , Eagle . - Aye . Well , put him in the box . Eagle , I don 't know how he did it . I was watching all the time , honest , I was . Aye , well , he 's here now , ain 't he ? He 's not the Invisible Man . When I give you a job to do , you do it . Hey ! - There 's no need for that . - You ! You speak when you 're spoken to . If you do that again , I 'll break it across your backside . What did you say ? Look , if he was your guard , he was in the wrong position . I could see him miles away . And the tin cans are an old trick . Whoever set it up should have made it less obvious . Look , mister , I told you to speak when you 're spoken to . ( KIDS LAUGHING ) Okay , kids , a game 's a game . Attacking defenceless old ladies is one ... ( ALL CHEERING ) You know , if I was you I 'd wait until the adults get back before you do something that you might regret . There 's nae adults here . I 'm in charge . Oh , do stop worrying . He can look after himself , you know . He 's not a kid , is he ? He 'd been to Norway to see what things were like there . And now he 's supposed to be making his way back to us cross-country . I keep getting garbled messages . Mind you , as we 're doing the same thing in the opposite direction , I suppose there 's a chance we might slip by each other . Miss completely . - Ships in the night ? - Yes . So , when I heard he was gonna be here at Marbury I ... Where are your friends now ? Well , they 're at Nettleton . Pretty dangerous thing to do , trekking cross-country . What do they think about that ? I didn 't bother to ask , I knew what they were likely to say . So , I just left a note and rode off . - Well , they 'll be worried . - Yes . I said I 'd be back before they left . They 'll wait for me . You 've not seen him , then ? No , I think we can safely say we 've never seen him . What was his name again ? - Greg . - Greg ? No . No Gregs , I 'm afraid . Oh , well . That 's that . - Wild goose chase . - What are you gonna do ? Go back tomorrow , if you can put me up tonight . Oh , sure . Sure . But don 't rush off . You never know . We might remember something . No better ? Fingers ? One fell off . It just fell off . I touched it so gently , it fell on the bed . And Libbie didn 't even seem to notice . Eagle , we 've got to get help . We 've probably got some awful disease . Things are just getting worse and worse . They 're all twitching , jumping , talking nonsense . Connor 's gone deaf , too . Look , if we get grownups to come here , they 'll ruin everything . We 'll be back where we started . Bossed about , treated like babies . I 'd rather die here . But none of us want to die . They know something 's wrong . They 're frightened . There 's nothing else they can think about . Can 't you ask that bloke ? He might know something . What was the name of that film you saw ? About Africa ? I 'm not interested in films . If you don 't do something , everyone 's going to turn on you . Look , why don 't you just listen and answer my questions , eh ? I 'm trying to give them other things to think about . Now , one of my teachers at school said that kings in the old days used to stop the nobles from fighting at him , by pushing them off into the seas to fight . That 's what I 've been doing with these raids . And that 's why I want to know about that film you saw . The one about the African tribe and them explorers that they tortured . - Why didn 't you tell her ? - I rather fancy her , that 's why . - Come on , her bloke 's around . - Well , he was , but he might not be now . No , I don 't mean the kids will have hurt him . He might just have pushed off . Well , she said he was buzzing round like a blue-tailed fly . Well , now she 's buzzing off like a blue-tailed fly , isn 't she ? I 'll send her to see the old woman . That 'll keep her here for a bit . If she finds him , fine . If not , I 'll ask her back here . - You could do me a favour . - What ? Well , drop a few hints that he was rather keen on that Norwegian bird and vice versa . - Come on . - I would , if I was him . He doesn 't know when he 's onto a good thing . EAGLE : Then they tied him to a pole , packed mud all over him , and then they baked him over a fire . ( KIDS LAUGHING ) - But that 's not what we 're going to do . - ALL : Oh . No , you see , in the film , they took all his clothes off , and made him run through the jungle . Some warriors chased him , and they had weapons , but he didnae . But it wouldn 't be fair to take his clothes off . ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) No , we 're gonna take his boots and his socks . He 'll run barefoot . Get Bernie out of the box . You know , you 've watched too many films . EAGLE : Just telly , big man . Yeah , well , it 's a pity you couldn 't get BBC 2 . Pity you 're just like everybody else , eh ? We are not kids , you know . We can look after ourselves . ALL : Yeah . - GREG : I never said you couldn 't . - Look , you came here to take us back . Lock us up in them settlements . Treat us like kids , eh ? Make us work for you . Slave labour , like it was in them Dickens ' days . But we 're our own masters here , you know . This is our territory . This is my team . I 'm the Eagle ! ( KIDS CHEERING ) Where 's the gun ? You let him in , you get the gun . If you kill him , you stay . If he escapes , you 're out . Have the rest of yous got your things ? KIDS : Yes . Annie , come here . Now , I want you to pretend that that tree 's the big man here . Now , what you going to do to him ? Pull it out , big man . I 'll give you two minutes ' start , big man . - I 'll count to 100 . - Yeah , well , shouldn 't it be 120 ? I count slowly . One , two , - three , four , five , six , seven ... - KIDS : Five , six , seven ... It just slipped my mind . Only remembered this morning . There was this blonde girl . Oh , she was beautiful . She talked about her bloke . That 's right , isn 't it ? She seemed very concerned about him . I got the impression they were together , if you know what I mean . - Where 's the cottage ? - Oh , it 's a fair distance . We 'll take you part of the way . A little trip to make to get rid of some axes . I 'm sorry it slipped my mind . - Doesn 't matter . - Of course it matters . You 're a lovely girl . You 've come a long way to see your friend . I 'm sorry . Listen , we 'll be back this evening . If you don 't find him , will you promise to come back here ? Well , it 's safe here , you 've got to admit that . Look , we 'll do all we can to help . We both think you 're a really nice girl . If you ever needed a home , you and the kids , you 'd always be welcome . As a matter of fact , we 've got a pile of stuff there you can take back with you . We 're fond of kids . World wouldn 't be the same without them . ( ALL SHOUTING ) BOY 1 : Get him ! BOY 2 : Come on ! ( DOGS BARKING ) Get him ! ( PANTING ) BOY 1 : Come on ! BOY 2 : Get him ! BOY 3 : Come on ! BOY 4 : Come on ! Get him ! BOY 5 : Come on , lads ! BOY 1 : Get him ! BOY 2 : Get him ! ( SHOUTING CONTINUES ) Get him ! Get him ! Come on ! Get him ! He 's over here ! He went that way ! ( EXHALES ) Now , we split up here . Just keep straight on till you get to the river , over the bridge and then follow the signs to Hepple . - See you later on , I hope . - Thanks . - She won 't be back . - She will . - Because of you ? - No . I don 't think her bloke 's still there . Anyway , the way he 's gallivanting about , he doesn 't deserve a bird like that . Oh , and you do ? Well , I certainly deserve something more attractive than you . BOY : Get him ! Get him ! Come on ! KIDS : Get him ! Get him ! BOY 1 : Come on ! Catch him ! BOY 2 : Get him ! Get him ! ( SIGHS ) GREG : How many ? EAGLE : Thirteen . GREG : When did it all start ? EAGLE : A month or so ago . It might have been before , some of these were away . - On a raid ? - Aye . They just seemed to be itching . Complaining of pins and needles and things crawling all over their hands and legs . - I thought it would go away . - GREG : And what do the others think ? EAGLE : They allow me to do that . I take the decisions . ( GROANING ) - What do you think it is ? - GREG : I 've really no idea . - Is this all that happens ? - EAGLE : No . Some are deaf . There 's one in here I think you should see . Do you know what it is ? Well , I know what I think it is . Could you send one of your team down to the cottage to get hold of the old lady and the girl that 's with her ? - But what is it ? - I 'd like them to have a look first . There were some notebooks in my saddlebags , you haven 't burned them or thrown them away , have you ? - No . - Well , I 'd like those . At least they 'll tell us where the nearest doctor is . Now , did she ever cut herself ? Can you remember that ? At any time ? I don 't know , ' cause she was indoors most of the time . She cooked a lot . She used a knife then , I suppose . Peeling and scraping . She might have cut herself doing that . She never complained about anything ? - Did she have all the other symptoms ? - I think so . Look , I can 't really remember , she might have said something . But I 've probably told her not to be so stupid . Half the time I 've got to tell them all not to be such babies . You don 't have to blame yourself . What 's wrong with her ? She 's got gangrene . On her fingers and toes . - Do you know what it is ? - Sort of . Well , it 's sometimes called " mortification " . And what that means is that that part of the body is dead because the blood isn 't getting through . And you think she might have got that from a wee cut ? I know next to nothing about medicine , Eagle . Mrs Butterworth knows more than me . She was a nurse once . - So what can you do about it ? - Nothing . Surgery is the only answer , major surgery . It 's reached what they call an irreversible stage . I 'm sorry , Eagle . There 's a Dr Adams near Lincoln . That 's a hundred miles away . I doubt if he 'd be able to do anything for Libbie . He might for the others . What do you mean ? They 're all gonna be like Libbie ? Well , they might . We just don 't know . Will she ... ? It won 't be easy for her . Can we really do nothing for her ? There is one thing you can do . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Anyone at home ? Greg ? Agnes ? Mrs Butterworth ? - Shall we go back to the cottage ? - No , we 'd better stay here . They 'll fit us in somewhere . - I 'd rather be in my own bed . - Well , we all would . - But I think we should stay here . - ( SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) You go and get some sleep . I 'll sit up with her . I 'm fine . Philip tells me you sit up with her every night . It 's my job . They 're my team . You can 't do anything here that I can 't . Go on . Did you mean all that stuff ? About her ? ( GASPS ) Libbie 's dead , Eagle . I 'm sorry . She died in her sleep . Dead ? In her sleep . It 's a good thing . I hope , if I 'm ever in that condition , the same thing happens to me . Aye . Rabbits with myxomatosis . - What ? - Oh , nothing . Well ... Thanks . - For what ? - You know for what ! You were very fond of her , weren 't you ? She was my sister . And bring back every piece of medical equipment that you can find . Medical equipment ? Well , anything that the kids haven 't got and you think they might need . Well , they need drugs . - There might be something at Ainsworth . - And what was there , a hospital ? No , civil defence place . - What are you going to do ? - Research . Do you think we could have got it from the rabbits ? Well , I haven 't heard of myxomatosis being passed on to humans . But I suppose it 's possible . But I don 't think that this is myxomatosis . - You don 't think we 're all ill ? - Yeah , I think you are . You 're well-organised here . Well , look , didn 't you notice anything strange about any of the people at the settlements you raided ? They were only raids . We never took anything of value . They were just to cheer us up , make us forget about this illness , stop worrying . There was always some who wanted to be looked after by adults . - Mums and dads . - But not you ? I come from Glasgow . Every week there 's a new excuse for violence . Broken homes , too much money , too little money , lack of clean facilities , lack of parental authority , the damp , the disease , the urine , the rats . - And who said that ? - Oh , they all say that . We were just bored . Only one guy talked about the boredom . " The unending tedium " , he called it . Doing nothing and taking all day to do it . But they 're all quotes , aren 't they ? Out of a newspaper . Aye , that was with the word games . We read the rest in a book ourselves . Laughed about it . Pretended to be them soft newspapermen and do-gooders . But we didnae want them to be soft . Or to make excuses for us . Well , you didn 't want them to be hard , did you ? We wanted to be treated like adults . Big men like you . Weren 't you treated like adults after the Death ? You must be joking . Things got worse . I ran away four times ! I got beaten , chained up , locked in a cellar for two weeks . I began to look on Glasgow as the good old days . Well , you just found the wrong settlement . We found the right settlement . Here . It 's ours . We 're free . It works ! - Someone 's been here . - How do you know ? I can feel it . Atmosphere . - Perhaps it was the Red Indians . - Ah ! Don 't be daft . And someone was here last night . Might still be here . - Slept here . - Goldilocks . Ah ! No . Whoever was here had dark hair , not very long . Just ordinary stuff . Vegetables , rabbit , deer , sheep . Oh , aye , and corn sometimes , when we made a trade . - Who with ? - Two blokes , Millar and McIntosh . - We exchange things . - Where are they from ? Marbury . It 's not far away . Oh , no , they 're all right . They only take advantages . But not as bad as some of the others . They have nae grassed on us yet . We 'd bury the lot of them if they did . And you haven 't found any pills or , you know , stuff like that ? - Taken it as a dare ? - No chance . We make our own rules here . Nobody smokes anything . Leaves , plants , them funny mushrooms . And boys and lasses sleep in separate rooms . There are rules , you know . We made them up . - Nobody told us to do anything . - Okay , okay . Well , whatever this is , don 't you think it might have been a good idea if someone had told you not to do something or other ? ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) So , it 's obviously not cuts , grazes or burns . The symptoms cover everything , Greg . Deafness , blindness , gangrene , hallucinations . Well , I didn 't hallucinate ... ( COUGHS ) ... about somebody being in my house . Someone was there , all right . It will be one of the great unsolved mysteries of our time , Mrs Butterworth . - What ? - AGNES : What ? - What did you just say ? - About what ? About Mrs B. I just said it would be one of the great unsolved mysteries of our time . - Well , that 's it . - What ? Oh , don 't start that again . GREG : No , no , give me some mysteries . Well , who was in my house ? Real , famous mysteries . What do you mean , ghosts , hauntings , murders ? Mistletoe boughs , headless horses ... No , no , no , I mean true , famous true stories . AGNES : Well , about what ? People , places , animals , cars , pigs , sheep ... - That 's it ! - Sheep ? Do you mean they got this illness from sheep ? No , not sheep . Ships . But we 're a hundred miles from the sea . There aren 't any ships . The Marie Celeste , the phantom ship . Everything on board as it should be , but there was no crew . Well , this isn 't a phantom ship . But what made it a phantom ship was what they had to eat . - What ? - What ? GREG : Oh , come on , food ! ( SNIFFING ) How long have you been making this bread ? - Couple of months . - And does everybody eat it ? No , some didnae like it and some have been away . Well , would Libbie have had anything to do with this ? She made it . It was one of her jobs . All right , have you got any musical instruments ? - What for ? - ( CHUCKLES ) Have you got any ? Aye . Guitar , small drums ... Okay , well , you get those and tin cans and things . And then I want everyone that has signs of this disease outside . - What are you going to do ? - A war dance . ( MIMICKING INDIAN WAR CRY ) I think he 's got it . ALL : # We all live in a yellow submarine # Yellow submarine Yellow submarine # We all live in a yellow submarine # Yellow submarine Yellow submarine # We all live in a yellow submarine # Yellow submarine Yellow submarine # We all live in a yellow submarine # Yellow submarine Yellow submarine # We all live in a yellow submarine # Yellow submarine # Yellow submarine # We all live in a yellow submarine # Yellow submarine # It 's in the bread , made from rye . You know , one of the suggestions about the Marie Celeste was they all went mad from eating this stuff and jumped overboard . - Well , how does it work ? - I have no idea . I just know there 's a sort of a fungus which grows on the rye when it 's stored wet . And that leads to all the things that your team have got . Why the dancing ? Well , I 'm afraid that 's another unsolved mystery . Just remember reading a suggestion once that The Pied Piper of Hamelin was playing to children suffering from this same disease . He used to call it St Anthony 's Fire . Oh , how fascinating . But he wasn 't stealing the children away . He was actually helping them . Because music and the rhythm seemed to have help ease and soothe the convulsed limbs . But there were a lot of outbreaks in the middle ages . EAGLE : Why not now ? Well , people eat less rye bread for a start . And there are stricter rules and regulations about food . Well , there were . We haven 't got any now . There 's no Ministry of Agriculture or Department of Health to look after us . But about 20 years ago , in France , a whole village went mad from eating this stuff , even with strict rules and regulations . - Did you grow the rye yourselves ? - No . - How did you get it ? - Through the traders . - She won 't be back . - Oh , yes , she will . Today . I can feel it in my bones . She 's on her way . Let me deal with them , Eagle . I 'll bring them back . You know what you gotta do here ? Aye . Get the rye and burn it . - See anything ? - No . - Where 's the kid ? - He 's gone back . Look , do we have to go through with this ? Well , he 's coming for us , isn 't he ? Well , can 't we explain we 've done nothing ? I mean , how were we to know ? We take everything on trust . - It might have been us . - Shut up and keep watching . Well , you sold it to them . I wasn 't even there . Well , whose idea was it ? Get rid of the rye on the kids . If they can 't afford the best , give them second best . It was all they could afford , wasn 't it ? We couldn 't let the little blighters starve , could we ? Shut up ! Where 's the water ? Millar ? McIntosh ? GREG : Where have they all gone ? AGNES : ( SIGHING ) I don 't know . They all met here after they burnt the rye . Eagle wouldn 't let us listen but he sounded very angry . MRS BUTTERWORTH : I think they went after the traders . GREG : No , we 'd have met . And he didn 't say where they were going ? - AGNES : No , he took everyone . - Perhaps they 're moving camp . No , it 's got something to do with those two . We 've done nothing . Trading , that 's all . This lot west of Marbury had the rye . And we bought it , we gave them what the kids gave us . Straight up , no profit . We thought we were helping them . How were we supposed to know it had fungus or whatever it is ? Why don 't you go after the lot that sold it to us ? Yeah , well , we will , once we 've dealt with you . Dealt with ? - Oh , those kids will kill us . - No one 's getting killed . And you 've got no idea where they went ? I think I know where they went . - Where ? - The outpost . What 's that ? They said if ever there was an invasion , there 's this place they call " the outpost " . They keep guns and things . And food for emergencies . Is that true ? Well , is it ? - Well , what is this place ? - It 's a civil defence centre . Stuffed with food rations for emergencies , nuclear war . - Are there any guns there ? - No . Well , what are you looking so worried about ? Hey ? There ... Oh , my God . Now what ? What ? They 're mined . The army mined them to stop people breaking in during the Death . We told the kids not to go there . Honest . - You gotta believe us . - GREG : You stupid ... Okay , everybody , it 's all right . Yous can get up . One dead and 14 with symptoms . Now , you 'll work six months for the one that 's dead and month for each of my team that 's bad . - What 's the alternative ? - There isn 't one . And when yous have done that , you can go . And whilst you 're here , yous can keep up your trading as long as one of you is always at camp . I 'll go and get rid of the rest of the rye . - I 'll wait for you here . - No , I think you 'd better get back . - Back to Whitecross ? - Yeah . You haven 't sold this rye to anyone else ? Have you got any other deals up your sleeves ? - No , nothing . - Are you sure ? No one 's calling on you ? Taking stuff away ? - No one . - GREG : Okay . Quick , quick . Come and see what I found in the field over there . BOY 1 : What is it ? Come on , let 's get it , then . - Come on ! - Come on . Oh . ( KIDS LAUGHING ) ( CHEERING ) - Couldn 't we catch it ? - We could use it to pull logs . Work for us . We could ride it . Can 't we keep it as a pet ? I don 't know . It 's probably been in a zoo or a circus all of its life . Chained up , nae freedom . Now it can go where it wants . I mean , yous wouldnae like it if yous were to be cooped up again , would yous ? KIDS : No . BERNIE : It 's true . Anyway , why don 't we just feed it on , eh ? - Please . - We 've hardly got enough for ourselves . And it would probably tread on all our crops . They go mad sometimes , you know . Go musth or something , they call it . We 're far better off as we are . - ALL : Yes . - I bet somebody shoots it . Ah , somebody probably will . - Look . - What is that , another again ? BOY : No , it 's a rider . Have you got the binoculars ? No , they 're not here . Why , what 's wrong ? Oh , it 's nothing . Just looks like someone .

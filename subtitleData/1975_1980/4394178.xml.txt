 Where were you going when you ... There are suitcases in your car . - Don 't answer him . - You looked , did you ? - Yes , I looked . - I said don 't answer him . - We don 't have to . - ( Sapphire ) You do have to . If you want us to get you back into your own time . - To face whatever you have to face . - What do you mean ? ! - I don 't know , you tell me . - What do you mean ? - It 's obvious you 're running away . - Are we ? ! Don 't you think we 've had enough ? ( Rattling ) That 's odd , I was thinking of playing that machine . ( Woman ) Oh , my God . Look ! - I was holding ... - ( Sapphire ) Look . Look at the clock . ( Sapphire ) It 's moved forward by ten minutes . ( Steel ) Our bodies haven 't been affected , only this place has . So , what is it moving forward to ? To whatever is going to happen here . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Mercury , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' ' ... 4 preci ... will be 9 : 04 preci ... will be 9 ... ' ( Man ) ' ... expected ... expected ... ' ( Tuning ) ( Music looping ) It 's at a standstill again . At four minutes past nine . And the radio , apart from a slight ten-minute variation . - And the traffic ? - Different vehicles but the same repeated sound . Let 's find out more about those two - as a loving couple . Well , they are only human , aren 't they ? - What happened ? - Hm ? That sound , things moving by themselves , something happened . It did . You may not have noticed but time here is at a standstill . - That 's not possible . - And yet you 're here . - Where did you get this ? - I poured it for myself . - From where ? - From behind there . - Would you like it back ? - No . ( Steel ) ' Separate them . ' Erm , do you think I might have the keys to your car ? - What for ? - And your cases , if you don 't mind ? - Well , I do mind . - Oh . Well , it makes no difference . - Don 't ! - If he tries to get into that car ... Don 't play their game ! What is our game ? He 's gone outside . ( Steel ) Yes . - But outside ... - He 's perfectly safe , provided neither of you tries to leave this place . Hey , you ! We happen to be running away , that 's all . She from her husband , I from my wife . We already know that . Oh , you know that , do you ? Well , that 's not exactly an arrestable offence , now , is it ? Nor is being here in the future where we don 't belong . We didn 't mean to come here , we 're not trespassing . Adultery ? - They can 't hang you for it . - How can you be sure ? - Perhaps in this time period ... - We ... We don 't belong to this time period , remember ? Excuse me . Lovely old car , isn 't it ? ( Pinball machine rattling ) He has every right to be upset . - To be angry . - To be protective ? Yes . Why not ? No one can condemn us . Only the Church but ... I don 't care about the Church and neither does he . - He ? - What ? You 're referring to him as " he " , does he not have a name ? - Of course he has . - Then tell me it . No . All right , then . Your name , tell me that . You keep telling us that you 've done no wrong . - It 's true . - Then tell me your names . - Why should I ? - All right , him . Tell me about him . - Where did you meet him ? - Ask him . - How long have you known him ? - Seven or eight months . - That 's not long . - Long enough to ... - Long enough to what ? - To know that I love him . I suppose that means you 're able to forgive him almost anything . No , it doesn 't mean that . What year is this ? Which decade ? The 1980s . Therefore there 's no need for me to lie to you . I mean , with 30-odd years lost somewhere , well ... I could tell you just about anything . I mean , you can 't very well go back and check up on us , can you ? It 's a clear night . What if she and I were to climb into the car and drive away ? Just drive back where we 've come from ? We 've explained , there is no time here . - You 'd arrive here again . - Arrive again ? - How can we arrive again ? - Isn 't it obvious ? If we went straight back ... no stops , no turns , just drove in a straight line for 50 miles ? You would arrive back here once more . Oh . - What if you came with me ? - Me ? Yes . You belong to this place , this time ... - Do I ? - So , you 'd be my ... my passport . So , if I went back , in a straight line , with you at my side , then what would happen ? What would you like to happen ? Excuse me . That lady you 're prepared to move mountains for is waiting for you . What was that ? A bit more fun at our expense ? - Possibly . - Yes , I thought so . ( Hollow , echoing jingle ) ( Sapphire ) Silver ! ( Humming ) - ' Steel . ' - ' Yes , I heard that . - ' It came from outside . ' - ' Is the woman still there ? ' 'Of course she 's still ... 'No ... No , she 's not . 'Wait . ' - Sorry , what did you say ? - I said , " Yes , I thought so . " The woman disappeared , just for a moment . - Was there a shadow ? - Yes . - It happened to the man . - And the time ? Still the same , four minutes past nine . - How do you explain the shadows ? - ( Silver ) I can 't . Whatever happened , it hasn 't upset them . That sound , what was it ? Something banging . - Open window , perhaps ? - No , it wasn 't an impersonal sound . Impossible , time 's at a standstill . No one can leave or enter this place . It was something rattling in the wind . One of the garage signs , perhaps . No , it was a higher frequency , more like a cymbal or a triangle . - You mean it wasn 't an accident ? - No , the sound was made by someone . Someone who wants us to know they 're here . Nothing . Whatever it is ... it 's not in here . ( Hollow , echoing jingle ) We heard it again , somewhere above us . It was here . It was close by . - Did you see anything here ? - Nothing . That image we saw of the old man , perhaps it was something to do with him . You said the image was first seen in here ? Yes . Nothing . Just a moment . Why Silver ? Why is he here ? - Because he was sent . - Sent to do what ? To wait and watch , same as us . Steel , I want to talk . - Why Silver ? He 's a technician . - Ask him that . I have . He doesn 't know why he 's here and neither do we . - Of course we do . - Think about it , Steel . - Why are we here ? - Because ... We 're usually sent at the beginning , when damage has begun . - It has begun . - I don 't see any signs of damage . Time has stopped here , it 's standing still . People from 1948 are running around in the 1980s . That 's not serious damage , not at this stage . Not yet . You said it earlier - we are on some countdown to an event due to happen . But supposing that it already has happened ? That this is it , the three of us not knowing why we 're here ? Supposing there 's nothing for us to wait for ? Supposing it is waiting for us ? Here . Quickly . ( Sapphire ) ' He 's no longer an image . ' ( Steel ) ' No . ' Is it ... Are you wanting service ? Only that 's at the front of the building , not here . This is private . ( Steel ) ' Talk to him . ' What 's wrong ? This is private , this part of the building . You shouldn 't be here . What 's wrong ? Why are you frightened ? Well ... I suppose it 's cos I can 't see you very clearly . And I 've never believed in ghosts so I 'm not likely to want to start now . - What do you see ? - I see everything as it should be ... except for you lot . - Tell us . - Tell you ? Yes , tell us what you can see . Well , I see the house , don 't I ? As it should be , as I should see it . The sheds and the path ... and the cold frame . That wooden fence there ... and you lot sort of ... sort of over it all . In the wrong ... Well , in the wrong place . What year is this ? - What year ? - Yes . What year do you expect it to be ? It 's 1925 , of course ... ( Echoing ) ( Echoing and fading ) 'Of course ... of course ... ' We were the images that time . We were the ones that didn 't belong . 1925 ? And 1948 . So which of them is wrong ? Or lying . What kind of a lie would it be ? They 've described accurately a place and a man . They described the place and the man . Yes . 23 years later . Maybe , as we did , they saw the ghost of an old man 23 years ago . But he wasn 't a ghost . If anything , we were the ghosts to him . My first thought is that everything is haphazard , time just mixed up and ... Your second thought ? It 's just too haphazard . It 's like something that 's been designed . Sapphire was saying the same thing earlier . It 's like something being designed . - And what exactly we 're doing here . - Yes . What was your briefing ? Well , it ... Come to think of it , it wasn 't the usual briefing . - It was like a knowledge . - Something telling you to be here ? - Yes . And you ? - The same . Steel ? Yes ... There 's one simple way to find out . Silver , have you been told anything we haven 't ? Well , I 've just said ... - Concerning this place . - No . You weren 't given any special information ? - Special ? - Privileged . - Something withheld from us ? - No . - You were here before us . - That 's right . - Why ? - Well , I don 't know why . Specialists never move in until operators have done their work . - But this is different . - Is it ? Haven 't we just said so ? Didn 't we agree ... We haven 't agreed anything , we 're comparing notes . Fine . Ignoring the fact that you are operators and I am a mere specialist , but accepting the fact it was shared knowledge that brought us here ... - ( All ) Why the delay of six hours ? - Yes . Between my arrival and yours . I mean , six hours ? You could have picked up a lot of privileged information in six hours . Well , we don 't know why . So , there 's one simple way of finding out . We just leave this ... ( Rumbling ) - Time . - Has moved forward again . ( Sapphire ) By 20 minutes . And into that . ( Percussive jingle ) It 's happened again . - You heard that sound ? - ( Man ) Yes . It was the sound of an instrument . I think it was a tambourine . - A tambourine ? - Yes . No , we didn 't hear that . If it is part of an arranged plan , would those two be a part of it ? - I don 't know . - 10 minutes , then 20 . - When does it stop , I wonder ? - When it 's ready . I don 't like being part of an arranged plan . I prefer to make the moves . Steel ... Listen . ( Heavy rainfall ) - It 's just the rain . - No , there 's someone walking . There 's someone walking outside . No , don 't ! Whoever it is , they 're coming this way . They 're coming here . Stay here . ( Footsteps , faint ) ( Man ) The clock ... We know . What is it ? - Someone coming . - Someone coming here ? ( Footsteps approaching ) ( Footsteps continue ) - Where ? - Just outside . Be careful . Whoever it was couldn 't have gone , I would have heard them . Close the door behind me . Lock them . ( Phone ) ( Ringing stops ) ( Ringing ) ' ... be 9 : 24 ... be 9 : 24 ... 'be 9 : 24 ... be 9 ... ' - Is Steel back yet ? - From where ? - He went outside . - Well , no . The rain 's stopped . Storm must have passed . Silver , nothing is supposed to change here . It 's still 9 : 24 . - What shall I do ? - You 'd better find him . - Oh , who is it ? - What ? The person who 's come here , who is it ? - It didn 't happen . - We heard someone arrive . ( Percussive jingle )

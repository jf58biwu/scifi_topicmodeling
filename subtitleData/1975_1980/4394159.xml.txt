 ( Machine-gun fire and explosions ) Sammy ... Pearce . Private S Pearce . You should have left us alone . We were causing no harm . We just wanted what was owed to us . ( Man ) Pearce , come on ! You asked me once , remember ? You asked me to sit and talk with you . Well , I 've sat and I 've talked . On my terms for a change and not yours . It 's gonna be a favourable winter . It 'll slip into spring like they was one and the same . And then it 'll be Eastertide . Anyway , you 'll be leaving us soon . You 've got no choice . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' ( Machine-gun fire and explosions ) Everything 's all right , isn 't it ? It is now , yes . It is now . Steel ? Yes , me . No ! Stay there . All right . - It 's early morning . It 's dawn . - I know , I just realised . - Why is it dawn ? - Well , how should I know why ? What is it ? I 've just woken up , I 've been having terrible dreams ... I had a few myself . In one of them , you attacked me ... with a bunch of flowers . Give me your hands . 'We brought you here after the seance . 'Tully and I brought you to this room . Is that right ? 'Sapphire ? Sapphire , do you hear me ? 'Can you hear me ? 'You can 't hear me , can you ? ' Of course I can hear you . We 've got work to do . There are some things I must remember . Stab me . I remember the girl with the flowers ! It wasn 't me . - An illusion ? - Not quite . A projected image . - Created by Pearce ? - Through Pearce by the darkness . - But you didn 't see the darkness . - I was aware of it . # La la-la la-la la-la-la-la , picking up gold and ... # I remember wooden desks ... and inkwells . A school - an old school ? - Eleanor . - Who ? - You don 't remember her ? - No . Probably because she wasn 't created by the darkness . She was invited to take part in the seance . ( Children chattering ) You have been busy in my absence . ( Pearce , echoing ) ' Eleanor ! Look ... ' I do remember a flower . What kind of flower ? ( Pearce ) ' That 's a pasqueflower . ' A wild flower . Its petals are a kind of purple . ( Pearce ) ' Well , they 're rare . ' It 's very beautiful , and rare , but I don 't know why I remember it . 'Come next Eastertide , I 'll pick that pasqueflower . ' ( Soldiers ) # ... to light your fag , smile , boys ... # ( Machine-gun fire , Pearce crying and moaning ) I did visit your grave ! They suffered ! Why did they have to suffer so much ? - They told you ? - No , I sensed it . - What 's the solution ? - What ? Whatever it is the darkness promised , did you sense that ? - It was kept from me . - They were waiting . - Yes . - For more of their kind . Then what ? I don 't know . You don 't know where they were going ? - No . - But they were going somewhere ? - The darkness promised them that . - Why is it morning ? I 'm sorry , but you see I also fell asleep ... and I don 't sleep . Right here . When I awoke , there was a cobweb across the doorway . Here . It wasn 't on me , it was on the doorway . Here , analyse that . I don 't have to . - How long was I asleep ? - A few hours . Why ? There 's a new layer of dust in the waiting room , on the furniture and on the floor . This room is the same . I can 't see anything . No , but I can . Is it a natural formation of dust ? Yes . The particles are stratified . As an analyst , that means it wasn 't just dumped here in one go . - It is a natural formation . - How long would it take ... this amount of dust to settle naturally ? Chronologically , with this degree of stratification ... about twelve days . And you 've been asleep for a few hours and I for only one . Yes . - And suddenly it 's early morning . - That 's right . - It can 't happen . - It has happened . We 'll see . - You say we 're twelve days adrift . - Approximately , yes . Tully 's sandwiches . They were a bit stale but they were well wrapped and perfectly edible . I saw Tully eating one just before the seance and these are ... - Maybe it 's another image ? - Not this time . Why not ? The darkness is good at images . - You just admitted that . - Yes . There 's another image you missed when you were asleep . A barbed wire entanglement - I ran right into it . - Where is it now ? - It 's gone , of course . But the cobweb hasn 't . It 's still there . Did you receive any cuts from the wire ? - How could I ? It wasn 't ... - It wasn 't what ? It wasn 't real . This dust is . When I woke up , there was no dust on me and you said the cobweb hadn 't touched you , so those things were not put in our time , we 've been put in theirs . We 've been shunted forwards in time ? Yes ! And something else - they 're not here any more . Pearce and the others , they 've gone . - Perfect . - They have gone . The atmosphere has gone , the malevolence , the after-images , there 's nothing here any more . Even the darkness has gone . This place is free now . Free . Twelve days ahead . What happened in between ? - How should I know ? - Your subconscious ! My subconscious has missed twelve days as well . - You know what happened ? - Yes ? While we 've been shunted twelve days to one side , the darkness could have kept its promise ... To Pearce and the others . It could have , yes . But what has it done with Tully ? Tully ? Yes , where is Tully ? I left him with you . I told him to look after you . - I 've been asleep , remember ? - Tully ! Tully ? Tully ? We 've been moved forward twelve days , Tully 's been left behind . - We 're being manipulated . - Tully could just be hiding . - Why would he do that ? - I don 't know . Well , let 's find some proof . Tully ! ( Tully ) Will you ever forgive me ? Here - I 'm here . Thank God you 're safe . That 's all I want to say before I go , just thank God you 're safe . Tully ! No accusations , please . I apologise here and now . ( Electrical humming ) When I realised the darkness must have swallowed you up ... - When you what ? - The darkness , it was everywhere . You 're not injured ? - No . - Thank God for that . - You saw me ? - What ? Saw me on the wire . More or less , yes . There 's your proof . Oh , my dear girl ... I abandoned you . But I had to , you see . Anyway , I intended to send back help . - You will forgive me ? - Where were you ? I intended to send back help as quickly as possible . When you " abandoned " Sapphire , where did you go ? I ... I ... I looked for you and then I came up here . Then what ? Did the darkness swallow you up as well ? I 've no idea , I fell asleep . Sound asleep . You fell asleep ? Yes . L-I saw the ghost of that poor airman down there and then I saw the ghost of the young soldier up there . I crossed the bridge and ... I fell asleep . I slept like a log . I slept for hours . I must have done , I mean , it 's dawn , it 's almost daylight . Now you 're leaving ? ( Tully ) My work here is done . ( Sapphire ) Who decided that ? - I did . - Nothing decided it for you ? If you mean have I been frightened a little ? L-I don 't mind admitting I have been , that 's why I have to leave . - Mr Tully . - Yes ? Take a look at your sandwiches , Mr Tully . - If you leave now ... - I 'm not concerned about sandwiches . I am concerned about leaving when there 's so much more to learn . But that 's the way it must be , I 'm afraid . Naturally , I 'm thankful for the things I 've witnessed here , the opportunity to see the spirits of the dead , even speak to some of them . - Sadly I can 't talk to the others ... - What others ? ... before they explain their troubles . I said , what others ? The new ones , of course . You haven 't seen them ? No , I haven 't seen them . Tell me about them . - Well , they arrived . - When ? Just before I fell asleep last night . It wasn 't last night , Mr Tully . It was twelve days ago . - What ? - It was twelve days ago . Where did you see them ? - On the platform , waiting . - How many " new arrivals " ? Oh , I don 't know . Nine or ten , something like that . Anyway , I have to go ... ( Sharp whoosh ) Please let me go . I ... I have to leave . - Why ? - I 've explained , my work is done . What about those missed opportunities ? - Yes , but when I say that ... - Tell me ! Why are you leaving ? - Because I ... I made a promise . - A promise ? To whom ? - To it . - The darkness ? - Yes . - That brought the ghosts here ? That 's supposed to have swallowed us up ? - You 're both all right ... - You didn 't know that ! - But I told you ... - You made a promise , did you ? To the darkness that plays games with people 's minds and time . - I keep my word ! - You what ? They gave me my freedom when I asked them ... - You pleaded for it ! - If you like ! I pleaded for it and they gave it me last ... last night . Why are you still here , Mr Tully ? What ? If it wanted you to leave , why did it make you sleep ? I don 't know . ( Echoing hum ) Please ... I 'm so frightened . ( Sobbing ) I didn 't think I 'd ever be this frightened after so many years but I am , I 'm scared silly ! I mean , the way I deserted the pair of you ... - Sit down . - I did , I deserted you but ... but it frightened me , you see . Even my prayers didn 't work . - Mr Tully ... - Yes ? It 's gone . What ? The darkness . It 's not here any more . ( Tully ) And the ghosts of those poor lads ? They 've also gone . - In peace , do you think ? - We hope so . 'You want him to stay ... don 't you ? ' Because they deserve peace , you know , those poor lads . With all their problems , their bad luck ... - It isn 't fair . - ( Sapphire ) What isn 't ? There they are looking for peace after death after such short lives and ... here am I hoping for peace in my old age . 'Sapphire . ' That 's all I ... That 's all I want . - Well ? - The darkness hasn 't gone , has it ? As far as we 're concerned , yes . It 's playing games with time . It 's using time against us , isn 't it ? Yes . Therefore , it must be around here somewhere . - I suppose so . - Good . - I can 't do that , Steel . - Do what ? - I can 't take time back twelve days . - I don 't want you to . I want " it " to take us back . Can you make contact with it ? - Contact the darkness ? - Yes . - Possibly , if I tried . - Then try . - It 's hardly likely to ... - Cooperate ? I think it will . I want to make a deal with the darkness . - You want me to negotiate the deal ? - No , I 'll do that , after it 's taken us back . Just the two of us ? Yes . And Mr Tully . It may not give us a second chance . There 's no guarantee it 's given us a first one . - No . - Who says we 're safe in storage ? So let 's make that deal . Find it , Sapphire . Find the darkness . - What is it ? - Tully . Wait for me . Sapphire asked you to rest . - She did , yes . - Then sit down and rest . It 's for your own good , Mr Tully . What is ? - You were frightened , you said so . - Yes . Then you should sit down and rest . Calm yourself . - All right . - That 's better . How old are you ? 53 ? - 52 . - 52 ? Well , well . All the more reason to take care of yourself . You 'd rather I didn 't leave ? Go home ? Not because of the promise I made . I realise that was as bad as making a promise to the devil . And that would never do . No . I ... I ... didn 't want to leave just because I was frightened , it 's just that I don 't feel I 'm of any use here . My faith has taken a knock , you see . Well , we 'd rather you stayed . - Hm ? - We need you . - Really ? - I need you . You ? I never thought I 'd ... ever hear that kind of admission . You needing me ! All right , I was wrong about you . - That 's easy enough to ... - You sit there and relax . Sapphire and I , er ... have things to discuss . What things ? Private things . Ah . By the way , Mr Tully , do you have a family ? - A family ? - At home . No , I live alone except for my cat . I have a cat . - Nelson . - Nelson ? He 's only got one eye , you see . - Oh . - Yes , but don 't worry , my neighbour always feeds him if I 'm not there . Oh . Good . Now , quickly . What 's Tully doing ? Relaxing . - This deal ... - Now , Sapphire . - What exactly is it ? - I can 't tell you , not yet . - If I 'm to make contact ... - That 's all I want you to do . All right . - If I do make contact with it ... - It may decide to come back . - It can only come forward ... - Yes . It may well decide to bargain from here . - This room ? - Somewhere here ! You could be face to face with it , Steel ! Yes ! All right . But watch for it . I may not be able to help you . Please be careful . 'We wish to talk with you . 'We have something to say to you . 'Something important . 'Something important . 'Very important . '

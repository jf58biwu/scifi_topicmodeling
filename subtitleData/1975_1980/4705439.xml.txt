 [ HIGH-PITCHEDWHINE ] - What 's wrong ? . - That sound ... I keep hearing it . - Hypertension . - A sort of tone oscillation . - I heard it , too . But it was very faint . - Very probably . These exercises of yours , Cally , do not appear to improve the temper . Blake , I 've just been checking on Del-1 0 . It 's an ultra planet , fantastic mountain scenery , and the gravity 's so low you can practically fly . - Switch to manual . - Confirmed . Also the galaxy 's richest known source of Vita particles . It 's paradise . - Resume automatics . - Automatics are confirmed . Ever been to Del-1 0 before , Blake ? . Blake ? . No , Vila , I 've never been to Del-1 0 before ... I 'm in need of a dose of the Vitas , as are we all . Zen , destination time to Del-1 0 ? . Del-1 0 course aborted . New course . Destination asteroid PK-1 1 8 . Arrival : 1 8 . 55 . - What ? . - Del - 1 0 course aborted ... All right , I heard , I heard . I just don ' t believe it . - Hey , where 's Blake ? . - Why ? . What 's wrong ? . This course change , that 's what . We 're heading for some nowhere asteroid . - Del - 1 0 . - Not anymore . Blake 's just switched . - He what ? . - Blake ! - What about Del - 1 0 ? . - And what about the Vita particles ? . - They can wait . - Well , why this asteroid ? . Zen , details of destination . Asteroid PK-1 18 has diameter of 0 . 1 02 spacials . It was removed from serial orbit five years ago for Heurite ore extraction . Mined out in two years and discarded in Beta region . Life support systems installed by mining company presumed still functional . - Presumed ? . - Blake , what about Del-1 0 ? . Why are we diverting to some discarded rock ? . Any reason , Blake , or simply a whim ? . A guessing game , perhaps ? . - Priority mission . - Whose ? . - Why ? . - Objective ? . - I command this ship . - Do you indeed ? . - You lead . We don ' t take commands . - You 've always explained , given reasons for things . - When he had any . - This time I choose not to . - But , Blake , if you ... - For once just try trusting me . - What is this priority of his ? . - Exactly . He 's used a number of ploys to get his own way , but " Just try trusting me " ? . That 's weak even by his standards . - But why ? . Is he sick do you think ? . - What ? . - Space fatigue ? . - No symptoms of hallucination . Well , he 's certainly not normal , not even for Blake . Let 's find out . Come on , Cally . Distant Voice : Renounce , renounce ... No , never . The cause of freedom ... - False , an illusion . - No . Freedom . The right to free , the right ... - The right course is Federation . - Federation ? . No , the right ... right ! Cally , what 's wrong ? . - Renounce dissidence . Renounce Freedom Party . - Renounce . - Renounce dissidence . - Renounce . - Renounce Freedom Party . - Renounce . - Blake . - Renounce ! - Easy , easy ! - Renounce ! - T ranquiliser pack ! - Renounce ! No more nightmares . You can sleep now . You could follow more of that than I could , yes ? . Well , the dreams seem to involve some sort of persuasion process . Another name for it is indoctrination . It 's enough to give anyone nightmares . - " Renounce , renounce ... " - Also something about a " Freedom Party " . Well , that 's what they called themselves , the group that Blake joined up with . And then he did renounce them . But not before he had been subjected to the brainwashing that he is now experiencing in his dreams . But what 's this got to do with the asteroid ? . He wasn 't asleep when he rerouted us . Maybe that 's not related . Well , Jenna , remember there was something else , earlier , in the rest room . - Complaining of some sort of noise . - A sort of tone , he said . - Oscillating . It was there again just now . - As a part of his nightmare ? . - Yes , I think so . - And he heard it just before he rerouted us , right ? . Zen . What are you doing ? . If the tone is in some way related to the dream , we must change course back to Del Ten . - No , Avon , try Orac first . - For ? . A fuller diagnosis . - This is the sensor link - What now ? . Wait for the tone . Switching into audio . [ SENSOR TONE ] - Is that it , the tone ? . - Yes . Orac , what do you make of it ? . Records show audio frequencies related to this range are commonly used by crimino-therapists . Of course , as trigger signals for hypnotic states , used to condition convicted offenders for memory revision . And they would hypnotise them with a combination of drugs and one of these trigger signals . After a little while , a few days , they would no longer need the drugs , the signal itself would be sufficient to keep them under . So could Blake be somehow hypnotising himself ? . He goes to sleep , he dreams , he hears the tone , and and then he awakens under the influence . It doesn 't make for the most dependable of leaders , does it ? . Random course changes to random asteroids . Orac , can this trigger signal be cancelled out ? . - Emergency treatment data recommends dual therapy . - Dual ? . - Of course , with another human being . - What ? . Who must remain conscious so as to monitor approximation to stress threshold . - You , Cally . - Very well . - Suggest Jenna . - Me ? . Why me ? . - Closer origims . - Well , I 'm not all that alien . Come over here , Jenna . Heartless calculator . - That 's just the problem : no heart . - Put your head back . Don 't I even get a tranquilliser pad ? . The object of this exercise is that you remain conscious . Then you can tell us when he is getting near . - Getting near what ? . - Threshold . - Of insanity you mean . - Don 't overreact . - Remember , this is for your beloved leader . - I hope Blake appreciates this . Renounce . Renounce ! Renounce what ? Tell us what . - Freedom . Freedom Party . - Your party . You formed the Freedom Party . - No . Guilty . Guilty . - Guilty to all charges Sentenced to confinement , penal colony Cygnus Alpha , for life . Life ... No . Must speak , must listen to me . False . False ! False what ? False evidence ? False trial ? False verdict ? - No . Guilty . - Not as charged . You must believe that , Blake . Believe your innocence . - Guilty . - No . Conditioned under hypnosis . No . No ! Yes , Blake . Standard hypnoticprocedure , audio pulse signals with visual support ... - False . - ... diminishing your control to wipe out memory . No . Renounce . False . Renounce . False ! - Not false . Standard hypnoticprocedure . - What are you doing ? . Stop it ! - Help me pull him back . - You 've all gone mad . Stop it . - T ranquilliser pad . - There , Vila . A hypnoticillusion to eradicate memory . I repeat , a hypnoticillusion to eradicate memory . That inspired intrusion of yours could have sent them over the edge . - They already were by the sound of them . - Orac , any progress ? . Conditioning deeply implanted . Abreaction commenced but interrupted . - Prognosis ? . - Requires minimum of two hours eradication therapy . Maximum five-minute treatment periods interspersed with one-hour rest periods . Hence , minimum rehabilitation period of twenty-six hours . Oh , no ... One thing . We restrain him before we try again . Right , Orac ? . Agreed . Restrainers recommended for subject 's safety . Plus , constant supervision . Zen , abort course for asteroid PK-1 1 8 and resume course for planet Del - 1 0 . Confirm with arrival time . Arrival at planet Del-1 0 at Zero four five plus one . - What is wrong with him ? . - Space fatigue . Related to the brainwashing they gave him before his trial . Nasty . Especially for those privileged to share his nightmare trip with him . - I think a hot drink and a rest . - Until it 's time for the next bout ? . - You stay here and keep watch . - You 're in charge now , are you ? . Can you think of anyone more suitable ? . Yourself , perhaps ? . And why not ? . I 'm as good as you are . Better probably . Blake , you want some water ? . More ? . - Got us back on course for Del-1 0 , have they ? . - That 's right . Not just yet . You know what 's happening , don 't you ? . - Happening ? . - Avon and Cally . - What about them ? . - Paired up . Mutual affinities . - You mean .. ? . - Oh , it 's been going on for some time now . - I didn 't realise it had gone as far as this . - As what ? . Well , why do you think they 're so keen to get us to Del-1 0 ? . - The Vita particles . - Who said ? . - Well , you did . - No , AVON said . I didn 't want to resist him , block him or it . Arouse his suspicion . - I needed time to form a counter plan . - What are you saying ? . Our only hope is this asteroid . Correction , our nearest hope . - But you 're suggesting ... - Oh , betrayal , treachery , piracy , call it what you will . That is what Avon and Cally are up to . - And Jenna ? . - No , not Jenna . - I think she was probably duped by the other two . - How ? . - Space fatigue , is that what they 're saying ? . - Yeah . It 's obvious , isn 't it ? . They gave me some form of drug , and then put on a show for you and her . Wow ... Avon has been excluding me a bit lately . It 's nothing to what he 'll do when they get to Del-1 0 . - What ? . - He might allow you to stay on afterwards . He 'd be stupid to reduce his manpower more than absolutely necessary . Well , what do we do ? . The first thing to do is to resume course for that asteroid . - Right . - One more thing , Vila . Oh yes , sorry . Thank you . Asteroid PK-1 1 8 . Right . Zen , abort course for Del-1 0 . Resume course for asteroid PK-1 1 8 . Confirm with arrival time . Arrival asteroid PK-1 18 at 1 9i08 . Just over half an hour . Blake ? . - The power 's changed . - Meteorite storm . I 'll go and check . Blake ! Blake ! - Blake , listen .. - What are you up to ? . There 's no other way , Vila . You must understand that he will stop at nothing . Blake , open the door ! Vila , stop him . Blake ! That 'll teach ' em to pair up on the quiet . Can 't blame them for being human , Vila . How long before destination ? . - Just on thirty minutes . - Right . We must be getting near that asteroid by now . But why there ? . What is it that 's drawing him to this particular asteroid ? . It has to be somehow related to the dream . That hypnotic trigger pulse . - But how ? . - Artificial telepath transmission . - You mean controlled beaming . - Yes . On Auron , we had a project group working on it . Before I left , two of the group completely disappeared . It was thought they might have sold their information to the Federation . Could it have been perfected by now ? . Possibly . At least for the transmission of a basic signal . - Like an oscillating pulse tone . - Yes , that could be used as a hypnotic trigger . Destination imminent . Prepare for orbit . Ready for teleport , Blake ? . Blake ? . Yes , but leaving them trapped . Only for a few days . Bring them to their senses . But on a deserted asteroid , Blake . I don 't like it . I am going down there to check that the life support systems are functional . Well , I just hope you 're right . I can see the mine head now . I 'm moving towards it , Vila . Blake ? . What 's happening down there , Blake ? . Gravity 's very low . Cover the ground fast , if you can keep your feet . - Predictably barren . - Wretched mining companies . No sense of aesthetics . - What do you want them to do , landscape ? . - Well , they could make an effort . The point is , if there is a telepathic transmitter , there must be someone down there to operate it . Standard mine head layout . Pit shaft , ore extraction plant , roboticmaintenance , living accommodation . Airlock 's still functional . Entering living accommodation for checks . It m ust have a functional power source then . It 's only a couple of years since it was abandoned . Under terms of the interplanetary mining agreement , the company was bound by law to leave fuel and other ... - Blake , you all right ? . - It 's an odd thing , Vila . The air system ' s already on . Light too , and the artificial gravity field . Blake that must mean there 's someone there . Mutants or ... Blake ? . Blake ! Blake . Come in , Blake ! Not reading you . Blake ? . You read me , Blake ? . I 'm gonna have to get the others to help . You realise this ? . Ahhhhh . Is he come ? . - Vila , Vila , can you hear me ? . - Yes . - Is Blake still aboard ? . - No , he 's teleported down and he 's broken contact . This is some kind of federation trap . - Get us out of here . - I 'm trying to . Let me see him . Welcome at last . - Blake ... is it Blake ? . - It is he . Brother . - And then he just stopped talking . - Why don 't you follow his example ? . - Cally , get a teleport fix to the inside of that airlock . - Right . - That 's the Emblem of Liberty . - Our cause . - Yours ? . I thought the cause of liberty ... - He must conserve his strength . The mind , still sharp , but the physique , as you see ... - Who are you ? . - He is Shivan , defender of truth . Shivan ? . We thought he 'd been killed in a Federation trap . A vile betrayal , and all but fatal . I managed to get him to the therapists in Outer Gaul . He lives now only to see the fulfilment of his cause . To strive ... as brothers - It 's two years since we met . Ven Glynd . - In a Federation court as I remember . - The Arbiter General has defected . - What ? . - In the name of justice . - Yours , or the Federation 's ? . Humanity 's . Oh , you 're quite right to doubt me . A participant in that mockery of a trial . But I had to bide my time . And now , with your coming , the time is right . - All set ? . - Yes , go ahead . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Down and safe . Be ready in case you have to pull us back . - I just hope Avon and Jenna are all right . - Why did you do it , Vila ? . - What ? . - Let Blake go . - Listen , he said that you and Avon were ... - Vila , are you there ? - Blake . - Release the others . - I have done already , Blake . - I want them down here . - Blake , this is a trap . - No Cally , far from it . This is our salvation . - Blake , listen to me . - Hurry down here and you 'll see . - Blake . Blake ? . - What now ? . Avon ? . Jenna ? . - Shivan ? . But ... - Only a few survived . They managed to save him . - To sustain the flame of liberty . - Some hope of that . Ah , but there is my friend , as never before . Ven Glynd recently defected from the Federation , and with enough evidence to condemn Servalan and her friends to eternity . Ah , but only if we can reach that Governors ' Summit Meeting . Yes , of course , we must teleport immediately . Avon , Jenna , your spare bracelets . Now just a minute , Blake ... We agreed that there would be no access to the Liberator without clearance by Orac . I 'm giving them clearance . Look , we 've been on the run for a long time . What have we achieved ? . Access to Federation ciphers that have been regularly re-coded , a raid on Central , an empty pretence , talk of Star One , talk of an alliance . Talk , talk , talk . Until now . Shivan and his friends , a senior Federation official . A chance . Our first real chance . And , one free of violence and bloodshed . - How do you mean free of violence ? . - His plan is perfect . - Only if we can get to that Governor 's Summit Meeting . - This evidence ... You 'll hear it the moment the Liberator 's on course . Your bracelets . The evidence , my friends . Surveillance report on Supreme Commander Servalan 's attempt , to cheat the Federation of one hundred million credits in return for the supercomputer Orac . Confidential report on your trial , Blake , and the subsequent elimination of your defence lawyer , when he discovered that the evidence against you had been falsified . Need I continue ? . Enough , as I have said , to convict the Terran Administration , and Space Command . Only if you can achieve a fair and honest court hearing . - Which is , to put it mildly , improbable . - Ah , but it isn 't . It isn 't . Listen . - Governor Le Grand of the Outer Gaul region ... - The only sane one amongst them . No , there are others who will follow her lead . The majority , in fact . But not if it means bloodshed . Only if a solid legal case can be presented against the Terran Administration . A case backed up by just such physical evidence as I have here . - Arrival at Atlay Zone at twenty-one fifteen . - All right ? . - Oh , time enough to liase with Governor Le Grand . - This meeting at Atlay ... ? . The annual meeting of all the governors of the Federation . The ideal moment . - But why should they give you a hearing ? . - They will hear Governor Le Grand . She knows to expect this . I would never have risked defection without her personal complicity . Yes , but how precisely did Governor Le Grand assist you in ... We must liase with Le Grand just short of Atlay , and then go in with her delegation . And herald at last the epoch of true freedom . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Supreme Commander ? - Yes ? . - Governor Le Grand of Outer Gaul foryou . - Le Grand ? . Well , well , well ... - Governor . - Supreme Commander Servalan . You wish some service ? . Merely a check on the security arrangements for Atlay . Ah , Yes , the Summit Meeting . Now let me see . That is in the hands of Deputy Commander Galt . Standard procedures . Thank you . Why , your Excellency ? . Have you some counter-information ? . No . Since I 'm chairing the meeting I simply wanted to check in person . Of course . Your renowned attention to detail . - A habit of office . - Quite so . Just as my habit was to suspect some threat of a plot . A plot ? . We have heard rumours , nothing confirmed of course , concerning the rebel Shivan . Shivan ' s still alive ? . Severely incapacitated . A mere shell , in fact . But as we both have learned , while there 's life , there 's threat . A shrewd maxim , Supreme Commander . The fugitive Blake is another . As long as he lives ... if only as a symbol to the malcontents , security is threatened . A theme which , with your permission , of course , I should like to stress at the Atlay meeting . Oh , feel free , Your Excellency . From strength , as we say , to unity . One day , very soon , the crimino-therapists will have their sport with you . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Communications . T ransmit a message using pre-revised ciphers . Message to read , " Behold , the mutants shall wither . " No . Oh please , as a gesture of unity . To his followers , Blake , as evidence of your alliance . I have no need . Is that man really Shivan ? . He could be . A voice scan is incompatible with that tracheal vent . But he conforms with records of size , weight , and gender . In the absence of a cell tissue scan ... What about Ven Glynd ? . Records confirmed his identity . A lso his recent defection from the Federation post of Arbiter General . - So , what is wrong ? . - You deduced it yourself , earlier . I did ? . Space Command has long tried to perfect a course interceptor , attuned to the circuitry of navigational computers and rational coordinators like Zen . The scientists of A uron , however , had the wit to aim for the weaker point . - The human brain . - Correct . A telepathic order was beamed to Blake to force him to reroute to that asteroid . - As you yourself foresaw . - So tell us something new . It is to Blake you should look for the new . What 's that supposed to mean ? . That they are still influencing him ? . - Correct again . - But how ? . A device of that kind would need an enormous power source . - Agreed . But now that they ... - Now that they are close at hand : - low power . Of course . - So it 's here on board . - Right . - What do we do ? . - Locate and destroy it . - And restore Blake to his senses . The two don 't necessarily follow . Intercepting Outer Gaul transporter . Slowing to maintain relative vectors for teleport . At last . Vila , assemble the others for teleport . Just rush over ? . All of us ? . Such humility , Blake . I see I shall have to tutor you in protocol . - But the Governor ... - ... will wish to express her homage . Oh , by all means , send your deputy to escort Her Excellency here . But as for going yourself ... no . Very well . You do the honours , Deputy Leader Vila . I 'll teleport you myself . " Deputy Leader " ? . I like it . Protocol for your puppet , eh ? . - Careful with that . - Your precious box of tricks . - Precious to us all . - But most of all , Glynd , with this . - Leave that , Shivan ! - For you alone , you 're the real master . - Be careful . - The eminence grise . - You imagine I haven 't smelt you out ? . - Sharp of you . You think I am so damn enfeebled as to forget the rules of the game ? . Enthrone your puppet Blake to posture and proclaim whilst you enjoy the real fruits of power . - Governor Le Grand must be greeted . - You still need me , brother . Did I deny it ... " brother " ? . You cannot pretend that it was coincidence that homed us onto that asteroid . They summoned you , Blake . They whistled you up like a service robot . - " They " ? . - I don 't know . Ven Glynd ? . - Yes , Avon ? . - Nothing . Avon ' s just nervous , that 's all . Blake , ready to teleport . Teleporting , Vila . - My homage to you . - Mine to you , Governor . - No . It is to you only . - I don 't understand . Did not the Arbiter General explain ? . For years now , the Arbiter General and I have prepared for this moment . He gathering evidence of the Administration 's infamies , while I lobbied the support of my fellow governors . However , we could not challenge and discredit the Administration until we had found an alternative leadership , capable of uniting all factions . - Well , you , Governor . - No . He who leads must be from Earth . Someone of renowned integrity , someone who has become a legend of hope to the great mass of the oppressed . A messiah . Well , then , Shivan . I welcomed Shivan to Outer Gaul as a fugitive . I also had hopes . But as you see , his strength is spent . But when the Arbiter General acquired the course interceptor from our sympathisers on Auron , and with it the means of contacting you in person , our plans were at last complete . Of course Shivan will be with us to add his support to YOUR authority . Where is he ? . Resting on the flight deck . This way , Governor . - Your Excellency . - NO , Nagu . Here is your true leader . - Of the Federation , perhaps . - Dear Nagu . So , Shivan . I heard word of you from an admirer . None other than Supreme Commander Servalan . She still fears you . You and Blake . " While there 's life there 's threat , " she told me . - A fitting prophecy . - If our destiny is to be fulfilled . Your hand , Shivan . Your hand , Blake . The triumvirate , my friends . Le Grand referred to it as a course interceptor . - Now in the possession of Glynd . - Can you counteract its transmission ? . I have specificprogramming against telepathicinfluence . - So you have . - However , given direct access to its circuitry ... - Oh , well done , Orac ! - Well , go and get it then . If necessary , by force . And as chairman I will of course make the opening address . I shall explain your presence , and call on you to speak . I will indict the Terra Administration , doubtless provoking an uproar . Any attempt to interfere will be countered by my security people . Are you sure they can handle it ? . Why not ? . We have the element of surprise totally on our side . Approaching boundary of Atlay surveillance Zone . Security force walls in operation . Prepare for teleport to Atlay shuttle . - To destiny , my friends . - T o destiny . - One moment . - Avon . Listen to Orac . Just listen . - Your dreams , Blake . - Yes ? . They were stimulated foryou by means of a beamed telepathy transmission . Telepathy ? . What about these people here ? . The Governor and the Arbiter General . Aren 't they real enough for you ? . - Your weapons . - No , Nagu . Our two friends must be convinced without threats of force . No true bid for peace was born from coercion . - Agreed . Only from truth and trust . - All right . Then give us the truth about this so-called course interceptor from Auron . - The Arbiter General will show it to you . - Certainly . That , according to Orac , has direct control over your mind . A device was simply beamed into the circuitry of your navigational computer . In that case you won 't mind leaving it here on the Liberator when you go down to Atlay . - Which we must do without further delay . - You WILL leave it . Why not , it 's already served its purpose in uniting us for the common cause . - Acclaim it for that . - But be careful not to tamper with it . At this close range it could cause serious damage to your computers . - Is that correct , Orac ? . - No , negative . Denied . Incapable of damage . The surest way of protecting Orac from damage is to switch him off . Is that correct , Avon ? . - Leave us the key . - Why ? . Orac 's far too valuable for needless risk . Atlay shuttle on orbit vectors for teleporting . Vila , Jenna . Teleport . Shall we go ? . No , leave me , brother . Go . Go . As well we should . The strain could otherwise have proved excessive . Nagu , you will stay with Shivan . Minister to his needs . - But my place is with you , to protect you . - Others can do that . - My lady , please . - No more delay . We cannot risk a security alert . Repeat , Atlay shuttle on orbit vectors for teleport . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Supreme Commander ? - Yes . - Signal from Deputy Commander Galt . - Yes ? . Reporting Governor Le Grand and deputies embarked on Atlay shuttle . Docking on schedule at conference centre . Acknowledged . Hold all channels open . A tlay shuttle docked at conference centre . - Activate scanners to intercept local transmissions . - Activated . - Security force wall still in operation ? . - Affirmative . - And negative on this . - No controls ? . And no Orac to penetrate it . You 'll find the antechamber comfortable enough . How long you 'll have to wait will depend on the persuasive advocacy of our Arbiter General . With this it shouldn 't take too long . T rying electromagnetic pulses . No . I could try frequency intervention , but ... . What do you want ? . - My ... My lady Le Grand ... - What 's wrong ? . My lady ... - T ravis . - One move , just one move . So much for Blake 's new epoch of peace . - How are you feeling ? . - Excited . - Not without cause . - Your finest hour . - Good luck - To us all . I 'll wait for you in the antechamber , all right ? . Oh , yes , of course . Le Grand and Glynd are traitors . Their futile subversion was monitored from the start by Servalan . It was her idea to send the incapacitated rebel Shivan as a fugitive to Outer Gaul . So you and the Supreme Commander are working together again . - Let 's just say our objectives coincide . - I wonder if the rest of Space Command realise that . To the teleport . Governor Le Grand . You are completely surrounded . If you wish to avoid bloodshed you 'll instruct your bodyguard to put down their weapons . Le Grand , the High Council have been aware of your pathetic plot from the beginning . Our only surprise is that you have come this far without realising how transparent your intentions have been . I repeat , your bodyguard will put down their weapons . Now . [ GUNFIRE ] [ GUNFIRE ] What 's happening ? . Avon , Cally , teleport immediately . Emergency . Cally , Avon , emergency . Teleport . Do you read me ? . [ HIGH-PITCHED WHINE ] Teleport , emergency . I repeat , teleport , emergency . No teleport , Jenna . Not possible . Don 't touch those coordinates . Activate it now . [ HIGH-PITCHED WHINE ] Avon , what are you playing at ? . Bring us up immediately . - No , no , no ... - Blake ! Put me down there . DO IT ! Get Blake up ! - Drop your weapons . - T ravis ! - Come on , Cally , get them up . - Get ready to teleport , now . - Do you read me Jenna ? Get ready to teleport . - No , Cally , stop . No teleport . - Do you read me , Jenna ? - No , Cally , negative . Jenna ! Blake , come on ! You ... not Shivan . Betrayer ! Well , do something ! [ POWER DISCHARGE ] Cally , bring us up now . [ HAMMERING AND DISTANT GUNFIRE ] Are you all right ? . He 's a hard man to rescue when he doesn 't want to be rescued . More to the point , are you yourself ? . What happened ? . Why aren 't we at Del-1 0 ? . What 's going on Avon ? . Why don 't you just say , " Thank you " , nicely ? . What are we all standing around for ? . Or has the Federation disappeared ? . Our problem is to find Star One if you haven 't forgotten . I 'm sorry to have to inform you that he is himself all right .

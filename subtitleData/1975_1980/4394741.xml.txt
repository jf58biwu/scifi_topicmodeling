 ( VEHICLES APPROACHING ) We 've all been in contact with the disease . We might be carriers . Have you been exposed to it ? I 'm sick with it . - Well , that 's all right ... - Now , wait a minute ! Are you armed ? There are guns in the Land Rover , but we 're not carrying any . JOHN : What do you want ? We met some people about 20 miles back . They said there was a man and a boy living here . Is there a boy here ? Why do you want to know ? I 'm looking for my son . Is there a boy here ? Yes . Sorry about the gun . But it 's better to be careful ... Well , can I see him ? Of course , I 'll call him . Peter ! Peter ! He 's up in the woods collecting logs . Hello . ( CHILDREN LAUGHING ) That 's enough . Drink this . Peter and I haven 't moved around much at all . Seemed safer to stay put . What 's it like , generally ? Are things beginning to get organised ? Oh , here and there . A few places . People getting together forming small communes . That 's what we plan on doing eventually , getting a farming commune going . Well , at least that 's Abby 's idea . What about you ? Are you going to stay here ? Oh , for the moment at least . Peter ? When things have settled down a bit , we 'll have a look around and decide who we 'll throw him with . Well , you 're more than welcome to join us . Thanks , I 'll bear it in mind . Shall I take a cup out to her ? No , no . I think she 'd like to be left on her own for a little bit . - I 'll go out to her . - Has she been searching for long ? Yes . On and off ever since it happened . - Thank you very much for the drink . - My pleasure . Hey ! Give me that ! Hey ! Hey ! What 's all this ? There 's some boys about my age at Waterhouse . Waterhouse ? Uh , it 's a big country house , an estate , about 40 miles from here . I 'll show you on the map . Come on , Peter . All right , move it . ( CHILDREN GIGGLING ) Uh , come on , Peter . Go outside and play . That 's a good boy . Come on . Come on , you two . Out you go . LIZZIE : Hey ! Hey , look , the fog 's clearing . Now , uh ... That 's us there , and there 's the house . Ah , is it a settlement ? Yes . In the region of 20 adults . We were there for an hour or so . They said we could stay if we wanted to , but quite frankly , I didn 't like the way they were doing things . Too organised . They were reasonably friendly , - but a bit threatening . - Threatening ? Yes . When we said we were leaving , they told us not to take anything from any of the shops or houses , not to stop and shoot game . We weren 't even allowed to camp anywhere within a radius of 20 miles . Just drive straight out of the area , they said . And that 's what you did ? Well , I had the feeling if we didn 't , they might cut up a bit rough . ( GREG CLICKS TONGUE ) Yeah , well , thanks very much for everything . - I think we ought to be on our way . - Yeah . Well , it 's been nice meeting you . Take care of yourselves . All the best . Thank you very much . ( CHILDREN CHATTERING ) Don 't say anything to Abby about this Waterhouse place . Well , later , perhaps . But let 's let her get over this before we start raising her hopes again . Hmm . GREG : Come on , you lot . In the bus . ( CHILDREN SHOUTING ) You all right ? ( CAR ENGINE STARTING ) - JOHN : Bye-bye . - Bye . JOHN : All the best . Take care . - JENNY : Bye . - Bye . Bye . JENNY : Bye . Bye . JENNY : Come on , bedtime . Hey , come here . Didn 't I tell you to go in the tent ? Go on . Now , you stay there while I get the other one . John . Come on . Come on to sleep . Come on . ( GREG SIGHING ) ( CHILDREN GIGGLING ) JENNY : Snuggle down in your sleeping bag . JENNY : Goodnight , sweetie . CHILDREN : Goodnight ! JENNY : Sleep well . JOHN : You too . Silly , isn 't it ? Going on like this . Searching . I 'll just have to come to terms with the fact that he 's ... Today , when that man called Peter 's name , I was certain . I was sure it was him . And then ... Anyway , tomorrow we look for somewhere to settle . Somewhere permanent . I think that 's the right thing to do . We should have done it before . But while there was a chance , I had to go on looking . Yes , of course . Anyway , now there 's nowhere left to look . Um , I 've made up a bed in the bus . You must be very tired . Yes , I am . Come on then . Thanks for sticking by me , Greg . You told her , didn 't you ? Jenny . You told Abby . What ? What 's happened ? You told Abby about Waterhouse . Now she 's gone off . Now , we agreed we wouldn 't say anything about it . Well , I had to , Greg . She was in an awful state last night . All that chat about coming to terms with the fact that Peter was dead , none of it was true . She 'll never believe that . She 'll damn well have to ! You know the odds against him being alive , millions to one . Millions . Now you 've raised her hopes again . You 've got no right to do that . No , I had no right not to . She has a right to make her own decisions . Yeah , but all you 've managed to do is give her a lot more grief . Well , I still say that she had to know . Then what the hell are we supposed to do ? Just sit around here waiting for her to get back ? Then go traipsing around the country every time she hears about some kid somewhere else . Look . She 's never asked us to go with her , it 's always been our own choice . Oh , all right , all right . I know . Well , at least she 's been the only one with any sense of purpose . Yeah , well , she shouldn 't have just gone off like that . Should have told us . Are we going after her ? What 's the point ? Not likely to catch up with her now . Well , if everything goes all right , she should be back before night . Yeah , and I suppose she knows how to take care of herself . ( GUNSHOT IN THE DISTANCE ) Here he comes ! ( GUN FIRING ) Come on . Kill him ! Halt ! I 've got him . Over here . I 've got him . Sit down . Don 't do that . I said , sit down ... ( MAN GROANING ) ( GUN FIRES ) Come on ! Over here ! This way ! There he goes ! ( GUN FIRING ) Bring him down ! ( MEN CHATTERING ) MAN 2 : Hold him . ( MAN GRUNTING ) MAN 3 : Shoot him . ( GUN FIRING ) ( VEHICLE APPROACHING ) ( BRAKES SQUEALING ) Drive , quickly ! Drive on ! Drive through ! ( ABBY WHIMPERING ) ( MAN THUDDING ) ( GUNS FIRING ) ( CAR WHEEL RATTLING ) You better stop . He must have got a tyre . ( CAR ENGINE STOPS ) Well , that won 't take this any further . - Would you like a cigarette ? - Oh , please . ( BOTH PANTING ) GARLAND : I 'll do it . Thanks . ( ABBY SIGHING ) You know , I thought I 'd given these up . ( GARLAND SIGHING ) Well , what was that all about ? Well , that was the first time they 'd organised a proper search to try and catch me . They did it pretty well , too . They 've had me on the run since dawn . Well , why ? Well , I suppose you could say we don 't see eye to eye about a few things . So , as far as I 'm concerned , we 're at war . War ? Historically , that 's what it 's always been called . Two groups with conflicting ideas who resort to force of arms . That 's war , isn 't it ? Well , how many of you are there ? There seemed to be an awful lot of them . - How many with you ? - Oh , just me . - You 're on your own ? - Hmm . I 'd better get a dressing on this , it 's not particularly deep but it 's rather uncomfortable . I 'll change your wheel and let you get on . There 's no point in hanging about . Have you got a spare ? Oh , it 's in the back somewhere . Doesn 't seem to be one . Never mind . I 'll pick you up another car . There 's plenty of them about . In the meantime , I think we 'd better push off from here . They 're bound to follow us up . You 'll be quite safe at my place , if you don 't mind walking . ( HESITANTLY ) Oh , I don 't know . Some people are expecting me , I should get back . All right . In that case , we 'll make a car the first priority . Oh , incidentally , where were you heading ? A place called Waterhouse . Oh , do you know it ? Yes . What did you want there ? I 'm looking for my son . I heard there were some boys about his age there . Well , I might be able to help you , but I really do think we ought to be pushing off . Those people back there are really very keen to catch me . And seeing you helped me , they won 't be too well disposed towards you either . Now , look . I don 't want to get involved in your war . Well , I 'm afraid you are . Until I can get you out of the district , anyway . Oh , by the way , my name 's Jimmy Garland . Abby Grant . I know this must be very disagreeable for you , but it is exciting , isn 't it ? You really are enjoying it , aren 't you ? Absolutely . Well , he can 't be that far ahead of us . We 'll never find him in that lot . He knows those woods like the back of his hand . Yeah , but he 's wounded now . We keep pushing him , it won 't take long . Even if it takes days , we 're not giving up now . Keep him running . It 's a good snare , this . I get a rabbit practically every day . All right , just hang on here a minute . I 've got something to show you . I 'll just check there 's nobody about . That 's Waterhouse . Oh , isn 't it lovely ? Ancestral home and country seat of the Waterhouse family . Now the property of the 14th earl , James Lord Waterhouse . Or less formally , me . - You mean that 's your house ? - Yes . And you have the title ? Well , it 's perfectly meaningless , of course . And I was the fourth son , I never would have inherited , but ... Well , then , this plague thing and ... Now I 'm the last of the line . Come on . Well , aren 't we going down there ? No . No , I live in somewhat more modest circumstances . You see , the gentlemen we had the tussle with down there have taken over Waterhouse . And I am disputing their right to stay there . That 's ... That 's what my little war is all about . We go this way . - Did you get him ? - No . Knox is still searching . But we 're going out again later . Anything happen here ? Yeah . Betty checked the storage shed . It 's been broken into . Quite a lot of stuff 's missing . - Garland ? - I reckon it must have been . - Last night some time . - Yeah . Well , he won 't be so damn cocky in future . I got a shot at him today and I 'm certain I hit him . Good . We 'll get him this time . Careful . ( CAN RATTLING ) Alarm system . In here . ( LEAVES RUSTLING ) ( ABBY SIGHS ) You 've been living in here ? Yeah . My brothers and I used to use it when we were kids . It was our den . And I 've been living here ever since that lot took over Waterhouse . Look , can I get you something to eat ? Hot drink , perhaps ? Shouldn 't you do something about your leg ? Yes , I 'm going to . I 've got some dressings over here . Can we boil some water ? - Over there . - No , no , I 'll do it . I 'll do it . ( GARLAND GROANS SOFTLY ) Look , I 'm awfully sorry I got you into this situation . Well , I do promise I 'll do my best to find you a vehicle and put you on your way as soon as possible . I 'm not going anywhere until I 've had a chance to see if Peter 's at that house or not . - Oh , yes . Of course . - Let me have a look at that leg . Well , it 's still bleeding . Look , you 'd better take your trousers off . MAN : Knox ? Over here . Eh , the rabbit 's not been dead long . So the snare must have been fairly newly set . None of our people have been setting traps up here . - Not that I know of . - No , then it must be Garland . Well , it makes sense , wouldn 't it ? He would be setting traps - near to where he 's hiding out . - You think we 're near him ? Haven 't had sight nor sound of him in a couple of hours . He 's probably gone to ground somewhere . ( SIGHS ) Yeah , it 'll be getting dark soon . Will we turn it in , then ? No , we keep going . Send Ken back for lanterns and flashlights . If he 's hiding , we 'll find him . If he 's running , we 'll push him . Keep him on the move . Push him . Wear him down . Pass the word . Mmm . That was good . - Brandy ? - ( CHUCKLING ) Yes , please . It 's single year . It 's rather good . I got it from the sellers of Waterhouse on one of my little forays . I must say for a man living in a cave , you seem to do quite well . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , I 've had plenty of practice . And I 've probably spent more nights sleeping rough than I have in bed . I don 't understand . Oh , I used to be one of those " expedition people " . I started at university . Whenever some loony planned a trip in the name of science , I was always the first to sign on . I had done the Sahara and the Congo by the time I was 20 . And then , like all good fourth sons , I went into the army , which was great fun . Always bits of wars going on . And in between we 'd organise little walkabouts . Like what ? The Amazon . ( CHUCKLING ) South America 's an amazing place . You can always dream of a good excuse for taking an expedition there . I 've been there three times . And then there was the Zaire River trip . A polar walk , which I wasn 't too keen on . But wherever white man had not trod before , I was there . ( CHUCKLES ) But my kind were rather running out of world . What do you mean ? ( GREG CLICKS TONGUE ) Well , you 'd scale some unconquered peak , get to the top and like as not find a television camera . Hack your way through darkest jungle and come face to face with a film crew shooting nature pictures . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) There just wasn 't much left . You should have been born 200 years ago . Oh , no . No , now is the time to be alive . Now is the best time of all . Now ? With things as they are ? I 'm made for a time like now . I can use everything I 've learnt , everything I 've been trained for . I couldn 't have invented a better time to be alive . - You really mean it , don 't you ? - Yes . Well , there 's millions of people who have died . Don 't they mean anything to you ? If I 'm being perfectly honest , no . The limit of pain and suffering is what one person endures . Now , that suffering isn 't magnified simply because millions are inflicted with it . And it 's the same with grief . You can 't mourn for a whole world . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I must have shocked you . Oh , no . Well , yes , perhaps you did . It 's just that I hadn 't seen it that way , that 's all . Well , it 's a way of staying sane . And anyway , that ... That world that ended wasn 't one I much cared for . I was a misfit . But now ... Now this is my time . And what are you gonna do with your time ? Take over my house again . Teach others . Lead . What my family 's been doing for generations . Well , people who have taken over your house don 't seem inclined to let you . Oh , well . Good leadership 's always in dispute . That 's a healthy sign . Wouldn 't it be better just to join them ? I mean , do you have to be the leader ? Yes , I suppose you do . ( GARLAND CHUCKLING ) Oh , where are you going ? I 'm going to pick up that car for you . Should be dark enough now . And then in the morning , I 'll try and get you close enough to the house to have a look at the kids . There are about four of them your son 's age . But , I must admit , from that picture you showed me I don 't think he 's amongst them . Perhaps . But I have to know for sure . Of course . Well , you rest up here for a couple of hours and I 'll see you soon . Hmm ? Bye . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) ( FOOTSTEPS ) - Ken ? - Hello ? I 've got some tea . Oh , ta ! Oh , cold tonight . Yes . The others going to stay out all night , you think ? I don 't know . - When you on till ? - Oh , hours yet . BETTY : I suppose I better get back . Don 't go in for a bit . It 's cold . - Is that better ? - I should go back . ( KEN CHUCKLES ) No hurry . ( CANS RATTLING ) ( MOANING ) ( CANS RATTLING ) KNOX : It 's an alarm system . If he heard that , he may decide to make a break for it . Well , one thing 's certain . We must be near his hideout . We could have him this time . Right . You go back . Bring the others . I 'll keep watch here . Tell them to keep quiet and to keep their eyes on the ground . There may be more trip wires . Let 's get in the car . ( BETTY GIGGLING ) ( CAR DOOR CLOSES ) ( CAR ENGINE CRANKING ) ( CAR ENGINE STARTING ) ( BETTY PANTING ) - Garland ? - Must be . Knox will murder me for this . He 'll murder me . - Are they all right ? - Mmm . Lizzie was dreaming and it woke John . They 're worried about Abby . There 's nothing to worry about . Oh , she should have been back ages ago . No , not necessarily . Forty miles ? She 's been gone all day ! She 's had an accident or broken down or something . Or found Peter . And if she found Peter , she wouldn 't come back here . She 'd stay the night . You don 't believe that . Greg , she 's in some sort of trouble , I 'm sure of it . Look , it 's pointless following her now . I think we should just turn in and get some sleep . And as soon as it 's daylight , we 'll make a start . Hmm . ( CAR BRAKES SQUEALING ) ( ABBY MOANS ) Oh , you 're back . Did you get the ... Your boy 's not here . I 'm sorry . Mrs Grant , we must talk . We 'll be more comfortable in here . ( DOOR OPENING ) Am I a prisoner here ? - No . - Then I want to leave . I brought you here ' cause I thought you might be able to help . - I want to go . - That young man , Garland ... - Going to get himself killed . - Isn 't that what you want ? Heavens , no ! What do you think we are here ? Some sort of bandits ? He 's been shot . He 's wounded . My people were trying to take him , they had guns , they got excited and they used them . I didn 't want that . I can 't allow him to go on terrorising us . One man , terrorising ? Yes . He 's acting like a character out of some Boy 's Own adventure story . Well , he 's burned down a barn . He 's driven off our stock . He 's raided our food store three or four times . Some days , he sits up in those woods with a rifle just sniping at any of our people who go out to work in the fields . No , admittedly he 's not shooting to kill , but he 's got them all running scared . He says he wants his house back , that 's all . Oh , no . That 's not all . Mrs Grant , there are now 21 people here . We 've got the beginnings of a good community . We can make this place work and become self-supporting . We laid claim to this estate because it 's essential to our survival and anybody else who would care to join us will be very welcome . - Then ... - But we can 't allow one man to jeopardise it . Then why not allow Garland to join you ? - Let him be the leader if he wants to . - ( CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY ) Oh , yeah . Hmm . Or aren 't you prepared to give that up ? Have you heard his conditions ? - No . - No , right . Well , everybody moves out of the house for a start . They can live in the farms and cottages , he says . They must pay rent in food and services . They 'll owe total allegiance to this house and its laws . He wants his people as his subjects with a right to administer life and death . You said you thought I might help . How ? Well , he obviously trusts you . Talk to him . Make him see sense . Tell him we 'll call a truce if he 'll just discuss things with us . We don 't want a war . - I 'll try . - Thank you . - But how do I contact him again ? - Oh . I think I know Garland 's character well enough by now . If he thinks we 're holding you prisoner , he 'll be contacting us . ( ROOSTER CROWING ) ( BETTY GRUNTING ) I 've searched all around for her . Nothing . What time did she go out ? Anybody know ? - Oh , about 7 : 00 , they reckon . - Yes . Any sign of a struggle ? No . Her basket was by the cabbages . That 's all . - We checked the stables . No sign of her . - Hmm . Well , put the men around the house . The women and children stay inside . ( KNOX SIGHING ) Now you see what we 're up against . He 's crazy . Well , perhaps he 's taken her because you 've got me . ( KNOX SIGHING ) - If he 's harmed her ... - Oh , he wouldn 't . Yes . Well , I have things to see to . Would you stay in the house , please . He 's somewhere up on that hillside . ( CRASHING ) - I 'm going out . - He 'll pick you off just like that . Look , if he was aiming to kill , you three wouldn 't be in here now . Leave it to me . Stay back . Garland ! Garland ! Garland , do you hear me ? Over here . I 'll release the girl when you free Mrs Grant . She can go any time she wants . Look , we must talk . I want to see her . Things can 't go on like this . Ask her to come out . For God 's sake , try and get him to come and talk to us . No harm will come to him . I give you my word . GARLAND : Come on . Abby ! I 'll release the girl when we are safely away from here . No , let him go . - But he 's still holding Betty . - He 's given his word . That 's one thing we can depend on . They said you burned down a barn . That was months ago . Then you did do it . It was before most of the settlers came here . There were plague victims in the house and in some of the cottages . That barn was their funeral pyre . Well , Knox didn 't say that . Well , he wouldn 't , would he ? I probably get the credit , or rather the blame for anything that goes wrong on this estate . Well , there you are . You can be on your way whenever you want . Would you like a cigarette before you go ? They want to talk to you . Try to come to some sort of an agreement . - They know my terms . - Mmm-hmm . That you want run everything . Like some sort of feudal baron . - It 's not quite like that . - Well , that 's what they think . I just want to see Waterhouse functioning again . As a self-supporting estate . People living in the houses , working on the land . It could be a society that worked to the benefit of its weakest and its strongest members . A real life . With you as Lord of the Manor ? I am better equipped and trained to administer the running of an estate than any of them . There would have to be rules , discipline , some arbiter to settle the inevitable quarrels . Yes , I suppose it might sound paternal . But it would always be benevolent . I 'd put as much into that society as anyone else and they 'd all have a say in what went on . Then they haven 't understood you . Just give me a year . And I could guarantee to have that place running to the benefit of anyone who 'll live there . Please . Look , you must talk to them . They think you just want to take over , rule them , like some sort of king . Oh , no . That 's not true . Well then , tell them what you 've planned . Make them understand . Please . Look , Knox swore he wouldn 't harm you . He gave me his word . Let 's go there . Now . All right . But I ought to release that girl first . Oh , she can wait . She 's all right , isn 't she ? Oh , yes . Yes , I left her in that hut down by the river . Oh , well , then , Knox will send someone to fetch her . This is much more important . You are a sort of a one woman United Nations , aren 't you ? ( CAR APPROACHING ) Tell Knox . ( CAR DOOR CLOSING ) ABBY : It 's all right . Knox is in the house . Come in . Jimmy ! ( GARLAND GROANING ) ( MEN GRUNTING ) You get off ! Leave him alone ! ( ABBY PANTING ) You gave me your word ! - KNOX : He had to be stopped . - You promised ! Oh ! To hell with promises . Those are old standards . A man 's word being his bond , contracts , treaties . Mmm ? Things like that don 't apply any more . We just do or say whatever is expedient . There are no Queensbury Rules for survival . He wanted to help . - KNOX : He was trying to destroy us . - That 's not true . Just get out of here , Mrs Grant , will you ? This is our affair . We 'll handle it in our own way . Take her back to where we found her car . - Well , the wheel 's shot up . - That 's her problem . - What are you gonna do to him ? - Take her away ! There 's a lot of people here , Mrs Grant . I have to look after their future and protect them in the best way I know how . You 'll have to put it on yourself . They 'll expect me back . ( SIGHING ) ( CAR DOORS CLOSING ) ( CAR ENGINE STARTING ) ( CAR DRIVING AWAY ) Where are you keeping the girl ? Where is she ? Come on ! Come on ! All right , bring him over here . Right . Now , where is she ? You find her . ( SCOFFING ) You 'll take us to her . One way or another , you 'll take us to her . - ABBY : Jenny ! - Abby ! - What is it , Abby ? What 's happened ? - Oh , thank God you came . - They 'll kill him . - Abby , are you all right ? They 'll kill him . We must do something before it 's too late . - GREG : Come on , Abby . Calm down . - I know they will . Just calm down and try and tell us what happened . Well , those people at Waterhouse . They 've captured a man , they 're going to kill him and it 's all my fault . We must do something . ( KNOX GRUNTING ) Tell us where she is . All right . - All right . - You 'll take us to her ? - Yes . - Yes . Right . On your feet . Come on , move it . You 'll need a place to lock him away . Shall I make one of the cellars secure ? There 's no need . She 's in there . ( KNOX CHUCKLES ) Go on . Try it , why don 't you ? What have you got to lose ? Betty . Betty ? If you 're trying something ... She 's in there . Go and check . ( MAN YELLS ) Now drop it or I 'll blow his head off ! ( GROANING ) Who the hell are you ? - Abby ! - You won 't get away with this . I 'll have everybody out after you before you 've gone half a mile . Shut up and get in the hut . Come on , move . And you . On your feet . ( CAR APPROACHING ) ( WOMEN LAUGHING ) It probably goes without saying , but thank you . How did you manage to find the hut ? Well , you mentioned it and I found it on the map . And then I thought we might exchange the girl for you , but then we saw you coming . So we waited . - Do you think they 'll come after us ? - Oh , no . Not now . Well , I think we 're going to have to mark this place as a kind of badlands on the map . We 're not gonna be very welcome here . Anyway , I don 't think it 's wise for us to hang around . Greg , Jenny . Will you take the kids ? - Well , come on . - No . No , I 'm staying . What ? Well , nothing 's settled yet . The war 's not over . But you know very well that if you stay here , you 'll get killed . Look , I 've told you . Waterhouse is my responsibility . I can 't leave now . Well , shall I see you again ? ( CHUCKLES ) I 'll find you . I 'll come for a visit . Bye . ( CAR ENGINE STARTING )

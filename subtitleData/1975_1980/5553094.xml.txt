A visit of inhabitants of the cosmic abyss ? One way or another , our small country has seen the birth of a miracle - the Zone . We immediately sent troops there . They haven 't come back . Then we surrounded the Zone with police cordons ... Perhaps , that was the right thing to do . Though , I don 't know ... " From an interview with Nobel Prize winner , Professor Wallace . Why did you take my watch ? Where are you going , I 'm asking you ? You gave me your word and I believed you . All right , you 're not thinking about yourself , but what about us ? Did you think about your child ? She 's just getting used to you , and you start it again ! You 've made an old woman of me . You 've ruined my life . Not so loud , you 'll wake up Monkey . I can 't wait for you forever . I 'm going to die ! You wanted to start working ! You 've been promised a normal human work ! I 'll be back soon . You 'll be back to prison ! Though this time you 'll get ten years , not five ! And for ten years you will have neither your Zone , nor anything ! And I 'll be dead in the meantime . Oh God , for me it 's prison everywhere ! - Let me go ! - No ! Let go , I said ! Go ! And may you rot there ! Be damned the day when I met you , bastard ! God himself has cursed you by giving you this child ! And me too , because of you , jerk ! My dear , our world is hopelessly boring . Therefore , there can be no telepathy , or apparitions , or flying saucers , nothing like that . The world is ruled by cast-iron laws , and it 's insufferably boring . Alas , those laws are never violated . They don 't know how to be violated . So don 't even hope for a UFO , that would have been too interesting . And how about the Bermuda Triangle ? You 're not going to deny ... I am . There is no Bermuda Triangle . There 's only Triangle ABC that equals Triangle A-prim , B-prim , C-prim . Do you feel the boredom contained in this assertion ? To live in the Middle Ages was interesting . Every home had its house-spirit , and every church had its God . People were young ! Now every fourth is an old person . It 's so boring , my angel . But you said that the Zone was the product of a superior civilization ... It must be boring , too , all those laws , triangles , and no house spirits , and no God , that 's for certain . Because if God is also a triangle , then I don 't know what to think . It 's for me ! Great ! Goodbye , my dear friend . This lady was so kind as to agree to go with us to the Zone . She 's a very courageous woman . Her name is ... I beg your pardon , your name is ? Are you really a stalker ? Wait ... I 'll explain everything . Go ... What a cretin ! You did get drunk after all . Me ? What do you mean ? I had a drink , like one half of the population does . The other half gets drunk . Including women and children . I just had a drink though . Damn it , what a mess here . Go on , drink . We 've got time . How about a glass for the road ? What do you think ? Take it away . I see . Dry law . Alcoholism is a scourge of mankind . All right , we 'll drink beer . Is he with us ? Never mind , he 'll sober up . He needs to go there , too . Are you really a professor ? If you don 't mind . Then let me introduce myself . My name is ... Your name is Writer . Well . And what is my name ? Yours ? Professor . I see . I 'm a writer , so , naturally , everyone calls me Writer for some reason . - And what do you write about ? - About the readers . Obviously , there 's nothing else one should write about . One should write about nothing at all . And what are you ? A chemist ? A physicist rather . That must be boring , too . Searching for the truth . It 's hiding and you keep searching for it . You dig in one place - eureka ! The nucleus is made of protons . You dig in another - great ! Triangle ABC equals Triangle A-prim , B-prim , C-prim . With me it 's quite different . While I am digging for the truth , so much happens to it that instead of discovering the truth I dig up a heap of , pardon ... I 'd better not name it . You 're lucky ! But imagine some antique pot displayed in a museum . It was used at its time as a receptacle of food leftovers , but now it 's an object of universal admiration for its laconic pattern and unique form . Everyone goes oh ! And ah ! And suddenly it turns out that it 's not antique at all , that some joker has palmed it off on the archeologists just for fun . Strange as it may seem , the admiration dies off . Those connoisseurs ... Is it what you think about all the time ? God forbid ! In fact , I don 't think much . It 's not good for me . It 's impossible to write , thinking all the time of success or failure . Naturlich ! But if no one is going to read me in one hundred years , why the hell should I write at all ? Tell me , Professor , why did you let yourself be mixed up in all this ? What do you need the Zone for ? I 'm a scientist in some sense . But what do you need it for ? You 're an " in " writer . Women must be running after you in flocks . My inspiration has been lost , Professor . I go begging for it . Have you been used up ? What ? Yes , I guess , in a way . Do you hear it ? Our train . - Have you taken the roof off the car ? - Yes , I have . Luger , if I don 't come back , call on my wife . Damn it , I forgot to buy cigarettes . Don 't go back . - Why ? - You must not . - You 're all like this . - Like what ? Believing such nonsense . Well , I 'd better leave it for a rainy day . Are you really a scientist ? Down ! Don 't move ! Go and look , is there anyone there ? Move it , for God 's sake ! There 's no one there . Go to the other exit . Where on earth did you look , Writer ? - You didn 't forget the jerry can ? - No . It 's full . Everything I told you before ... is a lie . I don 't give a damn about inspiration . How would I know the right word for what I want ? How would I know that actually I don 't want what I want ? Or that I actually don 't want what I don 't want ? They are elusive things : The moment we name them , their meaning disappears , melts , dissolves like a jellyfish in the sun . My conscience wants vegetarianism to win over the world . And my subconscious is yearning for a piece ofjuicy meat . But what do I want ? World domination . Quiet ! Why a diesel locomotive in the Zone ? It services the outpost . It won 't go any farther . They don 't like going there . Take your places ! Everybody here ? The guards have arrived . Tell them to turn the TV off . Hurry ! Go look if there 's a trolley on the tracks . What trolley ? Go back , I 'll do it . The jerry can ! Give it to me ! Get rid of your knapsack , it 's hampering you . You may travel light , if you wish , as if going for a stroll . If someone gets hit , don 't shout or rush about . If they see you , they 'll kill you . When everything settles down , crawl back to the outpost . They 'll pick you up in the morning . Can they catch up with us ? They fear it like the plague . Fear what ? Here we are ... home , at last . How quiet it is . This is the quietest place in the world . You 'll see for yourselves . So beautiful here . Not a single soul here . What about us ? Three men can 't spoil the place in one day . Why ? They can . It 's strange that flowers don 't smell . Or have I ... Do you feel anything ? I feel the stench of the bog . No , that 's the river . There 's a river here . There was a flower-bed nearby , but Porcupine had trampled it down . The smell lingered for many years though . Why did he do it ? I don 't know . I asked him why , too . And he said : " You 'll understand later . " I think he just came to hate the Zone . Porcupine , that 's his name ? A nickname , like yours . He had been taking people to the Zone for years , and no one could stop him . He was my teacher . He opened my eyes . He was called Teacher then , not Porcupine . Then something happened to him , something broke in him . Though I think he was punished . Will you help me ? Tie those strips of bandage to the nuts . And I ... will go for a walk . I need to do something ... Don 't go anywhere . Where 's he going ? He wants to be alone , I guess . Why ? Even with the three of us together , I feel weird . A date with the Zone . He 's a stalker . And what does that mean ? You see , being a stalker is some sort of calling . - I thought he 'd be different . - Like what ? Well , you know , the Leather Stockings , Chingachgook sort of things ... His background is even more frightful . Several times in prison , then he was harmed here . He has a mutant daughter , " a victim of the Zone " as they call it . They say she 's got no legs . And what about this Porcupine ? What does it mean , " was punished " ? Or was itjust a figure of speech ? One day Porcupine returned from here and got rich overnight . Fabulously rich . You call it punishment ? A week later he hanged himself . Why ? Quiet ! What was that ? Presumably a meteorite fell down here about twenty years ago . It had burned down the settlement . They searched for this meteorite , but never found it , of course . Why " of course " ? Then people began disappearing here . They came here and never returned . So it was concluded ... that this meteorite was not really a meteorite . At first ... they circled the place with barbed wire to scare off the inquisitive . All this gave rise to rumours that there 's a place in the Zone ... where wishes come true . Naturally , they began to guard the Zone like the apple of their eye . Who knows what kind of wish someone might cherish . What was it if not a meteorite ? I told you , no one knows . And what do you think ? Nothing . Or anything . A message to mankind , as one of my colleagues says . Or a gift . Some gift . Why on earth would they do it ? To make us happy . The flowers are blooming again , but they don 't smell for some reason . Sorry for leaving you two here , but it was too early to go anyway . Did you hear it ? Maybe someone lives here ? Who ? You told me yourself about some tourists camped here when the Zone originated . There 's no one in the Zone and there can 't be . Well , it 's time . How are we going to return ? - They don 't return here . - What do you mean ? We 'll go as we agreed . I 'll show the direction . Any deviation from it is dangerous . The first landmark is that last pole . You go first , Professor . Now you . Try to follow in his footsteps . Oh , my God ! And where are ... Did they remain here like that ? Those people ? Who knows . I remember them packing at the station , getting ready to come here . I was just a boy . We all thought then that somebody wanted to conquer us . You first , Professor . Now you , Writer . Your room is over there . We 'll go this way . Why were you hiking up the price ? It 's so close at hand . Yes , but the hand has to be very long . We don 't have such a hand . Don 't ! Leave it alone ! Don 't touch it ! Don 't touch it , I said ! Are you crazy ? What 's the matter with you ? It 's not the place for leisurely strolls . The Zone wants to be respected . Otherwise it will punish . Don 't you ever try it again ... Have you no tongue or what ? I warned you , didn 't I ? Are we to go there ? Yes . Up , enter it and to the left . Only we are not going this way . We 'll go around . Why ? People don 't go this way . In the Zone , the longer way , the less risk . And to go straight ahead is fatal ? He told you it 's dangerous . - And making a detour 's not dangerous ? - It is . But they don 't go this way . What do I care that they don 't ? What if I take a chance ... Listen , what 's the matter with you ... To go all the way around ! When everything 's so close . Here a risk , there a risk . What the hell ! You 're being very flippant about this . I 'm fed up with all those nuts and bandages . You may do as you wish , but I 'm going . - You 're insane . - It 's you who are ... May I ? The wind is coming up ... Can you feel it ? The grass ... All the more so . What do you mean ? Wait ! Keep your hands off ! Professor be my witness , I didn 't sent you there . You go of your own will . Of my own will . What else ? Nothing . Go . God help you to be lucky . Listen ! Should you notice something , orjust feel something , go back at once , or ... Just don 't throw iron poles at me . Stop ! Don 't move ! - Why did you do it ? - Why did I do what ? - Why did you stop him ? - I thought it was you ... What 's up ? Why did you stop me ? I didn 't stop you . Who did it then ? You ? Who the hell knows ... You 're smart , Mister Shakespeare . To go straight ahead is scary , to go back is embarrassing . So you gave yourself a command . Fear has made you come to your senses . - What ? - Stop it . - Why have you emptied the bottle ? - Stop it , I said ! The Zone is a very complicated system ... of traps , and they 're all deadly . I don 't know what 's going on here in the absence of people , but the moment someone shows up , everything comes into motion . Old traps disappear and new ones emerge . Safe spots become impassable . Now your path is easy , now it 's hopelessly involved . That 's the Zone . It may even seem capricious . But it is what we 've made it with our condition . It happened that people had to stop halfway and go back . Some of them even died on the very threshold of the room . But everything that 's going on here depends not on the Zone , but on us ! So it lets the good ones pass and kills the bad ones ? I don 't know . I think it lets those pass who ... have lost all hope . Not good or bad , but wretched people . But even the most wretched will die if they don 't know how to behave . You have been lucky , itjust warned you . I guess I 'll wait for you here until you come back , made happy . It 's impossible ! I 've got sandwiches , a thermos ... You won 't last even an hour here without me . Besides , one doesn 't return here the way one comes . Anyway , I would prefer ... Then we 're going back right away . I 'll return your money minus a certain sum for the trouble , so to speak ... Have you come to your senses , Professor ? All right . Go on , throw your nut .

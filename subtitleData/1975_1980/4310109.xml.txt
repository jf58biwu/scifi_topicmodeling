 ( Rumbling ) ( Crash ) ( Crash ) ( Crash ) - Velocity 's increasing . - Main scanner . - Intense gravitational forces . - Computer identification . Our velocity readings are off the clock ! All sensor equipment malfunctional . - Paul. you all right ? - Yes. and you ? Check all internal Moonbase systems . - Helena. you all right ? - Everybody ? Regina ? - Dr Mathias . - ' Yes . Commander . ' - How are things down there ? - ' Nothing too serious . ' Get a medical crew to Main Mission . - Alan. you all right ? - Yeah . Check with reconnaissance . see if any of the Eagles are damaged . - Right . - Sandra . I want emergency repair crew on standby . Kano. check all sensors and scanners . Victor ... what the hell hit us ? I have no idea . I just know we 're not where we ought to be . We 've changed our position in space . And she 's not responding to treatment ? - No . - Shock ? Headaches ? Double vision ? We all experienced the same symptoms . And we 're recovering . Except Regina . Her condition seems to be deteriorating . But her condition can be diagnosed . understood . What 's happening to us in space is beyond explanation . Another solar system . Well. well. well . ( Sighs ) Looks as if we 've done a bit of travelling . Some travelling - billions of miles in a matter of seconds . Seconds ? Maybe our sensors can tell us something . - How are the repairs going ? - We 're still working on them . The sensors won 't tell us how we got here . No . but they will tell us what planets are out there . Regina . It 's all right . - I was up there again . - Where ? - There were two Moons ! - Take it easy . Everyone was there - Alan. the Commander. everyone . Must have been a dream . - Of course it was a dream . - Yes . because they 're dead . Alan and the Commander. they 're dead . No ! No. they 're not dead . - No. no . - Regina ! They 're not dead . No . No. they 're not . Isn 't the sun hot today ? Tell me about the sun . Regina . - Artificial gravity ? - Positive . - Velocity instrumentation ? - Not working . - Data systems ? - Activating . - Sensors ? - Repaired and checked . - Meteorite screens ? - Operational and on automatic . - Output link-ups completed . - Link up . You can see she actually has sunburn . She believes she 's living on a planet in open air with sun. wind. trees . Something like deja-vu . You know that feeling of I 've-been-here-before ? - It 's a common enough experience . - No. it 's deeper than that . If it were classic regression I could deal with it . but she 's convinced she 's living another life . Her life on Alpha no longer seems to exist for her . You told here we 're in a new solar system ? No . The only thing she relates to is this fantasy existence . The most troublesome part of it for her is that she 's in mourning . Mourning ? She thinks both you and Alan Carter are dead . Why should this only happen to Regina ? I mean. all of us went through the same experience . I don 't know . I 'm looking for a connection between that experience and her condition . Well. it seems we 've been travelling faster than the speed of light . which means time might be affected . So Regina might be living a past life ... or perhaps even a future life . But ... feeling it now . Commander . - Checked all this ? - It checks out . Computer confirms nine planets around that sun . Aim scanner on the third planet . Kano. see what Computer has to say about the third planet . ( Computer ) ' Third planet . Distance from the sun . 93 million miles . 'Diameter 7.926 miles . 'Axial rotation . 23 hours and 56 minutes . 'Third planet is the third planet of our solar system . 'Planet 's name is Earth . 'Moon velocity easing . 'Moon going into Earth 's orbit . ' ( Paul ) ' Come in . Earth . Moonbase Alpha calling Earth . 'Moonbase Alpha calling Earth . Come in . Earth . ' We 're not receiving you . Earth . Possibly you can hear me . Computer forecasts that we shall re-enter Earth orbit in 45 hours . Gravitational forces compensating steadily . Shock wave conditions not expected . Great . We can take an Eagle down for a look now . We 're getting no response to our signals . Something 's wrong ! Oh. come on . Let 's cut the talking and get going . Damn it ! What is keeping the Commander ? We 've guessed at all kinds of disasters . Mm . And we 're still guessing . We can 't calculate what might have happened to the Earth since the Moon went out of orbit . - ' Still no contact . ' - Keep trying . Open all frequencies and set to automatic . 'Yes. sir . ' Victor. a space phenomenon we don 't understand shifts us billions of light years across space . As incredible as that is . I accept it . But to put us precisely in the exact orbit we occupied around Earth ... ( Sighs ) I know less and less about this universe . Victor . But that 's got to be more than chance . Yes . There 's a logic to it somewhere . John . There is some frame of order . We may make all sorts of blunders . wander off the path now and then . but ultimately ... we belong where we belong . On Earth . - I always peel . Awful. isn 't it ? - It 's not bad . Oh . I hate being ill . I hate being inside so much . - You 're getting better now . - Yes . I think it 's because he 's come back . Who 's come back ? My husband . Your husband ? Yes . Alan . It 's been so long . Why have they been away so long ? You 've been ill and time gets all mixed up . They are back now. aren 't they ? Don 't upset yourself . You want to get better . He is here. isn 't he ? Alan is here. isn 't he ? He is here ? Yes. he is here . Why doesn 't he come to see me ? He will soon . You will ask him ? He will come . Please ask . All right . I 'll bring him to see you . In orbit there 'll be time for reconnaissance . If you go now. and we don 't go into Earth 's orbit. we 'll lose you . - Forever . - Computer confirms entering orbit . Computer can 't even explain why Earth doesn 't answer . That 's another reason why we should go there now . Not until we 're in orbit and have studied the situation . ( Beep ) ( Helena ) ' Alan Carter. please . ' Yes . 'Could you come to the medical unit ? ' I 'm on my way . Go ahead . Alan . While you 're there . get something to cool your blood . ( Bleep ) ( Bleep ) Alan . Alan ! You 're here . You are ! ( Regina ) You 're here . You 're here ! No ... No ... No ! No ! ( Wails ) No ! You 're dead . No. you 're dead ! You 're dead. you 're dead ! No . No ! What the hell was that all about ? I 'm sorry . Alan . She needed to see you and I thought shock might have a positive effect . Me. why me ? You 're the shock . She thinks you 're her husband . Oh . I 'll try to explain it as best I understand it . Regina believes she 's in another place in some future time . - Living in the future ? - Yes . Somehow she thinks of it as her past . This is her world . - Anything . Paul ? - Nothing. sir . Commander. beyond normal radio and magnetic disturbance . there is no source of control signal. none at all . Signal or not. we must tell the people on Alpha the situation . We do know there have been major geological changes on the Earth . - To what extent ? - We 'll soon find out . We 're making a detailed radio map of the surface . Attention. all sections Alpha . This is Commander John Koenig . 'The Moon 's velocity has stabilised 'and we 're moving into a holding orbit around the planet Earth . 'We may shortly activate the first phase of Operation Exodus . 'our reconnaissance probe of the Earth 's surface . 'This is scheduled as soon as the Moon is safely in Earth orbit . ( Echoing ) ' Earth orbit ... Earth orbit ... 'Earth orbit ... Earth orbit . ' ( Screams ) ( Screams ) ( Bleep ) ( Gasps ) Ten seconds . ( Computer ) ' Earth orbit ... 'confirmed . ' Somebody help me . Please . - Regina. please. give that to me . - No . Alan. help me ! Easy . Regina . No ! Give me the gun . ( Screams ) I knew you didn 't die . I knew . No . Leave her . ( Beep ) ( Bleep ) Well. the Earth 's axis has moved between five and six degrees . That much ? Climatic conditions - totally different . I 've got the radio map ready for you . In Europe there 's a completely ice-age climate . Here in North America . large areas of desert . You can see . All these latitudes are just radioactive ash . What about cities ? Civilisations ? Is there anything left of them ? About the only place that looks as if it might be able to support life is this area here . place called Santa Maria . Is there any indication of life ? We just have to hope that some people made it . Regina ? - I thought her condition was mental . - I did. too . Victor . Two brains . ( Paul ) ' Commander . Emergency . Main Mission . ' ( Bleep ) The scanners have just picked it up . Let 's see it close up . Seems we 've found another Moon . ( Beeping ) - That sounds familiar . - It should . It 's our own navigation signal . ( Beeping stops ) Another Moonbase . Somehow we 've caught up with ourselves . - ( Beeping starts ) - Alan. prepare for lift-off . - We 're taking a look at that Moon . - Right . - We have no boarding tube . - Then we 'll have to walk . - Total evacuation . Operation Exodus . - Where to ? ( Commander ) I can guess . How did they ... they die ? Their Eagle crashed on the Moon about five years ago . - They were both killed on impact . - Five years ago ? The space vacuum preserved their bodies . The rest of the Alphans could have made it to Santa Maria . If they 're still alive ... and I believe they are . I think that 's what Regina was trying to tell us all along . Well. we 'll soon find out . Why. are you going down there ? I 'm about to activate the first phase of Operation Exodus . - Wait . John . - Helena. we can 't wait any longer . Please. consider this . You saw what happened to Regina as soon as we came into Earth orbit . It 's possible the closer we get to Earth . - and those other Alphans ... - Our other selves . What happened to Regina could happen to all of us . ( Whistles ) Bigger. please . Run that through. please . Thank you . It 's moving faster . - You gotta be joking . - It is . And it 's closing on us rapidly . If that other Moon keeps up its present speed. we 'll collide with it . - How long ? - 48 hours . That still gives us time for a close look . You 'll have ten hours on the surface . We need 24 for evacuation . Paul. activate phase one . John ... If we don 't leave this Moon . we 'll all perish . Under the circumstances . only you and Alan should go . Your other selves are dead . If our people are to go down . the medical implications have to be studied . Like you . John . I have no alternative but to go . Eagle on course for Santa Maria . ETA . 2200 hours Earth time . 'Good luck . Alan . ' They are going home . ( Koenig sighs ) And heading back into future time . It 's an interesting thought . There are signs of habitation below. sir . 'We 've seen it. too . Looks great . Pick your spot and set her down . ' Well. looks kinda different out there . Good landing . Alan . - All set ? - Yeah . You two check the other end of the settlement . I 'll work down from here . It 's happened . You 've come back . ( Screams ) ( Sandra ) No ! ( Scream ) Kano . Paul . Commander Koenig . ( Victor ) This is the Earth . but not the world we knew . It 's an Earth where perhaps we never existed . Or perhaps we have yet to be born . But apart from us. it 's empty now . A civilisation once flourished here . Another Atlantis. perhaps . There are relics of them everywhere . Where are the rest of the Alpha people ? For economic reasons we had to disperse . They are scattered in groups like ours through the valley . ( Children call ) Hey ! Hello ! Hi . What frightened them ? They 've never seen a living ghost before . They don 't understand . - They look like fine kids . - They are . Our finest achievement . Whose are they ? Sandra 's and Paul 's . Yes. the children are our future and as our situation improves . of course . there will be more . That 's a tremendous challenge . To bring back life to a dead world . Yes . And it was not easy . It meant the total sacrifice of all our resources . Eagles. life-support systems . fuel sources . That was why you couldn 't contact us . Yes. we 've had to use everything to make this place habitable . It seems to be working . Oh. it was a choice . A decision that had to be made at the very beginning . If this community had failed . there could be no going back . I think it was a wise decision . You should know . You made it . There was a terrible phenomenon . like comets fighting in the sky . Regina was affected by it . Six days later she was dead . That was when we came into orbit . Our Regina died. too . Both at the same time . Hardly a coincidence . I was expecting you . Come in. please . I had to see you to talk . Do you understand what 's happening to us ? All I know is that we were the same person once . Somehow we became two different people . And now we 're here in the same time . We have no alternative . We have to come down here . Seeing you was a shock . For both of us . I accept it now . Did you know I married ? Yes . You married John Koenig . There was so much to do . Even after he died . Now that you 're here . - there 's nothing more left for me . - John Koenig ... He 's here. isn 't he ? Don 't be frightened . my time here is finished . No. we could help each other . - It 's my own decision . - You mustn 't die . It 's not death . It 's returning . To you. to myself . And through you finding all those I love . Including John . Goodbye . John . We 'll look after her . John . Commander Koenig . Bring your people down here and what happened to Regina . to Helena. will happen to all of us . We have no choice but to come here . If we don 't evacuate that Moon . we 'll perish . You cannot do it . We have children. a future . We will not let you destroy it . We 'll build in another place . We have what you had to start with . Go back to your own place . There 's nothing for you down here . except destruction . Paul. there 's no time to argue . Let 's get to work . It 's our decision. not theirs . Wait . All of you . Paul is right . You cannot live here . Or anywhere on this planet . If you were to come here . there would be chaos and disaster . We know that Regina died when she confronted herself in her mind . Our Helena died when she confronted herself in the flesh . We are trapped in different times . But when those two Moons collide . time will correct itself . Normality will return . There will be one Moon . one community . one time . You must go back . Back to what ? Certain death ? If you are not back on your own Moon when time does correct itself . you will have nowhere to die . John. take us back . Our place and our time is on Alpha . ( Explosion ) It 's over . We are in different space . I wonder if the others made it . If they survived . Did they ever really exist ?

 'It 's capable ... of so many things . ' Tell me ! Oh ... no . 'Oh ... no ! ' 'The pain ... the pain . 'For always . 'Forever . ' 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' 'Sapphire ? 'Sapphire ? ! ' 'Please , Sapphire , where are you ? ' Good morning ! I fixed the lift , I 'm afraid . I wasn 't going to walk up ! Oh , it 's all right , I haven 't touched your knot . Silver ! Don 't touch it . I 'd be careful if I were you . It 's a capsule from 1,500 years in the future . But of course , you don 't have to take my word for it . - Oh , I believe you . - Good . Steel ? Steel . Where 's Sapphire ? What ? What is it ? I 'll show you . Ah , there you are . What do you mean " know " ? Oh , I just know . She won 't be in there . Not in there . Look , if you know something ... No , no , I know about communications , about machines , that 's all . Um , would you excuse me ? Oh , that 's not the only capsule , by the way . There are two others . Did you know that ? - What exactly are you doing here ? - Me ? Yes , why did they send you ? - I just happened to be passing . - Why ? It has nothing to do with the danger to this planet . Not directly , anyway . But if you were to destroy that capsule , you 'd increase the danger . That 's why they sent you ? To tell me that ? Not exactly . Ah . Some unknown force is doing its best to cause havoc with that capsule . And if I destroy the capsule , I would be assisting that force . If you like , yes . Ah . How is it that you seem to know more than I do ? - Oh , I wouldn 't say that . - I would . - My information was wrong . - No . Not wrong . Incomplete , perhaps , but not wrong . I 'm going to need this . Whatever attacked me is in that capsule on the roof . Something that came with those people from the future . If we 're going to eliminate it , we have to get into that capsule but we are not equipped to enter a place that isn 't there . - We ? - Sapphire and I. Ah ! We cannot enter a structure that does not exist . I was almost destroyed trying and now Sapphire has disappeared . But there must be a way in . Yes , well , actually ... there is . And that 's why I 'm here . 'But there must be a way in . ' 'Yes , well , actually ... there is . 'And that 's why I 'm here . ' - What 's wrong ? - Hm ? Oh , nothing , really , just a sort of echo . - Here , in this room ? - Yes . No . Half in this room , half in my head ... ' ... head , head , head ... ' I don 't hear anything . It 's gone . 'I don 't hear anything ... anything . ' Well , whatever it was ... it 's gone . When can we go in ? As soon as I 've prepared the way . Good , because I need Sapphire back . Oh , quite . I know how you feel . - You do ? - Yes , we ... Well , she 's very attractive . The other two capsules ... where are they located ? You don 't need to worry about them . They don 't matter any more . Urban study group calling rural study group . Anyone there ? - Nothing at all , see ? - And you called them ? I 've been calling them for the past hour . Rural experiment , room four . It could be just a minor breakdown . Remember how they were always going wrong during the preparation course . - We should still see the others . - Not necessarily . We 're seeing that , why not them ? Because they 're all we 've got . Rural experiment , room three , please . If we 're trapped here , they are all we 've got . No one else can help us . The others - they wouldn 't have gone back without us , would they ? No , of course not . It 'll be dark soon , I must see to the child . Yes . Come with me . What 's happened to it ? Look . Eldred ... The child , he 's gone . How can he have gone ? And look . It ... it feels like sand . There was a glass ... a glass of water on that table . - Perhaps you believe me now . - Rothwyn . No . I 'm going to find my child . 'No . ' They have some sort of communications room and we have to find the room that 's directly below it . It 'll be on the same scale . - I saw it , you know . - What ? The inside of the capsule , briefly , before Sapphire disappeared . - Well , can you describe it ? - No . Would you hold that for a moment , please ? Thank you . It was just a glimpse , nothing more . Can 't be helped . Apparently , all three capsules have the same ground plan as this flat . Identical layouts . You 've worked with her a lot , haven 't you ? - Did you hear that ? - Yes . - No , Rothwyn ! - What 's your solution this time ? Do I have another talk to a box on the wall , will that help ? Rothwyn ! Whatever 's happening here , whatever happens to us , nothing is going to harm my child . - Quickly , Rothwyn . - But I know him . Please , Rothwyn ! But I do , I know him . 'No . 'The other hand . ' Are there any more rooms ? Just one . Silver ? Ah . What is this , then ? Success at last . Catch . - This is the one . - Good . 'Steel ? ' What was that ? - I thought I ... - ' Steel ? ' - You did . - ' Sapphire ? 'I 'm in the top floor flat . Where are you ? ' 'I 'm in some kind of communications room 'but I can 't find any controls . ' 'You mean you 're above us in the capsule on the roof ? ' - ' No , I 'm not . ' - ' Where are you ? ' 'I 'm in another capsule , call it capsule number two . ' 'Have you looked in any other rooms there ? ' 'Yes , I 've seen it all . ' 'Does it have a crew ? - ' Sapphire ? ' - ' They 're all dead . ' - So they don 't matter any more . - That 's right . - ' Sapphire . ' - ' Yes ? ' 'Silver is here with me . ' 'Good . ' 'He 's going to get us into the capsule - this one here . ' 'I understand . ' 'Sapphire ? ' - ' Silver ? ' - ' I shall ... ' 'Silver says this is the governing one , 'where the power source lies . ' 'Silver 's right , of course . He always is . ' 'Tell me more about the crew of the second capsule . '

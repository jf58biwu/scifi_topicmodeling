 ( Beeping ) 10 seconds . Three ... two ... one ... zero . Compute . Magnitude within one per cent of last observation . Yasko , I want to know the nature and origin of that explosion . Too far away . The shock wave will hit Alpha in exactly 143.2 seconds . Red alert ! Check emergency life support . Helena , prepare for casualties . Medical , ready Casualty Reception . One minute , 40 . - Launch Eagles . - Launch Eagles . ( Alarm beeping ) One minute ... - Eagle 1 to Command . - ' Yes , Alan ? ' We 're in position . Hold your positions . You 'll be shielded from the blast . 'Yes , Commander . ' We 'll be ready to land as soon as the shock wave is past . 30 seconds . - Rescue teams at stations . - Medical section ready . 20 seconds . Blast procedure ! ( Howling ) Come in , Alpha ... Come in , Moonbase Alpha ! 'Do you read me , Alpha ? 'Come in , Moonbase Alpha ! I 'm not getting any reading . ' Let 's go . - Check the air . - Pressure 's down a little . Safe . ( Alarm beeping ) ( Koenig ) Maya , all right ? Kate , you all right ? Yes , Commander , but my scanner 's taken a beating . - We lost audio contact . - We 're all right , Alan . This time , yes . 'Moonbase Alpha status report . Dr Helena Russell recording . 'It is now 1,288 days since we left Earth 's orbit . 'For a week , we 've been travelling toward explosions of unknown origin . 'They detonate at precise 12-hour intervals . 'As we move closer , each succeeding shock wave is more violent . 'There have been no casualties , but we suffer increasing damage . 'Since we cannot control our course , 'there is no way to take evasive action . ' There it is - the eye of the explosions . ( Helena ) A planet ! ( Maya ) Yes . - But too distant for our sensors . - Except one conclusion . It 's still there . It hasn 't been destroyed . The explosions were only travelling outward . Right . With the exact 12-hour intervals , it 's not a natural phenomenon . Some form of intelligence is responsible . Warning us ... " Stay away . " And if the warnings aren 't heeded ? - Get Eagle 1 ready for lift-off . - Eagle 1 , prepare for launch . - Maya , let 's go . - John ... Be careful . Alan , what 's our ETA at the planet ? 42 minutes , 8.47 seconds . - The computer copies . - Always does . Scanner . ( Koenig ) Magnify . Hmm . It 's ringed by moons . Maya , I want a sensor reading . ( Alan ) An almost perfect circle . Maybe too perfect . The planet 's atmosphere is chlorine gas . Specific gravity - 7.493 . Magnetic coefficient - 047 . Try the moons . Atmosphere - negative . But emitting a high energy potential . Set a course for the nearest moon . Energy level unnaturally high . Heavy metallic concentrations . No evidence of life . ( Alan ) John ... ( Alan ) Some sort of station . Maya ? That 's it - the source of the high energy levels I 'm getting . Alan , take her down . Camera helmet . Decompress . ( Koenig ) ' OK ? 'I 'm at the nearest installation . 'There 's no obvious entrance . What 's it made of , Maya ? ' Well , it appears a platinum tungsten alloy . No reading from interior . I 've found an entrance , operated by weight-sensitive pads . 'Radiation - negative . Life form - negative . 'I 'm going in . Cover me . ' I 'll get a suit on . Atmosphere - negative . There 's some sort of a ... ( Maya ) Commander ! Come in , Commander ! Alan , we 've lost contact ! Decompress . John ... ? John , can you hear me ? - Alan . - Are you all right ? Isn 't everybody after getting hit with 300 or 400 volts ( ? ) What is it ? Some kind of probe . I think we 're being checked out . Basic geometric figures . I think it 's trying to communicate . It 's a star chart . It 's trying to find out where we 're from . Sun ... Mercury ... Venus ... Earth ... Mars ... Hey ! How about that ? ( Hissing ) Hey ! Good old clean air ! ( Electronic shriek ) ( Male voice ) ' Sorry for the delay . 'It took some time to align to your language . ' I 'm Commander John Koenig . This is Alan Carter . 'Welcome . I am Voice Probe 248 . ' I 'd like to talk with someone ... who has authority . 'For what purpose ? ' - We 've a vital matter to discuss . - ' You must be more specific . ' Our base , with all aboard , is heading towards your planet . - Unless we ... - ' Sorry . There is nothing I can do . ' - Let me talk to someone who can ! - ' I am a machine . ' - A computer ? - ' Yes . 'I can perform no independent action without authority . ' - Let me contact your masters . - ' That is not possible . ' ( Koenig ) Why ? 'Intelligent life form on the planet - my masters - 'is not yet in existence . 'I am waiting for the first of them to be born . 'You must leave . You are in great danger . 'You must go immediately . ' ( Koenig ) Not without some answers . - ( Maya ) ' Commander . ' - Yes , Maya ? The energy level is rising to critical . ( Energy crackling ) Let 's get out of here ! ( Koenig ) Maya , decompress . - Here it is . - Alan , get us out of here ! Ignition negative . We 've lost main power . Switch to emergency circuits . Still negative . Impact 's blown the main fuses . Reset . Have power on computer . Sensors operating . Still no juice in the ignition system . Manual start . Link in the solar batteries . Energy level reaching critical . This time ! ( Koenig ) A ring of moons , each with a space station . Let 's assume they 're all building a similar energy . Storing up enormous power in the spheres . - Right . Conclusions ? - It could be like thunderclouds . When the potential 's high enough , discharge it . ( Maya ) The equivalent of a gigantic electrical storm . Lightning arcing between each moon . Producing an energy wave like a thousand H-bombs , radiating a million miles in every direction . Alpha 's moving closer . It 's gonna be totally destroyed . How much time do we have ? Assuming the same 12-hour intervals between explosions ... just under six hours . Alan , take her down . We 're landing on the planet itself . All right , let 's take a look at that surface . I think we 're expected . ( Male voice ) ' Do not be concerned . You are being taken to safety . 'Suitable atmosphere has been arranged . You may leave your ship . 'You may proceed . 'I am Voice Probe 748 . ' We 've met 248 . Some things it told us could use explanation . Your masters , do they have a physical form ? 'Of course . But the atmosphere they breathe is chlorine . 'Your air is as poisonous to them as theirs is to you . ' We understand , but we must speak to them . 'As you were told , the first is not yet reborn . ' You said " reborn " . 'My masters enjoy a unique life cycle . 'They exist for an allotted span and then grow old as you humans do . 'But instead of dying , they enter a chrysalis stage , 'to emerge rejuvenated - 'physically perfect , mentally clean . 'While they are sleeping , they are defenceless . ' The reason for the explosive force field . 'Yes . We are programmed to protect the masters . 'Any potential enemy who enters our space is warned by the explosions . 'If the warning is ignored , 'the subsequent explosions will destroy the transgressors . ' Are they all in this chrysalis stage of existence ? 'There is one - the Guardian keeps watch while the others sleep . ' Could you take us to him ? 'This is one of the centres of rejuvenation . ' Chlorine . - Is this the Guardian ? - ' Yes . But we are too late . 'He is entering the chrysalis . ' - Can he still understand me ? - ' I will translate . ' I 'm Commander John Koenig of Moonbase Alpha . We 're heading directly towards your planet . Unless you stop the next explosion , my base will be destroyed . Are you still translating ? 'Yes . But the answer is ... ' What ? What does it say ? 'The answer is meaningless . ' Will you tell whoever is in this thing ... ? 'The Guardian must enter the rejuvenation chamber . - ' He has become senile . ' - No ! No ! - Alan , get away ! - Our last chance to save Alpha ! ( 748 ) ' You must leave ! ' ( Maya ) That 's chlorine gas ! 'You have broken the atmosphere in the chrysalis . I must compensate . ' Let 's get out of here ! Come on , Maya , out ! ( Coughing ) Alan 's still in there ! ( 748 ) ' I must stabilise the atmosphere . ' Alan ! Alan ! Commander , there 's an animal on the planet Kreno , it lives in high volcanic areas and breathes chlorine . Good , but hurry , he 's got less than a minute . Oh , it 's so difficult to remember . ( Choking ) It needs chlorine ! Open up , please ... unless you want to kill ! ( Choking ) Alan ! ( Koenig ) Hurry , Maya , change back . Change back ! We 'd better get him back to the Eagle . Well , the burns don 't look too serious , what I 'm concerned about is internal damage . He should be taken back to Alpha . In three hours , there 'll be no Alpha . - Maya , can you operate the lasers ? - Of course . I 'm going outside . If I give the order , start blasting ! Those are the chambers containing your masters in chrysalis form ? 'Correct . ' You are programmed to defend them . ( 748 ) ' It supersedes all other functions . ' The Eagle 's lasers are aimed at those chambers . They will fire and destroy them . Stop the next explosion or we start shooting . - ' My logical duty is to stop them . ' - Forget logic ! See desperation . ( Koenig ) I will destroy your dome if I have to . I 'm waiting for your answer . 'Please , be patient . ' ( Coughing ) What 's happening ? I am to fire on voice command , but it prevented the Commander . Well , then fire . ( Koenig ) Hold it , Maya ! Decide ! - Fire ! - ( Woman ) ' Wait ! 'Two of us have been reborn . ' ( Koenig ) Disarm laser ! ( 748 ) ' I 'm sorry it was necessary to do that . ' Where are they ? 'I will lead you . 'Special atmospheric arrangements have been made . ' ( Woman ) You look well-featured , Commander Koenig . ( Second woman ) The word is " handsome " . ( First woman ) Ah , yes - " handsome " . You know my name . ( First woman ) And the predicament of your base and people . ( Second woman ) Your language is a difficult one . It took us nearly an hour to learn it . You must stop the next explosion . ( Second woman ) There is plenty of time to decide . ( First woman ) First we want to talk . There are several matters of interest to discuss . There 's no equivalent in your language for our names . You can call me A. And you can call me B. ( A ) We seek perfection . We enter chrysalis fully grown adults . - After each cycle , we are reborn . - Listen to me ... ( B ) We emerge fully grown adults on a higher level of intelligence , to mould our lives in any way we wish . We repeat that process continually in our search for perfection . Our lives are threatened if you ... ( B ) Ah , yes , we have a choice to make . There is no choice , there 's only one decision . Make it ! ( A ) On what should we base this choice of ours ? Universal decency . ( A ) If I agree to save your base , there will be conditions . What conditions ? ( A ) Does it matter what they are ? Then I decide in your favour . - At least you have MY vote . - I don 't understand . A society that seeks perfection must act democratically . Each has equal rights . I have voted yes . It is up to B. Your decision is clouded by attraction . - Attraction ? - For the Commander . It is obvious and stupid - you want him to stay , to be your ... lover . I may learn to adapt my body to suit his atmosphere . Would that please you , Commander ? Make the decision , the only one you can . I am not swayed by emotion . I vote ... no . A tie . A deadlock . - We must await the deciding vote . - Deciding vote ? Next to be reborn will be the Guardian 's brother , brother to the one your pilot tried to kill . It is very unlikely he will decide in your favour . You will wait here until he is ready to speak to you . ( Fraser ) We 're moving away now . Not far enough . 24 minutes to detonation . - Go to yellow . - Yellow alert ! ( Alarm beeping ) ( Maya ) Alpha 's passing the planet . If the Commander can 't stop the next explosion , Alpha will be destroyed . How long has he got to delay them ? ( Sighs ) If the Commander can delay them for four hours then they 'll be far enough away to withstand the shock waves , but too far away for us to get back . Yeah , and getting further away all the time . ( Alan ) You 'd better check and see how John 's doing . - ( Fraser ) Main outlet closed . - ' Check . ' - Airlock Section D sealed . - ' Check . ' Three seconds ... two ... one ... minus 20 minutes . John ... ( Man ) Commander Koenig . I am the brother of the Guardian you tried to kill . It seems your destiny is in my hands . I understand your need to defend yourselves , but we mean you no harm . ( Koenig ) Please , let us pass in safety . In a few hours , we 'll be gone from your planet . ( Man ) You say you are non-aggressive . Yes . A familiar argument , and yet you have attempted to use violence . Born from desperation . ( Man ) You ask us to drop our guard , but offer no valid reason why we should do so . One - you seek perfection . ( Man ) Yes , we do ... through logical progression ... and , logically , my answer must be no . Please , my decision is irreversible . ( Man ) Commander , you and your companions are free to remain . You will be safe here . ( Koenig ) There are things more precious than safety . Loyalty is better than logic , hope is better than despair ... and creation is better than destruction . I just wanted to tell you that , you seekers of perfection . Alpha 's beyond Eagle 1 's reach . We don 't have enough fuel to catch it . ( A ) To leave now , Commander , would be stupid . You can never get back to your base , which , in any case , is facing certain destruction . I know what I want to do . It 's unanimous . We 're leaving . He said , " Loyalty is better than logic . " So he did . " Hope is better than despair , " creation is better than destruction . " Inexplicable . It is not so inexplicable to me ... now . This is the tricky part . ( Sighs ) For my next trick ... ! ( Rising hum ) Countdown at eight minutes . - ' Come in , Alpha . ' - John ! We 've left the planet . Prepare for detonation . Understood . ( Energy crackling ) Go to red . Red alert ! ( Alarm beeping ) John , what 's your ETA ? 'Negative . ' We don 't have enough fuel . We 're not gonna make it . Understood . John ... I know . Me , too . Patch me into the internal system . One minute , two seconds ... One ... - ( Yasko ) Countdown , minus one . - We 're ready . This is Commander Koenig . 'In less than a minute , another energy wave will hit . 'At this range , Moonbase Alpha may well be destroyed . 'At best , you must assume severe damage and many casualties . 'Let the log show I commend all personnel 'for their courage , fortitude , 'and devotion to duty since we left Earth orbit . 'That is all . ' Ready , John . 'Count down . ' 40 seconds ... 39 ... 38 ... 37 ... ( Yasko ) 25 seconds . Detonation positive . Shock wave will hit us in 10 seconds , Alpha - 18 seconds later . Blast procedure ! Five seconds . What happened ? They limited it , controlled it , stopped it short of destroying us . Check it . They used the explosion to give us enough propulsion to increase our speed to 804 . That 's enough ! We can reach Alpha ! - ( Helena ) ' John , are you all right ? ' - We 're fine . 'The shock wave 's left only minimal damage . What happened ? ' Hope IS better than despair . Creation is better than destruction . - ' John , what happened ? ' - What happened is ... we 're coming home . ( Koenig ) Let 's take a specific case . I ask you for our ETA at the planet and you beat the computer . Because your numerical system is based on 10 . 10 , 100 , 1,000 , 10,000 and so on . And yours is based on the function of an ellipse ? Mmm . So when I 'm working out trajectories , those are just elliptical progressions , simple calculations . Like one plus three plus five divided by two . - 4.5 . - Yes ! I must go . I promised to have lunch with Tony . Wait a minute ! Your system simplifies the process but your answers are in our units . Mmm . Well , there 's a formula to convert back . Look . And you beat the computer every time ! You know , Maya ... Maya ! Hey , Maya ! - Maya ! - I 'm Helena . Remember ? - Oh , er ... hi . - Yeah , hi . Alan 's been telling me about the women on the planet - beautiful and naked , I understand ? Women ? Oh , wait a minute . I could hardly see them . Really ? - Beautiful ... naked ... green ? - Green ? They were ? I didn 't really notice that .

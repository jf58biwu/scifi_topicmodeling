 Something serious ? We 're just handing the fleet over to a bunch of criminals . .. two , one , zero ! There 's not much difference between you and your fellow convicts and us . We all live for the promise of freedom and fear the same death . Muffit ! Come back ! 'There are those who believe 'that life here began out there , 'far across the universe , 'with tribes of humans 'who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians 'or the Toltecs or the Mayans . 'Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man 'who even now fight to survive 'somewhere beyond the heavens . ' 'Launch bay Alpha , stand by to launch fighter probe . ' That man next to you is about to fly up your tailpipe . Cadet Cree ? You come any closer , you 'll melt your front end off . 'Our instructor said to keep tight . ' 'He 's at the base playing 7-11 . ' You are on a deep space probe . It 's not like a simulation . - ' Overheat and you evaporate . ' - Yes , sir . - It was too easy . Too easy . - What was too easy ? Our defeat of the Cylon attack force . Their sudden retreat was too easy . The Galactica was bearing down on them . Yes , so it appeared , didn 't it ? But what 's the truth ? I just have the feeling that we 're being carefully manoeuvred . We 're being herded into this safe passage ahead . Blue Leader to base . Small moon ahead . Can you give us a quick scan ? Base to Blue Leader . Scanner readout coming up . Commander ? - Yes ? - An object in Sector Sigma . - What 's the structure ? - Crystalline elements , table M-1 . - Surface ? - Frozen seas , fields of ice . Blizzard conditions and di-ethene storms . Environment - hostile . Nice place . Want us to orbit the equator ? - ' Stay out of its gravitational pull . ' - Will do . Lock in a holding pattern . Boomer and I will pick up a closer scan . 'Cadet Bow , you 're in command . 'OK , Boomer , let 's go . ' Long-range scan indicates unknown craft approaching . Alert the gun crews . Lens system aligned . Pump system to speed . Pulsar ready to fire . Fire as targets bear . By your command . - Lock on target . - Locked . Shields , Cree , keep visual contact . Don 't cross to the dayside . I 'm picking up a brilliant bead of light , like an eclipse . I 'm checking it out . Fire . 'Bow , get out of there ! ' - Back off ! We 're coming up . - What happened ? 'He was picked off . An energy beam . ' Like a pulsar , only bigger . Much bigger . But we 're out of range . 'Blue Leader to base . We 've lost a ship . We 're coming in . ' Battle stations ! All ships , full stop ! Fighter control reporting . Squadrons standing by . Starbuck 's lost a ship . 'Cree , come in . Shields , where are you ? ' I got them . Just inside critical gravitational pull . Cree , Shields , come back . You can 't go down there . I saw where it came from . I 'm going after it . Do not enter the atmosphere . That 's an order . Both of you , turn back . - ' I 've locked on target . ' - Right behind you . Two fighter craft , Colonial . Entering defence perimeter . I want one of them alive . - We can 't let them go down alone . - ' We won 't see them in the clouds . ' Record the telemetry . We can see what they 're after . I got their visual . 'What is it ? ' Fire . - Shields ! - Too late . He 's gone . 'I 've lost Cree 's signal too . ' It 's there but it 's being jammed . Invaders , release control of your ship . - Starbuck , they 're forcing me down . - Hang on , kid , we 're coming . Two more fighter craft entering . Destroy them as they come into range . Fire as targets bear . 'We don 't stand a chance against that . ' We have to get back and warn the Galactica . 'Besides , we 'll never spot them with all this jamming . Starbuck ! ' Frack ! Fighter craft retreating . Thank you , Lieutenant . Put up the video scan , please . Good Lord . I have a fix on the scale . The ramparts are 14 metrons high . - Destructive power infinite in 2 hectares . - It could destroy us in a single pulse . Tell that to Cadet Cree ! - Sir . - You did the only correct thing . You returned with these scans . That 's why the Cylons have squeezed us in here . How long until their pursuit force catches us up ? We have too much firepower . They 'll hang back . - They 'll bring up their base ship soon . - Blue Squadron can take out that gun . It would be suicide to send a squadron . You 've seen what it can do . - And we cannot turn back . - No , we cannot . What 's left ? We can send a specialised task force down to the surface , probe for some weakness in their defence , destroy the weapon . Colonel ? Program a computer research for qualified personnel experienced in arctic survival and mountaineering , specialised in heavy demolition . Yes , sir . - What 's your name ? - Corporal Komma , sir . Well , relax , Komma . Incredible . You understand this felgercarb ? From Alpha to Omega . You 're a viper pilot , you understand some of it . At the Academy , if it didn 't have a control stick , I didn 't bother . Is there something you want , Lieutenant ? Captain Apollo and I were touring the tech levels with the new viper pilots . I just thought I 'd take a look in here . The female viper pilots ? Er , I believe they are females , yes . If you 'd like to meet them , they 're in the armament room . I 'll keep an eye on the equipment . I mean , if something flashed red , I could just yell . Nothing can go wrong . It 's doing a search for the task force to go down to the planet . Sure . Go on . - That 's an order . - Well , since you put it that way . - Four specialists and three support . - Lock it in . Commander . Starbuck , you and Boomer take them to the briefing room . - Aye aye , Captain . - Sir . Commander ! There must be some mistake . Most of these are criminals . They 're aboard the prison barge ... You have your orders , Lieutenant . Aye aye , sir . Something serious ? We 're just handing the fleet over to a bunch of criminals . As long as it 's nothing serious . Croft - commander of the snow garrison on the ice planet Kalpa . - Four of ' em raided a Cylon outpost . - There 's nothing illegal about that . Not a military operation . Armed robbery . They plundered a Cylon platinum mine . Wouldn 't surrender the bounty to the Colonial commander . He didn 't go in . He didn 't deserve any part of it . Who are you ? I like to know who I 'm with when I travel with bilge rats . - Viper pilots . Blue Squadron . - Commander Adama 's strike wing . - What 's the drill ? - You 'll find out soon enough . That computer sure knows how to pick ' em . Holy frack . Hey , hey . Wolfe , demolitions expert , snow garrison . A one-man task force . Not real talkative . Thane , an expert in alien environments . When people talk about me , I like to see their eyes . I work with breathing gear , rare gases , chemical blends . I can take you through land , air , fire and water . - Says here you 're in for murder . - Mm . That , too . She looks like she could take us all on , with or without chains . Leda , medic , first-class . An expert in laser wounds and arctic-experienced . - What 's the mission ? - Commander 'll brief you . To have Croft and me in the same place at the same time invites disaster . You don 't like him ? I 'm married to him . And no , I don 't like him . Weee ! A cosy little group . This is one mission I know that you are not going to volunteer for . There 's not much difference between you and your fellow convicts and us . We all live for the promise of freedom and fear the same death . Perhaps it was the chains that made the difference . Am I in full command ? Of the demolition unit , yes . Of the expedition , no . Three warriors will command you . The commander will be Captain Apollo , supported by two fine officers , Lieutenants Boomer and Starbuck . We 've picked up Cylon battlestars approaching on the long-range scan . They should reach our position in 8 or 900 centons . Whether the pulsar is destroyed or not , this fleet will move in exactly 700 centons . Good luck to all of us . I don 't understand how that computer picked you . I pulled a tour on Ice Station Thula , so it makes sense . But you - you get dizzy when your drink 's too cold . I wish you 'd told the Commander that . I 'd like some way to get out ... Hey , er , Giles , what are you doing ? Giles , what are you doing ? Colonel told me to pack up Cree 's personal effects . He 's not dead . You don 't stow a man 's gear until he 's dead ! - And he 's not dead ! - OK , he 's not dead . - Giles , I 'm sorry . - Just forget it , I know how you feel . Hey . Just tell the Commander you 're not qualified for this mission . Boomer ! You talk like I programmed that computer myself . Take him to Vulpa . Wave . Wave . Wave . Wave . Wave . Wave . Wave . You got him trained . - Muffit 's very intelligent for a daggit . - Come here , little monster . Come here ! Hey , Muffit , wanna see Boxey do a trick ? Let me up ! What do you mean ? I won 't let you up ! What a baby . What a baby ! Come here , I have to talk to you . I 'm going away for a while . - We don 't want you to leave us . - It won 't be for long . - Where are you going ? - An ice planet with Starbuck . An ice planet ! Can Muffit and I come ? We 've never seen real snow . Not this time . This is an important mission for the Galactica . - But I 'm a warrior ! - Yes , you are and we need you right here to protect the ship . Your orders are to do as Commander Adama says . - And say my prayers ? - And say your prayers . I have a very special mission for you . You see this medallion ? My father gave this to me when I graduated from the Academy . It 's very important to me . Could you hold on to it ? - Yes , sir ! - Yes , sir . OK , upsy-daisy . I 'll see you later , OK ? Too bad we can 't go on the ice planet , Muffit . - Watch your step ! - I 'm coming through . - Not through here ! - Take your hands off ! Wolfe , break it up ! Haals ! Wolfe ! Wolfe ! Back off . - How is he ? - He 's all right . It 's a temporary paralysis . - What did you use on him ? - Look at this . Don 't touch the switch ! It 's a hand mine . - Don 't use this on your own troops . - We 're not barge lice . - Or grid rats . - We are . We were picked because we 're expendable . Nobody 's expendable . You 're doing a job on the Cylons , not each other . Stow your gear and fasten your harness , we 're on countdown . 'Section 12 . Launch bay Alpha , stand by to launch probe . ' 'Acknowledged . Ready to launch . ' 'Transferring control to probe craft . Launch when ready . ' Entry tracks . - How many ? - Two . Order the patrol to intercept . Engage the pulsar . Pulsar ready to fire . Fire as target is there . Get a navigational fix before we penetrate the cloud . The surface could be pitch black , snow powder , pack ice . - Cylons ! - Dive for the cloud cover ! - They 'll outrun us . - I 'll block for you . This isn 't a fighter . You 'll overload the turbines . Tell that to the Cylons . Fire . Put on your breathing gear ! We 're going down ! Visibility zero ! Surface coming up on the instruments ! Counting down ! Four , three , two , one , zero ! 'We 've lost signals from both ships . ' - No reception ? None ? ! - Not on the viper channel . It 's dead . No lights . Telemetry indicates total destruct . - Who was it ? - Killian . - And the shuttle ? - The emergency channel kicked in . All reds . Telemetry indicates heavy structural damage . We could try on high band . No , maintain silence . We cannot reveal our position . One ship destroyed . One probable . Contact patrol leader . - ' Garrison command to patrol leader . ' - Patrol leader . This is Vulpa . Tracking reports one invader destroyed , one probable . 'The probable dropped into cloud cover , Sector Hekla . ' Search for wreckage . Leave no survivors . No survivors . - Boomer , you OK ? - Yeah . Hit the emergency lights . - Your head . - It 's nothing . Let 's get out ! You did a great job , Starbuck . The landing you always dreamed of , no engine , no instruments . - Grab a light ! - You 're one fine pilot . - How is he ? - It 's just a rap on the head . Look , don 't feel so bad . Anybody else would 've lost it all . - Apollo , get me the medical analyser . - Yeah . - What 's it look like ? - Broken arm , couple of ribs . Some internal bleeding . - Anybody else hurt ? - Yeah . I am . - What 's the matter ? - I 'm lonely . Stay out of my way . And out of my light . - I have work to do . - Don 't waste your time on him . - We 'll have to leave him behind . - We 're not leaving anybody behind ! We 'll see , Captain . We 'll see . It doesn 't look good . She 'll never fly again . Worse , she can 't sustain life . All her systems are purged . Looking on the brighter side , I think the snowram is operable . Let 's get her out so we can move the wounded into her . - He 'll be back . Get everybody out ! - I 'll get the snowram . Everybody , out ! Cylon patrol overhead . I might have expected you to trample me . - I didn 't see you in the dark . - You never did . - I 'll take Voight . Starbuck , help me ! - We 're gonna need the communicator . There 's no time . He 's spotted us . You have 10 microns before he 's back . Muffit . Shh . Boxey . Muffit wanted to see snow . Here he comes ! Get down ! Starbuck ! Get up on top ! Yeee-ha ! - Great shooting , Starbuck ! - Hey . Patrol leader was destroyed . Send out foot patrols . Hunt the survivors down . What are the coordinates of the Battlestar Galactica ? I 'm from the Columbia . The Columbia was destroyed at the peace conference . Peace conference ! You have a nervous system that carries impulses . Impulses from your brain that can be tapped . What is the exact position of the Galactica ? Go rust yourself . Connect his cortex to the brain probe . Begin the probe . Light the other snow lamp . Keep it shielded . Let 's go . - Come on , Wolfe . - You 're going across the mountain ? - We 'll make it . - It 's our chance to make a break . To where ? We 're stuck here . We can hunt , build shelter . We 've been in worse . We can hijack a Cylon transport , run to a sun system . No ! We signed on to blow up that pulsar cannon . You 'd crawl up that mountain to get your rank back . You used to have bite but now you 're toothless . You stay . We 're cutting loose the first chance we get . - Let 's go . We have a lot of loading to do . - All right ! - How are they ? - They 'll survive if we get shelter . Get them into the ram . We 'll rotate riding on top . - Haals and Wolfe go first ! - I 'll freeze to death ! You ride on top . That 's an order ! Let 's go ! - Get over ! - It 's frozen on that side ! - Do it before I push you ! - Take it easy , Wolfe ! Aah ! We 've just lost power . Leda ! Haals , are you OK ? - He 'll be all right . - What happened ? That clumsy warrior shorted out the power cells . - I 'll bet he did . - Stop it ! We got enough trouble . Ah ! We 've got to go on breathers . There 's a di-ethene wave building in this storm . - Are you all right ? - Just a little cold . - What are our chances ? - Depends on how long this storm lasts . - If the di-ethene reaches death point ... - What 's death point ? The air turns to liquid . Muffit ! Come back ! He 'll be all right . Muffit isn 't like us , he can survive di-ethene . - Will he be back ? - He 'll be back . I just hope he doesn 't bring a Cylon patrol back with him . Galactica . They are heading toward the plateau . The Galactica will be moving forward soon . Muffit will find help . At least this storm will cover his tracks . What do you think ... they 're doing to Cree about now ? We 've got 220 ships up there . You 're worried about one pilot ? It 's not just one pilot , it 's a pilot I was responsible for . It 's not your fault , Starbuck . Tell that to Cree . - Oh . - Where are we ? - What is this place ? - I 've never seen anything like it . Muffit , you came back ! Boxey ? - You OK , Dad ? - Yeah , I 'm OK . You are lucky your daggit found our hunting party . You were on Deathpoint Plateau . Nothing survives there . We 're very grateful . - Who are you ? - Simple hunters . Then you 'll return our packs and weapons and we 're free to go ? Go ? Where would you go ? The storm continues . The di-ethene has left you dehydrated . I will see that you receive liquids . Then we will talk of your going . I don 't like the way he said that . How 'd he get over there ? - Water , could we have some water ? - Silence . - The wounded need it . You said ... - I said silence ! - Here is the liquid and some food . - Didn 't we just talk to that guy ? They 're clones . We prefer the name Theta-class life forms . We found the wreckage . And the humans ? They escaped in a snowram . We found it abandoned on the plateau . You hunted them down ? No . Humanoids cannot survive the plateau . You came to destroy the Ravashol pulsar . - Ravashol ? - Dr Ravashol . He is human . A human created that thing for the Cylons ? - If it weren 't for him , we wouldn 't exist . - He is the Father Creator . Is Ravashol God ? I 'd like to meet him . No , he 's not God . Not if he 's with the Cylons . - Why does he work for the Cylons ? - They let him live to create . To create a weapon that destroys other humans . The mountain is filled with Cylons . Even if you could get by them , the pulsar is constructed of magna , practically indestructible . - We have solenite . - Solenite ? Your injured will stay here . They will be tended to . We will guide the rest of you to the village . - And then ? - You will see when you get there . - When are we going to make the break ? - Wolfe , don 't push it . - I just want you to know that I 'm ready . - Where 'd you get that ? It doesn 't matter where I got it . I can use it on the Cylons or anyone else who gets in our way . - Are you OK ? - Yes . Listen . - Have you seen any others like us ? - You mean , humans ? Yes , warriors . Uniformed , you know ? No , you 're the first we 've encountered . Where would the Cylons take a warrior prisoner ? I thought you were concerned about the gun ? Yeah , I am . Just curious . This is the edge of the ice field . We will follow the ravines from here . You are now close to the village . The entrance hatch is at the end of this ravine . Wait here . Tenna , come . You think they 'll turn us in to the Cylons ? No . I don 't know why but no . Warn the others . Starbuck , shh ! Cylon patrol . Pass the word . - Cylon patrol . - Everybody down . Shh . By your command . We have news from our outpost on Arcta . They have encountered fighter craft from the Galactica . Yes . But how did you know ? Why do you suppose I have been gently herding them to this quadrant ? Put out a call for additional base ships . Resume pursuit at flank speed . We have lost many fighter craft in our recent encounters . We do not have enough to overwhelm the Galactica . Adama does not know that . In any case he cannot retreat in our direction with additional base ships coming up . You are correct , of course . Yes . - You have your orders . - By your command . Soon , Adama . Soon . 'And now , the exciting conclusion of Gun On Ice Planet Zero . ' The way is clear now . So you 're not turning us in to the Cylons . No , we hate the Cylons . We are Theta-class life forms , considered by the Cylons to be subhuman . We were created for slave labour . Most of our brothers and sisters are still slaves . But you revolted . - Evidently we are not perfect . - No . Just human . Will you help us destroy the pulsar ? First we must get into the village . Come . This is the entrance to our underground city . This leads to the base of the research station . We must get to the top of that mountain . - There is one who can help . - Who ? Father Creator - Ravashol . - He 's here ? In the village ? - He lives at the base of Mount Hekla . - You 'll take me to him ? - To free my people ? Yes . But first I 'll take your people to safety . The probe that landed on the planet 's surface - it was destroyed ? Not exactly . - Not exactly ? - Control yourself , my friend . You 'll blow a circuit , or I believe you call it a blood vessel . Quite flimsy compared to ... I do not need a lesson in anatomy . Where are our fighters ? Close to the point of no return . Still hectares from the Galactica . Have them attack the Galactica . But they will not have enough fuel to return . That 's suicide . - They 're machines ! - We are all machines . Even you , of a sort . With a probe on the surface and possible survivors , I must push the Galactica forward . Even if they were human pilots , I would give the same order . Yes , I believe you would . By your command . - Cylons are searching the village . - Take the others and hide them . - But where ? - With the children . Hear that , Muffit ? There are children ! - Children ? - We were thought to be sterile . It was a Cylon mandate to maintain the purity of the Theta life form . - But we have been bearing children . - And hiding them ? Yes . Father Creator , please do not call for help . You are not permitted here . Only planners . Father Creator , we are in need of your help . - You 're one of the 5 series . - Yes . Series 5 , Culture 9 . You are not one of mine . You 're a human . Flight Captain Apollo from the Battlestar Galactica . The Galactica is a vessel of war . I have no use for war or violence . You have a strange way of showing it . What 's that on the mountain , a weapon of peace ? It is an energy lens system to transmit intelligence across the galaxy . Your energy lens system has fried two of my fighters and is holding the Colonial fleet at bay until the Cylons can destroy it . Impossible ! My system is maintained by Series 5 Theta life forms . With all reverence , they are whipped if they come near the pulsar . You are wrong ! I make adjustments , repairs , I transmit . My helpers are Series 5 ! Right now your pulsar is manned by Cylons as a weapon of war . A temporary misuse . A temporary abuse . So you know how it 's being used ! I have no control over the use of my creations ! - No responsibility ! - Then who does ? 'Dr Ravashol , permission to enter . ' Cylons ! Behind the research stacks , in the equipment cases . Hide him ! Enter . Why did you keep us waiting ? Would you like me to ruin my work ? These are delicate compounds . - Search . - What do you think you 're doing ? The garrison commander will hear of this . - We have orders to search . - We 'll see about that . This is Dr Ravashol . I want to speak to the command Centurion . 'Dr Ravashol . ' Why is my work being disrupted ? There is a patrol here . We are searching for humans . I know nothing about humans . Please order your Centurions to go so I may continue my work . Only planners are permitted to visit you . He 's here because I need a strong back to move some equipment . Leave Dr Ravashol to his research . Punish the worker clone . He 's here at my orders ! Cylons ! Cylons ! Help ! - This is our chance to go . - We 've more chance on the mountain . Why couldn 't you leave us alone ? If you hadn 't come , all would be peaceful ! We had no choice . The Cylons forced us here . They are out to exterminate every human in the universe . - Even you will go . - They let me live . They understand my work . You want to destroy everything I 've created . Before you came , everything was in its place . - Planners to think , workers to work . - I 've got news for you . Your workers are thinking and breeding . - Impossible . - Tell that to the children they 've hidden . Children ? If you won 't help me to save the lives in the fleet , do it for the Thetas . In a sense , they 're all your children . We 've picked up a Cylon fighter squadron . - How many ? - An attack phalanx . - They 're beginning to press . - Battle stations . Order Blue Squadron to patrol the rear . 'Vector coordinates coded and transferred . 'Launch Bay Alpha , stand by to launch fighter patrol . 'Launch when ready . 'Enemy approaching . 100 microns and closing . ' - Protect the freighters . - Blue Leader , engage . Have our fighters engaged the Galactica ? Yes . But they will not have enough fuel to return . Break off the attack . Baltar , I believe my sound sensor mishears you . I said break off the attack ! It will force Adama to believe ... that we are even closer than we are in actuality . Very clever . A little hard on our troops but very clever . By your command . Why are they withdrawing ? Secure quarters . They 'll be back in packs like wild animals . How long until the landing party completes its mission ? Irrelevant . We must move forward in exactly ... 420 centons , whether they 're successful or not . There are two chambers , one housing the pulsar , the other a small garrison . The only way to destroy it is to jam or reverse the main pump . It 's not easy but it can be done . Here , here and here . Quick , we must hide these humans . He won 't hurt you ! He 's just a daggit ! Where 's Thane ? I don 't know , maybe he got separated . He 's been looking for a chance to make a break . - We 'd better go find him . - Wait . Let us do it . As you can see , strangers are easy to single out here . Come . What is your purpose here ? Just visiting . How many of you are there ? I travel alone . I 've always been a little antisocial . - You are from the Galactica . - Never heard of it . The Cylons have captured one of your party . - I 'll go . - You 're not going anywhere . I need you to scale the mountain . Take me to where they have Thane . - The Cylons will recognise you . - Not if I 'm dressed like a Theta . - All this risk for one man ? - He might betray us . Are you sure it 's Thane you want to save and not the other one ? Who else are you looking for ? It 's a pilot I lost . Just a kid , really . His name 's Cree . If he survived , the Cylons will have him . For his sake , I hope he didn 't . Take him to a cold cell . I will examine his cortex later . No ! No ! No ! How many combat ships in the fleet ? Tough question . There 's so many . How many ? Starbuck ! - Where 's Apollo ? - He is with Ravashol . - Is he safe ? - He is in hiding . Can Ravashol be trusted ? He saved Ser 5-9 from the Cylons . - Looks like they caught you . - Ravashol lied to save me . I prefer being whipped to being killed . In my inner pocket there 's a tape coder . The information you want is recorded in it . Just press that button . We 'd better get back . That 's no way to greet a fellow warrior . I left you in charge . What happened ? Thane 's dead . - But he didn 't betray us . - We got a problem . - Ravashol says ... - Father Creator helped you ? Yes . He says our only chance is a simultaneous attack . One garrison is stationed outside the pulsar , the other on the gun . You 're in charge of taking the garrison . - I won 't let you down . - I 'm counting on it . - Let 's set our timepieces at 200 centons . - Got it . We 'll reach the top and start our attack in exactly 200 centons . The Galactica will be moving forward after that . - For all our sakes , don 't be late . - I 'll be there . One of the clones told me the Cylon fighters are located at the top of the mountain , just behind the pulsar emplacement . When we get there , we grab one ! And go where ? How long before Galactica hunts us down ? The Galactica is the hunted . Adama won 't waste a squadron hunting down three ex-convicts . He knows that ! Why are your sympathies with those who chained you ? The Galactica and the entire fleet are finished . They will be if we don 't knock out that pulsar . Right . They 'll all be destroyed and we 'll be free ! We can find another planet . Starlos isn 't far . We can pick up food and water and fuel . Are you with us , or are you going to turn your back on freedom again ? I could not shoot down a Colonial warrior . Oh , yes , I know - the code , the bloodline . And for all your compassion , they chained you like an animal ! Now is your chance ! Our chance . One last time , my husband . Are you with us ? I 'm with you . Good news . Some of our fighters may have enough fuel to rendezvous with us . Well , at least 30 % . Good . Have them re-engage the Galactica . But Baltar , they just disengaged . Yes ! It will drive Adama crazy . - He 's not the only one . - You said something ? By your command . Enemy closing . 10 microns . - General quarters . - Closing in , five microns . Blue Squadron up . Launch when ready . Activate the laser turrets . Cylon attacking fighters have retreated but Cylon battlestars are entering the quadrant . Our time is up , Colonel . Flank speed ahead ! We 're going right through . By your command . 'Our base ships have arrived and are closing on the Galactica . 'What is the status of the pulsar ? ' - Fully operative . - ' Initiate random firing . 'Sweep the entire corridor . Begin at once . ' By your command . Notify summit station . Random sweeps covering the corridor . Lens system aligned . Pulsar ready to fire . Commence firing . My God . Yes , I read you . Fire . Avalanche ! That 's one I owe you . His leg - he 'll never make it to the top of the mountain . - Can you get him down ? - I think so . - Do it ! - What about the pulsar ? We 'll take it from here . Let 's go ! We 've only got 80 centons left ! Fire . We 're getting within range . The expedition must have failed . They still have 70 centons . Fire . It 's closing . 68 centons . If we 're gonna go ... it 's got to be now ! I 'm with you . There 's nowhere you can go , Wolfe ! There 's a squadron of Cylon fighters the other side of the hill . We 're getting off this piece of ice . There isn 't time ! The Galactica 's passing through the quadrant ! - We 've got to silence that gun ! - I don 't care about the Galactica . The Galactica is the only ship in the galaxy that can protect you . Without us you 're finished ! I don 't think you realise who is finished here . The Cylons won 't rest until we 're all dead . Don 't worry , Captain , we 're gonna make it . - To where ? - Well , now ... that isn 't really going to matter ... to you . Wolfe ! Don 't shoot ! He 'll never make it . He 's not getting away , he 's as good as dead . We 've got to go with him . It 's our only chance . We 're here on a mission - a mission to save the last remains of a once-civilised race . And we 're going to do it ! You understand that ? This mission goes through . Let 's get moving . Time is running out . I 'm putting you in charge . Get us into that pulsar station . We 've only got 62 centons . We 're approaching Cylon scanning range . They 'll have a fix on us at any moment . Commander ... I suggest we let all the ships move at maximum speed . We jeopardise the fleet if we maintain the speed of the slowest ship . Execute . Galactica to all ships . Accelerate to maximum possible speed . Increase interval spacing . And good luck . Where is the Galactica ? 60 centons and closing . 50 centons and closing . Maintain random firing . Fire . Hard to starboard . 42 centons . I 'll be with you as fast as I can . - Where you going ? - To settle a debt . - You 're going to what ? - Don 't wait more than 20 centons . This is the intake for the cooling system . Laser 's inside . We don 't have enough solenite to blow it all up . Ravashol said the key element is the energy exchange pump . If we can wreck it , the gun will overload and blow itself up . Let 's take a look . We 've only got 35 centons to go . I hope Starbuck 's on schedule . The emergency escape hatch . The cold cells where the Cylons hold prisoners are directly below . - There 'll be guards . - It 'll take ' em by surprise . Nobody breaks into prison . - Starbuck ! - Can you walk ? - I can try . - Let 's go . - Where is the Galactica ? - 30 centons and closing . Fire . - Hard to port . - Helm hard to port . - That was close . - Hard to starboard . Commander , we have to turn back . We 'll never make it . 27 centons and closing . Hold on ! They 're using the intakes ! Let 's go ! Hurry up , we 've only got 25 centons . Come on . In here . Wait . Listen ... - You risked your life to save his . - Seemed like a good trade then . You are very courageous . I don 't wish to betray my people but ... But what ? - They will help you destroy the Cylons . - I know . They will not allow you to destroy the pulsar . How will they stop us ? Apollo and the others are setting the charges . I do not know how , only that they will - by whatever means . Let 's talk to your people . That 's the firing station in the middle . It controls the energy pump . - Is that the target ? - Blow that and it overloads . It 'll blow off the top of the mountain . 20 centons . Fire . - Increase spacing between ships . - Yes , sir . Cylon base stars , quadrant Epsilon . Closing rapidly . There 's your answer , Colonel . We can 't turn back . We must move forward . We 'll get through . We must get through . We 'll help you destroy the garrison . The pulsar weapon belongs to us . Keep that gun and the Galactica is blown out of the sky . When news of our revolt reaches a Cylon outpost or base ship , they will come here in their fighters to destroy us . You will have gone . We will be here alone and defenceless unless we have the pulsar to repel them . Can 't you hear it ? The Galactica is the last Colonial battlestar . The fate of an entire race depends on it ! - That is not our concern . - But it is mine . I am a member of that race that is fleeing the Cylon tyranny . Father Creator . It is for our protection that I speak . We will not be subjugated again by machines . - We are not perfect ... - But you are human . More human than I had anticipated . I shall review my notes to see where I went wrong . Those are your brothers out there in space . We have to help them . Destroy the pulsar . I will protect you . - Eight centons to go . - We go now or not at all . All the way or not at all . - We are with you . - Let 's go . How will you protect them ? I didn 't give the Cylons everything I 've created . Five centons . You take the three at the firing station , I 'll take the two at the door . For the glory of Caprica . For once in your life don 't be late , Starbuck . Four centons and closing . Fire . Heads up . Three centons and closing . Commander , we 'll be in range in one centon . Ready ? Now ! Let 's go ! We 're almost out of time ! Croft ! Fire . That was too close . Why haven 't they stopped it ? - The garrison ? - Wiped out . You go ahead . I 'll get Croft . Croft , we 've only got a few microns left . Why would she do that ? Why would she save my life ? Let 's go . Fire . 45 microns and closing . 40 microns , 39 ... What if the blast cuts the cable ? We 'll find out . 33 , 32 , 31 , 30 microns . Time to leave , kids . Let 's go ! - My father ! - I 'm taking you to him , kid . 14 , 13 ... Ten ... Nine ... Eight , seven , six , five , four , three ... Two ... One . Fire . Commander , we 've picked up an explosion on the surface ! A big one ! Can you read position ? The mountain ! They 've done it . They 've done it ! - Secure quarters ! - Normal operations . Send out a rescue unit with full fighter escort . Aye aye , sir . Baltar , I bring grave news . - It cannot be . - I 'm afraid it can . A handful of humans successfully destroyed the Ravashol pulsar . Despite all of your garrisons and squadrons and the biggest weapon in the universe ? But the strategy was yours , Baltar . I recommend we come up with a solid front to explain this debacle to the Imperious Leader . Very well . But I will yet have the last laugh on Adama , mark my words . Don 't I always , Baltar ? I haven 't seen emotion in a long time . It 's good to see it again . - The Cylons will be back . - We 'll take care of them . You may have trouble with your children , they 're getting more and more human . I 'm glad . Peace be with you . May you get to where you 're going . Peace be with you , Father Creator . - Let 's go home ! - Goodbye ! Good luck ! Let 's go home ! Let 's go , Starbuck . Captain , wait . This is the chance of a lifetime . Three versions of the same beautiful woman . - Imagine the possibilities . - I can . - You can ? - Yeah . Another time . Captain ... Bye . Well , you win one , lose one . I just lost all three . 'Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny , 'the last battlestar , Galactica , 'leads a ragtag fugitive fleet 'on a lonely quest - 'a shining planet 'known as Earth . '

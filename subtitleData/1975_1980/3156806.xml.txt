 Two planets ... We 'll be in range to survey the left-hand planet in 24 hours . Too distant for visual analysis but the spectrograph looks promising . Two planets . Be nice to have a choice . unanimously . 'We strike . We strike first before the travelling moon gets any closer . ' Excellent . We 've waited a long time for this . John . The data on the left-hand planet . It 's inhabited . begin contact procedure . 'The moon is approaching strike position . ' I want Satazius programmed for immediate launch . Dione . 'This may be our last chance . 'You must not fail . ' Dione . Ignore it . Touchdown and assault will be as planned . Stand by for launching . Launch . - Satazius on course for the moon . - Check . always on opposing sides . And the remarkable thing is that neither planet is visible to the other . powered object approaching . It 's a ship . Battleship size ! A colossus . Activate defence screens . Put all Eagles on launch pads . Red alert ! Commander . - Good . they 've activated their defence systems . Analyse them and keep monitoring . - Any response from that ship yet ? - No response at all . I 've tried all frequencies . Still no contact . I want every Eagle airborne as soon as possible . sir . I 'm just on my way . but approach it together . Every Eagle to fire simultaneously . sir . ask questions later . they don 't answer . Look at the size of it . It 's got enough firepower to blast us out of existence . Their purpose has got to be aggressive . it soon will be . Are you suggesting we wait to find out ? I can 't risk it . hold . 'Eagle 2 ready for lift-off . ' hold . - Eagle 1 ready for lift-off . Eagle 1 . all Eagles ready for lift-off . Paul . ' move into attack positions . Neutralise all Eagles . after lift-off centre on me above beacon four . I have no lift-off . - What 's going on ? - They can 't get lift-off . stand by for controlled lift-off . No go . All systems check . All the dual systems check . 'All the safety cut-outs are functioning correctly . ' Alan . no lift-off . - Stand by for controlled lift-off . I have no lift-off . ' stand by for controlled lift-off . we can 't get them off . - It 's impossible . All the Eagles ? - What the hell is going on ? - Attack Eagles now out of action . Commander . Gyro-magnetic ratio has an anomalous factor two applied to electron spin . The Landay g-factor expresses ... That 's not what I want . Gyro-magnetic ratio has ... Computer 's going haywire . I 've still no lift-off ! Alan we 're getting some interference It 's affecting Computer . Some kind of ultrasonic magnetic distortion . Coming into range of moon defensive screens . Deactivate . our defensive screens have been deactivated . Fluctuating power loss . Communication systems also down . Base ! you must ... ' can you raise Alan ? - It 's out of my control . I need emergency power in the Medical unit . sir . - It seems to be slowing down . - Do you think they 're landing ? are the communications functioning yet ? how 's the computer ? any change on the screens ? Commander . Holy cow ... Activate scanners . No sign of enemy activity . Activate missile launcher . Lock on target . Everyone down ! Weapons ranged and ready to fire . Stand by . It wasn 't aimed at us . They were firing over us . It 's bombarding the right-hand planet . No response from the Deltan planet yet . They will . pinpoint their firing positions . the one on the right . Those two planets are on opposite sides of their sun . They can 't see each other because of the size of the sun . They can 't fire at each other directly because any missile would be drawn into the sun . right ? Yeah . What the hell have we got ourselves into ? missiles from Delta . - Track them . Commander ! Missile attack planet on the right ! Trajectory ? Delta missiles on random trajectory . The Deltans have not located our position . Perfect . Stand by to fire . all non-essential personnel to deep shelters . All non-essential personnel to the deep shelters . - All Eagles to bunkers . - And you three get down ! range 492 . Deltan missile zeroing in at range 264 . do you read me ? ' Eagle 1 . Are you all right ? eh ? for the moment . prepare for lift-off . Copy . Alan go and take a look at that ship Check for damage . pull out . Copy . I 'm circling the spaceship now . Looks pretty knocked out to me . No signs of life . Alan ! - ' Pull out ! ' - Copy . try and make contact . Maybe we can get through now . test that capsule for any radiation . I don 't like it . Probably some sort of escape craft . Are we gonna let them in ? How else can we find out what 's going on ? Could be dangerous . They didn 't fire their big guns at us when they had the chance . Commander . - Kano ? - No radiation hazard . All clear . open the airlock to Launch Pad 10 . Keep Eagle 1 up there until that capsule 's inside the airlock . I want three security guards on standby . let 's go . three personnel to Launch Pad 10 . Stand ready . You ask sanctuary of us ? Commander . Demand . - Demand ? ! It 's your aggressive actions which have put this base in danger . you 've no rights here . Then I have nothing to say . All right . We 'll escort you back to your escape craft . Take her away . Commander ! I have already demonstrated the power of my ship . We have many ships . We could overwhelm you if you gave us cause . Maybe . But you won 't be around to see it . Take her away . you will destroy any chance of survival for your people . Commander . We used your moon to attack Delta . They will come here seeking revenge . If you want to live ... all of you ... you need my help . You give me no choice . Commander . I 'm the commander of the gunship Satazius . My ship is now inoperable and I am the only survivor . Thank you for taking me in . I could only have lived for a short while . and now we 're in the middle of your war . We were concerned only with using this travelling moon . We calculated your approach and planned a strike against our enemies . We hoped it would be quick and decisive but somehow they anticipated our plans . - They were ready for our attack . - Enemies usually are . You would understand the problems of fighting from either side of our sun We had no direct line to our targets . We had to have a base in space to bring massive firepower to bear . Many years ago we tried to use a passing asteroid . - It was too small for our purposes . - Many years ago ? - How long have you been at war ? - We have always been at war . Alan ? I could have sworn that ship was completely knocked out . isn 't it ? - That escape craft managed it out OK . what 's so bad about that ? I don 't know . 'Commander . sir ? ' Your Eagle will be no match for them ! The Deltan gunships have the same capability as ours . You must not get involved . Involved ? We are involved . Are you suggesting we do nothing ? I must take defensive positions . but my idea of neutrality is not being a sitting duck . Your weapons are useless against that ship . - You must do as I say . - Paul ? sir . ' Commander ? If you will allow me a communications link I will call up reinforcements to protect Alpha . Protect Alpha ? What do you care about Alpha ? they send reinforcements . lady . It 's not our war . Everyone down ! - Your turn next . - Of course . Our people will destroy the enemy gunship . And then send reinforcements to continue ? Missiles from Betha ! They don 't have to miss by much to hit Alpha . - How many are you on Alpha ? - About 300 . - Can your Eagles hold them all ? - Just about . What are you getting at ? What is ... happening to you was never our intention . So you told me . I understand your anger . It 's natural you should blame me . er ... I would like ... to help you . if Alpha is hit they can fly to my planet . We 'd welcome ... all of you You agree ? Missile launch from planet Betha . They 've destroyed the Deltan gunship . Direct hit . We 're back to square one . Dione 's gunship is knocked out and the enemy gunship is destroyed . end of round one . sit and wait for round two ? finally . - How ? - By calling it a draw - and negotiating a cease-fire . - A cease-fire ? You said you wanted to help . A cease-fire would help us . it would help you too . We don 't usually consider such a thing . But our plan for a quick victory relied on the element of surprise . We no longer have that advantage . Our plan has failed . I 'd have to consult my Supreme Command . I can arrange a link to put you in touch with both planets . programme our communications system to link with both planets . Dione will give you the specifics . even if this doesn 't work it 'll be valuable to gain some time . soon we 'll be no use to them . - How long ? - About four hours . Let 's keep them talking . Supreme Commander of the armed forces of the Delta . ' Commander of Moonbase Alpha . 'What do you have to communicate ? ' I 'm responsible for the people here . Through no fault of ours we have become involved in your war . If the fighting continues our lives are in jeopardy . - I ask for a cease-fire . - ' I appreciate your predicament . 'We did not start this war . We were attacked without warning . 'The enemy gunship on your moon had to be destroyed . ' Your gunship came here and was itself destroyed . Heavy losses must have been caused . You have had your revenge . I ask for a cease-fire . 'I will place your request before the Praesidium . ' At least we 're talking . contact your commander . Chief Commissioner of Bethan Defence . 'We are fighting a war . Please be brief . ' I am John Koenig ... - ' I know who you are I 've been listening to your discussions with Commander Talos . ' Then you are aware I 'm asking for a cease-fire ? 'We have been accused of starting this war . We did not . 'Lt was started long before we struck the first blow . 'They were unreasonable . They have always been unreasonable . 'But we are reasonable people . 'You have asked for a cease-fire . We agree to a cease-fire . then we can discuss the terms . ' we would agree to a cease-fire 'if it could be properly supervised . ' We can police the cease-fire . Thanks to our position we can see you both We will give a warning if a ship is launched from either planet . - Is that acceptable ? - ' Not quite . 'albeit they called it a pre-emptive strike . 'We want to launch a second gunship and hold it around our planet . ' - you want a military advantage ? - ' Correct . ' I don 't believe Commissioner Theia will go along with that . we are reasonable people . ' 'You understand that should the Bethans launch a second gunship 'and you fail to inform us we will destroy Alpha . ' do you agree ? John . let 's hope it sticks . At least till we 're out of range . I had my doubts . - Me too . Commander Koenig . - Thank you for your help . It was in all our interests . I would like to renew my offer for your people to live on Betha . you will like us . Our way of life is similar to yours . it still stands . but ... we will have to discuss it . Sandra will show you to her quarters . Commander . Paul ? I want two guards with her at all times . instruct Computer she is to have no access throughout Alpha . - If there is anything you need ... - Thank you . does it control access to and from these quarters ? - Yes . - Then I 'll need one of those . Commander 's orders were that you are to remain here . A prisoner ? normal security procedure . I see . Are you seriously considering her offer ? We can 't afford not to . We might never get a chance like this again . Seems they 're a lot like us ... in many ways . Victor . We 've got an invitation from people like us to a planet like our own . - We can 't ignore it . - Alpha is intact and we 're moving out of range If we commit ourselves there 's no turning back . And we 've only got her word that we 'd be welcome . - It 's a matter of trust . - Oh . Do we trust her ? Guards ! she 's gone ! look ! - Looks as if we 've found Dione . - Yeah . What 's she up to ? There 's only enough air in that thing for an hour or so . She 's making for the gunship . Why ? Dione . - Get me Commissioner Theia . at last we will rid ourselves of the Deltan enemy . Dione . ' The Moonbase is trying to contact us . 'Dione ! We gave our word to supervise this cease-fire . 'What are you up to ? ' but my plan had to be carried out . This is war . We are fighting for our survival . you shouldn 't be . ' - Your gunship was destroyed . - ' Part of my plan . 'After a near miss I detonated prepared charges . - our enemies were deceived . ' - As we were . But why ? ! 'Lt 's simple . We have an active gunship on your moon . 'Lt 's too late for them to get one here so again we have the advantage . ' everything ... to gain time . - All planned ? - All planned . 'one does not behave ... nicely in times of war . ' All weapons ranged . Ready for firing . Firing ... get me through to Talos ! we 've both been tricked ! We thought the gunship was knocked out to put you off your guard again . the gunship will be destroyed and Alpha too . ' I 'm responsible for the lives of innocent people . I 've not broken my word . We 've both been deceived ! 'You are in a position to give me the exact position of the gunship . Give me its coordinates . ' - ' You will cooperate . - We must remain neutral . 'There can be no neutrality . 'The arrival of your moon has upset the military balance of our worlds . 'or the gunship is destroyed . 'The choice is yours . ' Commander . Any attempt to do so and we will train our weapons on Alpha . at this range your destruction is certain . ' Missiles from Delta . On target for Alpha . the casualties ! We can 't take much more ! I 'm coming out there . 'Out ? Out where ? ' To your ship . I 'm coming out there now . you owe me the same option ! I 'm coming out there in a moon buggy alone . 'You would abandon your command ? Your people ? ' I didn 't say that ! What are you trying to say ? Hold it ! I 'm still in command here . Do as I say . you 're cracking up . - I 'm coming out . Don 't do that ! They 've cut him off . Did you turn off the frequency ? Good . I had to make that look real . Tell Technical to stand by for instructions . stand by for instructions . switch on the frequency . 'Cut me off again and I 'll blow your head off ! I 'm coming out ! ' Whether you wish to die on Alpha or the lunar surface is your choice . 'You will not be allowed on board . ' go back . if you stop the bombardment of Delta I 'll go back . ' You would have us give up victory to preserve you and your base ? stop firing . Don 't you understand ? This is total war ! Dione . ' Commander . 'We will soon have destroyed all that remains of the Deltan defence . ' If you return to Alpha you might just survive . missile response from Delta . take cover ! 'Turn back ! ' Missiles from Delta . On target for Alpha ! - How long before impact ? - Two minutes . stop firing ! ' hurry it ! Turn back ! You will not be allowed on board this ship . 'You only have yourself to blame . ' it 's a trap . quick ! Destroy it ! the moon buggy is under the range of our guns . Dione . - NO ! tell them the Bethan gunship is destroyed . tell him to destroy his missiles . Signal ... acknowledged . total waste . perhaps some good 'll come of it . Maybe now they 'll learn how to live together . but think of the cost . sir . sir . Situation ... normal . we 've got five cases of middle ear damage . there 's nothing permanent . We 're lucky . I wonder what life on Dione 's planet would have been like . You feeling regret ? just curious . I 'd rather take my chances wandering through space than be involved in a permanent war . it 's too late now . too late . They 've got their war and we have all of space in which to find a home . Somewhere .

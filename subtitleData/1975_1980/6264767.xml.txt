 Actually , wrong cab ... That was the wrong cab . I want cab number 4-0-4 . Okay , one more for you , 4-0-4 . The market at 7701 El Cajon Blvd . , going up to 88 .

That number is 757 . You want to know how to get there ? From where ? It 'll cost you about $ 6.00 to $ 6.50 , sir . Right on top of the Paramount Hill . North of ... just south of Balboa and Paramount Drive . About $ 6.00 . 6-5-4 . Cancel . I am at a Vons . I 'll take to the right . Can 't stand , uh ...

Mercy Hospital Emergency for Mauricio . 4-4-5 ... Does Billy like his new rattle ? Listen . Isn 't that nice ? Mommy will buy you a new one for your birthday . And we 'll invite all your little friends , won 't we ? Make a patty-cake for mommy . Can you patty-cake for me ? I 'll do it for you . Do the keys . Do the keys . Billy can do it . Billy can go " click click , " can 't he ? Billy can . Don 't put that in your mouth , darling . We 're gonna have lunch in a few minutes . We 'll have carrots , celery , and a little apple juice , all right ? You like that , hmm ? Susan ? Hi ! - Hi ! - How are you ? Look out . Where 'd you disappear to ? Burt and I went up to see his family in Santa Barbara . You could 've at least called . We were worried . I kept trying , but you 're never at home . What do you do with yourself ? I know , Ruth . We 've been so busy . Jack got a raise , and we 're going to move . Really ? Don 't go too far away . Have you found a house yet ? No , I hope we find one soon . I 'm exhausted . Don 't worry , you 'll be moved in before you know it . We 'd better be . Jack and I are tired of looking . And how 's the little fatso ? He 's fine . I was just taking him home for lunch . - Why don 't you come along with us ? - I 'd love to , but I gotta rush . I 'm meeting Burt . Look , let 's get together next week , okay ? But ... but where is he ? No ... Billy ! This is the Codfish calling the Coast Guard station . Coast Guard , what is the weather forecast and prediction ? Uh-huh , all right . Okay , thank you , Coast Guard . Codfish over and out . Hey , watch it ! You 're gonna fall off one of these days ! Hey , did you hear me ? What 's the weather report ? Can we sail tomorrow ? We 'll sail when I 'm through here . - Did you clean that engine ? - No . I wanna get something to eat first . Want a sandwich ? - Not now . - Whatever you say . Don 't you ever think about eating ? Where 'd you get that belly from ? Beer ? Somebody else worries about me . Bill ? Bill ! My God . You 're gonna tell me Rosie White kisses better than I do ? You bet your life she does . And so does Sallie Oppenheimer . Look , even that freaky Melinda Gomez kisses better than you . That creep ? Are you kidding ? She 's a weirdo . But no French kissing , you promise ? You know I can 't control myself . - Ugh ! I hate that ! - What do you mean , you hate it ? You 're hurting me ! I 'll tell all the other guys . You 'll never get another date ! That 's my fishing rod ! It 's Bill . I saw him this morning . He was a man then . That 's a skeleton . What the hell happened to him ? The medical examiner will tell us . In the meantime , let 's not be guessing out loud too much . People are upset enough as it is . So much for talking out loud . Here comes Ned Turner . I was looking at what 's left of the Hopkins baby when they told me there 'd been a second freak accident within the hour . That 's right . Who 's under the tarp ? Bill Sullivan ... I think . May I take a look ? Be my guest . I suggest you take a deep breath first . Jesus H. Christ . Yeah . Stripped to the bone . Yeah . - Skeletons . - Well ? - Well , what ? - Got any answers ? I don 't even know where to start asking questions . That tunnel they 're building in the harbor ... they 're using equipment Buck Rogers couldn 't dream up . Like a big mobile tube that sucks its way right through the ocean floor . Passes up loose rocks and tosses them out behind . Maybe Bill got pulled down into one of them . And the baby ? Yeah , what about the baby ? It wasn 't anyplace near the tunnel site . Christ only knows . Turner , do me a favor , will you ? Don 't play up the sensational stuff when you write your story , huh ? Don 't say , " mysterious circumstances , " and " strange occurrences , " huh ? Just very simple . " Cause of death unknown , " all right ? I mean , we get the rumors started . I 'm gonna have wall to wall people . Then we 'll never get to the bottom of what happened . What happened ? What 's happening . If you want my opinion , we 're in for a nightmare . Ned ? Ned ! Yeah ? What are you doing ? Why are all the lights on ? What did you do , work all night ? Come on , didn 't mama tell you that was bad for your eyes ? And she told you to stay away from candy . What do you mean candy , little brother ? This isn 't candy . It 's passion . And whom did you seduce last night ? Frank Leonetti . You know , the bartender who works where Christine works ? He 's so young and beautiful and so Italian . - Aren 't you ever gonna slow down ? - Never . Oh , maybe when my hair has turned to silver like yours . But that could never happen . Listen , how about a bloody Mary , huh ? No , it 's too late or too early or something . You know ... Frank has got a sister . Frank 's got two sisters . One 's uglier than the other . All right . You know , I was just mentioning it . You know , I 'm not asking you to marry them . Why does it seem as though we had this conversation 40 years ago ? 'Cause we did . We did , in this very house , in this room , behind this sofa , remember ? In whispers , so Ma and Pa wouldn 't hear us ? You suppose they can hear us now ? Maybe . If they can , they 'd be happy because we still try to take care of each other . And after all the marriages and divorces and catastrophes ... we 're still kind of a family . - Ned , did you have a rough night ? - Kind of . What are you working on ? Looking for answers that don 't seem to be in any of those books in there . Yeah ? Answers to what ? What 's happening on that ocean floor . Where 's Tommy ? I haven 't seen him yet . He 's usually about and starving at this hour . You know , I remember when you were just about his age , mama used to say you ate one meal a day all day long , Boy , am I starved ! I 'm gonna make breakfast . No , no , no . You 're not gonna make breakfast . You 'll wreck the kitchen . I 'll do it . Get Corey for me . Corey ? Yes , yes . I know about the test . That 's not what I 'm calling about . Be at my house at 12 : 00 sharp . Yes , today . To hell with the test . Just be here . Why do I have I read about what 's going on in my own company in the morning paper ? Well , Ned Turner was around asking questions , but I didn 't ... What kind of questions ? About our underwater tests . What 's his interest ? Just curiosity , I guess . Something different to write about . Why didn 't you refer him to me ? Because I assumed it was the usual thing . Big city journalist trying to make himself look good by stirring up circulation . Apparently , it 's more than just idle curiosity . Is there any truth to Turner 's insinuations ? No , absolutely not . Doesn 't seem likely he 'd make wild accusations . Turner has a fine reputation . Hell , maybe he 's just getting senile and needs to prove something . How do I know ? Tell you what I don 't need , and that 's anyone in my employ jeopardizing Trojan 's integrity and accomplishments which have taken me a lifetime to achieve . Is that clear ? Yes , sir . - All right , what 's next ? - The skull . Now I 'll show you the torso . There 's barely any cartilage left at the joints to hold the frame together . And inside the bones , even the marrow has been sucked dry . All right , the dental records confirm that this was Bill Sullivan . But how did he die ? For Christ sakes , what did this ? I 'd like to hear the answer to that one . This examination was supposed to be closed to the press . I 'll try not to get in your way . Is that the same condition the baby was in , doctor ? Exactly . But I don 't know of anything that would operate with a vacuum effect of stripping a human being right down to the bone . There must be something monstrous out there , monstrous and infernal . What do you mean " must be " ? Have you suddenly become a marine expert ? No , but I know the best in the country . Well , if you 're talking about Will Gleeson , two of his divers are coming down to check the underwater effects of that tunnel construction . Sound decision , Robards . - Arriving when ? - Sometime tomorrow . May be too late . I don 't like to wait on an official report . I 'm gonna see Gleeson himself . Turner ... I wanna keep the lid on this thing . I won 't put anything into print without your clearing it . Here you go , baby . You want another one ? Hey , come here . Don 't go too easy on her , Mike . You gotta get a little tough sometimes . I 'm sorry , Will . But you 're the only one who can get them to do what you want . Well , you just keep trying . You 'll get the hang of it . Quite a show they put on ! These killer whales may unlock some of the biggest mysteries of the sea we don 't even know about yet . Until then , could you unlock some of the mysteries confronting my community ? Yeah , I heard about that . The Oceanography institute called me yesterday , and so I sent two of my best divers up there to check out the area . I 'm disappointed . You have a reputation for laying your judgments on the line . Or your neck . - Where 'd you get that ? - Time magazine . Tough city kid claws , or rather , swims his way up out of the gutter , not through sports , but on the back of a fish . You make it sound better than they wrote it . Will you help us ? Well ... I 'd like to , but asking me to go in the water now would be like asking those killer whales to fight without their teeth . What does that mean ? Couple months ago , I had a little diving accident . Went down too far and got the bends . I can answer that for you . My wife Vicky . Ned Turner . He 's a reporter . Show him around . Easy , now . Watch out , Jack , or the Marine Commission guys will give us hell . Okay , we 'll try to take care of that . Don 't worry . Slower . Go easy there ! Two fathoms . Four fathoms . Pressure check . Okay , Don , we just ran a check on our pressure . We 're okay . Eight fathoms . Mike , what the hell are the men doing up there ? Hey ! We 're bouncing around in here . Is anything wrong ? Not up here . - Everything 's okay , guys . - 11 fathoms . I wonder why Corey was trying to pay us off so we wouldn 't do this dive . What are you worrying about Corey for , anyway ? 16 . - For Christ sake . - 19 fathoms . Look , if Will sent us down here , he must 've had good reason . So why don 't we get it over with and go down to Mexico over the weekend with those two broads , okay ? - Yeah . - 22 fathoms . 27 fathoms . 29 fathoms . Okay , come on . Don ! Can you hear me ? ! Don , raise her up , will ya ? ! - Anything wrong down there ? - Get this thing up ! Michael ! Come here ! Something went wrong ! What ? ! We 're going to bring you up right now . Let her go ! Don ? Hey ! I couldn 't do a thing to help him ! He was ... sucked right in ! What ? What ? ! We were checking the cables , and all of a sudden ... What the hell 's going on ? Don ! The generator . Hey , what happened ? Come on , get the lead out ! Michael , for Christ sakes , what the hell 's taking so long ? Mr. Corey ! I 'll sit over here . I called you several times today , but your secretary kept telling me you were out . I still am to you . Mind if I join you ? I 'd like to ask a few questions about a possible connection between your tunnel construction and those deaths in the harbor . Scotch on the rocks . Make it double , please . You nervous about something ? Does a man have to be nervous to enjoy a drink ? If he 's not a drinking man . I come in here a lot . It 's the first I 've seen of you . Waiting for someone ? Like who ? Will Gleeson and his wife are supposed to be arriving this afternoon . Turner , there is nothing wrong with that tunnel . And stop sticking your nose into my business . This place is too small for you to keep backing away from me . That drink 's on me , honey . Can 't we have our little talk together ? I would like to enter these two boys in the sailboat race . This is my son Tommy , and this is his best friend Jamie . This pamphlet will explain the rules . And a $ 5.00 registration fee each . - $ 5.00 each ? - Yes . Oh . Here you are . Could I have their names , please ? Yes , Tommy ... Frascati ... I always forget . My second husband was Italian . And this is Jamie ... Docherty . Yes . Docherty . D-O-C-H . Is that right ? D-O-C-H-E-R-T-Y . Yes . And allow enough time to be in Oceanside at least 24 hours before the race . We have to be there 24 hours before the race ? - Yeah . - Oh , please , mommy ? Please , Mrs. Turner ? Okay . All right . Oceanside 's about 50 miles down the coast , isn 't it ? Yes . These are the forms that need to be filled in by their parents giving them authorization . - Yes . All right . - And these are for you . Oh , thank you ! How nice . T-shirts . The only trouble is Jamie 's mother has two jobs , day and night . Can I take the applications to her to have her fill it out , - and I 'll bring it back . - Sure , that 'll be fine . Now you do know the race takes place in open sea ? And we have participants from all over the area . Oh , it 's gonna be a big crowd . We are . Anyway , good luck to you both . I don 't really approve of competitive racing . My sport is scuba diving . I think it 's safer . Do you have a reservation for Will Gleeson ? - Oh , yes . Here it is . - Thank you . Here you go . Oh , and by the way , there 's a gentleman waiting to speak to you in the bar . Who might that be ? John Corey , vice president of Trojan Tunnels . Good afternoon , Mrs. Gleeson . Good afternoon . What 's he doing up here ? Have you never heard " Behind every great fortune is a crime " ? Yes , sir . I also heard " Never bullshit a bullshitter . " - I 'll be up in a minute . - Okay . Now don 't start in on me about that tunnel again . - We need the tunnel . - I 'm not against the tunnel . The Marine Commissioner could 've been mistaken . Maybe the seismic detectors were up too high , or maybe ... Maybe , maybe , maybe . Maybe this and maybe that . All we got is a bunch of maybes . The baby 's body and Bill 's showed the same characteristics . As the scuba divers . Right . That 's not a maybe . All three men were in the water . But not the baby . Her carriage was parked on the pier with a drop of ten feet down to the water . Although she was found in the water , she didn 't jump in , not at 10 months of age . Robards ... they had to have something in common . We know , pretty much , the time of each disappearance . From the baby 's mother . Bill had just radioed the Coast Guard a few minutes before Jack heard him fall in , and we know the time of the divers ' deaths . The divers had intercoms in their ship , and they talked to each other on their two-way radios . Of course they did . That 's what they use when they 're inspecting the equipment . But the baby ... There isn 't any connection . Now there was nothing going on out on the coast road . The taxi driver had already radioed his dispatcher , and he did not report anything weird . The radio . The radio . They all had that in common . It 's against my principles to spend so much money on children . Why couldn 't you take up a nice hobby , like ... woodworking or baseball ? These walkie-talkies are great . You can coach us from the shore . And don 't think I won 't ! What ? Again ? You 're the champion pisher . Over there . Tommy , tell me , why do you think Jamie has to wee-wee so much ? He 's excited about the race . He is ? Listen , you must promise me something . That you will take care of Jamie . You know , he 's two years younger than you , and he doesn 't have so much experience sailing . Okay , Mommy . And you promise me something else . If it is a windy day , you both go in the same boat . Promise ? I promise . You 're so sweet . You 're a genius , like your mother . And I 'm a very good sailor . If I went in that boat with you ... you would certainly win . Then we 'd need a tornado to move the boat . Don 't be so smart ! Mommy , you 're plump . There 's more to love . Oh , sweet-talk me like your father . Jamie ? ! Huh ? Everything come out all right ? One more boy like you , and the Los Angeles River will overflow . Oh , my goodness . Come on . No more presents ! It can 't be that bad . What 's on your mind ? I was just thinking that I could be the happiest woman in the world . What do you mean " could be " ? Will , let 's ask them to send us dinner up here . Let 's stay here . Let 's stay in bed . How long ? For as long as you can take it . Well , it might be two weeks . Or until after the dive tomorrow . Oh , come on , honey . I know you 're worried , and I love you for it , but you got nothing to worry about . I know , I know . It 's your job . But ... Will , why do you have to keep pushing so hard ? Maybe I 'm just still a kid at heart . Oh , Will , I love you . And I 'm begging you , please , please don 't go . Oh , Vicky . If there 's one thing the streets taught me , it 's survival . - I 'll be careful ... - Survival . At 140 feet , your lungs can burst like a balloon , and you know that . All right . All right , honey . If it 'll make you any happier . I 'll only go down for three minutes , and I won 't go beyond 120 feet . That 'll give me a good edge , all right ? Three minutes . You 're willing to bet your life on three minutes . Well , I 'm not . Not your life , not our life together . Or does that matter to you anymore ? Vicky , now you listen to me . I 've lost two good friends here . I don 't know why , I don 't know how . But I 'm gonna find out . And you 're just gonna have to understand that , all right ? Come here , honey . - Hi , Vicky ! - Hi . Don 's taking us boating after lunch today . Do you want to come ? Still worried about Will , huh ? Well , he promised he wouldn 't go down deeper than 150 feet or stay longer than three minutes , but I 'm afraid he won 't keep his promise . I think if you paid a little more attention to yourself . I think you 'd get more reaction from him . Why don 't you come for a ride with us , Vicky ? No , thanks . I don 't really feel like it . There 's just a little too much tension around here , and I 'm feeling a bit uptight . But you three go ahead and have a good time , okay ? - You know the way my sister is . - Okay . Show him other men are interested in you . I would never need an invitation . She tried telling me that last night . Take care of your sister , will ya ? Okay , tell me where you are . We 've been cruising for about two hours . There 's an island up ahead . Can you help us ? Yeah , don 't worry about it . We 'll come and get you . Leave your radio open . We 'll find you . Oh , what a drag . God . We 'll have to wait it out . Hi Here 's that stupid pain in the ass . I 'm sick and tired of you . Don 't worry ! We 'll get you home in plenty of time for supper . Don 't stand there smiling . You 'll just encourage him , for Christ sake . Listen , so help me God , I 'll never take you in my boat ! You understand ? Hey , the guy 's really mad . Look , why don 't you go drown yourself , huh ? - Sure . - Adios . Look at that guy . We are up to our asses in trouble , and he goes for a swimming . Why don 't you go , too ? At least you might get the dirt off . I don 't feel like it . Are you tired ? Why don 't you go in ? At least you can float . You know , the exercise wouldn 't hurt you , and you promised me you 'd lose a little weight , right ? No one likes a fat man . Warn me , huh ? As soon as the Coast Guard calls . Okay . The moment they radio us , I 'll call you . Adios , chica ! You look like a seal ! You dumb bastard ! I 'll kill you ! Cabrón ! Get away from me , will you ? ! Got you again ! - Bravo . - Shark 's gonna kill you ! Ah , go to hell ! I 'll fix that fellow . Hey ! Jack ! Jack ! Don ? Don ! Where are you ? Okay , stop playing games . Oh , my God ! Don ! Wonder what the hell happened to the other half . Jesus , I don 't know . There 's some funny things happening around here , Will . Well , I 'll tell you one damn thing . It was no accident that ripped that stuff apart down there . Maybe Turner was right . There is something monstrous going on down there . The Trojan Tunnel Company has been using high-pitched frequency way the hell beyond the legal limit . Somehow , they 've damaged the underwater fauna . I 'm almost positive of that . That goes for the dead fish , but those ripped-up things down there ... what could 've done all that ? There 's only one thing big enough or powerful enough . Are you thinking about sharks ? No . I 'm thinking ... a giant octopus . - Yes ? - Mr. Whitehead ? I just had my ass chewed out by my editor . I 'm sorry , Turner , but you publicized a serious accusation against my company without checking your facts . Hell I didn 't . Your man Corey told me he was in charge , it wasn 't necessary to check with anyone else . - Check what ? - Findings of the Marine Commission . Give me specifics , Turner . What findings ? Hasn 't Corey told you ? Yes , but I want to hear it from you . Well , so far it 's only guesswork , but they 're beginning to suspect that your tunnel is somehow responsible for those deaths . Unless you can prove what you 're saying with facts , Turner , I 'd refrain . Hell , I don 't have any proof yet , but I sure as hell intend to get some . All right , Turner , I can see it 's pointless to continue this discussion . But if you persist , you 'd better get yourself a good lawyer , or your career may be over . Well , be that as it may , no amount of pressure from you or anyone else is going to make the slightest difference . Tommy ! Tommy , hurry up ! We 're gonna miss the race ! Coming ! You get the other things . Here , Jamie . Put these in the truck . Tillie , thank you so much for taking my boy along and doing all this . It 's so hard with my two jobs trying to get the house paid off . - I wish I could go with you . - You 're welcome any time . You know , Jamie and Tommy are such good friends . They 're inseparable . I 'd better hurry , or we 'll miss the race . That 's right . Good luck ! Don 't worry , Chris . They 're gonna have a great time ! Be careful , honey . That 's fine . Bye , Chris . So far , we haven 't been able to locate it . Well , who do you have looking ? Coast Guard cutter . Damn it , have you done anything else ? Well , we radioed her back in . Jesus Christ . You radioed her ? - Any news ? - Nothing so far , Sheriff . It was that damned tunnel , wasn 't it ? Chief , I suggest you bring Corey in for questioning . To hell with Corey . Let 's find my wife . Stop the engine ! Why don 't you go inside , Mrs. Gleeson ? No , thank you . Sam ? Sam ! Where are you ? ! Sam ? ! Evidently , there are a few things you forgot to mention . I didn 't think anything important would come by going ahead with our normal tests and experiments . But what kind of tests and experiments ? You know what kind . Whatever there is to know , Corey , you 'd better start telling me here and now . From time to time , I did push the tests beyond legal limits . But I just felt that it would be a good experiment for us . We 'd get through much faster , saving time and money . Understand me now , Corey . You 'll go back to conducting your tests according to regulations and curtail your personal ambitions and experiments . Your only saving grace is I 'd lose so much vital time if I replace you at this point . Now get back to work . And by God , man , if anyone else is to question Trojan again , you 'd better remember that it 's my responsibility to answer for it ! Welcome , welcome , welcome one and all to the Solana Beach Yacht Race . This is a wonderful day . The wind is just perfect today for sailing . Uncle Sam is so happy to see everybody here today . The families ... so happy to see the little children . It 's good to see families here . We have just a terrific turnout . It 's good to see all the people looking great today , and I know they 're having a wonderful time . Everybody is in a terrific mood ... it 's a giant octopus . I 'll be able to tell you more about it when we see the rest of those photographs . I always thought of an octopus as being harmless , even shy . It is . Something set this one off . I 've read that the suckers on a tentacle are like the claws of a tiger . Compared to suckers on a tentacle , claws are nothing , Mr. Turner . Nothing . I 'm so sorry to interrupt your meeting . Ned , I 've been driving around for an hour looking for you . Yeah ? I got my day off , so I was thinking if you wanna come up in my car , they 're about to start the practice runs any minute now , but if we hurry , we can get there for the race . Race ? My God ! The race ! How many miles is that Coast Guard warning good for ? Just the local sector , 30 miles . Would a giant squid 's range be greater than 30 miles ? Well , if it 's gone berserk , who the hell knows ? Beck , we 'll have the Coast Guard widen the danger-zone area . We gotta keep those kids from going in the water . What 's going on , Ned ? What 's wrong ? Will , it 's gotta be destroyed , that thing . Can you do it ? I 've only got one thought on my mind , Mr. Turner . Just one . I 'll be in touch with you from the boat . Emergency message for helicopter X-311 . Suspend the Solana Beach Junior Regatta . Have all boats in the area return to port at once , over and out . Did you hear about ... there was a Scotsman . And he was always going to the pub . Going to the pub all the time , getting drunk . And he won ... he won on the sweepstakes . Well , before he won the sweepstakes , he was always banging and bashing the doors and hitting the windows when he was coming home from the pub . So he won the sweepstakes , and his wife said to him . " Now , don 't be hitting the doors and the windows and everything when you come home drunk from the pub . Now you got a little money , you got to be dignified . Come around the other way by the pasture . " And so he comes home , and he 's all covered with cow ... you know what . And she says to him ... " Man , what are you doing coming home covered with all of this all over you ? " We had our second honeymoon last week . Only , this time , I went to the bathroom and cried . Did you folks know that 's one out of every two Americans wears glasses ? That just shows you how important ears are . Our neighbor girl next door is a delightful girl . However , she wears braces ... When things go wrong , and I 'll show you a TV repairman . Did you folks hear about the freighter that left Hong Kong ? Jamie ? Jamie , do you hear me , honey ? It sank 164 times . Jamie , don 't you hear me ? Jamie ! God , what 's happening ? Answer your mother ! Come on , don 't tease me ! Tommy ! Tommy ! Answer me ! Tommy ! Jamie ! Answer me ! What 's the matter ? Tommy ! Tommy ! Come on , answ ... I 'm talking to you . Can 't you hear me ? Tommy ? Tommy ! What the hell happened ? The chopper get here in time ? As soon as we know anything , we 'll let you know . Tommy ? Where ... Tommy , where are you ? Where the ... Where ... Tommy ? Tomm ... Jamie ? Didn 't Jamie ... Tommy ... Mommy ! Sweetheart ! Oh , thank ... Jamie ? Oh ... Sure there wasn 't anybody else ? Oh , no ! No , no ... Thank God . Will ? What now ? Check the loudspeakers . Make sure they 're working . We 'll wait . Don 't forget to take your medicine . How 're they doing ? Oh , they 're doing fine . - A little restless . - Yeah . - Here . - I don 't want any more . Maybe , uh ... maybe you 'd better not feed them for a while , huh ? Will ? I have a feeling the octopus won 't come back to his lair anymore . He 'll be there . But all octopi , large or small , have a sense of foresight . He won 't come back . This one 's very special . This one has tasted blood . This one thinks he 's stronger . It 's an animal disturbed by man 's stupidity . Summer . She 's an animal , too . No . Listen to her . Listen to the way she talks to me . Ah ... Winter . Hey ... you remember a couple years ago ... no , no , no . That was before you came . See , when I first started training , two years ago , well , it sounded like a ... a squeal , hmm ? And then , uh ... a whistle . And then last year ... it sounded more like a murmur or a groan . I understand them . They understand me . Sometimes they 're a little unpredictable . I mean , how do they tell you the octopus is there ? You remember I told you , a long time ago , that a killer whale had a brain about as large as a human being ? And they 're in contact with two different worlds . One , the air that they breathe . Two , the sea from where they came , from where they feed , from where the enemy is at . And now ... my enemy . Will , you never told me why you called them Summer and Winter . Is that when you caught them ? I met Vicky in the summer ... and married her in the winter . I guess you know now ... why I brought you here . I wanted to tell you more about it . But ... there have been many people that died . I 've lost a loved one . I need your help ... more now than ever . I remember the times ... when I was training you . People used to call you killers . They used to call me that on the streets . Doesn 't mean nothing . You have more ... more love ... in your heart ... more affection than any human being I ever met . But now , I ... I can 't ask anybody else . So I 'm asking you to help me kill this octopus . I hope you understand that . I know I 'm in your environment . I don 't want it this way . But if I release you ... and you go away ... I want you to know that I 'll understand . All right . Enough said . I gotta go now . If you feel anything , you talk to me . You make some noises . I know people think we 're crazy . Maybe we are . Maybe we are . Shit ! Son of a bitch ! Will ... Will ... the whales ! Well , at least they 're alive . Yeah , but they 're leaving . All right , Mike . This is it . Let 's go get him . The wind 's sure picking up . How are you feeling ? Well , I 've had better days . It 's our third day out . - What do we do ? - Well ... - Keep looking ? - You know , Mike ... I 've been thinking about , uh ... Africa . I 've been thinking about ... going on a safari . You know , uh , dry land ? Find some elephants , tigers , lions . - No sea lions . - Not a bad idea , Will . I 'll go along with you . Nothing holding us back now . We already reported the octopus as dead . Well , we might even ask Mr. Turner to come along with us ... as long as he don 't ask his sister . Right . It 's just my imagination . It couldn 't be . It 's not ! They 're coming back ! Yeah , Summer and Winter ! Come on , baby ! Come on ! Hey ! Come on ! - When you gonna get out of my life ? ! - That 's right ! - Over here ! - Come on , baby ! Come on ! Come on , wave back ! Wave back ! How do you like that ?

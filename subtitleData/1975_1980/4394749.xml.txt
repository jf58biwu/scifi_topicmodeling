 - Hi ! - Hello . Hello . Are you well ? - What 's your name ? - Yeah , I 'm very well . - My name is Greg . - I am Pet . Hello , Pet . I 'm looking for a man called Charles Vaughan . He 's here . Come on in . - Where are you from ? - A place about 50 miles away . - How many of you ? - Oh , there are 12 of us now . Come to see if I can buy some wheat . ( CHUCKLES ) Buy ? What with ? That . ( PET EXCLAIMS ) Now , we 've learned the art of curing skins . You know , we got hold of some lime and all the rest of it . So , not only am I selling those , a couple of cow hides out on the cart , but I 'm prepared to let you have the secret formula . - For two sacks of wheat . - What happened to your wheat ? Oh , I think we sowed ours too late . Then we got hold of some wild corn and that sprouted . You probably stacked it too wet . - Ah , probably did . - I expect we can let you have some . Oh , thanks . - You don 't have any matches , do you ? - No , ours ran out . We can make do with this . We 've only got about ten gallons of petrol left . So we have to count every drop . - How about you ? - One and a half gallons . - For emergencies . - Damn . I was hoping you 'd be able to give me a refill . Oh , we can spare that . That 's all right , I 'll manage . I just need one fire tonight to sort of get me to bed and thaw me out in the morning . And then one for a meal on my way home tomorrow . - You 're going back tomorrow ? - I 'm afraid so . - What do you live on there ? - Ah , sheep mostly . We 've got so many rams this year , I think they are likely to take over . And we got cattle and rabbits and chickens . We grow a bit of barley , potatoes , carrots . We 're doing very nicely . - Where can I get hold of Charles ? - Just a minute . Charlie ! - Take your coat off . - Hmm . Thanks . - Is that charcoal ? - Mmm-hmm . - Here . - Very clever . Secret formula . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Where do you know Charles from ? Well , I met him about a year ago . There were three of us then . Charles wanted us to settle with him . He always wants people to settle . Greg ! How are you ? - Good to see you . - You 're looking well . - How are you getting on ? - Well , fine . - Settlement 's doing well . - Yes , how 's ... Thank you , uh , Abby and Jenny ? Well , Abby 's gone off , 'cause she got news of her son . Uh , Peter , yes , yes I remember . Yeah , she said she 'd come back , but that was in June . - And Jenny ? - Well , she 's all right . - Got about 12 people now . - Great . Now , what are you doing here ? Nothing wrong ? Oh , no , no . Ooh , looks nice . Yes , well , I can see you 've learned to survive . - He wants wheat . - We got plenty . Hmm . Haven 't got any harness , have you ? Uh , no but I know where there was some in the autumn . GREG : We 've haven 't got the right skins to make harness . - Is that elderflower ? - No . - Grape . - Grape ? Yes . We grew some . It 's a little young , but I think you 'll be amused ... ALL : By its presumption ! - Here you are . Well . - Thank you . - Welcome . - Cheers . Sit down . Charles , a couple of months ago , we sent you our medical student Ruth , about your babies . Oh , yes , yes . Thank you . Uh , well , she did her best . One of the babies was still born , and the other one survived . Ida 's . And after that she and Lorraine just didn 't seem to hit it off . So Ida left and Lorraine went soon after and she took the boy with her . And I came on up here . You don 't happen to know where Ruth is now ? Uh , about 15 miles away , St Mary 's I think , someone had a bad fall . - Is she still there ? - No , I think she moved on . Do you need her ? Oh , it 's just Jenny 's having a baby in a couple of weeks and Ruth said she 'd come back and give us a hand . She just hasn 't turned up yet . - Yours ? - Uh-huh . It 's mine . ( CHUCKLES ) Congratulations . It 's me . - Hello , Paul . - Shh ! Lizzie 's asleep . I know . She 's been snoring . ( LIZZIE SNORING ) - Good night . - Good night , Paul . - You all right ? - Yes . Cheer up . He 'll be home in a day or two . Yes . Can I get you something ? No , thank you . Emma just brought me this . What 's up ? Just trying to imagine the baby . If it 's going to be all right . - What it 's gonna look like . - You don 't have to worry about that . That 's all sorted out . He 'll have your eyes and Greg 's hair . Or the other way around . - I checked John and Lizzie . - Oh , thank you . It 's funny how they adopted us , isn 't it ? Like ducks . The first thing they see after coming out of their shell , they call mummy . The first thing they saw after the Death was Greg and me . Ah , I do love them . - This one will be really yours . - Hmm . And Greg 's . There 's been a good few people pass through here , but there 's no one for me . I wish I had a woman , Jenny . Someone will come along . It 's not likely . I think I 'll have to go looking . Ruth will be back soon , you got on well with her . Out of my class . She fancied you . Why do you say that ? Don 't go , Paul . Greg needs you here . Oh , I liked Eddie , but I obviously didn 't care for the tension between us . Hmm . Still , it 's easier with just the one boss . You mean you prefer to be your own boss . ( CHUCKLES ) Yes , there 's that , too . Well , in these times there seems to be a natural distinction between the leaders and the led . - May I ? - Please , help yourself . Thanks . Where 'd you meet Pet ? Oh , she 's been here for about two months or so . She wandered around and about until she eventually arrived here . - She 's nice . - Mmm . Yes . You know , before the Death , her father used to run the Continental Caf√© in Worcester . It 's why she 's so good with the customers . Greg , why don 't you stay here till tomorrow ? Have a look at that wind pump . - What 's wrong with it ? - Nothing , really . Pumps water from the well to the roof tank . In fact , I 'd like to get a tank for the whole community . There must be something else we can use it for . Well , what you could do , you could hitch up a car dynamo to it and then charge up a car battery , - for a start . - Yes . You could have a primitive telephone system . If you run out a line from here to my place or wherever you want , then have a telephone at each end . I mean , obviously , it wouldn 't be hi-fi , but at least you would be able to make out the words . Telephone . Tell me , what do you know about the power loss over 50 miles of wire ? ( CHUCKLES ) Haven 't a clue . Can always read it up . Hmm . Here . Besides , how long will it take to run a line between here and your place ? And where do we get that amount of wire from ? Hmm . Suppose we just have to look for it . The old phone lines are still there . Yes , but they 're not intact . And they go through towns . - Which we won 't . - All right . We loop round the towns . You know , if we can get the wire , it wouldn 't take more than a week to trace a line . Who 's got a week ? ( CHUCKLES ) A feudal baron like you . Well , who 's talking about feudal barons ? ( CHARLES LAUGHS ) You know , Greg , if I traced a line between here and my neighbours , and he traced a line and so on and so forth , you know , we could cover the whole country with your dynamo and my wind pump . Yeah , well , when the baby 's born , let 's talk about it again . What do you burn in your lanterns ? Oh , mutton fat . You melt it down and strain it . Melt it down again and strain it again , till it 's pure . You know , that 's beautiful wine . What do you use in yours ? Mutton fat . - Good night . - Good night , Charles . LIZZIE : Mummy ! ( JOHN COUGHING ) It 's stuck ! I can 't move it . ( LIZZIE COUGHING ) Help ! BOTH : Mummy ! - I 'll go . - Oh , thanks , Paul . ( COUGHING ) Jesus . Get a towel or something . Help ! Help ! Go upstairs , quick . I 'll get the kids . Warn the others . - Is Jenny all right ? - Yeah , look after her . JOHN : Lizzie . ( CLANGING ) Fire , fire quick ! Get away from the door , I 'm gonna push it in . Are you clear ? John , down the stairs . Keep your head down . Fire , fire , quick ! PET : ( CHUCKLING ) Windy enough for you , then ? If it gets much windier , I think that windmill is gonna take off . - PET : Don 't worry now . - I 'll try not to . - Here you are . Payment in full . - Thanks , Charles . - Have you got your pie ? - Yeah , that should see me safely home . - Come and see us sometime . - Oh , yes we will . We 'll try . Listen , I 'll send one of our fellows off to a couple of places , see if we can find anything of Ruth . If you do get her , would you send her straight away ? - Yes , of course . - Bye . Yes . I 'll come back for another one of those . - Bye , Charles . - Bye , Greg . - Take care . - Thanks a lot . PET : Bye . Bye . Why did you let him go ? He had a baby due . He had to go . But you said we had to expand . It didn 't matter who came here again , you wouldn 't let them go . Didn 't you ? Yes . But you never even asked him to come back and settle here . No . Why ? Why didn 't you ? Not for any reason concerning you . Greg 's his own boss now , he doesn 't want to follow me . Go on , go and feed your pigs . My other pigs , you mean . Put some clothes on , you 'll freeze . Whoa . - What 's the matter , Arthur ? - The house , it 's been burned down . But Jenny 's all right . Whoa , whoa . Oh , Greg ... ( CRYING ) - What have you been living on ? - Carrots and turnips , raw . We couldn 't get a fire lighted because ... The house was too hot to get a burning bit of wood from . And then the rain came out . It was raining most of the time . Yeah , I know . I know . - We had milk . - PAUL : From Bessie . - It isn 't Bessie , it 's Rosie . - Oh , yeah , Bessie ran off . Right . Paul . Have you looked in there ? Yes , Donny and Pete were right beside the straw . I have no idea , Greg . It could have been a log from the fire or the boiler chimney , I don 't know . Can 't stay here now . You 're always saying we should have a standby cottage . Yeah , well , obviously I didn 't say it loud enough . I know there are cottages down the road . They are derelict , windows broken . Birds have got in . Rats . It 's not the weather for clearing them out . Or rubbing two sticks together . - Greg ? - Yeah ? We haven 't told the kids yet what happened to the others . What have you told them ? That they are sheltering somewhere else . - Yeah , well , I 'll tell them . - Do you need to ? Someone 's got to , sooner or later . Oh , put your coat on , lovey . Where are the blankets ? They are not blankets , they 're rugs . Anyway , I 'm keeping warm doing this . GREG : What are you doing , John ? - I 'm building a wall to keep Jenny warm . - Good boy . Where 's Aunt Emma ? LIZZIE : Yes . Where are the others ? You both come close and I 'll tell you . Come on . Now , the very worst thing that could have happened to us all was a fire in the middle of winter . And that 's exactly what has happened , that very worse thing . But it 's all over now , and we 've all come through it . That 's all of us who are here now . But the others had that same smoke that you had . And they tried very hard to get out , but they couldn 't and the smoke put them to sleep . That 's what I thought happened . ( SNIFFLING ) I did , really . So , what we 're gonna do is , we 're all gonna go on from here . We 're gonna have some warm milk from Rosie and then we 're gonna go on . And we 're gonna go to a farm where a friend of mine lives . There are lots of people there , plenty of children for you two to play with , and Ruth 's gonna be there , too . It 's gonna be all right , Jenny . I promise . - Don 't forget the rugs . - Here you are , Arthur . Catch . - Upsy-daisy ! - Take that in with you . - I 've got that old rug for you . - JENNY : Thank you . Okay then , Paul . Let 's get off . Come on . GREG : Right , out you come , you two . Come on , let 's have you . - Come on then , John . - JOHN : What is this place ? PAUL : A barn . LIZZIE : Who lives here ? GREG : Nobody lives in a barn , silly . It 's just full of hay . And it 's nice and dry . So you two undo a couple of bales and make yourselves some nice , dry beds , yeah ? Now , out you come . Don 't you keep this five star hotel waiting . ( JENNY SIGHS ) Oh , lovely . JENNY : I 'm all right . ARTHUR : Of course you are . Wrap this around you . What we want is some good , hot milk . Thank you . So , if Rosie 's willing . Are you willing , old girl ? Honestly , I don 't think she is . Oh , my feet . What about her ? She 's got four of them . Hey , look at me . Come up here , John , it 's great . Come on , Arthur , let 's have some milk . I 'll do that . I ... - There are rats here . - Lots of rats . Rats , bats , cats , it doesn 't matter . Who 's gonna grind some corn , hmm ? Gonna have some corn porridge . - And carrots . - Yes , and carrots . ( HAY RUSTLING ) Sorry , I didn 't want to wake you . Uh , it 's probably field mice or rats . Hoping to get something to eat from us . They 're going to be disappointed . - You slept ? - No , not much . ( SIGHING ) - You haven 't started ? - No . Talk to me , Greg . Tell me about Charles . Well ... he lives in a place called Whitecross . There are ten adults and five children there . And they all live in separate houses . And when I was there , we talked about the chance of setting up a telephone system to link up the different communities . And there 's a nice woman there called Pet . I suppose it 's short for Petrenella or something . I suppose she could just be called Pet . What about the babies ? The two babies . No , there was just the one baby . But I didn 't see it . What 's wrong with it ? ( LAUGHING ) There 's nothing wrong with it . I just didn 't see it . What about the other one ? There was supposed to be two . No , no . No , I think there was just the one . Hey , now , you try and get some sleep . - How 's Ruth ? - Fine , fine . ( GROANS ) He 's kicking . - Or she . - I 'm absolutely certain it 's a boy . Pack it in , Arthur . Lie down and get some kip . Can 't . I 'm too tired . - Thinking about the fire ? - Of course . Gonna have plenty of time to think of that . One blessing , I shan 't have as long as you . - What do you mean ? - You 're young . Come off it , Arthur . What 's happened is terrible , but your lousy , self pity isn 't gonna help any , is it ? - We 're all in the same boat . - I know , Paul , I know . But all our friends , Charmion , burned to death . I 've been pretty resilient during my career . I 've survived the Death . I 've even adapted to this ghastly way of life . But this last blow , I must be getting old . I can 't take it . Come on , Arthur . Funny thing is that you don 't really want to live and yet you still crave warmth and shelter . - Why are you here , Hubert ? - No reason . Just seeing . - Seeing what ? - Pigs , seeing pigs . - Those are pigs . - Oh , you sure they 're not sheep ? - Yeah . - Because one of my pigs is missing . And I think it 's among your sheep . - It 's not among my sheep . - Have you killed him ? You stole one of my pigs and now you 've killed him . I did not steal one of your pigs . You took one of my pigs . - I did not take one of your pigs . - Where is he ? You can 't steal your own , can you ? The pigs are mine . I fed ' em and I reared ' em . The sheep are mine , someone took one of my sheep yesterday . - You weren 't here yesterday . - Oh , I see . I wasn 't here yesterday so it was fine to take one of my sheep . But the sheep are everybody 's . That 's what I say , the pigs are everybody 's . So it was right for me to take what was my own . There are hundreds of sheep and there are only seven pigs . Six now . And there 's far too many rams . You killed one of my rams . I saw half the carcass . - Charles killed the ram . - Charles killed the ram . You 're Charles ' woman so I took one of your pigs . But there 's no salt left now and it 's gonna go rotten ... What 's going on here ? Listen , you sent me 20 miles yesterday , 20 miles back , and while I was gone you killed one of my sheep . A ram , yes . And I hope you 're gonna help us eat it . I hope so , too . - So I killed one of my pigs . - One of my pigs ! Yes ... Now wait , wait ! Wait a minute . There is no division of property here . Only division of labour . We each do what we can do best . I 'm sorry you killed the pig because we 're out of salt . Why is there no salt ? Your job to get salt . Because I can 't afford to spend a week in January by the sea boiling sea water . - Boiling the sea ? - Right . Hubert , you 've only been here about a month . - Now , we need to talk more . - We do . And because you always win , I 'm gonna go and put one of my pigs on to roast first . We 've got to learn to live together . - Hey ! - It 's Greg . Hello , you came back ! Who else is here ? We 've been burnt out Charles . Can you help us ? Of course . Of course . Pet ! Can you get some eggs and some bread and some butter ? You 'll find some logs in the back there . Now , if you go into the boiler , you 'll find some hot coals . Get a shovel full and follow us . - Thank you . - Okay . There , come on . Just let yourself go , love . You 're gonna be all right . There you are . Here we are . One of the last remnants of civilisation . When these rot , we 'll have to make do with other comforts . I 'm sorry we couldn 't prepare the place for you . It 's a bit dusty . The damp will go as soon as you light the fire . It 's not very well designed . I don 't know who used to live here . - Some commune people I think . - PET : She needs some sleep . Go on , this will get us warm . Got it ? JOHN : Yes . Do you think we should bathe her down ? No , I think you should let her sleep for a while . Thanks for the wood . I chopped some more for you . CHARLES : Oh , you 're welcome . LIZZIE : Here 's my twigs . JOHN : They 're too thick . LIZZIE : They 're not . No , I mean thin . - Got a light ? - No . Oh , wait for your ... What 's his name , Arthur , he 'll bring one . - Hey . - Oh , and this is Hubert . - Hubert , this is Greg . - Hi , Hubert . - How do ? - Paul over there . And that 's John . And that 's Lizzie . - Hello . - Hello . I came to say , I hear you had bad luck . Well , we 'll share some of this . With some of my wine - and some of Pet 's honey cake . - Honey cake . Make way , make way . I hope it 'll catch . - I see you use charcoal . - For the stove , yes . - Didn 't you ? - No . Oh , it 's hotter and it 's cleaner . Do you make bread on a wood fire ? - Yes . - What is charcoal ? Charcoal ? Well , it 's a long story and an old one . Once upon a time , there used to live an old charcoal burner in a house in the middle of the forest . And what he did was , he built the wood into stacks and he set fire to it , and then he covered it all over - with turf to keep the air out . - We must have a go at that . Look , it 's caught ! It 's going . ( ALL CHEERING ) - Let 's have a welcome drink , then . - Thanks . - We drink wine . - I 'll bet you do . There you are , then . Here 's one for you . Here 's one for you , Lizzie . Got one , Paul ? PET : You 've been taught your manners , I see ! - Well , welcome to Whitecross . - With much gratitude , old boy . - And to you , Pet . - Thank you . - Many thanks . - Thank you . Well , the set up here is , we each live our own lives . I mean , Hubert looks after the sheep and the others help with the main crop . The wheat , the oats , the hay . Pet and Peggy run the dairy , the milk , butter , cheese . We have a carpenter called Jack . And Pet has her pigs and her chickens and her ducks . - We all have chickens . - And I do all the odd jobs . And the land and the building and the plans . - Who makes the charcoal ? - I do . - JENNY : Greg . - Excuse me . - Where is everyone ? - They 're all in next door . - Greg , where 's Ruth ? - Mmm-hmm ? - I haven 't had time to ask yet . - How are you ? - Well ... - Would you like a wash down ? - I could put some water on to heat . - There 's a lovely fire going next door . - Yes . Yes , a wash would be nice . - Did you bring a kettle with you ? - No , I 'm afraid we didn 't . - It 's all right , I 'll find one . - Where 's Ruth ? - Who ? Oh , yes . Hubert . Hubert , this is Jenny . - She 's the one who 's expecting the baby . - I can see that . How do ? - Hubert went 15 miles yesterday ... - I was sent 20 miles there , 20 miles back , two days , sent for a doctor who used to live here once . PET : The day before yesterday ... HUBERT : This doctor was ... - Yeah , but she was a medical student . - Oh , she was . She was sent to St Mary 's to see about a broken leg , and then she left there to go somewhere else to see about a baby . And then she left somewhere else to see about somebody 's toothache . And she ain 't been back since . But now , if it 's babies ... Yeah , all right , thank you very much Hubert , that 's very kind of you . Thanks . I 'll put the water on for you . - Oh , Greg . - It 'll be all right . We don 't have a spare kettle , do we ? All right , I 'll give them this one . - I 'll find them a kettle . - Is the pump working ? There 's enough in the tank . Well , you got him , didn 't you ? - We got him . - And he 's not going to go again . Unless he loses the baby . Oh , my love , we 've expanded . Smile . This is a fallow field that goes with the house . Hmm ? By the way , the roof leaks a bit . I 'll give you a hand to fix that . If you 'd like to be alone , Paul and Arthur can move off to the white house . No , we 'll stick together for the time being . Thanks for the offer . - You didn 't keep bees , did you ? - No , we hadn 't got around to it . What did you do for sugar ? Used up what we had , and then went without . I 'd like to try sugar beat . We could boil it , crystallize it , purify it with animal charcoal . Charles , I 'm not sure if I 'm going to stay . - Jenny must have her baby here . - Yes . I 'd like to get all that over and done with , but when it 's the spring , I think we ought to move on and find a place for ourselves . Greg , I can 't keep you till the spring . Not without working . You don 't have to tell me that . You know we 'll work . It means digging , Greg . Putting your resources into the soil . You 're gonna leave that ? Leave your investment ? It doesn 't make sense , does it ? Then what would you do ? Find a fallow field and start work on it a couple of months late ? Charles , we get on well enough , but you know as well as I do , there just isn 't room for two of us here . - Oh . - So we 'll leave when it 's spring . In this sort of setup there 's room for both of us . Each to his own kingdom . Come on in . Have a look at that . - What is it ? - It 's a tinder box . You put dry moss , or charred cotton if you can get it , in there , turn the handle , you have to turn it very fast . There you are , you see . You get sparks , you blow and eventually you get a flame . I should 've thought of making one of these myself . - After all the matches ran out . - Hmm . No , no , no . No , you keep it . Oh , thanks . You don 't mind if I improve the design ? - Hello , Hubert , what 's in the sack ? - Yes , what 's in the sack ? Yes , Hubert , what is in the sack ? - A present for you . - For me ? Yeah , for you and your friends . Ooh . All I 'm saying is they 've got room for us in what they call the white house , if you think it 's too cramped here . - Thanks , Arthur . - There 's some folk already in there . - One of them is a nice-looking chick . - What are you waiting for ? - Hubert 's got a present . - He said for me . - JOHN : For all of us . - Here you are . A present . It 's a pig . A fair sized piglet . - That 's very kind of you . - I thought you might like a pig , seeing as you 've come with nothing . Trouble is , Hubert , we haven 't got any salt to salt it away with . So would you mind very much if we shared it around with everyone else ? Yeah , sure . - He didn 't have any salt either . - I thought they might like a pig . - You thought right . - Oh , yes . JENNY : Greg . It 's all right , it 's gone . - What 's gone ? Contraction ? - Well ... - Started then ? - Hubert . Look , I 've been a shepherd for years . I 've brought lots of lambs in the world . Well , I lost a few , but I done all right . If there 's any trouble , I know what 's what . I seen the vet do his stuff . So I 'll hang around , no trouble . Hubert , if we need you , we 'll find you , all right ? ( JENNY CRYING ) Oh , you 're going to be all right . There . You just tell me when the next one comes . Where 's Ruth ? Where 's Ruth ? She promised to come to me . You 'll be all right . Bit of a leak here . - Charles , can I have word with you ? - Okay , won 't be a second . - Jenny 's started . - How is she ? She 's feverish , but she keeps asking for Ruth . - And you know what I forgot to do . - Oh , no . Leave your address . Everywhere I 've moved on to since this started , I always leave a note of where I 'm going and how to get there . Well , in the circumstances . But don 't you see , Ruth 's going back there to help Jenny . If she went back there and you weren 't there , where would she go from there ? Oh , I don 't know . Back where she came from , I suppose . Well , we 'll have to find out , won 't we ? - But we don 't know where that is . - Oh , we know the general direction . A day there and a day back . I don 't see much point in that . I got some petrol . A gallon and a half won 't take you 100 miles . Bit of luck , I 'll be back in about four hours . ( JENNY BREATHING DEEPLY ) It 's going . That 's it . Nearly . - It 's gone . - Good . Is it good ? They 're supposed to happen every few minutes , aren 't they ? You 're fine . Have you got a watch ? There . It 's Charlie 's . He said you 'd ask for one . Thank you . - There 's so many things to go wrong . - If you 're a pessimist . I 'm not . - Is there soap and hot water ... - Kettle 's on the stove . - And soap ? - No . We 've run out of that . Because it 's not replaceable , we haven 't foraged for it . So we 've learned to do without it . Do without ? Is that Charles ' philosophy ? Well , I don 't have any philosophy . - You haven 't had any babies ? - No . - My sisters did . - How many sisters ? Four . And three brothers . I was the youngest by a long shot . An afterthought . So I had a lot of loving . As a child and as a woman . So I 'm a natural optimist . - How is she ? - Contractions every six minutes now . Jenny says it 's still the early stages . - She seems to have done her reading . - Yeah , she 's done that all right . Does it help ? Sounds like you need your brow bathed . Why don 't you sit down ? No , no , no , no , no . Why is Charles pulling a crazy stunt like this anyway ? Just to make me feel so grateful that I 'm gonna stay here forever ? Ruth won 't be there and life 's not like that . You 're wanted here Greg . Well , ask Charles . He said he wants you 'cause you 're an engineer . He said so . Well , the engineering age has been and gone . Now he 's been pouring out his superiority over me in everything . I 'm swamped in it . He 's a great fellow but I 'm getting out . Oh , don 't go , Greg . We can have such a lovely time here together . All of us , I mean . All of us . - It 's Ruth ! - It 's Ruth . Ruth . Ruth ! - Jenny 's been waiting for you . - Hello , Lizzie . Hello , John . - Hello . - Hello , Greg . Am I glad to see you . I 'll talk to you two later . Go look inside the car . There you are , she 's cold and she 's very hungry . - Yeah , well , I 'll take that . - Okay . - Thanks , Charles . - You 're welcome . Well , Ruth 's a lot more sure of herself . She 's taken a man 's appendix out . She gave him a couple of Pethadine tablets to kill the pain - and just opened him up . - Did he survive ? Yes , very well , she said . And she 's done a breech birth . She couldn 't wait to get back to Jenny . You were right , she was on her way back to St Mary 's . Come on , have some of this . Jenny 's doing fine . The baby is the right way up in a good position . She 's three fingers dilated , if you know what that means . It 'll be a few hours yet . Charles , I don 't suppose you 've got any soap , have you ? No , I 'm afraid not . I 'll have to use my precious stock , then . We 'll have to get your technology going soon , Charles . - What technology is that ? - Last one was four minutes . - Fine . - What 's the technology , Charles ? Oh , well , with the 21 people we have , all we can do at the moment is grub out a living from the soil and repair and maintain our clothes and our shelters . I mean , we all have specialities , some useful , some not , but the community is dependent on one person to do one specific job . I mean , Ruth is a good example . She hasn 't got the time to teach anyone , to pass her knowledge on . Well , I think that more people would give us that time . Time to send someone to the seashore and bring back salt . Time to make your telephone system , Greg . Time to make lime , not just for skins but for cement . And we could even make soap . We can maintain a library . And , eventually , the people will come , some to trade , some to settle . Before long we 'd have a town , and eventually a kind of civilisation . Go and rub her back , Greg , she 'll tell you . - Is there any more ? - Oh , yes , love . There 's my pig being roasted . But I 'll get you something else for the time being .

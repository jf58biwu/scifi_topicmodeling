Oh , Lord . Hi . You ask me how I survived ? It was very strange . Because I thought that did not survive . Almost a year ago I played . Then I wrote the song and watched who will all come to Las Vegas . I did not quit . Manager said he would help me and knows Frank Sinatra . I know this is a pathetic story . Who knows , maybe he was a friend . I never learned . He gave me some options . To do him a favor for a favor that he would do to me . And just when I did my part , dropped bombs . Then I decided not to become a star . Do you think that was not a good idea ? So , what happened to the manager ? - Alex , had no such luck . He could not accept that it happened . Never . Wake up in the morning and is believed to be all right . Then he would remember . Got a heart attack . Died within six months . In the beginning , I 'm cuja cars , planes , and ... One night I wake up and hear the bell , at bike . I run out and ask him . - Do not want to inhibit them , but I think you do not need so many clothes . We do not have that much space . Oh , sorry . You have to forgive me . It 's been so long since I was on the road . Can a suitcase . I suggest T-shirts and jeans . Better to pour fuel in Salt Lake before than go to the stone . Good . Think to Stone Mountain ? - Wonderful . Order swimming because the water is to preserve water and have some privacy . I can say that we can 't take a shower once a week we needed it or not . Oh , my God . Hey , Jake , look at this . Do not worry about them , they have no more problems . I imagine that they had just returned from buying . But there is something strange with this skeleton , Major . What ? We have a lot to clean . As if they were polished . It 's been two years . - I know , but the doors were still closed . Let 's go to town to see what we can find . What are you going with that crowbar ? Do you always use your credit card when you go shopping , major ? Do you think it will be fine with it ? Of course it will . What do you have against him ? Nothing . I just think that it is not reliable . Shit . I hate bugs . Look at its size . Yes I 'll be damned . Armoured cockroaches . - I guess there are still down . I 'll get the hose . Here . Well , start Pohit . Let 's get out of here . Seeds , Seeds ! Seeds , Seeds ! Watch the staircase .

When my mother died , father and I were just leaving . Nowhere determined . We were just leaving . And so for a long time . I did not use to see other people ? After what happened to my mother , father and I had a good hiding . And your father . What happened to him ? - He broke his leg . Fell off a cliff and broke both his legs . - What did you do ? I held him while he died . - When was that ? Well , four months ago , if I recall . I don 't remember so well . I just wander from then ? Not good if you just stand in one place . Let 's go over the ground in that machine there . You can go with us or you give foods and leave you here . As you wish . - Can I have some ? - Of course . Is it hard to learn how to drive the motor to which you chase me ? Not really . Well , I 'll go with you if you teach me to drive . I Can . So , what happens now ? No , that 's it . A thing is not meant to be . All these explosions expelled Earth from its axis . What is the axis ? Something like the center . - Yes , something like that . And if he does , everything would return to normal . Would another explosion do it ? That is correct ? I do not know . It could make it itself . - Nothing fixes itself . No matter how much they want to . I gotta succeed . Do you want to drive a little bit ? Do you think I could ? Try . - Come on , we will for a while . Grab the wheel . We have reached nowhere . Maybe there is still fuel in the tank . OK , folks , we have10 minutes to refuel . Who wants to refresh and go to the toilet , he can . You should be here somewhere generator . Watch the back . Do you think it 'll work ? - I doubt it . Are you okay ? How are you guys ? Have a nice machine . Where are you going ? - To Albeniju .

Can we do something for you before we go ? To check . And , guys ? Do you have something in mind ? I know . Can you show us that your machine , General . That 's what we like . A boy and a woman can not stay here . To rest . Perhaps the lady could tell us something strummed . That would be nice . Why do not we play for something ? What would you like to play ? - I do not care . Just play something . I continue to play . Mali , come here . Stop next to her mother . She 's not my mother and you 're not my father . I do not have anywhere to stand . - I 'll beat him when you catch him . I 'd better get him to come . Billy , Billy , come back . Lost . - Can I get another sucker , please ? I 'm not going to say anything to your friends . So , you go to Albena . It 's a long way . Go back there . He drove me there . He said that wants to be alone with my mother . Hey , you can do so . - I 'll take care of it . You keep an eye on these two . Come on , kid . - I want to be with her father . - Let him stay here . What about your friend and my wife ? Easy , sir . Do not do anything that and the rest will not do it . Only doing wrong order . Imam PCLA 99 . - I agree . Slow . We have to tune it . We 're Losing the rear wheels . Go to 015 degrees north . Yes , we 'll go next to Detroit . - To find spare parts for this thing ? It 's designed to use spare parts of trucks . I need the shaft . Hold it under 60 kmh . Will things ever return to normal ? - Who knows , Billy . Even now we do not look so bad . Still have food and drink . Fireworks in the sky . Who knows , if this thing starts Denton , we might get somewhere . Where , in Albena ? Just does not matter . This is exactly failed machine . - Why are we here , Tenere . Is this a good party ? - Here you 've got plenty of room . I 'll let you drive in reverse . Do you see a truck ? What we need is the axle . Maybe this way . See there . - Must be a department with a truck . Like my old truck . Everyone out to Disneyland . Flagging this park as a national monument . This looks good . - Tenere , I need your help . Do you hear that sound ? - What about it ? I do not know . As a fan of the engine somewhere . I do not know . I 've never seen so many cars . - It 's your legacy , Billy . What is a legacy ? This is something that people leave each other when they see that it no longer works . Hey , the sound becomes louder . - Look , I 'm going to help Denton . Do not roam around , this place is a lot shot . A lot of big shot ? Yes , I have a Puma , Barracudas , Mustangs , Cougar , Impala . The place is a real zoo . Is this a hurricane ? - I do not know what it is . Better go find you , Billy . Hey , Denton , comes the storm . You do not have to tell me . Does not look like we can " hurry " .

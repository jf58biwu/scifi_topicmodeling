 Have you got any biscuits over there ? Here 's some cornbread . I am cold . Brett ? - Right . I feel dead . - Anybody ever tell you you look dead ? man . I think we ought to discuss the bonus situation . we think we deserve full shares . Mr Parker and I feel the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level . like everybody else . but everybody else gets more than us . Mother wants to talk to you . I saw it . Yellow light 's for my eyes only . huh ? Parker ? I haven 't finished my coffee . It 's the only thing good on this ship . Mother . - Right ? - OK . Plug us in . Thank you . - Where is Earth ? - You should know . It 's not our system . Scan . I can 't believe this . Contact traffic control . calling Antarctica traffic control . Do you read me ? Over . out of the Solomons . Registration number 180924609 . - Nothing . - Keep trying . Antarctica ? Over . just short of Zeta II Reticuli . We haven 't reached the outer rim yet . That 's hard to believe . What the hell are we doing out here ? Don 't know . What the hell are you talking about ? That 's not our system . I know that . Do you ever notice how they never come down here ? right ? man . I think I know why they don 't come down . It 's because of you . You have no personality . - You happen to be in my seat . Can I have it ? - Yes . Of course . Sorry . baby ? some of you may have figured out we 're not home yet . We 're only halfway there . - What ? - Mother 's interrupted ourjourney course . Why ? She 's programmed to do that should certain conditions arise . They have . It seems she has intercepted a transmission of unknown origin . - She got us up to check it out . - A transmission ? Out here ? What kind of a transmission ? Acoustical beacon that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds . - SOS ? - I don 't know . - Human ? - Unknown . - So what ? - We are obligated under Section ... not a rescue ship . this kind of duty . I 'd be happy to oblige . Let 's go over the bonus situation . can I say something ? There is a clause which states " Any systematised transmission indicating intelligent origin must be investigated ... I wanna go home and party . will you just listen to the man ? ... on penalty of total forfeiture of shares . No money . yeah ! - We 're going in . Yeah . We 're going in . Lambert ? - Good God . - Doesn 't sound like any radio signal I know . - Maybe it 's a voice . - We 'll soon know . Can you home in on that ? What was the position ? 6550-99 . it found the quadrant . two seconds . OK . Put that on the screen for me . that 's it . It 's a planetoid . 1200 kilometres . - It 's tiny . - Any rotation ? - About two hours . - What about gravity ? 0.86 . You can walk on it . Approaching orbital apogee . Mark . Equatorial orbit nailed . DOR 's in line . - Status on the lifters ? - Give me an AC pressure reading . 48 seconds and counting . Prepare to disengage from platform . 20 seconds . 17 ... lock . Disengage . Clear . Money 's safe . Let 's take her down . port yaw . - Prime the port . I 'm not getting anything . Turbulence . Locked and floating . You can drop us any time now . there 's going to be a little bump . What the hell was that ? Pressure drop . Must have lost a shield . Let 's go with it . I 'm still not getting anything . Yeah . Dropping off now . Still dropping . we 've got it . Take her down . Navigation lights on . Kill drive engines . What the hell happened ? - Somebody give me an answer ! - Is the hull breached ? I don 't see anything . We still have pressure . - Push the screen . - Why ? Secondary load-sharing unit is out . Three of the four cells are gone . hold on . We can 't fix it out here anyway and we need to reroute a couple of these ducts . Dry-dock time . Dry-dock . Tell him to dry-dock ! We couldn 't fix it out here anyway . We 've gotta reroute all these ducts . we 've got to dry-dock . What else ? Some fragments caked up . We 've got to clean it out and repressurise it . How long before we 're functional ? tell her . At least 25 hours . Get started . I 'll be right down . - What the hell 's she coming down here for ? - She better stay the fuck out of my way . Any response yet ? except the same transmission every 12 seconds . All the other channels are dead . Kick on the floods . We can 't go anywhere in this . Mother says the sun rises in 20 minutes . 000 metres . Walking distance ? - Can you give me an atmospheric ? - Yes . It 's almost primordial . methane ... - I 'm working on the trace elements . - Anything else ? lava base . well below the line . I 'll volunteer to be in the first group to go out . that figures . Lambert . - Swell . You 'd better break out the weapons . are you receiving ? Good contact on my board . Clear and free . Keep the line open . Let 's go . Ripley . I want to ask you a question . do we get full shares ? you 'll get whatever 's coming to you . I 'm not gonna do any more work until we get this straightened out . you 're guaranteed by law to get a share . - What ? - Why don 't you just fuck off ? Rip ? I 'll be on the bridge . come back here ! - Son of a bitch . - What 's the matter ? Can 't see a goddamn thing . Quit griping . knock it off . I can . I 've never seen anything like it . It 's very bizarre . You said it . All right . Moving on to second ... position . What is it ? Let 's get outta here . We 've got this far . We must go on . We have to go on . Will you say that again ? Shit ! it 's hard to describe . I 'm going back to the console . Dallas ! Come on down here . There 's something different here . we can find out . Alien life form . It looks like it 's been dead a long time . Fossilised . Looks like it 's grown out of the chair . Bones are bent outward . Like he exploded from inside . I wonder what happened to the rest of the crew . Let 's get the hell outta here . Dallas ! Lambert ! Come on over here ! Come on . - What have you got ? - See what you make of this . It doesn 't look like an SOS . I ... It looks like a warning . - I 'm gonna go out after them . - What 's the point ? they 'll know if it 's a warning or not . Yes ? Are you OK down there ? - Can you see anything ? - I don 't know ... A cave . but it 's like the goddamn tropics in here . What the hell is this ? The pit is completely enclosed . like eggs or something . There 's a layer of mist covering the eggs that reacts when broken . Kane ? Are you all right ? I 'm OK . All right . I just slipped . It appears to be completely sealed . there 's movement . It seems to have life . Organic life . Ripley ? - I 'm right here . Ripley . I 'm at the inner lock hatch . - Right . let us in . - What happened to Kane ? - Something attached itself to him . What kind of thing ? An organism . Open the hatch ! the ship could be infected . You know the quarantine procedure . - 24 hours for decontamination . - He could die . Open the hatch . we could all die . Could you open the goddamn hatch ? We have to get him inside ! and if you were in my position you 'd do the same . do you hear me ? this is an order ! Do you hear me ? Yes . I read you . The answer is negative . Inner hatch open . My God . What the hell is that ? Jesus Christ . man ? how the hell 's he breathing ? - He still alive or what ? And why don 't you guys freeze him ? How come they don 't freeze him ? What 's going on in there ? - What the fuck is going on ? - You bitch ! - Jesus Christ ! - Hey ! Hey ! break it up . I expect to be obeyed ! - Even if it 's against the law ? - You 're goddamn right ! She has a point . Who the hell knows what that is ? How are we gonna get that off of him ? - How are we gonna get it off ? - Just a minute ! I 'll get some instruments . if I make an incision here to try and remove one of the digits from his face ... You 're gonna do what ? Finger . I 'll try and get this finger off . Get this cleating on there ... - It 's tearing his scalp ! - I know ! It 's not coming off without tearing his face off with it . We 'll have to take a look at him inside . How come they don 't freeze him ? How come you guys don 't freeze him ? You can take your mask off . - What 's it got down his throat ? - I would suggest it 's feeding him oxygen . then keeps him alive . What the hell is that ? - We 've got to get it off him . - Just a minute . Let 's not be too hasty . We don 't know anything about ... it . it could kill him . I 'll take that chance . Let 's cut it off him now . yes . Get him out of there . Where do you want to do this ? We 'll make an incision just below the knuckle there . - Right here ? - Stand by . Good God ! That crap 's gonna eat through the hull . I think it 's going to eat through the goddamn hull . Come on ! What 's going on ? This way . Next deck . There it is . Don 't get under it ! Looks like it 's stopping . man . quick . come on ! Don 't get any on your arm . It 's stopped . except molecular acid . It must be using it for blood . It 's got a wonderful defence mechanism . You don 't dare kill it . What about Kane ? Here 's your pen back . - What do we do now ? - Leave Kane to Ash . You get back to work . Oh ... What ... ? OK . Try it . - Damn it . I felt sure that was it . - Try it again . Feel like I 've been in this place a month . We shouldn 't have landed here in the first place . I know that . the sooner we can go home . This place gives me the creeps . It 's amazing . What is it ? um ... I don 't know yet . uh ... A little talk . How 's Kane ? He 's holding . No changes . our guest ? actually . But I have confirmed that he 's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides . which gives him a prolonged resistance to adverse environmental conditions . Is that enough ? That 's plenty . What does it mean ? - Please don 't do that . Thank you . - I 'm sorry . making him a ... tough little son of a bitch . And you let him in . remember ? I 'm senior officer . yes . I forgot . You also forgot the Science Division 's basic quarantine law . I see . You just broke it . What would you have done with Kane ? Hm ? You knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here . you risk everybody 's life . Maybe I should have left him outside . but it was a risk I was willing to take . It 's a pretty big risk for a science officer . is it ? I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you . You do yourjob and let me do mine . Yes ? - Where 's Dallas ? - In the shuttle . - Why ? - Something 's happened . - Serious ? - Interesting . meet me in the infirmary right away . I don 't know ! - We have to try and find it . - Let 's check it . please be careful . Sorry . not in the corner ! Have one of these . Just in case . Kane ? Are you OK ? - I didn 't see it . Was it in the overhead ? - It was up there somewhere . will you ? It 's alive . We 've got to have a look at this . Excuse me . - It seems dead enough . - Good . Let 's get rid of it . this is the first time we 've encountered a species like this . It has to go back . All sorts of tests have to be made . are you kidding ? This thing bled acid . Who knows what it will do when it 's dead ? I think it 's safe to assume it isn 't a zombie . it has to go back . but you 're the science officer . Ash . - Dallas ! - You won 't make me change my mind ... - I 'm not trying to change your mind . I just want you to listen ... Will you listen ? - How can you leave that decision to him ? - I just run the ship . Ash has the final word . - How does that happen ? - That 's what the company wants . - Since when is that standard procedure ? - Standard procedure is to do what they say . - What 's happening with the repairs ? - They 're pretty much finished . - Why didn 't you tell me ? - There 's still some things to do . the reserve power system 's blown ... That 's horseshit . We can take off without that . I just wanna get the hell outta here . Dust in the intakes . Number two 's overheating . for Christ sake ! We 're hot and we 're getting hotter . red clip status . - One kilometre on ascension . - Engage artificial gravity . - Engaged . - I 'm altering the vector ... now . Inhibit CNG . - Struts retract . - Struts retracted . Walk in the park ! baby ? Right ! why don 't we stop it there ? - We can get to a doctor back home . - Right . you know ? Right . your staffjust follows you around and says " Right " ! Just like a parrot . a parrot ? - Right . knock it off ! and so are we . please ? based on time spent ... - Give me the short version . How far to Earth ? - Ten months . God . Yes ? I think you should see Kane . - Has his condition changed ? - It 's simpler if you come . - We 're on our way . Right . How are you feelin ' ? - How are you doing ? - Terrific ! Next silly question ? thank you . Do you remember anything about the planet ? What 's the last thing you do remember ? I remember some horrible dream about smothering and ... where are we ? - Right here ! - We 're on our way home . Back to the old freezerinos ! - I 've got to have something to eat first . - I need something to eat myself . One more meal before bedtime . I 'm buying . that 's a break ! The first thing I 'm going to do when I get back is to get some decent food . but then I 've tasted better . You pound down the stuff like there 's no tomorrow . I 'm thinking food . you know what it 's made of . I don 't wanna talk about what it 's made of . I 'm eating this ! baby ! What 's wrong ? What ? What ? - This is serious . - Kane ! Get the spoon ! - Get it into his mouth ! - I 'm trying ! God ! - Dallas ? - Yeah . - Anything ? - No . You ? Nothing . - Did you see anything ? - No . Inner hatch sealed . Anybody want to say anything ? like a cattle prod . It 's got a portable battery . It 's insulated from here to here . Just make damn sure nobody puts their hand on the end of it . It shouldn 't damage the bastard unless its skin is thinner than ours . But it will give him a little incentive . Now we just have to find him . I 've taken care of that . I 've designed this tracking device . You just set it to search for a moving object . it gives off a signal . What does it key on ? Micro changes in air density . Gimme a demo . See ? And again ... Gotcha . you take Parker and Brett . get rid of it . The channels are open on all decks . keep in touch at all times . Let 's go . I thought you fixed 12 module . We did . I don 't understand it . The circuits must have burned out . hold your light over here . that 's it . I don 't know if this is going to work . - Put this in there . - Right . Check the insulation . Shit ... it 's within five metres . my ass . It 's within five metres . Be careful . don 't creep up on me with that thing . - You guys stick together . whoa now ... - What ? it 's in this locker . In where ? take it . I got it . Wait . Parker ? When I say . - All right . Now . - Easy . man ? ! It 's the cat . now . We had to bag it . Now we might pick it up on the tracker again . man . we 'll go on . kitty ! kitty . Kitty crap . Jones ! Jonesy ? Jonesy ! Jonesy ? kitty . Jonesy ! Jonesy ? kitty . kitty . Jonesy . kitty . kitty . Jonesy ? Jonesy . baby . That 's a kitty . baby . That 's a kitty . I 'm not gonna hurt you . Come on . Brett ! Brett ! Brett ! it was big . No question . It 's ... It 's using the air ducts to move around . Could he want Brett alive ? - What ? - Could Brett be alive ? I ... I don 't think so . this air shaft may work to our advantage . It leads up to and comes out in the main airlock . There 's only one big opening along the way . We can cover that up and then we drive it into the airlock and zap it into outer space . The son of a bitch is huge ! it 's like a man . It 's big ! Kane 's son . Ash . The science department should be able to help . How can we drive it ? considering its nutritional needs . But we don 't know about temperature . temperature . What if we change it ? - Let 's try it . Most animals retreat from fire . can you rig three or four incinerator units ? - Who gets to go into the vent ? - I do . No . take the main airlock . please . I 'm right here . - Parker ? - Yeah . - Lambert ? - In position . I 'm trying to get a reading . Ripley . Ready . I 've got a reading on you now . Open the hatch to the third junction . I 'm through . I 'm moving on . hold on . I think I got it . I 've got it . - Where ? It 's somewhere around the third junction . OK . Moving on . you 're gonna have to be careful . All right . I 've reached the third junction and I 'm going down . What the hell 's the matter with that box ? hold your position for a minute . I ... - I 've lost the signal ! - What ? You sure ? Are you sure it 's not there ? It 's got to be around there . Lambert . You may be getting interference . are you sure there 's no sign of it ? It is there ! It 's gotta be around there ! Dallas ? All right . Am I clear ? I wanna get the hell outta here . God ! It 's moving right towards you . Move ! Get out of there ! Move ! Dallas ! Dallas . Get out ! No ! Not that way ! The other way ! Dallas ? - No . - Take it easy . Dallas ! We found this laying there . No blood . No Dallas . Nothing . - I don 't hear anybody sayin ' nothing . - I 'm thinking . we 'll proceed with Dallas 's plan . no . You 're out of your mind ! - You got a better idea ? - Yes . I say that we abandon the ship . and hope somebody picks us up . shh . - The shuttle won 't take four . - Then why don 't we draw straws ? I 'm not drawing any straws . I 'm for killing it now ! OK . Let 's talk about killing it . It 's in the air shafts ... Parker ? Shut up ! Let 's hear it . Let 's hear it . - It 's using the air shafts . - We don 't know that ... That 's the only way ! We 'll move in pairs . We 'll go step by step and cut off every bulkhead and vent then we 'll blow it the fuck out into space . Is that acceptable to you ? yeah . But we have to stick together . - How are our weapons ? - The weapons are fine . This one needs refuelling . please ? Ash . Don 't follow me . Ash ! Any suggestions from you or Mother ? No . We 're still collating . You 're what ? You 're still collating ? I find that hard to believe . Ash . Nothing . thank you . All right . you know . I don 't wanna hear your goddamn explanation ! Parker . Lambert ? Ash ! Will you open the door ? Ash . What the hell are you doing ? get her up ! It 's an android ! Jesus ... It 's a robot ! Ash is a goddamn robot . God ! Holy shit ! Help me get this fucking thing off ! Jesus ... God . How come the company sent us a goddamn robot ? They must have wanted the alien for the weapons division . He 's been protecting it right along . will you plug it in ? - Um ... I don 't know ... Because he may know how to kill it . can you hear me ? I can hear you . What was your special order ? You read it . I thought it was clear . priority one . All other priorities rescinded . you son of a bitch ? ! all other priorities are rescinded . Ash ? There 's gotta be a way of killing it . - How do we do it ? - You can 't . That 's bullshit ! do you ? The perfect organism . Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility . You admire it . I admire its purity . unclouded or delusions of morality . I 've heard enough of this and I 'm asking you to pull the plug . Last word . but ... you have my sympathies . We 're gonna blow up the ship . We 'll take our chances in the shuttle . - Blow up the ship . - Good . Come on . how long do we have ? - Ten minutes . - No bullshit . Or else we won 't need no rocket to fly through space . We 'll need coolant for the air support system . You two go down and get all the coolant you can carry . I 'll get the shuttle ready . I 'll give you about ... about seven minutes . I 'll shut the switches off and we 'll blow this fucker off into space . - Ready ? - Take care of yourself . Seven minutes . Take it easy . Jones ? Jones ? check the bottles . Jones ? - How are you doing ? - Fine . go ahead . Jones ? kitty . come here . Jones . boy . Come here . Nice kitty . Jones ? Jones ? sweetheart . Jones . Jones . Jones . Jones . Jones ! Goddamn it . Now I 've got you . sweetheart . Nice kitty . my God ... - Get out of the way ! - I can 't . Get out of the way ! It 's gonna kill us ! I can 't ! get out of the way ! - Parker ... Lambert ... Lambert ! Lambert ! Lambert ... Parker ... Get ready to roll ! Parker ? Danger . The emergency destruct system is now activated . The ship will detonate in T minus ten minutes . The option to override automatic detonation expires in T minus five minutes . Dallas ? Brett . Kill me . The option to override automatic detonation expires in T minus three minutes . The option to override automatic detonation expires in T minus one minute . 20 seconds . 10 seconds . The option to override detonation procedure has now expired . Mother ! I 've turned the cooling unit back on ! Mother ! The ship will automatically destruct in T minus five minutes . You bitch ! Goddamn it ! Jones . You now have one minute to abandon ship . The ship will automatically destruct in T minus one minute . 20 seconds . 10 seconds . you son of a bitch . It 's all right . too . It 's OK . Come on . You ... are ... my lucky star . You are my ... lucky star . You ... lucky ... OK . come on . You are ... my lucky star ... You my lucky star ... You are my lucky star ... You are my lucky ... You ... are my lucky star ... Final report of the commercial starship Nostromo . Third Officer reporting . The other members of the crew - Ash and Captain Dallas - are dead . Cargo and ship destroyed . I should reach the frontier in about six weeks . the network will pick me up . signing off . cat .

 [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] The Space Administrators are assembled in the conference hall , Supreme Commander . You are 8 minutes behind schedule . I left orders that I was not to be disturbed . I will not see or speak to anyone . - But the conference . - Cancel it . It will be reconvened when I am ready . Yes , Supreme Commander . Surveillance tracer transmitting . Computer visualisation of Space mastership is on line . - Take a look up there , Maryatt . - What is it ? That 's the planet Cephlon , which means that we 're on course and speed . Six more days and we 'll be at our destination . You keep saying " our destination " . Just where is it ? What 's its name ? - You 'll find out . All in good time . - But why the secrecy now ? We 're on our way . There 's nothing to lose by telling me where we 're going . Security 's become a habit with us . It 's become second nature . Because of it we 've enjoyed thirty odd years of complete independence . That 's something we value . - Is there anything down there ? - There was , once . Yes , once it was the trading and cultural centre for this entire star system . Very important , once . Not any more . - Well , what happened ? - War . Reversion to primitive . Nobody 's certain if there 's any people left down there . At one time it . [ ALARM BEEP ] What 's wrong ? What 's the matter ? We 're getting trajectory shift . Compensators aren 't holding us up . Going over to manual . [ ALARM BEEP ] Come on , pull us back Come on ! - Come on ! - We 're picking up speed . Yes , it 's gravity drag from Cephlon . I must have misjudged and got too close . - Can you get us out ? - I 'm on three quarter boost . She 's not responding ! I 'm going to maximum . It 's all right . She 's slowing . Compensators beginning to hold . Come on , that 's my beauty . That 's it . Come on . Pull us back , pull us back . All right , she 's coming back . We 're all right . Don 't do that too often , will you ? I 'm a very nervous passenger . I 'm a very nervous pilot . [ EXPLOSION ] What 's happened ? There was an explosion . Could have been a power unit burnout . Zen located her about five minutes ago . We put her on the scanner to run a security check . Suddenly she just went off course . - Shouldn 't we try and help them ? - If they 're still alive . Identification ? The ship is a Spacemaster , Series Five . Four neutron power units with a maximum thrust of four by six . Does she carry life capsules ? Standard equipment specification lists two high impact , unpowered survival modules . She 's entering the atmosphere . Beginning to burn up . Maryatt ! Maryatt ! Get yourself out , lad ! The life capsule ! Come on , Maryatt , you 've got to get out ! Navigation computers estimate six minutes to impact . They 've ejected ! Zen , lock tracers on to those capsules . I want to know exactly where they land . Trace locked on . [ IMPACT EXPLOSION ] [ TRACER HUM ] Surveillance tracer has ceased transmission . The ship has exploded . Surface conditions ? The planet Cephlon has a breathable atmosphere with a high oxygen content . The radiation level is in excess of normal tolerance levels , and prolonged exposure could result in tissue damage . Massive variations in temperature levels . Gravity is 125 G. Life forms ? There is no current information . Logic units suggest that remaining life may have mutated through exposure to high radiation . None of which sounds very promising . You 're sure you want to go down ? Are you afraid that I 'll be able to cope with it better than you ? - No . - Perhaps you ought to be . - Down and back as fast as you can , right ? - Naturally . We 're going to have to make this fast . The chances are that any survivors won 't have come through the landing impact anyway . - I disagree . They may well be alive . - That 's why we 're going down . If we run into any kind of trouble we teleport back up immediately . All right , Cally ? Do you know what we 're looking for ? I 've never seen an impact life capsule . They 're bullet shaped , built to be energy absorbing . Theoretically they could free fall from the edge of the atmosphere onto solid rock without even bruising the people inside . - Is there a life support system ? - Basic respirator , that 's about all . The co-ordinates place both capsules within one square mile . We 're going to put you down in the centre of the search area . - Co-ordinates set . - One of us will stay by the teleport . Be careful . All right . Put us down . [ TELEPORTER WHINE ] That must be the wreck of the ship . No point in checking it . We 'll split up into pairs to search . Jenna and Gan , cover that area . Vila , you 're with me . No tacks . Can 't be in regular use , anyway . I wonder what 's behind it ? Half the hill , probably . Come on , let 's go and look for those capsules . Let 's get it open . He 's dead . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Avon . - We 've found one of the capsules but the man inside is dead . See if you can find any identification on the body . Then seal up the capsule . - Right . - One down , one to go . That 's all there is . There ! - He looks pretty far gone . - There 's nothing we can do for him here . - We must get him up to the Liberator . - Will he live through the teleport stress ? We 'll just have to take that chance . Give me your bracelet . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Gan . We found the second capsule , the man 's alive . We 're taking him up to the ship Stand by for teleport . Ready . Bring us up , Cally . [ TELEPORTER WHINE ] - Is he still alive ? - Just about . Get him to the surgical unit . - Easy . - Compensators . - All right . Okay . - Not holding . Here we are now . Here we go . - Out of the way . - Okay . Respirator . - I found this on the other man down there . - Uh huh . - Jenna 's not back yet . - Where is she ? - Gan . You were with her . - She was right behind me when we teleported . Cally , look after him . You three come with me . [ TELEPORTER WHINE ] Jenna , this is Liberator . Do you read me ? [ TELEPORTER WHINE ] [ TELEPORTER WHINE ] We 'll go back down . I think you 'd better . This way . I left her here . The ground 's scuffed about . And there 's a footprint . A large footprint . That 's Jenna 's . Obviously somebody , or something , attacked her . - And obviously it won . - She might have made a run for it . She would never have taken off her teleport bracelet . Therefore somebody else must have . Do you think they 've killed her ? Probably not . If they 've robbed and killed her , why drag off the body ? Why not just leave it ? - So , she 's a prisoner . - So let 's find her . - We 'll do it a lot faster if we work separately . - Agreed . - Well ? - Bit of a risk , though . With the radiation level on this planet , just being here is a risk . Let 's get started . Unless one of us finds something , we 'll meet back here in an hour . - They should have found her by now . - They will . It 's just a matter of time . They 'll find her . - What about him ? - I don 't know . He 's in a great deal of pain What 's that ? - Gan found it on the man in the other capsule . - Who was he ? His name was Maryatt . According to his ID he was a Space Surgeon in the Federation Medical Corps . He 's got a double A security clearance ! He 's got a pass for any area in Space Command ! He must have been very important . Anything else ? No . Some pictures , a woman and two children . Let 's see if he 's got any identification . - What are those ? - I don 't know . They look like micro power cells . I 've never seen that type before . Help help me . Help me . You 're quite safe . We 've given you something to ease the pain . You 're going to be all right . Maryatt ? What happened Maryatt ? We found his body . He was probably dead before you left your ship . - Energy cells . - They 're here . They 're quite safe . Must get to my father . Without them , he has only a few days to live . Gently , gently . Shhh . He 'll die . Don 't you understand ? He 'll die without them . - Now stay calm . - You get to him . Promise . Promise ! We 'll do everything we can . What was your destination ? - Planet Aristo . - Where ? Navigation log give all flight details you need . All right . We 'll run it through our computers . When you reach him tell him . Federation have agreed all terms . Will pay 100 million credits for Orac . What is Orac ? - He 's having a spasm , quickly ! - He won 't take the shocks . It 'll kill him . Without it he 'll die anyway . Come on . - He 's coming through . - That was close . Must get started . Yes , we 'll do everything we can . Now you must relax . - Must go . Now . So little time . - We 'll leave as soon as the others get back . No . Can 't wait . Go ! Now ! You must rest . Shhh . - Anything ? - Not a single trace . You ? - So what do we do now ? - Start again . Liberator . This is Avon . Do you hear me , Liberator ? - Avon . Have you found her yet ? - No . We 're going to start searching again . - Is there anything we can do ? - I 'm open to suggestions . If you haven 't found her in four hours , you come back . Cally and I will take over . - Whatever you say . - Just don 't give up on her . No . We won 't do that . Not yet . We 'll be in touch . Let 's get started . Must go . Now . If we delay any longer , we 'll be too late . One of my crew is lost on that planet . Right now finding her is all I care about . But he 'll die , if I don 't get to him . Don 't you understand ? My father will die ! Liberator is ten times faster than the ship you were travelling in . We will get there in time ! - But I can 't risk that ! We must go ! Now ! - No ! We 're staying here for as long as it takes . Keep back ! I 'll kill her . I mean it . Now you get this ship started Co-ordinates 11 , 2 , intersect 5 , 9 . Not a chance ! Do you think I 'll abandon my crew , leave them on the surface ? That 's their problem . Now you do as I tell you . I don 't want to harm either of you , but I will . I 'll kill her , and you . Her first , and then you . Don 't force me to do it . Get it started . Now ! Do it ! In flight and on your course . - Check it , on your computer . - Don 't you trust me ? Computers can 't lie . Put it online . Zen , confirm course . Liberator is on flight course coordinates 11 , 2 , intersect 5 , 9 . - Good . - Are we to stay like this for the whole flight ? I 've got no choice . I 'm sorry about that . The drugs I gave you keep back the pain . How long will you last once they wear off ? - I 'll manage . - You 'll get tired . The pain will start eating into you . Sooner or later you 'll lose concentration . We 'll need one second and then we 'll take you . Perhaps . But pick that second very carefully . Misjudge it ; you 'll both be dead . There 's no signal . No response at all . Try yours . Liberator ? Blake ? Cally ? Do you read our signal ? Respond ! Nothing . There can 't be a fault on both communicators . They must have moved out of range . Without warning us ? Why ? I wish we could ask them . There could be Federation ships in the area , I suppose . Meanwhile we 're stuck down here . That 's largely academic at the moment . Let 's hope they 're back when we find Jenna . We 'll cover the ground again , in that direction . [ COMMUNICATOR BEEP ] - Yes ? - Space Commander Travis is here . Send him in . You sent for me ? You 've lost some of your fire , Travis . Whatever happened to your pride ? My pride , Supreme Commander ? I ignored you . A calculated insult . You obviously recognised it as such . I did . And yet you remained silent . There was a time when you wouldn 't have taken an insult like that from anyone . Not even me . True . I want my command back . To get it I 'll do whatever 's necessary . If you think my silence is weakness , you mistake me . Better . I was afraid that the suspension , and the inquiry into your mishandling of the Blake affair might have broken your spirit . I don 't break that easily . You were expected to resign the service . Why didn 't you ? I 've told you , I want my command back . - It 's the only way I can catch ... - You really are obsessed with Blake , aren 't you ? It 's my right . It 's my intention that you should get another chance to exercise that right , and at the same time redeem your somewhat blemished record . However , there are more important things than Blake . Not for me . More immediate , then . Orac , for example . Orac ? There 've been rumours about it for years . A scientist called Ensor has been working on it . Despite considerable investigation , we 've never been able to locate him . - And you want me to find him for you ? - It 's no longer necessary . A little while ago , Ensor 's son came to see me . His father was ill . He needed medical help and equipment . While he was here , he showed me plans of his father 's creation Orac . It is a brilliant achievement . There is nothing else like it in the universe . And he wanted to sell it . Expensive , Travis . He wants 100 million . 100 million ? Are you sure whatever it is , is worth that much ? - It 's worth ten times that much . - Oh . - So I agreed to buy it . - Do you have the authority ? No . Listen Travis , I 've told no one of this . Ensor and his father live alone on the planet Aristo . He made it clear that if there was any attempt to take Orac by force , he would destroy it . - Would he do that ? - Oh , yes . He thought it through very carefully . He wouldn 't even reveal the location of the laboratory until I 'd agreed to all his terms . - Which were ? - A Space Surgeon was to go with him . I sent Maryatt . - How much did you tell him ? - Only what his orders were . He 's a good man . Maryatt was to remain with Ensor as a hostage until the transaction was complete . I was to take the 100 million in an unarmed ship , and in return I 'd get Maryatt and Orac . So now all you have to do is to persuade the Federation to let you spend 100 million . That could take years . - You have an alternative ? - Yes . It occurred to me that if Ensor didn 't get back in time , then in a very little while his father would die . So I took the precaution of placing a small explosive device in his ship . You said Maryatt was on board . Yes , that was unfortunate , but unavoidable , I 'm afraid . - Don 't you see ? - Orac is ours for the taking . - When do we leave ? - Start making arrangements , maximum security . No flight plan is to be filed . When we do leave it must be in total secrecy . However long it takes , Travis , you must cover our tracks completely . No one must know anything about it . Right . You 're almost as ruthless as I am . You underestimate me , Travis . It begins to look that way . - What 's the matter ? - Maryatt . - What about him ? - His disappearance ... there may be questions . In 12 hours I shall have him posted as a deserter . And his family go into slavery on one of the frontier worlds . - It is the normal procedure in a case of desertion . - Of course . - Maryatt was the medic that saved my life . - You 're wasting time . Does it matter ? No . No , only Blake matters now . - And Orac . - Right . [ LASER BLAST ] Let 's get out of here ! There 's hordes of them ! And they don 't seem to like us much ! How can you tell ? See if you can open the door . I can 't do it ! Gan ! Who are you ? And you shall answer . - My name is Meegat , Lord . - " Lord " ? - You opened the door ? - I opened the door . We 're grateful . We seem to have made a few enemies outside . That my Lord might find safety from his enemies . - Well , she seems to be on our side . - Yes , but the poor woman 's insane . Not necessarily . Get back in your place . I will describe the way to the scavengers ' camp so that you may rescue your follower . My follower ? I never really thought of her in those terms . Are you alone here ? Yes , Lord . Everything is as it was written . One waits . - For what ? - For you . - I told you she was mad . - How long have you been waiting ? All of my life , as those before me waited . But it is I who welcome you . Welcome , Lord , welcome ! Yes , well , let 's not start all that again . - You 've hurt her feelings now . - I have offended you . - No , you haven 't offended me . - Forgive me ! I forgive you . You 're enjoying this , aren 't you ? Probably . How many of your people are there ? Less than 100 now . Our numbers grow smaller . More die . - And the scavengers ? - Perhaps twice as many , but they too are dying . We expected you to come long ago . Most of this stuff looks operational . There 's no sign of any damage . You have a technology like this and still get your light from those ? - Technology ? - All this . - But it does not provide light . - Well , it could , Meegat , if it was working . Of course . That 's why they were waiting for us . All things are known to you . You are truly Lord . Counting yourself , that makes two people who think you 're wonderful . Tell me about the prophecy . The ancients promised that strangers not of this world would be the means of our deliverance . Meegat , we 're not really gods from the skies , you know . We 're just men from a spacecraft . - With problems of our own . - You have come . The waiting is over . As it was promised , the Lord Avon will save our race . Look at this . A chemical rocket in launch position . He shall recognise deliverance and speak its name . He shall speak its name as a thing known and understood . As to him all things are known and understood . Been alone too long , definitely . - Is there a legend of deliverance ? - Yes , Lord . - Tell me about it . - But you know it . Well , tell me about it anyway . Our fathers fought a Great War , and Kashell the Wise dreamed that all life would end in this place . - Seems he was right . - So Kashell sought a way to preserve our race . A way for it to survive in a new place among the stars . And the way was found . That ship couldn 't carry enough people to establish a new community . It could carry dormant cells . Genetic banks and brood units . Like those in the projectile we took on board the Liberator ? The same principle , yes . These seem to be a little more advanced , though . But did they do it ? " And the way was found " Does it go on ? Deliverance was prepared . And Kashell the Wise was satisfied that it was good . If there are cells on that ship , would they still be viable ? I mean , could they be incubated into a new race of men after all these years ? Theoretically the fertility span would be unlimited . The brood units would activate on landing . If they set it up right , there 's no reason why it shouldn 't still work . Go on . All that was needed to complete deliverance was the word of Kashell . But our fathers killed him , and the word was forgotten . And so we wait for a new word from beyond the stars . We wait for deliverance . We wait for the nameless Lord whose name shall be spoken by the one who waits . Meegat speaks his name . His name is Avon . Avon ! - It 's an active power source register . - That 's what I thought . The automatics have closed it down . Well , if we could find the manual override we should be able to reactivate it . Output control is locked . There 's a circuit breaker here . Try the output control now . - It 's free . - This alpha scale is registering . - Take it to level one , see what we get . - No , nothing 's showing . Then there must be a secondary fail-safe . Try it again , Gan . - It 's coming in ! - Take it to level two . Level two , and we have power . Let me see now . Telemetry and guidance are holding systems rebalance fuel and ignition capability is green inboard computers are green and functioning . Programs are stable . It 's coming in ! Payload environment is solid and stable . Count is T-minus sixty and holding . telemetry and guidance are green and balanced . Behold , deliverance ! Secondary stage is go for count payload is go for count meteorology checks confirmed , go for count gantry systems are cleared , green , and stable count is T-minus Do you really think we could launch that ship ? If the people who built it did their job properly , I don 't see any reason why not . And it does seem we have a reputation to live up to . Oh , you certainly do , Lord Avon . I wonder why she picked on you ? Well , now , you are hardly the stuff that gods are made of . - And you are , I suppose ? - Apparently . Look , before we try to fulfil any more prophecies , could we uh . Yes . We must find Jenna . I 've put the energiser onto automatic . If I let it go , it will spring back and the gun will fire . If I pass out , the gun will fire by itself . Now you make certain that I don 't go to sleep . - If she is alive , you will find her . - If she is alive . - Well , are we ready ? - We 're ready . I will await your return . You 'll wait up there by the door ? - If we make it , we 'll be back . - The Lord Avon will protect you . - Meegat . - Lord ? Make sure that it is us before you open the door . The scavengers know about it now . Vila and I will go round and take a closer look . You stay here . If it comes to killing , remember my limiter implant . I 'll stay up here if you like . You keep a watch . I 'll try and find her . There 's shelter this way . We 'll be safe there . - That was close ! - No respect . They obviously didn 't realise who you were . Thank you . You all right ? You know , Vila , for a minute out there , I was actually beginning to enjoy myself . You 're as mad as Meegat . Cally ! [ LASER BLAST ] You all right ? Yes . Yes , I think so . He 's almost gone . The micro cells get to father Orac . He 's dead . What is Orac ? I don 't know . If we deliver these , perhaps we 'll find out . Got to get the others first . Zen , direct route for the planet Cephlon . Maximum speed . Confirmed . Avon , look at this . It 's a sub beam communications system . - It 's an interesting antique . - Look at the range scales . Yes . Liberator can receive and transmit sub beam . Try it . Right . I think everything is functional . We are ready for countdown . Liberator , this is Jenna . Do you read me , Liberator ? - We read you , Jenna . Are you all right ? - I 'm safe and well . What happened to you ? A slight detour . We 'll tell you when we see you . We 'll be in teleport range in about four hours . We 'll be waiting . In the meantime , Avon 's about to become a legend . - What ? - Out . - They 're on their way . - So are they . Ten Nine Eight Seven Six Five Four Three Two One We have lift off Meegat , I 'm sorry you 've waited so long . Our waiting brought you . That seems like a poor reward , somehow . The rocket is now beyond sensor range . Have the navigation computers made a projection ? It is calculated that the rocket will make planetfall in the system Magdalen Alpha . How many suitable planets are there in that system ? There are four with compatible biospheres . Flight time ? Five hundred earth years . You won 't be a legend in your own lifetime , then . Fertility cells wouldn 't know about us , anyway . Meegat does . Did she really think you were a god ? For a while . - How did it feel ? - Don 't you know ? Yes . I don 't like the responsibility , either . Now we have another . Ensor 's father . Zen , have you laid in a course for Aristo ? Course for the planet Aristo is computed and laid in . Speed standard by six , Jenna . Standard by six .

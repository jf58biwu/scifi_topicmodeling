 300MB UNITED TEAM - sunmenghao How we doing , Richard ? We should pass over the english coast 1 5 minutes ahead of time . With this load on our back , that 's good going . Just trust the RAF , sir . - What the hell is that ? - The shuttle ignition . Disappeared ? And what happened to the Moonraker ? Good God . Yes , of course , minister . Right away . Moneypenny , is 00 7 back from that African job ? He 's on his last leg , sir . Any higher , Mr. Bond , my ears will pop . I don 't think I 'm ever going to fly with anyone else . You 're so right , Mr. Bond . This is where we leave you , Mr. Bond . A little premature , isn 't it ? Enjoy your flight . Good morning , Moneypenny . James . But why are you so late ? I fell out of an airplane without a parachute . - Who 's in there ? - Q and the minister of defense . You don 't believe me , do you ? - And you should go right in . - Yes , Moneypenny . 00 7 . - At last . - Good morning , sir . You know Frederick Gray , minister of defense . - Commander . - Minister . Q. 00 7 . Moonraker ? What do you know about it ? What I read in the newspaper , sir . Then you 'II know that Moonraker was being flown over here on Ioan from the Americans on top of a 7 4 7 . And crashed somewhere in the Yukon . Aircraft and shuttle totally destroyed , correct ? - That 's the official version . - The truth is rather disturbing , 00 7 . Look at this . That 's the scene of the crash . Wreckage strewn over a Iarge area . That 's all that 's left of the fuselage . We 've been through it thoroughly but there 's no sign of Moonraker . Are you suggesting the shuttle was hijacked in midair ? That 's for you to find out , 00 7 . shuttle 's built in california by Drax Industries . Yes . We were responsible for the safety of that shuttle , commander . The United States government is justifiably concerned . I can imagine . - california 's the place to start . - I agree . Don 't make any mistakes , 00 7 . The situation is critical . - We 've got to find that shuttle . - Yes , sir . If that 's all , gentlemen ... . Just a minute , 00 7 . I 've got something for you . roll up your right sleeve , will you ? This is now being issued as standard equipment . Strap it on your wrist . It 's activated by nerve impulses from the wrist muscles . Like this ? Oh , thank you , 00 7 ! - Be careful , will you ? - Yes , Q. Ten darts : five bIue-tipped with armor-piercing heads five red-tipped , cyanide coated , causing death in 30 seconds . Very novel , Q. You must get them in the stores for Christmas . Good morning , gentlemen . - welcome to california , Mr. Bond . - I Iike it already . My name is Corinne Dufour . You 're going to be showing me around ? No , I 'm just a humble pilot in the service of the Drax Corporation . This is the Drax estate now . Everything you see belongs to Mr. Drax . Owns a Iot , doesn 't he ? What he doesn 't own , he doesn 't want . We 're approaching the main complex now . That 's where the Moonraker shuttle is made ? That 's right . Workshops , hangars design and experimental blocks , test centers , everything . Very impressive . I 'd heard that Hugo Drax is obsessed with the conquest of space . Now I can believe it . Good God . The Drax residence . Every stone brought from France . Cute , isn 't it ? Magnificent . Why didn 't he buy the eiffel Tower as well ? He did , but the French government refused him an export permit . Look there . Those are the astronaut trainees . Mr. Drax is financing the training program out of his own pocket . He seems to have an eye for a good investment . Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond in the drawing room , Miss Dufour . - Thank you , Cavendish . - This way , please , sir . Mr. Bond , sir . - Mr . Bond . - Mr . Drax . allow me to present , before they leave us , Countess Lubinski Lady Victoria Devon , Mr. Bond . How do you do ? My dear fellow , your reputation precedes you , of course . I 'm honored your government should send you on so delicate a mission . " delicate , " Mr. Drax ? well , to apologize in person for the loss of my space shuttle . How would Oscar wilde have put it : " To lose one aircraft may be regarded as a misfortune to lose two seems like carelessness " ? well , an apology will be made to the American government , Mr. Drax when we 've discovered why there was no trace of the Moonraker . And your loyalty commands respect , Mr. Bond . You have arrived at a propitious moment coincident with your country 's one indisputable contribution to Western civilization . Afternoon tea . May I press you to a cucumber sandwich ? Thank you , no , nothing at all . The shuttle , is it made entirely here in california ? No . I own subsidiaries throughout the world , producing components . The conquest of space represents an investment in the future of the entire human race , Mr. Bond . It is therefore logical to seek the best that each nation has to offer . Are you referring to people or skills ? Both , Mr. Bond . Am I too soon ? Not at all . I 'm sure Mr. Bond is eager to start his tour . Miss Dufour will escort you to Dr. Goodhead , who will show you around . Ask anything you Iike . - Thank you for being so cooperative . - A pleasure . Look after Mr. Bond . See that some harm comes to him . You 'II find Dr. Goodhead first on the right . Thank you for the ride . call on me if you need anything . Good afternoon . - Can I help you ? - Yes . My name is Bond . James Bond . I 'm looking for Dr. Goodhead . You just found her . A woman . Your powers of observation do you credit , Mr. Bond . James , to my friends . holly Goodhead . Are you training to be an astronaut ? I 'm fully trained . On Ioan from NASA the Space Administration . well , Mr. Bond , I guess we 'd better get started . You don 't want to lose time as well as the space shuttle , do you ? This is it , the Moonraker . capable of being launched into space by rocket or- - Orbiting the Earth and reentering the atmosphere to land like any conventional aircraft . This is the centrifuge trainer . It simulates the gravity force you feel when shot into space . The speed is controlled by the instructor from up there . Why not try it ? Why not ? Strap yourself in firmly . Yes , doctor . Now , your arms . That 's to prevent you from knocking yourself out . I see . How fast does it go ? It can go up to 20 Gs but that would be fatal . 3 Gs is equivalent to takeoff pressure . Most people pass out at 7 . You 'd make a great saIeswoman . You don 't have to worry . This is what we call a " chicken switch . " Just keep your finger on that button and when the pressure is too much for you hit the button and the power 's cut off . Just like that ? Come on , Mr. Bond . A 70-year-oId can take 3 Gs . trouble is , there is never a 70-year-oId around when you need one . - You want me ? - Mr . Drax says to telephone him . AII right , I 'II call him from my office . You go ahead . I 'II be right back . The instructor will supervise the session . Enjoy yourself . Yes . We 're taking good care of him . I don 't know what could 've happened . Something must 've gone wrong with the controls . Let me help you . My mother gave me a list of things not to do on a first date . Maybe you won 't need it . It 's not what I came for . No . What do you want , then ? would your feelings be shattered if I were to say , " Information " ? Why should I tell you anything ? Why , indeed ? You presume a great deal , Mr. Bond . What goes on here besides the manufacture of Moonraker and the astronaut training program ? There are other laboratories , and not much is happening now . They were working on something very secret , but everything 's been moved . Where to ? I don 't know . What about that list of your mother 's ? I never learned to read . What are you doing ? You whetted my appetite for information . Is there a safe in here ? Thank you . James , no ! That 's amazing ! There you are , you see ? You have a heart of gold . Eighteen karat . You must go . No , you go first . I 'II turn off the lights . Thank you . - Take care of yourself . - And you . Ah , my dear Bond . This is MademoiseIIe DeIadier and La Signorina del Mateo . - Ladies . - I 'II see you at lunch . A pity you leave us . Such good sport . - unless you 're a pheasant . - Ah , really , Mr. Bond . Take my gun . A stray bird may fly over . I came to thank you for your hospitality . Frasier will get you to the airport in plenty of time . Come now . I doubt if I 'm in your class . Oh , you 're too modest , Mr. Bond . Over there . You missed , Mr. Bond . Did I ? As you said " Such good sport . " You called for me , Mr. Drax ? You were with Bond last night in my study . - You showed him the safe . - I didn 't ! I 'm terminating your employment . You will leave immediately . Franco , I 'II call you where to meet me . Can I interest you in something ? Why , I 'm tempted to say yes immediately . But I think I 'II have a look around . please . Go anywhere you wish . - -and in 1 965 , the Venini Museum and Glass Works were taken over by Drax Industries . Here we have some of the rarest examples of the glass blower 's art . As you know , everything was done absolutely by hand . Here is a vase done by Lorenzo Graziati sometime between 1 850 and 1 860 . If you 'd Iike to follow me over here ... . This exquisite bowl was fashioned about 1 520 over 450 years ago . If it ever came on the market , it wouId certainly fetch a price in excess of one million American dollars . But if any of you were thinking of taking it ... . We have an early seventh-century dish with an aquamarine medallion . Over here , we have something very , very interesting . This gIass-handIed sword the only one of its kind in the world was owned by general Menotti in the late eighteenth century and is the work of Bruno Venini , founder of this establishment . Fourteenth century . Dr. Goodhead . I can only hope your presence here is a coincidence , Mr. Bond . I dislike being spied on . well , don 't we all . You 're staying at the DanieIi , aren 't you ? Yes . How did you know ? I Iike to keep abreast of things . May I ask what you 're doing in Venice ? I 'm addressing a seminar of the European Space Commission . My , heady stuff . I keep forgetting that you are more than just a beautiful woman . If you 're trying to be ingratiating , Mr. Bond , don 't bother . I have more important things on my mind . That 's what I want to talk to you about . Dinner this evening ? This evening I 'm giving my address . Can you think of a reason why we don 't have a drink afterwards ? Not immediately . But I 'm sure I shall . play it again , Sam . - What the hell are you doing here ? - ConvaIescing . Your friend Cha just tried to kill me . I had something to do with it ? well , the thought had flashed across my mind . What 's Drax up to in that laboratory ? Why don 't you ask him yourself ? You leaving me your telephone number ? I don 't see the point . Ah , now I do . Not what I want to get stuck with tonight . James , why don 't you pour yourself a drink ? Thank you . " daily diary . " fairly deadly diary . BoIIinger . If it 's ' 69 , you were expecting me . TrifIe overpowering , your scent . Standard CIA equipment . And the CIA placed you with Drax , correct ? - Very astute of you , James . - Oh , not really . I have friends in Iow places . could this possibly be the moment for us to pool our resources ? It could have its compensations . Where are you planning on going from here ? I 'm not planning on going anywhere . Oh , I suppose you 're right , holly . We 'd be better off working together . Detente ? Agreed . Understanding ? possibly . Cooperation ? Maybe . Trust ? Out of the question . Send the night porter up for my bags immediately , please . I hope you know what you 're doing . I played bridge with this fellow . 00 7 doesn 't usually push the panic button unless it 's something serious . - I hope not . - Morning , inspector . I see you 've covered everything with our italian friends . - Is this it ? - Yes , sir . Gas masks ? We can 't afford to take any chances , minister . Frederick Gray . What a surprise ! And in distinguished company , all wearing gas masks . You must excuse me , gentlemen , not being english I sometimes find your sense of humor rather difficult to follow . On behalf of the British government , I apologize . I think you owe us an explanation , 00 7 . I 've never been so humiliated in my Iife . Your man should be taken off the assignment . I 'II see you at the consulate . I 'II have to do what he says . well , before you do that , sir have Q do an analysis of this . I took it from the laboratory . tell him to exercise extreme caution . It is lethal . So there was a laboratory . You 'd better take two weeks leave of absence , 00 7 . Do you know where you might go ? I 've always had a hankering to go to Rio . I think I can recall your mentioning it . 00 7 , no sIip-ups or we 're both in trouble . Yes , a minor crisis has been averted . Nothing serious , but all merchandise is to be rerouted as from today . Now , regarding a replacement for Cha do you have someone in mind ? Oh , yes , well , if you can get him , of course . Flight BA 1 28 to Rio de Janeiro now boarding , gate number seven . welcome to Rio , Mr. Bond . The president 's suite . really ? Don 't bother showing me the rest . If I get lost , I 'II take a cab . Do you come with the suite ? It depends who 's renting it . Vodka martini ? Shaken , not stirred . Why were you following me from the airport ? I was trying to meet you . My name is ManueIa . I work for Station VH . We have been asked to assist you . M thinks of everything . tell me , ManueIa , do the initials C and W mean anything to you ? C and W ? Yes , carlos and WiImsberg . They are very big importers in Rio . A subsidiary of the Drax Group , I believe . They have a warehouse on Carioca Avenue . I 'd Iike to pay it a discreet visit tonight . Tonight ? I think you may find that a little difficult . difficult or not it 's something we have to do . And meanwhile ... . How do you kill five hours in Rio , if you don 't samba ? There 's the warehouse . And not a soul about . - There 's a way around the back . - Good thinking . This is it . Don 't talk to any strange men . I 'II be back . Are you all right ? Yes , but I 'd rather dance with you . I did tell you not to talk to any strange men . Did you find anything in there ? only this . " Drax Air Freight . " - Which airport do they operate from ? - San Pietro . Do you want me to take you there ? No , I think you need some rest . Come on . I 'II drop you off . Haven 't we met before somewhere ? The face is familiar as is the manner . It 's become distinctly chilly since Venice . That was before you walked out . nearly tripping on your bags on the way out the door . So ? So why waste time working against each other ? I 've checked Drax 's warehouse in town . It 's empty . That 's no surprise . Those planes have been taking off every two hours . Yes . He 's moving out . Where to ? That 's what we 're going to find out , now that we 're working together . I still don 't know if I trust you . I don 't know if I trust you either . That 's what makes it more exciting , doesn 't it ? What 's wrong ? I don 't know . But I 'm sure we 're better off out than in . Bring that chain . Hang on , James ! The thought had occurred to me . I might have guessed . - Do you know him ? - Not socially . His name 's Jaws . He kills people . Here , give me the chain . Come on ! Hang on to me . Jump ! - Have you broken something ? - only my tailor 's heart . What was that for ? For saving my Iife . Remind me to do it more often . Thanks , but we 're in great shape . Sorry about that . James ! You look as though you just fell off a mountain . It 's funny you should say that , Moneypenny . As a matter of fact , I was in a cable car and- - - Never mind . - The other courtyard . Ah , there you are , 00 7 . balls , Q ? Bolas , 00 7 . Good . Have that ready for Army Day . - Where 's M ? - In the office . This way . - Good morning , 00 7 . - Good morning , sir . You 're just in time . Sit down . Thank you , sir . Q 's come up with something . splendid . Any news of Dr. Goodhead ? Afraid not . Right , Q. It 's a breakdown on that vial of liquid you picked up in Venice . - You seem to be right , 00 7 . - Thank you . It 's a highly toxic nerve gas that appears to have no effect on animals . May I see the formula ? It 's a chemical formula of a plant . Orchideae negra . A very rare orchid indeed . Yes . It was thought to be extinct until a missionary brought one back from the reaches of the Amazoco . well , actually he brought it back from the area of the River Tapirape . well done , James . You better get up there , and fast . And I 've got something to get him there if 00 7 can be trusted to look after it . Mr. Bond you defy all my attempts to plan an amusing death for you . You 're not a sportsman . Why did you break off the encounter with my pet python ? I discovered he had a crush on me . Jaws . Moonraker One on preset launch program , minus two minutes .

U. activated . - LH2 replenish . - Status confirmed . - Pressurize MPS helium tanks . Helium flight pressure confirmed . What exactly are you up to here , Drax ? And why the orchids ? The curse of a civilization . It was neither war nor pestilence that wiped out the race who built the great city lying around us . It was their reverence for this lovely flower . Because Iong-term exposure to its pollen caused sterility . Correct , Mr. Bond . As you discovered , I have improved upon sterility . Those same seeds now yield death . Not , of course , to animals or plant life . One must preserve the balance of nature . Moonraker launch program now commencing . Minus 20 seconds . - SRB gimbal profile . - Activated . - Cooling pumps . - On . - IMU to inertial . - IMU confirmed . Moonraker One , Iiftoff . We have liftoff .

That 's Drax in Moonraker Five . - What about the others ? - I don 't know . Let 's see . We 're all on parallel courses . We must be headed for a rendezvous in orbit . Let 's see what cargo we have . " And the animals went in two by two . " What do you mean by that ? Noah 's ark . This operation . We 're converging . - control rockets ? - Yes , we 're slowing down now . What 's that ? There 's no image on radar . An entire city in space . And still nothing on the radar scanner . So nobody on Earth knows it 's there . Right . Drax must have a radar jamming system . All Moonrakers prepare to initiate docking procedures and continue radio silence . Moonraker Six , you are now in manual . Initiate docking sequence . All shuttles now docked . Execute station activation procedure . Gravity , normal conditions . Life-support system , nominal . Moonraker Six technicians , commence operational sequence . - Sequence four initiated . - Check air lock seals . ALS secure . All personnel to command satellite . All personnel to command satellite .

Those are the globes I saw in Venice with the nerve-gas vials inside . First there was a dream . Now there is reality . Here , in the untainted cradle of the heavens will be created a new super-race a race of perfect physical specimens . You have been selected as its progenitors . Like gods your offspring will return to Earth and shape it in their image . You have all served in humble capacities in my terrestrial empire . Your seed , Iike yourselves , will pay deference to the ultimate dynasty which I alone have created . From their first day on Earth they will be able to look up and know that there is law and order in the heavens . All units , start Operation Orchid . If we were visible from Earth , they 'd investigate . Where do you suppose that radar jamming system is ? We didn 't pass anything on the way here , so ... . Let 's try this way . Station two , check coordinates , mode four . Initiate globe launch timing sequence . orbital communicator , level 1 0 . Zero gravity . This is it the radar jamming system . Check . Coordinate conversion program . Check . Side lobe again . Spectral response . Spin stabilizer , correction factor . Gigahertz reflector efficiency . Solar photon screen . Where did you learn to fight ? NASA ? No , Vassar . - Switched off ? - permanently . Now we 'II be seen from Earth . - It doesn 't look good at all . - It 's over 200 meters in diameter . will you please listen , general ? We didn 't put it there . Neither did we , colonel Scott . So , what are you suggesting ? We 've taken action . We 're sending a vehicle to intercept . Very well . But if we don 't hear from you in 1 2 hours we act ourselves and hold you responsible for the consequences . We 'II be in touch , general . Sorry to have woken you . Oh , I was already awake . How can I sleep ? Nothing but problems . problems problems . Three astronauts to launch pad . Launch-B program complete , sir . Launch globe number one . TDRSS reports a launch , sir . continental USA , Vandenberg . And no launch is scheduled . Check radar jamming system . well ? Jamming power supply and backup have failed , sir . - Investigate immediately . - Investigate number 28 immediately . James Bond . You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season . I didn 't think there were any seasons in space . As far as you 're concerned , only winter . And the treacherous Dr. Goodhead . Despite your efforts , my finely wrought dream approaches fulfillment . Your dream , whatever sort of nightmare it is , hasn 't a chance . You think not ? We shall see . We 're coming up to second launch position . Launch globe number 2 . No doubt you have realized the splendor of my conception . First , a necklace of death about the Earth . 50 globes , each releasing its nerve gas over a designated area . Each capable of killing 1 00 million people . And the human race , as you know it will cease to exist . Then , a rebirth . A new world . U.S. spacecraft on course to intercept us , sir . Activate laser . Prepare to destroy spacecraft . You see , we 're well able to protect ourselves against all enemies . allow me to introduce you to the air-Iock chamber . Observe , Mr. Bond , your route from this world to the next . And you , Dr. Goodhead . Your desire to be America 's first woman in space will shortly be fulfilled . Leaving you on your flying stud farm conceiving your new master race . If you Iike , yes . And of course , anyone not measuring up to your standards of physical perfection will be exterminated . certainly . Interesting . - Most interesting . - Jaws . expel them . You obey me ! expel them ! hold them ! U.S. spacecraft , three minutes to intercept . Stand by to laser it . Initiate firing sequence . - Initiated . - U.S. spacecraft in laser range- - Range 1 5 . Range 1 0 . Prepare to fire . 5 , 4 3 , 2 , 1- - It 's stopped rotating . Open the cargo doors . Number 1 platoon , E.V.A. Number 1 platoon , E. V.A. Red leader , stand by . White Leader , support Red Platoon . Let 's try docking . Take the first landing ! Intruders have docked at satellite seven , sir . double the guards at every entrance in this satellite . Report intruders ' progress throughout the space station . Number three globe ready for launching , sir . Proceed ! - Intruders attacking command module . - Group One , attack enemy . All units , shoot to kill . - colonel Scott , don 't shoot . - hold your fire ! Corridor five , penetrated . Intruders advancing on command satellite . Maintenance crew needed , section three . At least I shall have the pleasure of putting you out of my misery . DesoIated , Mr. Bond ? Heartbroken , Mr. Drax . allow me . Take a giant step for mankind . Where 's Drax ? Oh , he had to fly . - How 's Scott doing ? - He 's got the command satellite . The globe launching gear is shut down . When the station breaks up , they 'II disintegrate . But the 3 that left will kill millions . Those 3 must be destroyed . Come on ! colonel , get your men off , quickly ! Mission is completed . Sergeant , get your men back to the shuttle ! Back to the shuttle , everybody . On the double ! Moonraker Five . Drax 's shuttle is armed with a laser . We can track the globes and destroy them . It 's hopeless , sir . The corridor 's blocked . - They can 't get to us now . - AII right , Iet 's go . Docking release system is jammed . release the door lock . I 'II see if I can operate it manually . It 's jammed too . well , here 's to us . Jaws ? We can 't disengage . The release system is jammed . Can you help ? We 're free . Don 't worry , they 'II make it . It 's only 1 00 miles to Earth . Let 's get a readout on the globes . I have the globes on the screen . We 'II have visual in a minute . There it is . The laser 's on automatic . Code 9-4-5 . Set . One down , two to go . Number two , straight ahead . - What is it ? - We 're skipping on the atmosphere . In range . We should see the Iast one soon . There it is . - It 's getting hot . - It can 't be helped . I 'm coming in steeper than I should to catch that last globe . I can 't hold this course much longer . We 'II break up at 200,000 feet . Just a few seconds more . Automatic firing system negative . Must be the heat . Switching to manual . controls aren 't responding . - The wings are beginning to glow . - Just hold it steady . Steady . It 's entering the Earth 's atmosphere . James , this is our last chance . Steady ... . colonel Scott picked up two survivors from the space station : A tall man and a short blond woman . Right . Okay . Dr. Goodhead reported their position 20 minutes ago . They 're coming into range of our tracking ship in the Pacific . We should have audio-visuaI in minutes from the onboard monitors . Houston calling Dr. Goodhead . Houston calling . Confirm your position . As this is the first joint venture between our two countries I 'm patching it directly to the White House and Buckingham palace . well , I 'm sure Her Majesty will be fascinated . - We have audio-visuaI . - Ah , at last ! My God ! What 's Bond doing ? I think he 's attempting reentry , sir . I think it may be time to go home . Take me around the world one more time . Why not ?

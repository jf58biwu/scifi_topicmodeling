 There it is . The Federation ship bringing in prisoners . - Prisoners ? - New souls for the faith . - How long before we make planet fall , Mr Artix ? - I 'll run a check . - Are the prisoners quiet ? - Yes , sir . 48 minutes 30 seconds . They 're suppressed and under constant scan . Security have put on double guards and I 've armed the crew as well , just as you 've instructed . All a bit late in the day , too . It doesn 't look very hospitable , sir . What ? Cygnus Alpha . It doesn 't look very hospitable , sir . I want you to send this report . Beam it to the nearest Federation base for relay to Earth . It 's not going to do much for my promotion prospects , sir . You can live down your part of it . You 're young . Send it , Mr Artix . This is Civil Administration Ship London in transit from Earth to Cygnus Alpha , transporting prisoners . We have sustained crew casualties during an attempted mutiny by prisoners . Five dead , including Sub commander Raiker . Three prisoners escaped in a spacecraft of unknown origin . Prisoners Blake , Stannis , and Avon . The London is again under authorised control and proceeding to destination . Message ends . Retransmit to Earth on priority circuit . Confirm please . We have confirmation . Will they go after Blake ? They have no choice . They 'll never find him out there . I said , sir , they 'll never find him out there . They won 't have to . He 'll find them . Everything ok ? I think so . Whoever they were , they certainly knew something about engineering . I 'd feel a lot happier if we knew what had happened to them . Blake , what do you make of this ? - Some sort of storage space . - Possibly . Careful . Handgun ? It 's a bit elaborate for a toothpick . Depends how elaborate their teeth were . Ow ! That one 's hot . No it isn 't . That one is , though . Jenna ? What is it ? Seems to be an armoury . Take that one there . - Be careful though . It may be hot . - No , I don 't think so . - No , it isn 't - Single function isomorphic response . What ? I think he means it 'll only let us have one gun each . It certainly gives one a feeling of independence . - What does ? - This . - You 're a free man . - That 's right . So I am . How does she handle , Jenna ? A bit scary . It 's almost as if she were alive . Well , I must say all this technology has an organic feel about it . It 's not just advanced . It 's ... - ... conceptually alien ? - Yes There are a lot of controls that I haven 't dared touch yet . Well , I doubt whether we 'd understand the manuals , so go ahead and try one . Don 't blame me if it 's self destruct . I doubt if I 'll ever speak to you again . Ok , here we go . That was quite a trip . There was certainly a lot of power in it . Did you get a blackout effect ? Yes . So did I. Negative hyperspace . - You mean we crossed the anti-matter interface ? - That 's impossible . - That 's what they said about the light barrier . Well , which one next ? Try that one . - Something of an anti-climax . - Blake , I can 't move my hand . - Don 't touch her . It 's as though my hand was part of something else . It 's it 's in my head . Something in my mind . Asking . Answering . No . Ah , it 's so peaceful , it 's beautiful , to be completely known . It 's like innocence . Welcome , Jenna Stannis . Who is it ? Zen . Welcome , Roj Blake . Where are you ? Show yourself . Your species requires a visual reference point . Blake . This is your reference point . - You 're a computer . - As you say , Kerr Avon . Who owns this ship ? Where are they ? The navigation units will accept your spoken commands . Please state speed and course . I want a course for the Earth Federation penal planet , Cygnus Alpha . Galactic centre coordinates are confirmed . - Speed ? - Standard ? - Standard speed Confirmed . That 's done it . It seems we 're on course now . It deliberately ignored your questions . A computer can 't have a will of it 's own . You 'd better tell Zen that . - Let 's look around the rest of this ship we 've stolen . - Salvaged . - Why don 't we just interrogate Zen ? - Even if he 'd answer ... - I 'll make it answer . I 'd still prefer to find out for myself I 'm not sure I entirely trust a computer with a mind of it 's own . I don 't think it means us any harm . - It has no feelings about us at all . It 's just a machine . - If you say so . Either way , it 'll keep . Come on . Go to Him and tell Him new bounty has come from the darkness . I will go to the place of rebirth . Berthing sequence automatic committed . 171615 . Landing beam alignment confirmed . 141312 . Check main retro drive . 1110 . Entering silo . We have ground zero contact . All off . All off , sir . Disembark the prisoners , Mr Artix . Maintain full security until they 're in the holding bay . I 'll program the computer for the return . We lift off in D plus 30 . 30 minutes ? Sir , we 've been in space now for 8 months . I wouldn 't mind stretching my legs a little . Not on this planet Mr Artix . Now get the prisoners off and let 's go home . Yes , sir . We have sustained crew casualties during attempted mutiny by prisoners . Five dead including Sub commander Raiker . Three prisoners escaped in a spacecraft of unknown origin Prisoners Blake , Stannis and Avon . Avon . What do you think ? Before I decided to put my talents to more profitable use ... And got arrested , I handled the computer analysis for a research project into matter transmission . It was based on a new alloy . Aquitar . That 's right . - Yes , I worked on that project too . - Small world . - Large project . I didn 't work on it . The molecular structure of Aquitar appeared to contain the key to the transmission of matter as pure energy . Instant transportation . Send solid objects like radio signals . Trouble was it seldom worked . And on living matter it never worked . Put a living creature into one end ; take a dead creature out of the other , or nothing at all . So you think that is what all this is for ? Matter transmission ? These bracelets contain Aquitar , or something very like it . [ WHIRR ] What 's that ? Check it , would you ? The question is , have they solved the problem of living matter ? And if they have , could we teleport down to the surface of the planet without ever having to land the ship ? Too many " ifs " for my taste . Presumably these are part of the recall system . This looks like a communicator . Hello . Testing One Two Three . Seems to work all right . Tuned to transmit directly to the ship . Let 's ask the computer how the system works . - Blake I think you 'd better come . - What 's happened ? - We 've stopped Everything 's gone dead . Zen . Please state speed and course . Cygnus Alpha , standard speed . Completed The Liberator is in stationary orbit , one thousand spacials above the planet 's surface . I see . The " Liberator " ? He got that from me . It was something I was thinking . - Your thought was accepted . - Show us the planet . - You require the remote visualisation unit ? - Yes . - Please look at the screen . So that 's where we would have spent the rest of our lives . What now ? We 've got to go down there and rescue the others . You 're not going to try and land this thing ? What 's the alternative ? Leave . I 'm free , and I intend to stay that way . And I need a crew . Zen , how does the teleport system work ? Would its function be injurious to our species ? Have you the necessary data ? Wisdom must be gathered , it cannot be given . Don 't philosophise with me you electronic moron . Answer the question . ZEN ! ZEN ! I don 't think he likes you , somehow . I think I may have to reprogram this machine . That still won 't make you likeable . Avon 's right , we can 't land the ship . I 'm going to have to risk the teleport system . Come on . Come on , move it . Hurry . Move it . - Guard , double check that the prisoners are secure . - Yes , sir . Move it . What happens now , then ? This is nice , isn 't it ? What a miserable hole If we all complained do you think they 'd give us a refund ? Shut up . Can 't you see the funny side of it ? Have you heard this one ? There was a young lady from Cygnus , who thought that ... Are you going to shut your mouth or have I got to do it for you ? Only if you 're lying down , cause if you touch him again , I 'm going to break your arms and legs off . Why do you suppose they put us down here ? Just a holding area . Don 't worry about this place . It 's what 's on the other side of that that bothers me . What do you think it will be like , Arco ? How should I know ? It won 't be good will it ? They don 't put penal colonies on easy living planets . What about guards , authorities ? Why should they bother ? It 's a long walk back . - Well , why are they keeping us here ? - Relax . - This is probably the nicest place on the planet . Listen . They 're getting ready to lift off . - Can you see anything ? - Some sort of passage . Cold as a corpse 's armpit . What 's that smell ? It 's like something rotting . Dinner probably . [ ENGINE NOISE ] Release prisoners . What now ? What else is there ? We don 't have much choice do we ? There 's someone there . Look . Where ? Someone is beckoning . Do you see it , Gan ? It 's gone . - I didn 't see anybody . - You must have done . - I tell you I didn 't . You 're so scared your brain 's curdling . Did you see it ? I saw something . There you are . We 're going to have to see what 's out there sooner or later . Let 's all go . Uh no , on the other hand , let 's all stay . I 'll take a look . Gan You all right ? Gan ? He might be in trouble . Come on . Shouldn 't we wait a bit longer ? He might be all right . If he isn 't , what chance do the rest of us stand ? Come on . Wouldn 't it be better if we all stayed together ? Arco . Great oaf . Why couldn 't he stay here ? Arco ! Gan . Gan . What is it ? What is it ? - You got it worked out yet ? - Educated guesses I can 't be certain . - Let 's see how educated your guesses are . - I still think this is a stupid risk . Which I 'm taking . So let 's get on with it . Give me 4 minutes . After that , start making educated guesses as to how to get me back again . Good luck . All right , Avon Let 's get started . [ TELEPORT WHINE ] Jenna , it appears to have worked . Start counting . 4 minutes . A deserter . Kill him . Wish we could be sure how to bring him back . We can 't be sure , can we ? 30 seconds . Time 's up . Keep it pressed down . I AM keeping it pressed down . Well , it can 't be the right one . Then which one ? I don 't know . Try that one . - We got you back . - It works . I was so worried . - I had a few sweaty moments myself . - What was it like ? Not much really . It 's a bit like your property when Vila 's around . Suddenly it 's somewhere else . This would be worth a fortune to the Federation . It actually got you down there , onto the surface of Cygnus ? What do you think this is ? Moon dust ? Did you see anything while you were down there ? Not much . Now we know how it works , I 'll go back down and bring back anybody who wants to come . From the little I did see , they won 't take too much persuading . Wait . There 's a building . Cosy . What do you think it is ? The architectural style is Early Maniac . We need food and shelter . But do we need them that badly ? Listen , we ... Who are you ? I am the servant of your God . Kneel . Welcome , brothers . Come . Follow us God has prepared a place for you . Well ? I like God 's taste in servants . Shut up . I think we 've got it worked out now . Transmit and receive are quite straightforward . Everything else is directional . A little more practice , we should be able to put you down with precision . - Got everything ? - I 'm all set . How long do you want this time ? 4 hours should be enough . Testing . Any change and I 'll contact you on this . If something happens to you If we don 't hear or we can 't get you back ? You must decide for yourselves . But I wouldn 't want you to leave too soon . Oh , come on , Blake . Do you really think we 'd leave you down there ? No , we wouldn 't . No , I don 't think you would . Right , shall we get started ? All right . Ready ? Go . [ TELEPORTER WHINE ] His blessings are upon you . Speak and He will hear you . I am thy true servant . The souls from the outer darkness are amongst us ? They are in the place of the novices . A true bounty . Have they been touched by the Death ? The Curse of Cygnus is upon them all . Then let them know His mercy . You will teach them the first law : " Only from His hand comes life " " Only from His hand comes life " " And from His wrath comes death " " And from His wrath comes death " " We obey Him and give thanks for His mercy " " We obey Him and give thanks for His mercy " He is the giver of salvation . Salvation . His power drives out the ravening beast that is death . Death . It is He who must be obeyed . We thank you . Is there a maximum range on this ? Of course . I don 't know what it is though . What would happen if you teleported somebody beyond the maximum range ? They would appear momentarily in space , then their atoms would be scattered to the solar winds . Why don 't you go and do a little exploring ? I 'll keep an eye on things here . You wouldn 't be trying to get rid of me would you ? I have to get rid of Blake first . You 're next on my list . That would have been very disarming , if I didn 't know that you meant it . - Avon . - Yes ? Could you kill someone ? Face to face I mean . I don 't know . Could you ? There 's one sure way of finding out . The sickness will end soon . When it does , He will come to them . With other souls to do His work , there will be a chance for me . for the faithful to rise to the priesthood . He will not fail you . You will be rewarded . Have faith , Laran . Vila . Vila . Gan . Gan . Blake ? - What 's the matter with everybody ? - How did you get here ? - Never mind that now . What 's wrong ? - A disease in the atmosphere that all new arrivals get . - Can it be cured ? - The priests gave us a drug . They say we 'll be over it soon . - Why are they keeping you prisoners ? - We 're not prisoners . We 're just confined ' til we 're well again . Listen . No , the priests , they 've been very good to us , Blake . They 've given us food and drink . Treated us well . Listen , I 've got a ship . I can take you and the others off this planet . We can 't leave here . What are you talking about ? The sickness . We 're all infected . You said you 've had the drug . No , Blake . We have to be treated with the drug every day for the rest of our lives . If we leave , we die . Everybody ? Everybody . The priests call it the Curse of Cygnus , and no one is immune . Well then why haven 't I got it ? Ah , you will have . We all came down with it about 2 hours after we arrived . But I 've been here for nearly that long . Then it 's already in your system Blake , you can 't go back to your ship . I 'll talk with the leaders and get them to give us a supply of the drugs , or at least tell us how it 's made . In return I can offer some of them a chance to get off here . They might agree . It 's worth a try . Well , I 'll have to persuade them . You rest , now I 'll be back . Avon . What do you think ? I 'm glad to see you haven 't been wasting your time on frivolities . - What have you done ? - Just looking . - If we can 't get Blake back . - Where did you get the clothes ? I found a room full of them down there . Why don 't you go and have a look ? Perhaps I will . You can take over here , can 't you ? That is the recall button . - Avon . - Yes ? There 's another room you should see . At the far end . You might find it interesting . You are recovered ? Just about . An interesting design . A hand weapon of some kind . You will instruct me in its use . I 'm not too certain about it myself . Your possessions are forfeit . These are fascinating . Some sort of body adornment I thought at first . And then I wondered why a man would carry so many . Perhaps to use in trade , in barter . And then I thought again and that didn 't seem to be the answer either . They have no value in themselves . Ahhh . How did you get here ? I was a prisoner on the Federation ship . Untrue . The prisoners were observed from the moment they landed . All are accounted for . So when a new star was in our heavens , I understood .It is a spacecraft , isn 't it ? - Don 't destroy any more of those . - Answer me ! It is a spacecraft I was a prisoner on the Federation ship . With 2 others I escaped and we took control of a ship . It seems unlikely , but it has the ring of truth . I am the supreme power here . My followers obey without question . They worship me . - Or fear you . - The two are inseparable . Why you ? I am directly descended by the true and chosen line . Mine is the power by right . This planet was uninhabited until the Federation brought the first batch of 50 criminals here . Is that the noble line from which you stem ? My ancestors came here on that first shipment . They had nothing . No tools , no supplies . So they worked together . They worked hard and made a community . There were children born here . They were settlers trying to build a new world on a new planet . Later , more Federation prisoners came . There were disagreements . The community began to break up . They fought and killed . All that they had achieved was being destroyed . And it was my great great grandfather who found a way to unite them . He gave them a religion . Brought them together in the love and fear of God . That is the line I stem from . That is what gives me the right to rule . Forgive me for my ignorance I was wrong to question your authority . I apologise . You are wise . Unbelievers perish in His wrath . I came here only to find my friends . They have a disease . I understand you have a drug which will combat it . They will require it each day for the rest of their lives . I ask that they be allowed to choose whether they come with me . I ask that you give me a supply of that drug . No . I need those men I must have a crew . NO ! This society needs people . New blood , muscle and sinew to work the land . Human souls are the only currency . Our God is bankrupt without them . Will you trade them then ? There must be something on my ship that you need . Toys like this ? And these ? Is that what you offer me ? - What do you want ? - Power . - That you already have . Here , yes . But to take the Word beyond . To gather followers in new worlds , new disciples bound together and obeying the one true God . That is what I want . That is what you will give me . - How ? - Your ship You will give me your ship . No . I command it . You will contact your ship and order it to land . I can 't do that . You are mistaken . He has defied the Word . Teach him what happens to unbelievers . Teach him ! Is it a sign ? It tells us that the time is come to take our truth out into the universe . New worlds shall honour the power of the Word . - Lord Vargas . - Yes , Laran . The unbeliever will not submit . Kara , go to the place of novices . Speak to those who have newly come to us . Tell them what happens to those who disobey . You found it then ? Do you know how much is in there ? Millions Millions ! And this is just a sample . There must be as much wealth in that room as there is in the entire Federation banking system . Look at it ! You could buy a lot of freedom with this . You could buy anything with this . Think of it Jenna , there isn 't anything you couldn 't have . - But what about Blake ? - What about him ? No . - We could own our own planet . - We 're not leaving him there . We have to . He 's a crusader . He 'll view all this as just one more weapon to use against the Federation . And you know he can 't win . What do you want to be , rich or dead ? We might never have this opportunity again . If he 's not back in one hour then we 'll leave . Why ? Why wait ? Because that way I can convince myself that we gave him a fair chance . If he 's not back by then . All right . Give us a hand , will you ? Thank you What 's the matter with you ? Selman ? Arco ? Vila ? You 've got to give them what they want , Blake . Oh , really ? That madman wants the ship . Give him that and we 're finished . We 're finished already . They 're not going to give us the drug unless you do as they order . Without it we die . Tell him the rest . If you delay , one of us will be chosen for sacrifice . We 're not going to let that happen , Blake . If they can 't convince you then I will . You 're pathetic I should leave you to rot . You want to live like slaves ? Live or die at the whim of a madman ? Fine . But you 're not taking me down with you . I 'm getting out . I 'm better off without you . Even if we got away , we wouldn 't have the drug . - I know where it 's kept . - How long will it last ? That ship up there is the most advanced I 've ever seen . There are medicines on board , a laboratory . We can analyse the drug , make it ourselves . That 's what YOU say . Very soon now they 're going to come and take one of you away and there is nothing you can do to stop that happening , because there is no way I am going to order that ship to land . The choice is very simple . You can either fight or you can die . Well ? Well , I 'm with you . Anyone else ? Only from His hand comes life . And from His wrath comes death . We obey Him and give Him thanks for His blessing . It is time Bring the chosen one to the place of sacrifice . They 're coming . Ready ? It 's your last chance . All right ? Let 's get down . Oh , come on . There 's no point in waiting any longer . There 's still six minutes . We 've made our decision . Let 's just get out of here . Six minutes . We 'll wait . The novices made attack on us . We were able to overcome them . They will be punished . Come , prepare the sacrifice . Oh , Lord of our people , in offering up this sacrifice we crave Your blessing . Oh , Lord of our people , we dedicate this sacrifice to You . Now ! Get the bracelets . Get us up , Avon . Quick . Make it fast ! We lose it all . - Vila , where 's Selman ? - He 's dead . Gan . Don 't just stand there , Vila . Run ! Gan , come on . - Gan , can you hold them ? - As long as the door doesn 't break . - Did you see ? They killed Arco . - There 's no response from the ship . Perhaps these bracelets don 't work any more . And we can 't hold out much longer . That 's certain . And they 'll be getting reinforcements . Look , there 's only one way for it . You and Gan run . Hide among the rocks . At least in the dark you 've got a chance . I 'm going back in to get the gun . - They 'll kill you . - Gan , when I give the word , let go of the door . - Blake , we 'll all be killed ! - Gan , do as I tell you Now ! Come on . No . We 've got no choice . Get me up . Make it fast . Get the ship moving . Get over there . All of you . You 'll take this ship down to the surface . - We 're already moving away . - Then get it back . If you kill us , there 's no way you can run this ship . You 're getting further and further away from your precious drug . There is no drug ! The disease is a mild poison that clears itself . But for centuries the followers have believed in the disease , believed in the cure just as you have believed . So you and those before you built your power on fear and ruled them with it . I ruled a small prison planet with never more than 500 people . But with this I could rule a thousand planets . For that prize , do you think I would hesitate to kill you ? Now take this ship back to Cygnus Alpha . NOW ! I was their priest . I shall return to them A GOD ! Information Sensors register that Liberator has been scanned by detector beams . A fleet of ships is approaching and has changed course toward this system . Put them on the screen . There they are . Identify . Available data classifies them as Federation pursuit ships . Set a course to take us away from them . Maximum speed . Course and speed confirmed . With our speed we 'll probably outrun them . This time . But they 'll keep coming . Pushing us , tracking us . They 'll never give up . Nor will we . When we can handle this ship properly , we 'll stop running . Then we 'll fight .

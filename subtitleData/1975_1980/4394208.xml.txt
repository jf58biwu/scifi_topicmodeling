 Don 't go , Steel . - What is it ? - Listen . You told me . You forgot . - That was a gunshot , sir ! - Yes , it was ! From inside the dining room . Nobody takes guns into dining rooms . - Emma , stop your prattling . - It might be Tony . Where are Howard and Felix ? Felix went upstairs to get some cigarettes . I thought Howard was in the library . - No , he isn 't . - Well , let 's get in there ! Tony ? ! And then there were eight . - Suicide . - It 's out of his reach . - He killed her and shot himself . - There 's no reason for this ! There 's a reason for all of it . The time change , the murders , - the barrier around this house . - It 's just hard to pinpoint . If you don 't pinpoint it quickly there won 't be any of us left ! 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' - Nobody else , I can 't bear it ! - Take the ladies outside . Good idea . Come on , let 's go . - Excuse me , Miss Emma . - I must get Greville to tidy up . Purnell was in love with Ann Shaw , Mullrine 's secretary . Not in love - he was using her . - There 's a difference ? - On this planet , yes . Veronica was in the way . Is that strong enough motive for murder ? It all depends what he was using her for . Access to Mullrine 's office records . His plans for the future . McDee 's notes from 50 years ago . Are any of those sufficient motive ? Who has the motive to kill Purnell ? Purnell is Mullrine 's banker . Maybe it 's something to do with the bank . Could the bank be in trouble ? The motives are irrelevant , they 're merely part of the time change . - " Merely , " for more than murders ? - The clues are here , we have them . We have ? - Remember when I first met Veronica ? - What about it ? I received information about her background but not that she was going to die . Well , either you made a mistake ... or she isn 't dead . - And assuming that ... - Neither is Tony Purnell . Tony Purnell and Veronica Blamey , I wonder what the link is . They came here together , they 're the two youngest ... No , I mean the link between them and ... Killing them off one by one , starting with the youngest . - Steel ... - What is it ? - It 's getting closer . - Yes , but where ? It 's very close . You realise it 's fooling us , don 't you ? Drawing us further and further away from the truth . It 's setting us puzzles about these murders that it knows we 're innately bound to solve . So are we ... Miles and Virginia . What are you talking about ? It has to deal with us on more than one level , as Sapphire and Steel and as Miles and Virginia . And as long as it has to deal with them ... We stand a chance of winning . I wonder where the next puzzle is coming from . Look ! The molecular structure is altering . It 's going back 50 years . - It 's ageing . - Yes , it 's going backwards . Steel , things age forwards . From 1930 to 1980 . Look at the dust , the cobwebs . This is as it would have been if it had lain here for 50 years . " McD . " But look at it . There 's not a mark on it , no oxidisation , no dust , nothing ! It 's in a different time frame . Steel ... that gun is going to be used again . But where are we , Sapphire ? Get us back . Now ! - God , this is ridiculous ! - Howard , you look dreadful . - Where have you been ? - Trying to get out . Impossible ! Like an impenetrable barrier . The servants have left . See , Arthur , you can 't depend on servants at all these days . Greville is still here , we can always depend on him . - Greville is special . - That 's better . - Darling , have I missed anything ? - Yes , you have ! Purnell is dead . - Good grief . - Where have you been ? It 's slightly embarrassing in mixed company . Too much champagne - had to pump ship . - Took you long enough . - How did Purnell die ? - Shot . Through the heart . - Through the heart ? ! Howard , do you own a revolver ? - Yes , I do . My father gave it to me . - And where is that revolver now ? - In my suitcase . - No , I 'm afraid it isn 't . Are you accusing Howard , Mr Cavendish ? I recognise that - that 's yours , Howard ! It was in the next room , by the body . Still warm when I picked it up . I haven 't been anywhere near the dining room ! Well , I assume it was in the dining room . I will not have Howard intimidated this way . How do you intimidate a blackmailer ? - Blackmailer ? - Your precious Howard . - He 'd been blackmailing Purnell . - Why should Howard do that ? Tony was filching money from the bank . - It 's a lie . - I 'm afraid it 's true , Felicity . Tony got away a few days ago . His father was going to make good all the money he embezzled . On one condition - that Tony went to the police . But you had to stop Tony doing that , didn 't you , Howard ? I haven 't killed anybody . This is a monstrous suggestion ! Oh , this is absurd . I 'm going to see for myself . This gets crazier by the minute ! Howard is right , there is no body . No evidence ... - But you said you saw ... - I saw two murders , Felix . Two bodies . The Blamey girl and young Purnell . Yes , that is what you saw , but I don 't think Purnell was responsible for the knife in Veronica 's back . Nor do I think Howard shot Tony Purnell . - Thank you . - Somebody else is the killer ? Someone else is responsible , yes . And they haven 't finished . # If one green bottle should accidentally fall # No , that 's the wrong tune . Listen . - # If one green bottle ... # - That 's right ! # There 'll be seven green bottles hanging on the wall # Seven green bottles hanging on the wall # Seven green bottles hanging on the wall # And if one green bottle should accidentally fall ... # - You only touched the barrel ? - Of course . # Six green bottles hanging on the wall # Six green bottles hanging on the wall # And if one green bottle should accidentally fall # They are real . Both of them ? Yes . The knife has been used hundreds of time by many people . It was made in Sheffield in 1924 and brought into this house by Greville . Who used it on Veronica Blamey ? No living soul . And the revolver ? Who used it on Purnell ? No living soul . In this house , Sapphire . Something hidden . Something disguised . A force inhabiting something . Yes , well , tell me some more about that . It was made in Birmingham in 1928 and brought into this house by George McDee . Who used it on Purnell ? No living soul . That doesn 't tell us much . It 's so eerie , dreadful things keep happening . - Do you know what I think ? - No one cares , Emma . I think it 's a poltergeist . It 's a little poltergeist trying to tell us something . I 'm not sorry about this . - Who do you suppose killed Purnell ? - If anybody did . What are you talking about ? We all saw the body . - But can you see it now ? - You stand up for yourself . Till they put a rope round your neck . Felix , there 's no time for any more games . Not even hangman before dinner . Oh , do keep quiet , you silly old sausage . Don 't be rude , Arthur , not even to Emma ! Really , Arthur . Did you learn anything ? A need to kill in this house . And we are its only obstacle . It 's having to concentrate on us . The power resides in this house . Everything else is irrelevant to the central intention . Which is ? The need to retrace the years back to 1930 . Until time takes a different course . Felix , it 's been in the family for years . Still , it was your gun and you did have a motive . - Yes . - I don 't think Miles would agree . What does he know ? And who the hell is he , anyway ? Mind your language , Howard ! - In front of the ladies . - Of course . So sorry . - Think nothing of it . - I wasn 't talking to you . - There we are , Grandmama . - Thank you , Malcolm . I wish somebody could tell me what is going on . I 'll second that . Howard has a point . - Here we are , all friends ... - Ha ha At least we all know a great deal about each other . Except for the Cavendishes . They 're my guests ! That should be good enough . All you can tell us about him is that he is in futures . - Where did you meet him , Arthur ? - At my club . He introduced himself and we got talking business . And now you 're happy to let him investigate two apparent murders ? - Yes . - Why ? Because he 's qualified ! 'You were right . ' 'What ? ' 'The motives are irrelevant . 'What do you mean by a different course ? ' 'An uncontrollable disaster in 1930 . ' 'And no one knew ? ' 'It was frustrated on June 22nd , 50 years ago . ' 'So now it 's gonna take us back to that day 'and rearrange events that followed ? - ' For that ... ' - ' It needs George McDee . 'It can 't let him die . If it can keep him alive he will cause the disaster . 'Life will end on this planet . ' 'And does it need any of the other people in this house ? 'Felix and Annabelle Harborough , Howard McDee , Emma , the others ? ' 'They 're living in a void , in a vacuum . ' 'Have any of them been taken over ? Ah , so this is where you two lovely people are hiding ! Well , we weren 't exactly hiding . Well , you 'll have to stop , we 've decided to eat at last . - Miles ! - We 've put it off long enough . Greville 's getting exasperated and if Cook goes into a sulk the pudding will be a disaster . Ah , Cavendish . We 're led to believe you 're a qualified detective . - In a way , yes . - What do you mean ? - I 'm a specialised investigator . - In futures . He works out who 's going to commit the crime before it happens , eh ? Well , you did say you were in the futures market . How fascinating . Well ? - ' Can you guess who 'll be next ? ' - Since you ask ... yes , I can . That 's why you haven 't asked us what we were doing at the time of the murders . You could tell us what we 'll be doing at the time of the next murder I wouldn 't take the next few hours too lightly . Dinner is served , sir ! Splendid ! Come along everybody ! Who 's going to take in who ? We 've got a rather special jugged hare tonight . - Arthur shot it himself . - Arthur 's a dab hand with a gun . It 's not the shooting of the hare it 's the excitement of waiting . I don 't mind trying to eat the poor creature but I will not ... I love my brother but he 's too fond of shooting things . Ooh ! Oh , this is too wretched . I shan 't be able to eat a thing . Cook will be so disappointed . Do try , Felicity . Won 't you sit down , everybody ? 'Sapphire ... ' 'The rule is to start from the outside and work your way through . ' Sorry , Miss Emma , I 'm not very hungry either . Oh , what a shame ! I do like to see good appetites around me . In spite of what happened to take them away ? Oh , yes . We must eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow ... Oh , what am I saying ? It 's awful but I feel ravenous ! Annabelle ! How can you be so callous ? - I can 't help it . - Annabelle 's appetites need crisis . Rather like my thirst ! 'George ? George , darling ? ' 'Hello ... Oh , Emma ! ' 'Hello , I hope you don 't mind . I had to see you . ' George ? George , darling ? Hello ... Oh , Emma ! Hello . I hope you don 't mind . I had to see you . This is idiotic , Emma ! Have you told her ? Not yet . Turn that thing down , will you ? ! I ... I 've been too busy here . - You promised you 'd tell her . - And I will . - When ? - Very soon , I promise . Now be a good girl and get out of here before anybody notices . If they do notice ! I only came to say we 're just starting dinner . Aye , well , you be a good girl and get along without me . - I 'll be along in a minute . - Yes . George ? Yes ? Shall I see you tonight ? Yes , of course . Come to my room when she 's in bed and asleep . When they 're all asleep . I 'll be waiting . And this chap , who 'd had a couple of drinks , said to Emma , " Do you know the road to Mandalay ? " And she said , " Yes , shall I sing it ? " And he said , " No , take it ! " I thought that was funny . - There you are ! - We were talking about you . I 've been making sure everything 's all right in the kitchen . Somebody had to help Cook . I see no one had the courtesy to wait for me . You know you don 't like being disturbed . Greville , you 've kept something from Mr McDee . Yes ! There 's a draught in that drawing room . Yes , it chilled me to the bone . - It 's always been there . - It 's no warmer in here . - It 's midsummer . - The night of the summer solstice . - Tell us all about it . - It 's the points on the elliptic ... - Miles , you can tell me . - Well , it ... It 's the points that mark the earth 's position at the sun 's extreme limit of distance ... - north and south of the equator . - Fascinating . All double Dutch to me . It 's the longest day . We have little control over our fates on June 21st . - Oh , dear . - Rubbish ! A sensible man can control his fate . Do you think so ? 'They 're accepting his presence . ' - ' Howard isn 't . ' - Shall I serve now , sir , - or when the ladies have retired ? - I have no intention of retiring . - Safety in numbers , eh ? - Quite right ! - Oh , not while the men are smoking . - No , we 're going to stick together . Serve the port , Greville , get it over with . - Yes , sir . For you ? - No , no . Start at the other end . Yes , sir . Mr Cavendish ! Sir . Come along , man , it 's with you . Yes . You not drinking , Cavendish ? If you 're not , would you mind passing it ? Oh , sorry . - Good God , man , clockwise ! - Shut up , Howard ! 'Sapphire ? What is going on ? ' 'It 's the custom here to pass this particular drink to the left . ' 'Why ? ' 'Just one of their childish superstitions . ' May I , er ... May I offer you the first toast of the evening ? - No speeches ! - Mullrine and McDee . To the millions they make out of pain and misery . To our hosts - charlatans and purveyors of blood . - Howard , you are a pest . - Who are you ? ! I 'm ... I 'm ... Do you think he 's drunk , Arthur ? A bit squiffy ? On the contrary , he 's a bit dead .

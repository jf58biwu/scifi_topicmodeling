Just to waste resources . On and on , just for show . No - I agree with every word you said . - How many died ? - Twenty-seven . God ! They 've no idea ? None they 're admitting to . So until they do , and stop yelling " sabotage " and looking for scapegoats ... this gentleman is our guest ? He 's my double . You wouldn 't believe it but he is . In essentials . I think , just possibly , we can help . We found something . It 's not much , but ... Frank . It was somewhere between the two dishes . An anomaly ? I don 't think so . Anomalies usually make me itch . And I didn 't itch . We had one of them lined up on your show . - Dog Dish . - That 's right . Oh , we call them " Dog Dish " and " Cat Dish " .

Well , afterwards in the , er , routine checks ... it was you , Alison , that spotted it . The trace ? Yes . Ah , yes . - Your heavy disturbance . - You boosted it ? No . It was that strong . Look - what are you getting at , Tommy ? Well , the point is ... that Cat Dish , that 's the other one ... facing in a totally different direction , picked it up too . Identical . It 's nasty , Joe . A thing like this , I don 't itch . I wheeze . Fault ? In both the plotters ? Well , in the receivers ? It must be . They 're all over-age . Frank , I 've got five new modules - well , not new .

And I thought ... somebody else was drinking from this pot ... out of this pot ... five thousand years ago . And it ... well , it was as if they were standing next to me .

Sarah ? Why don 't you take Debbie in ? Look , go and feed Nannie . Nannie 's feeding herself , though . Well , pick something she can 't reach . Give her a treat . Go on . I drove past there , just now . And it 's all ... blasted . You wouldn 't believe it , but the stones are broken . And there 's a sort of ... debris I 've never seen before . Have you any idea ?

Or perhaps ... There was one survivor . We brought her with us . Hello , Annie . Oh , my dear ! Oh , dear , oh ... ! You 'd better come and see her . [ PANTING ] You can 't treat that ! I can . I 'm willing her . Oh , God - let me think . There 's no hospital within fifty miles of here that makes any sense . So many closed down . I think it 's the whole nervous system . Shh !

Eh , somebody to meet you . - Professor , um ... - Quatermass . Oh . Very nice . Mr Chisholm ? I understand that ... you too were a scientist ? Oh , yes . For many years . - I worked in research . - Research , eh ? What area ? I was with Greeley and Presser . Er ... I don 't think I ... They made the best soap in the world . Soap . [ MEDICAL MONITORS BEEPING ] Doctor ! Look , can you PLEASE authorise some top-level immediate examination . There may not be much time . This may be the only chance we have to find out how this dreadful ... What ? What others ? How many have there been ? Where ? What 's happening ? [ EXPLOSION ] [ ECHOING ] Sarah ! Oh . Debbie !

Oh , he 's in with old Chisholm . He 's in there all the time . At my peak ... I could differentiate one thousand , five hundred and thirty two separate odours . Ha , ha ! To achieve that ... took a lot of training . What you were saying just now about ... musk ? Aaah , musk . It is THE great perfume . About making it ? We never used synthetics at Greeleys ! No , no , no - I mean obtaining it . Always from the male musk deer . A dried secretion . The finest came from Tibet . In boxes covered in silk . - So precious . - The deer ? Were they always killed ? Well , of course . Do you know , the hunters lured them with the sound of flutes . Or trapped them in nets of green hemp - which they couldn 't see . [ LAUGHING ] How much of the animal was used ? Oh , a trace - a mere trace . You are talking about a fragrance . Our Mr Greeley 's father ... had actually been to the East , in his youth .

How many of these strikes ... were on crowds gathered near megaliths ? Stone circles ? Yes . I 'd say a-about a third . And these circles date back , what ? Four or five thousand years ? That your " when " ? Significant . Oh , just one thing . You 're saying ... those stones weren 't put there by human hands ? Oh , yes , they were . - Well then ... - No doubt about it . - Well then , what ... - I think ... that men may have ... raised those megaliths to ... commemorate - to mark - places that had become ... terrible to them . Places that had been ... visited . You reckon it came then ? And left traces behind . Perhaps ... deep under the surface . In our terms ... guidance beacons set in the earth - for next time . And this is " next time " . [ WHISPERING AND MUTTERING ] Ssh ! Quiet please ! Now for the " what " . Try this . A colossal ... invisible skin . A skin ? Yes , just to get ... some kind of an image .

And do ... well , what ... what we know it does . Well , you 've gotten ahead of us in some respects . But , uh ... any guesses as to why ? It 's , um ... it-its purpose ? Yes . We 're obviously facing an intelligence of ... some order . It seems to us that the primary need is to ... What is it ? Okay . Okay , let him take it , then . Bernard ? We 've got this Moscow link , now . Somebody you know . Academician Pavel Grigoritch Gurov . Oh , yeah . Yes . Yes , I know him . Quatermass ! This is a tragedy ! It is a cosmic error ! An error ? A ... terrible misunderstanding . Well , what do you mean ? All my life I have dreaded it . That some advanced form of society should appear ... and fail to communicate . Now it happens . Here ! In Volgograd Province , in Kursk , Uzbekistan ! Today ... a mass gathering of the Pioneers . The Young Communist League . Children ! [ SOBBING ] Oh , God . When they came before , they found savages . You see - I agree with you , Quatermass . In the Bronze Age . Da . But now it comes again and it mistakes . We are advanced society . It might not think so . Planned society . Marxist-Leninist , is ours ! Da . And even you in the West . We must reach it ! We must communicate ! Communicate ? With-with-with that ? Well , in Soviet Union we have much-prepared method ... code and radio emissions ... teknika of govorit ! Oh , talk to it - we can ! Gurov 's out of his mind . We 're gonna try it . You are ? ! Now , Chuck ... We 've got a shuttle rocket on the pad , right now . The Russkies came on through with a lot of stuff . We 're gonna use it . Now , wait a minute . Now , wait a minute ! Bernard . I want your evaluations . I want them quick . We 're into countdown . Well , go on ! Help him , if he 's trying to save us ! - Keep out of it , John . - Well , he must - he must ! My evaluation , Chuck ? Here it is . Forget about trying to get through to it . - But surely we have to try to ... - The ripe crop ... can 't appeal to the reaper ! What does he mean ? What is it ' ? I think ... this is the gathering time . The human race ... is being harvested ! [ SCREAMING ] Mrs Morgan ? As District Commissioner ... I see a lot of these ... megalith sites are in your area . Yes , sir . Can they be effectively sealed off ? If we had more army units . More ? ! It 's the only hope . The Pay Cops are useless , you know that . And there are far too many sites . - How many ? - Hundreds ! Let me see those . At least they 're highly recognisable . These gigantic stones . Not always . As I tried to explain , sir . The real signal ... is probably far beneath . These stones were put there by our ancestors , I-in an attempt to ... appease something . - What about Silchester ? - Oh , Silchester . No megaliths there ! - Look here , isn 't it time ? - About five minutes , sir . Professor ? What about Silchester ? I think there would have been stones there once . It was one of the great node points . The junction of every road and track in the area . The Romans built their city on it . And the stones ? Well , perhaps they 've been ... shifted or broken . But what was underneath ... stayed . Under the open fields . And yesterday , those kids found it . Please ! Please ! Three thousand more of them ! A meadow . Appropriate , for a human harvest . That is really what you believe is happening ? I have to . So these are no help , then ? The dangerous places could be anywhere . Perhaps . Traditional gathering sites . Then even here - in London ? The great parks . Tyburn , Eastcheap . Or right here . Two hundred feet above our head . Maiden Castle . - Blackhills . - Runnymeade . NO ! Professor Quatermass , this " harvest " theory of yours . I don 't like it . I don 't buy it ! But surely , this terrible event ... " Terrible " , " terrifying " - those are his words . For countless thousands of deaths . " Deaths " ? What do you mean , David ? I believe that we 're in the presence of something that ... he doesn 't begin to understand . And you do ? Something ... momentous , I agree .

But , Professor ... a machine must have a maker ? Of course . But the intelligence that made this ... is quite beyond our reach ... and our understanding .

That 's all . Give it a zetz , eh ? Somewhere ... on the other side of the universe . [ CAR BEEPING ] Cup of tea ? Da . If only it functions as it should . Perhaps that 's the hold-up ? Mmm . This focus mechanism . Very ingenious . But our people have certain criticisms . Where the hell is it ? Quatermass - this is not for you to do ! You can trust me . But I-I did not intend to ... I 'll manage . Besides ... I 've got some help . [ HELICOPTER ENGINE , MOVING CLOSER ] Bernard ? Look ! Thirty-five kilotons of thermonuclear blast ... focussed upwards .

Yes it was . We were always going to go to the seaside . Some day - when things got better , we said . I can make them exist , do you know that ? Oh , not by magic or faith ... by thinking . I can carry Debbie down to the water 's edge ... where she never went . She dips her toes in . It 's not so cold - not too cold . And she 's pleased . Because she 's been afraid of it and now she isn 't . And she sees the little bits of weed drifting about ... the colours and the shine . Then Clare comes with Sarah by the hand - walking in the waves . I can touch them . Oh , I know what evil is . That 's evil . Perhaps " evil " is ... always something else 's " good " ? Perhaps it 's a cosmic law ? Satan ? The Enemy . [ ELECTRONIC ALARM ] Suppose it can 't ? Like lightning not striking twice . This lightning 's programmed . If only I 've guessed the program .

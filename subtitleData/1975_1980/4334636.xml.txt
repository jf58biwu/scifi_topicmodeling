 [ Panting , Sighing ] You know , before I met you two , I lived in a comfortable house . I-I ate excellent food , every day . I was living the good life , and now look at me . - You 're very hard to please . - [ Chuckles ] You don 't like being on the run with a fair chance of being killed by Urko ? Well , I would like a couple of minutes to think that over before I answer . What about all the excitement and stimulation we provide , the fun things you 've learned ? I have learned ... that life is made up of a series of hills ... that I get to climb up so that I can climb down . Well , I know exactly a way to find out what 's on the other side of that hill . Marvelous the way you figure these things out , you know . Mmm . Here we go . It can 't be . Whoo ! [ Pete Chuckling ] I 'd forgotten what a city looks like . [ Yapping ] This is downtown nowhere . Hello there . What do you call this ... city ? Hey , look , we 're friends . We just wanna talk to you . Are there any apes here ? - There goes the welcoming committee . - Hold it ! Listen ! [ Hoofbeats Approaching ] Oh ! - Okay to get my heart started again ? - Mmm . - We better find a place to hole up . - Another day , another hole . What about this place ? I wonder what it was . Must be important , by the looks of it . - So was the Colosseum . - What 's a Colosseum ? It was an arena where humans were forced to fight animals . The animals usually won . " Oakland ... Science Institute . " - That was a government think tank . - This- - Oakland ? Well , it was . Come on . Let 's take a look . Interesting decor- - done in Early American disaster . Hmm ? [ Alan ] This looks like it could be something interesting . Let 's take a look . - [ Air Hissing ] - Vacuum-sealed . Mm . Oh ! Now , what is that ? Beats me . Did you ever see anything like that , Pete ? - Uh-uh . - Someone sure wanted it to last for a long time . [ Sighs ] Wanna push some buttons ? I don 't understand . [ Electronic Clicking ] [ Gasps ] In the years to come , whoever finds our institute , we , the scientists , greet you . The destruction of our world ... as we know it is imminent . But our civilization 's great advances ... must not vanish . We have , therefore , deposited the sum of all our scientific knowledge ... in a number of vaults which are located ... in various cities throughout the world ... and which , we hope , will be found by future generations . In this city , the vault is embedded in concrete ... [ Recording Slows ] on the lower level of the- - [ Recording Fades , Stops ] [ Electronic Pulsing ] - [ Pulsing Stops ] - Power ! Could be . This baby 's been around for a long , long time . - Is it magic ? - No , Galen , it 's technology-based , - way ahead of our time . - [ Whimpers ] - Ah . Here , try this . - Yeah , good . - Hmm . - What do you think ? There 's probably zinc in the power unit . We should be able to find some copper plumbing pipe , then all we need is a container and sulfuric acid to re-up a battery and get this going . Does it matter ? It could give us all the answers we 've been looking for . - [ Sighs ] - Let 's go get that copper . - Insulation . This should do it . - Do what ? We burn this , collect the fumes- - we 've got sulfur dioxide . You blend it at the right temperature with water and oxygen , you make sulfuric acid . - Hmm ! - Then we melt down the copper we found , form a base conductor , and we 've got a battery , maybe . Hmm . [ Whispering ] Soldiers ! Those two- - they 're not like the other humans in the city- - too well-fed- - and an ape . When I give the signal , we separate and run for it . Meet back at the institute . Anybody not there within 2 4 hours , we figure they 've had it . Just get that projector rolling and find the film , top priority . It 's more important than any one of us . Okay , now , take off ! [ Groaning ] No . No , no ! Don 't be frightened . I won 't hurt you . - You have to go ! No ! - I can 't . Captain ! I can tell you somethin you 'd like to know . - Yes ? - It 's worth a lot . - How much ? - Two days ' food . One day ? Talk . [ Gasps ] Come on ! Take him ! Sit and wait ! No , no , no . There 's got to be something more we can do . Galen , when you joined this outfit , you got stuck obeying orders ... - from the commanding officer , Colonel Alan Virdon . - I do not take orders ! - Then what are you doing here ? - I accept suggestions . Okay , Alan " suggested " we sit tight and wait for 2 4 hours . It 's liable to be a long , cold night . [ Whinnying ] Well , Virdon . It 's good to see you again . You should be flattered . We rushed here the minute we heard you were captured . Now , let 's not waste time . Where is the renegade ape and your friend , Burke ? - [ Groans ] - Well , help him up ! [ Laughs ] - Where are they ? - I don 't know . Where are they ? [ Shouting ] Where are they ? - Like a needle in a haystack . - Hmm ? It 's an old expression . Hey , wait a minute . Wait a minute ! I 'm tryin ' to find somebody ! In a haystack . [ Urko ] Why don 't you eat ? I was starving . Are you planning to beat the prisoner again ? - If necessary . - You 'll kill him . If necessary . That 's too bad . - You mourn for a human ? - No ! I mourn for Urko , and the strong influence you were becoming in the High Council . I 'm not worried . My influence will continue to grow . By killing humans ? We 're not concerned merely with the death of this prisoner . We must make certain ... his dangerous ideas do not infect domesticated humans . To this end , I believe that we- - I will make certain ideas die with the man . Eliminating him is useless ... if his companions are free to spread the poison . Urko , your prisoner alive ... is the surest method of capturing the other two . I see . The wise Zaius has his own plans ... for getting information from the prisoner . I have been thinking about it . Stop fighting . You 're in luck . You 're gonna earn more food than you 've ever seen . - What do I have to do ? - Ask somebody the right questions ... and tell us the answers . Is that all ? She was Tomar 's woman . He was a rebel . When you capture a rebel , it 's probably better to kill his whole family . Those around him are usually infected . - Please ... I didn 't mean- - - Quiet ! It 's just as well you didn 't kill her . She will serve a better purpose . What are you gonna do with me ? Come along . [ Footsteps Recede ] Ow ! [ Moaning ] [ Door Closes ] [ Groans ] - Are you all right ? - Yes . - Are you sure ? - Mmm . I 'm glad of that . Who are you ? What 's going on ? Why 'd they put us in here ? [ Gasping ] [ Groaning ] - Where 's Virdon ? - [ Grunting ] - A man- - he was captured yesterday . - Yes , he was brought in . Uh-huh . To that building ? - Which room ? Which floor ? - He 's not there . The truth- - he was taken away this morning . - [ Gagging ] I don 't know where . - You 're lying ! Well , there 's no one else here but us . You have no idea what it 's all about ? What about you , son ? You know why they put you in here ? I was caught stealing food . A human can be killed for stealing food . Urko doesn 't need an excuse to kill me . - Wonder why he didn 't do it . - What is this place ? This was kinda famous in my time . It was built with oil money ... by someone who wanted to live like a 1 6th-century baron . I-I don 't understand . What do you mean , in your time ? - Where are you going ? - When Urko has a chance to kill me ... and doesn 't do it , I want to find out why . They could have killed you ! Yeah , they could have , but they didn 't . Deliberately- - it was an easy shot . They want me in here alive . Now , why was that gorilla hiding in the- - Of course , it 's gotta be- - It 's a trap . They 're using me as the bait . - A trap ? - Yeah , for my friends . But it won 't work . Urko 's traps aren 't gonna catch anybody . Why ? I heard shots . Are you all right ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm okay . - He tried to escape . Yeah , but I 'm not gonna try that for a while . I think- - I think I 'll wait about 2 4 hours , then we 'll all find a way out . Has been such a very long time . I think Alan is not coming back . - Galen , I 'm makin ' a battery . - Batteries ? I don 't care about batteries ... or all that knowledge that you fellows keep talking about . I just care what happens to Alan ! I know . You got company . I wonder how they do this . - [ Urko ] Huh ? - I wonder how they do this . Hmm ? This thing that Virdon carried with him- - I wonder how it was made . Why do you waste your time on that stupid picture ? He tried to escape ! But he didn 't succeed . This will be the key to our problem . You 'll see . I 'm sorry I let you talk me into it . I 've studied the humans . They 're extremely vulnerable in family situations . It 's only a matter of time ... until he 'll come to think of that woman- - and the boy- - as his own family . He 'll lower his defenses with them , then he 'll tell that boy things ... all your torture could never drag out of him . - My name 's Virdon- - Alan Virdon . - I 'm Kraik . Kraik . It 's a good name , Kraik . Pleased to meet ya . Now , you see , in my time , when two men met and wanted to be friends , that 's what they did- - they shook hands . - Why ? - Well , I 'm not really sure . You see , customs have a way of starting a long time ago ... and hanging on even when the reasons are forgotten . But , uh , I think maybe it started a long , long time ago . When two new friends met , they grabbed each other 's right hands so they couldn 't strike each other with their weapons . It 's a very good idea ... if the friend hasn 't got a knife in his left hand . [ Chuckling ] You really hit all the bases , don 't ya ? - I don 't know what that means . - Yeah , it doesn 't matter . Do you have any parents , Kraik ? I wonder why they put you in here with me . You 're no threat to Urko . I don 't know , but I 'm glad I 'm with you . How much longer ? I have to make sulfuric acid , find out if it will start that projector . [ Groans ] Then what ? Then we find out where that hidden vault is and go there . [ Sighs ] What then ? We stash all that knowledge someplace safe . And after that ? And then we come back here , and we find Virdon . Mmm ! That 's what I wanted to hear ! - Look ! Look what I found ! - What ? No , no , Kraik . No , no . Now- - Kraik , now , take it easy now . Come on . That 's not gonna solve anything . If you eat all the food now , what about tomorrow ? - I 'm hungry now . I don 't care about tomorrow . - But you will ... tomorrow . What do you say we let Arn divide up the food equally ... so there 'll be enough for today and for tomorrow , huh ? Start of daylight , I want all the soldiers you can spare . - Yes , sir . - That 's all . Commanding a war party ? A search party , Zaius . A search party ... for the chimpanzee Galen and Burke . You do it your way , I 'll do it mine- - section by section , building by building . It 's very good , Arn . I 'm glad you like it . I want more . Something doesn 't taste good ? Oh , no . No , no . I was just thinking about my friends . These friends of yours- - where are they ? - You 're better off if I don 't tell you . - But I 'd like to know . Kraik , if the gorillas thought that you knew , they 'd tear you apart to get the information . - I don 't care . Can 't you just tell me- - - Kraik . He 's trying to protect us . Can 't you see that ? He 's protecting us . You 're a very good man , Alan ... like Tomar was . And you 're a good woman , Arn , like- - You 're a good woman . Don 't touch that . It 's sulfuric acid . Burn a hole in your hand . Ooh . Are you ready to put it together with the copper and see if it 'll work ? [ Yawns ] Uh , in the mornin ' , hmm ? I 'm bushed . Uh-uh-uh . You are delaying . It 's been over 2 4 hours . Maybe he 'll be here in the morning . - Mmm . - [ Sighs ] - What are you makin ' ? - An airplane . Oh , uh- - it 's a flying machine . Vroom ! Zoom ! [ Imitates Engine ] - " Flying machine " ? - Sure . - W-Will it fly ? - Maybe . - Can I have one ? - Maybe . Did you ever fly , really ? Oh , sure . Many times . There was a time when people used to fly everywhere . And did they always have enough to eat ? - No , not always . Not everybody . - Like here , now . No , actually , people in that time didn 't have it as tough as you do now . I don 't eat bad . If anybody can find food , it 's me . I know this city like nobody else does . If I hear somebody 's got fruit , maybe sometimes meat , I sneak in the back way , or come up through a sewer , or crawl in a hidden window . I grab and run before anybody 's even looking ! Yeah . Well , if we can get our hands on what 's buried in this city , you nor anyone else will have to scratch or steal for food . - Is food buried ? - No , but a lot of long-forgotten ideas ... that could help make this a nicer world . A million things you never even dreamed of . Could I have my own ... flying machine ? Maybe . He respects you , I think . My son would be about his age . I 'm sure he 's never trusted anyone before . Go ! It works ! It works . We haven 't got much time . Gorillas are going in every building . - They 're moving in this direction . - Battery 's ready to be hooked up . There we go . There . Now , all we have to do is whomp up a strap to hold it to your side , and you 've got something to carry your things in . - What things ? - Oh . Yeah , that 's right . You don 't have a baseball or bubble gum ... or even a crumbled-up chocolate cookie . You see , where I came from , boys loved to have pockets like that pouch ... so you could carry your things in it . This place you come from- - will you go back ? I hope so , someday . I think I 'd like to see it . I think I 'd like to see you start pulling your weight around here . - What ? - That means do your share of the work . How ' bout going down below and collecting us some firewood , huh ? [ Yawning ] In a little while . That story you told Kraik about ... what the world could be like , - was it true ? - It was a hope . Oh . Only a hope . But it 's not impossible . See , my friends and I found a place here with a message , and it told about a hope for the world , for humans , in the form of human knowledge . How do you find this knowledge ? You know that building that 's not far from where you lived- - the one with the big columns in the front ... - and the arched entrance way ? - I 've been there . There 's nothing inside- - no food , no clothes , nothing . Wrong . There 's a machine in there , Kraik , and by now it might have already told my friends where to find that knowledge . A machine that talks . You 're makin 'fun of me ! Oh , yeah ? Well , if you don 't get to work right away , I 'm gonna really make fun of you . - I wanna hear more stories . - Ah , later . Do your job first . - But- - - Aah ! Right now ! [ Sighs ] I like to hear stories about your world too . Compared to where you were living , I 'm sure that almost any place must sound wonderful . When I first met Tomar , he lived on a farm with his brother . It was beautiful . Couldn 't you go back to the farm ? I 've thought about it , but it 's easier to do nothing . But when you 're alone , maybe it 's better ... not to go where you 're always reminded that once you were- - you weren 't alone . You couldn 't meet another man ? Yes . I didn 't think so ... but I do now . I 'll be right back . Kraik ? [ Sighs ] Why did you take it ? I didn 't take anything . We 're gonna lay down a few ground rules on how to behave--you and me and Arn- - and the first thing is , we trust each other , okay ? - Maybe . - And we don 't lie , and we don 't take things without permission . I 'm tired . I wanna sleep . - Let me have the model , please . - I won 't ! Now , you 're not to take anything unless you have permission . Kraik . All right , let me have the airplane . There 's your stupid airplane ! I don 't want it ! I hate you ! I hate you ! He wants to see you . He says you promised him a reward . Well , tell me . Don 't waste my time ! Do you know where the outlaw ape and the human are ? He was very upset . Kraik . He made the airplane just for you . I told a gorilla . [ Sobbing ] You , see that no one gets out the back . You go with him . - Yes , sir . - Post two guards on each side of the door . Hey , come on , Kraik . No , I don 't hate you . - I 'm sorry . - What will happen to your friends ? Oh , they 've long since left that building . Would they take the talking machine with them ? No . But if my friends were able to get it to work , it could tell me where they are . But it doesn 't matter , you can 't go to them . But the apes might find that message . I 've gotta get outta here . - [ Kraik ] I know a way out . - Why didn 't you tell me that ? I liked it here . I had enough to eat , and the gorillas said they 'd give me more if I helped . All right , Kraik . I can 't promise you any food , but I could use your help . - Did you get it ? - Get what ? - The gun ! - What are you talking about ? I told the sergeant Virdon had a gun . I threw it out the window . - Where ? - I 'll show ya . It 's here somewhere . [ Whispering ] Arn ! All right ! This way ! Wasn 't there anything at all in this place ? - Nothing ! Not Galen , not Burke . - Are you sure ? Of course I 'm sure ! They were gone , if they 'd ever been there . Just in the event Virdon should escape , they would leave something behind- - something that would tell him where to go . Take me there ! - [ Kraik ] Where are they ? - We 'll find out . They built it back up . Give me a hand . In the years to come , whoever finds our institute , we , the scientists , greet you . The destruction of our world as we know it is imminent , - but our civilization 's great advances must- - - [ Hoofbeats Approaching ] Come on . This way . You said there was nothing here ? - Yes , but there- - that wasn 't here before . - [ Zaius Mutters ] - What is it ? - One of these ... must be a control . [ Electronic Clicking ] We have therefore deposited the sum ... of all our scientific knowledge in a number of vaults . - What is it ? - Witchcraft ! Be quiet ! Quiet ! In this city , the vault is embedded in concrete ... on the lower level of the Midtown railway station ... at the gateway to track number four . We wish you well- - you who find and use our knowledge . - What is a railway station ? - I 've seen pictures of them . We passed such a place when we rode in . A long , narrow building . Come ! I know the place , and I know a quicker way to get there . The apes will have to ride through the cities , through places where buildings have fallen into the streets and no horses can pass . - [ Electronic Clicking ] - [ Murmurs ] Oh ! Could man ever have known so much and done so little with it ? Come on , let 's go ! Alan ! Alan , where ya been ? We thought you were dead . Listen , we spent two hours breakin' into this place . It 's a gold mine ! Yes , it is . But it 'll be a mausoleum if we don 't get out . Urko and Zaius are on their way here right now . We gotta move . Come on . [ Hoofbeats Approaching ] Knowledge- - death , destruction . In the history of this world , one has been the same as the other . Destroy everything in here ! Burn this place to the ground . - [ Grunting ] - Wait ! Wait ! What is here would give us great power ! The knowledge would be safe with us . We 're not like humans . Would we really be better off or safer ? Remember- - once the knowledge in here is set free , - it will spread out of control . - I will be in control ! You are now ! You have weapons , troops . Suppose one of your officers learns the secrets in there . He 'll have the power to destroy you , to destroy the world . - Would you risk that ? - [ Grunting ] Burn it . Burn it ! Virdon is no longer of any use to us . I 'll go back to the castle and kill him . [ Alan ] Is that the farm ? - Tomar 's brother- - what 's his name ? - Derlin . It 's so quiet . Peaceful . You , uh--you do feel all right about coming back here . It 's different now . I- - I-I-I can 't explain . Maybe because Kraik 's with me . Maybe ' cause I 'm not so alone ... inside myself anymore . [ Kraik ] Why don 't you stay with us ? - He can 't . - Why ? You 're gonna like it here , Kraik . You 'll get plenty to eat . - Every day ? - If you behave yourself . Alan ! Uh , there are two times when you shake hands- - when strangers meet , and when friends say good-bye . God bless you both .

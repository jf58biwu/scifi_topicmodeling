( Helen ) You promised one more ! ( Woman ) Oh , Henry ! ( Helen ) Please , Daddy ! ( Henry ) Oh , all right . Little Miss Muffet , but this time you do it all by yourself , all right ? ( Helen ) Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey ( Helen and Henry ) There came a big spider which sat down beside her ... ( All ) And frightened Miss Muffet away !

( Mother ) Oh , all right , just the one . # Ring-a-ring o ' roses A pocketful of posies # Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down ! # ( Humming , clocks ticking ) ( Humming stops ) ( Clock stops ) ( Ticking stops ) ( Alarm clock stops ) Dad ? ( Shimmering hum ) Dad , what 's that noise ? All the clocks have ... 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' ( Helen sobbing ) ( Rhythmic creaking ) Where 's Mum and Dad ? Gone . It 's all right , Helen , I 'm here . So where are they , Mum and Dad ? - Gone . - Gone ? Gone where ? Out of the door downstairs ? Well , where , then ? Just ... just went away . Here , in the room ? ( Sighs ) You mean they disappeared , Helen ? Yes . Mummy and Daddy , they just went away . But not here , not in the room ? Yes . Just went away . ( Whispers ) It 's all right . ( Wind whistling outside ) ( Gate bangs outside ) ( Footsteps outside ) Drink your milk , Helen . Everything 's all right . I ran to the phone at Skarl 's Edge , telephoned the policeman 's house . I told him . He 's coming out here . So everything 's all right , then , isn 't it ? That policeman , he 'll only have to come across the bay in a boat and he 'll be here . So just drink your milk , everything 's gonna be all right . - ( Knock at door ) - Stay there . Who is it ? - ( Man ) Robert Steven Jardine ? - Yes . - You asked for help . - I did , yes . Then unlock the door . That was quick ... I 've only just phoned ... I don 't know you ! Only ... the policeman at the Point . The policeman isn 't coming . I 've told him everything here is under control . But it isn 't ! I know . That 's why we 're here and not him . - You 'll get used to him . - He 's got no right to tell them ... - Your parents have disappeared . - Yes . - And you want them back , safely ? - Yes . Well , your policeman with his idiot notebook and questions stands no chance of getting them back . But we do . Whatever it is that 's happened to them , my parents ... is it serious ? ( Distant rhythmic thudding ) Yes . ( Steel ) How old is the house ? At a rough estimate , 250 years . It 's old land , arable land . Probably been that way for centuries . There could have been other buildings here . Yes . Genuine antiques ? I 'd say most of them . - Some vibrations . - And the surname , " Jardine . " Old French . The father 's name is Henry , the mother is Sarah , and child is Helen . How do you know ? Old names , an old house . Lots of old things . - Lots of old ... old echoes . - A pressure point , then ? Could well be . Could well be it . - You know so much about us ... - We do , yes . Then who are you , what are your names ? My name is Sapphire and my friend 's name is Steel . - Sapphire ? - Yes . - That 's ... - What ? - That 's a beautiful name . - Thank you . There are lots of clocks in this house . - My father fixes them . - Why don 't they work ? They do work . - They all stopped when ... - Yes ? Well , just before it happened . I did search the house after . When it happened where were you ? - In this room . - And your parents were where ? In Helen 's room at the top , they were reading to her . Mummy and Daddy just went away . I think we 'd better go up to the top room . We 'll take some clocks with us . Bring the child . When the clocks stopped , did you hear anything ? I heard Helen crying . Anything else ? Well , there was this kind of sound . - What kind of sound ? - Well ... - Describe it . - It was like a low rumbling sound . So where have they gone ? My parents ! Look , I want to know ! Now ! I mean , you ... you come here just like that , this place , where we can hear people or cars approaching from miles away , - but you two arrived just like that . - Yes . So ... Well , I want to know at least something before we go in there . - There is a corridor ... - ' It can 't be explained to him . ' 'It can in a way , but not by you , perhaps . ' There is a corridor , and the corridor is time . It surrounds all things and it passes through all things . Oh , you can 't see it . Only sometimes , when it 's dangerous . This corridor , can you enter it ? Not in the way you imagine , you cannot enter into time . But sometimes , time can try to enter into the present , break in , burst through and take things . Take people . The corridor is very strong - it has to be - but sometimes in some places it becomes weakened . Like fabric , worn fabric . And when pressure is put upon the fabric ... ( Rob ) Time comes in . ( Sapphire ) And takes what it wants . And we think that time has broken into that room , broken through and taken away your parents . Come on . - ( Rob ) Will they work again ? - Yes . They 've simply wound themselves down . But my father winds them every day . I expect he does . Clocks don 't do that , it isn 't possible . No . And yet it happened . You were here with your parents before you went downstairs ? And that 's the last you saw of them ? ( Rob ) Yes . ( Steel ) Where was the child ? ( Rob ) In bed . - Like that ? - Kneeling . - Kneel . - It 's all right , Helen . - Your father was where ? - In that chair . Sit in it will you , please ? What ? Just sit there . ( Steel ) Please don 't touch anything . Your mother was in the rocking chair ? ( Rob ) Yes . - All three like this , then ? - Yes . I take it your mother was reading to the child ? Yes . - Reading from this book ? - She did it ... She does it every night . - My dad sits with them . - Traditional nursery rhymes . Which rhyme was being read when the clocks began to stop ? - No . - When things began to happen . No , I was downstairs . It is important to know the exact rhyme . - Do you know which one it was ? - Helen ? She 's not very talkative with strangers . Then you try . Helen , just before Mama went away , you remember ? What was she reading to you - which nursery rhyme ? I don 't know . - You do know . Tell us . Please . - The first one . Your favourite , Ring-a-ring o ' roses ? Good . ( Sapphire ) That dates back to the time of the plague . Yes , another echo , another ingredient . - ( Sapphire ) I 've found it . - Wait . Read the rhyme carefully . Whenever I raise my hand stop , when I lower it continue . Right . If I say " back , back , " reverse the order of the words immediately . - I know . - But carefully . Not one mistake , not even one wrong letter . No . All right . Now ... begin . Ring-a-ring o ' roses A pocketful of posies Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down The king has ... ( Clock ticking ) The king has sent his daughter To fetch a pail of water ... ( Ticking stops ) Go on . Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down - The bird upon the steeple ... - ( Knock at door ) Sits high above the people Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all fall down The cows are in the meadow Lying fast asleep Atishoo ! Atishoo ! We all get up again ( Wind howling ) - ( Screams ) - ( Glass smashes ) The cows are in the meadow Lying fast asleep - Atishoo ! Atishoo ... - ( Man ) ' Cattle in the meadow 'Lying fast asleep - ' Hush , hush ... ' - ( Sapphire ) Atishoo ! Atishoo ! - We all fall down . - ( Man ) ' Get up again ... ' Cattle in the meadow Lying fast asleep Hush , hush Hush , now we all get up ... - No ! - Back , backwards ! ... in the meadow , lying ... - Ringing are bells wedding the Singing are girls and boys the Tishoo-a ! Tishoo-a ! Down fall all we Down fall all we . - Pictures ! Saw pictures ! - Yes , Helen . - So it 's there . - Yes . - We can 't seal it ? - Not till we 've got the people back . Tear the rhyme out of the book . Destroy it . Has the child somewhere else to sleep ? - My room . - Take her there , then . Come on . Becca ! - Is there a key to this door ? - No , it was lost . No one is to come back into this room , do you understand ? Not till we 've done what we have to . Take it downstairs ... and burn it . Helen 's fast asleep . Oh , I suppose I 've surprised you . Well , I fancied a change . Steel said I shouldn 't used time as a wardrobe but ... he 's so serious . I get bored wearing the same old clothes . - Now , salt and pepper ? - Over there . - Where did you get them ? - What ? - The clothes . - These aren 't real . - Not real ? - No , these aren 't real ones . Salt and pepper . This was my favourite last week - what do you think ? - Well , I think that ... - Yes ? - I just think that you 're beautiful . - Thank you . And the name , Sapphire , like blue , as if you were blue . - And Steel ? - I suppose he 's like steel . Grey . ( Chuckles ) The corridor , have you ever seen inside it ? Not properly , I did catch a glimpse once on a ship . - A ship ? - Mm , in the middle of the sea . - It was simple , we fixed it . - And you saw ? Just a glimpse . It was like looking through frosted glass , all blurred . - Like the images upstairs ? - Yes . Sorry . When you 've told him about the nicer aspects tell him about the dangers . - He knows about them . - He knows about them ? About the dangers in this house ? - The corridor ... - Don 't try and imagine it . It 's immense . Time is immense . Try and imagine instead , you , Rob , or your lifetime , as approximately one inch in length . Then compare it to the corridor of time which is ... a thousand million miles long . One inch - you - time and the unknown - a thousand million miles . Just compare them . It 's very , very big and it 's very , very dangerous . ( Rob ) Dangerous ? ( Steel ) There are things , creatures , if you like , from the very beginnings of time and the very end of time . These creatures have access to the corridor . They 're forever moving along it . Searching , looking , trying to find a way in . They 're always searching . Always looking . - For the hole in the fabric ? - Yes . But they must never be allowed in . Never ever . You 've seen what can happen , upstairs this evening . - But we stopped them . - ( Clocks ticking ) Held them . Took the trigger away from them . ( Rob ) The trigger ? Yes , the final ingredient . A certain traditional nursery rhyme spoken in a certain room . ( Door creaks ) ( Wind whistling outside ) Mama ? Daddy ? No pictures . No pictures , Rebecca . # Ring-a-ring o ' roses # A pocketful of posies ... # That 's why we tore it out . - # Ring-a-ring o ' roses ... # - That 's why we burned it . # Atishoo ! Atishoo !

 I won . What do you mean , you won ? You did not . I did too . The old man can still beat him . - Oh , come on , Dad . You saw it , didn 't you ? I won . - Close . Really close . - Yeah . - All right . If it was close , let 's go again . We 'll go ... Wait a minute . How many times do I have to beat you ? - You beat me ? - Yeah , I beat you . - Hey . Hey ! - All right ! Listen , you won ! Leave your father alone . All this exercise is making me hungry . Come on , Dad . All right , you won . No , no . You won . - No , you won . - No , no . You won . - No , you won . - Mr. Childress ? Telephone for you , sir , on the terrace . Better get here as soon as you can . I 'll tell Peter . Hey , what will living in the States be like , Dad ? I don 't know . You 've been away a long time . Yeah , it 's been since Mom died . Yeah . Why Chicago ? Good school for you . The best . - You could go out for football . - What , and give up soccer ? Well , football 's more popular in the States . Football players are more popular with the girls . Dad . I don 't know . School and sports , all that stuff - I just won 't fit in there . Feel like some kind of freak . - What is this ? - I don 't know . Maybe if I knew what was wrong with me . There 's nothing wrong with you . Well , I might do okay in a zoo . Now , what the hell are you doing ? Feeling sorry for yourself ? Okay , you have a talent that would shock the hell out of people , but it 's a talent that also can be put to good use . - Dad ... - It 's nothing to be ashamed of . Now , Childress understands this . That 's why he wants you to go to this school in Chicago . You 'll meet other kids that are ... that are special like you . Robin , I 'll be with you all the way . If it doesn 't work out , we 'll do something else . Robin . Do me a favor . I want to talk to your father alone one minute . Sure . I 'll be on the terrace , Dad . Okay . Peter , you 've gotta give me the telephone number ... of that dame from the antique shop . Nothing antique about her . Everything works . Gonna miss you . Well , I 'm not gonna miss you . Twenty years together in the same agency is more than enough . You taught me a lot . - No , you did . - Look , if this is gonna be a teary farewell , get your ass out of here . No tears . All laughs . Right . I 'll say good-bye to your son over there . Waiter . Regular luncheon for two . My dad ! Get Robin out of here ! - Dad . - Robin , your father 's all right . He 's a professional . They 're after my dad . Robin , they 're after all of us . For Christ 's sakes . Dad ? They killed my dad . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . They killed my dad . It 's all right . Robertson , where the hell are you ? Give me the gun ! I 'm gonna find out who broke that security . - I 'll check on it . - No ! Get this boy out of here . - Come on , Robin . Move . Let 's go . Into the car . - Get him out of here . - Let 's go . Hurry . Come on ! - It 'll be all right , Robin . It 'll be all right . - I 'm sorry , sir . - It 's all right , Jonathan . You did a very good job . - Thank you . - I 'm proud of you . - Up by the road . Go on . - Sure . Give me the film . That 's the great Johnny Dunbar . In Chicago it 's already 87 degrees this morning , 13 minutes after 10 : 00 . So I said , " Mother , what do you want from me ? " I mean , you got this terrific job . You 're all over the world . I mean , I get to see you maybe once a month , if I 'm lucky , right ? " Okay , I 'm happy for you . I really am . " But I said , " Just don 't try and run my life ... " when you happen to be around the house for a few days ... " and feel like playing mom . " I know . They just ... They just don 't know how to let go , and they get so hurt when you try to explain to them . Really . Anyway , let 's see if you know this junk . January 10 , 1946 . That was the first United Nations General Assembly ... that was held in London , right ? - Good . - See , I told you . I never forget dates . All right . Who was elected president of the assembly ? It 's names I have trouble with . - LaRue , don 't tell me . - I didn 't say anything . Yes , you did . You said " Raymond . " I heard you . I did not . Raymond ? His name wasn 't Raymond . It was ... Raymond Dunwoodie . Who was Raymond Dunwoodie ? I don 't know . It 's just ... That-That name just came into my head . I don 't know . So what was the right answer ? Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium . Oh , yes , Paul-Henri Spaak . Okay . Next . I always get that one wrong . " The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are ? " The United States , Russia ... I know . Let 's just forget the whole thing . Forget it ? Are you crazy ? We 've got a final . LaRue , I know this stuff . - We have a final at 2 : 00 . - I know , and I 'm gonna pass with flying colors . I promise you . - Hey , guess what . - What ? We got a buddy . Oh , my God . What a ... What a creep . He 's walking backwards now . - Should we give him money ? - No ! God , what do you take me for ? I don 't know . Oh , he 's not gonna bother us . - I hope we pass . - Sure ! - Here . - Two popcorns , please . - Hello ? - Mr. Johnson ? Yes ? It 's Raymond Dunwoodie . What is it , Raymond ? Now , look , I haven 't changed my mind . I mean , there 's nothing I can do for you personally , but I may have somebody to locate your son . You 'd better not be wasting my time . No , no . I 'm at the beach , and I made a contact . She 's a kid ... m-maybe 17 ... and she 's psychic . Are you sure ? That 's right , she 's psychic . Bring her here . I don 't have her yet , but I could get her . Now , look , Mr. Johnson ? This is gonna cost . How much ? I don 't mean 50 or 100 bucks . Not for this girl . How much , Raymond ? $ 1,000 . I don 't have that kind of money . Oh , that 's a sad story , Mr. J. Almost as sad as the story you told me about your boy . Dunwoodie paid off for us . We 've completed the trace . He 's talking to Sandza at the Plymouth Hotel . Step inside , off the street . Yes , sir . Is this man registered here ? I don 't know . I just came on a half hour ago myself . We think he 's been here a few days . You ain 't the police , is you ? Oh , well , I 'm what you 'd consider well-traveled , but I don 't believe I ever heard of you gentlemen . We don 't spend a dime on public relations . Yeah , well , that would be Mr. R.V. Johnson , Room 512 , just down the hall to your left . Hey , government man . Don 't bust my door down , please . Use the pass key . Chase 1 to Chase 2 ... He 's loose . Do you copy ? He 's loose . Do you copy ? Chase 1 to Chase 2 . He 's loose . Do you copy ? Gunmen of the Hanafi Muslim sect ... continue their siege of three Washington buildings . Damn it . Did you hear that , Vivian ? Now , that 's what I 'm talking about ! Them bozos in Washington are mugging the whole damn country . They got every court in the land helping ' em make it legal . Yeah , well , if you ask me what happened to the milk of human kindness , I 'd have to tell you , frankly , that the whole world has dried up at the tit . You can say that again , pal . I swear to hell , I don 't know where ... Vivian ! Yes , Mother Nuckells . I 'm coming . Couldn 't you just once manage to go potty by yourself ? Somebody 's in my room ! All right , now . Nobody 's going to get hurt . I just want some clothes . He came in my window . Do you know who he is ? I told you we should 've moved to Melrose Park . Harry , this wouldn 't be happening if we lived in Melrose Park . You want clothes . Old clothes . Anything you 've got . You can see , I need clothes . I can 't go anywhere like this . Just ... the clothes . Yes . Oh , I had to leave the hotel in a hurry , so could you spare a couple of dollars ? I knew it . This is a graphic example of biofeedback . We 're converting the very low-voltage alpha-wave energy ... into electricity to run that train . And that train will only run when my friend Hester ... is in alpha . Now , as you may have hoped , there are more practical applications to biofeedback training . If you can learn to regulate your brain waves , you can gain control of your heart rate , blood pressure , headaches , backaches , even , ladies , cold feet . Now , I work at the Paragon Institute , where we study the phenomena of extrasensory perception . And we are using biofeedback techniques ... to tap the almost limitless resources of the human mind ... And I am speaking now of such things as thought transmissions , commonly known as telepathy . Now , that machine is called a magnetometer , and it records the fluctuations ... of the human electromagnetic field ... during our experiments , and I guess Hester 's had it . Thank you , Hester . I want to stress that no particular talent is needed to achieve this . Anybody can achieve alpha , with a little patience . - Want to try ? - Sure . Try to remember ... that " alpha " is another word for " passive . " Right . Visualize sitting in an empty theater ... in front of a blank screen , and let that screen fill your mind . - Okay . - Okay ? Gillian ? Hey , hey , hey . Are you all right ? What is she doing ? I have no idea . Don 't mind about them . It 's okay . You all right ? Creep . I 'd say I 'm pretty sound , considering the ravages of time . For instance , I don 't have the use of any more ... than one of my limbs or vital organs . Good thing the Lord God Jehovah ... built in so many spare parts . But when the old ticker gives out , well , that 's it . Ain 't that the truth . How long do you think you 'll be staying ? Oh , shut up , Vivian . Let the boy enjoy his breakfast . Thank you . What is it they want you for ? I 'm a high-level security risk . Did you get it yet ? - No . - It 's been over two months ! Would you shut up , Betsy ? It does not . I mean , it happens ... Gillian , I was saving that seat for Cheryl . Too bad . Cheryl can sit over here . Oh , God . Now what am I gonna do ? Oh , Cheryl , I 'm sorry . I tried to save a seat for you , but Gillian just took it . Look , you can have my seat . Hey , watch it . Good Lord , Pam . If you 're that nervous , why don 't you masturbate ? Are you ready for that ? Are you ready for tomorrow ? You two are so sweet . When are you getting married ? See any ghosts today , Gillian ? Cheryl , you 're not very funny . Gillian 's not very funny . I mean , there are more mature ways to get attention , don 't you think , Gillian ? Say , have you guys seen Mr. Watkins 's new girlfriend ? Oh , yeah . Where 'd he pick that chick up ? Read my mind ! What ? Tell me what I 'm thinking . Come on . Right now , read my mind . Well , that 's what they say you can do , isn 't it ? No . I don 't know how to read minds , Cheryl . That 's ridiculous . - Listen , Cheryl ... - Shut up , LaRue ! I only want to find something out . That 's all . All right . Come on . Oh , great . Good . Now pay attention , everybody . - Gillian 's gonna perform for us . - I didn 't say I ... Cheryl , look . I don 't know anything about reading minds , all right ? I mean , I don 't even know what I 'm thinking most of the time , so ... get off my back . Gillian , you 're so full of shit . Cheryl , you 're an asshole . Just shut up . She can 't help being upset . She has to take it out on someone . What did you say ? Oh , Cheryl , you don 't want everyone to know that you 're pregnant , do you ? - What ? I would like for you to explain that little remark ! - Cheryl ... Just what do you think you know about me ? - I 'm sorry . I didn 't ... - Come on , tell me ! - Let go , Cheryl . Let go . - Tell me ! - Tell me . - Cheryl , please let go . - Cheryl . - Come on , tell me . - No ! Oh , my God ! - Oh , my God ! - Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! - Are you all right , Cheryl ? Help me ! Oh , God . Oh , God ! I put some cookies in a bag for ya . You might get hungry later on . Thank you . How 's your hair ? Dry yet ? Oh , it 's fine . Hey ! Just fine . That Shinola will wash right out . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd wait till after M * A * S * H to let them go . M * A * S * H ? I 'll wait till Sunrise Semester . Might as well just leave ' em there . They ain 't got anything to say I want to hear . I 've heard it all before . Peter . That your real name ? That 's right . Can 't see a reason why you 'd make up lies to tell me . I don 't matter anyhow . I wouldn 't lie to you , Mother Nuckells . You know that . And I hope you find your son . If he 's alive , I 'll find him . And if the feds get in your way , shoot ' em . Just shoot ' em . It 's all they deserve . Yeah . There 's so many of ' em . They just keep coming . Kill ' em . Kill ' em . Now , don 't overwork yourself , Mother Nuckells . Remember , it 's bad for the old ticker ? Thank you . You want to get us out of here now ? Come on , Mother . Oh , please ! Please . ♪ I 've been walkin ' around ♪ ♪ Tryin ' to find a place to rest my head ♪ Listen , I got a good deal .

I mean , you ever heard better fucking stereo sound in your life ? How can you be sure it 's Sandza ? He had to be in the neighborhood . All we had to do was wait . I trained with him . I know his style . What 's he doing now ? Over . Looks like off-duty cops in that Cadillac ahead of us . There 's nothing he can do now . - Can I help you , pop ? - You 're under arrest . What ? You 're under arrest for impersonating police officers . Hey , hey , hey , hey , look out ! What the hell ! He 's got a piece . It 's in my armpit . All right . What do you want me to do ? Drive down that alley . Fast . Crazy son of a bitch ! Take a right . Head for Lower River Drive . Faster . Damn ! Holy shit ! Should I drive a little faster ? - No . Slower . - Slower ?

I want you to meet my partner , Officer Eggleston . Hi , hi , Peter . Why don 't you call me Bob ? Hi , Bob . Nice car . Yeah . It 's brand-new . I just picked it up about a half hour ago . I ... sure wouldn 't want anything to happen to it . Don 't blame you . That shoe polish in your hair , Peter ? Yes , it is . It 's a disguise . - It 's a pretty clever disguise . - Yeah . Didn 't work though . They were waiting for me . Must 've been waiting all day . I gotta give that Childress a lot of credit , the son of a bitch . Somebody 's after you . Is that it ? What do you suppose he 's telling those cops ? Whatever it is , they won 't believe him . I worked for a government agency you never heard of . They took my son away from me . They needed him , so they just took him . Keep your hand in your lap , Marty . It 's a frightening power these people have . They can make anybody disappear anytime . Somebody 's gotta stop ' em . Yeah , well , that 's right , and if you don 't mind my making a suggestion , maybe we can help . Yeah . You see , Peter , Marty and myself ... have had a lot of experience dealing with ... you know ... - People who like kicking other people around . - Yeah , harassing them . - I got an idea . - Hey , that 's a terrific idea , Marty . - Why don 't we stop for some coffee ? - Don 't stop ! Let 's get the hell off this drive ! We 're like sitting ducks down here ! All right . Easy , man , easy . We 're on your side . We 're just trying to help . Chase 1 to Top Guy 1 . We 've got him on the lower drive . Do you copy ? Chase 1 , copy . We 're right above you . Two sedans have been following us . Standard government issue . He 's right about that . They ... Bob . - Yes , sir ? - I want you to lose those cars . - Lose ? - That 's right . Well how do you suppose I should go about it ? There 's a construction site other side of the bridge . When we get there , I want you to follow my instructions exactly , understand ? Bob , if they can make me disappear , they can make you disappear too . Chase cars , pull up alongside the Cadillac . Let 's find out what Peter has in mind . Something 's going on here . Look like feds to you ? Who knows ? Peter , I 'm worried about that gun going off , you know , by accident , if we hit a few bumps . You got something to worry about there . You say across the bridge when the light changes ? We 're not gonna wait for the lights to change , Bob . We 're not ? Go ! Oh , God . Please , God , don 't let anything happen to my new car . Chase 1 to Top Guy 1 . He 's crossing bridge into fog . Losing visual contact . Over . They 're finished . Let 's go home . That son of a bitch . Hey , watch where you 're going . I can 't see anything in this soup . - Which way ? - I don 't know . - You go straight , and I 'll go left . - All right . Now what ? Don 't know . Hear anything ? I don 't know . - Do you ? - Yeah . I definitely hear something . Chase 1 , Chase 1 . We 're in pursuit of the Caddy . I see him . I see him . He 's over there . Around to the right ! Jesus . How the hell was I suppo ... There they are . Come on ! Go on ! Get moving ! All right . Get out , both of you . Leave the motor running . I can 't believe it . Not a scratch . Throw your pieces in the lake . What are you gonna do now , Peter ? When you see Childress , ask him if it was worth his arm . What happened to his arm , Peter ? I killed it , with a machine gun . - Hey , Peter , now , wait . - Tell Childress to follow me ! I want him to follow me this time ! Not in my car , man . - Watch out , Bob ! - Hey . Wait . No , Peter ! Let 's talk about this ! Gillian , I know you 're upset , but it 's silly . I was told Cheryl has a history of nosebleeds . An ice pack stopped the bleeding in five minutes . But what I 'm trying to tell you is I made it happen . Oh , that 's impossible . Look , now , Mother , what about when you started bleeding ? Remember , a couple of weeks ago ? I mean , you said yourself that cut was healed , and it opened right up . I mean ... Don 't ! Why not ? 'Cause it could happen to you . Gillian , I 've had a long flight , and I 'm very tired . And I want you to stop carrying on like this . Don 't be mad at me . Sweetheart , I 'm not . I always thought we could tell each other anything . Anything , no matter what . We can . Mother , I love you , but I 'm afraid . Afraid to let me touch you ? Yes . Honey , I 'm home , and I 'll stay here just as long as you need me . I promise . But what we really should do now is talk to someone . And Steve Brenneman has had wonderful success working with therapy ... Mother , I 'm not going to a psychiatrist . Hello ? Oh , it 's you . Oh , that was a good one . Really passionate . I ... I need ... I 'm ... Listen , I 'm a nurse , and if my phone 's tied up ... and they can 't get hold of me ... So maybe you could breathe for someone else tonight . I ... I need ... I need ... I ... I need your body , baby ! Come on , baby , it 's me ! Oh . Oh , my God . Why do we always have to meet in this van ? Couldn 't we go to my place just this once ? Too dangerous . Well , for the sake of argument , let 's assume that everybody at the institute ... has their phones tapped . But nobody 's watching me , for heaven 's sakes . They 're always watching . Raymond Dunwoodie was a psychic , and if he 'd had enough time , he 'd have found Robin for me . But Childress was watching him . How else you think they got to me ? Why are you so afraid of this guy ? I 'm not afraid of Childress . He 's afraid of me . He knows I 'll get my son back . Now , what about those files ? I 'm nobody . I just work there . I don 't have access to any vital secrets . You mean you didn 't get a chance to examine the files at Paragon ? - Yes , I did . - And ? Robin is ... Well , he 's ... Dead . - According to the records ... - Of course that 's what the records say . Childress keeps the records . What if it 's true ? Hester , look at me . I 'm proof-proof that my son is alive , or else why would Childress be so anxious to put me away ? Well , thank God I 'm somewhere . You 're the only one who can help me . How long did you follow me around ... before taking a chance on me ? Too long . Well , thanks . Thanks for picking me . You know what , Hester ? You don 't realize how beautiful you really are . Somewhere , they 're doing a hell of a lot of research ... much more complicated than Paragon . God only knows what they 're doing to my son . Peter , if Robin is still ... Well , I promise I 'll do everything I can to help find Robin . But you take too much for granted . You trust too many people . Paragon Institute . Sounds like a haven for quacks . But their references are good . Hey , it 's right up there on the left . Gil , the more I think about it , the more I 'm convinced ... this is not an appropriate course of action . Mother , I like Dr. Lindstrom . Anyway , I 'm old enough to know what I 'm doing . Well , I don 't intend to let you stay here ... until they 've answered a lot of questions , - and I mean that , Gillian . - Okay . - Hi , Gillian . - Hi . - Mrs. Bellaver . - Yes . I 'm Ellen Lindstrom . How do you do ? - Please come in . - Thank you . Dr. McKeever is busy monitoring a test , but he should be with us shortly . Maybe you 'd like to look around . Thank you . I 've been here before . This was Babe Gifford 's house . Yes . We bought the house from the Giffords . It was so beautifully furnished . We tried to make as few alterations as possible . As a matter of fact , Gillian 's suite is particularly attractive . I don 't understand why you want Gillian to stay here . That was my idea , Mrs. Bellaver . Gillian and Catherine Bellaver , - this is our director , Jim McKeever . - Mrs. Bellaver . How do you do ? - Gillian . - Hi . We have young people staying with us all the time while they help with our evaluation program . Thanks , Ellie . We can do a better job of judging psychic ability ... if there 's a minimum of distractions . Of course , it 's not all work and no play . There 's a good library right here and a game room down the hall . Do you play backgammon , Gillian ? - Yeah . - Good . And our housekeeper is the best Irish cook in Chicago , I 'm sorry to say . I 'd like to know what kind of program you 're talking about , Doctor . Oh , certainly . Why don 't we have a look at one of our workshops ? Telepathy is a timeless form of communication . Now , my five-year-old daughter was very good at this . But the older and more sophisticated we become , the more we rationalize what our senses try to tell us . Is this all Gillian will be doing ? Yes . This and similar tests under my personal supervision . We 'll take very good care of her , Mrs. Bellaver . I 'll be fine . Don 't worry . And I 'll see you in a couple of weeks , okay ? Well , all right , but I 'll call you the minute I get to Paris . - And you know where I 'm staying in case you change your mind . - Mother , I 'll be fine . Good-bye . Good-bye . Good-bye , Mrs. Bellaver . Nice meeting you . Good-bye , Gillian . Have a good trip . Oh , my God . It 's beautiful . Do you like it ? Geez , look at this . It 's great ! I got my own stereo . I 'll start unpacking . - You just look around , make yourself comfortable . - This is beautiful . " Paragon . " That 's the best there is , right ? Something that can 't be equaled , like the incredible power of the human mind . We hope you 'll learn to use that power to develop your gift . It 's not a gift . It 's more like having a bad tooth and never knowing when it 's gonna hurt . That 's because a part of the mind you 've never used before ... becomes sensitized . Sensitized to what ? The bioplasmic universe . Come again ? The bioplasmic universe . And in that universe is a record ... of every human impulse , word and deed ... of lives past and lives to come . Occasionally , you make a ... a connection ... between the timeless world ... and the physical world . You have what clairvoyants call " a vision . " Yeah , but it 's never about me though . I mean , I never see anything about me . So I 'm glad I don 't . Which one is me ? Mine just keeps drifting along . Hester ! Quit shooting me . This is great . I 've been thinking . We should have a little treat . Just for ourselves . - Like what ? - Hot fudge sundaes . Vanilla and chocolate ice cream . - Hester . - Bananas , maraschino cherries . Coconut , strawberry topping . - Whipped cream all over the top . - No . Stop . Ta-da ! Oh , my God . You guys ! If I don 't finish these tests pretty soon , I 'm gonna get so fat you 're gonna have to roll me out of here . - Well , have fun . - Thanks . Come on . You 've earned it . You 're right . What the ... Besides , what are you talking about ? You look terrific . Not after this . - You have a boyfriend ? - No . No one special . What about you ? Pretty slim pickings around here . Yeah , Paragon is just a job . Well , do you have a boyfriend ? Have I got a boyfriend ! What is he like ? Well , he 's very charming . He swept me right off my feet , in the park . In the park ? Yeah . He picked me up in the park . What was his line ? H-He said he needed help . Some line . What are you talking about ? It worked . True . What does he do ? Do ? Oh , he-he travels around a lot . Where ? Oh , all over . You know . Oh , when he comes to town , we go to ... parties . He loves people . He takes me out dancing , buys me presents . Oh , he dresses beautifully , and he 's a good dancer . Yeah ? The only trouble is , he 's very hard to get hold of . Oh , come on . Let 's dig in . You mean gross out . Look at this . And when I was your age , I had one great ambition . - What ? - To be Fred Astaire . Oh , my God . As you can see , I failed miserably . Well , I took dance for a couple of years . Yes . My mother insisted . You see , she didn 't think I was any too graceful . Don 't-Don 't touch me anymore . Please don 't touch me . Oh , God ! God ! What happened ? Tomorrow , we do some real testing , make things as challenging as possible for Gillian . Nelson , as soon as Gillian begins to demonstrate her psychometric talents , I want complete audio and videotape records of the tests . Will she be working in the Faraday cage ? No , no , no . This girl 's not a cheat . She 's the real thing . Now , do we have any bleeders in the group ? No . Anyone who 's had even minor surgery in the past three months ? No , sir . How about ulcers ? Hester , Kristen , Lorraine , if you girls are into your monthlies , I don 't want you around when Gillian is testing . Are you serious ? I 'm very serious . Gillian 's power to psychometrize is spontaneous . She creates an enormously powerful electromagnetic field . Almost everyone exposed to it will bleed . Some will bleed a little , some a lot . What is this kid , a vampire ? Do you want to continue working here ? Then I don 't want to hear any more funny remarks like that ! How do you account for it ? We can 't account for it . Not yet . Gillian , can you hear me ? Jim , it takes a few moments for the Evapil to take effect . Ellie , please . Gillian , what did you see on the stairs ? A boy . Robin . Have you seen him before ? Yeah . I have . Gillian and Robin were in touch telepathically . Think of what we would accomplish if Robin were alive . - I 'm sending her home . - Jim . Why ? Because I don 't want to be responsible for Gillian Bellaver . - I don 't think you mean ... - Ellie , I don 't want to talk about it anymore ! It 's late . And we 're both overexcited . Listen , I don 't understand something . This is a marvelous opportunity for us . We only had Robin for a few days , but I think that Gillian really wants to work with us , and she is the best subject for psychic research I have ever seen . Ellie , even the most backward tribes , the most primitive cultures on earth , would welcome the birth of a Robin Sandza . And in time , he 'd become their magician , their prophet , their great healer . But there is no place for these kids in our culture ... because they 're so superior to what we hold sacred . And what a culture can 't assimilate , it destroys . Jim , what really happened to Robin Sandza ? He was running on the steps , taking them ... two or three at a time , and he ... slipped , went through the window . But why was he running ? I don 't know , Ellie . I wasn 't here . Jim . Why don 't you come up to my place ? I mean , I 'll scramble some eggs ... No . I 'm ... I 'm gonna finish this . Then I 'm gonna ... stretch out on the couch for a couple of hours . What time is it ? My watch has stopped . It 's a quarter after 4 : 00 . Excuse me . It 's later than I thought . Thanks , Ellie . Well , good night , Jim . Morning . What do you want ? My arm hurts . It 's dead . Why should it still hurt ? You 're the brain expert , so tell me . Is it all in my head , Doctor ? That 's an oversimplification , but there 's nothing I can do . That 's not why I came here . Tell me about Gillian Bellaver . My people always know what 's going on here , even if you 're slow to keep me informed . Will the girl be another Robin Sandza ? - No . - Really ? Poor Peter . If he only knew that Robin doesn 't care anymore ... doesn 't care if his father 's alive or dead . What the hell have you done to that boy ? Oh , he 's being treated like a prince . He is . He 's royalty . Unique . Chinese don 't have one . Soviets don 't have one . In all the world , there 's no one quite like Robin Sandza ... unless it 's this girl . How can you hold him against his will and get any kind of results ? Against his will ? You don 't understand Robin 's needs . We do . Are you testing the girl today ? She 's ... failed every test . She 's a fake . I 'm sending her home . I don 't have time to waste on people ... Don 't do that to me , Doctor . Don 't ever try lying to me . For God 's sakes , she 's just a child . She doesn 't know anything . She has no control over what she 's doing . Robin had no control when he came here . Just raw ability . Doctor , I wish you could see him now . For God 's sakes . I want you to get yourself together . Stop fudging your responsibilities . This girl is important to me . I 'm assigning extra security . Why ? If I know Peter , he penetrated your security weeks ago . He probably knows I have Gillian Bellaver . I don 't know who his confederate is , but I 'm looking into it . She 's all right . Try that one . I will , I will . Kristen , where 's Dr. McKeever ? Oh , he 's down at Medtronics , checking out the new testing equipment . Do you know when he 'll be back ? He said not before dinner . Where 's Gillian ? Having breakfast . I could use a cup of coffee myself . A club . Good morning , Gillian . You 're not eating much . I 'm not very hungry . Did you hear what happened yesterday ? Dr. McKeever 's hand started bleeding . Yes , I do know about that . Well , what are you gonna do about it ? I mean , it 's why I 'm here , isn 't it ? I mean , can 't anybody help me ? Gillian , we have to work together . Gillian , do you remember much of what we talked about last night ? Last night ? - Were you here last night , Dr. Lindstrom ? - That 's right . While you were with Dr. McKeever , you had some sort of vision that upset you . You were in a fugue state for a while . We gave you something to help you relax , and I made the suggestion that you consciously forget whatever was troubling you . And , apparently , it worked better than I thought . So , you don 't remember anything about Robin Sandza ? No . Who 's Robin Sandza ? He 's a boy your age ... with powers like yours . Like me ? Well , where is he ? I mean , do you think I could talk to him ? Do you know him ? I feel like I do . What can you tell me about him ? He 's ... It 's not very clear . He 's ... He 's , like , dreaming or ... not ... awake yet . Drugged . Stop ! Just relax , Robin . Relax . It 's gonna be okay . Gillian , where are you ? Get that light off him . Disturbance in the magnetic field on the last P.K. Trial was to cast a character with a parametrical resonance on a frequency of five cycles . We 'll go for a magnetometer check now . The infrared area scanning system is operational . With this trial , we want a two-dimensional view of the field potentials . We have a mild electrostatic field fluctuation . We have differentiation between the " P " and " T " waves . Heart action slightly arrhythmic . Let me have that electrogram reading again , please . Pulse , 66 . Pressure , 114 over 92 . Pulse steady at 67 . Pressure , 115 over 94 . Robin , we 're going to show you a film . Now , there 's nothing in there that can possibly harm you , but you must keep watching , okay ? Pulse beginning to rise , 73 . Pressure , 115 over 94 . Magnetometer holding at 640 . Pulse is 78 . Pressure , 129 over 111 . No . Keep watching . Keep watching . We have a mild electrostatic field fluctuation . Body temperature , 89.59 . Pulse steady at 65 . Robin , please , keep watching . Heartbeat , brain , relative to force field fluctuation in ratio . No ! No ! Robin , please , for God 's sake , watch the screen . - Gillian ! - Slight increase in activity ... Gillian ! Where is Robin now , Gillian ? My dad ! They 're after my dad ! Dad ! No ! Hester ! Oh , my God . Oh , my God , listen . I need to talk to my mother . Do you think I could call my mother ? You can talk to your mom in a little while , but you 've had an awful shock , and you need to rest . - Here . - What ... What is that ? It 's a sedative . It 's like aspirin . You take aspirin , don 't you ? Here 's some water . Drink plenty of water . Oh , that 's a good girl . - I need to see Dr. McKeever . - Sure . I have to know what happened to Ellen . They 'll be here in a little while . Just ... I 'll stay here with you . Just lie down and-and relax . No , no . I gotta get out of here . - I gotta go ... home . - It 's all right , Gillian . Everything will be all right . We 'll take good care of you . Now don 't worry . Ellen 's X-rays were encouraging . She 's beginning to show signs of consciousness . It had to be a cerebral hemorrhage , something in the brain . She 's a fake . You were gonna send her home . Is that the kind of cooperation I can expect , Doctor ? I want Gillian Bellaver at the P.S. I. Facility tomorrow . Do we let her mother know ? She 's wealthy . She has powerful friends . Gillian can 't just dis ... Peter , it 's impossible . I 'll never be able to get that girl out of that place . I 'll blow it . Getting out of Paragon is a hell of a lot easier than getting in . What do I say to Gillian ? Tell her everything . Tell her what they did to Robin . They 'll do the same thing to her . - What if she won 't listen to me ? - Look , I don 't have much time . That girl can lead me to Robin . Well , she was doped the last time I saw her . - Everything is set for tomorrow . - Tomorrow ? I need your help . Please . You feel all right , Robin ? You know , that wasn 't a very smart thing to do . You could 've been very badly hurt . Why were you running away ? I mean , you didn 't have to use the window . There is a door . Yeah . Like they 'd really let me just walk out the door . Why didn 't you come to me ? 'Cause you 're one of them . I just wanna get out of here . I hate this place . Hate these doctors and the tests . Driving me crazy . I can 't even sleep . And you want to get away from me too . Is that it ? Well , what do you care ? I care very much . What 's the matter , Robin ? Don 't you trust me anymore ? I-I don 't know . But you do want to get out of here , don 't you ? Yeah . All right . Then we 'll go together . - Go where ? - Gillian . Well , I have this place in the country , north of Chicago in Lakeview . Gillian ? You can do whatever you like . You don 't have to see anybody . You don 't have to talk to anybody ... not even me . Really ? Yes , really . Would you like to do that ? Sure . Gillian ? Hi , Hester . I 've been looking everywhere for you . This was Robin 's room when he was here . Yes , it was . He 's in terrible trouble now . Those people , they should be trying to help him . What people ? Where Robin is . But they won 't leave him alone . I mean , it was like they were deliberately trying to hurt him . - Hester . Don 't ! - Wait , wait . Come here . It 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm not bleeding . - You know where Robin is ? - Yeah , I do . Would you like to see him ? I need to see him . Well , I think we can work that out . How ? Well , Dr. McKeever says I 'm supposed to give these to you ... to keep you happy and harmless . Do you know what I mean ? - No . What ... - So you 'll have to pretend that you took them ... because I have to get you out of here tomorrow . Otherwise , you could be in terrible trouble yourself . What are you saying ? What is going on ? Honey , I 've got so much to tell you . Would you like a drink ? You look tired . I am tired . How 's our boy wonder ? Those films of his father 's death have unleashed an incredible emotional force . Why , he 's developing the power of an atomic reactor . Or an atomic bomb . What are you giving him to calm him down ? Every day , he has 3,000 milligrams of phenobarbital ... and 1,000 milligrams of Prolixin ... What the hell are you telling me ? That 's enough to kill him . Drugs no longer have any effect on him . We 've pushed him too far . He 's quite unstable . He flies into rages over nothing . He could be dangerous . What 's he trying to prove ? Mentally , Robin has developed this perfect psychotronic relationship ... with all kinds of machines . And so , naturally , he 's trying to do the same thing now with his body . Except that , physically , he 's just adequate , and when he fails , he 's intolerable . How is he performing in bed ? Robin wants to please me . That 's the main thing , isn 't it ? He needs a rest . No more tests for at least a month . Sorry . He 's been under tremendous pressure . We plan to get away , just the two of us . No . We almost lost him once , Susan . I promised . I promised him we 'd get away together . All right . Take him into the city , show him the sights , but get him back here in 24 hours . Well , there you are . Who are they ? These are friends of mine from the institute . Are you planning on seeing them later ? No , Robin . I 'm with you . Remember ? And which one are you gonna screw first ? Robin , come here . Come on . - Get away from me . - Robin , please . Oh , my God ! Top Guy 2 , this is Top Guy 1 . Do you have any coffee left ? Top Guy 1 , that 's an affirmative . I 've got about a cup of lukewarm coffee left . You wanna negotiate a trade ? Top Guy 2 , I have one Hershey bar to trade . Top Guy 1 , I read you . Is that with or without almonds ? All right , Asshole 1 and Asshole 2 , stop cluttering up this frequency . Isn 't Dr. McKeever back yet ? Oh , I 'm afraid not , Hester . He 's still at the hospital with Ellen . Can I help ? Dr. McKeever prescribed medication for Gillian this morning , but we 're all out of it . He was very specific about using a non-barbiturate . So , I guess I 'd better go down to the drugstore . Fine . Hey . - Are these ready to be mailed yet ? - Yeah , why ? I could take them down to the post office for you . That would be terrific . Oh , I 'd really appreciate that , Hester . Here , these go in . These have to be stamped . And that stuff . Whoops . Here comes the pony express ! Oh , hi . Will you be gone long ? Oh , no . I have to go ... I have to whiz to the drugstore . I have to whiz to the post office . I have so many things to do , I 'll never get through the day . Oh , I 'm silly . I can 't go without the card . Door card . Where is that card ? I haven 't the vaguest idea . How 's Gillian ? She 's doing just fine . That 's good . Gillian ? How about a bacon , lettuce and tomato sandwich ? - Okay . - Good girl . Oh , damn . Oh , I 'll give you a hand . - Don 't bother . Don 't bother . - It 's no bother . I can take care of it . It 's okay . Oh , for God 's sake , move your ass . Oh , I 'll get that , Gillian . Here 's some more , Hester . I killed her . I knew I would the first time I said hello . I conned her into helping me . She would have done anything for me . Hey , you better get some sleep . Don 't stop . Please keep talking . I 'm afraid to close my eyes , afraid of what I 'll see . - Sip this . - I don 't want it . Sip it . You 'll feel better . It 's the best thing in the world for a toothache . Tell me about Robin . You tell me . It 's just that ... sometimes I know what 's happening to him , what he 's ... thinking , what he 's feeling . I 'm ... like a receiver , and-and Robin sends me pictures . Jesus , that 's amazing . Like twins . He 's a good-looking kid . You know , you 're the kind of girl Robin would like . I raised him myself . His mother died at childbirth . How come you didn 't marry again ? Just hasn 't been anybody . Hester ? Yeah . Hester . I 'm s ... Hey . Hey , when was the last time you saw Robin ? Oh , about 11 months . He 's been growing up so fast . You know , I 'm a good athlete , but he 's better . The last at the club , we raced in the pool about 10 laps , and he beat me , but I said , " I won . " He said , " No , you didn 't . " I said , " I did too . " He said , " No , you didn 't ! " He jumped up on the side of the pool , got into a racing dive . He said , " All right , we 'll do it again . Twenty laps this time . " I was ... I was so dead I could hardly drag myself out of the water . " All right . You won . You won . " Tell me , Gillian . How is he ? He 's okay . Okay . Yeah . We 're all gonna be okay . That 's a promise . Peter ! Stop ! Please , let me off ! I 'm supposed to get off here ! Peter ! - What the hell do you think you 're doing ? - You were gonna leave me ! Now , look , you got me here . Now , stay out of this . He 's my son . It 's my fight . My God ! I don 't know who to trust anymore ! Look , that bus 'll take you to Seattle . I paid the driver . You 'll be safe . You can 't leave me ! Get on that bus and stay on it ! Peter . But I can take you to him now . Peter , I was lying before . Robin 's not okay . He needs us now ! Look , it 's too dangerous . People around me get killed . Well , damn it ! People around me get hurt too ! I make them bleed ! Robin can help me ! Please . Oh , Jesus ! Why did you do that ? You know I don 't like it when you smell like this stuff , don 't you ? Could you just leave me alone for a little bit , please , Robin ? I got tired of waiting for you ! What 's taking so long ? I wanted to have a bath and a little privacy . Well , you 're taking too goddamn long ! Is everything all right , Dr. Charles ? Yes , everything 's fine . Now , when the others arrive , would you just hold them downstairs for a moment ? I need a few minutes in here , okay ? I 'll call you . Thank you . Robin ? I 'm sorry . Try to understand the strain I 'm under . I 'm very worried about you . Don 't be sorry . I didn 't mean to act like that in there . It 's me . I 'm okay now , though . - I 'm okay . - Good . Well , I 'm starved . You want to have something to eat ? Sure . Well , this looks great . You know , I 've been thinking , Robin , maybe we should take a couple of days off , get a boat , go up to the lake or something . What do you think ? Why did you do that ? So nobody could get in . What 's the matter , Robin ? You know what 's the matter . No , I don 't . What is it ? It 's that goddamn girl ! What girl ? The one that 's like me . What do you mean , " like you " ? What ? You think I don 't know she 's around ? She 's right out there . - There is no girl . - That 's a lie ! No , it isn 't , Robin . She 'll do everything I can do , won 't she ? And you won 't miss me at all . What are you trying to say , Robin ? Company 's coming . Yes , you know that . There 'll be you ... and me ... and Dr. Ives ... and Childress . And that girl makes five . No , only four , Robin . You can see that the table is set just for four . That 's right . I won 't be here . I 'll be dead . That girl 's taking my place after you poison me ! - What 's the matter , Susie ? - Oh , God ! - What 's the matter ? - Oh , God ! Remember ? I told you I didn 't have to touch you to hurt you . Robin , please , stop ! Well , I 'm hurting you now ! Stop it ! 'Cause I don 't love you anymore ! I 'm tired of you ! You 're killing her ! Stop it ! Sto ... Stop . He ... You 're ... kill ... No . Susie , get up . I said , get up . Robin . God , stop . I can make you get up . Turn around . Up . R-Robin . - Up . - Oh , God , Robin . Up . Oh , Rob ... Oh , please . Turn around . Again . Faster . Faster . Faster . Faster . Turn . Again . Turn . Faster . Faster . Let 's do it . Here . Give me your hand . Oh , geez ! Hi , pal . Thought I 'd drop by to say hello . Long time no see , Looking good . Too bad , Peter . You almost made it . Where 's my son ? Why don 't you give up ? Why , you ... - Oh , God ! - Shit ! No ! - Stop ! - Hey ! Stop ! All right , Peter . You said you wanted to see your son . Go ahead and get him . Robin ? Can you hear me ? Robin ? Please answer me . Oh , my God . Robin ! Where is he ? What have they done to you ? Son ? I know they told you I was dead . They wanted me out of the way . I never gave up . I kept looking for you all the time . Come on , Robin . Hey . Don 't you recognize your old man ? Peter ! No ! Hang on , Robin . Reach up with your other hand . Come on . Grab ahold of my jacket . Climb over me . That 's it . Come on . You can do it . That 's it . That 's it . No ! Oh , God ! Robin ! All right . Get ' em out of here . Get ' em out of my sight . Morning . I made some coffee . Would you like some ? No ? It 's warmer by the fire . How did you sleep ? Okay ? I was here most of the night . I-I guess you don 't remember . Move a little closer to the fire . I know what you 've been going through these past couple of days . I know how exhausted you must be . It 'll take more than one night 's sleep . I know how I feel . Peter was my friend . Maybe the best friend I 'll ever have . But I had to do what I did . You saw what happened . Peter could have saved Robin . Instead , he let him go . He deliberately killed his son . I hope you don 't judge me too harshly . I can 't say what I did was right or wrong . I only know I acted , and it 's done . Robin is gone . Peter is gone . And you 're the only one who matters now . Yes , I know that hurts . That hurts so bad , you want to lie down and die , but you have to survive . You 're a healthy , strong , young girl , and you must survive . You 'll begin by putting all the tragedies behind you . I think that 'll be easier if you accept my help . All the bad things you heard about me just aren 't true . I 'm not a bad man . All I want is for you to trust me . Time will take care of the hurting . That 's the simple truth . Tears are good . Don 't be afraid of crying . Tears are just what we need right now . I 'll be a good father to you , Gillian . You can depend on that . Gillian ! Where are you ? Come on ! Come on ! God ! You go to hell . Oh , God ! No ! No !

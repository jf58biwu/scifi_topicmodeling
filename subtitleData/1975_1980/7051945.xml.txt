 - Doctor ? - He 'll be all right . All right , now tell me what happened here . We were helping Mateo with his experiment . What equipment were you using ? The transmitter . Victor , check it out . I warned him . I-I-I warned him repeatedly . You had no right to interfere . You could have killed him . I will not tolerate these experiments in my ... Calm down . Tell me exactly what happened . Commander , I told Mateo his experiments were dangerous . Dangerous , how ? Well , look what 's happened to him . Something did happen . He went into a sort of trance . See , Commander ? I did warn him ! Warren , please . What kind of a trance ? It WAS all quite scientific . Yes , Paul ? 'Drop in temperature recorded in all Alpha sections . ' - Did you trace the source ? - ' We don 't know what caused it , 'but it originated in the section you 're in . ' John . I want the four of you to fill out full reports right away . Yes , Commander . The equipment 's fine . There 's no equipment here that could cause a drop in temperature . Something caused it , Victor . And it started here . It 's OK . - How long have I been out ? - Not long . Do you remember what happened ? Mateo believes we have an innate affinity with plants . Even the possibility of communicating with them . Yes . His work 's based on sound scientific principles . Both human beings and plants have nervous systems . We both respond to pain , hunger . Even happiness . Let 's say he 's convinced that certain wave patterns of the human brain correspond precisely with wave patterns plants send out . Yes . And what Mateo was trying to do in tonight 's experiment was to tap those human wave patterns at source , boost them by using the combined mental powers of his friends , project them and then measure the results . All leading to the ultimate goal of communication between human beings and plants . So what went wrong ? Could that experiment have caused what happened on Alpha ? I can 't see how . Victor , that computer didn 't imagine that drop in temperature . This was the first time I used the mental resources of other people . I felt the difference immediately . A feeling that ... something unusual would happen . Our concentration deepened . I was aware of a new feeling . A coldness seemed to grow inside my mind , my body . With it came fear . A part of my mind struggled ... wanted , tried to resist . Then ... pain . Burning , intense pain . Then nothing You 're probing into areas of the mind we know little about . Of course , that 's what makes it so fascinating . We need a new way , Doctor . A new direction . And I am convinced we are on the right track . You should be careful , then . You seem to be susceptible to psychic phenomenon ... Oh ! Laura , I 'm sorry . - How is he ? - Oh , he 'll be fine . I will keep him in the medical centre tonight . He needs a good night 's sleep . Hi . Hi , yourself . Mateo ... Warren 's stopping your experiments . Warren ! He doesn 't even understand what I 'm trying to do . He thinks it 's too dangerous to go on . It is ... to him . If it succeeds he 'll be as much use around here as a gardener . I think you should stop them too . - Ridiculous . - I 'm serious ! I was there . I saw . I felt what happened . I thought you , at least , understood . I 'm scared , Mateo . Well ? We 've checked . There 's been no reoccurrence anywhere on Alpha . Whatever happened was sudden and swift . Kano ? Computer cannot trace the disturbance source . It tells us everything else except that . I will NOT give up my work , not now . Not for anybody . Not for anybody , for yourself . Why are you so stubborn ? If you won 't help me , I 'll do it alone . Time for your nightcap . We could all do with a good night 's sleep . Just relax . OK , now . Sleep well . Good night . Mateo ... is that you ? Mateo ? No ! No . Mateo 's still under sedation . We 've searched the whole section , there 's no one in here . All right , stand down . - Give me a few minutes . - Sure . Nurse . Helena , there were only two people in this area , you and Mateo . And he was in a drugged sleep . You 're sure about what you saw ? I don 't know , I 'm not sure of anything any more . Wait a minute , I ... I-I am sure about what I ... felt and what I think I saw . Mateo told me certain things that happened to him during his experiment . Feelings of ... coldness and ... dread . And that 's precisely what happened to me just before I ... saw that ... What are you saying ? There was some kind of psychic experience ? All I know is what I felt ... and what I saw . - Well ? Did you check on it ? - ' Yes . ' Computer recorded a temperature drop in the medical area . Identical to the first and still no reason why . Something else , John . Our equipment picked up a strong wave pattern , too . 'The same pattern our friend Mateo uses . 'And very strong . ' Warren , I 'm putting a temporary stop to Dr Mateo 's work . A very wise decision , Commander . What are you doing ? This experiment is now finished . There 's more important work for Mateo to do ... for all of you to do . - Leave it , I 'll do it . - Uh ? Don 't worry . I said I 'll do it . All right . I want a 24-hour check on temperature levels , inform me of any drop . Commander , what are we looking for ? I wish I knew . I 'm not going to let him do this . It 's just for the time being . I 've heard that before , too . Look , Doctor . We are living out here in space , living on borrowed time . If any one of our essential support systems fail ... maybe we survive . But if our food chain goes , we are finished . My work is important . Because I know I can increase the margin of survival . Mateo , it was Commander Koenig 's decision . Yes , with a big push from Warren . Well , we 'll see . Mateo ? - Warren ! - Mateo ! Get out , Mateo . I don 't want you in my department . I 'll kill you if you say another word . - Mateo ! - You saw that . You were a witness . Commander , temperature drop registering . Source unidentified . Hydroponic unit . Alan . Warren . Warren . Who 's there ? Who are you ? Who is it ? Commander , I wasn 't even in here when he died . I couldn 't stand the man , but kill him ? Mateo , no one is accusing you . But you did quarrel with the man and minutes later he was dead . Will you excuse us ? Please ? Three times we experienced temperature drops , each time something strange happened . First , you had some kind of mental attack . Then Dr Russell is terrorised by an Alphan who doesn 't exist . And now ... this . Nothing like this happened on Alpha before your experiment . - Yes ... - Mateo . We 've recorded the wave pattern you used in your experiment . That 's impossible . Your equipment cannot record that wave pattern . - It 's so slight it hardly exists . - We did . It was recorded when the temperature dropped , including when Warren died . And how do you record psychic energy ? A very rare and very powerful source of psychic energy . Psychic energy Because that 's what we 've got , John . Right here on Alpha . Totally shattered spinal column . I 've never seen anything like it . Fear generated to an unimaginable intensity . Are you positive no person could have caused this ? A blow of some kind ? No blow could have caused this , John . Paul , command conference . You want us to believe that Alpha is being terrorised by some kind of ... psychic being ? A spook ? Call it what you like , Alan . What it adds up to is a destructive force that has killed and may do so again . Commander , most of us here are scientists , rational human beings . We believe in the laws of cause and effect . What happened to Warren was an effect , but can we really accept that the cause was supernatural ? Yes , but Paul , we all know that human beings use no more than about 18 % of their actual brain potential . What happens in that other 82 % is anybody 's guess . So you reject the idea that these events are supernatural ? Supernatural , yes ... paranormal , no . What we 're talking about is a wave pattern that 's created by electrical activity and originates in the most primitive , least understood area of the brain . We do know that people that have psychic powers have this wave pattern in greater strength than others and that something happened in Mateo 's experiment which boosted this wave pattern to a previously unknown intensity . Does it matter what it is or where it came from ? The important thing is that it is here , amongst us . Mateo , you 're deliberately disobeying orders . I know what I 'm doing . You 're destroying everything you 've worked for . You don 't understand . Warren was right . Your experiment is too dangerous and you must stop it now . - Listen to me ... Listen to me ... - No . ... carefully , Laura . It 's possible something did happen in here . If Bergman did record that wave pattern , then we 're on the verge of some tremendous breakthrough . How ... How it happened , I don 't know . But don 't you see I must pursue it ? All I see is that I 'm frightened . Well , don 't be frightened . I must try to recreate what happened , to locate and identify this force if it exists . Don 't you see ? No . But it 's the only way we can understand what 's happening here . Give it to me . No . Give it to me . No . No . OK , then I shall have to tell Commander Koenig . Get out of here . But it 's an esoteric supposition . Hold it , we 're not getting anywhere . The simple fact is ... 'Hydroponics , temperature drop . ' She died the same way as Warren . It 's my fault . It 's my fault . I wouldn 't listen and now she 's dead and I did it . - Do you hear ? - Mateo . This thing on Alpha , it 's my fault . It is my fault , I raised it . It 's not a question of whose ... It 's ... It 's here now . In this place . It 's waiting to kill again . To kill us ... all . Mateo . Mateo , come with me . Come on . Come on . Ever since the experiment ... I 've known . I 've sensed this thing . A presence . I tried to convince myself ... I was mistaken . That I imagined it . But no . It is with me everywhere I go . Watching . Waiting for something . You know I threatened to kill Warren ? You are not responsible for Warren 's death . But ... he died only minutes after I threatened him . And Laura ? Take it easy . It 's all right . Just take it easy . She was going to tell the Commander ... I was trying to recreate the experiment . I tried to stop her . She wouldn 't listen . A few minutes ... later ... she was dead . This force has some bizarre connection with Mateo . As he understands it , it 's seizing on the destructive urges within him and carrying them out . What do you think ? John , I 've seen this ... being . I believe it . Mateo wants to try the experiment again to bring it out into the open . - It could be dangerous . - Let him , John . Let him recreate the experiment . My concern is for the safety of Alpha . But we can 't fight this thing unless we know what it is . I say let him . And give him all the help we can . Everybody put it on their right wrist . I 've told you what to do . Please follow my instructions and do not break the circle . Now ... concentrate . John ... That 's it , that 's what I saw . - Bergman ! - Don 't break the circle ! Mateo ? I was once who you say . What do you want ? Mateo lives , he is one of us . You have no existence here . You took my existence from me . Your legacy . Witness the result of your actions . Your presence here is an accident . No accident . I have returned . My being cries out for vengeance . For the collective act which destroyed my existence . No . NO ! Well ? He 's in deep shock . Of course , he 's under heavy sedation . What I 'm concerned about is what happens when it wears off . When full awareness returns . Whether we believe in the occult or not , there is a tradition in our culture of ghosts , spirits ... some force which continues to work after death . Coming back in search of revenge or justice or whatever . But this thing that Mateo has summoned up is coming back to avenge a terrible death . Its own death . Which has not happened yet . Right now it draws its existence from Mateo . And it 's capable of carrying out his aggressive urges . The present danger is restricted to just that . What if it gets stronger , starts acting independently against us ? Aren 't we getting ahead of ourselves ? Surely we just sedate him until we find a solution ? No , Victor . Sedation will not keep his unconscious from operating . Helena 's experience occurred while he was under sedation . Yeah . So , how do we deal with it ? How ? Of course , there is the traditional way of dealing with demons and spirits and such . You mean ... bell , book and candle ... exorcism ? Yes , that and the use of occult symbols like the pentagram is one way . But what I 've got in mind is an extension of those techniques . Now , this being has power , it has energy . And we know where that energy originates . It has a structure . So what we 've got to do is determine what that structure is and then maybe ... just maybe ... we can deal with it . Mezadrine ? That will bring out the most violent , aggressive responses . Exactly . That 's just why we have to try it . If we can summon this creature in a time and place of our choosing , we might just be able to contain it . It should work , but ... it could destroy him . Yeah , I know . That has to be my responsibility . Paul , withdraw all personnel from Alpha Section 5 . Restrict access to everyone except Dr Russell , Professor Bergman , Dr Mathias and myself . - Is he ready ? - About . The area within those four terminals is lethal . So whatever happens , nobody go in there . Ready . What is this ? What are you doing to me ? Let me go , Commander . Doctor , do you hear ? Do you hear me ? Let me go . If those straps don 't hold , he 'll harm himself . Helena , we 've got to go through with it . Do you hear ? Let me go . You will pay for this . All of you . Let me out . I 'll kill you , Koenig . Koenig ! Koenig ! Koenig ! Koenig ! Koenig . Let me out of here . No ! Leave him alone ! Leave him alone ! Kill Koenig . You mustn 't blame yourself , John . Every death on this base is personal to me , Helena . But Mateo ... I feel his just that little bit more . Mateo was burned in precisely the same way as the spirit we saw . It was inevitable he 'd die like that . It was preordained . He was beyond our kind of help . I just can 't get it out of my mind . I mean , life after death - maybe , maybe not . But to be haunted by your own ghost even before you die ? What 's that all about ? Life and death - still the big questions , the greatest mysteries .

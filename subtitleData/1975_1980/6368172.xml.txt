 After the disasters , it was as if life itself , it already stopped . Everything burned . Afterwards , nothing seemed to grow again . Nothing . The cities died . People looted them and ran to the sea . But the seas had died too . Empty ... And then , it rained again . But the land and the people were still barren . People died of hunger and disease , and hopelessness . And the strong ones began killing the weak ones for scraps of food . Those who could , flocked together in tribes and hid in caves and secret places . And others became like wolves , hunting and killing anything that moved . They were ravagers . Falk ! Oh ! Miriam . Miriam . Mmm . I heard a gunshot . Did you see Ravagers ? Falk ? Well , I heard ... I ... Thought I heard something . But it was in the hills . Probably some scouts . Come on . I really think it 's time that we moved on , Miriam . You get him , she 's yours . What have you done ? I put the bed over there and I put the table over there . - Do you like it ? - Yeah . I like it . All right , okay , they 're up there somewhere . Spread out . You two go around the back . It 's good . Good . - Falk ... - Yeah , Miriam . I , uh , I found something today . See ? Isn 't it beautiful ? Miriam ... Wha ... What ? Listen , it 's dry . There 's nothing . - Nothing . - No . Hey ... It 'll be all right.It 's all right . I told you not toprowl around out there . That 's my job . Understand ? Good . Where will we go ? Well , uh , south . - Yeah . - Well , won 't they be going south , too ? Following the Flocker tribes ? Well , uh , yes , but , uh ... We 've always managed to keep ahead of them before . I was just beginning to feel safe here . Yeah . Well , that 's when you start going careless . Falk , can we go back to that place on the beach ? Beach ? Why ? Maybe the fish would come back . Oh ! I told you , please , it 's no use . The seas are poisoned . They 're poisoned . There has to be somewhere . Must be somewhere . A place where there 's children . Come on ! Falk , hurry . Get him ! I kill ! Go up the tower . Hurry . Come on . The bridge . Let 's go . Cross the bridge . Kill him ! Kill him ! Go around there . Miriam . Miriam . Miriam ! Miriam ! Miriam ! Miriam ! Miriam ... Someday it will happen again . A woman somewhere will have a child . No , Miriam . Look what I found . Look at this , look at this . Give me a kiss , honey . Don 't get wet now . Boy fromthe steel mill . We looked all over.He 's long gone . He 's out there somewhere . There 's nobody alive out there . I 'll find him . Move out ! Can we go back to that place on the beach ? Maybe the fish have come back . It 's a place called Genesis . A place where things still grow . It means something , Falk . All the wayto the Appellate Court . Don 't think you can get away with this . I 'll teach you how the system works . Don 't think you can avoid appeals . Costs be damned ... I won 't lose this . No , no ... I 'm onmy way , sir.Just on my way . I ... I 'm not going to hurt you I won 't hurt you . I don 'tknow you , sir . Oh , I 'm ... I 'm just a guylooking for some food .

Sergeant , you are a hard man to lose . I want to give you warning , Sir . Burned . Could be crawlingwith ravagers . All around . Keep an eye out . Only way to make sure . Only way . You 're raving , Sergeant . This place is as safe as any other . If they burned it , it was a long time ago . So you forget about it . - Now go back where you belong . - All right . I 'll keep a sharp eye outfor any moving lights . Sergeant ! What the hell you doing ? I heard somebody out there . Follow me . Sergeant , get down , get down . They 're out there , Sir . Do you hear ' em ? Sergeant , back ! Get back ! There 's one ! Take him ! All right . I 've been following you since yesterday . - What the hell for ? - Well , why the helldo you think ? Welcome to the post , ma 'am . Sir . Here 's the watch list for the Major 's approval . We 're a little short of personnel , but I think we can manage , Sir . Your bath is ready , Sir . Me first . Sergeant . Yes , Sir . Isn 't there , uh ... Isn 't there anything you can remember ? I remember many casualties , Sir . The Major having to operate the bulldozer . Digging a mass grave . Sergeant , that wasn 't me . That was a grim task , Major . Well , maybe it was your Major that you buried in the grave . You were very ill , Sir . Sergeant , I was six years old then . Don 't you understand anything ? Falk ... What ? I can 't go back to my people . Why ? Once you leave , you can 't go back . They kill you . Now listen to me . I ... I don 't want you dead . I just want you gone . You understand ? Now ... Tomorrow you 're going . You , him . Tomorrow , Sir , drop her off at the nearest Civil Defense Center . Let me give him one . Ask him again . He ain 't gonna be doin ' much talkin ' . Nobody is following us . I 'll find you some shelter , then we 're splitting up . Let 's go . All secure , Sir . All right , let 's get us some sleep . Sergeant ... I 'll show youto your quarters , Miss ? Look what I found . You 'll forget her . Leave me alone , please . No ! Look , what I 've been trying to tell you all along ... Faina . Say my name . Faina . Faina . Faina . All right ? Faina . You don 't like to be teased , do you ? I told you I was a loner . There 's no room in my life for another woman . One was enough . You couldn 't love her that much . Take that damn dress off . No . Take the dress off ! - No ! - Take it off ! Take it off ! Look , there 's no room in my life for anybody . Do you understand ? Now please , leave me alone . No . Faina , please , please , listen to me . I 'm made all wrong for this . I 'm not what you think I am . I 'm not what I seem to be . I 'm good for you , you 'll see . What makes you so goddamn stubborn ? When my older sister died , she dug her nailsinto the back of my handuntil I cried . She said the painwould make me remember . Remember what ? Never to be afraid . And never , never to be ashamed . Leave that up . Hurry . I 'll cover you from the other side . Looks like there 's nobody here . Candle wax . Behind you ! Move out , Major . Move out . Come on . Sergeant ! Go on , I 'll catch up with ya . You 're gonna get it , you lousy bastards ! Come on , you ... What is it ? Nothin ' . I mean ... He was just a crazy old fool , wasn 't he ? We couldn 't have saved him . It wasn 't your fault , you know . I guess . We gotta keep moving . Come on . Come on . Turn the old man loose . Falk . Careful , now . Ravagers ? No . Easy ... No , they 're not . Give you a handwith this here . Easy ... Don 't move . Please . I don 't want to hurt you . Just want to talk . Who are you ? You look fed.You 've got new clothes . You look like peopleused to look ... Long ago . Are you people from Genesis ? Hand over that weapon and we 'll talk . Come on . We 're going with you . So , come on . Major ! My God ! It 's the Sergeant . Major . Help him , Faina . Hold up there . - A little scratch . - Hold up . Let 's go ! My God ! Heave away . Hey , steady . Oh , look at all this . These ships . How did you people find them ? Find them ? No , it wasn 't like that . Rann brought us here with the ships a long time ago . - Oh , my God.-Yeah. - Look , they keep bringing more things . - Yeah . Where 's it coming from ? This is just the storeroom . The other ship is full of supplies . 50 years worth . We could live like this for 50 years . In hiding Rann says . Who , who ... Who 's Rann ? Rann is Rann . Oh . When you change , I want to show you something . It 's real . It works . How ? We have a generator . Lots of diesel fuel . Oh . The last time I saw electric lights I , uh ... Why , I was a kid . Lots of comforts . We almost have everything . Come with me . Come on , you can see all of this later . Hey . Can I talk to you ? Look . Look , you show me marvels . Food ... Uh ... Uh , electric lights . Uh , things that , uh ... I mean , you show me things that nobody else in the world has . Yet , you 're trying to tell me that something is wrong about it . Now what is it ? Come on , what is it ? Well ... Yeah . You and that girl was going someplace . Where ? Nowhere . Anywhere.What the hell differencedoes it make ? Genesis . Oh , God , that Genesis again . The girl , we all heard her . You know where it is . Look , there 's no such place . And even if there was , I mean , uh , why would anybodywant to leave all this ? Yeah . Uh-huh . Yeah , you 're cautious . Fair enough . I 'll show you now . Who is it ? Open up . Just be a minute . Brown ! Tell him we are not going to run . Tell him it was all a mistake . Sure . Sure , I 'll tell him . He listens to you , doesn 't he ? No . No ? What are they alldoing in there ? They want to leave the ship . Rann says no . Nobody leaves . Bring up the small boat . Hey . Watch it . They 're somewhere behind that island . Over here . Move ! Come on . Move it ! Is that Rann ? We done it before . I remember how my dad ... His name is Falk . - MAN : Ah . Pass me the bread . Ever think you 'd see anything like this , Falk ? Not ever . Never . And I 've seen a Flocker 's camp before . We 're not Flocker 's here . I guess I spoke out of turn . Yes , you did . I 'll accept your apology . You did apologize ? Oh , yes.Oh , yes . Sure . I 'm sorry. - How come you 've seen so many Flocker camps , Falk ? Huh ? What does it matter ? I mean , maybe you 're not Flockers and you should think you 're better off than them , and in some respects you are . You see , what , what I mean is , there 's no real difference . They hide . And you hide . They 're afraid of strangers , you 're afraid of strangers . Hold on , Falk . You 're getting out of line . Hold it , hold it , hold it . Now let him saywhat he thinks . Um , if you had todecide for us , what would you do ? Speak up . We 're interested in your opinion . Well ... It seems to me that hiding in fear is not the answer . There may be something better out there . But you 'll never know it . Not if you stay here , locked and caged up , just waitingfor everything to end . You 've , uh , you 've got to take a chance . And gamble awayall our lives , in the hope that there 's something better out there ? Why ? We have everything we need right here . - MAN : Yeah , we sure do . Except hope . Well , now ... Well , look around you , Falk . Isn 't this better than ... Huh . It can 't be . It ... It 's real . Caught this morning . We get ' em right here.In the channel . The fish , yeah , returned . They 're showing upmore and more . Maybe it 's a sign . Damn it , Hank , that 's enough ! Now , once and for all , I say the land is finished . Maybe not , Rann ! Now look , maybe not . If the fishhave come back , that means the seas are not poisoned . So why can 't the land come back ? Look , when I was in a Flocker 's camp , I met an old man . He gave me an apple . He gave me two apples . Two . New , ripe apples . Doesn 't that mean something to you people ? Well , doesn 't it ? Somewhere things are beginning to grow again . Maybe children . Children are beginning to ... To ... To be born once more . Can 't you see that ? Well , can 't you ? It 's settled . Nobody leaves this ship . You mean that I am a prisoner here , too ? Prisoner ? Huh . You can do anything you want . As long as it doesn 't jeopardize the rest of us . Well , I can live by anything then . That makes sense . Good . Good , I 'm glad to hear it . Because our rulesmake a lot of sense.Hmm ? - Right ? Oh , by the way , are you with him ? - No . - Yes . No . Yes. - No , she 's not . She doesn 't know . There seems to be a difference of opinion . Now you see , this is where our rules come in very handy . A good-looking unattached woman can be a threat to the peaceof the community . Now , we 're not telling youwho to choose , but you 've got to choosesomebody . Him . Aha . Done ! You 're married . A toast to the Major and his lady . Good luck to both of you in married quarters , Sir . To the Major . This calls for a celebration . Bring out the whiskey . Oh , plug in the jukebox . Hey , Falk , they 're all dancing back there . Come on . Don 't you ever dance ? You 're laughing . See , you like being married . Admit it . My God . - What makes you so damn ... - Stubborn ? I told you . I 'm good for you . Come on . Let 's go back to the music . Falk ! What do you want ? We want to talk to you . What ? We want to know about Genesis . Where is it ? I don 't know . I thought this was it . But I was wrong . Come on , you can trust us . You heard what the man said . He 'll never let you leave this ship . What if he can 't stop us ? We 've got others . Will you lead us ? Admiral , it was amazing . They had me . I mean , they really had me . Then the stupidbastards cut meloose up there . They cut you loose ? - Ravagers ! - Let 's go , let 's go , come on ! Follow me to the Armory . Move , come on , move it . Brown , get some men , get up topside and see if you can hold ' em off . Okay . Come on ! Here you go . I 'm here , Major . I 'll cover you , Sir . We 're finished . We gotta get off this thing . There 's a hatchway where they brought water through . Do you remember ? I remember . How do we find it ? Follow me , Sir . Go on , Sergeant , get out of here . Take her with you . Brown , where do we go ? Through the doorway . Look out ! Genesis ? Well , I guess we 're it . Come on !

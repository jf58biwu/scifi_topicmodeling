 It 's somehow beautiful . It 's a perfect machine . Born to dance amongst the stars . It 's bumping into them that has me worried . Why did you volunteer , Starbuck ? Well , somebody had to do it . Did Apollo make you ? Yes , you certainly have a way of cutting through the felgercarb . Do you ever take that smouldering weed out of your mouth ? I had this wonderful speech all prepared . About this being your last night here , about possibly not seeing another night as beautiful as this one or another girl as beautiful as I am ever again ? That speech is a little better than the one I had . Would you mind if I borrowed it on some future occasion ? Do you mind if we don 't spend much more time in the launching bay ? Can you think of any place more private ? I can 't think of any place private in the whole damn fleet . - What 's in there ? - That 's the launch tube . You don 't want to go in there . It 's dark and cold and ... Lord , I 'll do anything you ask tomorrow , just don 't call an alert tonight . Colonel , have you seen Lieutenant Starbuck ? No , I don 't think I ... Wait , I did see him on the monitors earlier . Before we shut down , he was checking out his ship . - That seems to make sense . - I 'm sure he 's gone . Getting a good night 's sleep for the mission . Why don 't you do the same ? That little snake . The Nova of Madagon is not a nova at all but a star field so bright our cockpits will be sealed to prevent blindness . We 'll navigate by scanner and clear a path with turbo lasers . Starbuck ? You 're fidgeting like a daggit on a sunspot . It 's my bio-pulse line , sir . It 's a bad time for me to be in a cockpit . Starbuck 's being polite . He got a steam burn . I won 't ask you how you got it because I need you on this mission . I didn 't choose you to help without a great deal of anguish . Let me assure you that if we fail , no one will survive . The rest of our friends must sit in anticipation of our skill . Or lack thereof . - Ready ? - Ready . Radiation shield positive . Launch fighters now . 'Skin temperature read-out 100 and rising . ' I can 't see anything but it 's getting hot . Anybody picking up the field ? - Negative . - ' Mine 's gone . ' 'I was afraid of that . It 's too bright . ' Core systems transferring control to Galactica . 'We will guide you using scanners . ' - What if we miss a mine ? - We 'll be the first to know . Let 's go . 'We 'll talk you through . ' 'Countdown to fire . 'Five , four , three ... ' 'Three degrees right . 'Target destroyed . One target coming up . ' 'It 's burning through . ' ' .. two , one , fire . ' 'Keep firing ! ' 'And fire . 'Heartbeat , Captain Boomer , read-out 100 , other functions normal . ' It 's working , Commander . They 're clearing a path 100 maxims wide . That is precision flying . - I can 't see . Are we hitting anything ? - Hanged if I know . ' .. two , one , fire . 'Heartbeat , Captain Apollo , read-out 99 . 'Skin temperature 120 and still rising . 'Skin temperature 130 and rising . - ' Five , four ... ' - ' It 's getting hot . ' ' .. two , one , fire . 'Fire . 'Fire . 'Heartbeat , Captain Apollo , read-out 99 . 'Skin temperature 135 and slowly levelling off . ' It 's cooling off . Let 's take a look at where we are . Negative shield , now . There it is - Carillon . - I think we 're going to make it . - Yee-ha ! We did it ! Recall the flight crews . 'The planet Carillon . ' Landing operations will begin at once . Prepare to land the mineral ships and the landram parties . 'Our mineral scanners have located 'the approximate site of the old mining expedition . 'Blue Squadron will vector in the ground search teams . ' Welcome , Baltar . I have grave news . A handful of Colonials prevail but we will soon find them . What of our bargain ? My colony was to be spared ! I now alter the bargain . How can you change one side of a bargain ? When there is no other side . You have missed the entire point of the war . But I have no ambitions against you . Could you think me so foolish as to trust a man who would see his own race destroyed ? Not destroyed , subjugated . Under me . There can be no survivors . So long as one human remains alive the alliance is threatened . Surely you ... You don 't mean me ? We thank you for your help , Baltar . Your time is at an end . - No , you can 't ... - No , not now , Centurion . Remove him for public execution . Vector 63038 to Ground Expedition 2 . 'My scanners read life forms beyond here . ' Either it 's some high-energy substance or they left a caretaker operation behind . 'We 've got it , 038 . Thanks . ' I wonder what this looks like in the daytime . Hey , this is the daytime . Oh . Lovely . 'Skywalk 038 , can you assist in locating Tylium mine ? ' You got it , Captain . My scanner indicates that you will intersect the mine area in 24 millicentons . 'Affirmative . ' 'Sync chronometers . ' Captain would like a check-in every four millicentons . - ' Understood ? ' - Affirmative , Jolly . You are in time-sync now . 038 returning to base . See you guys in a while . Good luck . Boomer ... - Yeah , yeah , what is it now ? - You 're not going to believe this . I don 't believe it . - What is it ? - I don 't know . - Boy , it sure is pretty . - Yeah . - Sounds friendly . - Yeah . Don 't shoot me ! What do you want ? Wait , wait . Don 't be afraid . Listen ... Hey , you 're from Taura . I 'm a Taurus . How do you know that ? The dialect . Listen , what is this place ? - What are you doing here ? - Me ? What are you doing here ? Colonial warriors sneaking around with your weapons drawn ! - Sorry . - This is legal , isn 't it ? Well , how did you get here ? - I came in a skybus . - She 's been smoking plant vapour . Wait , wait , miss ! Could you tell us something about this bus ? My travelator , he took care of all of it . Isn 't it fabulous here ? All this for so little money . Oh , and I just won over 1,000 cubits . - Isn 't that amazing ? - You won those cubits here ? In here . Everybody 's doing it . It 's incredible . If it 's illegal , you 're going to have to fight the whole star system . I have to go . I have a moonlight cruise . Two moons - oh , how can you go wrong ? How cut off can these people be ? It 's like she hasn 't heard the Colonies were destroyed . And why haven 't we heard about this place ? I suppose you know every gambling chancery in this star system ? That 's right . If there 's a game going on , you 'd know about it . The odds must be incredible . People are winning a fortune . Yes , and they 're well fed . Why don 't we find out who 's in charge of this place and get some food to the fleet ? The last thing these people may want is a battlestar at their front door . I 've never found a gambling den that didn 't depend on military pay vouchers . Now , Boomer , until we find out who these , er , people are , remember , it only takes one informant and the Cylon war machine will be here . I want to look around , sit in on a game , see if I can find out what 's behind this place . Your mission , Boxey , is to watch that read-out . When the counter gets to ten , it means we 've found a Tylium deposit . Yes , sir . We can 't afford to stay in one place for too long . Why ? Why 'd those people want to hurt us ? What did we do to them ? It 's not what we did to them , it 's what they fear we could do . They 're not like us . They 're machines , created by living creatures a long time ago . If they 're machines , why don 't we just turn ' em off ? Boy , I wish we could . These machines aren 't that simple . Some machines are so advanced they function better than living creatures . - They 're not smarter . - In some ways , they are . They think a lot faster than we do but they 're not as individual . We can do more of the unexpected . It 's about the only advantage we have . - Why did we make them ? - We didn 't . Another race did . A race of reptiles called Cylons . The Cylons found humans were the most practical creatures in this system , so they copied our bodies but they built them bigger and stronger . They can exchange parts and live forever . Maybe the Cylons who created these machines could turn them off . There are no more real Cylons . They died off thousands of yahrens ago , leaving behind a race of supermachines . And we still call them Cylons . Will that happen to us , too ? Will our machines take over ? We are very careful not to make our drones that intelligent or independent . Present company excepted , Muffit . I think we 'd better have this drone checked . He 's been listening awfully closely . - We 'd better talk . - Right . ? Something 's always after you ? It 's love ? Love , love ? It 's love ? Love , love ♪ It 's love ♪ Love , love ... ♪ - They can 't try to read our lips in here . - Who ? Whoever might be up to something here . Well , Boomer , one thing this place isn 't is crooked . - Where 'd you get all those cubits ? - Gambling . You can 't lose . That 's what I mean . You ever been in a chancery where you couldn 't lose ? No , but then I 've never been here either . ? No matter where you go ? It won 't matter what you do ♪ Cos something 's always after you ... ♪ We could make a fortune if we put those girls on the star circuit . - I mean big money . Big money . - Big money ? Mm ! Every creature in the universe is out to exterminate us - and you want to hire a vocal group ? - Mm-hm . Starbuck , there 's something not right about this place . ? It 's love ? Love , love ? It 's love ? Love , love ? It 's love ? Love , love ? Love ! Love ! ♪ Love ♪ I 've got to talk to those girls . Quiet , Muffit . I see it . Tylium . Nice going . That 's a hot reading . We may be right on top of that old mine . I better check it out . OK , Jolly , keep your eyes open . - I 'll bring him back . - Hey , Boxey . Boxey , hold it right here . I 'm going to get him back . Muffy ! Muffy ! Thank you . - For what ? - For saving my son 's life . You 're getting things out of proportion . Anyway , maybe I should thank you . You don 't know me or about Boxey 's father . When you 're ready you 'll tell me . Nothing that 's gone on before really counts for much . As far as the human race is concerned we 're all starting over . Muffy ! Muffy ? ! Muffy ! Muffy ? Muffy ! Darn you , daggit ! Where are you ? Muffy ! Muffy ? ! Muffy ! Muffy ? ! - Any sign of Boxey ? - Afraid not . What is it ? - What 's happening on this planet ? - I don 't know . This is the largest Tylium mine I 've seen . I just want to find Boxey . 'Welcome to Carillon . 'You are impressed ? ' Confused is more like it . We 've lost a little boy . 'He is safe . We found him and brought him here . - ' Would you care to join him ? ' - Yes , we would . Mommy ! Ah ... Captain . Good fortune smiles on us . It 's like nothing we dreamed of , Captain . They have everything we need . They 're happy to share . - Sounds like paradise . - Yeah , it does . Colonel ? A message from Sire Uri . Well , Colonel . - A most optimistic note . - Too optimistic . Uri has everyone breaking in the bulkheads to get there . Perhaps in small numbers in rotation . It isn 't going to be that way . He 's authorised visitors ' permits to half our population . Half the population ? 'We 've come so far , so quickly , 'there has been little time for reason . 'What is the secret behind the existence of this outpost 'on the outer rim of our star system ? 'There are many such oases for intergalactic travellers , 'but none so far off the known arteries of trade , 'and none so curiously close to a Tylium mine . ' Fuel has begun to arrive from the Ovion mines but in curiously small quantities . Now I feel the growing need for extraordinary measures of precaution . 'The ships continue to hover over the planet , 'supported by maintenance crews 'whose spirits are as depleted as their numbers . ' Everyone seems to have forgotten our flight from the Cylons . The beauty and wiles of Carillon hold our people spellbound . Let ' em ride . Hello , Starbuck . - This is my lucky night . - Just might be . - Well , money isn 't everything . - No ? Have you checked out the accommodations yet ? Most of my unit is staying down on Carillon tonight . - I 'll see what I can arrange . - OK . Yeah . - Are you going to play , sir ? - I hope so . Hm ? Oh ! Yeah , sure . Let ' em ride again . It 's my lucky night . Can 't lose . Is this seat taken ? Oh , er ... Well , it 's , er ... - Starbuck ... - Yeah . I came because I think I owe you an apology . You do ? This paradise is the perfect opportunity for us to be ... open and honest with one another . - Yeah . - I hurt you . Admit it . Well ... You once said I was the only woman you 'd had real feelings toward . Yeah , I , er , may have said that . You may have said that ? No . No , Athena , wait ! What ... What I meant to say is that I 've had to shut all of those feelings out to avoid any more pain than I 've already suffered . Starbuck ... Oh , no ... Hello . Excuse me , you 're occupying my space . - Your space ? - Yes , I have good news . - Hm ? - I got us the key to the royal suite . Why thank you , we do appreciate it . Er , see , listen , I 've got this hot streak going here ... - Oh ! I see . - Yes , I do , too . Well , have a good time , you two . And next time it 's office rates , Lieutenant . Never eaten so much in my entire life . I 'm gonna be as fat as a pig . Push level three for us , please . I feel like a total glut , Nanswah . Nothing fits me any more . And we 've only been on the surface for three ... Erm ... I asked you to push the third level . There , you 've missed our lodging . I did press it . Something seems to be wrong . Well , there are no lodgings this far down . Look there , it seems to be taking us all the way to the bottom . - Something 's happening . - Let me at that control . There , we 've stopped . Thank goodness . I wonder what 's down here . You wanted to see me ? I 've been sitting here for yahrens , it seems , examining our military intelligence on this Carillon outpost . I didn 't think we had any beyond the exploration for fighter fuel . That 's the disquieting part . Baltar 's people declared the Tylium too minimal for mining . And our military intelligence is based on that report . And now we find one of the largest Tylium mines in the star system . Exactly . So the mystery is , who 's behind such a huge remote mining operation ? There 's no local food source to feed their labourers . They must be bringing it in from who knows how far ? They have plenty to share . Our people are getting obese . Yes . And there 's another mystery . There seems to be no connection between the Ovion workers underground and the resort on the surface , and yet there must be some connection . Do you suspect a tie-in with the Cylon Empire ? Where Baltar 's involved I suppose I suspect everything . You 've had no reports of anything odd , out of the ordinary ? No , sir . The people are having the time of their lives . It 's a circus . A wonderland . - Shall we ? - Why don 't we , my beautiful captain ? We have here the food and necessities to feed our people . We have the support of a culture quite content to be subservient to our needs . We are far away from the Cylons so as not to pose a threat to them . At least we ought not to pose a threat . And would not if we destroyed our war machines . - What 's this ? - Ah , our young warrior . Or should I say saviour ? I was just pointing out that the Cylons destroyed our cities because we were a threat to their order . Here , isolated from them , we pose no threat . Or would not , if we disposed of our ships and weapons . Now , what do you think of my proposal ? Hope it 's the grog . Well , tonight it might very well be the grog , but there 's always tomorrow . Why should they believe we are now willing to accept that which we have always found unacceptable - to live under Cylon rule ? Because we would destroy our arms ... to prove we are willing to live in peace . - Destroy our only means of defence ? - Or attack . May I remind my brothers that we did not have conflict with the Cylons until we intervened in their relations with other nations ? Yes . Yes , you are right . We did not come into conflict with the Cylons until we helped our neighbours , whom the Cylons wished to enslave . And until we helped the Hasaris get back their nation , taken by force by the Cylons . Correct , but if we mind our own business , there 's every reason to believe that the Cylons will leave us alone . If you 've all come here to turn your backs on the principles of our fathers and the Lords of Kobol , from whom all Colonies evolved , you do so with my utter contempt . Warriors are always the last to recognise the inevitability of change . We have a choice . Life or death . I submit that an issue this grave should be decided by our people . Maybe you 're right but I 'll tell you , the military won 't be easy to convince . How , may I ask , do you propose to present such a delicate matter ? At a celebration to decorate those three brave young men who led us to safety through the perilous straits of Madagon . One of them Adama 's son , I do believe . Just the tonic our people need at this moment ... some old-fashioned down-to-goodness heroes . - After you . - Thank you . Party 's just getting started . I 'm kind of companied out , thank you . You 'll miss the tribute for the warriors . I 've given them all the tribute they 're going to get . Oh , it missed my level . Mine , too . Something seems to be wrong . We 're going all the way down . Is that allowed ? I wonder what 's down there ? Help me ! What are they doing with us ? OK , 30-70 . You guys split 70 % and I 'll even pick up the transportation . I just don 't think it will work out . Why not ? Look , I can 't talk now . - What do you mean ? - We 'll have to talk about it later , if you 're still around . Wait , where 're you going ? You 're my ticket out of the military . Starbuck ! What are you doing ? The captain 's been looking for you . I agree with you . Something 's going on around here . It 's gonna have to wait . We 're going back to the Galactica . - What for ? - Dress uniforms . Dress uniforms ? I 'm not getting into any fancy ... One does not accept the highest military honour , the Gold Cluster , in a battle suit . - The Gold Cluster ? You 're kidding . - We got it . Commander ? Commander . Just like old times , isn 't it , Tigh ? Our ships weren 't so fancy but we gave them a good run . Yes . You didn 't tell anyone we were meeting ? - No . - Good . Is there some reason why we shouldn 't be talking ? Pick up that ground-crew communicator and climb into the next ship , please . - Climb into the next ship ? - Quickly . You 're patched into my internal comms system . We are completely isolated . No one can hear us . Yes , but why would anyone want to ? It grieves me to take such precautions on our own battlestar . Sire Uri 's men are expecting me to make a move over his disarmament plan . Even my private quarters are being monitored . Now , what I 'm about to propose is somewhat risky . You don 't have to go along if you don 't want to . Commander , if you say we should do it , naturally I say we should do it . What is it we 're about to do ? Tigh , when would be the most devastating time for a Cylon strike ? Almost any time , with half of our warriors down on ... During the celebration , when all of our warriors are down on Carillon . If we were attacked without being able to recall our warriors ... we wouldn 't have a chance . A few well-placed Cylon bombs in the heart of this launching bay ... and we couldn 't get a single fighter into the air . Then you do think there 's more to Carillon than generosity ? It smells like a trap . It feels like a trap . I believe it is a trap . It is imperative that we get our pilots closer to our ships . Or perhaps the other way around - get our ships closer to our pilots . How do we get our ships down to Carillon without council clearance ? We launch a couple at a time as if they were part of our regular patrol . The council has ordered all of our warriors to be at the party . They will be there , in a manner of speaking . Now , Uri doesn 't know all of our warriors on sight . He 'll be counting uniforms , not men . - He 'll be counting uniforms ? - Yes . And I want you to collect all the warrior uniforms you can possibly lay your hands on and fill them with whomever you can find . Mechanics , kitchen personnel , anyone . And get them down to that party . - What do I tell them ? - Tell them anything . Tell them they 're on a secret mission - which is the truth . - I 'll do my best . - I 'm depending upon you , Tigh . If I 'm right ... Uri won 't be the only one who 'll be counting uniforms at that party tonight . I understand . And I hope you are wrong . Well , we 'll see . What are you doing , Colonel ? I didn 't mean to startle you . Can we give you a hand with ... ? If you ever do that again , you 're on report , Starbuck ! Tell your playboy pilots this is not the last inspection I 'm going to make . If I ever find uniforms in this condition , you 're in trouble ! When Commander Adama sees these he 's gonna go crazy ! It 's gotta be the pressure . It 's unfair . Bridge officers never get to go to the surface , while everybody else has a good time . Bridge officers don 't get shot at flying around . - I wouldn 't mind trading with them . - I believe you . I 'll mention it to the colonel . I can 't take over for him . I 'm not a colonel . Neither am I. - So much for guilt . Let 's go to the party . - Right . Hello , Father . Apollo . Well ... Erm ... Colonel Tigh wants to be at the celebration , so I offered to relieve him for the night . It was simply a favour . I thought you 'd like to see your son getting a star cluster . It 's well deserved . Well deserved . Precisely why I cannot accept it as anything but another of Councillor Uri 's ploys . How can saluting his rival 's son be a ploy ? I have the feeling that he 'll propose destroying our arms at the celebration , hoping that the cascade of emotion will do all the damage before they realise what they 've done . - But you can stop him . - I ... Not any more . Haven 't you heard the talk ? - I got us into this predicament . - No one believes that . Even if some do , you have to speak out . You 've been more than a father to me . You 've been someone I could look up to with trust and respect . My ideals rise and fall on your standards , and this isn 't you . What 's happening to you ? Help me to understand . You 'll understand , my son . In time , you 'll understand . I know that wasn 't easy for you , not telling him . - Perhaps you should have . - No . No , if I told him , I wouldn 't have been able to keep him from my side . This is my gamble . If I win , we all win . But if you 're wrong , Uri will destroy you . I 'm not wrong . The Cylons lured me into their deception once . Never again . Guaranteed ? Easy . You can 't lose . - That 's very strange . - What is ? That man 's insignia is Blue Squadron . I thought I knew everybody in it . And look at the fit of that uniform . Apollo , tonight is a night of thanksgiving . Everyone 's dressing up and making do with whatever they have . He probably hasn 't worn that in years . Besides , the guest of honour looks absolutely delicious . - Hi . - How lovely you look in your uniform . Oh , how ? Hey , isn 't this something , Boxey ? Our hosts have been very generous . - I don 't like them . - What ? I said the Ovions wouldn 't approve of him bringing Muffit . Well , we put one over on ' em , didn 't we ? Except for your captain , I deduce from the uniforms - that most of your warriors are here . - Well , I 'm always a big draw . Muffit , come back here ! You daggit , come back here ! Starbuck . What is it ? I 'm talking to the great and near-great . When you come down , tell me who that is . Those three guys . They sure have lousy tailors . - Starbuck , you should know them . - Why should I know them ? They 're wearing our squadron insignia . Don 't start without me . Where is the lieutenant going ? - Erm ... To find the captain . - Excellent . What 's going on ? - Stop those guys ! Stop ' em ! - What are you ... ? - What are you doing , Starbuck ? - Something 's going on here . Those three impostors , I just ... Listen , can we talk ? Yeah . Will you excuse us ? The lieutenant needs attention . I 'll take Boxey and get some food . Where is Boxey ? He 's probably watching the acrobats . They 're good . Don 't be long . You don 't want to miss your own coronation . - What 's this about impostors ? - I don 't know . I keep running into guys who aren 't from our unit but they 're wearing our clothes . That officer in the shuttle . - You spotted one of them ? - Yeah , maybe . I think we 'd better check this out . I suggest that you find your two friends and tell them that we 're going to begin with or without them . Yes , sir . - Looks deserted . - Everyone 's at the party . No , three impostors are down here . How many warriors ? Nearly their full complement of warriors . Keep the humans entertained until the end . Then they will be yours in the lower chambers . This night , we celebrate a most special event in the annals of human experience . - Starbuck , what 'd you find ? - They must be at another level . - They 're inaccessible to humans . - I wondered about that . So did I. I know how to fix that . Stand back . You 're the gambler , pick a level . Let 's have a look at what 's furthest from the guest rooms . - Mm , nice - Shh . Mm , you 're the leader . .. against any living brother , whether a former friend or foe ... Muffit ! .. remembered in the era as the dark ... Me and my big mouth . At least we know the secret of Carillon . Let 's go . - Wait ! You go . - What are you talking about ? We don 't know the connection between the casino and the mining . They could be supplying half the fuel for the Cylon Empire . We just can 't leave it fully operational . Our entire population 's up on top . Including women and children . You warn them . I won 't do anything until you 've got away . What can you do by yourself ? This whole planet is loaded with Tylium . If I can ignite it with my laser , it 'll blow apart . I can 't leave you down here . - You 'll never get out alive . - You don 't have a choice . I had to leave Zac behind . I can 't leave you , too . You go . I 'll set fire to the Tylium . - By the time we finish arguing ... - Somebody 's coming . Muffit ! Run , Boxey ! - Is it too late to try talking to them ? - I think so . Oh , my God ! Some are probably from our ships . No wonder no one 's ever left here to tell about this resort . The Ovions are living off of them ... and selling the Tylium to the Cylons . - There 's Muffit ! - Boxey ! No ! Muffit ! Muffit ! Starbuck ! Let 's go ! Follow me ! Report , Centurion . It is done , Imperious Leader . Let the attack begin . By your command , Imperious Leader . We 're doing fine . Oops . There 's too many ! Set fire to the Tylium . That must be why you 're a captain ! Call out the entire garrison . Scanner 's picking up a large body of objects . Scan for alien forms . This way , this way ! Run , Boxey ! Where you guys been ? We 've been looking all over for you . Come on ! When the fires reach hyper-combustion , the whole planet 's gonna blow ! Frack ! Form scan positive . Multiple three-passenger vehicles . Cylon attack craft . So they spring their trap . Enemy approaching . 90 microns . Arm weapons . .. an opportunity to throw down our arms and prove once and for all that peace begets peace and love begets love . - And so I ... - Everybody listen to me ! Move quickly and orderly towards the exits . - That is an order ! - Stay where you are . I 'm in charge here . Do what he says ! He 's in charge . Here , Muffit ! I 'm going to save you . Enemy closing , 70 microns . Enemy approaching , 55 microns . Serina , take Boxey . I 'll be back . Let 's go ! Move it out ! Take it easy . Wait ! We can 't leave without Muffit . We can 't leave without Muffit ! Better go ! Where are these landrams coming from ? - I don 't know . - From Commander Adama . 35 microns and closing . Why are you in combat dress ? We didn 't go to the party , sir . You had to go , though , or they 'd know they didn 't have us all . Then who were those guys ? Anybody the Commander could find that could fill a uniform . Enemy closing , 30 microns . Recall all warriors from surface . - Stand by to attack . - 25 microns and closing . What 's going on ? - Whole squadron 's waiting for orders . - Yahoo ! 15 microns . Cylon attack force now closing to killer range . They 'll take you in the shuttle . - Let 's go ! - Bye ! Take care of your mom . I wish he could be my daddy . Enemy closing in . Ten microns . They are not sending out interceptors . We have taken them completely by surprise . Closing in , five microns . Four , three , two , one ... Positive shield , now ! - ' Starbuck ? ' - Rewed and ready for takeoff . He 's coming right at us . - Fire in the bay ! - Damage control . - Your wing ready , Jolly ? - Ready , sir . - ' Boomer ? ' - Ready , Captain . Let 's go . There 's nothing to stop them . Sir , incoming squadron doesn 't match any known Cylon machines . Aren 't they gonna be surprised ? If we don 't stop ' em , we 'll have to live on that rock . That one 's for the Atlantia . Here 's one for Zac . Father , they 're ours - all of them . But how ? A lot of our boys violated orders and skipped the party . - We must discuss discipline . - Yes , sir . - ' Starbuck ? ' - Yo . - ' On your tail ! ' - No problem . Felgercarb ! - Boomer , give him a hand . - On my way . Don 't take too long , Boomer . 'Thanks for the assist . ' 'Vector Alpha . I 'm onto three . 'Make that two . 'Let 's go ! ' Press it home . 'We got ' em on the run . ' Now let 's find that Cylon base ship . Nothing on my scanner . 'It must be behind Carillon . 'We 're not going to let it go . ' They can follow us until the reinforcements arrive . Let 's go beneath the scanners . Warriors requesting permission to locate and pursue Cylon base ship . No . We must conserve our resources if we 're to find a home for our people . Bring the fleet home . 'Get on a Cylon frequency . ' They can 't see us , but they 'll hear us . Doing what , praying ? No , you 'll be Red and Blue Squadrons , - I 'll be Green and Yellow . - Red and Blue ? Oh , I get it . Sir , two of our warriors are overdue and unaccounted for . - Who ? - It 's Captain Apollo , sir . - Who else ? - And Starbuck . I see . Switching frequencies now . 'Green Leader to Red . All ships in attack formation . ' Er ... Yeah . Yeah , we 're all ready . Every one of us . - Speak , Centurion . - By your command . Colonial viper squadrons approaching in large numbers . Surely our raiders are close enough to defend us ? Our raiders are still engaged against the Galactica . Retreat base ship behind the protection of Carillon . Their scanners will not find us . 'This is Yellow Leader . We have contact . ' 'Right . I 've got two more squadrons 'requesting to join us - Purple and Orange Squadrons . ' They 're dying for a good fight . Purple and Orange ? Er , negative , Blue Leader . We 've got all the manpower we need to knock out one base ship . We 're picking up signals between Purple and Orange Squadrons . We don 't have those squadrons . Purple and Orange ? Starbuck and Apollo ? Lord help them both . The warriors continue to advance - at least six squadrons . Recall all raiders to defend base ship . Our raiders are all destroyed . All destroyed ? How ? We took them by surprise . Apparently it was not as big a surprise as we had hoped for . Retreat closer to Carillon , below their scanners . There are reports of fires . - Lower . Or they will destroy us . - By your command . Just ahead . There she is . 'What do we do , ram her ? ' We are now picking up warriors on the scanner . We are too close to the surface . Telemetry reports surface of Carillon reaching vapour point . There are only two ships . It is a deception . 'Open fire and retreat from the planet . ' - Er , Apollo ... - OK , Starbuck , let 's go , before the Tylium we set on fire blows the planet apart ! Negative shield , now . She 's going to explode . Let 's go home . Some home . A piece of metal in the middle of nowhere . It beats just plain nowhere , at least until we find Earth . Think we 'll ever find it ? We 'll find it . Someday . Let 's go in . 'Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny , 'the last battlestar , Galactica , 'leads a ragtag fugitive fleet 'on a lonely quest ... 'a shining planet 'known as Earth . ' You are Baltar ? As if you don 't remember . My predecessor has left me with a difficult choice . Your ... - .. predecessor ? - Was destroyed by your peers . A foolish miscalculation of the will of your people . I - I-I-I tried to warn him . I could 've helped . I could 've prevented his ... Yes . I have examined your epistle suggesting you would be able to locate the humans . I can ! Oh , yes . I think as they do . I - I-I-I know where they will go , what they must do . I find your reasoning logical . Then ... I am to be ... Spared . - To serve the Empire ! - No . To serve your people . To help us extend the hand of truce . Truce ? My predecessor was programmed at a time when our empire was less capable of tolerance . Now that we are omnipotent we can afford to be more charitable . You will explain my policy of goodwill . I have spared you , I will spare them . They are ... not likely to be receptive . I will send with you a base star entirely under your command . Lucifer ?

 ( Sarah ) Just kneel down by the door , just outside the door . Come along , Rob , kneel down by the door . It 's easy enough to open the door , easy enough to let us out . - How ? - Put your face close to the door . Come along , Rob , you can do it ! ( Sarah ) That 's right ... That 's fine . Now then , all you have to do is to say a rhyme . A nursery rhyme , an old one . Any one , providing it 's old . Well , can 't you remember one ? Then just say it , Rob , just say it ! Say it ! - I can 't ! - Say it ! I 'm too old to say nursery rhymes ! ( Sarah ) Well then , let 's call it history . - You 're old enough for history . - Yes . A lot of nursery rhymes are history , I taught you that , didn 't I ? - No ! - So say the one in your head . - Which one ? - The one in your head now . - Think of the soldiers . - Soldiers ... Climbing the stairs , swords in their hands , searching for people ! - Goosey goosey gander ! - That 's the one ! Where shall I ... Whither shall I wander ? - Upstairs and downstairs ... - ( Footsteps ) In my ... ( Banging ) 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' No ! Sapphire ! Steel ! Steel ! - It could not have been your mother . - ( Rob ) But it called to me ! - Called your name ? - Yes , it called ! " Rob ! " Like that . I thought it was my mother , it was her voice . Just like it - except it got a few things wrong , it made mistakes . I wasn 't fighting her this time , honest ! The voice called me . I had to go , didn 't I ? - Have they all stopped again ? - Yes . ( Rob ) I did as I was told , I wouldn 't have gone up otherwise . I believe you ... this time . - The soldiers came out of the room ? - No , they came up the stairs . Well , not all the way up , they just kind of appeared on the top staircase . ( Ticking ) ( Sapphire ) Something could 've been let loose - a visual refraction . ( Rob ) Visual refraction ? Yes , you 'd call them ... What would he call them ? - ( Steel ) Ghosts . - Ghosts ? ! - Did anything come out of that room ? - No ! And the door 's not nailed up any more . - ( Steel ) No ? - No , it 's a different door . - Another refraction ? - Probably . Look , I saw it ! I mean , you can 't have a ghost door as well , can you ? Yes . ( Rob ) But those soldiers looked solid . ( Sapphire ) They would . They kicked the door open . ( Clock ticking ) ( Steel ) What is it ? Something . I 'm not sure , just something . - ( Clock ticking ) - Is it still going ? Yes . But it 's lost seven minutes . - Since we came up the stairs ? - Yes . - Dad 's had that clock for years . - Has it been reliable ? I don 't really know . This is where the soldiers first appeared . Are you sure nothing came out of that room ? No , I told you ! Anyway , it 'll be open now , the different door . - Look , I 'll show you ! - Wait . ( Rob ) You see ? It 's back as it was . And so is the clock . So those seven minutes were lost down there on that landing . ( Footsteps ) ( Steel ) Keep still ! And that 's what you saw ? They didn 't seem different ? The clock 's working perfectly , it didn 't stop or lose time . They didn 't affect it . But something did . ( Steel runs downstairs ) When the voice called to you , which rhyme did you say ? Which one did you choose ? I didn 't exactly choose . I was more or less told to say it . - Told to say it ? - Yes . - It was kind of put into my head . - Which one ? Don 't say it out loud . Look at me . Look at me and remember exactly what you said . Say it in your mind . 'Goosey goosey gander ! 'Where shall I ... Whither shall I wander ? 'Upstairs and downstairs . ' And you only said those three lines out loud ? - Yes . - Then the soldiers appeared ? Yes . ( Distorted voices ) Upstairs and downstairs , upstairs and downstairs ... - Sapphire ? - Upstairs and downstairs ... Yes , Steel . Do it again . Walk up the stairs again . Nothing . ( Steel ) So what do we do , blame the clock ? ( Sapphire ) The first nursery rhyme is from the time of the plague and the second one has historical relevance . It refers to the Parliamentary wars . Parliamentary wars ? Cromwell 's troops searched for people who wouldn 't pray . - Wouldn 't pray ? - Unbelievers . - Ah . - Don 't you know your history ? I know mine , yes . But you must have heard of Cromwell ? How many lines of that second rhyme did you say ? Three . I wouldn 't say it all . I fought it . So the danger is still contained in that room . And the visual refraction , those soldiers , they 're harmless . They 're just things let loose . Does she mean let loose by the breakthrough ? Yes . You mean not part of the plan ? They must be harmless , those soldiers are an anachronism . They must have lived a hundred years before this house was built . Most of this is history gone wrong . We 've never had that before . Then again , maybe it is part of the plan . What ? The confusion , it 's a way of diverting us . From what ? I don 't know , but they know it 's us . They won 't use tricks we already know , will they ? ( Sapphire ) ' Steel ! ' ( Steel ) Sapphire ? Sapphire ? 'Here , Steel . ' Speak to me . - ' I 'm in a room , a tiny room . ' - How are you standing ? - ' Facing a wall . ' - You haven 't moved ? - ' No , I 'm as I was with you . ' - You 're in the house , remember that , and don 't move , don 't make yourself a part of that room . 'No . We walked right into it , didn 't we ? 'I walked right into it . ' Don 't think that , you 're still in this house with us , right ? Sapphire ? 'Yes , I heard that . ' Good . Now , describe the room to me . 'It 's part of a cottage . 'Probably the scullery in an old cottage . ' ( Steel ) Day or night ? ( Sapphire ) ' Day . ' ( Steel ) But it 's night . Keep remembering that it 's night and you 're here with us . Think of that room as a picture , nothing else , - you 're seeing a picture . - It was a picture . - Yes ? - ' The one at the top of the stairs . ' Yes , I can see it . 'It was waiting for us in the picture . 'It wants me to think I 'm in that cottage . ' - Well , you 're not . - No . It 's cold here . ( Steel ) ' You 're not in that room , Sapphire . ' It 's very cold here . - Something happened in here once . - ( Steel ) ' That room ? ' ( Sapphire ) ' Something terrible . 'It knows that . It wants me to know it . 'It wants me to sense it . ' It wants me ... to be a part of this room . To be a part of what happened . ( Steel ) ' Sapphire ? 'Sapphire ! ' It 's all right , I 'm in control of it . I won 't think what it wants me to think . ( Steel ) ' Now , when I tell you , I want you to do something for me . 'I want you to look over your right shoulder . 'Do it very quickly and then back . 'Uh ... Can you hear me ? ' Yes . 'I want to know if you can still see the picture . 'Very quickly , then back . 'Now ! 'Sapphire ? ' It 's all right . The picture 's not there but ... - ' No ! Are you facing the same way ? ' - Yes . Good , then stay like that . Don 't move . Can 't we get the picture ? Wouldn 't that stop it ? ( Sapphire ) ' lf you tried , you 'd end up in this room with me . ' ( Coin clatters ) ( Sapphire ) ' What was that ? ' Couldn 't we smash the picture ? It wouldn 't smash what 's hiding inside it . ( Sapphire ) ' Apart from which , you might smash me . ' Sapphire ... could you try to take time back ? I could try , yes . - Even ten minutes would do it . - ' I 'll try . Will you help me ? ' Yes . Now , concentrate . ( Rhythmic throbbing ) - Rob ? - Shh . Go to sleep , Helen . No , I want Sapphire . Where is she ? - ( Steel ) Keep her down there . - Is she upstairs ? - ( Steel ) Sapphire , take it back ! - ' Yes , Steel . ' I can hear her ! But I can 't see her , where is she ? - Be quiet ! - Where are you , Sapphire ? - ( Sapphire ) ' Just do as Rob says . ' - Yes , Sapphire . You 've got to do it now , Sapphire , before it 's too late ! ( Steel ) That 's it ! ( Rob ) Don 't you know your history ? ( Steel ) I know mine , yes . - You must have heard of Cromwell ? - That 's me ! Have many lines of the rhyme did you say ? Three , I wouldn 't say it all . I fought them . Don 't lose it . Don 't lose it ! ( Sapphire ) So the danger is still contained in that room . And the visual refraction , those soldiers , they 're harmless . The room 's swarming with them . They 're just things let loose . ( Rob ) Let loose by the breakthrough ? ( Steel ) Yes . They 're not in the plan ? They must be harmless . Those soldiers are an anachronism . They must have lived a hundred years before this house was even built . Most of this is history gone wrong . We 've never had that before . Keep it going . Keep it going ... - You can do it , Sapphire . - I can 't . - ' You can ! ' - I can 't ! - You can ! - Please , Steel , it 's no good ! It 's in here with me . ( Steel ) ' Sapphire ! ' ( Sapphire ) ' It 's fighting and it 's winning . 'I 'm not strong enough ! I can 't win ! ' You don 't have to win , Sapphire , can you hold it for ... two minutes ? Can you give me two minutes ? ( Sapphire ) ' Yes . 'Steel , be careful . ' What are you going to do ? I 'm going to your father 's workshop . Till I come back , you keep Helen here . - Try to keep Sapphire talking . - Right . - Sapphire , Steel said ... - Yes , I heard . - Is this like the ship ? - ' The what ? ' The job you had to do on a ship . Um , yes , only this is slightly more difficult . Sorry . Only , I 'm supposed to keep you talking . 'You 're doing fine , Rob . ' - Sapphire ... - ' Hello , Helen . ' - I want to see you , Sapphire . - Soon , Helen , soon . - Just be patient , hm ? - ( Helen ) ' Yes . ' - I 'll tell you one thing , Rob ... - Yes ? - ' I 'm glad of the rhyme you chose . ' - What ? You could 've settled for Oranges And Lemons . Then , if roundhead soldiers belong anywhere it 's in this hellhole . ( Marching footsteps ) Rob , do you hear that ? Hear what ? Rob , will you fetch Steel ? Rob , quickly , please ! 'Something terrible happened here ! 'Oh , please ! Help me ! ' Steel ! - ( Steel ) Don 't come in ! - Please , help me . Quickly , please ! ( Steel ) Open the door and stand clear . - Don 't touch me . Don 't come near me . - You 're freezing . ( Steel hissing ) Get the child . Quickly ! - Come on , Helen . - But Sapphire 's upstairs ... Come on ! - Get her away from me . - It 's cold ! ( Steel ) Come on ! Someone was killed in this room - a young girl . It wants me to be her ! It wants it to happen again . - ( Throbbing hum ) - ( Rob ) Steel , don 't ! The girl 's killers are here ! They 've broken down the door ! ( Panicked ) Steel ! ( Gasps ) - Sapphire ! - It 's gone , the room 's gone ! But they haven 't !

 Come on , you wretch . Come on . What 's the matter with you ? Do you want me to sing to you ? Hubert ! What have you done to these cows ? I done nothing to them . What 's wrong with them ? Same as last night . No milk . - What 's that got to do with me ? - You brought them up from the field . - Hello , Mina . - We found the corn . Oh , good lass . - You want us to bring it ? - That 's a good lass . - Isn 't she funny ? - She doesn 't make me laugh . No , I mean funny , like her name . Ina , Mina , Meina , Mo ! Get it ? Oh ! Pet , you got some milk for me ? No , there 's none , Mina . The cows are dry . - Hello , Mina . - Hello . - How 's the baby ? - Fine , thank you . Sorry , Mina . It 's awful . Ruth 's gone to have a look at them . No milk , no butter . I can let you have some cheese if you like . It 's all right , that 's not what I came for . What , then ? Your flour . I 'm doing the baking this week . Oh , yes , the flour 's on the shelf . - But there isn 't enough . - Help yourself to the grinder . The corn 's on the table . Arthur brought my week 's supply last night . I don 't like your grinder . ( LAUGHING ) Nor do I. You 're supposed to do your own grinding . I 've been very busy with the cows . Do enough for both of us . Did you bring any of your herbs with you for a cup of tea ? - They 're in the pram , under the cover . - Okay . He 's just gone to sleep . Don 't wake him . ( BABY CRYING ) I didn 't wake him . He cried by himself . Well now , are we having this mill ? Ask Charles . He 's got some ideas about it . - Want a cup ? - No , thank you . I think you should grind a couple of pounds for yourself . I 'll go fetch Peggy 's meantime . - Take the baby with you . - Oh , it 's very bumpy . Please , Mina , I 've got Paul to see to . - Who ? - Jenny 's baby . ( BABY CRYING ) - Well , it looks as if it 's all clear . - Yep . Should we give it a try ? A good idea . See if our plan works . She 's beginning to move ! Right . ( SHOUTING ) What happened ? Ah , some of the wooden blades have rotted away . The water can 't build up enough power to turn the wheel . - Forget it . - No . We know it will work . That wheel turned . Yeah , it 'll work if we replace a dozen or so blades with the right sort of wood , yeah . We know it works right back to here . That crown wheel turned . Let 's see what we 've got upstairs . Well , there 's not much point connecting up to this . Turns too fast and it works off electricity , something we don 't have . No , but we have got water power . Well , there 's plenty of water , but there 's no power , Charles . But if you replace the blades and then fitted new gears , and reface and remounted the old millstones , that 's if you can find them , well , then you would have water power and you could grind corn , three times a year . No , we would have power . Greg , don 't you see ? Power to operate a drill , a saw , a small generator . Electricity ! You can 't do it , Charles . We need this mill . Look , we make a start in the spring , we can work on through the summer , yes ? For a start , you 're going to have more light and if Arthur and the rest bring us back enough salt , you can have full manpower . I still want Jack to check these bearings . Peggy ? Peggy ! - Who is it ? - It 's Mina ! I 'm in the bath ! I 'm doing me washing . What do you want now ? Your flour . I 'm ready for baking . - Oh , I 've got two jars ready for you . - Right . Oh , it 's you . Uh , just refreshing meself after me morning 's work . Here , you never said good morning to me . I 'm sorry . Good morning . Morning . I was up at your little hut at the crack of dawn . - You were fast asleep . - Oh , so you looked in , did you ? - Mina ! - I got them ! Mina , why do you lock your door ? - To keep you out . - Me ? Mina , you were lovely , lying there asleep . I wasn 't up at the crack of dawn because the baby was crying in the night . Oh , they 're a good pair of lungs , great for crying . Mina , can you make me a couple of milk rolls ? No , there 's no milk ! Mina , put the kettle on the hob . I want to talk to you about the milk . Mina ! - Mina , why won 't you let me in ? - My business . - It 's lonely for you up there . - That 's how I like it . It 's unnatural , that is . I don 't like to be on me own . You 're not . There 's Peggy and the others . Peggy ! She 's not like you , Mina . What 's your hurry ? I 'm going to Pet 's to get her flour . She 's grinding it . If I lived with you , Mina , I could help you with things like that . I don 't need help , not from you . - Let me in , Mina . - Why ? I fancy you , girl . Well , I don 't fancy you . You 're a fine figure of a woman , you are . No , I 'm not . That 's the way I think of it anyway . I 'm ugly , Hubert . I 'm as ugly as you are . - Come here ! - JOHN : Why ? What do you want ? Who lives in there ? Mina , and the baby . You know that . Do I , though ? Come here . Shh ! Quiet . You shouldn 't be here , should you ? Yes , we should . We 've brought flour for baking . It 's baking day . And Jenny 's away . - Yeah , but you come here a lot . - Why shouldn 't we ? Dangerous . You shouldn 't come here at all . But why not , Hubert ? What do you see ? Table . Chairs . - Shelves . - Yeah , what 's on the shelves ? - Herbs and things . - Mmm-hmm . And what 's that ? The oven . And what do you think she puts in there ? Food . Children . I don 't believe you . You calling me a liar , lad ? I tell you , she puts kids your size in there and shrivels them down to that . So don 't you come here , specially at night . - Hello . What 's going on ? - Oh , nothing , is there , John ? Just John looking in through the window . You meant no harm , did you , Lizzie ? No . I think you 're going away now , aren 't you ? Yes . ( BABY CRYING ) Could you give him his rosehip ? The bottle 's likely dropped away from him . Well , you 've done it often enough . What 's the matter ? Nothing . There 's something up . No . Will you take him for his walk ? Go on , then , take him for his walk . I 've changed him . Well , you heard what Mina said . Go on , take him for his walk . What 's that ? Flour . What have you been telling them ? Nothing . I just came round here to see how you were , that 's all . How I am ? Tired . They 've taken the baby . Let 's have a nice cup of your special tea . Oh , is that all ? Mina , you know how I feel about you . Stick to your sheep . - Oh , come on now ... - Come on now what ? - Oh , go away and leave me alone . - Oh , you 're just saying that . - Oh , am I ? - Come on now , Mina . Give us a chance . Oh , Mina , Mina ! Oh ! That 's enough now ! Get out now , Hubert . Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! - Get out ! - Don 't shout . I don 't want to shout , but I will ! What are you two doing out here ? Mina asked us to look after her baby . Well , she didn 't ask you to keep it out in the cold , did she ? Well , go on , take it back to her . Go on off home , the pair of you . I 'll look after the baby . - Thanks . - Oh , thanks . And get yourselves in front of the fire and get warm . Go on . Stupid , sending kids out in weather like this . - Well , I 'll have a talk to her . - You 're all right , are you ? Come on , young fellow . Take you home . Oh , there 's my boy , then . Where 's my boy ? - ( CHUCKLES ) He 's doing very well . - Oh , yes . Well , the children were frozen . Oh , I don 't know where they got to . I was worried . They should have come back when it started to get cold , shouldn 't they ? - Where 'd they go ? - They were just outside , in the open . They never were . I been going out every minute for half an hour and calling . Why didn 't they come in ? Oh , I don 't know , Mina . They seemed ... They seemed scared to come in . Scared ? ( SNIFFING ) - The bread smells good . - It isn 't risen enough for baking yet . Oh ? Well , there 's something in the oven . - No , don 't ! - Sorry ! What , uh ... What is it ? Oh , well , it 's nothing . - Biscuits ? - Well , it 's flour and water . I rolled it into little balls , but they 've gone flat . I wanted to make , you know , oh , marbles for the children to play with . Oh , I see . Oh , they been so good with the baby , taking her , but they 're no good . ( CHUCKLES ) Mmm . And tasteless . They 're not bad . You know , you need clay to make marbles . Did you ever see that done ? Yes , I did . A potter woman with a wheel , she made cups and bowls and jugs . - That 's an idea . Did you ever try it ? - I never did . - Would you like to ? - Well , I don 't know . I wouldn 't mind . I 'll have a talk to Greg . There 's plenty of clay around here . Oh , after we 've made a flourmill . Thanks for the biscuit . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) MINA : Someone there ? Hello , who 's there ? Mina , I 've got something here for you . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) - Mina , let me in . - Go away ! I 've got a ring . It was my mother 's . Hubert , if you wake my baby , I 'll give you what for . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Mina ? What ? What 'll you give me ? You 'll have to open the door to give it to me . Ah , Mina ! Mina ! What are you doing down there , Mina ? Nothing . What do you want with that ? Nothing . Bucket of mud ? I checked all the mill bearings . Everything seems okay . - Just seized up . - You can say that again . Well , they certainly knew how to build in those days . It 's as sound as a bell . We 've got to learn that technology all over again , Jack . Hmm , and hump all the millstones back from wherever they 've been scattered . What about the roof of my pigsty ? My pigs come before your old mill . - Is there any more wine , Pet ? - Is there ? I 'll go . - How are your spuds ? - I wish I knew . - Not found anything ? - No . - Then , I 'm not a botanist . - Just give them more time . Well , it 's not as easy as that . We need fresh stock , and we can 't get fresh stock . We 'll just have to make do with a smaller yield . I hope that 's all it is , and not some disease . Well , look , let 's just stick to problems we know about , like grinding corn . Now , I say that the watermill 's for later . What I can do is build you a bore mill , fill it with pebbles , like I suggested . All right then , let 's see the design . I 'd better go see to those children . They 're eating us out of house and home . Does anyone know what 's up with those two ? I haven 't been able to get a word out of John and Lizzie since that business yesterday with Mina 's baby . Oh , they 've probably done something . You know how children are , afraid of what she might say . Well , Mina , I mean , she 's always been a bit strange . Comes from being too much on her own . She ought to mix more . Yeah , she was scrabbling about in the mud yesterday . - We brought you more mud . - Like you asked for . Thanks . Put it down there . Well , come on , by the stove . Hurry now . Can we go now ? - I got something to show you . - What ? In the oven . Wait . I think they 're ready now . There . They 're hard enough . Ooh , don 't you touch them . Wait till they cool . And ... Who 's that ? Who does it look like ? It 's Hubert . I baked him . Oh ! I made him too thin . Oi ! - It 's Hubert ! - Hubert ! Hubert ! Hubert 's got a broken leg ! He has ! We 've seen him ! - I know , I 've been binding it . - But she broke it ! Who broke it ? It isn 't broken , it 's sprained . - She sprained it ! - Who did ? Mina ! We saw her ! - When did you see her ? - Now ! Just now ! Hubert sprained his ankle last night when he was out walking , he said . But she took a little Hubert out of the oven and she broke its leg ! She did , really ! Holy mother of God , what have we got amongst us ? She put a little Hubert in the oven ? Now , wait a minute . Hold it ! Oh , for ... What 's going on ? What 's the matter with you kids ? Oh , Hubert ! " Oh , Hubert ! Oh , Hubert ! " My leg 's damned sore . Now ... JOHN : Mina 's a witch , isn 't she ? Yeah , well , that 's not what I 'd call her . Tell him what you just said . She made a little Hubert with a broken leg and baked it . - She did what ? - RUTH : Now , why would she do that ? Well , I knocked at her door last night . - Oh . - Happened to be passing . Just happened to be passing ? There 's nothing beyond her place . Well , that 's what I mean . It 's lonely for her up there . I thought she might like a bit of company . I know what you thought . It 's true , I tell you . Then the baby woke up and cried , she threatened me . She threatened you ? Yeah , uh , she said she 'd do something to me . What ? Just that , she 'd do something to me , and I went off and went over on me ankle . - She did it . - Oh , rubbish ! We saw her ! Whatever you saw , there 's no connection . That 's what she was doing , all right . - Is she a witch ? - No ! What were you doing , then ? Looking at them potatoes through your microscope . Jack saw you . What stopped them sprouting ? What put a curse on them ? What about the cows ? We saw her gathering mud . We did . She was gathering mud . We brought her some , in a bucket . Why did you do that ? - She told us to . - She made us ! - She made you ? - We were frightened . You were frightened ? But why ? She 's a witch . Didn 't you ask her why she wanted the mud ? No . We were frightened . What about Pet and the herbs ? She tried to poison Pet with those blooming herbs ! She never did . Hubert , come with me . Children , stay right where you are . Come on . Now , stop this ! Can you kill witches ? Mina is not a witch . Doesn 't mean anything . I know it doesn 't . But it gives me prickles up and down my spine . - Yes , but what are we going to do ? - Well , I 'm in the thick of it . Things out of mud ? Charles said one of us should be doing pottery before we forget . But that was to be me . She 's no right . Yes , but what I mean is , what about the baby ? - Baby ? - Yes . If she 's doing all them things to everything else , what is she doing to that poor little mite ? Now , wait a minute , it 's me I 'm thinking about . She ain 't gonna do nothing to the baby . I don 't believe it . I mean , she can think she 's doing things to people , - but she can 't actually do it . - She done it to me ! She 's got those children fetching and carrying for her . It 's not only people . What about the cows and the spuds ? - Yeah . - I mean , she meant nothing to me . I 'm asking you , did she ? I mean , you know me . I go me own way , keep meself to meself . I mean , I 'm choosy . I 've always been choosy . I mean , you 've only got to look at her . It don 't make sense ! There am I , lying in bed of a night , she 's the only thing I can think of , so I gets to think I 'm going out me mind . What 'd she put in there ? What I 'm asking you is , what is she doing to the baby ? ( SNIFFING ) - Where you going ? - I don 't know . We must be sensible , keep our heads . I 'm going to go and see her . - What ? - It 's true . - Where 's Charles ? - He 's inside . Now I know the real meaning of boredom . Oh , for power . Man 's in bondage again . - Have you told him ? - No . What ? Mina 's been making dolls out of mud and putting curses on people . ( LAUGHING ) - And you 've seen her doing it ? - Well , I 've seen her collecting the mud . She made this mannequin of Hubert with the leg broken , and he broke his leg . - Hubert broke his leg ? - Well , sprained . - Ah , sprained . - Well , that 's what Ruth said . She didn 't think it was broken , but she couldn 't tell , not having an x-ray . So Mina made a witch 's doll . That 's what you 're saying ? Look , don 't go on at me . It 's what everyone 's saying , and I 'm telling you . She put this thing in the oven . - She made a figure of Hubert ? - So they say . - How do they know it was Hubert ? - What ? How was it recognisable ? I don 't know . John and Lizzie said it was Hubert . Said Mina told them so . Mina , what are you doing ? Oh , just playing about , I ... I don 't want you to see it , 'cause I 've not finished with it . It 's a head . I saw . - Oh , it 's a kind of head . - Made of mud . Well , that mud 's good , you know . I tried it to see , and it 's like clay . - You should try it . - Yes , I might . - You made a doll of Hubert . - Who told you ? Oh ! Oh , the children . Yes , I did , and his leg broke . What is it ? You know about Hubert ? I know what ? He 's been pestering me , I know that . - His leg 's broken . - What ? The man Hubert has broken his leg . - Where is the doll ? - Well , it 's le ... I ... I threw it away . - What are you meaning ? - What are you meaning ? - Whose head is it ? - Oh , no one . It 's no one , it 's just ... It isn 't finished . I ... It 's a lump . And I wanted to make it big so it wouldn 't break this time . - You don 't want it to break ? - Well , no . I ... I want a head . Let me see . It 's got a beard . It 's Charles ! You want him ! ( MINA SOBBING ) What are you doing ? I ... I 'm not doing anything . I ... I live here alone with my baby ! I ... He isn 't there now , is he ? I destroyed him . You destroyed him ? What about your baby ? What ? Matthew ! Matthew ! Matthew ! Matthew ! Anyone ! Where 's my baby ? Matthew ! What are we going to do , Pet ? - I 'll get Charles . - No , the kids have gone for him . What we need is the Holy Church . The Father , he 'd know what to do . She can 't stay here . She mustn 't be allowed to stay here . Oh , it 's not her , it 's the devil in her . - There we are . - Give him to me . The poor mite 's hungry . ( SILENT PRAYING ) Get out ! Get out ! But where 's my baby ? Oh , God save us and protect us . Shield us from all evil . - Stop her putting curses on this house . - Peggy ! I want my baby ! - Where 's the baby ? - He 's in there . PET : Charles , no ! There we are . There you are . He 's all right , Mina . You wrap him up well . Now , I 'll come by later and talk to you , all right ? - You don 't know what you 're doing ! - I know perfectly well what I 'm doing . - Do you ? - Oh ! Now , where 's Hubert ? - He 's in the kitchen . - You get him . - And you should be ashamed of yourself . - I 'm not . And if anything happens to that child , you 'll only have ... Then you must be out of your mind ! There 's something wrong with that woman . There 's nothing wrong with that woman . She 's as normal as ... Go on . Well , I was going to say she 's as normal as you are , but now I 'm not so sure . How dare you ? How did you hurt yourself ? - She did it . - Who 's " she " ? - Mina ! She 's a witch ! - Oh , really ? - And when did you last see one ? - What ? I 'm curious to know what they look like . When did you last see a witch ? It 's not what they look like , it 's what they do . Oh , I see . And where were you when you hurt yourself ? - Well , were you here , in your room ? - I was at her house . Oh , at Mina 's house . And what were you doing there ? - Nothing . - You were pestering her . - Well , she made me . - You fancy her . I tell you , she made me . She made you fancy her so you went up to her house and tried to get in , is that right ? But she wouldn 't let you in . Now , does that sound like a woman who made you fancy her ? Wouldn 't she have welcomed you in ? She 's a witch . She 's a woman , living on her own . And you 're a man , living on his own . It 's happened before in the history of the world . Now , how did you injure yourself ? - She attacked me . - How ? She wiped a wet nappy across his face . She just told me . Well , well , well ... What a wicked , wicked thing for a woman to do . And there 's nothing wrong with the cows either . Hubert brought them in from the field and left them when he went to a-wooing . The calves sucked them dry . Oh , me leg ! Oh ! Mina ? Mina ? - Mina ... - Go away . Please , go away . - No , Mina , listen , it 's all right now . - No , no , it isn 't . Mina , they 've ... They 've made absolute fools of themselves . They know it now . - Until the next time . - How do you mean ? Well , the next time something happens . I ... - I got to go away from here . - Mina , that 's nonsense . It 's not safe for me . I ... It isn 't and I ... I 'm frightened . I 'm frightened for me and for my baby . What happens the next time there 's a thunderstorm and a tree comes down ? I can just hear the children , " It 's her ! It 's her ! It 's the witch ! " And the rest of them believing ... Now , Mina , listen ... What happens when something happens to you ? When you 're repairing a roof or digging a ditch and something happens ? They 'll kill me ! They 'll throw stones at me ! - They 'll burn me ! - Now , stop it ! Stop it ! You 're being hysterical , and you 're almost as bad as the others . And you 're talking rubbish , absolute rubbish . Now , stop it ! ( SOBBING ) There now . There now , it 's all right . It 's all right . Now , you listen , Mina . Do you remember in the old days , not so long ago , people used to believe in witches , they were laughed at , hmm ? That 's because we had newspapers and radio and television and doctors , psychiatrists and priests to explain it all . That kept things in proportion . So if people wanted to believe in ghosts or witches , they could do so without frightening the rest of us . Do you see what I mean ? Come on now , bear up . They 've all made charlies of themselves . Now , you listen . - I don 't think I should stay here . - Now , come on . No . Oh , I don 't know . If you really believe something , you don 't just stop believing it , and they believed it . Peggy and that Hubert and Pet even . Oh , Mina , Mina , Pet 's kicking herself . It was just jealousy . - And thinking of my baby . - Yes . And I 've always felt strange here , not part of it somehow , sort of by myself . Yes , but whose fault is that ? Oh , yes , I know , but ... I think I should go . Where ? I 'll take my chances . Well , you 'll take your chances , but is it right to take chances with the baby in this weather ? I 'll find a place . Oh , yes , there are lots of places . But better than this ? Where you 're known ? Where I 'm known ? Mina , give us a few days . A few weeks . Give them a chance , Mina . Give us all a chance . You are a nice man . You 're a good man . It 's a pity Jenny 's not around . Well , if the others weren 't away on a salt detail , none of this would have happened . Still , I think she 'll stay . I 'll get Pet to come up here and have a talk with her . - Could kill that creep Hubert . - Do you want some help ? Yeah , well , you restrain yourselves . He 's more use to us alive . Not much in it if you ask me . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( DOOR OPENING ) Oi ! - Where 'd you get that ? - I 've been keeping it . Have you ? - Hey , now , look ... - Shut up ! Now , what you 're going to do is get off your backside and go and apologise to Mina . - That 's what you think . - That is what I think ! I also think you haven 't got any choice because if you don 't , I 'm going to beat you into a pulp . Of course , you 've got an alternative . You can get the hell out of this settlement and go and contaminate somewhere else . I feel so ashamed . Hmm . Well , don 't wallow in it , love . Do something about it . - She 'll spit in my eye . - Mmm , I shouldn 't be surprised . Oh , a suggestion . - Take Peggy . - Yes , I will . Mina ! It 's me , Hubert ! ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Mina , let me in . I know you 're in there , Mina . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Mina , if you don 't let me in , there 's going to be trouble . Mina ! Come on , give us a chance ! Well , they can 't say I haven 't tried . - Do you think she 'll like it ? - I 'm sure she will . Come on , then . Ah , Jack , we 're just going to see Mina . Good . I put the kettle on the hob . Help yourself . Mina ! Mina ! She 's gone and she 's taken the baby with her . Right , now it 's nearly dark . She can 't have gone far , not pushing that pram . She 's probably gone by the road . I wouldn 't be too sure . She pushes that thing anywhere . All right , we 'll go round the compass . Jack , you take the top . I 'll take the road . - I 'll go down to the river . - I 'll go with Jack . No , you won 't . You 'll come with me . What about us ? Well , someone 's got to look after the children . Ruth , you and Peggy , take the fields between the river and the road . Yes . Mina ! Mina ! Mina ! Mina ! Come on , eat up . Don 't tell me it 's bedtime already . Long past . Now , come on , hurry up . Drink up . The milk 's funny . It 's lovely . Now , come on , drink it up . It 's like the milk we used to have . Now , let 's not have any nonsense . It 's goats ' milk and it 's better for you . Are we going to sleep here tonight ? Only if you 're good . Mina ! - Mina ! - Mina ! Mina ! - Mina ! - Mina ! Mina ! Mina ! Mina ! ( BABY CRYING ) Mina ... HUBERT : Mina ! ( BABY CRYING ) Mina ! ( RATTLING ) HUBERT : Mina , you in there ? Oh , Mina . It 's me , Hubert . Mina ... Don 't be afraid . Everyone 's out looking for you . Mina , I 'm sorry . Please , please , don 't be afraid . Go away . Stay away from me ! Mina ... It 's going to be all right , Mina . You 've got to believe me . Mina ? Mina ... ( HUBERT GROANING ) It 's all right . It 's all right . How is she ? Why don 't you find out for yourself ? ( WHISPERING ) Go on . Mina ? What have you got there ? You 're a beautiful little boy , yes . - How 's your head ? - It 's me arm now . What 's the matter with it ? Calls this a horsemill . Don 't weaken , Hubert . There are worse fates .

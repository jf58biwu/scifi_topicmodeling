 'Professor Bergman . it 's Jim Nordstrom . 'We 've just passed the laser barrier 'and will start the manual check on the radiation seals in two minutes . ' All right . Nordstrom . we 're watching you closely . Eagle 1-4 from Monitoring Depot . this is Dr Russell . 'Yes ? ' 'When will you finish ? ' 'The last canisters are going in now . About 10 minutes . ' Steiner. when the ship lifts off begin a check on that radiation seal . 'Yes . Doctor . ' - You 're making a thorough check . - Yes . I am . So far their brain activity 's normal . So far . 'Moonbase Alpha from Eagle 2 . we 'll be arriving on schedule . ' 'Eagle 2 from Moonbase Alpha. we copy . ' 'Commander Koenig. we 'll be landing at 23.35 lunar time . ' - Coffee . Commander ? - Thank you . 'Commissioner Simmonds is calling from Earth . ' I 'll take it . 'Ahh . John . Well. you 're signed . sealed and approved . 'The Space Commission 's ratified you as Commander of Moonbase Alpha . ' What about Gorski ? 'Oh . I relieved him of his command an hour ago . 'He 's not your problem . 'No. your job is to put man on Meta . ' Any new information ? 'How do you like this ? 'The first close-up shot of the planet Meta . 'taken from the unmanned Spacefarer 9. just in . ' - Atmosphere . - ' Not only that . 'We 're receiving signals. loud and clear. relayed from the same probe . 'There 's no doubt about it . 'planet Meta could be supporting life as we know it . 'John. the Meta probe astronaut virus infection mustn 't stop us . 'We must make a manned landing on Meta . 'Nothing must stop us . 'Nothing . ' 'Good luck . ' 'We 're getting great pictures of the Meta probe launch platform . 'I 'll put them up for you . 'There 's the probe ship docking now . ' Looks good . But I 'd like to see it on its way to Meta . 'That 's the lot . Professor . It all checks out . 'There 's definitely no radiation leakage . 'We 're coming in now . ' Good . Steiner . Thank you . Increased brain activity . Steiner . Nordstrom 's in trouble . Security . Get out there and bring Nordstrom in . 'Yes. sir . ' 'Doctor. he is in trouble . - ' I need help out here ! ' - Get away . Steiner ! 'I 've got to get out of here ! ' Intensive Care. stand by . We have a casualty . 'Gotta get out of here ! 'I 've gotta get out of here ! Agh ! ' Decontamination area. come on . 'Professor ! He 's gone berserk ! 'I can 't hold him ! ' 'Let go . Nordstrom. don 't ... ' 'On final descent . Commander . ' Well . John ... Victor. still here ? Yes . I ... uh . I got caught . Things are far more serious than I suspect you 've been told . What do you mean ? People are dying up here . John . The virus infection ? The virus infection . - Commander Koenig . - Commander Gorski . I think we both know the situation . I imagined you 'd want to be left to settle in . you 've had a tedious journey . Thank you . If you want to talk before I leave . I shall be in my quarters . Good luck . He 's taking it well. considering the abruptness of his suspension . - I 'm sure he 'll survive . - I 'm sure he will . - He 's always been very flexible . - Hmm . - Commander . - Benjamin . - Happy to see you . - And you . - Commander ! - Michael . - Hello. sir . - Tanya Alexandria . Hello . Tanya . Paul. good to see you . All right. no virus . Then what is it ? John . I just don 't know . It looks very much like radiation. but ... But what ? There is no radiation . Victor. you know I won 't ignore the fact that people are dying up here . But the space flight of the century must not slip through our fingers . Of course . That planet is passing just close enough to make a landing . But the problem here may affect the Meta probe . Dr Russell has some ideas ... - Simmonds has told me about her ... - He couldn 't have said much . Commander Gorski refused to let her report her findings . Oh . Look. why don 't you talk to her ? Yes ? 'Dr Russell ? ' - John Koenig . - Commander . Dalmeyer . 1887 . As used by Louis Pasteur and Madame Curie. right ? It 's a replica. a college prize . Doctor. when will our Meta probe astronauts recover from this virus ? It 's not a virus . They have an unusual form of brain damage . Their condition is critical . So they 're not going to recover . What about the backup crew ? Are they medically clear to fly this mission ? They 're as fit as Warren and Sparkman were before . - What does that mean ? - I saw the ninth man die today . One moment he was fine . the next he 'd lost all control . Here . This is a thermographic plate . A malignancy erupts . There 's immediate disorientation . classic in radiation attacks . - You 've had eleven cases so far . - Nine deaths . But all of those who died were workers at Nuclear Disposal Area Two . It 's inconsistent . The Meta probe astronauts never went near there . I know . And there are more inconsistencies . No radiation leakage has been recorded there . But the probe astronauts and backup crews have lived the same lives . been through the same training program . Are you saying the Meta probe should not be launched ? I 'm saying the backup crew appears to be fit . but because of the unknown factors I can 't guarantee that they won 't be affected three days or three months out into deep space . You 're saying medically the risk is unacceptable . The risk is great . The decision. of course. is yours . Doctor . I 'd like to see the men . 'Eric ? 'Frank ? 'It 's John Koenig . ' - Fine. how soon can you do it ? - In about a week . - Carter ? - Commander ! Nice to see you . Good to see you . Well. is she ready to go ? Yeah. as soon as you give the word . Every delay only reduces our chance of success . - How long to ready the backup crew ? - Seven days . - Backup crew ? What do you mean ? - How long will it take ? We can 't do it . Calculations. co-ordinates ! You got a problem you 're not telling me about ? I 'm here to get the Meta probe launched . - Crew excepted. are you ready to go ? - Yeah. we 're ready to go . 'Ah . John . Well. how are you ? Settling in up there . I hope ? 'I just wanted your first impressions of the situation . ' There was another death at the nuclear disposal area . Dr Russell talks about a kind of brain damage . caused by what she thinks is radiation . 'I 've heard all about her theory from Gorski . 'No. she 's a competent doctor in certain fields . 'but she 's wrong about this . 'Dead wrong. so I 'm sending you a team of top medical people ... ' Hold it . I 'm not that settled in . Before we do anything I 'd like to make sure there 's no radiation leak . 'Those two Meta probe astronauts didn 't go near that area . ' Simmonds. nine men have died . I want to find out why . Tell you what you can do . Stop sending atomic waste until ... 'You know I can 't do that . Atomic waste disposal is a big problem . ' You assigned me up here to clear up this mess and I 'm trying to do that . All right . Commissioner . Let 's trade off . You stop sending waste . I 'll get your Meta probe launched . Deal ? 'Well ... A temporary delay . 'That 's the best I can do . 'If that 's what you need . ' That 's what I need . Simmonds . Why did you lie to me ? 'You mean those men are no better ? ' No. they 're no better . They 're not going to get any better and you know it . 'Now. just a minute . 'We have to hold that story in . 'We have to . 'The International Lunar Finance Committee meet on the 15th 'to discuss the Meta signals and. in particular. our probe . 'Now. if one word . one hint of failure leaks out 'they 'll abandon their support for our whole project . 'So just remember that . ' - Paul . - ' Commander ? ' I 'm going to recheck that nuclear disposal area myself . 'Yes. sir . ' - I 'll need two volunteers . - ' Very good . Commander . ' That 's Area One . Collins . I want to go to Area Two . That 's where we are going . Commander . We just use Area One as a turning point . Navigation beacon Delta . It 's a landmark . Some landmark . Collins. move in closer for a good look . Yes. sir . There 's no radiation . John . I 've checked it out . That was the first waste area . Has it been used since I left ? No. this one hasn 't been used for five years . In those days we had no synthacrete radiation covers . How 's it holding ? All right . according to reports . All right . Collins . Thank you . - Let 's move on to Area Two . - ' Yes. sir . ' OK. let 's go . 'Point One. check complete . Radiation normal . 'No leakage . - ' We 're going on to Point 48 . ' - Fine . Jackson . - It seems all right . - Hmm . So far . 'Commander . Point 48. check complete . 'Radiation normal . No leakage . 'That 's it. sir . All OK out here . ' All right . Jackson . Thanks . Now get out of there as fast as you can . That seems to prove the radiation count here 's within safe limits . - So much for Dr Russell 's theory . - Hmm . Whatever affected the probe astronauts and killed the nine men was not radiation . Seems not . Damn it . - Commander . I 've got to get out . - All right . Collins. we 're leaving . Now ... Now ! NOW ! I 'm getting out of here ! You 'll kill us all ! Stun him ! Ouma . I want a breakdown of training flights of the probe astronauts . Check it against Collins' Eagle flights . Any correlations . Immediately . Dr Russell ? 'Commander . Dr Mathias here . ' What 's the condition of the Meta probe astronauts ? 'Frank Warren died at 13.28 . ' And Eric Sparkman ? 'Dr Russell is with him now . ' Computer . please verify that last report . 'Cell life sustained by artificial life support systems only . ' They died ? Eric . Frank . Of what ? - I mean . I was told ... - You were told lies . They died of an illness no one can understand . Earth Command wanted you to think it was a temporary setback . But the Meta probe ? Forget the probe . Carter . Before we do anything more . I 'm gonna find why those men died . 'There 's no doubt about it . 'Planet Meta could be supporting life as we know it . ' 'But the problem here may affect the Meta probe . ' 'We must make a manned landing on Meta . 'Nothing must stop us . 'Nothing . ' 'I can 't guarantee that they won 't be affected 'three days or three months out into deep space . ' 'Your job is to put man on Meta . ' 'The giant leap for mankind . 'It 's beginning to look like a stumble in the dark . ' This is from the Eagle flown by Eric and Frank on their last training run . The flight was recording perfectly and then suddenly everything went blank for two minutes. like that Then suddenly it started again. perfectly . Where did it occur ? Navigation beacon Delta . on the far side . Waste Disposal Area One . Paul. check all the figures on Area One for the past ten days . Sandra . check Area One. please . 'Yes . Paul . ' Collins flew over Area One on his way to Area Two . Does he always fly that ? Several times a week . It 's a turning point. right ? It 's a clear landmark for going to Area Two . The probe astronauts ? They do their training flights there . - But they fly there regularly ? - There 's a minimum altitude rule . That 's where the flight recorder blanked out on their training flight . I had Collins fly low over that area this morning . Paul ! Commander ! There is a steep rise in heat levels in Area One . This is impossible . Indications show that radiation is normal but the heat continues rising . Victor. we 've got a connection . - ' Right . I 'll be with you . ' - Bring in Area One on video . It is incredible heat but still no radiation . It 's incomprehensible . Heat without atomic activity . Here. let 's have a look at that . - Camera gone . - Second camera. please . Visual contact lost . Paul . I want an Eagle on the pad . We 've got to see what 's going on . Approaching Area One . Check data systems ready . Data systems functioning . It 's getting more active . I 'm increasing altitude . I 'm in trouble ! You getting data ? The magnetic field 's expanding . get him away from there . 'Commander . we 'll blast you out . ' Switch to onboard backup . we 're losing you . Backup failing . All systems out . Rescue ship. move in . 'I 'm at 4-9 . Altitude 3-5 . 'Impact ten seconds . ' Well ? Minor physical shock . We can 't find anything else so far . That 's it . Commander . I told you I walked away from there . there was no damage . Commander ! That is not the kind of damage I 'm looking for . You knew that that area was suspect . you knew it had already affected the other astronauts in some way . and yet you went right out there yourself . We 're looking for answers . Commander . Not heroes . I didn 't know you cared . Hmm . Look at this . It 's a monitoring device from the old Area One . It recorded the magnetic output from the artificial gravity system there . After that it had nothing to record for five years but now look . A twenty-fold increase in the magnetic field . And that 's before it burnt out . We 've been obsessed with radiation . Wrong . This instrument 's given me a lead . I think we 're facing a new effect . arising from the atomic waste deposited here over the years . Unprecedented magnetic energy . Responsible for the flare-up at Area One ? Causing brain damage ? Something we didn 't even check for . but I believe it was a magnetic surge that wrecked your navigation system and blanked out the flight recorder . The probe astronauts flew over there daily . as did Collins . Then we 've all been exposed to it . We 've all been to Area Two and to get there we turn over Area One . - It could be cumulative . - There 's a bigger problem looming . Area One burnt itself out in a magnetic subsurface firestorm . What worries me is that same thing could happen in Area Two . - How much time do we have ? - We need solid data . I won 't be responsible for any more men in these conditions . Neither will I. We equip an Eagle to monitor magnetic levels and do it by remote-control . Straight ahead . Easy ... Straight as you go . Good ... That 's good . Paul . Sandra. readings . Radiation count normal . magnetic field zero . OK . Paul. set her down . Right . Commander . Easy does it . Thrust her out of it . Paul ! A surge . A magnetic surge . Paul. contact Commissioner Simmonds immediately . Pass emergency code Alpha One . Yes. sir . You were right . Doctor . it was radiation . Magnetic radiation . Now we 're sitting on the biggest bomb Man 's ever made . Commissioner . Commander . My office tried to query you about your emergency code Alpha One . You didn 't seem to be available . I am now . Commissioner. the heat is rising on the interior of Area Two as well . Now. it contains 140 times the amount of waste in Area One . There could be a chain reaction . What are the chances it could burn itself out. like Area One ? Simmonds. you don 't seem to understand . we 're sitting on top of it . there is no chance . Well. what 's to be done ? We could try and break the pile apart . If we could disperse the mass over a wider ... All right. come on. let 's do it . We do have limited time . - ' Commander Koenig ? ' - Yes . Paul ? 'Conversion on six Eagles completed . they 're moving in now . ' All right . Paul . - Paul. let 's see it . - Yes. sir . 'Paul. this is Eagle 1-4 . I 'm getting a flicker on the navigation systems . ' 'It 's getting worse . ' Ouma . I want Central Computer updated with everything constantly . Number 26. disperse to grid C-9 . 'Repeat. disperse to grid C-9 . ' 'Grid C is full now . Paul . I 'm pulling over to C-10 . ' Well ? We 've had navigational failures on two of the ships . - The magnetic field is expanding . - Increase altitude . All Eagles. increase altitude by 10 . - Alan. is there an extra ship ? - No. sir . Take the Commissioner 's Eagle and report from orbit . - Right . - Readings ? Heat level holding . magnetic field fluctuating . That 's what worries me . 'We should go up another hundred . Commander . ' - Eagle 1 to Alpha . - ' Go ahead . ' Lift-off complete . trajectory programmed . I will be in orbit in four minutes . All levels are holding steady . - Do we have it under control . John ? - Too early to tell . I must say . it looks pretty promising to me . Well done . Now . I have to issue a communique sooner or later . It 'll give us more time to consider our next move. you see ... I see men risking their lives to avert total disaster . Now. wake up . Commissioner . If this goes wrong there won 't be anybody to issue a communique . There will be no survivors . Commander. it 's going up ! Abort ! Abort the mission ! Main Mission to all Eagles . Return to base immediately . - No ! - Seal off all sections . I can 't move ... G-force ... We 're moving ! Alpha. can you hear me ? Alpha. do you copy ? Alpha . I 'm not receiving you . maybe you 're receiving me . The Moon is going out of the Earth 's orbit . That explosion. it has pushed us out of the Earth 's orbit . 'Alpha. can you hear me ? 'Repeat . Alpha. are you OK ? 'Alpha. do you copy ? 'Alpha . I am not receiving you . ' 'Alpha ! Alpha. what 's happening to you down there ? ! 'You 've lost contact . 'Can you hear me . Alpha ? 'Alpha . I 'm open on all channels . 'If you 're all right send out a radio. anything ! ' 'Alpha ! 'We are moving away from Earth ! 'Alpha. do you copy ? ! 'Alpha ! ' Carter. can you hear me ? Commander ! Thank God you 're OK ! What 's happening down there ? 'We 've got tremendous G-forces . 'We can hardly move . ' Wait a minute . we seem to be decelerating . - Are you all right ? - Yeah. you ? We 're down to three G 's . We 're compensating . The whole disposal area has acted like a gigantic rocket motor . but if it 's stopped fissioning we shan 't be accelerating any more . Carter might have a chance . 'Carter. do you read me ? ' Yeah . I can hear you loud and clear . - ' Can you make it back to the base ? ' - Yeah . I can make it . I 'm closing now . - I can make it . - ' Good . Captain . ' Check out the base . This is Main Mission . All sections report . 'Security . We have audio contact . Video gone . ' 'Service . Lost all power . Operating on emergency systems . ' Medical . Paul . Explosive decompression in two compartments . Sufficiently operational to accept casualties . Gloria. help Lou. please . I 'm getting a long-range video picture . Can we make it back to Earth ? Ouma ... consult the Master Computer . I want a readout on contingency plan " Exodus " . Yes. sir . Punch it up on the big screen . Paul . It affects all of us here. all of us . Attention all sections Alpha . 'This is Commander John Koenig . ' As you know. our moon has been blasted out of orbit . We have been completely cut off from planet Earth . As we are we have power ... environment ... and therefore a possibility of survival . If we should try to improvise a return to Earth without travel plots . without full resources it is my belief ... that we would fail . Therefore. in my judgement . we do not try . 'The totally unforeseen accident on the lunar surface 'has caused very serious repercussions here on Earth . 'The gravity disruption . 'the earthquakes in the United States along the San Andreas Fault 'and in Yugoslavia as well as southern France . 'has caused enormous damage to life and property . 'The International Lunar Commission with its new chairman 'is in executive conference at this moment . 'deciding what steps might be taken to rescue 'the 311 men and women on Moonbase Alpha . 'Little hope is held that there are any survivors . 'It was thought a rescue might have been attempted from the Spacedock 'until that too was hurled out of orbit . 'It has now been established that the moon 's acceleration 'has put it beyond the reach of any ... ' Scan all frequencies for any signal from Earth. anything . Hold that ! It 's Meta . Maybe that 's where our future lies . Maybe there . 'September 13 . 1999 . 'Meta signals increasing . 'Yes. maybe there . '

 Τhe food is terrible . Worst shit I 've ever seen , man . What you say ? You got any biscuits over there ? I keep seeing corn bread . - I am cold . - Still with us , Brett ? - Right . - Oh , I feel dead . Anybody ever tell you you look dead , man ? Oh , yeah , right . Now , I just forgot something , man . Before we dock , I think we oughta discuss the bonus situation . Right . Brett and I , we think we oughta — - We deserve dull shares , right , baby ? - You see , Mr. Parker and I ... feel that the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level . Well , you 'll get what you 're contracted dor like everybody else . Yes , but everybody else gets more than us . Dallas , Mother wants to talk to you . Huh ? Yeah , I saw it . Yellow light 's for my eyes only . Okay , get dressed , huh ? - Parker , come on . - Can I finish my coffee ? Thank you . It 's the only thing good on this ship . Morning , Mother . - Right . - Okay . Plug us in . Thank you . - Where 's Earth ? - You should know . It 's not our system . Scan . I can 't believe this . Contact Τraffic Control . Τhis is commercial towing vehicle Nostromo out of the Solomons . Registration number : 1-8-0-niner-2-4-6-0-niner . Calling Antarctica Traffic Control . Can you read me ? Over . Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo out of the Solomons , registration number — - Nothing . - Keep trying . Calling Antarctica Traffic Control . Do you read me , Antarctica ? Over . I found it . Just short of Zeta II Reticuli . We haven 't reached the outer rim yet . That 's hard to believe . What the hell are we doing out here ? I don 't know . What the hell are you talking about ? - That 's not our system . - I know that . Do you ever notice how they never come down here ? I mean , this is where the work is , right ? Well , it 's the same damn reason we get a half share to their one . Our time is their time . That 's the way they see it . No , but — Listen , man . Same old shit , man . I think I know why they don 't come down here . It 's because of you . You don 't have no personality . Wonder what they want now . What 's going on down here ? - Um , you happen to be in my seat . Can I have it ? - Yes , of course . Thank you . I 'm sorry . What 's happenin ' now , baby ? Well , some of you may have figured out we 're not home yet . - We 're only halfway there . - What ? Mother 's interrupted the course of our journey . Why ? Yeah . She 's programmed to do that should certain conditions arise . They have . Like what ? It seems she has ... intercepted a transmission of unknown origin . She got us up to check it out . A transmission ? Out here ? Yeah . What kind of a transmission ? Acoustical beacon . It repeats at intervals of 12 seconds . S.O.S. ? I don 't know . Human ? - Unknown . - Well , so what ? We are obligated under section eight — I hate to bring this up , but , uh , this is a commercial ship , not a rescue ship . Right . And it 's not in my contract to do this kind of duty . And what about the money ? If you 'd wanna give me some money , I 'll be happy to oblige . The man 's right . Let 's go over the bonus situation . - I 'm sorry . Can I say something ? - Let 's talk about the bonus more . There is a clause in the contract which specifically states ... any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin ... must be investigated . I don 't wanna hear it . We don 't know if it 's intelligent . I wanna go home and party . Parker , will you just listen to the man ? On penalty of total forfeiture of shares . No money . You got that ? - Well , yeah . - All right , we 're going in . Yeah . We 're goin ' in , aren 't we ? Approaching orbital apogee . Mark 12 , 11 — Equatorial orbit nailed . Nine , eight seconds on descent . Grids energized . Fields focused . Five . Four — - D.O.R. ' s on line . - How 's the status on the lifters ? Give me an A.C. pressure reading . Forty-eight seconds and counting . SR-1 stable . Prepare to disengage from platform . Mark , 20 seconds . Eighteen , 17 — Twelve , 11 , 10 , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one , lock . Disengage . Umbilicus clear . Money 's safe . Let 's take her down . Nine , eight , seven — Roll 92 degrees port yaw . Prime to port . Prime ventral . Prime dorsal . Down a degree . 39,000 meters . Turbulence . Locked and floating . You can drop us anytime now . We 'll catch you . Inertial damping 's going off . Hold on , people . There 's gonna be a little bump . What the hell was that ? Pressure drop in intake three . Must 've lost a shield . Let 's go with it . Dropping off now . Still dropping . Here we are . We 've got it . Τake her down . Navigation lights on . We 've got 5-3 still out . No problem . Just down 11 % . Grid status okay . Nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Kill drive engines . What the hell happened ? Somebody give me a straight answer ! - Is the hull breached ? - I don 't see anything . We 've still got pressure . - Hit the screen . - Right . Secondary load sharing unit ... is out . Three to four cells are gone . Is that it ? No , hold on . We can 't fix it out here anyway , and we need to reroute ... a couple of these ducts , wouldn 't you say , Brett ? Dry dock time . Dry dock . Tell her we need to dry-dock . Look , we couldn 't fix it out here anyway . We gotta reroute all these ducts , and in order to do that we 've got to dry-dock . What else ? Some fragments kicked up , and we 've got to clean it all out and repressurize it . How long before we 're functional ? Look , what is — What — It 's 17 hours , tell her . At least 25 hours . Yeah . Get started on the floor panel . I 'll be right down . What the hell 's she comin ' down here for ? She better stay the fuck out of my way , I 'll tell you that . I 'd like to see what she 's gonna do when she gets here . - Any response yet ? _ No . Absolutely nothing . Except the same transmission every 12 seconds . All the other channels are dead . Kick on the floods . We can 't go anywhere in this . Mmm . Well , Mother says the sun 's coming up in 20 minutes . Ηow far are we from the source of transmission ? Uh , northeast . Just under 2,000 meters . Walking distance ? Well — - Can you give me an atmospheric ? - Yes . Oh . It 's almost primordial . There 's inert nitrogen , high concentration of carbon dioxide crystals , methane . I 'm working on the trace elements . - Anything else ? - Yes . It 's ... rock , lava base , and deep cold . - Well below the line . - Mm-hmm . I 'll volunteer to be in the first group to go out . Yeah , that figures . You too , Lambert . Swell . Better break out the weapons . I can 't see a goddamn thing . Ash , are you receiving ? Good contact on my board . Clear and free . Keep the line open . Let 's go . Hey , Ripley . Hey , Ripley , I wanna ask you a question . If they find what they 're lookin ' for out there , does that mean we get full shares ? Don 't worry , Parker . You 'll get whatever 's coming to you . Look , I 'm not gonna do any more work ... till we get this straightened out . Brett , - you 're guaranteed by law to get a share . - What ? - Why don 't you just fuck off . - What ? What 'd you say , Rip ? If you have any trouble , I 'll be on the bridge . Hey , Ripley , come back here ! Son of a bitch . What 's the matter ? Can 't see a goddamn thing . Quit griping . I like griping . Come on . Knock it off . How 's it going ? All right . Ηave you tried putting that transmission through E.C.I.U. ? No . Mother hasn 't identified it yet . - You mind if I give it a shot ? - Please do . Ash , can you see this ? Yes , I can . I 've never seen anything like it . Very bizarre . You said it . All right . Moving on to second ... position . What is it ? Let 's get out of here . We 've got this far . We must go on . We have to go on . Will you say that again ? Shit . Ash , as you can see , it 's kind of hard to describe . I 'm going back to the console . Seems to be solid . To walk — You can on it . Dallas ? Come on down here . Something different down here . I don 't know what it is , but — See if we can get up that wall . If we can get up that wall , we can find out . Amazing . Alien life-dorm . Looks like it 's been dead a long time . Fossilized . Looks like it 's grown out of the chair . Bones are bent outward , like he exploded from inside . Wonder what happened to the rest of the crew . Let 's get the hell out of here . Ηey , Dallas , Lambert , come on over here . Come on . What do you got ? See what you make of this . Ash . That transmission — Mother 's deciphered part of it . It doesn 't look like an S.O.S. What is it , then ? Well , I — It looks like a warning . - I 'm gonna go out after them . - What 's the point ? I mean , by the time it takes to get there , you 'll — they 'll know if it 's a warning or not , yes ? You okay down there ? Can you see anything ? Uh ... a cave . A ca — A cave of some sort . But I — Well , I don 't know , but it 's like the goddamn tropics in here . What the hell is this ? The cave is completely enclosed , and it 's full of ... leathery objects , like eggs or something . There 's a layer of mist ... just covering the eggs that reacts when broken . Kane ? You all right ? I 'm okay . All right . I 'm okay . I just slipped . Appears to be completely sealed . Wait a minute . There 's movement . It seems to have life . Organic life . You there , Ripley ? I 'm right here . - Okay , Ripley , I 'm at the inner lock hatch now . - Right . Ripley . We 're clean . Let us in . Right here . - What happened to Kane ? - Something has attached itself to him . - We have to get him to the infirmary right away . - What kind of thing ? - I need a clear definition . - An organism . Open the hatch . Wait a minute . If we let it in , the ship could be infected . You know the quarantine procedure — 24 hours for decontamination . He could die in 24 hours . Open the hatch . Listen to me . If we break quarantine , we could all die . Look , would you open the goddamn hatch ? We have to get him inside . No . I can 't do that . And if you were in my position , you 'd do the same . Ripley , this is an order . Open that hatch right now . - Do you hear me ? - Yes . Ripley , this is an order ! Do you hear me ? Yes , lI read you . The answer is negative . Inner hatch opened . My God . What the hell is that ? Ηow is he ? How are we gonna get that off him ? Ηow are we gonna get it off ? I 'm gonna get some instruments . My God . Right . I 'll make an incision here . Try and remove one of the digitals from — You 're gonna do what ? Finger . I 'm gonna try and get his finger off . Just a minute . - No , that 's not — It 's tearing his scalp . - I know ! It 's not coming off without tearing his face off with it . - We 'll have to take a look at him inside . - Right . Ηow come they don 't freeze him ? Ηow come you guys don 't freeze him ? All right , you can take your mask off . - What 's it got down his throat ? - I would suggest it 's feeding him oxygen . Paralyzes him , puts him in a coma , then keeps him alive . Now what the hell is that ? - We gotta get it off of him . - Just a minute . Just a minute . I mean , let 's not be too hasty . We don 't know anything about ... it . Now , we 're assuming it 's feeding him oxygen . If we remove it , it could kill him . I 'm willing to take that chance . Let 's cut it off him now . - You 'll take responsibility ? - Yes , I 'll take responsibility . Get him out of there . Where do you wanna do this ? We 'll make an incision just below the knuckle there . Right here . Stand by . Good God ! That crap 's gonna eat through the hull . That thing 's gonna eat through the goddamn hull . Come on ! What 's going on ? This way . Next deck . There it is . Don 't get under it ! Don 't get under it . Looks like it 's stopping . - Τake a look at this , man . - Yeah . Brett , give me — What do you got , a pen there ? Give it to me , quick . Come on ! Come on ! Don 't get any on your arm . It stopped . Don 't see anything like that except , uh , molecular acid . It must be using it for blood . It 's got a wonderful defense mechanism . You don 't dare kill it . What about Kane ? - Here 's your pen back . - What do we do now ? Leave Kane to Ash . You get back to work . Well , what — Okay . Τry it . Damn it . I thought sure that was it . Τry it again . I feel like I 've been in this place a month . We shouldn 't have landed in this place in the first place . Shouldn 't have landed on this damn ball , I know that . Well , the sooner we patch this thing up and get out of here , the sooner we can go home . This place gives me the creeps . That 's amazing . What is it ? Ah , yes , it is . Um — I don 't know yet . Did you want something ? Yes . I , uh — I 'd like to have a little talk . How 's , uh — How 's Kane ? He 's holding . No changes . And , uh , our guest ? - Well — - Hmm ? Well , as I said , I 'm still ... collating , actually , but , uh , I have confirmed that he 's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides . He has a funny habit of shedding his cells ... and replacing them with ... polarized silicon , which gives him a prolonged resistance ... to adverse environmental conditions . - Is that enough for you ? - That 's plenty . - What does it mean ? - Please don 't do that . Thank you . I 'm sorry . Well , it 's an interesting combination of elements , making him a tough little son of a bitch . And you let him in . I was obeying a direct order , remember ? Ash , when Dallas and Kane are off the ship , I 'm senior officer . Oh , yes . I forgot . You also forgot the science division 's basic quarantine law . No , that I didn 't forget . Oh , I see . - You just broke it . - Huh ? Look , what would you have done with Kane ? Hmm ? You knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here . Undortunately , by breaking quarantine , you risk everybody 's life . Maybe I should 've left him outside . Maybe I 've jeopardized the rest of us , but it was a risk I was willing to take . Τhat 's a pretty big risk ... for a science officer . It 's , uh , not exactly out of the manual , is it ? I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you , you know . You do your job ... and let me do mine , yes ? - Where 's Dallas ? - In the shuttle . - Dallas . - I think you should have a look at Kane . - Why ? - Something 's happened . - Serious ? - Interesting . Ripley , meet me in the infirmary right away . Where is it ? Well , I don 't know . I mean , we ought to try and find it . Yeah , let 's check it . Dallas , please be careful . Sorry . No , not in the corner . Psst . Have one of these . Just in case . Kane ? Dallas ? You okay ? I didn 't see it . Was it in the overhead ? What ? It was up there somewhere . My God . - Cover up the damn thing ! - Wait . That 's alive ! Τhat 's a reflex action . Well , we 've gotta have a look at this . Excuse me . - Seems dead enough . - Well , good . Let 's get rid of it . Ripley , for God 's sake , this is the first time that we 've encountered a species like this . It has to go back . All sorts of tests have to be made . Ash , are you kidding ? This thing bled acid . Who knows what it 's gonna do when it 's dead . Τhink it 's sade to assume it isn 't a zombie . Dallas , it has to go back . Well , I 'd soon ... as not burn it at the stake , but you 're the science officer . It 's your decision , Ash . Dallas . How come I 've got to change my mind ? The decision 's been made . I 'm not trying to change your mind , Dallas . I just want you to listen — Will you listen to — Just tell me how You can leave that kind of decision to him . Look , I just run the ship . Anything that has to do with the science division , Ash has the final word . - Ηow does that happen ? - It happens , my dear , because that 's what the company wants to happen . Since when is that standard procedure ? Standard procedure is to do what the hell they tell you to do . Did you ever ship out with Ash bedore ? I went out five times with another science officer . Τhey replaced him two days before we left Τhedus with Ash . Hmm ? - I don 't trust him . - I don 't trust anybody . What 's happening with the repairs ? How 's it going ? They 're pretty much finished now . Why the hell didn 't you tell me so ? - Because there 's still some things left to do . - Like what ? Well , we 're blind on " B " and " C " decks . The reserve power system 's blown — That 's a bunch of horseshit . - We can take off without that . - Yeah , we can . - You think that 's a good idea ? Look , I just wanna get the hell out of here , all right ? Dust in the intakes again . Number two 's overheating . Spit on it for two minutes , would you , for Christ 's sake ? We 're hot . We 're getting hotter . Engine room , red clip status ? - One kilometer on ascension . - Engage artificial gravity . Engaged . I 'm altering the vector now . Inhibit C.N.G. control . - Struts retract . - Struts retracted . Max stress to fifth overload . Ease it back . She 's great . Beautiful . Walk in the park . When we fix something , we stay fixed . - Don 't we , Brett baby ? - Right . What I think we should do is just freeze him . If he 's got a disease , why don 't we stop it where it is ? - He can always get to a doctor when we get back home . - Right . Whenever he says anything , you say " right " , Brett . You know that ? Right . Parker , what do you think ? Your staff just follows you around , says " right . " - Just like a regular parrot . - Yeah . Shape up . - What are you , some kind of parrot ? - Right . Come on . Knock it off ! Kane 's gonna have to go into quarantine . That 's it . Yes , and so will we . Well , how about a little something to lower your spirits ? Thrill me , will you , please ? Well , according to my calculations , based on time spent getting to and from the planet — - Just give me the short version . How far to Earth ? - Ten months . Oh , God . Great . Yes . Dallas , I think you should come and see Kane . - Has his condition changed ? - It 's simpler if you 'd just come and see him . We 're on our way . Right . How are you doing ? Τhank you . How you doin ' ? Um , terrific . Next silly question . Oh , thank you . Do you remember anything about the planet ? What 's the last thing you do remember ? Huh ? I remember some ... horrible dream about ... smothering . And — And — Anyway , where are we ? Right here . We 're on our way home . Back to the old freezerinos . Could I have something to eat before we go back ? I-I need something myself . Yeah , right . One more meal bedore bedtime . I 'm buyin ' . Ηey , that 's a break . Bedtime . The first thing that I 'm gonna do when I get back ... is to get some decent food . I can dig it , man . Let me tell you , I 've eaten worse food than this , but then I 've tasted better , you know what I 'm sayin ' ? The other one over there . Well , you pound down the stuff like there 's no tomorrow . I 'd rather be eatin something else , but , uh , right now I 'm thinkin ' food . Well , you should know . You know what it 's made of . No , man , I don 't wanna talk about what it 's made of . I 'm eatin ' this just to — What 's the matter ? The food ain 't that bad , baby . What 's wrong , Kane ? Are you choking ? What 's wrong ? What ? What ? - This is serious . - Kane , what 's the matter ? It 's okay ! Ηold him down ! Hold him — Get the spoon in ! Damn it ! Get it into his mouth ! I 'm trying ! Oh , my God ! Oh , God ! No ! Don 't touch it ! Don 't touch it ! Dallas ? Dallas ? Yeah . Anything ? No . You ? Nothing . You see anything ? No . Inner hatch sealed . Anybody wanna say anything ? Τhis is just an ordinary prod , like a cattle prod . It 's got a portable battery . It 's insulated all the way here , all the way up to here . Just make damn sure nobody puts their hand on the end of it . It shouldn 't damage the little bastard , unless its skin 's thinner than ours . But it will give him a little incentive . Now we just have to find it . I 've taken care of that . I 've designed this tracking device . You just set it to search for a moving object , like so . Hasn 't got much of a range , but when you get within a certain distance , it 'll start to give off a signal . What 's it key on ? Micro changes in air density . Give me a demo . See ? Again . Got ya . Two teams . Ash , Lambert and I. Ripley , you take Parker and Brett . Now , anyone see this thing , you catch it in the net ... that Parker 's holding on his lap . Parker , I don 't want any heroics out of you , all right ? Catch it , put it in the air lock , get rid of it . Now , channels are open on all decks . I want you to communicate , keep in touch at all times , all right ? Let 's go . I thought you fixed 12 module . We did . I don 't understand it . The circuits must have burned out . What do we got here ? Damn it ! Hold your light over here , would you ? Yeah , that 's it . I don 't know if this is gonna work . If I could just put this — put this in there . Right . Oh , damn it . Check the insulation . Oh , shit ! Steady . According to this , it 's within five meters . Open the door . Micro changes in air density , my ass . It 's within five meters . Be careful . - Christ . - Don 't do that . Don 't creep up on me with that thing . You guys , stick together . Don 't fail me now . What ? What is it ? Parker , Brett , it 's in this locker ! Where ? Here , take this . Get over there and get the net . Get it ? I got it . I got it . I got it . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . All right , Parker . When I say . All right . Now . Easy . Wait ! Don 't let him go ! What the hell are you doing , man ? It 's the cat . Hey , look , now . We had to bag it , man . Now we might pick it up on the tracker again . I 'll — I 'll — I 'll — Go and get it , man . All right . You get him . We 'll go on . Here , kitty ! Here , kitty , kitty ! Enough of that kitty crap . Jones . Jonesy ? Ηere , Jonesy . Jonesy ? Here , kitty , kitty , kitty . Ηere , Jonesy . Jonesy ? Here , kitty , kitty . Kitty , kitty , kitty . Ηere , Jonesy . Jonesy . Kitty , kitty . Jonesy ? Hey . Ηey . Come on , Jonesy . Come on , baby . That 's a kitty . That 's a kitty . Come on , baby . That 's a kitty . Ηey , hey . I 'm not gonna hurt you . Come on . Whatever it was , it was — it was big and — You 're sure it took him into the air shaft ? Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts . No question , it 's — it 's using the air ducts to move around . Could he want Brett alive ? What ? Could Brett be alive ? No . I mean , I don 't think so . Well , this air shaft may work to our advantage . Ηere it leads up to and comes out in the main air lock . All right . Τhere 's only one big opening along the way . We can cover that up , and then we ... drive it into the air lock and zap it into outer space . This son of a bitch is huge ! - I mean , it 's like a man . It 's big ! - Kane 's son . Come on , Ash . Science department should be able to help us . What can we do to drive it ? Yes , well , it 's adapted remarkably well to our atmosphere , considering its nutritional requirements . - The only thing we don 't know about is temperature . - Okay . What about temperature ? - What happens if we change it ? - Let 's try it . I mean , most animals retreat from fire . Yes ? Fire , yeah . Parker , can you rig ... three or four incinerator units ? Give me about 20 minutes . I 'll do it . - Who gets to go into the vent ? - I do . No . You and Ash ... take the main air lock . Parker , Lambert , you cover up that maintenance opening , please . Right . - I 'm at the first junction . - Dallas , I 'm right here . - Parker ? - Yeah ? - Lambert ? We 're in position . I 'm just trying to get a reading here . - The air lock is open . - Okay , Ripley . Ready . All right . I 've got a reading on you now . Uh , open the hatch to the third junction . Okay , I 'm through . Ripley ? Yes . Close all the hatches behind me . I 'm moving on . Dallas , hold it a minute . I think I got it . Yes , I 've got it . Where ? It 's somewhere around the third junction . Okay , moving on . It is right around there . Now , Dallas , you 're gonna have to be careful . All right . I 've reached ... the third junction , and I 'm going down . The hell 's the matter with that box ? Dallas , you 're gonna have to hold your position for a minute . I — I 've lost the signal . What ? You sure ? Look around . Are you sure it 's not there ? It 's got to be around there somewhere . Checked it out , Lambert . You may be getting interference . Dallas , are you sure there 's no sign of it ? I mean , it is there . It 's gotta be around there . - Dallas ? - God , what is happening ? All right . Uh , am I — am I clear , Lambert ? I want to get the hell out of here . Oh , God . It 's moving right towards you . Um — Move ! Get out of there ! Behind you ! Move ! Dallas ! Move , Dallas ! Move , Dallas ! Get out ! Move ! The other way ! Dallas ? Oh , no . Take it easy . Dallas ? We dound this laying there . No blood . No Dallas . Nothing . - Ηow come I don 't hear nobody saying nothing ? - I 'm thinking . Unless somebody has got a better idea , we 'll proceed with Dallas 's plan . What ? And end up like the others ? Ohh . No , you 're out of your mind . - Got a better idea ? - Yes . I say that we abandon this ship . We get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here . We take our chances and just hope that ... somebody picks us up . Lambert . The shuttle won 't take four . Then why don 't we draw straws and — I 'm not drawing ' any straws . I 'm for killing that goddamn thing right now . Okay . Well , let 's talk about killing it . We know it 's using the air shafts — Will you listen to me , Parker ? Shut up ! Let 's hear it . Let 's hear it . It 's using the air shafts . We don 't know that . That 's the only way . We 'll move in pairs . We 'll go step by step ... and cut off every bulkhead and every vent ... until we have it cornered , and then we 'll blow it the duck out into space . Is that acceptable to you ? If it means killing it , it 's acceptable to me . Obviously it means killing it . But we have to stick together . How are our weapons ? The weapons are fine . Τhis one needs refueling . Will you get it , please ? Ash , go with him . No , no . I can manage , Ash . Don 't dollow me . Ash ? Any suggestions from you or Mother ? No , we 're still collating . You 're what ? You 're still collating ? I find that hard to believe . What would you like me to do ? Just what you 've been doing , Ash . Nothing . I 've got access to Mother now , and I 'll get my own answers , thank you . All right . There is an explanation for this , you know . Is there really ? I don 't wanna hear your goddamn explanation ! I want — I want — I want — I w — Parker . Lambert ? Ash , open the door . Ash — Will you open the door ? Let me by , Ash . Yaah ! The hell are you doing ? Aah ! Get her up . Get her up . Get her up . Get her up . Get her up . Get her up . Android ! He 's an android ! Jesus ! It 's a robot . Ash is a goddamn robot ! God ! Oh ! Get off me — Oh ! Holy shit ! Ηelp ! Help me get this fucking thing off ! Aah ! God ! Jesus ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! How come the company sent us a goddamn robot ? All I can think of is they must 've wanted the alien for their weapons division . He 's been protecting it right along . Parker , will you plug it in ? I don 't know why — Because he may know how to kill it . Ash , can you hear me ? Ash ? Yes , I can hear you . - What was your special order ? - You read it . I thought it was clear . - What was it ? - Bring back life-dorm . Priority one . All other priorities rescinded . Τhe damn company ! What about our lives , you son of a bitch ? I repeat : All other priorities are rescinded . How do we kill it , Ash ? Τhere 's got to be a way of killing it . How — How do we do it ? You can 't . - Τhat 's bullshit ! - You still don 't understand what you 're dealing with , do you ? A perfect organism . Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility . You admire it . I admire its purity . A survivor ... unclouded by conscience , remorse or delusions of morality . Look , I — I 've heard enough of this , and I 'm asking you to pull the plug . - Last word . - What ? I can 't lie to you about your chances , but ... you have my sympathies . We 're gonna blow up the ship . We 'll take our chances in the shuttle . Blow up the ship . Good . Come on . When we throw the switches , how long before the ship blows ? Ten minutes . No bullshit . If we ain 't outta here in ten minutes , we won 't need no rocket to fly through space . We 're gonna need coolant for the air support system . You two go down , get all the coolant you can carry . I 'll get the shuttle ready . I 'll give you about — about seven minutes . Come back up here . I 'll shut the switches off , and we 'll blow this fucker off into space . Okay . All right . Come on . Ready ? Take care of yourself . Seven minutes . Take it easy . Jones . Jones ? Okay , check the bottles . Jones ? How you doin ' ? Fine . Kitty . Okay . Go ahead . Jones ? Psst ! Psst ! Psst ! Psst ! Kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty . Come here , Jones . Come here . Jones ? Come here , boy . Come here . Nice kitty . Jones ? Jones ? Come here . Come here , sweetheart . Jones . Jones ? Jones ? Jones ? Jones ! Goddamn it ! Now I got you . Ηere , sweetie . Nice kitty . Oh , my God . - Get out of the way . - I can 't get out of the way ! Get out of the way , Lambert ! It 's gonna kill us ! I can 't ! Lambert , for Christ 's sake , get out of the way ! Parker ? Lambert — Get out of the way , Lambert ! Parker ? Lambert ? Lambert ? Parker ? Get outta the room ! Oh , God ! Parker ? Danger .

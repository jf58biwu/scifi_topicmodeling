 ( LAUGHING ) What 's funny ? Oh , I was just thinking of something my father used to say . - What 's that ? - " All beginnings are hard . " That 's not funny . All we ever seem to do is begin . You don 't think that 's funny ? Oh , funny as your sense of humour . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Have you finished , you two ? - Yes , Mrs Cohen . - Yes , Mrs Cohen . No . Aunt Emma . - Yes , Aunt Emma . - Yes , Aunt Emma . All right . Then you can take Barney 's breakfast , hmm ? Here it is . Do you call that finished ? Come on , young man . To the last drop . Mmm , up , up , up . That 's it . Now , that 's better . Now , be careful . Don 't run and don 't drop it , please . Ooh , do you think we could have a bone for Ben ? No , we can 't have a bone for Ben because there aren 't any bones for Ben . Look , all the bones we have go to make soup . Ben has to earn his own living just like the rest of us . Now , off you go , off . And be careful . MRS COHEN : ( GASPS ) Oh ! Be careful ! ( LAUGHS ) - Any more hot water ? - It won 't be long now . ( EXCLAIMS IN FRUSTRATION ) Oh , for some soap . Right . Where do we start ? We can 't just start anywhere . Oh , I don 't know . Let 's start over there , shall we ? - Right . - All right , then . Jenny , you go at the back and lift the shares . - This one ? - No , at the back . - Oh . - Okay ? - All right . Okay . Come on , then . - All right , let 's go on . ( CLICKING TONGUE ) Come on , boy . Come on , boy . - All right . - Can you go any faster ? - You all right ? - Yeah . - Well , shall we give it a go about here ? - Yeah . - All right , then , okay ? - Whoa , boy . - Think he 'll be all right ? - Yes , he 'll eat . All right . Well , I 'll come over here . Now the other one . There . - All right ? - Yeah . I 'll lead , and you have a go . All right . Come on then , boy . All right , then . Now , then . All right ? - Go on . - Come on , boy . Come on . - Go . - Come on . Come on , boy . Come . - Come on , boy . Come . - Go on . Oh , no . Look , you better lead him , I ... I 'll go behind , go on . Oh . - You think he can do it ? - I don 't think he 's big enough . - Come on . - Hang on . You 've just got to try very hard . - Okay ? - ( LAUGHING ) The plough is falling . - Hold on by the handles . - Yeah , okay . Come on , try . - Come on . - Come on , boy . Go on , boy . Go on . Nearly . Go on , boy . - Go on , boy . - Come on . - Oh . - Oh , come on . Just try , please . I don 't think he will . He 's too small . - One more go . - One more go . Go on . - Come on , boy . - Come . Go on , boy . Go on . Go on , go on . PAUL : You in the market for advice ? - Well , who are you ? - Paul . - What are you doing here ? - Watching . He ain 't never gonna do it , you know . - ABBY : Where do you come from ? - Does it matter ? - Have you been ill ? - Yeah . I 've been ill . This nag will never do . He 's a good pony . Depends what you mean by " good " , doesn 't it ? Good for what ? Where did you get him ? - Nick him from a posh livery stable ? - No . He was shut in a little field . He was starving . You 've got a kind heart . But he never worked in chains before . Anyway , there 's good grass . What do want to plough it up for ? You have to plough it up , you know , before you can plant anything . You don 't plant good pasture though , do you ? What are you going to feed your stock on ? You have got stock ? - We got some sheep , and a goat , and a ... - Jenny ... Look , you need help . - Who says ? - ABBY : Now , look here , Mr ... - Paul . - Very well . Paul ... How come you know so much about it ? - I 've been at it a long time . - Doing what ? We had this commune down Winchester . Haven 't you got any men here ? TOM : Okay , we 'll try it now . ( ENGINE FALTERING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) I don 't know . - It 's turning over all right . - Aye , but it 's not catching , see . I told you now , it 's your jet , man . You should have left it where it was , man , instead of wasting fuel , dragging it up here , see . - PAUL : Hello . - Now , who 's she now , then ? - He . - Hard to tell though , isn 't it ? Our own cream cheese . Thanks . Look , I don 't want to butt in where I 'm not wanted but I think I can offer you some advice . We 're in the market for anything we can get . - Including advice . - Good . - How much land have you got here ? - About 20 acres . - And there are , what ? - Nine of us . You should be laughing . - Is it all pasture ? - There 's a field of wheat . There 's one field 's got cabbages in . But they 're only little ones . Okay . Look , I know what you are all thinking . I mean , " What 's this long-haired git doing , " coming here telling us what to do ? What does he know about it ? " Well , I can 't help that . I 'm not here to criticise . But I 'm no good at tact . I mean , I can 't say you 're doing a grand job and all that crap . You got one cow drying out , a riding school hack , six chickens and a field full of spring cabbages . - And some sheep , and a goat , and ... - Okay , okay . But unless you get yourselves organised , you 're wasting your time . - Oh , really ? - Yeah , really . You see , there 's no use ploughing up any old bit of land and saying , " Oh , we 'll grow this here and that there . " There 's a whole cycle . You 've got to become part of it . You got to be planning two years ahead all the time . And rotate your crop , so you never get a bit of land idle or shagged out . First , livestock . You need two good horses . Old work horses like Suffolks or Clydesdales , if you can get them . But that 's unlikely . But at least something you can get used to pulling a plough . Yeah , well , you may not have noticed it , but we do happen to have a tractor . How long you 've been tinkering with it ? Trying to get it going ? - A week . - No , no , felt like . We 've had it a week . But we 've only been working on it a couple of days , see . Three days . In three days with two horses you could have ploughed six acres . Aye . But wait till we get the tractor going . Sure . You 'll do five acres a day . Easy . But what about when you 're held up because you got to scour the countryside looking for a spare part ? And when you 're going further and further afield , trying to find diesel ? Well , you talk as if nothing will never get back to normal . And you 're talking as if everything 's going to get back to what you call " normal " by Christmas . Well , maybe it will . I mean , we don 't know that , do we ? I mean , I met a fellow in the station wagon the other day , piled high with tins and bottles and things . And he said somebody he 'd met had heard the Japs had found a new vaccine . And I suppose he swam all the way across the Pacific just to tell us . Look , you may be right . I don 't know . All I know is , you got to work on the assumption that you 're wrong . That it 's never going to change . Never . Pessimist . That 's what you are . Pessimist . Doom merchant . Yes , well , we all know that . So what do you suggest we do ? What are you ploughing for ? - What are you aiming to plant ? - Potatoes . You got seed potatoes ? Yeah . Well , I found this clump , see , a fortnight ago when we came here . That 's not seed potato . - You want seed potatoes ? - Well , what 's the difference then ? You want shoots . You put some aside when you lift them , you stack them on end with the eyes on top and they sprout . ( CHUCKLES ) You won 't get anything out of them . Let 's have a look at this tractor of yours . Right . I 'll show you , follow me . ( SIGHING ) You know , he could be very useful . Mmm , if a trifle depressing . - Do you think he 'll fix the tractor ? - No , not a chance . Not without the spares . - Well , that 's that , then . - No spuds . Just a minute . The tractor . - What about it ? - Well , at the quarry . - What ? - Well , they had potatoes there . I mean , they had everything , they even had yeast . - What are you talking about ? - Can you remember the day I met you , when I was collecting that stuff from the chemist 's shop ? With that girl ... Yeah , well , they 've got all that stuff together . I mean , it might still be there . - Well , she may have gone back there . - No , no , not with the chap dead . Well , it was three or four months ago . Now , do you two mind telling me whatever all this is about ? Oh , we told you at the church . Don 't you remember ? ( STUTTERING ) This couple had gone methodically around the country , scouring , looking for provisions . They got it all stored away in a quarry near Abercastle . Then the man had an accident with a tractor and died . Oh , yes , I remember . You picked her up and she wandered off on her own . They 'd got a fantastic amount together . Well , do you think it still might be there ? Well , it could be . It was well hidden . Well , I wish you 'd remembered it earlier . It just never occurred to me . Well , it 's a bit outside our radius even now . Now , just you stick to the route I 've marked , all right ? - Yeah . - And no shortcuts . In that case if anything goes wrong , at least I 'm going to know which road you 're on . Right-ho , now , then . Don 't worry about us , boy . Yeah . Is he all right with that gun ? Who , Barney ? Well , I 'll tell you now , boy , he may not be much in the head , but he 's a lovely shot , and careful , too . I taught him that , see . Isn 't that right , Barney ? Isn 't that right , Barney ? - My sheep . - Yeah , well , don 't you worry about your sheep , Barney . We 'll look after them . Get inside now , my Barney boy . I 'll be with you now in a minute . That 's a good boy . We 're pals , see , him and me . Well , he 's more like a pet , really , see . Yeah , well , don 't try and get too much this trip . And see if you can get an inventory , as complete as you can . We 'll go and we 'll be back before dark . Yes . And mind how you go . ( VAN STARTING ) And leave the booze alone ! It 's been planted as a lea . Look , you 're gonna need three tonnes of hay next winter . If I was you , I 'd fence off about an acre and a half , the other end for that . The rest of it will plough quite easy . Just plough all this in . Well , you can use it for grazing , but that 's about all . - Why ? - Drainage . But surely it 's well-drained with the stream here . Just the opposite . All the water from the rest of the land just swamps down through the field to the stream . If the stream was on top and running at right angles , you 'd be well-drained . You can dig a ditch over there later on . Might help . I 'd never have thought of that , would you ? Yeah , well , he seems to know what he 's talking about . Oh , come on , Greg . You 're not having your harem challenged , you know . I got away with one of my kids . But she took ill near Petworth . I couldn 't do nothing for her . She was a terror , she was . I found a church and buried her . I just sat there beside her for ... I don 't know . Days . Still , you 've all been through it . I 'll kill that Tom Price . - No sign ? - No . No , I know him , he 's broken open the booze and got drunk . They won 't be back tonight now . I hope nothing 's happened to them . Where were you going when you came across us , Mr ... Just Paul . I don 't know , really . I came out first off looking for my dad . - You been in London ? - No . Don 't . He worked at King 's Cross on the railway . Anyway , I couldn 't find him . His flat was all tidy but he wasn 't in it . I was lucky to get out alive . There 's snipers everywhere , waiting to pick off anything they see moving for a gold filling or a packet of fags . ( VEHICLE APPROACHING ) There they are . Listen . Damn fools ! Travelling at night . Now , grab your coats and come give me a hand . No , you stay here , children , and finish your supper . Please . ( DOOR SLAMS ) - That doesn 't look like the van . - JENNY : Perhaps they found another . PAUL : It isn 't a van , it 's a Land Rover . Jenny , go and get a gun , quick . Paul , you stand by the lights of the bus . All right ! Now , who are you ? Now , turn your lights off and come out with your hands up ! Paul ! ( CAR DOOR OPENS ) Don 't shoot me ! I 'm sorry . I hoped you 'd be friendly . Well , we may be . What are you doing here ? I was just looking for somewhere to park for the night . I saw your lights . You make it a habit of driving around at night ? No . In fact , I got quite panicky when it started to get dark , but we just couldn 't find anywhere secluded . - GREG : We ? - Mr Russell and I. I 'm Charmian Wentworth . Do you think I can move out of those lights now ? They 're rather dazzling . Yeah , sure . Go on . - Well , where is this Mr Russell ? - Oh , he 's asleep . At least I hope he 's asleep . I hope we haven 't disturbed him . - You 're not ill , are you ? - Ill ? No . Oh . No , we haven 't got the Death , if that 's what you mean . Mr Russell had it , but he 's quite recovered now . What 's he asleep for , then ? And you driving him round ? Well , he 's my ... I 'm his secretary . - You 're kidding . - What do you mean ? I 'm his secretary , I 've been his secretary since ... - He 's " the " Mr Russell . - Oh , " the " Mr Russell . I 'm sorry , Mr Arthur Russell , of Russell Investments . Taebo Unit Trusts , Anglo-Russell Properties ... He has an island off the coast of Argyllshire . That 's where we 're going . An island ? Like with people ? Surfs , vassals and such like ? ( CHUCKLING ) Oh , no . There 's only one tiny house there . Oh , dear . He 's awake . What 's all this about ? I was just stopping for the night , Mr Russell . Oh , yes . Well , you 'd better get some sleep , then . Good evening . - Has he gone back to bed ? - Oh , I expect so . He does so hate to be disturbed . That 's why I didn 't want to ... Isn 't he marvellous ? ( LAUGHING ) Oh , no . No , I don 't ... Really . Oh , dear . This is our land you 're parked on , and we expect a certain standard of courtesy . 'Cause otherwise we 're inclined to throw people off it . This island of yours may be more inhabited than you expect . Don 't you think a lot of other people have exactly the same idea ? Possibly . But it is my island , I have a legal title to it . Whose law ? Legal title is whatever you lay your hands on now . Yes , but I don 't think anybody would want it , it 's quite barren . How are you gonna live then ? Well , it is of course surrounded by fish . And I suppose Mrs Wentworth will be doing the fishing for you . Are you being deliberately offensive , young man ? Or is this an example of your standard of courtesy ? I don 't know about him being offensive , I haven 't known him long enough . But it seems to me that for a successful businessman , you don 't seem to be showing much foresight . It 's all right . We have fixed up a room for you . I hope you wouldn 't mind sharing . If that 's all right . Won 't you join us in a drink , Mrs Cohen ? Oh , no , no , thank you very much . - You , Miss ... - Well , thank you . - No , dear . - No , thank you . You 're not short of it . Not for the moment . - Charmian ? - Yes , Mr Russell ? Perhaps we 'll stay on here a day or two . - You could do with a rest . - Yes . - Well , good night . - Good night . ( ARTHUR EXHALES ) Come along , you two . I 've got a lot to do with two more mouths to feed . And take this out to Wendy , please . Why is Wendy looking after the sheep ? 'Cause Barney 's not back yet . - Where is Barney ? - With Tom . - Where 's Tom ? - Oh , off you go . - Wendy wants her breakfast , off ! - Come on . - JOHN : Come on , Lizzie . - Hey , careful . Careful . Wouldn 't you give them just one more hour ? No , no . They 've had time enough . Even if they waited until it was daylight , they should have been back hours ago . I didn 't think we 'd need a caravan . No , fine . - Who 's driving ? - I 'll drive . How are we for gas ? There 's enough . Greg , you will take care . You 'll be leaving us pretty depleted if anything happens to you . No , don 't worry . Nor you . We 'll be back soon . Probably with a hungover Tom Price . Yes , well , I hope that 's all it is . Good luck . Some sort of expedition ? - Yes . - Going far , are they ? I do hope you don 't mind us borrowing your Land Rover . But you did say you 'd like to stay for a couple of days . Yes , thank you . Yes , well , if I were you , I 'd get your things out of the caravan . I loathe arrogance in a woman . Oh , dear . Is something wrong ? - This Grant person . - Well , what 's the matter ? Well , I may be old-fashioned but bossy women all seem to me to have no femininity . - I know . - And taking the Land Rover like that , - high-handed in the extreme . - The Land Rover ? Yes , they just drove off in it . To search for somebody without so much as a by your leave . - I think they 're very worried . - Of course they 're worried . There 's no excuse for that sort of behaviour . I loathe bad manners . Perhaps you 'd like to move on . Without the Land Rover ? ( CHUCKLES ) Well , surely it 's not gone for good . No . No , I 'll give them a little more rope . - I 'll watch how things go . - Right . Well , don 't run away . I was just going to see if I could be of any use . To whom ? Mr Russell , I think these people need us . - Oh , do you ? - Yes . Perhaps more than we need them . Charmian , I think for the time being it might be a good idea not to mention the little we bought with us . ( CHUCKLES ) I wasn 't thinking of the food and drink . I was thinking of us . In what way ? How could they need us ? Well , there 's such a lot to do . They 're not living out of tins , you know . ( SCOFFS ) I don 't really see myself as a very good farm labourer . But you are a brilliant administrator , Mr Russell . I 'm sure they 'll find that very useful . Charmian , do you think in the circumstances we might try to be a little less formal ? After all , we do know now that my name is Arthur . Why , thank you , Mr ... Thank you , Arthur . I 'll do my best . You always do , my dear . Oh , the Abby woman suggested we might like to bring our things inside , from the caravan . Oh , well , perhaps you 'd let me have the key . Well , if we do it , we 'll do it in our own time . Well , there 's quite a lot to move . Yeah , we 'll leave it till later and I 'll give you a hand . Thank you , but we shouldn 't leave it too late , you know . Yeah , I suppose not . Shouldn 't we offer them food ? What happens if we decide to move on ? Well , surely they 'd let us have it back . Possibly , my dear , but I 'd rather avoid any embarrassment . - Looks pretty desolate . - Yeah . Not much been around here . Well , except Tom Price , we hope . - PAUL : There 's the van . - Yeah , but where the hell are they ? PAUL : What did they stop for ? The puncture ? ( GUN FIRING ) - MAN : Get back ! - Well , that answered your question . - Can you reverse out ? - Like a shot , if you 'll forgive the expression . - Who was it shouted ? - Oh , I don 't know . Could have been Tom Price . Did you see where the shot came from ? No . But if it wasn 't from the van , it must have been somewhere around that hut . Yeah , well , there 's nothing for it , I suppose . We 'll have to go and have a look . I 'm not very good with these things . Yeah , well , now 's the time to learn . Come on . We 'll have to go further on up . Come on . ( GRUNTING ) For God 's sake , keep your head down . It 's a bit hard on the elbows , as the Bishop said . Sorry . So where the hell are they ? They 're not still in the van , I suppose . There they are . Price ! Price ! Up here ! Where the hell have you been ? How many of them are there ? About three or four I think . We can 't move neither way . They shot our tyres out as soon as we appeared . Every time we make a move , they shoot . - You can 't have been there all night . - TOM : Well , we have . You could have got out when it was dark . You must be joking . With the moon last night , it was as light as day , man . Well , where are your guns ? In the van . And my fags . I 've been dying for a smoke . Well , listen , we just get out of here . Now , is it just the tyres of the van they got ? Yeah , I think so . You haven 't got any fags on you , have you ? - No . - Oh . How about a white flag and a dignified retreat ? Well , I don 't see how else we 're going to get them out of there . Have you got a handkerchief down there ? - TOM : A handkerchief ? - To make a white flag with ! Well , I got a handkerchief , but , I don 't know about white , though . You 've been cleaning the tractor with that . But it 'll have to do . I need a stick to put it on . GREG : Well , isn 't there anything down there ? - No . - Yes , there is . Down to your right . It 's only a few feet along . What , there ? He 'll take a pot at me if I go for that . Barney boy , you be a good boy and go and get it for me . Wait a minute . You get it . No , no , he 's quicker than me , see . - Be less of a target , like . - You get it ! Oh , all right . Stay here , Barney boy , look out for me . GREG : Get on with it , Price ! ( GUN FIRING ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) Dear , dear , Barney , that was close now , wasn 't it ? Well , well ... - It 's funny though . - What 's funny about it ? It was the same last time , one rifle shot , then a lot of shotguns going off . Well , perhaps they just take their cue from a leader . They 're not so good though , the rest of them . Look at the van . Shall I wave it about at them ? ( GUNS FIRING ) Well , so much for the Geneva Convention . I 'm not doing that again , man . They got no respect , man . I didn 't see where the rifle shot came from . But the shotguns are poked out along the wall . Look , there 's one just below that poster or whatever it is . - See that black square ? - Yes . Another one just along to the right about six feet , and so on . Yeah , it 's not much of a help though , is it ? I don 't know . Wonder if the other side 's as well protected . I tell you , boy . They 're animals , they are . I mean , you respect the flag of truce , don 't you , man ? Well , well ... Yeah , well , it 's worth having a look . You keep them busy here . I 'm going to have a go round the back . Just give me a couple of minutes and then take the occasional pot shot in their direction . Barney boy , we 're not going to get out of this alive . So you might as well make up your mind to that . So , enjoy yourself while you can , now , then . Have another toffee . ( PATTING BARNEY ) Good boy , good boy , well done . What 's he doing ? What are you shooting at ? Just keeping them occupied . Shooting ? ( SIGHS ) ( PANTING ) Don 't move ! Leave it ! - You ... - You don 't remember me ? Go on then , blow my brains out . - And get back from the shotguns . - Why should I ? - You think I care what ... - Go on , get back from the guns . Now , no one 's going to hurt you . No ? Just take everything and leave me to starve . It 's been tried . Yeah . Paul ! Price ! Barney ! Come on . It 's all clear ! - Come mob-handed , have you ? - Oh , yeah . Like the wolves down on the fold . I 'm sorry I didn 't do a better job fixing your legs . But I 'm not a doctor . I was the one who got you out from under the tractor . ( SCREAMING ) ( GUN FIRING ) Get down ! I thought he said it was all clear . Get down ! Leave it ! Now , what the hell was that for ? You left me . You left me to die like a pig in my own filth . You left me in agony . You just took what you wanted and left me . I didn 't take anything . Why else would she leave ? I went to get some drugs for you . And I met her on the road . She told me that you were dead . Why else would she leave me ? Well , maybe she thought you weren 't going to be able to provide for her in a style to which she 'd become accustomed . ( SOBBING ) So she just left me to die . Yes . She just packed up her things . Wouldn 't look at me even . Stuck-up bitch . " What are you doing ? " I said . She wouldn 't say nothing . I remembered a man there . It was you . You 'd got round her , that 's what I thought . She wouldn 't just leave me . Well , she did . She was a lovely girl . Yeah , while you could provide the goodies . Yeah , I would have given her anything . I mean , she was out of my class , I know that . Oh , she was in a class all by herself . And she told you I was dead ? She told me you were dead . She 's still with you , is she ? Is she out there ? - Is she out there ? - No , she 's not out there . I haven 't seen her from that day to this . - You expect me to believe that ? - Well , you 'll just have to believe it . Because it 's the truth . Can 't even remember her name . Anne . Anne , her name was . Anne Tranter . Yeah , that 's it . So , no more funny business . You can do what you like . Paul ! Come on , Paul . TOM : Oh , yes . Come on . Come on , Barney boy . Oh , I 'd like to find her . I would . I 'd like to find her . - I will find her . - What for ? I 've got something to live for now . - What would you do if you found her ? - There is no " if " . I 'm going to find her . I 'm going to devote the rest of my days looking for that nicely-brought-up lady . ( SCOFFS ) Do you know what pain is , real pain ? Day after day , month after month . Forget it . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) - Where 's the rest of them ? - No , there aren 't any others . Just him ? Wow . Who 's the cowboy ? Paul . Sorry . I can 't remember your name . Yeah , I can 't scarcely either . It 's been so long since anybody called me anything . Ha ! Vic Thatcher . Tom Price , that 's me . Now , I don 't mind telling you , you put up a good fight . I 'll be the first to admit that . But , well , we got some good stuff here , right , lads , huh ? What do you mean " we " . All this stuff belongs to him . Right . Spoils of war , isn 't it now ? No , there hasn 't been a war . No , we only came here because we thought this place was unoccupied . Ah , but ... But we won , didn 't we , see ? We won , see , boy . You can take it . I can 't stop you . Listen , we 're not taking anything . - Not unless we take you , too . - Take me ? A few us have got a small commune going near Abercastle , about 40 miles away . What do you mean , take me ? I 'm all right where I am . You 're not going to be for long . Listen , there are groups of 10 , 20 , 30 people just scouring the countryside . They 're desperate for stuff like this . You 're the first people I 've seen in months . I 'm secluded here . That 's why we chose it . She might not come back here , of course . Not if she thinks there 's the slightest chance of you being alive . But then she might . She 's a greedy lady . So , do you want to join us ? I 'm not much use to you like this . No , you 're far too modest . You 've done really well for yourself . Don 't worry , we 'll find something for you to do . All right . What about all my stuff ? Do you want to take it with you ? Well , our transport 's pretty limited . Can 't take much of it with us this time . What we would need , though , is an inventory . I 've got one of those . Thirty hundredweight of flour . Two gross tins of ravioli . ( BREAKS SCREECHING ) What did we stop for ? Highway code . At a major road , stop , check that it 's clear of oncoming traffic before proceeding . Oh , yeah . You know , we could go on a pig hunt tomorrow . You can 't farm land without pigs . Yeah , pigs are a wonderful animal . ( BOTH LAUGHING )

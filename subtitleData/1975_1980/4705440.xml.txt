 Get up ! Hello , Zee . So you 're getting around . How 's the leg ? . You drunken butcher . Look what you did ! You 're lucky to have it , my friend . Lucky ? . You crippled me , Kline . When they brought you to me after that explosion you had no leg at all . I built that out of pieces ! - Get up ! - Why ? . I want to see you fall down . All right , I 'm gonna count to three . One ... Two ... [ GUNFIRE ] Ah ! Thanks . Next time don 't leave it so late . Get out . Ungrateful scum ! Have a drink , T ravis . One of us has to see straight . Better be me . So , you 're a surgeon . Used to be . I heard about that business on the Baree . A secondary burner blew out . I did what I could for the survivors . And is he one of them ? . T ravis ? . No . He was a passenger , and now he 's my bodyguard . I see . And do all your ex-patients try to kill you ? . Thirty of them have every right , Chenie . I should never have done it . Never ! This is a picture of Docholli . He 'll have changed his name , of course . He could have had a face job done by now as well . No , he hasn 't had time . Servalan 's been on his heels from the moment he escaped with the location of Star One . - Well , he 's out of her reach now . - Officially . How do you mean ? . Freedom City may be outside the Federation , but that won 't stop Servalan . Oh , she 'll find some way of getting to him , but if she gets to him before we do ... Goodbye Docholli ! And goodbye to any chance of finding the Federation control centre . Right . You know what you have to do , Vila . I want you or Avon on stand-by in the teleport the entire time we 're in Freedom City . - Yes , you said . - Right , let 's go . Bye . [ DRUM ROLL ] Speed chess . The only game of skill in this establishment . The Klute challenges all comers . A win or a draw gets you a million ... One million credits , mes amis . Win or draw against the Klute . The biggest prize in the galaxy . Now come on , all you space trekkers . Put your life on the line and beat the Klute at speed chess . Win a fortune ! Krantor will see you now . Wait here , Jarriere . Ah ! Commander Servalan . Welcome , welcome , welcome ! This is indeed a pleasure . You may go , Toise . We so rarely receive an emissary from the Federation here in Freedom City . I am , Commander , transfixed with delight ! Supreme Commander . Ah ! My apologies . Supreme Commander . Pray , be seated . You appear to have misunderstood my message , Krantor . I am not here officially . But of course . I understood ... perfectly . Discretion and delicacy are the very watchwords of my organisation . Just tell me your requirements and I will see that you are provided with the most sophisticated ... and subtle forms of satisfaction . You have misunderstood . I am here unofficially but on Federation business . - Oh , how sad . T ry a pataki cake . - A what ? . They contain the distilled venom of a local reptile , and the effects are ... highly stimulating . No , thank you . There is a man here named Docholli , a cyber-surgeon . I am willing to pay two million credits for him , dead or alive . My dear Commander , there are many wanted men here . They come to Freedom City because we are outside the Federation . Not very far outside . I do hope that isn 't as threatening as it sounds . That would be ... most unwise . Are you sure I can 't tempt you ? . - Quite sure . - Ah ! There is a second man here named T ravis . He has an artificial arm and an eye patch . I am interested in finding him also . An eye patch ! Oh , how quaint . Well ? . Placed as we are , we must necessarily maintain a position of strict neutrality . And what does that mean , exactly ? . You will not be impeded in your search for these men . Krantor , I don 't have time for that . It is vital I find Docholli before certain insurrectionist elements contact him . Oh , I see . Insurrectionist elements ? . A Federation problem which we intend to eliminate . - Really , Commander . - Supreme ... Supreme Commander , you make my blood run cold . I wonder if I emphasised sufficiently how highly we value our neutrality . I 'm sure I must have done . How highly ? . Also , my casino ... very profitable ... four million credits a week . You have a suggestion ? . Ten . Eight . For both T ravis and Docholli . My dear Com ... Supreme Commander . I always say we are sent to help each other . What is this life if we cannot be of some service to our fellows ? . Give me two hours . Thank you . I have booked room 1 00 at the terminal . I know . Well ? . T ravis came in on the Baree 's last trip . He spends all his time down on the Rink . Toise , are you sure that head gear is part of the uniform ? . It is of the period , Krantor . It looks a little heavy . May I say that your own costume is ... quite magnificent . It really suits you . Yes , it does , doesn 't it ? . My designer tells me that it is patterned upon the attire of someone called the Prince Regent . What a pity that everybody doesn 't enter into the spirit of Carnival , of ' Mardi Gras as wholeheartedly as you and I. Docholli ? . No record under that name , but there is a Kline who carried out emergency surgery on board the Baree after an explosion there . He too stays down on the Rink , drinking heavily . - Worth investigation . - Mm . The fact that Servalan was so willing to pay so much in order to prevent her political opponents from contacting him ... Very interesting . It indicates that he possesses some important Federation secret . Which we can extract before giving her ... his body . Krantor wins both ways . Rule of the house . - They say it 's wide open . - What is ? . - Freedom City . - So I 've heard . Wide , wide open . - Got everything a man ever dreams of , they say . - Space City pales by comparison , they say . You know , if it was a desert down there , so hot your eyeballs frizzled , poisonous snakes under every rock ... - Blake would have sent us . - You can bet on it . - Bet ! Why not ? . It 's perfect . - What is ? . There is a casino down there . It is called the Big Wheel . No stake limits . Why don 't we bust it ? . Because we 're up here and the casino 's down there . We go down there . We can get Orac to operate the teleport . He can do it just as well from down there as up here . - You mean take Orac with us ? . - Of course we take Orac with us . You dummy . You haven 't caught on , have you ? . What 's in your mind ? . The Big Wheel is run by a computer that fixes the odds at five percent in favour of the house , right ? . - Right . - Right . Orac reads computers . Ohhhh , that is beautiful ! Avon , there are times when I almost get to like you . Yes , well , that makes it all worthwhile . I mean , you give me a warm feeling right here , around the money belt . We are going to need some kind of casing for Orac . Wait . Suppose Blake wants fetching up while we 're on surface ? . Oh , he 'll be several hours looking for Docholli . We can break that casino and be back up here inside of one hour . He need never know that we were gone . - I just needed convincing . I 'm convinced . - I 'll get a casing for Orac . Just a minute . Look at Orac . I mean , look at it . It 's a bit on the bulky side for smuggling into a casino , wouldn 't you say ? . Orac , are you familiar with the theory of molecular reduction ? . Am I to assume that you refer to the stabilised atomicimplosion ? - Yes . Vila and I were just discussing it ... - We were ? . ... and I was assuring him that the whole idea is an absurd fantasy . On the contrary . It is neither absurd , nor is it a fantasy . Are you suggesting that you know more about the subject than I do ? . It is not a suggestion ; it is a statement of fact . Do you seriously expect me to believe that you could , for example , reduce your size without affecting your function ? . - I could . - For how long ? . It would depend on the degree of reduction . Approximately one-eighth of your current size . Two hours , six minutes . - Talk 's cheap . - Does that mean something ? It means he doesn 't believe you , and neither , as a matter of fact , do I. - I take it you wish me to prove it . - Why not ? . [ ELECTRONIC SHRINKING ] - Come on Kline - Put him in the back . - Why does he do it ? . - He gets thirsty . - You want a drink now , T ravis ? . - I 'll have a Vitazade . Earlier tonight he said that thirty of his ex-patients tried to kill him . What does that mean ? . It means he gets drunk . Well , whatever he 's got on his mind , it can 't be that bad . I hear he was quite a hero at the Baree . Perhaps he was trying to pay something back . They say he was one of the first in the burner . When the fumes got too much for him , it was you who dragged him out . Oh , yes . I 'm a hero , too . So . You 've saved his life twice . Why ? . It 's my noble nature . Oh , yes , T ravis . I can see . It shines from your one yellow eye . Nobility ? . Thanks for the drink . What 's this about ? . You 're being collected . We 're Krantor 's rubbish collectors . " Collected " ? . No . Don 't kill him . Not yet . Oh , you don 't trust Krantor . He is a despicable animal . When the Federation finally cleans out this cesspit , I shall have that vulpine degenerate eviscerated with a small and very blunt knife . Um , if the Supreme Commander feels like that about him ... For the moment we need Krantor . Even if he cannot be trusted ? . Oh , he can be trusted to do anything for money . He 'll deliver T ravis . And Docholli ? . I told him Docholli , dead or alive . Already he is wondering why a corpse should be worth so much . Then , ma 'am , we are likely to get the corpse . Yes . - After Krantor has learned the answer to that question . - Exactly . Let 's try the dives along there . Shouldn 't we split up ? . We may cover more ground . I think we 'd better stick together . - But he 's not likely to be here anyway . - Why not ? . The Federation 's top cyber-surgeon ? . Why should he be ? . She 's right , Blake . He 's led a privileged life . He 's got money . He 's also been on the move for a long time . But even so , a man with his skills can always earn it . Not enough . When you 've been on the run for as long as Docholli has , everything costs : False identity papers , phoney visas . I mean no one 's going to stick out their neck to help him unless they stick out their hand first . No , I don 't think Docholli 's got much now . That is why I think we 'll find him somewhere like this . Oh , Supreme Commander , how prompt you are . Such an admirable , military virtue . The matter of which we spoke earlier . Get to the point , Krantor . The first package is already on its way and naturally I do expect payment on delivery . Naturally . T ravis , I imagine . The second will follow in due course . But if you find time is , um , dragging , I can provide some very original forms of diversion , which I guarantee will give you immense pleasure . Docholli is all I want from you , Krantor . Krantor . One of these days , Toise , I am going to have Supreme Commander high-and-mighty Servalan ravaged until she does not know what month she 's in . I 'll have her screaming for death . I ... Krantor ! We have a trekker ready to challenge the Klute . Oh ! And so early , too . It 's usually much later , when they 're drunk , or desperate . I say , what a profitable start to the evening . Come on , my friends . Gather round . You are about to witness the most important spectacle in the history of sport . Friends and patrons ! We have here a young trekker as you can see . His name is ... Thrylce And he is challenging the mighty Klute at speed chess . Your applause for his courage , please . Alors . The rules of speed chess are tres simple . Simple . Each contestant has five seconds to make his move . If he exceeds that time ... tant pis ... he loses a pawn . If Thrylce wins or forces a draw , then he wins one million credits which I myself will present him . [ APPLAUSE ] If he loses , he will never need money again , his chair being connected to an electrocution key . And if the Klute wins , he has the right to press that key . That is the Klute 's only reward . Ahhh . Please stand well back from the chair . Are we ready now ? . Thrylce ! You have the advantage of the white pieces and the first move . Ha ha ha .. [ AUDIENCE LAUGHTER ] [ ELECTROCUTION ] Ha ha ha ha ... He must have been crazy , staking his life . - Just risking money isn 't always enough . - What ? . If you 're a gambler , that 's the biggest gamble you can take . That 's the real kick . Well , he got his kick all right . Straight up the spine . Four million credits . Excellent payment for damaged goods . I take it Travis was damaged ? . You know Cevedic . And now he is searching for Kline , who is probably Docholli . He 's had a bad beating , Commander . Concussion , I think . He 'll soon come round . T ravis is very strong . - Oh , he once worked for you ? . - Yes . And now he 's an outlaw ? . Uh , what happened ? . He outlived his value . But now he can perform one last service for us . In what way , Commander ? . T ravis has been here weeks . He will have found out where Docholli is hiding . Perhaps not , Commander , if he 's no longer interested in the affairs of the Federation . I know T ravis better than he knows himself . He has one single dominating obsession . And that is to kill Blake . - The revolutionary ? . - The political criminal . And Travis knows that Blake also is hunting Docholli . - Because he wants the information that only Docholli has ? . - Exactly . And that is why T ravis is here . Shadowing Docholli , waiting for Blake to arrive . If you 're right , Commander , when he comes round , we can force him to tell us where to find Docholli . That might take too long . T ravis has a high pain threshold , and we don 't have the proper facilities here . No . I have a better idea . Disconnect that artificial arm . What are you going to do ? Turn Travis into a walking bomb . Uncouple those neural relays , Jarriere . Good . Now pass me a nito grenade . You 're going to put it in his arm ? Just draw the pin first . There . Now we put the arm back again . Careful . What about the connections ? Leave them . When Travis finds his gun arm isn ' t working , the first thing he 'll do is go to Docholli to get it fixed . And as soon as he takes the arm off ... they both die . That 's brilliant , Commander . So you ' ve arrived , Servalan . Where 's Blake ? . Is he heading here ? . For once I 'm not interested in Blake . I want Docholli . I can 't help you there . You have Docholli staked out . You 're waiting for Blake . I haven 't seen Docholli in two years . Just stay where you are . That your new muscle , Servalan ? . Looks like a powder puff . Yes , well , let 's forget the pleasantries . Tell me where to find Docholli ; I 'll let you have Blake . You haven 't got Blake . T ravis . We could forget the past . Wipe it out . I 'm willing to help you again . My arm . What have you done to my arm ? . Why ? . What 's the matter with it ? . Damn you , Servalan ! It must have been damaged when you were brought here . Shut up ! So , you 're working with Krantor . Just bought a little help . T ravis , you know why I want Docholli . His mouth has to be sealed . Why don 't we trade ? . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Good news , Supreme Commander ! . My men have just collected the second part ofyour esteemed order . You have Docholli ? . We believe so . He will be delivered as soon as we are certain of his identity . I can identify him . Not necessary , Commander . We have the most advanced forms of questioning . That may win us a little time . But she 's as perfidious and devious as a snake . Get word to Cevedic . Forget Docholli for the moment . I want T ravis found and killed at once . T ravis , we no longer need you . So ? . You 're afraid I 'm going to kill you at last . Probably I shall if our paths cross again . At the moment , you are too small to bother with . Get out . Before I change my mind . - You just got in ? . - Yes . - Came by freighter , eh ? . - Was that a guess ? . Well there 've been no passenger liners here in a month . We 're near the docking cradles , you see , so we know everything that comes and goes . Even the planet hoppers . It 's an interesting life you lead . - You planning to stay ? . - For a while , maybe . - Well you 'll find no work here . - Who said that we wanted work ? . If you had money , you wouldn 't have come by freighter . So you need work . Suppose we do ? . You 'll do better on the upper level . T ry the Big Wheel . The girls have got class . Krantor might hire them . Nice trade you 're doing these days , Chenie . Until a minute ago . Stay around , girls . - Where 's Kline ? . - Who ? . Oh , you know who I 'm talking about . The surgeon who came in on the Baree . - Well how should I know ? . - He drinks here , Chenie . Now where is he ? . I 've no idea . He left here an hour ago . Now you wouldn 't be lying to me , would you , Chenie ? . No . I 've no idea where he goes when he leaves here . Because if you 're lying to me , I 'll tear your face off . - What 's in there ? . - This is private , Cevedic . When Krantor wants somebody , nowhere 's private . Now out of the way . - Look , I swear I don 't know where Kline is . - Cevedic . Chenie , I 'll be back . Who 's the ape-man ? . Krantor 's professional killer . - The same Krantor that runs the casino ? . - The same Krantor that runs Freedom City . - She was lying , Blake . - What ? . About Kline . He 's in the back . And I 'll give you any odds that he is Docholli . Fifteen black . - Krantor ! Someone is having a run on the wheel . - A big win is good for business . This fellow 's hit seven shots in a row . He 's riding half a million credits ! You 're right , Toise , that 's too big . Which is he ? . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? . Come on . Drink this . You 've got to get away from here . Krantor ... no reason for him to be after me . There 's someone behind him . It could only be Servalan . - Who ? . - Servalan . She represents some people I once worked for . Agh . I knew they 'd get me in the end . You 've got to get out of Freedom City . Away from this planet . You can 't stay here now ! Don 't worry , Chenie . I won 't involve you . If I want to be involved ... Now listen . There 's a T rantinian planet hopper leaving here in a couple of hours . I think I can get you on it . T rantinian ship ? . The captain 's a regular here . He owes me a favour or two . He 'd never take me . I 'm a Federation citizen ... was ... T rantinians would never accept me . This is a planet hopper , Kline ! They 'll drop you off on some remote spot . You can completely vanish . No one will ever find you . To be safe ! At last ! Oh , Chenie , I could never repay you ! You don 't have to . I told you , he owes me . Now , listen . You know where the loading bays are . Well there 's a ship loading at Bay Ten . You 'll have to hide there until the ship 's released from the cradles . The captain will collect his clearance card , and then walk through the bay on his way back . That 's where you can join him . It 's only fifty yards to the ship . If anyone sees you , the chances are they 'll think you 're one of the crew . Now , have you got all that ? . Yeah . Suppose he doesn 't agree ? . Leave it to me . Now , come on , you 've got to be on your way . Go this way . It leads down to the Rink . Oh , and good luck , Kline . - What did you call me ? . - A cheap little space tramp . You slut ! - A ten-credit touch ! - What ? . You do that again , I 'll ... Break them up . And the same to you ! We 've got news for you . We don 't want to come back anyway ! You can keep it ! Jenna ! Cally ! Over here . - Did you find him ? . - I missed him by a couple of minutes . There 's a back entrance . Something must have scared him . - Cevedic , presumably . - He could be anywhere by now . He 's left his surgical kit behind . He may come back for it . - Why ? . - It 's his living . Well , right now I doubt he 's thinking about his living , just keeping alive . Well , it 's the only lead we 've got . Chenie 's obviously befriended him . I think he 'll be back . - So what do we do ? . - Wait . It 's over an hour , Commander . Krantor should have delivered Docholli by now . - Krantor doesn 't have Docholli . He was lying . - I don 't understand . Krantor had planted a bug on T ravis . He overheard everything that went on in this room . Oh , yes , but I ... He overheard us planning to use T ravis to kill Docholli . That pathetic little ploy was just an attempt to gain time while his men find Docholli . - Oh , I see . - Do you , Jarriere ? . Do you see at all ? . Krantor doesn 't want Docholli killed until he 's learned what secret he carries . - Exactly . - It 's a risk , Supreme Commander . Suppose T ravis doesn 't get to Docholli first ? . He probably won 't . Krantor will try to kill him . - But if that 's what you expected ... - Not just expect , Jarriere . I want T ravis killed . Because that will establish , beyond doubt , Krantor 's intentions . Ah , you mean ... I 'm not following . Krantor has T ravis killed to protect Docholli . Later he will send us Docholli 's body . It will be obvious that he has extorted the secret of Star One . Therefore Krantor himself will be placed on the Council 's death list . Now do you see ? . The secret of Star One 's location is of no use to a criminal like Krantor . However , that knowledge can bring about his death . Not only that . With any luck the Federation will be finally convinced , as I have argued for years , that we can no longer tolerate this pestilential rat-hole so close to our own territories . Freedom City will be finally burnt out . And this was all in your mind before we came here , Supreme Commander ? . Eradicating this planet has long been in my mind , Jarriere . Events , and Krantor , have played into my hands . Then all that can go wrong , Excellency , is if T ravis eludes Krantor 's men and reaches Docholli . Even then , it won 't go wrong . You see , I 've allowed for that possibility , too , Jarriere . - It 's T ravis ! - Shhh . I don 't know how he 's doing it , Toise , but he 's taking us . He must be stopped , Krantor ! Watch him . Watch him , carefully . Every time , just before he makes a bet , he moves his left hand up to his ear . Or his head . We must find out how he 's doing it . - Vila , come on . Let 's quit . - One last spin . We 're nearly four million up , Avon . All right , just once more . But after this , I warn you , I 'm walking out ... to be sick . Red fourteen . Make your bets . Messieurs et Mesdames , fates vos jeux . Rien ne va plus . What do you mean , you can 't find Docholli ? . He 's gone to ground in that maze by the docking cradles . Cevedic , you know I don 't tolerate failure . Your orders were to kill T ravis . As soon as it gets light , Krantor , I promise , he won 't survive an hour . That may be too late . I want him killed tonight . We put an audio tab on him . That may tell us something . He 's not here , Travis . So it is true . Krantor has got him . Krantor ? . No . Why do you say that ? . I heard . So , Krantor was bluffing . Things got too hot for him , but he 's all right now . I 've found him a safe passage out . - Where is he ? - In a safe place . - I must find him . You must tell me where he is . - He doesn 't need your help , T ravis . All right , all right , Chenie , but I need his ! My arm . - What happened ? . - The neural circuits have gone . He 's the only man who can fix it for me . - Oh , I don 't know . - I 'm crippled . Helpless . You can 't leave me like this ! I 've never been sure of you , T ravis . Oh , for ... Chenie , do you think I 'll give him away ? . I 've saved his life , twice . The least you can do is tell me where he is . Oh , all right . But if anything goes wrong , I warn you . All I want is my arm fixed ! He 's in loading bay ten . By the docking cradles . - That 's better . - Oh , and T ravis , if you want your arm fixed , you 'd better take his instruments . He left them in here . - Loading bay ten . You better hurry . - Yes , Krantor . And when you have disposed of T ravis , don 't forget to bring me Docholli . Now , for our other problem . Tell the croupier to shut the wheel down , Toise . It has developed a mechanical fault . - That is Docholli 's case he 's carrying . - Are you sure ? . Let 's go . Keep in the shadows . - Docholli 's in there somewhere , but he 's not a problem . First we get T ravis . - Okay . - Over here behind the machine . Thank you , thank you . It 's a pity the wheel broke down . I was just hitting my stride . For you , my dear . - How much has he won ? . - Nearly five million , Krantor . I want that money back , Toise . Have him picked up the moment he leaves . Unfortunately , Krantor , Cevedic took all the men when they went to look for T ravis . They 're still combing the city . Don 't just stand there ! Do something ! - I expect you 'll be leaving now . - I 'm just waiting for my winnings , old boy . Can 't leave them behind . Even if it is only money . My dear sir , my congratulations ! Five million ! That is a record . While your money is being ... packaged , I wonder if you would do Krantor the honour of joining him for a little celebratory drink ... in my sanctum . Well , thank you kindly , Krantor . Thank you kindly . [ DISTANT GUNFIRE ] Just luck . Ahhhh . - I went to a better school , Cevedic . - You 're a fool , T ravis . You 're going to die anyway . - Not as quick as you . - Soon as they take that arm off , kaputt . - What do you mean ? . - They leave you like that , you die of gangrene . Take it off and you die quicker . Oh , Servalan fitted you up well , T ravis . - Docholli . Where are you ? . - Over here . Who told you my name was Docholli ? . - I recognised you . - When ? . First time we met . - Just drop the gun , T ravis . - Blake . I 've been waiting for you . I knew you 'd come . I 'm glad I didn 't disappoint you . It 's Docholli I want to see . What do you want with me ? . Roj Blake . You may have heard of me . I have a ship called the Liberator . Yes , I 've heard of you , Blake . I repeat : what do you want with me ? . One piece of information : the location of Star One . Then you 're going to be disappointed . Friends and patrons ! Your attention , please . I have an important announcement . Vila , this gallant sporting gentleman , has agreed to end the evening with one final wager . [ APPLAUSE ] Friends , he has agreed to challenge the Klute at speed chess ! The terms of the game are : if Vila loses , he pays the usual penalty , but if he wins or draws , then I have promised to double his winnings . Yes , friends , he will leave here with ten million credits . [ APPLAUSE ] Bravo ! Bravo ! - Are you out of your skull ? . - Ah , Avon . Good ol ' Avon . And good ol ' Krantor . We 're gonna have another game . - Vila , what happened ? . - What 's going on ? . What am I doing here ? . Vila , the Klute offers you the white pieces and the advantage of the first move . - That drink , I 've been tricked . - Did you say something ? . - I don 't want to play . - My friend , it is too late . The stakes have been laid . If you withdraw now , I shall have no alternative but to declare your five million credits forfeit . - Play , Vila . - What ? . - Orac 'll give you the moves . - But the Klute isn 't a computer . - Play . Stand away from your friend 's chair , sir . If he loses the game , you might share his shock . Les jeux sont fait . - I find that hard to believe . - Why should he lie ? . He 's out of the Federation now . You never knew the location of Star One ? . I was a surgeon , Blake . I thought if I kept out of Federation politics ... - Docholli ! My arm . You 've got to fix it . - What happened ? . - The neural circuits . I brought your case . - A needle will do . T urn round . But you operated on the people who built Star One . The technicians , yes , thirty of them . I had no choice . Then you must know where Star One is located . How could you not ? . I erased their brain prints , their lives . I left them total amnesiacs . It was only towards the end that I ... Go on , Docholli . As I came to the end I realised that Servalan would never believe that I hadn 't scanned the brain prints , that I myself would be the last to be treated . Docholli ! Get on with it . Somehow , it was only then that I realised the enormity of my crime , can you believe that ? . - Docholli ! - Yes , I can believe that . And that 's when I decided to run for it . I faked the operation on the last of my victims . What the devil ? . It 's all right , it 's not primed . So , Servalan thought we 'd all die together . She must have some other plans . All right , Blake , if you 're man enough , kill me now . - Our quarrel is the Federation , not with you . - Give me the gun , then . That would be mercy . Are you feeling particularly merciful ? . Bishop takes pawn . Check . [ GASPS ] The Klute offers a draw ! Let 's get out of here . I don 't understand , Toise . What happened ? . What happened ? ! . I 'll tell you what happened , Krantor , you blew it ! - What 's going on ? . - It 's all right , Chenie . They 're friends . They 're friends . - I didn 't know you had any . - I have some , these last minutes . Well , get moving . Can 't you see the man here is getting worried ? . Sure . Docholli . That last operation . You said it was faked . Does that mean he can still remember ? . - As far as I know , Blake . I certainly hope so . - Who is he ? . His name was Lurgen . He was a cyber-surgeon like myself . Perhaps that 's why I changed my heart . Anyway , we faked the operation between us . We didn 't erase the brain print , we took a copy of it , and then we both ran . He took the copy with him . I heard that he 'd gone to earth on a planet called Goth . Later I heard that one of their tribal chiefs had his brain print on a thong round his neck . Well , either it was the print , or his head . They 're a crude lot on Goth . - Yes , well , good luck , Kline , whatever your name is . - I 'll see you again , Chenie . Maybe . - Quickly , Vila . Hide the money ! - Liberator , do you hear me ? - Reading you , Blake . - Bring us up , Avon . Bringing you up now . Welcome back . How did you get on ? . - We managed to reach Docholli . - Oh , great . Wonderful . Terrific . We didn 't get the location of Star One , though . I think it 's my turn on call , Avon . Oh , you 're back . Vila , I don 't like that innocent look . What have you two been up to whilst we 've been away ? . - Me ? . Nothing . Had a little sleep . - Played a little chess . - Played a little chess . - And that 's all . [ ELECTRONIC RE-GROWTH ] That 's right , Blake . We had a real quiet time .

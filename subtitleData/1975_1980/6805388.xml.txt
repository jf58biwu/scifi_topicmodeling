 Kouji Kabuto and Duke Freed I should see Mount Fuji in 30 minutes . A UFO ? There 's no mistake . Let 's pursue it , TFO . What 's with this thing ? Can 't it go any faster ? Darn . But , I definitely saw that UFO . Aliens have come to Earth ! Good afternoon , Mount Fuji ! Brings back memories ... Oops . I forgot I 'm no longer the pilot of the Mazinger . I am the pilot of the world 's first man-made flying saucer , the TFO . Hey boss ! There 's an object 20km from the base . It must be Kabuto 's TFO . Alright . Please make contact . Yes , Sir ! This is the Space Research Center . TFO , please respond . This is the TFO . Space Research Center , please go ahead . Please land at sky point at 035 degrees . 15.7km from your location . Roger ! Hey ! Daisuke ! Look ! He 's all grown up ! I see . He 's going to be a real beauty . Have you seen father ? Not again . Is he up there again ? Father ! Please stop fooling around , and help out Daisuke with the chores ! You call this " fooling around ? " I 'm chairman of the " Let 's Be Friends With Aliens Society . Tracking a potential UFO is an important part of my responsibilities ! Aliens and UFOs . It 's all just a pipe dream . If you have that much spare time , go clean the stable ! Women and children don 't understand a man 's work . You guys have no imagination at all . But I 'm different . I 'm going to bet on the endless galaxy ! I 'm going to find a UFO no matter what ... Here 's one ! It 's here , it 's here , it 's here ! Come on , UFO ! Come over here ! Come on UFO ! Come on , come on ! It 's really here ! It finally came , a flying saucer ! The flying saucer landed ! I need to go and get changed right away ! You shouldn 't get so close ! No need to worry ! You shouldn 't get so close ! I can speak the alien language ! Tarine Tarine ton ton kin ! Trine Tarine Don don No Tarine Don ! He doesn 't look like an octopus . He 's not from planet Mars . Some aliens are shape-shifters . I saw it on TV ! I see ! So he 's transformed himself into a human shape ! What are you talking about ? I 'm a genuine Japanese person . He speaks Japanese as well ! What a smart alien ! How should I explain this ? Jeez . Hey . Thanks for coming all the way across the Pacific . Professor , it 's a pleasure to meet you . My name is Kouji Kabuto . The pleasure is mine . Let me introduce you to my staff , Mr. Hayashi , Mr. Yamada , and Mr. O-oi . This is Mr. Kouji Kabuto . Nice to meet you . What 's going on here ? Isn 't this guy an alien ? ! Not at all . No , Mr. Kabuto has been working with us in the US Space Research Center , helping us develop a flying saucer . This TFO is his own design . Also , this is Makiba Danbei . He is a co-owner of this stable with me , and , this is his daughter , Hiraku . Also , Goro . Nice to meet you . My real occupation is not a stable owner . I 'm the chairman of the " Let 's Be Friends With Aliens Society . What ? " Let 's Be Friends With Aliens Society ? " Yes , that is correct . I 'm Hikaru Makiba . I really thought you were an alien ! Me too ! An alien ? I 'll take that as a compliment ! They say , " A picture is worth a thousand words . " Before I forget ... Hey ! Daisuke ! Come over here ! This is my son Daisuke . This is Kouji Kabuto . I 'm Kouji Kabuto . Pleased to meet you . I heard there were many sightings of UFOs in Japan . So I came to investigate . I have work to do . Daisuke ! Why don 't we talk some more ? That 's right ! You need to fool around like me ! Winter 's just around the corner . We don 't have time to waste . I don 't like him at all . He didn 't even take a peek at my saucer . This observatory is the pride of our Space Research Center . It 's the same saucer I was chasing earlier . Sir , it 's a flying saucer . Should I follow it with the TFO ? I would advise against that . Why do you say that ? Sir , do you not believe in the existence of aliens ? That 's not it at all . Sir ! NASA has accepted the existence of aliens , and many Japanese citizens have been spotting UFOs . I just hope they are not hostile aliens . They just want to interact with us . That 's why they are here constantly . I really hope so ... People should start thinking about interacting with them as well . At this rate , we 'll miss our opportunity . Kouji . Now I know why you chose this position . Just as Japan was once united , you want to unite the galaxy . When you put it like that ... It 's been my dream . It 's a wonderful dream . Not at all . Here you go ! Hey ! Gramps , you are really good with that lasso aren 't you ? Father said , when he was young , he was a Texas cowboy ! You sure don 't look it ! What do you know ? ! I used to be one of the best ! Alright ! I want to challenge you and give the rodeo a shot ! That 'll be fun . Daisuke ! Please bring a horse ! Please bring the wildest one ! Hey , hey ! Are you sure you 'll be OK ? Sure thing ! That looks fun ! I 'm going to stay away . Are you sure he 's the wildest one you could find ? Leave it up to me ! Is Kouji going to be OK ? Don 't get excited , just stay calm ! Here ! Are you okay , Kouji ? It 's nothing ! Watch out ! Thank you , Daisuke ! That was awesome , Daisuke ! Dang it ! A red moon . That 's Planet Vega 's launch signal . We should notify the air force . They will attack for sure . Attack ? That 's right . They will come to invade the Earth . Invade ? Why would you say such a thing ? Because a red moon is a launch signal . Are you day dreaming ? It 's nothing unusual . No different than a rabbit on the moon ! I 'd suggest you stay out of this . You 'll only get hurt if you underestimate those UFOs . What did you say ? ! You want to challenge me to a boxing match this time ? Daisuke ! Where are you going ? What an ego that guy has ! I don 't want to pilot it ... Not any more ! I don 't want to pilot it ! I don 't want to pilot it anymore ! I now have this firm ground ... I don 't want to pilot it ! I don 't want to pilot it ! I don 't want to pilot it ever again ! I don 't want to pilot it ! From this day forward , you are my son , Daisuke Umon . My son Daisuke ! It 's no use ... After all , I ... I ... For a flying saucer , it 's very basic . We have nothing to fear . Alright ! Then we will commence an all out invasion tomorrow ! Hikaru is so good at this ! Really ? Okay ! Next ! Alright then . Let 's go for a run after you eat . It 's a UFO ! A UFO is coming ! This time it 's for real ! Welcome friends ! Come on down . This is Dunbei ! Welcome to our world of peace ! Today , I 'll find your true identity ! Hey ! You can 't handle this ! Are you trying to boss me around ? Stop it ! It 's for your own good . Don 't talk down to me . Stop wasting time with horses , and go help your dad ! You are his son , aren 't you ? So you won 't listen to my plea ? When someone tells me not to do something , I can 't help it . Yahoo ! They 've come ! My name is Kouji Kabuto . Which planet did you come from ? Do you understand me ? If you understand , please respond ! What are you doing ? I 'm not your enemy ! This craft , the TFO is unarmed ! Please believe me ! If you would just listen , you 'd understand . What are they doing ? Kouji 's in danger ! I told him ... That moron ! He has no idea ! Duke Freed ! Grendizer surface ! Professor ! There 's a strong magnetic interference beneath the research center ! What ? Could it be ? Daisuke ... Grendizer ! Go ! Spin Saucer ! Spin Drill ! That 's Grendizer . So Duke Freed was here on Earth . Should we attack ? Alright ! Launch the saucer beast ! Yes sir ! Saucer Beast Giru Giru Trying to escape from me ? Melt Shower ! Damn it ! I can 't shake him off ! I see . The saucer beast plans to use TFO as a hostage . Chute In ! Dizer Go ! TFO ! Get a hold of yourself , Kouji ! Get ahold of yourself ! Kouji ! Hand Beam ! Anti-Gravity Storm ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Screw Crusher ! Space Thunder ! Double Harken ! Dizer Punch ! Dizer Jump ! Spader Cross ! Chute Out ! Alright ! For now , we 'll retreat and evaluate the footage of Grendizer 's fight against Giru Giru . Yes , Sir ! You came , Kouji ! Morning ! Good morning , are you alright ? Yeah , but that was a hairy moment ! You should 've listened to Daisuke . Daisuke ? Daisuke ... Could it be that you ... What about me ? Could you be ... That pilot ? I think you are still in shock , Kouji . Those were Daisuke 's eyes , that time . That time ... Hey , you are in my way . Move it ! Oh , Our Green Planet ! The moon orbits the Earth with the same side always facing it . The other side is never seen . The Vega Empire , after experiencing defeat by Duke Freed , plans to make their base on the hidden side of the moon . [ Skull Moon Base ] All right ! Let 's go ! Yes , sir ! Commander Gandal , I 'm reporting in . You have a lot of nerve to show your face after that defeat , Blaki . Sir , I am sorry . I did not realize he was on Earth ... Idiot ! With the mighty Vega fleet , how dare you lose to him . But , Sir , he possesses Grendizer ! I already know . Should he decide to go up against us with Grendizer , we will be forced to rethink our invasion plans ! Gandal . Yes , Emperor Vega . Why is the mighty Vega fleet afraid of him ? To conquer the solar system , we must successfully invade planet Earth . Listen to my orders carefully , Gandal . Gather the forces of the Vega fleet and crush him . Until then , assume that the invasion of planet Earth is on hold . Do you understand me , Gandal ? ! Yes , sir ! I 'll be waiting for your next report . Yes sir ! Did you hear that , Blaki ? We must crush him no matter the cost . Commander Gandal , please instruct me on our next mission . If only he did not possess Grendizer . Commander Gandal , why are you cowering ? Eye for an eye . You must take revenge ! I am thinking about that . Do not hesitate for a single moment ! Blaki ! Commence the next attack immediately . Yes , sir ! Alright then . We will show him the power of the Vega fleet . Daisuke ! Father , please take a look . You say this is a sign of an invasion ? Without a doubt . They want revenge for their last defeat . They will arrive in two to three days . I can 't do it . I do not wish to pilot Grendizer again . I do not wish to spread war on this beautiful green planet . But ... Emperor Vega will never give up . They will ... without a doubt , attack Earth again . Daisuke ! Daisuke ... Is there no way to escape from one 's own destiny ? Kouji ... Why are you following me ? I want to know your true identity . You sure are paranoid . I am Genzo Umon 's son , Daisuke . Who do you think you are fooling ? You may fool others , but not me . I am just a citizen who loves this peaceful green planet . Why don 't we just leave it at that ? I don 't think so . I 've got an early morning . Please move aside . After you tell me who you really are . Don 't you run away ! Are you hurt ? Kouji ! What are you doing ? Just tell me who you really are ! Feel better now , Kouji ? No matter what ... I am going to find out who you really are . I only wanted to live as a human , and lead a simple life ... On this beautiful green planet ... Can I not even obtain the simple joys of life ? Why ? Why is that ? ! This is it . Uncle Dumbei , could you pull the throttle lever ? All right . Leave it to me . Are you sure , dad ? This is not a job for an old man , dad . You fool ! Don 't let my looks deceive you , I 'm still very young ! Is he really alright ? Jeez , I 'm so scared , I can 't look . Keep quiet ! It 's just a throttle or something . Thro-ttle ... There are a lot of switches to choose from . Please focus and pull on the throttle . Throttle ! I am sitting down ! He 's confusing " throttle " with " swattoru , " which means sitting down . Not sitting ! Throttle ! What are you saying ? He 's so thick headed ... You really are clueless , jeez . Please pull on this lever . Why didn 't you say that sooner ? That 's good . The humming sound of this engine , I feel like the pilot of this vessel ! I feel like I am flying ! Uncle ! Stop , stop ! Please bring it down ! I am really flying ! Uncle ! I said stop ! Stop ! You untamed saucer ! Stop , stop ! Stop it already ! Not again ! What can I do ? Let me off ! You finally woke up , uncle . Daisuke ! What happened to me ? You were unconscious inside the flying TFO . That was not a dream . I saw it with my own eyes . It was for real , there 's no mistaking it . Looks like I was right after all , Daisuke . So who are you , really ? Kouji . Looks like I was unable to fool you after all . So it is true ! Well , Daisuke is ... not my real son . Let me explain the truth about Daisuke to you . Daisuke was a prince from the Freed planet in the Vega system . His real name is Duke Freed . Duke Freed , a prince from planet Freed ? Planet Freed was an advanced , peaceful , warless planet . But ... One day , to conquer the Vega system , the Vega Empire invaded our planet . They killed innocent civilians , and set our green planet on fire . Also ... Inside those flames ... My father , and my mother . Their lives were taken . After the technological advancements of planet Freed were taken by Emperor Vega , a powerful war machine was created . That was Grendizer . Vega created Grendizer to conquer all the planetary systems . However ... I couldn 't let him have Grendizer at any cost . I escaped from the prison , stole Grendizer , and escaped the planet . Grendizer flew across countless galaxies , and discovered a beautiful shining blue planet . That was Earth . I came across a crashed Grendizer , and unconscious Duke Freed . That was the fateful day that brought Duke Freed and I together . Is that why you adopted him as your own son ? Yes . It 's been two years now . I see ... Daisuke . Please forgive me for what I did last night . Don 't worry . That 's not like you . I 'll keep this secret to myself . Looks like I won 't be looking forward to getting punched for no reason anymore . Daisuke ! Dad said he needs your help getting the cows back in the stable . Oh , I see . Is it that time already ? Well , why doesn 't Kouji help us as well ? Let 's go before the sun sets ! Alright , you don 't need to pull on me so hard ! Hurry up , Daisuke ! Sis is waiting outside in the Jeep ! You are persistent , Goro . Daisuke ... Sorry for reminding you of your sad past . That 's alright , Dad . I think Kouji understands now . I wish I could have let you live a simple life as a human being . Professor ! A flying object is approaching from the moon ! What ? ! That 's the Vega fleet . Daisuke 's prediction was on target . The inevitable is here . Kouji . Don 't throw your life away so hastily . I 'm from Earth . I need to protect Earth . Kouji . I intend to be a human and protect it as well . No matter what you say , I 'm going to fight them . If you want to fight so bad , then you 'll have to get past me first ! So be it ! I have nothing against you , but I have to go fight ! Let 's go ! Damn you ! Fight like a human ! Kouji . I am only doing this to protect you . This green planet . This beautiful planet . I won 't let them do as they please ! Even if it costs my life , I will protect it . My new home . Duke Freed ! Hello , Moshi-Moshi , Ni Hao , Konnichiwa ! This is Gunbei ! If you can hear me , please respond ! All set . Let 's go ! Grendizer , go ! Daisuke ... I can not protect you from your fate any longer . Just ... Please return to us safely . To this green planet . Damn you , Vega fleet ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Spin Saucer ! Double Hand Beam ! Hey Kouji ! This is no time to sleep ! Wake up ! Don 't you know there are UFOs right above us ? ! Where 's Daisuke ? I don 't know . But we 've got to get out of here ! Dang it ! Space Thunder ! Damn you ... Launch the saucer beast ! Yes sir ! Saucer Beast Game Game There you are , Saucer Beast ! Space Thunder ! Now 's our opportunity ! Execute our plan to overpower him ! Damn it ! Damn ! He plans to crush me into the ground ! Chute in ! Dizer go ! Dizer go ! Oh no , I can 't get out ! Damn it ! I can 't go down like this ! Crush him ! Crush him ! At this rate , he and Grendizer will be crushed into pieces ! Damn ! 800 meters left ! 700 meters ! 600 meters ! 500 meters ! 400 meters ! 300 meters ! 200 meters ! Daisuke . Are you alright ? Kouji ... The enemy is coming from behind ! He 's going to attack you from behind ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ... I can not protect you from your fate any longer . But ... Please return to us safely . To this green planet . Damn ! He 's in pain now . Saucer Beast Game Game , drag him down to the bottom of hell . This is my chance ! Space Thunder ! I was able to protect it ... My new home ... Can you hear me , Daisuke ? Father ... You fought well . Kouji ... Had you not come in time , I would be ... Daisuke . You protected this planet as one of us . Kouji . Even if it costs my life , I will protect it . This green planet . Imminent Danger at Shirakara Ranch Help us ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! I 'm so glad ! Bastard ! Just a dream ... Shirakawa Ranch is a place of solitude . I won 't let them touch this place . Good morning , Daisuke . You are up early . Something wrong ? Yeah , I had a nightmare . I 'm concerned it 's a precognition of their attack . You need to relax . There must be others besides Vega in outer space . But we certainly should take precaution . Why did I dream such a nightmare on this happy occasion ? I want to pilot this thing somehow . First , we start with opening the lid . Uncle ! This is very delicate equipment . Say Kouji , back in my cowboy days I could ride anything ! So how about you let me ride this thing ? Are you kidding ? Don 't compare TFO ... with a horse ! Now just calm down . I just want to go deliver this invitation to the aliens . Take a look at this letter I wrote for them ! Hey uncle , if you have time to do this , why don 't you help out setting up for the party ? And I thought I liked you ! I don 't like stabbing my friends in the back . You mean you don 't like to be stabbed in the back ! All right ! To successfully invade planet Earth , we must demonstrate our superior military technology to the humans . Yes , sir ! Blaki ! Yes , sir ! Blaki ... Yes sir ! Your mission is to lure out Duke Freed . The more you destroy , the more likely he will show up . Make sure you spread destruction everywhere . Yes , sir ! Focus on that farm at .01 , do not leave anything left untouched ! Duke Freed will appear for sure . Here I come ! Do I look cool or what ? I am coming ! What 's that ? Crap ! You look so dumb falling off of that lazy horse ! What was that ? ! Hold it right there ! Not only does your shirt look like a flag , you fly just like one ! You calling me a flag ? Call me by my proper name , Banta ! You must be the new guy with the attitude ! My name is Kouji . Remember it . You might need my help someday . Why don 't you shut up and come down here ? ! Jeez , I 'd really love to . Not ! Hey flag , don 't get blown away ! Calm down ! Calm down ! Make sure you eat all you can while we are here ! You have no manners , Banta ! Oh ! My beautiful princess , Hikari ! Stop it right there , lover boy ! You lay a single finger on her and I 'll hang you from a tree ! Hikari ! How rude ! Now go help out with the party or something ! Yes , sir ! How is it ? Did you finish decorating the gate ? Yeah , it looks okay . I think I 'll carry out some food now ! You look happy . Winter is around the corner , so I better enjoy myself now ! But ... What ? Are UFOs going to attack us ? Test results look good . Next time , I 'll blow away any aliens who get in my way ! Ouch that hurt ! I 'm so glad nobody saw me crashing ! Did I just see something interesting ? Hayashi . Yes ! Aoi . Yes . Yamada and I will be going to the Shirakawa Ranch later . I understand . Aoi , Yamada will monitor the radio . Should you see any flying saucers , please contact him immediately . Yes , sir . What a lazy guy . Why does he get to goof off ? Your dad is really dedicated . You think he 'll contact the aliens ? To all aliens , please come to my party ! Welcome , hello , hello ! An unidentified flying object ! It 's a flying saucer ! Sai . Please calculate their arrival time ! Right ! Aliens will enter Earths atmosphere in 4 : 21 . OK , let 's contact the professor . Yes , this is Umon . A flying saucer will be entering the atmosphere shortly . They 've crossed space point X23 . Understood . A UFO has been spotted , and they are heading our way for sure , Yamada . Make sure you stay in contact at allitimes ! Yes , sir . Professor ! Kouji , The Vega fleet is heading our way for sure . Make sure to be on alert . Yes , sir . Well well , now that everyone is finally here . Time for a toast ! This is for adults ! You are too young for beer ! You are just being cheap ! That 's not it ! Father , any news about the UFOs ? Now let 's not look so serious . Have some beer and relax ! Everyone , please welcome the 7th annual party at Shirakawa Ranch ! Let 's start with a toast ! A word from the professor ? Let 's toast to the 7th annual Shirakawa party ! Cheers ! Cheers ! Where 's mine ? Daisuke ! Forget about Daisuke and let 's eat some food ! Leave me alone ! Banta ! Did I not warn you ? ! It 's all set for your neck ! I 'll hang him for you ! What ? ! I 'll take you on , flag ! Stop calling me flag , you saucer head ! So you wanna fight me ? Please stop . Both of you stop it ! You bastard ! What was that ? ! You 're the one that 's a bastard ! Go with the right . Fight , fight ! Father , please stop them ! Fight ! Back in the days , we fought all the time ! Fight fight ! Jab jab ! Both of you are such wimps . Daisuke ! Daisuke ! Daisuke , what are you doing there ? Well , nothing much . You are always like that . Why don 't you keep me busy ? Hey ! They started folk dancing . Let 's go ! If you don 't , I 'll do this ! What are you doing sneaking around in there ? ! Both of you come out ! It 's not like that ! Quiet ! I 'm going to hang him ! Now Hikaru , dance with me . Please , that 's embarrassing ! Hey Hikaru ! Why don 't you dance with me ? Everyone is always after Hikaru ! Hey , why don 't you dance with me ? Do you want to be hung from a tree ? Mr. Yamada , come dance with us ! Thanks , but I have to stay in contact withlthe space center . Don 't worry about that . This only happens once a year so come on ! I 'd like to , but there is a saucer ... So you are going to refuse my generous offer ? OK , I 'll go ... Aoi , take a look at this . We must contact the professor . They are about to enter our atmosphere . Thank you , but that 's really enough . No way , have some more ! No thanks , I really have to get back to work ! Don 't make me remind you again ! This only happens once a year ! Exactly ! Here we go ! Aoi , have you gotten in touch with the professor ? Not yet . You need to keep trying . UFOs are accelerating and approaching them quickly ! Dang it ! Where is Yamada ? Hey Daisuke , let 's dance together ! Sure , but ... Not so fast , Hikaru ! Not again ! Yamada ! What do you think you are doing there ? Sorry , sir . Captain Blaki . Mini-FOs are approaching their destination quickly . Soon , they 'll be dancing in hell ! Where have you been ? ! Why don 't you dance with me ? Well , I 'd rather not ... Don 't be shy ! Professor ! Saucers will be entering orbit very shortly . What ? The saucers are here ! Everyone stop ! Please , everyone ! We need to take cover now ! The saucers are coming ! Did you say saucers ? ! That 's great ! We have aliens coming to our party ! They 're here ! They 're here ! Come on , come on ! Welcome , welcome ! Sir , please stop ! Please take cover now ! Hurry everyone ! We need to evacuate ! This is all a big mistake ! We are your friends ! Friends ! I invited you to my party ! Uncle , watch out ! Hurry back to the space research center ! Dang it . Fire missiles ! Banta , Banta ! Hurry up , or do you want to burn to death ? ! Hurry up and get out of here ! But Daisuke , you need to help put out the fire ! Okay ? That 's right ! We 'll help too ! No . You 'll only get in the way . Oh , no ! Hikaru , Goro , are you two alright ? We 're fine . We might as well take a stand here . Yeah , me too ! Dang it ! Fire missile ! Eat that ! We are not interested in that puny flying saucer . Where is Duke Freed hiding ? Never mind ! Launch Saucer Beast Baru Baru ! Duke Freed ! Hayashi , Sai . Grendizer is launching ! That 's not good . Otherwise , they will find out where our base is . Aoi , deploy the anti-radar mist ! Roger . Deploying the anti-radar mist ! Saucer Beast Baru Baru Our radars are jammed . We can 't see ! This was our chance to find Duke Freed 's base ! Grendizer Go ! Is our radar back online ? There 's Grendizer ! We missed our opportunity to find his base ? ! Spin Saucer ! Damn you ! Spader Spin Go ! Take that , saucer beast ! Drill Saucer ! Space Thunder ! Damn you , Grendizer ! Retreat ! Yes , sir ! Kouji ! Come get me saucer beast ! Hey hey , no need for that . I took care of it , Kouji . Dang it , this is not my day ! Don 't push your luck ! This is nothing ! I 'm Kouji , after all ! As a chairman of the alien friendship committee , I am embarrassed . They got upset because the invitation did not arrive in time ! Young bloods burns without falter ! It 's a UFO ! Its a UFO ! A flying saucer is here ! Aliens are here ! This is wonderful . It 's another UFO . Let 's see ... Hello , this is Dunbei . Please respond to my message , flying saucer ! Alright , let 's raise the volume . Chili chilli pep peh . Where did you come from ? Hoi hoi Shirakaba Stables . Please respond , my little UFO . Hoi hoi , this is Shirakaba Stables . Let 's be friends . Come UFO pi pi pi ! Father ! Please don 't be so loud so early in the morning ! What are you talking about , Hikaru ? I spotted a UFO ! It 's right there ! Look ! That was definitely a UFO ! What are you looking at ? There are no UFOs here . That doesn 't matter . It 's my duty to contact the aliens . Hear my words in the sky ! Ten ten hari hari . That 's some crazy alien talk . UFO , UFO , where did you come from ? This is Shirakaba stables . Please respond ! All right . I 'll go chase them away ! You equipped it with weapons ? Wait and you 'll see . I equipped it with missiles , and my special bomb as well . The MiniFO 's already gone . Is that true ? Why won 't you come down to see me ? Why , my little UFO ? Why don 't you come down to talk to me ? Please talk to me ! I 'm glad you didn 't get hurt . What are you talking about ? Good morning ! Morning ! Time to leave . What about Banta ? We don 't have all day to wait for him . Hey , wait for me ! Hey ! Hey , wait for me ! Please wait for me ! I guess I 'll just cut through Shirakaba stables . Someone save me ! I 'm going to die ! Save me ! Save me ! Hurry ! Hey , hey , what are you doing ? It 's only knee deep . Why didn 't you say that sooner ? Now help me out saucer-boy . Are you asking for help ? You should learn your manners . I get it already . I want to go to school with Hikari . Please help me out , saucer-boy . Saucer-boy ? I mean , you handsome guy . That was scary . Hey ! Hey ! There was no need to help him . I see you 've fallen into one of my traps again , Banta . What kind of man would put traps around your farm ? It 's for scum like you . Don 't treat our stable like a road ! That 's because the bus turns around at your stables . Why doesn 't it come to my farm ! Open your eyes . Your road is a mess , of course the bus doesn 't run through there . Your road is full of potholes . It reminds me of my head . I feel bad for the tires on the bus ! The bus has already left , so I need to go . See ya ! " See ya ? " Wait ! Hold it right there , horse thief ! They 're both the same . Stop ! You aren 't going to get away from me ! Stop ! I caught myself a horse thief ! Damn it ! I 'm still good with ropes . Let 's see , here we go ! Hey uncle , what are you thinking of doing ? As you can see , I 'm going to hang a thief . That 's a bit extreme ! That 's the punishment for stealing a horse ! Do you get it ? Time to ... I haven 't done anything yet . You 're mean . This time it 's for real ! Father ! What are you doing ? I 'm just hanging a horse thief . You 'll end up getting hung for murder ! What ? ! There 's no way that can 't happen ! What ? You haven 't located Grendizer 's base ? We 've searched the entire earth with MiniFo 's ... but we 've yet to find Grendizer . Until we defeat Grendizer and Duke Freed , we can 't claim victory . Is there no way ? There is . Huh ? There is a way . Yes , Lady Gandall . Now keep quiet ! You can say all you want after you have defeated Duke Freed ! Blaki . Yes , ma 'am ! Attack indiscriminately . Attack indiscriminately ? That 's right . Attack areas where Duke Freed was spotted indiscriminately . Then he will certainly appear . I see . I was thinking the same . Sure you were . You insolent woman ! Did you say something ? No . Not at all . Don 't just stand there Blaki ! To win a war , one must always be on the offensive . Yes ma 'am ! We will commence our attacks immediately ! It 's a UFO ! Hey UFO ! Please wait for me ! We are all friends ! Let 's be friends ! UFO ! Saucer Beast Goru Goru All right , Goru Goru ! Destroy and burn everything in your path ! Dang it . I just can 't sit here and watch anymore ! Wait . I 'll go . They are after me . If you go , they will only increase their attacks . It will be worse . The Professor is right . Leave this up to me . Kouji ! Don 't worry . I 'll lure them away , don 't worry . Just leave it up to me ! Were counting on you . Wow , you really are cooperative today . I 'm off now ! Please push harder ! Did you skip your breakfast or what ? Are you trying to kill me ? I 'm working really hard back here . It 's not enough . Push harder ! Enough of this already ! I 'm done ! What a miserable guy ! Thanks gramps ! Just get outta here ! Come get some ! Gotcha ! Get out of my way ! Okay . I need to lure this thing away ! Here 's some more ! What are you aiming at ? All right . Time for another attack ! Come get me ! Kouji is doing wonderful . It 's going to get rough now ! How does he plan to escape ? All right . This looks like a good spot to fight . Here I go ! Darn it ! This is Kouji Kabuto . Space Research Center , please respond ! This is Kouji Kabuto ! Please respond ! Space Research Center . This is Kouji Kabuto . Please respond . Looks like they aren 't responding . I guess I 'm out of range . I crash-landed badly . I 'm not going to die in a place like this ! All right . I need to start repairing the TFO . Crap . Kouji ... Kouji , please respond ! There 's nothing on radar either ! There must have been an accident . I can 't think of anything else . I 'll go on a rescue mission . Are you sure ? There 's nothing to worry about . Okay . Duke Freed ! Grendizer go ! It 's a rescue beacon ! He 's 200km south of me . All right ! He 's falling for our trap ! Let 's observe him for now . We 'll make him pay later . Kouji-kun ! I 'm going to owe you one again ! Kouji , Kouji ! Kouji , Kouji ! Hang on ! It 's perfectly cooked . Eat ! It 's delicious ! Eat as much as you want . You 're a difficult guy to figure out . Even though you 're an alien , you know how to cook clams and fish . Put your hand in the sand . Can you feel the heat from the sun ? Sure . The sand on Planet Freed was the same . So you had fish in your sea ? Even the sunset looks the same . On Planet Freed , what did you call that star ? The Southern Cross star . Just like us . Just like you . Watch out ! Forget about me and save yourself ! No way ! We can 't escape from them ! Stay right here , got it ? They caught me ! The plan is working ! All right then , Saucer Beast Goru Goru ! Tear Grendizer apart ! If you crush me , this bomb will blow up the entire island ! Stop , stop ! Kouji , it 's dangerous ! Get away now ! That star told me not to run away ! The Southern Cross star . Goru Goru , destroy them now ! Eat my bomb ! Daisuke ! Chute In ! Daizer go ! Spin Crusher Punch ! Anti-gravity storm ! Darn it ! Kouji ! Daisuke . This time , I 'll help you ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Daizer Jump ! Spader Cross ! Spin Saucer ! Dang , this one 's tough . Melt Shower ! Space Thunder ! Crap ! He beat us again ! That 's awesome . My missile is nothing compared to that . Thanks ! I 'll return this to you . There 's no need for formalities . Just report . Yes Sir ! Please look at this . What 's this ? The Flames of our Love are the Color of the Sunset This would be an ideal location to land our UFOs . Blackie , these are planes . Yes sir . Apparently , there 's a contest on . There 's been a lot of traffic non-stop . I see , and you 'll have hostages as well . Yes Sir ! So Duke Freed 's hands will be tied . Our plans are flawless . Blackie , do not underestimate them until everything is over . Yes Sir ! Father , there 's the red moon again . Daisuke ... Because of me , many more people may get hurt . You need to think this through . If you leave , do you think our problems will be over ? But ... Run ! Daisuke . As long as the Vega fleet exists , Earth will always be in danger . This must be tough , but we can not let the past events of Planet Freed repeat on Earth . Dang it , watch where you 're going ! Why don 't you just wait until we stop ? Where 's that Kouji ? Right over there ! He seems irritated , doesn 't he ? Maybe he 's just nervous . Hey Saucerboy ! Calm down , calm down ! It 's you , four flags ! Did you come here to get on my nerves ? Why you ! You know my short temper ! Now , the two of you stop that ! Banta , you didn 't come here to start a fight . Yeah , we came to cheer him on ! You 're right . Good luck , Saucerboy ! Obviously ! I 'm not going to get beaten by them . I 'm so sorry for frightening you . But we can see you clearly from our monitors . You 're so cruel . What if the kids saw me like that ? My staff will look after the horse . Please come up using the elevator . How does it look , Daisuke ? Dad , there 's something I 'd like you to see . It 's so serious in here , it 's a lot colder than the stables , too . Welcome , Mr. Dun . I 'm surprised you came here . Well , it 's because the kids went to see Kouji at the plane contest . I didn 't mean to bother you . So I see . Please , make yourself comfortable . I didn 't realize Daisuke was here as well . You should 've told me . You are so cruel ! What are you looking at so seriously ? Let me take a look ! Wait , um , Uncle ... Let 's make it bigger ! Bigger ! Although there are no solar flares , there 's a large RF disruption . Are you certain ? At this rate , our radar may become inoperable as well . You don 't think the Vega fleet 's involved ? Whaa ! They are here ! They are here ! Saucers ! Lots or saucers ! Hayashi , can you get in touch with Kouji ? Since Kouji is busy with the contest , I can advise in the matter of flying saucers . Hello , Hello ! This is Dunpei ! Saucers please respond ! Kouji , please respond ! This is Kouji . Kouji , please abandon the contest and come back right away . Are you kidding me ? It 's starting now . What 's so important ? Something that 's important . Please abandon the contest . Number 21 , please start your engine ! Did you hear that ? I 've been instructed to start . I 'll finish this quickly , so please hold on . Hey , Kouji ! Wait , Kouji ! Sorry Daisuke , but I 've got to finish what I started . Let 's go ! Go get em , saucerboy ! Go get ' em ! All right , let 's take off ! Yahoo ! Don 't fall out of your seats just yet ! Here comes my Ultra-C ! Let 's cut out the engine ! Oh no ! He did it ! That was awesome ! Next one 's a falling leaf ! Not again ! Someone save me ! Let 's make it bigger ! Please , Professor ! So many flying saucers ! What ? What happened ? What 's wrong Professor ? They were coming down to respond to my friendly request ! How am I supposed to do this without a screen ? Well ... Professor , I lost all contact with Suzuki airfield ! What was that ? What 's going on here ? Oh no ! Nine Lives aren 't enough ! Okay , let 's finish it off with a really intense one ! Huh ? That 's a minifo ! Space research center ! Space research center ! Air Traffic Control ! Air Traffic Control ! Kouji ! Kouji ! Kouji ! I can 't die like this ! Don 't die on us ! Kouji ! Hang in there ! You 'd better not die on me ! Kouji ! Hey , what are you doing ? Hey flags , you are really fast , but I 'm doing just fine . I just came to make sure you 're dead . Kouji ! I 'm so glad he 's safe ! Flying saucers ! Where ? Run ! Take cover ! Wait for me ! That way ! Crap ! We 're done for ! Cut that out ! Stop poking at my butt ! Professor , the interference is gone now . Flying saucers . They appear to be headed toward Suzuki airfield . He 's so stubborn . I told him to abandon the contest . Professor , what 's happening ? Why are they headed to Suzuki airfield ? An evil alien force may be invading us . Evil ? What are you talking ? Aliens are ... Dun ! The universe isn 't just filled with kind hearted aliens . There are evil ones as well . Wait a second . Hikaru is at the airfield ! Banta , Goro , and Kouji are all there as well . Is there nothing we can do ? Please save Hikaru and others . Daisuke ! Please ! Never mind . I 'll go save them ! Daisuke ... I need to go now . Daisuke , don 't rush into things . I was good as dead anyway . If I can save a few lives , that 's good enough . Daisuke ... Duke Freed ! Grendizer Go ! Daisuke ! Hail our great empire ! I 've landed on Earth ! We will start our invasion with 500 flying saucers ! Captain Blacky , Grendlzer is approaching the airfield ! What did you say ? Continue with our operation . We have another prize , an even bigger one . Send in Saucer Beast Domu Domu . Can 't you do something Kouji ? Why don 't you look around first ? I suppose you 're right , but ... Banta ! Bastards ! Thanks . That 's Grendizer ! There 's another saucer , Kouji ! We 're really done for ! Melt Shower ! Spin Drill ! Dizer Beam ! What 's happening , Kouji ? What 's happening , Kouji ? What 's happening , Kouji ? What 's happening , Kouji ? Is he attacking his friends ? Flags , get ready to run for it . Even you can 't get out of this . That 's under handed , Blackie ... For the Vega Empire , there 's nothing I will not do . What will you do ? Do you intend to fight us still ? I have no choice , Blackie . I 'll do what you want . But , you must let them go . Okay then . Domu Domu , bring him back to Vega . Saucer Beast Domu Domu Duke Freed , we 'll drag you and Grendizer to hell . Along with your precious friends . You dirty scumbag . Get ' em , Saucer head ! Banta , take everyone to cover . I won 't let you all die . Wait for me , Kouji . Chute in ! Dizer Beam ! Dizer go ! Spader Cross ! Screw Crusher ! Spader Cross ! Screw Crusher ! Space Thund - Ouch ! Anti-gravity Storm ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Double Harken ! Spader Cross ! Chute Out ! Captain Blackie , what 's your order ? Without Domu Domu and the Minifos , we have no choice . We must retreat . Yes Sir ! Captain , there 's still the minifo that brat stole from us . I see . Remote detonate it along with that brat . Please let me pilot it once ! Please ! No way . Watch out ! Daisuke ! They 're all safe now . What ? ! Did you say Hikaru is safe ? I 'm very disappointed that you didn 't help them . I 'm quite upset with you . By the way , what have I been up to ? Ah , never mind . Wow Kouji . You were amazing ! You don 't need to . I was so worried about you two ! Father , please let us go . Please don 't do that ! I 'll never get married ! Ouch ! It 's nice to have a family . Well , Mr. Dun can be a handful . Daisuke , as long as that flame in your soul burns , you can reach out to others . Just like a family . Yeah . Fighting Spirit Beyond the Blue Skies Where are those adorable UFOs ? Oh , hey ! Hey , Hikaru , the bus is here ! Hurry up , Hikaru ! Please stop screaming like that , it 's embarrassing ! Well , why don 't you hurry up then ? Daisuke , please take care of everything while I 'm away . Have a lovely trip ! Thanks ! I 'm off now ! Hey , sis , don 't forget this ! You 're so forgetful ! Don 't blame me . Dad rushed me all morning ! Banta , feel free to take a shortcut . Really ? I said so , didn 't I ? Hurry up . That 's strange . Why is he so nice to me now ? I didn 't do anything wrong ! I haven 't kissed or held Hikaru 's hands ! It 's the truth . Please don 't kill me ! You 're going to be her body guard , all right ? You 'll throw yourself in frond of danger in order to protect Hikaru . That 's it ? I 'll take care of her , father . You dare to call me father ? Well , it will be my pleasure to protect Hikaru from danger . That 's the spirit . Yes , father ! Don 't call me father ! There you are , Hikaru ! You 're so late ! I 'm really worried about them . Earth is such a beautiful planet . It 's truly a treasure . You 're a commander of the Vegan fleet , not a civilian . Before you say any more praises , think of your next invasion plan . Command Gandal , what are your orders ? We will invade Tokyo ! An invasion of Tokyo ? To lure Duke Freed out . Let 's see ... Tokyo is really big , Hikaru . Don 't try to use this to get close to me . Don 't be so cold ! Our father has agreed to our future . Hold on ! Banta , please take care of my daughter . He 's always sticking his nose in things ! What ? This bus can fly ? Saucer Beast Damu Damu We 're inside the flying saucer ! I 'm so scared ! I 'm not going to fall for that ! I 'm scared of Hikaru as well ! What 's wrong , Kouji ? Are the UFOs here ? You 're so rude ! UFO come , come ! Come over here ! I can 't see a thing ! Kouji , the Saucer Beast has hostages . You must not act carelessly . I 'm aware of that . I 'll go on a recon mission . That would be fine . The Saucer Beast has taken a tour bus as a hostage . A tour bus ? There it is ! It 's the TFO ! Kouji came to rescue us ! Help us ! I don 't mind if you call me flags either ! Hikaru ? ! She must 've been on the tour bus . What ? Hikaru is a hostage inside the UFO ? I am certain it 's her . Father , I am heading out . Duke Freed ! Grendizer go ! I must rescue them now ! Kouji ! Is everyone okay ? Yeah . Do something saucer boy ! I mean , Mr. Kouji , please save us ! Calm down , flags . Who 's calling me flags ? ! Didn 't you say you weren 't going to get mad at him if he called you that ? That was back then , this is different ! There must be an exit switch on a wall or the floor . Let 's look ! It 's up to Duke Freed to save us now . Exactly as Commander Grandal predicted , Duke Freed has shown himself . With hostages , he won 't be able to attack us . Attack him now ! Yes Sir ! Saucer Beast Damu Damu , commence attack ! Kouji was also captured , and I must not hurt the hostages either . How should I rescue them ? What ? That 's Banta 's mom ! She 's sure making us aware of her presence , as usual . I 'm saved ! One disaster after another ... This is no time for you to take a nap ! Why are you in such a hurry ? There 's no need to be in a hurry , is there ? The tour bus with Hikaru was kidnapped by the flying saucer ! I heard it on the news . Shocked ! I must approach the Saucer Beast and find its weakness . I must escape or I 'm done for ! Duke Freed , you must escape . You must not get sucked in ! Grendizer Power Up ! Dizer Punch ! Command Gandal , our first attack has failed . Use the Press Attack . Hurt the hostages and he 'll come to us ! I see . Commence Press Attack ! Huh ? The Saucer Beast is landing ? We 've landed . Maybe he 's going to make a base here . What 's that ? Everyone , take a look up there ! They plan to crush us to death ! It hurts ! My lungs are hurting ! They 're sucking the oxygen out ! I only have five minutes worth of oxygen . Everyone , hang in there ! There 's something happening inside the Saucer Beast . Father ! Father ! I see only one way to rescue the hostages . What 's that ? It 's too dangerous ! There 's no time left , let 's give it a try . At this rate , Hikaru and the others will ... Father ! Professor , have you seen Daisuke ? Daisuke ? I was going to have Daisuke drive me to Tokyo to rescue Hikaru . He 's so unreliable ! What 's going to happen to my daughter ? Hikaru ! Banta ! If you die , what am I supposed to do ? Banta ! Please , professor ! Professor , can 't you do something ? Let 's do it ! Use the Spin Saucer . Spin Saucer ? First lure the Space Beast to the sky , then use Spin Saucer to cut off its legs . At the same time , Kouji can push the tour bus out . Then Grendizer will rescue the bus . Exactly , but it 's extremely dangerous . There 's no room for error ! Did you hear that Kouji ? I sure did ! We must time this carefully . I 'm counting on you ! Space Thunder ! I 've lured the Saucer Beast to the sky . You must hurry , Kouji ! Were almost out of oxygen , and the spikes are coming down on us . Kouji , are you okay ? I must do this . Hurry ! Okay then ! If I want to rescue them , I have to do something about this smoke . Hurry , Duke Freed ! Spin Saucer ! He did it ! Do it now , Kouji ! Okay , let 's go ! I did my part . It 's up to you now , Duke Freed ! Okay ! Chute In ! Daizer Go ! Now that the hostages are safe , I won 't hold back ! Melt Shower ! Hand Beam ! Launch missiles ! Don 't get too close ! It 's dangerous ! Duke Freed , you can attack the neck now ! Okay ! Double Harken ! How dare you fail us , Bracki . You let those Earthlings go . Sir , I am sorry , Sir . " A man amongst all other men " So , you 're Kouji ? You saved my son , you 're like a god to us . I 'm going to kiss you ! Don 't be so shy ! I didn 't do anything ! Really ! He 's so humble saying he didn 't help in the rescue . Speaking of rescue , where were you during the whole thing ? Yuke Yuke Duke Freed . Tobe Tobe Grendizer . Daichi To Umi To Aozora To . Tome To Chkatta Keno Heiwa . Mamori Mo Kataku Tachiagare .

Surely I will destroy Duke Fleed this time and invade the Earth or I will lose my position . No I will not let Duke Fleed escape from my hand this time . Commander Blacki . What is it ? An object is flying on top of the Mothers Ship ! Maybe it 's trying to follow us . What ? A suspicious flying saucer ! It is a flying saucer ! Let Minifo launch as a precaution ! Yes , Sir . He is tempting us to fight . Attack ! Which accursed one is that ? He doesn 't realize how dreadful the United Vegan Forces are I will throw it in his face ! Damn you . All Minifo mobilize . Blacki ! Hurry and open the hatch ! Did you forget the crest ? Oh it is the mark of the Special Guards ! Alright , open the hatch . Open it right away . Yes . Sir ! Open the hatch immediately . Yes , Sir . Why did he come here ? If only I could know . Could it be ? Pleased with meeting you Blacki . You landed here from the Vegan Nebula , how does this happen ? Yes I landed by order of the Great Vega . What ? By an order of the Great Vega ? You mean you were ordered to bring down the Minifo and the UFO beast ? No Blacki , I came to examine your true ability . It was weak as I expected . Blacki I assessed the impossibility of your defeating Duke Fleed with your strength . Take heed of your words German ! You take heed of your language Blacki ! Don 't forget that I am here by orders of Vega ! From now on I will take command of your forces . Do you understand Blacki ? Follow the orders from here on . But there is a system for the forces ... Blacki ! The Special Guards are under the direct orders of the Great Vega . Therefore , you must receive the orders of Captain Gorman by order of the Great Vega . Do you understand Blacki ? General Gandal ! Blacki let ( Jin Jin ) await the chance for the attack . We will go tomorrow . I will rest for tomorrow . Yes , Sir . My fears have come true , what I should do ? If he destroys Duke Fleed I will lose my position as a Commander . Duke Fleed , your life has ended ; you will be killed and will go to hell . Then by force I will rule the Earth . It was a nightmare . Which omen of misfortune is this ? An undefeatable enemy that I haven 't fought before . He is approaching Earth to kill me . I desire a peaceful life on this beautiful Earth , but ... There is no way to escape from fighting . Even if I lose my life . My fate is to fight to realize justice . Let 's move , hurry , let 's go now . Let 's go to the pasture . Yes , the Vega , now begins the fighting ! How careless you are ! Pour for me again ! As you wish , Sir . Forbiddance ; it is impossible for an ignorant one like you to defeat Grendizer . You only hide behind the guards . Oh where is UFO ? UFO where are you ? The time has come my dear UFO for you to appear . Come on appear , UFO , appear ... UFO ! Oh what happened to you Father ? UFO , UFO ... Shouting in a work day like today ? What 's wrong with you ? Stop it and come to help me Father . Hikaru why wouldn 't he do that ? Studying the UFO is the source of his happiness , I am sure of that ... But ! A UFO ! Finally the UFO has appeared ! UFO HAS APPEARED ! My friends have come , how much I miss you . Huh ? This UFO is weird ! A strange crest is on the center , it seems like a crest of a star in a circle . What ? It seems like a star crest ? It must be the crest of the special guards who destroyed Planet Fleed . My apprehension was in its place . This guard that is under the order of the Great Vega , he is coming to kill me . Where are you going Daisuke ? Hikaru , don 't tell Kouji that the UFO came close to Earth , understood ? Daisuke ! When the UFO appears Daisuke is absent ; and this is a strange matter . Kouji ? Daisuke why don 't you request from me to fight along with you ? Because this UFO is not an ordinary beast . Nobody besides me should get killed , did you understand ? Daisuke ... If you died I die too . Won 't you be more frank ? You don 't understand ! If the worst happens , you must live to protect humanity from the enemy . DAMN ! Daisuke I won 't allow you to die before my eyes no matter what you say ! Kouji . Where is Daisuke ? He went ; he intends to fight the enemy alone by sacrificing his life . The time is late now . I want to return him if I am able to . Duke Fleed ! They say that the special guards of the UFO beast is of terrible strength . Not just TFO , even Grendizer cannot sustain them . And this is Daisuke 's opinion . He doesn 't want you to face the danger of death . Okay here we go . Grendizer Go . And now all we can do is pray until he is victorious . Daisuke , please come back alive . The time to withdraw has passed , I will proceed even if I lose my life , my fate is to fight for the sake of justice . The United Vegan Forces are coming . Do you come here to meet your elimination Duke Fleed ? NOW all Minifo , attack him . Followers of Vega , I will proceed ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Spin Saucer . Space Thunder . DAMN YOU ! Duke Fleed ! The time has come for you to die a horrible death . Space Thunder . The Space Thunder doesn 't work ! No weapon has any power in front of our super weapons . DAMN YOU ! Screw Crusher Punch !

Patience has reached its limit and end ! Kouji stop ! But Daisuke ... I cannot see him fight more like this . I share the feeling but TFO cannot sustain the enemy ! DAMN ! Daisuke difficulties will face you if you continue . Withdraw now Daisuke ! Spazer Cross ! Shoot Out . Anti-Radar Mist ! Duke Fleed , when I want to kill you then you must be killed ! Alright , we will return now . When I discover his place , I will attack him anytime I wish . Daisuke you must withdraw , DAISUKE ! Gorman my friend . I think you have lost the aim , unfortunately you couldn 't beat Grendizer . Blacki . Get off the chair ! WHAT ? It is for the Commander of the Mother Ship . And I am the Commander ! Hurry and leave the chair , do you stand in my face ? ! Damn I will show you . You slap me ! Yes I did . Blacki after reinforcing ( Jin Jin ) , we will go . Get Ready ! Prepare ( Jin Jin ) for action . Get ready , let 's go ! Yes . Sir ! I will prevent him from landing . Duke Fleed surely I will defeat you . I will not allow you to kill Duke Fleed ! Duke Fleed , I will send you to hell soon . Alright , let 's launch ! What is it ? Look over there Professor . What is that ? A heat probing device . Heat probing ? Is it for probing heat emanating from a flying saucer ? Yes it is . Yes , it must have been launched to discover Grendize base . DAMN ! I will destroy it with a missile . Professor , a UFO has appeared . A UFO is headed for the laboratory ! What ? ! DAMN ! Duke Fleed , I will follow you immediately . We are now at a distance of 10 kilometers . You discovered us too late . Duke Fleed is surely nearby . Kouji , get back here ! Don 't be reckless ! You are incapable with TFO ! Death is sweet to me in protecting Grendizer . Kouji , I will not allow you to die alone ! Are you sure of his defeat , Daisuke ? Yes , but Father I will not allow him to die without saving him . Allow me to fight with him Father ! DAISUKE ! Daisuke ... Here I go . Followers of Vega , TFO MISSILE ROCKET ! Where is Duke Fleed ? I know he is nearby . If you don 't want death , tell me where he is ! I am not stupid , even if you killed me I will not tell you where is Duke Fleed . Stop your arrogance ; do you want to be crushed to death ? If you want salvation , you must summon Duke Fleed ! If you want to stay alive summon Duke Fleed right away . No matter what comes out of you , I will not do what you say . Why don 't you proceed and crush me ? How do you risk your life to save a spaceman ? Because we trust each other . We spread love and peace on this Earth . You are determined to meet death . Duke Fleed , this time you will die a horrible death ! Stop ! Desist , Daisuke ! Kouji we will both die together . Let 's go Duke Fleed ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! Double Hand BEAM ! Space Thunder ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! Duke Fleed ... Now you will not escape from death . DAISUKE ! Minifo ... Have you gone mad ? The enemy is Grendizer ! Captain Gorman . My current enemy is you !

You cursed BRAT ... Duke Fleed , I am the one who kills you ! SPACE THUNDER ! The minds of peace and true justice defeated the minds of war and aggression . What ? Captain Gorman was defeated ? Yes , he fought bravely but he was defeated . Even the special guard was incapable of defeating Duke Fleed ? General Gandal , I am sure of the defeat of Duke Fleed . I am depending on you , Blacki . Yes , Sir . I will not allow anyone to defeat Duke Fleed . I will defeat him ; I am the one who will defeat Duke Fleed . I am Blacki the only one will do it .

Then , I will help you , okay ? Hikaru ! What are you doing here , huh ? I understand now why you are so late ! Oh , I thought that with my help he will finish early , Father . Leave him to finish his work ! Neither Daisuke nor any other person ! Regardless the distance , the relationship is close between the man and the woman . You will not be this way as long as lam alive ! Get away from him ! You must not be with him , even for three seconds . Pardon me . Ah , Daisuke ! Watch out from him , Hikaru ! What do you mean ? Kouji ! Wait ! What are you doing here Daisuke ? Why the rush ? Where are you going ? I will head off to find out the truth . A mysterious gas is floating in outer space , didn 't you notice it ? What ? A mysterious gas ? Yes it is , get out of my way , I am in a hurry . Wait a moment , Kouji . I will go and perform some research on it for you . Wait for me . No thank you , Daisuke . The worst hasn 't happened yet , I will do it myself . KOUJI ! You know that you cannot go into outer space with TFO now ! Let me go ! Stop it . KOUJI ! Good bye Daisuke . Kouji . Oh Kouji , what are you doing to yourself ? Don 't have ill thoughts of me Daisuke . I must do what I have determined to please myself . Father . Daisuke , what has happened for you to get annoyed ? Kouji launched into outer space in TFO now . What ? What happened ? The mysterious manifestation in outer space is linked with the United Vegan Forces . Yes Father , I assess this matter . No , I am not sure . It seems like it is a natural manifestation . What a comrade he is . Hurry and call him , Daisuke . Okay . Tell me the altitude that TFO has reached , Hayashi . Yes . The altitude has reached 30.000 meters and he is still rising . My God , if he continues rising ... Now Hayashi , let me connect with Kouji , right away . Here you go . Hello , Kouji , Kouji ! Daisuke here , answer me , Kouji , respond ! Kouji , Kouji , return now ! Do you hear me , Kouji ? Return now , now KOUJI ! I can 't . When I insist , I don 't return until I reach my goal ! He is increasing his speed . Ah , Kouji ! Do what I am telling you . TFO cannot withstand high altitude as you know . Don 't be anxious , Daisuke . I will return as soon as I accomplish my goal . Kouji , do you want to die ? Commander Blacki , a small saucer is coming toward us ! He erred in knowing his limits , leave him where he is . The barrier will hold him . It will be a disaster if Grendizer knows about the space mine , hurry ! Yes , Sir ! When the radar doesn 't work on Earth , Grendizer will surely appear . At that point I will eliminate him . If I am able to do that , I will take everything on Earth . DAMN IT ! Oh that 's the mysterious gas ! Now I will go to see what 's going on . DAMN ! Ah , what is that ? The gage has malfunctioned ! KOUJI RETURN AT ONCE ! COME BACK NOW ! What the hell happened to you ? ! I have reached here after a great effort . Oh , also this one malfunctioned ! I am losing control . What is this ? My God ! Come quickly , Father ! Come quickly ! A malfunction has hit TFO ! Come close ! What is it Daisuke ? Look , look in the sky ! What happened , huh ? What happened ? My God ! Let 's go and save him . Get ready all of you . Here I go . Hey , how don 't you notice me ? Hurry Daisuke ! Okay . Here I go , I am coming ! He beat me ! Hey Kouji , pull yourself together , help me ! Daisuke ... I see something abnormal ... What ? How is that ? How does it look like ? Tell me ! Tell me about how it looks ! It is ... it looks like a ... Hey , Kouji ! Stop , Daisuke ! He is wounded . Don 't shake him like that . But , fortunately for him , his wounds are light . Help me , let 's go . I admire his impulsion . He is like a wild horse in the West . Besides Kouji , you are nothing Daisuke . And now proceed to aid him gently , eh ? Daisuke and I are beside you . Finally I have finished . Kouji has returned . Goro , come and help me immediately ! Here I come . He has returned now . Hurry to put him down , hurry ! Kouji ... I will bring the doctor right away . Wait a moment , Hikaru . He will be fine , a small wound . I am sure of his healing . I trained myself in the West , Hikaru . But you are licensed as a vet and not a doctor . Idiot ! Idiot ! The living things are similar . Hikaru , first , the wound must be disinfected . Alright . Bring some sterilizers , it must be somewhere here . Wait a moment . Where did I put it ? Oh here it is . Alright , let 's do it now and clear his wounds . Father what the hell you are doing ? This is alcohol drink ; we can 't clear the wounds with it . Can 't you read here ? It is a perfect cleaner for bacteria and wounds . Okay here I go . Oh by wrong ! Oh how careless you are ! Let us get a real doctor and not a joke ! Shut up ! Don 't disturb me while I am doing ... You are making yourself a joke , eh ? Kouji ! Hikaru , leave it to me I will treat his wound right away . STOP IT , stop having fun ! What did you call me ? Judging on what I heard from him , Father it seems like a very abnormal UFO . And as I expected , the mysterious gas is what stopped the radar , my son . I think that it is coming from the United Vegan Forces . But why doesn 't the radar work ? That is strange . I am sorry for causing you a great harm . But would you go there ? Did you understand ? Yes , I understand . Duke Freed ' . ! Grendizer Go . I am very happy for Kouji 's salvation . NO ! NO ! Don 't get up , Kouji ! Don 't get up ! Danbi I am alright now . No ! No way , you need to rest , you must lie down . No Danbi , I am alright now and I thank you greatly . Hello , Dr.Umon. Be gentle with talk to him , Danbi . Be gentle . Go ahead Professor , you can talk to him quietly and I will supervise outside of the room . Okay , let us go kids . It is a daring request , Kouji , isn 't that so ? How is your wound ? I am alright now . Where is Daisuke I wonder ? He went to investigate the gas in the outer space . WHAT ? ! Professor Umon , there is something strange this is dispersed beside the gas . What ? ! It is like a floating Earth satellite , or like a mine in the seal something suspicious . Very bad ! Daisuke went now to look for the mysterious gas ... And he doesn 't know that they are launching dangerous things . Professor let me go a second time ! Don 't be hasty . I won 't let you go there because it is extremely dangerous . But ! If it wasn 't for my failure , then Daisuke wouldn 't receive such an awaiting occurrence . Thank you Kouji . Promise me that you won 't be reckless . As soon as you are able to connect with Daisuke , you must return with him . Father , let me enter the room please , I want to give this drink to the Professor and Kouji . No way , you can 't enter the room without permission . They have a serious conversation . I will serve them . What the hell ? Where are they ? What happened ? They disappeared ! I wonder if Professor and Kouji got kidnapped ? They have gone from the window ! Oh I couldn 't hear them escaping from the window ! Take caution , Daisuke . Oh what is that ? Now I know what the mysterious gas is ! I am ready for any emergency with Grendizer ! Commander Blacki , I found Grendizer . He is located at point 713 . And finally he made himself fall into the trap . I am Blacki , General Gandal . What happened ? Don 't you have any good news about Grendizer ? Yes . This time , I will eliminate the hateful Grendizer . Oh , proceed . I expect your success ! Tell me about the plan that you drew against him . I will make the space mines stick on Grendizer . Then , I will blow him up at a close point to Earth . Alright , a good idea . Do what is in your capacity , Commander Blacki . You will sacrifice him so that Vega can invade the World . Alright ! All Minifo attacks now , we will lure Grendizer . Yes , Sir ! Horoma , Okaro , Esora , Otowa , go ! What is that ? The mistake in the gage . There must be something hiding . Melt Shower . Spin Saucer . He hasn 't discovered them yet , now is the chance . Engage the preparations for the suction of the space mines , GO ! Set ON ! Hand Beam . Are you able to connect with the two , Yamada ? Not yet , the electric beam waves did not return to their normal state . It is impossible to receive correct conditions at an altitude of 230,000 meters . And finally I defeated them all . I am surprised at their strong resistance despite their many losses . Huh ? What is that ? Daisuke ! Daisuke ! This is Kouji , please respond . I wonder who they are ? They are like floating space mines in outer space . They are evil . Hand Beam . Power is shot out at zero ! I will destroy them all ! Ah , the needle is pointing at the red zone , DAMN ! DAISUKE ! I will crash if I continue descending . What should I do ? DAMN ! What is this ? What is happening ? ! I am falling because of the weight . Duke Freed . You learned to fear the space mines ! The space mine ? If I use full power I will destroy them . Duke ... Dizer GO ! Set On ! The Magnetic Wave ! There is no use of fighting now . Surrender now . You are not able to use any weapon nor escape from there ! Daisuke , tell me what I can do to serve you ! IDIOT ! I told you to get away from me . They will make me come close to Earth and then blow me up , hurry and escape ! You should not be involved . No I will not , I want to help you Daisuke ! SHUT UP ! Get away from here right now ! Commander Blacki , the small saucer is following Grendizer . Damn both of them ! Allow the UFO beast ( Dol Dol ) to kill him ! And Grendizer will be eliminated immediately ! Set ON ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ! Watch out Daisuke ! WATCH OUT DAISUKE ! Grendizer will crash on Earth and scatter , watch out ! DAMN ! There is only one way left for me . Here I go ! Daisuke , you will crash on Earth ! Daisuke watch out ! Then , I must aim an impact to him . DANGER ! Kouji ! Kouji , hurry up and escape ! No way , I am a man ; I can 't give my back to the enemy ! Hey YOU ! I don 't fear such a red octopus ! The way you fear ! SHOOT IN ! Dizer GO ! Damn , you red octopus I am not going to be killed like this ! Shoulder Boomerang . Anti-G gravity Storm ! Alright , the gas barrier deactivated because of the power of the explosion . I thank you for saving me . No , Daisuke , I am humbled , lam another Daisuke .

Commander Minao go , I don 't await your return , let 's go ! Alright ! Professor the Moon 's color is still red , and this means something strange . Daisuke , do you know more about Vega ? Accurate information is necessary . Even about Planet Fleed . It 's not possible for us to know more than Duke Fleed . This means that we always have to be careful in planning our tactics . Professor Umon . You must strike ; before they do anything ! Kouji . It is better that you don 't belittle Vega 's forces . The field of work against them is limited . What are you supposed to do ? Knowing everything about them . Everything ? Yes , this is our only way to a safer arrangement . Professor , The Mother Ship is on the screen ! What ? ! What are you going to do , Daisuke ? It gives me to know that some of those who are innocent will suffer because I am here . That is what I feel Kouji . Daisuke . Before that , what do we do when The Mother Ship comes close ? Kouji , leave them to me . You mean that , by yourself ? Yes , I am thinking of doing something . You are thinking of something ? Yes , if their mechanical beast comes out , we will capture it alive . Do you understand me , Kouji ? Capture it alive ? Yes , and we will capture the pilots if they are inside it . Even the pilots ? Yes , even the pilots . All Vegan guard machines are pilots , we capture them and we will know something about them . This is what we have to do , Kouji . This is what we have to do ? ! Here I go . Alright , we will distract them while you exit , and this will give you time to capture Grendizer . Yes , Commander Blacki . Commander Blacki , where do we attack ? Where do we attack ? We attack where we can defeat Duke Fleed and wherever we find him . Commander Blacki , are you ready ? Alright , all Minifo starts ! Oh , the Minifo ! Welcome my friends ! Do you want to talk ? Where are you going , Mr.UFO ? Welcome ! Welcome ! My beloved ! My friends ! Come closer . Oh , it 's a flying saucer ... DAMN ! Outrageous ! What are they attacking a school ? Huh ? ! Alright !

Strange , how do I bring her out to treat her ? You will die ! Are you thinking of what you are doing ? Who are you ? I am Commander Minao , The Vegan Forces Commander ! Come with me , I have to tell you something . Let go of me ! Let go of me ! TFO ? Kouji returned . Come here ! Hey , what are you doing here ? Come and look ! Watch out Daisuke ! What happened to ( Gil Gil ) ? The connection has been lost . Doesn 't it look like she self-destructed ? We have no connection with her . What happened to Minao ? Huh ? Where am I ? Where am I ? Control yourself . Take it easy , you are in my house . Come with me to the doctor . Leave me alone . No , no helping the wounded is an obligation upon us on Earth . Yes that 's right . Listen Kouji , borrow some clothes from Hikaru , she doesn 't need military clothes in this land of peace here . Okay . What happened ? Look , Father . This is my Father . Kill me quickly if you dare ! I don 't want to be made fun of ! Hurry and kill me immediately . Please wait . Kill me immediately ! Kill me . It appears that the Vegan leaders have destroyed Planet Ruby . I am correct Minao . It seems like you are thinking of death . They have brainwashed you . You are on Earth , not where you used to be . You must learn to live and to think of life , you are wounded and exhausted . Retire to rest , please . Come with me . I brought to you these clothes ; put them on while I am out of the room . When you finish just call me . Take it easy , take it easy ! Or else you can 't move forward . Father , you take it easy too . What 's wrong with you ? That 's right . Danbi , observe proper etiquette . Leave her alone . She is in our care . Why Professor ? We are used to entertaining all guests , isn 't that right ? You might be right ... What is that ? You are better now , Minao . This is Hikaru , the one who lent you the clothes . I am happy to see you . And I am her brother , Goro . Let me introduce you to ... This is Bunta , one of my friends . This is Minao . Kouji ! Introduce her to me ! Don 't leave me hanging ! I am Danbi Makiba ! Nice to meet you all . Isn 't she an amazing girl ? You remind me of a beautiful lady I met in the West named Mary ; her eyes are like yours , beautiful ... Father ! Minao , you are wounded . We all want to make it easy on you and help you . You have done well , Hikaru . That is great ; a wonderful memory that will retain . What happened , Blacki ? Did you kill Duke Fleed ? She made a mistake , too . She made a grave mistake . What did you say ? What happened to Commander Minao ? She is missing . She went missing after her landing on Earth . We are striving to connect with her . Search for her ! And if you find her alive , let her finish her mission . Did you understand ? If she is dead , then launch an all-o out attack to take revenge . Yes , Sir . Minao , come and join us in dancing . Yes hurry , hurry . Sorry but I can 't because I am tired . You have to destroy Grendizer and Duke Fleed together ! If you do well , then I promise you not to attack your Planet Ruby , eh ? Don 't forget that , eh ? Where are you going ? What happened ? Ah , Daisuke ! Commander Minao ! Commander Minao ! Commander Minao is there a mistake ? Answer me immediately . Minao ! This is Blacki , answer me ! Are you Minao ? Yes , Sir . Why don 't you respond ? Sorry , Commander . Do you have problems ? No . Why you didn 't respond then ? Yes , Sir . Did you forget our promise ? What is the matter with you ? Of course I did not forget Commander Blacki , I found someone who looks like Duke Fleed , and I am pursuing him now . I see , I wish for your success . In any case , don 't forget that the future of Ruby Planet depends on you ! Yes , Sir . Who is that ? Daisuke ... Minao , I heard what you were talking about . I thought you were Duke Fleed . I am correct . There is no doubt that you know Planet Ruby . All the people here don 't know this . Correct I am the Duke Fleed . If you don 't kill me , then you will not return to Planet Ruby . Yes , I have to die , but not now . Now or never . Kill him ! Kill him ! No ... How can I kill such a good young man like him ? Duke Fleed . I can 't kill you , you are such a kind man , brave and honest , I just can 't do it . Minao ! Good night . You may stay here forever , if you wanted to . Good night . Remember that the fate of Planet Ruby is in your hand , Minao . I don 't have the willpower to kill him . But , what will happen to Planet Ruby ? I cannot . Even if I was happy here . What will happen to the inhabitants of Ruby ? Oh , what should I do ? Remember that the fate of Planet Ruby is in your hand , Minao . Forgive me , Daisuke . Mi ... Minao ... Forgive me , Daisuke . I can 't do anything else . Minao ! Good bye Daisuke , I must leave now or they will kill me and you . Minaou Sorry but I have to go . Minao , wait ! STOP ! MINAO ! Minao ! COME BACK !

Do you allow me to board if I find the other one ? You will be the best of our friends . He is tempting Shinishi to find Grendizer ... Now that we have found TFO there , Grendizer is not far . Why don 't you carry out a random annihilating bomb ? Not a good idea ! General Gandal ! These bombs don 't destroy Grendizer , we must insist on reaching the shelter and we have to destroy it completely ! Then I will tempt the boy to spy over there , so he will be our servant . That will be better . Oh , Lady Gandal ! The boy 's mind is taken by the UFO . It is true that he is small , but nobody changes his thinking . Watch him closely . Yes , Sir !

Enemy wants to make Grendizer stuck in the space and kill him with a very power full gun using Saucer beast ( Bari Bari ) . But as usual TFO helps him a little bit so he could escape from there trap . Don 't miss the next episode of UFO Robo Grendizer . The Evil Ones Are intercepting The Burning Sun . Good bye till next time . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Eleven . The Evil Ones are intercepting the Burning Sun . Damn you Duke Fleed . I won 't be please even if I tear you apart . DAMN ! Blacki ... What are you doing ? Come to the control room immediately . Yes , Sir ! I am coming . In any case , I will be blamed . All of this because of that accursed Duke Fleed . He has scoffed at me . DAMN ! Come here Blacki . I am sorry , I feel tired because I did not sleep well . Blacki ... Instead of your sleep , you must think of a way that enables you to seize Duke Fleed . After that you sleep happily . I am sorry General . Prepare yourself immediately . Yes , Sir ! Destroy the main observatories on Earth . I will prepare myself and destroy them ... Wait , Blacki . Do you understand what I say ? Loot at this . This video was taken on Earth a long time ago . The moon , where we established our base , falls between the sun and the Earth . And the moon is covering the sun gradually . This phenomenon is called the solar eclipse on Earth . The theory is very simple and it can be displayed in this fashion . At the time , the inhabitants of Earth will be able to ... engage an astronomical observation of the total solar eclipse tomorrow . Blacki ... Yes , Sir . We don 't want the inhabitants of Earth to go any more deeply into the realities of space than what already happened . Yes , Sir . We must hide . Hide ? Yes we have to . Your mission will be to destroy the observatories on Japan So Duke Fleed and Grendizer can 't see them and something else .. Something else ? Yes . Lure Duke Fleed into the true shadow of the moon at 3 : 10 PM according to Earth time before the solar eclipse . General Gandal ? On the true shadow of the moon ? Correct . In other words , to this point . If we succeed in our mission ... Then we are doe with Duke Fleed and Grendizer together ; and victory will be ours . In other words , various changes occur in places of the true shadow ... And half of the shadow that is caused by the moon during the solar eclipse . Did you understand ? General Gandal , what does this mean ? I want to know everything in this matter . Alright . The formidable changes are the changes in the ionosphere and a deficiency in the solar radiation . Then we lure Duke Fleed . The internal structure of Grendizer will be affected by the amounts of solar radiation . General Gandal , the inventors of Grendizer did not take into consideration the effects of a solar eclipse . I know that this very well and I noticed them . This time I will destroy Duke Fleed . Blacki ... Get ready to execute the plan ! Yes , Sir ! What are you doing , Father , huh ? I will use this during the observation of the solar eclipse tomorrow . Oh , you are spending a long time ; you can save time by you going to the institute . Be silent ! I know that . But this makes me happier . Goro , don 't interfere with my affairs ! Huh ? I don 't understand ! What do you mean ? And when did you ever understand ? Huh ? That is Daisuke that is playing the guitar ? Where is Hikaru ? I don 't know . Hikaru ! Another time ! What a beautiful moon it is like a mirror . I wish I can see our hearts reflect on its surface . Everything is ready . I fear that the Vegan forces will plan something and that is by using the solar eclipse tomorrow . What is running through your mind , Daisuke ? Huh ? Concerning the solar eclipse tomorrow , it is the first time that I see the eclipse . What ? About this thing ? It is the solar eclipse that happens once every so many years . This time we will observe the eclipse in Japan . And we will be in need of help . So Kouji and I have to be at the institute tomorrow . My assumption failed , Daisuke , I thought you were feeling some romance . Hikaru ... How many times do you make me repeat the same thing ? I will not forgive you again . Daisuke are you ready for the challenge ? What are you going to do , Father ? You be quiet . Hikaru let me go , let me go ... You are very jealous , Father ! This is my affection towards you . Any reaction from Earth ? No , reaction whatsoever . Work on the preparedness of the implementation to observe the solar eclipse ! Everyone , prepare for the battle ! Everyone , prepare for the battle ! Everyone , prepare for the battle ! Everyone , prepare for the battle ! Ready ? Our first operation will be to destroy the observatories ! And when we launch towards air space , everyone must exert the utmost effort ! Strange , what is that ? The birds and animals know that a solar eclipse is about to happen how smart they are .. Oh , the moon only covers the sun from the Earth , Father . You are less smart than birds , Goro ! What , what ? Huh ? Look ! It is the opposite way , Father . Ah , I understand ... I knew that there something wrong . Huh ? The eclipse started ! The eclipse started ! An , I envy Kouji and Daisuke . You are stubborn , Goro . Isn 't that the Mother Ship ? Daisuke , no it is not clear . That was something that was perhaps caused by the eclipse . Kouji . We have to register this in our reports . Yes , Sir . Something horrible , Professor ! What happened , Kouji ? The observatories on Earth are exploding one after another ! What ? It is possible that they will be here soon ! I will undergo a reconnaissance trip with TFO , Professor . Not you , but Daisuke . Stay here and complete gathering the information . I will leave now . Duke Fleed . Grendizer Go . Melt Shower ! Grendizer is appearing . Alright , in order to attack him , we must lure him to the true shadow of the moon . Yes , Sir . Spin Saucer . Spin Drill . Damn ! I can return them with TFO ! Daisuke , don 't chase them far ; I don 't care for them unless they are between us and the observation . I got that . I want to eliminate the Mother Ship today . Everyone calm down and follow up the observation , our role has been multiplied after destruction of all observatories . The solar eclipse will begin in a minute , Professor ! Alright , prepare for me the horizontal telescope that was installed recently . Yes , Sir . Commander Blacki , this person has arrived at the shadow of the moon . Alright , eliminate him ! After a minute , everything will be done . UFO Beast ( Bari Bari ) be ready to launch . Commander , it is the total solar eclipse now ! Are you ready to die , Grendizer ? What happened ? Professor . Something striking with Grendizer ! What ? Yamada , turn towards Grendizer please . Yes , Sir . DAMN ! What happened to Grendizer ? What happened ? Professor , let me go to him ! What are you saying , Kouji ? Professor , the location of Grendizer is in the ionosphere in the shadow of the moon ! Changes occurred as a result of the solar eclipse . Professor , let me go to him . If we leave Grendizer as is , it will become a prey for them ! But Kouji , with TFO you can 't . You think that TFO is incapable ? I know this ; I know it is capability of flying . I will go now ! Kouji ! The power is decreasing quickly . What happened , huh ? Withdraw , Daisuke , or you will be eliminated ! Daisuke ! Spin Saucer ... Melt Shower ... Professor , communications have halted with Grendizer . What ? Wait for me , Daisuke ! Wait ! Prepare ( Bari Bari ) . Keep Grendizer in the ionosphere ! Yes , Sir ! Ah . Kouji , did the observation finish ? Hey , Kouji , do you have a guest ? I would like to welcome him ! Kouji , what is it ? Is he a spaceman ? What a marvelous spaceman and he will visit the Earth on the day of the solar eclipse . Welcome . What happiness and luck of Danbi ! He does not know anything about what will face Daisuke . Kouji , hurry ! Grendizer cannot use its weapons ! What , huh ? Kouji , I think Grendizer 's system has malfunctioned because of the ionosphere and these results from the solar eclipse . The solar engine can be turned on when absorbing power from the solar rays , where the sun is covered by the moon . I got that . I will exert my utmost effort to help Daisuke ! Alright , let it be the finishing blow . Prepare to fire the beam gun ! Prepare to fire the beam gun ! Open the area of caution ! Open the area of caution ! What happened ? Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! No use ! Kouji , Grendizer is not moving , in any case , keeping distant from them is more important . Alright , I got that . DAMN ! This is the trick of the ionosphere because of the solar eclipse . No ready yet ? After a moment ! Alright . And finally , Grendizer ! Oh , what is that ? What is happening ? Commander , it is a small saucer ! Don 't worry . Fire the beam gun ! But ... Don 't worry , hurry ! Yes , Sir ! Fire the beam gun ! Fire the beam gun ! Oh . Kouji ! Yahoo , it is a success ! No , Kouji , don 't come near here . I will try to free Grendizer out of the shadow of the moon by using energy-free TFO missiles ! Stop , Kouji ! What are you doing ? Now I understand . Thank you , Kouji . Commander , a considerable saucer ! It is annoying . Alright , let ( Bari Bari ) eliminate it , we will let the Mother Ship take care of Grendizer . Yes , Sir ! Daisuke , ten more minutes . The sun will return to its normal state within ten minutes . Kouji , maintain your remoteness until that time . Alright , I got that . Alright , fire the beam gun ! Look what I did ! Damn , this time as well . Keep him inside the shadow of the moon ! What gratitude ; it has regained its power . Spin Drill . Spin Saucer . DAMN IT ! The sun is appearing ! Hurry up please . Damn ! I must save Daisuke by whatever means . DAMN ! The sun rays are located outside the shadow of the moon ! I understood ! It is better to send this over there ! I will take the opportunity ! Be patient , Daisuke ! I will give them a wonderful present ! Commander , that is the small saucer ! Don 't get annoyed , it has no effect on ( Bari Bari ) . Alright , now the beam gun is excellent . We must succeed this time ! An artificial beam ! I understand now , Kouji is moving the sun rays . Alright , I won 't let you down . I will exert my effort to tolerate it as much as possible . Let me annoy them , Kouji . Shoot In ! Dizer GO ! Why do you move slowly ? Let ( Bari Bari ) bring him back ! Yes , Sir ! Spazer Cross . Screw Crusher Punch . Spazer Cross . And finally the sun rays have appeared ! He is flying with the sun rays . Quickly capture him . Blacki ... Yes , Sir . What happened ? Why this disorder ? Did the sun appear again ? Please wait , we will take more time . Alight will make ( Bari Bari ) explode with Grendizer , it will be over ! I have to do something . They will make the saucer beast blow up Grendizer and blow itself up . Anti-G gravity Storm . DAMN YOU ! Dizer Jump . Spazer Cross . You idiot ! The reason for your error is the small saucer . Why didn 't you take that into consideration ? What ? You planned for everything in this operation , but you didn 't take into consideration that small saucer . And the result is that you lost ! Lady Gandal ... Don 't give me excuses ; you have to go to the next plan . Return immediately ! But ... What is happening ? Yes ! It looks like Grendizer gave us a direct hit ! Damn you Duke Fleed . Commander , there are some malfunctions in our spaceship ! We will withdraw at the present time , but I will eliminate them with whatever means next time ! Daisuke , don 't chase them far ! We can eliminate them at any time . Don 't worry ; I will take care of it . Stop ! You will be killed ! Don 't get in my way , Kouji ! Alright with the apology , I will go next time . You have achieved a victory ! UFO ! UFO ! Kirisake ikari no DABURU HAAKEN . Tatakae GRENDIZER . Mou yurusenai . Hatenai kurasa no uchuu kuukan . Ima koso GRENDIZER , Hikari o tomose .

A saucer beast attacks a family who enjoys there Christmas party . Daisuke went to check what happened there at the mountain . He found a beautiful girl laying down on the snow . That girl kept lighting the fire to remember her parents and the saucer beast . Duke Fleed do your best . Don 't miss the next episode of UFO Robo Grendizer . A Girl Crosses Over The Rainbow Bridge . Good bye till next time . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Twelve . A Girl Crosses Over The Rainbow Bridge . It is finished now . Let 's light it . Ah , it is wonderful . It is very beautiful . I like it . Miuke , what do you want your present to be in the Christmas ? You have to ask it now so Santa could bring it to you . It a memorial booklet , huh ? What I wish for my present is here inside of it . Huh ? What is that wish you hide ? It is a secret . What ? Santa Clause ... Please make it come true . What is happening ? What is that ? It is an Earthquake ! Mama ... Miuke ... This is Boki Dik observatory ! There is a big earthquake here ! The information did not reveal that an earthquake happened in the area of Mount Boki Dik . Be careful for the situation is not free from suspicion . Roger . A helicopter was launched there for rescuing . Saucer Beast ( Gani Gani ) , hide yourself ! An avalanche ; a girl lying on the snow . Let me down . I will descend to save her . Oh , she is still alive ! Okay . ( Gani Gani ) operation immediately , let 's go ! This is for you , take it please . Tell me what happened in the Mountain ? Try to remember . Poor girl , she has lost her memories . After pondering , it seems impossible that a building drifts down from mountaintop with an avalanche . Recall ! Try ! That is a lot . She must have been very scared . She is affected with cerebral hemorrhage . It is not possible to leave her in this way . You mean the operation ? The chances of success are 50 % . We have no option except the operation , Doctor . Bu the girl is very exhausted ; she must take a little reset first . The success of the operation depends on her brain 's strength . We are in need of her bravery to pull through the operation and of her will to live . What do you think of staying at the green pasture some time until she heals ? Good idea . We are sure that Grendizer 's base falls within a 100 kilometer range of the center of Mount Boki Dik . Therefore , we will establish the radar base on Mount Boki Dik to find the place of Grendizer . And fire a missile from there . I see , it is an excellent idea , really . Thank you very much for your compliment of us , Sir . Your idea is excellent , Lady Gandal . It surpassed Duke Fleed . Yes , Sir . I have confidence in you , Lady Gandal . She is meddlesome . I am here , I am flying . Oh slow down you will kill me ... No no don 't worry I won 't ... Where are you going Miuke ? Leave her alone , this beautiful nature is the only salutation to make her heal very fast , after she lost her memories . What a poor girl ... BU NT A ' . ! It is not the time to cry , we have to make for her a present for the Christmas time . Did you understand ? I will make for her cake , this is the best I can do . I am coming to help you Hikaru . Leave Hikaru , you have now to pull me up slowly . I hate this job ; I hate it so much ... Don 't pull me so hard ; don 't pull me so fast ... You stupid ... This is Boki Dik observatory ! A very strong earthquake ... The mystery is here : something like a machine destroyed the observatory and demolished it entirely . Therefore , it is the saucer beast for sure . I have an idea . Kouji , fly to the place again . Yes , Sir . Saucer beast ( Gani Gani ) , camouflage yourself ! This is TFO . Visibility is zero as a result of a thick fog around the area of Boki Dik . Getting close is a dangerous risk , return immediately . I got that . Oh , Professor ! Professor , this is the publication of the aerial situation in the area of Mount Boki Dik . The weather must be good today . Something suspicious . Daisuke ! Didn 't Miuke come here ? She must be at the farm . On the contrary , she went somewhere else ! What ? Miuke ... Miuke ! Did you fine her ? No , I haven 't found her and she is not here . I figured that she may have returned to the mountain . Don 't be absurd , Daisuke . You know that she lost her memory . Yes , that is possible . It is possible that the chain of mountains and their expansion may remind Miuke of Boki Dik . That is possible . I will look for her there . Hey , Daisuke ! You must wait until dawn ! Daisuke is harmonious with the mountains . Mommy ! Daddy ! The girl lighted the candle . She was sitting under the wonderful Christmas tree . That was the last Christmas for her . She has done her Christmas tree and she made it better than any other one . Thousands of candles lights were shining on the green leafs ; and a lot of beautiful pictures that stores have on windows . Upon her powers the girl raised her hands to the pictures and said ... Where is my family ? And she starts crying and says ... Mommy ! My daughter , I love you so much ... Mamma ! Mamma ! Mamma , take me with you ! Mamma , please don 't leave me alone . This girl is an obstacle . Create an avalanche ! I have to go ; I have to go to see my mother and father ! Who are you ? Duke Fleed . Duke Fleed ? I came to help you . No , I will never be saved ! Be brave and depend on me . I understand now , Duke Fleed . Under the Christmas tree , I will be asked : what type of present do I want ? Alright , what do you think of an engagement with the Prince of Stars ? I must cross over the Rainbow Bridge and to sail in the galaxy . Please let me meet the Prince of Stars , even in the dreams . Be brave and depend on me . Look ! Behind the rocks and snow a beast is hiding ! Help Boki Dik please . Look ! This is part of her memory : the monster that attacked the observatory is that saucer beast . The beast was hiding itself under the snow and by using fog . There must be a secret hiding at Mount Boki Dik as Miuke said . I will see it immediately ! Let 's go . Alright ! Duke Fleed . Grendizer Go . It 's Grendizer ! What ? This is bad ! We need another day to complete our base . Alright , prepare Minifo to attack ! I will take care of them . Duke Fleed , go and get the saucer beast from the mountaintop ! Alright ! Okay Minifo , here I come . Ah , something suspicious in that hole ! Hand Beam . Commander , Grendizer returned to attack ! There is no time to use the missiles . Prepare the saucer beast ( Gani Gani ) ! Yes , Sir ! Oh , DAMN ! This is the freezing beam ! Grendizer Power Up ! Shoot In . Dizer Go . Screw Crusher Punch . Dizer Kick ! DAMN YOU ! And now is the chance to capture it , Duke Fleed . Shoulder Boomerang . Double Harken . Dizer Jump . Miuke , this is the Christmas tree , we made it for you . Get up now . No , no I can 't move . Look over there , it is Santa Clause . Jingle Bell , Jingle Bell , Merry Christmas Miuke . Hey Bunta , what you are doing ? Let it down , down ... It seems like it is stuck somewhere ... Again Bunta you have done that to me ! Merry Christmas Danbi . You are not happy at all , why is that ? Sorry , please forgive me ; I am very happy with you . Your eyes are so sad , maybe that because you can 't walk or something else ... Ah , what is that ? Merry Christmas . Hey , that 's wonderful ! I will make your wish come true , would you like to come with me ? My Wish ? Yes , come with me . Kouji , what he will do ? Let 's go now . That 's wonderful ! Look over there , the Prince of Stars ! Duke Fleed ! The Prince of Stars ... is Duke Fleed ! Come here to cross over the Rainbow Bridge ! But I am ... I can 't walk . Look ! You are able to stand ! Now be confident in yourself and try to walk ! Miuke , do your best ! Pull yourself entirely . Hope in life will be yours when you cross the bridge ! Miuke ! Do your best ! Stand up again . Stretch your legs firmly . Here , I stood ! Miuke , Mamma and Papa will watch your happy life from heaven . It is a favor from the Creator of the Heavens . Papa , Mamma ! I will try to cross over the bridge . I have passed the bridge . You have done good Miuke . I will do my best ! And now , let 's go to the dream land . Merry Christmas . UFO ! UFO !

The first time that I see my dad beat the rice cake . You kids , you don 't know how to beat the rice cake . I am coming . Show time . I will show you that I am still able to do it . Now you will see . Don 't overdo the beating , Father . Don 't exaggerate ! Quiet , Hikaru ! Don 't make me look stupid . Oh my back ... Wait ... Didn 't you hear me ? I told you not to beat it too much . I am alright , don 't worry . Now I will begin . Father , are you okay ? What is happening ? What happened to you old man ? What a shame ! How futile . Let me beat the rice cake . Now , Hikaru , will you help me ? Let us start . Hey , don 't raise the mallet with her ; you will be sorry , eh ? You are so good . You are good at beating the cake , Bunta . Because I am very harmonious with Hikaru . I FOUND YOU ! BUNTA ! Hide me ! Hide me , Hikaru ! Bunta ! Bunta , get away from Hikaru , you idiot ! Get away ! Bunta , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? You told me that you don 't like to beat the rice cake at home . But I like to beat it with Hikaru , Mother . Move Bunta . Go home and beat it there . Take him away ! Take him with you ! Take him , take Bunta away ! Take him ... What are you doing , Father ? He just left ! He left ! Go away , don 't come back . What ? He left ? What happened , Chibi ? The cattle and horses are agitated . What happened , huh ? What is happening ? Huh , what is that ? That is ... Something is about to explode ! Something startling over the horizon ! Father ... The saucer beast absorbs the solar rays with these two shields . It fires all this heat at once , after the heat has filled it with maximum power . It is using the solar power as a weapon , Father . Its aim may be accomplished . It will be Grendizer , I understand . I am preparing myself . Me too . Yes , the saucer beast never scares me . But I would like you to extinguish the fires , Kouji . Don 't you see that extinguishing the fire is important ? Okay , I understand . Duke Heed . Grendizer Go . Take care of the fires , Kouji . I am dissatisfied . Spin Saucer . It is possible to save some time to find Duke Fleed . He is coming by himself . You will die this time . You will be Giro Giro 's Victim . Melt Shower . The Melt Shower is not fulfilling its job . Okay ! Dizer Go . Let me help you ! Stop , Kouji . Don 't come near it ! Alright now it is my chance . Watch out ! Screw Crusher ... Doesn 't work ! Double Harken . The lever is not working ... Alright , The solar energy was the reason for damaging Grendizer 's weapons systems . Now , Giro Giro ! Attack him ! Destroy him into piece . Capture him ! Daisuke ! Are you okay ? Withdraw ! Withdraw now kouji . What do you want me to do ? Get away from it , Daisuke ! Do you hear me Daisuke ? It 's no use as long you can 't use the weapon systems ! Withdraw at the present time , or else you will be defeated ! Gather yourself , Daisuke ! Now is the chance Daisuke ! Dizer Jump . Spazer Cross . It is following you , Daisuke ! I will take care of it . Grendizer 's image disappeared from the radar . They should have used the artificial cloud which is able to cut the elective waves . Alright , let Giro Giro land. it isn 't possible to stock up on the solar power at night . Let 's wait until the break of dawn ! I am sorry . I went forward too much , so Grendizer 's weapon systems were damaged . Can we fix it tomorrow morning ? Yes . The saucer beast uses solar powers , and it may resume its animosity at sunrise , Father . Double Harken isn 't working . The saucer beast , what can it do ? We will get by the situation . Let me help him ... I catch you ! You lazy person , get back to the pasture as fast as possible . Danbi ! We are now very occupied in this institute . For that reason , Daisuke is helping the Professor , as you can see . So please , he will help you tomorrow . No ! The animals are scared and can 't sleep , and on top of all of this , a mare is about to deliver . At a time like this , we can 't do anything without Daisuke . I will take him in any way . What a stubborn man you are ! Daisuke have a bad luck always . I will go with you , Please , don 't pull me hard ! Come now ! They are scared of something , right ? Yes , that 's right. it is said that animals have an unusual ability of sensing danger . I am afraid of a pessimistic occurrence . No , Kouji . That is reckless , I will not allow it . Grendizer cannot use his weapons as you are aware . There won 't be a chance other than this night . We make our decision to eliminate the saucer beast after consultation with Daisuke . Grendizer was harmed because of me . I like to fix my mistakes on my own . Kouji ! Don 't worry , Danbi . She will deliver in the morning . I see , I see . I am very anxious for the coming of the colt . I will love him as much as I love spacemen . We will fix Grendizer as fast as possible . Alright , everything is in order . I will rip it apart with this powerful bomb . Will she deliver safely , Daisuke ? Don 't worry ; you will get a nice colt in the morning . That 's correct ! I am happy , very happy ! I will rip you apart . I did it . No ... I have to escape ! What ? You said that you will make Duke Fleed submit , Gandal ? Yes , Sir . Using the turnover plan by using the inimitable beam . After Giro Giro , everything will be burned and turned into ashes . This operation accomplishes two objectives And what we derives must be accomplished , which is annihilation and devastation ! You are very smart , Gandal . Thanks very much for your praise , Sir . Oh , it is your plan this time as well , Lady Gandal . Yes , Sir ! Blacki ! Yes , Madam ! Execute the turnover plan at the break of dawn . We are going to kill the accursed Duke Fleed today ! This time it will be Grendizer 's last day , we will surely eliminate him . I will make Giro Giro destroy him . Go now , Commander Blacki . Yes , Madam . Destroy them all as Lady Gandal said . He is truly beautiful . Listen to me , Hikaru . This colt will be the best horse in the future . What is happening now ? Finally , the saucer beast has appeared . ETO ETO , I am coming to see you spaceman , ETO , ETO ! Am I in a dream I wonder ? This is horrible , huh , what is that ? It is taking that path , horrible ! The winds are blowing toward us . The situation is dangerous ! Then I will tell everyone . The situation is dangerous ! What are we going to do , Daisuke , huh ? We have to conduct ourselves , eh ? And with wisdom . We have to find some ways to protect ourselves from that beast that is coming toward us . They want Grendizer . Kouji ! Wait , Kouji ! While I keep the saucer beast occupied , I hope you can go and fix Grendizer 's weapon systems . What if you get attacked with the solar beam ? You might be killed , Kouji . Understand what I say ! I know more than you ! I don 't care . Don 't be foolish ! You will not live twice . I will go . Leave this matter to me alone . Did you understand me ? Understand me well . Daisuke ... Daisuke , be careful of getting killed ! Daisuke , go there immediately . Let 's go , don 't be late ! I will pray for your success . Grendizer Go . They came now ... The know that the weapon systems doesn 't work . Alright then , I will launch Grendizer towards them ! Here I come . Dizer Go ! I will not let you come forward here , even if it 's one step ! It 's not possible for me to withstand his attacks after this , if I remain on this routine . Damn ! I will fix the weapon systems . Professor , is there a way to defeat it ? We have to act quickly , for the situation is dangerous ! There is one . What is it ? Burning its interior systems and this is by reflecting back the solar beam on it with the mirror . But I say that is impossible . I will install the mirror on the bottom of the TFO . If you are not able to destroy its interior systems , you will burn like coal ! I will not let Duke Fleed die before our very own eyes . I will not let Diauske die . Let me do this , please , please ! But ... We don 't have enough time ! The mirror has been prepared . Good luck ! Come out , saucer beast ! Open Mirror ! I succeeded ! The solar beam was destroyed . Great ! The repairs have been completed ! Double Harken . He did it ! Imp " - Impossible ! Oh Professor , welcome . A letter for you , Kouji A letter for me ? I am wondering who sent it ?

I see , okay I am coming . Special Prison Cell Number 13 : Commander Yara ! Leave now . How is life in your dark residence behind the moon ? A miserable life ! I believe that you like to live in the light and this is your last chance . I am a scholar . I did not study earthquakes to kill people and to destroy civilizations . Daredevilry ! Do you still say that ? Wait for a moment ! We completed establishing the earthquake device that you designed on Earth . We left out the last step of connecting the device and the power and we cannot do it without you ! We need you . I am not able to work on slaughtering people regardless of your requests from me . Is this talk that an ally of our says ? Take this ! Blacki , enough ! Oh Lady Gandal , obedience to your command . Commander Yara , come here . Your family your mother and you . Do you understand ? Yes ? Alright , but you may not know what that the Vegan Empire has recently modified all of its laws and that will cause you harm , eh ? Adjusting the law ? That 's right . The law states to exile the careless prisoners of war who disobey orders like you , to the Flaming Ghost planet with their families . Do you understand ? What ? The Flaming Ghost Planet ? The Flaming star used to be a beautiful planet , and was called the Blue Angel Planet and it used to be rich in natural resources . Great Vega 's ambitions were to possess space , and he ordered invading this planet first . The ones who lived there did not know how to resist the United Vegan Forces . The streets and nature were destroyed and all captives were sent to prisons to work in the metal resource mines . Steam and dust covered the sky and sea so the Blue Angel Planet after that was named the Flaming Ghost Planet . Until today , the criminals and the captives are still being sent to this planet . And this planet has become a dead flaming planet , just as its name implies . I am sure that you know the Flaming Ghost Planet . Nobody has returned from the Planet . And especially old ones like your mother , eh ? How can old ones like your mom withstand that planet ? You alone can save your mother from that hell ! Your mother 's life depends on your decision ... Oh my Mother ... What 's wrong Commander Yara ? Work according to our orders . Do you understand ? Oh my poor Mother ... it is said that you will not leave your mother to die , because you are loyal to her . And now , Commander Yara , what is your decision ? Commander Yara , do you want to kill your mother ? Speak , will you help us ? Good , get ready ! Drown a section of land in the depths of the sea . Commander Yara . Pilot the UFO beast Garo Garo , and go to the Earthquakes Station . Commander Blacki , the aim of this operation is to lure Grendizer and Duke Fleed , is that clear ? That 's right . Hey Goro look how wonderful the snow is ! Let 's go now ! Okay , here I come . That 's wonderful ! Outstanding ! Oh I am flying ! Try it , Bunta . I will try it there ! I hope I don 't fall . Oh someone help me please ! Father ! Shovel the snow down from the rooftop instead of this work . Bring it down ! Nonsense ! I have a humanitarian message to be in a good relationship with the spacemen . Bringing down the snow is trivial compared to my message . A spaceman ? I don 't know how to stop it ! Father ! Bunta , you criminal ! I am sorry , I beg your pardon ! I can 't accept your apologize ! How dare you fall on top of my telescope ? Huh ? Tell me ! Tell him Hikaru that he is ... He " ) me ! I will kill you ! Do you know how many earthquakes recently occurred ? I am going to find the source of the earthquake . To the Canto mountains . They are the source of the consecutive earthquakes that occurred recently . I see . Let 's go , TFO ! The boiling point is 03 X5 . The depth is 5,000 meters . Magnification of the earthquake is complete . The shore of Canto will down in the sea . Did he come ? Is it Grendizer ? Not him . A small flying object is annoying us . That 's right , perhaps we can make it as a bait ... ls the source of the earthquake here ? I know that , you are the cause of the earthquake ! Kouji , all the danger is in getting close to the UFO beast Don 't worry ! Missile launch ! Kouji , Kouji , don 't try ! I want to help him . Help him immediately . Duke Fleed . Grendizer Go ! Kouji , Kouji , are you alright ? Alright . Alright . Shoot In . Dizer Go ! Come , UFO beast ! Screw Crusher Punch . Wait , I have something to say to you Duke Fleed ! What do you want now ? Double Harken . Pay attention ! If you continue to resist , your friend will be killed ! Damn you ! Listen to me Duke Fleed , I am Commander Yara . Killing is against my nature . We prepared the earthquake device that will drown the area of Canto in the sea . However , I don 't want to kill people with knowledge to which I have devoted my life . Duke Fleed , will you give us the Grendizer ? If you give us Grendizer , I will destroy the earthquake switch immediately . We will make exchange . Are you asking me to depend on you ? That 's right . The fate of the people on Earth depends on your decision and also your friends ' life . It 's a trick Duke Fleed ! Don 't get fooled ! Kouji , how amazing the knowledge of Vega is , and how harsh he is . Why don 't you depend on me ? Don 't trust him ! Even if you submit it , the Earth will go to destruction ! Believe me Duke Fleed . I am a scholar . I hate war . My parents died in war . I don 't want to kill people with my knowledge . I will convince Lady Gandal even if I sacrificed my life . I am not fooling you . Believe me , Duke Fleed ! Alright Commander Yara , I believe you . Thank you for your trust Duke Fleed . You were at my good assumption . Commander Yara , release Kouji first . Don 't believe him , Duke Fleed ! It is a trap ! Let 's go. hurry ! Alright , go as you please . No Duke Fleed , why you 've done that ? Don 't believe him ! Leave the place immediately , Kouji ! Bu ... But ... Please ! Leave now Kouji . Alright I will leave . And now , prepare yourself Duke Fleed and go . Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! Damn ! Duke Fleed , wait for me . I will help you ! What ? You say that Duke Fleed was taken as a captive ? Yes , Sir ... Duke Fleed was taken captive with my special was and this is evidence of my cleverness , eh ? Oh Lady Gandal 's special ways ; that is outstanding ! You words honor me . What will you do with Duke Fleed ? We will put him in Magma Hell as a sacrifice tomorrow , when we drown the area of Canto in the sea . Excellent , I want to see Grendizer immediately . Yes , Sir . Pay attention , Commander Yara . Commander Blacki , we have taken Duke Fleed and Grendizer and we no longer need an earthquake . Our orders are to drown the area of Canto in the sea and letting the people know the might of the United Vegan Forces . Commander Blacki , I promised Duke Fleed that we will not drown the shore of Canto . Therefore , I hope you don 't drown it . Quiet ! That is an order . Put Duke Fleed in Magma Hell , understood ? Commander BLACKI ! Do you understand , Commander Yara ? Commander Yara ! Captain Bouchi , launch the Earthquakes Base and arrest Commander Yara . Yes , Sir . We can get close to Mount Asahi , but the difficulty is in bypassing Mount Tsurugi. if we go with TFO , the missiles will attack us ! That 's correct . What do we do then ? That 's it ! We use the skis . I want to talk to Duke Fleed . Open the door . You , wait outside . Duke Fleed . What happened , Commander Yara ? I am going to see General Gandal . This computer tape is for the Earthquake Amplifier , keep it with you please . Was your suggestion really refused ? But I will keep my promise . Without this tape , the device does not work . I leave it with you until I return . Duke Fleed , I thank you for your trust in me . Commander Yara . Open the door . Commander Yara ! Mother , you taught me that the principle is the life of the person . When I hear that they were going to send you to the Flaming Ghost Planet ... Because of my principle , I tried to ignore my principle . However , I found a great man on Earth , he trusted me , and he sacrificed himself for his promise to me . Therefore , I will keep my promise for him , even if I sacrifice my life ... You 're truly Yara to his mother . Commander Yara ! What ? You are under arrest . What ? There it is ! I 'd better hurry . All praise is to God , I miraculously made it ! Commander Yara , surely you know the reason for your arrest . We don 't need you after the Earthquake Amplifier has been completed . You are dangerous because of your resistance to us . There is no place for the likes of you with us ... What ? Hear this before we put you into the brainwashing machine : Commander Yara , your mother died after she was sent to the Flaming Ghost Planet . What ? My mother died ? ! Alright , now put him into the brainwashing machine . And now , you are strictly a fighting machine ! Go to the Earthquakes Base , and drown the shore of Canto as ordered ! Oh they have returned . I am going now . I will try , and leave everything in the hands of God . Here I come . Damn it ! Alright we will eliminate Duke Fleed immediately ! Take him to Magma Hell . Yes , Sir ! Oh , it is you Commander Yara ? ! Alright and now open the doors of Magma Hell ! Fulfill the sentence on Duke Fleed ! They have turned you into a fighting machine , isn 't that so ? Eliminate him immediately ! Oh . Kouji ! Duke Fleed , try to swing and fly ! Let 's hurry , from here ! He escaped ! Arrest them immediately ! Hurry ! Kouji , give me your hand ! Dizer Go ! Spin Saucer . Damn ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go . Hand Beam . Screw Crusher Punch . Alright , now it is my chance . Spin Saucer ! Double Harken ! What happened ? Nonsense ! Contact the Earthquakes Base and drown the shore of Canto ! Right away , Commander . Let 's fight UFO beast ! Oh , DAMN ! No ! The shore of Canto ... Look ! The shore of Canto is sinking in the sea ! Commander Blacki , the amplifier doesn 't work , so the shore of Canto will not sink . What happened ? Damn you Commander Yara ! I cannot kill ! Oh , Commander Yara . Commander Yara , thank you . Thank you for your trust in me , Duke Fleed . Farewell , Commander Yara . Hey ! What 's wrong , Daisuke ? Let 's return . Spazer Cross . UFO ! UFO ! Professor , an annoying disturbance ! What ? ! Strange . Do not ignore any abnormal sign . And by the way Mr. Hayashi . It is better that you go out to meet her in Tokyo . I am sure she is waiting you . Kouji , take Hayashi to the station right now , and I ask you to bring the delivered goods with you . Alright ! UFO Robe Grendizer ' . Episode Sixteen . Victory of Love . The one sitting in the car besides the TFO pilot must be a member of The Research Institute . She is amazing ; a very beautiful girl ! You are strange in nature with different sights , so beautiful . Is that true , Bunta ? Look at how pretty and amazing she is , Guru . Bunta ! It is better that you hurry , or you will be late for school ! That 's true ! Goro , let 's leave ! Hurry let 's go ! Oh , wait , wait ! Why she has done that to me ? Hey , wait for me you two ! Kaori ! Oh , Akira ! Ah , this is Mr. Kouji Kabuto ! Nice to meet you ! I am Kaori Shirakawa , nice to meet you . By the way she is so pretty . Kaori , we have to receive some goods . Would you go to Shirakaba Farm by bus ? Yes , for sure . Wouldn 't she come with us by car ? I think the delivered goods will fill the car . Oh , that 's right . We will follow you immediately . I understand , yes . I will make out of this girl a spy on The Research Center . This is the best chance to test out the new mind waves controlling device . From now on , you will obey my orders . Did the bus break down ? Hold yourself . What 's the story ? What happened ? A strange man suddenly hit me . Didn 't a young girl board the bus ? Where did she go ? Answer me ! I can 't breathe ! Something strange happened ! Kaori ! What happened to you ? The bus broke down ... My head hurts ... That 's terrible . Climb in , let 's go . Welcome ! Professor informed me that you are coming , and I was waiting for you , welcome . Nice to meet you . I thank you greatly , nice to meet you too . A beautiful white bird landed on a pile of trash . Isn 't that right , Daisuke ? I meant that Hayashi 's fiancé is very cute and beautiful . Shall we go in now ? Come in both of you . The matter puzzles me . Did something strange happen ? You know ? It seems like the bus was attacked by someone . The bus ? Yes , that is very strange . I want more details ! When I was in Texas , I was ... You were useless Father , yes . Correct , correct ... Pardon me ? What is this disgusting talk you say to your father ? Huh ? Good night . Wait Goro ... Good God , he is a brat ... a brat ... He is always on this state as you see . Even with that ... Alright , alright . It is late . There is no doubt that Kaori is tired . Sleeping is better . Come out immediately ... the control has changed ! That is Kaori for sure ... Kaori is in bed in a deep sleep now . Her long trip tired her out . Now she rested . Okay , go now . Good morning . Hey Kaori , good morning . You are better now . Because I slept well . Good morning . Good morning . Where did she go last night ? ! Oh , Kaori , your hair ornament is about to fall off . Oh , thank you . Akira ! Shall we go for a trip in the car now ? I prefer to see your place of work Akira , eh ? It is impossible that she is Kaori ... Look Akira , is Grendizer 's base nearby ? Pardon me ? ! Who informed you of this ? I heard now Mr. Kouji Kabuto talking about that . Unbelievable ... Kouji did not talk about Grendizer . I want to see other places . Sorry but you cannot . No , I see . Oh , Professor . I am sorry for making you both wait . I am Kaori Shirakawa . My name is Umon . I heard a lot about you from Mr. Hayashi . I hope you enjoy your stay here . Yes I will . May be you can also discuss your future . When I look at this gentle scene , it doesn 't seem like our battle with the Vegans is real . Yes , I agree with you . A man from other planet ! My friend you have come finally , my beloved ! He is really a man from outer space . Welcome to our Skirakaba Farm ! A long travel distance tired you out ... Oh what 's that ? That 's ... GORO ! Now you figured it out , Father ?

Come on ! Kaori was ... What ? No need to worry he will live . I see . What happened to Kaori , Professor ? I fear that this girl is being controlled by a spy . A spy ? Ka ... Kaori ... You are crying ? Everyone calls me an orphan ... and my toy . I am an orphan , too . But I never cry . If you cry , you will become more miserable . Cheer up . Take this . Akira , promise me that you will be my friend . Yes . Do you promise me ? Yes , I promise you ! Hayashi and Kaori are both orphans . Because of this they love each other so much . It 's real loss that something like this has happened . Won 't Kaori return to her normal state ? That hair ornament bothers me ... Daisuke ! Let 's go and look for Kaori ! Alright . What dirty trick is the man from Planet Vega playing ? Hey , KAORI ! Where are you ? ! Listen ! I want additional information about the Research Center . Take the Professor hostage . Go now ! Stay where you are ! Ka .. Kaoir ! Huh ? Kouji , no ! Professor will die if you move . DAMN ! Father ! If you come close I will shoot the Professor ! Snatch the hair ornament off her head quickly ! Let 's go Kouji ! Hair ornament ? ! It is a direct mind wave control device . Alright ! Don 't come near ! Kaori ... Shoot me first ! He is trying to make himself a target for her . Watch out , Hayashi ! Hayashi , don 't come close ! Please don 't come close ... Kill him , shoot him now ! Kill them ! Do it now . Kaori , it 's me . Do you see ? Both of them look amazing . We can get marry when the fight with Vegan Army stops . That 's right . But when ? ! When peace will happen ? Akira ... Kaori ! It failed , it failed ! Then I will kill them all with the saucer beast Horo Horo ! It is the saucer beast ! It is here . I will crash it immediately ! Daisuke , follow him ! Okay . Let 's go ! That is a missile !

Kaori , with her great love , defeated the direct mind waves controlling device . And Hayashi 's bravery defeated the enemy 's plan . It is a victory for love . Love ? Love was stronger than death . Good bye everyone . Good bye ... UFO ! UFO ! UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Seventeen . Saving a Small Life . Blacki , a hellish idea ! What is it General Gandal ? We need an advanced base to lock onto Duke Fleed 's base . According to our analysis , it is the point 22 . This is the farm . If we are able to destroy this mountain , and bury the nearby valley ... The area will be leveled , and we would establish a huge base . We have to start immediately ! And with that , finding Grendizer 's base will be easier . Blacki . Yes ! You mobilize anxiously for the attack , eh ? Yes ! Now that is enough , eh ? Daisuke ! Look at Sandy ; he is fawning to his mother . Sandy has become big , isn 't that so ? Hurry and see . Look at how smart he is ! Look ! The feeling of family is beautiful . I feel tied up with the presence of my father . On the occasion , I haven 't trained my horses for a long time . Really , Daisuke ? What do you think of us taking them out tomorrow , hmm ? So that I am able to accompany you in the trip . Woe to you , Hikaru ! You are talking with Daisuke ? Woe to you , I will go and inform my father . The moon has been overcome with the red color ! Oh , that is great ! It is the rosy moon . This is a bad sign . Pardon ? What did you say Daisuke ? We will not take the horses out tomorrow . We will postpone the date , Hikaru . Why do we postpone ? Daisuke , you promised , isn 't that so ? There is a deterrent , Hikaru . Oh , I thought I was going out for the trip far away from my Father 's supervision , but my assumption failed . I am sorry , Hikaru . I have a reason for the apology . Say what is it ? Alright , uh ... it is , umm ... You don 't want to walk with me , I knew it ! I want that , Hikaru . Don 't interpret it that way , please . I will not allow Hikaru to go out with Daisuke by herself ! Father , don 't stimulate your nerves , calm down please . There she is . The matter looks funny ... That 's right . What 's the story , Hikaru ? Won 't you go out to train the horses with Daisuke ? Daisuke cancelled the training . He doesn 't commit to his promise and this is not the habit of men . Oh , sorry for hearing that . I wasn 't intending on allowing him to take you with him . But I changed my mind . Leave me alone now . I apologize for being late . Daisuke ! You have to keep your promise . Take the horse for training tomorrow . Do you understand , Daisuke ? Hmm ? Understand ! Alright then . If you disobey the orders , I will pound your neck , a pounding , a pounding ! Please pardon . Commander Blacki . It appears that a snow storm will blow over Japan according to our estimation . A snow storm ? We are lucky . It will hide our movements from them . Blacki . Yes , Sir . Even with luck , don 't be wasteful in optimism , understand ? Yes , Sir . Professor , I am noticing something important . The conditions are getting worse . We have to depend on our sensors , so that we don 't fall into error . I hope that Daisuke cancels taking out the horses for their training in this snowy weather . Professor I hope so , but Danbi is stubborn and he will not amend his determination and that is his nature . I don 't want the horses to be exposed to the storms , and we must stick to the side of caution . Perhaps you are asking : Why bring them out in this snowy weather ? I want you to think of the horses in Hokayado . Does the snow harm the horses ? Look at them ! They look anxiously to get out . Today is the day of the meeting between the human and animal to go out for training . NOW , let 's begin ! Good Bye . Take care . Good bye . Now , all the horses GO ! Later ! Take care ! Let 's go . Move now ! Run now , move ! I want to make sure that Hikaru doesn 't get close to him . Daisuke ! Don 't get close to Hikaru ! Leave her alone , Daisuke . DON 'T GET TOO CLOSE TO HER , EH ? ! Now I am coming to be there ! Let 's move ! Daisuke , it is time ; the situation is dangerous . Should I go for observation ? Before that , we have to do something with these horses . They are our responsibility in the farm , Kouji . Danbi is very stubborn . Daisuke , the weather is forewarning a fierce snow storm ! The snow storm is coming very fast ! This is correct ; the condition will worsen . Let 's go . UFO beast Giba Giba , hurry to the specified location for you during the snow storm ! Professor , the radar is showing an unknown object . Where it is now ? From the Blue Zone one to Yellow Zone five . If it advances in a straight line it will be here . Isn 't it the flying saucer from Vega army ? Th ... This terrible , terrible ! Kouji , it is better that we return now ! Okay ! Hikaru ! Goro ! Hold yourself together ! Return the horses ! Return the horses right now ! Okay ! Return them now , don 't go farther ! We cannot train them in this weather ! Let 's Go ! Let 's go back ! Let 's go back ! Let us return to the farm now ! Kouji , watch the back . OKAY ! Oh , what is that ? Kouji , it is the UFO beast . Go with the horses , hurry ! Hikaru ! Goro ! Escape now ! Sandy , hurry up and escape ! All of you hurry up and escape ! Daisuke , I am going to collect the horses ! Kouji , WAIT ! Daisuke ! Escape ... I am alright now . Go with the horses quickly , COME ON MOVE ! HURRY ! Okay . Hey Sandy ! Hurry and escape ! HURRY ! Hey , Sandy ! Where are you going ? SANDY ! Sandy ! Sandy ! Huh ? That is Kouji . I wonder what happened to him ? He seems very disturbed . I hope that nothing happened . I feel that harm has afflicted him . Let 's go ! Hey Kouji , wait ! Wait ! What happened ? Why do you seem disturbed ? What happened ? Tell me , Kouji ! The UFO beast attacked us . What did you say ? Get out of my way ! Wait , wait , wa ... I have to do something . Let me do something ! That is a ... Hey I have heard that you need help old man ! Oh , Bunta you came to help ! What do you want me to do ? Tell me ! Bunta ! You are the man that I want ! The Saucer beast attacked us ! What do you say ? Something is exploding on the other side of the farm ! That is correct . They were attacked by the saucer beast . Okay , I am going there now ! Bunta I am coming also . I will not forgive myself if anyone is touched by harm . Huh ? I will help them now ! Oh , what is that ? Thank you , but hurry now ! And I will go on now ! Alright , Missiles launch ! Damn ! Why does the saucer beast come to such a valley to harm the people ? Giba Giba , do not concern yourself with such a small occurrence . Destroy the rock and level the ground so that we can establish our base . The Minifo is ready . Launch it immediately . Protect Giba Giba , launch it ! It appeared again . Oh ! The UFO saucer is landing in the valley again . Missile , launch ! Return quickly ! Let 's go ! Don 't worry I am here ! I am here to save you ! Are you alright , Hikaru ? Hurry and go back . Come on hurry now . Hurry , hurry ! Ah ! Where is Goro ? Sandy isn 't here either ! Hikaru where are Sandy and Goro ? I will look for them . He was here before a little while . Huh ? I will go to look for Goro now , let 's go ! Hey , Sandy . Don 't go so far . Sandy , don 't take that direction ! Sandy , Wait , please wait ! Sandy ... Sandy ... Stop where you are , Sandy ! Don 't take that direction ! Sandy ... Sandy ... Sandy , I love you , come back ! How Happy I am to meet you ! Thanks God you are saved . Sandy , don 't tire me ; I love you , Sandy , Sandy ...

My son is present here , huh ? Don 't be harshly help me . Why don 't you talk ? I am your friend . The matter will be terrible . I must attack the UFO beast quickly . Let 's go ! Duke Fleed ! Grendizer Go ! Take this ! Melt Shower ! Daisuke ! Kouji , leave the place to me . Save Goro ; he went to the mountain after Sandy . Daisuke , don 't worry . I can eliminate them by myself . I will help Goro now . Kouji , hurry ! I will exile the UFO beast from the area . Okay , Daisuke I got that , I will leave this place for you . Hey . Goro ! Where are you , Goro ? Hey , did I climb to this level ? GORO ! Huh ? That is Danbi ! Hey , Kouji ! Search for Goro , look for him ! Okay ! Oh , that is Sandy ! Hey , Sandy ! Wait ! Alright ! Here I go . Sandy ... Sandy !

I will see you later . Thank you , Kouji ! Be careful ! Be careful ! He is truly a man he can 't be compared with Daisuke . Greetings , kouji . Ah , Daisuke ! Thank you for your efforts . Everyone is safe . I am very happy with the saving of Goro and Sandy , and with our saving the city . Allowing them to establish their base may put our entire area in danger . Correct . We have beaten the aggressors with a big defeat . UFO ! UFO ! UFO Robe Grendizer ' . Episode Eighteen . The Launching of The Secret Route Number ' l . The intention of this route is to launch Grendizer without the spacemen noticing . Each one of you will have an additional roll over and above the regular space study .

Now , return to your positions and complete your work . Better your work , Daisuke . Alright ! This is really tiring . Perhaps I am not young anymore to climb . What is happening ? Look at that ! Ah , it is a UFO , I am sure ! What ? The UFO is in the forest ? I will be there immediately ! Where did it go ? Over there . Dangerous road . Alright , let 's exit from the car here . Hurry , we have to do something ! Don 't do it ... Oh , it is a UFO ! It is coming this way . It is a reconnaissance flight . It is so . I will repel them far away . Don 't be hasty , Kouji ! This is Daisuke speaking . Kouji went to meet the UFO . Tell him not to be harsh . I got that , Father . Don 't stand in my way ! A group of UFO 's is coming ! Don 't go until I receive an order from the Professor . You mean that I observe them ? You will fall in their trap if you attack them with recklessness this way . I understand what you mean . I am back ! Welcome back . It arrived ! UFO arrived ! It is better that you hide . They are dangerous . Hikaru , Goro ! But , wait let me look ... Hey ! Hello my friends , I am Danbi , welcome . UFO come on . Uncle , come down from the tower , please ! Four-colored flag , what are you doing ? Come down and hide ! Shut up ! Saucer man , I want to be a friend of the spacemen . Hey come on , my friends come on ! Yahoo ! They were able to hear my space language . How awesome is that . Come on , come on ! Come down ! My dear UFO ! I can 't stand anymore ! Father , Father ... It is a good thing that he falls on Bunta . Bunta was a cushion for you a number of times , isn 't that so ? I am happy to hear that . What is that ? Oh , it is Kouji ! Stop ! Missile , launch ! I will not let them go . Strange , they must be close by ; I will go and look . Did any UFO land close by ? The place has to be nearby . What the hell you are doing ? ! What happened to the people of this city ? Policeman ! Policeman ! This is agent three , agent three . We have arrested , Kabuto Kouji . Good . Give him an injection and wait until Duke Fleed comes . He will come to help Kouji without fail . I got that . Answer me ! Kouji , answer me ! Kouji ! Professor no response has gotten to me from him over the village of Kisuzaki . Daisuke . Are you able to go and search for him ? No , I told him not to go . Let him sleep in the bed that he has built , Father . Did you understand me ? That is correct , but ... No , I won 't go ! You are our human machine . How stupid you are Kouji ! Kouji , answer me ... Kouji , answer , it is me Umon ! Answer me now , Kouji ! Kouji ... Kouji ! Answer please ... Kouji , I am Umon ...

Arrow Gun ! Missile , launch ! Duke Buggy Jump ! Buggy Missile GO ! Daisuke ! I will crush you ! How miserable this flying saucer beast is ! That will be enough . Kouji will be affected later . What ? Did you give Kouji a Vegan injection , and then returned him to Duke Fleed ? That 's right ; his work depends on our instructions . This is also my plan . Soon , we will know from Kabuto Kouji the place of Grendizer 's launch base . The fate of Duke Fleed and Grendizer is hung by a thread now . If we are able to bring him down , this World will be ours . I wish that you will succeed . Yes , Sir ! Blacki ! Start with the plan . We begin with the invasion strategy right away . Saucer beast Gali Gali , cast the Vegan magnetic wave to spread the germs . I am sorry for causing you worries Professor . I am happy to see that you are well . I feel a headache , pardon me . That is strange thing happened to Kouji . He is tired . By the way Father , you must be tired . I will conduct your work , please go to sleep . No , I am strong like you ! Oh , what a joke is that ? There are signals and information 's from Kouji ! And it is so . Let the saucer beast know the place . And now , we resort to raids , don 't worry . Good night . Good night to you too . What is it , Daisuke ? Someone is sending signals from this building . What ? ! Kouji ? What are you doing ? You stupid ! He is trying to guide them to this place ! Alright ! This is strange , the communication device is moving . What ? Don 't worry . A raid on an area of 4 kilometers squared will defeat Grendizer in any case ! What is the meaning of that ? Perhaps he was given a Vegan injection . A Vegan injection ? Yes . If a man is given a Vegan injection , he will be put in a state of hypnosis . And when the magnetic waves get to him , he does whatever instructions he was given before . How horrible that is ! Ah , Skirakaba Ranch is in danger ! What are you going to do with Kouji ? There is no plan at hand ! What you are doing ? Father , what is wrong with you ? Remain calm . Huh ? How do I remain calm ? I caught a cold ! You are like a child . Wear this now . Please , anyone help us ! Climb into the car all of you ! Let 's go ! My house burned ! All the money that I saved is lost now . Come quickly now and forget the money . Please remain here . That is safer , understood ? I don 't know what angered my friends . Father , I am going out to engage in the battle . Wait , if you go out now , they will know our place . Alright , what do you think of using a secret route , Saeki ? Route 6 . Yes , Sir . Route 6 is down . Route 4 . Route 4 ! Route 4 is damaged also . If we leave them now , they will ruin this area .

Duke Fleed . Grendizer : Standby , OKAY ! I hear you . Start moving , Grendizer . Grendizer is moving . I have finished descending the way . I am able to standby to move towards Route Number 7 now . The key to Route Number 7 is in orbit . Grendizer Go ! Soon Grendizer will reach Gotaki Falls . Grendizer has come . To all saucers beasts of Gali Gali . I have found Grendizer 's base . Begin raiding the way , immediately ! Melt Shower ! Spin Drill ! Spin Saucer ! You are still alive ? That is a magnetic communication device . Alright . Spin Drill ! Alright . Shoot In ! Dizer Go !

I have to crush it ! Space Thunder ! Kouji ... Anti-G gravity Storm ! Space Thunder ! Forgive me , Daisuke . I am shy because I had an ugly experiment like this , because I did not follow your orders . I know his nature , for he is like my son . Are you able to forgive him , Daisuke ? The pasture of Shirakaba and the pasture of Arnbo were destroyed . You have to work as a carpenter to fix your mistakes . Yes , but I was affected by Vega a lot . The red blood cells eat it if it doesn 't receive magnetic waves for an hour . Really ? I will hit that Daisuke when he returns . Daisuke ! You are late ! What were you doing ? Am I able to help you ? Thanks , Kouji . Shame on you , Daisuke . SHAME ! What boy are you ? You are still under the effect of the Vega , huh ? Oh , that is my nature . Settle down ! Daisuke !

I think that Vegan is doing this . It is surely a meteor . Fortunately , it was destroyed in the mountain where no human casualties were caused . However , I would like to investigate just in case . Some of it is still exploding here and there . You must not move until everything settles down . I would like to investigate immediately ; would you bring some samples ? Yes . Dizer Punch ! Freeze beam ! Alright , you did a good job . Now , melt the land with the laser beam and establish a Minifo base there . Be careful so that the inhabitants of Earth don 't find you . If we can attack all the Earth from this base , we will possess the entire area of Japan within a minute ! Grendizer is one he cannot do anything . Duke Fleed , you will see the last day of Earth , after you watch the last day of Planet Fleed . All of space will belong to Planet Vega ! Makichi lost his homeland . And I lost my Planet Fleed .

I must do something to stop Minifo , while Grendizer is able to arrive . I will monitor the place while you come . Kouji , be careful ! Alright . Daisuke you can come right away if you are concerned about me . I see the aggressors from the top of this mountain . Alright , here I come to destroy all of you now .

I will return to be with you . I will be waiting for you Makichi . The village will return to what it used to be. it will return . Your village did not disappear . You have a place to rebuild . My homeland ... Earth is my second homeland ... UFO ! UFO ! The Earth is 380,000 kilometres distant from the moon . Despite that , it is always affected by the gravity of the moon . So the tide in the ocean , for example , which changes every day is established based on the moon 's pull , which is 380,000 kilometers distant from the Earth . UFO Robe Grendizer ' . Episode Twenty . The Escape ( rem the Snow-Covered Mountain . The soldiers of Vega have an advanced base on the surface of the moon ... And they benefit from the moon 's gravity . They are about to begin training on the plan to invade the Earth . Leader Vega ! These gravity controlling devices have the ability to turn on 1,500 flag ships . And we plan on installing twenty four units . All of them are subservient to the gravity control device , whether on the moon or on Earth . Then we move the moon to approach the Earth and this way , the Earth will be affected by the moon 's gravity , and we will surely be able to annihilate it . And will you succeed ? Are you sure of it ? No way to fail . Definitely ! Tomorrow morning at 8 : 2 5 , when the sun , the moon and the E earth are on one line we prepare the gravity control device , with a rate that is negative on the moon , and positive on the Earth . And it becomes possible to push the moon 50,000 kilometers in the direction of the Earth with the help of the gravity from the sun and the Earth . A hellish idea ! And so , they gravity control devices on Japan will be affected where we put them . And it will be hit by the tides , the earthquakes and the storms ! And even Duke Heed can on " ; face our forces . After that , no one can defeat us , because they will be busy ! Alright ! What is the extent of the work that was accomplished on Earth thus far ? Don 't worry . According to Blacki 's message to us , the work will be completed in 15 hours . Alright , I will await the good news . Yes , Sir ! This plan requires great effort and a long time . Now , we have completed transporting all the materials . We will await only the preparation of the location . Let the Mother Ship await the orders that are coming from space on top of Kirifoki . Yes , Sir ! What is that ? It is the UFO ! And the day of the total lunar eclipse arrived . In Mount Kirifoki ? Hey , Daisuke ! Now , we decide according to the game cards . What will we be deciding according to these cards ? Hey , we will decide who will remove the snow from the road . Today is your turn , Danbi ; don 't try to escape . Don 't be harsh . Now one game , huh ? Let 's start , take one ! No , you cheat . Give me the cards . Okay take it . Alright , give me . Ha ! And now , Danbi . When I was in the West long ago , they used to call me the game beast and nobody was able to beat me . Another boast . I look forward to see the day of his defeat at the hand of Daisuke . Come on , come on , Danbi , you must win ! I haven 't lost my skill yet . Ah , Daisuke , why don 't you display your cards ? Daisuke you are sure that this is your game ? Uncle , there is what is more important than playing . Daisuke , you are escaping because you don 't play well . Leave playing now and look at what they are threatening of dangers . Forget playing cards now ! It is not important ! Look at what is in this newspaper . Look at this picture , look ! Splendid ! Splendid ! Four aces ! And Father has four kings . You win ! Fine , as the saying goes , the mistake is a habit , Daisuke . Daisuke , terrific ! Splendid , Daisuke ! But , Daisuke wasn 't able to do such tricks . Really ? ! Daisuke ! What is wrong ? Father , I am sure that the UFO that appeared at Mount Kirifoki is the Mother Ship . I was thinking of the same thing , but maybe it is a coincidence . But , tonight at 7 : 25 , a complete lunar eclipse will occur . Mount Kirifoki is the best location . Mount Kirifoki ? At the time of the total lunar eclipse , the moon will be on top of Mount Kirifoki . I feel that there is something stored in this matter . Perhaps ... I wonder , will they transport the moon ? What ? Transport the moon ? Is that matter possible ? Father ! With what they have of applied sciences , this is possible ! In any case , Kouji is on his way to Mountain Kirifoki so we have to wait for his report before we reach any conclusion . Commander Blacki , installation of the last device has been completed . Everything is ready . We must wait the precise time for the occurrence of the complete lunar eclipse . Alright , now let all working saucers return . Yes . This is the control center . This is the control center . All working saucers must return to the Mother Ship . This is Mount Kirifoki . Huh ? Commander Blacki , there is a flying object that is approaching Mount Kirifoki ! What ? There is the flying saucer ! Let our saucers stop their withdrawal ! We were late , we can 't do that now ! DAMN ! UFO ! The UFO flew to some place around here ! There is a secret tunnel here ! Kouji ! Professor ! I saw a group of UFO 's flying from Mount Kirifoki . I am sure that they are building something underground in the mountain . I am sure of that . Kouji , investigate with more detail . Did you hear ? Yes , I got that ! Daisuke ! It is a scary matter , but what you said became a reality ! Would you go to Mount Kirifoki right away ? Alright ! Destroy him ! We must not allow him to destroy our big plan ! Duke Fleed ! Grendizer GO ! There are 24 units . I wonder what they are ? There it is , Vegan Soldiers ! Missile Launch ! Alright now , if you want to come , I am ready ! A wolf at the front door and a tiger at the back door , welcome the Vegan forces ! I did it ! This is Kabuto Kouji . This is Kabuto Kouji ! What is that ? Father ! Is that correct ? A gravity control unit with a high ability ! A gravity control unit ? Yes . Their plan is linked with transporting the moon towards the Earth by using this device . I understood , Daisuke . Then Kouji now is in danger . In all cases , you must hurry to Mount Kirifoki ! Alright , I got that ! Grendizer Full Power ! Full Speed Mach 9 ! Missile ... launch . Now that is the fourth one ! DAMN ! Damn ! Daisuke ! Space Thunder ! If we stay like this , Duke Fleed will destroy everything . Now , spilt the soldiers into two fronts according to schedule ! We won 't allow you to pollute this Earth ! it is impossible to pass through this narrow tunnel . Daisuke ! Daisuke ! What is it , Kouji ? They will attack you from the rear ! Be careful , Kouji !

Hey , Duke Fleed ! Wait ! If you throw the Harken now , Kabuto Kouji will not live ! What ? Duke Fleed , look to the rear ! Kouji ! Daisuke ... Don 't worry about me . You must save the Earth . If you want peace on Earth , throw your harken ! Dasiuke if my life was able to save the Earth , I will sacrifice with it ! Daisuke , save the Earth ! You are the only one who is able to save the Earth ! Throw the Harken ! Don 't worry about me . Kouji ... Now , Duke Fleed , are you going to throw your Harken ? Daisuke , throw it ! If you want to be the man of the Earth , you must throw your Harken now ! Don 't worry about me , please ... Duke Fleed ... You cannot throw the Harken ! If you throw your Harken , Kouji will become a piece of rubbish ! Duke Fleed ! Duke Fleed , looks like I am winning . Daisuke ! Why ? Why did you abandon the Earth ? Aren 't you a man that loves the Earth ? Why didn 't you throw the Harken ? WHY ? ! WHY ? ! Professor ... Will they do it ? The time hasn 't come yet to abandon it at any time ! We will persist until the true end arrives ! What ? Did Duke Fleed give up ? Yes ! The Earth is about to be in the grip of the soldiers of Vega ! Alright , you did well , Blacki . General Gandal , I think that there is no need to continue with the gravity plan . Blacki ! You must continue with the decided plan . We must make the inhabitants of Earth realize our true strength . Yes , Madam ! How will we deal with them ? After they see the Earth , which they tried to protect completely destroyed , then kill them ! Yes , Madam ! Blacki ! I am burning to see them , as they have fallen destroyed ! Yes , Madam ! Duke Fleed , Kabuto Kouji ! The end of both your lives has arrived ! Daisuke , why did you give up on saving the Earth ? No , I have not abandoned the Earth , ever ! But ... Duke Fleed and Kabuto Kouji , are you going to leave any last requests ? Blacki , it is still premature to think that you won . Now the game begins ! Don 't try to boast now ! Tie them ! Yes , Sir ! Kouji , look for a safe place ! Grendizer Go ! You brat ! Space Thunder ! Space Thunder ! Dizer Go ! Screw Crusher Punch ! DAMN ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! Space Thunder ! Space Thunder ! We need another 10 minutes ! The Future of Earth depends on these ten minutes ! Doesn 't work ! SPACE THUNDER ! I succeeded !

I beg your pardon , spacewoman . We can 't talk about your funny mood . Taro is about to die ! Really ? I am coming ... Kouji ! Oh , we won 't waste time ! General Gandal . Our device is now in the same orbit as the Earth 's space satellites . Good for now . Now , everything is in order . Blacki ! The temperature reflecting device has entered the Earth 's orbit . The rest depends on you . Yes , Sir ! I will defeat him for sure this time . I look forward to good news . Yes , Sir ! I see . Just as I expected . Taro has chest flu . Chest flu ? If we leave him like this , he will die . The veterinarian is too far . We have to give him a penicillin shot , eh ? Uncle , I will go to the city to bring the injection . Thanks , Daisuke ! Uncle , take care of Taro until I return . Depend on me . We will take care of him , Daisuke . Daisuke treats Taro like he treats his younger brother . Don 't you understand yet that your mother has no presence here now ? Drink , you are a spoiled baby . You are a spoiled baby . Perhaps Daisuke understands Taro 's lonesome situation . Don 't die , Taro . Keep your spirits high . This is a shortcut to the city . Alright ! Now our device is at the North Pole according to schedule . Alright , begin " Tsunami " plan now ! Now , stop the device where is it and turn it on . Yes , Sir ! Alright ! First , destroy the radar base of the United Nations . We will not let them disturb our plan . Yes .

Yes ! Taro , I will give you the injection . Keep your spirits high Taro . Don 't die . Why Daisuke is is late like this ? What is he doing now ? If he was a Shinobi he will ... Father ! Taro will die ; won 't you do something for him ? Goro , don 't repeat that talk ! You repeated it five times . SIX TIMES ! Not FIVE ! Oh ... six times ? One , Two , Three , Four , Five ... Shut up ! FOOL ! This is something unimportant ... no ... I have to do something before Daisuke 's return . Daisuke , where are you ? Taro , keep your spirits high . That 's an avalanche ! Damn ! What do I do ? The penicillin ! DAMN ! What I should do ? Taro will die without the penicillin ! I will return to the city ! Daisuke ... Daisuke ... What happened , Father ? Huh ? The radar base of the United Nations in the North Pole was destroyed by an enemy . The details are not available yet . But as a precaution , I asked Kouji to fly to the North Pole . If this was the work of Vegan soldiers , TFO will not be able to withstand them ! Daisuke ! TFO will not stand for too long . Father ... Father , give me one hour , Taro is sick and he is on the verge of death ! If you just gave me one hour , I can return to the city and bring the penicillin !

What is this that is happening ? Kouji flew on TFO , and ... Daisuke went ... Taro , keep your spirits high ! This is cruel on Taro . Dasiuke , that 's unfair . Your deed is not fair . Don 't cry , Hikaru . The first thing we do is give him a glucose injection . We have to keep Taro alive until Daisuke 's return . I got that ! Don 't get upset with me . In any case , Daisuke will receive his punishment when he returns ... Daisuke I will kill you ! Duke Fleed ! Grendizer Go ! Daisuke , forgive me . Taro , don 't die , keep your spirits high until I return . The issue of melting the ice from the North Pole is a matter of time only . Complete our plan until we defeat Grendizer . Yes , Sir ! Turn on the device ! Switch set on ! Huh ? What happened ? That 's funny ... lam really at the North Pole but I don 't see a piece of ice . Professor ! Professor ! What happened , Kouji ? I am at the North Pole . But I am seeing strange scenes . Take a look ! Professor , take a look . No trace of the ice field ; it disappeared . And this has to be an artificial occurrence . Kouji ! Perform a more detailed investigation . Yes . Professor ! Someone is melting the ice , with a mysterious beam ! What ? ! I will search for the one emitting the beam . Okay , but be careful and hurry , Kouji . This is the work of the Vegan soldiers again just as I thought . You are here again . Minifo , attack ! ATTACK ! I am here , Vegan soldiers ! Missile , launch ! Daisuke ! Kouji is in combat with the Vegan soldiers . Please hurry ! Kouji is in danger ! Alright , I got that ! Grendizer Power Up ! The speed now is the maximum . Mach 9 . Ah ... What is that ? It is a UFO ! A formidable UFO ! What speed ! Missile , launch ! Blacki will send you to hell . I deserve your praise ! You are here , UFO beast . You played enough . Here I come . Kouji ! Leave the rest to Grendizer ! I cannot return ! Let 's fight saucer beast ! DAMN ! Your end has come . Wait ... Blacki ! Take it , Duke Fleed ! Blacki , I will be your opponent . Duke Fleed ! Look at this carefully . I know that you intend to cause a big flood that will overflow the Earth . Your assumption is right . Now , Duke Fleed , if you don 't want this to happen , surrender immediately ! If we melt all the ice in the North Pole , the water level will rise 10 meters in the Northern Hemisphere ! Destruction to the trespassers ! I will not allow you ! This device is for melting the ice . Screw Crusher Punch ! Spin Saucer ! Space Thunder ! Space Thunder ! Huh ? This is the heart of my shot ! Oh , DAMN ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Daisuke , are you alright ? Father ... The water level has risen one meter until now . Daisuke , nevertheless , we have to stop them . Duke Fleed , surrender . If you 're fighting continues , we will continue with our plan and the Earth will have more dangers . Blacki ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Dizer Jump ! Space Thunder ! Damn it ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! Spazer Go ! Spin Saucer ! Space Thunder ! Screw Crusher Punch ! OH , DAMN ! Duke Fleed , I will return this debt to you ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross . Shoot Out ! Space Thunder . Ah ... I wonder what happened ? Kouji , are you alright ? Daisuke , what happened to them ? What happened to the Vegan soldiers ? We stormed them . I will go now , Kouji . Wait , Daisuke ! Grendizer Full Power ! Taro , I will come to you right away , keep your spirits high , be strong . Taro , don 't die ! Taro , keep your spirits higher ! You brought the Penicillin ? No , an avalanche blocked the way ... Oh , no ! Taro can 't wait any longer ! GORO ! I brought the medicine . Give Taro the Penicillin . I won 't let Taro die no matter what . Daisuke , Daisuke ! Are you alright ? Danbi , in any case , we should give him this Penicillin . Alright . Leave the rest to me . Goro , hurry ! Yes . Taro ... lam delighted that Taro is better now . I was about to give up . Danbi , I am truly delighted . However , where was Daisuke when Taro was in danger , eh ? I will punish him so hard ! I will punish him ... Don 't get upset , Uncle ; there is a reason for that . What reason is that , eh ? I can 't forgive him ... if the North Pole exploded , he would surely know the reason . UFO ! UFO ! UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Twenty Two . The Courage of a Flower . And finally , the point 13 is getting really affected from the magnet that disturbs our communications . We have found that the Chibana institute on Earth is developing a magnetic focusing device . For magnetic focusing ? If this device is completed , then our plans will be greatly disturbed ! Our leader Vega , what do you think of stealing that device and using it , huh ? Good idea . And now Gandal , begin your plan immediately . Yes , Sir ! She is talking too much . What is it , Gandal ? Nothing , Sir . I will send Commander Blacki right away . Do understand , Commander Blacki ? Yes , Sir ! Now , don 't you dare fail this time . Leave it to us , Sir . We will steal it . Commander Blacki , we will steal the device , do you understand ? Alright , I got that . This is the magnetic focusing device . By using it , we are able to repel all the space magnitude . Like this one . We are able to spread a magnetic net . This is great . We can cover the space with this , and it will protect us from the Vegan invasion . Professor , do you allow for its completion as fast as possible ? There are more than one or two problems . I would like to speak with Professor Umon to check it . Therefore , please give me some time . It is a beautiful music . What is this music ? It is a tune from a faraway land . Where is this far away land ? Wait for a moment ! Ladies and gentlemen in the Shirakaba White Maiden Farm . It is an awesome scene ! Oh , shut up ! Daisuke is playing a nice musical piece right now . Go on , scram ! Hey , the guitar is nothing . I am a man of third level Karate . Hey Daisuke , how about a one-o n-one fight ? Like cowboys ! Let 's begin our fight now ! What do you think , Hikaru ? The man has to be like me ! What do you think ? DAISUKE ! What is it , Daisuke ? Can 't you fight me ? You are afraid of me ? ! Not on his life ! Daisuke , hit him let 's go ! Hit him ! Hurry and punish him . You , you must teach him a lesson ! Yes , you must do ! What is wrong ? You don 't have a whistle . Alright then ... Alright , take this on your face ... Daisuke , what is this ? Let 's fight ! I am the champion ! That 's enough now ! He accepted your challenge then , eh ? Very well . Look at us , Hikaru ! That 's not fair , Hikaru . I will show you how strong I am ! You are weak , Daisuke ! Guru ... Daisuke . Why didn 't you behave like a strong man in your face-off against Bunta ? You made Goro sad ! Goro ... He trusts you a lot . I see , that seems correct in principle . What do you think of increasing the magnetic amplitude a little ? Alright , I got that ! I will try that immediately . Let me get back to you when I finish . Alright , come back , at any time . Professor , we 've spotted a UFO . Yamada , prepare the monitor now . Yes , Sir . The Mother Ship ? ! It is heading towards Mount Tsikoba ! What ? Going to Mount Tsikoba ? The Chibana Institute is in Mount Tsikoba ! What is happening ? Danger ! Watch out ! RUN ! Let 's escape ! Professor ! PROFESSOR ! What ? The Chibana Institute was attacked ? It seems like a pile of rubble . It must be their saucer . I will follow it ! Come back ! Come back ! It is dangerous to go after it ! Bu ... But ! Kouji ! Professor ! Professor Chibana and the magnetic focusing device were taken by the saucer beast ! What ? Professor Chibana ! Alright ! General Gandal ! We obtained the magnetic focusing device ! You 've done a good job , Commander Blacki ! Yes , Sir ! I have another souvenir for you , Sir . Um , what is it ? We captured Professor Chibana ! How wonderful ! Bring him here right away ! Yes , Sir ! Commander Blacki , the TFO is following us . What ? Start , Minifo ! Let them attack ! Damn ! Go and help him immediately ! Yes . Route Number 7 , Standby . Duke Fleed . Standby , Okay ! Grendizer Go ! Damn ! Duke ... Duke Fleed ! Wait ! Kouji is in danger ! I will stop chasing them now . Spin Saucer ! Hey , Kouji ! Are you alright , Kouji ? Yes , I am alright . What is the situation with the Mother Ship ? I have to retreat . I am sorry ... Good work you 've done . Commander Blacki . Install the magnetic focusing device in the saucer beast Giro Giro , right away . What about Professor Chibana ? Put him in the dungeon . No ! Put the Professor with the device in the saucer beast Giro Giro , eh ? So that if they attack Giro Giro , then they will kill the Professor . I see . What an idea ! A little more . Where are you going without my knowledge ? Huh , Hikaru ? I am going to the Institute . Kouji was injured , and I am going to see him . You can 't do that , it is not right for a young girl like you to behave this way . Let Daisuke go with you , eh ? Daisuke , come here ! I am no longer a child . Don 't tell me what to do and what not to do ! I am not a child anymore ! What ? Is this the way you talk to your father , Hikaru ? Because you say it to me a lot ! Shut up ! Oh , wait Hikaru . Hikaru , you should be happy that you have a father that takes care for you . Yes , my dear . Of course ! I am your father , Danbi ! Daisuke ! I will see you later . Daisuke , wait ! This girl is going to drive me crazy ! Oh , Kouji . Staying in bed is an obligation on you . I am fine , I am fine . I feel energetic due to the radio waves , I only need a Massage . That is good , really that is good . Hey , Goro , did you come here to visit Kouji ? Hey . Goro ! What is wrong ? It is because of you . Daisuke , listen . Will you hit Bunta in front of Goro , just once ? Goro cannot tolerate the idiot Bunta insulting you . You are to Goro more than his big brother . He trusts you ; he respects you . Therefore , he couldn 't picture you not responding to Bunta when he insulted you . He couldn 't do that . Kouji . You still don 't understand what is the true fight . You can strike your enemy physically . However , if your mind was harmed . Then there is never a cure . For this , I have distanced myself from physical fighting . Commander Blacki . As soon as the installation is complete , begin the attack immediately . Yes , Sir . We will capture Grendizer this time for sure . Father , the moon is getting covered with the red color again . They are preparing to attack us , let 's hurry . Professor , what is this exactly ? It is the destroying device , I just completed it . The magnetic force is the pulling force between the South Pole and the North Pole . Come and see Kouji . What will happen if the south magnetic field was given to the North Pole and the north magnetic field to the South Pole ? They will reverse and then explode . That 's right . I see , so the net that Professor Chibana built will be broken . Yes , but now we cannot use it except once . Only once ? Yes , if we are not able to attack the north and south poles precisely , it will be the end . But , how can you tell the north and south from them ? I don 't know yet . Professor , we captured the UFO ! There they are now . Install it on Grendizer immediately ! Yes , Sir ! I wonder , can he install it right away ? Alright , I will be the decoy . Professor , install the magnetic net towards TFO , please . The north on top and the south on the bottom . So , once the identical poles touch me , they will pull each other . But ... that 's dangerous . We don 't have any other plans in hand now . That is a risk ! We don 't have time , Professor ! I don 't agree with this method . Then what do you suggest ? I would like to strike you and go by myself , do you understand me ? Can you eliminate me with one strike ? Shall I try ? Speak ? I count on you . What is that ? It is a monster ! We will follow up the destruction from one place to another until you come out Grendizer . Duke Fleed ! Grendizer Go ! Here I come ! Okay ! There you are , Grendizer . Kouji ! I know , don 't worry ! Damn ! Well done , we have done it finally ! Now we captured Grendizer . We can celebrate now ! We can , for sure ! Yes . There it is now . The North Pole is on top of the South Pole on the bottom . Alright ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Prepare the destruction device ! Switch set ON ! Shoot ! Wh ... What is happening ? Damn ! Now I must show them the true power of Giro Giro . Yes ! Hand Beam ! Wait ! Professor Chibana was captured and he was put in the forefront of the saucer beast . Are you able to help him somehow ? Damn ! I must be careful in the attack . I only have one solution before me . And that is to jump on the body of the saucer beast and cut its head . There is no other way to save Professor Chibana . What I need now is courage that is all I need . Double Harken ! That 's right ! Dizer Jump . Idiot ! The weapon was destroyed ! They even saved the Professor ! You are so stupid ! Yes , Sir ! Goro , come here . Look at this courageous flower . It was sick under the snow from a while ago and here it is blossoming now . I think that the true courage means something like that . I decided to give you my trust , Daisuke . Thank you . Man , how he stirs my emotions . UFO ! UFO ! Launch the Mother Ship ! UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Twenty Three . Hikaru Calls for Help across the Waterfall . Huh , what has happened ? Why all of this noise , huh ? Why has fear struck you ? Alright , nothing causes any worry . Calm down , calm down ... Shiraba , how are you this morning , eh ? Danger ! What 's with her ? Wait , Shiraba ! Come back ! UFO ! That is a UFO ! Hikaru , Gore , wake up ' . The UFO saucer came ' . ! What happened , Father ? The UFO landed in the direction of the forests ! I don 't see anything , Father . Come , Father ! Enough joking about UFO ! The breaking of dawn hasn 't happened yet . I don 't joke ; it landed in the direction of the forests . Ah , now I realize why Shiraba ran away . Go and wake up Daisuke ! Go now immediately . Here I go . What is happening this morning ? Loot at this . It is a UFO . Based on its size , I say it is a saucer beast . They are trying to find Grendizer 's secret base . The Route Number 3 directs towards the basins beside the forests . They may discover it and cause us danger . Professor if they discover it , the Research Center will be in a dangerous situation . What to do ? Let 's try to draw the saucer beast away from the area by using the deception operation . Perhaps this area is in an alarming situation . That 's correct . Use the furthest Route Number 7 . Alright , I got that , I will go immediately . Good luck , Daisuke . Duke Fleed ! Grendizer , standby okay ! Understood . Launch Grendizer . Route Number 7 , gate open . Grendizer Go ! Daisuke ! Hey , Hikaru ! Where is Daisuke ? Daisuke is not here . Where did he go ? I don 't know ... Surely he must be sleeping . Not here . Then where is he ? Please Kouji , guide me to him . Wa ... wait please ! Father went out to the forests looking for Shiraba and I want Daisuke to accompany me to the forests . The forests you say ? To which forest did he go to ? The western forests . Oh , no ! Kouji , look for him and return him to us ! Yes , Sir ! Let 's go ! Shiraba ! Shiraba , where are you ? Shiraba ... I don 't see the UFO ; where it could be ? Huh ? Maybe it 's in the basin ? Space Thunder ! Hurry , hurry , hurry ! What is that noise ? Huh ... Danger ! Help ! Help ! Wait ! Help ! Anyone help ! Please stop ... Over there , Uncle Danbi ! Father ! Stop ! Stop ! Anyone help me ! Slow down ! Please stop ! Oh that is really hurts and burns ... Calm down , calm down ... Father . Where is Shiraba ? Father ... Let 's go saucer beast ! Spin Drill . Hand Beam ! Saucer beast Giss Giss , pull Grendizer to the water . Spin Saucer ! We missed him a bite . But the search for Grendizer 's secret base was successful . Return now , saucer beast Giss Giss . Damn them ! They came ! Melt Shower ! Hand Beam ! Oh , Damn ! Father , I missed the saucer beast . You shouldn 't chase it now , Daisuke . I am returning now . Be careful that they notice you . It is better that you take Route 4 . Understood . This reveals Grendizer 's movements that were revealed by our radar net . In the beginning , it appeared at point A. Then a battle happened at point B. Then it ended at point C. We guess that the secret base falls within 10 kilometers of the coverage of these three points . Then your opinion is to cover the area with a flood . Yes . Over there is a huge power station that has a large dam . If we destroy the dam , we drown the area and we accomplish complete domination . I wish we succeed . The flowing water will melt the snow of the mountains and valleys and the water will double or triple . Blacki , the idea is very good . I hope we succeed . Yes , I will immediately fulfill the flood plan . Huh , how is the situation of Uncle ? Wait please . Where were you ? I asked you how is he . Answer my question . Where were you ? You know ... ? I don 't know where ! Wait ! He went out for some important work . Kouji let him to speak ! What are you saying ? Its better that I withdraw now . If you were here Daisuke , my father wouldn 't have gone to the forests . Where did you go at such an early hour ? Tell me ! Speak ! Ah ... sorry , I was ... Please stay in ! Uncle ! Goro leave me ! Father , don 't go ! He is insists on searching for Shiraba . Father , isn 't it enough what happened to you ? We will not be able to find a genuine and beautiful mare like Shiraba . Finding her is a must ! Uncle , I will go to search for her myself . Rather , I will go to search . Hikaru , the task is dangerous for you . I can 't trust a person who hides from me where he was . Hikaru ! Come back to me , you are more important than Shiraba . I will find her and come back . Let 's go ! Wait , Hikaru ! Daisuke , stop her please ! Let 's go ! That Daisuke is malicious . Don 't follow me Daisuke . I hate you ! Shiraba is over there . Alright , I will capture her ! Don 't worry about her , leave her for me . Shiraba ... Look ! She ran away because you scared her ! Hikaru , we will go from here to the mountain . Leave me alone ! Come back , Hikaru ! Stop , Hikaru ! Professor , the interference on us is horrible ! Perfect , the water is plentiful . We are able to cause a scary flood ! Hikaru , let 's return . Shiraba is no here nearby . Please Hikaru , you seem very dry and this is not the time to be blaming others . Let 's return . Where were you ? Say where you were , please ! I ... I cannot say . Hikaru , that is dangerous ! I have to help her ! HIKARU ! Duke Fleed ! My name is ... Duke Fleed . Daisuke Umon is a man from Planet Fleed . Hikaru ... Hikaru ! Don 't touch me ! Crazy ! How do you feel now ? No , it can 't be true ! You were going to die this night ! Your clothes have dried now . Daisuke ... I don 't believe that you are a man who came from another planet . Listen , please . Men from Planet Vega are pursuing me and Grendizer . Because of that , I had to resort to disguise . I can 't understand that you are a man from a different planet Daisuke . Why did you hide this from me ? Hikaru . Please , leave me by myself now . Hi ... Hikaru ! I don 't blame her . She will need time to understand . Someone is destroying the dam ! Welcome , Duke Fleed . Blacki ! Come close . Oh , Hikaru ! If you want to save her life , take Grendizer to the bottom of this current . The bottom of this current ? The scene is not amusing if it 's only the flood . I want to see how Grendizer swims in a running tide . He wants to let the water swallow Grendizer ! Based on your decision , I will push this girl towards the dam ! Wait Blacki ! I will come back ! If they destroy the dam , then the area will be covered with a flood . We have to prevent them from destroying it at any cost . Yes . I agree with you . Kouji , take the people and the animals to safety as a precaution to negative outcomes . I got that ! Take care of Hikaru , please . Yes , don 't worry ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Release Miss Hiarku immediately ! Release the girl . Yes , Sir ! Hikaru , get away from the dam immediately ! Yes . Saucer beast Giss Giss , now destroy the middle dam ! Wait ! Hand Beam ! Damn ! Any weapon I use will destroy the dam ! That jerk Blacki look this into account , too ! Come , Grendizer ! Alright , you will see ! Daisuke ! Flood ! The water is descending ! Hurry ! They will drown right away ! Duke Fleed , please protect the great dam from destruction . Alright ! This will be the final blow . Destroy the great dam ! Daisuke ! The great dam is in danger , Daisuke ! Duke Fleed , get up please ! The great dam will be destroyed ! Duke Fleed ! Duke Fleed ! Please eliminate them ! The great dam is in danger ! No ! if the great dam is destroyed , then Hikaru will die and all the people . Screw Crusher Punch ! I will protect the great dam ! Spazer Go ! Melt Shower ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Double Harken ! Space Thunder ! Grendizer has beaten me . Next time , I will crush him to pieces ! Now it is very clear to me why you insist on disguising yourself . Daisuke , you are the guardian of this Earth . I am very delighted that you understand the situation , Hikaru . Besides that , my name is Duke Fleed . I like Daisuke Umon a lot . It is sufficient that I call you Daisuke . Thank you . Shiraba ! Shiraba returned ! UFO ! UFO ! UFO Robe Grendizer ' . Episode Twenty Four . Duke Fleed is in Danger . Japan will be the best base for invading the Earth . We must infiltrate Japan . Head towards the Earth ! How beautiful this day is ... Daisuke . What ! What ! What sound is this ? Nothing , Father . I see it seems like I imagine I was hearing a sound ? Daisuke , be careful please . Alright ! I will not let anyone come to Earth . Spin Saucer ! Small enemy objects are coming ! Alright ! This formation is only a decoy . I won 't allow you to achieve your goal ! Space Thunder ! Melt Shower ! Damn ! We failed again in infiltrating Japan . Alright , nothing is left for us except to send Minifo . That is a pointless attack ! What ' ? Who is that ' ? lam Captain Whiter , here at the communication department in the guards ' station . Excel in behavior when addressing the commander of the attack on Earth ! Do you understand ! There is no use of this attack . That is none of your concern ! It is better that you join me in infiltrating Japan . I will connect with you later . Minifo attack is useless and they will be destroyed ! What ? Will he try to give me orders , this Captain Whiter ? What rubbish is that ? Commander Blacki ! Oh , General Gandal ! Captain Whiter carries orders from the Great Vega to murder Duke Fleed ! Cooperate with him to realize success . Do you understand , Blacki ? Yes , Sir ! Captain Whiter , a space ship ahead . Alright ! Alright . To the ship ! Understood . Head for the ship ! Switch Set On ! Perfection please . Head towards Earth ! Understood ! This is a spaceship from America ; and it might be the work of the people of Planet Vega . Shall I go out to make sure ? Wait . Maybe the navigation station of America will capture it now . Do we take the matter with such ease ? If it lands in a street in the city , then a big disturbance will take place ! Don 't worry about its matter . The landing area will be at the Pacific Ocean . Welcome to out Institute . You must be exhausted Doctor . Oh , no . The space was disturbed as a result of an accident . But the information gathering device recorded some magnificent things . This is it ? Crystals that swim in the universe . And what about the light ? These crystals contain a lot of reflective beams . Is there what can extract these huge quantities of heat beams ? How magnificent it would be if you can manufacture this substance and produce it ! We won 't find a source of energy with such magnificence . We have to gather more quantities of it in order to analyze it and this is my mission . I understand , Doctor Space . This is my role with TFO in the space navigation , correct ? That 's correct , would you fulfill the task please , Mr. Kouji ? Yes , I will fulfill it and with complete pleasure ! I heard a lot about this institute . I am impressed with the magnificent devices that are in it . Thank you . Father . Oh , Daisuke . Is he your son ? I am Daisuke Umon . A truly nice lad . Isn 't that so ? He loves the farm much more than the universe . Really ? Uh ... yes. it is more beneficial for him to do what he wants . He is a kind lad , isn 't that so ? Father , did Kouji leave in the ship TFO ? One moment please . They will surely attack TFO if they notice it . I will also go , Father . Daisuke ... I think it 's safer if he knows about me . You know Doctor Space is a kind scientist . Doctor Space is worthy of trust , but who knows ? The secret may leak elsewhere ! We have to protect your secret at any price , for it is the one that leads to the peace of Earth . I understand , Father . Be prepared , and when TFO gets attacked , hurry to save it ! Yes . Wait here please . I came quickly , so I became a little tired . I will inform you when TFO returns . Thank you . From Whiter to Blacki . TFO launched . Direct the crowds of Minifo . Whiter here , do you hear me ? Direct the crowds of Minifo immediately ! Blacki direct the Minifo immediately ! Alright ! He thinks of himself as an important person , only because he is affiliated to the guards. lam Blacki and you will see . Minifo , launch now ! I don 't have time to fight with you today . I have important work to do . I won 't fight with you today ! Duke Fleed ! Grendizer Go ! Oh , there is Grendizer ! You fell , Duke Fleed . TFO will be attacked by the crowds of Minifo . You will come back with the heat reflectors from space instead of Kouji and at that time will come your hour , Duke Fleed . I will surely kill you ! Do you know ? I surpass you in flying ! Missile , launch ! You need training ! Damn you ! Damn ! Damn ! Damn ! Spin Drill ! Kouji , are you alright ? A minor hit , I am alright , don 't worry . Let 's go . Return to the institute . I will be alright . Duke Fleed , I hope you can gather for me the heat reflectors . Will do ! I got that ! Thank you , Duke Fleed . Damn ! You won 't be capable of this , Kabuto Kouji . Everything is according to schedule . This will help you , Kabuto Kouji . Alright , I will gather the reflectors from around here . Open to collect the heat reflectors . Switch Se On . I hope that these reflectors can help is developing a new energy source , in which there is good for Earth . Oh , Grendizer ! They are working with alert and care . They will hide Grendizer somewhere . But for Duke Fleed , he is to submit the reflectors to the institute . I won 't let it pass me when I see it . Then , we will eliminate you ! These emanating crystals will lead you to death ! You don 't know that it is quickly flammable and explosive . Proceed with it , Duke Fleed . What is he doing ? I love Japan ... I love saucers I love them so much ! I am Danbi ... What is that ? What is Duke Fleed doing ? Yes . Enter please . We have emanating crystals . There they are ; emanations from the universe ! Thank you . You have achieved the task faster than my expectation . How much do you need for the analysis ? We need two or three . I will analyze them , too . When ? When , Duke Fleed ? I have become tired . Alright , I will rest here a little . It 's not possible ; this joke of a person ! This weather is warm ; it makes me sleepy ... It might be Duke Fleed ; I will go to make sure . If he is Duke Fleed , he will remember my face and he will be startled when he sees me ! Don 't disturb my nap ! That is an annoying dream . A man from another planet always tricks me ! Today , that will not happen . A man from another planet is facing me . This is an annoying dream ... My God ! What ? Him ? If he is not Duke Fleed , then who could it be ? I am sure ! It 's not Umon or Kouji . Maybe it 's someone that works there . Maybe ... correct ! It is him ! Where is Father I wonder ? I knew that , I am not mistaken , Daisuke is Duke Fleed ! Duke Fleed ! Daisuke is him ? ! I will go from here , it is a shortcut ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ... Daisuke ... Daisuke ! Why you want to see Daisuke ? You saw who I really am ? Daisuke ... Daisuke ! Wait ! He " ) me ! Daisuke ... Hikaru ! Daisuke ! My guess was right it is him ! I will send you to hell ! Hikaru !

Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Alright ! Double Harken ! Come now ! Attack ! Take this ! Damn ! To hell , Duke Fleed ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Space Thunder ! Now give me a huge powerful thrust ! Spazer Go ! Melt Shower ! Ah , what is that ? Alright ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! A fierce fight , the danger on Earth will increase . Daisuke . Let me put it for you . Thank you . Hikaru , don 't come to the Research Institute , for the place is dangerous . I will come . You are Duke Fleed . We won 't know when anything happen to you . I will come at the time I please . And I also hate those who wish to cause corruption on Earth . I will never forgive them , Daisuke . UFO ! UFO ! UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Twenty Five . A Flower of Love Bloomed in The Sky . Professor ! An unidentified flying object is approaching ! What ? Yamada ! Magnify it with the electronic telescope wave . Yes , Sir ! A meteor ? No it is not ... Professor , it 's going to fall on the Virgin Forest from the mountain ! What happened ? A burning flame fell into the Virgin Forest ! Could it possibly be a meteor ? No , I think it 's a UFO . Truly , Kouji is a smart fellow . Please investigate it , eh ? Wait Daisuke ! Even if you went , you will never be able to help . Its better that you return ! My God ! They are soldiers from Planet Vega . Where do they think they are ? ! Alright ! I will punish you ! Let 's hurry ! Oh , Naida ? ! You are Naida ! Isn 't that so ? It is you Naida ! It is me ... Duke Fleed ! Duke ... Yes , Duke Fleed that was on Planet Fleed ! You are the Duke ? Ah , yes I am the Duke , Naida . Duke ... Naida ... Duke ... Naida ... Duke ... I thought I will never meet you again in my life . Me too . Naida I never thought we will meet again . I am so happy to see you alive ; I thought you were killed when they attacked Planet Fleed . I am so happy that you survived ! General Gandal ! General Gandal ! Oh , General Gandal , this is an emergency ! What is it ? The saucer beast that was directed towards Earth from Planet Vega was captured and destroyed ! I think that Naida , who was imprisoned in Planet Fleed , was in the saucer beast . Uh , but ... I wonder what happened to her ... The soldiers chased Naida , but at that moment and to our misfortune , this saucer beast appeared , and then she disappeared ! And now , all we have to do is attack that area and destroy the farm and the others completely ! Don 't worry ! But ... We will success this time . This is one of our plans as you know , understand ? What do you mean ? Naida is piloting the saucer beast on purpose . Naida and Duke Fleed are childhood friends they will reunite . And for that , all the instructions are registered in Naida 's brain . In her brain ? ! The only word that can describe Planet Fleed after its fall in the hand of the terrorist Vegan Empire , is hell ! A few of those individuals who survived were taken as hostages for labor and for their research , then a horrible death . I tried to escape many times for salvation , but I used to fail . I used to always believe in miracle ... But my escape this time seems like a dream . Naida , you shouldn 't worry from now on . The people here are all nice . You will forget all your tragedies experienced on Planet Fleed if you settle in this beautiful place , Naida . We have grass , trees and a beaming sun as there was on Planet Fleed , and the more important thing is the love of the people ... In the past , Planet Fleed was a beautiful place . You and I grew up to be brother and sister in Planet Fleed . We were disorderly at times and our parents would punish us , isn 't that right ? But , we were not as disorderly as your little brother , what 's his name ? What was his name ? Tell me ... Shireous . Oh , that 's right Shireous used to follow us all the time and make us afraid with his worms and animals he carry with him . I believe Shireous is fine now and happy . What is wrong ? Shireous died ... Died ? ! How ? ! He was murdered a traitor killed him . What you are saying ? Who is he ? Who is he ? A man from Planet Vega ? A man from Planet Fleed ? I can 't believe that there is a villainous man on Planet Fleed , answer me ! You have saddened me . Oh , I am sorry ; I was disturbed . If that is correct ... I will not forgive that traitor . I will kill him with my both hands ! I will not forgive that traitor ! I will revenge for what happened ! Shireous , you are foolish , why did you part with life ? Duke , I have loved you the whole time . Not a moment passes by , except that I think of you ... Duke Fleed is a traitor . No ! No ! Duke is not a traitor ! Shut up and settle down ! Listen to me carefully ! Duke Fleed is a traitor and to save himself , he escaped on Grendizer and left you . Do you understand ? You understood , isn 't that so ? Alright , you must find the traitor and kill him ! Him and Grendizer as well ! Did you understand ? Don 't forget and keep that in your mind ... Wake up beautiful . Come on let 's run . Let 's go . What is occupying your mind ? Hurry up and follow me . Hurry ! Come on , Naida ! I will pull you by your hand , huh ? Are you ready ? Let 's go ! Yahoo ! Yahoo ! Naida ! Naida ! Why don 't you yell with me as well ? Come on try it . Duke Fleed ! Duke Fleed ! I located it , and finally I found Grendizer . And if I eliminate it , I can pulverize Grendizer ! Watch out , danger ! Naida , watch out ! You were about to get burned to death ! Did you forget that anyone other than me automatically gets hit by Grendizer if he gets close to it , Naida ? What are you hiding behind you ? An atomic bomb ? ! Why is this with you ? Tell me why ! To blow you up ! To blast the traitor ! Why , why do you describe me as the traitor ? Don 't say that you forgot the whole matter . When the United Vegan Forces attacked us and when we were escaping from them , and asking for help and you escaped on Grendizer who was the only guard for Planet Fleed ! You are wrong . I fought until the end . I escaped from Planet Fleed towards Earth because that was the only way as Planet Fleed was completely destroyed ! Planet Fleed was not completely destroyed ! Look at me ; I am still alive as an example ! But ... I don 't want to hear your excuses ! You are a traitor ! You escaped towards Earth to save yourself ... and you left us all ! Naida ! That 's not true ... I loved you until that day , I loved you but ... everything is over . I will not forgive the traitor . You are killing our last opportunity to live and you are the one that we were granted in a state of desperation . The saucer beast that you destroyed was a man from Planet Fleed ! Do you know ? What is that sound ? The mind of a man from Planet Fleed is used in the saucer beast . This mind 's ability to think was killed , and was changed to a partisan mind of Planet Vega ! You still remember . The saucer beast Giro Giro . That 's was my little brother Shireous and you killed him ! That was my brother ! That was Shireous on the saucer beast Giro Giro ! Naida , go . You have become a flame of hate , so kill Duke Fleed ! Did you kill her ? No , this is only a stun gun . Carry her to the medical center immediately . Oh , Professor , there is a metal piece in Naida 's head ! It looks like something was implanted in her head . If we pull out this metal from Naida 's head then she will be healed . Alright , let 's proceed with this operation immediately . Pro ... Professor ! Unidentified flying objects are approaching the Earth . Traitor ! Kill him ! My brother ! Where is my brother ? ! Professor , Daisuke is in an agitated state ! Naida recovered her brain strength ! Where is Duke ? Where is Duke ? Who are you ? Daisuke ... No ... Duke 's friend . Where is Duke now ? He is under treatment because of the wound you caused him . I hurt him ? Did I hurt Duke ? Don 't you remember what you did last night , huh ? Pardon , what did I do last night ? You attributed Duke Fleed with treason , and you tried to blow up Grendizer ! Oh , My God ! Me ... ? Don 't oppress yourself . Someone else was directing you through brain messages . Be tranquil , for Duke Fleed is not in a bad state . The only thing is ... As you can see , he 's in a state of shock . He is unconscious , and is not in connection with the outside world . And he 's not aware of what 's going on around him . What 's worse than this is that he has no desire to live . This is dangerous , but it 's the only way to save him . What have I done ? Daisuke ! You love Duke , isn 't that right ? I think so . I love Duke also . Perhaps more than you . That 's right . Alright , I will launch Grendizer immediately ! Kouji ! I am sorry Duke , for everything I 've done , I truly loved you ! Damn ! It threatens me when I get close ! There is nobody besides Daisuke who can launch it ! Alright , I will see him . Wake up Daisuke ! Duke Fleed ! This isn 't the appropriate time for your apathy ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Naida left the place ; she felt her responsibility as you know . Kouji , please stop ! Hikaru , leave me alone ! Naida ... Yes , Naida your beloved ! Wake up ! Do you understand me , Daisuke ? ! Uncle ! Kouji , there is another solution , let us give him the electric shock . A traitor , I am a traitor . Duke , I am sorry . You 're the only one who 's capable of taking vengeance for the anger of Planet Fleed that was destroyed . You are our only hope , and our dependence is on you . I am sorry for what my hands have committed . Duke , please get well because I will give you the chance to eliminate the terrorist Vegan Empire one day . For that , I will be happy with my martyrdom . He has regained his consciousness ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ! Where 's Naida ? No ! You can 't ! You 're not strong enough ! Father , I will follow her ! I will repulse you , Nation of Vega ! Naida ! Naida ! Do you hear me , Naida ? If you can her me , answer ! Duke ... thanks God you are alright , you regained your consciousness . Naida ! Please return immediately ! NAIDA ! STOP NOW ! STOP IMMEDIATELY ! STOP NOW ! DUKE ... NAI DA ! ! NAI DA ! ! NAIDA ! NAIDA ... Naida ... I swear I will eliminate the forces of Planet Vega , so that the tragedy of our Planet Fleed is not repeated . UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Twenty Six . Skull Moon Base Successive Attacks . Come on . Come on , my beloved UFO ! UFO please answer ! I am Danbi ... Father ! Stop or the UFO will attack you and yelling won 't benefit you . Heh ? I am the president of the Friendship Association that befriends with UFO as you know . I am going to allow them to land on Earth . It 's no use , Father ! I am done with this one . Oh , Guru . Put the feed for the cows and horses . Daisuke promised to take care of them . Don 't depend on Daisuke . How is that , huh ? You have to be able to take care of them yourself , Goro . Alright , I will do it . Where are you ? What is that ? How huge this rocket is ! Is the base underground a rocket factory ? Astronauts ! Hello ! Oh , it is Kouji ! What in the world is happening , Dr. Umon , huh ? We apologize for surprising you . We started our operations secretly as we feared the Nations of Vega might delay us . Kouji and Hayashi are going to launch towards space . Did you know ? Oh , to the Moon or to Mars ? No , I will first go towards space to do some test in the Earth 's orbit . And now , Kouji and Hayashi don 't be late ! Hurry and climb into the rocket . Alright , we will all leave . See you ! See ya ! See ya ! See ya later ! Do your best ! See ya ! 30 seconds ! 30 seconds and you will launch ! The timer is set . 20 seconds ! 20 seconds and counting down ! 10 seconds ! Nine , Eight , Seven , Six , Five , Four , Three , Two , One , Zero . Launch ! This is Kouji ; Shirakaba Farm is visible on our screen . Kouji and Hayashi , execute the plan agreed upon . I got that ! General Gandal , how can their rocket be destroyed ? Successive attacks on the control ship . Yes , Sir ! Kouji and Hayashi will undertake the work to build a small station for experiments in space . And we plan to complete the station in three years . Hmm ... How did it occur for you to think of this great work , Doctor ? Because the objective of the laboratory is to search and develop matters regarding outer space . There are limited amounts of food and energy on Earth . Therefore , the resources in space are very important to our life . We start due to our need for natural resources and our success in space will put an end to war , hmm ? ... and it will allow us to establish a good relationship with spacemen ! What a beautiful plan ... Alright , I heard that there is no air in space ! You 've ruined my dreams ! That 's what I really know about space . Oh , you are right Bunta ! There are many planets with endless resources . Therefore , development of space is very necessary to humankind . Oh , that 's right ! Let 's go back now ! Hikaru , Goro , come ! I wish that no error happens with them in space . Professor , Standby Okay ! Alright ! They started the operations ! Blacki , it is disturbing to see the Earthling wandering here ; eliminate them immediately ! Yes , Sir ! Wait , Blacki ! Cut off their lanyards and let them roam in space ! Yes , Madam ! And then surely Duke Fleed will come to help them . I understood ! You will use them as a trap to lure Duke Fleed to ascend . Let Minifo continue monitoring them ; it may be possible to find their secret base . Yes , Lady Gandal . I always marvel at your suggestions ! Do you really think so ? The saucer beast Gide Gide and Minifo attack new ' . ! Professor , it is a UFO ! What ? Enlarge the picture ! Yes ! It is the UFO beast . Kouji and Hayashi are in danger ! Get ready to start immediately , Daisuke ! Yes ! Professor , the Minifo mobilized in an offensive formation . It will appear in the sky right away . It seems they are watching all our routes . Now I understand ; they planned to drop me in the space trap . Kouji ! Hayashi ! The UFO beast is coming towards you ! Stop the operation and go to the base shuttle immediately ! Alright ! I got that , we will return to the base shuttle right away . Oh , it is the saucer beast ! Hurry and get away now ! Don 't worry about me ! Calm down , Hayashi ! And finally I am done ! Let 's hurry now ! Hayashi ! Kouji ! Get away quickly ! Or else the base shuttle will be destroyed ! Kouji ! Professor ! Kouji was taken from here ! Kouji ! Do you hear me , Kouji ? Yes , I hear you ! Use the emergency jet and return to the base shuttle ! Oh ! It is not working ! It is broken ! Kouji ! I am heading out to help you ! Don 't lose hope ! Daisuke , be careful from the saucer beast ! It seems like they are planning for something ! I know that ! Because of that I will head towards you immediately , I am coming now ! I am depending on you ! I feel dizziness ... The life support system is not functional either . Father , I will go now . But the secret route will be discovered ! I must not be late . That 's right ! I have an idea ! We will launch White Rocket 2 with disturbing electronic waves devices to divert their attention . Alright , I got that ! Duke Fleed ! Duke Fleed , get ready , route number 7 . The launching of Rocket 2 ! Hey , what 's the matter ? The electric waves of this rocket are jamming on us . Damn ! Minifo ! Hit it right away ! Now it is the time , Duke Fleed ! Grendizer Go ! Watch out , Hayashi ! Duke Fleed is going towards Kouji . He will work on rescuing him ! Return to the Base immediately ! Alright , I got that ! The radio is damaged . I can 't hear anything ... Melt Shower ! Hand Beam ! Here you come , saucer beast ! General Gandal ! Grendizer is in our trap ! Destroy him and the trap , and let another UFO beast participate in the attack ! Yes , Sir ! Blacki ! Don 't neglect the Space Science Center that dreams of invading space . They sent a rocket and it is helping its ascension ! That 's good , aha . I am out of oxygen ! Duke ... Duke Fleed is coming to rescue me ... Oh , no ! That is Minifo ! Space Thunder ! Spin Saucer ! Damn ! Two beasts got hold of me ... Then I will disconnect Spazer and let it save Kouji from there . Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Oh , it is Spazer ! Double Harken ! Now ! Spazer Cross ! Kouji ! Kouji ! Duke Fleed ? ! That 's right ! Where am I ? You are in the Spazer ! Oh ... then , I am alright ... I am saved ! Yes you are alright and I am sorry for coming here late . The saucer beasts are pursuing us . Therefore , I will hurry and exit from here . Get ready for that . Alright , I got that , thank you . Let 's go ! Blacki ! Go to Earth immediately and drive Grendizer away from us ! Yes ! If I lose my life then I will fail to kill Duke Fleed ! We are close ; he is sure of arrival . Hayashi , keep yourself together ! Hurry ! Come on , Come on ! UFO , you are friends , Isn 't that so , darlings ? Don 't be harsh , UFO . They didn 't listen to me ... Father ! How terrible this UFO is . Why does it attack the farm , eh ? Let 's hurry now ! Hurry and let the animals take shelter ! Oh , the rabbit ... Take cover , Goro ! - Hikaru ! - Sister ! Sister ! Hikaru ! Control your senses ! Open your eyes please , Hikaru ! Oh , sister ! She is dying , Hikaru ... Hikaru please don 't die ! Huh ? ! They are all over the research center ! The three saucer beasts ! If I attack them , will I able to overcome them ? Kouji , go to land with Spazer . Alright ! Dizer Go ! Kouji ! Come with me quickly ! What happened , Goro ? Something terrible happened to my sister ! She is need of more blood . Is anyone of you of blood type O ? Yes , me . Take as much blood as you need . No , I fear for you . You 're of old age . Eh , anyone else ? I am type A. And I am type AB . I am type A. Seems nobody is of type O. It is vital . Let 's take her to the city 's hospital immediately . Let 's go ! I will take her ! Are you alright ? You seem very exhausted . I am alright . DAMN ! UFO I hate you now ! Yes , I hate you UFO ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Melt Shower ! Double Harken ! Space Thunder ! I did it finally ! Damn ! I am done with you , Duke Fleed ! Die in hell ! I will get you one way or another . I will get my revenge from you ! UFO . UFO . UFO Robe Grendizer ' . Episode Twenty Seven . Grendizer Counter Attack . Space Thunder ! Damn ! The electric current cut off ! Professor Umon designed a plan to build a space station . And while Kouji was busy with the operation , the saucer beast attacked him and rendered him astray . So Grendizer was dispatched to rescue him , but the saucer beast was awaiting him . Spazer Go ! Meanwhile , the Space Science Center and Shirakaba White Maiden Farm were attacked , and Hikaru was hurt . And after that Kouji was saved but the danger was awaiting Grendizer . Damn you Grendizer ! I will eliminate you ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! You won 't escape from me , Duke Fleed Pursue him , Saucer Beast ' . ! This is Duke Fleed . I am completely damaged and must return to the Center . Open the gate ! Alright , we have received the message . Route 6 open the gate . Impossible , the gate was destroyed during the explosion . What ? ! Also the third gate and the fourth gate were destroyed . What a loss ! Duke Fleed , you head what they said ? There is no way for you to return through any of the gates ! Alright ! I will find a hiding place somewhere . Anti-Radar Mist ! Commander Blacki , the radar is jammed and you will not be able to watch him . Try to repair the radar and then look for him ! Yes , Sir ! Alright . This looks like a good place to hide for now . How annoying they are ! Missile , launch ! Missile , launch ! You deserve it ! I will hurry now to bring the blood for Hikaru ! Damn ! Not again ! You want to block my path , Saucer Beast ! Missile , launch ! You bustard ! DAMN ! Damn ! We 're done ! Exit from TFO ! Kouji will bring the blood in a bit . Hold yourself together Hikaru ! This is Duke Fleed ! Do you read me , Research Center ? Do you read me , Research Center ? Huh ? It seems like ... That 's right ! The rocks here are magnetic ! No one will be able to discover my location . This is something reassuring . This is Minifo ; there is no trace of him . Failure is no permitted ! Do whatever it takes to fine him ! Find him ! Find him ! Yes , Sir ! Kouji , you have returned early ! And now , where 's the blood ? Sorry . The TFO was destroyed . But I will take the car to bring it ... Get a hold of yourself , Kouji ! His condition is bad ! I am fine , don 't worry about me . Hikaru ... HIKARU ! If it happens and you leave this world , then be sure that I will follow you ! His condition , Kouji 's condition doesn 't permit him to navigate ! Daisuke ! What happened to you ? We were worried about you ! I hid myself somewhere where their radar won 't discover it . Air compressor number 2 was damaged . Alright , we have a device for air compression that we don 't use . You take it . What is that ? TFO was destroyed ? Then what happened to Kouji ? ! Is he alright ? Professor , we have shortage of blood plasma , yes ! Blood ? For who ? Hikaru was wounded as a result of the attack on the farm and we need blood of type O. Why don 't you try my blood ? Your blood ? But you are a stranger to us ; it is not allowed . Her pulse is back to its previous state ! Hikaru ... Hikaru ... Daisuke , how do I thank you and return you the favor ? You are all very dear to my heart . You are the savior ! It is very strange that your blood type is compatible with our blood type . I think I will devote enough time one day to analyze Daisuke 's blood type . Was a resemblance to this type ever seen before ? Hikaru ... Daddy ... You were going to lose your life if it wasn 't for Daisuke 's blood . Daisuke ... his blood ? I came before it was too late , thanks God you are saved . Thank you . The squadron of Planet Vega is coming ! What ? ! The saucer beast with lots of UFO 's ! Damn ! You will pay the price ! Uncle ! Slow down ! They are scoundrels and evil doers as you know . So don 't act foolishly ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Daisuke is right , don 't follow their same method . Leave everything to us , Danbi . Now , get out of here , Daisuke ! Get out of here , let 's go ! Why ? I can go with you if I want ! We have to stay here to transport the air compression device and it is better for you to exit from here and go ahead of us . I agree , I promise that we will bring you what you need . Alright , I got that . I am going now . You are Dr. Umon ? That 's right . Let 's go ! Wh ... What are you going to do with us ? Shut up ! I am Commander Blacki from the United Forces from Planet Vega ! You filthy persons ! You have caused harm to my dear daughter ! I will punish you ! Don 't think I am a friend of yours ! You are my enemy and I will punish you ! All of you take him outside and kill him . Yes , Sir ! Wait ! Don 't do that ! The old man is the owner of a nearby Shirakaba farm ! His daughter was hurt , have mercy on him ! I won 't have mercy on him if he plays the role of the fool . All of you throw him outside . What ? ! Who do you think you are to order to kill me ? Danbi , control your temper . Don 't forget that you are my enemies ! And we , Dr. Umon , came for Duke Fleed . Duke Fleed ! I don 't know anything ! Impossible ! And this Research Center is planning for the operation to invade space and this by itself is a sufficient reason to grasp you ! The operation of developing outer space is a great value to humanity ! And you are performing this operation with the encouragement of Duke Fleed ! I really don 't know anything ! Don 't act you stupid person ! You bustard ! If you want to play the role of the fool Doctor , then I will really turn you into a fool ! Switch on the machine ! Rise up the speed ! Yes . And now , tell me where is Duke Fleed ? ! I don 't know ! Make the machine spin at its full power ! Yes ! Stop the machine now ! Yes , Sir ! Doctor I will not leave you until you tell me ! Pro ... Professor ! Remain here and behave yourself ! What pity ! Gandal , GANDAL ! Yes , Sir ! Here , my master Vega . Blacki was not able to find Duke Fleed . Therefore , I want you to help him . Yes , Sir ! Grendizer was damaged and if we find it , then it will be within our hands in a blink of an eye . I will find it in any way then I will destroy it ! And on top of that , Dr. Umon is working on the operation to develop outer space and keeping him alive won 't do . Then I will send Dr. Umon and Duke Fleed to hell together . Hmm ... Abnormal blood ... I wonder what Daisuke and Kouji are doing now ? No ! Don 't move Hikaru , you haven 't recovered yet ! I feel even better than before and that 's all because Duke ... I mean Daisuke and his blood ! Huh ? Then that is the reason . I will go now to search for Kouji and the others . Wait Hikaru ; let me first check your blood so I can make sure you are okay ! Come here ! Take this ! Kouji , are you there ? Hikaru . Are you alright , Kouji ? They are torturing us every two hours ; we can 't hold out . I think we should inform Duke Fleed about the matter ! Duke Fleed ... Yes , Duke Fleed blood is flowing through my body , believe it ! Hikaru , did you already know that Daisuke and Duke Fleed are one person ? Where is he now ? Leave everything to Daisuke ; I think that your health has not improved yet . No , it has improved a lot ! I am fine . Don 't worry . Alright , then take this note and deliver it to him when you see him . Where to , girl ? The Commander asked me to deliver this to you . Take this . I must hurry to inform Daisuke of the matter ! Commander Blacki and his men took over the Research Center . Therefore , you must think of a way to get them out so that we can transport the air compression device . The operation takes around thirty minutes . Thirty minutes to be completed . Alright , I will transform into Duke Fleed as a first step . Dr. Umon was taken hostage , and they are torturing him . You must help him . That is regrettable , I didn 't know ... I will try to get the men out of the Center , eh ? What are you saying ? I am serious ! I am able to get them out ! Impossible ! But Dr. Umon will be killed if we don 't help him ! We have to act fast . If you fail you will die , do you know that ? There is no other solution at the moment . Get on the horse Daisuke , let 's go ! Move ! Do you want to lose your life , you fool ? Commander Blacki ! This girl will tell us the place of Duke Fleed . She says that she knows where he is . Is that right ? I don 't want you to torture Dr. Umon any more than that . Alright , take us to him . Let 's go ! I will come to help you shortly , Hikaru . Who 's there ? ! Father ! Daisuke ... Let 's go , let 's hurry ! I didn 't find the place for I can 't think when I am at this altitude . Let 's descend to the ground . Daisuke , fix it quickly ! I will do ! Is the distance long ? No , we are getting really close . I hope that the plan succeeded . Come quickly to help me , Daisuke ! Where is that place ? How do we reach it ? Blacki you idiot ! Oh , it is Ge ... General Gandal . That girl tricked you ! You are a real stupid . I have found the Research Center empty ; they must have fixed Grendizer now ! Damn you ! I will kill you ! Damn you , Duke Fleed ! Everyone go to battle immediately ! Melt Shower ! Spin Saucer ! Spin Drill ! Your mistake is terrible , Blacki ! Yes , Sir ! I will bear the responsibility ! Attack now , Guru Guru and Hado Hado . Hikaru , a little more . Damn ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Hikaru ! Are you alright ? Duke Fleed ! We will end everything . You did a great job , thank you . Hold on tight . - We will be back to where we started unless we do something else ! - Alright ! Dizer Kick ! Hado Hado won 't be able to ever the cave . Double Harken ! Hado Hado ! Attack the cave from the top and flatten it ! Attack him now ! Destroy him ! Hand Beam ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Go ! Screw Punch ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! ... You idiot ! Space Thunder ! General Gandal , go to your space saucer immediately ! You , what are you going to do ? I will remain to fight Grendizer and eliminate him ! AI ... Alright . Duke Fleed , you will pay the price for all of this . You will pay it dearly ! DIE ! Hand Beam ! Melt Shower ! Space Thunder ! DUKE ... As we saw , Blacki died in the battle . We must not submit to the pressure of the Nation of Vega because the future of mankind depends on the development of the plans of outer space . UFO . UFO . Get ready to receive the beam , Damn you , Grendizer ! I must eliminate you from existence ! UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Twenty Eight . The Bell of The Devil in The Dark . Gandal . It seems like your wound has healed , eh ? Yes , look at it . Ah , it 's fully recovered . Gandal . Yes . Blacki was brought down as you know . Therefore , I will assign you as Commander of the Attack Forces starting from today . Thank you so much , and I vow to conquer the Earth without doubt . My Master Vega . Lady Gandal , what happened to your face ? It has surely changed . I have accomplished my mission sacrificing my life and despite that , you have lowered my military rank . Thus , sadness has struck me . Oh , on the contrary , your military rank hasn 't changed , and the new rank is additional work . Understood ? Yes . That 's good . There is another matter . What is it ? I am listening to you . I will join you with the Minister of Science Zuril . Minister of Science Zuril ? You don 't know him . But he is a notable scholar with Planet Zoro that is allied with the forces of Planet Vega . Then , the Minister will be under my instruction . We have broadened your mission ; you need an assisting colleague . Assisting colleague ? Then , we will be in the same level and rank ! Working with Minister Zuril is necessary to invade the Earth as fast as possible , that is your mission . By your leave , Master Vega . Minister of Science Zuril ? What type of person is he ? Damn it is another failure . How is the work going with you ? Errors every time , I don 't know how to proceed . Wait Kouji , are you facing burdens ? It 's not your habit to complain . Weren 't you excited to build a new and original space saucer ? Yes , that 's correct . But the matter doesn 't seems as easy as I thought . Yes , remember that you are building something new and original and accomplishing it won 't be until after tiring work . I know that . Daisuke , it looks like you are not doing much these days . Huh ? It must be that the attack that was executed on components of Planet Vega was strong so it silenced them and they are quiet for a while . Huh , I hope that this is indeed what happened to them . Truly , you are correct . I doubt they will let us rest for long , I expect an attack from them at any moment Kouji , I am sure of that . Alright , I will try it again . The Allied Forces of Planet Vega don 't delay in fulfilling their aggressive aims . We must expect more of their terrifying assaults . I am sure they won 't stop invading the Earth . I wonder who this Zuril is ? Minister of Science ? General Gandal , The Minister Zuril is headed to you . Are you the Minister Zuril ? That is the Earth , what a beautiful planet . We will land on Earth , and Japan is the best base to invade Earth . In the beginning , we will establish the base first . That is not new ! And in order to accomplish it , we must bring down Grendizer first . If it wasn 't for Grendizer , we would have established the base without obstacles ! War doesn 't start with weapons only ! What do you mean ? By infiltrating the enemy 's territory and causing them chaos , guile and trickery . A beautiful innovative opinion , but would you clarify to us the modality of infiltrating the enemy 's territory before everything ? This way . What is that ? A creature that resembles the human from the Bell Planet that is allied with the Vegan Military Forces . I see . I 've heard of the existence of such midgets that resemble the human . A small creature like this one can easily infiltrate those areas . I am wondering about the ability of such a small saucer . Haven 't you hear of the story of the King of the beasts , the lion ? Even the small insects like ants can overcome the strongest of lions if they work together . I look forward to seeing you in the battlefield , Minister . In the beginning , we must choose the point of infiltration . Perhaps the best point to perform the suspicious trick is this camouflaged area near the capital here . Is that place . Don 't loiter , Daisuke ! Pay attention ! Hurry so we can go , let 's go ! Daisuke , I don 't see a need to waste your time with Father like this . Pardon , don 't mind me . We welcome you , Daisuke , but your important work calls for you . I know , if something new happens , don 't worry . I understood . What are you saying , you two ? Didn 't I request speed ? Hurry , let 's go ! Let 's go quickly ! The Saucer Beast Ber Ber , launch immediately ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Increase your speed ! Don 't much about you slow poke ! Let 's go ! It is wrong to get out in this weather , Father ! We don 't know where we are heading ! Shut up when you are accompanying me ! And now hurry up ! The rain is rampant ! ls everything alright ? Yes , until now everything is alright . I still don 't know our destination . Are we going to visit the cemetery ? Cemetery ? ! Yes , Father was born in that town and he doesn 't have a house nor friends now . Huh , I thought we were going to a better place , but visiting the cemetery was not in mind . Goro , stop that talk ! It is necessary to visit the family 's graveyard , to revive the memories of our ancestor . Other than that , we have important work awaiting us today . In all cases , there 's only a little left ; let 's hurry ! This place is deserted as it seems . In the past , it was an established village with many people . Stupid , they left their village unoccupied and deserted as you can all see . Oh , what is that sound ? This is the crew of Saucer Beast Ber Ber ; we have just descended to the area of our destination . Alright . I want you now to receive the remaining crews and to establish a base for you there . It is possible that this area may have some inhabitants , in the event of their presence , erase them from existence ! Don 't allow anyone to live ! I got that ! - This is what I was going to tell you about . - What is it ? In truth , I was planning on tell you the story when you are both grown up , but I can 't endure patience . What is it ? This was left for us by our ancestors to use when necessary . Do you understand now ? Huh , it 's a special heritage . That 's correct . A treasure that surpasses everything ! Our Makiba family had a great history in wars ! And now the time has come to revive those memories . Is that you ? I was wondering who was here , Mr. Danbi . It is me Father . I left these things in your trust for a while , respected father , in order to fight the invaders . Oh , what ? Invaders ? UFO , they are a crew of invaders with the intention of attacking Earth . And since I am the head of the Association to Protect Earth from UFO 's invasion , I am Makiba Danbi insist on fighting them . I will fight them ! You are outstanding ! Don 't praise him up too much ! But isn 't it better for us to fight UFO the invaders as rivals ? Yahoo ! I am ready now ! Come whenever you want , you UFO 's ! What happened ? Oh , it is that sound again ! That 's it ! That 's the sound ! What is that ? What happened ? What took place ? My God ! What is that ? A UFO , isn 't that so ? Yes . A UFO small in size and operates by electromagnetic waves . Yes , yes ! I knew the presence of the UFO from the first look . If it knew about our place then it will eliminate us for sure . We will be fine if we get away from them quietly . Daisuke ! We have to ask for help before it is too late . The telephone lines have been cut , so how will we ask for help ? Alright , I will sneak out of here quickly and inform the group . You are vibrating . Wait , don 't go ! I am only nervous because I am excited to fight ! Let me do that instead of you ! Damn ! Complete silence . Maybe they are watching ... Truly , he is a good youth who has a future . I used to always feel ... Daisuke ... Daisuke is in danger ! - Damn ! Do your best , Daisuke ! - He will be alright , for Daisuke never made a mistake until now . Daisuke , do your work well . Damn ... Damn you ! The sound ... the sound is coming towards us ! You dirty cowards UFO ! I can 't take any more of this ! Here I come . Please , wait ! Listen to me UFO ! I am the head of the Association to Protect the Earth from invasions from Outer Space . My name is Makiba Danbi and I am here to fight you , you cowards ! Here I come . Daisuke ! Daisuke ! Daisuke , keep yourself together . Daisuke , what happened ? Tell me what happened ! I will tell you in a bit for I must hurry now ! Daisuke ! What destroyed the sword ? Duke Fleed ' . ! Grendizer Go ! I am the one ... I will kill you with my broken sword ... I am the gallant hero ... Grendizer appeared ! What do we do , Zuril ? Don 't be scared , even the small ants can overcome the big lion with teamwork . The Saucer Beast Ber Ber , attack him immediately ! Huh ? Here they come ! Spin Saucer ! Spin Drill ! Their number is great ; we cannot confront them due to their small size and quick motion . Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Damn you all ! Huh ? What happened ? That 's right , I am Makiba Danbi , and they got scared of me and ran away . That 's what happened ! Father ! Daddy ! You did a real great work . Huh ' ? Duke Fleed ' . ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Damn ! Double Harken ! What a strong creature ! You haven 't given up yet ? You are waiting your time ! Now , Saucer Beast Ber Ber , attack him and give him a death blow ! Dizer Punch ! It 's no use confronting them ! The number of those saucers doesn 't diminish , and it seems like this saucer beast will never perish . What is that ? ! Huh ? Those black spots ! That means that their saucer beasts number decreased . And now let 's see ... Ten thousand minus one , nine thousand nine-hundred and ninety-nine , and so is this beast with the black spots ! Alright ! Grendizer won 't be able to move one inch . A bizarre matter , you possess super power ! Now you can play with him as you please . Space Thunder ! Lucky for me that I saw those black dots . If it wasn 't for that , he would have been a stubborn opponent . I am convinced that you appreciate Grendizer 's power ! Don 't continue . Be sure that next time ... I will erase Grendizer and send him to the depths of hell ! UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Twenty Nine . Farewell of The Friend That is Coming from Space . Hmm ... so this is the compression cell ? We compress ourselves thus we become small creatures . You mean this body is able to compress and shrink ? That 's right . But this currently applies to the inhabitants of Planet Delta who are able to withstand the pressure with their strange body cells . I see . Send in Commando Haruko . Follow up with the operation plan . Continue to monitor the Space Science Center and locate Grendizer 's base . Yes , Sir ! Wait a moment ! What 's the matter ? Fifteen men lost their lives during the experiments . General Gandal ! Haruko responded to his own will . Okay but , can 't you find someone else ? General Gandal ! I don 't care about the pain or danger to fight Grendizer ; I am under orders . Great , we will set up a statue for you in Planet Delta ! You will be a legend of your planet , a legend everyone talks about . I prefer that the statue is set up in a square over which doves fly . Doves ? Yes doves ; I 've loved them since my childhood . Listen , endure no matter how strong the pain is . The Cell Compressor ! Switch Set On ! Oh . My God ! What ? What is wrong ? You really amaze me , little Goro ! - My homework is to feed the turtledove starting this week , but I forgot . - Turtledove ? Yes ! It was injured and fled to us so we decided to look after it . That is magnificent ! Mmm ... Goro is performing an important duty ; great . Good bye ! Oh , who are you ? Hey , you ! You ! Strange boy ! Who is he ? I 've never seen him before . Hey ! Come on , come on ! Get him ! Do it ! Do it ! All of you ! Quiet , please . It is you ! A new friend arrived today . His name is Haruko ldiora . Haruko ldiora ? Haruko 's family trades in antique furniture . They recently moved and haven 't gotten used to the area yet . I want you all to treat him well , promise ? Yes ! He fives dose to Mamba Gore , its appropriate that you share the same desk . Ye ... Yes . Haruko , this is Goro Makiba . Thank you for feeding the turtledove , Haruko . I love that bird . Me too . Let 's be friends then ! Nice to meet you . Oh , his hand is so cold ... A new student came today to my school . He loves the turtledove . We became friends . Good Goro , then you both will get along . But he is a strange person . Hmm ... what 's the matter ? I shook his hand and it was wet , sticky and cold . What 's wrong ? No , sorry , nothing ! This attribute is rampant in what resembles the human , I wonder if he is one of them ? Could it be ? ! Hey , you ! Good bye ! See you later , until we meet , bye ... You are friends with the staff at the Space Science Center , right ? Huh , how did you know ? A student in the class told me . I would love it if you take me there , do you mind ? No , not at all . I am very interested in sciences . Really ? You resemble me . We both like turtledoves and science . Hey . Goro ! You are back from school ? Yes , Kouji . Oh ? This is my friend Haruko . He would like to look at the Research Center , do you allow him ? I doubt that he will be allowed . He doesn 't have permission . These are the orders . Flying saucers from Planet Vega are watching us . Did you understand ? Sorry , but he will have to return to his house . Oh , I am sorry . No problem . Huh ? Hey , Haruko ! Haruko , wait ! He is a strange kid . Haruko , how 's your situation ? Did you follow the plan ? As I expected . The Research Center is well secured and equipped with infrared cameras . This complicates matters further , but there 's got to be a way . By helping a turtledove I befriended Goro . However , I was denied access to the Center . But they didn 't allow me to get in . A turtledove ' ? Yes , the students are taking care of it . If you were not allowed to enter , then use the turtledove to monitor the inside of the Center . Huh ? The turtledove ? Transform it into a surveillance , understand ? But , how ? Haruko ! Our main objective is to destroy Grendizer . You can immediately send the Saucer Beast Dera Dera ! Idiot ! We won 't lose our reason ! We must first locate Grendizer 's base ! Mi ... Minister ! Do you know that the effect of the compressed cells will last only another day from now ? Bu .. but .. Haruko ! I know that you love doves a great deal . But you must avoid personal influences if you insist on reaching your great goal ! Haruko ! You are brave , Haruko . To conquer the enemy , you must conquer yourself first , this is the way of the brave . Haruko , the entire plan must be fulfilled . Go now ! My God ! Oh my God ! Not here , not here ! Didn 't you see the turtledove at all ? You are the one that took it ! Speak ! Speak now ! I don 't know . Don 't lie . Let us enter your house and search . Let 's go ! Be truthful ! Hey , wait a little . Haruko said he doesn 't know anything . It 's unjust for you to be mean to him . But ah ... I bear the responsibility because I volunteered . The fault is mine . I give my apology . Haruko ... Minster Zuril , I have succeeded in monitoring the inside of the observation room . Alright . We will immediately dispatch Saucer Beast Dera Dera . Continue monitoring , understood ? Roger ! Alright , Saucer Beast Dera Dera , move immediately ! I wonder why Haruko has been absent from school ? Professor , a flying saucer is flying in this direction ! What ? What is the matter ? Seems to be a saucer beast . Damn ! If TFO was here I will attack them immediately ! Daisuke ... Daisuke ... What is it ? A saucer beast is approaching ! Professor , an unidentified signal is being transmitted from somewhere on the top of Mount E. What , Mount E ? Father , maybe the enemy has infiltrated into Mount E , this matter must be confirmed . Daisuke , Goro went to visit his friend 's house in Mount E , is he going to be alright ? WHAT ? ! Do you remember a kid who was recently transferred to his school ? I shook his hand but it was sticky and so cold . Hikaru , why did Goro go there ? The students blamed the kid because he lost the turtledove , so he hated going to school . Did you say a turtledove ? Yes , Goro trusted the kid . I think he went to cheer him up . A turtledove ' ? ! Father , look for a turtledove flying in the area , and if you find it , it might be that it is spying on us . Inform me of the matter immediately . Alright , understood . It is Gore 's friend then ! Maybe Goro got into trouble . I must bring him back quickly . Yes . Turtledove ! Where ? Alright ! Huh ? What happened ? Damn it ! The compressing ray is beginning to disengage ! He is over there . You are here ! What do you want from me ? Why did you kill the turtledove ? The turtledove ? Why did you do that ? I brought you this gift . I want your friendship , Haruko . You will never understand me , even if I explained to you the matter . There is no need for you to tell me if you don 't want to . I know ; you have a worthy reason . Hey , what happened to you ? It 's over ! You will finally know everything ! You shouldn 't have come , you should 've cut your relation with me . Since you came here , I can 't let you return home . You will now know what creature I really am . As you can see , I am the Commando Haruko from Planet Delta . You were kind to me ; I hate to kill you . But I can 't let you live since I 've been revealed to you . No ! No ! Leave me , let me go ! Let me go ! Duke Fleed . ! Grendizer Go ! No , there is no use ! Did they discover our secret ? Command Haruko , what happened to you ? Do you know that Grendizer went out to fight ? Oh , Damn ! It seems like that I was revealed to them ! Idiot ! Fight now for your life . You will not return to the base until you eliminate Grendizer ! I prefer that , Sir ! are you going to kill me ? There 's no escape ; this is part of my mission . Your love for the doves is a lie ! Were you lying ? You were lying ? No , I did not lie . I was truthful . Why did you kill the bird then ? Say Why ! Shut up ! I used to raise doves on Planet Delta , truly ! That 's the true ! If it wasn 't for the war , I would have spent my life in love and in the murmuring of the doves . However , the war changed everything in me . Before I noticed the matter , I became a man killing doves without hesitation . I never really noticed that , and people called me Haruko the Hero , and I was granted distinction . I became a man who did anything without hesitation to accomplish his mission ! No ! I can 't do it ! Run immediately ! Don 't you hear the alarm ? You must hurry for this damned machine is about to self-destruct shortly ! Hey , you ! Good luck ! GORO ! Sister ! Goro ! Duke Fleed , I let Goro escape in peace . Let our fight be fair , what 's your opinion ? That suits me . I think you are a smart champion , what 's your name ? Tell me ! The Commando Haruko from Planet Delta . Let 's fight ! Spin Saucer ! Spin Drill ! This fighting isn 't conclusive . Duke , if you want to conquer me , then why don 't we fight risking our lives ? Alright ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Screw Punch ! Chain Thunder ! Shoulder Boomerang ! You almost succeeded ! But I feel that a great load has been lifted off my shoulders ! Double Harken ! Your turn has come ! You won 't escape from Haruko the Hero , and the Chain Thunder is his weapon ! Shut up ! The one loves doves love piece and not war ! What ? ! Now is the chance ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Double Harken ! I did it ! Did this man really love doves ? Who really loves doves abandons the calling of evil and destruction . In any case , we lost a delicate personality . UFO . UFO . It is the Lion ! The Lion ? What happened to him in this late time ? Look ! He destroyed the cage ! Let 's hurry and return him to the cage ! Al ... Alright , let 's do it now ! He will kill us . Are you alright ? What is wrong with him ? What is this small rock ? UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Thirty . Story of the Red Eschar . Oh my God , how ? A small rock like that can emit such electric power ? Now I understand the lion 's behavior when it was shocked . I knew that the lion survived , I hear it was only shocked for a short while , that 's what they say . He is lucky . Professor , I wonder what this meteor is ? A substance radiating electricity ? Yes , Father . Is the meteor synthetic or natural ? Huh ? Synthetic ? There must be one of their weapons ! No , it is definitely a natural substance . This means there is substances in the universe that radiate electricity like it . Isn 't it so , Father ? Correct , and I think this is just a small part of it , as there are bigger sizes in the universe . If we figure it out , we will have a great source of energy ! It hasn 't been discovered yet , though there is so much of it . There is no time to sit down like this . Hold on , Kouji ! Don 't go so fast ! Be patient , please . Don 't keep me here ! I must finish the new flying saucer for Dr. Umon 's Space Development Project . A great source of energy and a lethal weapon if it falls in the hands of the enemy . Is the work proceeding ? And it will finish as soon as planned . It 's a great idea to build the saucer using rock from Planet Goda . The entire surface of Planet Goda is covered with this stone . What an amazing small rock ! Give the final command . Connect the operating system to the saucer beast Goda Goda . Alright , hurry and follow up with the work ! We can now fight Grendizer with this saucer , and beat him ! Mission accomplished . Huh ? It is slightly different from the original design . This is enough . Heh , the first experimental saucer was completed here . I will fly it in front of Daisuke and Hikaru . Saucer Beast Goda Goda , get to work ! I long to find out the powers of the Saucer Beast Goda Goda . Saucer Beast Goda Goda , prepare to attack ! Fire and attack ! What a luck ! A fierce storm on my first day of flight . Postpone it today that is better . Postponing is never possible ! We must launch a new flying saucer right away , we can 't waste time . And are you able to take off in the storm ? This rain doesn 't concern me at all ! Hey , wait , Kouji ! It is true that we must finish the new flying saucer . But if you fail then what shall we do ? Think about the matter well . Don 't worry about me . Leave the matter to me ! Kouji , wait ! Stop , Kouji ! It is very dangerous ! Stop ! Don 't worry , the rain won 't stop me , I don 't care . Daisuke ! Tragedy , the lightening ruined my experiment ! You are alright , Daisuke , huh ? Huh ? What happened to Daisuke ? A pipe fell on him while he was protecting you with his body , don 't you know what happened to Daisuke ? It 's your entire fault ! A Pipe ? The issue is minor , it just hit my arm . Are you alright , Daisuke ? Did I hurt you , Daisuke ? I am fine , truly . I am alright . Thank you . I am sorry , Daisuke ... Professor , a flying object is approaching ! Alright , we magnify it with the electronic telescope . A flying saucer ! Father ! A saucer from the Allied Vegan Forces . Get to work now ! Yes . Daisuke ! Daisuke ! What happened to you , Daisuke ? Get a hold of yourself ! My arm ... Don 't use Anodyne . It 's an unusual wound . So what is it ? It might be ... no . I wouldn 't know until I examine it closely . Daisuke ! Daisuke , be brave . Saucer Beast Goda Goda destroys everything it passes by so Grendizer will come to the scene and then I send him to hell this time ! To hell Grendizer ! That is what I expected . Professor ? ! An injury caused by radioactivity . Nonsense ! A strike by an iron pipe , what does radioactivity has to do with it ? It might not be a recent wound . It is a wound from the past that got inflamed anew . No , no that 's incorrect . Daisuke ! It is my mistake ! If I hadn 't insisted on accomplishing the mission ... Daisuke wouldn 't have gotten hurt ! Kouji ! What 's going on with Daisuke ? Can 't he work ? The flying saucer is destroying everything in the city now ! Quiet . Mr. Danbi ! Watch out ! The life of the nation is in danger ! I am coming ... Huh ? Watch out ? I realized that a UFO is invading us , eh ? Isn 't that correct ? Ah ? Mr. Danbi , that is correct . Take care of everything during my absence , Bunta . I am ready to fight you enemy ! The first flight for this Saucer Number 1 . A decisive battle against the saucer of the Allied Vegan Forces . Listen , be good and fly in the air ! Daisuke , watch me ! I will correct my mistake ! Daisuke ! Don 't worry , he lost consciousness . Will the wound be healed with this ? The wound will not be completely healed in a short time , the pain will subside . Hikaru , hold his arm for a bit . Okay . Daisuke , be brave . Let 's go ! I am coming , coming ! Huh ? What is that ? The UFO ! The damn UFO ! I will destroy it with this arrow ! What I have done ? You coward ! You got out of the way ! Wait that is cowardice from you ! WAIT ! That is you ! Here I come ! Damn ! I would 've brought the weapons if the sky didn 't cause lightening . Daisuke ... Daisuke ... How is your wound , does it hurt you ? I am alright . Take a look . Stop , Daisuke ! Your wound is not a normal injury , believe me ! It is an Eschar from radioactivity . It seems like you were inflicted with it from a long time ago . Do you remember anything ? It is an Eschar from Vegatron radioactivity . Vegatron radioactivity ? It was the last day on Planet Fleed . It is an affliction from when a bomb of the Allied Vegan Forces went off . I am going to work . Until we meet . Daisuke ! Daisuke ! Duke Fleed ! Grendizer , Standby Okay ! Dizer , move immediately ! Route 7 , Gate Open ! Grendizer Go ! I knew this wound was going to hurt me . But it doesn 't matter , I 've got time . My weaponless experimental saucer is not on par with it . Oh . Kouji ! Take this , you saucer beast ! Spin Drill ! Huh ? What is that ? Kouji ... It is Kouji ! Hey , pull yourself together , woke up ! Uncle Danbi ? ! Alright , I will come and help you ! Let 's go ! Hurry and mount behind me ! Hand Beam ! Spin Saucer ! Melt Shower ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Damn you saucer beast ! Dizer Kick ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Oh , they have the substance . Think more , there must be a way ! One unit must be changed positively , and the other one charged negatively , alright ! Hand Beam ! Double Harken ! Space Thunder ! Anti-Vegatron radioactivity . Reduces the pain temporarily . However , full recovery requires research on Earth . I don 't expect to live till this red Eschar reaches my heart . Daisuke ! But I 've got time till then . I will perform my duties until the last breath . UFO . UFO . The food is ready , let 's eat now . I am hungry , I can 't work without a full stomach . Let 's hurry , Boss hurry let 's eat . Alright , I am coming now to eat . STOP ! What is wrong Boss ? You forgot what we have to do before and after we eat ? No I haven 't forgot it . Let us see . How are you Boss ? I want you to come over here in the holiday weekend and I wish to see you soon I lost TFO in the battle field yesterday . Come as fast as you can please . I will be waiting you . What monster have faced Kouji ? ! Boss , don 't cry please . Let 's finish our flying saucer . Boss , Kouji will be happy when he see it , we will use Boss Borot to go there and he will be ... Mucha , sure it is a special design of a special people who have great minds ! And now let us eat ! Kouji , wait for us ! UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Thirty One . A New Friendship with Boss . We 'll finish the work tomorrow morning . I 'd like to see Kouji happy face with it . I am ready to exert efforts and to remain until the end for Kouji , Boss . Excellent work you two ! Okay . Skull Moon Base , Skull Moon Base . I am X2 , answer immediately ! What are you saying ? You found a workshop run by three of Kouji Kabuto 's friends ? Yes . And they are building a strange robot . They said they will give it to Kouji Kabuto . Alright , monitor and locate his place . Yes , Sir ! We will locate Kouji Kabuto and Duke Fleed and discover their hiding place and we will know more about that robot . I will send the saucer beast to Earth just in case . I want you to destroy it before you need the saucer . The Saucer Beast Rye Rye , get ready to work . Yes , Sir ! Saucer Beast Rye Rye , get to work ! We 're going to perform a flight test ! Hey , both of you , are you ready ? Yes ! Alright , let 's go , Boss Spazer , Switch Set On ! Spazer , launch ! We did it , let 's go , hurry ! Borot JUMP ! How amazing this is ! We did it finally ! Damn ... I forgot to push the stop button ! We are falling ! In any case , the experiment was a success . Nuke , Mucha , get off now . I will take this robot to Kouji now . - Alright . - Alright . Saucer Beast Rye Rye , Saucer Beast Rye Rye . It 's not wise to give the robot to Kouji Kabuto . He thinks it 's another Grendizer . Hurry ! Roger ! Uncle , haven 't you seen Boss Borot coming yet ? Huh ? Not yet , Kouji ! I see , the time has come for Boss Borot to arrive here now . Hello , Kouji ! Hi , four colored flag . You came quickly , eh ? I heard that Boss is coming . It 's a great occasion . Spend a good time with him . Boss has a very short temper . Don 't worry , when I am bored I am at my best . You said it ! Back to our issue , Boss is very late . In the days of childhood in the past years ... I registered with my friend on a wooden pole both of our heights so that I know which one of us is taller in the future ! Kouji , wait for me , don 't get bored . You are a commander for all three of us . That is a UFO ! It is UFO ! A UFO is coming ! An awful UFO is coming toward us ! A UFO is attacking us ! UFO is coming ! Uncle , where is that UFO ? Don 't marvel , I said get ready for the battle or we lose it ! An awful UFO is coming to attack us . A very strong one . That is ? What are you all doing ? Get ready to work ! Huh ? Damn you ! Wait , Uncle . I am the head of the Earth Protection from UFO invasions Association , and you will see how my gun works , take that ! Help me ! Don 't shot me , it is me ! It is me ! Look ! Kouji Kabuto , I haven 't seen you for a long time ! Boss ! Is that you ? I will be with you . Borot , go ! Oh I fall down .

Professor , a saucer is approaching Japan , it 's UFO ! What ? Are you saying UFO ? Hayashi , prepare the telescope . Yes , Sir ! What disgrace ! I pointed my gun towards our guest , sorry ! I am Danbi Makiba and I am sorry . No problem , Danbi , no problem . I am shy from you . Boss what is your opinion of the robot ? I want you to use Boss Borot for a bit . I rebuilt it . Use it without reservation , eh ? Do you really mean it ? Do you mean it ? You are unusually reserved . What 's the matter , Kouji ? I see you are crying . No , my eyes are hurting me . I think Kouji is happy to meet his friend . Daisuke , Uncle wants you at the Research Center right away ! Alright , I will go right away . It is in the center just like in the picture . Don 't say that they have winds over there . Things won 't proceed until Daisuke 's arrival to confront them . Daisuke ! Father , it is the Allied Vegan Forces ! A saucer beast is on its way to our Research Center . Alright , I am going . We still have 10 kilometers ahead of us to reach our point . Alright ! Attention , all Minifo , attack point B-103 : 2-16 . Duke Fleed ! Grendizer Go ! Hey ! The UFO saucers are coming ! The UFO saucers are coming ! What ? ! Damn , they arrived ! Hey , Kouji , shall we strike them ? Alright ! He ... Hey ! Hey. let me join you ! HEY ! Oh ... where did they escaped to ? Father ! The UFO saucers disappeared ! There is no surprise in that .

I am ready for that ! Thank you . Boss ... Boss , I will see you again . ... where to , my friend ? Dizer Jump . Spazer Cross . Hey , Kouji ! Where does he go ? In reality , he moves from one place to another throughout the world , as if he is a bird moving through the seasons to maintain the Earth 's greenery and splendor . I understood . He is truly a kind man . Yes . Good luck ! I will see you AGAIN ! UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Thirty Two . Rebellion against the Mother . We will arrive at Tokyo Airport shortly . According to schedule . Watch the flight gage . Alright . The route and altitude are normal . Alright , flying in a day like this is enjoyable . Correct , and it is as if we are in a boat sailing at a calm bay . By the way captain , we are going to celebrate my wife 's birthday tonight . We have a party and I want you to be with us . What is that ? ! What is that over there ? ! Where ? Look over there ! Flying fish ! Look , the ignorant Earthlings are in a state of confusion . No one figured out that it is a mirage . No surprise , for the Earthlings think that no mirage appears at this altitude . Then our test was a complete success . Switch off the mirage generator . Yes , Sir ! Why did you turn it off ? Why don 't we strike the plane ? I don 't want to reveal our plan and let Duke Fleed notice that . The test succeeded now . Let 's equip the saucer beast with the mirage generator and one of the commandos will accompany the saucer . That 's what I decided already . What ? Open the door ! Yes , Sir ! Huh ? Look at her ! A duplicate copy of the Queen of Fleed . It is for this reason we selected . She is the Commando Marianne . And what is your plan to bring down Duke Fleed ? He is fierce as you know . Try . Use your assistant and you will see the result . Alright ! Attack Marianne , I don 't care even if you killed her . Yes , Sir ! The ring on Marianne 's finger is vibrant with proton , do you see ? Everything that touches the beam crumbles and Duke Fleed is no exception to that . I understood , let 's leave everything to Marianne . Stop ! I said stop , Goro ! - I said stop ! - No , no , I don 't want to , don 't want to . Oh , Daisuke , help me ! GORO ! I will pinch you now ! What 's the matter , Uncle ? I will make him abandon his succumbing behavior . Goro , come here . I don 't want . This is it ? What is that ? It is the picture of my late mother . Goro drew her , yes . My teacher requested of me to draw a picture of my mom or dad . And I present it to her now . You should have drawn me ! I don 't see a reason for you to draw a picture of your mom in particular ! Goro , stop , ... Father , stop your childish behavior ! Stop , Uncle . Stop . Hikaru ! Come here . What you are doing ? Leave me ! Listen to me well . You should take it with you to school , Goro . Thank you , Daisuke . What 's the matter ? Come on smile . Uncle won 't get mad at you . No problem here . The picture does not look like my mother at all . That is not encouraging . It 's not finished yet , that 's the reason . But I ... I will tell you . Concentrate on the picture of your mother with all your effort . And when you draw her well , don 't leave the matter half done , get me ? I will try completing it in art class . Alright , hurry to your school or else you will be late . Until we meet again . I am coming ! What is it , Father ? This is Daisuke . What happened , Father ? A saucer beast is approaching and its target may be the Research Center ! Why you 've done that ? I will kill you ! We will finish now . If the nuclear device is used in this weapon it will be a destructive one . Ops ! It 's coming ! It 's not complete yet ? When we put this in its place everything will be complete . Then hurry , let 's go ! Duke Fleed ! Route 5 is prepared for launch . The sky is now covered with clouds and they won 't discover us with their radars . Alright , Daisuke , Route 5 . I understood , Route 5 . Grendizer Go ! It is Grendizer . Commando Marianne , get to work immediately , you have to success . I got that . That is you , saucer beast . Spin Saucer ! Spin Saucer ! What is it , Daisuke ? The saucer beast disappeared like heat fog . Heat fog ? Alright , I will analyze the observation papers now . Be ready and don 't be hasty . Yes . Huh ? It returned again ! Spin Drill ! Huh ? What an incident ! What is all of this ? Missile , Go ! It came from behind me before I saw it ! Alright ! Everything is against me . Move ! Daisuke , hide in the clouds temporarily ! Alright ! Alright , it looks like I missed the enemy , but something makes me wonder ... I will try again , Go ! It 's the town of Fleed ! Funny ! How do I see Fleed 's town on this land ? Huh ? What is this now ? I smell a trick ! Alright , I will see what the game is ! Alright ! It seems like a ghost town . Duke Fleed ... Duke Fleed ... Who are you ? What is the idea of disguise with my mother 's face ? How do you speak with your mother this way ? Duke Fleed don 't say that you forgot me . You lie ! My mother died in the attack of the United Vegan Forces . Know this ! You are right . It is correct that the United Vegan Forces killed me . However , I was saved by the favor of the sciences of the inhabitants of Planet Vega . I don 't believe it . Then come and touch me . This neither a dream nor an illusion . Come , Duke Fleed . Come , Duke Fleed . Come ... Oh , Professor , the electronic analysis result has arrived . It seems like some sort of mirage . What ? Then , let 's tell Daisuke about it immediately ! Daisuke ! Answer me . There is no use of doing that , Professor . Powerful electric waves are emanating from Grendizer 's location . Maybe they are special waves that the mirage generator transmitted . Alright , I will take the Jeep and hurry ! Riding the Jeep is dangerous ! I will take the Cyclone gun with me ; a good opportunity to test it out ! Kouji ! What is the reason for this pain ? Damn ! What an affliction ! Why does it hurt me suddenly ? Maybe it 's her ... Duke Fleed ... Don 't come near ! You revealed your true color . Don 't deceive me ! Your body is releasing protonic energy ! That 's not right ! Listen ! On my arm is an old wound from a protonic bomb on Planet Fleed ! Take a look . My wound is affected and hurts when it gets close to protonic energy . But that is ... Tell me who you are ! Why did you disguise yourself in my mother 's face ? I knew that from this wound . You are not my mother ! You are not my mother ! No , this is from what 's left over from the energy used to bring me back to life . Shut up ! You are an infiltrator of the Allied Vegan Forces ! Duke Fleed ! Wait ! The game is over . And the town lost its case . I think that is ... Damn ! What a disaster ! The mirage generator doesn 't work ! Duke Fleed ! Then it is the trick of Allied Vegan Forces as I thought ! It is skillful of you to know that . Damn ! She disappeared ! Damn ! I have to hurry . Daisuke , please remain safe . What is the matter , Marianne ? The mirage generator was completely destroyed . What ? Do you think that the advanced weapon was destroyed now ? I am sorry , but I will sacrifice my life to defeat Grendizer , don 't worry . The only way is for you to use the proton flame bomb . Your victory is a must ! Yes , Sir . Damn you , Duke Fleed ! Your life will expire immediately ! Daisuke , Kouji is coming to you so make sure no harm afflicts him . Roger that ! Alright ! Dizer Go ! Damn you ! Spin Saucer ! Damn you ! Hmm , you will see the work of the proton flame bomb . Be careful , Daisuke ! The flame bomb emits proton beams ! Damn ! Daisuke , even if the flame bomb misses you and passes near you it makes your wound worse with its beams , be careful then ! I understood . Separate Spazer and attack from both sides ! I will try . Alright . Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Double Harken ! Spin Saucer ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Damn you ! The proton bomb that is situated in the head will accompany Duke Fleed to hell ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! You will not escape from me . Damn ! Melt Shower ! My arm ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ! Feel pain . Feel pain until you reach hell ! Damn ! Daisuke , get a hold of yourself , Daisuke ! Use the Space Thunder ; it breaks the proton beams in the flame bomb when you use Space Thunder ! Daisuke , release the button , hurry ! My arm ... Damn ! Daisuke , rise ! Get up , Daisuke ! Marianne , attack now ! Attack Duke Fleed , and break him up with Grendizer ! Yes , Sir ! I will ram him and show him the power of the proton bomb . Get ready , Duke Fleed ! What are you doing , Daisuke ? Cyclone Beam ! I did it ! I did it , it was successful ! Daisuke ! Are you alright ? Daisuke ! Daisuke , are you alright ? ! Come immediately so we can treat your wound ! Alright ... Damn ... Daisuke ! Daisuke , are you alright ? Kouji ! Are you alright , Daisuke ? Yes ... Did you destroy the beast for me , Kouji ? No problem . How is your wound , Daisuke ? It hurts me a little . Hurry home so we can treat it , let 's go ! By the way , how did you succeed in destroying the enemy , Kouji ? It is the Cyclone gun ! I want you to see it at a later time . See you ! Grendizer Go ! Daisuke ! Hey Goro , come ! My teacher congratulated me and was impressed with my drawing , look ! Oh ... it is complete , a beautiful drawing ! It looks like our mother a lot ! I will show it to Father , but I don 't know if he will take it . Of course he will like it , I am sure of that . He will undoubtedly like it . Really ? I hope so ! And now , Goro ! Mother ... Yes ... I am confident that I like her so much . UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Thirty Three . Death of a New Weapon . Let 's go ! A good horse ; I trained it with utmost care . An excellent horse and its rider is excellent . Indeed . Come on . Let 's go ! Daisuke , you look magnificent ! What is Daisuke ? Daisuke looks better because the horse is magnificent , as it is a strong horse . Daisuke ! Pull the bridle tighter to get a boost ! Move . Daisuke ! Didn 't I tell you to pull tighter ? I am sorry . What 's wrong with you Daisuke ? Why did you try to stop suddenly ? You tried to act skillful . No wonder you fell ; you pulled the bridle suddenly and you fell . Eh ? You don 't comprehend . Idiot , do you hear me ? So you were trying to avoid running over the injured bird , Daisuke . That 's amazing . What A bird ? It is an ordinary bird . Where did you find the bird ? What do you mean by that , Father ? Answer me ! The bird is ... Answer me ! Daisuke wanted to save the poor bird . So the horse stumbled and made him fall . Despite leaving his company , he tried to save him , but he couldn 't . Despite his tenderness , you called him an idiot . Goro , calm down . Father , please apologize to Daisuke . Ah , in brief ... I mean ... I mean ... Father , you told me that correcting the mistake shouldn 't come late , come on ! I understood , Goro . I admit that I erred . Sorry , Daisuke ! Don 't worry , I should 've found the bird earlier so that I wouldn 't have startled the horse to fall . Here you go . I felt relieved for the bird 's safety . I hope it recovers . If we treat it , then the wound will heal . Alright , we will . Hurry so we can treat the wound ! Let 's go Goro . You know Goro ... When you fell ... You were wounded ? Ah no , this is an old wound . Look , don 't be scared . Daisuke ... The wound is spreading gradually as if it is a curse . Don 't worry , Father . I know that , but I don 't feel pain , thanks to the healing device . The device calms the pain but doesn 't stop its spread . If the wound was inflicted by Vegatron , then it will spread to the chest . It 's threatening your life , Daisuke . Be careful ! I will live my life until that time , Father . Daisuke ... I have lots of time to complete my mission as long as I am alive . What happened , Father ? Take a look at this ! It 's a Minifo formation ! Damn ! If my saucer was completed now , I would 've defeated them with the Cyclone gun , but what benefit comes from wishing ? A saucer beast may come after them . Daisuke , get ready . Yes , I understood . Be careful , Daisuke ! Duke Fleed ' . ! Grendizer Go ! You came , Minifo ? Melt Shower ! Hand Beam ! Grendizer must have a weak point . It must be reached . It must be reached . Hand Beam ! Space Thunder ! Hand Beam ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Double Harken ! I won 't let them go ! Dizer Jump ! He has weak points . Spazer Go ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! Spin Drill ! Spin Saucer ! I know his weak points ! Focus on Grendizer 's weak points . It is the Grendizer ! A great success ! Alright , I don 't have time to waste . I will finish my new saucer and quickly ! I struck all units of the Minifo . I see . Be careful and return now . Roger that . No space saucers have appeared yet . There 's nothing new about their attack despite what they gather of power . It seems like it all came to be destroyed , so what 's the reason ? In truth , I don 't know , but I think it was an ordinary fight . I think so . And I fear there is going to be an attack . So what is the intent ? Daisuke , are you in pain ? No , every time I put my hand on the wound I feel the power to fight them . This is true . Daisuke ... Minster Zuril ! Why did you take your own special way ? It 's a disgrace for the computer mind to plan our operations ! Know that the computer mind is perfect ! What you are saying ? An entire squad of Minifo was destroyed without benefit ! It did not destroyed without an aim . Without an aim ? You decided to sacrifice the entire squad from the start ! Correct ! I won 't forgive you ! Why did you do that ? Huh ? Your answer will determining if I should inform the Great Vega . Defeating Grendizer . I see , and what was the result ? Could you tell me ? Look . Grendizer jumps to a height of 350 meters only . Grendizer cannot fly . He must unites with Spazer to fly . His ascension takes six minutes . This is what I wanted . We understand Grendizer 's two weak points . If we can strike them , then we will defeat Grendizer ! And what is the plan to strike him ? I will use Zari Zari from Planet Zari . Zari Zari from Planet Zari ? That weapon ? This is Zari Zari . It came to us right after we attacked Zari Zari 's planet . That 's correct , although all living creatures on Zari Zari 's planet died ; Zari Zari was the sole survivor . But it evolved to this huge figure after it was affected by the radiation of Vegatron . So Zari Zari developed and became huge and evil and Zari 's gravity surpasses Earth 's by 13 times . It works at a super speed on Earth . Space Saucer Zari Zari is the only weapon to confront Grendizer . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ! What happened ? The bird ... the bird ... We treated its wound , but the bird has weakened and could die . No ... That isn 't correct , not correct ! Isn 't that so , Daisuke ? Daisuke , say that this is not correct , say it ! Daisuke ! Alright , I have an idea of a healing treatment . Let 's go the Research Center . Thank you , Uncle . Thank you , Daisuke . Thank you , Uncle . Good bye . Father ... Will you do that for me ? Daisuke ... Amazing . I feel relieved . And me too . Wait me , Goro ! Daisuke ... I struggle ... I struggle so that I don 't feel this pain again , I must finish my mission . Frightening speed ! Pro ... Professor , saucer is coming at a monstrous speed ! What ? It 's entering the atmosphere ! Duke Fleed ' . ! Grendizer Go ! You came , Saucer Beast ! Spin Drill ! Melt Shower ! Spin Saucer ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Double Harken ! Dizer Jump ! Damn ! Spazer Go ! Dizer Jump ! Well done ! Well done , saucer beast Zari Zari ! If Grendizer was killed , then we are able to overcome the Earth ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ! Answer me ! Daisuke ... Damn ! What an incident , I will avenge for Daisuke ! What a monstrous saucer beast ! I will use the Cyclone gun to destroy it . Hey , Kouji ! Wait , wait , wait ! I am coming with you to fight ! Daisuke , answer me ! Daisuke ! I saw a monstrous saucer beast somewhere . Daisuke ... Daisuke ... Answer me ! Fa ... Father ! Are you alright ? I overcame the crisis with a simulated explosion ... Daisuke ! Cheer up , Daisuke . Daisuke , get a hold of yourself ! Cheer up , Daisuke ; you will never be beaten with such things . The wounded bird fully recovered so brighten up , Daisuke , brighten up ! The bird ... the bird ... That 's right ; I remembered the monstrous saucer beast , that 's it ! Zari Zari ... It was our pet bird in my childhood , and I didn 't know that Zari Zari was the space saucer beast ! I remember , The United Vegan Forces destroyed Planet Zari . Zari Zari became huge due to the radiation reaction ; I must remember that it 's a monstrous saucer beast ! Poor Zari Zari . Finally I came to help you ! Oh , Uncle Danbi ! Listen ! I am Makiba Danbi from the farm ! Come and let 's fight in an honorable battle ! What you are saying ? Uncle , we can only withdraw , let 's go ! ... What ? Escape in front of the enemy ? Don 't follow us , I will destroy you ! Ah , Grendizer ! I leave it to you ! We can only catch it off-guard to overcome it . Double Harken ! It must be destroyed immediately ! Damn ! Now is the chance ! Space Thunder ! Cheer up ! Good bye . Be careful not to fall again ! I can 't believe how that monstrous saucer beast was Duke Fleed 's childhood pet bird . The radiation enlarged it and rendered it an unfaithful weapon . It is a victim , poor bird . Nobody knows , maybe this bird will face the same fate . These are things we shouldn 't neglect in life . UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Thirty Four . Teardrop of the Wolf . Commander Goss is coming . Come to defeat Duke Fleed over our heads . Assigned by the Great Vega and we must respect him . We are late , look out . Commander Goss will not see you . Oh ... What ? Commander Goss is in the records room . Commander Goss . We went to meet him and we came . What do you mean by that ? I came to take information about Duke Fleed . I didn 't come to exchange salutations with you ! Wait ! I am the leader of Skull Moon Base ; if you are an officer , then act according to what befits you . Nonsense ! Why don 't you leave these old habits ? You will waste time before beating the kid . You are offending my pride ! Calm down , calm down , Gandal . I am indebted to your well being with me life . A high-spirited youth . Shut up ! I will not forgive him ! I will punish him with the saucer beast Gom Gom . Wait ! His saucer beast is more powerful than yours ! What ? Oh my God , amazing ! Great Vega ! He is qualified . An impolite monster . There is no escape from that . Goss is from the elite of the Wolf Planet . Wolf Planet ? Correct , for he is impolite . The Wolf Planet is rocky ; no trees or grass . And what is with that ? I have promised him the freedom of the Wolf Planet . That is , if he killed Duke Fleed in three days and for that he is fiery , and I am sure of his victory . It is not possible to kill him in three days . The man of the Wolf Planet , when the moon is full , becomes as strong as a wolf , and after three days , the moon will become full . Terrible , he loves destruction . The entire city will burn if he continues like that . I will go now ! Daisuke ! It is a plan to draw Grendizer , be careful ! Duke Fleed ! Grendizer Go ! Here you are ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! You are Duke Fleed ? Yes , I am . I am Goss . From the Wolf Planet . For your life our Planet gains its freedom . Therefore , know that I will kill you for my life ! Duke Fleed , get ready to fight ! His attacks are fast and can 't be seen ! I will kick you now ! Screw Crusher ! Duke Fleed , it is dangerous , withdraw in any way . The enemy is striking hard . Try to attack him , Duke Fleed ! Shoulder Boomerang ! When the moon is full , your life expires ; I mean tomorrow . When the moon is full ? Our planet was conquered by surprise on the night of the full moon . I will turn the time of our defeat into a victory ! Go now ! Hurry up and leave immediately ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! An inhuman move ; it is a move of a wolf ! A move of wolf ! Ah , Father ! Daisuke . Strange , why did he let you go ? He said he will kill me when the moon is full ! When the moon is full ? That means tomorrow ! Yes . I will make an action plan for that . But ... Don 't worry . I will not be killed easily . A terrible enemy ... Father ! Please , don 't distance yourself and help me ! I strive to discover a UFO saucer and bring it down . Don 't interfere with my business . Take that ! What are you doing ? No matter , you understand now . Who ? Who is that ? A horseman is coming ! He resembles me when I used to be in the pastures . Pardon , I would like to quench my horse 's thirst . From here please . You are a traveler ? Where are you heading to , eh ? Yes , I am a traveler and I am pursuing the enemy . You want to avenge ? What 's the name of the enemy ? Duke Fleed . What ? A wolf-man from the star ? He said that the name of his enemy is Duke Fleed . It is Goss , he will observe me until the moon is full . Nonsense , I will eliminate him right away . He sure is a rider to be able to control a stubborn horse . Why don 't you carry a gun with you ? It seems like you are a real cowboy ! Are you the wolf-man ? Speak ! What do you want from me , kid ? You say I am kid , you stupid ? Hey , Kouji ! What inflicted you ? What ? ! Uncle , Danbi ! Take his to the Research Center . Alright . Kouji , keep yourself together ! I want to tell you something . Goss , it is me who you want to kill . Don 't hurt anyone except me . You were not able to defeat me with the machines ; you want to fight me on equivalent terms . Come on . You said that the Wolf Planet will be freed if you kill me ? Do you think that Great Vega fulfills his promise ? I lived with the wolves in the rocky mountains and learned their moves . All that to defeat you and to free the Wolf Planet . Take the knife and let 's fight ! Stop it ! Hikaru , get away . His heart is from rock ! No , I won 't do it . I won 't allow such a man to kill Duke Fleed . Fine . Tomorrow the moon becomes full , and your life will end . How do I win ? What should I do ? The horse strayed , come and help me . Are you going to fight Duke Fleed ? Yes , I am waiting for tonight . Don 't kill Duke Fleed , if you do , then the Vegans will invade the Earth . That doesn 't concern me . Where 's the horse ? There is no trace of horses . Don 't lose your sense ! Do what I requested of you or else ... You will shoot me ? Yes , I will shoot you ! You tricked me ! Hikaru ! I want to duel with you ; if I win I will cut the rope . Why did he save my life ? He behaved with the inspiration of his manners ; that is Duke Fleed . He saved you even though you intended to kill him . Brother ! I have a lot of flowers , look ! Don 't you see ? The flowers are blossoming on the Wolf Planet . Brother ... Ronan ! Since that time , the Wolf Planet has become a wreck , filled with rocks , and with neither flowers nor grass . Who took the flowers of my homeland ? Who turned my homeland into a Planet of rocks ? It is Great Vega ! I forgot the most important thing , and I intend to become stronger and stronger ! The Great Vega wiped out the flowers from the Wolf Planet ! I wipe out the flowers from the Earth ? ! Commander Goss , listen ! The moon is full tonight ; you have to kill Duke Fleed . We have adopted a wise plan ; we sent a squad of Minifo and a huge saucer beast to back you up . Time has come ! Professor , a huge squad is coming ! Grendizer Go ! Duke Fleed ! Spin Saucer ! Spin Drill ! Melt Shower ! Why do you back me up ? ! Don 't misunderstand me ; I wanted to kill you myself . Let 's go ! Alright ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! You expect to defeat me in the light of the full moon ? Space Thunder ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Hand Beam ! Hand Beam ! Now I understood another matter ... Shoulder Boomerang ! Goss , you are surrendering on purpose . Idiot ! You did not fight me , even though you were eager to kill me . Everything ended ... Everything ended on the best condition . Brother ... Ronan ! Ronan ! Goss ... You love flowers , isn 't that so ? You wanted the flowers to increase on Earth . That is true you loved flowers . Goss , I understand now and I promise you that as long as I am alive , I will fight so that life remains on Earth . Ah , a shooting star ! UFO . UFO . How wonderful fishing is today how wonderful fishing is ! What is that ? Alright ! I have to get closer . ... Saucer Beast ! I ... I ... I must inform them ! UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Thirty Five . Flying in Space with Double Spazer . Father , we were just informed that nothing is wrong at all . I see . Maybe it was a meteor just as we assumed . Maybe . This is Commander Beto , this is Commander Beto . I succeeded in infiltrating Earth securely . Alright ! Well done . May Grendizer perish ! He must think that the flying saucer only comes from space . That is above his perception . We will take him out of the Earth this time . Alright . Listen ! Don 't surface on the ground until you reach your final destination . This is an aerial view of the area and its surroundings , from where Grendizer is believed to launch , and the computer scrutinized it . We believe that there is something important around the red light . So we have to scan and search the whole area . Your mission is to drill into the ground , find Grendizer 's base and destroy it . Leave the matter to me , I am skillful in the ground , I am sure I will succeed ! I wish success for you . I think Grendizer will be incapable this time . Hey Kouji , are you done ? Yes , all I have left is to wait for test flight day . It looks like a fighting jet . How do you plan to use it in space ? Tell me ! The first priority is conquering space beasts . Wait , wait ! My mission is to fight the saucer beast , don 't forget that ! I don 't think so . It doesn 't mean fighting them like you do , and plus you will return to Planet Fleed one day , Daisuke ? You can leave the matter of the Earth to me . What are you saying , Kouji ? Daisuke ! Don 't you two differ on something simple . I am sorry . When it is completed , you two will complete . That is imaginable . By the way , did you get the milk ? Ah , yes . That pleases me , because I am hungry . Me too . Hmm , you two agree when you talk about food . Huh , that 's correct ! Professor ! Professor ! What 's the matter ? An obscure quake was registered on the radar . What ? An obscure quake ? Professor ! The quake is slowly getting closer . What ? It 's very strange that the quake is moving , eh ? Saeki , watch its path on the computer . Alright , I will do . Its path leads to the coastal village . To the village ? I understand , I think that a saucer beast was on Earth all along . Then what fell in the village wasn 't a meteor after all . I think it is the saucer beast . Maybe , everything is possible . Huh ? It headed towards the school ! Eh ? Goro and his friends are playing over there ! What if the school is demolished , Daisuke ? What if it is ? ! Yes . Duke Fleed ! Grendizer , Standby Okay ! Alright , get ready to move . All the routes are monitored . Alright , aim a disturbing wave over Route 4 . Yes , Sir ! Daisuke , Route 4 is clear . But since it is being monitored don 't ascend into the air yet . Roger that . Router 4 , Gate Open . Grendizer , Go ! Passing through Hell Valley ! Stop ... Stop ! Father ! Father ! Shut up ! I want to sleep ! You are an annoying girl ! Something bad is happening ! Goro and his friends are being attacked by the saucer beast What ? ! Goro Makiba , the heir of the farm , is in danger ! Something must be done ! Alright , I am going ... What ? ! Why ... ! Father ! Are you alright ? Something this small cannot beat me you know . Let 's go ! Move now ! Delivered . An earthquake ! Everyone calm down ! Danger ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! It is dangerous here ! Get away immediately ! Let 's run away now . Dizer Jump ! Screw Crusher ! From this way , hurry ! Goro ! Daddy ! - Stop , stop now . - Daddy ! - Thanks God you are alright . Father ! Hurry , the saucer beast may return ! Come on , quickly ! What ? The saucer beast ? Where is it ? The saucer beast is under the ground ! IDIOT ! How can a saucer beast fly in the ground ? Alright , I found it ! Wait ! Damn , I let him to get away ! No way , Spazer isn 't finished from testing yet . It 's hard to work with it as a team because it is in the sky and I am on the ground . I am afraid that the enemy will skillfully detect Grendizer 's weak point . Anyway , get it before it attacks again ! Yes . Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! Dizer Go ! What a lightsome saucer . Hurry and come , Spazer ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! Damn ! I lost the saucer beast ! Come on , go ! Ah , another quake ! - What happened ? Anyone tells me ! - It is the saucer beast ! - I don 't believe it , that is stupid ... - Look over there ! Daddy ! I passed away ... Hang on ! Let 's be careful ! Help us ! Anyone help us ! Wait , Beto ! You are outside your course ! No , I am not out of my course . Your devices are in error ! What ? The enemy must have disrupted all the devices for sure ! Do you mean that what we have found is incorrect ? Exactly , I know everything about the ground , did you forget that ? Wait , there might be a trap . I will scrutinize with the computer . Will do . It stopped ! It is time to head to the Research Center ! - Alright ... Goro , hurry ! ' Yes ! Don 't stop ! How does it look like ? Hmm , just as Beto said . There is an error with the longitude line . It is not due to an error in measurements , a disruptive wave was emitted from somewhere . Beto , what you said is correct . Do whatever you like ! Alright , I will do . Professor , the saucer beast is headed towards the launch gate of Route 5 ! What ? Daisuke ! The gate of Route 5 is in danger . Head over there immediately ! Roger that . Dizer Full Power ! Hayashi , will Grendizer make it on time ? I think so , but I fear it will not conquer the enemy ... Alright , be prepared for an explosion . Pro ... Professor ! I think it is better to have it destroyed far over there , rather than letting the saucer beast attack us . But , if we destroy Route 5 , then the lake will be flooded and the barn will completely drown . There is no help for it . It will be dangerous if the enemy discovers Grendizer 's secret routes . The secret must be preserved at any cost ! Yes . I understand that . I will turn off the radar . Pull the explosion device on my command . Yes . The top light is Grendizer and the lower one is the saucer beast . I hope that you can make it in time , Daisuke ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Screw Crusher ! Get ready to detonate Route 5 ! Wait ! Damn you ! Even through the distance was only 500 meters away ! Alright , I shall fire to decrease the oxygen level . Fire ! The oxygen level is decreasing suddenly . Alright ! Screw Punch ! Wait ! Land mines launch ! I succeeded ! If it comes out of the ground , then it is a demon and not a machine ! Spazer Go ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! Double Harken ! It is headed towards the Science Space Center ! Spazer Go ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! Father ! The saucer beast is heading towards the Science Space Center ! It lost control of itself since its head was cut off . Be cautious ! Alright , we got that . Listen , everyone ! Everyone head to the underground shelter ! You must evacuate the area ! You must evacuate the area ! Professor ... Oh , Dank ) " ! You are alright , Goro ? I am glad ! The saucer beast is coming , hurry up and hide . Professor , I will go to defeat the saucer beast . Wait , Kouji ! Don 't go , it hasn 't flied yet . But , Professor ... Don 't go until you receive instruction ! Alright , I will wait . Darn it ! I can 't move . Damn ! Huh ? Over there ! Hand Beam ! No ! The Space Science Center will be completely blasted if I follow up the attack on the beast ! Father , I can 't ! There is no use ! I can 't follow up with the attack ! Send Spazer in the air and return the saucer beast to its place . If that is done then Grendizer won 't be able to fly ! Let 's try it ! Yes . Kouji ! Kouji , Standby to launch ! Yes , Professor . Standby Okay ! DAMN YOU ! Dizer Go ! Father , I succeeded in the segregation operation . Alright , attack it before it gets far ! Yes . Double Spazer Go ! Kouji ! Hold on to me , we can 't let him get far away . Alright ! Dizer Jump ! My first trip with a brother , let 's go ! Damn it ! Spazer Out ! Space Thunder ! Screw Punch ! Daisuke , I shall give it the final hit ! Alright , execute your Double Spazer first operation . Alright ! Double Cutter ! We succeeded ! Well done , Kouji . Damn ! I thought we succeeded ! They have a new weapon that we must overcome , we must ! We must destroy them ! If we are able to unite Grendizer and Spazer , then we would achieve a magnificent saucer ! It will be a perfect UFO Robo . That is my dream ! UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Thirty Six . An Oath in Space . General Gandal , an unidentified flying object is approaching the moon ! What ? On path D-105 . Line G-106 . It is a giant meteor. if it hits this Skull Moon Base directly , then it would blast everything and leave nothing . What you are doing ? Haven 't you identified the collision point ? ! Yes . One moment , Sir ! I got it now . The point 35 , 84 . Really ? Then the collision point is Skull Moon Base . Send out the defense unit right away ! Yes . It must be destroyed at any cost before it reaches the moon ! Most meteors that fall towards the Earth end up burning simply by passing through the atmosphere because of the friction with the air . But the meteors that fall on the moon are shattered on its surface because the moon has no atmosphere . It can 't be ! General Gandal . Use the gravity beam . With that beam , you are able to alter the meteor 's collision point . Alright , I will fire the beam myself . Turn on the key ! Yes , Sir ! And what if the gravity beam doesn 't work ? There won 't be any measures after that ... Beam , launch ! It 's no use ! The gravity beam has no effect either ! The game is over ! Everybody escape immediately ! General Gandal , wait ! There 's no need for that . What is that emblem ? The emblem of the bodyguard of Great Vega ! Skull Moon Base was saved ! Moreover ... The ability of the Vegan bodyguard on the work was tremendous ! The bodyguard of Great Vega ... That scary guard is returning to this Earth ? Daisuke ! Don 't surprise me like that ! What are you thinking about , Daisuke ? Eh ? Nothing at all ... Hikaru , are you thinking about anything ? Uncle Umon needs you for an important matter . He is waiting for you at The Space Science Center right away . For an important matter ? Alright , I will come back to you , Sliver , to wash you after I finish from the work . Let 's go . Move . Commander Zegra . Is here by order of the Great Vega . Alright , come forward . Commander Zegra , let me compliment your undertaking . Lay off with the courtesies , I hate this type of praise , do you know what I mean ? Tell me what your mission is after you came here to Skull Moon Base . My mission is to smash Grendizer . The fighting spirit always moves within me every time I face a strong foe ! Are you really able to defeat Grendizer as you say ? Most probably . That will be splendid , Commander Zegra ! Explain to me your plan . I will explain to you my plan . Briefly , one must take advantage of the enemy 's weakness to the utmost limit . Take advantage ? As you know , nothing in the universe is perfect . For example , that meteor , that you were helpless against , had an apparent weak point . That was a crack in the meteor . And I broadened the crack , and then fired the beam inside it . And the result is what you saw . Then , Grendizer has weak points . Of course . What ? Are you confident ? Exactly , and his weak point is fatal . It took 7.5 seconds between changing seats and ending the separation . The second is Spazer Cross . From connecting to changing seats ; 6 seconds . These seconds are the deadly period for Grendizer . Deadly period ? Grendizer becomes incapable of fighting . Then , Grendizer becomes paralyzed if the enemy attacks it . That is correct ; this weak point it can be lethal for Grendizer . Alright , and now Kouji , please run the tape for me . Yes . Now the main subject : The First Pattern . Here , Dizer Jumps . Then a Scramble Turn . Then Double Spazer approaches immediately from behind and unites together , ( A connection operation ) . The second pattern . Dizer Go ! Double Spazer approaches from behind . A connection operation . That is marvelous ! It is awesome to have Grendizer connected with Double Spazer . Father , is the connection system completed now ? You saw for yourself . After the connection that is established Grendizer is able to fly by itself . Isn 't that so ? And there is no need to change seats , plus the deadly period is avoided as well . The connection system has become complete , but before using it , a series of hard trainings must be executed . The trainings don 't bother me after the method has been established . Let 's get ready for the hard trainings , Daisuke . Kouji , are you going to go with Double Spazer ? Of course ! Do you think of anything different ? I am Kouji Kabuto , don 't forget that . Let 's go now ! Daisuke ... I know the extent of your concern for Kouji . But , Father ... If the Double Spazer connects with Grendizer , then the burden falls on it . It doesn 't concern me if I am exposed to harm , but I don 't want Kouji to get embroiled because of me . But , I don 't want Kouji to get harmed because of me , do you understand me ? Daisuke ... Daisuke , don 't cling on to such absurdities . Kouji ... I am ... Daisuke , I will tell you about the human relationship . The human relationship ? A human can 't live by himself . We have to depend on each other , if we want to realize better accomplishments , Daisuke . You possess super power . But you are still from the inhabitants of Earth . Tell me Daisuke . Do you consider yourself from the inhabitants of Planet Fleed ? You are one of us , be sure . Daisuke . Kouji is right . It is important in life that one works with others . That is what I wanted to tell you . I understand that , Father . Thank you , Kouji . I won 't forget what you said for me as long as I live . It is not my nature to deliver a lecture ; it makes me happy that my words are understood . Kouji ! To the special training ! Alright . Prepared for launch ! General Gandal , we will meet again . You are an awesome bodyguard . You discovered Grendizer 's faults . Commander Zegra , I await good news from you . No problem . Saucer beast Gera Gera , go ! Duke Fleed , surrender yourself and wait for me , Commander Zegra will show you stars in broad daylight , like no one has ever done before . I will defeat you all ! Professor , we are ready . Alright . Daisuke ... Kouji ... We will focus the connection training according to pattern 1 . Are you both ready ? Grendizer , Standby Okay . Double Spazer , Standby Okay . Alright . Hayashi , can you please mobilize the engine ? Alright , Grendizer , Switch On ! Double Spazer , Switch On ! Daisuke , get ready I am coming . Welcome to you , Kouji . Alright . Open attachment The attachment is opened ! Alright . And now Grendizer , begin the scramble turn . Roger that . Grendizer Scramble Turn . Combination Cross . Error , the timing was too fast . As well , the operation needed ten seconds from the start of the scramble turn . The time for connection with Double Spazer drop down by half this way . There must speed in the connection , thereby decreasing Grendizer 's critical time . What is important is speed and timing . Understood . Alright , let 's try again . We will succeed now ! Grendizer Scramble Turn . Combination Cross . Kouji , are you alright ? Kouji ! I am alright . Professor , let me try again . No , that is enough for today , you have tried for about five hours until now . Turn off the switch and the engines . Understood . Don 't expect good after the first try . We will try one more time tomorrow morning . What a task ! I will succeed from the first try tomorrow ; it would be a shame for me to fail . Are you alright , Kouji ? I am alright , don 't worry . Hey , Kouji ! I am alright , Daisuke . Professor , emergency situation , Professor ! What is it ? A flying saucer beast is coming by itself from the direction of the moon . A flying saucer beast is coming by itself ? Alright , I will be with you . Daisuke , take a look . What is that emblem ? Great Vega 's bodyguard ... The prediction became a reality , it became a reality ! Grendizer Go ! I am disturbed . Disturbed ? Yes , the flying saucer beast of Great Vega 's evil bodyguard is coming by itself without Minifo forces . I hope my feeling doesn 't come true . Why ... why is he sure of himself ? Those 7.5 and 6 seconds for separation and connection are deadly moments for Grendizer . Did they discover the secret ? Is that you , Vega 's Evil bodyguard ? Duke Fleed . My patience has run out with you due to your arrogant behavior ! As if you are the ruler of the universe ! For that I am going to get rid of you today and send you to hell ! Space Thunder ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Damn you ! Spin Saucer ! Melt Shower ! Space Thunder ! Duke Fleed ... My saucer body is made of Super Veganiom alloy , so your weapons , Grendizer , won 't affect it ! Damn ! It looks like I am going to convert it into a ground flight ! You are fooled easily , Duke Fleed ! Shoot In ! These necessary seconds for separation and connection are deadly moments for Grendizer ! DAMN ! Now ! TAKE THAT , GRENDIZER ! Daisuke ... Daisuke ... Pull yourself together , Daisuke ! Father ! Daisuke ! Jump now , Daisuke ! Dizer Go ! Double Spazer , Engine Start ! Kouji ! Stop now ! You didn 't succeed in the connection training yet ! You are exhausted because of the special training ! I don 't want you to exhaust yourself , Kouji ! Professor , please let me go ! The people need help ! Daisuke requires help ! Double Spacer , Go ! Kouji ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Space Thunder ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! Duke Fleed . The game is almost over ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Damn you ! Damn you ! Daisuke , do your best ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ! Daisuke ! I will now direct a finishing blow to you , Duke Fleed ! Daisuke ! Kouji ! Cyclone Beam ! Damn you ! Daisuke , this is our chance ! Let Dizer jump ! Alright ! Attachment Open ! Dizer Jump ! Daisuke try to do it now ! Try to do the Scramble Turn ! Scramble Turn ! Everything or nothing ! We must success this time ! I will pledge my life with one chance ! Combination Cross ! We did it ! We succeeded , Daisuke ! Kouji ! Eh ... What is all this racket ? Space Thunder ! Cyclone Beam ! Damn you ! Now is our chance , Kouji ! Aim at the saucer beasts opening ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Double Cutter ! How stupid I was ! I never dreamt that they would discover the weak point . Father , Kouji , I think that I now understand the importance of a human helping each other . Correct . There is no life without the pulling strength of the firm bond of teamwork . UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Thirty Seven . Connect Your Life with Wings . It looks like I am finished . Fantastic , Father ! Sure it is fantastic . Uncle , I finished assembling the fence . Thank you . Ah , by the way , what are you doing , Uncle ? What is that ? Don 't know what this is ? Fine , I will tell you ! A machine gun constructed by Danbi , did you understand ? Huh ? You say it is a historical machine gun ? Ah , I understood . Therefore , it seems old as I believe , isn 't that right ? Stupid ! What are you talking about ? It 's true that it seems old , but it can 't be challenged in terms of ability . Daisuke , first of all , this machine .. .. leave me alone ! And now , let 's b begin training , Goro . Take on the role of a saucer beast ! A saucer beast ! Right , pretend you are a saucer beast . And now , let 's go ! No ! Leave me alone ! Don 't approach me ! You are going to kill me like that ... Father ! Hey ! Stop , you filthy ! STOP Hikaru ! Oh , what is that ? Father , why you are running after Goro like this ? Remember that you are old enough to do that . My lovely Hikaru . Eh ... What ... You never been so beautiful like now ... But what ... Sister I never knew that you are so beautiful like this . I am so beautiful , you are such a stupid to notice that I am very beautiful now , Goro . NO WAY ! I don 't like that ! Hikaru , what do you mean with dressing such a short skirt ! Don 't you see that it is short ? From where did you buy it ? From wh ... I will hang him from his neck ... Father ! You are stubborn ! Who is the one decided the skirt long ! Tell me ! I don 't care ! I don 't like it , I can 't accept it ! Father , please let me wear it . I will see what is Daisuke 's opinion about it ... huh ? ! What is that ? Ah , it is an urgent call from the Great Vega . What ? An urgent call from the Great Vega ? Oh , the Great Vega ! Listen to me . A dangerous situation that requires attention has occurred . A dangerous situation ? A black hole swallowed the Vegatron Star that used to supply us with energy and turned it off . And thus , we have no energy . The Vegatron Star ! The Vegatron Star that is on the screen ? That 's right . The Mighty Star carries huge amounts of energy beyond all imagination our scientific powers are helpless without its energy . What are we going to do about energy from now on ? We will be without energy after a very short while ! What we should do ? Our matter will be over if we don 't find another source of energy ! Great Vega . According to my studies , there is an energy source on Earth called super uranium . Continue . Why don 't we try the super uranium ? Alright , bring the super uranium and refine it . Move immediately ; we don 't have time to waste . Let 's go ! Yes , Sir ! Professor , look at this information . Now we have all the information about the black hole . The computer will take care of the rest of the work . Yamada , what 's the matter ? Yes , wait . Let me check . I don 't see any malfunction in the device itself . The disturbance is the reason for the disorder . Disturbance ? Yes and very strong one ! Hayashi how is the situation of the radar ? Bad , there is no use ! Professor , it is not a normal matter at all . Let me go out immediately ! Alright . Go , but you must not act in a hasty way , Kouji . Don 't worry about me . Double Spazer Go ! Engine Start ! Double Spazer Go ! Hayashi , tune the wave to the special channel that Daisuke set up and analyze it , let 's go ! Yes . Oh , there is reception ! Look , it must be the enemy ! What ? And it 's massive too ! Is it coming this way ? No , it is heading towards point X-80 Y-65 . The Super Uranium Base is located over there ! And if the super uranium blows up , what will happen ? Major casualties will occur due to the destructive atomic rays ! Huh ? Yes , Daisuke here ! A massive enemy force is heading towards the Super Uranium Base . Kouji went out but he is hasty . Remember , the super uranium must not blow up ! Alright , I understood , I will go immediately ! Hikaru ... Daisuke ... Are you going to another battlefield ? Yes . Daisuke , I know that you may die in the battle and not return , but it sorrows me ... What makes me sad ... what makes me sad that I can 't help you in anything . Daisuke , I wanted to please you with my new dress , but it had no meaning ... At all ... at all it didn 't ... Hikaru ... Nothing pleases me more than your warm heart . Don 't worry , I won 't get killed . Wait for me . Good bye . Hikaru ... I am sorry ... Duke Fleed ' . ! Grendizer Go ! I don 't think Grendizer will notice our operations , because their radar is jammed . Minster Zuril , are you sure that Grendizer won 't appear ? I am sure , don 't worry . Alright ! Let the super uranium possession operation begin ! The saucer beast arrived ! The saucer beast arrived ! Attack it immediately ! Attack it immediately ! Damn Vegan forces You are play filthy trick The results will not be as what you expected ! Missile , launch ! Where did the saucer beast go ? I see , they are trying to take the tank ! You won 't succeed ! Damn you ! There are going to problems , I won 't be able to confront by myself , I will withdraw if Grendizer doesn 't come to help me . Cyclone Beam ! Spin Saucer ! Oh , there he is finally ! Kouji , the saucer beast is busy with the super uranium tank . Let 's get rid of this annoyance first ! Roger that . Spin Saucer ! Melt Shower ! Double Cutter ! That is the last one ! Alright , and now to the saucer beast . If I ascend above , I will lose my grip over it , I must resort to the last method . It 's dangerous but there is no other option . Kouji ! I will attack from the ground , and you attack the saucer beast from above ! Huh ? And what about the tank if it falls ? Leave the tank for me . But ... I will descend to fight him on the ground ! I understood . Dizer Go ! Kouji , be careful ! Cyclone Beam ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! Damn ! Full Power ! Saved safely . I wonder how is Kouji ? Duke Fleed . What is the matter , Kouji ? The saucer beast is heading towards Shirakaba farm ! What ? Shirakaba farm ? ! Alright , I will launch behind it immediately ! Spazer Go ! Spazer Cross ! What a cowardly saucer beast ! Minster Zuril , Grendizer appeared and our plans were ruined ! What are you going to do regarding that ? After situation changed , I will make Gan Gan destroy The Space Science Center . I am not sure if Gan Gan is able to do that . I have a good idea ! Gan Gan , go and capture those two ! Kouji , you must stop it before it reaches Shirakaba farm . I can 't do that my Cyclone Beam doesn 't affect from this distance . Alright , then I will do it instead of you . Get out of my way , Kouji ! Duke Fleed , Kouji , something horrific has happened ! Hikaru and Goro are where the saucer beast is heading ! Damn ! The saucer beast has found the two ? ! What is that ? Sister , look , something is coming from over there , look ! Oh , it is the flying saucer beast ! Damn ! Cyclone Beam ! It is no use ! It is coming towards us , Goro run faster ! Let 's go , hurry ! Let 's go . Duke Fleed , it will be too late if we leave Hikaru . Let me ram it when it slows down as it gets close to them . Kouji , don 't be hasty ! Their matter will be finished ! Hurry HP ! Now ! Kouji , are you alright ? I am in the best condition ; I will bring Hikaru and Goro right away . Could you please take care of the saucer beast ? Alright , I will do . Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Dizer Kick ! Hand Beam ! My Wound ! Does that emit atomic Vegatron rays ? Are you alright , Kouji ? You are wounded . Don 't worry , it doesn 't hurt . Damn ! Kouji ! I have to be awake . Kouji , are you alright ? Professor , don 't worry . I have put Hikaru and Goro in Double Spazer . I understood . By the way , your wound is major . It is better that you return immediately . Alright , I understood . Damn ! Kouji ! Kouji , pull yourself together , come on ! I am alright , Hikaru . I was really worried about you . I wonder how Daisuke 's doing ? There won 't be any hope for me in front of that beam . Double Harken ! Back Hand Beam ! Daisuke ! Where is Daisuke ? Yes , the one that is fighting now is Daisuke ! Look , don 't you see him ? Kouji , do something . Daisuke is fighting against a ruthless enemy ! I wish I could , but my condition is very bad . I have no choice but to withdraw from here . Kouji ! Hikaru , it looks like I am done for it . I have no strength . What is the matter , Kouji ? You are slowing down ! Press the auxiliary button , or else you will crash ! My strength wore out , the jolt that afflicted me is really hurting me ! Kouji , listen ! Given your situation , let Hikaru pull the control instead of you , understood ? Yes . Hikaru , can you please pull that throttle ? Yes , which one ? That one ! Pull it with all your strength ! There is no use ! My left hand doesn 't reach it ! Try it ; pull it with the right only ! What is the matter Hikaru ? Your left hand as well , hurry ! I reached it ! Come on , pull it ! Hurry , Hikaru ! Well done , Hikaru . I can 't continue , do something . Alright . Kouji , find a way to switch your seat with Hikaru . I understood . Damn you ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! Space Thunder ! Hikaru . Did Kouji inform you how to use the control device ? You must pull back ! Hurry ! Daisuke ! Hikaru , we will fall if we remain like this , pull the control ! Kouji ! Daisuke is in danger ... Teach me how to fight ! Please ! Hikaru , no , that is about your capacity . Please , Uncle . Tell Kouji to allow me . Daisuke will get killed if we leave him this way , please tell him ! No , that is dangerous . You can 't do that . But ... He won 't be able to last long ! Uncle , hurry , something must be done to help Daisuke ! I am prepared for impulsion against the saucer beast ! Alright , if you are serious . Kouji ... Kouji ... Listen ; let us try despite the danger . We will leave everything to Hikaru . Alright , I understood . Alright , Hikaru , are you ready ? Do what I say . Pull the control stick so that we ascend . Now ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Thanks God that is wonderful ! And now , Hikaru . A round trip . Turn the control stick to the left . Alright , Hikaru . A straight line now . I will explain how we engage an attack . Listen well . First , press on the switch to the right of your seat after fixing your target . No , not that one ! Press it and the Double Cutter launches . And when the saucer beast stumbles , direct a finishing blow with Cyclone Beam . Keep holding it . After that , ascend above . What is your opinion , Hikaru ? Can you do it ? I think so . Rather , there is no escape from that ! I will get a chance to be helpful . - All of what I have done was waiting , while you and Daisuke were both fighting . But now , I am ... I am able to fight and help you . - I know your feeling , Hikaru . And now a last word , if you fail , the saucer beast will attempt a counter attack on us . In that situation , I fear you will not be able to escape . This is your chance . I understand . It is one chance , but I will not fail . But I can 't leave everything now ! I will not let Daisuke die , EVER ! Hikaru , you succeeded ! Daisuke ... You regained your conscience . I am ... Hikaru , thank you . I heard everything from my Father . But , Hikaru . Promise me that you will never do that again . Look at the sun . I will never give this beautiful Earth to the inhabitants of Planet Vega . I vow to defend the Earth with all means . Hikaru , I don 't want you in particular to fight . Daisuke ... UFO . UFO . Listen ! Since our perpetual Vegatron power source , the Vegatron star was destroyed then energy at Skull Moon Base is not going to be enough . If the energy runs out , then our plan to invade Earth will end in failure , understood ? We know this very well . General Gandal , I want super uranium from Earth at any cost . We will make the Earth a new energy base , did you both understand ? Yes , Great Vega . They are after super uranium . They tried destroying Grendizer or destroying the Earth , but didn 't succeed until now . Professor , how do you interpret the change ? They rely on Vegatron for power and I am sure that something happened to the power source . That 's correct , I see . If they are seeking a new source of energy , then they are in a state of desperation and will most probably attack us viciously . Let them come at any time ! We are prepared to confront them with Grendizer and Double Spazer ! A new war has been waged , so I need you to understand the situation and be prepared . - Yes . - Yes . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Thirty Eight . A Tearful Connection with Hikaru . Settle down ! Come on ! Settle down ! Settle down ! Settle down ! Come on ! Hikaru ! What are you doing ? Stop ! It is the fiercest horse in our farm ; it is too much for you ! It is dangerous ! I said stop ... Calm down . Settle down . Let 's go . Hikaru , it is milk time ! Come down ! I said come down , Hikaru ! Hurry up and let 's finish ... HIKARU ! Where are you going to ? ! I am sorry , Father . But I have important work to do , I want to help Daisuke . Move ! Hikaru . What is the meaning of this fast running ? Don 't you realize the danger ? I don 't fear anything . I can even tame Double Spazer . I know this because Kouji showed me how to do it . I have to learn how to do that by myself ! And this is training for that , yes ! Is it training for fighting the enemy ? Of course ! Alright . Follow me ! Don 't give up . Let 's go ! Run ! That Hikaru is good for nothing . Where did she go this morning ? Even though she has to help me . Alright . Okay , okay ! Here we go ... Who is that ? Hi ... Hikaru ! Hikaru , wait a second . Hikaru ! Wait me ! I don 't know what Hikaru admires in a person like Daisuke . Let 's go ! Move . Try to understand , Hikaru . The battle will get more ruthless and I can 't bear to see you getting involved in it . I hope you think of what I am saying . Hikaru , say something ! Speak ! Don 't you ever understand what I say ? Or do you find it wrong to wander off with such an individual without my permission ? Don 't forget that you are a teenager . And you should not involve yourself with someone like Daisuke . And what merit does he have ? He is a lazy bum and is good for nothing , at all ... Daddy ! Daisuke is good for nothing ? Daddy , isn 't it a shame to say that ? You don 't know anything about Daisuke , he is a good man . Daisuke is ... GORO ! Daisuke is ... Daisuke is ... Say what you are thinking about , what is Daisuke ! Daisuke is good for nothing at all ? I want you to retract what you said . If you don 't , then I will feel really sad ... very much ! I ... I ... I am afraid you exaggerated ... I said take back what you said , Daddy . Come on ! - Alright ! Maybe I went a bite overboard . - Yes , you 've gone so far ! How does it look ? Eh , I see it , I see it perfectly clear . Something magnificent ! The suitable thing ! That is Photo Quantum ; it is energy for Grendizer and Double Spazer . Even though the analogous energy units are not visible to the naked eye , but we can see them clearly with this binocular . Analogous energy units are many times as powerful as super uranium . As well , they are not harmful . By using this analogous energy units binocular , we can get power in a way easier than before . You are truly a great scientist , Professor . The analogous energy units that we discovered by the scholars of Planet Fleed are now being put in the service of a lot of people , I am very happy . Professor , large quantities of analogous energy units are in the air . What ? I discovered them with the energy units binocular that is attached to the telescope . It is a huge quantity. if we collect it , then it would be great energy . Professor , why don 't you assemble the collective device on Double Spazer ? I will go to collect the energy ! Hold on , Kouji . You know that the area is at the end of the atmosphere , if you go there , then the Allied Vegan Forces may spot you . I know that . But Grendizer will be more visible , so I insist on going right away . Alright , I shall get ahead of you to divert their attention to me , and during that time , you collect the energy units . Let 's go . Alright . Attach the collective device to Double Spazer quickly , let 's go . Duke Fleed ! Grendizer Go ! Ready to launch ! Alright . Get super uranium from Earth . And new , saucer beast Day Day and Minifo , get to work ' . ! What is that ? What happened ? Sorry for disturbing , Grendizer appeared ! What ? He is trying to locate our base . Now he is flying over area X-13-42 . Damn you Grendizer ! Alright then , we will make Grendizer the first victim ! I don 't believe Duke Fleed took notice of Skull Moon Base . Is it possible that he is trying to aimlessly locate our base ? No way . Grendizer has a worthy reason to come . So what is the reason ? What is it ? Finally you came to meet me ? Let 's begin ! Spin Saucer . This is Kouji . This is impressive . The analogous energy units are everywhere . I will collect them ! Great , I hope for your success , Kouji . Oh , I wish I was in Kouji 's place . Minster Zuril , saucer launches ! Here I come ! Spin Saucer ! Melt Shower ! Damn ! He is very strong ! Grendizer is fighting the saucer beast now ! What is that ? It seems he got in a fight in the space . Daisuke ! Daisuke , you are very far away from here , in space . It grieves me that I can 't do anything except watch you . This is a diversion operation . Their aim is something else . That 's right ! Alright , we search the Earth 's atmosphere thoroughly . Yes , Sir ! What is that ? That 's it then . But , what is he doing there ? Capture him with the seizing ray and bring him to Skull Moon Base now ! Here they are ! I almost gathered all the required quantities of the units of the analogous energy . There is no reason for me to stay . What is this electric wave ! Damn ! Damn ! Double Cutter . You idiots ! We won 't be able to chase him ! Let 's get out of here ! Come on move immediately ! Minster Zuril , what is your opinion of us attacking Grendizer ? That is not my business . I am the Minister of Science Zuril , not Commander of the Attack Force . Are you ignorant of that ? I am the Minister of Science ! Kouji ! The analogous energy units are safe ... Kouji ! Kouji ! Be brave . My body is paralyzed . Kouji , be brave ! I will treat you immediately ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Screw Punch ! Double Harken ! Daisuke ! Daisuke , hold on , do your best and beat him ! Hikaru how is Kouji ? He is not alright . I see . Then there is no benefit from Double Spazer . Daisuke ! I can do it ... I can do it , I must do it ! Hey , what are you doing ? I am going to fight the enemy . You are still little ! I want to go now , I must go ! What ? Where do you want to go ? My sister went in Double Spazer , Father . What ? Double ... Double ? ! Grendizer is in danger , Father ! What do you mean ? I mean that Duke Fleed is in danger ! What happened to ... ! - What did you say ? Who is that Duke Fleed you are talking about ? - Oh , Father , I am in a hurry ... I ... I ... Who is this Duke Fleed ? Tell me now , Goro . I am in hurry now , I will see you later , bye ... Goro , wait ! I haven 't finished talking yet ! Hold on , wait ! It is a Vegatron beam ! Good timing , Kouji ! It is now or never ! Now , Kouji ! Let 's do it . Dizer Jump ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! What is wrong , Kouji ? Make sure about the timing in the next try we will make . Now , let 's do it ! Daisuke , my life is with you . Dizer Jump ! Combination Cross ! Screw Punch ! We succeeded ! We succeeded ! Hikaru ! Daisuke ! What do you mean with that , Daisuke ? I am offended by you , believe me ! Is that your identity ? Don 't pretend ! What is the idea of not telling me in particular that you are Duke Fleed ? Please , Uncle . Am I a person that can 't be trusted ? I am not happy at all ! Watch what I will do now ! I will kill myself ! No , don 't stop me ! I am insist , Daisuke ! That is enough , Uncle . Hikaru took part with us like an excellent member . She is really great . You should be proud of her , Mr. Mkiba Danbi . How stupid I am . I didn 't know anything . Huh ? Daisuke ! And finally , even Hikaru joined in defending this Earth . We must fight to defend this beautiful Earth . Alright , Hikaru . Let 's fight together . UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Thirty Nine . A Surprise Assault Triggered by Planet Vega 's Forces . General Gandal . Yes , Sir . There is no disputing that Grendizer is related to this issue . The Space Science Center and Double Spazer must be occupied immediately ! That 's true my Master . Why don 't we mobilize then ? I am afraid we have been wrong , Sir . The reality is that we have repeated our assaults on the Space Science Center . You have no excuse ! Y ... Yes , Sir . The Great Vega . Since our attacks on the front and the infiltration methods have failed there remains the surprise assault . And how will you accomplish this method ? We will make our saucer beast mislead Grendizer and Double Spazer , and then our forces will attack The Space Science Center . An idea ; a suicide attack . Alright , let 's try the attack ! By your order , Sir . The important question is finding the saucer beast , that will cling to Grendizer and Double Spazer . What is your opinion , Minster Zuril ? That saucer beast is available with us , Sir . And now ! The Wiy School representative ... Makiba Hikaru . Sister ! Do your best ! Amazing ! Like a space woman ! And the result is ... 9.80 . - Hey , you 've done amazing ! - You 've done very well , Hikaru ! Amazing ! Outstanding ! And the result is 9.85 . Amazing ! Hmm , what do you think ? I am so proud of her . Daisuke , What about you ? And the final result is 9.90 ! It seems that she is engaging in a formidable confrontation in this show . The Winner In the First Place ... Makiba Hikaru ! You have no objection now , Daisuke . Did you see ? Hikaru is a superior girl . Isn 't that so ? When Planet Vega attacks , I want Hikaru to have a fitting role , eh ? Eh ? What 's that ? Sport is something and military technique is something else ! What do you mean ? Leave the attack of Planet Vega 's Forces to me and Kouji . Did you understand me ? See you later . Hey , Daisuke ! Wait ! What a cold heart you have ! Why he has done that ? ! Guru ... Don 't misunderstand me Goro , please . I don 't belittle your father or Hikaru . Please believe me . I am truthful in my words . Clarify your point . Hmm , okay I will . It is hard for me to explain , but war is not a show or a pastime . Believe me nothing is more beautiful than peace . Look at me ; do you like howl look ? This is the best look in the true meaning . Here . In any case , I don 't blame your father if he got annoyed . The enemy will attack us at any moment . So that your father must be always ready . They may attack us anytime . Did you accept my explanation ? Perhaps you understood my explanation , Goro . Huh ? Professor , we pinpointed a UFO 's location ! On Zero-Black and Nine-Blue ! Prepare the telescope immediately . I will launch immediately , Professor ! Alright , Grendizer will follow you immediately . Yes . Daisuke ... Daisuke ! A UFO is headed in our direction ! Daisuke . A saucer beast is headed in our direction ! Leave me , Hikaru , please ! Let me go ! Please take me with you ; I am in your team after all . You will live only once . Take care of yourself . I am prepared to sacrifice my life ! My life doesn 't worry me ! No , I won 't listen to you ! Get out of my way ! You are idiot ! Stubborn ! There is no use ! Hikaru must never get involved in the war ! Double Spazer Launch ! Professor , I am heading towards Mount B ! Mount B ? Nothing is there except a wasted mine . Hurry and make sure to know what is going on . Oh , I am landing now . Alright , watch closely when you get close to it . Roger that . Oh ! I discovered the saucer beast on top of the mine ! The saucer is going far but I am pursuing it ! Wait , don 't do that ! But ... Kouji , leave it and return to the mine and scrutinize it . Maybe you will find something ! Okay . Professor , I don 't see anything out of the ordinary . Alright , return now quickly . Eh ? But where the saucer beast went to ? It launched into outer space . I saw it ! Damn ! How fast it is ! The attack forces is here , the attack forces is here ! We infiltrated successfully to Earth . Alright . Prepare to start the operations right away and beware of the enemy 's security cameras . Roger that . Fly at a low altitude and don 't get revealed to the radars . Move ! Let 's go ! Strange . Why does the saucer beast hover around without an aim ? But I didn 't notice anything strange . , and we don 't see anything strange on the radar . What a strange situation ... They want to deceive us . These are the customs , Hikaru . Did you understand ? Everyone has his own technique , and we must be bound to them . What is that ? Makiba sense something is going to happen . Let 's postpone the training . Come on , Hikaru ! Planet Vega 's Soldiers ! What are they plotting against us , Hikaru ? We succeeded . We are ready for the operations . We can attack the Space Science Center immediately . I will dispatch the saucer beast to make Grendizer fall into the trap . Roger that . We have to report about them . Yes we have to do that , hurry ! People from Earth ? Follow them , come on ! Wa ... Wait , Hikaru ! Father ! We will fall into their hands . I will deceive them so that you can go . So you can go and inform the Professor . But . Come on , hurry ! Yes . Which way did they take ? What is that sound ? It must be one of them ! He is over there ! They took the bait . Stupid ! I must hurry to tell them about the invaders . Professor , we located the saucer beast ! Father ! Let 's go now , Daisuke ! Wait ! I smell a trap with which they have prepared to deceive us . A trap ? Let 's wait until the matter becomes clearer to us . Saucer Beast Wra Wra , destroy everything that you see , so Grendizer and Double Spazer falls into our trap ! The saucer beast destroyed the coastal manufacturing plants , look ! What ? The coastal manufacturing plants ? Professor , let me start repelling them ! But ... If we don 't being repelling them now , they will destroy the entire city ! Professor ! Father ! Alright , launch . Yes . The time of settlement has come . Huh ' ? Duke Fleed ' . ! And Kouji as well , my God ! It is no use searching . Return to the UFO ships . It is not wise to fight here , it is better that I lure it far away from the city . Spin Drill ! Alright , follow me now , saucer beast . Duke Fleed , one moment and I will join you ! Hand Beam ! Melt Shower ! Spin Saucer ! Dizer Go ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Hand Bea ... Double Spazer , hurry and come to help me ! It is time , launch ! My God ! They are very close . I must mislead the enemy until Duke Fleed returns . I must ! That is right ! I will use Duke 's motorcycle ! Here I come . I will brawl with them until Duke returns ! Buggy Missile ! OH ! Pr ... Professor ! Hikaru is fighting with the soldiers of Planet Vega ! What ? Hikaru got involved in the war ? This is something terrible ! Start the alarm ! Yes . As I thought , it was a trap . I am coming , Grendizer ! Let 's go ! Cyclone Beam ! Kouji , you came in time . Daisuke . We are under a surprise attack from Planet Vega 's Soldiers . Return to us immediately ! Hikaru is in danger ; she is fighting by herself with the Duke Buggy ! I knew she will do that . I am coming back now ! Dizer Jump ! Attachment Open ! Scrambler Turn ! Combination Cross ! Use the Double Cutter immediately ! Alright ! Double Cutter ! Damn it doesn 't work ! We have to hurry ! Hikaru is in danger ! Buggy Saucer ! Hikaru ! This is the utmost of your ability ! Don 't get involved more ! Hurry and return now the Research Center ! Yes . Alright ! Now bring down the building with the laser beam ! Duke , come on hurry to help me ! Damn , how corrupted they are ! Very powerful ! We must do something ! We have to get out of this position to help Hikaru ! Alright , let 's try Spazer and its Spin Saucer weapon . Spazer Go ! Energy Full Power ! I will pull it so hard ! Now ! Spin Saucer ! Let 's fight , saucer beast ! Hand Beam ! Cyclone Beam ! Double Cutter ! Space Thunder ! Separation Cross ! Spazer Cross ! I will return ahead of you , Kouji ! The opening is almost broken . Come on , annihilate it ! Duke Fleed , hurry ! Oh ! Grendizer is there ? Escape ! Duke Fleed ! Spin Saucer ! If it weren 't for Hikaru 's efforts , the Research Center would 've been leveled . Daisuke . I am certain that the enemy 's assaults will intensify for it is ruthless . It is good for us to get Hikaru 's assistance . What do you think , Daisuke ? I understood . I will protect your life , Hikaru . That is the best solution ! Danbi , we now have a youthful group of eagles . I have never been as happy as today , Doctor ! Finally , Hikaru has joined the team of glory ! You 've understand , Hikaru ? Do your best ! UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Fourty . An Intense Crash ; The Sea is Blazing . A submarine volcano has erupted ! Saturated uranium roots are exploding one after the other ! The base is in danger ! To the shelters immediately ! To the shelters immediately ! These are not only as a result of the explosions of the submarine volcanoes . There are other explosions on the ocean floor ; and I believe that it is the saturated uranium energy . General Gandal . Come to the main center of the operations immediately . What happened , Minister Zuril ? I found something on Earth the resembles the uranium root at sea bottom . What ? Uranium ? Are you sure ? The explosion indicated the presence of uranium . Alright . I will authorize the saucer beast to collect this precious mineral right away ! This saucer beast is capable . Living things from the floating star thrive on uranium as a source of energy . And this saucer beast is Boi Boi from the floating star . Alright , Saucer Beast Boi Boi , launch immediately ! That is the uranium storage tank ! That 's correct . If the tank catches fire from the submarine volcano ... What will happen ? W ... What will happen ? All islands within a 100 kilometer radius will be extinct . The air all over Canto 's district will be polluted due to the radioactivity . The ministry of Defense requested all facilities and laboratories to cooperate in a counteraction . And all forces have been mobilized to face this dangerous situation and they asked help from our institute . Cooperation ? What can we do ? All we have to do is prevent that tank from exploding . Protect the tank ! Daisuke ! Would you go ? Yes . Daisuke , what do you intend to do ? I will take the tank to a safe place , and face the situation immediately . I understood , I will go with you ! Oh ! I will go , too ! Good luck . Duke Fleed ' . ! Grendizer Go ! Double Spazer , launch ! I will go first ! Full Power ! Over there ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Double Harken ! Duke Fleed ' . ! Do your best ! Kouji , I am fine , don 't worry . Monitor and await my instructions . Roger that . Duke Fleed . Hurry , the island will explode ! I did it . Duke , danger ! Dizer Jump ! Scrambler Turn ! Combination Cross ! You did well . Beautiful is our success while holding the tank . Alright , we will proceed and place the tank in the Armour at the Scientific Base . We are safe from danger . Take things easy . No , let 's hurry . I fear that the men of Planet Vega might attack us . If they come and find the precious uranium mineral , then they will attack us ! Alright , I understood , let 's hurry ! Professor , a UFO entered the atmosphere ! Adjust the space telescope monitor immediately . Yes . Duke Fleed ' . ! There is a space saucer beast out there . Hurry or else they will discover the matter of the tank . Roger that . Spazer Go ! Kouji , we will descend and avoid the space saucer beast . Duke , there is the space saucer beast . Damn ! It came very fast ! Spin Saucer ! Melt Shower ! Duke , we will wait and strike again . No ! We will attack now . If harms befall the tank , then the matter will be out of our hands ! Double Missile , launch ! Spin Drill ! The island ! The base can be seen ! Melt Shower ! General Gandal ! We received the certain answer ! Locate the target now ! Yes , Sir ! That 's correct , there is another source of power that the tank , and I believe it to be much greater . With that energy we can supply The Skull Moon Base and become even better than what it was before . Engine Stop ! Spazer Descend ! I am sure that the saucer beast discovered the uranium mineral . Let 's leave now ! Okay ! Grendizer is following it ! What ? Alright , pull it and give it the finishing blow ! No , not now ! After the saucer beast gathers the uranium mineral . You are the right hand in the battle . This depends on our luck in being able to overcome them . This is a good chance , I will handle the matter . But ... Hikaru , how is the situation ? We are getting close . I found it ! Kouji , there it is ! I found it ! Alright ! The depth is 650 feet ; it reveals the reaction of the uranium mineral . Daisuke ! What about the energy level ? Half the energy left and that suffices to kill it . But your energy goes down to half at that depth . Continuation threatens your life . Death or salvation ! Let me try ! Stop , Daisuke ! Let 's view what 's above the sea . Daisuke ... Kouji ! I will go into the sea and you monitor the sky closely with Double Spazer . Okay . Roger that . Separation Go ! Duke Fleed ' . ! Duke Fleed ' . ! Damn ! I wish our Double Spazer was able to go into the sea ! Daisuke ... Do your best ... Damn you ! Duke Fleed ' . ! Do your best ! Screw Punch ! Oh , the energy ! Double Harken ! Come on Boi Boi , give him the finishing blow ! Eh ... What happened ? An error occurred in the energy center . Wait , I will take a look . What is wrong ? There is no use . I used up all the energy ! General Gandal , what are we going to do ? Didn 't I tell you to take the energy into consideration first ? It seems that you don 't understand the extent of the importance of energy . And now it is my turn to take charge . Alright ! Reserve energy capsule ! Minister Zuril , no one is allowed to use the energy without permission from Great Vega ! I will ask for permission later . Oh , it is working ! The Saucer Beast Boi Boi ... The Saucer Beast Boi Boi ... Stop pursuing Grendizer and gather the uranium mineral immediately ! Damn it ! That was close ! Duke Fleed ' . ! Duke Fleed ' . ! What happened to him ? At this time he loses all his energy . He will be in danger if oxygen is cut off ! What is that ? Look , that is ... Duke Fleed ' . ! Duke Fleed ' . ! Duke ... Duke Fleed ' . ! Kouji , I am alright ! Duke Fleed , I feel relieved because you are alright . We were both worried . The saucer beast is approaching ! Duke Fleed , what about your energy level ? It is not okay . Alright , we shall fight the saucer beast with Double Spazer now . No , we have to help Duke Fleed first ! But I don 't want it to get out of my sight ! Don 't pronounce such things . Hurry , our duty is to help Duke Fleed immediately ! Don 't worry about me . Hurry and don 't let get away ! We shouldn 't leave Duke Fleed in this stat . Come on , Kouji , help him right now ! I understood . NO , DON 'T DO IT ! Kouji ! What will happen if the enemies possess the uranium mineral ? These are the orders of the leader . Hurry and follow up with them ! I understood , leader . Boi Boi , well done ! The precious uranium will multiply our power and with this , we will be able to eliminate Grendizer ! What is your opinion , General Gandal ? You shouldn 't take Grendizer 's might lightly . Look ! Damn it ! What a bad luck ! But we will lose the uranium and fall into trouble if we fight them . You said you will eliminate them after you get the uranium mineral . There is no benefit from talking . Space Saucer Beast Boi Boi , try to succeed in escaping ! Cyclone Beam ! Double Missile ! Double Cutter ! Don 't let these little ones eliminate you ! You must cut your way through them and retain the precious uranium ! NO ! You will strike them before they can do anything ! Saucer Beast Boi Boi ! Take Grendizer as hostage ! They are attacking Grendizer ! Duke , DANGER ! Double Missile ! What were you going to do if the missile got Duke Fleed due to an error in aiming ? If I only have a bit of energy ... SPACE THUNDER ! Double Cutter ! We will eliminate them ! We will eliminate them in another attempt ! In the ocean ! We are able to eliminate Grendizer in the ocean ! I am sorry for making you wait . And now it is finished . Everyone look at this , this is Marine Spazer . Marine Spazer ? When we finalize this Spazer , Grendizer will not be conquered even in the ocean . Really amazing ! Hikaru . This will be yours . Kouji pilots Double Spazer , and Hikaru pilots Marine Spazer . These two Spazers are Grendizer 's hands , Daisuke , take care of them . Yes . UFO . UFO . UFO Robe Grendizer ' . Episode Fourty One . The Launching of The Marine Spazer . That is Manet Gama . The raging sea is the major section of Planet Gamo . The storm never settles down there . Some of the living things on this planet . Look ! What is that creature ? Capture it immediately ! I understood , we will turn it into a saucer beast . That 's right . Grendizer becomes weak in the water . With the help of the saucer beast , we can defeat Grendizer and send him to hell . Hmm , I understood , Goro . It is the Marine Spazer . Yes , Daddy . The Marine Spazer or the Aquatic Spazer . Aquatic ? Yes , the Aquatic . Ah , I understood . I think it is the pretty Spazer because of the beautiful Hikaru is piloting it . Isn 't that right ? My God , how annoying ! Professor , I hope it is completed quickly for Hikaru . Yes . It has become known to the enemy that Grendizer cannot use its full power in the sea . They will take some measures and attack it . We must hurry and finish everything . That 's right , we must . Alright . Now , prepare the Marine Cutter . In any case , where is Hikaru ? I need to talk to her before she goes to the battle . Ah , don 't bother her ; she is in a special training now .

It is a pity that the wound still hurts him ! Please hurry . It the enemy attacks us now , we will have to fight them at sea even without Daisuke . I hope that everyone hurries up with the work ! Professor , a huge group of flying saucers ! And now they entered the atmosphere ! Huh ? What is the matter ? They are the enemies . They came from Planet Vega ! Damn ! Daisuke ! You should not go ! Goro , the enemies are attacking us . I must go immediately ! Impossible , because of your wound . I will go to meet them . Don 't go ! Oh ... Daisuke ! Daisuke , you should not go ! NO ! What you are saying ? I must go ! Daisuke ... Double Spazer , launch ! Double Spazer Go ! Grendizer Go ! Duke Fleed ! Kouji ! Hikaru !

Now , Minifo squad , go to the sea bottom and gather the uranium and hurry to return . Do not forget that securing the energy is a fundamental objective . The objective of the Minifo is the uranium mineral at sea bottom . We must prevent them from gathering it . Kouji ! Pursue the Minifo squad ! But what must I do to eliminate that ? We must conquer this stubborn one first ! Wait . Leave it to me and pursue the Minifo right away . Let 's go ! Let 's combine , and after eliminating this one , we go to strike the Minifo ! Shut up and go after them now ! But I want to fight this one ! This is an order from the leader , go now ! I understood , I understood ! And now , let 's fight to finish . Shoot In ! Dizer Go !

Cyclone Beam ! Professor , hasn 't the Marine Spazer been completed ? Yes , it has been completed . Good . Then let Hikaru go ! We did not initiate the test flight . It is impossible to launch it now . What ? Do you want to cause shame to the family ? Danbi ! Don 't call me like that ! Danbi ! Hikaru completed the special trainings , I beg you . Let her go now , please ! Professor . Do it , Professor ! Please . Prepare the Marine Spazer . Let 's go ! The Marine Spazer is ready ! Engine Start ! Marine Spazer Go ! My sister , do your best !

Isn 't that true , Hikaru ? Yes , we will be victorious . Kouji and Hikaru , because our unity , we shall vanquish all of the enemies ! UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Forty Two . An Emergency Situation in The Space Science Center . Oh Lord ! Oh Lord ! Huh ! What is that ? It seems like a large truck passed by . Hey , Hikaru ! Someone is going to The Space Science Center . Let 's go and see who that is . Come on ride the horses to there . Yes . Professor . The computer for the observation unit has arrived , I will bring it down . Good , let 's go and bring it down . Slowly , slowly ! Stop ! And finally the computer has arrived . Professor Umon ! You must tell me what is the benefit of this machine of yours ! Mr. Danbi , this is a computer and it is the head of the observation unit . Observation unit ? Computer ? I don 't understand these things . By the way , Professor . What do you do with a strange machine like that ? I don 't know what is going on here . It is a big and scary machine ! We prepare for an assault that is carried out by Vegan forces . For Vegan assault ? That 's correct . They 've discovered a lot of matters about this Center , but as long as we have this machine nothing will set us back , isn 't that so Professor ? What is wrong ? You are not certain ? As long as we have the Double Spazer and Grendizer , we will not allow the union of the Vegan planet to touch one hair of this center , if they attack us ! Don 't worry . Don 't forget Hikaru 's Marine Spazer ! Oh , I am sorry , I forgot . Listen everyone . Let 's all go to install the computer . Yes . And I will help you . Thank you , Danbi . What ? Is that right ? That is right . Now we know the method to gain Vegatron energy . Really ? Alright , then let 's develop a new plan to attack Umon 's Research Center . We will success this time . Wonderful and I prepared a leading ship for your use , General Gandal . How wonderful that is , thank you ! However , we must take out time in devising a plan for complete success . In the past , we failed completely in the attack . And all of this because of Grendizer because it is protected by Umon 's Research Center . If we just succeed in destroying Umon 's Research Center we disconnect Grendizer from the Center . And we have for this purpose , a saucer beast that is superior in defense . And we prepare my special ship with the powerful Vegatron Laser ; a fantastic idea ! Alright . I will being the work right away . What ? Father ... Hello , Daisuke . Tell me Father , what 's the matter ? Are you facing any stresses ? It seems to me that you are very worried . Hmm , I have no stresses , but the matter is other than that . Father . Does a potential attack initiated by the union of the Vegan planets worry you ? No , the matter is not like that . In any case ... There is no doubt that this Center will incur an assault from them . And we can 't protect this Center in any way from the enemies with the current defense system , it is not certain that Grendizer and Double Spazer will be able to protect it . I am not sure if they are able to keep protecting The Research Center . Daisuke . An extensive betterment must happen in the Center . Implement what you see appropriate , Father . That is correct , that is what I am thinking of . Since a number of years I have been implementing the plan step by step . Nothing is left except turning on the main computer . Why don 't you turn it on right away ? That is what 's worrying me ; I want to do that . I want to do that , but you know what my dream is ... Daisuke . My dream ... is to solve what I can of the mysteries of the vast universe ; the universe that doesn 't end . The more I learn about it , the deeper it gets . The universe always grants me amazement and new impressions . And because the universe grants me such feelings , I established this Center . But ... The evil union of the Vegan planets came and attacked the cities and killed the people . Therefore , this Center has begun to turn into a tool of war ! I will put a stop to that if it is possible ! I will never accept turning this Center to a tool of war ! I will never accept turning on the computer that easily . Daisuke . Oh , Daisuke . What worries you ? Don 't worry ; someone has to resist the union of the Vegan planets . I prepared for that . For that I rebuilt the Center . But it is hard for me to forget an old dream . This is the only problem , and I must beat it . I must beat it , and you are with me in this ! Start the attack on Umon 's Research Center . The entire army , go ! Duke Fleed will pursue the Saucer Beast Gau Gau without leniency . Without his noticing that it is a trap . If Umon 's Center disappeared , then he will not find a place to return to . The Saucer Beast Gau Gau , go ! Go and destroy Grendizer ! Oh ! We discovered a UFO ! A huge formation is coming ! What ? A huge formation ? Kouji ! Kouji ! The enemy is coming ! Go immediately , let 's go ! They came ! Alright ! Professor , I understood , I will go immediately ! Engine Start ! Double Spazer Go ! It is coming ! Double Missile ! Heh , that will teach you a lesson ! Huh ! The saucer beast is coming ! Professor , the second attack has begun ! What ? The second attack ? That is correct , and this time , it includes the saucer beast ! Father ! Daisuke ! The second attack that includes the saucer beast is coming . Go immediately . I understood . Cyclone Beam ! Damn you saucer beast ! Cyclone Beam ! Duke Fleed ! Route Number 7 is ready for launch . Grendizer Go ! Kouji ! I will take care of the saucer beast , and you take care of the others ! Roger that . Spin Saucer ! There is something suspicious ; this weapon is not effective . Crusher Punch ! Melt Shower ! Spin Saucer ! Damn ! Don 't escape , come and fight me ! Double Missile ! Professor , I completed my task . Nothing is left except the saucer beast . I will go to help Daisuke . Kouji , wait a bit . It is better that you guard the Center . Why ? Don 't worry they won 't return again . See ya . Kouji , wait ! How illogical he is . Daisuke , what 's the news of the saucer beast ? I am pursuing it now . Father , the strange that it is not effective . Really ? Kouji will go to help you . Hurry and return quickly ! Roger that . Strange ... despite the depth of their attack , they sent an ineffective saucer , something suspicious ! Damn ! It dove in the water . Father ! The saucer beast descended in the water . Send the Marine Spazer immediately ! Alright , I understood . Hikaru , go immediately ! Yes . Welcome Hikaru . We must look for the saucer beast from the water surface first after we combine . Roger that . Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Combination Cross ! Hikaru , did you find it ? The Marine Spazer is excellent in aquatic monitoring . No . I didn 't find it . Look thoroughly , or you won 't find it as the lake is very deep . Yes . There it is ! What ? Where is it ? It is right under us ! Damn ! Something must be done to get rid of this ! Well done , Gau Gau ! Keep Grendizer in that state as long as possible , so he will lose all of his energy . Alright ! Attack Umon 's Research Center immediately ! Hikaru ! Were you hurt ? No , I am alright . This explains what happened . I am able to see the reason for it weapon 's inability . Then why doesn 't it move ? Ah , that is correct ! Damn ! What are they doing ? They are incapable in the water . Kouji ! What is it ? Kouji , we fell into a trap . The Space Science Center is in danger , return at once ! What ? What do you mean ? The saucer beast is bait to distance me . It can 't conquer Grendizer ! Their aim is to attack the Center ! Alright ! I got that ! I will return right away ! I will monitor you . Father , a dangerous matter . We fell into a trap . What ? We fell into a trap ? Yes . They will attack The Space Science Center soon . Kouji is returning now , but Kouji is not able to defend by himself . Father ! Now is the time to make the decision . Start the comp ... Disturbance ! Father ! Father ! We no longer have any other choice . Switch on the computer ! Switch it on the computer immediately ! Look ! A monstrous saucer beast ! And finally they came ! The first formation , begin the attack ! Switch on the force field generator , let 's go ! How long will this barrier hold out ? Professor , the temperature level of the barrier is rising a lot ! As I though . Begin the descending underground , let 's go ! Eh ! It won 't be good for anything . Look , it will be smashed soon . And my turn comes right away ! Double Missile ! It is too late , Kouji . We will descend underground . You must escape ! The Space Science Center will be completely destroyed . Professor ! What you are saying ? ! Professor ! Damn ! Professor , I can 't leave you to your own fate ! Double Cutter ! Huh ! That didn 't benefit very much . The powerful Vegatron Laser ! Standby ! Prepare the observation room . Go to work ! Damn ! There is no use of resisting him ! That is right ! I will us the Anti-Gravity Storm . No ... I can 't do that . Breaking it by force may destroy the Marine Spazer ! What to do ? Do I wait until its energy runs out ? Double Missile ! Damn ! Cyclone Beam ! The time has come to make the decision . I don 't want the Center to be a tool of war if that is possible . Father , we have no other option beside it ! It is not possible to use the computer that easily . Father , use the computer immediately ! Now use the computer immediately ! Daisuke ! I understood . Why didn 't I notice that from the beginning ? Hikaru ! Yes ! Switch on the exhaust . Let 's launch with the saucer beast at the bottom of the lake until it rams a rock ! Hikaru , another time ! Spazer Go ! Hikaru , are you alright ? I ... I am alright . I will connect with Spazer and get ahead of you . I understood that . Damn ! And now the end has come ! Take this you bastard ! Damn ! The Center will get destroyed ! And this will be the last attack ! Descend , Minifo squadron , immediately ! It worked ! PROFESSOR ! Father ! NOW ! What is that ? ! Huh ! That is ... ! Shuttle Open ! Dash Up ! Begin the attack ! Let 's go , Minifo ! Attack ! What ? I will show you the might of the powerful Vegatron Laser again ! Damn ! I lost the powerful Laser . We 're done ! Let 's withdraw immediately ! Dangerous ! Look to the left ! I will destroy and make you cry ! Hand Beam ! Kouji , pass by the beast a hair 's distance away . Roger that . Double Harken ! Daisuke ... Do you see ? I rebuilt the Center secretly . I am sorry for the troubles I caused you . No , we found no troubles , and I knew that you would be fine , as it is expected of you . No , Kouji , you cried a lot ! Oh , I didn 't know you were spying on me ! UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Forty Three . A Deserted Island 's Meteor . Minister Zuril . Are you able to find a point of weakness in The Space Science Center ? Very hard to find . The deficiency of materials has slowed down the assault from Skull Moon Base . This is an abandoned island near the islands of Ojasawara . This island is the result of a volcanic eruption that settled now and no human or bird lives in it . I see . Let 's prepare the base on Earth for the attacks . Discover and attack ; your situation is better than ours by a great deal . But we don 't have time . If we delay the attack , then we will give them the ability to build shielded castles . Then we want to competent commander that is able to build the base quickly . I will send my assistant Gasca . Gasca is a notable commander and distinguished scholar . A correct opinion . Let Gasca come immediately ! Send me Gasca quickly . You called for me , Minister Zuril . Gasca . I order you , to be under the conduct of General Gandal to be in charge of building the base on Earth quickly . Eh ! Me ? I will be the responsible ? That is correct . Yes , and if success is ours in this battle I will promote you to a degree of an eminent commander from the commanders of Vega . I am a mighty commander ! I am Gasca ! Alright . I will definitely prove my success ! I noticed a UFO in the direction of 4-9-2 black . In the direction of 4-9-2 black . A large meteor ? What is that ? Huh ! It is going towards the atmosphere ! The large meteor is pushing through the atmosphere ! It seems like a part of a fierce beast I want an immediate confirmation . Yes . Professor , wait , let me go ! Hey , Kouji ! Double Spazer , Standby Okay ! Are you ready , Kouji ? If anything new happens , connect with me before the attack . Roger that . Alright . Kouji , launch now . Double Spazer Go ! An announcement to all the leaders in the base of Earth I am heading for glory . How long I have waited for this chance ! This is Double Spazer . The meteor is headed for a point between the islands of Ojasawara and Okinozima . Alright , watch out . Roger that . What is the matter , Kouji ? ! Kouji , what is the matter ? Kouji ! Kouji ! Kouji , pull the control to its highest point ! Kouji ! Kouji ! The highest point ! Kouji ! Kouji ! Warning , he is going to the danger zone ! In a short while , he will reach the line of caution ! Father ! It is not within my capability to help him now . I am going to explode ! Oh , you have returned to your conscience , Kouji . Kouji . Kouji . I can see ! I can see again ! Thanks God you are saved . I see well , but what happened to me ? You have returned to your conscience . I must be more careful when pursuing them . Kouji , you made a good conclusion . Be careful . But I want to go ! Kouji , don 't do that . I am very sorry ... Not yet ! Let 's take the opportunity for all of you . Group thinking is the most important thing at the moment . Without any of you , no one has complete powers . Therefore , you should not forget that you are one team under the leadership of Daisuke . Teamwork requires solid cooperation . Do you understand ? Yes . Pro ... Professor ! The new is that the patrol ship was lost near the island of Mayujine . What ? The island of Mayujine ? Damn ! Must we look for it a second time ? Arrest the pilot of Gomi Gomi immediately , don 't ' let him escape . Arrest him ? I ordered observation not attacking . Regardless who the person is , this is my decision ! I will punish those who do not obey orders ! Hurry and go now ! Y ... Ye ... Yes , Sir ! Come on , work quickly ! Damn ! Kouji , hold on ! We must not be selfish as you know .

Alright , let 's go ! IDIOT ! What is this gull doing here ? I understood . A real base that seems like a lake ! Alright ! Double Missile ! Alright , as long as they remain in that place , we will gain the battle . I will never allow them to exit . What is the matter ? A terrible matter ! The base was destroyed ! What ? The base ? Damn you Grendizer . Our base ! In the last stage ! If we succeeded in this phase I will refer you to Vega Daio as a General Commander for Earth 's entire base . Come back , don 't escape ! Minifo ! Minifo , return ! I said come back ! Return ! Return or I will destroy you ! Grendizer ! Grendizer ! It is time to float . Grendizer ! Grendizer ! Both of us are suffering from our eyes .

I have to do something ; I am in a very bad situation . The flash again ! DAMN ! A wonderful accomplishment , Daisuke ! No , this is not my accomplishment ! Rather , the accomplishment of the whole ! What a strong fighter he was . UFO . UFO . Minister Zuril . What do you want from me ? Take a look here . What is that ? They are documents that go back hundreds of years . They were found in Planet Vega and were sent to be decoded . What was written on them ? Many years ago Planet Vega sent flying saucer to Earth that landed in many places with one of them landing near The Space Science Center . What ? A receptive device that transmits electrical signals was left where that saucer landed . A receptive device that transmits electrical signals ? This means we can photograph anything through a telegraph . Without getting Grendizer 's attention . Alright , let 's send a saucer beast to spy on The Space Science Center secret energy source . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Forty Four . The Night of The Celebration With The Saucer Beast . Kouji , do your best ! Don 't worry . Surely , there is no doubt ! These were written hundreds of years ago according to historical times . And this proves that a spaceman came from before . I am sure he was here . What an amazing discovery . I shall read more about this matter at the Cultural Association . What is that ? Who is there ? Get out , you loiterer ! Get out immediately , you idiot ! I said get out immediately you stupid ! What do you want ? It is you as I expected ! Don 't you understand ? I can 't take it anymore ! Don 't go inside the cave again ! My brother ! Midori ! Don 't leave , wait ! You bastard , wait ! Wait ! Hey you ! Where did they go ? From where did they go ? Ah , from this way . Alright . They 've gone far . Thank you very much . I know that you are two cool youngsters . What is the matter ? Tell me . My brother is to blame . He entered the cave over there . The cave ? Yes . I have a great interest in archeology , Sir , and I was studying it in this area . Whatever the reason is , entering this cave without permission is not allowed . But I discovered an amazing thing in the cave ! A spaceman came here from before , from a long time ago ! Eh ! A spaceman ? It is okay ... It 's not important that you don 't believe it . All the villagers think that I am crazy . Oh , Brother ! I will go home first . Enjoy tonight 's celebration . Why don 't you come with me ? I will introduce you to my friends . Eh , where did they go ? I will introduce you to Hikaru and you will be her friend . I am sure of that . No , thank you . I 'd rather stay alone . Is there something bothering you ? Even though we are orphans , and my brother is all I have , yet he spends all of his time looking for ruins . And all the villagers think he is crazy . I got myself used to solitude . You are ... Don 't worry ... Leave me ... Farewell ... Li ... Listen ! Wait ! Look , it is Daisuke ! Farewell . - Good bye ! - Take care , good bye ! Brother ... Brother ... Brother ... I am sure that I saw something shining inside . What is it ? I must discover it . Oh , there it is ! I didn 't know that there was a pit in the cave ! Huh ! A mural ! It is ... This is not a mural . There is a hidden metallic plate in it . Oh , they are spacemen saucer beasts ! It is a spaceman ! You 've seen it . You 've seen the secret of Planet Vegan Forces ! My theory came true ! The mural proves that the spaceman used to be here . DIE ! Grand here . I succeeded in invading the Earth without difficulty . Alright , let The Saucer Beast Duz Duz attack immediately ! Yes , Sir ! Come on ! Get ready , Duz Duz ! Brother ! Brother ! I knew it . He must have gone to the cave . We had a beautiful celebration on Planet Fleed a long time ago . My wound hurts ! Because the Vegatron radioactivity is causing an effect . There is no doubt that Planet Vegan forces are near ! It is the Research Room . No ! Find the Power Room . There it is ! It is the Power Room ! That is it ! Go in it ! The energy generator must be in the back . Quickly without getting their attention ! Huh ? Saucer beasts ? When did they come ? Duke Fleed ! Duke , are you alright ? I am alright . What happened , Duke Fleed ? Saucer beasts are in the Power Room ! Eh ... What ? They are spying on our energy sources . Don 't let them discover the secret at any cost . Send the protective beam ! Yes . Retreat ! I said retreat ! Prepare the emergency equipment , let 's go ! Yes . Wait ! Damn ! They went in here ; I will pursue them ! Watch out , dangerous ! Are you alright ? Remain here and monitor matters . I will go . The wound hurts again . They are close , very close ! Damn ! How will we know their secret ? How did they take notice of us ? The Saucer Beasts Duz Duz monitor and wait on the ground . I notice that you were giving instructions to the sauce beasts ? ! Duke Fleed ! Oh , I ... it is you ! I see , you killed him ! DIE ! DIE ! I will not let you escape ! Wait ! What an accursed devil you are ... OH ! BROTHER ! BROTHER ! BROTHER ! BROTHER ! Who killed my brother ? Brother ! It is you ! You are the one killed my bro ...

Double Missile ! Grendizer Go ! Hold on , Hikaru ! Duke is coming ! Marine Cutter ! They are gone ! Kouji , what happened ? They suddenly disappeared ! They are three beasts ! Return to The Research Center and guard over there . I will look for them . Roger that . That is right ! They will do what I want . I will avenge for the death of my brother . Here he comes ! He killed my brother ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Alright ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Double Harken ! Dizer Punch ! Double Harken ! Anti-G gravity Storm ! Let 's Fight ! Spazer Go ! Dizer Jump ! Space Thunder ! The one killed my brother is a man from Planet Vega ? Yes . Duke Fleed fights for justice against the evil ones . What should I do ? I must apologize to him . Come on , hurry , he is waiting you . Thank you . Thank you Daisuke , take this . Alright , thank you all so much ! Take good care of yourself , Midori . I will accompany her to the station . Farewell ! Farewell , Midori ! UFO . UFO . UFO Rob Grenadier : Episode Forty Five . Burn , Drill Spazer ! I made some good work . That is right . Anyway , I look forward to monitoring at night . Hmm , what is this ? I did all that on my own . Eh , what an amazing water gun ! Water gun ? Know that this is a telescope ! Even though it doesn 't magnify a lot , it will help me when monitoring our enemies ' invasion . I will join the observation from tonight . Goro , imagine yourself monitoring all night without sleep . I don 't think you can do that . Listen to me everyone . It is time for training . Get going . Understood . Why ? Th ... This is very bad ! I know that I am a child , but there is no need to keep me out in the cold . Oh , something shined ! Perhaps it is ... Eh ! You saw a meteor from Planet Vega ? Definitely ! Something shined and disappeared in the west and east at each edge . Hm , don 't get too excited . There is nothing weird about meteors falling on Earth . - But I am certain that it is from Planet Vega ! - Goro ! We did not receive any information from the observation staff at the base . Goro you alone insist that it is from Planet Vega . Say your claim with responsibility . But the color of the light was ... Goro ! Do you want me to get angry ? Wait . Let 's hear what Goro has to say first , and then we can judge his statement . You three come to the base 's workshop immediately . Yes . I wonder what is the matter ? Goro , don 't give up . Don 't worry about what others say if you are truly convinced of your opinion . Do you understand me now ? I want you to be like that . I understand you , Daisuke . Alright then . I will see you later . Then , I will see you later . Father , that is ... This is a Drill Spazer weapon . Continue now . A Drill Spazer ? Where is the penetrating part in it ? Be patient . I will explain the matter to you . We fundamentally constructed Drill Spazer for underground battles . When it connects to Grendizer , the drill in the front pushed and becomes penetrating . Like that . I found a rock that is harder than titanium that it broke easily . Rest assured . Amazing ! Its speed in the ground is 9 mach . How can it do that ? These tracks with great speed in the ground . Professor , it is ready to go . Thank you . Why don 't you undergo the test flight ? By the way , Doctor , who will pilot it ? Yes , Kouji , you will pilot it . Eh ! I am very happy ! You may pilot the Double Spazer as well . I will do that with all pleasure ! And this also has the same characteristic as the Double Spazer . Roger that . Alright , I will pilot it ! We will see you from the observation room . Shutter Open ! Dash Up ! Launch immediately ! Drill Spazer Go ! Slow down , you launched at a formidable speed , be careful ! Kouji , begin the second test . Roger that . Very dangerous ! You are scaring us , Kouji ! A wonderful and very fast weapon ! Professor , it is good at ascending straight and flipping . Alright . Undergo the test for the Drill Missile . The location isl 117.7 East ; 54.2 West . Roger that . Alright ! My target is the top of the mountain . Drill Missile ! What a mountain that was burst ! Kouji ! Kouji ! Kouji ! Kouji , what happened ? When I close to the volcano , the Drill Spazer shook and landed . The instruments experienced a disturbance . There is a secret in the volcano . Wait ! What happened ? Someone came close to the mountain . What ? Then their attention was enticed . No , The Vegatron landed it . And the wireless signal scrambled and the picture cannot be seen . And nobody knows that the meteor carries the eggs of the ant of Vega . What a bad smell . Sulfur ! When the Earth 's volcanic sulfur affects the eggs of the ant of Planet Vega , the reaction of the Vegatron rays appears . It is a meteor ! A meteor ! Really ! It is a meteor from Planet Vega . It was shining pale , I saw it ! I understood . We have landed two meteors with the ant eggs in two places . The eggs hatch at the same time . A portion of the ants attacks the garrison of the base . And the rest of the ants attack The Space Science Center . And we use a saucer beast to busy Grendizer . It is time to use the saucer beast . Alright . The Saucer Beast Gudu Gudu , get ready to launch . Pr ... Professor , a UFO can be seen ! What ? 3-7-8 Black ! 3-7-8 Black . A saucer beast is approaching . Daisuke , go right away ! Yes . Hikaru , Marine Spazer must be in Standby position ! Yes . Duke Fleed ' . ! Grendizer Route 2 Gate Open ! Grendizer Go ! There you are . Melt Shower ! Spin Saucer ! Space Thunder ! Wait ! We tricked Grendizer easily ! Don 't worry about what the others say as long as you are convinced of your own opinion . I want you to be like that . I saw a meteor that fell and split into two ! Daisuke believed me ! Uncle ! Uncle Umon ! I would like to tell you something ! Not now , not now . In other time please . I saw it last night ! I saw a meteor shining in a pale way ! Ah , I understood . Return later . You are belittling my opinion because I am a child ! No , I don 't mean that . Hayashi , one moment . Goro is really insistent . Mr. Saeki , replay the night 's recording so we can be sure . Yes . That 's it ! That 's it ! Magnify that light . Yes . It is a small meteor . Its width is 1 meter and it weighs 3.5 tons . Goro . I don 't think it is large enough to hide A saucer beast inside it . You can 't connect with Kouji ? Damn ! What happened ? The sound is gone . Professor ! Professor ! Do you hear me ? Professor , it is me Kouji ! Kouji , what happened ? Eggs of an ant beast ! What ? Eggs of an ant beast ? I am sure they are Planet Vega 's ants . When I fired the cyclone beam on the egg , it hatched . I knew that ! I knew that it was from Planet Vega , just as I guessed . Just as you thought Goro . The small meteor is from Planet Vega . The eggs must have been hidden in it . We have a busy day ahead of us . Return to your stations and monitor everything . Yes . A beast and ants ? Professor , the giant ants began to fire at the public areas . Kouji , stop them while Grendizer arrives . Roger that . Damn ! Where did the hell he went to ? ! Father , what is the matter ? Hurry , to the group . Vega 's ants have arrived . Eh ? A saucer beast and ants as well ? It seems like they are planning something . Go and assist Kouji ! Roger that . Damn ! You came again ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Well done ! Continue ! And what do I do now ? What is wrong ? The eggs of point A hatched early . Who is the st ... Stupid did that ? Kabuto Kouji attacked it with a beam canon . We must send Gudu Gudu to point B to speed up the hatching of the other eggs . There is no alternative . I will send Gudu Gudu to point B right away . Hurry to point B and hatch the eggs of Vega 's ants ! Duke Fleed , are you alright ? Yes , I am alright . Hurry for the connection . Alright . Dizer Jump ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! Drill Missile ! Eh ... What ? It didn 't cause any harm ! Drill Missile ! Duke ! The missile doesn 't harm the ant ! It destroyed something else ! Kouji , aim at the top of the ant 's head . Alright ! Drill Missile ! I understood ! The top of its head is its weak point . And it can 't withstand fire . Alright , I will defeat that ant ! Separation Go ! Double Harken ! Come . Professor , the saucer beast suddenly disappeared ! What ? I fear that other ants will come out from the other location . Did you forget ? The meteor fell splitting into two . I think that the saucer beast went over there . Saeki let me see the video tape again . Daisuke , hurry to mount Hiyoshi ! Mount Hiyoshi ? You mean the one near the base ? Yes that is correct , the enemies tricked us . The ants that you killed are only bait . The other ants will attack the base . Damn you , they easily tricked me ! Hurry and eliminate all of them ! Roger that . Dizer Jump ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! What is that now ? He is now able to drill in the earth and enter into it and fight from it . Huh , Grendizer can do that ? Watch out , it is strong ! Drill Missile ! Dizer Beam ! Separation Go ! Marine Cutter ! Shoulder Boomerang ! Watch out ! An ant came out of the spout ! I will fight it ! Monitor Mount lshiaki ! Understood ! Double Harken ! Kouji , fire the Spark Bomber on the spout of the volcano so it erupts . Eh ? Spark Bomber ? You know that the giant ants are not defeated by the beam , but with fire only ! I understood . I will give it a try . Spark Bomber ! Alright , now return to Mount Hiyoshi to assist Duke Fleed . Roger that . Kouji , some ants entered the ground and will attack the base . We have to do something . Alright , the turn of the Spark Bomber has come . Alright ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! Father . We defeated all the ant beasts ! And all because of the merit of the Drill Spazer , it is excellent ! You are a genius Professor ! All the merit goes back to Mr. Goro alone . Goro opinion made us precede them ! Goro , you insisted on your opinion until the end and this is something great . In other words , you are stubborn like Danbi . No I am not stubborn like my Daddy ! What do you mean ? Don 't get upset . It is only a joke . UFO . UFO . It seems that no one is here . Hmm , it is around midnight Earth time . We started . It is time , give them the signal . Alright , they surfaced . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Forty Six . Sharks Falling From The Sky . They sent me an invitation . Nothing strange about that . Here , read please . Marine Land in Yatohara ? And why did they invite you only , Kouji , huh ? Ah , let 's all go . Daisuke , let 's go . I know that I am one of the important people . We can 't do that , lest a saucer beast comes . Ah , don 't worry . Go ahead and I will stay here . Come on . No Daisuke , we 're not able to go without you . Daisuke we can never do that ! Isn 't that right , Hikaru ? If Daisuke doesn 't go , then I won 't go either ! No ! It won 't be appropriate for me to go alone . Leave Daisuke here . You both have to with me as well . What is the matter , Kouji ? It 's as if you are insisting Hikaru on something . Kouji received an invitation from the Marine Land . Oh , really ? That is wonderful . I don 't want to go to the Marine Land . You don 't want to go ? What is the matter , Daisuke ? Eh ! I said I will stay here , but Hikaru insisted on also staying here with me . Yes . I won 't go unless Daisuke goes . Why don 't you go by yourself , Kouji ? Say - Alright , where is the Marine Land ? In Yatohara , Sir . Oh , Yatohara ? - Hmm , Yatohara ? - Alright , I will go ! I accept . The shark carnival is fun . You said you won 't go . And your going doesn 't concern me . Kouji , take her with you . In 30 minutes , you can return if something happens here . Come on , Yatohara is not far . Eh ! You can go as well , Dasiuke . No . Daisuke must stay here as he says . Why ? Don 't be sad , my dear . Go and don 't miss out on a celebration like this one . That is right , he is right . This is a rare chance and we young people must enjoy it . No , Kouji . Sorry . But if we go , then the old man and Goro will want to accompany us . What ? What is the matter ? Don 't you like this garment ? It is pretty and likeable . What is wrong ? Father ! Do you think that you will go with this garment ? And why not ? What 's the shame in this garmeht ? Isn 't it wonderful ? It ls embroidered . No ! We must solve the garments problem first ! No ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! You think it is inappropriate , eh ? Kouji and Goro , you don 't accept ? Oh , it is really as I thought , no one likes it . Yahoo ! Going to Marine Land ! I wish I could fly ! Oh there are too many girls there and food and everything for free ! And why this slowness , Kouji ? Come on , hurry ! Hurry , Kouji ! - Please leave me , that is dangerous ! - Father , sit down or else you will fall . Don 't address me that way ! I am you father ! Did you forget ? Alright ... I will Sit . Daddy , they say that the celebration includes a shark show . What ? Shark show ? Beautiful ! Beautiful ! Hurry , Kouji ! Come on , hurry ! Uncle Danbi , you want the truth ? You are really tiring me out ! Over there ! Ah , here are the fireworks ! I see . I will go and fill up my stomach with food there . Here is the Marine Land ! It is magnificent ! It is fantastic ! Alright , I will hurry ! Yahoo ! Oh , what a big swimming pool ! This is amazing ! Goro , come on let 's go ! I am coming ! I am jumping ! I feel hunger ! I will eat everything before their arrival . What would you like , Sir ? Is it correct that I can eat here whatever I want for free ? Yes , that is correct . From here , please . Have a seat please . Thank you , you can leave now and I will eat everything . Kabuto Kouji is here . Alright , let 's arrest him . Excuse me Sir . I thank both of you . Now I will begin . Alright ! No Kouji ! Don 't make jokes with me or you will pay the price ! I will revenge from you Kouji ! You will get your punishment Goro ! Let 's do it Kouji . Alright ! Don 't ... Kabuto Kouji , Kabuto Kouji ! Attention please , to the telephone immediately . Who do you think is that ? Maybe Daisuke . He could use this radio to communicate with me . That is right . Anyway , I will answer the phone call . Huh , there it is ! Hello , this is Kouji ... I wonder why Kouji is so late ? Did something happen to him ? Sister , Father has been missing for a while now . Father is missing ? How troublesome he is ! We will wait for him a little , and then we will go to look for him . General Gandal , we arrested Kabuto Kouji according to plan . I see , that is good . Are you sure that nobody noticed that ? Yes , don 't worry . Alright , excellent . Torture Kabuto Kouji until he tells you the place where they hide Grendizer and Duke Fleed . Yes , Sir ! He is too late . I will not wait longer . Goro ! I will go searching for father and Kouji . Yes . Wait , don 't go alone ! That is ... This is the telephone box , I wonder if Kouji is inside ! I think not , but I will have a look inside to make sure . As I thought . Where did he went to ? We must go over there . Eh ! I hate too much ! But not enough I need more . Oh , the food came out from this window ! I will go there myself and look for food inside ! Where did he go ? Damn ! I came to arrest the old man as well . No problem , let him go . He won 't benefit us in anything as long as Kouji Kabuto is our grip . Weird , what is going on ? He said that he came to arrest me . What does that mean ? He said something about Kouji . But I ... I am happy . Oh , it is a restaurant ! I wonder if he is inside ! - I am so full ! I am full of food ! I can 't eat anymore ! - Father ! What is it ? That is you , my dears . You 're late ! I ate everything ! I haven 't left anything behind ! That 's alright , but we haven 't found any trace of Kouji until now . Kouji ! I recall hearing the restaurant waiter saying ... " Arrest Kouji " . What ? They arrested Kouji ? - Are you sure ? Are you sure of what you are saying , Father ? - Leave me Hikaru ; I feel dizziness , leave me please . Father , is that correct ? Say ! Please wait , you 've exhausted me . Yes , it is correct , my dear , they arrested Kouji and I think it was in their intention to detain us as well . I fear that we came to suspicious place ! Sister , what do you mean with this talk of yours ? It seems that some spies from Planet Vega detained Kouji . Let 's change our clothes quickly and go to Dr. Umon . Come on , Father ! You people from Planet Vega . And now , you know . Damn ! What the hell you are planning ? This is your last day on Earth , so there is no problem in telling you . First , you must tell us Grendizr 's secret , then we will take you and the guests as hostages . We will arrest all the swimmers in the pool during the shark celebration and you will see what surprises you . So behave yourself . Then , it is the shark ! Yes , it is a shark robot . And now , it is your turn to talk , you must talk without bothering me . BEGIN ! And who said I was going to talk ? What ? You mean Kouji has been captured ? Yes , that is correct , and this is what I got from my Father 's talk ; and it is all I know . As I thought , then it was the plot of Vegan Forces . And this is the reason for their invitation to Kouji ; the invitation was a trap for him . Hikaru , how many guests were there ? About 500 . What ? Too many people ! Daisuke , go to save them right away from the Marine Land . Kouji must be freed from them before they get anything out of him , come on , hurry ! Understood . Hikaru , go back there and pretend that you don 't know anything , and be very careful , until Daisuke arrives . Yes , I understood . This will make me up . Daddy , enough or you will get a stomach ache . What is this nonsense ? Don 't you know that I am big eater and my stomach is strong ? Look ! Father , Goro ! How careless you two are ! Understand that Kouji is in danger ! Patience my dear . In haste is regret . Hikaru , look over there . He is the one . That is the person who talked about Kouji . Father ... Father , remain here and I will follow him . Wait ! Where are you going ? Kouji must be saved . Hikaru ! Ladies and gentlemen ! We will present to you now our special show ; The Shark Show . But it is dangerous , so please keep as far away as possible . Alright , start now ! You fools , you people of Earth . Heh ! You won 't be able to get Grendizer no matter how many hostages you take . Heh ! There is a terrible saucer beast awaiting all of you below the water . It will come out when the show is over . What ? A terrible saucer beast from Vega , eh ? I will pulverize it with one hand ! What did you say ? I said that your saucer beast has neither power nor strength . Shut up ! You fool ! Hey we have to start now . Yes . You will learn the lesson later . Alright Lets do it now . And now the jumping show ! And now you will see the shark jump through the ring ! And now The Saucer Beast Gari Gari attack ... Hikaru ! Are you alright , Hikaru ? Daisuke ! I arrived at the right time . Daisuke , hurry ! Hurry we have to find refuge for the people . The saucer beast will come out of the pool at any moment . Hurry , we don 't have time . But , put on your clothes first , here you go . Oh , thank you Uncle . Alright , Kouji listen to me . Return with our group while I free the rest of the people . No , let me do the work . Return quickly and send Grendizer . Come on , we don 't have time , Daisuke , hurry ! Alright , I am going . Hikaru , bring my Double Spazer please . Eh ! Your Double Spazer ? I will bring it right away . Kouji , watch the safety of the people ! Alright , be tranquil . Attention please ! Now a juggling show of the shark ! I wonder where the proper button is ? Let me try this one . That is awesome . And now I will try with this one . This one ! That one ! Excellent ! That 's enough . Now , all the sharks will explode ! Duke Fleed ! Grendizer Go ! And finally they came . HURRY ! Spin Drill ! Dizer Go ! Double Harken ! Dizer Jump ! Dizer Kick ! Hand Attack ! Hand Beam ! Hand Beam ! Duke Fleed , I will get the saucer beast at the wing . Roger that . Cyclone Beam ! Double Harken ! Dizer Jump ! KICK ! Space Thunder ! I will go with you to the real Marine Land , Hikaru . Yes Kouji and Daisuke will be with us as well , okay ? UFO . UFO . We started implementing our secret mission . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Forty Seven . The Pond Brings Forth Hellfire . The day is lovely ! Yes it is . Today is the date for me to go out with our group to camp , which is why the day is lovely ... And who was the one worried about the weather last night , Father , huh ? But uh ... I want to say ... is this your maximum speed ? What a bunch of failing youth you are ! Alright , I will increase the speed . Hold on tight , Goro . Okay . Go faster , Daisuke , hurry ! Let 's go with the fastest speed ! Daisuke , do your best ! Don 't let Kouji get ahead of you . Come on ! No , I will never lose ! Daisuke , do your best ! Like that , come on , go ! Don 't let a kid like Kouji beat you . A kid like Kouji ? Damn ! I will show you what the kid can do ! Goro hold me tight , I will go at maximum speed ! Okay . Kouji , there is no need to hurry ! Hey , Kouji ! Don 't be hasty , Kouji ! Damn ! Look who 's the winner ! You are frightening me ! 50 pieces ; the first phase is finished . We shall watch something entertaining from here on . Nothing until now . We are done setting up the tents . You did a good job . But don 't forget my wise supervision . Get out of my way ! Here it is , take it . I wonder , will Kouji return with a good catch ? Damn what a failure ! Strange , Kouji doesn 't seem like he was before . There is the evening star . It seems that everything is going according to plan , Minister Zuril . That is correct . My beautiful capsules , rest until I call you to come out . Enjoy ! Don 't eat a lot ; your stomach will hurt you . The guitar and stars ; what a poetic mix . What the matter with you ? Come on . Alright , I am full now . I should walk a little to help the digestion process . . Hey - - You are here , Goro ? Kouji ... Strange ... What is the strange ? You seem so strange , Kouji . You even rode the bike very recklessly . I am sorry ; I didn 't mean to do that . I don 't know the reason . You really don 't know the reason ? Um , as a matter of fact , no . It is something ambiguous . But somehow it is making me more short-tempered . Maybe I got really wary when I fought the Vegan beasts . I know the reason . What is it ? Kouji ... You love my sister , isn 't that so ? Oh ... WHAT ? Don 't joke ! No , it is not that . Do you mean that I seem strange because I like Hikaru ? That is not true . Kouji , are you mad from me ?

Don 't worry about them . Alright ! This is the undercover Vega Forces . All set Okay ! We succeeded , Minister Zuril . Our ships began landing without being detected by the enemy 's radar . Alright , excellent . Soon we will see the fixed striking of the bombs on The Space Science Center . Are you both alright ? Your driving is reckless . You almost killed us . I am sorry , I go fast without knowing . You are nice and polite . Thank you , you are also cute . Take care of yourself , bye . Bye , and watch out next time . Come on ! I feel so refreshed .

The missiles are heading directly towards our Space Science Center . Declare emergency situation . What happened ? The Space Science Center is being attacked by missiles right now ? They attacked ? We don 't know the source of the attacks until now . Launch with Grendizer in a counter attack immediately . Father ! The enemy is attacking ! Hurry ! I understood . Let 's return quickly ! But where is Kouji ? What ? Kouji ! Kouji ! Kouji , answer immediately ! Kouji ! I will show you now ! We will return and leave him behind for the situation is dangerous . Hurry , come now . Kouji !

Duke Fleed , do you best ... Yes , I am prepared to die ... She is prepared to die ? Hikaru ! Hikaru , wake up . I like your type of girls , Hikaru . Kouji !

Roger that ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! Hikaru , watch out ! Marine Missile ! The location of the missile is underground . Kouji !

Yes , Sir ! Even if it costs me my life . Strike them with our Sauce Beast Dago Dago . Yes , Sir ! The Space Science Center will become dust ! Launch the disturbing electric waves . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Forty Eight . Devils From The Depth of The Earth . It seems like a mudslide happened here because of yesterday 's rain . Maybe , it could be . Oh , look at the Jeep ! It is moving by itself ! The engine isn 't running , is that possible ? Let 's go and stop it . It is ... earthquake ... Help ! Someone help us please ! What is happening here ? Professor , a letter from the Meteorology Department . What does it say ? There 's been a shift in the Earth 's crust . Has there been any abnormality in space ? Abnormality ? Yes . According to the reports , abnormal things are always happening . Such as a Jeep driving uphill by itself . What ? A Jeep driving by itself ? Or that the dam 's metal tower becomes shining and glowing . Shining and glowing ? Father , I wonder if this is from an effect of Vegan saucer beast ? We cannot affirm now , as nothing appeared on the radar . But we must investigate the matter . Then , I must launch with my Drill Spazer immediately ! Yes . Hikaru , must measure the Vegatron activity from the air . Yes . And you , Daisuke , prepare everything and be ready to move immediately . Yes . Let 's begin the work immediately ! Shutter Open ! Dash Up ! Drill Spazer Go ! Marine Spazer Go ! Checkpoint 1 , no Vegatron activity . Take infrared images of the Earth 's subsurface . Roger that . Checkpoint 2 , no changes , no Vegatron activity . I will take picture of the Earth 's inside . Kouji . The third checkpoint is 15 kilometers to the North . Roger that . I will check now . No Vegatron activity . Strange . Alright ! I will go down and investigate myself . I am sure that this is the forest building where the witnesses work . And I will look nearby . Yes please . Roger that . To be honest ... We were very surprised when we saw the Jeep going up the hill . We checked the car afterward and found nothing abnormal . Strange ! What is that sound ? It is the same sound that we had heard ! Hikaru , hurry to the mountain and check it ! Roger that ! Kouji , the Vegatron activity ! Drill Spazer Go ! Oh ! Half of the mountain disappeared ? The Vegatron activity is getting stronger . Weird ! The entire mountain is sinking ! There is no doubt that there 's a secret in the matter . Drill Missile ! Oh , it is the saucer beast ! You finally found us ! Alright take that ! Duke Fleed , come quickly ! Duke Fleed ! Grendizer Go ! Drill Missile ! Marine Missile ! Oh , Grendizer came to save us . And now escape , saucer beast , if you can ! Duke Fleed , we will connect now ! Shot In ! Dizer Go ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! Beware , Kouji . The saucer beast may set up a trap for us . I know , don 't worry . Leave the matter to my Drill Spazer . Kouji , what happened ? I can 't move , it is as if I am sinking in a poisonous swamp . And the engine 's radiator is not working ! There is no thrust power whatsoever ! Damn it ! This is Hidoro 's Black Pit . The Hidoro 's Black Pit can cause acidity and halt The Drill Spazer ability . Get out of here quickly ! Alright , I will use full power of the jet power ! What is that ? This is your grave Grendizer ! Hurry ! The saucer beast will pull us to the bottom if it warps itself around us ! Damn ! I can 't maintain balance ! HIKARU ! HIKARU ! Drop the anchor ! Lift us with your Marine Spazer ! Roger that . Anchor Move ! Escape if you can . But I will pull you to the bottom and silence you for good ! Alright ! Pull now ! Continue , with all its power ! Do your best ! Energy Full Power ! What you are doing ? ! You succeed in dragging Grendizer into Hidoro 's Black Pit , and yet you fail to grab him while he is there ? ! I hope for your pardon , General Gandal . We shall make the entire Space Science Center sink inside the ground . We will not fail this time ! Yes , my leader . Eh ... What ? An earthquake , hide ... - Help , please God I haven 't lived long enough ... - Daddy , don 't move the table , please don 't , the pates will fall ! Help me Goro , please ! Goro , help ... Oh , Daddy ! How funny your appearance is ! A pot on my head ... EARTHQUAKE ! Father , our enemy is causing quakes and melting the ground like lava with Hidoro 's . I noticed during my reconnaissance flight that if you draw a line that connect all of the dots registered epicenters , you would get half a circle . What ? You will see now . Look . I see , it seems to me that our enemy is trying surrounding us . There is no doubt that you are good at monitoring ! Professor , I just received the report regarding the shift in the Earth 's crust . And where is the location ? Fomotomashi . Alright , switch on the light of that location . Yes . As we thought . Professor , the infrared photos are ready . Good . Display them on the screen . Yes . I will begin with the first checkpoint . Alright , show us . That is terrible . Huh ! What is that ? I believe that this is Hidoro 's Pit where you two sunk . The enemy is executing a procedure to bring down the Base in a large swamp of lava . And they are digging the ground around us and melting it to a liquid . They must be stopped immediately or else they will accomplish their mission ! Alright . Now hurry to Fomotomashi . Yes . Yes . Come on , let 's go , escape now ! Daddy , Faster I am not able to do so . This horse insists on being slow . Hurry or I will kill you , stupid . Come on move ... Oh , watch out ! He is going to kill me ! Calm down ! Calm down ! You stupid calm do ... Look at yourself ! I am so ashamed ... Minifo squad , go ! Professor ! A Minifo squad is approaching ! What ? Ready the telescope ! Duke Fleed , destroy the Minifo squad first . Roger that . Kouji , it is the Vegatron activity again ! Alright ! Drill Missile ! There is the saucer beast as we expected . Hikaru , let 's tempt it to come out . Roger that . Marine Missile ! Duke Fleed , hurry up and save us . How dare you come , Minifo ? Melt Shower ! Hand Beam ! Spin Saucer ! Space Thunder ! Escape if you can . Space Thunder ! Hikaru , Cut the saucer beasts body with your Marine Cutter , during which I will try to make myself bait to attract it . Roger that . Marine Cutter ! No , I won 't let you do that ! Spark Bomber ! I did it ! You are no match for me , kid ! Huh ! Grendizer ! Duke Fleed ! Destroy him for me . Wait saucer beast ! Spin Saucer ! Duke Fleed ! Come , Grendizer ! Screw Punch ! Melt Shower ! Dizer Go ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Kouji , get him while he is in the air ! Drill Missile ! Hand Beam ! How do we beat this devil ? Now you can move , Grendizer ! I will paralyze you later ! That is correct . Its head controls all parts , and it is done by remote control . Alright ! Space Thunder ! Duke , grab onto my Drill Spazer now . I will free you from the liquid . Alright ! I am alright now , Kouji ! Double Harken ! You miserable loser . I will smash you in the air , Grendizer ! Spazer Go ! Dizer Jump ! Duke , what 's up ? I will attack him in air with Double Harken ! Go ! What ... what is that ? Kouji , go and eliminate him now . Alright . And now prepare for the final blow ! Spark Bomber ! Look below . That place almost turned into a huge swamp many times larger than Lake Biwa . Even Makiba Farm and the chain of the Bokuba Mountains barely made it from the tragedy . Nobody will be able to invade the Earth . We must protect its greenery and protect if forever ! UFO . UFO . What is that ? Yes . There must been an error in loading Vegatron bombs in the Saucer Beast Deg Deg . What you are saying ? Oh , The Saucer Beast Deg Deg is not affected when the Vegatron bomb explodes . Return , Saucer Beast Deg Deg ! Wait for orders , don 't start operations ! Return ! Return immediately ! He is gone mad . What ? He is gone mad ; he lost it when the Vegatron bomb went of . What shall we do , Minister Zuril ? It went crazy and there is nothing we can do . I hope that it lands on Earth and does as it wishes . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Forty Nine . I saw My Brother In The Red Sunset . The saucer beast has pushed through the atmosphere . Amazing speed ! Send Grendizer quickly , let 's go ! Duke Fleed ' . ! Walker Standby Okay ! Route 7 Gate Open ! Grendizer Go ! Duke Fleed ' . ! The saucer beast is landing towards The Sea of Japan at a frightening speed ! Roger that . I will be there . Duke Fleed . The saucer beast is attacking the town beside The Sea of Japan . Tell me what they want . I don 't know . They probably want an uninhabited town . A quiet town ? What do they intend for it I wonder ? The saucer beast is heading towards the Japanese mountains . Alright ! Yahoo ! He " ) me ! I won again . You know we can 't beat , Maria ! A beautiful day . I will take a rest now , I can 't move . Ah ... What was that ? Could it be ? Oh ! Grendizer ! Uncle , are you alright ? Uncle , get a hold of yourself , please . ... Grendizer passed from here . That is the protector of the Planet Fleed . What you are saying , Uncle ? What do mean by Grendizer and Planet Fleed ? Tell me . Maria ... Uncle , be brave ... Uncle , please ... Maria ... Forgive me , Uncle . I should have stayed with you . I won 't go on the bike again . I 'll be obedient and do all that you ask of me . I raised you to have a normal life , my child . - I promise you , that I won 't go again ... - This is blood , my child . Huh ? What do you mean ? You can 't , you should sleep . I must confess now . I must talk to you . You are not my niece . Uncle ... You are not from the inhabitants of Earth . What you are saying ? I don 't like this strange talk . Get a hold of yourself , Uncle . The necklace is the proof . You are the daughter of the Planet Fleed 's ruler . The Planet Fleed ? It is that beautiful planet in the sky . It is peaceful and rich in greenery . The beautiful Planet Fleed ... But ... The Planet Fleed was destroyed by invading soldiers from the horrible Planet Vega . Poor Planet Fleed ... Great Fleed ... His wife ... But and Duke Fleed the prince all died . I took you in my arms , my dear . And I barely made it ... Then I landed on Earth ... I am the Lady of Planet Fleed ? That is right ... you are Grace Maria Fleed ... Grace Maria Fleed ? My father , my mother and my brother left this world ? Spin Saucer ! Spin Drill ! Space Thunder ! Damn you ! That is right . My pain is aggravated by Vegatron beams . Alright ! It is the time , now destroy Grendizer ! What the hell you are doing ? Destroy him ! It can 't do that , it is mad ! Ah ... we almost accomplished that ! Double Spazer Go ! Marine Spazer Go ! But ... But , why did he confess now that I am the Lady of Planet Fleed ? It is Grendizer ... Grendizer ! A flying saucer ? No , not an ordinary saucer . Grendizer is special . The protector of Planet Fleed . The protector of Planet Fleed ? Everyone on Planet Fleed is gone . There 's no doubt that the one in Grendizer now is the demon of Planet Vega that destroyed Planet Fleed . And I hope that you can get back Grendizer from the control of that demon . Even if I tried it flew far away . By using the necklace . The necklace ? When the necklace gets close to Grendizer it will let you know the place . Really ? Yes , you can . Please save our protector Grendizer from the hand of our enemy . Please , Grace Maria Fleed ... Uncle ! Uncle ! Uncle ... Uncle ! I searched everywhere . Where did Duke go I wonder ? He must have had an emergency landing on a mountain close to us . Let 's search for him again . Alright . Uncle ... I thank you greatly for raising me ... I am Grace Maria Fleed . And I will definitely get back Grendizer from that demon ! Huh ? He is over there ! Duke ! Duke Fleed ! Duke , are you alright ? What is wrong Duke ? Get hold of yourself . I am alright . Sorry for putting you through all this trouble to search for me . I will chase those Vegan demons who took over the protector of Planet Fleed till the end . Where did that damned beast go ? Duke Fleed , that saucer beast has surfaced at the Pacific Ocean 's Beach . The industrial plants are under attack ! Alright , let 's go now ! After you . Damn ! It 's become troublesome as you can see . So do I shut up and do nothing about it ? Wait , Kouji ! Cyclone Beam ! Kouji , it is dangerous ! Return now ! Kouji , are you alright ? I don 't know what happened ? But it 's some sort of shock ! It is equipped with powerful Vegatron beams in its armor . You can 't fight it face to face . If only I was able to deactivate those beams . It will become more troublesome if we don 't beat if quickly . That is correct . Let 's drag it toward the ground , and then we will control its movements . Hey , Kouji ! Your mission is the Drill Spazer . As for me , I will use this ! I got that . Space Thunder ! Marine Missile ! Spin Drill ! Marine Beam ! Drill Spazer Go ! I understood ! He is very strong because of the Vegatron beams . Duke ... Kouji returned ! Alright ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! Marine Missile ! Kouji , now ! Drill Missile ! Separation Go ! Space Thunder ! Screw Crusher ! Double Harken ! We did it ! You know ? if we had a friend to send with the Drill Spazer earlier on , then we would 've been able to defeat it quickly ... Grendizer is around here . And finally , I discovered the demons ' castle . Huh ! Who are you ? Watch out ! You are too pretty to be one of them . I will fight you ! Now Demons ! Wait . From where did you get this necklace ? Tell me ! Who are you ? ! I am the daughter of the Great Fleed : Grace Maria Fleed ! Grendizer ... I came here to take it back ... You said your name is ... Maria ? ! Shut up ! Maria ! That is correct . I am Duke Fleed ... Duke Fleed ... ? BROTHER ! BROTHER ... Forgive me , Maria ... Brother ... The Grendizer ... Brother ! Brother ... My brother ... You are alive ? You are my brother ? ! Yes . My brother , you are alive ? Maria . Brother ... Maria , I am pleased that you are alive . I know how much you suffered . But I will be by your side from now on . Everyone , what is happening here ? Duke ... as you can see ... The Duke that you see ... You know ? I can 't describe that ... You can ask the setting sun . The setting sun ? UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Fifty . Eliminate Kouji Kabuto . Outstanding , Maria ! it didn 't occur to me that you are a skillful motorist . Behave like a man , Kouji . Don 't try to fool me . What do you mean with that ? I requested from you to race me , right ? Yes that is right . Be more serious . You are slowing down in order to fool me . No , that is not true ! Or maybe you knew that you can 't compete with me so you tried to hide you inability by flattering me . You 've put my hopes down , Kouji Kabuto . That demon ! I tried to be easy on her because she 's Daisuke 's sister , but now I will teach her a lesson she will never forget ! It is mandatory that we race up to The Space Science Center . Alright ! Let 's do it and see ! Alright ! I will surprise her now ! She will be amazed ! Gather yourself together , Kouji ! I fell ! Maria , watch out ! You should really be proud of yourself . Thank you . Thanks for the real race . You drew me into it . Sorry , but you won . No , I was driven into it . I am the loser . I told you I was drawn into it . I said I am the loser . Drawn into it ! I am the loser ! But I prefer to keep Maria away from the team . But Maria is from Planet Fleed as you know . And she is fourteen years of age . Fighting the Allied Vegan Forces is a mission , and this obligation falls upon Maria 's shoulder and mine . I fear that Maria ... Maria in addition to Kouji and Hikaru are three enough for the Spazers . Correct , but ... Please , allow Maria to join the team . Alright ... Are you ready to move ? Calm down and get ready , Maria . Don 't worry ; I know exactly what I am doing . Shall we start ? On your signal . Get ready , Maria ! Okay ! Simulator Switch On ! Alright ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! - We done ! You did it Maria ! - Outstanding Maria ! You succeeded , Maria , from the first attempt , I failed many times . I am not like you . I am Maria Grace Fleed . Maria ! Don 't be arrogant with your first success . What concerns me is continuous success . Hikaru has become very successful in combat . Understood ? ! Yes . My brother isn 't dazzled by wonder . Another time ! Yes . She is magnificent ! That is right . Daisuke has every right to be proud of her . The Grendizer Team has now been formed ! Hmm ... These three machines serve Grendizer . Grendizer and them must be eliminated by any means . The best way to destroy The Space Science Center but this mission takes long time . We shouldn 't waste time . Let 's mobilize quickly ! The only way is to get rid of the three pilots there . Truly that is correct . You mean Kouji Kabuto and that clumsy Hikaru . Let forget the clumsy one . If we get rid of Kouji Kabuto , Grendizer 's power will go down by half . Let 's mobilize and assassinate Kouji Kabuto . I will select the assassins . You three ! There is nothing more important than assassinating ... Listen . Launch right away and make sure you eliminate Kouji Kabuto , understood ? Yes ! A horse race ? We bring horses from a nearby area and we perform a race every fall . ! How spectacular ! This year the race will be here in Shirakaba Farm . We have to win ! Will Kouji participate in the race on that horse ? Yes . A fabulous horse . His name is Dibashiro . But ... Kouji worries me , he will be alright ? Don 't worry , don 't worry . Kouji 's spirits are very high . Hey Kouji ! Continue till the end and win ! Hurry ! That is right ! Dibashiro is a fast horse ! He will win the race for sure ! The race is definitely dangerous ! Uncle ... I want to participate in this race . What ? Ride the horse ? I have never ridden a horse in my life but I will try . No , the time is not appropriate for experiments . Tomorrow is the race . Uncle please , I wish to participate in the race . I will exert my effort . Ah ... alright . Winning is not the important thing in the race but participating in it . Come with me ... - Wait ! Wait ! Put me down ! Please put me down ! Come on ... - Uncle , how much I love you ! From here you can pick a horse from these ! That one ! Strange ! That mare comes in second to Dibashiro . What is her name ? Her name is Wakaba . Wakaba ! She really amazes me . I like you . Wakaba , don 't be hard on me . Well done , well done . Don 't be scared of her rather befriend her . Uncle , shall I make her run ? No , not now it is too early for running . A short trip only . Alright , only a short trip . Let 's go ! Huh ! What a terrific girl . She knows what she wants ! How wonderful horseback riding is ! A starter and with this skills ? What a smart girl ! Hey , Maria ! Maria ! You are good at horseback riding ! I will participate in tomorrow 's race . Really ? Then our appointment is tomorrow . Alright ! Huh ? ! It is raining ! The rain will come down harder . Let 's return . Land at low altitude to avoid the enemy 's radar quickly . Roger that . The three of us infiltrated safely . Alright . Begin the work immediately , and when you eliminate Kouji Kabuto we will wrestle Grendizer until we eliminate him . The Saucer Beast Fubi Fubi is ready to launch at any time ! I hope it is nice out tomorrow . Don 't worry ; the weather will be nice in the morning according to the forecast . I wish you success tomorrow , Kouji . I am sure of my victory . Don 't forget that I will win . Your winning is far-fetched . Why ? You only started training today , did you forget ? Is that right ? That is right . Impossible ! Maria in reality is an awesome girl . It is unbelievable that a beginner like her rides like that . Daisuke , are all girls on Planet Fleed like her ? Not all girls are like her , Uncle . Have the milk . And this is the toast . Maria , how did you know ? What is it ? How did you know that Daisuke wanted milk and that Kouji wanted toast , huh ? And what is strange about that ? Neither Kouji nor Daisuke said anything , yet you knew what was in their minds . How did you do that ? Yeah , how did you know ? They didn 't say anything ? How did I know ? Alright , it is still raining , and she will race tomorrow , she is a great rider . So why don 't you stay at my house for the night ? Kouji Kabuto will spend the night in this house , and he won 't go to The Space Science Center . A good chance for us ; let 's attack now ! Let 's attack . Get ready for the attack girls ! Watch out ! Why are you trying to kill me ? Wait ! Is the fighting over ? Yes , Maria . Thank you , you saved us with your warning . We crept up stealthily like ghosts . By the way , how did you know about their coming Maria ? I didn 't know . Did you two know ? Kouji Kabuto will ride that horse . Where is the saddle ? It is over there ! Is it true that someone is trying to kill Kouji ? Yes , I advised him not to participate in the race , but he insisted and said he will fool them . But where are the perpetrators ? I don 't see any strangers . Everyone is from nearby farms and cowboys . I will press it at the start . Then after two minutes ... Get ready ! Start ! DO YOUR BEST ! BOTH OF YOU ! Oh my God ! KOUJI ! KOUJI ! KOUJI ! HEY ! DON 'T LET US DOWN ! KOUJI ! KOUJI ! KOUJI ! Kouji ! Kouji , get a hold of yourself ! Kouji , get a hold of yourself . DANGEROUS ! VEGAN GIRLS ! WAIT ! Send the saucer beast quickly , come on immediately ! Saucer Beast Fubi Fubi , attack the Earth immediately ! The scoundrel people of Vega ... It is the saucer beast . Grendizer , attack immediately ! I will handle them ! I am sorry ... Grendizer Standby Okay ! Route 4 Okay ! Route 4 Gate Open ! Grendizer Go ! Please ... attack with ... Double Spazer ... in my ... place ... Hikaru ... for me ... Will do . Good ... luck ... Kouji asked that of me ! I will go myself ! What a girl you are , Maria ! Double Spazer Go ! Alright ! Alright ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Double Harken ! Damn ! Oh , it is Hikaru ! Don 't you think of anyone other than Hikaru ? Cyclone Beam ! Alright ! Dizer Jump ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! Brother get him ! Alright ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Let 's Fight ! Come ! Damn ! Dizer Jump ! Screw Punch ! Brother ... did you see my skills ? Maria , remember that our main mission is to preserve peace on the Earth . Let 's go now . One out of hundreds of girls in Planet Fleed knows things before they happen . I mean the ability to predict incidents before they happen . Hmm , of course it doesn 't always work but it is at least the vision ( Sixth ) sense . Awesome girl ! Your ability is wonderful , Maria ! Forget it you two ! I hate it ! I am an ordinary girl . No , this ability doesn 't concern me . I only want to be an ordinary girl , right Wakaba ? You understand me Wakaba . You understand why I feel like crying ? UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Fifty One . The Enormous Proximity . Defense Minister ! Defense Minister ! My Lord Vega Daio , we must allocate the underground shelters . What happened ? Yes . A star in Vega 's orbit is going off due to Vegatron radioactive contamination . What ? Vegatron contamination ? Yes . The rapid development caused the contamination . Be quiet ! The basters ! Even the forces of nature in the universe are envious of my talents and want to destroy me ! Never ! it will never happen ! We will beam the dead star off to the Planet Earth ! The Earth Planet ? Vegatron activities have increased in the contaminated star . If the oxygen in the Earth 's atmosphere touches it , then abnormal explosions will take place , which could lead to human extinction . Yes . I will launch the beam right away . It is moving ! Alright , Star Vega X3 has moved to the Earth . The Earth shall be in my grasp . And now go ! GO and kill all humans on Earth ! Yeah , that is true ... We have plenty of fresh milk in Shirkaba farm . Drink as much as you like without hesitation . And now , Maria . Thank you . Oh ! What are you doing ? I didn 't do anything . It is the wind spilled it . What is that ? Oh what a gusty wind ! What ... What ? What is this ? Goro what the hell you are doing ? ! I don 't understand what happened . Look how strong wind is ! Wait ! Wait ! Don 't fly my hat ! Wait ! Strange . The weather forecast didn 't predict a thunderstorm . Father ! What is happening ? I don 't know the details yet . Return to the base immediately . I understood . Let 's go . Yes . I will come to help you later , Goro . Never mind , don 't worry ; I will take care of it myself . Alright . See you later . Hey , hat ! Please wait ! Wait , please wait ! Don 't leave ! She is beautiful ! There it is , Uncle . Here you go . Thank you . Maria . Maria ! Maria , what are you doing ? Come on , hurry ! Okay , wait me ! How nice this is . She is really kind . - That is right ! Goro , come one let 's close the stable ! - Yes , Daddy . Father , what is happening ? I am still trying to find out what is going on . I haven 't found a reason yet . Professor ! An abnormal gravitation from outer space is causing the wind 's jet stream on Earth to change . What ? An abnormal gravitation from space ? Yamada ... Prepare the telescope immediately . Yes . It is ready . Alright . What is that ? I have never seen this star before . This star is not from our galaxy . This is the purple star from Vega 's orbit , Father . What ? A star from Vega 's orbit ? It looks like coal . Yes . It is the dark star that was contaminated by radioactive Vegatron . That 's what I think . A dark star ? That is , it is a dead star . Alright . Let 's analyze it with the beam waves . Hmm , strange , nothing alive ... This means ... It is radioactive Vegatron mineral waste . Yamada , on what path is it ? Yes ! It is heading directly to Earth ! WHAT ? To the Earth ? ! And if it was headed to Earth ... ? Once it enters the atmosphere it will cause a massive explosion . At which time it may cause hundreds of cyclones and thousands of hurricanes . It will create the biggest storm that no human can imagine . Professor , how can we avoid such a tragedy ? By blowing it up before it reaches the Earth 's atmosphere . Oh , a star that 's one and a half time the size of the moon ! One and a halftime size of the moon ... I know . Since it was contaminated with Vegatron radioactivity , this caused it to collapse and turned into waste . Or light weight rocks . Waste or light weight rocks ? And it contains Vegatron which can be blown up with a directed rocket . But ... What is the obstacle ? Our rockets can be launched at the dark star without getting detected by the Allied Vegan Forces . Grendizer will help in any way . The Earth 's destiny depends on this operation . Get ready to launch immediately . Yes . The dark star Vega X3 must enter Earth 's atmosphere . Then the massive explosion will take place and all humanity will cease to exist on Earth . This really turns our tragedy to good luck . I am really impressed with your remarkable plan Great Vega Daio . The question is how the enemy will try to stop the operation ! Surely they will send Grendizer to change the course of the dark star . This is a very obvious plan . They must have another one . No , don 't be stupid ! The Earthlings are terrified and scared . Yes , but ... It is the alarm ! Look ! This is Grendizer coming as I told you ! Destroy him ! Yes ! Alright ! Don 't let them get out of the atmosphere even for a moment ! Commander Garilla , get ready to fight ! The Saucer Beast Gari Gari , launch immediately ! They came to stop us as I expected . I am Commander Garilla . I can see Grendizer . Bring them down ! At least stop them before the dark star enters the atmosphere , let 's go ! Roger that . Spin Saucer ! How is that ? You bastard ! Space Thunder ! Blast you ! Alright , come ! The saucer beast intercepted Grendizer with its own body . Go help Grendizer right away ! Roger that . Let 's go ! Launching Okay ! Drill Spazer Go ! Don 't take off before I do ! Follow me if you want . Damn ! Double Spazer Go ! Marine Spazer Go ! Maria ! Don 't fly randomly out of the formation ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! I am all yours ; to the battle ! Hand Beam ! Alright , NOW ! The Electric Grab ! What the hell is this attack ? ! Huh ! Brother ! Wait ! If we attack him now we will harm Grendizer ! What should we do then ? Duke ! Duke ! Can you get free ?

Let 's hurry . Duke ! Hurry ! Duke ! General Gandal , you will be severely hurt once the dark star enters the Earth 's atmosphere and blows up . Return now immediately !

Double Harken ! Hikaru , Scramble Attack ! Roger that ! Damn you ! Dizer Jump ! Cyclone Beam ! Marine Cutter ! Father , what about the missiles ? The missiles will not benefit us , their speed is slow . Heh ? We 're late ? There 's one alternative choice left for us . What is it ? It is that Grendizer carries the missile at maximum speed and full power . Alright , I will do it . Launch it now . I am ready . But the energy needed to stop the dark puts us in an extremely critical condition . I will manage it . There is no time to think . The Earth 's destiny depends on us now ! We have to make a move immediately or it will be destroyed . Father ! Alright ! Missile , ready to launch ! Missile Launch ! Spazer Go ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! Full Power Go !

Roger that . There he is ! What happened ? What went wrong ? The enemy launched a nuclear explosion despite all of our expectations . Missile ? ! What happened to Grendizer ? Their trick was to divert our attention to the wrong way . What a tragedy ! IDIOTS ! How did you lose again ? Now our planet Vega has been eliminated . We shouldn 't waste a moment ! Strike Grendizer and being invasion of the Earth ! Yes , Sir ! Oh ! He is over there ! Go to him , Hikaru ! Roger that . Diving Go ! Duke ! Duke ! Duke ! Answer me ! Duke !

Yes , you are absolutely right . UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Fifty Two . The Exodus of The Army of Vega Daio . Zeta number 4 , a moon in the orbit of Planet Vega , and it is an important resource of Veganium Alloy . And Zeta number 4 provides Planet Vega with most of the energy that it requires . What has caused you to be in haste , Soldier ? Yes , Sir ... An occurrence of an explosion took place in the Vegatron mine in Zeta number 4 ! What ? An explosion in the Vegatron mine ? The Great Vega Daio . And the successive quakes caused explosions in all mines ! What you are saying ? A terrible tragedy that shouldn 't have happened whatever the justification ! Defense Minister Dantus ! Isn 't there a way to stop the explosions on Zeta 4 ? With great regret , no , Great Vega . There 's no way even if we summon the help of the most advanced science in Planet Vega . The Great Vega Daio . In a short while the radiant Vegatron particles will descend ! Please head for the underground shelter . The particles will eliminate life on Planet Vega ! Not a living thin will live on its surface ! He " ) me ! The fog enriched with radiation encompassed Planet Vega ! Life has ended on its surface ! We lost the sources of energy . There is no hope for our salvation unless we mobilize all of our forces and headed in a massive invasion towards the Earth ! This is our only hope . If we really wanted to invade the Earth then it is incumbent on us to destroy Duke Fleed first . Vega 's beast that we developed will surely guarantee this mission . The mission of eliminating Duke Fleed ! The saucer beast of Minister Zuril is a children 's toy compared to my saucer beast Alright . I announce that the first station of the United Vegan Forces will be Skull Moon Base on our way to invade the Planet Earth as a preface to invade the entire universe ! General Gandal ... It is you Minister Zuril ... Planet Vega has become the planet of death . Life ended on it . We have lost our homeland , but we can 't do anything at the moment . There 's no option for us except invading the Planet Earth with the help of our base . In Skull Moon Base . I heard that Dantus will send in the invasion of Earth what is referred to as Vega 's beast . What a challenger this is to us from Dantus ! Minister Zuril , if we let him to be victorious over Duke Fleed then our pride will be trampled and our measure destroyed . General Gandal , let 's use Domo Domo . The saucer beast that was developed by the minds of our esteemed scholars ! We must take down Duke Fleed before Dantus ls able to transport Vega 's beast to Earth . We must not fail this time in destroying Duke Fleed . We must bring down the measure of Dantus ! Alright , determine the point of transmission at XZ within the range of the earth 's gravity . Yes , Sir ! I determined the location . Alright ! Begin the teleporting of Vega 's Beast King Gori Yes , Sir ! Transportation Switch Set On ! We completed the teleportation operation . We 'll land on the Earth quietly , exactly on Japan , and by using the remote control The ship that is carrying the beast of Vega covered in one second the special distance that requires 3,000 light years from Planet Vega to Planet Earth to reach , and the ship kept on heading quietly and precisely in the direction of Tokyo . Not only that ! But also General Gandal left the Skull Moon Base with the saucer beast to Earth ! Hmm ... They 're locked in on our Space Science Center ! Father . I believe they 're Planet Vega 's Forces ! Daisuke , we will instigate them before they instigate us . Understood ! Tell Kouji and his group immediately . Roger that . Duke Fleed ! Sitting Go ! Alright let 's go now ! Grendizer Go ! Double Spazer Go ! General Gandal , formations of flying objects are approaching us ! What ? Kouji ... Hikaru ... Maria ... The enemy is approaching ! Duke ; let 's attack from the three sides ! Alright , I will direct a frontal shot at them And you Kouji will attack the two wings ! Okay ! We understood ! Alright , let 's go now !

The crowds have disappeared from the sky . Confirm accurately and let 's return now . Uncle is worried and waiting for us now . Maria surpassed me . General Gandal ! You are insulting me ? ! I asked you if this saucer beast was the best of your inventions ! Shut up ! None a word ! Your stupid plans are what failed us ! But let 's not differ . Let 's unite our power for the sake of Skull Moon Base . Correct . We have to overcome Duke Fleed quickly ! Alright , I will summon the strongest saucer beast ! Yes and quickly ! We have to destroy Duke Fleed ! Destroy him ! Look at this weapon , Great Vega Daio . This is the best robot of Vega and it has two advantages . The aggression of fighting and equipped with and electronic mind ! Grendizer is insignificant before this beast of Vega ! The King Gori is close to Tokyo now . At that time , Grendizer will face its ill fate ! Great Vega Daio . I have news ! What is it ? A report was received that states that chaos has stricken the Vegatron mines underground . What ? ! And the entire area will explode within hours ! Great Vega Daio , the time has come for us to leave Planet Vega . To the flagship . Alright , I understood ! ESCAPE ! Let us board on the ship ! Yes please let us on ! Please don 't leave us behind ! Are you going to leave us to face our destiny ? At least take our children ! There is no place for you , people ! If you come any close , I will kill you ! Soldiers , to the ship immediately ! Soldiers , to the ship immediately ! We are ready for launching at any time . Alright , Prepare the King Vego . Yes . King Vego Launch ! Farewell , my beloved Planet Vega ... Planet Vega is about to explode ! Get ready to do the transportation operation immediately ! Yes , Sir ! All done now . Alright , Transportation Begin ! Yes . Transportation Switch Set On ! The Great Vega Daio is arriving ! Prepare to salute him ! Yes , Sir ! What is that ? I don 't know ! Look , this is Tokyo ! A mysterious capsule has landed quietly on ground . I am not sure of its nature yet . Maybe it is subservient to the United Vegan Forces . Get ready for the situation immediately ! Yes ! It is a great honor for us to receive you at Skull Moon Base . Did you destroy Grendizer ? Not yet ... He couldn 't . What do you mean ? ! Your saucer beast isn 't as strong as Grendizer ! You say that ? ! You want a prove ? Go ahead and face King Gori the Vegan beast . The criterion is here ! There is the capsule that we are looking for . What beast is that ? What powers he have ? ! I think it is a fight between the new robots of the United Vegan Forces . Alright ! Let 's strike from the four sides ! Marine Missile ! HIKARU ! Dizer Go ! And this way he faces a new saucer beast King Gori and the challenges , that he devoted himself to face , increase before him . Grendizer has proven , time and time again , his ability to repulse the evil invasions , that don 't stop . Fight them till the end , Duke Fleed ! Do your best Kouji ! Help Hikaru ! STRIKE THEM GRENDIZER ! UFO . UFO . Planet Vega approached its end after it became polluted with radioactivity . Due to that , Great Vega Daio created a squadron and moved to Skull Moon Base . And the Vegan beast that the Great Vega brought to the base , called King Gori , was much stronger than the other saucer beasts . And that is King Gori ! UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Fifty Three . Mortal Combat With King Gori . HELP ME ! Hikaru , don 't make any noise . Stay quiet and wait for a chance to escape . I understood , but I am scared ! I need to be brave . Hikaru ! Hikaru ! Get a hold of yourself , Duke Fleed ! There is no escape from confronting it again ! No ! I can 't use any weapons ; Hikaru is in the beast grip . Brother , go and help her quickly or else he will kill Hikaru . Daisuke hurry to save me ! Alright ! Kouji ! Take Grendizer to our Laboratory and get his arm fixed immediately ! And I will try to do something here . Huh ? ! What 's the aim of that ? Leave the matter to me . Maria , try to divert the beasts attention away from Hikaru . Understood ! Okay let 's connect now and leave this place . Hikaru ! Hikaru ! I am coming to help you . Get away from the beast . I will try my best . Hikaru ! Stay calm and get a hold of yourself ! Hikaru ! Jump now ... COME ON ! Don 't be afraid ! Come on hurry ! Maria Release the rescue lines ! Rescue Rope Get Down ! Grendizer went to its secret base . Dantus , it is not easy to locate Grendizer 's secret base . Don 't worry at all . King Gori has a superior sense of smell . King Gori could never forget scent of an enemy he fought . So , he will reveal the enemy wherever it hid . And this is what distinguishes King Gori from all of your saucer beasts ! Great Vega Daio , will you allow me to go to the Earth ? To the Earth ? I don 't think we will be able to execute our effective plan from this Skull Moon Base . We will never win as long as we attack from Skull Moon Base . General Gandal ! Minister Zuril ! Yes ! Cooperate with Dantus in his plan of the Earth battle . Dantus will command the mission of this plan as Supreme Commander . Both of you have to assist and back up Commander Dantus in his plan ! But ... ls there any objection ? No ... nothing ... We will execute Dantus ' instructions . Minister Zuril ! Vega 's beasts beat ours , and the rule is for the victorious one . Alright ! Attack right away ! Let 's go ! Why did you agree to work for Dantus ? I can 't stand that ! I want to know the secret of Vega 's beasts ... Then we will see after that . You mean we won 't be taking orders from him ? Trust me . Let 's invade the Space Science Center ! We don 't have to do that ! What do you say ? ! We can strike the Space Science Center without your help ! Grendizer won 't come out even if we attack the Space Science Center from the air , he is undergoing repairs ! Our chance to destroy the Space Science Center ! Leave everything to King Gori . King Gori is able to bring him out of its secret base and destroy it by himself . Don 't be stupid and execute my orders ! I have never taken an order from anyone ! He is trying to stop our attack for his own benefit ! Calm down , General Gandal . Don 't get angry . Grendizer 's weapon won 't be able to overcome this beast . It is a beast like no other ! Every enemy has a weak point . We must find that beat 's weak point , and that requires a lot of patience . Be patient only . Professor Umon ! Vega 's beast is headed straight for our Research Center . Alright . Prepare the space telescope . The giant is coming here ! What a luck ? ! Even though Grendizer is not ready . But how he was able to get here ? This giant is different . It is a wild Gorilla . Perhaps it remembers Grendizer 's scent . Then it is no use hiding in the secret base . Anyway , we need four more hours to repair Grendizer . Our Research Center is in a real danger ! Is there a way to stop the giant 's attack ? Yes , there is ! I said there is a way to stop its attack . What is it ? Tell us how ! A fire attack . We fool the beast by luring it to the fire . I see . A good idea . Animals by nature are afraid of fire . We 'll start building a fence . We will go with them . I hope this plan is successful . Don 't worry . Kouji 's returning , look ! Daisuke ! That giant is pursuing me ! Alright ! Everyone get away from here and hide behind the rocks right away ! Alright ! Let 's hurry . From here . NOW ! Take this ! - Look ! The Giant is not moving ! - Don 't go forward , Father . He will see you ! What you are doing King Gori ? Answer ! Move forward ! It is walking through the fire ! King Gori , don 't fear the fire ! Only move forward . Don 't lean forward ! Alright ! Continue moving forward ! I understand now . King Gori 's instructions go through the computer bracelet . Dantus , you must pay the price ! Uncle Danbi , return to the Space Science Center quickly . But ... There is no way before us except to trick it again . Alright , let 's try to buy more time ! Wait up. you big ugly Giant ! Kouji is in DANGER ! Thank you Maria for saving me . Try to divert the beasts attention away from our Research Center . King Gori , don 't fall for their trick . Stop pursuing them immediately ! Their Space Science Center is 2 kilometers southwest of here . Go and get Grendizer now ! Move immediately ! The giant is headed for our Research Center . Return there before it arrives . The Research Center will be out of commission if the situation continues this way . Grendizer is ready to go ! The repair is complete ! Daisuke ... Yes . Wait . You will surely get killed ! Nobody can ... Damn it ! I can 't take it anymore ! Let 's follow him . Be careful ! Duke Fleed ! Melt Shower ! Space Thunder ! I have to divert the beasts attention away from the Research Center . Hand Beam ! Shutter Open ! Dash Up ! Dizer Go ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Marine Missile ! Spark Bomber ! Duke Fleed , let 's combine and fight the ugly Giant . Alright ! Dizer Jump ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! Launch the Minifo military forces ! Cover King Gori immediately . This is our chance , General Gandal . Launch immediately ! General Gandal , I didn 't order you to go forward . Return to where you were ! RETURN ! Execute my orders or you will be punished ! I will demote you to the rank of soldiers ! Do whatever you want ! Minifo forces are coming , watch out ! Leave it to me . Marine Missile ! Drill Missile ! Marine Cutter ! Spark Bomber ! This is their leader 's ship . They fell into our trap Let 's lead them to Dantus ! Don 't let it get out of our sights . It got away from us ! I am sure that it is hiding nearby . I trust that they will find his ship quickly . There it is ! But it is different than the one we saw before . Leave it to me ! Drill On ! A little more effort and we will win ! You have succeeded , Maria ! I am worried about them . Let 's return back quickly . Roger that . We have to get out of here ! Damn you ! It is so strong to the point that prevents me from moving ! Oh ! Gandal ... Zuril ... We will be able to destroy Grendizer into pieces in less than a second ! What you are doing ? Dantus will die . With bravery in the battle . The remote computer system that operates the beast has malfunctioned ! Destroy the Giant to pieces , Duke Fleed ! Alright , let 's disconnect . Separation Go ! Double Harken ! Double Cutter ! It was a horrific giant ! It sure was . But with everyone help , our victory on this beast has been achieved . Dantus attacked the enemy and died a glorious death in the battlefield . He was a great warrior . We lost a great warrior . Don 't talk about the dead ! General Gandal ! Minister Zuril ! Yes , Sir ! Go to the Earth right away and establish our base to invade Earth . It is difficult for us to plan our operations from the moon . We can 't waste any time ! We understand your wish . UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Fifty Four . Terror in The Depths of The Sea in Japan . We will control all weapons Transport the materials used in war . We need weapons to protect ourselves . Don 't you have faith in our attack forces ? But our enemy is Grendizer . Shut up you pair of idiots ! Yes , Sir ! What a shame of you to dispute . I ordered you to establish our base on Earth with solid cooperation between yourselves . That is right ... If you are not able to follow my orders , then I will remove each of you from their rank and put two others instead of you . Great Vega Daio , please don 't misunderstand us . We are only arguing to achieve perfection . There is no dispute between us . Isn 't that right , Minister Zuril ? Yes that is true ! And as we promised , we will exert the best effort to establish our base on Earth . Alright . Prepare the Saucer Beast Bani Bani for Gandal . Yes , Sir ! This is General Gandal . This is General Gandal . Begin the exhaustion operations immediately . Alright , roger that . Vega 's giant , launch ! A UFO spotted on the screen on 5.8 Black ! The direction Black 5.8 . Oh ! That is a saucer beast from Vega ! A beast from Vega is approaching us . Prepare to attack right away ! Yes ! Wait . There is no need to say that this giant is different from the other Vegan beasts . The Vegan beast is creatures with its own special mind . Don 't forget this matter . Understood , Sir ! The stronger our enemy becomes the more our fighting spirit flares up ! Your comments are somewhat childish , Kouji . Eh What do you mean ? ! Kouji ! Don 't think that this Vegan beast is an easy prey . We 're ignorant of all to do with it . We 're ignorant of how that beast fights . We understood . We 'll be careful . Yes . Alright , let 's go ! Yes ! Duke Fleed ' . ! Sitting Go ! Route 7 Gate Open ! Grendizer Go ! Drill Spazer Go ! Double Spazer Go ! Marine Spazer Go ! There it is . Spin Saucer ! I understand now . The more dangerous the striking the fiercer it becomes ! What a monstrous giant ! Melt Shower ! Hmm ! It truly excels in agility that we haven 't seen in any other saucer beast . Damn ! Just as I thought , it 's not an ordinary beast ! Damn you ... Duke , it seems like a fierce battle is going on between you and the beast . Truly , it is different from the other saucer beasts . Maria ! Don 't worry . Leave the beasts matter to me , I will tear it apart . Come back ! Spark Bomber ! That beast seems smarter than you , Maria ! Shut up ! Damn you ! Get away from that beast quickly or else we won 't be able to attack it ! It is dangerous to attack it from far away . Let 's unite together . Alright ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! Damn you ! WAIT ! Our coordination of the giant is about to be successful . Alright , it is our best chance now ! Minifo , launch ! Marine Marine Spazer ! I can 't I can 't get close ! What ? Drill Missile ! Thank you , Maria . Kouji ! Hikaru and Maria are in serious danger ! Damn that luck ! We have to stop pursuing the Vegan giant . Screw Punch ! Look , they are getting away ! We succeeded ! The exhaustion plan that we followed was successful ! A sea cyclone ! To the left ! MOVE ! The transformation plan was successful . We will cut off contact with you for some time . Over . Alright Grendizer took the bait and fell into the trap ! Hikaru Didn 't you find the beast yet ? No , nothing yet . There is no trace of that beast here . The area is completely still . Kouji ! And you ? Did you find anything ? I can 't find a trace of the beast here . Duke , don 't you think it 's better that we withdraw from here ? No . The beast will appear soon and we must be ready . I will go over there to find it . Wait ! It 's dangerous to perform the work by yourself ! If anything happens to you I will help you . IDIOT ! This is my mission ! I am not an idiot ! How arrogant ! His language is loud and authoritative ! Watch what you say and don 't think we are equal ! Look at yourself first ! How rude you are ! I hate the person who tries to lead like you . Eh ! I am happy to hear that ! Try not to like me or else you will suffer my wrath ! You 're very rude ! Bye bye ! Go and do whatever you want ! Oh ! What I 've done ? Maria ! Where are you headed ? Come back I was joking ! Father . We lost Vega 's giant beast . It got away from our radar as well . I am sure it is hiding at sea bottom or in the ground . Look for it . Do that now . Yes . Professor , Where is Maria now ? She is flying south . Eh ? ! Why did she choose to go there ? Oh , what a beautiful squadron ! This is the brigadier of the National Marine Forces . Get away from the marine training limits immediately ! We will fire bombs . Leave immediately . Sir , we received an SOS from a submarine . Ah What ? SOS signals ? Oh ! Eh What is that ? It is a monster ! What we are doing is not training , not training ! Proceed to the battle immediately ! This is Drill Spazer here ! This is Drill Spazer here . Emergency situation ! Emergency I am scared ... What is the matter , Maria ? Speak , I am listening . Daisuke . Umon here ! We pinpointed the location of Vega 's beast ! The direction is 301 . Roger that . We will go there immediately ! Vega 's beast is heading towards an island with an industrial complex ! Try to Stop it ! We will be there immediately ! Spark Bomber ! BROTHER ! What a stupid giant Vegan saucer . It is really slow ! Hey , don 't get excited ! Where are you now ? Why don 't you come and help me ? I am coming to you . Don 't attack the giant . Vega 's giant will torment me if I don 't do anything . Space Thunder ! What is going on ? I am trying to go and help Maria , but the beast is blocking my way . Alright , try to lure it and I 'll go and help Maria instead of you . I am counting on you . Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Screw Crusher Punch ! It has unexpected energy ! Duke ! Hikaru ! Destroy that tail ! I understood . Marine Cutter ! Duke , are you alright ? Yes . Take care of Maria , please . Alright . Maria . She is unconscious . Alright . I will try CPR . You Pervert ! Eh What do you mean by that ? What were you doing ? Um I was I tried CPR with you because you were unconscious ! Don 't do anything without my permission . Don 't you know that the inhabitants of Fleed regain consciousness just by touching them ? You Pervert ! I didn 't know that . Get out of here ! As you wish . MOVE ! What a girl she is ! Marine Missile ! Duke , please start the connection ! Alright ! Dizer Jump ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! Diving Go ! Oh There it is here . Torpedoes Missile ! And this is another torpedo ! It 's as if Vega 's beast made us come here to escape ! We have to get out of here quickly ! Hiding Move ! Are you alright ? I am alright . There is a base at the sea bottom that fired the missiles at us ! Eh ? ! A base ? Vega tried to fool us to build the base there and for that the beast initiated attacks here and there . That is what I believe . Alright , let 's go ! Oh ! Look there ! It is as you thought , it is the base ! Alright I will turn the beast into wreckage ! Fire at the Vegan beast abdomen so that it ascends to the surface to breathe . Hand Beam ! Marine Missile ! Kouji ! I found the Vega 's beast ! Maria , get out of my way ! Leave that beast to me ! Double Missile ! Spark Bomber ! We did it We succeeded ! Alright , let 's attack the base . Hikaru fire the missiles at the Vegatron tank . Roger that . Marine Missile ! We blasted the sea base . Maria , are you alright ? Yes , I am alright . Did you thank Kouji for helping you ? She did that with her special way ! That is a secret between me and her . Minister Zuril here from the research forces . We reached sea bottom . We will begin establishing the base here . Send the building materials . Roger that . I will bring them to you immediately . UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Fifty Five . The Frightening Air Balloon . There is no better place to establish the base than this one , Great Vega Daio . Yes , its geographical feature makes it easy to defend yet hard to infiltrate . Hurry with the completion of the inside of the base ! Will do without a delay . General Gandal , I will take care of this myself since it 's not an offensive operation . What you are saying ? Gandal ! Yes Sir ... Our goal is to establish a base . Gandal must obey Zuril who will take care of the operation . But ... That is an order ! Yes Sir , I understand . You bastard ! I won 't let Zuril get all the credit . I have to do something . Oh , I have to try again . What is that ? ! Oh my God ! TSUNAMI IS COMING ! TSUNAMI ! Professor , it seems that the industrial marine area was hit by a tsunami ! Tsunami ? And how strong it was ? Yes . We haven 't witnessed one like it before ! The industrial marine area 2A Plus , is almost destroyed . Why ? Didn 't the Meteorology Center announce a warning about that tsunami ? No , nothing at all . That 's strange ! Hayashi . Yes ? Did the radar detect anything that resembles a saucer beast ? No Nothing unusual . Nothing unusual on the space telescope either ! Impossible The Meteorology Center couldn 't detect such large tsunami ! And if it was the result of an earthquake or an underwater volcano eruption , then the shore 's dike would 've repelled it . There 's something mysterious in the matter . A tsunami of unidentified source flooded the industrial marine area and destroyed it ! Did you say a tsunami of unidentified source ? Nobody knows yet . Hikaru , go and investigate the matter in the Marine Spazer . Yes . As for the rest of the group , remain here on standby . Yes ! Standby Okay ! LAUNCH ! Marine Spazer Go ! Eh Damn ! Zuril is ordering me to collect material ! Something happened ! I discovered a spazer on the radar screen . Alright , it came then ! Alright , get ready for the battle ! Wait you shouldn 't attack . General Gandal , it 's a secret operation for our successes . But we can 't retreat ! General Gandal Don 't forget that I am in charge of this operation according to Great Vega Daio 's orders . Damn ! I summoned the Minifo from Skull Moon Base to stir up the enemy . As for you , you should retreat immediately . Alright . I understood . We will retreat right away . Right away . An operation on stir up the enemy ; a golden opportunity for success . A great chance for you . What ? Place the secret weapon on standby . Understood . I won 't let Minister Zuril get all the credit . I shall be the supreme commander of the Marine Base . Professor There 's nothing left in the industrial area . Not even the factory or the gas tank . Why ? Do you mean that even the factory and the tank have disappeared ? Yes I will dive in the water to investigate . Good idea . No wait ! Huh ? A fleet of Midifo is heading towards us ! Grendizer , Double Spazer and Drill Spazer all of you launch immediately . Duke Fleed ' . ! Kouji and Maria , I will launch now ! Grendizer Go ! Double Spazer Go ! Drill Spazer Go ! I must find a way to get out of here . Marine Cutter ! OH ! Hikaru ! Spin Saucer ! Hikaru , are you alright ? Yes , I am alright . Alright , let 's go now ! Missile Launch ! Kouji , watch behind you ! I know , don 't worry . Cyclone Beam ! Do you see , Maria ? This is how the work is done ! Huh ! Look at how he thanks me for my help . I won 't let them escape ! Hand Beam ! Cyclone Beam ! Do you see ? The Midifo is engaging a tough battle because I am not leading . What a great chance ? And now it 's time Launch the secret weapon ! Launch ! Oh , General Gandal ... What 's the matter , Minister Zuril ? What just blinked on the radar screen ? Nothing to worry . Relax . Then , what are you waiting for ? Come on hurry and bring the material right away ! Understood , I will do that now . Gandal intends harm for me . Look ! It 's the National Air Defense Command ! That must be it . I 'll call the command right away . To Eshijo Command ! To Eshijo Command ! The unidentified balloon we 're looking for has been spotted over the Shinano River . I 'll descend and start the operation . Damn them ! This is getting messy . Alright , execute the operation ! Alright . We 've succeeded in the infiltration . Use full power and retreat ! Yes . Begin retreating ! There is a secret in the matter . I will go and investigate again . But the air balloon and the factory are gone , so how are you going to investigate ? We will look for a clue . Hikaru and I are going to search the sea near the industrial area again . Kouji and Maria will investigate the Shinano River where the balloon disappeared . Brother But what is the connection between the air balloon and the tsunami ? I don 't know the answer yet . I feel worried because I still don 't know who was in the air balloon . Let 's go in any case . Alright . Father . Please grant me permission to attack . No I won 't . Father ? ! Professor ! You shouldn 't do anything until matters become clear . If the enemy is setting a trap for us , then the matter is terrible . Wait a little more . What 's the matter , General Gandal ? Nothing at all . You 're hiding something from me , aren 't you ? Ridiculous . Then explain to me slowly The material transfer operation was a complete success . Damn ! I will deal with it once the secret weapon arrives ! Daisuke , what 's up ? He 's thinking about the air balloon and the tsunami . Exactly . I am thinking of what you said . I am so sleepy and tired ... Daddy , look there ! What 's that ? What ? Over there ! Look , look ! What is that ? A large and strange fish ! I will catch it . - Alright , I will catch it like heroes ! - Daddy , the matter seems impossible . Nothing impossible ! Look at me ! I did it ! I got it ! What is happening ? Daddy ! A saucer beast fish ? Daddy ! Hey Goro , are you alright ? What was that ? That 's a saucer beast no doubt ! A saucer beast ? - We must inform Umon of that ! ' Yes. yes ! Hayashi Did you spot anything on the radar ? No , nothing until now . Strange Just as Daisuke said , there 's a secret in the matter . Professor , a telephone call from Danbi . Please inform him that I will call him later . But he says that he saw a saucer beast . What ? He is waiting you to answer the call . Hello , what 's the matter , Danbi ? Yes Doctor , a space beast came out of the river ! Yes from the river ! Did you see it ? Of course I saw it , and Goro is a witness of that ! This river runs through the Shinano River , and Shinano River is the place where the air balloon disappeared ! Doctor , can you hear me ? Can you hear what I said ? Ah Thank you , Danbi , well done ! Everyone , something that resembles Vegan beast is headed in our direction from the river ! Hurry we must take all precautions ! Yes ! Grendizer Go ! Duke , look there it is ! It looks like a shark . It is a Vegan beast no doubt . Kouji , I will connect with Double Spazer right away ! Alright . Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Scramble Turn ! Combination Cross ! Kouji , let 's go ! Okay ! And now launch the Missiles . Double Missile , launch ! It appeared in its true form . It is a beast from Vega as I thought . Nail it ! It 's no use . The Space Science Center dam is on the other end of the river . What is happening to him ? Oh , what is that ? Unlike the rest of the mechanical beasts , this one can enlarge itself . Damn them ! That is what the enemy was after then . Alright ! Hikaru and Maria ! We will deal with the Vegan beast . You monitor the torpedoes ! Roger that . Leave the matter to us ! Dizer Kick ! Damn ! Screw Crusher Punch ! Damn you ! Are you alright , Kouji ? What the hell he is doing ? ! Spark Bomber ! I can 't do anything when they sink in the water . We 'll see when I fire the Marine Missile at them . Marine Missile ! My God ! It 's just like a flying fish ! What torpedoes ! We can 't stop them like this ! Hikaru , they 're going to reach the dam ! Something has to be done ! Duke , please release the grip ! Impossible , there is no use ! I can 't do anything ! At this rate the electric current will be disrupted ! Hikaru , we have to do something right away ! We can 't go on like this ! Alright , then let 's try . Whether we succeed or fail , we have to get free from it ! Let 's try now ! Alright , I am counting on you ! Let 's go ! Dizer Jump ! Scrambling Power Up ! We finally did it . Well done , Duke Fleed ! He is not finished yet . Screw Crusher Punch ! Duke , I am worried about the torpedoes ! Alright , let 's move now . GO ! There is no hope now . The dam will be destroyed ! Hikaru , calm down . You have to fire the Marine Cutter , and when the torpedoes fly , I will direct the Spark Bomber at them . This is the only way left for us to try . Alright , I will try . Maintain my speed . Okay ! You have to aim ; the first torpedo is coming , now ! Okay . Marine Cutter ! Spark Bomber ! We succeeded , Maria ! Hikaru ... Duke , they have done very well . Maria , you were amazing ! What ? You are making fun of us again ! No ! I am not ! Don 't tease Maria . That was an awesome job . Hikaru , thank you . But we can 't overlook this yet . What had occurred indicated that the United Vegan Forces have succeeded in infiltrating to some location on Earth . You 've trespassed the limits , you fool ! Yes but We managed to collect enough material ! IDIOT ! Yes , Sir ! All you had to do was collect material , and now with your attack on the Space Science Center , you revealed our infiltration . Gandal , I won 't allow another mistake ! Yes , Sir ! Minister Zuril ! Yes , Great Vega Daio . Since things have turned out this way , the inside of the base must be completed quickly . And then preparedness for battle ! Yes , Sir ! As you wish . Damn I won 't allow someone like Zuril to beat me . Next time , my attack will succeed ! UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Fifty Six . A Fake Doctor Causes a Crisis . How are things going , Kouji ? No changes yet . This is Hikaru Nothing resembles a base at sea bottom . Roger that . After we realized that the United Vegan Forces were planning on establishing a secret base on Earth .. ... we decided to increase patrol missions . Drill Off ! No change here either . Roger that . It seems that Vegan Forces is worried about our patrol missions . Hmm Let 's focus closely on the sea . What is that rocket is doing here ? Rocket ? What ? Something like that ? It is not disturbing at all . That must be the rocket that the university dispatched for experimental operations . In my opinion , it is nothing but a toy . I see . It has worried me . The card shows you the spectral analysis of the heat beam in case a saucer or a similar ship passes by . It must be from space . Until now there is no evidence that any saucer beast went into the sea . Ahh How is the computer functioning ? It is functioning well . For sure they are afraid despite everything . We can 't be optimistic as they are not the kind of enemies that withdraw easily . Uncle What is this line ? Line ? This is a heat beam reaction ! It became apparent that our suspicion was right . They were doing the work for their secret base . To deceive us , who were doing patrol , the Vegan drilled a tunnel in the mountain and through it , they transported the necessary materials to establish the sea bottom base . We completed the underwater base . And we need thirty minutes to complete the laboratory . Then everything will be ready . How much I wish we can start our surprise attack immediately ! We will attack the Space Science Center . Their base is directly connected at shore in the Sea of Japan through the valley and mountain . That 's their base . As we thought . Alright . Everyone must attack ! You shouldn 't have any room for them to continue establishing their base . Yes . YES . Duke Fleed ' . ! Drill Spazer Go ! Kouji and Maria go to the valley and destroy the tunnel there . As for us , we will destroy the underwater base . Okay . Maria , let 's go now . Roger that . Hikaru , let 's go now . Yes . Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Combination Cross ! OH ! Grendizer ! It is approaching the warehouse ! But how did they discover this secret route ? Damn ! If they attack the warehouse , then it is completion will be delayed ! Danger ! Hikaru Watch out from him ! Marine Missile ! I can 't see anything ! DAMN ! Melt Shower ... oh ! What a power ? ! I can 't move ! Alright , wait and you will see ! Marine Cutter ! Hand Beam ! Marine Missile ! Alright , let 's go back and find the route . Hikaru , we reached our target ! Marine Missile ! Oh ! The water is seeping in ! Let 's hurry The warehouse will drown ! Move . The transportation unit must save what it can of materials ! These materials are very valuable , let 's go ! DAMN IT ! Maria , now ! Double Cutter ! Drill Missile ! He is trying to escape ! Drill On ! Cyclone Beam ! Alright , the material transportation tunnel has been completely destroyed . The warehouse is what remains to be destroyed . Roger that . Get ready to launch an aim ! Marine Missile in Launching Mood ! Launch ! Idiots ! Didn 't I order you not to let anything go by you , no matter how small is it ? Look at that ! Isn 't that the rocket of the University test for unqualified use ? You morons You 've been fooled by Umon ! Our necessary material has been spoiled , and completing the base will be delayed a great deal ! You don 't possess the qualification of leadership ! Great Vega Daio ! Please give me another chance ! We have to complete this underwater base by any means ! I see I will give you another chance , and if its establishment isn 't completed in ten days , I will rethink the matter , understood ? Yes , Sir ! Don 't say anything . I will not be able to forgive that human Umon ! Damn ! But we must destroy their satellite so that we can establish the base ! That is not true General Gandal ! I will get even with Umon ! But Minister Zuril ... Their neck is stiff ! I will overcome them ! I will show you with who you are play , Umon ! Father . You will leave us tomorrow and we will be happy if they decided to launch the tracking satellite in the international conference this time . Dr. Shubyler says that he is in complete agreement with me on the matter I will not leave the conference before the decision is taken . If every country launches a satellite , then the Earth will be monitored by many Then it will be impossible for inhabitants of planets to establish a base . I hope that really happens . Daisuke take care of everything during my absence . Be tranquil and don 't worry , Father . And be extremely careful . As nobody knows where the soldiers of Planet Vega may hide . No need to worry about that . Kouji , Hikaru and Maria All of them will accompany me as guards . Uh You 've made me an unnecessary note . That is right , Daisuke . Now all of you get to bed early . Yes . Good night . Good night . Professor , we will be in Switzerland shortly . I see . I am eager to meet Dr. Shubyler . Oh , the Alps Mountains are really wonderful ! Earth also has a beautiful place like this ? Is Dr. Shubyler home ? Yes Who are you please ? Don 't cause any noise or I will kill you , understood ? Elza , what is the matter ? Elza ! I heard someone come in . Hello , Elza . Dr. Umon . You are always beautiful . Please inform the Doctor that Umon has arrived . The Doctor is now preparing for the conference that he is attending , and he says that he doesn 't want to see anyone . Strange He requested from me to come and see him upon my arrival at Switzerland . I am sorry . But the Doctor is exhausted . Please meet him at the conference room . I see This is a strange matter . Anyway we will see you later then . I am sorry again . The Earth is now subject to threat from the inhabitants of Planet Vega . To protect our Planet Earth , I believe that all nations should unite their efforts to resist the inhabitants of Planet Vega . Let every nation dispatch a satellite to defense the Earth from the invaders and protect it . And we must attach radars with every satellite we send to space . I have a firm belief that it is not an exaggeration that the invasion of Vega could be prevented with these eyes . Umon was with you . Thanks for your time Ladies and Gentlemen . And now addressing you is Dr. Shubyler , the representative of Switzerland ! My position is in complete disagreement with Dr. Umon suggestion . Dr. Shubyler ? ! Really strange . What Dr. Umon is suggesting is to spy on the military condition of every nation in the world . Spying on every nation and gets it secrets which is not acceptable at all ! What are you saying , my teacher ? That need for that is because Dr. Umon wants to conquer the world ! That is a lie ! Desist from this nonsense ! Dr. Umon is plotting with the space men to control the Earth ! This is nonsense ! Dr. Shubyler ! What is your evidence of what you say ? That is right ; Dr. Umon based his suggestion on detailed data . So one what basis are you relying on to be in opposition , Dr. Shublyer ? I agree with your opinion . We are scholars . A mere opinion has no value . Bring forth tangible facts ! What ? Forth tangible facts ? Damn ! Did they come ? It is the Vegan beast ! Hikaru and Maria , hurry ! Yes ! Hurry Grendizer ! Hurry ! Double Cutter ! There is no use of that . HIKARU ! Everyone , quiet please ! Everyone , quiet please ! The Vegan beast is gone . This surprise attack is , with no doubt and for sure by an order of Dr. Umon ! He is a skillful actor ! He conspired with his partners from space in planning to back up his opinion ! Dr. Umon 's greed will surface tomorrow ! Teacher I will not be silent about such an insulting accusation ! Drill Missile ! Double Missile ! Huh ! Brother ! I was waiting for you , Duke Fleed ! Hand Beam ! Wait ! You want to escape ? Hikaru , are you alright ? Thank you , I am alright . You two , we must hurry and not be late ! Let 's go ! I am going . Huh ? ! Look the Midifo unit ! Double Cutter ! Thank you , Hikaru . Hand Beam ! Drill Missile ! Teach please , believe me ! The space monitor is really necessary ! I would like to come forward with two suggestions . One of them is to destroy that spying satellite that Dr. Umon launched this threatens the security in the world and spy on them ! And the other is for you , lovers of Earth . Boycott Umon , the traitor ! Te Teacher , strange is your accusation and your straying from the scholarly approach ! You were in complete agreement with my research ! Umon , you are an excellent scholar but you are extremely ambitious , do you understand ? Alright , no one remains in our way . Kouji Let the four weapons focus an attack on it ! Alright , understood ! Maria , let us connect ! Roger that . Shoot In ! Dizer Go ! Combination Cross ! Maria , aim at the wing . Okay ! NOW ! Double Cutter ! Marine Cutter ! Space Thunder ! What ? You want to destroy the space monitor ? It must be stopped right away ! It is too late now The missiles of the nation defense forces have been launched . That is nonsenses . That is true , my teacher is left-handed . And his smoking pipe was always in his left hand . In addition to that , he had a habit of taking off his glasses and raising them whenever he was tense . And also how was he able to know about Vega 's beast at that time without seeing it ? ! Oh , Teacher ! Elza ! My teacher . Thank you . He was a fake as I thought . I am sorry . But at that time , he threatened me to kill Dr. Shubyler and I feared that he would fulfill his treat ! Umon Let 's summon a new meeting , and every nation should send a space monitor . Teacher I don 't need another testimony now . The space monitor that I launched has been destroyed by the national defense forces . What ? The National Defense forces ? We have to act quickly ! The matter is dangerous ! The matter is dangerous ! I wish I can see Umon 's face . Well done Gandal and Zuril . With the underwater base as a launching point for you the there is no work ahead of you except invading the Earth , understood ? Yes , Sir ! Zuril and Gandal are happy with the disappearance of the space monitor ! The battle will be more fierce , but don 't lose focus , maintain tranquility . Everyone do your best . Yes . Father Let 's launch the second space monitor immediately ! Damn you monsters ! UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Fifty Seven . The Ferocious Beetle .

Believe me ; I saw that with my own eyes ... Kiyoshi , you are here ! Huh Mamma ! What is the matter ? He causes me some troubles , Madam . What did he do ? He confused me as he told me that he saw ten trucks go inside here , and that a police patrol car disappeared . And not too long ago he told me that a UFO came and a space man came and it is a lie . No , I swear I didn 't lie ! You know and trust me , Bodu Bodu . I am so sorry for that . Perhaps he felt lonely because I work until such a late hour . You know we are busy as well . Tell him to stop bothering us from here on . I am sorry , Sir . What I say is correct , and also Bodu Bodu saw it as well . Isn 't that right , Bodu Bodu ? Come one let 's go . Kiyoshi ...

Do as you want , I don 't care ! I am going now . Wait a second ! Kouji , wait me . First , attack Maria as she is alone now . Then attack Kabuto Kouji ! Yes , Sir ! Kouji , left me !

Leave the matter to Kouji . We don 't know what will happen now . Remain here on standby . Yes But I won 't be at ease if Kouji goes by himself . What is that , Maria ? Nothing at all ! Shutter Open ! Dash Up ! Marine Spazer Go ! I 've reached the area of the meteor shower . I will descend in the water to investigate . I will get going now . Be careful , Kouji . Roger that . I didn 't find a meteor at sea bottom . Maybe it burned before crashing . If the matter was only a meteor shower , then there is no danger whatsoever . I will search nearby to make sure of everything . Proceed with the work ! This is the saucer beast Beni Beni , Great Vega Daio 's pride ! Alright Let 's begin Grendizer 's demonic operations !

Why he has done that ? Daisuke Daisuke ... That is impossible ! Brother , I can 't believe that you became a demon ! Daisuke ... Did you really become a demon ? Professor ! What is it ? Professor The national defense forces have been summoned to attack Grendizer right away ! What you are saying ? Daisuke If he really became like this ... Then he must be driven out of Earth with Grendizer ! Don 't believe ! This is terrible ! My brother is a poor fellow , don 't you think that ? What if they reject him into space as a demon ! I have known the kind of harshness that he would get from them ! So I must do something for him before it is to late ... Death is more merciful for him than that ! Damn ! My dear ones Grendizer ! That is enough for now . Grendizer will not be able to remain on Earth from now on . We must success and I will be watching the developments from here ! The magnetic charge has weakened . NOW ! Dizer Full Power ! I finally did it ! Space Thunder ! Spazer Cross ! Where the hell you are , Grendizer ? Duke ! Hey I am sorry for being late . What happened while I was in space ?

Do we decided over here among the graves if we are going to Earth with Minister Dageel or not ? That is true . All these are graves of Vegan Commanders . They battled Grendizer bravely and died with honor . This Earth we see , where we intend to migrate , is under Duke Fleed 's control . Minister Dageel Why don 't the people of Earth ask for help ? Duke Fleed has brainwashed them and they consider us invaders from space . If we kill Duke Fleed , are we then able to go to Earth ? Of course ! Then our fundamental goal will be him , isn 't that right ? Are there lots of flowers on Earth ? Yes , it is true that there are forests and lakes on Earth . We really want to go to Earth to fight ! It is an honor of Planet Vega . Do any of you want to come to Earth with me and kill Duke Fleed ? If so , then place the gravestones before tomorrow morning . There is no need to engrave your names . I am not forcing you to come . I am just put my hopes In you ! Aeinz The matter is up to you . Let 's go We shall remember very well That our main goal is to conquer Duke Fleed and to liberate the people of Earth ! People of Earth must be free and we must send him to hell ! How was the shooting star last night ? Yes , it was very big , but it was only a meteor after all . Was it a meteor ? Hey ! Do you doubt what I say ? You don 't believe me ? No , I don 't doubt what you say . The meteoroid expert , Hayashi , said so ! Hello . Good morning . Good morning . Good morning . Good morning . Daisuke , I am going to the Fuji Air Base of the National Defense Forces . Fuji Air Base ? Yes . They have asked me to check the new control tower . Maria Would you kindly take me there with Drill Spazer ? Yes . Aah ! The beautiful greenery . How lovely it is ! It is an insect What a beautiful insect ! Siko ! We don 't have time for things like this ! That is it Take a good look at it ! That is the air base 's control tower . After taking over the control tower , we will disrupt the Space Science Center 's radar with powerful electrical waves . Minister Dageel Are you sure that Duke Fleed is in the base ? We take over the tower and attack Duke Fleed with all of our strength , for the invasion of the people of Earth . When we take it over , Duke Fleed will definitely appear . Look out . We arrived , we must success . Are you alright ? Get a hold of yourself . Hurry and get an ambulance please ! There are kids ! Alright ! General Gandal General Gandal ! The kids succeeded in entering the base . Alright , we can send the Vegan beast at any time now . I will hide in the forest until everything ends . After disrupting the radar , I will quickly send the Saucer Beast Daki Daki . Roger that . Let 's go ! Let 's move ! What is this ? What is the matter ? What is this ? Let 's go now . Come on . Oh ! The radar ! What happened ? Electrical waves jammed the radar . Jammed the radar ? We are not your enemies . We are fighters from Vega ; we came to free you . What ? From Vega ? Slow down We are your friends . We came to free you from Duke Fleed ! What you are saying ? I don 't understand what you are saying , you fighters . Maria ! The emergency alarm ! There is no use ! Hello . How I can help you ? Eh ? ! The control tower of the air base is under attack by Vegan fighters ? Eh ? What ? The control tower ? What is the matter ? Daisuke , the Doctor and Maria went to the tower ! Strange The people of Earth normally lose consciousness with this Vegan magnetic medal . That is right . She wasn 't affected . We didn 't lose consciousness because we were trained to do so . But even the people of Vega lose consciousness for thirty minutes ! Who are you ? Don 't shoot ! But she pushed the alarm button . Why did you push the alarm button ? We came to save you . Don 't be afraid . Then , why did you kill so many people ? That is not true We made them lose consciousness for a while . You mean ? Oh ! Aeinz , come here . What is it ? We are surrounded by military vehicles ! Damn ! More war vehicles here ? There a large number of people who were brainwashed by Duke Fleed . Oh ! Grendizer is coming ! Heh ? Grendizer ? ! Damn ! We were idiots to think we can jam the radar , but we failed . What we should do now ? How is the situation inside ? Yes . The Chief , the Doctor and a girl are detained . We have to do something for them , as the situation is very dangerous . Maria is also detained ? I heard that they were five boys from Planet Vega . What ? Five boys ? They are using innocent boys ? I am Duke Fleed Do you hear me , Vegan youth ? It is Duke Fleed just as I expected . There is no doubt that it is him . Duke Fleed ! We won 't kill the people of Earth like you did ! WE WON 'T ALLOW YOU ! What ? What do you mean by that ? You know very well that you brainwashed and enslaved the people of Earth ! Duke Fleed , as spacemen , we came to save them from you ! Isn 't what we said about you is the truth ? We will save them from you ! There is no doubt that the men of Vega brainwashed the innocent children . What is wrong ? You will face some difficulties if you attack us . We will blow up this control tower and the hostages as well ! Huh ? ! What ? Duke Fleed , we will remain in our location here until we attack you . Damn ! The hostages must be saved no matter what . But how we should do that ? Who is your leader ? I want to talk to him ! There is no need for talk with you ! If you wanted to kill me specifically , then there is no need to kill other than me ! What are we going to do ? Don 't trust Duke Fleed . For sure he is tricking us ! Duke Fleed never tricks anyone ! Shut up ! Beca , are you able to connect with Minister Dageel ? Minister Dageel Minister Dageel ! This is the young fighter addressing you . Minister Dageel ! There is no use I can 't establish any connection because the control tower blocks it ! Damn ! We can 't communicate with him . Aeinz , we will follow your orders from now on . Huh ? ! Their military vehicles withdrew ! Duke Fleed is alone now . Monitor him and his surroundings closely . There is nothing here ! And this side as well is clear . Listen to me ! Our forces withdrew ! Return to Vega now . Re Return to Vega ? I don 't believe him . He is fooling us ! No . Duke Fleed never lies . Shut up ! Shut up or else I will have to ... Trou , stop it immediately ! We have to advise a plan first to success . Aeinz , we are five , so we can win . Yes , we came to Earth to kill Duke Fleed ! We have to remain here until it 's possible to connect with Minister Dageel . Did I do something wrong ? That is not true . The magnetic medal in fighting Duke Fleed is not sufficient . But ... We also have the laser guns . Our chances are 50150 for success . It might just be a gun , but it is also a chance . Alright , come on , proceed ! Aeinz , come on . Let 's fight Duke Fleed with dignity . Alright , I understood . But before doing that , we have to try to connect with Minister Dageel for the last time . Aeinz Aeinz ! Do you read me ? The Vegan beast has arrived . Aeinz Answer now ! Minister Dageel , were you able to connect with the children ? No , I wasn 't able to . Duke Fleed , get out your gun ! Hurry and pull it . I won 't fight you ! I only want to speak with you ! Be tranquil , if you don 't have a weapon , then I won 't kill you . I have no weapon . What ? I don 't want to fight you ! What is wrong ? Aeinz , there is no doubt he has a gun . KILL HIM ! Don 't make a move or I will kill him ! He had a gun just as I expected ! Duke Fleed , I will never believe you after this ! No problem . Kill him ! Trou , wait ! Wait , Trou . Don 't worry about me ! Hurry and shoot the traitor ! Come on do as I said ! I am sorry . I won 't shoot this boy . But I can 't find another way to reason with you . Everyone listen to me . They have given you false information . The one who wants to conquer Earth are the inhabitants of Vega , not me ! Don 't listen to him ! He is tricking us ! Hurry and kill him . HURRY ! Don 't forget you , youngsters ! A demon who controls Earth is Duke Fleed . Kill him ! One moment please Look around you at theses flowers and forest . And look at those mountains . Is this the Earth that I conquered ? I want the Earth without wars . Did you understand me ? I want the real peace . I have no other ambition , believe me ! In any case , it is better that you return to Vega , and tell the inhabitants of the planet that there are many ways that they can live with the people of Earth . Damn ! The Vegan beast is coming ! Please inform him of what I told you . I will return this gun to you . I don 't want this youth to have a weapon like that . Beca ! Get a hold of yourself ! Beca be brave . BECA ! Minister Dageel , why did you kill our friend Beca ? Aeinz , let 's escape . It is dangerous to stay here . But ... We must do that , let 's go ! Aeinz I am sorry about Beca , but shall we go now ? Dageel , what are you doing ? Let the children go ! General Gandal , you will soon know my intention . Aeinz , what are you thinking about ? Why didn 't Duke Fleed kill me over there ? He couldn 't do that . That is right , but ... When Beca was accidentally shot Duke Fleed picked him up without thinking of himself ... He hold Beca in his hands . Aeinz , surely you didn 't believe what Duke Fleed said ? ! Those who want to conquer Earth are the inhabitants of Vega . Duke Fleed never lies . Never ! His eyes are not ones of a man who was brainwashed . Don 't you agree with me , Tsubi ? But ... Don 't become troubled , Aeinz . We must only believe Minister Dageel . That is right , we are chosen from Vega young fighters and we must follow orders ! Yes , we have to ! Now ! Damn ! Let 's go now ! Wait , Kouji ! The children are inside the beast . But if we don 't fire at him we will ... Duke Fleed , watch out ! Danger ! He won 't come this way ! Aeinz ! Don 't you want to come back safe ? Excellent , fight like this ! They are targeting me only , but they have no weapons ! A suicidal attack . Correct . The children will attack this way and this is dangerous for them . Danger ! Cyclone Beam ! Kouji You take care of the beast . I will try to bring the children down to the ground . Okay ! Shoot In ! Dizer Go Kouji Don 't fire at the beast because of the children . Understood . Oh ! Duke Fleed , behind you ! Alright . NOW ! Damn ! The children ! I will never forgive them They gave orders to innocent unarmed kids to attack ! You are lower than insects ! You ! Inside the monster ! Double Harken ! Double Cutter ! Space Thunder ! You idiot ! You tricked the children with your dirty ways and this is your punishment for your crime . I am sorry . Because I loaded the gun with ammunition . Thus , I was the cause of your death . Please , forgive me . Yes ... We were happy for our arrival on Earth . The flowers , the insects and the beautiful nature were real things . We know that Duke Fleed is not a liar and that he is a brave young man who loves peace . Yes that is true . Now you won 't fight again You can now reset in peace with your friends . UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Sixty . Tokyo Tower Will Be Destroyed at 7 P.M. What ? The Midifo squadron suddenly disappeared from the airspace of the Tokyo Gulf ? The Vegan station must be close to the sea surrounding Japan . I wonder if they want to attack Japan first ? Alright . Therefore , protecting Japan from attack means protecting the entire Earth . The enthusiasm has begun to overwhelm me ! Aren 't you like me , Maria ? That is right . Father . It is strange for the Midifo squadron to appear and not Vegan beasts are you with me in this I think they are preparing for their attack this way . Alright , I understand . I will explore the matter . Yes ! Hold on , I will accompany you ! Double Spazer Go ! Marine Spazer Go ! So Kouji , I will look under the sea . Alright I will explore the island from the air . Good luck ! Good luck to you too dude . Listen to me , Kouji . What is the matter ? Kouji , you treat me like a child , Why ? ! I don 't think that I treat you like a child . You are Maria , and you are Daisuke 's sister , so we have to worry and take care of you . Kouji ! I am not asking you about my brother , I am asking about myself . Kouji , rather I say that it is you who is treating me like a child . Do you understand me ? You have become mature , Maria . Don 't forget that you have become a member of our team . Thank you , Kouji . Tell me Maria can 't you quit calling me just , Kouji , Kouji ? Why ? Call me Mr. Kouji for example . Kouji is Kouji ! It is humorous for me to call you Mr. Kouji . How beautiful your words are . Alright , I will call you Mr. Kouji as long as you just call me Maria . And now , go on ; call me Maria now , what 's my name ? Eh ! Enough now . To the marines of Zuril 's submarine . We have to be on standby to being the battle and success . To the Rats Operation . Captain of Zuril 's ship , go ! Yes , sir ! Operation starts ! We will arrive at the sea of Tokyo right away . Alright . Don 't stray from your course . Minister Zuril Will we succeed in escaping the radar ? Don 't worry . The waves are too weak to be detected by the radar , be sure of that . We tested the matter well . Yes . Prepare to release Beam A ! Launching is on standby ! Launch ! Kouji . There is no danger on the island nor the sea near Tokyo . I will explore some more now . I can 't find anything suspicious till this moment . I will continue my exploration . If you find anything , tell me immediately . Understood ? Roger that dude . Minister Zuril , it looks like they have begun to assemble . Supplying Submarine , ascend to the surface right away and release Beam B to lead Beam A. Minister Zuril , we are approaching our target . Alright , approach slowly . Yes , Sir ! It is almost the break of dawn . This is Kouji speaking . I found nothing suspicious in my reconnaissance . And what about you , Maria ? This is Maria speaking Until now , I have found nothing abnormal . That is my report . Roger that . Alright , ascend to the surface . Understood , Kouji . Even those evil ones couldn 't do anything when we monitored them . But Kouji , even if nothing happened this night , we should still intensify the observation . Absolutely . You are very energetic , Maria . Kouji Of course ! Because I am sincere member of the Space Science Center . Ops If I talk to her a little , her eloquence increases . I can 't keep up with her . Eh ? ! Did you say something , Kouji ? No ! I say that we should continue the observation ! First we should hurry and rest a little . I am with you in that . How are the preparations proceeding ? Yes We injected all the rats with Vegatron bomb fluid . We would like you to take a look at these experiments . Alright . Let me see the results . Yes , Sir ! I believe that the power of this one is double the power of the previous one . I will switch on the cylinder that launches waves which are faster than sound . The rat runs towards the cylinder that launches the ultrasonic vibrations . What do you think ? A single rat has all this power ? If 10,000 or 100,000 of it gathered , then we won 't have to use a Vegan beast for a surprise assault on Tokyo and destroying it . Tokyo will fall with this Rat Operation . I will conquer Japan 's capital , Tokyo ! I will success . Kouji ! Kouji , come on , wake up ! Shut up and leave me alone I want to sleep ... Wake up , come on ! It is a dangerous matter ! Come on ! The matter is definitely not dangerous ! Let me to sleep a little more please . You 've forced me to do that ! I am sorry ... No no no it is my fault ! Tell me ! What is the matter ? I repeat This evening at 7 P.M. we the army of Vega , will destroy the Tokyo Tower . Also we will destroy Tokyo Station . And after half and hour later We will destroy the Tokyo Station . Our request is one , and it is handing over your weapons and surrendering , or else , we will occupy Tokyo with our armies of Vega ! What ? This station was interrupted by an unknown signal ! But We will continue the news again . Immediately after the interruption , the Tokyo Tower was searched and nothing suspicious was found . Their danger is not over yet . If no explosives were found , then this might be a part of their plot . Father ! We will engage in an immediate counter attack . I see . I request that from you . Maria , let 's go now ! Yes . Grendizer Go ! Marine Spazer Go ! Drill Spazer Go ! Double Spazer Go ! Make Tokyo Tower the center and monitor Tokyo from three sides . I will go and monitor the sea . Roger that . There is no need for precise monitoring . Our explosion plan is being executed by 1,000 to 10,000 rats . Even if some of them are killed , the rest will reach the target and blow it up for sure . Even with Grendizer 's help , they cannot repel this attack . Our battle starts at 6 o 'clock with transporting the army of rats that is subject to ultrasonic waves , to the areas of their launch in the Tokyo Tower ! No mistakes are acceptable ! We must success no matter what . Strange , what they planned to do ? I wonder how they can blow up Tokyo Tower ? After fifteen minutes it will be 7 o 'clock . All the people ran away from around Tokyo Tower for salvation . Everyone , let 's gather here ! Keep an opened eye on every move happens ! Roger that ! There are only eight minutes left . Duke Fleed . ! Kouji , there are only three minutes left . Damn ! Where will their attack come from ? Nothing can be seen ! Duke , what shall we do ? If an explosion takes place , then we must know its cause . They have threatened to cause another explosion We must stop it before it happens . Only one minute left ! Everyone ! Search the tower again . Be careful and avoid the explosion . Roger that . Maria , don 't get close , it is dangerous ! Don 't worry . Have trust in my piloting skills . Pr Professor ! I can 't say it is a timed bomb , impossible ! But Professor , the explosion was powerful ! This is a Vegatron wave . They must have destroyed the tower With Vegatron explosives from an unknown place ! Duke , what is the matter ? Nothing , I am alright . Did you notice anything strange during the explosion ? No , nothing at all . Neither did I. I saw rats on the tower ! Rats ? Yes I saw rats climbing the tower . Is that what made you scream ? Because I hate rats so much ! That is right ! The rats did it ! Eh ? ! What are you saying ? The rats did it ? When the Vegans attacked the squad , they injected the animals with Vegatron fluid , like what happened in Planet Fleed . And they blew them up after they directed them with ultrasonic waves . The rats are the ones that destroyed Tokyo Tower ! We must hurry and stop the rats before they reach Tokyo Station ! Let 's hurry now before they do another explosion . Duke , there is no use ! The rats are very small and hard to see ! But There is no better way to find them . What was that explosion ? OH ? ! Rats ! I found the rats ! Oh ! Over there ! Duke , we must stop them ! There is no use of doing that . Attacking them one by one will take a long time . And there is a big danger in attacking them as well ! Does that mean we are not able to resist ? No we can . We can stop this crawling . By one way . It is the ultrasonic wave that moves them to the target . We can jam this wave . But if we did , then these explosive rats will spread all over Tokyo . Duke ! Duke Fleed ! Oh , Father ? There is one way , but it is dangerous . What is it ? That we jam the ultrasonic wave , and we weaken the vision of these rats with a strong beam when they get to their target . Then they will move towards the light . That way we lead them to one place to eliminate them all together . I understood . I will try ! If your timing is off , then the explosions will spread all over Tokyo ! Tokyo will be over ! Go now with God help . Yes . Hikaru ! When I give you the signal , send the jamming radio frequency . Roger that ! Kouji and Maria . Send the beam to weaken the rats ' vision after that immediately ! Roger that ! After that , I will take care of their matter . Kouji ... What is it ? You seem sad ? I just can 't ... it doesn 't matter if I am called a kid. lf I see a lot of rats , I will lose consciousness ! Don 't worry , leave it to me . Maria , I can do your work as well . Kouji , let 's go now ! Alright ! I will attack them all ! Ready Okay ! Ready Okay ! Jamming the radio , launch ! Launch ! Light Bomb launch ! Alright ! Everything is running well . What do you think , Maria ? Don 't ask me ! I am shivering ! Well done , Duke Fleed ! But watch out until the last moment . Yes . You three , get ready . I am coming now . Let 's go now ! I will erase these rats with Missile ! Kouji let me take care of it ! Drill Missile ! What a failure you caused to me , Grendizer ! So , Kouji , what do you say about my skills ? Ops Is that fair ? Your skill is in the last hit ? ! Kouji If you are angry , then you are still a kid , right ? Eh ? ! Say whatever you like ! Ah . Kouji ! Wait me ! Please , Kouji ! UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Sixty One . The Vegastos Plan With The Spies . Help my Father ! Hurry ! What is the matter with Father ? He is not eating his food ! Does he have a stomach ache ? Aow , Aow Hold it . Are you in pain ? I am so sorry . Aow , are you in pain ? Forgive me please . Father ! What happened to Aow ? I was so stupid . I should 've turned back But I took a downward sloping route ... I wanted to act like the western cowboy stars in the movies ; I want to be like Billy Cooper ! Where the stars rides down the slope to catch the criminals . I didn 't care about the horse at all . I was in a hurry to catch the criminal like Billy . But that was going to make me go to the other world . What an idiot I am ! Oh my GOD ! I don 't know how to apologize to you , Aow . That is all what happened . But why are you refraining from food , Father ? IDIOT My hunger cannot be compared to the suffering of Aow , the horse ! Did you understand , all of you ? I will take care of it . Go and get some rest . Don 't stick your nose in this matter . I have to take full responsibility ! You two ! Yes , Sir ! As you two know , all of our raids against the Space Science Center have failed . And I must admit that the Space Science Center is an invincible castle on Earth . And the victory of our Vegan Forces solely deepens on destroying it ! Don 't you two have any other plans to overcome the Space Science Center ? What about you , General Gandal ? Yes , Sir ! Minister Zuril ! I do have one ! What ? Is that true ? Yes ! A Vegastos plan ! Vegastos ? ! That is right . What I should do with them ? They are , Toke 1,2,3 and A , Sh ' . ! And that short one ? He is Toke A. He will assume the role of Makiba Danbi . Hmm , looks like an interesting plan , I hope for your success . Yes . Thank you my Great King . Daddy ! - The horse , Aow , can walk freely now . - Congratulations for that Daddy ! Your care all night proved fruitful . You 've done really good , Uncle . Mm I will never repeat that mistake again Aow . It seems like it knows what you are saying , Uncle Danbi . It can 't speak . But it understands everything you say , if you treat it as a friend and with love . You 're right , Uncle Danbi . We have to treat all animals with love . That 's right . And if you don 't behave like that , then you won 't become a real cowboy . Dawn is when people are very lax . Don 't let that chance bypass you . Proceed with Vegastos Plan Part One . Go to there ! Move ! It looks like today will be cold , Mr. Hayashi . There is nothing unusual until now . Okay . Is everything alright ? Yes , until now everything alright . Alright . Finally ! Father ! The bomb detector was effective . The explosion left little damages . Who plotted this ? The Vegan forces executed a new plan for sure . They must have realized , after this attempt , the difficulty of blowing up the place . A very hard thing to do . I didn 't know that there was a bomb detector and that the shutter closes automatically . There are also surveillance cameras all over the place as well . Alright . Now to Vegastos Part Two . Everybody went out , including my daughter Hikaru , to find out about the matter in the Space Science Center . What do you think it is , Aow ? Huh ? ! What is the matter ? Calm down . My God ! What a beautiful white horse ! Aow , can you pursue it ? Are you sure then ? Don 't worry . We have to catch that horse , Aow . But let me know if you are not able to run anymore . Let 's go Let 's go ! My God , I 've never seen a horse like this one in my entire life . Aow , let 's go ! Hurry ! Hey , hey ! Where are you going ? Wait Wait Wait ! Aow Purser it ! Come on ! Hurry ! Let 's go ! Come on it is the Vegastos ! I must catch it even if it takes my entire life ! Eh ? ! Where did it go ? Toko 4 , it is your turn now . Alright , you look just like Danbi Nobody will notice that . Let 's go now . Toko 4 Remain here and monitor . Yes , Sir ! Take a look . We are only 100 meters away from the defense wall of the Space Science Center . We will get close at a distance of 10 meters away and then infiltrate the center with the torpedoes . Drill the hole with the silent laser guns so that we are not discovered . Then , destroy the Space Science Center room . Then , destroy the Center 's power generator room . Oh , Daddy ! Eh What are you doing , Daddy ? Stop it Stop it please ! I am still strong as always , isn 't that so ? Why did you kill it , Daddy ? You always say that we shouldn 't kill anything , isn 't that so ? It is fun even for once . Goro , I must capture the Vegastos horse ! Follow me . Hey ! Wait a moment ! How tasty this thing is ! Something strange . What is the strange ? You usually bring your mouth close to the glass . You say that the juice tastes better when the mouth welcomes the glass . Ah The just tastes better today , so I forgot ! Here look at me ... Yes , that way and it is as if you 're ... It is getting late . It is better that you hurry and go to bed . Alright , good night . I will drink the rest ! There are strange things . He doesn 't seem like my Daddy . Alright . Don 't say that he is not your father because of the way he drank the juice . Let 's keep in mind what Goro said . Go and verify it that yourself . I will go as well . You are welcome all of you . What is that ? Dan ! - That 's the snoring of my Father . - That 's Uncle Danbi . Let 's go back ! You know that we have a lot of work to do in the Space Science Center tonight . I am sorry . Goro , it is time ! Yes . Kouji , look there ! Uncle Danbi ! Uncle Danbi What is it ? Maria ! Let 's take him to the doctor right away ! What happened to you , Father ? Somebody shot me and startled Aow , and so I fell in the valley . When did that happen ? Yesterday afternoon . Yesterday afternoon ? But you were there yesterday afternoon , Uncle Danbi ! Eh ! ? Nonsense ! Not true ! Where was I ? You know that my father was in the valley ... There is some sort of mistake ! Alright ! Goro , where is Father ? He went out early this morning in pursuit of the Vegastos horse . What is he planning I wonder ? So no one from the Space Science Center has noticed anything yet ? Yes . Alright , we have the chance . Listen to me . This defense wall is reinforced with two layers . Toko 1 and 2 will destroy the wall and Toko 3 will attack the power generator room . All of you , understood ? Yes , Sir ! Leave now . Start ! Professor , strange objects are approaching the Space Science Center from underground . What ? Trigger the defense systems . I am afraid it is too late now The Research Center Emergency System Number 1 ! Too late ! The last emergency system ! Too late ! The power room has been destroyed ! Start the second power generator right away ! Father ! The main power generator room has been destroyed ! Leave it to us . Let 's go ! Double Spazer ! Marine Spazer ! Drill Spazer ! GO ! Eh ? ! Another battle will take place with those damned ones ! What the hell ... I have to hurry ! Hurry ! Hurry and close the shutter immediately ! The shutter is damaged . What ? Look ! The shutter is not working . Midifo are on the way ! Sauce Beast Goua Goua attack immediately ! Destroy the Space Science Center ! Hurry ! The shock system ! Damn ! It is not working ! Use the second shock system immediately ! Oh ! Midifo came ! It is approaching the base ! Danger ! What do you think of that ? Hurry ! Hurry ! Hurry and escape ! Everyone , hurry and escape ! GORO ! Are you alright ? Goro ! Escape ! Escape hurry ! Eh ! Aow , escape quickly ! Come on ! Move now ! Come on , escape ! Escape ! Ah come on Aow . Take it easy . Come on escape now , hurry !

Are you alright , Maria ? I am alright . Duke , the enemy is very alert ! I know that . I have to wait until the right moment to surprise it . Shoulder Boomerang ! Alright ! Dizer Jump ! Spazer Cross ! Damn ! Alright ! Space Thunder ! Even Grendizer is not able to reach the ability of our saucer beast Goua Goua . Our victory is near . Let it show off its vigilance . But it will surely have a heedless moment . Shoulder Boomerang ! You ought not to be arrogant . Hand Beam ! Double Harken ! That is not enough yet ! Hmm Vegastos Part Three . Yes . The final phase of the plan . Failure is unacceptable . Yes , understood . It was a fierce dangerous fight . Oh , Mr. Danbi ? Hello , everyone . Hello , everyone . Mr. Danbi , is everything alright with you ? Yes nothing DIE ! Professor , are you okay ? WAIT ! Strange Where did he go ? Come on , I am glad that everything is over now . Daddy , would you bring a bucket of water please ? Okay . Okay . Who are you ? Who the hell are you ? Oh ! There is two of my Daddy ! Who are you ? Who are you ? Take that ! Take this punch !

So one of them is real and the other is fake . You monster ! Which one of them is my real father ? Aren 't you able to tell , Hikaru ? Hey , this is my friend , Aow . Aow , tell us who is the real one You are able to know him , isn 't that so ? Yes . Sure it is me . Thank you , my dear friend , Aow ! You are the imposter ! I should escape ! Wait don 't go ! You have failed in your mission as a spy ! What the hell you 've done , idiot ! Eat some more , Aow . When you treat an animal with kindness , the it is possible to understand one another , isn 't that right , Uncle Danbi ? Hmm That 's right , isn 't that so , Aow ? Aow is a smart horse . I wasn 't able to tell who you were , Uncle Danbi . You know , to tell you the truth , I wasn 't sure if I was a real person either ! UFO . UFO Look ! Two swans ! General There are two swans ! What ? Huh ! There is a swan over there ! Fly away ! It is dangerous ! Look out ! UFO Robe Grendizer ' . Episode Sixty Two . The Day The Swans Came . Now is the migrating season . Wild geese , falcons and swans migrate to Japan from the North . These are the winter migrating birds . If you see any of these birds nearby , monitor and record your observations . Yes ! Oh ! It is a swan ! What a hard work is this ? ! - Daddy ! Daddy ! - What is the matter ? I found a wounded swan ! A swan ? Let me see . Let me look I don 't see any wound . It might be sick . Perhaps you are right We will keep it and observe it . Yes ! I will take care of it . How are you my little swan ? I brought you milk . Get a hold of yourself . Drink it . Don 't you want any ? If you don 't eat , you will die . No Please drink this . We bring you this report . Today at 1 : 15 , military jets exploded on top of Mount Shiran of an unknown reason . And at the same time , the train Hekari 105 went off the tracks because of an explosion for a reason not known yet . We will broadcast other details of these two occurrences at a later time . Explosions due to an unknown reason ? Perhaps there were due to Vegan missiles . If that was the case , then we would 've seen it on the radar and catch it . Was the radar working at that time ? Of course it was working . I investigated the matter and there was no malfunction . It wasn 't a coincidence . I fear that other occurrences will take place . Hey ! May your omen fail ! No All we can do is await more reports . Minister Zuril , tell me what happened ? Tell me how the Swan Missile Plan went . We dispatched three swans for experiments . Two were terrific But The last one went missing . Anyway the results are not bad . Begins the Swan Plan immediately . We will send the Vegan Saucer Beast via the secret route . Alright . I understood . Minister Zuril I discovered a flock of migrating birds . They are the swans no mistaken ! We can 't fire Vegatron missiles on them due to their small size . What shall we do then ? Alright . Fire the grabbing beam Yes , Sir ! General Gandal ! We captured the swans . We will prepare the missiles and dispatch them . Roger that . When you begin your plan , we will dispatch the Vegan beasts ... GANDAL . ! Yes , Sir ! How are you proceeding ? We will bring the Swan Plan to defeat Grendizer . The Swan Plan ? Yes . We will dispatch swans carrying very small missiles to the Space Science Center . This is to lure Grendizer . I see . The swans will form into missile bases . Alright . Don 't fail in defeating Grendizer this time . Yes , Sir As you wish . Put the Vegan Sauce Beast Boi Boi in my ship . Let 's begin the attack on Earth immediately ! Roger that . We will begin the work right away ! Minister Zuril ! Begin the Swan Plan immediately ! Roger that Begin the Swan Plan ! Strange ! I slept in ! Hey ! Hey ! Are you still sick ? You are very tired ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Come on ! Come on ! Move ! Hurry ! Go faster ! Daddy , hurry , hurry ! The swan is very sick and tired ! Yes , I understand you . Let 's summon Dr. Umon to treat it . He has to do something very fast ! I understood ! But he isn 't a bird doctor as you know . If he is incapable , then you must give up . Hurry ! Hurry ! Come on , move faster ! Run ! Run ! DOCTOR ! Doctor ! What is the matter , Father ? An emergency situation ! Gore 's swan ls really sick ! Swan ? What happened ? Daisuke The swan is dying ! Let the doctor examine her please . Alright . If it is wounded , then we will treat it immediately . But if it was afflicted with some disease , then nothing is at hand . Doctor ! The matter is difficult , but please ! Help it ! it is a poor thing , treat it ! Please , please , please ! Uncle ! This isn 't possible . Why ? The Doctor is a famous scholar , but he is completely helpless when the matter has to do with a sick bird . I see . Goro You must give up . Goro You must understand that advanced science something falls short . The swan will know that you tried your best . Hey Goro . Don 't cry . Let 's return home with the swan . - Yes , Daddy ... - Don 't cry my little son , don 't say anything . Father Can 't you do anything ? I wish I was able to do something ! Hey look !

The swan was turned into a cyborg . And when it was injured , it lost part of its power . That 's why the missile didn 't work , and this was fortunate for us . Then the explosions of the jets and the train were from the swan missiles . Do you agree me ? Yes . Then the swans in the dam are ready . I am afraid so . These swans are fighting missiles . They will explode once you launch with your ships . I had suspicions about the matter , what can be done ? Damn ! I won 't forgive the evil ones who infringed on the rights of the beautiful swans .

Farewell ... It can follow its friends now . UFO . UFO . UFO Robo Grendizer : Episode Sixty Three . Kirika 's Disappearance in The Ice . Commander Kirika . Is your study ready now ? Almost ready , Great Vega Daio . The snow season arrived on Earth . Therefore , you must hurry . Did you understand ? Yes my Master . I will be waiting . My brother ... If your study is completed , it won 't be necessary for us to fight the people of Earth . Then we can live with peace . Brother ... Hey , Kirika ! If I succeed in developing the freezing beam it would be possible to freeze the other burning planet in the solar system within a few moments . And we can move there right away ? That is right ... But unfortunately ... Brother , get a hold of yourself ! Kirika Please do me a favor . They say you are a genius in the matters of Planet Vega . So I request from you to take over my studies after I die . Please do that for me . Brother I promise you ... At any cost ! Kirika ... Brother ! Brother ... I will do my best ... I succeeded ! And finally I succeeded in developing the instant freezing liquid . Brother , look I succeeded . Isn 't that right ? Kirika ! Is that the instant freezing liquid ? Yes . And I will transform the liquid into a beam . And it will be possible to turn anything to ice . Is that possible ? Yes . It will be possible to turn the burning planet to a planet just like Earth . Go to the Earth right away and test that . To Earth ? Freeze Grendizer and bring him here . But Great Vega Daio ... The study that we performed is for peace not for war . Don 't argue , Kirika . Unless we kill Grendizer , we won 't live in peace . If you don 't obey me , then I will ask someone else to do it . But I promised my brother to complete it for him myself and I will fulfill my promise to him . Then kill Duke Fleed and bring Grendizer . That 's all ! Great Vega Daio ! No argument ! Understood ... I don 't want anyone else to study it other than myself . Well done , I will connect with the Vegan Marine Base on Earth right away . Yes . Here I am , Great Vega Daio . I will send Commander Kirika to Earth with a spaceship . Back her up with radar jamming on Earth . Kirika ? Yes I will do . Huh ? ! What happened ? That 's odd . Saeki . Yes . Inform all national forces to take necessary precautions and to inform us if anything happens . Yes Understood ! I will start the freezing experiment . The Meteorology Center reported that heavy snow has fallen on the village of Tamima and that it all turned to ice instantly . There is also other information that somebody saw a UFO nearby . Now every one of you , go and investigate the situation . Roger that . Kouji and Maria ! I will take Grendizer , come with me right away . - Yes . - Alright . Remain on standby position , Hikaru . Yes . Come on , let 's go now ! Look Brother I succeeded in making the freezing beam . Kirika ! Here is Grendizer coming to investigate . Understood . Look ! The entire village is completely frozen ! Alright . I will land now . Be careful . The enemy is in the sky and if it appears , cover me ! Okay You can count on me ! What the hell happened in this town ? The village is a piece of ice ! It is impossible for a frost wave to hit only this village . What is that ? Strange A snow storm just raged suddenly I don 't see anything ! Hey Maria what a reckless girl ! I am going to look for my brother . Hey , Maria ! Damn ! Do whatever you want ! It is not my job ! Brother ! Brother ! Maria ! Here , Maria ! Brother ! Why did you come ? I just felt a bad omen . Bad omen ? It seems to me that the UFO is still hiding here . The sudden snow storm worries me . Be careful ! Huh ! Danger ! Eh What is that ? The ice wall rose ! The beam is suspicious ! Someone is shooting at us . Someone is coming close . From where ? I don 't know from where . There he is ... I got it now The beam is what turned the village into ice . Danger ! It is a girl ! Don 't worry She is alright . It seems like she got an electric shock from the laser beam . Thanks God she is alright . But how did she know we were hiding behind the ice ? When you jumped from behind the ice the same thing happened . I see . What we will do with her ? Let 's take her with us and return . Yes . They detained Kirika ! What are we going to do , Minister Zuril ? Don 't worry and wait . Duke Fleed will fall in the trap . Brother Brother ... Brother I succeeded ... Brother Kirika Kirika Brother it is me Kirika Don 't leave me ... My brother ... And finally you regained your conscience ! You are the inhabitants of Earth ? That is right . You lost your consciousness because of the laser beam . Don 't worry now , you will heal right away . Here , this is your gun . I don 't want to say anything . Hey ! He saved your life so don 't talk like that ! Isn 't the UFO still hiding in the village ? Answer , eh ? ! Come on , what is wrong ? Speak ! Take it easy , Kouji . Leave her to me . We can 't force information out of her . Father . Let her rest by herself for a bit . I think it is a good idea , but what about you ? Alright , take this please , it is a relaxant . No Kill me . I am not afraid . I told you to take it ! I am treating you with utmost kindness ! Do you hear ? Good , you will heal soon . And now rest for a bit . Call us if you need anything . My sister will look after you . Your sister ? You are Kirika , right ? How did you know that ? You were talking in your sleep . And now let 's go , Maria . They are kind , even though they are from the inhabitants of Earth . They 've protected me sincerely But I will fulfill my duty . It seems as if they didn 't notice that the freezing gun is in this ring . I will turn Duke Fleed into a piece of ice when I discover him . Duke Let 's go back to the village . Alright ! Duke ! There are Vegatron frequencies around that hill , let 's go . Alright , let 's go . Dizer Go ! Hand Beam ! There it is ! Alright , let 's check it from the inside . Let 's send it to the base . It might self-destruct . I will go check it . Duke Fleed is getting close . You will pay the price . Duke , are you alright ? Oh ! Duke ! The door is automatically closing ! It is a trap ! Damn ! I fall in their trap ! Alright . The Saucer Beast Zumi Zumi get ready to attack him and launch immediately ! Alright , out of the way quickly ! Duke ! Duke Answer me ! There is no use . It is been converted to remote control from the outside ! I will freeze if I remain like this ! That is right ! I will ask Kirika to open it ! Hurry up , Zumi Zumi ! Duke Duke is locked inside your spaceship ! Did you plot that from the beginning ? Me ? Impossible ... Come with me then . We want you to open the door . Damn there is no use ! I can destroy it with the Cyclone Beam , but Duke is inside ! What I should do ? Kirika ! Open the door immediately so that we let you go ! That is the deal I will give to you ! Alright . But I would find it strange if Duke will be saved . What ? Get away . Kirika ! Kirika ! Wait ! Kirika ! Duke Fleed , this is your last day . This ring contains the freezing gun . Get ready to die . Wait ! Kill me instead of my brother ! Your brother ? Yes , he is my brother ! Is he the one who saved me ? Duke Fleed ... Commander Kirika , What are you waiting for ? Hurry and don 't worry . Zumi Zumi is coming to help you ! It is about time that it arrives . Damn ! Oh ! Brother ! Duke ! Stay away ! Don 't move , you two . Get away ! Get away , Maria . I won 't do that ! You will die with him . Maria ! Maria , get away now ! Why did you shoot at us ? Why you are doing this to us ? What ? And why did you ruin the relationship between you and my brother ? Why do you want to kill him ? And here we met , even though we were separated due to the attack of the United Vegan Forces . But You are going to kill my brother . I won 't allow you to do that !

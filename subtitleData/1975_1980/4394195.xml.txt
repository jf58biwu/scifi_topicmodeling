 Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . All right ? Rothwyn . It 's all right , I 'm awake . Rothwyn . I 'll deal with Benny . Day 27 . Experimental project ... ES stroke five stroke treble seven , urban examination and observation . Time of day : 8 : 12am ... old time . Month : January ... old calendar . Year : 1980 AD . All right , all right . Here I am . Hello . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' Oh , little one ! I 'll put you back , put you back . Shh , shh , shh , shh . It 's still winter . Well , it would be , wouldn 't it ? Eldred and I seem to be adjusting quite well to the cold weather . So does the baby . Our temperatures are normal . That 's living inside , of course ... with a comparatively civilised system of heating . Outside ... I 'd hate to imagine how we 'd survive outside . I only need to look out to feel threatened by it . - This is the top floor . - Then they must be here . Oh , and I wanted to report a transference failure . Eldred said it was not important at this stage ... but it is to me . After all , I am responsible for the domestic side of this experiment , am I not ? You see , we stopped receiving supplies of nutrition . Two days ago . It 's probably some simple breakdown that you 've already noticed so I suppose there 's nothing to worry about . We still have some supplies left , I 'll try to make them last . We don 't mind making a study of 20th century food but we shouldn 't like to have to eat the stuff . Living room . This place hasn 't been lived in for months . We 're too late . 86 days . It 's been empty for 86 days . - It happened 86 days ago ? - No , we would have been told . People from another time , people who shouldn 't be here . What would 86 terrestrial days mean to them either way ? If something had happened to them , we would have known . This whole planet would have known by now . We 've searched this whole building , every floor , every room . - I know but they 're here ! - What are these people , invisible ? - Microscopic ? - I don 't know . But whoever they are , I know they 're somewhere here . And whatever wants to attack them ? I don 't think it 's even started . Not properly . The kitchen . 8 : 28am , day 27 . 'Steel ? They are here . ' Breakfast . 20th century style . 'Steel ? ' There would have been actual items of food . There would have been eggs - real eggs , natural bread ... natural butter ... and probably some kind of preserve . 'A girl . No , not quite a girl . 'A woman ! Yes , a woman . ' 'You mean you can hear her ? ' 'No , I just know she 's here somewhere . 'And a man , there 's also a man . ' 'Where ... ' 'Wait ! 'There 's a third one . 'A child ... 'No ... a baby . ' Yes , it 's a small baby . - A baby ? Here ? - Yes . - Well , can you hear it ? - No . - Can they hear us ? - I don 't think so . But whoever they are , the atmosphere is normal , it feels normal . Yes , well , it 's far from normal . I 'm gonna check the building again . No , Steel . I said they 're here . Here , in this room ? No . In another time ? Where ? Above us . They 're somewhere above us . And as well as having to prepare ... and cook this food for the morning meal , our dear housewife and mother of the late 20th century ... would have been organising her evening meal at about the same time . On the roof . They 're hiding on the roof ! No , they 're not hiding . In , say , nine out of ten homes , the main task in the preparing of that evening meal ... would have been restoring to its proper temperature the principal element of that meal . And that principal element would almost always have been ... a piece of dead animal . What happened ? The attack has started . There may be another level , a rooftop apartment . Hello . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Lean forward . Is this the last of the consignment ? Not quite . Whatever it is , will you tell me , please ? I mean , it 's not as if they 're likely to leave us stranded here in time . I hope not . 'Did you hear that ? ' 'Hear what ? ' 'It 's stopped now . It was about ... about there , just over there . ' 'What was it ? ' 'People talking - two . ' 9 : 34am , day 27 . 'There . It 's there now . ' - ' Voices ? ' - ' Only one voice this time . ' I 'd like a signal back , please . I 'd like to be sure that you can still hear me . Would you please signal back ? 'Can you hear what it 's saying ? ' 'No . 'Careful ! I don 't trust this . ' 'Neither do I. - ' What about the voice ? ' - ' Gone . 'What is it ? ' 'Here . ' It 's a wall ! 'The wall ends here . 'It 's a corner . 'There 's more along there , what about your side ? ' 'The same . ' 'Can you feel any windows or doors ? ' 'No , just a wall . Well , a wall texture . ' It won 't signal back ? No . 'Well , what is the texture , brick ? Stone ? What ? ' 'It feels like brick and yet ... 'and yet it has a composite strength , a strength like metal . 'It 's homogenous . ' 'Oh , yes ? ' 'All of one texture . 'Whatever this is made of , it 's synthetic . ' 'Can you identify the substances ? ' 'No . ' So which one did you try ? The master pad . Well , we usually get an instant signal back from that , don 't we ? Yes . Experimental project ES stroke five stroke treble seven . We have been told that certain people are experimenting with time . People from the not-too-distant past or the not-too-distant future . - Am I right ? - That 's right , yes . And as nobody should mess around with time ... - Except us . - Except us that these people are in danger . And not only them , time itself is in danger . 'I think that it 's a capsule 'and that its crew is a family , a small family of three . ' 'And tell me something else . 'From what date , what time is that thing ? 'I mean , give me an estimate . ' 'It 's from the future ... 'about ... 1500 years . ' Could we please have a signal back ? Only we seem to have lost all means of communication with you . Also the transference system seems to have broken down . We 're getting no supplies and we 've our child here with us , remember . - If you could try to signal back ... - I 'm frightened . - Frightened ? - Yes . Because there 's something else . Something else is happening . 'Careful ! ' 'It 's all right . It 's quite safe . ' And you say they 're hallucinations ? - Yes . - Well , I shouldn 't worry . - No ? - No . You were trained to sense things . It was part of your studies , wasn 't it ? So that 's bound to make you more receptive than the rest of us . Remember when you used to put your hands to the sides of your head and think hard ... - Eldred . Eldred ! ... so you could communicate ? - Yes ? - I really am frightened , frightened for all of us . All right , we 'll talk to the others this evening . - Yes . - See what they think . This is a terrible part of time in which to be trapped . - But we 're not trapped . - It 's brutal , it 's cruel . - People like us , we 'd never survive . - But we 're safe in here . We 're protected . Nothing can possibly get in , not in here . - But the things I felt and saw ! - A pillow ? How can we possibly be harmed or feel threatened by a pillow ? Steel ? Steel , there 's something in there with them ! Steel ? Steel , can you hear me ? Steel , come back ! 'Steel ! ' Steel , whatever it is , it 's seen you . Steel ? It 's coming for you ! Steel !

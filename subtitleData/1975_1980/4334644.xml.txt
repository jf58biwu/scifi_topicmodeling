 We have two meadow people and three of ours . Just so they 're young and healthy . They are . - They will serve you well in the mines . - Bring them forward . Lorko . - Good . - Arma . - Fine . - Clim . - I 'm sorry . - My men will hunt him down . It will be good sport . Don 't bother to bring him back . - Where is his replacement ? - We will draw lots at once ... to find one of our people to take Clim 's place . I think I can hear the sound of running water . Mm . There used to be this , uh , running brook . It was right behind the house I lived in in Central City . Hah . You better can it , little chimp . You 're gonna be crying in a minute . Hah . I know . But I can 't help it sometimes . I 'm with you , Galen . Pete , if you 've developed a vaccine against memories , give me a shot of it . Well , of course . I 've got a patented cure . If you lose one home , you try to find another one , preferably among friendly natives who are about , oh , so tall ... - and round in the right places . - Round natives ? Oh , Galen , you 're such a square . - Wait . - [ Hoofbeats Approaching ] - Think they 're looking for us ? - No . If they were , they 'd be looking around more . What do you say we get out of here before they do start looking around more ? Huh . You know , if I didn 't know you better , I 'd think you were afraid . I am . That 's what keeps me alive . - Really ? - Oh , yeah . Stick with me . You got a lot to learn about the value of creative cowardice . - [ Galen ] Creative cowardice , huh ? - [ Hoofbeats ] Quiet ! - These are my friends . - [ Panting ] Well , whoever you are , I thank you . I was sure I 'd be caught . - Why were they chasing you ? - I don 't know for sure . The patrol comes to our village , collects the grain tax and then leaves . And sometimes , they chase a human for sport . [ Panting ] We couldn 't find him . You 're slow and lazy ! I 'm sorry . - Is that the new one ? - Yes . He 's better than the one that ran . Strong . He 'll do good work . If the other was so weak , how did he get away ? Can 't you control your humans ? What kind of a leader are you ? I have provided you with five workers , twice each summer month . That fulfills my duty to you . Next time , I want all five tied , ready and waiting ! Yes , sir . Move out ! [ Sighs ] Find Clim . Yes , Father . Do you think it 's safe for you to go back now ? Oh , yes . By now , the gorillas are gone . And Borak , my village , is just over that hill . - Yeah , well , we 'll split with you at the road . - Oh , no , you must come with me . Everyone should know how you saved me . I think it 's best if we keep on moving . You will be honored guests . There 'll be a day of feasting . - I would like some fresh fruit . - Anything you want . I 'd like a broiled Maine lobster with melted butter and an ice-cold beer . I don 't know what that is , but if I can get it , it 's yours . - [ Sniffing ] - What is it , Galen ? - Hide ! - Come on ! He said hide ! - It 's all right . - Your people ? Yes . Miro , here ! It 's Clim . I brought friends with me . I could certainly go for a celebration . For all I know , this could be the Fourth ofJuly . Don 't be frightened . He can tell you . I 'm not gonna hurt you . He 's telling the truth . Just take the two humans . - What 's with you ? - You must not touch these two humans . - They are my servants and under my protection . - Take them . - You must not disobey me . - You are free to go if you wish . - They go with me . Humans obey apes . - No ! Yes , sir . Within the law . Tie Clim . Why ? I brought two humans in my place ! Isn 't the village better off ? Brun is waiting for you at the temple . I brought two humans ! That should make things all right ! - Take him away . - [ Clim ] No ! Now look , we tried to help him . We 've done nothing to hurt you . - Why are you doing this ? - It is the law . My orders are that you release these two humans immediately . My orders are from Brun , Master of Borak . - An ape ? - A human . Maybe you better talk to this , uh , Brun , Galen , sir . Where is this man you call the master of Borak ? At the temple . This way , sir . Take them to the village . [ Drumbeats , Chimes ] No ! Who is the human they call the master of Borak ? He is my father . Brun . He is my father . Brun . Tell him I want to talk to him . Until Clim has been punished , - he can speak only to the gods . - [ Clim ] Mercy ! I ask for mercy ! No ! No ! [ Drumbeats , Chimes Continue ] [ Clim ] No ! Noooooo ! Noooooo ! - [ Drumbeats , Chimes Stop ] - We come before you ... as our fathers and their fathers have done . The most sacred of our laws has been broken . Human sacrifice . One of our people , Clim , son of Porto , was chosen by lot to serve the apes . He ran from his duty . Another was taken in his place ... at a time when he need not have gone . For this , Clim is responsible . The laws of humans must be upheld . For breaking that law , Clim 's punishment is in your hands . [ Gasping ] He 's dead . Nothing- - No one touched him . The gods . Miro , where are my servants ? In the woods just outside the village . Thank you . Galen ! Did you see the head man ? No . I didn 't have a chance . - [ Virdon ] Why not ? - There was this ceremony . Uh , you know , it had to do with that man , the one who was trying to run from the gorillas . - What happened to him ? - He 's dead . He 's dead ? How ? I don 't know . Brun , the head man , took him to a shrine , prayed over him and he just died . No . Men don 't die by getting prayed over . What else did they do ? Nothing . They wheeled him in on a cart alive . He was struggling . And then Brun prayed ... and he died . I mean , I-I watched . He wasn 't even touched . - [ Sighs ] - Look , you 've got to believe me , because I saw it with my own eyes . Look , Galen , the power of suggestion can kill , but only if you believe in it . In our time , there was voodoo . Mumbo-jumbo doesn 't kill men . I can think of things that do . Gorillas , for instance . You wouldn 't talk like that if you 'd seen what I saw . Forget it . Concentrate on convincing the head man that we 're your property . And you 'd like it to leave with you undamaged and intact . Uh , it isn 't going to be easy . There 's something very special about Brun . It isn 't just that mask he wears . He 's , um , uh- - Well , look , if chimpanzees were ever afraid , and if humans were what they were afraid of , I can tell you ... that is a human to fear . We 'll , give it a try . Mm . I 'll do my best . Char , please open the cage . I think we get room service . My name is Talia . Hello , Talia . Say , we could sure use an ally . Remember what Pocahontas did forJohn Smith ? - Yeah . - Huh ? - Give it a shot . - Watch . [ Clears Throat ] Hello , Talia . I 'm Burke . Uh , Pete Burke . You know , um , where I come from , mothers used to warn their daughters about me . - But , uh , you 've really raised caution to new heights . - [ Giggles ] I could give you a demonstration right now , but I 'm a little tied up . Um- - [ Clears Throat ] You going to be the one who brings our food every day ? Yes , I am . Uh , like tonight maybe ? - Yes . - Oh . Um , you know , there 's going to be a full moon tonight . Yes , there is . Uh , what does a full moon and , um , a soft breeze ... and maybe a dozen long-stemmed red roses do for you , huh ? Talia ? Talia ? [ Giggling ] Oh ! Boy , you sure didn 't make history , John Smith . - [ Sighs ] - Talia . What 's the matter ? Talia , only one man was captured . It 's all right . There 's time . They hunted as far as the hills . It was as if the meadow people had disappeared into the earth . The next time will be better . I 'm sure . Oh , Talia , I should have gone myself . - Then there would be more than one . - [ Man ] No ! No ! Ah . No . I find it hard to believe . You , a human , telling me , an ape , that you will not accept my orders . I could have you shot . Aren 't you afraid ... - that I might have you killed ? - No . Why not ? My being afraid will not stop you from doing anything you wish , so there 's nothing to gain from fear . That is insolence ! That is total justification for me to have you shot . That is if I needed any justification . Oh . Look , I do not believe in punishing humans unnecessarily , but , obviously , we cannot condone disobedience . I will obey you in all areas where it is permitted . Oh , you will ? And who decides the areas ? I 'll tell you who does . I do . And you are going to release my servants to me immediately . - I 'm sorry , sir . - By what right do you hold them ? The apes gave us that right . Any alien human in our territory may be captured ... and delivered in place of our own people to work in the mines . - It is the law . - Well , I 've never heard of that law . [ Scoffs ] That is a ridiculous law . I don 't believe that- - I-I think you made that up . I think you are lying . A long , long time ago , the apes raided for slaves and men fought back . Many were killed on both sides . Finally , there was a meeting arranged . The apes wisely allowed us to give them five slaves ... from among any healthy humans . I refuse to recognize that law . You may seek an exception from the ape commander . None has ever been given . Would you like a guide to take you to the garrison ? Perhaps later . [ Sighs ] Look , uh , if you must give these humans to the apes , why do you waste them ? I mean , that ceremony , that- - that man you killed . I did not kill him . He was punished by the gods . I don 't think I like your gods . You have no need to . You are not a human . Fortunately . I shall remain here until I decide ... what I shall do about your insolence . I have arranged for you to have your own hut . You will be treated as an honored guest . No . No ! No ! I don 't know what 's gonna happen , but I got a feeling I 'm not gonna like it . - No . - By resisting , you only hurt yourself . Take him to the fields . - Will you go without fighting ? - Go where ? You 're to be made ready for the apes . Not me , buddy . Ain 't no way . It 'll do you no good to resist . Listen , Miro , your only hope is to fight against the gorillas , not with them . Let us out . We 'll fight alongside you . Cut us loose . And we 'll take the first crack at them . You can join in . You are not being given to the gorillas for several days . - Where are you taking us ? - To cut logs . You must be made strong . The gorillas will not accept the weak . That 's like asking a turkey to sharpen the ax before Thanksgiving . - Take them . - Hey , wait . Wait . Call ' em off . We 'll work . Thank you , Talia . Talia ! - I 'm leaving on the hunt . - So soon ? I 'll be back in a few days . I 'll come back with two , three , four , even five . [ Giggles ] Talia , I 've never failed on a hunt . I won 't fail now . - Believe me . - I believe you . I love you . I love you , Talia . Miro 's going out to hunt humans , isn 't he ? - Yes . The meadow people . - [ Burke ] Too bad they don 't have antlers . He could have one stuffed for the wall of his den . Talia , don 't you realize that makes you no better than the apes ? Both of you hunt humans and then make them into slaves . That 's not true . We don 't take slaves for ourselves . But it still slaves . Can 't you see that 's wrong ? You don 't understand . The men taken by the gorillas to run the mines don 't live longer than a few months . The women might last longer , because they just cook and serve . But they die early too . That 's why we take the meadow people so we don 't have to go . [ Sighs ] [ Leaves Rustling ] [ Virdon ] Galen . - Nicely done . - What took you so long ? Mm . Uh , thank you . [ Sniffing ] Oh , no . Tag . - You asked to see me ? - The gorillas will destroy this village ... when they find out you have imprisoned an ape . You were freeing the slaves . I 'll tell them that , and they know I don 't lie . Oh , they 'll never accept the word of a human over that of an ape . I think they will when they learn you risked your life to save two humans . No matter what I did , apes cannot be imprisoned by humans . It 's unnatural . It 's unnatural for you to be so concerned about your servants . I 'm sorry , but you 'll have to remain here under guard ... until the gorillas do come . - Good morning . - Hello , Talia . - Does your hand hurt ? - Yes . Does that surprise you a lot ? Come on , back off , Pete . It 's not her fault . [ Sighs ] Yeah , okay . Hey , Talia , you scratch everything I said , all right ? We 're still friends , aren 't we ? I mean , uh , you forgive me if we don 't shake hands ? Only one . He should have sent someone who could hunt better than me . Don 't be angry with yourself . No one is better at hunting . - [ Sighs ] - After the first night , Talia , I didn 't sleep . Every day , every night , I hunted . It must have been something I did wrong . [ Yelling ] No , please ! No ! I prayed for a good hunt . Well , you should have prayed for a son who wasn 't a failure . I know he did the best he could . [ Yelling ] Tie him off in the- - Tie him to the back of the cage ! - Miro ! - Is it bad ? It 's deep . Come to the temple . I will pray . He could die if you don 't stop that bleeding fast . Do you know how ? - We pray . - That 's not gonna save his life . - Can you help him ? - Yes . - Come , Miro . - Pray all you want . He 'll still bleed to death . Listen to them , Brun . We know men often die from bleeding . - No . - [ Talia ] Brun ? Please ? Please ? Get me a strip of cloth or leather and a stick . Do as he says and he 's got a chance . Keep on arguing and he 's a goner . Brun , please . Turn them loose . All right , bring him over here . A strip of leather . [ Grunts ] The bleeding has stopped . - I was afraid you would do this . - [ Burke ] Afraid ? We 're not expecting a round of applause , but the man is saving his life . A long time ago , men learned that a tight cord ... could stop the bleeding in an arm or a leg . Better to bleed . In a day , the arm could grow big , the fever would come . Men would die crying out in pain . That 's true . That would happen . But if you loosen the cord from time to time very carefully ... and eventually the bleeding will stop without any swelling or fever . I will pray that you are right . All right , let 's sit him down . Take it easy . It 'll be an hour or so before a clot forms . - Move your fingers . How does it feel ? - Good . - Is he all right ? - Well , he 'll be weak for a while , but he 'll be fine . Thanks to the miracle of ancient medicine . - Thanks to you . - And the gods . My father prayed . See how the gods do the next time on their own . Be careful . The gods are very powerful . They proved that by what happened to Clim . Oh , him . Mr. Grateful . Haven 't any other men tried to avoid being taken as slaves ? Yes , a few . Like Clim , they are caught and taken to the temple ... where they are punished by the gods . [ Talia ] Only the leader can walk into the temple and live . - Someday , Miro will be leader . - No , I won 't . Brun will take his son into the temple , but Miro will not be struck dead as you or I would . He will protect Miro while he teaches him the magic known only to the leader . Someone else . Not me . You see , the leader must have a wife . I won 't have one . - [ Talia ] Yes , in time . - I 'm telling you no , Talia . I 'll have no other woman but you . Not ever . When the gorillas come , they will take you two and the meadow people . That 's four . This month , I was chosen . I am the fifth . Because I failed . Feeling sorry for yourself is not going to help her very much . There 's nothing I can do . What would you do if one of the meadow people grabbed Talia and tried to run off with her ? I would stop him . I would kill him . But a human does not fight apes . Apes are not going to treat her better than they are . If you 'd stand up to them , why won 't you stand up to the apes ? - They 're wrong . They don 't understand . - You don 't understand . All right , now listen to me . Men have had to fight for what 's important to them since- - Well , for longer than you can imagine . The only way they 've been able to make a decent life for themselves ... is by burying their differences , by banding together . A human cannot fight apes ! The gods made the apes rulers of men ! - Talia , come ! - Miro . You didn 't listen to a word that I said . You are trying to put lies into my mind . You are telling me to question everything that has ever been , ; What was meant to be by gods and apes ! You can 't reach these people . They just roll over and play dead . Father . Father . Miro . What is it ? What- - What 's wrong ? How soon before the gorillas come ? Today ? - Tomorrow ? - Tomorrow . I want to go in Talia 's place . Miro ... you know the law . Village law . Made by us , not by the apes . Everyone chosen to go has a wife or a brother or a father ... who would change places if they could . I want to go for Talia . I don 't ask anyone to suffer for me . I would suffer for you . No matter what you or I feel , it cannot be . You would tear down the law . There would be no order . - You can change the law ! - What reason would I give ? Any ! None ! - In time , you will change . - I want Talia ! You teach your secret to someone else . In time , you will change . Is that a new law ? A very old one . A son will honor his father . I did honor my father . And I never stopped loving my son . Then grant my request . I cannot . - Good morning , Ort . - Good morning , Miro . You 're relieved . I will take over until Lurt comes . Yes , Miro . The gorillas come tomorrow . If I set you free ... will you take Talia with you ? Sure . Wait . And Galen . - The ape ? - Or it 's no deal . [ Burke ] Well ? All right . Say nothing to Talia . She 'll think I 'm going with you . - Why don 't you take her ? - That has nothing to do with you . - Okay . Okay . - Let 's go . Follow me . - Tag , uh , I 'd like to talk to you . - Yes , Miro . Now the gorillas are coming tomorrow , so what I want you to do is to- - Miro , I don 't think you should do this . Believe me , Talia , I know this is the right thing . - I know it is . - If you say so . As long as we 're together . Yes . You all set ? Which way ? Follow this path . Once you 're past the stream , you should be safe . - Okay , good . - You will go through the foothills . Talia will show you the trail . No , Miro . You 're coming with us . - Miro , I won 't go without you ! - If you love me , you 'll go . - [ Talia ] No ! - Shh ! - Take her ! Hurry ! - [ Muffled ] No ! - [ Man ] Miro ! Miro ! Miro , the slaves are gone . The chimpanzee too . - Well , call out the hunters . - I have . They 're waiting for you . - I will take them and block the paths . - The paths are already blocked . And we 're closing in . Don 't worry . They can 't escape . [ Miro ] Good . Follow me . You promise no noise , no trying to run ? - Can they block every way out ? - Yes . - And then they 'll find us . - Talia , now listen to me . Miro will be in bigger trouble if they find us . You must know someplace where we can hide . Our men are great hunters . They know every path and every trail . Wait a minute . Didn 't you say that nobody would ever go into the temple ? Accept for Brun , anyone would be killed by the gods . - We 'll take our chances . - Do you think we should ? Yes , Galen . Do you know how to find it ? Yes , but ... I would rather we found another place . We have no other choice . [ Galen ] Well , all right . [ Burke ] Talia , I know you 're afraid of the temple , but trust me , nothing will happen to you , I promise . I will go into the temple with you . - Good girl . - I want to die . [ Sighs ] Beautiful . Talia ! Come on , Talia ! Look , I 'll- - Watch and see . Look , it 's all right , see ? Honest . It 's all right . Come on ! Alan . Alan ! Stay here ! It ' s gas . It 's bubbling up behind the altar . I don 't know what kind it was , but it 's deadly . You know , I thought I could smell something . I didn 't know what it was . It was faint , but bitter . I am sorry . He will die . - Pete ! Pete ! - Oh , man . I 'm floating . Five thousand feet and holding . All right now , take deep breaths , pal . - [ Inhales ] What hit me ? - Some kind of poison gas . How did Brun live ? I mean , he was standing right where Pete was standing . The gods protect the leader . Yeah , right . Man , that stuff hit me like a club . Now what ? Well , that temple looks like it 's built into the mountain . There might be a way out back . What good will that do ? There 's still the gas . Well , the temple 's the only answer . The way I see it , either we go in there or flag down some gorilla and ask him to come and get us . Hey , you remember your chemistry ? It might work , Pete . - What are you doing ? - Some gases are absorbed by crushed charcoal . Okay . See , we wrap this , uh , crushed charcoal ... into a wet cloth and it acts as sort of a filter . Really ? And you can breathe through that ? Well , we 'll find out in a couple of minutes . - Provided we 're not asphyxiated . - All right . Now hold these over your nose and mouth tight and breathe through them . - You ready ? - Everybody ready ? All right , come on ! No ! No . I think it 's all right . I don 't smell the gas in here . Well , lookee here . Hey , how about this ? An old gas mask . This is what they worship . At one time , someone must have discovered that ... - this could keep a man alive around that gas . - Yeah . It must have seemed like some kind of magic to them . [ Chuckles ] Their god wears a gas mask . Their god is a gas mask . Brun must hold his breath till he gets to here . [ Galen ] Unless he knows another way in . What 's that light up ahead ? - Fresh air . - From the tunnel ? Yeah . What 's in here ? Oh , for- - There 's that same smell . It 's coming from there . [ Breathing ] That 's the same stuff from the temple . The gas is being drawn up through here . And then collected in these bottles . This is a do-it-yourself kit for making poison gas bombs . - What are gas bombs ? - Talia , what are these jars used for ? - I have never seen them before . - What are gas bombs ? They 're an efficient gadget , Galen . Instead of killing one person at a time , you can wipe out a whole batch . Instead of killing one person at a time , you can wipe out a whole batch . - You defy the gods ! - [ Virdon ] Wait ! Hold it . If we defy the gods , how come we are still alive ? Only the wearer of this mask can walk in the temple and not be punished . Therefore , you will be punished ! This isn 't one of your god-given masks . Now watch . [ Breathing ] But how can- - How can you ? You are only men . That 's right . Just like you . But how- - how can you walk in the temple with only that and live ? Just as you can with your mask and live . My mask ? It came from the gods ! No . It was made by men when they destroyed other men ... - with gas like this . - You 're lying ! Oh , no , he is not lying . He-He knows about such things . What are you planning to do with these ? When I get enough , I will go to the ape village . My mask will protect me , but they will be killed . You can 't use this gas . You can 't control it . You can start by killing apes , but you can wipe out the whole planet . All our lives we have obeyed , begged and crawled ... and gave up those we loved because the apes were strong . Now the gods have made me strong . I will free my people ! Not this way . You can 't win freedom by destroying the world . I will teach them to make masks like yours . We will fight the apes again ! The gas will kill them , but the masks will save our lives . Man , this poison gas of yours is just the beginning . Sooner or later , the apes will find their own gas and make their own masks . Listen to me . Please , listen . We 've been there . We 've been all through poison gas ... and germ warfare and atomic bombs . When you use them , nobody wins . - Do you side with the apes ? - That 's not the point . Fight to stop slavery , all slavery , but not this way . We will kill only apes . And we won 't stop only in this valley . You mean you want to kill all apes with this gas ? As long as it won 't kill my people , nothing else matters . - Galen ! - He won 't kill my people either . You certainly picked a classic way to settle an argument . You think he 's going to be fonder of apes when he comes to ? Well , I am not going to wait to find out . Talia , Galen , get out of here ! Through that back tunnel ! - This stuff could blow ! - Bombs may be efficient , but I do not like them . - Where-Where am I ? What happened ? - You 'll be all right , Brun . - [ Explosion ] - Wait ! - No ! It can 't be destroyed ! It can 't be destroyed ! - Brun ! Galen , no ! He 's not going to get those bombs ! - Good luck , Talia . - You gonna hand her over to the apes ? No . Even though that 's what my father would have wished . No . No , Miro , not wished . Your father might have thought it was the only way , but he hated slavery . - You can be proud of him . - I am not my father . I make my own way . Which way is that ? I would rather not say in front of him . I won 't repeat anything I hear . My word is as good as yours . Yes . And all apes are not the same either . I plan to meet with the meadow people . Only by banding together and burying our differences ... can we make a new life for ourselves , a decent life . - You were listening . - [ Burke ] We 'll lend a hand , Miro . No . This is our fight . I don 't know if we 'll win . But with the help of the meadow people ... and the people beyond the hills , we can keep fighting . Men must fight where they have their roots . So this isn 't your fight , just as it isn 't his . I 'm not sure it isn 't . I don 't like fighting , but I do like you . Thank you . - Good luck to you . - Good-bye .

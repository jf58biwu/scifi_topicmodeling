 ( Helena ) ' Moonbase Alpha status report , '1,095 days after leaving Earth 's orbit . 'Dr Helena Russell recording . 'A strange and frightening thing is happening . 'Our scanner readings are reacting wildly , 'projecting a weird turbulence of high intensity . 'It is as though a strange presence is among us , taking control . ' Commander ! - There is something out there . - Let 's see it on the big screen . Maya ? - The turbulence is magnetic . - Punch through it . I can 't . ( Koenig ) There 's something there . It 's just a faint , but her vital signs are down . Alan ? - John ? - I 'm all right . Ohh ... Oh ! It 's like ... It 's like thunder . Here ... Turbulence decreasing . Who are you ? 'I am your creator . ' - Yasko , get that image back . - ( Computer beeping ) I 'm sorry . I can 't do any better . It 's all right , you don 't have to bow down and adore me . That 's not our style . - You doubt my credentials ? - You haven 't presented any . Oh , I don 't blame you . But all these highly imaginative works of fiction that you call religion have filled you with false gods . However , I do assure you that I am what you would call " the genuine article " . You look like an artist 's rendition of it , I 'll give you that . Artists have their insights . However , let us discuss these matters in a civilised fashion . Over a meal . That went out with Nero . With Messalina , as a matter of fact . But you are right . It is a little old-fashioned . No , thank you . Pure protein . Tastes like nectar . One glassful is food for a month . Leave it ! You Earthlings were always the most sceptical of my creations . It 's our way . You should know that . Sceptical , cynical me - perhaps that 's why I had a soft spot for you . - Some creatures are tame rabbits . - Too bad . They 'd have been on their knees offering up a sacrificial goat . We 're a bit low on sacrificial goats . However , one thing that does seem to have impressed you is force ! All right ! - All right , whoever you are ... - I told you who I am . Magus , your creator . Whoever you are , what do you want with us ? What I 've always wanted , ever since I first created you - to help you . How ? You have been a great disappointment - all those wars , your wilful squandering of the resources of the planet I gave you , your pollution of it . You said you were going to help us . - I am . - How ? I am going to give you something that I have never allowed to any other species . What is that ? A second chance . Are you going to return us to Earth ? To a new Earth , a new Eden , where you can begin again . New Earth . John ... Beautiful , is it not , Commander ? We have learned to mistrust appearances . It is a quarter the size of Old Earth and its air , water and vegetable life are identical . ( Maya ) What about its sun ? It has a sun like Old Earth 's , and in the same proportion to its size . Why didn 't we see the planet before ? Because I did not wish it . You seem amused , Doctor . It 's just that your answer is so exactly what it should be , if you are what you say you are . The planet is ideal for humankind . Your wanderings are over . Excuse me , but humankind does like to have a look around before it calls a place home . I suggest a team of you visit the planet to see for yourselves . Maya ? My readings indicate he 's telling the truth . - The planet could support us . - Then we could settle there . Its data is identical to what I have about Earth . All right , Magus . We accept your invitation . Excellent ! Then the team should be as follows : yourself as leader , since you are the one to make the decisions . The lovely creature , Maya , must go as scientific officer , naturally , the equally enchanting Dr Russell , as medical officer , and Mr Verdeschi , because whether he knows it or not he is a farmer at heart , like generations of his family before him . I 'm commander . If there are teams to be picked , I pick them . I am commander of a great deal more than this speck of dust . That is the team . Either that , or none . All right , Magus . Alan , while we 're down there , you 're in command . Splendid , then I will transport you to the planet . No . We 'll go in one of our Eagles . Typically stubborn , commendably cautious . An Eagle it shall be . - Tony , check the spacesuits . - That will not be necessary . Check the suits , Tony . Yasko , preparing for lift-off . Have a seat . Clear to lift off , Eagle Four . - You had to have it your way . - That is one of my privileges . Yasko ... Yasko ! Koenig to Alpha . Come in , Alpha . Perhaps my way of transporting you has interfered . It will come back later . Shall we disembark ? Commander Koenig , do you read me ? Do you read me ? Commander Koenig ! Come in , do you read me ? ( Birds chirping ) Oh , John ! The air is totally without pollution . And there don 't seem to be any harmful bacteria . Wow . You could plant grain here and have lasagne come up ! - Do you like it ? - Well , it seems compatible . What about animals ? There are some wild cattle , boar and horses . Enough to start breeding from . - Water ? - Water is pure and plentiful . Fruit grows freely , the soya bean grows wild over the whole planet . It is the Garden of Eden , mark two . You will be very happy here . Well , I 'd like to make a feasibility study of the entire planet before we decide . I 'd like to bring a task force here . - Nobody else will be coming . - What ? The decision has been made . You are my new Adams , my new Eves . Koenig to Alpha . Koenig to Alpha . Come in , Alpha . - There is really no point in that . - We 're great triers , we primitives ! Come in , Alpha ! Up there is your past . - Your future lies here . - We choose our own future . I am your Lord and Creator . You must put your trust in me . People up there need us . I shall provide . They shall not want . Just a minute . The Moon itself - what about that ? The Moon will orbit New Earth , for a time , anyway . Then I shall send it on its way . - But it 's our home ! - This is your home now . Here you will live and love , and from you will spring the new human species - mankind 's second chance . Now , look ... Whoever or whatever you are ... You know who I am . Do not diminish my respect for you . ( High-pitched buzz ) You are blessed among men . For you , this is the first day of creation . ( Yasko ) ' This is Moonbase Alpha . ' Commander Koenig . Come in , Commander Koenig . They 'll be on that planet . It 's the only place they can be . We won 't find them by sitting on our butts here . I 've been monitoring you for a long time . I trust we proved interesting subjects ? Yes . I 've worked out the pair bonding in detail . The pair bonding ? ! Yes , it 's important to establish the right mix of genes . - You plan some genetic engineering ? - Precisely . I decided that you , Helena , shall be Tony 's mate and you , Maya , the commander 's . - Wait a minute ... - What ? - You 've decided ? - Yes . Don 't you think you should have consulted us first ? It 's very bad manners and , besides that , very bad psychology . And bad biology . Are we compatible ? You 've a lot to learn about humanity , Santa Claus . I know all about humanity . Humanity is mine . - Humanity belongs to no one ! - You are all compatible . You and the commander will make a fascinating mix . Psychon and Earth . Your iron intellect , typical of your species , interbred with the commander 's iron will , so typical of his . Those very qualities might get in your way . Your monitoring may not be so good . - Maya is very beautiful , but ... - But you would choose Helena . I am aware of that . But I 'm afraid I cannot sanction it . - We make our own choices ! - Much less often than you think . As for you , my dear , your natural aristocracy , allied to Mr Verdeschi , a man rooted in the rocks and the earth . Your offspring will be remarkable ! Offspring ! You would say that . You couldn 't just say " children " . - You 've forgotten one thing . - What ? We 're not rabbits . There 's something else . If you don 't recognise that , who would ? Oh , love . I know all about love . I invented it . There is just one rule . You are not to leave this glade for the moment . - Why ? - Because I do not wish it . The boundary is defined by that line of rocks . You may not cross it . Besides , there will be no need . Everything to sustain you is here . Reopen communications with Alpha . - I do not wish it . - But we do wish it ! My regrets . And now , I must leave you . It will be good to have a moon . We 've never had one before . You will feel quite at home here . By the way , you 'll find its light has all the old romantic qualities . The Eagle 's disappeared . We couldn 't expect him to miss that trick . - Atomic dispersal . Interesting . - I 'm glad you think so . No , it 's still there . He 's exerting his power to disperse its particles . Like powder dissolving in a liquid . Hey , do you think that ... Well , that he could really be what he says he is - God ? I mean ... Jehovah ? Those are just ... names your kind has given to an all-powerful being you think exists , but you don 't understand . So he could be God ? If he 'd come to Earth a few years back a lot of people would have said so . He 's shown God-like powers . But the way that he 's shown them , his methods ... I don 't know . Two plus two doesn 't make four . Well , let 's go see what his food 's like . - Eagle One ready for lift-off . - ' Alan , are you sure ? ' It 's been 24 hours , Yasko . I 'm going after them . 'Clear to lift off . ' ( Engines whining ) Eagle 1 to Command . Something 's wrong . I haven 't got lift-off . - Well , his food 's not poisonous . - Well , that 's something . Ow ! What the ... ? Try Helena . John . Ohh ... Maya ? Very ingenious . Magnetic field cocoons - positive , negative . He 's making sure we do things his way . He 's paired us off . Yup . It won 't work , Magus ! Do you hear me ? ( Soft , romantic music ) Well , here we go . Little old matchmaker in the sky . Yes ... What ... ? Oh ... I said ... yes . I think I might get some more wood for the fire . ( Music continues ) I wonder who does his arrangements . I wonder too . You know , that 's an interesting theory of yours - that God is just a name for ... for God . Comparative universal theology used to be a hobby of mine . An interesting thing - we managed to find our God , the creator of this universe , to find that he had a God who created a bigger one . Our universe is just a part of it all . Hmm . And another point , about divine power . If we learned to explain it - I mean , understood its mechanism ... I mean ... would we ... regard it ... as divine ? You know we 're being manipulated ? Yes . We are . It 's just simple brainwashing . The music , I mean . That 's what it is . It doesn 't mean a thing . Of course it doesn 't . After all , we ... can 't fight City Hall forever . No . ( Roaring ) ( Grunts and screams ) ( Groans ) ( Grunts ) ( Bellows ) ( Roars ) ( Screaming ) Maya ! ( Grunting and snarling ) Are you all right ? Thank you . - Any time . - Good girl , Maya . The creature went into the cave - left some tracks . Let 's follow them . You were forbidden ! Why do you disobey ? Go back ! Go back ! Go back ! What is it that makes the human species so perverse ? That was quite a show last night . What was it you didn 't want us to see ? I forbade you to leave because I knew the dangers . I did not wish you destroyed before we had begun . What dangers ? The apes or those other things ? Throughout history , your species has been notable for two things - asking interminable questions and injuring itself . You haven 't answered . You were homeless , I gave you a home . - I gave you hope . - We were never without hope . - What more could you ask for ? - Free will . Free will ! It is a phantom , a will o ' the wisp . - It exists nowhere in the universe . - We had it before you took it away . To you , free will is the right to say no . It is the right to leave here without you acting like something from Job . It is the right to try . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Helena ! Are you all right ? - Maya . - I 'm OK . We 've hit force fields before . Congratulations . You 're a big , big physicist ( ! ) What is it you don 't want us to see ? We know there are other beings here . Eventually , we 'll get close to them . The ban was for your protection . Last night , did it look as if we needed your protection ? I know that to erect any barrier in front of the human species is to challenge them to cross it . However , this is one barrier that will not be crossed . You can 't keep a force field up for ever . I can . I can ill afford to , but if you behave like children , you must be treated like them . Let us not quarrel . Enjoy yourselves . What was it you used to say on Old Earth , " Make love , not war " ? - We 've got to get out of this zoo ! - Even if we break the force field , anything we try he 'll know - like last night . - How did he know about that ? - ESP ? No . No , I don 't think so . I scanned him just now . There 's some kind of power source inside him . - An organic source ? - No . It 's an implant , fantastically potent . I don 't know how it works , but it 's mechanical . Mechanical ? It 's a device ... So his powers are physical , not psychic . What did he mean , he could " ill afford the energy " ? His powers are beyond our understanding , but they 're not limitless , and he has an awful lot to do . Like what , for instance ? Like he can hold this planet together . Look ! The Moon is much bigger in relation to this planet , and much closer . The gravitational pull . Magus must be countering it or this planet would blow apart . Yeah . And he 's stopping anyone coming from Alpha , right ? Right . We must get out of here - get to those tracks outside , anything to give us a clue as to what 's going on . Yeah . Wait a minute ... I wonder ... Maya ... a bird could do it . An owl , I think , for its eyesight . Maya ... You scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours . Good luck . Additional boosters in place , Yasko . 'OK , Alan . ' I 'm going up to full power ! An owl . I thought you were all extinct down here . The more I learn , the less I know . Away you go . - He caught you and let you go ? ! - Mmm . Which proves he 's not supernatural . Did you find any tracks ? The same ones , inside the glade as well . - Where ? - Over there , behind some bushes . I saw it from the air . Come on . These rocks have only just been put here . - Like it was blocked very recently . - We 're still in the force field . This cave might connect with the one outside . If it does , we can get out of this glade . Lasers ! Now ! Come on , stay close behind . Which way now ? ( Growling ) Quiet . ( Growling ) ( Snarling and growling ) ( Hissing ) Stay here . Please ! Shoot ! What ? You would be doing what I desire . Why did you attack us ? So that you might kill us ! That is why our kind go and fight the ape-things . - He won 't let us die . - Who won 't let you die ? M-Magus . He is the last of the line of cosmic magicians . They could perform miracles through physics . - What does he want ? - He wants the secret of creation . To be able to create life . We mutants are the result of Magus 's attempts to discover that secret ! We 're the ... children of other species he 's trapped and brought to this planet , the results of his manic probing into our earliest fertilised cells . - He won 't even let us die . - Why ? He still ... thinks he may learn something from our ... mutilated genes . Down here is the only place we can get away from him . He 'll never come down here . Is there a way through the caves leading out of the glade ? Thank you . Helena , Maya ! Deceitful pygmies ! - Is he all right ? - Maya , no . An immature and irresponsible reaction ! Last time we met , you were an owl , I believe . I 'm afraid your species ' mastery of the molecular trick slipped my mind . So you take your revenge like a child . You take me too lightly . You need a lesson . This is your Garden Of Eden , is it ? And those are your Adams and Eves . You would use us like lab animals . No , that was not my purpose . You 're a bungler who creates misery ! My purpose is to create a new species of mankind - strong , resourceful , brilliant , dedicated . All the qualities you possess between you . We will work on the mystery of creation . I realise now I cannot solve it on my own . Call yourself a creator ? You 're a fraud and a liar . A mild deception to gain your confidence . - You didn 't . - I admire humankind . - It 's not mutual . - I have been among you many times . I was Simon Magus , who offered to buy the Nazarene 's powers . I was Merlin , I was Nostradamus , I was the magician who contended in magic with Moses . No doubt . When the time comes , I will invest you and your offspring with the powers that I possess . - You will help me . - Help you ? - Help you to do that ? ! - Either you will agree to my terms or I will destroy your companions on the Moon . Not even you can destroy the Moon . I can destroy your base . Your life support . ( Alarms bleeping ) Repair crew to section eight ! Repair crew ! ( Yasko ) Why ? Well , maybe to put pressure on John . Stop ! You agree to my terms ? I ... I agree to talk about it . You are a realist . We will discuss it tomorrow . - I think I 've got it . - What ? A way out ? I don 't know . Let me try it out on you . He had us whipped - he knew it . Yet he wouldn 't press home his advantage . Why ? - Because he can 't stand the dark . - What ? He 's afraid of the dark ? Last night he left before dark , he won 't go in the caves and what about the effect of the laser ? - He drew strength from it . - Right . Of course ! He needs light . His power comes from light ! So he 's on the other side of the planet , where the sun is shining . But we saw him last night when we crossed the boundary . No , that was a projection of himself . The implant I detected could be a light decelerator . A what ? Imagine light travelling at 186,000 miles per second . For you , I 'll try anything ! You find a way to slow it down as it 's coming at you , then you harness the energy . I didn 't think that was possible . It isn 't , for us . But they managed to solve it . That 's why they 're super-beings . It must be some ... small crystal planted somewhere in his brain stem . The energy would be instantly available then . And directed simply by thought . Unlimited personal power . Must be the nearest thing there is to being God . How do we fight that ? Find some way to cut off his source of power - to block out the light . - How ? - By being primitive . It 's last thing he 'll expect . - Magus will be here soon . - We 've gotta make sure it works . - Got it ? - Yup . OK . Hang on . - Got it ? - Got it . - John ? - All right , cover it up . ( Koenig ) It 's a total blackout . Black as pitch ! If this doesn 't work , or Magus suspects , it 's the end of all of us , and Moonbase Alpha . I know , Tony . - You have considered ? - Yes , we have considered . You will cooperate in my work ? Magus , we don 't trust you . Why should we put ourselves at your mercy ? I need you . I cannot do it alone . This is your guarantee . All right , Magus . But these are the conditions . No experiments on the mutants , not even observations . Valuable things may still be learned from them ! Mistakes can be more instructive than successes . Those are our conditions and that is our ultimatum ! As always , the arrogance of your species astounds me ! And the horror of your deeds astonishes us ! How dare you ? ! Primeval imbeciles ! Without me , the planet will break apart ! Light ! Give me light , or we 'll all die ! Koenig to Alpha ! Come in , Alpha ! ( Wind howling ) Come in , Alpha ! Only Magus 's power is holding this planet together against the pull of our moon . Koenig to Alpha ! Come in , Alpha ! Koenig to Alpha ! John ! John ! ( Yelling ) The mutants ! You get aboard the Eagle . I 'll meet you there ! Go on ! Come on ! Come on ! We 'll take you back with us . No ! No ! Thank you , no ! This is the best thing for us ! All of you ! You go ! Go ! Go ! ( Yelling ) - Commander ! - Helena ! Got to get going ! One chink of light as the Earth broke up and he 'd still get away . That 's a real long shot , isn 't it ? - Would you like to bet against him ? - Nope .

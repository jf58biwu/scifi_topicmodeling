 JOHN : I 'll take it now . LIZZIE : No , it 's all right . I can manage . JOHN : My turn . I 'll take it up to the corner . LIZZIE : All right . Careful . JOHN : I think I 'm going to enjoy it here . There 's much more for us to do . Pet says I can do the milking , too . She 's going to teach me how to hold the udders . LIZZIE : The teat , silly . JOHN : What ? LIZZIE : You hold the teat . The udder is the big bag that holds the milk . Teats are the things on the outside . JENNY : Hello . GREG : Hi . ( GREG SIGHS ) Well , hello , funny face . - You all right ? - Hmm . I 've got a bit of a headache . Pet keeps coming in and feeding me endless cups of carrot tea . - That 's what 's causing the headache . - You 're right . JENNY : She 's nice though , isn 't she ? - Who , Pet ? - Hmm . Yes . Yes she is . - What have you been doing ? - Hedging . - I 'm frozen . - Ooh ! ( CHILDREN PLAYING OUTSIDE ) - You warm enough ? - Mmm . I 'm fine . They seem happy enough . I 'd like to stay , Greg . Well , we 're going to stay until spring , anyway . I can 't think we 'd be better off anywhere else . You 've been brainwashed by Pet . Well , Charles wants to expand . Yes , I know . What does funny face over there want to do ? I think it 's time funny face got a name . All right . What do you want to call him ? - Mmm ... David ? - David . How does that appeal to you , David ? You really do want to stay , Jenny ? Yes . Yes , I do . I feel safe here . All right . Oh . Bread , wine , oil lamps . Very organised . Yeah . Well , it could be even more organised with more people . Create a division of labour . Yes , well , that 's what I wanted to talk about . Ah . - You decided to stay ? - Yes . Tell me , was it you yourself , or the family man ? - The family man . - Ah . Still , I don 't think you 'll regret it . Not with this class of wine . - Now , what should we drink to ? - What indeed ? Civilisation . - All of us . - Hmm . - Private party , or can anyone join ? - Just in time . - They 've decided to stay . - I am glad . - How 's the baby ? - Oh , he 's fine . He 's got a name now . David . New toast . David . - David . - David . Ta . I can 't work with you standing next to me . Well , don 't work , then . - Can people still love each other ? - Mmm . Charles is so basic . - Always going on about breeding . - I know . Like animals . Charles has got his own idea of what love is . - Do you love me ? - Yes . Different though , innit ? - You mean nowadays ? - Yeah . But what ? - You 're going to be a doctor . - So ? You 'd never have looked at me twice . Times were different . - You 'd noticed ? - Yeah . - You got a smaller choice . - Yes , I 'm just slumming . What about you ? Oh , I always did fancy nurses . Cheeky devil . What you 've got to remember is that the old class distinctions have gone . So forget about the doctor bit . - But I don 't want to . - Why ? Makes you more exciting , doesn 't it ? I see I 'm going to have problems with you . You can have goes on my horse . Oh , come on , it 's not the end of the world . What 's the matter , John ? What 's the matter ? Jack 's killed Tommy . - Who 's Tommy ? - His horse . Oh , dear . Why did Jack do that ? He broke his leg . Listen , John , if a horse is injured and its leg is broken , and we can 't mend it , and we can 't , isn 't it better to put him out of his misery ? ( SOBBING ) I suppose so . He wouldn 't want to spend the rest of his life a cripple , would he ? Mining engineers , one . Veterinary surgeons , one . Nurses , 70 . Architects , three . Hmm . You 're one third of the world 's architectural talent , Charlie . No , no . This is just Britain , from these 1966 census figures . Oh . One survivor in 5,000 ? Approximately . I tried to make a census once . We toured the area , traced the survivors , found out where they lived . Well , what happened to it ? Uh , we got overtaken by events . - Again ? - Yes . Do you think I can have another go ? Just to correlate special skills , to find out what we still need here . Afterwards , of course , it could become much more important when we begin to expand . You don 't have to convince me , Arthur . - Do you think it 's a good idea ? - Yes , I do . Oh . ( DOOR OPENING ) - Have you seen Ruth ? - No . Jenny 's not feeling very well . RUTH : Jenny . What 's the matter ? It 's my headache . It 's suddenly worse . Anywhere else ? Any pain anywhere else ? Mmm . - Down here . I feel faint . - I see . And she was sick half an hour ago . I don 't know if that 's any help . Let me see your hands . Now , close your eyes . - Can you see anything ? - No , just giddy . You can open again now . Any ideas ? Well , Jenny 's a bit sweaty . Obviously her temperature 's up . You 've got a bit of low blood pressure , Jen . - We 'll have to build you up . - Get some bottles of stout for you . Could you give me a few minutes with her , Greg ? Oh , sure . The headache on its own doesn 't mean much . But she 's got symptoms of low blood pressure . - Well , go on . - She 's had a slight haemorrhage . I think some of the placenta has got left behind and it 's reacting . What 'll happen ? She needs an operation , to remove it . Can you do that ? - Not without certain things . - Like what ? Forceps , sedatives . One or two other things . We can get a sedative in a chemist , can 't we ? Yes . But not the rest of the stuff . - Well , where , then ? - RUTH : A hospital . - A maternity hospital ? - Not necessarily , a general hospital . Well , we got to be certain . It 's too dangerous , hopping around . I went into London only three months after . Packs of wild dogs , rats . Got to get in quick and get out quick . Yes , but the corpses will have gone by now . Yeah , but the animals won 't . Look , let 's just decide where we 're going , shall we ? Hang on now , there 's no point in going into town if we get everything we want from a cottage hospital . We mustn 't waste any time . How do we know we 're going to be able to get everything locally ? We don 't . We need sealed bottles of sterile water to go with the antibiotics . Most of them will have been used up in the Death anyway . So it has to be somewhere that once held huge stocks . City hospital . CHARLES : So it 's no good wasting time chasing around the country . Even then , not being certain . CHARLES : So it 's got to be a city , not a town . - Birmingham 's the best bet . - GREG : And how long will that take ? CHARLES : With a good horse , half a day there . Right . Well , you tell me what we need , Ruth , and I 'll get off . - Hang on , Greg , I don 't think you ... - Look , Jenny 's my responsibility . There 's no need for anyone else here to take a risk . Anyway , whoever goes , it 's too late to set out now . It 'll be dark soon . And I 've still got to make a list of what 's wanted , explain where to look for it and what it looks like . Hmm . Yeah , she 's right . It 's pointless running the risk tonight . - But she 'll be all right ? - I know very little about this , Greg . We must plan as best we can . Greg , Jenny 's asking for you . I still think he 'd be more use to Jenny here . I 'll go . First thing in the morning . Greg doesn 't need to know anything about it , does he ? I thought you said you were sick of cities . Now , why don 't I go ? I know something of what to look for . We need somebody who can ride a horse , not a bike . - Thanks very much . - Paul 's right . - I 'll start these notes . - Yes , Doctor . God , I hope it 's warmer where you 're going . - Don 't forget to change your socks . - Okay . And don 't drink the water . - You got the maps ? - It 's okay , they 're in there . I 'll take the short route . Up the motorway . - ( LAUGHS ) Don 't get done for speeding . - Okay . Come on ! Good luck . ( MOANING ) Jenny . Jenny . - It hurts . - Yes , but it 's all right . Paul 's gone to get the drugs . He 'll be back ... Don 't fight the pain , Jenny . Don 't struggle . It was his own choice . He offered to go . - Don 't have a baby , Pet . - It 'll be all right . I think it 's childbed fever . If it is , the penicillin and the streptomycin should do it . I thought for a minute she was going into coma . Is there a doctor in the country ? I feel totally inadequate . You 're doing the best you can . I 'll make you a drink . You better make some sort of bottle for the baby , Greg . Jenny won 't be able to feed him now . Sure . I miss Abby . Yes . ( CHUCKLING ) Census ? - Just name , address and special skills . - Name , rank , number , eh ? - That 's right . - Then I get a clocking-on card . No . Well , what 's it for ? Posterity ? If we 're going to expand ... And failing to comply with your request ? I just thought we ought to have some documentation . Ah , then the income tax and the rates ! I know you 're a carpenter , but you may have other skills . All right , as long as it 's not bosses and workers all over again . - Right . Name ? - Jack Percival Wood . - Previous address ? - 13 Derby Street , Poplar , E7 . - Previous occupation ? - Docker . - Anything else ? - Shop steward . - That 's not a job . - Special skill . Disruptive tactics . It 'll be used again if you ever become chief tyrant . I was thinking of something more constructive . Well , I was very good at mending bike punctures . How 's that ? West Ham supporter ? All right , do some home electricity and some bricklaying . Thanks very much , Jack . Now , if you ever get tired of administration , I can always teach you how do a mortise and tenon joint . I 'll remember that . ARTHUR : " That Tom , who had thought her very handsome , said to himself , " ' Handsome is that handsome does , ' " and slipped in between the water lily roots as fast as he could , " and then turned round and made faces at her . " ' Come out , ' said the wicked old otter , or it will be worse for you . " But Tom looked at her from between two thick roots " and shook them with all his might , " making horrible faces all the while , just as he used to ... " ( BABY CRYING ) Oh . Shh . There 's a clever boy . Come on . Drink some more milk . Come on . Come on . " ' ... which nothing eats , not even those vulgar pike in the pond . ' " ' I am not an eft , ' said Tom . 'Efts have tails . ' " ' You are an eft , ' said the otter very positively . " ' I see your two hands quite plain and I know you have a tail . " ' - What 's an eft ? - Um ... Well , I think it 's a sort of lizard , a kind of newt . - You haven 't been listening . - I have been listening . All right ? " ' I tell you , I have not , ' said Tom . ' Look here . ' " And he turned his pretty little self quite round , " and sure enough , he had no more tail than you . " I was just thinking about Jenny . Is she getting better ? Yes , she is . When can we see the baby ? Well , Pet will tell you when you can go in . It may not be today . - Carry on with the story please , Arthur . - Thank you very much . " The otter might have got out of it by saying that Tom was a frog . " But then , like a great many other people , " when she had once said a thing , she stood to it , right or wrong . " ( PAUL SIGHS ) Nothing 's that simple . Got to leave you , old son . Sorry . Stay right here , I 'll come back . Don 't worry about me , I 'll hitch a lift . She keeps drifting , but she 's still conscious . Peritonitis could set in . It 's John 's birthday the day after tomorrow , same as Paul 's . - What time is it ? - 5 : 30 . It 'll be light in an hour . LIZZIE : Can I , please ? JOHN : Me after . PET : You know , you really have to work very hard . LIZZIE : What 's it like ? PET : Well ... Is he back ? LIZZIE : Oh , yes . A fantastic right foot shot . Look ! Lizzie , look , there 's Paul . Paul ! Paul ! Paul 's back ! JOHN : He 's back ! LIZZIE : Paul 's back ! JOHN : We saw him . The horse went lame . No . - Got a fever or something ... - Did you get the stuff , Paul ? ( PANTING ) Yeah , got it . How is she ? - Not bad . - Were you bitten by anything ? No . Could be a cold , I suppose . CHARLES : I 'll give you a hand with that stuff . RUTH : Now , hold on . Paul , you got the penicillin and the streptomycin ? - Yeah . - And the tetracycline tablets ? Think so . What about the sealed bottles of sterile water ? - Yeah , I got those . - Syringes ? - Yeah , I got all that . Forceps . - CHARLES : Good lad . And a large bottle of bicarbonate of soda . Well , Pet will thank you for that . Where can he stay tonight till we know what 's wrong ? - One of the outhouses ? - We use them . I know . Paul , could you manage by yourself up in the hay barn ? Should think so . Can you hold on here for a bit while we get some blankets organised and get some food up there for you ? - I 'll do that now , all right ? - PAUL : Yes . Okay . Leave the saddlebag on the ground . Keep the others for now . When I 've sorted out what Jenny needs , I 'll come to the barn and make sure you give yourself an injection , all right ? You 'll be all right . How long have you been like this ? Two or three hours . - It 's probably exhaustion . - I 'm thirsty . It 'll take a little time to get the barn ready and the injections organised . I 'll start you on penicillin . I told you to change your socks . Yeah , well , I reckon he found a pub to stay in . Yeah , I was that lucky . See you in a bit . Well , that 's the sedative . And then what ? Then we remove the placenta . And give a combination of penicillin and streptomycin . If that doesn 't work , we 'll try the tetracycline . One of them should do it . I better go get Paul fixed up . - Is the barn ready ? - Yeah . Arthur 's told him he can go in . - Pet . - Hmm ? Go to bed , Pet . Go to bed . Paul ? Paul . Paul . It 's time for your injection , my love , come on . I left the horse . That 's it . Now syringe . Get the horse back . I left it in a field , up on the top road . I will . Now , into the water bottle . That 's it , that 's right . Draw it up . Good . - You 'll get it back ? - I will , I promise . The blue one . Now , pump the water into it . Draw it back up . That 's right . Make sure all the air 's out . That 's it . Once more . That 's right , good . CHARLES : Now , Paul is spending today and tonight in the barn . Maybe tomorrow , too , it all depends how he is . But Ruth is very , very clear on one thing . Nobody is to go near him . All right ? - JOHN : Yeah . - Good . - I thought you were in bed . - I 've had a sleep . - Go on . - CHARLES : Right . Ah , where was I ? Oh , yes , all right , then . Now , nobody is to go near Paul , not even to talk to him because he might have a germ and we don 't want to catch it . She 's sleeping . - CHARLES : Can I come in ? - Yes , of course , come on . How 's Paul ? Um ... It was too dark to see . I thought I heard him move . - How 's Jenny ? - I 've got the placenta . But we 'll have to wait . CHARLES : I was saving that for a special occasion . For a bigger world . Better days . You know , in primitive societies , natives used drugs to ease the pain of existence . Well , we needed more or less the same thing , I suppose . Isn 't that what a civilisation was , just a ... A vast support system to ease the pain ? Just a year ago . Seems like a lifetime . How adaptable will we become , Greg ? Or will we become brutalised ? Well , I knew a Dutchman , stockbroker , big jovial kind . During the war , he had been in a German concentration camp . I think it was Belsen . He lost his mother there . But when I met him , he was living in luxury and , he remembered all the horrors , but somehow ... Somehow they just weren 't real any more . How long was he in Belsen ? A year . Hmm . - Any glasses ? - Yeah . Paul , I 'm here . How do you feel , love ? ( PAUL MURMURING ) What ? Where does it hurt ? Tell me . In your neck ? Anywhere else ? Under your arms ? Touch under your arms , what can you feel ? ( SPEAKING SOFTLY ) Lumps . In your neck as well ? Paul , you must give yourself another injection straightaway . Not penicillin . The red bottle , streptomycin . Please , love . Get the syringe . The second one , not the first one you used . Now , get one of the water bottles . You must break the seal . Now press the plunger into the bottle . Come on , come on . That 's it . Good boy . I 've given Jenny her drugs . She 's going to be fine . You saved her , love . You did a marvellous job . Oh , what 's this ? I 'm making cakes for John 's party . It 's his birthday today . Ooh , it 's nice . How is he ? He 's not responded to penicillin , so I 've put him on streptomycin . He 's got lumps where his lymph nodes are . It could be adenitis , a streptococcal infection . - Did you have lumps when you were ill ? - No . - Did you , Pet ? - No . Neither did I. Did Paul ever mention his symptoms when he was ill ? Not to me . In pneumonic plague , there aren 't any lumps . In septicaemic plague , I think you get spots on the skin . Bubonic . - Hey , race you to the top of the hill . - Oh ! ( PAUL MOANING ) Hey , there 's Arthur . - Stop , you mustn 't . - LIZZIE : Arthur , Arthur ! ARTHUR : Here , you know you two kids shouldn 't be here . - What 's the matter with Paul ? - He should be in bed . ARTHUR : Here . Give Jack a hand with this . - More work ! - I 'll take the front . No , the front 's too heavy , you take the back . - All right . - What 's the matter with Paul ? Ready , up . John , Lizzie ! John ! ( MOANING ) No . Ruth , Ruth ! Quickly , girl ! Ruth ! Ruth ! - Did they touch him ? - The child may have . Jack , you know the outhouse with tins of DDT powder ? Yeah , I know . Can you get two of those polythene sacks ? - I think there are some in there . - Yeah . Tell the woman to take all her clothes off , and those of the child , and to burn them . They must do that first . Then to get into the sacks and dust herself all over with DDT , the same for the child . Yeah , all right . It 's not working , is it ? RUTH : Up till now , we thought we were immune . Most of us had the disease , and we thought it was a mutant strain of bubonic plague . Paul had it . But whatever he had , whatever we had it , it 's not this . This is bubonic . He 's got lumps and buboes exactly where you 'd expect . Adenitis should have responded to drugs , so should bubonic . So this is yet another mutant . But one thing 's constant . It 's spread by rats , the fleas that live on rats . And this is a farm and Paul is in a barn . And if the lumps suppurate , the fleas will gorge on them . Ruth , are you telling us we 've got to leave ? That 's what the people of Eyam should have done . - Eyam ? - A village in Derbyshire . They shut themselves in . What they should have done was to burn down the village to kill the rats and the fleas . Ruth , we can 't survive that way . They 'd been fed by people from other villages . Well , in our case , there 's no other people . And there 's Jenny , she can 't be moved . JACK : How do we stop it , Ruth ? You stop it by isolating the patient through using strict aseptic technique . - But we can 't do that . - Can 't move him . - When will the lumps suppurate ? - They might not . One thing , it 's winter , fleas like it warm . But there are other factors . Ruth . No , Greg . Well , if Ruth is right , Paul could wipe us all out . Even after death , the body is dangerous . Meaning what ? - Paul 's dying . - Not necessarily . - You haven 't seen him , Greg . - All right , so ? Well , go on , Arthur , say it . You want us to kill him , yes ? - I don 't want to kill him . - Paul 's our friend , Arthur . We survived both plague and fire , remember ? Now he 's just risked his life to save Jenny . So we thank him for that by killing him , yes ? Greg , it is important that we ... How does Ruth know for sure it is bubonic plague ? Go and look at him , Greg . Go and look at him . He 's suffering , Greg . He 's in terrible pain . You asked me if we were all going to become brutalised . Well , perhaps we will if all we think of is survival . JACK : That 's all the paraffin and most of the DDT . Thanks , Jack . What are you doing ? I 'm going to treat Paul . Perhaps he didn 't inject himself properly . What 's in there ? Mixture of DDT and paraffin . And if DDT works , then why not in paraffin ? You 're going to wrap yourself in polythene ? That 's right . And then paint it with the DDT and the paraffin . All right ? Yes . Go and stay with Jenny . LIZZIE : Come on , goat . If I were Charles , I wouldn 't ask him to stay in a barn . - He must be jolly draughty . - Look ! - It 's Ruth . - Ruth ! They 're having a fancy dress party , John . ( BOTH GIGGLING ) Jenny ? ( JENNY MOANS ) Jenny . - PAUL ( SOFTLY ) : Don 't . - Shh . - Jenny ... - Listen , it 's all right . - I 'm sorry . - What ? Paul ? ( SOBBING ) Listen , sweetheart , I can 't . Look , I 'm going to have to give you another injection . Does it hurt ? No . Jenny 's all right . She 's going to be fine . My love . ( SOBBING ) It 's just that I couldn 't find another nurse 's uniform . I love you , Paul . I love you . - I love ... - Yes . - ... you . - Yes , yes . Oh , my love . My love . Sorry , I can 't stop . I 'm rounding up the children for John 's birthday party . Jenny ? Hello . It 's all right , Jenny . You go back to sleep . - Do it to me now , do it to me . - All right , watch it . - Oh , they started without us . - Here . That 'll have to go on the census . - Ah . Thought it might . - Hello . - Jenny 's all right ? - Yes ? Good , I 'll go and tell Paul . - That 's just warmed . - Good . ( CHILDREN LAUGHING ) - Can I have the tinderbox ? - It 's in the workshop . PET : You 're a lucky boy , you know , John . Ruth made this for Paul 's birthday . - Now . - There we are . # Happy birthday to you # Happy birthday to you # Happy birthday , dear John # Happy birthday to you # PET : Come on , stand up and blow out the candle . Make a wish . Come on , blow harder . PET : You help , you help . ARTHUR : Blow it . ARTHUR : Did you wish ? You will keep pieces for the others , won 't you , Pet ? Of course I will . I spy with my little eye something beginning with " T " . Table . PET : Let 's have tea first and then you can play that game . I spy with my little eye something beginning with " B " . - Books . - No . LIZZIE : Boots . JOHN : No . Bonfire . JOHN : Yes . Now , have your tea . - I 've been thinking . - GREG : What about ? - Well , we decided to call him David . - Yes . I 'd like to call him Paul . All right , I don 't mind . - Sure ? - Mmm . Sure . - It 's just that ... - Yeah , I know . Just you rest . Can I see him , and thank him ? I 'm afraid you can 't at the moment , he 's in isolation . Didn 't feel very well when he came back . Where 's Ruth ? I 'll get back to the farm and tell Charles . Right , I 'll be up in the woods . Ruth ! Ruth ! Ruth ! Ruth ! No luck . Well , we 've done everything we can tonight . Up there . Ruth ! CHARLES : Ruth ! - You 've been here all night ? - No . I was going to say , you 'll be frozen . - I found a barn . - And Jenny 's all right . What about the woman and child ? The ones in isolation . They 're all right , too . You did a great job . You do realise that for Jenny 's baby , they 'll be no vaccines for polio , diphtheria , small pox ? Yes . - And I suppose we just have to ... - Put up with it . What 's the point ? Well , I 'd say that what Paul did , in risking his life to save somebody else , that 's the point . - Would you ? - Yes . Considering how brutal and selfish people have been , - I 'd say that that it was a good one . - Good . Well , you remember , or perhaps it may not have happened to you , but , we had people claiming territory , supermarkets , petrol , fights , death . And all because of panic and fear . But now we 're getting more organised , that 's slowed down . People are scarcer and we 're aware of it . And so , perhaps , we 're better to each other . I was going to kill myself . But you didn 't . So , let 's learn from this . From now on , towns are out . We 've got to learn to survive without them . CHARLES : Perhaps we 've all been a bit smug . I know I have . We came through the Death , so we all assumed we 'd got some God-given immunity . Well , we obviously don 't have the resistance to disease that we thought we had . We certainly haven 't been specially chosen to survive . - So , towns are out . - Mmm . Agreed ? GREG : Mmm-hmm . No . Jenny wouldn 't be alive now if towns were out . Well , we know that , Ruth , but we also know that towns are lethal . We can 't just make it a simple rule . What if somebody else is ill and needs drugs and we know they 're to be had in a hospital ? I don 't think we should go . GREG : We can 't foresee how much danger might be involved , Ruth . We can lessen the risk to the community , though . We might decide , sometime in the future , someone might volunteer . It all depends on the circumstances at the time . What do you suggest ? Anybody who goes into a town , for whatever reason , who volunteers to go , when they come back , they go into quarantine . They go at their own risk and they spend time in quarantine when they come back . An isolation ward . All right , but where ? Don 't worry about that . I 'll find somewhere for all that . We build a place . And if strangers come by and we 're not sure if they 're well , they can go into quarantine for ten days before joining the rest of us . Hmm . Somewhere clean and warm , where we can feed them . I 'm not promising a private patient scheme . Well , it 's a good idea , we 'll try it . But , you know , Ruth , it wouldn 't have helped ... No , I know it wouldn 't . Let 's just hope we can do without towns before long . Amen to that . ( BABY CRYING ) What 's he saying , Jenny ? Well , I think he wants to know if he 's on the census yet ! - CHARLES : Arthur ? - Yes , he is . Sex , date of birth . But I haven 't got a name for him yet . We 're calling him Paul . Hey . - I 'm all right . - Sorry . - What are you doing ? - Just sawing up more wood . That 's nice . First things first .

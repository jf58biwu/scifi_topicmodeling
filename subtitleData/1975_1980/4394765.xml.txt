 ( CHARLES WHISTLING ) ( WHISTLING CONTINUES ) Whoa . ( HUMMING ) ( DOGS BARKING ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( HORSE WHINNYING ) ( DOG GROWLING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( GUNSHOT FIRES ) ( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) ( DOGS BARKING ) I 'll get you your horse . ( DISTANT TROTTING ) ( CHUCKLES ) It 's only just broken the skin . There are better ways of committing suicide than carrying meat , especially now we 've got urban dogs . - Urban dogs ? - Mmm , Sheffield and Manchester . Ran out of food there , they 've moved out . Soon have every sheep between here and Buxton . Oh , I 've not been that far north . - Where are you from ? - Down the river , in a valley . People called Walter , do you know them ? - I 'm from upstream myself . - Oh , there are four of us staying there . I 'm trying to find Mrs Walter 's son so we can move on . He 's called Tom . He 's about 25 , I 'm told , big fellow . Lot of big fellows . We 'll have the fire there , away from the dogs . We got to get rid of the meat . Might as well eat it . ( SIGHS ) Since when did people shake hands ? Sorry . I forgot , it 's been a long time since the Death . Things worse than the Death . - Well , my name is Charles Vaughan . - Richard Fenton , for what it 's worth . Where did you get the , uh , automatic ? I liberated an army camp on the moors just after the Death . I 've got more back at my place . I 'll trade you one . ( SCOFFS ) Nothing to trade , I 'm afraid . Then I 'll lend you one . I can 't see you getting the chop after my great rescue , can I ? How can you be so certain that I 'll return it ? Anyone who offers to shake hands is either honest or a fool . And I don 't think you 're a fool . I was very grateful to be alive . - Where do you live ? - About 15 miles further on . - Four of you , are there ? - Yes . - Looking for a friend ? - Yes . - How many times have I heard that ? - What ? People looking for a friend . Are you sure you haven 't seen him ? I meet only those I barter with . Mind you , that 's most people . - Indian trader , selling guns . - That and other things . - I 'll look up my notes when we get back . - Notes ? I amuse myself writing down the ambitions , the ... the fears , the phobias , routes taken , routes proposed . Really ? Well , how long have you been doing that ? Since it all started . Or ended . But you must have the most incredible amount of information . ( CHUCKLES ) Might make a Canterbury Tales one day . Oh , I mean , we had records , but what you 've got must be a record of half a nation . Mmm , certainly a lot of people moving north and south from the Midlands . Well , look , look , what I want to do is , I want to get people to join up , to federate , to use whatever technology we 've got . Thank you . So , of course , any information about movement is vital and you 've got it ! You obviously have a sense of mission . Oh , I can 't be the first person you 've met who talks like that ? Oh , no . I get regional water boarders , clerks , little people with big ideas . ( CHUCKLING ) Oh , I 'm sorry . Obviously , you don 't accept it . Here , let 's make a start . Thank you . It 's not just big ideas . - Hmm . - It 's common sense , it 's fact , it 's survival . What , it 's the indomitable spirit of mankind , the untiring ceaseless urge to progress , improve ? Isn 't that rather old hat now ? I don 't see how you can be so detached . - It keeps me sane . - It doesn 't help people . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , come , Charles . We 're medieval now . After all , what have we had ? The end of our society . The reverse of 1000 years of social , political and economic progress . And people like you understandably come along and talk as though we just had an air raid . Stiff uppers and a cup of tea and we 'll be all right . Oh , no , no , no . That was a terrific shot . You saved my life . Pure luck . ( SCOFFS ) Well , true . I 'm a bad shot . Pure luck . You rather I took a chance and hit you rather than let you catch rabies ? Of course , you wouldn 't know . There 's quite a bit in this area . Animals probably escaped from quarantine in Manchester and Liverpool . You won 't see anything . The dog wasn 't frothing ? Have you not come across rabies ? No . Quite a few people live in this area . Like the dogs , came out from Sheffield and Manchester . They keep sheep , mostly . Rabies is a problem . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) How long is the incubation period ? Mmm , anything from 11 days to a year . A dog jumped at me the other day . Hmm , took the meat right out of my mouth . Impossible to believe . Fortunately , I had my rifle with me . Meat to a dog is like blood to a shark . That won 't do any good . Saliva only has to make contact with the skin . Rabies doesn 't even need you to scratch . If it 's in the bloodstream , it 's too late . - Why didn 't you tell me ? - I thought you 'd know . I was bandaging a fellow up the other day ... Are you a doctor ? Yes , actually , I am . Do you know , in our community , we went through hell without a doctor . We had to go to London even to bring back a medical student . - We had to fight rats , even . - Now you fight dogs . And you can just sit around and be amused ? Well , no ! Sometimes I go out . I trade some ammunition and rescue ersatz political leaders from dogs . - Do you have any medical supplies ? - No . - Have you tried to get any ? - No . - General practice ? - No . So , you 're a specialist ? What do you specialise in ? Education . Sheffield University of Further Education . I 'm a Doctor of Philosophy . ( DISTANT BARKING ) ( GROWLING ) ( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) ( DOG WHIMPERING ) Cannons to the front , cannons behind . We 'd better get cracking . Burn these dogs . If they 've got rabies , they 're as dangerous dead as alive . - What are the chances ? - Well , they didn 't show any signs . Look , if you 're not so keen on cooperating , what ... I mean ... - What keeps me going ? - Yes ! What kept me going before . The human predicament . How people survive , especially without automatic rifles . Think of all the great reformers , missionaries , saints , martyrs , politicians , generals , the pride and ego . CHARLES : All useless ? FENTON : Well , wasn 't it ? Look what survived . The fish in that river , even the dogs . It 's man 's pride that 's fallen . And I just want to organise society because of my pride ? ( LAUGHING ) You don 't understand , it 's mankind ! Been in the wrong boat for 2,000 years , chasing myths . Progress ? What progress ? - You are a nihilist . - No , no , a realist . We live in the ruins of our created world and I 'm a nihilist ? Well , if it 's all so hopeless , why don 't you just kill yourself ? Because I want to see what happens . ( CHUCKLES ) What , like God ? Sitting back and watching to see how we cope ? I 'd have thought if there 's a God , then he 's wrought his Armageddon . And we 're all just going to die out . Aye , I see to you , it 's just a challenge . A gauntlet to be run . A test . Well , I don 't like watching . I prefer action . ( LAUGHING ) Charles Vaughan . Survivor . Survival pack , two silver dollars , a pair of nylons , chewing gum and prophylactics . Perhaps . But I have a memory of a more comfortable world . I leave you to yours . Thanks . Charles ! Are you afraid ? - No , I 'm angry . - What about your automatic ? I met a fellow like you , arguing about restoration , he 'd been up in a balloon to do it . A balloon ? When was this ? What was his name ? A fanatic . He even tried to tell me he 'd been to Norway . Greg Preston ! When was this ? - You mean he had been to Norway ? - Yes ! What did he say ? What was he doing ? Well , he ... He said he was looking for coal . - Coal ? - Open cast mining . I told him there were two or three in the area . Could he still be here ? - I am now useful to the race ? - Oh , yes . We get to your place before tonight ? No , you 'll have to join me at my halfway house . I 'm quite enjoying our discussion . Come on ! ( CLEARING THROAT ) I have the last Times ever printed . Inflation reaches 28 % . Oh ! Shall I tell you what will happen ? Typhoid , cholera , more plague . Possibly the product of antibiotic drugs and food . Even fewer will survive than in feudal times . Child mortality will exceed child survival . Eliot was right , we 'll end not with a bang but with a whimper . Mmm-mmm , I don 't accept that . I know . And I envy you . Is that why you don 't care about using up matches ? Not yet . I 'm bent on using up matches . I 'm selling my rifle as an ammunition for bread and cheese . When I can 't buy food any longer , then I 'll accept the inevitable . I wish I 'd never met you . Talk like that . Undermines , eats away . And you will be the same when the time comes . All it means is you 'll last longer than me , fight longer and harder to survive , but there 'll be the point when you 'll lie down . ( FENTON PANTING AND GROANING ) ( GROANING CONTINUES ) Caught a fever or something . Don 't come too near . I 'll sweat it out . Here . Here , I got you a drink of water . No ! I don 't want ... No ! No ! ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING LOUDLY ) ( DOOR OPENING ) CHARLES : I 've got your horse ready . If we don 't leave now , we won 't be there before dark . Or you can tell me where you live . I 'll go and get help . Fear of water ... ( MOANING ) - Just tell me ... - Oh , God help me . God help me , God help me , God help me , God help me . ... where you live . ( MUMBLING ) What does it mean ? ( SOBBING ) Fear of water . - Can you get to your horse ? - God , God help me . - Look , if you can get to your horse ... - God help me , please . I 'll ... ( MUMBLING ) Please ! Please ! Go outside . Get me my rifle . End sooner than I expected , Charles , might as well . Get me my rifle , please . Dog touched me on the face . Too late . I 've got rabies ! ( EXHALES ) ( DOOR OPENING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( CHARLES GRUNTING ) ( FENTON MUMBLING ) Now , you listen , listen to me . I 've got to get help for you . First , I must know where you live . Can 't you hear me , Richard ? I must get to your notes . Now , listen , hang on . I 'm going to get help . ( MOANING ) ( THUDDING ) Uh , good morning . My name is Charles Vaughan . I 've got a friend who 's sick about a mile up the valley . - What 's he sick of ? - I don 't know . Is there anywhere around here where I can get some drugs , anyone with nursing experience ? Not interested . - He might die ! - Nothing new . ( MAN HAMMERING ) He 's got lots of rifles and ammunition . - Where ? - Where he lives . If you can help me get him there , you can take what you like . What kind of rifles ? Automatic , latest , lethal stuff . - What 's his name ? - Fenton . Richard Fenton . Why didn 't you say ? - Why , is he important ? - No , he 's a friend . Around here , get your own and nobody else 's . That 's the way we go . - Do you know where he lives ? - Aye . Will you help me get him there ? Not for his rifles . I 'm not interested in his rifles . He 's got some information about a friend . We 'll see , won 't we ? ( GRUNTING ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( PANTING ) You maniac , it 's rabies ! Get some water . ( SCREAMING ) The river ! ( LAUGHING ) ( LAUGHING CONTINUES ) Oh , it 's safe here . He won 't come near water . We 've got to get those guns . Fill that . I 'll keep him off . You go get the horses . ( LAUGHING ) Water ! The water ! ( GROANING ) ( PANTING ) The lot ! ( SCREAMING ) ( GROANING ) ( GUNSHOT FIRES ) ( SIGHS ) SANDERS : Did you touch him ? You tied him up . Your coat 's ripped . Barbed wire . Take it off . Go on . Let 's see your arm . Turn it round , other side . How 'd you get that ? - Dog bit me , it wasn 't rabid . - SANDERS : When ? - Months ago . - Same dog that bit him ? - He wasn 't bitten . - How , then ? Dog stole some meat from him . - How long have you been with him ? - Only met him today . And you tied him up today ? - CHARLES : I wore gloves ! - Why ? To be careful . SANDERS : You said you didn 't know what he 'd got . I didn 't ! If you die , you 'll be eaten by dogs . Now , they go for our sheep and us . You 're a time bomb , I 'm sorry . Turn round . You 'll feel nothing . You don 't want to end up like him , do you ? Turn around . ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) Jolt ! Jolt ! Hyah ! Go on ! ( GROANS ) ( CHARLES EXCLAIMING ) ( PANTING ) ( GROANING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) SANDERS : Hold on , now . ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) SANDERS : Did you hit him ? JIM : I think so . SANDERS : Well , if he 's bleeding , the dogs will get him . Then we 've got another big outbreak . JIM : We 'll just have to nail him first . ( BOTH PANTING ) ( GROANING ) ( PANTING ) ( GASPS ) ( PANTING ) Hey ! Ah ! I ... I got thrown from my horse . About a mile back . Oh , aye ? ( CHUCKLES ) Haven 't seen one of these for ages . How do you manage with punctures and things ? You find it difficult getting hold of glue and stuff ? No , not really . - I used to race these . - Oh , aye ? Yes , I ... I finished up with a titanium bike . Very expensive . ( SNIFFS ) Hmm . Well ... Hey ! ( SIGHS ) ( EXHALES ) ( PANTING ) ( CLOSING DOOR ) ( SIGHS ) Hello . I 'm looking for a friend . His name is Richard Fenton . Lives round here . Do you know where ? Mr Fenton ? ( GRUNTS ) PHIL : Or did he double back ? SANDERS : He couldn 't have . JIM : Well , I just went up there . Well , you keep a watch on the ridge and I 'll keep a watch this side . He can 't have got far . He 's not down here , any road . I mean , he could have cut across top . PHIL : I still say he doubled back . SANDERS : He wouldn 't double back . JIM : What about Dick Fenton 's place ? The rifles , let 's have a look . SANDERS : Well , he wouldn 't come here , he 'd know we 'd be onto him . He 's not here . We 'll pick the riffles up on the way back . ( DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE ) ( EXHALES ) " To Norway . " To Norway . " To Norway , oh the fame , " the messianic dreamer , " he must bring us Him . " Today , - " Gregory ... " - FENTON : Today , Gregory , an idiot , another missionary , rushing headlong through the centuries , backwards , he has seen coal and all will be revealed , I tell him to go three miles east . Some open cast mining , he goes cheerfully , so ordinary and sober , he is most perfect in his madness . ( DOGS BARKING ) ( GROWLING ) ( GUN FIRES ) ( DOGS BARKING ) SANDERS : Nobody 's seen him ? PHIL : Nobody 's seen him down this way . He could be hiding out . Could 've fallen somewhere , anywhere . Well , just in case , Phil , you go round the back , Jim , take the front and I 'll go right . And watch out , he might have got those rifles . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANING ) ( MAN LAUGHING ) ( LAUGHING ) Bad doggie ! Bad doggie ! What you doing here ? I don 't know . - Don 't come . Stay . Stay . - I ... Stay ! Stay ! Naughty dog . You 've been fighting , eh ? Bloody ? Naughty dog ! Naughty dog ! Stay ! ( SHUDDERING ) No ! Tell Ellen , tell Ellen . ( GROANS ) ( CHARLES EXHALES ) ( COW MOOING ) Eat it . ( METAL CLANKS ) Eat it . ( GRUNTS ) No fever ? - Where am I ? - My barn . Lucky Ron found you . Sanders and his lot would shoot you out of hand . You can 't blame them . Precautions . They wouldn 't do that because they 're frightened . You have to live with it some time to know what to do . Where did it bite you ? - No ... - Come on . ( SIGHS ) ( GRUNTING ) - ELLEN : Through that ? - Hmm . Was it frothing , shaking foam ? No , no . Face is the worst place . Let me see your arm . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( SIGHS ) It 's hardly broken the skin . The teeth would be dry biting through all that cloth . - You were wearing the coat ? - Oh , yes . Was there any foam on your coat ? Not like Fenton . He got rabies . Yes , I know . The saliva , what colour ? No , the dog wasn 't frothing . I think your chances are very good . How did you come to know so much about rabies ? I was a farmer 's wife in Kenya . I 've seen a man die from a jackal bite on his face . Face is the worst place . The lower down the bite , the better the chance of recovery . ( SIGHING ) Oh . ( EXHALES ) Oh ! ( CHUCKLES ) You can stay here a few days . Can you ride a horse ? Better than walking . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , good . ( HORSES GALLOPING ) Ron ? Get under the sacks , quickly . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( WHISPERS ) Stay there , keep quiet . All right . Haven 't you found him yet ? Heard he was coming this way . You haven 't seen him , have you , Ron ? ( LAUGHING ) I 'd try down by the quarry , or the caves . You watch out for him , a man with a bad leg and bad arm . He 's got a bad disease . Kill you . ( URGING HORSE ) ( GRUNTING ) That way . I 'll be back , I promise . Yes . Now , go . Ellen ! Come on . Come on . Phil , it 's all right , he hasn 't got it . He ... ( LAUGHING ) ( GROANS ) ( GROANING ) Come on , now ! Hyah ! Come on ! ( GROANING ) Oh ! ( PANTING ) ( HISSING ) ( HORN BLARING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) Goodbye , Alfreda , and thank you . Good luck . Ah ! The first time a railway company has waited all day for one passenger . ( LAUGHS ) I 'll write to head office and thank them . You still going south ? Aye . Just 24 miles , though . That 's what we 've got of line . - Well , it 's nice to see it back . - Aye . Look , then you get on to the main lines , get all the preserved steamers going , start a national network . Oh , big job , that . Funny you should say that though , isn 't it , Terry ? - You what ? - That chap said the same , didn 't he , get a national network going ? Aye . Aye , he did . - " Steam for survival " , he said . - What was his name ? Um ... What was his name , Terry , that chap ? - Greg somebody . - Aye . - DRIVER : Tall ? Fair ? - Aye , aye . - DRIVER : Bit posh , like ? - Hmm . DRIVER : Come on , we 'll give you a hand . Ah , thank you . Did he say where he was going ? - Who , that chap ? - Aye . No , he didn 't . But he said he 'd be coming back . - Did he say when ? - No . - Friend of yours ? - Yes , yes , he is . Bad fall from a horse . Worst I 've seen ! Steam saved me , steam for survival . May I ? Oh , be my guest . ( HORN BLARING ) ( LAUGHING )

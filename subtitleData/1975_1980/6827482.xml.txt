 ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( BEEPING ) NARRATOR : This is Washington , New Washington , a thriving colony on the surface of the moon . We no longer have need of your intergalactic warship . Not today , but maybe tomorrow . For what purpose ? To wage war with the universe ? No , Senator Smedley , for the defense of our moon colony . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) John , this is total madness . This creation of yours , Starstreak , it hasn 't even been tested . We don 't even know if the damn thing will fly . That 's my responsibility , Senator . And my responsibility is to the Moon Council and to the Master Computer . I can reason with Lomax . Cargo vessel Phobos 4 , you are entering Lunar Area 7-5 . Please confirm docking orbit . John , I 'm trying to do you a favor . I 'm telling you what the council have already decided . The Starstreak Project is dead . Let 's see what Lomax has to say , shall we ? Phobos 4 , please acknowledge . This is Lunar Space Control . Phobos 4 , confirmation of docking orbit negative . We are overriding and beginning cobalt reverse drive in 10 seconds . ( ALARM BLARING ) ( ALARM CONTINUES ) ( MACHINES POWERING DOWN ) Master Computer Lomax , this is Lunar Space Control . We have an emergency . Delta 3 cargo vessel on crash course . Probable impact , New Washington center port . Master Computer confirms crash course New Washington in 12 minutes . Suggest full emergency procedures . MAN ON PA : Your indulgence , citizens . The New Washington Cultural Exchange Committee ... ( BEEPING ) is pleased to announce a performance tonight at the Joey Ramone auditorium . Jason Caball here . WOMAN : This is Lunar Space Control . We have an emergency . Please report . Okay , on my way . What 's the problem , Kim ? The problem is Delta 3 cargo ship with 10 metric tons of RADIC-Q-2 on board on crash course with New Washington . - When ? - 8 minutes 52 seconds . - Lomax confirms ? - Lomax confirms . Emergency division , yellow alert . Evacuate entire population to lower city . Seal off access to main dome . Look , you sure it 's not some sort of communication problem ? Jason , right now I 'm not sure of anything . I just don 't want to take any chances . Let 's see what else we can do . May I remind you that the council have great influence with the Master Computer ? Don 't fight it , John . Don 't make me ask for your resignation . ( BEEPING ) Yellow alert ? The whole city 's on yellow alert ! Go to red . Red alert . - Impact ? - Six minutes . MAN ON PA : This is not a drill . This is not a drill . All citizens proceed immediately to emergency underground shelters . Evacuate all surface dwellings . Kim ? Look at the weight distribution on that cargo ship . KIM : It 's almost empty . An empty cargo ship ? Doesn 't make sense . Excuse me . Master Computer Lomax , this is Jason Caball . ID confirmed . Go ahead , Jason . Okay , I need a bypass circuit to overload the Phobos 4 engines . - State priority classification . - Come on , Lomax . Cut the read tape . We have to destroy that ship . LOMAX : Priority request acknowledged . Two minutes to impact . LOMAX : Phobos 4 engine circuit display available . Okay , give me input control for a bypass circuit . Kim ? Kim , do you have this emergency under control ? We 're working on it , Father . Son , are you sure that none of Niki 's people are on board ? No life signs at all . Lomax confirms . MAN ON PA : Red alert . Red alert . Evacuate all surface dwellings immediately . Sectors one to six to shelter A. Sectors seven to ten to shelter ... Come on , Lomax . Stand by . MAN ON PA : This is not a drill . 70 seconds to impact . Procedure complete . Now you may activate . Sensors indicate negative response . Cargo ship did not destruct . Repeat , did not destruct . Impact 45 seconds . ( CHATTERING ) ( CHATTERING ) ( CLAMORING ) MAN ON PA : Crash site on monitor two . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) Master Computer Lomax , request dome repair units to begin work immediately on Sky Dome breach . LOMAX : Commencing restoration of protective environment enclosure . All residents to remain in emergency underground shelters . ( MURMURING ) Lomax , status on dome repair , please . Dome repair near completion . Repressurization will commence upon structural test . Send search teams to damaged sectors . All debris from cargo vessel should be sent here for examination . Understood . Sector 20 , totally destroyed . Area should be leveled . Danger of falling debris . Sector 18 , minor damage . Report assessment to engineering and repairs . All debris from cargo ship to be sent to lab six . Stand by , I have visual communication with Delta 3 . This is Omus , Robot Master on Delta 3 . I would like to talk to Dr. John Caball . Yes , Omus , this is Caball . Ah , Doctor , you remember me . Oh , yes , indeed . Now where 's Niki ? I want to talk to your superior . My superior ? Oh , yes , you mean the former governor of Delta 3 . I 'm afraid Niki and her followers have fled the citadel . I am in control now . Well , in that case , you know what just happened . One of your cargo ships crashed into New Washington . But of course . That was my plan . Omus ! This is Senator Smedley of the Moon Council . What is it you want ? I have made giant strides in technology , Senator . I can bring a new and more efficient way of life to the moon . Well , that 's certainly encouraging . Omus , you haven 't answered the question . You mean , what do I really want , Doctor ? Your respect , of course . And your support ... for my return to the moon colony . Return ? In what capacity ? As supreme commander of the moon , the Earth , and all the outposts in our solar system . Well , that of course is out of the question . If that is your reaction , Senator , then you will be hearing much more from me . Beginning immediately , there will be no further shipments of RADIC-Q-2 . This is madness ! You 're talking more like a blackmailer than a man of science . - John , don 't provoke him . - Now listen to me , Omus . We will never surrender New Washington to you or anyone else , even if it means war . John , you don 't have the authority to make that decision . Don 't talk of war , my dear Doctor . It would be disastrous , as tragic as the robot wars that devastated the Earth planet . Please ... consider my proposal . You mean your threat ? MAN ON RADIO : Lunar Control ? Lunar Control , this is Sector 20 . We found the pilot . It 's wedged in here . May take a while to get it out . - What do you mean " it " ? - A robot . Send it to robot repair as soon as possible . See you later , I 'm gonna go take a look at this suicide robot . Good . Well , Senator , we 've survived one attack . We may not be so lucky the second time . John , this man , Omus , you said he was a student of yours . Oh , yes , one of my brightest . In fact , I recommended his appointment to the Delta 3 unit . Well , then you should be able to tell us how to deal with him . Well , he 's a superb technician . But I could never quite decide what value he put on human life . Sir ? We have another problem . What now ? How do we treat radiation without a supply of RADIC-Q-2 ? We have emergency supplies . What we must do immediately is stop shipments to Earth . Even if it means people will die , Senator ? - Now , Jason . - Jason . My first responsibility is to the Moon Colony . Naturally , I 'm concerned about the Earth people . But we have a greater responsibility than just that to ourselves , Senator . We 've got to stop Omus . We 're gonna have to mobilize Starstreak . John , we don 't seem to be able to agree on anything . Hmm . Humpty Dumpty had a great fall . Well , let 's see if we can 't put you back together again . Lomax , what is your opinion ? How do we handle this emergency ? From data stored in computer backfills , it would seem that an act of aggression on our part would be imprudent . Lomax , you authorized the building of Starstreak . For exploration and defensive purposes only . Even so , the ship has never been fully tested . Her guidance system is not stabilized . The spectrum drive ... g-forces may prove too intense for the new alloy on the hull . And certainly , the distance to Delta 3 constitutes an inhibiting factor to such a journey . I suggest you extend the early warning detection range and carefully monitor all approaching cargo vessels . Senator , instruct the moon council that no aggressive acts are to be taken against Delta 3 . The council shall be so instructed . Well , Kim , you were right . There was something weird about that circuitry . The robot was programmed to blow himself up . This one will turn him into a pussycat . - ( BEEPING ) - Okay , get the tapes , quick . Tapes . - Here you go . - Okay . ( WHIRRING ) Okay . Let 's give him a jolt . Okay , I don 't know what they called you on Delta 3 , but I 'm gonna call you Sparks . - I am . I am . - You 're working ! I am ... I am self-adjusting . New circuits . I am self-adjusting . New circuits , new circuits , - Give him another jolt . - N-n-new circuits . Thank you . You are the dark lady of my sonnets , the lily of my valley . Uh , yeah . You can call me Kim . Looks like I made a poet out of you , friend . ( BEEPING ) ( KIM LAUGHS ) Son , Omus wants to control all of our lives , just the same way he controls his robots . He sees himself as some kind of benevolent dictator . He wants us to respect him , but at the same time fear him . Well , our society has no place for a dictator , not even a benevolent one . So what do we do ? Meet me in the space terminal , sector two . Starstreak . WOMAN ON PA : Danger . Extreme radiation hazard . This fuel chamber is a class A prohibited area . Okay , Sparks . This should complete your history course . Thank you , my dark lady of the sonnets . Now I have something to show you . I do have certain talents , you know . - ( WHIRRING ) - Watch this . ( WHIRRING ) How was that ? It 's terrific . What do you call it ? Bi-Locational Transference . BLT , for short . Oh . Whatever you say . ( MACHINERY WHIRRING ) WOMAN ON PA : Please be advised , sensors indicate fuel rods are overheating . Stability region has been surpassed and spectrum drive fuel pile is approaching meltdown point . Emergency cooling system must be reinforced with auxiliary supply of moderator . Sensors detect unauthorized presence on Starstreak . Determine whereabouts of all senior personnel . Kim ? That 's the pilot ? Yeah . Well , I 've sort of shored him up , reprogrammed him . He really does some incredible things . - Hello , Jason . - ( WHIRRING ) ( WHIRRING ) So I see . Listen , my father 's up to something involving Starstreak . - I may need your help . - Okay , what do you want me to do ? Just come with me . It won 't take too long . No . Sparks , you 've gotta stay here . Whither thou goest , I will go . - He 's sort of attached to me . - Well , bring him along , he might be useful . Okay . WOMAN ON PA : Fuel pile is cooling and reactions decelerating . Radiation reaching tolerable level . Cobalt drive reactors will achieve full power - in ten minutes . - ( BEEPING ) ( ALARM BLARING ) Danger . You have been exposed to extremely high radiation levels . Immediate treatment with RADIC-Q-2 imperative . Danger . You have been exposed to extremely high radiation levels . Immediate treatment with RADIC-Q-2 imperative . Danger . You have been exposed ... Have you found Dr. Caball ? - No , Senator . - Or his son , Jason ? - No . - Lomax ? They 're up to something . You must shut down all launch support systems immediately . I am in full control of the situation , Senator . Be patient . We will locate Dr. Caball . ( COMPUTERS BEEPING ) - Dr. Caball . - Kim , what are you doing here ? What 's this all about ? - I 'm taking Starstreak to Delta 3 . - But we have orders from Lomax . No , the Master Computer is wrong . Soft words now could destroy us . I 'm going to stop Omus , by myself if I have to . You won 't have to do it by yourself . Well , I was rather counting on your help , son . - Thanks . - I 'm going , too . I would like to help . Oh , hello . Who 's your shiny friend ? That 's Sparks . Oh , well . All right , the four of us then . But we have to launch immediately . No , we 're not ready . I gotta do a pre-flight check . No , I 'm afraid we don 't have ... ( RIPPLING TONE ) I 've located Dr. Caball . Visual scanners on Starstreak activated . Lomax has tracked us here . Son , we 've gotta go now or not at all . Yes , sir . - Countdown to ignition . - Now , Mr. Sparks ... Sequence for launch . DR. CABALL : ... this is a robot console ... similar to those on cargo ships , but much more sophisticated . Dr. Caball , I detect a need for medication . Yeah , well , you just keep that to yourself , Sparks , you understand ? Now , that 's an order . Stand by for liftoff in 30 ... - I 'm going to the jump seat . - 29 , 28 , 27 , 26 ... 16 , 15 , 14 , 13 , 12 , 11 ... SMEDLEY : They 're preparing for takeoff . Lomax , you 've got to stop them . 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 ... one , ignition . My God . Lomax ... what are their chances of reaching Delta 3 ? LOMAX : Percentages do not favor a successful journey . Disaster through malfunction predicted . Oh , God , no . Leveling out . KIM : ... 3277 . Course set for Delta 3 . Gylectron compass reading normal . Well , we 're on our way . Out there is the vastness of space , the unknown ... where all possibilities exist and man 's future is limited only by his imagination . And his vision of the stars . Father , Starstreak is everything you wanted . Very impressive . Correct pulse ratio , .004 . And how about you , Sparks ? What do you think ? It 's better than a Delta 3 cargo ship , Doctor . Delta 3 . Yeah , I wonder what happened to Niki . I hope she 's all right . ( GRUNTING ) I think we 're ready now , Niki . Listen , everybody ! We must get back into the citadel . We have to send a message out somehow . We should get through the tunnels all right , but the citadel itself is like a fortress . I think that there 's a way through the abandoned caverns into the power plant . Okay , come on . Let 's go . ( BEEPING ) Robot master . We 've completed the mining right through 2 and tunnel 4 . OMUS : Excellent . Request your immediate inspection . Everything is falling neatly into place . So far , no sign of Omus ' robots . I know , but you 'll have to move fast , Niki . When I get into the center , I 'm not gonna need much time . Tell them we can 't hold out much longer . - Good luck . - Thanks . ( SIREN APPROACHING ) ( LOW SIREN ) ( SIREN APPROACHING ) ( LOW SIREN ) ( COMPUTERS BEEPING ) Calling New Washington . Calling New Washington . This is Niki , the Governor of Delta 3 . Calling New Washington . This is the Delta 3 citadel , Niki calling ! We need some assistance . We need some assistance ! ( DISTANT SHOUTING ) ( OMUS MURMURING ) What 's this ? The channels are open to New Washington . WOMAN ON RADIO : This is New Washington . We hear you , Niki . Proceed with your message . ( LOCK BEEPING ) ( DOOR CHIMING ) Sound general alarm . ( ALARM BLARING ) ( ALARM CONTINUES ) ( SIREN BLARING ) ( NIKI GASPS ) I couldn 't get through . Damn . ( MAN SCREAMING ) ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) Come on , move it ! Let 's go ! Two more dead . What now ? I 'm not sure , Merrick . SPARKS : Doctor ? We have malfunctions of the gylectron compass , auto guidance systems , and the contra-flow units . We 're gonna have to set down . Well , we can 't go back to the moon . There 's only one place we can go to make repairs . Earth . Set coordinates for Vector 759 . There 's an old emergency tanker station there ... more or less abandoned now , but the guidance beacon ought to be in working order . Is there anyone living in the area ? Yeah , Charlie Montgomery , an old friend of mine . Sort of a guard , caretaker at the station . He 's due to retire back to the moon in a few years , but he 'll be able to help us . Coordinates set for Vector 759 , planet Earth . Any chance Lunar Control might have put out a report about us ? Possible , but we can trust Charlie . It 's gonna be strange being back on the Earth again . It 's been almost seven years . Seven years since the last of the great robot wars and the end of civilization as we had known it . It 's funny , I still think of myself as an Earth child . You were one of the lucky ones who escaped in time . Estimated arrival , 0600 hours . Good . I 'm gonna strap myself in . Approaching orbit altitude for Earth . Locking into orbit coordinates . Counter-gravitational control set for tanker beacon YR321 . Gravity equilibrium confirmed . Prepare for module separation . Module separation confirmed . Descent block to beacon YR321 . ( CHIRPING ) SPARKS : Shutdown completed . I 'll stay with you , Doctor , and help with your repairs . DR. CABALL : All right , Sparks . We 'll see if we can find Charlie Montgomery . Sure , give him my regards . Tell him he owes me a rematch at chess . - Okay . - Bye . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . Well , come on . Let 's take a look inside . Charlie ? - ( KNOCKING ) - Charlie ? Charlie Montgomery ? He must be around someplace . - How 's the equipment ? - Seems to be all right . I 'm gonna go check the tower . - Kim ? - Yeah ? - Mind how you go . - Okay . ( LOW GROWLING ) ( CHIRPING ) He must have some tools around someplace . Charlie ? Charlie , is that you ? ( CHIRPING ) ( GASPS ) Kim ? Kim ? Kim ? Kim ? - ( BEEPING ) - Kim ? Come in , please , Kim . Kim ? This is Jason calling Starstreak . Come in , please , Starstreak . Yes , what is it , Jason ? I found a dead body in the Earth station . What ? Charlie ? Afraid so , and that 's not all . I can 't seem to locate Kim . What do you mean ? I don 't know . She disappeared . - Disa ... - Oh , sir ? I 've got a vehicle here . I don 't know if I can get it running , though . Well , it 's rough terrain . You 'll need it . I 'm gonna send Sparks to help you . Okay , out . Now , Sparks , I want you to check radiation readings in the area . Yes , doctor . I want to know if Jason and Kim are in danger . - What about you , Doctor ? - Don 't you worry about me , Sparks . I 've never had a nursemaid before and I don 't intend to have one now . - Sorry , Doctor . - That 's all right . So , why don 't you just get on with it ? - Precisely what I had in mind . - ( WHIRRING ) ( WHIRRING ) What took you so long ? I 'm a little out of condition . Detectors locate Kim 's vital signs three kilometers west two quadrant . - Oh , yeah ? Is she alone ? - I can 't get an exact reading , but I 'm picking up a high radiation level in this area . Well , hop in , unless you wanna walk . Gotta stop doing that . ( ENGINE STARTS ) Hold on . ( CHIRPING ) ( ENGINE STALLS ) SPARKS : I detect a malfunction in the H2O containment system . Now what ? ( WHIRRING ) I 'm picking up Kim . All life functions seem intact , but she isn 't alone . Sensors also detect higher radiation levels ahead . ( CHIRPING ) ( CHIRPING ) SPARKS : Stop , Jason . Let me lead the way . Jason ! Jason ! Kim , get behind these cars ! - Jason , what 's wrong ? - Come on , Kim ! They 're not gonna hurt you ! They only want our help . What do you mean ? They 're children . JASON : Oh , my God . These children must be survivors of the great robot war . They must have been taken from the city just before it started . I don 't believe this . These kids must have been living out here for years . - You all right ? - Fine . - I was scared . - Yeah . I found a dead body in the Earth station . - It was Charlie . - The children told me . He was trying to help them . Jason , they 're sick . - Very sick . - Yeah . Radiation . ( WHIRRING , BEEPING ) Hey , don 't be afraid ! Sparks is our friend . SPARKS : I guess they still have a fear of robots after what they did to this world . These old weapons are leaking toxic substances . I suggest that children be treated with RADIC-Q-2 - as soon as possible . - ( WHIRRING ) I 'll be going back to the ship now . Jason , let 's get the kids out of here . - Let 's get back to the ship . - Come on , kids . We must inform Jason and Kim of your condition . No , they 've got enough to do without worrying about me . Anyway , I feel fine . No , I ... I 've managed this far and I 'll make it through to the end . JASON ON RADIO : This is Jason calling Starstreak . Come in , please , Starstreak . ( JASON MUTTERING ) ... got Kim . We 're on our way back to the ship . - SPARKS : Affirmative . - All right , out . Jason , would you just listen to me ? We 've gotta get back to the ship and back on our way to Delta 3 . These children need our help . Look , we can 't go back to the moon now . We can 't take these children with us . Look , if we can get to Delta 3 , we can pick up a supply of RADIC and be back here in a few days . That 's the best chance these kids have got and you know that . Yeah . Okay . Listen , kids , I know you 've had a tough time of it , but , please , just trust us . We won 't let you down , I promise . Okay , now , you kids just stay here , okay ? 'Cause we 're gonna come back and get you . ( WHISPERS ) Okay ? Okay ? All secure here . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Correct compass ratio , point 289 . Initiating docking maneuvers with mothership . Airlocks activated . Docking completed . JASON : Okay , set course , Kim . KIM : Course set for Delta 3 . Sequence for spectrum drive . Activate pulse generators for force shield . Pulse generator activated . Good . Initiating spectrum drive . SPARKS : Force shield functioning as programmed . What a strange experience . I don 't feel anything , and we 're approaching the speed of light . It 's just incredible . As a matter of fact , I feel very comfortable . Well , just be glad the force shield is fully operative because at these speeds a particle of dust could punch a hole in the side of the ship . I 'm beginning to feel a little less comfortable . So am I. Spectrum drive approaching control speed . I 'm gonna lock off now . Well , that couldn 't have been smoother . Any course corrections , Sparks ? Negative . No deviation from set flight path path path ... path path path path ... ( STUTTER CONTINUES ) - ( BEEPING ) - ( STUTTER FADES ) Okay , take it easy , Sparks . I 'll reprogram a better self-adjusting tape for you when we get back to the moon . - ( POPPING ) - Path path path path . Pattern . - Thank you . - Any time , Sparks . Well , the ship 's performing beautifully and I 'm beginning to feel just a little hungry . - You look a little tired . - No , no , Kim . I 'm not tired , I 'm just hungry . Yeah , well , I guess we could all use something to eat , huh ? - Sure . - Nothing for me , thanks . - Okay . - Perhaps later . I hope we have enough parts here . It 's our last hope to send a signal out into space . ( SIRENS APPROACHING ) ( LOW SIRENS ) - Take cover . - Come on . SPARKS : Kim , look at this . It 's on replay . JASON : It 's unbelievable . Yes , but I detect we are in some danger . I suggest a course alteration . - ( BEEPING ) - Now , what 's that ? Nothing serious . A minor malfunction in the spectrum drive auto-locks . I 'm gonna make a systems check . Not necessary . Everything 's under control . Okay . ( LOW SIRENS ) We 've got to get our transistor activated . If we send out a signal , Omus could pinpoint our location . Yes , well , we 'll just have to take that chance . By the way , Kim , I am looking forward to that new tape when we get back . I don 't know , Sparks . Sometimes the way you look at me , you give me the feeling that ... forget it . You are just a robot , aren 't you ? I 'm afraid so , but if there is any change , you 'll be the first to know . Yeah . - Hmm . Hi . - Hi . What 's that ? Oh , this is a very old book rescued from the Earth museum many years ago . - Must be very rare . - Oh , yes , it is . Yes . Most of them were destroyed , of course , some of them survived in memory baffles , but that ... that 's the real thing . What 's it about ? About ? Well , uh ... well , it 's about your people and ancient country called Greece . There were a bunch of philosophers , and they ... well , they ... they tried to understand the nature of the universe . Of course , they had only their own imagination , but what an imagination it was . Their vision , their ideas ... never cease to amaze me . Pay no attention . I 'm just a musty old professor lecturing to myself . No , you 're much more than that . Oh , you don 't have to humor me just ' cause I 'm an old man , you know . You 're the youngest man I know . Thank you . I 'm getting an intense gravitational pull on my readouts . KIM : Onboard computer reports proximity of an enormous magnetic field . What do you suggest , Sparks ? SPARKS : Counter with equal push . We 'll have to increase spectrum drive . - 5.002 . - 002 . - Locked in . - I 've got 004 , Jason . - No , 002 . - It 's 006 , now , and we 're still increasing . It just can 't be . We 're going out of control . Sparks , the switches are jammed . Give me the manual override . Negative . It won 't release . What do you mean , negative ? I can 't bring the speed down . Spectrum drive , we 're locked into it . JASON : Get back ! SPARKS : Closing rapidly on magnetic field . - We 're gonna break up . - Just hold on . ( MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS ) What the hell was that all about ? I believe we have been through time dilation . Kim . Kim ? Kim ? We rode it out . We 're still in one piece . SPARKS : Correct pulse , point 004 . Decrease thruster level . Drive control now reading normal . Switching off force field . Pulse generator deactivated . Jason , look . JASON : Delta 3 . Sparks , can we have an update on our coordinates ? We 're within the gravitational pull of Delta 3 , but our excessive speed has used up most of our nuclear power . How bad is it , Sparks ? We 'll be lucky just to limp into orbit , Doctor . Hold on . I have a monitor sighting . A Delta 3 cargo ship , the same as Phobos 4 . Robot pilot aboard . Full explosive load in the hold . DR. CABALL : No doubt on another collision course with New Washington . We don 't have the power now to catch up and destroy it . We could try and fire a missile . No , no . We haven 't got the maneuverability , Jason . Even if we could get close , our armament system hasn 't been tested . It means more destruction to New Washington and we just have to stand by and do nothing . I 'm picking up radio signals from Delta 3 . It 's a distress signal . Can you get a fix on that , Sparks ? I have the exact coordinates . All right , then . We 're going down . Prepare to disengage . - Okay . - Okay . Approaching orbit altitude for Delta 3 . Docking into orbit coordinates . Counter gravitational control set for signal beacon WA3581 . Gravity equilibrium confirmed . Prepare for module separation . Anti-gravitational controls activated . ( ALARM BLARING ) Well , well , what do we have here ? An expedition to our fair planet . Niki , look ! - Someone did hear ! - Come on ! It seems to me we ought to send out a little reception committee . ( CREATURE GROWLING ) Well , someone seems to know we 're here . ( CREATURE SNARLING ) It can 't be ! - Niki ! - John ! John Caball ! This is Niki . Kim Smedley . - My son Jason . - Hello . - This is Merrick , my deputy . - Hello , there . Welcome , friends , but we 'd better get away from here . ( LOW SIRENS ) It 's too late . Run . Discharge the robot electro force . ( SIRENS FADE ) I am Omus , emperor of Delta 3 . Welcome , my dear Dr. Caball . How marvelous to see you . I wanna talk to you , Omus , in person . Not just to a disembodied face , however impressive your holographic invention . Ah , doctor , I have many impressive things to show you in my citadel . All right , let 's get on with it . How do I get to the citadel ? It 's nearby . My guard robot will bring you . John , this could be dangerous . I 'm aware of that , Niki . Father , please , don 't try it alone . KIM : It 's too risky . If anyone can get to him , maybe I can . Jason . OMUS : Starstreak . Yes , perfect . No better way to return to New Washington than in Caball 's pride and joy . Well , I 'm not waiting any longer . - I 'm going to the citadel . - It 's not that easy . Show me the way , won 't you ? Do you really want me to ? - ( BEEPING ) - Sparks ? Go ahead . - How 's the power problem ? - Still working on it . Okay , keep monitoring us , and maintain sensors on Dr. Caball , all right ? Affirmative . - It 's this way . - Okay . ( LOW SIRENS ) Dr. Caball ... my old mentor . Considering our past relationship , Omus , I think you owe me some sort of explanation . Wait until you see what I 've accomplished . It 's astonishing . Come here , Doctor . Come . Now watch this . This is a RADIC-Q-2 factory . My empire ... with a network of underground tunnels . My mechanical warriors ... mining robots turned into obedient soldiers , with a new circuitry to handle more sophisticated input , and a capacity for independent thought . But totally loyal to you , no doubt . You spoke to us of a new technology , of peace , not war . Don 't you understand ? Once you accept me as ruler , there will be no acts of aggression , only peace . Under my rule , the people will want for nothing . Except freedom . Well , the moon colony will never accept a dictator . That 's one thing at least we 've learned from the history of the planet Earth . You insult me , Doctor . You are the one who inspired me , taught me to place science above all else . But never above humanity ! If I didn 't teach you that , then I failed you miserably . Omus , give up . Give up this insane plan of yours . But I am Omus , emperor of Delta 3 . - There ... - I don 't want to hear anymore ! I don 't think I even know you . You 're some sentimental old fool who doesn 't understand anything . I ... I am the world of the future . You 're back in some dark past ! People are no longer necessary . Even I , someday , may no longer be necessary . And you , Dr. Caball ... are certainly no longer necessary . Omus , you 're a sick man ! - Let me help you ! - No , Doctor ! Let me help you . Let me ... give you your last lesson on the power of science . Merrick , you stay here with the others . Kim , Jason , and I are going in . ( WHIRRING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SHOUTING ) ( HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING ) ( CABALL SCREAMING ) ( WHIRRING FADES ) Where 's your humanism now , Doctor ? - ( BEEPING ) - SPARKS : Dr. Caball ?

It will arrive at the citadel any moment now . What do you want with Starstreak ? It 'll become my new flagship . I 'm saying a last farewell to this place and to you and your friends . Except , of course , Sparks , who 's now working for me . You see , I am going to destroy Delta 3 . Why ? For what reason ? Because I am returning to the moon as spiritual successor to the late Dr. Caball , who , unfortunately , died heroically along with the rest of you in a tragic cosmic accident , and there will be no one to prove me wrong . ( LOW SIRENS ) When I activate that switch , it will set into motion the most incredible forces . What is normally an evolutionary process that could take a billion years , I can speed up into a matter of minutes . You 'll destroy the entire planet and our only source of RADIC-Q-2 ? My cargo ships are fully loaded . They will accompany me on my mission of peace . Starstreak has arrived . Omus ! ( PULSING TONE ) - I must go now . - Omus ! You murderer ! You 're as big a fool as your father . ( WHIRRING ) ( INAUDIBLE SCREAMING ) Come on , Niki . - No . - They 're dead . ( LOW SIRENS ) ( HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING ) I must reprogram Omus ' robots . ( LOW SIRENS ) - ( SIRENS FADE ) - ( SCRAMBLED BEEPING ) ( HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING CONTINUES ) ( SCRAMBLED BEEPING ) ( SCRAMBLED BEEPING CONTINUES ) Come on ! OMUS : Shut it off . Shut it off ! ( WHIRRING CONTINUES ) OMUS : Shut it off ! Turn it off ! ( WHIRRING FADES ) The activator can 't be stopped . - It 's too late . - How long we got ? About ten minutes . Jason ! We 've got to get back to Starstreak . - The planet 's gonna blow up . - Merrick and the others are dead . - ( RUMBLING ) - Come on . Let 's go . ( RUMBLING CONTINUES ) Jason , is everything all right ? Sparks , did you reprogram these robots ? SPARKS : Let 's just say we speak the same language . - Okay , where are you now ? - Aboard Starstreak , outside the citadel . Sparks , Delta 3 is gonna blow . Get to all the cargo ships . We got to salvage the supply of RADIC-Q-2 . Why are you doing this to me ? I am your creator ! Niki , secure yourself to the robot console . - Okay , let 's go . - Let 's go . Sparks ? Sparks , are you set ? All set , Jason . Suggest immediate launch . Okay , starting sequence now . Come on . ( GASPS ) JASON : Sparks , the first priority is to get this shipment of RADIC-Q-2 back to the Earth children . Course set for planet Earth . DR. CABALL : Out there is the vastness of space , the unknown , where all possibilities exist , and man 's future is limited only by his imagination and his vision of the stars . ( MUSIC PLAYING )

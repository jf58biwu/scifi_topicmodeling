I 've never been able to say things to you , Jess about how I feel . I guess I always counted on you understanding . When I was a kid , me and my father used to go for long walks . I remember staring down at his shoes . They were special shoes , brown , and he always kept them really shiny . He was tall and he used to take long strides . And there I 'd be right alongside him , just trying to keep up with him . I don 't think he ever knew how proud I felt of him or how good it felt just to be there alongside him . Even now when I think back on it , I still feel ... The thing is , Jess ... I couldn 't tell him about it then , but I can tell you about it now . I don 't want to wait 10 years to tell you how I feel about you right now . Do you know that I ... ? Hello . Get a load of that . Yeah , had a blow-out a while back . Raunchy , very raunchy .

Puss , puss , puss . Moo . Please ? Watch the tongue , loveable . I 've seen him lick his own eyebrow clean . You must have spent some coin . Like the sign says , speed 's just a question of money . How fast do you want to go ? Max , quick ! Get in ! What 's wrong ? Just take my word for it . Get in ! What about the tyre ? Please , Max ! What about the tyre , man ? Hey , fella ! What about the tyre ? Crazy people , man . Worid 's full of crazy people . That wagon , was it here ? Sure , sure . Couple with a kid . I was just fixing their tyre . They left a goddamn spare , not a bad one either . Ha . Who are they ? A couple ... passing through . Said they were heading north , maybe . Toot-toot . Want to drive the car ? Yeah ? No , you can 't anymore . Into the back . In you go . I can still see his face now . Looked as if he 'd just swallowed a brick . What a mean old lady you are . Huh , boss ? Enough from you , mate . Enough ! What 's the matter with you ? What you got there , mate ? Max ! Yep , that 's the way I see it too . Yeah , yeah . Yep , sure . It 's been nice talking to you . 'Bye . Thank you . Very good of you . If they 're not worried , I 'm not worried . What about that ? I figure it 's lost property . If no-one makes a claim to it , I say we can forget it . Sounds OK to me , Jess . Don 't know . If Ziggy says so , believe me , it 's OK . May 's expecting you up on the farm sometime tomorrow . You 'll get no trouble up there , just green grass and fat cows . How you doing ? Mmm , I 'm getting there . I reckon you ought to connect the doohickie to the gizmo . Come here , you . You touch me with those hands and I 'll rip you apart . You and who else ? No ! Look at them . Tell me . I want to know . No , no ! No ... Ah ! May told me about the little beach down by the trees . Mmm . You want to come ? I 'd love to , except I 've got to fix the fanbelt or we 'll never get out of here . OK , Tarzan . I 'll bring you back some bananas . Yeah . Oi ! Jessie .

How many have there been ? [ MEDICAL ALERT BEEPING ] Where ... ? [ ALERT INCREASES IN PITCH AND INTENSITY ] What 's happening ? [ EXPLOSION ] [ QUATERMASS ] It 's my guess . [ QUATERMASS ] That the stones were attempts ... [ QUATERMASS ] by our ancestors ... [ QUATERMASS ] to mark places that had become ... [ QUATERMASS ] ... terrible . [ MINISTER ] Where it came the first time ? [ QUATERMASS ] Five thousand years ago . [ QUATERMASS ] But its actual ... guidance beacons , to use our own term ... [ QUATERMASS ] will be far beneath . [ MINISTER ] And now it 's using them . [ QUATERMASS ] In every part of the world . [ QUATERMASS ] Eighty-seven incidents so far . [ QUATERMASS ] Gentlemen ... [ QUATERMASS ] the human race ... [ QUATERMASS ] is being harvested . Professor Quatermass , this " harvest " theory of yours . I don 't like it . I don 't buy it ! But surely , this terrible event ... " Terrible " , " terrifying " - those are his words . For countless thousands of deaths . " Deaths " ? What do you mean , David ? I believe that we 're in the presence of something that ... he doesn 't begin to understand . And you do ? Something ... momentous , I agree . A process so ... infinitely ... awesome . Yes . Yes , professor - I think I do . I 'm still young enough . I can just begin to grasp what the kids instinctively feel ... must be . The planet ? Yes ! [ RADIO ] " Er , Mission Control , Houston . " " Stand by to receive . " " Status report . " Shall we go ? " Indicates it is now in estimated ... " I 'd like you to be right . " Commencing direct radio transmission from shuttle rocket . " " Ten seconds from now . " " Radio alone will be used . " I 've got an old friend up there . Chuck Marshall . One of the best they ever had . Direct transmission . Isn 't that taking a risk ? That 's the idea , sir . To get noticed . - They 'll be within range now . - " Mission Commander to Mission Control . " " Ground elapsed time is six hours , forty minutes . " " Distance from Earth ... " " one hundred and ten thousand miles . " " We have , at this time , no sighting of any kind . " " Mother Bird . Mission Control to Mother Bird . " Of course - the mother bird draws attention away from the chicks . " Zone of this ... power web . " " We could be closing on it . " " We suggest you start signals now . " " Good a time as any . " " Roger . Will do . " Giorgi ? Yeah , he 's ready with his box of tricks . For the benefit of those that , er , might have missed it ... we are not talking to it in Russian . The language is mathematics . Clear sighting of Earth . Looks real small . Hard to believe anything could make a precise fix way out here . [ COMPUTER ALARM ] Hey , we got something . They 've found it . My God ! Wait . Wait . " Unless ... it could just be an indication of ... " Malfunction . Oh , my God , Chuck . " Hold it , Mother Bird . " " Our computer says you 've got a minor on board malfunction . " " Check it out , would you ? " [ COMPUTER ALARM ] [ SIGHING ] Sorry , Mission Control . Blame Giorgi . He 's not , er , overly familiar with American-type control . I don 't know , though . We 're getting a kind of a generalised ... I don 't know what the hell we 're getting ! Hey , Giorgi - did you see that ? That was outside . " It 's incredible ! " " it 's-it 's like a gigantic laser beam ... only it pulsates ! " " it could be ten miles away ... or-or a hundred ! " " Pointing straight towards Earth ! " " And in the other direction - right away out ! " " I 'll try and get a camera on it . " There won 't be time . " It 's gone . " Twenty seconds . I wonder where ... ? We 're into malfunction ! Total malfunction ! All systems ... [ SCREAMING ] " Mother Bird , are you receiving me ? " " Mother Bird , are you able to receive me ? " " Mother Bird , this is Mission Control . " " Can you read us ? " " Mother Bird , do you read u ... " I don 't think ... it even knew they were there . [ AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE ] [ GUNFIRE AND SCREAMING ] Hang on ! Oi ! [ GUNFIRE BECOMES SPORADIC ] [ CHANTING ] Leh . Leh . Leh . Hold it ! Look at that ! There 's Reds and Blues marching together !

" [ RHYME FADES IN DISTANCE ] - The Stadium . - What ? You 've got to stop it . Ah , no - no action . But you must have heard . They 're gathering in tens of thousands . God knows how they 're getting there ... They 've always done it ! It 's an institution . But not like this ! The game 's ceased to matter much . I agree . In fact it 's minimal . Oh , let 's face it - the whole thing 's been encouraged as an outlet . A bit of harmless bloodletting . We could accept a few hundred casualties . Oh , that 's us . That 's what we 've come to ! That place can hold a hundred thousand ! Do you really suggest Wembley Stadium is an ancient site ? The " Sacred Turf " , they call it . - I wonder what 's underneath ? - [ SNIGGERING ] Do something , man . Stop them ! [ CROWD ROARING ] [ EXCITED SHOUTING ] [ CAR HORN BEEPING ] [ AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE ] Listen . [ MORE GUNSHOTS ] Shots . I doubt if he 'll do anything . No - what they 're chanting . It 's that old rhyme . The nursery rhyme . " H uffity Puffity ... " " Ringst0ne Round . " Get on with it , man . Do you think he needs our help ? [ PISTOL SHOTS ] [ GLASS SMASHING ] [ GUNFIRE AND CROWD NOISES ] Where do I go now ? ! This way ! This way ! [ WAGON LAMP SMASHING AGAINST ENTRANCE ] They 're still there . Cut ' em off ! We 're trapped ! [ SCREAMING ] [ GROANING ] Annie ! [ AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE ] [ UNEARTHLY HIGH-PITCHED NOISE ] [ GHOSTLY CHILDREN TALKING ] " What are you doing , Daddy ? " [ FOOTSTEPS ECHOING , WIND KEENING ] [ PLAINTIVE , DISCORDANT MUSIC ] [ WIND KEENING ] Hey - you ! What do you think you 're doing ? ! Come here ! Loofing , eh ? You know the penalty for that ? No - no ! Wait , please ! You 'd better see my papers . Who 'd you steal them from ? How was I to know ? I want to see the Stadium . Well , sir - you 're not ... it 's been affected , sir - we 're not supposed ... It 's only the dust . You 've struck this before ? Yes . How many were there ? Who ? Here ? Do they know ? Maybe seventy thousand . Who can tell ? They shouldn 't have been here ! Came for trouble . Ripping each other to pieces . Last night it was guns . We were put on standby and I thought " here we go " . And ... then ... It 's not only the dust . You do ... you do find ... other kinds ... other ... [ RETCHING ] Yes , you do . Here comes the sun . Oh ... I could do with that . Worst night I 've ever had . The sun ? ! [ DISCORDANT MUSIC ] The sun - it 's ... turned ... It 's like vomit . [ QUATERMASS ] This is Pavel Grigoritch Gurov ... [ QUATERMASS ] of the Soviet Academy of Sciences . [ QUATERMASS ] Mr Gurov has a statement to make . In the matter of this special threat , er ... co-operation between Soviet Union and US of America ... has now ceased . Er , since failure of rocket mission ... And collapse of communications . Er , please . What is this force which attacks us ? Mass destruction of personnel in Soviet Union ... and also in associated democratic republics of Eastern Europe ... as well as other places ... indicates that it is not sensible . Not ... sentient . Ah . Academician Gurov now thinks as I do . That we 're facing not an intelligence ... but a machine ... of unbelievable sophistication ... but still a machine . Da . Da . But , Professor ... a machine must have a maker ? Of course . But the intelligence that made this ... is quite beyond our reach ... and our understanding . It 's probably thousands of light years away . This is , um ... call it a probe they 've sent . Just as we 've sent probes to other planets ... to get soil samples . This thing ... must be programmed ... to sense living human protein ... and to take it . It is not efficient . It wastes . Today I fly through a sky that has gone ... gone sick ! Particles in the atmosphere . Particles of ... personnel that ... [ SOBBING ] My ... son . He was Major , Soviet Forces - Far Eastern Sector ... with duties to prevent these gatherings , but ... they run with the rest . Even Red Army , they are taken . Mr Gurov has come here at great personal risk . Because now I agree with him . In Moskva , they say it alive . Kolpakov say ... he is a fool , but he say and they believe it - alive . It 's Marshal Kolpakov . An extreme hawk . They prepare now to send rockets - many of them . Kolpakov wish to kill it . He cannot . It will not kill . He 's got no target . How can he ? Only ... ... if he knew in advance ... where that beam was going to strike . If he could hit it ... during the ... twenty seconds that ... The Earth is losing of its young . It can die . Time . We haven 't any , have we ? None at all . I will work with him . I 'll need facilities . But there won 't be enough of those , either ... so I want people . Well , tell us who you want . Well , they 'll have to have their wits about them and , er ... like us , they must be old . Old ? Yes . The older the better . [ TELEPRINTER NOISE ] When computer beat me , I go back to this . All my life I use it - since child . Draws picture in mind - you can see problem . So now we must keep problem clear in mind . How this thing attacks . It attacks on place marked from ancient time ... but only when also a big number of crowd is there , da ? - Oh , not again ! - Oh , please ? Well ... if it helps . Spasiba . So , it must detect crowd ... like heat-seeking missile . Body heat ? Well , I thought ... Oh , forgive that I think of missiles - I work on missiles ... but what about the sound of personnel ? The noise ? Do we eliminate that ? No . We use it . So , I am right . We use everything that 's a possible factor . But I 'm sure all the aggression , the yelling ... and the dancing - it 's just to excite . To stir up the glandular secretions . The unique smell of the human species . You 've heard about Bovington Camp ? Yes . My God . And Naples ... and Palm Springs . [ OSCILLOSCOPE TWEETING ] [ YAWNING ] I never sleep . I haven 't slept for ... oh , let me see ... [ LAUGHING ] quite a number of years . [ CHANTING IN DISTANCE ] Leh . Leh . Leh . Listen to them . That sky . Do you still say harvest ? Yes . Well , perhaps we mistake . What sort of harvest is thrown away so . Something was taken . It must be . But what ? Some ... trace . The very scent that betrays them . Perhaps a flavour . [ EXCLAIMS IN RUSSIAN ] To enrich the lifestyle of ... inconceivable beings . Not even that . Just amuse them . [ ELECTRONIC HUMMING ] My God , I can 't remember which of these ... There - the digital filter ! Who is that ? Dyevushka - girl ? My granddaughter . Child of my daughter . Gone ? I think so . Oh , she was like you . Help ! [ DRAMATIC MUSIC ] He 's collapsed . - It was too much for him ! - Jack ! Help him ? Help him ! Oh , come on - hurry ! Well , you see - I 've been worried about him all day . Frances - calm , now . This is the sort of setback ... Setback ? ! But we did it ! That 's benzaldehyde . The electric image of a smell . Now we can begin ! This place was favoured ! It did come here ! [ CHANTING ] Leh . Leh . Leh . Kickalong - look ! Halt ! This your place ? Yeah . All gone but you ? Seen this before , haven 't we ? Yes . Always one or two left crying . Yes . It touched here , all right . All touched with the fingers of the lightning ! [ MUTTERING ] Lightning . What you been doing ? What you been up to ? You been trying to fix ... Don 't ! Science Man - this is no good for anything . I 've got to use it ! I 've got to get through ! Get through ? Communicate . Transmit some kind of ... " Communicate " ? - He 's interfering . - Don 't let ' im ! We 've got to find a way to make ourselves understood . To show that we 're capable of understanding . Bust it ! No ! No ! [ FRANTIC CHANTING ] Leh . Leh . Leh . SOON ! [ CHANTING ] Soon ! Soon ! Soon ! Evacuation ? Where ? We 're clearing the area , sir . Why ? Now , just be still . No , no . No . No , I don 't need that . Just tell me . What 's it for ? - Well , sir , because ... - Where is he ? Where 's Quatermass ? Professor Quatermass himself gave orders that you should ... Quatermass ! Is it okay to start everything now ? Yes , yes . Put them up . Bernard ? [ COUGHING ] You all right ? What 's going on ? Listen ... all this talk of ... evacuation ? They 're clearing the area . Joe , I 'm sorry . But , I mean , they wanted to get me out . I ... had to take it for granted . I 've got to use this place . It 's the only possible . But it 's already been hit . That 's what I mean . I just can 't seem to ... It means there 's a marker . Right here . Somewhere underneath . A marker beacon ... left fifty centuries ago . That 's why it was hit . Why I can use it . Use your antennae . So you ARE going to try and signal ? I 'm setting a trap for it . What ? Look , Bernard . Just say it ! Joe ... if you 're after a wild beast ... you don 't go chasing it around the landscape . You bring it to you . You bait a trap for it . A beast ? A machine beast . A man-eater . I 'm going to put out the analogue ... of a human presence . The sound of them . The smell of them . Their blood . Their secretions . Hormones . Pheromones . Human young ... about a million of them . How 's that for bait ? And the poison ? There 'll be poison [ CAR BEEPING ] Cup of tea , sir ' ? Da . If only it functions as it should . Perhaps that 's the hold-up ? Mmm . This focus mechanism . Very ingenious . But our people have certain criticisms . Where the hell is it ? Quatermass - this is not for you to do ! You can trust me . But I-I did not intend to ... I 'll manage . Besides ... I 've got some help . [ HELICOPTER ENGINE , MOVING CLOSER ] Bernard ? Look ! A focal bomb . Thirty-five kilotons of nuclear blast ... just to sting it . Send a shock back across the galaxy . [ ELECTRICAL HUMMING ] [ HUMMING INCREASES ] Just thump it . Like that . Simplest arrangement we could rig up . [ ELECTRICAL HUMMING STOPS ] Foolproof . Now - I 'll arm it . Blast area is focused to a minimum . Yes . Which will be approximately , um ... I know what I 'm doing . I wish to check . Professor , I trust there 's no question of this man 's taking charge ? None . Hmph ! There should be ! It should not be for him and him to do . He 's going with you . Sorry . That 's it . [ ELECTRONIC BEEPING ] Quatermass ? Yes ? Right , General . Thank you . [ OWL HOOTING ] Time . Now , the build up . Full hour ? Well , one million kids mustn 't arrive too quickly . Think it matters ? It might . We are giving a performance . [ ELECTRIC HUMMING ] [ HUMMING BUILDS IN INTENSITY ] Trap 's set . Our Planet People are ... they 're starting to arrive . Monitor . [ ELECTRONIC CROWD NOISE ] Well ... just one thing to do . Going to have that cup of tea . [ OSCILLATING TONE ] The hut down there . I can just make it out . Not much of a home . Yes it was . We were always going to go to the seaside . Some day - when things got better , we said . I can make them exist , do you know that ? Oh , not by magic or faith ... by thinking . I can carry Debbie down to the water 's edge ... where she never went . She dips her toes in . It 's not so cold - not too cold . She 's pleased . Because she 's been afraid of it and now she isn 't . And she sees the little bits of weed drifting about ... the colours and the shine . Then Clare comes with Sarah by the hand - walking in the waves . I can touch them . Oh , I know what evil is . That 's evil . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC ] Suppose it can 't ? Like lightning not striking twice . This lightning 's programmed . If only I 've guessed the program . They 're all here , now . A million of them . Waiting for you . A million kids . [ ELECTRONIC CROWD NOISE ] You came yesterday . Five thousand years ago . Tasted them . Found them good . And came again today . So come now . Come ! There 's somebody ! [ CHANTING ] Leh . Leh . Leh . There are more of them ! Get away ! Get back ! GET AWAY ! Get away from here ! Get away ! You 'll all die ! [ ELECTRONIC ALARM ] That 's a bomb ! [ AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE ] [ ELECTRONIC CROWD NOISE ROARING ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC ] [ LABOURED BREATHING ] He ... [ SINISTER MUSIC ] [ PANTING ] [ HOPEFUL MUSIC ] [ DETONATION ] [ GUROV ] The message was taken . It has not come again . We pray it will never come again .

 Hey up ! Over here ! Coming . CHARLES : Hello , there . Travellers , eh ? - Yes , from the West Country . - Healthy , are you ? Yes . Are you ? Nothing a good fill of shag wouldn 't cure . Uh , we 're looking for a man called Preston . Greg Preston . We heard he 'd come this way . He 's probably heading for the coast . Little fella , is he ? Baldy ? Fifty years old ? No , he 's in his 30s , six feet tall , and fair . Nah , not this fella . Bald , on the short side . - Traders ? - Well , let 's say missionaries . In that case , you should have some fun with them mill folks . - Eh , Larry ? - Yeah . - What mill folk ? - See for yourself . Over there . CHARLES : Hey , would you believe , mechanisation ! One thing , you 'll find them quite " disarming " . ( LAUGHING ) Welcome in peace . Your guns , please . - Sorry ? - No guns here . Hence " disarming " . I 'll take the gun . - I forgot that , thanks . - All right . These are a little heavier . - Welcome in peace . - CHARLES : Thanks . We have this rule about guns . And yours . They 'll be locked safely away till you 're ready to leave . CHARLES : Okay . Welcome in peace . - Jim says you 're looking for someone . - That 's right . - Name of Heston ? - Preston . He 's a tall , fair chap . Not been through here . - Pity . - You staying long ? - Well , that depends ... - Just overnight . Fair enough , then . Bunk down in the barn . Come on , I 'll show you the way . Here we are , then . No thanks , Hubert . There is a proposal I 'd like to discuss with your leader sometime . - Out of luck , mate . - Sorry ? We don 't reckon seniority and that no more here . ( STAMMERS ) Uh , well , your committee , the whole community , however you make decisions . - Hello . - Hello , I 'm Charles Vaughan . This is Jenny Richards and Hubert Goss . I 'm Frank Garner . Welcome to you all . You 're best off inside , Frank , raw day like this . And so are these good people . Henry lacks finesse as a host . Why not come inside the house for a little comfort ? Oh , this will do fine . - No , no , no . - They 're off first thing in the morning . Well , they need a good night 's rest . - What about a hot bath ? - Thank you . FRANK : Come on . - Hey up . What about the horses ? - The lad 'll sort ' em . Not while I 'm hale , he won 't . Little nags like these ? Welcome in peace . Over here and on the right . In there . It 's cosier than the barn . - It 's most hospitable . - But there 's a price on it . Oh ? You see , for some time now I 've been very anxious ... Oh , Henry , is the ... Is the young lady comfortable ? - Aye . - Most anxious to ... Uh , to ... to show you the mill . - Fine . - It 's quite an achievement . - Yes , tremendous . - Not mine , I hasten to add . Henry had it fixed up and running long before I got here . The first private enterprise venture to get started up after the Death . Still the thirsty little capitalist , I were in them days . But not now ? We 're squaring up on our priorities now . - Eh , Frank ? - Well , no thanks to me . Like heck . And still some way to go . Oh , rubbish , Henry . Everything 's fine here now . Anyway , tomorrow we 'll give you the full initiation . Milling , sail setting , maintenance , the lot . Well , that 's very kind . Uh , I 'd like to see it tonight if I may ? Oh , it 's too late tonight , isn 't it , Henry ? The light 's gone . And anyway , it 's swarming with rats after dusk , scavenging around for the spill from the milling . We 'll show it all to you tomorrow . Yes , well , as it happens , we 've got another job on for the morning . Little novelty we 're hoping to interest you gentlemen in .

There 's a bed for you in the house , you know . If it 's all the same to you I was gonna shake down here , keep an eye on the horses . That 's against the rules . - Oh , have you thought for why ? - Oh , for peace and love , brother Hubert . ( GRUNTS ) Peaceable they may seem to you , squire , but ... - But what ? - Well , for one , where 's their stock ? They don 't run no cattle , sheep , nor pigs up here , you know . Just a bunch of Satan 's goats . And for two , they ' re a right shifty lot - given to peeping and prying . - Oh , for heaven 's sake , Hubert . Oh , you can scoff . But you wait till you hear their Chinese ideas . - Chinese ? - And for three , they got a darkie here , black as an old boot . - JENNY : Charles ! - In here , Jenny . - Apparently , the meal 's ready . - Oh , not before time . I could just get me choppers around a good chump chop . - Doesn 't smell much like chops . - Don 't you recognise it ? - It 's vaguely familiar . - It 's curry , surely . You 're right . I 'd quite forgotten . ( CHUCKLES ) Come on . Wog food ? ( CHATTERING ) - Second lot coming up in a minute . - MAN : All right , darling . Yes , I know . But I 've got to serve the guests first . Okay . - Look here , food 's improving , Blossom . - Oh , thanks . ( MAN LAUGHING ) Hello , Hubert . Not hungry ? ( GROANS ) Well , not everybody takes to our grub straight off . Windy nosh for windmill people , eh ? Who 's this chap Preston you 're after ? He 's my husband . - He 's just been to Norway on a trip . - Why Norway ? Hydroelectric power in near limitless supplies . Potential for re-establishing our light industry . Possibly even get a refinery going again , with oil piped in from the North Sea . Industrial Revolution all over , eh ? - It 's hardly that . - Norwegians have very big problems , farming 's hard there . They need food . Also technicians . - Which you 're planning to organise ? - Exactly . Once we 've linked up with Greg . Sounds like quite a big enterprise . It 's crucial . If that 's how you rate your priorities . Try some of this curd cheese , Hubert . It 's great with a chapati . I 'll tell you straight , woman . I 'm a man likes to get his choppers into a nice bit of beef . Ah , well , we 've found that meat in the diet is bad for the temperament . It makes for aggression . Well , I manage to be peaceable enough on it myself , don 't I , Jenny ? - Stop being fussy . - Who , me ? Well , Rutna believes that cattle should only be for milk and for ploughing . Eaten only by low-caste peoples . - Low what ? - Rutna means the untouchables , friend . Your priorities here are rather different , are they ? Maybe we 're all of us stood at ... like a crossroads . We must decide which way we should take . Is the choice ever so clear-cut ? Well , it 's up to us . You see , us lot here , Mr Vaughan , we 've figured it out like a sort of a reincarnation . Sorry ? Mankind died and has to be born again . - Born again to a new life . - And a better life . Look , after the Death we found this place , got it going , no trouble . Only snag , we was a right bunch of cavemen , at each other 's throats at the slightest thing , moping , griping , or else , downright broody . It 's only a morale problem , you 're not alone in that . - Until our Frank pitches up . - Just in time , you know ? Took us on , see . Sorted us out . - How , exactly ? - Got us talking , pulling together . Oh , I only got a sort of therapy thing going . ( SITAR MUSIC PLAYING ) The real credit 's due to Rutna . You reckon us a right comedy turn , don 't you ? - Whatever you believe , it 's up to you . - And our Rutna . - What 's it mean , exactly ? - What ? - The , um , blob . - Ah . - Hindu prayer mark . - Oh . - Shows I 've done me daily meditation . - About what ? Peace and love ? It 's more a mood , really . Frame of mind , like . Serenity , tranquillity , all that . - And Rutna taught you that ? - Sure . Plus the right nosh to help it along . And the fact that everything 's due to fate , the Death plague included . - You mean ... - Predestined , wasn 't it ? - Hence the way we try to live here . - Sorry ? See , it 's just got to be our destiny , right ? You got all this from her ? - Seems shy ? - Yeah . Do you wonder ? She comes here from the Punjab at the age of 16 to marry some bloke she 'd never even set eyes on and then bang , the Death . You 'd be shy . - Well , it 's more as though ... - What ? Serenity , you say . But to me she seems almost hostile . - Frightened , that 's all . - Oh . - Of strangers . - Of us ? I remember the hell of it all at first . The fear and privation . Folks weren 't too Christian then . Particularly towards Asian women . One lot of apes actually stoned her , would you believe . They reckoned the plague started out east and our Rutna was somehow to blame . Anyway , Frank brought her here to us . And you know how she sees him now ? As Masterji , as she calls him . - As a guru . - A holy man ? Well , she worked it out from his birthdate or something . She reckons that Frank is the reincarnation of the one and only Maharashtraji . How 's that for devotion , then ? I was with a personnel selection firm , what they used to call a headhunter . Oh , I see . Hence your being clued up on psychology , the group therapy . Well , it was pretty ineffective till we found Rutna . How come ? Well , she has her serenity , and a more realistic sense of values . What , because she sees everything as what , predestined ? Look , mate , her people , they 've had generations of plague and famine and that and learned to live with it , survive regardless . Us , we 're just beginners . - Good night . Sleep well . - Good night . Thanks . - Tranquillity , remember . - I 'll try . Please . What is it ? I must beg to you . - For us all . - Beg ? You must leave here most soon . We plan to leave first thing in the morning , just as soon as Charles has got this telephone link fixed up . ( SPEAKING PUNJABI ) Why the rush ? The Mr Charles , he believes he sees the way , - sees how people must live . - Oh , yeah , man of vision . - Your guruna ? - No . Mine 's taller , with a blond halo . The Masterji , he will wish to tell him much . - Tell Charles ? - Show him a dream , like water above the desert . He must not listen . Some hope . Must close his ears , must only leave here . All right . But why ? There is ... - danger . - What ? I told you , we plan to leave first thing in the morning . So ... If he will let you . Who ? Why ? ( LAUGHING ) But you can 't just go around tilting at power stations . Oh . Oh , it 's not all that quixotic . Well , this enterprise of yours , you must broaden it , establish some new social organisation . - Some alternative society . - Well , fine , fine . But ... what form ? I mean , peace and love , fatalism and pre-destiny ? All right , so it works for you here . Yes , it does . And I 'm very pleased for you . But for us , for me , for the man in the street , I 'm afraid it 's just too way out . Time you were in your pit . Reckoning on an early start in the morning , aren 't you ? Aye . You can 't just leave it there , Henry , convince him . No , no , no , Henry 's right . I 've got to stay alert for the wilds . - Good night . - Have a good sleep . Priorities , right ? - Good night . - Good night . And good riddance . He 's right , Henry . Calling us hippies ? No , but he 's right for me . You must see that . A mad capitalist tearaway ? ( CHUCKLING ) You 're off your rocker , old friend . ( BELCHING ) ( HORSE NEIGHING ) Oi ! What are you doing prying around ? - Please , I come to warn you . - Huh , what about ? Out with it . - The horses . - What about them ? - They are sick . - Hmm ? They eat bad hay . - Better go and fetch the guvnor . - Masterji ? No , no , Master Vaughan . - What is it , Hubert ? - Quivers . Your nag 's the worst . - Are they fevered ? - Oh , we 're stuck here now . Well ... How ? What happened ? This , most like . CHARLES : Yew sprigs . Happened I scotched it before they got too much down inside them . - Yeah , but they don 't look at all well . - So what 's the score now ? Well , if I get hold of some linseed oil , they 'll be right as rain by tomorrow . It could have been worse . They could have chose to kill them . - Chosen ? What do you mean ? - Well , it was by no accident . They 've been poisoned ? Well , none of the other nags in there is struck , only ours . - But why ? - I told you , didn 't I ? Wog ideas . - Aye , she did say something last night . - Who ? Uh , Rutna , the Indian woman . But it doesn 't prove anything . Prove what , Jenny ? I 'm sorry about all this . Rutna asked me to give you that . Linseed . Quite bright for a darkie , isn 't she ? It must have been a bad truss of hay or something . Really ? Well , anyway , one or two days ' delay will give us more chance to talk . - If they 'll let you . - I beg your pardon ? Your shadow . Right , let 's get this telephone hook-up sorted out and you can be on your way . - You 're joking . - What do you mean ? No horses . You tell him , Frank . HENRY : Chaperones ? - I don 't know what you 're on about . - CHARLES : No ? Perhaps " guards " would be a better word . Look , friend , just watch it . Frank Garner 's like fresh air and sunlight to us . And you don 't want him polluted , is that it ? What ? Why should he want to poison our horses ? - You 're bonkers . - Am I ? He 's desperate to keep us at the mill . Now , why ? Might be he fancies a change of company . - It 's more than that . - You reckon ? He doesn 't buy it , you know . Buy what ? All your fatalism and pre-destiny stuff ? Like you . He reckons it 's a load of cobblers . So ? Come on , let 's get on with this . - Amazing . - Please ? A community of a dozen people , all British , and within a year you 've converted them to vegetarians , worshipping Vishnu , or Brahma , or whoever . But they have not taken to our gods , not a one . You must see , Jenny , Hinduism , it is not like your Christianity . More , it is a way of life than a , how you call , a religion . Oh . Also , it was not with me to convert them . This was totally 100 % the wish of the Masterji . But how ? Always when we gather in the evening , he 's asking questions , asking and leading a little here , a little there , and so we have come to it together . I see . Right , now clip the red one onto that one . And now the black one on the one higher up . Careful ! Look , mate , Tarzan on a building site , wasn 't I ? What 's the time ? Just on 4 : 00 . All right , come on down , we 'll give it a try . ( CLUCKING ) - Hello ? - Nothing ? - Don 't say all that work for nowt . - Hello ? - Hello , Pet ? - Charlie . Where are you ? I 'll tell you in a minute . Say hello to Henry here , he needs convincing . Hello ? HUBERT : Psst ! - Hey . - What is it ? - Do us a favour , girl . - What ? Quick kitchen job . Oh , Hubert , you wretched old man . A lead on Greg . PET : Forget Greg . Come back here where you 're wanted , where you 're more use . More what ? Uh , listen ... We met someone who had news of Greg and said he was going to the coast , heading for the Norfolk coast . So what ? CHARLES : Look , how are you all there ? Have you settled in ? We 've got five more here from Whitecross . Agnes is on the mend and she 'll be coming here as soon as she 's fit to travel . What ? Pet , I 'm sorry , I can 't hear you . Tell Jenny that the kids are all right . Goodbye , Pet . Norfolk coast . Well , it 's up to maximum range , in the absence of a good , punchy battery . So we 'll have to wait for the GPO connection , then ? ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm afraid so . Come on , then . I 'll show you something that really does work . The mill ? - CHARLES : What 's this ? - Striking chain . Pull it and see . It 's like putting her in gear . It closes the vents so the wind can get to work . The mill wouldn 't go without it . Start her turning . Right . Now , come and see her roll . CHARLES : It 's marvellous . All this massive gearing and yet it 's so gentle . And , all automatic . The fan-tail out there keeps the sails square on to the wind . There 's a governor to open the sail vents up a bit if she gets going too fast . All we do is set the stones for the required fineness of flour , fill the hopper and leave her to it . What about the bearings ? Made of bronze . Main one 's right there . Now , this is the hoist to lift the grain sacks up to the floor below us . The stone floor . Come and see . We found their records . Been 160 years of milling here . All but non-stop . Welcome in peace . Are you well ? Aye , as well as may be , after starting out at 4 : 00 this morning . Mike ! Customer . Settle them into the barn , will you ? Yeah , won 't be a minute . The grain creeps down from the middle of the top grinding stone there . - Is this the governor ? - Aye . Wind gets up too high , them two weights lift out with the centrifugal force , operating that linkage up to the sails , which opens up the shutter vent a bit to slow her down . It 's ingenious . No credit to us . Welcome in peace . Your guns , please . You being funny , my lad ? I 'm sorry , sir , no guns . It 's a rule here . Away you go , son . Sorry , friend , but all mill customers have to surrender their weapons . - Oh , aye ? - Just while they 're here . - Shove off . - It 's our non-violence rule . Aye . And you know what you can do about that , don 't you ? Please . Listen , monkey , do you think I 'm soft in the head or something ? - Look , there 's no danger . - ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , no ? This is a hard wee world we live in , right ? If you think I 'm going to be stupid enough to hand over my gun to you shower of weirdo hippies , you 've got another think coming . - Now , shove off ! - Mike ! ( SIREN DRONING ) Come on . Something 's up ! What the hell 's going on ? They 're taking the chain . Into the house . - Where 's Jenny ? - She 's gone on ahead . - We 'll take care of that . - Right . - Go see what Jim 's up to . - Here . Hey ! Leave that chain there ! Come on . Fix that door ! ( SIREN STOPS ) Please . I beg you . Not the guns . Here , brother . You plays your little games . Fine ! Different set of rules for the rest of us . - Listen , unless you give us a chance ... - A chance ? This here 's the only chance-getter now . Yeah ! So what do we do now ? You have a rule , you live by it . Christ , Gandhi . We 're not the first , you know . You 're joking . Men like that , they live by the gun . You can 't reason with them . I mean , what if he goes mad and really kills someone ? He won 't , mate . - Are you so damn sure ? - Never lost anyone yet . Where 's Hubert ? Uh , I fear he 's attending to the demands of nature . Not that curry still ? In a manner of speaking . Does this happen often ? - Not so much lately . - Hey ! You monkeys in there . ( GUN FIRING ) You 'd best get out here and fast . I 'm warning yous . Don 't think yous can play around with me . I 'll give yous 10 seconds to get out here and bring that chain with you . Or I 'll put a torch to your precious mill . - Burn it ? - Just bluff . You 'd better be sure . Do you hear me in there ? If not , well ... That mill 's unique . So is our community , Mr Vaughan . Our beliefs . One ... two ... three ... I mean it , monkeys ! ( GUNSHOT ) ... five ... - six ... - MAN : Hey , Mac ! - Aye , what is it ? - Here . - Why don 't we settle for this lot , eh ? - Oh-ho . Aye , why not ? You leave that flour where it is ! Leave it ! Shut your mouth , old man . Beliefs ! You 're just opting out . What ? Someone could get killed any minute . And why ? Because of this . Because you 're abdicating authority . Charles , look , there 's Hubert . Hey . In there . - Right , that 's it . - Hang on . To hell with peace . Drop it , eejit . You heard . ( EXCLAIMS ) What the ... That 's enough ! Oi ! ( GUN COCKING ) Peace and non-violence , eh ? - You started it . - MAN : And you can finish it . Hand it over or he gets it . No one gets anything . Just hand it over , mate . ( GUNSHOT ) MAN : Get back ! That 's a lot of fuss and noise over a sack of flour . You okay ? Thanks to you , yes . You wouldn 't have got clobbered eh , dad ? Not if you 'd stuck by rules . ( GROANING ) Aw , did he get a bump , then ? Well , show Blossom . She knows how to make it better . Get the mill started again . Right . We 'll give you a hand with the chain . Frank 's inside . I believe he has summat to ask you . Alone ? Aye . Why not ? He says you 're a non-believer . Me ? Hmm . All this fatalism , pre-destiny bit , he says you don 't buy it . As a sort of therapy , I do . Well , Henry certainly proved something with it out there just now . Most impressive . Yes , it was . And it was just what he needed , too . Oh ? To give him confidence . See , it worries him , my being a non-believer . Why , because he respects you , your views ? No , because he imagines that he needs me still . So do all the others . Rutna included . ( RUTNA SOBBING ) Hey . What 's wrong ? You ... You and that man Charles ... What ? You will take him . Who ? Where ? Why ? Why you think he give the yew leaves to your horses ? You mean your Masterji ? It was for time . ( SOBBING ) For time to persuade the man Charles . Persuade Charles ? He wants ... He wants to go with you . Protected , as you say . Chaperoned . All of them fussing over me , telling me I 'm too frail to move on ? To spread the word ? I 'm not strong enough to do what you 're doing , Charles . ( SCOFFS ) This escape . They 're scared and they 're insecure . Perfect example of group therapy jitters . The therapist , their guide and their support . Nudging , prodding , nurturing . But when he decides that they 're cured and ready to stand on their own , then he has to move on . He must . - And they don 't like it ? - Not one bit . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Now , please . Please . ( PEOPLE FALL SILENT ) If you accept that I 've helped you at all ... Well , of course you 've helped us , Frank . Then you must let me go , so that I can help others . It 's your health , Frank . ( PEOPLE MUTTERING IN AGREEMENT ) - But I 'm perfectly all right . - What about the times you 've fainted ? Now , look , we 're in danger of getting selfish here . All the best gurus have to travel , right ? - But his health ! - Won 't bloom with sheltering . Now , Mr Vaughan has shown that he 's a man who cares , right ? MAN : Mmm-hmm . Well , if Frank reckons he has to go , who better than Charles Vaughan to keep an eye out for him , eh ? ( PEOPLE MUTTERING IN AGREEMENT ) How are you feeling ? Empty as a ram 's codge at topping . Oh , thought you might . Here . For the patient . Egg special . Tuck in . - Do you like it ? - Mmm-hmm . Well , let 's see it , then . - Well ... - Oh , no , Dad . Your aura . - You what ? - The waves you give off , from here . Waves ? Aura emissions . Mood , temperament . Nobody ever tell you about auras before ? - No . - Hang about . Here . Now , Charles Vaughan 's mission is crucial , as he said . And one in which I can perhaps be of help , as a headhunter . Selecting the right people for the right jobs . My destiny ? Perhaps . But should I go against that ? But I promise you that I will come back . He will not return . - He has not the strength . - You love him , don 't you ? Then fight it , don 't just give in . - The guru must travel . - Guru ! He doesn 't believe in that . He 's just using it and you . Just as he 's using Charles and Hubert and me . All this talk of missions . Can you not see that ? It 's all selfishness , it 's hypocrisy , getting his own way . You must see that . - If you say it . - Well , what do you say ? It 's all this idiotic destiny , I suppose , fate . Just shrug your shoulders , bow your head and accept it . Like everything else , the Death plague included ? Death , birth , famine , plenty , drought , monsoons . How should we challenge such things , Jenny ? How ? You really are the eternal survivor , aren 't you ? ( SPEAKS PUNJABI ) And that 's why the Masterji found me and brought me here . To help these people find their new way . And why it is also I must now stay . Stay in silence , not help you to stop him . Oh , please , Jenny , it 's hard enough for her as it is . ( SCOFFS ) She worships him . So , for goodness sake , try and help . Help what ? - Him escape ? - CHARLES : Jenny ! It 's all just a cheap , dirty excuse . - CHARLES : Escape what ? - From responsibility , from her love . It 's the truth . Exactly , damn it , the same as you . - As me ? - Yes . All this high talk of pilgrimages and missions and blessed Norway . You 're a child . You 're a little boy playing at pilgrimages . - Now , stop this . - It 's the truth . Oh , you may con yourself , you may pretend it 's for real , but you don 't fool us . Not me nor Pet . It 's just a pathetic excuse to go swanning off and be fancy-free . - You just can 't forgive him , can you ? - Who ? Greg . That 's what all this is all about , all this fuss . All right , Mr Clever , maybe Greg is as irresponsible as you two . - Maybe . - Except ... what 's really bugging you , what 's been gnawing away at your gut for the last nine months is ... - is fear , uncertainty . - Of what ? Of the fact that Greg might not love you as he said he has . - What ? - That he might see your love , that your feelings , he might resent them because he might see them as love - but as possessiveness . - Oh , typical . You would have to say that , wouldn 't you ? Your typical reaction . The little woman , clinging and dependent . Well , it 's not true ! No ? You were quick enough to leave the children . That 's not fair . Intuitive , aren 't you ? I know Rutna loves me . Of course I do . And I love her . Then why don 't you stay with her ? Because ... Because , and you must promise not to tell anybody ... Give me your hand . - What is it ? - It 's a pacemaker . To stimulate the heartbeat . I had a severe heart block about eight years ago , and this pacemaker was installed to keep the pulse up to normal . It has a five-year battery . All quite routine in the days when heart surgery and isotopic nuclear batteries were available . - Frank , how ... - How long ? Who knows ? A year , two years . They said something about fainting . Well , it goes on the blink every once in a while and I give it a little reminder to keep it up to the mark . - And they don 't know ? - No . And they must never know , any of them . And least of all , Rutna . Be sure and carry on the good work . And spread the Brahminic word . Now , look , this is all very well , but suppose ... Don 't worry , Jenny . Don 't worry . He won 't hold us back . - Henry 's told me the way . - Where to ? Uh , a bloke they 've heard of who 's qualified in electrical engineering . Yes , his name is Campbell . He was with the Electricity Generating Board . - But Charles ... - The settlement he 's with , - it 's roughly east of here , yes ? - Roughly . - Charles , look ... - We can 't just go rushing past , Jenny . - You promised ! - I 'm sorry , Jenny . This man could be a key technician for Norway , for everything Greg 's driving at . Excuses ! I 'll be back . Keep it all fresh and alive for them , Henry . Now give me something hard to do . Oh , keeping them from getting dependent on you is the hard part .

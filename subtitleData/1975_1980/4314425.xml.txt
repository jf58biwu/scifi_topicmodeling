 ( Helena ) ' Moonbase Alpha status report , '403 days after leaving Earth 's orbit . 'Dr Helena Russell recording . ' For the sixth consecutive day , we 've been travelling in an area of space where the stars are so close that we 're constantly bathed in a lovely blue light . There are no patients in medical section , life-support systems are fine and the universe about us is incredibly peaceful . ( Alarm beeping ) Looks like a swarm of space bees ! Yeah , every one with an atomic sting in its tail , maybe . Range ? 980,000 and closing . Sensor reading ? 53 unknown objects . Dense , metallic . Length , ten feet . - Unable to compute intention . - Course ? Away from Alpha . We have magnification . - Those are missiles ! - Hold it ! If they 're passing , let ' em go . ( Alarm beeping ) Commander ! ( Tony ) They 're turning ! Red alert ! Launch Eagle flights one and two ! Prepare casualty reception . Rescue units stand by . Range closing , 180 ... 160 ... Raise defence shields . ( Sandra ) 130 ... 110 ... ( Koenig ) Arm main lasers . At this closing speed we 'll never get ' em all ! - Eagles on intercept . - Target ! There are too many of them . Some are bound to get through . - Range - critical . - Prepare to fire ! Commander ! Target changing course ! ( Koenig ) Hold fire ! - They 're pulling away ! - No , they 're locking into orbit . - Anything on armament ? - Still insufficient data . Sensors unable to probe the shell . Detonation possibilities ? Three - pressure , time-fuse or remote control . I want a transporter Eagle ready for immediate lift-off . We 've got to check them out . We can 't leave 50 missiles hanging over our heads . Alan , bring us in close to that lead pair . - Tell Tony we 'll take it from here . - ( Alan ) Right . I also want all other Eagles to return to base . Tony , Eagle Four . We 'll maintain the mission from here . Have all the other Eagles clear the area . - Eagles One and Two , back to base . - Confirm , return to base . ( Koenig ) Maya . Thank you . 'Alongside now , Commander . ' ( Koenig ) Stand by for depressurisation . 'Standing by . ' ( Jets hiss ) ( Koenig ) ' There 's no uniform formation . ' They 're in clusters - two , three and four . No evidence of electrical activity . No heat emission . ( Jets hiss ) Rocket motor propulsion . Gas ports . That means a guidance capacity . No longer functioning . - Got anything , John ? - ' Not enough for an assessment . ' 'For that , we 're going to have to take a look inside . 'I 'm bringing one down . ' Bringing one down ? ! Prepare one of the underground caves . I wanna be as far from Command Centre as possible when we open it . Let 's take it home ! You heard the man . Rescue , Medical and Decontamination units to underground research area . ( Alarm beeping ) Hold those doors ! Stand by . We 've safeguarded against the obvious dangers , bacteria , toxic chemicals ... All the rest is guesswork . Tony , I want you to hook us up to main computer . 'We 're gonna run every single test possible before we pierce this . ' Fellas , suit up . We 're bringing it in . All right . Let 's go . - Immediate relay . - ( Sandra ) Immediate relay . Begin the scan . ( Electrical ticking ) What have you got ? Theoretical possibilities about the construction . But nothing of practical value in terms of piercing it . - Helena ? - Without opening it up , there 's no data about the chemical or bacteriological dangers . ( Sighs ) We 'll have to go in blind . All right - we 're gonna cut it with a laser . Activate all safety precautions . ( High-pitched humming ) - Cylinder pierced , Commander . - Let 's take a look . ( Whirring ) Moving parts . There 's some sort of mechanism inside . - Perhaps a detonation device ? - Computer reaction ? No radiation increase , no bacteriological change , no pressure variation , no toxic chemical presence . Fill it with nitrogen . Freeze that device . Stay in there , Helena ! You too , Mathias ! Maya , are you all right ? Commander ... What is it ? It 's humanoid . And we 've just killed it . ( Heart monitor beeping slowly ) ( Beeping ) Dr Russell ! Start the defibrillator . ( Grunts ) - He 's alive ! - Alive ? - Just barely . - That 's impossible . The liquid nitrogen should have frozen him to death . He was already in deep freeze before we injected the container . Cryobiology - the application of freezing techniques to live tissue . He 's fading . Increase the voltage . Is there any chance he 'll make it ? We still can 't assess the effect of the explosion on him . - Tony . - ' Yeah ? ' Bring another one of those containers down . 'Prepare Eagle for launch . Any particular container ? ' - The twin of the one here . - Right . Why get another one ? We don 't know how to unseal it ! He can tell us how to open it . Keep him alive ! I 'm a doctor , John . I save life for the sake of saving life . They know the secret of space travel . Some day our survival may depend on that . We know part of the answer . There 's a plastic membrane covering his entire body . You can 't see it - it 's as fine as tissue . It 's insulating his heart against the electrical stimulation . - He 's fading again . - Double the voltage . - It 'll kill him ! - Double it . ( Grunts ) ( Helena ) We have normal respiration . Nurse ... Cantar ... My name is Cantar . Cantar ? My people ... You must save my people ... We will if you help us . Have you ... have ... have you sighted the others ? Yes . They 're in orbit around our base . You must recover them ... immediately ... The cylinders ... The cylinders ... - Let him rest , John . - We 've got to know . How do we open those containers ? They 're not constructed ... to withstand gravitational forces . If they 're left in orbit , they 'll shatter ... How do we open them without blowing them apart ? To relieve the internal pressure ... you must heat the capsule from the outside ... ( Rising and falling hum ) Heat 's seven points off maximum . Kill it . ( Whirring ) Maya . Zova ! She is my wife . ( Koenig ) Those containers were in pairs . In pairs , threes or fours , family groups . It appealed to their sadistic sense of humour . Whose sense of humour ? Where are you from ? I come from Golos - known to us as the Peace Planet . - You were invaded ? - No , we were cast out , exiled . It was an internal struggle . We were unarmed , helpless . The others were few in number - but ruthless . ( Electrical whine ) ( Heart monitor beeping ) Is she breathing ? She 'll be all right . You are humane people . You will save us all , I know that . Out of the question . Our life-support facilities cannot support any more . It 's impossible for us to bring those containers down . In 36 of your hours , gravity will shatter those containers . Can you stand by and let that happen ? Can you , Commander ? Dr Russell is in charge of life-support . Helena , would you try to explain ? We can 't even permit any new births here on Alpha . We can barely sustain the people we have . You see , Cantar ? We have no choice . We can give you a choice , Zova and myself . We can use our skills to increase your recycling capacity tenfold . In 36 hours ? If that 's all the time we have , yes . I 'm sorry . I can 't take the chance . You say you want to learn the secret You bring them down and I will give you the secret . No . Then , send us back ! Send Zova and myself back to die with our people . ( Tony ) Those are people out there , like you and me ! They look like you and me . That 's all we know . About their minds , their motives , we know nothing . John , they 're so young . Must you always assume the worst ? Yes , where the safety of Alpha is concerned . Then what do we do ? Abandon them and watch them die ? Helena , when I was an astronaut cadet , I was on a resupply mission to a Venus space station . As we were preparing to dock , a computer diagnosis informed us that 14 of the scientists up there were sick , three already dead . They had a disease unknown to Earth against which we had no antidote . My commander had to make a decision . He couldn 't bring that disease back to Earth . We left those men to die . John , this situation is entirely different . These people are free of any sickness . And if they can increase our life-support capacity , think what it can mean to us ! Helena , they may have something our sensors can 't detect . My concern is the survival of this base . What sort of society abandons 50 innocent beings ? We 're concerned about our survival , of course , John , but at what price ? Look , you asked what sort of people they are . What sort of people are we ? 'Commander ? ' Have Cantar come to my quarters immediately . - Thank you , John . - Don 't thank me yet . Dr Russell ... Commander ... - John ! - What are you doing ? Have you gone mad ? I had to make sure our weapons were effective against them . All right ... Let 's let them try to expand our life-support systems , but I want security men on duty at all times . OK . I 'll make sure they 're never alone in Life-Support . Don 't look so worried - he 'll be all right . He 'll regain consciousness in an hour . An hour ? It 's not such a long time - and there 'll be no ill effects . 'Moonbase Alpha status report - supplemental . Dr Russell reporting . 'Cantar and Zova have been working on life-support for 30 hours . 'Other personnel are back on daily routine , 'doing their jobs when on duty , relaxing when off . 'We 're all grateful Commander Koenig showed compassion to the aliens . 'There is once again a warm feeling of well-being on Moonbase Alpha . ' - ' Security , Life-Support . ' - Everything OK ? - ' Yes , sir . ' - Let me know of any changes . - Tony , I 'll be with Dr Russell . - Right . Maya , you would be the envy of every woman on Earth ! To change your hair colour at will , the colour of your eyes to match your dress , Take off a few pounds here , add an inch there . To change your very form . Wow ! ( Beep ) - ' Helena , can I come in ? ' - Give me a minute , John . I hope he likes it . Are you quite sure about Commander Koenig 's sense of humour ? Mm-hm . Helena ... All right ... which is it ? Well , of course , I can tell . Maya can only hold that shape for one hour . I 'll just wait . - Why wait that long ? - What did you have in mind ? - Very simple . Nothing to it . - Really ? There was absolutely no difference . Oh ! You know something ? I take back everything nice I 've ever said about you - including that you 're perceptive ! Helena , I think you 're needed in the research unit . Your friends are waiting to start work . And Maya , back to your station . Yes , Commander . You 're very talented - that 's terrific . I 'm glad you like it . I was going to give it to you . - " Was " ? - No difference , huh ? ( High-pitched screeching ) I 'll see you in the recreation room . ( Screams ) ( Alarm beeping ) Lift ! Can 't shift it . Maya , get down here right away ! - ' Medical Section . ' - Emergency , Area B. - What happened ? - Circuit overload . - Life-support system . - Life-support ? ( High-pitched screeching ) - Is it working ? - We 're making progress . We won 't know till the final test - in the power section . The power section 's off limits . Commander 's orders . I 'll talk to him . I 'm sure he 'll understand . I must try again . Doesn 't the sound bother you ? - No . - It does mine . I 'll be out here . Maya , the girder ! OK , that 's it ! Clear ! I don 't understand . It never happened before . ( Koenig ) And it won 't happen again ! Commander ! We have another casualty in here ! Get those aliens out of Life-Support ! Go ! - Final test . - Good luck . ( Whirring ) ( High-pitched screeching ) ( Helena screams ) ( Groaning ) ( Alarm beeping ) Cantar ! Stop ! Commander 's orders . No one 's to go in there . Maya , wait , let 's not explode like a couple of rockets . Play it cool - we don 't want to panic them , OK ? ( Electronic whistle ) ( Electronic whistle ) Maya ! ( Snarls ) ( Screams ) ( Maya snarling ) ( High-pitched squealing ) The door 's jammed , Commander ! ( Inaudible ) Give me that ! Mator ! Exiles ! A puny weapon against us , but it has its uses . Destroy the system and in hours hundreds will be dead ! Bring Ragnar here . Tell him Cantar will destroy all life on Golos unless he comes . Bring him ! You look at me with surprise , Dr Russell . Contempt . You 're like the people here on Golos - crippled by your moral ideas of loyalty , gratitude and fair play ! And you and Zova are free spirits , I suppose ? Free to hate , threaten and kill ! You 're wasting your breath . He doesn 't even understand . No ! Let her speak ! Yes ! It amuses us ! - I see why you were exiled . - But why didn 't they kill you ? I have come as you wished , Cantar . Ragnar ! I want Ragnar ! Ragnar is dead . Long dead . I am Mirella , chief councillor of Golos . - His daughter ? - His descendent . Ragnar died over 300 years ago . Of course ! Time on Golos continued while we floated frozen in space . In Ragnar 's time , you were cast out for crimes against our people . Now you come back with weapons and threats of destruction ! - Are these your allies ? - We 're his prisoners . Two of you can 't hope to hold all of Golos to ransom forever ! Two of us now - but there will be more . On Moonbase Alpha , we have the ideal platform to recover our people . Commander Koenig won 't let you . Zova will make sure he does . - Activity in Life-Support . - Give me visual . 'Commander Koenig , I think we should talk . ' A simple arrangement - you recover our people and we return Helena Russell and Tony Verdeschi . You do know how to show gratitude ( ! ) Contact is possible . Can I give him your answer ? You 're asking me to sell a whole planet into slavery ? No , I won 't do it . You forget - we have Dr Russell . And we have you ! ( Helena screaming ) ( Cantar laughing ) ( Helena screaming ) Stop ! ( Screams fade ) Well , Commander ? - All right . - A word of caution , Commander . Your life-support systems are now tuned to my mental processes . I can destroy them by simple concentration . And you would ! If you give me cause . We will recover the containers . Begin preparations . 'Yes , Commander . ' ( Door opens ) You can 't do it , Commander ! You think I have a choice ? The transfer process nearly blew our whole life-support power system . Transferring 50 more people would inevitably destroy it ! - Launch recovery Eagles . - ' Yes , sir . ' - Ten miles , Commander . - ' All right , Alan . ' Let us know when we 're alongside . Tell them - tell the people we are the new rulers of Golos . Tell them , or I will destroy the main life plant ! ( Mirella ) People of Golos ... This is your chief councillor Mirella . 300 years ago ... That protective membrane ... Get his attention . Divert him . Right . Those exiles have now returned . ( Alan ) ' Alongside , Commander . ' All right . Let 's get ready . - Stand by for depressurisation . - ' Standing by . ' We have no choice but to surrender to them . ( Yelling ) Later , you 'll suffer for this ! Zova ! ( Cantar ) ' The lifeline ! He unhooked it ! ' ( Alarm blaring ) You 'll die for what Koenig has done . You 're getting old , Cantar ! I 'm young ! I was young when Ragnar was alive and I 'm still young ! Time is running out , Cantar ! - Nothing 's changed ! - You have changed . No ! You can 't win ! Your protective membrane - it 's gone ! It 's pierced . Look at yourself ! ( Helena ) You 're no longer young , Cantar ! You 're ageing ! Every second , you 're ageing ten years ! ( Helena ) Cantar ! ( Helena ) You 're beginning to decay , Cantar ! You 're getting feeble ! Your mind is slowing down ! Your muscles won 't respond ! You 're too feeble to fire that gun ! Cantar , you 're 300 years old ! ( Cantar groaning ) Thank you . On behalf of the millions on Golos , I thank you . - Are you all right , Tony ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . What happened ? I 'll tell you when we get back to Alpha . Can you help us get back to Alpha ? ( Maya ) I 've double-checked the calculations . The anti-gravity effect will return them to their original course . ( Koenig ) Activate ! Commander ! I 'm registering a tremendous surge of energy from the Power Section . What took you so long ? Who said there was an emergency ? If this was a military base , you 'd be court-martialled . - Court-martialled ? - Mm-hm . " Court martial . " A military or naval trial for breach of discipline . " Me ? ! It 's all over Alpha . That switch you pulled on the Commander . First rule of any chain of command , don 't embarrass the man in charge ! In your world , a kiss causes embarrassment ? In yours too , since you had to change into another woman ! It 's more fun that way ! Would you like to try ? Go on , Tony . I 'm waiting , Tony ! - You 've got a long wait ! Ciao ! - Shallow - that 's what you are ! What does it matter what I look like on the outside ? It 's still me inside ! Kiss me ! Be known as a man of principle ! I 'd sooner be known as a man of taste ! - Oh , Tony ! - Maya ! I bet there 's a big , long story about how this happened ... I didn 't do it . And you probably think I look better that way ... - I can explain ... - I bet you can ! - Helena ... - I 'll tell you what ... What ? Make me a pretty nose .

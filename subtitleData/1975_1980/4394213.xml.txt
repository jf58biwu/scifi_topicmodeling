 'Be 9 : 24 ... be 9 : 24 ... ' ... be 9 : 24 ... be 9 ... ' - Is Steel back yet ? - From where ? - He went outside . - Well , no . The rain 's stopped . Storm must have passed . Silver , nothing 's supposed to change here . It 's still 9 : 24 . - What shall I do ? - You 'd better find him . - Oh , who is it ? - What ? The person who 's come here , who is it ? - It didn 't happen . - We heard someone arrive . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Mercury , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' Thank you . It 's one of my children . There . Got a kiss for Johnny Jack and all the children on his back ? Oh , well . Where did you come from ? Where did I come from ? How can I answer that ? - Just try . - I come from 250 different places . These doors were locked . Not when I come in . Shop . - Shop ! - There 's no one there , I 'm afraid . - No one in the kitchen ? - No . - Where 's the staff ? - There is no staff . - Yet it 's open ? - Yes . So what do you do ? Help yourself ? I 'll help meself . Got a kiss for Johnny Jack ... and all the children on his back ? Don 't you touch her . Like the coat . What do you want here ? I want service , that 's what I want here . In the meantime , this is mine . My squat . Are you the manager or something ? - How did you arrive here ? - How did I what ? To this place , how did you get here ? By minding me own business and not answering questions . I 've had nothing but questions since the minute I walked in . First she started and now you ... Has something happened here ? Something wrong ? Oi , something happened here ? Did you walk ? Drive ? What ? I walked , didn 't I ? Do you mind ? - Walked from where ? - I said do you mind ? I 'm sorry but that happens to be one of the tools of my trade . - I said , walked from where ? - I don 't know where from . - You forget ? - I don 't have to remember . - The others ... - The others ? The others in the company . They do all the thinking . - A company of performers ? - That 's right . - Makes sense . - It doesn 't . How did he get here ? I walked . Whatever it is that 's going on here , I had nothing to do with it . I wasn 't here , whatever it was . You walked from where ? They dropped me off by the turnpike . They was going into town and I didn 't want to go . So they told me to meet ' em here . " Wait by the service station , " that 's what they said , so I walked . Let go ! I only wanted a tea . What sort of people are you ? Who are you ? You 've done nothing but throw your weight around . Well , if this is the future , you can keep it . Doesn 't it worry you that you 've been brought from the past and trapped ? Of course that worries me . - What about him ? - He has every right ... There 's no time here . What 's he doing here ? - He 's right . - No what ? No , why should they be right ? He just happened to be passing by . - Here , in the present . - Right . He just came in . He walked through the doors and came in . - For a cup of tea . - Ask him what the date is . - Ask him . - No . Excuse me . What day is it today ? - What , you mean the date ? - Yes . - The 15th or something . - 15th of what ? July , of course . - And the year ? - The what ? - What year is it ? - How do you mean ? What year ? ! - This year . - You don 't know ? We forget . It 'd better be the same as it was when I woke up this morning - 1957 . - It rang ? - Yes . - Then what ? - I answered it . And ? - ' ... be 9 : 24 ... ' - I got what you 're getting now . ' ... be 9 : 24 ... ' Two people from 1948 ... And an old man from 1925 . And this character from 1957 . It doesn 't make sense . The numbers don 't compute to make any sense . Is there anything special about those years ? Nothing of great historical importance , no . But ... There 's ... there 's something wrong . - For us ? - Yes . I 'm going to take another look round . If it 's any consolation , we 've had one tiny victory . - That ? - Yes ! I checked it . It was made in 1957 and has no sinister elements . But you and I are looking for different things . How did you get it away from him ? While you were keeping him busy , I made a quick reproduction . He 'll never know the difference . Now then ... 'Show me more . 'I said show me . 'Show me more . 'I said show me . ' - What was that ? - Hm ? Oh , that was me ? Something wrong ? Seeing as you 're outside , give us a shout , will you ? - A shout ? - Yeah . If you see a grey van , that 'll be me mates only I 'm busy , you see . Right , I 'll give you a shout . Might put on a bit of a show later , if there 's time . - Like that , would you ? - Possibly . - I bet you would . - Sorry ? Bit of a show , knees-up on the table . You 'd love that , wouldn 't you ? - No . - It 's a chance to cheer up a bit . Why don 't you get on with whatever it is you 're doing and leave us alone ? - No appreciation . - Shame . It 's a tragedy . I 'm the best tambourine player there , I 'm the only musician amongst them . Play something . - What , now ? - Now . When the others come , eh ? All right , I 'll look forward to that . I don 't trust these - any of them . And as Sapphire says , there 's nothing really sinister about it . - Nothing that could harm us . - Then why don 't you trust them ? Well , it 's as if ... as a musical instrument , it 's never been played . Every instrument that ever was or is , is its own recording device . - Did you know that ? - No . Ah . Well , listen ... Do you hear that ? That 's just a noise . This instrument has only ever made a noise , never music . Well , it 's a drum . You can 't expect it to play a tune . No , but we can expect it to make music . Some sort of rhythm , properly handled of course . You 're saying a man who 's part of travelling company made up of ... Musicians and performers . - Should be able to play music on it . - Yes . Especially when he 's the only real musician amongst them . - What ? - His words . If you can make a reproduction of a tambourine ... could you make one of a car ? A car ? Well , a car would be more difficult . With Sapphire 's help we could probably make an image . - An illusion . - Would that be enough to allow you to remove the real one for a closer inspection ? - The image would fool them visually . - That should be enough . Makes it a long day when there 's no time . When we 've done this , I 'm going out there , to where the traffic sounds are . I 'd like to know what would happen if we tried to leave . Under the circumstances , so would I. Now , you want me to project an image of the car ? Yes . As you did the last time , only a fixed one this time . So ... You 're telling me that I 'm more than 20 years adrift ? - Yes . - And this is the future ? Get away ! Well , look about you . Isn 't this a little different to what you 're used to ? All places look the same to me . I never need to look . He 's telling the truth . - What ? We don 't get any older ? - Apparently not . So what 's 20-odd years ? ! Now , you project the image the moment I drive this thing away . But Silver , won 't they hear it ? For a fraction of a second , perhaps . I shan 't be driving in a conventional way . - Are you ready ? - Yes . Right . The future could be a lot of fun , providing the price of a pint hasn 't changed . A pint of what ? - What 's that ? - What ? Silver , it must be now . That sounded like a motor . Your friends , where are they ? Somewhere . I 'm not sure . All right ? I 'm not sure . Hey ... Are you going to leave me in there with that freak ? Why ? What 's he done to you ? Well , nothing . It 's what he might do . Sorted it out , did you ? Just a minute ! I want to talk to you . Go ahead . Well , not here . It 's about him , you see . - Your man friend ? - Yes . I want to tell you the truth about him . Take me with you , will you ? Please take me with you , it 's important . Where 's Silver ? He 's gone to look for a way out . - Is it unlocked ? - It is now , yes . - Wait in there . - How did that get in here ? - I 'll tell you later . - No . Tell me now . OK , I 'll wait in here . What 's she doing here ? She has something to tell us . Why don 't you find out what it is ? I 'm not talking to you . Not just you . I 'm not saying anything to you . You never once left that caf√© , only now . You hardly moved from the table . You 're afraid to leave your friend 's side for more than a few moments and here you are now with me . - I 've explained . - Not to me you haven 't . Who are you ? Look ... I 've got things to say , all right ? - Things to tell you . - Then tell me . No , not unless all three of you are here . If you hurt me , I shan 't help you . I shan 't help any of you . You 're gonna need me . 'Show me . 'Show me more . 'I said show me . 'More . ' Your eyes ... What 's happened to your eyes ? What did she say ? Sapphire ? Steel ! It 's our death . Our destruction . - The danger I sensed in the yard . - A sensation of fear . They 're playing tricks with your mind . No , I was sensing violence . Our destruction , yours and mine . So it wasn 't an emotion from the past - from the future . Yes . Our future . But why ? Steel ... They 're like us , Steel . But they 're like us ! - The same as us ? - Well , almost . How do they differ ? I think they answer to a higher authority .

 Avalanche ! I have no control over the use of my creations ! - No responsibility ! - Then who does ? Hold on ! They " re using the intakes ! Fire . " There are those who believe " that life here " began out there , " far across the universe , " with tribes of humans " who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians " or the Toltecs or the Mayans . " Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man " who even now fight to survive " somewhere beyond the heavens . " ( Adama ) " In part one of Gun On Ice Planet Zero ... " I just have the feeling that we " re being carefully manoeuvred . We " re being herded into this safe passage ahead . ( Centurion ) Pump system to speed . L " m picking up a flare . A brilliant bead of light , like an eclipse . L " m going to check it out . Locked on target . Fire . ( Starbuck ) " We " re under attack . " Battle stations ! Flight officer ! ( Alarm ) Starbuck , they " re forcing me down . - Is it something serious ? - No . We " re just handing the fleet over to a bunch of criminals . There " s not much difference between you and your fellow convicts and us . We are all live for the promise of freedom and fear the same death . Cylons . We " re going down ! Search for wreckage . Leave no survivors . They " re clones . You came to destroy the Ravashol pulsar . - Ravashol ? - He is the Father Creator . - Cylon patrol . - Everybody down . ( Adama ) " And now , the exciting conclusion of Gun On Ice Planet Zero . " The way is clear now . So you " re not turning us in to the Cylons . No , we hate the Cylons . We are Theta-class life forms , considered by the Cylons to be subhuman . We were created for slave labour . Most of our brothers and sisters are still slaves . But you revolted . - Evidently we are not perfect . - No . Just human . Will you help us destroy the pulsar ? First we must get into the village . Come . ( Muffit barking ) This is the entrance to our underground city . ( Distant chatter ) This leads to the base of the research station . We must get to the top of that mountain . - There is one who can help . - Who ? Father Creator - Ravashol . - He " s here ? In the village ? - He lives at the base of Mount Hekla . - You " ll take me to him ? - To free my people ? Yes . But first I " ll take your people to safety . The probe that landed on the planet " s surface - it was destroyed ? Not exactly . - Not exactly ? - Control yourself , my friend . You " ll blow a circuit , or I believe you call it a blood vessel . Quite flimsy compared to ... I do not need a lesson in anatomy . Where are our fighters ? Close to the point of no return . Still hectares from the Galactica . Have them attack the Galactica . But they will not have enough fuel to return . That " s suicide . - They " re machines ! - We are all machines . Even you , of a sort . With a probe on the surface and possible survivors , I must push the Galactica forward . Even if they were human pilots , I would give the same order . Yes , I believe you would . By your command . ( Screams ) - Cylons are searching the village . - Take the others and hide them . - But where ? - With the children . - Hear that , Muffit ? There are children ! - ( Barks ) - Children ? - We were thought to be sterile . It was a Cylon mandate to maintain the purity of the Theta life form . - But we have been bearing children . - And hiding them ? Yes . Father Creator , please do not call for help . You are not permitted here . Only planners . Father Creator , we are in need of your help . - You " re one of the 5 series . - Yes . Series 5 , Culture 9 . You are not one of mine . You " re a human . Flight Captain Apollo from the Battlestar Galactica . The Galactica is a vessel of war . I have no use for war or violence . You have a strange way of showing it . What " s that on the mountain , a weapon of peace ? It is an energy lens system to transmit intelligence across the galaxy . Your energy lens system has fried two of my fighters and is holding the Colonial fleet at bay until the Cylons can destroy it . Impossible ! My system is maintained by Series 5 Theta life forms . With all reverence , they are whipped if they come near the pulsar . You are wrong ! I make adjustments , repairs , I transmit . My helpers are Series 5 ! Right now your pulsar is manned by Cylons as a weapon of war . A temporary misuse . A temporary abuse . So you know how it " s being used ! I have no control over the use of my creations ! - No responsibility ! - Then who does ? ( Beep ) " Dr Ravashol , permission to enter . " Cylons ! Behind the research stacks , in the equipment cases . Hide him ! Enter . Why did you keep us waiting ? Would you like me to ruin my work ? These are delicate compounds . - Search . - What do you think you " re doing ? The garrison commander will hear of this . - We have orders to search . - We " ll see about that . This is Dr Ravashol . I want to speak to the command Centurion . " Dr Ravashol . " Why is my work being disrupted ? There is a patrol here . We are searching for humans . I know nothing about humans . Please order your Centurions to go so I may continue my work . Only planners are permitted to visit you . He " s here because I need a strong back to move some equipment . Leave Dr Ravashol to his research . Punish the worker clone . He " s here at my orders ! ( Woman ) Cylons ! Cylons ! Help ! - This is our chance to go . - We " ve more chance on the mountain . Why couldn " t you leave us alone ? If you hadn " t come , all would be peaceful ! We had no choice . The Cylons forced us here . They are out to exterminate every human in the universe . - Even you will go . - They let me live . They understand my work . You want to destroy everything I " ve created . Before you came , everything was in its place . - Planners to think , workers to work . - L " ve got news for you . Your workers are thinking and breeding . - Impossible . - Tell that to the children they " ve hidden . Children ? If you won " t help me to save the lives in the fleet , do it for the Thetas . In a sense , they " re all your children . We " ve picked up a Cylon fighter squadron . - How many ? - An attack phalanx . - They " re beginning to press . - Battle stations . - Order Blue Squadron to patrol the rear . - ( Alarm ) ( Rigel ) " Vector coordinates coded and transferred . " Launch Bay Alpha , stand by to launch fighter patrol . " Launch when ready . " Enemy approaching . 100 microns and closing . " - Protect the freighters . - Blue Leader , engage . Have our fighters engaged the Galactica ? Yes . But they will not have enough fuel to return . Break off the attack . Baltar , I believe my sound sensor mishears you . I said break off the attack ! It will force Adama to believe ... that we are even closer than we are in actuality . Very clever . A little hard on our troops but very clever . By your command . Why are they withdrawing ? Secure quarters . They " ll be back in packs like wild animals . How long until the landing party completes its mission ? Irrelevant . We must move forward in exactly ... 420 centons , whether they " re successful or not . There are two chambers , one housing the pulsar , the other a small garrison . The only way to destroy it is to jam or reverse the main pump . It " s not easy but it can be done . Here , here and here . Quick , we must hide these humans . He won " t hurt you ! He " s just a daggit ! Where " s Thane ? I don " t know , maybe he got separated . He " s been looking for a chance to make a break . - We " d better go find him . - Wait . Let us do it . As you can see , strangers are easy to single out here . Come . What is your purpose here ? Just visiting . How many of you are there ? I travel alone . L " ve always been a little antisocial . - You are from the Galactica . - Never heard of it . The Cylons have captured one of your party . - L " ll go . - You " re not going anywhere . I need you to scale the mountain . Take me to where they have Thane . - The Cylons will recognise you . - Not if I " m dressed like a Theta . - All this risk for one man ? - He might betray us . Are you sure it " s Thane you want to save and not the other one ? Who else are you looking for ? Lt " s a pilot I lost . Just a kid , really . His name " s Cree . If he survived , the Cylons will have him . For his sake , I hope he didn " t . Take him to a cold cell . I will examine his cortex later . No ! No ! No ! How many combat ships in the fleet ? Tough question . There " s so many . How many ? Starbuck ! - Where " s Apollo ? - He is with Ravashol . - Is he safe ? - He is in hiding . Can Ravashol be trusted ? He saved Ser 5-9 from the Cylons . - Looks like they caught you . - Ravashol lied to save me . I prefer being whipped to being killed . In my inner pocket there " s a tape coder . The information you want is recorded in it . Just press that button . We " d better get back . That " s no way to greet a fellow warrior . I left you in charge . What happened ? Thane " s dead . - But he didn " t betray us . - We got a problem . - Ravashol says ... - Father Creator helped you ? Yes . He says our only chance is a simultaneous attack . One garrison is stationed outside the pulsar , the other on the gun . You " re in charge of taking the garrison . - I won " t let you down . - L " m counting on it . - Let " s set our timepieces at 200 centons . - Got it . We " ll reach the top and start our attack in exactly 200 centons . The Galactica will be moving forward after that . - For all our sakes , don " t be late . - L " ll be there . One of the clones told me the Cylon fighters are located at the top of the mountain , just behind the pulsar emplacement . When we get there , we grab one ! And go where ? How long before Galactica hunts us down ? The Galactica is the hunted . Adama won " t waste a squadron hunting down three ex-convicts . He knows that ! Why are your sympathies with those who chained you ? The Galactica and the entire fleet are finished . They will be if we don " t knock out that pulsar . Right . They " ll all be destroyed and we " ll be free ! We can find another planet . Starlos isn " t far . We can pick up food and water and fuel . Are you with us , or are you going to turn your back on freedom again ? I could not shoot down a Colonial warrior . Oh , yes , I know - the code , the bloodline . And for all your compassion , they chained you like an animal ! Now is your chance ! Our chance . One last time , my husband . Are you with us ? L " m with you . Good news . Some of our fighters may have enough fuel to rendezvous with us . Well , at least 30 % . Good . Have them re-engage the Galactica . But Baltar , they just disengaged . Yes ! It will drive Adama crazy . - He " s not the only one . - You said something ? By your command . ( Rigel ) Enemy closing . 10 microns . - ( Adama ) General quarters . - Closing in , five microns . ( Rigel ) Blue Squadron up . Launch when ready . Activate the laser turrets . ( Radio chatter ) Cylon attacking fighters have retreated but Cylon battlestars are entering the quadrant . Our time is up , Colonel . Flank speed ahead ! We " re going right through . By your command . " Our base ships have arrived and are closing on the Galactica . " What is the status of the pulsar ? " - Fully operative . - " Initiate random firing . " Sweep the entire corridor . Begin at once . " By your command . Notify summit station . Random sweeps covering the corridor . ( Alarm blaring ) Lens system aligned . Pulsar ready to fire . Commence firing . ( Adama ) My God . ( Operator ) Yes , I read you . Fire . Avalanche ! ( Groaning ) That " s one I owe you . ( Pulsar firing ) His leg - he " ll never make it to the top of the mountain . - Can you get him down ? - I think so . - Do it ! - What about the pulsar ? We " ll take it from here . Let " s go ! We " ve only got 80 centons left ! Fire . ( Omega ) We " re getting within range . The expedition must have failed . They still have 70 centons . Fire . ( Rigel ) lt " s closing . 68 centons . If we " re gonna go ... it " s got to be now ! ( Pulsar firing ) L " m with you . There " s nowhere you can go , Wolfe ! There " s a squadron of Cylon fighters the other side of the hill . We " re getting off this piece of ice . There isn " t time ! The Galactica " s passing through the quadrant ! - We " ve got to silence that gun ! - I don " t care about the Galactica . The Galactica is the only ship in the galaxy that can protect you . Without us you " re finished ! I don " t think you realise who is finished here . The Cylons won " t rest until we " re all dead . Don " t worry , Captain , we " re gonna make it . - To where ? - Well , now ... that isn " t really going to matter ... to you . Wolfe ! ( Apollo ) Don " t shoot ! He " ll never make it . He " s not getting away , he " s as good as dead . We " ve got to go with him . It " s our only chance . We " re here on a mission - a mission to save the last remains of a once-civilised race . And we " re going to do it ! You understand that ? This mission goes through . - ( Pulsar fires ) - Let " s get moving . Time is running out . L " m putting you in charge . Get us into that pulsar station . We " ve only got 62 centons . We " re approaching Cylon scanning range . They " ll have a fix on us at any moment . Commander ... I suggest we let all the ships move at maximum speed . We jeopardise the fleet if we maintain the speed of the slowest ship . Execute . Galactica to all ships . Accelerate to maximum possible speed . Increase interval spacing . And good luck . Where is the Galactica ? 60 centons and closing . 50 centons and closing . Maintain random firing . Fire . Hard to starboard . 42 centons . L " ll be with you as fast as I can . - Where you going ? - To settle a debt . - You " re going to what ? - Don " t wait more than 20 centons . This is the intake for the cooling system . Laser " s inside . We don " t have enough solenite to blow it all up . Ravashol said the key element is the energy exchange pump . If we can wreck it , the gun will overload and blow itself up . Let " s take a look . We " ve only got 35 centons to go . I hope Starbuck " s on schedule . The emergency escape hatch . The cold cells where the Cylons hold prisoners are directly below . - There " ll be guards . - It " ll take " em by surprise . Nobody breaks into prison . - Starbuck ! - Can you walk ? - I can try . - Let " s go . - Where is the Galactica ? - 30 centons and closing . Fire . - Hard to port . - Helm hard to port . - That was close . - Hard to starboard . Commander , we have to turn back . We " ll never make it . ( Rigel ) 27 centons and closing . Hold on ! They " re using the intakes ! ( Wind rushing ) Let " s go ! Hurry up , we " ve only got 25 centons . Come on . In here . Wait . Listen ... - You risked your life to save his . - Seemed like a good trade then . You are very courageous . I don " t wish to betray my people but ... But what ? - They will help you destroy the Cylons . - I know . They will not allow you to destroy the pulsar . How will they stop us ? Apollo and the others are setting the charges . I do not know how , only that they will - by whatever means . Let " s talk to your people . That " s the firing station in the middle . It controls the energy pump . - Is that the target ? - Blow that and it overloads . It " ll blow off the top of the mountain . 20 centons . Fire . - Increase spacing between ships . - Yes , sir . Cylon base stars , quadrant Epsilon . Closing rapidly . There " s your answer , Colonel . We can " t turn back . We must move forward . We " ll get through . We must get through . We " ll help you destroy the garrison . The pulsar weapon belongs to us . Keep that gun and the Galactica is blown out of the sky . When news of our revolt reaches a Cylon outpost or base ship , they will come here in their fighters to destroy us . You will have gone . We will be here alone and defenceless unless we have the pulsar to repel them . Can " t you hear it ? ( Pulsar firing ) The Galactica is the last Colonial battlestar . The fate of an entire race depends on it ! - That is not our concern . - But it is mine . ( Gasps ) I am a member of that race that is fleeing the Cylon tyranny . Father Creator . It is for our protection that I speak . We will not be subjugated again by machines . - We are not perfect ... - But you are human . More human than I had anticipated . I shall review my notes to see where I went wrong . Those are your brothers out there in space . We have to help them . Destroy the pulsar . I will protect you . - ( Apollo ) Eight centons to go . - We go now or not at all . All the way or not at all . - We are with you . - ( All ) Let " s go . How will you protect them ? I didn " t give the Cylons everything I " ve created . Five centons . You take the three at the firing station , I " ll take the two at the door . For the glory of Caprica . For once in your life don " t be late , Starbuck . Four centons and closing . Fire . Heads up . Three centons and closing . ( Rigel ) Commander , we " ll be in range in one centon . Ready ? Now ! Let " s go ! We " re almost out of time ! Croft ! Fire . That was too close . Why haven " t they stopped it ? - The garrison ? - Wiped out . You go ahead . L " ll get Croft . Croft , we " ve only got a few microns left . Why would she do that ? Why would she save my life ? Let " s go . Fire . 45 microns and closing . 40 microns , 39 ... What if the blast cuts the cable ? We " ll find out . 33 , 32 , 31 , 30 microns . Time to leave , kids . Let " s go ! - My father ! - L " m taking you to him , kid . ( Rigel ) 14 , 13 ... ( Centurion ) Ten ... ( Rigel ) Nine ... Eight , seven , six , five , four , three ... ( Rigel ) Two ... ( Centurion ) One . Fire . Commander , we " ve picked up an explosion on the surface ! A big one ! Can you read position ? The mountain ! They " ve done it . They " ve done it ! ( Cheering ) - Secure quarters ! - Normal operations . Send out a rescue unit with full fighter escort . Aye aye , sir . Baltar , I bring grave news . - It cannot be . - L " m afraid it can . A handful of humans successfully destroyed the Ravashol pulsar . Despite all of your garrisons and squadrons and the biggest weapon in the universe ? But the strategy was yours , Baltar . I recommend we come up with a solid front to explain this debacle to the imperious Leader . Very well . But I will yet have the last laugh on Adama , mark my words . Don " t I always , Baltar ? I haven " t seen emotion in a long time . It " s good to see it again . - The Cylons will be back . - We " ll take care of them . You may have trouble with your children , they " re getting more and more human . L " m glad . Peace be with you . May you get to where you " re going . Peace be with you , Father Creator . - Let " s go home ! - ( Man ) Goodbye ! Good luck ! Let " s go home ! Let " s go , Starbuck . Captain , wait . This is the chance of a lifetime . Three versions of the same beautiful woman . - Imagine the possibilities . - I can . - You can ? - Yeah . Another time . Captain ... Bye . Well , you win one , lose one . I just lost all three . ( Adama ) " Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny , " the last battlestar , Galactica , " leads a ragtag fugitive fleet " on a lonely quest - " a shining planet " known as Earth . " What do you want in return for the energiser ? I want you . What did you promise her in return for that energiser ? - Two agro ships are destroyed . - The third ? ( Tigh ) She suffered heavy damage . Lost her airlock . ( Apollo ) Father . ( Adama ) The Borays are coming . You are in as much danger as we are . " There are those who believe " that life here " began out there , " far across the universe , " with tribes of humans " who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians " or the Toltecs or the Mayans . " Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man " who even now fight to survive " somewhere beyond the heavens . " Prepare to attack Colonial warriors . - How many got by our intercept ? - ( Boomer ) " I counted six . " Hopefully the Galactica will get them before they do much damage . ( Apollo ) " This is Blue Leader , come in Galactica . " This is Galactica , Blue Leader . Put on your bracers and hang on . A few of them got through . - Order red alert . - Yes , sir . ( Alarm ) Notify all ships in the fleet to expect imminent attack from unknown number of Cylons . Greenbean , form on me . There " s a pair after the agro ships on the perimeter . You would worry about that . Hit those , you " ll have nothing to eat . ( Jolly ) " That isn " t funny , Greenbean . Hurry . " Commander , Cylons withdrawing . - All but two destroyed . - All right . - Cancel red alert . - Yes , sir . - Damage report . - You aren " t going to like it . - Two agro ships are destroyed . - The third ? She suffered heavy damage . Lost her airlock . That " s repairable . It " s just like you see . When we lost our airlock , we lost our crop . We won " t be able to force-grow enough to feed our planters , let alone anyone else in the fleet . OK , we " ve fixed the airlock . Do you need more planters , more nutrients ? Whatever you need , you " ve got it . - We need new seed . - New seed ? New seed . Yes , I know , Colonel , but it " s not a complete disaster . That small planet our advance patrol discovered - in that quadrant nearby ... - Yes ? It appears there " s a small human agricultural settlement there . - That " s too good to be true . - L " ve asked Apollo to get an energiser from one of the older ships . - I don " t think I follow . - The point is , there isn " t an outpost in the star system that doesn " t need more power to sustain life . I figure we get an old energiser to trade for new seeds . That " s easy . We have energisers all over this battlestar . They run everything . But they have Colonial markings . What we need is an old energiser with no markings . No one will know who we are and no one can sell us out to the Cylons . - ( Door bleeping ) - Enter . Apollo . Did you find an energiser that might fit the bill ? - Er , yes . - Good . - It was made on Orion . - Excellent ! Perfect . No one would know it " s Colonial . - Er ... - What " s the matter ? The woman who owns it doesn " t want to give it up . - The woman ? - Siress Belloby . Well , we " ll just have to appropriate Siress Belloby " s energiser - and get it to the planet . - She " s not willing to give it up . Captain , to save every man , woman and child from starvation , - we " ll have to talk to her . - That " s exactly what she said . Only she wants Commander Adama to talk to her . What " s the problem ? Just order her to give it up . You don " t understand , Tigh . No one orders Siress Belloby to do anything . ( Apollo ) " Shuttle requesting permission to dock with Gemini freighter . " - This won " t work . - This isn " t something you can avoid . - Apollo , you go and you charm her . - Oh , no . ( Woman ) Come in , Adama . All right . Let " s go in . After you . To think I would have the honour of having the great Commander Adama visit me in my humble little dwellings . The pleasure is mine , Belloby . Then please , sit down . - Thank you . - It " s been a long , long time . Flowers ? For me ? Oh , I thought this was a business call . A man can always take the time to recognise the ... beauties of life . Oh , you must need that energiser so badly . Sit . All right , then , let " s negotiate . What do you want in return for the energiser ? Oh , Adama ... After all these years , I think that should be obvious . I want you . ( Apollo ) There " s no reason for you to go . I have been cooped up on this ship for 16 quatrons . L " m going on this mission and we are now in range . You " re desperately needed here . Apollo , if we don " t have seeds , we don " t have food . If we don " t have food , we will all perish . So please stop making objections and get the launch ready with provisions for five . - Yes , sir . - Yes , sir . Wait a minute . You , me , Starbuck , Boomer ... that makes four of us . Siress Belloby will be going with us . Siress Belloby on a mission ? Uh , Father ... what did you have to promise her in return for that energiser ? I made a promise to court her . I did not specify when or where and I certainly will not embarrass you . So let " s stop this talking , get on with it , get it over with , because we must have those seeds ! ( Tigh ) The planet Sectar . Stand by to launch mission . - ( Muffit barks ) - You " re leaving me alone again ? Er , Boxey , I " m a warrior . Sometimes I must go on missions to places unsafe for a little boy . Aren " t you just going for fresh seeds ? Yeah , but there " s ... You know something ? You " re right . It " s not dangerous . If Siress Belloby can go , why not you ? - Right ? - And Muffy ? - ( Barks ) - Of course , Muffy . - Yeah ! Yeah ! - ( Barks ) Standing by to launch . All functions transferred to shuttle . Launch . An adventure to a distant star . Oh , isn " t it downright romantic ? ( Adama ) " As important as our quest for seed , " the planet our scouts located " supports a small band of human inhabitants - " perhaps the remnants of pioneers " who set out yahrens ago from our own Colonies . " Even more hopefully , they might be descendants of the 13th tribe , " those elusive brothers of man who might lead us to the planet Earth . " ( Music and chatter ) ( Woman laughing raucously ) Oh , God ! The moon is up ! The lights . ( Thunder of hooves ) Farnes , I hate to tell you but ... it " s time . As if I didn " t know . You can feel the whole herd coming at us . A lot of good this " ll do . Wouldn " t stop a hedge-hopper . They " re herd creatures . Your mere presence " ll stop them from pillaging . It " s their way . All you have to do is stand out there . - Make a show of force . - Is that what the last constable did ? The one before him ? The one before him ? If there " s one thing this town despises more than the Borays , it " s cowardice . Once a man accepts that badge ... I know , I know . He " s got it for life . However long that is . Well , let " s get this over with . ( Snorting ) ( Screeching ) ( Snorting ) ( Thunder of hooves fades ) ( Man ) They got him . ( Woman ) Did they get him ? ( Man ) They got him . ( Woman ) Oh , no . Poor Constable Farnes . - He was one of the best we ever had . - Yeah . I don " t suppose there are ... any volunteers to take Farnes " place ? ( Woman ) Don " t do it . No , no . You may as well save your breath . Nobody in his right mind is gonna accept that badge . L " m afraid you " re right , Dipper . We " ll just have to hope and pray that another drifter passes through Serenity before the next high moon . I sure wish I could go with you , Boomer . I could use a little diversion . I hear you guys spotted some lady types on the settlement ... There were a few ... Muffy wanted to know if they had any other daggits around . We " re going to make that a priority probe as soon as Apollo and I get to the settlement . The energiser seems well secured . Let the younger men worry about the energiser . This is a time for intoxicating scenery , unfiltered air and letting our emotions soar and ... - Ahem . I hate to interrupt ... - No , no , that " s all right . Boomer and I are ready to go . No , I want you to stay here . You " ve spent little enough time with Boxey and me . Let them get on with their mission . I guess you heard him ! Get in the sled and get going . I was hoping we might have had a chance to be alone . Well , we must be very careful not to lose our way of getting off this planet . If anything happened to our ship , that would be the end of everything . You mean we " d have to ... You mean we " d have to spend the rest of our lives on this quaint little planet ? - Oh ! Just the two of us ? - Ah , well ... - ( Engine starts ) - Back before you know it . - See that you are . - Good luck ! ( Muffit barks ) Well , at least we have this time alone . Belloby , please , not in front of the children . Looks like the only place that " s open , Boomer . ( # Barrel organ music from within ) It doesn " t sound like the sort of place one goes to trade an energiser for seed . Well , we gotta start asking questions someplace . Looks like another full moon tonight , Dipper . Don " t look at me . Unless we find a down-on-his-luck prospector or some poor unwitting strangers , we are just out of luck . Boomer , we " re in luck . This is my kind of town . Well , well ... What have we here ? Er , excuse me . They told us you " re the man to see . That depends . - My name " s Bogan . - Starbuck . This is my friend Boomer . We " re looking for someone to talk to about an agron purchase . - You boys farmers ? - Er , yep . Er , my father and I run a forced nitron field in the next quadrant and ... we " ve suffered some reversals . - That right ? - Blight . And we need some fresh seed grain . And we couldn " t help noticing your bins are brimming full . We were hoping for the possibility of a trade-off . That " s an interesting idea . A couple of strong young fellas like you would fit in with our needs . No , we weren " t talking about us . We " re talking about an energiser . - How much power ? - 5,000 kilons . - 5,000 kilons ... - I don " t think that " d fit into our plans . But practically every outpost in this star system is always crying for more power . Really ? That gives you a lot of places to make deals in , huh ? Well , that " s it ? We can " t even talk about it , sir ? Why not take a look at her ? She " s got a clean , steady current . L " m sorry , fellas . L " d like to help you . If you want to discuss staying on , doing a job in exchange for seed ... I " m sorry , we haven " t got time . Our crops are in trouble ! Maybe some other time , then . Right . Thanks anyway . You know we could use that power . We need those two boys even more . - Now we don " t have either one . - Wrong . Now we have both . What will we tell Adama ? What will we tell the people at the fleet when they hear we couldn " t get seed for food ? Hey , what the ... Frack ! Larcenous , golmonging thieves ! - What is this ? - Lousy golmonging thieves ! Frack ! What the ... Lousy golmonging thieves ! You dirty , rotten crasoneys ! Come back here and fight ! Will you cut the felgercarb and give me a hand ? Of all the stupid ... No point talking about it . We got a long walk ahead . - It " s not that far back to town . - Town ? We " ve gotta go tell the Commander . Do that . L " m going to look for the energiser . I have a pretty good idea who sent them . - Bogan . - Uh-huh . Bogan . Why buy the energiser when you can steal it ? - You got it ! - Take care . Well , Dipper , nice work . Here " s 25 quantums for you and for each of your friends . Thank you , Sire . I want you to know that we were very , very careful not to leave any tracks to lead them back here . - Good . - Excuse me . Well , stranger . - Welcome back . - That " s real hospitable talk , Bogan , but somebody here isn " t so neighbourly . You haven " t noticed anybody come in in the last couple of microns ? People come and go around here . What " s your trouble ? - Robbers . - Not in Serenity . Close enough to make it a sure bet it was one of your nice local folk . That " s a serious accusation , young man . L " ll back it up , in time . You " ll have to excuse me . I have a game waiting . Where " s your local law enforcement ? The town constable has ... moved on . - Who " s taking his place ? - The job hasn " t been filled yet . I can tell from your expression what you " re thinking . L " d be careful about taking the law in my own hands without suitable authority . The people ... The people around here stick together and they don " t like people who don " t have a stake in our problems . If you were willing to stay on for just a while , work , fit in ... I have crops to get back to , people to feed ! But you said that your crops were blighted and that you needed seed . Have you got the money to pay for the seed ? I have some currency I got a yahren ago when we sold our last crop . Ah . Well ... Orion checks , Colonial cubits ... You got a bit of everything . Ah ... Yeah , well ... Seed goes for 12 quantums a lexon . - How much you need ? - At least a thousand lexons . And 12 quantums is kinda high . Well , it is a long way to the next agron outpost . Maybe I can get this currency to grow a little . After all , this is a chancery . - Shouldn " t they be back by now ? - I should " ve gone . I scouted the mission . - It was important that you stay . - To protect the camp ? - Yes . - Against what ? - Robbers . - Oh , Boomer ! Thank the Lords of Kobol you " re all right . - Where " s Starbuck ? - He " s fine . - Where " s the seed ? - No seed . - No seed ? - Where " s the powersled ? - It " s gone . - Gone ? - What about the energiser ? - We lost that , too . You lost my energiser ? - We were jumped . - By whom ? It happened so fast . We think it was a bunch from town . Of all the ... Look , lady , I " d like to see you do any better unarmed with a net over you . Boomer , I " m sure you both did whatever you could but now we must get to Starbuck . There " s no telling what he " s up against . Jolly , you stay here , guard the shuttle ... take care of Boxey and let " s take our lasers with us . A three-level pyramid . Cry your hearts out . I ain " t never seen a three-level pyramid . - That does it for me . - Now ... I find it very odd that one person can be so lucky . Another odd thing is how you each had the same amount of currency to lose . You all work together someplace ? All farmer workmen here earn uniform compensation . 25 quantums . That " s good pay for farm work . I told you you might like some employment here . Oh . Looks to me like you " re still a little short of buying that seed . Bogan , maybe you " d care to play with me head to head , as you seem to be the man to beat ? All right , Starbuck . Sounds like a good challenge . ( Grunting ) There it is , Bogan . Put up or give up . I seem to be a little shy here . I ... Tell you what , I " ll challenge . If you agree to accept this as payment . - What " s this ? - A shield made of solid gold . It belonged to a fella who " s gone now . What " s this writing here say ? I ... Yes , the ancient tongue of the people who first colonised this planet . They " ve moved on across the star system . It feels right . Excuse me . A fella can " t be too careful away from home . I wondered how he would get him to accept that badge . You mean , he " s gonna let him win it ? It doesn " t matter how it comes into your possession . Once you accept it , you accept all that goes with it . This is what you get when you send boys to do men " s work . Belloby , please keep your voice down . Those boys know exactly what they " re doing . If you kiss me , I " ll tell you where the powersled is . - What ? - Well ... do you want our people to starve ? Belloby ... if this is some kind of a joke , it " s a bad one . You " re right , Adama . Think of it as a small celebration for finding the energiser . L " m sorry I had to force you to do it . But you know something ? It was worth it . Oh , Belloby ... Bargaining isn " t ... begging . L " m very glad we had this time , too . But that time is running out . Where is the energiser ? - You " re practically standing on it . - Hm ? I found the streaks from the powersled and they led right up to that old shed over there . Belloby ! Well , I ... - I guess this is all mine . - Yes . - Congratulations , Constable . - The name " s Starbuck . Congratulations , Constable Starbuck . I don " t think I ... Who " s in charge here , please ? Sire Bogan . - Sire Bogan ? - That " s right . L " m Squire Adama , Lord of Bellarium . Who " s in charge of law and order ? Ah , well . There he is . You " re looking at him . There " s your man . Constable Starbuck . How do you get into these fixes ? I was trying to find the guys that robbed us . And you expected to find them at a card game . Where else ? My number one suspect was in a card game . I thought I could catch him with his guard down . And what did you get out of it ? A badge you can " t afford to wear , a loss of time and the loss of perhaps innumerable people . Ah . I see you " ve moved in . Excellent . There " s little time . The moon is almost full . Sire Bogan . You appear to be a reasonable man . - I like to think so . - Good . Because we can ill afford to lose even one valuable man . - A mere boy . - I can sympathise with that . - We have the same problem . - Then you " ll let him resign . Can " t do that . It " s against the law . No , Constable is a lifetime appointment . ( Adama ) That " s absurd ! I mean , you don " t even know this boy ! And he was never appointed ! He accepted the badge of office . As for knowing him ... you seem like nice people , you want him back so bad , he " s got to be all right . If Constable is a lifetime commitment , how is it you " re without one ? - Didn " t you say the last one left town ? - I said he departed . I didn " t say to where . Fact is , he died in office . After a lifetime of service to his people . An eminently respectable position . Half the people in town would cherish it . - Half the people in town have had it . - That " s impossible . You " re contradicting yourself . If you can " t resign and half the people have held the office ... - Not the half that " s still alive . - Beg your pardon ? All right , look . You might as well know . We are an endangered species here . Ever since the Borays saw it was easier to steal food than grow their own , we " ve been losing our lives . Why don " t you get rid of the odorous vermin ? ( Scoffing ) That " s easier said than done . We " re not well armed here . If the Borays weren " t herd creatures , who follow their leader Nogow no matter what , we " d all be dead . They follow their leader no matter what ? We leave our food bins unprotected , they head for them and they rob us , unmolested . If any of them get the idea of riding into town for a drink or , shall we say , companionship , our constable stands at the head of the street and he heads them off with a few carefully placed shots . So when the leader turns away , the others follow him . Then one or two Borays ride past him and they grab a couple of our females but ... mostly we just lose a little grain . And , of course , the constable . I ... I don " t feel so well . Don " t you worry now . Don " t you worry . We won " t allow you to jeopardise your life for them . They know perfectly well that they ... they tricked you into this job . My dear sir , I am afraid you don " t understand the situation . You are in as much danger as we are as long as you " re here . And there isn " t much time . - What do you mean by that ? - You know the Borays . When the moon is full , it " s time to eat . Father , come with me . You , too , Constable , since you " re the law in this town . ( Clattering ) Look , Belloby . Get back in the jail . Find a cell and hide in some dark corner . I will not cower on the floor like some infant daggit . Do as you " re told . It " s an order ! We " ll make our stand at the edge of town . ( Snorting and roaring ) ( Thunder of hooves ) ( Apollo ) Here they come . Holy frack , they could shake us to death . Fire in front of them . Now ! - ( Apollo ) They " re still coming ! - Now what ? Take cover ! ( Screeches ) L " m not gonna stand here and let Adama handle them all alone . OK . Aaaah ! Sire Bogan ! Sire Bogan ! Sire Bogan ! - They " ve captured our woman . - Oh , Lord , no . They got Belloby ? You " re not ordinary farmers . There " s only one legendary brigade in the whole universe that could " ve matched the courage I just witnessed . L " m honoured to be in the presence of warriors from the great Colonies . Look , I have to apologise for deceiving you into saving our town but we " re desperate people here . Anyway ... you " re not like us . You know what you have to do and I salute you for it . Any communication from the surface yet ? No , sir . No word as yet . The Commander should have gotten that seed by now . The path that we " ve indicated to you is the only one we know leading into the Boray Canyon . Unfortunately , we can " t describe to you how to find their camp . That " s right . No one " s ever made it back to tell us . - You may need these . - We won " t have any trouble . Come here , Muffy . Come here . Sorry to have to borrow you but we need your tracking sensors . Our prayers go with you . And to the woman you love . ( Clears throat ) Much obliged . They " ve seen their last days . They " ll never be back . Hope they make it , Dipper . They " re brave men . Bogan says the Borays do a lot of carrying on and chanting after a raiding party . That " ll be a help . Muffy , find Belloby . Find Belloby . ( Barks ) We " re being watched . ( Adama ) Yes , I know . We have been for some time now . ( Barks ) Get the torches . ( Barks ) Nogow , their leader , seems to be the key . If we get him to listen to us , the rest might follow him . Yes , he " s the one , all right . If he weren " t so lazy , the Borays wouldn " t be stealing their food . Commander . They let us come this far . Maybe they want to avoid a confrontation . Father . It looks like it " s all over but I " m not going down without a fight . ( Grunting ) You remain here . - Father ... - It " s all right . ( Grunting ) Talk ? ( Grunts ) Adama ? Oh , thank God ! What courage . What love you must have to come and deliver me . Belloby ... Look ... You love your people . I love my people . ( Snorting ) What " s going on in there ? No one " s a better diplomat than your father . If anyone can make them understand , it " s ... That is the most obstinate , self-centred , opportunistic , selfish , lazy creature I " ve ever met in my life . He " s interested in one thing only - his own personal comforts . You can " t bargain with such a creature . - Commander ? - What ? Did you say lazy , self-serving , interested in his own pleasure ? - Exactly . - Could I speak to you , please ? - In private . - All right , make it quick . ( Snorting ) We " ve got nothing to lose . No , we don " t have anything to lose . Starbuck , where ... - Father , what was that all about ? - He " s got a plan . It " s a long shot but it " s the best plan we have . - Commander ? - They " re working up to a charge . Apollo , fire a warning round . ( Grunting ) Belloby ... Let " s get away while the getting is good . ( Muffit barks ) Well , this " ll ... this " ll entitle you to all the fresh planting seed that your ship will hold . We " ll help you load so you can be off . Our people will be very grateful . We have many to feed . L " ll speak to the town committee about altering the charter . That is , pertaining to the job of constable being a lifetime job . - Thank you . - We " ll just keep on hiding and dying . Perhaps not . Is Starbuck back yet ? ( Knocking ) Yo ! Bogan . Commander . Good news . There will be no further raids on your food . The Borays will go back to raising their own just like they used to . Your young man has had too much celebration . No , I ... I " ve worked out a nice arrangement with my buddy Nogow . My dear young , young man , it " s Nogow who " s the heart of our problem . He " s the good-for-nothing leader that " s turned them into scavengers . That " s right . That " s him . You see , what I proposed is a little trade-out . You make sure he gets all the grain and libation he needs , without ever having to lift a finger or mount a steed , and in return he " s willing to ... take over . Take over ? What ? The town , of course ! No ... My job . - Nogow . - ( Grunting ) No , nothing to worry about . L " d like you all to meet Serenity " s new constable , Constable Nogow . Somebody buy him a drink . He doesn " t like to be kept waiting . Right this way , Constable Nogow . I knew someday your poor character would come in handy . If only I were a few yahrens younger . ( Belloby ) And you ! If it were up to that diplomatic bilge you tried , I " d still be in his clutches , which might not have been a bad idea . Listen , I " m sorry , but I " m afraid we " ve grown in different directions . You " re too refined and dignified . I need somebody at my stage of life ... I need a real animal . Come on , boys , I " m buying . Thank the Lord . I just couldn " t see myself calling her Mother . ( Adama ) " Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny , " the last battlestar , Galactica , " leads a ragtag fugitive fleet " on a lonely quest - " a shining planet " known as Earth . " ( Boomer ) " Starbuck crash-landed . A planet on the edge of Omega Sector . " - At least we don " t rust . - Silence . - Kyle ? - My brother . He " s our leader . He " s only a boy and the others were just children . We trade Starbuck to the tin cans for Father . And I just wanted to thank you . We don " t have your father yet but ... you " re welcome . " There are those who believe " that life here " began out there , " far across the universe , " with tribes of humans " who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians " or the Toltecs or the Mayans . " Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man " who even now fight to survive " somewhere beyond the heavens . " Boomer , I just reached a big decision . - You should be the first to know . - Only the two of us out here . See that red star 40 degrees to port ? I gotcha . What " s the big decision ? I was just staring at it and the words of my old flight instructor came back to me . " Starbuck , a viper pilot only flies three vipers - " the one he trains in , the one he escapes from ... ( Sighs ) " and the one he dies in . " ( Bleeping ) Starbuck , the scanner . - ( Boomer ) " They " re on our tail ! " - Let " s show " em our nose . - They " re running . - " Yeah , not for long . " " One in your blind spot ! " - Starbuck , you OK ? - L " ll tell you if you tell me how bad it is . And give it to me straight . No lies . It " s all hanging out to dry . I don " t know how you can transmit . Everything back of your anti-burn baffles is gone . Everything forward isn " t exactly tiptop . L " m trying to find you a place to land . All I can do is fly straight ahead . And I " m not too sure about that . " Afraid my instructor was right . " " Get going before you run out of fuel . " Sticking with me is a bad bet . L " ve got it . A Delta class planet . It " s dead ahead . - " Get going . " - Not till I know you " re down . If I don " t make it , you " ll be the first to know , I promise . L " ll be back with a clean uniform before you know it . L " ll be seeing you . I hope . When you " re finished , move the petro dump inside the moat , under the protection of our outer walls . By your command . Canus Patrol has intercepted two Colonial viper craft . Colonial vipers . Well , well . One viper running . The second is crippled and has penetrated the atmosphere . We are tracking him . Order our patrol to return . - " Canus flight leader , return to base . " - Returning . What if the Colonial warrior evades our patrol ? Lmpossible . ( Chuckling wickedly ) Aah . Attila garrison commander reporting . - Attila ? - An obscure outpost in the Omega Sector . The commander " s name is Specter , I believe . One of the earlier IL series . Before my time . Rather limited in ability . Report , Specter . " We have apprehended a Colonial warrior . " Excellent . Have you interrogated the pilot ? " The scouting party that captured him has not yet returned to our garrison . " I think you know what I desire . " The exact position of the Galactica . " I shall await your next communication . You have a wonderful opportunity here , Specter . - Use it well . - By your command . This Specter seems to have done rather well ... - for an early model . - Hmm ... ( Starbuck ) Aaah ! Hey ! Aaah . Take it easy , would you ? These humanoids are not well constructed . They damage easily . - At least we don " t rust . - Silence . ( Horn sounds ) Aaah . Welcome to Attila , Lieutenant . - You can " t come in here . - It " s important . Stop whispering . L " m not asleep . Now you " ve done it . Good to see you looking better , sir . I don " t look better . I look awful . - But I feel better . - But you won " t for long if you don " t get some sleep . With that doorway guarded like the gateway to Kobol , I presume something important has happened . The recon patrol ? As you felt , the Cylons have penetrated more deeply than we expected . Our patrol was ambushed . - And ? - Starbuck had to crash-land . - But he did land ? - Yes . - Where ? - Attila . It " s a planet on the far edge of Omega Sector . Bad news all around . Recommendation ? Sending a squadron would draw too much attention . - What , then ? A shuttle ? - In and out fast . It better be fast . If it " s not back within 24 centares it " ll never catch up with us . - You and Boomer ? - Yes , sir . ( Grunting with pain ) Please , please , try ... try not to move . You have been hurt . - There were others . - My brothers and sister . - And Cylons . - Don " t worry . We can handle them . Kyle is very , very smart . - Kyle ? - My brother . He " s our leader . Leader ? But he " s only a boy and the others were just children . We are not children . We are warriors . Miri , prepare some food . - The others will soon return from patrol . - Patrol ? Those boys and that little girl out there with Cylons ? - Do you realise what can happen ? - They saw their mother killed , watched the tin cans pillage and invade our castle , slaughter our people . What can happen to them ? They could be killed or captured . We are too swift , our attacks too precise , too well timed , too well planned . - You attack them ? - They are the enemy . They took all we ever had . So now we hurt them . We attack their ammunition depots , fuel dumps and patrols . Yeah . Thanks for that . We fight a common foe . You " re from the Galactica , correct ? You know of the Galactica ? We learned of the Galactica from the Cylons . How far away is she ? - Too far . It " ll be a while before a rescue party can get here for me . L " m afraid you " re stuck with me for a bit . Tin cans are following the tracks I laid ! Corporal , is this the way you report ? A buncha tin cans , sir , following the tracks I ... you ordered me to make in Naga Forest . Very good . At ease . Now , get some nourishment . We " re a little short on discipline at times but you won " t find better warriors . Who taught you ? Your father ? - Father was our leader until ... - Until the Cylons killed him ! Miri , feed the lieutenant . And be quick . We have a mission . Robus , Nilz , Ariadne , go get your tablets . Oh , Miri . We want to talk to the warrior . After you eat and study . That smells good . I didn " t realise I was so hungry . - You " re also their teacher ? - Their education is very important . I always wanted to meet a woman as long on brains as beauty . You think I " m pretty ? Oh , Miri ... Eat ! Miri , when you get back to the Galactica , you " ll have every viper pilot battling over you . - You " ll drive them crazy . - Back to the Galactica ? Yes . You can " t stay here . When the rescue team from the fleet comes for me you " ll come with us . All of us ? Of course , all of you . We have a mission . Boxey . Oh , it " s good to see you . How did you get past the guard ? - I snuck right by her . - You snuck right by her ? You " re the first . You " d better get under the blankets just in case she decides to sneak in , too . L " ve got somebody to talk to . Shall I tell you a story , like you do when I " m in sickbed ? Oh , that would be nice . There once was a shiny planet ... Called Earth . No , called Mushieland . Mushieland ? And it was full of daggits - orange daggits , blue daggits , daggits with horns , daggits with curly tails . The best daggit of them all was Sire Muffy . ( Chuckling ) Sire Muffy ... By your command . The first patrol was eradicated . No . And the Colonial warrior ? Gone . We found signs of humanoid renegades . Our patrol is tracking them . My commander sent me to report . I hope your commander is more efficient than his predecessor . ( Explosion ) Oh , no . ( Explosions ) They will never learn . Did you drop my message for the tin cans to find ? - What " s wrong ? - ( Thunder ) - Kyle , we can " t do this . - It " s the only way to get Father back . - But Kyle ... - You want Father back , don " t you ? - Of course I do . - Then there " s nothing to discuss . We trade Starbuck to the tin cans for Father ... tonight . ( Thunder ) ( Sighs ) Why do you bother , Specter ? L " ll die long before you get anything out of me . L " ve come to tell you that you will be freed , tonight . Freed ? Oh , Lord , no . What does he think he " s doing ? The only intelligent thing he can do . Do you think me a fool , Specter ? Don " t you think I know you " ll never go through with this trade ? What you believe is irrelevant . However , I will go through with it . - Provided you cooperate . - And if I don " t ? ( Thunder ) I vow to slaughter your entire family at the exchange site . - Kyle is much too clever for that . - Is he ? He " s the one who proposed the trade . Your son is getting desperate . Why do you tell me all this ? If you " re gonna do it , just do it . I want your word that once reunited with your family , - you will stop these senseless attacks . - You " d take my word ? I have come to learn that the word of some humanoids can be more binding than Cylon chain . You are such a man . - And the Colonial warrior ? - Not your concern . Do I have your word ? - Excellent . Make the signal . - By your command . I will see that you have clean garments . I would not wish your children distressed by your appearance . ( Thunder ) Well , you " re looking fit , Lieutenant . Whatever Miri put on my leg , it " s working . Thanks , Miri . ( Horses snorting ) Feel up to riding ? Er , yeah , if needed . I heard explosions . Are they tracking you ? Not quite . The Cylons only track us when we want them to . - We are moving to a new camp . - ( Bell ) What was that ? The worship bell in our castle . Kyle , please ! - ( Horn sounds ) - Are you telling them where we are ? Just answering a challenge . We shall be moving anyway . - What if there are Cylon patrols nearby ? - Do not tell me how to command . Well , someone better ! This is no time for heroics . You think because you wear a uniform and fly in a fighter , you should be in charge . Is that it ? Are you afraid I " m trying to take over ? - I fear no such thing . - Kyle ? Kyle , is what he says true ? Ah , so ... he smiles and you choose him . - Him over Father . - Father ? Your father " s dead . Ah . No , he " s captured . Kyle , it won " t work . The Cylons will never make a trade . - You are very bright , Lieutenant . - Hm . I regret doing this but it " s the only chance our father has . He is as good as dead and so are you if you meet with the Cylons ! - Bind him . - Kyle , I don " t think ... That " s an order ! Bind him . Starbuck ... I " m sorry . ( Thunder ) Still no word from Attila ? Specter will contact us if he has anything to report . Perhaps he feels his report will not be received satisfactorily , Baltar . What are you implying , Lucifer ? I have discovered that Specter has ordered more laser pumps and petro than any other garrison . So he " s stockpiling . What commander doesn " t ? He has also ordered an extraordinary supply of laser rifles and metron bombs , certainly unnecessary requisitions for a planet whose entire population has supposedly been terminated . Lucifer , do you wish me to believe that Specter would submit false reports ? Speaking from experience , I would not say it is beyond his programming . ( Cackling wickedly ) Lucifer , I do believe you " re jealous ! Such a reaction is not programmed into IL series circuitry . Commander , Specter reporting . Ah , Specter . You have the coordinates of the Galactica ? " Uh ... - " no . " - Hmm . " The Colonial warrior was injured in the crash . " We are attempting to repair his body " in order to extract the information you need . " I see . How long do you estimate this to take ? " Oh ... " Within five or six centares , he should have sufficiently recovered to torture . " L " m counting on you , Specter . " I know . " And may I say it is a distinct honour to serve the illustrious Baltar ? - " You are a legend to us ... " - Oh , feldercarb . Well ... thank you . " By your command . " You see ? A logical explanation . Yes ... You work on this while we move it . L " ll work on this . You need not worry about an infection . It looks much better . Terrific , I can walk to my execution . Oh , please don " t , Starbuck . - Perhaps they won " t ... - Kill me ? Miri , you saw what the Cylons did here . They haven " t executed Father . They " re probably trying to find your location through him . Or wait for just what happened - a trade . We will continue to attack them . Perhaps we can get you back , too . How ? Trade another human for me ? Huh ? No thanks , Miri . I couldn " t live with that . The raft is ready . It " ll soon be time . Do you really expect the Cylons to make this trade ? I certainly do . I planned it rather well . The tin cans will put Father on a boat and launch him towards us . We will simultaneously launch you towards them . You see , neither side can take advantage of the other . - Wanna bet ? - Kyle , perhaps we are making a mistake . It is a necessary tactical move . We are talking about a human being , of trading him . For our father ! Look , Miri , I know what I " m doing . Have I not led well since Father " s capture ? Yes , but we are not an army . We are a family . Look at them . Go on , look , Kyle . - They " re just children . - Yes , children who need their father . Kyle , I agree with you but this isn " t the way . Megan . You keep your end of the bargain . Kyle . - Miri ! - ( Miri ) lt " s Father . - Children ! - ( Children ) Father ! Kyle , it " s Father ! Kyle , please , just listen to me for a centon , will you ? L " m sorry , Lieutenant , but I have no choice . ( Horn sounds ) That " s the signal . Make the exchange . - Miri , it " s Father ! - Where ? - Over there . - I can " t see him but he " s near . - Which way is he coming ? - Do you see him ? ( Bleeping ) We " ve kept our bargain . Where is the Colonial warrior ? ( Horn sounds ) Launch the raft . - It " s Father . - Father ! Father , look at us . Oh , Kyle ... Starbuck was right . Those little sclime . They deceived me ! Well done , my children ! Well done ! Annihilate them ! Stay down . - What will happen to Father ? - They " ll kill him , won " t they ? No . They kept him alive to stop the raids . This won " t change a thing . - Are you sure , Starbuck ? - Of course I " m sure . - Miri , take the kids . - OK . Go . Starbuck , I almost made a grave tactical error . L " m relinquishing my command , to you . - I accept , on one condition . - Name it . That you continue as my lieutenant . With pleasure . What are your orders ? Well , the first ... the first thing is to get out of here . - And the second ? - To free your father . Let " s go . Anything ? Scanner " s clean . We " ve been lucky so far . How long until we orbit Attila ? Two centares , give or take a centon . We " ll make a low-level approach from the backside . Then I " ll turn it over to you . You know where Starbuck went down . It " s a big planet , Apollo . Boomer ... I know where he went down . ( Sighs ) Looks impenetrable . Our fortress held out the longest when the tin cans invaded . But there were too many . Father and I fought a rearguard action while my brothers and sisters escaped . How " d you get out ? Through the secret passage . Uh ... Secret passage ? I know what you " re thinking but it won " t work . I tried sneaking in that way once , but they " d made the main hall into a command post . There are always two or three score in there . We " d stand no chance . What " s that between the castle wall and the moat ? That " s the petro dump . They moved it closer because of our raids . Lieutenant , I got an idea . Come on . My old flight instructor told me the easiest way to remember a sequence is to sing it . So , one more time . ( All chant ) Through the tunnel , under the land Starbuck and Miri creep hand in hand We swim the moat to the petro dump and blow it up with a great big whump At the bridge the youngest daughter drops tin cans into the water And around the castle the son first-born Rides at a gallop and blows his horn ... ( Horn sounds ) " The first to go is Starbuck and Miri carrying torches to keep things cheery " " Then the brothers swim through the water " To set their bombs for a Cylon slaughter " " Ariadne is ready to throw captured grenades at the bridge below " " We go up the steps to the castle floor " And sneak a peek through the secret door " " Although the dump is double-guarded " We " ll sneak across while the guards are parted " Robus sets one bomb and then the other " Leaving the rest to his older brother " " When all is ready across the moat Kyle will sound the signal note " I apologise for the delay . The captured warrior is still unconscious . - He may even terminate . - Die ? " Unfortunately , we are programmed to destroy humans , not save them . " Our knowledge of their anatomy is so limited . " Still , I do not offer excuses " despite my securing this planet for the Empire in record time . " If this warrior terminates , " I can only view my mission here as a failure . " I will have failed one of the great leaders of our millennium - you , Baltar . " Oh , feldercarb . Now , now , don " t be too hard on yourself , Specter . " My reports tell me you " ve done a brilliant job on Attila . " - Well , we have had our problems . - Problems ? This planet is so wet , half our garrison is down with rust . " But I will spare no effort in saving the human " and extracting the information you need . " By your command . " You actually believe that daggit drivel ? Lucifer , this jealousy is simply not like you . Specter is doing a wonderful job . ( Horn sounds ) Ah , no , not again . - Petro dump is exploding . - I know the petro dump is exploding ! - Dispatch a phalanx of centurions . - By your command . First phalanx , follow me . ( Chanting ) " At the bridge the youngest daughter drops tin cans into the water . " ( Horn sounds ) The phalanx on the bridge . I see , I see ! Centurions ! Stop those ... those despicable renegades . I sure hope this works . I think what you " re doing is wonderful . And I just wanted to thank you . Well , we don " t have your father yet but ... you " re welcome . ( Chanting ) " Through all the confusion , noise and bother " Starbuck and Miri rescue Father . " ( Explosion ) ( Horn sounds ) - Which tower ? - That one . Yes , my children ! My warriors , well done ! Well done ! Megan ! Get down ! Father . Oh , Father ! I hate to break up a family reunion but let " s go . Looks like an entire sector is under attack . Cylons must be taking over . Set her down close . Maybe we can help survivors . I just hope Starbuck " s not in that inferno . The renegades are within the walls . - Inside the garrison ? - Unfortunately . What else can go wrong ? " Any progress ? " Er ... I regret to report the Colonial warrior has ... terminated . - ( Explosions ) - " What was that ? " Er ... We are destroying the last humanoid habitats to assure that no one will ever find refuge on this miserable planet again . " Excellent idea . Scorched planet policy . - " You " re a wonder , Specter . " - Thank you . I have many such ideas and since this environment is so detrimental to our circuits , perhaps you would find use for me and my Centurions elsewhere . " If it " s that destructive to your circuits then , naturally , abandon it . " Report with your unit when you have destroyed the human abodes . " By your command . Yes , I think we are through here . Order all Centurions to the launch field . - Father ! - My warriors . Nilz . They " re gone ! Running , all of them ! ( Gasping for breath ) Lieutenant Kyle reporting that tin cans are fleeing to their transport ship . - The area is secure , sir . - Well done , Lieutenant . Father . You " ve done so well . L " m very proud of you . - Thank you , sir . - You " re a good leader . What hit this place ? An army ? - Apollo . - Boomer ! - Starbuck ! - It " s about time you guys showed up . - Got the clean uniform ? - What ? Clean ? What happened here ? Oh , er , not much . My warriors just wiped out a Cylon garrison . They " re children . No , no . They " re warriors . - Just make it fast , OK ? - OK . Well done , warriors . Couple more yahren and you " ll be giving your big sister competition . You can still come with us . We " ve fought long and hard for this day . Our ancestors originally migrated here from the Colonies but this is our home now . If the Cylons return , we " ll be ready . I don " t doubt it for a centon . You earned this , Lieutenant . - Congratulations . - Thank you , sir . It " s been a pleasure serving you . Ah , yes . Miri . You could " ve broken half the hearts on the Galactica . Including mine . I ... I don " t know how he does it . Neither do I. Starbuck ... We have to go . ( Apollo ) Starbuck ... ( Adama ) " Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny , " the last battlestar , Galactica , " leads a ragtag fugitive fleet " on a lonely quest - " a shining planet " known as Earth . " Maintain silence until we land aboard the Battlestar Pegasus . The Pegasus ? But that " s just not possible . - You " re talking about Starbuck ? - I wasn " t comparing you . But you " ll have to give me time to think . Think of the impression on Gamoray when they learn that I personally led the final assault on the humans . - L " m not getting anything on my scanner . - You won " t . - Then how are we ... - I can feel them , Captain . We must take that base . We must take Gamoray ! That is one opinion , Commander . It does not happen to be mine . - Starbuck ? - I don " t have a thing . - There " s nothing in front of us . - They " re behind us . Behind us ? Oh , swell . How close ? That close ? Apollo ? - It doesn " t look good . L " m going right . - L " ll take left . Good luck , buddy . Dispatching automatic distress to the fleet . Be seeing ya . - L " ll pick him up on the right . - He " s dead on the left . Be back in half a flash . ( Starbuck ) I can " t lose him , Apollo . I can " t shake him . Cease fire . - Cease fire . That " s an order ! - Are you crazy ? Cain " ll have us for dinner if they get away . - They " re human . - What ? I said they " re human . Impossible . We " re the only ones left alive in the entire star system . L " m switching to unicom . Attention . Attention . This is Silver Spar Group Leader , commanding viper pilots to surrender . We are locked on kill . Apollo ... It has to be a trick . This is Apollo , Strike Commander of the Battlestar Galactica . Who are you ? - Bojay ? - I heard him . It " s a trick . They " re all dead . Bojay ? Did he say Bojay ? - ( Starbuck ) Bojay , is that you ? - Starbuck ? Apollo , it is . It " s Bojay ! You remember , he was in our squadron until ... That " s right , until he was transferred to ... the Fifth Fleet . ( Starbuck ) Died in the Battle of Molecay . ( Apollo ) Two yahrens ago . Apollo ... - either they " re not dead or ... - We are . Bojay , if that " s really you , tell us what happened . How did you survive ? Maintain silence until we land aboard the Battlestar Pegasus . Pegasus ? But that " s just not possible . Apollo , do you know whose ship that was ? Cain , the greatest military commander ever . He was my idol . Your idol will order you blasted away if you don " t shut off your transmitters . In case you clowns don " t know , we are in a quadrant controlled by Cylons . Oh , my Lord . It isn " t a dream . And we " re certainly not dead . It is the Pegasus . They won " t shut up . They act as if they " ve seen an apparition . L " m still not sure I haven " t . Alert Commander Cain . " We " re down to the last of it , Commander . L " ve checked every ship . " They " re down to life support now , unless we stop . " Thank you for your report , Jolly . ( Controller ) Frequency intercept scrambled . Running a check on both ID systems ... 186 control on a speed deductor ... Well , that " s just fine . Just fine . We come all this way and simply run out of fuel . - There " s worse . - What does that mean ? - We " re picking up Cylon transmissions . - Good Lord , a Cylon base star ? Lt " s not military . What we " re hearing is civilian . Civilian ? ( Adama ) I just don " t understand it . - We " re a star system away from any ... - I can " t explain it . But somewhere out there , not far away , is a city - a Cylon city . That could be why our recon patrol is overdue . Apollo , Starbuck ? How long before they exhaust their fuel supply ? If they " ve been using their thrusters , they " d be powered down right now . Sir , if we launch a shuttle probe ... We must conserve every drop of fuel to support our life systems . - Bring the fleet to a dead stop , please . - Yes , Commander . - It " s unbelievable , seeing you guys . - How do you think we feel ? We sailed over two yahrens ago to save Molecay . - We haven " t seen a human since . - The rest of the Fifth Fleet ? Destroyed . If Cain hadn " t pulled a brilliant decoy , we " d be gone , too . You must have headed away from the Colonies to be this far out . That was another of Cain " s touches . He knew that they " d be waiting for us from Molecay to the Colonies , so he put us into deep space and we kept going . - We " ve been fighting ever since . - Running . Our skipper doesn " t know the meaning of the word run . - We strike round the clock . - With what ? - Where do you get your fuel and arms ? - From the Cylons , of course . If you officers will excuse our guests , Commander Cain would like to see them in his quarters . Get them a drink , Tolen . They look pale . It " s a very great honour , sir . A very great honour . Yes , I should imagine it is . That " s just a little attempt at humour . L " d quite resigned myself that I would never see another human , other than my own people on the Pegasus , - yet there you are . - The Galactica , sir . Under the flag of Commander Adama , my father . - Adama ? - Yes , sir . Yes , yes . Yes , I see it . Well , how is he ? How is that old modocker ? Considering the load he " s carried since the destruction of our nation ... Yes , I should imagine . And the rest of the fleet ? Only the Galactica survived , sir , along with some 220 ships carrying what " s left of our people . My God . And I thought we had it bad . - Only 220 ships from all the Colonies ? - Yes , sir . Well , my friends , our troubles are over . - How do you mean , sir ? - Tomorrow we go on the offensive . We " ll show those golmonging Cylons how to fight now ! Yes , by the Lords of Kobol , the Cylon Empire is about to fall ! We " re picking up something very odd . - What is it ? - It " s some sort of visual echo . I mean , the Galactica " s image must be bouncing off some ion field . Feed it up to the bridge . ( Tigh ) Omega , have this scan turret checked immediately . Yes , Colonel . Switch to high band . There " s something wrong . It " s a visual echo . It " s the cleanest transmission l " ve ever seen . Nevertheless ... - There " s a signal on fleet comline Alpha . - That " s impossible . Fleet comline is a scramble communicator between warships and since we " re the only battlestar , there " s no possibility of a signal like that existing . " Greetings , Adama , you old wardaggit . " Might " ve known I " d find you and your fleet sitting on your astrums . " Cain ? ! Of all that " s holy . " There " s nothing holy about me , Adama . " Except maybe what I " m doing to those golmonging Cylons . " Lt " s a miracle , Cain . A blessed miracle . " I make my own miracles . " But have it your way . L " ll be aboard in a few centons . " L " ll have some vintage Ambrosa for you . " I should think so . " ( Cheering ) Commander ... It " s impossible . Cain perished along with the Fifth Fleet two yahrens ago . Yes , Colonel , but that " s the fabric of miracles - the impossible . " Commander Cain requesting permission to board the Galactica . " The Lords of Kobol bless you . You have no idea how I feel at this moment . Me too , Adama , me too . I have a present for you . Where are those space loiterers we picked up ? Front and centre ! ( Applause ) Son . I thought I " d seen the last of you . You would have , if my daughter hadn " t cut them off . - They were heading into Gamoray . - The Delphian Empire ? It was . Before the Cylons turned it into their outer capital . It " s now a model of machine efficiency . - That was a society of 50 million beings . - Not any more . When it was clear that the Fifth Fleet was destroyed , I took every survivor I could aboard the Pegasus . I headed straight for Gamoray , their most remote supply base . We " ve been living off them ever since . It " s incredible . If they control Gamoray , they control half the universe . The only thing I " ve been able to do is keep knocking that base down so they can " t get a full strike at me . What I " ve never understood is why they didn " t send out base ships to finish us off . - It " s clear now why they didn " t . - Yes , the Galactica . They were having trouble with a rebel fleet but I couldn " t break the code . I had no idea that there were any other survivors . Oh , nor did we . You " ve given a tremendous lift to all our people . And a death blow to the Cylons . We " re going to take them now , Adama . This is the turning point . No , my old friend , the most we can hope to get from the Cylons is some fuel . - A military victory " s out of the question . - What are you talking about ? L " ve had them on their knees in this quadrant - with just one battlestar . With two - ha ! - L " ll finish them ! - At least on Gamoray . - And then what ? Well , then we " ll have all the fuel we need and a base from which to attack . We can " t secure that planet . And those base ships not bothering you were after me , en masse . No , our only hope is to just keep moving . - You mean run ? - I mean escape . But why ? We can outfly them , we can outfight them , we ... In case you haven " t noticed , I " m protecting 220 civilian ships which crawl along in space at a pace which is perfect for target practice . - There must be some way . - I wish there were . But your knowledge of the Cylon supply lines will be invaluable . - If we could intercept Cylon tankers ... - Why bother with tankers ? Go straight for that fuel base at Gamoray . I can " t leave those ships unprotected while we go off to take some planet . Hades " hole , Adama ! Give me a couple of your best squadrons and I " ll take that fuel base myself . You " ll have enough fuel to go anyplace in the stars . L " ll be satisfied with enough to get us out of this quadrant . Prepare battle plans for capturing those tankers and I " ll approve them . Meanwhile , enjoy a few centons of well-deserved hospitality on the Galactica . Well , if that " s the way you want it . ( Cain ) There " s a certain young lady that I " m most anxious to find . It " s quite unlikely that out of all those people from the Colonies she " d be one of the few survivors , but she always knew how to take care of herself . Well ... what was her name ? Her name is Cassiopeia . " L " ll never forget you , you old wardaggit . " Hurry back . " I can see she has the same effect on you she " s always had on me . And apparently you " ve never seen her before . Speaking of lovely ladies , you met my daughter . " Happy birthday , Father . I love you . " If I " d met that young lady , I " d know it . You met her . She almost flew you right out of your britches . Like father , like daughter . - What are you going to do ? - Find a way to let him down easy . You don " t just jump on a hero . You " re assuming Cassiopeia won " t be as excited as everybody else he " s back . Apollo ... Oh , I forgot . Once they experience the aura of Starbuck ... I never said that . It " s true , but I never said it . Let " s face it , he is an older man . You " re on your own . ( Sighs ) Cassiopeia ? Come in . - Hi . - Hi . Hiya , Starbuck . Is my father back ? Er , yeah , yeah , kid . He is . What " s the matter ? He " s not hurt ? Oh , no . It " s nothing like that . Come on , Muffy . We " re gonna find my dad . Starbuck ... What is it ? Something is wrong , isn " t there ? L " ve ... I " ve got some news for you . It " s ... about an old friend of yours . Someone you may have been involved with or just ... liked . I don " t know which but ... he " s been found - alive . - Who ? - Look , I know it " s over between you but he " s a legend , we " ll have to let him down easy . If you wanna do it , fine . But I " ll be glad to handle it for you if it " s going to be too awkward . - Starbuck , who are we talking about ? - Er , Commander Cain . Cassiopeia ! ( Door bleeping ) Enter . Cassie . L " d almost given up hope . Oh , I missed you so . But I had to stop thinking about you too much . I wouldn " t expect you to , especially with all those young warriors around . They " re all in love with you , I " m sure . No . Only one . - Starbuck . - Starbuck ? He " s a great warrior . Oh , he is , huh ? I wasn " t comparing you . But you " ll have to give me time to think . We may not have much time . I know . Well , how " d she take the news ? Worse than I thought . She ... She wanted to be alone , so ... Starbuck , are you in a little pain ? No . What are you talking about ? Hey , it " s me , Apollo , remember ? We talk about things . Yeah , well , I , er ... I guess I never did like to admit that I form ... - attachments . - You don " t even admit it to yourself . L " ve never understood that about you . You were always part of a very big family . I never had that . So I just grew up keeping the number of people around me as large as I could . So you couldn " t be hurt by any particular one ? Look , I don " t care if Cassiopeia feels something for this Cain . I just don " t understand the combination . I mean he " s , er ... he " s ... - Too old ? - Yeah . Read up on your Book Of The Word . Some of the Elders of Kobol were married to some very young wives . Wives ? Aren " t we getting a little ahead of ourselves here ? She wouldn " t marry him . Anyway ... who cares ? Not me ! Poor Starbuck . Oh , well . He still has Athena and Miriam and Noday and ... Would you stop ? And who told you to listen , anyway ? What about Sheba ? She " s developed into one of our best warriors . She " ll be very unhappy that I " ve returned . Children don " t understand a man " s needs at different times in his life . You came into my life right after her mother died . It may have been difficult for Sheba but if it weren " t for you , I ... Did you ever think maybe Sheba wanted to fill that role ? She " s my daughter . I could be your daughter as well . You could be ... but you aren " t . Our basic strategy has just been to keep knocking down their base on Gamoray . Every time they send one of their leaders in to rededicate that base , we go in and turn it into scrap metal . Oh . Hey , what about you guys ? You " ve got to be raising feldercarb with those tinheads . We do our best . We just shot down a Cylon patrol ship . - Mind if I join you ? - No , by all means . Apollo , Strike Captain Apollo . I believe you " ve spent a lot of time on my tail ? You are Sheba ? Yes , to both questions . You can " t be serious . You shot down one Cylon patrol ship in a secton ? Very serious . When you " re responsible for the lives of civilians crammed onto slow barges , you have to keep a low profile . Sounds like we " re incompatible . We all have to learn to adjust . Even the legendary Commander Cain may have to alter his combat techniques . And who " s going to tell him that ? As a student of your father " s tactics , I think he " ll realise on his own . ( Apollo ) If not ... ( Officer ) Ten-hup ! Sit , sit . Relax everybody , relax . We " re off prime ! This is good . Good , what you " re doing - getting acquainted . Since we " re all going to be fighting together , side by side , - l " m buying the first round . - ( Cheering ) Ambrosa for everyone . For all my warriors ! Come , my sweet Cassiopeia . If you " ll excuse me , I think I " ve had enough combat for now . - Nothing changes . - Everything changes . Not people . Sheba ? Can we talk ? Not now . L " m really not up to it . We " re gonna have to work together if we want to survive . Working with you won " t be the problem . This is the route where the Cylons run their fuel ships . Their convoy has already left Gamoray . But if we use turbos all the way , we can catch them before they leave this quadrant . Turbos all the way . We " ve barely enough fuel to get there and back . - We wouldn " t need any more than that . - Surely the tankers have a fighter escort . In a prolonged battle you " d run out of reserves . I don " t fight prolonged battles with Cylons . They " re not that good . ( Adama ) We " ll send one squadron from each battlestar . No offence but ... I " d prefer to use just my own wings on this manoeuvre . I think for the purpose of morale , it might be best if we started to integrate our squadrons , give them a sense of teamwork . Whatever you say . My warriors will pass on their experience . Let " s get to it . Is there anything he doesn " t do better than the rest ? Lt " s his way of talking . He " s one of the best . L " ve never seen anyone so treated like a ... a god in my life . We must remember that he " s kept his people alive in this Cylon territory for two yahrens . His men would do anything for him . Rightfully so . I hope you know that this adulation , this awe everybody feels for him , - doesn " t alter our feelings about you . - Oh , Apollo . We " re not in a popularity contest , we " re in a struggle for survival . We need heroes that our people can look up to , gather strength from . We need him . - They feel that way about you . - I hope I never disappoint them . Get going . I don " t want the Blue Squadron reaching those tankers after Cain has flown the Colonial flag . There " s a matter of pride involved here . - Yes , sir . - Son ... good luck . Father ? They told me you " re going on the mission . It " s just a routine strike . We can " t afford risking you . We can " t afford not to . L " ll explain later . Transferring control to Silver Spar Squadron . Launch when ready . Strike wing standing by . Blue Squadron ready to rendezvous with Silver Spar Squadron . - Four centons to target . - Doesn " t that sound like Cain ? - Commander Cain . Boomer , isn " t it ? - Yes , but ... I know everyone in my command . Three centons to target . L " m not getting anything on my scanner . - If we " re only ... - They won " t be on your scanner . - Then how ... - I can feel them , Captain . Just ahead is an ionised cloud level . Our target will be hiding there . Split up . I thought we were a single strike force . A dozen escort fighters are ready to jump us . We do this my way . Blue Squadron , head in . Silver Spar , follow me . He " s flying evasive tactics and I don " t see ... I think he knows what he " s doing . We " ll know in a micron . Stand by to penetrate cloud layer . There she is , a Cylon tanker . Two Cylon tankers . I don " t see any sign of ... OK , Blue Squadron , go to work . Don " t hit any of those tankers . There " s an awful lot of them . Jolly , you got one on your tail ! Roll , Jolly . He " s on you ! I can " t seem to lose him ! Let " s go get " em . - Thank you , whoever that was . - My pleasure . ( Cain ) Captain , on your left wing . L " ve got him , Apollo . - Two of " em running . - Blue Squadron . Pursue . That " s all of them . Let " s escort those tankers in . - ( Apollo ) Commander ? - Yes , what is it , Captain ? Were you aiming at a fighter ? I didn " t see him . You didn " t ? He was as clear as the Nubian sun to me . - Where are the two tankers ? - ( Cain ) I don " t know . We " ve come up empty . Let " s regroup and head for home . L " m sorry , Adama , but with all those ships in the air fighting for their lives in and around those tankers , I guess maybe we should " ve sent just my squadrons . We do have a little more experience in hit-and-run tactics . Yes , I suppose it was a mistake mixing forces that never fought together . Commander , with respect , Blue Squadron was nowhere near when the tankers blew up ! Nothing personal , Apollo . You and your squadron handled yourselves as well as I " ve ever seen . It was an honour to have you along and I wouldn " t dream of attacking that Cylon base without you . We " re going against the whole base ? I don " t think we have any choice now . Do we ? Events seem to have left us very few alternatives . L " ll give you my decision in the morning . We can " t wait until morning . We have to work on my battle plan right now . In the morning . - Adama , with all due ... - Dismissed . L " ll be in the Officers " Club when you make up your mind . Sheba . Father , he ... Nothing . Sheba ! L " d like to talk to you . - I was about to join my father ... - That " s OK . Cassiopeia and I will save you a place . Look , I really don " t feel well . - What happened to those tankers ? - They were hit by incidental fire . You " re telling me that someone as good as you are blew the whole purpose of this mission by accident ? - Yes , that " s what I " m saying . - Then we have found witnesses . A toast to our victory over the Cylons ! ( All ) Hail ! Hail ! Hail ! The data from the scanners aboard the Pegasus make it clear that an attack would result in the forfeiture of countless lives . Those are losses unacceptable to me , even if we could board fuel from the Cylon depot . Adama , we have no choice . Your fleet is standing dead in the sky . It " s only a matter of time before their base ships attack . There is a choice . According to my data , the Pegasus is carrying a maximum fuel load . I intend to divide part of that load amongst the fleet . - What ? - Only a sufficient amount to get our people out of this quadrant without loss of life . With any luck , our scanners will be able to locate a secondary fuel source before we run out of it again . Commander , with all due respect , we cannot risk the lives of our people on luck . All the fuel we need is right there at that base - Gamoray . And we have two full battlestars to hit them with . What would happen if we left our fleet of civilian ships unguarded - while we conquered a planet ? - We " d be in and out before they know . We have been dogged by Cylon ships since we left our star system . They strike without warning . They could be massing now . Anything is possible . But I prefer to deal with the probable . The probabilities are with our combined strength we can achieve our first clean victory since we lost the war . L " m not interested in victories . L " m interested in saving lives , what few of them are left . L " m sorry . Colonel , carry out the task of distributing the Pegasus fuel throughout the fleet . Commander . I will not allow that . You have no choice . I think I do . I think two yahrens of surviving the Cylons in this quadrant without any help from you or the Colonies has earned my people , my crew , the right to decide their own destiny . In the same way you decided the destiny of two Cylon tankers ? I did what I thought I had to do to assure the survival of our people . How long do you suppose the fuel from those two tankers would last ? We need enough fuel to sustain this fleet indefinitely . We must take that base . We must take Gamoray ! That is one opinion , Commander . It does not happen to be mine . So I " m going to relieve you of any further responsibility of making decisions contrary to orders . You are relieved of your command . Colonel Tigh , you will assume the bridge of the Pegasus . Father ? I want you to know that we will follow you in whatever you decide to do . Thank you , but you heard the man , I don " t decide anything any more . - Sir , what we meant ... - I know what you meant . But what I did this morning was tactical misjudgement . What you " re thinking of is mutiny . Oh , I may be the most stubborn , egocentric warrior ever in the Colonies but I " m also the best and I won " t be remembered as the one who pulled out and left defenceless civilians at the mercy of those ... tinheaded golmonging Cylons . By your command . - Speak . - We " ve found the Colonial trailing ships . They turned back before discovery , I presume . By your order . Very well done . This is the final moment . At long last I " ve overtaken Adama with sufficient strength to blow him out of the sky . - It should be quite a good battle . - It will be no battle at all . A single battlestar is no match for three base ships . Oh , no , what we have here , my dear Lucifer , is what is known as a rout , a humiliation , a massacre . Then you do not wish support fighters from Gamoray , our outer capital ? The only thing I want from Gamoray is a welcoming parade , a victory celebration , a tribute from the people of Gamoray for the greatest military leader Cylon has ever known . L " ve decided that the city of Gamoray will be my seat of power . From it , I will decide how and where I will extend my dominion throughout the star system . Begging your pardon , Baltar , but shouldn " t we first go through the formality of conquering the humans before ordering our victory celebration ? That had the note of sarcasm , Lucifer . Watch yourself . You " re not the only IL-series Cylon who dreams of standing beside the greatest conqueror in the universe . - Forgive my impudence . - Hm . - About that launch order ... - Yes , yes , let " s get on with it . Wait . Wait , I have an even better idea . I will accompany the strike force . - You , go into ... - Yes , yes . Think of the impression on Gamoray when they learn that I personally led the final assault on the humans . Prepare a ship with two of your best pilots . By your command . " Captain Apollo requesting permission to board the Pegasus . " Colonel , fuelling shuttles are starting to come aboard . Proceed with fuel distribution to all ships in the fleet . Yes . There " s bad feeling festering aboard this ship . Shouldn " t we delay this order until things settle down ? Commander Adama wants the fleet able to get underway quickly . We can " t do that without fuel . Now , carry out the order . - Can we be of some help ? - Only in the transfer of fuel . - What transfer is that ? - We have a job to do . Stand aside . - What are you doing ? - Fighting for our commander . - And our lives . - He accepted the order . Why don " t you show the same good sense ? Look , Captain , maybe you don " t understand the situation . Adama humiliated the greatest man that ever lived , who can think and fight circles around your father . She " s right , Apollo . He saved us from certain death . Now it " s our turn to help him . No one wants to see Cain hurt or disgraced . - Isn " t it a bit late to say that ? - Commander Adama had no choice . There can only be one leader . And we " ve got the wrong one . That " s why you " re not taking our fuel . L " m only going to say this one more time . Adama is the fleet commander , he " s determined that we don " t send our defences off to a Cylon capital while our fleet sits here helpless ! I support that thinking , so stand aside ! Well , now , what " s it gonna be ? - ( Alarm ) - Just what Adama was afraid of . We " re under attack . Back to the ship . Large Cylon task force coming in . - ( Woman ) 50 microns and closing . - Get me the Galactica . Sir , 45 microns and closing . That " s the largest force I " ve seen since the destruction of Caprica . - What is it ? What have they got ? - We " re not certain . But from the number of bombers , they have three base ships moving in . You were right , I was wrong . The fleet would " ve been defenceless if we had attacked . Right now I need you and your tactical wizardry . They used only three ships to wipe out our fleet at Caprica . Surprise was on their side then . This time , it might be on our side . Pull out the Pegasus . Exactly . It " s on the far side of our fleet . I doubt if it " s on their scanners yet . L " ll bring it around and squeeze them in-between us . Don " t take too long to be in position . If it " s OK to burn up half my fuel , I " ll bring it up to light speed . - Do I have a choice ? - No . - Be there when we need you . - L " ll be there . Commander , 25 microns and closing . Arm weapons . Stand by to attack . This is going to be a classic defeat , spoken of throughout the star system for 1,000 yahrens . Launch fighters . Incoming communication from Commander Cain , sir . Put it on the line . L " m resuming command of the Pegasus . So I " ve been informed by Commander Adama . Good . Get that ship out of there . Swing on a 180 and follow course 1-1-0 . L " ll rendezvous with you . - What about the attack force ? - Let me worry about that . Have pilots launch-ready . L " ll be aboard soon . ( Cheering ) Lt " s nothing personal , sir . It " s just that ... I quite understand . Who can fight a living legend ? ( Baltar ) Goodbye , Galactica . Goodbye , Adama . You " re finished . Positive shield , now . ( Adama ) Commence fire . ( Pilot ) Let " s go get " em . This time , the Galactica hasn " t a chance . ( Baltar ) Concentrate our fighters on the landing bays . Her warriors won " t be able to refuel , reload or land . - Fire in the bay . - Damage report . It " s out of control . Alpha Bay is completely cut off . Keep leading her warriors away from the main fleet . They can " t stay aloft using full battle thrusters for long . ( Cylon ) A word of caution . We too , are expending great amounts of fuel in a sustained attack . Yes , but we have a place to land . They do not . Or will not before long . We are running parallel to the Cylons on their rear flank . The Galactica is reporting heavy damage to her landing bays . Bring her around 60 degrees . We " re going in . Burn , Galactica . ( Baltar ) You " re finished , Adama ! ( Cylon ) Sir , if I may ... I don " t want to miss a moment of the last battlestar " s destruction . ( Cylon ) I really think you should look at the other battlestar . What are you babbling about ? - It " s impossible . - No , it is a battlestar . Turn , you fool ! Turn ! He " s coming right for us !

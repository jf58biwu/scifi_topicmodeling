 25.000 Attitude stable , trajectory firm . Systems check . We have full function on all navigational systems . Confirmed . We have full function on all communication systems . Confirmed . Power status ? Full function , course is set , we have a clear on Mars beacon . We have a go confirmation on all systems , sir . Thank you , Mr Raiker . Set hyper drive speed , Time Distort 5 . Time Distort 5 . 5 and running . Lock in full auto . I thought maintenance was supposed to have fixed that high D shift vibration . That 's what they said . That 's what they always say . They don 't bother . Nobody bothers anymore . You 'd better identify us to Space Security . Yes , sir . This is Civil Administration ship London . We are in transit from Earth to Cygnus Alpha , transporting prisoners to the penal colony . We have Federation clearance for direct flight , authority number K 701 . Transmission ends . Still studying for your Commander 's credentials , Artix ? Yes , sir . I don 't want to spend the rest of my life on old tubs like , I ... I mean ... I know what you mean . I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm going to my quarters . Anything I should know ? There 's a report of some meteorite activity about 18 hours ahead ship time . Space Met say it should have cleared our course well before we reach it . Well , keep an eye on it anyway . And Mr Raiker ? Give the prisoners the usual pep talk , and assign them their duties . My pleasure . Use the highest level of suppressants in the prisoners ' rations I like ' em docile . Yes , sir . Err , Mr Raiker ? Sir ? There 's a female prisoner on our manifest . I 've noticed that , sir . Yes , well err , be discreet . Yes , sir . During this period , you will obey every order and instruction that is given to you . There is a punishment scale for infractions , which starts with long periods of confinement in your launch seat . and ends with the Commander 's right to order execution . If you have any complaints , I don 't want to hear them . Understand this clearly : You have no rights whatsoever . None . Questions ? Open it up . This is the limit of your world from now on . It has mess facilities , sleeping bays , recreation area . Sort out amongst yourselves how you use it . There are other rules . You 'll find out what they are when you break them . That 's all . Clear your harnesses , you 're at liberty to move . What have we here ? Not a troublemaker , I hope ? I didn 't hear an order . You didn 't hear an order , sir . SAY IT ! I didn 't hear an order , sir . That 's better . What 's your name ? Blake . So you 're Blake ? Made quite a name for yourself a few years back . Quite the celebrity . Something of a comedown for a leader of men , isn 't it ? Molesting kids ? The charges were false . Oh yes , of course . Well , let me tell you something Blake . To me , you 're just another piece of cargo . Remember that and you might just survive the journey . Do you understand ? I understand , sir . Good . You 're learning . Let him clear . Do you think this is a good time for me to tell them I suffer from flight sickness ? I don 't think they 'll be very sympathetic . I expect they 'll find a cure for it , though . A permanent one probably . They amputate your head ! Come with me . Here goes . What 's your name ? Jenna Stannis . Unfortunately , Jenna , there are no special facilities for female prisoners . But if you should find things difficult , I might be able to arrange something more comfortable . That 's very considerate of you . Why make it hard on yourself ? Why indeed ? [ SHARP SLAP ] You 'll come round ! I can be VERY persuasive ! That one 's going to enjoy giving us a hard time . And you 've improved his mood no end . Why couldn 't you be nice to him ? - He 's not my type ! - You can 't afford to be choosy now . Why else would I be talking to you ? - Thanks . - Pleasure . - What 've you got there ? - Nothing . Do you know how those door panels work ? No , not that type . It 's simple enough . All authorised personnel have their palm prints filed in the computer . The blue sensor plate reads the print . If it conforms , the computer opens the door . Neat . Most computer based functions are . Blake , Kerr Avon When it comes to computers , he 's the number 2 man in all the Federated worlds . Who 's number 1 ? The guy who caught him . You 've got nothing to be ashamed of . D 'you know , he came close to stealing 5 million credits out of the Federation Banking System . What went wrong ? I relied on other people . Why all the questions ? Or is it merely a thirst for knowledge ? Not exactly . Having defined the problem , the first step is the acquisition of data . Define the problem then . How to avoid spending the rest of our lives on Cygnus Alpha . That may not be a problem . I 've heard a rumour that these ships don 't go all the way to Cygnus . Once they 're in deep space , they quietly dump you out of an airlock . You 're a fool . They are on a fixed price contract . They get paid the same whether we get there or not . And hyper drive running is expensive . So they dump us and save themselves a trip . Could it be altered ? What ? The running log . Could the readings be faked ? Only by a top line technician . Nobody on this ship could do it . Except you ? Naturally . Was it wise to put that idea into his head ? What idea ? Oh , he 's bright . He 'd already thought of it . What ? He fixes the log , the crew dump us , pocket the profit , and set him free . That 's immoral . The cold hearted murdering ... Let 's kill him now before he can do it . How much do you know about this type of ship ? Not a lot . Converted deep space freighter . Early mark hyperdrive which needs re-stressing by the feel of things . Whole lot should have been scrapped ages ago . - Could you pilot it ? - I expect so . Why ? Once we 've taken this ship , we 'll need a pilot . There shouldn 't be anything there at all . It 's empty space . Nothing orbits through it , no marked space wrecks , no navigational hazards , nothing . Well , there 's something there now , and our course takes us right through it . What 's happening ? Full spectrum shock waves . The last one was only scale 2 . What was the reading on that one ? Seven . Put all sections on standby , turbulence alert . - All sections on standby , turbulence alert . - Put out the deflector shields , there 's some debris too . Deflectors out Where 's the blast coming from ? Somewhere in that top right hand sector . That 's total void ! Not now , it isn 't . Show him . I 've never seen anything like that before . Can you increase magnification ? We 're at the limit now . What sort of range ? We 're about 5 subsecs on the high D grid . Anything coming in on the communicators ? No , static right across the range . It could be some sort of meteorite collision . [ EXPLOSION STATIC ] What the hell was that ? ! I think it 's a damn great space battle . Two fleets , maybe more We haven 't got any heavy combat stuff in this section , have we ? Well , they 're not Federation ships , and that 's not our battle . I want a new course . Take us round it , with a 3 subsec margin from the outer limits of the action . - Reading ? - Scale 9 ! Shift course now , and we 'll take those blasts broadside ! They 'll smash the guts out of us ! Better that than run into the middle of a war . Manual control , Mister Raiker . Put the ship on full emergency , all crew to operational stations . Full emergency , full emergency . All crew to operational stations . [ BOOMING EXPLOSIONS ] Keep an eye on me as well , will you ? Hey , Klein , got a little trick to show you . Have you ? Now watch very , very closely , right ? Right ? Now watch carefully . And a one . And a two . Watch closely now . I got past both metal grilles this time . It 'll work if only I can get him to do it . He 's through there . If you had access to the computer , could you open the doors ? Of course . Why ? Just wondered how good you really were . Don 't try and manipulate me , Blake . - Now why should I try and do that ? - You need my help . Only if you can open the doors . I could open every door ; blind all the scanners , knock out the security overrides , and control the computer . Control the computer and you control the ship . Then I do need your help . There 's a service channel , runs the whole length of the ship . Every other compartment has an inspection hatch . The last one opens onto the computer section . Give me one good reason why I should help you . You 're a civilised man , Avon . On Cygnus Alpha that will not be a survival characteristic . An intelligent man can adapt . Or recognise an alternative . I already have one . A deal with the crew to fake the running log ? You 've had 4 months to think about that . And it didn 't take you that long to work out they 'd have to kill you afterwards to keep you quiet . Whereas you are offering me safety ? I 'm offering you the chance of freedom . Generous , considering mine will be the most important job . You 'll do it then . When ? Now . [ INCREASING WHIINE ] [ EXPLOSION OUTSIDE SHIP ] Damage report ! All sections report damage , all sections report damage . Section 2 . Port deflector shields buckled , sir . Section 4 . The outer hull has been punctured astern . - Auto repair circuits ? - They 're sealing it . Mr Artix ? Vision panels have cut out but I 'm getting blind readings , and an echo from something big and pretty far off . I can 't identify it without a scan . Could it be a ship from the battle fleet ? It 's a long way out from the centre of the action , seems to be drifting . It 's my guess that it 's being pushed along in the shock waves . It 's running parallel to us . Keep a check on it . And start working on those vision panels . Here we go again . [ EXTERNAL EXPLOSIONS ] A couple more like that and we won 't have a ship to take over . Call in Vila . And Gan and Nova ? Are there any others ? The rest are doped to the eyeballs . Do you think we should get on with it , maybe ? Maybe ? Don 't be nervous , Vila . Nervous ? I 'm not nervous . Just poised for action , that 's all . You 've got an army of five , Blake Five and HIM ! Do you still think you can take over the ship ? If you do your bit . What 's that ? Sealing gel . If the outer hull gets punctured , this floods into the section and blocks it up . It goes solid in seconds . We must have been holed in that last turbulence . - Gan , what about waiting . - No ! These blast waves are our best chance . The crew have their hands full just running the ship . - Are you ready ? - Yes . Make it good Vila . Gan . We 'll be ready in exactly 15 minutes . Will that give you enough time ? Knock out those scanners and open the doors . We 'll do the rest . Good luck . Luck has nothing to do with it . - You look as if you could do with a drink . - I 'm always thirsty , Vila Now I want to show you a little trick here . Right , Gan You know this one . - Now , I 'll watch carefully this time . - Now watch the cloth carefully . And a one . Never works first time . And a two . One more chance for you , right ? Are you watching carefully now ? Yeah , right . One. two. three . - Now , that 's better . - Not bad , is it , eh ? One for you . How will we know when he 's made it ? The light on the scanner . when that goes off we 're on our way . He should have made it by now . You think he 's been caught ? No , there would have been an alarm . I 'd better get in after him . You can 't . If it all starts happening while you 're in there , who 's going to get this lot moving ? He 's right . All right , you go then . Me ? I 've got this problem with confined spaces . There 's a medical name for it . Cowardice ? I 'll go . Well , let me do it . I haven 't done anything yet . I 'm quite prepared to go , I just don 't want to let anyone down because of my , uh , complaint . I want to help . What do you think ? All right , let 's get him in there . Gan , let 's try it with this one . Here it comes again . Hang on . [ INCREASING WHINE ] [ EXTERNAL EXPLOSIONS ] [ HISSING AIR ESCAPING ] Help . - Damage ? - Three hull punctures , sir . All sealed and solid . OK . Carry on . What was the force ? Down to 9 again . It 's reducing . Not before time . Where 's that echo ? It 's practically on top of us ! We 're on a collision course ! Get those scans fixed ! Come on ! Move it ! Prison compartments scanners . [ ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE ] Off . Here we go . Ready ? Come on , Avon . He 's spotted it ! Gan ! Oh , come on , Avon . The door . Come on . Bring the guard . Open the door . Put his hand on the door . Look , we only need the hand . If you want to stay attached to it , do as you 're told . All checks complete , the fault must be in the computer . Get down there , Mr Raiker . Spread out and find the armoury . Jenna ? What ? Let 's find the computer room . All the doors are open ! Well , perhaps that last shock wave did more damage than we thought ! It looks like the whole system 's been disrupted ! Let 's find out . Blake ! Watch out ! [ GUNFIRE ] [ GUNFIRE ] Blake ! Now ! [ GUNFIRE ] Close the door ! Come on ! Quickly ! Get up to the flight deck ! Tell the old man what 's happening ! [ ALARM ] Now what ? Cripple the ship ! We 've got all the bargaining power we need . Use it ! Excuse me ! [ ALARM DIES ] What the hell 's going on ? The prisoners have escaped and got hold of the computer . What ? Come on ! " Find the armoury , " he says . I don 't even like guns . Grab the guns ! Stay right there , or we 'll kill them . Drop your guns ! [ GUNFIRE ] Move and you 're dead ! Vila ! I got confused . Hands on your heads . Now move . Single file . They 're still in there ? Yes , sir . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] This is Commander Leylan . Surrender immediately and you 'll be treated leniently . If not , my men will blast their way in and you 'll suffer the consequences . Those are your terms ? Yes . These are mine . Hand over all your weapons to my men . Without the computer , the ship is helpless . It will remain that way until you agree . You will then fly this ship to the nearest habitable planet where the prisoners will disembark . Any attempt by your men to break into this room and we 'll destroy the computer . Totally . That 's all . Blake , listen to me very carefully . There 's something large , travelling very near us , and we 're running blind . We may be on a collision course . You 're putting everybody 's life at risk ! Better make up your mind quickly then . [ GUNFIRE ] Dainer ! Sir ? He wasn 't armed . We were lucky they didn 't find the armoury . We 've got most of them back to their quarters . We 're just mopping up now . So I see , Dainer . Some of our men have been injured , sir . And the prisoners ? - We 've killed six . - Six ? Seven . In the course of quelling a riot and protecting the ship , sir . - Very well . Carry on , Dainer . - Thank you , sir . I can get them out of there , sir . How ? I want a free hand to take whatever action I think necessary . Do I have your permission , sir ? All right . Come on ! What do you think they 'll do ? - Their time 's running out . - So 's ours . We have less to lose . You may have , but I value my life ! Assuming they do land us somewhere , what then ? Find a way of getting back to Earth . Back to Earth ? That 's where the heart of the Federation is I intend to see that heart torn out . I thought you were probably insane . That 's possible ! They butchered my family , my friends . They murdered my past and gave me tranquilised dreams ! At least you 're still alive . No ! Not until free men can think and speak . Not until power is back with the honest man . Have you ever met an honest man ? Perhaps . Listen ! Wealth is the only reality . And the only way to obtain wealth is to take it away from somebody else . Wake up , Blake ! You may not be tranquilised any longer , but you 're still dreaming . Maybe some dreams are worth having . You don 't really believe that ? No , but I 'd like to . You asked me what I was going to do and I 've told you . What you do is up to yourselves . A new identity . A job in the Federation Banking System . Three months with their computers , I could lift 100 million credits and nobody would know . Then let anyone try and touch me . And the rest ? Have the same chance as I have . You don 't really believe that ? [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Blake ? Switch on your vision panel . Scanner 34 . There 's something I want you to see . You have a clear view of our little assembly , Blake ? We see you . Then lock off the scanner and keep watching [ GUNFIRE ] I 'm going to kill one of your friends every 30 seconds starting now . I 'll stop when you give yourselves up , or I run out of prisoners . Raiker ! Listen to me ! Raiker , damn you , those men are unarmed ! The talking 's over , Blake . Let me talk to Leylan ! Raiker ! Raiker ! [ GUNFIRE ] Open the door . You 're throwing away our only chance . Open the door ! Hands on your heads . Stand where you are . Raiker 's switched off . Tell him we 're coming out And quickly ! [ GUNFIRE ] Move it . Commander , your first officer is guilty of murder . I demand that this incident is fully reported . Now don 't tell me how to run my ship , Blake . Everything that happens here is logged and filed with the Flight Authority . and they 'll take whatever action they deem necessary . You could have won , Blake . All you needed was guts . I 'll settle for yours ! Take him back . Put them in close confinement . The girl and I have some unfinished business . Or did you think I 'd forgotten ? Mister Raiker ! Have you gone completely mad ? Put her with the others . Mr Artix , get a technical squad in there . I want that computer fully functional in 10 minutes . Yes , sir . Mr Raiker ! This time you went too far . There 'll be an official inquiry . Naturally , Sir And I 'm sure you 'll confirm that I was acting with your full authority . There were other officers present who heard you give me permission to do what was necessary . Everything that was said or done by everybody , including me , will be in my report . How do you feel ? Sick . So you should . What a fiasco . You could take over the ship , you said , if I did my bit . Well , I did my bit , and what happened ? Your troops bumble around looking for someone to surrender to , and when they succeed , you follow suit . What do you think they 'll do to us ? Something unfriendly . For a while , I really thought we 'd made it . It was my fault . We know . I 'll try and do better next time . We had one chance . You wasted it . There won 't be a next time . In which case , you can die content . Content ? Knowing you were right . - We have power back , sir . - About time . We have normal functions on all systems . They 're phasing them in now . - Have we got scan yet ? - Not yet . Get me a blind reading on that echo . It 's very close . These readings have got to be wrong ! - We 've got the scan back . - Right , get me a picture . I don 't believe it ! - Take us in as close as you can , Mr Raiker . - Yes , sir . Where could it have come from ? I 've never seen a ship like that before in my life . - She 's drifting , Mr Raiker . Maintain this distance . - Right , sir Try and make contact , Mr Artix ; sound and vision . This is Civil Administration ship London out of Earth bound for Cygnus Alpha . Please identify yourself . [ STATIC ] I reckon she was involved in that space battle we picked up . She got caught in the big blast and the crew were either killed or got out in the life rockets . It 's possible . No visible sign of damage , though . No sign of life either . Well , if she 's been completely abandoned . We could put on a boarding party . You know how much that ship would be worth if we could get her to a Federation planet ? Millions of credits . Millions ! Leave a skeleton crew on it . We could do that . It 's got to be worth a try ! Yes it has . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Section 4 ? Stand by to run out a transfer tube . Wallace and Teague ? Sir ? Kit out with your survival units . I 'll be with you in a minute . Take us in as close as you can and keep us there . Yes , sir . Good . - Transfer tube ready , sir . - All right . Begin extension . [ MECHANICAL DRONING ] Locked on , sir . Air pressure established . Keep your communicators open at all times . I want a full report of conditions inside that ship . If there is anyone alive over there , make peaceful contact . Weapons are only to be used as defense . Understood ? - .Sir. - .All right , in you go . All right , open airlock . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Starting along the transfer tube now , sir . We 're against the hull . It 's a hatch entrance . I 'm about to operate the remote lock activator . No response circuit 1 . No response circuit 2 . No response circuit 3 . No ! Wait ! It 's opening There 's a powerful light source from somewhere . We 're going in now . Krell ? Get kitted up and standby to give backup if it 's needed . Yes , sir . We 're in some sort of a cylinder . An airlock , I think It 's turning . It 's fantastic , sir . I don 't believe it ! What is it ? What 's happening ? We 've come out into some sort of flight deck , but it 's like nothing I 've ever seen before . Describe it later . Give me life support readout . Pressure normal ; minimal radiation breathable atmosphere . Good . Is there anybody on board ? Not that we 've seen so far , but I 'm sorry ? What was that ? I didn 't speak . Somebody did ; somebody said something a ... [ BURST OFSTATIC ] Teague , report ! Wallace ! Where the hell is that backup man ? Ready , sir . Right . Get across there as fast as you can . Right . Open airlock . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Raiker . Let Artix take the ship Get down here . Right , sir . I 'm in the airlock and it 's turning . I 'm inside . The design is strange to me . All the flight control positions are empty ! All right . Don 't move . Just look around and tell me what you see . What ? I heard something . What is it ? It 's whispering . Ssshh . Yes . Yes . I hear you . Davor ? What are you ? What are they doing to you ? No . No ! Krell ! Krell ! Answer me ! Krell ! Now listen to me Krell if I have no signal from you within 3 minutes , I 'm withdrawing the transfer tube . 3 minutes ! Wait ! We can 't give up that easily . That ship 's worth a fortune . Looks like I 've already lost three men . I 'm not risking any more of my crew . Then use prisoners ! They 've got nothing to lose . Use Blake and the other two . Let them take the risks . Why not ? We might save the other three . Right . At least we 'll have tried . Right . Get them equipped and bring ' em down here . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Leylan . I 'm picking up a focused energy field close by . I presume its the other ship ? Is it constant ? There 've been two violent discharges , but after each the source dropped back to constant . Thank you , Mr Artix . I hope Mr Raiker 's made it clear to you that you can refuse to do this . Oh yes . He 's also made it clear that summary executions one of our options . We chose the other . Well , if you 're successful , I promise that I 'll get your sentences quashed . And if we 're not ? Then you 'll have no more problems anyway . What is it that we have to do ? Find out what 's happened to my men and see if it 's safe to send a boarding party across . All right . I 've had worse offers . Good . Do we get weapons ? I 'll toss them into the airlock once you 're inside . Very wise . All right , open the hatch . Open hatch . [ GROWLING AND SNARLING ] Get him out of here ! What do you suppose did that to him ? That 's what we 're supposed to find out . Execution may have some appeal after all . Let 's go . Right . Open it up . It 's beautiful . Look at that instrumentation . A ship like this could go anywhere ! This one is dead also . [ INCREASING HUM ] What is it ? I don 't know . [ HUM INCREASES IN INTENSITY ] You 're dead . Those tapes are forgeries . You 're dead ! No , no . Get back ! I must go to him . [ GUNFIRE ] - What was it ? - I don 't know . I saw my mother . It was so real . Then something terrible . But it was my mother . I saw my brother . It used him like bait . I had to go closer . And if you had , it would have killed you . That thing took an image out of your minds and then projected it back at you . But why didn 't it affect you ? It did , but somehow I knew it wasn 't real . Seems I can recognise dreams . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Blake . Are you all right ? Yes ! We 're all right . But we 're still checking . Stay in contact , Blake . Get me a survival unit . What 're you going to do ? They 're still alive I 'm going to make sure they don 't get any ideas about staying over there . Raiker ! Yes , sir . Blake ! This would account for what happened to the crew . What is it ? Life rocket launch control it 's been operated . But why ? Maybe that thing drove them out . I imagined it was some kind of defence mechanism . Could this ship operate under her own power ? I don 't see why not . But could you pilot her ? Eventually I might just be able to make her start and stop . You 've got two minutes , no more . Help her , Avon . What are you going to do ? Check the outer hatch in case someone decides to try and join us . I want a boarding crew kitted out and ready to follow me over . [ GUNFIRE ] [ GUNFIRE ] Shall we risk it ? Why not ? [ ELECTRONIC WHIRRING ] [ ENGINE HUM ] What happened ? Slight disagreement with Raiker . And then the hatch closed . We 're on our way . What course have you set ? Name it . We 're free . We 've got a ship . We can go anywhere we like . Follow the London to Cygnus Alpha . Then we can free the rest of the prisoners . With a ship like this and a full crew , then we CAN start fighting back .

 Say I was right . Admit that I , Jack Tanner , did foretell , did prophesy , long before you heard from that eyeless instrument . Yes , Jack . You were absolutely right . But tell me - and tell me sensibly - how you knew , how even you could foretell that a heavenly body the size of Earth 's moon is approaching our planet . Not any moon ! THE Earth moon ! That self-same orb whose unforgiving eye beheld the birth of Caesar . - And no doubt your own . - Jack . When it came to the crunch , did Caesar believe the soothsayer ? By heaven , Jack . You ARE right . That is our moon . The Earth moon . Yeah , a bit eaten but still a gift wrapped in enigma . Jack . There may be people out there , on Moonbase Alpha . - Earthmen from home . - But mortal ! With we of the eternal breed , there can be no contact . Hello out there ! Hello , Alpha . 'This is Ultima Thule . Do you copy ? 'Men of Alpha , do you hear me ? 'We have a life here , a long life , that you could share . ' 'A long lane and no turning ... ' 'Ultima Thule is a lost paradise . Come ! ' 'Lost ! And with no final end ! ' 'The smog is creeping in . We can talk no more , but come ! ' 'Stay away ! Stay away ! ' - Solid cotton wool . - The man said smog . Let 's see if Communications is still choked . Paul ? - ' Commander ? ' - Still no contact ? 'We 're transmitting but getting nothing back . 'The surface weather is terrible . ' If we head into the smog , we may lose contact . - Keep listening . - ' All the time . ' Hey , this can 't be too good for our on-board instruments , either . - Victor . - John ? 'We may need our on-board computer to land near the radio signal . ' Has the smog affected our instruments ? Sensors are out but we 've got the original data . The last surface temperature was minus 60 . 'And that 's the heat of the day . ' Some paradise , huh ? Whoa . Nice touchdown , Computer . Could have been rougher . Depending on how hard the going is , about 20 minutes due west ought to bring us to the signal source . I suggest we stay close together , but if you get lost , the comlock locator beam should bring us back to the ship . All set ? Be quiet , Jack ! I am the dog that bays the moon who sets her cats amongst your pigeons . - Another prophecy ? - Merely an inclination of my ear in the right direction . You cannot hear for listening . They 've come . They 've come ! You didn 't think they 'd heed a fool . Alphans . Alphans ! 'Go home ! Alphans go home ! ' A voice ! I heard it ! - Must be the wind , John . - No , Helena , I heard it . I heard it ! John , we 've arrived ! This is the place those signals came from . How can men survive in a place like this ? Where 's Alan ? Alan ! - He was just here . - No , Victor . Alan ! Carter ! Commander ! - I just took a look around . - Don 't ! - ' Men of Alpha , do you hear me ? ' - Yes , we hear you . - Where are you ? - ' Men of Alpha ... ' Good to know there 's somebody around . We 're not gonna find them . I say we go back to the ship and let them find us . Amen to that . Helena ! Helena ! - Alan ! - Helena ! John ! Victor ! Where are you ? They 've got the beam , John . They can follow that . In these conditions ? Victor , grab hold of my belt . Where are you ? John ! - Let 's get some rest . - No . Victor , get up ! We should have reached the ship long before this . - Get up , Victor ! - This beam 's leading us in circles . - We can 't stop , Victor . Come on ! - No , I gotta ... I gotta sleep . - I gotta sleep . - Sleep will kill you . You 'll freeze ! Come on ! Get up ! Get up ! No , sleep . No , sleep ... John , it 's Helena . Can you hear me ? I don 't know what I 'm doing . I 'm not ... behaving like a doctor , I 'm ... I 'm sitting down . But it 's all right . I don 't feel the cold any more . I ... I 'm getting so sleepy . ♪ Smile , smile , smile ♪ As long as you 've a lucifer ... ♪ Second stanza . ♪ Lucifer to light your fag ... ♪ Helena , get up ! Get up ! Helena ... Let 's go . Come on . Helloooo ! Helloooo ! Earthmen ! Up you get . Yes . Come . Helloooo ! - Earthmen ! - Hello ! Thank God . We 've found them ! Come on , hurry . We want your help . Come on , hurry . - Don 't worry about me . See to them . - Are they alive ? Freda , get lots of blankets , furs and hot liquid ! Lots of hot liquid and don 't remove their garments ! Cover them as they are . These Earthmen are in serious condition . Right . Here 's some water . Yes , he 's fine , he 's responding . He 's gonna be fine . Right again , Jack . More Earthmen for Ultima Thule . Well met in time and space . Good doctor , revel while you can . The hour is late , our end is near . The road to paradise has seized up . That 's it . Come . - Victor ... - It 's all right . They 're safe . Helena . Helena ! - Helena ! - She 's all right . She 's fine . Where 's Carter ? Alan Carter ? There were four of us . - He 's still out there ! - No ! It 's impossible . You 'd only sacrifice your own life . Ted , search for this fourth Alphan to the limit of your endurance . Stan ! Will ! Joe ! Come on ! Come on . You must rest . Keep warm . Night has fallen . Soon it will be 170 degrees below zero . We have adapted to these conditions . A death on Thule would be a marvellous thing . Shh ! Shh ! Shh ! It 's all right . You 're among friends . You 'll be quite safe here . Helena . John . - You 're safe . - Yes . Victor ? Alan ? Victor 's fine . Alan , they 're still searching for him . Helena , the planet is Ultima Thule . The people are from Earth , survivors of the Uranus expedition of 1986 . - There were survivors ? - It 's incredible , but they 're here . Remember Dr Rowland ? Doctor ? - Yes . - Dr Russell . - Dr ... Cabot Rowland ! - Yes . - You 've saved our lives . - And , er ... I am delighted . Victor . Our Alan ? Can he survive ? Seven of our party perished on their first night here . ♪ Hey day , hey day , misery me , lackaday dee ♪ He sipped no sup and he craved no crumb ♪ As he sighed for the love of a lady ♪ Stop it , Jack . Now , come and be introduced in the proper fashion . Dr Russell , Colonel Jack Tanner , Commander of the Uranus probe . Call me Jack , for I am Jack the fool . The good doctor will hang me in your heads . I go to hang my hat . Jack , come on . Commander , please sit down . Mr Bergman , please . You need nourishment . You all do . And lots of liquid . No ! Not this way ... No , Commander , you must eat only your rations as yet . When we arrived , whatever we ate made us violently sick . We adapted in time . But the drink is fine , it 's thoroughly tested . How did you arrive here ? Our last news of the Uranus probe was Jack Tanner 's report that it was breaking up in a proton storm . - That was some 14 years ago . - It is an amazing story . The ship lost control , instruments askew , prayers unanswered . We travelled at unbelievable speed ... to the farthest limit of the then-known universe . And beyond , yes ... Finally , crash landing here , blessed to be alive . Amen . Before it sticks in my throat . - Yes , Ted ? - He hasn 't a chance , Doctor . The cold is more than even we can endure . We 'll search again by daylight , but I ... I 'm sorry . With our claws , we 'll dig him up again . - Jack . - Poor Jack 's a-cold . You 're exhausted , and should sleep . Tomorrow we 'll look at the future . But above all , welcome to Ultima Thule . Thank you . Sunrise , Kano ? Yeah . It 's little more than a technicality on the ice planet . - Smog 's still dense . - We must try again . We 'll transmit at full power . If they 're alive , they must be in the Eagle . Temperature reached 189 below during the night . How can anything live there ? I 'm beginning to doubt it does . Even wild geese can 't live in conditions like that . - Link up . - Full power . Hello , Eagle 1 . Do you hear me ? 'Eagle 1 , if you can hear me , you must lift off immediately . 'Icing conditions are worsening . 'Come in , Eagle 1 . Alpha calling . 'Eagle 1 , do you copy ? 'Report , Eagle 1 . Report your situation . 'Do you hear me , Eagle 1 ? Do you copy , Eagle ... ' 'Eagle 1 , this is Alpha . Come in Eagle 1 , do you copy ? 'Eagle 1 , do you copy ? Do you hear me , Eagle 1 ? 'Do you copy , Eagle 1 ? This is Alpha . Eagle 1 , this is Alpha . 'Eagle 1 , do you copy ? ' Alpha ... Alpha , I can hear you . 'Come in , Eagle 1 . Do you copy ? ' Paul . Paul , I can hear you . Do you copy ? Paul , do you hear me ? Perhaps we are just not hearing them . We are transmitting on interstellar strength , but they can 't . Eagle 1 , this is Alpha . Eagle 1 , do you copy ? 'Come in , Eagle 1 . Alpha calling . 'Hello , Eagle 1 . Do you hear me ? ' Alpha . Alpha , in case you can hear me , I gotta take off out of here before I 'm buried . Doctor , we must speak to Alpha . Yes , I have been trying since dawn . The smog is too thick . We 'll try again . Come on . It 's this way . Hello , Moonbase Alpha . This is Ultima Thule . Do you copy ? This is Ultima Thule . Do you copy ? Perhaps the smog will clear . I 'll leave someone here calling constantly . I don 't understand why we can 't hear them . I have tried everything . If you could take me to the Eagle , perhaps we can make contact , let them know we 're safe and alive . If you can hear me , I 'm going to try and get rid of some of this snow . Full power . Come on , you beautiful bird . Lift off . Lift off ! That 's Alan , it must be ! He 's all right . Alan ! Alan ! You beauty . I made it ! Paul . Paul , I 've made it ! Alan ! Alan ! Thank heavens he 's safe . The moon is only within range five more days . We have to let Alpha know we 're still alive ! Alpha ? Alpha , do you copy now ? 'Alpha , this is Eagle 1 . Do you copy ? - ' Come in , Alpha . ' - Yes , Alan , we copy . Report ? 'There 's no good news , Paul . I 'm the only one on board . - ' We went to that signal source . ' - And ? 'Nothing . 'There 's nothing but snow , ice , smog . ' What about the others ? 'They must be dead . 'We got lost in the smog . We were separated . 'Just by sheer chance I ... I stumbled back on the ship . 'The others never made it back . ' Alan , there 's nothing you can do . Return to base . We grew these from seeds salvaged from the spaceship . And you built all this from salvaged material , too ? Yes . We went Robinson Crusoe one better . Um ... Thulian salad . This new Thulian would like to have a taste of that . Looks delicious . In its natural form , it 's extremely bitter . It 's the staple for a species of ox found on the surface . You know , we weren 't going to give this planet a second look , but you 've made it an attractive proposition . Oh , yes , wonderful . Science in the belly and salad on the brain . Now , this looks interesting , Ted . Tell me about this . Oh , toys ! New toys for the professor . Toys to play with time . You take care , they 'll twist you out of mind . Take care , huh ? Go home . Go home . Go home to Alpha . - What does he mean ? - He 's right . You must go back to Alpha . Doom sits upon a pinnacle of rock and no birds sing . You must not stay here ! There is nothing for you . We are living people frozen in eternity . You must go home to Alpha . But Alpha isn 't home . It 's a barracks , and a barren rock flying endlessly through space . We 're looking for a real home . A place to live , to raise children . There can be no children here . But you asked us to come . There was a voice , that must have been Dr Rowland . - Yes . - Oh , yes . The doctor . But he hasn 't told you yet that here , we live forever . That we 've been here for 880 years . That we haven 't aged since the day we landed . That we are the same yesterday , today and tomorrow . And that the price of immortal life ... is impotence ! No growth ! No future ! No end ! Just ever and a day . This ! Helena ! Helena ! Alan 's all right . He found the Eagle . - He lifted off . I must contact ... - John , wait . Wait ! These people say they 're immortal , that they have lived over 800 years . I think it 's true , John . I have started to ask their computer some simple questions , but it seems my premises were all wrong . The year is 2870 . So either they , or we , must have been through some kind of time warp . Commander Koenig , the blight of human life has been death , the most brilliant minds cut off , progress held back . We have lived on Thule for 800 years . We have ... immortality . I have tried to analyse the difference between what we are now and what we once were on Earth . For in that difference lies the secret to eternal life . Now , with that secret uncovered , we shall leave Thule . There 'll be no end , only better beginnings . Nothing will hold us back . We shall find paradise . - So far , my experiments have failed . - In what way ? Because I have needed a mortal subject , but now I have you . You are the mortals I have so long needed to make the comparison . I need your help . Come , let me show you the substance of this dream . And who will make the first bid for Dr Rowland 's magic elixir ? - Do I hear one million souls ? Two ? - Jack ! Alphans are not all fools . Commander ! There . Phoenix , rising from the ashes of the Uranus probe . When we have the secret of eternal life and this ship is complete , then we shall be free ! We 'll not be dependent on your uncontrollable moon . - We 'll travel when and as we please . - Yes . But this ? This is mere technology . I want you to join me , now , in this last experiment . Together we 'll step into the greatest scientific adventure in the whole history of man . Unencumbered by death , we shall leap from planet to planet , from solar system to solar system , from galaxy to galaxy . We shall be as gods in the universe . Gods . Gods . - There is so much to tell you . - The question is ... Commander . I see a hungry mind . I 'll feed it on wormwood and gall . The revered results of 800 years of experimentation . - Revered ? - Our honoured living dead , yes . Dr Rowland and his followers never forget their gratitude to these , our friends of bygone days , who 've given their all for science . We take care of them , feed them , bathe them . They need nothing more . The ultimate welfare , where want is dead . It 's ghastly , unbelievable . Well , don 't whisper ... SHOUT ! No one can hear you . This is death on Ultima Thule . We cannot die , but we can live on , perhaps forever , in complete mindlessness . Why haven 't you tried to stop him ? We 're scientists . We all wanted to know the answer to the ultimate question . As Commander of the probe , I submitted myself to the first experiment . But I was luckier than them . I walked out of here . You ... were here ? For a long time , yes . Then I regained what we wittily call my mind . The rational doctor deplores its erraticism but ... he envies my new psychic abilities . Right now , you 're as sane as I am . It comes and goes . It comes and goes . Right now , the doctor is preparing his final great experiment . Commander ! Quickly ! Stop ! Stop the experiment ! Destroy the equipment ! Stop it ! Hold it , you fools ! Hold her . Hold it ! That 's enough ! Commander Koenig , I hold you responsible . Do you know what might have happened to you ? Dr Rowland described the experiment as a development of epsilon ray analysis . But did he tell you why ? I accepted his assurance that I would be in no danger . It is perfectly safe . Listen to me , Victor . There are dissidents here , with good reason . There 's a cave , a living graveyard , with victims , vegetables who lost their minds to science . And we have sacrificed enough . We have the secret of eternal life . Must we also seek to understand it ? You may already be adapting to Thule . I saw no reason to involve you in the mistakes and arguments of the past . I myself have resolved them . I 've learned enough to guarantee the success of this final experiment . John , I can and do accept Dr Rowland 's medical judgement , just as you often have to accept my medical judgement on Alpha . - Listen . - With eternal life 's secret , we 'll concentrate on restoring the minds of the revered ones . Then we 'll complete our spaceship . Then we 'll take our prize to the peoples of the universe , and build our new world , in which death shall have no dominion . Hallelujah ! John , don 't forget we are talking about the conquest of death , the greatest medical challenge conceivable . Everything mankind has ever desired . Except humanity . Paul , when we get into the smog you won 't hear us , but keep talking . Land us as close as you can to the original fix . - ' On top of it . ' - Next to it . Bob , switch on the infrared de-icing circuits . Auxiliary de-icers on and functioning . Jack , when Rowland begged us to come , it was your voice ... Your voice telling us to stay away . It had little effect . Though you heard it well enough . Strange , don 't you think , that now they are so close your people should suffer your loss in silence ? What do you mean ? It 's an ill wind , that carries the stink of fish . Come on , Jack , there 's more in that mind of yours than meets the ears . One thing 's straight ... I am Thule 's fool . Well , it looks as if your psychic fears were founded in hard fact . Hello , Alpha . It 's Koenig . Do you read me ? Do you read me ? Commander ! Come in , Commander . Paul , we 're alive , are you receiving me ? 'There is life here . People , people from Earth . ' Earthmen ? Alan , I hope you 're hearing this . You tell him we 'll be right there . All this , and live forever ? When do we move in , Commander ? Alan , I wish it was as simple as that . But there are Thulians who 'd rather be on Alpha than face eternity here . They must be crazy ! Commander , we must call Alpha , they 're waiting for news . Commander , they went nuts when they heard you were Ok . And when they hear we can all live here forever ? Alan ... I feel we shouldn 't stay here at all . John ... We may be on the threshold of a new step in the evolution of man . Thulians and Alphans may be the forerunners of a new race of humans as different from ourselves as we are from cavemen . Or we could be staring down a blind alley . Commander , I don 't see why you 're against it . I should have thought that it was a matter of individual choice . All of you could come . Those of you who prefer mortality , on the off chance of bumping into a pleasant planet , - can stay on Alpha if they choose . - Yeah . - That 's reasonable , John . - A democratic choice . Sounds fair enough to me . - No . - Oh , John , you surely ... Alpha cannot function without trained men to operate it . Freedom of choice is out of the question . Either all of us come , or all of us stay . I 'm not prepared to make that decision . Therefore , I suggest a vote , a majority decision . As Commander , I 'll accept it . - That 's a workable solution . - Fair enough . ♪ Glory , glory Hallelujah Glory , glory Hallelujah ♪ - All right , Jack , come on . - Get off , Doctor . Yes , Commander , a fair decision . The only fair decision . But first , the Alphans must be given all the facts . And they must hear what living on Thule will mean to them . Then they will vote . All right . I 'll agree to that . Good . Then I shall go to them . I shall tell them about our way of life here - eternal life . Lives of challenge and dedication . Lives of service to the highest purpose of all . Yes . They will hear me . They shall not fail me . Wait a minute ! The Alphans have the right to know the whole truth . They must be told everything about life on Thule . I shall go with you . No ! No . You shan 't go ! And nor should you . By all dishevelled , wondering stars , I tell you ! Death has dominion . Alan , take Dr Rowland to the Eagle . Thank you . If you 'll permit me , I 'll speak on your behalf . I 'll state your case fairly , yours and Jack 's . Oh , thank you . Jack , I need your help . Come with me , Jack . There 's something you know . Jack , this is no place for you , your mind 's too sharp . Jack , if I win my case , I 'll not see you again . You ... will ... win . Tell me what you know . Then , it 's goodbye . Thule is a jealous woman . She will never let us go . Leaving gravitational pull and switching to automatic . As I recollect human nature ... we shall soon be returning with a full complement . Alphans and Thulians will walk together into the future . And what a future ! Alan , I 'd like to be able to count on you for support . Most times , you know you can do that . But this time ... Commander , I just don 't see your problem . 'Death has dominion . ' Well , Commander , not to be outdone , we have also cast our votes , if the outcome is of interest to mere mortals . Jack , what have you decided ? We have abandoned our search for the secret of eternal life . Instead , we 've turned our minds and resources to the problems of restoring the revered ones . Jack , wherever we are , the future of Thule will haunt us to the end . We pray for your success . 'Goodbye . ' 'Goodbye ! ' Is it death that gives meaning to life in the end ? 'If there is an end . '

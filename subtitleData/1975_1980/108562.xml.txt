 This is com station Epsilon 9 calling USS Columbia . Come in , Columbia . Respond , please . This is Scout Columbia , Epsilon 9 . Couldyou boostyourtransmission ? This is Epsilon 9 , Columbia . Am boosting output . Howreadyou this ? Fine , fine . Thankyou , Epsilon 9 . Receivingyourtransmission . Scout Columbia , NCC-621 ... to rendezvous with Scout Revere , NCC-595 ... on stardate 741 1.4 . Furtherorders willbe relayedat that time . SignedCommodore Prober to Starfleet . - Endoftransmission . - Received . Thankyou . Our sensor drone is intercepting this on Quad L-1 4 . That 's within Klingon boundaries . Who are they fiighting ? Unknown , sir . I have an exterior visual . We 've plotted a course on that cloud , Commander . It will pass into Federation space fairly close to us . Heading ? Sir , it 's on a precise heading for Earth . Commander Sonak . You received your appointment as Enterprise science offiicer ? Based , I am told , on your recommendation , Admiral . Thankyou . Then why aren 't you aboard ? Captain Decker requested I complete fiinal science briefiing here before- - - Here ? - we leave on our mission . At Starfleet ? The Enterprise is in fiinal preparation to leave dock . Which will require 20 more hours at minimum- - Twelve . I 'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura ... which will not last more than three minutes . Report to me in one hour . - Admiral ! - Mr. Scott . Those departure orders- - 1 2 hours . Starfleet cannot be serious . Why aren 't the Enterprise transporters operating , Mr. Scott ? A wee problem , sir . Just temporary . Admiral , we havejust fiinished 1 8 months ... redesigning and refiitting the Enterprise . How in hell do they expect me to have her ready in 1 2 hours ? Take me over , please . She needs more work , sir . A shakedown ! Mr. Scott , an alien object of unbelievable destructive power ... is less than three days away from this planet . The only starship in interception range is the Enterprise . Ready or not , she launches in 1 2 hours . The crew haven 't had near enough transition time ... with all the new equipment . And the engines- - They 're not even tested at warp power . And an untried captain . Two-and-a-halfyears as chiefofStarfleet Operations ... may have made me a little stale , but I ... wouldn 't exactly consider myself untried . - They gave her back to me , Scotty . - Gave her back , sir ? I doubt it was that easy with Nogura . You 're right . Well , any man who could manage such a feat ... - Thankyou , Mr. Scott . - Aye , sir . Cargo bayto launch crew . - Permission to come aboard , sir . - Granted , sir . Welcome aboard , Admiral . Commander Scott , you 're needed in Engineering immediately . Sir , you 'll excuse me . Flight deck , prepare foran incoming shuttlecraft . Ifyou 'll follow me , I 'll show you- - I think I can fiind my way , Ensign . Aye , sir . Bridge . What 's the problem ? I thought you people had that circuit patched in an hour ago . We did . We had to disconnect it . All right . Take out- - It 's going to take us longer that way . We 're trying to save time . I 'm still waiting for a check on the line . What 's holding it up ? As soon as somebody can get to it . What 's the next program ? I 'll get somebody down there as soon as I can , Cleary . Captain ! Starfleetjust signaled your transfer ofcommand orders . - Captain . - I appreciate the welcome . I wish the circumstances were less critical . Epsilon 9 is monitoring the intruder . Keep a channel open to them . Aye , sir . - Where 's Captain Decker ? - He 's in Engineering , sir . He- - He doesn 't know . - Mr. Chekov . - Aye , sir . Assemble the crew on the recreation deck at 0400 hours . I want to show them what we 're facing . He wanted her back . He got her . And Captain Decker ? He 's been with this ship every minute of her refiitting . Ensign , the possibilities of our returning from this mission ... in one piece may havejust doubled . Check Cleary on number six . - Need your cooler status . - Stand by . Space matrix restoration coils . Dilithium crystals . I knew it . The transporter sensor was not activated . Air equalization . Automatic off . Faulty module . Cleary , put a new backup sensor into the unit . Aye , sir . Admiral Kirk ! Well , we 're getting a top brass send-off . Don 't worry , she 'll launch on schedule ... ifwe have to tow her out with our bare hands , right , Scotty ? Aye . That we will , sir . - I 'm really too busy . - I 'm taking over the center seat . You 're what ? I 'm replacing you as captain ofthe Enterprise . You 'll stay on as executive offiicer . Temporary grade reduction to commander . You personally are assuming command ? Yeah . - May I ask why ? - My experience . Five years out there dealing with unknowns like this . My familiarity with the Enterprise and its crew . Admiral , this is an almost totally new Enterprise . You don 't know her a tenth as well as I do . That 's why you 're staying aboard . I 'm sorry , Will . No , Admiral , I don 't thinkyou 're sorry . Not one damn bit . Well , sir , it looks like you found a way . Report to the bridge , Commander , immediately . Aye , sir . Transporter room ! Come in ! Urgent ! Redline on the transporter , Mr. Scott ! Transporter , do not engage ! - It 's too late . They 're beaming now . - Do not- - Do you read me , Starfleet ? Override it ! Pull them back ! Unable to retrieve theirpattern , Enterprise . Starfleet , boost your matter gain . We need more signal . More signal ! - We 're losing their pattern ! - Oh , no , they 're forming . Starfleet , do you have them ? Enterprise , what wegot back didn ' t live long , fortunately . Commander Sonak 's can be reached through the Vulcan embassy . There was nothing you could have done , Rand . It wasn 't your fault . Yeoman , turboshaft 8 ? Back that way , sir . We have to replace Commander Sonak . In fact , there 's no one who 's fully rated on this design . You are , Mr. Decker . I 'm afraid you 're going to have to double as science offiicer . That 's all we know about it ... except that it is now 53.4 hours away from Earth . Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way . and possible . Bridge to Captain . Prioritysignalfrom Epsilon 9 . - Put it on viewer . - On viewer , sir . Enterprise , the cloudis definitely apowerfieldofsome kind . Measures- - My God- - overtwoAU 's in diameter . Must besomething incredible inside theregenerating it . We 're transmitting linguacode friendship messages ... on allfrequencies . No response . Ihave a nullreading at the centerofthe cloud . Definitelysomething inside there , butscansare being reflectedback . - Some kindofpowersurge . - Receivingan oddpattern now . Enterprise , theycouldbe mistaking ourscansasa hostile act . Theyseem to be reacting to ourscans , sir . Deflectors , emergency full ! Prelaunch countdown will commence in 40 minutes . Transporter system fully repaired and functioning normally , sir . Dock signals clear , Captain . Reply we are holding position , awaiting fiinal crew replacements . Aye , sir . Transporter personnel reports ... the navigator , Lieutenant llia- - She 's already aboard and en route to the bridge , sir . She 's Deltan , Captain . - Hello , llia . - Decker . I was stationed on the lieutenant 's home planet some years ago . Commander Decker ? Yes , our exec and science offiicer . Captain Kirk has the utmost confiidence in me . And in you , too , Lieutenant . My oath ofcelibacy is on record , Captain . - May I assume my duties ? - By all means . Starfleet reports our last six crew members are ready to beam up ... but one ofthem is refusing to step into the transporter . Oh ? I 'll see to it that he beams up . Transporter room . - Yeoman ? - Yes , sir ? - What was the problem down there ? - He insisted we go fiirst , sir . Said something about fiirst seeing how it scrambled our molecules . Beam that offiicer up now . Well , for a man who swore he 'd never return to Starfleet- - Just a moment , Captain , sir . I 'll explain what happened . Your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little-known ... seldom-used reserve activation clause . In simpler language , Captain , they drafted me ! They didn 't . This was your idea . This was your idea , wasn 't it ? Bones , there 's a thing out there . Why is any object we don 't understand always called a thing ? Headed this way . I need you . Badly ! Permission to come aboard . Permissiongranted , sir . Well , Jim , I hear Chapel 's an MD now . Well , I 'm going to need a top nurse ... not a doctor who will argue every little diagnosis with me . And they probably redesigned the whole sick bay too ! I know engineers . They love to change things . Dock control reports ready , sir . - Helm ready , sir . - Orbital departure on plot , sir . Yard command signaling clear , sir . - Maneuvering thrusters , Mr. Sulu . - Maneuvering thrusters , sir . Hold station . Thrusters at station-keeping , sir . Thrusters ahead , Mr. Sulu . Take us out . Intermix set , Bridge . Impulse power at your discretion . Impulse power , Mr. Sulu . Ahead warp .5 . Departure angle on viewer . Departure angle . - Viewer ahead . - Viewer ahead . Captain ' slog . Stardate 7412 . 6 ... 1.8hours from launch . In orderto intercept the intruder at the earliestpossible time ... we must nowrisk engaging warp drive whilestill within thesolarsystem . Captain , assuming we have full warp capability ... accelerating to warp 7 on leaving the solar system ... will bring us to IP with the intruder in 20.1 hours . Well , Bones , do the new medical facilities meet with your approval ? They do not . It 's like working in a damn computer center . - Programming ready ? - Set for standard warp entry . Engineering , stand by for warp drive . Captain , we needfurther warp simulation on the flowsensors . Engineer , we need warp speed now ! Jim , you 're pushing . Your people know theirjobs . That 's it , sir . I can 't do any better . Aye , lad . It 's borderline on the simulator . I cannot guarantee she 'll hold up . Warp drive , Mr. Scott . - Ahead warp 1 , Mr. Sulu . - Accelerating to warp 1 , sir . Warp .7 , .8 . Wormhole . Get us back on impulse power . Full reverse . Negative helm control , Captain . Going reverse on impulse power . Subspace frequenciesjammed , sir ! Wormhole effect ! Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22.5 seconds ... before forward velocity slows to sublight speed . Unidentifiied small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us . - Directly ahead . - Force fiields up full . Put object on viewer . Navigational deflectors coming up , sir . Wormhole distortion has overloaded the main power systems . Navigational deflectors inoperative , Captain . Directional control also inoperative . Time to impact ? Twenty seconds . Mr. Chekov , stand by on phasers . No ! Belay that phaser order ! Arm photon torpedoes ! armed ! Object is an asteroid . Reading mass .7 . Targeting ... asteroid ! Impact in ten seconds . Impact in eight seconds . - Fire torpedoes ! - Six ! Torpedoes away ! Five ! Helm control restored , sir . - Position report , Navigator . - Computing new intersection course . Communications are normal , sir . Negative damage reported , Captain . No casualties reported , Doctor . Wrong , Mr. Chekov . There are casualties . My wits , as in " frightened out of , " Captain , sir . We were at warp .8 . Engineer , report your status there . In just a second , Exec . We 're picking up the pieces down here . Mr. Scott , we need warp drive as soon as possible . That object is less than two days away from Earth . We need to intercept while it still is out there . Lay in a heading to conform with our initial IP with the intruder . Mr. Sulu , you have the conn . Mr. Decker . - I 'd like to see you in my quarters . - Mind if I tag along , Captain ? Level 5 . All right , explanation . Why was my phaser order countermanded ? The Enterprise redesign increases phaser power ... by channeling it through the main engines . When they went into antimatter imbalance ... the phasers were automatically cut off . Then you acted properly , ofcourse . - You saved the ship . - I 'm aware ofthat , sir . Stop competing with me , Decker . - Permission to speak freely , sir ? - Granted . Sir , you haven 't logged a single star hour in two-and-a-halfyears . That , plus your unfamiliarity with the ship 's redesign ... in my opinion , sir , seriously jeopardizes this mission . I trust you will ... nursemaid me through these diffiiculties ? Yes , sir , I 'll do that . Then I won 't keep you from your duties any longer , Commander . - Yes , Doctor ? - Aye , sir . He may be right , Jim . About as diffiicult as seeing you again . - I 'm sorry . - That you left Delta IV ? Or that you didn 't even say good-bye ? If I had seen you again ... would you have been able to say it ? No . Make your point , Doctor . The point , Captain , is that it 's you who is competing . You rammed getting this command down Starfleet 's throat . You 've used this emergency to get the Enterprise back . to far more immediate and critical responsibilities . Your reaction to Decker is an example , Jim . - Bridge to Captain . - Viewer on . Signalfrom a Federation registered long-rangeshuttle , sir . She wishes to come alongside andlock on . For what purpose ? Mysecurityscan shows it has agrade-onepriority , Captain . Nonbelligerencyconfirmed . Isuspect it isa courier ofsome kind . Very well , Mr. Chekov . See to it . Viewer off . Your opinion has been noted . Anything further ? That depends on you . - Permission to come aboard , sir . - Granted , sir . Granted . Why- - Why , it 's Mister- - Spock ! Spock . Commander , if I may ? If- - Oh . I offer my services as science offiicer ... with all due respect , Commander . - Ifour exec has no objections . - Ofcourse not . I 'm well aware of Mr. Spock 's qualifiications . Mr. Chekov , log Mr. Spock 's Starfleet commission reactivated . List him as science offiicer . Both effective immediately . Mr. Spock . Well , so help me , I 'm actually pleased to see you . It 's how we all feel , Mr. Spock . Captain , with your permission ... I will now discuss these fuel equations with the engineer . Captain ' slog . Stardate 7413.4 . Thanks to Mr. Spock 's timelyarrivalandassistance ... we have the engines rebalanced into full warp capacity . Repairtime . less than three hours . Which means we willnowbe able to intercept intruder ... whilestillmore than a day from Earth . Warp .8 . .9 . Warp 3 . Warp 4 . Warp 5 . Warp 6 . Warp 7 . Science Offiicer Spock , reporting as ordered , Captain . Please , sit down . Spock , you haven 't changed a bit . You 'rejust as warm and sociable as ever . At last report , you were on Vulcan ... apparently to stay . Yes , you were undergoing the " Kolanear " discipline . Sit down . Ifyou are referring to the Kolinahr , Doctor , you are correct . Well , however it 's pronounced , Mr. Spock , it 's the Vulcan ritual ... that 's supposed to purge all remaining emotions . The Kolinahr is also a discipline you broke tojoin us . Will you , please , sit down ? On Vulcan I began sensing a consciousness ... from a source more powerful than I have ever encountered . I believe it may hold my answers . Isn 't it lucky foryou that wejust happened to be heading your way ? Bones ! We need him . I need him . Then my presence is to our mutual advantage . Any thought patterns you might sense ... whether they appear to affect you personally or not ... I expect immediately reported . Ofcourse , Captain . - Is there anything else ? - No . is as important to him as he says it is , how do we know- - That he wouldn 't put his own interests ahead ofthe ship 's ? I could never believe that . How do we know about any of us ? Bridge to Officers 'Lounge . Captain Kirk . Revisedestimate on cloud visualcontact .. 3.7minutes. On my way . Order new backup settings there . Presentstatus . Give usapriority , Commander . Bridge Communication to Flight Conn . Checkyoursubspace alignment . Standard light , Engineer . - Full mag on viewer . - Full mag , sir . All decks and divisions confiirmed . Status red . Captain , we are being scanned . Do not return scan , Mr. Spock . It could be misinterpreted as hostility . Intruder scans emanating from the exact center ofthe cloud . Energy ofa type ... never before encountered . There 's no response to friendship messages , sir . - Shall I go to battle stations ? - Negative . We 'll take no provocative action . Recommend defensive posture , Captain . Screens and shields . No , Mr. Decker , that could also be misinterpreted as hostile . Cloud composition , Mr. Spock ? - Twelfth-power energy fileid . - Twelfth-power ? We 've seen what their weapons can do . Shouldn 't we take every precaution ? - Mr. Decker- - - Captain . I will not provoke an attack . Ifthat order isn 't clear enough- - Captain , as your exec it 's my duty ... to point out alternatives . Yes , it is . I stand corrected . Five minutes to cloud boundary . Navigator , lay in a conic section flight path to the cloud center . Bring us parallel to whatever we fiind in there . Mr. Sulu , tactical plot on viewer . Tactical on viewer , sir . That measures 1 2th-power energy ? Thousands ofstarships couldn 't generate that much- - I sense ... puzzlement . We have been contacted . Why have we not replied ? Contacted ? How ? Force fiields up full . Deflectors , now . Force fiields and deflectors up full , Captain . Analysis , Mr. Spock . Alien weapon is a form of plasma energy , Captain . Exact composition unknown . Guidance system unknown . Engineering , status report . Systems overloading , Captain . Medic . Medics are coming . Engineering to Bridge . Cannot hold full power on force fiields . Deflector power is down 70 percent . Divert auxiliary power to deflectors . Oh , good . Christine , it 's Chekov . Medic . I can stop his pain . Thankyou . Captain . The intruder has been attempting to communicate . Frequency : more than one million megahertz ... and at such a high rate ofspeed ... their entire message lasts only a millisecond . I am now programming our computer ... to transmit linguacode at their frequency and rate ofspeed . Commander . Spock ! Here it comes . Engineering , what 's happening to our force fileid ? Our shields cannot handle another attack . Mr. Spock . Spock . Fifteen seconds . Spock , transmit now . Ten seconds . Transmitting . It would seem our friendship messages ... have been received and understood , Mr. Spock . Captain ... we are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality . Yet they cannot understand ... who we are or what we want . And yet it would seem that they understood our message . They broke offthe attack . They may have attacked only as a warning to us , Captain ... to keep away . That would presuppose a feeling ... Commander . Compassion . I sense no emotion . Only pure logic . Mr. Sulu , hold present position . Holding present position , sir . Tactical plot on viewer . Opinion , Mr. Spock . Recommend we proceed , Captain . - Mr. Decker ? - I advise caution , Captain . We can 't withstand another attack . That thing is 20 hours away from Earth . - We know nothing about it as yet . - Precisely the point , Captain . We don 't know what it 'll do . Moving into that cloud at this time ... is an unwarranted gamble . How do you defiine " unwarranted " ? You asked my opinion , sir . Viewer . Standard ahead . Navigator , maintain course . Helmsman ... Spock . Instruments fluctuating , Captain . Patterns unrecognizable . Transmit image ofalien to Starfleet . Advise we are attempting further communication . Unable to make contact with Starfleet , Captain . Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud is being reflected back . Reduce magnifiication factor four , Mr. Sulu . We are already two settings below that , sir . Mr. Sulu ... bring us into a parallel course ... over the alien ... at 500 meters . Five hundred meters ? Then take us out to 1 00 kilometers distance ... adjusting parallel course . Aye , sir . Viewer astern . Reverse angle on the view , Captain . Five hundred meters . Viewer ahead , sir . Hold relative position here . Mr. Spock ! Can that be one oftheir crew ? A probe from their vessel , Captain . Plasma-energy combination . Don 't interfere with it . Absolutely , I will not interfere . No one interfere . It doesn 't seem interested in us . Only the ship . Computer off . It 's taking control ofthe computer . It 's running our records- - Earth defenses , Starfleet strength . Ilia ! Ilia ! This is how I defiine " unwarranted . " Activate auxiliary computer circuits through manual shutoff . Get someone up here to take the navigator 's station . - Engineering . - Chief DiFalco , to the bridge . - Emergency power . - Going to fullemergency . But , Captain , ifwe don 't break free in 1 5 seconds , she 'll burn up . We cannot break free , Captain . We have only a fraction ofthe power necessary . Engineering , belay that order . Disengage all main drive systems . Chief DiFalco , take over Lieutenant Ilia 's station . DiFalco , disengage engine navigation relays now . Aye , sir . Commander ? Ready to launch remote communications drone ... with complete ship 's records ... including our present situation , sir . Delay launching as long as possible . Our drone can 't escape as long as we 're held in their tractor . Aye . Captain , a maximum phaser strike directly at the beam ... might weaken itjust enough for us to break free . Break free to where , Commander ? Any show of resistance would be futile , Captain . We don 't know that , Mr. Spock . Why are you opposed to trying ? Why bring us inside ? Not to destroy us . They could have done that outside . They still can . Captain , photic sonar readings indicate the aperture is closing . We 're trapped , sir . Reverse angle on the viewer , Captain . Tractor beam has released us , Captain . Confiirmed . Vessel is floating free . No forward momentum . Maneuvering thrusters , Mr. Sulu . Ahead one third . Thrusters ahead one third . Let 's take a look . Full sensor scan , Mr. Spock . They can 't expect us not to look them over now . Now that we 're looking down their throat . Right , now that we 've got them just where they want us . It 's closing up . Hold position . Captain . What do you make ofall this ? I believe the closed orifiice leads to another chamber ... undoubtedly part of the vessel 's inner mechanism . I suspect it may be necess- - Intruder alert ! Deck 5 . Offiicer 's quarters . Have Security meet me at deck 5 , main elevator . Spock . Mr. Decker , you have the conn . Hold positions . I have been programmed by V 'Ger ... to observe and record ... normal functions ofthe carbon-based units ... infesting USS Enterprise . - Jim , what 's going on ? - Tricorder . Who is ... V 'Ger ? V 'Ger is that which programmed me . Is V 'Ger the name ofthe captain ofthe alien vessel ? Jim . This is a mechanism . A probe , Captain . No doubt a sensor-transceiver combination ... I 've been given its form ... to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units ... infesting Enterprise . Carbon-based units ? Humans , Ensign Perez . Us . Why does V 'Ger travel ... to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead ? To fiind the creator . Find the creator ? Whose- - What does V 'Ger want with the creator ? Tojoin with him . Tojoin with the creator ? How ? V 'Ger and the creator will become one . And who is the creator ? The creator is that which created V 'Ger . Who is V 'Ger ? V 'Ger is that which seeks the creator . might provide some insight into those who manufactured it ... and how to deal with them . Fine . Let 's get her to sick bay . I 'm programmed to observe and record ... only the normal functioning ofthe carbon-based units . The , uh ... examination is a normal function . You may proceed . Micro-miniature hydraulics ... sensprs ... and molecule-sized multiprocessor chips . And take a look at this . Every exocrine system is the same , too ... even eye moisture . Decker . Fascinating . Not " Decker unit . " Gentlemen . Will . - What happened to her ? - Captain . This probe may be our key to the aliens . - Probe ? llia ? - Exactly . It is a programmed mechanism , Commander . Its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail . Suppose that , beneath its programming ... the real llia 's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision . Ilia 's memory ... her feelings of loyalty , obedience , friendship ... might all be there . You did have a relationship with Lieutenant Ilia , Commander . That probe , in another form , is what killed llia . Commander- - Will , we 're locked in an alien vessel ... six hours from Earth 's orbit . Our only contact with our captor is that probe . Ifwe can control it , persuade it , use it- - I have recorded enough here . You will now assist me further . The , uh ... Decker unit can assist you with much greater effiiciency . Carry on with your assignment , Mr. Decker . Aye , sir . Captain ' slog . Stardate 7414 . 1 . Ourbest estimatesplace us some fourhours from Earth . No significantprogress thus far ... reviving llia memorypatterns within the alienprobe . This remains ouronlymeans ofcontact with ourcaptor . Allthose vessels were called Enterprise . The carbon units use this area for recreation . This is one ofthe games . What types of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy ? The words " recreation " ... Ilia enjoyed this game . She nearly always won . Good . He 's using audiovisual association . Why does Enterprise require the presence ofcarbon units ? Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units . More data concerning this functioning is necessary ... before carbon units can be patterned ... for data storage . What does that mean ? When my examination is complete ... all carbon units will be reduced to data patterns . Within you ... are the memory patterns ofa certain carbon unit . If I can help you to revive those patterns ... you could understand our functions better . I remember Lieutenant Ilia once mentioning she wore that . Put it on . On Delta . Remember ? Ilia . Dr. Chapel . Will ? Ilia . Commander . Commander . Ilia ... help us make direct contact with V 'Ger . I cannot . This creator V 'Ger is looking for- - what is it ? V 'Ger does not know . Computer , commence recording . Captain Kirk , these messages will detail my attempt ... I intend to calculate thruster ignition and acceleration rate ... to coincide with the opening ofthe V 'Ger orifiice . This should facilitate a better view ... ofthe interior ofthe alien spacecraft . Captain , Starfleet signals are growing in strength , sir . They still have the intruder on their monitors . - It 's decelerating . - Confiirmed , sir . Lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into Earth orbit . Sir , air lock 4 has been opened . A thruster suit is reported missing . A thruster suit ? That 's Spock . Damn him . Bring him back here . No , wait . I have successfully penetrated ... the next chamber ofthe alien 's interior ... and I 'm witnessing some sort ofdimensional image ... which I believe to be a representation ... ofV 'Ger 's home planet . I 'm passing through a connecting tunnel . Apparently , a kind of plasma-energy conduit . Possibly a fileid coil for a gigantic imaging system . It could be a representation ofV 'Ger 's entirejourney . But who or what ... are we dealing with ? The Epsilon 9 station , stored here with every detail . Captain , I am now quite convinced ... that all ofthis is V 'Ger ... that we are inside a living machine . Ilia . The sensor ... must contain some special meaning . Spock . Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiiber connection . Indications ofsome neurological trauma . The power pouring through that mind-meld must have been staggering . Spock . Jim . I should have known . Were you right ... about V 'Ger ? A life-form of its own . A conscious , living entity . A planet populated by living machines . Unbelievable technology . V 'Ger has knowledge that spans this universe . And yet ... with all its pure logic ... V 'Ger is barren ... cold . No mystery . No beauty . Should have known . Known ? Known what ? Spock . What should you have known ? What should you have known ? Jim ... is beyond V 'Ger 's comprehension . No meaning , no hope . Jim ... np answers . It 's asking questions . " Is this ... all that I am ? Is there nothing more ? " Bridge to Captain . Kirk here . A faint signal from Starfleet , sir . Intruder cloud has been located on their outer monitors ... for the past 27 minutes . Cloud dissipating rapidly as it approaches . We are three minutes from Earth orbit . I 'll be right there . I need Spock on the bridge . Dalaphaline , fiive cc 's . Captain , Starfleet is sending this tactical on V 'Ger 's position . V 'Ger is transmitting a signal . Jim . From V 'Ger . V 'Ger signals the creator . A simple binary code ... transmitted by carrier wave signal . Radio . Radio ? Jim . V 'Ger expects an answer . An answer ? I don 't know the question . The creator has not responded . All planetary defense systems havejust gone inoperative . Sir , Starfleet computes the devices are proceeding ... toward equidistant positions orbiting the planet . They 're the same things that hit us . They are hundreds oftimes more powerful , Captain . From those positions ... they could devastate the entire surface ofthe planet . Why ? You infest Enterprise . You interfere with the creator in the same manner . Carbon units are not an infestation . They are ... a natural function ofthe creator 's planet . They are living things . They are not true life-forms . Only the creator and other similar life-forms are true . " Similar life-forms . " Jim , V 'Ger is saying its creator is a machine . A machine . Captain . I suggest you treat it as such . - A child ? - Yes , Captain . A child ... evolving , learning , searching ... instinctively needing . - Needing what ? - Spock . This child is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth . Now , what do you suggest we do ? Spank it ? It knows only that it needs , Commander . But , like so many of us ... it does not know what . The carbon units know why the creator has not responded . Captain . I 'm losing Starfleet . Interference from V 'Ger . Kirk unit , disclose the information . Why has the creator not responded ? No . Secure all stations . Clear the bridge . Clear the bridge , Captain ? - That was the order , Mr. Sulu . - Aye , sir . Your child is having a tantrum , Mr. Spock . V 'Ger requires the information . Bridge , secure all stations . Move out . IfV 'Ger destroys the Enterprise ... the information that V 'Ger requires will also be destroyed . It is illogical to withhold required information . Kirk unit ! Kirk unit . Why do you not disclose information ? Because V 'Ger 's going to destroy all carbon units on the third planet . They have repressed the creator . The information will not be disclosed . V 'Ger needs the information . Then V 'Ger must withdraw all the orbiting devices . V 'Ger will comply ... ifthe carbon units will disclose the information . It learns fast , doesn 't it ? Captain , the vessel- - V 'Ger- - Precisely . The carbon unit 's information cannot be disclosed to V 'Ger 's probe ... but only to V 'Ger directly . Forward motion , Captain . Tractor beam . Captain , what 's the next move ? The question is , Mr. Decker ... is there a next move ? Resume duty stations . All personnel , resume stations . Well , Mr. Decker , it seems my bluff has been called . I 'm afraid our hand is pretty weak , Captain . Mr. Chekov , when do those devices reach fiinal position ? Twenty-seven minutes . Mark . - Engineering . - Scott here . Mr. Scott , be prepared to execute Starfleet order 2-0-0-5 . When , sir ? On my command . Aye , sir . Why has the captain ordered self-destruct , sir ? I would say , lass , because he thinks- - he hopes that when we go up , we 'll take the intruder with us . Will we ? When that much matter and antimatter are brought together ... oh , yes , we will indeed . Starfleet has been apprised ofour situation , Captain . Crewstatus is 1-7-2 at dutystations ... 2-4-8 off-duty ... 1 1 in sickbay0-9'er . Tractor beam remains constant . We are 1 7 kilometers inside the vessel . Engineering , showme yourpylon stress readings . Deck4 , that temperature shouldread 1-0-1-3 degrees . Please confirm . Spock . Mr. Spock . No , Captain , not for us . For V 'Ger . I weep for V 'Ger as I would for a brother . As I was when I came aboard ... so is V 'Ger now- - empty , incomplete and searching . Logic and knowledge are not enough . Spock , are you saying that you found what you needed ... but V 'Ger hasn 't ? What would V 'Ger need to fulfiill itself ? Each of us ... at some time in our lives , turns to someone- - a father , a brother , a god ... and asks ... " Why am I here ? What was I meant to be ? " " Is this all that I am ? ls there nothing more ? " Captain . Forward motion slowing , Captain . Captain , I believe that is our destination . I read an oxygen-gravity envelope forming outside the Enterprise . Forward motion stopped , Captain . That transmitter is a vital link between V 'Ger and its creator . The carbon units will now provide V 'Ger ... with the required information . Mr. Spock . Bones . Mr. Decker , I will contact you every fiive minutes . Captain . I 'd like to go along . Mr. Sulu , you have the conn . V 'Ger . " V ... G-E-R . " " V-O-Y-A-G-E-R . " Voyager . Voyager 6 . NASA . National Aeronautics and Space Administration . Jim ... this was launched more than 300 years ago . Voyager series . Designed to collect data ... and transmit it back to Earth . Captain ... Voyager 6 disappeared into what they used to call a black hole . It must have emerged on the far side ofthe galaxy ... and fell into the machine planet 's gravitational fileid . The machine inhabitants found it to be one oftheir own kind- - primitive , yet kindred . They discovered its simple 20th-century programming- - collect all data possible . Learn all that is learnable . The machines interpreted it literally . They built this entire vessel ... so that Voyager could actually fulfiill its programming . And on itsjourney back ... it amassed so much knowledge ... it achieved consciousness itself . It became a living thing . Kirk unit . V 'Ger awaits the information . Enterprise ... order up the ship 's computer library records ... on the late 20th-century NASA probe Voyager 6 . Specifically , we want the oldNASA code signal ... its readiness to transmit its information . And there 's no one on Earth ... who could recognize the old signal and send a response . The creator does not answer . V 'Ger . V 'Ger . V 'Ger ! We are the creator . That is not logical . Carbon units are not true life-forms . We will prove it . We will make it possible foryou to complete your programming . Only the creator could accomplish that . and transmit the code now . Transmitting . 5-0-4 ... 3-2-9 ... 3-1 - 7 ... 5-1 - 0 ... and the fiinal sequence . That should trigger Voyager 's transmitter . Voyager is not transmitting its data , Captain . The creator mustjoin with V 'Ger . Uhura , repeat the fiinal sequence . The creator mustjoin with V 'Ger . Voyager is not transmitting , Captain ... because it did not receive the fiinal sequence . Jim , we 're down to ten minutes . Enterprise , stand by . - The antenna leads are melted away . - Yes , Captain , just now . By V 'Ger itself . - Why ? - To prevent reception . Ofcourse . To bring the creator here . To fiinish transmitting the code in person . To touch the creator . Captain . V 'Ger must evolve . Its knowledge has reached the limits ofthis universe . It must evolve . What it requires of its god , Doctor , is the answer to its question- - Is there nothing more ? What more is there than the universe , Spock ? Other dimensions . Higher levels of being . The existence ofwhich cannot be proven logically . our capacity to leap beyond logic . Joining with its creator might accomplish that . You mean this machine wants to physicallyjoin with a human ? Is that possible ? Let 's fiind out . Decker . I 'm gonna key the fiinal sequence through the ground test computer . You don 't know what that 'll do to you ! Yes , I do , Doctor . Decker , don 't . Jim , I want this . As much as you wanted the Enterprise , I want this . Captain . Possibly a next step in our evolution . I wonder . Well , it 's been a long time since I delivered a baby . I hope we got this one off to a good start . I hope so too . I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose ... out ofour own human weaknesses ... and the drive that compels us to overcome them . And a lot offoolish human emotions . Right , Mr. Spock ? Quite true , Doctor . Unfortunately , it will have to deal with them as well . Interrogative from Starfleet . They 're requesting damage and injury reports and complete vessel status . Report two casualties . Lieutenant Ilia . Captain Decker . - Aye , sir . - Correction . They 're not casualties . They- - Aye , sir . Mr. Scott , shall we give the Enterprise a proper shakedown ? I would say it 's time for that , sir , aye . We can have you back on Vulcan in four days , Mr. Spock . Unnecessary , Mr. Scott . My task on Vulcan is completed . Mr. Sulu , ahead warp 1 . - Warp 1 , sir . - Heading , sir ? Out there . Thataway .

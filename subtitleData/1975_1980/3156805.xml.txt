 - Where did they come from ? - No indication on the scanner . - Still no reply from the planet ? - Nothing at all . Keep trying . This is Moonbase Alpha . They 're Mark IX Hawks . Alan .

'Eagle flight One will intercept . Flight Two move to backup positions . crash units stand by . 'Rescue and casualty Eagles ready . ' Main motors . 'Priority one to technical section and launch pads . stand by to receive casualties . Activate meteorite defence screens and seal bulkhead doors . Commander . - Alien ships approaching at V-14.2. That 's nearly twice the speed of our Eagles . Alan . - They have just 30 seconds . Commander . ' 15 seconds . John . - Still no signal ? - Nothing . - 10 seconds . - ' We can 't hold them ! ' - Alpha 's wide open . - Five seconds . Fire ! Alan . 'Lt was too easy . ' a new contact . - Position ? - Orbital reference 348 . Commander . cut all checks . Lift-off . We 've got ourselves a war . - You all right ? - Yeah . - Back to your posts ! Let 's go ! Commander . Damage Control units to Pad Four . Explosive decompression in the end section . Area sealed off . I want damage reports on launch pads . I want to know how long it 'll take to get the last Eagle off this rock . give me a casualty report . John . We 're at war . Position ? Hawks at 319 and closing . - Interception ? - Laser range in two minutes five . within range in two minutes . but right now you 're our only defence . Alan . 'We 'll take care of you . ' Good luck . Leader to Flight One . Select your opposite number . If any of them get through ... we won 't have a home to go to . here we go . Eagle Two ! You 're dead . We 've been hit ! Main motor . - We 're breaking up ! - Reduce power ! A sitting duck . Let 's hope they take us for a dead one . I 've lost contact with Alan . is it ready for launch ? The lift 's still jammed . Evacuate all non-essential surface areas . Secondary bulkheads will be secured in 30 seconds . Kano . You stay with me The rest of you get below . Victor . You all right ? Auxiliary lights ! Air leak ! do you hear me ? we 've got an atmosphere leak . 'Lt 's under control now but I don 't know how long it 'll hold . ' come with me . come on ! We have to get everybody out of here Let 's go ! Everybody ! Here we go . Come on . Hurry ! It won 't hold ! leave that ! Come on ! - Bob ! Bob ! I know . it 's over . help out . Commander . they 're going by the book . then they send in the bombers . There 's nothing we can do . Nothing . Alpha 's got one laser-equipped Eagle left . If they can get it launched . this one 's down to us . Head-up the target display . Pete . Laser at maximum rate . take Computer . do you copy ? we copy . ' that was terrific . It was the big one . I reckon they meant it for Alpha . 'I 'm sure they did . Didn 't know you were still alive . ' We were just playing dead . How are all of you ? - ' Pretty bad . You ? ' - We 're down to auxiliary power . I reckon we can make it back to Alpha . - What do you think they 've got next ? - We 're relying on you to tell us . how are things down there ? - ' We 're all right . What was that ? ' Their doomsday weapon . Alan got in its way . - ' Alan ? Is he ? ' - He 's all right . But it 's one hell of a mess up here . she 'll give you a safe route back . it is safe to the Commander 's office . let 's have the bad news . 128 dead . Mostly there 's no trace of them . Sucked out into space . - Explosive decompression . - Survivors ? Those that made it below are pretty much all right . Those that didn 't ... There 's just ... no halfway house . we still have emergency power . And for the moment the attack 's been called off . eh ? we 're alive The question is how to stay alive . About the emergency power we 're running off batteries . they 'll be exhausted in eight days . will take four weeks to repair . All anti-gravity units are smashed beyond repair too . Most casualties were in the Technical department . The food production and recycling plants are badly damaged . - The water is heavily contaminated . - How long to repair ? minimum . But then it would be two more months before we could begin cropping . We shall only be within range of this planet for four days . the nearest star system will be at least six months too far . put an unarmed reconnaissance Eagle on a launch pad . we 're going to that planet . - I don 't think ... - Just a minute ! I thought they were trying to tell us to keep away . they 've only stopped firing because they don 't need to bother . Alpha is dead . meet them face-to-face on their turf and try to persuade them to talk . Do you think they 'll believe we 're unarmed ? Who knows what they 'll believe . This is Moonbase Alpha calling on all frequencies . Please acknowledge . The ship approaching your planet is unarmed . requests permission to meet and to discuss our situation with your leaders . We ask for mercy to be shown to the survivors of this base . This is Moonbase Alpha calling on all frequencies ... Casualty list has increased to 131 . Professor ? perhaps . They have the same weapons as ours and fight by the same book of rules . We 've got to show them that they 've no need to be afraid of us . I think they know that already . Commander . Maybe they 're a race of deaf-mutes . ' Why should they talk when they can keep us guessing ? Compensators at Earth gravity . As computer predicted . And there 's still no sign of enemy ships . It 's beautiful . Course correction five degrees . We 're veering off . - No computer malfunction . - Correction has no affect . all systems check out fine . do you read me ? Alpha . This is Koenig . Lost contact . Switching to manual . We 're still moving off course . you are under ground control . 'Relax and stand by for touchdown . ' What do you make of it ? I wish someone would show their face or say a word . Anything . the colours ... Maybe they 're part of their language They spoke to us . Hello ! Is there anyone here we can talk to ? ! Earthman . State your case . - Speak . - Why ? Why did you attack us ? Why ? We 've been transmitting messages ever since we 've been in range . you refused to answer . war machines and bombs . we could understand . But ... we 're not here by choice . We cannot control the course of our moon . We 're looking for a place to live . We won 't use force . All we want ... is peace . damn it ! You asked me to state my case . Here it is . We came in peace . destroyed my base and left us without the means to live . - You cannot stay here . - We cannot live on Alpha ! You have no place in space at all . - You deny us our future ? - You have no future . You carry with you the seeds of your own destruction . You are a contaminating organism . A fatal virus . A plague of fear . Your presence on this planet would destroy a civilisation that has survived for billions of years . You think we 're no more than a virus ? Since we were blasted away from Earth though how I don 't know but ... what I do have is an absolute faith in the strength of the human spirit and the belief that someone or something is looking after us . if you like . And we will survive ! The death struggle of inferior species is very often the finest hour of their existence . the end I refuse to believe we have no future Extinction may take a little time . That is all . they depend on it . It looks very fragile . John ! Violence is not the answer ! I can 't accept their judgement ! down ! Earthmen ! - Still no word from the Commander ? - No . We should make a start anyway . enough to get the Eagles away . - If that 's what we want to do . - Nothing else we can do . Start Operation Exodus . No ... do not be afraid . Dr Russell . The power of your weapon will be turned against yourself . Do not be afraid . In our world there can be no fear . John ... He was a victim of his own fear . You can share our power . Giving substance to your wish that he should live . Helena ! All personnel proceed to Technical section where the Eagles are loading Closedown of services in the residence section in 15 minutes . - All equipment in maintenance ... - I have a contact ! Alpha ? Do you read me ? ' we read you ! - ' Paul we could live on this planet but we 'll have to fight for it . ' please ! Commander ? 'Bring out the last laser-equipped Eagle . 'Rendezvous here and I 'll transfer to your ship . ' Commander . John ? evacuate Alpha . 'I can 't guarantee what you 'll find here but ... at least ... ' John . Everyone 's prepared to take the chance . If I 'm not there land on open ground and consolidate your position . Victor ... Say goodbye to Alpha for me . 'Say hello to the planet . ' Last Eagle 's ready for lift-off . They just waiting for us . Paul . Recording now . We ... are Mankind . We came from planet Earth and we built this base called Alpha to learn more about space . But ... human error blasted this moon and so we have travelled the universe searching for a place to live . Now we can no longer live here and we go to face an uncertain future on the planet that has nearly destroyed us . who find this empty vessel of Alpha . Come and seek us out ... if we still exist . Come and teach us all you know we have learned ... that we still have much to learn . Alpha . A penny for them ? just wondering if there 's any future at all . Am I a prisoner ? You are free to walk where your mind has the will to take you . Am I free to walk out of here ? If your mind can find the way . John Koenig has taken your Eagle . He has called to Alpha for reinforcements . He believes he can rescue you and win space on this planet by force . Will he ? Will he succeed ? He is very much afraid that we will stop him . - Will you ? - No . off you go . - Head for the planet . I 'll brief you as we go . - Right . It looks like their defence is fully alert . Force field ! Closing down main motors ! - Fire retros ! - Full power ! There 's no going back ! Anti-gravity screens at maximum ! We can 't do it ! She 'll break up ! it 's our only chance ! She 's breaking up ! Eject ! Alan ! touch ... and feel . The tactile world around you now is a brain . this will never die . It has been developed over generations and grows with each life that 's lived in it . But why life and death if the brain is permanent ? We are not . We are but tenants of the brain for a span of a thousand years . The people on this planet feed the brains with life . like those of planet Earth . We have no fighting machines of our own . Why should we ? We have no fear . you used them to destroy Alpha . - Didn 't you ? - Mankind is full of fear . Come fearlessly into our brain and see . - Did you answer my question ? - Come . Our world is in perfect balance . Differences have been resolved . Restless desires of individual flesh and communal ambition are fulfilled and accommodated . They are as spiritual impulses in this great combination of brains that is our harmonious world . We have no fear . It 's beautiful . '97 minutes of life and then no oxygen . 'Hallucination . A slow and peaceful drift through dream to real eternity . 'Or just nothing . The ultimate negative . ' 'until nothing . 'for some future archaeologist to fit into an historical puzzle . from planet Earth . 'Ninth and last commander of Moonbase Alpha . John ... Come back ! He has faced death . He has conquered his fear . I want him back ... as he was . I want him here . I am afraid of death ! I don 't want your world ! If you bring him back he will have to face the agony of his own fear . I want him as he was ! With all his faults and fears ! He would destroy us all ! We are what we are ! John ! JOHN ! Helena ! Helena ! Helena ! Helena ! Helena . John ! we read you . ' Paul . ' Turn back ? ! 'Lf you 're gonna die you might as well die on Alpha . ' 20 seconds ... 15 seconds . John . - Still no signal ? - Nothing . - 10 seconds . - ' We can 't hold them ! ' - Alpha 's wide open . two ... - Alan ! Hold your fire ! - ' Commander ? ' That 's an order ! Alien contact ... lost . Commander ? ' Alan . Cancel red alert . Bob ? ' False alarm . Everybody relax . ' but ... does this mean we can go down to the planet ? 'No ! 'We trust you will stay away 'that you would destroy our perfect world . ' 'The spaceships that appeared to attack you 'were created in your own minds 'by your own fears . 'Our only defence was to make your fears appear real . ' 'Ln a moment of time we have shown you the possible consequences 'of a decision we hope you will not make . ' - I almost forgot ... - Forgot what ? I can 't remember . I remember a world without fear . It was very strange . Beautiful . We 've lost it .

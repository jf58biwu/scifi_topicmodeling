 'Sapphire ? ' 'Yes ? ' 'Silver is here with me . ' 'Good . ' 'He 's going to get us into the capsule - this one here . ' 'I understand . ' 'Sapphire ? ' - ' Silver ? ' - ' I 'll have to ... ' 'Silver says this is the governing one , 'where the power source lies . ' 'Silver 's right , of course . He always is . ' 'Tell me more about the crew of the second capsule . ' 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' 'Tell me about the crew . ' 'Come with me . ' 'How can I ? ' 'Just follow my voice . ' - ' But it 's a different ... ' - ' It 's the same layout . 'Just step into your hallway . ' How long ? Soon , very soon . As long as you 're back in here and she 's back in her communications room in , um ... four minutes ... and 32 seconds . Ah . Quite a work of art , isn 't it , hm ? But I suppose you 'll prefer something a little less decorative . Hm ? Something more ... coldly efficient . 'Are you through the door ? ' 'Yes . ' 'This is the downstairs hallway of a farmhouse . 'Now turn right and follow the corridor round . ' 'This capsule is disguised as just one floor of a farmhouse . 'None of the windows or doors are functional , everything is sealed . 'There 's no way in or out . 'The sun will have set in an hour or so here . 'What about there ? ' 'The same . ' 'It wasn 't an invasion force after all . 'Well , if it was , this crew wasn 't a part of it . ' 'What do you suppose they were doing ? ' - ' It was a survey team . ' - ' What were they surveying ? ' 'I don 't know , something harmless . 'The survival of the family structure into the 20th century . ' It turned out to be far from harmless . - ' Sapphire ! ' - ' Sorry . 'There 's something very strange just here . 'What was once glass or glass ornaments 'has become silicone dioxide , sodium carbonate and calcium oxide . ' 'Sand , soda ash and lime . ' 'Yes , the glass has reverted to its original silicate state . 'Anyway ... the crew . 'The main bedroom . 'There are five bodies - two adults and three children . ' 'Were they attacked ? ' 'No , I 'd say they that died by their own hand 'but something drove them to it , be sure of that . ' - ' Whatever 's in the main capsule ? ' - ' Yes , it 's responsible for this . ' - ' Sapphire ? ' - ' Yes ? ' 'In a few seconds , we 're going into that main capsule . ' - ' We could be too late again . ' - ' Still , we 're going in . 'There 's still the time force , that crystal , to be dealt with . 'Go back to the communications room right now . - ' There must be a screen in there . ' - ' Yes . ' - ' Is it activated ? ' - ' Yes , it is . ' 'Then go to that screen , stand by it and wait . 'Cos all three of us will be going in together at the same time . ' 'Yes , Steel ... Steel ... Steel ... ' 'Move now . ' 'No . 'Right hand . ' 'I 'm ready , Steel . I 'm ready to go in . ' Down just a little bit more ... Perfect ! - ' Steel ? ' - Tell her to stay near the screen . - You tell her . - Yes , why not ? 'Stay close to the screen , Sapphire . ' 'Something 's changed ! ' 'How do you mean , changed ? ' - ' Remember last time on the roof ? ' - ' Yes . ' - ' I sensed the child was gone - ' Yes . ' 'Well , now the two adults seem to have gone . ' - ' And the child ? - ' It 's still not in there . ' - ' Well , who is in there ? ' - ' The third one , the other adult . 'That 's all . That 's the only person left in the capsule . ' 'What about the power source , the crystal ? ' 'Nothing . It 's as if it 's dead . - ' I could always try to ... ' - ' No ! 'Whatever you do , don 't make contact with it again . - ' Are you ready ? ' - ' Yes , Steel . ' 'Because I think I know what it 's trying to do . ' - Right ? - It had better be quick . If it catches us halfway ... It wouldn 't need to . All it has to do is switch off that screen . How would you like to be transported 1,500 years into the future , hm ? Tell Sapphire it 's now . 'Now , Sapphire ! ' You see , we stopped receiving supplies of nutrition . Two days ago . No ! 'Porkers here , one , seven ... ' - You both came through there ? - Yes . - What happened ? - Just look at this place . - I said , what happened ? - We got in . There was a defensive time field , a sort of vacuum . - In that ? - Was it ? - This place is amazing . - Who set up this time field ? Whoever made the capsule - a security device . - The time source wasn 't involved ? - It had something to do with it . Sensory control , all very sophisticated . - Don 't touch anything . - Absolutely not . This must be one hell of a communications room . - I said don 't touch anything . - What is it , Steel ? If that time source was involved with the defensive field ... - It 's involved with everything . - It brought the capsules here . It was instrumental in bringing them . What would it have used to create that field ? Space ? No . Uh , no . Static space . It could have left us out there in time and space . Yes , it could have left us there indefinitely . Why didn 't it ? It 's been fighting us since we got here . - Why not this time ? - Then it would have the advantage . Yes . - Do we go back the same way ? - There 's no other way . Now , there 's a comforting thought . Sapphire ? L - I don 't quite understand , it hasn 't been burned and it hasn 't been cut . - What has happened to it ? - It 's lost its ... No , it 's never achieved its molecular structure . In other words , this part of the door has never existed . Zinc carbonate , pyrites of copper , and cellular tissue - plant tissue . The primary states of brass and wood . Do you mean something ... someone did that ? Yes . And whoever it was ... he was standing here , he was standing right here . When ? Not long before we arrived . So where are they now ? Somewhere . We 'd better locate it first . Look , I get you in , I get you out . I 'm a technician , not an explorer . - You want to wait here ? - Alone ? - No . - Wait . These are real , just like in the other capsule . But this isn 't . No bricks , no plaster work ... - Is it the same as the outside wall ? - Yes , it 's synthetic material . What about the people ? There 's still only one . - I could 've been wrong . - Wrong ? ! Yes , about the crew members . I could easily have been wrong . - My calculations could have ... - No . You were right the first time . Better ? Look . I told you . Sealed . There was a child in here . - How long ago ? - A few hours . And now ? Same sort of material as the outside wall , some kind of , um ... metal ? - Look . - Heavens , it 's all over the place . This happened in the other capsule . - What is it ? - You mean what was it ? It was glass . - When ? - A few hours ago . You mean ... like this ? - Nothing . - No ? Nobody . Not a soul . Where have they gone ? However ... There is something here , some kind of machine . - The time source ? - No , no , not that kind of power . Some sort of recording device or a transmitter , something like that . - Transmitting to where ? - Back to their base control . A base 1,500 years in the future ? Yes . What sort of signal would they need for that ? - Is it working now ? - No , it needs to be triggered . - I could get it to operate ... - I 'm sure you could . - And cause panic in the process . - Panic ? Back at base . What 's the first thing they might do if they heard strange voices ? Yes , recall the capsule . - Could you get us off in time ? - No . Steel ? It 's in here , in this room . - Well , it can 't be . - It ? Yes . Something ... - Someone . - You stay there . - Up there ? On that level ? - Yes . Where ? 'There ... there ... there . ' Come back down here , Sapphire . Sapphire ! Where are the others ? Where are the others ? Others ? The woman and the child , where are they ? There are no others . Do you know who we are ? Yes . And are you not surprised to find us in here ? Yes . 'Sapphire ? ' 'I can 't do an analysis , not from here . ' I need to be closer to him . 'No ! ' Tell us about your project . - Project ? - Yes , your reason for being here . I mean , you 're part of a ... a team , aren 't you ? Part of a survey team ... on a survey into the past . Yes . 'Prepare . ' Experimental project ES stroke five stroke treble seven . Urban examination and observation . All references according to old time and old calendar . Fine . Now , where are the others ? The other members of your team , where are they ? There are no others . There 's only me . Well , if that represents the future ... - He doesn 't . - But he does . In a way , he does . - How can that possibly ? - I don 't know . It 's some kind of future , I 'm just not sure ... His own future ? He represents ... his own future ? It 's time , it 's to do with time . - That 's a machine . I can fix ... - No , no ... - Don 't interrupt , Silver . - Come on . - You tried talking to it . - It 's human . - It can 't be . - Let Sapphire work it out ! Humans give answers , proper answers ! Machines don 't . We 're risking our lives in this contraption ! It is human . - You are human . - No , Sapphire , keep clear . But there 's something wrong . It 's at the beginning . It doesn 't know anything , doesn 't sense anything . I told you , it 's a machine ! No . It has no knowledge but it has a need . It depends on things . What things ? Warmth ... and sleep . It needs sleep and warmth ... and food ... and love . Steel , it 's a baby . - A baby ? - Yes . How old is it ? 10 , 12 weeks ? I 'm afraid you 've both fallen into the trap of attributing human characteristics to a flexible casing with circuits . They can easily program a machine to have a child 's mind , a child 's ... - Why would they do that ? - I don 't know why . But I can soon find out . I 'll open it up . No , you keep away from it . Look , Steel , Steel , Steel , Steel . I am the technician ... and there 's no machine - past , present or future - that I cannot handle .

 - Quiet , isn 't it ? . - Yes . Information . Forward sensors indicate Federation pursuit ships . Zen , strategy three , immediate operation . - Confirmed . - Battle stations . - Give me bearing and number of hostiles . - Battle computers will specify three seconds . - Activate the force wall . - Activated . - What 's happening ? . - Pursuit ships homing in . Get us moving . - Sensors indicate two hostiles bearing 1-3-7 - Cally . Distance five hundred spacials and closing . - Full boost , Jenna . - Full boost . - Two hundred spacials and closing fast . - Evasion course . Evasion course under way . Two plasma bolts launched and running . Changing course delta one vector two nine . [ PLASMAWHINE ] - Missed ! - Increase speed to standard by ten . Confirmed . Speed increased to standard by ten . - Blake , look . - Two more pursuit ships . - Bearing ... one seven five - Distance ? . - Four hundred spacials and closing . - We 're turning into them . I can see that . Compensating zero nine five . - Increase speed to standard by twelve . - Confirmed . - Plasma bolts launched and running . - They 're well off target . No threat . - I don 't call that off target . - Where the hell did that one come from ? . - Zen . Forward vision . - Four more ? . - Bearing ? . - Two seven zero . - Cally ? . - Four hundred spacials and closing . - Blake , We 're running out of room to manoeuvre . - They 're working to a pattern . Zen , are the battle computers ready to project all enemy positions ? . Affirmative . Computers ready . Blake , there 's a mass of ionised particles , vector three nine . If we can fly into it , it could confuse their scanners for just long enough . Avon might be right . Tangent one eight . Go for it . - Blake , at this speed even the smallest particle ... - Quench it , Jenna , full thrust . Tangent one eight . Full boost is on . Zen , nearest pursuit ship ? . Nine hundred spacials . Liberator is now out of detector range . - We 've outrun them . - Well done , Jenna . - I thought we 'd had it that time . - So did I. Cally , I could murder a relaxant . Any chance ? . It 's for medicinal purposes only . You know that . - This once ? . - Well , are you dying ? . I 'm thinking about it . - Has she picked us up yet ? . - No , commander . Good . Our detector shield is working . Give me her exact position in three minutes at present speed . Mark . - Computer running . - Commander to lead flotilla . Grid reference one zero seven three delta in two minutes twenty-three seconds . Mark . Attack in sections , Alpha section leads , thirteen seconds between waves . Speed , time distort ten . Now we 'll see what the Liberator is made of . - Two minutes . - She won 't get away a second time . - Do we join the action , Space Commander ? . - No . We just watch the execution . Federation pursuit ships registering on forward detectors now number twenty . - Twenty ? . - Oh no ! - Activate force wall three sixty . Energy reserves ? . - Switched in . - Activated . - Zen , relative position ? . - Liberator is cantered on all flight paths . - What course ? . Maintain course . Increase speed to standard by ten . - Zen , can we withstand an attack of this magnitude ? . - No information . Thank you , that 's very helpful . - Alpha section commencing attack run . - Excellent . This is what I 've been waiting for . Goodbye , Blake . - Four plasma bolts , launched and running . - Hang on , everybody . [ EXPLOSION ] They 've got her . And again . How many strikes now ? . - Five bolts , running true . - She 'll have to go . She 'll never resist this . [ EXPLOSION ] [ PLASMA FIRE ] It 's all right , Jenna , I 've got it . She 's getting away . Alpha section , return to the attack . Repeat , Alpha section , return to the attack . Blake , we 're losing them , I think . Forward vision is now clear . - Cally 's right . - But how ? . A too intricate attack pattern . Their trajectories were too precise . They couldn 't turn in time to match our forward velocity . Maintain course and speed . She 's flown right through us . How many hits registered ? . - Twelve . - What 's her damage ? . Cannot specify . But there must have been a heavy drain on the neutron energy banks . - How much our computer cannot determine . - What 's our course and speed ? . - One zero nine , time distort twenty . - Twenty ! Are you sure ? . Computer confirms . Then we can 't possibly catch her . And I thought we had them for sure . Used up half our energy reserves . Reading is forty-five percent of capacity . It was the biggest attack they 've mounted on us yet . We need time to recharge the banks , and ourselves . Zen , are we clear of pursuit ships ? . Affirmative . Liberator is now out of detector range . You said that last time . Avon , when are you going to repair that detector shield ? . Whenever we stumble across the parts I need . - Maybe we should give priority to getting them . - Yes , maybe we should . Looks as though the Federation have developed a shield themselves . Yes , well they got very , very close before we saw them . And that is the most depressing aspect of the whole affair . I was rather hoping to sell them the idea . [ CODED COMMUNICATION ] - Vila , come on , wake up Vila . - Unh . - That message , did you log it ? . - What message ? . - I thought I heard a call sign numerative . - Aw , it 's just Federation traffic I expect Orac 'll have it . Shall I ask him what it was ? . Orac , was that something ? . I thought I heard identification Exbar . Was it Exbar ? . Automaticmonitoring confirms . The message appears to be directed to you personally . - Me ? . - Have you decoded it ? . - Not yet . It is a non-standard cipher . - What was the origin of the message ? . Point of origin was the planet Exbar . The sender is aware of my unique intercept capability . Decode is now complete . Message carries a visplay . - Visp lay , Avon . - Zen , transfer visplay to main screen . Main screen transfer complete . Blake , I am sending from the planet Exbar . I have Ushton ' s daughter . Here she is . Her name is Inga , if you remember . Don 't worry , I won 't harm her . All I ask is come to Exbar and talk . Blake , this is not a trick . Like yourself , I am now a fugitive from the Federation . It is time we pooled our resources . Together we might survive . Alone the Federation will pick us off one at a time . - Starting with him , we hope . - He could have a point . Blake , the girl is safe if you come to Exbar within twenty-five time units . Teleport at grid reference B W 1 30 . If you do not come , the girl , regretfully , dies . - Who exactly is Inga ? . - She meant a lot to me once . - What about Ushton ? . - He 's my father 's brother . I thought he was dead . He ought to be dead ; he 's been a prisoner on that planet for years . Well , we didn 't see him , so perhaps he is dead . - I don 't know . - It 's a trap , of course . - Possibly . - What else could it be ? . - He did say together we might survive . - Don 't be stupid . Listen , I heard it as well as you did . He said we should pool our resources and I still say he may have a point . You turn your back on him you might find it between your shoulder blades . - That 's what you say . - Vila , he wants to kill us . He used to want to kill us . Now the Federation want to kill him . He 's in the same situation as us . - Are you sure you recognise this girl ? . - Yes . - You want to go to Exbar , don 't you ? . - Yes , I do . - Do you know the planet ? . - I visited it years ago , spent some time there . It was a penal colony then . Only grade four offenders , allowed visitors , special privileges , that sort of thing . - And now ? . - Abandoned , so I thought . You 're being irrational . That message , anybody could have picked it up . No . It was non-standard code . The Federation listening stations don 't use it . That is correct , isn 't it Orac ? . Correct . That code was destandardised for general Federation trafficfifty years ago . - Thank you , Orac . - T ravis hates you , and all of us . He wants to kill us . What can he possibly offer us ? . I don ' t know . You believe his story about our needing each other against the Federation ? . - No . - Well , then . You heard him ; he 's got the girl . Do you believe that he won 't kill her ? . - No . - That 's why I want to go to Exbar I don 't expect any of you to come with me ; I just want you to put me down , that 's all . You just want us to put you down and that is all you ask ? . - Yes - Well , if that 's all ... You 're being naive , all of you . Vila ? . - Well , she has got a pretty face . - Right . No . I still say that it is an unacceptable risk . It is not unacceptable because I accept it . I want to save that girl , if I can . If I can 't , I might as well be a Federation slave like everyone else . As might you all . Zen , lay in a course for the planet Exbar . What do you mean , your force lost him ? . Your orders were to destroy Blake . We got close , Supreme Commander , but the Liberator stood the attack . - Did you damage her ? . - We must have . - Where is she now ? . - I don ' t know . I 've put all patrol units in sector four on full alert . Commander , I 'm not interested in your excuses . You will surrender your ship and place yourself under close arrest . - But , Supreme Commander , I must protest . - Mutoid . We did very well to get close to the Liberator . It could have worked ! [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Yes ? . - Communications section . We 've just received a rather odd signal . It 's in top priority general code one Zero seven and it 's tagged for your personal attention . - For me ? . By name ? . - Yes , Supreme Commander . - Have you decoded it ? . - Not yet . - What is the origin of the message ? . - Unspecified . No Federation code sign was given . - Decode at once . - And Councillor Joban is here . Send him in . - Councillor Joban . - Supreme Commander . - An honour , Councillor . - Thank you . Aren 't you going to offer me a drink ? . Yes , of course . Not joining me ? . - I prefer to keep a clear head . - Very wise . - Personally , I like the edges a little blurred . - I wish I could believe that . - Softened , then . - I find that even less likely . - It failed , then ? . - I knew you were well informed , but ... All that logistical output , and it failed . It almost succeeded . " Almost succeeded " is not really good enough , is it ? . Did I suggest that it was ? . Some members of the council are concerned that many of our citizens now know of Blake 's activities , and those of the renegade T ravis . But there have been no public space casts on either T ravis or Blake . People talk , Servalan . There 's no way of stopping them . This is a major breach of security . The punishment is total . Who are these people who have been talking ? . I want their names , Councillor . All sorts of citizens from Alphas to labour grades know of Blake 's defiance of the Federation . They talk of him as a sort of ... hero , many of them . What rubbish . His men impede progress , and more importantly order . Order , Servalan . It is all that matters . I do not need you to remind me of that . I supported your appointment . Perhaps I was wrong . Perhaps you were . There 's a first time for everything , Joban . - I 've always admired your willingness to take risks . - Calculated risks . - I add up to a dangerous enemy . - Mmmmmm . So do I , Councillor . The council ask , " Where is Blake 's head ? " And we 've no answer . - You shall have it . - The answer , or his head ? . - Both . - Good . I would not like to think I might have been wrong in my choice . - Can I offer you another ... - Thank you , no . - I must try to emulate your clarity of thought . - I value our friendship . - Goodbye , Supreme Commander . - Goodbye , Councillor Joban . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Yes ? . - The message reads , " Travis is on the planet Exbar " - Is that all ? . - That is all , but communications have now established that its origin was somewhere in the fourth sector . We can ' t be more specific . The fourth sector . Where was Blake 's Liberator when it was attacked ? . - Supreme Commander ? - Do we have a command ship available ? . C-26 has just returned . Good . Put it on readiness and plot me a course for Exbar . The atmosphere on Exbar is breathable , but the envelope is narrow and oxygen begins to run out at relatively low altitudes . The terrain supports minimum vegetation , which becomes increasingly sparse at higher altitudes . Near the top of the chalk escarpments , which are a feature of the area specified , the air is dangerously thin . So , it 's very cold down there and you ' ll be short of oxygen on the higher ground . So move slowly and conserve your energy . Better still , don 't go at all . At least don 't go alone , not again . Let one of us go down with you . - Are you volunteering ? . - Me ? . - Thanks for the offer anyway . - Wait . Why ? . We 're approaching orbit . At least let me make sure that there are no Federation pursuit ships around . - Why should there be ? . - Why shouldn 't there be ? . - Zen , any sign of a pursuit ship ? . - Negative on main detectors . Satisfied ? . What happens if they arrive while you 're down there ? . - Then you 'll have to leave me down there . - That could happen . I know . What 's the matter with you , Avon ? . I 'm just reminding you , that 's all . You are still assuming we will risk our lives for you . Liberator is now moving into stationary orbit over planet Exbar . I 'm going to get ready . Vila . Just think what we 're missing on Exbar . All that cold and shortage of breath . - Cally , what 's the matter ? . - No . I ... I don 't think it 's important . Well , it might be . You 've been right before . No , leave it , it 's nothing . Down safely . I seem to remember the place from when I was a boy . There 's an old pathway going up a slope . I think I 'm near the right place . I 'm moving off now . It 's not safe , staying in orbit like this . We 're a sitting target . Well , there should be no danger . Does anyone know we 're here ? . Avon ? . - What ? . - I said who knows we 're here ? . How do I know who knows ? . I still say anybody could have picked up that message . No they couldn 't . You know they couldn 't . - Why are you so worried ? . - Why don 't you get on with your job ? . - What 's all that about ? . - I 've no idea . Ushton ? . Ushton . - Who are you ? . - Roj . Roj Blake . Roj Blake ? . Roj ! - It 's good to see you again . - You 've grown . - It 's been a long time . - Yes , I suppose it has . - Where is T ravis ? . - T ravis . Well , we 'll get to him later . First , I must take you to a fire , and under cover . - You 're limping . - Yes , I broke my leg last winter , fell down a crevasse . Inga got me out . - Isn 't there anyone else around here to help you ? . - No . They 're all too busy trying to stay alive . T rying to get enough to eat . - Federation . - The Federation They leave us alone now . Nothing else they want on Exbar . Hmph . Well , good to see you . Come on . Here we are . - That 's my dugout . - Where ? . There . Come on . - I 'm going down . - What ! I said I 'm going down . Vila , come and operate the teleport . - Did you hear that ? . - Yes , but I don 't believe it . Why ? . - Blake may need some help . - And that concerns you ? . - But you 've been against it all until now . - I know , but I 'm still going down . Vila ? . - You know what all this is about , don 't you ? . - I think I can guess . - It is a trap , isn 't it ? . - Avon thinks so . - Well , Avon always thinks so . - This time he feels responsible . - Well , why should Avon feel responsible ? . - There can only be one reason . Thank you . Tell me about T ravis . Oh , he turned up here six days ago with men and guns . - How many men ? . - Four . Crimos . Crimos ? . Well , I 've never seen them before but that 's what they were , all right . - Criminal psychopaths . - So I hear . - You know what they can do , don 't you ? . - Mm . - And they have Inga . - Yes . Well , T ravis seems to have them well in hand . He said he doesn 't want to hurt her . - He just wants you to join him up there . - Do you believe him ? . I had no choice . He had the crimos and the guns . He took us by surprise . His ship must have landed on the lower plain . So , where is he now , do you know ? . Yes , he 's in the tower at the top of the escarpment . It 's an old communications centre , deserted , but it 's still got an oxygen plant and the power to run it . - Why didn 't you go after him ? . - Oh , absolutely impossible . - With this leg I couldn 't even get up there . - Mm . - How did you come to hear about all this ? . - T ravis sent me a summons . - Summons ? . - Yes . Said come , or he 'd kill the girl . - So you came . - What else could I do ? . - What does he want ? . - To talk , so he says . More likely to kill me . You knew that and you still came . That was good of you . - So , how do I get up there ? . - I 'll show you . I should go up the back trail . Come at them from behind . Surprise them . Oh , by the way , how do I get into this tower ? . - Well there 's only one door . - Yes , I was afraid of that . [ FOOTSTEPS ] Right . Now , just go up here and you 'll see a ridge . Climb the ridge and you 'll find the tower . Oh , take this . It 's quieter than that thing . I 'll manage . Good luck , Roj . [ SCANNER ] Jenna , send Vila down , I need him . Adjust coordinates to 0-2-4-6 . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] He 's on his way up . I know . I saw him . He 's coming up . The back trail . Did you hear that , Inga ? . Your champion is coming to rescue you . He 's very gallant , your Blake . Foolish , too . All right Molok . - Get him . - I think my crimos are going to enjoy this . - You 're going to kill him . - Don 't worry ; I won 't kill him , yet . - Estimated time to Exbar ? . - Planetfall will be at 2 1 : 59 standard . Are we at full capacity ? . We are calculating at time distort nine . That is our safety maximum . I thought this ship was capable of time distort ten ? . - That is the emergency maximum . - This is emergency , time distort ten . Yes , Supreme Commander . Time distort ten . Mutoids . Don 't you ever question anything ? . This is not our function . Our function is to obey without question . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Computer reports message from councillor Joban . - Ignore it . - It is from headquarters , Supreme Commander . - I said , ignore it . - It is directed to this ship . - Is it directed to you ? . - No . - To whom is it directed ? . - To you . - And I said ignore it . Understood ? . - Understood . - Now Vila , have you got everything ? . - Yes , I think so . - Have you checked your thermal suit ? . - Uh , yes . Right then . Let 's go . You know Zen said it was cold down there . Shouldn 't I have some more clothes on ? . - No . - What about a hand warmer ? . Vila . Quiet . Listen , there 's a man in that cave . Do you think you can keep an eye on him ? . I suppose so . I 've got my gun . Don 't use it unless you have to . Is that the old man , Blake 's uncle or whatever ? . - Yes , it is . I don 't trust him . - Why not ? . When he saw Blake go , he had a limp . When he went back into the cave , he didn 't . - Perhaps he 's a fast healer . - I think Blake 's in trouble I 'm going after him ; you stay . If the old man tries to go up the trail , stop him . - How ? . - Kill him . - Oh , marvellous . Kill Blake 's old uncle . - Keep under cover . - Yes , yes . - Stay alert . Talk to the Liberator every ten minutes . - Yes , yes . I 'm freezing . - Well , freeze in silence . - Blake , this is Avon . Where are you ? - Hold on , Avon . Blake , this is Avon . Respond . Respond . Blake . Where the hell is he ? . - Avon , are you all right ? . - I can 't contact Blake . He 's up the trail somewhere . Have you heard from Vila ? - No . - I told him to report in . - I 'll try and contact him now . - All right . I 'm going on . Out . Vila , come in please . Vila . Vila . [ COMMUNICATION CHIME ] - Who are you ? . - Chilly isn 't it ? . Of course , I don 't want to hurt you ; son , but you leave me little alternative . - I thought that you were Blake 's uncle . - I am . I also happen to be Inga 's father and T ravis has Inga so I do as I 'm told , don 't I ? . - You tricked Blake into coming here , or helped to . - Well , I had to . - Well , it 's been ... very , very nice meeting you . - Just a minute For the last time , are you the only one to come down from that ship , or are there others ? . - Only me , I swear . - Swear ? . Yeah . When people swear I have to ask myself why they are swearing ? . Is it because they want me to believe them when they 're telling me a lot of rubbish ? . Now are you telling me the truth , son ? . Because if you 're not ... - Ah , Blake . Come in . Welcome . - Some welcome . Sit down . You know your cousin Inga , of course . She and her father have been looking forward to meeting you again . - I 'm sorry , Roj . - Are you all right ? . Don 't believe anything he tells you . My father would never do the things he says . You 're wrong , Inga . You should listen to me . I am the only one you can trust . He says my father has betrayed you . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Two more ? . You will ? . Good . Thank you , Ushton . Inga , that was your father . He is being very cooperative . - He wouldn 't spit on you . - Two more coming up the trail . Go and get them . Now , Blake , you and I have business , I believe . I can 't think what . I am tired of being hunted by Servalan and the Federation . Sooner or later I shall be cornered . My problem is , I want the Liberator . I see . Yes , of course . It is the fastest and most powerful ship in existence . - Not a chance , T ravis . - We 'll see . Jenna , this is Avon . I 'm up near the plateau . Anything from Vila ? . No communication with Vila at all . Something is very wrong . I don 't know , I think Ushton must be ... Avon . Avon , are you all right ? . Come in , please . Come in , please . Avon , are you all right ? Come in , Avon . Can you hear me ? [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Wait . Get that bracelet . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] - Sorry . - On . I said I wouldn 't give you the Liberator , T ravis , and I won 't . But I think you 're probably right : together we stand more chance than operating as single units . I am prepared to do a deal with you . Most cooperative of you , Blake , since you have no choice . Bring her back . Futile gesture . The girl 's a fool She actually wants to die . Can you understand that Blake ? . - Can you ? . - Oh yes , I understand shame very well . Now , you were telling me about your change of heart . About sharing the Liberator . Pity , I was beginning to enjoy it . - You wanted to die , Inga . Why was that ? . - You wouldn 't understand . So that Blake would not hate your father ? . But he does . - I do not hate him . - Ushton betrayed you . You must hate him ; I would in your place . That is the difference between us , T ravis . That , too . Take him in there . Blake , come in please . Avon ? . Vila ? . Nothing . - Of course it 's a trap . Let 's go down . - No , we 'll wait . - For what ? . - It 's T ravis 's move . We still control the Liberator . - A sitting target . - Not for him . - Not for anybody . - Where are you going ? . I 'm going to clear the neutron blasters for firing , - Well , what are you going to fire at ? . - Anything that moves . Now you 've got all three . So let me have my daughter . - Wait . - You promised . - Father . - Leave her alone . Old man , don 't be difficult . She was ashamed of you . She tried to run away . I may be an old man , but if you cheat me , T ravis ... Why should I ? . I 've got Blake in there ; now I 've got the other two . You kept your part of the bargain . It 'll be dark before long and you can take your daughter down in the morning . - All right ? . - All right . - Why did you do it ? . - I had to . - No you didn 't , Father . - He would have killed you , Inga . - I would rather he had . - Take them in there . - I thought you wanted to do a deal with us , T ravis ? . - I 've changed my mind , Avon . - And you believed him . - How was I to know he 'd change his mind ? . - Nice of you to drop in . - The old man betrayed us . - I know . - I won 't say that I told you so . - Thank you . - At least we are still alive . - For the time being . - What does that mean ? . These gentlemen do not mean us well , or haven 't you noticed ? . - Why should they want to kill us ? . - Because they enjoy it . All we can hope for is that it 's quick . - Who is the weakest ? . - What do you want to know for ? . - Who is the weakest ? . - Don 't help them anymore , Father . - The one they call Vila . - Vila . Bring him out . Leave the other two in there . Seal off the door . What are you doing ? . You 're going to kill them , aren 't you ? . What else do you think I was going to do with Blake you old fool ? . - You . - Me ? . - You . - Now wait a minute . Let 's not be hasty . There 's no need for violence , is there ? . - So what happens now ? . - They turn off the air and we suffocate ? . You 're going to help me , Vila . How do these things work ? . I don 't know . One of the others always does it for me . - I 'm not very good with technical things . - Don 't play the idiot with me . You 're going to kill us anyway so why don 't you get on with it ? . What are you doing ? . Now you see Molok has a bracelet on . All you have to do is talk . Demonstrate . Tell us the word . I 'm saying nothing . The word . Tell us the word . - Teleport . - I 'm sorry , we didn 't hear the word , did we Molok ? . - I 'm not helping you , never . - Now , for the last time , tell us the word . The Word . The Word . Switch the bracelet on . The Word . The Word . The Word . TELEPORT ! I told you TELEPORT ! Jenna , did you hear that ? . Yes , it sounds as though Vila 's in trouble . I 'm teleporting him now . I 'll be with you . Don 't move . Keep away from those switches . Who are you ? . What do you want ? . You are Jenna . What is the state of the ship ? . We 're in stationary orbit . We 're on automatic . You will fly the ship for T ravis . Wait . Over there . Quick . You are Cally . - Yes . - What 's happened to our friends ? . - They 're dead . - What ? . - I don ' t believe it . - Show me the ship ; I must learn about it . - You ' re a crimo , aren ' t you ? . - I have a high intelligence quotient , but I enjoy inflicting pain , in that I am a true crimo . So don 't be stupid , do as I say . Show me the flight deck . No . If you kill us , you won 't be able to fly this ship on your own . I 'll take that chance . Will you ? . Move . - What happened ? . - They teleported one of the crimos to the Liberator . - You told them how to do it - No , I didn 't ! T ravis tricked me . That wouldn 't be too difficult . So , now they have the Liberator . - What have I done to deserve this ? . - How long a list would you like ? . - Leave him alone , there 's no point . - Blake , listen . - Sit down . Don 't talk . Save oxygen . - Listen . I sent a message to Space Command Headquarters , to Servalan , that T ravis was here . You did what ? . I set the dogs on T ravis . What 's so strange about that ? . - Why ? . - It seemed the only rational thing to do . I thought they would get there ahead of us , get T ravis and save us the trouble . - So this all your fault . - How do you arrive at that conclusion ? . I 'd still be on the ship if it weren 't for you . Shut Up . We must conserve the air for as long as possible . - How long have we got ? . - Minutes . - How many ? . - I 'll let you know . Wait . T urn round . You were wise to cooperate . You . You and I are returning to the planet . You will stay here . When we come back , we 'll have T ravis with us . If you try to move the ship or cause any kind of trouble , she 'll be dead . Now put us down . Wait . Put your bracelet on . Operate the controls . Do it . I will count to three , then I 'll kill you . One . Two . - Where did you send him ? . - Into space . There won 't be much left of him by now . - Information . - What is it Zen ? . Main detectors indicate a single federation pursuit ship-approaching planet Exbar . I know they 're still alive . We 've got to go down and try and find them . Get my bracelet and the guns . Zen , how long before the pursuit ship 's planetfall ? . - Fifteen minutes . - How long before her detectors pick us up ? . - Twelve minutes . - We can 't go down if that 's all the time we 've got . That pursuit ship may be alone , or it could be the first of a flotilla . Either way , all we can do is wait . - I 'm dying . - Not yet . Soon . T ravis , let us out . We 'll drive the Liberator for you . - I like to hear you scream for mercy , Vila . - You 'll never fly her on your own . You underestimate my crimos . They can fly my ship , why not yours ? . - T ravis , please . - T ravis . She 's run off . Get her ! Inga ! Get them out of there . I 'll deal with T ravis . - Ohhh . - What 's the matter with you ? . Pins and needles . - Blake , you fit ? . - Just about . - Let 's get them before they get us . - Ohhh . Ohhh . - Come on , Vila . - I don 't think I can make it . - Inga , stay and look after him . - Blake , come on . - You all right ? . - I 'm not sure . Oh ! - Where does it hurt ? . - Everywhere . That way . Crimos ! Crimos ! Forget the girl ! The prisoners are free . Come on , this way . Follow me . Come on . That 's one gone . I 'll get the other two , you get T ravis . - You 're unarmed . - I 'll manage . Crimos ! Crimos ! [ LASERON BLAST ] [ EXPLOSION ] [ GUNFIRE ] [ DISTANT EXPLOSION ] [ GUNFIRE ] [ LASERON BLAST ] - How bad is it ? . - I don 't know . - Let me look . - Leave me . Watch yourself . - We 've got to get you back to the Liberator . - Leave me ! - Come on . - Don ' t move . - Still no deal , T ravis - I 'm not going to bargain with you , Blake . I 'm going to kill you . Two for the price of one . Get him . Why don 't we kill him while we still have the chance ? . No . We 'll leave him for the Federation . - You badly hurt ? . - I 'll survive . That is your way .

 A sun like ours . planet Ariel with its atmosphere . It 's a perfecty balanced little solar system . If we go into orbit , what does that do to your sense of symmety ? If we go into orbit I shan 't care about symmety ! providing the planet proves to be as well endowed as Computer predicts . - ' Main Mission . ' - ' Come in , Alan . ' planet Ariel 's atmosphere looks like pea soup from here . It is ! The oxygen content is more than four times that of Earth . Monitor Eagle surface temperature on entering the atmosphere . Heat shields at maximum . Stand by to fire your retros in thirty seconds . Computer 's flight plan for the descent to the surface . - No problems ? - No problems . put it through the on-board computer , would you ? ( Beeping ) Scanner contact . Alien object approaching . Alien object closing fast . It 's homing on me ! It 's some kind of missile . I can 't shake it off . ( Silence ) Alan ? Alan ? we 're alive , Commander . It hasn 't gone off . It 's just attached itself . Eagles 2 and 7 return to Base . Evacuate all personnel from Launch pad 1 . Ready Crash Unit . - Approaching now for final descent . - ' All right . 'we won 't risk it , we 'll bring you in on auto . 'Eagle 7 , stand clear . 'Alan , pad 1 is sealed off . ' As soon as you land , skip touchdown procedures and get clear . Fine , Commander . So far it hasn 't made a move . My guess is it won 't . At least not until you bring it home . All right , paul , bring him in . ( Beep ) 'Victor , what do you get on the scanners ? ' Nothing . Can 't get any readings at all . 'Density ? 'Radiation ? ' The object resists any remote-anaysis technique we have . 'we 'll have to bring it in . ' An intelligent civilisation with an atmosphere like Earth 's sees Earthmen approaching and tries to prevent them . Creating a diversion and continuing mystey does just that , plausible ? Yes ... But why ? Maybe to gain time , to find out more about us . And to prevent us finding out anything about them . Let the professor play with it . Let 's not waste more time on that planet . If we go into orbit , we 'll have plenty of time . we don 't know if we 're going into orbit , let alone if this is friendy . Even if it is an invitation card , we 'd better play this step by step . - Anything so far , Victor ? - Not much . weight , 4-28 . Diameter , 86 centimetres . Temperature , ambient . Radiation , zero . Composition ... still unknown . - Inert ? - Totaly . gas ! Helena , prepare for casualties . Victor , anayse that gas now . paul , Red Alert . Evacuate and seal off Technical Section . Then open its surface airlocks . Come on . ( Alarm ringing ) Technical Area sealed off and ventilated . good. kano , can Computer assess the capacity of that object ? At the present rate of expansion , not less than infinite . pressure in Technical was up by 80 before we activated the airlocks . Diameter under a metre . weight , 4-28 . That 's impossible . So it 's made its move ? Commander ! we 're being invaded . 'john , john ! 'It 's air ! That thing 's brought us air . ' Red sunrise . Blue sky . An atmosphere . we 've got an atmosphere . gravity 's increasing . By the time we go into orbit it 'll be like Earth 's . kano , has Computer anaysed my data yet ? Computer 's telling us nice stories today ! - Computer never ... - .. tells stories . john ... So far so good . I can ony test for elements we can identify , there may be things that don 't register . And your concern about ultra-violet ? The atmosphere thins off rapidy at 20,000 . 0n Earth , that 's not enough to act as a filter . But here ... I think we 'll be all right . But the final test is to breathe it , right ? And live in it . Attention , eveyone . Dr Russell is satisfied from her processed data that the atmosphere out there is breathable and safe . what I 'd like is two volunteers to go out and make sure . Sandra , paul . Remember , it 's the final stage of a scientific test . It 's not a joyride . However , kano , I 'd also like you to run a check on their joy levels . Airlock pressure equalised with atmosphere . Confirmed . You 're clear to move out . You 're now breathing more air than oxygen . The pressures inside and outside your suit are equal . How do you feel ? - ' I feel fine . ' - ' My pulse rate 's increasing . ' Yes , I noticed . Chalk that up to the excitement . Smells vey good . - ( Helena ) ' Like what ? ' - Like county air . ( Laughter and chatter ) 0h ! we 'll have to wory about draughts . Exchanging one set of problems for another ! I 'm having trouble calculating our seasonal variations , but just instinctivey I 'd say it was spring . Away from Alpha . Away from sensors , monitors and computers . we 've done the longest tour of duty ever . we deserve a break . ( paul ) Not exacty home . ( Sandra ) I am happy with anything that gets me out of Alpha . It makes you look at things in a different light . Sunlight ? No , more than that . If this is the end of one life ... we have to start to build a new one . To live like human beings again . Do you know which earthy sound I miss most in the silence of space ? Birdsong ? In there , cooped up ... there are thoughts that we can 't allow ourselves to think . If we go into orbit , this old moon could become our new Earth . we could build outside Alpha , fertilise the dust and raise crops . - All we need is a rainfall . - we can make that . The air 's so humid we just have to start the cycle with cloud-forming cystals . It took 25 years to reclaim the Sahara desert . 0ut there is a planet that already supports a civilisation . 0ur priority has to be to establish whether it can support us . ( Thunder roars ) Tomorrow we 'll build a swimming pool . we 'll build a new Alpha ! The cycle 's begun . The Sea of Tranquillity will become a genuine sea . All the craters will become circular lakes . It 'll be a beautiful new world . wait a minute ! How long will it take ? How long will it rain ? Victor . Those circular lakes will look wonderful but Alpha is built in a crater . If it rains as hard as you hope it will , at the bottom of one of those lakes will be Moonbase Alpha . This expedition will be commanded by Dr Russell . Her brief is straightforward . we 've been combing the universe searching for a new Earth and suddeny , thanks to our mysterious friends , we 've found it . Right here , under our vey noses . The job for these people is to find the best place in which to live . So that we may begin our new life , our new future . I 'd like you to wish them good luck . Yes . Take care of yourselves . - good luck . Come back soon . - goodbye . Nice heavy rain cloud forming over the Taurus mountains . Fine . Not much evidence of rainfall . How are you feeling ? Airsick . That 's why I opted for the space programme . This data transmitter 's acting like a primitive cystal set . Computer can 't read this . There 's too much interference . we 've used all the filters . They must be fying in an electrical storm . The atmosphere 's not all good . It is for me . Communications are bad . we 're back to the static of Earth . Now we 're realy fying . Hello Alpha , this is Eagle 28 . There 's severe turbulence near the Taurus mountains . I 'm going over the top . Come in , Eagle 28 . we 're not receiving you , 28 . If you can hear me , your orders are to return to Base now . we 're in trouble . Come in , this is Eagle 28 . Do you read me ? keep tying . - ( kano ) Come in , Eagle 28 . - I want their exact position . we 're losing power . - Main boosters . - Boosters ... Malfunction . - Back up power . - Malfunction . All systems out . Crash positions . ( kano ) Come in , Eagle 28 . Eagle 28 , come in . Eagle 28 , do you copy ? Eagle 28 , come in . Eagle 28 ? Eagle 28 , come in . Contact lost with on-board computer . Eagle 28 , come in , Eagle 28 . Eagle 28 , do you copy ? Eagle 28 , come in . I want all Eagles fuelled and ready for liftoff . photographs , eveywhere within 500 miles of their last position . Divide the sector into 28 zones . - Mathias . - ' Yes , Commander ? ' Load Eagle 1 with rescue equipment . You 're coming with me . Eagle 9 to pad 1 . Eagle 12 to pad 3 . Eagle 24 to pad 5 . Eagle 19 to pad 1 . Lift off Eagle 12 . Elevator locked on pad 4 . Clear to go , Eagle 14 . 14 to Main Mission , we have ignition . And liftoff . Main Mission to Eagle fleet . wind is southwestery at 2-1-0 and falling to strength 3 . Dust is still a problem over the search area but ... good luck . No , no . Let 's not move her yet . She has severe concussion . with concussion you can never tell . If there are no complications , she 'll be all right . Evey transistor , evey condenser , all of them are blown . The lightning must have blown out evey circuit in the ship . That means we 're dependent on Alpha to find us . paul ... why don 't you give Alan a hand getting us some air . She 'll be all right . Look , we 've got enough food to last us a fortnight . About 30 gallons of drinkable water in the tanks . And there 's 27 serviceable Eagles at the Base . I 'll lay you even money finding us is a piece of cake . Come on . we 're directy over the last point of radar contact . ( koenig ) Not much of a new world , is it ? Not much of a place to be lost in . Doctor . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Some camouflage , eh ( ? ) They 're never gonna see us here . Hey ! we 're here ! we 're here , come back . Come back . News ? They 've run out of daylight . The last Eagle is returning to Base . Refuel them immediatey . john . It 's looking promising . The moon 's curving in towards an orbital station around our new sun . The gravitational influence will increase to a high point which we 'll reach in eight days . with a 50-50 chance of going into orbit , right ? - It 's ... - If we don 't go into orbit the conditions on that surface will deteriorate rapidy . Also right . How many times has a man got to shift before he gets some breakfast ? protassic acid . Tanks have smashed and it 's eaten into eveything . Food , medical supplies ... and the water . why was it stored near the food ? It wasn 't . The impact must have carried it into the cargo section . we 're lucky it didn 't explode . - Lucky ? It 's ... - Come on , Alan . Take it easy . we 've still got survival rations . 0h , yeah . About half a drop of uncontaminated water. great ( ! ) It 's 120 degrees in the shade out there . what will that do to Sandra with a high fever ? She needs plenty of water . You make sure the next time they fy over they can see us . Let 's get this gear outside . we 've got to make a marker . Eagle 15 has grounded , Commander . - grounded ? - Seizure of the lateral stabilisers . So far five Eagles have reported similar faults . Look , kano , we can 't afford faults . we drifted through space for ages and those technicians had nothing to do . Now I need all the Eagles and half of them go lame . get those technicians moving , kano . get them moving ! No Eagle is grounded until I say so . Now go on ! They 're breaking their necks down there . So they should . You have to face it that we may not find them at all . we 've got to find them , Victor . we 've got to . She 'll die out here . 120 degrees by day and freezing by night . You rooted hard for that crazy idea of settling out here , instead of the planet Ariel . No one knew you 'd fy into a cloud for your kicks . Come on , let 's save our energy . Make that three . paul and I will share one . If we don 't survive , Sandra won 't make it . There must be something we can do . Like walk ? Nice liftoff , Commander . No malfunctions indicated . kano , stop him . For heaven 's sake stop him ! Bring him back . ( Alarm ) Doesn 't anything function on this Base ? well ? Something we don 't know about in the atmosphere coupled with incessant fying through fine particles caused rapid corrosion , the system just seized . Evey Eagle is affected ? Yes . But parts coated with a graphite compound won 't corrode . How long to strip down one Eagle and graphite the parts ? Three days . They 've started already . They 'll have to do it in two . I don 't know if this is friend or foe but get it out of here . You 're getting better . You 're going to be all right . I thought we had found our home . we will. we will . - But ... - Shh , shh . I 'll find you some more to drink . Here . Has it rained ? Yes , it 's rained . paul ? Sandra ? where 's paul ? gone to fetch water . paul ! paul ! paul . paul said it had rained . He did ? 0h , yes . was it much ? No , not realy. just ... more of a promise of things to come . Home . The new city of Alpha . You 'll be cooler here when the sun 's up . It gets the breeze . - Thank you , paul . But I ... - we 've found our home . we 're the first Earthmen . This is our garden of Eden . To begin the human race all over again . It 's a nice thought , paul . You 're a regular pioneer. where 'd you get the steam to be up all night ? Breakfast ? - what is it ? - Manna . Food from heaven . 0r perhaps from the people on Ariel , if you prefer . wait , where did it come from ? 0ver there , under the rocks . It 's growing like mushrooms . we have no way of anaysing it , of testing it. we can 't ... But I 've already tested it . You 've eaten it ? - Sandra ? - Not yet. we were waiting for you . The change in Sandra 's condition is born of hope . But man shall not live by hope alone . paul . we have to be careful . It doesn 't seem to have done him any harm . He put all this up over night , he must have got the strength somehow . The way I see it is , it 's no accident that the moment I lie down to die this stuff literaly appears in front of my nose . It could be months before they find us out here . Evey time we clear a signal area , the dust covers it again . Maybe we 'll never even see another Eagle . Yesterday we were dying without hope , today we not ony have hope but sustenance as well . I say don 't knock it , Doc . There 's no alternative . we either eat it ... or die . Look , let 's stick to the ration cubes for breakfast , while I do what tests I can . Then if it 's all right , and you 're still all right , - we 'll all ty it . - How long will that take ? Lunchtime . Hey , just in case it is 0k , I 'm going mushrooming . john , if you want to look at it that much you shouldn 't have moved it . You don 't have to tell me , that phoney cheerfulness tells me . we 're not going into orbit , right ? Er , well , no . we should have gone to the planet after all . Somehow I don 't think I 'd like the people . - They gave us air . - Right . which will turn into an icecap when we pass beyond the sun 's warmth . And Alpha will be crushed to death . what 's happening with the corrosion-proof Eagle ? Ready to go . - ' Nice liftoff , Commander . ' - No problems here , kano . we 're clearing Alpha now on 2-4-0 . And we shall build farms first , then will come the roads and the streets . Slowy the community will have a heart . An urban heart of great buildings . It 'll be the capital of our new civilisation . I 'm not sure that it 's safe , but I think maybe we should ty it . - 0f course ! - I 'll test more when we get back . we 're not going back . we 're staying right here to begin our new life . None of this happened by chance . we are given an atmosphere . A freak electrical storm and we 're cut off . A freak dust storm buries us . Near starvation and food is sent from the heavens . 0h , no . The people of that planet have a sense of purpose . And I believe we have one now . This land will flow with milk and honey , we will build and settle and raise children , we 'll multipy . Like the people from peru , who spread the human race across the pacific so we will launch forth into space and spread humanity from solar system to solar system . That was sacred bread , Alan . That was sent to us in our time of need . paul , wait a minute ... pick it up . You ... would come between me and my destiny ? No one shall stop me ... No one . paul ... No ... No . ( Low whining ) Look , Dr Russell . The people from Ariel are here again . It is a second coming . Atmospheric pressure 's falling rapidy . I 'm not surprised . Those satellites are back . Commander , 15 degrees left . Spacesuits - the atmosphere 's thinning fast . No time . Take her . Commander , I 'm all right . It 's Sandra , she needs help . She 's in a shack over there . - Sandra ? - Leave her alone ! - There 's no time . - I said , leave her . we have laid the foundation stone of mankind 's future . Sandra and I. Sandra , come on . what we have is a food substance amazingy rich in protein and many of the essential vitamins . we could grow limitless crops , once we 've removed all the hallucinating elements . I 'm sory I didn 't discover that sooner . I 'm not ! It wasn 't a bad trip . Except for the ending . It 's times like that you find out who your friends are . Commander , there 's movement on the alien object . Let 's see it . - It 's leaving us . - The sooner the better . 'we were neither benevolent nor malevolent , Commander koenig . '0ur absolute need was to prevent you 'from penetrating the atmosphere of our planet . 'So we gave you what you wanted 'in the hope that you would not further disturb us . ' - Can you hear me ? - ' And understand your thoughts . ' Then you must have known we came in peace . 'we believe your intentions 'but we have been watching the progress of your world 'since the beginning of time . 'Human nature is such that we could not afford to take the risk . '

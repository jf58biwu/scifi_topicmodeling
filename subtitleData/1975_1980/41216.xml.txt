 VISUAL ... TACTICAL , STAND BY ON TORPEDOES . READY ... FIRE ! ( beeping ) EVASIVE ! This is comm station Epsilon IX , calling USS Columbia . Come in , Columbia . Respond , please . ( inaudible reply ) This is Epsilon IX . Am boosting output . How read you this ? Scout Columbia NCC-621 to rendezvous with Scout Revere NCC-595 on stardate 741 1.4 . Further orders to be relayed at that time . Signed , Commodore Probert , Starfleet . End of transmission . Our sensor drone is intercepting this on Quad L-1 4 . That 's in Klingon boundaries . Who are they fighting ? Unknown , sir . I have an exterior visual . ( speaks Klingonese ) We 've plotted a course on that cloud , Commander . It will pass into Federation space fairly close to us . Heading ? Sir , it 's on a precise heading for Earth . ( speaks Vulcan ) OUR ANCESTORS CAST OUT THEIR ANIMAL PASSIONS ON THESE VERY SANDS SAVING OUR RACE THROUGH THE ATTAINMENT OF KOLINAHR . KOLINAHR : THROUGH WHICH ALL EMOTION IS RENOUNCED AND SHED . YOU HAVE LABOURED FOR MANY SEASONS , SPOCK ... AND YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WORTHY ... TO RECEIVE FROM US THIS SYMBOL OF PURE LOGIC . YOUR THOUGHTS ... GIVE THEM TO ME . OUR MINDS ARE JOINED , SPOCK ... TOGETHER , AND AS ONE . I SENSE THE CONSCIOUSNESS CALLING TO YOU FROM SPACE ... YOUR HUMAN BLOOD IS TOUCHED BY IT , SPOCK . YOU HAVE NOT YET ATTAINED KOLINAHR . HE MUST SEARCH ELSEWHERE FOR HIS ANSWER . HE SHALL NOT FIND IT HERE . LIVE LONG AND PROSPER , SPOCK . STARFLEET HEADQUARTERS STARDATE : 741 0.2 Cmdr Sonak , you were appointed as Enterprise Science Officer ? - Based on your recommendation . - Why aren 't you aboard ? Capt Decker requested I complete final briefing here before we leave . At Starfleet ? ( Kirk ) The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock . - ( Sonak ) Which requires 20 hours . - 1 2 . I 'm meeting Admiral Nogura . I won 't be more than three minutes . Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour . To you ? It is my intention to be on that ship following that meeting . Report to me in one hour . - Admiral . - Mr Scott . Those departure orders , 1 2 hours . Starfleet cannot be serious . Why aren 't the transporters operating ? A wee problem . Temporary . We have just finished 1 8 months redesigning the Enterprise . - How can she be ready in 1 2 hours ? - Take me over , please . She needs more work , a shakedown . Mr Scott , an alien object of unbelievable destructive power is less than three days away from Earth . The only starship in interception range is the Enterprise . Ready or not , she launches in 1 2 hours . The crew haven 't had near enough time with all the new equipment . And the engines are not even tested at warp power . And an untried captain . Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me stale , but I wouldn 't consider myself untried . - They gave her back to me , Scotty . - Gave her back ? I doubt it was that easy with Nogura . ( mimics accent ) You 're right . Well , any man who could manage such a feat , I would not dare disappoint . She 'll launch on time , sir , and she 'll be ready . - Thank you , Mr Scott . - Aye , sir . Cargo bay to launch crew . Travel pod is now available at dock six . - Permission to come aboard . - Granted . Welcome aboard , Admiral . Cmdr Scott , you 're needed in Engineering . Sir , you 'll excuse me . Flight deck , prepare for incoming shuttlecraft . - If you 'll follow me ... - I think I can find my way , Ensign . Aye , sir . Bridge . I thought you had that circuit patched in an hour ago . We did . We had to disconnect it . ( anxious chatter ) I 'll get somebody there as soon as I can . Captain ! Starfleet just signalled your transfer-of-command orders . - Captain . - I appreciate the welcome . I wish circumstances were less critical . Epsilon IX is monitoring the intruder . Keep a channel open . Where 's Capt Decker ? He 's in Engineering , sir . He ... doesn 't know . - Mr Chekov . - Aye , sir . Assemble the crew on the recreation deck at 0400 hours . I want to show them what we 're facing . He wanted her back . He got her . And Capt Decker ? He 's been with this ship every minute of her refitting . The possibilities of our returning from this mission in one piece may have just doubled . Check Cleary on number six . ( woman ) Space matrix restoration coils . Dilithium crystals . I knew it . The transporter sensor was not activated . Faulty modules . ( Scott ) Cleary , put a new backup sensor into the unit . Admiral Kirk . We 're getting a top-brass sendoff . She 'll launch on schedule if we have to tow her with our hands . Right ? Aye , that we will , sir . - Let 's talk . - Sure . - Tell me when the backup 's ready . - Aye , sir . Sir , I hope this isn 't some kind of pep talk . - I 'm too busy . - I 'm taking over , Will . You 're what ? I 'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise . You 'll stay on as Executive Officer . Temporary grade reduction to Commander . You personally are assuming command ? Yeah . May I ask why ? My experience . Five years out there dealing with unknowns like this . My familiarity with the Enterprise , its crew . Admiral , this is an almost totally new Enterprise . - You don 't know her like I do . - That 's why you 're staying aboard . I 'm sorry , Will . No , Admiral , I don 't think you 're sorry , not one damn bit . I remember when you recommended me for command . You said how much you hoped you 'd find a way to get a starship again . Well , sir , it looks like you found a way . Report to the bridge , Commander , immediately . Aye , sir . - ( alarm ) - Transporter room . Come in . Red line on the transporter . - Transporter , do not engage . - It 's too late . They 're beaming . Do you read me , Starfleet ? Override us . Pull them back . Unable to retrieve their pattern , Enterprise . Give it to me . Starfleet , boost your matter gain . We need more signal . More signal . - We 're losing their pattern . - Oh , no , they 're forming . ( screaming ) ( screaming ) Starfleet , do you have them ? Enterprise , what we got back didn 't live long , fortunately . Starfleet , Kirk . Please express my condolences to their families . Cmdr Sonak 's can be reached through the Vulcan Embassy . There was nothing you could have done , Rand . It wasn 't your fault . - Yeoman , turboshaft eight ? - Back that way , sir . We must replace Cmdr Sonak . I 'd still like a Vulcan if possible . None available , Captain . No one 's fully rated on this design . You are , Mr Decker . You 'll have to double as Science Officer . That 's all we know about it , ... .. except that it is now 53.4 hours away from Earth . Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way . Our orders are to intercept , investigate , and take whatever action is necessary . And possible . ( signal ) Bridge to Captain . Priority signal from Epsilon IX . - Put it on viewer . - On viewer . Enterprise , the cloud is definitely a power field ofsome kind . Measures ... my God ... over two aus in diameter . Must be something incredible inside there generating it . We 're transmitting friendship messages on all frequencies . - No response . - Null reading at the centre . There 's something inside , but all scans are reflected back . - A power surge . - Receiving an odd pattern . They could be viewing our scans as a hostile act . - They 're reacting to our scans . - Deflectors , full ! ( alarm ) - We are under attack . - External view . Viewer off . Pre-launch countdown will commence in 40 minutes . Transporter system fully repaired and functioning , sir . Dock signals clear . Reply we are awaiting final crew replacements . Aye , sir . Transporter personnel reports the Navigator Lt llia . She 's already aboard and en route to the bridge , sir . She 's Deltan , Captain . - Lt llia reporting for duty , sir . - Welcome aboard , Lieutenant . - Hello , llia . - Decker . I was stationed on the Lieutenant 's home planet some years ago . Cmdr Decker ? Our Exec and Science Officer . Capt Kirk has the utmost confidence in me . And in you too , Lieutenant . My oath of celibacy is on record . May I assume my duties ? By all means . Captain , our last six crew members are ready to beam up , but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter . Oh ? I 'll see to it that he beams up . Transporter room . Ellen , what was the problem down there ? He insisted we go first . Said something about seeing how it scrambled our molecules . That has a familiar ring . Starfleet , this is Capt Kirk . Beam that officer up now . And you swore never to return to Starfleet . Just a moment , Captain , sir . I 'll explain what happened . Your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little-known , seldom-used reserve activation clause . In simpler language , Captain , they drafted me . They didn 't . This was your idea , wasn 't it ? There 's a thing out there . Any object we don 't understand is always a " thing " . Headed this way . I need you . Damn it , Bones , I need you . Badly . - Permission to come aboard ? - ( Rand ) Permission granted , sir . Well , Jim , I hear Chapel 's an MD now . I 'm going to need a top nurse , not a doctor who 'll argue every diagnosis with me . They probably redesigned the whole sickbay , too . Engineers love to change things . Dock control reports ready , sir . - Helm ready , sir . - Orbital departure on plot , sir . Yard Command signalling clear , sir . - Manoeuvring thrusters , Mr Sulu . - Manoeuvring thrusters . Hold station . Thrusters at station-keeping , sir . Thrusters ahead , Mr Sulu . Take us out . Intermix set , bridge . Impulse power at your discretion . Impulse power , Mr Sulu . Ahead , warp point five . - Departure angle on viewer . - Departure angle . - Viewer ahead . - Viewer ahead . Captain 's log , stardate 7412.6 , 1 . 8 hours from launch . In order to intercept the intruder at the earliest possible time , we must risk engaging warp drive while still within the solar system . Captain , assuming we have full warp capability , accelerating to warp seven outside the solar system will bring us to IP with the intruder in 20.1 hours . Bones , do the new facilities meet with your approval ? They do not . It 's like working in a computer centre . - Programming ready ? - ( Decker ) Set for warp entry . But I still recommend further simulation study . Mr Decker , every minute brings that object closer to Earth . Engineering , stand by for warp drive . ( Scott ) We need further simulation on flow sensors . Engineer , we need warp speed now . Jim , you 're pushing . Your people know their jobs . - That 's it . I can 't do any better . - Aye , lad . It 's borderline on the simulator . I cannot guarantee she 'll hold up . Warp drive , Mr Scott . Ahead , warp one , Mr Sulu . Accelerating to warp one , sir . Warp point seven , ... point eight . Warp one , sir . - Mr Decker ... - ( alarm ) Wormhole . Get us back on impulse power . Full reverse . Negative helm control . Going reverse on impulse power . Subspace frequencies jammed , sir . Wormhole effect . Negative control will continue 22.5 seconds before velocity slows to sublight speed . Unidentified small object is in the wormhole with us , directly ahead . Force fields up full . Put object on viewer . Manual override on helm . - No manual response . - Navigational deflectors coming up . Distortion has overloaded power systems . Navigational deflectors inoperative . Directional control also inoperative . - ( distorted ) Time to impact ? - 20 seconds . Mr Chekov , stand by on phasers . No . Belay that phaser order . Arm photon torpedoes . Photon torpedoes ... .. armed . Object is an asteroid . Reading mass point seven . Targeting asteroid . Impact in ten seconds . ( Ilia ) lmpact in eight seconds . Fire torpedoes . - Six . - Torpedoes away . Four . Helm control restored , sir . - Position report , Navigator . - Computing new intersection course . - Communications normal . - Negative damage reported , Captain . No casualties reported , Doctor . Wrong , Mr Chekov . There are casualties . My wits . As in " frightened out of " , Captain , sir . We 're at warp point eight . Engineer , report your status there . Just a second . We 're picking up the pieces down here . Mr Scott , we need warp drive . An engine imbalance created the wormhole in the first place . We must correct it . That object is less than two days from Earth . We must intercept it . Navigator , lay in a new heading to conform with our initial IP . Mr Sulu , you have the conn . Mr Decker , I 'd like to see you in my quarters . Mind if I tag along , Captain ? Level five . Explanation . Why was my phaser order countermanded ? The Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channelling it through the main engines . When they went into antimatter imbalance , the phasers were automatically cut off . You acted properly , of course . Thank you , sir . I 'm sorry if I embarrassed you . - You saved the ship . - I 'm aware of that , sir . Stop competing with me , Decker . - Permission to speak freely ? - Granted . You haven 't logged a single star hour in two and a half years . That , plus your unfamiliarity with the ship 's redesign , in my opinion seriously jeopardises this mission . I trust you will ... nursemaid me through these difficulties , mister ? Yes , sir , I 'll do that . Then I won 't keep you from your duties any longer . - Yes , Doctor ? - Aye , sir . He may be right , Jim . Was it difficult ? No more than I expected . About as difficult as seeing you again . - I 'm sorry . - That you left Delta IV ? Or that you didn 't even say goodbye ? If I had seen you again , ... .. would you have been able to say it ? No . Make your point , Doctor . The point is , it is you who 's competing . You rammed getting this command down Starfleet 's throat . You 've used this emergency to get the Enterprise back . And I intend to keep her , is that it ? Yes . It 's an obsession . An obsession that can blind you to more critical responsibilities . Your reaction to Decker is an example , Jim . - ( signal ) - ( Uhura ) Bridge to Captain . Viewer on . Signal from a Federation-registered long-range shuttle . She wishes to come alongside and lock on . For what purpose ? Security scan shows it has a grade-one priority , Captain . Non-belligerency confirmed . I suspect it is a courier ofsome kind . Very well , Mr Chekov . See to it . Viewer off . Your opinion has been noted . Anything further ? That depends on you . Security scan . One boarder . Identity , Starfleet inactive . Permission to come aboard , sir . Granted , sir . Gran ... ted . ( Uhura gasps ) - ( Sulu ) Why ... Why , it 's Mr ... - Spock ! Spock ! Commander , if I may ? If ... ? Oh ! I monitored your communications with Starfleet , Captain . I 'm aware of your engine-design difficulties . I offer my services as Science Officer . With all due respect , Commander . Our Exec has no objections ? No . I know Mr Spock 's qualifications . Mr Chekov , log Mr Spock 's Starfleet commission reactivated . List him as Science Officer . Both ... effective immediately . Mr Spock ! Well , so help me , I 'm actually pleased to see you . - It 's how we all feel . - Captain , with your permission , I will discuss fuel equations with the Engineer . Mr Spock . Welcome aboard . Captain 's log , stardate 7413.4 . Thanks to Mr Spock 's timely arrival and assistance , we have the engines rebalanced into full warp capacity . Repair time less than three hours . We will be able to intercept intruder while still more than a day from Earth . Warp , point eight . Point nine . ( Sulu ) Warp two . Warp three . Warp four . Warp five . Warp six . Warp seven , sir . Science Officer Spock reporting as ordered . Please , sit down . You haven 't changed a bit . You 're just as warm and sociable as ever . Nor have you , as your predilection for irrelevancy demonstrates . Gentlemen . At last report , you were on Vulcan . Apparently to stay . Yes , you were undergoing the Kolineer discipline . Sit down . If you are referring to the Kolinahr , Doctor , you are correct . Well , however it 's pronounced , Mr Spock , it 's the Vulcan ritual supposed to purge all remaining emotions . The Kolinahr is also a discipline you broke ... to join us . Will you , please , ... sit down ? On Vulcan , I began sensing a consciousness more powerful than I have ever encountered . Thought patterns of exactingly perfect order . I believe they emanate from the intruder . I believe it may hold my answers . Well , isn 't it lucky for you that we 're heading your way ? Bones ! We need him . I need him . Then my presence is to our mutual advantage . Any thought patterns you might sense , ... .. whether they affect you or not , I expect immediately reported . Of course , Captain . Is there anything else ? No . Jim ? If this super intelligence is as important to him as he says , how do we know ... ? That he wouldn 't put his own interests ahead of the ship 's ? I could never believe that . How do we know about any of us ? ( Uhura ) Bridge to Capt Kirk . Revised estimate on cloud visual contact . 3 . 7 minutes . On my way . ( alarm ) Give us a reading , Commander . Standard light , Engineer . - Full mag on viewer . - Full mag , sir . Linguacode ? Friendship messages on all frequencies . All decks confirmed . Status red . Captain , we are being scanned . Do not return scan . It could be misinterpreted as hostility . Intruder scans emanating from the exact centre of the cloud . Energy of a type never before encountered . No response to messages . - Battle stations ? - Negative . No provocative action . Recommend defensive posture . Screens and shields . No , Mr Decker , that could also be misinterpreted as hostile . Cloud composition , Mr Spock ? - Twelfth-power energy field . - Twelfth ? We 've seen what they can do . We should take precautions . - Mr Decker ... - Captain . I suspect there 's an object at the heart of that cloud . I will not provoke an attack . If that isn 't clear ... As your Exec , it 's my duty to point out alternatives . Yes , it is . I stand corrected . Five minutes to cloud boundary . Navigator , lay in a conic section flight path to cloud centre . Bring us parallel to whatever we find in there . - Mr Sulu , tactical plot on viewer . - On viewer . That measures twelfth-power energy ? Thousands of starships couldn 't generate that much . Mr Spock ? Spock , tell me . I sense ... puzzlement . We have been contacted . Why have we not replied ? Contacted ? How ? ( alarm ) Force fields up full ! Deflectors , now ! Force fields and deflectors up full , Captain . Analysis , Mr Spock . Alien weapon is a form of plasma energy . Exact composition unknown . Guidance system unknown . All decks brace for impact . - Engineering , status report . - Systems overloading . ( screaming ) ( screams ) - Medic . - Medics are coming . Engineering to bridge . Cannot hold full power on force field . Deflector power is down 70 percent ! Divert auxiliary power to deflectors . Good . Christine , it 's Chekov . - Medic . - I can stop his pain . Thank you . Captain , the intruder has been attempting to communicate . ( high-pitched static ) Frequency more than one million megahertz . At such speed , their entire message lasts only a millisecond . I will program our computer to transmit linguacode at their frequency and rate of speed . Commander . Spock ! - Here it comes . - How is our force field ? Our shields cannot handle another attack ! Mr Spock ? - Spock . - ( Ilia ) 1 5 seconds . Spock , transmit now ! ( Ilia ) Ten seconds . Transmitting . It would seem our messages have been received and understood . I would say that was a logical assumption . One minute , 30 seconds to cloud boundary . Captain . We are confronted by a highly advanced mentality , yet they cannot understand who we are or what we want . Yet they understood our message . They broke off the attack . They may have attacked only as a warning to us to keep away . That would presuppose a feeling , Commander . Compassion . I sensed no emotion , ... .. only pure logic . - Mr Sulu , hold present position . - Holding position , sir . - Tactical plot on viewer . - Course projection on tactical , sir . - Opinion , Mr Spock . - Recommend we proceed . Mr Decker ? I advise caution . We can 't withstand another attack . That thing is 20 hours from Earth . We know nothing about it . Precisely the point . We don 't know what it 'll do . Moving into that cloud at this time is an unwarranted gamble . How do you define " unwarranted " ? You asked my opinion , sir . Viewer , standard ahead . Navigator , maintain course . Helmsman , steady as she goes . No vessel could generate a power field of this magnitude . Spock ? Instruments fluctuating , Captain . Patterns unrecognisable . Unable to make contact with Starfleet . Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud is being reflected back . ( Sulu ) We 're closing on it rapidly , Captain . Reduce magnification factor four , Mr Sulu . We 're already two settings below that . Mr Sulu , ... bring us into a parallel course over the alien at 500 metres . 500 metres ? Then take us out to 1 00 kilometres , adjusting parallel course . Aye , sir . - Viewer astern . - Reverse angle on the viewer . 500 metres . Viewer ahead , sir . Hold relative position here . ( alarm ) ( loud drone ) Mr Spock ! Can that be one of their crew ? A probe from their vessel , Captain . Plasma-energy combination . Don 't interfere with it ! Absolutely , I will not interfere ! No one interfere . It doesn 't seem interested in us , only the ship . Computer off . It 's taken control of the computer ! It 's running our records . Earth defences . Starfleet strength . ( screams ) Ilia ! Ilia ! This is how I define " unwarranted " ! Activate auxiliary computer circuits through manual shut-off . ( alarm ) ( Spock ) We have been seized by a tractor beam . ( Kirk ) Someone take the Navigator 's station . - Engineering , emergency power . - DiFalco to bridge . Captain , if we don 't break free in 1 5 seconds , she 'll burn up ! We cannot break free . We have only a fraction of the power necessary . Engineering , belay that order . Disengage main-drive systems . Chief DiFalco , take over Lt llia 's station . DiFalco , disengage engine navigation relays . Force-field circuits E1 0 through 1 4 show ready for reactivation . Confirm , please . Scotty , drive systems should be free now . - Commander . - Ready to launch remote drone with ship 's records , including our present situation . Delay launch . Our drone can 't escape as long as we 're held . Aye . Captain . A maximum phaser strike might weaken it enough for us to break free . Break free to where ? Any show of resistance would be futile . We don 't know that , Mr Spock . Why are you opposed to trying ? Why bring us inside ? Not to destroy us . They could have done that outside . They still can . Curiosity , Mr Decker . Insatiable curiosity . Captain , photic sonar readings indicate the aperture is closing . We 're trapped , sir . ( Sulu ) Reverse angle on the viewer . ( beeping ) Tractor beam has released us , Captain . Confirmed . Vessel is floating free . No forward momentum . - Viewer ahead . - Viewer ahead , sir . Manoeuvring thrusters , Mr Sulu . Ahead one third . ( Sulu ) Thrusters ahead one third . Let 's take a look . Full sensor scan , Mr Spock . They can 't expect us not to scan them now . We 're looking down their throat . We 've got them just where they want us . ( Sulu ) It 's closing up . Hold position . ( Spock ) Captain . All our scans are being reflected back . - Sensors are useless . - Damn ! What do you make of this ? I believe the closed orifice leads to another chamber . Undoubtedly , part of the vessel 's inner mechanism . I suspect it may be necessary ... ( alarm ) Intruder alert ! Deck five . Officers ' quarters . Have Security meet me at the elevator . Spock . Mr Decker , you have the conn . Hold position . You are the Kirk unit . You will assist me . I 've been programmed by V 'Ger to observe and record normal functions of the carbon-based units infesting USS Enterprise . - Jim , what 's going on ? - Tricorder . Who is ... .. V 'Ger ? V 'Ger is that which programmed me . Is V 'Ger the name of the captain of the alien vessel ? Jim , this is a mechanism ! ( Spock ) A probe , Captain . No doubt , a sensor-transceiver combination . Recording everything we say and do . - Where 's Lt llia ? - That unit no longer functions . I 've been given its form to talk with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise . Carbon-based units ? Humans , Ensign Perez . Us . Why does V 'Ger travel to the third planet of the solar system ahead ? To find the Creator . To find the Creator ? Whose ... ? What does V 'Ger want with the Creator ? - To join with him . - To join with the Creator ? How ? V 'Ger and the Creator will become one . And who is the Creator ? The Creator is that which created V 'Ger . - Who is V 'Ger ? - That which seeks the Creator . I 'm ready to commence my observations . An examination of this probe might provide insight into those who manufactured it - and how to deal with them . - Fine . Let 's get her to sickbay . I 'm programmed to observe and record only the normal functions of the carbon-based units . The ... examination is a normal function . You may proceed . ( McCoy ) Micro-miniature hydraulics . Sensors . And molecule-sized multiprocessor chips . - And take a look at this . - Osmotic micro-pump . Right here . Even the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated . Every exocrine system is the same , too . Even eye moisture . Dec-ker . Fascinating . Not " Decker unit " . Gentlemen . Will . - What happened to her ? - Captain . This probe may be our key to the aliens . - Probe ? llia ? - Exactly . It is a programmed mechanism . Its body duplicates our Navigator in precise detail . Suppose that beneath its programming Ilia 's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision . - They had a pattern to follow . - Indeed . They may have followed it too precisely . Ilia 's memory , her feelings of loyalty , obedience , friendship , might all be there ! ( Spock ) You did have a relationship with Lt llia . That probe in another form is what killed llia ! Commander ! Will . We 're locked in an alien vessel six hours from Earth orbit . Our only contact with our captor is that probe . If we could control it , use it . I have recorded enough here . You will now assist me further . The Decker unit can assist you with much greater efficiency . Carry on with your assignment , Mr Decker . Aye , sir . I am concerned with that being our only source of information . Captain 's log , stardate 7414 . 1 . Our best estimates place us four hours from Earth . No significant progress thus far reviving llia memory patterns within the alien probe . This remains our only means of contact with our captor . ( Decker ) All those vessels were called Enterprise . The carbon units use this area for recreation . This is one of the games . What types of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy ? The words " recreation " and " enjoy " have no meaning to my programming . Ilia enjoyed this game . She nearly always won . Good . He 's using audio-visual association . This device serves no purpose . Why does Enterprise require the presence of carbon units ? Enterprise could not function without them . More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage . What does that mean ? When my examination is complete , all carbon units will be reduced to data patterns . Within you are the memory patterns of ... a certain carbon unit . If I can help you to revive those patterns , you could understand our functions better . That is logical . You may proceed . ( Dr Chapel ) I remember Lt llia once mentioning she wore that . Put it on . On Delta . Remember ? ( Dr Chapel ) llia ? Dr Chapel . Will ? Ilia . ( McCoy ) Commander . Commander ! This is a mechanism . Ilia , help us make direct contact with V 'Ger . I cannot . This Creator V 'Ger 's looking for . What is it ? V 'Ger does not know . Computer , commence recording . Capt Kirk , these messages will detail my attempt to contact the aliens . I intend to calculate acceleration rate to coincide with the opening of the V 'Ger orifice . This should facilitate a better view of the interior . Starfleet signals are growing in strength , sir . They still have the intruder on their monitors . - It 's decelerating . - Confirmed . Lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into Earth orbit . Sir , airlock four has been opened . A thruster suit is reported missing . A thruster suit ? That 's Spock . Damn him ! Bring him back here . No , wait . - Get a fix on his position . - Aye , sir . I have penetrated the next chamber of the aliens ' interior . I 'm witnessing some sort of dimensional image which I believe is a representation of V 'Ger 's home planet . I 'm passing through a connecting tunnel . Apparently a kind of plasma-energy conduit . Possibly , a field coil for a gigantic imaging system . Curious . I 'm seeing images of planets . Moons . Stars . Whole galaxies stored , recorded . It may be a representation of V 'Ger 's entire journey . But who or what are we dealing with ? The Epsilon IX station , stored here with every detail . Captain , I am now quite convinced that all of this is V 'Ger . That we are inside a living machine . Ilia ! The sensor ... must contain some special meaning . I must try to mind-meld with it . ( yells ) Spock ! Spock ! Spock ! Now scanning pons area . Spinal nerve fibre connection . Indications of some neurological trauma . The power pouring through that mind-meld must have been staggering . - Spock . - Jim . - I should have known . - Were you right ? About V 'Ger ? A life form of its own . A conscious , living entity . ( Dr Chapel ) A living machine ? It considers the Enterprise a living machine . I saw V 'Ger 's planet . A planet populated by living machines . Unbelievable technology . V 'Ger has knowledge that spans this universe . And yet , with all its pure logic , ... .. V 'Ger is barren . Cold . No mystery . No beauty . I should have ... known ... Known ? Known what ? Spock ! What should you have known ? What should you have known ? Jim ... This simple feeling ... .. is beyond V 'Ger 's comprehension . No meaning . No hope . Jim ... No answers . It 's asking questions . " Is this ... all that I am ? " " Is there nothing more ? " ( Uhura ) Bridge to Captain . Kirk here . A faint signal from Starfleet , sir . Intruder cloud has been located on the monitors for 27 minutes . Cloud dissipating rapidly as it approaches . Starfleet reports velocity is slowed to subwarp speed . We are three minutes from Earth orbit . I 'll be right there . I need Spock on the bridge . ( Dr Chapel ) Dalaphaline , five ccs . ( Uhura ) Starfleet is sending this tactical on V 'Ger 's position . V 'Ger is transmitting a signal . Jim ! From V 'Ger . V 'Ger signals the Creator . Spock ? A simple binary code , transmitted by carrier-wave signal . Radio . Radio ? Jim , V 'Ger expects an answer . An answer ? I don 't know the question . ( Ilia ) The Creator has not responded . All planetary defence systems have just gone inoperative . Starfleet says the devices are proceeding to equidistant positions orbiting the planet ! The same things that hit us . They are hundreds of times more powerful . From those positions , they could devastate the entire planet . Why ? The Creator has not answered . The carbon-unit infestation is to be removed from the planet . - Why ? - You infest Enterprise . You interfere with the Creator in the same manner . Carbon units are not an infestation . They are ... a natural function of the Creator 's planet . - They are living things . - They are not true life forms . Only the Creator and other similar life forms are true . Similar life forms . Jim , V 'Ger is saying its Creator is a machine . Machine ! Captain . V 'Ger is a child . I suggest you treat it as such . - A child ? - Yes , Captain . A child . Evolving , learning , searching . - Instinctively needing . - Needing what ? Spock ! This child is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth ! What do you suggest we do ? Spank it ? It knows only that it needs , Commander . But , like so many of us , it does not know what . The carbon units know why the Creator has not responded . Disclose the information . Not until V 'Ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet . Captain ! I 'm losing Starfleet ! lnterference from V 'Ger . Kirk unit , disclose the information . Why has the Creator not responded ? No . ( rumbling ) Secure all stations . Clear the bridge . ( crashing ) Clear the bridge , Captain ? That was the order . Clear the bridge . Your child is having a tantrum , Mr Spock . V 'Ger requires the information . Bridge ! Secure all stations . Move out . Jim , what the hell kind of strategy is this ? Ship 's functions going to automatic . If V 'Ger destroys the Enterprise , the information will be destroyed . It is illogical to withhold required information . Kirk unit ! Kirk unit ! Why do you not disclose information ? V 'Ger will destroy the carbon units on the third planet . They repressed the Creator . The information will not be disclosed ! V 'Ger needs the information . Then V 'Ger must withdraw all the orbiting devices . V 'Ger will comply , if the carbon units will disclose the information . It learns fast , doesn 't it ? Captain , the vessel , V 'Ger , obviously operates from a central brain complex . The orbiting devices are controlled from that point . Precisely . The information cannot be disclosed to V 'Ger 's probe . But only to V 'Ger , directly . - Forward motion , Captain . - Tractor beam . Captain , what 's the next move ? The question is , Mr Decker , is there a next move ? Resume duty stations . All personnel , resume stations . Well , Mr Decker , it seems my bluff has been called . I 'm afraid our hand is weak , Captain . Mr Chekov , when do those devices reach final position ? 27 minutes . Mark . - Engineering . - Scott here . Mr Scott , be prepared to execute Starfleet order 2005 . When , sir ? - On my command . - Aye , sir . Why has the Captain ordered self-destruct , sir ? I would say , lass , because he thinks , he hopes , that when we go up , we 'll take the intruder with us . Will we ? When that much matter and antimatter are brought together , yes , indeed . 1 8 minutes to device activation , sir . Give me an all-decks read-out . Starfleet has been apprised of our situation , Captain . Crew status is 172 at duty stations . 248 off duty . 1 1 in sickbay , all minor . Over . Tractor beam remains constant . We are 1 7 kilometres inside the vessel . Engineering , show me your readings . Deck four , that temperature should read 1013 degrees . Please confirm . Spock . Mr Spock . - Not for us ? - No , Captain , not for us . For V 'Ger . I weep for V 'Ger as I would for a brother . As I was when I came aboard , so is V 'Ger now . Empty , incomplete and searching . Logic and knowledge are not enough . Spock , are you saying you found what you needed , but V 'Ger hasn 't ? What would V 'Ger need to fulfil itself ? Each of us , at some time in our lives , turns to someone . A father , a brother , a god , and asks , " Why am I here ? " " What was I meant to be ? " V 'Ger hopes to touch its Creator . To find its answers . " Is this all that I am ? ls there nothing more ? " Captain ? Forward motion slowing , Captain . Captain , I believe that is our destination . An oxygen gravity envelope is forming outside the Enterprise . Forward motion stopped , Captain . V 'Ger . Sir , I 've located the source of V 'Ger 's radio signal . It 's directly ahead . That transmitter is a vital link between V 'Ger and its Creator . The carbon units will now provide V 'Ger with the required information . Spock . Bones . Mr Decker . I will contact you every five minutes . Captain . I 'd like to go along . Mr Sulu , you have the conn . V 'Ger . V-G-E-R . V 'Ger . V-O-Y-A-G-E-R . Voyager ! Voyager Vl ? NASA . National Aeronautics and Space Administration . Jim , this was launched more than 300 years ago . Voyager series . Designed to collect data , and transmit it back to Earth . ( electronic pulses ) Captain ! Voyager VI disappeared into what they used to call a black hole . It must have emerged on the far side of the galaxy . And fell into the machine planet 's gravitational field . The machine inhabitants found it to be one of their own kind . Primitive yet kindred . They discovered its simple 20th-century programming . Collect all data possible . Learn all that is learnable . Return that information to its Creator . ( Spock ) Precisely , Mr Decker . The machines interpreted it literally . They built this entire vessel so Voyager could fulfil its programming . And on its journey back , it amassed so much knowledge , it achieved consciousness itself . It became a living thing . ( electronic pulses ) Kirk unit . V 'Ger awaits the information . Enterprise , order up the ship 's computer library of records on the late 20th-century NASA probe , Voyager Vl . We want the old NASA code signal that instructs the probe to transmit its data . - And fast , Uhura ! - Aye , sir . It 's been signalling its readiness to transmit its information . No one on Earth could recognise the old signal and respond . The Creator does not answer . V 'Ger . V 'Ger . V 'Ger . We are the Creator . That is not logical . Carbon units are not true life forms . We will prove it . We will make it possible for you to complete your programming . Only the Creator could accomplish that . - ( beeping ) - Enterprise . We have just received the response code . Set the Enterprise transmitter on appropriate frequency and transmit the code now . Transmitting . 504 . 329 . 31 7 . 51 0 . And the final sequence ... That should trigger Voyager 's transmitter . Voyager is not transmitting its data , Captain . The Creator must join with V 'Ger . Uhura , repeat the final sequence . The Creator must join with V 'Ger . Voyager is not transmitting because it did not receive the final sequence . Jim ! We 're down to ten minutes . Enterprise , stand by . - The antenna leads are melted away . - Yes , just now . By V 'Ger itself . Why ? - To prevent reception . - Of course . To bring the Creator here . To finish transmitting the code in person . To touch the Creator . Capture God ? V 'Ger 's in for one hell of a disappointment . Perhaps not , Doctor . ( bang ) Captain . V 'Ger must evolve . Its knowledge has reached the limits of this universe . What it requires is the answer to its question , " Is there nothing more ? " What more is there than the universe ? Other dimensions , levels of being . Whose existence cannot be proven logically . Therefore , V 'Ger is incapable of believing in them . What V 'Ger needs in order to evolve is a human quality . Our capacity to leap beyond logic . Joining with its Creator might accomplish that . This machine wants to physically join with a human ? Is that possible ? Let 's find out . Decker ! I 'll key the sequence through the ground-test computer . You don 't know what that 'll do ! Yes , I do , Doctor . Decker , don 't ! Jim , I want this . As much as you wanted the Enterprise , I want this . ( Sulu ) Captain . Spock ! Did we just see the beginning of a new life form ? Yes , Captain . We witnessed a birth . Possibly a next step in our evolution . I wonder ... It 's been a long time since I delivered a baby . - I hope it got off to a good start . - I hope so , too . I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose . Out of our own human weaknesses , and the drive that compels us to overcome them . And a lot of foolish human emotions , right , Mr Spock ? Quite true , Doctor . Unfortunately , it will have to deal with them as well . Starfleet request damage and injury reports and vessel status . Report two casualties . Lt llia . Capt Decker . ( Uhura ) Aye , sir . Correction . They 're not casualties . They are ... List them as missing . - Vessel status fully operational . - ( Uhura ) Aye , sir . Mr Scott ! Shall we give the Enterprise a proper shakedown ? I would say it 's time for that , sir . We can have you on Vulcan in four days , Mr Spock . Unnecessary , Mr Scott . My task on Vulcan is completed . Mr Sulu ? Ahead warp one . ( Sulu ) Warp one , sir . ( DiFalco ) Heading , sir ? Out there . Thataway .

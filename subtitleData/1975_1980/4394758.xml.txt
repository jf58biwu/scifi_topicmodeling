 MAN : Come on , come on . Come on . Here you are , then . Go on ! Hello ! - Before you ask , I 'm well . And you ? - Me , too . Oh , thank God for that . I need someone to talk to . It 's a great old horse but a rotten conversationalist . - It looks hard work . - It gets you fit . - And the horse . - She was fit already . Is it a boy or a girl ? What 's all that ? Well , there 's dandelions , beech leaves ... - What do you use them for ? - Well , to eat . - You 're kidding ? - No . They 're like cabbage , but softer . - May I ? - Well , have a dandelion leaf . Not bad . You can make a very drinkable liqueur out of them as well . And that one 's brooklime , a sort of watercress . Cure the gout with a sprig of mint , sleep with your feet facing north . - You one of those ? - A real old crank in other words ! I never said anything about old . Hello , beauty ! Work you hard , does he ? There you are , you see ? She doesn 't even answer . MINA : Mushroom omelette cooked in beech nut oil . A little watercress and wild spinach , some dandelion coffee , and a glass of beech noyau . Now what do you say to that ? Well , first I 'd say where , then I 'd say when ? ( MINA LAUGHS ) - Do you know Whitecross ? - I 've heard of it . - Well , it 's about four miles down river . - Down canal . - That 's three locks . - As you say . - Well , do you mind if I look around ? - No . Help yourself . Don 't close any hatches or windows , will you ? Why ? Can 't you get enough fresh air ? - Methyl alcohol . - Where ? Oh , in some barrels . Lets off a heavy vapour . It 's highly inflammable . And you don 't fancy blowing yourself up . No , not really . We 've got our own still , but we 're not so posh . We call it wood alcohol . Oh , really ? We call it CHCOH , as a matter of fact . What else have you got in this travelling shop ? Oh , this and that . Grain , spuds , ironmongery , Wellington boots . Where on earth did you get them from ? Well , we found this old house , see . A vicarage it was , with a whacking great rubber tree planted in the hall ! - No ? - Sorry ! Well , how about an abandoned lorry in a lay-by off what was once the A40 loaded with boxes and boxes of brand-new boots ? - Oh , yes , I 'd buy that . - That 's the truth . ( SIGHS ) The A40 . - I love that hat ! - Yes , so do I. Keep your fingers off it . By rights it should be covered in fishhooks . Are you a big fisherman ? I couldn 't pull a packet of fish fingers out of a deep freeze , let alone a canal . How about letting us have some of your wellies ? - Ah-ah . They are going to Woodkirk . - How many pairs have you got ? - Thirty or 40 . - Oh , they 'd never miss half a dozen . Would they ? - Well ... - Oh , go on . Be a devil . Would you throw in one of your dinners like you described ? - For you ? Any time . - Okay , you 're on . Who knows , you might like it so much , you decide to stay . - Who knows ? - What do your people need ? Oh , couple of male goats , sugar beet , some fruit trees , among other things . Well , we might be able to help . We have lots of dry bracken for bedding cattle on . Who hasn 't ? Meet me tomorrow , then . - Who 's me ? - Oh ! John , John Millen . The pigeon is called Powter and the horse is called Horse . I 'm Mina with an I , M-I-N-A . - How do you do , Mina ? - How do you do ? Did your husband survive ? - No . - Oh , I 'm sorry . - Were you married ? - No , no . Have you been a canal man all your life ? Oh , good Lord , no ! No , I used to work at Birmingham airport . Marshaller . You know , the bloke with the ear muffs and the ping-pong bats . Two years ago , I was as deaf as a post . Couldn 't hear a 747 , let alone a thrush . Can you let me off here ? Yes , sure . Chuck us that rope , will you ? That 's right . Now shove the helm away from you . - Right . - The tiller away from you , that 's it . That 's the way . Hello ! Oh , lummy , I haven 't stopped the horse . Horse , whoa ! Whoa ! - I must be home before it gets dark . - Well , it was nice meeting you , Mina . - See you tomorrow , John . - Yeah . Four miles , you say ? It 'll probably be after lunch . Some of those locks are in a terrible state . - Oh , that 's all right . - Well , I look forward to seeing you . Me , too . Hi ! Painful ? - And then some . - Would you like some milk ? Oh , please . - Feeling lonely ? - Very . Thank you . I bet you wish you went with the others now on the salt detail . Mmm . " For whatsoever a man soweth , so also shall he reap . " Well , one thing 's for sure . We shouldn 't go short of cabbages . No , not if we get some rain . ( CARRIAGE APPROACHING ) Whoa ! Mina , homeward plodding her weary way . Ha ! Very weary . And I warned you before , it 's dangerous hitching lifts . - I got news , important news . - Well , come on . Tell me all about it . I was four or five miles down the canal and I met a man with a barge . - A waterbus I suppose you 'd call it . - Well , what fuel was he using ? You see ? You stopped me before I 've even started . But that 's the sort of thing I need to know . - Horse power . - What ? - The sort you lead on a rein . - Mmm . Look , the point is he had 30 or 40 pairs of boots . Wellington boots . - Boots ? - Yes . - We could do with some of those . - That 's what I told him . - And what did he say ? - He 's meeting us tomorrow . - Trade ? - Yes . Clever girl . Where did he manage to get hold of all these boots ? A lorry in a lay-by . - Well , it 's true . - That 's a bit of luck . As long as they 're not all left feet for four-year-old midgets . No . Where does he come from , this boatman of yours ? Oh , good Lord . Do you know , I never asked ? - Doesn 't sound like you . - No , it 's true . - Mina , you know something ? - Mmm-hmm . That is the most suspicious thing I 've heard in weeks . You 're not frightened ? - No . - So why is your lip trembling ? I 'm only teasing . Where did you get it ? Off that new fence , the one Jack put up before they went away . Right , let 's have a look . Ouch ! - Sting ? - Yes . Good . It 's supposed to . - Wood alcohol ? - You 're not just pretty face . Relax . Let your hand go loose . Where 's my boyfriend ? - John ? - Who else ? - Reading . - Water-Babies ? No , he finished that . - Ouch ! - Voil√† . Ugh . Oh , you can be glad it wasn 't down your thumbnail . There we are , miss . A week 's rest and you 'll be able to play the violin again . I can 't play the violin . Exactly my point , Greg . The mill , the methane gas project , all these things can only happen when we 've got size . - More people , bigger division of labour . - Exactly . It 's the old industrial argument . Only the big companies could afford research . If you don 't research , you don 't get big . Well , that 's all fine and dandy just as long as staying put and becoming big don 't become ends in themselves . - Oh , is that likely ? - Well , it 's possible . Something you got to guard against . The more fixed you become , the more reactionary you 're gonna ... - Geriatric and unlimited ? - Yeah . No . There 'll be kids here soon , Greg . Another generation , the Johns , the Lizzies . Yeah , and they 'll all be moving on just as fast as they can , like Philip and Judy , unless we make it as attractive as possible . By we , you mean me , don 't you , eh ? - How are your hands ? - My blisters have got blisters . Don 't get sidetracked . You 're pulling back , Greg . Is that what you 're trying to say ? Charles , this whole thing from the holocaust onwards , it 's ... Well , it 's all been a new lease of life for you . So ? Well , one day , this settlement of yours is gonna need a new leader . - Someone younger . - You ? No , no , someone younger , a different generation entirely . I mean , someone for whom , well , this is the reality . Not like you and me , rear-mirror drivers forever looking backwards . So ? So you gotta make this place attractive to young people . 'Cause if you don 't , it 's gonna end up like one of those South Coast resorts . Just a bunch of pension books . - One splinter removed . - Thanks , Ruth . Have you told Charles about the Wellington boots ? Yeah , we 'll stick a reception committee down by the canal tomorrow morning . Now , not so strong , John . You 'll throw yourself in . It 's more of a whip action . Use your wrists more . - Did women fish , Greg ? - Only for compliments . Well , some did , but it was mainly a man 's sport . Mina says there wouldn 't have been any fish in here at all . - Not in the old days . - She 's wrong . There 'd have been what they call coarse fish , bass , perch , bream , carp , even pike . Mina showed us a picture of a pike eating a swan . Oh , did she ? That was nice of her . It was horrid . The pike got hold of the swan by its head . Yes . Lovely , lovely . It was nice of you to tell me that . Did you know that well-hedged land can support a thousand pairs of birds on every thousand acres ? - Don 't you ever stop talking ? - Should I ? - Well , fish have got ears , you know . - Haven 't got eyelids . Well , the way you go yakking on , you 'll never catch one to find out . Look ! That 's it . All right , you two . You know what to do . - Can 't we stay and watch ? - No , you can 't . Now , go on . There 's a prize for the first one home . - Only a first prize ? - Yes , only a first prize . - What is the prize ? - Go on , run . JOHN : It 's here . - What is ? - The boat . Right . I 'll be right with you . - Is Greg there ? - Yes . - Mina , the barge is here . - Already ? But he said after lunch . Well , it 's here . I 've seen it . - Aren 't you coming ? - No . I must get some watercress . Now you run along . - Welcome to Whitecross . - Well , thank you , uncle . I 'm Jeff Kane , and my number two is Les Grice . Nice to meet you . - Looks like we was expected . - You were . - Can we look after your horse for you ? - Oh , my pleasure . He don 't like me and I don 't like him . - Well , maybe it 's because it 's a she . - Maybe it is . Well , can we offer you some hospitality ? Sounds like a good idea , eh , Les ? Bring on the dancing girls . You don 't mind if the kids look around , do you ? They 've never seen anything like this before . Be my guest . Relax . The settlement 's about half a mile from here . Well , like the publican said , what 's another half ? - You 're going to Woodkirk , I hear . - Oh , what big ears you 've got , uncle . It 's not often a barge drops in on us . What do you call it ? A barge , a waterbus ? Skylark . ( SNIFFING ) - Smells good . - Any ideas ? It 's not bad , that . Gale beer . - It 's not safe to keep in a bottle . - What , you mean it might blow up ? Right . Gale beer , where have you been all my life ? You can drink it a month after brewing . Tastes even better after the first frost . Like brussel sprouts , eh ? You say gale . Now , what sort of gale is that ? Sweet gale , it 's a sort of shrub . Was used in brewing long before hops . - Oh , you 're a little font of knowledge . - Not really . This is Mina 's province . - Who 's Mina ? - You met her yesterday . Oh , did we ? Yeah . Well , I 'll tell you , it 's been a hectic couple of days . - Well , would you like to eat now ? - Yeah , now . Well , no time like the present . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Right . Well ... Help yourself to some more beer . I 'll be back in a minute . Gale beer . - Can we eat ? - Yes , it 's all ready . You know , it 's a funny thing , Charlie . I 've seen one of those men before . - Which one ? - The one with the hat . - Remember where ? - No , I can 't place him . - Who the hell is Mina ? - Mina ! You remember Mina . # The story of Mina began in the springtime # - Easy , Jeff . Don 't push your luck . - Spoken like a true screw . A bit of bother coming up on C wing , is there , Mr Grice ? All those nasty maximum security men . ( TSKING ) Oh , it 's a good number , this . Pigs , cows , hens , geese . Sheds full of equipment . Soap . - Some sort of gas , I reckon . - You 've got eyes like X-ray machines . Habit . You clock anything that 's nickable . Yeah , I like the welcome party . I had another one of those once . - Welcome home , Jeff Kane . - Where had you been ? Borstal . Right , come on , you two . Behaving like a couple of pirates . Oh ! Stick ' em up . Now , John , just take your finger off that trigger and point the gun away . - It 's not loaded . - Never mind that . Now take your finger off the trigger and point the gun away . - That 's better . - It 's not loaded . ( GUN FIRES ) It 's all right , John . It 's all right . Never mind . At least you did what you were told , it 's all right . I didn 't think anyone else had any more bullets . ( BELCHES ) Oops ! Pardon me . You done well here , uncle . Very well . I haven 't even begun . I haven 't even scratched the surface . " Acres are the best substitute for ancestry . " I don 't know who said that . I think it was you , actually , Charles . Was it ? One of my purple moments ? Well , gents , I don 't like to rush you , but when do we talk business ? - Have we any business to talk ? - I hope so . Yeah . Well , like I said , you 're well-briefed . You are going on to Woodkirk , aren 't you ? So you tell me . Mrs McGregor , Southey Farm , she 'll drive a lot harder bargain than we will . And we drive the hardest bargain of the lot . Well , obviously , I don 't want to interfere with anybody else 's ... Oh , obviously not . All white kosher gentlemen here , aren 't we ? Old school tie on the square and all that . Jeff . The voice of my conscience . Perhaps you should listen to it more often . That sounded less than friendly , uncle . - What would you say , Les ? - Skip it . Oh , easy-going old Les , famous for it . Look , why don 't we see if we can come to a deal , hmm ? Sounds all right by me . Yeah , but it 's me that it has to sound all right by . Well , I understand you want some goats , male goats . - What would we want them for ? - Breeding . No . Not that desperate yet , are we , Les ? - Well , obviously we 've been misinformed . - Obviously . Sugar beet ? Never touch the stuff . Now , gale beer , that 'd be different . Well , it 's no problem . And you wouldn 't have a box of cigars lying around anywhere , would you ? No , I 'm sorry . Look , have you got a shortlist of the stuff that you need ? Oh , surely . Any spare blankets ? Well , we 'll have a look for you . - Binoculars ? - No . - What have we got that you want ? - Well , obviously it 's not the alcohol , we 've solved that problem for ourselves , but ... Well , the Wellington boots , we could do with about 10 pairs of those . Oh , I think we could manage that , don 't you ? - Depends . - Well , if not 10 pairs , then eight , six . KANE : Yeah , maybe . Here , can you put us up for the night ? Yes , yes , of course . - In the tree house ? - Yeah , why not ? Yeah , then we can , you know , take a walk round , see who takes our ... What takes our fancy . - Well , I think we ought to push off . - Relax . - They 'll be expecting ... - Oh , a real worry-guts . - I 'll be down by the canal later on . - Yeah , well , help yourself . Ten pair . Thanks . Just a point of interest . How is it you 've still got shotgun ammunition ? Point of interest . How did you know ? A little boy fired a shot . Well , that should have taught him something . ( HUMMING ) - They 'll expect to hear from him . - What ? A quick 30 seconds after 6 : 00 ? You know what I mean . A bloke sails off with a boatload of goods , couple of days , they 're bound to start worrying about him . Wouldn 't take you two days , would it ? What you 've got to think about is the months of hard labour , - the graft , sweat , capital . - Well , we were lucky , weren 't we ? John ! Oh . Oh , sorry . I thought you were John Millen . Where is he ? - John ? - Oh , you didn 't come with the waterbus ? Yeah , we did . Um ... Well , John , see , he had to go back . - Back ? - Yeah , to the settlement . Oh , that was sudden . - Very . - Yeah , we took over from him . - Why ? - Why what ? Well , why did he have to go back ? - Domestic . - What does that mean ? Well , his woman , see , she was took sick . GRICE : Yeah , colitis . Oh , I see . - You know him , do you ? - Yes . - He 's a good man , John , eh , Les ? - One of the best . Did he send any message ? - That depends on who you are , love . - Mina . Well , didn 't he say anything ? Yeah , he did . He said ... What was it he said , Les ? Uh , he told you , didn 't he ? Yeah . He said ... Not to worry and he 'd see you next time . - Next time ? - Yeah , that 's right . - Well , nothing else ? - Sorry . Well , like you said , it was all so sudden . What 's wrong ? Why are you wearing his hat ? You got more questions than a dog got fleas . Why ? GRICE : Oh , they done a swap . Yeah , that 's right . Exchange is no robbery . He took my poncho , I took his hat . Satisfied ? You know , this is like kitting out a foot fetishist 's parlour . - Sorry . - It 's all right . You know , I used to drink this stuff . Oh , which ? The beer or the wood alcohol ? The beer . Tweeds , a pipe , a couple of glasses of bitter , and hope they wouldn 't notice the dog collar . - Did it work ? - No , it takes time . It was like having a horn in the middle of my forehead and trying to pretend it wasn 't there . Yeah , I 'll bet it was . No , you drink that other stuff , you 'd be lucky to survive . - As strong as that ? - Mmm . Blinds you then kills you . - I 'll stick to milk . - Much safer . I 'll try , but I don 't think I 'm gonna like little Mina . - So , it was John , eh ? - Yeah . Some say good old John . And some say nothing at all . What 's that mean ? - It means I think we should go . - Go ! ( LAUGHING ) Pongs , don 't it ? Yeah , as it rots it gives off a kind of gas . Hey , could you use it as a sort of fuel ? Don 't see why not . Power from that pump , soap , gas and ... - This . - Oh , where 'd you get that ? Still waters , huh ? - Come in . - You all right ? - Hmm . - Thank you for the watercress . - Welcome . - What 's wrong ? Nothing . - That waterbus . - What about it ? When I met it yesterday , there was one man with it , John . And now there are two . Two different men . - Is that all ? - Yes . Well , there could be scores of explanations . Why don 't you ask them ? - I did . - What did they say ? That John 's wife , his woman , was taken ill . - And they replaced him ? - Yes . - Sounds credible enough . - No , he doesn 't have a wife . - He told me . - Maybe he didn 't want you to know . - Why ? - I don 't know . Have you fallen for him ? ( SCOFFS ) Fall ! You make it sound like True Confessions . I ... I liked him . - Don 't read too much into it , love . - Hmm , perhaps not . One of them was wearing his hat . Last Tuesday and Wednesday I wore your oilskin . No , that was different . That was because of the storm . Doesn 't alter the fact . ( MEN TALKING ) CHARLES : You see that valley there , there 's the canal . Whoa ! Did those men object to your going aboard the boat on your own ? - Well , if they did , they didn 't say so . - Did you look around ? Well , there 's not that much to look round . Well , could there be someone else on board ? Well , to be honest , I didn 't look that closely , but I wouldn 't have said so , no . Like I told you , I met just the one man . And neither of those two is him ? Well , whoever they are , they 've got a miniature arsenal on board . Come on . - Wide open . - Hmm . Begging to be done like those desirable bijou residences with everyone sitting , goggling , with the bedroom window on the latch , or the back door open for Tiddles . Hey , was that how you started ? Creeping ? It was never this easy . - Do you ever get a regular job ? - No , what for ? I never had no time for the nine-to-five brigade . You see them all streaming home in their HP jam jars , with a nodding dog in the back window and the paper snot rags in the front . Peasants . And now they 're all here , pretending it 's some jolly Outward Bound camp . The Duke of Edinburgh will be popping in with a few of his awards . At least villains had something to rabbit on about . Life had a bit of taste to it , a bit of colour , tempo and excitement . Was your old man bent ? So straight you could rule lines by him , poor sucker . All he ever really got out of it was poverty . Oh , everyone was stealing themselves blind , not him . There were two straight guys on the patch , my dad and the vicar . First job I ever done was the church silver . I 've just been talking to Ruth about Mina . - And our visitors . - You know ? - Yeah , she told me . - Well , what do you think ? Wouldn 't put it past Mina to get hold of the wrong end of the stick , you know . Well , I can 't say I 'm exactly bowled over by them . Me neither . Uncle ! Pet swears she 's seen one of them before . - Whereabouts ? - Can 't remember . Point is , we want those boots , and secondly , is it any of our business ? Yeah , and thirdly , is there any truth in it ? Well , let them find something they want , agree to terms and get shot of them . I just hope it 's all as simple as that . - Negotiate from strength . - What strength ? We 've already got the boots . ( SIGHING ) It 's enough to put you off mutton for the rest of your life . And washing . - Ah , another pair of hands . - Those two men . - Kane and Grice ? - Kane ! That 's his name . - What about him ? - I told you his face was familiar . - Have you met him before ? - Not met him , no . Come across him is a better way of putting it . Oh , come on . Don 't keep us in suspense . My father was on jury service , it would be about three years ago now , I suppose . Turned out to be a big trial , Crown Court and all that . It was armed robbery for platinum and scrap gold . - So ? - A security guard was killed . - Kane was one of the accused . - Are you sure ? We followed the trial every day at home in the newspaper . All the photos were in the papers . Kane got a life sentence . - What are we to do ? - Get shot of them . - Where 's Ruth gone , then ? - PET : To see the baby . - Has she got a kid ? - GREG : The baby 's mine . - Oh , good for you , uncle . - Its mother is away at the moment . Oh , that 's nice . Some of us go away to get salt from time to time . There 's a place about 120 miles north of here . We get through a lot of it . Put it on birds ' tails , do you ? - Careful , I might shrink . - I found him . - Who ? - John Millen . - Oh , did you ? How is the old boy ? - He 's dead . Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that . That was sticking in his back ! Ugly ! I noticed that the sheath on your belt is empty . I never saw that knife before in my life . Perhaps you 'd like to see if it fits . - I lost my knife months ago , right , Les ? - Right . See if it fits . - Most of these knives are the same size . - Try it . - Not at the moment , thank you , Duchess . - You killed him . You want to be more careful , going around accusing people , - it 's not nice . - And after that you stole the waterbus . Thank you all for your hospitality . Good night . CHARLES : Greg ! PET : Mina ! If you can 't look after her ... Well , I will . - He 's a murderer ! - Just take it easy , Mina . Let 's talk it over . Talk ? ( SOBBING ) What is there to talk about ? Here , pull that ladder up . I don 't fancy waking with me throat cut . - There 's no pulling that off , is there ? - Only one way . - Look , why don 't we just go ? - Now ? It 's starting to rain . When it stops . - Look , I 'm no good without my shuteye . - Oh , come on . No , I need a good solid eight hours . Here , warm your gut . No one tells me when to go , when to come , when to slop out , nobody . Now , that 's finished . - Why can 't we just get shot of them ? - Offload them onto someone else ? Can 't do that . We owe it to the other settlements . But what happens to the people here , the children , if anything happens to you and Greg ? What happens if we 're a soft touch for every thug with a hatchet or a shotgun ? I don 't know . But I do know that violence breeds violence , it never solved anything . Well , you just give us an alternative . I don 't care how you do it , but get them out of there . - It 's Paul 's house . - Those two men have guns . - CHARLES : So have we . - But no ammunition . They don 't know that . What 's wrong with going down to the canal tonight and taking all of theirs ? ( RATTLING ) - What 's up ? - Shh , I heard something . - Rain . - Sounded more like horse and cart . - Where are you going ? - To get some insurance . - What do you mean , insurance ? - Shut up and come on . LEWIS : Wait ! - CHARLES : What 's wrong ? - Let me do this . - Do what ? - This is something that I should do . Let 's try the peaceful approach . Let me be the mediator . What is there to lose ? I 'm no great shakes with the hoe , I 'm not an engineer and I can 't take an appendix out . Maybe they 'll trust me . All right . Well , anything 's better than a gunfight . - Sometimes . - What can I tell them ? Tell them they can go on their way , but without the waterbus . You can tell them that there 'll be no lynch mobs or anything like it . - I never thought there would be . - Yeah , but they might . Good point . You can also tell them they can make a start by throwing out their guns . - ' Cause we 've got all their ammunition . - Right . Shouldn 't you have a white flag or something ? Won 't this do ? - Good luck . - Thank you . KANE : That 's close enough . Well , my old friend the chaplain , known to one and all as Holy Joe . What is it , then ? Bit of communal hymn singing ? - I want you to throw down your guns . - Oh , the man of peace . " Who 's for Jesus ? " That 's what we used to say . When you 've done that , you can go in peace . Cut it out , will you ? - I can help you . - Help ? All my life people have been helping me . Schoolteachers , social workers , magistrates , psycho-analogists , probation officers , prison officers , every sort of officer . You 're a pain ! The whole lot of you , a pain ! Please , no harm will come to you . I give you my word . No , I 'll tell you what you 'll give me . Two saddled horses at the foot of this ladder , 10 minutes . - No , I 'm sorry . - If not , the girl dies . - Ten minutes . The boy , too . - What girl ? What boy ? - Lizzie and John . - You 're bluffing . That leaves you nine minutes . Do you want more proof ? Only a few seconds to spare , uncle . Now go back . Now , any tricks , you got two dead kids on your hands . Just do as they say , kids . GRICE : Come on , come on . Come on now . Come on . Carry on . Go on , get moving . Come on , that 's a boy . What are they up to ? Grice is either bone tired or drunk . - What about the kids ? - There 's no sign of them . Cover him up . We 'll move him later . What 's that ? Wood alcohol . I only hope they drank it . - Les ! Les ! - What ? - Are you all right ? - What do you mean ? How do you feel ? What do you think I mean ? - Now you ask , I feel lousy . - Just describe it . Oh , I don 't know . Like when I had sunstroke once . Pull us into the side . - Huh ? - Pull us in ! Whoa , whoa . Les , look , I can 't focus . It 's like a fog . I can 't see you . - You 've banged your nut ? - I can 't see , I 'm going blind . Take it easy . ( SLURRING ) Get some water on the back of your head . All the nerve centres are at the back of the head . Any better ? Oh , oh , my God ! - Les , don 't leave me ! - Damn kids . No , never mind . Get me inside . I 'll feel better if I lie down . - Come on . - And get me some light ! - What happened ? - One man 's sick . - He says he 's going blind . - Blind ? - Have they been drinking ? - Yes . - Out of a bottle ? - Yes . Wood alcohol . What happened ? How ? What caused it ? Good old wood alcohol . MINA : White berries . See ? And this unusual stem , with its roots under the bark of another tree , so it seems sort of hanging . Now , does anybody know what it is ? Yes , John . - It 's mistletoe . - Good boy . The mistletoe seeds are carried by a bird 's beak . When it cleans the beak , the seeds get lodged inside the bark , usually an apple or a poplar tree . The mistletoe is what we call a parasite . What 's a parasite ? A parasite is something or somebody that lives off or preys on - somebody or something else . - JOHN : Is it poisonous ? - I beg your pardon ? - I said , was it poisonous ? Yes . It 's poisonous . Oh , well . Shall we stop now ? And later we can have a quiz on all the other poisonous berries and fruits . All right ? I love that hat . JOHN : Should really be covered in fishhooks .

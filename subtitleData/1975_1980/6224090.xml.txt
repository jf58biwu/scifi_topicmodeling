 Hit it , hit it ! Way to go . I 'm trying here . Way to go , Jay Parks ! Okay , let 's go . Forward eye . 6-22 . X-3 . Okay ? Right . On one , on one . Ready ? Six . Six . Two . Six . Three . Four . My name is Morgan . I play football . We worked our butts off trying to get it together for the big Sunday game . So the coach told us to knock it off , and relax for a few days . One of my teammates , Davis , came up with the idea that we head out to the island . He went ahead to make the arrangements . I talked our PR man , Brian , into coming along . I felt the day off would do him some good , too . It 'll be great to be in the country again , and enjoy some of the open spaces that man hasn 't screwed up with his technology . My father used to say , " Morgan , " one of these days the earth will get even " with man for messing her up with his garbage . " Just let man continue to pollute the earth " the way he is , and nature will rebel . " And it 's going to be one hell of a rebellion . " Of course , I never took him seriously , but I still remember the way he looked at me when he said , " You 'll never know when and where it 's going to happen . " And once it starts , you 'll never know how and when it 'll stop . " It 's funny how my father 's prediction comes to mind when I go to the country , like today . Venison tonight , right ? .We haven 't got him yet We will . They 've got it ! Go on , beat it . Hey , what 'd you do that for ? Come on , Davis . We won . The poor bastard lost . What more do you want ? Get out of here . Hey , come on , let him go . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Jesus . Oh , my God . You stay with him , Brian , I 'll be right back , okay ? Hello . Hello ? Hello . Hello ? Where the hell did you get those goddamn chickens ? Hey , do you know those bastards almost killed me , huh ? You had no business in there . Look , my name is Morgan . I need a telephone . There 's been a bad accident in the woods out there . My friend is dead . We don 't have no phone . Well , where can I find one ? None nearby , you can 't . We 're the only farm on this end of the island . What ? No one else ? That horse , did you get it from the stable near the ferry landing ? Yes , I did . Well , when you take it back , they got a phone . Thanks a lot . By the time I get there I won 't need one . Please , mister ... Could you take a look at something that scared the wits out of me ? Hey , look , lady , I 've already seen your chickens . No . No , this is something else . I wouldn 't ask if Mr. Skinner was here . The Lord knows I wouldn 't . But I 'm frightened they 've got to it . What do you mean , " they " ? Please , mister , will you take a quick look , and tell me if you think , it 's what I think it is ? Please . Look . Do those look like ratholes to you ? Yeah , they sure do . I knew it . They got at the food . They must 've . Is this what you 've been feeding those chickens ? No . This is the way it comes to us from the Lord . The chickens won 't touch none of it , unless we mix it with the meal and the bran . Yeah , well , that wasp seems to like it well enough . I mean , what is it ? The good Lord give it to us 'cause we 're deserving people . And we pray regularly , we do . And the Lord is going to see to it that we don 't need money no more . Never . Look , lady , I don 't think you realize how dangerous this stuff could really be . Mr. Skinner 's in the city this minute , making a big , important money deal for this food . That 's what he 's doing , right now , at the same time we 're standing here talking . Yeah , but that 's not gonna help very much if something besides those chickens have gotten into this food . Well , nothing on our farm killed your friend , if that 's what you 're thinking . Lady , how large do you think those rats will grow if they 've gotten into this food of yours , huh ? Mr. Skinner 'll know what to do , no matter what ate it up . He 'll know exactly what to do . Yeah , well , I hope so , because I 'll be coming back . I didn 't think we 'd be going back like this . Yeah . What do we do now ? I guess we let the coroner figure it out . We gotta tell him what we think , don 't we ? No , I don 't think so . I mean , we 'd sound like a couple of prize idiots telling the District Attorney a giant something or other killed our buddy , wouldn 't we ? How many times you been busted up playing pro ball ? I don 't know . I don 't think there 's a guy in the league who hasn 't been laid out once or twice . Except Davis . Been playing with the team for seven years . Never even been carried off the field . Yeah , so what 's the point ? So , what I want to know is , how does a guy with all that luck have this happen to him ? Well , I guess his luck ran out . Oh , excuse me , sir . Yes ? Anything happen today , sir ? Happen ? Like , unusual . Well , a man was killed stag hunting on one of the islands . Fell off his horse . You mean , unusual like that ? Not exactly . I saw the body . His two friends brought him across . He was all swollen and ugly . You know what I mean ? I don 't suppose his friends said anything about seeing some big things , did they ? Anything of that sort , sir ? God ! Oh , God ! Who 's there ? Lord , save me , save me . I just came from the coroner 's office . Yeah , what 'd he say ? From the amount of poison in his body , he estimates that Davis was stung by no less than 250 wasps . Jesus . Come on , let 's go . Where to ? The farm . Come on , what do you want to go out there for ? The ride . Well , I 'd like to go along with you , but I 'm splitting for Chicago tonight , remember ? Come on , Brian , will you ? Hey , baby , if I don 't set up that promotion in Chicago , you jocks ain 't gonna have too many fans watching you play football . Come on , you know darn well you don 't have to be there for at least two days . Well , all right . If the truth were known , I 'm really not all that ecstatic about going out there with you , Morgan , you know . Oh , Tom , come on . Please hurry . Tom , get it going . Oh ! Oh , please stop . Please . Please , please stop ! Why didn 't you stop ? What for ? The girl was pregnant . So ? So she wanted something , Jack . Maybe they were in trouble . It can wait . We 'll pick them up on the way back You don 't care about anybody but yourself , do you ? Is that what you think of me ? I think you 're the most selfish man I know . So why do you work for me ? Because jobs for female bacteriologists are just not that easy to find , Jack . So who told you to be one ? You 're a bastard , did you know that ? As a matter of fact , I do . Oh , Tom , I don 't know what we 're gonna do . .Just stay calm Don 't worry about a thing , sweetheart . Who put this goddamn gate here ? Hey , what 's that ? Oh , my God ! What do you suppose killed them ? Well , whatever it was , it did a good job on the barn doors . I 'm really impressed , Jack . How about you ? Well , I don 't know . You can 't tell much when they 're dead . How do we know some clown didn 't make this thing out of plaster of Paris and a handful of ostrich feathers ? Let 's see if we can find Ma and Pa Kettle . I don 't see anybody . Mr. Skinner ! Hello ! Anybody around ? He said he 'd be here . Well , maybe he 's out back , huh ? Yeah . Oh , I 'm sorry , miss . I thought you was ... Well , I don 't know what ... My heads all mixed up . It was them coming in . Mr. Skinner said they would . What happened to your arm ? It was the big worms , miss , crawling horrible things . And then the rats came . Rats ? In the barn , awful giant rats . Well , we 're looking for Mr. Skinner . What do you want him for ? Well , we were supposed to meet him out here today . Mr. Skinner didn 't come home last night . Maybe he stayed over in the city . Well , that doesn 't matter . You can show us whatever you have out here . But Mr. Skinner never stays away overnight . Never . Are you trying to tell me I 've wasted my time coming out here ? Did you make a money deal with him ? No , not exactly . Then , I 'm afraid I can 't show you our secret . It wouldn 't be right . Look , I didn 't travel all the way out here to this goddamn hole to see some dead chicken carcasses . Now , do you have something you want to sell or haven 't you ? Hold it , Jack . Why don 't you just try being a little human for a change ? Mrs. Skinner , we have to get back to the city . Couldn 't you show us what your husband fed the chickens ? I won 't let Mr. Bensington take advantage of you , I promise . All right , miss , I 'll show you . I don 't care what happens . I just want my husband to be with me again . See ? That 's what your husband brought us out here for ? Just like Mr. Skinner found it . Just like that one day . At first he thought it was oil , and it was gonna make us rich . Come on , Lorna . But wait a minute , Jack , wait a minute . Look at this . I 've never seen anything like it . Mrs. Skinner , how did your husband happen to feed it to the chickens ? Well , when we found out it weren 't no oil , There was nothing to do about it , so we fed it to the chicks . Right out of the ground like that ? No , miss . Nothing 'll eat it unless we mix it with chicken feed . And did all the chickens grow ? Only the baby chicks . Nothing seemed to effect the grown ones . Nothing at all . Nothing happens to the full-grown chickens , is that right ? Well , they didn 't grow none , if that 's what you mean . But I didn 't say nothing happened to them . Well , what did happen ? They got ate by the real big ones . Come on , Lorna . Mrs. Skinner ... I don 't like you . Well , if that stuff is worth anything , I 'd like an option until Miss Scott , here gets the stuff analyzed . I don 't want nothing more to do with you . You didn 't take me seriously back there , did you ? I was only having a little joke . Jack , look ! Oh , thank you . Did you see them ? It was last night . They were right there in the middle of the road . Right in front of us . We almost hit one . What were they ? They couldn 't have been what they looked like . Yes , they were . They were these huge rats . I 've never seen anything so ugly in my life . All right , we 'll pull you out and you follow us . It won 't help . I busted my rear axle . Are you going back into the city ? Well , we have to make a stop at a farm , first , then we 'll be going right back . Okay , but if we 're still here , can we get a ride back with you then ? I think you 'd better come with us now . Oh , that 's all right , we 'll be okay . We 'll just stay inside the bus . Morgan . You okay ? Damn fortunate you happened along . Yeah . Well , actually , we didn 't just happen along . We came out here to see Mr. Skinner . What about ? Are you Mr. Skinner ? No , I 'm not Mr. Skinner . Do you know about the food the Skinners have up here ? Yeah , a little . Well , I can tell you right now , if you 're entertaining any intentions of becoming involved , you 're too late . My company controls all rights . Well , then , maybe it 's not Mr. Skinner I want to see after all , is it ? I 'm not interested in any partners . Until Mr. Skinner comes home and says he wants you to have our food , Mr. Bensington , nobody owns nothing but us . The good Lord give it to us to do as we please . Well , it would appear you were just moved back three spaces and lose a turn . Well , anyway , my company has first refusal . Miss Scott here was present when Mr. Skinner made us an offer . That was yesterday morning . Well , then , I suppose legally , you just might be right . No question about it . Good . When I throw our charges with the district attorney , I 'll know who to name . What the hell are you talking about ? Second degree murder , I guess that 's what they 'll call it . My friend was killed by your wasps yesterday afternoon . They 're not my wasps . Well , if you own the stuff that made them grow , I guess you 're liable for whatever they do . Now , wait a minute . Oh , we 'll wait more than a minute . My buddy here and I are going to give you a hand in cleaning them out . Well , you 'd better get the hell off this land . You 're trespassing . Sorry , can 't do that . We 'll have to get the wasps in their nests , and they don 't go home till after dark . Dirty bastards ! I 'm Lorna Scott . Oh , you 're with Mr. Wonderful over there ? I 'm in charge of the bacteriostasis in his plant , yes . It must be fascinating work . Since you 're dying to know what it is , I shall tell you . I keep the bacteria growth within an acceptable tolerance . How interesting . Brian , we 're gonna need something that 'll work for a wick . Maybe some rope rubbed down with powder from our shotgun shells , and some plaster or cement . See if the Skinners have any , okay ? You don 't like women around when you 're doing your thing , do you ? What 's my thing ? Facing danger . I don 't mind . Are you sure ? What 's there to mind ? Oh , can I come along ? Why not ? It won 't be easy , but I think I can learn to like you . You 're the first man I 've met who has balls enough to beat Bensington at one-upmanship . Really ? You 're nice yourself . Thomas , she kicked . Right here . Like what you see ? I realize I 'm not very attractive being so pregnant and all , but ... No , it 's not that . I just guess the whole thing wasn 't such a good idea , after all . I just thought we could see things more clearly . Thomas , I 'm seeing things very clearly , and I 'm not going to change my mind . But it 's my baby . I want it to have my name . She 'll have her own name . Did anybody ever tell you , you 're crazy ? Why ? Because I 'm happy we 're having a baby ? It 'll be the same kid even though we 're married . But our relationship won 't be , yours and mine . But what 's the difference , damn it ? We 're still the same two people . Just tell me what the difference a lousy marriage certificate has to do with our relationship ? Hey , that is exactly what I 'm talking about . Nothing ! And that 's why I don 't want one . Thomas , look at me . You love me , don 't you ? And I love you . We live together . We grow together . Do you believe that ? It 's huge . Come on , let 's get back to the farmhouse . Oh , God , forgive me for doing bad things . I swear , I won 't sin again if you just return my husband to me . A doctor ought to be taking care of this , Mrs. Skinner . The Lord healeth the sick , Lorna . That 's from the Bible . Yeah , well , I think maybe you should drive back with us tonight Oh , no , I can 't do that . When Mr. Skinner returns , he 'll want me to be here . He will . Mr. Morgan . Mr. Morgan . Mr. Morgan . They got Lorna God have mercy on the poor girl . Well , what happened ? I 'll show you . I 'll get my gun . Yeah . That slope in back of the house . That 's where we saw them . Then , all at once , they came at us ! And Lorna ran up on the slope , but the earth gave way . She fell in there . That 's where the big rats went . But Lorna 's down in there . Lorna ! Lorna , can you hear me ? Morgan ! Morgan , get me out of here ! Okay , I 'm coming down . You 're sure they were rats ? - I know a rat when I see one , mister . - Give me a hand . They 're nearly as big as horses . Is there anything you didn 't feed the food to , Mrs. Skinner ? Brian , get the rope and flashlight from the jeep , okay ? Right . Oh , Lord . It 's happened , just as Mr. Skinner said it would . Being punished ' cause we sinned against nature . The only sin , Mrs. Skinner , is your goddamn stupidity . You 're not a good man , Mr. Bensington . The things you say and do . You okay ? Yeah . Hand me the shotgun . Coming in . Got it ? Yeah . Take her up . Morgan ! Morgan ! Are you okay ? Yes . Morgan ! Morgan ! Morgan ! Careful there . Where are those ratholes ? There . There . Bensington , will you go in with me ? Don 't be a fool . Thanks , Brian . You okay ? Here . Thanks to you , kid , we missed the last ferry . You bastard . Thomas . Honey . Yes ? Please , could you just lift me up , please . Yeah , sure . You all right ? Oh , yeah . It stopped . It stopped What the hell was that ? Thomas . Rita . Rita , come to the door . Come on out . Tom , what is it ? Oh , my God ! Tom ! Oh , Tom ! Look at them . Tom . Come on , let 's get out of here . Come on . Come on . Oh , Tom , I can 't .. They 're out there , all over the place . - They 're everywhere . They 're everywhere . - Big rats . Where ? Out there on the road where your camper was ? By the camper , yeah . Wait , how many were there ? I don 't know . They 're all over the road . Come on , Lorna , we 'll drive right through them . Hold it right there . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? This car might be the only way out of here for all of us . That 's why I 'm taking it . If anybody wants to come along , they can come . Now give me the keys . Not until I know it 's safe . Safe , hell ! It 's my car , god damn it ! Give me the keys . Okay , Bensington , I 'll give you your keys back , but if you try and take any of these people out of here before I tell you it 's okay , you 're gonna have more than rats to fight . You got that ? Hold it a second , Morgan . How could they get at us inside the car ? Well , after they force us off the road , they 'll give us a choice , of either dying inside the car or coming outside and being eaten . Well , I don 't hear you coming up with a better suggestion . Well , how about this one ? You and I go for a ride in my jeep and take a little look for ourselves , huh ? What the hell for ? I don 't know . Maybe those kids exaggerated a little . - I 'm not interested . - Maybe they exaggerated a lot . I 'm still not interested . Well , just you and me , Brian , let 's go . Maybe he 's right , Morgan . His car is closed . We could plow right through the bastards . Okay , Brian , you go out there and plow right through the rats with the man . If you don 't make it , no one can say you didn 't try . All right , just tell me one thing , okay ? What the hell are we going out there for ? In this open jeep , we don 't stand a chance . Dumb bastards . They 're even worse than I thought . Jack ? Jack , the girl is sick . I don 't know what to do . It 's stopped . She could be having a miscarriage . Help me ! This is the end of it . I want it all ! Didn 't you hear what I said ? I said the girl is sick . She could be dying . Find every container you can . Pails , bottles , jugs , anything that 'll hold it . We 'll load the car and then get out of here . You don 't give a damn about the girl , do you ? You don 't give a damn about anybody , but yourself and money . Do you know what this food is worth ? Enough millions , you can use $ 100 bills for toilet paper . You can flush it down the toilet without even counting it . Well , I didn 't know that 's what you wanted money for , Jack . I 'll give you one thing , though , you 're creative . You 're a no good son of a bitch , but you 're creative . What are you stopping for ? What are you doing ? You don 't think that 's going to keep them out , do you ? I 'm going to follow that road , right down there . That road ? That 's the way the rats are coming . The rats are coming ... Oh , relax , will you , Brian ? Relax . Well , we 're in luck . The fence runs right into the water . Oh , Jesus Christ , Morgan ! You saw how big they are . This goddamn fence isn 't going to stop them , nothing 's going to stop them . Well , maybe not . Even if it did , they can swim . You know that ? Rats can swim . They 'll swim right around the end of it . No , I don 't think so . I think if they go in the water , they 'll sink straight to the bottom . Come on , are you kidding me ? You ever seen movies of a hippopotamus in the water ? I should swim so well . Yeah , well , they 've been doing it for a hell of a long time . So have rats . Yeah , at a weight of about 10 ounces . So ? At 150 pounds , the gravity pull is gonna make it a whole new thing . I think they 're gonna have to learn how to swim all over again . You could be wrong . .And the fence goes to the water on this end , too If they attack us out here in the open , we 're dead . We 've got an unbroken wire fence running across the north side of the island , with water on both sides . It won 't even slow them down . Charged with electricity , it will . You should see how funny you look , Jack . You 're scared shitless the rats will come , but you want money badly enough to chance it . Well , fill this , god damn it ! The stuff is drying up . I 'm beginning to think maybe that stuff should stay right where it is . What the hell are you talking about ? Well , it doesn 't look so good , as a super-contribution to the world , I mean . Starving people ? And you 're going to feed them all with big chickens , right ? Yeah , and giant cows and sheep , and ducks and fish , and you name it ! Yeah , well , it sounds good , but wouldn 't bigger creatures have larger appetites ? I 'm way ahead of you , kid . I 'm going to take this stuff and have it converted to plant food . Oh , and you 're gonna feed all the big animals with big plants . Right on . And within five years , hunger will be a thing of the past . And that 's what you 're doing it for , is it , Jack ? For the benefit of all the hungry people throughout the world . Especially the children . Oh , God , you 're going to make me cry . Hey , Lorna , you surprise me . I always thought you were like me . Anything for a buck . Oh , no , you underestimate yourself , baby . Nobody could be a whore like you . You 're number one . I heard that argument you had with Bensington . Are you that much concerned ? No ? Well , why 'd you throw away your job ? I couldn 't take the chance the rats would get me before I told Bensington exactly what I thought of him . You okay ? I think I 'm going to be sick again . Get up . Come on . It 's all my fault . Her pregnancy or her being out here ? Both . Well , it 's too late to do anything about either , isn 't it ? Oh , God , help us . I won 't never sin again , never . Only don 't let no rats eat us . Please , God . - Is that enough ? - Yeah . Okay . Good . Come on , baby . Choke this thing , here . There you go . Take the shotgun , Brian . You know something , I 'm supposed to be in Chicago , day after tomorrow . Yeah , I know . Think I 'll make it ? I sure hope so . Oh , Jesus , here they come . Don 't shoot . What if it doesn 't stop them ? We won ! Morgan , we won ! All right , let 's get out of here . Come on . Okay . You were right ! They can 't swim ! Let 's go . If I was a fish , I 'd have thought it was too easy . What 's the matter ? Did you count how many rats there were back there at the water ? - Just now ? - Yeah . No , I didn 't count them . Yeah , well , if you had , you 'd find out that there 's only half the bastards we left back there at that generator . So what ? So , I think the rest are up to something else . Like what ? Like , we better find out damn quick . Where the hell are you going ? Come on , Morgan , let 's break this down . Come on , let 's get the hell out of here . Oh , God . Brian ! Brian ! Morgan ! Morgan ! If you care for that girl in there with your baby , you better change your mind . Once I leave here , none of you are going to get out alive . I couldn 't take Rita back out there with those rats . There 's no way . You just didn 't see them like we did . Now , you listen to me , you get that pregnant girl of yours out of here and into that car . And don 't give me any bullshit . And the old lady goes , too . Well , get them , god damn it ! Yeah , that 's right , Jack . You be sure and take Mrs. Skinner with you . You 'll need her signature for the rights , won 't you ? What happened to your friend ? He run out on you ? Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey , come on . Hey , let go of me , you son of a bitch Hey , hey ! No , stop it ! Please , stop it ! Stop , no ! No ! Oh , Lord ! Look ! Look , look ! Get the shotgun ! Mr. Thomas . Thomas ! Listen , everything 's going to be okay . Better go in the bedroom with Rita . She 's not feeling too well . Looks like the white one 's the leader . Save your energy , Thomas . They 're out of shotgun range . Hey , we scared them off . Yeah , for a while anyway . For a while ? We can hold them off forever , man . Just cool it , will you ? Mr. Morgan ! Mr. Morgan , the well 's run dry . I been pumping and pumping since the Lord knows when . Yeah , well , you can stop pumping . Those rats have cut through the pipe right to the well . What do we do about water ? That 's the least of our problems . Those rats will be in here long before we ever get too thirsty . Oh , my God . Hey , Morgan , how do we know we can 't reach them with our shotguns out there ? Boy , just another 20 feet closer , we 'd get them all . Hey , you 're ruining those shells ! Yeah , I know . But that 's all we got left to save us . Hey , look , Thomas , count the shells we 've got . If we 're lucky enough to knock out one rat with each shell , there 'd still be enough of those bastards left to hold a hell of a people barbecue . Oh , you 've got an answer for everything , don 't you ? Well , maybe we shouldn 't have listened to you , maybe Bensington was right . Yeah , you got a point there . Well , nothing gets to you , god damn it ! We could 've been the hell away from here if it wasn 't for you . I 'll tell you what . Bensington 's car is still out there . You can take it if you want to . I 'm sure he won 't mind . I know all about delivering babies . Living on a farm , you get to know those things . Everything 's going to be all right . - Lorna . - Yeah . Can you handle one of these . Sure . You ever shot one ? No . Oh , terrific . Well , it 's ready to go . Hold it tight against your shoulder . It kicks , okay ? Yeah . God , I know my husband isn 't coming back to me . I know it , I know it . Was the finest man in the whole world . Is it possible that Bensington was right ? We could have driven through them ? Yeah , it 's possible . How can you be so cool ? Aren 't you afraid ? Sure , but I 'm more bothered that those rats are out there trying to outsmart me . If I told you how I felt right now , you 'd think I was crazy . Tell me . I want you to make love to me . It is crazy , isn 't it ? At a time like this . Listen , the first thing we 'll do when we get back to the mainland is continue this conversation , okay ? But that 's just it , I don 't think we 'll ever get back . They 're attacking again . I need more shells . How 's it going ? I 've been lying here , thinking about what it 's going to be like when those rats get inside . Morgan says we 're gonna be fine . Do you believe that ? You know , I used to think about dying a lot . I 'd sort of lie there in bed , at night , in the dark . I guess I 've always had a terrible fear of it . Rita , don 't . I used to fantasize the most horrible death . You know , the most frightening . None of them come close to being eaten by rats . The funny thing is , now that it 's happening , it really doesn 't seem to matter , except for my baby . What do you think our chances are ? Pretty good . Like hell . Have it your way . Any minute now those rats are going to bust in here , and you 're still fussing around with some lousy jars . Well , it 's something to do . Something to do ? That , my dear boy , is what life is all about . From the time you 're born , it 's finding something to do while you 're waiting to die , and you try like hell to prevent it . I 'm not afraid to die , 'cause it means I 'll be with my husband again . I 'm not afraid . Not afraid . Now , you get your ass in gear and get over there , and put that strip in that gasoline jar and move it ! I think we ought to at least talk about it . All of us . Yeah , about what ? Bensington 's car . It 's still out there , and the rats haven 't hurt it . I 'll tell you what , we 'll take a vote on it . - Good . If we ... - After we come back . From where ? Say , I 'm not going to leave Rita , if that 's what you 're thinking . Pick up those jars of gasoline , Thomas ! You 're going to kill us . Now open the front door ! Oh , God . God ! No ! Oh , no ! I think the baby means it this time . How did you know there was a dam ? Mrs. Skinner told me . Don 't let the baby die , please . Can you see ? Can you see the head ? Push . Is the head coming ? It 's showing its head . Yeah ? Yeah . Now , push . Push . Okay . Is it a boy ? What is it ? It 's a boy . It 's a boy ? It 's a boy . Jesus . We 'll never get ... We won 't by sitting here . Come on . Light this thing . Everybody upstairs , now ! Morgan ! Oh , God , no ! Well , I guess that 's the end of them . The end of Bensington 's one last big shot at immortality . We were able to get Thomas 's camper fixed long enough to get us back to the ferry and away from that nightmare for good . I 'm back with the team , and things won 't be the same without Brian and Davis . My father was right . The land rebelled much worse than he ever could have imagined . Nature was attacked , and hit back with a vengeance . I hope we got it all , and the Food of the Gods has gone back to wherever it came from . I hate to think what would happen if even a trace of that stuff is left . If it got into the watering ponds or into the irrigation ditches . Did we get it all ? Because if we didn 't ...

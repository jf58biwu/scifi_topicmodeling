 # Where be yon blackbird to ? # I know where he be # He be in yon turnip field # An ' I be after ' ee # Don 't worry , love , Hubert will find him . A day and a half from the mill , you said ? Be worth it , even at twice the distance . - Oh , sure . - Yes ! A bloke like this Campbell , a technician , is unique . For what ? Your glorification ? Well , I won 't hold you up any longer after this . Oh , I didn 't mean you . My ageing , irrepressible pacemaker ? No , of course you didn 't . We 'll get this fellow Campbell , then I 'll go off on my own mission of salvation , I promise . We 'll leave you free to chase after your Greg . But will we ? # If I find that blackbird and ... # ( BIRD SQUAWKING ) Hey up . Heard tell of a settlement nearabouts ? Got some sort of electrics boffin . Hey ? Name of Campbell . Right spot , is it ? Push off ! Now , then , mate , a civil question owns a civil answer . You had ... Look , I have not been toiling round in this neck of the woods half the morning for nowt . You give me an answer ! Just go ! Go ! ( GUN FIRES ) ( GRUNTING ) Mission ? You keep coming back to that word . A man like Charles has a big responsibility . Yes , to a good , loyal woman called Pet . He has to see things in a broader context , not just Norway . Two years of settlement and people are ready to accept a wider social organisation . - You think so ? - I 'm sure of it . But only if they have the right lead . Charles has got presence , charisma , call it what you like , he 's a natural . You think so ? What do you say , Charlie Vaughan ? Oh , don 't mind , Jenny . I spent most of my life in personnel selection . A headhunter , so-called . If you like . Personality profiles , aptitude testing , leadership assessment ... I 've never seen any halo . Ah , Jenny ' s got a point , Frank . I mean , I can hardly go riding into these settlements like it 's Palm Sunday , preaching salvation , can I ? If they 're as ready as you say , then let them show it . But you want to wait for an invitation ? At least . ( HORSE NEIGHING ) ( GRUNTING ) There . ( EXHALES ) Caught again , I fear , Mr Goss . ( WHISTLING ) - What happened ? - Assaulted , that 's what . Oh , not by her . By her electrics boffin , that 's who . - Who , by Campbell ? - That 's what she said . Mrs Letty Grant-Smithson . How do you do ? I 'm trying to get him to the church . Not much further now . I take it you 're all guerrillas . Proposing a revolution ? Potty . Must be , taking you to church . Now , there is a stable in the back of the church , but I should tie them up here , just for the moment . ( LETTY EXHALES ) Well , come on , Hubert . We 'll get you inside , shall we ? ( COW MOOING ) " And Jesus came unto the temple . " Is this your bed ? The dear man 's most welcome . All right . Uh , steady there . ( GRUNTING ) ( SIGHING ) Well , now , Hubert , it 's your back , is it ? Went down like Evel Knievel when that nag reared . Well , let 's have a look , shall we ? Aye , he 's blooming savage , that bloke . Right , oh ! Here , it 's more of them electricity people . What , mates of them who has come last year in the balloon ? That 's right . Our Queenie ain 't gonna like that . ( LAUGHING ) No , he isn 't . QUEENIE : Like what , then ? Oh , uh , they come looking for Alec . Aye ? You 're welcome to him . Is he often like that ? Violent , rushing at a horse with an axe ? - Dumb as a zombie , most often . - Zombie ! ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Only other time I knew him get uppy was with that bloke that came in the balloon . Greg Preston ? That 's right , the electricity man . Here , when are you going to get us switched on again , lover ? We got our electric blanket ready , ain 't we , Vic ? That 's right , huh ? ( LAUGHING ) Let 's go and have a look for him . He answers to the name of Sparks . Right spark he is and all , if you want someone to fix telly . ( LAUGHING ) LETTY : Alec ! Alec and I are the timber team . Did he say anything to you about why it was he went for Hubert ? Well , not a word . I came back up with the cart and your groom was laid there groaning , with our Alec just staring at him . I can only conclude he thought he was a Red . A Red ? No question which side educated people like yourselves are on . Ta very much . Crass thing is our troubles now are no worse than they have in Russia with their Lenins and Stalins and people . I might have thought our Reds would have learned something from their mistakes , but no , had to go and destroy everything . Just as my dear husband always predicted . Of course , they all tried to blame it on disease , plague and so forth , but goodness gracious , if you destroy all the services , medicines and hospitals and so forth , of course you 're going to get rats and disease . Why , they might have anticipated that , but no . Had to have their left-wing utopia . ( SCOFFS ) Nation of peasants . Still , it 's not all bad , eh ? I myself am much healthier than I was , none of those awful tranquillisers and plenty of roughage in the diet . And you good folk have got yourselves spruced up and on the go , unlike those worthless creatures down at St Lukes . Alec , dear boy , some gentlemen to see you . Hello . This is Frank Garner . I 'm Charles Vaughan . It 's Alec Campbell , isn 't it ? They 're on our side , Alec . - We 've come because ... - I know why you 've come . And the answer 's no . Now , just push off ! We just want to talk . I heard it all from those other three who came here last summer . That old fool who came off his horse , is he all right ? He 's hurt his back . It 's difficult to say how badly . Sorry about that . If he 'd had the sense to listen ... Look , just go and leave me to live my life as I choose ! There . Put the comb frames in there , clamp down the lid and then turn the handle . - So it spins out the honey ? - Yeah . You 've certainly collected plenty . Oh , that 's nothing . There 's the bulk of last summer 's yield . Gracious ! Precious stuff these days . - Eh ? - Precious stuff these days . Yeah . In summer , they is reckon that and all . Trouble with scroungers , huh ? That 's how they all come to be hived up in this stone tomb . Defences , see ? Mind , with beekeeping , it 's the knowing that counts . Can 't get this lot with a gun , can they ? Does it take long to learn ? Been a family generation . Hard it is , lass . Mmm , I can imagine . That 's how all this lot come to be here . I had me honey , and they all come buzzing in round it . Which is why they call you Queenie ? Well , that makes them a right load of drones , innit ? Uh ... Of what ? Drones . Fat , idle , useless . Like that Alec Campbell they 've all gone after . He 's the most sluggish drone in the hive . You won 't shift that scoffer , not unless you carry him out in a box . What were you doing just then ? ( STAMMERING ) Oh , just ... Summat to ease my back . After missing your lunch like that ... Oh , are you not hungry , then ? ( GRUNTS ) Here , this 'll fill your cavities . ( LAUGHING ) Well , waste not , want not , eh ? You boil your water ? Yeah , that 's right . When you got your mains turned off , it ain 't safe no more . Been having tummy upsets , have you ? No more than anyone else . Are you kidding ? Huh ! Do you know anything for worms , do you , then ? Well , we used to make a simple dose when we were at the mill , brewing up fronds of fern . Well , plenty of fern up the woods . We might see what we can do tomorrow , Vaughan , Jenny , eh ? Delighted . Still need a supply of pure water . Boiling 's only part effective . Yeah , any bright ideas ? What about that old pump out the front ? ( SCOFFING ) Hasn 't worked in years . We 'll have a go at it tomorrow . Might as well earn our keep , at least . Good luck to you . Feel better for the grub ? Just forget it , eh ? Why ? You were an engineer with the Electricity Generating Board . Your expertise , man , damn it , it 's crucial . For what ? Little thing called civilisation . ( SCOFFING ) Look , there are hydroelectric power stations in Norway , just waiting for someone like you to come along and ... and let people start living again . Living ? Pensions ? Mortgages ? Taxes ? Rush hours ? The whole crazy con trick all over again ? - You 're round the twist . - It doesn 't have to be like that ! We 're better off as we are . - In the Dark Ages ? - Aye ! Oh , come on , love , that stew should have been safe enough . I 'm not risking anything , thanks . Well , how do we tackle God 's gift to the industrial renaissance ? Bright Sparks Campbell ? Leave him in misery to stew , if you 've got any sense . He 's invaluable , love . Him ? You remember what Agnes said about hydroelectric power stations in Norway ? Even Greg couldn 't help . But he 's anti the whole idea . We 'll have to see what we can do . Well , he 's told you . Oh , there must be more to it than that . Oh , yes . CHARLES : Right , let 's have a go , then . ( LAUGHING ) Hey , Alec , come and give us a hand . ( GRUNTING ) Come on , mate . ( GRUNTING ) Hey up , it 's rusted in solid . ( GASPING ) Needs a hoist of some sort , a tackle , lifting tackle . You got any ideas ? Hey , there 's a works place not far off , engineering and that , just this side of town . We 'll have a look at that . Oh , come on , Alec , give us a hand ! Forget him . No way . Were those the only times he 's shown any real aggression ? Yesterday and when Greg Preston was here ? Yeah , as far as I know . Mind , he can get a stroppy if there 's no extra grub to stuff himself with , but ... I don 't know . Did he ever say anything about his work , his family or his past ? Only to himself . He rambled on about cost of living , inflation , nonsense like that . You want to know what he goes on about , ask her . Her name 's Letty . Fine , thank you . - Some hopes he 's got . - More than we have with you . - Foul brood , that 's your trouble . - Eh ? Here , what you blubbing about ? These , of course . What do you think ? Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about Alec ? Why , certainly . Does he have any children ? Yes , he has two children , Jean and Fiona . Both very bright girls , by all accounts . Mark you , he blames the system . He says there 's no possible hope of families growing together in the way they should while there 's this rat race tussle over jobs and promotion and so forth . Though , of course , that 's all over now . Nation of peasants . But I 'm afraid the change hasn 't helped poor Alec one bit . How do you mean ? Why , with his family . They never come to see him , never . Of course , in my case , it 's different . Roger and Jeremy , they 're under arms , you know . Far too busy to come visiting their old mum . And besides , there 's the risk . What risk ? The guerrilla fighters , Mr Garner , paving the way for when the Americans come over . The Americans ? Of course . Surely you don 't imagine any sons of mine would side with the Reds ? Oh , no . Of course not . Um , does he ever say anything about his wife ? Rita ? Never . She 's dead , you know . Died more than two years ago now . Most tragic . Some fatal disease . A most beautiful and charming woman , too . Would you care to see her photograph ? Oh , I would , very much . Come along . He sometimes leaves it in here . Little Victor used to share in here before he moved in with Bet . Shameful behaviour in a church . Oh , lamentable . Uh , where do you think he keeps it , the photograph ? Oh , I have seen it over there . What 's all this ? He used to fiddle about with it when he first came here . I 'd encourage him , too . " Try and get us The Archers , Alec . " ( CHUCKLES ) He lost heart with it after a while . Just pushed it away under here . I see . Mark you , I fancy little Victor was glad enough to move out . Oh ? Why ? Nightmares , you know . Alec has them ? Incessantly , poor soul . - The poor man 's always shouting out . - What about ? Well , his wife , of course . That 's what he calls out , you know , her name , Rita . Rita . You think you can unhook it ? Yes , uh , I 'll see if I can find a ladder . What 's the , uh , voltage for arc welding ? Come on , let 's go and find some spanners . It 's immaculate , isn 't it ? Everything clean and greased up . Drain , mothballed . Suit your mate Preston . Greg ? Besotted with technology . Jabbering on how it 's a golden heritage , how it 's our duty to preserve it . Man had made some pretty dazzling technical achievements . You reckon ? Men on the moon ? And into their graves . Science 's crowning glory . The Death plague ? You can hardly condemn the rest of it because of that . No ? No . The folly of a few scientists and politicians , hardly the fault of science itself . No difference . Well , what about you ? As an engineer yourself , you must appreciate the worth of precision tools like these . Junk . Damn it , man , your whole training ! Oh ... Oh , the men who worked here , they cared . They really cared . He cared ! He could have died in bed . But no , he had priorities . Just machines . Yes , which he valued , cherished , tried to preserve . - A useless museum . - Not to him ! His ... His skills . His life . He died trying to preserve it because , damn it , because he believed in us ! Because he believed we 'd value them , too ! Because one day , we 'd re-power and use them as he had ! Lunch , Hubert . Nice bit of rabbit . Feeling better ? Oh , delicious . Pain gone ? With the wind . Hubert ? Care for a bit of a nibble ? You 've been drinking . What , me ? You 've been at that stuff again , haven 't you ? There 's no point in suffering . Where is it ? Do you mind ? - What is it ? - Here ! Pethedine ? You stole this , didn 't you ? Like the aspirin . You took it from that chemist 's place . They had enough . It was for everybody , the fellow said . Here , give it here ! Give it back ! That 's mine ! Yours ? I thought you said it was for everyone . That bloke Greg Preston , he was an engineer , right ? Mmm . A civil engineer . Well , what do you want with a useless drone like him ? Because roads and bridges aren 't like power stations . Each has its own highly specialised technology , as Greg found out in Norway . - Oh ? - Mmm . He tried switching one back on to load . Apparently , the lubrication system was all to pot , a bearing at the base of the generator overheated , and eventually , the whole casing smashed to pieces . It 's only luck that somebody wasn 't killed . Get away . So that is why we need him . Come on , Bet . See if we can 't stir him up for you . Why not ? He might do more harm than good . A little cumulative pressure ? It ain 't asking so much , me old lover . Help ' em to get it switched back on , eh ? Better than firewood , innit , eh ? You owe it to us , you know . Grub you eat , it 'd keep us for a week . I mean , it 's not as if we want to get nasty or that but , well , if you can 't ever stir yourself for others ... ( SPITTING ) All right , I 'll go . It 's what you 've wanted all along . - We didn 't say that , Sparky . - You didn 't have to . All we 're wanting is the electrics . Aye , well , you can whistle for that . Boot me out , fine . But you 'll never get me along with them . Never ! A thick shell of resentment , all these references of his to the system . Meaning ? Oh , the promise of security for him and his family , years of working his way up the promotion ladder , the " rat race " , as he calls it . And all for what ? Nothing . The con trick . JENNY : Well , so what ? Everyone else was conned and lost that security . No , that 's not what makes him what he is . Well , perhaps the reason he keeps fuming on is something else . There must be some other reason . Such as ? Who knows ? It could be anything . ( SIGHING ) So , what now ? Well , in the good old drug-age days , a shot of pentothal . Yeah , the good old days . One substitute I could think of would be belladonna . - Deadly nightshade ? - Oh , for heaven 's sake ! Oh , just a small dose when we dish out the worm drench this evening . No . Frank , that could kill him . It could , but it would depend on his general state of health . It 's the wrong time of year for mushrooms , isn 't it ? Pity . - Mushrooms ? - Yeah . I was thinking of the fly agaric , you know , that pretty little one with the red cap , Amanita muscaria . But that 's poisonous , too . No , it isn 't . People think it is . It has an effect on the central nervous system , something like alcohol . That 's one of the things Miedel uses at Wellingham . - Your chemist ? - Yes . ( CHUCKLING ) So near and yet so far . No . You 're using him like a guinea pig . That 's a bit of a turnaround for you , isn 't it ? What ? Well , only yesterday , you wanted to write him off . Leave him in his misery to stew , you said . Yesterday , I had no idea of the extremes you 'd go to . He 's human . He 's a man , with feelings . All right , why don 't you have a go at him ? Go up in the woods , seek him out and see what you can do . What , like Brod ? Who 's Brod ? Character we met a couple of months ago . All right , I will . No , it 's far too dangerous . Look how he went for Hubert . - Oh , Jenny 's prettier than Hubert . - Thanks . I still think it 's too dodgy . It 's not half as dodgy as him and his belladonna . We can cover her . Okay , then . Please , it 'll tear . - Good-looking . - Leave it . Is it Rita ? Please ? You miss her ? Two years , Alec , it 's a long time . You were very close , weren 't you ? And Rita , do you really think she 'd want to see you like this ? Don 't you think she 'd rather see you living more as you were when you were together ? Happy ? - Alive ? - Why don 't you just go ? - Alec , just try . - Go on ! You poor , sad man . CHARLES : Jenny ? I honestly don 't think he would have done anything . Well , I 'm sorry , but from where I was standing , it looked like touch-and-go . He was looking at a picture of his wife . Did you see it ? Yes , much against his will . She had a nice smile . So , what now ? For Alec . What 's this ? Drink it down you , mate . Why can 't we just get on and eat ? Soon . It won 't purge properly if we eat immediately afterwards . Come on , Sparky , let 's get rid of them wrigglies , eh ? No worm drench , no grub , Alec . JENNY : What about Hubert ? Oh , let 's spare him further discomfort . Yes , he 's much better than he makes out . Another good night 's rest , and he 'll soon be on the move again . Sooner than that , if you dose him up with this . Here , I thought you said it was harmless . So it is , so long as you keep your running shoes on . ( LAUGHING ) ( GRUNTING ) Some ... Some ... Somebody , some water . No , it might lessen the effect . ( GRUNTS ) What is this ? Here , come and lie down . ( GROANING ) He must be allergic to the worm drench . He 's burning hot . He 'll be all right . Oh , there wasn 't any need . Take it easy , man , gently . ( GASPING ) - My eyes ... - Just relax . Take it easy . Oh , it 's so hot in here . Surely , some water . No . You 'll be all right . Hello , Rita . - You 've given him too much . - It 's make-or-break . Damn you ! Rita , is ... Is that you ? - No . - Stay with him . But he thinks that I 'm ... It 's horrible . Where are you going ? To fetch him some water , at least . No , whatever his trouble releasing , it 's going to be tough . You can 't expect me ... If he associates this with his wife , Rita , and if he 's confusing you with her , then you 're vital in this . Don 't you see that ? No . Look , you started this up there in the wood , remember ? So , for goodness ' sake , stay with him and see this thing through ! CHARLES : Frank ! Rita ? ( GASPING ) Rita . - I had ... I had to go . - Yes , Alec . You know I had to . I explained . I ... I ... I don 't remember . You must . We couldnae reach Sandy , remember ? Didnae nothing better to look after the old lady . Dumfries . She wasn 't that far north of the border . ( GASPING ) I 'd have been back down to you sooner if it hadn 't have been for that damned traffic , all those nellies piling up and panicking . Rita , don 't go . I 'm here . I 'm here . Oh , if you could just ... just have held out till I got back . So much to say , to explain . You know how it was . Always something in the damn way . Forever on call-out . Fussed with some project , or the telly . And these community classes he 's given us , eh ? Spanish ? Who wants Spanish ? Whatever have you done to him ? What 's going on ? - Tell me what 's happening . - Oh , it 's all right , Letty . ALEC : Always something ... Always chasing my wee tail like a nellie . Forever on call-out . Working half off my head and never a mind for the real things . I should have been courting you . You know that , lassie ? Instead of taking you for granted the way I did . Never a thought for your needs , your feelings . Always pitying myself . Frustrated inventor , eh ? Sparks , eh ? Always blaming you and the kids and all the time it was the damn system ! - No , Alec . - It was so ! Do you wonder I feel bad , leaving you in the end like that ? Oh , pity 's sakes , you said not to go . Leave it to Sandy , you said . But I had to see it differently . " Go north ! Go north ! " And you , poor Rita , alone at that damn hostel , not even the girls with you . He 's getting worse . FRANK : Don 't worry . Don 't worry ? Just to be there ... to hold your hand , ask forgiveness . Just ... Dear God ! And where did the love I had for you ... All these ... Those years and ... Not even there at the end . Alone ! Alone ! Are you satisfied ? He 'll be the better for it . Cathartic abreaction . It 's like lancing an abscess . Same story as mine . What ? I wasn 't there , either . Where ? With my wife , when she died . Were you ? Yes . What did you say ? I think I said I was sorry . Sorry ? What for ? Surviving , I suppose . FRANK : You see , it 's the guilt sense . I have left unsaid those things which I ought to have said . Yes , I see . So , what do we do now ? We carry on with what we 've started . We . You mean Jenny . Mmm-hmm . - That really broke her up , you know . - Mmm-hmm , I know . A very big emotional responsibility . As if she didn 't have enough . - You mean Greg ? - Yes . Frank , it 's really going to help Alec ? It 's going to cure him ? ( COUGHING ) If anything ever is . You see , for the first time in over two years , he 's confronting his sense of guilt , getting it out in the open . - I 'm so sorry . - What is it , Letty ? Alec , he 's gone . - What ? - But Jenny was with him ! Well , I ... I suggested the dear sweet girl should get some rest and leave him with me for a while . That was an hour before dawn . Alec was very restless , tossing and turning , and I thought , well , maybe a warm honey drink would help to settle him down and then , when I came back , he was ... He was ... Oh , dear . Oh , my goodness . So much for your lanced abscess ! Alec ! Careful ! CHARLES : Keep him talking ! - Let me go ! It 's my responsibility ! - You just stall him ! ALEC : Get away , Letty . Get back inside ! VIC : Hey , where are you going ? - Alec 's up there . - It 's unsafe higher up , mate . He made it . The steps is all loose ! What 's happening ? It 's that damn fool Alec ! Listen , Alec ! ALEC : Away ! Not until you 've listened to me ! Ah , let me die , man ! Let me die ! Is this part of the dream ? LETTY : Alec ! Careful . ( STONES FALLING ) - What are we going to do ? - Quiet . Always the same ! Always ! Come on , Alec , tell me ! The substation . Trouble fixing it , the circuit breaker , the air blaster kind , difficulty adjusting the contacts . And she 's calling . Rita 's calling . Finish making the adjustments . Press up to the solenoid . Switch on . Current flowing . Quarter million volts ' worth . But ... But when I look out , look out at the busbars , there 's none there ! None ! Just a chair ! The iron chair . Her legs have disappeared . Rita ! Rita ! You never harmed her ! Only a dream ! Rita ! CHARLES : Right . So , what now ? What ? Whatever fresh hell that poor man 's into , we pushed him there . We did ! Frank , you , me . - Well , he 's much calmer . - Oh , sure , for now . Charles , the state he 's in , we 're responsible . Agreed . We can 't leave him like this . - Well , where are you going ? - To be with him , of course . I was the same as you , Alec . Recurring nightmares , bottling up my guilt , going over and over and over the things that I would have said to my wife , had I been with her at the end . What happened , Alec ? You left her behind and drove north up to your mother in Dumfries , and you found that Sandy ... Who is he , your brother ? You found that he was already there . And then you got caught up in the traffic chaos when you were coming back down south . The stinking south . Best not to have come . Best to have kept her up home . To hell with their safety arm and security . You must try not to blame yourself . Failed her , all along . And the kids . Even at the end . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Uh , we want a bit of advice , Mr Vaughan . What , now ? Yeah , well , see , we made our mistakes in the past , plenty of them , I 'm not denying that , and ... Well , I 'm no leader . I never was or wanted to be . I 'm a grocer by trade and , well ... We was reckoning you could help us out , lover , that 's what . Oh . Well , how ? Well , see , we trades our honey , but ... I mean , so what ? It 's not getting us anywhere , any better off and ... Yeah , this is just a dead end , chief . But if we could feel we was , like , part of summat bigger , you know ... QUEENIE : Yeah . Yeah , maybe tie in with that settlement up Greenham way . Mmm , they 're a good lot down there . But you see , the trouble is we need someone , well ... like you , to persuade them into it . ( CHUCKLES ) Well ... Letty , we 're leaving this afternoon . Just a short trip over to Greenham , to see the people over there . Oh . Alec 's alone at the moment . Would you be good enough to go and sit with him ? Aye , certainly . And , uh , he doesn 't know yet that we 're leaving , so perhaps you 'd be good enough to tell him . But we 're not . It 's only Charles that 's going over to Greenham , and he 'll be back tomorrow . Ah , well . What are you up to ? It 's another of your tricks , isn 't it ? Can 't you leave the wretched man alone ? Give him a moment 's peace ? Jenny , I find this situation just as harrowing as you do , so please don 't make it worse by interfering . ( HUMMING ) Sounds like a hymn . " Lead us , heavenly Father , lead us . " Well , this is a church . What does it feel like to be wanted ? Well , depends on those people over at Greenham . I imagine the last thing they 'll want to do is cooperate . Well , you 'll win them over . ( CHUCKLING ) ( HUMMING ) What are you doing ? Packing . What 's wrong with Scotland ? Pitlochry , say . What ? Pitlochry , the hydroelectric scheme up there . Dozen perfectly good dams north of the border . Why bother with blessed Norway ? Bound to be any number of hydrogenerators still serviceable in Scotland . It 's time to pack , Jenny . - Pack ? - We 're leaving . But , uh , Alec ... Alec 's coming with us . What ? I 'll go and mobilise Hubert . You 're not serious ? Never more so . But Alec 's ill . What have you done ? Resorted to a little shock therapy . Take up thy bed and walk ? ( CHUCKLES ) That 's right . You see , he 's had second thoughts and come to the conclusion that the hydroelectric prospects in his beloved Scotland are far more viable than in Norway . He 's very excited about it . So hurry up and get ready . Oh ! There is one condition . - Yes ? - He wants those . - What ? - Your boots . My ... Oh , no ! Never . Here , as a ... As a keepsake , eh ? It 'll remind you of your old timber mate . Oh , they 're lovely . You 're heading north , of course ? Oh , aye , lassie . It 's where it 's all at . The heartland of the counter-revolution . - Ready for testing ? - Oh , all right there , lover . ( PANTING ) ( EXHALES ) Can 't win ' em all .

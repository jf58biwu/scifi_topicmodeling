It has the brightest anti-collision lights I think I 've ever seen . Alternating white to red . The colors are striking . this is TWA 517 . Traffic now looks like extra-bright landing lights . I thought Air East had his landing lights on . It could be a satellite . I have a primary target now in your 10 o 'clock position ... over . 31 . The traffic is proceeding northeast . No altitude readout . Center . It doesn 't appear he 'll be a problem . He 's going to descend about 1500 feet below me . Wait a second ! Stand by one . Air East 31 . The traffic has turned . He 's heading for my windshield . We 're turning immediately . descend and maintain flight level 310 . turn right 30 degrees . Get on the horn to the 45th Recon Wing .

Wait 60 seconds and the whole doggone thing repeats . - Where are the signals from ? - The neighborhood . roughly 7 seconds . Well within the plane of the ecliptic . in response to that ? No . They should be . We 've sent this combination out for weeks . But all we 're getting back are numbers . This could mean the India sounds reached a dead end . They don 't mean a thing . There 's so much we don 't know . How about where the signals originate ? Excuse me . What letter is 104 ? Excuse me . Before I got paid to speak French I used to read maps . This first number is a longitude . Two sets of three numbers . minutes and seconds . and the last two are below 60 . It 's not in the right ascension and declination on the sky . These have to be Earth coordinates . There 's a globe in the office . This is what we need . Maybe there 's a release pin underneath here . That 's a $ 2500 globe !

A plague epidemic . Nobody will believe a plague . - Anthrax . - Ranching country . There are a lot of sheep in the hills .

Tomorrow is fine . I can do other things . I 'm trying to be . I am . The Army and National Guard are supervising the evacuation . okay ? Even though there 's no such thing . It was a joke ! - -the danger will be over within 72 hours . anything you want . I 'll do . For how long ? All of you ? I wanna talk about this in person .

Wyoming was the first national monument erected in this country by Theodore Roosevelt in 1915 . Thousands of civilian refugees are fleeing the area spurred by rumors that the overturned tanker cars at Walkashi Needles Junction were filled to capacity with nerve gas . we 're going to be- - 000 vacationers . during this mishap there have been no fatalities . which soon ... depending on the prevailing winds . This is as close to the disaster as we 've been allowed to get . - -due to a strong prevailing north-south wind . Army engineers and the Wyoming National Guard are making every effort to contain the leaking toxins and evacuate an area of almost 200 square miles . Everyone is being warned : Stay out of the area . stay out of the area . - -and thousands of others are homeless . U.S. Army Materiel Command has issued these new area restrictions : All roadways north of Crowheart on Interstate 25 . Shit . All roads leading into the Grand Tetons west of Meteste . All multilane undivided full-traffic interchange ... local and historic stage roads south of Cody . Why aren 't there fat lines instead of these thin ones ?

The police dragged the river for him . I told them he wasn 't in the river . He wasn 't . Then they went around to every house within five miles looking inside back-yard refrigerators . They asked if I 'd seen any strangers in the neighborhood . I don 't believe it 's real . I don 't believe it 's real . It 's real . Let 's get down there . Get some gas and get down in there . What are those ? I guarantee you . This whole thing is a put-on . What do you want ? Get your hands off ! - How are you feeling ? - I feel fine ! the only bad air is from you guys farting around ! - Move them out ! - What 's happening ? - What ? Where are we going ? - Go to the van .

Where is Jillian ? Do you realize the danger you and your friend have risked ? you 've exposed yourself to toxic gas . I 'm alive . We 're talking . Mr. Neary . But if the wind blew from the south instead of the north this conversation would not be taking place . There 's nothing wrong with the air . What makes you say that ? I just know . There 's nothing wrong with it . Go outside and make me a liar . I wanna talk to the man in charge . Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority .

We 're gonna hold for a couple of minutes . You brought 12 people to the decontamination camp instead of the evacuation center where they belong . Why ? - Because this means something . - This means something . These people have come from all over their country to a place they 've been told will endanger their lives . Why ? Because somebody could be trying to subvert this whole operation ... cultists and Christ knows what all . Yes . Thank you very much .

How many of you people are for getting out of here ? I don 't know what 's happening either . I must find out what 's going on . anguished people who 've come here there must be hundreds touched by the vision who never made it here .

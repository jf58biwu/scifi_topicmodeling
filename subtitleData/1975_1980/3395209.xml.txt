 Have you got any biscuits over there ? Heres some cornbread . I am cold . - Still with us , Brett ? - Right . - Oh , I feel dead . - Anybody ever tell you you look dead ? Oh , yeah . Right ! I just forgot something , man . Before we dock , I think we ought to discuss the bonus situation . Brett and I , we think we deserve full shares . Mr Parker and I feel the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level . Yeah , I saw it . Yellow lights for my eyes only . OK , get dressed , huh ? Parker ? I havent finished my coffee . Its the only thing good on this ship . - Right ? - OK . Plug us in . Thank you . - Where is Earth ? - You should know . Its not our system . Scan . I cant believe this . Contact traffic control . This is commercial towing vehicle Nostromo , out of the Solomons , registration number 180924609 , calling Antarctica traffic control . Do you read me ? Over . Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo , out of the Solomons . Registration number 180924609 . - Nothing . - Keep trying . Calling Antarctica traffic control . Do you read me , Antarctica ? Over . Ive found it , just short of Zeta II Reticuli . We havent reached the outer rim yet . Thats hard to believe . What the hell are we doing out here ? Dont know . What the hell are you talking about ? Thats not our system . I know that . Do you ever notice how they never come down here ? This is where the work is , right ? Same reason we get a half share to their one . Our time is their time . Same old shit , man . I think I know why they dont come down . Its because of you . You have no personality . - You happen to be in my seat . Can I have it ? - Yes . Of course . Sorry . Whats happening now , baby ? Well , some of you may have figured out were not home yet . Were only halfway there . - What ? - Mothers interrupted ourjourney course . Why ? Shes programmed to do that should certain conditions arise . They have . It seems she has intercepted a transmission of unknown origin . - She got us up to check it out . - A transmission ? Out here ? What kind of a transmission ? Acoustical beacon that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds . - SOS ? - I dont know . - Human ? - Unknown . - So what ? - We are obligated under Section ... I hate to bring this up , but this is a commercial ship , not a rescue ship . - Right . - Its not in my contract , this kind of duty . And what about the money ? If you wanna give me some money , Id be happy to oblige . Lets go over the bonus situation . Im sorry , can I say something ? There is a clause which states Any systematized transmission indicating intelligent origin must be investigated ... I wanna go home and party . Parker , will you just listen to the man ? ... on penalty of total forfeiture of shares . No money . You got that ? - Well , yeah ! - Were going in . Approaching orbital apogee . Mark . Equatorial orbit nailed . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . dors in line . - Status on the lifters ? - Give me an AC pressure reading . 48 seconds and counting . Prepare to disengage from platform . 20 seconds . 18 , 17 ... 12 , 11 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , lock . Disengage . Clear . Moneys safe . Lets take her down . - Roll 92 degrees , port yaw . - Prime the port . Im not getting anything . Turbulence . Locked and floating . You can drop us anytime now . Initial dampings going off . Hold on , people , theres going to be a little bump . What the hell was that ? Pressure drop . Must have lost a shield . Lets go with it . Im still not getting anything . Yeah . Dropping off now . Still dropping . There we are , weve got it . Take her down . Navigation lights on . 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Kill drive engines . What the hell happened ? - Somebody give me an answer ! - Is the hull breached ? I dont see anything . We still have pressure . - Push the screen . - Why ? Secondary load-sharing unit is out . Three of the four cells are gone . - Is that it ? - No , hold on . We cant fix it out here anyway and we need to reroute a couple of these ducts . Dry-dock time . Dry-dock . Tell him to dry-dock ! We couldnt fix it out here anyway . Weve gotta reroute all these ducts . In order to do that , weve got to dry-dock . What else ? Some fragments caked up . Weve got to clean it out and repressurize it . How long before were functional ? - Look ... - 17 hours , tell her . At least 25 hours . Get started . Ill be right down . - What the hells she coming down here for ? - She better stay the fuck out of my way . Any response yet ? No , absolutely nothing , except the same transmission every 12 seconds . All the other channels are dead . Kick on the floods . We cant go anywhere in this . Mother says the sun rises in 20 minutes . - How far to the source of transmission ? - Northeast . Just under 2,000 meters . Walking distance ? - Can you give me an atmospheric ? - Yes . Its almost primordial . Theres inert nitrogen , high concentration of carbon dioxide crystals , methane ... - Im working on the trace elements . - Anything else ? Yes . Theres rock , lava base . Deep cold , well below the line . Ill volunteer to be in the first group to go out . Yeah , that figures . - You , too , Lambert . - Swell . Youd better break out the weapons . - I cant see a goddamn thing ! - Ash , are you receiving ? Good contact on my board . Clear and free . Keep the line open . Lets go . Hey , Ripley . Hey , Ripley , I want to ask you a question . If they find what theyre looking for , do we get full shares ? Dont worry , Parker , youll get whatevers coming to you . Im not gonna do any more work until we get this straightened out . Brett , youre guaranteed by law to get a share . - What ? - Why dont you just fuck off ? - What ? - What did you say , Rip ? If you have any trouble , III be on the bridge . Hey , Ripley , come back here ! - Son of a bitch . - Whats the matter ? Cant see a goddamn thing . Quit griping . - I like griping . - Come on , knock it off . Hows it going ? - Oh , all right . - Did you put the transmission through ECIU ? No . Mother hasnt identified it yet . - Mind if I give it a shot ? - Please do . - Ash , can you see this ? - Yes , I can . Ive never seen anything like it . Its very bizarre . You said it . All right . Moving on to second ... position . What is it ? Lets get outta here . Weve got this far . We must go on . We have to go on . Will you say that again ? Shit ! Ash , as you can see , its hard to describe . Im going back to the console . Dallas ! Come on down here . Theres something different here . I dont know what it is , but if we can get up that wall , we can find out . Alien life form . It looks like its been dead a long time . Fossilized . Looks like its grown out of the chair . Bones are bent outward . Like he exploded from inside . I wonder what happened to the rest of the crew . Lets get the hell outta here . Dallas ! Lambert ! Come on over here ! Come on . - What have you got ? - See what you make of this . Well , I ... It looks like a warning . - Im gonna go out after them . - Whats the point ? I mean , by the time it takes to get there , theyll know if its a warning or not . Yes ? Are you OK down there ? - Can you see anything ? - I dont know ... A cave . A cave of some sort , but I ... I dont know , but its like the goddamn tropics in here . What the hell is this ? The pit is completely enclosed . And its full of leathery objects , like eggs or something . Theres a layer of mist covering the eggs that reacts when broken . Kane ? Are you all right ? Yeah , lm OK . All right . Im OK , I just slipped . It appears to be completely sealed . Wait a minute , theres movement . It seems to have life . Organic life . - Are you there , Ripley ? - Im right here . - OK , Ripley . Im at the inner lock hatch . - Right . Are you there , Ripley ? Were clean , let us in . - What happened to Kane ? - Something attached itself to him . What kind of thing ? An organism . Open the hatch ! If we let it in , the ship could be infected . You know the quarantine procedure . - 24 hours for decontamination . - He could die . Open the hatch . Listen to me . We break quarantine , we could all die . Could you open the goddamn hatch ? We have to get him inside ! No . I cant , and if you were in my position youd do the same . Ripley , this is an order . Open that hatch , do you hear me ? - Yes . - Ripley , this is an order ! Do you hear me ? Yes . I read you . The answer is negative . Inner hatch open . What the hell is that ? How is he ? How are we gonna get that off of him ? - How are we gonna get it off ? - Just a minute ! III get some instruments . Right . Now , if I make an incision here to try and remove one of the digits from his face ... Youre gonna do what ? Finger . Ill try and get this finger off . Get this cleating on there ... - Its tearing his scalp ! - I know ! Well have to take a look at him inside . How come they dont freeze him ? How come you guys dont freeze him ? You can take your mask off . - Whats it got down his throat ? - I would suggest its feeding him oxygen . Paralyses him , puts him in a coma , then keeps him alive . What the hell is that ? - Weve got to get it off him . - Just a minute . Lets not be too hasty . We dont know anything about ... it . Were assuming its feeding him oxygen . If we remove it , it could kill him . Ill take that chance . Lets cut it off him now . - You take responsibility ? - Yes , yes . Get him out of there . Where do you want to do this ? Well make an incision just below the knuckle there . - Right here ? - Stand by . Good God ! That craps gonna eat through the hull . I think its going to eat through the goddamn hull . Come on ! Whats going on ? This way . Next deck . There it is . Dont get under it ! Looks like its stopping . Take a look at this , man . Brett , give me your pen . Give it to me , quick . Come on , come on ! Dont get any on your arm . Its stopped . I havent seen anything like that , except molecular acid . It must be using it for blood . Its got a wonderful defense mechanism . You dont dare kill it . What about Kane ? Heres your pen back . - What do we do now ? - Leave Kane to Ash . You get back to work . Oh ... What ... ? OK . Try it . - Damn it . I felt sure that was it . - Try it again . Feel like lve been in this place a month . We shouldnt have landed here in the first place . We shouldnt have landed on this damn ball , I know that . The sooner we patch this thing up and get outta here , the sooner we can go home . This place gives me the creeps . Its amazing . What is it ? Id say its , um ... I dont know yet . - Do you want something ? - Yes , I , uh ... A little talk . Hows Kane ? Hes holding . No changes . And , uh , our guest ? Well , as I said , lm still collating , actually . But I have confirmed that hes got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides . He has a funny habit of shedding his cells and replacing them with polarized silicone , which gives him a prolonged resistance to adverse environmental conditions . Is that enough ? Thats plenty . What does it mean ? - Please dont do that . Thank you . - Im sorry . Its an interesting combination of elements , making him a ... tough little son of a bitch . And you let him in . I was obeying a direct order , remember ? Ash , when Dallas and Kane are off the ship , I 'm senior officer . Oh , yes . I forgot . You also forgot the Science Divisions basic quarantine law . - No , that I didnt forget . - Oh , I see . You just broke it . What would you have done with Kane ? Hm ? You knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here . Unfortunately , by breaking quarantine , you risk everybodys life . Maybe I should have left him outside . Maybe Ive jeopardized the rest of us , but it was a risk I was willing to take . Its a pretty big risk for a science officer . Its not exactly out of the manual , is it ? I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you . You do yourjob and let me do mine . Yes ? - Wheres Dallas ? - In the shuttle . - Dallas . - You should have a look at Kane . - Why ? - Somethings happened . - Serious ? - Interesting . Ripley , meet me in the infirmary right away . - Where is it ? - Well , I dont know ! - We have to try and find it . - Lets check it . Dallas , please be careful . Sorry . No , not in the corner ! Have one of these . Just in case . Kane ? Are you OK ? - I didnt see it . Was it in the overhead ? - It was up there somewhere . - My God . - Cover the damn thing , will you ? Its alive . Excuse me . - It seems dead enough . - Good . Lets get rid of it . Ripley , for Gods sake , this is the first time weve encountered a species like this . It has to go back . All sorts of tests have to be made . Ash , are you kidding ? This thing bled acid . Who knows what it will do when its dead ? I think its safe to assume it isnt a zombie . Dallas , it has to go back . Id soon as not burn it at the stake , but youre the science officer . - Its your decision , Ash . - Dallas ! - You wont make me change my mind ... - Im not trying to change your mind . I just want you to listen ... Will you listen ? - How can you leave that decision to him ? - I just run the ship . Anything scientific , Ash has the final word . - How does that happen ? - Thats what the company wants . - Since when is that standard procedure ? - Standard procedure is to do what they say . Ever ship out with Ash before ? I went out five times with another science officer . They replaced him two days before we left Thedus with Ash . Hm ? - I dont trust him . - I dont trust anybody . - Whats happening with the repairs ? - Theyre pretty much finished . - Why didnt you tell me ? - Theres still some things to do . Like what ? Were blind on B and C decks , the reserve power systems blown ... Thats horseshit . We can take off without that . Dust in the intakes . Number twos overheating . Spit on it for two minutes , for Christ sake ! Were hot and were getting hotter . Engine room , red clip status . - One kilometer on ascension . - Engage artificial gravity . - Engaged . - Im altering the vector ... now . Inhibit CNG . - Struts retract . - Struts retracted . Walk in the park ! When we fix something , it stays fixed . Dont we , Brett , baby ? Right ! We should freeze him . If hes got a disease , why dont we stop it there ? - We can get to a doctor back home . - Right . Whenever he says anything , you say Right , Brett , you know ? Right . Parker , your staffjust follows you around and says Right ! Just like a parrot . - Shape up ! What are you , a parrot ? - Right . Come on , knock it off ! - Kanes gonna have to go into quarantine . - Yes , and so are we . - How about something to lower your spirits ? - Thrill me , will you , please ? According to my calculations , based on time spent ... - Give me the short version . How far to Earth ? - Ten months . Oh , God . Yes ? - Dallas , I think you should see Kane . - Has his condition changed ? - Its simpler if you come . - Were on our way . Right . How are you feelin ? - How are you doing ? - Terrific ! Next silly question ? Oh , thank you . Do you remember anything about the planet ? Whats the last thing you do remember ? I remember some horrible dream about smothering and ... Anyway , where are we ? - Right here ! - Were on our way home . Back to the old freezerinos ! - Ive got to have something to eat first . - I need something to eat myself . One more meal before bedtime . Im buying . Hey , thats a break ! The first thing lm going to do when I get back is to get some decent food . I can dig it . Ive eaten worse food than this , but then lve tasted better . You pound down the stuff like theres no tomorrow . Id rather be eating something else , but right now , lm thinking food . You should know , you know what its made of . I dont wanna talk about what its made of . Im eating this ! Whats the matter , man ? The food aint that bad , baby ! Whats wrong ? What ? What ? - This is serious . - Kane ! Get the spoon ! - Get it into his mouth ! - Im trying ! Oh , God ! - Dallas ? - Yeah . - Anything ? - No . You ? Nothing . - Did you see anything ? - No . Inner hatch sealed . Anybody want to say anything ? This is just an ordinary prod , like a cattle prod . Its got a portable battery . Its insulated from here to here . Just make damn sure nobody puts their hand on the end of it . It shouldnt damage the bastard unless its skin is thinner than ours . But it will give him a little incentive . Now we just have to find him . Ive taken care of that . Ive designed this tracking device . You just set it to search for a moving object . Hasnt got much of a range , but within a certain distance , it gives off a signal . What does it key on ? Micro changes in air density . Gimme a demo . See ? And again ... Gotcha . Two teams . Ash , Lambert and I. Ripley , you take Parker and Brett . Catch it , put it in the airlock , get rid of it . The channels are open on all decks . I want you to communicate , keep in touch at all times . Lets go . I thought you fixed 12 module . We did . I dont understand it . The circuits must have burned out . - What have we got here ? - Damn it , hold your light over here . Yeah , thats it . I dont know if this is going to work . - Put this in there . - Right . Check the insulation . Shit ... According to this , its within five meters . Open the door . Micro changes in air density , my ass . Its within five meters . Be careful . - Hey , dont creep up on me with that thing . - You guys stick together . - Whoa , whoa now ... - What ? Parker , Brett , its in this locker . In where ? Here , take it . I got it , I got it . Wait . All right , Parker ? When I say . - All right . Now . - Easy . - Dont let him go ! - What the hell are you doing , man ? ! Its the cat . Hey , look , now . We had to bag it . Now we might pick it up on the tracker again . - III ... Ill ... - Go and get it , man . You get him , well go on . Here , kitty ! Here , kitty , kitty . Kitty crap . Jones ! Jonesy ? Here , Jonesy ! Jonesy ? Here , kitty , kitty , kitty . Here , Jonesy ! Jonesy ? Here , kitty , kitty . Kitty , kitty , kitty . Jonesy . Jonesy . Jonesy ? Hey . Hey , come on , Jonesy . Come on , baby . Thats a kitty . Come on , baby . Thats a kitty . Hey , lm not gonna hurt you . Come on . Whatever it was , it was big . No question . Its ... Its using the air ducts to move around . Could he want Brett alive ? - What ? - Could Brett be alive ? No . I mean , I ... I dont think so . Now , this air shaft may work to our advantage . It leads up to and comes out in the main airlock . Theres only one big opening along the way . We can cover that up and then we drive it into the airlock and zap it into outer space . The son of a bitch is huge ! I mean , its like a man . Its big ! Kanes son . Come on , Ash . The science department should be able to help . How can we drive it ? Its adapted well to our atmosphere , considering its nutritional needs . But we dont know about temperature . - OK , temperature . What if we change it ? - Lets try it . Most animals retreat from fire . Fire , yeah . Parker , can you rig three or four incinerator units ? No . You and Ash , take the main airlock . Parker , Lambert , you cover up that maintenance opening , please . - Im at the firstjunction . - Dallas , lm right here . - Parker ? - Yeah . - Lambert ? - In position . Im trying to get a reading . - The airlock is open . - OK , Ripley . Ready . All right , lve got a reading on you now . Open the hatch to the third junction . Im moving on . Dallas , hold on . I think I got it . - Yes , lve got it . - Where ? Its somewhere around the third junction . OK . Moving on . It is right around there . Dallas , youre gonna have to be careful . All right . Ive reached the third junction and lm going down . What the hells the matter with that box ? Dallas , hold your position for a minute . I ... - Ive lost the signal ! - What ? You sure ? Are you sure its not there ? lts got to be around there . Check that out , Lambert . You may be getting interference . Dallas , are you sure theres no sign of it ? It is there ! Its gotta be around there ! Dallas ? All right . Am I clear ? I wanna get the hell outta here . Oh , God ! Lts moving right towards you . Move ! Get out of there ! Move ! Dallas ! Move , Dallas ! Move , Dallas . Get out ! No ! Not that way ! The other way ! Dallas ? - No . - Take it easy . Dallas ! We found this laying there . No blood . No Dallas . Nothing . - I dont hear anybody sayin nothing . - Im thinking . Unless somebody has got a better idea , well proceed with Dallass plan . What ? ! And end up like the others ? Oh , no . Youre out of your mind ! - You got a better idea ? - Yes . I say that we abandon the ship . We get the shuttle and get the hell out of here , and hope somebody picks us up . Lambert , shh . - The shuttle wont take four . - Then why dont we draw straws ? Im not drawing any straws . Im for killing it now ! OK . Lets talk about killing it . Its in the air shafts ... Will you listen to me , Parker ? Shut up ! Lets hear it . Lets hear it . - Its using the air shafts . - We dont know that ... Thats the only way ! Well move in pairs . Well go step by step and cut off every bulkhead and vent until we have it cornered , then well blow it the fuck out into space . Is that acceptable to you ? If it means killing it , yeah . But we have to stick together . This one needs refueling . Will you get it , please ? - Ash , go with him . - No , I can manage , Ash . Dont follow me . Ash ! Any suggestions from you or Mother ? No . Were still collating . Youre what ? Youre still collating ? I find that hard to believe . - What would you like me to do ? - Just what youve been doing , Ash . Nothing . Ive got access to Mother now , and III get my own answers , thank you . All right . There is an explanation for this , you know . I dont wanna hear your goddamn explanation ! Parker . Lambert ? Ash ! Will you open the door ? Let me by , Ash . What the hell are you doing ? Get her up ! Get her up , get her up ! Its an android ! Jesus ... Its a robot ! Ash is a goddamn robot . God ! Holy shit ! Help me get this fucking thing off ! God ... Oh , Jesus ... Oh , God . Oh , God . How come the company sent us a goddamn robot ? They must have wanted the alien for the weapons division . Hes been protecting it right along . - Parker , will you plug it in ? - Um ... I dont know ... Because he may know how to kill it . Ash , can you hear me ? Yes , I can hear you . What was your special order ? You read it . I thought it was clear . - What was it ? - Bring back life form , priority one . All other priorities rescinded . The damn company ! What about our lives , you son of a bitch ? ! I repeat , all other priorities are rescinded . How do we kill it , Ash ? Theres gotta be a way of killing it . - How do we do it ? - You cant . Thats bullshit ! You still dont understand what youre dealing with , do you ? The perfect organism . Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility . You admire it . I admire its purity . A survivor , unclouded by conscience , remorse , or delusions of morality . Look , lve heard enough of this and lm asking you to pull the plug . I cant lie to you about your chances , but ... you have my sympathies . Were gonna blow up the ship . Well take our chances in the shuttle . - Blow up the ship . - Good . Come on . When we throw the switches , how long do we have ? - Ten minutes . - No bullshit . Or else we wont need no rocket to fly through space . Well need coolant for the air support system . You two go down and get all the coolant you can carry . Ill get the shuttle ready . Ill give you about ... about seven minutes . Come back up here , III shut the switches off and well blow this fucker off into space . - Ready ? - Take care of yourself . Seven minutes . Take it easy . Jones ? Jones ? Jones ? - How are you doing ? - Fine . OK , go ahead . Jones ? Kitty , kitty , kitty . Come here , Jones , come here . Jones . Come here , boy . Come here . Nice kitty . Jones ? Jones ? Come here . Come here , sweetheart . Jones . Jones . Jones . Jones . Jones ! Goddamn it . Now lve got you . Come on , sweetheart . Nice kitty . Oh , my God ... - Get out of the way ! - I cant . Get out of the way ! Lts gonna kill us ! I cant ! - For Christ sake , get out of the way ! - Parker ... Lambert ... Get out of the way , Lambert ! Lambert ! Lambert ... Parker ... Get ready to roll !

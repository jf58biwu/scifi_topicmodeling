The winners Sveta Isinyova from Bukhara , Sasha Ivanenko from Donetsk , and Moscow student Fedya Druzhinyin are on their way to the Cosmonaut Training Center . Hey , kids ! The needle cactus and the wart cactus will blossom within one month Son , the needle cactus is more important . This species is rare to see blossom . If necessarily make a color photograph and draw it . When I return , you 'll show me . Bye ! On your places , guys ! Our commander . - Hello , kids . - Good day , Yegor Pavlovich . Today we are preparing for the start . I want to warn you of something . What ? - I also was a child . - What do you mean ? The desktop board has more than eight thousands of devices . I want you in flight no one is trying to " check out " if they operate . We all manage . If you are in need of help ... . - Did you say goodbye to your family ? - Of course . Then let 's go ! I left my hat in the locker room . If you would please ... Fedya . - Hey ! - Good afternoon . Did you hear the news ? Every day there is something . What do we have this time ? The general told me , that our Astra experiment ... Have a nice trip ! Well ... By joining the community of space astronauts , I swear that all my way I will keep the laws of the space-brotherhood And if necessary , I will not hesitate to risk my life to honor the Earth . With pure heart , I swear . Preparations - first step . Everyone out of the safe zone Stands retract Liftoff starts when the countdown reach zero . Ready for the countdown . 60 ... 59 ... 58 ... 57 ... 56 ... 55 ... 54 ... 53 ... 52 ... 51 ... 50 ... 49 ... 48 ... 47 ... 46 ... 45 ... 44 ... 43 ... 42 ... 41 ... 40 ... Yekaterina , I have ask on you . Go ahead , Yegor . Tell to my son that this month he does not need to irrigate the cacti , and in the next month only twice . 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Zero . Start ! Earth ! We 're going up , everything is fine . Heading for Gagarin 's orbit . Minor corrections have been made . Divergence as usual . - Gravitational force ? - Minimal . Alpha 110 , Beta 37 The 21 latitude circle was crossed . Keep the ship at this course . Go to stable orbit , according to the data from the Valentina satellite . Roger that . Roger ... Roger ... Good luck , Astra ! Good Bye . The Astra is in temporary orbit . Turning on automatic gravity system on Astra 's board . Gravity on . Hello . The take-off encephalogram data are excellent , as well as the emotional indicators . But Fedya Druzhinyin 's are not all that good . - The heart rate is too fast . - How ? Almost double the normal . - Weird . - Yes . I 've had no time to call you since we took off . It 's a lot of what we do . Now it is too late . Couple of days ago , at the take off it was a hell of noise at the start . The gokart-tournament is not even close to that . Just like a child 's play . When the rocket 's last stage was disconnected , it was as if all sound had been cut with a razor It was so quiet that it was scary . You only heard your heartbeat rate . Before going to bed I recall our evening city and the phone box where we used to meet . Do you know , Seryozhka , that the Earth is so beautiful and fascinating from here ? Eighth Day The flight continues successfully . Sasha Ivanenko 's encephalogram is excellent just as before , but the mutual understanding ... Did you called for me , Yegor Pavlovich ? Comrade Commander . We came as you wished , Comrade Commander . All right ... Well ... There is such a thing ... You know , it 's now the third day the food is " disappearing " . I do not like such pranks . We are only four of us on the boat . Sasha , shut down the module off ! Sveta , come from the right side ! Fedya , left side . Fourteenth Day What are you taking you are ruining . What are you giving you 'll get back . What 's new about the fewer ? - Is it bad ? - The temperature went to 39 degrees . The ship is now running around , waiting to make contact with Earth . I guess I panicked . What makes you so happy ? He is our commander ! Flying with him is as beeing in sanatorium . Everything is prohibited . Nobody is happy about anything . What do you think about this ? - Why pushing me ? - Like Nefertiti Queen ... Stop hammering me , won 't you ? Robin Hood ... We 'll be fine without his whistle aid . Hello , Earth ! Doctor , you know , that I 'm healthy . Captain , you have to keep immediately a 45 day strict quarantine . And no contact with the crew . Attention ! Crew , can you hear me ? We hear you well . You 're kidding or what ? In quarantine there are no devices , only books . I can not control the ship ! Due to illness of captain Kalinovskij , the Cosmonaut Training Centre delegated the commandship to Fedya Druzhinyin . Goodbye . Did you understand ? Hello , Earth ... I understood . I take the commandship of the vessel . - I do not want you to fly into . - Mom ... - I do not want to hear about it . - You do not understand anything ... I understand everything . More than 100 thousand attendands and you have been brought in the first three . I will not let you . And you tried to conceal it from me ? I never thought that I would win . I just wanted to try it myself . No way I let you in there . You always taught me that I 'm not a child anymore . Is not that right ? True . But you have to understand me ! After your father 's death I have only you . He always wanted me to be And now ... Do not leave me , my son ! I beg you ... Dad would let me go . What are we going to do ? The same as until now . Just better . The days in a sanatorium are over . # Step by step though , # Higher and more forward . # Takes us from the childhood # Gradually to adolescence # And soon it will come the moment , # When you have to decide . # And we were called for a journey # By the distant Milky Way # The night concern us with dreams # That are almost magical . # We 're rolling on a sledge # Through the Milky Way . # Although somewhat daunting , # The wind is quiet . # We are flying on a journey # To the distant Milky Way . Mom , I 'm sorry I came up on the fly . I could not do otherwise . Although , frankly , I regret it now . Then when I come back , I 'll tell why . We eat well , six times a day . We service for fifteen hours . A lot of work , but when you do it with friends , the time flies . We do everything we can to Yegor Pavlovich would be pleased . Yesterday he said with a smile , broad your horizons , and one member of the crew will make candidate disertation work . Fedya Druzhinyin still nervous . I don 't know what the reason is . In Belarus expected + 20 to + 23 ° C , without precipitation . Ukraine + 20 to + 25 ° C , Scattered rain . Central Russia + 18 to + 20 ° C and sunshine . The Ural area + 16 to + 18 ° C without precipitation . The Altai region + 20 ° C. The Habarovsky area ... Strange . We fly already 31 days but our flight was not even mentioned . You would expect they will tell every half hour news upon us ? I also have not heard a word . In Moscow , sunny day with rainless weather + 20 to + 23 ° C heat . It 's your fault that you missed the announcement of our status . - Did I not tell you ? - Yes . See ? You looked at the film . An academic talked about us . It was pretty funny . I will not pretend , to say , it is my opinion Now , despite they 're children , you can see a big , serious , to say , discussions , about , to say , conquering the galaxy . Attention ! The Astra has a gas leak . Gas leak on Astra . Follow me ! We have three minutes time ! Then it explodes and we 're done ! Sveta , you stay here ! Are you out of your mind ? Why did you stop the elevator ? Every second is worth gold ! Switch off all electricity ! A single spark could cause an explosion ! Don 't you understand , Commander ? Can you hear me ? - Hurry to the engine room ! - Two and a half minutes left ! Scared ? What 's the matter ? Someone out there is running . What ? There are only four of us on the ship . Nobody 's there . - It can 't be . - But I have seen . - You imagined it . - It was scary . I 'm sure you 're joking . The girls have always crazy visions . Maybe it happened to you . Let 's go . That 's strange ... This will be our commander . - Yegor Pavlovich . Are you in your room ? - Yes . Where else would I be ? What news of your illness ? I feel well . What 's going on at your house ? - Everything all right . - Why are you whispering ? We saw someone here , and we can not get to figure out who it might be . Do you see ghosts ? We have enough serious problems . Care about work and not about nonsense ! Over . You have heard what Yegor Pavlovich said ? Dear Alexandra Mikhailovna I 'm sorry that I did not answer the recent letter . Please accept my heartfelt good wishes to the team I remember how you took me to the contest in Moscow . We were sitting in the garden , eating strawberries . I have not forgotten the teachings . I 'd like to teach the boys to dance . On Astra , there are lot of interesting things happening , it is a bit like a fairy tale . Even flying too ! Yesterday we activated the third main reactor . - We enter a meteor shower . - That 's all right . This is not the first time . 9 : 4 It 's size is 200 million square kilometers . That 's average size . Turn on shields , that 's it . It 's now 10 : 4 . Wonderful sight . Sveta . What 's the cabin temperature ? Thirty degrees Celsius . As in Caucasus . It is really hot . Temperature of the casing ? 600 degrees . Above normal . The meteor field ... The speed of ... Speed of Astra ... We wont get beyond the boundary of the meteor shower . Why not ? The vessel will melt . That 's mathematics . - Lobachevskiy . - Pythagoras . And Sofia Kovalevskaya . Check it out . Increase the maximum . Trouble ... You are sure about this meteor shower ? Do what you want . - Fyodor ! - I 'm thirteen years old Fyodor ! Fedya , you 're our commander . Your mother should know the scientific importance of the flight . How the child 's body behaves in space . She does not care if it is her own son . That 's her . - I forgot her name . - Zoya Petrovna . " Don 't worry , Masha . I 'm Dubrovsky . " Don 't push to much at first ! Hello , Zoya Petrovna ! Excuse me , please ... - You are Svetlana Isinyova , right ? - Yes . I know you You 're the winner of the three . Yes . - Do you mind ? - But not for long . Please forgive me ... Most likely you have come to persuade . The women understand each other better word . Really ? You think so ? The adults already carried out many flights . They are adults . How old are you ? Thirteen . - And you go up into space ? - Yes . - Your parents allowed that ? - Yes . You really oppose it ? Very against it . Take a deep breath ! Now let 's leave Sochi . A was little tired . But everything will be fine . - Sasha , contact with Earth ! - Yes . Earth ! Earth ! Meteor shower ! Can you hear me ? We hear you Astra . What is the swarm 's speed ? More than 100 thousand km / h . We can not stand . What measures have you done ? We will proceed according to the rules of the asteroid zone . Module . Resistance . - How much ? - 850 . Critical . People are cooked by much less . Splitter . I got it . Turn it up ! It does not work . Now there is no hope anymore . Here is the end . What a pity ... What a pity to die at the age of 13 ... At age of 37 it would not feel any better . - Forgive me ... - For what ? How much I protested , did not agree and talked back . It works ... I swear , it works ! # The race is not for the weak ones . # The race is not for the fearful ones . # With any turn # Drama may come any time . # In life , too , # There are many of turns . # You need to learn # To overcome them . # Do not slow down on curves # Only so you learn how to win . # To win ! Astra ! Astra ! Can you hear me ? Earth , we hear you well . We successfully passed the meteor shower . Then Sasha suggested to dismantle and repair the shield module . And who did that ? - Sasha . - Why did you not say anything to me ? We forgot . What does that mean ? We have forgotten , we were afraid . We 're sorry . And what does the rest of you kids doing now ? Rest . - Well , all right . Goodbye . - Goodbye . Svetlana Isinyova normal breathing , the electrocardiogram has no change . In Moscow is now midnight . So from the beginning . Fedya , do not listen to your feet ! - Maybe I should listen to my stomach ? - Listen to your heart . Look ! Ready ... And ... one , two , three , four ... Hilarious ! And ... one , two , three , four ... And ... one , two ... # Maybe one day the fairy tales # From our Earth will by gone . # We 'll be riding to the stars # Like on a pair of brown horses . # There , in the new strange worlds # New tales will be found . # We bring them back to Earth # With a couple of brown horses . Every member of the staff ! Astra is closing to a space station . Attention ! A further problem . On our track there is another ship . We are meeting them . - Let us not disgrace ourselves . - Lights turn on . It is possible that they are in trouble , and therefore came off their driving course . I have automatic signals from the interplanetary space station . They are asking for help . Which means , there may be no one on board . We 'll proceede according to the situation . We have to contact Earth , or at least Yegor Pavlovic . It will take us off course and we never get back to our orbit Who 's in charge here ? I insist , Commander ! It 's too big risk ! " Don 't wory , Masha . I 'm Dubrovsky . " We go to manual flight control , and turn on brake mode . Did you understand ? Yes . Then we go to the station and check for the situation . - Sasha , go to manual control ! - All right ! Sveta , sign up our coordinates ! Ready ? Yes . Constellation Canis Major . ( Constellation Great Dog ) Alpha Canis - 230 degrees , 30th quadrant . Beta Canis - 21 degrees , 76th quadrant . Epsilon Canis - 180 degrees , 49th quadrant . I got it . Starting automatics : approach and docking . I got it . Turn on the station 's oxygen supply ! Done . Approaching ! Finalising . Docking . Oxygen supply to the station is running . Good job . I 'd like to thank the crew for the excellent work ... . with an ... ice cream . Fedya . Let me go to the station to fix their problems ! " The Iroquois will go to the war road " - Hawkeye said . Everyone stays here I 'm going to the station . You are watching and keep contact to Yegor Pavlovich . Today - walnut ice cream . - Where is the commander ? - In front , on a horseback . Bye-cocoa ... BLOCK 1043 Hey ... Hey ! No one is here , right ? This is P-8 block . Do you hear me ? What kind of help do you need ? Just a little work . All right . I 'm going back now . Do you copy ? We understand . Come back , we wait . Hello ! Fedya , why don 't you answer ? What kind of joke is this ? Hello ! Fedya ? What happened ? What happened ? The ship itself is amazing . Just think , Sasha . Cinema , greenhouse , library , pool , everything . And no weightlessness , there is constant gravity . Hello , Fedya ! Where are you ? What happened ? Can you hear us ? I have to go to the station , to find out what happened to him . Are not you afraid to stay alone ? Just a little Sasha . But I handle it . You know , I can not leave Fedya . Bye-cocoa . Cocoa-bye . # Your face is burning # From the wind speed . # Towards us is hurtling # The racing track # Who can not take a risk , # Will never win . # Whether racing or life # There is no difference . # Do not slow down on curves # Only that way you learn how to win . # To win ! Fedya ! Sveta , I 'm here . How are you ? Fine . Where is Fedya ? He 's not here . - Sasha ! - Yes ? - What 's new ? - I don 't understand anything . I looked everywhere . Fedya is not here . As if he disappeared in the air . Sasha . Sashenyka ... EMERGENCY CONTACT TO EARTH I don 't understand anything . We met an interplanetary space station . Astra docked to it . Why ? For assistance . All right . And then what ? Fedya went to the station and did not return . Sasha went to look , but he did not come back either . What do you suggest , Sveta ? I have to go to the station . There can not remain only one astronaut on Astra 's board . Should I leave the boys by themselves ? ! Undock the station immediately and follow the designated path . But what about the boys ? When the station reaches in connection limit we will bring them back to Earth . Try to tell boys this by other communication channels . Hello ! Astra is calling the space station ! Can you hear me , boys ? Do you hear me ? Hello ... # One winter , I saw # How the lilac bloom # Like as in May . # Do you believe me ? # Do you believe me , do you ? # Be sure I believe you # I have no doubt . # I saw all that myself # It will remain our secret . # Our secret . - It 's me , Yegor Pavlovich . - I hear you . I need to see you . You must not , Sveta . The boys are in trouble but they ordered me to leave the station and go on without them . The command from Earth is supreme . The first rule for the cosmonauts . - You know , Sveta . - Yes , I know . But there are other unwritten rules of the camaraderie : Never leave your friends when in trouble . Yegor Pavlovich . Yegor Pavlovich ! You should decide for yourself . Now you 're in charge . Ask your question . Did someone left the station in the last hour ? You didn 't give the code . I shouldn 't answer you but I 'm bored of lack of exercise . By solving a quantum electronics problem you get the correct code I give you the instructions . But I did never solve such a formula . What a pity . Then I can not help you in any way . You are machine , you should obey the man . To give the instructions or not I do not understand you . Let 's go . The wavelength of the laser pulse is 1 microsecond , the frequency is 3 kilohertz , power is 1 kilowatt , the ratio of helium and neon in active medium is forty to one , pressure is 0.02 millimeters of mercury . At what scale should the magnetron work to induce the change in the plasma - You 've got the instructions ? - Yes . I 'm sensing a change . What is it ? You 'll soon find out Do not worry ! Ask . Darling , would you solve me a quantum mechanical problem ? Enter a question . The laser pulse wavelength 1 microsecond ... The answer is in my memory . I know the problem . Ask more . In the last hour , did someone leave the station ? No All systems on the station are working normally ? Currently , yes How many people are in the station ? - Three astronauts . - Where are they ? Two of them are in the cooling chamber nr . 1043 , and one is next to me . Thanks for the information . Bye-cocoa , dearie . I do not understand . I do not understand ... Boys ! Well , everyone together again . Boys ? We 'll freeze completely . " We are trapped , musquetiers " - Said D 'Artagnan . There 's no way out . NITROGEN I think , first of all we should warm up . Prepare and ... In the cooling section is a corridor in the event of an emergency slide . Which means , there is here an exit to the space . There is certain death waiting for us out there . What do you suggest ? Nothing . There is only one solution . One of us has to go into space and to try to get to Astra 's emergency entrance . I suggest we draw straws . Sveta is out , of course . Me ? Why ? Space float is not for girls . Marco Polo ... Outside are minus 150 degrees . Vacuum and radiation . And we have no space suits . But we must do something ! I said no . It makes no sense . No one is going anywhere while I 'm in charge . And to stay here , this does makes sense ? To freeze within a few hours . Come on , Fedya , lets draw straws ! Or are you scared , Commander ? Me ... ? You ... you ... Well , if you want to know ... If it wasn 't me , the entire flight ... - How did you get here ? - How , how ... If it was successful , we can do it too . Hey ! Is anyone there ? How did it got here ? - The kitten was on Astra . - We 'll find out . Follow me ! Attention ! The crew is sliding through the hallway leaving the cooling chamber . Turn of the projector screens in the whole area of the space vessel . Turning of the flight simulation . Support stuff ! Everybody get ready for the evacuation of the crew ! Attention ! The Astra experiment is completed ! What is this ? What happened ? Our flight should be of scientific significance for the world ... They really did misled us for one and a half months ? I knew from the first day , that this is not true . That we will not fly . I realized that , when I went back for Yegor Pavlovich 's hut . - So you were the whole time pretending ? - Are not you ashamed of yourself ? I did not lie . I just kept it . Otherwise , none of us would have gone through the final testing ground ! But one day we 're going to fly , boys . You bet . Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov Perhaps many of you are disappointed , that you didn 't saw a real space travel in the film . Don 't be sad . It was a reason for that . Each of us astronauts had huge work to be carried out , before to go to the cosmos . The flight makes use of the full human strength , knowledge , experience . I stayed only 12 minutes in open space . But I can say , that every minute I spent in space was preceded by one year of preparation on Earth . But I 'm sure kids the time is near , when you , if you want , you will fly in space . I believe in it . THE END

 ♪ ♪ [ Dixieland jazz ] TIME TRAVELERS [ March ] [ Siren Wailing ] We drove in right behind you , got a look at her when you were unloading . What happened ? - She just fainted . That 's all . But when the parade ambulance came by , I thought I ought to bring her here . Excuse me , Doctor . My orders were to bring you directly to Doctor Stafford 's office . All right , Sergeant . You brought me here . I know where to find him . The youngsters get so excited marching in a Mardi Gras . And of course they never eat properly so far away from home . What you think it is , the flu ? - Wait a minute . You said something . " So far away from home . " She 's from New Orleans , isn 't she ? Well , I am , but Betty here is from Oregon . Our service club has an honor band . Two music honors students from each state of the union . From each state ? Why ? What 's wrong ? I 'm Dr. Clinton Earnshaw from the university . I want you to run a blood test on her immediately . Don 't be scared , Betty . They 're gonna take good care of you here . I want you to put her in the X. B. room . I want him in there too . And don 't forget , fumigate her clothes . Thank you . Is it ? - Looks like you have another one , Dr. Stafford . That 's 14 here at Bayou and six more at St. Mary 's . How many are still alive ? - The last report I gave the governor ... said there was only a 40 % mortality rate . " Only 40 % . " I suppose you don 't know how many are still being diagnosed ... as scarlet fever , or snakebite or sunstroke ? - No way . Let me tell you something , Doctor. lf I were public health director of this state - If you were public health director of this state , I know , you 'd quarantine the city ... and lock up a halfa million visitors from all over the world . Well , you can 't let them scatter . Not until we 've found some way to isolate that virus , if it is a virus . Not until we 've found some way to stop it . Sure , sure . With a quick and easy cure for a deadly disease that 's so obscure ... it isn 't even in the textbooks anymore . And all you specialists have been able to do is to give it a new name , " X. B. " What do you suggest we name it , panic , hysteria ? Oh , I 'm sorry , Clint . I am too . Only , why did you have to send a police sergeant to drag me all the way over here ... just when I have every lab at the university working . Clint , Washington called . They 've sent us some high-powered help , so they claim . Thank God . Who did they send ? - A fella named Adams . [ Snoring ] Are you there ? Handy little trick , instant sleep . Particularly when you haven 't had it in the last couple of days . This is Dr. Clinton Earnshaw , the pathologist ... who first recognized the symptoms of our epidemic . Oh , yes . I know all about Dr. Earnshaw . Graduated from medical school at 23 - - I think we can skip that . Hello , Dr. Adams . [ Chuckles ] I 'm no doctor . You can just call me jeff . I 've barely got an M. A. This may come as a surprise to you , Mr. Adams ... but we told H. E. W. our biggest need was for bacteriologists and virologists . Yeah , well , uh ... I had an athletic scholarship once to this little cow college , if you can fathom that . But , uh , never mind that . We haven ? got much time . Let 's go . - I 'm not going anywhere , Mr. Adams . He just wants your attention for a few hours , Clint . I can 't even spare minutes , Doctor . With all due respect , I doubt very much ... if there 's any way at all that Mr. Adams can help us . Your problem is X. B. , right ? Symptoms similar to " cardinalia , " woods fever , " scarabus toxicana , " All thought to be as extinct as the passenger pigeon . But now the disease is back again . So unless you 've found a cure in the last couple of hours - Well , have you ? - No , we haven 't . Hmm . Well , then , let 's do it together maybe , huh ? Come on . There 's a jet waiting at the airport . It 's a White House jet , Doctor . Please don 't argue . All right , now that we 're alone , maybe you 'll explain all this . Adams ? - [ Snoring ] That is a handy little trick . [ Continues Snoring ] We 'll be landing soon . Two more hours . That instant sleep stuff really works . I learned it during astronaut training . What happened , you flunk out ? When I discovered I was too young for the moon program , and too old for Mars ... I applied for something a little more exciting , that 's all . Like what ? - Well , it 's , uh ... a science foundation thing . Pretty specialized . Now we only have this one little research center . You 'll see . - What does all this have to do with my problem ? With a blossoming epidemic that may soon threaten this whole country ? Did you ever hear of a G. P. named Henderson ... Dr. joshua P. Henderson ? - From Illinois . He 's one of the few doctors who ever accurately described these same symptoms of X. B. And he 's the one who called it woods fever , right ? He lived over a hundred years ago , Mr. Adams . They blamed the dense forest for a lot of things they had in those days . I know . But he described the symptoms of 27 cases . And he also managed to keep all but two of those cases alive , right ? That 's what other doctors claimed , yes . Unfortunately , all of Dr. Henderson 's records ... were burned up in the Chicago fire in 1871 , so - Wouldn 't it help you to know what was in those records ? To know how Dr. Henderson cured those cases of X. B. ? Of course it would . For your information , medical historians ... have been digging into that puzzle for years without any luck at all . So unless somehow , miraculously ... you have discovered Dr. Henderson 's diaries in the last couple of hours - Well , have you ? I 'm afraid the only personal effect of Henderson 's that was ever found ... was ... this gold watch . It was given to him by his wife in 1854 . The Chicago Museum loaned it to me . It has a rather beautiful inscription on the back . " To my beloved , my most beloved husband . " Adams , I 'm really not interested in the mementos of a man who 's been dead over a hundred years . Of course . But wouldn 't you like to talk to Dr. Henderson ? Ask him a few medical questions , perhaps ? [ Doorbell Rings ] Hi , come on in . We 're just about ready for you . Dr. Earnshaw , Dr. Sanders . - Helen . Nice to meet you . How do you do ? He likes degrees . She 's got five . Caltech , Oxford - - Cut it out jeff . Would you like some coffee , uh , Clint , is it ? - No , thank you . I had some on the plane . - Good . We 're on a tight schedule anyway . I was gonna put a Thermos in here , but - - That is a thing of beauty . The boys certainly have worked fast . - What is that ? Why , it 's a medical bag . Look , everything 's Victorian . The 1870s , exactly as it should be . Only , uh ... see in here ? It 's transistorized . It has enough power to run for five hours . A miniaturized centrifuge ? - And we thought you might want to do a blood analysis ... so we put a special microscope in there too . Only , for heaven 's sakes , don 't let anyone back in Chicago get a look at these . Back in ... Wait a minute . What 's going on here ? When you made that crazy crack about talking to man who 's been dead for over a hundred years ... I thought you meant in a séance or some other nutty spiritualist thing . He didn 't tell you that we do time research here ... that you 're going to travel back in time to 1871 ? I 'm what ? [ Sighs ] Oh , jeff , really . I 'm sorry , but I was afraid you might just jump out the plane . I mean , I know if I were in your shoes , and somebody I never heard or ' ... said we 're gonna go back a hundred years - I think it 's time he meets the boss . Dr. Earnshaw , Dr. Cummings . I guess you have heard of Dr. Amos Cummings . I was under the impression that you 'd moved to Africa , Doctor . No , no , no . I just moved out of NASA . Ran away from my chair in physics . Oh , what a relief . That 's a strange reaction from a Nobel Prize winner . Not at all . I just got rid of specialization ... that 's all . Now I can start at the beginning ... examine the whole tree of knowledge . Dr. Cummings . [ Chuckles ] Are you actually claiming that you can transport me back ? Well , I 'll be with you . I 'm going too . Snoring all the way , I suppose . Now , look ... I 'll go along with any experiment if it makes any sense . But this is absolutely ridiculous . I , uh , think I heard him say " yes " , didn 't you ? Yes , I did . Dr. Earnshaw , my computers are on a very tight schedule . [ Adams ] These are the memory banks . The main part of the city back in those days was down here on the South Side . Everything quite close to Lake Michigan . There might be great value in going back in time , I suppose ... if we could correct our mistakes . - No . That 's the one thing you can 't do . You can 't change history . Dr. Henderson lived up here on the North Side ... a nice , quiet rural area back then . That 's where we 'll be arriving , the first thing we 'll see . Just tell me one thing . Has anybody ever done this before ? Have they ? - Of course . Four of us have gone back already , a lot farther than Chicago . There 's nothing to it . Jeff , I , uh , think it 's time we tell him the whole story . Only three of those men came back alive . What happened to the fourth ? He came back 20 minutes late . He was decomposed ... with an arrowhead embedded in his back . 30.000 years old . Don 't ask me how or why ... because I don 't even know yet . So we 're really just guinea pigs . - No . We 're all just human beings . And all we have to face the future with ... is the experience of our past . Unfortunately , there are only remnants left ... of our history , our knowledge . Wouldn 't you like to find some of that lost knowledge ? We go through here . Hey , fellas . Safe journey . Four days . We 'll have four days there . That should be plenty of time . From October 4 - - lf we lose four days , that epidemic - We could be in the past a whole month and it wouldn 't take away any time from the present . How could it ? - [ Cummings On P. A. ] Gentlemen ... we are 1 O seconds from the start of countdown . - We 're ready , sir . Dr. Earnshaw ? - Yes , I 'm still here . He 'll be fine , sir . Let 's go . [ Whirring ] [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] So is this it ? A nice , quiet rural area on the North Side ? Where are we , downtown what ? New York , Cleveland ? It can 't be Chicago . It 's too hot for this time of year . They had a heat wave in October of 1871 . No , this is Chicago , all right . " CB Q. " " Chicago , Burlington and Quincy " . And that sign . " Great Lakes Dry Goods . " That means Lake Michigan . So the computers made a little mistake . A couple of miles ' error in latitude and longitude , that 's all . Sure , Randolph Street . State Street maybe . We 'll have to leave from the exact same spot where we arrived ... back there at the railroad station . Did you hear me , Clint ? - What ? We 'll have to leave back there from the railroad station . We 'll get a room at the Palmer House . We 've only got four days to get all the information we want . Well , that should be plenty of time once we find Dr. Henderson . Well , just remember , you 're Dr. Clinton Earnshaw of Washington D. C. If you tip your real identity - - They 'll put us in a padded cell . Leff , I don ? believe it . We 're really here . I don 't believe it . - [ Chuckles ] Maybe now you 'll understand why I quit the astronauts . I fell in love with history . It 's where the people are . Jeff , look at this . The latest dispatch from Stanley . He 's in Africa on his way to look for Livingston . What 's the matter ? - Is this date a misprint ? No , no . That 's today 's paper , just out . Today is Saturday , October 7th ? - Well , sure , mister . Jeff , what 's the matter ? - Those computers , I should 've guessed ... when they dumped us in the wrong place . We should 've been here October 4 , remember ? What difference does that make ? We still have four days to find Dr. Henderson . No , you 're wrong , Clint . In less than 29 hours , this whole city is gonna be in flames . He wants an ice ? - There 's chicken in there . I don 't want it to spoil before he gets a chance to eat . And I know he won 't eat unless you get , uh , reminding him . I just don 't know if there 's any ice left in the whole hospital today . Oh , hold on , gentlemen . You mustn 't go in there . I ' ! be over in a moment . Dear , there 's always ice on the second floor of medicine storage . Well , go on . See what they want . Jane , we 're waiting . - Poor girl . They leave her all alone on a Saturday afternoon . No training , practically brand-new from the old country . Go back there , because it 's restricted . It 's very contagious . Jane , I thought you said you only wanted to stop by and leave the food . Shh . That man said " Henderson " , didn 't he ? Excuse me . Lakeside Hospital , Dr. Joshua P. Henderson . Excuse me . I 'm his niece Jane Henderson . You 're a doctor too , aren 't you ? Yes , I am . How did you guess ? Oh , I don 't know . Your bag . - Oh . [ Chuckles ] [ Adams ] Well , is he here ? It 's urgent . The surgeon general sent us all the way from Washington D. C.just to see him . This is Dr. Earnshaw . My name is Adams . - How do you do ? General . Oh , yes , gentlemen . This way , sirs . I 'll see if I can find him . - No . You really shouldn 't , dear . Uncle josh is with his fever patients . That 's where he 's been for the past 24 hours . Fever patients ? - Woods fever , it ' ; cal / ed . There 's been a small outbreak here . But many of the doctors referred their cases to my uncle . They all claim that it 's the terrible heat and walked away ... but of course it 's because they really just don 't know what to do about it . If you could just tell us where he is . We 're in a hurry . And so are we , jane . Oh , I 'm sorry , Clarence . I 'm terribly sorry , but I knew I shouldn 't have left my uncle all alone today . Please tell the others ... forgive me . I 'm a nurse , gentlemen . Come along , and I 'll show you the way myself . [ Spits ] I told you to swallow that stuff . Liquor . There 's liquor in there . Red liquor , the blood of the devil . That was a pill in there . Leave me , temptation . For the Lord sayeth unto me - He wouldn 't waste his breath . Now open . Now whistle your hornpipe , sailor . [ Gagging ] [ Chuckles ] There now . That didn 't hurt a bit , did it ? May the Lord forgive you . His name 's Sharkey , Doc . Told me he went to one of them camp meetings the other night . " Joined in grace " , he said . - Don 't try to talk , son . I heard the worn ' . I seen the light Hallelujah . Sir , it helps me to talk , Doc . Keeps me from thinking about things , like my wife and kid back in Texas . I used to be a sinner like all the rest of you . And then I learned the evils of women ... and whiskey and chewing ' tobacco . Sharkey , you 'll be a corpse if you don 't quit yowling ' . Yeah , shut up , you old bum . - Shame on you , all of you ! Stop it ! What in the hell are you doing back here ? Never mind , ma 'am . For he that useth profanity ... shall burn in the flame eternal ! Oh , shut up . I know you don 't want water . These gentlemen would like to see you , Doctor . All right , all right . Soon as I get rid of this last pill here . They 're from Washington . The surgeon general sent them . Oh . [ Chuckles ] Well , I won 't hold that against you , gentlemen . How is the old busybody ? Fine , sir . He sends you his best wishes . Uncle josh , this is Mr. jeffrey Adams . How do you do ? - Pleasure , Doctor . And this is Dr. Clinton Earnshaw . How do you do , Doctor ? - How do you do ? Oh , one of those new ... disinfectant nuts to boot maybe , huh ? Your niece did say this was an emergency contagious ward , Doctor . That 's right , all woods fever in here . All but me , I 'm immune . - Do you know why , Doctor ? How you got your immunity , that 's one of the things we came here to find out . I don 't claim to know . That sailor over there would probably say ... it has something to do with my relationship with the devil maybe . And , uh , that reminds me . Couldn 't they have found their way up here by themselves ? I told that young man of yours to keep you out of this hospital during this blasted heat wave . Make you go out and have some fun for a change . Oh , you did ? And all just because Clarence told you ... that he may run for alderman , I suppose . My uncle , you see , has visions of marrying me to someone respectable ... like a lawyer or a politician . And of course , it is quite improper for a single lady to be nursing in a hospital ... where she might meet other sorts of men , even doctors . - [ Scoffs ] - [ Man ] Doc , Doc . I 'm coming , Mr. Younger . You 'll have to excuse my niece , gentlemen . She 's inclined ... to have a little bit of a big mouth sometimes . It runs in the family . - I kind of like it , Doctor . Oh ? Oh ? Doctor , we don 't have much time . We can only stay here one day . Yes , Doctor ... what medications do you use to effect your cures ? What was that pill you just gave that man ? [ Chuckling ] A little bit of quinine and calomel . Puts a little buzzing in their ears , makes ' em rest somewhat easier maybe . That wouldn 't do anything . Doctor , you sound like a chef who doesn 't want to give away his favorite recipe . Why ? Please , help us , Doctor . It 's vital . All right , sure , sure . Sure , I 'll help you . Bed rest and sleep , that never hurt anybody . Quinine , calomel washed down with a little elderbeny wine ... now there 's three old favorites to keep folks from realizing how sick they really are . With maybe a little liver remedy , snake oil thrown in for good measure . What the hell , do you think I 'm hiding something ? Gentlemen , I 'll show you anything ... help anyway I can . I just wish to God I could do more . You see , I - I just plain don 't know ... why my patients live . There you are . I don 't know , but maybe this will help . It 's all he wants . Well , first he makes blackberry syrup ... like they used to for cholera and summer complaint . And then he soaks the currants , adds citron , angelica - Wait a minute . I missed something . Does he make a poultice of this ? No , this , the cake . I just said that he makes the recipe up himself . I 'm sorry , I - " A good doctor " , he says , " should also be able to paint a picture or shoe a horse . " I guess I don 't qualify then . I 'm not very good with horses . [ Rooster Crows ] Or chickens either , as a matter of fact . [ Chuckles ] Where do you come from ? Besides hospitals . I think we should get back downstairs . Clinton , tell me . What do you do besides medicine ? I mean , do you climb mountains , go sailing , fishing ? Exploring in the wilderness ? None of that . I guess there are quite a few things I 've just never taken the time for . How about you ? What do you mean ? - Like Clarence that your uncle wants you to marry . What ? No . That 's just because when I was a little girl ... I had such silly dreams about a young surgeon who went off and joined the army . What I mean is Uncle josh is just absolutely scared to death that - Well , that I 'll marry a doctor someday . Well , I 'm all ready . Let 's go . - [ Bell Telling ] Wait a minute . What 's that ? Oh , it 's matins . Time for early church services . God , we 've taken a whole half hour . - Taken ? I thought I 'd just been given a whole half hour . [ Tolling Continues ] Good , good . Well , you 're looking a lot less feverish this morning . How do you feel ? Well , you 're gonna be all right . Gonna be all right . All right , young man . I 'll take over here . You go get some rest . I 'm all right , Doctor . - Yeah ? Yep , that 's what I told the surgeon general . The surgeon general ? - Yeah , I just sent the old busybody a telegram ... saying thanks for sending you and your friend here . You 've been a big help , son . I 'd wish you could stay around Chicago a little while longer . Well , I 'm afraid we can 't , Doctor . - Well . All right , scoot , scoot . Get some rest . I did want to put another cold pack on the johnson girl , Doctor . I 'll do that . By the way , uh ... have you checked with your niece down in the men 's ward ? It seems that she 's having a little problem with that noisy sailor . He wants to get out and go to a camp meeting someplace . - [ Scoffs ] Blasted nuisance . I 'll go down there and kick him out . He 's almost cured anyway . Well ? - So far , he hasn 't missed on one diagnosis . Everyone I 've checked has X. B. , all right . You mean that 's all you 've learned ? How many times do I have to say it ? Today is Sunday . Between 8 : 30 and 9 : 00 , that fire 's gonna start . That 's tonight . Tell me something . How many cures for woods fever have you come up with ... in the last couple of hours going through Henderson 's records ? I 've found nothing in his records . - Right . So far , I 've checked 20 blood samples ... from a patient already dead to the newest , a little girl . Do you know how to take blood samples ? - Part of my training . What I don 't have is a sample from somebody who 's already been cured . The comparison . That 's how I ' ! find our answer . That sailor Sharkey walked out of here a couple of minutes ago . He was completely recovered . Give me the syringes . Where was the sailor headed ? - He was going to another camp meeting . I overheard somebody saying in a part of town called " The Patch . " I know where that is . I. ' [ Piano ] [ Barking ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] Well , well , Mr. Sharkey , I believe . What a pleasure to find you , sir . Perhaps you saw me at the hospital , remember ? My name is - Never mind , mate . I 'm in a hurry . I 'm on my way to glory . Well , then , so am I. Don 't mind if I walk along with you , do you ? - l do . The road to salvation should be traveled alone , sir . Oh , amen to that , sir . Will it stop now and then for a drink maybe ? Like back there at a place called Barney 's ? I only had water in that vile place . What are you doing , man , following me ? - Sharkey , I need your help . No , no , let me go . Let me go . I 'm late for - for hymn singing . Now , listen to me . I have a proposition for you . - No ! Sharkey - Does money mean anything to you ? Now , that is a pretty sight . What is it you 'd be wantin ' me to do ? I could always use a little bit more gold for the collection plate . Now , I 'm a doctor , you understand . So you 've nothing to worry about . And you 've been miraculously cured of a very dangerous disease . So now , I 'm gonna give you a chance to help save a thousand - maybe even a million souls . - What 's that thing ? You 're the only one who can do it , Sharkey . I 'll pay you anything you like . Sharkey , I 'm sure some doctor must have bled you at some time ... for the pox , or some other disorder ? Now , this is simply a new form of - Sharkey ! [ Dogs Barking ] Need some help ? Oh , uh , yes . Yes , Officer , I was just , uh - This man seems to be in some sort of trouble . Can 't you get him to his feet ? Or did you put him there ? - Of course not . I suppose we better ask him about that . Seems out cold . Gimme a hand , will ya ? - Yes , he did seem to be drunk . What 's that in your hand ? [ Policeman Whistling ] [ Whistling Continues ] [ Whistling ] Did you see him ? The gent . - He turned in here . What 'd he do ? He murdered a man . There 's a sailor back there , and he 's dead . [ Whistling Resumes ] - [ Whistling ] - [ Grunts , Sighs ] No . No ! I ca - I can 't . No . [ Muttering ] No , you can 't . No . No . No , f - - Clinton , wake up . - [ Muttering ] - It 's all right . Wake up . What ? - [ Chuckles ] You must have been having a terrible dream . You were sleeping so soundly . - Oh . I was dreaming about this little girl . She was burning up with fever , and I couldn 't do anything about it . Her name is Betty . - If you mean the little girl upstairs , her name 's Nancy . Nancy johnson . I 'm sure she 'll be all right . No . She was in a parade . She plays in the band . She fell down . She - - She what ? Never mind . The sun 's going down . - Well , of course . Now maybe finally it 'll cool down a little . I told you , I only wanted to take a nap , not sleep all afternoon . But you spelled Uncle josh last night . He said to let you sleep . Don 't you see ? It 's Sunday evening . I 'm sorry , Doctor . But you were so exhausted , I saw no harm , and - You certainly don 't look very well right now . Where 's Mr. Adams ? - I-l don 't know . Don 't you ? He went on an errand for me . It shouldn 't have taken this long . It couldn 't have . - Well , I 'm sure he 's come to no harm . [ Sighs ] He probably just went out for a bite to eat . Well . [ Sighs ] I guess I 'll get back to work . Wait a minute . Please forgive me . I was very confused . You 've changed your clothes . You look very , very pretty . Uncle josh said that I should also take you out for a good meal . And then we can get back to work . - No , I have to find jeff . I 'm gonna need your help . Now , I know what direction he went in ... and where he was going - let 's go . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to bump you . [ Laughing ] Are you sure you 're wide awake yet ? I 'm all right . How faraway is this Patch place ? Oh , a good mile or more . - I 'm sorry . Maybe we better take a taxi . - A what ? One of those buggy things . [ Sighs ] Clinton , be careful ! Can I find you a hansom cab , Miss Henderson ? - I 'm all right . It 's just so hot here . - Yes , joe . Please . Who was that ? Who were you talking to ? Clinton ? What 's wrong with you ? Clinton ! Get help , Katherine ! [ Chuckling ] What ? - I 'll bet this is something those computers never counted on . [ Laughing ] I 've got it , jane . [ Laughing ] X. B. I 've got woods fever . [ Shushing ] It 's all right . [ Blowing Nose ] - [ Fire Roaring ] - [ Horses Neighing ] [ Gasps ] Oleary. wake up ! O ' Leary ! Mrs. Oleary , your barn 's on fire ! [ Sirens Wailing , Bells Clanging ] [ Horses Galloping ] [ Neighing ] [ Man ] " my " n , will ya ? Here . Lakeside Hospital . Fast as possible . Yes , sir . Let 's go . Come on ! Raise your head . Open your mouth , Clinton . Unclejosh . - Here . Tastes better with a little wine , son . Is he going to be all right ? Don 't worry , honey . I 'll pull him through for you . For me ? Well , I couldn 't help noticin' the way you looked at him . I think he does look a little like that ... young surgeon got himself killed at Vicksburg back when you were 75 . Unclejosh , that has nothing to do - - l know , I know . I know . [ Door Opening ] - Sorry . [ Door Closing ] - You 're sorry ! And whatever for ? For mixing you up . For mixing myself up . Please just get well . For me ? [ Softly ] Please . Don 't go away for a while . All right ? Whoa , boy . Whoa ! - All right , look . No matter how long it takes , I want you to wait here . Now , do you understand ? Yeah . - I know I 'm gonna need you soon . Will do , guvnor . Whoa ! Whoa . Whoa , baby . Woods fever ! - I 'm sorry , Mr. Adams , but we didn 't know where you were - we didn 't know what to do . - [ Muttering ] It 's all right , Clinton . Right now , what he needs most is sleep . So you better leave now . - No. l-l 'm sure that what he 'd want is a , uh - cortisone injection . - A what ? Your uncle is upstairs at the moment , right ? Go up and get him , please . - But he 's busy with one of the women patients . And he told me not to leave Dr. Earnshaw . - Hurry , nurse . There 's no time to waste . It 's perfectly obvious that Clint wasn 't able ... to tell Dr. Henderson about his lymphatic allergies . His what ? - And if you 're adding calomel and quinine ... to the antibodies already in his system - Well ! Hurry up ! Get out of here . Go ! Go , go , go ! Quick ! Clint ! Clint ! Wake up ! - What ? What ? I 've got it ! - Got it ? Got it ? Got what ? Wh-What - The blood . The answer you said you needed . Sharkeys . Where 's your bag ? Here . Here we are . For comparison . You said it might be what you needed for the answer . [ Softly ] Where is it ? Here . Set it up on this . - [ Softly ] Careful . I couldn 't get verymuch . Chased him . He fell . He was killed . I didn 't mean to . - To kill him ? Jeff , don 't you remember , you said you can 't change history ? But the cop said Sharkey was dead . [ Sighs ] Ifhe died ... he died from woods fever before you took the blood sample . I was wrong , j eff . This doesn 't mean a thing , except maybe that Henderson was wrong , too ... and Sharkey wasn 't cured at all . [ Sighs ] All right . So now what ? So now , just leave me alone , all right ? No , Clint ! The Chicago Fire is already started ! [ effi we failed . I can 't save Betty , I can 't save anybody . So what do you want to do ? Die before you 've even been born ? Come on , Clint . Get up . [ Grunts ] I 'm gonna get the rest of your clothes on . In less than two hours , this hospital is gonna be on fire . Okay - What 'd you say about a fire ? It 's all rightjust take it easy . - Where is this fire ? [ Sniffs ] I been thinkin ' I smelled smoke . You better get back to bed . Oh. my God ! That 's west of here , ain 't it ? - From here , about southwest . What are you doing ? - I want you to see this . [ Man ] Where them holding ' pens are . And me , I got 500 white-faced Herefords just a-sittin ' down there someplace . My whole life . Back in New Orleans , you 've got a hundred , or a thousand ... or maybe a million human beings ! - What can we possibly do in a matter of minutes ? That 's a question I never ask myself , Doctor . If we get back to that railroad station , every record out of Henderson 's office downstairs ... is going with us ! Here , have a pillowcase . You grab the patients ' records . Maybe computers back home could find something we couldn 't . Jeff , this whole thing has gone wrong . We 're supposed to leave from the North Side , right ? How do you know that station will even be there at the right time ? I don 't know . I gotta go find my clothes . [ Uncapping Bottle ] [ Scoffs ] Dr. Henderson ? Nurse Henderson ? Just a moment , Nancy . - Please ? The fire . Honey , the fire 's a long way off . There 's nothing to be afraid of . - It 's so bright . Well , it 's just because of the reflection from the sky . Now , you be a good girl . I 'll be back . Sir ? Dr. Henderson ? Uh , I thinkyou 'll find him up in the women 's contagious ward . I was just up there . What are you doing ? Fire 's gettin ' worse . Joe , you lookin ' for me ? It 's all right . He knows I 'm here . Sir , what is this ? I come in , find this man rifling your whole desk . Oh , no , no . I told him he could look at anything he wanted to . I certainly didn 't think he 'd take any of my papers . Doctor , I-l can explain this . It 's really quite simple . Doctor , you 'd better look at this , right now . It 's the answer to that telegram you asked me to send out this morning ... to the surgeon general . - Who ? Who ? Yes , who ? That 's a very good question . Who the devil are you , sir ? I don 't understand . If you 'd just let me see that , sir . I sent him a little thank you for sending such helpful assistants ... and here he says he 's never even heard ... of anyone named Earnshaw or Adams . There you are , stealin' all my patients ' records . Takin ' every paper I own . - Doctor , please . I asked you a question . Who are you ? Sir , if I were to answer that - If you were to answer it ? [ Scoffs ] Joe , d - T-Take that stuff away from him . Mister , maybe I don 't care who you are . After the dumb way I 've trusted you and your friend . [ Explosion ] - [ Joe ] My God ! What was that ? The first use of dynamite , I believe . Fire Marshall Williams is trying to build a firebreak . How do you know that ? - I know , Doctor , because ... I know everything that 's gonna happen tonight . In the next few minutes , the Union Bank building will be dynamited ... in an effort to stop the fire . Doctor , I desperately need your records ! I 've got to have them ! Chicago 's burning ! The whole city 'll be on fire . This hospital , too . [ Explosion ] My God ! The Union Bank , about 1 O blocks over . Yeah . Yeah , over that way . [ Grunts ] A few more seconds , another building , several blocks to the west , was dynamited . Gas pipes are rupturing . Gas pockets . Buildings exploding into flame . Since you seem to know so much ... uh , but what about me ? Am I maybe gonna catch on fire , too ? I 'm sorry , Doctor . I don 't know how it 'll happen , but ... sometime tonight , you 're going to die . [ Laughing ] That does itljust like any two-bit soothsayer . First you scare the suckers , then - Dr. Henderson - - Shut up ! Joe , he 's all yours . Tie him up and put him in a padded cell . [ Explosion ] Clint ! - Those explosions ! The fire ! Where 's Clint ? - I just got back . He 's not here . Where 'd he go ? - I don 't know . I 've got to know where he is . - I just said I don 't know . Both his clothes and his medical bag are gone . Medical bag . The lab ! Yea - The lab ? It 's this way . What would he be doing in the lab ? There you are . You should be in bed . - What are you doing ? Never mind thatjane , do you have any more of this wine ? L-I don 't know . Uh , there were only a couple of bottles left in the hospital this afternoon . I thought you checked the wine earlier . - I did . But down at the bottom of this bottle are traces of - - [ j0shua ] jane ? Yes , Unclejosh . - jane ! You all right ? - Of course I 'm all right . Dr. Henderson , I need you . Where does this wine come from ? - Now , why the devil should I tell you - [ Jeff ] Please , sir ! Please listen to him . The wine . Where does it come from ? The wine , well , I make it myself . From elderberries . Do you bottle it yourself , Doctor ? - Mm-hmm . I need more . There were only a few traces here on the bottom ... and a few more on the cork . - Traces ? Traces of what ? Take a look at this , Doctor . [ Dr. Henderson ] The light ! Where does that light come from ? It 's a tiny battery . Sodium . An electric light bulb . Here , I 'll show you something else . A centrifuge . For the sedimentation of blood and other substances . Louis Pasteur hasn 't even imagined that yet . - Oh , yeah . L-I met Pasteur . Koch , too . Doctor , never mind that . Look in this thing and tell me what you see . Turn these until the image is sharp to your eye . [ Clears Throat ] I Clint ] Huh ? Well , I don 't know . I - I have never seen anything like it before . Never . [ Chuckles ] Waving fronds of ... moving bits . Fungus ? Spores ? - Maybe a new antibacterial ... which works on woods fever . " Antibacterial ? - " Anti-infectant " , uh ... a product of fermentation , like penicillin , like - [ Chuckles ] Doctor - Doctor , I don 't have enough there yet to analyze it . I need at least one more bottle . Where 's the rest of it ? - Antiinfection , the product of fermentation ? Unclejosh has more bottles at the house . That 's way over on the North Side . The fire 's between here and there . Clinton , did that Texan take a bottle with him when he left ? Yes , he did . - Well , he 's headed for the cattle pens . That 's closer . - The sailor refused to drink the wine , and he 's dead . The Texan drank the wine , and he 's alivejeff ? Do you think we can find him ? Wait here . - [ Joe ] Take him ! - [ Jeff ] Aw , come on - Wait ! Wait , wait , wait ! Hold on . Who are you ? What do you want here , and ... where are you 290m ? - Doctor , you wouldn 't believe me if I told you . We 've gotta get that other bottle , and take it back with us . Take it back where ? Wha - Clinton ? - [ Explosion ] Jeff , we 're running out of time . - [ People Screaming ] Doctor , I told you I know everything that 's gonna happen tonight . The explosions , remember ? - Yes , you told me I was going to die . Josh - - Your watch . Your pocket watch . Someday , it 's gonna be found . I 'll pick it up , open it ... and read the inscription on the inside . Your wife must have given it to you on the last anniversary she could share with you . November 1 O , 1854 . " To my beloved ... my most beloved husband " , she said . No one - No one in the world but me ... and my wife knew . All right . All right . All right , clear the way . Let this man out ! Now , move ! Leave him alone ! The rest of you get busy . I want wagons , ambulances , anything you can find . We 're moving everybody out of here right now ! - Right away , Unclejosh . - [ Clamoring ] - Cab ! Cab ! [ Grunts ] " To my beloved husband " - [ Chuckles ] Yes , Martha , my dear . It was your last present to me . My 49th birthday . [ Scoffs ] My God , my darling , have you been gone that long ? And am I really to join you tonight ?

Get out ! Hyah ! [ Mooing ] I 'll never get my money back ! I could never face my wife again if I hadn 't got those critters out . Listen to me. jim ! What did you do with the wine bottle ? What did you do with it ? - [ Laughing ] - [ Laughing Wildly , Hooting ] [ Chattering ] [ Fire Bells Ringing ] Clint ! - Jeff . This one practically has hair growing in it . - Oh , thank God . Look , we 're gonna have to work our way around the lake shore ... to get back to that railroad station . You know something ? Her father died at Chancellorsville ... her brother at Gettysburg - then some young surgeon - and now it 's gonna be her Unclejosh . He 'll die , too . Everybody leaves her , but still she goes on believing . What are you talking about ? You have the answer to X. B. , right there . They 'll know what to do with it back home . I 'm gonna stay hereJeff . I 'm gonna learn how to paint a picture ... and I 'm gonna learn how to shoe a horse . You what ? - I can do more good hereJeff . I 've never had anybody who needs me the way she does . She 's a ghost out of the past ... and you 're nothing but a specter from the future ! No . No ! Wait , wait , wait ! Where 's-Where 's thejohnson girl ? [ Sighs ] I thought she was already out . No . No , they forgot her . She must be still inside . Uncle Josh ... let someone else go . - [ Explosion ] [ Sighs ] Thejohnson girl . - I 'll help you . [ Jeff ] Come back , Clint ! Clint , no ! We have to leave ! - l can 't . I love her . But she 's already dead ! - Let go of me ! You haven 't even been born yet ! - Let go of me ! Clint , you can 't change what 's already happened . - You don 't know what happened . It 's 105 years ago ! [ Women Screaming ] jeff , isn 't there anything we can do to help ? - No . [ Jeff ] We gotta get up there before she goes , Clint ! [ Train Whistle Blowing ] [ Beeping ] Well , feeling better ? Much better , thank you . What are you doing here ? - We came to see you . And to give you a personal letter from the White House ... congratulating you on your discovery . You mean , the cure works ? - I 'll show you . Our very first recovery . She 's going home . She just wanted to say good-bye . Come in , Betty . Hello ! - H1 ; Betty . I bet you don 't remember me , do you ? Well , not really , I guess . But I know you 're the one that saved me . No . Not me . Not just me . But thank you , anyway . Good luck , honey . Bye . - Bye . But you 're being cured , too . And the question is , when were you infected ? In the past , or the present ? Helen , where is Jeff ? - As a scientist ... doesn 't that fascinate you ? - I spoke to him this morning . He 's doing what you asked him to do . - In a way , we could say ... you had a fever for 1 O4 years - imagine ! Then , on the other hand , if your infection first occurred in the present - Dr. Cummings , I really don 't think he 's much interested in that yet . [ Chuckles ] You will be , son . You will be . Perhaps you 'd like to run some more medical experiments for us . The black plague . - I 'd what ? Clint , we desperately need someone with your qualifications . Now , wait a minute ! Well , you 've already broken so much new ground for us . Like bringing you back here to New Orleans instead of to our ranch house . Do you mean you never did that before ? Well , we had to , Clint , for the sake of speed . You didn 't even know it was gonna work , and you didn 't warn me ? You 'vejust been slapping us around in time ... like a pair of white mice in your laboratory ? [ Phone Ringing ] Hello ? Oh , yes , put him on . It 's Chicago . What happened ? Wonderful ! Yes , I 'll tell him ! Oh , we all will . Right away . Okay . Bye . [ Placing Receiver In Cradle ] That wasjeff . He found it . [ Clint ] That White House letter 's more for him than anyone else . He 'll think it was a phony . It wasn 't signed by President Grant . [ Chuckles ] Well - Where is she ? It 's nice , it was paid for by an alderman . Clarence somebody-or-other . October 9 . That same night . She did die that same night . You couldn 't have saved her , Clint . No . I guess I just fell in love with history , that 's all . [ Fire Roaring ] The end

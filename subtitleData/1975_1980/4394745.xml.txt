 ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) ( SHEEP BLEATING ) ( DOGS BARKING ) ( FOOTSTEPS ) ( GASPS ) What 's the matter ? Did I wake you up ? Oh , no . No , I ... It 's these dogs , see ? They ... They 've been circling around all the morning . - Give me the glasses . - Aye . See anything ? What is it ? Smoke . But there 's nothing over there , even there 's no people . Yeah , well , there is now . - What is it ? - Shh . There 's someone coming . Better if we stay off the road . - Let 's go this way . - Go where though ? We can 't just wander . Go where ? PAUL : Gyppos ? GREG : No , I don 't think so . PAUL : Well , it 's not somebody out for a quiet picnic . Not with two ruddy great vans like that . Anybody about ? Let 's have a look . PAUL : Warm . Why , doing themselves proud . Had a fair old scoff . And everything out of tins . Must be pretty well stocked up if they can afford to eat all this just for one meal . It 's from the hardware department at the Co-op . Nails ! Second floor , wines and spirits , food hall , fashion department and haberdashery . Way out , man . Yeah . Well , whoever they are , they 've certainly been squirreling stuff away . Here , look at this . Ciggies . - Have a few of these . - Put them back . Why ? Abby must be out of fags by now . - Have 200 on me . - I said put them back . Oh , come on . They 're not gonna miss a few packets out of this lot . Do as he says , lad . Put them back . I said put them back . Right . Huxley is my name . Bernard Huxley . - Greg Preston . - Yeah . - This is Paul . - Hi , nice to meet you . - Living local are you ? - Not far away . - Many of you ? - Enough . Good . Good . That 's very good . I 'll have to put you on my calling list . - Calling list ? - Well , I 'm planning on making a few regular trips down south . Twice a year at least . More when trade starts to build up . I 'll tell you what , why don 't you have a drink with me and then you can show me where your place is on the map , eh ? All right , good Scottish whiskey . BERNARD : Phil ! Get the stuff sorted out and loaded up , will you ? And get Norman to catalogue it . Eh ... Where is Norman ? And Laura , eh ? Norman ? Laura ? Did you see a man and a girl when you arrived ? - Not me . - Oh , never mind . Probably gone for a walk . Come on , let 's have that drink . Now , show me where your place is . Just put a mark on the map . Yeah , can I just get one thing straight , are you ... Are you trading all that stuff in those vans ? Well , I 'm not giving it away , am I ? We salvage what we can from towns and villages . - We 've been over at Colworth today . - Colworth ? We tried to get in there a month ago , you can 't get near the place . Stinking . Yeah , and dangerous . Still it 's all right with these things . Anyway , diseased or not , somebody had been in there before us . No food , only hardware . Still it 's getting like that these days . You got to be damn lucky to find a place that hasn 't been done over . Look , if you are bartering all this stuff you pick up , what are you taking in exchange ? Gold , of course . Gold ? - What use is gold ? - Well , it 's no use at the moment . You got to have vision , lad . Vision . That 's what private enterprise is built on . Things will be back to normal again some time , you 'll see . You find gold . Get everybody in your community to look for it . Because I tell you , before next winter you 're gonna need some of the things I 've got . And need them badly . Yup , but all the stuff you 've got , you didn 't buy it you just picked it up . Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . That 's part of my work . That 's what me and my lads do . We take chances and it 's not all easy . We 've had a few shoot-ups . But that 's a legitimate trading risk . Once I 've got the stuff , you see , it 's mine to sell . You don 't have to buy , I mean , nobody 's forcing you . ( EXPLOSION ) - What the hell was that ? - Oh , my lads . I get them to set up a few charges in the place that we 've been , gets a few fires going , clears out disease . Yeah , also clears out anything that you might have missed . Makes your little stock pile all the more valuable . Oh , I never thought of that . You want to check this or shall I put it in the chest ? No , get Laura to assay it , and then ... Where is she ? Laura ? - Shall I put it away ? - Yes , yes , yes . Laura your wife ? I 'll have to go look for them . Do stay and have another drink . Look , if you want me to call on you , just put your location on that map , eh ? Well , nice to have met you . All right , ta-da then . Hey ! The chest is open . There 's a note . Eh ? Anything gone ? - How many bags of coin were there ? - Twelve . - There 's 10 here now . - That thieving little ... My God , she 's run out on me . Now you wait till the lads get back from the village and then tell them to start searching . I want them both . And take it easy with Laura . If Norman gives any trouble take care of him . We 're not leaving here without Laura , right ? Let 's get out of here . ( PANTS ) Let 's go back . You can go back if you want to , I 'm not . He 'll come looking for us , you can depend on that . If he doesn 't find us in a couple of days , he 'll give up . He won 't let up , Laura . Well , then go back , I didn 't ask you to come . Couldn 't let you be on your own . I managed on my own for two months . I didn 't need anybody then and I don 't need anybody now . Oh , I 'm sorry , Norman . Of course I want you with me . Listen , I know you 're scared of him , I am . But believe me , if we can just lay low for a couple of days it 'll be all right . ( SIGHS ) He 's almost cleaned out this area anyway . No . He 'll keep after us all right . The gold coin ! But I deliberately only brought what I had when I met him . I , uh ... I just didn 't think it out , but I knew if we 're on our own we 'd need something . Well , he won 't give up now , will he ? We 've got to get away . Find somewhere safe . We were just beginning to worry about you . We 've got some visitors . This is Laura and this is Norman . - Kids all right ? - Hmm . I 've settled them down . It 's Lizzie . She 's been frightened of the dark ever since Wendy died . No , we can 't give her a lamp , it 's far too dangerous . If only we had some candles , then we could make some night lights . What about those people Laura was with ? - What about them ? - Well , they might have some . Well , what happens when we run out of those ? What do we give the kids then ? Well , it would keep ' em going for the minute . - She 's all fixed up . - ABBY : And where have you put her ? She 's in with me . I think it 's the best . You know , I believe the baby is due any moment now . But she doesn 't know or can 't be sure . Poor girl 's lost all track of time . ABBY : What about that man ? What 's his name ? Norman ? Oh , we put him in with Paul until we can think of something else . Don 't they want to be together ? Oh , no , he 's not the father . She keeps talking about a man called Huxley . Oh ! Oh , that won 't be much help , my dear . - I know . - ( CHUCKLES ) And written by a man . I wonder when he had a baby ? Well , don 't worry , Abby . She 'll be all right . - Look , there 's nothing like experience . - Mine 's pretty useless . Hardly remember it . I was very spoilt , before , during and after . Well , I wasn 't and I had four . So , don 't worry , she 'll be all right . She 's a nice healthy strong girl . What are we going to do about clothes ? I suppose what we really need is warmth . Perhaps we could unpick a sweater or a pullover . That or a spare one . It will need a cot , too , won 't it ? Greg , did those people you met have any wool , any skeins of wool ? No , how many rings have you got ? Perhaps , someone 's got a spare bar of gold bullion . Well , the baby is welcome to mine . Yeah , well , the woman is not staying here . I 'm sorry , but we can 't let her stay . - ABBY : And why not ? - Because it is too dangerous . Dangerous ? What are you talking about ? We 've met this bloke of hers , Huxley , he 's a nutcase . - You mean he 's mad ? - Bananas . - ABBY : Why ? - You kidding ? Gold . So that makes him stupid , it doesn 't make him mad . That 's the least of it . And she did this before he killed the bloke she ran away with . - Well , we can 't turn her out . - Of course we can 't . All right , well , you decide which of us gets killed . Oh , Greg , don 't be so melodramatic . Look , has she told any of you why she 's running away ? No . Well , Huxley won 't let her have the child . So how does he intend to stop her ? Abby , he won 't let her keep it . Says he 's not going to be burdened with it . Burdened with it ? Who does he think is going to feed him in his old days ? That 's besides the ... What about Norman ? I mean , what do you think Huxley thinks about him ? He 's not only stolen his woman , he 's got two bags of his precious gold coins . Gold coins ! How many gold coins is a baby worth ? I won 't turn them out , Greg . We 'll keep them here , hide them until Huxley stops looking but I won 't turn them out . I 'll not have that on my conscience , will you ? Well , you got a straightforward choice , your conscience or your survival . - Are you going to have a baby ? - Yes . - Like mine ? - No , not quite like yours . - Boy or girl ? - I don 't know that yet . We 'll have to wait until it 's born . I think it might be a boy , kicks like a boy anyway . Do you want to feel it kicking ? Yes , please . You may have to wait a minute . - There , did you feel it ? - Yes . - May I have a feel ? - Hand . - There . - Yes . Does it hurt ? ( CHUCKLES ) No , of course not . There 's a car coming . Looks like a Range Rover . GREG : That 's them . Norman , it 's Huxley coming . I want you to get down inside the cellar and take Laura with you . And , Paul , everyone , back to work . I want everything as normal as possible . - Normal . - All right , give me a hand . There . Now , I 'm going to lock you both in here and do not make any sound , do you understand ? - No matter what happens . - Yes . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . - Oh , Emma , for God 's sake . - No for her sake . You don 't know how long she 's going to be down there . Oh , all right . Norman ! - There . - NORMAN : Right . Now , we forget they were ever here . - Good morning . - ABBY : Hello . Uh , we 're looking for a man and a girl , have you seen them ? - We haven 't seen anyone for weeks . - Oh . Well , we met a couple of your people yesterday . Oh , you must be the traders . Yes , they told me about you . Uh , look , would you like to come in and have some fresh milk and some bread ? We did some baking yesterday . Thank you very much . It 's very kind of you . - Thank you . - Where have you come from ? I 've got a base just outside North Hampton . It 's an old castle . Makes a good warehouse . How many of you are there ? Well , there 's eight left out there taking care of things , and six ... No , four with me now . Would you all like to stay the night ? We haven 't had much news lately . It 'd be nice to know what 's happening in the rest of the country . We can give you all a meal . No , thank you . As soon as I find my wife we 'll be pulling out . Pity . Well , would you like a fresh loaf ? As I said we did bake yesterday . Oh , Thank you . We haven 't had bread for a long time . I 'll ... I 'll pay you for it . There 's no need . I 'll get it . - It 's a big place . - Yes . Oh , thank you . How many of you ? Enough . We go this way . - Who 're you ? - Phil 's my name . - What 's yours ? - John . My name 's Lizzie . - What 's your dolly 's name ? - Rosie . That 's a nice name . - Is she your baby ? - No . Well ... I felt the baby kicking . ( SCOFFS ) You mean Rosie ? No , of course not , silly . The one in the lady 's tummy . Well , thank you very much . It 's been very kind of you . - ABBY : Not at all . Bye-bye . - Goodbye now . - Bye-bye now , children . - LIZZIE : Bye . JOHN : Bye . Yes . Well , come on , kids . - Well ? - They had a good snoop around . - Curious about how many of us there are . - Did you tell him ? Of course not . - There are five of them . - No , he said there were five of them . - GREG : Everything all right ? - Sure . I thought I heard a car about half an hour ago . I could be wrong . Yeah , well , I 'll get Arthur to give you a rest . No way , I 'm fine . I 'll send someone out with something hot to drink . That 'd be good . ( GROANS ) - Oh , wouldn 't you be better off in bed ? - Not yet . It 's more comfortable in here and warmer . - You thought about names yet ? - He won 't let me keep it . Oh , he will have no say in the matter . You are with us now . We will look after you and the baby . So please just stop worrying . It was one of the conditions when he took me in . He said he 's feed me , look after me and I 'd be his wife . We have to get rid of the baby , find someone to look after it in one of the new settlements . - Well , there 's no need for that now . - I agreed . I was so lonely . After the Death I was on my own for six weeks . Maybe more . I thought I was the only one left . It was terrible . I think I must have been half out of my mind when Huxley found me . Anyway , he looked after me . After three months , he said he wouldn 't be the father to another man 's child . I had a choice he said . I could stay with him , we 'd have to get rid of the baby . I didn 't want to be on my own again . I couldn 't . So I agreed , I stayed . You didn 't have much choice , did you ? ( DOOR OPENING ) BERNARD : ( SHUSHING ) Quiet . Listen . Oh , my eyes . What I really need are new glasses . There 's no chance of that now I 'm afraid . I know . Well , what about you ? Are you keeping up your exercises ? - Oh , yes . - Fine . You see relaxation , that 's the thing . It 's only when you get nervous or frightened that things can get a bit more difficult . I 'm not frightened , no . First , I thought I 'd be terrified , but now it 's close I 'm getting quite calm . ( DOOR OPENING ) ( EMMA GASPS ) - Right , get your things . - She 's staying here . - You heard me . - She 's not coming with you . - Now , get out of here . - Now , look . I got three men outside and we 're all armed . Now , I don 't want any more trouble than what 's is necessary . I 'm just taking what belongs to me . - Now , get the coins and we 'll go . - Norman 's got them . Look , if it 's the money you want I 'll get it for you . Then will you go ? - I 'm taking my wife . - I 'm not your wife . - Right , hold her . - Now tell me where the man is . - I ... - Don 't raise any commotion . Just tell me where he is , eh ? Come on , now , move , move . Move ! - Now , tell me where he is . - GREG : Stay right where you are . Now , let them go . I said let them go . I 'm only taking what I came for . You are in no position to take anything , Mr Huxley . You 're coming back to me , Laura ! I 'll take the rifle . Now , move . Norman . Now , that settles the only claim you have on us . You take nothing else from here . Now , get out . I 'll be back . You haven 't heard the last of him . - Laura , you mustn 't talk like that . - Oh , you don 't know him . - And we don 't want to . - He 'll try again , that 's for sure . - Well , let him . - If someone got hurt ? - Suppose someone got killed ? - Laura , do you want this baby ? - Yes . - Then what 's the alternative ? Now , don 't worry , you 'll see , he 's not as tough as all that . Well , he doesn 't have to be tough . - He 's vain , that makes him dangerous . - Yes . He 's got his precious gold back , hasn 't he ? Come on , darling , it 's time that we got you to bed . Do you think he will try again ? Well , I would . Wouldn 't you ? LIZZIE : Quick , quick , it 's Mr Russell . - He 's over there , tied up . - You two , get inside the house . ( GRUNTING ) ( EXHALES ) I couldn 't do anything , there were three of them . - Was it Huxley ? - Yeah . - But you 're not hurt ? - No , he 's burnt the stack . Yeah , I saw that . He said that was only the beginning . They 've given us until 10 : 00 tomorrow morning . - And that 's all the time he 's giving us . - Do the others know ? - No , not yet . - Then they mustn 't , we must keep quiet . Abby , this is a declaration of war . We just can 't ignore it . - Then it might be bluff ? - No , they weren 't bluffing . - Well , how many of them are there ? - Five . - Well , there are 10 of us . - Yeah , not counting the children . Look , if he makes a straightforward attack , that 's fine . We can hold him off . But that 's not going to be his style or tactic . He 's going to keep chipping away at us , choosing his target and picking his time . Now , that sort of thing we just can 't defend against . What he did today was in spite of having Vic up on the roof . Well , then we must stay in groups . Abby , anyone out in the open 's at risk . The sort of guns they 've got , they can pick us off from half a mile away . Do you mean ... You think they 'd try to kill us ? Well , they don 't have to kill , I mean , what would you do about a shattered kneecap ? I knew they 'd try to terrorise us . Try to damage our crops but I never thought that they ... - GREG : She 's got to go . - No . All right . Well , you come up with an idea . - There is an alternative . - What ? Well , we take the initiative . We take the fight to them . - No . - Abby , we 've got - till 10 : 00 tomorrow morning . - Would you tell her she can 't stay ? Look , I know we got precious little here but I 'm not prepared to risk any part of it to keep her . And I don 't think you should ask any of the others to take that risk . - Arthur ? - I agree with Greg . But , Arthur , it 's a woman and her baby ! I just don 't think you 're being realistic . - What do you mean ? - Well , Huxley didn 't say he was going to kill the child , he told Laura he 'd leave it with a community . - Well ? - Well , he can leave it with us . She wouldn 't do that , she 'd rather be dead . - Yeah , well , I 'd rather not . - Greg , we can 't ask her to leave . For God 's sake , she came to us for help . That woman and her child are the future . Yeah , but what about our children ? What about our future ? Oh , I don 't know . I don 't know . All I do know is that I won 't ask her to leave . - All right . But if you won 't ... - And you won 't , Greg . You won 't . ( SOFTLY ) Norman . - Norman . - NORMAN : Who is it ? It 's Laura . - What 's the matter ? - I 'm going . - What ? - I 'm going back . - You can 't . - I must . - Come with me , help me . - Well , he 'll kill me . No , he won 't . Listen , if we go back he 'll leave these people here . Please . - It 'll be light in half an hour . - I 'll get dressed . Shh , don 't wake Paul . Price . Paul 's gonna look after the sheep this morning . You can go to sleep somewhere else . Like while you 're hoeing the potatoes . Oh , no , no , where 's the sense of that to you ? With this leg playing me up and it 's more work for Paul , see ? - And the sheep know me . They do . - Yeah , well , I know you , too . Spuds . Greg . Greg , she 's gone . Laura 's gone . - Yeah , I know . - You told her ? - No , I didn 't . - You told her ! I told her Huxley 's ultimatum . She went of her own accord . Oh ! Of her own accord . - I 'm going up there . - Okay . ( DOGS HOWLING ) - They 're still around ? - Yeah . Do you reckon if they interbreed they 'll turn into a kind of real wild dog ? I suppose there 'll be a sort of mongrel breed establish itself . Then the whole process of natural selection will start all over again . I was reading up about them last night . Well , wolves , if one of them in a pack gets sick or wounded , the rest just turn on him . ( CHUCKLES ) Tear him to pieces . Another bit of real useless information . See ya . ( TWIGS BREAKING ) ( GASPS ) - Thank God . - Why , what 's happened ? It 's Laura . I think she 's started the baby . - Where is she ? - Down there , there 's an old farm road . I was coming back for help . Well , I 'll look after her . You go back to the house and get Abby . - All right . - And tell her to bring a Land Rover . Right . ( PANTING ) How is it ? I 'm so sorry . I hope ... Oh , don 't worry . It 's going to be all right . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) It 's all right . It 's not as bad as it looks and perfectly natural . Do you know anything about it ? ( CHUCKLES ) It 's that stuff out of the old movies about hot water and plenty of it . ( SOBBING ) I 'm sorry . I did try and get back . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . Right , lads , come on . - Charmian ! Jenny ! Come on . - JENNY : Coming . Emma , quickly . Come on , kids , out of the way . - LIZZIE : We 're waiting for the baby . - Well , you won 't have to wait long . See , I told you . GREG : ( CHUCKLING ) Well , there it goes . - What ? - Hot water and plenty of it . Look , Norman , would you take this up to Vic on the roof ? - Sure . - Yeah , and then when you 've done that , could you and give Paul a hand to get the sheep and the rest of the stock inside ? And get Price , he 's somewhere by the potatoes . - Right . Yes . - And take a gun with you . - Look , I can get Price . - No , let 's just get rid that . Then we go and get water as much as we can , all right ? Shall we have a game of cards ? - No . Let 's go and see . - See what ? - The baby , silly . - But there isn 't one , not yet . But there is going to be . We could go and have a look . No , it wouldn 't be allowed . Grown-ups are funny . ( TUTTING ) - Hope it 's a girl . - Well , I don 't . Girls cry all the time . - No , they don 't . - Yes , they do . - No , they don 't . - They do ! - They don 't . - Do . - They don 't . - Do . - Don 't . - Do . ( RUSTLING ) ( BLEATING ) ( GROANS ) Get up . ( BABY CRYING ) - What 's that ? - That 's the baby . - Why is it crying ? - ' Cause it 's a girl . - I bet it isn 't . - Yes , it is . - No , it isn 't . - It is . - It isn 't . - It is . - Where you going ? - I want to see . - You can 't . - I 'm going to . - It isn 't a girl , is it ? - Yes , but how did you know ? It 's a lovely little girl . JOHN : I told you . ( GUNSHOT ) ( GUNSHOT CONTINUES ) No ! No ! No ! No ! ( PANTING ) - Oh , thanks . How 's Emma ? - Everything is being looked after . We 're not going to be able to keep this up , you know . There 's no choice . A day and a night watch . Well , there 's not much he can do during the daylight , at least that now we 've got the stock inside . We can all rest up during the day . - He 'll ruin our crops . - If he tries that , we 'll open up on him . - I 'm sorry , Greg . - What for ? Got a choice most of the time , this time we haven 't . Anyway , how is she ? - She 's fine . - And the baby ? Worth it I think . ( CHUCKLES ) That 's why the female of the species is more ferocious than the male . ( EXPLOSION ) GREG : Stay under cover , everyone ! BERNARD : In there , you hear me ? We can hear ! That 's the last warning you get . We have explosives and we 'll use them . Do you hear me ? We 'll use them . Now , you think about it . I 'll wait until morning . You think about it . ( CAR DOOR CLOSING ) ( ENGINE STARTING ) Abby , get everyone together . We 're gonna have a council of war . Now , I don 't think he can do us much harm in daylight I don 't think he can get close enough to lay his explosives . Could he have set charges all ready ? That 's what he means , tonight ? GREG : That is unlikely . I think one of us would have heard something . Not me , not on my side . I wouldn 't have heard because of the river . Well , I don 't think he 'll bother to attack the walls . Well , I think he 's more likely to lob stuff through the windows and then try and burn us out . - Tomorrow night ? - Well , I think so . He couldn 't be mad enough to do that . Oh , yes , he could . Why , he can blow the hell out of us , man . We could build watch fires . No , I think that could prove more dangerous for us than for them . There is a simple choice . We either give him Laura or we take whatever he throws at us . - There is an another alternative . - And what 's that ? Well , we 've got the bus and the Land Rover , we could just get in them and go . All right . Well , who wants to go ? Well , now , see , I 've always been a bit of a wanderer ... You 're not wandering anywhere ! Now , the others , do any of you want to go ? Well , that takes care of that . Now , there is another choice . Now , there are five of us and there are five of them . Now , we can either sit here and wait for them to hit us , or we can take the initiative and hit them first . - Hit them first . - ARTHUR : Yes . - GREG : Norman ? - Yes . But there are more than five of us . Well , I 'm just counting the able-bodied men . - But you can count me and Jenny . - JENNY : Yes . - No . - Oh , come on . - We can look after ourselves . - I know you can look after yourselves but who is going to look after the children ? He 's right , my dear . I ... I couldn 't cope alone . Well ... Well , now , you don 't want to worry . I can look after them . They 'll be all right with me , see ? - I 'll see to that . - I 'll see to you in a minute , Price . ( BABY CRYING ) There . There , she wants her feed . You know , I still think we stand a better chance if there are more of us . It may not come to shooting , they may back down . Well , there 'll be no need for shooting . We take them by surprise . Get their ammunition and explosive and just draw their sting . Now , the five of us should get ready . We 'll go up around the long wood , make a wide circle behind them . Then , we 'll just sit and wait . - Is Arthur all right ? - Yes . He 'll signal when they 're all between the pantechnicons . Fine . - We could pick them all up from here . - Yeah . Well , there 's to be no shooting . Not unless they start it . The aim is just to disarm them and move them on . That 's all . And how long will it be before they get more ... I said there 's to be no shooting . ( GROANS ) ( GUNSHOTS ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) TOM : Help me ! Help me ! ( TOM GROANING ) Help me ! It 's Price . Come on . Where the hell are the others ? And why don 't they do something ? For Pete 's sake , let 's get out of here . - We can 't leave without Price . - We can 't help him . ( CAR APPROACHING ) Keep under cover , but don 't shoot . It 's Abby . Nobody shoot . I want to go now . All right . One of your men is hurt . We 'll look after him . She made me bring her . All right , we 're moving . Hold it ! Price is dead . We 'll take all your explosive and ammunition . What for ? Well , in that case , we 'll just borrow some spades . Help yourself . He did worse things . Come on . ( INAUDIBLE )

 ( PEOPLE ARGUING ) GREG : Who the hell do you think you 're talking to ? - Stop it ! Please , stop it ! - I do just about everything that makes this place tick , and don 't any of you forget that . Please , please . Come to order , please . ( JENNY LAUGHING ) - And what 's so funny ? - Don 't tempt me . Since when have you been appointed chairman of the board ? Since you started to make a fool of yourself . - Now , look ... - Oh , stop it , do . - Yeah . Put a sock in it . - Like hell ! I 'm accused of making some sort of duff deal ... You haven 't been accused of anything just because you 're feeling rather ... Insinuations , then , but you just expect me to sit here listening to your ... Oh , don 't be so touchy ! GREG : Well , that 's bloody marvellous coming from you . You 've done nothing but sulk for the past six weeks . Now , stop this . Stop it . Come on , pull yourselves together . You 're behaving like a lot of children . Look , I accepted what they gave me in good faith . - Well , of course you did . - While they grabbed our petrol , you might at least have looked at what they gave you . Now , listen , Greg . I don 't believe Greg 's to blame . Look , I 'll go back . I 'll take everything back to Little Barton and see if they 'll just swap it for once . Shut up ! Right . Now , we traded 200 gallons of petrol for things that we needed , including some seed , which turned out to be sour . That doesn 't make Greg a fool . Neither does it make the people at Little Barton cheats . The fact remains , we got their no-good seed and they got our petrol . Well , then we go back to them . Well , I just wish I shared your faith in human nature . I wish you did to . Why should we assume they want to do us down ? - Why shouldn 't we talk to them ? - It 's been tried , Arthur . And that 's a good reason for not trying again ? We have mutual needs . Look , we all have mutual needs to protect ourselves . It 's the same for the people at Little Barton . It 's the same for every other settlement . It 's the same for us . We 're all out for whatever is best for ourselves . Now , you don 't barter unless you 've got more of something than you need . A surplus . And we just haven 't got one . Not yet . ( SIGHS ) Not for a long , long time , Arthur . - I 'm going to bed . - Hang about . - What about our spuds ? - They 've got spuds at Barton . Everyone 's got spuds . - Our wheat crop , then . - What wheat crop ? We haven 't got it in yet . And what about the weather ? We just need another summer like last year and we 've got nothing at all . We can 't go bartering on just ... ( DOOR CLOSING ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) ( SIGHING ) ( LOCK CLICKING ) ( DOOR CLOSING ) Abby , listen . Did you decide on what you want to do about those sheep ? I rather think they could do with some new grass . Oh , then shift them . Yes . But it 's not as quite as straightforward as that . If we use the bottom meadow , it 's a bit far from the house , there are still those dogs about . Oh , for heaven 's sake , Arthur . Just do what you want . The pigswill wasn 't taken out last night . It stinks . Think somebody could have thought of it . Well , I can 't do everything . I mean , just put it out last thing at night . ( BLOWING ) ( COUGHS ) ( EXCLAIMS SOFTLY ) ( GROANING ) ( CLICKS TONGUE ) ( SIGHS ) ( GREG SIGHING ) One doesn 't say " hello " in this house ? ( EMMA SNIFFLING ) Really . The children could light the stove . I have enough to do as it is . Plus the baby and her poor sick mother upstairs . And trying to feed all of you , as well . The children should light it . I shouldn 't have to do it . ( EMMA SIGHS ) Look , in the village , where we went for holidays when I was small girl , it was always the job of the children ... Children are too young to be playing with fires . What 's on the agenda for this morning ? I don 't know . Whatever you want . I thought I might do the greenhouse , if that 's all right . If that 's what you want , then do it . Well , couldn 't you both do that outside ? - Sure . - I told him . I said , " Do you have to clean rabbits in the kitchen ? Outside is the place for it . " Could we do something about keeping the pigswill another place ? Wasn 't put out last night . ( DOOR THUDS ) Abby . Something wrong with one of the cows . It 's hobbling rather badly . - Then ask Arthur to have a look at it . - I couldn 't find him . Oh , I 'll see to it . Ah , there you are . You got a new job from now on . I was just saying to Greg . that children ... Abby , Vic said to come quick . Oh , all right . ( ABBY SIGHS ) Oh , no ! - All of them ? - VIC : Yes . - Fox ? - Oh , I suppose so . Say a fox will do that . Kill everything and then just take off what it needs . ( VIC SIGHS ) And how 'd it get in ? Main gate was open . John , weren 't you supposed to be in charge of the chickens this week ? But I didn 't leave it open . It wasn 't me . ( ABBY SIGHS ) JOHN : I didn 't leave it open . Honest . It wasn 't my fault . Come on . Anything I can do ? Is it one thing in particular , or you 're just generally feeling fed up ? Oh , I don 't know , Jen . It 's all sorts of things . Why can 't they do things on their own ? Why do they have to keep running to me all the time ? I don 't think any of us mean to burden you . But right from the start , it was you who organised things . If it hadn 't been for you , we wouldn 't have stayed together . So , it 's natural that we come to you for help . Yes , but who do I go to ? Who listens to my worries ? Or aren 't I allowed to have any ? I 'm listening . ( ABBY CHUCKLES SOFTLY ) Yes , I know . I suppose , I just want a good chance to moan , really . Well , go ahead , then . Have a good shout at me , if it will make you feel any better . ( CHUCKLES ) It wouldn 't . JENNY : It 's Peter , isn 't it ? Partly . Why don 't you have another go at looking for him ? We 've got the petrol . And rob you all for what Greg calls " a compulsion " ? Oh , we can do without it . It 's thanks to you that we 've got something here that 's working . Why don 't you ? - No . - Give me one good reason why not ? You think we can 't do without you ? - That 's rubbish , Jenny . - No , it isn 't . Or you wouldn 't get into such a tizz . Go on . Be a devil . Try us . ( LAUGHS ) Thanks , Jen , but ... But , what ? You don 't run this place , you know . You may be the queen of the castle , but it 's Greg who actually runs it . - Yes , I know . - Well , there you are , then . - I 'll think about it . - Hard . It 's all right for you , Jen , you ... What ? Well , you 've got Greg . Yes . And you 're pregnant , aren 't you ? How did you know ? Well , it 's not something you can hide . However hard you try . Thanks anyway for trying . - There was someone , wasn 't there ? - What ? Someone you could have taken your troubles to . ( BELL TOLLING ) ( SIGHS ) What now ? - What is it ? - Look over there . Why are you ringing the bell ? What 's going on ? - Look . - Strange people . Right . Wait here , everybody . GREG : Do you have sickness amongst you ? MAN : We have a girl who 's ill . We don 't know what it is . GREG : I 'm sorry , but we can 't take risks . You ask your people not to come any closer to the house . Understood . See to it , Richard . May I come forward ? Yes . All right . - Well , what 's happening ? - I don 't know . They just suddenly appeared . I better go and see . Abby , let Greg deal with it . - Where you from ? - Garston . - Where 's that ? - It 's about 50 miles north of here . - And where you all going to ? - Oh , nowhere special . We 're looking for a place . - What were you doing in Garston ? - We had a farm . We were managing quite nicely . GREG : Then why did you bother to leave it ? We had no option . We were driven off . - By whom ? - Oh , a group near us . Maybe 30 or 40 of them . It was all right at first . And then they banded themselves up into what they call themselves militia . Said they were establishing local government . They 'd give us protection , they said . God knows what against . Anyway , in return , we were to supply them with a percentage of our stores and crops . But I turned them down and said no . We didn 't have enough to spare . None of us have . - And so they drove you off . - MAN : Simple as that . Oh , they clothed it in legal sounding phrases , but we 'd no means of defending ourselves against them . So , we left . ( SIGHS ) Hope to God they don 't come this way . Well , they 're not far from here . And once they start running short , they 'll widen their range , and I can tell you , they 're a rough lot . Yes . Well , we 've dealt with people like that before . Aye . Well , we might have stood a better chance if we 'd kept in with other people . Well , is there anything that we can do to help you ? We might be able to spare you a little food or something . No , thanks . No , we can manage . We 'll get by . No , it 's the girl . She 's very sick . She was ill when we found her , and the journey 's made her worse . She needs rest and far more attention than we can give her . Yes , but ... ( CHUCKLES ) But if she 's got something that 's infectious or contagious , well , that 's asking a lot . I know . But if she stays with us on the road , she might die . Well , you stay here for a while . Now you understand , this involves other people , so I can 't give you an answer about it straight away . Of course . - We can wait . - Right . Right , everybody . We 're waiting . We might as well eat . Abby ? ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Abby , you there ? ( DOOR OPENING ) ( FOOTSTEPS PATTERING ) EMMA : Abby ? Are you upstairs ? MAN : Abby ? No . She wasn 't there . I don 't know where she could be . Uh , did you try outside ? I 've been all around . ( GREG SIGHS ) - She 's not in her room . - Well , she can 't just have vanished . - Where the hell is Abby ? - I don 't know . Oh , this can 't wait . Look , it 's pretty straightforward . Those people out there want to leave a sick girl with us . Now the question is , if she 's got something that 's infectious or contagious , well , can we afford the risk of letting her stay here ? Well ? - So , we 're agreed ? - ARTHUR : Mmm-hmm . - Yes . - Yes . That 's it , then . All right . You don 't need to say it . GREG : But , please understand . It 's not that we don 't sympathise with you . But we have children here with us . MAN : We 're going on . I 'm sorry but it was a decision we all made . PAUL : That 's not the point though , is it ? I agree with Greg . We 've talked about defence , but we 've never done anything about it . Yeah . But what do you mean ? Barbed wire ? Lookouts ? Armed guards ? Well , I think it would be stupid if we didn 't learn a lesson from those people today . Well , like our chickens this morning . Going along quite nicely . Till someone forgets to close the gate . Then ... The fox gets the lot of them . You going in for parables now , Paul ? ( CHUCKLING ) Well , I thought he made rather a neat point . Only how do we stop being chickens ? Well , look , it 's obvious that we can put up no more than a token defence against any sort of sizeable force against us . And I think that goes for any other group that 's setup in this area . - Yeah . - Well , as far as I can see , there 's only one answer to that . And that is that we all join forces , every little group , into some sort of alliance or federation . And in that way , we 'll know that if , if one of us in trouble , then at least some of the others will come to our help . - Hmm . - That makes sense to me . Then why don 't we go and meet the other groups ? Why don 't we ask them all to send a representative here ? Then we can thrash the whole thing out . ( ALL AGREEING ) Let 's stop talking about it and do it . Let 's send out messages first thing tomorrow . Right . If we get an agreement , and there 's no reason why we shouldn 't , then any of your foxes thinking of looking us over , ( CHUCKLES ) well , they 'll think twice before they make a move . What do you think , Abby ? Yes . Yes , I think you 're right . Splendid . Well , let 's draft a letter and get copies delivered . We 'll set the date of the meeting at , what , two days from now ? Right . There 's no point delaying . I 'll get some paper . Maps . Abby , are you feeling any better ? ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) I 'll get over it . It 's a step in the right direction , isn 't it ? Yes . No one can live in isolation . Though I 'd like to think it would go beyond forming an army . Well , it doesn 't have to stop there . It can lead to almost anything . At least , it 's good to know that if we 're in trouble , someone 's going to come and help us . - Yes . - Abby ? You better come . I think all of you better come . Please . GREG : I might have guessed he 'd do this . ABBY : She 's burning . EMMA : Poor child . ABBY : That 's all right . It 's all right . GREG : It 's not all right . She can 't stay ! Oh , can 't she ? Two minutes ago , you were talking about helping one another . So we can have people to call on when we were in trouble . ( SCOFFS ) Get out of my way ! - Come on . Let 's get her inside . - I 'll prepare the bed . Okay . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) - ABBY : Steady . - Abby . - Abby ! - ABBY : Not now ! Yes , now ! You talk to me like that again and I 'll ... You 'll what ? - Are you out of your mind ? - Probably . Well , what happens when she infects us ? - We 'll have to find out , won 't we ? - Does the same go for the children ? Do we have to watch them suffering , or watch them die ? You sanctimonious pig ! You think you 're the only one with feelings . What would I do ? Leave her out here to die ? That 's exactly what we do . You got to think of everyone . All of us . Not just one person . I 'm not saying it 's easy , but at least it 's survival . If you can even think of leaving her out here , you 're not fit to survive . - Well , that 's all talk , just ... - I mean it ! Well , I mean it to . Be realistic ! Just put her in an outhouse , make her comfortable and leave her . All right ! I 'll be realistic . It 's too bloody late ! I 've already been in contact with her . So has Emma and so has Charmian . And now , so have you ! ( MOANING SOFTLY ) - Morning . - Morning . - She 's still sleeping ? - Yes . - Brought you some hot milk . - JENNY : Oh , thank you . I 'll take over for a bit . You get some rest . - How 's she been ? - Well , she 's still very feverish . Wish we had somebody who knew a bit about medicine . It 's not enough just to know it 's not the plague . I spent half the night going through the Home Doctor . But it 's hard to isolate the symptoms . I mean , she could have any one of fifty things wrong with her . Anyway , that 's what scares me the most . Being sick . I can cope with almost anything else . But to be ill without any kind of medical help , - that scares me . - Hmm . You look all in . Go on , you get to bed . Take your milk with you . - Is Abby down yet ? - No , but the others are . Oh . I 'll go and tell her everything 's all right . CHARMIAN : Okay . Abby ? GREG : I think the best thing would be to start with these two and then you can circle back here and take in all the other settlements on the way . Hmm . Good idea . You 'll never do it all in a day . Not on a bike . Not even if it is the longest day of the year . Oh , well , if I can 't , then , I 'll bed down for the night here and do the other two on the way back first thing in the morning . It depends on how much sales chat you 're in for . Selling was my business . I shan 't have any trouble . GREG : Well , you might with the lot at Waterhouse . They were having their own little private war when we were last there . Look , try and find a chap called Garland , Jimmy Garland . - Garland . - Mmm-hmm . Don 't worry . I 'll convince him . I made up enough food to see you through . And try to have something hot if you can , please . There 's some decent soup in this jar . ARTHUR : Thanks , Emma . Well , that will do me nicely . Abby ' s gone . - What do you mean ? - Just that . She wants to be on her own for a bit . ( SIGHS ) ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) Come on . Why are you always so slow , you two ? I 'm not slow . I 've finished already . - John hasn 't . - I haven 't got such a big mouth . No , no , no , no . Don 't be rude . I wasn 't being rude . I haven 't got such a big mouth . And in any case , I sometimes use it for talking . - ( LAUGHS ) Sometimes ? - I like talking . I like talking more than I like eating . Then you know what will happen to you , don 't you ? You will never grow bigger than you are now . But your tongue will grow . It will grow and grow till it 's as long as this . I don 't believe you , 'cause Abby says talking is good for you while you 're eating . It 's good for grownups , but not for you . Where is Abby ? ( SIGHING ) She 's gone for some peace and quiet . Aunt Emma , we don 't make a lot of noise . ( LAUGHING ) Come on , finish your lunch . ( EMMA SIGHS ) GARLAND : Abby ? Abby ? Abby ? Abby ? Abby Grant ? Abby ? Here ! Here I am ! - GARLAND : Abby . - Hello . You don 't look very surprised to see me . I was looking for you . You were easier to find than I thought . Hey ! What 's the matter ? Nothing . I 'm just a bit tired , that 's all . Well , I 'm not surprised . One of my men saw you couple of miles back , fast asleep . Yes , I 've been walking since 6 : 00 this morning . And I am taking you home . Get up on Jasper . ( GARLAND LAUGHING ) ( DOOR OPENING ) Any better ? EMMA : She 's a lot calmer . I think the fever 's passing . You know , a bit later , we ought to try and get her to eat something . That poor child is nothing but skin and bone . - She 's a much better colour now , though . - Hmm . ( EMMA EXCLAIMS ) Would you be so kind and sit with her for a bit ? - CHARMIAN : Hmm . - I have to get the meal started . CHARMIAN : Of course . I got everything ready . Oh , I should keep out of Greg 's way , if I were you . - Why ? - Well , he 's like a bear with a sore head . - Where is he ? - He 's cutting logs . There was no wood for the stove . So , there 's a big row about it and he went off in a huff , muttering , " If you want something done , " etcetera , etcetera . Oh , it 's such a pity all this should happen now . Just when things were getting a bit easier . ( EMMA CLICKS TONGUE ) - Here we are . - Thanks . GARLAND : Welcome . Right . I 'll see to Jasper . You go on in . ( ABBY SIGHS ) I 'll rub him down later . Is this yours ? Yes , belonged to my assistant . ( CHUCKLES ) Remember this ? ( LAUGHS ) Your cave . Well , the circumstances may be different but the brandy 's the same , guaranteed not to upset even the emptier stomach . How long since you 've had something to eat ? Last night . ( CHUCKLES ) You need looking after . I 'll fix us something . What 'd you fancy ? There 's rabbit . I expect you 're rather fed up with that . Venison , but it 's a bit high . What I can offer you is my speciality , oxtail with haricot beans . ( CHUKLES ) Oh , that sounds delicious . What chance is there 's some hot water ? Pretty good . A bit limited though if you 're thinking of a bath . - No , just a bowlful . - Easy . Easier than the cave ? Much . You know , you 're not being really fair . How do you mean ? Well , I 've told you about everything that 's happened to me but you 've told me nothing about yourself . Want to know the reason ? Of course . I 'm more interested in you . ( CHUCKLES ) Well , what about the cave ? What brought you here ? My little war came to an end . Oh , you sound disappointed . Oh , no . No , there 's more for me to do now that Knox is gone . Well , what happened ? He died . Oh . No , I didn 't kill him . He was out on one of his hunting trips after me and he broke his neck , and it wasn 't long after that before the rest of them came to me for help . So you 've got what you 've always wanted ? Yes , most of it . Well , why are you here and not at the house ? There are times when I need to be alone . Yes . I come here to think , read a bit , ( SIGHS ) just to be alone . I 'll get you that water . ( GRUNTS ) ( EXCLAIMS IN PAIN ) You all right ? Sarah used this room . There 's a change of clothes over there if you feel like . Don 't worry . They 'll manage without you . Don 't go . Please . EMMA : Oh ! Oh , it 's no good . Wound this size should have some stitches . - Would you know how to do it ? - No . Well , does anybody ? Paul ? - No , but I 'll have a go . - No . I can do without that . If you don 't know what they 're doing , there 's a risk of infection . Look , if you can just stop the bleeding and if you can just keep it clean , it will be all right . JENNY : Oh , it 's no good . I think the vein inside the wrist is cut . - We 'll have to do a tourniquet . - EMMA : Yeah . Emma , can you keep your thumb pressed here ? EMMA : Yes . Oh , dear . What 's happened ? - Gashed his wrist with a saw . - CHARMIAN : Oh . - CHARMIAN : Is it bad ? - Yes . CHARMIAN : Well , you 're not putting on a tourniquet ? We must stop the bleeding . Yes , but gangrene will set in . Yes , only if it 's kept on . If we can just slow the bleeding down , it might clot . It may do but it ought to have stitches . Yeah , well , do you know what to use or how to clean it ? - No . - GREG : Well , shut up ! JENNY : Greg ! - I 'm sorry , Charmian . - No , it 's my fault , I 'm sorry . How 's the other patient ? Well , she awake . She seems much better . She 's been sitting up and talking . In fact , that 's the reason that I came down here , to see if there was something for her to eat . Yes . There 's some soup in the kitchen but you 'll have to heat it up . - All right . - Now , look , take some of these . There . Now , how does that feel ? - Tight . - Good . - Thanks . - I 'll change this dressing later . Well , that 's that . With you out of action , Arthur off playing postman , and Abby gone , I 'll have to do some work . - Where 's Vic ? - With the children . Yeah , we 'll have to work something out . Children are gonna have to do more work . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) What was he like ? My husband ? Yes . You 've got me at a slight disadvantage , haven 't you ? I 'm sorry . I loved him . Yes . I just wish I could forget him but I can 't , or the life that we had together . I miss it like mad . I 'm sure you do . I think that 's the trouble really , I suddenly realised that whatever we do , however hard we work , there 's no going back . What we 've got now is what we 're gonna have for the rest of our lifetimes . Well , you won 't hear me complaining ? Now , the world 's a marvellous place , it always was . It was the people that turned it sour . We could help to sweeten it . ( CHUCKLES ) I thought I was . Stay with me . I want to . - Which means you won 't ? - ( SIGHS ) I don 't know . What about your son ? What about Peter ? I 'd given up . Why ? The others seem more important . - They ... They took you over ? - No . It 's just that I don 't know if Peter 's alive and my people are . But you don 't know that he 's dead . And there are the children . Stay with me and we 'll look for Peter together . If he 's alive , we 'll find him . Do you mean that ? I know how to face facts . We must be what we are , do what we must do . Otherwise , we don 't contribute . Contribute ? To life . To being alive . ( SOFTLY ) Stay . Well , what about what you 've got here , your settlement ? ( CHUCKLES ) They can do without me just as your people can do without you . All that 's indispensable is what we 've got . You and me . ( ABBY LAUGHS ) Do you know what I 'd like most of all in the whole wide world ? Try me . A dirty great helping of oxtail and beans . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) ( JOHN EXCLAIMS ) Hey , look , it 's Mr Russell . He 's back . We saw him coming on his bicycle . ( JOHN LAUGHS ) Oh , I 'm so glad he 's all right . - Done it . - It really worked ? - Yes . - What was the reaction ? Good , very good . They 're all sending someone . Garland wasn 't there but they 're getting a message to him . Arthur , that 's wonderful . ( CHATTERING OBSCURED BY DOOR CLOSING ) You see , just to meet other people , not to be on our own anymore , that would be a big step . ARTHUR : They are all as keen as we are . They were all worried about what would happen if they were attacked . You 'll never believe this , John , there 's one group that 's got a tank , a ruddy great tank . Does it work ? Do all the guns fire ? EMMA : Oh , John ! ARTHUR : Yes , they fire , and they 've got plenty of ammunition . I tell you , I 'd rather have them on our side if we ran into any trouble . Not the other way around if they use it to make trouble . Oh , they won 't . There 's only eight of them . My arriving on my own scared ' em half to death . ( EMMA GIGGLES ) Emma , I 'm starving . Is there anything to eat ? Of course , there is . For you , always . ( ARTHUR CHUCKLES ) ( ABBY CHUCKLES ) GARLAND : Noisy idiot . He woke you ? ( CHUCKLES ) ( HUMMING ) ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Morning . ( GARLAND MOANS ) Letter from your place . Yes . You knew about it ? I would have delivered it myself but I didn 't want them to know I was here . ( CHUCKLES ) Are you going ? Yes . Yes , I think it 's a good idea . A federation . It would work . Aren 't you going to help me find Peter ? Now , don 't play games , Abby . We can form defences and find Peter . Are you going to come with me to the meeting ? If you want me to . I 'd rather you stayed here . - It 's for lunchtime today , isn 't it ? - Mmm . In that case , let 's not waste any time . ( GARLAND CHUCKLES ) Hello , Greg . How 's your wrist ? ( SIGHS ) Uh , numb . What about the girl ? Her name 's Ruth and she 's much , much better . Come and meet her . Ruth , this is Greg Preston . Hi , Ruth . How 're you feeling ? RUTH : Much better . Thank you for taking me in . Well , don 't thank me . I was all for throwing you out . JENNY : Greg ! But you were quite right . You 've got children here , haven 't you ? I might have been infectious , contagious . I still could be . But you took me in and I 'm very grateful . Oh , it 's the least we could do . - RUTH : Have you any soap ? - Yes . Then keep me isolated for , say , about a week , and then wash your hands thoroughly every time you come in here . ( CHUCKLES ) You sound just like a doctor . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , dear , sorry . JENNY : Would you like something to eat ? Oh , I 'd prefer something to drink . Okay . I 'll get you something . Greg will sit with you for a while . RUTH : Thank you . GREG : Where you from ? What 's wrong with your arm ? Oh , well , it 's my wrist . I gashed it with a saw . - When ? - Yesterday . - Is that a tourniquet ? - Uh-huh . Is the cut that bad ? GREG : No , I 'll show you . RUTH : No , don 't uncover it . Call Jenny back . - ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah , but I 'll look silly ... - Please call Jenny back . - Jenny ? - JENNY : Yes . - Would you come back a second ? - JENNY : I 'm coming . - Can you feel your fingers ? - What ? ( CHUCKLES ) Sorry . I mean , have you any feeling in them at all ? Yeah , like hell , but when I loosen this ... Oh , good , you do loosen it . And when you do , do you get any bleeding ? GREG : Yes , but , I don 't ... - Yes ? - That arm 's got to be attended to . - You are a doctor ? - No . Well , I 'm not qualified , I finished my third year . JENNY : Ah ! RUTH : I can 't do anything , it 's too risky . - You 'll have to do it for me . - Oh ! But I 'll tell you what to do , all right ? Yes , I suppose so . - Now , have you a needle and thread ? - Yes . ( SIGHS ) I felt sure they 'd come , one of them at least . Give ' em time . Well , if they were coming they 'd be here by now . Oh , well . I suppose I 'd better get on with something . I was in Reading when it all happened , at the training hospital . I left with a doctor and a nurse and we went up the river in a cruiser . On the second day , the doctor got ill . We couldn 't save him . After that , we just went up and down the river looking for people . And is that what you were doing when they found you ? No , I was on my way to Cirencester looking for some sulphonamide drugs . I don 't really remember much about it . ( CHUCKLES ) One moment , I was on a bike and then I was here . There . That 's all right , isn 't it ? RUTH : Yes , that 's fine . What happened to the nurse ? - Peggy ? Oh , she 's still there . - Where ? Oh , I 'm sorry , I 'm still a bit muzzy . Um , Kempsford . You see , we found some people living on a barge . We stayed with them three months until some of them got food poisoning . That 's when I went for the drugs . How long have I been ill ? Well , I 'd say , it 's been about a week since you were found . Oh ! Well , we 'll be too late , now . How many were on the barge ? Seven of us . Two women , three men and two young boys . What were their names ? Ted Glover , George Bronson , I think it was , he was a school master , deaf , Peggy Marshall ... Just a minute . What were the boys names ? Oh , Christian names . Stuart ... Stuart Kirby , - Peter ... Peter ... Peter Clark ... - Grant ? Sorry . Clark , I think it was . GREG : You sure ? You sure it 's not Grant ? Peter Grant ? Yes , that 's it . Do you know him ? No .

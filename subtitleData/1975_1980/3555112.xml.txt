 On that day I was driving on call to a mountain hotel . The hotel 's name was " Dead Mountaineer 's Hotel " , and the road there was quite difficult . DEAD MOUNTAINEER 'S HOTEL Many years have passed since that time , hovewer quite often , during the dull duties or sleepless nights , I recall what happened , and even now I cannot decide , whether was I right at that time or not . Screenplay by Arkady STRUGATSKY and Boris STRUGATSKY Directed by Grigori KROMANOV Director of Photography Jüri SILLART Production Designer Tõnu VIRVE Music by Sven GRÜNBERG The strange thing is that I can tell noone , about how it actually happened , neither to my wife , nor to friends , nor to authorities . The only person who knows whole truth is myself . TALLINNFILM 1979 This is the mountaineer . He was hit by the avalanche . He flew 500 meter toward his death . - How do you do ! - Welcome ! Let me introduce myself - Alex Snewahr , the owner of this hotel , this valley , nearby mountains and gorges . And this is Lel , the loyal friend of deceased . I am a police inspector Peter Glebsky . - What happened here ? - Sorry ? - You called the police . - Me ? Hallo , captain , this is Glebsky . I am glad to report that nothing happened here ... Yes , false alarm . What ? No , I can 't come back today . There is a fog in the mountains . What ? Ah , wine ? Well , OK . - As I understand , someone of my guests ... Alas . My sincere apologies . It 's OK . I " l be delighted to spend here this evening and night and I 'm going to try your famous " Edelweiss " . My wine-cellars are at your service ! Lel ! Room seven ! - It was nice to fly , wasn 't it ? - Yes . Well ? Thanks , Lel , you can go now . Well , what beauties you have here ! Just as in Hollywood . How do you do ! Yeah ! It 's beautiful here ! I am Peter Glebsky , inspector of the police . - Hinckus . - Nice to meet you . I just arrived . Have you been here for a long time ? I have tuberculosis . I need fresh air , all doctors say it to me . I 'm sorry . Is this a call for the dinner ? We have to go . What about you ? I will go later . Oho , what are you doing up there ? May I help ? Let me introdusce myself , Simon Simone , Lieutenant from cybernetics . It is funny , isn 't it ? Stand easy . Police inspector Peter Glebsky . In fact , I am a physicist . Four years without vacation . Project " Midas " . Have you heard ? Top secret . Yes . I came here for mountain climbing , but here is to much snow , can 't get anywhere . So I am climbing the walls . Doctors prescribed me the course of sensual pleasures . Imagine , Aleksandr is coming to this place . Gentlemen , let me introduce to you inspector Glebsky . This is my distant relative Brun . - Next to her is Olaf Andvarafors . - How do you do . Mrs. Mozes , please . I adore police ! These heroes , these dare-devils ... Are you a dare-devil , inspector ? Alas , Madame , I am a common police officer . I do not believe . Man with such look cannot be anything else but dare-devil ! Oh , really ? How do you do , gentlemen . Mr. Mozes , let me introduce our guest , inspector Glebsky . My pleasure . Mr. Mozes . We talked about aliens . I have to say that I completely share Mr. Deniken 's opinion , that aliens repeatedly attended our planet . Your Deniken is a charlatan . You are a physicist , Simone , meaning you are a rationalist . However this question relates to the realm of poetry . Mr. inspector , but what do you think about this ? I am even stronger rationalist , I am a policeman . Everything that surrounded me there , in that comfortable hotel , nice owner , somewhat strange guests and amazingly beautiful mountains , everything promised a pleasant evening . Mentally I thanked the captain who sent me here . Mr. inspector , you are a real man . Please beat this Olaf . Ah , Olaf , now the police will make stake out of you . - Steak is a food . - Then he will make food from you ! - Why ? - To eat ! But we just had a dinner . It 's impossible to talk to you ! Why ? In my opinion , we have a very good conversation . However beefsteak - is nevertheless a food . And to make a food from me ... inspector will not be able to . - I am glad . - Me too . - Let 's go . - Let 's go . Bye . Oo , Simone , you are incredible . Just as a monkey . Excuse me , it seems I am called . I have to leave . Who called her ? Did you hear anything ? What a woman ! Yes . You dropped something ! Ah , thanks . Something bad ? No , do not worry . What are you doing , Mozes ? After three moves you 'll have no castle . And who is this Mr. Mozes ? He signed up as a travelling businessman . But I have no idea about his destination . Here is the dead end . The road ends here , and you can only go back . It is bad to hide yourself , Mr. inspector . I offer you a dance . What a beautiful wiev ! Isn 't it ? Hinckus is still on the roof . I pity him . Why ? I don 't like him ! I am sorry , Mrs. Mozes , but you promised me one dance . Simone got me sober . Yes , I became drunk . Was it caused by wine , mrs . Mozes , or something else , I do not know . But I felt , that I have to have some air . And I had to do something with the anonymous letter , that was thrust into my pocket . It read : " Hinckus is dangerous gangster , maniac and killer , called Owl , he is preparing a murder . Do something . " Hinckus ! Hinckus ! Hinckus ... Hinckus ... Hinckus ... What ? What happened ? Olaf ! You also have no power ? Quiet , gentlemen , quiet , please ! The light will be back in two minutes . Everything will be allright . I will turn on our backup generator . There was no sign of life in Hinckus ' room . As if he vanished into thin air . Of course this was not a weapon of a criminal . But why then Hinkus keeps this lady 's toy in his suitcase ? It looked like someone attempts to set him up as a dangerous criminal . But who ? Kaysa , come quickly here ! Kaysa ! - What 's wrong with him ? - I don 't know , perhaps he is frozen . - And who is he ? - I don 't know . Brandy , quick ! Are you sleeping ? Wait , I will bring it myself . As a piece of ice . But perhaps he is a friend of Mr. Hinckus ? - Mr. Hinckus ? - Yes ! I heard him dictating the telegram : " I am waiting for you , come quickly . " Yes , things look bad . We have no connection , the telephone is dead . This landsliding cut us off completely . It will take them a week to dig us up . There is even no handkerchief . - Are you alone ? - He is weak . Is somebody expecting you ? Olaf . Olaf Andvarafors . Olaf ! Olaf ! This is strange . The door is locked from inside . My God ... What 's wrong with him ? He is dead . - Is it his suitcase ? - Yes . - Is this his entire baggage ? - No , only this suitcase . Do not tell anybody about this . Check the garage - if any car is missing . If you see Hinckus , try to detain him . Go now . OK . The hand of the corpse was stretched and it almost was touching a small suitcase . Olaf 's head was unnaturally wildly turned back . What a monstrous power should killer have ? Who did it ... Tell me , who it was ? Who tied you ? How do I know ? What time is it ? One in the morning . One in the morning ! One in the morning ! One in the morning ! Be quiet ! Be quiet ! Shut up , Hinckus ! - Who strangled you ? - I don 't know . - When did it happen ? - Around ten . - Do you suspect someone ? - No-no , no-no , I don 't know ! From behind ! I don 't know ! I don 't know ! No , no , no ! Don 't be so foolish ! I ... I ... I ... I ... I swear to you , I swear to you , I did not kill this woman ! She was already absolutely cold when I embraced her . Stop ! - She ... She was ... - Shut up ! OK . Now talk . Tell me , what happened . Here is what happened . Even before she made passes at , but I hesitated ... However this evening ... A-A-A-A-A ... She was absolutely dead . I swear to you ! - Come with me ! - Where ? To prison ! To punishment room ! To chamber of tortures ! Idiot . Now . Just a moment . Put your trousers on ! Please forgive me ... I swear to you , I swear ... I was tipsy , yes , but not as much , not to the level of missing the obvious . Look . Here is something related to your profession . It is very interesting . - Where did you find this ? - In Olaf 's suitcase . Yes ? I don 't understand . Weird mechanism . No , not my speciality . This is something military ... or from space . Be careful with this ! It can be dangerous for the health . Allright . Go to bed . No , no , no ... that 's madness ! This caps it all ! Something military or from space ! That 's better ! This is the most secure place for it . Take the key ! Alex . Are you sure that Olaf and Brun did leave the hall ... between 10 and 10 : 30 ? Yes . Absolutely sure . Thanks . It is very important . - What the hell ! - Turn it off ! - 3AM ... - Remove this lamp ! Get out ! What 's your business here ? Do not scream ! Tell me , where and when you saw Olaf last time ? Why must I speak about ? Go out ! Go to hell , damned cop ! Stop it ! There was a murder in the hotel and I am investigating it . And ... who is this unfortunate one ? I will tell you later . But now listen to me . I know that you left Olaf between ten and ten thirty . - And wat 's next ? - I don 't know anything else about him . Ok . Possible . Perhaps you saw somebody in the hall ? Have somebody passed you ? Mrs. Mozes , perhaps . No ? Hinckus was walking along the hall . Hinckus . Hinckus ... Hinckus ? After ten a clock ? How was he dressed ? In this stupid fur coat . Listen to , Hinckus , I 'm tired of you . Why did you lie about being strangled at ten , if they saw you after ten ? A ... Tahat 's exactly the point ! Inspector ! They saw me in the hall ... and I saw ... myself . And I strangled myself . I ... myself ... Did you understand ? I ... myself ! Until this moment I haven 't made a single mistake . No , one mistake , and quite important one , I did made . I did not sense danger . At that time I had to ... I had to figure out that this history was uncommon . But I did not . I was lost , didn 't know whom to suspect . Women were out of question . Old Mozes too . Hinkus was tied in the bed . But may be someone was disguised as Hinckus ? I don 't like it here ! I don 't like your hotel ! All these examinations , murders , landslidings , dogs , your bluntness . And what does police do ? It breaks in the middle of the night into my wife 's room ! How can you humilate a man like this ! My wife in this case ! I understand you , Mr. Mozes , but nevertheless I would like ... I already know that you will not turn back and you will not leave my wife until you get anwers to your foolish questions . Well , but remeber , only two questions . Yes . Thanks . I hope you understand , I 'm investigaing a murder , and therefore it 's very important ... Oo , gentlemen ! It 's a wonderful night , isn 't it ? Please , take a seat . Mrs. , I have to apologize , that I broke in at night , but I had enough time to note that you did not sleep . Tell me , did something awake you ? Yes . I actually did not sleep . But I cannot say that anything woke me up . - And you did not hear anything ? - No , nothing . And you did not hear landsliding ? Landsliding ? What landsloding ? Nothing terrible , I will tell you later . Another question . Yesterday after nine thirty you were living the room . Tell me , did yo anybody in the hall ? It seems to me ... Of course ! When I was coming back , I saw Olaf and Brun . They held each other hands and talked as lovers . Thanks , mrs . Mozes . You greatly helped investigation . The killed is Olaf ! I know , you were the last one , who saw him alive . You lied to me , that you parted at the room 's doors . Where did you parted ? Where , when and how ? What is it ? Quickly ! Go ! Go away ! Go now ! And I haven 't seen him anymore . I am sorry for you , inspector . You are on a wrong path . Your professional experience is meaningless here . Just as a time makes no sense , when exceeding the speed of light . - Listen , Aleks , I like you . - I like you too . But if you are going to fool me , I will start suspecting you . That means , you will be in troubles . Yes , of course . What can we do ... You are not ripe yet . I 'm over-ripened . I will fall off soon . Some tribes of Middle-Africa ... know , how to revive their dead mates . This phenomenon is called zomby . Perhaps zomby is the third state of living organisms . I was tired and I was a total mess . While listening to Snewahr 's zombies I didn 't notice how I fell asleep . What ? What is it ? What happens ? Where did this came from ? Did you bring it ? The only possibility is that the gun was dropped from the roof . Therefore that was Hinckus , who was waiting for somebody . Inspector ! Inspector , I 'm looking for you ! Your patient regained consiousness ! Where is Olaf Andvarafors ? Excuse me , but I 'd like to ask you a couple of questions . What is your name ? Luarvik . - And first name ? - Luarvik . Mr. Luarvik Luarvik ? Yes . Well . Who are you ? Are you foreigner ? Very . To the high degree . Do not enter ! Please leave immediately , Mr. Mozes ! Do not shout at me . I am living , if this is what you wish . I have to tell you that Olaf Andvarafors was killed today at night . Killed ? A corpse ? You do not know . I saw him myself , he is dead . - I want to see him . - Why ? I have a business with him . Did he need to pass something to you ? No . I have a talk to him . What about ? To him . To him ! Listen to , Mr. Luarvik . I am investigating a murder . Do you understand ? Sooner or later you 'll tell me everything . Remeber , you may get into big troubles . Why ? Do you want to identify the corpse ? Correct ? Identify . Recognize . How can you recognize him , if you haven 't seen his face ? Why face ? What face ? Get dressed ! This is Olaf Andavrafors . - That 's strange . - How did you recoginze him ? Recalled . Seen him . And where did you see him ? Elsewhere . Not important this is . Are you looking for something ? May be a suitcase ? Where it is ? I got it . This good . Bring it . OK . But first you will answer my questions . Why ? Why again questions ? I do not want questions . I ... I ... I want to lie down . Where you have a place to lie down ? What do I have to think about this ? I am almost convinced , that Olaf , Luarvik and Mozes belong to the same gang , which does not want to be advertized . But Hinckus - this is his revolver - he is also somehow connected to them . Just that 's where I 've made my major error - I connected Mozes and Luarvik with the Olaf 's murder . May be we hold Hinkus locked up for nothing ? Let 's set him free ... as a fox into the hen house . Snevar ! Please make sure , that everybody will be having breakfast in the morning . Good morning , Simone ! Good morning , Brun ! - Good morning , inspector ! - Good morning ! - How did you sleep ? - Good , thanks . You look bad . - Well , did you find anything ? - It depends . You know , I have a feeling , that there is a smell of death here . Beautiful morning . It is so warm and sunny . Poor Olaf - he did not live to see this morning . Good morning , gentlemen . Let me to introduce you Mr. Luarvik Luarvik . He arrived last night . It 's nice . Gentlemen ! We are temporarily cut off from the outer world . I understand you well . We all are under pressure . But don 't forget , that investigation is in inspector Glebsky 's reliable hands . Attention , please . I have to report the following . Some rascals selected this hotel as the place where to clear their scores . I want you to know , that two hours ago with the help of Mr. Snewahr I sent with the carrier pigeon report to the local police . A police helicopter may be here any minute now . Therefore I suggest to those scoundrels to stop their criminal activity . I warn you ! Otherwise your position will be entirely hopeless . Thank you for attention , gentlemen . Ah , how interesting ! Does it mean , that there are bandits among us ? I wanted to scare them , although I knew that these legends will not help me . We were cut off from the outer world and I could rely only at myself . Wait ! Wait , Hinckus ! - We have to talk . - About what ? Sit down . Of course , police tricks ... Such is my job . Well , Owl , talk now . Your frank confession before investigation starts is your only chance . You are getting confused , inspector . - What owl are you talking about ? - Is this your tool ? I do not understand you , inspector . What you do want ? Think , and think quickly , it will serve you better . Your friends will not come in time . But the police - it will arrive now . Take that ... And that ... Inspector , where did he hit you ? Your arm ? You were lucky , inspector . Very lucky . Take bottle and pour some water on his head . He regained consciousness . Well , Owl , will we talk ? Damn it ! I am sick of all this ! Ask . If I only knew how to answer . - Who are you ? - Have you heard about the chastisers ? - Sure ! - I am one of them . But here ! Here is the real horror ! Believe me , inspector , some super-natural forces are involved . Cut the crap ! Stick to the point ! Half a year ago one guy approached us . No one knew his name . They called him Master . They would assign absolutely impossible tasks to him . Do you remember the Second National Bank ? That 's his job . But suddenly he did not want to work with us any more . Stopped cold turkey . Oh yes . All that time he was a bit nuts . He wouldn 't let us to kill hostages and and actually no one . He said we shouldn 't . That 's why he had a fight with Boss . And then he disappeared . With his assistant and wife . And I was ordered by Boss to find him . And you found them here . Who they are ? No ! You tell to me , who they are ! What a man could cope with me as I were a kitten ? - And she did . - Who " she " ? Who ? This woman . Mozes understood that I will not let him out alive . So he set his wife against me . She was approaching directly at me . You will not believe it , but I was approaching myself ! Until now , I do not understand , how I managed not go crazy . Who is Olaf ? Is he also from your gang ? Listen , inspector ! I know nothing about Olaf . I did not put a finger on him . Ihave to say , that Mozes will not kill . He just can 't do it . That 's why he did not touch me . Is Boss coming alone ? Nonsence ! He always has three guys with him . What did he intend to do with Mozes ? To kill , of cource . Simone , please ... Simone ! Open ! Simone ! Where are you , Simone ! Simone ! Simone ! Simone ! Simone ! Simone ! Simone . Simone . Simone disappeared . By now it was necessary to stop Mozes at any cost . Alex ! Come here ! - Everything is quiet here . - Let 's go . Don 't worry , inspector . They can not reach us by car . Do you think that terrorists do not have helicopters ? I am surprised , that they are not here yet . Let 's go , Alex . Don 't be scared . To the wall ! Don 't move ! Stop this hypnosis ! Mr. Mozes ! You are charged with National Bank robbery and Olaf Andvarafors ' murder . Inspector ! They are not people ! They are aliens from another planet . Yes , of course , they arrived directly from Venus ! I don 't know , where they came from . From another universe , or from another galaxy . Only thing I know is that they are in trouble and we have to help them . Put off your weapon , inspector . Mr. Mozes arrived here as an observer . He made a fatal mistake . He was not allowed to contact . Yes , this is true . But when I saw , how you live here , I broke the rule . I wanted to help you so much . But your life proved to be too complex for me . Mr. Mozes was deceived ! They enticed him to fight for the justice but it turned out that these were gangsters . He ran into this hotel so that he could leave our planet . Here in the mountains is our launch pad . But landsliding destroyed the power plant , which feeded our robots . And our pilot Luarvik was severely injured . His spacesuit is broken and he is weakening every second . - Give them back Olaf 's suitcase ! - Do not babble , Simone ! Olaf is not killed . Olaf is a robot . And mrs . Mozes is also a robot . Do you remember , after the landsliding she was dead , and now , as you see , she is alive . Because Mr. Mozes turned on the backup battery last night . There is one more backup battery in the Olaf 's suitcase , which feeds ... Which feeds your sick imagination , Mr. Physicist ! By mysticism and by fantasy it is possible to explain everything very logically . Glebski , return them the suitcase ! Right in front of you they will turn on Olaf and then they will leave . - I don 't buy this ! - But why ? You 'd have the unbeatable proof ! Why have you stopped talking ? You have noting to say ? I am not a scientist , I am a police officer . There are too many lies about this suitcase . - Listen ! - Enough ! Was it you , who called the police here ? Yes , I did it . OK . And the note is also your job ? Yes . I hoped that you will be distracting Hinckus . Of course , and you will avoid responsibility . Bad , clumsy work . The mask of alien does not fit you , and robots are not robots at all . Do you want to say , that our robots are too human-like ? " Let them talk what they want " , I thought . " Let Olaf and this woman are robots , it 's even worse " . " In the hands of terrorists they will become a horrible weapon . " Clearly I selected poor mask for myself . It 's a pity , that I cannot show you my real face . I know your real face , Mr. Mozes . With the nickname Master ! I must turn you back into the hands of law . I stared at them , and for some reason I felt bad . Very bad . I dreamed about a miracle to happen . I wanted the phone to talk and give me orders . What to do . What to do . Inspector ! - Inspector ! - So , what ? They say you can return him to the life . No one can be returned to the life , this is fairy tales , Brun , fairy tales . No , please listen to me ! I beg you , please revive him ! If Olaf is a doll , then may be I am also a doll ! How do I know ? Now I am really alone . Only you can help me , only you , Mr. Inspector . I beg you ! Yes , I understood , that Brun is foolish freakish girl . Hinckus is illiterate and superstitious criminal . And Simone is half-witted physicist with crazy ideas . But anyway I felt , that they were right , and not me . My experience , my senses , rebelled against this truth . Their truth seemed impossible , absurd . In order to perform my duties as a policeman , it was necessary for me to use my entire , accumulated over forty years of work , conservatism and conformism . A sense of duty was only thing remaining with me . The policeman 's sense of duty , embedded into my flesh and blood . Simone ! Go to the roof and watch the sky ! And we with Alex will remain here , in the hall . Luarvik is dying . Mozes said that he will live not more than an hour . Will you let him die , Glebsky ? I am a policeman , and I have no right to punishment and forgiveness . The only thing I know , that there is a law . One law for everybody ! According to this law your Mozes is a criminal and a killer . And my responsibility is to deliver him to the court . Here is the encounter of two worlds . Just think , to arrive here , God knows from where and to meet first terrorists , and then such law enforcement officer as you , Glebsky . I don 't believe in aliens . And if they are aliens , what 's their business here ? Observers . What they observe , how do you think ? And how the " observers " from other countries are called ? Look , Simone , I am a citizen of this country . And not simply a citizen as you , arcane chatterbox , but rather a government official with certain responsibilities ! So , are you dreaming about another star on your shoulder straps ? What a pity ! A little police pawn ! This is the only and the last time in you life , when the fate entrusted you a decision of real importance , and you behave as complete idiot ! Key is in the pocket ! Be quiet ! Lel ! - You too ! - Do not move , you 'll hurt yourself ! There is no such law ... Goodbye , people ! Till the real contact ! There they are ! Damn ! That was the end of everything . I felt just total indifference . Only in the depth of my heart I cowardly felt some relief . The situation no longer depended on me . Responsibility was taken over by others . You see ! You 've got what you wanted ! Policeman ! Hero ! Save us god and forgive . Well ? Why are you staring at me ? No ! I acted correctly . I performed my duty . Duty . I did not brake law , it was sacred for me . You are saying that this entire strange crew have died ? Well , so what ? Listen , let us be logical . If they are people , then they are criminals and they got what they deserved . If they are not criminals ... but then they are not people ! And why should I care about them , nonhumans , anyway ? Disguised as people ! Is it logical ? It is logical . Then I am right ? Then I acted correctly ! THE END Translation : Valentin Abramov

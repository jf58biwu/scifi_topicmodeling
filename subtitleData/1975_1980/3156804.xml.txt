 'We 're just preparing the charges now . ' but there it is . It doesn 't make sense . there is an atmosphere source inside this asteroid . Inside ... Commander . 'We 're three light years from the nearest star system . to get this far at its present velocity 000 years . ' Commander ? Commander . ' trigger it . Victor . Yeah . Let 's take a look . An airlock . Atmosphere breathable . Could support some other form of life . No . No use . stand clear . Visors down ! Jim . I think we 'll need some more explosives . you all right ? - I 'm all right . I think so . Commander . - I doubt if he 'll make it . - That explosion ripped him apart . let 's get him back to Alpha as quickly as we can . - Let 's go . Lift ! John ... as far as I could see ... there 's nothing else here . It 's a one-room world . check Baxter out . - Right . Run a check on Baxter . Dr Russell . - Oxygen ? - Respiratory 's stable . - Vital signs ? Erratic . please . Useless . He 's dead . you tried . What now ? I suppose . the blast hit you harder than the rest of us . Medical seems to think there might be some damage . if I 'm grounded I want to know why . Just give them a chance to check you out . As soon as you 're clear you can fly again . all right ? Yeah . If you say so . John ! Just a little while ago he was severely injured . He was mutilated beyond description . I know because I dressed his wounds . he was severely injured and everything indicated that he 'd died . He is completely healed . Doctor ... - Have you checked this ? - No mistake . What is it ? These figures indicate the rate of the alien cell replacement process . His body is regenerating cells so fast they don 't have time to decay . There 's no cell decay . His body ... is being held in some sort of stasis . please . that asteroid 's been out in space for maybe a thousand years . is it possible that he 's been out there all that time ? anything is possible . I 'm gonna put two security men outside . No one is to have access to this room without permission . This is a rock sample from the asteroid from the atmosphere chamber I 've bombarded it with anti-matter to break down its molecule structure So to all intents it should have ceased to exist . Like this . But I switch off the disintegrator ... and now look . Yeah . That 's the same piece of rock . regenerated . Just like the cell structure of the alien when his injuries healed because it 's something I haven 't come across before . But my guess is that it 's not really a rock at all scrape it blast it bombard it with anti-matter and somehow it 'll regenerate itself . is it organic matter or was it created for some specific purpose ? of course it 's possible that it 's something like the ... prevent people like us from getting in . Or to prevent him from getting out . - How do I look ? - Fine . You can sit up now . when do I get back to flying ? check the tests first . checks . Doctor . It was a pleasure . Grounded . - For good ? - I know what this means to you . Well ... What 's the story ? Your optic nerve . It 's been severely damaged . I 'm sorry . Leave me alone . - Leave me alone . - Yeah . Commander ! 'The alien 's escaped from security . ' assembly area D. Use the kill ray . I must ... talk to you . My name ... is Balor . I am a citizen of the planet ... Progueron . Why did you attack our people ? I mean your people no harm . to help you . I understand that now . But when you blasted your way into the asteroid disorientated . I asked myself " What is happening ? Why should people do this to me ? What is this nightmare ? " and then I am attacked by your guards . I defend myself to try to understand ... each other . - Yes ? - It was fear that made our people react as they did . a service which leaves me deeply in your debt . I have a question . I used a full blast kill laser . - I don 't understand why you 're not dead . - Of course you don 't . My powers are no accident of evolution . as you are . Our scientists began to experiment with the ... forces of life and death . They found first ... a means to eliminate the ageing process in ... living tissue . until they achieved total mastery of cell regeneration . Until finally ... they realised that death was defeated . That immortality itself ... was possible . - Your people achieved immortality ? - Yes . and I have lived for over a thousand of your years . that asteroid was out in space a very long time . Why were you inside it ? I will tell you what happened on my world . you will ... begin to understand . Our people accepted the gift of eternal life offered by science . corrupt . became negative . When some of us realised what was happening we tried to instil in our people the thought that only death gives a purpose to life . That a full response to life can only be measured against a fear of death . How can you value life if you do not fear death ? my efforts failed . How can you teach immortals to feel like mortals ? Our world was in chaos . Our leaders lacked vision . which offered a way out . A means to ... transcend the limitations of the human spirit . but in the end they turned on me . I was the enemy . The cause of all their misfortune . A prison was constructed out of living rock . And I was shut in ... to suffer ... eternal solitude for what were considered my crimes . - Can we do anything for you ? - I belong nowhere . To no one . My need is sanctuary . at least for the present . Be our guest . sir . Thank you all . Helena . Victor ? I 'm inclined to believe him . Why ? how long it 's been out in space . - It adds up . - Does it ? Helena ? It makes sense . Immortality 's possible . would we have chosen differently ? would we punish the man who offered us a way out ? - What are you saying ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . But why would civilised people punish a man in such a diabolical way ? And what about the paintings inside the asteroid ? How do they fit in ? Terror . Destruction . Torture . Right . Maybe that was Balor 's solution . Maybe that 's what he offered his people . Can we assume that ? He was in that asteroid for a long time . Maybe he painted them himself ? Or they 're to remind him of something . Something he hasn 't told us about . run a constant check on Balor 's whereabouts . Commander . ' - What do you want ? - I can understand you resenting me Can you ? don 't you ? what is it ? And your ... minor disability 's taken the joy of flying away from you . - What do you want with me ? - Perhaps I can help you . Balor has just entered Mike Baxter 's quarters . ' Kano . I 'm glad you 're feeling better about things . Balor was here . What did he want ? Baxter got the jump on me . He went completely berserk . violent . He was still battering me when ... when I passed out . And yet look at me now . There isn 't a mark on me . I don 't know what the hell 's going on . - I want a report on the death cause - We 'll rush an autopsy through . - where have we seen that before ? - Inside the asteroid . Those pictures on the walls . Balor could have regenerated your injuries . But why ? What 's he up to ? He 's trying to take over . What other reason could there be ? Then why didn 't he kill you ? It doesn 't make sense . No . But it 's beginning to . locate Balor . Have him come to my office . Commander ? - Yes . a man called Baxter ? He 's now dead . Is he ? What did you do to him ? that you did something to his mind that made him attack me viciously . then you healed me . Exact ? everything that you say is absolutely correct . Why ? Commander . A foretaste of what is to come . Balor . - Who are you to judge ? immortals . But here it will be different . geared for my precise purpose you will follow my way . I have plans here . you ... left something there very precious to me . My paintings . Of course you noticed them . Scenes of terror and torture . Chaos . Destruction . Yes . I know now that they were put there to remind you of what you did to your people . Koenig . And a thousand years of reflection have convinced me ... I was right . And now I have found a golden opportunity to prove it . With you . Koenig ! Surrender to the exquisite forces of pain and suffering and you ... will ... transcend your limitations ! and what you offer is evil . We will resist you and what you stand for . don 't make me kill you . I have to be careful with mortals . You have the release of death . Baxter was too lucky . I want you alive . your people . You belong to me . And I will do with you as I wish . And you will come to accept ... what I have to offer . You 'll see . - No . - How will you stop me ? - Kill me ? - We 'll find a way . Somehow . So you will not do as I command ? You 'll have to kill me first . I offered your commander a choice . He refused . There will be death and destruction on this base until he agrees . A killer who can 't be killed . It 's insane . He can do what he wants and he knows it . damage reports are coming in . Balor 's tearing Alpha apart . Paul . He won 't destroy us . Not yet . hold out . We 've got to find some way to fight him or we 're finished . nice and easy . you 've heard of my powers of healing ? Your medical functions here are now obsolete . I am in control of this unit and I shall determine whether or not my function is obsolete . you are . has possibilities . Possibilities that will amaze you . And may even ... interest you . Get out of here . Every time that I ask for your help and you deny it I will inflict pain . And it will get worse . But I will not kill you . the situation ? damage to the research labs - do you want me to go on ? - He 's destroying everything . - ' John ? ' - He was just here . - Go on . 'One of our orderlies . Balor is a cold-blooded killer . ' Evacuate the medical centre and get over here . Where is he now ? Reported heading towards area B. - Get our people out of there . - Wait Paul . Balor 's gonna hear that Right . I 'll put it through the comlocks . - Main Mission to area B. - I think there 's a way we could slow him up . How ? We can isolate him on one of the sections turn the whole area into a vacuum . out into space . not now . Not unless we forced him to . get him on the screen . 'Balor ! ' You agree to my terms ? Balor . ' Koenig ! I will ... ' sir . I 'm going in there . Seal all doors behind me . depressurise . You crazy ? You can 't fight him ! I know that ! Do you want me to invite him to leave ? Victor . I know ! - What 's happening ? - He 's in there to take Balor alone . Commander . Door . Koenig ? - Thinking . Thinking about accepting my offer ? Balor . Koenig . I need a little more time . Koenig . Balor . Koenig . All right . Koenig . I 've already waited ... a thousand years ! Koenig ! - He 'll kill him ! - Alan ! We gotta help . Koenig . - I need you on Alpha . - Never ! Now ! Paul . Alan . we 're lucky we survived . we unleashed him . We interfered with another people 's justice . We must learn to leave some things alone . - But he could have given us immortality . - No . Price was too high . let 's get this place into shape ! Let 's go !

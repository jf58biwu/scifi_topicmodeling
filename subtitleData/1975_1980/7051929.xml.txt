 - Coffee . - Thanks . - Sandra , coffee . - Thank you . No thanks . Sandra ? It 's still quite a distance away and holding course . How close will it pass us ? Close . David , have you got those figures yet ? It 's a fair size asteroid but nothing to worry about . Hmm . Estimate the damage potential just in case . There 's no need . It won 't collide with us . Just in case . Paul ! Central Computer gave the collision alarm . The asteroid 's changed course ! Like it 's been pulled . Kano , pinpoint impact area . - Problem ? - An asteroid . Commander , collision course reaffirmed . Impact area - Alpha . - How much time do we have ? - Under a minute . No time to secure the base . It 's changing course ! Commander , it 's impossible , but WE 'RE changing course . Switch to starboard camera . What is it ? Whatever it is , we 're headed right into it . 'Eagle 1 to Alpha . 'I 'm in position . What a sight ! ' It 's round . It 's huge . It 's black . Boy , is it black ! - What 's his position ? - 7-7-9-0-4 . Where the asteroid was first caught . Give me your sensor readings , Mike . Sir , I 'm not getting anything . 'Nothing 's bouncing back from it . ' Same here , no readings . 'Does anyone have any idea what it is ? ' 'Degrees of cosine adjacent to opposing angle of ... ' I ought to know better than to ask you . 'Still holding position , sir . ' It 's our move , Commander . What 's the power of the antigravity screens ? 'They 're only on half power . ' See how it reacts to the laser . 'Will do . ' Well ! It swallows laser light too . 'What next ? ' Video reception. ls the fault with his equipment or ours ? There 's no fault . It should be clear , Michael 's between us and the object . ... T , no T squared . Of course ... Now ... There 's only one thing to do - get in closer . - ' Negative , Mike . ' - All it has is a lot of gravity . With my screens on maximum power I should be all right . Alpha is headed right into it . We have to find out what it is . Come on . 'Hypothesis proven . 'It is your duty to report this danger ... ' Yeah , one jump ahead of you , Computer . Switching on anti-gravity screens to full power . - Sandra ? - Right here , Michael . - ' Don 't go away , be right back . ' - I will be waiting . 'Here I go , Alpha . ' Monitor his anti-gravity screens , they 're in the red . Confirmed . - John ! - Abort , Mike . Abort . Pull out . Pull out , Mike ! You 're heading right into it . Blast yourself out of there ! Full power . Full power ! - Get him out . - He 's accelerating . We can 't hold him . - Why did I wait so long ? - Now , John , you didn 't know . Neither did I. If anyone 's to blame , it 's me . I suspected it hours ago . A black sun . Right . - What are we going to do about it ? - What can we do ? We 'll all be dead in three clays . A black sun ? Mmm . Unfortunately , we couldn 't be sure until it was too late to save Mike . But you think we can avoid it ? Its gravitational pull can become so immense that just a hatful of it can weigh more than several Alphas . But it doesn 't stop there . The gravity increases so nothing , not radiation , not heat , not even light can escape . Its force is immeasurable . Even Computer cannot determine it . You didn 't answer my question . Do you think we can avoid it ? I thought I did . Paul asked if we could avoid the gravitational force of a black sun . The answer is no . However , we may be able to use it to our advantage . Victor . Mmm . As you know , these eight anti-gravity towers stabilise our gravity in Alpha . And we 'll use them to create an entirely new force-field effect . By linking and cross-linking the anti-gravity screens in each of the towers , the force-field will look something like this . I 've stripped all the generators out of our Eagles . We 'll use them to support the main units . But Computer will have to be deactivated for the force-field . Yes , well , um ... It could do with a rest . We 'll reprogram our main unit generators so that instead of negating the pressure from the black sun , it will simply reverse it . The closer we get , the stronger the force-field becomes . In theory , the pressure of the force-field will eventually compel the pressure of the black sun to protect us against itself . It 's a long shot , but there 's nothing else we can do . It 's ingenious . It 's insane . Sandra , I wanted you to have more rest . I know , Doctor . But there is so much to do . Paul , where is Commander Koenig ? With the Professor ... out there . Victor , we really shouldn 't be out here . It 's the only way to make our point . Shall we ? Why not ? - Full power , Paul . - Switching to full power . It is beautiful , like fish scales . You can cut through fish scales . 'Give me a reading , Paul . ' Maximum power , steady and holding . 'You 've got a full house , we 're all with you . ' Good luck . We 're all set , Alan . Commander , you can still change your mind . If we had any sense , we would . Make it good . Come in as low as you can . Hang onto your hats . Incredible stupidity . The risk to both of you . Not that much of a risk . Computer gave us a 98 % chance . And the other 2 % ? Then we 'd have died one day before everyone else . Helena , it was all for morale . It proved nothing . The forces inside a black sun are inconceivable . They can bend space and time . Turn both inside out . Then why the force-field ? The same reason prevents you giving up on a patient until he 's dead . I 've got some work to do . It 's getting cold in here . It 's gonna get colder . The black sun 's already drawing our power . Victor believes we could survive . Who knows what Victor truly believes ? - And you ? - Some of us could survive . Those who aren 't on Alpha 24 hours from now . A survival ship , a life boat . I left one Eagle intact . 'All programmed calculations were recorded 'and executed for the force-field test . 'Reprogramming calculations conflicted with previous orders . ' You should have said so , it 's your responsibility . If it takes more power , then say so . Excuse me , Mr Kano . I see your friend 's having difficulty keeping us warm . Computer 's functioning fine . It won 't be functioning at all soon , but you know that , don 't you ? We must use minimum power for heating during your force-field tests . All utilities were on minimum power for the test . The lights , they went back on full power after the test . So did the heating , it 's automatic . Even I know that . The reason the temperature 's still falling is the black sun is draining our power . - We have plenty of power . - But we won 't have . The black sun will see to that . Shut down everything and save it for the force-field . Six hours ? I thought we had 12 ? Six . David said it 's impossible to say how much mass is available to the black sun in this sector . Its gravitational force increases constantly , pulling us in faster than we calculated . We need time to get the survival ship ready . These figures may be the answer . With the force-field activated , we ... We might slow down enough to buy the time . Paul , I want to save power till the last possible moment . It 's either Alpha , sir , or the survival ship . Victor , do you have the test results ? Not yet , but they 're looking fine . Anything wrong ? 'I want to activate the force-field . ' - When ? - ' Right now . ' - I wouldn 't advise it . - ' It can 't wait . 'Get to the main power unit and keep an eye on things . ' Professor , the latest details of the power requirements . Thank you . Call Medical . You 'll be fine . Thank you . Your mechanical heart saved your life . Mm-hmm . - 12 minutes to countdown . - The report from all sections . - Sandra , about Mike ... - Please , Commander . There 's no need to say anything . Tell the Professor to be here for the test . We have under four hours before entering the black sun . Commander , Alpha cannot survive without Computer . Is that a fact ? Attention all personnel , stand by for force-field test . 30 seconds . - Paul , what if it doesn 't work ? - Then our worries are over . - Commander , I must speak with you . - About the test ? - Not really . - Then it has to wait . Kano , essential services program . Computer on minimum capacity . Now , we think for ourselves . 10 seconds . Full power , sir ? Everything we have , Paul . Five seconds , four , three , two , one , zero . A reprieve . Mmm , but for how long ? - Take over , Paul . - Commander , what about Computer ? It remains on minimum capacity . Commander , I gotta talk to you . What 's this about a survival ship ? Is somebody going somewhere ? Somewhere , yes . Did you know about this ? You , Sandra ? I didn 't believe it . Eagle 5 is nearly ready to go and I was not informed . None of us were . I can 't speak for the rest ... but I care about dying , how I die . Staying on Alpha with everybody , I 'd accepted that . Now , there 's going to be six or seven lives on that ship . Six . Well , I should be one of those six , Commander . Because if anyone can get them somewhere ... I can . Are you through , Alan ? Attention all sections Alpha , this is Commander Koenig . Above us again is the force-field , but ahead of us is the black sun . The realistic fact we face now ... is that the force-field only offers us a slim hope that Alpha will survive beyond the next few hours . 'A few of us , however , have a chance to escape the black sun . 'I decided to reserve one Eagle as a survival ship . 'It has been fuelled 'and equipped with supplies to carry six persons . 'Three men and three women . Perhaps this effort will be futile but I believe it must be made . Departure time is 08 : 00 hours , 43 minutes from now . I 've instructed Central Computer to select the people most likely , in every way , to ensure the survival of mankind in space . Here are the six names . The men . Astronaut Alan Carter . Flight Engineer George Osgood . 'Communications Controller Toshiro Fujita . ' The women . Dr Helena Russell . Data Analyst Sandra Benes . 'Professor Angela Robinson . ' This list is final . You knew he wouldn 't go . Nothing I can say will alter the facts . If you 're careful , you have supplies for five weeks . If there 's anything out there that can help you , then together , you 'll find it . If not ... All right , then , that 's it . You lift off in twenty minutes . Commander . No goodbyes , Alan , please . Yes , sir . John . - You 're going . - I 'm not going . - Dr Mathias can replace me . - Like hell he can . That list is final . This isn 't the time for the noble gesture . I 'm not being noble . If anything ... John , it 's my life . If it ends on Alpha or out in space , what difference can it make ? It makes a difference . To me . My figures read less than two hours . Do me a favour , mind the shop . - David . - Oh , thank you . 'Alpha Service section will issue heavy duty clothing 'to Technical section at 0830 hours . 'Medical section will report at 0900 hours . 'Reconnaissance section 0930 hours . 'Engineering section 1000 hours . ' It was thoughtful of you to come , Paul . You didn 't have to . I wanted to . I 'll send you a postcard . - ' Alan , one minute to lift-off . ' - Right . 'This is John Koenig . I know I said no goodbyes but ... 'l wish you all good luck . ' 'Fifteen seconds . Alan ? - ' Good luck . ' - And to you . All of you . 'Attention all stations Alpha . 'Due to the present emergency 'inter-base communication system including Alpha news 'will be suspended until further notice . ' Hey , John . Come on , put this on . Before you catch your death . Very funny . Is that What I think it is ? John , I 've been doing some unique calculations recently . Not about space dynamics or anything like that . Something you can 't learn from books . Victor . No , it 's all right . I 'm just ... rambling on . Wondering a bit . Wondering . Extraordinary thing , how we 've survived . I mean , I put the probability through the computer . I thought it was going to blow up trying to figure the odds . They 're just about infinite . If you 're trying to cheer me up , it 's not working . Anyway , my calculations show that we all should be dead by now . - When the atomic waste ... - What are you doing ? You 're not supposed to smoke . I don 't think Dr Russell would object . Sandra . I will be all right . Sure you will . I remember when I was a little girl , I was afraid of the dark . Isn 't that funny ? And I was afraid of doctors . John , have you ever wondered ... just how and why we 've survived ? - Not until now . - You got any answers ? You 're not referring to God , are you ? Oh , I don 't know . L - | - I 'm a scientist , I don 't know anything about God . No , er ... A sort of ... cosmic intelligence is what I 've got in mind . Which intervenes at the right moment ? It 's one answer . Ultimately , I suppose we ... all believe what we want to believe . Perhaps that 's what reality is . One thing though , the line between science and ... mysticism ... Just a line . Sometimes it makes me feel quite old . Paul . Commander . Central Computer 's deactivated itself . 100 % power is feeding the main generator units ... Paul . Thank you . But there 's nothing more you can do . - You 're relieved . - Very good , sir . Well , I never thought it would end this way . A good man , Paul . 60 year old brandy . I 've been saving it for 10 years . Just waiting for a proper occasion to celebrate . Well , not everybody might think this was a celebration ... but it is to me . If ever there was an occasion ... this is it . To everything that might 've been . To everything that was . Up 50 . Play me . Pass . I raise you 100 , Smitty . You 're bluffing . You 'll never beat me , you know . Paul . Mind if I share the music with you ? Just the thing to keep the cold out . Won 't be long now . Do you know what will happen to us inside the black sun ? Whatever it is , I just hope it 's interesting . Yes , interesting ! Victor , the force-field is holding . So far . I don 't feel cold . I don 't feel anything . Of course , it 's possible that we don 't exist . I exist . I exist , I exist . 'I can hear your thoughts . ' 'Yes . ' 'It 's very beautiful . ' 'l see the theory behind your force-field . ' 'It 's very obvious . ' 'It ties in with a unified field theory of mine . ' 'Oh , yeah ? 'Yes . I see how . ' ' .. so that everything is everything else . ' 'That 's why I said it was beautiful . ' 'If everything is everything else , 'the whole universe is living thought . ' 'That is true . ' - ' Who are you ? ' - ' A friend . Come with me . ' Every star is just a cell in the brain of the universe . 'That is a lovely way to understand it . ' Why have I never talked with you before ? 'Because of time . 'You think at what you call the speed of light . 'In eternity , I have no hurry . 'I think a thought , perhaps , in every thousand of your years . 'You are never there to hear it . ' Are you ... God ? 'It was good to have known you . ' Wait . God . We got through . Your force-field held , Victor . Somehow , we 're on the other side of the universe . Your force-field held ! I wonder how ? No sign of the survival ship , so much for your fancy theories of cosmic intelligence . Well , I knew it was impossible . Was it ? They 're coming back ! Come on ! Commander , come on . I don 't believe it , you must have followed us through . - We went in the opposite direction . - You can 't have . - We did . - We went through it , fantastic ! If you didn 't follow us through , how 'd you find Alpha ? A million light years ! Right across the universe . I 'm an astronaut , Professor . Not a philosopher . Something ... brought us home . Yes . Home .

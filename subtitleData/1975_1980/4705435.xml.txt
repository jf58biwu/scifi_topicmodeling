 Waste of time . Shut up , Lye . Ceremonial duty ... If you don 't shut up , we won 't be guarding a court martial , we 'll be having one . I joined up to see some action . More fool you . - You 've been on campaigns , Par . - I have . - Done a lot of killing . - Enough . More . - It should embarrass her at the very least . - Watch it ! Oh , I hope so , but , uh , she doesn 't embarrass easily , especially not in her own headquarters . - Oh , I meant politically , of course . - Of course . Any attempt to embarrass her personally is an exercise in total futility . Oh , quite . She has all the sensitive delicacy of a plasma bolt . Well ? . Sir , security area , sir . Access is voiceprint linked , sir . I am Secretary Rontane , personal representative of the President . Senator Bercol . Head of the Information Bureau . Ex-officio member of the High Council . Thought he was going to run for it . Pity he didn 't . You could have shot him . A top politico ? . Don 't worry about them . Space Command runs the Federation . Reckon so ? . Know so . And we look after ourselves . Tell that to the prisoner . - Broke the rules , didn 't he ? . - Whose rules ? . Only ones that matter : ours . Blazin ' ' ell , look at this ! Samor , Fleet Warden General , appointed pro tem military arbiter . Old Star Killer . I never thought I 'd see him in the flesh . Hasn 't left his flagship in years . Arbiter in a cruddy court martial . Be by the book . I told you , we look after ourselves . Yes , Samor is a difficult man . Most of the time I 'm more than happy to see him stay with his beloved Galactic Eighth Fleet . On his highly polished flagship . He 's well respected throughout the service . " Old Star Killer " has earned that respect through a lifetime 's devotion to his duty and to his men . A rulebook officer of the old school . Exactly . With him as arbiter a guilty verdict will not be questioned and the matter will be settled . Assuming that is the verdict . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Yes ? . The tribunal is assembling , Supreme Commander . The arbiter is present . Very well . The evidence is straightforward . I can see no reason why we shouldn 't get the verdict we want , in the way that we want it . No , neither can I , Supreme Commander . - And I expect no trouble from the defence . - None . Prisoner and escort , reporting as ordered . Quick march ! - I report for judgment , sir . - Identify yourself . T ravis , Space Commander . Alpha-1 5 1 05 . So recognised . You may stand at ease . Do you accept the authority of the Arbiter , the balance of the judgment program , and the competence of the defending officer ? . I do . Specify the indictment . Space Commander Travis , you are charged under Section Three of the War Crimes Statute Code , Jenkin One , with the murder of one thousand four hundred and seventeen unarmed civilians on the planet Serkasta , Date Code Beta-200 1 . How do you answer the charge ? . I am not guilty . Be seated . Major Thania , does the defence have an opening declaration ? . We reserve our opening declaration , sir . Very well . Enter prosecution data . Prosecution data begins . Identities and death certifications of all victims are entered . - Objection . - Hold . Holding . Defence requests the names of the alleged victims and the cause of death in each case be specified . - All of them ? . - If it pleases the arbiter . Do you realise how long that will take , Major ? . - A man 's life is at stake , sir . - I KNOW what is at stake . My apologies , sir . I meant no disrespect . Since you have at your disposal instant recall of all prosecution data I fail to see what purpose will be served by having the computer intone a catalogue of one thousand corpses . I may wish to challenge elements of that catalogue before they are entered in the judgment program , sir . Playing for time ? . And playing for Servalan . The computer will find T ravis guilty , there 's no doubt of that , but those three are responsible for the sentence . So ? . So , after hearing all the blood-spattered details , they 'll vote for the maximum penalty . Motion sustained . Victims names and causes of death will be specified . Do you think that Travis knows what she 's doing to him ? . A psychotic like Travis ? . Who can tell what he 's thinking ? . Zen , give me stationary orbit , teleport range , somewhere in the temperate zone . Confirmed . Do you require detailed sensor readings ? No . I asked for tolerable conditions . I assume that 's what you 've given me . Confirmed . The gravitational anomalies may affect movement . And uninhabited . The navigation computers list it as such . That 's good enough . Really ? . It sounds a little casual to me . I 'm going down on my own , Avon . It has nothing to do with you . Nothing at all , but it occurs to me that if you should run into trouble , one of your followers , one of your three remaining followers , might have to risk his neck to rescue you . Then you must advise them against that , Avon . Oh , I will . They might even listen to you this time . Why not ? . After all , I don 't get them killed . T rue . Stationary orbit established . Status is firm . All systems are functioning normally . - All right , Zen , you know what to do . - Confirmed . Blake ? . It 's getting worse for him , isn ' t it ? . - Guilt does that . - What would you know about guilt ? . Only what I 've read . Your move , I think . Everything set , Cally ? . Yes . You 've forgotten your gun . What ? . I won 't need it . There 's no one down there . There may be some kind of life form . No , it doesn 't matter . - I will get you a gun . - All right , thank you . Orac . Orac , give it five seconds , then operate the teleport . [ LOCATOR BEACON ] What was all that about ? . I think Orac altered the teleport coordinates . You THINK ? . Well , there 's no way of telling . He zeroed the controls . Our orbit 's shifting . Shifting ? . What do you mean shifting ? . Are we in trouble again ? . Zen ? . New orbit will be established in six minutes , as instructed . Instructed ? . By whom ? . Blake . He 's making sure that we can 't find him . He could be running out on us . Hearing will reconvene at 09 : 00 . Return the prisoner to detention . Prisoner , about turn . Quick march . - One almost has to admire that woman . - What , Thania ? . - Servalan . - Oh . We know that she 's sending T ravis to his death in order to keep his mouth shut , but she is doing it with such an impeccably honest and painstaking tribunal that her real motives can 't even be hinted at . Has a date been set for the Blake inquiry ? . Does it matter ? . Without T ravis ' evidence , the mishandling of the Blake affair becomes a matter of conjecture . The inquiry becomes a formality . A Presidential stay of execution so that T ravis can give evidence ? . After this , he should be more than willing . After this he 'll be a convicted mass murderer . It could still damage Servalan . 'Slime sticks ' , as the old saying has it . Yes , but the President can 't be seen to throw it . - Servalan picked T ravis . - The President picked Servalan . So she 's outmanoeuvred us once again . Let 's say she 's outmanoeuvring us , but it 's not over yet . She could still make a mistake . Which is presumably why we came . I was beginning to wonder . We came , Bercol , because Servalan 's ambitions threaten us all . And the President particularly dislikes being threatened . Shall we dine ? . I wish I 'd known that this was going to drag on so . I 'd have brought my own chef . As I recall , Space Command 's cuisine is appalling . Pathetic ! [ POWER DOWN ] Send her in . Thania . How was the first day ? . - More or less as expected . - So ? . T ravis is behaving oddly . Three years ago , he committed a capital crime . Justice has finally caught up with him . How would you expect him to behave ? . I wouldn 't expect him to sit staring straight-ahead , not moving , not reacting . Not even listening . That 's it . That 's exactly how he was , Supreme Commander . Has someone else remarked on it ? . The Guard Commander 's report mentioned something . It 's almost as though he were drugged . No , of course not . Risk a mistrial ? . Then what ? . You 're representing him . You 'd better find out . I don 't want any doubts about the conduct of this tribunal . Any doubts at all . And Thania , try not to let Travis guess your motives . He 's probably mad , but he certainly isn 't a fool . If he was going to desert us , surely he 'd have chosen somewhere special . Right ! Paradise that is not . Perhaps Blake knows something that we don 't . There aren 't even any people down there . So it has at least one aspect of paradise . Would you maroon yourself on that planet ? . We don 't know that he is marooned . He could have a ship waiting . Oh , come on , Avon . You don 't really believe that . - I wish Gan was here . - Oh , yes , of course . He would be able to work out exactly what was going on . - Maybe he would . - Why do you say that , Vila ? . He was straightforward , wasn 't always expecting to be cheated and double-crossed , not like us . - He trusted people , he trusted Blake completely . - Much good it did him . Welcome back to reality , Jenna . - You think he is double-crossing us , Jenna ? . - I don 't know . But you 're right about one thing ; I 'm not like Gan . I don 't trust unless I 'm trusted in return . - What do you think we should do then ? . - Suggest something . Well now . I find the idea of being wealthy rather appealing . Leave ? . I don 't see much prospect of getting rich around here . It certainly looks as though Blake 's left us , doesn 't it ? . That is the only reasonable assumption that we can make . - So we 've got to look out for ourselves now . - Exactly . - Blake can 't complain really . - Hardly , since he 's not here . No , I mean it 's not as though we haven 't done our share for freedom and all that . More than our share . You two make me sick . Are we going to get out of here or aren 't we ? . Orac , do you know what Blake is doing ? . - Of course I do . - Then tell us . Without the correct data recall code , that information is not available . Data recall code , Avon ? . He 's even put a secret classification code on what he 's doing . Yes , but why did he code it and how ? . Vila , if Gan was here , what would he have asked Orac ? . Something obvious : did Blake leave us any message ? . Thank you . I must confess , I wasn 't sure whether you 'd trust me . or even care enough to ask if there was a message . In your place I 'd probably have just said I don ' t give a damn and cleared off . I think , well , that 's just it , I need time to think . We all do . That 's what all this is about . I must apologise for the somewhat dramaticexit . I had to stop myself coming back . A t least until we 've made some decisions , you and I. I took one hell of a risk with your lives when I went ahead with the attack on Central Control . I thought it was justified , I thought we had a chance to win . And I was wrong . Completely , utterly , stupidly wrong . I noticed that . I almost killed you all . I did kill Gan . For nothing : an empty room , a trick , an illusion . Now I find myself wondering if that 's what it 's been all along : just a dream . I don ' t know any more . I don ' t know whether we should go on , whether you would even supposing I could ask you to . So , that is what we 've got to decide , you and I : where do we go from here ? So that is what we have got to decide , is it ? . I 'm taking a homing beacon down with me . It will start to transmit in thirteen hours . The detectors should be able to locate it and guide the ship to the rendezvous . It 's an automaticbeacon . I shall leave it on the ground when I land and make my way back to it with a hand detector . It seems more fitting somehow . Besides , if either of us chooses not to keep the rendezvous , then we needn ' t think too badly of each other . Maybe the detectors failed . He rea lly ca res a bout us , doesn ' t he ? . - You swallowed that ? . - You think he was faking it ? . Everything but the self-pity . That was real enough . You 're wrong . Jenna ? . Which only leaves one question to be answered . Is it that Blake has a genius for leadership , or merely that you have a genius for being led ? . HEY ! Who is it ? . Do you remember me , sir ? . Par . What are you doing here , T rooper ? . I 'm off duty , sir . Well , I 'm not . I gather you 're tired of your freedom . I 'm a twenty-year man , sir . I wouldn 't recognise freedom if I fell over it . There 's a temporary fault on surveillance . Guard 's a friend of mine . - Stand to attention when you talk to me . - Sir . - I 'm putting you and your friend on report . - Only trying to help , sir . Help ? . And how do you think you can help me , T rooper ? . Brought you something , sir . Open it . That 's good stuff , sir . You won 't go blind drinking that . All right , Par . What have I done to deserve this ? . Sir ? . Faithful trooper , beloved officer , not quite how I see either of us . You always looked after your men , sir . Now you 're gonna die . We thought a drink was the least we could do , sir . Stand at ease . Have one with me . Thank you , sir . That is good stuff . You can go now , Par . - Oh , sir ? . - Par ? . The report , sir ? . No one would believe it . Any more than I do . - Did you give it to him ? . - Yes , Major . - I appreciate it . - With respect , Major , I didn 't do it for you . You served a full tour with Space Commander T ravis , didn 't you ? . - Five years . He was hard . - But fair . No , not often , anyway . But you could always rely on him not to get you killed unnecessarily . He never wasted troopers . Oh , that 's something , I suppose . Major , when you 're up to your neck in slime and lasers , that 's everything . - All right , Par . - Major . T rooper Par ? . Do you think he 's guilty ? . No doubt about it , Major . He gave the order . We just did the shooting . [ SPLASH ] [ SPLASH ] Come in , Thania . I 've been expecting you . I thought you were asleep . What is it you want to ask me ? . - Is there anything you need ? . - You lack subtlety , Major . - What are you suggesting , T ravis ? . - Get out . - Look . - GET OUT ! WHAT are you ? . [ ALIEN CHATTERING ] Well , if that 's your only way of communicating I can 't see us having much of a conversation . Why did you stop ? . Why did you stop ? . Why did you run ? . Movement is life . To stop is to lose yourself and be absorbed . Is it that you are ready to be absorbed ? . Is Oneness already a burden ? . No , I don 't understand what you mean . You are newly hatched . Zil saw you come to Oneness . But your movement was slow . Zil risked Oneness to waken you . What are you ? . My Oneness is Zil . What is yours ? . I 'm called Blake . Come , Blake . Keep distant . Zil and Blake must be alone to live . No , wait . Zil ! The Host stirs . I have already programmed an automatic search pattern for the homing beacon . - You don 't mind if I check it ? . - I 'd be disappointed if you didn 't . What are you doing ? . It 's a detector shield . I 've been working on it for some time . Everyone should have a hobby . What 's it do ? . It should keep us off everything but the Federation 's close range visual scanners . You mean their long-range detectors won 't pick us up at all ? . But that 's brilliant , Avon , absolutely brilliant . It 'll never work . There 's only one way to find out . I 'm sure Blake will find us something suitable to attack . I see . You 've decided to be led like the rest of us . I shall continue to follow . It 's not quite the same thing . - I don 't see the difference . - I didn 't really think that you would . Do you want to tell me why you 've left most of the southern hemisphere off the search pattern ? . I don 't believe that Blake can think and swim at the same time . It 's nothing but ocean down there . Zil , where are you ? . You have stopped again . Is Blake afraid to be alone ? . All must stay alone or wake the Host . You took something from me , something that I need . Now , Zil , what have you done with it ? . Blake will be lost to you unless Zil can explain . But , but how ? . How to explain what Blake is ? . Well , tell me what Zil is . Zil is my Oneness . Alone . Zil is my waking , as Blake is your waking . You mean we live ? . Everything lives . The Host lives . To live is not enough for Blake and Zil . Blake and Zil woke . The waking must not be feared or you will lose it and Blake will be absorbed . To live is not enough ? . To be alone must not be feared . The Host is slow to recognise one who is alone . Though there are many , all stay alone . Do you hunger ? . Do you hunger ? . - What is it ? . - Life . [ RUMBLING ] The Host stirs again . Now Blake , understand the need for swiftness . Information . Detectors indicate rapid changes now occurring on the planetary surface . - Changes ? . - Specify . Indications are that the land mass is sinking . Projections of the rate at which the process is accelerating suggest that it will be entirely submerged beneath the oceans in two hours . - That 's impossible . - Recheck the data . Confirmed . The climatic and gravitational changes would be catastrophic . Well , perhaps they are . The planet would be tearing itself to pieces . Are we sure it isn 't ? . Shouldn 't we move away ? . - How long before the homing beacon activates ? . - One hour , fifteen minutes . Data is confirmed . Analysis continues . Orac , have you got anything on this ? . The phenomenon is unknown to me . I shall require an analysis of the chemical composition of the oceans . Zen ? . Full range chemical analyses are being carried out . - What about Blake ? . - Let 's hope he 's on high ground . There . The Host has not absorbed them . What is the Host ? . And yet you fear it ? . Resist it . Oneness must resist the Host . But you don 't know that it exists . Perhaps you 're imagining it . How do you resist an illusion ? . Eat lightly ; move quickly , so the Host is not aware of your Oneness . Yes , I don 't suppose you know how to speed up the timer on a homing beacon ? . Yeah . Zil , what 's wrong ? . Zil is lost . The Host will take ... Saliva ? . You mean that 's an ocean of spit ? . No , of course not . That was merely an analogy I was drawing . All right , so it 's digestive fluid . What does it mean ? . Surely that 's obvious . This planet is alive . Define alive . All planets are , by some definition . I am not referring to a complex ecosystem . I refer to a single organism . A planetary life form . Fascinating , don ' t you think ? I doubt if Blake does . If it is a single organism , how does it function ? . That would require study . At present I can only conjecture . So conjecture . To maintain life on that scale the organism must have achieved stasis , a perfect balance within itself . Clearly something has upset that balance . - Blake ? . - No . The stimulus would be insufficient . - So , what , then ? . - My conjecture would be parasites A life form living on the organism whose population has reached too high a level . - Well , what 's that organism doing , Orac ? . - Cleansing itself . - Killing them ? . - Correct . And replacing the energy thus expended by eating them . There 's still forty-five minutes before that homing beacon activates . Blake hasn ' t got that long . - Blake must leave Zil . - No . What 's happened to the light ? . The waking time is over . The Host absorbs all . Not yet , it doesn 't . Avon , the flight program 's laid in . - Close to the atmosphere ? . - As close as we dare . All right , stand by . If this works the teleport should operate on a series of brief automatic pulses , each pulse covering a section of the area we are flying across . If Blake is there , it will bring him up ? . Start to bring him up . It will be up to you to hit the main switch and complete the process . You 'll have to concentrate . He 'll appear and disappear in one short flash . And if I miss it ? . He 's gone for good . - This place is fitting . Zil , what ? . Oneness will return when the Host is quiet again . [ ALIEN CHATTERING ] They 're eggs . The children of your people . Their skin is strong . They cannot be absorbed . The teleport materialisation . The field glows white . You thought I was hatching from an egg . You 've been protecting a child . This place is fitting . Here Blake and Zil will surrender Oneness . Zil . Zil ! Not me . I am not ready to surrender ANYTHING ! All right , Jenna . Let 's get on with it . Flight program running . [ RUMBLING ] Flight program will be complete in two minutes . The flight 's almost over . Is it working ? . Quiet , Vila . Now ! Thank you . Next time I want to think , I 'll do it in my cabin . I should stick to action , Blake . That 's what you 're good at . Jenna , we 've got him back . Avon adapted the teleport with his usual skill , probably ruined it . You went to a lot of trouble . One of these days they are going to leave you . They were almost ready to do so this time . Yes , I thought they might be . - You handle them very skilfully . - Do I ? . - But one more death will do it . - Then you 'd better be very careful . It would be ironic if it were yours . Prosecution data is now entered as complete . Judgment program Jenkin 1 Oblique 3 holding . Major Thania , is your defence data prepared and ready to be entered ? . If it pleases the arbiter , we would like to offer our opening declaration . - Very well . - Thank you , sir Gentlemen , it is with a very real sense of waste , perhaps even of tragedy . NO ! Has the prisoner some objection ? . - I request a consultation , with the Arbiter 's permission ... - Warden Samor , I have no wish to consult with my defence . That 's enough ! I will not have this tribunal reduced to the level of a common trooper 's brawl . You have already made formal acceptance of the competence of the defending officer ? . Yes , sir ! - Defence may consult . - Thank you , sir . What the hell do you think you 're doing , T ravis ? . You handled that badly , Thania . The Supreme Commander will not be pleased . - Signs of life ? . - Death throes , nothing more . - All right , what is it you want ? . - The opening declaration . You want to know what I am going to say ? . I 'm going to say that you were a brilliant and dedicated soldier who had a lapse of judgment , - a momentary aberration . - Only a momentary aberration ? . I 'm further going to say that you deeply regret what happened . In other words , I am going to lay the basis of your defence . - I will make the opening declaration . - Look , don 't be a fool Do you really think you 're going to impress them sympathetically ? . I think the Supreme Commander wants me to go to my death quietly . - That is as close to quietly as I am going to get . - Look ; I 'm trying to save your life , Travis . You 'd be better occupied trying to save your own , Thania . Majors can die quite anonymously . And your involvement in this fiasco , makes your life expectancy only slightly longer than my own . We were getting a reputation for being invulnerable . - We were even beginning to believe it ourselves . - Some of us , anyway . All right , yes , I admit it . Gan 's death woke me , made me realise that I 'd come to accept our own legend . But far more important than that , every Federation trooper , every kill-happy bounty hunter now knows that we are fallible . You 're saying that it 's time to stop . That is what you 're saying , I hope . No , he 's saying it 's too late to stop , aren 't you ? . We 've come too far . No , what I 'm saying is there will be a better time . - When we have restored our legend . - Ah . All right , what death defying feat must we undertake in order to do that ? . - Will this detector shield work ? . - Yes . A high-speed attack . A single strike run . We 'll be on them before they know and away before they can respond . - Where ? . - Servalan 's headquarters . You may begin . A field officer , like myself , is frequently required to make fast , unconsidered decisions . You were all field officers ; you know that 's true . Time to think is a luxury battle seldom affords you . You react instinctively . Your actions , your decisions , all instinct , nothing more . But , an officer 's instincts are the product of his training . The more thorough the training , the more predictable the instinct , the better the officer . And I am a good officer . I have been in the service all my adult life . I 'm totally dedicated to my duty and highly trained in how to perform it . On Serkasta , I reacted as I was trained to react . I was an instrument of the service . So if I 'm guilty of murder , of mass murder , then so are all of you ! The prisoner will be seated . Is the defence data prepared ? . - It is , sir . - Enter it . Judgment program Jenkin 1 Oblique 3 running . Defence data commences . - Speed ? . - Standard by Eight . Flight time to target ? . Six hours and four minutes at present speed . - Increase speed to Standard by Ten . - Standard by Ten . - Can we rely on it ? . - I thought we were . Detector contact , extreme range Grid Five . Six ships . Standard Federation patrol pattern . - Bearing One Nine Four . - Have they picked us up yet ? . - Maintaining patrol pattern . - Holding One Nine Four . Put them on the screen , Zen . They missed us ! Avon 's gadget works ! I never doubted it for a moment . Is something wrong ? . It just occurred to me , that as the description of a highly sophisticated technological achievement , " Avon 's gadget works " , seems to lack a certain style . The prisoner will stand . Run judgment . Judgment program 1 oblique 3 . Conclusion : Space Commander Travis , you are guilty as charged . The tribunal will retire to consider sentence . No surprise from the defence . - How did you know ? . - How did you NOT know ? . - I thought he 'd given up . - I warned you not to underestimate T ravis . I don 't think he 's persuaded them . I was watching Samor . What Travis said bothered him ! You were watching ? . Secret session or not , did you seriously imagine I wouldn 't have a spy camera in there ? . Travis knew , right from the beginning . It really is a pity he 's got to die . He 's so much better than anything I 've got left . Time to target ? . Fourteen minutes . Attack run will commence in 9 minutes and 30 seconds . - How long before they see us ? . - Nine minutes and twenty-five seconds . Space Commander , we have considered your sentence at some length . Your contention that what happened on Serkasta was a direct result of your training concerned us greatly . We accept that you are trained to kill . As are we all . What we cannot accept is that this training leads inevitably to the murder of innocents . Your behaviour was not that of a Federation officer , but rather that of a savage , unthinking animal . Target now registering on all detectors . Three minutes to commencement of attack run . We cannot find it in our hearts to absolve you in any way of the responsibility for these murders . The sentence of this tribunal is , therefore , that you should be stripped of all rank and privileges , that you be dishonourably dismissed the service , and that you then be executed for the common criminal you have shown yourself to be . Have you anything to say ? . - Five seconds to attack run threshold . - Commit . We are now in their visual range . Attack run commenced . - Stand by the main blasters . - Main blasters ready . Do I take it you have nothing to say ? . The Federation is run by hypocrites and supported by fools . I 'm glad to be rid of you all . Public Address : All personnel to battle stations . Unidentified ship on attack run in quadrant six . Fire the main blasters ! [ NEUTRON BLASTERS ] Public Address : Automaticairlock will trigger in three seconds . [ GUNFIRE ] - Don ' t make me kill you , Par . - What happened in there ? . Outer wall cracked , automatic airlock sealed the chamber . They 'll all be dead by now . Drop the gun . I can 't do that , sir . Don 't be a fool . I 've got nothing to lose anymore . I can 't let you go , sir . Some of us weren 't hypocrites , were we , Par ? . Get us out of here , Jenna . Speed Standard by Twelve . Speed Standard by Twelve . Battle computers , put force wall on standby . Single attack run on Quadrant Six . Damage is extensive but confined to that section as far as we can tell . - Damage control teams ? . - Moving in now . - What about casualties ? . - High and rising all the time . No estimates yet , Supreme Commander . Very well . Keep me informed . Well ! Savage , THINKING animals have a way of surviving , don 't they ? . - Who was it ? . - We think it was Blake . I must remember to say thank you before I kill him . - What are you planning to do ? . - I 'm planning to leave . You 're going to give me a pursuit ship , oh , and the trigger circuit for this . You think so ? . And you 'll hunt Blake . While you hunt both of us . Now give the orders . Carefully . Is Pursuit Four ready for immediate launch ? . Yes , ma 'am . And your crew is standing by . Have the crew stand down . I want them replaced by three mutoids . - Mutoids ? - Yes , mutoids And have them blanked . I want their minds imprinted to receive orders only from the person who first uses the trigger word " outlaw " to them . Yes , ma 'am . You 'll need a crew you can rely on . Still one step ahead ? . You 're not going to use me any more . Move ! The last patrol is off the detectors . We have lost them all . " Resist the Host or your Oneness will be absorbed " . I would quite like to have met this Zil of yours . It 's not often that one comes across a philosophical flea . That 's the stuff that legends are made of . Then again , perhaps they are not that uncommon .

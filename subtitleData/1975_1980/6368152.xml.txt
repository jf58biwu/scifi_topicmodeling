 ( INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING ) FALK : After the disasters , it was as if life itself , it already stopped . Everything burned . Afterwards , nothing seemed to grow again . Nothing . The cities died . People looted them and ran to the sea . But the seas had died too . Empty ... And then , it rained again . But the land and the people were still barren . People died of hunger and disease , and hopelessness . And the strong ones began killing the weak ones for scraps of food . Those who could , flocked together in tribes and hid in caves and secret places . And others became like wolves , hunting and killing anything that moved . They were ravagers . ( GUNSHOT ) Falk ! Oh ! Miriam . Miriam . Mmm . I heard a gunshot . Did you see Ravagers ? Falk ? Well , I heard ... I ... Thought I heard something . But it was in the hills . Probably some scouts . Come on .

We 've always managed to keep ahead of them before . I was just beginning to feel safe here . Yeah . Well , that 's when you start going careless . Falk , can we go back to that place on the beach ? Beach ? Why ? Maybe the fish would come back . Oh ! I told you , please , it 's no use . The seas are poisoned . They 're poisoned . There has to be somewhere . Must be somewhere .

MAN 2 : Pass me the bread . Ever think you 'd see anything like this , Falk ? Not ever . ( CHUCKLES ) Never . And I 've seen a Flocker 's camp before . We 're not Flocker 's here . ( SILENCE ) I guess I spoke out of turn . Yes , you did . I 'll accept your apology . You did apologize ? Oh , yes.Oh , yes . Sure . - I 'm sorry. - ( CONVERSATIONS RESUME ) How come you 've seen so many Flocker camps , Falk ? Huh ? What does it matter ? I mean , maybe you 're not Flockers and you should think you 're better off than them , and in some respects you are . You see , what , what I mean is , there 's no real difference . They hide . And you hide . They 're afraid of strangers , you 're afraid of strangers . Hold on , Falk . You 're getting out of line . Hold it , hold it , hold it . Now let him saywhat he thinks . Um , if you had todecide for us , what would you do ? Speak up . We 're interested in your opinion . Well ... ( SCOFFS ) It seems to me that hiding in fear is not the answer . There may be something better out there . But you 'll never know it . Not if you stay here , locked and caged up , just waitingfor everything to end . You 've , uh , you 've got to take a chance . And gamble awayall our lives , in the hope that there 's something better out there ? ( PEOPLE LAUGHING ) Why ? We have everything we need right here . - ( ALL AGREEING ) - MAN : Yeah , we sure do . Except hope . ( LAUGHING ) Well , now ... Well , look around you , Falk . Isn 't this better than ... Huh . ( SOFTLY ) It can 't be . ( SNIFFING ) It ... It 's real . MAN : Caught this morning . We get ' em right here.In the channel . The fish , yeah , returned . They 're showing upmore and more . Maybe it 's a sign . Damn it , Hank , that 's enough ! Now , once and for all , I say the land is finished . Maybe not , Rann ! Now look , maybe not . If the fishhave come back , that means the seas are not poisoned . So why can 't the land come back ? Look , when I was in a Flocker 's camp , I met an old man . He gave me an apple . He gave me two apples . Two . New , ripe apples . Doesn 't that mean something to you people ? Well , doesn 't it ? Somewhere things are beginning to grow again . Maybe children . Children are beginning to ... To ... To be born once more . Can 't you see that ? Well , can 't you ? It 's settled . Nobody leaves this ship . You mean that I am a prisoner here , too ? Prisoner ? Huh . You can do anything you want . As long as it doesn 't jeopardize the rest of us . Well , I can live by anything then . That makes sense . Good . Good , I 'm glad to hear it . Because our rulesmake a lot of sense.Hmm ? - ( ALL AGREEING ) - Right ? Oh , by the way , are you with him ? - No . - Yes . No . - Yes.- ( FORCED LAUGH ) No , she 's not . MAN : She doesn 't know . There seems to be a difference of opinion .

We want to talk to you . ( PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) What ? We want to know about Genesis . Where is it ? I don 't know . I thought this was it . But I was wrong . Come on , you can trust us . You heard what the man said . He 'll never let you leave this ship . ( CHUCKLES WRYLY ) What if he can 't stop us ? We 've got others . Will you lead us ? ( GRUNTS ) ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) Admiral , it was amazing . They had me . I mean , they really had me . Then the stupidbastards cut meloose up there . - They cut you loose ? - ( ALARM BUZZING ) - Ravagers ! - ( ALL SCREAMING ) Let 's go , let 's go , come on ! Follow me to the Armory .

 25.000 Check . Right , one more time . Cut primaries , reverse thrust . Check . Stabilise and trim back to stationary . Check . Negative anti gravs . Compensate for orbital drift and hold . Hold . All confirmed . Good . Right Let 's check with the expert . Zen , report status . Liberator is stationary and is stabilised in an anti orbital posture . - Whatever that means . - It means we got it right . - Together we can fly this ship manually . - I think we make a good team . - Well , hurray for us . What 's eating you now ? I 'm just wondering how long we 're going to live to enjoy our newfound skills . Zen , three sixty degree survey . Put etheric detector beams on maximum . Report any space vehicles within range . Vila , put visual survey on the screen . Negative on all systems . There are no space vehicles within detector range . - We 've lost them . - So much for Federation pursuit ships . - At least we know we can outrun them . - Outrun them ? In this we can out stroll them . Don 't get too relaxed about it . They 'll keep on coming . We have the whole universe to hide in . Except that we 're not going to hide . Very soon now the Federation ships will know exactly where we are . Or at least where we 've been . - I don 't follow you . - Oh , but you do . And that 's the problem . Up until now we 've only been a minor irritation to the Federation . I think it 's about time we hurt them . I don 't like the sound of that . Neither do I. I thought it was agreed we wouldn 't do anything without discussing it thoroughly . True . It was also agreed that anybody could opt out at any time . Just tell me when you want to leave . Oh , I will . But in the meantime , I think we have a right to know what it is you 're planning . Zen , set a course for Saurian Major , speed standard by two . Speed and course confirmed . That falls a little short of my idea of a thorough discussion . We can talk and travel . We 're safer on the move . Another one who 's prepared to let Blake do his thinking for him . Enough , Avon . Saurian Major ? Zen , visual star sector 42 point 61 . It 's there , on the edge of the system . One of the early self governing colonies subsequently annexed by the Federation . Half the population were butchered . The other half were rounded up and transported to frontier planets . A few managed to escape to the hills and form guerrilla bands . Why are we going there ? I mean , I feel for them , but we 've got problems of our own . They 've built a vast transceiver complex there . All Federation signals and navigation controls are beamed into Saurian Major , boosted and redirected . It 's a vital nerve centre in the Federation space control system . Destroy that , and you blind , deafen and silence them . That 's what we 're going to do . A blow for freedom . Yes , our freedom . For a clever man you 're not very bright . Deaf , dumb and blind how are they going to catch us ? I 'm sure Blake will manage it somehow . Blake ? Hmm ? Are there any artificial satellites on our course ? I don 't know , I 'll check . None to be seen . Are you getting something ? Yes , something . How long has it been registering ? Couple of minutes . Signal 's getting stronger . Zen , visual detector scan and computer analysis on grid one , one five , please . The signal is mechanical . It emanates from a space projectile of unidentified origin . Translator units categories the signal as a distress call . Estimate the projectile 's speed and course . No indication of motive power . The projectile 's movement is only subject to space drift and orbital influence . If they 've lost power , they 're in real trouble . We don 't have much option then , do we ? How far away are they ? One million seventy three thousand spacials and closing . Re-program course and speed to rendezvous with the projectile . Lock off on 100 spacials . Speed and course confirmed . - You 'd better tell the others . - All right . Problem ? Putting out a false distress signal . It 's a trick used by space pirates . - Well then , we 'll have to be careful . - I 'll get the others . There 's nothing coming back except the same distress call . It must be on a mechanical repeater . Do you recognize the type ? No . Primitive . Too small to sustain a full life support system by the look of it . Doesn 't seem to be any heavy armament . Could be a high speed transporter . - To transport what ? - Do we care ? Getting nervous ? No , I 've been nervous all along . I do not like the look of that thing . Zen , have the sensors picked up any sign of life ? No information can be given . That is not what I asked . I want to teleport across there . There is room . And life support ? There is life support for a limited period . I 'll go and take a look then . I 'll come with you . Avon . It is in in in ... I 'll have to overhaul that thing ... sane . - I wonder . It 's almost as if Zen has a limiter . - A limiter ? Something that stops him from helping us too much . Or maybe it 's someone who stops him . Gan , if you 're trying to scare me , you 're succeeding . Let 's see just how precise you can be . Are you sure you can trust me ? For as long as we 're useful to each other . We 'll keep the voice channels open . All set ? - Ready . - Sure ? - As I 'll ever be . All right ? Right . Put us across . - More by luck than judgment . - Ah , don 't tell him that . Thank you , Avon . You ever seen anything like this before ? No . Well ? Controls are very basic . Just enough instruments to make a safe landing . Everything 's manual . Why put manual controls in an unmanned craft ? What 's that ? Distress relay . Probably cuts in automatically when a major fault develops . Ah , here it is . What ? The fault . Circuit tracer . There 's a malfunction reading on the auto navs . That 's what must have activated the cut-outs on the propulsion units . Well , that explains why they 're drifting . But you don 't put circuit tracers in an unmanned craft . There must have been a crew on board . Well , the locks on the inner hatch are still secure . What about this one here ? It 's locked . So if there was a crew . They 're still here . Blake , look ! Look at his eyes . He 's alive . What is it ? It 's cold , it almost took the skin off my fingers . This is the same process they used centuries ago on the early deep space flights . They subjected their crew to extremely low temperatures to suspend the aging process . This is a cryogenic capsule . There 's not much we can do for them here . Re animation will be a slow process . We can 't just leave them here . We 'll worry about that when we get back . Our air is running out , in case you hadn 't noticed . I hadn 't wanted to worry you . - Avon , do you read ? - I hear you . Bring us back . - Bring us back . - I can 't The teleport control is burnt out . - What did you do ? - Not a thing . It blew all by itself . - Can you repair it ? - No need . There is an automatic repair system and it 's working . How long ? - I don 't know . - Why not ? . Zen won 't tell us . - Our air is running out . - Yes , I was afraid of that How long ? Minutes . Get Zen to manoeuvre the ship ' round and bring the entire projectile on board . I 'd already thought of that . Zen refuses to do it . Then you 'll have to . - That 's very chancy , Blake . If Liberator so much as nudges that ship . - Then you 'd better get it right . Shall we get on with it ? Why didn 't Zen warn us ? I think he tried to . I 'm sorry . I 'm all right . Lock the inner hatches , positive pressure . Locked . Equalise the lower hold pressure . Equalised . Open the main locks . Visual . Ramp fully open . Good . Moving to line up . Right lateral , minimum power . Too much . You 're overshooting . Left lateral . That 's enough . Hold . Square on . Give me a fall line projection . Good . We 're aligned and we 're ready to go . Do you two know what you have to do ? Uh huh . I hope so . Commencing docking procedure now . He 's taking his time . It 's a delicate manoeuvre . He 'll get there . I 'm breathless with anticipation . That 's very good . Gently . Easy . Easy . Good . Alignment is exact . She 's turning . - Right lateral . - Quickly . - She 's drifting under the laser projection . - Down degree point zero one . You 're too close . She 's going to hit the ramp broad side on . Get around . Down another point . More lateral . You 're too close . Pull away , Avon . No time . She 's coming ' round Gan , when the tail is on the laser projection , I 'll go straight in . NOW ! You 've done it . You 've done it ! Close the main locks . Zen , transfer to inner hold number five . Transfer process commenced . - Hull repressurised . - Inner hatches released . Switch the visual . Very delicate . You know , with hands like that and a decent upbringing , he might have made a respectable pickpocket . Yes . We 'd better go down and check that they 're all right . Keep a watch , Gan . There you are , you see . Nothing to worry about . What have we here ? Take a look . - Thank you . - Glad to be of help . You don 't sound too sure about that . Thanks anyway . Nice flying . Gan . - Blake . See if Zen 's back on our side yet . - I don 't think he ever left it . Tell him to resume course for Saurian Major , speed standard by two . Understood . Anything ? Most of it 's been scraped away . Must have been in space a long time . I wonder where it came from . More interesting is where it was going and why . Let 's see if Avon 's got any ideas . - What do you think ? - It 's an old ship . Or from a technologically backward culture . Sub light drive . So obviously the destination was outside the star system from which it was launched . Obviously . Why ? They wouldn 't bother to put the crew into suspended animation unless the journey was likely to last longer than the natural life span of a man . The cryogenic system halts the aging and the decay . These two are probably hundreds of years old . Is there any idea of where they were going and why ? No , but they weren 't planning on coming back . All the instruments are set for landing . There 's nothing for take off . There 'd be no point in going back . The world they left would be dead years ago . No sign of any weapons . In fact there isn 't much equipment at all . Either they were headed for a civilised destination where they expected a friendly reception or we are missing the point entirely . It all seems a bit single-minded to me . I 've cut in the re-animation unit . It 'll take a little while , but these two should come out of it and be able to tell us what it 's all about . - Can we speed it up ? - Interfere with the program and you could kill them . Well , there 's no point in waiting around . We 'll take a look at them in a couple of hours . Oh , wait a minute . There is something we could do . We could take out the program in the auto navigational unit , link it into our own computers . and take a reading on planet of origin , the course and the destination . It 's worth a try . How are you getting on with that ? The decoders are still working out the notational system . It 's taking longer than I thought . Has anyone been down to see our guests lately ? - Vila went down a little while ago . - And ? Thawing nicely . Couple of hours , we should be able to talk to them . Liberator is now in stationary orbit 1,000 spacials from the surface of the planet Saurian Major . Then it 's time we went . Vila , I shall want you down there with me . Oh . Right . Bring your bag of tricks . Avon ? Isn 't he enough ? Their detectors are concentrated on neutral space . We came in from Federation territory . They won 't have spotted us yet . But they will , and I can do what needs to be done faster with your help . No doubt . Jenna will teleport us down . Put Zen on constant scan I want to know immediately if those Federation ships come into this system . Of course . Gan , help Jenna keep an eye on those aliens . One of you must be on standby at all times . We may have to get off Saurian quickly . Don 't worry . How long are you going to stay down there ? Depends on what we find Saurian day is about . 36 hours that should be all we need . Are you ready ? Right . Put us down . Eeurgh ! - Did it sting you ? - It 's warm Clammy . A bit like flesh . You have to be careful of the planet life around here . Some of it 's carnivorous . Some species even have an intelligence rating . Well that 's a comfort . I should hate to be eaten by something stupid . - Look . This is the communications complex . This is where we are . - Looks like a long trek . How do you intend to make contact with the rebels ? If they 're any good , they 'll make contact with us . We won 't make any secret of our presence . Just set up camp and wait . And if the security forces get to us first ? They won 't patrol this far from the complex . A small fire first , I think . No sign of pursuit ships yet . Oh , they 'll find us . Sooner or later . - And then we 'll fight . - Yes . I keep wondering whether it wouldn 't be better to opt out of all this . Find a safe planet . Hide . - They 'd still find you . - I suppose . But if you wanted to leave , you know Blake wouldn 't try to stop you . No , I know . What about you ? Are going to stick with him ? I have to . I want to stay alive . And to do that I need people I can rely on . I can 't be on my own . What do you mean ? I killed a security guard . They said it was murder . But he had a gun I was unarmed . You see , he killed my woman . That must have been terrible . I 'm sorry , my head aches . I 'll be all right in a little while . I suppose I should go and look at our frozen friends . - Relax , I 'll go . - Thanks . Surely we left these open . I know you 're here . We 're not going to harm you . There 's no need to hide . Can you understand me , we 're not going to harm you . Gan , one of them . Gan where are you ? What 's happened ? What 's the matter ? Gan , one of them attacked me I tried talking to him but I couldn 't make him understand . It 's all right , you 're safe now . Where is he ? In the hold I 've locked the door . He threw something at me . He practically broke my arm . Let 's take a look at it , eh ? I tried to get you on the communicator , but he 'd smashed it . Then he rushed me . He 's probably frightened . No , he didn 't look frightened . He just looked murderous . Could be . He 's been asleep for centuries , then wakes up in a strange place not knowing what 's happening . Or why . He could be confused , I suppose . We have no idea what mental damage can be done by long term cryogenic suspension . That 's amazing . Thank you . You stay here . I 'll go and sort him out . Gan ? Be careful . [ COMMUNICATOR CHIME ] Jenna . Blake . We haven 't made contact with the rebels yet . We 're moving . Reference 3340 . I 'll call in again when we get there . Right . Anything happen with the crew of the projectile ? One of them ... They 're recovering . Everything 's under control . Good . I 'll check with you later . Blake . Either of you found anything yet ? Not a thing . Several plants with designs on my body . Apart from them , there 's nothing else in sight . All right , come on down . We 'll try somewhere else . Who are you ? Will you answer my question ? Who are you ? I ask you for the last time , who are you ? Do you mind if I get up ? Try that again and I 'll blow your head off . Now what are you doing here ? My name is Blake I 'm trying to make contact with the resistance group . How did you get here ? We came from ... May you die alone and silent . You can talk then . You may be telepathic but you certainly can 't read minds or you wouldn 't have fallen for that . I will tell you nothing . I 'm not with the Federation security force . I do not need to read minds to know that you lie . I came here with two of my crew a few hours ago . I keep a check on the landing area . Nothing has come in or gone out . I 'm hardly likely to use the landing area am I ? I need to contact the resistance fighters . Your words are meaningless to me . We 're here to destroy the communication centre . Your people have information that would help . Oh , it is quite clear that you seek information . I 'll make contact some other way . Take it . We 'll manage without you . Can you prove what you say ? If I can get inside that centre , I 'll prove it with the biggest explosion you 've ever seen . I might be able to help you . Perhaps . Well , make up your mind . I 've got no more time to play games . What is it you want to know ? Let 's start with who you are . Cally . My name is Cally . Out . No need for belligerence , pretty lady . I 'm harmless . Quick , isn 't she ? - Is he one of your crew ? - One of them . And he 's useless as he said . I 've had a gun on you the whole time . You were dead as soon as you broke cover . " Harmless " was the word I used . You couldn 't even get that right . How do you come to be telepathic ? I am from the planet Auron . I was sent from there to aid the freedom fighters of this planet . But my people are the Auronar . And they are telepathic And quick . I would not have died alone . Why can 't you read our minds ? Because you are not telepathic . Could I read yours ? You could receive my thought if I wished you to . Cally , how do we contact the resistance force ? There is no resistance force . They 're all dead . All of them ? We were getting stronger . The security forces kept hunting us , but we knew the hills and jungles too well . We made an attack on the main generating plant . And for the first time , they saw us a real threat . What happened ? They released poison from the sky . All the fighters died , except me . Perhaps because I am alien to this planet . You 've been working alone ever since . My work was in communications . But there will be companions for my death . I plan to raid the complex . To destroy until I am destroyed . Well , our aim 's the same . But I wasn 't planning a suicide mission . I should hope not . He fears death ? I plan to live forever . Or die trying . If you can get us inside that complex , we 'll provide all the destruction you want . And still get out safely . Or die trying . I will guide you . She said yes . Gan , are you all right ? Gan , respond please . Report your location . Report your location . Gan , where are you ? Gan ? Gan ? [ THUD ] [ LASER BLAST ] What happened ? Jenna . Couldn 't stop them . Couldn 't stop them . Implant . What ? Limiter . Not possible for me to kill now . Gan , what happened in the projectile ? Never wanted to . They kill . Anyone , everyone who isn 't theirs . One of them is already dead . The other one . I saw his face Jenna . Despises us . It 's clear . This is it . The control room for the paraneutronic generator . If we can sabotage the limiter settings , the chain reaction will blow this entire complex off the planet . We 'll need to blast the door . That will alert the guards before we 've even started . Listen fingers , computers are yours , doors are mine . Right ? You can open it ? One side , please . There you are . Good , Vila . Very good . It was almost nothing . Everybody inside . Come on , quick . [ ALARM ] Vila . - Avon , can you do it ? - Five minutes . I know . " Make it two " . [ LASER BLAST ] It 's all right . We got them . Everything 's over . Adjuster . - The door won 't hold much longer . - I 'm nearly finished . Magnetic probe . That 's running up into the danger level ! I have to neutralise the safety circuits . Otherwise , it will close down the reactor . [ LASER BLASTS ] Put this on . What is it ? Our way out . Put it on . Gan , the aliens have linked their ship to our power source I 'm getting a very heavy power loss . I 'll have to disconnect . You 'll be all right , won 't you ? Yes . Olag Gan . Basic decoding of projectile 's auto log is now complete . Occupants are identified as programmed guardians . They are conditioned to eliminate any life form , which could be a threat to the brood units and genetic banks contained in the rear section of the projectile . Liberator crew are such a threat and will be attacked . There are four guardians Repeat , four guardians . JENNA ! [ LASER BLASTS ] Got it . Reaction 's building . Nothing can stop this generator now . Jenna , we 're ready . Stand by to bring us up . Control ? Control , now ! Jenna ? Gan ? Teleport NOW ! Can you hear me ? It 's going . It 's going up . Teleport now . [ TELEPORT WHINE ] [ INCREASING WHINE OF REACTOR ] [ EXPLOSION ] [ TELEPORT WHINE ] Where 's Jenna ? Jenna . In the hold . Look after him . Jenna ! [ ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE ] That should give them problems for a while . You have my thanks . Pleasure . Do you wish to return to Auron ? I cannot return to my people . I have failed . Then stay with us . Thank you . What are we going to do about the projectile ? - Dump it in deep space . - Thanks a lot . I don 't like the sound of that . It 's murder . Would you rather it was hooked back into the power system ? You heard Zen . A single cell from those genetic banks can be incubated into fully grown adult in 16 minutes . We could be up to our armpits in homicidal maniacs within the hour . Maybe that 's why Zen was so uncooperative . I think it should have taught us something about the wisdom involved in bringing aliens aboard . - Seven of us can run this ship properly . - Six surely ? - You forgot Zen . You 're not counting that machine as a member of the crew ? Ooh ! What do you say to that Zen ? Please state course and speed . Very diplomatic . Set a course for Centero , speed standard by two . Confirmed .

[ Poignant instrumental music ] [ Poignant music continues ] [ Excited laughter and shouting ] [ Imitates Tarzan 's jungle cry ] [ Jessie cheers ] I 've never been able to say things to you , Jess , about how I feel .

And he always kept them real shiny . He was tall , and he used to take long strides . And there I 'd be right alongside him just trying to keep up with him . I don 't think he ever knew how proud I felt of him . Or how good it felt just to be there alongside him . Even now , when I think back on it , I still feel ... The thing is , Jess I couldn 't tell him about it then , but I can tell you about it now . I don 't wanna wait ten years to tell you how I 'm feeling about you right now .

Sure , there 's a shop just down the beach . They 'll appreciate the business . Sure , thanks . You just trucking around ? Good time for just trucking . Wish I could do a bit myself .

What 's the matter with you ? What you got there , pal ? [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Jessie screams ] Yeah , that 's the way I see it , too . Sure . It 's been nice talking to you . ' Bye . MAX : Take it you agreed with him . They don 't worry , I 'm not worried . What about that ? I figure it 's lost property . If no one makes a claim to it , I say we can forget it . Sounds okay to me , Jess . Don 't know . ZIGGY : If Ziggy says so , believe me , it 's okay . ZIGGY : Now , May 's expecting you up at the farm . ZIGGY : You 'll have no more trouble up there . Just green grass and fat cows . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] JESSIE : How are you doing ? MAX : I 'm getting there . I reckon you ought to connect the doohickey to the gizmo . Come here , you . You touch me with those hands and I 'll rip you apart . No ! May told me about the little beach down by the trees . Do you want to come ? Love to except that I 've gotta fix the fan belt , or we 're never gonna get outta here . Okay , Tarzan , I 'll bring you back some bananas . Hey ! MAY : If you meet Benno down there , don 't let him bother you . MAY : He 's only a baby . Sure , May . [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Suspenseful music intensifies ] [ Men howl ] [ Jessie yelps ] [ Screams ] Calm down , now , and tell me what 's the matter . Very , very naughty . Now , you tell May what you ... MAX : May , you go and call Ziggy . Call Ziggy and tell him to get here as fast as he can . Why ? What 's going on ?

Jessie Jessie , Jessie you 've not got a sense of humor . You 've got a pretty face , though . Awful pretty . TOECUTTER : I suppose you don 't need a sense of humor with a pretty face . The only trouble is though , missy if you should lose the face ... Please , don 't hurt my baby . ... you 've got nothing ! What do you want from me ? TOECUTTER : Don 't change the subject . MAY : Hold it ! Right there ! [ Affected gasp ] - I hate guns . - Old lady . Stand back ! MAY : Stay back ! BUBBA : Woman ! Stay back ! [ Gunshot ] Anyone so much as breathes I 'll cream ' em !

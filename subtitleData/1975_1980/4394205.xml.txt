 Greville , isn 't it a little late to send flowers ? I think you should use them , Miss Emma , they 'd be very hurt otherwise . Roses ... The roses were always so much nicer then . Never mind the roses , the guests will be arriving shortly . These have just arrived , sir . The house was always full of perfect roses . Oh , please come on , Emma ! Everything seemed more perfect then , didn 't it , dear ? It should be perfect now , it 's cost me enough . - It was your idea , Arthur . - That 's right . Now that I 've gone to all this expense we 'll go along with it . - Don 't make any faux pas , Emma . - No , Arthur . I 'll try not to . - Remember the date and the year . - Yes , such a lovely day . And such an exciting year . June the 21st , 1930 . - Yes dear . - Good . Greville , did you ? - Yes , sir . - Hm . I imagine Wall Street and the Stock Exchange would say it was a little too damn exciting . - The Stock Exchange , damn . - What is it , Arthur ? I didn 't get yesterday 's prices on the Tokyo market . Oh , dear . I don 't care what he says I can actually hear that thing . - Ultrasonics , Miss Emma . - I don 't care what they call it , I can hear it . - Good evening , sir . - Evening , Miss Shaw . - You all right ? - Yes , sir . That 's good . What did Tokyo close at ? - 2.5 up , my lord . As you predicted . - Good . Hong Kong ? Point six on Mullrine International and point four on Engineering . Splendid ! You spoke to Fairfax ? Yes , he managed to knock Lauderdale down to eight million dollars US . I won 't go to a cent more . - I told him that . - Good . And what do you think of the outfit , eh ? - Exactly right , sir . - Should be ! Tailor charged me 400 quid for it ! Not a single trace of synthetic fibre in the whole suit . - Got him to guarantee that . - Authentic through and through . If it 's worth doing it 's worth doing thoroughly . By the way , you 're not to come out of this door under any circumstances . You understand ? Any circumstances - it would spoil the whole effect . - Your clothes ... - I understand , sir . If you want to go out , use this door . No one must see you . I intended to work this weekend anyway , sir . Good . You don 't have to go through to your bedroom in the annexe ? - No , sir . - All right , then , see you Monday . I hope you have a super party , sir . It 'll be different . Have to mark our 50th year of operation , don 't we ? Seems as good a way as any . 21st of June . Summer Solstice . I remember noting it then . Ahh , the cocktails . Good man , Greville . Splendid chap . Yes , Arthur , you look very handsome . Ah , the first guests . Yes , now it all begins . How silly of me , I feel quite nervous . Yes , how silly of you , Emma . Well , couldn 't get back here if he wanted to , silly old devil . 'All irregularities will be handled 'by the forces controlling each dimension . 'Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life . 'Medium atomic weights are available . 'Gold , Lead , 'Copper , 'Jet , Diamond , Radium , 'Sapphire , Silver and Steel . 'Sapphire and Steel have been assigned . ' - Evening , Greville . - Good evening , Mr Harborough . - Good evening , Greville . - Mrs McDee . Mrs Harborough . Good evening , sir . - I like your monkey suit . - 1930s , sir . Absolutely authentic . Costumiers must be having a field day . Specially made by Lord Mullrine 's tailor . Must 've cost a fortune . So will shareholders have reduced dividends ? - God , I hope not . - Bags are in the car , Greville . Bags are in the car . - Sorry , sir . - How many have been invited ? I 've no idea , sir . Miss Emma saw to the invitations . Lord , that spells trouble . She 'll have half the county here . While the other half tries to get away . Keep your opinions to yourself , Annabelle . If Mullrine wants to indulge his fantasies , let him , will you ? Of course , darling . I think it 's fun . Honestly . Mrs Felicity McDee , my lord , and Mr Howard McDee . Mr and Mrs Felix Harborough . Oh , how beautiful ! How lovely you all look ! Hello , Felicity . How well you look . I do so wish George could have been here . He would have enjoyed it , wouldn 't he ? George would have hated it , Emma . He always left ostentatious nonsense to you and your brother . Yes . Yes , I suppose so . Annabelle ! That dress is quite stunning . Arthur , you 've been to a lot of trouble . - Yes , I have . - It 's dead right . Every detail . - Except for ... - Except for what ? Except for the black mourning crepe over my grandfather 's portrait . Surely on June 21st 1930 he was very much alive , wasn 't he Grandmama ? No , Mullrine and McDee , the whizz kids of the Depression . Hell-bent on making a second Mullrine fortune . - Yes , all right , Howard . - Sorry ! Greville , whisky and soda for the men folk , please . The ladies can have champagne or any of those newfangled cocktails . - Splendid ! - What will you have , Annabelle ? A Green Goddess - I believe they were the in thing in 1930 . Greville , a Green Goddess , please . Don 't be silly , you weren 't even around then . - Does this thing work ? - Everything works . I was following the Test . Wanted to see how Boycott was doing . Be my guest . Go on , switch it on . - They have to warm up . - Good . That 's very good . 'Here we are , back at the first Test 'as Bradman takes his stance for this fourth ball of the over . ' - Bradman ? - ' Larwood starts his long run . 'Ames , well back . Larwood bowls fast , a good length , 'and Bradman flicks it sweetly to the off 'but Wally Hammond is there . ' Bradman , Larwood , Ames , Wally Hammond ? This is extraordinary ! 'Australia still 123 for one wicket 'as Hammond returns the ball to Larwood . ' First Test of the 1930 season , England against Australia . 'Incidentally , speaking of Hammond 's fielding there 's a story about it . 'It seems about a year ago when Larwood was bowling , 'and indeed Bradman batting , just as today , Hammond was in the slips . 'Larwood bowled , Bradman made a stroke , there was a snick 'and Hammond dived full length and threw the ball up in triumph 'only unfortunately it wasn 't a ball , 'it was a swallow , which Hammond had caught as it ... ' All done by mirrors . Or tape recorders . Clever . I wish there was a bookie handy , I know who won that game . - It hasn 't ended yet ! - Let me see , it was ... I know every Test score going back to 1918 . England-Australia , first Test ... That 's funny , my memory 's normally rather good . How strange , I can 't remember . - Annabelle , are you all right ? - Yes , - I just felt as if someone had ... - Walked over your grave ? Yes . This house has that effect on a lot of people . George loathed it . On the contrary , as Emma will tell you , my late lamented partner did not loath this house , Felicity . He did some of his most creative work here . My sister always made him feel most welcome . Arthur ... please . He said it was an evil house . Oh , no , Felicity , surely not ? Nothing ever changes , George . - Bollinger 1927 ? - Of course . - Champagne doesn 't mature . That 's ... - Only three years old . - And 1927 was a very good year . - Yes , we had some only last week . We 've never had Bollinger ' 27 . - Haven 't we ? I seem to remember ... - What ? May I , sir ? I thought everyone but everyone drank Bollinger ' 27 . - I say , it 's quite dark outside . - Impossible , it 's not seven . And the weather 's glorious at Trent Bridge . You heard the wireless . No ! No , that 's impossible . - What 's the matter ? - That green door . - What about it ? - I ... I could swear it ... - it seemed to disappear . - Come on . That 's only your first glass of champagne ! - It disappeared . - Nonsense ! Only for a second or two . Doors don 't disappear , Felicity . - This one did . - That 's the door to my office . I know , Arthur . But it wasn 't there in 1930 , was it ? Damn ! I forgot about that . I wouldn 't have known anyway , I wasn 't born then . You built that office in 1938 , Arthur . I remember thinking how out of place that door looked . All right , Emma . That 's probably young Tony Purnell and his girlfriend . - Probably . - Oh , what 's her name ? - You didn 't invite anyone else ? - I don 't know , Arthur ! - You made the list of invitations . - Should I , sir ? - No . You go and receive them . - Very well . Greville , serve some drinks , will you , please ? Hello ? Good evening . Who is it ? Miles and Virginia Cavendish . Who ? This is Lord Mullrine 's party ? We were invited . Well ... it should be all right , then . I hope we 're not too late . The invitation was most specific . Allow me , sir ! Oh , Greville , thank you . This way , sir . Don 't be too long ! " The Honourable Miles and Mrs Cavendish " ? Yes . Miles and Virginia . I didn 't send that card . Cavendish , Cavend ... Oh , yes , he must be that chap who deals in futures . Would he mean all our futures ? Anybody mind if we have some music ? You 'll only get that test match . It 's a tape , remember ? Oh , how nice ! Jack Payne and his orchestra . - What 's that ? - Dance music , darling . Jack Payne 's all the rage at the moment . - Good heavens ! - What 's the matter ? - What 's happened to the tape ? - What tape , Felix ? The place seems very odd to me . Which side of the bed would you prefer ? - There 's no other way ? - Not now , no . Miles Cavendish ! Who chose that ? - You did . - I didn 't . Yes , you did . The host must have started this as a game . Well , now it 's become reality . I think I 'd rather be nearer the door . It 's funny , since I arrived I haven 't seen anything made later than 1930 . Nothing . What about the materials ? No synthetic fibres , no plastics , no nylon . As though we 've stepped back 50 years . I wonder if the people downstairs realise ? How long will it take you to get ready ? It really is getting awfully dark . Longest day of summer . What do you expect ? I hope it 's not going to rain . Put some lights on , draw the curtains . Never had summers like this in the ' 30s . I was looking forward to a lovely sunny weekend . Tea on the lawn tomorrow , with strawberries . It started out all right . - I 'd never noticed that before . - What ? You can see the church tower , almost as though there were a path to it . - You 're mistaken , Howard . - Oh ? Why ? Must be a trick of the light . The tower was V2'd - or was it " doodle bombed " ? - One or the other . In , er , 1944 or 1945 . - You sure , Emma ? - Positive . Terribly sad . It did look like a church tower . And it would have been there in 1930 , wouldn 't it ? This is just a game , it isn 't for real . This is 19 ... 19 what , Annabelle ? 19 ... - 1930 . June the 21st , 1930 . - Come on , Arthur . King George V is on the throne , MacDonald 's prime minister and eight months ago the American stock market collapsed . And we are in the midst of a depression . But McDee and I form Mullrine International here in this house . We built it and we believed in it . - It was a massive achievement ! - Right . Yes . Therefore you can see that church tower from that window . You can 't possibly know who won that test match ! The champagne we 've been drinking is definitely 1927 vintage and only three years old . And that damn green door shouldn 't be there ! - It 's a paradox . - What ? ! You can 't make it 1930 , you can only pretend . If it was 1930 only you , Emma and Mrs McDee could be here , the rest of us wouldn 't have been born . You 're amazing . Powerful . Rich beyond most people 's dreams and very very clever - bit of a genius . But even you can 't turn back the clock . If you could , Arthur , would you bring George back to life ? There 's still a draught in here , even with the curtains drawn . Would you ? Yes . - That 's interesting . - What 's interesting ? - I was wondering . - Wondering what ? I was wondering why the black mourning crepe has gone . Someone 's playing some clownish trick ! They couldn 't have done - we haven 't left the room . We couldn 't miss seeing someone reach up for that crepe . You 're right about that chill , Annabelle . It cuts right through the centre of this room . Why did it choose this house ? - It 's definitely here ? - Yes . But where ? Maybe it 's taken over someone downstairs . We have to find out which one . That won 't be easy , it could be any one of them . - Or all of them . - No . That wouldn 't make sense . No , of course it wouldn 't . There has to be a victim . Or victims . Anything you say , Virginia . Shall we go down ? Haven 't you forgotten something ... Miles ? Yes , very frustrating for you , Felix . Must be . Old dodderer like me refusing to retire . You 'll have to sooner or later . I can wait . The only way you 'll head Mullrine International is by burying me . Don 't tempt me . Yes , I used to love going to the flower show . Do you know Queen Mary 's opening it this year ? But I never get to London these days . - Queen Mary ? - Formidable lady , but so regal ! - I want to go , I hate them all . - Yes , all right . In the morning . Felix and Annabelle will have to get another lift ... Wow ! - All well , sir ? - Good evening , Greville . '52 years old . A totally repressed personality . ' - I hope the room is to your liking . - Marvellous . 'Devoted to the Mullrines . ' - ' The family or the house ? ' - ' Lord Mullrine . ' - Thank you , Greville . - This way , madam , sir . The honourable Miles and Mrs Cavendish . Oh , there you are ! We were beginning to think you 'd deserted us . - We were just changing . - What a delightful dress . I wish I was still young enough to wear fashionable things . - They 're back in fashion ? - At 60 it 's too late . - ' She 's 74 . ' - Thank you . 'Carrying a torch for a lost love . For 50 years . ' - Mr Cavendish , you look grand . - How nice of you to say so . Greville , our guests have no drinks . I 'm sorry , I 'm afraid I don 't drink . Oh . What a good idea , so sensible . Come and meet everybody . This is Mrs McDee . - And Howard McDee . - How do you do ? - Delighted . - Champagne 's awfully good . And this is ... Oh , dear . Poor Annabelle isn 't well , I hope she hasn 't caught a chill . - Is there anything I can do ? - I don 't know . Annabelle , are you still cold ? - Yes , don 't you feel it ? - I don 't believe I do . Virginia Cavendish , Annabelle Harborough . How do you do ? 'Has she a temperature loss ? She could be affected by time . ' - ' It 's possible . ' - How do you do ? - You haven 't been here before . - I 'm sorry ? - To this house . - No , have you ? Oh , yes , my husband 's Arthur Mullrine 's deputy . They 're in the library . Perhaps Greville could bring you something . - I think it 's passing . - Good . - Something wrong ? - Ah , Howard . - No , not really . - You 're here . Annabelle was just complaining of the cold . On Midsummer 's Day ? Oh , my dear . - ' Steel . ' - ' Yes ? ' 'They 're rather more than friends . ' Howard 's very attentive , isn 't he ? He 's always been a considerate boy . I wonder if Felix has noticed how considerate he is . Felix doesn 't notice anything that isn 't to do with business . Let 's not argue , Felix . Look at him now . - If that 's what you want . - I won 't discuss it now . You 're letting sentiment interfere with business ! - Are you losing your grip ? - Hmph ! That 'll be the day . You know your trouble , Felix ? You don 't enjoy business enough . That 'll keep me going when men like you have packed it in . Have a cigar . Lord Mullrine , nice of you to invite us . - Grosvenor . - Cavendish . Of course . Glad you could come . - I 'm Felix Harborough . - Deputy of Mullrine International . - You 're in the futures market ? - In a way . I 'm a futurologist . - Sounds like a fortune-teller ! - Fortunes . Yes , I like that ! My predictions are based on logical projections using the advanced physical sciences . - Speculative cybernetics ? - You 're not here to talk shop ! You told me just now you enjoyed ... You old ruffian , what are you trying to hide ? - Me ? Hide ? - You 're up to something ! - He using you to make a killing ? - Felix ... if I were you I 'd watch your wife . Young McDee takes after his grandfather , in more ways than one . I 'd better talk to my husband , if you 'll excuse me . Feli , dear . - My dear , you have no drink . - That 's perfectly ... No . Leave it to me . There is a time-break and someone in this house is causing it . - What about this room ? - It 's the same as the bedroom . - Nothing later than 1930 ? - Except that door . - And that 's ... - Out of place ? It is , rather . Thank you . - Champagne ? - No , thank you . - Chin-chin . - ' What 's he mean ? ' 'Say " chin-chin " . He can 't drink until you do . ' - Chin-chin ! - ' See ? ' It has no lock and no handle . What 's the point of a door if you can 't open it ? Exactly . You 've got it . 'There 's a barrier . ' - ' Barrier ? ' - Of course ! A certain man thinks that door is the door to end all doors . 'It 's a blue light . ' - Ask him . - ' Temperature ? ' 'Much lower . 'Possibly a ley line . There should be evidence . ' You have guessed , haven 't you ? What ? The door , whose idea it was . No , you tell me . Well , our host , His Lordship , of course . 'What 's behind it ? ' He 's got a special device . He 's the only person who knows how to use it . 'Something moving . ' 'Tell me . ' 'It 's twisting , turning ... and writhing . - ' It 's ... ' - More champagne ? 'Come back , Sapphire . Sapphire !

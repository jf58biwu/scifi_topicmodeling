 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . [ Lightning Crashing ] Wait ! I am Joshua , commander of the Israelites . Who are you , and what do you want among us ? We come ... from the future , Joshua . Rise . Leave them with me . The Lord appeared unto Moses and me ... in a cloud of dust ! After that ... all miracles are one miracle . But I must know if you are telling the truth . Joshua ! The warrior-prophet ... who brought down the walls ofJericho . So the Bible tells us . But are we supposed to accept the story literally ? Well , there he is ! Look ! General , that merely proves ... the historical existence of a man called Joshua . All the rest could be mere legend - poetry . We 're going to see the proof before our eyes . I always wanted to believe , and secretly doubted . [ Sighs ] At last , I 'll know . As a scientist , I don 't permit myself to believe in miracles . We 'll see whether or not the walls came tumbling down . - [ Thunder Rumbling ] - How do I know you come from the future ? And not from the King ofJericho ? For five days , my soldiers have been marching around the walls ofJericho . And the King ofJericho would give much ... to learn why . We come from a time where your God is our God . And everyone knows why . An angel of the Lord came to you . He commanded that your army march around Jericho ... once each day for six days , and seven times on the seventh day . And then the priests should blow their rams 'horns as a signal ... for all your men to raise a mighty shout . And the walls will fall down before them . I have revealed that to no one . Not even the captains who do my bidding . I believe you . Tell me . Have the people within the city lost spirit ? Or will they fight us to the death ? We only know that you send two spies into the city to find out . Your coming is a sign of the Lord ! You ... are those spies . Ready a division of soldiers ... to attack the south wall ... tonight ! [ Man ] Yes , sir . This is the city ofJericho . While we divert their attention at the south wall ... you will steal over the north wall ... and begin to accomplish your mission . But we 're strangers to your time and custom . Our ignorance might endanger a mission of such consequence . The Lord will guide you . [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . [ Footsteps Marching ] [ Softly ] Israelites ! Israelites ! Israelites attacking the south wall . ! To the south wall ! Hurry ! [ Men Shouting ] Soldiers , to the walls ! To the walls ! [ Shouting Continues ] - Now where ? - The Bible says the two spies hid ... in the house of a harlot named Rahab . [ Soldiers Clamoring ] Captain . - What is your will , O High Priest ? - Encourage your soldiers . Tell them I have consulted the oracle . - What does he say ? - Almighty Khemosh assures us ... the walls ofJericho are impregnable ! The Israelites are retreating . Tomorrow morning , we will make an offering . To Khemosh . [ People Chattering ] [ People Chattering ] - [ Chattering Stops ] - Almighty Khemosh ... each day , the Israelites are marching around our walls . And the people ofJericho grow more fearful . We beg you to accept this offering as proof ... that you 're not angry with us . That you 'll bring death ... to all the Israelites ! - Bring the sacrifice ! - [ Gong Sounds ] They usually sacrifice a sheep or a lamb . You should be proud , mistress , that your sister has been chosen by Khemosh . She 's so young . Almighty Khemosh ... we offer this young , unsullied virgin ... as your bride . Bride of Khemosh ... may your blood bring us victory . Sacrilege ! It 's like a miracle . My prayers have been answered . Those two strangers appearing at the last moment - It is the will of Khemosh . Only Israelites would dare commit such sacrilege . You defile the sacrificial virgin by the touch of your hands . You ! You 're no longer worthy of Khemosh . Go ! [ Sighs ] Take the spies to the dungeons , force them to reveal the plans ofJoshua ... and then hang them ! By the fingers , outside the city walls . As a lesson to all Israelite dogs . Take him out . [ High Priest ] After him . ! After him . ! After him ! Follow me ! Killer . Savage ! Take Shala to my father 's house . Mother has wept enough . [ Soldier ] The street ends here , Captain . Search in the other earthenware pots . - Nothing here , sir . - Come on , men . [ Door Rattling ] - Rahab . - How do you know my name ? Your name will be known to everyone for countless generations . [ Knocking ] - Who is it ? - [ Woman ] It is I , mistress . Shh ! - Mistress , he is one of the Israelite spies ! - I know . You risked your life for my sister . - Why did you come here ? - They were after me . Yours was the only open door . - Mistress , call the guard ! - You 'll be safe here . For your silence . It isn 't necessary to buy my loyalty . It is only that I ... fear for your life if you harbor the Israelite spy . I 'll help you to escape . My house is built into the city wall . And this window looks out the wall . It 's 30 feet to the ground below , for the city is built on a hill . When it gets dark , I 'll let you down with a rope . I 'm grateful to you - deeply grateful - for all your help . But I can 't leave without finding my friend . But he was taken to the dungeon . - Where is it ? - It 's beneath the palace , guarded by soldiers . There must be some way to get past them . It 's impossible ! And they 're looking for you everywhere . But there might be another way in . One person would know that . Run to my father 's house , say that I need him . Quickly . Rahab - Why are you doing this for me ? You saved my sister from Khemosh . Don 't you believe in Khemosh ? I know that the Lord has given you the land . I have heard how he dried up the waters of the Red Sea ... before you came out of Egypt . And how he exterminated the two kings who lived on the other side of theJordan . And how all hearts are stricken with terror before him . For the Lord , your God ... is God of the heavens above . And of the Earth below . [ Gasping ] [ Gasping ] Death can come easily , or ... painfully , Israelite . Yours can be a quick and easy end ... if you tell meJoshua 's plans . It will be of no use to you . Joshua will destroy you . Your king , and your whole city ! You can 't stop him . Any more than you can command the sun to stand sill . Why are his soldiers marching around our walls ? - It is God 's will . - What God ? Where is this God ? Is it hidden in the Ark that his priests carry ? God is spirit . Invisible . Everywhere . Here too ? Then why doesn 't he help you ? Was it this God of yours that helped the other spy to escape ? Then why should he help him and not you ? Who helped him to escape ? We 'd have caught him by now if he didn 't have an accomplice here in Jericho . - Where is he hiding ? In what house ? - I don 't know . You lie . I want the traitor 's name . Loosen his tongue . [ Gasping , Panting ] - [ Groans , Screams ] - Stop it ! Stop ! Shift him , whatever the risk . There 's no earthly chance that Tony will get to him in time . But the Bible says that both spies escaped . And it was Rahab who helped them . We 've no time for Bible stories . Doug 's life is in danger now . All I 'm sure of is , if Doug cracks under torture , they 'll get Rahab and Tony too ! [ Groaning ] - The image is drifting . - Quick . Get back to him . Before it 's too late . We 're losing our time lock . [ Frequency Oscillating ] [ Sighs ] - [ Clicks ] - He 's gone . - [ Footsteps Marching ] - Joshua 's soldiers . This is the sixth day they 've marched around the wall . I used to dream that someday I 'd hear the sound of those marching feet . The women in the marketplace used to throw mud at me . And their brutal husbands came here , and I had to ... pour their wine , and wait on them - And they 'd give me a few coins for their trouble . And I picked them up with shame and hatred . And I dreamed that someday , there 'd be a day of reckoning . When a great army would besiegeJericho . And tear down its wall . And destroy every house in the town . - And your house would be the only one spared . - Yes ! - That 's my dream . How did you know that ? - I read it in a book . Called the Bible . A book of divine revelation . - Your name is in that book , Rahab . - [ Marching Continues ] It says , " " When Joshua destroyed Jericho ... " " only Rahab did he spare . " " For in that whole city ... she was the only good woman . " [ Knocking ] I 'll look . - Father . - My daughter . Thank you , Ahza . You may leave us . Why did you send for me ? The Israelite who saved little Shala is hiding here . Here ? What will they do to you if they find him ? Father , he risked his life for us . We must do as much for him . Lead me to him . He 's here , in front of you . He has the face of a thoughtful man . But his thoughts are strange to us . He has the face of a man far ahead of his time . - Can you help him ? - But - My father used to be a great architect . The king selected him to build the new palace . When it was completed , he feared my father would reveal its secrets . He rewarded my father by ... blinding him . Now , there is no one left to support my family ... but my daughter , my firstborn , Rahab ... who sold her honor to - But he remembers all the plans of the palace . He remembers everything . Every passageway , secret entrance - My friend is in the dungeon . Is there any way to get to him ? Yes . There is a way . Go to the statue of Khemosh . Hidden behind it ... is a carved lotus . Turn it , and a door will open which will lead you to the dungeon . Thank you . I must go now . May God go with you and bring you and your friend back safe . - Ahza ? - Yes , mistress ? - Take my father to his house . - No ! I will stay here . But it 's dangerous for you to stay here . It 's a long time since I was of use . - Where is the Israelite ? - Gone to find his friend . I 'm going up on the roof . I can watch the statue of Khemosh . Come , Ahza . I want to see if anything goes wrong . Take care ! The neighboring roofs are filled with eyes . We must seem busy . We can be spreading out the flax to dry . Here . Unbind this . [ Metal Clattering ] [ Shouting ] [ Grunting ] - Can you walk ? - I think so . - How 'd you find me ? - Come on . I 'll show you . [ Groaning ] Kill him . Mistress ? There 's no point in watching any longer . He must have been caught , or he 'd be back by now . They may both be dead ! - How long are we to go on look - - Ahza ! Soldiers . In front of the statue . Keep spreading the flax . I must leave . - Oh , stay , mistress ! We 'll all be killed ! - Shh ! - [ Frequency Oscillating ] - Try to get them back . The fix is still drifting . That 's strange . It never reacted this way before . - Increase power by 3.6 . - There 's no time for half-measures . - Put it to maximum ! - Ann , that 's too dangerous . It 'll short out the circuits and blow us all up . - The city ofJericho . - I can 't hold it . It 's still drifting . Consecrate yourselves . For tomorrow , the Lord is going to perform wonders among you . You will begin marching at sunrise . And circle the wall seven times . You must not let your voices be heard . Nor let a word escape your lips . Till you hear a long blast on the rams ' horns . Then , all of you must raise up a mighty shout ! We 're losing it ! I 'll intensify the probe . [ Sighs Deeply ] At last . They 're alive . Can we hold them ? Rahab . What 's your hurry , Rahab ? How about you give me one of those nice , ripe figs , huh ? - [ Chattering ] - Here you go . Help yourself , men . Mm . That fig 's given me a taste for something more . Captain . The king commands his army to search for the two spies . Two spies ? But one of them is already in the dungeon . He escaped . Is he a sorcerer , that he can pass through stone walls ? - My men already fear the Israelites ' magic . - Then capture those two ... before your army 's too demoralized to fight . It could mean the difference between victory and defeat . Search the city , street by street , house by house ... and room by room . Men ! It is my mistress . They 're searching the city for you , house by house . They think you 're sorcerers and must be destroyed before the soldiers lose all courage . Mistress , if they are found here , what 'll become of us ? - We 'll go . - No , you can 't leave the house . This window . It 's built into the city wall . We can climb down on a rope . Not till dark , when the guards can 't see you . My daughter 's right . We will hide you . Thank you , Father . Ahza , watch the door . Come with me . You can stay here till it 's safe . Rahab , you 've done so much for us already . We can 't ask you to endanger yourself anymore . - [ Knocking ] - Soldiers ! [ Knocking Continues ] Open up ! Please . You must hurry . Hide behind the flax . - I 'll cover you . - [ Knocking Continues ] [ Soldier ] Open up . ! - Don 't answer . - [ Soldier # 2 ] Open up . ! Warn Rahab . Run ! Run ! Open up ! Mistress ! The soldiers . They 're at the door . - What shall we do ? - We 'll let them in . [ Knocking Continues ] - [ Knocking ] - Open up . ! I 'm here , Father . Come in , Captain . I didn 't think I 'd see you again so soon . We 're here by order of the king , searching for the two Israelite spies . - Have you seen them ? - They did come to me , but I sent them away . Search the house . They only just left . If you hurry , you might overtake them . Maybe . And maybe they are still here . - Any sign of them ? - Nothing , Captain . - Did you see them leave ? - My father 's blind . What about you ? Men ! You 're losing time . You might still catch them . There 's no hurry . They can 't get far . - They 're not up here , sir . - Wait for me below . Your men are waiting for you , Captain . - Well , let ' em wait . - Not here . [ Chuckles ] Sir ? We searched the streets . We 're moving on . I 'll come back later . If the spies come back , let us know ! It 'll be worth it to you . The king has offered a reward for their capture . A thousand talents of silver ! [ Door Closes ] The soldiers are gone . Is it dark yet ? Ahza ? Ahza ! It 'll soon be dark enough for us to get down the wall . - Will you be safe ? - The captain can 't come back ... until the whole town 's been searched , and then it won 't matter . Come . Soldier ? Soldier ! I 'm Ahza , servant of Rahab . I know where the spies are hidden . I 'll get the captain . And I claim the reward ! - He 's going to be our big danger . - Here . This rope is more than long enough to reach the ground . Rahab ! Rahab ! Wait here . - What is it , Father ? - Is Ahza with you ? - No . Where is she ? - I heard nothing . She left without making a sound . Ahza . Where have you been ? Why did you go out ? Why do you creep in like a cat ? I went to see if the soldiers had left the street . - You 're lying . - No , mistress . I - I would have asked your permission , but you were busy with the men on the roof . - You went out to warn the soldiers ! - No ! You did it for the reward ! For the thousand talents of silver ! - [ Sobbing ] No ! - Have I treated you badly ? Have I starved you or beat you , like the other maids are ? Haven 't you eaten the same food as I ? Worn my clothes ? How could you betray me ? Yes ! Your food , your clothes . Yours . ! I want mine . ! They call you the lowest woman in the town . But I am even lower than you - the servant of the harlot . ! I want what you have . I want to be what you are and have my own servant . [ Sobbing ] Oh , forgive me ! I 'll lie to the soldiers when they come . I swear it ! Please ! I 'll deny everything ! You haven 't a moment to lose . When the soldiers come back , she 'll inform on you . But you will have gone . It 'll be her word against mine . Go quickly for my daughter 's sake , as well as your own . Rahab . We 'll tellJoshua we would have been killed without your help ... and the help your father gave us . And will my house be spared , as your Bible says ? The Bible says , " " A red sash will be a sign for the invading army . " As soon as we 've gone , gather your family under this roof . They 'll be safe here with you . Not if we don 't hurry . Get him ! - Arrest that woman ! - Rahab ! Rahab ! What is he doing to her ? Get away , old man . You know the penalty for treason . [ Knocking ] She locked me in because I sent for you . - Take her out . - Remember . The reward is mine . I captured him . The reward is mine . Will you cheat me out of it ? Am I to get nothing , when I earned all of it ? There 's your reward . - Just a string of beads ? - You want more ? Here . More ? What about this ? Or this ? Take your hands off her ! Don 't be afraid , Rahab . We 're not going to die here . It may take a miracle to save us , but a miracle will happen . I 'm not afraid . Where is your magic now , Israelite ? Your armies have marched away and left you here to die . - They 'll come back . - When ? Even now , they 're marching towards your city again . Can you see through walls ? - I can read the future . - [ Army Marching ] - Listen ! - [ Marching Continues ] They 'll march around your city for the seventh time . And then they 'll blow their horns . The warriors will shout , and the walls ofJericho will topple into the dust . He is a sorcerer ! He brought the army back by magic . He must be killed at once , before he can work more evil . [ Marching Continues ] Almighty Khemosh , you have proven your power ... and delivered unto us the spy ofJoshua ... and the traitorous harlot who hid him - [ Marching ] It is ordained that they be stoned to death . Stone them ! We can 't wait . We must try to shift him . But we don 't know if Doug is still alive . We can 't transfer Tony without possibly losing Doug forever ! Well , then we must try to bring Tony back through the Tunnel . - And Rahab too . - No . Even if it were possible ... and they survived , we dare not trespass upon sacred history ... by bringing Rahab out of her time . Are we to see them stoned , without even trying to - Ann , the Bible says that the two spies saved Rahab . Here . " " And Rahab , the harlot , and her father 's household , Joshua spared . And she lived among the Israelites , as do her descendants to this day . " - Joshua , 6 : 25 . - General , don 't you realize something 's gone wrong ! What 's happening to Tony and Rahab was never written . If you won 't bring them back , I will . - Now , wait . You may kill them , instead of - - [ Screams ] What could have ... made that happen ? Heaven knows . We 've lost our power to save them . The decision has been taken out of our hands . - You did well ! - [ Marching ] Signal the blowing of the rams ' horns ! Stone them ! Stone them ! Stone the harlot ! The Israelite spy ! Stone them ! Stone them ! Stone them ! Stone them ! [ Horns Blowing ] [ Continues ] - [ Soldiers Shouting ] - Rahab ! The miracle ! It 's come ! [ Shouting ] The wall ! The wall is going ! - [ Rumbling ] - [ Screaming ] God has appeared in a cloud of dust ! We 're witnessing a miracle . A tornado is a natural phenomenon ... caused by a centrifugal whirlpool of wind . Whatever creates faith is a miracle . - [ Screaming ] - [ Wind Roaring ] Tell me , old man . Is your family here ? All except Rahab and your friend . - The soldiers took them . - Where ? To the temple , for execution . Rahab . No , Khemosh ! No ! Look , your father 's all right . Are the transfer circuits operational ? We 'll know in a moment . I 'll try a retrieve . It 's come true , just as you said . Rahab . Go to them . You 'll be safe there . And you ? Will you be with me ? Yes . Always . [ Tropical Birds Calling ] [ Groans ] - How many dead ? - We have killed 1 2 , Capitan . That is example enough . The rest of them will run to the hills . We will go back to camp . I 'd say , from the way he 's dressed , we 're somewhere in South or Central America . And that crossbow makes it about the 1 6th century . - The others look Spanish . - [ Objects Clattering ] They 're Spanish , all right . Tony , if that 's Cortes and his army , we 're right in the middle ... of one of the biggest bloodbaths in history . I must warn you now , Chief . She will suffer great pain , unless you tell us what we want to know . Kill them !

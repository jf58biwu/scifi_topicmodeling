 ( Thunder ) ( Six ) Where am I ? ( Two ) In the village . ( Six ) What do you want ? ( Two ) Information . ( Six ) Whose side are you on ? ( Two ) That would be telling . ( Two ) We want information ... ( Two ) Information ... ( Two ) Information . ( Six ) You won 't get it . ( Two ) By hook or by crook ... ... we will . ( Six ) Who are you ? ( Two ) The new Number Two . ( Six ) Who is Number One ? ( Two ) You are Number Six . ( Six ) I am not a number . I am a free man ! ( Number Two laughs ) ( Fanfare on PA ) Good morning ! Good morning ! What a lovely day it is ! Rise and shine ! Rise and shine ! Before our music programme , here are two announcements . The weather - the fine spell will continue for another month . Your local council - and remember it is YOUR local council , democratically elected by you - has organised a great new competition . Can you paint ? Can you draw ? Can you model in clay ? If you can , then your day is just six weeks today . More about this later , but now - music . He makes even putting on his gown seem a gesture of defiance . There are methods we haven 't used yet . I want him with a whole heart , body and soul . ( Jaunty music on radio ) ( Man ) He 'll crack . Perhaps , but I don 't want a man of fragments . ( Music continues ) Fascinating . - ( Man ) He doesn 't bend . - ( Two ) That 's why he 'll break . If he 'll answer one simple question , the rest will follow . Why did he resign ? Control Room . Supervisor . Have you found the helicopter ? I think it 's in range . Yes , she 's on the radar now . Shall we make contact ? No , but tell me when it 's due . I want to meet it . Your move , young man . Ahh , Yes . - You know what I 'll do ? - Resign ? That announcement , the exhibition of arts and crafts . These aren 't all they might be . I 'll make a set . Used to be quite a handyman . - You entering ? - No . You 're a fool , Number Six . That 's my opinion . - Really ? - You 'll be here as long as you live . How ever long that is ? Try to settle down . Don 't be uncooperative . Was there a time when you were not co-operative ? Don 't fight lost battles . - You came here voluntarily ? - Impudent , too , eh ? Wish I 'd had you in my regiment . Which regiment was that ? Which army ? Good morning , General ! - The General seems a little sour . - Mate in seven moves . Ohh . How many do you know ? - A few more . - We must play . ( Siren ) Certainly we must - by post . ( Laughs ) I must add sense of humour to your file ! They tend to leave out such important things . - ( Six ) What crime did she commit ? - Just nervous tension . She 's here to recuperate . ( Six ) How much are you charging ? I really must bring your file up to date . ( Two ) Sit down , my dear chap ! File number six , section 42 , subsection six , paragraph three . Add " sense of humour strong and unimpaired . " Thank you . That will be all . - One lump or two ? - Read the file . Yes , but it would save time if you just answered . - Are you out of time ? - ( Tuts ) Does not take sugar . Frightened of putting on weight ? No , nor of being reduced . That 's excellent ! I am glad you 're here . You really are a model . But I don 't run on clockwork . You will , my dear chap . - You will . - Do you think so ? Do you still think you can escape ? - I 'll do better than that . - Oh ? - I 'll escape and come back . - Come back ? Escape , come back and wipe this place off the face of the earth . Subsection six , paragraph four . Add " persecution complex amounting to mania . " Paranoid delusions of grandeur . Don 't worry , Number Six , you 'll be cured . I 'll see to it . If you have so much as a bad dream , you 'll come whimpering to tell it to me . Whimpering . ( Two ) Watch . Just watch . ( Six ) Why ? She 's your new neighbour , that 's all , the new Number Eight . - Where 's the old one ? - He vacated the premises . - He escaped ? - ( Two laughs ) - ( Six ) No funeral ? - ( Two ) You need a body . Look , she 's getting up ! It 's like old times , isn 't it ? Do you remember your first day ? ( Sighs ) Thank God , I 'm home . - An exact replica of her own room . - Of course . Number Eight , please . ( Phone bleeps ) - Hello ? - Good morning . Quite recovered ? No ill-effects from the journey ? Who is it ? Where am I ? There 's nothing to be afraid of , my dear . Come and have lunch with me - Number Two , the Green Dome . - ( Hangs up ) - Hello ? A most pleasant addition . I 'm sure you 'll agree . - Hello ? - Will you be neighbourly ? I 'll do a deal with you . Tell me one thing and I 'll release you . - Why did you resign ? - Release me ? From the Village ? That 's not much to ask , is it ? If you insist on staying , I do hope you 'll attempt to settle down . This exhibition that 's coming up ... Wait a minute . There ! " At the age of 1 5 , top of his class in woodwork . " That 's the sort of thing . Join in ! I 'll make you a door handle . ( Number Two laughs ) You 'll be back ! Whimpering . ( Fanfare on PA ) Good morning ! Further news of the arts and crafts exhibition . Your finance committee have decided on the prizes . There will be five prizes in each age group . The exhibit judged the best in any group will receive a prize of 2,000 free work units ... ( Eight ) Excuse me . Could you please tell me where the Green Dome is ? Certainly . Across the square , you can 't miss it . - It 's crazy ... - Eh ? - Where am I ? - The Village . ( Both ) Lovely day ! - It sounds like a salute . - It is . Could you take me over there ? Certainly . Across the square , you can 't miss it . - Can we get a car ? - Taxis , local service only . - Where will they take you ? - Anywhere , as long as you arrive here at the end . That 's why they 're called local . Why are these people here ? Why are you ? ( Car horn ) Here you are - the Green Dome . - Who is Number Two ? - Who is Number One ? - I 'm frightened . - Goodbye . I 've done nothing wrong . - All I did was resign . - No use telling me . ( Six ) Evening . That 's a ... long lunch . - Yes . - Nightcap ? Nightcap ? Drink . One good thing here - it 's cheap . Genuine non-alcoholic whisky , 24 work units , or would you prefer genuine non-alcoholic vodka ? 1 6 work units . I hope there 's nothing significant in that . Yes , I would prefer it , Mr ... ? Sorry , no name . I am Number Six you are Number Eight . I didn 't think it would be like this . Are ... er , you Russian ? Estonian . Russian . - We don 't think so . - You speak good English . - It was my job . - From which you resigned . Number Two is a very charming man . - Yes . - I expected his assistant to be . Me ? What about you , Number Eight ? I 'm no Number Eight or anything else . My name is Nadia Rakowski . And I 've been interrogated enough today . Good night . Be seeing you . ( Footsteps ) May I join you ? You 're a good neighbour , I hope ? ( Two ) There are people who talk and people who don 't , which means some people leave this place and some who do not leave . You are obviously staying . ( Six ) You 're just as much a prisoner as I am . Of course , I know too much - we 're both lifers . I am an optimist . It doesn 't matter who Number One is . It doesn 't matter which side runs the Village . ( Six ) It 's run by one side . ( Two ) But both sides are becoming identical . What has been created is an international community , a blueprint for world order . When both sides realise they 're the same , they 'll see this is the pattern for the future . The whole earth as the Village ? That is my hope . What 's yours ? To be the first man on the moon . Well , must go . Delightful chat . Thank you , Number Six . ( Two ) International swimmer . At the age of 1 7 ... Olympic bronze medallist . Control Room . What visual range do you have out to sea ? ' Do you mean direct TV transmission ? - Yes . - Two miles . - Then radar . - Thank you . - Control Room is ready for you . - I 'll be right there . She 'll be out of range soon . She 's kept in training . Oh , well , Orange Alert . ( Eerie noise ) ( Roaring ) Don 't touch her . We 'll take care of her . Meet me at the hospital , Number Six . Be right there . Oh , Number Six ! How good of you to come ! - Could you help me ? - How ? You 've probably got to know Number Eight best ... Come with me . - Look . - ( Interrogator speaking ) I don 't want to be hard on her . She 's not important . I 'm surprised they sent her here . ( Control ) Why did you go ? Were you attempting suicide ? Have you noticed any suicidal tendencies ? - What are you doing to her ? - Nothing . The floor is electrified - four seconds on , four seconds off . It takes just three seconds to get to the door . She can leave whenever she likes . ( Two ) She 's caught on at last . ( Electricity crackles ) ( Interrogator speaking ) One ... Two ... ( Two ) If she has confidence , she 's fine . It 's self-inflicted . ( Interrogator ) What was in your mind ? What were you thinking ? Tell us . What was in your mind ? What was the purpose of your swim ? What was in your mind ? Were you attempting suicide ? Suicide ? Suicide ? What was in your mind ? What was ... ( Two ) She 's going to do it . ( Crackle ) Yes . That 's better . ( Interrogator ) Mind ! Mind ! Mind ! ... No , switch off ! Kill me , kill me , kill me , kill me ! ( Sobs ) Well , well . We 'll just have to try something else . Are you sure you can 't help ? I find this most distasteful . Let her go . Looks like a suicidal tendency , eh ? - Let her go ! - Is that an order ? All right ... You wanted a deal . I 'll make a deal with you . ( Nursery rhyme music ) - Let her go and I 'll collaborate . - You 'll what ? - Isn 't that what you wanted ? - So obvious a weakness in you ? - Why not ? - For which you 'll collaborate ? Don 't get too excited , I 'll tell you nothing . I 'll join in , try to settle down , even carve something for the exhibition ... If I turn her over to you , you 'll do some woodwork for me ? - That 's your deal ? - The best you 'll get . You really are the limit , Number Six . File number six , section 42 , subsection six , new paragraph five . " Overweening sense of self-importance . " " While here , his egomania has , if anything , increased . " Well ? All right . She 's all yours . Be seeing you . ( Soothing music on radio ) ( Whistles ) Good morning . You 're early . I 'll do that . - One egg or two ? - Two , I think . One egg or two . - Here you are . - That 's so nice . Be seeing you . Things couldn 't be going better . I 'll pay them a call . Good morning . Settling down , I hope ? - Thank you . - No swimming today , eh ? - No , the woods . - Naughty ! To carve for the exhibition . I 'm doing some abstracts . You 're not using offensive weapons ? You know the rule about such things . They may be dangerous . Oh , no . Abstract art is basically primitive . I 've made my own tools . Doing as the caveman did , eh , Number Six ? I may even invent fire . ( Number Two laughs ) Ah ! They can 't hear us . You can talk freely . Can I ? You still think it 's a trap ? I don 't know . Are you here because you discovered the whereabouts of the Village ? - Don 't ! - You know where it is . ( Eight ) I know there 's no escape . ( Six ) Not even by sea . You tried it . I was a fool . I couldn 't swim so far . How far ? To where ? - It 's no good . - Isn 't it ? If I knew where I was sailing from , I could calculate where I was sailing to . - Sail ? - By boat . Are you going ? - I must think . - Keep to the paths . I say ! What is it ? It won 't make sense until all three pieces are finished . - Entries are due in two weeks . - I 'll be ready . Axe , stone chisels ... Even these aren 't allowed , technically speaking . I 'm sure you can wink a blind surveillance eye , can 't you ? I wouldn 't dream of interfering . Delightful . Can I give you a lift back ? No , thanks . I 'll carry on while it 's light . - Be seeing you . - And you . Not for long . ( PA ) Good evening . Curfew time . Sleep tight . 1 5 minutes from now to curfew . Meanwhile , allow us to lull you away with ... ( Soothing guitar music ) ( Buzzer ) Is it safe to talk ? Speak softly . - ( PA ) Curfew in five minutes . - Tell me ... To curfew - the minutes are five . The language of love . - I know where the Village is . - How ? I work for the Government . Which ... which government ? That doesn 't matter . I saw a secret file on the Village by accident . Did you ... have access to other secret information ? Yes . - Where are we now , dear ? - Lithuania . ( PA ) Curfew time - one minute . Lithuania ... On the Baltic . That means making for West Germany , Denmark ... That 's 300 miles , at least . ( Eight ) It doesn 't have to be . Why not ? We could go to Poland . Take me with you . Will I be safe ? I can 't answer for the British authorities , for either of us . - Can you answer for you ? - I give you my personal guarantee . 30 miles . What ? That 's how far we are from the Polish border . Beyond , on the coast , there 's a village , Braniewo . Fisher people . They resist them . There 's a little group . I know them . I have a contact , he 'll do anything for us . That 's where you were going ? Do you know what I want ? To hear the chimes of Big Bill . Big Ben ... I 'll never call you anything else . Good night , Nadia . - Good night , Big Ben . - Big Bill . ( Chimes ) ( Big band music ) Good afternoon . Excuse me a minute , Number Eight . Number Six , the Awards Committee are intrigued with your abstract , but they 're mystified . Could you spare a moment ? - Certainly , with pleasure . - Excuse us . Remarkably high standard , don 't you agree ? Highly original . ( Two ) Ah , General . Excellent ! I 've seen your stuff , Number Six . I didn 't like it . Is this your chess set ? - It 's nothing . - It 's very good . Yes , I quite like the King , I must confess . ( Six ) The King ? Yes ... yes ... First class . Glad to see you 're settling down . Thank you very much . Here he is , our very own Epstein ! - Yes ? - What does it mean ? - It means what it is . - Brilliant . It means what it is . Brilliant ! Oh , you mustn 't let me influence the Awards Committee . What puzzled me was the fact you 'd given it a title - " Escape " . This piece ... What does it represent to you ? - A church door ? - Right first time . I see what he means . This other piece here , of the same general line , but more abstract representing freedom or a barrier , depending how you look at it . The barrier 's down , the door is open , you 're free to go ... Free to escape ... to escape to this . The symbol to human aspirations - knowledge , freedom , escape . - Why the crosspiece ? - Why not ? Splendid ! I was worried for a moment . The only thing I don 't understand ... - Yes ? - Where is Number Two ? ( Applause ) And now ... and now the special prize for the over-60 group . This goes , for a magnificent tapestry , to Number 38 ! ( Applause ) Well done , 38 ! And now ... and now the prize of prizes - the merit award of 2,000 work units for the best work of all . And the committee have awarded it to ... Number Six ! - Speech , dear chap ! - Pardon ? - Speech . - Yes ... Ladies and gentlemen , er , fellow citizens ... My work is its own satisfaction . Spoken like a true artist . I am , however , deeply honoured by this award . I feel , nevertheless , that it should have gone to someone whose work and long life in this village has been an example to us all - Number 38 . It 's not for me to reverse the decision of the committee , however , I would like to use these 2,000 work units to buy ... Number 38 's work to hang in my own home . - Agreed ? - ( Crowd ) Bravo ! ( Big band music ) ( Fanfare ) ( PA ) Good morning ! Good morning ! What a lovely day it is again . Rise and shine ! Rise and shine ! First , your weather . It will be hot and fine all day . Though the fresh breeze will continue . - How much further ? - Two miles . If your geography 's correct , just around the next headland . Calling Number Two , calling Number Two . There , almost out of range . 30 miles , eh ? Better contact Post Five , just in case . And then Orange Alert . Orange Alert . Orange Alert . That 's it . See the cave ? We 're catching a crosswind . - Look ! - ( Roaring ) Swim for it ! Swim for it ! ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshots ) Nadia ! ( Speaking Polish ) Pencil , paper . ( Speaking Polish ) Ask him to transmit this to London immediately . ( Speaking Polish ) He will not understand it , it is in code . It is a delivery note . What route are we taking ? I understand . By sea - Gdansk to Danzig , you know , by air to Copenhagen , by air again to London . - Quick , now . - His watch . Ask for his watch . This no good - seawater - no good - your watch . Ah . - What now ? - Quick , please . - Big Ben ? - What ? I just wanted to hear your voice . I don 't chime . The chimes should occur in about ... 1 2 hours time . - Big Ben ... - Hmm ? - Yeah ? - I feel a bit sick . That 's all right . Hold out . It 's only another three hours at sea . - Big Ben ... ? - Yeah ? - Have you got a wife in England ? - No . Don 't talk any more . - Big Ben ... - Yeah ? I feel a bit better . That 's great . That 's ... marvellous . Wonderful ... Good night . ( Telephone rings ) Fotheringay here . Yes , I 've seen a copy of the deciphered message . What time would you say ? Good . Yes , I can 't wait to see him . If that was ... If that was Copenhagen ... It 's less than an hour and a half to go . Big Ben ... ? Yeah ? Where are we going to land in England ? I don 't know . If my message was received correctly , we 'll land in an office that I shall know very well in London . - Big Ben ... ? - Yeah ? Are you engaged to someone ? Is that the right word - engaged ? Go to sleep . ( Baggage handler ) Blimey , this one 's a weight ! You two take that side . Watch it , this is supposed to be fragile ! - Evening , Colonel . - Evening . Everything 's gone to plan . Our friend will be with us any minute . Right , get it open . - Colonel ... - All right ? - Fotheringay ... - Hello , old man . Allow me to introduce you to Nadia . How do you do , my dear ? Right . Leave us to it , old chap . - See you later , I hope . - Yes , I hope so , Fotheringay . ( Chimes of Big Ben ) - Are we here ? - Shh . ( Chimes ) Is that it ? Yes ... That 's it . Would you mind waiting in the other room ? Peters ? It 's all right . Go with them . See you later . Well , the return of the prodigal son . I don 't see any fatted calf . - Did you expect one ? - No . Tell me , who 's she ? Nadia Rakowski . Oh ? What was her name when she left Peckham to train for the Bolshoi ? You haven 't changed , have you ? She told me she was Estonian . - In the Village . - Village ? She was Number Eight . Don 't you know about it ? - I ask the questions . - That 's what Number Two said . - Number Two ? - Chairman of the Village . - What village ? - I forgot . You don 't know . The Village is a place where people turn up who have resigned from a certain sort of job , have defected , or have been extracted . The specialised knowledge in their heads is of great value . Are you sure there 's no Village here ? - Where is this Village ? - Lithuania , the Baltic . - How did you find out ? - Nadia told me . - How did she know ? - She came across a secret file . On catching spies ? I risked my life to come back here because I thought it was different . It is , isn 't it - different ? ! My dear chap , I do apologise . You 've had a long journey . I expect you need a decent drink . Scotch ? - 24 work units . - What ? - It cost that in the Village . - Ah , the Village . Surely you know ? You resigned from a highly top-secret post , then promptly vanished . - I was kidnapped . - Really ? How dramatic . And then after a gap of months we hear you 're coming back from behind the Iron Curtain ... - You think I 've gone over . - And come back to carry on . - No . - " No , " he says . " No " ? Nyet . What sort of imbeciles do you think we are ? ( Chimes ) - What do you want me to do ? - Quite a lot of things . Let 's start at square one . First , why did you resign ? - It was a matter of conscience . - Listen , sonny boy ... - ( Chimes ) - Do you think you are safe in London ? If they thought it worth kidnapping you , it 's worth killing you . I doubt if you 'll be alive 24 hours outside here without protection . - Do you want it ? - And the girl ? - If you co-operate . - Political asylum guaranteed . - That depends . - No , it 's guaranteed ! So long as you keep your part of the bargain . - All right . - Why did you resign ? ( Chimes ) I resigned ... - because ... - ( Chimes stop ) For a very long time ... Just a minute . - ( Traffic passing outside ) - It 's eight o 'clock . That 's right , and there are many questions . First , why did you resign ? Big Ben has just struck eight . - My watch says eight . - So ? I was given this watch in Poland . I wanted to check the time to make sure the trip tallied with a journey to London . Which it presumably did . Explain to me how a man in Poland had a watch showing English time when there 's one hour 's difference ! Maybe he was slow . I 'll bet he was . ( Traffic passing outside ) ( Traffic stops ) ( Traffic starts again ) ( Big band plays ) Well done . Back to London before embarrassing questions are asked . - What 's my next assignment ? - The Colonel will give you your orders . Be seeing you . ( PA ) Good evening , citizens . Your local council is announcing another exciting competition . The subject this time - seascapes . File on Number Six , section 42 , subsection one , paragraph one . - Back to the beginning . - You were right about him . - I told you . - Don 't worry . It was a good idea . You did your best . I 'll stress it in my report .

 THE SPIES WHO CAME IN FROM THE SEMI-COLD Come in . A new batch of exploding girls is ready , Doctor . What a fabulous machine I 've invented , it does everything automatically , when we used to do it all by hand . Perfect . Hardjob , the pressure gauge , please . Fantastic ! Let 's see . Plastic injection fine tuning . - Check . - Excellent . Engage circuit . Circuit engaged . Contact ! They look so real , don 't they ? In fact , they 're a diabolical creation , a product of my scientific genius . Each of these beauties is equipped with a little device ... which in our profession ... or rather , my profession ... is known as the Kiss of Death . A touch from their lips that has more pressure ... than an innocent kiss completes a circuit and ... bang ! A glorious explosion that will destroy my lovely creations ... along with their victims . Why am I doing all this ? It 's quite simple really . You see ... I 've made a deal with my Chinese friends , we 're going to share control of the entire planet . And what of America and Russia ? Two obstacles to be removed . To begin with , my lovely exploding girls will eliminate certain annoying generals . Then , when the only survivor is General Willis ... my plan will move into it 's final phase . A simple one , as the general looks exactly like me . An incredibly charming man . We should get a move on , we must go into action , duty calls . - Let it call . - Show some respect for that uniform . An agent should always be ready . - I am ready ! - Will you be serious ! - Leave me alone . Who 's that ? Ciccio ! A Chinese man . - Who , him ? Just a tourist . - He looks Chinese . - Come on , let 's go . - Where to ? - Let 's go , he 's watching us . - Is someone watching ? Hey , where are you going ? - Stop . - What is it ? - I think we 're being followed . - The Chinese man ? Chinese or not , we have to confront him . You remember our instructions ? - Of course , Orsa Major force . - Show me . The Chinese man , not me . - Alright ! - Let 's hide . - You hide me , I 'll hide you . Come on . Hear anything ? We must use our ears . Your ears ! Can you hear anything ? - Chinese footsteps . - What shall we do ? - We need a plan . Which one ? - Plan 5 time 8 is 24 . - Fine . Let 's move . Careful . Be careful . He 's coming . Let 's hide . Well done . Mission accomplished . But ... - What is it ? - I thought he was Chinese ? - Must be plastic surgery . True , the Chinese are masters of disguise . In or out of disguise , he 's still Chinese . - The countdown 's over , time to go . - Let 's move . After you . It 's 7 : 30 . Next time you 're late , you can find another job . - It 's the Chinese man 's fault . - Quiet . Guests are coming . - Good evening . - Welcome . - Thank you . - The ladies ' coat , please . - A world of luxury we 'll never know . - We won 't be doormen for ever . That 's why we 're taking classes in espionage . Once we get that diploma , we 'll be able to say we 're in the FBA . Kidnapping , extortion , secret formulas , Chinese spies ... We 'll know all about it ! - Women too ! Women have a secret passion for secret agents . - How do you know ? - Study . Watch the movies . By the way , our fourth lesson has arrived . - You didn 't tell me . What does it say ? - Let me see . This is a curate 's pen . - A what ? - Black curate , it 's poison . - You mean curare . - You just press this button , and ... - Careful . You could kill me . Isn 't there a manual with it ? - Sure , here it is . But I can 't read it . - Why not ? I forgot my glasses . To have curare delivered to you , send another 10,000 lire enclosing a valid prescription . Here I am , Dr Golfoot , just as you ordered . - Well done Fong . - The general will be here soon . We will observe him closely . - She 's the cloakroom girl . - No , not at all ! She 's a copy . Your job is to take care of the real one . This way my dear . That 's right , this way . Let 's go . Careful with the pen , it 's dangerous . More guests . Welcome . - Good evening . Thank you . She didn 't feel a thing ! Where are you going ? I 'm sorry . Welcome , thank you . Thank you . - What have I done ? - I can 't die by the pen ! The Chinese guy ! Stop it . Let me . For you , for me ? For him ! - The manager ! - Mission accomplished . Retreat ! This man is dangerous , we must interrogate him . He has to talk . - I don 't think that 's likely . He 's faking ! We 're smarter than he is . We 'll tie him up and question him after our shift . Good idea . Even unconscious , he 's still Chinese . Thank you . Do it now . Quick , hurry up . Time to go to work . This one 's so angry , I think he 's going to explode . I told you ! This is pseudo-acrylic acid . Dr Golfoot 's favourite explosive . - Who is this Coldfeet ? - The most evil man alive . A heartless killer , who 's already tried to take over the world . Sure . That explosion obviously drove you mad . I have to contact Colonel Benson of the SIC at once . - Hurry up , untie me . - Who 's SIC ? - Security Intelligence Command . - He 's a secret agent ! Secret agent ? How do we know he isn 't Chinese , disguised as an American , so we think he 's an American and not Chinese so we don 't know he 's an agent ! True ! I hadn 't thought of that . Where 's your identification ? - In my wallet . Back pocket . - With your permission . Here . It 's horrible ! - What does it say ? - I 've forgotten my glasses , read it . - It 's true ! Bill Dexter , secret agent . - Like us ! Wait . Mr Agent , please ! Take us with you ! We 'll make a good impression . It 's not easy being a secret agent . You need bravery , intelligence . You need to speak four foreign languages . That 's me ! I 've studied languages . I know dialects from Palermo , Catania , Syracuse , everywhere ! Know why he doesn 't speak Chinese ? He 's never studied it . He 's great with disguises . Do you remember Fregoli ? He 's even better than him . Show him what you can do . Here I go . Attention please . Transformation ! He 's good , isn 't he ? The boss will be giving you a few tips . Pay attention . They 'll be of great use . - This is it . Young students , you are studying to be secret agents and to take on secret missions ... - Ask who that is . Who is that ? He 's Colonel Benson . He runs SIC , and is an old friend . I didn 't understand . And I say again , the future of the world depends on you ... He 's very good , we 've worked together many times . One moment . Hello there ! - Oh , it 's you . Still here ? I thought you 'd been fired . Colonel , it 's urgent . I must speak with you privately . I can prove that Dr Gold foot has ... - Speak up man ! It 's rude to whisper in front of others . He 's still alive ! Dr Goldfoot ? Wait in my office . I 'll meet you there when I 've finished . Now pay close attention . Is that a secret sign ? Head down to personnel , they 'll take all your details . Here are your data cards . Pin them to your jackets . - I 'd give anything to have one . - Are they hard to get ? Practically impossible . These are for you . Students ! Attention ! One , two , one , two . We 're in ! - What do you want , Bill ? - Four NATO generals have been killed ... One was blown up this evening , I was right there ! I 've heard , but I don 't see where you fit in . You no longer work for SIC . You like the ladies too much . I saw Goldfoot in the same place that the general died . Your imagining things . I 'm not , colonel . Is this what you came to tell me ? Yes sir , exactly . It 's sad , Bill . You 'd do anything to get back into the agency . You 'd even invent a story about Goldfoot being alive . That won 't fool me , do you hear ? Are you mad ? This is a direct line to the president . Hallo ? Yes , Mr President , it 's me . About the generals ? Bombs ? Surely , it 's just a coincidence ? Yes , sir . We 're doing all that we can . Yes , sir . Even the impossible . Yes , president . The impossible . As you wish . I 'm going to see my little friends , it 's their breakfast time . How are we today , little fishes ? Are you hungry ? I 've got a nice steak for you , the way you like it . Rare . Come on , boys . Throw it in . What ? Thirty seconds ? That 's not good enough . We 'll have to starve them for longer ! I want them to eat that much in the standard time , 25 seconds . Please , come in . Please , have a seat . Gentlemen , this is ... perhaps I should read this . This meeting is top secret . This room is completely secure . Here , we 're safe ... from microphones , recorders , and cunning spies . No-one can observe us or eavesdrop . Please turn your attention to this map . There have been bombings in all the NATO capitals , the targets were all generals involved in maneuvers this June . Is there a link between these events ? If there is , our Secret Service will discover it . As you know , we have hundreds of highly trained men The results of years of training . Highly efficient operatives , ready for anything . However , there should not be human error in selecting agents . I can make a mistake , but Rita cannot . - Who is Rita ? - Rita is IBM 's latest computer , The pride of your industries . Right . Miss Rosanna , after you . Gentlemen , this is Rita . Rita , meet these gentlemen . Data cards for all our agents ... have already been added to her memory . In a few seconds , Rita will select ... their various skills and abilities ... deciding automatically the best agent for the job . May I ? I 'd like to press a button . This one . - Of course . Gentlemen , we make mistakes , but machines don 't . That 's what he thinks ! Done ! Right , let 's see . 477 and 478 . - You 're here too ? - That 's right . There 's lots of great stuff here . I 've heard this is great . Have you tried it ? I prefer something a little lighter . A grenade with a short fuse . - The kind I like to use ! Would you pass me a Breda - Which type ? Why , a Breda . - You 're shameless . - I 'll take an 84 . - With pleasure . What nature creates , Ciccio takes . - Oh , very good ! Now that 's a gun ! TNT ! My secret ingredient . Sicilian gelatine . Pistachio flavour ! Delicious , try some . I 'm so sorry ! Commander , forgive us . Why the dark expression ? Dear chaps , my thirty year career is in your hands . To think that my future depends on you ! For a start , no weapons . - What ? Not even a machine gun ? - Nothing . Come this way . A true secret agent doesn 't use guns . The bulge in your jacket would give you away Instead ... A spy uses cunning . - Cunning ? A bit of milk never hurt . But a chop to the neck does ! We 're the best ! The wicked get no rest . Excellent ! What 's he doing ? Easy now , boss . - Secret agents ... must know how to suffer , they must be able to take pain ! - Pain ? I 've fought with an octopus , I can handle a hippopotamus . - What hippopotamus ? - You ! Here 's my hand . That tickles ! Come on ! It 's incredible ! Fantastic ! Shake my hand ! This won 't take a second . - No photos ! - How dare you ? My camera ! Give me my camera . - Calm down . - Do you know who we are ? - No . - Lucky for you . Look who it is . Hello there ! I 'm glad I found you . Listen carefully . We must join forces . Only I can tell you ... where to find the bomber , Dr Goldfoot . - I 'd rather eat my sandwich . - Interesting . Where is he ? My investigations show that he 's renting a villa ... on the Appian Way . It has a large basement . He 's storing a lot of plastic materials . You know what that means ? - Not a clue ! - But it 's obvious . All the generals were killed by exploding plastic dummies ... that looked like real women . Dr Goldfoot makes them in that villa ! We have to stop him . - Dr Goldfoot ? Exploding women ? You 're inventing it all so you can join the FBI . - And you sound like Benson ! - He told us to speak to no-one . And above all not to trust you ! So you won 't use me on this mission ? - It 's our case , we 'll deal with it . - We 'll use ourselves ! Fine ! I 'll talk to Rosanna , she 'll convince Benson to give me the case . I 'll show you . - Go ahead ! We 've trained , you know ! We studied at the Post Office . Enough of your distractions ! - Actually , he 's right . - So why didn 't you tell him ? - The time 's not right . - I prefer The Daily News . I mean timing ! I 've memorized the map . We 'll go to the villa without him . We 'll stop him , reveal his identity and arrest him . Ciccio , compared to you , I 'm a small spy . This Bill Dexter is making me nervous . You know what ? I have to get my hands on this Rosanna . Incredible . You have a heart after all ! Don 't be ridiculous , Fong . I need her so I can duplicate her . - Trespassers in the garden . - Excellent . Those two idiots are just in time . Chun Lai , feed the piranhas . This place looks uninhabited . Seems innocent to me . - Bill said this was the place . - So either he 's wrong or we are . Do you have a hypothesis ? What are you doing ? - I left it at home . - Do you have any ideas ? Let 's look for him . Franco ! Where are you ? What are you doing ? - A water feature ! - It 's hardly the time . I mean a pool ! With water and fishes . Come and look . - Where is it ? - This way . Come on . Look , what a lovely pool ! The water 's clean too . You know what ? I 'm going to bathe . - What ? You 're mad , we 're in May . - I haven 't had a bath since last May ! - And you caught a cold . - Okay , I 'll check the water . Give me your hand . Something 's eaten my shoe ! Let me see . - Who was that ? - Another bather ? - Look ! He can 't swim , he 's drowning . Let 's help him . Come closer , reach out your hand ! Ciccio ! A swimming skeleton ! - Which way ? - Where 's the exit ? Over that wall , come on . Yikes ! The Bengal Lancers . Wait for me ! - Wait ! - We 're being shot at ! Commander ! We found the plastic villa . The villa with the plastic ! And spears that come out of the wall ! And Chinese assassins ! Carnivorous fish ! Look at my shoe ! What should we do ? Maybe Bill was right . Red alert ! Prepare all agents . Go ! I hope to God for your sakes that you 're right . - Hallo ? - Road block seven here , Military vehicles are on their way , should we open fire ? No , let them pass . Plan four B. SALVATION COLLEGE Halt ! Just a moment ! I 'm in charge , I 'll shout ' halt ' ! Company , halt ! Careful ! Prepare to attack . Is this the villa ? It looks like a college to me . - Excuse me . - Take a break girls . Good morning general . - Good morning Mother Superior - To what do we owe this honour ? - We 'd like to visit the villa . By all means . From their clothes , I 'd say these men are archeologists . If they 're interested in classic figures ... Not those figures . The ones up there . One of the oldest buildings here , it 's from the 11th century . Are you here to enroll a niece perhaps ? - Well , you see ... Actually , we 'd like to see your pool . That 's it ! The pool with the ... The pyramid fish . We love our little fishes . It 's not the season for swimming ... so we keep goldfish in there . The girls love to feed them . - Yeah , with human flesh ! - Don 't talk rubbish . Hush . Enough of this piranha nonsense . - Come over here , please . - He 's one of them ! - Oh , stop it . He 's the only survivor from a Chinese convent . He was the gardener . When the convent was destroyed , he survived for 6 months eating swans . Would you get in the pool , dear ? - No ! - Go on . - Why won 't he get in the pool ? - Quiet . Behave ! Don 't worry , I put the fish in the bath . Go on ! - You see ? - Poor man . Go on , get in . Don 't do it ! Listen to me . They 'll eat him ! Be careful ! - They 're not eating him . - They 've become vegetarian . I don 't get it . - Don 't be ridiculous . Pity the Nuremberg trials are over , I 'd have you hanged . - Such a pity . - Silly boys ! Perhaps you 'd like to watch a gymnastics display by my girls . They 're very good ! Pass me the ball . Excuse me . What is it ? - Everything alright , sir ? - Get everyone ready to leave . - False alarm . - Yes , sir . - Something 's not right . - Definitely suspect . - Follow me , don 't act suspicious . - They mustn 't suspect . Very good . I 'm not fooled by this college scam . If we don 't find something , the boss is going to fire us . What was that ? No noise ! Stop dancing ! This isn 't a wedding . - What 's up ? - Come here . What is it ? - An opening - On the left ? - No , in mid-field ! - Shall we look ? - Let 's look . A red light ! Let 's take a look . - Watch it ! - You watch it ! - Who 's that ? - Someone in a hurry for a bath . A dead China-man ! This place is a cemetery ! Oh , general , you 're too kind . - Colonel ! - Who 's that ? - We 've got proof ! It 's proved . Proven ! - Enough of this . I 'm not interested . Let 's go . - The fish ! Don 't go ! They 're closing the gates . They 've closed them . They 're coming towards us . Run ! Take them to the strongroom . No-one 's following us . At least we got out of that horrible dark cell . Stop pushing . We gave them the slip . - Stop turning around - Follow me , stay close . Where are we ? We 're moving like a mad crab . Big scales , little scales , capsules , jars It 's all mechanical . What is this ? I want to know what they 're making in this college . - Let 's see . Ciccio ! - What is it ? Look at all the lovely women ! - What women , are you mad ? - They 're beautiful , I can see them ! - Come on . Follow me . - Where to ? - We have to get this rope off . - Forget that , I want the girls ! We 'll use this handle . Rub against it . Stop it ! - Wait ! Look ! Look , she 's got green eyes . She 's coming this way ! - Command me , master - A ham sandwich . - What ? Untie this rope . Ciccio , there 's more . Still more ! Where are they coming from ? They 're so beautiful . It 's like being in a doll factory . - A supermarket . - Gather round girls . We 're right here . - Easy now . We 're two red-blooded Sicilians . Finally , we 're free . - Right let 's get out of here . What ? Are you mad ? I 'm staying here to enjoy these natural splendors ! I 'm going to marry the lot . Do you all know how to cook ? Yes ! We can cook , knit and dance . - They even dance ! - We can 't , we 're on duty . Duty ? I 'm on leave . Let 's dance ! Would you look at all these women ! We 're the luckiest men alive . Look ! It 's incredible ! Just look at them ! What 's going on here ? What is this ? - It 's Goldfoot - I don 't care ! - Control yourselves ! Stop this ! - Let 's blend in . The party pooper 's here . Even machines have bad days . It 's a trick ! Spies in the lab ! Emergency ! They 've kidnapped Rosanna . There was a duplicate at her house . Goldfoot was trying to blow me up . Did you see her in there ? - I don 't know a Rosanna . - And Ciccio ? I don 't know anyone called Ciccio . I 'm not going back in there ! Go and call the police . - What are you talking about ? - I 'm scared . There 's only two of us ! Why risk it ? I don 't know anything . Dear general Willis , you 're the last one alive , for now . Do you want to know why ? - B-b-b-bec .. - Because I need to study you in detail . Every gesture and mannerism if I 'm to make good use ... of our physical similarity , so I can take your place . W-W-what do you intend to do ? V-v-v ... very simple . I 'm taking your place as Air Force commander . Y-y-you can 't ! R-r-release me at once ! You 'll regret this ! I 'll h-h-have you shot like a d-dog ! - Your command ? - I only clicked my fingers . Your fingers speak . How may I serve you ? Your target is in here . Caged . Take care of him at once . That 's right . Good girl . Only use half your explosive charge while were in here . Go ahead . - Oh Willis ! - But I 'm a married man . Command me , master . Listen carefully . I order you to stay here . Kill any living creature that enters . - Kill any living creature . - I leave you to your fate . Let 's go . Kill all living creatures . A beetle ! - I 'm going . - Come here . I 'm scared ! - Quiet ! - I 'm scared The trap door is in the bathroom , right ? I 'm going in . Watch my back . - You 're leaving me alone ? I 'll raise the alarm ! Woodworm ! - Ciccio ! You escaped . Me too ! - Tapeworm . What are you doing ? Are you crazy ? It 's me , your little Franky ! Hug me ! You 're breaking my ribs ! Killer ! Traitor ! How can you do this ? I 've known you for years . We 're brothers in arms . Don 't come any closer ! Kill all living creatures . No ! Put the bar down ! What are you doing in there ? - Rosanna ! - I 'm Ciccio . - I know , where 's Rosanna ? What did they do ? Are you frozen ? I 'll defrost you . Predatory male . Look out ! Poor Ciccio . Something must have driven him mad . Don 't worry , this is just a duplicate . - Where 's Goldfoot ? - I heard him use the secret passage . I think it 's over there , near where I was locked up . That 's it ! Come on . You wanted to kill me ! We 'll see ! - What 's happening ? - I 'll kill you like a dog . What are you doing ? Stop it ! Are you crazy ? - Want some more ? Listen ! Goldfoot 's escaped by car . We have to follow him . There 's no time to lose . Hurry up , let 's go ! - Back-stabber . I 'll show you ! - Move it ! Here they come . Quickly ! Where can they have gone ? How did they get away ? - I almost had them . - Have you got a light ? - They must be close by . - They could be anywhere . What do we do now ? - Ciccio ! It 's them ! - Get them Mr Tall Man ! Have you seen anyone go by from up there ? Sorry . No speak Italian . From giant pigmy tribe . Sorry to have bothered you . Let 's go . Quickly . This way . They didn 't notice . Hey you ! Indecent behaviour I 'd love to see their faces now . - You really want to ? - Of course . - Get off ! Who 's there ? - Let me out . - Please , wait ! You can 't park here . - What are you two doing ? Where are you going ? Come back ! Quickly , get in . - That 's a no-parking zone ! - I 'll show you . You scoundrel , come here . Let him go . - Stupid fool . Left hook , right hook . - He got away again . - He left his cloak . Here come our guys . - Quickly - Pass her to me . - There they go . - After them ! Come on , let 's ride ! Give me a steed . Take cover , they 'll get you . - I 've got cover . Get off . - What next ? We 'll get when they come round . You again ! You can 't park there ! We 'll follow them with the express . Get on board ! Stop ! They 've gone . - We 've arrived . - Oh , thanks . There they are ! Run ! No parking ! Move your car ! They took the car ! Let 's get in there , we 'll see where they 're going . I 've got you this time . Come on then ! Run away ! You cowards . Roll up folks ! Take trip in the balloon . Just a moment , pay up . - Quick , get in . Move your car ! You 're not getting away ! Stop right there . It 's full . What are you doing ? There they are ! The car 's leaving . You cheating scoundrels ! - Who 's that ? - Murderers ! Swine ! - It 's still him . Do you have any scissors ? - Sure . Here . Alone at last . Idiot ! What have you done ? - I cut the rope . - I noticed . Now what do we do ? - We can play cards . - We have to find Goldfoot . How are we supposed to steer ? - My cards ! How could you ? - How do we control this thing ? - Have you got a fan ? Hands off ! - As if that 's going to help . - Which way ? Over there ? And we 're off ! Please fasten your safety belts . " See you again , my Roman friends " . Oh , stop it . There ! He 's already taking off . He 's done it . Quick , let 's follow them . Turn the fan around . Faster ! Faster ! We 've run out of juice ! How will we catch them now . I know a short cut . Turn right , then left at the crossroads . He knows a short cut . - Are you sure ? - We might hit a typhoon . - I don 't care , I 've had my jabs . - Idiot ! It 's not a disease . - So what is it ? - It 's an Asian curry . - Bad weather 's all we need . - The barometer was wrong . We forgot to tap it ! Look . A pigeon . What 's he doing here ? Shoo ! Get lost , you stow away . - Leave him be , he 's a carrier pigeon . - How can you tell ? - Look , he 's carrying a bag . - Where ? Oh yes . Can we get you anything ? Poor little thing . The death of an innocent pigeon ! We 're losing height . We have to drop ballast . Quick . No time to waste . - Throw out anything we don 't need . - No , just the useless stuff . So what are you ? Useful ? We 're flying ! Look , the Chinese Wall ! - The Iron Curtain . Those are the Urals . You again ! - Look who it is ! - You bastards . This isn 't over ! In a balloon ! Against the traffic ! Stay here ! Forever ! It 's what you deserve . I 'll be waiting for you . You 'll be seeing me again soon . After this cloud , there 's a bend . We 'll wait for Goldfoot there . - How do you know all this ? - Oh , it 's nothing ! Stop ! Look ! There 's the plane . - Duck . - Right , let 's open the valves . Who is it ? - Friends . - Friends , that 's nice ! Just a moment . Quick ! Quickly ! Get off me will you ? I 'm a contortionist . Let go of my foot ! - Help . Somebody help me ! That should do it . Here I am . It 's not working . - Allow me . My eyes ! I can 't see ! - Don 't worry , I 'll help you . This way please . Bye ! - Where 's the step ! Guess how the Chinese man died ? Don 't spoil the ending for me . Where 's the fun in that ? Farewell , my friends , farewell . I have to leave . I 've taken care of everything . The autopilot 's on . In precisely 16 minutes , the H bomb on board will hit the Kremlin . My plan will have its happy ending , as I knew it would . No-one beats Goldfoot ! Hardjob , where are you ? - Here I am ! - Dearest . You 're not Mary Poppins , but you 'll do . Come on . Let go of me . Blast ! A ghost ! We 're safe , they 've gone . - The hell we are . The controls are locked , in a few seconds , the bomb will hit Moscow . So ? We 're insured . Benson calling Willis , do you read me ? I 'm told you 're flying over Russia , have you gone mad ? Respond at once . - Benson , it 's me . - Who 's me ? - It 's Bill Dexter . - You again ! Your agents are with me . They 've done a great job . Do you want to speak to them ? If I hear from them , I 'll have another heart attack . Where is general Willis ? - Goldfoot killed him to take his place . - We 've dealt with him . - Good , but you must turn around . We can 't , the controls are locked . In eight minutes , the H bomb will hit the Kremlin . - This is terrible . - You 're telling me ! Right , I 'm sending fighter planes to shoot you down . Are you mad ? What about the bomb ? - True . Use my two agents . - That 's us . There are instructions near the bomb . Make sure you put on protective suits before you begin . Okay guys , it 's all up to you now . There 's the bomb , get down there . - Why are we wearing these suits ? - To protect you from fallout . - Are we going to fall ? I 'm scared ! - Haven 't you heard of Uranium ? Of course . It 's what the English use in salad dressings . - No , it 's a powder used in fireworks . - Get on with it . Pass me the manual . Okay , okay ! Here you are . If your bomb explodes accidentally within it 's first year , Hydrogen Ltd will be happy to provide you with a replacement . Here , you read it . - Have you completed the registration ? - Is this bomb rented ? Open panel HK carefully . Can we go now ? Slowly turn rheostat B from seven to zero . - Which one is it ? - Don 't touch ! - Okay , okay ! - I wish you 'd gone to university . - I never had the time . Be careful . We can 't afford mistakes , the bomb will drop in two minutes . - Relax ! We get it . - Are you sure that 's right ? - Stop distracting me . Carefully extract the silver contact ... next to rheostat B. Do not allow it ... to touch the red or green wires . Don 't let the thingy touch the colours . Be extra careful . It 's at this point the bomb is almost certain to go off . There ! The bomb 's disarmed ! We 're safe ! Wait ! Wait for us ! Mummy ! Hold tight ! - What are you doing ? - Don 't leave me ! I couldn 't live without you ! - We 're upside down . - Don 't move an inch ! I 'm not enjoying this at all . I have to get a grip . Hold my hand tight ! We 're going down ! Hallo , Benson ? The bomb dropped , but it didn 't go off . - Well done , Bill . - Your agents gave their lives . They sacrificed themselves for all mankind . How do we get back ? The controls don 't work . Didn 't you know the world is round ? Keep going , you 'll get back to your point of origin . Relax ! Thanks , Benson ! - Bless you . - Thanks . - Where are we ? - How should I know ? It 's freezing here . - Forty degrees in the shade . I can hear Russian . - How can you tell ? - I had a friend from France . - Look ! - Who are they ? Comrades ! Bless you . Greet them , like this . Comrades , it 's us ! We saved the whole world ! The Kremlin too . - There 's two ? - From the H bomb ! - Oh , that . Let go ! - You don 't know who I am . - This is Ciccio . - Thanks . I have relatives in high places . In 1947 , my cousin was a member of parliament . I 've always said Bill Dexter was a gifted young man . We 'll have to make him a secret agent with honors . Cheers ! The President . Everything 's in order , Mr President . It all went well . The H bomb didn 't explode . In fact , it 's buried in the snow . There will be no more mention of this incident . If the Russians learn that any old criminal can hi-jack a plane , and drop bombs on the Kremlin at will ... the diplomatic implications would be endless . Is that clear ? Of course . I understand , but ... I 've nominated our agents for the highest awards . You see ... - Cancel all that . Do you think this is the time for publicity ? - No of course not Mr President . - So this operation never happened ! We 're innocent ! We saved your lives . It 's true ! We 've nothing against you .

 Charles Ruselli . I 'm expected . Ruselli ? Do you have the time , Mr. Ruselli ? Six minutes to noon . Room 5-A , in the basement . Sorry . ( telephone ringing ) Yes . Good , and four here make ten . Uh , yesterday . Did you get ours ? Well , we go along with most of it , but we differ on two points . We don 't think there are that many of them here yet . Well , all right , but we agree there aren 't so many that they can 't be stopped . And secondly , uh ... we don 't know the time factor , either . We 're presuming we have a year at the most . We may have something to add on that . Page three ... paragraph two . Find that ? We have a fair fix on their galaxy , and when we get that down , we can tell how long it takes them to get here and then ... we start to track them . And , uh , who knows ? We may have a little fun raising Cain with themfor a change . We 'll need the computers for that . I can fly out to San Francisco the weekend of the ... 29th . He 'll need the computers the 29th . They 're available . You have them . Good . Anything else we haven 't covered ? We 'll be sending two reports to you this week- - weapons systems and internal communications . That 's a start . Anything else ? Anything else ? Nothing here . Anybody ? I 've opened the bank accounts . One here in New York and one in San Francisco . I 'll add to them as needed . It 's going to be a pleasure doing business with you , friend . We have a deal . It 's hard to believe , isn 't it ? After all this time , people like that to count on . The beginning of the end . Or the end of the beginning . Good-bye , Mr. Singeiser . Things are going to be a little different around here now . I hope so . Computers , physicists , a man like Scoville . What did they think- - they were fooling with amateurs ? Run ! Run ! ( gunfire ) NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here , that they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Carol Lynley ... Anthony Eisley ... Donald Davis ... Kent Smith ... Reese Williams . Finally it has happened . A group of people have banded together , believers who have seen , who know what David Vincent knows- - that alien beings have found their way here and that they must be destroyed . A group of believers who , by their very nature , become the aliens chief target for extinction . Can you hear me ? Who are you ? David . Where am I ? You 're in a sealed-off basement 30 feet below the ground . There 's no way out of here . What do you want ? The others . I don 't know what you 're talking about . These were found in your briefcase . " Hand weapons , models ' A , ' ' B ' and ' C ' - - " nomenclature and ballistics , " table of command , " regeneration , vulnerability to electronic detection . " There has been a great deal of research . Who are the others ? I want them all . There were only four of us . Singeiser , Farnham , Ruselli and myself . None of you are weapons experts . Somebody else prepared these reports . How many of you are there ? How many are there ? Four of us . You made a breakthrough several months ago . You began to get evidence to get people to believe your story . Powerful people , like the head of Singeiser Computers . You formed a group . We had to stop them . You had to find people who knew how to stop them . I won 't tell . Who are they , David ? Where can we find them ? Ruselli ... Ruselli ... Ruselli is dead . There are others to consider . Who are they ? Stanley Levy , HS Research , New York . James Cunningham , Holborn College . Marie Stiles , New York City . Colonel Frederic Bell , Fort Benning . Dr. Louise Havemeyer , Johns Hopkins . Samuel Leader , Los Angeles . Who else ? No more . Ruselli ... Singeiser ... Farnham ... dead now . There are only seven of us . Put him to sleep . Room eight . ( door closes ) How long will he sleep ? Until tomorrow . By then , we 'll have them all . There 's a mistake . Dr. James Cunningham died of pneumonia in 1964 . You 're sure ? I checked the registration office myself . Very well . There 's nothing more . ( knocking on door ) Professor Cunningham died in ' 64 . The names Vincent gave us were false . There 's a possibility ... There 's no possibility of anything . Colonel Frederic Bell was killed in Korea in 1952 , and there 's no record at all of any of the others- - of any of them . He gave us those names under hypnosis . They found some way to render hypnotic interrogation useless . They must , each of them , have undergone hypnosis beforehand and had a set of false names planted in their subconscious minds . They 're anticipating us , Torberg . That makes them dangerous . It must have been kind of cramped in there for you . I know how it feels . I spent three days myself in a disciplinary lockup back home . Is this where I 'm staying ? You 'll have a lot more room here . Well , it 's empty . What are you doing ? I 'm sorry I have to do this . You won 't feel a thing . It 'll just look to the world like you disappeared . It 's not that I want to do it . ( distant gunfire ) Get back . ( gunfire ) ( coughs ) Good morning . Who are you ? Oh , I 'm Lieutenant Harper , and you 're in suite 405 in Samuel Ford Military Hospital in Tulsa ... which makes you a very important patient . Carry on , Lieutenant . I hope you like the accommodations . Yeah , they 're fine . I 'm Colonel Newcomb , United States Military Intelligence . Lieutenant Harper is one of us , so you can speak freely in front of her . How did you find me ? Our men were on their way to the Singeiser plant the night you were attacked . We 'd been keeping a tag on him for some time . Why ? We were his liaison on the new missile guidance system . He had spoken to me about the aliens . I was worried about him ... for the wrong reasons . You probably thought he was losing his mind . I was convinced of it . We hoped the aberrations would be temporary . If I had believed him , he ... might be alive now . Well , you seem to be taking it well enough . I accept my responsibility . Why didn 't your men intervene when we were being attacked ? We did , but we arrived too late . Sergeant Bryant was killed immediately . Sergeant Kilmer gave us a description of the car before he died . ( sighs ) I 'm sorry . I never even said thank you . There 's no need for thanks . The important thing is the safety of the group . I have enough reason to believe now that they 're all in danger . We have to collect the others and put all of you under direct protection . Before you do that , uh ... will you raise that blind ? I 'd like to see the sunlight . You 've been away from the sunlight for three days . Dr. Cortlandt wants the exposure to be gradual . Is that really why you won 't raise the blind ? Is it really ? ( syringe clatters ) Mr. Vincent . What 's the matter , Lieutenant ? I can 't find a pulse . Why is that ? All right , get out . There 's no way out of here for you , Mr. Vincent . * You 're the new prisoner , aren 't you ? No , I 'm a houseguest . Meet me later in the library . What do you want there ? The testing files . I 'm doing research for Dr. Torberg . The material must be used in here . I understand . When you 're finished with that , ring for someone to open the file for you . Yes . Have you been here for long ? Five or six days . I 'm not sure . I would have made contact before but I just found out about you . We 've got to get out of here . Who are you ? My name is Elyse Reynolds . You 're David Vincent . I 've seen your name in the files . You 're scheduled to run through some tests that I work on . I 'm a psychologist . Why did they bring you here ? They needed me . I was doing work in an area that was of some interest to them . I 've been here for nearly three months . Can 't help you . No , you must . You have to . They 're planning something , and we 've got to stop it . Look , listen to me . They brought me here because I 'm a psychologist . I was working in the field of crowd behavior- - mass responses to disasters . They plan to attack the cities by starting fires and floods and power breakdowns . Look , they 're going to cut the leaders off from contact with the people . They 're planning to start it in Los Angeles a week from tomorrow , and if they succeed , they 'll have a way of turning every major city into a panic-stricken mob . Sorry . Don 't you understand what I 'm trying to tell you ? Just tell your commander to stop wasting his time . Are you insane ? Do you think I 'm one of them ? ! They don 't bleed . Or maybe you don 't know that . Satisfied ? There 's no way out of here . Yes , there is . Corridor pass . Yes . Well , I know it 's here . Oh , here it is . This is the wrong pass . Oh , well , I 'll see if I can find another one . Just a moment . I want the corridor pass . Yes . No , over there . ( alarm blaring ) ( alarm continues blaring ) Whatever you can find out , Ed . She said it happened about three months ago . Done . Now , we have a company suite at the Stanton . Stay there . Who are you going to call first ? Hellman . Good . I 'll send Bob and Mary out . They can help in Sacramento . And this time , take care of yourself , will you ? You , too . I 'll get back to you tomorrow . David ? I thought I recognized those two men . Hotel Stanton . David ! Make a left turn . That 's headed for the freight terminal . I don 't care . Make a left turn . Now , there 's a car following us . You 'll have to lose him . Just what I need . ( tires screeching ) ( tires screeching ) All right , let us off around the next corner and then head for a police station . They see we 're not with you , they 'll let you alone . What 's the matter ? We 're going to have to split up . Why ? It 's too dangerous for you . But they 're looking for me , too . I know about them , too . What is it , David ? Do you still think I 'm one of them ? I know you 're not . Then why don 't you trust me ? It 's not a matter of trust . Well , what is it , then ? I have a job to do : stopping them . It 's all I live for . Do you understand ? But I can help you . I don 't want your help . I can 't afford to worry about what happens to you . Listen to me . I 'm not a fragile china doll . I lived among them for three months . Before that , I never needed anybody to take care of me or look after me . I have no one to worry about and no place to go . Don 't you have a family ? No . Well ... when I was a child , I had a ... I had a brother . I used to take care of him . I raised him ... till he died . So ... it doesn 't matter much what happens to me or you . Tell me about their plan . They 've compiled a list of over 300 key officials : the mayor , the chief of police . People whose daily orders keep a city running . On the day of attack , they plan to kill as many as they can . Other units will be sent out to immobilize the communications and power systems . According to the research we 've done , the hour after the blackout is the most critical . Having heard nothing from their leaders- - no news , no communications- - people begin to panic . The aliens plan to broadcast a message across all channels , saying that a major earthquake has developed along the fault line and that people should evacuate as ... well ... whatever way they can . Mass murder . Yeah . What can you do about it ? There 's a group ... there are seven of us now working against the aliens . They know about us . They killed three of us the night they captured me . I 'll take you to meet them . Better get some sleep . Hello . Hello . Well , come in . Glad to see you . David . Professor Hellman . Elyse Reynolds . Hello . How do you do ? Make yourself at home . Sit down . You 'll forgive me for not getting up to greet you but you see , my daughter insists that I am an invalid and that I must take care not to injure my heart . Well , it 's an honor to meet you , Professor Hellman . Well , thank you very much . I would rather it was a pleasure than an honor , but an old man , I suppose , must accept whatever compliments are forthcoming . How are you , David ? Fine . I was sorry I could not be at your meeting . You heard about Singeiser and the rest . Yes , I heard . You were careless , all of you . You cannot afford to be careless . Miss Reynolds , understand this : Your life does not belong to you now . I understand . Now , what about this planned assault ? Well , I made some notes . There are a few pages missing . I hope they make sense . Mm-hmm . Now , where and when are they going to try this ? Here in Los Angeles in five days . Five days ? Well , I 'll have to study this , but from what you told me , we should be able to neutralize the assault by protecting our central communication points and the key officials . That is , if they will believe us . Now , I 'll contact the mayor 's office tomorrow after I 've worked out a proposal . This is a lot of work for a man in your condition . Undoubtedly , but we cannot take the chance of involving more of us than is necessary . I , I believe you 'd better go now , and I 'll call you tomorrow . Good-bye . Good-bye . Bye , David . So long . Oh , take care of each other . ( sighs ) What kind of psychologist were you ? Clinical . I worked in a veteran 's hospital . Combat stress , war cases . You know , adjustment to disability . What made you choose that line ? Oh , the work was there to be done . I would have thought you 'd be interested in children . Now , why would you think that ? You said you raised your brother . Yeah . I raised him . What about it ? When did he die ? Three months ago . The aliens killed him . How did it happen ? We were out driving in the car . He was 16 . Just got his driver 's license . And there was a turn on the road . We had to stop because somebody had set up barricades . Then some people ... so we thought ... came up to us . There was something strange about them . I don 't know what happened . Next thing I knew , we got hit . Charlie got hit . Charlie got hurt ... badly . So ... they left him there ... ( crying ) : ... to die . They didn 't need him anymore . ( ringing ) Yes . When ? All right , all right . David , what happened ? They found Hellman dead . Had a heart attack . I , uh ... I guess we 'll have to start from the beginning . ( knock at door ) Hello , Bob . Hello , David . Mary . Hello . This is Elyse Reynolds . She 'll be working with us . How do you do ? Glad to know you . This is Mary and Bob Torin . Shall we sit down ? Mm . What 's it all about ? Mass hysteria . Panic . Supposed to start in LA . Elyse has a rundown . We 've got to hurt them , David . I suppose you 're upset about Hellman . What do you think ? I loved that old goat . DAVID : I know . Did your postgraduate work with him , didn 't you ? Yeah . Let 's get started . Right . I 've got a couple of friends in Sacramento . From what Scoville told us , I think we go with everything . Fine . Mary , you go to Sacramento tomorrow and tell Olsen we need his help with the governor . I 'll get fielding to use his contacts with the civil defense office . That should give us a running jump . I don 't think we 'll strike out there , but if we do , there 's three more days to try something else . Now , is there anything you need to know ? Uh , anything Scoville didn 't mention ? One thing puzzles me a little . Why they should allow an outsider to have access to their research data . Well , it was a complex project , and they were short of personnel . There were only a few of them that were familiar with the data on crowd behavior . Did you work in this field before ? Well , it was my specialty . I had no idea what they were planning . Let 's get started . Well , Elyse , it 'll be good to work with you . Thank you . Good luck . Thank you . Well , good-bye . Very nice to have met you . Bye-bye . Be careful . Bye-bye . Bye . ( gunshots ) ELYSE : David ! Come on , Elyse ! ( gunshots continue ) ( sobbing ) Room 136- - an emergency . Get an ambulance right away . Bob , there 'll be a doctor here , but we can 't wait . Let 's go . If you say it checks out , it checks out . I 've already sent you the clippings . Is Torin going to make it ? The doctors think so . I hate this . We keep setting it up , SCOVILLE ( on phone ) : they keep knocking it down . You 'll have to call Jensen now . Jensen ? Take care of yourself . David , who was that ? A member of the group . Dr. Jensen is going to take Mary 's place in Sacramento . But he 'll be killed . Not if he 's careful . Careful ? What if he isn 't careful ? ! What if they know He 'll just have to do about him already ? the best he can . But he 'll be killed , David . Then someone will take his place . Look , how can you talk like that ? They 're your friends ! Do you realize what we 're doing ? What we 're up against ? What 's at stake ? I don 't care what 's at stake . You 're sending people to be slaughtered . Don 't you feel anything ? What kind of a monster are you ? ! Just listen to me . If I have to , I 'll sacrifice you , too . They all knew that from the start- - Singeiser , Hellman and Mary- - they all knew it . So does Jensen , and now you know it . If you die , what 'll I do ? You 'll finish it . It 's up to you to meet Jensen . By myself ? By yourself . Tell me what to do . It 's almost daylight . Take a cab go to Fourth Street and Hopkins Avenue . On the southwest corner , there 's a phone booth . 6 : 00 a.m. , the phone will ring . You answer it . It 'll be Jensen . He 'll give you an address where you can meet him . You go there immediately and tell him everything you know . When will I see you again ? Jensen will tell you that . It 's after 5 : 00 ; you 'd better get going . ( ringing ) Hello ? MUFFLED MALE VOICE : This is Jensen . There 's an abandoned bus depot on East Williams Street between Second and Third , just 15 minutes walk from where you are . Be there at 6 : 15 exactly . Dr. Jensen ? MAN : Dr. Jensen ? ( loud clang ) Dr. Jensen ? ! What are you doing here ? Waiting for you . Where 's Dr. Jensen ? Another appointment . I 'm was supposed to meet him here . Yes , at 6 : 15 . It 's now 7 : 00 . I got tied up in traffic . You were supposed to walk . I told you on the phone it was a 15-minute walk . You told me ? That 's right . There is no Jensen . I made the phone call . Well , I ... You 've been working with them right along , haven 't you ? You sent them here to kill Jensen the way you sent them after Torin and his wife . David , listen to me . They never intended to immobilize Los Angeles Listen to me . because they 're not strong enough for that yet . So they had to find out about us and destroy us , but they couldn 't break me , so they sent you . I didn 't mean to . They told me they weren 't going to kill anybody . I had to , David . They have my brother . Your brother is dead . No , he 's alive . I lied to you ; I had to do it . They said they were going to kill him if I didn 't . When did you see him ? I think two days after they kidnapped me . I heard a recording of his voice . They said they were taking him to a base or something where ... where they 'd treat his injuries . When did you see him ? They ... they let me talk to him over the phone , and I got letters from him . Elyse , when did you see him ? I didn 't see him ! Because he 's dead . Your brother is dead . They let him die in that wreck . I don 't believe you . You 're trying to trick me . I had someone check on you and the accident and that kidnap story . It can 't be true . I know his voice . Your brother is dead . Dr. Hellman and Mary died for nothing . ( sobbing ) Vincent . HARLAND ( over speaker ) : There 's no way out of there . You haven 't got a chance . You might as well come out now . They 're here to find out about those other two that they sent . ( sobbing ) Elyse , I need your help . This is your last warning . Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't ... ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! How many of them in there ? Just Vincent . The other one didn 't show up . You can get in behind him from the other side . ( tires screeching ) ( gunshots ) ( tires screeching ) SCOVILLE : Why ? You want to atone for getting two of our people killed . No . I 'm horrified at everything that I did , but as your own psychologist told you , I didn 't do it voluntarily . If they blackmailed you once , why couldn 't they do it again ? My brother is dead . ( sighs ) They have nothing else to use on me . You want revenge . No . I want to stop them . What makes you think you 're tough enough ? I was responsible for getting your wife killed . I think if I 'm willing to come in and ask you to let me join your group , then I should really be tough enough . Say we let you . What can you do for us ? I know them . I 'm a trained psychologist , and a good one . Vincent ? Yes . If Bob says so . Torin ? But it 's got to be unanimous . It is . Thank you . NARRATOR : There are seven of them now ... believers ... aware of the presence of alien beings here , determined to destroy them . Perhaps for us , it is the end of the beginning . Perhaps for the invaders , the beginning of the end .

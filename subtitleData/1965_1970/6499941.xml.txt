Why did you speak to me in French ? French is international . I suppose it 's a waste of time asking the name of this place . As a matter of fact I thought you might be Polish , perhaps a Czech . What would poles or Czechs be doing here ? It 's very Cosmopolitan . You never know who you 'll meet next . I did tell you we 're only local . The charge is two units . Units ? Credit units .

Good day to you , too . Be seeing you . Good morning , sir . What can I do for you , then ? I 'd like a map of this area . A map ? Color or black and white ? Just a map . A map ... Map ... Ah ... Black and white . Here we are , sir . I think you 'll find that shows everything . L ... I ... I meant a larger ... Map . Only in color , sir . Much more expensive . That 's fine . Uh , that 's ...

Self-drive . No self-drive , ' only taxis . I 've tried those . Doorbell jingles ) Well , I look forward to the pleasure of your custom , sir . Be seeing you . Yes , sir ? ( Short fanfare on p.A. ) Woman : Good morning , all . It 's another beautiful day . ( Pleasant string music playing ) ( Door buzzes ) ( Door buzzes ) ( Phone beeping ) Woman : Ls your number six ? Yes . Just one moment . I have a call for you . Man : Good morning to you . I hope you slept well . Come and join me for breakfast . Number two ... the green dome . ( Bell tolls ) ( Door buzzes ) G dank , whining ) At last . Delighted to see you . ( Whirring ) Come in , come in . Do sit down . ( Whirring ) ( Chuckles ) I 'm sorry , I can never resist that . I hope you don 't mind a working breakfast . Tea or coffee ? Prisoner : Tea . Indian or China ? Either . With lemon . One or two eggs with your bacon ? Two . That will be all . Help yourself to toast . I suppose you 're wondering what you 're doing here . It had crossed my mind . What 's it all about ? ! ( Whirring ) Sit down and I 'll tell you . It 's a question of your resignation . Go on . The information in your head is priceless . I don 't think you realize what a valuable property you 've become . A man like you is worth a great deal on the open market . Who brought me here ? I know how you feel , believe me . And they have taken quite a liberty . Who are " they " ? A lot of people are curious about what lies behind your resignation . You had a brilliant career . Your record is impeccable . They want to know why you suddenly left . What people ? Now , personally , I believe your story . I do think it was a matter of principle . But , uh , what I think doesn 't really count , does it ? One has to be sure about these things . And that gives you the right to poke your nose into my private business ? ! Now , please , it 's my job to check your motive . I 've been checked ! Of course , but when a man knows as much as you do a double-check does no harm . A few details may have been missed . I don 't know who you are ... Or who you work for ... And I don 't care . I 'm leaving . Have you not yet realized there 's no way out ? Now , look , I have something that will interest you . Oh , feel free . A most important day , remember ? Getting ready to meet chambers . About to become late of the foreign office . You were hoping to persuade him to change his mind before the big boys found out . You waited and waited , but he never turned up . A nice guy , chambers and so taut . You see , there 's not much we don 't know about you but one likes to know everything . For instance , do you remember that time you arrived back from Singapore ? Change of climate , feeling a bit shaky . You were sickening for a cold . Sneezed yourself out of our camera . Deciding to take a vacation . Now , where can you go ? Ireland ? Bit too cold that time of the year . Paris ! Maybe not . What was that ? Sounded like a click . Something in the mirror ? Or was it over there ? Yes , over there , too . As I said , one likes to know everything . For instance , I had no idea you like lemon tea . The time of my birth is missing . Well , there you are . Now , let 's bring it all up to date . 4 : 31 A.M. , 19th of march , 1928 . I have nothing to say . Is that clear ? Absolutely nothing . Now , be reasonable , old boy . It 's just a matter of time . Sooner or later you 'll tell me . Sooner or later you 'll want to . Let 's make a deal . You cooperate , tell us what we want to know and this can be a very nice place . You may even be given a position of authority . I will not make any deals with you . I 've resigned . I will not be pushed , filed , stamped , indexed briefed , debriefed or numbered . My life is my own . Is it ? Yes . You won 't hold me . Won 't we ? Let me prove that we will . Come , I 'll show you . We can take this up later . Are you receiving me ? Loud and clear . Quite a beautiful place really , isn 't it ? Almost like a world on its own . I shall miss it when I 'm gone . Oh , it will grow on you . We have everything here . Water , electricity ... There 's the council building . We have our own council , democratically elected . We also use it for public meetings amateur theatricals . Fascinating . Yes , indeed . There 's the restaurant . Did you know we have our own little newspaper ? You must send me a copy . ( laughs ) You 'll be the death of me . We also have our own graveyard . But you 'd be more interested in our , uh , social club , I think . Members only , but I 'll see what I can do for you . You 're too kind . Now , if you have any problems there 's our citizen 's advice bureau . They do a marvelous job . Everybody 's very n ice . You might even meet people you know . Probably see the funny side of that . I 'm told some people even get seasick on it . What are they here for ? Saint vitus ' dance ? ( Chuckles ) I 'm glad you 've still got your sense of humor . They 're the senior citizens . Of course , they have every comfort . You see , you 're looked after here ... For as long as you live . Brilliant background . You see that old gentleman there ? Ex-admiral , excellent chess player . Hope he finds a partner . Taxi ! ( Sounding horn ) ( Brass band playing ) Woman : Good morning , all . It 's another beautiful day . Your attention , please . Here are two announcements . Ice cream is now on sale for your enjoyment . The flavor of the day is strawberry . Here is a warning . There is a possibility of light , intermittent showers later in the day . Thank you for your attention . ( Band continues playing ) Number two ( On megaphone ) : Come along , my dear fellow . Don 't be shy . Both : Beautiful day . They didn 't settle for ages . Now they wouldn 't leave for the world . You mean you brought them around to your way of thinking . They had a choice . Wait , wait ! ( Music stops ) Be still ! ( Whooshing ) No ! Stop ! No ! No ! Turn back ! ( Roaring ' ) ( Electronic whining ) Aah ... aah ... Screaming y ( whooshing , whining ) ( Band resumes playing ) What was that ? That would be telling . Woman : Calling number two . Ready for you at the labour exchange . Number two : Be right with you . Come along , my dear fellow . Bear to your left . Now straight ahead . Follow the signs . Well , how do you like it ? Charming . It will grow on you . ( Men humming ) Good morning , sir . Good morning . Go straight through . Thank you . Ah . This is our new friend . Everything 's ready , sir . Will you sit down ? Well , first of all , the aptitude test . ( Click ) ( Chuckles ) Now the questionnaire . You just fill in your race , religion , hobbies . What you like to read , what you like to eat . What you were , what you want to be . Any family illnesses . Any politics . Never mind , you can get all you need from this . I think we have a challenge . What are you doing here ? I 'm your personal maid . The labour exchange sent me . That 's another mistake they made . Get out ! ( Whirring ) ( Pleasant orchestral music playing ) ( Music continues ) ( Music grows louder ) ( Music continues playing ) Woman : Attention , electrics department . Please go to number six , where adjustment is needed . ( Music continues softly ) I forgot my ... How do you stop this thing ? ! We can 't . Why not ? It 's automatic . Who controls it ? Who runs this place ? I don 't know ! I really don 't know ! You never wondered . You never tried to find out . How long have you been here ? As long as I can remember . And your parents ? They died when I was a child . You don 't remember them ? I found out it 's wiser not to ask questions . We have a saying here . " A still tongue makes a happy life . " People must have tried to get away from here . How many have succeeded ? Don 't ask . Has anyone ever escaped ? Some have tried . They 've been brought back . Not always alive . Go on . What are you afraid of ? Nothing . ( Music concludes ) I 've said too much . What time tomorrow ? ( ﬂying ) I know what you must think of me . Put yourself into my position . They offered me my freedom in exchange . In exchange for what ? To get into your confidence , make you trust me . Then tell them everything about you . Then they 'd let you go . You believe that ? With that knowledge in your head you really believe that they 'd let you go ? I hadn 't thought about that . Obviously not . They might . They might let me go ... If you give me some sort of information . Oh , please help me . Please help me . Your services will not be required tomorrow . Don 't forget what you came back for . She was most convincing . I felt sure she was going to pull it off . He 's no ordinary man . This has got to be handled very differently . That could be dangerous . You know how important this is . ( Motor putter / fig ) Electric , sir . Sorry about the intrusion . Help yourself . Why do you drive those things ? What ? ( Music resumes ) Th e ... tractors . Steady . Get you there in the end . Bit slow . In an emergency , we walk . I , uh ... I feel like a bit of a walk myself . ( Door buzzes ) Feel free . Be seeing you . And you . Lovely day . Showers later . Careful , sir , they 're new plants . Sorry . Good-bye . ( Whining , whooshing ) ( Whooshing ) ( Roaring ' ) ( Whining ) ( Roaring ' ) Attention , post 14 . Attention , post 14 . Yellow alert .

I was in Germany . I remember going back to my hotel ... I went into the bedroom ... I think I went to bed . Well ... I was here . What are you doing out of bed ? You should be resting . There 's nothing the matter with me . Perhaps not . But I 'd just like a checkup to make sure . I 'm all right . I want to leave . Let me be the judge of that . The aftereffects can be quite unpleasant . I 'd like to put my mind at rest . Please come with me . What if I don 't ? It 's for your own good . I 'd advise you to . Very well . There 's nothing to worry about . The tests are quite routine . Group therapy . Counteracts obsessional gu I lt complexes producing neurosis . Here we are . Sit down . If I agree to this ? My dear fellow , if you 're fit there 's no reason to keep you here . Of course , if you have a relapse you may have to come back . Slippers . My size . Naturally . Now ... just relax . I 'll just listen to the old ticker ... Excuse me . No , he 's having a medical . Mm-hmm . No , of course not . No , of course I don 't mind . One has to make sure of these things . There you are . Everything 's in order . You 're absolutely fit . So ? I told you , you 're free to go in the morning . We 'll fix you up with some new clothes . What about my old ones ? They 've been burnt . Why ? I 'll take you to your ward . ( Man laughing wildly ) ( Babbling musically ) Doctor : Oh , he 's coming along nicely . ( Bell clanging ) What 's happened ? The amnesia case ... Cobb . He 's jumped out of the window . He 's dead . Here 's your employment card ... Your card of identity ... Your health and welfare card ... Your credit card ... And a free ride home . Get him ! I have taken his place . I am the new number two . Get number one . As far as you 're concerned , I 'm in charge . What can I do for you ? Cobb . What we do here has to be done . The law of survival : Them or us . You imprison people , steal their minds , destroy them . Depends on whose side your on , doesn 't it ? I 'm on our side . Then we have to find out where your sympathies lie . You know where they lie . " Subject shows great enthusiasm for his work . He is utterly devoted and loyal . " Is this a man that suddenly walks out ? And I didn 't walk out ... I resigned ! People change , exactly . So do loyalties . Not mine . All very commendable , but let 's be practical . I 'm interested in facts . Your only chance to get out of here is to give them to me . And if you don 't give them I 'll take them . It 's up to you . Think about it . Good day , number six . Number what ? Six . For official purposes , everyone has a number . Yours is number six . I am not a number . I am a person . Six of one , half a dozen of another . Good day . Report on number six .

Subject proving exceptionally difficult . But in view of his importance . No extreme measures to be used yet . ( Brass band playing ) ( Sounding horns ) ( Band continues playing ) Friend of yours ? You knew him ? No ! You 're crying . Funerals make me emotional . Even those of people you don 't know ? Yes . I knew Cobb . I 'd like to help . He 's dead . He was a friend of mine . We met ... Some time ago . How do I know I can trust you ? Can I trust you ? You know how he died ? He jumped from a window . I 'm sorry . Had you known him long ? No . Just a short while . Where did you meet ? Here ? Yes ... yes . Cobb was a good man . ( Bell tolling ) Get back , quickly . When can we talk again ? We 'd better not . We must . 12 : 00 , at the concert . ( Band playing ) Thought you weren 't coming . I want to help . How ? I know a way out . We planned an escape . But they found out . No . They came sooner than Cobb expected . He expected them ? In here , you have only so much time to give them what they want before they ... take it from you . His time had come , so will yours . Can you fly a helicopter ? I might . It 's due here at 2 : 00 .

Hurry , there 's not much time . Who gave you this ? Your boss ? What do you mean ? What were you doing in number two 's house ? You saw me ? I saw you leave ... After you 'd made your report . You 're assigned to me ? I was assigned to Cobb , too . And you 'd betray me in the same way . I haven 't betrayed either of you . We were trying to get out before it was too late ... soon it will be too late for you . You 're coming . No . Why not ? I never intended to without him . You 're coming with me . Go and go now before it 's too late . ( Whining , whooshing ) Beeping y ( beeping faster ) ( Continues beeping ) ( Engine whining ) Admiral : Game of chess , my dear ? I don 't play . You should learn . We 're all pawns , my dear . Your move . I think I 'll let him keep the watch , Cobb . Just to remind him escape is not possible . Don 't be too hard on the girl . She was most upset at my funeral . She 'll be well taken care of . Yes ... that 's what I was afraid of . Oh , well , I better be going . Got a long journey . Mustn 't keep my new masters waiting . They 'll be delighted with you . Give them our compliments . I will . And I 'll tell them there are no loopholes . I appreciate that . I do hope that your stay had its lighter moments . Au revoir . You 'll find him a tough nut to crack . A hf wiedersehen . ( Whooshing ) ( Whining ) ( Slam echoes )

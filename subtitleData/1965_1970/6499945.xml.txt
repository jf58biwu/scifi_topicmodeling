 ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) [ Captioning sponsored by ae home video ] Prisoner : Where am I ? Man : In the village . What do you want ? Information . Whose side are you on ? That would be telling . We want information . Information information ... You won 't get it . ( Bubbling ) By hook or by crook we will . Who are you ? The new number two . Who is number one ? You are number six . I am not a number , I am a free man ! ( Number two laughs fiendishly ) ( Fanfare playing ) Woman ( Over loudspeaker ) : Good morning , good morning , good morning and what a lovely day it is . Rise and shine , rise and shine ! Before our program of early-morning music here are two announcements . The long-range weather forecast is that the fine spell will continue for at least another month . Your local council ... and remember it is your local council democratically elected by you ... have decided to organize a great new competition . Can you paint ? Can you draw ? Can you model in Clay ? If you can , then your day is just six weeks today . More about this later , but now , music . He can make even the act of putting on his dressing gown appear as a gesture of defiance . There are methods we haven 't used yet , of course . I want him with a whole heart , body and soul . ( Lively music playing ) He 'll crack . Perhaps ... one tiny piece at a time . I don 't want a man of fragments ! ( Music still playing ) Fascinating . He doesn 't even bend a little . That 's why he 'll break . He only needs one small thing . If he will answer one simple question , the rest will follow : Why did he resign ? Control room . Supervisor . Have you picked up the helicopter yet ? I think it 's just in range . ( Radar beeping ) Yes . She 's on the radar now . Do you want to make radio contact ? No . But tell me when it 's due . I want to meet it . Old man : Your move , young man . Yes . Oh , know what I think I 'll do ? Resign . No , that announcement this morning : Exhibition of arts and crafts . Oh , these aren 't all they might be , you know ? I think I 'll make a chess set . Used to be quite a handyman once . Are you entering ? No . You 're a fool , number six . That 's my opinion . Really ? You 'll be here for as long as you live . However long that is . Might as well try to settle down . No point in being uncooperative . Was there ever a time when you were not cooperative ? No point in fighting battles you can 't win . You 're here of your own free will ? Oh , impudent , too , huh ? Wish I 'd had you in my regiment for a few months . Which regiment was that ? Which army ? ( Rotors whirring ) Good morning , general . The general seems a little sour . Mate in seven moves . Oh . How many do you know ? A few more . We must play sometime . ( Siren blaring ) Certainly we must , by post . Laughing ) I must add " sense of humor " to your file . They tend to leave out things like that ... very important . Number six : What crime did she commit ? Nervous tension ... that 's all . She 's come here to recuperate . How much are you charging her ? Laughing ) I really must bring your file up to date . Number two : Sit down , my dear chap . File number six , section 42 subsection six , paragraph three add : Sense of humor , strong and unimpaired . Thank you . That will be all . ( Inhales deeply ) I can never remember . One lump or two ? It 's in the file . Yes , as a matter of fact , yes . But it would save time if you just answered . Running out of time ? ( Clicks tongue ) " Does not take sugar . " Giggles ) Frightened of putting on weight ? No . Nor of being reduced . Oh , that 's excellent . I am glad you 're here . You really are a model . But I don 't run on clockwork . You will , my dear chap . You will . Do you think so ? Do you still think you can escape , number six ? I 'm going to do better than that . Oh ? Going to escape and come back . Come back ? Escape , come back wipe this place off the face of the earth ... obliterate it and you with it . Oh ! Subsection six , paragraph four , add : On the other hand , persecution complex amounting to mania . Paranoid delusions of grandeur . Don 't worry , number six . You 'll be cured . I 'll see to it . No more nightmares . If you have so much as a bad dream you will come whimpering to tell it to me . Whimpering . Watch , just watch . Why ? She 's your new neighbor , that 's all . I thought you might be interested . The new number eight . What happened to the old one ? Oh , he vacated the premises . You noticed , surely . Did he escape ? ( Laughs ) There was no funeral . That 's not always possible . You need a body . Oh , look , she 's getting up . It 's quite like old times isn 't it , number six ? Do you remember your first day ? ( Sighs ) Thank God I 'm home . An exact replica of her own room , of course . Of course . Laughing ) Number eight , please . ( Phone beeping ) ( Weakly ) : Hello ? Number two : Good morning . Quite recovered ? No ill effects from the journey , I trust . ( Voice quavering ) : Who is it ? Where am I ? There 's nothing to be afraid of , my dear . Come and have lunch with me . Number two , the green dome . ( Clicks off ) Oh , hello ? A most pleasant addition . Number eight : Hello ? I 'm sure you 'll agree . Hello ! I trust you 'll be neighborly . I 'll do a deal with you , number six . You tell me one thing and I 'll release you . Why did you resign ? Release me ? From the village ? Mm-hmm . That 's really all we want to know . And that 's not much to ask , is it ? ( Knocking ) If you insist on staying here I do hope you 'll attempt to settle down . Try to take part in community life ... this exhibition that 's coming up for example . Wait a minute . Just ... there . " At the age of 15 , top of his class in woodwork . " That 's the sort of thing I mean . Join m ! I 'll make you a handle for this door . Laughing ) You 'll be back ! Whimpering . Woman ( Over loudspeaker ) : Good morning again . Further news of the exhibition of arts and crafts . Your finance committee have decided on the prizes to be awarded . There will be five prizes according to age groups but the exhibit judged to be the best of any group will receive a special prize of 2,000 free work units . Number eight : Excuse me . I will repeat that : 2,000 ... Could you please me where number two ... The green dome is ? Oh , yes , certainly . Across the square , across the street , up the steps . You can 't miss it . I know it sounds crazy , but ... What ? I don 't know where I am . In the village . Both : Lovely day . Day . That sounds like a salute . It is . Could you take me over there , please ? To the green dome ? Yes , certainly . Across the square across the street , up the steps . You can 't miss it . Can you get a car here ? Taxis ... local service only . Where will they take you ? Anywhere you like as long as you arrive back here in the end . That 's why they 're called local . Who are these people ? Why are they here ? Why are you ? Here you are ... the green dome . Who 's number two ? Who 's number one ? ( Gasps ) Oh , I 'm frightened . Good-bye . I 've done nothing wrong ... I 've committed no crime . All I did was resign . No use telling me . Number six : Good evening . So ... long lunch ? Yes . Nightcap ? Nightcap ? Drink . There 's one good thing about this place . At least it 's cheap . Genuine nonalcoholic whiskey , 24 work units . Or would you prefer genuine nonalcoholic vodka ? 16 work units . I hope there 's nothing significant in that . Yes , I would prefer it , mister ... Uh , sorry , no name . I am number six . And you are number eight . I didn 't think it would be like this . You , um ... You Russian ? Estonian . Russian . We don 't think so . You speak very good English . It was my job . From which you resigned . Number two is a very charming man . Yes . I would expect his assistant to be the same . Do you mean me ? What about you , number eight ? I 'm no number eight , or number anything else . My name is Nadia rokovsky . And I 've been interrogated enough for one day . Good night . Be seeing you . ( People talking and playing ) ( Gulls calling ) ( Feet shuffling ) May I join you ? You 're , uh , good neighbors , I hope ? There are some people who talk and some people who don 't . Which means that there are some people who leave this place and some who do not leave . You are obviously staying . Has it ever occurred to you that you 're just as much a prisoner as I am ? ( Guffawing ) : My dear chap , of course ... I know too much . We 're both lifers . I am definitely an optimist . That 's why it doesn 't matter who number one is . It doesn 't matter which side runs the village . It 's run by one side or the other . Oh , certainly . But both sides are becoming identical . What , in fact , has been created ? An international community . A perfect blueprint for world order . When the sides facing each other realize they 're looking into a mirror they will see that this is the pattern for the future . The whole earth , as the village is . That is my hope , ' what 's yours ? I 'd like to be the first man on the moon . Laughing ) Well , must go . Delightful chat ... thank you , number six . Number two : International swimmer . At the age of 17 ( amazed ) : Olympic bronze medalist . Control room . Number two . Tell me , what visual range do you have out to sea ? Do you mean direct TV transmission ? Yes . Two Miles . After that , we 're on radar . Thank you . Control room is now ready for you . Oh , thank you ... I 'll be right there . She 'll be out of range soon . She 's kept in training , I must say . Oh , well , orange alert . ( Machine humming at high pitch ) Don 't touch her , please . We 'll take care of her . Meet me at the hospital right away , number six . Be right there . ( Birds chirping ) Man : What was the purpose of your swimming ? Were you attempting suicide ? ( Door opening ) Number two : Ah , number six . How good of you to come . I wonder if you could help me . How ? You probably got to know number eight better than anybody while she 's been here . Come with me . Look . Did you think you could escape ? Won 't say a word . I really don 't want to be hard on her . She 's not important . I 'm surprised they sent her here . What was the purpose of your swim ? Were you attempting suicide ? Have you noticed any suicidal tendencies ? What are you doing to her ? Nothing , as you can see . Oh , there 's an alternating current in the floor . Four seconds on , four seconds off . It takes just three seconds to get to the door . If she times it correctly she can leave whenever she likes . Tell us ... what was in your mind ? She 's caught on to that at last . ( Buzzing ) What was in your mind ? One ... Two ... You see , if she has any confidence one ... two ... three ... In her own timing she 's got no problem . It 's self-inflicted . What was in your mind ? What were you thinking ? Tell us . What was in your mind ? What was the purpose of your swim ? What was in your mind ? Were you attempting suicide ? Suicide ? Suicide ? What was in your mind ? One ... two ... Three ... four . I believe she 's going to do it . Yes . That 's better . Mind ? Mind ? No , switch off ... switch off ! Kill me , kill me , kill me , kill me ! ( Number eight sobbing ) Well , well . We 'll just have to try something else . ( Continues sobbing ) You sure you can 't help me ? I really find this most distasteful . Let her go . Looks like a suicidal tendency , doesn 't it ? But one must be sure . Let her go ! Is that an order number six ? All right . You wanted a deal . I 'll make a deal with you . Let her go and I 'll collaborate . You 'll what ? Isn 't that what you want ? So obvious a weakness ? In you ? Why not ? For which you 'll collaborate ? Don 't get too excited . I 'll tell you nothing . I 'll join in , try to settle down . I 'll even carve something for the exhibition . If I turn her over to you you 'll do some woodwork for me . Is that your deal ? Best you 'll get . ( Laughs ) : You really are the limit , number six . File number six . Section III-z , subsection six . New paragraph five . Overweening sense of self-importance . While here , his egomania has , if anything , increased . Well ? All right , she 's all yours . Be seeing you . ( Whistling tune ) Yes , good morning , you 're early . I 'll do those for you . Ah . One egg or two ? Two , I think . One egg or two ? Here you are . That 's so nice . Be seeing you . Things couldn 't be going better . I think I 'll pay them a call . ( Recorded march playing ) Good morning to you both . Settling down , I hope . Thank you . No swimming today , eh ? Mmm , no . Off to the woods . Naughty , naughty . To carve for the exhibition . I 've decided to do a series of abstracts . You 're not using any offensive weapons , I hope . You know the ruling about axes , saws , chisels that sort of thing . They may fall into the wrong hands . Yes , abstract art is basically primitive . I 've ... I 've made my own tools . Tip top ! Doing as the caveman did , eh , number six ? I may even invent fire . ( Laughs ) ( Gasps ) They can see us , but they can 't hear us . You can talk freely . Can I ? You still think it 's a trap . I don 't know . Were you sent here because you discovered the whereabouts of the village ? Don 't tell them that . You know where it is , don 't you ? All I know is there 's no escape . Not even by sea . You 've tried it . I was a fool . I couldn 't swim so far . How far ? To where ? ( Sighs ) : It 's no good . Isn 't it ? If I knew where I was sailing from I could calculate where I was sailing to . Sail ? By boat . Where are you going ? I must think . Keep to the paths . I say ! I say ! What is it ? It 's , uh , not finished yet . Doesn 't make sense without the whole group . There 'll be three pieces . Entries must be in two weeks tomorrow . I 'll be ready . Ax , stone chisels ... even these are outside the pale of the law , you know technically speaking . Yes , I 'm , uh ... I 'm sure you can wink a blind surveillance eye , can 't you ? My dear number six , I wouldn 't dream of interfering . I can 't tell you how delighted I am . Need a lift to the village ? Uh , no , thanks , I think I 'll carry on while there 's enough light ... a little bit more . Oh , well . Be seeing you . And you . ( Chuckles ) ( Quietly ) : Not for long . Woman : Hello and good evening . Curfew time . Sleep tight . 15 minutes from now to curfew . Meanwhile , allow us to lull you away with ... ( Guitar playing quiet ballad ) ( Doorbell buzzes ) ( Music continues ) Is it safe to talk ? Speak softly . ( Guitar music continues ) Curfew in five minutes ... ( Whispers ) : Tell me . To curfew the minutes are five . ( Music continues ) The language of love . I do know where the village is . How do you know ? I work for the government . Oh . ( Whispers ) : Which ... which government ? Well , it doesn 't matter but I saw a secret file on the village ... by accident , and for a few seconds only . Did you , um ... have access to other secret information ? Yes . Where are we , Nadia ? Lithuania . Curfew time : One minute ... Lithuania . 60 seconds . ( Music continues ) On the baltic . That means making for west Germany , Denmark . That 's 300 Miles at least . Oh , no , it doesn 't mean that . Why not ? Even nearer , in Poland ... danzig . Will you take me with you ? Will I be safe ? I can 't answer for the British authorities for either of us . Can you answer for you ? I give you my personal guarantee for whatever that 's worth . 30 Miles , that 's all . Huh ? Yes , that 's how far we are from the Polish border . Hmm . Beyond , on the coast there 's a little village : Braniewo , fisher people . They resist them . There 's a little group . I know them . I have a contact man . They 'll do anything for us once we get there . Is that where you were making for ? Oh , do you really know what I want ? To hear the chimes of big bill . And now it 's here ... Big Ben . ( Bell chiming ) It 's curfew . I 'll never call you anything else . Chiming as usual . Good night , Nadia . Good night , big Ben . Big bill . Good night . Be seeing you . ( Bell chiming ) ( Band loudly playing celebration march ) Good afternoon to you both . Will you excuse me , number eight ? Number six , I 've just come from the exhibition ... Pardon ? The awards committee are intrigued with your abstracts but they 're a little mystified . Could you give them a word ? Yes , certainly , with pleasure . Yes , I 'll be right back . Excuse us . ( Jazz music playing ) Number two : Remarkably high standard , don 't you agree ? Highly original . Ah , general , excellent . I 've seen your stuff , number six . I didn 't like it . Bound to say so . Oh , sorry to hear that . Is this your chess set ? Oh , it 's nothing , nothing . It 's very good . Yes , I quite like the king , I must confess . The king ? ( Chuckles ) : Yes , yes . First class . I 'm glad to see you 're settling down , by the way . Thank you . Thank you very much . And here he is , our very own Epstein . Can I help you ? We 're not quite sure what it means . It means what it is . Brilliant : " It means what it is . " Brilliant ! Oh , no . You mustn 't let me influence you , ' you are the awards committee . What puzzled me , number six , was the fact that you 'd given the group a title : Escape . This piece ... What does it represent to you ? A church door ? Right first time . I think I see what he 's getting at . Yes , this other piece here about the same general line somewhat more abstract , as you 'll notice representing freedom or a barrier depending how you look at it . The barrier 's down , the door is open . You 're free , free to go , free to escape ... to escape to this ... The symbol to human aspirations : Knowledge , freedom , escape . Why the crosspiece ? Why not ? Good , splendid . I was really quite worried for a moment . The only thing I don 't understand ... Yes . Where is number two ? ( Applause ) And now ... and now the special prize for the over-60 group . And this goes ... for her magnificent tapestry ... to number 38 ! ( Applause ) Well done , 38 . ( Chuckles ) And now ... and now the prize of prizes the special merit award of 2,000 work units for the best work in any of the five groups . And the committee have awarded it to ... number six ! Speech , my dear chap . Pardon ? Speech . Right , sir . Um , ladies and gentlemen ... Uh , fellow citizens um , my work is its own satisfaction . Spoken like a true artist . I am , however , deeply honored by this award . I feel nevertheless that it should have gone not to me but to someone whose work , long life in this village has been an example to us all . Number 38 . Oh ! It 's not for me to reverse the decision of the committee however , I would like to use these 2,000 work units to buy number 38 's work to hang in my own home . Agreed ? Bravo ! Bravo ! ( Applause drowns out voices ) ( Band plays festive march ) Bravo ! Bravo ! ( Music and applause drown out dialogue ) Thank you very much , sir . Oh , very good , yes . Woman : Good morning , good morning , good morning ! And what a lovely day it is again . Rise and shine , rise and shine ! First , your weather . It will be hot and fine all day though the fresh breeze will continue ... How much further ? About two Miles . If your geography 's correct , just around the next headland . Calling number two , calling number two . There ... almost out of range . 30 Miles , eh ? Better contact post five just in case and then orange alert . Orange alert . Orange alert . That 's it ! See the cave ? We 're catching a crosswind from the rocks . Look ! Swim for it . Swim for it ! ( Gunfire ) ( Gunfire ) Nadia ! Ya zhdal tebya ... ya dumal chto Ty ne priyedesh ' . Ya tozhe . Number six : Pencil ... Paper . U tebya yest bumaga I karandash , pozhaluysta ? Tebye mozhne pomoch' nas seychas , zhe ? ID ! So mnoy , bystro . Ask him to transmit this to London immediately . He will not ... Peredayte k London seychas . He will not understand it . It is in code . It is a delivery note . Seychas peredayte . Khorosho . What route are we taking ? Kak my yedem tuda ? Ah , I understand . By sea , gdansk , danzig , you know by air to Copenhagen by air again to London . Quick now , please . His watch ... ask him for his watch . Chasy , davay chasy skoree . This , this no good . Seawater ... no good , your watch . Ah . Oni popali v vodu . What now ? Quick now ... Please ! Big Ben ? What ? I just wanted to hear your voice . I don 't chime . The chimes should occur in about 12 hours ' time . Big Ben ? ( Groans ) Yeah ? I feel a bit sick . It 's all right . Hold out . It 's only another ... Three hours at sea . Big Ben ? Yeah ? Have you got a wife in england ? No . Don 't talk any more . Big Ben ? Yes ? I feel a bit better . That 's great . That 's ... Marvelous . Wonderful . Good night . ( Phone rings ) Fotheringay here . Yes ? Yes , I 've seen a copy of the deciphered message . What time would you say ? Good . I daresay I can 't wait to see him ! If that was ... If that was Copenhagen it 's less than ... less than an hour and a half to go . Big Ben ? Yeah ? Where are we going to land in england ? I don 't know . If my message was received correctly we 'll land in an office that I shall know very well , in London . Big Ben ? Yeah ? Are you engaged to someone ? I mean , is that the right word : " Engaged " ? Go to sleep . Man : Stone the crows , this one 's a weight ! You two take that side . Watch it now . It 's supposed to be fragile ! Good evening , colonel . Evening , fotheringay . Well , everything 's gone according to schedule . Our friend will be with us any minute . Right , get it open . Colonel . All right ? Fotheringay . Hello , old man . Allow me to introduce you to Nadia . How do you do , my dear ? Right then , perhaps you would leave us to it , old chap . Well , see you later , I hope . I certainly hope so , foth er I ngay . ( Big Ben chiming ) I-is ... are we there ? Shh . ( Bells chiming ) Is that it ? Shh . ( Bells chiming ) Yeah ... That 's it . Perhaps you wouldn 't mind waiting in the other room , my dear . Peters . It 's all right . Go with them . See you later . Well ... The return of the prodigal son . I don 't see any fatted calf . Did you expect one ? No . Tell me , who 's she ? Nadia rokovsky . Oh , really ? And what was her name before she left peckham rye to train for the bolshoi ballet ? You haven 't changed , have you ? She told me she was an Estonian . In the village ... The village ? She was known as number eight . Don 't you know about the village ? I 'm here to ask the questions , old boy . That 's what number two used to say . Number two ? Chairman of the village . What village ? Oh , yes , I forgot . You don 't know , do you ? The village is a place where people turn up ... people who have resigned from a certain sort of job have defected or have been extracted . The specialized knowledge in their heads is of great value to one side or the other . Are you sure you haven 't got a village here ? Where is this village ? Lithuania on the baltic , 30 Miles from the Polish border . How did you find out ? Nadia told me . How did she know ? She used to work for their government . She came across a secret file . On how to catch a spy in six lessons ? I risked my life and hers to come back here , home because I thought it was different . It is , isn 't it ... Different ? ! My dear chap I do apologize . You 've had a long journey . You must be exhausted . Here , I expect you could do with a decent drink . Scotch ? 24 work units . What ? That 's how much it cost in the village . Ah , yes ... the village . Surely you know about it . All I know , old boy , is that you resigned from a post of the highest possible secrecy refused to give your reasons and then promptly vanished . I was kidnapped . Oh , really ? How dramatic ! And then , after a gap of months we suddenly receive a suitably coded message that you 're coming back from the other side of the iron curtain ! You think I 've gone over ? And come back here to carry on the good work . No . " No , " he says , " no . " Nyet . Nyet . What sort of imbeciles do you think we are ? ( Bells chiming ) ( Big Ben continues chiming ) All right . What do you want me to do ? Quite a lot of things . But let 's start at square one first , shall we ? First , why did you resign ? It was a matter of conscience . Oh , listen , Sonny boy . ( Bell strikes the hour ) Do you think you 're safe in London ? If they thought it worth kidnapping you it 's worth killing you . I doubt if you 'll be alive 24 hours after you leave this building unless you get protection . Do you want it ? For the girl as well . If you come across with the goodies , yes . Political asylum guaranteed for the girl . Well , that depends . It depends , nothing ... it 's guaranteed ! All right , so long as you keep your part of the bargain . All right . Right ' - question one : Why did you resign ? ( Bell continues striking the hour ) I resigned ... Because for a very long time , this ... Just a minute . ( Horn beeps ) It 's 8 : 00 . That 's right . The night is young , and there are many questions . First , why did you resign ? Big Ben has just struck 8 : 00 . My watch says 8 : 00 . So ? I was given this watch by a man in Poland . I particularly wanted it to check the time to make sure that the trip ... tallied with a journey to London . Which it presumably did . Yes , of course . Would you like to explain to me how a man in Poland came to have a watch showing English time when there 's one hour 's difference ? ! Maybe he was slow . I 'll bet he was . ( Horns beeping ) ( Car horn blaring loudly ) ( Traffic sounds stop abruptly ) ( Traffic sounds start again ) ( Typical village music plays ) Well done , fotheringay . Well , you 'd better get back to London before any embarrassing questions are asked . What 's my next assignment ? The colonel will give you your orders when he returns . Be seeing you . Woman : Good evening , citizens . Your local council wishes to announce another exciting competition . The subject this time : Sea escapes . File for six , section 42 subsection one , paragraph one : Back to the beginning . You were right about him . I told you . Don 't worry . It was a good idea , and you did your best . I 'll stress it in my report . ( Loud slam echoes ) [ Captioned by the caption center wgbh educational foundation ]

 Has he come to ? Want to see him ? Will he live ? Can 't tell yet . I 'd have called you . Is he dead ? No , but still unconscious . Three days already ... If he could be moved we could use him now . Could you keep anyone alive like that ? The experiment will kill him . We need a healthy man . There he is . Will you talk to him ? I 'd rather wait . Has he seen anyone ? Doesn 't want to . Why not pick one of your men ? They didn 't fit . But why him ? He has nothing to lose . Why not pick a convict ? We thought of that . Has he chances of coming back ? There is no knowing it . I 'd like to meet him . I 'll call you . You forgot your things . I won 't need them . Claude Ridder ? Could you spare a day ? We 're no policemen . I 'm from Crespel Research Center . Never heard of it . Nobody has . I 'd like to take you there . Is it far ? 50 km . we have a car . How 's the weather ? Sunny . Then why not . Want to go by your house ? Am I the man you want ? This is no kidnapping . You 'd get no ransom . Is Crespel a town ? Not yet . Is it pretty ? Not very . Are you tired ? Of that question , yes . They treated you well ? Why am I so interesting ? Can you smoke ? Cancer is my only worry . Glad to be alive ? I 'm not alive . We 're approaching . You don 't seem to care ? I 've seen so many things . Other may happen . Like in fairy tales ? It isn 't pretty . But it 's interesting . I thought Crespel was a town . There is one 3 miles away . The boss will see you . Surprised ? Frankly , yes . We are supposed to do agricultural tests . Actually we study time . Have you solved it ? Partly . Where do I intervene ? I have a question ... Answer it if you like . You attempted suicide ... Has your mind changed ? Not for the moment . You 'd do it again ? I see . You want me as the ideal guinea pig . Would have I chances of surviving ? 100 % if you were a mouse . Let me show you . Time passing ? I loved your idea of an agency ... to distribute time . It wouldn 't work . Time might break down . Nothing like writers to have farfetched ideas . Here are mice A and B. Are they alike ? Is one a female ? Both are males . B is a pioneer . A has never traveled . B lived for one minute in the past . A hero . When ? Yesterday . With no ill effects . How do you know it really happened ? That 's the problem . He can 't tell us . You should have taught him to talk first . You 'll go back one year . ... into your past . For one minute . What if it kills me ? It won 't with our treatment . Where were you a year ago ? On vacation . It took 3 months on the Riviera . Are you sure ? I never forget vacations . You 'll be in a sphere . At your return you 'll wait for 4 minutes . Why ? You 'll be like a diver in a decompression chamber Are you interested ? Why the past ? ... instead of the future ? I see your point ... But we can 't go further for the moment . Only short trips . Not even a little ulcer ? You 're quite healthy . Suicide is good for me . I 'll have to keep you here . On a diet ? Sort of . For 4 days . Will I have to sign a release before the experiment ? Possibly . You could say I died in the hospital . No doubt . That 's clever . Was it your first suicide ? With a gun ? Guns don 't fit you . That 's why I missed . You are not afraid ? I 've feared all my life . But now I don 't . Do you sleep well ? No headaches ? Mind the effects of T. 5 . Doesn 't seem to hurt you . Now we just have to wait . What if I stay for years ? It will last exactly 60 seconds . Even mice can tell . I won 't wake up under Nero ? Lie down . We 'll close the door . You 'll come back here one minute later . Disappointed ? A bit . What if it fails ? It won 't . You 'll be back on September 5 , 1966 at 4 p.m. Why 4 p.m. ? We sent the mice at 4 . And they always came back . It became a habit Superstitious scientists ! Why did you pick me ? Our computer did . Out of millions .. Naturally . That 's normal . T. 5. makes you sleep . I talk in my sleep . And when you wake up ? I feel all right . You 'll have a larger dose . ... tomorrow . You 'll be drugged but perfectly lucid . Will it fail if I move ?

In four hours ? One envelope per 2 minutes . It 's a record . Is she pretty ? The record-breaker . In a way . Send her in . Even your car is a problem . Shall we stop for lunch later ? If you like . Something about Catherine bothers me . Doesn 't she care for you ? She 's too quiet . What did she do ? Nothing . And now ? Nothing . That 's not much . He 's under the effect of T. 5 . 5 times already . I feared that transition period . We can 't get him earlier . It can go on for days . If we wait he 'll starve . Odd to see that from a heated train . Was it cold ? Very cold . Here 's a town I liberated . We were about 50 facing 20 Germans . Guns don 't fit you . Never got used to them . Your name may be on a street . It wasn 't so pretty by then . You didn 't come Wednesday . Come tonight , both of you . You and Catherine . We 've separated . After how long ? 7 years . Come alone then . That dirty wall scares me . The papers scare me more . We should decorate your office . ... with a big picture of an unpaid bill . Or the kidnapping of commas by a bookkeeper . An eraser and no pencil ? I love needless things . Complements of the author . Not very original ... I don 't know these people . A swimmer got drowned . Is he dead ? He was a good swimmer . Must have swum for hours before he drowned . Be quiet . You treat me like a stuffed owl . But I move , I see people . If I didn 't , I 'd kill myself . The more I give you , the worse you get . Since I can 't help you I am leaving . It 's 3 p. m . 3 hours to go . 3 minutes ago it was 3 p. m . In 3 weeks it will be 3 p. m . In a century too . Time passes for everybody but me .

For 100 million years algae and molluscs and reptiles ruled the earth till this firm was created ... I 'm approaching death at full speed . The earth will spin without me ... And I 'm here expressing our regrets to a customer for the loss of his shipment . A mouse ? Here ? Were you talking ? I just saw a mouse . A mouse on a beach ! It 's on vacation . We have succeeded ! He isn 't dead . A race against time . Who 's winning ? Don 't know yet . She 's pretty , neat , moderate things I despise . You despise everything . I like things that seesaw . Do I seesaw ? Not at all . You 're spread out . You 're a swamp , mud ... - Gloomy - I should wring your neck or slowly slip into you . Mona and her showcase . You smell like drownings ... This beach is me ... I need you . I needed you when they told me of a girl who hated envelopes . ... and work . Let 's make love . On the sand ? I 'd run away to a land without nights ... Your wife has a cute bottom . I 'll tell you what you see . You 're by a window . Everything is blue the sea , the sand , the town ... Even people get blue ... Pretty girls already are ... I miss you Claude ... It both bothers me and pleases me ... It 's the first time I ever care about people . There 's a white sail and some sea gulls . Are there any on the Riviera ? They mean rain ... It never rains there . We 'll never finish tonight . You 're making errors . It 's always beautiful . Not that sickening green . Coming ? Later . And if I 'd been married ? I don 't know ... It wasn 't love at first sight ... It was different ... You didn 't fit at office . So I knew nothing mattered . I might not have liked you . I was so scared that night ... Why did you quit your job ? To impress you . Were you making lots of money ? A living . Your eyes are nice . And I want you . Shall we answer ? - No - I love you . Do you hear me ? I love you . T 'was the only reason . Long before you died . And now I 'm dead . I 'm cold . I hear my words . It 's the drug ... What are my chances of surviving ? 100 % if you were a mouse . I am a mouse then . They 'll come now in 4 minutes . Where 's the mouse ? You 're delirious ! Unfortunately not . Claude , please stop . You scare me . Don 't mean to . I killed Catherine 2 months ago . I don 't believe it . You 're right and wrong . What do you mean ? I can 't kill ... Yet I did . Impossible . I thought so too . They should get rid of the streetcars . Buses are just as bad . Cars will be useless soon . I 'm sorry , sir . If you take the streetcar you 'll miss your train . Have you got time ? We 'll have to sew the cat 's eyes . What ? We have a cat . Are psychoses red ? The future is red . And psychoses ? I get them mixed up . Are you awake too ? Go to the office for me . I need you . I 'm hard to live with . I don 't care . I want to be with you . Stay with me tonight . Don 't leave me . I 'm afraid to find myself alone tomorrow . We could go to ... Last time he stayed a minute and a half . Now he 's been gone 3 minutes ... Unless he keeps reliving 1 minute . T 'would be better so . I couldn 't stay there . Stay here , I 'm going home . Aren 't you sleepy ? She 'd be sad if you didn 't come . She 's always sad if I 'm there ... If I 'm not ... She 's sadness in person . You should be used to it . I think of leaving her . Nobody can help her . She needs you . That doesn 't help . Could you leave her ? Probably not . I can 't stand it . I feel oxidized ... Once I left for 2 days . She didn 't care a fig . You 've had it . She loved the sea but got sad on the Riviera . She loves the sun . She hates sunlight . You can 't live with her or without her . And so God said : " Hope the earth 'll turn " . You go to sleep . I 'm not sleepy . You 're not good at that . I never write . This job doesn 't suit you . No work does . You 've just earned ... 14 francs . A pack of cigarettes Won 't be back after lunch . How long did you hope to live on this job ? A day ... tomorrow . Here 's what we 'll do ... I give you 14 francs ... And you ask me to lunch . Why ? I don 't want to . You never buy anything . I do . Bread , milk , matches , mustard ... Nothing for you . Don 't need anything . Buy a sweater ... I 've got 2 . No visits ? Don 't want to see people . Let 's stay out all night . We go to bed very late . That 's different . You all right ? How was it ? Great . Something 's gone wrong . What time is it ? They took my watch . No watches for trip in time . I couldn 't count the seconds . 4 minutes make ... one ... two ... three ... - No - What kind of no ? Just no . Because not yes ? You said yes ! She can sure say no . Can 't they tell ? I 'm here ! They must know it ! I 'm back ! I 'm back ! Centuries have passed outside . I 've been forgotten ... We 'll get him in three minutes . Oh , there you are ! You 're on a trip too . Did you go far ? They can 't get you back either . We 're both in a mess . I know you . You 're the mouse I saw on the beach . You take trips in my past . You don 't have a watch either . I have to get out of here ! I 'll concentrate . It 's 10,30 you know I feel awful . Are you sick ? If Caterine had died , we 'd know it . It 's so simple . You heard about her . But never met her . Not many of my friends really knew her . You hid her . People bored her . She had family ? No , no cousins , no friends no boss , no job ... Not even any papers . No one will miss her . People think we 've separated . You left her there ? Why bring her back ? Why tell me ? Because nobody knows . You let me caress you ... You say you love him . I is , you am ... If I caress you it 's because I 'm lonely tonight . If Caterine left me I 'd be thrilled . I once knew a man ... You are not listening . I 'm listening to your fingers . You 've changed . I 'll never write again . I know that song . I 'll show you something you 'll like . Is it big ? Tiny . You 'll love it . Animal , vegetable . astral or mineral ? Half and half . I want to stay with you tonight . What 's wrong ? I 'm terrified . You are afraid ? Afraid means terrified . Not in the least ! Try to read then . Only one of my eyes wants to read . You are absolutely I don 't know what . I 'm afraid too . Of dying ? - No - Never heard such a thing . You still here ? Will you be out late ? Yes . He lives quite far away . It 's too hot in here . Come with me . I 've called a taxi . Glasgow is too gloomy . Buy me some oranges . What 's the matter ? Can 't you sleep ? I wanted the light on . Come close to me . Simple things are harder to understand . Did you go to school ? Yes but I never listened . But you read ? Books don 't teach everything . Claude told me the electric cable kept the streetcars on the tracks . I 'd never thought of it . I thought they ranon gas . " The Martian Viewpoint " . Missed by two minutes .

That will cost more . Still can 't send them till 17th . B travelled 1 minute into the past . A hero ! When ? Yesterday . With no ill effects . How do you know it really happened ? That 's the problem ... Never thought I 'd talk about that ... I 'll go buy some cigarettes . What are you doing here ? I couldn 't sleep . I was afraid I 'd die . So I came here . At your return you 'd have found me dead . ... or sleeping . I found a girl in the bathroom ... She was very sexy . Everyman 's dream . Nothing happened . I just washed her . I dream about her . We accolege reseat of your of the 2nd ... Happy to learn that you never deceived our watchamacallit ... We 'll fend you a new one and cope it alives chafely ... Except our exclusives . Yours , screwly . I killed Catherine in Glasgow 2 months ago . We needed it yesterday . We can work all night . He has no pencil . He never has . Does he know it 's urgent ? He makes mistakes . Can 't spell " tomorrow " . It 's late . Isn 't he tired ? Has he seen this spot ? Are you staying over ? You 're right about this green . Some are allergic to green . It makes our cells wear out . Scientists invent can openers detergents , etc without changing anything , That 's the secret . And no one found it . We 'll give up salad ... Buy a boat . I 'll learn to steer .. I 'll find another reason to be sad . I 'm just a burden . If I only had money ... Can 't see you rich ... I 'd pretend to be poor . Oh ! A tree ! ... and a weed . Field trees are rarer . You missed my road sign . Are you sure ? Are you sure ? Take this one . It 's better . I 'll tell them . But the other one ... You got me my false papers ... Don 't you know me ? I was called Rabois in 43 . I had false papers too . You have a calcite . Is it serious ? Not terribly . You killed her all the same . That 'll be 90 francs . Shall I come back ? Are you tired ? Why ? I don 't know . Didn 't you talk ? What about ? Nothing . I wasn 't listening . What do you want ? To eat . I bought spinach . - Grass - I 'd like huge herring . I can 't do anything . In fact who are you ? Something blurred more and more blurred ... I shrink in water . What do you write ? I don 't write much . Shall we have lunch together ? It was a perfect crime . I 'll dress ... I like you all mauve . What if God created the cat in His Image ? Then after some time He created man as a slave to the cat . The cat got lucidity ... And man the passion to own . No , you don 't see . Man was created for the cat 's sake . And his only aim is to feed and comfort the cat . He invented lots of things , ... only for the cat 's profit . Fishermen , cushions , radiators and the radio for cats love music . Glad to know why we are on earth ! So am I. What is it ? A beetle . What 's wrong ? - Nothing - Where 's the car ? You slept with her ? Do you care ? Do you ? You are so superficial . I dreamed of going away with some inept employee of mine ... We 'll go away somewhere . Then we 'll come back ... Another coffee ? Why did you pick me ? Our computer did . Out of millions . Our oldest employee . He 's the computer . He 'll like that . Buried all alone in that mud . A guide to graveyards would be a best-seller . Luceram cemetery . One shinbone . Others . Worth a detour . No shinbone . Avoid . Rather live here than die here . It only happens in books . I don 't mean to scare you . I killed Catherine 2 months ago in Glasgow . I don 't believe it . You 're right and wrong . I can 't kill . Yet I did . Impossible . She hated Glasgow . She was very depressed . She was absolutely ... We haven 't slept all night . I 'll be tired . Let 's try to sleep . It 's strange to wake up like this . She was asleep . And smiling . Smiling for the first time . She looked happy . That 's how it happened . I looked at her . 29 minutes . What shall we do ? We must try the impossible . Are you Mr. Ridder ? Wiana went to the post-office . Come in if you like . We 're in the bathroom . Which one do you take ? The left one . I 'm Nicole . Can I take a bath ? Wash my back . What do you do at the office ? Sometimes I think . I pick up an object . This pen is red ... But it writes black . Deceiving appearances ... It 's a very common pencil . It has a point like a pencil . It rolls like a pencil . If you hold it up it 's a tree or a pencil . I never use a pencil Why have one ? Tables are meant for holding pencils . - Go on . - There are also erasers and paper . We received 150 complaints . ... and 300 letters . We 're caught up . He 's replied to a letter we haven 't got yet . I 'm absolutely exhausted . It 's going to be a nice day . If people are up , it 's ... Everything 's ready . Is it much ? 5 whole years .

Even send Catherine to hell Well , call her . I don 't have her number . All I can do is wait . Let 's not go home . He 's all right . Quite still . Let 's stay some more . I 'll concentrate . I have to find that minute . I 'm in the water . Yhe sun 's out ... Catherine is on the beach . The water 's warm ... I want to take a bath . Sorry , I don 't speak French . Then where is Catherine ? After all ... Nothing ... Do you have to go ? I should . Stay with me . I can 't find an excuse every day . I 'll help you find them . You 're already late . Punctually late ... Never more than an hour . Seen many fish ? 2 sea serpents , some sharks ... Nothing 's happening . Nothing 's changed . I 'm going to die . Catherine you were right . I 'd like to see the mouse . He comes back more often . For 30 seconds the last time . That 's not much . A storm at 7 a. m . is unusual . People get up early . God ... the workers ... You don 't understand ... You 're lucky . One can bear a hard life ... Hoping things will turn better . To be happy is much harder . Because one knows it won 't last . When one 's hungry time drags ... 3 months or 60 years to die ... One even adapts to cancer . Choose something ... Carrots are good for the skin . Spinach for influenza ... Fruits are a cure-all . I can 't help you . I 'm sorry I met you . There was no escaping it . Some wine ? Makes me sleepy . Have you been here long ? We can work now . We miss the documents . Glad to see you , cat ... Did she feed you today ? Not much . She 's stingy . Outside you had less to eat . Must I starve here ? You exaggerate . So that you believe me . I don 't like your records . They 're all alike . I had friends outside . We 're your friends . You 're not so clever . Sophie thinks we are . What do you read ? What does that mean ? It bores me to explain . I don 't care . It has nothing to do with me . And you ? Nothing . Then it 's silly . Depends on how you look at it . I 'm getting mixed up ... I quite like you . You can 't say that . I can think it . I used to wake up at night . I hated it . I stayed awake so as not to wake up . But now it 's over . I sleep until morning . I sleep well , don 't I ? I often thought of killing her . I believe it . Do you ? I thought of what you said . It 's possible you 've killed her . And do you know why ? To end it all . To end her suffering . She was incurable , wasn 't she ? The periods vary . We can 't do anything . Then he 's lost . I went there to see a lawyer . We were in a little hotel . We turned on the gas heater . She 'd taken a sleeping pill . She was asleep , She was smiling . For the first time . She looked happy . No longer afraid . That 's how it happened . I was going out ... I smelled gas ... The gas was on ... I looked at her ... When I came back , she was dead . The cops were there . You must be lying . Why didn 't they arrest you ? It looked like an accident . It was an accident . I lied to see if you 'd believe me . The flame must have died out while I was out . She really died there ? For a moment I was glad though it was awful . She didn 't suffer ... Then I realized she 'd gone for ever . And I couldn 't stand it . It gets worse and worse . What 's wrong ? George is dead . He died 8 months ago . You knew it ? His wife wrote me . You didn 't tell me . You were depressed . Can you imagine a man who , to spare his wife would hide all bad news . He 'd hire actors to replace ... people who had died . He 'd put all newspapers away from her . He 'd have to cover up the planet . It would cost a lot . It 's ghastly . What ? Everything . Even when you 're with me . Page 8 : put " Corriego " in italics . Same page : you forgot the word " conjugated " . Page 9 is all right . Page 14 : no " c " in " solipsism " . Yes , it looks funny . Page 12 : " visual and tactile . " More than an hour . We 'll never get him back . His pulse is slow . He 's lost a lot of blood . Can we move him ? Call the hospital . We 'll have to check our figures .

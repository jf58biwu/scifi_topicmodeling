 Mr. Parnell , will you take a look ? You dirt-livered sprawl of rat-backs ! Back with me now . You gutless lot of tea-boilers ! Get back to work ! Oh , run now , you worm-livered garbles ! Push , Mike McGreavy . Sainted mother of God . Cassidy , Denysen , Gwenyth and poor Danny there . Oh , it 's a terrible thing . Three days , and each day , five more men slaughtered down . You heathen savages ! Mike , go fetch a burial crew from Menifee . That I 'll be doing . Mr. Parnell , now , the threats that five more men will be killed each day until the money 's been paid these savages ... So now , the men are already dead . Four only . No man 'll be coming back here again , seeing as he might make the fifth man . Those four men were my friends , each and all . Tell those men to return here . They 're going to work here or I myself will murder five times five . I was only after asking . Enough of asking and get moving . That I 'll be doing . And cloth ! Bring cloth for winding sheets ! Meantime , I 'll be cutting these lads down . No friend of mine is going to be buried with a heathen 's arrow in him . Oh , Mr. Parnell , indeed . And that 's the fifth man , at that . The noble red man . Hey , I have to look the part , don 't I ? I mean , the once proud Indian brought low by the white man 's vices . I hate to clip your feathers , Artemus , but please , just look the part . Restrain yourself . No whiskey , no women . All right , if that 's how - How - just information . I want you to get the feel of the situation . The railroad 's been stopped for over a week . Yeah , from the reports , I gather the men are scared , ready to quit . Not illogical , you know . Five of them killed every day for a week now . Frankly , sir , I advise payment . $ 500,000 ? Tennyson , you 'll never own a railroad . Too spendthrift . The railroad doesn 't want to pay . The government doesn 't want to pay blood money to a bunch of murderers who , by every indication , may be a band of Cheyenne . I thought Indians didn 't use money . They don 't , except to buy arms . Uh-oh . Mm-hmm . That 's why Washington has sent us brave gents here to find the killers , round them up and get the railroad moving again . In how long ? One week . One week ? Well , here 's to sin . And salvation . Artemus . Menifee 's straight ahead two miles right through those woods . It 's a shortcut . Oh , thanks . Be careful . I don 't think the townspeople are too fond of Indians . Me no Cheyenne , me tame Indian . Tennyson ! Sir ? We 're coming into Menifee . It 's a bit sparse , sir , isn 't it ? You 're on the wrong side of the track . Oh . Not sure I don 't prefer the other side , sir . Jim . General Ball . Ah ! A man and a half , huh , Jim ? A funny thing , you know . The flesh and bone are healed in that , but sometimes I actually feel that missing hand is still there . It itches . But a man is more than one hand and a piece of arm , isn 't he ? I couldn 't agree with you more , sir . Especially a man like you , General . Well , thank you , Jim . You know , I 'm your contact out here . That 's first rate , sir . I don 't see why we 're standing here grinning like a couple of fools . This is not going to be all pelt and hurrah . At least we 're working together again , sir . That 's right , that 's right , Jim . I got problems out here . The men behind this railroad . Never could stand politicians and these are Wall Street politicians - the worst kind . What kind of problems ? Well , you come and meet ' em , find out . Gentleman , this is Captain Jim West . Mr. Adamson , Mr. Penrose . Gentlemen . All right , West , you 're the miracle-maker . How do you propose to solve our headache ? My way . When ? Soon . I fear thee you 've stuck a tartar , Benjamin . Are thee truly so confident , friend West ? This railroad , sir , is an important commercial venture , true - but to the Union , an absolute necessity . I plan to stop these killings or become one of the victims . Ah ! Words , promises . We 've had all those . What we need now is action . Those Indians want $ 500,000 . In gold . It 's outrageous . They demanded payment of a fee for protection against these killings . So I 've been informed . Pay for protection against their own crimes , or else they 'll stop the building of the whole railroad . They 're scalawags . Scalawags , yes , but Indians ? Behind anything as well-planned as this sort of extortion ? This Cheyenne chief is an unusual man , Jim . He goes by the name of American Knife . He 's quite civilized enough to know the value of gold . Actually , civilized is not the proper word . Cunning would be more appropriate . And arrogant . He 's demanded payment of the gold cast in the form of railroad spikes . It 's true , friend Ball , he is cunning . But gold attracts greed . But disguised as railroad spikes , it can be brought here secretly . We 've already caused the gold to be cast . It will be shipped here from Chicago . I have told you - you pay a ransom once , you 'll pay it a dozen times . We asked the government for troops and they send us one man . The government cannot supply enough troops to patrol a thousand miles of track , and Captain West is not just one man . I 'm sure you 'll find him more effective than a good number of troops . You 've seen his record . Yes , we have , and it 's good . But tell me , friend West , will thee gamble the lives of five men each day on thyself ? Let me put it this way , Mr. Penrose - I believe you build a railroad , not bribe it into existence . I 'll gamble my life and try to protect the others . How ? To begin with , an armed guard for every track-laying gang . I can arrange that . Meanwhile , I 'll look for the killers . Do you have a lead on the Cheyenne ? Led by American Knife ? You might as well try to nail smoke on the wall . Let me have three days to make my play . Three days ? Possibly 15 men . Possibly . I say no . I say yes . Give friend West his chance . All right . Three days . Then I better not waste any of it . Good day , gentlemen . We 'll expect regular reports , mind you . Of course , Mr. Adamson . Every three days . Sheila Parnell , lass . I don 't think you should be going into a place like this . And you , Mike McGreavy ... and Demmett McCafferty , and Peter Connelly . I been hearing what you 've been saying all over town . Now , Miss Parnell , your father ... Ah , yes , my father barely in his grave and his dear friends lying about in this wooden hovel drinking till you can 't think and telling the world a prize should be paid to his killers . Now then , Miss Parnell , there 's no call to be causing trouble . Trouble ? My father 's murderers ... Now , lass , will you ... ! Sir , why don 't you have another drink , huh ? Just a minute , buddy . I didn 't ask for you to mix in my affairs . Wasn 't gallantry , Miss Parnell . I wanted to ask you about your father . Oh , you do , do you ? And why ? Well , he was killed , blown up by three pounds of gun cotton . Oh . And I want to know why . So would I. Perhaps we could talk a bit more privately . My pleasure . Your place ? Yes . All right , who are you ? And why are you so interested in my father 's death ? My name 's James West and I 'm here officially to investigate these killings . Especially your father 's . Don 't believe him , Sheila . I know how Jack Parnell died - I was there . He died violently and swiftly . Now let his memory rest in peace . No ! Mike , I never mentioned it , but I know something . There was a man who approached my father . Tried to bribe him , I was listening . And when my father refused , he threatened to kill him . Well , now , that is interesting . Mike McGreavy . It 's a hard world , little Sheila and you 've run into part of that hardness . Now drop your gun belt and don 't reach for your gun or I 'll shoot little Sheila right before your eyes . Did you kill my father ? No . I 'm employed at a handsome fee to make sure that nobody finds out who did . Put your gun on the table . Now open that trap door , huh ? And now you 're going to kill us . Oh , no . There 's a man , he wants to speak to you , yes . That 's solid rock down there , yes . And that door bolts on top . Now , you 'll keep very quietly down there while my , uh - Employer . Thank you . My employer comes to speak to you . Now , down you go . Mike ... ! Don 't be a fool . Down you go . You too , boyo . You 're fighting a losing battle , West . I 'll be back before morning . You stupid man . I had him distracted up there . You could 've ... Could 've done what ? This way , I 'll bring the man I really want to see . Gives us a certain measure of privacy . They 'll have to break in . Sheila , you 're going to have to trust me . Tell me about your father . Three nights past , late , I woke up . My father was speaking to a man . Who ? Just a shadow of a big man . He had an educated voice , full of refinement , and ... it was a cruel voice . He wanted my father to fix the gradings so the rails would slide in the first rain . And your father said no . And the next day , he was dead . I 'm sorry . Don 't be sorry . I 've done my mourning . I want my revenge . On a shadow ? Or the very unlikely Indian ? An educated man . You 'll be all right , Sheila . I have friends waiting . It 'll be a long , cold night . We could comfort each other . If I 'm to face death tomorrow , I could use a bit of comfort this night . Shh ! What took you so long ? I was busy following Mike McGreavy . And ? I lost him . Somebody found him . You better get out of that Indian suit . Oh , yeah . It 's clear that the shadow , whoever he is , overheard us and learned that Sheila can 't identify him . So , he just eliminated Mike McGreavy and went on his merry way , eh ? Mm-hmm , leaving us with one day gone and not much done . Well , the work gangs are sure that the Indians are behind it - American Knife and the Cheyenne . But with armed guards out there , they 're working . What about American Knife ? Do you have any lead on him ? Eh , nobody know nothing . Tongue still , like deep water . He 's in the hills somewhere . Nobody knows which hills . Jim ... two of the girls that wait tables at the Silver Dollar are Indian . I could talk to them , woman-to-woman . All right , but as man to woman , be careful , huh ? I will . James , my boy , that is a nice , useful , sort of gorgeous girl . The only kind to have for a tight situation . Tennyson ! Sir ! Did you telegraph the Indian Bureau ? Oh , yes , sir . They informed me that American Knife was raised by missionaries . They assessed him as very intelligent but most ungrateful , apparently because he left them and returned to the Cheyenne nation . They 've never forgiven him for that , sir . But why do you want to contact this chap ? I mean , if he isn 't the fellow behind the fuss , as you might say . But , Tennyson , we don 't know that . Oh , yes , we do . Sheila said it was an educated man . Sheila 's very pretty and very charming , but I don 't trust her . Well , now ... when you get to be an old codger like me , you 'll learn to admire and revere the fair sex as I do . I wouldn 't trust you , either . Now , look here , you young whippersnapper , I may be an old man down on his luck , but I 'm still a man of honor . Well , maybe a little , on a cloudy day . Now , you go out and risk it . Go on out there and build a railroad . He always tells me to go out and build something ... A mite early for that , isn 't it , son ? This is the way to build a railroad , old man . I 'll just relax while you , uh , fetch another load , eh ? Fine , right here . Thanks very much . What 's the story ? Well , the guards are careless . Some of them are half-drunk . The men are scared . Any trouble , they 'd run clear back to Chicago . Another hour , it 'll be late afternoon . I think we can expect an attack between now and dusk . Well , I join you , Captain West , in your great expectations . How many men did you say were on that rail car ? Five . Are you all right ? Oh , go on , go on without me . You 'll miss all the fun . Captain West , I presume . The Cheyenne welcome you . Sit down , please . As you have probably discerned , I am American Knife , the medicine man of this little group . Harvard . Good heavens , no . Dartmouth . I see . Tell me , as a medicine man , did you take your degree in science ? Philosophy . An insatiable curiosity over the strange customs of ... the savage white man . For example , his religious practices in the use of scapegoats . This is the reason you were picked up . I ... I would like a favor , Captain West . Such as ? Speaking of scapegoats , the Cheyenne are being used as such . Blamed for the attacks on your railroad . My people are innocent , and I do not want them forced into a hopeless war . You 're the first scapegoat I 've seen with a tomahawk . Come . Care for a cheap scalp ? He 's white . Well , dirty white . What can I do ? Grant us amnesty . We will come into any military post you designate and wait peacefully until the real culprits are caught . It 's a deal . Just like that ? Well , why not ? I know you 're innocent . You are embarrassing me , Captain West . Some of my people are traditionalist . They simply insist on your being tortured to prove your willingness to help us . Mmm . I , uh , I understand your predicament . I knew you 'd see the problem . But we should be able to arrive at a creative solution . I promise to be as painless as possible . Yeah . I am called Little Willow . Don 't tell me you 're the tribal torturer - the torturess . Yes . The angry ones of my people demand that you be tested with pain . American Knife choose me . N-Now you seem to be an intelligent girl . Not superstitious . Mmm . You smell interesting . You smell different . So do you . Uh , is-is this torture really necessary ? Only a little . They wish to hear you scream . You scream good . Very good . It would be sad thing to mark you with knife cuts . A waste . Oh , I-I hate waste . I don 't want to hurt my throat screaming . Would a few moans be all right ? Mm-hmm . Mmm ... mmm ... You lost your disguise . Well , wouldn 't you ? James ? ! They , uh , they , uh , softening us up to carve us up ? No , no , no , they 're ... they 're friendly Indians . Oh . Allow me to present American Knife . A pleasure , Mr. Gordon . Call me Artemus . This is Little Willow . Oh . My pleasure . She 's the tribal torturer . Masochist . I made a deal : Amnesty in exchange for assistance . You see , Mr. Gordon ... Uh , Artemus . Why you whites have these incomprehensible names , I will never understand . At any rate , we are going to help you find the renegade camp . How ? I killed one . In the interest of security , they should come back for the body . Nice work , Artemus . A pleasure . Talk . Where 's your camp ? Talk . If we stick to the shadows , we might be able to mix in . Mm-hmm . You should have no difficulty . All you whites look alike . Artemus , you go that way . I 'll go around the other side . Good luck . Huh ? Hey , what are you , a Peeping Tom or something ? I 'm sorry , sir . I was just drifting through , that 's all . Hey , you a cute one . Well , thank you . Oh , wait a minute . Oh , now wait . No , no , fight ... Sir , I don 't want to fight . Really , I have no desire to do it . Hey , no ... ! And now , ma 'am , if you 'll excuse me . Oh , you won me fair and square . Uh ... Oh , no , really . It wouldn 't be fair to you . I ... Sugar , I don 't mind one bit . Mmm ... Mmm ... Thank you , but I really have to be going . Why , you 're downright shy . Now , we 're going to catch ' em tomorrow . And this attack should shake the gold right out of them . We gonna leave the usual five dead calling cards ? Five times five . Now we 'll hit at 4 : 00 . 4 : 00 . That 's right , 4 : 00 . And remember it . Make a note of it . Right . Where they coming in from ? At the end of the line , where else ? There 'll be two parties converging - from the north and the east . Northern party will come in right here and overrun the position . We 'll sit down right here and pick ' em off . That 's kind of risky . Sure it 's kind of risky ! We 're throwing every man we 've got into this attack . Well , not every man , Farrell . We lost one today . Don 't worry , Cheeve , we 'll make it work . You bet we will . And remember one thing , that the success of this attack depends entirely upon surprise . I don 't hear anything . No , I think we smoked him out . How was that ? Say , I 'll guarantee you that West heard every word we said . Mmm . An eager cuss , too , ain 't he ? Imagine , right up there on top of the cave . You know , I 'll bet my second-best britches he 's out right now figuring out an ambush . Jim West is too competent an officer not to take advantage of this . He 'll have every man capable of carrying a gun waiting for us . He 'll set up a first-class ambush . Which is just fine . We set up an ambush of our own . Well , now that we 're all present , we can get down to business . Gentlemen , I came as soon as I got your message . I 'm sure this meeting is of the utmost importance . It is indeed . Well , our third day is fast drawing to a close , friend West . And what have you accomplished ? My associate , Mr. Gordon , and I have discovered there is to be a major attack this afternoon at 4 : 00 at rail 's end . No ! Savages ! All right , we 'll set up an ambush and finish off these Indians once and for all . Fine . Except they 're not Indians . What ? ! Impossible . Is that true , Jim ? It 's true , I 'm positive . They 're a crew of renegades . Former raiders . Well-armed and well-led . Not Indians ? Well ... that is a surprise . Well , that 's even better . Instead of facing the whole Cheyenne nation all we have is a few outlaws , so we just lay the ambush ... I don 't agree . What ? They 're in force . Frankly , after considering the problem , I advise paying the money . But they have advised resistance . Pay the money ? ! Why , you don 't mean that , Jim . Believe me , sir , I hate to disappoint you but we have to face facts . We don 't have the men or the arms to face any kind of a battle . Gold , gentlemen , is much cheaper than lives . Well , I 'm well aware of that . But to pay tribute to a band of murdering outlaws . That 's the only way , sir . Well , I don 't agree ! Gentlemen . Gentlemen , we 've been prepared for this eventuality . What , you mean you have the gold here ? Yes ... we have the gold . The gold has been shipped from Chicago disguised as railway spikes , as requested . $ 500,000 worth . It 's a fortune . A vast fortune , and you 're ready to throw it away . I know how you feel , General . I agree with you . But Mr. West represents the government and if he advises payment ... And I do . You know the method of payment ? Yes . We light a signal fire three miles west of town . Then we send out a work train with the gold on a flatcar in front of the engine to the end of the line . There it will be removed . I don 't like it . I never have . You think I do ? What else could I advise ? What else , indeed . Then it 's , uh , all settled , gentlemen . It is . We will pay . Fine . Gentlemen , I only have one more thing to say . We 're doing the only possible thing . Half a million dollars , gentlemen . That 's a dangerous amount of money to place in the wrong hands . Perfect , James , my boy . One of your smoothest smoke screens . Everything else all set ? Naturally . Something 's not right . Pick them up . Uh , excuse me , sir . Uh , there 's been an accident here . Could you give us a hand ? Oh , certainly . Easy , West . Now , turn around real easy . Well , here they are , boys ! Five of them . They 're sure going to make handsome corpses . You know , I think we got today 's quota . West , we 're going to have to search you . Now they tell me you 're kind of tricky but I think my hand tops yours . If you take his coat off , you 'll find he 's wearing a ... a sleeve gun . And down the back of his coat ... you 'll find a knife . And in his hat a wire . And in the heels of his boots , you 'll find a breakaway derringer . Pete . Now ain 't he the sly one ? And he got a little picklock here in his lapel . Well , what do you know ? Well , let him keep that . I don 't think we have to worry about his escaping from prison , do we ? No . Good intelligence work , Farrell . Well , thank you . Well , he 's clean . Give him back his coat . You murdering skunk . You 'll never get away with this ! Well , I 'm sure going to try . You 're nothing but a bunch of murderers ! That 's right . And you keep yapping like you are and I 'm going to put you right on my list ! Sir , I consider that ... a personal affront . Tennyson . Now why did you do that ? Prepare to defend yourself , sir . May I have a little room , please ? Hold it ! What were you trying to do ? Now get ' em out of here and tie ' em up . Come on . Sit . Is that an order ? Don 't you have to wait for the top man to give you orders ? You think I 'm not in command ? You don 't have the brains . Quite correct . Quite astute , Jim . That 'll be all , Farrell . They set off the signal fire , General . Excellent . Well , you don 't seem surprised , Jim . No . I didn 't expect you would be . The tactics in that very professional raid you let me overhear - I remember that plan well , General . You executed it brilliantly at Shiloh . Ah . You always were a clever fellow . Why didn 't you act ? I needed proof . I wasn 't sure . Only enough to feel sorry . Sorry ? Don 't pass judgment so easily , Jim . Five men killed every day . What kind of judgment would you like , General ? They took away my command when I was meant for greatness . I thought you 'd achieved it , sir . No . No . I devoted my life to the Army . I lose a hand . Suddenly I 'm less than half a man . I spend 18 months in a hospital , rotting , and how do they reward me ? With exile . Spend the rest of my life rotting out here . I 'm five times the strategist Grant is . Five times . Yet he 's in the White House , and I 'm out here . So now you want $ 500,000 worth of revenge . Exactly . I 'm going to Mexico . My men are good men , good fighting men . We 'll set up a state . We 'll take over the country . And who knows where we 'll go from there . It 's time , General . The train has left Menifee . The gold train ... has left Menifee . Everything 's ready , General . Good , good . Stand by . All right , everybody sit up ! Here 's the general . It 's a fine observation point . You 'll be able to see everything from here . I thought you were going to pick the gold up at rail 's end . That 's four miles down the line . I had to alter my plans a little , Jim , after you refused to set up an ambush . Now , General , why would I set up an ambush only to fall into your trap ? As it happens , I don 't mind you 've shuttled the gold out toward me , and I 'm here to collect it . You hope . Oh , I 'm sure you set up some clever little counter plot . That 's why I picked you all up , so you couldn 't trigger it . And I thought you might . If I know you well enough , Jim , you probably filled a baggage car with armed men . Not a bad idea . Naturally . So I 've set explosives along the track . We 'll let the flatcar with the gold go by , and then when the baggage car comes along , we 'll blow it up and your men . Well , General , you 're certainly thorough . Yes . It 's a mark of genius . Jackson ? Yes , sir . Jackson was a sniper with Quantrell . First-class marksman . There 's a hundred pounds of powder down there ; a case of blasting caps - one bullet ... the baggage car goes up , your reinforcements . The trap is sprung , and the gold is mine . It 's a good plan . It might work . Yes , it will . Watch . Get busy with the knife . Right . When you hear the explosion , go for the gold . Don 't worry , General , we 'll get it . Are you getting it ? I am . What are you going to do ? I have to blow up that charge before the train runs over it . I 'll be free in a minute . Keep this . You may need it . Let 's go . You got him ! You saved the gold ! Well done , sir ! Very courageous , Jim . But very stupid . I 'm sorry , James . I understand your problem . It is very difficult to kill an old friend , so I thought ... a new friend should do it for you . We owe thee and thy people both an apology and a debt of gratitude . Oh , come , come . Civilized men must stand together against the outbursts of these barbarians . That 's a peculiar accent for a Cheyenne . Uh , Dartmouth . Oh . Yes . Excuse me , sir . A drink ? Uh , no thank thee . Fire water , sir . Fire water ... and soda . Gentlemen , I propose a toast to Captain West . And to our half million dollars . Oh , yes . Hear , hear . I would like to propose a toast , also . To General Ball ... and what he once was . And for how he 'll be remembered . Hear , hear . Truth often has a bitter taste , but if thee can keep it down , it strengthens a man . Have a good trip to Chicago . Thank you . Uh , thank you very much , sir . Pleasant journey , gentlemen . Thank you . American Knife . Hmm , I must be off , too . But you will stop on your next trip here . Who knows , some day you may say , " Some of my best friends are Cheyenne . " Well , let 's get this train on the road , huh ? Civilization , here we come ! That 's for me . Wine , women and some off-key harmonizing . I just finished . What ? Making food . We almost fought about it . Until we decided that you must decide . Irish stew ? Or buffalo tongue ? Unless , of course , you have the stomach for both . Both .

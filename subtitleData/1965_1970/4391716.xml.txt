 ( tires screeching ) Uh , David Vincent , please . Has he checked in yet ? I don 't have much time . Don 't see the name . Hold on . I 'll double-check . ( phone ringing ) Mm ... Hattie ? Henry ? Young lady 's here asking if a David Vincent 's checked in . Well , how would I know ? If he isn 't registered , he isn 't here . Mr. Vincent isn 't here yet . 'Course , it 's still early . ( tires screeching ) Please , do you have a back door ? What 's wrong , dear ? You have to help me . I ... Morning , gentlemen . Good morning . I , uh , I 'm looking for someone- - my ... fiancee . She 's a pretty girl , about so tall ... long , brown hair , wearing a beige coat . Yep , that 's the girl . Oh , she 's here ? Was here . Asked where to go for breakfast . I sent her to the cafe on the corner . Thank you . Thank you . You 're very kind . City types- - trouble written all over them . I 'm calling the sheriff . No . No , don 't . Are you afraid of the law ? I just need a place to hide until David Vincent gets here . The sheriff can protect you a great deal better than I can . You stay away from that board . Now , see here , young lady ... I said stay away from that board ! Why ... wha ... What 's wrong with you , child . I ... I 'm just trying to help you . Stay away ! NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Suzanne Pleshette ... Will Geer ... Kent Smith . NARRATOR : The Sycamore Guest House , Arbor City , Massachusetts- - scene of a vicious , senseless killing . David Vincent had been summoned here by a woman he 'd never met . Her name : Anne Gibbs . Her reason for calling him : She had been marked for death by creatures from an alien planet . ( sighs ) Who could 've killed her , Tom ? Who could 've killed my Hattie ? Well , that 's what I 'm trying to find out , Hank . Hank , I want you to tell me everything that happened in here this morning . Well , I was there in my back office . Hattie called here from the front desk to say there was a young lady ... A young lady ? Young lady asking about a reservation for a ... a David Vincent . And who 's he ? I don 't know . He hasn 't checked in yet . David Vincent . Make a note of that name . She 's the one that 's most likely- - that young lady . She is the one that must 've killed Hattie . Why ? Because she was here , that 's why . ( quietly ) : Oh ... Now , Tom Holliday , you have got to find her . If you don 't find her , I will . Now , Hank , you turned in your badge two years ago . I can still out-sheriff you any day . ( quietly ) : Yeah . Well , this young lady that you 're accusing- - did you get a look at her ? No . Well , did anyone see her ? I did . I saw her standing right over there by the front desk . That 's all right . Let that man through . What 's your name ? John Corwin . You were in this lobby this morning ? About an hour ago- - I came in to use the cigarette machine . That young lady that was talking to Hattie- - what did she look like ? Hank , I 'll handle this . She wasn 't exactly a young lady . She must 've been at least ... 45 . Big woman . And you got a good look at her ? She had a lot of blonde frizzy hair piled high on top of her head . Mr. Corwin , I think you 'd better come down to headquarters with me . I 'm going to want all the details . Hank , if that , uh , David Vincent fella turns up , you let me know right away . All right , folks , the show is over . On your way . Move along . Right over here . Just a minute , sir- - I 'm trying to get someone to spell me here at the board . Take your time . Sycamore . Uh , David Vincent , please . Vincent ? David Vincent ? Yes . Is he there ? Now , wait a minute . That 's for me . I 'm David Vincent . You can take that phone over there in the lobby . Hello ? Hello . Mr. Vincent ? Yes . This is Anne Gibbs . What 's wrong ? You sound upset . Well , I am . I ... I can 't meet you at the hotel . I ... I better not go near the town . Where are you ? Uh ... at an antique shop- - Shelter Point Antique Shop . It 's , uh , on the main highway about three miles north of Arbor City . All right , stay there . I 'm leaving right now . Mr. Vincent ? Yes . I 'm Anne Gibbs . Can we talk inside ? Are you sure you weren 't followed ? They don 't know I 'm in the area . They know more than you realize . You , uh , seem to be very familiar with them . I should be . I 'm one of them . I 'm very fond of that myself . It 's very attractive . Shelter Point Antiques . Meet me here . I 'm not like the others . That 's why they want to destroy me . I 'm a threat to them . What do you mean ? They 've been experimenting with human emotions . I 'm one of their failures . When I get angry , I ... I lose control- - I get violent ... wild . I don 't believe you . A woman was murdered this morning ... at the hotel . Are you telling me you did it ? She wasn 't the first . That 's why they want to destroy me . I 'm a danger to them . If your police should ever capture me , they 'll find out I 'm from another world . David , please help me . Why should I ? Because I can help you . I can tell you what you want to know about the invasion . I could go with you to your government and tell them why we 're here . In other words , you 're selling out . I don 't buy it . I 'm not turning against them . They turned against me . I 'm not one of them anymore . My life has become valuable to me . It could be to you . Wait here . I have to make a phone call . Yes , operator . A collect call to New York- - person-to-person to Mr. Edgar Scoville . S-c-o-v-i-l-l-e . Scoville Electronics , New York City . Hi . Be with you in just a minute . Now , you were talking about the Florentine style . Here 's a clock I think you 'd be very interested in . I got this on a trade so it 's pretty reasonable right now . Very attractive , isn 't it ? I 'm sure she 's telling the truth and she 's willing to go to Washington with us . We have to move fast . All right , David . I 'll bring a helicopter to pick you up . But we can 't possibly GET THERE BEFORE 3 : 00 . That 's a long time to stay out of sight . The aliens are after her and so are the police . The police ? Now , you know this area . Where can we hide out ? Hold on a minute . Would you like to see what I have outside ? Oh , David . Charlie McKay has a summer camp in Cape View . That 's not too far from Arbor City . Good . Will you call him ? I 'm not sure it 's a good idea , especially if the police are involved . We don 't have time to be choosy . We know we can trust him . All right , I 'll set things up . Start looking for us at about 3 : 00 . There 's a baseball field there . All right , I 'll see you then . Excuse me . How far is it to Cape View ? Cape View ? That 's about 70 , 75 miles . This highway takes you right to it . It 's a fabulous drive . Thanks . Oh , have you seen anything here that interests you ? Still looking . You all right ? Let 's go . Sure there 's nothing I can help you with ? No , thank you . Well , be sure to come back . Our pewter sale begins next Monday . ( car engine starting ) ( tires squealing ) Hey , you , hold on ! That 's funny . He told us to meet him here . Hello . Oh , hi there , Mr. Willis . Hi . That young couple that just left here- - do you know them ? Should I ? Are they , uh , some kind of fugitives ? Why would you say a thing like that ? Do you know something ? I 'd better call the sheriff . Just a minute . I was sheriff here for over 20 years and anything you can tell Halloway , you can tell me . Well , now you wouldn 't want me to get in trouble with the law , would you , Mr. Willis ? Besides , Sheriff Halloway , he 's one of my best customers . Well ... how much ? Oh , that ... 98 cents . There you are , ten dollars . I , uh , don 't have any change . I thought so . Where did they go ? Cape View . Are you sure ? I just gave them directions . You save this for Sheriff Halloway when he retires . Buying some antiques , Mr. Willis ? WILLIS : Never mind . I found this in your station wagon . The grief-stricken husband seeking revenge . Give that to me . Why , you must know something the sheriff doesn 't know . I know you told a lie about that woman . Fat , 40 , blonde , frizzly hair . You 've seen her ? Maybe . Mr. Willis ... I lied to the sheriff for a good reason . I want him busy elsewhere . This case is bigger than anyone realizes . Justice Department . Special Investigator . Oh , say , you know Orrin Jacoby ? He 's with the Justice Department . Used to be my deputy four or five years ago . Where 's the girl , Mr. Willis ? This is not cops and robbers anymore . This is national security . She 's gone to Cape View with David Vincent . You 've done your job , Mr. Willis . Now stay out of it . We will not tolerate interference from anyone . You understand that . Is the camp open this time of year ? No . Professor McKay and his son live there . He 's a retired geologist . Do they know about ... ? Aliens ? Oh , yes . They know about aliens . Charlie and his wife were on a field trip once . They ran across an alien outpost . Your friends began chasing them for miles . Charlie was driving like a madman . The car went out of control . He had a head-on collision with another car . His wife and the other driver were killed . He was convicted of manslaughter . He just finished 18 months in prison . Why ? It wasn 't his fault . What could he tell them ? Creatures from another planet were chasing him ? Does Professor McKay know that I 'm an ... alien ? I 'm sure Scoville told him . David , I-I don 't want to go to that camp . They 're expecting us . A helicopter is meeting us there to take us to Washington . David , my people turned his life into a nightmare . How can you expect him to help me ? By helping you , we hope to end this nightmare . That 's what this is all about . I 'm not going to that camp . You 're in no position to be dictating terms . What do you mean ? Figure it out for yourself . You killed my people , and your people don 't want you . Stop the car . No chance . Stop the car ! I 'm getting out ! No , no . I 'm getting out ! No ! I 'm not your prisoner ! I 'm nobody 's prisoner ! Now you know what I 'm like . Dad , I ... Eddie , I asked you to start the fire . Sorry , Dad . Won 't things get warm enough without it ? Mr. Scoville is landing his helicopter on the playing field . I hope there aren 't too many gopher holes . Maybe we 'll need them to hide in if the police show up . They won 't . Are you sure ? She 's running from the cops . If they find her here , you ... It 's a calculated risk . You 're the one with a record . You 're the one who might go back to prison . Nobody seems to care about that . I don 't want her here , Dad . She ... Eddie , simmer down . I know how you feel . Maybe I feel that way , too , but ... it 'll be okay . Okay ? Well , David . Hello , Charles . It 's good to see you again . Good to see you . Come in . Anne Gibbs , Charles McKay . Miss Gibbs and Mr. Vincent , my son , Eddie . Hello , Ed . Sit down , please . May I get you a drink ? No , thank you . Is there someplace I can hide the car ? I 'd feel better if it were out of sight . By all means . Eddie , will you show Mr. Vincent where he can hide his car ? I 'll show him nothing . He 's got no right putting your life on the line like this . Show him , Eddie . My apologies , Miss Gibbs . My son is a bit overprotective . He 's just more honest than the rest of us . One of the privileges of youth . You have that same privilege , Professor . I think you already know my opinion of you . I 'm a little surprised you came here . Well , it wasn 't my idea . Believe it or not , I don 't think I have the right to expect you to help me . I don 't believe you . I think I 'd better leave . You 're not going anywhere . Not until we tell you to . You have no right to keep me here . Haven 't I ? I paid for the right , Miss Gibbs , with my wife , my leg , my career . Now , you sit down . Get away from that door . No chance . Get away from that door ! No ! ( yelling ) Dad . David , help me . Now do you see ? She killed him . Eddie ! He 's still alive . Get some water . Can 't be too many places to hide around here . Check them all . ( moaning ) He 's coming to . We better go . I 'm not leaving him . He 'll have plenty of company any minute now . I 'm sure his son warned every cop in the county . But I 'm not leaving till he 's all right . Look , Scoville 's helicopter is due in 40 minutes . We have to avoid the police and your people during that time . You know , sometimes I think you 're less human than I am . You 're perfectly willing to just leave him here ? I didn 't hit him , and I didn 't kill anyone , so don 't give me lectures on humanity . All right ? David . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry about everything . Trouble ? There 's been a murder at the Cape View Camp . My father . Oh , I 'm , uh , sorry , uh ... is the sheriff on it ? He 's up at Pine Ridge . They just radioed him . He 's on his way in . Any idea who did it ? A woman . Know her name ? Anne Gibbs . Where can I find her ? Last I heard , she was waiting for a helicopter to pick her up . To take her to Washington . Pick her up where ? At the camp . The playing field . Don 't worry , son , we 'll take over . With this tail wind , we ought to make it in 20 minutes . That 's Arbor City just below . Hank . Yeah . You found that killer yet ? Hank , we 're going to need a signed statement about what happened over here this morning from you . There 's a murderer running around loose and you 're worrying about statements . We think we 've got her identified . Name is Anne Gibbs . You sure ? It just came over the wire . Attempted murder over in Cape View . She and that David Vincent fellow . While you 're standing around here letting the grass grow under your feet . Hank , you know that 's not in my jurisdiction . That girl could kill a dozen people before you get started . Hank , we 're working on it . There 's a report of a helicopter going to pick them up and take them to Washington . Maybe I will just , uh .. run over there and check that out . Listen , you need help down in Washington , DC , I got good connections . No , thanks . Now , listen , you know my old deputy , Orrin Jacoby . He 's a big muckety-muck with the Justice Department . Hank , I can handle this . Now , you just file that statement , all right ? Kate , get me the long distance operator . I want to talk to Washington , DC . Faster . That 's him . Anne ? I 'm sorry it 's been so tough on you . When you get to Washington , we 'll see that you 're treated better . There 's some very important people waiting to meet you . Some of ours and some of hers . My wife 's cousin has a place just outside of Washington . We 'll stay away from the airports . Land in an open field someplace . The Justice Department 's lined up a meeting with half a dozen top people . We can pick any of 20 different routes into Washington . There 's no way they can stop us now . Now sit back . Enjoy the scenery . This is Corwin . I want you to contact the Washington tracking station . That helicopter coming in from Virginia- - I want to know exactly where it lands . ( beeping ) Corwin . MALE VOICE : The helicopter landed 40 minutes ago in a field 27 miles southwest of Washington . Every man in the area is being made available to you . Wally ? Edgar Scoville . Sorry to wake you at this ungodly hour . No , I 'm all right . We landed a while ago in Fairfax . Wally , I 've got a job for you . It 's confidential , it 's urgent and it must be done by 6 : 00 A.M. I want you to go to the motor pool at our Washington plant ... ( radio playing violin solo ) ( turns off radio ) Good morning . At 3 : 55 this morning , a helicopter landed in Fairfax Park . One of your taxis went into the park empty and came out with three persons . I want to know where your cab took those passengers and I haven 't got much time . See anything ? Car should be here at 6 : 00 sharp . Just a few more minutes . Will we go straight to Washington ? Direct to your official meeting . Let me get you some more coffee . Think of it- - you 're about to become the most important woman in two worlds . Will you be with me , David ? At the meeting ? Wouldn 't miss it . It frightens me ... " the most important woman in two worlds " and I don 't fit into either . ( honks horn ) Truck 's here . Let 's go . Uh-uh . Back door . ( honks ) An old green sedan , license 2-6-J-9-O-4 , driving north to Hudson Boulevard . ( car approaching ) ( gunshot ) Get help . Get behind that car . David ! I 'm giving myself up . No . Let her go . All right , now , let 's all go quietly . Stop it ! We 'll cover you in case any more of them show up . The last mile . How do you feel ? Nervous . No , worse ... scared . They 're waiting . All right , let 's go . ( groans ) She killed my wife . David ... David ... David ... Did you see that ? Did you see that ? Tell them what you saw . Go on , tell them ! Do you think I convinced them ? Half a dozen people testified how she died . They can 't think you 're all cranks . I was a sheriff for over 20 years . They can 't think I 'm a crank . It 's a rotten shame . She could have ended this nightmare once and for all . She could have helped every one of us . The whole human race . If he hadn 't been so damned human . NARRATOR : Eyewitness testimony to the presence of the invader , another piece in the mosaic and soon the picture that David Vincent sees there will be seen by all . Today , the road ahead seems not quite so steep .

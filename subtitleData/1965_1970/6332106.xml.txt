 Studio ' Youth ' presents The Mysterious Wall Attention ! First camera on . Good . Is Camera 2 ready ? - Yes . Full lights ! Put the mic closer . Good , thank you . Attention , we 're on air . Are you ready ? - Ready . The next page of our TV Journal we called ' The Mysterious Wall ' . We 've invited a team of researchers to tell you all about this mysterious phenomenon . Please . I think , we shall hear Andrei Erdeli , the chief of the expedition studying the wall , who 's flying to the place of events in the next few days . Mr. Erdeli , I 've heard there 's already an expedition working there ? Yes , they were gathering preliminary evidence . If I 'm not mistaken , Professor Lomov is running it ? - Yes . Mr. Erdeli , so what is this wall , in general ? The wall has appeared only recently . It was discovered accidentally by a geological team . They said , the wall appeared out of nowhere and encircled them , for two days isolating them from the world . Excuse me , a question : what does it look like ? I haven 't been there yet . They say , it 's like a thunder cloud with lightning . I 'm sorry for the interruption , please continue . The geologists couldn 't break the circle . The wall carries a very high electrical charge . Highly dangerous for people . Yes . You can 't walk through the wall . More-so , the geologists couldn 't use their radio . The wall blocks radio waves . In two days it disappeared . The geologists notified Moscow about the incident . And in a couple of hours it appeared again , and keeps appearing and disappearing at the same time and the same place . Our guests have brought us some tapes made by the Lomov group . Let 's hear them . Please . That 's the wall 's background noise . That 's the sound it makes when appearing . This noise appears at the most unexpected times . We do not know it 's origin . Very interesting . What did Lomov find out ? The team managed to measure the temperature of the wall 's surface . To count the time it appears and disappears . They built a scientific station inside the circle . They are building a settlement near , gathering the equipment . And what are Lomov 's thoughts on the nature of the wall ? None yet . You must understand , it 's been not so long . Is it true that Professor Lomov thinks that the Wall was sent here by the inhabitants of some other planet ? It is so . He 's sure that the wall is the work of an extraterrestrial civilization . Something like our automatic stations that we send to the Moon , Mars or Venus . But as yet there 's no proof of such a theory . Science deals in facts . Lomov 's assumptions seem to me purely fantastical . Mr. Erdeli , what do you think ? I think , the wall is a place where electro-magnetic fields gather . Like a giant ball lightning , an absolutely natural thing . There are other theories . Its energy is too big for Earth , it may very well be a message from space . But not necessarily created by aliens . No , not necessarily . The wall doesn 't look like any interplanetary communication , that we seem to think so much about lately . It 'd be much easier to communicate via radio or with a laser ray . It takes a lot of energy to build a wall like this . I see you haven 't reached a consensus yet . It takes time . - Another question : Is it true that the wall affects the psyche of a person and causes hallucinations ? I haven 't been there and couldn 't witness the wall 's mysterious qualities . Dear viewers , let 's thank our great scientists who are standing on the verge of new discoveries . The next page of our TV Journal is Sport . Now , Leningrad . Print it . Switch off the lights , leave the duty ones . Sergei , reel in the cable . Tell me now ... Is Lovom 's theory complete gibberish ? Lomov is a serious scientist . Excuse me . I didn 't mean to hurt anyone , but you are recalling him , aren 't you ? He just needs to rest . I won 't take any more of your time , goodbye . - Goodbye . Goodbye , thank you . This wall story is getting anecdotal . I could never imagine Lomov becoming a prisoner of his childhood dreams . Is there news from him ? - No , he hasn 't sent anything for a week . What 's with the equipment ? - He said he doesn 't need anything . He took an active sonar , modified it in some way ... There will be problems . Andrei Iraklievich , excuse me . You do have your plane ticket already ? - Yes . I know Professor Lomov is your friend . Do not take it all too close to your heart . Try to gently explain the situation to him . Good luck . - All the best . Lena ? Hello . I didn 't have time to call you , you know what happened ? Ah , you were watching the TV . They suggest Lomov takes a rest , I 'm in a ridiculous situation . Tomorrow . I leave tomorrow . A permit ? For you ? Behind the wall ? You 'll see him soon , he 'll be in Moscow in a couple of days . You too are interested in the wall ? Our drivers say this wall was built by Martians ! Martians ? - Martians . Andrei , what if it 's true ? Ok-ok , I stop . - Or maybe they lie . Martians are the first thing we need here . We just can 't cope without Martians . Why , why do you need Martians ? How do you mean , why ? - Well , why ? Well , you know ... Or , well , we can do without them . That 's what I think . But Lomov thinks differently . Doesn 't he , Lena ? We will leave on Friday , cause there 's no life on Mars . And you , what are you to comrade Lomov ? His fianc√© . - A hero . Who is ? - Comrade Lomov . He spent three months under the dome , and they used to switch people every day . Many people go crazy , say the wall draws them . Going to the village ? - Yes . Take the sergeant there . - Yes , sir . He needs to get behind the wall to see Lomov . There was an accident . Is Lomov all right ? Calm down , no casualties reported . Are these the scientists ? - Yes . Are you closing him down ? - Don 't know . - If yes , good . We 've had enough . The general entrusted him with the gear , let him use it , and now the accident . Science can 't do without the military . Karpukhin ! Our sonar operator . Repeat your orders . - Check the sonar , prepare it for transportation . Right . I 'll come on Wednesday with the General . Do you understand the responsibility ? - Yes , sir . May I go now ? - Yes . 53 minutes till the wall appears . Is it your first time behind the wall , sergeant ? Yes , sir , first time . Me , too . And I could go to Jakarta to the conference . Great route . Delhi , Calcutta , Bangkok , Hong Kong . Hong Kong is a trifle . - What ? I say , it 's trifle . - Have you been there ? - I have . Why trifle ? - No bananas . When we were heading for Hong Kong on a tanker , I was in the merchant fleet . It was good , romantic . We were saving a foreign writer there . Singapore is another thing . They have special monkeys guarding the bananas . And collecting them . I brought such a monkey to my mom . Where is it now ? She gave it away , it was getting on her nerves . We are here . The village . Good evening , comrades . Andrei Iraklievich Erdeli ? The new chief of the expedition ? - Good evening . Your papers ? You 'll spend four days behind the wall with Lomov . Your people and the equipment are on their way . What 's with Lomov ? - His group left . He 'll give you the papers and leave too . Hello . I 'm Fokin . - Show our comrades the way . It 's 37 min till the wall . '37 minutes before the appearance of the wall Break a leg ! - Thanks . Good evening . Do you have matches ? - We have everything . They say Petrov the carpenter had a vision behind the wall . The forest disappeared . And suddenly he 's at his daughter 's wedding , and it was two years ago . His daughter is wearing a white dress . And he 's still in his sheepskin and valenkis . He poured himself a glass of vodka , and then everything disappeared . - Shame . Shame on you , and Lomov . Wanna pollute science with mysticism ? We won 't let you . Such stories are the result of your idealistic attitude to the phenomena of nature . Devils , goblins , witches , Martians . '33 minutes before the appearance of the wall Andrei Iraklievich , 33 min . - Are you Erdeli ? Now everybody is here . Let 's go . Comrade , let the boy go . Why do you need him , he 's a good boy , a scout . You should thank us , we may have saved your kids from death . We keep catching kids who want to get under the dome . Hello . Hello . Everybody here ? - Yes . We are here . You will have to go by foot to the area of the wall . Along the road leading to the station , there are special accompanying automats . You 'll have to walk fast , the wall will appear in 31 min . Have you filled out Form 17 ? - We did . Remember everything ? - Yes . Good ? - Good . Recite it . - But why , dear comrade ? Kids , go home . Recite Form 17 . Inside the perimeter of the wall there is an automatic warning system . Miss , continue . - You know ... Continue . The moment somebody crosses the warning system there will be an alarm . - Enough . Now you , young man . The system protects members of the expedition when they work close to the wall . It is prohibited to cross the line of detectors without a permit . Enough . Here are the indicators . Sign for them . You 're a bureaucrat . I am . That 's my value . '27 minutes before the appearance of the wall '26 minutes before the appearance of the wall Lena , stay here . Sergeant , where are you ? Sergeant ! Where did he go ? Who 's there ? - Us , the Martians . You came too ? - To take you back . - Hi , Lomov . Hello , Andrei . - You do understand why I 'm here ? - I do . Who 's that ? - The sonar operator , the military sent him . Sergeant Karpukhin reporting for duty . - Not so official . Name ? Valentin . Valya . You 'll take the sonar away ? - Yes , sir . Too bad . - What happened here ? Look here . The pictures : a circle , a square . A man . - A man ? We 've added a thing to the sonar and transmitted these pictures inside the wall . They say we do it anyway , so we decided to try . And ? - The sonar broke down . My assistant got his hands burned . - That 's all ? Yep . - Good . That 's Irtysh , he doesn 't bite . '25 minutes before ... " My people come on Friday , when the wall is gone . I 'll look around till then . Egor , I must tell you that there 'll be some serious research . Well , where does the wall come from ? - I don 't know . It 's difficult to work with . You can 't come close . Can 't take any probes . Every instrument gets burned . - Too bad . Valya , you can stay upstairs , Lena , you 're here . Andrei , you 'll have a great room when I leave . Really ? What a mess ! Sergeant , take your clothes off . - Thank you . Let me look at you under the lights . Why do you look so bad ? - Have you brought something tasty ? Fresh tomatoes . - Where from ? - Doctor , you forget it 's spring elsewhere . We 've brought letters . The scientific community waits for you . Where 's the bag ? Are you going to unpack for two days ? There 's a woman here . Get the glasses . You work too much . And you , on Earth , thought that we do nothing behind the wall ? On Earth ? That 's funny . - It 's been three months for me . I 'm crazy . Am I crazy , Lena ? - Of course . Your towel is under the bed . Well , when will the wall appear ? In 4,5 minutes . I wanna take a look . - Stop ! I ask you not to leave the house till morning . You could get lost . Where 's the sweater ? - Which one ? The one I gave you as a present . There . - Where ' there ' ? When the wall disappears , the radio turns on and I communicate with the Earth . At this time there 's always a ' Pionerskaya Zor 'ka ' on . If I didn 't have any information , and just now appeared on Earth , I would think that it 's a planet of kids and musicians . Interesting , isn 't it ? - Very much so . One minute left . - You can 't see it from the window . The wall ... - No , there 'll be a signal . The warning system is on . Now ? Let 's drink , then . To our meeting . Will it always be so bright ? While the wall is there , yes . - How do we sleep ? Water 's in the kitchen , sleeping pills are in the first-aid kit . Why aren 't you sleeping ? - Don 't want to . Nobody sleeps here the first night . Tell me , Lena ... - What ? What do you think of it ? You mean , the Martians ? - Not necessarily . Just the intelligent creatures from other solar systems . You mean , aliens ? You know , now everything has to do with aliens . Whatever happens , it must be the aliens . Strange drawings in a desert ? Who made them ? Aliens . Spots in the sky ? Aliens in their flying saucers . Are you serious about it ? - It 's been three months . But nothing happened in three months . Today I did what I should 've done long ago . Transmitted information inside . Dots and squares ? - Yes , the drawings . Vasya conducted the transmission , and I stood right beside him . During the transmission , there was a fire on the surface of the wall . The ones near the sonar saw it , I only felt that it was moving . Then the console sparked , and Vasya got his hands burned . It was so unexpected , we didn 't have time to take photos . It 's only you I can tell . - Wait , you think the wall answered ? I don 't know . What if it was just a malfunction of the sonar ? What if you got tired after three months , and are now seeing things ? Can it be ? - Yes . But I don 't want to leave . Shall we come closer ? - To the wall ? Together . Interesting to see it up close . What 's the noise ? - Ah , nothing . Just walking and smoking . Sergeant guards me . I asked you not to leave the house . - What , were there some troubles ? - No . You shouldn 't have brought Lena , she 's tired , it 's her vacation . I 'm leaving . - Listen . Am I your friend ? - Yes . Whatever happens ? - Yes , yes . You see , I didn 't want to come . - I get it . Listen to me . That philosophy of yours ... Do you live in this world ? - I do . You live , you 're 35 years old . - 37 . Ok , 37 . You have legs ... You have hands , and I hope a head too . - Well ? She loves you . Marry her , what more do you need ? Go to the sea , to Sukhumi , it 's spring there , roses bloom . Stop it , go to sleep . - Ok , let 's go inside . What about you ? - I 'll take a walk . Andrei Iraklievitch . When I used to work in the merchant fleet One of our workers used to tell stories about the flying saucers . His brother-in-law saw one . He was on his way to Sochi , the train stopped , and the saucers landed on a 3 square km field . Why tell me ? - Just came to my mind . They say , the aliens took one Polish comrade before the war . Then brought him back , to Poland . - Bullshit . Many people do not believe . He should 've taken something from there . For proof . - Do you want guests from space ? Who doesn 't ? There 's a very slight possibility . Intelligent life is only on Earth . And the next star is a couple light years away . It 's easier for two dust specks to meet at the Bolshoi . Two specks of dust do not have reason to meet . Why the hell would they meet ? You 're lucky , you 'll go to Sukhumi , to swim in the sea . What 's that ? - It 's soap , my dear . You 'll eat khachapuri at the restaurant on the mountain . I 'll give you a note . Why do you think we 'll go to Sukhumi ? - You will , Lena . Believe me . - Take a seat . There 's a wedding outside . Lot 's of guests . I 've never seen your wife . She 's a beauty . Lives in the village . Brings up our son in the fresh air . Egor ! Valya , where 's Egor ? I don 't know . - Interesting . Lomov ! Lomov ! May I ? - You up already ? What are you doing ? - Well , soldering . Is it broken ? Yes , and I want to repair it , cause it 's my responsibility . It 's ok , sergeant will do it . Andrei , I have a request . Let me stay for a couple of days . It 's enough for you . Do you refuse me as a new boss ? - Oh , come on . Do you know something others don 't ? - No . Egor , get this . If it really is aliens , they still won 't understand your pictures . Why 's that ? Because they may be totally different to us . Small as ants , or big as clouds . What if the wall IS an alien ? Will you eat ? - Later . Comrade Lomov , I 'll go work on the sonar . Andrei told me that we are going to Sukhumi , is it true ? It is , Lena . Valya ! Well ? I checked it . Can 't find the sparks that you saw , it seems to be ok . It 's ok ? - Egor Petrovich . You better not . What if , again ... - What again ? You 'll go to Moscow on Friday , and I 'll have a general with an inspection . Well , if so ... I get it , sergeant . - Comrade Lomov . I share your theories . I still need to finish here . If there 's still time , I 'll be glad to let you work . I 'll tell you . Hi . Give me a paw . Have you seen the whale ? His head 's like this . Give me a paw . Oh , well . ( recites a Russian nursery rhyme ) How did I get here ? Comrade boatswain , am I dreaming ? Help me ! Help me ! Be quick , help me ! I know , we 're on route from Melbourne to Vladivostok . It this the Yellow Sea ? - Yes , yes . Why am I dry , and he 's wet ? What 's happening ? It 's a dream ! My cat is still there ! Lift ! Lift ! My cat is there ! He 'll die ! - He won 't . We saved you two years ago , I remember . I need to cross the ocean . Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? It 's still 500 miles . - Parlez-vous Francais ? I 'm from Canada , I 'm writing a book on man 's solitude . Ah , do you speak English ? - Yes . I 'm from Canada . - Do you want answers , sir , aren 't you ? You 're very kind , gentlemen , thank you . But I need to be in my tub . As you like . - Who 's he ? He speaks English . Don 't understand . I do . Do I dream you ? I dream all of you . It very well may be . Why did you rescue me ? - You gave the S.O.S. signal . I thought nobody would hear me , I was alone in the ocean . Listen , aren 't you a Martian ? - No . I 'm nobody , I 'm alone in the ocean . Although , it 's very beautiful . A Martian ? Yes , I am . For you , I 'm a Martian . We do not understand each other . For you , I 'm a Martian . We 're all Martians . We 're all naked in the ocean . The captain will come and sort it all out . What 's to sort out , he 's a Martian . The world is impregnated with strontium . The air , the land , the sea shells . Strontium everywhere . And nobody can understand what kind of a wall divides people . Who are you ? I 'm a writer , I 'm writing a book on how a man is alone . I see . Spread out , now ! I 've crossed the English Channel on an ironing-board . Don 't touch . I love him because he hates the ocean . A tub ? - A tub . A cat . - A cat . A tanker . - Yes . Listen , tell me what 's happening . Let me through , please . You still won 't understand what I 'm saying . He eats ! - Everything around us is a dream . We will never understand each other . We just have to meet and talk . - What for ? Poor cat . Monster ! People are as far from each other as the stars in the sky . - Bullshit ! It 's not true . You were drowning , and we were near . You cried for help . And we saved you . So you are not right . - Propaganda ! Hey , it 's very in now , take it . Yeah , it 's for you . - Well , ok . Propaganda . Time to go . Heave ho ! Stop . Ciao ! Ciao ! Comrade Lomov ! Martians ! You were right ! What are you talking about ? - Aliens ! We must prepare ourselves , they could be here any minute . Who are ' they ' ? - I know , I know ! .. You 're holding back . I 'm sure we can negotiate with them . They say you can 't enter the wall , and they draw you nevertheless . Calm down , Karpukhin ! - They messed with my head . I made contact with them ! Did you finish checking the sonar ? - You don 't believe me ! No , I don 't ! Fool , I 'm a fool ! I should have taken something as a proof . Now it 's like that Polish man ... Why 's the sonar smoking ? - My coat might be burning . It doesn 't matter . We must prepare for the meeting . You really don 't believe me . But it happened . It did . Come on . And you didn 't believe me . You hear that ? - It works . I 'll try to repeat transmission . - How did it start ? I drew a ship , wanted to transmit , and then I was at sea . Is it to do with the transmission ? Of course ! - Let me try ! - Wait ! I know , I know . - Wait , let me try . I say , let me ! - Come on , wait ! Egor ! When I gave my lecture in the observatory , one boy asked me about the wall . What did you answer ? - Nothing . Told him it was a subject matter for the high school . The Martians , hallucinations , Form 17 ... the warning system . I don 't get it . - Hold the screwdriver . Andrei , what if the wall really draws people to it ? Let 's go and try . - No , I won 't go . But why ? - Just so . I went outside yesterday , and the sergeant with me , we were looking at the wall . It doesn 't look like a storm cloud . Andrei , you don 't believe in aliens . Let 's get closer . Maybe something will become clear . You think you 'll go alone if need be . What if it 's the wall that makes you come closer ? Bullshit . The engine is dead , the sonar , too . We did something wrong . Did you have such visions , too ? I did . You say bullshit , and still Lomov waits for something . See , the telephone . You didn 't answer my question . Telephones are everywhere here . He put it here in case something happens , but didn 't get a single call in 3 months . Andrei , will we go to the wall ? - Don 't joke about it . We need to find more places for detectors . I have this much to do . You must be afraid ... - I am . ... that it will draw you . I want to tell you something . Either go with me , or I go alone . - Lena , listen . I came here , and here I sometimes think Lomov is right . What ? - No , seriously . You have a strange sense of humor , great . You see the wall ? See me approach it . Lena ! - I 'm going , it draws me . Lena ! Lena ! Stop hugging me . Andrei , come back immediately . Do you hear me ? Andrei ! - Go to the station , take this road . I 'll pick up the sledge and come , too . Lena , go back to the house . ( The Georgian song . ) 'Andrei , come back immediately . Andrei , do you hear me ? ' 'Andrei ! ' ( They speak Georgian . ) ( Still Georgian . ) Good afternoon , uncle Georgiy . Hello , you grew up ! Let 's drink ! Why are you here , uncle Georgiy ? I work . Somebody has to . Why don 't you ask me anything ? - What ? You 're too young for me to ask you things . You have to ask me . - But uncle ... It 's no use talking to you . What do you know about the wall ? Why are you here ? So many questions ! You better look how the grapes grow . The sun is shining . We 're drinking wine . Why the grapes ? Why the sun ? Why the wine ? Why does the accountant lie to women ? Why do they want to retire me ? Why did you leave for Moscow and visit your wife as a guest ? You 're a scientist . Why not work as an accountant ? - I dream you , uncle . You 're my hallucination , you are the things I remember about you . You never used to talk like this . - I always used to talk like this ! But you didn 't listen , you lot never listen ! - Who are you , old man ? Do you understand what I 'm asking ? You may call me the Martian , if you like . Why do you cling to this old planet , I don 't get it ! [ undecipherable ] Let 's drink ! How do you do it ? - You won 't understand . Cause you 're afraid . You 're a coward ! 'Sector 5 alarm ! ' 'A person approaching the wall . ' Stop ! - Sergeant ! Why are you here ? - You were approaching the wall ! Lomov sent me , cause you weren 't answering the phone . Yes . It 's ok . I found him . Yes , sir . Be back in a minute . You 're a strange person . First you believe nothing , then you do , and become afraid . You just went in the wrong direction , no big deal . Comrade Lomov , we are here . - Great . Andrei , it 's time for you to take over , as a new boss . It 's not the best time for jokes . - I 'm not joking , and I feel great . Where were you ? - The forest . Why didn 't you answer the phone ? - Didn 't hear . Did you have hallucinations too ? - It wasn 't hallucinations . Great , I 'll write it down . Andrei Iraklievich , did you take anything for proof ? Sit down , look through the papers . - What papers ? I prepared everything , you only have to sign . The sonar , every time we transmit something into the wall , there 's an accident . Then , the electric station . - What 's about it ? Burned down . Then , when did it start with you ? - What ? The ' not hallucinations ' . - I don 't know . Haven 't you looked at the watch ? - No . - Pity . Valya , where did you find comrade Erdeli ? By the warning system 's detectors . God , Andrei , were you going to enter the wall ? Then you 'll have to sign this paper , it very important . Why the bureaucracy ? I gather facts , otherwise no one will believe me . Valya , sign here , please . - My pleasure . We need to get out of here as soon as possible . I 'm sure it won 't happen today , and it won 't happen to me . But with my future great-great - grandchildren . We are not ready . I do not agree . - It will end catastrophically . There are aliens near us , maybe even Martians . We couldn 't find any canals on Mars , but still . I think they dried up only recently . The inhabitants of Mars suffer from thirst . So they sent their representatives , so we 'd give them our helping hand ! Wouldn 't we ? Well ? - What Martians ! Does nobody understand what 's happening here ? We 're encircled by the wall , it 's under current . It burns trees , it draws people , it messes with our heads ! Before Friday , we 'll all try to get into it . The question is : who will be the first . I 'll go feed the dog . Comrades . I have a suggestion . We must repair the electric station . - What for ? I want the sonar to work again . - Don 't do it . First your assistant , then Valya . We have to wait till Friday , and ask for advice . You don 't understand anything . I don 't , either . Why do you talk to her like this ? Why do you need the sonar ? - I can 't sit still till Friday . What if it disappears forever ? What if the next time they try to reach us is in a thousand years ? If only . The only thing you await from this meeting , is new problems for people . That 's why you 're afraid to believe in their existence . I won 't be around in a thousand years , I want to try to talk to them now . How ? These visions are the key . It may be the only way they can communicate with us . The wall makes us remember the things that we lived through . It takes us to the past . - What for ? By studying our memories , they kind of see the Earth with our eyes . They find out a lot more ... - Don 't you think that ... these visions could be the result of electromagnetic radiation ? An unstudied phenomenon . - Maybe . Radiation , or ball lightning , or something different . It could be anything . But what if I 'm right , and not you ? What are you going to do next ? I want to pick up their own memories . Whose memories ? The ones that created the wall . I want to see their world the way they see ours . I want them to remember something , for me to study it . Wow . How are going to do it ? With the sonar ? Funny , but yes . Every time during the transmission they burn something . Maybe they don 't believe that we can understand each other . So I 'll keep sending the signals into the wall . Till they show me the right way . Or till you burn in that sonar . - I won 't . - You sure ? - Yes . They had the chance to burn me . I see , you did think it through . Today is Friday . I can 't believe it 's been two days . It feels like a hundred years . Will Lomov eat ? - Yeah , he 's coming . We 're almost finished , a 30 min job left . Elena Yurievna , do you , by any chance , know what a lingua-helmet is ? Lingua ... What ? It could be useful . Here . ' His big forehead and deep-set eyes proved his high intelligence . ' - What ? ' ... proved his high intelligence . ' 'The creature moved with the help of a device that looked 'like a bicycle but without the wheels ... ' Listen up ! It 's very interesting . Egor . This is a book for you . 'There he is , the mysterious inhabitant of the planet 'Hrr , Trrr , Prr ' , it said friendly . 'How are we gonna understand him ' , Sidorov asked anxiously . ' 'Sidorov always doubted everything . ' 'You forgot the lingua-helmet ' , said the captain . ' - Yes , this word . 'The captain put the lingua-helmet on his head 'Turned the software 's beta lever 'And now the voice of the violet creature 'sounded in his head as pure Russian . ' - Lena , stop it . 'What 's your planet ' name ? translated the captain . ' You 're the captain , aren 't you ? 'The Earth ' , the captain answered proudly 'The Earth ' , the violet creature repeated . ' 'Hooray ' , Johnson screamed 'How does ' The Earth ' sound in your language ? , asked the captain 'putting the second lingua-helmet on the head of the creature . ' 'Hrrr , Trrr , Prrr ' , said the creature 'and pointed his tentacles into the clear sky . ' 'Hrrr , Trrr , Prrr sounds nice ' , said Johnson . ' Egor , where are your beta levers ? Where is your lingua-helmet ? I , too , want to talk to the violet creatures . Andrei , look at his eyes . - Calm down , Lena ! Valya , we have work to do . Are you waiting for me ? Is that you who 's waiting for me ? Me . I 'll ask you some questions . - Please do . 'Temperature and pressure are ok What is the wall ? - The wall ? What wall ? Are you crazy ? ( Some scientific calculations In the background ) What ? - ' The wall of trees 'The wall of rain , the wall of fog ( Reads some proverbs with the wall in it ) ( Some more . ) She knows too much . You can 't stop her now . It 's a malfunction , I tell you . - Well ? Borya , ask your machine a question : 'How to understand each other ? ' Boys , the boss asks how to understand each other . What 's it again ? 'How to understand each other ? ' How to understand each other ? - How ... To . Understand . Each . Other . 'You live on Earth' 'There are three radiation belts around it 'The Earth gravity , the Sun gravity and the Moon gravity . ' 'Some time ago you invented a stone axe . ' 'And a nuclear bomb . There 's a fog by the wall . ' You can 't enter the wall . - What if I try ? 'People of Earth speak 2500 languages 'Capitalism , colonialism , materialism , christianity 'Islam , the United Nations 'Pompeii , the towers are silent 'The sacred gryphons bury the people 'They come and eat the dead . The husband doesn 't understand his wife . ' 'The woman is enslaved by the kitchen . ' 'A simple logic . You can 't understand each other . ' Stop this nonsense . - Boys ! Put ' Stop this nonsense in the machine . Listen carefully . Two are sitting in a trench with one antitank gun . Three tanks are approaching . The men need to hold them for ten minutes . The tanks appeared suddenly , one could not see them because of the sun . Two men . War . One gun . The sun blinds . A simple logic . Men in the trench die . - You lie . I survived , it happened to me . - It can 't be . The machine buries our boss , time to change the triodes . No , it 's time to think logically . I don 't get it .

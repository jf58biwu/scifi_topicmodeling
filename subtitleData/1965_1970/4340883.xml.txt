 ( Six ) ´ Where am I ? ´ ( Two ) ´ In The Village . ´ ( Six ) ´ What do you want ? ´ ( Two ) ´ Information . ´ ( Six ) ´ Whose side are you on ? ´ ( Two ) ´ That would be telling . ´ We want information ... ´ information ... ´ information . ´ ( Six ) ´ You won ´ t get it . ´ ´ By hook or by crook ... we will . ´ - ´ Who are you ? ´ - ´ The new Number Two . ´ ( Six ) ´ Who is Number One ? ´ ´ You are Number Six . ´ ( Six ) ´ I am not a number , I am a free man ! ´ ( Number Two laughs ) - Training for the big break ? - Why not use the village gymnasium ? Perhaps I prefer privacy . That could be taken as being anti-social . Some setup . Keeping it all to yourself , Number Six ? Not the action of a public-minded citizen . - The committee wouldn ´ t like that . - Certainly not . You ´ ll face the committee for this . ( PA ) ´ The council chamber considered your case , Number 93 , ´ and there ´ s disharmony in your behaviour . ´ You seem reasonable , but you don ´ t want to work for the community . ´ The court has several cases to be dealt with . ´ Number Six needs help , and we want to do something for 42 . ´ She ´ s in a permanent state of depression , always in tears . ´ Your duty , 93 , is to prove you are a suitable member of society . ´ The only way to regain the respect of your fellows ´ is to acknowledge your shortcomings . ´ Go to the rostrum and confess . ´ We will tell you what to say . - ´ They ´ re right , of course . ´ - They ´ re right , of course . - ´ Quite right . ´ - Quite right . - ´ I ´ m inadequate . ´ - I ´ m inadequate . - ´ Disharmonious . ´ - Disharmonious . - ´ I ´ m truly grateful . ´ - I ´ m truly grateful . - ´ Believe me . ´ - Believe me . ´ Believe me ... Believe me . ´ Believe me ! ´ Believe me ... Believe me . ´ BELIEVE ME ! ( Applause ) ´ Number Six , enter . ´ ( Applause ) You have completed the written questionnaire of confession ? Of course ... Naturally . ( PA ) ´ Please do not be hostile . We ´ re here to help . ´ Do sit down . Tell us about yourself . I take it you have checked my file - regarding hostility . ´ Your files are not our concern . ´ Information on you is with Number Two . ´ Really ? The committee deals with complaints . - Complaints ? - ´ Your complaints . ´ I have several . ´ A charge has been made against you about your attitude to your peers . ´ ´ We deplore your disharmony . ´ A common complaint around here . Discretion , Number Six . ´ Everything is being recorded . ´ As evidence against me ! ´ This is an impartial committee . ´ Number Six , you ´ re not here to defend yourself . ´ All we ask is for your confession . ´ I ´ m sure you will cooperate . Gentlemen , it ´ s time . We are ready for a tea break . The Group and medical reports will be considered at the resumed hearing of this committee . ( Man on PA ) ´ They ´ re right , of course . ´ They ´ re right , quite right . ´ Quite ... right . ´ I ´ m inadequate . Inadequate . I ´ m inadequate , disharmonious . ´ ´ I am grateful , truly , truly grateful , truly , truly grateful . ´ ´ Believe me , believe me , believe me ... ´ Beautiful day , Number 61 . I might ´ ve guessed . enjoy the show ? " The slowest mule ´ s nearest to the whip . " " He who digs a pit will one day lie in it . " Is Number Two above investigation ? Nobody is . Non-cooperation makes one an outcast . No more taxis , no more credit . It could be only a beginning . You should know . You don ´ t think I ´ m a member of the committee ? Of course not . Never . No matter what significance you hold for me , to The Village and its committee , you ´ re merely Citizen Number Six , who has to be tolerated and shaped to fit . Public enemy Number Six ? If you insist . But public enemies can ´ t be tolerated indefinitely . Do not defy this committee . If the hearings go against you , I ´ m powerless to help you . Number 86 has had valuable experience with the committee . - As a member ? - I had the shame of being posted . - Disharmonious . - How terrible ( ! ) The hearings were fair . I was wrong . Sir , Number Six has a busy schedule - the Social Group , then the medical . Of course . Do carry on . - No time for tea ? - No . Only your future . First , your frivolous attitude to the committee . The hearings are televised . That is why your behaviour is so important . The Social Group is your one hope . I too have been attached to it . - Most fortunate . - Do try to cooperate . - I will . - Join in the Group ´ s spirit . Naturally . - Only they can help you . - Naturally . Come , we are already overdue . Females ! If she makes one mistake , we could lose Number Six . You hear ? Lose him . There can be no mitigation . We must all stand together . I don ´ t contest the complaint but ... No exceptions . All right . You say you ´ re a poet . You were composing and didn ´ t hear Number 10 ´ s greeting . Neglect of social principle . - Poetry has a social value . - He ´ s trying to divide us . His intentions are to stop us helping this girl . You ´ re trying to undermine my rehabilitation . Disrupt my progress . Strange talk for a poet . - Reactionary ! - Disharmonious ! ( All ) Rebel ! Reactionary ! Rebel ! Disharmonious ! Time for your medical , Number Six . Yes , of course . My medical . Splendid , let ´ s go . First rate , Number Six . Life here suits you . Are you finished ? Just the patella reflexes . Excellent . Fit for any contingency . Anything specific in mind ? My dear chap , how suspicious you are of us all . Be seeing you . ( Doctor ) Next ! Relax , fellow . Relax . - Are you his keeper ? - So excited , rushing and shouting . - You ever been in there ? - Not in there . That ´ s odd . Not odd , please . - Different , maybe . - Different ? I ´ m one of the lucky ones . I was ... Yes ? I was unmutual . The fellow analysis report submitted by the Social Group leaves us no choice . We are bound to classify you as unmutual . We must warn you , if any further complaint is lodged against you , it ´ ll be necessary to give you the treatment - " instant social conversion " . ( PA ) ´ Your attention , please . ´ Here is an important announcement - ´ Number Six has been declared unmutual . ´ Any unsocial incident involving Number Six ´ should be reported to the Appeals Sub-committee . ´ Thank you . ´ Hello ? Hello ! Hello ! We represent the Appeals Sub-committee . Quick off the mark - Number 42 ? Appeals Sub-committee already ? You get around . Do not sneer at Number 42 . Social work requires moral courage . Risk of infection ? Bitterness will not help you , Number Six . You ´ ve brought misfortune on yourself . Nevertheless , ladies , I ´ m sure you will help me . It is premature to look for contrition in the poor creature . Now , let ´ s see how our loner withstands real loneliness . And for his sake , I hope it will not be for long . Did you hear that ? For his own sake . ( Sniggers ) ( PA ) ´ Attention , please . ´ Weather - continuing warm and sunny , ´ with a danger of sudden storms . A reminder . ´ Coffee , please . ´ Incidents about Unmutuals should be reported to the Sub-committee . ´ Thank you for your attention . ´ Unmutualism , Number Six . More than a game . They ´ re socially conscious citizens provoked by an Unmutual . They are sheep . He rejects our help . There remains but one course open to us . ( Phone bleeps ) Yes ? ´ I warned you . The community won ´ t tolerate you . ´ You need a scapegoat - " citizens unite , denounce this menace " . A scapegoat ? Is that what you think it is ? Let me assure you , that after conversion , you won ´ t care what it is . You Just won ´ t care . Ah , yes - social conversion . You ´ ll soon have peace of mind . - Drugs ? - ´ Would drugs be lasting ? ´ What would be lasting is isolation of the aggressive frontal lobes of the brain . ´ Attention , please , all staff psychologists and psychiatrists . ´ Those wishing to study the conversion of Number Six ´ on the hospital ´ s closed-circuit TV , ´ please report immediately to the hospital . Thank you . ´ Splendid , Number Six . Just in time for the procession . ´ We are using standard equipment . ´ A unit of quartz crystal ´ is activated by a variable electromagnetic field from high-voltage condensers - here . The crystal emits ultrasonic sound waves , which are bounced off the parabolic reflector , here . The focal point of the reflector can be seen ... here by use of light waves . ´ I ´ ll demonstrate the molecular turbulence at the focal point . The ultrasonic beam can penetrate , whereas the light cannot . Now ... The prime concern is to locate the link point of the frontal lobes . To do this , we use a low voltage ... and " feel " our focal point into place . We have now located the medial aspect of the left motor area . Three centimetres in ... 1.5 centimetres up ... 0.45 centimetres right ... 0.023 centimetres down ... 0.0015 up ... Hold the horizontal . Precise . The ultrasonic beam is focused on the link point of the frontal lobes . Lanolin to minimise external cell breakdown and scar tissue . Relaxant to preclude muscular reaction . Now , to step up the voltage until the ultrasonic bombardment causes permanent dislocation . You went to sleep , Number Six , at the most interesting point . Just remember , my boy - no exertion , no excitement , that ´ s not for you any more . Don ´ t worry , Doctor . I ´ ll keep an eye on him . And this ? Largely superfluous , but keep it on for a couple of days - to remind you to take it easy . Some of us have to get on ! Go home at your leisure , and by the way - congratulations . Wonderful ! Here he is . Welcome , Number Six . ( Band strikes up ) Welcome , Number Six . Welcome home . The lamb returns to the fold , eh ? That ´ s right , my dear , the kettle - to make Number Six a nice , soothing cup of tea . A celebration drink , eh ? Yes , we ´ ll have our little chat later on . I ´ ll be seeing you both . You ´ re tired . Lie down . Relax . - Cold . - Cold ? Rug ... Bedroom ... Rug . Rug ? RUG ! Wardrobe . Rest well . ( Six ) Be seeing you . Time for our talk , Number Six . Our talk ? Yes , now that all your aggressive anxieties have been expunged , let us say " forever " , I know you ´ ll feel free to speak . Free to ... Particularly about that little incident which has been causing you such absurd distress . ( Mumbles ) The trivia . The trivia of your resignation ! Yes , you resigned . Why ? Why prematurely ? Why did you resign ? It ´ s difficult . Need time to think . - Oh time , that was it was it ? - No , it wasn ´ t time ! You couldn ´ t stand your Job . You needed time to think . I ´ M ASKING YOU , NOT TELLING YOU ! Please don ´ t be angry . I ´ m not angry , my dear friend . That ´ s Just the way things seem to be to you . Because your new world - is so quiet by contrast . - Is it ? For you , agitation is a thing of the past . Lay back and rest , lay back and rest . We ´ ll have our little chat later - when you ´ ve had time to collect your thoughts . Strange , very strange . - What is ? - Already he suspects . The scar is genuine . He ´ ll learn nothing from that . No , but he suspects already . I gave him eight grains of Mytol . Suspicion , doubt - all factors of aggression . The drug should preclude all such reactions . - He ´ s still confused . - He ´ s shocked . He ´ s seen what he thought was the operation . He should be convinced . There ´ s no reason for him to suspect it never really occurred . So he must feel he ´ s undergone the full personality change . - How long before his next dose ? - At least four hours . Repeat the dose now . Now ? ! Sixteen grains of Mytol is quite impossible . Look ! Already aggressions , suspicions . We cannot afford a relapse . Yes , but this drug ... The man ´ s as strong as a bull . We must step up the injections . ( Number Six drumming fingers ) You still have some impatience , impulsiveness . D ´ you like my dress ? More feminine than slacks . There ´ s one thing , though - I can ´ t stand girls who don ´ t know how to make a decent cup of tea . A lesson . Empty pot , rinse out ... Warm the pot , always . Rinse out . Now ... One for me , one for thee , one for the pot ... one for luck . Boiling water , switch off , let stand for one moment . Oh , pour the milk , would you ? Cup , saucer ... spoon ... sugar , please , end cupboard . Pour - should be Just nice . All charmingly domestic . I think I ´ d like some tea . - Here you are . Sugar ? - Thank you . Excellent , my dear . Just leave him . Just leave him to me . # Dum-da-dum ... Drrum ! # Stupid woman ! Number 86 , report to Number Two immediately . Do you hear that ? Immediately . Number 86 report to Number Two immediately . Repeat , immediately ! Stupid woman ! She ´ ll ruin everything ! Be seeing you . Well , why not ? Let him go out . Feel free . He ´ s safely drugged . If he has doubts , suspicions even , a little outside contact will soon reassure him . - Lovely day . - You were an Unmutual . Yes , but I was saved by social conversion . Do you feel different ? ( Laughs ) - You should know . - I should ? - Who better ? See you soon . - See you . Back here again ? But not so full of himself now . Not so much punch in him this time . We have some unfinished business . Yeah - remember , Number Six ? Perhaps he doesn ´ t feel up to it . Too much of a social convert now . - Planning a funeral ? . - I have to report . - On plant life ? - To Number Two . I want to make him happy . Really ? I want to make him happy . The ecstasy of illusion . - I ´ m higher . - Really ? - I ´ m higher than Number Two . - Are you ? I have to report . Go on , then , report . She could ruin the whole thing . Maybe she ´ s watching over Number Six . Physically ? Put out a general call for her . Number Six as well ? . No , he ´ s safe enough here for the time being . Just the girl . ( PA ) ´ Calling Number 86 . Report immediately to Number Two . ´ - I have to report . - Of course . ´ 86 , report to Number Two ! ´ I have to report . First , there ´ s something I have to show you . Very important . Number Two ´ s orders . - See ? - Watch ! Yes , watch . See ? See the little green light ? When I look at that , I always feel sleepy . It makes me want to sleep . See ? I am your superior . Here are my instructions . Listen carefully . This is what I want you to do . I ´ m going to count from four down to one , and then you ´ re going to make a full report on the social conversion of Number Six . Four ... three ... two ... one ! Everything went as planned . We created the illusion of a full ultrasonic dislocation of the frontal lobes of the brain . How was this done ? By using Just sound . No ray , no focal point . The patient lost consciousness ? The result of an intra-dermal injection of Mytol I gave him . I see . How was the illusion maintained ? The patient is being kept heavily tranquillised . Well done , 86 . Thank you , sir . Was there anything further ? Yes - here are your final instructions . Listen carefully . This is what I want you to do . When The Village clock strikes four ... He ´ s safe . - And if the drug wears off ? - It ´ s good for several hours yet . If we search for him , it might revive his suspicions . ( Phone ) Yes ? Right . Out . My dear man , how kind of you to drop in . That little chat we were having ... Why , yes . Clearer in the mind now ? Much clearer and happier . I wanted you to know . - Such peace of mind . - Only to be expected . To think I resisted for so long . Understandable , a man of your training . But now you er ... Everything is clear-cut now . It ´ s quite simple . Quite so . No more problems , eh ? At last we can have our chat . - Yes , I hope so . But ... - But ? I feel I ought to tell everyone . You need only tell me . Just me . Yes , but there must be people who have secrets that you want to know . If I was to speak out publicly , I might ... - Inspire others to speak out also ? - Exactly . What a good idea , Number Six . Highly commendable . I shall record this in my report . I ´ ll be able to thank everyone - the committee , the ladies ´ appeal - for their help - for bringing to me total social conversion ? Now , what could be more natural ? . ´ Your attention , please . Here is an exciting announcement . ´ Following his successful social conversion , ´ Number Six has expressed the touching desire ´ to address you all in person . ´ All of you not otherwise occupied , come now to The Village Square . " ´ Thank you . ´ There is a proverb that he who ploughs a straight furrow needs owe for nothing . Come . And Just remember - no over-excitement , please . Fellow citizens ... ( Cheering ) You ´ re cheering me , you ´ re cheering me - that is a mistake . It is Number Two you should applaud . ( Cheering ) Until he brought about my social conversion , and it was him , not your committee , until then , I was a rebel - an Unmutual , senselessly resisting this , our fine community . To borrow Number Two ´ s saying - " The butcher with the sharpest knife has the warmest heart . " Some of you have resisted , have withheld knowledge from Number Two . Now , thanks to social conversion , I want to tell you all something . I trust that my example will inspire you all to tell ... to tell ... ( Clock strikes four ) Number Two is unmutual ... unmutual ! Social conversion for Number Two ! The Unmutual ! Number 86 has a confession that Number Two is unmutual . Unmutual ! Look at him ! An Unmutual , who desires to deceive you all . Your welfare committee is the tool of those who wish to possess your minds ! ( All ) Unmutual ! Unmutual ! You still have a choice . You can salvage your rights as individuals . Your right to truth and free thought . reject this false world of Number Two . reject it now ! ( All ) Unmutual ! Unmutual !

 [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] REPORTER 1 : All we 're asking from you is one little stat . Why all the silence , doctor ? REPORTER 2 : Is this true that you 've been investigating UFOs for the last three months ? REPORTER 3 : Sir , do you really believe in these saucers ? REPORTER 1 : Come on , professor ? Are there people from outer space ? LLOYD : The doctor is not answering any more questions . REPORTER 1 : Oh , just one little statement , sir . Evidence that there are people and invaders from other planets ? Look , that is enough . The doctor is sick . He is exhausted . REPORTER 1 : Yeah , we know , he 's exhausted . LLOYD : If you want any more information you will have to wait until the conference in New York . Come on . Just go please , now . Come on , get off the plane . You know you shouldn 't be on here in the first place . [ THUNDER CRACKS ] LLOYD : Dad ? - I 've changed my mind . - We 're not going . - Oh , we 're not going ? There 's a man out there . I saw his hand . He 's one of them . - What do you mean , one of them ? - One of the aliens . Oh , dear Dad , you simply must cut this out . Don 't you understand ? This plane could be a death trap for me . [ THUNDER CRACKS ] NARRATOR : The Invaders . A Quinn Martin Production . Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . NARRATOR : The invaders . Alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination : the Earth . Their purpose : to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road , looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner . And a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here , that they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Roddy McDowall . Laurence Naismith . Harold Gould . Tonight 's episode : NARRATOR : Plot or paranoia ? There was no doubt in David Vincent 's mind . A celebrated astrophysicist , Dr. Curtis Lindstrom , had discovered the truth , that alien beings were here on Earth . In less than a week , at a meeting of his colleagues , Dr. Lindstrom would announce it to the world . Then , perhaps , David Vincent could put down his burden . It all seemed so simple . Will you see that these bags get to the Covington Hotel . MINISTER : Mr. Vincent ? Hello . Hello , hello . I 'm afraid that Dr. Lindstrom isn 't feeling too well . So he asked me if I 'd meet you and bring you out to the house . - That 's very kind of you . - It 's no trouble . Least I can do for an old friend . Should I have Hank take your bags ? - They 've been taken cared of , thanks . - Good , good , good . Dr. Lindstrom 's home , please . LINDSTROM : The whole world is blind . Sick . Complacently marching to its own annihilation . Curtis , if you 'll just allow us to help you- - I am no lunatic , Paul . And I don 't intend to be locked away in a hospital , either by your or by my son . PAUL : Look , Curtis , please try to understand . All I 'm suggesting- - I know , a few days rest , some tranquilizers , - and peace and solitude . PAUL : But at least at the hospital- - I am not sick , Paul , and I don 't need a psychiatrist . How can I convince you ? Look , supposing I were to tell you within the very near future that the Americans or the Russians would land on another planet . Would you of necessity think I was mad ? Well , the invaders are real , Paul . They are here amongst us . And they intend to wipe us out like bugs . Curtis , by your own admission , you are exhausted . - You are overworked . - I am not sick , Paul . How long do you think you can go on this way ? Don 't you think I know how this sounds ? But I can prove every word I say . And they know it . That 's why they 've got to try it again . That 's why they 've got to try to kill me . And this time they can 't afford to miss . I 'm scared , Paul . I 'm scared . Curtis , let me take you to the hospital . You 'll be safe there . I 'll keep personal watch over you . Trust me , Curtis . Please , Dad . All right , I 'll go . But understand this : I intend to go to that meeting on Tuesday . And I will not be silenced . MINISTER : Something wrong , Mr. Vincent ? Relax , Mr. Vincent . It 's just a few more miles . Dr. Lindstrom said he lived 10 minutes from town . We 've been driving for 25 . Traffic 's a little heavier than usual today , I 'm afraid . DAVID : What traffic ? There 's no traffic . - You haven 't been noticing . If you 'll forgive me for saying so , you apparently notice very little . A pity . Pull over . I said pull over . Don 't extend yourself , Mr. Vincent . We 're almost there . You 'd better hope that he doesn 't make it to the hospital in time . All prepared , doctor . Shall I bring Professor Lindstrom down now ? What do you want ? Doctor , I 'm David Vincent . I talked to you on the telephone yesterday . How do I know who you are ? How did you find me ? Well , your housekeeper told me . Look , doctor , I know what you 're going through . I 've been there myself . So they 're going to try to kill you , right here , now , today . I know they tried it with me just a few minutes ago . - You ? Why you ? - Well , my arrival forced their hand , sir . They 're afraid . They 're afraid you 're gonna share your knowledge with me . Now , you 've got to get out of here , right now . Here we go , professor . Doctor 's orders . Just a warm bath . Most patients in- - - What are you doing here ? - I have permission . - You do , huh ? - Yes . Well , check it if you like . All right , mister . That 's just what I 'm gonna do . You say they tried to kill you , Mr. Vincent ? Who ? What do they look like ? I have a better question . How did they know I was coming to see you ? I don 't know . I don 't know anything anymore except that I 'm supposed to be safe here . Doctor , you 're not safe here . You are not safe anywhere as long as someone knows where you are . Doctor , you 've got to go into hiding until the conference . Somewhere no one can find you . You ? What do you want ? Please , doctor , I 'll go with you if you want me to . - But I can not- - - Will you leave him alone ? This is my patient . I will not have him upset . DAVID : His life is in danger every second he 's here . PAUL : Must I have you forcibly removed ? DAVID : This is a matter of life or death . - Get out of here . - Get him out of here . - All right , I 'll leave . But Dr. Lindstrom , please do what I asked you to do . Before it 's too late . I know them better than you . - If you need me , I 'll be at the hotel . NURSE : Come on , mister . The Hotel Covington . Are you all right ? I wonder if he 's speaking the truth . It must be hell for him if he is . He says I should leave here . Oh , no . No , no , you 're safe here . Anyway , what about the treatment that Dr. Mailer 's arranged for you ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I don 't know . [ LAUGHS ] You really expect me to believe any of this ? I expect you to call Dr. Lindstrom , lieutenant . If he confirms my story , I expect you to give him protection . Well , for heaven 's sakes , at least call . Have a drink . You know , it 's been a pretty rough day , Vincent . So ... I just hope that this doesn 't turn out to be- - Yes , I 'd like to speak to Dr. Lindstrom , please . I just hope this doesn 't turn out to be some kind of a gag because you 're gonna- - Yes . Oh , really . No . Thank you . You just got shot down in flames , mister . His son checked him out of that hospital one hour ago and he was alive and healthy . Got any other problems , Mr. Vincent ? I 'm going into town . Can I bring you anything ? - No , thanks . - It 's no trouble . - I like to make my guests comfortable . - I said , no thank you . - Well , good night . - Good night . WOMAN 1 : Operator . - Hello , operator ? - Yes , sir . - I want to speak - to the hotel at Covington . - One moment please . - Hurry , please . - Yes , sir . WOMAN 2 : Evening , Covington Hotel . - I want to speak to Mr. David Vincent . - David Vincent ? - Yes , that 's right , Vincent . David Vincent . I 'll ring . Hello operator ? Operator . Operator . WOMAN 2 : I 'm sorry , sir , there 's no answer . Do you with to leave a message ? LINDSTROM : Yes , yes . Tell him Dr. Lindstrom called . Tell him I have proof . Documentary evidence . Tell him it 's at my- - Hello ? - Hello , sir ? Are you there ? Hello ? - Good evening , sir . - If you want Mrs. Davis- - - We 're government agents , sir , - asked to bring you to Washington . - Hello ? Something about a conference on Tuesday . Hello , sir . Are you there ? - Hello ? - And you found me ? - How ? - Well , your son told us . He 's quite worried about you , doctor . He seemed relieved that we were taking over . Thank God . Thank God . MAN 1 : Shall we go , doctor ? We have a long drive . By the way , doctor , you do have the proof in that suitcase ? How did you know about the proof ? I told no one . [ CAMERA CLICKS ] [ CAMERA CLICKS ] COP : Now , just a minute , doctor . - Not now , please . Well if you 'll just confirm what his son has told us- - Dr. Lindstrom was mentally ill . He 's paranoidal , if you wish . In his state of mind , he- - He was a very sick man , sergeant . Excuse me . DAVID : He was murdered , Mr. Lindstrom . I 'm sorry . Perhaps if I had been with him ... or if I had gained his confidence sooner- - Did you hear me when I said your father was- - I heard . Mr. Vincent , I think that you are disturbed . I think you are even more disturbed than my father was . Are you so sure your father was disturbed ? There are no doubts , no fears ? A plane blew up . His own automobile went over a cliff three days later . And you 're so certain- - I cannot understand your concern over the death of a man you hardly even knew . Now , my father could not have been murdered . I was the only one who knew where he was . The only one . And I certainly didn 't tell any- - Oh , my God . Oh , no . Oh , my God , no . Mr. Lindstrom , who did you tell ? No . They were- - They were government agents . They showed me their credentials . They- - [ SIGHS ] What do you want ? Your father called me just before the accident . He left a message at my hotel saying he had proof . Documentary evidence that they are invaders from another planet here on Earth . I 've got to have that proof . It must be found before they could destroy it . You think I know where he did it ? Did it ever occur to you that the men- - No , no , they didn 't get it . Because I know that . When I went back to my hotel after the accident , my room had been ransacked , turned upside down . Now , Lloyd , I need your help . I 've got to have that proof . Please , trust me . Help me to find it . LLOYD : All right . Of course , but I- - I simply can 't do anything until tomorrow morning . I must be alone with my father now . Certainly . [ GRUNTING ] You did very well . I want you to stay close to him . Oh , my head . These- - These headaches . Ever since Maryland- - It will all be over soon , my son . [ GRUNTING ] LINDSTROM [ ON TAPE ] : I don 't care what you believe , Paul . It 's true . They 're here . They 're going to take over the Earth . How long I can go on evading them , I don 't know . But , God willing , I 'll stop them . I 'll stop them , Paul . I 've got to stop them . PAUL : Are you satisfied , Mr. Vincent ? Are you sure Lindstrom didn 't say anything about proof or where he hid it ? PAUL : This tape represents the only interview we had at the hospital . It was all we had time for . Face it , Mr. Vincent , if your failure to find anything here or at the hospital hasn 't convinced you there is no proof- - I 'm sorry , doctor , I haven 't been convinced . Where are you going ? I 'm going to search the inn where your father spent his last hours . Wait a minute . I 'll go with you . I think it would save time if you check his office at the university . I 'll call you later . PAUL : Lloyd , have you lost your reason , too ? Why are you cooperating with that man ? Lloyd ? Lloyd ? What is it ? Doctor , may I please have the pills ? What 's wrong Lloyd , what are these for ? It 's just like I get these violent headaches . - Please , may I have them ? - When did you start suffering - headaches this violent ? - Please . Who gave you these ? There 's no prescription- - Give me those pills . Oh , Paul , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to be rude . It 's just that- - Well , with the strain of Dad 's death , I had- - I 've just been getting these headaches , but I 'm all right . Now , Lloyd , you still haven 't told me who prescribed those pills . There 's a doctor in the apartment building where I live in New York . You know , just before I came out to join Dad . But look , now don 't worry . I 'm fine . I 'm just going out and get a breath of air . [ SIGHS ] I told you he didn 't leave anything behind . Oh , could he have left a package or a briefcase with the handyman , gardener ? No , I run the place myself . All alone . Say , wait a minute . He could have mailed it . Here 's a post office receipt made out to him showing that a registered package was delivered to- - Well , to whom ? Where was it delivered ? It 's a New York address . Look , miss , I 've got to have that stub . It 's important to me . Well , so is my licence . It 's against the law - to tamper with the mail . - Oh , it 's all right . You see , the man to whom this belongs is dead . You can 't get in trouble . - I don 't know . If- - - If it 'll make you feel better you can call his son , Lloyd Lindstrom . He stayed with his father in Covington . He 'll vouch for me . I never could resist a good-looking man . Thank you . Say , are you sure you can 't stay for lunch ? No , thank you . I 'd like the number of a Lloyd Lindstrom in Covington . [ PHONE RINGING ] Yes ? Yes , yes , this is he . Oh . Oh , thank you . Thank you very much . Oh , no , don 't worry about it , madam . Thank you for telling me . Goodbye . Well , I was sure sorry to read about Dr. Lindstrom . He was always so kind . So nice when he stayed here at his son 's apartment . I was really looking forward to saying hello to him when he came to attend that big conference . Know what I mean ? I put the package on the bureau when it was delivered . It 's over there . You know , I really shouldn 't be doing this . But you got an honest face . Excuse me . [ PHONE RINGING ] Hello ? Yeah . It 's for you . Mr. Lindstrom . - Lloyd ? - Where have you been ? I 've been trying to reach you . I thought I had missed you . How did you know where to find me ? Well , that lady at the Pine Cone Inn . She called me after you left . Hey , did you find anything ? Is there any proof ? Oh , boy , have I found- - Would you mind ? Okay , don 't take too long . Lloyd , I 've got enough here to blow the lid right off . Thanks to your father 's hard work . Well , look , I 'm coming right in . I want to be there when you turn it over to the conference . I 'm not going to the conference , Lloyd . I 'm going to Washington . I 'm leaving tonight on the midnight train . Washington ? Why Washington ? Well , I have an old army buddy . He 's with the CIA . His name is Jack Bryant . I 'm gonna call him before I leave . I 'm gonna make an appointment for the first thing in the morning . I know it 's Sunday , but I 'll meet him at his apartment . By noon tomorrow , every capitol in the world is gonna know . Lloyd , I wanna thank you for all the help you 've given me . I 'll get in contact with you when I get back . So long . [ DIALLING PHONE ] I just spoke to Vincent . He found the material in my New York apartment . He 's taking it to Washington , to Jack Bryant of the CIA . No , no , he 's going to meet him in his apartment . That 's right . His apartment . I 'm glad you 're pleased , sir . [ DOOR OPENS ] What are you doing here ? How did you break in ? I had this pill analyzed . It 's like nothing the chemist has ever seen . I want an explanation . Lloyd . Lloyd . Listen , I 've known you all your life . You can trust me . Look , you 've got to tell me what this is all about . That phone call , the pills , the headaches . What 's behind it ? Lloyd . Whatever it is , I 'll stand by you . Believe me , I 'II- - You 're going to give me an explanation , Lloyd . You can stand there until doomsday but- - Will you answer me ? My father was an enemy . What happened to him was necessary . It was all necessary . Hello , operator ? I want New York City , Endicott 29971 . Quickly please , operator . A man 's life may depend on it . [ PHONE RINGING ] [ GRUNTING ] [ CAR HORN BEEPS ] [ DOORBELL BUZZES ] - Good morning . - Good morning . - David Vincent to see Mr. Bryant . - Mr. Bryant 's expecting you . If you 'll come this way . Mr. Bryant , here is Mr. Vincent . Hi , Jack . I would have been here sooner , buddy , but the traffic in this town is- - Jack ? LLOYD : Please forgive us , David . Your friend , Mr. Bryant , lives across the hall . We changed the directory . It 's good to see you again , my son . You 'll take him to Maryland ? That 's right . To Maryland . Last meal ? [ SIGHS ] Lloyd , I understand betraying me . But why your father ? Why ? My father was an enemy . What happened to him was necessary . It was all necessary . What are you afraid of ? They 're not going to execute you . They 're just going to change your brain patterns . Impose their will on yours . That 's all . How ? - How did they do that ? - I was the first , and you 'll be the second . - And after that- - - Why don 't they just kill me ? Oh , well , now . You see , you said that your friend in the CIA was expecting you . You said you had positive proof . Now you will attend the conference and say there never was any proof . It was all just an old man 's nightmare . Or otherwise- - I 'm sorry you didn 't have a chance to finish your meal , but it 's time . Oh , God . [ LLOYD GRUNTING ] [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] [ CLICKING ] [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] You are a very foolish man , Mr. Vincent . Can 't you understand that there is no escape ? [ GROANS ] [ GROANS ] LLOYD : Evening , Dave . You know , you 've been sleeping all day . What ? It 's not gonna do any good to fight it . If they don 't break you the next time , you know , you 'll- - All right , so I 'll die . Now , what is that going to prove ? Get out of here . Just go tell your friends they 're wasting their time . You 're a bigger fool than he was . Who ? Your father ? May I remind you- - Remind you that my father was an enemy . What happened to him was necessary . It was- - My father was- - Oh , no . Is that what happens when you begin remembering , Lloyd ? Is it ? Is that what happens ? [ LLOYD GRUNTING ] Whose voice do you remember Lloyd ? Whose voice do your hear , your father 's ? Tell me Lloyd . Shut up . No , no , no . Please . - This is how they hold you , Lloyd . - Please , give me- - This kills the pain . This keeps away the memories . - Give me , give me those . - No , Lloyd , I 'm sorry . Give me those pills ! [ LLOYD SCREAMING ] Mr. Vincent ? Shall we go ? Peacefully this time ? [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] [ EXPLOSION ] [ EXPLOSION ] [ LLOYD SCREAMING ] [ MAN SCREAMING ] Ah ! Ah ! Lloyd , come on , let 's get out of here . Lloyd . Come on , let 's go . - My , my- - - Get up . My father was an enemy . What happened to him was necessary . It was all necessary . You weren 't responsible for what happened to your father . They- - They were wrong . Wrong . You must stop them David . You must ... [ POLICE SIRENS WAILING ] NARRATOR : For David Vincent , another beachhead destroyed .

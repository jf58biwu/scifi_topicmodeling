 Why are you here today fighting The Peace Game ? I see it as an opportunity to put my country on the international map . Because I was chosen . - This Game doesn 't concern me . - Why ? There 's been too much death and destruction already . A lot of people are watching the Game . You do a good job here , you got a good record , they take care of you when you get home . I don 't know . The man says go and ... I go . I 'm here to defend the democracy of my country and that is worth to fight for . - Do you still live with your family ? - Yes . What do they think about you fighting The Peace Game ? My mother 's a little bit nervous and afraid for me but she thinks it is necessary to go because I am drafted . Are you afraid ? Not afraid . Nervous . A little bit . Do you think The Peace Game is necessary ? - Yes . - Why ? Well ... I don 't know . I don 't know nothing about it . Everything 's getting very slack . Nobody cares anymore . For example , out the last 24 games , we haven 't won a single one . It may be of interest to you to know that , not long ago , the peoples of the United Nations and the leading communist countries , determined to maintain international peace and internal security , to save succeeding generations from the scourge of yet another world war and to re-affirm faith in the dignity and worth of the human being , resolved the following ... Good morning . To organise international machinery from all races and creeds and political beliefs for the playing of a series of military games in special centres to be established in the non-aligned countries , by which purpose it is hoped to divert the natural aggressions of mankind towards the true fundamentals of honorable sportsmanship and the spirit of the team . These military contests , based incidentally on the gladiatorial games of ancient Rome , are known as The International Peace Games . I hope that , by my participation in this game , I shall be able to give the people of Britain something concrete to strive for . It 's good for people in the country to see it and it does them good ... if it 's done well . They 've been playing it all wrong . They don 't move fast enough . You 've got to move fast and hit them hard . You could do that and still get your ass out in one piece . I don 't know . Look what we built up after the war . We , the Germans . I mean ... And we will not lose that . And that 's why I 'm here . Yeh . I 'm 21 . - Where are you from in West Germany ? - I 'm from Krefeld . 24 . Where are you from ? England . 23 . - Where are you from in West Germany ? - Frankfurt . I 'm from Da Nang , in the middle of Vietnam . Detroit , Michigan . How old are you ? 25 . 21 . 24 . Today 's Peace Game , number 256 in the current series , is to be played under the auspices of the Swedish army in a castle near Stockholm . Gentlemen , may I have your teams ? Are the teams present and correct ? Yes , they are . You are French ? Yes . And you 're a student ? Yes . Then why are you here today in The Peace Game ? I am here to destroy the System , so that this Game no longer exists . - THE GLADIATORS - Producer Screenplay Director of Photography Did you check the red circuit ? Yes . Music Executive Producer Editor - Director Davidsson here . We have a problem with DISTORTED VALUES again . Tell them ... to send up coffee at eleven . - It 's our producer . - Producer ? Yes . Bolognini Spaghetti buys two hours for us on the global network every Saturday . Colonel , Colonel ... We 're got a live show to get on the air . I love the excitement of a live show . My audience loves the excitement of a live show . But we have only seven minutes to get on the air or the sponsor will kill us . Sponsor ? We still have a flicker on RECIPROCAL INSTABILITY . And I believe ... there 's still a malfunction on SLOW MOTION MURDER . In the West the programme has become the most popular thing on TV . According to the latest ratings it has a weekly audience of 83 % . And in your own country , colonel ? In Sweden ? We don 't show the programme here . What do you think of the soldiers over there ? They don 't interest me at all . They all talk of patriotism , of honour , democracy , the fight against Communism ... and don 't understand that all these ideas are given them by the System so it can use them better . They 're completely unaware of the tragedy of the world in which we live . In 10 minutes they 'll still be there convincing themselves of grand reasons for fighting but the Game will no longer exist . I 'm going to destroy that fucking Machine . We 'll have trouble with that one . - Who is that idiot ? - We can check . What 's his number ? B-3 Green . One of our splendid so-called " Allies " . And you don 't think that the Machine ... the System ... the Game ... is using you at all ? Not at the moment . But I know that , when I finish University and go back to everyday society , the System will try to absorb me . That 's why I 'm here now . I refuse to let that happen . I 'm determined to destroy the System before it uses me ... and everyone else . Tell me , General , what goal is used by your team ? Goal ? I think we tell them all paths lead to the Control Room . Something like that . Surely they can 't do anything , even if they get there . Well , you know how it is . It gives them something to aim for . We 'll use Program No. 17 today . Thank you . This is for your refreshment , Colonel . It 's china tea , of course . 700 million Chinese armed with Mao 's thoughts are 700 million atom bombs . Excellent . Excellent . Gentlemen , I think I need not say what an honour and pleasure it is for me to be amongst you today . I agree . I 'm sure we 'll be able to enjoy ourselves . Like chess players . No matter what the outcome . Do you believe in violence ? If I want to destroy the System , I have to be violent . But those who are already there , who are violent against us , the bourgeois call " law and order " . They don 't call them violent . I have the right to say what I think and to study at the university . I 'm forced to be violent to achieve things . The System forces me . Tell me , General , what are people like that doing on your team ? Why ? Well , don 't you think they might be a slight cause of disruption ? Nonsense . Youthful exuberance , that 's all . We use the Game to channel off these instincts . You 'll see . They soon learn to look at things in proper perspective . Remarkable . - How much are you giving him ? - 750 volts . - Usually rising to 1,000 . - Serves him right , loud-mouthed jerk . Maybe . He shows endurance , though . Bastards ! Shit ! Goddammit ! God , my stomach 's lousy today . Fuckers ! Shit ! Goddammit ! Fuckers ! Don 't you have trouble with people like that ? In Sweden ? No , no . Very seldom . Occasional but ... very seldom . How do you deal with them when you do ? Here ? We just talk to them . They soon understand . And what if they don 't understand ? Well , in that case , we have somewhere special that we put them . Damn ! Members on the Allied Team ... stand in readiness for the first move of the Game . Where the hell are they ? Shit . We 're sitting ducks out here . What are we gonna do , man ? Good morning , members of the Allied Team . Before you ... you will see a set of green lights . These lead directly and safely to the Control Room but take a path three times longer than that offered by the red lights , which offer a shorter but also more dangerous route to the Control Room . If , at any time , you wish to leave the Game , simply follow the yellow lights which lead directly to the nearest exit . You have two hours in which to reach the Control Room and , of course , the opposite team will try to prevent you by any means at their disposal . You will be awarded points for strength and lose points for weakness . - Quiet ! - Now , B-1 , can you hear me ? You are the leader and we expect a very high standard from you . If I may use a boxing metaphor , you can win on points but what we want is a knock-out . On behalf of the International Peace Games Commission , we wish you a safe and rewarding journey . Come on , man ! Will you be quiet ? Beg pardon ? LS it ? - You didn 't tell me . - No , Sir . What 's happened so far , then ? Well , I 'm sure we can start the Game off with a bang . - Their turn to go first , Sir . - Oh , yes . Colonel , your turn first , I believe . No , please , General . After you , I insist . No , Sir . Where I come from , we always let the away team kick off first . Very well . Plan 10B , overall attack on enemy ! Long live Chairman Mao 's thoughts ! I would like to address my team too . Good morning . Good evening , Ladies and Gentlemen , and you 're watching the International Peace Game , a two-hour quality show brought to you by the Bolognini Pasta Corporation , the makers of spaghetti , tubettini , fetuccini and macaroni . Come on , man ! Come on ! Cover that bloody flank down there ! Cover that bloody flank ! Just in case you 're wondering , there is , of course , no-one at the other end of the telephone . Do you read me ? - How much is this stuff ? - Four-and-nine a packet , Sir . Damned expensive it is , too . This whole damned operation ... I 'm boxed in ! I 'm boxed in under mortar fire ! Sapphire One , this is Gilded Cage . I must have immediate artillery ... Cover that flank ! Cover that flank ! Our show tonight , as always , has intrigue , suspense and violence . Where are you ? What the hell 's happening down there ? Cover that flank ! What is it ? Can you see them ? Get cover ! Get that machine gun ! The sound you 're now listening to , that of the pressure of the system , is normally broadcast at approximately 18,500 cycles , beyond human audibility but within the consciousness of the brain . For this Game , we 've lowered the sound to 1,015 cycles so that you may hear it . Move the bloody flank ! I 'm 21 . The government 's hard put to afford it . But , General , look what you are paying for : the expertise of years of Swedish peacekeeping . Plus the very high standard of our workmanship . The real purpose of International Peace Games , of course , is nothing whatsoever to do with world peace . The real reason , you will discover at the end of the Game . Jesus Christ . The snow 's melting . Hey , the snow 's melting . What ? The fucking snow is melting ! The local inhabitants have a service of 12 trains a day to Stockholm . None of them , of course , stop here . Don 't worry about that . Move out . Move out ? Where are we going ? The red lights , you bloody fool . That 's where we 're going . Move ! Are you kidding ? They could still be out there . They 've stopped firing . That 's good enough for me . Red light by the ladder up there . Come on . Keep moving forward slowly . Booby trap . Heads down . It may be of interest to know that , of the eight young people in this room , four will shortly die and the remainder will continue to play the Game as hard as they can . Tell me , Colonel , what do you charge for the use of your Machine ? We normally charge in units of one minute , at a flat rate of 10,000 SEK per unit , with an extra charge , of course , if the Machine is used after 4pm . Good morning . Come on , now . We must find these bloody red lights . To hell with the red lights . Why not the green ones ? The red lights are the quickest way to the Control Room . And that 's where we 're going . And fast . Do you think he can go on now ? That isn 't your business . You watch down there . You shut your fucking mouth . Please give me the face of the young man on the left . No need to worry about that one . Perfectly reliable . Know the type backwards . Will you now please ask the Machine to comment on his social attitude ? - He 's all right , isn 't he ? - Oh , yes , Sir . Absolutely . I happen to know what school he went to . - Where was that ? - Kingston Grammar , Sir . Here they are . B-2 , cover the rear . B-8 , set your weapon here . Quick . How do we know what 's down there ? The red lights are down there and that 's all that counts . He can 't go down there like that . He comes ! I 'm not leaving the team behind like dead flies . He 'll be OK if we don 't mollycoddle him . Now let 's move it ! Come on . Move your ass . - Quit bugging him . - Alright ! Do we leave him or take him with us ? If we hang around , we 're gonna get killed . Who do you think you are ? The General ? Don 't give me any shit , boy . Boy ? How would you like to write home and tell your mom a boy kicked your ass ? For Christ 's sake ! Stop your petty squabbling ! You are a real troublemaker , boy . I ain 't telling you no more . What the fuck are you laughing at , slant-eye ? Go to hell , crazy man . Watch what you say , punk ! They call you our Allies . You button up , turd ! You burn our villages and kill children and women . You shut your mouth or I 'll ... You put your scuzzy hands on me again , turd , and I 'll tie you in a knot and you 'll catch a round between the fucking eyeballs ! The Yanks are letting the side down , aren 't they ? No pride in their country , Sir . Listen to me , all of you . We can 't go on like this here . This isn 't a discussion camp meeting . The endeavours of the Western Team to play the Game will lead them , of course , nowhere . Fighting ! Fighting ! Don 't laugh when I talk to you . Right . B-8 , down that chute . - Why me ? - That 's an order . B-4 , help him . B-2 , look after him . The rest , over here . Engineer Rundelius ? Would you please be so very kind and turn on the steam for the jungle ? It has been estimated that , during the Spartan Wars of 2,000 years ago , the cost of killing one man was approximately $ 50 . By the time of the 2nd World War , this cost had risen to $ 65,000 per man . Today , with the high killing ratio per $ invested of the nuclear system , it costs no more to kill one man than it did 2,000 years ago . It 's simple ... but moving . Get him up ! Get him up ! Fucking shit ! Hold my rifle . Between the years 1960 and 1970 , the world spent on the arms system over 64 thousand billion pounds or approximately 23 million pounds ... each second . Burial Officer , please . Ekström ? Davidsson here . We have a " Killed In Action " for you in 23 minutes . Yes , we have his footprints . What 's that ? For Christ 's sake , it 's only a leech . This , gentlemen , is another example of the advantages of using our Machine , the unique opportunity to try out new and exotic weapon systems , without the expense and inconvenience of a real war . Come on , let 's move . We can 't stay here all bunched up like this . I told you before : one of us has got to take him out of this Game . For the last bloody time , B-8 ... I want to get out of this fucking bunker as much as you but he can 't move . Look at him . He can 't fucking move ! - What did you say ? - Do something about him . Get him to an exit . When I want your opinion , B-6 , I 'll ask for it . This has gone on long enough . Get him up on his feet and out ! Leave him fucking be . Get him out of here . Get him out fast or I ain 't fucking moving . You haul your ass up or I 'll kick it ! Listen , guy . I give you exactly 5 seconds . Shut your nigger mouth and go back into position . What you fucking say , fuckface ? Now , come on , B-8 . Be reasonable ! Be fucking what ? Major Doubting , who is that man ? Is he one of ours ? Yes , Sir , he is . - Being a nuisance . - I 'll take care of it , Sir . Soldier . You there . Huh ? Son , I know the hatred that 's burning in you . But , son , use that hate in a constructive way . Sir ? Hate . Hate is a driving force . Let it drive you up , not down . UP . Sir ? Up . Up to the Control Room . That 's what you were brought here for . To be the first of your people to get there . You brought me here so I could go back home and take a back seat on the bus . But , son ... I 'm not your fucking son . ICARUS seems to be pushing him towards a climax . I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again . This Machine needs reprogramming . It 's far too ... unsubtle . Alright . Come on , kid . Give me the fucking palm of your hand . Give him his weapon , will you ? You , give me a hand . Thank you . Come on . For Christ 's sakes , come the fuck on . I don 't know what gives him such nerve . We could send them all back to Africa . Who is to blame him ? He 's got nothing to fight for . Our boys are all right . Damned coloured chaps who cause all the trouble . I suggest , Sir , we try COMMON DANGER . Grip ' em , Captain Davidsson . Grip ' em . Do you mean to say that the Machine knows that man 's going to die 23 minutes before he does ? Remarkable . Get down ! Get down ! Give me some fucking cover ! For Christ 's sake , get some covering fire ! Give me your gun ! Come on , now ! Move up ! You know , the Bundeswehr is good for me . It 's security . There 's always a job . And my wife is expecting a baby . Bloody thing ! Fire over the top of there ! Come on ! Let 's move it out of here ! Move out ! Move out ! Come on ! Cover me . Come on . Move . We 've been here already . - What 's that ? - We 've been here before ! They 're up there . I can hear somebody moving . B-6 , grenade . Up the stairs ! Quick ! OK . Move it ! Where 's your rifle ? - It 's down there . - Take this one . - There 's one up here . - Give him a bullet ! Kill the gook ! Kill the bastard ! Christ ! Go there . I see we have a prisoner . Three points for a prisoner , Sir . Careless of you , Colonel . B-2 , check upstairs . B-10 , over here . Go on upstairs , B-2 . Leave her , leave her . Upstairs . Upstairs . Go on . Check upstairs . It may be of interest to note that each of the members of the Western Team prepared for this Peace Game by an average of approximately 5 years of infancy , 13 years of schooling , 4 years of university , during all of which time , of course , not one of them has ever actually seen or spoken to someone from the mainland of Communist China . Until this moment . Bullshit ! She 's fucking lying ! Give me two minutes with her and we 'll get the whole story . Alright , alright ... That 's what she needs ! Fucking bitch ! Alright , B-4 . Leave her . That 'll do . Look after him . Go on . - Search her . - Search her ? Yes . Search her . References , maps , anything else you can find . Ask her her rank and serial number and where her comrades are . - Where are your comrades ? - I don 't know . Keep your hands up ! - Crazy , man . - Alright . Alright . Lie still . Just lie still . Give me that First Aid . Hello ? Sunflower One ? What 's the matter with this thing ? I don 't know . I tried . Come on . Give me his First Aid . It must be the water . Ask her where her comrades are . - Where are your comrades ? - I don 't know . Hands up . We 're losing valuable points and time . Hands up . Have you found anything ? Well , look ! It might be stuffed up her crotch ! Hello , Sunflower . We have one dead , B-9 . One wounded , B-8 . Severe shoulder wounds . OK . Put him down . OK . Keep your hands up . Where are your comrades ? Alright . Sit Still . Come on . Step on it . What the fuck do you think we 're doing ? Request immediate hospitalization instructions . Hello ? What 'll we do with her ? Right . We take her with us . B-10 . Secure her . Tie her up . Shove something in her mouth . I 'm not having her screaming her head off during the rest of the Game . Well , come on . Hurry it up . Hurry it up . Come on , B-10 . Finish it up . We take her with us ? We take her with us or we shoot her . - Come here with that groundsheet . - What for ? He 's not going to get better on the floor . Move it with that groundsheet ! B-7 , get your rifle . B-2 , take the prisoner and send her up first . Move it ! Move it ! Come along . There 's someone over there . - Where ? - There ! Hello . What do we have here then ? This is where we put our B-3 's and try to make it nice and comfortable for them . A scribble-board where they can write their slogans . A wide range of drinks . A swimming pool . A sun patio . Flower ... white ... peace ... Not war ... love ... not hate ... How much does it cost ? Let me see now ... It takes up about 40 % of our defence budget . That means 40 % of £ 300 million . - That 's about ... - 40 % of how much ? £ 300 million . No , actually , to be precise , £ 302 million . That 's a great deal of money for a neutral country to spend on defence . Yes . But how good if they could utilise this enormous amount of money not for the machine of destruction but to help the poorer countries . What for ? Right . This has gone on long enough . I don 't know what 's happening here but we 're not staying to find out . He stays . The rest of you , move out . No . - I 'm staying here . - Now look here , B-6 . I 'm staying here . Relax , boys ... Relax . Look , I know how you feel . But time is against us now . We must leave him . He 'll slow us down too much . But I promise you I 'll have him taken care of . We have the opportunity , by playing this Game to the full , to show that friendship , loyalty , courage , pride in one 's country , pride in one 's self are the things that still really count . I think he 's dead . Better out of harm 's way . Don 't you think so ? Let all be happy . Let no-one suffer from want . Let everyone see good around him . And let none be miserable . How many points for that , gentlemen ? 27 . 60 . 25 . 141 . Points , Sir ? T. 7 ... Any more ? There 's no point in going on . We 're all stuck . There 's nothing we can do about it . Whatever we do ... Calm down ! That Machine is going to destroy us if we don 't destroy it ! For God 's sake , pull yourself together ! No entry . Government property . What 's that ? No , no . Government property ... You ... you ... Government property ! It 's the Control Room . No , no ... No Control Room . It never has been ... Damn ! The name of this young man is Svensson . He 's a member of the Swedish Police Force . It 's his function to guard the System and salute the trains which pass the factory . - You can 't go in there . - Let me pass . I 've no time to lose ! Don 't you understand ? Let me through ! Do I have to use this ? Don 't mess with that ! Might I enquire ? What is he after ? Who ? Oh , him ... Same as the others , I shouldn 't wonder . To get to the Control Room and all that . What does he expect to do when he gets there ? I expect he 's got some idea of overthrowing something or other . ICARUS will soon correct that . Good morning . May I present myself ? Ahlberg , Assistant to the Controller . Swedish . Come on . Sit down . Sit down . Nice to meet you . What 's this place ? Oh , of course ... Use this . The Machine will translate and then I can speak Swedish . What do you want ? Or rather , what do you want ? You know perfectly well . First , to destroy this whole mess . Will they appreciate it , do you think ? They 'll understand perfectly . That 's why I don 't want any delay . There 's no need to explain . They don 't understand why ... They don 't think ... That 's why the present System is one of such discrimination . Your System ... What will that be like ? My System ? I 'm going to establish a new idea of work and workers . Intellectuals , labourers , students , technocrats are all equal in work . We all work for the good of Society . Earnings must go to the workers , not to those who profit by others ' work . That is my System . That is real equality . That 's why I must do it now ! I agree with you . People are ... not so aware these days . We need to change the System . It 's far too cruel , too reactionary . Why don 't you help us change things ? To hell with your System . " Less cruel , less reactionary " ! It 's still the System , but of an even more revolting kind . It proves that you don 't understand how terrible the System is . You can 't help me . That 's why I must do this on my own . Right now . You can 't . You don 't even know the way to the Control Room . Follow the red lights . That 'll only lead to suffering and death . Hardly practical , eh ? Why not follow us ? Stay here . You can help us and some day I 'll take you to the Control Room . We need people like you , young , well-educated , who ... want to change things . And the work here isn 't ... particularly strenuous . That 's where the Machine is . Beautiful , isn 't it ? I like the quiet in there . Centuries of silence . It may be of interest to know that , of the seven young people remaining in this room , two more will shortly die and the others will continue to play the Game as hard as they can . Ask her if she wants anything to drink . Huh ? Take that thing out of her mouth and ask her if she wants a drink . - What for ? - Because I say so . Go on . Ask her . Not like that . For that you can untie her and do it properly . Fuck off . Basic humanity . That 's all that 's wrong with that boy . He is all right , isn 't he ? Good God almighty ! Colonel Norgren . What exactly is the meaning of this ? Two pork chops ! Colonel Yeng . Would it be too impertinent of me to enquire what your team is doing in the staff canteen ? I assure you they 're not wasting their time . They 're engaged in studying Chairman Mao 's thoughts on the rectification of incorrect ideas . Right ! If that 's the way we 're going to play ... Captain Davidsson , for our next move , we 'd like you to give the exact location of the staff canteen to the Allied troops and instruct them to go in there and smash the place up a bit ! And tell them to send the crockery bill to us . I don 't think they 'd care for that at the War House , Sir . Excuse me , General . Regrettably , it 's not your turn . Oh ? No . It 's mine instead . Attack ! Crush the paper tiger ! Long live Chairman Mao 's thoughts ! Good God ! Make contact with the enemy . Follow the red lights . Do you speak English ? She doesn 't speak English , that one . Well , ask her . Do you speak English ? Hello , darling . How are you ? Fuck . I 'm very well . Thank you . Fuck . You stupid bastard ! Look what you 've done ! You 've been nothing but a menace all through the Game ! Come on with me ! This way ! Come back , you two ! My God , I 'll have you shot for this , B-6 ! Come back , you two ! The lights went green ! The red ones are there ! We must follow the red lights ! At this point in time , gentlemen , I think we should all pause to acknowledge the existence of a growing threat in our midst : collaboration . In our country , we have a saying . " If a finger becomes poisonous , cut it off to save the body " . Are you saying , then , Colonel , that you 're prepared to kill this girl as a punishment ? She is a traitor . Gentlemen , I will be frank . We may not see eye-to-eye on various things but , here , I think we are all of accord . So I ask that we now declare the Game an honorable tie so that we may combine our mutual efforts to eliminate these two subversive young perverts . I agree . She is a counter-revolutionary . And a traitor to her country . Do what you like with her . Well ... I 'm not sure . I 'm not sure we can do something like this . Then let your Machine do it for you . Yes . Yes . We 'll do that . Captain Davidsson , switch ICARUS to automatic mode . No . What has happened now ? Davidsson , what in God 's name is happening ? Captain Davidsson ? What in God 's name is happening ? Captain Davidsson ? But ... that 's impossible ! Technically impossible ! Dav David ... David ... David ... David ... Dav Dav vid vid ... It 's technically impossible ! Technically impossible ! Colonel Norgren , explain please . I want that damned Machine back on again ! Colonel Norgren ! Stop waffling , man , and get it back on again ! It 's your responsibility . - We 're doing our best . - You 'll do better than that ! Always remember , Sir . Two people equal one valve . Four people equal two valves . If it goes on like this , we shan 't have any Machine left , will we ? Captain Davidsson . Are you sure you can handle this situation ? We want those two people killed , you know . Captain Davidsson , I want this job done properly . I don 't want any mistakes . Is that clear , Captain Davidsson ? - What about the team , Sir ? - Huh ? Our team ? Let them carry on . Get some experience . Is it necessary for the audience to see this ? Absolutely necessary . I agree . I agree . Gentlemen , I fully agree . Essentially I disagree but reluctantly I agree . Sometimes you must do things like this people not like . Otherwise you look afraid . The aggressive tone of West German imperialism forces the German Democratic Republic to be strong in order to defend the very basis of socialism . Socialism is the only guarantee for world peace . Absolutely . Quite correct . India cannot isolate herself . She has to live in the community of nations . Under the impact of these inevitable circumstances that are outside of control , we sometimes have to twist matters in conflict with our conscience . Leniency always has its place , gentlemen , but , as a young nation , Nigeria has to recognize the need for strength through discipline . Shan 't keep you a moment , Sir . Yes ... Thank you . That 's very good . Could you come in just a little that way , Sir ? Thank you very , very much . That 's fine . Good . Yes . That 's super . Always remember , Sir . Two people equal one valve . Four people equal two valves . If it goes on like this , we shan 't have any Machine left . S 'il you plaît ... Merci . I shan 't be a second . Yes . Good . Right . Perfect . Yes . Right , thank you . That 's very good . Could you come in just a little that way , Sir ? Thank you very , very much . Right , gentlemen , here we go . I 'm going to take it now . Yes . Thanks . That 's fine , Sir . Right . Thank you . Right . That 's absolutely marvellous . Can you hang on for a second ? I 've won the Game . I 'm the first to get here . - Do you want to use this ? - No , that won 't change anything . It doesn 't matter . ICARUS will translate for us . Sit down a bit . I 'm going to destroy all this . And then what , B-3 ? I 'll build a new System in its place . But do you know how ... to operate all this ? Do you know what all the buttons are ? Your System or someone else 's ... It takes time , knowledge and practice . Stay here and try to learn about the Machine , instead of destroying it . Why not ? No . I won 't let myself be used that way . Listen , B-3 ... The Machine uses all of us . It uses them . And them . And them . And , of course , it uses me . You ? Yes . The Machine uses me more than anyone else because I , of course , know it 's using me . The Machine will never use me . I 'll never let it use me . I said that once . Maybe , but I am stronger than you . The Machine has already used you ... when you switched it on again . That was my idea , to find the red lights and the way here . No , sorry . That was the Machine . It needed its power back to deal with B-6 and C-2 . They were the only two who were a real danger to the Machine . And therefore it had to get rid of them . And so it got you to do it . Perhaps ... But when I have my System , no-one will ever be exploited again . No . That 's not so , B-3 . Your System or someone else 's ... They 're all the same .

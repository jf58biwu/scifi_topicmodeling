 - This Game doesn 't concern me . - Why ? There 's been too much death and destruction already . I 'm from Da Nang , in the middle of Vietnam . Yes . Yes . I am here to destroy the System , so that this Game no longer exists . - THE GLADIATORS - Producer Screenplay Director of Photography Did you check the red circuit ? Yes . Music Executive Producer Editor - Director Davidsson here . We have a problem with DISTORTED VALUES again . Tell them ... to send up coffee at eleven . We still have a flicker on RECIPROCAL INSTABILITY . And I believe ... there 's still a malfunction on SLOW MOTION MURDER . They don 't interest me at all . They all talk of patriotism , of honour , democracy , the fight against Communism ... and don 't understand that all these ideas are given them by the System so it can use them better . They 're completely unaware of the tragedy of the world in which we live . In 10 minutes they 'll still be there convincing themselves of grand reasons for fighting but the Game will no longer exist . I 'm going to destroy that fucking Machine . We 'll have trouble with that one . - Who is that idiot ? - We can check . What 's his number ? B-3 Green . One of our splendid so-called " Allies " . Not at the moment . But I know that , when I finish University and go back to everyday society , the System will try to absorb me . That 's why I 'm here now . I refuse to let that happen . I 'm determined to destroy the System before it uses me ... and everyone else . We 'll use Program No. 17 today . 700 million Chinese armed with Mao 's thoughts are 700 million atom bombs . If I want to destroy the System , I have to be violent . But those who are already there , who are violent against us , the bourgeois call " law and order " . They don 't call them violent . I have the right to say what I think and to study at the university . I 'm forced to be violent to achieve things . The System forces me . - How much are you giving him ? - 750 volts . - Usually rising to 1,000 . - Serves him right , loud-mouthed jerk . Maybe . He shows endurance , though . Bastards ! Shit ! Goddamit ! God , my stomach 's lousy today . Fuckers ! Shit ! Goddamit ! Fuckers ! Damn ! Plan 10B , overall attack on enemy ! Long live Chairman Mao 's thoughts ! Good morning . They call you our Allies . You burn our villages and kill children and women . Engineer Rundelius ? Would you please be so very kind and turn on the steam for the jungle ? Burial Officer , please . Ekstr√∂m ? Davidsson here . We have a " Killed In Action " for you in 23 minutes . Yes , we have his footprints . ICARUS seems to be pushing him towards a climax . I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again . This Machine needs reprogramming . It 's far too ... unsubtle . - Where are your comrades ? - I don 't know . Keep your hands up ! - Where are your comrades ? - I don 't know . Hands up . Hands up . Keep your hands up . Where are your comrades ? Let all be happy . Let no-one suffer from want . Let everyone see good around him . And let none be miserable . 27 . 25 . No entry . Government property . What 's that ? Government property ! It 's the Control Room . Damn ! - You can 't go in there . - Let me pass . I 've no time to lose ! Don 't you understand ? Let me through ! Do I have to use this ? Don 't mess with that ! What 's this place ? What do you want ? Or rather , what do you want ? You know perfectly well . First , to destroy this whole mess . Will they appreciate it , do you think ? They 'll understand perfectly . That 's why I don 't want any delay . There 's no need to explain . They don 't understand why ... They don 't think ... That 's why the present System is one of such discrimination . Your System ... What will that be like ? My System ? I 'm going to establish a new idea of work and workers . Intellectuals , labourers , students , technocrats are all equal in work . We all work for the good of Society . Earnings must go to the workers , not to those who profit by others ' work . That is my System . That is real equality . That 's why I must do it now ! I agree with you . People are ... not so aware these days . We need to change the System . It 's far too cruel , too reactionary . Why don 't you help us change things ? To hell with your System . " Less cruel , less reactionary " ! It 's still the System , but of an even more revolting kind . It proves that you don 't understand how terrible the System is . You can 't help me . That 's why I must do this on my own . Right now . You can 't . You don 't even know the way to the Control Room . Follow the red lights . That 'll only lead to suffering and death . Hardly practical , eh ? Why not follow us ? Stay here . You can help us and some day I 'll take you to the Control Room . We need people like you , young , well-educated , who ... want to change things . And the work here isn 't ... particularly strenuous . That 's where the Machine is . Beautiful , isn 't it ? I like the quiet in there . Centuries of silence . Two pork chops ! Attack ! Crush the paper tiger ! Long live Chairman Mao 's thoughts ! Do you speak English ? The lights went green ! The red ones are there ! We must follow the red lights ! I agree . She is a counter-revolutionary . And a traitor to her country . Do what you like with her . Captain Davidsson , switch ICARUS to automatic mode . Davidsson , what in God 's name is happening ? Captain Davidsson ? What in God 's name is happening ? Captain Davidsson ? But ... that 's impossible ! Technically impossible ! It 's technically impossible ! Technically impossible ! Captain Davidsson , I want this job done properly . I don 't want any mistakes . Is that clear , Captain Davidsson ? I agree . The aggressive tone of West German imperialism forces the German Democratic Republic to be strong in order to defend the very basis of socialism . Socialism is the only guarantee for world peace . Absolutely . Quite correct . I 've won the Game . I 'm the first to get here . No , that won 't change anything . It doesn 't matter . ICARUS will translate for us . Sit down a bit . I 'm going to destroy all this . And then what , B-3 ? I 'll build a new System in its place . But do you know how ... to operate all this ? Do you know what all the buttons are ? Your System or someone else 's ... It takes time , knowledge and practice . Stay here and try to learn about the Machine , instead of destroying it . Why not ? No . I won 't let myself be used that way . Listen , B-3 ... The Machine uses all of us . It uses them . And them . And them . And , of course , it uses me . You ? Yes . The Machine uses me more than anyone else because I , of course , know it 's using me . The Machine will never use me . I 'll never let it use me . I said that once . Maybe , but I am stronger than you . The Machine has already used you ... when you switched it on again . That was my idea , to find the red lights and the way here . No , sorry . That was the Machine . It needed its power back to deal with B-6 and C-2 . They were the only two who were a real danger to the Machine . And therefore it had to get rid of them . And so it got you to do it . Perhaps ... But when I have my System , no-one will ever be exploited again . No . That 's not so , B-3 . Your System or someone else 's ... They 're all the same .

Your clothes don 't fit proper ! - Maybe you can recommend a tailor . - Too much responsibility . Tailoring 's personal . You here on holiday ? Sorte . I 'm going to the Witley place . You 're not . - Something wrong ? - Nothing wrong . - Can you tell me how to get there ? - No . Sorry , mate . - I wonder if you could help me . - Possibly . I 'm anxious to get to the Witley place . Sorry . I can 't help you . Can you help me ? Excuse me . This man following me . He 's asking for the Witley place . Here he comes . Hello . Is there any place around here where I can rent an automobile ? No . Bicycle , maybe . Where are you going ? - The Witley place . - You 're wasting your time . - How d 'you figure that ? - The Witley place ! He wants to go to the Witley place ! Anything wrong with wanting to go there ? - Is there anything wrong with that ? - Well , is there ? - Bicycle shop 's down the street . - " ls there ? " he asks ! - Hello . - Something you want ? I 'd like to rent a bicycle for a few days . Where would you be riding it ? I 'll pay for it in advance . - I asked where you 'd be going . - To the Witley place . - I 'd need a bicycle , wouldn 't I ? - Yes . And more than that . You 'll not be using one of mine . Why ? You 've got loads . I don 't see anybody waiting . - No bicycles for rent . - What about the motor ? I 've nothing for rent . What will it cost to get to the Witley place ? More than anything you have to offer . Why ? What 's the matter with everybody in this town ? Nothing 's the matter . Here . Just what 's that supposed to mean ? It means the only way you can get to the Witley house from here is on your own two feet . Hello ? Hello ? How do you do ? There was no answer so I took the liberty of entering . The signs clearly say to keep out . You must have seen them . Oh , yes . I saw them . By what right have you entered this house ? - I 've come to visit the Witleys . - Oh ? I am Nahum Witley . Well , sir , actually it 's Susan I came to visit . Susan ? My daughter 's not receiving visitors . I must ask you to leave . - This the way you treat your guests ? - Guests ? Guests are invited . - I don 't remember inviting you . - Oh , I have been invited . By Mrs Witley . " Stephen Reinhart " . You are Stephen Reinhart ? Uh , yeah . That 's right . My daughter did mention your name . She met you in America at university ? - We were in the same science class . - Science ! It would disturb Mrs Witley to see you . Again , I must ask you to leave . - It isn 't her I 've come to see . - Quite impossible . I will have Merwyn take you to the village . Steve ! Susan will ask you to stay . But for reasons I cannot go into , I must insist you tell her that you have to leave at once . Merwyn ! Get the car . Steve ! Susan ! - You look great ! - I thought you 'd never get here . - It 's only been a month . - Is that all ? - Father , this is Stephen Reinhart . - I know . - I must speak to you alone , Susan . - I 'll take him to meet Mother . It 's forbidden for your mother to have visitors . Only for a minute . Mother 's been waiting to meet Steve . I had no idea you lived in a house so , uh ... sumptuous . This is my great-grandfather , Elias Witley . He built this house over 150 years ago . This next one ? It 's my grandfather , Corbin Witley . Oh ? What did he do ? He went insane . We must get rid of him , Merwyn . He must not stay . Steve , you must understand about Mother . She 's not well . Mother ? Come in and close the door . Mother , this is Stephen Reinhart . We have been expecting you . I 'm , uh ... I 'm sorry you 're not feeling well , Mrs Witley . It will pass . You are a welcome guest in this house , Mr Reinhart . - Thank you . - My husband will protest . - But I shall speak to him . Susan ? - Yes ? I would like to speak to Stephen alone . Yes , Mother . Please , sit down . I am glad that you have come at this time . Merwyn ! Merwyn , are you all right ? Yes , sir . I 'm going to need your help . You can trust me , sir . - About what , Mrs Witley ? - Come here . Closer . That box , Mr Reinhart , there . Open it . - It 's an earring . - Yes . It 's an earring . Take it out of the box . Examine it . - Looks like gold . - Yes . It 's gold . But its importance doesn 't lie in the metal it is made of . - I 'm afraid I don 't understand . - Why should you ? You probably think this whole house is obsessed with mystery . I tell you , that single earring you are holding is surrounded by mystery . It ... It belonged to my maid , Helga . She was a nice simple girl and completely devoted to me . Well , about a month ago , she went down with some terrible disease . I begged her to go to the doctor in Arkham . - Did she go ? - No . No , I don 't think she did . Chains for devils ! Whatever it was , she seemed to be overcome by ... by something , well ... Well , it almost seemed like self-loathing . She took to wearing a veil as if to hide herself from prying eyes . Why , um ... Why is the earring so important ? About a fortnight ago , she came here to see me . She was crying . She said she was ... she was frightened of what was happening to her . - What was happening to her ? - I don 't know . I 'm not sure . Anyway , she left , and she dropped that earring . Stephen , I haven 't seen her since . Well , perhaps Mr Witley knows . My husband says he knows nothing . Stephen , it 's because of all these things that I had to be sure of you . You are my one hope for Susan . Take her away from here as soon as you can . Tomorrow . The next day . You must promise me . My husband may not allow me to speak to you again . I must have your promise now . - What did you talk about ? - What ? Oh ! You . I want you to know , I have the parental blessing . Well , half of it , anyway . - My room 's supposed to be down here . - I 'll show you . This is the room . I 'll have Merwyn bring up your case . Susan , how long has your mother been like that ? Ill , you mean ? Well , that and the uh , darkened room , shaded bed . Not long . She 's been worse the past few days . And the doctor 's forbidden her to have any visitors ? No , she hasn 't seen a doctor . Father wants to look after her himself . - And what about Helga ? - Helga ? Why all these questions ? Your mother 's very concerned about her . She 's disappeared . Susan , what 's going on here ? I don 't know , Steve . What else did you and Mother talk about ? Come here . Your mother did ask whether my intentions were honourable . - Are they , Steve ? - What do you think ? You shouldn 't have invited Reinhart here . You 're a difficult woman , Letitia . No . Not difficult . Only afraid . Oh , so that 's it , huh ? The sins of the fathers , huh ? Well , let me warn you , nothing is going to deter me from my purpose . - Yes , that 's what Corbin said . - He 's dead , Letitia . He 's been dead for a long time . If there was evil , it 's buried with him . All that remains of Corbin is a few harmless objects in the cellar . - No ! You know how light pains me ! - Why persist in this delusion ? Please , Nahum , close the curtains . Please . I wonder if you realise how like Corbin you 've become . There 's no similarity whatsoever . I 've uttered no incantations . Neither have I cried out to any of the other so-called ... creatures of evil . - It 's only your methods that differ . - And do you know why ? Because I don 't believe in it . I never have believed in it . It is you who would perpetuate these blasphemies , these absurdities . Nahum , I saw your father change from an upright God-fearing man into an old man possessed of the devil . Whatever happened to my father will not happen to me . It 's already happening . I could see it happening to you , Letitia , not to me . It 's happening to all of us . There 's evidence of it all around us . There is nothing to do with Corbin Witley . Corbin was invoking the dark powers when he died . Now , his call is being answered . So that is why you sent for Stephen Reinhart . I sent for him to take Susan away . - What have you told him ? - Nothing . - Are you sure ? - I don 't need to tell him anything . - He can see for himself . - I don 't want him here . - One way or another , he must leave . - He is a guest here , Nahum . I will not have him interfering . Would you prefer that I went into the town and showed myself ? The once beautiful Letitia Witley . Very well . A day , perhaps , but no more . Then he must leave . Well , perhaps by then you will have seen the truth . The truth ? The truth is that I see the future , and all that I 've planned will fill it with a richness we 've never known . Yes , that is what you see . All that I can see is horror . Horror ! I 'm sorry , sir . This is a very large room . Big enough for a king 's banquet . There used to be many parties here in my great-grandfather 's time . - But none since ? - None that I remember . - Why not ? - I don 't know . Perhaps the name of Witley no longer commands the affection and respect it once did . Is that why no one in the village would drive me out here ? - You had to walk all that way ? - Mm . The villagers have no use for us , Mr Reinhart . The feeling is mutual . - Merwyn . - Yes ? Has Mrs Witley had her dinner ? I placed a tray before her , but she didn 't want it . I 'll take her up something a little later , Father . What was that ? Uh , Mr Witley , I um ... noticed a strange blackened area on the way to the house . What happened there ? - There was a fire , Steve . - A fire ? - Why do you say it like that ? - Well , did you see it ? No , but Father did . - Why are you so curious ? - Everything is dead in the area . Nothing grows . I touched a branch and it fell to ashes . My daughter had already told you . There was a fire . But , Mr Witley , no fire leaves a place like that . Father 's never allowed me to go on the heath . - Why not ? - I don 't know . After the fire , some villagers disappeared there . No one 's ever explained what happened . I think , Susan , you 're inclined to exaggerate . I would suggest that you both ... Merwyn ! - What 's the matter with him ? - This has happened before . - But he 's unconscious . - It 's perfectly all right . I know exactly what to do . Susan . Come on , Steve . Steve . Mother ? I 've brought your dinner . It 's your favourite . - Take it away . - You must eat . Sh . Quiet , child . Listen . - What is it ? - Sh ! Quiet . Yes . Yes ! - Steve ! - What 's wrong , honey ? - I saw something outside the window . - What ? Who ? I don 't know , but something was staring at me . Are you sure you weren 't imagining it ? - Oh , I don 't know . It 's this house ! - What about this house , Susan ? There 's something in it , something smothering . - I 'm taking you away . - I wish I could ... - Tonight ! - I can 't . - Why ? - I can 't leave Mother how she is . First she couldn 't stand the light . Now she won 't eat . It was your mother who made me promise to take you away . - I want to go . - We 're leaving right away . - It 's impossible . - Tomorrow morning , then . I 'm afraid she won 't be any better in the morning . Oh , Steve . I wish I knew what to do . - Steve ! - What ? The window ! - Nothing . It 's your imagination . - I 'm not imagining it . We 'll discuss it tomorrow . Now , you have to get some rest . Oh , Steve . I love you . And I love you . Everything 's gonna be all right . It came from downstairs . - Where does this go ? - It leads to Merwyn 's room . - Father ! - You shouldn 't come here . But the screaming and the noise . It 's Merwyn . He 's dead . It was terrible . Please go back to your rooms . Nobody can do anything to help now . Now , wait a minute . What 's this all about ? How did he die ? - He 's been ill for a long time . - Where 's the body ? - That 's none of your business . - I think it is my business . - No , Steve ... - You don 't realise what 's happened . This is my house . I ask you to allow me to run my own affairs my own way . - But a man is dead ! - Steve ! - Get dressed . We 're gonna leave now . - I can 't leave now , Steve . Please don 't make trouble . Good night . Good night . - Yes ? - Is the doctor in ? - Did you have an appointment ? - No , but I 'd like to speak to him . - Is it an emergency ? - It 's important that I speak to him . Come inside . This way . - You wanted to speak to me ? - Dr Henderson ? Steve Reinhart . I had to talk to you . Nobody in the village recommended me , I 'm sure . - I found you in the phone book . - I 've been out of practice for some time . I didn 't come to see you in your professional capacity . I ... Something funny 's happening . The family I 'm staying with may be involved . - Why come to me ? Oh , drink ? - No , thanks . It 's a little early . I thought someone objective could help me , give me some information . - About what ? - About the people I 'm staying with . Why was everyone frightened when I said where I was going ? Frightened ? You 're talking about the Witley place . Only " Witley " could bring out that reaction . - Can you tell me why ? - Sorry , I can 't tell you anything . An old man died out there last night . I don 't give one damn what happened there , neither does this village . You 're scared . You 're a doctor , don 't you have pride in what you are ? - I may have seen a murder . - Murder ? - That 's right . - I 'm sorry , I can 't help . Go away . You too . What 's happened here ? Why is there that fear when " Witley " is mentioned ? Miss Bailey . Will you show Mr Reinhart to the door ? You asked the doctor about the Witley place . Can you tell me anything about it , anything about the Witleys ? Only this . Dr Henderson was a good doctor , a wonderful man . Corbin Witley died in Dr Henderson 's arms . Dr Henderson returned from that visit and he 's never been the same . - What did Corbin Witley die from ? - It 's never spoken of . On the death certificate it said cerebral haemorrhage , but there was no autopsy because there was no funeral , and I 'll tell you why . With the exception of Dr Henderson , no one in the village saw the body . I 've said enough . I 've said more than I ought . Mother ? Mother , please let me in . - Susan , dear . - I heard her moving about . - Mother , please open this door . - It 's all right . I 'll talk to her . - I 've tried to ... - I know , dear . Now , you go along . I 'll talk to her . Letitia , I must speak to you . It 's very important . Letitia ! But no one ever goes to the greenhouse at night . If there was no one inside , why was there a light ? - A light ? - The entire greenhouse ... the only word I can think of is glowed . I 've seen a glow like that before , in a radiation lab . I don 't understand . What were you doing outside last night ? - I was watching your father . - Father ? - What was he doing ? - Burying Merwyn . - Something else has happened , too . - What ? I was attacked on the heath . I 'm sure it was Helga . Oh , Steve . What 's happening ? - Why is the greenhouse locked ? - It never has been before . - Well , it is now . - Well , it shouldn 't be . - Have you been in it lately ? - Not since I 've been back . Come on . Letitia , now listen to me . It 's very important . I should have done this before . I 'm going to take you to the village , to see the doctor . Letitia . How long have these windows been whitewashed ? - They 've always been whitewashed . - There . - I 've never seen that lock before . - Is there any other way in ? Steve , I don 't think we should . The answer to what 's going on may be inside . We 've got to get in . I know a way . When I was a child , I 'd hide from Merwyn when Mother sent him for me . I used to get in somewhere here . Here it is . - I see it , but I don 't believe it . - How could plants grow like this ? It 's fantastic ! Yeah . How can this happen ? - What was that ? - I don 't know . Remember the cry we heard at dinner last night ? I heard one just like it this morning . What 's in there ? It used to be a potting shed . Oh , come on , Steve ! It 's dark in there , except for a kind of glow . Oh , Steve ! Please come away ! We can 't . There 's something going on that 's affecting all your family . We shouldn 't . If Father finds out he 'll be furious . Let him . We 're not leaving with questions unanswered . Stay here . No . - I 'm coming with you . - OK . Come on . - What is it ? - Those flickering colours . It must be some kind of energy . Uranium ! This room is being exposed to some form of radiation . It 's horrible . It looks like a zoo in hell . Oh , come on , Steve ! Come on ! It 's all right ! A menagerie of horrors . What were they ? Genetic mutations , probably caused by radiation . It 's a scientific fact that exposure to radioactive energy can change characteristics of living things . It 's what happened to these plants , to those creatures . The scent in here . It 's so sweet . It 's sickening . It 's the effect of decay . - Steve , what is it ? - There 's something down here . This stone 's like the ones in the potting shed . What is it , Steve ? I don 't know . I 've never seen anything like it before . I wonder if it 's an element . It 's giving off heat ! Looks like it 's been cut away from some larger stone . There 's one under every plant . This is the answer . No doubt about it . - The stones ? - Yeah . They make everything in here grow this way ? Yeah , and in there , too . Oh , but Steve ! If it does this to plants ... Exactly , if it affects plants this way after hours and days of exposure , what would it do to a human being ? Mother and Helga . They worked in here . Merwyn must have come in contact with these stones , or the larger one from which they were cut ! I wonder where the larger stone could be . I don 't know . In the cellar , perhaps . - The cellar ! - There are many rooms down there . Come on . - You all right ? - Yes . Letitia . Letitia ! That 's the door . - You stay here . - You won 't find the way . - I will . Now , go upstairs . - Oh , Steve . Be careful . Don 't worry . Where 's Reinhart ? I 've been looking for him . - What happened ? Where have you been ? - The greenhouse . - I put a lock on . - I knew another way in . - You had no right . - Why have you kept it a secret ? - Was Reinhart with you ? - Yes . - Is he still there ? - No . Where is he ? Where is he ? - You 're hurting me ! - Tell me where he is . - He 's in the cellar . - The cellar ! - Father ! - Stay there ! Get out of this room . I said , get out . No . Not until you listen to what I have to say . - I 'm in no mood for words ! - Would you prefer death ? - Don 't threaten me . - Everything in this house will die . Get rid of that stone and the smaller ones , or this house will become like the burned-out area , those monstrosities . - You don 't know what you 're saying . - It destroyed Merwyn . You want it to destroy your wife , Susan , destroy you ? - No . - Listen to that humming sound . Look at the way it glows . - It 's only a stone . It 's harmless . - You don 't believe that , Mr Witley . You know what it can do . You know Mrs Witley needs a doctor ! Susan . Are you all right ? - Susan ! - Oh , Steve . What happened ? It 's all right . I got you now . Susan , are you all right ? - What happened to your mother ? - I don 't know . I heard her smashing things . I tried to get her to come out . And then the door burst open and I screamed . I don 't remember anything after that . Can you get up now ? - I think so . - Come on . - Are you OK ? - I 'll be all right . I must find Letitia . - I must help . - No . Come on . Letitia ! Letitia ! Come on . Letitia ! Let 's try this way . Letitia ! Father ? It 's only the wind . Come on . Letitia . Steve ! No ! Reinhart , get my daughter out of here . Please take Susan away . The evil that Corbin created has finally come to root here . I refused to listen to her entreaties . Now Letitia 's paid with her life for Corbin 's blasphemies . And my own , too . Mr Witley , blasphemy had nothing to do with it . In my heart , I must have known that she was right . It is as she said . A curse is set upon this house . How could I have been so blind as not to know that stone was sent from the other side by the hand of Corbin , reaching out from beyond the grave ? - A curse ? - What do you know of this house ? - Or the people who 've lived in it ? - The stone was not sent by anyone . It 's easy for you to say that , but you didn 't see it that Sunday morning , screaming out of the heavens to crash and bury itself in the heath . It fell from the sky ! Then it was a meteorite . I thought it was a gift from Heaven . The people from the village came to see , but they wouldn 't come near it . They knew because the fear of Corbin was still in them . The next morning , the heath was covered with a lush vegetation that should never have grown there . Why did you bring it into the house ? Why ? Because I thought , as Corbin knew I would ... I thought I 'd found a way to turn the wasteland into a place of beauty . Great vineyards , gardens . That was my dream . I thought the name of Witley would mean something once again , and Corbin 's iniquities would be atoned for . Everyone he came in contact with was touched by it . Father , please come back into the house . Susan ! Stephen , will you take Susan away , please ? What about you ? I will stay here to destroy this monstrous thing . If you go near it , there can only be one result , and you know what it is . You seem to forget this is my home . I live here . And I , like my father and his father before him , was born here . I 'm an old man and if I 'm to die , - I will die here . - I 'm not leaving without you , Father . Susan , there 's nothing we can do . Let 's go . Something dreadful 's going to happen . Now , please ! Susan , go with Stephen . Go away ! Go away ! Come on . Let 's go and pack . Helga ! That 'll do . Come on . - Father ! - Stay here . Mr Witley ! Susan ! Get back ! Come on . Get over there . When I say run , head for the door . Go ahead . No ! Come on ! - Run , Susan ! Run ! - Steve ! Susan ! Susan ! Hold on ! Oh , Steve . We 're going and we 're not gonna look back . I don 't understand , Steve . Why did all this have to happen ? I don 't think it had to happen . In scientific hands , your father 's discovery could have been beneficial . He used it to fight the only way he knew , for his house and the Witley name . It was his choice and he made it . Come on , let 's get outta here . Visiontext Subtitles : . Fran Welland ENHOH

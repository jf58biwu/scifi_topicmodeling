 Captain ! Oh , Captain , we are going to make it , aren 't we ? Of course we are . This here is the finest , most powerful boat on the river , the Delta Belle . We 've got armed guards in there , the best pilot on the Mississippi . Nothing 's going to happen to us , Miss Previne . I sincerely hope not , Captain . I sincerely hope not . Yes , ma 'am . If there 's anything I learned about this rotten business dead men tell no tales . Where are we ? I just got a flash of the steeple in Springfield . I 'm laying her over to it now . By thunder , I think we 're going to make it . Did you doubt it ? You know darn well I did . So did you . If it hadn 't been for that bonus , I 'd never have left New Orleans . Yeah . Three more hours , and we 're in Vicksburg , safe and sound . Pray God . Watch it ! Look out for the rocks ! There 's the steeple , the steeple ! Out of my way ! Get out of there ! Move ! Got word they fished his body out of the river two hours ago . That 's the fourth investigator we 've lost in as many weeks . Moore , Fisher , O 'Neill , now Hackett . And all of the causes listed as accidental . Hackett was a good swimmer . I don 't believe he drowned . You think he might have been aboard the Delta Belle when she went down ? The others were fished out of the river , too . That makes it just too coincidental for me , Artemus . They must have been onto something . Or somebody . Remember , Artemus , there hasn 't been a trace of the boat or any cargo . The only clue we have is a roulette chip from The Pot of Gold . Hackett 's luck . He didn 't live long enough to cash it in . So , now I 'll try mine . Uh , book says there 's a law against us Secret Service fellows gambling , remember ? It 's our only lead . At least it 's a place . You cover the river section of Fitch Landing , and work your way up to me . I 'll be glad to . It 's only 150 miles . Jim ? Put that on number 13 , will you ? For Hackett . Welcome , sir . Welcome to The Pot of Gold . Blackjack , poker , dice , roulette . Take your pick of the table , sir . And no limits . It 's quite a place you have here . Or I had . The river 's dying on its feet . The boats , disappearing . Yes , it 's got so everybody 's afraid to go on the river anymore . The whole tourist trade - shot into Hades . This chip come from your casino ? My hobby is remembering faces , and I , uh ... I 've never seen you in action around here before . A friend of mine couldn 't come tonight . He gave me this chip to play for him . His name 's Hackett . Hackett . Hackett . Oh , yes . Hackett . Real unlucky fellow . Yeah . Real unlucky . Never cried , though , like a lot of them cry when they lose . If he did cry , he won 't cry anymore . He took a long trip . Oh . Seems like black could be your friend 's color . Call me Crystal . James West . Well , take care of Mr. West , Crystal . Very good care . James ? Jim ? Or Mr. West ? Take your choice . Black . Let it ride . My friend never play at your table ? A lot of men played at my table . Names , faces - they 're all one to me . You think I 'd remember . It 's nice to be remembered . Seems like your friend 's luck could be changing . That would be an improvement . What time do you finish ? 3 : 00 . Will you have dinner with me , or should I say breakfast at that hour ? I 'm afraid not . You are lucky , Mr. West . Does that mean you 've changed your mind about dinner tonight ? Aah ! Why did you set me up ? Get out of here . Not until you answer some questions . I have nothing to say . You were cheating , letting me win . Why ? I like you . You know that . Then why are you running away ? They were supposed to find me with my pockets turned inside out and dead , and not ask too many questions . That was the idea , wasn 't it ? A victim of robbery . No . No . You 're repeating yourself . It 's time for some " yes " answers . Let 's begin with , " Yes . " What do you know about my friend Hackett , and , yes , who put you up to this ? You 've gotten me all wrong . Convince me . There was no one . Then I 'll have to convince you . Hackett was working for the government . So am I. Hackett was murdered , and so were three other government agents before him . And tonight , they tried to kill me . A simple accident . Who knows ? Maybe you 're next . Another accident . No ! You 're still repeating yourself . Or maybe it won 't be the river . A simple drowning . Or maybe they have something special in mind for you , Crystal . I-I was given the message . Instructions to let you win . I was going to be paid . Who by ? I don 't know . Crystal ? I don 't know . C ... Co ... Coffin . Coffin . I can forgive a mistake made by a man . None of us are all that perfect . I can excuse a misjudgment , underestimation , even a failure . Mr. West is not an ordinary man , but cowardice - that is unforgivable . Wouldn 't you say so , Poavey ? Wouldn 't you say , Poavey ? ! I wouldn 't do nothing like that , Captain . Liar ! Poavey ... it 's written in your eyes . You 're the liar , Captain ! You can 't see anything with them eyes . I can see right through them to your rotten soul . Your heart bleeds yellow ! No man calls Poavey a coward ! Coward ! Coward ... Get rid of him quickly . And now , Oriana , we must devote some thought to Mr. West . His train is still going north . He himself remains here . He 's a dangerous man , and that requires something quite out of the ordinary . Jennifer ... Wingate - we 've called on her before - several times . Is she ... beautiful ? But beautiful enough to interest a man like Mr. West ? But not as beautiful as you ... Oriana . So lovely . So uniquely ... lovely . Oh , Oriana , my golden one . Send a message of instruction to Jennifer Wingate . Tell her to make contact with James West . She has never failed ... to kill . I tell you , Jim , this crew would put Captain Kidd to shame - one speck of debris from The Dixie Belle found floating 100 miles downstream from here . What I 'd like to know is how he does it . And who 's Coffin ? Right . That 's all the poor girl said , huh ? " Coffin " ? That 's all she had time to say . That bar of soap on the floor - could you hand it to me , please ? Well , it could be the fellow 's voice is changing , Jim . Could be . Clumsy . Now , will you please hand me the soap and get out of here ? But lady , you 're on the wrong side . Jim ... I know , but the ladies ' side is occupied . Jim , don 't be so old-fashioned , will you ? In Japan , everybody bathes together . This is not Japan . Ah . this is not Japan . And you have more investigating to do . Uh , y-y-yeah , l-look , let me just clean up a little bit ... There 's no need , uh ... If you were a gentleman , you would leave with your friend . And if you were a lady , you wouldn 't be here in the first place . Would you like me to call the manager ? Under the circumstances , that might be very interesting . I 'll wait outside . Oh , oh , sir ... Name 's West ... James West . Mr. West , would you kindly hand me that towel , please ? Discreetly . I 'm always discreet . The towel , please . For some reason , bathing invariably gives me an appetite . It often has the same effect on me . Wonderful - then we can have dinner tonight . We can share a finger bowl . Hardly . We haven 't been properly introduced . My name 's James , and yours ? Jennifer Wingate . Now , the towel , please , Mr. West . James . Dinner ? Dinner . Mmm ... Mister ... I heard you was looking for someone . Well , if I were looking for someone , sugar , I could stop right now , huh ? What , uh , friendly thing did you have in mind ? Conversation ? Charming way to start . What 'll we talk about first ? What you want to know about . Facts of life ? Ask me anything . I suppose the first subject of conversation should be money , huh ? I don 't want your money . Well , that 's interesting . What , then ? Revenge . Aw ... a woman scorned . A father killed ! Cold blood , just like that . I want to see the man who killed him dead . Coffin ? Coffin . Ansel Coffin . What 'd your father have to do with Coffin ? He was one of his men . Not that I excuse him for helping do Coffin 's dirty work ... but no human should be choked like a rat ! Sugar , I want Coffin more than you do . Where do I find him ? I don 't know . He 's got a place ... hidden away . My father would never say where . Sugar , you 're not helping me . It 's your friend who needs the help . Friend ? Now what friend would that be ? Jim West . Jim West ... Jim ... West . He 's gonna be dead . Coffin hired somebody to kill him . You do know something , don 't you ? Who ? A girl ... Jennifer . Her name is Jennifer Wingate . Thank you , Miss , uh ... Poavey . Glory Poavey . Thank you , Miss Poavey . I 'll talk with you again sometime . Next time you talk to me , tell me about Coffin 's funeral . Miss Poavey , it 'll be a pleasure . I complement myself on this dish , Mr. West - a recipe handed down through several generations of my family . Old World or New ? Does that make a difference ? It has been said that the Old World recipes were so highly seasoned that they disguised their true taste and flavor . Such as , Mr. West ? You may go now , Arnold . Such as was the custom of the vendetta in the Old World . You mean that such dishes often contained poison ? That has been said . We 're not related , so you , of course , would have nothing like that to worry about . Of course . And why would a girl like you want to revenge herself against a charming , defenseless man like me anyway ? I would never use poison . What would you use ? Let us have some secrets from each other ... shall we ? I suppose everyone has their own style ... you yours , I mine . The luxury of choice is always in the hands of the aggressor . I 'm the passive type . Which are you at the moment ? You 're not afraid of me , Mr. West ? You 're a woman . If I weren 't afraid of you , I 'd be a reckless fool . And my lips ... do they frighten you , too ? Especially your lips . Be a reckless fool , darling . Try mine . I don 't know you that well . You talk too much . Who 's Coffin ? I suppose I 'll have to tell you now . Why fight it ? I 'm afraid I singed your bullet-proof vest . That 's all right . I 'll send it to the foundry for repairs . I 'm sorry , darling . Think nothing of it . It 's insured . Do you ever take it off ? Only on my birthday . Happy birthday , darling . About Coffin . It would have been a shame to have killed you , darling . Some other time . You were saying about Coffin , darling ? He does want you killed . You 'd be flattered at how much money I was going to be paid . Of course , there was nothing personal about it . Naturally . I like your style , Mr. West . Now , why don 't you take off your bullet-proof vest ? About Coffin , and riverboats , and Old World recipes ? It 's a way of life , and one does have to live these days . I pass on information about every riverboat that passes by . The name , destination , cargo , that sort of thing . What 's the information for ? I don 't know . The boats are being wrecked . How about the cargos ? Stolen , and then sold . The passengers ? Killed . You 're a naughty girl , Jennifer . I don 't want to be ... not really . If you mean what you say , take me to where Coffin is . When I shot you , it was a signal to Arnold . He released a pigeon . The message said you were dead . But you and I know differently . Pity . About what ? When I do take you to Coffin , he will kill you . Like you said ... a way of life . Well , now , shall we eat ? Delicious . Delicious , darling . Cozy surroundings . Like a graveyard , darling . It 's not too late to turn back . You tempt me , Jennifer . Maybe in some other life . If you live that long . Thank you for waiting , gentlemen . I brought him to you . I sent word so you 'd be ready for him . I told you to kill him , not to bring him here . I tried . You failed . No one comes here unless I send for them . I do not tolerate such failure . I will decide what to do with her later . She did the best she could , Captain Coffin . It 's not her fault I 'm still alive . But not for long , Mr. West . My companions - scum , riffraff , cutthroats from every treacherous coast in the world . Zanzibar , Hatteras , Key West , Cornwall ... Wreckers , and none better or worse . Not that way , Farley . For you , Mr. West , I have other things in mind . I think I 've drawn your fangs , Mr. West . This is my headquarters and my home . Looks more like a warehouse . 11 years ago when I had my eyes , I might have said the same thing . An explosion took away my sight and my livelihood . I was the finest pilot on the Mississippi . I still am . You 'd be amazed how blindness sharpens the other faculties . Everything here is for the pleasure of my senses . Smell . Touch . Hearing . And this is my greatest treasure . The one I prize above all the others . Oriana , my wife . Are you afraid of him now ? She has a premonition about you , Mr. West , but presently , I will give her final , positive proof that you can no longer harm me . Exquisite , isn 't she ? One of the loveliest women I 've ever seen . Praise from a connoisseur . You must thank him , Oriana . Go ahead . You are very kind , Mr. West . A Chinese potter always deliberately flaws his work to avoid ... perfection . Her voice is Oriana 's flaw . A flatboat is leaving Natchez . How do you know that ? One of my eyes has seen it . Come here . From one end of the river to the other , I have 1,000 agents - my eyes . Nothing moves on the river , even a small , unimportant flatboat , that I don 't know about . From hour to hour , I know the whereabouts of every vessel . And you destroy them - how ? There are critical points where a pilot lays his course according to landmarks - a tree , a rock , a steeple . We provide alternate landmarks . And the ships wind up on the shoals . Exactly - to be looted , dismantled , burned . To vanish . A month ago , there were 100 vessels here . Now only two , and a flatboat . No question it 's been most profitable . Gleanings , gleanings . Tomorrow I will send a message to the President of the United States demanding a tribute . One cent for every pound of cargo that I permit to move freely along the river . Impossible ; you 'll never get away with it . Your voice betrays you . You 're not at all sure it 's impossible . What 's to stop me ? In a year , I 'll be the richest man in history . It 's nearly time . Dooley ! To the cage . The storm 's upon us , Mr. West . If you look behind you , you 'll see there 's a lightning rod attached to your cage . Already , the very ground is charged with electrical fluid . The air tingles with it . You will be electrocuted . Where are they ? Who , sir ? The girl and the man . You 'll have to be more explicit , sir . What girl and what man ? Jennifer Wingate - she is a girl . And Jim West - he 's a man . And don 't " sir " me . Talk . Well , sir , I mean , they did dine , sir , and then Miss Wingate had to leave hurriedly to visit a sick uncle , and the gentleman went on about his way . That sick uncle wouldn 't happen to be a man named Coffin , now , would it ? " Coffin " is a casket , sir . A box in which one is usually buried . Thank you very much . Jim ? Forget him , mate . Uh , you say forget him ? May I ask what you mean by that ? What I said - forget him , mate . Ah . You must know something that , uh , I don 't . Yeah , like you 're going to join him real soon , mate . I see . And , uh , you gentlemen are going to escort me there ? That 's right , we 're going to take you , right , Lug ? Right , Mike . Well , if it 's going to be a long journey , I 'm sure you won 't mind if I , uh ... Oh , no . We 'll even go in with you , won 't we , Lug ? Right . Well , thank you , thank you . Ah , drowning 's much cleaner . Yes , gentlemen , it 's always been an old tradition of the family among my ancestors . Almost a , uh , motto of the clan , if you will . Never take a long journey unless well bathed . One never knows whom one may meet along the way , and as my father always said to me , " One should always look his best , Artemus . " Ha-ha-ha ! You 're the jolly pirate . And you 're daft , mate . Go ahead and enjoy yourself . Hold that for me , will you ? Thank you very much . Hey , take the Greeks and the Romans , for instance , eh ? Why , they were known for their baths . All our modern plumbing comes right from their culture . That goes back centuries . Thank you very much . You , uh ... have heard of baths , haven 't you ? Not me , mate . They rust the bones . Oh , not at all . They 're wonderful . Why , take soap , for instance . It 's a magnificent invention . Absolutely evaporates the dirt , tingles the skin , gives one a deep sense of purity . Soap , soap , beautiful , beautiful soap . Thank you very much . I tell you , gentlemen , baths are probably the best things that one can ever take . You ought to try it sometime . You too , Mike . You . $ 100 if you tell me where I can find my friend . Sure . Where is he ? He 's where nobody can do him any good . By now , he 's in the river , dead . Ansel ? Yes , Oriana ? I have never questioned your wisdom . But now ? Release Mr. West . Oriana , soon now ... the whole river will be mine . Ansel ... can we leave here ? Go away . Live in peace ? Just when I have them at my feet ? I don 't want the river to be your grave . The river will be my throne . Our throne . I 'll give you the whole world for a kingdom . I do not want a whole world . I want you . Alive . I want you alive . I only want to share your love . You already have all my love , Oriana . That can never be lost . I 'm afraid that if you kill Mr. West ... you 'll kill us , too . I was very fortunate that night the boat blew up and I lost my sight because you were aboard . You found me on the deck , you stayed with me . You became my eyes . You are my life . Do you think I would let anything or anybody take you away from me ? Take us away from each other ? I would rather die . But I am afraid . Do not be afraid of a dead man ! The dead cannot hurt . Something wrong with your eyes , Mr. West ? Your powder flash blinded me . Very good , Mr. West . But not nearly good enough . You will have to practice for 11 years in the dark - the darkness of your skull ! - to compete with me . There are weapons all around you , Mr. West . Guns ... knives ... rifles . There . You catch on quickly , Mr. West . It will only slightly prolong your life . Don 't make a sound , Oriana . I have an ingenious weapon for your demise ... Mr. West ! Ansel ! Oriana ? Oriana ! Oh ... Ansel . Oriana . I 'm sorry , but under the circumstances life imprisonment is almost mandatory . Surely you must have some influence with the judge . Mmm , mmm , under the circumstances , my recommendation might do some good . I 've already promised I will never again do any of those evil things . Artemus , do you believe her ? I certainly do not . How can you say that ? Easily . I can 't understand it , Jim . How can you sit there and let yourself be stung by the kiss of death ? No , no , Artemus . No , no , no , really . For three days and nights , I 've been tramping up and down that river without sleep . Certain that , at the next bend , I 'd find you floating somewhere , face down in the water . I get jumped on by two men and nearly drowned myself in a bathtub ! And you say , " No , no , no , Artemus . No , no . " Artemus , why should you complain ? Coffin put me into a cage and tried to electrocute me . And she ... she tried to shoot me . And ... at close range . Aah . So , I was wrong , darlings . But there must be some forgiveness in your hearts . Life ? Ten years . Five . And of course , time off for good behavior . Jim ... I am simply appalled . How can you even consider leniency at a time like this ? This woman tried to kill you . She tried to kill both of us . I 've turned over a new leaf . That must count for something . Besides , do we know how many other monstrous crimes she may have committed ? Mmm ... W-Well , on the other hand , I mean , there 's no need to be vindictive , either , you know . Poor little thing .

 EUROSEC European Space Exploration Complex Portugal , Gate 7 . Good evening , Sergeant . Good evening , Dr. Hassler . File 7842 . Authority , please . Thank you . Your pen , Dr. Hassler . Sorry , Sergeant . Oh , well , now my plan is ruined . See , it is not a pen at all , it is a secret camera . A better luck next time , Doctor . Vault nine . Thank you , Sergeant . Now , we shall see . EUROSEC-OPERATION SUN PROBE TOP SECURITY My mistake . You were right . - I am sorry . - That 's all right , doctor . All right . EUROSEC-OPERATION SUN PROBE TOP SECRET FURTHER DATA FROM ON BOARD INSTRUMENTATION AWAITING PROCESSING JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN SYSTEM - - BASIC NEW FILE NAME SUNPROBE . WAIT . READY RUN OPERATION SUN PROBE - Cigar ? - Isn 't it a little premature ? You didn 't won yet . - Do you wonna bet ? - Yeah . 3 thousand million pounds . - All right ? - Everything 's fine . One minute to go . Last as usual ... NASA LIAISON . He 's only got a hundred yards to walk . Security , Lisa . Scrambling 's operative . Gentlemen , gentlemen , please . The 67-th meeting of the European Space Exploration Counsel is now in session . This is a momentous occasion for our organization . Sun Probe 1 was an unqualified success . We have some spectacular results . However , this meeting is coiled considering one single result , startling in its implications . Dr. John Kane , the project Director . Gentlemen , an unmanned satellite is naturally limited in the transmission of information . Part of the Sun Probe 's equipment was a cine camera , set to take one picture a minute for the duration of the flight . Roll the film , please . The far side of the Sun , over 100 million miles from Earth , hidden from the eyes of radiotelescopes by the Sun itself . Now , at this point of the flight a strange thing happened . The gyro mechanisms aboard were influenced by another magnetic field and the capsule slowly started to rotate . Now , if you watch your screens carefully , you will see , that the capsule 's sunny camera was panned of the Sun to watch the force , that was attracting it . That force , gentlemen , was the gravitational pull of another planet . Now I am going to hold the film here to show you the first complete photographic evidende for the new planet . Hold and zoom . A new planet in our Solar system . Thank you . Photographic evidence is only part of the story . Instruments aboard capsule report , that it is in the same orbit , as Earth , but directly on the opposite side of the Sun . Orbital speed , precisely the same as ours , is the reason , that it remained undetected . What information do we have from the other systems on board ? Not enough . Which brings me to the purpose of this meeting . A proposal from the Chair , that we should mount a manned flight to the new planet . Lisa , book me a scrambled satellite call to the NASA Headquarter at the end of this meeting , please . - It is allready in hand , David . - How come ? Instructions from Jason Webb . Oh . Thanks . Now , Jason , how much is it going to cost us this time ? A point of order , Mr. Chairman . Another one ? Mr. Chairman will agree , will he not , that all delegates are entitled to share the EUROSEC information . Correct ! Then , perhaps , the Chairman will share with us the estimative costs of this manned expedition . A realistic estimate , Gentlemen , 3 thousand million pounds sterling . Mr. Chairman , I am sure , I am speaking for the whole of the community , when I say , that such a sum is out of the question . Trust a German to louse it up ! They lecture us on penny-pinching economics . The French are only too glad to agree with them . The rest of the Comunity goes wichever way the wind blows . America is our only hope . - If they contribute , the rest might follow . - Oh , face it , Jason , we 've had it . Had what ? This is only a temporary setback ! Did you see the the Poulson 's face , when you pitched the price ? - No , I didn 't . - Well I did , and he 's not gonna buy it . - He 'll buy it ! - Oh , for God 's sake ! - Yes ? - David Poulson on the internal . Are you free to see him ? - Send him right up . - Yes , sir . You 're gonna sit there and watch me take command for 1 billion dollars . The words of an egocentrical megalomaniac . Maniac ? Remind me to be as charitable to you , when one of your rockets blows up on the pad . And you better attend that cardiac warning . Just a minute . I will make a deal with you . You stick to the science , let me handle the politics . I will accept that deal . I will stick to the science , if you handle the politics . Hello , John . Hi , Jason . How are you , David ? Some scotch ? Thanks . Hope you don 't mind if I do . Straight . All right . Now , why don 't you give it to me , straight ? Well , as you know , the United States has always cooperated with EUROSEC . - But in this case we feel ... - I said straight ! O 'k , Jason , It 's " no go " . We discover a new planet in our own Solar system . Military and scientific implications beyond comprehension . We ask our friends for a few dollars . And it 's " no go " . One billion dollars , Jason . Cheap at twice the price . - Are you sure about this ? - Yes . Give it to Jason tonight . Delay could be dangerous . Oh , no , thanks . You wouldn 't want anybody else get there first , could you ? But how could they ? When we have sole access to the information . Who else would know of the planet 's existence ? You know perfectly well , that we have a security leak . Well , we all have our problems . I see . I get the message . I know how you feel about this project , Jason . But the answer ist " no " . I am sorry , I really am . So am I. Miss Kurby ! I am going home now . Tell Newman and Lisa , I want to see them at 7 : 30 . Yes , Mr. Webb . Oh , and ... John Kane asked me to give you this . Sorry , Jason , but I am through . John . Come in ! I want a run-down on the current security position . - Deffensively ? - H-m-m-m . We haused all findings , computer programs and visual data from Sun Probe 1 in Vault 2 . Access ? - Restricted ! - To whom ? Yourself , John Kane and Mark . And offensively ? I 've already reported the near certainty of a security leak , especially ... And so ? We picked up a radio signal again this morning . - I am gonna burry him . - Why not a fake ? Listen , Jason , that information is coded and radioed out in a 2-seconds transmission . And there are 86,400 seconds in a day . All right . You made your point . - But when are you gonna nail him ? - What ? When are you going to nail him ? Depends on how much rope we 'll give him . All right . Lisa , that access restriction must be widened . To whom ? Hassler . Dr. Hassler . You are serving the information on a plate to our prime suspect ? That is my responsibility . Your responsibility is this : If he shows his hand , I don 't want an arrest . Undestood ? Undestood . Has any of this information been transmitted ? He certainly wasn 't broadcasting record requests . So by now , the existence of the new planet could be known outside Europe and the States . I am afraid so . And preparation for a manned flight should be under way by somebody else . Don 't panic . It would take some time . Yes , we have to check out your information , to examine Hassler 's body , to see the transmissions you monitored , to check the manufacturing origins of this photographic equipment . Arrange all that for Mr. Poulson immediately . And put John Kane in the picture . Right . Oh , can I have a look at the photographic equipment ? Sure . Does our side have anything like this ? We have now . Oh , Mark ... Give that back to Kane , will you ? Tell him ... I accept his apologies . Right . So , you are convinced now there have been a leak . Yes . And I am left with no choice . I agree . But it 's up to you to persuade the rest of the Community . But you be prepared to recommend , that the United States should contribute 1 billion dollars to a manned flight conducted by EUROSEC . Yes . Full information share . Guaranteed . By you ? What else do you suggest ? Putting an American astronaut on the team . Who ? I have already called Cape Kennedy . They 've come up with our most experienced . 50 days of space flight , 2 manned projects to Mars ... Glenn Ross ? The passengers from NASA flight 155 will arrive at Gate seven . Thank you . Hold it , Mrs Ross ! Thank you , Colonel . I am Jason Webb . Welcome to EUROSEC ! Glenn Ross . My wife Sharon . - How do you do ? - Hello ! This is Lisa Hartman , security . - How do you do ? - Hello ! - Miss Hartman . - Nice to meet you . - Dr. Kane , our Project Director . - How do you do ? - Delighted to meet you . - Me too . Paulo Landi , public relations . He will be lookng after both of you . - How do you do , Missis Ross ? - Hello ! - Would you like me to bring you a drink ? - A scotch , please . - What 's on your mind ? - I have been thinking , John about the second astronaut of Captain Ross . Now , Baldwin is the obvious choice . Or Mitchell ... If we want just an astronaut , I agree . - But ? - It occurs to me , that we need someone more flexible . - But I trained them ... - I mean in terms of knowledge . Someone who could take full advantage of any findings on the new planet . However bizarre and unusual they happen to be . You mean an astrophysicist ? Me ? Yeah . The idea doesn 't appeal to you ? - You must be joking . - ' t 'll grow on you . Well , there she is . Watch the gantry . We have been developing a lift body for controlled landings . If analysis confirms an atmosphere on the new planet , we 'll use that as a last stage . Without seeming too eager , when does the training start ? Tomorrow . I can hardly wait . 400 . 400 . 450 . 500 . 600 . 650 . 700 . 700 . - Fire retros ! - Hold it ! - 750 . - Jason ! 800 ! What are you trying to do ? Kill him ? 800 ! - 850 ! - Now ! - Retros ! No ! Are you o 'k , John ? O 'k . Yes , I am o 'k . Hi ! I didn 't know you would be back . - You are late . - We ... drove to Lisbon to see the Cathedral , and then stopped over for dinner . Oh , I could sleep for a week ! I had my first medical today . Did you ? How did it go ? The doctors say everything 's alright , as usual . Good . Everything is all right . We are not starting that one again , are we ? Look , face it , Glenn , it is your job . You 're up in space hundreds of days , you are subjected to radiation effects and that is why we can 't have children . The doctors said differend . They were employed by politicians . Do you really think they 'd tell you even the truth ? Great publicity . America 's top astronaut ... sterile . Your doctors don 't work for politicians so we know it is not you . For God 's sake , I am not about to go trough this again ! The brutal truth of the matter is that you went up there a man , but you came less than a man . May be this is why we are not having kids , huh ? If you have anything to say , you better say it now . It 'so how you prove your virility ! ? It really was the only way of attracting your attention . You look like a man with problems . Yeah , I 'll tell you about them some day . Thank you . Would Mister Edwards , please contact reception ? We don 't often see you at the administration . Jason wants to see me . How is the training going ? It 's tough enough for me , but it 's hard for John . So it 's crash course of space preparation . Glenn ... There is something I shouldn 't tell you . What 's that ? - I know why Jason wants to see you . - Why ? He plans to put the launch date forward . - Forward ? - Hmm . Well , we 'll see about that . Good luck , Glenn . - Lisa ... - Hmm ? Thanks for the warning . I am forwarding the launching day four weeks . You are pushing too hard , Jason . You don 't understand . In Germany budgetary troubles , in France political troubles ... Someone is going to suggest withdrawing from the project , any day . You are an administrator , you know when a rocket 's ready , but you don 't know when a man is ready . Kane isn 't . I know more about human nature than anybody else at EUROSEC . That 's why I am in this office . And I am telling you , Kane will make it . And I am telling you he won 't . Where do we go from here ? There are other American astronauts ... That 's right . You 'd be right back to zero again . Nevertheless , I am informing you officially , that the launching day will be brought forward ... two weeks . Two weeks . Now ? Now . My instincts tell me , there is a little bit of transportation around here somewhere . Don 't the rule say we walk ? Sure . What is it like up there ? - Where ? - There . Lonely . How lonely ? Same as down here , no difference . You mean , you have got someone with you down here , up there ? Yes . It has to be the right person . Otherways makes no difference . No difference . - Home again . - Yeah . This is the part we have to make look good , we are back uncomfortably early . I could grow attached to them . That 's the idea . Now you could be hooked up to the heart , lung and kidney machine during the flight . With sedation , you will sleep ... for tree weeks there ... and tree weeks back . That part I 'm looking forward to . - UEROSEC Launch Control . - Dock one in stand by . Dock two : operational . Four down . Clean ejectors . Procedures check . I have three greens . All go . Roger .

You can see how they imagined at that time the dream of the medicals - a direct continuous venous approach for infusions . Nowadays there are already avaiable implantable port-a-cath systems for chemotherapy and infusions for oncological and other patients . See you in three weeks . Let us hope the alarm clock goes off . Better . You made it . Good morning . Bang on target . Clouds . There are clouds , Glenn ! So , there is an atmosphere . All right . Preliminary orbit : 34 thousand miles from the planet 's surface 's plane , right ? Right . O 'k , two orbits to mark out electronic survey and we decide ... To land or not to land ? Well , let 's have it . Mass and gravitational pull : similar to Earth , there is an atmosphere , oxygen present . Suitable landing site ? Established . Seascape and vegetation , so far no sign of life . All right , mate . What 's the next move ? Well , like you said : to land or not to land . Well , this is one we can 't put through the computer . What do you think ? I think , on the result of the survay , we don 't have a choice . - You ? - I am for go . Let 's go , then . Landing orbit , coming up . EXPLOSIVES Cabin pressure : zero . Ready for transfer to the landing lift body . - 30 seconds . - O 'k . The on board computer should take us within 5 miles from the selected landing site . - 10 seconds . - Right . If we have any trouble with the guiding system , give me manual straight away . Check . There we go . Computer checks , main retros : 5 seconds . Roger . Tree , two , one ... Time check ? Three minutes to manual , four minutes to touch-down . Manual ! Give me manual ! Landing lights . Vertical jets , full flaps . Do you speak English ? I am Air-Sea Rescue . Ulan Bator . I will get your friend . - Well ? - The results of the electronic medical check ... He is in a pretty good shape . But the readouts of the items 20 , 27 and 32 don 't make sense . They certainly don 't . Check the computer . - It was checked out this morning . - Then check it out again ! Never trust them . - Any improvement ? - No . Has he spoken ? Desjointedly . It 's impossible to make out a meaning . Arrange for everything he says to be recorded . Mark , I want a total security black-out on news of their return . Till we find out what the devil has gone wrong ! What about that Mongolian rescue team ? I have already called my opposite number in the Soviet Academy of Space Science . They agreed to cooperate . Does the clamp-down include Missis Ross ? No , tell her to stand by . Pontini ! No one , except authorized personel , has to see any of the results , till all of the computers have been completely rechecked . You are responsible . It 's my department . Well ? - Dr. Kane is still unconscious ... - And Colonel Ross ? Apart of the shock and the surperficial burning , - located in ... - Is he fit ? I don 't want details . I want to know one thing : - Is he fit questioning ? - Yes . Do I have to go through with this ? It 's your job . Before we get started , this is an interrogation room , not a debriefing center . That 's right . Sit down , please . Why did you turn back ? We did not turn back . You continue to claim that you completed your mission ? We reached the new planet . Yes . You agree that the flight to the planet and return is a journey of six weeks ? - Yes . - You accept that you have in fact returned three weeks after launching ? All right , I ... can 't exlplain that . What I can say is that ... You completed the electronic survey ? Yes . On the new planet ? - Yes . - And returned to Earth ? We crashed ! On Earth ! ? On the planet ! You are here ... ... on Earth ! To the planet and back in three weeks ? I don 't know . There is a lot I can 't explain . You left Earth . Three weeks later you returned . Crashed . It takes six weeks to travel to the new planet and return . You were gone three weeks . So , you turned back ! - We did not turned back ! - Why ? Why ? WHY ? I am sending Ross home . You won 't get any more out of him today . The interrogation leaves us with two possibilities : One : Ross aborted the mission and turned back . If that was the case , he would deny for obvious reasons . Two : Ross genuinely believes he made the journey to the new planet . And he is as surprised as we are , that when he landed , he found himself back on Earth . This is the theory I prefer to believe . Only one snag : Why was there " no sign of life " on his electronic survey ? But that could be explained . The orbit took them over the Pacific , the Atlantic and the Poles . The few land masses they crossed are mainly uninhabited . All right . So we prefer the second theory . But ... three weeks to the planet ... three weeks back , that 's six weeks in all . - They were only away three weeks . - That 's right . So ... they turned back . It still doesn 't make sense . The world 's most experienced astronaut ... and the leading scientist ... Why ? The Council felt railroaded into this project from the start . They 'll turn like a pack of wolves , when they know that it has failed . They don 't know yet . And they won 't know , until I establish exactly what happened . You can 't do that without the flight recorder . And it 's still on the Phoenix . Arrangements must be made to bring that back . When is Poulson due back from the States ? Not till the 17th . Thank God for that ! Was it rough ? Yeah . Glenn , what really happened ? What do you mean ? What made you turn back ? We didn 't turn back . Then it doesn 't make sense . Right . You are covering for John Kane , aren 't you ? No . There ist nothing to cover for . Look out ! What the hell are you doing ? He was on the wrong side of the road . It must have been rough . I 'll go make some coffee . Sharon , what 's going on ? Sharon ! - What is it , Glenn ? - You know damn well what it is . This rom . - What about the room ? - It 's changed ! Everything is changed ! What the hell 's happened here ? Well , some desorientation isn 't unusual , after a protracted period in space . I undersand that , but it has never happened after the previous space flights . All right . Keep me informed . If the things get worse , I promise immediate action . Fresh Appeal Cologne What is it ? What 's wrong ? The wrighting is reversed . Everything is reversed ! Jason Webb , please . Jason , this is urgent . I must see you right away . Excuse me , Colonel . - Yeah , what is it ? - Over here , Colonel ! What the hell is this all about ? Do what they say , Glenn . - He called me . - From where ? From the bathroom in here . See for yourself . He shouldn 't have been send home . He could have killed me . This does it . I am getting out of here . You don 't mean that , Sharon ! You bet I do . What happened after he smashed off the bottles ? He went crazy . He sayd his own handwrighting was reversed , my watch everything . Look at this . Does this look reversed to you ? This man has got out of his mind . We don 't know that yet . Well , you may not , but I do . I am his wife , remember that . He has been violent before . Like this ? He hit me . - It was that flight . - It was before the flight . And , like I said , I am getting out of here . We know about your personal life , Mrs. Ross . It 's our job . But you better forget this idea about leaving . You can 't stop me . I can 't stop you leaving this house . But I can and I will stop you leaving EUROSEC . You can talk to him now . So ... Everything is reversed , huh ? - Everything . - But , Glenn , ... we are going to check a few things . All right . Set it up . Now , watch the mirror , please . Thank you . Read it ! Fire emergency check list : In event of fire priorities are assigned as follows : First-Documentation , Second-Research specimens , Thirth - Photographic material , Fourth - Progress report ... All right . Good enough for you ? What the hell more do you want ? I don 't envy him . You completed your mission ? Why did you turn back ? We crashed ! Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? WHY ? WHY ? You completed your mission ? Why did you turn back ? We crashed ! Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? WHY ? WHY ? Satisfied ? Satisfied ? Satisfied , that I was telling the truth about the new planet . You are bound to be a little confused , until the drug wears off . - You are trying to check up my story , right ? - Yeah . You couldn 't fault it , right ? - No , we coludn 't fault it . - Right . You will hear the same story from John Kane . What happened ? Tell me ! I am sorry I am late . I was detained at the medical centre . Come and sit down . What I have to say to you , is very important . No , Jason , you sit down . You checked me , interrogated me , you have looked in to my brain and you found out nothing . I want you to sit down and listen to me . I am listening . Now , what I am going to tell you , is bizarre , weird . But it 's the only theory , that fits the facts . I propose a complete duplication of matter . A situation , where every single atom , every molecule here is duplicated here . Except that it is in reverse . Then , when I left Earth to travel to the new planet , another man left the new planet , at precisely the same time to travel to Earth . Another Colonel Ross . The man you know as Colonel Ross , is on the other planet , standing in an identical , except reversed , room , talking to an identical Jason Webb , who is sitting in an identical chair , rubbing his hands together in this exact moment . Look here . Now , what do you see ? Go on . You see the mirrored images of Jason Webb and Glenn Ross . There are four people in this room . Two Jason Webbs , two Glenn Rosses . What I am trying to say is , this two planets have a physical connection . One is the mirrored image of the other . But unlike the reflection in the mirror , they both exist . For every person on one planet there is a double on the other . Don 't you understand ? Until a few days ago you and I have never met . Are you trying to tell me , that you don 't know any of the people here ? Your wife ? Lisa , Newman ? Only their Doppelgängers . ( from German : mythology , folklore , literature ( romanticism ) : evil twin , astral body , bilocation phenomenon or disastrous prophesy . ) - Dopp ... What ? - Doppelgängers . Doubles . ( Literature : Gilgamesh , E.T.A. Hoffmann , Sheley , Dostoyevsky , Andersen , Hawthorn , Salvatore , R. L. Stevenson , J. Conrad etc . ) In a literal translation , the mirrored imaghes of themselves . ( Movie : David Linch - Tween Peaks , Stanley Kubrik-Eyes Wide Shut etc . ) I better get you a drink . All right , I know how it sounds . Could you think of anything better ? I wish to God I could . When I got your call , - Dr. Pontini had just completed the post-mortem of John Kane . - And ? Kane 's internal organs were found to be on the oposite side from normal . My normal , that is . It was all there , on the computer readouts , when you had your electronic medicals , I assumed wrongly , that it was a fault . Lesson number one : never distrust a computer . So you see your theory holds up . It would seem I am not that Jason Webb , that you know . Only ... an impish Doppelgänger . How do you do , Coronel Ross ? - It 's only a theory . - But it 's the best that you could come up with . But we can 't prove it , till we recover the Phoenix . And what if we are right ? You realize , that your version of the " Dove " would not be able to dock with the Phoenix . We 'll have to reverse the controls and the electrical systems . Or does the polarity of the electricity remain the same ? Well ? Does it ? If we are wrong you do realize what would happen to you ? Chance I am willing to take . And the other Colonel Ross ? Are you willing to take the chance on him too ? That was a penny for your toughts . If they are as confused as mine , maybe sharing them would help ? Did you say a penny ? Well , it 's a buyers ' market . What would you like to know ? - Sharon has left ? - Yes . In a way , she left a long time ago . - Are you going to recover the Phoenix ? - Yes . With reversed vision , how will you operate the controls ? Eh , it should be interesting . Don 't do it , Glenn . You have done enough for Jason . Well , it 's not really just for Jason . I don 't understand ? Well , you know how it is , there is so much I am not supposed to talk about . Do you mind me coming over ? No , as a matter of fact , I am glad you are here . Someone to talk to . Why did you reverse DOPPELGÄNGER , Coronel ? It 's an inside joke between me and myself . - Good luck , Sir . - Thank you . - Network check completed ? - All set . Proceed condition . Proceed condition . This is EUROSEC launch control . Phoenix on horizon . Lift-off eight seconds . Roger , Control . On board computer indicates lift-off five seconds . Four , three , two , one ... Report on ground systems . Procedures check : All systems go . Roger . You couldn 't stay away , hm ? Launch control , this is Doppelgänger . Airspeed : 12,500 . Roger , Doppelgänger . Countdown for second stage : 10 seconds . 5 seconds . four , three , two , one ... Control , this is Doppelgänger . Now leaving the Earth 's atmosphere . Roger , Doppelgänger .

Doppelgänger , this is EUROSEC Launch control . Computer reports Phoenix 20 miles ahead . Your orbital position is correct for automatic approach to EUROSEC , should there be an emergency condition . Thank you , Control . I see it now . See it now , Control . Beginning docking manoeuvers . From now on it will be just as easy , as ... parking a car . For a man with reversed vision ? To Launch control from Doppelgänger , is Jason Webb there ? Jason Webb here . About to dock , Jason . Any additional orders ? Proceed with docking . - Roger . Rolls Royce E.S.V. = Earth Station on board Vessel REACTOR Reactor Cooling System To Launch Control from Doppelgänger , Jason , we were right ... There are two planets . There are definitely two identic ... Doppelgänger , say again , we lost your last trans ... Jason , I 'm not reading ... I repeat , we lost your last transmission . Jason , I 'm not reading you , may be you 're reading me . The retros on the Phoenix have fired , I don 't know why , but they 've fired . I am pulling out . I say again , there are definitely two planets . Identical , but reversed in some way . Launch colntrol , if you are reading me , come in , please . Give him the automatic approach system . " Dove " now on automatic control . Roger . Yellow condition ! All stations , stand by ! This is Doppelgänger to Launch control , if you are reading me , come in , please . I pulled out of the Phoenix , extensive damages of all systems . One thing is not reversed : it 's the polarity of electricity . Instruments indicate : negative is still negative , positive is still positive . Phoenix re-entry . Is there a separate reading for " Dove " ? No , sir . Re-entry speed ? Speed : 19,000 reducing . Second bleep on screen . - Could be the " Dove " . - Speed ? Stand by . Speed : 12,000 reducing . Controlled re-entry ? As far as I can see , sir . Angle of entry : fair . Launch control , cut automatic approach system ! I say again , cut automatic approach system ! Unable to affect landing at EUROSEC . All vertical thrust is a ... Maintain automatic approach system .

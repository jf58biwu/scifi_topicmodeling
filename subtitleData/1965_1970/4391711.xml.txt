 David Vincent ? Yes . Mike Calvin . Hi . You made good time . Well , Scoville let me use his plane . Is this the ship that saw the collision ? That 's it . What do you think ? You read my article in the Chronicle ? Yeah . " Meteorite collides with weather satellite . " Well , that 's the air force opinion . I did it from their angle . What do you think ? I don 't know . Reports of flying saucers in that area , UFOs ... A meteor could have clobbered that satellite but ... I don 't know . Well , let 's have a look . Think you were followed ? Well , if there 's evidence of alien spacecraft aboard , they 'll be after it , too . You from the Chronicle ? Yeah . Your captain said we might look at the stuff . Do a follow-up story . Help yourself- - number three hold . Couple of large crates . DAVID : Say- - did you see the collision ? I 'm not even sure it was a collision . All I know is something started raining junk . What kind of junk ? Oh , pieces of metal , tubing , wire . That all ? That 's all . Look , I 'm going ashore for a beer . Nobody 'll bother you . What about the crew ? I checked . Most of them are ashore . Hold it . All right , let 's go . Mike ? See anything ? Nothing but sacks and barrels . What time did the ship dock ? 10 : 00 this morning . Well , that 's over five hours ago . They could have beaten us to it . David , if the aliens took it , I was right- - that wreckage was important to them . Looking for something ? Don 't reach anywhere but up . Get their guns . Run , Mike ! Hold it ! NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here , that they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : J.D. Cannon . Chris Robinson . Larry Gates . Kent Smith . Roy Poole . NARRATOR : A search for evidence of an alien spacecraft has led David Vincent into the hands of a ruthless enemy , unaware that the freighter he searched carried not one alien cargo , but two . ( phone dialing ) It wasn 't there . We did look . It just wasn 't there . That 's right , number three hold . We sure did- - two of them . No , one of them got away . Vincent . David Vincent . Yes , sir . He 's on his way . All right , Vincent . Let 's start all over again . Who told you about the shipment ? How 'd you know where to find it ? And where 's your partner ? He got away . We 'll find him . You 'll tell us where . What happened ? We blew it . The wreckage wasn 't there . But they were ? Right . How far 'd you tail them ? From the docks to the river , about a mile east of here . And that 's where you lost them ? Yeah . All right . You start right here and work your way back . I 'll head west as far as Pinewood . That 's four miles . I 'll take the guards with me . We 'll split up to cover it . There 's a phone in my car . If you find David , call me . I will if I can . Well , Mr. Vincent , you 've had a difficult time of it . I 'm sorry . But you did bring it on yourself . Wait outside . You know , Mr. Vincent , I left a very spectacular cocktail party just to come here and meet you . ( door closes ) My name 's Kalter ... Peter Kalter . What are you going to do with me ? What happens to you is entirely your decision . Now ... where do we find your partner ? He , uh ... has something that belongs to us . All he got away with was his life . You know , your loyalty is almost poetic . When you consider the consequences of it . The consequences are mine , right ? I 've nothing to say . This was your first job , wasn 't it ? If you were experienced , you 'd never hijack something you can 't possibly handle . Why not ? Because it takes an organization like ours to get that much stuff cut and distributed . I didn 't know anything about your shipment when I went aboard that freighter . I 'm not a naive man , Mr. Vincent . I 'm no hijacker . Then what were you doing in that cargo hold ? Looking for something else . For what ? Pieces of metal ... electrical parts . Look , there were several crates in that hold . Maybe yours was taken with the one I wanted . You 're lying . They took your drugs by mistake . They ? Who , Mr. Vincent ? Who are they ? A group . A group ? What kind of group ? Who are they ? Where do I find them ? You can 't . You know who I am ? Not even your organization can reach them . We have a very long arm , Mr. Vincent . Now , who are they ? ( whistles ) KALTER : He 's stalling . All right , I 'll tell you . Your life ... depends on whether I believe what you tell me . ( gun cocking ) Invaders from space ! ( laughing ) A man faced with dying should be able to offer a more plausible story in his defense . A man faced with dying doesn 't lie . That can be your epitaph . Mike . Sorry , David . You gave me a chance , but I had to come back for you . I found him prowling around with this . Yeah . He 's the one who got away . You still expect me to believe your story about creatures from space ? Look around outside . David , who are these people ? Hoods . I don 't like that word , Mr. Vincent . Now , where 's our shipment ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'm talking about life and death- - yours . KALTER : Now , where is it ? He 's telling the truth . He doesn 't know . Well , it 's getting late , and I want to get back to my cocktail party . I don 't think there 's any reason to keep them alive . Circle the town again . If we strike out this time , we 'll head back toward the river . KALTER : That one first , Perry . He doesn 't know anything . You mean he hasn 't admitted anything . Your last chance . KALTER : Where 's our shipment ? ( gun cocking ) KALTER : You 're next , friend . Where is it ? Be ready . All right , let him up . KALTER : Bring him inside , let him go . If you were stupid enough to take our shipment , you wouldn 't be stupid enough to die for it . Let them go . Scoville ? Edgar Scoville ? KALTER : An unexpected pleasure . David , Mike , you all right ? Yeah . What is this ? Are they friends of yours ? They are . I didn 't know that . That change anything ? Of course it would . I know Edgar Scoville . Even if he wishes he didn 't know me . This , uh ... story of Vincent 's ... do you believe that ? We 're working together . Why don 't you tell me what this is about ? Maybe I can give you a hand . No , thanks . Hold it , Scoville . Who do you think you 're talking to ? I could 've hurt these friends of yours if I were what you think I am . You are . Just how could you help us ? If I believed you ? I don 't know . A lot of ways . I have a big organization . Some connections . Not interested . David . Mike . You 're not thinking of tying up with guys like that , Mr. Kalter ? Of course not . They 're crazy . Of course . They 'd have to be . What did they want with you ? They were bringing in narcotics . They thought we took their shipment . I 'm amazed he didn 't kill you . Peter Kalter 's the worst kind of gangster there is . For a while , I thought he was going to kill me . What do you imagine he could do for us if he were on our side ? Kill a lot of people . Some of the aliens , some of us if he felt like it . But he 's not on our side . We 've got all we could do fighting one war at a time . You basing that on newspaper accounts ? Fellow named Harold Beale- - he used to supply nuts and bolts to a few plants in the Northeast , including mine- - wanted to testify against him . Kalter had bombed his factory because he couldn 't get 50 percent for free . They 're still dragging the Hudson River for Harold Beale . I met him myself last year . A member put him up for the Uptown Athletic Club . I blackballed him . The member thought I wasn 't being fair . Brought him around so we could see what a prince he was . Everybody else was for taking him in . I blackballed him again- - one 's all it takes- - and then resigned from the Uptown Athletic Club . Peter Kalter doesn 't like me and I don 't like Peter Kalter . And I don 't like what you 're thinking , David . Come round to my office first thing in the morning . I want to show you a letter Harold 's wife sent me when he couldn 't deliver some parts on time ... because somebody broke both his arms . We have obligations , Pete , to the suppliers , the wholesalers , the distributors and to the users . It isn 't right to promise and not deliver . No , I ... know it isn 't , Mr. Weller . How soon can you recover the shipment ? I don 't know . To be honest with you , I 've reached a sort of dead end . We 're , uh ... We 're talking about , uh ... ten , 11 , 12 million dollars . I think you should make another try . Yes , sir . Of course . David Vincent and his associates- - could they help you ? I don 't think they 're any closer to it than we are . Well , they do have some story about who has it . Mr. Weller , Vincent 's in with some tough people . A reporter , a man named Scoville who 's a millionaire ... They 're , uh ... hard to push around . Are they ? Really ? I have a bad feeling . I don 't like Vincent or Scoville . I 'm not sure we can trust them . Maybe other solutions will present themselves . I think you can handle them . I 'll try . Good . Thank you , Pete . Call David Vincent for me . Ask if I can see him . She sounds like a fine woman . She is , and her husband was a fine man . Well , I agree with you , Edgar . Kalter deserves everything you said about him . But ... what ? He has an organization . Hundreds of connections all over town who can help us find what we 're looking for . Now , what 's our first responsibility to fight people like Kalter or aliens ? Aliens ... but that doesn 't mean we have to use Kalter . We know the aliens have his narcotics , and he has the manpower to get them back . And maybe the crates containing the saucer fragments . I think we should give it a try . No . He can help us get the crates back and maybe uncover some good evidence . No ! Look , Edgar , if it doesn 't work out , we can forget it ever happened . But it will have happened . He 'll get his narcotics back and you 'll know too much . They 'll never let you out . No . We all know the morality of it . When is it all right to fight fire with fire ? But what really worries me is , you 'll get into this thing and you 'll see something you shouldn 't and you could wind up like Harold Beale in the bottom of the Hudson River . I know that- - but I still think we should give him a chance . You didn 't return my call . How did you get in here ? I 've been calling you since last night . Your apartment ; here . No calls came in here . I , uh ... overheard you say we might work together . What about it ? If we do , what do we go after ... aliens or narcotics ? Well , one hand washes the other , Mr. Vincent . No deal . We 're going after aliens . We find narcotics , they go in the river . Let 's go . I don 't know , Mr. Scoville . I told them I 'd listen to them , but that 's all . You bet I will . Yes , sir . All right , what do you want , David ? A story in your paper . Saying what ? A crate containing wreckage from that collision between the weather satellite and the meteorite is being moved from Pier 56 to Comden Air Base tomorrow . A trap story . They figure they missed one , they 'll come after it . That 's it . CALVIN : Sorry , I can 't do it . Edgar was right- - you lie down with dogs , you get up with fleas . It 's starting already . You want me to put a phony story in the paper ... And next we 're going to ask you to trip a blind widow crossing the street in traffic . Look , you want them as much as we do . You know , scruples are marvelous but , uh , this once , do yourself a favor- - forget them . That 's not the way , Kalter . Mike ... how about it ? Just one favor . All right , the morning edition . ( wry laughter ) Well , where are your aliens , Mr. Vincent ? Maybe they didn 't see the story in the paper . Or maybe they saw it and didn 't believe it . Or maybe I just talked myself into it because I wanted to believe . Well , I think we 've wasted enough time . Let 's go back . Not yet . We 're almost to the air base . Turn around . We 're being followed . Pull over . I don 't want any trouble . What 's the speed limit through here ? Sixty-five . I 'm doing 50 . Pull over- - I said I don 't want any trouble . You hear a siren or see red lights ? I don 't think he 's a cop . ( explosion ) ( tires squealing ) ( tires squealing ) Come on . Let 's get out of here . This tank is going to blow . ( loud explosion ) ( sighs ) Now , why did you do it , Vincent ? I wanted you alive . Now we 're such good friends ? So you can tell your people what you know . Well , you saved my life . Now we 're quits . ( coin clattering ) Now , who do you think really took the shipment ? I told you what happened this morning . But you didn 't see any of those things that Vincent told you about ? They hit the truck . That ought to prove something . We 're just asking what , Pete . What did the motorcycle cop look like ? He looked like a cop . Look , I know this sounds wild . Pete , this Vincent 's running you in circles . Maybe he 's trying to make a deal for our stuff for someone outside the country . Bring him in . Mr. Vincent , we don 't want any harm to come to you , or to anyone else for that matter . We 'll forget that you know something of our operation . Now , what is this all about ? Tell us the truth . I told you everything I can . Oh , be reasonable . Bloodless people with no heart or pulse- - it 's too much . ( phone rings ) We 're waiting . ( phone ringing continues ) We 're wasting our time . Good day , Mr. Vincent . If I walk out of here , how far do I get , Kalter ? Kalter 's out of it now . Yes . Oh , hello , Mr. Scoville . No , I 'm sorry , he 's not here . And you 'll have to remember that when Dom called several times yesterday , you said he wasn 't there either . Dom ... Yes , Mr. Kalter ? How many times did you call Mr. Scoville yesterday ? Six ... seven . You 're a liar . You didn 't call at all . Why not ? What is this foolishness , Peter ? How do you know he didn 't call ? Scoville told me . You 'll take his word over one of your own ? Maybe he has a reason for not having called . Maybe he wanted to keep us apart . What reason ? I called . You 're a liar . Why ? Kalter , feel his pulse . See if he has one . Dom ... Mr. Kalter , you 're not going to listen to this guy . You 've had your pulse taken before . Hold out your hand . ( gunshots ) As I said , no blood , no pulse or heartbeat . When they die they incinerate . Are there many of them ? Enough . Now , will you work with us ? We 'll have to dig them out . And find our shipment . Pete ... Give Mr. Vincent whatever he needs . He 's here . ( knocking on door ) There 's your man , Vincent . Name 's Amos Foster . Look , I 've got an office down at the city hall . Why do you drag me way out here ? This is private . You 're with the building permits bureau ? Industrial . I need a list of factories and warehouses that have been given permits to use high-voltage lines- - the maximum the city allows . Recent ? The last three or four months . There aren 't too many of those . I could have it for you by tomorrow . I need it today . Look ... ! By noon . Can we depend on him ? Yeah , he 's on our payroll for as much as the city pays him . You can depend on him . Well , when he brings the list , I want every place checked . Do you have enough men ? Yeah , we 've got enough men . Look for places that are abandoned or seem to be out of business . If you see any activity , call me . Vincent 's war isn 't ours . All we want is our shipment back . And we have to be careful not to get involved . ( knocking ) Foster came through with a list of three places- - two warehouses and a private museum . Vincent wants to get on it right away . All right . You know what to look for . If you find the shipment , bring it to me and , uh ... thank Mr. Vincent for us . Yes , sir . No , wait a minute . Look , I couldn 't care less about Vincent , but these aren 't hoodlums we 're fighting . You saw what happened with Dom . If Vincent 's right , we 're going to need him . It 's not our fight . Let 's look out for number one , eh , Pete ? Just like you said . Our guy heard a humming sound that shook the place . No power lines leading to it . No power lines ? No . Let 's look around . Maybe the next one , huh ? If there 's anybody inside , take them alive . ( electronic whirring ) But you can 't deal with them . They want a meeting . We 'll meet with them . How can it hurt ? You know what they are . Vincent 's told you . Pete , we don 't care what they are . All we want is to get the shipment back . I wasn 't thinking of ... of us . He told you how they work , what they want . Relax , Peter . If they take over the world , they 'll have to take it over from us . Good afternoon . My name is Weller . This is Mr. Court and Mr. Kalter . I call myself Dorcas . Can I offer you gentlemen a drink ? Thank you , that isn 't why we came . We would like you to leave our installations alone . No . We know why you 're applying this pressure . Then , you know how you can stop it . Return the shipment to you ? You have it , then ? DORCAS : Yes , but not with us . Well , deliver it to us and we 'll work this out . That 's one condition . We also want David Vincent . No deal . There is no deal without Vincent . We 'll destroy the shipment . And we 'll destroy every other installation of yours we can lay our hands on . DORCAS : That will only keep us out of the city for a little while ... and you won 't get your drugs back . Pete ... he 's making sense . You know what they 'll do to Vincent . DORCAS : No need to be upset , Mr. Kalter . We 'll take Vincent dead or alive . If you like , you can kill him . Of course , we would need proof . Dorcas ... you have yourself a deal . Pete ... take care of it , will you ? Mike ... Edgar . Good to see you , David . Everything all right ? Just fine . I 've heard about your successes . Congratulations . Kalter has a very efficient organization . Yes , he has . As a matter of fact , he 's knocking over everything in sight . I just heard from Mike what 's next . You . Kalter 's put out a contract on you . Who told you ? I know a hundred hoods . The small ones talk . David , you better leave the city at once . I 'll arrange a place for you to hide out . He 's right . Do it . Why would he want to kill me before he got his shipment ? I smell a deal . He wouldn 't make a deal . You can 't be sure . David , you 've got to protect yourself . I hear you 're trying to kill me . You 're asking me to deny a rumor , Vincent . I never do that . Now , you either trust us or you don 't . I don 't care what Calvin said . No , there 's nothing to it . Why should we ? You made a deal with the aliens , me for the shipment . Look , I 'll even go with you tonight . There 's a club over on Yale Street- - The Red Lion . Meet me there in an hour . Fine . He denied it , of course . He 's going with me . I know ... I could be walking into a trap . Think he 'll show up , Pete ? Yes . You were very convincing . Very . Is something bothering you , Pete ? Like what ? You told me to set him up ; I set him up . What more do you want ? At the meeting today , you almost blew the deal . I said I 'd go through with it and I will . And we appreciate it . ( soft , slow piano music playing ) Ah , Vincent . Sit down . We 're going to need help tonight . Where are the rest ? They 'll be enough . I said , sit down . What 'll you a drink ? Nothing . I 'll have another . What are we celebrating ? You name it . We have work to do , you know ? Ah , yes . We 'll get it done . You own this place ? We own a lot of places . A lot of people , too . That 's what makes the system run . It seems to me , it runs on fear . Most things do . I was watching you with Court and Weller . I 'm glad you understand that , Vincent . Everyone 's afraid . We all have to do certain things , whether we ... want to or not . The only way to avoid unpleasant things is ... to get out . In my business , there 's only one way out . Do you blame me for wanting to stay alive ? You don 't have to apologize for it . I wasn 't apologizing , Vincent . I just want you to know that I do what I have to do ... in order to stay alive . That 's right ... I have a gun in my hand . So you did sell out . Why not ? What you 're doing , that 's not my fight . Scoville said so ; my people said so- - " Butt out , Kalter . Look out for number one . " Who 'd you set me up for- - the organization or the aliens ? Get up , Vincent . Walk to the door . Don 't try to run . Please . Ring the bell . ( bell ringing ) Here 's our part of the deal . Do your own killing . Very well . There 's our part . Take Vincent . Hold it ! Open the crate . It 's all there , Mr. Kalter . DAVID : Kalter ... You had better call it off . I 'm afraid he can 't . What is this ? We 've been observing how your organization works , Mr. Kalter . Isn 't this how you protect yourself at a meeting of this kind ? Well ? It 's the stuff . This does not concern you , Mr. Kalter . Put them away . Let 's go . Go on , Kalter . You don 't owe me anything . Go on ! It 's not your fight , remember ? ! Hit them ! Look out ! Well , you didn 't get what you were looking for . Neither did you . Maybe . He didn 't recover their drugs . That 's all they cared about . Well , if it wasn 't for that , it would have been for something else . If not now , later . I don 't know . He had it all- - everything he wanted . He didn 't have to take any risks except this one- - to save David 's life . All in all ... I don 't think he did too badly . NARRATOR : Two hours after his decision to save David 's life , Peter Kalter left the organization for good . He had joined the fight against another organization- - a fight which David Vincent will continue .

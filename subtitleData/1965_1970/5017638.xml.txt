 An experiment , conducted by some scientists on laboratory rats has shown that , in an overcrowded population repression and dominance bring about a ruthless struggle for survival . A struggle that leads to social aberrations of a pathologic and monstrous nature . Sexuality becomes madness , cannibalism . After a few months of observation , it was determined , first of all , that this disintegration of social structure was besetting both males and females . A vicious war for supremacy began between the males which lasted uninterruptedly and with a remarkable fierceness until the strongest prevailed . Having become Chief , the strongest would then isolate himself with females and would force them to wait for him in a sort of harem while his vigilance dominated from above the lives of his subjects . Deprived of females , the males mated with each other , lacking any alternative . They would go out just to eat and as soon as they met the Chief , they would try to mount him unconsciously according to that process called homosexuality of identification . More serious was the alteration of maternal behaviour . The females , having become pregnant and perhaps sensing the tense atmosphere , refused to bear and preferred pain to motherhood until bursting into a slow and exasperated agony . A few agreed to deliver , but right after they lost interest in the offspring . Thus , unable to raise their babies they were forced to abandon them watching their cries for help impotently . Where they managed to avoid being devoured by the adults the survivors , isolated and deprived of motherly care , could not follow a regular pattern of development and grew up abnormal and deformed . After a while the general neurosis and the succession of such phenomena increased the social pathology rate with sudden violence leading to a single result ... the extinction of the population . Thank you . No , thanks ! My name 's Tommaso . We 're going to see the boss , right ? You don 't say ' boss ' . Chief ! What 's that ? Come here . Hey , but ... But you 've got amazing machines here . Of course we 've got amazing machines here ! Want to see how it works ? Tell him ' mao ' . Miaow . - Mao ! Say it louder . There you are ! And now eat . Come . How wonderful ! Whose is this ? - What do you mean ? The Chief 's , no ? Go down , knock , go in . How did you stumble ... I really don 't know how it happened . Please , forgive us . How are you ? Please , please . Sit down , don 't be afraid . The Professor told me that you 'd asked to speak to me . Something 's wrong ? Yes . I mean , no . I just wanted to know ... My job ! What exactly does my job entail ? Don 't worry . The work isn 't the main thing . It 's the training that counts . And before the training ... The ob ... The ob ... ? Didn 't the Professor tell you ? - What ? The obedience ! In freedom , of course . - Yes . Maybe you don 't agree ? - No . I mean , yes . Of course I agree . Good . A little formality , then you 're free . Relax , please . Tell me , did you have an enjoyable trip ? Yes , rather enjoyable . Thanks . But ... But what are you ... ? Excuse me , my hair ! This will be your new face . Do you like it ? It 's nice . Very nice . But ... I beg your pardon . - Well ? But , sorry , it 's not me ! - See that we agree ? Now , you can go . Come on , son , down there . Where are we going ? You heard the Chief 's speech on obedience , right ? So what ? - So , don 't ask questions . Watch and learn ! Down . Come on , don 't stand there like a doll . Tell her something . Hi ! I 'm Tommaso . Amazing , isn 't it ? I might be wrong , but ... But I 'm under the impression that you 're all mad in here . Who is that ? The founder . Today 's her birthday . She 's turning 100 . Why 's she dressed that way ? - For the sake of continuity . Today ... It 's called ' computer ' , a docile and friendly machine , capable of planning our future . Repeat . It 's called ' computer ' , a docile and friendly machine capable of planning our future . Using massive computer power , we 've arrived at the following corollary : We live in a scientific society where we must all strive to be equal because our needs must be equal . The only tolerable differences between individuals should be channelled by us into harmless areas for the social order 's benefit . One such area might be , for example ... the sphere of eroticism and intercourse . Within this eroticism , individual discrepancy is tolerated because sexuality means , indeed the ejaculation of instincts that go against order . This concept of collective freedom replaces the false and harmful concept of individual freedom . To the individual freedom you have to say ' no ! ' . Because ... ? Because ... ? Because it 's evil . - Because ... ? Because ... I don 't know . Because ... ? ! Because the individual freedom is not freedooooooom ! It 's called ' technocracy ' , the science of power over freedom ... Who was that ? If within 80 seconds ... none of those who heckled come forward ... we 'll be forced , in spite of ourselves , to take ... collective measures ! Premise . The infamous episode of the previous lesson must not occur again . Man is only a molecular aggregate . What matters is the technique . It 's not for nothing that " tekne " in Greek means " art " . The civilization of today ... can be none but a mass civilization . Our slogan should be just this : " Thumbs down , towards the individual . " Let 's recall , please , the " Three R 's " , consequences of individuality . Repression . Revolution . Ruin . There 's no progress without order . There 's no order without community . There 's no community without a leader . End of the premise . Forgetfulness ... Aristotle said it too . Some are born to rule , others to obey . It 's called ' programmed subordination ' , the state of calm required so that a society can grow in opulent development . Repeat . No , no . Let her speak . What is it ? Are you feeling bad ? Something 's wrong ? - Yes . The things you 've said . It 's nothing but a load of crap . She 's crazy ! Hush her up ! Enough ! Sure ! Enough of this story about scientific power ! We want to be independent ! In-de-pen-dent ! Freedom for what ? To masturbate ? Here ! This was my baby . He 's 2.5 centimetres long . He died because I preferred him in here , rather than among people like you ! Free-free-freedom ! Free-free-freedom ! Enough ! Enough ! Enough ! Stop it ! Pacification . Pacification . The computer , no ! Stop him ! Ejaculation . Repression . We must , we must , we must ... We must find a way ... to have a meeting here ... at the castle , with that girl ... As soon as possible . - I 'm afraid it 'll be difficult . She won 't accept . They don 't want to negotiate . Tell them that they 'll solve nothing by continuing to protest in here . That I 'm willing to give in . In short , invent whatever you like . They won 't be persuaded . Well , don 't you worry . You can go now . You too ! Go away ! I 'm fine ! I 'm feeling all right ! Actually , you 're dismissed . Get lost ! Please . I 'll precede you . Thanks for having agreed to come . Please , come in . You can go . If you wish to read them , here are our demands . How are you ? You two will agree , you 'll see . You 'll seeeeeee . Yes . I acknowledge these things are all correct and ... But you aren 't going to stand , are you ? Take a seat . Take a seat . Let 's see now ... We 've noticed some mistakes . Big mistakes . - Well , mistakes ... Believe me , what we did ... We did ... only in the belief that it was for your own good . For the good of everyone , exclusively . - Everyone ... What you ask for , it will be given ... Not given . Fulfilled . If you want to be free at once ... All together . Free . Fighting ... For reform ... - For me ? ... democratic . All united in a spirit of fraternity ... All together ... - Everyone ... Mutually . Actually , I 'm ... I 'm speaking on behalf of others . But , honestly , I must say that ... that I would never have thought you capable of self-criticism . Thank you . There , there ! So , peace is sealed . See ? I was right . I-de-a : why don 't you have a reconciliation dance , eh ? Actually ... I 'd like to go back . Then ... A toast ? Absolutely , yes . Gloves , please . Thank you . Pull harder , please . Little , silly and subversive ! Are you sure ... order will be restored this way ? Of course . Of course I am . And the others ? What will they say ? - Who cares what they 'll say ? After all , we 're paying them , right ? So , it 's clear that they become our property . It 's atrocious . They ate Bea . - What ? Yes . Choked then boiled . I 'm shaken . Please ... Please , I 'd like to ask you to accept me among yourselves . Eaten ? How could it happen ? - Of course it could . The only way to hide a body is to swallow it . - Well said . Down with the Chief ! I propose an assassination attempt . I say : Enough ! Enough violence ! Let 's go away . Don 't talk bullshit . Perhaps you 'd rather end up between his teeth ? My plan is very simple . May I ? We 'll pretend everything 's like before . We 'll wait along the route the Chief takes with his motorbike and then , BANG ! The end of the dictatorship . What about the centenarian ? - Oh , we 'll take care of her later . Besides , she may be of use to us . Now , for a trial run , we need two things . One : a stand-in for the Chief . Two : someone to do the deed . With regard to the stand-in ... Providing you agree ... How about a handsome Negro ? Voil√† ! This is Samantha . He looks likeable , doesn 't he ? - Yes ! And this ... This is the deputy . He 'll be our consulting engineer . What about Tommaso ? Where 's Tommaso ? Here comes Tommaso ! An assassination attempt . It 'll come off well . - Why do I have to be the perpetrator ? Well , it 's easy to stand apart and be an onlooker . It 's time to enter the fray . To become a protagonist ! Load it ! - What do you mean ? Blanks , of course . - Blanks ? No way ! This is real ! Tommaso , Tommaso ... The bike ! Come on , shoot ! Pretend it 's a game . Haven 't you ever played Cowboys Indians ? Come on , bang-bang ! Let 's go ! Come on , come on ! The motorbike 's ready ? All right , guys . Is everyone ready ? Tommaso , to your position . Can I go too ? Seven ... Six ... - Stop ! - Five ... The cigarette . - The cigarette ? - Don 't ask questions , negro . Inhale . OK , spread out . - Goooood . Remember , negro , that you have the honour of wearing the helmet of a marine . Bang ! Bang ! Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? You thought the trial run was a game ? Maybe you think the Chief is a puppet to be trifled with ? Come on , guys . Clear up . Clear up , boys . The trial run came off well . Actually , very well . Take it , boy . Chew . Do you want to leave ? Run away ? You and me . Far away . An elopement . An elopement . Don 't cry . Don 't do that . Come on ! One ... Two ... And threeeee ! Did I hurt you ? - A little . But I 'm content . It could 've been more painful . Tommy ? - What ? - It was great , you know ? - Really ? Come on ! - Again ? But , maybe ... We 'd better stop . Once there were two people who got stuck and never got untangled . It must be awful . Alice , this morning I was thinking ... Why don 't we stop talking ? Anyway , it doesn 't do any good . Tommaso , I 've got to talk to you . No , enough ! I feel like talking now . I 've had it . There 's nothing here . It 's all too primordial . We should , at least , do some repairs . Yes . I want to furnish the house . Hey ! Hey ! That 's it ! Now , the only thing missing is electricity . So ... Well ? Do you like it or not ? I do . It 's wonderful . So ... What have we come up here to do ? I 'm bored . Would you like to be seduced by a spirit ? Alice , where are you ? Alice ... Alice , stop it ! Where are you ? Stop it ! Please ! What the hell have you ... ? What 's wrong ? Why are you so sad ? Nothing ever happens here . I 'd like you to entertain me . Would you like to be frozen ? And be awoken by the kiss of a beautiful princess . Keep quiet ! Don 't break the spell ! Don 't cry , or you 'll ruin everything . Alice , let 's drop it . Listen , Alice ... I 'm begging you , hurry up . Hurry up ... There ! There ... Listen , Alice . I ... I would like to see you being deep-frozen ! Now , enjoy yourself . Tommy , don 't stand like that . Become something . What exactly ? Well , I don 't know ... The mantis ! How about pretending to be a mantis giving birth ? No , thanks . I well know how that 'll end up ! OK then . Don 't talk to me anymore ! You always say you love me but , when I ask you something , you always find an excuse . You don 't love me anymore , that 's the truth ! Alice , you know I love you . All right ... What do I have to do ? Good . You 'll go out now . These things aren 't for you . Go . Sorry , Alice , but , don 't mantises lay eggs ? Yes . You mustn 't move , do you understand ? And don 't speak ! Now , come inside me . Easy ! So , it 's over , at last ? So , it 's over , yes or no ? Please , what am I to do ? Once his function is performed , the male is no longer needed ! Come in . Oh , you stumbled . I 'm very sorry . Well , what can you do ? You always end up by getting recaptured . What has become of the Chief ? Well , there was an assassination attempt , right ? Poor thing . He was talking too much . About technique , machines ... He didn 't understand that the machines ... depend on ... those who use them and that ... Excuse me . Do you mind waiting a moment ? Thanks . Where were we ? Oh , yes . You want to know , dear Tommaso , why , when someone rebels , we no longer talk about machines ? Simple ... We use them . Do you know ... Dear Tommaso , what happens to those who try to escape ? ... ness , order , legality ... . well-being , happiness . Order , legality ... well-being , happiness . Order , legality ... well-being , happiness ... One thing is certain . There 's nothing wrong with the machines . It 's Tommaso who doesn 't work . So , there 's only one solution : start all over again . The suicide attempt proves that the boy needs a partner . Let him couple and copulate . Re-pre-ss-ion . It is necessary to insist on the path of repression . The boy 's behaviour is a threat to the collective order . He suffers from an individualism ? Then , the solution can only be of a scientific kind . Take the brain of a submissive ... Transplant it into a boy 's head . See him , from now onwards , grateful , smiling , obedient . What about the others ? They have to see Tommaso obedient , of course , but also aware ... Aware that he has been subdued . Otherwise , the warning would be of no value . The boy 's up to something . We can 't be certain of winning by letting him copulate . Dear Tommaso , great news ... We 've decided to let you copulate . Happy ? Really ? How nice ! - What ? You don 't even ask with whom . - With whom ? With whom ? You want to know too much . It 's doesn 't matter with whom . What matters is forming a family unit . To have many , many children ... Healthy and submissive . But , come now ... Here we go . Moustache . Let 's see . Very nice . The little bow . The little bow . That 's done . Small cough . Well done . That 's it . Let 's see . Let 's see ... No ! Moustache no good for you . A sweet , submissive smile . Well done . That 's it . About face !

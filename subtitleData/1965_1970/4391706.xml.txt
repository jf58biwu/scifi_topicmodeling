 You know , I was raised in these woods . Got my name carved on half those maples . My name and a few of the local ladies from Bennington . I think we 'll coast from here . If there are any guards , I don 't want them to hear us . I 've been here twice without seeing any guards . I figure if it 's what you say it is , they do their business at night . It 's over there . Looks like the world 's fair in there ; tubes , flashing lights and pretty exotic circuitry . You 're the only one who could say for sure . ( leaves rustling ) ( door opening ) ( bullet ricochets ) Garth ! Stop ! You can put your weapon away . No one will harm you . I give you my word . You all right ? Yeah . A ricochet caught me in the leg . Can you walk ? I think so . Don 't take me ... for your own good . Can you hold out until we get him to Washington ? You 'll never get to Washington . Two men . They 've broken into the lodge . They 've taken the leader . Get the others . I 'll get rid of the equipment . But hurry , we 've got to get the leader back . NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Alfred Ryder , Karen Black , Kent Smith , Anthony Eisley and special guest star Laurence Naismith . NARRATOR : A surprise encounter in a closed ski lodge , the capture of an alien being whose importance David Vincent cannot know . A leader whose loss jeopardizes the invaders foothold on the planet Earth . How far to the main road ? Three , maybe four miles . ( winces ) Is the leg bad ? No . I 've done worse shaving . You heading for the motel ? Yeah . We can call Ed from there . We 'd better call the police first . I 'll call the police . Get me the police . You appear to be a sensible man , mister ... Torin . Mr. Torin . I don 't know what your friend has told you ... There was a Mary Torin . Does that ring a bell ? No . Los Angeles , October 11 . A motel on Garvey Street . I 'm not familiar . A couple of your boys murdered her . I read a report . My wife . Mary Torin . Remember the name . Mr. Torin , I ... And remember this- - there are seven of us now . It 's a new ball game . We 're at the Lexington Motel . Now , they know we have him . All right . Now , how long do the police say they 'll take ? About ten minutes to get here , but they 're checking the lodge , too . Can you stay where you are ? It could get pretty warm here . You know where Camp Belding is ? No , but I 'm sure Bob Torin does . Get there . Ask for Colonel Ralph Gentry . I laid a Nike site in for him in ' 64 . Use my name . I think you 'd better come up here , Ed . Right . I 'll meet you at Belding . Soon as you can . Bye . I 've covered everything between here and the lodge . They must have turned off somewhere . Well , maybe the motel . You know , I went through Anzio without a scratch . All through the war and nothing worse than a hangnail . Gentlemen , you 're doing a very foolish thing . You think so ? Where I come from , I am a leader . There is no equivalent here . Unless I am released , there will be a terrible retribution . Like what ? One of your cities may be destroyed . Your leaders killed . I can 't be sure . If you were willing to destroy cities , you would have done so before now . We 've never been in a position like this . Make your offers to our leaders in Washington . Take your chances with them . I won 't make it to Washington . I must regenerate within seven hours . If I don 't , I shall die and you will have caused a bloody retribution . Now you take your chances with that ! Hear me out . Work with us . Become our liaison with your people . You can be masters ... rulers ... anything you want . Sorry . You 're determined to go on with this foolish plan . That 's right . Then I 'll make you a final offer . We will withdraw . Our expedition will retire . We will go home . Our war will be over , Mr. Vincent , and you will have won . All for my release . No one 's that important . I am . Nobody has that authority . I have . It could mean we 've won , David . ( door squeaks ) What guarantee do you offer ? You have my word . I 've been beaten , shot , tortured . My friends have been murdered and you ask me to take your word . You 're being emotional . Practical . We go to Washington . ( car approaching ) If you go out there , my men will kill those policemen . Every time my buddy gets on one of these benders , he thinks he sees elephants or men from Mars or something . I got a gallon of black coffee in him . He won 't bother you again , officer , I promise . He sounded sober to me . Yeah , well , he always does . MAN ( over radio ) : Car five , come in . Car five , come in . Frank , we 're at the Walden Ski Lodge . Whoever called must have been a crank . The place is empty . Okay . You heard him . Now , he better not call again or next time he sleeps it off in jail . Right , sir . Th-thanks , officer . David ... It 's no good . You go ahead . Is there an army camp around here- - Camp Belding ? About 12 miles north . Well , Ed 's flying in . We can make contact with him there . I know this area . You sit on our friend here , and I 'll drive to Belding . Think you can make it back to the car on that leg ? Well , if they 're following you . All right . You ask for Colonel Gentry . We 'll head for that farmhouse over there . You and Ed send back help , all right ? Take care of that leg . Right . Move out . Any sign of them ? No . Well , keep looking . ( knock on door ) Who is it ? Can we come in ? It 's an emergency . Do you have a telephone ? MAN : What is it ? Two men , Grandpa . They just want to use the phone . Oh . Well , tell them not to make so much noise . Operator . Operator , uh ... Contact the others . We 've got him cornered . Give it up , Mr. Vincent . What 's this all about ? Who are you ? Who are those men out there ? Police . This man 's a kidnapper . He 's holding me for ransom . It 's not true . They 're not police . They 're from another country . I was trying to call the police . Don 't believe him . He 's got the gun . MAN : Let her go . I said , let my granddaughter go . You 're making a mistake . A mistake . Of course . So those men out there kicking up my seedlings are enemy agents , are they ? Foreign devils come to murder us while we sleep . That 's right . And you say you 're being held as bounty ? That 's the truth . Well , the one truth we know for sure is that I have this gun and one of you two gentlemen is a liar . Claudia , take the young man 's gun . Now ... to determine the truth . Try the back . Wonderful ! Beings from another planet , you say ? Son , you really are most entertaining . Feel his pulse . Go on- - feel his pulse . I don 't feel any pulse . He has no pulse . He has no heartbeat . He 's not human . I 've known men without hearts before . Cold stone men who still were born of this earth . There 's nothing new about a man without a heart , but a man without a pulse , now that 's something else again . And if you were some rare creature from the galaxies come a conquering would that be so bad ? Tell me , do you have war on your planet ? Napalm ? Gas ovens ? Compared with what we 've got , they can 't be so bad . Let them come . I 'll give them a hand . I don 't care what you think as long as you keep your gun on him until help arrives . Help ? I sent a friend of mine to a nearby army base to get help . Put that gun on the table . You ... step back . Kill them . Claudia , will you make some tea for our ... guests ? Or would you prefer coffee ? Nothing . No , thank you . I guess you don 't drink tea where you come from . You should cultivate that habit . A cup of tea is a sobering thing when men contemplate the planets . Grandpa , make them get out . Take your gun . Please , go . Put the water on , will you , girl ? Mr. Vincent , I 've five hours left . May I remind you that unless I 'm out of here in time , this entire house and everyone in it will be destroyed . Yes , sir . My name is Torin . I have to see Colonel Gentry . It 's important . One moment , sir . The Colonel will be happy to see you , sir . If you 'll just park over here in the visitor 's lot , a car from the motor pool will be here any minute . Look , I don 't have time for that . Where are you headed ? Colonel Gentry . Hop in the back . Corporal , see to his car . Where are the Colonel 's quarters ? This is taking too long . Where you going ? Where you ... Do you know that the doctors and I have been trying to keep this man alive for four years ? And you come in here with your guns . Sorry . You know what you 're doing ? You know who this man is ? Claudia . He 's Cyrus Stone . Cyrus Stone- - that 's whose life you 're risking . The poet . Yes . You think a million of them , or you are worth one Cyrus stone ? Yes , I 'm guilty of poetry . But it doesn 't mean much anymore . My granddaughter 's under the illusion that , because 20 years ago a man could string a few words together , he 's somehow greater than a mere mortal . Maybe she 's right . Nonsense . Anyway , I 'll be the judge of that . Surprises some folks to think that I lived to 71 on my own . And they 're sure I 'll never reach 72 without them to look after me . Don 't make fun of me , Grandpa . Fun ? No ... not for the world . I 'm just a little surprised is all . And flattered that a girl like you should stay with a worn-out old farmer like me . It 's not so hard for me , growing old , but it sure plays the devil with my poetry . I 've gone out of style here . Maybe you could , uh ... make me popular where you come from ? You see , we trade in our poets like we trade in our autos- - a new one every year or two- - when the chrome tarnishes or the styles change . My time was back a ways ... before megatons and , uh ... overkill . I don 't find those words very poetic . ( glass breaking ) ( gunshot ) Get back , or I 'll kill him . Get back ! Yes , I ... I would say poetry is out of style . You 're only buying hours , Mr. Vincent . You can 't win . Let me go and save these people . Why can 't you let him go ? There 's more at stake than the three of us . They 'd kill us as soon as he got out the door . My grandfather has a bad heart and you 're killing him . My friend is bringing help . I can 't let him go . Bob ! Three hours , Mr. Vincent . I could go into that truck and be regenerated in five minutes . Then I could come back and we could talk this over reasonably . First Mary Torin , then Bob . I should kill you right now . Uh ... Claudia ? Yes , Grandpa ? Oh , uh , I went to sleep . Yes , our ... spaceman . Do you sleep ? No . Ah . What a world without sleep ... with people scurrying back and forth like ... sables . I don 't think I 'd like that . Mr. Stone , I 'm going to try to make it to Camp Belding . Will you watch him ? I 'm not sure . Why do you think I should ? My friend is dead . Now , obviously , he didn 't make it to Belding so the authorities don 't know we 're here . Someone has to tell them . Well and good , but ... if you 're not back in a couple of hours , he dies . If he does , those wild , red Indians out there will come in here and scalp me and that girl . No , I ... don 't think you can trust me at all . Mr. Stone ... Mr. Stone , with that gun in your hands , you can force him to let me go . I 've been reading your poems , Mr. Stone . A world ... a world you 've dreamed of ... a world ... without poverty- - think of that ... a world without war , without disease . You 're ill , Mr. Stone . Your heart is failing . Yes . For those of us who have hearts , they sometimes fail . Our medicine can cure that . How would you like another 20 years ? 50 years ? How many ... poems could you write in 50 years , Mr. Stone ? Who would read them ? When we 're all your slaves , who 'd have time for poetry ? Yes , Mr. Man from Space , who would read them in a world of slaves ? Who reads them now ? You said you 'd been forgotten . But ... 50 years to create beauty . 50 years . What do you say to that , boy ? When I was in college , I drew plans for a city . No one was standing around waiting to read those plans but I drew them ; I had to . Because I knew one day somebody might build that city . There has to be someone to create for ... or what sense does it make ? Mr. Vincent , even in a world of slaves , there are masters with taste and intellect- - men who 'd appreciate your poetry . Mr. Stone ... I offer you a world with poets as kings . Are there poets on your planet ? Of course . I 'd like to hear one of your poems . I 'm going to Camp Belding . I 'll guard him . David , wait . I hate dying . I 've cherished life . The thought of leaving it angers me . But I 'll die if need be . But that girl , now , that 's something else again . Grandpa ... I make one condition for my death . The girl goes with you , and she lives . Now , you see to that . Grandpa ... don 't send me away . It 's time , girl . There 's a world out there . Grandpa ... Take her out through the cellar quickly . They 'll die out there . If they do , you 'll die in here . Pour me out another cup of tea ... if you would be so kind . Well , if you hear from them , would you ask them to call me ? Please . Edgar Scoville , Camp Belding , Colonel Gentry 's office . The motel doesn 't know where they are ? No . Can you tell me what this is about , Ed ? Two friends of mine are in something up to their necks ... and I don 't know how to get them out . ( knocking on door ) Come in . Yes , sir ? That man you said wanted to see me- - uh , Torin- - where is he ? I thought with you , sir . I never saw him . He came on the base ? Yes , sir . And ... just disappeared ? He hitched a ride with some lieutenant . What lieutenant ? I don 't know , sir . You never saw him before ? No , sir . If they 're still at Belding , find them . Yes , sir . Ralph , I need a favor- - no questions asked . Five or six men who can keep their mouths shut- - armed- - and a couple of Jeeps . I 'd come myself , Ed , but there 's a big flap on . Washington 's been on my ear all day . WOMAN : Camp Belding . Colonel Gentry 's office , please . The lines are busy , sir . Will you wait ? This is very important . Can you cut in ? I 'm sorry , sir . It 's a long distance call . Lieutenant , you going to Camp Belding ? Sure thing . Climb aboard . Claudia . Don 't worry . He 'll be all right . No . He 's a tired old man with a weak heart and he won 't be all right . You 're underestimating him . He 's one of the strongest men I 've met . He wants you to think that . What do you mean ? He wants to die . He 's told me . I can 't believe that . He has too much to give . He has one thing to give- - me . As long as he 's alive , I 'm going to stay with him . But he wants me to leave , to go out there , to be normal . He knows I won 't as long as he lives ... so he keeps saying he wants to die . Soon . If that 's what it takes . Why won 't you go out there ? You don 't think it 's normal either ... to be a 19-year-old girl living on a farm in the woods caring for an invalid ... if she loves him ? Loves his farm ? Loves his world ... better than yours ? It is unusual . What is normal for a 19-year-old girl . Miniskirts ? Protest marches ? Pot ? What 's normal for an architect who dreams of building cities ? I guess you 'll go back to the farm no matter what he says . Yes . I 'll go back to the farm . Hour and a half . Time is running out , Mr. Stone . Time is running out for us old men all over . It needn 't . Look out there . We can generate enough power out there to ... light a city or lift a rocket or erase this entire farm and everything on it . That power can give old men life . Or death . It 's up to you , Mr. Stone . Let them go ! Release me , and they 'll be free . Mr. Stone , don 't let him ... don 't let him go ! Yes , please , Grandpa , let him go ! No . Please , let me talk to him . I 'll convince him . Grandpa , you 've got to release him . Don 't you see ? She 's right , of course . All you can do now is wait for me to die- - that won 't take long- - and then they 'll kill you- - all of you . And for what ? If I let you go , we won 't be harmed ? You have my word . I 'd rather have something more substantial . But then ... go ahead . DAVID : Don 't do it ! Don 't believe them ! ( electronic crackling ) ( electronic crackling ) He 's dead . I 'm sorry he had to die . We thank you , sir . We feel better for that . There was no need . Now , if you will put down that gun . Wait . You 're not out of here yet , neighbor . You told me you 'd give me another 50 years of life . Yes . That machine out there can bring life , can 't it ? Yes , I told you . That 50 years ... give them to him . Bring him back with your life machine . I don 't know . That 's your ransom- - one life for one ... his for yours . A man 's brain can lack oxygen for only three minutes . Well , one is gone already , so you 'd better hurry . Garth ! Come here ! Save your tears , girl . Help me get him into the van . Current . Cut the power . I 'm sorry . We tried . Well , try again . Try again ! ( gasping ) Cut the power . You could have had the world . You gave it up for one man . Very peculiar species , we men . We value life exceedingly . That 's why we endure . Remember that , Mr. Man from Space , when you go a-conquering- - that 's why we endure . Put him on the sofa . We robbed you . Of what ? Those years you gave him . They could have been yours . Child , child , child ... If only I hadn 't run ... if only I hadn 't called out to you . It 's done with now ... and you daren 't feel guilt . ( David moaning ) Claudia ... Hush . Don 't talk . Where are they ? It 's all right . They 've put everything back as it was . No one will ever know they 've been here . We 'll know . Yes , we 'll know . They 've gone . Bob was born and reared in these woods . It 's a good part of the world . That 's what he always said . Thank you , my dear . ( knock on door ) Well , good-bye , son . So long . Remember that city when your war is over . Remember that city . Yes , sir . Good-bye , David . Good-bye . When you build that city , I 'd like to come live in it . NARRATOR : David Vincent , given life by his enemies , continues his search . And an old man and a girl will watch the skies and wait .

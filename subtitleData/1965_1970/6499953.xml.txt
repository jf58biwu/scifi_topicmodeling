 Man : Cipher , coding , optics ... Film labs , computers , experts in every field and yet we 're still left with 36 rather dreary and badly photographed color shots . Yet I 'm convinced they contain the clue we want . Have you tried superimposing ? Man 2 : Yes , we have , sir , but as you will appreciate the permutations on 36 run into millions . Well , coming to them relatively fresh one of us may get a sudden flash . That , you say , is loch ness ? Uh , yes , sir . We 've pinpointed the position exactly . Not an inspired photographer however brilliant a scientist . Extraordinary order of filming , isn 't it ? Loch ness , the Yorkshire moors , dartmouth , the eiffel tower , beachy head . What 's number six ? Hopelessly overexposed . Perhaps there 's a reason . There are nine on the roll very overexposed and as many under . The rest are correctly exposed . I , uh ... Hate to mention this , sir Charles but , um , it is possible that there is no clue to be found in these shots . How did you work that out ? Breaking a code or Cypher is a finite problem . But , as I 've said , with these we don 't know that there is a problem and if there is , on what level of reasoning it is set . We just haven 't thought of it . And I don 't accept that it is impossible to do so . Do we know where Seltzman is ? ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) Relax . Relax , old boy . It won 't be long now . ( Siren wailing ) Ah ... Colonel . Had a good trip ? Yes , thank you . Did they feed you before you left or would you care for breakfast ? No , thank you . I 'd appreciate knowing my duties as soon as possible . You 've no idea why you 're here ? All I know is I was sent here by the highest authority . You were indeed . You should feel very proud . I 'm gratified , certainly . And now if you 'd be kind enough to explain what I 'm supposed to do ... What sort of opinion would you form of that fellow ? Anybody who spends his time doing that must be rather stupid . You couldn 't be more wrong . Because he 's our most interesting citizen from every point of view ... Particularly yours . Why is that ? You 'll find out . Tell me ... have you heard of , um , Professor Seltzman ? Professor Jacob Seltzman ? I don 't seem to recall the name . Should I ? No , in your line of business , I suppose not . Doctor Seltzman is a great neurologist who became fascinated with the study of thought transference . I 've actually seen it done . In India . Where Seltzman studied for many years . As you know , the advanced yogi is capable of living in a state of suspended animation for months his mind and body dissociated . Now , what Seltzman did was to take this discipline several stages further and with scientific aid , he was able to transmit the psyche of one person ... into another . The mind of one man into another ? Impossible . I don 't believe it . Where is this Seltzman ? Nobody knows . The only man who may because he had the last contact with him is , um , our friend . Are you asking me to believe that it 's possible for me to become you and you to become me ? Not exactly . But near enough . I don 't believe it . If I told you ten years ago that you could have flown a rocket round the moon would you have believed that ? No , I suppose not . But why all this interest in Seltzman ? Colonel , you must be aware that all major powers have in their prisons one or two of each other 's spies . Yes . From time to time , diplomatic swaps take place . Imagine the power we would have if the spy we returned had the mind of our choosing . We could break the security of any nation . Let me show one or two other things that will interest you . ( Equipment beeping ) We call this our amnesia room . Rather proud of it . With it , we can erase the memory back to any point in time we choose . This man you see was extremely cooperative . He told us all we wanted to know in three days . With hardly any persuasion . So now we wipe out all unhappy memories of the village and put him back into circulation to gather more information . And this ... Is the Seltzman machine . ( Siren wailing ) ( Siren wailing ) Number two : Let me give you a dummy run . ( Zapping , faster beeping ) The device with which Seltzman finally succeeded in switching the minds of two people . ( Thunder-like booming ) ( Steady beeping ) Sleep well , my friend , and forget us . Tomorrow you will wake up a new man . ( Number six yawning and sighing ) ( Thinking ) : Hmm ... ( Humming ) Hmm ... yes ... Not a bad day . Let 's see ... Oh , yes ... Janet 's birthday present . ( Chuckles ) Hope she likes it . Can always change it if she doesn 't . What 's on for today ? Let 's see ... Uh ... car service ... Dentist appointment ... no , no , have to cancel that ... Because sir Charles ' lunches , they go on forever . But who can blame him ... ? He 's the boss . ( Humming ) Number two : Seltzman machine ... The device with which Seltzman finally succeeded in switching the minds of two people . Switching the minds of two people . Relax . Number six ( On megaphone ) : I am not a number . I am a person . ( Thunder booming ) Number two : You 're very aggressive . You mustn 't resist . ( Zapping , siren wailing ) Take it easy . It will all be one in the end . Number six ( On megaphone ) 1 unlike me many of you have accepted the situation of your imprisonment and will die here like rotten cabbages . I intend to discover who are the prisoners and who the warders . Number two : The thing to do now is keep calm . Keep your head . I will not be pushed , filed , stamped , indexed briefed , debriefed or numbered ! Number two : Just bear in mind your ultimate objective . We want information . Information ! Seltzman ... Seltzman . Proceed as our friend would have done . Relax ... cool . Now , go , boy , go . This is the time ... now ! Move or leave it . Move , move , move ! ( Electronic whining ) Seltzman ! ( Doorbell ringing ) His car ... is he back ? Is he with you ? Yes . Darling ? Darling ? Where is he ? Janet ... However fantastic what I 'm going to tell you may sound ... You must believe me . Who are you ? How do you know my name ? What are you doing here , anyway ? How did you get hold of his car ? Why ... why did you tell me he was here ? Who are you ? A friend . Well , then , where is he ? Why did he leave without a word to me ? Leave ? But he saw you , he told me he saw you last night . I didn 't see him last night . But he had dinner with you . After your fitting . What fitting ? Your dress . For the party . Your birthday party . He even told me the color : Yellow silk . Yellow silk ? The only yel ... That was a year ago . Yes , I ... I took him to the final fitting . I haven 't seen him since . A year ... ? A year ? What 's happened ? You couldn 't have seen him . Even if you had , he couldn 't have made that mistake . No , but I could have . I must have got it wrong . Yes , you must have . What are you doing here ? How did you get in , anyway ? Miss Portland ... You must be aware of the sort of work he did . Obviously , working for my father . So it won 't come as a surprise to you to learn that ... It may not be possible for him to get in touch with you for a year . Or even longer . Thanks . That 's a big help . Miss Portland ... I may have a message for you soon . When ? I 'll bring it to your birthday party . Father , I must have a word with you . You can see , my dear that this is not a very convenient time . I hope you don 't make a practice of bursting in like this . Yes , I know , I 'm very sorry , but it is important . And it 's personal , do you mind ? Perhaps , gentlemen , you would be good enough to give us a few minutes ? Certainly , sir . Thank you . Thank you . Now , my dear ... You know where he is . All this time you 've known and you 've let me go through this hell . You sent him on a mission . He can 't get in touch with me . I presume that you 're talking about your fiance . His house , his car ... he 's lent them to a friend . This friend , tell me about him . What sort of man is he ? Well , he 's perfectly ordinary . Is he unable to get in touch with me ? I honestly don 't know . Do you mean you haven 't sent him on a mission ? No , and you must realize I 'm telling you more than I should . I shouldn 't even tell you that . Do you mean even you don 't know where he is ? I have no idea . But you must know someone who does . There again , I can 't help you . It 's awful . I don 't know whether you 're telling the truth or not . Get me sir Charles ! Who are you ? What are you doing here ? I said get me sir Charles Portland at once ! You 're still as pompous as ever ... danvers . Where did you get my name ? Jonathan peregrine danvers . Born in bootle . Took elocution lessons . Came to London , joined the civil service in 1948 as a junior clerk . But moved to this department some three years later mainly at the request of the typing pool . Am I going to see sir Charles ? Well ? Or would you prefer me to go on ? I 'm sure these gentlemen would be most intrigued to hear of your little jaunt to Paris in march 1958 . Let me see now , what was her name ? What is your name ? Code or real ? Code . In France , duval . In Germany , Schmitt . You would know me best as zed . M.73. And your code number is p . R.12. Do you want more ? Seltzman . All right , thank you . Danvers , I must ask you to leave . Yes , sir . What do you know about Seltzman ? The inventor of the device that makes it possible to put one man 's mind into another man 's head . Sir Charles ... At last . I am zed . M.73. You claim to be zed . M.73. And I can prove it . Do so . I could pitch this on a very personal level , sir Charles . Don 't spare my feelings . Speak as freely as you wish . Very well . I will confine myself to simple domestic details . Of no interest to anyone except the family . Details which couldn 't be known by anyone except ourselves . Would you accept that ? Yes , I suppose so . You are a keen rosarian and it was when you were pruning your baccarats ... those ones down by the little goldfish pool ... when I asked you for permission to marry your daughter . ( Chuckles ) I remember you dropped the secateurs . I never understood why . It couldn 't have been that much of a surprise . The next day you took me to lunch at your club . Our favorite dish ... jugged hare ... was on the menu . I don 't dispute the accuracy of your statement . It is correct in every detail . Trouble is , there 's nothing you can tell me which may not have been told you by the person you claim to be under sedation or hypnosis . We 're all aware of truth drugs and other ingenious means of extracting information . You could have learnt it all parrot-fashion . Ask me the minutest details of anything you know that we did together . The same problem applies . I could never convince you then . Only sufficiently to intrigue me . To make sure that you are watched and followed every inch of wherever you go . It 's a waste of somebody 's time . He 'll be paid for it . Thank you . Thank you very much . Number six ( Thinking ) 1 where is he ? Where is he ? Where is he ? Did he perfect the reversal process ? If he didn 't , it 's a pity . Before I know it , I 'll be inside for forgery . Talking of forgery is my handwriting still the same ? Let 's see . Let 's try it . ( Chuckles ) That 's rather interesting , isn 't it ? That 's something . Well , let 's be grateful for small mercies . Now ... money . Unless the rats have been at it . Good . Still intact . Fresh as ever . Splendid . That should be adequate . ( Jazzy dance music playing ) Are you sure he 's being followed ? We 've attached a homing device to his car . Our man will be there by now . Music playing y ( music only , no dialogue ) I didn 't invite you . I haven 't taken it to heart . Our friend lent me his card ... A year out of date . Have you seen him ? Not exactly . Look , do you work for my father ? Did he send you here ? No , but I have no doubt that he knows that I 'm here . ( Slower dance playing ) When I arrived , they were playing a waltz . The first I danced with my love . My dear love , in kitzbuhel . How do you know all this ? Where is he ? Please ... I have a message from him . Before he went , he left something with you for safekeeping in case of trouble . A slip of paper . Yes ... yes , I have it . If you want to see him again , will you get it ? I 'll be in the arbor . May I ? Excuse me . Excuse me . Was she just trying to get rid of me ? Will she come ? Will she have the receipt ? ( Footsteps approaching ) I 'm sorry I was so long . Here it is . Thank you . Now , what was the message ? Simply this ... Who else could have given you that message ? Nobody but ... Couldn 't you say , " nobody but you ? " I need your faith . Nobody but ... You . Oh , I am sorry , sir . Am I late or are you possibly just a little bit early ? In a bit of a hurry , let 's put it that way . Then we mustn 't keep you a second , sir . What can I do for you ? I , um , I left some film with you . A roll of color which you dispatched for me . Uh ... here 's the receipt . Oh , thank you , sir . Just over a year ago . Yes . But you still have it , presumably ? Oh , certainly , sir . Just takes that second or two longer . Always the way , sir when we 're in a hurry , isn 't it ? I 'll be as quick as I can . Here we are , sir . If you 'll be kind enough to sign . Oh , that was quick . Number 31 , sir . It 's been signed for already . Uh , yes , sir , a stupid clerical error , I 'm afraid . One of our juniors handed over your transparencies in mistake for this number . Pure carelessness , of course . Confusing the last figures 0-1 and 1-0 . Needless to say , he wasn 't with us for very long . However , no damage was done because Mr. Carmichael returned your transparencies the moment he discovered our mistake . How very good of Mr. Carmichael . Very kind of you to take it that way , sir . Alas , no business can be entirely free from the occasional clerical error . Is there anything else , sir ? Yes . What is that , sir ? Can I get a photograph taken ? A photograph ? Yes . A passport photograph . I 'm afraid our photographer is away on holiday at the moment , sir . Hmm , he would be . As you say , sir . I won 't promise a flattering study of you , sir but , um , I think it will be satisfactory to the passport authorities . Thank you . Pleasure , sir . This way . He has collected the transparencies , sir . Ah , confirms my conviction . Somewhere they contain a clue and our bright boys have missed it . X.B.H. He 's gone inside . And now the living room curtains have been drawn . Sir Charles : Stay put until he leaves , then follow . Miss out one " m " . A , b , c , d , e f , g , h , I , j , k , I , m : 13 . And " n " must be 14 . Hello , sir . The curtains are being opened . He 's coming out of the house and getting into his lotus . Follow him . En route to definitely Dover . Oh , welcome to the village , sir . What would you like to order ? ( Slow beeping ) I took some photographs . Look ... that 's one . Is he still here ? Yes . Herr hallen , sir . Where is he now ? Oh , in the barber shop I suppose . ( Faster beeping ) Guten tag , mein herr . Good afternoon , herr hallen . The waiter at the cafe told me that I could get a shave here . That is correct , sir . Bitte , nehmen sie platz . Please , sit down , mein herr . Your English is very good . Yes . We barbers get around . In several big London stores . Very bad area , usually downstairs and so I come back to the village where I am born . Herr hallen , I may as well come to the point . I don 't want a shave . I want your help ... desperately . In what way , sir ? We have met before but you couldn 't possibly remember me because the first time we met ... I looked like this . It is not possible . You see , Professor Seltzman your invention works ... Only too well . I am a simple village barber . Don 't play tricks on an old man . Believe me , herr Professor you 're the last person in the world I would choose but somebody 's played a wretched trick on me . Do you recognize that face ? Of course . He was , he was a friend . But anyone who had that photograph could claim to be him . For what reason ? Perhaps you will tell me . I understand . Incognito until I can prove that I am that man . But everything I tell you can be countered by you . By saying that I have extracted the information by fair means or foul . Yes , that is so . Herr Professor ... Would you admit that as with fingerprints , no two handwritings could be the same ? I would . Then the only way that I can prove to you that I am that man depends on whether or not you kept that letter that I sent to you over a year ago from London when you were staying in Scotland . If you really are who you say you are you would not have expected me to keep it , would you ? No . It 's a hopeless situation . If I had kept it , I would have been very stupid . Silly . You 've made your point . I accept it . But you overlook one thing . Sentimental people are sometimes stupid . Very stupid . Wait , please . ( Faster beeping ) My poor young friend . But ... who ? I don 't know . The motive is clear . You will lead them to me . That is what they hope . Do you think your people have done this to you ? No , I 'm sure . Then it must be your enemies . My enemies presumably ... Having my other half ? Precisely . If we are taken by the side that hasn 't you must learn to accept yourself as you are . ( Faster beeping ) As both sides want my reversal process it will be a close race . Then the reversal process does exist ? In theory . But put into practice , it could be dangerous . Very . Here comes the first of our visitors . Is his face familiar ? Number 6 : Potter . We must not be taken by him . Then hide behind this door . G bell jingles ) Come in , come in . Don 't move , please ... Professor . ( Hissing ) ( Helicopter engine ) ( Door buzzes ) Ah ... Herr Professor . Welcome to our humble village . Had a good trip ? At least let me offer you some breakfast . You have kidnapped me for one reason . My answer is no . ( Chuckles ) You are livery this morning , Professor . Surely neither of us wants to prolong this interview . Life has not taught you sweet resignation . Nor has it for many other scientists . Rutherford , for example . How he must regret having split the atom . Yes ... almost as bad as splitting the identity of two human beings . Unlike all the king 's men , only you can put them together again . Don 't rely on it . Why make this stand now ? You must have known what you were doing when you invented the wretched process . Only people like you have made it wretched . Can you really leave this poor young man with his mind wrongly housed ? Surely you owe him some slight responsibility . I will do it ... On certain conditions . I 'm sure they will be reasonable . For once , I Al " ! Dictating . Heil . I will do it ... But alone . Under this condition only . I accept . Very well . I shall need time to prepare myself . In 12 hours . Number two : All cameras turn . Make a note of everything he does . ( Beeping and whirring ) ( Pulsing electronic tones ) ( Faster pulsing ) ( Zapping ) ( Faster pulsing ) ( Pulsing and zapping increase in intensity ) ( Pulsing and zapping stop ) Emergency . Examination room . Immediate treatment . Number two : Emergency ... emergency . Emergency ... emergency . ( Siren wailing ) He must not die . I need him . Thank you , colonel . Your help has been invaluable . I trust I 've been of service . Yes . You 'll be suitably rewarded . Your helicopter is waiting for you . You assured me that he was in good health . You must contact number one and tell him I did my duty . The colonel . ( Helicopter engine in distance ) The man who is just flying out of here ... Is not who you thought it was . I don 't believe it . I watched . I saw everything . The good doctor 's mind now inhabits a body perhaps not to his liking ... the colonel 's . Dr. Seltzman had progressed more than any of us had anticipated . He can and did change three minds at the same time . ( Engine in distance ) He is now free to continue his experiments in peace . ( Slam echoes )

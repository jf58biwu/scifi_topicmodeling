 That 's Wilk up there . Good-looking guy , huh ? Is that it ? Uh , the bandage ? Yeah . He was standing by the window when that deuce and a half backed into it . I 'll tell you , the piece of glass must 've been about a foot long . CHARLIE : Put a gash in his wrist about ... I don 't know , two , three inches long , something like that . No blood , huh ? Nothing . Of course , he took a handkerchief out and wrapped it around right away , but there was absolutely nothing . Why didn 't you tell somebody ? What am I going to say ? That you got a spaceman working as personnel manager ? Forget it . Where 's the security office ? Second door over . Keep an eye on him . Yeah . All right , Gilman , what do you want ? All right , Gilman , toss down that wrench ; climb up here . But he-he just burned up . He disappeared . It means you were right about him . It means you 're a murderer . NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Don Gordon . Russell Johnson . Harold Gould . Lynda Day . Malcolm Atterbury . NARRATOR : David Vincent , brought to Jackson City by a report of alien presence , must now help a friend account for the absence of that alien . At 2 : 00 this afternoon , Charles Gilman goes on trial for the murder of Fred Wilk . Sorry I 'm late , Mr. Vincent . Did you find anything ? No , I got nothing . So far , Fred Wilk checks out good as gold . Well , dig deeper . Before a year ago , he never existed . I need proof . I sent away for his high school transcript , college records . It would be easy to prove if he did exist . Look , you 're getting paid for this , aren 't you ? That 's kind of why I 'm here . I 'm a couple of days up on you . Got nothing on his wife yet , either . I 'm on my way over there now . Stick with it . We 're running out of time . Yeah , yeah , I 'm looking , believe me . I 'm just not finding . David : I 'm sorry to bother you at this time , but it is important . I see . Were you a friend of my husband 's ? No . A business associate , then ? No , actually , I 'm from the insurance company . Well , I 've already spoken to our agent . Well , this is the industrial accident policy that the company carries . I see . Uh , sit down . Thank you . There are a few questions I 'd like to ask you . Of course . First of all , how long did you know your husband ? Well , actually , I only knew him a few weeks before we were married . That was ... about a year ago . Was he from here in , uh , Jackson City ? Well , no . Uh , actually we moved here about the same time . I 'm from Springdale , and my husband is from a small town in Southern Indiana . Can I get you , uh , coffee or a drink or ... Thank you . Did you go to school in Springdale ? Since kindergarten . What about your husband ? I don 't see why all this is so important . ( doorbell rings ) Excuse me . ( door opens ) SLATER : Hello , Mrs. Wilk . JANET : Hi . I , uh , dropped by . I wanted to talk to you . Let 's see , uh , whose car is that outside ? I noticed somebody 's parked at the curb . JANET : Oh , it 's , uh , an insurance investigator . He 's from the company . SLATER : Oh ? What 's he doing ? Is he asking questions ? JANET : Well , yes . A lot of ... strange questions . SLATER : Uh-huh . Poking around and asking questions . An insurance agent . What kind of a cheap trick ! All right , you , out ! I don 't understand . I said , out ! Sure . It 's a friend of Gilman 's . DAVID : Who are you ? Slater , County Attorney . Look , if you 're not out of here in ten seconds , you 're gonna find yourself under arrest for trespassing . The lady let me in . Sure , you lied to her . That may be . And she may have returned the favor . Mrs. Wilk . Mr. Slater . Oh , Mr. Vincent ... you may as well stop your snooping . Gilman killed him , and that 's all there is to it . Look , I killed him . Plead guilty and get it over with . Charlie , you didn 't kill a man . You destroyed an alien . Will you remember that ? Oh , that 's great ... but who 's going to believe it , huh ? How about you ? You think Fred Wilk was from some other planet , something like that ? Well , I have to admit ... There you are . How about , uh ... How about a plea of self-defense , something like that ? No . That plainclothesman , uh , Wiznofsky- - he saw you hit Wilk with a wrench . He could also say that Wilk didn 't have a weapon . What did he say to you ? What do you mean ? Well , he must 've said something to you before ... No , he didn 't say anything . Well , you just hit him ? Yeah , that 's right . Come on , I don 't believe you . I don 't care what you be ... Go on . Who needs you ? Get out of here ! Look , I stuck by you in Korea , I 'm going to stick by you now . So just cool down , huh ? Now , what about this , uh , Slater , the county attorney ? How long has he been here ? I don 't know . About a year , I guess . Only a year ? I understand he was a friend of Wilk 's . Hey , you think he 's an alien ? Well , they arrived at the same time . He could 've arranged to have himself assigned to this case . It 's possible . You 're not actually suggesting that Slater could be one of these ... invaders of yours ? Only suggesting . Maybe the judge , too , huh ? I doubt that . That 's why we waived the jury . We have a better chance of convincing one man than 12 unknowns and maybe a couple of ringers . Now , look , I 've sat here and listened to you two . I want to tell you something . I took this case only because Bill Cleary 's out of town , and , uh , Howard Mitchell is laid up with arthritis . I 'm not going to stand up in open court and claim that there are flying saucers or that kind of nonsense , and I am most certainly not going to accuse my colleague of being some sort of space monster . You don 't have to claim anything . Just ask the questions . When Wiznofsky gets finished telling his story , I may not have any questions to ask . And when we got inside the room , there was no sign of the victim . Gilman had already taken the body and ... Objection , Your Honor . SYMONDSON : Sustained . Confine your testimony to those things you actually witnessed . Yes , sir . All right , Sergeant Wiznofsky , was there any other entrance to the furnace room ? No . Was there , within the room , anyplace to dispose of a body ? Yes , sir . There was a large , open furnace . Was this furnace operative at the time ? I 'll say . It was going like a ... I was about to say " It was going like a blast furnace . " Your witness . No questions , Your Honor . The defense reserves the right to cross-examine . You may step down , Sergeant . Call your next witness , Mr. Slater . Mr. David Vincent . Do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you God ? I swear . Please state your name and occupation . David Vincent , architect . You 're a friend of the defendant , aren 't you ? Yes . Now , Mr. Vincent , on the afternoon of Mr. Wilk 's murder ... Uh ... disappearance . Very well . On the afternoon of Mr. Wilk 's disappearance , you were with Sergeant Wiznofsky at the window of the furnace room , were you not ? Yes . Now , you heard Sergeant Wiznofsky 's testimony as to what occurred ? Yes . Was his account correct ? Yes , it was . Then you did see the defendant raise the pipe wrench and strike Mr. Wilk on the head with it ? DAVID : Yes , but Mr. Wilk did not die . You saw him alive again afterwards ? No . You never saw him again , did you , Mr. Vincent ? No . What you did see was Mr. Wilk fall to the floor , and when you entered the room , the body was gone , and there was an open blazing furnace . That correct ? As far as it goes . Yes or no , Mr. Vincent ? Yes . Your witness . Your Honor , I 'd like to make a statement . Your Honor , Mr. Vincent is not a defendant in this case nor is he an attorney . I think it 's very important . It 's slightly irregular , Your Honor . David : That 's just my point , Your Honor . This entire case is slightly irregular . You may make your statement , Mr. Vincent , but , uh , try and keep it brief as possible . Yes , I did see Charlie hit Mr. Wilk over the head with that pipe wrench . Ask Charlie himself . He 'll say he did it . However , I understand the definition of murder is the killing of another human being . Fred Wilk was not a human being . SYMONDSON : This court will recess for one half hour . ( gavel banging ) Mr. Vincent , I 'd like to see you in my chambers . Slater , Bernard , you , too . Mr. Vincent , I hope I don 't have to remind you that a man 's life is at stake here . Your Honor , I 'm aware of that . I trust this wasn 't your idea , Mr. Bernard . No , sir . I told both the defendant and Mr. Vin ... He had nothing to do with it . Charlie saw Fred Wilk disintegrate . Now , that may not prove that he was a creature from another planet , but it certainly indicates he wasn 't human . If that 's what he saw . He saw that . Mr. Vincent , are you asking us to ... All right , all right , gentlemen ! Let 's not try the case here . Your Honor , I don 't know exactly what the defense has in mind , but it certainly looks as if they 're trying to turn this trial into a three-ring circus . We 're trying to prove what happened . That 's what we 're all here for , Mr. Vincent- - the truth . But I must warn you against any more grandstanding . Your Honor , we must have a certain latitude . Latitude , Mr. Vincent , not license . Yes , sir . That 's all , gentlemen . I 'm sorry , Your Honor . I realize you 're in quite a spot . I 'm afraid I don 't see it . Well , not if you find Gilman guilty , of course . The case will be decided on the evidence , Mr. Slater . Well , I 'm sure of that , Your Honor . But the way I heard it , you 're being considered for the state Supreme Court . What 's your point ? If this trial goes another day , the newspapers will have a picnic . A barbecue . Well , can 't you just see the governor appointing a man who , in effect , had announced his belief in little green Martians ? Get out , Slater . Just let Symondson do the judging . You know , I 've got a reputation to protect . I just can 't ... What about Charlie Gilman 's life ? Excuse me . I would like to know why you 're doing this . Doing what ? Smearing my husband 's memory . Look , lady , what I said in court about your husband is true . You know it isn 't . Maybe you have reason for denying it . Yes . I have every reason . He was my husband . That 's not what I meant . Maybe you had the same reason he had for hiding the truth . You were pretty rough on her . Why not ? She was married to an alien . She 's probably one herself . I wish I could make up my mind . About what ? Whether I 'm handling a case that 'll make history or whether I 'm being sucked in by a couple of kooks . Maybe I 'm the victim of a giant put-on . Well , you don 't have to worry about that . As I said before , let Symondson do the judging . It 's his job . You may cross-examine , Mr. Bernard . Now , Miss Cole , you testified that the defendant entered the restaurant where you worked , walked over to the table where Mr. and Mrs. Wilk were sitting , and without any provocation , physically assaulted Mr. Wilk . Well , not exactly . What do you mean , " not exactly " ? I mean , that 's not exactly how I said it , but that 's how it happened okay . And you 're absolutely sure that Mr. Wilk didn 't do or say anything that might 've provoked the attack ? The only one that said anything at all was that one there . He said ... wait a minute , I want to get it right . Yeah ... he said , " I ought to kill you . " ( spectators murmuring ) Miss Cole , during the fight or after , did you see any blood on Mr. Wilk ? No . No further questions . I have one more question , Miss Cole . As many as you need . When did you stop watching the fight ? As soon as it started to get rough . I think that one , he picked up a glass , and I couldn 't look no more . I don 't like violence and that stuff , you know . No further questions . SYMONDSON : You may step down , Miss Cole . Mrs. Janet Wilk . You swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you God ? I swear . You are Mrs. Janet Wilk ? Yes . And the widow of the late Fred Wilk ? I am . I 'll have to ask you to speak up a little , Mrs. Wilk . Yes , sir . How long were you and Mr. Wilk married ? 11 months . And you have one child- - an infant . Yes . Now , Mrs. Wilk , you were present in the courtroom during the testimony of Sergeant Wiznofsky and Miss Cole , weren 't you ? I was . Was Miss Cole 's account of the fight between your husband and the defendant an accurate description of that encounter ? Yes . Did you hear the defendant say " I ought to kill you " ? Mrs. Wilk ? Yes , I heard him . SLATER : Well , now , Mrs. Wilk , do you know of any reason why the defendant , Charles Gilman , should attack your husband either that night at the restaurant on or on the day of his death ? Do you , Mrs. Wilk ? Well ... before I moved here ... before I met Fred ... Go on . Before that , Charlie and I were engaged for three years . SLATER : You were engaged to the defendant in this case ? MRS. WILK : Yes . And then we had a big fight , and I moved here to Lincoln City . And about a year later , Charlie came , too . But by that time , I 'd already married Fred ... and Charlie ... Well , Charlie didn 't like that much . Ask for a recess . Your Honor ... this testimony comes as something of a surprise . I should like a few moments to consult with my client . This court will recess for 15 minutes . All right , let 's hear it . What ? The whole story . You just heard it . From you . Well , it , uh ... it was like she said . We had a fight , she moved here , I took it for about a year , then I followed and , uh ... she was already married to Wilk , had a kid and ... and that 's it . Why didn 't you tell us that ? I don 't know . Well , maybe I know . Maybe you just wanted me here for an elaborate cop-out . Maybe Wilk was as human as you or I. Maybe you did throw him into the furnace . Well , if that 's what you want to believe , pal , you go right ahead . That 's not what I believe , Charlie , but why didn 't you say something ? Now they 've established a motive . Then change the plea to guilty . That 's what they 're going to come up with , anyway . Why did you kill him ? Because ... because he was an alien . You didn 't know he was an alien when you started that fight in the restaurant . Oh , look , I ... I had a couple of drinks . I was feeling sorry for myself . I don 't know ... maybe I was thinking about Janet . I don 't know ! Were you thinking about her when you killed him ? What did he say to you before you hit him ? I don 't remember . You don 't remember . Was it about Janet ? Come on , was it about Janet ? Yes , it was about Janet . Now get off my back ! I 'm guilty . We can still fight this if we can prove Wilk was an alien . No ! Maybe Brennan will come up with something . Look , don 't you understand ? I killed a man . What are you talking about ? Wilk was a man . They 're about ready to reconvene . We 'll be there . Judge Symondson ... We 'll be there ! Now say it again for me . I wanted to kill him . And at that very moment , he could have been a man , but I didn 't even think about that . I just wanted to kill him ! But he was an alien . Yeah . That 's the point . Are you still in love with her ? ( soft chuckle ) She married another guy . Did I ask you that ? Well , what if I am ? Wait a minute ... I have a question . If Wilk was one of your aliens , why would he marry her ? I mean , what for ? I don 't know . Part of his cover . You sure you 're not riding your own horse , Mr. Vincent ? What is that supposed to mean ? I want him to defend himself , so I can prove there are aliens here on Earth ? Something like that . I don 't know , that may be part of it . If only we could prove what we 're trying to prove . Terrific . How do we do it ? Fred Wilk has lived here for the last year . He had a job , family , friends ... he was an active member of the community . All we have to do is prove he never existed . Look , I 'm not interested in how much he earned . All I want to find out is if he filed a federal return . Yeah ... anytime before last year ... Right ... thanks . ( flips switch ) Sorry , Alec . Now , any service record , or if not , why not ? Soon . Yesterday would be nice . I got a murder trial going . Get me David Vincent . I 'll see . Just a moment . Oh , Mr. Vincent ... telephone . Thank you . Hello . Vincent ... Fred Wilk may have lived before last year , but he sure hasn 't proved it to me . He hasn 't even come close . Well , he doesn 't have to prove he did . We have to prove he didn 't . I might even be able to help you out there , Mr. Vincent . How much time I got ? Until 7 : 00 . Now , get on it , will you , please ? Was this Charlie 's idea my testifying for the defense ? No . It was mine . He didn 't like the idea . Thought it would embarrass you . It will . Worse things can happen . Look , Mr. Vincent , this isn 't Perry Mason . You want me to go in there and save him . Well , I can 't do that . Charlie killed a man . Maybe not the nicest guy in the world ... maybe not the greatest husband ... but a man . We don 't think so . It 's Charlie I don 't think is much of a man . He swears he loves me , then he takes the first freight out of town . He resents my marrying Fred , so he beats him up ... and that 's not enough ... and he kills him ... and he lies . He lies about everything that 's happened . Well , he told me something this morning that I believe . What ? He loves you . And you believe him ? Do you believe anything he says ? Every word . I swear to you , every word is God 's truth . Your witness . Mr. Gilman , this man that you admit to killing ... Objection ! He does not admit to killing a man . Sustained . This thing that you killed- - this being ... this ... do you mind if we call him Fred Wilk ? All right . You worked in the same plant with him , didn 't you ? Yes . Mm-hmm . Along with 400 other people . Yes . Where you were the only one who claimed that he wasn 't human . Yes . But of course , you knew him better than they did , didn 't you ? I mean , you knew him socially . He married your old girlfriend , didn 't he ? Yes . And that 's why you killed him . Why doesn 't mean anything . He wasn 't a human being . Oh , come on , Mr. Gilman . He breathed , didn 't he ? He ate . He cried , he laughed , he walked , he talked , and he wasn 't human ? No . He was a father , Mr. Gilman . He had a child , and yet you claim he wasn 't human . Now , how can that be ? Will you please explain that to me ? How can that be ? He was not a human being . No further questions . BERNARD : Janet Wilk to the stand , please . May I remind you , Mrs. Wilk , you 're still under oath . Mrs. Wilk ... Yes ? How long were you married to Fred Wilk ? Um , a little under a year . And how long had you known him before you were married ? Only a few weeks . What do you know about his past , uh , before you met him ? Well , nothing . As far as I know , he never existed before I met him . And your ... marriage- - how would you characterize it ? My marriage was not good . In what respect ? Well ... He never touched me . He never wanted to . Why ? Had he no human desires ? No human drives ? Your Honor , I object . The use of the word " human " in this context ? Overruled . A wife is a better judge of her husband 's behavior than a lawyer . SYMONDSON : I 'm , uh , sorry to disappoint you in that regard , Mr. Slater . Answer the question , Mrs. Wilk . No human desires . None whatever . Why do you think that Fred Wilk- - to all outward appearances a man , a normal human being- - could not have , uh , relations with you ? Your Honor , objection . It hasn 't been established that he could not . All that 's been said is that he did not . Sustained . There was something cold ... almost ... inhuman . ( scoffs ) Objection , Your Honor . If the question at bar is was a man a man , you don 't call him inhuman . Sustained . And , Your Honor , I must object to the spectacle of a wife assassinating her husband 's memory after he 's dead . SYMONDSON : overruled and out of order . ( banging gavel ) BERNARD : Did you tell Charles Gilman the defendant ... Did you express to him your feelings that your husband was not ... what you expected him to be ? Yes , sir , I had . Mrs. Wilk , what do you think ? Was Fred Wilk a human being or was he not ? I wish I knew . You may cross-examine . All right , Mrs. Wilk ... you 've been telling us that in some respects , your ... your husband was not a human being- - not a normal man . Yes , sir . Are you a normal woman ? I believe so . Married 11 months ? Yes , sir . And you have a son ? Yes , sir . Who 's four months old . Yes , sir . Well , then are we correct in assuming , Mrs. Wilk , that your husband- - your late husband- - is not the father of this child ? Yes , sir . Well , will you please tell us , Mrs. Wilk , who is ? Objection ! Immaterial and irrelevant . Would , uh , Counsel approach the bench ? You raised this line of questioning , Mr. Bernard , and I 'm inclined to let prosecution pursue it . On the other hand , I don 't want to cause this woman needless humiliation . I 'll require an answer if it 's relevant to the case . I believe it 's very relevant , Your Honor . It 'll further establish motive , and it 'll cast doubt on the credibility of this witness . You 're impeaching your own witness , Mr. Slater . I realize that , Your Honor . Very well . Objection overruled . Proceed , Mr. Slater . Thank you , Your Honor . All right , Mrs. Wilk , who is the father ? Charles Gilman . SLATER : The defendant . You were in love with him . I was . And still are ? Yes . SLATER : So you never loved your husband . In fact , you were pregnant when you married him . Probably never encouraged him . Do you really blame him for not having relations with you ? He ... he couldn 't . You wanted him to be a normal husband . Were you a normal wife ? I guess not . So , outside of your desire to protect the defendant , do you have any specific proof that Fred Wilk was not what he seemed to be- - a man ? No , sir . No further questions . Janet ... I 'm sorry . I 'm not . I told Mr. Vincent I 'd be embarrassed to go up there and say those things ... but I wasn 't ... not a bit . Did it help ? It 's a start . Telephone call for Mr. Vincent . BERNARD : Defense calls John Lovell . Hello ? BRENNAN : Vincent , I 've got it . Now , I can 't guarantee that Fred Wilk was card-carrying member of outer space , but he sure wasn 't Fred Wilk . Birth certificate , fingerprints , Social Security- - none of it adds up . No mistakes ? No mistakes . How long will it take you to get here ? They 're flying it down from the state Capitol . Keep the trial going till 7 : 00 . I 'll meet you in the parking lot . Nice going , Brennan . Be careful . SLATER : So , Mr. Lovell , the fact that there was no trace of a human being in the ashes is not conclusive ? Thank you very much , Mr. Vincent . LOVELL : I only testified that there is no evidence a man burned up . I drew no conclusions . SLATER : Well , when a man burns in a furnace , can science establish it with certainty ? LOVELL : Usually . SLATER : Usually ... but not always . So that it 's entirely possible that a human being- - Fred Wilk , say- - could be incinerated and yet leave no trace . Except for the trace of calcium . Many substances contain calcium . Including human beings . Including , among other things , human beings . No further questions . Oh ... this isn 't helping one bit . I can keep setting them up and Slater 's going to keep knocking them down . I 've got nothing to go on . Do you understand ? Just keep this thing going until 7 : 00 . Brennan found something ? Everything . Proof that Wilk was an alien ? Proof that he wasn 't Fred Wilk . Oh , that 's not enough . Our defense is that Charles didn 't kill a man . Now , the best this can do is to establish that he killed a different man . Now , listen to me- - you 're paying me for advice . My advice is to try and make a deal . Say that Fred Wilk was a man . But he wasn 't a man . Say he was . Make a deal with them , Charlie . Get off with your life . Have you concluded your case , Mr. Bernard ? No deal . Right ? Right . Your Honor , may we have a continuance till 7 : 00 p.m. ? On what grounds ? A key witness , I believe . SLATER : Well , Your Honor ... if the defense isn 't ready , the prosecution is . We have a key witness ourselves . All right , Mr. Bernard ? All right , Your Honor . The People call Mr. Fred Wilk , Sr. No ... What is this ? I don 't know . Name and address ? Fred Wilk , Sr. Rural Free Delivery number three , Omaha , Nebraska . Do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you God ? I do . Mr. Wilk ... is this a picture of your son ? My natural son- - born July 7 , 1933 . I ask that this be marked and introduced into evidence . Now , Mr. Wilk , just two questions . Are you his father ? I am . I , uh , took the liberty of bringing along his birth certificate . And ... where 's his mother ? Stand up , Mother . No further questions . You may cross . No questions . SLATER : Your Honor , in view of this conclusive evidence that the murder victim , Fred Wilk , Jr . , was a man , a whole man and nothing but a man , the prosecution respectfully moves for a directed verdict of guilty on all charges and specifications . Who sent you here ? A friend of the cause , Mr. Vincent . You 'd better come with me . I 'm afraid we can 't , David . Say , Mr. Vincent ... I 'd say we 've kind of got you by the ears . What would you say ? They 're all over the place- - Mr. Fred Wilk , Sr. , the district attorney . You can 't stop them and I can 't stop them . Listen , it 's almost 7 : 00 . Brennan will be here any minute . Brennan 's not going to save me . Look , they can 't cover forever . We 'll find something out . We 're going to Omaha- - check RFD number three ... And prove what ? That Fred Wilk , Sr. , never existed ? Now , you listen to me . I 'm running out of time . I want that attorney down here now . I want to make a deal . It 's my life ! Charlie , I know that . I need a little more time . ( snorts ) You know , you never knew in the army how scared I was of dying , did you ? Nightmares for three whole years in Korea . I thought I was over that . You want to know what I dreamed last night ? I 'll talk to the lawyer . Yeah . Let me talk to Brennan first . Hi , pretty . Hi . Brennan ... you 're a lifesaver . All right , what did Brennan have for us ? A cerebral hemorrhage . He 's dead . ( incredulous sigh ) So , that 's how they do it . That 's how . Who knew he was coming ? I don 't know . You said something in court about a key witness at 7 : 00 . Well ... that 's that . Charlie wants to make a deal . What can you do for him ? Well , I don 't think they 'll take self-defense . Voluntary manslaughter , maybe ... murder in the second . We could try temporary insanity . Yeah , it sounds that way , doesn 't it ? The whole world is nuts and everyone in it . Well , I 'll get together with the judge and Slater in his chambers ... see what they 'll do for us . Listen , whatever you do , make sure you get two guarantees- - make sure he gets off with his life ... Of course . And try to keep the door open . I don 't care how long it takes , I 'm going to find proof , and when I do , I want him set free . I 'll try . Okay . I 'll tell him . ( sighs ) It could mean 20 years in jail or ... or an insane asylum someplace . I don 't know . It doesn 't matter . We 're together now . It 's right . We 're right . What 's the matter ? Bernard 's making a deal right now . Brennan came up empty , huh ? He 's dead . They killed him . I found him outside in his car . What about the evidence ? Whoever killed him took it . I 'd like to know what Slater was doing about then . You think Slater killed him ? It 's a good guess . Well , maybe your lawyer saw him . Bernard ? Well , yes , I saw him coming in from the parking lot when I was coming up here . Are you sure ? Yes . He was carrying some envelopes- - papers or something . Guard ! We were just talking about you , Mr. Vincent . Come in . We 've been trying to see our way clear to a compromise in this case . Yes , sir . When one man maintains a lie in the face of the evidence , he 's probably demented , but two men ... I have to ask myself , " Is it a conspiracy ... an attempt to evade justice ? " Now , these gentlemen may suggest a compromise . I have to approve it , but I won 't until I understand why you and the defendant told such an improbable story . ( sighs ) May I ? Help yourself . ( glass shattering ) I 'm sorry . I ... I must be nervous . Your Honor ... what if I do believe all this ? What if I believe there are alien beings here on Earth who have no pulse , no heartbeat ... who feel no pain ? You believe it ? Is that what you 're saying ? I 'll leave that to you . Maybe there aren 't aliens here on Earth , but people who don 't bleed when they 're cut . SYMONDSON : Stop that man ! Hold it ! Hold it ! Stop or I shoot ! Did you see him burn ? Just like they said . All rise . Be seated . CLERK : Will the defendant rise , please ? Because of the unusual aspects of this case , Mr. Slater has agreed to move for a dismissal of the charge on ground of insufficient evidence . SYMONDSON : Motion granted . Case dismissed . Say , Vincent ... you know something ? For a minute there , I was almost afraid I was going to be your next slashing victim . Well , I had thought about it . You really thought that Slater here was one of your aliens ? For a while , Judge . You should 've asked me . He was a student of mine in law school . And one of your best , huh , Judge ? Right . ( chuckling ) But I never did like him . It 's been an interesting couple of days . It sure has . Let 's see , the last time you said that was , um ... Inchon Landing . Next time I call , you won 't head the other way ? No . More than likely , I 'll call you . You know they 're here now ... the judge , Slater ... I may ask all three of you to prove my case . Well , we 'll be there . You know , I like that judge , Charlie . Do you think he 'd perform the ceremony ? I don 't know . I don 't know why not ... if you two can pass the blood test . ( chuckles ) See you . NARRATOR : Three more witnesses to testify on David Vincent 's behalf when he has his day in court- - when he presents his case to the authorities proving the existence of alien invaders .

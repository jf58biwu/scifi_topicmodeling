 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . [ Beeping ] It 's a control complex of some kind . But where ? And when ? Well , if it 's Earth , we must be a hundred - maybe hundreds of years into the future . Photon electronics . This equipment 's as far ahead of us as we 're ahead of Newton . About 300 years . That would put us ahead in time until ... the year 2268 . [ Rumbling ] What was that , an earth tremor ? I don 't know . Could be . We 'd better find out who runs this complex before they find us . [ Laser Firing ] [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . Did it get you too ? - Sort of a paralysis . - Yes . [ Speaking Alien Language ] We don 't understand you . We mean no harm . Who are you ? What is this place ? You are now ... in a translation circuit . You are intruders ... from another dimension . - From which planet do you come ? - We 're from the planet Earth . We did not know ... you had the capacity ... for teleportation . We 're time travelers . We landed here completely by accident . That is of no concern to us . Test them ... against our remote data ... on the composition of Earth beings . - Stay . - We 'd better do as he says . [ Frequency Beeps ] Muscle and bone structure ... corresponds to our remote data . Internal organs same . Glandular system same . All present physical data ... corresponds to our remote data . Well , now that you know all about us ... who are you ? We are from Alpha 1 ... operating under space directive Lentos ... for a test raid ... against primitive Planet 1 - 6 . Our terminology is different . Can you show us Planet 1 - 6 ? Our landing is imminent . Tony . They 're going to attack Earth . - Tell him to resume his position . - Get back . We haven 't got a chance against them , not here . We can 't let them do it . [ Laser Firing ] Resistance ... is impossible . You said you were time travelers . Yes . That 's how we got aboard your spacecraft . From which Earth year ... do you come ? 1 968 . Then you are in ... your early stage of development . You have brought with you no capability ... to resist our invasion . We have a few space weapons that might surprise you . For example ? We 're already in the technology of time . Our being here proves that . That was a primitive teleportation . Observe . We of Lentos ... have passed far beyond you . - Do you accept this ? - Yes . [ Laser Firing ] You are now under restraint . We are now ... entering atmosphere . - I can 't move . - Neither can I. What do you suppose their plan of attack is going to be ? I don 't know . But I do know one thing - that somebody 's air force is gonna be swarming all over us ... as soon as we get in close . What are they doing now ? [ Whirring ] They seem to be taking on some sort of electrical charge . Take the controls out of automatic , Taureg . You speak our language more fluently now . This was programmed ... on Alpha 1 for our use . We know your language ... your customs , all about you . Then you also know you won 't be able to take over the Earth without a fight . We come from a hungry planet ... where all protein was exhausted ... centuries ago . As a matter of survival , we raid other planets ... and extract the protein from them ... for our own people . - What happens to these planets you raid ? - They don 't concern us . Our only morality is survival . If necessary , when we leave the Earth ... we will leave no life on it . It will be ... a dead planet . Why , it 's impossible . Check the circuits . The circuits are all go . That 's a true image . - I still don 't believe it . - We don 't have any choice . We have to believe it . That spaceship is there , and Tony and Doug must be on it . But it 's impossible . We don 't even have a time fix . - That 's incredible . - No , it 's not so incredible , Ray . There have been reports of unidentified flying objects all the way back to the Bible . Yes , that 's true . You check with the computer , and you 'll see I 'm right . But nobody was able to prove they existed . Not until now . - Can you fix the location ? - Approximately . They 're landing at longitude 1 1 2 degrees west , latitude 34 degrees north . That will put them in Arizona . Ann , get me the Arizona surveys , please . Yes , sir . We have studied the Earth from a distance ... and know its vulnerable points . From this moment on ... you exist only as a convenience to us . - We won 't help you . - On other planets ... we have learned that there are three alternatives . Some of the inhabitants cooperate willingly . These are most valuable to us . Others have to be converted into creatures ... who can be controlled . If an inhabitant cannot be controlled ... he is destroyed . Have you located our primary test objective ? No . I am scanning the terrain . What year is this ? This is the Earth year 1 885 . The primary test objective has been located . [ Rooster Crowing ] [ Horse Whinnying ] What 's goin ' on here ? - What kind of crackpots are you ? - Destroy him . No , wait ! Destroy him , and you destroy yourselves . Your programming is incomplete , or you 'd know what kind of people you 're up against . You start by killing , and these people ... will destroy everything they have before you can get to it . Very well . You are wise to cooperate with us . Still , I want you to know our power . [ Laser Firing ] - Are there other humans in the house ? - No . [ Laser Firing ] You will stand where you are . By authority of space directive Lentos 1 - 6 ... you will now consider yourself my prisoner . This is now Test Base 1 , Alpha 1 . What kind of nonsense you talkin ' ? All of you , get off my property ! Get out ! Cooperate with him , please . I 'll explain it all to you later . - Not later - now ! - Your house will be turned over to us . You will likewise gather up all livestock , grain , foodstuffs . They will be turned over to us as well . The Apaches run off my stock . The drought ruined my crops . I 've had a bellyful , mister . Now , you 've got one minute to get off my place . Take him into the house . You will remember , there is no possible escape . You ! Stay . That 's your conditioning , isn 't it ? To kill anybody who gets in your way . We kill only when it is necessary . We keep you alive to work for us ... just as we will spare other lives to help us gather the protein material . Have you located the second test objective ? Yes . The name of the town is Mullins . Mullins , Arizona , U.S.A. [ Alien # 1 ] You will go into that town to deliver an ultimatum . In one hour , unless a delegation of leaders comes here to meet with us ... I will destroy part of that town . And suppose they do come ? What then ? The town will be turned over to us complete ... with all edible protein intact . The leaders will comply with that order . I can 't guarantee that they 'll do anything like that . - And an hour isn 't enough time . - It will be enough . Further , if you have not returned here within two hours ... the humans here will be destroyed . The time begins now . Well , how do I find the town ? You will ride due east until you come to a road . You will follow the road south into the town . Now . Well , get down to the saloon and tell him again . - Sheriff . - Just a minute . You tell him there 's one company of cavalry standing between those Apaches and this town . - Yes , sir . - Now , what can I do for you ? Sheriff , this town is being threatened . I appreciate your interest , but the army warned us about the Apaches three days ago . - We 've evacuated the women and children - - I 'm not talking about Indians . - Go on . - There 's a ranch north of here run by a tall , white-haired man . - Jess Crawford . I know the place . - It 's been taken over by two raiders . They 're holding Crawford and a friend of mine . They 've sent me here to bring back the leaders of the town . - What do they want with us ? - They want the immediate surrender of this town . Otherwise , they 're gonna destroy part of it as proof of their powers . Now , these are not just two men . They 're supernatural creatures . Believe me , they have the powers to do what they 've threatened . - And they 're supernatural creatures ? - I know how that sounds . You know what I think , mister ? I think you 're out of your mind . Sheriff , I don 't know how to convince you - You couldn 't convince me if you had witnesses ! Now get out of here . - I got enough trouble on my hands . - Where 's the telegraph office ? The Indians cut the lines two days ago . Oh , and one more thing , mister . You panic this town any more than it 's already panicked , I 'm gonna throw you in that jail . Now get out ofhere . I have an approximate location . As near as I can tell , they 're in the town of Mullins , Arizona . I have the computer study on unidentified flying objects . Thank you . [ Chuckles ] According to Look magazine for October , 1 966 ... a couple saw and entered a flying saucer . The same magazine reported that more than 60 people saw a flying saucer ... near Kensington , New Hampshire , on September 3 , 1 965 . Life magazine on April 1 , 1 966 ... published a picture of an unidentified flying object ... taken at Perth , Australia . You know , there have been literally hundreds of sightings ... of U.F.O. ' s in the past few years ... by sober , responsible , intelligent people . Enough of them so that the air force is subsidizing ... an independent university study of the subject . Well , General , is there any mention in there ... of Mullins , Arizona , during 1 885 ? Nope . Nothing . How can something like this happen ... and not leave a trace of a report ? Maybe nobody saw the spaceship land . Maybe it was interpreted differently . I don 't know . Ann , run Mullins , Arizona , through the computer , please . - See what you can find . - Yes , sir . How much time has passed since the aliens issued their ultimatum ? Almost an hour . I am tellin ' y 'all , the cavalry 's gone to fight them Apaches at Smith 's Flat ... and I 'm tellin ' y 'all , there ain 't enough soldiers to hold ' em back . Now , if we don 't get some men together here and take to the field ... them Indians are gonna run all over us . I say we give ' em a few beeves , buy ' em off . I need some men to go with me to the Crawford ranch . He 's in trouble . The Apaches ? [ Explosion ] Get to the firehouse ! Freeze , mister . I don 't know what kind of game you 're playin ' , but it 's over now . Look , Sheriff , I 'm not playing any game . And neither are those aliens . You can see that for yourself . Now , we 'd better get to the Crawford ranch before they kill those two men . You 're not goin ' anyplace . Sam ! - Lock him up , Sam . - But I 've gotta get - - And see he stays put ! - All right , mister . Move . I have Control . [ Male Alien Voice ] Report , Alpha 1 . Primary test base established . Secondary test base under attack . Your test will be completed within eight hours . You will then report landing coordinates ... to the rest of the raiding fleet . It will be done . Now , listen . Their whole control system ... the heart of their power , is in that weird gun . - We have to find a way to destroy it . - How can I trust you ? - If your friend hadn 't stopped me , I could 've - - Yes . Yes , you would 've been killed right there on the spot . You got any ideas how to destroy the gun ? I think so . You give me one minute to get out the front door and around the side of the house ... - and then you fire this shotgun . - What good will that do ? The only advantage we have over them is unpredictability . If they hear a gunshot , one of them will have to come in here to investigate . Tell him it was an accident . Tell him anything . The other one may be distracted long enough to give me a chance at that gun . - And then what do you want me to do ? - Just stall for time . But no matter what happens , stay here . All right . I 'll give you one minute . Good luck . [ Laser Firing ] He 's dead . - The human is very resourceful . We can use him . - Yes . It 's time to change him . You will take care of it . Any luck , Ray ? - Not yet . - I may have something . The jail is still standing . It 's part of the Mullins Ghost Town National Monument . - Ghost town ? - Yes . It was abandoned in 1 885 . Completely deserted for no apparent reason . It 's still a mystery what happened to the town . Perhaps that 's why there was never a report from there about unidentified flying objects . I have the feeling we 're about to see that mystery solved . Well , this could do it . We can locate the jail geographically . All we have to do is hope that Tony will stay put until we can get him out . [ Clicking Switches ] - Look , I 've got to get out of here ! - Not a chance , friend . Sheriff told me to keep you here and watch you , and that 's just what I 'm gonna do . Your sheriff sure doesn 't like reporters , does he ? I 'm only trying to do my job . Say , are you really a reporter ? Work for the Harper 's Weekly . They sent me out to cover the Indian scare . - Well , I 'll be . - I 'll tell you what . You let me out to cover the fire , I 'll give you five dollars . Uh-uh , friend . Not a chance . What about if you get the facts for me and let me write them down as they happen ? There can 't be any harm in that . Well , I guess not . But when would I get that five dollars ? As soon as I get the story . I 'm gonna need some , uh , paper and a pencil . All right . My name 's Sam . Sam Colt . There ain 't a chance in the world of you spelling ' that wrong . One thing though . The sheriff s not to know about this . He wouldn 't take kindly to me giving a prisoner extra privileges . You can count on me . [ Sheriff ] The fire 's gonna burn itself out if the wind don 't shift . We 'll keep the men handy though just in case . [ Man ] You got any idea how it started ? I got a good idea how it started . - Get back to your saloon . I 'll see you later . - All right , Sheriff . Let it drop . I said drop it ! Let 's go . You 're coming with me . What 's the point ? You can get away by yourself . I need you . We have a long ride ahead of us , Sheriff . Look , mister . You take me out of this town that needs every man it 's got ... I 'm gonna kill you first chance I get . Move out . Come on ! Move ! All right , hold it . Mister , you 're out of your mind with all this talk about superhuman creatures . - Come on . Keep moving . - [ Indians Whooping ] - Wait a minute . - [ Whooping Continues ] Mister , I don 't think you 're gonna have a chance to show me anything . Let 's have a look at this . [ Gunfire In Distance ] That 's Smith Flats down there , mister ... and that 's the last company of cavalry between those Apaches and the town . You 're only condemning everybody in that town to death by not coming with me . All right , hold it right there . I said hold it , Sheriff ! . Mister , you can shoot me if you want . But if you do , you 're gonna bring ... every one of those Indians right down on top of both of us . You 're coming back to the Crawford ranch with me . No , I 'm not . There 's nobody protecting that town now ... and I 'm not gonna see it overrun ... by a bunch of Apaches to go riding cross-country with a madman . The leaders would not come , even after the example ? When you blew up those buildings ... they thought I did it . - Then they will not cooperate ? - No . You will accompany us to assist in their persuasion . Prepare the projector . What 's going on ? Where 's Crawford ? He had to be destroyed . - What ? - He attacked them . They are not the evil creatures we thought they were . Doug , you should see what they 've done to that town . They gave them warning first . - What 's the matter with you ? - You will stand here . When I speak , you will obey immediately . You will make the transfer now . They slaughtered the cavalry , I tell ya . I saw it . The cavalry provoked them . You all know that . We fight , they 'll slaughter us too . But if we 're reasonable and give them what they want ... we 're - [ Laser Firing ] This town is now the property of Alpha 1 . I want all livestock within 1 0 Earth miles ... and all the protein material in town . Who is in command here ? I 'm the sheriff here . You will be wise to cooperate with them , Sheriff . Johnson drew on them first . - That 's a fact . - Shut up , Williams . Before I cooperate with these strangers ... I wanna know why they burned a quarter of this town . And where 's Crawford ? They went to his ranch in peace . He attacked them . They had to defend themselves . Jess Crawford never attacked a man unless he was attacked first . He was the slowest man to anger I know . You did set off that explosion , didn 't you ? Those who cooperate will not be harmed . The sheriff don 't speak for all of us . We don 't want any trouble here . This town 's in trouble already with the Apaches . We 'll do anything you ask . Those who cooperate will be protected . Those who resist will be destroyed . I want all protein materials . You will provide them . This is my place , and you 're welcome to it . Anything I can do . - Do you have food here ? - Yes . You will bring all protein material here immediately . Yes , sir . Right away . Anything you say . You will stay here . You will see to it ... that everyone moves all the food into the streets for collection . Remember , we still hold your friend as hostage . Go ! They 've taken his mind away . - Ann , haven 't you got those locations yet ? - We 've just gotten them . - When do we get the plans ? - We 're feeding them into the computer by remote . We should have them within five minutes . There . That 's everything I have . I told you I 'd cooperate , but the proof s in the pudding as I always say . It 's all there - everything complete . [ Doug ] Are you sure that 's everything ? [ Williams ] Oh , I wouldn 't lie to you . Is he telling the truth ? Oh , no , no , no . ! No , he 's lying . He 's lying ! He 's - No ! No ! I sense he is one of those humans ... whose fear can be useful to us . Bring the rest of it . Oh , please . I 'm cooperating with you . You can see that . But leave me something . Move back ! You 're running out , Sheriff ? I thought you were crazy before , mister . I gotta apologize to you for that . Indians are one thing , but these - these creatures , they 're another thing . There 's nothin ' I can do about ' em here . I figured if I could get to Tucson , send a wire to Fort Whipple ... I might get the army after ' em . It 'll be too late by then . They keep gaining strength . They 've already made Doug one of them , and they 'll do the same thing ... to everyone else in this town unless we stop them now . You know a way to stop ' em ? Look , I 'm not sure , but I think that - that thing they carry keeps supplying power for them . What we have to do is find a way to get to it and destroy it . - Can the two of us do it ? - No , it 'll take three . They aren 't gonna harm us . Will you put that rifle down ! He 's one of them . Watch out ! [ Groans ] You were right . They gotta be stopped now . - We still need a third man . - We 'll get one . One thing . About your friend . If it comes down to the town or him , what do you do ? - The aliens have to be stopped . - All right . Is this the last of the herds ? Yes . We will have them placed in the proper coordinates . They will be sent to my planet . Activate and stand by . Activated and standing by . Now . [ Laser Firing ] I will leave them suspended for now . I must report the securing of the second test objective to Control . I don 't know , Sheriff . I agree with you something 's gotta be done . - But why me ? - You 've got no choice . None of us do . Well , I can clear out , hide . There 's no place to hide . We 'll be taking the bigger part of the risk . We 're asking you to serve as lookout , nothing more . - Well , all right . - Take this . Now , what 's your plan ? - Do you have any food ? - What ? Look , I need a reason for talking to the alien . I got a week 's supply of dried beef . Okay , that 'll do . And , remember ... when I get the alien away from that machine , you fire at it through the saloon window . - Can it be destroyed ? - We 'll soon find out . - What do you want me to do ? - Stay in the street . If you see the other alien coming , fire a warning shot . All right . - You set ? - Let 's go . - Do you have a fix on Tony ? - We 're locked on him and tracking , General . But I can 't locate Doug . Could they have killed him ? Give me a chance to get clear . But if you see I 'm not gonna make it , fire anyway . The important thing is to put that machine out of commission . I found some food that hasn 't been turned over to you . - [ Taureg ] Where ? - At thejail . It 's all protein . You will wait . I will investigate . This is Alpha 1 . [ Alien Voice ] We are awaiting your report , Alpha 1 . - It will be delivered soon . - Time is growing short . The signal will come as soon as Centauri returns . What do you want ? I can save you a lot of trouble . That 's what I can do . But what I figure is , one good turn always deserves another ... if you get my meanin ' . No bargains . Tell us what you know . They 're after that machine - the sheriff , the stranger . There . I helped you , didn 't I ? That proves something ; don 't it ? Look , I could 've warned them . I could 've betrayed you . I - Just let me go , please . Just let me go . That 's all I ask . Put the projector on the table . Not a chance . You 're helpless without this . The projector cannot save you . We 'll see about that . [ Alien Voice ] You are being monitored , Alpha 1 . What is happening ? Report . Now , you restore everyone to their original condition . That cannot be done without the projector . Return the projector to me ... and I will satisfy your demands . Smash that thing ! You all right ? - Yeah . - [ Speaking Alien Language ] They 've lost their power . They 're probably being brought back to the spaceship . Oh . Doug 's all right . - And the battle 's over . - We 'll try for a transfer . - Are they the same as - - No . Your alarm will not operate . - We are in control of this room . - What do you want here ? We come in peace ... to investigate the disappearance of one of our spaceships ... during Earth year 1 885 while on your planet . We have received a signal from your time machine ... that you have located it . We demand your cooperation . You have no right to demand anything . Computers - ancient . Data processors - primitive . Molecular electronics - entering elementary stage . Time control - early development . Our information is that you Earth beings ... have finally reached your moon . - What can we do ? - I don 't know . If that 1 885 spaceship was destroyed on Earth , will they retaliate ? They could destroy us . If our spaceship was destroyed on this planet ... this planet will be destroyed . We didn 't destroy it . We had nothing to do with its coming or going . The last we saw of your two beings , they were returning to their ship . Prove this to us - now . Prove it ? We 've told you the truth ! - Prove it ! - [ Thunderclap ] - Prove it . ! - How ? How can we ? You 've got to take our word for it . Ann , Ray , Mullins , Arizona . Get it on the image area . Same coordinates , same time . Everybody , back to your posts ! It 's our only hope . Hurry it up ! [ Thunderclap ] - Ray ! - We 're doing the best we can , General . We don 't seem to zero in on it . I demand proof now ! We 're trying ! Now ! Now ! I can 't ! I can 't ! Ray , keep at it ! Your spaceship - safely on its way . Now do you believe us ? It is our spaceship . We are satisfied ... that you have told us the truth . We frequently pass through your solar system ... but we no longer have a need for materials ... from primitive planets . Back to work , everybody . Well , they 're gone , and I don 't think ... you 'll have to worry about them coming back here . You bet I don 't . I 'm clearing out of here just like everybody else . As far as I 'm concerned , Mullins , Arizona , is a ghost town . You 're gonna make a report of what happened , aren 't you ? And have ' em call me loco ? No , sir . I 'm not gonna spoil my chances of getting another job . - Looks like World War I equipment . - [ Explosions In Distance ] The Alps . Northern Italy or Austria . - [ Shell Incoming , Explodes ] - Let 's get out of here . [ Explosions Continue ]

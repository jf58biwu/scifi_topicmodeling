 " Invasion Of The Astro-Monsters " ( Kaiju Daisenso ) In 196X , a mysterious planet was discovered beyond Jupiter . Earth launched an exploratory space ship . Fuji , try to contact WSA . Okay , Glen . Calling World Space Authority ... Calling World Space Authority . This is P-1 . This is P-1 . This is Space Authority , go ahead . Here are the P-1 's coordinates ... X-25.4 ... Y-3.30 ... Z-0.02 ... We are traveling at one-thousand kilometers per second . Time remaining in space is 23 : 59 : 34 . Your speed ... Correct it to 0.005 . That should do until later . Corrected speed is 0.005 . Good . How are you doing ? Is everything alright ? We 're eating and sleeping okay . We could do with some ground exercise , though . Well , you 'll get plenty of that on Planet X. Professor ... What is it ? Is Harone there with you ? Harone ? She 's not here . Could you give her a message please ? Tell her not to do anything foolish until I get back . Foolish ? Right ! Please tell her I don 't want her to do anything until I return ! Over and out ! What 's so funny ? Jeez , you 're a fine brother ! You don 't know her like I do . Thank you . What is Fuji so concerned about ? My brother doesn 't understand me at all . Fuji treats me like a child . Sometimes , he can be completely unreasonable . Oh , I 'm sorry ! What 's there to be worried about ? Is there someone that you like who your brother doesn 't approve of ? Yes . So , there you are ! We waited for you ! I 'm so sorry ! It 's alright . Doctor , everyone is waiting for you . I understand . This way , please . This friend of yours , what does he do ? He 's an inventor . An inventor ? Tetsuo , could you hold it down ? ! Please stop before the baby cries ! Mother , where did you hear it just now ? I could hear that thing if I were down the street ! She could really hear you , huh ? But , why can 't I find someone to buy you ? Tetsuo ! Tetsuo ! I 've already turned it off ! It 's the telephone ! I 'm sorry ! Mother is louder than my invention ! Thank you . You 're welcome . Hello ? Yes , this is Tetsuo Toori . Yes ... Huh ? ! A contract ? ! Professor Sakurai ... The newly discovered Planet X is just beyond the planet Jupiter , correct ? Yes . Why wasn 't it discovered before now ? The planet is very dark . We couldn 't find it with traditional telescopes . The planet was discovered by our central observatory while tracking strange radio waves . I believe it could be the reason behind the recent problems we 've had with our magnetic fields . Do you think there could be intelligent life there ? We 're not quite sure . The transmissions we received from space were not human . We 're hoping that the crew of Rocket P-1 will be able to give us more information . Tetsuo ... You asked me to come to this place . Are you alright ? The truth is , I sold the Lady Guard ! Oh ! Really ? Yes , I 'm signing the contract here ! Who bought it ? The World Education Corporation . They market toys for sale all over the world . What ? It 's not a toy . Not a toy ... ? Are you Tetsuo Toori ? Yes , I am . Sorry to keep you waiting . I 'm Namikawa from the World Education Corporation . Getting to business , here 's the standard contract we spoke about over the phone for payment to be made upon the marketing of your invention . Please look it over . It 's fine . Right ? Is this your wife ? Well , that is what I intend her to be . This is Hano Fuji . Pleased to meet you . You work for the Space Authority , right ? Your brother is a space pilot . Do you know my brother ? No , but we know he is very successful . We 're interested in how he deals with our current problem . Hey ... Doesn 't it seem strange ? What 's wrong ? The Lady-Guard ... Don 't you think it 's funny that they gave you 50,000,000 yen ? While space may keep you and your brother busy some of us are trying to earn a living from their ideas . I think you two underrate me ! You 're cruel ! You think I 'm cruel ? You 're brother thinks that I won 't amount to anything . If he saw what happened now , he would flip ! Hey Glen , isn 't something wrong here ? Strange ? Yes , I let the ship spin 180 degrees by mistake . Excuse me ... You ... ! Fuji , it 's Jupiter . Planet X is just beyond Jupiter . There 's Planet X. World Space Authority , this is P-1 . This is World Space Authority , go ahead . Rocket P-1 approaching Planet X. I want you to be careful . Of course . Can we explore the area after landing ? I can 't take you by the hand from here ! P - 1 any questions ? Do you understand ? We understand ... You sound just like a child 's father ! We 've lost contact . They 're entering the blind side of Jupiter . Glen , do you see anything yet ? No . That blue spot looks like a grass plain , but it could be the sea . Alright , let 's get ready . Check your readings . The radar-thermometer is reading fifteen degrees . Fifteen ? That 's pretty warm for this far from the sun . The ends of the universe still hold some secrets . Radiation ? None ! Okay ! Hey , is it okay ? It 's okay ! It 's fine ! Hey , Glen ... I 'll go place the flag on that ridge . Right . In the meantime , I 'll prepare the Telemeter . Fuji ... The gravity is two-thirds that of the earth 's , and the pressure is about half . The planet 's pressure is one-half ? Fuji , what the hell was that ? I think it was lightning . It 's strange to have lightning with no clouds . Is everything set there ? We 're all set . Alright ... Glen , I see footprints ! They 're not animal they 're human ! Glen ... What 's wrong , Glen ? ! Glen ! What happened , Glen ? ! Fuji , come this way . Step into the cylinder immediately . Who are you ? You must hurry . You are in great danger if you stay . Hurry into the cylinder now . Who are you ? ! We are what you would call , the life upon Planet X. Hurry inside . Glen and your Rocket P-1 have already been brought inside . Alright , I understand . Professor , we 've lost all contact with P-1 . Check the emergency channel ! It 's normal . I think it 's correct . Professor ... You 're worried ? I have faith in them . We haven 't lost a space pilot in over thirty years . It 's okay . Those two will call . Please follow the light . Go ahead ... Glen ! Glen ! Are you alright ? Are you ? I 'm fine . Good , remain where you are . We welcome you here . Please make yourself comfortable . I am the controller of this planet . Please hear what I must say . There is a reason why I brought you here . A reason ? What 's your reason ? Where is the P-1 ? You shouldn 't worry ... It is here , where it is perfectly safe . What 's wrong ? It 's the Monster Zero ! What ? Monster Zero ? Command all units to take defensive positions ! Understood ! What is Monster Zero ? A terrible space monster . We the people of Planet X , can no longer live on the surface . We must remain down here because of it . Monster Zero has started its attack ! At what point ? At 03-M7 ! 03-M7 ! Right ! I will show you Monster Zero . Glen , look ! It 's King Ghidorah ! Yes ... That is the name you have given it but our world designates everything by number . Why can 't you drive it away ? We were hoping you could teach us on how to repel it . We have tried every means available but every one has met with failure . What are you going to do now ? We just wait , until it leaves . Surface caving in at Sector 16 ! Move all defensive units to Sector 16 , and begin cleanup procedures . Controller ! Controller ! We have an emergency ! The hydrogen-dioxide plant has been damaged ! If this condition ... Something serious must have happened . And they don 't want us to know about it . Any country would do the same for secrecy . Hydrogen-dioxide ... Isn 't hydrogen-dioxide , water ? Yes , it 's water . You can relax . Monster Zero is gone . What was it that happened ? An industrial accident . We were concerned about their safety . Of course , we were concerned for you as well . Now , what else do you have to tell us ? We need an exterminator . In order to destroy King Ghidorah , we need Monster 01 and Monster 02 . Otherwise known as Godzilla and Rodan . Godzilla and Rodan ? Yes . The earth defeated King Ghidorah using the combined strength of Godzilla and Rodan . Will you help us ? Well the problem is , I 'm not sure we can help you obtain them . In the first place , we don 't know where Godzilla and Rodan are . Even if we did , how would we capture them and bring them here ? Godzilla is in Japan , in Lake Miojin . Rodan is in Washikazawa . We are asking for permission to operate on earth , so that we may capture them . Of course , we will give you a fair reward if earth decides on helping us . The earth has a disease you can not cure , known as cancer . We would give you the cure for this cancer in return for your assistance . Well then , please explain our situation on earth and help us obtain their cooperation . We understand . We 'll do everything that we can to convince them . I hope you do not fail us in our time of need . We pray for your safe journey . We 're glad that we could make new friends in space . Goodbye . P - 1 Returns From Planet X In any case you will agree that the report from Fuji and Glen is incredible . On the newly discovered planet there exists a race of people with advanced technology and medicines . Furthermore , they extended their hand of friendship to the people of the earth . It is our duty on the council to consider the proposal from Planet X so that we may make a proper decision . As for myself , the X-people have proposed to give us a formula that will cure cancer . I am very interested in what the possibilities could be if the earth made that drug cure more than cancer . We should not be hesitant . We have an obligation to open lines of exchange in space with the X-people . This planet wants to open relations with the earth . We should not treat them rudely . Those remarks signify that we are in agreement . This council will order to cooperate with the X-people provided that Godzilla and Rodan are where they claim . We have search units posted at both locations . Sorry to keep you waiting . Namikawa is out of town . Would you like to speak with me ? I was wondering about my invention the Lady Guard . Oh , we 're still examining that device . Still examining ? Is that what you are going to tell me again ? I 'd like to meet with your boss . Boss ... Is he gone ? No , he insists on seeing you . He 's an annoying pest . Well , get rid of him politely . As for his invention ... My brother is waiting to meet us . I don 't want to see him today . Don 't be too harsh ... The World Education Corporation will come through for you . Your sister 's late , huh ? She always late . So you can 't forgive the guy who stole her heart ? Coffee ... Don 't you have something else to do ? Actually , I 'm waiting for someone myself . A Japanese girl ? Not the wrong kind ? If you had to check on a girl 's past every time you went on a date , you 'd never fall in love . Speaking about checking out something , I can 't forget about that damaged H2O plant . I think Planet X is very short of water . I think so , too . I 'm also not quite sure about how much we can really trust them . Brother , sorry to keep you waiting . You 're late . Good evening , Glen . This way . Well Tetsuo , I heard you had good news about selling one of your inventions . Huh ... ? Yes ... The Lady Guard ... I was wondering why a company like that would pay so much for your invention . I haven 't been paid anything yet . That 's what I thought . I think very highly of my sister and I don 't know if you can make her happy . I understand . No , you shouldn 't agree , Tetsuo . Hey , Glen Isn 't the most important part of a relationship mutual trust ? I think so . Mutual trust is a beautiful thing . Glen , do you always have to interfere with me ? No , I 'm just stating a general fact ! Trust won 't buy groceries . True , but it 's necessary in everyday life ! Maybe , but you always side with the ladies ! Well , if you 'll excuse me ... Oh , do you have to go ? Yes , I have a date . The enemy is pretty powerful . You better do something spectacular ! Oh , it 's Namikawa ! Damn ! So they were lying to me , huh ? Glen is right ... You 'll have to do something spectacular for you two to change my mind . Brother ! What do we do now ? I 'll do something ... Although , I 'm not sure where I 'm going to start ... It 's increasing . Captain ! What ? What 's the matter ? Radiation levels are increasing . What ? ! Professor , did they find Godzilla ? Yes . The search party has confirmed that it 's at the bottom of the lake . So then , Rodan should be located where the X-people said it would be . Hey , what 's wrong ? You drive for a while . Hey Glen , how much longer until you tell me ? Doesn 't this road go to Lake Miojin ? Yes , this is the same way I went with the girl . Hey , this isn 't a true confession ? Wait a minute and listen . Seriously ... I think I saw that guy from Planet X. The controller ? From Planet X ? Yes ... The girl and I stayed overnight in a bungalow . In the middle of the night , I woke up and the controller was in the room . It was a dream ! That 's what I thought at first , but you know if it 's a dream when you wake up . Well , did he say anything ? He said that all the preparations were made and not to worry about anything . I wonder what he meant ? I couldn 't answer that . Then , what about the girl ? What do you think ? She said she was scared because I was groaning in my sleep . Hey , you know something ? I think we 're putting too much trust in Planet X. I think the people of earth have made a bad choice . Maybe they don 't have any water up there . Maybe they think that it 's time to move . Alright , let 's go check out that bungalow . Let 's see what we can find out . Okay , go . Halt ! We 're with the Space Authority . Commander ! I 'm Fuji from the Space Authority . - I 'm Glen . Could we go examine that bungalow ? You must be joking ! Look over there ! Godzilla ! Take positions . Take positions ! Move it ! A flying saucer ! Glen ... ! Yes , they were here already . Damn ! Commander , what should we do ? Should we fire ? Wait ! They 're not human ! It 's the X-people ! The X-people ! They 're coming this way ! - I can see that they are ! The middle one is the controller . This journey has brought the Earth and Planet X on a path that will lead toward galactic peace . I am pleased that we have embarked upon this friendship in the hope that we will benefit each other . This is a galactic peace . Controller speaks with a forked tongue , maybe ? We also want peace but we must be honest with each other . You secretly came to our planet and hid in the lake without permission . We did not mean to be indiscreet . I apologize . But , if we waited for permission Godzilla and Rodan may have had time to cause damage to your country . How do you plan on moving Godzilla and Rodan ? We will use a nuclear field unknown to the people of earth . Our technology allows us to transport items anywhere in space , regardless of its size . You do not believe me . The two flying saucers are the transports . The flying saucer is heading for Washikazawa . All units , follow the saucer and stay in touch . Move out ! Move out ! Move out ! Move out ! - Move out ! Move out ! Move out ! - Move out ! Move out ! The flying saucer ! Godzilla ! It 's Godzilla ! Glen ! Get a load of that ! Incredible ! Glen ... Let 's go . Right . It 's Rodan ! Rodan ! Brother , is it really alright ? It 's alright . They won 't notice the long trip they 'll be taking . Then , we 'll get the data for the cure for cancer . Is Glen going too ? Yes . Professor Sakurai , too . Brother , what do you think about Glen seeing Namikawa ? Is it alright ? Don 't ask me , Glen can answer that . Glen , don 't go . Stay here and marry me . Listen Namikawa , I 'll be back soon . Glen , you don 't understand what you 're saying ! You 're the one that doesn 't understand . What 's wrong with you ? Goodbye . I mean , so long ... I 'll marry you when I get back . Follow that car ! Well , we 're ready . Please come aboard . Sit down . May I ask you a favor ? Go ahead . Can we see the control room ? Here it is . This is it ? Decisions of navigation and operation are fed into these electronic components through my brainwaves . You mean you feed your will into the computer and let it control the ship the way you want ? That is correct . Can you do the same with animals and plants ? We can . You have a very inquisitive mind . I shall feed that into the memory banks of our computers . Are the computations calculated ? They are calculated . Everything is ready for you . How was that ? There is no shock compared to your space ships . But can you leave orbit carrying Godzilla and Rodan ? Do not worry . They will follow us obediently . 450,000,000 kilometers per hour as computed . 450,000,000 kilometers per hour ? Yes . It 's been only four hours , thirty minutes . That 's ... At the moment , we are restricted to one tenth the speed of light . The speed of light ? Our goal is to travel at the speed of light . What do you wish to see me about ? You have become too involved with the one called Glen . That 's not what I was doing . You are to follow orders , not emotions ! This is not an order from me ... It is from the controller ! I understand . The inventor Tetsuo is on the island . What ? ! Yet another project you 've handled poorly ! Well , we will be landing soon . Glen , take it easy . I 've got you , pal . Monster 01 and 02 are about to land . All work stations are to stand by . Standing by . - Roger . What 's with those pipes ? Suction , to retrieve hydrogen dioxide . Water is a precious commodity here . Work stations , hurry ! Monster Zero is approaching ! Professor Sakurai , look ... This time Monster Zero has finally met its match . This plan would not have been possible if it wasn 't for your planet 's cooperation . I am grateful . Look ! We have finally dealt a blow to protect ourselves from Monster Zero . What happened to Fuji and Glen ? ! They were here just a moment ago ! It 's no use . We can 't find anything . The most important thing is to find out what 's on the controller 's mind . I feel something fishy about him . If we don 't get back soon , he 'll become suspicious . Are you kidding ? He 's already suspicious . Come on ! It 's no good ! Notify the controller ! Switch ... Switch , where 's the switch ? I don 't see one . Alright , we 'll see where it stops . If it was air-conditioned , I 'd live in it ! Gold ! But to them , gold isn 't as precious as water . Yes , Planet X has run out of water . Someone 's coming ... Namikawa ! Glen ! Glen ! Namikawa , what are you doing here ? You haven 't forgotten , have you ? I 'm Glen , your Glen ! Don 't you remember ? Glen , let 's get going . You can put down your hands . You have caused us some concern . Why did you wander about without permission ? Well you must admit , our tour was somewhat limited . We got a little tired of sightseeing , and you might say we got a little nosy . Well then , what did you learn ? That water is more important to you than gold . But , we 're not short of it . It is easy to get . Oh , from where ? You will have to discover that yourself . One more thing ... Why do all the women here look alike ? Wouldn 't you agree that they are quite beautiful ? Yes , but beauty is more than skin deep . Beauty is what 's in the heart . Let 's not argue the matter . Seriously , the two of you have broken our laws . You are guests in our home this time so there will be no punishment . We apologize ... With that , we are keeping our promise to you . The data for the cure of cancer is on this tape . Take it ... Thank you . Now , your space ship is ready . The P-1 ! It is not the P-1 . When you were here on your last trip , we recorded all of its information to the last detail . This ship was created from that data . Godzilla ! Rodan is down there too . Professor , I wonder if we 're doing the right thing . Why do you ask ? Look at Godzilla and Rodan ... They seem to resent us leaving them behind . Hey , those two have caused us enough trouble already ! Don 't worry , they 'll find their own way ! Have you checked your equipment completely ? Okay ! We 're surprised at how well you 've built this replica . You will find out that this is no imitation of your previous ship . Well everyone , may you have a safe trip home . Oh , it was you who wanted me . Please , sit ... Do you know anything about Tetsuo ? Tetsuo ? Oh , he was the one bugging us about his invention . I haven 't seen him in a while . Really ? Yes , is anything wrong ? On the day my brother and Glen went to Planet X he said he would see me after finding you . Well ... Hey , how long do you plan on keeping me here ? You will not be released as of yet . You will understand soon . What will I understand ? ! We are going to change the earth 's history . Change history ? The controller wishes to speak with you . Right . Hey , wait ! Hey ! Hey ! Who is the controller ? This is earth control . This is the controller . What are your orders ? You are to begin plan two , item four , of schedule five . Plan two , item four , of schedule five . I understand . Good . I have the image on my screen . Good . Use the monitor . The gentlemen have arrived . Welcome home . Here it is . This tape contains the data of the cure for cancer . Is something wrong with the recorder ? I don 't think so . Is their system the same as ours ? Yes it is , according to them . I am the controller of Planet X. People of the earth , I demand that you obey these orders . Earth will be placed under our control and become a colony of Planet X. If these orders are not followed we will proceed to kill every citizen on the planet . Double-crossing fink ! Damn , we fell into his trap ! We expect you to follow our orders and obey them without delay . The startling announcement caused demonstrations around the world . Some wanted to accept the terms , wanting peace at any cost , while the majority vowed to fight . Violence erupted between the two factions . Glen ... That 's what I figured ... I am really from Planet X. When you went to my planet , you probably saw someone who looked like me . Tell me about it , Namikawa . Glen I am ordered electronically by our planet 's controller ! Did he ask you to marry me under his orders , too ? No , he didn 't . Glen , that was different ! I was ordered to spy on you but now you mean more to me than anything ! Look , you 've got to get out of this place and take off that outfit of yours ! No , you must become a citizen of Planet X , so we can be married ! That 's the only way I can save you ! Look Namikawa , we 're not robots . What kind of peace would it be if we 're controlled by machines ? In defense of earth , we 're going to fight to the last man . Now where 's your conscience , or have you turned that over to your computers too ? Listen to me Namikawa ! If there 's any chance of averting this war you better tell me about it now ! If we don 't find a solution soon , happiness in this world won 't be worth a hill of beans ! You hear ? ! Glen , I cannot become an earthling . It 's too late ! No it isn 't ! Glen ! It 's too late . I 've got big news for you , pal . As commander of this colony , I place you under arrest . Glen ... Glen ! You can 't do this ! They 'll destroy you ! Glen ... You rats ... You stinking rats ! What did you do to her ? ! Our actions are controlled by computers not by emotions ! When that is violated , the offender is destroyed . Fuji ! King Ghidorah is in America . What is this ? More bad news ... Will they use nuclear weapons ? They 're not sure yet . If they feel it will work against the enemy they won 't hesitate to use them . But won 't the radiation make life difficult for all of us ? It 's a tough choice between a tiger and a wolf . Brother ! Have you found Glen ? No , I 've looked all over for him ! Damn , where the hell has he gone to ? A flying saucer ! A saucer ! You have not complied with the orders of Planet X. We interpret this inaction as a negative reply . We are prepared to conquer the earth . We have stationed King Ghidorah in the Western Hemisphere . King Ghidorah was one of their weapons the whole time . King Ghidorah is under our control through magnetic waves . We also control Godzilla and Rodan . Damn ! These monsters can destroy mankind , and together they can conquer the earth . However , we shall delay our attack for twenty-four hours . This is your last chance ... They said they controlled Godzilla and Rodan by magnetic waves ... Yes , is that significant ? I think so ! Look at this ! A-cycle light ray projector ? Right ! Ah , it 's you ! You ? ! Well , this is a funny place to meet ! This place is nuts ! It 's no use . I 've looked over every inch of this cell . There 's no escape ... Why is this room soundproofed ? The walls have been soundproofed as well as the bars and the rest of the cell . The controller has issued new orders . We are to eliminate the entire population of the planet earth . No one is to survive our attack ! We will begin with the monsters in twenty hours . We have fifteen hours left . There is no other choice . We must use the earth 's entire nuclear arsenal . Perhaps it would be best if we all joined in prayer . I don 't see how prayers can help us . At least it would save our souls . Our only choices now are to surrender or attack ! It is up to the council . Just a moment . We still have a chance . I need several hours to work on it . What is it ? They are using magnetic waves to control Godzilla and Rodan . That 's where we may have our chance . If we can stop them from using the waves we can save the earth . Can you solve the problem ? You don 't have much time left ! The odds are against us but we 're running the final tests now . Alright , that 's good . There 's a problem in the A cycle . Please step this way . Fuji ... - Yes . How is it ? Yes . It 's generally going well . We don 't have much time left . Yes , yes . Well , how are you doing now ? At this time , this tape recorder is powered by magnetic waves from these two devices . Haro , please turn the switch . - Alright . Turn the switch on . - Yes . The problem is , we need to stop the waves from reaching here . As you can see , the waves are unaffected by this plate blocking the receptor . Therefore , we 've developed this A-cycle blocker which will transmit a signal that will cut off this wave . In order for you to see this work , I will make the wavelengths visible . You don 't think that this will work as it is ? Yes , but ... We 're not sure of the frequency that the saucers use to control Godzilla and Rodan . Alright , we 'll try this ... We 'll rig it to transmit on all twelve A-cycle frequencies at once . What if they operate on a frequency that goes beyond our range ? It will be up to god then . There 's nothing else we can do if this fails to work . Ten Hours to go . Good . All units on earth are ready to attack ! Good . Is everything computed ? Yes , everything is computed . It 's quiet ... Give up , we 'll never get out of here . No , we can 't ! Try to think about why this room is soundproofed ! Glen , this is ... Hey , this is the note from Namikawa . That sneaky witch ? ! Listen to this ! Glen , by the time you read this I shall have been eliminated for disobeying the directive of our computers . But I have no regrets . With you , I have found a love beyond all computations . You were right . Mankind cannot live as machines . We machines of Planet X can be destroyed , by a simple sound . Goodbye , Glen . I 've got it ! That 's why this room is soundproofed ! That 's it ! That 's why they bought my invention ! You mean this thing will make noise ? Yes , it will make you a nervous wreck ! Let me show you ... Stop it ! Stop it ! It works ! It works ! Hey , get the key from him ! Right ! Glen , this way ! Boss ! What 's wrong ? The prisoners have escaped ! What ? ! Controller ! Controller ! The prisoners have escaped ! Please assist us ! Good , they 're destroyed . Return to your posts ! This is a dangerous place ! Yes , wait until they find out it was their guards on the boat ! What do we do from here ? Well , we sure aren 't going to wait for the next ferry . Swim ! Five hours to go . Everything is going as computed . Good . Brother ! I 'm back ! Glen , where have you been ? Look at this . The A-cycle light ray can intercept their magnetic wave using a veil of metal particles ! You ... Why are you here ? He has the answer . She 's right ! Listen , Fuji , he 's got a great idea to knock off these guys ! What ? The miniature sound transmitter he devised causes great damage to their physical nature . Is this true ? We tried it and it worked . That 's why we 're here ! We have to put the sound of the transmitter onto radio waves amplify it , and then direct it toward the aliens ! I know it will work ! Good . Get started right away . We have three hours left ! Yes ! Okay ! Controller , the computer has found an error . What is it ... ? Computer team , what 's the emergency ? We are investigating ! Alright , we are left with no choice but to begin our attack now . Any changes ? The probabilities are decreasing gradually . Alright . Monster 01 and 02 , begin your attack ! Professor ! The aliens have begun their attack ! What ? Have they discovered us ? Well ... Go give Glen and Tetsuo a hand ! Yes , sir ! The computations are becoming clearer . Good . Continue the attack . We must press on . Fall back ! Fall back ! The computations say , success . Right . We must destroy all moving vehicles . Brother ! Hey , Glen how is it going ? ! Our trucks are taking severe damage ! It doesn 't look good ! We 'll be broadcasting in a few minutes . The mobile unit is getting ready , as well . Good , Keep it up . The world 's depending on us . Okay ! Let 's hurry ! - Okay ! Are there any mistakes ? There are no mistakes . Have Monster Zero begin its attack . This way ! This way ! Keep the second division in the tunnel until you receive the order . Second division , remain in the tunnel . Stay there until you are ordered . Roger ! Roger ! This way ... Use this machine here . - Thank you . Attention , everyone . This is an emergency broadcast . The sound you are about to hear is not a mistake . Please do not turn off your radio but please turn up the volume on the receiver as loud as it can go . Please make sure that the sound we broadcast is as loud as possible . Professor , they 've started broadcasting . Stand by to attack . Stand by ! - Yes , sir ! Stand by ! That does it . Now let 's go to Mikor Island . Okay . Attention please , the sound you hear is not a mistake . Do not switch off your radio , but turn it up as loud as you can . Please make sure that the sound we broadcast is as loud as possible . Controller ! What 's happening ? ! Move them out . - Yes , sir ! Move out ! Move out ! How do things look on the island ? I don 't understand . I don 't see anything . Look , it 's a flying saucer ! Okay , please begin transmitting . Right ! Begin transmission ! - Yes , sir ! Transmit ! What is wrong with our computers ? ! Respond , earth control ! Respond ! What is wrong with our computers ? ! Respond , earth control ! Respond ! It 's no good ! The noise ! The noise ! The noise ! The noise ! Please use the A-cycle light rays . Begin the attack . Heavy trucks , begin attack ! Professor , it worked ! Controller ! What 's wrong ? We 've lost all control over the monsters ! What ? ! What 's wrong with the calculations ? ! Earth base ! Earth base , respond ! We 've lost ! The earth plan is doomed ! Controller ! Controller ! Our computers can 't lose ! The earth plan can 't lose ! Retreat ! We must retreat ! No ! Give me calculations now ! Ah ! The saucer is on fire ! Yes ... Earth , we will escape ! We will escape to the future ! You haven 't seen the last of us ! We did it ! Yes ! Professor , we should retreat . Alright ! Fall back ! Hey ! What 's happening ? Look there ! Do you think Godzilla and Rodan are dead ? No , they 're not dead . What do you think , Fuji ? Well ... Now , if we could just have a vacation ... Not you , Glen ... You 're flying back to Planet X. What ? ! You are to be our first ambassador . Whatever 's fair , pal ! I 'd turn it down ... DVDRip by cjdijk .

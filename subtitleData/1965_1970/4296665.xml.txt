 Pretty sophisticated instruments . Yeah , they 're years in the future of our time . - [ Tony ] I wonder what they 're used for ? - I don 't know . But right now , I 'd settle for just knowing where we are . - He 's dead . - He can 't be . There 's no doubt about it . But that impact - It wasn 't hard enough to kill a man . Let 's see if we can find somebody . [ Machine Beeping ] - He isn 't as dead as you thought . - I tell you he was . Look at him . He 's a walking dead man . I don 't suppose you 'd care to explain what happened ? The only thing I 've got on my mind is just getting out of here . [ Door Slams ] Let 's see if we have any better luck with this one . How does a small-town hotel like this tie in with that scientific complex ? I don 't know . But we don 't need questions now . What we need is answers . First thing we have to do is find somebody . - Anybody . - Hello ? Hello , is anybody here ? - [ Bell Dinging ] - Hello ? You don 't have to raise the dead , young man . What can I do for you ? You want rooms ? Vittles ? Well , speak up , young men . Speak up . - Downstairs in the cellar , ma 'am - - Cellar ? - What cellar are you talking about ? - Right there . - The electronic equipment and the man . - Man . Cellar . [ Chuckles ] I wonder who dug it ... while I was out in the kitchen setting ' out the biscuit dough to raise . I don 't think anyone just dug it . You mean to tell me you don 't know - First things first , young man . Let 's start with this cellar business . Suppose you , uh , lead me to it . Well , we would , but the door 's locked . Oh , for pity 's sake . Ain 't been a lock on that door in 40 years . Now , come on . Come on . Haven 't got all day ... to worry about a cellar that ain 't there . You want to take a look , or don 't you ? You satisfied now ? [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . Hold it . - Hold it steady . - I can 't , General . It 's as though some force field was setting up interference . - We need more power . - Do you have a time fix ? - No . - You know where they are ? Somewhere along the North Atlantic Coast . Could we try a lateral space transfer ? - We 'll have to double the power output . - All right . Do it . [ Beeping ] - Report . - Our security has been penetrated . Two Earth people were found ... in the oxygen transfer control area here . I am already aware of that . These terrestrials - Who are they ? Information lacking . I am holding them helpless awaiting your orders . Within one hour ... we shall begin to remove all the oxygen in the air of their planet . They will die . How much time do we have to make the transfer ? Eight hours Earth time . It is your task to see that nothing interferes with our project . It shall be done . Ready to effect transfer . But with that interference , I 'm sure we can 't move them more than a few feet . That 's all we want.Just break them free of that force that 's holding them . We 'll try . - Are you ready ? - Ready . Transfer . But how could a laboratory suddenly turn into a preserve pantry - Hey , it is a lab . I don 't get it . What happened to the pantry and that old woman ? I don 't know . But someone or something is playing a weird joke on us . I just don 't understand why . Let 's try that cellar door again . An android . That could explain a lot of things . Yeah , or nothing unless we find a way out of here . [ Rattling Doorknob ] [ Rapid Beeping ] Andro 1 to Andro Leader . Ready to receive communication . Spaceship sensors indicate Earthlings have broken your control . Report . Request permission to eliminate terrestrials . Permission granted . Use oxygen removal test device ... as means to accomplish . Acknowledged . Let 's try the window . [ Chair Clattering ] - Now what ? - I don 't know . - [ Hissing ] - Listen . Sounds like gas . I don 't know about you , but I 'd rather take my chances with an android . It 's solid . This place is hermetically sealed . Let 's see if we can find an inlet . There 's got to be one here someplace . We 've got to find it . Tony , what 's standard atmospheric pressure at sea level ? 29.98 . Why ? It 's down four points . They 're not ... sending in gas . They 're taking out oxygen . Let 's take this bench . See if we can use it as a battering ram . Once more . [ Beeping ] All personnel . All personnel . Two Earth people have escaped from our control area . They are in the village . Find them . Kill them . Find them ! Kill them ! Looks like a New England town . The same vintage as the hotel lobby where we met that old lady . - There 's only one big difference . - What 's that ? There 's not a sign of life . - There 's got to be somebody . - [ Siren Wailing ] Come on . We 'd better find help before that android picks us up again . Pete , do you think they 're all right ? We can 't trust them . We never saw them before . Is everybody one of them ? I don 't think there 's anything left alive in this town except us . - We gotta find a way out of here . - We tried , didn 't we ? We 'll have to try some other way . Get down ! [ Siren Continues ] - Hey , they 're chasing the first two . - So ? Chasing them . Maybe the first two are like us , trying to hide . We 'd better follow ' em . Maybe we can help each other . - Hey , there 's our first break . Two live people . - Wait a minute . What 's the matter ? First , they were running . Now they 've stopped . - Why ? - I don 't know . [ Siren Continues ] How do you tell ' em from the townspeople ? - You don 't . That 's why we can 't take any chances . - [ Siren Stops ] That siren - It started just before the androids came after us . Why would it be stopping now ? I don 't know . But you can bet they haven 't given up . They must have something on their minds . That 's why we 've got to get out of town . They set up an electromagnetic force field . Probably have it around the whole town . There 's got to be some way to let the outside world know what 's going on here . - Telegraph . Radio . Something . - [ Siren Resumes ] We 're not gonna have much time . Let 's get into town , see if we can find a phone . They must be one of us . Maybe yes , maybe no . So let 's be careful . Andro Leader to Andro 1 . There must be no more mistakes . - I want them dead . - Acknowledged . They must be disposed of before we start our operations . It shall be done . When do we begin transfer of oxygen ? In 20 minutes Earth time . We must begin teleporting Earth 's oxygen ... to our own planet , or it will be too late . What is it ? What 's happened to them ? He 's like stone . It 's the woman from the hotel . They 're all frozen in some suspended form . Somehow , the androids must use their bodies to appear human when they want to . - Shh . - [ Door Closes ] It 's only a couple of kids . Are they ? General , we can 't lock our probe on them . It 's the force field around the town , General . Our normal power isn 't strong enough . Build it up . Use all the reserve if you have to . We 'll try . Feedback . We 've lost them ! That 's the honest truth . You two and Joan and me ... are the only real people in this town . All the rest are creatures . And these , uh , things - You say they 're gonna take all the Earth 's oxygen and remove it to their own planet ? That 's what we heard , mister . Some of them were talking about it down by the wharf . - We were heading out in Pete 's boat . - Look , you gotta believe us . The scientific setup in the hotel cellar - That must be their control system for the operation . Then we 've got to get to it and destroy it . Yeah , I know . But how ? Well , that all depends on what era we 're in , the weapons that are available . What year is this ? - You don 't know what year this is ? - Look . I know you won 't understand this ... but we come from another period of time . - Sure . I understand , mister . - No , you don 't . But that doesn 't matter now . You wanna save your lives , don 't you ? Yeah , sure . But we - There 's only one way to do it , and that 's stop those aliens . Now , we need your help . You don 't have any choice . He 's right , Pete . What difference does it make now ? It 's September 1 0 , 1 97 8 . 1 97 8 . That 's close enough to our own time that we should be able to handle the weapons . Do you have any guns ? Dynamite ? Things like that in town we can get to ? The general store . There should be some there . All right . Let 's get to it , fast . Is it like this all over town ? In every house and store we 've been in . - Where 's the dynamite ? - It 's over there . There 's more than enough to do the job . If we can get into that cellar complex . - [ Siren Wailing ] - Listen . - They 're after us ! - We 'll be ready . Everything here we need - tapes , fuses . All right , Ann . Power should be restored . - Let 's see if we can pick them up again . - Right . There . We have them again . We still haven 't fully penetrated their force field . [ Kirk ] Sharpen the focus , Ann . - [ Ann ] I 'm trying to . - [ Ray ] It 's not the probe . General , with a power surge from our reserve ... we might be able to penetrate their force field without the risk of a feedback . All right . Ann , call for the reserve . Yes , sir . Give me - Hello ? - [ Depressing Plunger ] - Hello ? The line 's dead . Hello ? This is General Kirk speaking . - Hello ? - [ Depressing Plunger ] This one 's out of commission too . Ray , use the corridor phone . Contact Communications Repair . [ Gasping ] What 's the matter , Ann ? I - Nothing . For a moment , I , uh - - No , I 'm all - all right now . - General . - What is it ? - All communications going out of the area are dead . All the doors and exits are jammed shut tight . They can 't be opened . I wish we had some help against those aliens . The townspeople aren 't gonna be any help . - [ Snaps Fingers ] - Unless ... the Time Tunnel can bring them back to life . Yeah . General ? General Kirk , can you hear me ? Ann ? Swain ? This is September 1 0 , 1 97 8 . Can you see us ? Our location is Cliffport , Maine . I feel light-headed . It 's a heaviness in the chest , General . Did you find out anything ? How about the door ? [ Out Of Breath ] Sealed tight . There 's something wrong with the air support system . I don 't understand . Barometer indicates atmospheric pressure ... down a couple of points . All the air compressors are working . I just checked the inlets myself . It 's - It 's as though something is ... removing the oxygen from the - Losing - Losing oxygen . - We 're losing oxygen through the Tunnel . - Then - Then let 's shut down . - We 'll shut off power . - No . We 'll lose our contact with Doug and Tony . Only temporarily . Only temporarily . Go ahead , Ray . Hit the switch . No response . It won 't shut down . The master switch . General , can you hear us ? It 's no use . We 'll just have to do it ourselves . - Hey . Hey ! - What 's the matter with you ? You . You 're one of them . - No , we 're not . - We heard you . We saw you . Talkin ' to something , somebody up there - one of them . - We weren 't talking to one of them . - You were ! We heard you ! We were talking to somebody who might be able to help us , Pete . Sure , we know . Help you kill us . No , we were talking to friends . The Time Tunnel . Now , what 's that supposed to mean ? What kind of a tunnel is that ? Look , we don 't expect you to understand ... but they might be able to help us against those creatures . Pete , don 't listen to ' em ! They 'll make us into statues too ! Pete , listen to me . If you go out there , you 'll run right into them . Now stay with us . We 'll help you . Believe me . - No ! - Pete ! Let ' em go , Tony . Well , it wouldn 't have done any good to explain it to them anyway . - Should we try to find Joan and Pete ? - Let 's get that cellar first . [ Screams ] Andro 1 to Andro Leader . Andro 1 , report . Preparations for ionization of atmospheric oxygen completed . Ready to teleport Earth 's free oxygen to Andros . Begin . Teleporting of Earth 's free oxygen begun . Oxygen is heavy . It sinks to the floor . Get down . Get down . Stay there . Come on . Get down . Breathe down there . Come on . Hurry up . Down on the floor . You 'll breathe better . - Ann . Ann . - What ? Get down on the floor . [ Gasping ] Yes . Ray . Ray , get down - down on the floor . [ Coughing ] Tony ? Doug ? Tony , can you hear me ? This is Time Tunnel calling you . Reply . - Tony ? - What ? - I didn 't say anything . - I thought I heard something . Can you hear me , Doug ? - Can you hear me ? - We hear you , General . Do you have a fix on us ? Yes . Yes , but we 're not able to - General , we 're in trouble . We need help . Can you track us ? Doug , now listen to me . We 're not able - Ann and Ray are - - Some power has got a hold of the complex . - Go ahead . What 's wrong ? Well , I think - Well , we think ... because we 're locked into you ... our oxygen is being drained out of the complex . We 're suffocating . They must be hooked into the same thing that 's going on here . General . 1 97 8 . September 1 0 . Cliffport , Maine . Invasion from another world . They 're taking all the Earth 's free oxygen . General , turn us loose . Disconnect us . It 's the only chance you have of saving yourself . If anything happens to you , we don 't have a chance at all . Doug , we can 't do it . They 've locked us into 1 97 8 too . It 's up to you to cut the connection on your end . You 've got to do it . It 's the only way . There 's enough time . Fifteen minutes maybe . Maybe even more . Maybe - Maybe - Maybe 20 minutes . Doug - - We 've gotta get to that cellar . - [ Joan Screams ] [ Screaming ] Andro Leader to Andro 1 . Attention . I hear you , Andro Leader . Multiply Andro 2 . Andro 2 multiplied . - What are we gonna do ? I - - Now , you stay with us . [ Thunder Rumbling ] What 's happening ? They must 've started draining oxygen from the atmosphere . A low pressure area here will cause a storm center . General , how - How long can we hold out ? We 'll hold out . We 'll hold out . Tony and Doug are gonna try to cut themselves loose from the Tunnel ... from their end . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Tony ? Doug ? [ Groans ] Hurry . Hurry . [ Gasps ] We can 't take her in the hotel . Now listen . You stay right here . - No ! I 'm afraid . Take me with you . - You 'll be safer here . - What if one of them comes ? - You don 't have to worry about that . They won 't be out in this gale . They 're not built to take this kind of punishment . - That 's true . - You just stay right here . Do as I say . We 'll be back for you . [ Ticking ] Joanie , where are you ? Joan ! Joanie , where are you ? Joan , where are you ? Pete , where are you ? Joanie ! Where are you ? Pete . ! I 'm in here , Pete . ! Stay there ! I 'm coming ! [ Exhales ] Hi . Are you all right ? Pete ? What 's the matter ? - Hey , what 's the matter ? - Stay away from me . What 's got into you ? Oh , you-You think I 'm one of them ? But I saw from around the corner - It never touched me . I just stood stock-still . You screamed and ran , and I 've been looking for you ever since all over town . What 's the matter , honey ? Don 't you believe me ? I don 't know . Well , here . Pinch me . It 's real . Joanie , it 's me , honest . Oh . Oh , Pete . Now , am I real , or ain 't I ? Oh , I feel so scared . I don 't blame you , honey . What happened to Tony and Doug ? They must be in the hotel by now . They 're gonna blow it up . [ Screams ] Young man , don 't you - [ Ticking ] [ Pete ] Tony ? Doug ? Where are you ? [ Imitating Tony 's Voice ] Doug ? Doug , over here . Help me , Doug . Help , Doug . ! Help . ! Doug , don 't listen to it ! It 's not me ! Stay where you are ! [ Pete ] Doug ? Mr. Phillips , it 's me , Pete . I 'm over here , Doug . Over here . Help me . I 'm coming , Pete . [ Tony ] Doug . ! Doug , where are you ? I 'm over here . - What 's that all about ? - I had to be sure . Come on . We 've only got a few seconds . It 's all over . You 'll be safe now . We 've succeeded in blowing up their complex . Now , that should release everyone that they 've touched . Well , I guess Tony and Doug broke the connection . Connection ? What connection ? I 'll tell you about it . Well , the sky 's still there . [ Pete ] Joanie . ! Joanie ! It 's Pete . [ Siren Wailing ] Land 's sakes ! I 'm on fire ! [ Horn Blaring ] Titanic . Captain . - Good afternoon . - Captain , I must speak to you . It 's very important . Yes , of course . You 're , um-You 're Mr. - My name is Newman , sir , but that doesn 't matter . I must tell you something . Yes , of course , Mr. Newman . What did you want to say ? This ship is the Titanic . Is that what you had to tell me ? What I mean , sir , is the Titanic sank . It struck an iceberg and was lost . Captain , I know you didn 't believe my friend here , and you won 't believe me . But you can believe your own eyes . This ship will strike an iceberg at 1 1 : 40 tonight and go down . - The story 's all here in tomorrow 's paper . - Take them below . And this time , see that they stay there . [ Ship 's Horn Blowing ] Captain , do you think maybe we could all be of more help on the decks ? Yes , yes , of course . It occurs to me now you may even know whether I will die tonight . Yes , sir , I 'm afraid you will . [ Shouting ] - Mr. Thomas . - Sir . Only women and children are to be allowed in the lifeboats . - That order is not to be violated . - Aye , aye , sir . - Mr. Martin . - Sir ! Advise the boiler room to evacuate all stations immediately . Aye , aye , sir . Tony , there 's trouble on " " A " Deck . Follow me . Doug ! Tony ! Freeze them !

 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - The Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . - [ Explosion ] - Tony ! [ Explosion ] [ Explosion ] - [ Whistling ] - [ Explosions Continue ] [ Men Shouting ] [ Shouting , Indistinct ] [ Explosion ] - Where 's the rest of the crew ? - Trapped . Trapped . Over 200 of 'em . All trapped . [ Explosion ] This way ! It 's blocked off here . Go the other way . Hey , you ! Get out of here ! - [ Explosion ] - Hold on ! - What 's happened ? - Some men trapped back there . - How many ? - Must be 200 . You better get out of here . There 'll be more explosions . - We 've got to get them out ! - No ! That 's my job ! Now you get out of here ! Tony ! Tony ! Doug ! Doug , I 'm here ! - Are you all right ? - Yes ! Listen , I can get to the surface ! I 'll bring help ! - We 'll get you out . ! - Okay ! I 'll be right back ! - Where 's the rescue crew ? - There isn 't any . What ? All those men down there , they 'll die . What 's the difference ? They 're no better than the rest of us . Now you pick up that phone and you get some men together . - Who 'd come now ? - What are you talking about ? What else is there to talk about , mister ? That-That thing out there . [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . [ Oscillating ] Dr. Swain . Rome ! That 's St. Peter 's Square . [ Ray ] And not too far back . No earlier than the turn of the century . What are they looking at ? Ann , can you change your viewing angle ? I 'm trying . Ah . You 've lost contact . No , wait . I 'm getting a response again . No , wait a minute . That 's not St. Peter 's . Anybody recognize it ? It looks semitropical . Ann ? Could be South America . Buenos Aires , perhaps . Oh , it 's fading again . [ All Shouting , Indistinct ] That could be England . Or is it Wales ? You 're right about the period , Ray . Look at those clothes . [ Chattering ] Ann , you 're losing picture again . Can 't you hold it in one place ? No . We have a time fix , but we just haven 't located them in space . That 's why it keeps shifting . A comet , early 20th century . Of course ! Halley 's Comet . Jerry ! Jerry , get Research to give us everything they 've got on Halley 's Comet . Right away , General . Its last approach was , let 's see - 1 91 0 , late spring . Yes . That checks with my readings here . Try the spatial control now . - [ Flipping Switches ] - Contact ! - It 's Doug . - You got the fix , Ann . Now clarify the image . Somebody 's got to help those men or they 'll all die . Nobody can save ' em . We can 't save ourselves . Then I 'll do it alone . [ Pick Clanking ] - Doug ! - [ Clanking ] Doug , is that you ? Hang on ! I 'll get you out ! - Are you all right ? - [ Grunts ] - Where are the miners ? - Trapped in the next shaft . Can we dig them out ? I don 't know . The main cave-in happened at the far end . - [ Rumbling ] - We 'd better get out of here . - This one 's about to go too . - What about those men ? We can 't just leave ' em here to die . We need help . All the men we can get . - Well , where are they ? Why aren 't they here ? - [ Rumbling ] Come on ! He tells me there are 200 men trapped in that bottom shaft . So now there are two of you . I don 't recall seeing ' either one of you around here before tonight . - Who are you anyway ? - What difference does it make ? There 's a whole shift trapped down there , and no one 's lifting a finger to help them . - No help for ' em now . No help for anybody . - What are you talking about ? Haven 't you heard ? The world 's coming to an end . Take a look out there , Tony . - May 1 91 0 . That 's Halley 's Comet . - That 's right . Is that what you mean by the end of the world ? Well , you 're wrong . That comet 's not gonna hit us . It 's gonna pass by . Oh , you know more than the experts , huh ? - As a matter of fact , I do . - That 's right , Henderson . That comet won 't do any damage . - By this time tomorrow , it 'll be gone . - It 'll be gone . So will we . Mister , you 're gonna let 200 men die because of a mistake . Nothing I can do about that . As far as those men down in the hole go ... - I expect they 're already dead . - Well , maybe not . They might be dead at that , Tony . That last cave-in was a big one . Doug , we can 't assume anything until we know for sure . - Who was in charge down there ? - Blaine . Best young gang boss on the payroll . - Yeah , well , he saved my life . - I feel real sorry for him . But there 's no helping a dead man . [ Ringing ] - That 's a direct line to the shaft . - Yeah ? This is Blaine . We 're trapped in the third level . We can 't get through . - How long can you hold out ? - I don 't know . The situation 's pretty bad . How soon before a rescue crew can get here ? They want to know when the rescue crew will get to them . How do I tell them there isn 't one ? They 'll be better off where they are . If they got out , they 'd - they 'd have to face that . - Do they know about the comet ? - No . When the word came , they 'd already gone down below . If you didn 't intend to help those men , why did you bother to hang around here ? Didn 't appear to be any purpose in goin ' anywhere . The way I look at it , you 're as bad off one place as another . What 's happening ? I can 't hear anything . Blaine . The rescue crew 's getting organized . Just hold out . You hear that , men ? Help 's comin ' . [ Explosion ] Tell ' em to hurry ! Tell ' em - - Hello ? Hello ? - [ Coughing ] Hello ? - Here 's the research you asked for on the comet , General . - Right . Thank you . Well , it 's getting closer to Earth every minute . No wonder the people back there were scared . According to this , it came even closer before it veered off . Is there any way it could affect this complex ? What you 're seeing , General , happened nearly 60 years ago . Well , that comet 's somewhere in our solar system right now . That 's right . It first appeared in 1 531 ... again in 1 607 ... then it came back in 1 682 , 1 759 , 1 835 . And then in 1 91 0 . But no danger to us today in 1 968 . Is there ? Well , as I said before , General , what you 're seeing happened nearly 60 years ago . That 's not what I asked , Ray . I 'd like a direct answer . Is there any way it can affect this complex ? General , we all know that the Time Tunnel is not perfected . For example , it has only marginal control over Doug and Tony . We 've hardly reached a point where its operation is even 50 % predictable . You 're both still beating about the bush . I want to know . Can that comet affect our complex ? Affirmative or negative ? - Unknown . - Unknown . - You see , General , you don 't understand - - Duty here is voluntary . - Would you like to be relieved ? - No , sir . Is there any way we can get a better fix on 1 91 0 ? Well , we can try , General . - Ann , refine polarization , give us a quick scan . - Right . I don 't care what you 've been told . The world is not coming to an end . You just gonna sit there and let those men die for nothing ? - Who 's Ainsley ? - He 's a professor up at the observatory . A brilliant man . Everybody respects him . Yeah , well , he 's dead wrong ! Look , Henderson , we 're never gonna get a rescue party ... unless we can convince enough men that the world isn 't going to end . Yeah . That 's for sure and certain . Suppose I got this Ainsley to retract his statement , to admit that he was mistaken . Would that have any effect on the people around here ? Yes . I - I expect it would , and , well , I 'll tell you why . Because a herd of wild horses couldn 't make that man say something he didn 't believe . Well , I don 't think you could , either . That 's all I need to know , because he is wrong . Tony , I 'm going to get Ainsley to retract his position . How ? - Tell him where we come from ? - No . The last thing in the world is we want these people to think we 're out of our minds . If only we could get Ray or somebody back at that complex to send us some modern instruments . - We don 't even know if they can still read us . - Yeah , I know . I 'm just gonna have to demonstrate the facts the best I can . That 'll take too long . Those men need help right now . Tony , I know what I 'm doing . You 've got to believe me . Okay . Try it . But I 'll do it my way . - After you 've seen Ainsley , meet me back here . - Hey , where are you going ? Into town . We need men to help . Hang it all , Tom , I haven 't got a deputy to send . I don 't care what 's happening over there . I haven 't got nobody . Nobody at all . Tell you what , try Philipsburg . Could be they 're in better shape than we are . All right , Tom , all right . Just keep your shirt on . That 's a good one . Me send deputies . There 's been a bad cave-in down at the mine . I need men , lots of them . Oh , you do ? Where do you figure on gettin ' ' em ? Aren 't there any men around here at all ? Son , I know there 's trouble at the mine . I heard the disaster whistle , but I didn 't pay it much mind ... not with the whole town runnin ' off like a bunch of scared horses . There are 200 men down there . If we don 't dig them out soon , they 'll all die ! - Yeah , I expect they will . - Well , aren 't you gonna do anything about it ? - There 's just so much one man can do . - [ Rings ] Sheriff s office . Oh , hello , Owen . What ? Oh , that 's a real shame . No . No , there 's nothing here at all . I 'm sorry , boy , but I can 't help you . No . No , it won 't do no good tryin 'Carver . They 're up to their necks in trouble over there . No . No , not a chance . I 'm real sorry . Look , a handful of men . That 's all I need.Just a handful ! That was the county seat on the line just then . Their whole town 's on fire . The whole town . And all I could tell ' em was let it burn . Where can I find somebody ? Anybody at all that might help ? Son , have you got any notion what a big thing this is ? That 's from the governor . Riot in the state capitol . National Guard mobilized . And he wants me to send men . Me , with nobody left here at all . What about the townspeople ? They haven 't just vanished off the face of the Earth . Try Pilgrimage Hill at the south end of town . That 's where they all run off to . - Took off ? Why ? - Seems like they all took up with religion all of a sudden . They 're prayin ' and waitin ' , and that 's about all a man can do right now . No much time for that either . I 'm sorry , son . I wish I could help you , I really do , but my job is right here . No matter what anybody else does , I 'm sticking by this post now . - Good luck to you . - [ Rings ] - Sheriff s office . Oh , hello , Johnny . - [ Door Opens , Closes ] No . Twenty men ? No , impossible . I haven 't got a man to spare . Not a single man . For your information ... every major observatory we could reach has confirmed my calculations . I can 't help that , Professor Ainsley . That comet will not collide with the Earth . It won 't even pass close enough to have measurable effect on it . My dear sir , I wish I could believe you . You can . There isn 't a doubt in the world . Well , in that case , I 'd be delighted to go over the calculations ... - that have led you this happy conclusion . - I 've made none . I see . Well , then there 's simply no point to further discussion . There 's every point ! All those miners will die unless you publicly admit your error . You may have made no calculations , but I have . Checked and rechecked 50 times by the finest minds in the university . The very finest . Who are you to challenge all this ? Professor , if I were to tell you about myself , you wouldn 't begin to believe me . But if I know anything in this world , I know that that comet will not hit . My dear sir , we 're all in the same boat . My staff has deserted me . But I intend to stay here and take observations until - Well , as long as I can . Will you permit me to prove my point ? - How ? Don 't tell me you 're a scientist . - I am . - Then I 'd be interested in seeing your proof . - Thank you . I can supply you with any data you may require . [ Tony ] Round up some men . As many as you can get . There 's been a cave-in at the mine . Need help at the mine . There 's been a cave-in . The men are trapped . There 's been a cave-in at the mine . We need volunteers . Round up some men , as many as you can get . What 's the matter with you people ? Listen to me ! You listen to me ! I need volunteers ! That 's not gonna hit ! Do you hear me ? It 's not the end of the world ! What 's the matter with you people ? Listen to me ! You listen to me . ! I need volunteers . ! Doug can 't hope to prove much with the instruments of the period of 1 91 0 . If he only had a radarscope to work with . - We have one . - No , Ann , I don 't want to risk sending anything back . Not until we get a more stable fix on them . It seems to me it 's worth the risk , right ? With a radarscope , he could prove his point in short order . Oh , I don 't know , General . - Oh , I agree with the general . I think we should gamble on it . - All right , let 's do it . Come on , Jerry , take over the controls . I 'll make the arrangements . Now give us a fix on the comet , Jerry . I want to get more readings . Dr. Swain , what if I switch to the mine shaft ? - Maybe we could move those poor guys down there . - Not a chance , Jerry . - I don 't think we should focus too long on this comet . - Why ? Well , I was just thinking . If our focus puts us within its magnetic field - What possible effect could that have on - Masses of opposite polarity attract each other , sir . The magnetic forces would blow out every power unit in this complex . Aside from the fact we 'd have a big repair bill on our hands ... would we learn anything if that should happen ? Yes , sir . So far , we 've learned more from failure than success . Hold the focus . And sharpen it . Henderson ? Oh , I just came over to see what I could do to help . How 'd you make out on the hill ? - There 's nobody with me . - I 'm not surprised . - Where 's Henderson ? - Nobody here when I came . - Reckon he took off for the hills . - Yeah , I guess so . Well , let 's not just stand here . Let 's go dig these fellas out . - [ Clanking ] - Henderson ! Well , you know-you know , young fella , you got me to thinkin ' . Evenin ' , Sheriff . A man has no call to sit around and wait for the end . When it comes , he ought to be doin 'somethin ; So , here I am . Sheriff , get that pick working ' . - Get to work . Do you good . - Now wait a minute . Three of us can 't do anything until we bring some timbers down and shore up these walls . What 's the difference ? What 's another cave-in among friends ? - Hey , cut that out . Hey , cut it out ! - Get back ! Get back ! It 's the same everywhere - looting , burning , pillaging . No wonder they thought it was the end of the world . The radarscope is ready to send back . - Good . Get it in the tunnel . - Right . - Jerry , get a fix on Dr. Phillips . - Yes , sir . [ Sighs ] Here 's the speed per second . Does that check with your charted orbit ? - Check . - Angle of perihelion and - Yes ? - Impact . - Of course . You 've done it beautifully . And you 've confirmed my findings . - Interrupt the reception . - [ Flips Switch ] Stand by for switching . [ Beeping ] Now . [ Oscillating ] - What went wrong ? - Imperfect fix , obviously . Jerry , zero in on the comet again . - We 'll get our time coordinates from there . - Yes , sir . It checks . Every observation , every figure ... - checks . - Naturally . I told you that in beginning . And yet I know that that comet will not hit . You keep saying that . You 're an exceptionally intelligent man . You 've given me ample proof of that . And yet you say this with a conviction that 's very nearly mystical . I 'd appreciate an explanation . I wish I could give you one . - Maybe if I could contact Tony . - Tony ? - This line is dead . - I 'm not surprised . The operator , like everybody else , has given up . After all , we only have ... two hours and 25 minutes until the end of everything . [ Grunting ] - Are you all right ? - Guess so . Maybe I ain 't so easy to kill . [ Coughing ] Hold it . Hold it . Hold it . You 'll start another slide . - Go on , get out . - Uh-uh . I ain 't leaving you here like this . Poor Henderson . He wasn 't so lucky . - Better get to the surface while you still can . - What about you ? - Try to get some help . It 's the only way . - There ain 't nobody up there . I 'll get you out . [ Grunting ] - [ Coughing ] - What 's the matter ? Huh ? [ Coughing ] What ? Everybody giving up ? Uh , right now there 's probably a hundred men - 200 - digging a passage to us . - [ Coughing ] - They 're doing everything they can . We 're gonna be free . - [ Coughing ] - You hear me ? Huh ? We 're gonna be free . [ Screaming , Shouting ] Poor devils . They really are convinced it 's the end of the world . It will be for some . - Doctor , there 's something odd going on . - How do you mean ? - Remember what you said about the magnetic attraction of masses ? - Yes . What about it ? Wouldn 't the comet and Earth assert attractive forces on each other ? Of course , Jerry . But , practically speaking ... Halley 's Comet today is several billion miles away from - - Jerry , you 're not keeping a constant fix on the comet . - That 's what I mean . I can 't . There 's something weird about this thing , about the way it affects the controls . Come on . Let me take over . The time is very nearly upon us . Ainsley , every piece of information we have tells us that comet is going to hit . - Exactly . - Suppose it doesn 't.Just suppose . An hypothesis . What could interfere with it at the last moment ? Only one thing , obviously . Some mass great enough to divert it from its trajectory . That 's it . A mass in the heavens . No , no . That 's impossible . There isn 't one ... - or we would have observed it . - A dark mass that reflects no light . - Now your instruments couldn 't pick that up , could they ? - Well , no . Well , it 's there . I know it 's there . If we only had a radarscope . - I beg your pardon ? - Uh , never mind . What else could we use ? Let 's see , 1 91 0 . 1 91 0 . Is it too early for the radiometer ? The Nichols Radiometer . There aren 't a half dozen of them in existence . - Do you have one ? - As a matter of fact , we do . - A gift to the university . But I still don 't see - - Get it for me , please . - I 'll prove my thesis to you . Hurry ! - Very well . No ! No , you 'll bury the both of us ! That 's a chance we both have to take . All those people and not one willing to help . Standing there in that field holding those stupid torches ... looking up at the sky like they could hardly wait to die . I guess it 's hard to tell how a person will react if they believe they 're gonna die . For me , I 'd rather face it like old Henderson there ... or those poor devils in the lower shaft . - A crude device , but it just may work . - Crude ? This is the most advanced instrument of its kind in existence . Of course . Let 's get it hooked up to the telescope , shall we ? - Make a focus . I 'll monitor the dial . - Right . Start your scanning . - Are you getting anything yet ? - Nothing . Take another segment . Wait ! Go back about one degree . There ! Freeze ! - What are you getting ? - Intense radiant energy . - What do you see ? - Nothing ! Not a darn thing ! Then it 's - it 's true . Look here . I told you . There 's an object up there . A nonreflecting mass of something . You can 't pick it up visually ... - but it 's there . - I can 't argue about that . Is the mass big enough to affect the trajectory of the comet ? More than enough . Observe . It 'll start exerting its pull at this point . The tail will appear to vanish as it starts to veer off . You 're right . It 's going to miss the Earth . - We 've got to get this news out . - Well , you won 't do it that way . You 've got to go up to the hills and tell the people . I 'll explain on the way . Come on ! [ Crowd Chattering ] [ Doug ] You people , you don 't know me . But you know this man - Professor Ainsley of the observatory . He 's the man who told you when this comet was going to hit . You believed him then . Listen to him now . I was wrong . Do you understand ? Wrong . The world will not end . The comet will not destroy us . The sun 's going to rise as it always has . Nothing will be changed . The comet will go out into space where it cannot harm us . What 's the matter with you people ? He 's telling you the truth ! Wait . I 'll prove it . Look at the comet . See the tail ? The tail is a cloud offlaming gas . It 's going to vanish . Professor , tell them exactly when that tail will vanish . In exactly ... 1 5 seconds from now . Ten seconds . Five seconds . - You better be right . - I am . - Two , one - - Look ! [ Chattering ] Professor , bring these people down . I 'm gonna get back to the mine . Doctor , there 's a bit of smudge on your cheek . There . You 've got the fix . Now hold it . Yes , but I 'm getting a strange reaction on the dials . You see that ? They 've gone completely wild . - That is strange . - What 's the problem ? Some external force we can 't identify . It 's exerting some kind of magnetic pull . It 's the comet . We 're locked in on it . It 's coming right in on us ! Jerry , get ahold of yourself . That 's an image . It can 't possibly affect us . Get back to your post . You said that opposites masses attract . Jerry , that 's 1 91 0 . But the tunnel connects us with 1 91 0 in time ... now ! [ Whirring ] All right , Ann , I 'll take over . We learn from failure , you said . But we can 't afford a failure that would destroy the tunnel . Is it possible that something that happened in 1 91 0 could touch us physically ? Jerry 's right . The Time Tunnel does connect us with the comet . We 're in the same time segment . Don 't you see ? The quotient of the value of time - Segment . Quotient . You can prove anything with words , equations . - I 'm talking about a commonsense definition of time . - Commonsense definition ? To my knowledge , no one has ever succeeded in defining time . - [ Electrical Explosions ] - Jerry , cut the power ! - Cut it off ! . - Power off ! . All systems ! - Jerry , cut the power ! I said cut it ! - I have cut it off ! . - What 's wrong ? - The power 's jumping the circuit breakers ! - But that 's not possible ! - I know , but it 's happening . Clear the Tunnel Complex ! All personnel , out ! Clear the complex ! - [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Explosion ] [ Blaring Continues ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Ann , Indistinct ] The power 's off ! . I don 't understand it ! It should stop ! [ Wind Howling ] [ Kirk ] Look out . ! Look out . ! Hold on . ! Help ! Help me ! Jerry ! Ahh ! Jerry ! Help me ! - [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Wind Howling ] - Hold on ! - Cut the power grid ! Shut that down ! - Help ! - [ Thunderclap ] - [ Siren Stops ] - Jerry . You all right ? Here . Come on . Come on , here . Over here . [ Sobbing ] - What 's the matter ? - He stopped breathing . - His heart has stopped . - It 's a massive electrical shock . Get the emergency resuscitator ! On the double ! - Hurry ! - Quick ! Get his breathing started . - He 's not responding . - Here . Pressure on the breastbone . - Start his heart . - Where are those men with the resuscitator ? Here . Put it on him . Help me put this around the back . Right under his heart . Good . All right , now get away from him . [ Ray ] All right ! That 's enough . Come on , Jerry . That 's all right . We won 't need it now . - You 're all right , Jerry boy . - Some of you men give him a hand . You 'll be all right now . [ Kirk ] What the devil happened ? We almost brought the comet itself back . I 'd say that it 's time to reexamine the whole project . - Now just what is that supposed to mean ? - Just this . We 're dealing with forces of cosmic proportions about which we know little or nothing . The dangers , you mean . Ray , all experimentation has a certain amount of danger . A certain amount , Ann ? Bringing the force of Halley 's Comet across a few billion miles ... and right into the Tunnel - a certain amount ? The H-bomb is nothing but a toy balloon compared to the forces we 're loosening here . Ray , aren 't you forgetting something ? Doug and Tony ? No , Ann . I 'm only trying to measure their lives against others we 're endangering . - Our own ? - Oh , that isn 't fair . Now , Ray has risked his life as often or more often than any of us on this project . - I know . I 'm sorry . - The thing to do is not to scrap the project ... but to try and build more safeguards around it . General , don 't we say that a couple of times a year ? Then we come right back here the next morning ... and start playing with forces beyond imagination . Ray , how long would it take you to repair all this ? [ Sighs ] I don 't know . A few hours , a few days . Well , we 'll have to look it over . If we 're out of touch with Doug and Tony for too long , we may lose them forever . I know , Ann , I know . We 'll get the repair crews on it right away . [ Panting ] - What 's the time ? - What 's the difference ? A couple minutes one way or the other won 't matter now . If those men are dead , it was all for nothing . That 's exactly how I feel . All for nothing . [ Phone Ringing ] - Blaine ! - For the love of heaven , help us . - How many are left ? - All of us ... so far . But hurry . We can 't hold out . Hold on . Hold on . We 'll be there . Don 't lie to them , give those men false hope . How long ... before you reach us ? I guess you 're right . - [ People Shouting ] - We did it ! They 're coming down from the hills . A whole mob of them , enough to dig out those tunnels in no time flat . - Blaine . - What 's-What 's happening ? What 's that shouting ? We 're on our way . We 're on our way ! They 're coming . [ Crowd Shouting ] Come on , you men ! Hurry up ! They 've been separated in time . Doug ? Doug . ! Doug . ! See who that is . Hold it right there , mister . I 'm one of the men in charge of this station . [ Panting ] You must be new here . I 'm Dr. Newman . I 'm back . I 've been here 1 4 months , mister . I never heard of any Dr. Newman . Fourteen months ? But I 've been here every day for the past seven years . What 's the problem , soldier ? Jiggs ? [ Panting ] It is you , isn 't it ? I didn 't recognize you without the mustache . Jiggs , it 's me , Dr. Newman . Newman ? I never heard of any Newman around here . And , mister , I never had a mustache . What are you talking about ? You know me . Tony Newman . Mister , I 've never seen you before in my life . They brought me back in the wrong time . - He looks younger . - And look at the license plate on that truck . Magnification ! We brought him back 1 0 years ago . We didn 't . It just happened . A fluke . But if he 's this close ... Ray , we 've got to close a 1 0-year gap before we lose him . - Why not just go out there ? - You 'd see nothing . You 're in the present . That 's taking place 1 0 years ago . What 's the trouble here , Sergeant ? Doug ! Doug , they got you back too . You better get going , Doc . We got a weird one here . - It 's Phillips . - Yeah , 1 0 years ago . Newman was still in school . He and Phillips hadn 't even met . Good Lord . ! Can you imagine the nightmare Tony must be living through now ? - Ray , can 't you do anything ? - Intensify the probe . Well , you better see that he gets a ride back into town , Jiggs . After what he 's seen , he 'll have to answer a few questions for our security officer . Doug . Doug , wait . Tell them who I am ! Doug , tell them who I am ! Doug , tell them who I am ! Doug ! Doug ! Doug , wait ! Wait ! Doug ! On the double ! If he doesn 't stop , shoot him ! Tony 's broken away . He 's half out of his mind . We need more time to try a return transfer . He doesn 't have time . ! He 'll resist and those men may kill him . - Superimpose his signal with Doug 's . - We 'll lose him . At least the two of them will be together when we try a location probe . Doug ! Doug ! - [ Gunshot ] - Doug ! Doug ! Everything must be destroyed . Everything . We must leave nothing for tomorrow morning . I will see to it , Professor . - Everything in every office . - Hai . How did you get in ? We , uh - We sort of came in by mistake . What are you doing here ? Who are you ? We 're tourists . Uh , just sightseeing . Nobody sightsees inside thejapanese Consulate . I assure you we-we didn 't know this was thejapanese Consulate . Everybody in Honolulu knows that . The day before the attack on Pearl Harbor . In thejapanese Consulate . Leave the consulate at once . - Please . - Try for a time lock , quick , before we lose them . Power ! All units ! We 're sorry to have intruded . They are spies . Why let them escape ? Because their superiors would trace them to us ... and it would be dangerous to create an incident today . Follow them . If they make one suspicious move , kill them . Hai . !

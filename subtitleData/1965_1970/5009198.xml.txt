 All the characters in this movie are fictional . Any similarities to real events or persons are coincidental . Has the entire charge exploded ? - Yes , there 's no risk . He 's approaching the crater . My God , what 's he doing ? Jansen ! HIBERNATUS Careful . - Ok . Monday , February 2 The French-Danish expedition , headed by professor Jansen and captain Lecau discovers in the extreme northern part of Greenland the body of a man , very well preserved in the ice . Tuesday , February 3 The remains of French steamer " La Galante " , which disappeared near Spitzberg in 1905 are found not far from the body of the unknown man . The model of the man 's shoes corresponds to the date of the shipwreck . This means that the body of the Man of Ice has been a prisoner of the ice for 65 years . Friday , February 7 A helicopter of the expedition transports the isothermal container with the unknown man in his block of ice . Pull it up . We have a direct connection with the Polyken hospital for the press conference of professor Edouard Loriebat specialist in cryogenics . Professor Loriebat and professor Barkov head of the psychiatric ward of the hospital sit down to face journalists from all over the world . Ladies and gentlemen . I am now able to confirm to you certain rumours that have been going around since this afternoon . After 36 hours of progressive revitalisation Dr. Barkoff and I have detected renewed cardiac activity . That 's fantastic , don 't you think ? - It 's crazy . Crazy ! After a couple of hours , the metabolism has returned to normal and at this very moment the subject can be considered physically dehibernated . Dear oh dear . - That 's crazy . In 1905 , the " La Galand " vessel was transporting tonnes of glycerine . It is likely that upon the collision with an iceberg the body of the hibernating man was submerged in the product . It was snap frozen . The glycerine protected the cellular structure and prevented its collapse . It 's magnificent , don 't you think ? What ? They found the body of a man who disappeared 65 years ago ! They melt the ice and he comes back to life . Doesn 't that surprise you , Mr. Thomas ? Alright . Dear friends , let 's go back to the issue at hand . I will soon have been the President of the French packaging company for 25 years . I always only had one objective . To respect , to serve and to spoil my loyal clients . And also I 've wanted to make our production in Paris worthy of the European market . It 's necessary ... It 's necessary that the French firm ... Go ! ... that the French packaging company becomes ... tomorrow becomes the company of the future . I 'm only following the example of our good friend Crépin-Jaujard whose company is the pride of the French packaging industry . Dear friends . It 's not only an honour but also a great joy to me to announce , on the occasion of this modest inauguration the engagement plans of Evelyne , the daughter of Mr. Crépin-Jaujard and my little Didier . Dear Didier , who 's the son of my good friends , the De Tartas who 've done , who 've known who 've understood , who 've felt ... How shall I put it ? How do I tell you ? It 's hard to say . - You could also tell me tomorrow . Look at the cute little couple . To your health , my children . And be happy . Or it least try to be . Marriage is like a castle under siege . Attractive from the outside ... Counsel , please , the medal . The Legion of Honour . - Yes , the Legion of Honour . It 's been taken care of . - Thank you , dear counsel . And when will I get it ? - Last week . No , I mean when will I have it ? - Last week . I mean , I got mine last week . I don 't care about that . When will I have mine ? I spoke to important people . It 's imminent . But I want it tomorrow . Charles ! Should I offer ? - No . What 's that ? That 's the Legion of Honour . - He got it . You arranged that , didn 't you ? - No , no . Thanks for that , counsel . I need one for tomorrow . No , this one 's mine . Dear Hubert , what are you doing ? Do you mind if I call you Hubert ? - By all means . This is all really magnificent . Congratulations on the transformation . It 's going to work very well . You and I will achieve great things together . And our little ones will benefit from it . Tell me , though . I was thinking of that man . The hibernated man , 65 years . Amazing , isn 't it ? It 's unimaginable even . - Why is that ? He 's an old man at 25 years . - Ah yes . An old man of 25 . Let 's assume he has offspring . What faces will they pull ? They must be our age . I 'd like to see those looks . They 're in for quite a shock . They 'll be ... paf ! Sir ! - Yes ? The police are here , sir . What 's that ? - The police are here . Where ? - There . Sir . - Mr. de Tartas ? Yes , that 's me . - I have an urgent message for you . Yes , I knew about this . Thank you . Look here . Ministry of Internal Affairs , Secretary General . Mr. de Tartas , please . The Secretary General awaits you . Mr. Secretary General . - Dear Mr. Tartas . Such an honour . - Please . Have a seat . I 'm assuming , sir , that this invitation came as a surprise . I wasn 't expecting this honour , Mr. Secretary General . Of course , you must have heard of the concept of the hibernated man . I didn 't ... What was that ? I asked if you 've heard of the hibernated man . Yes , like everybody else . - The hibernated man has been identified . So much the better . But what has that got to do with me , Mr. Secretary General ? You know the family of the hibernated man . This family 's very close to you . Very close . Very close ? Which family ? Your own , sir . Mine ? - Yes , sir . Mr. Secretary General , my name is Hubert Barère de Tartas . I know my ancestors by their name ... first name and last name . Back to Louis VIII . Some died on the battle field , fighting barbarians . Others died a natural death in their châteaux . But I can guarantee you none of them died frozen in the ice of the North Pole . Indeed , sir , the hibernated man is not a De Tartas . His name is Paul Fournier . Fournier . Does that name ring a bell ? Fournier is a common name . Wasn 't your wife a Miss Fournier ? That 's possible , but you 're not trying to say , Mr. Secretary General that the hibernated man is related to my wife ? He 's her grandfather , sir . Excuse me , what did you say ? - He 's her grandfather . Mr. Secretary General , I love comedy , but I abhor jokes . Sir , in my circles , there is very rarely time for jokes . Quite something for our country , don 't you think ? If the hibernated man doesn 't die , France will have made the most amazing discovery . Survival ! What do you think ? Professor Loriebat is waiting for you in the hospital . Edmée ! What are you doing here ? - The signature , sir . This week 's cheque . Edmée ! Edmée ! Don 't yell like that . - Signature . Sign there . That 's what I was telling your husband . There , that 's it . Thank you . It 's that way . It was necessary ... you know ... for the week ... Come on , hurry . Listen . Where do you say your grandfather is ? Where do you think your grandfather is ? Which one ? - Grandfather Fournier . Strange question . Hubert , he 's been dead for a long time . Dead and buried . - Where ? In Dampierre , I think . I wish you were certain . - Listen Hubert , what 's gotten into you ? Well ? - I was very young when mummy died . I 've only been to the cemetery once or twice . So a mistake is quite possible . Let 's go to the cemetery . No . What does it matter to me ? - It matters to me , me ! Well , darling ? - I don 't remember . Try to remember . - Over there . Let 's go then . No , that 's not it . It 's in a lane . - There are lanes everywhere here . Listen , darling . You look over there and I look over here . No , no ... Hubert ! I found it . Wait . Grandmother Fournier is here . And grandfather ? He 's not there . She 's on her own . She 's alone ... Grandmother was a widow . Grandfather is somewhere else . I 'm certain , absolutely certain . - Certain of what ? Should I tell you where your grandfather is ? - Yes . He 's in an ice block and he 's been in there for 65 years . Does that ring a bell ? 65 years , ice block ? You 're telling me the hibernated man ... - Yes , that 's what I 'm telling you . Granny , grandfather 's back . Come with me . - Yes , I 'm coming . There is chicken in the fridge . Sophie will look after you . I 'm so emotional , knowing I 'm going to meet grandfather . Edmée ! Edmée ! Where 's your mother ? - In the garage . Look at granddaddy . Is that him ? - That 's granddaddy . That 's granddaddy , Sophie . - Not bad . You look after the little one . With pleasure , sir . - Edmée ! What does that old man want ? Yes , sir ? I heard Paul 's back . Paul who ? - Paul Fournier . Don 't start about that . I don 't know anything . He 's my oldest friend . - I don 't care . I 'm not talking to you . I 'm not talking to you . - Is he back or not ? Let me go , let me go . - I 'm not stopping your car . Yes , you are . - Put it in first gear . Let me go . I 'm still his oldest friend . We 're about to enter a sterile area . Madam . The slightest shock can endanger his mental stability but also his life . He 's still very sick . He thinks it 's 1905 . A final word ... He will have changed a lot . Who cares about appearances ? My heart will know . This is terrible . I 'm not a descendant of this monster . That 's impossible . Is that why you made us come here ? It 's not him . Look here . It 's not him . Sir , we need to calm down . - And then ? We 're going to shave him . Let 's wait for that . Shave him ? Well , shave then . We have everything we need here . Doctor Bibolini is one of our best psychiatrists . He supervises the psychological stability and the progressive re-adaptation of your relative . I 'm not yet sure if this man is my ancestor . But if he is , seeing that you left him in this condition makes me wonder : Why ? Because I thought he wasn 't ready yet for the decisive confrontation with himself . But this morning he asked for a mirror , so I decided the time had come . No objections , dear colleague ? Physically , he 's in good shape . The rest is up to you , dear colleague . Scissors . Does he remember what happened ? Little fragments of his family life , but before his marriage . He forgot about my grandmother ? - Apparently . We told him he fell of a horse and that he suffers from lapses of memory . Hubert , it 's him . It 's granddad . You 've given him back to me . Thank you , professor . Professor , what are you going to do with him ? What kind of question is that , Hubert ? We 're taking him home . Sorry , but that 's out of the question . He belongs to science . Indeed , indeed . - He belongs to his family first . Grandpa 's not a guinea pig . He 's a human being , sir . But darling , these gentlemen are right . He belongs to science , unfortunately . But madam , his reactions are unpredictable , moving . All humanity is concerned with his mental development . And his physical development . - Excuse me , but I don 't care . Edmée , think about it . Your grandfather thinks it 's 1905 . Here he can continue to think that , but at our place ... Surrounded by the love of his relatives , he 'll slowly find out , you 'll see . No , we won 't see . I 'm completely against the idea . It could lead to irreversible mental trauma . These gentlemen know their job . I accept it and so should you . Come on , angel . - You 'll see him soon . Besides , it 's not our fault . It 's the government 's decision . I don 't care about the government . - Shush ! What , sst ? I don 't care about the government . Attention , give me a nice smile . What do your parents think of the hibernated man ? Daddy hates this kind of publicity . Attention , don 't move . There . Mummy says it 's a disgrace . I think he 's quite interesting . - Interesting ? He 's amazing . I have a great-grandfather who 's my age . I think it 's sad . No , it 's the future . They freeze you when you 're 20 years old , pull you out when you 're 50 and you 're still 20 . Don 't you like that ? - Didier ! - Evelyne , I didn 't see you . We 're only young once . - For sure , dad . Your idiot son isn 't getting anywhere with Evelyne . As if he doesn 't realise I could really use the Crépin-Jaujard capital . Didier 's a bit young to get married . In the meantime , darling , I have an important request . I need your pretty little signature right here . I don 't care . I want my grandfather . You didn 't know he existed and now you can 't live without him . I 'm a family person . I 'll get you your grandfather . Now sign here , my angel . You 'll get everything you want when he 's here . Damn ! Don 't curse . I hate that . Let 's go to bed , darling . Everything will be alright . Are you dreaming , Hubert ? Charles got the spare bedroom ready for you . Damn ! - Good night , my friend . Good evening . Any news ? Sorry to call this late , but I was held up at the Palace of Justice . Tell me , about your hibernated man . I studied the case quite well . It 's a problem , isn 't it ? I know it 's a problem . Now what ? - It 's very simple , my friend . It 's a matter of absence . - What does the law say ? The law is quite clear . Paul Fournier. the hibernated man , is alive , isn 't he ? Therefore , he must regain all his possessions . What 's that ? - Everything belongs to him . How can everything belong to him ? I 'll object to that . You can 't do anything without his consent . That 's impossible . - I 'm very sorry , but that 's how it is . There must be something we can do . Excuse me , but I have two very urgent files I need to study . Blast ! Edmée ! Open up ! I 'm asleep . - You were right , it 's a disgrace . Open up ! I 'm asleep . - I 'll give you your grandfather . I love him . He 's so likeable . I can 't live without him anymore . Edmée , open up ! My sweetheart ! I 'm asleep . Professor , I demand that you give me the grandfather of my wife . Impossible . - I didn 't hear that . What ? I said it 's impossible . - Be very careful . The press are outside . I 'll sue . Sue them for what ? - Arbitrary sequestration . Dear sir , for the hibernated man , it 's 1905 . You 're not yet born . You don 't exist . And you may never exist . Sir , there 's somebody waiting for you . Why didn 't you tell me ? - I did tell you . When ? - Just now . - You 're a liar . Hello , doctor . - Mr. de Tartas we have the duty to prevent Loriebat from making a mistake that could be fatal . What ? I don 't understand . - Have a seat . Fatal for what ? I 'm convinced that Loriebat is mistaken . Certainly . - Wait . If we want Fournier to regain mental stability we have to put him in a family situation right away . That 's what I 've been saying . - Let me continue . This morning , Professor Loriebat obtained official permission to transfer him to a nursing home in the province . Why leave him to strangers ? When we can help with our enormous ... - Listen to me . He will be transferred tomorrow . We must act fast . I can 't do it alone and I can only trust you . Doctor , I 'm awaiting your orders . We gained 5 minutes on our time schedule . When he wakes up , he won 't even know he 's in a different room . This morning he was asking if he could go home . We can 't start listening to the patients . - You don 't leave us much choice in this case . Professor . Hubert , I don 't feel well . I think I 'm going to faint . Listen to me . It 's complicated enough as it is . I don 't feel well . - No , not on the stretcher . Not on the stretcher ! Breathe , Edmée . Edmée , do you feel better ? Do you feel better ? Ok ! - No ! Enough ! That 's too much . Have a word with my assistant , before you leave . Please , gentlemen . I 'm thirsty . I feel like a big , cold beer . How about you ? That 's it . Let 's go . Let go of me . Let go of me . No ! Stop ! No more oxygen for you . Grab the stretcher . Come on ! Doctor , you 're all alone . Help me with him . Enough ! Enough ! Let go ! Is everything ok ? - Yes , fine . Quite an escape , no ? How far is it to your lodge ? - What ? How far is it to your lodge ? - About 20 minutes . Does he really think it 's 1900 ? - What ? Does he really think it 's 1900 ? Yes , yes , it 'll be fine . - Hurry , Hubert , he 's coming to . Look at that . - Look at that ? You said we had half an hour . Well , he 's not a watch . We 're having a problem now . No , it 'll be alright . Help ! Where are you going , idiot ? - Look at that ! Look at them ! Where am I ? What happened ? - You fell off your horse . My horse ? What was I doing on a horse ? Have patience . Your memory will come back . The year is 1905 . Sara Bernhardt was excellent last night . And Mr. Loubet is still the president . No , it 's not true . They wouldn 't dare ! Let go of me . - Come on . Come on . I 'm Professor Loriebat . - Of course . Leave me in peace . I 'm Professor Loriebat ! Mr. Director , Mr. Director ! Hurry ! Be reasonable . - I want to get up . He 's very agitated . Where 's Professor Loriebat ? He was supposed to accompany him . He 's here ! Let go of me , please . - Professor ! I don 't understand what happened . - I do . Where 's the telephone ? Where 's the phone ? Considering the era , we thought that a telephone ... Enough of that ! Quickly call the police and the army . What 's going on , Professor ? - What 's going on ? They stole the hibernated man . You must have taken a wrong turn . - You told me to turn right . That 's it . - Now we 're in trouble . Come here . Keep it up . He 's gone , he 's gone . Where is he ? No , he 's here . - Where ? Ambulance car . Suspect behaviour . Tries to avoid the road blocks . Immediate intervention ? Alright . They saw us . We 're lost . - We 're not lost . Where are we ? I lost track . - Hurry , Hubert , he 's waking up . We have to keep him at all cost . Doctor , look ! No , don 't do that . Hold him . Hold him well . Give him this . Give him the pill . A church is timeless . When he wakes up , he won 't feel out of place . Yes , that 's true . Don 't you like it ? Don 't you have anything else ? - No . Hubert , look . No , there . Fromantines Monastery 15th century Everybody get out . Line yourselves up . So you won 't let me in . Attention ! - Give me that . Doctor Bibolini , Mr. de Tartas ! I give you 15 minutes . The grave act you 've committed deserves punishment . Be reasonable so the penalty will be less severe . I 'm waiting for your reply . He 's asleep . We can leave . - You forgot that we 're surrounded . No . Don 't you have an underground tunnel ? A secret door ? Too late . Better hand him over to the authorities . Why ? What 's that ? He doesn 't belong to them . He belongs to his family . Right , father ? Not anymore , my son . He belongs to God . You want to keep him ? - By miraculously saving his life and by leading you to our house the Lord has clearly expressed His will . This man 's destiny belongs to the Lord . May prayer bring us light . For God 's sake ! He 's making fools of us . I 'm sorry , Professor . All we can do is guard the perimeter . Ok , I 'll go alone then . Help me . - It 's too late . This was your idea so help me . What 's the point ? - And you too , Edmée . Careful ! - What is it ? I can hear somebody walking . - Who is it ? Quickly , against the wall . It 's him . - No , no . It 's him . - No , it 's not him . I can feel I 'm about to lose it . - Oh no ! I 'm going to lose it . I 'm sorry to disturb your meditation , but ... I know you 've pledged a vow of silence ... - I 'm losing it . Bibolini ! I lost it . Mummy . My little boy . - Mummy , I want to go home . I want to go home . Right now . Ok , I give in . His well-being comes first . The family home , alright . But in 1905 . But Professor , do you really want to put him up in my hotel ? I didn 't hear that . - I said of course . The hotel was built in 1900 . Do you think he 'll recognize it ? It 's simple . Return the hotel to its original state . I can 't hear a word . - I was only saying that you should return the hotel to the state it was in at the start of the century . But I spent a fortune on modernising it . We made all these transformations . The paint is still wet . Since your ancestor can 't adapt to our times our times have to adapt to him . Tell me . I have an idea . Why don 't we tell him right away which year it really is . Would be cheaper . That would kill him . No , never ! - What did I do ? You were shaking your big head and thinking the unspeakable . My dear , I don 't have a big head and I wasn 't shaking it . Yes , you do have a big head and you were shaking it . Ok , I have a big head , but I didn 't shake it . Yes , you did . - What do you call shaking ? When you go like this . - No , this is shaking . This is shaking . And I didn 't shake . Enough . Whether you like it or not , grandfather will live with us . We have received orders to make sure nothing ruins the experience . Orders from high up . I don 't agree ! I don 't agree ! Mr. de Tartas ! - I don 't agree ! What makes a country great these days ? - I don 't care . You don 't have the right . What makes a country great is outer space . I don 't care . - I won 't allow it . What makes a country great these days , is outer space . And outer space without hibernation is useless . In the long run , Mars and Venus won 't be enough . We 'll go further . That means voyages of one or two centuries , maybe thousands of years . For a voyage like that , the astronauts would have to be hibernated . We 'll be the hibernation experts . You 'll be the expert , Mr. de Tartas . What if I refuse ? - What about France ? I forbid you ! - What ? You said you don 't care . - No , I didn 't . Besides , I don 't see the problem . Everything will be paid for you . Inside the house , the interior design of the period has been restored . Completely identical ? Furniture could have changed a bit during the absence of the hibernated man . What if he wants to get out ? His convalescence demands that he stays within the confines of the property . What about cars ? Modern traffic is no longer allowed in the surroundings . People living in the area have been given cars from the right period . Others are only allowed in if in possession of an official pass . Because of their timeless outfits , coal merchants , clergymen and nuns are allowed in . Letters with 2 cents postage will be delivered by bikes and a few kiosks are selling newspapers from the period . When can we finally see him ? - Soon , gentlemen , soon . Excuse me . We had to give him an injection for the trip and we don 't know how he 'll react when he 'll wake up . It 'll go very well . I agree that my wife looks a lot like his grandmother . But I don 't look like the father at all . There is a certain likeness , though . Don 't comb . There 's nothing to comb . You 're awake . Why did everything change here ? - I 'll call madam . I 'm not complaining , by the way . You 're much more beautiful than old , ugly Irma . You too , sir . I mean ... - What 's your name , beautiful child ? Sophie , sir . - Sophie . I think that we 're going to become very good friends , you and me . You have to stay in bed . You 're sick . Sick , me ? I never woke up feeling this good . You must be losing your mind . - That 's possible . But does it matter ? - Let go of me . I have my orders . - From now on , you get them from me . Anyway I 'd never want to inflict any pain on these beautiful eyes . Bring me some bread and some cocoa . I 'm starving . Yes , sir . Madam ! - My dear , what a voice . He woke up . - He woke up ? Completely ? He 's full of life . - My God ! My God . - Excuse me . Here 's your pen . Mrs. de Tartas ? - Professor , he 's awake ! Has he seen his father ? - Not yet . Go get him . I 'll prepare his entrance . - Hubert , he 's awake ! If you want to see him , finish getting dressed . I 'm fed up . It 's all about him . And I 've been kicked out of my room . But you 're next to mine , no ? - Did he talk to you ? Yes , with his hands . - The dirty old man ! He aged well , you know . How is my big boy ? - You 're looking great today , mum . He 's in good shape , isn 't he , Professor ? Come with me . It 'll go very well . Excellent transformation . A perfect illusion . Really . Congratulations . - Thank you . Tell me ... What ? - Did he mention his father ? No , not at all . - Is that bad ? Don 't worry . It will be fine . Yes . It 's a problem . We can 't cause him any shock . What shock ? - Take it easy . Don 't worry , I 'm telling you . Go in . Paul ... my little Paul . You haven 't forgotten your daddy ? Come in my arms , my son . Out ! Out ! Terrible person , villain ! Ruffian , get out ! Get out ! - But darling , it 's daddy ! Let go of me ! I never want to see you again . I never want to see you again ! - Darling , calm down . Let go of me . Let him through . Dear sir , you can save me . Save me , dear sir . Who are you ? - Don 't you recognize me ? Look . Unbelievable ! Miserable creature ! How did you dare ? How did you dare come back ? - What 's wrong with you ? A man who leaves his home for an actress ? It wasn 't me . - Get up . Man , look . Look ! Think about it . I 'd be more than a 100 years old . Yes , that 's impossible . My apologies , sir . How can we receive him after what he did . What he did to you , mummy . From now on , I 'll be looking after you . Let 's forget about all that . I 'll take you to Maxim . Oh no ! Gentlemen , I 've seen enough of you . Please give me your bills and then be kind enough to leave . But promise not to leave the house . - I 'll make sure of that . He 's making good progress , in spite of the incident with the father . Gentlemen , your idea was excellent . - Where are you going ? I said , where are you going . - Well , home . I don 't think so . The experiment was a failure . Where do you want me to go then . A hotel ? - That 's a very good idea . It 's the only solution . - I 'm going home ! Listen , gentlemen . In the interest of our relationship ... I only want what 's good for the patient . - I don 't care about the patient . No , he 's my husband . There are limits . He caused this himself , mummy . You 're divorced . Forget about him . But Paul , he 's your father . - He betrayed us . Let 's not speak of him again . It would come in handy . Mummy , the cops are arresting daddy . - What are you saying , young man ? You 're making a silly mistake . I guess you were thinking you were at home . I 'm sorry . What was I thinking ? He 's a young student who rents a room in the attic . He 's preparing for the academy . - Very well , young man . But I think your behaviour is rather impolite . Don 't tell him off . He 's cute . Sophie , please . But Mr. Paul is even cuter . - Sophie ! The little one has taste . - I don 't think so . People often talked about you , but you don 't impress me much . Didier ! I mean young man ! I beg your pardon . I 'll kick him out tomorrow . - No , you can 't do that . I understand your loneliness , mummy . You 're young , beautiful ... Yes , yes , beautiful . You 're very attractive . You 're facing many temptations . Some of which are dangerous . You don 't mind me saying that ? - No , grandfather . See ? You 're laughing at me . - No . Mummy , you should get married again . Funny you should say that . I was just thinking about it . Have you got someone in mind ? I don 't dare talk about it , but I think so . - Really ? Do I know him ? Introduce him to me . I want to make sure he 's worthy of you . I 'll be very critical . Sir , excuse me . Excuse me , sir , who are you ? Don 't you recognize me ? Sorry , when you get angry , I recognize you , Mr de Tartas . Where 's the lady ? She 's in the winter garden . Announce me . - Yes . It must make you feel young to be courting her . Announce me . - Alright , who should I announce ? Guess . - I don 't know . Mr. de Tartos . - De Tartos ? De Tartas , idiot . - De Tartas idiot ... The name 's the same . Just this ... - Go ! Charles , come here . Yes , what 's the problem ? How do I look ? Ok , that 's enough . Get lost . Sophie , come here . No , leave that alone . - Alright , I 'll tell him to come . Mr. de Tartas , you can come here . Mr. de Tartas ! - Your servant , dear madam . Welcome in this house . - Sir . I 've spoken highly of you to Paul and he couldn 't wait to meet you . You 're too kind , madam . I brought you a modest token of my devotion . See how much he spoils me ? You shouldn 't have . Such beautiful flowers . Aren 't they too heavy ? Not at all . Sophie ! She 'll be here in a second . That 's alright . - Put that on the table . Love 's beautiful . - Keep your comments to yourself . Indeed , dear sir , love 's a noble sentiment provided it 's sincere and profound . Mummy deserves to be happy and I 'll make sure that she is . Paul , listen ... - I 'm sure the gentleman understands . Very clearly . - Step into my study , please . Will you excuse me , mummy ? - Certainly , my darling . What ? - Excuse me ? I thought ... nothing . - Very well . This way ? - Yes , this way . Be indulgent with Paul , dear friend . He adores me and can sometimes be a bit brusque . Through that door . Have a seat , please . A glass of Madeira ? - No , thanks . A bit of Grenache ? - No , thank you . Are you on a diet ? - No , not at all . Health problems ? Sensitive stomach ? Weak liver ? No , I 'm fine , I assure you . I 'm alright . Excellent . A cigar ? - No , I don 't smoke . Not anymore . You 're a very virtuous man . Mr. de Tartas , I won 't beat around the bush . My mother told me you 're a widow . Yes , yes . - What did your wife die of ? What did your wife die of ? Yes , yes , I heard you . It was terrible . Horrible . Already in the morning , she wasn 't well . And I remember ... Her breathing ... and then one moment ... Horrible . What a story . - Terrible . Explosion ... everywhere . Horrible . She didn 't suffer . Not at all . Mr. de Tartas , I like a clean situation . Me too . Me too . - You intend to marry my mother , don 't you ? Yes . - I wouldn 't like you to hurry things . You can live here for a while . - That 's too kind of you . You 've been very important for the factory . But from now on , I 'll be in charge . But that 's not possible . But ... and what about you ? What will happen to you ? How will you go about it ? My dad only did one thing right . He left the factory in my name . I 'm young . I 'll take charge . You should be careful . The doctors said to take it easy . You 'll get tired . You 'll get tired . They 're idiots . - You 'll have problems with the material . Administrative and financial problems . Cheques to sign . I 'll sign them . - No , you can 't sign cheques . Do you think I 'm not capable ? - Let 's not ... Listen , give me a big glass of Grenache and a big Madeira in a big glass , with a big cigar . Attention , please . This big step back in time is touching , don 't you think ? It 's ludicrous . Such an effort for a commoner is unbelievable . If he 's so common , why do you bother ? For you , darling . Don 't you want to see Didier ? Of course , mummy . That 's the only reason . Not curiosity or snobbism . There he is . He 's watching . Still watching . He 's gone . He thinks he inherited an oil lamp factory . Make sure he doesn 't get involved or we 'll have a big problem . What do you want to do ? - Tell him the truth . Enough of this comedy . He 's back . He 's there . You shouldn 't test my patience . - Without my family you 're nothing . I won 't need them for much longer . Didier will marry Evelyne . And you can stay with your grandfather . Hubert ! Hubert , I 'm getting dizzy . - Higher ! Hubert , I 'm getting dizzy . I 'm getting dizzy . Dear friends ! Are you injured ? - No . Not at all . - Is everything alright ? Everything 's fine . We were waiting for you . After you . - That way , please . Charming . - Do you think so ? Hubert , I thought we were arguing . - Your dress is torn . They 're charming . And after 20 years of marriage . Evelyne would be lucky if their son 's like them . Charles , where 's Didier ? Impossible ! Let me ! What are you doing here ? What are you doing in Didier 's room ? To believe I trusted you . - But it 's not a crime . It 's worse . It 's an assault . Get lost . I don 't know if the boss will agree . - I am the boss . No , it 's Mr. Paul . Miserable person . Do you want to ruin your father ? The Crépin-Jaujards are downstairs . Evelyne 's waiting for you . Go . Listen to me really well . I 'm fed up with the Crépin-Jaujards . Fed up ? - Yes , up to here . And that 's not all . You can forget about that fake marriage . No , I 'll never do that . Never ! And now go ! The Crépin-Jaujards . I can 't wait to meet him . I 'm afraid to make a mistake . Would it be that bad ? It would be terrible . - Charles , please . But it would be terrible . - Charles , leave us . It would be terrible . It could ruin everything . Please be careful . - Keep an eye on me , Edouard . I 've been doing that for 19 years , darling . Where is your grandfather ? - Patience , he 'll be here . I didn 't picture you like this at all . When I think of your age ... Do you find me too young ? - No , I think you 're just fine . Here 's our little Didier . - Bravo , Didier , excellent . My respect , madam , sir . Is something wrong with him ? - No , no . Is anything wrong ? - No , nothing . Really nothing ? - Really nothing . And where 's little Evelyne ? I thought Didier was in the park . She 's looking for him . I 'll go . - Yes ... No , I 'll go myself . What 's wrong , Hubert ? Are you ill ? - Charles . Did you see Evelyne ? - Charles . You didn 't see Evelyne ? - Charles ! I 'm here . - Give me a big glass of Grenache . A big glass . And a little cigar . What were you thinking ? Maybe Paul was just gallant towards Evelyne . Crépin-Jaujard and I agree about the date of the wedding . Everything 's going well then . - Everything 's not going well . I won 't let your grandfather kidnap my son 's fiancée . What are you doing ? What do you mean ? Well , yes , what are you doing ? Well , I 'm ... Why ? Oh no ! We 're only engaged . We 're not married yet . We don 't want people talking . All these emotions must have gotten to you . You don 't love me anymore . I do . - You don 't . - I do . My darling , I 'm alone , all alone , too alone . Alright , here . Yes , but ... - Wait . Here , to keep you company . But nobody must know . No . But Edmée ... My respect , madam . May you have a good night . Edmée ... Did Paul see anything ? - No . If he had seen you in my room , he would have killed you . He thought I came to say goodnight . - Thank you for your presence of mind . Charming complicity which reminds me of our courting days . Your father 's youth has given us back a bit of our own . Hubert , it 's late . Yes , it 's really late . It 's never too late for courting one 's wife , my darling . Enough . - My darling ... This can 't go anywhere . - My darling ... Mummy ? Mummy ! What is it ? - It 's me . Can I come in ? - No ! Hubert . - What ? - One moment . Hubert . - Who 's that ? Wake up . - What is it ? For goodness ' sake . - Who is it ? What ? Where ? You can come in , darling . Mummy , tell me if you like this poem . My life depends on it . Do you never get tired ? - No . Listen to me . For Evelyne ... We 've loved each other since we first met and already this image that has appeared to haunt my mind on this bleak morning . It 's an image of you , my darling ... Read , little darling , read . Come back , my dear friend , without you I am nothing ... If you still so want , you can be mine tomorrow . In front of the Lord , in his temple I shall hand you my life and my heart . Don 't you like it ? I do . It 's charming . But you get all excited , yet she isn 't available . I think there is somebody ... a decent boy even . I 'll kill him . - I forbid you . Alright . I 'm too happy to hurt your feelings . I 'll tell Charles to send my letter . What do you say to that ? He 's insisting . Please , Hubert . It 's 5 o 'clock in the morning . I 'll nip this romance in the bud . Such horror . What 's he doing ? This is new . Dear Charles , I need your help . At this hour ? Have pity on your staff . Smile , Charles , life 's beautiful . - Is it ? He 's quite a nuisance . Now he doesn 't sleep anymore . He slept in advance . - Where are you going ? To make sure he doesn 't send this love letter . I 'm nipping this romance in the bud . Sophie , I 'll give you a raise of 40 francs . You too , Charles . You 're sensational , sir . - Sensational ? That 's a new way of putting it . - Didn 't they say that in your time ? In my time ? - I mean , before your accident . Bravo , I see you 're recovering well . - Very well , thank you . Dear Sophie . - Sophie . What 's with the eccentric outfit ? - They 're pyjamas . I 'm definitely a bit behind . - If only you knew . Charles , quickly mail this letter . - Now ? - It 's urgent . I have to do it now ? - Yes , and smile . A lady ? - Yes . She 's wonderful , beautiful . And without leaving this place ? I 'm impressed . Give it to me . - No . Give it to me . - No . Give it to me . - It 's not for you . I 'll take care of it. is Mr. Didier there ? - Yes . - Good . Let me ... - I 'll hit you . If you still so want , you can be mine tomorrow . In front of the Lord , in his temple I shall hand you my life and my heart . Did you write that ? That 's hard to believe . I knew you 'd laugh at me . My dad wanted me to read it to you . You clearly don 't know me very well . That 's my poem . - Aren 't you ashamed ? But she 's my fiancée , isn 't she ? - How dare you say that . You have some great ideas . Is something wrong , my darling ? I 'm fed up with all this , fed up with Evelyne , with the entire family . Didier ! - He 's 70 years older than her . How would Crépin-Jaujard look ? - Calm down , darling , you 're sweating . Sophie , run a bath for Didier . - Alright , we 'll have a bath together . Didier ! What 's happening , Hubert ? - The boat 's sinking . Our feet are getting wet . Paul and Evelyne , does that continue ? - Like a house on fire . But we should talk to the girl . - Exactly , you look after Evelyne . I 'll look after him . I 'll dehibernate him . No , no , don 't do that . - I 'll tell him everything . I 'll tell him everything . - No . Paul ! How do you feel ? What ? - How do you feel ? Get lost . Get lost or I 'll hit you . How do you feel ? Good ? Let 's go . And now I 'll tell you everything . - No ! - Shut up ! You think it 's 1905 ? Well , no . It 's 1970 . North Pole . Does that ring a bell ? You were frozen in a block of ice for 65 years . And two months ago , they found you in one piece . Hubert ! - Shut up ! You 're not 25 years old . You 're 90 years old . 90 years . And you 're the grandfather of your mother . My wife . Her name 's not Clementine . It 's Edmée . Edmée , Edmée , Edmée ... Her name 's Edmée ... I 'll show you ... It 's not finished . Get lost you all . Ok , North Pole . You never had a horse riding accident . No ? - Never . You shipwrecked . Facing death , you filled up on whiskey and fell in the glycerine . Glice ... - The only other thing you needed was ice . For the whiskey . - No . Thanks to the whiskey , the glycerine and the ice , you 're still among us . I see . - Don 't look like that . Well ? Get lost you all . Don 't look up there . Lots of things happened in 65 years . The war of 1914 . Paf ! The war of 1940 . Paf ! The polka , the mazurka , no more . Everything 's electric now . Even guitars . Are you ok ? Doing alright ? Listen . Airplanes ... How fast do you think they go ? - 80 km per hour . Poor boy . 2800 km per hour . Shaped like a cigar and zoof ! Twice the speed of sound . You arrive in New York before you leave Paris . Because of the time difference , of course . - Of course . Of course . What do you think of that ? - It must use a lot of petrol . Petrol 's history . It 's kerosene . Until we get atomic propulsion . Atomic , neutomic . We 're going to the moon now . We 're going to the moon with an insect . - An insect ? Yes , an insect ... a module . An insect module . It 's insane . People are going mad . Mad ! And I want to go mad . Hubert ! - I told him everything . Why did you do that ? - I told him everything . How do you feel ? - Me ? Fine . I am fine . - You don 't believe me . - Yes , yes . He doesn 't believe me . - Yes , I do . I believe you . I 'm 90 years old . I 'm your grandfather . I 'm from the North Pole and we all go to the moon with an insect . He doesn 't believe me . Television . - No . He 'll see a television . - No , I don 't want ... Stay away or I 'll hit you . What are you saying ? - I 'll hit you . Where 's the key ? The key , the key . Here , sir . Give it to me . Hubert ! Hubert ! So it 's true . How is it possible ? I would have liked to tell you in a different way . It 's better to live in your time . Do you think you could get used to ours ? I don 't know . We talk differently about love . But nothing has really changed . Come . Where are you going ? - To make up for lost time . Paul ! This is crazy . - Accept it . He doesn 't belong to us anymore . Children , it 's terrible . We still can 't find Hubert . Mrs. de Tartas , your husband asked us to give you this . I 'll see you in 50 years . Hubert .

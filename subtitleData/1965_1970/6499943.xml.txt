 ( Thunder booming ) ( Engine revving ) ( Footsteps echoing ) ( Thunder booming ) ( No audio ) ( Thunder booming ) Prisoner : Where am I ? Woman : In the village . What do you want ? Information . Whose side are you on ? That would be telling . We want information . Information ... You won 't get it . ( Bubbling ) By hook or by crook ... We will . Who are you ? The new number two . Who is number one ? ( Chuckling ) You are number six . I am not a number , I am a free man ! ( Number two laughs ) Shouldn 't you be doing this in the hospital ? I know what I 'm doing . What about number two ... has it been agreed ? I 'll take the responsibility . If we wait for orders , we 'll never get results . I hope you do know what you 're doing . ( Shimmering electronic noise ) Noise gets much louder ) They always do that ... don 't worry . He 'll be all right . You know the instructions about number six . If any damage is done ... He 'll talk before that happens . Ah , it 's going to work . I knew it would . ( Phone beeping ) It 's a bore , old man ... the committee . They want a breakdown on all we know . You , me , Arthur , the colonel , everybody . Suspected security leak , apparently . All the files you 've seen the projects you know about ... just headings , not details . This phone is scrambled and I 've got a recorder ... might as well tell me now . You ... You must ... not ... ask me that . I 'm not ... it 's the committee that 's asking . I 'm not ... it 's the committee that 's asking . Who 's that ? Who ? Who is that ? It 's Dutton ... hello , are you there ? It 's Dutton . Hello , are you there ? You must stop ... you 'll damage the brain , then we 'll ... Number two : Stop ! Get him back to the hospital . Number six was about to talk . Don 't you believe it . He 'd have died first . You can 't force it out of this man . He 's not like the others . I would have made him talk . Every man has his breaking point . I don 't want him broken . He must be won over . It may seem a long process to your practical mind but this man has a future with us . There are other ways . Number two ( Over intercom ) : Good morning . It 's another lovely day , so rise and shine . Life 's for living . How did I sleep ? Sound as a bell . Have a nice day . Feel free . ( Motor chugging ) Yes . Splendid . Oh , he 'll be no trouble ... just a matter of time . Tomorrow night ... we 're preparing for it now . Yes , I wish you could come , too . Good morning . Don 't tell me that time travel is in it as well . A woman is always impatient to wear a new dress . How do I look ? Different from the others . The maids come and they go . We 'll get along . I 'm sure you get along with everybody . I 've got a good mind to report you . I 'm new here . Special delivery . Sign your number here , number six . ( Carnival music playing ) ( Bell ' ringing ' ) ( Carnival music continues ) ( Bell ' ringing ' ) ( Music continues ) Number two : I see you 've made a friend . You 've got your invitation to the carnival tomorrow ? It 's one of our little traditions . Each year , there 's a fancy dress and a ball in the evening . We 're promised a cabaret this year . You 'll come ? I have a choice ? You do as you want . As long as it 's what you want . As long as it is what the majority wants . We 're Democratic ... In some ways . ( Carnival music continues ) Morning , my dears . No game is worth playing if you can 't win . That 's not very English , I know . Are you ... English ? What you should do is find yourself a nice , young lady at the carnival . You 're too independent . Now , they 're pretty and unattached . What about her ? Quite unsuitable . I 'm independent . Don 't forget . Don 't go . I must . There 's a reason . Reason ? Number two wants you to go ... Or does she ? Am I playing her game or yours ? Nof mine . Don 't mind me . Go if you like . How long have you been here ? Questions are a burden to others ... answers a prison for oneself . What did you do to have yourself brought here ? Questions are a burden ... And answers a prison for oneself . I must go . ( Creaking zap ) Man : Are you all right ? You tried to go in . By mistake ? It 's fussy about who it lets in . This is the town hall . He tried to follow you . It 's hardly my fault . Funny , though , your being his observer . Woman : Remember , keep a sharp watch . Tss ! ( Meows ) Hello . You 've turned up again , have you , hmm ? Maid : Have a good walk ? ( Cat meows ) Maid : Where did you find it ? It found me . You 're not allowed animals . It 's a rule . Rules to which I am not subject . Then I 'll take it with me . You might get scratched . Where does it come from ? How does it get here ... the milk , the ice cream ? The potatoes and the aspirins ... at night , when everyone 's asleep ? I 've never seen a night . I just sleep . ( Loud grinding ) Supposing I don 't want any flowers . Everybody has flowers ... for carnival tomorrow . Be seeing you . Drink it while it 's hot . What is it ? It 's good for you . Good for someone . Be seeing you . And you . ( Ticking ) You 're late . There 's a lot to do . Are you going in ? To make my report . Does it concern me and number six ? No ... we 'll overlook that and put it down to ... enthusiasm . Oh , thank you . Uh , could you get me a directive about Dutton ? He 's being rather difficult . ( Snapping fingers ) ( Snapping fingers ) ( Snapping fingers ) Woman : Sleep . Sleep . Sleep . That 's it . Sleep softly until tomorrow ... Lovely , gentle sleep and a lovely tomorrow . ( Loud beep ) ( Beep ) Has he ? Don 't worry . It 'll test our efficiency . ( Loud whirring ) ( Electronic tone pulsating ) ( Tone fading ) ( Waves crashing ) He 'll eventually go back to his room . It 's the only place he can ever go . ( Seagulls calling ) ( Clicks on ) ( Static crackling ) ( Clicks off ) Ringing e man : A proclamation ! All citizens take notice that carnival is decreed for tonight . Turn back the clock . There will be music , dancing , happiness all at the carnival by order . ( Villagers cheering , band playing lively tune ) ( Music still playing ) Maid : You didn 't sleep here last night . I thought I 'd save you the trouble of making up the bed . Where 's the fancy costume ? They 've given me a new dress ... Something special tonight . And the cat ? Gone . I didn 't make it . Everyone 's having a good time outside . You wait until tonight . Do you mean we 're allowed out after hours ? Anyone would think you were locked in , the way you talk . Oh , your costume came . Yes . Don 't I get a choice ? Other people choose . It 's a game . I expected something exotic . What is it ? My own suit ... specially delivered for the occasion . What does that mean ? That I 'm still ... myself . Lucky you . ( Music still playing outside ) ( Static crackling ) What are we to do with him ? Number two : There you go again . You mustn 't be so eager , doctor . Your techniques are efficient but not always beneficial . Number six will yet be of great value . He can 't do as he likes . He 's an individual and they 're always trying . Don 't worry . His observer will ring me the moment he puts a bomb in your lovely hospital . Incidentally , how 's progress with Dutton ? Well , he 's given me quite a lot of information but he 's reluctant to go any further . I 'm afraid I 'll have to be more extreme . Of course I 'll win in the end . I always do . Rather a small fish , you know . Still , it 'll give you an opportunity to experiment . After all , he is expendable . ( Clicks on ) ( Indistinct transmission of man 's voice ) Man : Nowhere is there more beauty than here . Tonight when the moon rises , the whole world will turn to silver . Do you understand ? It is important that you understand . I have a message for you . You must listen . The appointment cannot be fulfilled . Other things must be done tonight . If our torment is to end , if liberty is to be restored we must grasp the nettle even though it makes our hands bleed . Only through pain can tomorrow be assured . Number two : You were right , my dear I 'm too old for these stairs . Where did you get it ? Does it work ? Woman ( Over radio ) : That practice dictation was at 60 words a minute . Now , here is a passage from the wartime memoirs . ( Clicks off ) Hardly useful . The view 's lovely from here . I 'm sad , number six . I thought you were beginning to ... Give in ? Be happy . Everything you want is here . Everything 's elsewhere . Don 't force me to take steps . We indulge any member of our community for a time . After that ... Yes , I know , I 've been to the hospital . I 've seen . You 've seen only a fraction . I know where you stand , don 't I ? She 's one of our best observers . We have one each ? Only our more fractious children . Shall we go down ? Suit yourself . You 're not thinking of jumping ? Never . Good . I have my duty . To whom ? To everyone . It 's the rules : Of the people , by the people , for the people . It takes on a new meaning . You 're a wicked man . Wicked ? You have no values . Different values . You won 't be helped . Destroyed . You want to spoil things . I won 't be a goldfish in a bowl . I must go . I may see you later ? Can you avoid it ? I hope it 's all right , the radio . What would you do ? Report on it , ask for instructions . Number one ? Yes . Who ? No ! Tell me . It 's all I know , all there is to know . In the place where you work ? Don 't keep asking me questions . ( Water dripping ) To whoever may find this ... Number two ? I can 't find number six . That 's no way to report . I 've tried everywhere . Don 't worry , he 'll turn up . It 's only a matter of time . He 's very undisciplined . Shall I watch number 34 instead ? No , he 's dead . Dead ? When ? It 's none of our business . I got to know him quite well . He didn 't know you , did he ? You . You , of all people . I 'd never have believed it . Roland ... Walter ... Dutton . Who was he ? His body was washed up on the shore . How long have you been here ? You don 't know ? Would I ask ? It 's difficult to say . A couple of months . And you ? Quite recently . How 's London ? About the same . Yes . Places don 't change . Only people . Some people . I want to talk about it anyway . Let 's go inside . I told them . What ? Everything I know . The irony of it is , they don 't believe me . You know I didn 't have access to the vital stuff . Yes . They 'll take me back to the hospital and by the time they realize I 'm telling the truth it 'll be too late . When ? They 've released me for 72 hours so that I can reconsider in the peaceful atmosphere of the ... Of the village . Still hope . No , my friend . Not for me . Such noble thoughts are long dead . Soon , roland Walter Dutton will cease to exist . Number two : You 're waiting for someone , Mr. tuxedo ? Or expecting someone ? Mr. Peter Pan ? So it seems . With his shadow ? You 're being hostile again . What were you looking at ? A light . A star . A boat . An insect . A plane . A flying fish . Somebody who belongs to my world . This is your world . I am your world . If you insist on living a dream you may be taken for mad . I like my dream . Then you are mad . Now go on up to the town hall . May I ? You may enter tonight . It 's carnival . Number two : What ? No dancing ? Tonight 's for dancing . Amongst other things . ( Crowd murmuring ) Number two : Music . Come along . You 've been practicing long enough . And dance . Enjoy yourselves . It 's carnival . I rarely drink . Then you 'll enjoy it all the more . Self-denial 's a great sweetener of pleasure . It 's warmer than we think . Undoctored . To carnival . Your administration is effective though you have no opposition . An irritation we 've dispensed with . Even its best friends agree democracy is remarkably inefficient . It 's ' 53 . How impressive . From here on , of course we degenerate to the ' 55 and the ' 57 and if people really misbehave themselves to a quite extraordinary ' 58 . Why haven 't I a costume ? Perhaps because you don 't exist . Quite en-chant-ing . Little Bo-peep . Who always knows where to find her sheep . Oh , you must cheer him up , my dear . Dance ... it 's a special night . We hope so . Dance . A glass of wine , doctor ? Ah , drink is too leveling . How is he ? Still rebellious , but it will pass . Without treatment ? We don 't want to spoil him . Unless we must . ( Playing baroque tune ) ( Drunkenly ) : Uh , how many of these have you been to ? This is my first and last . Don 't be silly . Yes ... who 's saying that , you or the computer ? Me . Don 't stop , dance . Oh , don 't behave like a human being . It might just confuse people . Only you were confused . Though not for long . There are treatments for people like you . I 'm terribly sorry . She , uh ... she must get instructions . Who do they come from ? Is he here tonight ? The man behind the big door ? Well , there 's no need to know . This place has been going for a long time . Since the war ? Before the war ? Which war ? ! A long time . ( Music ends ) ( Dancers applaud ) ( Baroque air begins ) Have you seen her ? Number two . She 's not at the party ? I 'll be seeing her . She must see this urgently ... it 's a termination order . Is it ? Like me to give it to her ? Would you ? I 'd be most obliged . Not at all . Don 't forget , it 's urgent . Oh , right away . Machine pumping ) ( Machine humming ) ﬂying door ) You make the most of your opportunities . You don 't blame us for doing the same . Ah , she 's taken to you . I 'm jealous . Oh , she 's mine . She works here , too . She 's very efficient ... Almost ruthless . Never trust a woman , even the four-legged variety . You can trust everyone ... And will , in time . Let 's go back . The cabaret 's beginning . In his pocket ... The wallet ? Yes . It 's still there , " amended " slightly . We 'll amend h ! Slightly . It 's you who 's died in an accident at sea . May I ? So to the outside world ... Which you only dream about ... I 'll be dead . A small confirmation of a known fact . Don 't blame me . It 's a question of waste not , want not . Number six : I thought there was a cabaret . There is ... you are it . In the matter of the people versus this person the court is now in session . What is my crime ? We 'll come to that . Perhaps I should explain our legal system is unusual . No jury ? Three judges decide here . As in the French revolution . They got through the dead wood , didn 't they ? I 'm appointed by the court to defend you ... This lady to prosecute . The judges have been chosen . ( Light music playing ) Number two : Proceed . You are charged with having on your person and using for unlawful purposes and against the interests of the community an object , the possession and use of which breaks our rules ... a radio set . Don 't you ask how I plead ? Judge : Proceed , prosecutor . From somewhere , he has not yet been subjected to interrogation . The accused acquired a radio . How do you know he had this radio ? I am his observer . She is biased and shouldn 't be here . I saw him with it in his room and later on top of the bell tower . Did anyone else see it ? The ... defender was with me on the bell tower . I saw him with it in his room . Thank you , your majesty . Proceed . He was listening to a program . Doctor : What manner of program ? I don 't know , it 's improper to listen . Quite right . Did you listen , madam ? How can my defender be a prosecution witness ? No , my lords , but it did work . It is the duty of all of us to care for each other and to see that the rules are obeyed . Without their discipline we should exist in a state of anarchy . Hear , hear . You do yourself no good , prisoner . He had no radio of his own . There 's no radio he could have borrowed . So in acquiring one he made a positive effort against the community indicating a malicious breaking of the rules . The court 's duty is to pass the severest possible sentence . Do you wish to question the prosecutor ? We shall hear the defender . I would beg the court to remember that beneath its panoply of splendor beneath the awful majesty of the rules beat human hearts . This is a human being with weaknesses and failings of his kind . That he had a radio and has broken rule after rule cannot be denied . Has anyone ever seen these " rules " ? I plead , your lordships , for clemency . He is new and guilty of folly , no more . We can treat folly with kindness knowing that soon his wild spirit will quieten and the foolishness will fall away to reveal a model citizen . That day you will never see . Judge : The prisoner will be silent . This is a serious matter . Very serious . Both officers have presented their pleas with creditable simplicity . We will now consider . ( Softly ) : What do you think ? I want to call a witness . Witness ? This lady and I are the only witnesses there can be . He has his rights . What manner of witness ? A character witness . I want the court to call roland Walter Dutton ! No names are used here . It 's a man I think I knew , a man who is scheduled to die and therefore , better fitted than I to say the things that need to be said . A character witness . The court will resume its deliberations . It is decided . We find the prisoner guilty of breach of the rules which his folly and inexperience cannot excuse . We pass sentence in accordance with the rules . No , stop it ! It 's the rules , my dear . The sentence is death . Doctor : We sentence in the name of the people . The people carry it out in the name of justice . Screaming y man : Over there ! ( Whirring ) ( Clicking ) Number two : It 's a one-way mirror . They can 't see you . They 've never seen in here , and they never will . They lack your initiative . Deal with them . Why are they trying to kill me ? They don 't know you 're already dead . Locked up in the long box in that little room . She 's no longer your observer . Observers of life should never get involved . You 'll never win . Then how very uncomfortable for you , old chap . ( Chuckling ) ( Clicking ) ( Number two continues chuckling )

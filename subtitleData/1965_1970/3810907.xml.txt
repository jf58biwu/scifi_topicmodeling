 Each person who tries to see beyond his own time , must face questions to which there cannot yet be proven answers . Hey , thanks a lot . Take it easy . Hey , ' bo . Hi . What are you doing , you ... boiling coffee ? Yeah . That 's good . That 's real good . You hoboing ? You know , kind of . I 'm trying to get to California . I 'm walking , hitchhiking , and I 'm getting there kind of slow . What 's in California ? My older sister and my brother-in-law in Fresno . Grapes ? I said , " Grapes ? " My brother-in-law works for Sears and Roebuck . He 's gonna get me in there . I need a job . Pretty good job , too . - Where do you come from ? - Horseheads , New York . - Yeah , I know where that is . - You 've been to Horseheads ? No , I ain 't never been to Horseheads , but I 've been to the Finger Lakes district , but that was ... a long , long time ago . Long ago . Listen , you 're going a long way to find a job , ain 't you ? Well , yeah , I ... Just wasn 't anything to keep me in Horseheads . Except maybe the Scouts . Well , my mother died July 24th . Peritonitis . - You were a Boy Scout ? - A scoutmaster . Troop 170 , Horseheads . What 's that ? Oh , that ain 't nothing . - My dog . - What ? I said , it 's my dog . He 's my buddy . He must be roasting in there . No , he 's not roasting . He likes it hot like I like it hot . I 'm sorry , I never saw a dog in a bag . - Well , maybe he has to go . - Maybe . Gee , he 's cute . Yeah , well , he 's 14 years old . - Oh , well , he sure doesn 't look it . - I know he don 't . - What 's his name ? - His name is Peke , like in Pekinese . But he 's a Pomeranian , isn 't he ? No , he ain 't . He 's a bum just like me . We 're two bums . How ... How long you been in this part of the state ? Oh , almost two weeks . I got a job on a dairy farm not too far from here . You know , to make a little extra cash . I 'm a real good milker . What 's your name ? - Willie . - Come here . Come here . Now sit down . Let me tell you something , when you 're on the road , see another bum , you meet anybody , you don 't tell him you got any money , because , boy , they 're liable to kill you to get it . Why , it wasn 't even $ 10 . That don 't make no difference ! You tell them nothing ! Yes , sir . Have you ever seen a house that looked like that ? Don 't look at the hand , look at the house . Oh , it looks like any ordinary little farmhouse to me . You see , this is a photograph that I cut out of Liberty magazine . Now , that 's not the exact house , but it sure does look like the one I 'm looking for . Yeah . I doubt I ever seen it . All right now , come on , you , sit up . Sit up for Carl . You little bastard . This house , you see , this house has a post in front of it . On that post there was a sign . And on that sign it says , " Skin Illustrations . " Skin Illustration . - Oh , well ... - Listen to me . You tell me , boy , and you tell me goddamn true . - Have you ever seen a sign that say that ? - No , sir , I never did . - Are you sure ? - I am sure . I 'd remember something like that if I did . I never saw anything like that . Honest . - You 're sure ? - Oh , yes , I 'm sure . I 'm positive , honest . Well , I 'm gonna find it . I 'm gonna find it . Well , there must be 100 houses like that around here . I 'm only looking for one . And I 'm looking for the lady that lives in it . And when I find her , I will kill her . Oh , yes . Oh , yes , I will kill her . I don 't know , you know , sometimes I know where that house is . Exactly . I mean , it comes into my ... Comes into my mind as clear as a bell . And then I start going there , and then I knew that I 'm getting close to it because I can feel it inside of me . I just know that I 'm getting close to it and then ... Just when I think that I 'm there , the damn thing goes right out of my head . Maybe she moved . Yeah . Oh , boy , she moved . She moved and she took the whole blessed house with her . She moved all right . That was a long time ago . Long time ago , that was ... It was on Labor Day . Tomorrow 's Labor Day . Same as any other day to me . Well , not to me , it ain 't . - That 's a garter snake . - Yeah , well , I 'm gonna kill it . Well , it 's a garter snake . Out of the way , I said it 's a snake . I 'll kill it . - They 're good . They 're not gonna hurt you . - They 're not good ! Come on . Die . Die ! Die ! Die ! Get it away from him . No , no . Let him eat it . Do him some good . Maybe he 'll sit up straighter . They 're good to have around . They weren 't gonna hurt anybody . Wouldn 't have hurt you . They 're no good for nothing in any goddamn place in the world ! It 's a snake , ain 't it ? And I tell you what I could use right now , boy . I could use some good , cheap bourbon whiskey . - You got any of that ? - No . I love that . Peke don 't like it , but I love it . Why would you wanna kill anybody ? You wanna know why ? All right . I 'll show you why . Oh , my God . Well , go on , take a look ! Wow . Pretty , ain 't they ? I never saw anything like that . Well , that ... That 's the most fantastic thing I ever saw . Is that what you meant by skin illustrations ? Tattoos ? They 're not tattoos . They 're skin illustrations . Don 't you ever call them tattoos . Let me tell you , don 't you look at those illustrations too long , because they 'll come alive and they 'll tell you stories . You remember that lady that I was talking to you about ? Remember her ? Well , I tell you what she did for me , she created for me my own private hell . You see that blank space on my back there ? See it ? And now the people look into that and they see the future . Well , that 's all well and good . But if you want to see your future , you may have to pay a price because you may look in there , see how you 're gonna die . You may look in there and see what you 're gonna look like when you 're old and rotten and shriveled and mean and through . Well , people don 't like to see that , do they ? No , they don 't ! So after a while , they don 't like me and then after a while , they grow to hate me ! But didn 't you have any doubts about getting tattooed all over like that ? I wasn 't thinking about getting tattooed . I was thinking about getting laid . And I told you once before , and this is the last time I am gonna tell you , please , don 't ever call them tattoos . I 'm sure I never saw a house like that with a sign like that anywhere around here . Well , maybe she went back into the future someplace . " Back " into the future ? That 's what I said , back into the future . Maybe 1,000 years . I was working this two-bit carnival . I was putting up tents . Anyway , it was a hot day and there was this lion , he was screaming and there was this elephant , he was answering back . And I don 't know , I was horny that day , I just had to get out of there , so I took myself a little walk . I walked along and I came to this place . This house . And there was a post in front of it . On that post was a sign , and on that sign it said , " Skin Illustrations . " " Skin Illustrations . " Hello . Hello . Well , it 's ... It 's kind of hot , ain 't it ? Very . Well , does it always get this hot around Labor Day ? Sometimes . Can I offer you something cold to drink ? Well , water 'd be fine . I have some lemonade all ready . Come on in . All right . Come on . Come on . Nothing satisfies like lemonade when it 's real hot like this . Well , I guess you could say that . What a magnificently strong hand . Well , I don 't know , I guess it got that strong swinging the big hammer at the carnival . Carnival life must be very exciting . I also handle the elephant shovel , and I don 't think you could call that exciting . Come and sit down . - Over there ? - Next to me . Anyway , that 's what I do . I put tents up and then I take tents down and , well , that 's about it . Anyway ... you know , sometimes when they have a heavy day , you see , they let me ... Hand . When they have a heavy day , they let me collect tickets . And then , of course , some days when it ain 't too heavy , they don 't let me do nothing . Right there . In the very center . I know just what belongs there . That 's when I learned what her name was . " There 's a rose , " she said , " a rose you 'll always carry in your hand . " A rose from Felicia . " Well , I think the rose is just beautiful . I haven 't seen anything like that even in the circus . Circus ? Let me tell you something , son . There ain 't a circus or a carnival in this country touch us with a ten foot pole , you know . I told you before , these things come alive , and when they come alive , they scare people . Nobody 's gonna hang around and look at them . And I know they come alive , 'cause , you see , I can feel them squirming , moving on my back . I can 't hear what they 're saying , but , boy , I can feel them moving . Peke , he don 't , well , he don 't hear nothing anyway . With his garter snakes and his little bugs anyway . But , boy , I know they 're there . I still think the rose is beautiful . So did I. So did I. She knew everything and she had been everywhere . There 's a rose you 'll always carry in your hand . A rose from Felicia . Come . Come on . Come and see it outside . The colors are so much more alive . Come on , come over here . Come here . Tell me you love it . I love it . What 's your name ? My name is Carl . Carl . Tell me what you smell right now . Right this very minute . What I smell ? Well , I 'll ... I smell dust and I smell ... dry weeds . Yeah , something else . Yeah , but I 'm , I don 't know unless you can say ... - Something else . - Well , I do . I kind of smell the heat . Yeah , that 's right . Now try to imagine all those smells somewhere else , not here , somewhere else . Well , I don 't know . Where ... I could say where the lions live , down in Africa . That 's right . Where the lions live , down in Africa . Right there , Carl . Right there . Right there , well ... I was the one that said it . Idiot me . Oh , yeah , right there , where the lions live , down in Africa . She had lived in the past , and she had lived in the future and she put it all on me . They 're filthy things . The lions ? No , not the lions , the stinking vultures in the tree . I wanted you to see just what I 've been seeing every day for weeks . Well , I 've seen it . Come on , let 's go . What do you suppose they 're feeding on ? I don 't know . Maybe zebra , giraffe . Something like that . Come on . Come on . Carl , did you hear a scream ? No . You didn 't hear anything ? No , I didn 't hear anything . I don 't want our children to play here anymore , Carl . Please turn it off . It 's been the same African veldt for weeks now . Ever since you and Johnny had that argument . All right , all right . I know that , I know that . It was your idea to install the playroom in the first place , so our children could work off the ... What was it you called it ? Natural hostilities ? I 'm sorry we ever bought the damn thing ! So am I. So am I. But you 're the one that sold me on the free involvement theory , instantaneous atmosphere . If a child wants anything , wishes it hard enough , all he has to do is flip a switch and there you are . Well , electronic image or not , I don 't like it . - We 've got to get rid of it , Carl . - We 'll have to talk to the children first . The children can go in there and think of anything . The past , the future . They can think of anything . It could become destructive . Apparently , the Minister of Mental Health doesn 't share your protective attitude . Well , to hell with him . I don 't want to experiment with my own children . All right , then for the time being , we 'll consider the playroom out of bounds . All right ? Now what we need is a good , stiff drink . Maybe it 's just me . Just my imagination . No , it 's not you , it 's not your imagination . It 's the world we live in . Everything is done for us . You throw a glass into the glass incinerator and out comes a freshly molded glass . What 's left for us to do ? What , the body functions ? Sleep , sex ? What 's left ? I don 't know . I don 't know , maybe it 's the stupid labor laws . Can 't work more than six months a year . So you mustn 't upset the great planned global balance of economy . Well , that 's great for business , isn 't it ? What about the other six months of the year ? I don 't know . Carl , make love to me . Why ? Well , why ? Maybe this time it 'll be different . - Who is it ? - It 's Will McLean . Caught you both with a drink in your hand . Don 't tell me the sun 's already over the yardarm out there in Baltimore . - Hello , Will . - How 's it going ? Oh , putting in my time . Talking to a lot of sick people . Hey , listen , I got a breakfast meeting in Havana tomorrow morning . I thought I might stop off on my way back . - Well , we 'll be here . - Can you make it for lunch ? - I 'd love to . How are the kids ? - Great . Will , Carl doesn 't share my concern , but when you come , I 'd like to talk to you about a possible problem . - Johnny ? - Yeah , Johnny , I think . Maybe both . Listen , how long have you been our Mental Health Counselor ? Anna was three . Well , then you know how sometimes her mother , she gets over-excited about something that may not exist . It 's that nursery , Will . It scares me . What do you mean , " Uh-oh " ? Well , what do you mean , " Uh-oh " ? Well , we 've been having our share of problems in that area of The Free Involvement Program . Hey , look , I 'll talk about it with you tomorrow . Okay ? Okay . - See you about 1 : 00 ? - Around then . ' Licia . - Be well . - Bye . Carl , Felicia , we 're home ! The Science Carnival was great ! That 's too far to go alone . Too far ? Don 't argue with your father . Get ready for dinner . We 're not hungry . We ate all kinds of stuff at the Carnival . We just loved Bermuda . We 're going back again tomorrow . You 're not going anywhere , unless I give you permission . That goes for you , too , young lady . Now you go with your mother and get ready for dinner . Come on . All I know is that , when I was your age , I wasn 't allowed to attach my space capsule to any navigational beam over 100 miles in distance . I mean , not until I was over 16 years of age , anyway . Suppose you had to go 150 miles ? You just didn 't go . Well , what could they do to you if you did ? What do you mean ? If you got caught ? Yeah . Oh , they 'd revoke your space license . Did you think that was fair then ? Since you 're asking so many questions , let me ask you a question about that fancy nursery of yours . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'm talking about Africa and I 'm talking about the lions , that 's what I 'm talking about . There 's no Africa in the nursery . There isn 't , no ? Well , I think it 's only fair to tell you that your mother and I spent a little time in there today . I don 't remember any Africa . Do you , Anna ? Go see , Anna . See what we left on . She doesn 't have to go see . We 've both seen it already . - You 're mistaken . - I 'm mistaken ? All right , we 're gonna find out who 's mistaken . You come with me , young man . Come on . Let 's go , and let 's go quick . I 've had enough of this now . Let 's go , Felicia . We 'll find out pretty quick who 's mistaken . All right . Whose idea was this ? Anna and I play all the time here . - Every day ? - Not every day . - Almost every day . - Almost every day . I see . Well , of course , you ... do play in the African veldt from time to time though , don 't you ? I think we did once . A long time ago . Do you remember how long ago , young lady ? A long time ago . - Months and months ago . - I see , I see . All right , I wanna tell you something now . Your mother and I know that you 're lying , you understand that ? - Oh , Carl , leave it alone . - I don 't care . We don 't ... Leave it alone . All right , go on . Go get cleaned up . - We 're not that dirty . - Go get cleaned up . Sound waves can 't hurt you . Go on , do as your father says . Go on . Well , obviously our children are trying to make fools out of us . Well , Carl , Will will be here tomorrow . He 'll ... He 'll know what to do . He 's trained to deal with these problems . Look , I tell you what . Let them play in here tomorrow if they want to , but don 't say anything about Will coming to lunch . All right ? - All right . - And don 't worry . We 'll straighten it out . It 's been like that for weeks now , just the way we found it . What are they eating ? I don 't know . - Vultures here all the time ? - All the time . Doesn 't feel good , Carl . What do you mean it doesn 't feel good ? Well , all children get the feeling that their parents are persecuting them , but this goes beyond that . In what way ? Well , Johnny and Anna aren 't releasing destructive thoughts here anymore . They 're embracing them . Embracing them ? There 's a point at which fantasy becomes dangerously close to reality . Carl , rip it down , get rid of it . I was wrong to recommend it in the first place . I realize that . Just get rid of it . That 's Felicia 's scarf . That 's my slipper . - The room will hate you if you kill it ! - Now , you stop talking like that , Johnny . - It has feelings , too . You can 't kill it ! - Listen , I 'm not killing anything . It 's not a human being . It 's a machine . A machine you can have if you 've got the money to buy it . That 's all it is . So , now , you stop it ! Johnny , tomorrow Dr. Will is coming to take us to therapy refuge for a vacation . - Doesn 't that please you ? - No , it doesn 't . I like it here . I 'm not going to any creepy place where I have to do everything myself . Now , you listen to me and you listen to me good , young man . You talk to your mother one more time in that tone of voice and I 'll give you a slap across the face that you 'll never forget . - You 'd better not . - Don 't you talk to me like that ! - Carl , leave him alone . - I don 't care . I 'm not gonna have any son of mine talk to me like that in my house . Now , go to bed ! Go on , get going . Oh , I don 't know , I don 't know . You don 't know what ? What do you want me to do ? What are you looking at ? You 're as guilty as he is . You 're both in this thing together and I know it . Go on , get out of here . Go on . When I say go , go . Leave her alone , Carl . She 's not causing any trouble . What do you mean she 's not causing any trouble ? This house is loaded with trouble . The nursery , that 's trouble , isn 't it ? Go on , go to bed when I tell you . Johnny 's right ! I 'm certainly glad to get away for a while , I tell you . The thing I love about Will , he 's so understanding . I guess he is . I guess he is . Listen . Yesterday , before Will called , we were about to come up here and make love . Do you remember ? Were we ? Can I ask you a question ? Yeah . How do you feel now ? No . Carl , Felicia , come quickly . Hurry ! Mommy , Daddy , quick , quick ! Mommy , Daddy . - Carl ! Felicia ! Come quick ! - Carl ! Felicia ! Hurry ! Quick ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Daddy ! Come quick ! Hurry ! Daddy ! Mommy ! Carl ! Felicia ! Quickly ! Hurry ! Morning . Everybody ready ? Carl ? 'Licia ! Where is everybody ? Johnny ? Carl ? Johnny ? Anna ? Where are your parents ? May I offer you a cup of coffee ? Doctor ? Oh , my God . You want a cup of coffee ? - Hey . - Huh ? May I offer you a cup of coffee ? Oh , yes , thank you . I know what you 're thinking . The funny thing is that women usually ask that question before men do . Well , the answer is yes . I 'm covered with pictures from the neck right down to the toes . Everywhere , and I mean everywhere . Yes , sir . Everywhere . I remember that lady . Boy , she had lilacs around her house and in the heat it used to stink to high heaven , and I mean to the high heaven . Man , they smelled so sweet , they made you dizzy . - Did I tell you about the lilacs ? - No , I don 't think so . - I didn 't tell you about it ? - No , I don 't think so . They made you puke . - Yeah , you told me about the lilacs . - I thought I did , yeah . Yeah . I remember her . I remember it was about this time of evening and I was sitting there and all of a sudden it hit me . It hit me that I had had enough . I had just had enough . I mean , I was ... Man , I was there with the wherewithal , I was ready , willing and able . I was more than able . And then it dawned on me that nothing was gonna happen , ever . And there I was . Boy , I was sitting there like a big idiot , with half my body covered in skin illustrations . Skin illustrations . And all the time , she knew what she was doing . Well , no more , thank you . Why don 't you sit down and rest for a bit ? No , thank you . That last one hurt . No , thank you . I 'm gonna go back and I 'm gonna ... Rig the midway and get ready for the night time rubes . When you coming back ? What ? When you coming back ? I don 't know . Maybe sometime tomorrow . - You 're lying . - I am not . Don 't you ever call me a liar . I never lie . I never lie . When I 've finished with you , think of the money you can make . You 'll be more beautiful than anyone on this entire planet , I promise you . - I 'd be a freak . - You 'd be beautiful . I would not be beautiful . I would be a freak . No , Carl . You 'll be something special . You 'll be beautiful . You 'll matter . Jesus Christ in heaven , these damn things don 't come off . I 'm half a freak now . Carl ... - Let me finish . - You 're not gonna finish nothing . Did you let me touch you for one second ? You did not . What do you think I am , some kind of stupid animal or something ? You 're a man , Carl . A man . Never flinch from pain . Pain is part of everything good . Lie down . I 'll make you happier than you 've ever been in your whole life . You know what I 'm gonna put there ? What ? A rocket . I 'm gonna look like the Fourth of July . That 's what I said . I 'll look like the Fourth of July . What was the reason you didn 't leave when you started to ? Well , why haven 't you left ? - Don 't you get personal . - I 'm sorry . Now , shut up now ! Come on now ! Shut up ! All you do is make noise in the world . That 's how you handle little things , see ? You just yell at them and they shut up like a clam . And that puts them in their proper place . Man , I don 't like little things . I don 't like bugs and frogs and spiders and creepy , crawly things that zing out at you and bite you when you 're not looking . You know what a tick looks like ? Well , sure . I 've seen ticks . Yeah , well , they 're the worst because they find you no matter where you are . And they creep up on you and they suck your blood , see ? Oh , they stink . They is rotten things . - Yeah , I don 't like ticks either . - Yeah , neither do I. Let me give you a word of advice . Don 't get too personal with me . Okay . I didn 't mean anything by it . Yeah , that 's enough now . I don 't wanna talk about it no more . Understood ? All right , come on , Peke , come on . It 's time to go to bed . That 's a good dog . Just say your prayers and you get a good night 's sleep . She 's ... She 's very beautiful , isn 't she ? You 've seen her , haven 't you ? Haven 't you ? Well ? Haven 't you ? Yes . Well , now you know . I 'll tell you one thing . And I told her , " Lady , you put anything on me , " and I want it to be big , " and I want it to have power , " and I want it to have energy , " like a ... A rocket . " How long have we been here ? Six days . Can 't be six days . It 's more than six days . Just six days . Can 't be six days . It 's more than six days . We 've been here longer than six days . Can 't be six days . It 's more than six days . We 've been here longer than six days . Well , shut up ! I 'm in command here , and don 't you forget that . That goes for the rest of you , too . Anybody who tries to think on his own is going to get shot down like a deserter . Is that understood ? I 've been in this situation before and I 've survived it . Why ? What did you say ? I said , Colonel , why do you think you have survived any more than we have ? Yeah , that 's good , Williams . Answer him that one , Colonel . Because I 'm stronger than you are , that 's why . And what about you , Simmons , huh ? Wanna see how strong I am , how tough I am ? You wanna push your luck in with these two and see how far you can push me ? I just wanna get to a Sun Dome , that 's all . He doesn 't know where there 's one , Sim . What the hell are we following him for ? Colonel , you don 't know where we are any more than we do . Why the hell are we following you ? Will you listen to me ? Four of us got out of that wreckage alive . Alive ! That means something . That 's the big difference . That means we got a chance to survive . Now , there 's 120 Sun Domes scattered over 1 1 continents on this stinking planet , and if we find one , one Sun Dome , we 've made it . We came through , we survived . They can get a ship up here and pull us off within a month . You got a better idea , Simmons ? Pickard ? You , Williams , you 're so bloody smart , so sarcastic . Show me the way to a Sun Dome . Everything 's a guess , isn 't it ? Well , I only know one thing . Keep moving and you keep alive . That 's all I know . And we 're gonna move . We 're gonna follow this stream and we 're gonna pray that it takes us to the shore of the Single Sea . There 's one Sun Dome every 20 miles . If we get there , we 've made it and we are alive . So , on your feet and let 's go . We 'll follow the stream and pray it gets us there . The rain hurts my head . You put your head in there , it 's like a kettle drum . In three hours you 're stone deaf . Well , a deaf man is a cripple , and I 'm not having a cripple on my back . Get up , get on your feet , and you follow me . Come on , move out . There 's not enough space between this rain to breathe . My lungs feel like they 're going to split open . All right , listen to me , listen to me . Bend your head forward . Bend your head forward , and try to get the water out of your mouth and breathe deep , come on . Take a deep breath . I don 't think you 're getting us anywhere . All right . Shut up . Keep your mouth shut , save your energy . Keep talking , that 's a convenient way to commit suicide . You 'd like that . You 've been waiting for that , haven 't you ? I said no talking . That goes for you , too , now . Yes , sir , Colonel . Don 't talk . - My head . - I said , don 't talk . Come on , come on , come on , no more of this standing here . It 's our ship . Well , Colonel , here we are , right back where we started from seven days ago . I could get in there for the map case , Colonel . You go near the ship , you 'll get contaminated . Forget it . Without those survival maps , we 're never gonna find anything . You don 't think he 's gonna admit that , do you , Sim ? He won 't even admit he 's been leading us around in circles . - Hey , Williams . - What ? - Let 's kill him . - What for ? Our lives mean nothing to him . If Sim had listened to him , he 'd still be here . You know , I hate him , Williams . - Yeah , well . - God , I really hate him . Come here . Now , what 's that ? What is it ? - A Sun Dome . - That 's right . My guess ! My guess ! - This is it , isn 't it ? - This is what ? Just means there should be another Sun Dome about 20 miles from here . How do we know it 's not destroyed like this one , Colonel ? I don 't know . We just hope , that 's all . Pickard ! Pickard ! He 's trying to drown himself . - Let me go . - It 's too late for him . Even this little bit of shelter is better than none . It doesn 't pound you all the time . It pounds you , the rain . I tell you something , Williams . I 'm glad that you made it this far with me . Not because it 's you , but because somebody 's with me . Colonel , I 've got a surprise for you . I 'm deaf . Why don 't you issue me one of your famous survival orders , so I can tell you what to do with it , huh ? I can 't hear you . Can 't hear you , Colonel . Gone . Well , damn you , look at my mouth . Read my lips . I read your lips , Colonel . But I can 't understand what you 're saying . I don 't understand you at all . Williams , I figure we 've only got about 10 more miles to go . If we get there ... Look at me . If we get there , it will be dry , it will be warm . There will be the sun . And women . Women ? There are old , sexy women just around the corner . Is that what you 're trying to tell me , Colonel ? Now , tell me , are they whores ? Space whores ? That 's supposed to suck me in , huh , Colonel ? Does the Space Manual say , " At last resort , promise your men anything , " including a gorgeous whore , " huh ? What if , Colonel , what if a certain kind of man doesn 't want a whore ? If , in fact , the thought repulses him . What then ? Then I 'd say ... I 'd say he was a liar . I 'm not a liar . Do me one last favor , will you , Colonel ? Go find yourself a nice , private , quiet , lovely Sun Dome whorehouse . You 're not a man , Williams . You 're a shit ! And what are you , Colonel ? What are you ? Destroy , right ? Destroy and command . Anything . Anything . Anything that gets in your way . Anything that 's more refined , more sensitive , anything that loves . Destroy and command and take over . And stamp out anything . Colonel . Oh , Colonel , you 're a rotten breed . Low , basic , rotten breed . You destroy . You 'd destroy the world , wouldn 't you ? To survive . Get on your feet . And that 's an order ! Get out of here . Go on , get out of here . This is my time . I know it . And I 'm glad I know it . You wanna know something funny ? I won 't even hear the laser pop . But you will . Welcome , Colonel . Where are you going ? None of your damn business where I 'm going . You want to hear what happened later on in the night ? No . She almost treated me like I were her husband . Please . I have to go . She really got to love them illustrations . She 'd look at them , then she 'd begin to study them . And then she 'd laugh . After a while , she 'd begin to touch them all over . And then , she 'd begin to kiss them . And that made her real happy . I wanna go . Go . What makes you think you can keep me here ? What makes you think you can go ? Be quiet , you little fool . Nobody 's talking to you . Go back to sleep . She couldn 't have wanted you . You 're never gonna find her . Never . You 're never gonna find her . Never . I love you so . So glad you 're back . Tell me what happened . There was a final World Forum . It is as we dreamed , isn 't it ? Yes . All the male population of the world attended . It was 2193 . And they all agreed . They had the same vision , without exception . Tonight is the last night of the world ? Tonight 's the last night of the world . Tonight 's the last night of the world . Tonight 's the last night of the world . Tonight 's the last night of the world . How , Carl ? No one knows how . But all dreamed of an ending . As it was in 4187 , when the gas cloud covered the earth and the only people that survived were on the highest mountains . This time no one will survive ? No one . That was the unanimous conclusion of the Forum . How are the children ? Beautiful , as always . What did the World Forum rule ? Peoples of the Earth are reconciled that this is the last night of the world . And only the children are not to know . What do we do ? They 're to be spared . Tell them nothing , then ? The ruling was that they were spared the dream so they should be spared the experience . How can they be spared ? They 're to be put to sleep . Put to sleep ? Put to sleep ? They 're to be given these at bedtime . Kill the children ? Oh , that 's impossible . I don 't believe it . The world 's agreed . Oh , no , never . Never . Our children are everything . They 're the future . There will be no future . They 're all agreed . They had the same dream . Nothingness . No one on Earth had a different dream ? No one . I will not kill my children . We 're subject to the ruling . I don 't care about the ruling . Felicia , all those at the Forum love their children as we love ours . But none want to see them suffer . We don 't know how the end will be . Will it be sudden ? Will it be lingering ? Will they be burned to death ? Mommy ! Father ! Father 's back ! Oh , Father , we missed you so much . Is anything wrong ? No , no , no . No , nothing 's wrong . It 's just that ... your mother was so pleased to see your father home , she started to cry . Sometimes people do that when they 're happy , you see . Now , which one of you rode the animals most today ? - He did . - No , she did . Wait , wait , wait now . That 's no way to welcome your father home with an argument . I tell you what . You ... You go outside and play some more . All right ? Go on . You 're their father , Carl . Could you kill them ? It didn 't happen . Carl . It didn 't happen . You bastard . You killed them . You killed your own children . Shut up . What the hell ? Didn 't I ... Well , what the hell are you doing there ? Boy , I tell you , these days ... Get over there and get in there . You give me any more trouble tonight and I 'll throw you in the lake . Don 't you come out either , or I 'll crown you . You 're evil . You killed them , didn 't you ? You killed them . You killed Pickard . You killed Simmons . You kill people . You crummy bastard . What the hell are you talking about , huh ? I never killed anybody . The one person I 'm gonna kill , that 's the lady , if I find her . Boy , if I find her , I 'm gonna step on her like a cockroach and throw her away like a dog throws away a dead snake . No , you won 't ! What are you going to do , little boy ? Go ahead . Go ahead . Get down there . Get down there . Come here . All right now , watch it ! You made love to her , didn 't you ? Didn 't you make love to her ? Why don 't you just shut up before I split your skull . Shut up ! Now , you listen to me and understand . You 're the one who was curious . You 're the one who wanted to see the future . So now , you just take it easy , sonny boy . And you just relax . And just relax now . Relax , sonny boy . It 's almost daybreak . Why don 't you lie on my bed and relax ? I won 't be long . Carl ! Carl ! Carl ! Felicia ? Did you call me ? Carl . Carl . Felicia ! Felicia ! Yeah , you 're trying to tell me she didn 't come back to the house , huh ? She took the house with her . What do you mean she took the house with her ? I mean that she took everything except the kitchen chair . She took everything and left one chair ? Is that what you 're trying to tell me ? She took everything but the kitchen chair . On it was my clothes and my shoes . And there it was , standing all alone in the middle of the field . Where 'd she go ? She went back into the future , beyond our own time . People don 't disappear . Houses don 't disappear . Nothing disappears . Well , then you show me the house . You find me the lady . You 're a liar . You . If I 'm a liar , where did these come from ? You 've been looking at them , haven 't you ? You watched them come alive , didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? - Didn 't you ? - Yeah . Well , who put them there ? 'Cause I didn 't . You think that over , Willie . Oh , my God . Each person who tries to see beyond his own time must face questions to which there cannot yet be absolute answers . English

 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . This then , Your Majesty , is the great Magna Carta ... limiting the powers of the king ... and establishing the rights of man . It needs only your signature ... to make it the law of the land . You - the Earl of Huntington - you call yourself a loyal subject ? This is treason . Treason ! I 'll hang you and all the barons who follow your flag . Seize the traitor . Seize him ! Do not let him escape . Surrender . [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . Surrender now ! Bring them before the king . Who is this man ? Obviously a servant of Huntington . Your Majesty , even traitors can serve a purpose . Spare them if they tell us what we must know . No one will say King John is without mercy . Huntington ... I will spare your life and the life of your servant here - Your Majesty , I 'm not this man 's servant . As for this - I will not discuss these treasonable demands with you ... or your fellow barons . Not treasonable , but a respectful request from the Council of Barons . All we want is a charter guaranteeing the rights ... - of all our free men . - Just a charter . A great charter - or as you call it , a Magna Carta - stripping your king of all his powers . If I don 't return to the Council of Barons ... within 48 hours , they will call their armies ... - into the field . - Rebellion ? Yes , Your Majesty . You 'll hang ... and I 'll put the heads of all the others on public display . Take them to the dungeon . And if they don 't tell you where the barons are meeting ... make them beg for death . [ Footsteps ] Chain them to the walls . Go tell the captain of the guards to search the castle . More of Huntington 's men may have got in . I 'm sorry you became involved in my quarrel with the king ... but we 'll die for a good cause . Just who are you ? That doesn 't matter . But as for the Magna Carta , King John will sign it . - I 'm sure of it . - It 's a pity we 'll never live to see it . Hot enough to sear the flesh ? Heat the other iron . Where is the Council of Barons meeting ? Who 's going to talk first ? The servant ? Or the master ? He knows nothing . Begin with me . No ! - I 'll tell you where the barons are meeting . - Don 't be a fool ! If you do know , keep quiet . They 'll kill us immediately . Perhaps your servant prefers mercy . Well ? Tell me , but if you lie - [ Grunts ] [ Pounding ] There 'll be a hundred soldiers out there in less than a minute ... and we 'll be dead in less than five . Now . Try for a transfer . If only that door holds for another second or two , we 'll have enough power , but - The fix isn 't firm . All we have is the year and the month - June , 1 21 5 A.D. Ray - the homing post . If we could get it to Doug and Tony ... we could bring them right back into the Tunnel . But Ann , we 've tried that before . Well , yes , sir , but never in this time period . And we 've improved its capabilities . All right . All right , let 's try it . - [ Pounding Continues ] - If we can get one of these bars out ... we might be able to squeeze through . It would take more than the strength of the three of us . This is malleable iron , not hardened steel . We 've got a chance , Tony . Here . What are you doing ? These coals will soften that metal . It 'll never work ! Get ready to fight . - That 's it . - It 's working . Keep going . It 's out . Come on . Go on , Tony . You first . Hurry ! [ Huntington ] We 'll be safe in the forest . Go ahead . I 'll take care of him . Go ! They caught him before he could get away . You know , Tony , if it wasn 't for him ... we would have had it by now . - Who is he ? - Someone called the Earl of Huntington . The Tunnel transferred us into King John 's time . King John ? He 's the one who was forced to sign the Magna Carta . Right , although I 'm afraid a lot of blood 's ... gonna be spilled before he signs it . Now , Huntington 's the leader of the barons ... who wantJohn to grant the charter . Doug , we wouldn 't stand a chance if we tried to get back into the castle to help him . If only we could find the other barons . You know , according to history ... John met the barons at Runnymede . I wonder if that 's where they could be gathered now . We could try to find them . At least we could warn them about what happened to Huntington . Come on . Reading : 1 1 4.36 over 1 1 . 1 1 4.36 over 1 1 . General , we 're set . All Doug and Tony have to do is touch that post ... in order for us to retrieve them . All right . Activate . It should reach its target . How soon can we get an image ? As soon as we rebuild power . Get the window bars repaired . - Get the guards mounted and make haste after them . - Aye ! [ Whistle ] - I heard something . - Just a bird . Aye-A bird . A large green bird ... ready to catch a couple of worms . [ Whistles ] - Out of the frying pan . - What was that ? - Speak up , man . - We 're strangers . We 're just passing through . [ Chuckles ] Aye . Well , you must be a couple of Frenchmen . Why , no Englishman would be buried in such clothes . [ Laughing ] [ Chuckling ] Little worm . If you defeat me , you 'll go free - aye - but if you lose , we 're gonna skin you both alive . Eh ! [ Chuckling ] [ Shouts ] Hah ! - [ Groans ] - [ Laughing ] You 're just a greenhorn . Oh ! [ Laughs ] Right . Will you yield , or shall I squash you ? Huh ? Ah , you did well , and it took some doing to beat you . Aye , LittleJohn . I think he 'd make a welcome addition ... - to Robin Hood 's band . - Robin Hood ? Yes , we 're his followers . I 'm Friar Tuck . You 're already met LittleJohn . You know , I always thought that Robin Hood was a legend . Well , a living legend . Why , everyone in England tells of the deeds ... of the Earl of Huntington when he was an outlaw . Huntington 's being held prisoner in King John 's castle . Prisoner ? Why , he went to them in peace . Oh , we 'll storm the castle and carveJohn 's heart out . With a handful of men , we wouldn 't stand a chance . Let 's get back to our camp and put our heads together . Are you with us ? I guess we owe it to him . - We 're with you . - Hmm . Not in those clothes . We 'll get some proper green for you both . I 'll ride out to the castle and tell the guard at the gate ... of an important message from the king . Now then . The minute the gate opens ... - we 'll all charge out of the forest . - No . No , no , no , no . The archers on the walls would cut us down ... before we 'd reach the courtyard . No . We 've got to steal into the castle somehow - two or three of us - then we 'll seize King John ... and hold him as a hostage to free Robin . - Too bold a plan . - That 's exactly why it may work . [ Horses Whinnying ] - What 's that ? - Scatter ! Come on . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Groans ] No . No . - He 's badly hurt . - Get on without me . Lean on me . Come on . Doug . A staff , quick . ! Quick , after them . You two that way . You with me . [ Laughing ] Well done , lads . - Now for this . - No ! No , it 'll only cause more bleeding . Where can we go ? He needs attention badly . Kirkley Hall . He can be treated there . It 's a retreat in the forest , run by the Baroness Elmont . She used to give us refuge in our outlaw days . Come on , old friend . Lean on me . Come on . Come on . [ Muttering ] What made Huntington think I would agree ... to even one clause of his precious Magna Carta ? Your Majesty . We trapped a group of Huntington 's followers . - Did you slaughter them ? - No , Your Majesty ... but every road and pass out of the forest is guarded . One of them is badly wounded . They won 't escape , Your Majesty . If they do , Engelard , it 'll be your head . - But your Majesty , I 'll do everything I - - Oh , stop mumbling . Go make Huntington talk . He says these men won 't escape ... but as long as any of Huntington 's band remains alive ... our plan to crush these barons is in danger . Engelard said one of them was badly wounded . I know these former outlaws . They 're sentimental fools . Rather than desert a wounded comrade ... they 'll jeopardize their own safety to help him . Your Majesty , a purse of gold can succeed ... where Engelard 's soldiers have failed . Bribery is the best weapon . [ Coins Jingle ] Use it . Shall I bleed you a little more ? - Engelard - - Speak up . When are you going to tell me where the barons are meeting ? When the Magna Carta is signed ... you will be among the first to be tried by its terms . [ Chuckles ] For serving my king ? Our laws will make each man responsible for his own actions . You won 't live to see that day . Tony and Doug must have gotten out somehow . Where 's the homing post ? Try to locate Tony and Doug . It may be possible to transfer the homing post to their new location . [ Knocking ] - Friar Tuck . - Baroness , sanctuary . LittleJohn 's been wounded . - Will you give us shelter ? - Of course . There 's nothing I wouldn 't do for the followers of the Earl of Huntington . Put him there . - How did it happen ? - We had a fight with the king 's men . I assumed as much . But Huntington has sworn allegiance to King John . Well , that 's all changed . He 's being held a prisoner at King John 's castle . I must send a messenger to the village - to fetch someone with skill to cure it . I 'm sorry . No one else must know we 're here . But LittleJohn might die . I must send someone - someone who can help him . I can take care of him . - Sterilize this . - St - Sterilize ? Yes . Put the blade in the fire and heat it ... until it 's red hot . Do you have any medicines that might relieve the fever ? I have some herbs . But I still think - - Will you show me where they are , please ? - All right . The best thing for a fever is bleeding with leeches . No . He 's lost too much blood already . Sulfur . Some sort of phosphorus . This root powder is used to relieve pain . - Tastes like snake root . - Is there anything there you can use ? Well , this is an alkaloid tranquilizer - Reserpine . Will you mix this with water , please ? You know , some of these so-called remedies ... if mixed in the right proportions ... could be highly explosive . I want you to drink this . It 'll help your pain . [ Groans ] That 's enough . Will you just get this bastard arrow out of me , man ? I 'm sick enough as it is , without drinking that poison . - Ready ? - Aye . The knife . [ Sharp Groan ] Tell me . What is the trouble between Huntington and the king ? It has to do with the Great Charter . If King John knew better , he 'd sign it without a fight . He 's going to have to anyway . Huntington gave the king an ultimatum . Either he signs a charter guaranteeing that he rules ... according to laws fair to everyone ... or he 's faced with rebellion . Where did you learn the art of curing , Douglas ? Just battlefield first aid , Tuck . I think LittleJohn will be all right now . - What of Robin Hood ? - We 've got to find a way to rescue him . Inform the barons of what has happened . I 'll send my messenger to them . Where are they meeting ? - Oh , the Council is - - No , Tuck . What you said before still goes . If the barons decide to march on the castle , Robin Hood 's as good as dead . I should have a voice in this matter too . If I am placing Kirkley Hall in jeopardy ... the least you can do is consider my opinion . - We are extremely grateful . - Save your thank-yous . If you wish to risk your lives entering the castle , all right . But suppose you fail . Let me send my messenger to the barons . Where did you say they 're meeting ? Well , there 's risk either way . More risk to Robin Hood if they decide to march against King John . Yeah . The only thing that 's keeping Robin alive ... is thatJohn doesn 't know the council is meeting at Runnymede . There will be no messages to the barons . As you wish . The answer is to use stealth . There is a way to enter the castle ... with no risk whatsoever . I myself shall see you safely in . We three will go . You will remain with LittleJohn . - We 've got them . - [ Ray ] They 're together . A perfect fix . Ann , lock the coordinates ... and switch the image to the homing post . Good . Prepare to transfer the post . The coordinates are aligned . The post hasn 't moved . Try more power . - We lost the image . - Worse yet , we 've lost the fix on Doug and Tony . Ah , my dear Baroness . The guards informed me you asked for shelter . - Welcome , in the name of the king . - Thank you . Who are these men ? These humble monks are going with me to London on official business . Will you provide quarters for them ? And while I 'm here ... I 'd like to report on conditions at Kirkley Hall . Certainly . Report to the chamberlain in the tower . He 'll see that you 're made comfortable . - Have you any news ? - Yes . LittleJohn and another outlaw are at Kirkley Hall . Ah ! Send some men to Kirkley Hall . You 'll find two of the outlaws there . Bring them back to the palace . The king will be grateful . He 's already shown his gratitude . Would the king like to know where the Council of Barons ... - is meeting ? - You know ? Good news , Your Majesty . The baroness earned the gold you sent her . Guards are on their way to seize LittleJohn ... - and another outlaw at Kirkley Hall . - Well done . And she also knows where the Council of Barons is meeting . At Runnymede , Your Majesty . Runnymede . Good . I 'll get them all . But first - Huntington . Come with me . Dubois , there 's something I didn 't tell you . Those men who came here with me - I led them into a trap . - What are you saying ? - They 're Robin Hood 's men . If one of Huntington 's men escapes ... you 'll answer to the king . Guards ! Blessings on you , my son . The king has sent us to give the last rites to the Earl of Huntington . Kindly open the door . I 've seen other determined men . They all talk eventually . Why not save yourself a lot of agony ? No need to lock it . We 'll be but a moment . First things first . Who are you , and what do you want ? The king sent us to offer last rites to the prisoner . Last rites ? A good idea . That may break Huntington 's spirit . One sound and you die . - Friar Tuck . - Aye , Robin ? We 'll soon be back in the forest . - Call the guard in . - Guard . Come in . I need your help . Quiet , if you want to live . Don 't kill me . I was only doing my duty to my king . Ray , somehow we 've got to let him know about the homing post . If I activate it , he may spot it . [ Beeping ] [ Beeping Continues ] Quick , quick , quick . There 's someone coming down the corridor . Engelard ! Behind you - They 're escaping . [ Grunting ] [ Grunts ] Open this door ! [ Gasping ] You dare to lock a door on your king . I 'll see you hanging from the gallows . Let them escape . I 'll butcher every one of them at Runnymede . [ Tony ] This way . ! The rope - Over the parapet . Okay . [ Hoofbeats ] LittleJohn . LittleJohn . - What is it ? - Get up quick . Horses . King 's men . Aye , and on their way in . - We 've got to get out of here . - No , there 's no chance . The only exit leads right to them . We 're done . We 're not done yet . Now , what are you doing ? There 's no time . Get that window open . What ? Hurry ! The window . Now listen . When that pan starts smoking , you take a deep breath . Are you out of your mind ? Get your knife out and be ready to defend yourself , man . - What is it ? - It 's phosphine oxide . Now listen . You go over to that window , you take a deep breath and hold it . And don 't try to resist the soldiers . [ All Coughing ] Magic ! Get another breath of air . As soon as the room clears , we 'll come back and tie them up . Come on . They escaped , Your Majesty . They went over the parapet , into the forest . - Send soldiers after them . - She 's to blame . - Throw her in the dungeon . - No ! No ! No ! Dubois , send couriers to my garrisons . They 're to attack Runnymede . We haven 't time to assemble more of my men . We 'll move to Kirkley Hall and get Douglas and LittleJohn . [ Hoofbeats ] This way . Now . He was the king 's courier . King John has found out where the Council of Barons is meeting . The others must have been couriers too . We must get to Kirkley Hall . [ Horse Whinnying ] We saw those soldiers tied up in the courtyard . Oh , Douglas , here is a magician . He knocked ' em unconscious without striking a blow . Just a little homemade nerve gas . The king is sending an army to ambush the barons at Runnymede . - Then they 've got to be warned . - There 's no time for that . We 've got to capture the king and hold him hostage to keep the peace . That 's a tall order - penetrating a castle and kidnapping a king . This isn 't your fight . If you don 't join us , we 'll understand . Doug . The Time Tunnel sent a homing post into the dungeon . I saw it . Tony , that could be our ticket right back home . We 've gotta find a way to get back into that dungeon . We join them . And the first chance we get , we head for the dungeon . Some of us will scale the walls ... while the others attack the archers on the battlements . We 're gonna be sitting ducks , climbing up those walls . Wait a minute . What we need is a smoke attack . - Smoke attack ? - Right . An old navy trick . [ Shouting ] [ Clamoring ] Here and here and here . Couriers have reached these three garrisons , Your Majesty . They 're awaiting your orders to march . First Runnymede , then we 'll catch and hang Huntington . Your Majesty , there aren 't enough guards to defend the castle . Engelard , we are not defending . We are attacking . Go saddle the horses . When the history of my reign is written ... this will be considered my greatest achievement - How I crushed those who tried ... to force me to grant the Magna Carta ... and how , for all time , I made the power of the king absolute . Yes , Your Majesty . - [ Robin Hood ] Are you almost ready ? - Yes . There it is . All right . Give us a moment to get to the side of the castle ... and then begin the attack . Good luck , Robin . Aim well , lads . Begin ... firing . Your Majesty . ! Your Majesty . ! We 're surrounded by archers . Fire . [ No Audible Dialogue ] We 've got to get to the king . Now 's our chance to get to that homing post . Show me where it is . Here it is . That 's it . We should be traveling within a few seconds . Maybe it 's lost its power . Or maybe the Time Tunnel hasn 't got a fix on us . [ Groans ] Release me . I 'm the king . Yes , Your Majesty , I 'll obey your every command - after we get to Runnymede . [ Grunts ] His Majesty King John ... granting by deed in Runnymede Meadow these rights ... is now respectfully desired ... to impress his seal ... upon this Magna Carta . I , King John ... do hereby impress my seal ... on this ... Magna Carta . But remember - It is the king who grants you these rights . [ Groans ] What 's the matter ? My ankle - I think it 's broken . Maybe you just pulled a tendon . - You think you could walk on it ? - I don 't know . - [ Chattering ] - [ Hammering ] You wait here . I 'll take a look . Japanese . We must be somewhere in the South Pacific - World War II . There 's no doubt about it . Look . - [ Cannons Firing ] - Down ! We 're right in line with their target . Let 's move . - You go on . I 'll catch up . - Nothing doing . Just lean on me . I 'll help you . [ Explosions ] [ Shell Incoming ] I can 't make it . Go on , get out of here . - They 're laying them in right on top of us . - Are you kidding ? Come on ! [ Explosions ] You stay here . I 'll check it out . Watch it . It may be booby-trapped .

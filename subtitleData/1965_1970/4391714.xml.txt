 ( woman laughing ) ( laughing ) : Hey , stop it . ( man and woman laughing ) Hey , wait a minute . I 'm going to get a drink of water . Hey ... don 't be long . All right . ( tail rattling ) Sh ... She will come for this . ( groans ) Beth ? What happened ? Hey , what happened ? It 's a miracle . NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here that they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Barbara Hershey ... Edward Asner . NARRATOR : News of a miracle finds David Vincent and draws him to a small new mexico town . Here , according to legend the Virgin appeared to two Indian children and wept ... her tears forming the spring known as las lagrimas de la Virgen ... the stream where , years later a young girl was presented a gift by a vanishing stranger- - a gift that is , in fact , the heart of an awesome new weapon aimed at mankind . * * Hey , Saint Beth , where you going ? Where 's your halo , huh ? Hey , Saint Beth , make me disappear , okay ? Hey , mister , how about a car wash ? 50 cents . Nope . How about a shoe shine ? Two bits ? Nope . I 'll fill your radiator . A dime . How about a car wash , huh ? I 'll make you a deal- - 35 cents , bargain price . You get it washed in Santa Fe , it 'll cost you a buck . Come on . Johnny , leave the man alone . Okay , Harry . Scram . Okay . What 'll it be ? Draft . One draft . Don 't mind the kid . He 's just an orphan . I let him hang around . Sometimes he gets a little too pushy . You 're Harry Ferguson , aren 't you ? Yeah . I know you ? I read about your daughter . ( laughing ) You ask me , she was high on something . The paper said the man who disappeared gave her a crystal . Mm-hmm . Yeah , it 's over there . ( pinball ringing ) The shrine ... those Indians come over and they stare at that thing for hours . Mind if I look ? Help yourself . Ever think of selling it ? Oh , I thought , all right . I borrowed the case from a jeweler friend in Santa Fe . He says if it was red , it would be a ruby . Then it would be worth plenty . Well , I 'd , uh , offer you 50 bucks for it . How come ? Curiosity . I collect stones . Well now , it seems possible that we might able to come to some sort of agreement . Uh ... okay , boys , the show 's over for today . Uh , my friend and I have business to discuss . That 's it . Man , it 's hot . Look , why don 't we go over and sit by the fan and you can finish your beer and we can finish our business . Now , the point is ... it 's not really mine . You see , my friend offered $ 75 . Maybe you could see your way clear to go a little more . * * Hi . Hi . I haven 't seen you around . I 've been busy . You 've been avoiding me . Please , I have to go . Look , I know what you thought you saw , but I was there , too , remember , honey ? I mean , I didn 't see any such thing . I don 't want to talk about it . Oh , you can 't change like that . Not after what we had going . I can . I did . You can 't change , Beth . You can 't . Leave me alone ! Please , Ricky , just leave me alone . Now , if I was to tell Beth that the price was $ 100 that might make a difference . DAVID : All right , all right ... $ 100 . ( crowbar clatters on floor ) Hey . You must want this thing pretty bad . Vincent came in . He tried to buy the crystal . They 're bringing the weapon down next week . The weapon , Merritt . Without the laser crystal , it will be useless . Vincent . He followed me here . Then we 'll have to send someone to replace you . Do you understand ? Yes . * * Hey , Saint Beth , where have you been ? Hey , Saint Beth , you know why you get headaches ? Your halo 's screwed on too tight . Get him out of here . Go on , kid , beat it . Okay , Harry . Where is it ? It 's all right . I put it in the safe . What did you put it in the safe for ? Somebody tried to steal it . I figured I better lock it up . Well , who tried to steal it ? Some bum . Wait a minute , honey . Come here . Uh ... I want to talk to you . Listen , um ... come here . Listen , this guy came in and he wants to buy it . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . He collects stones . He offered me $ 50 for it , and I told him the jeweler over in Santa Fe offered more , so I got him to offer $ 100 . And I think I can get him to offer more . It 's not for sale . Oh , come on , Beth , how often do you run into 100 bucks ? You know that thing isn 't worth a dime . It 's not to sell . It 's a gift . 100 bucks . You know , I could buy a couple of new barstools , maybe fix up some fancy booths ... you know , make this place a little more attractive- - things would pick up . You know , I tried to borrow at the bank ; they wouldn 't even talk to me . You don 't understand , Daddy . It 's a gift from God . It 's not to buy barstools with and it 's not to fix up your saloon . Now , you listen . I don 't know about miracles but I know about money . I know what it costs to feed you and I know what it costs to put clothes on your back and I know what it costs to send you to Saint Theresa 's . I know . I got no wife to help . I 've been both mother and father for ten years and I 'm going under , baby . I 'm going under . I 'm sorry , Pop . Come on , Beth , it 's not that much of a sin to sell it . I know what it costs you , Pop . And I know what you 'd have to pay a waitress . And Johnny ... I know what you 'd have to pay someone to come in and clean up the way he does . You know , we don 't owe you , Pop , you owe us . A guy tries to be a father , tries to make a decent living , tries to keep a lousy saloon from going under . Hi . You catch that guy ? No . Well ... ( chuckles ) On the house . Look , mister , uh ... Vincent . Vincent . Vincent . Mr. Vincent , um ... my daughter , you know , owns that thing , and I can 't sell it to you . Wait a minute , we have a deal . I love my daughter very much , Mr. Vincent and I 'd rather put a bullet in my head before I 'd do anything to hurt her . The crystal 's not for sale . I 'm sorry . Hello . Oh , the collector . Give you a lift ? Yours ? Oh , I rent it . Nice . My father 's been wanting one of these for years ... ever since my mother died . No , thanks . I 'll walk . Did you come to offer more money for the stone ? Would you accept more ? No . Beth , there are other people after that stone . Because of that , you 're in danger . So is your father . And you 're the only one who can help . For a man who collects rocks , you 've got imagination . Look , I know these people . They 're dangerous . Who are they ? Well , it 's a long story . I don 't know if you 'd believe me . Does anyone ? A few . Trying to convince other people ... you know what it 's like having seen something and no one will believe you . That man in the bar- - was he one of them ? Yes . Look , Beth , you 've got to believe me . Don 't touch me . I don 't like to be touched . I 'm sorry , but you can 't add my rock to your collection . * * Bethel ... What are you doing ? Father ... Miguel , Paco , Sancho , I 'm sure we have work to do . Hmm ? Bethel , put that thing away . Father Paul , I told you ... And get to confession . After all these years of fighting ignorance and superstition ... then you come along with little magic rocks . It was a miracle . Don 't tell me what 's miraculous ! That 's not for you to say ! The Church proclaims miracles ! Yes , Father . I 'm sorry . I have a harsh and brutal temper . I 've hurt you very much . I 'm sorry . That 's all right , Father . Bethel ... miracles are rare and special . Often our eyes tell us things that are not so . So , no more magic shows , all right ? Yes , Father . I 'll walk back . I need the walk . Is there anything , anyone you won 't use ? No . Beth , if you don 't want the money I 'll give it to the Church . $ 500 for Santa Theresa 's . You can 't buy god , Mr. Vincent . Oh ... her mother was just like her . Full of fight . She ran off about ten years ago . I 've been father and mother to that girl ever since . Mr. Vincent ... I 'll sell you the stone . It 's not yours . Oh , I 'll take care of Beth all right . Only ... the price has gone up . Listen to me . There are others who are willing to kill you for that stone . You better sell and sell now . $ 1,000 . I 'll have to go to the bank in Santa Fe . And call New York . Call . How about a beer ? No , thanks . Go away , Johnny . They say in town that he offered $ 500 . $ 500 , Beth . Go away . That 's what we need . Bus fare , food ... and money to pay your uncle . My uncle ? Oh , that was a long time ago . He might not even remember me . It was just silly talk , Johnny . It wasn 't . It wasn 't silly . Your uncle ... I only met him once . But he 's your uncle . He said he liked you . It was after my mother died . He ... felt sorry for me . That big house , and no kids of his own . We could help clean up the house . I could cook and sew . He has a dog . You told me he has a dog . A mutt . And he likes kids . No more saloon . No more glasses to wash . No more men grabbing , touching . $ 500 will take us there . Oh , no , no , Johnny . It 's a dream . It 's like a movie . After it 's over , you go home . You ... wake up . It doesn 't have to be . I don 't know what 's real and what isn 't anymore . The $ 500 is real ... and the bus tickets . Maybe , Johnny . Let me stay here and think about it for a while . My child , I 've come for the gift . Open the safe , Pop- - I 've got to take it now . Beth , I got something to tell you . Pop , she came for it . A nun , the most beautiful person , Daddy . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Open up the safe , Daddy . Wait a minute ! Vincent offered $ 1,000 for it . Daddy , I told you ... $ 1,000 , Beth ! $ 1,000 ! No . I can fix up the place and we can start making a profit . We can rent a little house . I don 't want my little girl living over a saloon . You can 't do it , Pop . I won 't let you . Your mama wouldn 't have run off if I 'd had money . Don 't . You would have had your mama , Beth . The only reason she ran off is she couldn 't stand the bar and living upstairs and taking care of you up there . She ran off because she was no good ! No , it was the bar ! The crummy bar ! And no money . Pop , I 'm going to take the stone . Over my dead body . You ain 't giving that stone to no nun . She wants it , let her pay for it . They got plenty . Like everybody pays for everything . But I ain 't opening that safe for nobody unless they pay as much as David Vincent . * * Mr. Vincent ... Yes . You offered my father $ 1,000 . That 's right . Please don 't do it . Please . Well , Beth , I have to . I just came back from Santa Fe ... You don 't understand . My father thinks $ 1,000 would change his whole life . He 's built up some crazy idea he can get my mom back . Wait a minute . I thought your mother was dead . My mother ran away ten years ago with a whisky salesman in a red convertible . Because she was no good . Now , wait a minute , Beth ... She was just no good . And she 's my mom , I 'm her daughter and I 'm no good , either . Beth ... Can 't you see ? I 'm her daughter and I 'm no good . Beth ... What do you think I was doing by that stream ? Now , just sit down for a minute , huh ... My life was ashes . Dirt . Then he came along and gave me that stone . Now I 'm clean again . Don 't you see ? Beth , I know what you think that stone is but you 're wrong . Then what is it ? Part of a weapon . Then why would someone from the Church come for it ? Who came for it ? A sister . She came to me at the stream . I doubt if she was from the Church . Beth , come quick . Your father 's been robbed . They took the crystal . Daddy ... Who was it ? Two men . I don 't know . ( groaning ) What happened ? I was robbed . They sapped me . Beth , you better call a doctor . No , no , I don 't need one . What 'd they look like , Harry ? They came up behind . Two men ... big . What 'd they get ? Uh ... I had a hundred in the safe . DEPUTY : We 've got some first aid stuff down at the station . You can fill in the details there . Come on , I 'll help you to my car . Can you make it ? Yeah . All right , come on . Now that you 've got what you want when are you leaving ? I don 't have it . You did it , or had it done . All right . Now get out of Lagrimas and leave us alone . Beth , who else wanted it ? ( record of " The Blue Danube Waltz " playing ) ( music continues muffled ) * * Hi . We 're not open . Heard you were robbed last night . That 's right . That 's too bad . Lose much ? Yes . Look , I said we 're not open . Business as usual . She said we 're not open . You keep quiet , hot shot . It isn 't any of your affair . Leave him alone . I thought maybe you 'd have some free time ... being closed and all . Maybe you aren 't as busy as you 've been lately . You 've been so busy so long . Such a long time . Go away . Sure . How 's your daddy ? They released him this morning . Glad he 's all right . Yeah , well , uh ... he 's down at the sheriff 's station looking at pictures . Mm-hmm . He should be gone most of the afternoon . Oh . What do you say we get out of this firetrap and , uh ... No . I 've been lonesome for you , baby . Real lonesome . Later . This afternoon , maybe , please ? This afternoon . ( motorcycle departing ) Beth ? Well ? He either has it hidden where I couldn 't find it or he didn 't take it . He took it . How could he get there before us ? I saw him drive into town . He stole it and then doubled back . Stay with him . You know where I 'll be . ( phone ringing ) ( ringing continues ) ( knocking ) Come in . Good morning . Just get up ? Yep . What did you do with the crystal ? I don 't have the crystal . You 've got it ... and I want it . I 'll do anything to get it . Beth , I 've already told you I don 't have the crystal . You have it . You 're a man . You take what you want . Men do take what they want , don 't they , David ? You don 't have to do this . But I promised the sister I 'd bring her the crystal . Don 't you know what that means , David ? Now , you listen to me ... I , uh , work with a group of about six people . We 're after that crystal . We don 't have it yet but we want it to take to washington to prove to the government that I 'm not lying . About what ? The other people ... who want the crystal ... aren 't human . They 're from another world , another planet . They make themselves appear to be human . And when they die , they begin to glow and they disappear . Are you asking me to believe that the man at the stream ... ? And the nun . They 're here to destroy us . You 're an evil man , Mr. Vincent , or else insane . I only hope God can forgive you . Did you get what you came for ? What do you think I came for ? A piece of junk . Your miracle . I 'm sorry , Johnny . He didn 't give you back your piece of junk , did he ? No matter what you did . No . He couldn 't . He doesn 't have it . Who does ? Oh , please tell me , Johnny . Please ? ( phone rings ) Hello ? HARRY : Mr. Vincent ? It 's Vincent . I got a proposition for you ... David . ( eerie electronic pulsing ) ( pulsing intensifies ) David ! David ... What is it ? You were right- - I saw her . She was in a glass tube . Where ? Down in the old burned-out barn . We 'll take my car . It was here . They must 've seen you . You were right and I didn 't believe you . Who are they ? What do they want ? The world . What 's the crystal ? It 's part of a very powerful weapon . I should 've let my father sell it to you . I 'm sorry , David . ( truck door closes ) Listen ... if they don 't have that medicine in Santa Fe you call the doctor , huh ? He 'll tell you where you can get it . ( engine starting ) Vincent ? Yes . Did you bring the money ? Where 's the crystal ? It 's in here . ( latch clicking ) Why the phony robbery ? I had to get it away from Beth , didn 't I ? A man likes to keep his daughter 's respect . He just doesn 't walk around selling her stuff . It 's all there . How will you explain the money ? Insurance . Besides , let me worry about my daughter . Now , only you and me know that money 's in there . So let 's keep it that way , huh ? I 'll let you out . What 's the matter ? You hear something ? ( gunshot ) Hey ... the money . Wait a minute- - this place is going to blow any minute . The money ! Did you save the crystal ? I know he had it . There wasn 't any medicine at the drugstore . Uh , yes . I 'm taking it to Washington . Were you able to save anything ? A $ 50 bill . What 's left of it . Mmm . That money was for you , you know . Oh , no , thank you . No more lies . He didn 't want it for me . He just wanted it . Where will you be staying ? I don 't know . I have an uncle in Denver . We could stay there . For real ? For real . Beth , uh ... your father didn 't drive as hard a bargain as I thought he would- - as a matter of fact , I ... I got some extra cash in case he raised the price again . I 'd like you to have it . Please . Thank you . You 're welcome . How about carrying my coat , huh ? So long . Good-bye , David . NARRATOR : So David Vincent leaves Lagrimas , New Mexico with a crystal from an alien planet .

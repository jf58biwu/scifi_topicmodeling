 * * ( eerie whirring ) ( crackling ) * * * * * * * ( vehicle approaching ) NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Barbara Barrie . Richard Anderson . Paul Mantee . NARRATOR : For two days , planes have crossed and recrossed the Utah wilderness searching for some clue to the fiery object witnesses swear plunged from the sky . But the planes find nothing and the investigation is called off . Only one man continues the search . For somewhere in the forbidding mountains may be the remains of an alien spacecraft . It 's starting again . All right . Come over here and let me give you another injection ... Not yet . Not yet . You 're in pain . Now , let me help you ! We don 't know how this can affect me . It 's experimental . Part of the reason I 'm here . Listen to me . Pain is for a purpose . It 's a warning that you need help . I 'll get help as soon as I complete this mission . You need help before then . They 'll take me to one of our regeneration stations . The injections are wearing off too quickly . You keep talking about this rendezvous that you have to make this afternoon . How do you know your two friends aren 't there right now ? Why don 't you let me go up to the mine office ... Why are you so concerned about me ? I know this needle has kept me alive . You could 've let me die . Why didn 't you ? I 'm a nurse . That doesn 't answer my question . You saw the ship . You guessed what I am . You don 't show the fear emotions humans are supposed to . Why ? I 've just come back from a year in Vietnam . After what I 've seen there , nothing 's ever going to frighten me again . I 'm not like anything you 've ever seen . Maybe . But in the meantime , why don 't you try trusting me ? Humans ? Oh , no . No . I 've heard about you . You fight . You hate . You kill . You betray each other . It 's the only way you know . You do it to each other and you 'll do it to me , if you get the chance . ( phone ringing ) Hello . Hello , Gale . Remember me ? Oh , Vern . Yes . Uh , how 's everything ? Well , pretty slow since all that saucer fuss . Say , I , uh , I 'd like to come by tonight , if it 's okay . You 've been back a week , and , uh ... Oh , well , uh , I 'm pretty tied up right now . How about some other time ? Oh , uh ... uh , doing what ? Oh , trying to get this ranch into shape . Maybe in a few days . Yeah . Sure . Sure , Gale . When you 're not so jammed up . Bye . You see ? We don 't all betray each other . Someone 's coming . There can 't be . No one ever comes up here this time of day . Who is it ? I can 't tell from here . You found out a way to get help after all , didn 't you , huh ? How could I ? I 've been with you every minute . Find out who it is and get rid of him . All right . Go into the kitchen . No , no , no . I 'll stay here . You go out and meet him . You trust me that far ? It 's not a question of trust . Now get going . All right . Give me the keys to the jeep . And I 'll take this . It 's not loaded . You took all the shells out , remember ? But he 's not going to know that . This land is posted . Who are you ? My name is David Vincent . I 'd like to talk to Mr. Frazer . Miss Frazer . This is my ranch . What do you want ? Well , I 'm trying to get back up into those mountains . The only place this road leads is to my ranch . What are you looking for ? Well , I 'm looking for whatever fell into the mountains a couple of nights ago . Oh , I heard those reports . There 's nothing there . They called off the search . Well , they were looking for a plane ; I 'm not . Just what are you looking for ? Well , it would take a long time to explain and I 'm afraid you wouldn 't believe me . Thank you . I 'll go back to the mine and try to find that road . No , Mister , uh ... Vincent ? Right . This land is mine , all the way up to that ridge . Now , unless you have government business on this property ... You don 't , do you ? No . I don 't . Well , you 're trespassing . So please get off . Well , maybe I should explain why I 'm going up there . Get out . * * * * Who was it ? I 'm not sure . Come on . Come on . Who was it ? Well , he 's gone . You don 't have to worry . What does that mean ? Well , he ... he 's not from the Aeronautics Board . At least he said he wasn 't here on government business . But he said he wanted to get to the place where your ship crashed . And he said he wasn 't looking for a plane . And , uh ... you let him go , huh ? I sent him back to town . What else could I do ? And you think that he 's going to go back to town , because you , uh , you said so ? I got to get up to that clearing . You 're too weak to make it . Sit there . Drink this . I 've got to make it . Even if he finds that clearing , there 's nothing there . You destroyed the ship . The courier 's box is hidden there . I was supposed to land him safely ; I failed . Now I have to finish his mission for him . But you hid the box . Why don 't you wait until your ... friends get here this afternoon and then send them for it ? You said you wanted to help me . I need your help . Will you ? ( footsteps approaching ) Don 't . He 's going to carry the box to the jeep . Get back . He 's sick . Can 't you see that ? Get back . He 's suffering , Mr. Vincent . He needs me and I 'm going to help him . Highway department says that storm 's going to be a big one . Well , there 's nothing we can do about it . We better call the ranchers and give them the word . Thought we was all done with visitors . Now , you go make your calls and don 't forget Gale Frazer 's place . Right . Morning , Sheriff . This is Mr. Lavin . Sheriff . How are ya ? My name is Sawyer . How are you ? Our company has just bought out the Aurelia Mine . I wonder if you could tell us how to get up there ? Now , who 'd want to do a fool thing like that ? That mine was run dry long before they closed it . Well , the record says there 's enough low-grade ore to work with our new equipment . Can 't scrape meat off a chewed bone . We want to find out how chewed . A man from the mine department is meeting us up there this afternoon . Not wanting to wish you any bad luck- - 'cause , Lord knows , we could use that mine- - I think you 're going to find ore like they found that flying saucer . Flying saucer ? Yeah , that 's what some folks called it . That 's what all the excitement was about . I thought even the big city papers would print that . Well , maybe they did . We 've been traveling around a great deal . What saucer ? It came down back of the old Frazer place . If you ask me , it came from the same place as that ore of yours . Had to be a trick of some kind or the government men would have found it . Oh , then there was a search ? For two days . Planes covered every inch of those hills . Well , I 'll leave you two be so you can go over your assets- - that is , if you call mice assets . Just turn your car around , take that road up into the hills about three miles . Thank you , Sheriff . Oh , if you 're hungry , uh , try Henry 's across the alley . Opening old mines ... flying saucers ... well , you live long enough , you see everything . Do you have to do that ? No matter where he 's from , he 's ill . Look , I 've proven to you that I 'm not one of them . I 'm just a nurse , and I want to help him . His body is a shell . It 's an imitation . He 's not in pain . I 've treated enough wounded men to know that he 's in shock . Well , let 's get him to a doctor . Don 't you understand ? He won 't make it that far . I have some medication at the ranch that might help him . Or do you want him to die ? He 's reverting to his own form . The form he had before he assumed this body . He 'll never survive . Please , then let 's get him to the ranch . Well , has anybody else tried that number ? I 've been trying to get her about a half hour . Well , keep trying , Millie . Trouble ? I 've reached everybody except Gale , Sheriff . I think the phone 's out up there . Yeah , try it again , Millie . All right . Thanks , Millie . Phone 's dead , all right . Her road 'll go fast if that storm 's as bad as they say it is . You better get up there and warn her in case she hasn 't heard the radio . She might want to come in town until it blows over . The way she 's been keeping herself shut away up there since she come back , she might welcome it . Vern ... I know how you felt about Gale , and still do but she 's been through a lot . Give her a little time . If she asks what you 're doing up there , tell her I sent you . Official business . I 'll get back as soon as I can . ( door shuts ) The reversion 's stopped . It only affected his hands . If he hadn 't disconnected the phone , I could have gone into town for help . You had your chance when you first met me . I know I had the chance but I didn 't know who you were . I didn 't know what you 'd do . As long as you understand one thing- - they 're here to take over the earth . How do you know ? I 've seen others . I 've seen what they 've done here . We 're the killers , Mr. Vincent . You 've seen what they 've had to do to defend themselves against us . How do you know they 're not here on a mission of peace ? You want us to extend a helping hand , right ? That 's right . And after they bite it off ? I only know one thing . He could have killed me , and he didn 't . Doesn 't that mean anything to you ? He needs you to keep him alive until he finishes his mission . You 're judging him by the way we act- - a " civilized " people . All we know how to do is kill . Anything that 's strange or unlike us doesn 't have a chance . I have to get him to town . Untie his hands . Or do you think he 's going to run away ? How soon will this stuff take effect ? I don 't know . We 're dealing with a completely different symptom . Mr. Vincent , is there anything else you can tell me about this ... reversion process ? I might be able to do something . The only other person who 's seen an alien in that form went insane . All I know is that they can 't survive here in their native form . Doesn 't that prove you 're wrong ? Why would they want to take over the world if they can 't survive here ? The answer may be in that box . Did he say where he was going to deliver it ? To the mine they bought . Why can 't you let him go ? It doesn 't make any difference whether you 're right or I 'm right about why they 're here but if we turn him in , and he dies , then we killed him . I 've had enough killing . My father died in one war . My brother died in a war they didn 't even call a war . Never mind . It 's a world I don 't understand anymore . I thought if I ... came here to the ranch , I might find some reason ... but I can 't . ( horn honking ) It 's the sheriff 's car . Won 't you listen to me ? Won 't you let him go ? He won 't be harmed . Who are you ? My name is David Vincent . Where 's Gale ? Inside . What is that supposed to be ? A gun . I have a prisoner inside . He 's sick . I 'll explain while we get him back to town . Gale , what 's this all about ? Let him tell you . He 's in the bedroom . You 'll understand when you see him . All right , show me what 's going on . His hands ! What 's the matter with his hands ? A mission of peace . Your company sure bought a pig in a poke . Map 's not even right . This ain 't the main shaft . It 's over here near the Frazer place . Frazer ? Is that where this , uh , " saucer " came down ? Yeah , right here . The man in the restaurant gave us quite a description of what he saw . Give that old fool another week , he 'll swear the moon fell down . Well , you haven 't been too encouraging , Sheriff , but at least you 've been honest about the mine . Yes . Well , let 's see what our man in the department says . I 'll tell you what . My deputy 's up at the Frazer place now . I 'll give him a call and have him keep an eye out for your man . This is no time to be caught out if that storm 's as bad as they keep saying it is . That Frazer road will wash out first thing . Vern . Come in , Vern . Thanks a lot for your help , Sheriff . My pleasure . Now , Vern , you answer me . What do you think I 'm paying you for ? Come in , Vern . Vern , you get on that radio , you hear me ? If you 're going to get rid of us , do it . That would be foolish . I need you . Did you have to kill him ? He was no use to me . Is that all you care about- - what use people are to you ? ( chuckles ) Primitive people . Lives ruled by emotions . Don 't you feel anything ? You 're trying to understand him in our terms . It doesn 't work . I just want to know one thing . When you 're done with us ... do we die , too ? Sorry , Mr. Vincent , I should have listened to you . It 's almost time . You know what to do . You think I 'm still going to help you ? I started to revert once . I can 't afford to let it happen again . No . He 's my assurance that you will . I learned from you how valuable even one life is . You won 't sacrifice his . Do as he says . The longer I stay alive , the better chance we have of stopping him . You 've gone to a lot of trouble for this rendezvous- - buying a mine company . Why the fancy game ? It 's no game . We intend to use those mines . We have to feel free to move our equipment in for our experiments without any suspicion . The material for this experiment ... is in that box . That 's right . And I will deliver them this afternoon . No , Mr. Blake , you won 't deliver them . If you have another attack , nothing is going to help you . You see this ? It 's smashed . You did it when you killed Vern . I can 't do anything more for you . Find another . I have no other . W-w-w-we 'll get one at your village . Willing to risk that ? There 's no risk , Mr. Vincent . You 'll see . No , Millie , I don 't know what happened to his radio . Just keep checking the ranches at the other end . Maybe he stopped at , oh , the Thompsons ' or the Whites ' . You be as quick as you can . If you try anything , I 'll kill you . Gale ! Hello , Sheriff . How are you ? Oh , I see Vern did get to you , then . Vern ? Yes , I sent him out to warn you there 's a big storm coming . You telling me you haven 't seen him ? I haven 't seen him , Sheriff . Well , I 'll be darned . I 'll have to find out where that young fella 's been . Anyway , it was smart of you to come into town before it hit . I-I 'm not staying . I just , uh ... I just brought some friends in to get some supplies . You 'll die , too . We 'd better get back , Gale . I 've ... I 've got to get back . Well , I think it 's a darn silly idea , but it 's your business . Look , you sure you haven 't seen Vern ? I wish I could tell you that I had . * * Survivors . You all right ? Yes . Why don 't you let me drive ? No , it 's all right . It keeps me occupied . Besides , I know the road . My ... hands ... it 's begun . How far are we from the mine ? I can 't tell from here . Maybe 100 yards or so . Can you hold out that long ? Keep going . Can you walk ? Yes . Let 's get inside . The keys . Look , we couldn 't get away if we wanted to . The keys . ( keys clinking ) Now let 's get inside . Take the box . Leave it here . The box ! All right . There 's a lantern over there . ( thunder rumbling ) You said there was a stove . In the corner . I 'll get some wood . Gale . Hurry . I 'll start the fire . Is this what you need ? I can 't help you anymore . The box . He took it with him . Where ? The mine . ( thunder crashing ) Hmm . Humans . Hmm . You humans ... puzzle me . You fight to stay alive , and then you ask to die . You guard your lives and then you sacrifice them pointlessly . Why ? With us , you know why . If I don 't accomplish this mission , there will be plenty of others to take my place . And what is your mission ? What 's in that box ? ( groaning ) Doesn 't matter . If we 're going to be killed , I want to know why . So that we can live here . We 're going to experiment with the chemicals in that box- - experiment to perhaps change our chemistry so that we can use the oxygen in your atmosphere even in our native form . And if it doesn 't ? Will you go away , then , and leave us alone ? No . We 'll simply eliminate the oxygen . Eliminate the oxygen ? And kill every living thing ? Yes . Mr. Vincent ... I know now that what I did was worth doing . Was it even worth the pain of dying ? You know , don 't you ? You have the same fears . You haven 't been fighting to stay alive just because you have a mission . You 're like us . You 're in pain and you 're afraid to die . Something must have happened to you in that crash . It changed you . My will to survive is as strong as yours . No medicine is going to save you now . At least spare us . Thank you very much , Mr. Vincent . Thank you for reminding me . I 'm going to die . It 's time to admit that and time to carry out my responsibility . There 's a tunnel somewhere that leads to the ranch if I can find it . Vincent ! Let 's go . ( thunder crashing ) Where are you ? He 's reverting . Can you find that tunnel that leads to the ranch ? I don 't know . It 's up above , I think . We 'll have to go back that way . * * This is the way . I 'm sure it is . Vincent ! ( coughing ) What about this way ? No- - no good . Wait ! Wait ! Got caught up in that storm . Just made it up here . What 's wrong ? ( footsteps approaching ) Lavin ? Sawyer ? Blake ... ! The box- - where is it ? Destroyed . Help . I need help . There is no help . We 're all finished here . Get rid of them . All of them . ( groaning ) Vincent ... help me . My hands ... the pain ... Do something ... anything . Stop the pain . ( thunder crashing ) I never did see a storm as bad as that one . I never could have gotten through it without you . Neither could I. What are your plans ? Oh , I don 't know . They haven 't taken over yet . Until they do , I 'm still a nurse and there are still lots of people who need me . I wish we hadn 't killed a man , David . Blake wasn 't a man . To me , he was . I 'm sorry Vern had to die . Will you drop me in town ? Sure . What about your plans ? What will you be doing ? I don 't know . I suppose more of the same . Let 's go . NARRATOR : David Vincent 's war is unrecognized , unheralded . Its battlefields can be anywhere ... anywhere the invader has carved out a stronghold . David Vincent 's war will have no ending until the invader is driven back to his own world or until he has made David Vincent 's world his own .

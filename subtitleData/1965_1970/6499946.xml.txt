 ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) Prisoner : Where am I ? Man : In the village . What do you want ? Information . Whose side are you on ? That would be telling . We want information . Information ... Information ... You won 't get it . ( Bubbling ) By hook or by crook we will . Who are you ? I am number two . Who is number one ? You are number six . I am not a number , I am a free man ! ( Number two laughs fiendishly ) ( Phone beeping ) Number two here . Yes , sir , I am doing my best . He 's very difficult ... I know it 's important , sir ... He 's no ordinary person , sir , but if I had a free hand ... I know , sir , yes . I know I 'm not indispensable . Get me number 14 . Number 14 ? The experiment must come forward . Woman : Impossible ! I need all of a week . I haven 't got a week . I haven 't even finished testing it on animals , let alone people . Then now 's your chance . When ? Tonight . ( Thunder crashing ) ( Wind blowing ) Stop ! Don 't bring that wet in here ! Take your macs and boots off . ( Thunder crashing ) This brainchild of yours had better work ... For your sake . If this man is damaged I shall hold you responsible . You know I haven 't had a chance to prove the drug . Just get it right . Or I 'll see that it 's proved on you . ( Equipment beeping ) What 's all that about ? Energy from his brain . Thoughts , like sound waves . Converted into electrical impulses and finally ... Into pictures . Extraordinary . How very single-minded . He 's not conventional . I sometimes think he 's not human . It 's an anguish pattern . So this is your wonder drug . Yes . Three doses ... And that 's the absolute limit . Why ? Three 's dangerous enough . Four would kill him . His mind is now yours . What do you want from it ? Why he resigned . I believe that he was going to sell out . I want to know what he had to sell and to whom he was going to sell it . We 've researched and computed his whole life and it boils down to three people . " A " , " b " , and " C " . He must meet each one of them . We shall then know what would have happened if we had not got to him first . Where do you want them to meet ? Paris . They have one thing in common . They all attended madame engadine 's celebrated parties . Here 's some film of the most recent . ( Turns on monitor ) Number 14 : Ah ... nothing like a good party . I 'm sure he 'll welcome the change of environment . Go on , feed it into him . ( Grunts ) Is he all right ? So far . The moment of truth . ( Pleasant orchestral music playing ) ( General conversation ) Good evening . Very nice . Good evening . Engadine ! Darling ! ( Laughs ) How are you ? Mmm ... I 'm so happy you are here . You look as wonderful as ever . I should ... what it costs ! Oh , yi-yi ! Uh-uh ... You look tired , darling . Things are bad ? No , not now ... I 'm starting a holiday . Oh ... the English holiday ? Big boots and fishing sticks ? Not quite like that . Where , then ? Somewhere different , somewhere quiet , where I can think . Oh ... there is no quiet anywhere . Ah ... Hello ? ! Hello . Sorry , darling . I come back soon , eh ? Of course , yes . Uh-uh . And remember ... you 're mine . Really ? Be horrible to other women . I promise . Oh , thank you . ( Kisses ) See you anon . I think it 's time we introduced " a " . His face looks vaguely familiar . What 's his real name ? I 'm surprised you don 't remember him . He made world news a few years ago . Excuse me , I 'll be immediately back . I 'm surprised . Not unpleasantly , I trust . I knew you came to these parties . And wondered why we never met ? She 's a tactful lady , she 's kept us apart . Till tonight . Perhaps tonight is special . I feel it is special , too . ( Chuckles ) To us . As we are , or as we were ? Oh , I remember him . He defected about six years ago . It 's been a long time . Not long enough . We used to be friends . Once . With a lot in common . That 's in the past . Then let 's think of the future . We 're still the same people . Working for different sides . Sides don 't matter . Only success . In that case , we should still have a great deal in common . We do the same jobs . For different reasons , yes . ( Chuckles ) I see you still overrate absolute truth . Whatever way you look at it we both want to conquer the world . I hope you 're , uh ... Happy in your new life . New life ? News of old friends travels quickly . In a few hours . To you and to me , news is like air . We breathe it deeply . We draw it from far and wide . If it 's interesting . What are you going to do with your freedom ? Go fishing . ( Chuckles ) Perhaps you 're fishing now . What 's your price ? What am I selling ? I 'm anxious to find out . Madame 's wine ... It 's always excellent . If you haven 't got a price ... You must have a reason . Not always the same thing . Excuse me . He 's going ... And we haven 't found out a thing . He must not go . Number 14 : He 's only doing what he would have done . I can only create the situation . Get him back . It 's his dream . It must take its course . You never could take a hint . I don 't want a hint . I want you . ( 5178,05 fingers ) I 'm saving myself money . Paris hasn 't changed much , has it ? Where are they going ? I don 't know , but it 's what would have happened . That 's what you wanted . Well , you 're in my country now . Oh , diplomatic immunity . ( Chuckles ) I like travel ... it broadens the , um ... Mind ! You daren 't shoot me . Oh , that 's much better . Let us stay on different sides , please . Be seeing you . At least I know it wasn 't " a " he was selling out to . ( Flicks switch ) No ! Let 's try the second dose . Let 's get on to " b " . He must rest first . How long ? 24 hours . Why ? It 's a very dangerous drug . He must have time to readjust . ( Grunts ) Woman : I meet everybody . I know everything . Who is sick , who is getting better . Be seeing you . ( General conversation ) My handbook on social etiquette doesn 't deal with this . How does one talk to someone that one has met in a dream ? Look , uh , number ... ? Six ? Six . I 'm usually a social animal , but not now . Another time ? Last week , number 14 was an old lady in a wheelchair . You 're new here , and you 're one of them . Your nonsense bores me . Oh , my mistake . Don 't worry . We all have to make mistakes . Sometimes we have to . ( Phone beeps ) Yes ? Oh , really ? Send him in . Come in , my dear fellow . Come and sit down . I 'm not tired ... I slept well . Good . We don 't seem to have seen a lot of each other . I haven 't seen very much of you . I don 't spend all my time spying . Don 't you ? Your predecessors did . Hmm , I have other things to do . Now , all this nonsense about why you resigned ... If people can 't Chuck up a job things have come to a pretty pass . Do sit down . I 'm still not tired . In that case , perhaps you 'd pour me out some milk . I didn 't have a very good night . Oh ? Thank you . A pleasure . Your milk . Thank you . Milk is the perfect food . It creates good temper . Would you like some ? My temper 's fine . Anyone who had nothing to hide would ask where I got it . Where did you get it , number six ? In my sleep . Oh , you must have been restless . Perhaps you need a checkup . I have a favorite doctor . Really ? Number 14 . ( Phone beeping ) Sir ... ? Yes , sir , within two days , you have my word ... Yes , sir , I realize my future 's at stake . Two days , I guarantee . ( Guitar music playing softly ) Good night , sir . Good night . Music playing y where have you been , darling ? Been ? Oh ... ( Laughs ) Men always evade questions . All my husbands did . Ah , yes . Where is my other handsome guest ? Who ? Your old friend . You were talking to him . Oh , he 's ... he 's gone . Ah , just like that ? How very rude . Without saying good-bye ? Anyway , I never did like that man . It doesn 't matter . Madame , excusez-moi ? Gui ' , je viens . Merci ' . I 'll see you later , darling ? Yes . Good-bye . Time for " b " . She even looks like a spy . She 's a very good one from a long line of spies . He 's full of the party spirit , isn 't he ? Where is she ? I don 't know . She should be there . I think he 's resisting . Don 't you know ? It may take longer for the drug to work this time . Wait . Maybe he 's seen someone . Ah ... chuckles ) No ... no , that 's certainly not " b " . I expect she 's there somewhere . I very much hope so . Ah , lucette , I was looking for you . What have you been up to ? Nothing , madame . I was helping Louis to collect the glasses . Ah ... What is that , lucette ? A note , madame . A lady ... She gave it to me . No , madame , it 's for ... Thank you , lucette . It 's for you . Hmm ? Well ... A woman 's hand . Mm-hmm . I 'm jealous . What does she want ? I dare not tell you . Oh ... To meet her in the arbor . Oh ? My guest , at my party , in the arbor . She 's an old friend . Oh , there is no name . Old friends don 't need names . Then you prefer her to me . All right , all right , I shall go . The party 's finished ! Finished ! ( Laughs ) Enjoy yourself . ( Cork pops ) I 'd recognize that signal anywhere . Let 's get distressed together . There we are . You are still the most intriguing spy I have ever met . It 's taken a lot of thought and experience . Last I remember , you were hiking across the mountains to , uh , Switzerland ? I got sore feet . You should have stayed . I have no friends there . Your enemy is a very bad loser . He was here earlier . Does he know you 're back ? His chums are all over the place . He and I had a little ride together . I left him in a most unforgiving mood . He may return . Oh , being killed is an occupational hazard . Like a sitting duck ? Don 't worry . Tonight 's a party . You used to be ... A very good dancer . I still am . Are you ? Mm-hmm . Where are you going for your holiday ? ( Chuckles ) Ah ... so you 've heard ? I , um ... I don 't know yet . A long one ? Oh , a very long one . Why ? I need time to think . ( Laughs ) I can 't bear to think . I can 't bear to be alone . Can 't you ? That 's why I like parties . I drown myself in chatter . Tonight , there is no need for that . Just ... dance . He 's far too relaxed . ( Moans ) He may be there , but he 's not here . With this kind of resistance he 'll burn up the drug in no time . We haven 't got long . Then you 'd better do something about it . The only way to manipulate his dreams is to get into them . Is that possible ? I was wondering . What ? If we could put words into her mouth . Go on ... how ? We fed him with pictures . Why can 't we feed him with sound ? But the voice ? Would he hear yours or hers ? That 's the danger . If he hears my voice and recognizes it the shock will wake him , he 'll see everything ... We 'll have failed . We must make the most of this chance or we 'll never know if it was " b " . It 's the absolute worst time to try anything . Just look at the state he 's in . Where 's your scientific enthusiasm ? What shall I say ? Anything . Try it . Shall we have some more ? Shall we have some more ? More ? Champagne ? Champagne ? Not yet . Now get to the point . You said we hadn 't long . I wonder if they will kill me . I wonder if they will kill me . I thought you didn 't care . I do . I 'll help you . You know that . They are here to kill me . They want me to make a deal with you . They want to know why you 've resigned . Go on . If you 'd just talk about it , they 'd let me off the hook . If you 'd just talk about it , they 'd let me off the hook . Are you shocked ? I 'm surprised . I can 't believe it 's you . I 'm such a mess . I need something to swap . Will you meet them ? They 're here now . Don 't hate me . We all make mistakes . Sometimes we have to . Have you the feeling that you 're being manipulated ? Manipulated ? Who are you ? ! They 're here . If you don 't tell them , they 'll kill me ! You are not who you pretend to be . Excuse me . Tell him . He 'll kill me ! I don 't believe in you . He 'll kill me ! How long has your husband been dead ? Four years . Four years . Four years . How old is your son now ? Sow ? Husband , yes , but there 's no son . Help me , please . Help me , please ! What is your son 's name ? That 's an easier question . Thought you couldn 't answer . Come back ! Don 't leave me ! Come back ! I can explain everything ! Please ! ( Bell tolling in distance ) ( Door buzzes ) ( Door buzzes ) ( Turns on machine ) Music playing y ( turns off machine ) I couldn 't sleep . What 's that number six doing ? ( Sighs ) He 's always walking . Irritating man . Doesn 't he ever get tired ? ! Be seeing you . No ! I 'll be seeing you . Right . ( Rock music playing ) That 's not ... What 's gone wrong ? The strain 's too much for him . I 'm going to stop it . No ! It 's our last chance . It 's now or never . Number 14 : On your head . I 'll worry about that later . Haven 't they killed you yet ? Sorry ... must have been thinking of someone else . It 's so wild , darling . It will end in tears . All the best parties do . Oh , it 's terrible ! ( Laughing ) Terrible ? ! It 's dreamy ! This is a dreamy party ! We 'll have to hurry . Get me " C " ' s picture . There isn 't one . This is all we have on him . " Known to be French , known to have attended " engadine 's parties , probably disguised . Known to have been in contact with number six . " How do you expect me to bring them together if there 's no picture ? It 's a process of elimination . " C " is the only one left . He 'll find him . Well , he 'll have to hurry . Champagne ... we all need more champagne . Watch him for me , will you , darling ? He is the last sane man in the world . I like sane men . Are you in business ? I was . You 're young to retire . Age is relative . Meaning you 're free ? Possibly . I ... know of something . And the pay is very good . I 'm free . Number six . I 'm sure it 's your lucky number . Croupier : Les jeux sont faits . Rien ne va plus . Six . Noir . Gagnant . Pour LA service , monsieur . It can 't be her . She can 't be " C " . ( Conga playing ) It takes you a long time to sell yourself , darling . It took a lot of thought . Come on . This way . She 's fooled us for years . But not any longer . We 're bringing her to the village ? Yes . You are sure ? No change of mind ? No change of mind . And no doubt ? Not anymore . It 's a one-way journey . You have the fare ? Yes . These papers from London . If you want to go back , you can . Back to the party . Back to your life . But ... once through this door you can never return . This is what I 've been waiting for . ( Groaning ) It 's gone dead ! What 's happened ? He 's collapsed ! That 's it ... we 've pushed him as far as we dare . No , I must have that dream back . You know who " C " is . Yes , but I still don 't know what he was selling . And if it kills him ? I shall have to take that risk . I 'll try a heart stimulant . Hold this . Where are you taking me ? To the summit . To hand over your papers . Not to you ? Even I work for someone . Someone else ? Who ? I 've never seen him . No one has ever seen him . I thought you 'd boiled it down to three . I had . I didn 't know about this one . It 's great . You 'll have to call him " d " . We 're here . Are we ? Oh , yes . He likes impressive offices . Good luck . Aren 't you coming ? I must go back . I can 't leave a party so long . People will talk . How will I know him ? He will know you . ( Train passing ) Man : I am glad you could come ... ( Echoing ) : Come ... come ... Where are you ? ... Are you ? ... Are you ? It doesn 't matter ... Matter ... matter ... I want to see you ! I 've been dying to see you ! It won 't make any difference ... Difference ... Difference ... People who hide are afraid ... Afraid ... afraid ... ( Bell tolling ) I didn 't know you existed . It is often the case with really important people . Anonymity is the best disguise . You are afraid . This is very important to me . It is only a commodity . No ... it 's my future . You belong to me now . You were told there is no return . Number six : Not until I know who you are . I 've never liked secrets . Nor have I ! I want to see him ! No one will ever see me . I will . I want to know who I 'm selling out to . We must all know . All ? Aren 't you alone ? No ... But you are . Violence will do no good . It relieves the feelings . Does it matter ? It does to them . We mustn 't disappoint them . The people who are watching . I knew , of course . Now ... show them ! ( Number 74 gasps ) See ? Number 14 : He knew all the time . He was playing with you . Your drug failed ! No . He succeeded . ( Door buzzing ) I owe you an apology . An apology ? Yes . I forgot to give you this . A bargain 's a bargain . Open it , you fool , open it ! I must see what 's in it . He was going on holiday . I wasn 't selling out . That wasn 't the reason I resigned . ( Sighs ) ( Phone beeping ) ( Slam echoes )

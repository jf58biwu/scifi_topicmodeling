 Miguel ! [ Echoing ] Miguel ! [ Echoing ] [ Horse neighing ] [ Neighing ] Miguel . Miguel . Gwangi . No , no . Leave it . He who takes from Gwangi , The evil one , is cursed . Only by an old woman 's tongue . If he does not go back to the forbidden valley , we shall all suffer ! My eyes are blind , but I see the signs ! Keep your superstitions to yourself ! Fool ! Hah ! One day he will learn to obey the law of Gwangi , or , like his brother , he will perish ! [ Band playing ] Howdy , ma 'am . Pasa , señorita . Carry your case , Señor ? Eh , don 't bother me , boy . Don 't you need a guide ? No , I don 't need a guide . - An interpreter ? - No . You need a horse , señor . I don 't need anything . Now get lost , comprende ? There is no money in that , señor . You want to do something ? If there 's money . Tell me where the arena is . Two miles away . Two miles ? You need that horse and a guide . You 're a real hustler , chico .

Ladies and gentlemen , I now have the honor to present The lovely and talented star of our show , Riding wonder horse Omar , Miss T.J. Breckenridge . Well , I 'll be . Hey , Tuck ! Tuck Kirby ! Hi there . [ Circus music ] What in the name of Sam Hill brings you around here ? Up to no good . You don 't seem glad to see me , champ . Like a dying mule seeing a vulture . I 'm no vulture- - bird on the wing , maybe . Flying to the next quick buck . Looks like you finally made it . Yeah , I 'm making out alright . All you care about is yourself . I still care about T.J. You fuss like a mother hen . Her daddy was my friend . Somebody 's got to protect her From guys running out like you . You weren 't sorry I left . Nope . But it nearly broke T.J. ' s heart . I hear you 're not doing so good by her , either . Haven 't been enough customers . We don 't need any big shot Telling us about the show . Why don 't you just go back- - Wait a minute . That 's her tune . That 's the grand finale , right ? Well , I 'm surprised You remembered . Excuse me . I 've got to see this- - For old times ' sake , You understand ? Carlos . [ drum roll ] Hurry up With that ramp . Howdy there , partner . Ex-partner . To what do we owe This unpleasant surprise ? I 'm just Looking around . Trouble comes in threes . I wonder what The next two are . Hey , you can 't Go in there . Get out ! It 's been A long time , T.J. Do you want To get killed ? You 're the one who 's always Trying it out there . Don 't start that . We are going To have a quiet talk , Or you 'll be Across my knee . Fat chance . This is T.J. , Remember ? Sure , i remember . If you don 't mind , I 'd like to change . Well , go on . Go ahead ! You hesitated Before the jump . Seeing you would upset Your own mother . You 're not pulling Much of a crowd , are you ? In villarosa , things Will be better . You sure ? Sure , I 'm sure . Why is that ? What do you care ? You 've got your business . Yep , that 's right . One-man operation . Sitting in a plushy office , Buying and selling acts Instead of getting Knocked off horses . It 's less risk And more pay . So mind your Own business . I 'm doing just that . I 've got a deal to get you Off the hook here . If you 've got a brain , You 'll take it . Thanks . Buffalo bill wants to buy Omar the wonder horse . He 's offering A good price . And you get 10 % , Right ? 20 . You 're not getting one Thin dime out of me . And buffalo bill Is not getting omar . And you can 't come Busting in here Like some hick-town Horse dealer Trying to ruin My show . People depend on me- - Champ , carlos , rowdy . But then you wouldn 't know Anything about loyalty , Would you ? This is business . You play con tricks , and I 'll stick to horse tricks . Now , beat it ! My , my , you always did look Sweet in a temper . Get out i said ! I 've got hotter irons In the fire , honey . Just keep struggling along Leaping off platforms . Go ahead break your neck If you want to . Makes no Difference to me . Good . Just worried About that horse . Wouldn 't want him hurt . Ooh ! Excuse me . Good for you . You should have thrown him Out a long time ago . I say ! Hello there ! Over here , sir . Someone you know ? A client of mine . Professor bromley . What 's he doing Out there ? He digs for old Bones and things . Hello ! Sounds like He 's in trouble . I say , thank heavens You came along . What has happened , Professor ? What has happened ? You know very well What has happened . Rosita ? Rosita , my mule , Refused to budge . Then she kicked me . I don 't know where She 's gone now . Are you hurt ? Well , there are No bones broken , But it 's Frightfully painful . By the way , i don 't Believe we 've met . My name 's bromley . Hi . Name 's Tuck kirby . Hop on . We 'll give you A ride back . Perhaps Lope 's Mount might be A little more Practical . Wait ! Whoa . My boy . [ mule braying ] Come on ! You ought to know better Than to get behind A stubborn mule , professor . Your advice comes A little late , kirby . Look , professor . Rosita Has found her way home ! Vicious beast . Give me your Shoulder , Lope . I 'd say you could use A good stiff drink . You 're right . It 's in the trunk . Lope tells me you 're One of these , uh , One of these Archaeologist fellows . He 's pretty Near the mark . Actually , I 'm a paleontologist . Oh . We dig deeper . It isn 't good To dig up the past . Let sleeping dogs Lie , eh ? We won 't get Very far that way . Depends on where You want to get to . To the bottom of things . What darwin did with His theory of evolution , I intend to do with My theory of humanoids . Humanoids ? It means manlike . Paleontologists Generally believe That man first evolved About a million years ago . I 'll prove it was Many eons before that . If you 'd like to look In that trunk , You 'll find A piece of rock . Will you get it ? That 's it ? Now look At the fossil , The impression Left in the rock . Looks like A footprint . Precisely . It 's an eohippus ! 50- - . Eohippus . The so-called dawn horse- - The ancestor of our Present day horses . I never saw a horse Small enough To leave a print like that . You notice it had Three toes ? Through evolution , Horses have grown larger . That center toe Has become the hoof . ¡ increible ! si , increible . What is more incredible Is the fossil beside it . I 'm convinced that is the tibia Of some humanoid That existed at the same time As the eohippus , Possibly more than 50 million years ago . You found this thing Around here ? In the foothills . This is my whole life , Mr. Kirby , But i need time And money . My resources , Both financial and physical , Are running Precariously low . Well , professor , What you need Is a good rest . Yes , mr . Kirby . Thank you For your kindness . Lope . I 'll bet you didn 't know That was your Middle toe , did you ? T.j. Yeah ? Can i speak to you A moment ? Of course . In private . I know . You want that money I owe you . Don 't worry . We 'll pack them in with Our new attraction . El diablo Will be successful . Shh . Quiet . It 's not only money . What else ? Us together . You and me and diablo- - Let 's see How it goes . Hiyah ! ¡ toro ! Ha ha ha ! Hiyah ! ¡ toro ! Hi there , hon ! I thought I told you to go . About that deal . So go ! I guess you 've been Thinking about it . Nothing is further from My mind , except you . Hey , toro ! Hey , toro ! Hey , toro ! Lope ! Hey , toro ! Hey , hey , toro ! Tuck ! Darling , Are you alright ? Cut it out , Tuck , If you want To get repaired . It 's not easy To keep still With you hanging Around me like that . Who was that fellow Who jumped the bull ? Oh , carlos . I 'm glad He was there . He saved your life . Why did you walk Out on me , Tuck ? I was ready To sell out , To marry you . That 's all I ever wanted . I don 't know . I didn 't want to . Getting married Is like being a horse Tied up in a corral . I never could take Being all roped up . T.j. , you know what ? I just know you 're Going to sell me omar . Hmm ? That 's right . You 've Got a deal . Wait a minute . What 's going on ? Nothing . Anything For you , baby . Don 't give me That baby stuff . Carlos brought me A new act . What kind ? Come to the opening At villarosa . No , no , i mean now . Alright . I 'll Show you tonight . But first , The patient must rest , Or he might Have a relapse , And relapses Can be fatal . T.j. , i- - Now lie still . Doesn 't it hurt To move ? Terrible . [ music box playing ] Meet el diablo . [ horse whinnies ] Well , if that don 't Beat all . You want a little Sugar , don 't you ? [ whinny ] Where 'd you ever Get this critter ? Carlos found him . He must have been In a gold mine . It took a while To train him , But he 's ready To debut . What 's the act ? We strap a platform Onto omar 's back . El diablo Waltzes on top . A horse dancing On horseback . That 's got to be A humdinger . I can see It all now . Presenting el diablo , The world 's one and Only miniature horse . We are on our way To a fortune . Amazing . It 's absolutely astounding . It was those three toes That started me thinking . And four On its hind feet . Great scott , It could be- - An eo--what 's it ? Hippus . Eohippus , yes . Eohippus , If you are one ... What are you doing here Over 50 million years After you Should be extinct ? It could be A freak of nature . Is there any way To tell ? By checking its origin . If i could prove This is the genuine article , I shall receive A knighthood For the greatest scientific Discovery of the age . The greatest scientific Discovery of the age ? T.j. Doesn 't know What she 's got . Sir horace bromley . It 'll look great In lights . Buffalo bill , Barnum bailey . Galileo , newton , And bromley ... Or the ringling Brothers- - We 'll play one off Against the other , Sell to the highest Bidder . Possibly lord bromley . We 'd make a killing . We must find out where this Little horse came from . Let 's find This guy carlos . Impossible . My dear fellow , I have no Commercial interest In el diablo . I 'm a scientist . I don 't care What you are . T.j. Has given away Our secret , Destroying All my dreams . Be reasonable . My people do not Understand reason . That witch tia zorina Speaks nonsense About el diablo . They believe it . You could show us The camp . You 've caused enough Trouble already . Well , thanks For your help , carlos . What help ? Tia zorina . Camp . We can sure Find that camp . How ? Why , Lope . Lope ? Sure . That kid Could find A needle in a haystack And sell it For a profit . ¡ ole ! ¡ ole ! ¡ ole ! Madam , i am prepared to pay A guide handsomely . To lead you to the Forbidden valley ? No ! Not for all the gold In the world . What forbidden Valley ? From there came The little horse . And until He is returned , A great evil Will fall upon us . Rubbish ! Unless the horse Is returned , We shall all suffer The curse of hell . Superstitious claptrap . There 's nothing hocus-pocus About that little horse . Don 't you realize We 've discovered A living specimen Of the eohippus ? You mean that thing Really is an eohippus ? Of course . Well , naturally we shall Have to prove it By scientific research . Well , We aren 't getting Any scientific Research done here , Are we , professor ? Uh , if you can 't help me , Perhaps i can help you . If you knew where The little horse was hidden , What would you do ? Return it To the forbidden valley . Well ... A centavo for your Thoughts , señor . Oh , hiya , Lope . limonada , por favor . You look unhappy , señor . I 've got A problem , Lope . I 've been wrestling With it for hours . Sometimes it helps To tell an amigo . Well , it 's like This , amigo . I made a big discovery Last night , And if i tell This friend about it , She could make A fortune . But if she Makes a fortune , It might not help me . I can 't figure Why I 'm helping her Make a fortune When i could just Be quiet And make a fortune Myself . Savvy ? I savvy very well . I can 't understand it . Love . Love 's for latins . My mama used to tell me , " when you help Someone you love , You help yourself . " here . Limonada . For free advice . muchas gracias . de nada . You sure know how To help yourself , Lope . What 's the big Discovery , señor ? No , no . You 'll want a cut . Why ? I 'm doing fine alone . I see . Widening Your horizons . Sorry , señor ? You 're going On a journey . With the professor . With the professor ? I must meet him tonight , With the mule , Outside the arena . Well , that 's it , amigo . No more figuring . I think my friend Needs help right now . Ha ha ha ! [ neighing ] [ neigh ] ah . Si , si , si . ¡ vamos ! Come on , come on . Aie . Hey , Tuck ! Tuck , what 's the hurry ? Lope , come here . We are in luck , chico . They 've got it . Kirby , let them go ! Don 't be a fool , man ! Come on . We mustn 't lose them . What happened ? He hit me . Who ? Your friend kirby . What ? I caught him and others Stealing el diablo . Stealing ? Why , The dirty ... No , not Tuck . We just saw him With our own eyes . He 's no good , T.J. Champ , Get bean and rowdy . You bet . Whoa ! Look here . Tuck 's got company . We 're headed In the right direction . He 's working With the professor . He was speaking Of scientific interests . Tuck wants el diablo For buffalo bill . You should have Listened to me . He 's right , T.J. That Tuck Is the lowest . All right , all right . He was right . I was wrong . If we stand here , We 'll never catch him . I know where They 're heading . There 's a shortcut To forbidden valley . [ mule braying ] [ mule braying ] Help ! Professor , where Is that little horse ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? Alright , sir horace , When your king finds out You 're a horse thief , He 'll sure give you A touch of the sword ... There ! Tell me where El diablo is . You can make it easy Or hard on yourself . The gypsies took him . You put them up to it ! Yes , in a way , but It will benefit us all . Now , is that a fact ? El diablo- - Is the property Of T.J. Breckenridge ! I 'm protecting her interests . Well , so am i . Don 't you see ? We must follow The gypsy trail To the forbidden Valley Because where There 's one eohippus , There must be others . At least two , The sire and the mare , Possibly more . Just think what you And Miss breckenridge Could do With a dozen eohippi . From now on , We 're partners ? Oh , no , professor . As a rule , I never shake hands With an anxious man . I 'll join you , But no deals . Senor kirby ! Hey . Hi there , Lope . Say , what 's the price Of water around here ? One peso . To you , half . O kay . [ whinnies ] Fly , little one . Fly home to your master . [ whinnies ] [ whinnies ] This circle of mountains , Jagged peaks , steep cliffs ... Could be The perfect barrier Against man And the elements . No wonder they call it The forbidden valley . Yes . Might be the answer To many things . Like what ? We shall soon see , Mr. Kirby . We 'll camp here And start out first thing In the morning . [ screeching ] What 's that ? [ screeching ] Quick ! The horses ! Where 's rosita ? Senor kirby . Professor . Look . There 's blood All around . Whoa ! Whoa . Yeah , the gypsies Stopped here , And el diablo Ran off that way . Senor kirby ! Professor ! [ music box playing ] Now , how 'd They get here ? I was afraid Of something like this . Hey ! Champ , i caught myself A horse thief . You don 't think i had Anything to do with that ? Look ! The eohippus ! Easy , easy . Stay . [ music box playing ] That 's no good . Let 's chase him On horseback . Go get him . Hey , you need any help ? Not from you . Oh ! I 've got it ! Take your thieving Hands off him . He 's mine .

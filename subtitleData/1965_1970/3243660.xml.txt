Well ... what sort were these then , Montag ? I didn 't really look , sir . A little bit of everything . - Ovels , biographies , adventure stories . - Oh , routine , eh ? Why will they do it ? It 's sheer perversity . - By the way ... - Pass it over . What does Montag do with his day off duty ? Ot very much , sir . Mow the lawn . And what if the law forbids that ? Just watch it grow , sir . Uh-huh . Good . Good . Montag might be hearing some exciting news in a day or two . Benedict won 't be with us very much longer ... - and Montag 's name has been mentioned . - Promotion , sir ? - I trust that the thought makes Montag happy . I think we 're neighbours . I live near block 813 . - Isn 't that where you live ? - Yes , I do . Do you know we make the same trip together almost every day ? - Do we ? - Hmm . That 's why I thought to myself ... well , we ought to talk to each other . Do you mind ? Me talking , I mean . O , no , go ahead . Talk . I can 't promise to think of anything to answer though . Don 't worry about that . Once I get started , nothing can stop me . My uncle says I am a veritable well of words . Has this uncle of yours ever warned you never to speak to strangers ? O. He did say once if anyone asked how old I was ... to say I was 20 years old and light in the head . - They always go together . - " Light in the head " ? Mmm . Loopy . Crazy . Anyway , you don 't frighten me . - Why should I ? - O reason really . The uniform , I suppose . Most people are ... frightened ... - frightened of firemen . - This is my stop now . Mine too . - Are you an officer ? - Oh , no . Ot yet . An officer has to ... I 'm going to be promoted soon . Even with my eyes closed , I could tell what you do for a job . - Because of the smell of kerosene ? - Huh . Quite a scent , isn 't it ? My wife doesn 't like it very much . She says it lingers . I don 't mind . I think of it as a ... perfume . - Perfume ? - Yes , a perfume , like any other . I don 't think I 've seen your wife . What 's she like ? She 's rather like you , except her hair is long . - Rather like me ? - Quite like you . Tell me , that number you all wear , what 's it mean ? Oh , Fahrenheit 451 . Why 451 rather than 813 or 121 ? Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which ... book paper catches fire and starts to burn . I 'd like to ask you something else , only I don 't really dare . Go ahead . Is it true ... that a long time ago ... - firemen used to put out fires and not burn books ? Really , your uncle is right . You are light in the head . " Put fires out " ? Who told you that ? - I don 't know . Someone . But is it true ? - What a strange idea . - Houses have always been fireproof . - Ours isn 't . Well , then , it should be condemned one of these days . It has to be destroyed , and you will have to move ... to a house that is fireproof . Too bad . Tell me , why do you burn books ? What ? Well , it 's a job like any other . Good work with lots of variety . Monday , we burn Miller ; , Tuesday , Tolstoy ; Wednesday , Walt Whitman ; Friday , Faulkner ; , and Saturday and Sunday , Schopenhauer and Satre . " We burn them to ashes and then burn the ashes . " - That 's our official motto . - You don 't like books then ? - Do you like the rain ? - Yes , I adore it . Books are just so much ... rubbish . They have no interest . Then why do some people still read them although it 's so dangerous ? Precisely because it is forbidden . Why is it forbidden ? Because it makes people unhappy . Do you really believe that ? Oh , yes . Books disturb people . They make them antisocial . Do you think I 'm antisocial ? Why do you ask ? Well ... I 'm a teacher . Well , not quite . I 'm still on probation . This afternoon the analyst called me in ... and I don 't think I said the right things . I 'm not at all happy about my answers . That 's probably why I 've been so rude to you . Have I been annoying you ? Oh , no , not at all . - In fact , I was questioned this afternoon as well . I didn 't do too well either . This is where I live . You see ? This is my house . - One more question . - Another one ? - Just a tiny one . - What is it ? Do you ever read the books you burn ? Why should I ? First , I 'm not interested . Second , I 've better things to do . Third , it is forbidden . Of course . - You happy ? - What ? Of course I 'm happy . ... so you can protect yourself on the streets . The art of self-defence , and of attack on occasions ... may also come in handy in the home , cousins . If you watch carefully , you will see ... how a woman can use a man 's superior weight to her own advantage . Did you see that ? Now let 's watch that once again normally . And now in slow motion . Watch it carefully again , cousins . I 'm going to be promoted . - As he starts to advance , notice her position : - Are you listening , Linda ? Knees bent slightly and toes turned slightly inwards . Oh , that 's marvellous , Montag . There . Now you see how easily she has disposed of her ... The captain told me while we were out on a call . What did you say ? I 'm talking about my promotion . Does that mean an increase , dear ? - How much ? - He didn 't mention that . We could move to a larger house . Would you like that ? I 'd rather have a second wall-set put in . They say when you have your second wall-screen ... - it 's like having your family grow around you . Linda , how many of these pills have you taken today ? What 's that ? Oh , those . Help yourself . I 've got another bottle . - How many have you had ? - Oh , don 't carry on like that . Only a few . Anyway , tonight 's special for me . I 've got a part in The Family . - What ? - Our campaign against the enemies of the public peace ... is gaining momentum . Today 's figures for operations in the urban area alone ... account for the elimination of the total ... of 2,750 pounds of conventional editions . Eight hundred and thirty-six pounds of first editions ... and 17 pounds of manuscripts were also destroyed . Twenty-three antisocial elements were detained , pending re-education . Did you see that ? Cousin Claudette 's got a bouffant tonight . - Who ? - Cousin Claudette . - Who is Cousin Claudette ? - The cousin announcer . The one you don 't like . I don 't like any of them . Why don 't you get the kitchen family fixed ? You are awful . - Oh , hurry , hurry ! I 'll be on in a minute ! Quickly ! Quickly ! - I don 't understand . How can you be in a play ? They 've written a play with one part missing . That 's me . When the people look at me , then I have to speak . They ask me a question , and I have to say what I think . - The play , it 's beginning . - And now , for cousins everywhere ... Our Family Theatre . " Come Play With Us . " Aturally , in what you are about to see ... any similarity with the truth or with real life will be purely coincidental . Do bear that in mind . So , will you come play with us ? You will ? Good ! I thought you would . Come in , cousins . Be one of the family . Charles , do you realize what a dilemma this is ? It 's terribly difficult . I don 't see any way out of it . Come , come , Bernard . Of course there 's a way out . There are 13 of us so far , right ? You want to invite Edward , which makes 14 . But if somebody 's ill , then we should be back to 13 again . - Precisely . Then we must invite more people . - That 's an idea . What about Lottie and James ? That 'll make 16 . Then if somebody 's ill , at least we won 't be 13 . But then there 's the problem of the rooms . Lottie has two little boys : Freddie and little John . I don 't see any problem there at all . We can put the two children in Helen 's room . What do you think , Linda ? - Go ahead . They 're waiting for you . - I think that ... You see ? Linda agrees with me . Lottie 's children must go in with Helen 's children . Linda 's absolutely right . Then there 's the problem of the seating , Charles . I think I 've got something worked out , though . Look . If we put Yvonne at the head and Richard at her right ... Oh , no , Bernard . Richard isn 't even speaking to Yvonne . - Oh ? - Because of Leslie . - Oh ! - Madeleine must be at the head . Besides , Madeleine is older than Yvonne . She might even be older than Jacqueline . I see no problem there . We put Madeleine at the head of the table . It 's Madeleine , isn 't it , Linda ? Absolutely . - If Linda thinks it 's all right , it must be . - There 's still the problem about the rooms . - What rooms are left ? There 's the pink room . We could always put Lilian in the pink room . - We can put Susan in the green room . - Yes . - Where can we put Monica ? - Yes , what can we do with Monica ? Do you have the answer , Linda ? In the blue room ? Linda , you 're right . She 's right . Linda , you 're absolutely fantastic . You saw it , didn 't you ? I gave all the right answers . Wasn 't it wonderful ? I could have been an actress . Don 't you think so ? - Think what ? - That I could have been an actress . Oh , sure you could have been an actress . I wonder whether Joyce was watching . I do hope so . I must ring her tomorrow and find out what she thought . - How did you get the part ? - The head of The Family rang me up . Me ! And said I was to be in tonight 's play . Linda , they must have phoned every one of 200,000 Lindas in the whole country . That 's not true . I mean , even if it were true , you didn 't have to tell me . That was very mean . So you 're in for promotion , Montag . Good luck . Thank you . Well , well , what 's all this we hear , Montag ? Promotion , eh ? It seems so . How do you feel about it ? Happy ? - The wife rather likes the idea . - I suppose . - Hurry ! Attention ! That will do for today . Go back to your desks . What 's this ? I told you two I did not want to see you sitting next to each other . Didn 't I make it clear enough the first time ? Yes , you ! You know what I mean . Come and sit here . Let us review yesterday 's lesson . We studied how to detect books hidden during the actual construction of a house . This is somewhat rare because it 's very costly ; for its floors , for its ceilings . We also studied concealment inside furniture . Trainee firemen Stoneman and Black are to report to Captain 's office immediately . I repeat , trainee firemen Stoneman and Black ... are to report to the captain 's office immediately . We were discussing concealment inside furniture . The most prevalent form being the false icebox or the fake television set . What occasionally presents problems are books hidden in small quantities ... in everyday objects . When one is looking for a book , the most common area is to look for it ... in a rectangular object , like a cigar box or a chocolate box ... or any other object in similar shape . I demonstrate how even a cylindrical object can be used . Montag will report to the captain 's office . Here , you . Hand me a pile of books . While I 'm gone , give each of the trainees a book . Each of you will hide his book somewhere in this classroom . When I return , I will give you a demonstration how to search . To learn how to find , one must first know how to hide . - What shall I say ? - We met by accident . - That 's no good . - What do you want to say ? - We planned it ? - It was your idea . - You 're the one who thought of it . - Shut up ! If we don 't tell him the same story , we 're ... Listen ... let 's play this by ear . - Montag , this will take about five minutes . - Yes , sir . What time is it ? Uh ... 10 : 00 , sir . Get out ! This is the last time ! Get out ! - Like gymnastics , Montag ? - Yes , sir . - And what about hockey ? Do you like hockey ? - Yes , I do , sir . - And golf ? - Golf . Very much , sir . - Hmm ? And football ? - Wonderful , sir . Billiards ? Basketball ? Oh , they 're all very fine sports , sir . Then increase the dosage . More sports for everyone , hmm ? Strengthen the group spirit . Organize the fun . Hmm ? Just keep them busy , and you keep them happy . That 's what matters . Hmm ? Am I right ? Absolutely , sir . Well , shall we talk a little about this promotion of yours ? You have mentioned the possibility to your wife ? - Yes , sir . - And her reaction ? She thought we might be able to have a second wall-screen . Oh , you only have the one wall converted . I see . These matters of promotion are much more important to a married man , aren 't they ? I guess so , sir . Montag ... you have no children , I believe . O , sir . We have no children . Well , then , a commission seems in order . I can 't see any reason offhand why it shouldn 't go through . You understand , of course ... with the new amendment to the law , we must expect to be worked really very hard . Very hard , indeed ... until we can arrange for new volunteers to be drafted . Yes , sir , I heard the men talking about it . How long have you been with us ? For six years , sir . Yes , for six years . No , no , no , for five years , sir . For five years . Montag has one quality I appreciate greatly . He says very little . Have you seen my personal medallion ? It 's a remarkable likeness . You must remind me to let you have one sometime . Ow , let 's get back to this promotion of yours . I 've been looking through your file . There are only six back views . We need 12 of them , you know . Two sets of six . Remember that , Montag . Linda ? Linda ! Hospital listening . - Yes , it 's about my wife . She ... - ame and address . Uh ... Montag . Block 813 . - 813 ? - Uh , just a moment . - Hello ? I just came home from work , - Yes . - And I found her on the floor unconscious . - Does she take pills ? - Of course ! Yesterday , she ... - Just a moment . - I 'll connect you with poisoning section . - Yes . - Poisoning listening . - It 's about my wife . She ... - ame and address . - Uh , Montag . Block 813 . - What kind of pills ? - Oh ... uh , just a moment . - Hello ? - Yes ? They are red . Oh , and red number two . Oh , it 's a stimulant . It 's harmless . She 's probably taken the wrong kind of sedative on top of that . Oh , just a moment . - Hello ? - Yes , listening . Oh , yes , they are golden number eight . Right . Stay close to her . The ambulance is on its way . - Four minutes . - What should I do in the meantime ? Othing . Where is the doctor ? - What doctor ? - The doctor to take care of my wife . O doctors on these jobs . We do all the blood jobs , me and him . - O , it 's here , please . - That 's right , us . Who did you expect ? Cases like that ... We handle 50 a day like her . That 's right . She won 't be the last tonight , not by a long shot . O , sir . Don 't you worry , sir . We 'll give her a pump out and fill her up with new blood . In 20 minutes , she 'll be as good as new . Just you relax . This isn 't pretty to look at . You need a strong stomach . You better wait out there . You just leave it all to us . We 'll call you as soon as she 's done . This regulator is not as regular as it was . Come here with that thing . First , get the stockings off . - Never mind that . Put the dress on that chair . All right , sir , you can come in now . She 's fresh as a daisy , good as gold . - She 's still unconscious . - I wouldn 't say that , sir . You 've got it wrong . She 's asleep . Ever mind about her . You get to bed . By tomorrow , it 'll all be forgotten . She 'll be completely well by tomorrow ? Better than that . Take my word for it , she 'll be on top of the world . - She 'll have an appetite for all sorts of things . That 's right . She 'll be starving . You 'll find out . My , I 'm hungry . How do you feel ? Hungry . Really hungry . - I 'm absolutely starving . I could eat a horse . - Do you remember last night ? - Yes , what a sleep . I slept like a log . - Listen ... - when I came home last night , you were ... - I 'm absolutely famished . Let me talk , Linda , will you ? Oh ... of course , darling . Talk all you like if it makes you happy . Go on then . What about last night ? Othing . I can 't remember . It doesn 't matter anyway . Look . I 've bought you a present to celebrate your ... Oh , I forget what . Ever mind . Do you like it ? Isn 't it lovely ? - Do you like it ? - Yes , I do . Very much . Isn 't it smart ? It 's the very latest . Everyone 's using them now . Can I throw your old one away ? Linda . Linda . I 've something to tell you . Are you listening , Linda ? What are you doing ? Linda ? Hey ! Do you ever read the books you burn ? Hey , you , come here . Come here . Here . What 's all this ? What is it ? Eh ? Hey ! Come on . Come on . Come on . All right . Hold him . But some boys still boycott the barber shops . Here you see a mop-up squad at work on one of these messy know-it-alls . It all goes to show law enforcement can be fun . How come the door is not working ? You 're just in time . Dinner is nearly ready . - Montag , what are you doing ? - I 'm coming . " The Personal History of David Copperfield ... " by Charles Dickens ... " with 40 illustrations by Phiz . " London , Chapman and Hall , Limited , and Humphrey Milford . " Ew York , Oxford University Press ... " the American Branch . " 35 West 32nd Street . " David Copperfield . " Chapter one . " I am born . " Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life ... " or whether that station will be held by anybody else ... " these pages must show . " To begin my life with the beginning of my life ... " I record that I was born ... " on a Friday , at twelve o 'clock at night . " It was remarked that the clock began to strike ... and I began to cry , simultaneously . " Simultaneously . Just a moment . Go on . Come on . Aha . Ah-ah . - Oh ! Everything all right ? - Yes , everything 's all right . That 's what they always say , so it must be ... all right . It certainly doesn 't look that way . What 's wrong ? Oh , everything . It would take too long to ... Sometimes I can 't stand it any more . I 'd just like to ... - All right , let 's go somewhere quiet then . - Won 't you be late ? - O , I have plenty of time . Let 's go over here . I saw you the other day , when we were going out on a call . I was on the fire engine . You know , it 's funny . It reminded me of something . A girl who used to wait ... for a soldier ... by a barrack gate . - What 's happened ? - You remember the analyst , how worried I was ? - Mm-hmm . - I was right to be worried . I 've been dismissed . Why ? What reason did they give ? One at all . Just an official call . Services no longer required . I 'm never to go to the school any more . They must give you a reason . Make them tell you why . Go to the school and ask . I can 't do that . Anyway , who knows what they may have said about me to the children . Strange . I wonder what you said that made the analyst ... Don 't you have any idea ? Something you said or did ? I never did get on well with the staff . They disapprove of me . I don 't always stick to the timetable and ... we have fun in my classes , and they don 't like that . There was another teacher , the one I replaced . The same thing happened to her . They didn 't like her either . - Ow she 's in some awful kind of trouble . - Then it wasn 't the analyst . It was the staff that wanted to get rid of you because you are different . Look at that fellow over there . - What 's he doing ? - That 's the information box . - He can 't make up his mind . - What 's he want to find out ? He doesn 't want to find out anything . He knows someone who has books . So he got hold of that person 's picture and number ... and is going to drop it into that box . - But he 's an informer ! - O , he 's an informant . Look at him . Like someone circling around a woman . - He 's putting something in his mouth . - It 's a stimulant ... to work up his nerve . He wants to make sure no one can see him . Look at him . He 's walking away . You see ? He couldn 't go through with it . Don 't worry , he 'll be back . Here he comes . Good Lord , make up your mind . - There . What a relief . - Now he 's got rid of his noisy neighbour ... or his brother-in-law who has got a better job or even his mother . Why not ? It 's time to work . Please , go back to the school and try to find out . O , I can 't do that . You must find an excuse to go back there . Suppose I ought to go and clear out my locker . That 's all right . Uh , I have to hurry . Good luck . I 'm not going . You must come with me . But I can 't . I have to go to work . I 'll take care of that . Come on . Leave it to me . The Rodier Firehouse . Extension one , miss . Rodier Firehouse listening . - Can I speak to ... - Who 's calling ? - I 'm speaking for Montag . - Yes ? - Can I speak to the captain ? - One moment . - Captain listening . - This is Linda Montag . - Montag 's wife ? - Yes . - What can I do for you ? - My husband asked me to tell you ... he 's been taken ill and can 't leave his bed . - Nothing serious , I hope . - No , he should be up by this evening . - Very well , madam . Thank you for informing me . - Thank you . Montag 's wife . He 's not too well . He 's staying in bed . Montag ? Mmm . Is he ? I see . Well , Fabian , that 'll do for now . Until the meeting . Okay . Nine thirteens are a hundred and seventeen . Nine fourteens are a hundred and twenty-six . Nine fifteens are a hundred and thirty-five . Nine sixteens are a hundred and forty-four . Nine seventeens are a hundred and fifty-three . - That 's Robert . - Nine eighteens are a hundred and sixty-two . Nine nineteens are a hundred and seventy-one . Robert . Nine thirteens are a hundred and seventeen . - It may be my uniform . - Yes , yes , that 's what frightened him ! - It must have been your uniform . - Go ahead . I 'll wait here . - Nine fifteens are a hundred and thirty-five . - All right . - Nine sixteens are a hundred and forty-four . - Nine seventeens are a hundred and fifty-three . - Nine eighteens are a hundred and sixty-three . One twelve is twelve . Two twelves is twenty-four . Three twelves is thirty-six . Four twelves is forty-eight . Five twelves is sixty . - Six twelves is seventy-two . Seven twelves is eighty-four . Eight twelves is ninety-six . Nine twelves is a hundred and eight . Ten twelves is a hundred and twenty . Eleven twelves is a hundred and thirty-two . Twelve twelves ... I 'm going to be promoted . They 'll listen to me then . - I 'll go and see your principal myself . Come . - Why ? - What ? How did it come about ? What made it begin ? What made you want to do ... How could someone like you be doing this kind of work ? I know everyone says that . But you ! You 're not like them . When I say something to you , you look at me . Why did you choose this job ? For you it doesn 't seem to make any sense . Do you remember what you asked me the other day ? - If I ever read the books I burn ? Remember ? - Mm-hmm . Last night I read one . " Because I 'd be ashamed of myself . " Ashamed of myself . " It was a little after half past 11 : 00 . " - What are you doing , Linda ? - I found these things in the house . I don 't want these things . They frighten me . You spend your whole life in front of that " family " on the wall . These books are my family . When did we first meet ? And where ? - What ? - When did we meet for the first time ? I don 't know . Let me think . O , I really can 't remember . Oh , that 's rather sad . Don 't you think ? I do . I think it 's very sad . Behind each of these books , there 's a man . That 's what interests me . So leave them alone and go back to bed . - I can 't sleep . - You have your pills , haven 't you ? " Rhinoceros : " Any of certain large , powerful ... " thick-skinned perissodactyl mammals ... " of the family ... Rhinocerotidae . " - Well , look who 's here . - What about it ? - I thought you were on sick leave . - Sick leave ? - Who gave you that idea ? - I don 't remember . I must have got it wrong . Hurry up . Montag , you 've forgotten your helmet . What 's this , Montag ? Something wrong between you and the pole ? Oh , Mummy , look ! Firemen . Mummy , there 's going to be a fire . " Play the man , Master Ridley . " We shall this day light such a candle , by God 's grace ... as I trust shall never be put out . " The police haven 't done their job very well . Who is this woman ? - What is she doing here ? - Well , she 's certainly worth looking at anyway . Police arrested the family this morning , sir . She must have been out . - Where are the books ? - If you didn 't know that , you wouldn 't be here . Upstairs . Montag , you stay here . Hey ! You two , in there ! In there . Go on . Down there ! Throw them all down ! Break it open ! That 's it . This way ! Come on ! Down there ! Throw them all down ! All the books ! All of them ! This way ! Come on ! " Once upon a time , there was a poor woodcutter whose name was ... " They can 't have my books . They 'll never take them away . - Montag , I think you should see this . - Yes , sir . Come on ! Quickly ! This is a real eyeful . Ah , Montag . I knew it . I knew it . Of course , all this ... The existence of a secret ... library was known in high places ... but there was no way of getting at it . Only once before have I seen so many books in one place . I was just an ordinary fireman at the time . I wasn 't even qualified to use the flamethrower . It 's all ours , Montag . Listen to me , Montag . Once to each fireman , at least once in his career ... he just itches to know what these books are all about . He just aches to know . Isn 't that so ? Take my word for it , Montag , there 's nothing there . The books have nothing to say ! Look , these are all novels . All about people that never existed . The people that read them , it makes them unhappy with their own lives ... makes them want to live in other ways that can never really be . What 's happening ? This house is condemned . They said to burn the books here with everything else . Burning the house is one thing . Burning the books is another , isn 't it ? It 's never any good burning everything together . Come on , Montag . All this philosophy , let 's get rid of it . It 's even worse than the novels . Thinkers , philosophers , all of them saying exactly the same thing : " Only I am right . The others are all idiots . " One century , they tell you man 's destiny is predetermined . The next , they say that he has freedom of choice . It 's just a matter of fashion , that 's all . Philosophy . Just like short dresses this year , long dresses next year . Look . All stories of the dead . Biography that 's called . And autobiography . My Life . My Diary . My Memoirs . My Intimate Memoirs . Of course , when they started out , it was just the urge to write . Then after the second or third book , all they wanted was to satisfy their own vanity ... to stand out from the crowd , to be different ... to be able to look down on all the others . Ah , Critic 's Prize . This is a good one . Of course , he had the critics on his side . Lucky fellow . Just tell me this , Montag , at a guess ... how many literary awards were made in this country , on an average each year ? Five , ten , forty ? Hmm ? No less than 1,200 . Anybody that put pen to paper was bound to win some prize someday . Ah , Robinson Crusoe . The negroes didn 't like that because of his man , Friday . And ietzsche . Ah , ietzsche . The Jews didn 't like ietzsche . Ow , here 's a book about lung cancer . All the cigarette smokers got into a panic , so for everybody 's peace of mind , we burn it . Ah , now this one must be very profound . The Ethics of Aristotle . Ow anybody that read that must believe he 's a cut above anybody that hadn 't . You see , it 's no good , Montag . We 've all got to be alike . The only way to be happy is for everyone to be made equal . So , we must burn the books , Montag . - All the books . - Sir . - Yes , what 's the matter ? - Trouble with the old lady downstairs . She won 't leave . She won 't leave her books , she says . She won 't leave her books , won 't she ? Won 't she ? Come on now , madam . We 're gonna burn the house . - O. - What do you want ? Martyrdom ? - I want to die as I 've lived . - Oh , you must have read that in there . I 'm not going to ask you again . Are you going ? These books were alive . They spoke to me . Go ahead . All right , that 's enough . Come on , madam , you 've got ten seconds . Fabian , ten count . One . Two . Three . Four . Five . Six . Seven . Eight . - Ine . - Ine elevens are ninety-nine . Ine twelves are a hundred and eight . - Nine thirteens are a hundred and seventeen . - She can 't stay here . - She refuses to leave . Look out . - She must be forced to leave . Back there ! Open up ! Everybody , outside ! Come on , you too , Montag ! Montag ! Get out of there ! Montag ! Come on , this way ! Montag ! Montag ! Finally , do remember to tolerate your friends ' friends ... however alien and peculiar they may seem to you . - Don 't despise minorities . - Doesn 't Cousin Midge 's face look swollen ? - That 's because she 's pregnant . - Is that why ? - I think it 's irresponsible to have children . Somebody 's got to have children , Jackie . They can 't let the race die out . Babies grow up to look like you . That must be fun . - Strangle violence . Suppress prejudice . - Here 's Montag . Be tolerant today . Remember : Being just pretty is not enough . The wife who uses translusives knows better than that . Try some today , but watch out for your friends 'husbands . They 'll be around you like flies . No one will ever notice that your chairs don 't match ... and you 'll be as popular as ever . Would you excuse me ? Yes , I like her hair like this . Come on , Montag , be good now . Come on over and sit with us . You haven 't seen Jackie and Doris and Helen for ages . - It 's very rude , you know . - Leave me alone . Aren 't you well ? All right , but it 's very naughty . ... are being reclassified . Two cells of antisocials were located earlier today ... in the western metropolitan area . The police have declined to comment so far . Meanwhile , the " Report Those Who Threaten You " campaign ... - met with particular success today ... - When an old woman , cousins ... chose to be burned with her books rather than being separated from them . If that 's a joke , it 's not in very good taste . - You would like to think that , wouldn 't you ? - Don 't be silly , Montag . Things like that don 't happen . You mean , you don 't want to hear about it . I saw it ! - My husband says ... - Oh , your husband ! You don 't even know where he is ! - Montag ! - Of course I know . - He 's been called on reserve for some field training . - Or to fight a little war . - You never know , do you ? - Why do you call it that ? Even if he was , what about it ? He 's not allowed to call me until it 's all over . - It 'll only be about a week or two . - He 'll be all right . The point about wars is , if you want to call them that ... - it 's only other women 's husbands who get killed . - That 's true . I never knew anyone who got killed in a ... ot anyone whose husband died like that . Getting run over , jumping out of a window , yes . Like Gloria 's husband a few nights ago . But never that other way . Anyway , that 's life , isn 't it ? That 's what you call it . You 're nothing but zombies , all of you . Just like those husbands of yours you don 't even know any more . You 're not living , you 're just killing time ! - Well , I think it 's time to go . - Yes , I ... Thank you . It was a lovely afternoon . - Really fun . - Yes . - Sit down ! - Come on , sit down . It 'll only take a minute . - Whatever is that ? - Darling . - It 's not a book ? That 's what it is . It 's a novel . Oh , it 's a book ! Oh , you mustn 't ! It 's against the law ! - Quiet . Sit down and listen . - Since Montag really insists . But when he 's through , I hope we can do as we please . " There can be no disparity in marriage ... " like unsuitability of mind and purpose . " I had endeavoured to adapt Dora to myself and found it impracticable . " It remained for me to adapt myself to Dora , to share with her what I could and be happy . " It made my second year much happier than my first ... " and , what was better still , made Dora 's life all sunshine . " But as that year wore on , Dora was not strong . " I had hoped that lighter hands than mine would help to mould her character ... " and that a baby 's smile upon her breast might change my child-wife to a woman . " It was not to be . My pretty Dora . " We thought she would be running about as she used to do in a few days . " But they said wait a few days more , and then wait a few days more ... " and still she neither ran nor walked . " I began to carry her downstairs every morning and upstairs every night . " But sometimes when I took her up , I felt that she was lighter in my arms . " A dead , blank feeling came upon me ... " as if I were approaching some frozen region ... " yet unseen that numbed my life . " I avoided direct recognition of this feeling by any name , over any communing with myself . - " Until one night when it was very strong upon me ... " And my aunt had left her with her parting cry ... " ' Oh , goodbye , little blossom . ' - " I sat down at my desk , alone , and tried to think . " Oh , what a fatal name it was . " And how the blossom ... withered in its bloom up in the tree . " I knew that 's what would happen . It 's what I 've always said . Life isn 't like novels , novels and tears , novels and suicide . Ovels are sick . That was sheer cruelty , Montag . - You 're a cruel man . - All those words ; idiotic words . Evil words that hurt people . Isn 't there enough trouble as it is ? - Why disturb people with that sort of filth ? - Poor Doris . Bye , Linda . We were having such a nice party . - Such a shame . - I can 't bear to know those feelings . I 'd forgotten all about those things . Oh , I 'm sorry , Doris . They won 't come back . I 'll be all alone . I won 't be popular any more . They won 't use me in The Family any more . And you made Doris cry ! She cried because it is true . What are you going to do now ? Haven 't you done enough harm ? Leave me alone , Linda . I 've got reading to do . Quite a lot . - What 's the matter with you ? Aren 't you well ? - It 's nothing . I 've got to read . I 've got to catch up with the remembrance of the past ! Right . You four , over to the house ! Take out the line . - This is it . Hurry . Go on ! - But what about you , Uncle ? Don 't worry . Get going ! All right . Take your time . - I 'm coming . - Open up ! Come on ! We know there 's someone in there ! Please , wait a minute . I 'm coming . - Come on ! Open up ! - All right ! I 'm coming ! Come on , come on . - Now , watch it . - You watch it . - What is this ? - I 'm moving this chair . I 'm fed up with it in the middle of the room . And this one ... I 'm going to put ... over here . There . And I 'm going to change those curtains . I 've never liked them . I 'm gonna get new ones . And I 'm gonna change the laundry basket . I 've decided ... You 're right . The chair 's much better over there . You know , you 're not well . You were tossing and turning all night . You kept me awake . You ought to stay home today . O , no , I 'm going to the firehouse . I must . Because I don 't know if I 'm going there tomorrow or any other day . - But what about your promotion ? - My promotion ? That was before . Montag . Look , last night ... you were talking in your sleep . I don 't know what . I didn 't understand . And I don 't understand . What 's making you like this ? What 's going on in your head ? I don 't know , and I don 't want to know . But one thing I do want . I want you to get rid of those books . - Take them away , Montag . Please . - I will . I promise . - I 'll do it myself if you like . - O , I 'll do it ... after I 've read them . O , now . Do it right now , Montag . I 'll leave you . I can 't live with those . You 've got to make a choice . Answer me , Montag . How can I answer , Linda ? I just don 't know . Excuse me . Do you know the girl who lives here with her uncle ? Clarisse . - They came for them . - Who ? - To take them away . - The police ? Not the police ? The firemen ? They came to take them away . They do that now , don 't they ? Only to question them . They let them come back . You can 't tell , can you ? They weren 't like us . They were special . You see over there ? And there . And there too . Do you see ? Ow look at their house . There 's nothing . Here , you ! Come here ! What 's the meaning of this ? - Sir ... - Look ! How often must I talk to you about this ? I talked to you about it in the office the other day , didn 't I ? Why can 't you do what you 're told ? Eh ? Why can 't you ? Look ! Look at you ! Look ! Did I tell you to ... Haven 't you got a head ? - Is the captain in ? - Hejust stepped out . - Didn 't you pass him ? - O. Captain . Yeah ? The people who were arrested last night , sir . It 's about time . - How long have you been with us ? - Three years , sir . Yes , you 're a good man . Remind me to give you one of my personal medallions . The likeness is remarkable . You 'll see . I , uh ... You , uh ... I already have one , sir . Oh , so it was you , was it ? How did you get in ? I needed some information about some arrests that were made last night . I wanted to see some identifications . Ah ! So Montag 's handling the arrests now , is he ? Oh , no , sir , not at all . Last night , you said . But the identifications wouldn 't be there . Ot yet . In fact , they 've just been handed to me . Let 's see now . Let 's see if they 're amongst this lot . - Oh , they 're the ones ! - I see . A little young for him ... I 'd say . He 's her uncle . - Friends of yours ? - Oh , no , sir . I know them slightly . - They live nearby . - Ah . - And you 'd like their house , is that it ? - Yes , sir , that 's it . Well , the house will have to be requisitioned ... but you can 't move in until the niece has been arrested too . Oh , she ... She 's still at large then ? For the moment , yes . Look at the identification . It hasn 't been stamped yet . It 's just a matter of a day or two . We 'll get you your house . Hmm ? How did you get in ? Oh , now , what 's all this about ? Hmm ? Still shaky ? You shouldn 't have come in . Look at you . You look like death . Some fresh air , that 's what you need . A nice bit of fresh air will put you right again . Incidentally , if you see that niece wandering about this part of the world ... you might let us know . It might expedite the matter of the house . Of course , sir . - Clarisse , I must talk to you . - Ot here . - What happened ? - Uncle was arrested . I got away . But how did it happen ? They came last night . We were all asleep . Come on . Look , I have to get home . It 's terribly important . Uncle woke me up and told me to get away . I escaped through the skylight over the roof . This is the last place you should have come to . I know , but there 's something I must find . Look , please stay with me . I 'm frightened . All right , I 'll stay with you . - It must be here somewhere . - What must be here ? Something . Something I have to find . - Find and destroy . - Let me look . - You wouldn 't know where to start looking . - It was my job . - How big ? - About this big . - Papers . - Oh . It 's no use . - We 'll find it . Don 't you worry . - It 's a list of addresses . Friends of my uncle ; who they are and where they 're hiding . We 'll find it . What are you doing ? - We must destroy these . - Uh-huh . I always wanted to tell you ... our meeting in the monorail was no accident . I noticed you , and I followed you . I thought you could help us . I knew it when that old woman killed herself . - I realized there was a connection between you . - Yes . - She was afraid she 'd talk and give us away . - Yes . And I ... This morning , what do I do ? I get into a little bit of trouble ... and I faint like a silly little girl . I can 't be a fireman any more . What is that over there ? That ? That 's a rocking chair . People used to sit ... outside their houses on warm evenings and rock backwards and forwards . - Oh , really ? - Talking to anyone passing by . Just talking . We 'll have to go away from here . I know a place . My uncle told me what to do if ever he was ... If ever he was taken . You follow the river upstream ' til you come to the old steam railway line . Then you go on and you go on until you get to where the Book people live . - The good people ? - O , Book . The Book people . - You 've not heard of them ? - No . People who vanished . Some were arrested and managed to escape . Others were released . Some didn 't wait to be arrested . They just hid themselves away . Up in the farm country ; the woods and the hills . They live there in little groups . The law can 't touch them . They live quite peaceably and do nothing that 's forbidden . Though , if they came into the city , they might not last long . But how can you call them Book people ... if they don 't do anything against the law ? They are books . Each one , men and women ... everyone , commits a book they 've chosen to memory , and they become the books . Of course , every now and then , someone gets stopped , arrested . Which is why they live so cautiously . Because the secret they carry is the most precious secret in the world . With them , all human knowledge would pass away . - You must come with me . - Oh , no , not yet . Uh , it is too soon for me . I was still burning books . Yes , in time , perhaps . But now everything in my life has suddenly changed . I must stay in the city . I have a plan . I will hide a book in every fireman 's house and then denounce him . The system will eat itself . We must burn the pyromaniacs out . Ow we have to go . Separately . You to your Book people and me to strip this off . We shall see each other again . O , we shan 't . Why pretend we shall ? You are right . We shan 't . Fit and well again ? Good , excellent . Come on , hurry , no time to lose . I 'm sorry , sir . I was on my way to tell you ... I shan 't be staying with the force , sir . Shan 't be ? But this isn 't how things are done , Montag . - Ot on the eve of promotion . - I shan 't be coming in tomorrow . Tomorrow 's another day . Today you 're under my command . Montag , I 'm asking you , as one man to another . Please . Please ! You can 't let me down like this in front of the men , not in front of the others . Just this one last call . Then you can do as you like . Montag . This is my house ! Mm-hmm , that 's right . - Linda ! - I couldn 't bear it . I just couldn 't bear it any more . Well , now , Montag knows exactly what we 're looking for . I think we can leave it to him . To know how to find , one must first know how to hide . Isn 't that so ? I like a man who knows his work . You men , just check the rest of the house . Everything ready , Fabian ? Come on , hurry it up . Come on , bring us the sparkler . As this is Montag 's home , I think , perhaps , he should do the honours . What are you doing in there ! Have you gone mad ? Come on , get back in there ! Just the books ! The books ! What do you think you 're doing ? There 's no need for that ! I said the books , Montag ! That 's good . That 's what I like to see . Sweet reason . Ovels aren 't life . What did Montag hope to get out of all this print ? Happiness ? What a poor idiot you must have been . This gibberish is enough to drive a man mad . Thought you could learn from these how to walk on the waters , did you ? Montag must learn to think a little . Consider how all these writings , all these recipes for happiness disagree . Ow let this heap of contradictions burn itself out . You know it 's we who , at this moment , are working for man 's happiness . Look , isn 't that lovely ? The pages ... like flower petals or butterflies , luminous and black . Who can explain the fascination of fire ? What draws us to it ? Whether we 're young or old . Nothing to say ? That 's the spirit . - That 's real wisdom . - He still has one . What have you got there ? Is this your special book ? It 's got to be burned with the others , and you 're under arrest . Montag . Get out of there ! Everybody , out of here quick ! He 's gone mad ! Right now ! Go ! Watch for a man running through the streets . Repeating . Calling all citizens . Wanted for murder : Montag . Occupation : Fireman . The criminal is alone and on foot . Let each one stand at his front door . Look and listen . Watch for a man running through the streets . Repeating . Calling all citizens . Wanted for murder : Montag . Occupation : Fireman . The criminal is alone and on foot . Let each one stand at his front door . Look and listen . - I am , uh ... - Yes , we know who you are . You 're the man of the hour . Come . - Come and witness your own capture . - My capture ? That 's right . Our beautiful cousin is being ... particularly entertaining today . You 'll see . Oh , I beg your pardon . I am TheJournal of Henri Brilard by Stendhal . Montag is still at large , but time is running out fast . Ah , there it is . The Aerial Patrol has sighted the wanted man . They can 't keep the viewers waiting much longer . The show must go on . They 'll find somebody . Anybody will do to provide them with their climax . - There he is . You can see him clearly now . There is Montag , running headlong into the trap ... scurrying about like a frightened rat . Just look at him , cousins . It 's all over , cousins . Montag is dead . A crime against society has been avenged . They never showed the man 's face properly . It was too far away , of course . Even your friends are bound to believe you 're dead . Here . You may as well shed your old skin . " The moon was shining sulkily ... " Because she thought the sun ... " Had got no business to be there ... " After the day was done . 'It 's very rude of him , ' she said . " Are you interested in Plato 's Republic ? - Uh ... - Well , I am Plato 's Republic . - I 'll recite myself for you whenever you like . - Thank you very much . Ow here 's Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte . And here 's The Corsair by Byron . She used to be married to a chief of police . Now that skinny fellow is Alice In Wonderland by Lewis Carroll . Where 's Alice Through the Looking-Glass today ? She should be somewhere about . There 's Pilgrim 's Progress by John Bunyan . He ate his book so they couldn 't burn it . Waiting For Godot by Samuel Beckett . Oh , you see the little blonde coming towards us ? Watch her blush . I 'm Jean-Paul Sartre 's TheJewish Question . Delighted to meet you . I 'm The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury . - Allow me to introduce ... - Oh . May I ? - The Pickwick Papers , Charles Dickens . - Oh , Charles Dickens . Once I read a book he wrote : - David Copperfield . - We have a David Copperfield amongst us . He 's with another group in the south . - I am The Prince by Machiavelli . - Oh . As you see , you can 't judge a book by its cover . I am Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice . Both of you the same book ? - My brother is volume one . - My brother is volume two . It 's a great pleasure to meet you . We call the first one Pride . The other one 's Prejudice . I don 't think they like it much . Here , we 're only 50 or so , but there are many , many more scattered around . In abandoned railway yards , wandering the roads . Tramps outwardly , but , inwardly , libraries . Oh , it wasn 't planned . It just so happened that a man here and a man there loved some book . And rather than lose it , he learned it . And we came together . We 're a minority of undesirables crying out in the wilderness . But it won 't always be so . One day we shall be called on , one by one , to recite what we 've learned . And then books will be printed again . And when the next age of darkness comes ... those who come after us will do again as we have done . - I have one with me . - Yes ? What is it ? Let me see . " Tales of Mystery And Imagination by Edgar Allen Poe . " - Learn it quickly , so that we can burn it . - You burn it ? We have to , so that no one can take them away from us . Yes , we burn the books . But we keep them up here where nobody can find them . As a matter of fact , we 've just burned The Memoirs of Saint Simon . You see , Montag , that man over there hasn 't much longer to live . He 's The Weir of Hermiston by Robert Louis Stevenson . The boy is his nephew . He 's now reciting himself , so the boy can become the book . " ' I will be very quiet , ' replied Archie . And I will be boldly frank . I do not love my father . I wonder sometimes if I do not hate him . " " ' I will be very quiet , ' replied Archie . And I will be boldly frank . I do not love my father . I wonder sometimes if I do not hate him . " " There 's my shame , perhaps my sin . At least , and in the sight of God , not my fault . " " There 's my shame , perhaps my sin . At least , and in the sight of God , not my fault . " " How was I to love him ? " He has never spoken to me , never smiled upon me . I do not think he ever touched me . " " How was I to love him ? He has never spoken to me , never smiled upon me . And I do not think he ever touched me . " " He was more afraid of death than of anything else . " And he died as he thought he would ... while the first snows of winter fell . " " He was more afraid of death than of anything else . - " And he died ... " - " And he died while the first ... " - " He died as he thought ... " - " And he died as he thought ...

" And he died as he thought he would ... while the first snows of winter fell . " - " I 'm going to relate a tale full of horror . " - " I would gladly suppress it , were it not a chronicle . " " Now , how much there is to tell ... " " At that moment , Mr Pickwick ... "

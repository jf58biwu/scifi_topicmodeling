 Go home , Corporal . Keep your mouth shut . I expect to find you that way when I get back . Yes , sir . I 'll get the general . General , we 've got one . Fine . Fine work , Archie . Who 've you got in there ? He 's on fire ! Halt ! Halt , or I 'll shoot ! The one in that cell is gone , too . I want this stuff analyzed by 9 : 00 tomorrow morning . NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Phyllis Thaxter ... Lin McCarthy ... Alfred Ryder ... Kent Smith ... and special guest star James Daly . NARRATOR : For two years David Vincent has been waging war on two fronts : One , against the alien invaders , the other , an attempt to enlist allies in high places while there is still time . Now , finally , with the help of some friends in the military , David Vincent is opening the second front . Colonel Harmon . That 's right . In the car , please . Yesterday , you kidnapped one of our people . Brought him in here . All right . We want him back . Sorry . We 'll exchange . You for him . He 's dead . No . We would have heard . From an officer named Vance , you mean . You won 't hear from him again . Colonel Harmon 's apartment . I 'm afraid you 've lost your bargaining position , Colonel . So close . All that hassle to get a live one . I hope we haven 't blown it . At least we have the government involved now . Maybe . Concannon is chief of Hemisphere Command . He saw one go . So , that puts Concannon on our side . That could be an advantage . I don 't know . Archie tells me you and Concannon don 't get along very well . Just a personal thing . Nothing to do with this . So , the government 's in on this . That means we might get some action . I hope Archie gets home soon . Is there someone in your apartment ? Perhaps a cleaning woman . Leave her out of this . Open it . ( tires squealing ) Thanks . I suspect I was about to be found dead in my own bed . Any luck with the ashes ? No . No , they were only cellulose fibers . The Bureau of Standards has the analysis . Concannon wants to see you . Good . What 's on his mind ? The only thing he 'd tell me is that he was speaking for the president . Mr. Vincent , I 'm glad you could come . I know how busy you are . General . I 'm sorry I 'm late . Not at all . Not at all . Please sit down . Thank you . You 're , uh , in this with Edgar Scoville . Is that right ? Yes . How is he ? He 's fine ... busy . I 've always liked Edgar . We , uh , had a little spat a few years back so I don 't see much of him anymore . It was probably my fault . Tell him I asked , would you ? I will . Of what I 'm about to say , Mr. Vincent I want you to read between the lines and draw whatever conclusions you think are warranted . Is that all right ? Yes , sir . We know they 're here . We know who they are and what they are and we mean to do something about it . I 'm saying this on the highest possible official level . We understand each other ? Good . Now , before I tell you what our approach might be , I want to ask you : How strong are they , militarily ? Well , Colonel Harmon , uh , has looked at our files . He 'd be better qualified to answer that . HARMON : Strong and getting stronger . We 'd guess they won 't attack until they get more gear and people down here , but when they do ... it won 't be much fun . We don 't want a war . It 's insane to want war these days . There 's no reason on God 's green Earth why we can 't live peaceably with these people . Will they talk to us ? I don 't know . They seem to think they can get what they want by taking it . What do they want ? Everything . We can give them everything , within reason if we know how much land they need ... facilities , technology . Will they talk about that ? If they think they have nothing to lose . They 'll be afraid we 'll try to expose them ... unite the whole world against them . " Expose them " ? Good Lord , no . All we want to do is talk with them privately- - a few of our people , a few of theirs- - see if we can 't settle this thing ... responsibly , that 's all . Well , I 'm inclined to agree with Colonel Harmon . If they know you know , they might speed things up and we 'll find ourselves in an all-out war . Mr. Vincent ... do you know what a doomsday device is ? No , I don 't . Colonel . In theory , it 's , uh , an automatic self-detonating bomb designed to go off under certain rigidly defined circumstances destroying the whole world- - the ultimate weapon . If we can 't get together with these people , we could tell them that we 're going to build one of those things . I don 't know whether we can or can 't but if they think we can- - if they think that we 'll blow up the world before we 'll hand it over to them- - they might have to sit down and bargain . What do you think about that ? I think they 'll listen . Good- - so do I. Now , about finding another one of these aliens ... ? Well , what about the one who got away ? I saw the car and the license-plate number . I 'm sure it could be traced . Fine . You let me know if there 's anything I can do . You 've been carrying a heavy load . It 's time we helped out . Archie . David . You , uh , let me know as soon as you find one of these people we can talk to and , uh , take care of yourself . Thank you . That 's a fine boy , Archie . He 'll do it . ( crickets chirping ) ( door opening ) Better shoot now . You 'll never get me to your people . I don 't want to shoot . I want to talk . Let 's go inside . ( door closes ) ( door closes ) ( door closes ) Sarah ? Come on in , Archie . Sit down . Hello , dearest . Hello , Archie . Oh , there you are . Hi , Sarah . Have a good day ? Quite a good day . You ? Did the gardener show up ? Mm-hmm- - chrysanthemums will be out next week and he thinks the new roses are lovely . What about the woodchucks ? Oh , maybe one or two traces . Nothing serious . Well , maybe after dinner , I 'll take Billy out and we 'll shoot some . The gardener said we could spray the ground , Sam . That would be the best way , he thought . And have you breathe that noxious stuff and get sick again ? Oh , no . Archie , you want to shoot some woodchucks with us after dinner ? What do you use on them ? A .270 With a soft - nosed slug , 180 grains . They want war , I 'll give them war . What made it a good day , Archie ? Oh , you 'd better ask the boss . Sam ? We , uh ... solved a problem . Good . The one that kept you up last night ? Was I up ? I don 't remember . ( chuckling ) : I guess so . Did I , uh , say anything ? Well , come on , dearest . We don 't have secrets from Archie . Did I talk in my sleep ? What about ? Armageddon ... doomsday ... sounded like the end of the world . You know I never ask about your work . No , you don 't , Sarah . He 's working too hard , isn 't he , Archie ? I mean , it 's not as if we were 20 years old . Can 't you get him to slow down ? Nope . When you don 't sleep at night , I worry . Hi , Uncle Archie . Hello , Billy . Hey , Billy . Hi , Dad . Dinner ready ? Let your father finish his drink . Would you like to shoot some woodchuck after dinner ? Well ... Huh ? Yeah , sure . Attaboy . You men go in to dinner . I , uh , want to speak to Sarah for a moment . Hey , come along , Billy . Don 't you ever , ever , ever say that I 'm too old to do my work in front of Archie or anybody else . All I can do is take you to the man I report to . Fair enough . Well , well , well , Edgar . How good to see you again . General . I 'm going to need your good counsel here today , Edgar . Sit down . Sit down . Will you have some coffee before we begin ? Thank you , no . Have you heard from David ? We 've given him a big task . Rome wasn 't built in a day . Caesar was killed in a minute . Edgar , what do you think about this idea of a doomsday device ? Very effective . If anything can make them talk , that 's it . I think so . Could you build one ? Why ? Can one be built ? Could you build it ? No . I couldn 't build one , and I wouldn 't if I could . Fine . Can anyone ? I mean , hypothetically . I hope not . It would be insane . To put us at the mercy of a machine that couldn 't be shut down ? There 's an accident factor that 's impossible to calculate . I suspect you 're exactly right , Edgar . Still , if the time ever came , I 'm sure there 'd be other opinions . Nice to see you again , Mr. Vincent . Have my people been treating you well ? Oh , yes , very . As a matter of fact , they gave me aspirin for the headache I acquired when I was clubbed . Aw , forgive them . They were under the impression that , as usual , you meant us no good . But this time , you do have our best interests at heart . And ours . Good . You want to give us what , now ? Land ? A helping hand ? Peace ? Things like that ? I 'm in no position to offer you anything . I 'm here to ask you if you 'll talk with the man who can . Hmm , who says he speaks for your president . Yes . What do you want in exchange for these things you 'll give us ? Permanent cease-fire . Sir ? Hmm ? Sit down with them , they 'll use it as a chance to expose you . They 'll unite . Create any safeguard you like . We want only to talk . He 's lying . He 's been trying to tell the world too long . It 's all in the open now . One of your men burned in the general 's office building yesterday . They know you 're here . Either you talk with them or they 'll begin building the doomsday device . Mr. Vincent , you and the general come here tonight at 8 : 00 . But drive in slowly in one car . Don 't tell anyone you 're coming or bring anyone with you . Then , if I feel like it , we might talk . Go after him . Watch him . Well , they 're talking tonight . Edgar , you know something I don 't know ? I mean , uh , this is what we 've been working for . This is big news . You want me to honk my horn ? What is it between you and Concannon ? I told you , a personal thing . Archie Harmon has served under him for 28 years . Says he 'd walk through hell with him . I knew him for five minutes and went through hell with Concannon . I was subcontracting for the early moon shots . Remember when the rocket blew up on the pad ? It 's happened a couple of times . Well , this time it killed two men , two boys . Concannon headed the board of inquiry . Will you take my word for what caused the explosion ? Sure . Human error . A technician pushed the launch button before the fuel chamber was secured . And Concannon blamed you . I think his exact words were " Edgar Scoville murdered those two boys " just as surely as if he 'd shot them in the head . " In better days , we would have and could have hanged him for it . " Did he have any reason at all for holding you responsible ? One . He told Archie Harmon he thought the public needed a scapegoat and he was going to give them one . Me . Hmm . Well , I think we 're going to have to go along with him . He 's going to be there at the meeting himself . I don 't think he 'll pull anything . He is speaking for the president . That 's what he says . We 're being followed . If you trust them , you 've nothing to worry about . If you trust Concannon . Sam ? What is it , dear ? I have a nice surprise for you . The lobsters came early this year . Oh , isn 't that fine ? Archie , do you remember Jack Barney ? From the march ? A corporal ? From Bataan ? That 's the fellow . What did you think about on the march more than anything else ? Milk . I thought of a two-quart glass of ice-cold milk . I could taste it in my sleep . With me , it was lobsters- - sweet , little , pound-and-a-half chicken lobsters . I told Barney , and he promised me if we ever got out alive he 'd send a dozen every year , and he has . Isn 't that fine ? Would you like one tonight ? I 'd love one tonight , Sarah . Oh . We 've crossed a lot of bridges together since the Philippines , haven 't we , Archie ? I 'd say so . And this is the toughest one yet . You 'll get us across , sir . You always have . Sometimes I don 't know why you put up with me , Archie . I 'm a mean old crock , aren 't I ? Sometimes . You know I don 't mean anything by it . You 're family to me . Thank you , sir . I know . Can I buy you a drink ? If you 'll join me . Sure you won 't come in ? Sure . Good luck tonight , David . Thanks . Sarah ? You 'd better write all that down for me before I forget . Oh , I 'm going to have to eat and run , dear . Is dinner ready ? Almost . Just bring me one lobster , no salad or anything . You and Archie and Billy can eat after I 've gone . Uh , are you hungry ? No , thank you . Sit down . Sit down . Tonight , right away ? This is fine , fine work , Mr. Vincent . It 'll only take me a minute to eat . Sarah , as quickly as you can . What conditions did they make ? Two people , the general and myself . They 'll be watching the meeting place . Incidentally , they sent someone to follow me here . Do you really think they 'll talk ? I think they 'll talk about talking . Wonderful . Oh , thank you , darling . You 're sure you won 't join me ? No , thank you . Well , keep talking . Keep talking . They took me to a farmhouse in Virginia . Who did you meet with ? I 've met him before . He 's one of their leaders . He trusts us ? Not really . Enough to take the first step , I guess . HARMON : Old Chinese proverb- - " Journey of a thousand Miles begins with a single step . " Now , we 're on our way , buddy . Hmm ... ( clearing throat ) Uh ... ( choking ) Sarah ! ( coughing and gagging ) Poisoned ... I 've been poisoned . I-I 've been poisoned . ( siren wailing ) SARAH : Was it food poisoning ? Poison poisoning . Billy , go wrap up that lobster in waxed paper for me ... and watch yourself . Yes , sir . What was it ? I don 't know yet . Nothing that was going to do you any good . A little more and you might not be asking me . Who did it , Sam ? Whoever it is , I 'll get him . You go home now , Bill . Take your hearse with you . Not a chance . Go home . I 'm not going to your morgue . Everybody , please clear out except Archie and you , Mr. Vincent . Nice people we 're dealing with , Mr. Vincent . They don 't trust us- - as soon as you tell them we know they 're here , this happens . I don 't know . They wanted to talk . They could have killed me . What sense does it make ? They don 't want you . They want him . There are easier ways . He was going to meet them . It 's off . We tried to talk to them . I wanted to talk to them- - you know that . Let me talk to them again . Are you out of your mind ? I say no , son . You 'd be committing suicide . We had a few like that on Corregidor . Yeah , tough monkeys . All dead . Mr. Vincent , until the general had this trouble , you were going to live up to your part of this ? Every word . The general , too , I suppose ? Yes . Alone , you 're useless to us . You have no authority . But I do have the authority to arrange another meeting . Mr. Ryder , you 'd better be interested . They 're about to build the doomsday device , remember ? Is that a threat , Mr. Vincent ? Yes . If you still want to talk , it perhaps might be possible . That has to be your decision . Now , I 'm not sure the general would come . Sit down . Let 's see if we can 't arrive at satisfactory terms . Who is it ? Me . How are you feeling ? Come sit by me , Sarah . Dr. Jacobs says you 'll be fine . Sarah , how long have we been married ? 23 years . Good years ? Oh , now , don 't make it sound that way . We 'll have 23 more . Sarah ? Hmm ? Why did you try to kill me ? Why did I try ... Sam , pl ... I called that corporal Barney . He didn 't send the lobsters . But then somebody ... I called the market . You bought them , Sarah . Sam , please ... Why ? Tell me why . To stop you . From what ? What you 're going to do . You talked about it in your sleep . But kill me ... ? Not kill you . I didn 't want you going there tonight , but I wasn 't trying to kill you . ( phone ringing ) It was only the spray I used on the grounds to make you sick , Sam . Please ! Mom ? ( phone continues ringing ) Yes ? They still want the meeting , General . After they tried to poison me ? He said they had nothing to do with that . I believe them . What conditions ? Tomorrow , 12 : 00 noon . The farmhouse . They 'll have all their top people from all over the world ... if you will , too . How many ? No more than six . All right . He 'll be there . Get out my uniform , would you , dearest ? Archie ... set up a meeting in my office in one hour . Cullenbine , Schoonover , Rush and Zagor . Get Scoville there , too . Right . See you there . Oh , yes , I 'm fine . Dad ... why was mom screaming a minute ago ? She was worried about me , Billy , but I 'm fine now . Thanks for asking , son . I don 't know what it 's about , but anything that gets me out of a bridge game with John and Maxine is an improvement . Wait outside , please . Gentlemen . You all know me . I 'm not a dramatic man . I 'll just say what I have to say and leave it at that . We 're into something pretty big and unless we act together- - correctly , immediately- - our country and our world may not survive . Take these envelopes to a farmhouse 200 yards from a school , 4.2 miles due east of the intersections of Routes 9 and 106 in Virginia . Arrive a little before noon . Do not open the envelopes until noon . Your instructions are inside . General , I would ... There will be no discussion . I have been given these instructions . That 's all , gentlemen . Good luck to you . Edgar ... Yes , General ? I know how you feel about the doomsday device , but you must , without argument , be present at that meeting to convince the other side that it can be built- - not will be , but can be . General Concannon , I ... Edgar ... I have been given these instructions . Yes , sir . General Ludwig , please . Samuel Concannon calling . General . Sam Concannon . Fine , thank you , sir . How are you ? Good . What I 'm calling about , General , is that my aide Colonel Harmon and I want to fly a practice bomb run . He needs to get his hours in , and , uh ... Tomorrow would be fine . Morning ? 1100 ? We 're checked out on 86s , 100s , 47s and 52s . Whatever is easiest for your people . Full crew . Gassed and ready to go at Andrews Field . Thank you very much , General . I 'm much obliged to you . Hope to see you soon . Sit down , Archie . Sit down . This is General Samuel Arlington Concannon , Commander of Hemisphere Defense for the United States of America . For 36 years , I have served my country as soldier statesman and patriot . No one can question my love for America . In recent days , I have learned that our country faces the gravest threat to her existence in her history . We have been invaded by beings from another planet- - beings who bear us great malice and who will not be content while any of us remain alive . I have , as a consequence , determined to take immediate and forceful action against them ... although this action will certainly cost some American lives including some of my most devoted friends and possibly my own and that of my devoted aide for 28 years , Colonel Harmon . What we have done is this . We 've invited the top leadership of these beings to a meeting where they will be destroyed . Without leaders , soldiers have no army . It is our hope that they will go home , retreat from the battle and leave us with our ... beloved America . Militarily , the plan is sound . With God 's help , it will succeed . Did I leave anything out ? God ... bless America . Oh . I would have forgotten that . What would I do without you , Archie ? These gentlemen will accompany us to the plane , just in case . And you 'd better give me a refresher course in flying , just in case . Get in the ship . Stay overhead where you can see us . If they 're doing this to expose us or capture us , come down here and pull us out . It 's time to go , Archie . Yes , sir . Good-bye , Sarah . Good-bye . Good-bye , my dearest . Have a good day . You , too , Sam . I thought you were going to be at the farm , Mr. Vincent . I was under the impression I 'd be going with you and I had no idea you 'd be leaving this early . Archie and I have some government business to take care of . You wait here . If there 's time , we 'll pick you up . If not , you 've done your job and done it well . Thank you . That 's a fine boy , Archie . I 'm glad he won 't be killed . Terrible responsibility ordering men to their deaths . Go ahead . General ... Archie , trust me just one more time . There 's a right way to do these things and take it from me , I 'm doing it . You tell the crew the target ? Yes , sir . But not why ? No , sir . Good boy . Now get this monster off the ground and I 'll be able to take over . We might just make it , Archie . Surprise us both , huh ? Ready to give ' em what for ? Come on ! Archie said that ? What else ? That I was to try and reach you . He thought you could get everyone away from the farm . There 's no phone at the farm . Marge , it 's David . Let me speak to Scoville . How long ago did he leave ? You are negotiating for your people ? I presume so ... among others . I 'm not to open my instructions for another five minutes . When will the general arrive ? Shortly , I imagine . Like swimming or riding a bicycle . Once you know how , you never forget . General , there 's something I 've got to talk to you about . Shoot . Where are we going ? To look at a farm . Oh , are we going to buy one ? No . Mom , what 's the matter ? Billy , your father 's not as young as he used to be . He 's been working very hard . He 's under a strain . They were getting ready to retire him before this . Before what ? He 's about to drop a bomb on some people . We 're going to ask him not to . Apparently , he said he 's speaking for the president when he isn 't at all . We don 't know the whole story . What are you talking about ? Just that if we don 't stop him , we 'll be at war . Your father loves us very much . When he knows we 're at the farm , he won 't bomb it . I don 't believe you . Why didn 't you call the Air Force ? They 'd stop him . Because then everyone would know about it . We 're going to stop him ourselves . Why is he doing this ? He 's used to living violently . That 's the only way he knows how to get things done . You what ? I ordered the crew off , sir . There 's just two of us flying this thing . I didn 't know any other way to stop you . Take over . " Stop me " ? Stop me from what ? You bomb that farmhouse , General , you 'll be killing good people- - your friends . I know that ! You 're a soldier , Harmon ... or I thought you were . Whoever told you you can make an omelet without breaking eggs ? Not only kill good people ... they 'll retaliate . They 'll kill as many of us as they can . All right , they 'll kill a few of us , but the rest of us will be an army . The world will know . The bombs start to fall , what world ? Just give it to them without a fight ? Roll over , bellies up ? This whole charade you went through just to get ' em to the table so you could bomb them . You never intended to talk to them . " Talk . " People don 't understand talk . A kick in the teeth . That 's what they understand . ( chuckles sardonically ) 28 years I trusted a coward . What did you tell Sarah ? I told her I was going to try to talk you out of it . If I couldn 't , she was going to try to get everyone away from the farm . Go there with Billy , so you wouldn 't bomb it . That 's what they understand . At least we know they aren 't Chinese . Edgar ! Concannon 's flying in . He 's going to bomb this place in less than a minute . Ryder , do you have a broadcast radio here ? Outside in a truck . Make an all-bands transmission over a ten-mile radius . Talk to your husband . Sam ... dearest ... Billy and I are here at the farm . We don 't want you to do this . Please don 't . Sam , can you hear me ? Don 't do this . Talk to me ! Please talk to me ! Sam , can you hear me ? Don 't do this ! Sam , talk to me ! Please talk to me ! I 'm sorry , Sarah . Sam , listen to me ! Mrs. Concannon , I 'm sorry . We tried , but there are other people who live in this area . Can your men destroy that plane ? We have less than a minute . There 's a plane in the area . Destroy it at once . Archie Harmon 's on that plane . ( hydraulic whirring ) ( eerie whirring ) If we find someone else who will talk with you ? Put yourself in my position , Mr. Vincent . Would you take another chance ? I would . One man like Concannon doesn 't mean we couldn 't work it out . There are men in our government- - responsible , reasonable , sane men you can talk to . If we get someone who is speaking for our president , will you listen ? I don 't know . Will he listen to you ? NARRATOR : David Vincent returns to his war against the invader . He returns to his search for another day and another place where the powers from both sides will meet again and an armistice will become a reality .

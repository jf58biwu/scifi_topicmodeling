 [ Engines Roaring ] [ Man On Speaker ] Please fasten your seat belt , Senator Clark . We 're landing . Senator . I 'm Dr. Phillips - Doug Phillips . I hope we haven 't kept you waiting . [ Switch Clicks ] Mobile Tic-Tod to Tic-Toc Base . Permission to enter . Code : Red Lion . [ Man On Phone ] Tic-Toc Base to Mobile Tic-Toc 1 . Permission granted . - Dr. Phillips . - Jiggs . This is Senator Clark . This is Master Sergeant Jiggs , the ramrod of our security forces . Glad to meet you , Senator . - I 'll take that , please . - Security , Senator . Senator . There are over 72 , 000 personnel quartered in each of those complexes . Each complex is over 800 floors deep . You know , Phillips , every time I check your budget figures ... I ask myself the same question : ls time travel really worth all this ? Senator , the control of time ... is potentially the most valuable treasure that man will ever find . Well , it 's certainly the most costly . Will you come with me , please . Senator . Hang on . We 're going into free fall for 800 floors . There 's much more to see below . It 'll be over in a few seconds , Senator . - An old friend of yours , I believe . - Leroy . - Hello , Leroy . - Woody . My , it 's been a long time . How did they ever get an old dogface like you out of the mud ? Huh . Worst paratroop officer I ever commanded . I told him to go into politics , where he couldn 't hurt anyone . Aw , come on . That was meant to be a gag , not a dig . Now what 's all this , uh , investigation nonsense ? Well , I think you can guess why I 'm here , Woody . Oh , of course . Come over here a minute . Did you ever see anything like this before in your life ? No , I can 't say that I have . That 's what I 'm here to talk about . General . I think Tony ought to be in on this . - Where is he ? - In the Tunnel . This way . [ Computers whirring ] So that 's the monster that 's cost us all this money , hmm ? Yes , Senator . Well , Leroy , what do you think ? - Pretty expensive toy . - Toy ? Hardly a toy , Senator . These are the control banks where our electrical power is mixed . You 've probably heard of Dr. Raymond Swain ? Undoubtedly the finest mind in electronics living in the world today . And that 's Dr. Ann MacGregor , our supervising electro-biologist . Her unit determines the amount of force and heat ... a time traveler can sustain . According to your reports , all you 've ever ... - sent back in time are mice and monkeys . - So far , yes . How do you know they weren 't just disintegrated ? Disintegration would cause some residue in matter . Have you ever returned any of these animals to this laboratory safe and sound ? - Nut yet , no . But - - Then so far as we know ... this whole thing might be just a fancy disappearing act . - Isn 't that true ? - Actually , at this point - You 're guessing , Doctor , and , so far , your guessing ... has cost the United States government 7 1 / 2 billion dollars . This way , Senator . Tony ! Could you come out here a minute ? Doug . It 's gonna work . I just finished the polarization , and it just feels right . - Take a look . - Senator Leroy Clark . Dr. Anthony Newman . - Excuse me , Senator . - Doctor ? You seem a little young for that title ... not to mention being number two man on this project . His youth is only a disguise , Senator . Inside is an old genius struggling to get out . I 'm glad you were interested enough in our project to pay us a personal call , Senator . Let 's just say I don 't like to scrap billions of dollars by just sending a memo . - Scrap ? - Tony . The senator feels our experiments haven 't shown enough success ... to warrant the time and money invested . - But we 're so close now . - Close to what , son ? To sending a man back in time and returning him , of course . Well , then do it . No more promises , boys . I want a fact I can grab hold of . - By when ? - When ? You and the general have been on this for 1 O years . You 've been with the project almost seven . I say the time is now . You mean today ? That 's right , because tomorrow afternoon I 'm flying back to Washington ... to write you a blank check ... or cut your umbilical cord . Leroy , you - We are not ready to risk a life . Doug . Let me try it . Absolutely not . We just give up . Is that it ? We 've put our lives into this project . I 'm not going to commit murder ... and I 'm not going to allow you to commit suicide just to satisfy a budget . That 's no answer . That 's not even science . Excuse me . He seems a little emotional for a scientist . [ Clicks Tongue ] Anything else you want to show me ? - Plenty . - Leroy , we haven 't even begun . Senator . [ Computers Whirring ] [ Oscillating ] This is a red alert ! Red alert ! All Time Tunnel personnel report to their stations on the double ! [ Alarms Blaring ] [ Electrical Charges Firing ] It 's Tony . - Doug , can 't you stop him ? - Not now . He 'd burn alive . - George , start the countdown . - [ Man ] Sixteen , 75 ... 14 , 13 ... - 72 , 77 , 70 - [ Continues Counting ] - What 's happening to him ? He 's in a radiation freeze . It 's the first step in his relocation . - ... four , three , two ... - Pray that it works . - one , zero ! - [ High-pitched Tone ] - [ Tone Stops ] - All right . Start location probe . Jerry , see if you can synchronize the time curve . Ray , give us a power-and-distance ratio . - Ann , find what specific radiation Tony is . - I 'll try . - Well , where is he ? - [ Flipping Switches ] He could be living in yesterday or next week or a million years from now . - How do you know ? - You 've got your guinea pig , Sen - - Doug ! - Okay , take a sock at me if it 'll make you feel better . But I 'd still like to know what 's going on . [ Exhales ] Tony just finished developing that radiation bath . That was the blue mist you saw just before he disappeared . Now , in theory , this should give us a magnetic fix - like a homing device - to enable us to locate him in time . In theory . What if it doesn 't work ? Well , then he 'll be lost in time for the rest of his life . [ Electrical Charges Firing ] [ Ship 's Horn Blowing ] G , ' [ Dance Band : Slow Ragtime ] - Are you hurt ? - [ Quietly ] I 've made it . Hmm ? You are hurt . I 'll call someone . Oh , no , no . I 'm - - I 'm fine . Really . - But you had a very bad fall . ♪ ♪ [ Continues , Muffled ] I , uh-l didn 't look where I was going .

Uh , do , uh , all Americans adopt the vigorous life ... just to , uh , please your Teddy Roosevelt ? - Teddy ? - Mr. Roosevelt . Oh , no . I , uh-l guess I should have put on a jacket . I didn 't think it would be so cold . Then you 've , uh , never spent April in London . I do hope it 'll be warmer when we reach New York . Is that where - That is , are you making your first trip to New York ? As a matter of fact , I am . Does it show ? Oh , no . No , of course not . I - I just wondered . Not that I 'm one of those Europeans who think there are still , uh ... cowboys and Indians in New York . But it is the other side of the world , isn 't it ? - That depends on which side you start from . - Touché . I haven 't noticed you in the dining room the past three days . Are you a man of mystery , Mr. Newman ? I 've , uh , been eating in my cabin - catching up on some work . Well , it 's bad luck to work on Saturday nights ... particularly when it 's the 13th . - Saturday , April 13 . - Are you superstitious ? Oh , no . No , I 've ... just been working so much ... I 've lost all track of time . Well , I think I ... better get that jacket . See you again , Miss Hall . [ Children Chattering ] [ Shuffleboard Disc Clatters ] [ Whispering ] Titanic ? - Any luck ? - No , not yet . Doug , we 've collated the automatic settings that Tony used . The energy he employed could not have sent him more than a hundred years ... forward or back in time - probably less . - Ann , reduce your limits . - [ Clark ] Only a hundred years forward or back . - Ann , reduce your limits . - [ Clark ] Only a hundred years forward or back . That means you have to pinpoint him across 200 years . 200 years is just a heartbeat ... compared to the countless billions of years of time . Yes , I suppose so . Well , what happens if you find him ? Tony and his immediate environment will be relayed into the Tunnel 's recorders ... and reproduced instantly on the image area . - You mean we 'll be able to see him ? - See and hear him . - Would he be able to see us ? - No , but he 'll know what we 're trying to do . He might communicate with us on the assumption that we 've found him . [ Oscillating ] - Ray . - I know , Doug . I 'm beginning to get some irregular coordination . G , ' [ Tones Chiming ] Sounds like bells . ♪ ♪ [ Chiming ] - Captain . - Good afternoon . Captain , I must speak to you . It 's very important . Yes , of course . You 're , uh - You 're Mr. - My name is Newman , sir , but that doesn 't matter . Captain , I must tell you something . Yes , of course , Mr. Newman . What did you want to say ? I don 't know how to say it without sounding like I 'm out of my mind . Come , come , my dear fellow . You 're dissatisfied with your accommodations ... or the food or - or perhaps you 've misplaced something and you 're afraid it 's been stolen . - In any case , I assure you - - Captain , this ship is the Titanic . Is that what you had to tell me ? What I mean , sir , is the Titanic sank . It struck an iceberg and was lost . Sank ? This is our maiden voyage , sir . That means our first voyage . I trust this is not some poor attempt at a practical joke . No , Captain , it 's not a joke . I swear to you . How can I make you understand ? Perhaps if you stopped talking nonsense , Mr. Newman . Newman . Newman . I don 't recall . Are you in second class or third ? I 'm not on the passenger list , Captain . I 'm Dr. Anthony Newman . My doctorate 's in electro-physics . It 's a very impressive title , Doctor . Listen , I know I sound insane , but you must believe me - for the sake of thousands of lives . I can 't remember the exact hour and day of the disaster , but it 's history . Stop this rubbish . We are riding on a calm sea . You talk about sinkings and disasters as though they 'd already happened . It has for me , Captain . I was born in 1938 . - If you insist . - Captain . I 'm part of a scientific team in the year 1968 . We 've been experimenting with time displacement . I 've been sent back in time to this ship - to this moment , month and year . Mr. Grainger , this gentleman is a confessed stowaway . Please see that he 's confined till we reach New York . Captain , you 'll never reach New York . I 'm afraid his peculiar ideas might alarm some of the other passengers . I suggest you keep him incommunicado and under guard . Yes , sir . All right . Even if you don 't believe me , it wouldn 't hurt you to change your course . - Go farther south . - Take him below . Captain ! Not reach New York ? Change our course ? What sort of gibberish was that , sir ? Well , I make him some sort of harmless crank , Mr. Grainger . But there are other transatlantic lines ... which would not like to see us set a record on our maiden run . I can 't believe they 'd go to these lengths , but - - Well , I think that 'll be all , Mr. Grainger . - Aye , aye , sir . - Oh , Mr. Grainger . - Sir . - Wire for further information on iceberg movements , will you . - We did , this morning , sir . - Well , confirm them . - Aye , aye , sir . [ Electronic Warbling ] [ Flipping Switches ] - Look . - [ Oscillating ] [ Ship 's Horn Blows ] Ray , we need some pressure magnification . A ship that size - it couldn 't have been too long ago . Anybody recognize it ? I do . I 'd know those lines anywhere . Gentlemen , that 's the Titanic . - A picture of the Titanic . - No , not a picture . It is the Titanic . Then Tony must be on board . When did the Titanic go down ? Ann , get the boys on the history computer to give us a complete rundown on the Titanic ... with pictures and cross-section diagrams . I want tonnage , speed , equipment - the works . Also , the year , day and minute she went down . But Dr. Newman is alive now , in our time . How could he be affected by something that 's happening at the beginning of the century ? No . He 's living in that time zone now . Anything that happens to us won 't affect him there ... but if he 's on that ship when it goes down ... he 'll die along with the others . - Just a few minutes , ma 'am . - Thank you . - How did you find me ? - I just spoke to the captain . Is it true that you 're a stowaway ? In a sense , yes . And that you 're trying to alarm passengers with - with wild stories of the ship 's safety ? Althea , do you have the time - the exact time ? - Is-Is that important to you ? - Desperately important . It 's exactly six minutes past 10 : 00 in the evening . Oh . What are you doing ? There 's so much to explain . I don 't know where to begin . Well , tell me . Why are you behaving like this ? Do you know , it 's been a peaceful trip up till now . And then , out of nowhere , you - - Well , I don 't understand . - I know you don 't . I 've just begun to realize how stupid I am to think anybody could possibly understand . Would you let me try ? - I 'm glad you were concerned enough to ask about me . - Oh . Althea , do you believe in the future ? I mean , that there really is a future for you , your children , mankind ? Yes , of course I do . And obviously you believe in the past . Everybody does . But what if I were to tell you that the past and the future are the same ? - You think I 'm raving . - No , no . I don 't . I don 't blame you . Suppose I told you that time itself doesn 't exist . It 's only motion we measure - the motion of the Earth spinning ... the orbit of the Earth around the sun . - Tony , I 'm sorry . - Oh , no , no . I 'm the one who 's sorry . I frightened you . You see , all I wanted to do was for you to let me help you . [ Knocking ] Sorry , ma 'am . Captain said just a few minutes was all . Oh . I 'm just coming . Thank you . Look , uh , why don 't you let me tell the captain that you didn 't mean what you said ... and that you won 't mention it again , hmm ? I can 't promise that , Althea ... not when I know what 's going to happen . But you don 't know . Nobody knows . You can 't . [ Pounding ] [ Panting ] That 's it . Hold those coordinates . [ Man ] The captain said to keep you quiet . If that means using chains , Mister , I have them too . Doug ! I don 't know if you 're picking me up . If you 're just getting sound , I 'm on the Titanic ... locked in a forward cabin just above the waterline . He 's a prisoner . It 's 9 : 75 a.m. , April 74 , 7972 . I don 't know when it 's gonna sink , but - They 've got me locked up ... because I tried to warn the captain . He 's right in the middle of the section that was slashed open by that iceberg . - What about the date ? - Let 's see - " The Titanic struck an iceberg late on Sunday evening , April 14 ... and sank during the early hours of Monday , April 15 . " - Then he 's got about 14 hours . - Fourteen hours . No , he hasn 't , Senator . Tony 's locked in a room that could be flooded as soon as they hit that berg . No . We 're the ones that have 14 hours if we 're going to try and save him . Well , what can you do ? Theoretically , we can suspend Tony in his time zone and remove him from it . But , during that suspension , Tony 's body processes - his heart , his breathing , his tissue regeneration - would all stop . Unless we can return him here or to some other time zone within seconds ... we 'll kill him . - That 's what you 're thinking , isn 't it ? - Not exactly . There were over 300 men who summed the Titanic . Tony knows what will happen . If he were free , he could be one of those survivors . Yes , but we can 't free him by remote control . - No , but we could go back and help him . - Doug , no . Yesterday , you refused to let Tony do what he went and did anyway , and you were right . What do you expect to do now except die with him ? What do you suggest ? We just sit here and watch him die ? At least my way he 'd have a chance . Now , remember , I 'll appear there dressed for the period and prepared with the facts . That reminds me . Have Research get me a copy of a New York paper dated April 15,1912 . Doug , you and I have worked together long enough for you to know ... that I don 't give orders just to play soldier . I know that , Woody . But , just this once , it might be the right thing to do . Now , we have a friend that 's in danger . You 're trying to protect me from that danger . I appreciate that . But if Tony weren 't back there , this research would have come to a close . Isn 't that true ? All right . Tony 's risking his life to succeed where I failed . If we don 't have the faith in what we 're doing here ... and the guts to back up that faith - Woody , Dr. Newman took off on his own like a madman . If you let this man go , it 's a cold-blooded responsibility ... you might have to live with the rest of your life . Would you let me go if our positions were reversed ? Probably not . I turned Tony down . But I 'm hoping you 're tougher than I am . Prepare your briefing procedure . I 'll organize a countdown . - Good luck , Doug . - It 'll work , Senator . Doug , your master guidance control has been programmed ... for an identical overlay with Tony 's . If you overshoot me a day or more , I 'll get there before Tony . Or a day late , and you wind up ... in the freezing waters where the ship sank with Tony on it . Doug , please . Don 't go . I have to . Ray , you 'll be calling the scientific shots from this end . Don 't gamble unless you have to . But if you do have to , go for broke . Don 't worry . [ George ] Sixteen , 75 , 74 ... 13 , 12 ... 11 , 10 , nine ... eight , seven , six , five , four ... three , two , one , zero . Hey now ! Where 'd you come from ? I 'm sorry . I guess I should get back where I belong . Guess you should . Tourist . Oh . It 's all right . Come on in . Anything wrong , son ? - Oh , excuse me , sir . - It 's all right . I 'm just washing up . Ah . You didn 't happen to see a little French boy ... with his pockets bulging with food , did you ? - Did you say food ? - Yes , sir . His parents are immigrants in the third class . He 's been raiding the dining room tables in the first class for leftovers . Not that we blame the little fella , sir . But , if you allow one , they 'll all descend on you , if you know what I mean , sir . - Of course . - The little fella seems to have given me the slip . He 's a clever little tyke , you know . - Now , who left this about ? - That 's mine . Thank you . Oh , I see , sir . Carry on . - It 's all clear . - Merci , monsieur . Merci bien ! Oh , you 're very welcome . What 's your name , young man ? Marcel . Marcel Corbeau . Well , I 'm Dr. Phillips . It 's a pleasure to meet you , Marcel . Say , I 'm looking for a friend of mine . He 's supposed to be locked up somewhere in the third-class area . - Would you know anything about him ? - Friend ? - An American . - Ah ! Oui , oui , monsieur . The Américain . - Good . You think you could take me to him ? - Our ' . Come with me . - Maybe you and I could figure out some way to get in to see him . - Oui , oui . Here ! Don 't fool with that ! Tony . Hey , Tony - Doug . - Are you all right ? That radiation gimmick of yours was great , Tony . We were able to home right in on you . I could even pick up the sound of your voice right through those bulkheads . And I was able to pick this point in time exactly . You were out of your mind to come here . [ Tony ] Now we 're both stuck on the ship . Leroy . Leroy ! Somethings coming through . [ Doug ] No , we 're not . I have this . The guards coming back . They 're together ! Ann , regulate the probe for 50 % less radiation absorption . Ann , regulate the probe for 50 % less radiation absorption . It 's no good . The captain won 't believe it . He thinks I 'm some kind of conspirator already . He 'll say I had it printed . Why did you come here ? Well , I had to . Oh , you would have done the same for me . - But you know this ship is gonna sink tonight . - Maybe not . Doug , they won 't listen , I tell you . I have tried . Tony , what if we were to get in to the ship 's wireless , take it over ? What if we were to wire for help before the collision ? - There 'd be no Titanic disaster . - Exactly . Well , You 're not afraid to try , are you ? The first thing we have to do is take care of that guard out there . Well , all right . He thinks you 're in here alone . Make some noise . Let me outta this place ! You hear me ? I said let me out , or I 'll break a hole in this tub ! What the devil - You 're asking for it , all right . I Typing ] Good afternoon , gentlemen . May I , uh , help you ? [ Pounding Continues ] The Dutch liner 's picked up our C.Q.D. [ Tapping Morse Code ] Get away from there ! Stop him ! What on earth ? So , it 's you . I see you have a confederate . - They were using the wireless , sir . - What ? This is no longer a prank . You are in serious trouble . I promise you that . I know you didn 't believe my friend here , and you won 't believe me . But you can believe your own eyes . This ship will strike an iceberg at 77 : 40 tonight and go down . - The story 's all here in tomorrow 's paper . - Take them below . And this time , see that they stay there . Captain , you 've got to believe me ! Captain , we 're getting calls from many ships ... requesting our position and the nature of our distress . Tell them to disregard all distress signals from this ship . - We are in good order and safely underway . - Aye , sir . [ Ship 's Horn Blowing ] G , ' [ Piano Ragtime ] Oh , thank you . [ Crash ] - Come with me , Mr. Grainger . - Aye , sir . [ Tunnel Oscillating ] - Would you wait outside for a moment , Mr. Grainger . - Aye , aye sir . We have hit an iceberg , just as the two of you predicted . Now , how could you have known ? Captain , the only explanation is the truth . You see , we come from the year 7968 . We 've traveled back through time to this moment . What 's happening here is history to us . My reasoning cannot accept that . In any case , when we repair damage and reach New York ... perhaps a maritime inquiry can fathom your story . Captain , your ship is going down . That is impossible . This ship is unsinkable . This ship is dead , and so is everyone on board ... unless you give immediate orders to lower the lifeboats ! Captain , we 've warned you of the collision . Please believe us about this . What have you got to lose ? Order those lifeboats away . [ Loud Crash ] - Mr. Grainger . - Sir . Order the crew to begin " abandon ship " procedure . - Abandon ship , sir ? But - - Do as I say . Aye , aye , sir . Very well , gentlemen . With more than 2,300 souls on board ... I cannot afford to ignore even the remotest possibility . Your lifeboats will only hold about 750 . How did you know that ? Well , despite the fact that this ship was built and advertised ... as the vessel that could not be sunk ... your life-saving equipment is insufficient and inadequate . Are you telling me that only 750 will survive ? Yes , sir . I see . My mind will not let me believe you . But I do believe in a God , gentlemen . If what you say is true , then only the fact that you were here ... will save those who do survive . I would have to consider that a miracle of God 's mercy . In a way , sir , perhaps it is . Captain , do you think maybe we could all be of more help on the decks ? Yes . Yes , of course . It occurs to me now you may even know whether I will die tonight . Yes , sir , I 'm afraid you will . - [ Tunnel Oscillating ] - [ Loud Crash ] [ Men Shouting ] You don 't know that you can remove them from their present time zone . You might just kill them yourself . What 's our choice , General , to let them die with that ship ? Even if you do remove them , you won 't have any control after that . They 'd disappear in time ... to any moment in the billions of years of the past or future . Is that any worse than condemning them to certain death aboard the Titanic ? I wonder . Check the lifeboats on the upper deck . I 'll see below . Right . [ Shouting , Screaming ] [ Woman ] Help ! Help ! - Mr. Thomas . - Sir . Only women and children are allowed in the lifeboats . - That order is not to be violated . - Aye , aye , sir . - Mr. Martin . - Sir ! - Advise the boiler room to evacuate immediately . - Aye , aye , sir . - Mr. Williams . - Sir . - Assign six seamen to assist the passengers in steerage . - Aye , aye , sir . [ Shouting , Screaming ] - [ Loud Crashing ] - [ Shouting , Screaming ] [ Shouting , Screaming ] Hey ! Althea . What are you doing ? The ship is sinking . - It doesn 't matter for me . - [ Loud Crash ] - Althea . - No , Tony . You don 't understand . I 've no right to take a place on one of those lifeboats . I 'm not a rich girl on holiday . I 'm just an ordinary schoolteacher . I spent the last penny of my savings for this trip . What difference does that make ? The difference is I 'm going to die soon anyway . - What are you talking about ? - I 'm ... ill . There-There 's a growth inside my head . it 's just a matter of months . - Are you sure ? - My doctor in London is sure . He said there 's a doctor in New York who 's working on a new type of brain operation . It 's called ... neurosurgery , I think . But it 's just a matter of months . - There 's really no hope . - Of course there is . Neurosurgery is not a fad , and it 's not hopeless . Althea , some brain operations have become as commonplace as taking out tonsils . - Become ? - Althea , you 'll just have to trust me . The chances that you can be helped are probably much better than you think . Are you a doctor too ? No , I am not a doctor , and you 've no right to play God . I 'm not even attempting to play God . You 're deciding when it 's time for you to live or die . You don 't have that right . You are asking me to believe in miracles . I am asking you to believe in life , not death , . Althea , please , believe in me . - [ Sh / pk Horn Blowing ] - [ Shouting , Screaming ] - [ Sh / pk Horn Blowing ] - [ Shouting , Screaming ] [ Electricity Crack / mg ] Marcel !

We 're going . Tony , there 's trouble on " A " Deck . Follow me . In a way , you 've created a monster . To have to stand here helplessly watching people die , it 's horrible ! There 's not much time . [ Passengers Clamoring ] [ Screaming ] Doug ! Tony ! - Freeze them ! - What happened to them ? They 're alive if the time transfer worked . - Well where ? - We don 't really know . - Can we establish any limits ? - Not with certainty . - [ Kirk ] Hurry ! They 're dying - Accelerate power . They 've been separated in time . Doug ? Doug ! Doug ! See who that is . Hold it right there , Mister . [ Gasping For Breath ] I 'm one of the men in charge of the station . You must be new here . I 'm Dr. Newman . I 'm back . I 've been here 14 months , Mister , and I never heard of any Dr. Newman . Fourteen months ? But I 've been here every day for the past seven years . Now what 's the problem , soldier ? Figs ? It is you , isn 't it ? I didn 't recognize you without the mustache . Jiggs , it 's me , Dr. Newman . Newman ? I never heard of any Newman around here . And , Mister , I never had a mustache . What are you talking about ? You know me - Tony Newman . Mister , I 've never seen you before in my life . They brought me back in the wrong time . He looks younger . And look at the license plate on that truck . Magnification . You brought him back 1 O years ago ! We didn 't . It just happened - a fluke . But if he 's this close - Ray , we 've got to close a ID-year-gap before we lose him . Well , why not just go out there ? You 'd see nothing . You 're in the present . That 's taking place 1 O years ago . - What 's the trouble here , Sergeant ? - Doug ! - They got you back too ! - You better get going , Doc . We got a weird one here . - It 's Phillips . - Yeah . Ten years ago . Newman was still in school then . He and Phillips hadn 't even met . Good Lord , can you imagine the nightmare Tony must be living through now ? - [ Kirk ] Ray can 't you do anything ? - Intensify the probe . [ whirring ] Well , You better see that he gets a ride back into towm , Jiggs . After what he 's seen ? He 'll have to answer a few questions for our security officer . Doug . Doug , wait . Tell him who I am . Doug , tell him who I am ! Doug , tell him who I am ! Doug ! Doug . Doug , wait ! - Wait ! Doug ! - On the double ! If he doesn 't stop , shoot him ! Tony 's broken loose ! He 's half out of his mind ! - We 'll need more time to try a return transfer . - He doesn 't have time ! He resists and those men may kill him . - Superimpose his signal with Doug 's . - We 'll lose him . At least the two of them will be together when we try a location probe . Doug ! Doug ! - [ Warning Shot Fired ] - Doug ! Doug ! The Tunnel 's gone blank . Well , we moved Tony from that time zone of 10 years ago . Well , wherever he and Doug are now ... at least they 're together . But where ? We couldn 't begin to guess . [ Computers whirring ] Leroy , Sergeant Jiggs will escort you to the surface . - A car 's waiting for you there . - Thanks , Woody . - Good-bye , Doctor . - Good-bye , Senator , and thank you very much , sir .

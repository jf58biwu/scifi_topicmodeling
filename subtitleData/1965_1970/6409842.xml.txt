 [ theme music plays ] [ restaurant hubbub , background music plays ] A moment . Don 't run away . My friend here , don 't let him dry out , huh . - Johnny . - Angie ! - How 've you been keeping ? - As if you didn 't know . Look , if you 're planning to make trouble- - - You know me . - That 's just it . Next time- - No , I had it coming to me , huh ? - That 's right . - Teach me my place . A woman , she should be in the home . Now I am worried . It 's all right . I learn my lesson . - So , what do you want ? - A home . Say , a lease on a nice house and Â£ 100 . - You 've got to be joking . - I 'd settle for 500 in cash . - What for ? - Chance of a lifetime . With that old soak ? What 's he got ? - It matters ? - No competition . I told you . I don 't want no more razors . Whoever fixed your face did a good job . - Give me a start , huh ? - I don 't know . What 's the angle ? Medical . I pay back double in two months . Hang around , I 'll see what I can do . - Sorry . - That 's all right . Some business . They look after you , huh ? - Um-hm . - Another ? - I wouldn 't say no . - Do you ever ? - It 's not that I want one . - I know . It 's a disease , drink , you know ... physiological . Stay with me . I give you all the drink in the world . Starting now . Thanks . - What 's your name ? - Angie Quiller . Roger Full . How do you do ? - I 've been thinking ... - What about ? - This . - Me also . [ clattering ] Sit up and look good , huh ? Don 't you take that tone with me , young lady . You 're addressing a member of the professional classes . Physicians have been respected members of the community for years . - I am a physician . - Once . And shall be again . With this . Oh , yes , I most certainly shall . One lapse . They 'll overlook that in a man - who brings this to the world . - A useless drunk . Physician heal thyself . I shall cure myself , of course . And after ? Half a dozen spectacular cures- - Are you mad ? You lay a finger on one patient , they 'll have you behind bars . - They won 't know . - Unless I tell them . Why would you do that ? Oh , for God 's sake ! Because I 've got a better idea . You want to prove something ? All right . Do it my way , you 'll get results . I 'll make money , and no trouble with police . - What are you talking about ? - Be quiet now , huh . It 's yours for a month . Make sure it pays off . And don 't say that I don 't look after you . You 're a lovely man . - What 's that ? - Capital . You and me , we do business . We are about to found the Full-Quiller Clinic . - I don 't understand . - You will . Come , we got work to do . - What 's the angle ? - Cosmetic surgery . Can 't say it sets me on fire . Hardly touches the bulk of our readers . That 's how he started . It seems he 's been branching out of late . He 's treated at least one patient for a tumour . - Malignant ? - I don 't know . Anyway , the point is he was struck off ten years ago . - What for ? - Killing a patient . - Really ? - He was drunk at the time . Yes , well , you may have something there , but these articles of yours are tailing off a bit . Look at where you 've been placing them . It 's a case of which comes first , ducky , isn 't it ? It 's your enthusiasm that keeps me going . All right , go ahead . See how it works out . But remember , we really need a strong finisher . You find out he is pushing some phoney cancer cure and I 'll go to town for you . You don 't want much , do you ? Increased circulation , that 's all . [ electronic whirring ] Hello Control , this is Supernormal 17- - [ Control ] Yes , Al ? I 'm getting a rather odd signal from bag number 67 4101 . That the one you lost to another timescale ? - Yes , that 's the one . - Well ? Well , last time I had anything like this , it was one of the kits being used for cosmetic purposes . We took a dim view , didn 't we ? Yes , that 's why I 'm querying it now . Of course , it 's not necessarily harmful . Depends where it is ... on the ethical climate . The signal 's intermittent , it 's not very strong . - This side of emergency ? - Yes , I 'd have thought so . All right , leave it on . Watch it though . Will do . Not a mark ! I don 't think you 'll have any further trouble . That 's wonderful . I 'll tell you , Doctor , when I came to you I had a good many doubts . Yes , people usually do . You see , before I came here , this specialist , as a matter of fact , told my wife it was malignant . I don 't think he 'll say that again . Surprising how people can slip up , isn 't it ? Supposed to be a top man , too . I can 't thank you enough , Doctor . You 've done a wonderful job . Very reasonably too , if I may say so . Now if there 's anything I can do , I mean , in the way of recommendation- - - Thank you . - Not at all . - Thank you , Doctor . - Good day . Thank you very much . Goodbye , Doctor . - Another satisfied customer . - Yes . What 's the matter ? - That growth . It was malignant . - Well ? - There 's not a trace of it now . - Good for you . I 'm beginning to wonder whether we 've got our priorities right . - How do you mean ? - All this cosmetic work when we could be doing something that really matters . You want to bite the hand that feeds you ? We 'd never have got started without cosmetic work . You couldn 't just put up a plate and go into general practice , could you ? - Not then , but- - - Miss Flannery , please . Look , I haven 't got time to stand and argue . There 's a waiting room full of patients . They 're quite happy with us as we are . But that 's hardly the point . Let 's talk about it some other time , huh ? Very well . - Miss Flannery ? - Doctor . Please . Now , then , Miss Flannery , what seems to be the trouble ? Well , I have this sort of nagging backache . - All the time . - More or less . But not just when you 're tired or- - - No , no , all the time . - I see . And how long has this been going on for ? Six months , I suppose . You 've consulted your own doctor , presumably ? - Yes . - And what did he do ? She . My doctor 's a woman . She gave me some liniment . - No good ? - No , none at all . - Did you go back to her ? - No . Yes , that 's the idea . There 's nothing to worry about . Quite relaxed . Twenty , 19 . Twenty , 20 . Twenty , 18 . Sixteen ... just a moment . Yes , 16 , 20 . You have a slightly over-active thyroid , Miss Flannery . Also there seems to be something wrong with your left lung . I don 't think it 's anything serious but I 'd like to take a closer look . Would you mind removing your blouse and lying face-down on the couch ? What are you going to do ? [ electric jingling ] You won 't mind if I blindfold you for the examination ? - Well- - - Thank you . That 's it . Thank you . Yes ... Don 't worry . [ high-pitched bleeping ] Yes , there 's an old tubercular scar down there . I don 't think it 's doing any particular harm , but a person of your constitution needs all the oxygen she can get . Now if you 'd like to lie just perfectly still , yes , right . I 'll fix it for you . Instrument nine ? Quite still . Good . - Now- - - I hope you know what- - Instrument 30 . After this I shall need three CCs of vascular glue . Good girl . Mmm-hm . Yes . There we are . - No harm done . - What ? I took out your fibrosis . A good friend it 's been to you too . It 's walled off the infection , so you 're still alive to tell the tale . - You did that ? Here ? - Yes . - But I didn 't feel anything . - And there 's no scar either . We may not be able to give you the security of conventional medicine , but there are advantages . I 've left your thyroid , you 're used to it . Besides , it will probably correct itself once you stop worrying about your job . As for the backache , if you have any further trouble , I would be inclined to see your own doctor again . She could be right , you know . Doctor , there are a lot of questions I want to ask- - Yes , I 'm sure , but I don 't give interviews . I have a lot of patients waiting for me . But what about my next appointment ? You 're cured . There 's nothing more I can do for you . Well , how much do I owe you ? Miss Quiller will take care of that . This way , please . - Oh , and Miss Flannery . - Yes ? Look out for quacks . The woods are full of them . - What were you trying to do ? - An experiment . Well , don 't do it again . You practically gave me heart failure , mucking about like that . - You could have killed her . - But I didn 't . - I cured her lung condition . - More by luck than judgement . Don 't you see ? If you follow the instructions and set the instruments correctly , you can 't go wrong . All right . So we got away with it that time . What 's the point ? I 'm beginning to think , with this , we can do anything . - Cure anything . - That 's no reason - to chance your arm . - But it is . We must find out . I need to find out . - But to go and operate on her . - She was sick . You don 't know who she is . That 's what I mean . She could be anyone , a snooper or anything . - She 's a journalist . - How do you know ? Well , I read the papers . She 's a household name , specialises in 'dramatic exposures ' . - And you carved her up ? - Why not ? With your record ? Here ? You gone mad ? Given enough publicity , we may be able to practice real medicine again . What 's the matter with you ? We 've got a nice little thing going- - But what possible harm could she do ? She can put you in prison and me back in the gutter . [ Miss Flannery ] And after that he put these discs all over me . Made out he was getting readings from some dial . - Wonderful ! - You 've never seen such hokum . Then he blindfolded me . Fiddled about for a bit with some equipment . When he took the bandages off , he told me he 'd removed the fibrosis you diagnosed . - No ! - And I hadn 't felt a thing . I mean , there wasn 't even a trace of a scar . And how much did this performance cost ? Fifty guineas . You asked for a receipt , I hope . Oh yes , a detailed receipt . Well , you 've got to give them full marks for gall . And yet in spite of all that mumbo-jumbo , there was something extraordinarily impressive about him . Oh , these confidence tricksters can be very convincing . That 's how they make their living . Oh , I know . I 've met enough since I started this series but- - Yes ? This was the first time I got the feeling that , well , it was almost as if he believed what he was saying . I don 't doubt some of them fool themselves , too . No , I 'm putting it very badly . It 's hard to explain . He didn 't seem to be trying to impress me , somehow . It 's very odd . Well , let 's judge by results , shall we ? Ah , thank you . If this shows what it must , I think you 'll really be able to wax indignant - in your final article . - And how ! - Good God ! - What is it ? [ nurse ] Yes ? Nurse , that plate you just brought in . You 're sure , it 's the one we took of Miss Flannery ? - Yes , why ? - You couldn 't possibly have confused it with another patient 's ? No . I developed it myself , brought it straight in . Is there something wrong ? I just want to make sure . That 's all . - It 's not possible ! - What 's wrong ? You remember my showing you the fibrosis on that first plate we took ? - That 's it , isn 't it ? - Yes , there . Clear as a bell . Now look at this new one . - It 's not there . - Not a sign of it . Spontaneous remission ? ln the time ? Or in a condition as advanced as that ? I 've never known it happen before . Then what does it mean ? There must be some logical explanation . - What ? - I haven 't the faintest idea . - Then , whatever he did- - - It just doesn 't make sense . It makes a hell of a story , doesn 't it ? You are sure ? No question . Your lung 's clear . Here ... for you . Angie , we can 't go on like this . Like what ? Running a beauty parlour , more or less . What we 've got here ... I 'm not even sure it should be in private hands . Medicine belongs to the world . Yes , I know , it may sound corny- - What has the world has ever done for us ? But it happens to be what I believe . You know what you are ? Ungrateful . - Squandering it like this . - We 're doing all right . But we haven 't even begun to explore its full potential . It 's ours . Ours ! We came on it by chance and we 've cashed in on it for ages . - And why not ? - But we 've no right to keep it to ourselves . There are people who need it . Really need it . People who are sick . - Don 't give me that mush . - We owe it to humanity . And what about me ? Don 't you owe me anything ? Well , yes , yes- - You just remember what you were when I met you . Struck off . A lush . And look at you now . Who have you got to thank for that ? This cured me . When I put a roof over your head ! Cleaned you up . Clothed you . If it hadn 't been for me you wouldn 't be here . You 'd have lost that by now , if you hadn 't pawned it . - Well , wouldn 't you ? - Probably . Who put you back on the map ? Who showed you how to use that ? - You did . - That 's right . And you think I 'm going to let you throw all that away ? Just because you want to be a ' proper ' doctor ? - Where did that ever get you ? - All right , all right ! Perhaps they won 't allow me to use it . No ! If we could give it to the ... The BMA ? The Royal College- - - They 'll give you a medal . - It could be of some real good . And what I am supposed to do for a living while you walk around in a holy glow ? I told you , we 'll think of something . - What ? - I don 't know . You see ? I tell you , let that out of our sight and we are done . Finished ! But if Edna Flannery gives us the right kind of publicity- - You can count that out for a start . I cured her , didn 't I ? What does she say ? - Nothing . - But- - They shut her up . Finished the series . There 's nothing . Of course ... I don 't know about ' of course ' . It 's obvious , isn 't it ? A quack who kills or maims , well , ah , yes , that 's news . People want to read about that . But one who actually heals people ... They don 't want to know . They don 't want to read about it . It 's no story . And a good job , too , if you ask me . If she 'd only just told the truth ... Yes , well , she didn 't even get the chance , so let 's forget it , huh . Oh , come on . It 's not the end of the world . We 're not doing any harm are we ? We 're not doing so bad . You 're tired , that 's what it is . Tell you what , let 's shut up shop for the day . Have a drink , go and get a slap-up lunch somewhere . I 'll pay . And after we could ... Well , go back to my place , if you like . And ... what do you say ? We 've earned ourselves a bit of fun , haven 't we ? Thank you . I 've got to see somebody . - Who ? - See you later . [ loudly ] Who ? [ knocking ] - Doctor Kelland ? - Yes ? I 'm terribly sorry but there 's someone to see you . - Tell them I 'm busy . - I have . He insists it 's urgent . He won 't go away . - Won 't ? - It 's a Mr. Full . That rings a ... Yes , show him in . Give me a minute . Get rid of this , then show him in , will you ? Yes . All right . Mr. Full , sir . - Mr. Kelland . - Yes ? - I 'm Roger Full . - Dr. Full ? Thank you . I treated your patient , Miss Flannery . - So I understand . - I cured her . - Possibly . - Didn 't I ? Her condition appears to have improved since seeing you , certainly . On the other hand you 're no longer qualified . - I came- - - As a former doctor , you must know that I 'm not allowed to consort with a doctor who has been struck off . Even for the good of your patient ? Under any circumstances . Yes , well , as a matter of fact , that 's why I came to see you . I came into possession of a medical bag . The instruments are different from the ones we are used to and ... - ... there 's a date on the bag . - What date ? 2160 . - It could be a patent number . - No , July , 2160 . - How did you come by this bag ? - I found it . I don 't understand , but it works . Well , you 've seen the results . It has , well , miraculous properties . How does it work ? There 's a sort of Diagnostic Card with instructions . If you follow them , it works . Well , you 've seen for yourself . - Where did it come from ? - Well , I don 't know . It sort of materialized . Perhaps some young inventor has found out how to break the timescale . It all sounds a little far fetched- - Well , of course it does . That 's why I 've got to demonstrate it . You do realise that if it does work , we 'll probably take it away from you ? - Yes . - You don 't mind ? Yes , I mind . But it 's too much , too great a responsibility ... for one man to keep to himself . Too great a privilege . All right . I 'll see what I can do , talk to my colleagues . I might be able to persuade them to allow you to carry out an experiment - under clinical conditions . - Thank you . I can 't guarantee it , but I must insist on one proviso . - But of course , anything . - If I 'm to do this , you must undertake not to use the equipment meanwhile . - I 've got myself to think of . - Of course . It 's one thing to arrange a demonstration for you . I can 't consort with an unqualified practitioner . - Yes . - So no more cosmetic surgery . No more experiments of any kind , or I wash my hands of you . - Agreed ? - Agreed . ln fact , you 'd better hand over this ... this bag to the Royal College for safe keeping . Then I 'll see what I can organise - and be in touch with you . - Thank you . - Welcome home . - Thank you . - About time . - I 've got some great news . - It 'll have to keep . - Our troubles are almost over . There 's a patient waiting for you . Cosmetic ? - What else ? - No , not now . - Why ? - Because it 's an abuse . Listen , she 's loaded . We have a chance to show what we can really do . She 's ready to part with good money to lose the bags under her eyes . No , I can 't . It won 't take you five minutes . But don 't you understand ? There are people who are really suffering . What makes you think she isn 't ? I tell you , I 'd be suffering if I looked like her . Oh , now , Angie , Angie ... You can 't disappoint a pathetic , old woman , can you ? All right . But this is the last time . Understood ? If you say so . Mrs. Coleman , please . Mrs. Coleman , Doctor . Miss Quiller 's told me so much about you . Yes , I 'm sure . Lie down , please . Thank you . I hope your system is permanent . It is . Right there . Thank you very much . Still . Put the retractors in as I cut . [ Angie shushing ] [ spraying ] - It 's not going to hurt , is it ? - No . Lie back . You know what to do . [ sonic humming ] Right . [ equipment rattling ] That 's it . And again . Ready ? That feels peculiar . Are you sure you 're rubbing it properly ? Try not to talk during the massage . [ clinking ] [ spraying ] - Get her out . - There we are . - Have you finished ? - All done . But ... you 've hardly done anything , surely ? Come and see . There 's a mirror out in the hall . [ Miss Coleman ] Oh ! But that 's wonderful . Simply wonderful ! Two hundred guineas for that . Not bad , is it ? Money for old rope . She wants her chins fixed tomorrow . You realise we could go over her an inch at a time , at 200 guineas an inch . Angie , we can 't keep this up forever . Let 's talk about it some other time . I 'm tired now . I went to see Mr. Kelland today . - Who is he ? - He 's Edna Flannery 's surgeon . He 's going to arrange a proper demonstration for us . - So what ? - But don 't you see ? We 'll have a chance to show what it can do . Find out how it works . Perhaps be able to manufacture kits like it . And what will we get out of it ? The advantage of knowing that it 's in proper hands . That it 's being used to its full potential . - That will pay the rent ? - Perhaps not , but- - And suppose they don 't believe in it ? - Well , why shouldn 't they ? - Lots of reasons . Because they don 't understand it , because it might make a lot of them redundant . Oh , now , Angie . Come on . All right ! Let them have a look at it , if you must . That 's no reason for us to stop using it . If we don 't they won 't touch it . And I 've agreed . You 've what ? I 'm not going on . That 's all . I 've had enough . Quite decided . You 've got a gall . We 're partners , aren 't we ? I 've got some say in it . Just because you got all aerated ... - All my life I 've had it rough . - I know . You know ? What do you know about anything ? You had it made , didn 't you ? Posh home , posh house . Medical School . Profession . And what did you do with it ? Me ? I didn 't have nothing . Only this idea that ... And , my God , I had to fight for it . And then , one day , I get this on a plate . You ... You didn 't know what to do with it . I did . I knew . And I 've got everything I ever wanted . You think I 'm going to stand by and let you just chuck that away ? - Poor Angie . - Don 't say it . Don 't say it or you 'll be sorry . Angie , there was a family once . They invented the OB forceps . They were greedy too . They kept them from the world for years . They knew what they were doing . And they were wrong . My mind is made up . I 'm going to hand these instruments over to the Royal College . Angie . [ clattering , high-pitched ringing ] Now look what you 've done . A stupid , selfish tantrum . [ gasps ] [ sonic ticking ] [ buzzer ] This is Supernormal 17 . This is an emergency . [ Control ] Let 's have it , Al . It looks as if there 's been a murder committed with Bag Number 764101 . Isn 't that the one you were supposed - to keep under surveillance ? - Yes . Is Supernormal Number 18 there ? Here . Number 17 is suspended from duty forthwith . You will be responsible for his appearance before the Tribunal . Verify the timescale and kill that bag ! Zero out . Massage ? My dear girl , what Dr. Full did to me yesterday , not that I 'm complaining , you understand . But whatever he did it was not massage . - No , well , you- - - It neither felt like it- - - If you 'll just- - - Cut . I distinctly remember him using the word ' cut ' . With this ? Why not ? Look . You see ? It simply slips beneath the tissues , tightening and firming the muscles themselves . So much easier than having to work through layers of skin and adipose tissue . It 's quite harmless . Comfortable too . [ steady beeping ] One murder , two murders . What 's the difference ? For you . That 's no reason why I should let them discipline me for disobeying orders . Let me see you do that with your neck . [ Control ] Kill that bag ! [ echoing ] [ loud whirring ] [ screaming ]

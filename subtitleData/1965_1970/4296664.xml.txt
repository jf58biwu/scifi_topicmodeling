 - [ Gunfire ] - [ Shouting ] Hey , look ! Tony ! Come on ! [ Doug ] Tony , over here . ! - British and Arabs fighting . - Middle East or North Africa . Judging from their clothing and weapons ... I 'd say it was late 1 9th or early 20th century . Whatever the time or place , it 's desert . We 'd better help ourself to some water and weapons . Come on . We 'd better get out of here ! The traffic 's too heavy ! What is that ? Whoever he is , he 's got company . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? What we are does not matter . We are here to destroy you . Follow him ! Move ! - They 're gonna kill them ! - Can you retrieve ? - Not without bringing the four of them back . - All right , then bring them . Keep on moving ! - Keep moving ! - [ Male Voice ] Stop . ! Wait a minute ! Wait . Something 's happening there . [ Male Voice ] Do not destroy the Earthlings . Bring them here to me . You heard the leader . Come with us . They separated . Can you retrieve now ? We 'll try . Lock in your signals . Signals locked . Ready to retrieve . Retrieve ! - What happened ? - I don 't know . Look ! You of the Time Tunnel ... listen and listen well . I know that you were trying to save the two time travelers who havejust arrived . Do not attempt to move them again ... or to interfere with us in any way for the next two hours . If you do ... you shall be destroyed . [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . Who are you ? Where are you speaking from ? There is no time for your infantile questioning . You have heard our demands . You will obey them . Try to get it back ! Nothing responds . Our power 's gone . What was the last fix we had on Tony and Doug ? Latitude : 1 6 degrees south . Longitude : 3 230 east . - They fell into the Sudan , North Central Africa . - Time period ? November 2 , 1 883 . Those creatures we saw didn 't exist in the 1 9th century . Try telling that to Tony and Doug . Ray , see about restoring power . Quickly . General , that threat he made - Hands off for two hours , or we 'll be destroyed . Forget it ! We 've got to get Tony and Doug out of there fast ! Stop . - Here ? Why ? - We have reached our destination . They 're probably gonna take us inside that mountain . Well , at least we 'll be in the shade . Stop , or you 'll die . A force field . A couple more steps , and you 'd have had it . - [ Alien Laughs ] - What now ? [ High-frequency Signal Beeping ] So that 's where the force field comes from . Follow me . Proceed ! Why are we here ? My leader drew this time and place by lot . Now move ! Back up . [ Signal Beeping ] Stop ! Bring them here . What is all this ? Who are you ? I will answer you in your ridiculous tongue ... so that there will be no possibility of any misunderstanding . I come from the planet Aristos . I have been assigned to conquer this planet ... during the time period known on your Earth ... as the year 1 883 . Of course . 1 883 . The Battle of Khartoum . The British and the Arabs . What does that miserable little skirmish have to do with you ? It has a great deal to do with you . There 's a large number of British troops out there . There 's a good chance this complex of yours will be overrun by them . I hardly think so . Perhaps you should see the extent of it . As you can see , we are well armed . In two of your Earth hours , our first missiles will be ready to fire . They will hit London , the major capital of your world . Your planet will be surrendered 2 4 hours after the first attack . Why ? What are you after ? Conquest of the galaxy . A task set for me by the elders to prove my ability to be a prince of Aristos . You mean , it 's a test ? A game ? And for that , you would kill millions of our people ? [ Chuckles ] Whether humans live or die is not important . All that matters is how you can serve me . Take this one out to the desert . Put a dehydration setting on your weapon . It will appear as if you died of thirst ... in the event you were found by any humans in the area . Take him away . Put that one in the extractor . [ Device Whirring ] It will do you no good to struggle . You 're being held there by a magnetic force . We can hold you there indefinitely . [ Panting ] What are you gonna do with me ? Your Time Tunnel - It operates on a different principle than ours . - It fascinates me . - What 's that got to do with this ? This is a mind-reading device . With it , I intend to extract from your brain ... all the knowledge it possesses about your time travel . - And then ? - Oh , then it won 't matter . Once I have emptied your mind , you will be dead . How much longer is it gonna be ? We 're trying to connect up with the main emergency generators now , General . It should only be a few minutes more . I know I don 't have to tell you , Ray , but please try to hurry it up . Ann , that date - November 2 , 1 883 . Have you checked it out ? Yes . That 's the day the Arabs attacked the British in the city of Khartoum . What in blazes can that have to do with the mess Tony and Doug are in ? - I think we 're all set , General . - Fine . What about you , Ann ? Yes . Identical coordinates and time spatial fix as before . All right . Let 's try it . - Well , where 's Doug ? Anybody see him ? - No . We haven 't been able to get a fix on him at all . - Should we try to pick up Tony ? - No , we can 't . The quadrants still overlap . - We might pick up that alien as well . - Then we may have to . Down there . [ Gunshot ] - Stand right where you are ! - Wait a minute . I 'm not the enemy . Sergeant , if he moves , shoot him . Put your hands over your head . - Look , give me a chance to - - Shut up ! Sergeant - - Will you give me a chance to explain ? - Shut up ! Sergeant , search him . It may please you to know you did your job very well . The Arabs wiped out my detachment back there . - What 's that got to do with me ? - I know who you are . Arab spies-you and your companion . It was an alien from another planet . He was trying to kill me . Alien indeed . A filthy desert killer is what he is ... disguised as you are in that ridiculous outfit . Arab equipment . That 's all the proof I need . Sergeant , take this along as evidence . If you don 't listen to me , you 're gonna lose a lot more than your detachment . Of all the cheek - How dare you threaten me ! I 'm not threatening you ! I 'm telling you facts ! Look , the first thing that 's gonna happen is that your entire army ... en route to Khartoum is gonna be wiped out , and that could happen any minute now ! Another ambush set up by you and the Arabs ? And the second thing is that there 's a base in this desert ... that 's gonna launch an attack on the cities of this world ... and London is gonna be first . ! And who 's manning this base ? More of your Arabs , I presume ? I told you , they 're not from this world . - Oh ! - Look . Look , I know it 's hard to believe . Your mastery of understatement is phenomenal . I 'm taking you along with me to Khartoum . Now move out ! Go on ! Watch him . - Move on . - Come on , men ! Let 's go ! Whoa . The Arabs are attacking . ! You knew what was going to happen down there , didn 't you ? - I tried to warn you . - But it 's too late to warn them ! The cream of our troops destroyed because of you ! You 're responsible ! I 'll give you 1 0 seconds to tell me the location of that Arab headquarters . You talk , or I 'll blow your head off ! . You have five seconds left . Do you tell me where that Arab force is located ... or do I kill you ? I 'll do even better , Captain . I 'll take you to the place where the people are who plan to destroy you . - Is this another trap ? - You 're laying down the rules of this little game . Either you trust me to lead you there , or you kill me here and now ... and never find out where it is . Very well . Lead on . Remember , one false move - I know . My life won 't be worth a plugged nickel . All right , lead on . He 's leading those British soldiers back to the aliens ' headquarters . Of course . He has to convince the British captain they exist . And I know he 's going to try and save Doug . Is there any way we can get a fix on Doug ? I 'm running tapes now . We should have an approximate fix on the alien area . - Good . We have no idea what kind of trouble Doug may be in . - There . Because your friend has momentarily eluded us ... please have no false hopes . There is no possibility of escaping . [ Chuckles ] Maybe not . But it won 't do you any good . There 's nothing you can get out of me that 'll help you . If so , nothing 's been lost except your life . - Are we ready to proceed ? - Yes . - The brain machine is ready . - Activate . [ Whirring ] Transcribe his mind . - Can 't you get a lock on that ? - We 're trying , General . What are they doing to him ? Looks like some kind of medieval torture . Futuristic torture , more likely . There , there ! There , you 're getting it . Can you retrieve him now ? We only have half power . I don 't know what will happen if we try it . Oh , we can 't let them continue . - Let 's try to get him out . - She 's right . Go after him . All right , Ann . Lock in your signals . Signals locked . Ready to retrieve . Retrieve ! So far , he is not responding . Increase the intensity . Here it is . It 's a lot of nonsense . There 's no Arab headquarters here . I told you I 'd take you to the spot where your real enemies are ... the ones who are planning to destroy the world . And they 're in there . - [ Whinnying ] - Doug ! You all right ? What happened ? The last thing I remember - Tony . Isn 't that the force field ? Time Tunnel ... must 've transferred me out of their machine . What is this mumbo jumbo ? And who are you ? The captain 's part of a detachment of the Khartoum troops . I 've been trying to convince him that we 're all in danger , and I haven 't had much luck . Nor will you have . I 've played along with you as far as I 'm going to . The two of you head back with me to Khartoum . Come on . No . Now , wait a minute . Captain , with the aid of that rock ... I believe I can convince you beyond a shadow of a doubt ... that we know what we 're talking about . Very well . Go ahead . There . Now , that should prove something to you ... unless you feel that the Arabs built that invisible force field out there . You make as little sense as the other one . And your bag of tricks convinces me of nothing . Now , on your way before - Hello . What are those things , and where did they come from ? Don 't be a fool ! Do you want them to kill us ? All right , Sergeant . Are those the people you spoke about ? No , they 're slave workers . Their masters are the ones who plan to attack London and destroy the world . With what ? With those ? No , they have power sources that you 've never dreamed of . If what you say is true - and , mind you , I 'm not yet accepting one word of it - what do you expect me to do about it ? Attack them . Destroy their base . And if you attack now , there may still be enough time . It may be too late . - What 's that ? - The aliens ! Take cover ! [ Gunshot ] Sergeant , over here ! [ Screams ] You were telling the truth . They must be beings from another planet . - They are . - Are they really going to attack London ? - In a few hours . - We 'd better retreat from here ... take up the matter with headquarters in Khartoum . I only hope they believe us . Come on . Ray , I can 't track . I can 't either . General ! What ? - What 's the matter ? - We don 't know . We 're holding our fix , but we can 't seem to track them . There 's your answer . You continue to interfere in spite of our warning . You humans have become most annoying . We are now going to take action against you . Why ? Those two men - the time travelers - they were sent there by mistake . They had no knowledge of your existence . He 's cut off our power . Better advise Security . Use my private tie-line . If you 're concerned , there 's a very simple answer . - Send our men back to us . - It is too late for that . Your control area has been sealed off . You will not be permitted to communicate with anyone else on your planet . The device you see has been activated . You have the 60 minutes indicated to accomplish our demands . Send all other personnel to the level just below the surface . If you comply , the others will be released . Otherwise , the device will destroy the Time Tunnel . We won 't abandon Tony and Doug . If you interfere again ... you will be killed immediately . Check that device for radioactivity . [ Whirring ] - What happened to him ? - Some kind of inverse laser burst . A protective screen to keep us from deactivating the device . - Well , can 't you neutralize it ? - No , General . Counteracting polarity screens might handle the laser effect ... but as for the device itself - SergeantJiggs ? SergeantJiggs . Why isn 't the red alert line to the Pentagon still open ? It cut off our communications . Unless we can find some way to get rid of this device ... we won 't have a chance . How much farther to Khartoum , Captain ? The fort at Shendi is just past that ridge ahead ... and Khartoum is another hour away . - Something wrong ? - A little matter of time , Captain . According to Doug , those aliens are gonna release their missiles in less than an hour from now . I 'd already thought of that . We 'll need a large force to overcome them in time . And there , gentlemen , you see our troops - our loyal native troops moving into advance position . They will occupy the entire area ... occupied by the alien complex . It 'll be a simple matter to convince the commander to attack . Good show , Captain . Shall we go down and join ' em ? [ Gunshot ] They 've ambushed the troops ! We must reach the column before they do . [ Shouting ] [ Gunfire Continues ] Still time to get there . Come on ! It 's too late . We 'll never make it now . They 've been routed . We 'd better fall back to Shendi with them . Hmm . It 's not even warm . Well , you 've neutralized the laser beam ... but whatever is inside there is still ticking away . We 've tried everything else , General . Why don 't we try attacking the aliens headquarters with a reverse energy burst ? It could backfire and destroy all of us . I know . But what other choices have we ? [ Sighs ] All right . Let 's hope it works . Build to full power . The moment after we make our reverse , I want an image . You 'll have it ... if we 're still here . - We 're at power . - General ? Reverse . - We got him ! - I don 't think so . I think his energy screen caught most of it . Look ! Your ingenuity ... amazes me . But by attacking us ... you have opened yourselves to complete retaliation . When the Androan device explodes ... all life within your Tunnel Complex will cease to exist . What can you hope to gain by that ? Your Time Tunnel - an excellent means for further conquest in other time periods . If you had cooperated , the lives of all the people in your Complex might have been spared . Cut him off . General , you 're - You 're not going to give up , are you ? Just let the aliens walk in and take over ? Do we have an alternative ? Unless we come up with a miracle in the next half hour ... we 're all going to die . Steady , men . Steady . Mind your feet . If that gun gets loose , you 'll cut off a man 's leg . All right , Sergeant , down through here . Make room for the recoil . Otherwise , we 'll lose on the very first shot . It 's almost certain the Arabs will be attacking on the Nile side . Bring your heavy pieces to bear on the bridge ! And fire at will . ! [ Shouting ] Some of you men , give us a hand to move this powder ! Come on , men ! Let 's go ! Hurry up with that powder ! There we go . - All right , now - - Sergeant major ! - Sir ! - Send another detail up those battlements ! - Get those Arabs off our walls ! - Is there anything else we can do ? Suit yourselves . You can stay or make a run for it . There 's the rear gate . Corporal . ! Tell the sergeant I want those guns concentrated on that gate . ! Well ? We 'll take our chances here . Good boys . You there , two rifles . Take cover ! [ Explosion ] Are you all right ? Captain , this fort is lost . There 's nothing more you can do here . All right . I 'll get the horses . Come on . Come on . Captain ! - Get those grenades right there . - All right . - One keg ought to be enough . - Come on ! We 've got to destroy those force field projectors somehow . You draw their attention over there . I 'll try to get close enough with these grenades . They got Tony . We still proceed , of course . We do . We can get to those mirrors from behind those rocks . Extractor . Your friend may have eluded us ... but you will suit our purpose just as well . See that the other two out there are disposed of . This time , we will not be interfered with . [ Device Whirring ] You 're defenseless against us ! You will discard your weapons and come out . Right on target ! Shall we discard the rest of our weapons ? Steady . One to go . Good show ! Let 's go . Activate . Catch . All right . All right , set him free ! I need only press this button , and your friend will cease to exist . And I need only pull this trigger , and you 'll cease to exist . [ Alien ] An interesting situation . We seem to have reached an impasse ... except that time is in my favor . In less than three minutes , our missiles will be launched against your world . At the same time , the people in your Time Tunnel will be destroyed . - What 's he talking about ? - He planted some kind of device in the Time Tunnel . One of those buttons set it off . General Kirk ! General Kirk , if you hear me , acknowledge ! Yes , Doug , I hear you . Is it true ? Can they destroy you ? I 'm afraid so . Their mechanism is set to explode in - - General , he 's gone . - [ Frequency Oscillating ] There 's a break in the transmission . - We 've run out of time . - Yes . I hate to think of what their advanced weaponry will do to this world . But there 's no way we can stand against it . Of course - the weaponry . We develop weapons that can destroy only our own kind ... so - Ann , prepare for transmission in exactly 30 seconds . Of course ! If it explodes there instead - You men , all of you , get that thing in the Tunnel . We 're gonna send their device back to them . Fifteen seconds and counting . General , what about Doug and Tony ? We 'll hold their signals on standby . If this works , we 'll retrieve when we rebuild power . - Ten , nine , eight , seven ... - All right , men , that 's far enough ! - Out . ! Everybody out . ! - six , five , four ... three , two , one . They 've saved themselves but destroyed your world ! Tony , they 've activated two of the missiles ! Let him go ! Come on ! Let 's get out of here ! - You 'll destroy us all ! - Let him go ! Come on ! Get out of here ! Captain ! [ Explosions ] It all seems like a horrible dream . We would never have succeeded if you two hadn 't come along . - What do you do now ? - I have unfinished business with the Arabs . I shall move south with Gordon 's army . We 'll go with you . Good show ! I 'll go get the horses . All right , here you are . Mount up . Sharpen the focus , Ann . I 'm trying to . It 's not the probe . You 'd better get it straightened out , Ray . I don 't like the looks of that place they 've come into . Pretty sophisticated instruments . [ Doug ] Yeah , they 're years in the future of our own time . - [ Tony ] I wonder what they 're used for . - I don 't know . But right now , I 'd settle for just knowing where we are . - He 's dead . - Well , he can 't be . There 's no doubt about it . That impact - It wasn 't hard enough to kill a man . Let 's see if we can find somebody . [ Groaning ] He isn 't as dead as you thought . I tell you , he was . Look at him . He 's a walking dead man .

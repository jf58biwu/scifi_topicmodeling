 So , your husband went to the ranch with this man , Wolfe , and never came back . He said if I didn 't hear from him , I should come to you . He said you were old friends . Enrique is a good man . We 've worked together before . What business did he have with this man , Wolfe ? He was just made commander of the Mexican military post in Mexicali . It had something to do with that , I 'm sure . Thorald Wolfe ... ex-Army major ... top-notch ordnance man ... cashiered out of the Army for taking bribes . He 's interested in Mexican forces on the border . Well , he 's gone . He 's long gone . That 's an interesting gun he had , huh ? Very . Fires explosive bullets . Can 't buy a gun like that at your friendly neighborhood pawnbroker . Whoever came up with a gun like that isn 't friendly . Oh , boy ... the cleaning woman is going to hate us for this . What happened ? Nothing to be concerned about . Oh , just a visitor . We get them dropping by all the time . Mrs. Leon , do you know what dealings your husband had with this man , Wolfe ? He once said something about betrayal ... a lot of money . Enrique would never betray his country ! Yet he went to meet Wolfe . Where ? Wolfe has a ranch near Jacumba . I 'm afraid , señor ! Even now , my Enrique could be dead . As we remember your husband , señora , he 'd take a lot of killing . Can you use a gun ? I know how . That bullet was meant for you . I 'm going to send you back to Mexicali with Artemus . You stay out of sight . If you have to ... use it . No ... I want to help my husband . I understand how you feel . If you really want to help your husband , you 'll do exactly as I tell you to . From now on , it 's man 's work . Sometimes a woman can do a man 's work better than a man . Maybe , but not this time . Señora Leon ? Explosive bullets . Take an awfully good ordnance man to design a gun like that . I 've got an idea . If Wolfe is interested in Enrique , who 's only a captain , what would he do if he had a Mexican officer of higher rank to deal with ? I 've always wanted to be a general . Be modest ; be a colonel . How do you like that ? I 'm not in the Army ten seconds and I 'm busted already . What about you ? First we hear that Wolfe 's hiring men that don 't mind using a gun . What about those men that were broken out of the Army stockade last week ? You think he 's behind that thing , too ? Those are the kind of men he 's been hiring . Washington sent us here to find out about them . I think Washington would be interested in knowing that he 's making deals with Mexican officers , too . Then you do think he 's behind those prisoner outbreaks . There 's a good chance that prison camp raid was organized by a military man . Carried out like a cavalry raid . It all ties up with Wolfe ... renegade soldier , ex-career Army man , freebooter . Mr. West ! Say , that was some shooting ! Actually , I was aiming at your ears . I don 't know how I missed . Here . They did a fine job . Dick , remind me to get a different photographer . I don 't have bags under my eyes . Only $ 500 reward ? I 'm worth more than that . Mr. West , are you sure you don 't need any help ? I 'm available . Take it easy . Your turn will come . Robert Crandell . Robbery , murder , escaped from federal territorial prison , Yuma . They posted ? Yeah , all over California , Arizona , New Mexico and Nevada . I think I posted most of them myself . I could use a new thumb . Or a smaller hammer . Hey , what about Mr. Gordon ? Artemus can take care of himself . Yeah , but if he gets caught in Mexico , masquerading as a Mexican officer , won 't he get in real trouble ? Hmm . He gets fat on trouble . You worried ? Well , we were taught in training to be very careful about international incidences . Oh , don 't worry about it , Dick . With any luck , I should be in with Wolfe by tomorrow morning . Wolfe is hiring men . He 's not too particular about their moral character . Do you know why he 's hiring them ? That 's what I intend to find out . Gee , Mr. West , I sure wish I could go along with you . My next assignment , there may be pretty girls involved . If there are , Richard , I 'll take you with me . Now you take care of yourself . And , Richard , watch that thumb . What 's the matter with you ? You want to get run over ? What do you want ? I asked you a question ! Where 's Wolfe ? Are you crazy , riding in here big as life ? Now I 'm going to ask you a question . I asked you , " Where 's Wolfe ? " What do you want Wolfe for ? Heard he was hiring . Hiring who ? What do I look like , stupid ? A ribbon clerk ? You look like a man hunting trouble . I heard there was work here - big work and big money . You don 't look like big money to me . I 'll find Wolfe myself . Why , you , I 'll knock you ... Hold it ! I 'm going to kill him . Ah , shut up ! Robert Crandell ... I don 't care who he is ! He can 't push me around . Yeah , well , I think he did pretty well . Worth $ 500 dead . He must be worth a lot more alive . Crandell ... Yeah , that 's my name . You sent for me ? Well , I don 't know . Who are you ? Do you always rub people the wrong way , Crandell ? I 'm Wolfe . Yeah , I wanted to see you . You don 't look like a foolish man . What did you want to see me about ? I heard you were hiring . And I am , but , uh ... I like to know who the people are that I 'm hiring . Were you in the Army ? Union Army . Did you like it ? Are you crazy ? Most of us here are Army men , and we like the Army way . I 've got my own way . Well , I 'm sure you have , but the question is ... can you be valuable to me ? Try me . Very well . Sergeant Bender . Shoot him ! Very good . What if I wasn 't so very good ? Sergeant Bender would have shot you . What do you think , Sergeant ? He 's good . He 's real smooth . Now , if he can use that gun ... Oh , he can use the gun , all right . I know all about Mr. Crandell 's record . He 's a bushwhacker , a backstabber , and a very fast gun for sale , aren 't you , Mr. Crandell ? A man has to make a living . And if I hire you , you 'll make a very good living ... on my terms , you understand . You 're doing the talking . Well , we run things on a military basis , Mr. Crandell . Very strict military discipline . And if anybody breaks the rules , they are dealt with most severely . All right , you 've got your own way of doing things . All I want to know is what 's in it for me . Power , Crandell . Power . Glory . Wealth . A portion of destiny . A whole new world . A great and important project . And I need men with daring . I need men who aren 't afraid of great visions . Are you that kind of a man , Mr. Crandell ? I 'm a good gun . If there 's money in it , then I 'm interested . Fair enough . We 'll give you a chance . Sergeant ... Mr. Crandell is to have the freedom of the post ... on a probationary basis , of course . Yes , sir . Just a minute . What is this big deal I 'm being cut in on ? You 'll know with the other new men within an hour . At that time , I will tell you all I wish you to know . Carry on , Sergeant . What about my gun ? Pick it up at charger quarter 's office . Look around , get acquainted . Play your cards right , and you 'll get along . Step out of line ... and you 're in big trouble . Just like the Army , huh ? Just like this Army . Those the new repeating models ? Right off the assembly line . Señor Wolfe . Permit me , eh ? Colonel Hernando del Valle Santiago y Sandoval . It 's a pleasure to meet such a practical man , Colonel . But , uh , your little proposition appealed to the romanticist in me as well as to the economist , no ? When your , uh , representative came to see me , I said to myself , " There is a man after my own heart . " Then you understand everything . Perfectly ... and I am delighted . Shall we , uh , go inside ? Of course . Hey , Crandell . Hold it . You know , it 's time for your briefing . What if I don 't like what I hear ? Then I 'm afraid you got big trouble . Come on . Sit down . Sit down , gentlemen . This is Colonel Sandoval , Inspector General of the northern border of the Army of Mexico . Colonel Sandoval has promised us complete cooperation . In what ? I 'm getting to that , Crandell . Now , when you new men joined me , you said you had plenty of guts . Well , you 're going to need every ounce . You men are going to assist me in the military conquest and occupation of Baja California . Rich . Untouched . Undeveloped . Populated by friendly Indians ... undefended . It 's all there for the taking , gentlemen , if anybody has the guts to take it . And we have that ! And what 's the Mexican Army going to do ? Just stand by while we walk in and take over ? I think I am best qualified to answer that , Señor Wolfe . Oh , thank you , Colonel . Please do . Yes , my friend , the Mexican government is indeed going to stand by and do nothing . In the interior of Mexico , the Yaqui Indians are in revolt . Revolucion has broken out in Chiapas , Sonora , Michohuacan . It will be months before the central government can move against us . By that time , we will be secure behind our fortifications . Baja will be ours ! And after that ... who knows what can be accomplished by brave and ruthless men . Thank you , Colonel . You catch on quickly . Sergeant , will you take over , please ? Thank you , sir . Gentlemen , there are 200 men standing by in Ensenada , waiting to take over the port . One word from Mr. Wolfe , and the port 's ours . That word will come very soon . Here 's where we attack . We cross the border at Mexicali , Tecate , Tijuana ... with only scattered forces to oppose us . Most of whom , thanks to me , will be on maneuvers at the crucial hour . What happens then ? You 've got the imagination of a clam . A nation of men like us ? Who take what we want when we want it ? We write our own ticket . We make our own rules . The fighting probably won 't be as hard on you as the celebrating after you 've taken it . And while all this is going on , President Grant will be playing Tiddlywinks with the American Army , right ? You 're one of the smart ones , aren 't you ? I keep trying . Well , Grant won 't do anything . Mexico doesn 't like gringos meddling in their affairs . We attack . The American Army might as well be playing Tiddlywinks as try to stop us . We take Baja California ! With the aid of , uh , Colonel Sandoval , of course . Of course . Now , you men will get your individual assignments from Sergeant Bender . Colonel , uh , would you join me outside , please ? I have a few things I 'd like to show you . It 's a big project . You think we can get away with it ? Can 't miss . Get outside . Of my own design , Colonel . Ah ... Are you a , uh , weapons expert ? I was the best ordnance man the Union Army ever had , only they didn 't know it . But they 'll know it soon . Simple , isn 't it ? Makes an artillery man out of an infantryman . I would be very much interested to see it work . Oh ? Crandell ! Yes ? Here , see how good a shot you really are . Cute . It 's far from cute . There 's a weather vane over there . See if you can hit it . In which eye ? Just hit it . Fantastico . It 's a pretty good piece . I could have used this in the old days . You 'll be using one like this very soon . That was quite a good shot . I could have hit it with a brick . Hey , if all your men can shoot as good as this one , eh ... What is your name , señor ? Crandell . Bob Crandell . Hmm . If I had an army of men such as this , if I had only 200 , I could take Baja California by myself . Yes , Colonel , but I have the men . And my cooperation , no ? Which will make it that much easier for me . Of course . Oh , one more thing , Señor Wolfe . You know , sooner or later , my government 's armies will move against you . It will take time , but they cannot just stand by . Of course not . I 'll be expecting them ... with , uh , some surprises . Oh , you better watch this , too , Crandell . You 've been asking a lot of questions . Maybe the Turtle will answer them for you . Gatling gun ... four-pound field piece ... quarter-inch armor plate . Rifle bullets will bounce right off it . Now I send a dozen of these to deploy along the Colorado River . What does your army do when it runs up against them ? They will probably run a lot , señor . Your own invention , Mr. Wolfe ? All mine . Built by the finest armorers in Europe who came to join up with me . You see , my vision attracts all kinds of men . I prefer money . Visions aren 't spendable . This is where the money is . You 're a clod , Crandell . A fast gun who can 't think past his next drink . I can see the vision , señor . First , Baja California , then Mexico , then all of Central America , huh ? All the old empire of the Conquistadores . Ah , yes ... but the Conquistadors were not armed as we will be . Yes . Think I 'm crazy , eh , Crandell ? You may get lucky . It won 't be luck . Go on about your business . A little military discipline will do you some good . Ah ! It inspires me , Señor Wolfe . A weapon like this , and a rifle like that . Why stop at Baja California ? Why not all Mexico , immediately , eh ? A child must learn to crawl before he can walk , Colonel . True . But the day will come . Marvelous ! Oh , you must give me Sinaloa , eh ? I know a hacienda there . It would make a perfect palace for the Governor . And the most beautiful women in the world come from Sinaloa . You must visit me . You will be my guest , eh ? Why , of course , Governor . You can count on it . Good , good . Hey , Bender , what do I do now ? Join that work party over there . Lend a hand loading them crates . I didn 't sign up to be a laborer . You signed up to take orders . Now do what I told you . Who 's that ? Name 's Crandell . Escaped from the Yuma Territorial a week ago . Crandell ? Doesn 't ring a bell , but he sure looks familiar . Probably ran across him someplace , maybe in the Army . No , not that long ago . Somewhere . Well , come on , we got more important things to worry about . Now , listen . You send ten men across at Achour , armed with an X-2 rifle and grenades . Right , we take the outpost , then ... That 's it . What 's it ? That guy 's wife . That 's where I 've seen that other guy before - they were in that railroad car together . Come on ! You , Crandell ! Kill that man ! He 's a spy ! Hold it ! Hold it ! What 's this all about , Sergeant ? Crandell , sir - he 's a spy . Are you sure ? Holfield saw him the other night when he tried to silence that Leon woman . No doubt about it ? Positive identification , sir . Well , that was quite a mistake , Mr. Whatever - your-name-is . Win a few , lose a few . A spy in your own headquarters ? That is very sloppy work , Señor Wolfe . Oh , that 'll be easily remedied . Why ? What are you going to do with him ? What does one do with a spy ? Shoot him , of course . Of course . Looks like your days as a filibusterer are at an end , Señor . I don 't like the hours anyhow . Lock him up ! I got caught with my plans on , that 's all . It 's ridiculous - the whole crackpot idea . No , it isn 't . He can do it . Take over Baja California ? Who 's going to stop him ? I have 20 men in my post in Mexicali , seven more at Tecate , 15 at Tijuana . That 's not the kind of forces you can rely on to stop an invasion . What about the rest of the Mexican Army ? Wolfe is right . The Army is fighting the Yaquis . Could be months before we could get a force organized to move against Baja California . Well , we 're not going to stop him from in here . How do they feed you ? They open the door , then slide it in at the bottom . They ever take you out for exercise , questioning ? Never . I 've been in here since Wolfe found out I was against him . He doesn 't need me anymore . He 's got a colonel now . We 've got a colonel . That 's Artemus . Gordon ? Wolfe believes him ? You know Art ; he 's got winning ways . You got a visitor , Leon . Don 't try anything stupid , Crandell . Ah , Captain Leon . What do you want , traitor ? The caged rat would do well not to snarl at the tiger , eh ? I want your signature , Captain Leon , for the sake of the record . You will never get it . I don 't need it , of course . My own signature would suffice . But I think it would look better for the record if the order sending the border posts out on maneuvers came from their regular commander . You will carry out your treachery without my help . I simply want in all ways to keep the confidence of my troops . Forget it , Colonel . Most uncooperative . What do you intend to do with young captain ? He 'll be shot . They both will . When ? Tomorrow morning . Sad . Such young men . But it 's always the young ones who are the most foolish , no ? I couldn 't say . A little explosive Artemus developed . But just getting out won 't solve anything . It 'll be a start . But what then ? Can you operate a Gatling gun ? Of course . Then maybe we can give them a run for their money . But you need a fuse for that . Now all we need is the proper moment . Tomorrow , then ? Precisely at dawn , if that gives you time enough . I certainly hope so , eh ? Then Ensenada will be ours by 8 : 00 . The border posts , if you do what you say you can , by 10 : 00 . I promise you action , my friend . Lots of it , eh ? Adios . You trust him ? I don 't trust any man I can buy that easily , but I 'm sure he 'll give the right orders . What then , after we take over ? I think we 'll be able to dispense with his services ... permanently . A little libation , Sergeant , in honor the occasion ? Glad to , Mr. Wolfe . I 've , uh ... I 've been wondering , Mr. Wolfe ... Wondering what ? The reason . The real reason you 're doing this . A wolf is born to hunt . You put a wolf in a cage ... he can 't hunt . He dies . I 'm a soldier , Sergeant , just like you . And , of course , it 's a good way of getting back at the government for what they did to you . Oh , no , no , no , you 're wrong . I don 't hold that against them . I was clumsy . I took a bribe and I got caught . I would have court-martialed myself if I had been them . Oh , but they were fools - kicking you out of the Army - a man with your talents . A man of my talents cannot be held by protocol and regulations . I have to make my own rules , Sergeant , and I will . I 'll have my own nation run according to my own rules . You know what that means ? I have some idea . You 're thinking of the thousands of good men throughout the world who are on the run . An army of them ... looking for a place to hide . Well , I 'll give it to them ... as long as they follow my rules . Criminals ... revolutionaries , desperate men . Oh , what an army they 'll make . Of course , there 'll be a discipline problem . The French Foreign Legion doesn 't have any trouble . They whip the toughest of men into line , and I can do the same . My legions ... 10,000 ... 100,000 , 500,000 desperate men . First we take Baja California . Then we have all of Latin America at our feet . Makes a soldier 's mouth water , doesn 't it , Sergeant ? Oh , I 'll drink to that . How 'd you ever get mixed up in this ? I 'm not proud of it . Why ? Well , in my army ... these , uh , border posts are the end of the world . When you are assigned to one of them , ha , you know you just stay there and decay . Mexico City forgets all about you . And you 're an ambitious man , right ? Anything wrong with ambition ? No ... not unless that ambition gets you into trouble . And it got me into trouble , all right . Wolfe contacted me . He didn 't come right out and tell me what he had in mind . Hinted around . He said he was looking for a man who would cooperate ... if the price was right . Was the price right ? Governorship of Baja California . And I was bitter . Sure , I 'd spend the rest of my career a forgotten captain commanding a forgotten post . I decided to talk to him . That doesn 't explain how you ended up in jail . I should have seen it coming . Wolfe told me everything , and I just ... couldn 't do it . I had my moment of weakness , but it went away . I , uh ... turned him down . Why didn 't you go along with him ? I couldn 't . My country may have forgotten me , but I haven 't forgotten my country . I would 've been surprised if you had . Well , that 's that . How do you set it off ? We don 't have a match between us . A little help from the sun , we should start off with a bang . Got a piece of paper ? Nothing . They took everything . There 's nothing in the cell that will burn , either . Mad money . That looks like a ... a $ 100 bill ? Can you change it ? Well , I always did want money to burn . When do we do it ? Whenever it 's right . Whenever they 're busy doing something else . You seem uneasy , Sergeant . Oh , I always get a few butterflies the day before we jump off . Oh . Well , I have a little job for you . Maybe it 'll calm your nerves . Certainly , Mr. Wolfe . The prisoners - Captain Leon and Crandell - can 't very well leave them behind when we jump off , now , can we ? No , sir . I want you to form a firing squad . Take them out and shoot them . Now , sir ? Right now ! Yes , sir . Higgin , Foster , you two men get your rifles and follow me . If ever I saw a firing squad ... What 's up , Sarge ? Just a little light extermination before dinner . Snap to . We 're going to be having visitors . We 've come to have a party . Everybody gather ' round . Oh , we 've got good wine , fine brandy ... Well , are there no red-blooded men here ? Doesn 't anybody want a drink ? There we are ! That 's my wife ! Keep quiet . But she could get hurt . That 's my friend with her . He won 't let anything happen to her . We wanted a break - this is it . Hey , Sarge , we can 't shoot those prisoners on a parched gullet . How about letting us get some of that ? Uh-uh , Mr. Wolfe said that we have ... Sure , sure , but he didn 't know about the dames and the liquor . Just stand by a minute . Stand by ? They 're going to drink it all up . Come on . Sergeant , what is all this ? They just showed up , sir . Shall I throw them out ? No , no , let them stay . Our men go into action tomorrow . Letting them have some fun right now might not be bad psychology . Besides , uh ... I might join them myself a little later . Yes , but what about the prisoners , sir ? They 'll keep , Sergeant . Enjoy yourself . Yes , sir . The finest vintages in all California . And when these are gone , there 's more from my cantina just across the valley , gentleman . These are just a sample . There you are . Everybody dance ! Dance and drink and laugh ! Ah , who knows what may happen tomorrow ? Brandy ! I have the finest brandy here . Who wants it , eh ? I 'll take it . Ah ! Get back against that wall . When it blows , move fast . Get going ! Get him ! Get those men ! Hurry ! Get them out of the Turtle ! Get that Gatling gun going . Aim for the gun ports ! Sergeant , get the X-2 . For every hole I have to put into the Turtle , I 'll put a dozen into their mangy hides . We 've been hit . It 's no good . He stopped us . This thing 'll protect us from regular bullets , but not from those . Keep firing . I got to get Wolfe . I can 't get a shot at him . One of these hit all that dynamite , the whole place would blow up . Look out ! Wait a minute ! Whoa ! Captain Leon , you can come out now . It looks like we 've won ourselves a war . Now you can lead your army , Mr. Wolfe , to the Federal prison . To the lovely lady that showed up at the right time with all the right equipment . Well , thank you very much . Not you . The other lovely lady . Oh . Although I must admit , you were convincing . I 'll take that as a compliment to my many talents . Otherwise , I 'd have to belt you in the mouth . Corida , you should not have done it . You could have been hurt . I had to do something . I was worried about you . Even after we said we were going after him ? I 'm disappointed in you . Is that all the faith you have in us ? But I told her absolutely she should stay out of it . A woman 's place is to obey her husband . And aren 't you glad I didn 't ? Well , if you 're going to be practical about it ... Of course , much of the credit goes to the grand old lady of the Secret Service - Artemus Gordon . You 're never going to let me live that down , are you ? No , I have no intention of it . Okay , go ahead , laugh , laugh , but who was it that went out with three beautiful women ? Me . And didn 't we have a good time ... Say , I just thought of something . I wonder what those two other girls are doing tonight . Now you 're thinking , Artemus . I know exactly what they 're doing tonight . What ? They 're staying home with their husbands . Any more suggestions , Artemus ? Yes . Soup 's getting cold .

 " Lo ! Death has reared himself a throne " in a strange city lying alone " far down within the dim west " where the good and the bad and the worst and the best " have gone to their eternal rest " resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lie " but lo , a stir is in the air " the wave- - There is a movement there " as if their tops had given death " his undivided time " there 's a body , Mr. Harris , and strangely dressed . I can see that . Who is it ? 'Tis Mr. penrose , the lawyer who 's been advising miss tregellis . Poor devil . It 's the devil 's work , right enough . Be quiet , you old fool . I told you nothing good would come of this- - An American girl at the manor house , solicitors , and this young man with his rock samples and questions about the old mine workings . You old bag of wind , he 'll hear you . He has . Now , what about the body ? Somebody 's got to tell miss tregellis . All right , I 'll go . Mr. Harris ? Couldn 't be you 've come to help us about the electricity ? The lights be gone out with the storm . Not like the old days , a candle could be depended upon . I 've come to see miss tregellis . You should be here about the lights . The guests are grumbling proper . Come . Come in . I 'll take you to her . You wait here . I 'll fetch miss tregellis . I 'll come along with you . Miss tregellis is with one of the guests . An artist , he says he is . Something strange about him . Most that he paints don 't look like much . He 's brought the beast with him . The beast ? You 'll see . It 's in there with them . Who is it ? It 's mumford , mum . Mr. Harris is here . He insists on seeing you . Just a minute . I 'm not staying . The last time I waited , the beast got out . I 'm opening the door , but come in quickly . How nice to see you . Her name is Herbert . Her name is Herbert ? Uh , Jill , I came to talk to you about Mr. penrose . Oh , Ben , I 'm so disappointed . I thought maybe this was a social call . I mean , we 're the only 2 Americans in the whole village . Don 't you think we should be friends ? Harold ? Yes ? Mr. Harris captured Herbert for us . Yes , he 's one of our guests . He 's an artist . Would you like to meet him ? Oh , yes , I would . Yes , very much . Well , come on in then and close the door . This is Mr. Ben Harris . How do you do ? Oh , how do you do ? And this is Mr. Harold tufnell-Jones . You 're , uh , wondering what I 'm doing up here , aren 't you ? I 'm not up here all the time . It 's just Herbert 's been giving us a bit of a chase . Would you mind helping me down ? Would you mind if I talked with miss tregellis about her lawyer ? Well , I 'm sure that can wait till I 'm down on terra firma . Would you give me a hand ? Well , of course . About Mr. penrose- - I 'll take you in to see him in a minute . He 's been in his study all day . How do you do ? Thank you very much . It 's quite all right . Please , will you come with me ? There 's something I 'd like to show you . Self-portrait . Do you like it ? It 's , uh , it 's a good likeness , if anybody would want such a thing . I-I 'm sure someone will , Ben . " If anyone would want such a thing ? " I signed it myself . Look . Harold tufnell-Jones , f.R.A. A fellow of the royal academy ? Not actually . Founder of the roosters ' association . Very select . Ah . You say that Mr. Penrose is in his study ? Yes , just across the hall . Jill , I 've just come up from the beach and- - Somebody 's in there . What is it ? Go back to the other room and wait for me . Go on . Go on , please . Ben , are you all right ? Did anyone go out that door ? No . Are you sure ? I 'm positive . Should anyone have ? I don 't know . Where 's Mr. penrose ? I found his body on the beach . He 's dead . We shouldn 't leave the body there . Ah , what are you afraid of ? I don 't know one man who can call me coward and look me in the face . There are things no man should have to see or hear . What things ? Ah , he 's been hearing them ghost bells again . Yes , I heard them last night and they were red in the sea , like blood color . Well , I never heard ' em and I was born here . Come on , son . Do you really hear those ghost bells ? Yes , I heard ' em . Deep down in the sea , they were . Bells from a shipwreck , is it ? It 's lyonesse , the lost city in the sea ! I always thought that was an old wives ' tale . Ah , there 's a city there , right enough . Thousands of years back , the sea just came and swallowed it up . And there it lies now , buried in the deep . Why does the bell sound ? Well , we found Mr. Penrose , didn 't we ? There have been other bodies , too . When the bell sounds , it means death . There we are . That 's better . Now , there 's , uh , there 's just this one . Hey , where 're the nails ? There 's a book missing from the set here . Oh , I shouldn 't worry about that . Things are always disappearing in tregathion . Oh , really ? Yeah . Do you know the old rector vanished about 50 years ago ? Never been seen since . You know something , Harold , you are a mine of fascinating information . Now , it 's funny you say that , because it is said that he was lost in an old tin mine . Funny you mentioned mines . But , uh , what 's that got to do with the missing book ? Oh , the book 's unimportant . You see , I did a sketch of Jill and put it between the pages . Oh , really ? Where are those nails ? Well , why would anyone want to steal your sketch of Jill ? Well , Ben , modesty prevents me from saying that perhaps it was a man of great taste , who , who fancied a work of art . Oh , here they are . I wonder ... Hold that , will you ? You know , all these things happening- - penrose 's death and that sketch in the book disappearing . What about them ? Well , they 're all connected . I mean , they have one thing in common--Jill . You 're a great one for mysteries , aren 't you ? You 're just trying to frighten us . Isn 't he , Herbert ? What do you think happened in here ? I told you , I saw this thing . I-I don 't know what it was . It-it wasn 't human . Now , Ben , you 're sensible , you 're intelligent , you 're a man of the world , savoir-faire . Now let 's admit that--that anyone in the semidarkness could mistake a--an intruder for something more mysterious . Now , it 's possible , isn 't it ? Now , listen , I 'm a mining engineer , a trained observer . I look for the little things that the ordinary eye might pass over , because the slightest clue could mean a fortune to those who employ me . Now , if I say I saw something or someone that could be superhuman , I mean it . I 'm going to put on a proper pair of trousers--with legs on . Herbert ! Herbert ! Thank you for your kindness , Ben . What are you going to do now , stay here in england or go back to America ? I don 't know . The estate isn 't settled yet . Well , Mr. penrose was working on it when ... Try not to think about it . I just can 't help it . Jill , listen to me . Now , I tell you , you are in danger . Now , all I want you to do is move someplace where there are more people . Well , I 'm not running away . Oh , you 're stubborn . Now what are you doing ? I 'm just checking . You 'd better leave them that way , do you hear ? Seaweed . There you go again . All right , all right , I 'm imagining things . That 's what everybody says , so I better believe it . Maybe you should . I found Herbert . I 'm going up to bed now . Goodnight , Jill . Goodnight , Ben , and you get some rest , now . Goodnight . Goodnight . Charming girl , absolutely charming . An inspiration to any artist , I 'd say . I wonder if anyone would mind if I put my feet up on the sofa for the night . Charming . Whatever for ? To keep an eye on things . Very wise . You 'll pardon me if I turn in . I want to get plenty of sleep . I 'm painting an entirely new canvas first thing in the morning- - The sunset . A sunset in the morning ? I 'm a slow worker . Goodnight , old fella . Goodnight . Oh , it 's you . I do wish you 'd stop playing the giddy goat . You could 've hurt me . I might never have painted again . I suppose you 've some reason for skulking around behind doors . I just caught up with Herbert . He 'd escaped again . I had a feeling this sort of thing would happen . Now , whatever it was that was in here before came back and took Jill . But how ? These old houses are full of sliding passages and secret thingamajigs . Leave this to me ! You know what 's wanted here ? Brainpower . Now , if there 's a hidden door , there must be a--a concealed button somewhere . My instinct tells me to press , uh , here . Or there . Ben . You going in there after her ? You are . Heh , you 're not expecting me to go in there , too , are you ? Come on . I warn you , Ben , I 'm a little bit of a coward . This is the way she was taken . It smells like an overripe cheese . There 's a trail of seawater . Heh , heh . And quite a lot of seaweed . A marvelous place for a Chinese restaurant . Let 's try this way . Come on . Wait here . Ben ? Ben ? Look out ! There 's a lot to be said for ducks . Water rolls off their backs . They can swim and help a person , not like some chickens I know . What on earth is this place ? I don 't know . It , uh , looks like- - Like some sort of a Watergate . Oh , why don 't you leave that chicken behind ? She 'll only get in the way . Ah , he doesn 't know who 's man 's best friend , does he , Herbert ? It must lead somewhere . And I 've got a nasty feeling you want to find out where . Don 't worry , Herbert , everything 's fine . Look , Ben , if there 's going to be an earthquake , let 's get off the bridge . I 'm not coming here for my summer holidays . Let 's find out what 's up ahead . Ben , let 's just sit here and--and wait for something pleasant to happen . Watch out ! You almost lost your bird . Thank you and Herbert thanks you . Don 't you , Herbert ? Might even lay you an egg . Where is it coming from ? What is it ? Well , what about this ? What ? Down there ? It 's the only way . Be careful . What on earth have we got ourselves into ? Let 's see if we can help him . Let 's get that chain off him . Get out ! Quickly ! That way ! In a few seconds this place will be full of water . Go on ! It 's no use , Ben , we can 't help him . Go on ! What kind of people would do things like this ? Let 's find Jill . Jill . Seismology by j.S. Tilton . Why , that 's odd . This hasn 't been through the sea . None of it has . And how do they get the oil for the lamps ? Here 's my sketch of Jill . How did this get here ? Very odd . Where is she ? Where is she ? You fight very well , young man . Did you kill him ? It doesn 't really matter . He dislikes me . He 'd like to step into my shoes , not that he ever will . Get up . Oh , don 't worry , he won 't touch you , Dan . He might even teach you how to fight , if you asked him very humbly . Get up ! Well , now we 've got that little matter settled , uh , who do we have the--the , uh ... May I , uh ... Who are you , sir ? He be the captain . It seems you tried to come down the passages at the wrong time . As it happens , we have a ... Local phenomenon here that creates something of a maelstrom under certain conditions of tide and circumstance . I see . Well , perhaps you 'll be kind and show us the way out ? There is no way out , not for you . And not for him . Nor for the girl ? Is she alive ? You will answer the questions , not ask them . No way out ? Well , y-you 're not planning to keep us here for good ! You 're right , we 're not . Then why can 't we go ? Because there is an outside chance that you might be of help . I-I 'd like to help . I 'm delighted to be of assistance at a-any time . I 'm only too pleased . And if we can 't help you ? Survival down here depends on usefulness . In that case , how could we help you ? Follow me . Beautiful , isn 't it ? What- - What is it ? The city in the sea . Lyonesse ? Perhaps . One name is as good as another . I asked , in what way could we help you ? There it is- - The volcano . The peak is petrified sand , which is why it 's transparent . But the pressure of molten lava sealed inside of it has been building up steadily , steadily . It was the pull of that monster , the elemental power that is in it , that brought you to our doorstep . I remember when it was practically dormant . But over the years that glow has increased . The shocks , too- - Always stronger . Yes , the end is coming . Another year , another month , another week . Another week ? Yes , perhaps . Perhaps even sooner . Yes , you are looking at the final executioner . Time is running out . The only question now is--when ? Do you hear those pumps ? They were installed by the people who built it- - A great people . So great that when the sea took their land , they built those pumps to pipe the heat from the volcano and to provide fresh air and water . And they lived down there , those people , for a while , under the sea in their palaces and towers . And then they died , almost completely ... Except for them . The Gill-men , the half-men , pathetic remnants of a great nation . But they 're my people , all the same . Your people ? Yes . Yes , this is my world . I am their king . No , more than their king . They believe that I am death- - Death looking gigantically down from my tower . And they 're right , I am death , because the means of death is in my hands . But I am also life for the same reason . Except for the volcano ? Yes . Except for the volcano . Unless those tremors cease , the pumps will stop . They must ! And when the pumps stop , my city will die . And so will my people . I 've done my best . I 've racked my brains to think of a way to fight back . Raids up above there , seeking a solution . We took this many years ago . It 's a seismometer . You know , it registers the tremors of the earth . But what has it shown ? Only the increasing violence of the volcano growing stronger day by day . And then we 've looked for books . Ah , yes , like this one . I read it last night from cover to cover . But it 's less than useless . But I must save my people . How can you ? We 've heard of the strides that science made in this century . But what do you mean , " science in this century " ? Look , how long have you been here ? I will ask the questions . And I cannot accept defeat . No man has a right to . Look . Those are my people . It 's a hunting party , which my men are directing . These creatures , they help us to obtain food . Needless to say , our stipend down here is fish . You know how many years it has been since I have eaten beef or ... Chicken ? Chicken ? What about penrose ? We found his body . Ah , I gave him a chance . I don 't know why , perhaps because I liked him . But he was of no use , so I sent him out with one of those diving suits . I gave him a head start . Yes , he even got as far as the- - The golden shrine , but no further . Because your men killed him . I said he had his chance . So do you have a chance . You say this is the end . Why do you stay ? There 's a way out of here and you know where it is , so why don 't you get out now while you can ? No . Why not ? You 'll learn the answer to that question if you live long enough . I see . Well , to get back to the question of finding your way out- - Who are you ? Uh , my name is Harold tufnell-Jones . I 'm an artist . This is Herbert . Chicken ! You don 't know how lucky you are . This is Benjamin Harris . Professor Benjamin--Benjamin Harris . Professor . Yes , he 's a fellow of the royal society . He-he holds both the north of england and the south of england golden awards for technological achievement . He 's an ma , ba , fscg , He 's got more letters after his name , you 'd think he was the alphabet . And what he doesn 't know about earthquakes and seimonoso- - seismo- - seismology and technological achievements , is absolutely not worth knowing . Is this true ? Of course it 's true ! This fella , j.S. Tilton , he 's an amateur . My friend Ben , he 's the--the expert . The expert , aren 't you ? Heh , heh . Can you save my city ? Uh , from the volcano ? Yes . Can you stop it , tame it , kill it ? Well , th-this is a matter for consideration , and consideration takes time . There is no time . No time . Captain ... This is our tide meter . The tide will turn when the water level drops to zero . You have exactly 3 hours , professor . Make the most of your time . No , leave it ! I-I did that , uh , drawing . I-it 's not perhaps one of my best , would you say ? A little too realistic , perhaps . You 're an indifferent artist , sir . The young lady is much more beautiful than this . Then she is alive and she 's here ? Yes , and you are alive , too . Try to remain so . Where is she ? Simon . Take these men to the grotto chamber . It will do you no good to question Simon . His tongue was cut out 60 years ago . 60 years ? Take them . Who 's that whispering ? Oh , I 'm so sorry . Are you as crazy as the captain ? What do I know about volcanoes ? That 's interesting . Could be babylonian . Well , Herbert , we 've had a busy day , haven 't we ? Not that we 've accomplished much . Harold , what do I know about volcanoes ? About as much as the captain , which is nothing at all . I 'm beginning to think you talk too much . If I stop talking , we 're dead . Do you want me to stop ? All right , I 'm sorry . But 60 years ! A tongue cut out 60 years ago , yet I-I 'd swear the man 's in his early 30s . Which suggests that the captain is lying . I don 't know . But where did they get those diving suits and those- - Those silly crossbows ? Heh , pretty ancient , aren 't they ? Might have been used by rip Van winkle . Well , quite obviously , they haven 't been sleeping . The poems of Edgar Allen poe . This is the English first edition , published in 1847 . It must be worth a fortune . " No rays from the holy heaven come down " on the long nighttime of that town " for light from out the lurid sea " streams up the turrets silently " gleams up the pinnacles far and free " up domes , up spires , up kingly halls " up fanes- - Up Babylon-like walls " up shadowy long-forgotten bowers " up sculptured Ivy and stone flowers " up many and many a marvelous shrine " whose wreathed friezes intertwine " the viol , the Violet , and the vine " so blend the turrets and shadows there " that all seem pendulous in air " while from a proud tower in the town " death looks gigantically down " the waves have now a redder glow " the hours are breathing faint and low " and when , amid no earthly moans " down , down that town shall settle hence " hell , rising from 1000 thrones " shall do it reverence " " the end . " The volcano- - Hell itself . The , ah , the poem 's a coincidence . And a gruesome one . We 've got to get out of here . There must be a way . It could be one of those passages . Yes , very possibly . It 'd be a pity to leave here without some sort of memento . Nothing valuable . Just a little something . All we 'll take is Jill . But we 've got to find her . Aye , and you can . No problem about that . You ... You mean we 're free ? As birds in a cage , for you shall never find your way up there unless I help you . Well , how ? Walls have ears . If he should hear us ... Well , how can he hear us ? You 're dealing with a crazy one . He 'll kill us all . All right ! All right ! Can you take us to miss tregellis ? The girl ? Yes . And I can take you away from here . But I 'm coming with you and I want a free pardon . A free pardon . You 're a gentleman- - Important . You can use your influence up there to get me a free pardon . For what ? What would it be but smuggling ? Well , there are other crimes- - Murder , robbery- - Smuggling , it were . He were the captain , a big man , squire of tregathion . He owned the manor house and all the land around for miles . He were a gentleman , but a smuggler just the same . We all worked for him . Did pretty well , too , till those excise men moved in . Excise men ? Aye . Couldn 't keep their big noses out of it . They moved in one night . We all escaped . Upwards of 20 of us , with the captain . Down the passages we went . We knew them all . Down into the sea we come . And we found the city and we 've been here ever since . Ever since when ? Oh , that was , uh ... Summer of 1803 . You must be mad . Who wouldn 't be after 100 years of this ? 100 years ? You don 't believe me , eh ? See for yourselves . This book belonged to his wife- - The captain 's wife . Have a look . That be the captain 's name- - Hugh . Hugh . Sir Hugh , if you want the facts . Sir Hugh . He were a knight of the realm . And that be the captain 's handwriting . Writ with a quill pen . See how the ink 's all faded with age . Well , how can you prove that it 's the captain 's writing ? I 'll tell you how , sir . You see , it 's the same letter " o , " the same " e " and the same " t . " And that 's no more than 8 years old . And there 's the pen he used that time . A fountain pen . Aye , brought down here by some gent who said the likes of that had only just been invented . Well , the captain writ those words with it . And he wrote those back in 1799 . Well , sir ? Is it a bargain ? I can take you to the woman and I can take you to tregathion . But do I get my pardon up there ? There 'll be no pardon for you , not anywhere . I knew you 'd do this , Dan . No , captain . I was only telling them about us . About us ? Did they believe you ? 100 years old ? Rather more , as it happens . It is hard to accept , is it not ? You need our help . Well , I 'd say the world needs yours . You found a way to live forever . It is a secret that we cannot pass on , sir . Now , unfortunately , it is only a local phenomenon . I still can 't believe it . You wouldn 't . We didn 't believe it ourselves , not for the first 10 or 20 years . Then we began to find out that none of us was growing any older . So we finally decided that it was the quality of the air , due to an imbalance of oxygen , brought on by the presence of the volcano . Did you tell them where to find her , Dan ? No , captain , I never did . No , he didn 't . He certainly didn 't . But it won 't be necessary , I 'll take you to her myself after you 've said goodbye to Dan . Goodbye ? But I never said where she was , captain . I never told them ! Look at him . Pathetic , isn 't he ? Did you really think that you could go up above there , Dan , and live ? You 're a fool . Or perhaps I should have told you the truth long ago . The truth ? It has to do with actinic rays , ultraviolet rays . Down here under the sea , they--they become diffused and they can 't harm us , but- - But up above , up there , they would finish us . But it ain 't true ! I 've been up there time and again myself and many others . Only for short periods , and only at night , Dan . In the daylight , we would grow old , Dan , so fast that it would be like a- - like a worm shriveling on a hot stone in the sun . That 's why we 're all prisoners of our own hell , Dan . But we 're alive . Yes , we are . And you might have been , if the professor can help us . Yes , that 's right . Dan . You might have lived forever and ever . But perhaps you 're lucky . Take him away ! No , captain ! No ! It was the biggest . Your pumps are still working . Yes . But for how long ? It 's coming sooner than I thought . Look . Those poor creatures , they 're frightened . And I said I would take you to the young lady and I will . Blindfold them . Now look , aren 't you carrying this thing a little too far ? Oh well , if you insist . My men will guide you . Nothing will happen to you ... Yet . I don 't like the word " yet . " Take off his blindfold . Jill . Remove his blindfold , too . Mine ? Remove it . Thank you . We put her to sleep . We gave her a sleeping draft . There 's the bell . Yes , but not the bells that you 're thinking of . They only sound at the turn of the tide . No . These are the signal for execution . Ours ? No , Dan 's . You killed him . No . I simply sent him where he wanted to go- - Up there , in the daylight . Dear me , who 've we here , huh ? Strangers , eh ? Noisy night for your first visit . Tell me , who was the- - who was the execution gong for ? Was it for--mm , no . No , no , of course not . That was 8 years ago . At least , I think it was 8 . Oh , she 's- - She 's still asleep . She 's pretty . Very pretty . A nice girl by the look of her . Well , then ... Let me introduce myself . My name is ives . Ives ? Rev. Jonathan ives . I was rector of tregathion . The village , you know . A nice place , nice people . But they say you disappeared 50 years ago . Was it as long as that ? How time flies , even down here . All right , old man , you 've talked enough . These 2 have seen enough . Blindfolds . If you harm that girl- - Harm her ? Why would I harm her ? Worry about yourselves . You 're to find a solution , remember ? Take them ! She 's waking . Watch over her , old man . Take off their blindfolds . Come with me . Ben . Dan and the captain came in this way , which means that those stairs must lead to the tower . Which way does that door lead to ? What are you up to now , Harold ? We want to escape , don 't we ? Dan said he 'd take us out of here . Yes , but he also said we needed his help to do it . Of course he 'd say that . So ? So , there must be a way out of here . Let 's find it . Well , not without Jill . No , no , of course not . She 's coming , too . How can she ? I don 't have the slightest idea where she is . I have . I counted the number of steps we took and the way we turned . When we came in this way , we took 7 steps and turned to the--to the right . So that when we go back we--we take 7 steps and we turn to the--to the left . And then , if we take 60 paces , there are the stairs . Well , what are we waiting for ? Hee Hee ! 1 , 2- - No , that can 't be right . Now , wait a minute , I-I 'll get it . 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 . Ah , did I say right or left ? Left . Right . Uh , follow me then . Beatrice . Never leave me again . You 've come back to your husband after all these years . Never leave me again . Not while I live . 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 . There . Jill , we 're going to get you out of here . We 're going to try . How did you get here at all ? We 'll tell you later . But first , do you remember the way they brought you down here ? It was dark and I was struggling so much . But there were- - There were passages . And there was a cave , I think . And then , I must have fainted . It was the last thing I remembered . There was a man , an-and the way he stared at me ... Then you didn 't come down through the sea ? Jill ? No ! Then there is a dry land route . Would you know the way ? The way out , you mean ? Oh yes , there is a way . Except my--my memory isn 't quite what it used to be . Things seem to ... Seem to elude me . Please try to remember . I 'll remember . Presently , I 'll remember . I 've noticed things seem to come and go . Oh , and , did you- - Know they killed Dan ? His mind wanders . Sometimes he knows what he 's saying , but most of the time- - What 's behind the altar ? It 's another room . He told me , it 's a dead end . Then we 'll take the other passage . I 'll go first . But wha-what about Mr. ives ? Mr. ives , would you like to come , too ? Perhaps you 'll remember if you come as well . No , thank you , sir , no . It 's such a noisy night . I prefer to take my ease . Poor Dan . He was so good . There 's some good in everybody , don 't you think ? Anyway , that 's always been the precept on which I 've built my life , my very long life . This one , the right one . It 's quite a maze , isn 't it ? I should have warned you that those passages were a waste of time . So you found the young lady , hmm ? One of you is brighter than I thought . That 's me . Then , in that case , you 're entitled to your reward . It 's a pity , however , that the professor must suffer , too . Suffer ? Simon . That 's your execution bell ? Yes , sir . But it has other uses as well . What are you going to do about us ? They will make that decision . Death ? Of course . But we 're expected to follow an established ritual . Don 't ask me how old it is . They 've been asking for a sacrifice for the volcano . Now they can have it ! What , him ? You . But that 's idiocy . Killing us won 't stop the volcano . I know that , but they don 't . If a sacrifice will make them a little happier for what little time is left ... Listen to your pumps . The sound 's different . Yes . Yes , I 'm afraid you 're right . But that doesn 't alter your situation . They have decided . You will be sent out just before the turn of the tide . Why wait for the tide ? We 're not murderers , sir . You will be given your chance . You will be given diving suits and a head start , just as penrose was . A lot of good it did him ! Yes , I agree . And I doubt if it will help you very much , either . But what chance did you give Dan ? Dan was a traitor . Your only crime was curiosity . How will a head start help us ? Will she be sent out with us , too ? No . Take her back . Oh , and , uh , by the way , do not attempt to get to her again . From now on those passages will be guarded . All right , Simon ! Simon 's still out there , of course ? What the- - Shh , be quiet . Everything above a whisper can be heard . What , in here ? Yes , here . He told me . He 's all right now . He knows what he 's saying . I do . You must 've heard them whispering . You think they can 't hear you ? How ? They have some sort of listening tubes , so whisper . But how did you get here ? There 's a guard out there . There was a guard . You , uh , you remember the way ? The way they brought Jill down here ? Yes , of course I do . But it 's no use now . That route is only clear of seawater for a few minutes every day . You have to wait 18 hours . 18 hours ? Your only chance of escape is at the turn of the tide . But they 're sending us out any minute . So the young lady told me . Out there ? You 'll have to . Because you won 't stand a chance once the guards are on your trail . You mean , you want us to go now ? You must reach the golden shrine at the turn of the tide . It 's nearly half a mile away . The cave under the cliff , just to the right of the volcano . Yes , but how do we get there ? There are some diving suits in the Watergate chamber . That must be the way you came in . Oh , he 's right , we did . It 's dangerous , I know . But if you stay , you 'll die anyway . So what can you lose ? Right . So ... You 'll go down to the Watergate chamber , the 3 of you . You 'll put on the diving suits . They 're clumsy and difficult to handle . But you 'll soon get used to them . And the locked-gate control winch is on the right . It 's rusting , but it works . Once you 're under sea , the glare from the volcano will guide you . Now if you follow the glare till you 're past the crater , then the shrine is above water level at the turn of the tide , and there 's a pathway that leads up to tregathion . But if the volcano isn 't active now , then- - Then how can it guide us ? Well , that 's just something you 'll have to accept . But what about the guards , on the way down to the Watergate ? There 'll be no guards once the alarm sounds . Alarm ? The execution gong , it 's also the alarm signal . Once the alarm sounds , any guards that are on the stairway will come rushing down the passage to make sure that you 're here . But you 'll fool them by going up to the tower and then going down the stairway from there . And nobody will hear you , not above the sound of the gong . Who 'll be in the tower room ? Only me , sounding the alarm . The captain will have gone to his room . All right , now I 'm going up to the tower . Now remember , once you hear the gong , join me immediately . Can 't you come with us ? Thank you , no . I 'm--I 'm too old and too ... Too tired . There is one point . There 's no need for you to take a chance . Because I happen to know why you were brought here . It was because of a sketch found in a stolen book . I was with the captain when he came upon it . I 've never seen a man so ... So moved , he ... He ordered them to bring you here . He was like a man possessed . But you can stay . Nobody is going to hurt you . Good luck to you . Give me 2 minutes . Oh , boy . I 'm really sorry . Don 't worry , Herbert . I 'll get you home in time for tea . Come on . Quick , on your way ! Who is that ? Now , come along . Hurry , please ! That 's a picture of me ! No , no , no . That portrait 's over 100 years old . Now , go ! It 's me . Jill ! Go , I said ! The tide won 't wait for you . He 's right , we 've got to get out ! Come on . Well , it 's try or die . Are those men there ? They 're gone , captain . They musn 't escape . They must not escape . If we get into the sea , which way do we turn ? There 's no light from the volcano . Put on your helmets . It 'll show through . Keep your eyes on me and stay close . Where is she ? Where is she ? Where are those men ? Woman . Pleasant enough ... Where is she ? Where is she ? You told them how to escape ! It was only fair . It was only fair . You men , you men , go ahead of me ! Find them ! Follow them ! You men ... Quickly , arm yourselves with those crossbows ! Come on ! Hurry up ! There 's no time to lose ! I 'll be back . Herbert , come here . Herbert , don 't be ... Harold ! Herbert . Herbert ! Jill ! He 's out there . He 's all right . Yes , but we 're in here , and we 're all wrong . Don 't just stand there . Dig . Come back . Come back ! Don 't leave me ! This place will be underwater in minutes . You--you can 't get out of here by yourselves . I can help you . Careful . Beatrice ? Beatrice , listen to me ! Tell them--tell them that we 've found each other . Beatrice , make them help me so that I can save you . The passageway , to the left . Come on , we can 't help him . It 's even too late for us . It 's locked ! All right , let 's try this . Jill ! " Death to some more happy clime " shall give his undivided time "

 [ MACHINE HISSES ] No . No . - It 's the last time , Dr. Markham . - Go back . We 've about extracted all the information we need from you . Go back to your own world . [ GRUNTING ] [ SCREAMS ] - No more . No more , please . No more . - Doc . Stop , doc . No more . It hurts . Shh ! Shh ! Shh ! They 're coming closer . Don 't let them find me . Please don 't let them find me . - They won 't find you . - They 're coming closer now . Just relax , it won 't hurt a bit . Now , just take it easy and lie down with me here now . Easy does it , doctor . Attafella . Just a little bit more . Oh , please . Oh , please . No more . No more . NARRATOR 1 : The Invaders . A Quinn Martin Production . Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . NARRATOR 2 : The invaders . Alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination : the Earth . Their purpose : to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road , looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner , and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . NARRATOR 1 : The guest stars in tonight 's story : Mark Richman , Diana van der Vlis , and special guest star , Arthur Hill . Tonight 's episode , " The Leeches " NARRATOR 2 : Two men with their eyes on the heavens , coming together now in a small southwestern city . David Vincent , who seeks the invader , and Warren Doneghan , president of JAE , Jet Age Electronics . That must be him , Tom . Two men with their eyes on the heavens . One dedicating his life to an unknown frontier , the other , to an undeclared war for survival . David Vincent ? I 'm Tom Wiley , Jet Age Electronics . This way , please . I 'm Warren Doneghan . - How do you do ? - Thank you for coming . Would you mind getting into the front seat ? I 'll take your bag . That man sitting next to you is head of security at my plant . He 's also my best friend . And he 's a stubborn , unimaginative man who can 't- - No , won 't believe , that beings from another planet are already here . - Do you ? - I think it 's possible . Yes . That 's why I sent for you . I need your advice . You 'd be well paid for your time . Well , that 'll be a novelty . Let 's look at a few facts . In less than a year , five men , each one an expert in his own particular field , have disappeared without a trace . The only one to turn up did so last week . Oh , yeah , that was Dr. Markham . He was found in New Mexico . Apparently insane . Please don 't turn around , Mr. Vincent . I asked you to sit in the front so you could use that mirror . Can you see the car behind us ? I believe it 's a grey sedan this time . Yesterday , it was an ice cream truck following us . Tomorrow it 'll be a little old lady on a bicycle . I told you about him . Mr. Vincent , I 've been followed for some time now . I believe it 's because my disappearance is being planned . By aliens . By enemies of some kind . I believe by aliens . Yes . Look at the fields represented by the men I 've just mentioned : Uh , Markham , oceanography . Wannamaker , mathematics . Uh , Millington , psychology . Robley , military science . And just last month , Bill Hastings from Cal Tech . Add it up , Mr. Vincent , and tell me what you get . A pattern . Congratulations , Warren , you finally made a sale . Your grey sedan didn 't make the turn , Warren . He knows where we 're going . They 've tailed me to the plant often enough . Well , what do you think ? Well , Mr. Doneghan , if they have a list , it figures you 'd be on it . From what I understand , you 're the best in your field . All right , assuming they 're only waiting for the right moment , what would you advise ? Well , sir , that depends upon what you have in mind . Preventing it , or something else . Morning , Mr. Doneghan . Mr. Wiley . Morning . This is David Vincent . - I 'll sign the clearance . - All right , sir . - Thank you , sir . - Right . You said there was something else I could do . What is it ? Let it happen . Let them take you . Follow them . Tom ? You know how I feel . If I were you , I 'd knock this off right now and give this gentleman cab fare back to town . Take Mr. Vincent to the commissary . I 'll give you my decision later . This way , please . I don 't understand . I simply don 't understand . Well , it 's really not all that complicated , Eve . It 's just that something has come up which may make it necessary for me to leave town suddenly , that 's all . For how long ? I 'm not sure . I only told you so that if it happens you won 't worry . Why all this sudden concern for my feelings ? Not that it isn 't refreshing . You 're making a whole lot out of nothing , Eve . Believe me . If you 'll excuse me , I 'd like to shower before dinner . - Warren . - Eve , I 've told you all I can . All you need to know . Now , leave it alone , please . All right , Warren , we 'll have it your way . I won 't insist . Tom , would you do me a favour ? Yeah . Would you take Eve to the Morrison 's party tonight ? I feel pretty tired . Yeah , sure . Eve , trust me , please . What 's her name , Tom ? Never mind . You wouldn 't tell me anyway . Oh , yes , I would , if it were true . You 'd be surprised how selfish I can really be . He doesn 't have a girl , Eve . Believe me . I don 't . I 've suspected it for quite a while . Now I 'm sure . I 'm finished with him , Tom . Yeah , I 've heard that story before . I know . I mean it now . This time , I really mean it . Now , if I 'm gonna take you to the party , I better go home and change . Now , after I saw you yesterday , we had this video recording made . It 's rough , but it 'll give you an idea of the route I take from here to my home . Why the change in cars ? Well , Friday is Tom 's day off . I drive to and from work alone . WARREN : Chances are , that 's when they 'll hit . Now , that 's a shortcut . Saves me about 20 minutes . Are there any turnoffs on this road ? - None . - Well , that 's about it . We have the probable time and place . Now , supposing something goes wrong and we lose you . [ BEEPING ] What kind of a range does this have ? About 40 miles . - What if we use the helicopter ? WARREN : You can double it . That 's the most powerful transmitter for its size ever made . My own patent . And where do you figure on hiding it ? Well , I could tape it on here , maybe , huh ? No , no , Warren . It wouldn 't work . The first thing they 'd do is search you for weapons . Right there . [ CHUCKLES ] You 'd never guess Tom 's an ex-cop , would you ? What 's that around your neck ? Oh , that 's a St. Christopher 's medal . Of course , why not ? I 'll have one made up . I still think the police should be brought in on this . No . The police would never let me try this . We have to do it alone , just the three of us . Something wrong , Vincent ? Why ? I know you were sweating it out . What made up your mind to stick your neck out like this ? To risk my life ? Well , maybe I 'm just doing it for publicity . You made four national magazines last month . Let me ask you a question . Why are you doing it ? Let 's drop it , huh ? [ RADIO BEEPING ] Five twenty-three . He should be getting into his car right now . There , he 's making a turn onto Grant Boulevard . [ VEHICLE APPROACHING ] [ RADIO BEEPING LOUDER ] Here he comes . Right on time . - He won 't be able to get past that van . - I know . Sorry , mister . We seem to be having some trouble . We ought to be out of here in- - Let 's go . [ ENGINE STALLING ] [ EXPLOSION ] Tom . Tom . Mr. Wiley , there 's a young lady calling you . Who 's she ? That 's Doneghan 's wife . I called her when I called for the cab . She had a right to know . Eve , I felt I had to call you- - That will help him a lot . Who did it ? Why did he let it happen ? Oh , Tom , I ... Well , what 's it all about ? It 's a long story , Eve . There 's no time now . We 'll get him back . Are you sure you want to ? You know something , Eve ? I think I 'm a lot more certain of that than you are . Tom , I 'm sorry . Forgive me ? [ HELICOPTER WHIRRING ] Let 's give it a half hour . If we don 't pick up the signal , we 'll head for Tucson . That hospital where they 're keeping Dr. Markham is right outside of town . He 's our last lead . There 's no point in hoping , Mr. Doneghan . Hoping for what ? Your friends . They 're not coming . Not now . Not ever . DOCTOR : Dr. Markham 's been that way ever since we brought him in . And he said nothing ? Not a word ? We had one session with him shortly after he got here . - It 's on tape . - Can I hear it ? It 's important . All right , follow me . MARKHAM [ ON RECORDER ] : They 're not people , not like us . DOCTOR [ ON RECORDER ] : Who ? Who 's not like us , Dr. Markham ? MARKHAM [ ON RECORDER ] : Not human . Oh , God , what they did to us- - Terrible pain . Oh , please . Please , no . Leeches . They 're leeches . I 've gotta get out . I 've gotta get out . I 've gotta get- - DOCTOR [ ON RECORDER ] : Are you all right ? That 's nothing , doctor , just something to calm you down . MARKHAM [ ON RECORDER ] : They 've got Hastings and Wannamaker . All of them . You 've got to save them . Don 't you understand ? They 're- - They 're buried in hell . How can you do this ? What kind of beings are you ? What kind of- - ? No . No , don 't do it anymore . Not anymore . No . No . [ MARKHAM CRYING ON RECORDER ] Is that all ? Those were the last words he said . " Buried in hell . " Where exactly was he found in New Mexico ? About 40 miles north of Silver City . In case you 're interested , we passed over Silver City a half hour ago . [ RADIO BEEPING ] That 's it . We got it . Head left . More left . Keep going . [ MACHINES BEEPING ] [ BEEPING RAPIDLY ] [ BEEPING STOPS ] I 've got some good news for you , pal . I don 't think we 've got enough fuel left to take us to the nearest airport . Let 's keep going for a while . Look , Vincent , I can 't fly this thing on your nerve . Just give me 10 minutes , will you ? We were going in the right direction when we lost the signal . The longer we stay up , the better chance we have of spotting something . All right , 10 minutes more and that 's it . [ DOOR OPENING ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] Aren 't you Hastings ? Bill Hastings , from Cal Tech ? My name is Hastings , yes . Whoever you are , I 'm sorry to see you here . Well , I 'm Warren Doneghan . We worked together last year on the coast . I think I remember you , yes . Was that only last- - ? Was that only last year ? What have they done to you , Bill ? Hm ? Well , I 'll tell you , even though you 'll find out for yourself soon enough . They put you in a chair and attach a metal helmet to your head . It hurts . Hurts from deep inside . The machines- - The machines probe the brain , literally . They take from it whatever knowledge they want . A lifetime of learning and experiment , and they take it from you , a bit at a time . Now , listen to me . I 'm not here by accident . I 'm working with others . They 'll be trying to find me . And if they do , we 're going to need your help . [ DOOR OPENING ] Well , I gotta hand it to you , Vincent . - This was a great idea . It really was . - Don 't worry , we 'll find him . He shouldn 't have talked to you in the first place . You 're really eaten up about him , aren 't you ? I could see that back at the heliport with his wife . I 'm sorry . We 've been at this a long time without sleep . So forgive me . You had every right to say it . It 's the truth . I 've been in love with Eve for over a year . This is none of my business . Just leave me out of it , huh ? He 's been my best friend for a long time . Ever since the landings at Pusan . We were in Korea together . Look , I never wanted to fall for his wife . A guy like him has no business getting married . He lives and breathes and sleeps with that factory . There 's no time in his life left for her . It 's not her fault . I was around , I loved her and she knew it . She was upset when this went wrong just as much as I was . And for the same reason . She had wished so many times that she could be free of him . Then when he was kidnapped she went all to pieces . But you didn 't . I 'm not the type . You know something , Vincent , I don 't believe in being dedicated to something I can 't really believe in . And it 's taken me 20 hours to realise I don 't really believe we 're ever gonna find Doneghan . So you 're just gonna quit ? Yeah , that 's what I 'm gonna do . We 've lost him thanks to you , and right now , Eve needs me a lot more than you do . Just like that . No conscience , no remorse . Who do you think you 're talking to , Vincent , some schoolboy ? Well , I got news for you , pal . Life is no Sunday school picnic . You take what you can get when you can get it . And right now , I 'm taking . There 's a highway about three miles back . I 'll catch a ride . See you . [ YELLING ] Help me . Help . Help . Help me . Hold it right there . It 's all right . It 's all right . I 'm not gonna hurt you . Who are you ? I 'm a friend . Did you escape from them ? My name is Millington . Professor Arthur Millington . Please help me . You will help me ? Yes , I 'll help you . But first you have to show me where they kept you . No . I won 't go back there . Look , there are other men there who have to be freed . I know you 're scared , but you 've got to take me there . Do you understand that ? You 've got to take me back . You can do no good . There are too many of them and they are too strong . You don 't have to go all the way . Just close enough to show me where they kept you . Just give me a minute . I 'm so tired . So very tired . This place you want , you can see it just over that rise . [ GUNSHOTS SOUND ] What was that thing down there ? Called himself Millington . It was an alien . That 's how they die here on Earth . Where did you come from ? I changed my mind . I was wandering around looking for you , I spotted this jeep tearing across the desert . Suddenly , it stopped and- - To let this , whatever it is , off , right in the middle of nowhere . Then the jeep turned around and took off . It didn 't make sense . Where did the jeep come from ? Take a look . TOM : It 's a mining camp . Or what 's left of it . Looks like it 's been deserted for years . " Buried in hell . " What ? Just remembering what Dr. Markham said : " They 're buried in hell . " That must be what he meant . The mine . It seems to me we can stay out of sight pretty much all the way . Yeah , we better get moving before they start missing their buddy . I 'm glad you came back , Tom . I 'm glad too . So far , that is . He 's not back yet ? [ GRUNTS ] [ SQUEAKING ] [ MACHINE BEEPING ] [ GRUNTS ] I 'm all right . Come on , let 's get out of here . Bill , we 're gonna leave this place now . Come on . Come on . We 'll have to come back for him . [ MACHINE BEEPING ] Hey . [ GRUNTING ] [ EXPLOSION ] Come on , hurry up . Never go back . Keep going . Vincent ! TOM : Vincent ! [ COUGHS ] Hey , Warren . Welcome back . - How long has it been ? - Oh , three days . - Mm . - How do you feel ? Don 't bother to answer that . Tom didn 't make it . And neither did Wannamaker . And the mine , there 's nothing left at all . Just debris . Warren , we 've got to go to Washington . I 've been there . They listened . They were very polite . I even got them to send an investigator out to the place . Wasn 't there anything ? No real evidence at all . Well , what about the kidnapping ? The men we go out of the mine ? Washington 's ready to admit that there was some kind of a plot , they 'll go that far . I mean , we were kidnapped for some reason by somebody . But who ? And why ? Oh , they said they 'd investigate based on the evidence . And as for Hastings and the real Arthur Millington , you know , the two we managed to get out ? They 're worse than Markham . Their minds gone ? [ SIGHS ] Was it worth it , what we did ? Yes . We destroyed what they were doing and we destroyed them . Get well , David , and don 't quit . I won 't . I don 't intend to . I 'm counting on that . How 's your wife ? She 's all right . I love her , you know ? I 'm gonna do my best to convince her of that . NARRATOR 2 : Two men with their eyes on the heavens , who now share a common knowledge . Together they have faced the invader . Together they have learned the grave threat he represents to the human race . And now , as they again pursue their separate destinies , they remain , more than ever , men with their eyes on the heavens .

Ladies and Gentlemen , the Big Hunt 's rules are , the global moral institution , which moralized this century and which has chained and legalized violence : R ule no . 1 : e very member has to commit to carry out ten hunts . Five as a hunter and five as a victim , alternating , each time chosen by a computer in Geneva . Hey ! Rule no . 2 : the hunter knows e verything about his victim , name , address , habits . Boo ! Rule no . 3 : the victim does not know who his hunter is . He must locate him ... and crush him . Rule no . 4 : the winner of e very single hunt has the right to a prize .

Come on , Thomas , hurry up ! You 're tickling me . Hello ? Marcello ... do you know what I dreamt ? That you already got your annulment , but didn 't tell me . Dreams are strange , aren 't the y ? I think I 'll call your wife , at least she 'll tell me the truth . With you , no one can understand a thing . Hello ? Marcello ! We remind a / / members of the organization ... that the dead / ine for the hunting / icense is about to expire . To avoid the danger of big wars , register for the Big Hunt . On / y the Big Hunt can give you a sense of safety . Come on , come on ! What did this one do ? I nstead of a Borsini he killed a Corsini . That means 30 years in prison . A study of history confirms the validity of the Big Hunt theory ... it is mankind 's safety valve . And if in 1940 the Big Hunt had e xisted ... Hitler would 've been a member and we could ha ve a voided WWI I. Now all is resolved , wars are o ver and the violent instincts of man can now be e xpressed by a single and set competition . Marcello Poletti . I 'm here to collect for the sixth hunt . THE PRIZE WAS WITHDRAWN B Y MR S. LI DIA POLETTI The annulment was 6 da ys ago . Didn 't the y tell you ? No . When did she withdraw it ?

R esidence of the victim : R ome , Italy . Communicate to the hunter all data related to the victim . Can 't we get St. Peter ? After all , the Pope is American , modern . And me dressed as a nun ? I 'm up for shooting at the Studio ? Get that idea out of your head ! Just as we see R ome 's plazas , domes , fountains , ruins ... you want to lock yourself in a pla yhouse ? Let 's not fool ourselves , the Vatican wouldn 't allow it , the y 're against the Big Hunt . Yes , but I ha ve friends , we could try and ask for an e x ception . It would be great to mo ve around in a place like that . I went there on my hone ymoon with my 18th wife . Sorry , but I prefer the Studio . - Oh my ! - Stop it . Come on ! It 's crazy to come to R ome and shoot on a stage ! - It would be great in that square ! - Sure ! It can be done . I magine Poletti 's corpse in the center fountain . Wait a minute ! I 've got a great idea ... The Colosseum ! Very good ! This wa y we 'll also ha ve gladiators on TV . But , we can 't go o ver budget . The gladiators won 't cost much plus , ancient R ome alwa ys worked well on the American market . Yes , and the remaining gladiators would kill each other off , in order to entertain the R omans . Listen , let 's not complicate things . It 's better if we shoot at the Studio . Plus , don 't forget , the costumes are ready . I would Io ve to be Cleopatra , though . What does Cleopatra ha ve to do with the Colosseum ? Besides , how would we shoot it there ? Look , look down there ! It 's all full of holes ! Yes , yes . Ma ybe you 're right . It 's too run down . How are the y going to fight ? The y 're not a herd of sheep ! We ha ve to find another place ! Wait a minute , look ! There , Caroline ! - That 's where you ha ve to kill him ! - Perfect ! We 'll ha ve the Colosseum in the background and the space we need ! What is it called ? - The temple of Venus ! - I 'll kill him here . Ma y I come in ? - Who are you ? - Don 't be afraid . It 's us ! Confiscation . How are you Mr. Poletti ? Fine . Make yourself comfortable . You could ha ve notified me at least . And so ? The bed sta ys with me by law . You also ha ve a right to a chair and a table . Like the last time . If you don 't mind , take the TV last . The tele vision last , as you wish . You are alwa ys hunting , right , Mr. Poletti ? I am a fan of those hunts . I know all about you , lucky you ! Washington . I n America an exp / osive cookie was / aunched ... - What are you doing ? - Ex ecutive confiscation .

A doll ? - Oh my , is he a se x maniac ? - Ah , it could be . What 's going on ? The y 're hitting each other ! Look how calm he is . - But , who are those people ? - Students discussing art . Are you sure he was notified ? Let me check . Look , he 's going to the usual place . Just as planned . If you hurry , you can catch him there . Hunting Ministry I nformation ? Could you please tell me , if number B 2 738 , Poletti , Marcello , received his regular hunting notice ? He 's been notified . - Everything is set . - Is this place for men only ? I don 't know . There 's a snack bar upstairs where he eats e veryda y . Anybody can go there . Come on , go ! Hurry ! - Follow them , Chet . - Alright . Hello , hello ! Chet here ! - Martin here . What 's the status ? - The y 're in front of the snack bar . Poletti has arrived and Caroline has joined him on the terrace . Over ! - Good , watch them ! Over . - Oka y , o ver and out ! What do you want ? I am American . I feel lonely . I want someone to talk to , but if I 'm bothering you ... See , you 've guessed right , you are bothering me . - My name is Caroline Meredith . - So ? Are you busy tonight ? I 'll probably be dead tonight . You are very bra ve to e xpose yourself this wa y . No , I just don 't ha ve enough mone y to defend myself . Well , since it 's about sa ving your life , I think ... Good luck ! Ex cuse me . Stop , stop ! You can 't . You can 't ... you can 't shoot here . - You can 't shoot in bars ? - Please , sir . - Since when ? - The first of the month . We e ven put up a sign . Look into it before going on a hunt ! I give you a one minute lead . What kind of life this is ... You can 't shoot in hospitals , nor in resta urants . You can 't shoot in churches nor at the barber 's . You can 't shoot at nursery schools ... You can 't shoot anywhere anymore ! Then end this hunt , I tell you ! Well , bye . - Good luck ! - Thanks , same to you . Sorry ... but , once I saw one loaded with a Colt 45 . I n America there aren 't many restrictions for hunters . Everyone can easily shoot where ver and whene ver he wants to . America is something else . Answer it . - Hello . - Marcello Poletti ? No , sorry , Mr. Poletti isn 't here . Damn ! - Was that oka y ? - Thanks . Mr. Poletti ! I want to relax . - Oriental or Northern ? - Northern . - Subscriber ? - No , cash . Sign here . Hi there . Hea vy , pop or very soft music ? Bleached , huh ? This is the first time I 've seen you here . My name is Astrid . What are you used to ? Do you want some special setting ? I ha ve a very stimulating wolf 's howl in the storm . Or , would you prefer the take-off of a huge missile ? Or , can I offer you a nice rustling sound of underwear ? You 're difficult , aren 't you ? Come on , darling , rest your head on my breast . I know a fairytale , Little R ed Riding Hood . Want to hear it ? - Did I ask you to speak ? - No . I came here to think , period . I just wanted to please you , but , if silence arouses you , I do as you wish . Why are you following me ? What do you want from me ? - Do you ha ve just a couple minutes ? - No , I don 't . - Listen ... - I 'm busy . I came to R ome to conduct an inquiry on the se xual conduct of Italian men . That 's why I 'm following you . I don 't want to talk . Why ? Beca use there is no se xual conduct , nor a man . Look , I represent millions of unsatisfied American women . This is a live interview , I 'd like to ask you something ... ha ve an e xperience , question you on TV at the temple of Venus . Come on , sa y yes ! But , why me ? Beca use , I prefer difficult men like you . Please , don 't disappoint me . You 'll come to the temple of Venus ? Here , done . Ninety pulsations . Not bad . How many beats did you count , Marcello ? How many beats did you count ? Twenty-five . It used to be fifty . You 're out of shape . Yes , yes , I know . - Do you want to train ? - It 's useless . Marcello , you 're a bundle of nerves . I 'll die , aren 't you happy ? I know you 'll die , but the important thing is how one dies . As a rabbit , or as a Samurai ? Aim high , imbecile ! After a 48 hour hunt nothing has happened , I 'm nervous . There are two possibilities : he 's either on his wa y , or he 's here now , driving you crazy . Do you ha ve an armored vest ? Are you armed ? You feel too sorry for yourself . You 're reckless , remember that the selection is cruel . Only fifteen hunters in the entire world ha ve made it through all ten hunts . Marcello ... Marcello , wait ! You ha ve to pa y me . You still ha ve to pa y me for 15 training sessions at the gym . You ha ve to give me the mone y ! Are you gonna pa y ? Ne xt time . Ah , ne xt time ... if there is e ver going to be a ne xt time ! Come on , touch the iron , touch the iron . Not the good hand ! There is no curare . Bastard ! The good hand , of course . - Hello , Caroline ? - Yes . We 've lost him as well . Ma ybe that 's good . We 're not ready yet . Over . This is a great e xample of disorganization . Over . Some disorganization ne ver hurts . Over . Well , ma ybe it 's due to the R oman air . Over . Something will happen . Over . I hope so . Out . I called all the hotels . Two Me xicans went down at the Ex celsior . The maid sa ys the y 're unarmed . Ma ybe the y are refugees . At the Ambasciatori hotel about 20 R ussians from the cooperative societies went to see the Pope . Listen , I ... Why aren 't the y picking up the corpses ? Look at that . I 'll sleep at your house for a few nights . - Did you fight with Olga ? - No , but I want to end it . I need to reco ver . Give me an injection , come on ! Did you tell her about the annulment ? No , what are you thinking ? Let 's go ! An American wants to interview me at the temple . She 'll pa y . - What 's her name ? - Caroline Meredith . She seems strange . Do you know anything ? I know ... she 's sta ying at the Hilton with a group of Americans . The y work for the news media . The y 're unarmed . Are you sure ? If I 'm telling you , it means I know . - The left or right side ? - I don 't remember . Let me do a count . One week ago we did the left side , Monda y , Tuesda y , Wednesda y , Thursda y , Frida y , Saturda y , Sunda y ... On the left ! R eady ? Did you find him again ? Yes , we found him . He 's at the beach . Where ? - With the sun worshippers . - East of Fiumicino ? Yes . - Shall I send Caroline back then ? - Yes , let her know . But there 's time , Poletti 's resting and he still needs to get ready . - There is time until sunset . - Oka y . Agreed . Sta y in touch . Over and out . Hello , Caroline . Tell me , darling . As soon as you can , turn back around . Poletti has gone to the sunset worshippers . Where are those sunset worshippers ? Look at the map we ga ve you . East of Fiumicino , there 's an arrow that points to the e xact place . You 've got until sunset . Over and out . Good e vening . Brothers . Are you still insisting with that stupid inquiry ? You 're so unpredictable that I want to follow you . If you want something good , go with them . A very emotional e vent , there 's nothing funny about it . Ha ve a good da y . Toda y the da ylight will be gone by 7 : 30 pm . Contemplation of the sunset . We were born by chance . But , fortunately , we 'll die by chance . This last ra y of light is reaching us from 149,000,000 km . Our Father is lea ving , we see him die with our own e yes . But we can 't despair . Our tears are purifying . The y free us from the anguish of e very da y , and while we 're watching the passing of this belo ved friend , our brothers in California are welcoming His birth in the morning . Let 's focus now . The magical moment is about to strike ! I n ten , nine , eight , se ven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Perverts ! Go awa y ! We 'll give you the sunset ! I mbeciles ! Go home ! We don 't want you here ! We 're sick of you ! Go ! Go ! Don 't e ver come back ! We 'll make you cry ! No , brothers ... don 't be bothered by those nasty neo-realists . Cry , brothers ! Cry ! Free yourself , free yourself ! What 's up , are you crying ? Ha ve you ne ver seen a sunset ? Yes , as a child , but I had forgotten . Brothers , sisters ! Thank you . Now , go my brothers , go to the sea . Purify yourselves ! Marcello , are you going for a swim with us ? No , I can 't tonight . But I 'm there with you in spirit . Go , go . I see you 're crying , also . Of course , I took two crying pills . The y last for at least 15 minutes . You don 't belie ve in what you 're sa ying , do you ? I ha ve to belie ve in it . I get 20 % of the profits . You should ha ve seen what happened at the ina uguration . Even the therapists checked it out . The tele vision , newspapers ... Those wicked neo-realists ruined me completely ! Well , why don 't you stop then ? What is this , an interview or plain curiosity ? One or the other . R eally ? Everything has a price . How much will you pa y ? Three hundred dollars . Four hundred , five hundred . If you want , e ven a thousand . How long will this take ? One hour . Ma ybe two . And where should it take place ? At the temple of Venus , near the Colosseum . But , isn 't it late now ? No , we work all night . We 've got lots to do . Isn 't there an advance ? Oh , I see , you trust me . Five hundred dollars . Good . I 'll get dressed right awa y and we 'll go to R ome . Oka y ? Wait . Look . She 's making signals . It would be ideal to kill her now . If she 's not your hunter , that 's 30 years in prison . If she is my hunter , great ! If not , the y 'll take her for a drowned sun worshipper . It 's worked before . Then tell me why she hasn 't tried to kill you yet . I don 't know ! But she 's the only one following me . - Why has no one else tried to kill me ? - It could be tactics . The clue lies in the temple of Venus . She insists on taking me there . Oka y , Marcello , let 's do this ... I 'll go to the temple and look around . I 'll meet you at Lidia 's . - I n one hour . - Oka y . Ma y I ask why you signed up for the Big Hunt ? For the mone y , obviously . And I alwa ys thought that life is too long . - Age ? - Middle . - Profession ? - All of them . Married ? You know what the Sacred R oman R ota is ? It 's the court of matrimony . Get married in Italy . You 'll find out . Three da ys ago I got the annulment for my marriage . I 've waited 6 years for this ruling . Are you getting married again ? - No , I wouldn 't e ven if I were dead . - Why ? I 've already e xperienced it . Don 't you see what it has reduced me to ? Well , it must be beca use of this particular ... family circumstance that you don 't defend yourself . You really want to die ? Don 't try to understand e verything at once . Could you at least tell me where I am ? At my wife 's house . I need just a couple of minutes . Hear that ? A couple of minutes . Tell e veryone to stand by . Come on , hurry up . Wait , wait . Looks like it 's all mine . Now , it 's all my wife 's . Lidia ! Would you like pop or soft music ? Just piano music . - Would you like an aphrodisiac ? - A mild one , if you ha ve it . What are you doing ? You keep it in the safe ? No , I 'm looking for something more e x citing , mone y . Enough with this game . Serve yourself . Sorry , but these sunsets wear me out . I don 't know what else to do to make mone y . Three minutes of relaxation . What do you mean , three minutes to relax ? Look , we ha ve to go to the temple of Venus . Poletti ... he y ! Poletti ! My Hea vens , what a Io vely creature ! Step forward , Miss . Don 't hold back . - Would you like some coffee ? - Sure , some coffee ... - She could be a spy ! - What spy ? ! Calm down , mom . I knew it , you are a spy from the nursing home ! Marcello , don 't hurt her ! That 's not true ! I am a reporter . Why should I care about your parents ? The prize is useful to e veryone ! What are you doing with your parents ? I don 't understand . Why ha ven 't you turned them o ver to the State yet ? I n Italy , we belie ve in the patriarchal family system . Almost nobody turns them o ver to the State . We keep them hidden . We often fix them up ... - To look like teenagers . - Like teenagers ? A son 's Io ve that intense is incredible ! You really Io ve them this much ? No . It 's the obligation that bothers me . If you 're not a go vernment agent , you 're my hunter . Come on , make up your mind . Come on ... let 's get it o ver with . Quickly , though . Why on earth do you ha ve to dramatize e verything ? Come on ... why do you think I would want to kill you ? I understand your situation . The hunt , the wife , the mone y ... If you want to win , you must be calmer ... and more serene . Don 't get so agitated . It 's not good for you . Would you like a little massage ? I 'm good at this . How did you solve the problem with your parents ? I 'm from Hoboken , the fertilization center . You 're good at giving massages . Are you ticklish ? - You are very se xual , are you ? - A real ball of fire . How I envy you . Shall we ha ve this ... this e xperience ? La y down . I can 't feel a thing . Count to 100 , if you like . I 'm an iceberg . Yes , sure , you ha ve a nice technique , but ... I should attend a class on light erotica . But , that 's so demoralizing . Especially the learned part . Many fall for it . Why don 't you shut up . How can I get to work , if you talk ? Marcello ... Sorry to disturb you . Oh , Lidia , it 's you , don 't worry , sta y . Caroline , let me introduce my wife , Lidia . - Ex ... e x-wife . - Right . You should at least ha ve notified me . You know what happened ? Olga called me and I told her that we got the annulment . Is that oka y ? When are you gonna shut up ? She 'll ha ve her cards ready ! Of course , after all these years . Besides , you promised her you would marry her . You e ven forced us to become friends with each other . She 's alwa ys here with me . I forced you ? You two are the sick ones ! I feel fond of her for wanting to marry you . - Are you looking for something ? - My prize mone y . - I told you that I 've already spent it . - All of it ? Of course , all of it . I n order for me to get married again ... I need to buy something for myself , right ? Plus , I ha ve to care for your parents . Don 't think that this doesn 't cost anything ! Two elderly people . Should we turn them o ver to the State ? Marcello ! Who are you ? He 's here with you . That 's why he 's hiding . Right ? There 's no answer . He doesn 't tell me about the annulment . Ex cuse me . What do you want from me ? I 've been waiting years for this annulment , get it ? And now there 's you . You think you can change his life . I 'll kill you both ! - There must be some mistake ... - I spent millions for this story ! I was that young when it all started ! Not in my house , cool it . Fool ! Marcello sends his regards . He just left . It 's not as simple an inquiry as she wants you to belie ve . I think she is planning something weird . I think it 's a trap . You 'll soon find out yourself . Be careful , though ! Wait for me here . Be careful ! Ex cuse me , is this the temple of Venus ? - Yes , of course . - Thank you . - Did Caroline call ? - She 's coming . Keep him busy . He y , one of your agents paid me for an interview , but ... we lost sight of each other and ha ven 't been able to find each other . Can we interview without the girl ? Sorry , no . But Caroline will be here any moment . Martin , do you know anything ? Yes , I know she 's coming , and she 's usually on time . Well , since you 're not ready , I 'll return the advance . Oh , it 's not important if the interview doesn 't happen now . - We 're in no hurry , right , Cole ? - Certainly . Tonight , tomorrow ... We 're alwa ys here . Would you like something to drink ? Yes , let 's ha ve a drink . Whisky ? - Vodka ? - Sambuca ? Anywa y , in case Miss Caroline still needs me , she can find me at the Big Hunt Club . - Well , it 's only a matter of minutes . - Listen ... At the Big Hunt Club , at midnight . Cut ! You 're right . The TV interview gets me here so she can kill me for publicity ! - A tournament , huh ? - Yes , like a tournament . Yes , the Americans are alwa ys ahead of us . I heard the y tried the same sort of thing in Milan . The only one who would go out of his mind for an idea like this is Silvestri . What idea ? I 'll kill her for a product , too ! Get it ? How can I organize e verything in one night ? I don 't care . Do what you want . That 's what I 'm pa ying for . Yeah , right ! It 's been months since I 've seen a dime ! - Sta y with me , you 'll get the profit ! - Right , the profit . But , it 's difficult in one night . How can it be done ? Hello ? I 'd like to speak the commander . - I 'll get him right away , just a second . - Thank y ou . We 're lucky , Chet . Yes , hello , I 'm here . Commander , I 'm attorne y R ossi , Poletti 's assistant , - You heard of him ... - Ah ! The hunt ! Precisely , the Big Hunt ! I 'd like to propose a big publicity stunt for your product with your swimming pool , a crocodile , and the killing ... of an American girl . To me , the idea of killing someone ... for publicity alwa ys seemed to be a very amusing idea . Do you know what worries me ? That a woman would be killed . - Why ? - It might not be good for sales . I nsist on it ! If we 'd kill someone else ... ? That 's impossible . I 'll tell you , this year it 's trendy to kill women . It 's not important who dies , but how one dies . Tell him that people want a spectacle . As you know , toda y people only go for the spectacle . Yes , true , but I 'd like to think about it . Commander , we prefer you , but we can 't waste any time . Yes or no ! Alright then . Come and see me right awa y . - Ex cellent ! - Right awa y , though . All right . - He 's waiting for us at the villa . - Let 's go . Keep clear ! Please , keep clear ! Let us through , please , keep clear . Careful , don 't get near it . It 's dangerous . I take no responsibility . - This is a great animal ! - Yes , yes . Come , Poletti . Bea utiful , isn 't it ? Careful , please . All right , here , put it down . Gently , gently . It has to eat one girl ? Don 't worry , it ' can eat three . It 's terrible ! - You 're sure ? - Certainly . - It 'll break her backbone right awa y . - Perfect . Plus , it has another e x ceptional characteristic . He 's the only crocodile that doesn 't cry after the meals . Speed ? 80 kilometers at the moment of immersion . - Aren 't you putting it in ? - Not now . At the last minute . Tomorrow morning I 'll lea ve for Milan . The filming has to be finished tonight . - All right . - You can count on it . Marcello , the contract ... it 's getting late ! Put the crocodile in the gazebo for now . I 'm forgetting something . What slogan will you read , Poletti ? - R ead it . - Ah , yes . Let 's see ... At the killing of the hunter , Caroline Meredith , the undersigned Marcello Poletti lifts the cup filled with your product and clearly repeats the following slogan with a courteous and inviting smile : " You 'll alwa ys win with Coca 80 . " Good . We 're ready . Let 's go . The advance ! Miss Caroline has to sit here . Look , are you sure this will work ? Sure . - Let 's try it . - As you wish . You pla y the girl . - Well , I really ... - Sit down ! Are we sure the crocodile isn 't in there ? Come , the machine is here . Don 't worry , it 's a test . What can I sa y ? You only ha ve to push this button . Come on . I beg you , commander . Poletti , push the button . Please , sir . No , Caroline I think he 's still unsure as to whether you 're his hunter . I admit he ma y be suspicious at most . Well , if so , then tell me why he put me in his wife 's house and came to the temple all by himself . He escaped in a hurry . He is in a lot of trouble . With those women tormenting him ... you should know , you ca ught a couple of punches . He knew very well where I was , but asked for me anywa y . No , he didn 't ask for you . He said he 'd lost sight of you . He figured that without you nothing could be done . He e ven tried to give the mone y back . You know what I sa y ? We can do whate ver we want . It 's as if we ha ve it in the bag . He 's too stupid ! Yet , I 'm sure , as soon as he sees me , he 'll shoot me . The one place where he cannot shoot you is the Hunt Club . You can go there without a problem . Good . I 'll go there . Give me my clothes . We need to come up with something to confuse him , to make him belie ve that the hunter is someone else . Pistol . Chet , you ha ve to shoot at him without hitting him . Oka y ? ! Good . All right . - Be careful not to get recognized . - Of course . - Act as if you 're his hunter . - Understood . Come Caroline , hurry up . Let 's go ! I ha ve another idea . Get me a young and handsome guy . Big Hunt Club - Chet here . Over . - Martin here . Over . Mission accomplished . What now ? I 'm not going out with you anymore . I don 't belie ve this guy . He was sent here to trick us . A real hunter wouldn 't ha ve missed ! Caroline should ha ve arrived . Sta y here , keep an e ye out . Marcello , she 's coming with another guy . - With another guy ? - Yes . And he is not American . You 've got little time . - We 're to see the crocodile at 4 : 00 . - Go awa y ! You 're a wimp and a coward ! Your life isn 't worth a penny to me . Can I consider myself free ? It 's up to you . And the interview at the temple of Venus ? You 're too busy . Besides , I prefer R udy . Ma ybe he 's not so interesting ? Isn 't it true , R udy , that you 're less interesting ? But he 's nice and simple . That solves e verything , right ? I 'll e ven let you keep the advance . Poor Marcello , ca ught between his troubles with women , Io vers , priests , hunters . I considered you the wild great male icon , you monster ! - Are you joking ? - No , I 'm not joking . - Disappointed , huh ? - Yes , very much . For an instant you showed me something new at your home . Then y our wife and that other one arrived , and y ou ran away like a child ! I 've a proposal for you , listen ... Ma ybe , in a more romantic setting ... Come on . There 's a villa on Appia Antica , with a great pool . Let 's go there , oka y ? No . The spell is broken , don 't you think ? Oh , how cute . The crocodile . I like effeminate guys . The y 're the ideal friends for women . The y keep you company . Ha ve you e ver been one ? Why do you despise men so much ? No , I actually like them a lot , but then , once you get to that point , it becomes impossible . Where are you going ? To work . To the temple of Venus . What happened ? She 's doing the interview with the other guy . Well , then it really is an interview and has nothing to do with the hunt . I n the end , your hunter really was the one shooting at you . Be on guard , Marcello . I kept an e ye on you all e vening . You two are falling in Io ve . Ming tea makes better Io vers ! Ming tea makes better Io vers ! Yes , only Ming tea makes better Io vers ! No , she 's got nothing to do with the hunt , patience ! - What can you do ? - Careful , think . The interview with R udy ma y be a trick . Women are smart , Marcello ! Think hard . She arrives , follows you , pa ys you , you see her making signals at night , and then ... does e verything to get you here . No , no , no . If you weren 't 100 % convinced , why didn 't you sa y so ? But , how ... how could I ? It was just a guess ! A victim ne ver has the e xact information . What will we tell them ? You took the advance ! The y 're waiting for us , you ha ve to decide ! Sa y what you want , make something up , dela y it ! I ha ve to be sure before I kill her . Understand ? Or it 's 30 years in prison for me ! Go . There she is . Go awa y . Hide ! Caroline ! He fell for it , go , go . According to you I 'm a wimp and a coward , why ? - It 's obvious . Beca use y ou are afraid . - Of who ? Of me . Would you like to get in ? He y , you guys ! Come here . Come back . Go awa y ! I 'll follow them by car . Hurry ! - Do you Io ve her ? - Who ? Olga , your Io ver . No . Then why don 't you tell her ? It would be far simpler and cleaner ! R elationships should be truthful ! But , who wants the truth ? Nobody likes the truth . It 's better this wa y , with the lies and deceptions . I blush when I tell the truth . Do you like the truth ? Just wait . Hello ? Hello , Olga . Marcello , where are you ? I 've been looking for you all da y ! Listen to me . Oddly enough , tonight I want to tell the truth . How come ? Well , listen closely . As you know , I 've gotten the annulment . - Yes , Lidia told me . - Right ... but I won 't marry you . When I find you , Marcello ... you 'll pa y for this ! It 's that American woman 's fa ult ! It has been so many years , and now you dump me ! I 'll kill you both ! I 'll get a machine gun and sla ughter you ! Now that I 've told the truth , is there a prize ? What a bea utiful night , Marcello ! I feel great . - Can I tell you something ? - What ? Did you know , in New York , after a night like this ... a penny is put in a machine , and then , two people like us ... Bingo ! The y 're husband and wife . But , we 're not in New York . Ex cuse me , Caroline , but let 's be straight . I n Italy almost nobody gets married , it 's not worth it . Divorce doesn 't e ven e xist here . We ha ve to get along . We 're very religious here . I want a child from you . - Actually , I want two or three kids ! - Yes , I can give you some . Three , eight , nine , ten , as many as you like . But , without marriage , oka y ? Come on , don 't joke . It 's the first time I 've asked anyone for that . Attention ! Attention ! Poletti and Caroline are on the right track . I 'm sta ying here . Over and out . I feel like a normal woman with you . The truck has to get through here . Don 't drop it ! There will also be a crane . Let 's go ! Oka y , like that . Good morning , darling . - How long did I sleep ? - Six hours . It 's ele ven o 'clock now . That 's strange . I don 't hear the ocean anymore . I know , the sea has calmed down . Caroline ... do you know what I was thinking ? Why don 't we go awa y , just the two of us ? Far awa y from e veryone , to an island . Yeah , ma ybe you 're right . I 've made a mistake . I want to change . I ha ve to change . I don 't belie ve you , you 're a liar . Yet , I can pro ve to you that I 'm being sincere , that I am telling the truth . The truth , which you like so much . - Did I introduce you to Thomas ? - No . Go , Thomas . Go to Caroline . Don 't be afraid . Show her if I am sincere or not . Thomas is my only friend . Touch his nose . You 'll see how Io ving he is . Look , how good he is . He 's very sweet . Open him . - There is a gun in it . - It 's mine . I ha ve no desire to kill you . I Io ve you . I want to live with you . I feel it , I 've alwa ys felt it ... that you were my hunter . - R eally ? - From the first moment . What 's the matter ? But , that 's fantastic , Caroline . Attention !

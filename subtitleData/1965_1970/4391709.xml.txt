 * By the way , David , I 'm afraid I got a confession to make . I used the university 's computers to finish up these reports . Now , look , I know you warned me , but reprogramming for Scoville 's computers would have delayed us a week . Yeah , well , your getting killed would delay us a lot longer . David , it 's our first offensive action . I 'm getting anxious . Another thing : Remember we 're using code names , will you ? It 's not " Scoville , " it 's " Alex . " I forgot . I 'm sorry , David . Give me a little time . I 'll catch on . Good night , Dr. Kramer . Good night , Walter . I wonder how they 're going to like being on the receiving end of this for a change . All right , turn around , both you ! Up against the wall . Come on . Get the case . ( two gunshots ) I 'll call an ambulance . Get the ... material ... and try ... Dr. Kramer ! There 's been an accident . Call the police . Dr. Kramer 's dead . NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Lin McCarthy ... Donald Davies ... Anna Capri ... Kent Smith ... John Milford . Astronomer Elliot Kramer is dead , but as a legacy to seven people who know our planet is under attack , he has bequeathed a powerful weapon- - a computerized program that will at last enable his seven friends to go from defense to attack . Where 's Elliot ? They killed him . Trouble is , once we start jamming their navigational signals and they lose a few spacecraft , they 'll switch radio bands and without Elliot Kramer , we 'll have a devil of a time isolating the new frequencies . How long had you known him ? 20 good years worth . He was one of the best friends I ever had . I talked him into helping us . Now it seems he died almost for nothing . Maybe not . There might be a way to make his work pay off in something permanent . Some goodies , Lieutenant . Where 'd you find those ? One up on the landing and one down below here . .38 caliber . Did you track down Kramer 's secretary ? Yes . Kramer had an appointment tonight with a man named David Vincent- - an architect . Walter ... Yes , Lieutenant . Did you hear any shooting ? No , sir . But , Lieutenant- - the man who was bending over Professor Kramer- - he went off with the professor 's briefcase . Elliot Kramer gave us the means to go from defense to attack . The means of jamming the navigational signals the aliens are using to get from their planet to ours . But he was more than a scientist . He was a man you were proud to know . Computations completed ? Yes , everything you need to start the transmitters . ( doorbell rings ) Excuse me . Pour a lady a cup ? My pleasure . I 'm sorry to see Edgar take this so hard . Yeah , I wish I could 've stopped it . I know . Come in , Archie . Hi , Edgar . Glad to see you . Thank you . Good to see you . This is Colonel Archie Harmon . Colonel Harmon 's an aide to the Undersecretary of Defense , Air Force . Jim Bryce , my chief engineer . How are you , Mr. Bryce ? Fine , sir . My niece , Joan Surrat . She 's acting as confidential secretary to the group . How do you do ? Miss Surrat . And this is Mr. David Vincent . Colonel . Pleased to meet you , Mr. Vincent . Edgar 's told me a great deal about you . Is the colonel with us , Edgar ? EDGAR : If you mean in our group , I 'm afraid not . Well , then I 'm afraid I don 't understand what ... the colonel 's doing here . Mr. Bryce ... I don 't buy what you people are selling , but when Edgar told me your plans I decided to see for myself . Jamming radio waves is something I understand and Dr. Kramer is someone I respect . I thought you said he was going to be here , Edgar . Dr. Kramer was killed tonight . Killed ? ! I 'll fill you in later . Jim , I suggest you get to work on those transmitters . I want action within 36 hours . Right , Edgar . Good night . Good night . I 'll drive up there with you , Jim . David ... I 'd prefer that you didn 't . Well , we 're finished here , aren 't we ? That 's not the point . You 've been through a good deal . What you need right now more than anything else is a good night 's sleep . What I need right now is to get to work . Ready ? Uh , sorry , David . Uh , car 's loaded with equipment . Besides , it 's , uh ... all pretty technical from here on in . Go home , David . Try to rest . Why the sudden interest in how much rest I get ? You 've been under a strain . Why don 't you recognize it ? I would be , too , under the circumstances . Are you blaming me for Kramer ? All right ... how did they get to him if it wasn 't through you ? I told you he used the university computers . They must have been monitored . I can 't believe he 'd commit such a flagrant breach of security . You 're calling me a liar . Look ... maybe this is none of my business , but ... well , you 've made me a part of your group and I have to say something . Edgar , you 're upset because your friend is dead and you 're feeling guilty . But that 's no reason to be at each other 's throats . Now , both of you ; please . Sorry , David . Joan , can you give me a lift back to my car ? Of course . Edgar ... you two need each other . Drink ? You still keep that 12-year-old sour mash ? ( soft chuckle ) How was Kramer killed ? If I told you aliens , would you believe me ? No . You will . I 'll guarantee that . Mr. Vincent , police department . This your gun , Mr. Vincent ? No . Where 'd you get it ? It 's a long story . You better tell it at headquarters . Look , I 'm tired . What do you want ? Try the truth . I 've been trying that since early this morning . Let me have a whack at it . You were after whatever was in that attaché case . You pulled a gun on Kramer . He fought you for it . It went off twice . You knocked him over the railing made sure he was dead then took off with that attaché case . Well , Mr. Vincent ? Well , that 's , uh ... that 's very good . I hate to screw it up with the facts . Okay , maybe a couple of hours in a cell will make you less squeamish . Filing charges ? We 're holding you for further questioning . You got a right to an attorney , I told you before . All I want is sleep . OFFICER : All right , move along . REPORTER : Did you kill Kramer ? No . Well , how did it happen ? Was it little green men ? Was it , Lieutenant ? Not exactly . What , then ? He said it was aliens . Aliens ? What happened to them ? Come on , Lieutenant . He says they incinerated . Incinerated ? Vincent , what 's your plea ? Innocent by reason of incineration ? Let 's go . Hey , those aliens , what do they look like ? JOAN : David ! Sorry , miss . She 's a friend of mine . Later , miss . DAVID : Get Alex . I don 't have to tell you what the public will think of this . He looks sick , he sounds sick and anyone associated with him would be considered sick , too . But the whole thing 's unfair . David 's trying to protect us . That 's why he can 't tell a coherent story . Do you think Colonel Harmon can get the Department of Defense to trust a man who ... well , who seems to have lost his grip ? You could get David out in ten minutes . Just call the district attorney and tell him you have Kramer 's attaché case . They think David stole it . Sorry , I can 't jeopardize the group just for David . Did you say , " just for David " ? Without David , there wouldn 't be any group . Joan , our duty 's to our work . Edgar , sometimes you frighten me . She in love with him ? The only thing I could do is go back to the apartment and tell ... He must have done something to straighten out this mess . I think you ought to see a lawyer . Any lawyer in the country would think I killed Kramer and start building an insanity plea . Now , what 's with him ? Does he still blame me for Kramer 's death ? David , I don 't agree with him , but , right now , things are crucial . Has he seen what the papers are doing to me ? Does he care ? We 'll do something- - I promise . Want some coffee ? No . Feeling any better ? What do you want ? Thought maybe you 'd feel more like talking now . I told you everything I have to say . Okay , Mr. Vincent , get out of here , but stay where we can find you . What ? Your attorney filed a writ of habeas corpus . Don 't have an attorney . Evidently you do . All right . Thanks for the hospitality . * * * HARMON : When did you move in here ? SCOVILLE : When we decided to jam their navigational bands two months ago . All we were waiting for were Elliot 's final calculations . Mr. Scoville . Colonel . Bryce . Well , you certainly aren 't going second class . That 's one luxury we can 't afford . Used to be an FM radio station . We took it over . Completely revamped it . How 's it coming ? No problem . Elliot knew what he was doing . I wish he were here . LEEDS : Uh , David ? Take this over to the office . I , uh , tried to call you . Wanted to let you know that there 'd be no delay on the plans . David ... I 'm sorry . The board of directors voted that you be replaced . Wait a minute . The police let me go . They didn 't charge me with anything . Mr. Leeds , this project is important to me . I know that , David . I put a year 's sweat into this place . My ideas are new . And you were all so encouraging- - the board , the bank . David , I like your work , but even if you were Michelangelo , I 'd still have to replace you . I 'm sure you understand that . No , I don 't understand . I 'm trying , but I don 't . My work is good . Why don 't I continue ? Now , look . You 're going to receive a pro-rated check in the mail . Change your name . Go away . Forget this , uh ... delusion . How many frequencies are you jamming ? The whole band that Kramer postulated they 'd be using for navigation . And the next time they send down a saucer , they 'll get some action . We 'll see . I hate to see you so unhappy , mister , um ... David . David . I 'm Louise . What 's bothering you , Mr. David ? Have you ever been pro-rated ? Have I ever been what ? Fired . ( laughing ) : Oh , fired . Yes . Sure . Lots of times . Why ? What 's the big deal ? You 've got it made , you know that ? You 're beautiful , you 're happy and you don 't have a brain in your head . Well , now , if you mean that I , I don 't let things get to me ... Well , you 're right , I don 't . ( both laughing ) Well , they will . Mm-hmm . I promise you that- - they 'll get to you . They 'll get to all of us . Promise you that . Mr. David , are you sure you 're all right ? I mean , would you like to talk somewhere else ? 'Cause my apartment 's right down the street . You 're probably just what I need , but I have to go . You 're very nice ... but ... bye-bye . Oh , Mr. David ? Don 't forget your cigarette case . Thank you . Thank you very much . Bye . Bye . Buy you a drink , Mr. Vincent ? Oh , that 's funny . That 's very funny . You cost me a job . Listen , Vincent , in one way or another , you 're responsible for the death of a brilliant man . You 're sick and you 're dangerous and you shouldn 't be walking the streets . Is that your opinion ? Yes , it 's my opinion . You started this , Vincent . They all saw it . Now , you better get out of here before I call the men in the white coats . Paranoid , pure and simple . Let 's get a drink . Hi , David . Hi . You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . That lawyer that got you out- - was he from the group ? No chance . His name was Corbin . I called his office . They said he was out of town . Nearest the court clerk could fig ... What 's the matter ? Nearest the court clerk could figure , a sympathizer must have hired the attorney . What he meant to say was a fellow saucer nut . Well , maybe they got you out . I thought of that , but why would they bother ? To stop the publicity . They don 't have to . I 'm a laughingstock . Oh , David , don 't say that . Hey , have you been in a fight ? The most important punch of my life . It sobered me up . I want you to go away with me . Go where ? Anywhere . We can start over . It 's not my war anymore . It belongs to the money boys and they consider me an embarrassment . David , it 's still everybody 's war . I 've had it . There 's no place to go , no place they won 't find you if they win . That could take years . We could live out our lives . By then , who knows ? Don 't . You believe in this . I believe in you and me . Nothing else matters . It 's everybody 's war . I 've done my hitch , and I deserve a long vacation . Now , how about it ? We 'll have fun , be happy . You shouldn 't be making any decisions right now . Give yourself some time , a chance to think . Please . You coming with me ? There 's no place to hide from them , or yourself . All right . Ciao . All right . Stand by . ( Joan screams ) David ! ( screaming ) ( screams ) David ! David ! You 're not a young man , David . Young in the sense that the future is full of options . A murder charge , loneliness , sickness , death- - that 's your future . What do you want ? Cooperation . I 'm no traitor . But you are at a dead end . We know that . David , do you want to die for them ? For those people who rejected you ? For the society that plans to destroy you ? You 're an outcast . Your only refuge is with us . You 're asking me to ... betray my own kind . To kill them . You won 't have to kill anyone , David . You won 't have to fight anymore . We 'll take care of you- - all of your needs . It could be a good life . Ever read Faust ? It 's about a man who sold his soul to the devil , knowing he 'd end up in hell . Where do you think you are ? What do you think this planet is going to be like for everyone but us and those who work with us ? I am offering you power , David . I don 't want power . I want peace . I want out . Maybe we should talk about money . Money is easy . A million ? Two . In a numbered account in Geneva . And immunity to whatever happens when you win . Agreed . You have something to do . Do you drink ... or do we work ? I guess we work . Well ... that does it . From here on in , we 're fully automated . Good boy . How will you know if you get results ? Well , what we 're hoping is their saucers will crash and when they do , we 'll hear about it . Edgar , if I were listening to anyone else ... ( chuckles ) ( phone ringing ) Yes ? Now take it easy , Joan . We 'll do what we can , I promise . Now , can you get out here ? Fine . I 'm sorry I couldn 't tell you this before , but David and I agreed that his life would depend on the strictest kind of security . David has let himself be taken by the aliens . What ? He 's done his part and if we do ours , we may cripple the invader conspiracy . Surely you know something more about this Alex ? He 's distinguished looking , obviously rich ... after that , I 'm blank . But you worked with him . And he cut me out , didn 't he ? Yes , I keep forgetting that . He was a contact of Kramer 's . People respected Kramer ... influential people . And is Alex responsible for this ? Alex 's money . And the equipment ? From Alex 's factories . You 're a very selective traitor , David . About Alex , you know nothing . About this transmitter ... you 're a fund of information . Well , we 'll see . We 've taken the liberty of inviting a dear friend of yours in . Why ? Simply because I don 't believe you . ( high-pitched electrical buzzing ) ( whirring ) How would I know what it is ? Because you 've probably been there . It 's a radio transmitter . If you say so . Designed for what purpose ? Your group built it . What group ? Who is Alex ? I don 't know . You mentioned his name in the police station . I did ? Oh , yes , you mean Alex Garrotta , the lawyer from Chicago . I thought he might be able to help David . You 're a foolish young woman . We have ways ... Don 't waste your time . They 've all been given a hypnotic cover . It 's a pity about David , isn 't it ? What have you done with him ? The way he cracked up . David 's fine . Are you all right ? Yes . Did you tell them anything ? There was nothing to tell . They know about the transmitter . And they know that Kramer invented a way to jam their navigational signals . That 's right , I told them . Now all they want is a confirmation . You can save your life . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Tell the truth . It doesn 't matter anymore . Alex double-crossed me , didn 't he ? Well , I 'm getting two million dollars . Confirm my story and we 'll both be safe . You 're ill . He 's fantasizing . What have they done to you ? ( phone ringing ) Yes ? I see . Evidently he wasn 't fantasizing , Miss Surrat . We 've just lost one of our ships . Malfunction of the guidance system . Get the equipment ready . We 'll be leaving in 30 minutes . Shouldn 't we wait until tonight ? We 're due in Rockland in three hours . We will leave in 30 minutes . What 're you doing ? We don 't need her now . You kill her , you 'll have to do without me . I thought you were with us now ... You heard me ! You 'll have to kill me , too . She 's coming with us . Why ? She 'll only get in the way . If anything goes wrong , she 'll be killed instantly . Is that clear ? Nothing will go wrong . Don 't worry . David , why ? It 's for the best . Best for whom ? For what ? I mean , wouldn 't it be better to die ? I don 't want to die . Our friends don 't either , but you 're going to kill them . Oh , David , in the name of god , you 're going to kill them . Let 's go . Oh , David , don 't . Please , don 't . Don 't ! Don 't ! Don 't ! Don 't ! 300 cycles . We 're ready . Very good . * * Reality , Miss Surrat- - cold reality . Get the unit . Well ... right there . ( grunting ) Stop it ! Get her on her feet . Keep working ! Don 't do that again . Very impressive . Very impressive , indeed . DAVID : Have you seen this ? We 've underestimated you . Is this more of Kramer 's work ? No , Alex acquired it elsewhere . We 're going to have to talk more about this Alex , David . You let the girl go , perhaps I can get more information . Then you do know who Alex is ? No , but I can find out . ( screams ) David , you planned this , didn 't you- - all of it . I never planned to get you involved . Oh , forgive me . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Ready . Now . ( coughing ) ( coughing continues ) These brain tracings- - how close to human are they ? About a hundred light years away , Colonel . Sorry about what we put you through , David . I 'm not . It was worth it . I want Walter Reade Hospital in Washington immediately and hold the line open for me to Air Force Intelligence , the Pentagon . David ... what 's happening ? Regeneration . They needed regeneration . David ? Is there any way to prevent his going ? Depends upon how much time he has . No time at all . I canceled the trip to the regeneration station in Rockland . I didn 't trust you . I took a chance on you , but I didn 't trust you . This time , you lose . Not quite . Take a look . ( gasps ) Fantastic . Naturally , most of them were skeptical about the film . Film can be faked . They know it and they said it . Does that mean we 're back where we started ? Not at all . I went to my boss . If he had any doubts about the film , he had none about me . He 's setting up a special study commission . I honestly think you 're on your way to enlisting official support . Now , David , if you need any unofficial support with the police ... No , no . Edgar 's taken care of that . Gentlemen , Joan , in the next room , I have some material laid out that just came down from Canada . David ? If I could have stopped you from helping those aliens yesterday , I think I would have killed you . I pitied you and ... I guess I hated you . Now that it 's over , David , I ... I know . Let 's go . They 're waiting for us . NARRATOR : A new war , a war in which the ability to attack is no longer the sole prerogative of the invader .

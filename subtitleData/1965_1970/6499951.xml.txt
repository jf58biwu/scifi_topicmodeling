 ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) Prisoner : Where am I ? Man : In the village . What do you want ? Information . Whose side are you on ? That would be telling . We want information . Information ... Information ... You won 't get it . ( Bubbling ) By hook or by crook , we will . Who are you ? The new number two . Who is number one ? You are number six . I am not a number , I am a free man ! ( Number two laughs ) Training for the big break ? Why not use the village gymnasium ? Uh ... perhaps I prefer privacy . Now , that could be taken as being antisocial . Some setup . Keeping it all to yourself , number six ? Not at all the action of a public-minded citizen . The committee wouldn 't like that . No , the committee certainly wouldn 't . ( Panting ) You 'll face the committee for this . ( Bell chiming ) Man : The council chamber have considered your case , number 93 and already there are signs of disharmony in your behavior . You appear to be a reasonable man but there is plenty of evidence showing your unwillingness to work for the community . Woman crying y the court has a busy morning and there are several cases waiting to be dealt with . Number six is seriously in need of help and we want to do something for 42 . She appears to be in a permanent state of depression always in tears . It is your clear duty , number 93 to prove that you are once again a suitable member of our society . The only way for you now to regain the respect of your fellows is to publicly acknowledge your shortcomings . Go to the rostrum and confess . We will tell you what to say . They 're right , of course . They 're right , of course . Quite right . Quite right ! I 'm inadequate . ( Tea / fully ) : I 'm inadequate . Inadequate . Inadequate ! Disharmonious . Disharmonious . I 'm truly grateful . I 'm truly grateful . Believe me . Believe me . Believe me . Believe me , believe me ... Believe me , believe me ... Believe me , believe me ... Believe me ! ( Applause ) Number six , enter . ( Applause ) I take it you have completed the written questionnaire of confession . Of course . Naturally . Man : Please do not be hostile to the committee . We are here to help you . Do please sit down . Tell us about yourself . I take it you 've checked my file regarding hostility ? Your files are no concern of ours . Any information about you is with number two . Really ? It is the duty of this committee to deal with complaints . Complaints ? Your complaints . Number six : Well done . I have several . You realize a serious charge has been leveled against you particularly regarding your attitude to your fellow citizens ? ( Slam ) We deplore your spirit of disharmony . That 's a ... common complaint around here , isn 't it ? I would counsel discretion , number six . You do appreciate that everything you say is being recorded ? And may be used as evidence against me ? This is a strictly impartial committee . Number six ... You are not called before this committee to defend yourself . All we ask is for your complete confession . ( Bell chiming ) I 'm sure you will cooperate , number six . Gentlemen , it 's time . I think we are all more than ready for a tea break . The group and medical reports will be considered in full at the resumed hearing of th is committee . ( Applause ) ( Number six applauds ) ( Gasps ) Number 93 : They 're right , of course . They 're right ... they 're right ... quite right ! Quite ... right . I 'm inadequate ... inadequate . I 'm inadequate ... disharmonious . And I 'm grateful ... Truly , truly grateful . Truly , truly grateful . Believe me ... believe me ... Believe me ... believe me ... Believe me ... believe me ... Believe me ... believe me ... ( Continues crying ) ( Bicycle bell dings ) Beautiful day , number 61 . I might have guessed . Did you enjoy the show ? There is a saying : " The slowest mule is nearest to the whip . " Yes , and another : " He who digs a pit will one day lie in it . " Or is number two above investigation ? Nobody is above investigation . And failure to cooperate makes one an outcast . No more taxis , no more credit ? Believe me ... It could be only a beginning . You should know . I hope that you do not think that I am a member of th is committee . Oh , no , of course not . Never . I assure you , no matter what significance you may hold for me to the village and its committee you are merely citizen number six who has to be tolerated and , if necessary , shaped to fit . Public enemy number six ? If you insist . But public enemies cannot be tolerated indefinitely . Be careful . Do not defy this committee . If the hearings go against you , I am powerless to help you . Really . Ah , my dear ... Number 86 has had valuable experience with the committee . As a member ? I suffered the shame of being posted . Disharmonious . How terrible for you . The hearings were fair and just . I was at fault . Oh , but this is irrelevant . With your permission , sir , number six has a busy schedule . First the social group , then the medical . Of course . Do carry on . No time for tea ? No . Only your future . First ... Your frivolous attitude towards the committee . Most dangerous . The hearings are televised . That is why your behavior is so important . You stand before the entire community . The social group is your one hope . Fortunately , I , too , have been attached to the group . Most fortunate , yes . Oh , you must try to cooperate . Well , I will . Join in with the group spirit . Only they can help you with the committee . Naturally . Come ... We are already overdue . Females ! If that woman makes one mistake we could lose number six . Did you hear that ? Lose him . There can be no mitigation . We all have a social obligation to stand together . I don 't contest the validity of the complaint . My point is ... No exceptions ! ( Number six claps rhythmically ) All right , you say you 're a poet and you were composing and didn 't hear number ten 's greeting . Neglect of social principle . Poetry has a social value . He 's trying to divide us . His intentions are obvious . To stop us from helping this unfortunate girl . You 're trying to undermine my rehabilitation ! Disrupt my social progress ! Strange talk for a poet . Reactionary ... ! Rebel ... ! Disharmonious ... ! Rebel ... ! Reactionary ... ! Number six : Disharmonious ... Reactionary ... Just in time for your medical , number six . Yes , of course . Hello ... My medical . Splendid , let 's go . First rate , number six . Life here suits you . Are you finished ? Oh , just the patella reflexes . Mm-hmm . Excellent . Fit for any contingency . Anything specific in mind ? My dear chap , how suspicious you are of us all . Be seeing you . Doctor : N ext . ( Electronic humming ) ( Whimpering ) ( Pulling door handle ) Man : Relax , fellow , relax . Are you his keeper ? So excited , all of you . Rushing and shouting . Have you been in there ? Not in there . That 's odd . Not odd , please . Different , maybe . Different ? I 'm one of the lucky ones . The happy ones . I was ... Yes ? I was unmutual . The fellow analysis report submitted by the social group leaves us no choice . We are bound to classify you as unmutual ! We must warn you that if any further complaint is lodged against you it will be necessary to propose you for the treatment know as instant social conversion ! Woman ( On loudspeaker ) : Your attention , please . Here is an important announcement . Number six has been declared unmutual until further notice . Any unsocial incident involving number six should be reported immediately to the appeals subcommittee . Thank you for your attention . Hello ? Hello ? We represent the appeals subcommittee . Quick off the mark . Number 42 ? Appeals subcommittee already ? You certainly get around . Do not sneer at number 42 . To volunteer for social work of this nature requires considerable moral courage . Risk of infection from the untouchables ? Bitterness will not help you , number six . You have brought your misfortunes on yourself . Nevertheless , you ladies I 'm sure , out of the goodness of your hearts will help me . It is clearly premature to look for contrition in the poor creature . ( Chuckling ) Now let 's see how our loner withstands real loneliness . And for his own sake , I hope it will not be for long . Do you hear that ? For his own sake . ( Chuckles ) Waves lapping ) ( Geese honking ) Woman : Your attention , please . Weather : The day will continue warm and sunny but with a danger of sudden storms . A reminder . Coffee , please . Incidents regarding unmutuals should be reported to the appeals subcommittee . Thank you for your attention . Unmutualism , number six . More , you must agree , than just a game . They are socially conscious citizens and are provoked by the loathsome presence of an unmutual . They are sheep . Enough ! He insists on rejecting our offer of help . So be it . There remains but one course open to us . ( Phone beeping ) Yes ? Number two : I warned you . The community will not tolerate you indefinitely . You need a scapegoat . Citizens , unite to denounce this menace in our presence ! A scapegoat ... Is that what you think it is ? Allow me to assure you that after conversion you won 't care what it is . You just won 't care . Ah , yes . The ordeal of social conversion . You 'll soon have lasting peace of mind and adjustment to the social system . Drugs ? Would drugs be lasting ? What would be lasting is isolation of the aggressive frontal lobes ... of the brain . ( Click ) Woman : Your attention , please . Here is an announcement for all staff psychologists and psychiatrists . Those wishing to study the conversion of number six on the hospital 's closed circuit television please report immediately to the hospital common room . Thank you for your attention . ( Crowd muttering ) Splendid , number six . Just in time for the procession . ( Crowd shouting ) ( Electronic humming ) ( Zapping ) We are using standard equipment . Unit containing quartz crystal is activated by a variable electromagnetic field from these high-voltage condensers here . The crystal emits ultrasonic sound waves which are bounced off the parabolic reflector ... Here . The focal point of the reflector can be seen ... here by use of light waves . I will now demonstrate the molecular turbulence at the focal point . ( High-pitched whining ) ( Sizzling ) The ultrasonic beam is capable of penetrating , whereas the light is not . Now ... The prime concern is to locate the link point of the frontal lobes . To do this , we turn to a low-voltage rating and , so to speak feel our focal point into place . Ah ... we have now located the medial aspect of the left motor area . Three centimeters in ... ( Click ) 1.5 centimeters up . ( Clicking ) .45 centimeters right . .023 centimeters down . .0015 up . Hold the horizontal ! Precisely . The ultrasonic beam is now focused on the exact link point of the frontal lobes . Lanolin barrier to minimize external cell breakdown and subsequent scar tissue . Relaxant to preclude muscular reaction . Now to step up the voltage until the ultrasonic bombardment causes permanent dislocation . ( Whining becomes louder ) You went to sleep , number six . Just at the most interesting point , you went to sleep . Ah , yes ... Now , then , just remember , my boy no exertion , no overexcitement . That 's not for you anymore . Number 86 : Don 't worry , doctor . I 'll keep an eye on him myself . ( Dazed ) : What is ... this ? Largely superfluous but I should keep it on if I were you for a couple of days just to remind you to take it easy , hmm ? Now then , some of us have to get on , eh ? Go home at your leisure and , by the way , congratulations , lucky fellow . Wonderful ! Yes . ( Whimpering ) Woman : There he is ! Man : Welcome back ! ( All talk excitedly ) ( Brass band playing ) Number two : Welcome , number six . Welcome home . The lamb returns to the fold , eh ? That 's right , my dear , the kettle to make number six a nice , soothing cup of tea . A celebration drink , eh ? Yes , we can have our little chat later on . I 'll be seeing you both . You 're tired . Lie down . Relax . Hmm ... Cold . Cold ? Rug . Bedroom . Rug ... Rug ? Rug ! Wardrobe . Rest well . Be seeing you . Eh ? Time for our talk , number six . Our talk ? Ah , yes . Now that all your aggressive anxieties have been expunged , let us say forever I know that you will feel free to speak . Free to speak ... Particularly about that little incident which has been causing you such absurd distress . The trivia , the trivia of your resignation . Yes ... you resigned . Why ? Why prematurely ? Why did you resign ? It 's difficult ... Need time to think ... Oh , time , that was it , was it ? No , it wasn 't time . You couldn 't stand your job so you needed more time to think ... No ! No ! I 'm asking you , not telling you ! Please don 't be angry . I 'm not angry , my dear friend . That is just the way things seem to be to you . Yes ... Because your new world is so quiet by contrast . Is it ? For you , agitation is a thing of the past . Is it ? Lay back and rest , lay back and rest ... We can have our little chat later on . ( Chuckles ) When you 've had time to collect your thoughts . Muttering y strange , very strange . What is ? Already he suspects . The scar at any rate is genuine . He 'll learn nothing from that . No , but he suspects already . I gave him eight grains of mytol . Suspicion , doubt ... these are factors of aggression . And the drug should preclude all such reactions . He 's still very confused . Well , he 's shocked as I anticipated . Well , he 's seen what he thought was the operation . He should be convinced . Well , there 's certainly no reason for him to suspect that it never really occurred . Therefore , he must feel that he has undergone the full personality change . How long before his next dose ? At least four hours . Go to him now . Repeat the dose . Now ? But 16 grains of mytol is quite impossible . Look ... Already , aggressions , suspicions . We cannot afford to have a relapse . Yes , but this drug ... Oh , the man 's as strong as a bull . We must simply step up the injection . ( Fingers drumming rapidly ) You still have some impatience . Impulsiveness . Hmm ... Do you like my dress ? More feminine than slacks . There 's one thing , though . I cannot stand girls who don 't know how to make a decent cup of tea . A lesson . Empty pot . Rinse out . Warm the pot , always . Rinse out . Now ... One for me . One for thee . One for the pot . One for luck . Boiling water . Switch off . Let stand for one moment . Oh , uh , pour the milk for me would you , please ? Cup . Saucer . Spoon . Good . Oh , the , um , sugar , please , in the cupboard . Thank you . Pour ... should be just about nice . All charmingly domestic . I think I 'd like some tea . Here you are . Sugar ? Thank you . Excellent , my dear . Just leave him . Just ... leave him to me . ( Chuckles ) ( Humming ) ( Singing melody ) Stupid woman ! Number 86 , report to number two immediately . Do you hear that ? Immediately . Number 86 , report to number two immediately . I have to go ... Repeat , immediately . Stupid woman , she 'll ruin everything ! Be seeing you . Well , why not ? Let him go out . Feel free . He 's safely drugged . If he has doubts , suspicions even a little outside contact will soon reassure him . Lovely day . You , uh , an unmutual ? Yes , but I was , uh saved by social conversion . Do you feel different ? ( Laughs ) You should know . I should ? Who better ? See you soon . See you . Laughing ) ( Footsteps approaching ) Back here again ? Not so full of himself now . Not so much punch in him this time . We have some unfinished business . Yeah ... Remember , number six ? Or perhaps he doesn 't feel up to it . Too much of a social convert . Planning a funeral ? I have to report . On plant life ? To number two . Do you ? I want to make him happy . Really ? I want to make him happy . The ecstasy of illusion . I 'm higher . Really ? I 'm higher than number two . Are you ? I have to report . Go on , then ... report . She could ruin the whole thing . Maybe she 's watching over number six . Physically ? Put out a general call for her . Number six as well ? No , he 's safe enough here for the time being . Just the girl . Calling ... Number 86 . Number 86 , report immediately to number two . I have to report . Of course you do . 86 , report to number two . I have to report . Yes , but first , first there 's something I have to show you . Very important . Number two 's orders . ( Watch ticking ) Now ... See ? Number 86 : Watch . Yes ... watch . See ? See the little green light ? When I look at that ... I always feel sleepy . Makes me want to sleep . Sleep ... I ... am your superior . Here are my instructions . Listen carefully . Here 's what I want you to do . I am going to count from four down to one and then you are going to make a full report on the social conversion of number six . Four ... Three ... Two ... One ! Everything went as planned , sir . We created the illusion of a full ultrasonic dislocation of the frontal lobes of the brain . How was this done ? By using just sound , no ray , no focal point . The patient lost consciousness ? The result of an intradermal injection of mytol I gave him . I see . How was the illusion maintained ? The patient is being kept heavily tranquilized . Well done , 86 . Thank you , sir . Was there anything further ? Yes . Here are your final instructions . Listen carefully . This is what I want you to do . When the village clock strikes 4300 ... He 's safe , I tell you . But if the drug wears off ? The drug is good for several hours yet . If we put out a search for him it might revive his suspicions , ruin everything . ( Phone beeping ) Yes ? Right . Out . My dear man , how kind of you to drop in . Yes , I hoped we might continue that little chat we were having . Ah , why , yes ... Clearer in your mind now ? Oh , much clearer , and , and happier . I want you to know that . Such peace of mind . Of course , only to be expected . And I resisted ... to think I resisted for so long . Extraordinary , isn 't it ? Understandable , a man of your training . But now you , uh ... Oh yes , everything 's clear-cut now . It 's quite simple . Quite so . No more problems , eh ? Now at last we can have our little chat . Yes , I hope so , but ... But ? Well , there 's ... I feel that I ought to tell everyone . Ah ... you need only tell me . Just me . Oh , yes , yes , of course but there must be people who 've got things ... Secrets that you want to know and if I was to speak out publicly , I , I might ... Ah , yes , inspire the others to speak out also . Yes , exactly . What a good idea , number six . Highly commendable . And be assured that I shall record all this in my report . Also , I 'd be able to thank everyone : The committee , the ladies appeal , for their help ... For bringing to me total social conversion . Now what could be more natural ? Number two ( On loudspeaker ) : Your attention , please . Here is an exciting announcement . Following his successful social conversion number six has expressed the touching desire to address you all in person . All of you who are not otherwise occupied should come immediately to the village square . Thank you for your attention . There is a proverb that he who plows a straight furrow needs owe for nothing . Come , and just remember ... No overexcitement , please , hmm ? Fellow citizens ... ( Cheering and applause ) You 're cheering me ... You 're cheering me . That is a mistake . It is number two you should applaud . ( Cheering and applause ) Until he brought about my social conversion ... and believe me , it was him and not your committee ... until then I was a rebel ... An unmutual . Senselessly resisting this , our fine community . ( Cheering and applause ) To borrow one of number two 's sayings : The butcher with the sharpest knife has the warmest heart . ( Crowd murmuring ) Some of you have resisted in the past have withheld knowledge which was important to number two . Now , thanks to social conversion I want to tell you all something and I trust that my example will inspire you all to tell ... To tell ... ( Bell chiming 4 : 00 ) Number 86 : Number two is unmutual ! Unmutual ! Social conversion for number two ! The unmutual ! Number 86 has a confession that number two is unmutual ! Look at him ! An unmutual who desires to deceive you all ! All : Unmutual ! Your welfare committee is a tool of those who wish to possess your minds ! All : Unmutual ! Unmutual ! Unmutual ! Unmutual ! Unmutual ! You still have a choice . You can still salvage your right to be individuals . Your rights to truth and free thought . Reject this false world of number two . Reject it now ! All : Unmutual !

Un-mutual ! Un-mutual ! ( Fading in distance ) : Un-mutual ! Un-mutual ... ! ( Slam echoes )

That is the number of this place . Call from number two . Good morning , good morning . Any complaints ? Yes . I 'd like to mind my own business . So do we . Do you fancy a chat ? The Mountain can come to Mohammed . Number two : Mohammed ? Everest , I presume . I 've never have had a head for heights . Where 's number one ? At the summit . Play it according to hoyle ?

Exactly , that 's what 's worrying me . Very bad for morale . Some of these good people don 't seem to appreciate the value of free elections . They think it 's a game . Everyone votes for a dictator . Not at all . It 's just that their resistance is low . Frankly , my dear fellow you are just the sort of candidate we need . What happens if I run against you ? I might as well , while I 'm waiting . Delightful . What physically happens if I win ? Well , you 're the boss . Number one 's the boss . Join me .

Number two : Exactly . We are , however , fortunate to have with us a recent recruit whose outlook is particularly militant and individualistic ... Crowd : Ra ! Ra ! Let us hope that he will not deny his duty to the community by refusing to take up the challenge . Good people , it is my pleasure to present to you the one and only number six ! Crowd : Ra ! I am not a number . I am a person . In some place , at some time all of you held positions of a secret nature and had knowledge that was invaluable to an enemy . Like me , you are here to have that knowledge protected or extracted . That 's the stuff to give them . Unlike me , many of you have accepted the situation of your imprisonment and will die here like rotten cabbages . Keep going . They love it . The rest of you have gone over to the side of our keepers . Which is which ? How many of each ? Who 's standing beside you now ? I intend to discover who are the prisoners and who the warders .

This 20th-century bastille that pretends to be a pocket democracy ... Why don 't you put us all into solitary confinement till you get what you 're after and have done with it ? Enough ! I call this meeting to order ! Look at them ... brainwashed imbeciles ! Can you laugh ? Can you cry ? Can you think ? ( Banging loudly ) Is this ... Is this what they did to you ? Is this how they tried to break you till they got what they were after ? ( Gavel pounding ) In your heads must still be the remnant of a brain . In your hearts must still be the desire to be a human being again . ( Electronic humming ) This is a most serious breach of etiquette . I had imagined your desire to stand for election was genuine . Personally , I 'm prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe that you were carried away by an excess of enthusiasm . Nevertheless , the rules demand that you should undergo the tests . All those in favor ? Carried unanimously . ( Banging gavel faster and faster ) ( Electronic whooshing and roaring ) Man : They told me you were coming . Do you take sugar ?

Certainly I 'll be more careful but he 's a very stubborn customer . Yes , right away . Certainly I 'll warn them not to damage the tissue . Yes ? Oh , yes , indeed . First stage only . Oh , absolutely . Clearly understood . ( Electronic whine , humming ) This is merely the truth test and there 's no need to be alarmed . Why did you wish to run for electoral office ? Why did you wish to run for electoral office ? ( High-pitched tone ) That is a lie but won 't be held against you . Everything you think here is in the strictest confidence . ( Low-pitched tone ) That 's better . Why did you run for office ? ( High-and low-pitched tones ) Come , come . You thought that if you won and took over our village that you would be able to control an organized breakout . Correct ? ( Lower-pitched tone ) Good . But this was a mistake , wasn 't it ?

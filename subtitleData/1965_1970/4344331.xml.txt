 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . Stay at the door . We might have been followed . Lock your coordinates . What 's the time period ? I can 't tell anything from the way those men are dressed . I 'm trying for a reading . It 's holding steady . 1 861 . Ann ? Our readings match . I think I can get a more precise measurement . - Yes . There it is . February , 1 861 . - Check . The coordinates are shifting . I can 't get them to lock . - Let me try , Ann . - [ Switches Clicking ] [ Chattering , Laughing ] Doug and Tony must be somewhere in that theater . - We just saw them in a barn . - [ Ann ] Why is that soldier on guard ? [ Audience Laughing ] [ Gunshot ] Lincoln . The Ford Theatre . The assassination . I don 't understand it . Lincoln was assassinated in 1 865 . The time reading is definitely 1 861 . You the man Abner sent from Frederickville ? Uh , yes , he sent both of us . Good . I 'm Matthew Gebhardt . Of course you know my brother , Jeremiah , who was with John Brown at Harper 's Ferry . We will kill Abraham Lincoln . Is it possible that Lincoln was killed in 1 861 ? That would mean someone impersonated him for the next four years . Lincoln is coming through Baltimore on his way to his inauguration . We will have the opportunity to kill him within the next 1 2 hours . Wait a minute . Seems to me I remember reading ... about an earlier assassination attempt against Lincoln . I 'll program the history computer . What do you make of it , Ray ? How could we have ... picked up that earlier time zone without Tony and Doug being there ? I don 't - I don 't know . The obvious connection is through the two separate attempts on Lincoln 's life . But it 's almost as though the Tunnel is making its own projection ... independent of the probe on Doug and Tony . By killing Lincoln here in Baltimore ... the Southern secessionists will be blamed ... and in revenge , the Northern states will invade the South ... and the cancer of slavery will at last be rooted out . [ Man ] You in there . ! Come out with your hands above your heads . ! - [ Gunfire ] - [ Return Gunfire ] [ Gunfire Continues ] Quick ! We got a way out ! Come on ! Follow me ! [ Gunfire ] [ Grunts ] [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . No , Carver . I wanna question him . Scott , get after the others ! Carver , get a message to the train dispatcher . Order him to stop the president 's train at the depot here in Baltimore . - I 'll meet him there . - Yes , Mr. Pinkerton . Get on your feet , you . Get movin ' . What happened ? - Where are we ? - We brought you here . This is our house . Where 's Doug , the man who was with me ? Here . This 'll clear your head . - My friend . What happened to him ? - He was captured . - We saw him led away . - [ Whistle Blows , Distant ] Just the morning train . We don 't live too far from the tracks . - Can we get to Doug ? - I don 't know . There must be some way . Who were those raiders ? Some government men . We can 't tell where they took him though . Look , he 's not important . Matthew , go look in on David . Yes . That raid happened so fast . I can 't even remember what day it is . That must 've been some clout you took on the head . It 's the 22nd of February . The year of Lincoln 's inauguration . 1 860 , ' 61 . - Still asleep . - We 'll have to keep our voices down . Our little brother . He 's only 1 1 . All right . Now , the three of us . my plan to kill Lincoln - - The three of us can still carry it out . - No , you can 't . Those government men are onto your plans . They might know I 'm after Lincoln , but they don 't know how I intend to get him . - Just keep quiet and listen . - Jeremiah , it 's impossible ! I said keep quiet . Nothing 's impossible . John Brown and just a handful of us took over an entire arsenal ... and if a traitor hadn 't exposed us , we 'd have gone on to rally the nation to our cause . That 's right . I made this . It 's a timing dial . All I have to do is set it for as long as I want . - A time bomb ? - Yes . When this mark here reaches this one at the top ... a firing pin strikes a spark . That sets off a charge strong enough to shatter a boulder . Hmm.Jeremiah worked at the arsenal eight years . There 's nothing I don 't know about explosives . Now , listen . Lincoln 's train is coming into Baltimore tonight from Philadelphia . While the train is being switched through the city to the Washington line ... I 'll hide on board and set the timer . It won 't work . [ Panting ] The train is sure to be heavily guarded . You 'll never make it ! What 's the matter with you , boy ? That knock on your head shake your determination ? Listen . I 've got a right to say what I think . - Your whole plan is wrong ! - Shh . At the first sight of blood , you wanna run . Every man came to that meeting prepared to give his life . Now , you decide . Are you with us or against us ? - There 's no in-between . - Jeremiah , that 's enough . I want his answer ! What I meant was ... that just three of us can 't do it ! Three is plenty . You and Matt cause a diversion while I get on the train . [ David ] Hey , what 's for breakfast ? - I 'm hungry . - We 'll fix you something . - You go get dressed . - I 'll bring my clothes in here . In your room , David . Stay there till I call you . - What did I do ? - Do as I say ! - What 's that ? - David . Uh , that 's , uh - that 's kind of a clock . Now , go on . It 's a funny-looking clock . - We 'll all feel better after we eat something . - It 's gonna be the way I say ... even if we all get killed , you understand ? There definitely was an assassination attempt in 1 861 . Here 's an editorial from the New York Tribune , February 25 , 1 861 . It tells about the assassination plot , but it doesn 't name anyone . This is strange . Two items naming different groups of conspirators . Oh , I think I 've got something that explains that . This is Allan Pinkerton 's record book . Let 's see . It says-Yeah . " " Several conspirators used code names . " The whole thing seems to be controversial . Now , here 's an item ... that says Pinkerton was hardly involved at all . Look at this . From Leslie 's Weekly : " " Lincoln 's political enemies certainly had a field day ... trying to make him look ridiculous and cowardly . " Here 's something written by one of Lincoln 's closest associates , Ward Hill Lamon . Says , " " On advice of Mr.Judd , the president agreed to Mr. Pinkerton 's plan ... " " to travel without his family and associates . Pinkerton 's intention was to spirit the president through Baltimore undetected . " All right now . From the beginning . Pinkerton , I 've told you everything I know . I was in the barn , and I overheard the conspirators . You were one of them . Admit it ! - I was sleeping in the barn . - Sleeping in a barn ! - A man with your fine clothes ? - I had no money . You know that . You searched me . You carried no identification , so if you were caught , you could lie without trapping yourself . Listen , Phillips , or whatever your real name is . You can be hanged without a confession . - Then why are you trying to shake it out of me ? - I want all the others . Give me their names , addresses , where their arms are stored , everything ... and I 'll do my best to save you from the gallows . All I know is that their ringleader 's name is Jeremiah , and that 's all I know . - Where does this Jeremiah live ? - [ Sighs ] - You admit he intends to kill the president ? - Yes . [ Breathing Heavily ] Either you 're a fool , or you think I am . If I were in your place , I 'd be admitting it was all a mistake ... that all I broke up was a card game . You confess to the plot and say you were an innocent bystander ? Have you ever considered that I could be telling the truth ? No , but I 'll get the truth out of you . - Scott ? - Yes , sir ? - [ Train Whistle Blows , Distant ] - Wait . That must be the president 's train . - [ Whistle Continues Blowing ] - What 's wrong , Jeremiah ? A train 's comin ' . No train 's due here for a couple of hours . I 'm going over to the tracks and take a look . I don 't want no one to leave here till I get back . You see to that , Matthew . - You want some more coffee ? - Yes . I 'll get it for you . - [ Yelps ] - [ Chuckles ] - Guess that 'll teach ya . - I reckon it will . [ Train Whistle Blows ] - Thank you , David . - Yeah . Jeremiah 's all wrong about Lincoln . - We don 't talk politics in this house . - Sure you do . - Leastwise , I always hearJeremiah . - Don 't brag about big ears . Your brother doesn 't understand what Lincoln 's been saying . - That 's enough . - Matthew ... you and Jeremiah will never succeed in what you 're trying to do . David , you go on out and chop some kindling in back . - I filled the wood box yesterday . - Never mind . Do what I tell ya ! You don 't have to hear everything that goes on here . Now , go on . Get ! Ohh . [ Sighs ] Sometimes you have to kill , even if you don 't want to . We 're like soldiers , and we 're fighting a just cause . But what about David ? How long do you think you could keep him from finding out what you 're up to ? He don 't know anything , and he won 't ... if you keep your mouth shut . You 're fooling yourself , Matthew . You 're refusing to callJeremiah 's scheme what it is . It 's murder ... and David 's gonna find out sooner or later . - Jeremiah says killing Lincoln is right . - Matthew , that won 't work . Just becauseJeremiah 's giving the orders doesn 't make you any less responsible . If you help him try to kill Lincoln ... you 'll fail - I 'll tell you that - but you 're gonna feel like a murderer for the rest of your life . - I don 't wanna hear no more . - [ Train Whistle Blowing ] Now , you just stay put . What 's the meaning of this additional delay ? Another rumor ? - Not at all , sir . - Against my better judgment , I let my friends persuade me ... to agree to this ridiculous plan of yours to smuggle me through Baltimore . - Sir , if you 'll let me tell you - - By all means , tell me ... but I 'm tired of rumor and hearsay . There were conspirators , sir . I followed a lead given me by an informant . My men and I raided their meeting . They put up resistance . Four of 'em were killed , and I took one prisoner , but some of 'em escaped . Then rumor has for once turned to fact . Till I 'm certain the way across Baltimore is safe , this train must remain here , sir . - Aren 't we in Baltimore ? - Yes , sir . The north section of the city . This depot and most of the buildings in this area were abandoned ... to make way for a new road . - How long will we be forced to wait here ? - I can 't tell , sir . If you 'd like to warm up , we have a stove going inside the depot . [ Grunts ] Just a minute , Mr. Lincoln . - Scott ? - Yes , sir ? Bring that man out here . - Take him back into town and lock him up . - Yes , sir . Let 's go . - Mr. President - - Come here ! Believe me , sir . I had no part in any plot against you . Believe me , sir . I had no part in any plot against you . I 've yet to hear a felon insist that he 's guilty . But don 't take him away yet . I want to talk to him . - All right , sir . Take him back inside . - Yes , sir . Will you sit down ? You 're making me nervous . - We got him , Matt . We got him ! - What are you talkin ' about ? - Got who ? - Lincoln ! He 's at the old depot . - But he wasn 't due in the city till tonight . - Well , he 's here now . I figure they intend to keep him there until they think it 's safe to take him through town . They 've played right into our hands . It 's fate , Matthew . Fate . They 've got your friend at the depot . All right , boys . Now , the plan is the same . Except , instead of blowing up the train , we just simply blow up the depot . You can 't . You 'll kill Doug and everyone else who 's there . What 's wrong with that ? We 'll get Lincoln ; that 's all that 's important . Your friend will die for the cause . Your liver 's turned yellow , so I 'm gonna kill you now ... and save any further trouble . - No , Jeremiah . You can 't kill him . - You gone yellow too ? - I won 't stand for murder . - You quitting 'me , Matt ? I 'm with you on Lincoln . That 's different . - You convinced me of that . Killin ' him is right . - No , it isn 't , Matt . Shut up . Shut up . Shut up ! Or I 'll kill you no matter what he says . Anyone with Lincoln might get killed . You gonna balk at that too ? If they 're with Lincoln , I reckon we don 't have a choice . Then what 's the difference with this man ? He 's a traitor to the cause . - I say we kill him . - No ! All he 's done is disagree with you , Jeremiah ! I tell you , if you kill him , I 'm not with you anymore . - You gonna stop me , Matt ? - I intend to try , yeah . [ Sighs ] All right . Tie him up . Let the devil take him after we get Lincoln . Come on . In the chair . You 'll fail . You won 't kill Lincoln . But a lot of other innocent people could be killed . What 's the matter ? How come you 're tying him up ? Go on . Tell him , Jeremiah . Tell the boy what you 're plannin ' to do . - I 'm warning you . - Aren 't you proud of yourself ? Won 't David be proud of his brothers ? You pay him no heed , David . He 's a bad one who 'd do Matt and me harm if he could . I don 't understand . Someday you will . Now , get into that bedroom and stay put untilJeremiah and I get back . We got business at the depot . [ Lincoln ] One man , this Jeremiah , determined to plunge the nation into war ? I can 't believe anyone could be that mad . Nor can I believe that men of reason could be driven to war ... because of the president 's death . Yet in times like these , such a mad scheme could succeed . But why me , sir ? Why should men who want slavery abolished wish to assassinate me ? I 'm opposed to slavery - believe that eventually , it shall cease to exist . Jeremiah 's a follower ofJohn Brown 's , sir . He wants immediate results . John Brown was hanged , and so shall anyone else be ... who tries to start a revolt . Slavery is an evil that men of reason will abolish by reason . I wish I could believe that , sir ... but four states have already seceded from the Union , and others are certain to follow . Nothing is certain . Once I take office ... I shall do everything possible to bring those states back into the Union . I know that , Mr. President , but I 'm afraid war is inevitable . You believe that ? Yet you 've declared Jeremiah wants to assassinate me to cause the war . Apparently you feel he will still succeed . He will not succeed , and I 've told you the truth , Mr. President . - I have no part in his conspiracy . - Grim flattery . You think my death could alter the course of history ? There will be no war between sister states . What if the seceding states refuse to rejoin the Union ? You 've a way of speaking that suggests you have an insight into the future . - I do , sir . - Indeed . I 've met other men who 've claimed the gift . Of course , their predictions can hardly ever be proved . But tell me your version of the future . Well , sir , you 'll - Not about me . The nation . Will the Union be standing a decade from now ? Yes . Even a century after the decade ... this nation will still be thriving . Neither of us will live long enough to test your prophecy ... but it pleases me nevertheless . [ Gunfire ] Keep that man covered , Scott . If he tries to run , shoot to kill . Remain here , sir . [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] Halt ! Stand where ya are ! - What 's this ? - Did you fire those shots ? Well , I reckon I did . I can 't kill rabbits by spitting ' on ' em . - Rabbits ? - Why , sure . Yeah ? This section of town 's home to half the rabbits in the county . Rabbits . [ Ticking ] He 'll kill everyone . We 've got to transfer Doug ! - Ray , can you do it ? - I haven 't got a clear fix on him . Try for it . I don 't want Doug placed in a time zone different from Tony 's . Ann , see if you can get an image ofTony . - Well , Mr. Pinkerton ? - I found the man who fired those shots , sir . - Just a hunter after rabbits . - Mr. Pinkerton ... perhaps you 've heard I 'm a patient man . - Yes , Mr. Lincoln , I have . - It 's a myth . I 'm tired of this delay . I must get to Washington . Sir , we 've got to take every precaution . If I leave it to you , Mr. Pinkerton , I 'll spend my entire term in this building . Till I 'm certain the danger 's over , sir , you must stay here . Not here . I 'm going out to my railroad car . Do what you must , but do it quickly . I 've an inaugural speech to give , and it 's not yet written . I 'll walk with you , sir , and post a man outside your compartment . - You can keep that man here for the time being . - Yes , sir . [ Ticking ] [ Panting ] I was worried that they got ya . Come here , Matthew . I placed the bomb . Lincoln will die . - Let 's go . - No , no , no . If we cross this way , they can see us from the depot . Let 's circle around to get back to the house . Once that bomb goes off , they 'll be sending troops out to search the whole area . Matthew , we 'll take David into the city for a few days and stay hidden . Come on . Let 's go . I want the route across the city fine-combed . Buildings , rooftops , cellars . Scott , arrest every suspicious character . By the time they 're released , the president will be safe in Washington . Right . Carver , get to the train and tell the engineer to be ready to leave at any time . Right , sir . [ Tony ] Stop that train . ! There 's a bomb . ! Stop that train . ! - Hold it . - Get everyone out of the area . A bomb 's been planted . - What 's all the shouting about ? Who are you ? - There 's a bomb around here . - Nonsense . Take him inside . - Wait a minute ! Come on . - Tony . - Doug . - Sit down . - Jeremiah 's planted a bomb . - Where ? Here ? - He knows Lincoln 's here . - So , you two know each other . - Get everyone away . That bomb could go off at any time . What 's this nonsense about a bomb ? No one got near enough to place it . Listen to him , Pinkerton . That rabbit hunter could 've been a ruse . - This platform was left unguarded for a few minutes . - Put the cuffs on him , Carver . [ Cuffs Jangling ] Put your hands up . - [ Gunshot ] - [ Grunting ] [ Ticking ] - Hold it ! - Get back ! - I found the bomb . I threw it over there . - Keep your mouth shut and move . Inside ! You have enough power to transfer just the bomb ? I 'll have sufficient energy in 280 seconds . Bring the bomb into the Tunnel . It 's a primitive device . All we have to do is jam its dial ... to keep it from exploding . This should prove I 'm telling the truth . All it proves is that you burnt your wrists somehow . If you want the conspirators , I can lead you to their house . Sure . You 'd like me to take all my men and leave the president unprotected . - Your orders were to stay on the train with the president . ! - I insisted , Mr. Pinkerton . - What was that shot I heard ? - [ Pinkerton ] Another one of the conspirators . - He 's attempted a diversion - something about a bomb . - There is a bomb . - I can show them where it is . - Is there a bomb , Mr. Pinkerton ? - No , sir . - There 's a simple way to prove it . - Let him show it to you . - Why hasn 't it gone off ? - It 's a time bomb . - Well , Mr. Pinkerton ? - Sir , I - - Shall we go look for the bomb together , Mr. Pinkerton ? No , sir . My job is to protect you , sir . - From imaginary bombs ? - There may be one , sir . Why , that 's almost an admission that this man could be telling the truth . - All right , sir . I 'll investigate . - [ Tony ] Wait . Let me show you where it is . It might go off before you find it . Matt , where are you ? [ Ticking ] Matt ? Jeremiah ? Where are you ? [ Charges Firing ] - [ Kirk ] Don 't be afraid of me , son . - [ Ticking Continues ] No , General . The radiation . - The boy 's in there . - He 's shielded . - You can 't cut off the power ? - On this retrieve , not for another five minutes . - Son , can you hear me ? - Yes , sir . - You can step out here . No one will hurt you . - Where am I ? - I 'll explain that when you come out . - No . I wanna go home . - David , you must come to me ! - How 'd you know my name ? We know your brothers too : Jeremiah and Matthew . Please trust us , David . Son , do you know what that thing is you 're holding ? It 's a kind of clock . I 'd like to see it , David . Would you show it to me ? No . It 's Jeremiah 's . He wouldn 't want nobody looking at it . No , no , no . Darling , you don 't understand . We want you to bring it here . - It 's hopeless . We 've got to send him and the bomb back . - We can 't . The bomb will destroy him , us and the Tunnel . I 'm sorry . - David , please listen to us . - Prepare to transfer him . Wait ! Wait ! David ... that is not a clock . - It 's a bomb . - You 're lyin ' t - It 's Jeremiah 's clock . Bring it out here quickly , David ! When that dial gets to zero , the bomb will explode . David , please . Bring it out while there 's still time for us to stop it . Please ! I wanna go home . I don 't like this place . [ Charges Firing ] David , leave the bomb in the Tunnel and come out . It can 't be a bomb . It 's Jeremiah 's clock . Are you going to wait until it explodes ? Do as I say ! We 've got to get him to jam that dial . David , the dial . Can you turn it back ? That will keep it from exploding . - It won 't budge . - Then bring it here . - We can 't hold him much longer . - Send him back ! David , can you jam the dial ? Do you have anything - anything in your pockets ? - Will this work ? - Try it . Wedge it in between the dial and the case . - It won 't stop . - Son , try one of these tools . - [ Ticking Stops ] - [ Gasps ] [ Charges Firing ] He 's gone . If he got to the depot , he might 've taken Lincoln out of danger . What about David ? Maybe he took David with him . That bomb should 've gone off by now . He stopped it . He stopped the bomb . - Why didn 't you let me kill him ? - [ Running Footsteps ] Matt , Jeremiah . Sit down . - Where have you been ? - I went down to the depot to find you . I saw the man who escaped . I ran to tell you , and then I found your clock . - The clock ? You found the clock ? What did you do with it ? - Leave him be , Jeremiah . - They said it was a bomb . - No such thing , David . One of the men said it would explode , but I stopped it with a funny-looking tool . - What man ? What man are you talking about ? - One of the men in the cave . - There 's no cave around here . - Leave the boy alone . I found the clock . Then all of a sudden ... it was like I was in a big thunderstorm , and then the next thing ... I was standing in some sort of cave and everybody wanted me to come out . - What kind of lying gibberish is this ? - I ain 't lying ' . - What did you do with the clock , David ? - I told ya . I stopped it . Then I was in another storm and right back near the depot . That 's the truth . Where is the clock , David ? Just tell me where it is . I left it , down near the horse trough . - All right . You 're gonna take me - - No . They said it was a bomb . - It might explode . - You wanna get caught , and David with ya ? - Let 's get away . - I gotta get that . No . No . We failed . - Maybe it 's a good thing . - You give up mighty easily , Matt . I 'm gonna get on that train , and I 'm gonna plant that bomb . I don 't need your help . - I can kill Lincoln by myself . - You wanna kill Lincoln ? No . He doesn 't mean it , David . No . He 's old enough to know . Someday you 'll understand . Someday the whole nation 'll be proud of your brother . That 's all it is to you , isn 't it , Jeremiah ? Honor ! People cheering ' ya ! Your wanting ' to kill Lincoln has nothin ' to do with our cause ... nothin ' to do with what we believe ! [ Grunts ] Right here . It 's gone . I 'm sure this is where it landed . All right . I called your bluff . There is no bomb . Pinkerton , isn 't it just possible thatJeremiah came back and found it ? That 's right . He may try again . Either you 're the most persistent liars - Scott , get back to the president and keep guard with the others . If anyone gets near the depot , shoot to kill . All right now . We 'll see it through . Take me to that house where you were held prisoner . It 's down here . Matt , wake up . Wake up , please . Matt , wake up , please . - Do you still doubt what I told you ? - It 's my job to doubt . Abolitionist incitements . Quotations from John Brown urging open revolt . An editorial calling the president a toady of the Southern cause . Mr. Pinkerton , if we were part of the plot against Lincoln ... why would I bring you here ? - You still haven 't proven there was a bomb . - Under the sink , the cabinet . There 's a box . What 's this ? All the things a man would use to put a bomb together . - Well , there 's your proof . - We 'd better find that bomb before it goes off . Jeremiah might still be trying to get to him . If he knows the president 's at the depot - I 'd better get back , and quick . What about us ? You two can go on about your own business . - Get away . Matt ain 't done nothin ' to you . - Now , hush , David . Jeremiah [ Sighs ] Gotta find him . - David , try to find a doctor . No . No . I 'll be all right , on my feet . Help me up . [ Panting ] Please.Jeremiah 's still after Lincoln . We gotta-We gotta find him . - We gotta stop him . - He won 't be able to get to Lincoln . You gotta help me saveJeremiah , keep him from murder . - He 'll be stopped . They 're on the watch for him now . - No . That 's not what I want . I gotta stop him . I wanna stop him . Now , you 've gotta help . I know - I saved your life . You owe it to me . You owe it to him ! All right . All right , Matt . We 'll help you . - Where is he ? Do you know ? - Well , I , uh - He 's headed back to the depot . Now , you get on back to the house and you stay there , understand ? - Yes , Matthew . - Now , go on . Get . - We 'll soon be on our way , sir . - Mr. Pinkerton , I - I 'm sure rumors of the conspiracy plot ... will find their way into the newspapers . It can be reported as more than rumor , sir . I can name the ringleader . - It 's not here . - Jeremiah must 've gotten it . He must be somewhere near the train . You and Matthew check the streets . I 'll check the depot . Come on . - Jeremiah , don 't - don 't try . - Get out of here . I 'm asking you for yourself , for David . Let the president be . It just wasn 't meant to be . No ! All right ! Get back ! Don 't take another step , neither one of you . I came here to kill Lincoln , and if I have to get you too , I 'll do it . Well , then , you 're gonna have to kill me too . Don 't make me kill you , Matt . Kill me . Go on , Jeremiah ! Kill me ! [ Cries Softly ] I can 't . I can 't , Matt . [ Sighs ] Maybe killing ' Lincoln 's not the way . [ Bell Dinging ] Come on , Jeremiah . Let 's go home . David 's waiting . Tony - look at that tool . That could only have come from the Time Tunnel . [ Gunfire ] [ Yelps ] Doug , look out ! [ Gunfire Continues ] Come . ! This way . ! This way . ! - Come on . - [ Soldier ] Hurry up . ! Open the gate ! [ Horses Neighing ]

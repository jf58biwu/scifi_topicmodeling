 [ theme music plays ] Well , I suppose you 're all wondering what this is about . Well , you 're going to have a new little friend . Mr. Pringle . Listen to this . " Dear Mr. Wilkes , you will no doubt be pleased to receive the colestria quintanlia . I recommend our usual diet of diced rabbit and suggest a little vitamin C , with her water . She is apt to be shy and reticent at first but plant her in shallow earth near amicable associates , give her a little care and attention and you will find her a most devoted and amusing companion . Sincerely , Pringle . " Now , what shall we call her , eh ? Josie , yes , that 's nice . All right . I 'm going to put Josie here between George and Frances . Now , she 's bound to feel a bit out of place , coming into a new garden , for a day or two . so have a little chat with her now and again and make her feel at home . We 're going to have a " be nice to Josie " week . Yeah , and that means you as well , Teddy . [ laughs ] Go on . None of your old shenanigans now . Ooh . Well , I 'd better get off to the shop . Got to get the rent from somewhere . See you all tonight . Ouch ! [ laughing ] Get down off the wall ! Go on ! Clear off ! Go on ! [ groans ] [ child giggles ] Hello , dear , you 're up early . Where 've you been ? Out gardening already ? Got to keep it tidy , Monica , otherwise it 'll go to pot . Tidy ? It 's like a jungle out there . I like the garden to have a bit of freedom . I hate living things being made to measure . ln patterns , you know ? You 're going to be late . No , that 's all right . Miss Lovejoy 's going to open up the shop . Oh , look , now she 's getting the hang of things , does that mean we can have our holiday after all ? Oh well , I don 't know if she 's ready to take over completely . The summer will be over shortly , then it 'll be too late . Still , you don 't care about that , do you ? You don 't want to go on holiday . You 're frightened somebody will run off with your garden . It 's nothing to do with the garden , Monica . It 's you . It 's your nerves . Now , look , what good is it going to do you ? Going out to some old boarding house , when you 're not well . Well , let 's do something about getting you better first . Well , I am . Dr. Hunt just keeps giving me those pills , and none of them do any good so I 've asked another doctor to come and see me . Well , good , maybe we 'll get some results . His name 's Chambers . I 'll be a private patient , so that means we 'll have to pay . Well , I don 't care about that . So long as he makes you better , that 's all that matters . Oh , thank you , Henry . You don 't have to thank me . I want you to get better . What time is he coming at this doctor ? He said tonight . He wants to be here when you 're here , see . Oh , good . Well , listen , I 'll have a chat with him . I 'll get him to give you a proper tonic to perk you up . Then when you 're well again , we 'll go off on a nice , long holiday . Two whole weeks . Just you and me down at the seaside . Oh , that 'll be lovely , Henry . Do you know ? I sit here thinking you don 't care , when all the time you 're the best husband in the world . And why shouldn 't I be ? I 've got the best wife , haven 't I ? Oh , go on , save your blarney for the customers . All right , all right . Oh , now listen , you won 't be late home will you , dear ? Because of that Doctor ? Monica , I 'll be as early as I can . - All right . - Bye , love . Bye . [ engine starts up ] [ engine revs ] - Ah , good morning , Anne . - Morning , Mr. Wilkes . Well , you 've made a good start , you must have got here early . Did the- - ? - What 's that ? - What 's what ? - This . - Parsley , Mr. Wilkes , ... - I thought you 'd- - - Yes , I know it 's parsley . - Where did it come from ? - The greengrocers . I thought it 'd make the fish look nice . No , no , we mustn 't . Well , other fishmongers use it all the time . Yes , well . I don 't , Miss Lovejoy . Never . Never . Man , animals , even fish , are all preying like monsters on the vegetable world . We 've got to do everything we can to stop it . - But I thought that- - - But , look at it . Look at the delicate formation . See how curly and crinkly and soft it is . Hours ago that was a thing of living beauty . Now it 's all brown and dead and decaying . I 'm sorry , Mr. Wilkes . That 's all right , Anne , you weren 't to know . What happens if people want parsley sauce with their fish , Mr. Wilkes ? Well , they won 't buy it from me . I mean , to use such a marvellous creation as this to decorate a lot of old fish , well , it 's sacrilege , isn 't it ? I suppose they 'll get it if they want it , but I try to discourage them by not selling it in the shop . I knew you was a man of culture the first day I started to work here but I never realised you 're as sensitive as you are , though . I 'm sorry I about the parsley , Mr. Wilkes . Oh , well , that 's all right . We 'll forget all about that . Did they send everything from the market that I ordered ? Well , the whiting looked a bit grey , so I sent it back . Quite right , too . That 's a gutty fish . It goes off as quickly as anything in this weather . What about the rabbits , haven 't they come , yet ? Oh , no , not yet . Oh , well , listen , if they don 't come shortly , get on the phone and give them a rocket . All right . Hey , what about a nice cup of coffee . Or have you had one yet ? No , there hasn 't been time . Oh , well , let 's have one now while things are nice and quiet . Oh , it looks like I spoke too soon . It 's all right . I 'll serve her Oh , morning Mrs. Bryant , It 's a nice morning . Yeah , lovely , ain 't it ? How are those violets your husband planted ? Eh ? Oh , they 're all right . I had a butchers at ' em before I come out , they looked all right to me . Here , he 's got the dead needle to you , though . - Who has ? - Me old man . He has ? Why ? Well , you told him you was growing some flowers in your garden . Lollapaloozers or something ? - Laurientalas . - Yes , that 's ' em . Well , he says you 're off your rocker . He says he wrote to a geezer at Kew Gardens asking about them and they wrote back and said it was impossible to grow lolloploozers in this country without a greenhouse . You ain 't got no greenhouse . Yes , well , I must 've made a mistake about the name . Well , look , tell Fred that I 'll get in touch with Mr. Pringle . and get that all sorted out . I shouldn 't trouble . Fred said he 's fed up with you and your Mr. Pringle telling him all them fairy stories . Anyway , he wants some soft roes for his tea . Have you got any ? Roes ? Oh , yes they 're very nice this morning . Now , how many do you want , half a pound , three quarters ? Half will do . [ Henry ] That 'll be two shillings please . Ah , there you are . Thank you . Mrs. Bryant . Thank you . Good morning . [ Mrs. Bryant ] Morning . [ door closes ] Ahh , that 's the stuff to give the troops , Anne . Thank you . Would you like a sandwich with it ? Oh , please . Take a couple , they 're only small . Yes , I had no time for breakfast this morning . What 's in them then ? Oh . What 's the matter ? What is it ? A lovely little tomato all cut to pieces . And the leaves of a lettuce in shreds . It 's like making a stew of your pet Siamese cat and having it for lunch . I 'm sorry , Mr. Wilkes . Shall I take out the lettuce and tomato and just leave the cheese ? No , no , look , I couldn 't . It 's tainted , isn 't it ? I suppose it is really . Look , I 'm sorry , Mr. Wilkes . I 'll try and remember in future . Look , I 've just got to pop out for a minute . If those rabbits don 't arrive , just give them a ring and remind them , will you ? Yes , I 'll tell them it 's urgent . That 's three shillings , please . Thank you . [ buzzing , ringing ] Henry , what are you after ? I 've got a nice brand of weed killer , just come in . You know very well there are no weeds in my garden . No , just something I thought you might find interesting . Mr. Pringle wrote and- - Pringle ? The master mind ? You know , Henry ? Sometimes , I think you invented this Mr. Pringle just to substantiate some of your more outrageous statements . This concerns cucumbers . Do you know , there 's a fella . He 's managed to breed cucumbers that are all male , or all female . Non-hermaphrodite ! I can 't see it will matter very much , Henry . I imagine they 'll taste just the same ? But don 't you see ? Melons belong to the same family as cucumbers . It could have endless possibilities . I 'm more interested in what 's going to win the first race at Epsom . Hey , you 're always on about how clever your Mr. Pringle is . Why don 't you write and ask him what he knows about the horses ? He 's got more serious things to think about than racing . Beer and gambling , that 's all people seem to care about these days . Did you read your newspaper last night ? - Yeah , I glanced through it . - Yeah , the racing columns . I don 't suppose you read Professor Englehart 's little piece ? Who 's he ? Englehart ? Just about the greatest authority on botanical science in the world . I knew I shouldn 't have asked , Henry . Yes , well , anyway , look . He 's trying to solve the world 's hunger problem . Now , I don 't agree that we should eat things that are grown from the soil , but one fascinating little detail cropped up , and that was ... If you inject plants with a solution of potash and hextolenium , you can make them grow to twice their normal size . But you tried to do something like that with your rhubarb , Henry , didn 't you ? You told me you got it growing like tree trunks . Yes , well , that 's it ! That 's what I mean . It 's quite possible that me and Professor Englehart are working along the same lines . Yeah , but he 's talking sense , isn 't he ? I mean , he wants to grow things large to feed people . What do you want to do it for ? I mean , when you had your rhubarb growing up over the wall , you wouldn 't give me a bit to take home for a pie now , would you , Henry ? Look , Norman , listen . If I cut your hand with a knife it hurts you , doesn 't it ? Yes . And if we stick a knife in a pig it hurts him , as well . There 's one or two race horses I wouldn 't mind sticking a knife in . Yes , well . Now , look . Never mind about that . Why is it so difficult to understand that if you cut a plant or a flower it hurts them , too ? Yeah , well , I suppose it 's possible Henry , but I 'm afraid I just can 't see it . - Well , Mr. Pringle- - - No , no , no . Not Pringle again . What is he ? Some sort of walking encyclopaedia ? Well , when it comes to plant life , yes . Now look . You can check on this , because it actually happened . There was this fella , he wanted to transplant trees . Now , hundreds of years old they were . Well , he tried and tried but they always died . And then it hit him , about this idea , that maybe it was the way they suffered in the moving that killed them , so he gave them an anaesthetic . And it worked . You see , he eased their pain and they survived the operation . Yes , well , it all sounds very civilised , Henry , but you know , it 's a very hard world . Men haven 't stopped killing each other yet , so who 's going to worry about killing off a few flowers ? Well , they will in the end . Me and Mr. Pringle and a few others , we 'll make them . Yep , well I wish you luck , Henry . But you 'll have to find a substitute for rhubarb pie before I join the club . Hey , Norman , that 's it . Hextolenium , you 've got some of it . No , not now , Henry . Don 't go on about that . I 've helped you out in the past , with a few little things for your experiments , but that is a dangerous drug . I can 't give you any of that . Ah , look , Norman , just a little piece . Just enough to cover a tanner , that 's all . Not one grain . It 's more than my life 's worth , Henry . [ phone rings ] Excuse me . Probably my bookmaker . Hello , Clarke 's here . - I 've got to be off then , Norm . - Yes . All right , Henry . Yes . See you later . [ Norman ] Oh , hello , Dr. Hunt . Yes , yes . It just came in this morning . Yes , I 'll get it around as soon as I possibly can . [ door sensor buzzes ] [ engine splutters ] [ door closes ] [ Henry ] Monica , I 'm home ! Monica , where are you , upstairs ? Monica , it 's me ! [ footsteps on stairs ] Oh , what 's the matter , dear ? Aren 't you feeling well again ? Oh , it 's my head , Henry . It came on this afternoon and I just had to come and lie down . Aw , you poor old thing . Is it bad ? Mmm . Oh , I 'm sorry , love . I haven 't got you anything to eat . I tried to , but I just couldn 't manage . It 's all right . Don 't worry about me . I can look after myself . There 's some cold chicken in the fridge , - can you make do with that ? - Of course , it 's just what I fancy . What time is the doctor coming at ? Oh , about seven I think he said . Well , he 'll probably give you something for your headache . Now , look , you just lay down there and try to get some rest , and I 'll bring him up just as soon as he comes . You lie quiet , Mini , won 't you ? Be a good doggy . [ both chuckle lightly ] [ door closes ] There you are , Harriet . Some for you . There 's some for you , Richard . Now , Patsy , mind how you go . Now , don 't gobble it , you 'll get indigestion . Now , here 's some for you , Bertie . There we are . Now , Olga . Listen , now don 't grab . Remember your manners . Here you are , Jack , good old Jack ! He loves his old cockles , don 't you ? [ laughs ] Oh , he 's a good boy . Yeah ! There we are now . Now . Now , Nobby . No . No . Don 't grab hers . There 's plenty for every one . Now , Matilda , listen ! Matilda , don 't get so excited , you 'll lose all your petals if you go on like that . Hold on . All right , George , all right , I 'm coming . I 'm not forgetting about you . Ah , here 's old greedy guts , old Teddy the nosher . I know , I know , that 's all you think about , your grub . [ doorbell rings ] - Dr. Chambers ? - Yes , Mrs. Wilkes asked me to call . I 'm Mr. Wilkes , please come in . Monica 's lying down , it 's one of her headaches . We better see what we can do , eh ? Oh yeah , if you just follow me , Doctor . [ footsteps approaching ] All right , dear ? This is Dr. Chambers . - How do you do ? - More to the point is , how are you ? Oh , I feel a little a better now , thank you . Good . Good . I 'm glad to hear it . I 'll be downstairs , Doctor , if you want me . Well , Mrs. Wilkes . Has the headache really gone ? Almost . Well , I 'll give you something for that in a minute . But first let 's see what this says , shall we ? How did you feel this morning ? Did you have the headache then ? No . No . I was all right . - Were you depressed ? - Yes , for a while . Now , look straight ahead . But it wore off , eh ? Yes , it went away after Henry said he 'd take me for a holiday . I see . What about yesterday ? Well , I was all right early on , but then I began to feel low about lunch time . And the morning before ? Oh , I was all right . Yes , I was quite chirpy . I remember , I took Mini for a walk . You 're very fond of Mini , aren 't you ? - Oh yes . Yes , she 's lovely . - Yes , she is . All right , Mrs. Wilkes . I hope you 've had a cup of tea recently ? - Yes , I had one this morning . - That 's the ticket . I want you to use this for me . I 'll go and have a word with your husband and call back for it . - All right ? - All right . [ door closes ] [ laughing ] Greenfly ? No , I thought it was but it 's just a smut of soot . There 's something strange about this garden , what is it ? Yes well , I suppose it is a bit unusual . There 's something . Can 't quite make out- - Did you examine Monica ? What do you think ? Well , as far as I can tell at the moment , it 's a nervous complaint . Yes . That 's what Dr. Hunt said . Yes , I know . I 've spoken to him . Your wife appears to be in a state of anxiety . Do you know of anything that 's particularly worrying her ? Well , I 've thought about it , I can 't seem to get to the bottom of it . Could it be financial ? Well , we 're not well off but , you know . There are no debts , no HP ... the rent 's paid . Perhaps it 's you that worries her ? Me ? Well , you 're not fooling about with another woman , are you ? Of course not . No . No , it 's nothing like that . Well , I just wanted to know . I 'll give her something to make her sleep before I go . Let her get a good night 's rest . But I 'd like you to have this made up tomorrow . And see that she takes it , will you ? Yes , I 'll do that , Doctor . [ water trickles ] I asked your husband if he knew what it was that worries you , he couldn 't tell me , can you ? Well you see it might sound silly but , it 's the garden . You 're afraid of the garden ? Yes , I am . You see , I told you it sounds silly . No , not at all . Have you always been afraid of it ? I mean , it was here when you took the house . No , I mean to begin with it was quite a nice garden , but ... Well , look at it now , you can see it from the window . It dominates the whole house . Yes , I 've seen it , it is a bit over-awing , I 'll admit . When did it start ? I mean when did you begin to be afraid ? It was soon after he began writing to Mr. Pringle . Who 's Mr. Pringle ? Oh , I don 't know . I wish I did . I 'd write and I 'd ask him to leave us alone . I did write to him once , only he didn 't answer me . Of course , I couldn 't tell Henry about it so I just had to let it drop . Is he a friend of your husband ? Or somebody he works with , perhaps ? No , no . You see my Henry 's gardening mad , he always has been . And one day there was this thing in the paper on how to grow tropical plants . Well , Henry answered it and some roots came by the post . Oh , after that , things just seemed to go wrong . ln what way ? Oh , it 's difficult to explain , really . First there was the fish pond . We planted Mr. Pringle 's roots next to it , and the next morning all the fish had disappeared . Then one day we woke up and found the greenhouse smashed to pieces . There 's probably some very logical explanation . Hooliganism , or a spiteful neighbour perhaps ? Yes , I know , I shouldn 't really blame Mr. Pringle but I do know that he 's upset our lives . He sent more flowers and more roots and Henry got so worked up he started making experiments . What sort of experiments ? He injects the flowers with chemicals and all sorts of things . Oh , those flowers are wrong , Doctor . They don 't belong in this country , yet they survive the climate . They live all through the winter and never die . Oh , it 's weird . Well , I 'm afraid I don 't know enough about gardening to agree or disagree with you . But , couldn 't it just be that your husband is good at his hobby ? No , there 's more to it than that . He talks to them . I 've heard him . He 's got names for every one . And sometimes I think they even talk to him . Mrs. Wilkes , you 're a very sensitive person , and like all sensitive people , you have a vivid imagination . Now , I want you to forget all about this garden and just concentrate on getting well again . You know , you 're in the doldrums . you 've got to snap out of it . Perk yourself up . - All right , Doctor . I 'll try . - That 's right . I 'll come and see you again in two or three days ' time . - Goodbye for now . - Bye . [ door closes ] Had a good night , Nobby ? Feeling trim for a bright new day ? [ lady singing ] What ? Oh ! You old fake , I know what you want . You want your morning tickle don 't you ? Come on , just a couple of minutes . Come on . [ laughing ] Ooh , you little old plonker , I 'll tickle your belly for ya . I 'll give you what for . You great big silly old faggot . I 'll tickle your old ... ouch ! George , who did that ? [ giggling ] Oh ! Well , you 're looking a lot better , how do you feel ? Oh , Better Henry . Much better . The doctor says I 'm in the doldrums and I 've got to snap out of it . So I 'm snapping out of it ! Oh , that sounds more like it . Yes , I 'm glad we called him in . He seems to have done the trick , doesn 't he ? Oh , he 's a good doctor , Henry . Did you see how well I slept last night ? Yes , you was off like a top when I came up . Well , I 've just got to pull myself together , haven 't I ? Look , I 'll tell you what . Now that you 're on the road to recovery , I 'll make arrangements about the holiday . What about that , eh ? Yeah . We 'll give Miss Lovejoy two or three more weeks to get used to the shop . - and we 'll be off . - Oh , I can hardly wait , Henry . Oh , I 'm sorry I 've been so silly . You have to go out and work hard all day and you come home and find me all miserable . You must get properly fed up with me . You soppy old thing . You 've been ill , now you 're gonna get better . Oh ! Look at the time . Miss Lovejoy will have opened up again . Go on . I 'll tidy up for you . I left my other glove , I forgot . Ouch ! [ giggling ] Henry ! What on Earth ? It 's that wretched boy again ! [ chuckles ] Come on , I 'll clean you up . I 'll get him one of these days . I 'll skin him alive when I do . Oh , it 's not all that bad . And you was a boy once remember . [ screaming ] What 's that ? What 's happened ? [ screaming ] Nobby ! Stop it ! Stop that ! Nobby ! Stop it ! Let go , Nobby let go ! Let go , will you ! ? What were you doing ? What happened ? I 've got to take you to hospital . - Get off ! Let me go ! - Wait a minute . Leave me alone ! You must have been doing something . You must 've been up to something . He must have been doing something . He must have fallen off the wall and cut himself . Monica ! I was just going to ring . It 's the wife . She isn 't very well . Headaches again ? No , she 's all nerves . She was fine , in great order . Then some horrible little boy fell off the wall , and started her off again . It 'll be all right , Mr. Wilkes , if you want to go home and look after her . - No , No , I don 't think so . No . - All right then . I wonder , should I get in touch with Mr. Pringle ? Ooh , I nearly forgot . The cockles hadn 't arrived when the driver left , so he came on without them . No cockles . I must have cockles ! What am I going to do without cockles ? There wasn 't anything I could do . Oh , look , don 't take any notice of me . I 'm just thinking of myself again . I 'm the biggest cockle eater in the business . Look ... Why don 't you make some coffee while we 're not busy ? [ creaking , squeaking ] [ Mini barks ] [ hums ] Ahh , thank you , Anne . Thank you . Would you like a biscuit with it ? Ooh , they 're my favourites . Thank you . Thank you very much . All this trouble after I went off the way I did about your tomato sandwiches yesterday . Ahh , look , that was silly of me . I apologise . It wasn 't silly at all , and I 'm glad you did . It shows me what a kind man you are , Mr. Wilkes . Well , lots of people like flowers but , you even like parsley and tomatoes as well . Most people think I 'm potty but you understand , don 't you ? You 're one of the few . What do you do with yourself , Anne ? What do I do with myself ? You know , in the evening after work ? Oh , all sorts of things . It all depends really . Last night ? What did you do last night ? Last night ? Oh , nothing much . You 'd only laugh if I told you . I wouldn 't laugh . I wouldn 't laugh , Anne . If you disclosed to me a personal secret , I certainly wouldn 't laugh at you . No , you wouldn 't , because you 're a gentleman . I went to a spiritualist meeting . Oh , are you a spiritualist , then ? No , but in a way it links up with something I really do believe in . Reincarnation . I think about that sometimes . It would be nice to come back and finish off everything - you wanted to , wouldn 't it ? - That 's why I went . You see If there are spirits , it means we 're not just stone dead when we die . We could be hanging about somewhere waiting to be reincarnated . Yeah . I think you 're right . I think a lot depends on how we behave in this life . If we 're rotten , we turn up again as a rat or a beetle . Well , that 's a bit grim . But if we 're good , we come back as human beings , and become big successes in our chosen professions . Ooh , God knows what I 'll turn up as then . Oh , that 's easy . You 'd become a great authority on gardening . I think I 'd plump for science if I had a choice . Then I could invent things and be really sure of what I 'm doing , instead of guessing all the time . I 'd direct all my intelligence towards plants and flowers , and concentrate until I made everybody else think about them the same as I do . You mean you 'd like everybody to be kind to flowers ? Yes . You 're a very unselfish man , Mr. Wilkes . Oh , I 'm not really . Now , let 's see , what about you ? Of course , I don 't know you well enough to guess what you 'll be in the future , but I think I know what you 've been in your last life . A tulip . Well , because you 're slender and graceful . I 'm not slender , I 'm podgy . More like I was a cabbage . No , no , no . No , definitely a tulip . And Monica , my wife , Monica , she must 've been a carnation , because she is fluffy and uses perfume . [ footsteps ] Ahh , here we are . Back to work . Ahh , there you are . I 'm terribly sorry , it 's not here again . Later on probably . All right , thank you . Anne ? Would you do something for me ? Of course , what is it ? Look , I 've got to go out but then I 've got to go around and tell Norman something . Now , if I go in there he 'll keep me jawing all day . And you want me to go in and tell him ? No . No , just telephone him . He likes to back horses and I 've got a tip here for him . Yes , here it is . Tomboy , the last race , at Alexandra Park . Tell him to be sure to back it and say that it 's from Mr. Pringle . All right . Tomboy , last race , Alexandra Park . I 'll go and do it now before I forget . Oh ! Oh , yes . Well in that case , I 'll just pop out right away . [ phone rings ] [ Norman ] Hello . Clarke 's . Yes Who ? Henry Wilkes ? Really ? Hang on a minute , I 'll just get a pencil . Wait . [ Norman ] Yes , go on I 've got one . Yes , go on . That 's Tomboy , in the last race at Ally Pally . Mr. Pringle ? Really ? You tell Henry it 'd better win or else . All right ? Thank him for me , won 't you ? Tell him there 's hope for him yet . All right , goodbye . [ door sensor buzzes ] Monica ! I 'm home ! Oh , hello , dear . How are you feeling ? Any Better ? Did you hear me , Monica ? Monica . What are you doing ? I want you to drive me to the station , Henry . I 've phoned Maud , and I 'm going to stay with her . Stay with Maud ? Why ? How long for ? I don 't know how long for ! All I know is I can 't stay in this house one moment longer . But this is our home , Monica . I mean , if you can 't stay here , what are we going to do ? I don 't know , Henry . And I can 't think about it now . Only thing I know is , if I stop here I shall have a nervous breakdown or something . Look , it can 't be that bad . You must be imagining things . Yeah , well maybe I am and that 's just it . I won 't stop imagining things Henry , as long as I stay in this house . Well , look , I thought we 'd sorted all this out ? You know , when we talked about the holiday . Well , I can 't wait that long , I wanna go now . Well , you don 't have to wait . It 's all arranged . I did it today . I don 't believe you . You can 't leave that garden alone for hours , let alone weeks . Well , I am leaving it . It 's all fixed . It 's Cornwall . A little cottage , near Truro . Truro ? Yeah , yeah . I 'm just waiting for them to confirm the date . I asked for Saturday week . Honest ? Honestly . Surely you can wait just a few days ? I mean two weeks down in Cornwall might make all the difference ? You mean we really might be going then Saturday week ? With a bit of luck . We could catch a train , or a bus , or even go on the old bike . And have a picnic on the way . This is your holiday , we 'll do it just as you want . Well , all right then Henry . We 'll wait . We 'll go on holiday and see if it helps . Good old Monica . It will help , I 'm sure it will . You 'll come back a new woman . Wait till you see . That 's my girl . [ plants squeaking in conversation ] Sorry I 'm late , had to take the wife out . You will all be starving . Here you are . Better late than never , huh ? That 's it . Good , Nobby . That 's it . Listen , Nobby , how would you like to be twice as big and strong as you are now , huh ? [ roaring ] Yes , I thought you would . Well , look I 've got the stuff , and if Professor Englehart 's right , you can be . What 's that ? [ roars softly ] Yes . Well we 'll see about that , won 't we ? Now , look , this means an injection , it won 't hurt but you might feel a bit queer for a couple of days . What do you say ? Will you have a go ? [ Nobby roars ] Good boy . Good lad . That 's my Nobby . Game for anything . Now , look , hold on to your roots . It 'll be all over in a couple of minutes . Now here we go . [ Nobby groans ] There you are . That wasn 't so bad , was it ? Worse things happen at sea , don 't they ? Well , I 've got to be up in the morning so I 'll say good night . Try to get a good night 's sleep won 't you ? Good night , good night . Shh . Quiet now . Good night . [ indistinct chattering ] Oh , sorry to keep you waiting , I was just out in the yard . Here , what 's the lark ? What are you , a nutcase ? Oh . It 's just plastic ! Course it 's bleeding plastic ! What d 'yer think it was , nut chocolate ? Give us it here , come on ! I 'm sorry . I thought it was real . Real ! You 're real ! A real twit ! Give us a pair of them kippers before yer go right off yer rocker . I don 't know what 's come over people these days , swelt me blind , I don 't . It ain 't safe to go out of doors for five minutes . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I made a mistake . Look , here , have these on me . Just a little present . Yes , I should think so , too . I dunno , you can 't even go out and buy a pair of kippers without getting raped ! - Well , I 'm sorry . - Yes , I should think so ! [ mumbling ] I don 't know . Come in here , get assaulted ... I think this is the one , Mr. Wilkes . There are hundreds of addresses in this one . Oh , yes . Yes , we should find something in here . Monica fancies ... Monica fancies Cornwall . Yeah , somewhere near Truro . Well , that should be easy enough . They 're all in alphabetical order . Cheshire , Chichester ... [ whistling ] [ doorbell rings ] [ continues whistling ] Morning , Mrs. Wilkes , how many today ? Now , let me see- - Oh , I like that . Yes , that 's a nice one , that is . I thought it was better than usual , I must be getting the knack . Well , you ought to , you 've had a few go goes at it , haven 't you ? Well , I 'm after something that 's perfect . Because you see , to me , Mini is perfect . Oh , yeah , they grow on you , don 't they ? It 's the same with my cat . Rules the house , he does . Grabs the best chair , gets his dinner before I get mine , does as he likes . He 's a proper little Lord of the Manor . Oh , I 'm glad to know I 'm not the only softie about . Do you know , sometime- - [ telephone rings ] Oh , who can that be ? Will you excuse me ? And can you leave me two pints , please ? Two pints eh ? Right-o . Hello , Doctor . Oh , yes , thank you . I 'm feeling a lot better . Well , I was a bit depressed last night actually , but Henry came home and took me to the pictures . Oh , yes , we had a lovely evening out and now I feel a lot more cheerful . Oh , yes , I 've been sleeping a lot better , thank you . No , no , I haven 't noticed it . [ Mini barking ] Mini ! Mini ! Mini ! Mini , where are you ? [ barking continues ] Mini ? Mini ? [ plants squeaking eerily , groaning ] Here girl . Good girl . Come on . Mini ! Mini ! Mini ? Here , girl . Come on , Mini ! Mini ! Mini , where are you ? Here , girl . Good girl . Mini ! Mini , come on , Mini . Mini . [ gasps ] [ Nobby roaring ] [ eerie squeaking , groaning ] [ squeaking , groaning becomes frantic ] You 're sure you don 't mind ? Only I 'd like to tell Monica it 's all fixed . Well , I 'll be able to manage , won 't I ? I mean , if you 're leaving on Saturday - she 'll want to start packing . - Yeah . Oh , look , let 's have a look at that address again ? Penwarden Farm , near Truro . That 's it . - See you in about an hour . - All right . - I hope she 'll be pleased . - Oh , she will be . Bye-bye . [ Henry ] Monica ! You 'd better start packing ! We leave for Cornwall on Saturday . Monica , you upstairs ? Monica , it 's all fixed for Saturday ! [ footsteps on stairs ] Oh , what 's up ? Hey , what 's the matter ? What 's happened ? Monica , what 's happened ? Speak to me . Say something . Monica . Where 's Mini ? Monica , you 're ill . It 's a nervous breakdown . I 'll get the doctor . Look , don 't worry , Monica . I 'll get him right away . [ door closes ] [ footsteps on stairs ] Nonsense ! You know Mr. Wilkes well enough to know he wouldn 't steal anything . Then why did he get you to make that phone call , telling me to back a horse that wasn 't even running ? I don 't know . It must have been a joke . No , that was yesterday . If it had been a joke he would have been in to see my by now . You know he 's been making plans for his holiday . He 's a crank . He carries out weird experiments , that 's why he stole that drug , I know ! There 's nothing weird about them , he 's only trying to help people . He 's never harmed anybody in his life . Look , he 's never had a large quantity of dangerous drugs before . He 's an amateur , a dabbler . Heaven knows what he 'll get up to . Look , I know you 're making a mistake , and when he comes in , I 'll tell him to come in and see you . Yes , well , he 'd better that 's all , because if he 's not here within an hour I 'm going to see the police . Oh , oh ! I 'm afraid she 's extremely ill . She seems to have had a very bad shock since I last saw her . Now , do you know what could have caused it ? Is she going to be all right ? The mind 's a funny thing . We can 't be certain . But she needs care and attention . Does she have to go to hospital ? No , I think a nursing home would be better . I know of a quite inexpensive place where she 'll be well looked after . If you agree , I 'll phone and see if they can take her . Yes , yes , of course . Your wife hates this garden , doesn 't she ? Can 't say that I blame her . It 's ... Wait . I know . I know what 's wrong . There are no birds ! A big garden like this and not a sound of a bird anywhere . No . No birds ever come in here . - No , they won 't let them . - Eh ? Who won 't let them ? The flowers . They 've got minds of their own . They think . They 've got feelings too . You might say I 've educated them . I 'm afraid I 'm not quite with you . Mr. Pringle tells me how to look after them , but it 's the love and kindness that counts in the end . They get the best of everything . Fresh rabbits , cockles ... Did you say rabbits ? Do you mean they 're carnivorous ? Yes , and they get stimulants too , of course , the lack of knowledge slows me up , but I think I 'm getting somewhere . I 'll show them all . Professor Englehart will be surprised when he discovers how far I 've progressed . Yes , well , I 'll go and make that phone call . [ dog barking ] Mini ? Is that you , Mini ? Mini ! [ barking continues ] Oh , that 's good . Yes , that will be fine . And tell Dr. Williams I 'd like him to have a look at her , and I 'll be around this evening to discuss the case with him . Oh , and I 'd like him to see the husband also . He seems to have some kind of obsession , which I think has a lot to do with Mrs. Wilkes ' trouble . Something to do with his garden , but I 'll explain it all when I see Dr. Williams . Right . Yes . I 'll wait here for the ambulance . Goodbye . [ phone rings ] Hello ? No , Dr. Chambers here . [ eerie squeaking ] [ dog barking ] [ plants roaring ] Yes . Well , I think you 'll have to close the shop on your own . No , he won 't be able to get back this afternoon , his wife is extremely ill and he is not well himself either . All right , I 'll tell Mr. Wilkes . If he decides otherwise he 'll ring you . Right . Thank you . Goodbye . [ Henry ] Doctor ! Dr. Chambers ! Doctor ! Doctor . Quick ! Hurry ! She 's dead ! How did this happen ? And what 's all this ? They killed her . She wanted to go to her sister but I stopped her . Now they 've killed her ! Shouldn 't be long . [ doorbell rings ] It doesn 't look as if he 's in . Try again . - Mr. Wilkes ? - No , my name is Chambers , - I 'm Mr. Wilkes ' doctor . - Doctor ? Well I 'm a police officer . I 'd like a word with Mr. Wilkes about some missing drugs . [ grunting , groaning ] All right . We don 't want any more of that do we ? [ sobbing inconsolably ] All right now . Calm down ! Thank you , that will be three and nine . Ta , dear . So old Wilky 's not well , then ? So the doctor said when I phoned . I 'm worried about the takings , I suppose I could drop them in on my way home . Yeah , then you could see how he was . Then I could get tomorrow 's order as well . Do you know , I think that 's what I 'll do . Well , tell him I hope he 'll be all right soon and to hurry up and get back to the old bloaters . Ta-ta . Bye then . You think I did it , don 't you ? I couldn 't kill Monica . I love her . It was the garden . It was Nobby ! Mr. Wilkes , do you think a jury 's going to believe that a plant killed her ? Now , why don 't you tell me the truth ? I am telling you the truth ! Why don 't you get Mr. Pringle ? He would help me , he knows all about it . Pringle ? Pringle ? Oh , yes , Dr. Chambers mentioned him . He used to supply you with plants . Yes , that 's right . He 's some sort of importer , you can 't get them from anyone else . He knows them . He knows all about them . He 'll tell you it could 've been Nobby . Fraser ! Fraser ! Where does this Pringle live ? 89 Coleman Street , Nechells Green , Birmingham . - You got that ? - Yes . Get through to Birmingham and ask them to pick up a Mr. Pringle there and bring him in for questioning . - Right . - And I want to know as soon as they 've got him . Right , now , we 'll go through it again . Dr. Chambers left you in the garden to make a phone call . - Yes . - Your wife was in the bedroom . [ doorbell rings ] Well , don 't you see ? The experiments went wrong . The garden 's evil , it 's got to be smashed before it hurts anyone else . [ Fraser ] Reply from Birmingham . Coleman Street was demolished five years ago , part of a redevelopment plan . That can 't be true ! I send letters there every week . I mean , Mr. Pringle answers them ! How could he answer them if he didn 't get them ? - Look , are you sure ? - They sent a car round to check . Could it have been another name ? Similar to Coleman Street ? Well , course not . I should know , I 've been writing to him for over a year . Get on to the local Post Office up there . Ask them if they 've been redirecting mail for our friend Pringle . - It might be a bit late . - Well , do your best ! This one 's a right nutter , but we 've got to check everything . Sergeant , about the garden . Couldn 't we get a car ? Look , it 's vital that I get home for just five minutes . Mr. Wilkes ! Mrs. Wilkes ! It 's Miss Lovejoy ! This Pringle , did you ever meet him ? Well , we arranged to meet once in town , but he didn 't turn up . Do you know why he didn 't turn up ? Well , yes , he wrote to me and explained it in a letter . A sort of strange reason , I didn 't understand it . He said that " atmospherical conditions prevented him " . - You mean there was a storm ? - Sort of an electrical storm . I got on to the Post Office , letters have been coming in for that address for the past twelve months . You see , I told you . But as whoever sent them didn 't put any on any return address , all the letters were passed on to the Address Unknown department . Well , you wrote to Pringle , but it seems he didn 't get your letters . He must have , I mean he answered them ! He sent me all the plants I wanted . Only the other day ... Oh , yes ! Well , look , that proves it . I got this just a couple of days ago . See , I 've been telling the truth , all along ! Now , will you let me go home and destroy that garden ? Those plants are evil , who knows what they 'll do next ? Mr. Wilkes ! Mrs. Wilkes ! It 's Miss Lovejoy from the fish shop . Mr. Wilkes . I 've brought the cockles . [ squeaking ] [ screaming ] But if the plants didn 't come from Mr. Pringle , where did they come from ? Now , I shouldn 't worry about that Mr. Wilkes . Probably from out of space . Now , take Mr. Wilkes downstairs and get him a cup of tea . Well , aren 't you gonna take me home ? [ Crouch ] Later on . Maybe later on . But what about the garden ? God , man , you 've got to believe me . Go downstairs . Fraser will look after you . Come along , Mr. Wilkes . Look , Officer , if you won 't let me go . Then you go . Go and destroy that garden ! It 's got to be destroyed ! Yes . I 'll do that for you . Now , come along , Mr. Wilkes . Let 's go downstairs shall we ? Let 's go downstairs and have a nice cup of tea . Come along now . Don 't you worry about the garden . We 'll take care of that for you . You 'll be all right . Come along now . There we are . [ ringing ] Crouch here . Another strangled ? Where ?

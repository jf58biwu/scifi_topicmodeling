 Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on Americas greatest and most secret project - The Time Tunnel , Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time , Tony ! - Wheres the rest of the crew ? - Trapped . Trapped . Over 200 ofem . All trapped . This way ! Its blocked off here . Go the other way . Hey. you ! Get out of here ! Hold on ! - Whats happened ? - Some men trapped back there . - How many ? - Must be 200 . You better get out of here . Therell be more explosions . - Weve got to get them out ! - No ! Thatss my job ! Now you get out of here ! Tony ! Tony ! Doug ! Doug . Im here ! - Are you all right ? - Yes ! Listen . I can get to the surface ! Ill bring help ! - Well get you out , ! - Okay ! Ill be right back ! - Wheres the rescue crew ? - There isntt any . What ? All those men down there . theyll die . Whats the difference ? Theyrre no better than the rest of us . Now you pick up that phone and you get some men together . - Whod come now ? - What are you talking about ? What else is there to talk about. mister ? That-That thing out there . The Time Tunnel . Dr. Swain . Rome ! Thats St. Peterss Square . And not too far back , No earlier than the turn of the century , What are they looking at ? Ann. can you change your viewing angle ? Im trying . Ah . Youve lost contact . No. wait . Im getting a response again . No. wait a minute . Thats not St. Peterss . Anybody recognize it ? It looks semitropical . Ann ? Could be South America . Buenos Aires. perhaps . Oh. its fading again . That could be England . Or is it Wales ? Youre right about the period . Ray . Look at those clothes . Ann. youre losing picture again . Cantt you hold it in one place ? No . We have a time fix . but we just havent located them in space . Thats why it keeps shifting . A comet. early 20th century . Of course ! Halleys Comet . Jerry ! Jerry. get Research to give us everything theyve got on Halleyss Comet . Right away . General . Its last approach was. lets see - 1910. late spring . Yes . That checks with my readings here . Try the spatial control now . Contact ! - Its Doug . - You got the fix . Ann . Now clarify the image . Somebodys got to help those men or theylll all die . Nobody can save em . We cantt save ourselves . Then Ill do it alone . Doug ! Doug. is that you ? Hang on ! Ill get you out ! Are you all right ? - Where are the miners ? - Trapped in the next shaft . Can we dig them out ? I dont know . The main cave-in happened at the far end . Wed better get out of here . - This ones about to go too , - What about those men ? We cantt just leave eeem here to die . We need help . All the men we can get . Well. where are they ? Why arent they here ? Come on ! He tells me there are 200 men trapped in that bottom shaft . So now there are two of you . I dont recall seeing either one of you around here before tonight . - Who are you anyway ? - What difference does it make ? Theres a whole shift trapped down there . and no oness lifting a finger to help them . - No help for em now . No help for anybody . - What are you talking about ? Havent you heard ? The worldss coming to an end . Take a look out there . Tony . - May 1910 . Thats Halleyss Comet . - Thatsss right . Is that what you mean by the end of the world ? Well , youre wrong , That cometss not gonna hit us , Itsss gonna pass by , Oh. you know more than the experts. huh ? - As a matter of fact . I do . - Thats right . Henderson . That comet wontt do any damage . - By this time tomorrow. itll be gone . - Itlll be gone . So will we . Mister. youre gonna let 200 men die because of a mistake . Nothing I can do about that . As far as those men down in the hole go ... - I expect theyre already dead , - Well. maybe not . They might be dead at that . Tony . That last cave-in was a big one . Doug. we cant assume anything until we know for sure . - Who was in charge down there ? - Blaine . Best young gang boss on the payroll . - Yeah. well. he saved my life . - I feel real sorry for him . But theres no helping a dead man . - Thats a direct line to the shaft . - Yeah ? This is Blaine . Were trapped in the third level . We cantt get through . - How long can you hold out ? - I dont know . The situations pretty bad . How soon before a rescue crew can get here ? They want to know when the rescue crew will get to them . How do I tell them there isnt one ? Theyll be better off where they are . If they got out. theyd - theydd have to face that . - Do they know about the comet ? - No . When the word came. theyd already gone down below . If you didnt intend to help those men . why did you bother to hang around here ? Didnt appear to be any purpose in goin anywhere . The way I look at it . youre as bad off one place as another . Whats happening ? I cantt hear anything . Blaine . The rescue crews getting organized . Just hold out . You hear that. men ? Helps comin .. Tell em to hurry ! Tell eem - Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? - Heres the research you asked for on the comet . General . - Right . Thank you . Well. its getting closer to Earth every minute . No wonder the people back there were scared . According to this . it came even closer before it veered off . Is there any way it could affect this complex ? What youre seeing . General . happened nearly 60 years ago . Well. that comets somewhere in our solar system right now . Thats right . It first appeared in 1531 ... again in 1607 ... then it came back in 1682 , 1759 , 1835 , And then in 1910 . But no danger to us today in 1968 . Is there ? Well. as I said before . General . what youre seeing happened nearly 60 years ago . Thats not what I asked . Ray . Idd like a direct answer . Is there any way it can affect this complex ? General. we all know that the Time Tunnel is not perfected . For example , it has only marginal control over Doug and Tony , Weve hardly reached a point where its operation is even 50 % predictable . Youre both still beating about the bush . I want to know . Can that comet affect our complex ? Affirmative or negative ? - Unknown . - Unknown . - You see . General. you dont understand - - Duty here is voluntary . - Would you like to be relieved ? - No. sir . Is there any way we can get a better fix on 1910 ? Well. we can try . General . - Ann. refine polarization. give us a quick scan . - Right . I dont care what youvve been told . The world is not coming to an end . You just gonna sit there and let those men die for nothing ? - Whos Ainsley ? - Hess a professor up at the observatory . A brilliant man . Everybody respects him . Yeah. well. hes dead wrong ! Look . Henderson . were never gonna get a rescue party ... unless we can convince enough men that the world isnt going to end . Yeah . Thats for sure and certain . Suppose I got this Ainsley to retract his statement . to admit that he was mistaken . Would that have any effect on the people around here ? Yes . I - I expect it would . and. well . Ill tell you why . Because a herd of wild horses couldnt make that man say something he didntt believe , Well . I dont think you could. either . Thats all I need to know . because he is wrong . Tony . Im going to get Ainsley to retract his position . How ? - Tell him where we come from ? - No . The last thing in the world is we want these people to think were out of our minds . If only we could get Ray or somebody back at that complex to send us some modern instruments . - We dont even know if they can still read us . - Yeah . I know . Im just gonna have to demonstrate the facts the best I can . Thatll take too long . Those men need help right now . Tony . I know what Im doing . Youvve got to believe me . Okay . Try it . But Ill do it my way . - After youve seen Ainsley. meet me back here . - Hey. where are you going ? Into town . We need men to help . Hang it all , Tom , I havent got a deputy to send , I dont care whatss happening over there , I havent got nobody . Nobody at all . Tell you what. try Philipsburg . Could be theyre in better shape than we are . All right . Tom. all right . Just keep your shirt on . Thats a good one . Me send deputies . Theres been a bad cave-in down at the mine . I need men. lots of them . Oh. you do ? Where do you figure on gettin eem ? Arent there any men around here at all ? Son . I know theres trouble at the mine . I heard the disaster whistle . but I didnt pay it much mind ... not with the whole town runnin off like a bunch of scared horses . There are 200 men down there . If we dont dig them out soon. theylll all die ! - Yeah . I expect they will . - Well. arent you gonna do anything about it ? Theres just so much one man can do . Sheriff s office . Oh. hello . Owen . What ? Oh , thats a real shame , No , No , theress nothing here at all , Im sorry , boy , but I cantt help you , No , No , it wont do no good tryinCCarver , Theyre up to their necks in trouble over there , No . No. not a chance . Im real sorry . Look. a handful of men . Thats all I need . Just a handful ! That was the county seat on the line just then . Their whole towns on fire . The whole town . And all I could tell em was let it burn , Where can I find somebody ? Anybody at all that might help ? Son. have you got any notion what a big thing this is ? Thats from the governor . Riot in the state capitol . National Guard mobilized . And he wants me to send men . Me. with nobody left here at all . What about the townspeople ? They havent just vanished off the face of the Earth . Try Pilgrimage Hill at the south end of town . Thats where they all run off to . - Took off ? Why ? - Seems like they all tooKup with religion all of a sudden , Theyre praying and waitin ... and thatssss about all a man can do right now . No much time for that either . Im sorry. son . I wish I could help you . I really do. but my job is right here . No matter what anybody else does . Im sticking by this post now . Good luck to you . Sheriff s office . Oh. hello . Johnny . No . Twenty men ? No. impossible . I havent got a man to spare . Not a single man . For your information ... every major observatory we could reach has confirmed my calculations . I cant help that . Professor Ainsley . That comet will not collide with the Earth . It wont even pass close enough to have measurable effect on it . My dear sir . I wish I could believe you . You can . There isnt a doubt in the world . Well. in that case . Id be delighted to go over the calculations ... - that have led you this happy conclusion , - Ive made none . I see . Well. then theres simply no point to further discussion . Theres every point ! All those miners will die unless you publicly admit your error . You may have made no calculations . but I have . Checked and rechecked 50 times by the finest minds in the university . The very finest . Who are you to challenge all this ? Professor. if I were to tell you about myself . you wouldnt begin to believe me . But if I know anything in this world . I know that that comet will not hit . My dear sir. were all in the same boat . My staff has deserted me . But I intend to stay here and take observations until - Well. as long as I can . Will you permit me to prove my point ? - How ? Dont tell me yourre a scientist . - I am . - Then Id be interested in seeing your proof . - Thank you . I can supply you with any data you may require . Round up some men , As many as you can get , Theres been a cave-in at the mine , Need help at the mine . Theres been a cave-in . The men are trapped . Theres been a cave-in at the mine . We need volunteers . Round up some men . as many as you can get . Whats the matter with you people ? Listen to me ! You listen to me ! I need volunteers ! Thats not gonna hit ! Do you hear me ? Its not the end of the world ! Whats the matter with you people ? Listen to me ! You listen to me , ! I need volunteers , ! Doug cant hope to prove much with the instruments of the period of 1910 . If he only had a radarscope to work with . - We have one . - No . Ann . I dont want to risk sending anything back . Not until we get a more stable fix on them . It seems to me its worth the risk. right ? With a radarscope . he could prove his point in short order . Oh . I dont know . General . - Oh . I agree with the general . I think we should gamble on it . - All right. lets do it . Come on . Jerry. take over the controls . Ill make the arrangements . Now give us a fix on the comet . Jerry . I want to get more readings . Dr. Swain. what if I switch to the mine shaft ? - Maybe we could move those poor guys down there . - Not a chance . Jerry . - I dont think we should focus too long on this comet . - Why ? Well . I was just thinking . If our focus puts us within its magnetic field - What possible effect could that have on - Masses of opposite polarity attract each other. sir . The magnetic forces would blow out every power unit in this complex . Aside from the fact wed have a big repair bill on our hands ... would we learn anything if that should happen ? Yes. sir . So far. weve learned more from failure than success . Hold the focus . And sharpen it . Henderson ? Oh . I just came over to see what I could do to help . Howd you make out on the hill ? - Theres nobody with me . - Imm not surprised . - Wheres Henderson ? - Nobody here when I came . - Reckon he took off for the hills . - Yeah . I guess so . Well. lets not just stand here . Letss go dig these fellas out . Henderson ! Well. you know-you know. young fella . you got me to thinkin . Evenin . Sheriff . A man has no call to sit around and wait for the end . When it comes , he ought to be doinsomethin .. So , here I am , Sheriff. get that pick working . - Get to work . Do you good . - Now wait a minute . Three of us cant do anything until we bring some timbers down and shore up these walls . Whats the difference ? Whatss another cave-in among friends ? - Hey. cut that out . Hey. cut it out ! - Get back ! Get back ! Its the same everywhere - looting. burning. pillaging . No wonder they thought it was the end of the world . The radarscope is ready to send back . - Good . Get it in the tunnel . - Right . - Jerry. get a fix on Dr. Phillips . - Yes. sir . Heres the speed per second . Does that check with your charted orbit ? - Check . - Angle of perihelion and - Yes ? - Impact . - Of course . Youve done it beautifully . And youve confirmed my findings . Interrupt the reception . Stand by for switching . Now . - What went wrong ? - Imperfect fix. obviously . Jerry. zero in on the comet again . - Well get our time coordinates from there . - Yes. sir . It checks . Every observation. every figure ... - checks , - Naturally . I told you that in beginning . And yet I know that that comet will not hit . You keep saying that . Youre an exceptionally intelligent man . Youve given me ample proof of that . And yet you say this with a conviction thats very nearly mystical . Id appreciate an explanation . I wish I could give you one . - Maybe if I could contact Tony . - Tony ? - This line is dead . - Im not surprised . The operator. like everybody else . has given up . After all. we only have ... two hours and 25 minutes until the end of everything . - Are you all right ? - Guess so . Maybe I aint so easy to kill . Hold it . Hold it . Hold it . Youll start another slide . - Go on , get out , - Uh-uh . I aint leaving you here like this . Poor Henderson , He wasnt so lucky , - Better get to the surface while you still can . - What about you ? - Try to get some help . Its the only way . - There aintt nobody up there . Ill get you out . Whats the matter ? Huh ? What ? Everybody giving up ? Uh. right now theres probably a hundred men - 200 - digging a passage to us . Theyre doing everything they can . Were gonna be free . You hear me ? Huh ? Were gonna be free . Poor devils . They really are convinced its the end of the world . It will be for some . - Doctor. theres something odd going on . - How do you mean ? - Remember what you said about the magnetic attraction of masses ? - Yes . What about it ? Wouldnt the comet and Earth assert attractive forces on each other ? Of course . Jerry . But. practically speaking ... Halleys Comet today is several billion miles away from - - Jerry. youre not keeping a constant fix on the comet . - Thatss what I mean . I canttt . Theres something weird about this thing . about the way it affects the controls . Come on . Let me take over . The time is very nearly upon us . Ainsley. every piece of information we have tells us that comet is going to hit . - Exactly . - Suppose it doesnt . Just suppose . An hypothesis . What could interfere with it at the last moment ? Only one thing. obviously . Some mass great enough to divert it from its trajectory . Thats it . A mass in the heavens . No. no . Thats impossible . There isntt one ... - or we would have observed it , - A dark mass that reflects no light . - Now your instruments couldnt pick that up , could they ? - Well. no . Well. its there . I know itss there . If we only had a radarscope . - I beg your pardon ? - Uh. never mind . What else could we use ? Lets see . 1910 . 1910 . Is it too early for the radiometer ? The Nichols Radiometer . There arent a half dozen of them in existence . - Do you have one ? - As a matter of fact. we do . - A gift to the university . But I still dont see - - Get it for me. please . - Ill prove my thesis to you . Hurry ! - Very well . No ! No. youll bury the both of us ! Thats a chance we both have to take . All those people and not one willing to help . Standing there in that field holding those stupid torches ... looking up at the sky like they could hardly wait to die . I guess its hard to tell how a person will react if they believe theyrre gonna die . For me . Id rather face it like old Henderson there ... or those poor devils in the lower shaft . - A crude device. but it just may work . - Crude ? This is the most advanced instrument of its kind in existence . Of course . Lets get it hooked up to the telescope. shall we ? - Make a focus . Ill monitor the dial . - Right . Start your scanning . - Are you getting anything yet ? - Nothing . Take another segment . Wait ! Go back about one degree . There ! Freeze ! - What are you getting ? - Intense radiant energy . - What do you see ? - Nothing ! Not a darn thing ! Then its - itss true . Look here . I told you . Theres an object up there . A nonreflecting mass of something . You cant pick it up visually ... - but its there , - I cantt argue about that . Is the mass big enough to affect the trajectory of the comet ? More than enough . Observe . Itll start exerting its pull at this point . The tail will appear to vanish as it starts to veer off . Youre right . Itss going to miss the Earth . - Weve got to get this news out . - Well. you wontt do it that way . Youve got to go up to the hills and tell the people , Ill explain on the way . Come on ! You people , you dont Know me , But you know this man - Professor Ainsley of the observatory . Hes the man who told you when this comet was going to hit . You believed him then . Listen to him now . I was wrong . Do you understand ? Wrong . The world will not end . The comet will not destroy us , The suns going to rise as it always has , Nothing will be changed , The comet will go out into space where it cannot harm us , Whats the matter with you people ? Hess telling you the truth ! Wait . Ill prove it . Look at the comet . See the tail ? The tail is a cloud offlaming gas , Its going to vanish . Professor. tell them exactly when that tail will vanish . In exactly ... 15 seconds from now . Ten seconds . Five seconds . - You better be right . - I am . - Two. one - - Look ! Professor. bring these people down . Im gonna get back to the mine . Doctor. theres a bit of smudge on your cheek . There . Youve got the fix . Now hold it . Yes. but Im getting a strange reaction on the dials . You see that ? Theyve gone completely wild . - That is strange . - Whats the problem ? Some external force we cant identify . Itss exerting some kind of magnetic pull . Its the comet . Werre locked in on it . Itsss coming right in on us ! Jerry. get ahold of yourself . Thats an image . It cantt possibly affect us . Get back to your post . You said that opposites masses attract . Jerry. thats 1910 . But the tunnel connects us with 1910 in time ... now ! All right . Ann . Ill take over . We learn from failure . you said . But we cant afford a failure that would destroy the tunnel . Is it possible that something that happened in 1910 could touch us physically ? Jerrys right . The Time Tunnel does connect us with the comet . Were in the same time segment . Dontt you see ? The quotient of the value of time - Segment . Quotient . You can prove anything with words. equations . - Im talking about a commonsense definition of time . - Commonsense definition ? To my knowledge . no one has ever succeeded in defining time . Jerry. cut the power ! - Cut it off ! . - Power off ! . All systems ! - Jerry. cut the power ! I said cut it ! - I have cut it off ! . - Whats wrong ? - The powerss jumping the circuit breakers ! - But thats not possible ! - I know. but itss happening . Clear the Tunnel Complex ! All personnel. out ! Clear the complex ! The powers off ! . I dontt understand it ! It should stop ! LooKout , ! LooKout , ! Hold on , ! Help ! Help me ! Jerry ! Ahh ! Jerry ! Help me ! - Hold on ! - Cut the power grid ! Shut that down ! Help ! Jerry . You all right ? Here . Come on . Come on. here . Over here . - Whats the matter ? - He stopped breathing . - His heart has stopped . - Its a massive electrical shock . Get the emergency resuscitator ! On the double ! - Hurry ! - Quick ! Get his breathing started . - Hes not responding . - Here . Pressure on the breastbone . - Start his heart . - Where are those men with the resuscitator ? Here . Put it on him . Help me put this around the back . Right under his heart . Good . All right. now get away from him . All right ! Thats enough . Come on . Jerry . Thats all right . We wontt need it now . - Youre all right . Jerry boy . - Some of you men give him a hand . Youll be all right now . What the devil happened ? We almost brought the comet itself back . Id say that itss time to reexamine the whole project . - Now just what is that supposed to mean ? - Just this . Were dealing with forces of cosmic proportions about which we know little or nothing . The dangers. you mean . Ray. all experimentation has a certain amount of danger . A certain amount . Ann ? Bringing the force of Halleys Comet across a few billion miles ... and right into the Tunnel - a certain amount ? The H-bomb is nothing but a toy balloon compared to the forces were loosening here . Ray. arent you forgetting something ? Doug and Tony ? No . Ann . Im only trying to measure their lives against others werre endangering . - Our own ? - Oh. that isnt fair . Now . Ray has risked his life as often or more often than any of us on this project . - I know . Im sorry . - The thing to do is not to scrap the project ... but to try and build more safeguards around it . General. dont we say that a couple of times a year ? Then we come right back here the next morning ... and start playing with forces beyond imagination . Ray. how long would it take you to repair all this ? I dont know . A few hours. a few days . Well. well have to look it over . If were out of touch with Doug and Tony for too long. we may lose them forever . I know . Ann . I know . Well get the repair crews on it right away . - Whats the time ? - Whatss the difference ? A couple minutes one way or the other wont matter now . If those men are dead . it was all for nothing . Thats exactly how I feel . All for nothing . - Blaine ! - For the love of heaven. help us . - How many are left ? - All of us ... so far . But hurry . We cant hold out . Hold on . Hold on . Well be there . Dont lie to them . give those men false hope . How long ... before you reach us ? I guess youre right . We did it ! Theyre coming down from the hills . A whole mob of them . enough to dig out those tunnels in no time flat . - Blaine . - Whats-Whatss happening ? Whatsss that shouting ? Were on our way . Were on our way ! Theyre coming . Come on. you men ! Hurry up ! Theyve been separated in time . Doug ? Doug , ! Doug , ! See who that is . Hold it right there. mister . Im one of the men in charge of this station . You must be new here . Im Dr. Newman . Imm back . Ive been here 14 months. mister . I never heard of any Dr. Newman . Fourteen months ? But Ive been here every day for the past seven years . Whats the problem. soldier ? Jiggs ? It is you. isnt it ? I didnt recognize you without the mustache . Jiggs. its me . Dr. Newman . Newman ? I never heard of any Newman around here . And. mister . I never had a mustache . What are you talking about ? You know me . Tony Newman . Mister . Ive never seen you before in my life . They brought me back in the wrong time . - He looks younger . - And look at the license plate on that truck . Magnification ! We brought him back 10 years ago . We didnt . It just happened . A fluke . But if hess this close ... Ray , weve got to close a 10-year gap before we lose him , - Why not just go out there ? - Youd see nothing . Yourre in the present . Thats taking place 10 years ago . Whats the trouble here . Sergeant ? Doug ! Doug. they got you back too . You better get going . Doc . We got a weird one here . - Its Phillips . - Yeah . 10 years ago . Newman was still in school . He and Phillips hadnt even met . Good Lord , ! Can you imagine the nightmare Tony must be living through now ? - Ray , cant you do anything ? - Intensify the probe . Well. you better see that he gets a ride back into town . Jiggs . After what hes seen. helll have to answer a few questions for our security officer . Doug . Doug. wait . Tell them who I am ! Doug. tell them who I am ! Doug. tell them who I am ! Doug ! Doug ! Doug. wait ! Wait ! Doug ! On the double ! If he doesnt stop. shoot him ! Tonys broken away . Hess half out of his mind . We need more time to try a return transfer . He doesnt have time , ! Helll resist and those men may Kill him , - Superimpose his signal with Dougs . - Welll lose him . At least the two of them will be together when we try a location probe , Doug ! Doug ! Doug ! Doug ! Everything must be destroyed . Everything . We must leave nothing for tomorrow morning . I will see to it . Professor . - Everything in every office . - Hai , How did you get in ? We. uh - We sort of came in by mistake . What are you doing here ? Who are you ? Were tourists . Uh. just sightseeing . Nobody sightsees inside thejapanese Consulate . I assure you we-we didnt know this was thejapanese Consulate . Everybody in Honolulu knows that . The day before the attack on Pearl Harbor . In thejapanese Consulate . Leave the consulate at once . - Please . - Try for a time lock. quick. before we lose them . Power ! All units ! Were sorry to have intruded . They are spies . Why let them escape ? Because their superiors would trace them to us ... and it would be dangerous to create an incident today . Follow them . If they make one suspicious move. kill them . Hai , !

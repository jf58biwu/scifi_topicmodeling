 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . You all right ? Where are we ? [ Kirk ] Do we have a reading on the time zone they 're in ? Sometime before 1 00 B.C. - [ Chuckles ] We 'll have to do better than that . - Before 500 B.C. [ Clamoring ] [ Doug ] We 're right in the middle of no-man 's-land . - They 'll cut us to ribbons . - Let 's get over behind these rocks . 600 B.C. 7 00 . 800 . 1 000 . 1 200 . - Stabilized at 1 200 B.C. - Where ? Space-time coordinates 389-58 . About where Greece and Turkey meet at the Hellespont . Die , Trojan ! [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . Wait ! We 're not Trojans ! Neither are you Greeks . Who are you ? - W-We 're - - We 're from another country , another - We 're visiting cities in the area . Then what are you doing outside the walls ofTroy ? - Ancient Troy . - Yes ! There . We will let Ulysses decide what to do with these strangers . You 're wrong , Ulysses ! We 've fought the Trojans on their terms long enough . Those plains are red with Greek blood . What do you suggest , Sardis ? With a handful of men , I can burn Troy to the ground . Always the same plan , Sardis . And always the same answer - no . We were sent here to rescue Helen . If you set fire to the city , she will die too . And what of the man who stole her from Greece ? Burning him alive is too good a death . - What is it ? - Two prisoners taken on the battlefield . They 're not Greek , and they swear they 're not Trojan . I didn 't know what to do with them . Bring them in . Who are you ? Where do you come from ? We 're from a faraway place and time . A great distance . [ Chuckles ] Let me roast their Trojan heels . - They 're lying . - It 's the truth . Wait , Sardis ! Do you come from west ofTroy ? Yes . - West of the Aegean ? - Yes . - West of Delphi ? - Well , yes . From north of the Pelion , north of Ossa ? Let 's just say we come from a place in time without end ... - past and future . - [ Gasps ] Gods from Olympus ! Just as I thought . ! Welcome . Wine . ! Welcome . Sit down . Sit down . Wine . If you come from that place of time without beginning or end ... then you must know the future . - We do . - Tell me then - How will this war with Troy end ? You 'll be victorious . And what of Helen , our stolen queen ? - You 'll return her to Greece . - [ Ulysses ] And my armies will shatter the walls of Troy ? No , Ulysses . You 'll never breach its walls . This proves they 're Trojan spies ! They 're just trying to confuse and trick you ! It may be that the gods are going to prove that there 's another way to win this war . Ulysses , these are men , not gods ! Don 't listen to them ! What if you are wrong ? What then ? There 's one way to settle this . Let me test them . Very well , Sardis . - Let me do it . - No . He tossed it to me . If I refuse ... he 's won his point , and we 're dead . [ Oscillating ] [ Kirk ] We 're getting an image . - Can you zero in ? - No , there 's too much interference . [ Groans ] Tony , look out ! Wait ! You 've disgraced your sword and offended the gods . - Ulysses , they are not gods ! - You were defeated ! Now I will listen to what they have to say . You 're a fool , Ulysses ! You 've played the fool ever since you started this siege - rejecting my plans , my advice , making one mistake after another . Ten years of military blunders on this forsaken coast . All right , go your way . I 've had enough . Once before , one of my generals went off to sulk-Achilles . Command decisions are not easy . And then again , maybe Sardis was right . Believe me . We are not Trojan spies . Sardis is a man of force . Let me test you with another weapon . Many years ago , when I began to doubt the wisdom of this bloody war ... I sent some questions to the Oracle at Delphi . My messenger returned with some answers . Now if you are indeed who you say you are ... then you must know these answers . You must know them firsthand . So tell me ... did Apollo advise me to continue this siege ? - Yes . - What began this battle ? Paris stole Helen away from Sparta and brought her here to Troy . How did he come to take her ? It began with a contest among the gods and goddesses - - Venus , Juno and - - Minerva . There was a contest of beauty between them . And Jupiter was too wise to act as judge . - Who did ? - Paris . He awarded the prize , a golden apple , to Venus . And as a reward , Venus said she would give him ... the most beautiful mortal in the world - Helen . Do I dare take from Paris what Venus gave him ? Yes , because Minerva and Juno are on your side ... - and other gods as well . - You among them . You take care of our friends , and see that they have the proper attire ... and everything they need for their comfort . Our friends from Olympus . Don 't be a fool , soldier . I am Sardis . I must see Paris . Take me to him . Helen ? Helen ! Helen ! Helen ! You called , Paris ? Did you watch the battle today ? - From the parapet . - I fought very well . - I didn 't notice . - We smashed their attack . - But did you lead it ? - Yes , I led it . I was everywhere , cutting them down , cracking their skulls ... looking for their heroes to give them the edge of my sword . Where were they today ? Where was Ulysses ? I called for them to come out . You must have called very quietly , like a thief . You are a thief , you know , Paris . I am witness to that . We 're back to that , are we ? I stole you from your precious Greeks . I kidnapped you . I took you by force . As I remember it , you were sick of your husband ... and came away with me of your own will . You implored me , begged me . I couldn 't shake you off . Thief and liar . - You deny it ? - I deny that what I did was of my own will . You came with the help of someone or something that worked on my mind ... and destroyed my will , that made me want to come away with you . Was it poison ? You know you used poison on the arrow that killed Achilles . What was it that you used on me ? Only love . Did I ever love you ? Do I love you now ? You 'll learn . If I haven 't learned in 1 0 years , will I ever ? You will as soon as you understand ... that Troy will never fall . IfTroy stands forever , I 'll hate you forever . Sardis ! You ? Without an envoy or a flag of truce ? Why ? - I 've come alone . - With an offer of peace ? No . I 'm here to join you . - Join me ? - You 'd betray Ulysses ? Sparta ? You 'd betray me ? I don 't believe it . Believe it . Helen , Sardis is our guest . He 's your guest . [ Laughs ] Ten years and you still haven 't tamed her . What really brought you here , Sardis ? The rule of war that says one side must win and one must lose . Ulysses will lose , and I don 't intend to lose with him . - Why will he lose ? - Because he 's stubborn . For years , he 's refused to take my advice . Yes , he continues to fight us on the plains where we have the advantage . Worse . And today was the end for me . After the battle , two strangers were brought into the camp . - Ulysses thinks they are gods . - Why ? Because they were strangely dressed . And because they told him what he wanted to hear that a direct attack on Troy cannot succeed . - Which is true . No matter . Ulysses believes this . And he 'll continue to fight in the plains until you bleed his armies to death . Tell me . What kind of gods are these ? They are no more gods than I am . They are men . But it would seem valuable men . Since Ulysses thinks of them as gods ... if they were taken captive , he might take it as an evil omen ... and retreat even sooner . Could they be taken captive , Sardis ? Yes . By me . I know Ulysses 'camp as I know my own hand . But how can I be certain of your loyalty ? Let me prove it . Go with him . And if he betrays us ... kill him with his own sword . I shall need 25 men dressed in Greek uniforms . [ Laughs ] The plains are littered with Greek dead . How will you get there ? We 'll circle their flank and come upon the camp from the sea . Ulysses may think we 're gods , but apparently in ancient Greece ... the gods were drafted into the army . - That 's right . They took sides . - Well , what are we going to do ? As soon as they 're all asleep , we 're going to get out of here . - Doug . - Mm-hmm ? Listen , I want to get out of here as much as you do . But before we go , I 'd like to find out if it really happened that way . - If what really happened what way ? - The Trojan horse . Did Ulysses really use it to trick them ? Tony , maybe it 's legend , maybe it 's not . But remember , despite what Ulysses thinks , we 're not gods . - Let 's just go . - It 'll only take me a minute to talk to him . A minute could mean the difference between life and death . I can be back before you 're ready to go . All right , but don 't let him keep you . - Can it be done , Epeios ? - It can be done , but ought it to be done ? - Now you attend to your work and leave the thinking to me . - Gladly . - But one may not displease the gods . - How can this displease them ? This is a tactic of cunning , a tribute to Minerva . - But we haven 't asked her permission . - Epeios ! You are growing old and cautious . The gods are on the side of those who win . - In fact , two of them have already joined us . - Huh ? - I see that you are already building the wooden horse . - [ Gasps ] - He knows . - He knows . He looks down on all of us from the future . - Ah , then all is well . It can be done . - How soon ? Oh , with a hundred men , two days . Maybe three at the most . Then get to it , Epeios . Then Minerva has approved of my tactic . - It 'll go down in history . - As a great piece of military strategy ? Yes . It 'll become legendary , Ulysses . - Where 's the other one ? - He 's gone . - Where ? - He 's with Ulysses . Create a diversion . Set fire to the camp . [ Clamoring ] Here is one of Ulysses ' gods . - And the other one ? - He was with Ulysses . - Who are you ? - You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . You 're addressing a prince ofTroy ! I hear you brought Ulysses some interesting news . We spoke of many things . - OfTroy ? - Yes . And its fate ? Is it true that Ulysses will never breach our walls ? - It is . - How can you know this ? He claims to know the future . Let 's test him on the past ... on something he couldn 't possibly know ... unless - I make no claim to come from Olympus . I have a sister , Cassandra . Is there anything special about her ? She is said to be very beautiful . I mean something else . She has something that ordinary mortals don 't have . Yes . She has a gift from Apollo , the gift of prophecy . Did she foretell anything about the fate ofTroy ? When you brought Helen here 1 0 years ago ... Cassandra foretold that Troy would be burned to the ground . And is her prophecy true ? It was . But Troy still stands . The prophecy is false . And so are you ! The prophecy is true . Ulysses would never leave without me . He knew about Cassandra . To kill one god is to offend them all . I say he is no god . Take him away . Give him freedom of the house . But watch him . You may go . So you believe he is a god too ? He did know of Cassandra 's prophecy . - But said nothing of mine . - Yours ? Yes . That if you follow my plan of battle tomorrow ... we will destroy half Ulysses ' army . I know Ulysses ' mind , how it works . An attack at dawn tomorrow , if made as I advise , will cost him his best men . We 've searched the entire camp . He 's gone . I don 't understand . Why would they take Doug ? How could they have known we were here ? Sardis , he 's also gone . I 've seen his betrayal coming for a long time . His humiliation yesterday drove him into the Trojan camp . I 've got to get into Troy to find Doug . - You can 't do it alone . - I 've got to ! - Then fight with us ! - [ Fanfare ] [ Marching Soldiers Approaching ] They 're coming out of the city . The elite guard . The best Paris has . I 'll have a few surprises for them ... especially if Paris takes Sardis 's advice . When they get close , give the orders to fall back . Fall back . When they 're cut off by the fire , attack . Keep falling back . Fire the straw ! The fire ! Now ! Someone had better fire the straw or else all will be lost ! I 'll do it . [ Ray ] There 's Tony . He 's being attacked . ! Where 's Doug ? I don 't see Doug . If we can 't bring them back , maybe we can help another way . - Jiggs ! - Yes , sir ? Jiggs , get a bag of grenades and a submachine gun . - We 're gonna try to send them back to Tony . - Yes , sir . On the double . [ Screams ] - Get them in the Tunnel . - Yes , sir . Ann , get ready to send them out . Activate the Tunnel ! We didn 't move them . The radiation bath could detonate those grenades . - I 'll get ' em . - No . Wait , Jiggs ! Where 's Jiggs , the grenades ? Transmitted . To the plains ofTroy . [ Men Screaming ] Jiggs - There 's Jiggs ! We 're still locked on him . We can get him back . - Do we have enough power ? - Yes . Activate power ! - Where 's Jiggs ? - Well , the retrieve should have brought him back . The probe reading indicates that he must be in the Tunnel . Could we have lost him too ? Maybe we never picked him up . Activate the image area . We must have picked him up . Deactivate the image area . He has to be in the Tunnel . Why ? Because the instruments say so ? The Tunnel goes to infinity , sir . Dr. Swain 's right . Jiggs could be in there somewhere , but still not visible to us . I 'm interested in a flesh-and-blood man , not a man in infinity . What do we have to do to get him back , all the way back ? I suggest repeating the retrieve procedure as though we were still locked on him . - I agree . - All right . Do it . Stand by to retrieve . Same coordinates . - Ready ? - Ready . Activate ! - What 's the matter ? Why isn 't it clear ? - I don 't know . [ Jiggs ] General Kirk . Can you see me ? Jiggs ! Jiggs , is that you ? Can you hear me ? Yes , General . Yes , General . Come out ! Come out of the Tunnel . I 'm trying . It 's hard . I don 't know if I can make it . I 'm trying . ! It 's so far ! It seems so far ! I don 't know if I can make it . TryJiggs . Keep trying . What have we done to him ? Jiggs , don 't move . What 's the answer ? Jiggs , I want you to go back into the Tunnel to the transmission point . Yes , sir . Yes , sir . Now . Yes . Yes , sir . Same coordinates . Reverse polarity . - Ready . - Activate ! - Jiggs ! - I 'm all right , sir . - I 'm all right . - [ Explosion ] - What 's going on ? - I must have left the retractor on automatic . Jiggs , keep him in there ! Get ready to send him back . Guards ! No ! Don 't shoot . Don 't kill him . Can you send him back ? As soon as we synchronize the time differentials . [ Jiggs ] All right now . Force ! Force him back ! Force him back into the Tunnel . - Are you ready ? - Ready . Activate the Tunnel . Activate . Any second now . [ Jiggs ] All right . Come on , men . Come on back . A sword . From the siege of Troy . Positive proof that the siege ofTroy is not a myth . Ulysses , Helen , Paris ... Achilles - They really did live . Not did live , General . They 're living now ... somewhere at the end of the Tunnel . Well done . You fought well . So did all your men . The enemy runs now ... but their courage will return , and so will they . We must hold them today ... for the wooden horse is promised for tonight . It will hold two dozen men in its belly . More than enough once it 's inside the city to open the gates to us . - Ah . If it is taken inside . - It will be . Ah , but most cunning is where I have hidden the secret door . - Here . - C - Come , old man . [ Chuckles ] There 's no secrets from him . - Is the horse finished ? - All I have to do is put the wheels to the platform . - Then get to it . - Yes ! Well , I suppose you already know my plan . Yes . Tonight you will send your soldiers back to the ships ... as though you were starting to abandon the siege to go home . And leave the wooden horse in front of the city gates . A gift to Minerva , a tribute to the defenders ofTroy . Gods not only read the future , but also the thoughts in the minds of men . There 's one thought not yet in your mind which I 'd like to put there . I would like to be among those who enter Troy inside the wooden horse . To see to the safety of the one with whom you came . It 'll be so arranged . - Good night , Ulysses . - Good night . You sent for me ? Something 's happening . Something strange and frightening . There are rumors that Ulysses is retreating , going home . Well , that 's impossible . He won 't leave without you . So you 've heard ? Ulysses is retreating to the sea , and Troy still stands . Well , god from Olympus , where are your prophecies now ? I 'll show him . Come . There . Your thousand ships returning to Greece . Now you are Helen ofTroy . Take the god to the dungeon . Put him on the rack . Paris , let him live ! Let him live ? My dear , he 's a false god . You predicted victory for Ulysses ... but you brought him defeat . I 'll tell you this . You will die on the sword of Ulysses . And Troy will be in ashes . So my sister Cassandra said . But not one person in all ofTroy believes her . Not even the priests of the gods . There 's one thing you don 't know , Paris - Is that when Apollo gave your sister the gift of prophecy ... he made one condition . What condition ? That no one would believe her . Take him away ! Tonight all Troy celebrates our great victory ... and our new queen . I will never be queen ofTroy . You 'll be what I tell you to be . - Do you understand ? Do you ? - [ Footsteps Approaching ] - What is it ? - There 's something outside the city gates . - Something wonderful . ! - Well , speak . A great wooden horse . A gift left by the Greeks . A tribute to the victors . It 's only fitting . Sardis , we 've won . Now it 's beyond all doubt . Well , what 's the matter , Sardis ? Ulysses is not one to offer tribute except to the victors . - Well ? - I fear the Greeks , even when offering gifts . After 1 0 years of holding them off ... should I fear them now ? No , we Trojans are not afraid of wooden horses . Have the gift brought into the city so that all may see it . [ Drums ] [ Cheering ] Destroy it , Paris . If Ulysses sends it , there 's danger . You Greeks and your superstitions . You amuse me . Does it frighten you too , my dear ? If it does , I 'll put it to the torch . Deprive yourself of such a magnificent monument to Trojan victory ? No , Paris , you 're much too vain for that . [ Chuckles ] Now you 're beginning to talk like a wife . The Greeks ! The Greeks are in the city ! Where is my friend ? Tell me or I 'll kill you . - Tell me ! - In the dungeon . Beneath the palace . [ Clamoring ] What 's happening ? - What 's happening ? - The Greeks . They 're pouring into the city . How ? How did they get past the walls ? Beware of Greek gifts . The horse ! That 's right , Paris . A horse . [ Helen ] Oh , Ulysses . ! He said you 'll die on the sword of Ulysses . Fight , Paris . I have no desire to butcher you . [ Strains ] Ulysses , let me live . Please . Please let me live ! You stole our queen and offended our gods . No , please ! Helen , you 're safe at last . Ulysses , I never lost faith . I am grateful . Oh , Ulysses , the one who was captured from your camp - - He is on the rack in the dungeon . - I 'll send help to him . [ Creaking ] Doug ! Cut the rock ! [ Straining ] - What kept you ? - The Trojan Army . Remember that horse we were talking about ? I see you have found your friend . And you found your queen . Your predictions have all come true . Paris died at the hands of Ulysses ... and Troy is in flames . - We have them again . - Refine the focus . Tell us more of the future . What will happen to Greece ? The ways of the gods are strange indeed . Civil War uniforms . This doesn 't look like southern or eastern United States . Some of the battles were fought in the West . Well , there 's one way to find out . " " Private August Schmidt . " Enlisted St. Louis , Missouri , 1 868 . That 's just after the Civil War . Ah , 1 868 , right in the middle of nowhere . - They must be the same ones who got those soldiers . - Yeah . [ Bird Call ] Maybe we gave ' em the slip . Come on . We better keep moving .

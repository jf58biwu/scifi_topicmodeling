 You 'll have to wait a minute . - Where is my advertisement ? - What advertisement ? The one that should be in the case outside . Where is it ? Who 's it for ? My professional services . Oh , so you 're the famous Professor Monserrat . - Where is the advertisement ? - Took it down . It didn 't seem to interest the public like some of the others . 'Nobody 's paid for the last couple of weeks . ' That 's five bob owing . How can I conduct my practice without advertising , tell me . Like I said , that 's five bob 's owing . There . - Okay , grandpa , back it goes . - Thank you . You 'd like to go over the spadework on a little dolly I 've got lined up tonight , eh , grandpa ? Estelle . You 're late for lunch , Marcus . I 'm sorry , dear . I got in to an argument with that tobacconist fellow 'about the notice . ' Oh , bother , I forgot to pay him . Oh , I took care of it . - ' Ready to eat now ? ' - Hmm . Any patients while I was out ? Only a man with a twitch in his cheek . 'He said he 'd be back later . ' I wonder if he will . - ' What 's that ? ' - No , no , nothing , nothing . Come on , Marcus , lunch is ready . Do you really think it will work , Marcus ? Of course , of course . When will you be ready to try ? Oh , soon , very soon . How soon ? By tomorrow , perhaps . - Tomorrow ? - Why not ? All I have to do is to check the equipment once more . Then , we can test it ? And then , we can test it . I 'm here to serve . As long as it doesn 't make you feel inferior . Alright , sir . The man 's learning respect . It 's all those years pulling coal carts down the mines . Shut up , you two . Michael , come on and dance , yes ? Michael , come on and dance , no . Come on , Mike , let Nicole have some fun for once . For once ? Four nights in a week , I find myself down here in this den of iniquity . It 's only for the purpose of giving her a good time - Alright , if you won 't , I will . Come on , Nicole . - Alright . - Sure , sure . Seduced and abandoned , that 's me ! You poor misunderstood lad ! # I know a girl what you gotta do # # Hey hey girl # I think that you matter it 's a matter of time # # I 'm telling you # I feel the same and everything will work out fine # # I intend to make you mine # I 'll wait until the end of time .. # - ' Yes . ' - ' It 's ready . ' - When can we test it ? - Now , tonight . If only - Yes , Marcus , but who can we use ? - It must be a stranger . - Yes . Someone who doesn 't know us . A complete stranger . Who need never know what has happened to him . Precisely , but .. ... but he must be someone who 's mind is pliable . Someone who is basically willing . How can we find someone without explaining to him first ? A drunk , perhaps . Oh , no . A mind confused by alcohol . It must be alert , able to respond . Someone young . A boy who 's bored , out looking for something . How could we find him ? Oh , all these children out on the streets at night taking pills to keep themselves awake . Yes , looking for new experiences . Exactly . You could persuade one of them . Offering something new , exciting . He 'd fall for it , of course . Of course , then we begin up here , in that room . He 'd know nothing about it afterwards . It 's perfect , Estelle . And no one will laugh this time . There will be nothing to laugh at . Nothing at all . - Had fun ? - She 's a lovely girl . How long do you think all this can last ? - Girls ? - Fuck you , man . I mean the trouble they come wrapped up in . I like the dress . I think it 's funny . You 've been brainwashed by that boss of yours . Ringo 's a very nice man and he 's been very good to me . If I hadn 't met him , I 'd worry about that . - Let 's get out of here . - Where do you want to go ? I don 't where . Doesn 't matter . Anywhere . Come on . I have a feeling it 's going to be one of those days . Are you mumbling about something ? Not me , bwana . - Where 's Nicole ? - Still titivating . - She 's what ? - In the ladies . Combing her toe nails or something . I spent half of my life waiting for her . Why ? Not worth waiting for , eh ? - That depends . - On what ? State of her toe nails . Where do you think you 're going ? For a walk . Where else ? What about taking Nicole to dinner ? You 've just landed yourself a job , mate . She 's your girlfriend , not mine . Don 't worry , I 'll pay you back . That 's not the point , Mike . You asked her out , not me . The point is I 'm bored , blue , black and bloody indigo with wandering about from club to club with no more idea to where I 'm going than a blind camel in Oxford Circus , okay ? That 's why I 'm going for a walk , on my own , by myself . Got it ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You wouldn 't . We 'll see you at the club later then ? Bloody artistic temperament . - Yes ? - Give us a Wimpy , please . You 're looking very bored , young man . Are you talking to me ? As a matter of fact I am . I 've been watching you this evening . Are you from the FBI or something ? No . I wonder if I might join you ? Seems you just did . Perhaps , I can offer you some coffee . No , thanks . I don 't drink . Yes . What is it you do want ? I could offer you an unusual evening . I doubt it . Some extraordinary experiences . What are you selling ? Blue movies ? Nothing as dull as that . Cheap hash ? It 's not worth the trouble , mate . This would be worth the trouble . Oh , come now , there 's nothing you really have to do . 'Is there ? ' Okay . Lead me to it . - So , you found someone , Marcus ? - Well , yes . Who is this , sir ? This is my wife Estella . My assistant for good many years . Good on you . Perhaps , I should introduce myself . I 'm Professor Marcus Monserrat . You 've heard of me ? Not that I recall . Oh , come on , come on . Where are all these multicolored miracles of yours ? He 's impatient , Estelle . - You 're wasting my time . - Don 't go . Well , let 's get off with it then , whatever it is . That 's right . In here . Go on . In that room . You 're kidding ? For 40 years , I 've been acclaimed as one of the world 's greatest hypnotist . Bully for you , mate . 'No , not on the stage . Not a cheap theatrical act . ' A medical hypnotist . A practitioner . Marcus .. 'And during those years , I 've refined , enriched my powers-' 'Now , Marcus , that 's enough . ' If you two wanna start an argument . I don 't mind , really . Till now with the aid of light and the use of sound I brought them to a pitch never dreamed of in the annals of the human mind . Eh ? Come and sit down , young man . - On this thing ? - Yes , sit down . I 'm too young to die . You said you wanted something new something you 've never done before . Yeah , but I didn 't think that .. No harm will come to you . We guarantee it . Sit down while I adjust these . What 's this supposed to do then ? A dazzling , indescribable experiences . Complete abandonment with no thought of remorse . Intoxication with no hangover . Ecstasy with no consequence . Alright then . See what you can come up with . There . Eagle Two to Blue Leader . Relax now . Try to clear your mind . Empty your mind of all thought . Hey , what 's going on ? Everything is alright so far . Get up out of the chair . Go in to the next room . Okay . - Are you coming then ? - Yes , you go on . Close the door . He did it . It 's working , Marcus . Yes , we can control him . Even at a distance through the door . By directing his mind . Oh , we 've done it , Marcus . Keep concentrating . Hold him , hold him . Have him .. ... go in to the kitchen . It 's perfect . Let me try . Keep concentrating . Feel his mind . What shall I have him do ? - Have him pick something up . - Yes . An egg from the fridge . The third from the left . Break the egg ! My hand , Estelle , it 's as though .. I have egg all over my hand . Now , water . Tap water . On mine too . My God , Estelle , we 're feeling all his sensations . Everything he touches , we touch . It is as if .. ... we were him . Let 's send him away and see if it works at a greater distance . I broke one of your eggs . That 's alright . It 's perfectly alright . Now , my boy , I want you to leave here . 'Once outside this house , you will remember nothing 'of what has happened here . ' 'You 'll be perfectly normal . ' 'Except you 'll remember nothing of all this . ' From now on , we are going to control your mind . From time to time , we 'll put thoughts in to your head 'and you will obey those thoughts . ' 'Understand ? ' Now , go , my boy , and remember nothing . Quickly , Estelle , sit here . We can follow his movements for a while . Oh , Marcus , this can be wonderful . Concentrate , concentrate . We still have him . I can feel his footsteps on the pavement . I never dreamed this could happen , even at this distance . To get inside another 's mind so completely to feel transmissions from his very nerve end . What we need is something more positive . Prolonged sensation . Intense heat or the coolness of water . Water . That 's it . Water . I can hear music . Even sound is transmitted . - Hey , Mike . - Hi . - Return of the prodigal . - Had a good time ? - Come on , we 'll sit out . - Suits me , I 'm bushed . Where 'd you been , Michael ? Having an orgy with a hamburger . All this time ? Special economy sized hamburger . Cheers . Ugh ! Horrible stuff . I 'll get some reloads . You pay though . Here you go , Shylock . - Let 's get out of here . - What about Alan ? He 'll have to look after himself for a change . 'Let 's go . I wanna take you some place . ' That sounds very dangerous . Come on . Well , we can 't just leave Alan like that . He 'll be hurt . You didn 't mind leaving me a few minutes ago . - That 's different . - Why ? - You wanted to be on your own . - I never want to be on my own . Come on , let 's go . We 'll leave a note , if you like . Bastard . 'He 's responding perfectly , Marcus . ' 'I know just where to send them . ' - This way , love . - What are we doing here ? - Going for a swim . - Are you crazy . In this cold ? - Uh-uh . Indoor pool . Private . - How do we get in ? I got my own personal " Open sesame . " Come on . Oh . - Where did you think of that ? - I don 't know , just came to me . - Right out from the blue ? - Yeah , Mike Mercury , that 's me . 'Et Voila ! ' 'I 'll go and turn on the pool lights . You go down , alright ? ' - ' Alright . ' - ' Okay . ' It 's transmitting perfectly . I can feel the water all around me . Oh , it 's wonderful . It 's too much . He 's exhausting me . Stop him . No , no , let the boy enjoy himself , Estelle . All we have to do is to stop concentrating and our sensations will get less . We get him back when we want him . Of course , dear . Now , relax , relax , let go . We must keep it secret . The process . Oh , no , it must be used to help people . To help us , Marcus but only if we handle it right . But not just us . Other people as well . Old people like us who don 't have what we have . We haven 't been able to afford anything for years . Not since that reporter with nothing better to do decided to investigate your practice , you know that . Now , why are we so different ? Well , we 're not locked up in some old people 's home . - Don 't you see ? - No , I don 't . Well , they could enjoy the sensations of swimming by proxy of course , just as we did now . Take long , long holidays . How do you propose to do that ? Well , find somebody who 'd set up a foundation and send just one person . A transmitter , so to speak .. ... on a long , long cruise . All these sensations and experiences would be relayed back to the old people left at home . Yes , it sounds wonderful , Marcus . - ' Ah , then you do see . ' - Yes . You must feel proud . These sensations and their control . You 've achieved something remarkable . I 'd almost forgotten the control . But it 's there . That boy , we were making him do things . He was ours . He is still . An enormous extension of hypnotic power I grant you . But we 'd stumbled on something greater by far . I must write up a report . 'If I can convince people that it works 'and try to find someone to finance it . ' 'Make sure it 's put to a good use . ' - Marcus . - ' Yes , dear . ' - The report ? - What about it ? Must we do it yet ? Why not ? What do you mean ? These papers with their scornful stories about your work . Haven 't they wrecked our lives for years ? That 's all over now . 30 years with no money , no reputation and all because of these lies . Don 't we deserve something for all those years , Marcus ? Nobody else . Just you and me . We have the boy now . Let us use him . 'Give ourselves a few things we haven 't had for so long . ' Why not ? Those powers were to be used for other people . Yes , of course .. ... but just for a while . Just for a little while , let us use the boy . Use him for what ? We can choose , Marcus . Alright , Estelle . Just for a little while . We can chose anything . Thanks , Michael . Can I come up ? Why not ? Go and look for Alan , otherwise he 'll go mad . Okay , you 're the boss . For once , I am . Morning . Anything in particular you were after ? Well , I 'm looking for a telephone , as a matter of fact . How 's that ? Well , let 's face it . That 's not gonna do anything for anybody is it ? Got anything else ? No , that 's it . Oh , well , in that case .. ... you 're not much use to me , are you ? It 's so beautiful , Marcus . They 'd have it insured . Well ... all things like that are insured . They wouldn 't suffer in the least of they lost it . If it .. Well , got burnt by fire let say . Now , would they ? Alright , Estelle , just this time . But please ... never again . Michael , is that you ? The geese are flying tonight . 'What 's that ? ' Password love . Now , come on let me in , it 's cold . Okay , come up . I 'm nearly ready . Why do girls always claim to be nearly ready when they 're walking around half naked ? Maybe there 's an answer to that . Could well be . # Gets a bit too much to bear # And you need someone to lean on # # When you look there 's no one there # # You 're gonna find me # Out in the country # Alright , Marcus , let us put ourselves in touch . Concentrate , and we 'll get him . # It belongs to you and I # Come on and join me # Hey out in the country # And a pretty girl has her hand in mine # # In the country # Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba # Mike . Hello . Do what ? Oh , yes , hang on . I 'll fetch him . - Hey , Al . - What ? There 's some French bird on the phone for ya . Thanks , Ron . Oh , I wish I were your age . Hello . Nicole . He stood you up ? Mike ? That 's a bit sudden , isn 't it ? Even for the boy wonder . Sure , sure . I 'll be finished in about ten minutes . Yeah , that 's great , love . Yeah , I 'll see you later then . Bye . Uh , Ron . Alright lad , you can go . Thanks , Ron . Hey . Make sure she 's on the pill . Ha ha ha . You dirty old foreman , Ron . Down the street . To the right . # You keep tearing me apart from morning till night # # And I 'm trying to resist but it just ain 't right # # You make me feel like I 've never felt before # # I 'll tell you now I can 't stand it anymore # # So please give me what I want # # Give me what I want your love # # Please give me what I want give what I want your love # # I realize how much I needed you # # Love is a driving force there 's nothing I can do # No , thanks . # You make me feel like I 've never felt before # # I got your love I can 't resist you anymore # # So please give me what I want # Don 't worry . You know these moods of his as well as I do . Better , in fact . - I 'm sorry , Alan , really . - What for ? You love the idiot not me . I 'm not in love with Mike . He did it , Marcus . Yes , we did it . - You 'll have your fur . - Wonderful , thank you . Better wait a bit before he tried to pick it up . - The fur , yeah . - Well , that 's what you wanted . Yes , then . I didn 't realize . What ? You didn 't realize what ? I didn 't realize it would be like this . I don 't understand . What do you mean ? You do , Marcus . I saw you . 'You enjoyed it , didn 't you ? ' How could 've I enjoyed it ? The policeman coming in . It was dangerous . But that was the most exciting part . I saw your face . You did enjoy it , I know that . - I did too . - It 's wrong , Estelle , wrong . To be human ? We all want to do things deep down inside ourselves . 'Things we can 't allow ourselves to do . ' 'I 'm right , aren 't I ? ' But now ... we have the means to do these things without the fear of the consequences . You 're right , Estelle . I ... I did enjoy it . Who is that ? It 's me , Nicole . What do you want ? Can I come up ? Please . Okay , come up . And I couldn 't remember a bloody thing . It was ... peculiar . I don 't know . Poor Michael . Can you remember walking out on me ? I remember leaving here short , but I don 't know why . I felt I had to ... do something , go somewhere . Do what ? That 's what I can 't work out . But I obviously did it . You can bet your bottom dollar it wasn 't any whist drive . Sorry about ... waking you up , love but I was a bit ... scared , you know . I bet it 's the first time you ever admitted to that . Yeah , maybe it is . Stop brooding over those , Marcus . It 's all the past . I 've just seen a policeman stop a man on a motor bicycle . Why , what was he doing wrong ? - Speeding . - Well ? Have you ever experienced speed ? Oh , once in an ambulance after I cracked up my leg . I mean , real speed . I never have , and it must be magnificent . - Oh , terrifying . - But magnificent . We 'll have it , Marcus . Real speed . When 's your afternoon off , love ? Today . Saturday remember . So it is . That 's two black outs in 24 hours . You should see a doctor . I 'm healthy enough . Lots of green veg . Don 't talk with your mouth full . My mouth , my prerogative . So , you got the afternoon off . Let 's go someplace . Where , movies ? No . The country . Out of the smoke . - How ? - Alan 's got a bike . Would he let you use it ? No . But if I just sort of borrow it for a while . Sounds like your bike , Alan . - Okay , love ? - Okay . Right . Let 's go . The bleeding nerve . Hello , friend of yours ? That 's your word for it . Who was the bird with him ? Same one I took out last night . Oh ! Yeah . Mike , slow down . Michael . Mike , slow down . Stop . What the hell have you been up to ? Taking a spin in the country , okay . No , it 's not okay . Look at Nicole . What 've you done to her ? Don 't let him talk to you like that . Don 't talk to me like that , Alan . What are you doing ? - You lousy bastard . - Get him . Michael . Oh . Ronnie , quickly . Good boy , Mike . Good boy , Mike . That was the best thing we 've had yet , Marcus . I 've never dreamed that you could sink to this . Oh , Marcus , it was beautiful . Incredible . By God , Estelle , you must be out of your mind . The liberation ... never before . Oh . - I 'll stop you , Estelle . - How , Marcus ? Just tell me how ? 'If nothing else , this has proved one thing . ' - What ? - My will 's stronger than yours . You can 't stop me . You tried to then , didn 't you ? I could feel your mind working against mine , but I won . - Didn 't I , Marcus ? - You can 't win all the time . Not when you 're asleep . I 'll bring the boy back here . De-process him , set him free . I 'll never let you do that , Marcus . Never . I 'll go to the police , tell them everything . They 'll laugh at you . I 'm going to stop you , Estelle . I promise you . Argh ! You 'll never , de-process him , Marcus . No . No , Estelle . No . 'No , Estelle , no . ' No , no . There 's no point now , in even getting the boy back , Marcus . I 'll stop you , if it 's the last thing I do . It 's no good , Marcus . You can 't stop me . I 'm sorry . Hello . Hello . Who was it ? I don 't know . Nobody there . Somebody casing the joint , maybe ? I doubt that . Probably Michael wanted to make peace or something . That bastard . What did you see in him , Nicole ? - Honestly ? - I don 't know . Since all that business last night , it seems to have been .. Some kind of trouble . And I wanted to help . But after this .. After this , what ? Nothing . Not again . - Who is it ? - Audrey . It 's me , Mike . - Who ? - Mike Roscoe , love . I don 't deserve that . It 's alright . I haven 't seen you for ages . Why have you come here ? Well , come in . Thank you . I just thought , I 'd pop around and see how you were . - Want a cup of coffee ? - Yeah . Thanks . 'Sugar ? ' No , thanks . I should 've remembered that at least . Mike , why did you come here ? Really , I mean . Is it trouble with , Nicole ? Yeah , sort of . It 's a bit complicated . Tell me . I 'm sorry , Aud . I had to talk to somebody . You can talk to me , can 't you ? Yeah , I guess so . How are you feeling , Marcus ? I 'm sorry , I had to do that . But I couldn 't have you getting out of here just as we were going to have our little ... contest . Now , could I ? 'I seem so hazy . ' Like half the time I don 't know why I 'm doing things . And there are whole periods when .. ... I can 't remember anything at all , nothing . Did you explain to Nicole ? Yeah . What did she say ? 'Did she try and understand ? ' No . No ! Mike ? What did Nichole say ? Mike ? Mike , what 's the matter ? Are you alright ? Stop . Well , Marcus .. ... it 's no good . You can 't hold me back now . Somehow , some way .. ... at any cost , Estelle , at any cost . # Boy you 're coming on strong now # # Turning me on now # I feel kind of groovy # Oh baby you move me # Well you get me to the stage where I feel fine # # And then you tell me that I gotta draw the line # # Oh baby nothing # I said I miss nothing at all # Sweet sweet nothing # Well that 's all ever get from you # # Oh , you excite me # When you touch my hand # So why try to fight me # I just don 't understand # Well you get me to the stage with my feet off the ground # # And then you turn around and say down girl down # Well , well , well . # ... nothing # I said I 'm getting nothing oh no # # Baby nothing # Well that 's all I ever get from you # # Now all the money I get now # # I 'll give it all to you # I even bought your sweater # And your hipsters too # Well you get me to the stage with my feet of the ground # # ... down girl down # Oh baby nothing # Yeah I said I 'm getting nothing oh no # # Baby nothing # ... well that 's all I ever get from you # # Oh baby sweet sweet nothing # Yeah I said I 'm getting nothing # # Ah ha # ... that 's all I ever get from you # # Baby sweet sweet nothing # I suppose that 's for our benefit . Independence , and so on . Well , he 's met that girl before he always said , he couldn 't stand her . You 're the one who 's been saying how strange he 's been recently . Maybe , he 's finally flipped . Well , he certainly hasn 't lost his charm . That 's if he ever had any . Leave him alone , Alan , please . Are you sure you know where we are ? I know where we are . Where , then ? You 'll see . Look , I don 't like this . Don 't be daft . It 's just up there . Come on . I 'm going back . Come on . Why have you brought me here ? - To sing for us . - Us ? Yes , us . That 's why you came , so let 's hear you . But the club . Where ? We 'll go to the club , I 'll sing . Where they got a group , a band - - Sing . - But I can 't . - Not here . Not just like that . - Sing . I wanna hear you again in the right surroundings so come on , sing . Come on , get on with it . Sing . Stay away from her . Stay away . Now . Nothing , nothing you can do at all . And nothing yet can compare with tonight 's achievement . Can I help you ? Cheese or pickles ? Ham , coleslaw ? Something special ? Liver sausage , sauerkraut , and gherkin ? You are not hungry , then ? Want to lose a few inches . I will lose a few shillings . Please don 't . You look okay to me , baby . Yes ? Cheese and pickles ? Ham ? Gherkins ? Sauerkraut ? Liver sausage ? What can I do you for ? Nothing thanks . Excuse me , this place is not a bus shelter you know . 'One espresso , please . ' 'Yes , coming . ' What 's wrong ? - Hey , this is the girl - - Shush . He couldn 't have . Oh , no , not , Mike . He pretty near killed me . Look at this . Another killing as well , last night .. - You can 't think that Alan - - Can 't help what I 'm thinking . Two girls have been killed . One was with him last night and one near his shop . - What can we do ? - Go to the fuzz . - But you 're guessing . - Let 's hope I 'm guessing wrong . We still have to call the cops . Can 't we talk to him first ? I mean , he might have an alibi . - Yeah , yeah , that 's the point . - Please , let 's go see him . Okay . He won 't be at the shop not at this time . - Perhaps in the flat ? - We 'll try there then . Here , you are tuppence short . 'Hey , Marcus ? ' 'You 're happy , Marcus ? ' Marcus , I 'm talking to you . You hear me ? You haven 't eaten it . Eat , Marcus . You have to eat to keep you strong . Go away , Estelle . If you don 't keep strong you won 't be able to have any .. ... any comp-competitions with me . Keep away from me . Damn you , eat . - Wotcha , Fred . - Hello . - How goes it ? - Fine . Is that a late one ? Fairly . I done one in the three o 'clock . Which one was that ? Old Times . Seventh . Give more to your woman , not so much to the bookmaker . Yeah , very funny . Here . This bird that 's got done in I picked up in a cab . Go on , when was this ? Last night from Blazers club with a young fellow . 'I ain 't gonna have my fun without you . ' Damn you . Not when you 're drunk . What do you mean ? My will is stronger , I 've proved it . 'Twice I did . ' Your mind 's a fog . That 's what you think . But you 're wrong . Try the door . Mike ? - Try the bedroom . - yeah . Well , looks like he came back here last night anyway . I wish he was still there , at least we could talk to him . Maybe , he 's at the shop . He loves that place if he 's got nobody to talk to . I suppose so . - Let 's telephone him . - Okay , fine . 'Hello . ' Hello , Mike , this is Alan . Nichole and I wanna talk to you . - At least he 's there . - Yeah . Come on . 'Alright , Marcus . Do you think I can 't still hold him . ' Alright , I 'll show you . If you try anything , Estelle , using that boy .. ... I will prevent you . How will you do that ? In the only way I can . Ha , just you try . Hmm , careless bastard . Nobody here , George . That mean we 're gonna have to check through all this junk . I cannot waste a tip-off , just because the boys not home . Mike , let us in . We wanna talk to you . Michael , unlock the door , please . What do you want anyway ? I thought we weren 't on speaking terms . To hell with that . - It 's about that girl . - What girl ? The one you went out with , the singer . What the hell are you talking about . You were the last girl I went out with , didn 't do me good . - Last night at the club . - Who sang with the group . - Laura . - That slag ? 'You must me joking . I wouldn 't look at her . ' I 'm very busy , I got a lot to do . Would you two love birds leave me alone . - Michele we must talk to you . - Why ? Laura was killed last night . And another girl too . He must work somewhere . Try looking for a letter head something that will give us an idea of where . But that 's not gonna much use , today . Everything 's closed . Well , it 's better than nothing . We 're not gonna get anywhere if we wait looking for blood stains or something damn stupid . Well , that 's true enough . You don 't remember coming to the club then , where were you ? - I don 't know . - You must have some idea . - You shut up here , then ? - Went for a walk - Where to ? - To see a friend . That 's my business . - A girl ? - So what if I did ? - A girl called Audrey Woods . - Yeah , we used to out together . Audrey Woods was killed last night . And you killed her , didn 't you , Mike ? No , I don 't remember . - You don 't remember much . - Some things , yes . Like blackouts when you kill people . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I don 't kill anybody . You were two girls , last night , one you admit to seeing 'the other you remember nothing about . ' Both murdered . If you didn 't do it , who did ? I don 't know , I keep telling you I can 't remember . Do you remember going swimming with me - Yes . - Or being on a motor bike ? - Or fight me in the garage ? - Yes . - Or killing two girls ? - No . Now , get out . Leave me alone . - Come on , Mike , tell the truth . - Get out of here ! Leave me alone , go get out ! They suspect , or they know . Kill . Michael , what 's the matter ? - Kill . - No . Put it down , Mike . Nichole get help , quick . Ah . Run . Hey . You alright , son ? I 'm fine . You 're not hurt ? No , no . Marcus , what are you doing ? Stop , Marcus , stop . Stop . - Oh , no . - Yes . I had to do it , Estelle . - Take ' em home , sergeant . - Yes , sir .

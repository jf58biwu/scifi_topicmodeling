In this world , everything is possible . We want to give him a warm surprise . Beto , please take this stuff with you . The propulsion of this ship will be done with atoms from Sibila planet . The disintegration of these atoms will produce a chain reaction to give the ship a propulsion of twenty thousand miles per hour . twenty thousand , have you said ? Do you think this would fix my blood pressure ? I think so , mister . Welcome aboard our spaceship . What 's wrong with you ? Are you OK ? It 's nothing ... I will be better soon . Is it true that we will travel that fast ? Course , it will be a memorable experience . Did you hear Mom ? 20000 miles per hour ! We can no longer stay here . We arrived on time , right ? Yes , Sir . Hurry up , please . What attraction so fabulous . I think repeating . And I think go with you , boss . Have a sit . Where are you going ? The ship is taking off ! Sit sir ; you may fall . And that would be so unfortunate . So unfortunate ... Please sit ! take positions . 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 1 ... zero ! Dad , we are flying now ! Amazing ! It seems as if we 're traveling across the sky This is very unusual . That thing had never flown away . but , you don 't realize . That is a real flying saucer ! Look professor ! There goes the ship ! Where they go ? The ship is so far from Earth 's orbit . Hey , lady . No plans to offer us some to eat ? I think this trip is taking too much . Mom , I like it very much . I hope to keep control of that ship . For what reason have they been abducted ? I wish I would know ... Marcos ... this is very strange . Yes , very strange . This is becoming a pain . Then , you think like me . Miss ... When will this simulation ends ? It 's time for you to know the true . We 're flying to the planet Sibila . - What are you saying ? - Return to your seat ! I will kill anyone who doesn 't obey . You don 't intimidate me , baby . Put that toy away ! If we die , this spacecraft will drift . This will be your coffin , for all eternity . Go on . What do you expect to shoot ? Just kidding . Please , tell your plans to us . We were ordered to travel to Earth . And capture some of its inhabitants . What for ? You will know when the time comes . You have to answer for this to justice . Which authorities ? Pay attention : We 're going to another planet . How is the spaceship doing , professor ? The news at all on the front page of every newspaper . They report the replacement of the ride at the fair For a real flying saucer ! And that flew into the sky ! It is clear that the beings of an unknown planet have abducted some inhabitants of our planet But the reason remains unknown . I don 't know either . And now , what next ? Nothing , but to wait . Untill we know something about their destination . This has no flavor . At least it seems like feeds us . Mom , I want to go home . And what if we point a gun to his head , and force them to return . You 're stupid . - You and I settle accounts . - Got a problem with me ? - Yes I do . - Think about how to get out of this mess . - Silly thief ! - Mobster ! Hold me ! And I thought that you had changed . Can we change subject ? You had told me that I think of having a home . That 's true . Would you marry me ? Me ? I 'm not crazy enough . Can you think twice ? We go to a planet where the competition will be tough . You will benefit . Do not snore . Here they come . Here they come ! Wake up ! They have arrived to Sibila . What 's Sibila , Professor ? It 's Sibila , the planet of the perpetual shine . - Ok , let 's go over there to meet them . - We have to wait ... Walter 's ship is being prepared but will be ready in several days more . Wow , I just hope we get in time I think we should get some sleep . Wake up . Put this . We 're coming . What 's this for ? Don 't ask . Just do it , please . For you , and for your folks here . - I will not use this . - You have to do it . - Why ? - Because I say so . Okay , if you put it that way ... - Put this on . - Come on , boss . - Ramon ... - What 's that ? I 'm not sure . - So , this is Sibila . - Seems that there 's not much civilization , right ? We are in the nap time , miss . Wow , apparently this planet is very productive . In this world there is always sunlight . You will never see a sunset . You should always keep your helmets on your heads . If you disobey , you 'll go blind in minutes . Follow us , now . Did you hear that ? You can 't actually have a bad night . These are elegant statues . Here are some more . look ! Those are moving . Mom ! I 'm Adastrea , Queen of Sibila . I demand to know the truth about this place . This is the way we rest , here in Sibila . I don 't give a dime about it . What I want to know is : Why have you brought us here ? I thought she had told you . - No . - I 'm so sorry ... No need to get angry . You will be treated as friends . Like good and old friends . You lie ! Why did you do that , Adastrea ? This is Alburnia , my sister . Your criticisms have begun early in the morning , Alburnia . I told you to stop this insanity . - Do you forget that I 'm Queen . - Just because I gave you my place . I beg you to forget this family dispute . It 's amazing that these women want to dominate us . Take control , Boss . I 'll handle this crazy woman . I hope that nobody else wants to test my necroluminic spears . What will happen to him ? How dare you talk that way to the Queen ? Let it be , Martesia . He will calm down soon Please ... What will happen to us ? Soon you find out . I want to talk you , sister . First , you need to accommodate our guests . My sister will escort you to your rooms . Now , you can leave . Out ! Before I lose patience . Soon we will find out . Take him to the lab ! - This is your room . - But we are not ... No . We 'll talk later when the time is right . This will be your room ; What 's your name ? - Silvia . - I hope we become good friends . Come after me . Here is where you spend the night . And this is your room . No , there will be no answers ; at least for now . This place is horrible . At least it is smooth . - What will happen to us ? - I wish I could tell . Pay attention . As you have noticed , you will be under my supervision . Don 't get me wrong . I do this to advance , even to the lesser of your wishes . And to ensure that you 're better served . But I warn you , you have to obey my orders I will be severe with those who do not . I will be aware of everything that happens . Even on your thoughts . From this moment on , you can 't leave your rooms . You can only get out on appeal . When your food is served . - Beto , I want to go home . - I 'm scare . Keep this in mind : you will only be treated friendly , while you behave like friends . Obeying my orders . Otherwise you will be destroyed without mercy . Be careful . Our future depends on this surgery . Man , how can you sleep at a time like this . It 's getting hot . They have left their rooms . This will have consequences . But this is much more interesting . I don 't know what they do there with your friend . - He 's dead . - Yes , I know . We have triumphed , ma 'am . But it is not a definitive solution yet . Do you realize , boss ? - Do you realize that ? - They are butchering Ramon . I think they want to adapt their lungs . Turn them into a kind of adapter . I will not tolerate this . We 're not guinea pigs . Let 's go , boss . immediately ! let 's go ! Let 's go , boss ! Where are you going ? If you follow him , both shall die . Help ! Help me , please ! Can you hear me ? I 'm going blind ! A man just left the palace . Let it be . The sun will punish him . Boss ! I 'm blind ! Everything is dark ! Who 're you ? Where 're you taking me ? Where are we ? Who are you ? I 'm blind ! You asked for it . Take him to the laboratory . Where ? What do you intend to do with me ? My sister must be very busy . Otherwise she would be eating with us . That makes me think that we can speak freely . Then say what happens here . I will ; It will be difficult to find an opportunity like this . Sibila is inhabited by a group of women , without a soul . Governed by Adastrea . You and she are very different . Ours is the first case of twins . We believe that you inherited a goodness she can 't understand . Maybe , but that is irrelevant for now . They have tried to go to Earth . But they have failed . Our lungs are not adapted to the atmosphere of your planet . How come ? Our lungs are not adapted to Earth 's atmosphere . We can hardly live there for one day . That is the reason why you 're here . I understand ; they 're trying to perform a transplant . Yes ; they 've created a device that works with a lung graft . And so they can live on Earth . That 's the experiment carried out with Ramon 's body . And now they are operating the fugitive . - Oh , not Beto ! - Yes . There will be two lung adapters . And soon they will send two women to your planet . - Where are you going ? - I left my kid sleeping ; I fear for him . For the moment , he is safe . You may stay . Otherwise , we call attention . Yes , Rosa , please calm down . Don 't worry . She is my confidence . Tells me that the experiment has ended . My sister will be here soon . Let 's go ; I will escort you to your rooms . There we can talk a bit more . Are you ready ? If you notice something suspicious , please let me know right away . Why are you interested in helping us ? - Lower your voice , they watch us . - Don 't worry , there are no cameras here . We have an old legend ... It says that the twins are , in fact , a single person separated by a deity ... One embodies evil ... I understand ; you represent the other party , goodness . That 's not true . At least I 'm not like her . Alburnia , please help us to escape . I can 't help you . You will need eye protection . Or you would be hopelessly blind . And what if we get some glasses . But you could not drive our ships . I have a plan : my confidant go to Earth to ask for help . In that case , she have to find the professor Daniel Wolf . He 's my boss , and also a scientist . I 've to give you precise instructions . Write this : You 'll need sunglasses to protect you from solar radiation . And weapons for defense . Of what kind ? Nuclear ones ; only thus , you 'll have a chance . Please , do what I just said . Otherwise , you 'll be irretrievably lost . Fitia , my confidant , will contact your friend . And when will that be ? At the Naptime . Find this man , and come back safely ... You must return before Earth 's atmosphere annihilates you . Give him this card with instructions . Explain to him that if fails , everyone will be defenseless . Thank you so much . Good luck . - Why didn 't stop her ? - Her ship was ready . - We were late . - These people sent her to Earth . You must go to Earth to stop her ! Don 't let her to talk to anyone ! You will take the adapters of life we just made . You can have all the time you need . While Fitia will only have a few hours , before her dead . Leave now ! You ! This is your work ! It 's . Fitia has gone to carry out my orders . Why have you betrayed me ? I never fought with you for power . Being heir to power , just like you . I wasn 't interested to be the queen for such a ruthless mob . So , why bother with helping those men . I will not let you be cruel to the innocent . Oh , I will destroy you ! And why haven 't you ? It 's simple . Your life and my life are linked . After my death , you do not live longer . That 's not true ! That 's just a silly legend . But you 're not willing to take any chances , right ? It 's just that I haven 't damaged you because you are sister of mine ! But from today on , you will be monitored . You will never interfere with my plans , again . We 'll find out , soon . Professor Daniel ! She is there ! Look at this ! She brought these instructions . She should be near . - Where 's she ? - Close . She can only endure some more . Your faithful servant , despised but always faithful . I have received your message . I understand that we soon depart . I just need a little time to pack . Can I use your car , professor ? Thanks a lot . I ... had some instructions . Yes . I 'll travel to midnight . I will not make any statements or interviews . Professor ! Something horrible has happened . She 's kinky , professor . That dress looks so weird . Yes , she said something . Then , you talked to her . She was saying something , but she suddenly died . Her words would been very useful . Whatever , we have to report this event , and stay alert . Tomorrow , we 'll be heading for Sibila . She died before delivering her message , ma 'am . There 's something more . Our life device will last just a few days more . The graft is overworked . - It 's possible that ... - I understand . As I imagined . The lungs of adults are very worn . Stay on Earth . Stay tuned for my orders . I see you have lost your appetite . Your company gives us nauseous . Why not decide what to do with us . That was clear , until you reiterated your disobedience . I have nothing to do . He left the room . You don 't have to say a world . I know everything . There 's something you have to know : You shouldn 't trust someone who offers help . Although that person appears to be my sister . She is under surveillance , just like you . - We are here because of you . - And you ought not to follow me . I wanted you to pay for your tricks . Thief who steals from a thief . Are you calling me a thief ? You dirty street fighter . I 'm sorry . The only good thing about this is your downfall . Please Ma 'am , let us leave . Just for the kid . I can 't help you . What I need is the child . Don 't waste your time . He 's already in the lab . Don 't harm him ! My son ! My son ! You can 't be so vile , Adastrea . Move on . My desires are never in question . - It 's done , Ma 'am . - What do we have ? As you assumed . The lungs of children is what we need . It 's logical . They 're new and healthy , with no wear at all . The graft will remain in the incubator . With this , we will live forever on Earth . - How are you ? - Where 's mom ? Go and find her . No need to sacrifice him . We will need many children . Mom ... Mom ... My son ! You 're fine . Thanks to Lord . Are we already there , Professor ? Look ... There 's Sibila . The Planet of hearthless women . All are equal . Do you know a woman with a heart ? - Why do you think so ? - They 've always been cruel to me . That ship ... It 's from Earth ... It 's comming our way ! Alert the guards ! Hey ! Let them land . Let our sun take care of them . They will be blind in minutes . They will be easy to subdue . We will wait for them here . Listen ! Come ! Look ! A spaceship . We have alert 'em . Or they become blind . I have to talk to your Queen . - Leave me alone ! - What 's it , Marcos ? An Earth ship is coming . We must alert them about the sun . Take me to your Queen . We have little time ! - Go back to your rooms . - You have to kill me ! - We will please you . - Please Marcos , they 'll harm you . Your queen will pay for this . I have to see the Queen . but for different reasons . I can be very useful to her . Come with me . This sun is unbearable ! Professor , we can take the visor down . Yes , I guess you 're right . - Speak now . - I want to help you . - Why ? - To save my life . I can prevent you from my colleagues ' plans . Are you interested ? No , I 'm not . I can 't say who came here to rescue us . I 'm worry that , unless we warn of the solar danger , they become blind . Damn sun ! " The Planet of Eternal Day " We will lose a screw here . Something must be done ! Clearly , this sun is brighter than Earth 's . If that is the worst thing to what we face , I see no problem . Hold on . See ... Here we have to face dangerous enemies . We must think clearly every step we take . What 's your idea , professor ? That woman is very cruel . feelings have no place here . She is the most insensitive of all . Be careful , they may be listening . It 's the same . My sister knows my opinion on her . That people should be landed already . If it 's , they 're doomed . Remember , one single mistake and we and we have failed . This sun is unbearable , professor ! Get ready , here they come . Wear this , or the sun will blind you both . Luckily for you , we 've arrived on time . What 's this for . Our sun is too brigth . It can easily blind you . That would be terrible ; having so many beautiful things to behold . Shut up , dude . Obey the lady . Who 're you to talk me that way ? Imbecil . Former lightweight champion . Please forgive me , I had to do that ... he 's acting like a drunk ... And I have bad temper too ... My partner is dangerous because of his fondness for drink . I think you should talk directly with me . What do you do in Sibila ? Well , We thought about doing a kind of business ... Wait ... I guess I think we can be partners in the business . What bussiness ? Your human prisioners ... we had already sold 'em to a foreign government . But this guy talked too much ; he loses control when he drinks . - Then we fled and ... - Explain that to our Queen . Did you see I was right ? Those guys could be allies . - Follow us ! - Ok . I don 't care about your plans . That ship has primitive technology for us . Give it to me so that I return to Earth . I can help you . I 'm sure on that . You can return , and They could take you . But , before that ... I keep my word . Your emissary can stay in my cottage . Leave that ship , it 's dangerous to stay there . Should stay in the summer house of this man . It 's unoccupied , and there will not attract attention . We will , ma 'am . You will wait there ... Until we put an artificial satellite into Earth 's orbit . We fulfill your orders . If all goes well , you 'll be a free man . Make them come here . Go , I don 't want them to see you Yes , my Queen . Explain the situation to me . I 'm Adastrea , Queen of Sibila . Nice to meet you . You 're gorgeous . Don 't you think so ? You are welcome , only if you obey my orders . It is a privilege to admire your beauty . Thank you . You 're gentle , earthling . Come , you will share the table with me . I 'm very tired . - Take him to his room . - Yes , please . These are my guests . But you will be the guest of honor . You move ! He will sit next to me . Imagine no more . Do you know any of these people ? I think not . Probably I wouldn 't remember this people . This is disgusting . Give me something better . I 'm sorry , but you have to get used . There is no alcohol here . Damn planet ! My watch has stopped . What time is it , dude ? 2 : 20 Right Silvia ? Yes , It 's . I hope our clocks go forward at the same time . Yours too , Miss . The three of them . Time has come . If your fat body is interposed between the screen and the door ... if I open the door quickly , may not be captured by signal . Got it ? Look , the only thing I caught is that you go to bed . At that moment I walk through the room and you get out of here . It 's hot ! I hope that ... I hope they have understood my code message ... to meet here at 3 o 'clock . You come from the Earth , like us . And you have to help us . Please explain your words . We are prisoners of that tyrant women . She wants to perform some weird experiments on us . So , you think I ... Earth is precisely where I don 't want to return . Be careful . We are being watched . Prefessor , can you get sun glasses for us . There are some in the lab . See you at 12 : 00 naptime . We get out of here . Understood ? I see . Why don 't you want to return to Earth . I 'm a fugitive . In addition , there is plenty to do here ; is not so ? Yes , it 's . Remember , 12 : 00 o 'clock . Count me out . And if you insist ... I will report you . - You 're a bastard . - I 'm a businessman . Always do what is best for me . Now I 'm sure to trust him . I want him here . What do you see ? An artificial satellite , finding its orbit . Do you know what is this ? The Thunder Mirror . Be used to send its death rays to the satellite . And from there and into the Earth . I don 't follow you . The mirror captures in all its power , a reflection of our sun . And thanks to satellite , rays can reach the Earth ... But magnified . Destroying everything . No , just what I choose . From Sibila , me , the Queen ... send my message . We are at that 's man place . It 's a safe place . The mirror has been graduated already . Only the oldest die , the children will live . You will seize the children . We need twenty of them . The target has been set . The rays are directed toward a school . - Everything must be perfect . - We are ready , ma 'am . Why ? And what matters ? Beautiful stranger . You 're right . Being with you , who cares what happens to the world . We have to stop that monstrous crime . Damn . I forgot that they can hear us . No , this place is safe . We can freely speak . It will be necessary to postpone our flight . - How could we warn them ? - It is impossible , professor . I do not understand how they use innocent children for experimentation . You 're a female assassin , without any moral . Wait , she 's Alburnia , friend of us . Queen 's twin sister . Please forgive me . I have so much anger , I could give check to the queen . I also do my best to prevent it . Marcos have said you 're trustworthy . But then , are Marcos and you friends ? I come here to save ' em . I 'm happy to hear that . I confess that my own first impression of you ... was unfavorable . I understand , I had to act to deceive her . Yo did it very well . She 's fond of you . I know that . We have to warn that the plans have changed . - That 's rigth . - It will be easier for me to communicate . Yes , please . Tell ' em that we have to save the school children . Count on it . - I 'm going with her . - Stay here ! You have to come with us , Alburnia . - Where ? - To your room . We 'll watch you there . I have to talk my sister , first . Those were her orders . You will no longer betray us . Who 're you to talk me so ? Your guard . You come in peace , or should we use force . 12 : 00 O 'clock We must leave . It 's getting hot . Go for the marriage . I go for the gangster . Watch our backs . Wake up ! We 're leaving . Hurry up ! They will bring us the sunscreens . - Where is your gun ? - Here . If necessary , use it at will . These women will do the same with us . Do not worry . You go ahead . - I watch your backs . - Ok . Let 's go ! The satellite will reach orbit on time . Albunia couldn 't tell them . You go to reach them . Back in a moment . Stand firm . The flight was canceled . What happened ? There 're some kids in great danger . We have to try to save them before we leave . - I can help . - And I go with you . My Queen ... Now you must be convinced of my loyalty . The prisoners try to escape ! Stop them ! I still got one . That dwarf is a phoney ! Shut ! The dwarf is a friend of Marcos . The other should be the mastermind of this operation . They will pay for this ! - We 're locked here . - Let me try something . It 's useless . That lock is stronger than steel . They may not go away . Gather them all . We were discovered . We have to escape now . I have a shelter . All are being watched . I could not get them . The dangerous ones have escaped . Go get ' em . I want them death or alive . Come with me . The final hour has come . Yes , my Queen . The satellite has reached its orbit . Send sunlight to it . The satellite will send those to Earth . Watch that graduation is perfect . I want those kids ... alive . ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NUMBER 5 Come with us . What are you waiting for ? I command you . You will save by our side . Hey kids ! Where are you going ? What happened here ! Why is Desinea taking so long ? I go to meet her . She adores me . - Here they come . - Adastrea had to find our refuge . We will deal with them . Follow me . I 'm going to dress in the clothes of my sister . From now on ... I will be the Queen . And I will destroy the mirror . So we may escape . Take her uniform off . Silvia , you have to wear it . - You will help me . - But Alburnia ... No , it 's Ok . You couldn 't do it Bring me the prissioners . This waiting is horrible . They are risking their lives for us . Yes , it 's . But Alburnia is right . You and me we would not look sexy in those dresses . Where are you going ? Do you want those beautiful eyes to go blind ? Nobody moves ! At last , not everything is lost . Are the children in your possession ? We have already reported you that . We 're waiting for the night to departure . Take good care of those kids . That 's very important . I don 't understand . you knew that children were already prisoners . Ma 'am , here are the prisioners . Leave them with me . You can retire . What 's happening here ? You act very weird . Close the door ! We have to destroy the mirror . We have to take care of the children first . The doors will withstand only a few minutes . They will die as victims of their own actions . The mirror is death for adults only . Take good cover ! The traitor has escaped from us ! It was easier than I thought . Not so easy . This game has many turns . But ultimately , the best always wins . What you said , the best always wins . You forget the old legend , sister If I die , you will die with me . No , I don 't believe that . It 's time to find out . Stop there ! Are you afraid ? Stop you there . I kill you , I swear . It 's better this way . I could ... not live ... among you . Do you believe in legends now , Adastrea ? We fulfill her wish ... She will rest in peace on Earth . T H E E N D

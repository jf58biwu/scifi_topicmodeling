 The 487th day of space flight The ' Prometeus ' space ship heading to Alpha Aquarii throttled back to launch a shuttle to the scientific station on the orbit of the planet Solaris . The shuttle was to take off at 12 o 'clock at ship time . Chris Kelvin ! Chris Kelvin ! - Ready to go ? - Ready ! We warned the station you 're coming . The touchdown will be a nick . - Have a nice flight . - And a lucky touchdown . Thanks Here we go . Attention ! Start the countdown . Five , four , three , two , one Go ! - Good luck , Chris ! - Remember us to the guys on the station , see you . SOLARIS Based upon the novel by Stanislav Lem Script : Nicolai Kemarsky Director : Boris Nierenburg Part one Back then it seemed to me I was going to the world I knew and got used to . My best friend Gibaryan was to meet me on Solaris with my other collegues - doctor Snout and doctor Sartorius for a company . We 'd celebrate my visit and our long space watch would begin . The only thing I worried about was the schedule time for radio contact Solaris Station , Call Solaris Station . I 'm Kelvin , I 'm Kelvin Entering the deceleration area . Watch my power field stabilization . I 'm Kelvin . Can you hear me ? It 's Solaris Station . Everything 's OK , we 're controlling you . It 's Solaris Station . Get ready for touchdown . I 'm Kelvin . I 'm Kelvin . Ready for touchdown . It 's Solaris Station . Touchdown complete . You can switch the power off and open the airlock . End of communication . Who controlled the shuttle ? The touchdown was under control of the computer responsible for shuttles launching and touchdown . Where are all the people ? They are aboard the station . Is it you idea of a hearty welcome ? Touchdown succesfully complete . Touchdown control : 0.00 seconds . Stabilization : normal . Microreactor : off . Snout ? Doctor Snout ? I dunno ... I don 't know you ! I don 't ! Are you all right ? So caring , are you ? You 'll take care of me , won 't you ? But why ? I don 't know you , I don 't . What is that gibberish about ? What do you want ? Where 's Gibaryan ? You ... .. you 've come to visit Gibaryan ? Not me ? Gibaryan ? Where 's he ? Don 't you know that ? God , Snout ! Come to your senses ! How I 'm supposed to know that , I 'm right from the shuttle ! From the shuttle ? And where did you come from ? From Earth . Does it ring a bell ? From Earth ? So , you are ... you are ... Kelvin ? My name brings it home at last ! What are you staring at ? What 's queer about me ? No , no , no ... it 's nothing ... I just ... I ... I was just taken afright . I didn 't expect you to come . Didn 't you , Snout ? You were to get the notice of my visit long ago . Before I left ' Prometeus ' . the radio operators were to confirm it again . Even the computer knew about the flight . Is it your usual way of welcoming the newcomers ? You 're right , it all went an awkward way around . We 've got a bit of a mess here on the station . I can see that . I can see that . It 's hard to miss . Chris Kelvin . Are you tired then ? Want to take a bath ? Or are you hungry ? Want a snack ? Or a drink ? No , I don 't . I 'm OK , Snout . Where 's Gibaryan ? Look ... The point is ... Well , I 'm to be your only company for a while . But don 't trust your first impression . On a whole , I 'm a good guy , nice to have fun with . Where 's the station commander professor Gibaryan ? You shall learn it soon . I 'm terribly sorry ... I 'm terribly sorry , Kelvin , to have welcomed you that way , but you see .. It is not ... it was not just my fault . Loads of things happened here , that 's why I 've completely forgotten you 're coming . Well , it 's OK , it 's OK , Snout , take it easy . Still , what happened to Gibaryan ? Where 's he ? Did he leave ? No , he didn 't . He didn 't leave and he never will . Because he ... He what ? What do you mean ? Was there an incident ? Kind of ... Was that an accident ? When ? Yesterday . In the morning . - Who is it ? - Wait ? Look ... There were three of us ... including Gibaryan . I mean , humans . Now you make three again . Do you know doctor Sartorius ? The way I know you . I 've seen his picture . I guess , you 'll recognize him . He is in his lab at the moment . Now , look ... If you ... if you meet someone ... Get it ? Someone but Sartorius and me ... - Then what ? - Don 't do anything ! Who can I meet here , a ghost ? Do you think , I 'm mad ? Not yet . I just can 't explain you everything . Not now . Perhaps , nothing will happen . But I warn you to be on the safe side . Warn against what , Snout ? Don 't go wild , control yourself . Watch out for everything . It is the only thing we can do under the circumstances . What do you mean , Snout ? What shall I see ? I got no idea . It depends on you . Do you mean psychosis ? Hallucinations ? No , they 're real . So , watch out for everything . I warn you . Real ? Living creatures ? I don 't understand , Snout . You 'll do , you 'll do , later . Well , OK , but you haven 't still told me what happened to Gibaryan . Where did you find him ? In the wadrobe . Was he dead ? His heart was still beating ... - Did you try to save him ? - We were late . In the wadrobe ? ! - Why ? - I got no idea . He stood there between the overalls . I 've compiled a preliminary protocol . Cause of death : a lethal dose of Pernosthal . A suicide ... What reasons could he have ? Nervous breakdown , depression . You 're a better expert than me . I know just one thing for sure : Gibaryan took in the lethal dose of Pernosthal and then hid himself in a wadrobe . He got neither nervous breakdown nor depression . He got brain-waves , kind of paranoia ... But what could frighten him to death ? And why didn 't Sartorius sign the protocol ? He doesn 't show up . He keeps his labs . Have you come to see him ? He has locked the door . Has locked the door ? And built some barricades , didn 't he ? Probably so . Have you all gone bananas , Snout ? I wish we were that lucky . If Gibaryan had thought he was mental , he wouldn 't have commited suicide . He would have lived . So , the protocol conclusion about the nervous breakdown is a fake , isn 't it ? Sure , it is . - Why didn 't you write down the truth ? - What did I have to write about ? Stop wriggling , Snout . You 've already messed everything up . Tell me the truth . I take it , you won 't ? I can 't . Honestly , I can 't tell it . I 'm going to Sartorius ' lab . Will you stay put here ? Watch out . Remember , you 've got to control yourself . Snout 's talking , these footfalls ... Everything was complicated and hard to understand . I tried to comfort myself . The station was high over the planet , hermetically sealed and armoured . Who could penetrate inside ? I didn 't want to surrender to my fears , but I was helpless about it . Doctor Sartorius ! It 's Kelvin . I 'm a new employee , I have to see you . Doctor Sartorius ! It 's Kelvin , 'Prometeus ' brought me 2 hours ago . There 's nobody here , I 'm alone . Open the door ! Doctor Sartorius ! I know you 're over there ! Open the door ! Damn it , I 'll count to ten and then just break in ! One , two ... No , no , I 'll open the door if you promise to stay out . - Why do you need to open it at all then ? - I 'll go out to you . OK , I promise . What do you want ? How do you do ? My name is Kelvin . You have to have heard about me . Gibaryan is ... was my collegue . - But I 've learnt that he died . - He did . Who was the first to find him , you or Snout ? Why do you ask me about it ? Didn 't doctor Snout tell you everything ? I 'd like to hear your version of this story . Do you have something else to tell me ? - Are you a scientist , doctor Kelvin ? - I am . I was almost sure you 're a cop from the way you interrupt an important experiment in my lab , threaten to break the door if you aren 't let in and interrogate me about my collegue . Yes , I do suspect you , and you know very well , why If you don 't apologize right now , I 'll file a complain as soon as we 'll communicate with Earth . Is it me , who must apologize ? ! The one is boozed , the other is all secrets ... A nice hearty welcome , indeed . I see , you 're having great time here . Scientists as you may think yourselves to be ... Please ! Go away ! I 'll come to see you later ... I 'll do everything you want . Just go ! Hurry up ! Well , how did it go on ? Have you met him ? He 's not alone . So , he got " visitors " . Snout , tell me what it is ! I 'm to learn it myself sooner or later . Why are you fooling me and concealing everything ? You 'll perceive the truth , when they come to you . WHO ? Who will come ? I don 't know . I 'm so tired today . We 're all tired . Come , have a rest . Your cabin is ready . Harrie ? ! I must be still dreaming if you 're here . I 'm still dreaming . NOOOO ! No ! It can 't be ! You 're ... you 've been ... 10 years since ... What can 't be , honey ? What are you doing here ? I don 't know . For how long are you here ? I don 't know . Is it important ? Where have you come from ? How did you know where I am ? I don 't know . I 've just come , that 's all . Are you pleased ? But you ... Harrie , you ... You mean this ? Looks like an injection mark . I don 't remember . You don 't remember , do you ? She doesn 't remember ! But it was the mark of the lethal injection , that killed Harrie ... I buried her on the Earth 10 years ago . So , who was that next to me ? I didn 't understand who it was , but I was sure : this creature could not be Harrie ! It was a replicant , a fake . Her look , her voice , her intonations , even her age were like when she died 19 years old . It hurt insufferably to look at her though I couldn 't help looking . I was looking and thinking , what this creature knew about herself , me and our relations in the past . Was there anything at all it could knew ? Where are your things ? My things ? I don 't know . Have you got nothing more but this dress ? I don 't know . May be , my things are in the wadrobe . There are just overall there . Chris , you know ... I 've got a feeling like something happened . Like I 've forgotten something . Forgotten a lot of things . I can remember you and me . Nothing else . Tell me , had I got an amnesia ? Yes , you may put it this way . - So that is why I can remember nothing , can 't I ? - Probably . What are our relations now ? Good or bad ? They are just great ! If you talk like this everything is bad , isn 't it ? Come , come ! What the ideas ! Harrie , pour me a drink , please . I have to be off , Harrie . You wait me here , ok ? - Are you hungry ? Shall I bring you something to eat ? - No , I don 't need anything . - How long will it take you ? - Not too long . About an hour , I guess . No ! I 'll come with you ! You can 't , Harrie . - I 've got things to do . You 'll stay here . - No ! Why not ? I don 't know . I just can 't . Why can 't you ? I don 't know . I can 't . I got a feeling ... as if I must be with you all the time , see ? All the time ? It 's ridiculous . Want a drink ? I 'll bring you one . I 'll put some ice in it . First thing , I was afraid she would be reluctant to drink , or that the sleeping pills wouldn 't work . I badly wanted just one hour off to recover and to talk to Snout . I had to get rid of her by any means I got at hand . Are you cross with me ? Would you like to rest a little ? - Yes , I would . - Come , lie down . Do you remember ? I do . It 's our song . Let me go ! Let me go ! Now ! - What are you laughing at ? - I don 't know . I 'm a bit loony , am I not ? Your look back then was so gloomy and full of concern like that of an astronaut before the start . - How do you call me ? - An astronaut . You gave me a great idea . Harrie , I 've got to go . Come with me if you want to . Wow ! We 'll go together ! Yeah , but you 've got to put on a pilot 's overall . We 'll go by shuttle . By shuttle ? You and me ! So cool ! Help me . Now , do ! Have this . How do you like it ? Come on . Come on . Is shuttle ready to take off ? Ready . Microreactor charge : 100 % Control system diagnostics ... Successfully complete . Oxigene level ... Climatic facility ... Normal . Switch the shuttle control to remote mode . Well ? Have had a talk ? You 've been visited , haven 't you ? Right . A quick riddance that was . Kind of ... You don 't fuss around ! One , two , go ! Shuttle .. ignition ... and 'see you later , alligator ' . I guess , we 'll have 2 or 3 hours for ourselves . Now , tell me evertything . Are you cross with me ? Would you believe me had I told you everything from the beginning ? Answer , would you ? Forget it . Let 's discuss it thouroughly . Go on with the story . It happened to Gibaryan first . He locked himself up in his cabin and talked from behind the door . Well , we thought , he had gone mad , crying voices , breaking things , demanding us to keep out . He wanted us to give him the chance to ... sort it out in a way . He was a genuine scientist . He experimented , he wanted to learn the issue . And what about you ? We ... We were waiting . 5 days later we decided to break in . We wanted to help him . And then he ... he didn 't want you to see his visitor .. Right , at this very moment . Now you see . Everyone 's got one 's own haunt . No one wants other people to witness . The thing he didn 't knew was that we had also been visited by that time had had our own guests . He thought he was the only person to suffer this . So he hurried a bit . And we didn 't know much back then . But what 's use of our knowledge ? Hard to say what would you 've done , had I not warned you . You see , I didn 't know who would come . It 's impossible to predict . But I told you to be ready for everything . Look , if you 've experienced this before , tell me ... She ... the creature in the shuttle ... What will happen to her ? Do you wonder if she comes back ? She will and she won 't . Don 't speak in riddles ! We must be frank with each other . Obviously you 've missed the clue what is happening here . I 'll explain . Can you tell me , who it was ? My wife . We , me and her ... She killed herself . Made a lethal injection in her arm . Suicide ? Yes . Is that all ? No , that is not all . Tell me the whole truth . All right . We had got a fight . I called her nasty things . She drove me half-mad , I was wild ... I took all my things and left . She said , she would commit suicide . But I didn 't belive her , of course . I thought , she would be too scared to do that . She couldn 't stand the sight of blood . Then I remembered , that I left my poisons in the case . I had brought them home from the lab for some tests . First , I wanted to come back but then it occured to me she would consider it as my weakness . I came back in two days . And I saw her dead . She lay in a fetal position ... Her face was calm and peaceful , as if she was dreaming . That is the end of the story . She wrote a letter to me . I 've had it with me for 10 years . This is the only thing left from her . My sympathies . It 's hard to consider oneself a reluctant murderer . But this is not the most terrible thing . What happened was terrible by itself , But what DIDN 'T happen is more dreadful . I mean , never-happened-things . I don 't understand . A man is considered normal if he did no evil . Can we be sure , he has never thought evil ? Well , not him , but his subconsciousness ? He forgot it in a moment as he knew he would never do it . And then just think ... think of facing THIS ... Something born from those evil thoughts , their flesh and blood , chained to you . - Immortal . - What the damn is it ? It is what we 've been waiting for for so long . An alien contact . Arranged this way ... Do you think it 's the Solaris plasma ocean ? What does it want ? I know just one thing . First visitors came in 7-8 days following our gamma-rays experiment . We sent the the thickest radioactive beem into the Solaris plasma ... Obviously , this was Ocean 's answer . I guess , it explored our minds and revealed various fragments of our unconscious memories or psychic . Psychic ? Fragments ? Exactly . Some dark memories , dim recollections we did our best to forget , block out . Ocean downloaded them , replicated , played back and began to send its creatures here . How did they get in ? The station is hermetic and has its own protective field . Haven 't got the slightest idea . More often they come when we awake from our dreams . But we can 't go without any sleep at all . Tell me , Snout , these visitors ... can they be killed ? We can be killed , they cannot . Damn . What kind of creatures are them ? Subjectively , they 're human . But they don 't know and understand where they came from . In other aspects their behaviour mirrors our expectations about them . What about Sartorius ? What about him ? Sartorius tried hard to stay normal . For him it means to be prim . Once we ran into trouble , there were 8 of us and only emergency supply of oxigen left . Many people panicked , and he shaved himself and cleaned his shoes everyday . Imagine that , he kind of cheered others up by his habits . What shall you do ? I 'll be straight - I 've got no idea . I 'm tired as hell of everything . Sometimes I 'm about to crack up and sometimes I think I end like Gibaryan . I guess we should destroy the station . We should blow it up and take shuttles to Earth and send mayday . Back on Earth they 'll probably think we 're all mad , such things happened before on other stations . And then they 'll lock us up in a funny farm . Probably this is the best way out . Peace . Silence . White p . So , our issue should be thoroughly discussed . On the one hand we achieved the goal people had striven for . We contacted the alien form of life . On the other hand we are the objects of a misterious experiment we haven 't agreed to , we 're violated . Let 's discuss this aspect of the issue , collegues . We should stop the violence against the representatives of Earth . It 's an awkward position for the mankind . What is your proposal , doc ? We should temporarily stop the station function until the living conditons turns back to normal . Do you mean until the contact with Ocean is over ? I meant , " until the living conditons turns back to normal " . You see , Chris , our wishes doesn 't matter , but our options still does . Do you want to flee ? I see , you 're the bravest of us all , aren 't you ? I 'd look at you had you spent here all the time like we have . But the visitors are our only contact with Ocean ! And you want to cut it ! I presume , we 'll learn nothing of Ocean , but it will learn a lot about us ! Exactly ! Our dark past , all human vices , our terrible shame . Stop it . I don 't think Ocean 's intentions are bad . I believe , it hardly worries about this aspect of the experiment . It 's beyond its scope . Probably , you 're right . But I don 't agree to be a test animal ! It 's humilating ! What 's humilating ? Recall how many great scientists experimented over themselves . They risked their lives and nobody thought oneself a test animal . Don 't forget , it is not we who control the experiment ! What if these creatures will become aggressive soon ? Mind it , we can 't kill them , they can kill us . We cannot use our shuttles every time . At this rate we 'll soon run short of them . Ok , what if we can change the situation ? Find way to understand the structure of these creatures ? Find the way to get rid of visitors any moment we want to ? Should we suffer this nightmare every day , every hour until then ? Colleague Snout 's right . Exactly my thoughts . I can hardly persuade you . I don 't know who your visitors are . Snout told everyone 's got one 's own haunt and I can hardly judge you . But trust me , when the person long dead , who died by your fault comes , it is not that easy . But we shouldn 't look for easy ways . When we go to the space , we 're prepared for everything : for solitude , death , for struggle and pain . It turned out , it 's not enough . We aren 't prepared enough . We forgot , we can run into something strange , mysterious , inexplainable among the stars . We forgot , the space is not a galaxy large Earth . It 's a brand new world . It 's the completely foreign level . The foreign world is before us . And we must discover its secrets . A lot of time , expenses , victims may be needed for that . But if we refuse to research this new world we 'll never again be scientists . As far as I get you , doctor Kelvin , you ask us to stay , don 't you ? I 'm not sure ... not sure ... May be , like Gibaryan ... He locked himself up . That 's why he cracked up . But now there are three of us ! And we 're aware of what we 'll meet . One more thing . If we walk away and flee , the station will be left behind . They 'll send other scientists who 'll have to study the issue . And all that just because we didn 't stand it and fled ! Looks like we shift our responsibility to others . Formally speaking , you 're right , collegue . - Of course , I am . - I have other things to say , though . Suppose , you 're right . Are you sure we 'll succeed if we stay ? This is the only way . Under the normal circunstances I 'd consider you offer unaccaptable . But considering the specific nature of the cituation in question I 'll make an exception . I agree to stay , doctor Kelvin . Let 's toast three new victims of science ! Cheers , collegues . We 're meeting tomorrow to compare our surveillance and change the results . What about guests ? Have you forgotten them ? We 've got an intercom , call if anything happens . - Ok , see you in the morning . - Good night . Chris , is it you ? Where have you been ? I 've been waiting for you ! Oh , my God , what 's with you ? I burnt my hand a bit . How ? There were troubles with the shuttle launch . Sometimes you behave like a little boy ! Why didn 't you close the exhaust ports ? I forgot . I was in a hurry . Chris , come on , I 'll take care of you . Lie down . Where 's your burn oilment ? Oh , here it is ! Well , OK , some swabs will do as well ... I still can remember her fingers ' touch . It seemed to make me see my lost Harrie in this creature , believe in miracle . It was a real miracle . Her fingers , eyes , hair , smell were brought back by my memories . My long grieving and my love called her to life . It was a bliss to have her around . Is it OK ? Does it hurt ? You were too careless . It 's a sheer luck your hair wasn 't scorched bald . Do you recall a dude we once met ... the funny , tall and bespectacled one ? What was the place ? Have you forgotten ? Forgotten our park ? Forgotten our time there ? I didn 't . You 're lucky then , or I woudn 't forgive you for ages on . Do you recall also the words you said back then ? Let me see ... ' honey ' or ' babe ' ? You forgot . You said back then , " Damn these gnats ! " You don 't say so . Chris , oh , Chris ... I wish you always remained the same ... It was the happiest evening in my life ! Only one ? I am happy now , when you 're so gentle and kind . And then your ill temper will be back and you 'll start picking at me , quarelling with me ... Tell me , why does it have to happen ? We 've got such a great time together . I woke up that morning with the long forgotten feeling of BLISS . I was happy and a bit sad , my heart was light . Suddenly , I realized , that Harrie was the reason ! She will stay with me forever ! MY HARRIE ! Get up , lazy bones ! Do you know what the time it is ? I don 't want to know . Wow ! Who 's to get up , then ? You are . And don 't forget to bring me a cup of coffee to bed . Do you call it fair ? It 's for you . Get up . - Hello ! - Hello , how are you ? You ... You 've got a visitor , haven 't you ? Yeah . - Are you busy ? - Yes . Sartorius suggests we should meet . Is he ... alone ? I put it wrong ... He 'd like to talk to us . I can switch on the video conference mode . - Is it a go ? - OK . - In an hour then , OK ? - Done . How are you ? I 'm fine . And you ? I thought it would be worse . I was sure about it . Would you like to call in ? Drop it ! Stop , I told you ! Stop ! No , I can 't come for the moment . Perhaps , later . Who called ? Doctor Snout . He 's a xenobiologist and a cybernetist . Do you know him ? No , I don 't ... What visitor did he talk about ? It 's an inside joke . I see . Where are my things ? I cut my dress yesterday , as I couldn 't unzip it . I 'm sorry . I forgot to put your things in places . That memory of yours ! You can 't imagine ... what kind of MEMORY I 've got . Is it over ? Are you bored ? Not yet . What can one do with my blood tests for so long ? Just a little bit . Let me finish . We haven 't got too much fun aboard the station . So , if you feel like seeking ... seeking for other company besides myself , you 'll be bad . How are the tests ? what 's wrong with my blood ? Nothing . You blood is as good as it can be . Chris , you 've got an incoming call . Thank you . Turn on the second monitor for the conference . Greetings for you , doctor Kelvin . How do you do , doctor ? I 'd like to share my thoughts about the ' Phantoms ' . Let 's term them Ph-things for short . Accepted . Then I presume you should introduce us into the results of your research and then I 'll inform you about my own experiments . Would you start , doctor Kelvin ? Me ? All right . Though I managed to do only a couple of tests , I 've got an impression ... To cut it short , I think she is a very good replicant . And she 's much better than the original . We thoroughly know the human body anatomy , but in this case we should percieve the matter much wider beyond the atomic structure . I can 't quite grasp you point . The human body consists of atoms ... I guess the ultimate basic elements of the Ph-things are particles which are much smaller than atoms . - Do you mean mesons ? - No , I don 't . Otherwise I could have detected the mesons . I guess , these are neutrinos . It 's impossible ! The neutrinos structures are volatile . Right , but they can be stabilized by some power field . I 'm not a physicist to further speculate on the issue . Cells and their cores it 's just a camouflage . Their bodies anatomy is much more complicated . Doctor Sartorius , I think this theory may be true . Yeah ... it 's interesting . The field source can be hidden deep in Ocean . We should contemplate this . It 's also important to learn what the Ph-things really are . To my opinion , this is the materialized information our brain stores about the object . Yes , Snout and me have decided this already . There 's only one thing uncertain : why do they come back ? If Ocean experiments with us , it must have aborted the procedure after the elimination of the first visitors , or tried to protect them in a way . Right , but , perhaps , it 's an automated cycle on . Let 's come back to our main issue . I presume , some points by doctor Kelvin are true . I mean his neutrino bodies theory . If so , we must find the way to destroy the power field that makes the neutrino structures stable . I think ... Go away ! Leave me alone ! So , have we discussed everything ? Yes . Snout ... Call in as far as you can . I 'll come when I can . Go away ! Go away ! Harrie , I told you to go away ! Everything 's a lie ! Go away , now ! Go away ! My love , I can 't go on like that . I know , you 're good and kind , but you 're killing me . I can 't live like that any more . neither can I live without you . So , I 've decided to do the only thing left to me . Kiss you for the last time . Yours , Harrie . You shouldn 't pretend . Go away . Don 't torture me , go away ! Go away ! I know who you really are . Go away . What are you talking about ? ! Go away . Harrie , Calm down , honey . - Come , come , my girl . - Don 't call me ' my girl ' ! Calm down , come on ! What happened ? - I 've heard everything ! You don 't love me ! - What have you heard ? I was dreaming , Harrie ! No ! You called me a liar . You told me to go away ! But I can 't go away ! Is it my fault that I 've got too much up to you ? Honey , I 'm so sorry for this stupid dream ! One can dream all kinds of things . No ! You don 't really love me . First , I seemed to doubt it ... but then I understood . Your attitudes have changed . You don 't take me for serious , you have your own secrets . And in your dream you told me to go away ! But why ? ! What have I done ? ! Look , Harrie , I 'll tell you the truth . Honestly ? Yes , I give you my word on it . You ... shouldn 't worry . It 's a good thing you can 't live a single minute away from me , Harrie ! I can 't live without you , either . It 's great , Harrie ! No , Chris ! Something is wrong with me ! I can feel it . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . I forgot the most ordinary things . Why ? Am I ill ? I close my eyes and very queer thoughts occur to me . As if not mine . - Where do they come from ? - What thoughts ? Hard to explain ... They are from far , far away ... As if not mine at all . I can 't explain it . You don 't have to . Don 't explain anything , Harrie . Enough stupid talks . Try to sleep a bit , Harrie . Now , sleep ... - Chris ! - What ? I love you so much ! What the sound is it ? A shuttle took off . ' Hello , mate ! Meet my wife . Here 's doctor Snout . And here 's my beautiful wife Harrie . I ... haven 't got any idea ... Excuse me , I ... Kelvin , can I share a word with you ? Honey , Doctor and I will be in my study discussing our work . What happened ? I got divorced . Sent her away on shuttle . Yesterday seemed to last for a couple of years . How are you ? Great . If you put it that way ... Having fun together ? Kelvin , what are you going to do ? The thing we agreed upon . I 'm now developing the neutrino systems theory . All right . Look ... Sartorius got an idea . He wants to transmit our thoughts to Ocean . Get it ? How ? - Via telegraph ? - Stupid joke . He wants one of us to record one 's brain neurons potentials and to send the record to the ocean by means of a hard radiation beam . It will be some sort of ... an X-ray discourse about the inhuman experiments , won 't it ? - Do you like the idea ? - And do you ? I 've got the plan of my own . But we 'll have to re-engineer some of our machines ... We 'll create an anti-neutrino field . I 've built up a computer model . We 've got enough resources . Wait , wait , how will it work ? The ordinary substance will remain untouched , while the Ph-things ' neutrino structures will be destroyed . Do you see now ? I see . Ph-things will be destroyed . - So , are you in ? - Not quite . Don 't hurry , we must give it another thought . Please , you can smoke . I was lost . On one hand I had to be with my friends . But on the other I could lose Harrie forever , if the experiment succeded . I couldn 't let it happen . I was afraid I would lose Harrie , so I made up my mind to play for some time . Snout ! Are you sure your project is safe for the station ? - My calculation says so . - Yours ... But there can be other results ... Your device may well blow the station up when activated . You should double check you calculations . Naturally , it 'll take up some time , but ... to turn into the star dust is the last thing we want . Meanwhile , we can go in for Sartorius ' project . Let 's try to send our record to the ocean . It can listen to us . Do you believe it ? It doesn 't matter , it 'll do no harm , anyway . All right , I 'm in . I have to go and work while I 've still got my time . Are you absolutely sure you 've done no miscalculations ? Could be so , that 's why I 'd like to double check everything . I 'll be in my lab . Call me on emergency , - Chris ! - Yes , honey ? Who 's that man ? It 's doctor Snout , I told you . Why do you ask ? He gave me a queer look . He just liked you . He didn 't . He gave me such a foul look . Don 't talk rubbish , Harrie . He just got it around him . No . He didn 't even say good bye to me . I just couldn 't make myself shake hands with her . And she didn 't fail to notice that ! How 's doctor Kelvin ? He 's fine for the moment . But I don 't think he 'll stand it for long . What do you mean ? .. Mind and emotions do not always get on well together . But he knows very well she 's inhuman . It was Kelvin who discovered their bodies anatomy . And he was the first to propose the elimination of the power field . I bet , he 's very sorry about it right now . Are you sure ? Doctor Kelvin is a bit emotional , but he 's got a scientist 's mind as well . You see , Sartorius , he 's got the hardest challenge of us all . While we 're more or less determined about our visitors , Chris feels guilty of the wife 's death . And now he has to murder her again . This is the hardest thing about it . But it 's not his wife . It 's a P-thing , a replicant . For us , not for Chris . He got the hard time . I can understand him . But he has approved the experiment . Now he shall do anything to play for time . You do understand , it 's impossible to blow up the station . We must go to him and explain everything . We 've already gone down that path with Gibaryan . Do you recall how everything turned out ? We should try another approach with Chris . I seem to have an idea . We must talk to Harrie straight from the shoulder . Kelvin , I 'm leaving my surveillance reports about the Ocean 's creature to you . I 'll hide them at your apartment because I 'm afraid it can erase them . Perhaps , you 'll find these reports useful later on . Your friend , Gibaryan . What is on there ? You 've messed all your things up ! Have you ever tried to put everything in place ? Isn 't it your job after all ? It 's not funny . - Chris ! - What ? Tell me , is Gibaryan a friend of yours ? He 's thin and dark-haired , isn 't he ? He 's also here , in the station , isn 't he ? No , he 's dead . Why on earth have you mentioned him ? Oh , it 's nothing ... Just a twist of my memory ... Chris . What ? How 're you ? I 'm all right . - I 'd like to talk to you . - You 're welcome . Not like that ... I 've got my work to do , you see . Give me just 5 minutes . OK , honey , I 'm all ears . - But don 't lie me ! - Why on earth should I ? Don 't know , perhaps , you 've got your own reason . I don 't know a lot of things and I forgot a lot . I 've found my letter in your papers , but I can 't remember to have written it . It 's a very queer letter . You were ill . Probably . But still , it 's queer all the same . OK , it doesn 't matter ... I 'd like to ask you a question , but answer honestly , will you ? I can 't remember how I arrived here . Do you know that ? Wait , you may not know the answer . But if you know and can 't tell me right now , promise to do it later . What do you mean , Harrie ? Chris , whatever I might be ... just tell me . I 'll understand . I 've got no secrets . You do known well ... Harrie , you do know , I love you ! Love me ? I 'd prefer being hated . Chris , you have no idea about the way these circumstances depress me . My dear friend Chris , I doubt if you find me still alive ... If you don 't this record will be my farewell letter to you . Now I can say this for sure : You were my best friend ever . Though , we didn 't see much of each other after Harrie 's death you will remain my best friend . I guess , we haunt ourselves . Ocean uses an amplyfied mode of our thinking . It 's stupid and useless to look for any motives of its act , so , we should either stop thinking , or destroy our thoughts materiazation , that is , we should destroy the ocean 's offsprings to go on with our researches . The first alternative is practically impossible , while the second one is very close to murder ... Harrie ! Harrie ! What ? Did you fail ? Why ? Why do you look at me like that ? Harrie . It 's not me you love . You love the girl from Earth . That part of my life died with her . Now I love you . You 're kind . You did your best . But even you can 't help about it . When I appeared here , I knew nothing , understood nothing , but then I started thinking about you and me , hearing your talks with Snout over . I found the postcard . And today , after I listened to the Gibaryan 's record , I understood everything ! Everything ! I 'm not human ! Harrie , you 're a living human . Chris , please , tell my everything you know . I know nothing ... I just ... You 're the precious thing I 've got in this world . I love you . I don 't know , what awaits us , we 're helpless here , but please , Harrie , let 's be together forever . One more thing ... Do ... do I look pretty much like her ? You did before , but now I don 't know ... You mean ? You 're bigger than her . And one more thing ... If you were her , I wouldn 't have been able to love you . Why ? Because I did something terrible back there on Earth ... - To her ? - Yes . Don 't tell me . Why ? I want you to know ... I am not her , I 'm different . She knows everything about herself . Yesterday she wanted to commit cuicide . Why do you tell me this ? I just want you to know where we are . I expected something of this kind to happen . I 've said already that the new comer is , in a way , void of everything ... except the chaotic collection of memories from his or her past life . The more the visitor stays with you , the more human qualities she or he acquires . That 's why the longer they stay the harder they are to get on with . - So , she knows everything , doesn 't she ? - Yes , she does . Every single thing ? And about her previous stay and how you ... NO ! What 's your plan ? - Do you plan to leave the station ? - Yes , I do . - With her ? - Yes . I won 't interfere . I just tell you that you ... try to act like a human under inhuman circumstances . Perhaps , it 's a heroic act , but also a pointless one . Yet , heroic is not a word , for there 's nothing heroic in cowardice , but it doesn 't matter ... I take it , you 've given up our experiment , haven 't you ? You want to leave and take her with you , don 't you ? Exactly . But it will be an experiment all the same ? Have you thought about it ? She will be safe with me . It seems to me , you 're just scared and have made up you mind to flee . We 're all in one boat . Sartorious and me realize it , though . - ... and we don 't play noble . - I don 't play noble , Snout ! OK , I take my words back . But again : you 're a coward to flee from the station . You delude her and more - you delude yourself . Do you know the conditions crucial for Ph-things life ? No , I don 't . Neither do you . Nobody knows , come to that . You 're wrong . Sartorius knows . He explained the principle to me . They can live on constant flow of energy . The energy builds up the stabilization field . But the field source location is a problem . It 's either in the visitor 's body or out there , in the ocean . Do you see the difference ? If the source is external , then ... when away from Solaris the system became volatile ... If you doubt , it 's easy to proove . The shuttle you 've launched , is still in the orbit . We can go there and see what happened to the passenger . You 're crazy ! Or we could bring the shuttle here by remote control . OK , let 's call her by radio . If she survived , she 'll answer . Snout , Snout . Kelvin , Kelvin . Think , what are you going to do ? Who do you want to save and make happy ? Is it you ? Or her ? Which one of hers ? This or that one ? I repeat once more - it 's beyond any moral . What should I do ? Kill her ? The other she will appear tomorrow . Is that one to be killed as well ? And thus on every day to come ? Why ? Why should I , or you , or Sartorius ? Snout , does she bother you both ? Answer me first ! Let 's assume , you two will take a shuttle and fly away from the planet , and in several minutes you 'll see ... Come on , what is it I will see ? God , Devil , who ? The agony . What will you do , then ? Will you come back for the back-up ? - Stop it ! - Shall I ? ! I 'm sick with talking . I can 't see what bothers you so much ? That killing her is a mean thing to do ? What if this is the ONLY way out ? I love her . Who ? Your memories ? No , her ... Her . I hate discussing your privacy , but you were the first to start it ... You love her , she loves you , you 'd die for her , so would she ... It 's great and noble but the problem is there 's no place for such stuff HERE . We are into the things we can 't control . This is a closed cycle , she 's just a tiny part of . Put on a scientist 's hat ! What do you want me to do , Snout ? Do you want me to kill her ? I asked you why and got no answer . Do you see , why you 're here ? You can 't make up your mind and that 's why you fight with me , but in fact , you fight with yourself . No , I don 't . I 've come to tell you that we 're leaving the station . Good afternoon , Snout . Hello , Kelvin . Are you ready , Snout ? Take your seat here , it won 't take long . Don 't worry , I 'll wait . Come on . Listen to me , doctor Kelvin . I 'll give you no orders for they are useless . You should stop thinking about yourself , me , Snout ... And about ... other people . Concentrate on the following point : planets Earth and Solaris . The efforts people have undertaken to find alien civilizations . The hardworking and persistent character of people . Our peaceful intentions . The contact with Solaris . If you can 't concentrate from the start , Snout will repeat the recording session . We 've got plenty of time . Everythig 's ready ! Fine ! Well , shall we start , then ? While I was listening to Sartorius it occured to me that I might try and ask Ocean to free Snout and Sartorius of their phantoms . Then they wouldn 't press it so hard on me to kill Harrie . Then we 'd be able to stay aboard the station and live as before . I began to repeat the line : " Take away the visitors of Snout and Sartorius " " Let only Harrie stay , let Harrie stay ... " I 'd like to talk to you . What about ? About Chris , you ... But let this talk be our secret ! I don 't know . We do everything together ... I can 't without him . I see ... We can have a talk in your cabin , when he 's asleep . Do it for Chris ' sake . So , what do you say ? All right . Though I hoped Ocean would understand me , considering the ease it had accessed our memories with , I was afraid , the giant , mystic monster like it was wouldn 't understand my fear to lose Harrie . At the moment I strongly believed Ocean would fulfill my plea . That 's why I kept on repeating : " Leave Harrie alone ! Do Harrie no harm " . Kill the transmission . We 've sent enough messages . Have we succeded , doctor Kelvin ? What 's your opinion ? We have . - Are you so sure ? - I am . - Will you tell us what you and Ocean chattered about ? - Forget it . Have you started mounting the field destroying device ? Why ? I 've checked . Sartorius was right . It 's safe for the station . I see what you mean ... You sure read and believed in Koe 's theory , but ... Chris , have you changed your mind ? No . At the X time we 'll leave the station for a couple of days . I 'll take the surveillance capsule . You want to save you phantom , don 't you ? Yes , I do . So , when are you leaving ? Tommorow . Come on . Come on . We 'll switch the device on tonight . Harrie ! Remind me to take an extra oxygen reserve less some emergency turns up . OK . We 'll be back in a week . By the time the starship " Prometeus " that brought me here will come . We 'll go to Earth by it . To Earth ? Aren 't you happy ? Doesn 't the station bore you ? As does this black , gloomy , shoreless Ocean ? Have you forgotten how beautiful Earth is ? I haven 't . I remember everything . I 'm often imagining the blue sky , the trees ... The smell of grass and flowers , the water-lilies in the pond . - And clouds ? - Clouds ? Let 's avoid large cities when we 're back . I 'll ask for a country house . We 'll plant a garden there . There will be flowers and berries ... Chris , no berries . Let 's have a soft velvet lawn and a little glass and plastic swimming pool . - Please , there can 't be any garden without berries , Harrie ! - We 'll buy them from the farmers . - Just one little cabbage patch ! - No patches ! - One patch is a must-have ! - No ! Earth ... We 're looking forward to see it when back from the stars , but soon get used to its beauty again . We 're quick at at . Even love can become a mere habit . Imagine , how dreadful such love can be ! The only thing I know is that we aren 't that kind of people . God , it 's so late ! There will be a hard day tomorrow , we 're to get up early . Go to bed , Chris , I 'll wake you up . I 've heard , you and Chris are leaving the station , aren 't you ? Yes , we are . Is Earth your next destination ? Yes . It 's impossible . Why ? Only humans can come to the Earth . The first serious test will interrupt your voyage . But the point is different . How exactly ? Your existance is connected with the flow of energy , controlled by Ocean . The moment you leave the station you 'll die . Thank you for the warning . We 'll stay here . This is not an alternative either . Ocean can stop its experiment ... at any moment . And then you will ... Disappear ? - All of a sudden like I came ? - Yes . - Does Chris know about it ? - He does . Poor Chris ... It 's so terrible to love and wait for the grievious moment to come . It 's not you he loves , but his memories about the long gone Harrie from Earth . It 's not true ! I am his memories ! He loves me ! Me alone ! Look , Harrie , it 's a dreadful thing to say . but your life is to end whatever comes . If you go and die , Chris will accuse himself of your death . Do you want him to ? I don 't . Staying aboard the station is no alternative either . If Ocean saves you ... imagine , what life will you doom Chris for ? The moment he realizes , he 'll be the eternal captive here , he will curse both the station and you for your fault . Chris is the son of Earth and he will long to come back for all his life . Trust me , Harrie ! He loves you now , but the things to come may easily destroy this love . What shall I do ? I know , you 've already tried to put an end to the lies ... I can hardly give you an advice , but Sartorius and me can help you . - You ? - Yes . We 've tuned the device . It will be like a gust of wind . - When ? - Right now . What if Chris wakes up ? Give him some sleeping pills . Make your choice now , Harrie ! You 're the clue . I have to consider it over . I 'd like to do it myself ... Give me some more time ! Just a half of an hour ! I want to stay with him a bit more . I 'll be waiting for you upstairs . - Are you here ? - Yes . It seems to me you were out . - Some voices in the corridor ... - It 's just your imagination . Chris , I 'm thirsty . There 's a glass of wine over there on the table . Will you bring it to me , my love ? On my way . - Would you like to have some ? - No . To me . Well , I 'll drink to you , kid . Chris ... Would you ... get married again , but for me ? I wouldn 't - Never ever ? - Never . Why ? Well ... I 've been alone for 10 years , and still haven 't married . Let 's skip it . And if I asked you ? Asked me to marry ? What rubbish ! I want only you , Put it another way . I love you . Are you all right , Harrie ? What 's up ? Nothing . ' Everything 's OK . Harrie ! Harrie ! Harrie ! Kelvin ... It was you ! It was you ! You talked to her this night ! You told her to give me the sleeping pills , so that I wouldn 't interfere ! What did ... What did ... you do to her , Snout ? ! - Come on ! - Calm down , Kelvin ! My love ! I asked them to do it myself . I 'm sorry , I had to cheat you . But it was the only thing to do . Please , don 't do yourself any harm . You were a great husband ... Harrie ... kind ... gentle ... What on earth is going on ? ! How did it happen ? Calm down , Kelvin . I 'd better postpone my story . I am calm . I 'm calm . Tell me ! I pressed the button , then came the flash of light and in a second she was no more . The flash of light ? It seems to me ... she 'll be back . She shall come back . - She won 't . - Why not ? She 'll be back . She must be back . No . Kelvin . We sent your messages to Ocean yesterday . There have been no visitors since then . No visitors ? - Since then ? - No . Has she left any message to me ? No , nothing . Kelvin . Kelvin , man yourself . Yeah , you 're right . I 'm OK . You all are so good ... so kind ... But why did you do this ? Why , Snout ? What has she done to you ? Has she been so great a bother ? What did you tell her ? The truth . We must report the events that took place here . We have to clean the station , to make up a working schedule . I want to stay . So does Snout . Do you join ? What about me ? What it was I wanted ? To come back to Earth ? What for ? I 've got neither home nor family . Still , I decided to come back . We all return to Earth from the stars . Or shall I stay here with Snout ? We don 't know for sure if the ocean gave up the idea of the contact with humans . It did have it 's own goal . Did it succeed or not ? Will it repeat the experiment ? No , I can 't fly away and leave it behind . I 'll stay on Solaris ! What for ? Do I hope for Harrie to come back ? There 's no such hope any more . But I 'm waiting . What else will the alien mind show us ? I 've got no idea ... But the only thing I know is : there 're more cruel miracles to happen .

 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . Over there , Capitan . Over there ! - How many dead ? - We have killed 1 2 , Capitan . That is example enough . The rest of them will run to the hills . We will go back to camp . He didn 't even try to fight them . He was terrified . I 'd say from the way he 's dressed , we 're somewhere in South or Central America . And that crossbow makes it about the 1 6th century . The others look Spanish . [ Horse Whinnies ] They 're Spanish , all right . Tony , if that 's Cortes and his army ... we 're right in the middle of one of the biggest bloodbaths in history . They came to loot and to kill anybody who got in their way . Well , that may be , but they 're the only chance we have of getting out of here . I must warn you now , Chief . She will suffer great pain unless you tell us what we want to know . Kill them ! Capitan Alvarado . - Who are these men ? - I don 't know , Capitan General Cortes . Hernando Cortes . You are too impatient , Capitan . You should have offered the hospitality of our camp ... - to the governor 's spies . - We 're not spies for anybody . I think they should have the opportunity to witness our efficiency . At least give us a chance to explain our presence here . I will be glad to listen to the fiction ... Governor Velasquez has created to deceive me . But first there is more important business to be taken care of . Take them away . - What have they told you ? - I threatened the old woman , but they would not speak . You are so ungallant , Capitan . But then you lack refinements . You must remember the men are as hard as iron . But it is not so with the women . Torch . I want the golden mask your tribe possesses , woman . And I mean to have it . As a symbol of authority , it will make my task easier . If you tell me where it is ... you , your husband and your son will be allowed to join your people in the hills ... unharmed . Very well . - [ Chief Screaming ] - [ Screaming ] [ Continues Screaming ] [ Sobbing ] I take it you are ready to reveal the location now . - Put down the directions she gives you , Capitan . - Yes , Capitan General . Now , are you ready to tell the truth about yourselves ? We 're here by accident , General Cortes . You come from out of nowhere ... dressed in strange clothes ... in a part of the world inhabited only by natives , and you call that an accident ? - Yes . - It 's no use . He won 't believe us . You are quite right . I know the truth . I have the information , Capitan General . Very well . - You will spare the boy for the time being . - Now wait a minute . You gave your word . You said you 'd spare all three of them . A promise to an Indian means nothing . You are a butcher , aren 't you ? You will have a chance to judge that for yourself . If you are cooperative , perhaps I will grant you a merciful death . Capitan . How long will it take you to reach the location of the cave ? A day , perhaps a little more ... - depending upon the accuracy of the old woman 's directions . - Uh-huh . We 've got to make a try before Cortes can kill them . - Have you got a time fix yet ? - Well , I 'm narrowing it . As near as I can tell , it 's about the first of October there ... in the year 1 51 9 . - What about the place ? - Nothing on that one yet . I might have something on that . This just came out of the computer . Cortes landed here in Yucatan ... March of 1 51 9 . And later he moved his force up to this point ... where he founded Veracruz . Now the Indians are the Tlaxcalans . They met him in his push from the coast . Well , then Veracruz is our area . That isn 't going to do us much good . Doug and Tony are back four centuries . Well , maybe some of the landmarks may be the same . We 'll have to get someone who knows the Veracruz area . Ann , contact the Mexican embassy and let them know what we 're up against . Yes , sir . Now all we can do is hope that Tony and Doug ... can find some way to stay alive until we can fix on them . Who is this Governor Velasquez he keeps talking about ? I don 't know . Untie him . Bring him along . [ Water Splashing ] You will tell me which of these ships brought you here ... and which of my capitans chose to betray me by bringing spies . We weren 't brought here by your fleet , General . And we 've never heard of Governor Velasquez . The august governor of Cuba would be very pleased at your performance , senor ... but it is wasted on me . I give you one last chance . Point out the ship . I told you . We didn 't come here on your ships . We 're scientists . We 're not spies . I will have the truth out of you ! A message from Capitan Gomez , sir . - Did he halt the armies as directed ? - He has . He reports there is dissension among the men . He 's afraid they will try to take the ships to go back to Cuba . That temptation will be eliminated tonight . One more step , and I 'll kill him . Let this be a lesson to you , Capitan . Never underestimate the enemy . Just what use do you intend to make of your advantage , senor ? Just this , General . You will order your men to release my friend and the Indian boy . You overprice your bargain . The Indian is necessary to my plans . Give the order , General . Very well . You will put him back on the tree , Capitan . I will execute both of them in front of the armies tomorrow . It is time the troops had a lesson in royal justice to temper their mutinous spirits . Take him . I will leave a garrison at the bay ... and I will proceed with the armies ... on the road toward Tenochtitlan by this route . You will take 2 4 hours to secure the golden mask . Then you will follow . - We will meet here . - Yes , Capitan General . These natives are a superstitious lot . With the symbol ofTlaxcalan authority in our possession ... the rest of the tribes will yield to us . Then they have a simple choice - to become our slaves or to be killed . I will not fail you . I only wish the rest of my command were as reliable as you , Capitan . It is time to give the signal . Light the torch . If I remember my history right ... he 's going to burn his ships to keep his men from turning back . Look . There is no escape from our destiny now , Capitan . We will succeed in the conquest of this country . They will call the burning of the fleet a marvelous display of confidence . There will be no more talk of rebellion now . True . The burning of the ships is example enough . Now I will attend to the spies , Capitan General . Stop where you are , Cortes , or I 'll blow this camp to kingdom come . Capitan , you will show them that Spaniards are not afraid to die . [ Doug ] Consider what you 're doing , Captain . If Cortes dies , that army out there will fall apart . Those men will turn into rabble . You display a certain ingenuity , senor . Put down the torch . I will permit you and your friend to join my forces . No . Tony , get them out of here . Take one of those kegs as insurance . No . I do not think you would be willing to sacrifice yourself ... just to carry out the orders of Governor Velasquez . Whatever I do , I do on my own . Captain , you tell your men to drop their weapons where they stand . Surely you do not hope to take all of us prisoner . Give the order ! Do as he says . Now back away from them . If you are not a spy , senor , what do you hope to gain by this ? You won 't understand this , Cortes ... but I can 't just sit back and watch one of the worst butchers in history go to work . Butcher ? You call me butcher ? You will be responsible for the pillage of this country . Thousands of civilized Indians you call savages ... will die because of you . Ah , you are naive . If I were to leave this country , do you not suppose ... there would be a thousand other men following in my footsteps ? - This is destiny . - I can 't argue about that . And I can 't fight your army . But I can stop you now . I don 't know what this symbol of authority is that you 're looking for , but you won 't find it . You and your friend and the young chief intend to stop us ? - Just the three of you ? - Just three of us , yes . If we can . Now back away . Get back there with your soldiers . Get back , I said . You , you , you . Come with me . Capitan , the Indian will try to find the mask . You must get there before him . Kill all of them if you have to ... but bring me back the golden mask . Doug , over here . We 've got to run . Come . Run ? After what they did to your mother and father ? - What 's the matter with you ? - He is young . The gods must forgive him . Why did you not strike them dead ? Are you not gods ? We have a legend that other gods would come to help us . We 're not gods , and neither are they . They 're ordinary human beings , just as fallible as we are . - Now we can stop them , the four of us . - Can we ? If they get their hands on that golden mask ... they 'll take all of Mexico without a fight . - Is that what you want ? - My father had three sons . The first he taught the arts of battle . The second he taught to raise crops and store them against famine . Both of these sons were killed when the Spaniards first landed . I am the third , and I 've been taught nothing . So you just give up ? Let them overrun your people , is that it ? They will survive . As slaves . I saw my mother and my father killed . I would sacrifice myself , as well , if it would stop the Spaniards . If you are educated in the arts of war , show me what to do . They have weapons . But you know thejungle . That gives us an advantage . Now where is this cave the Spaniards are looking for ? It is the sacred cave of our people . Only the elders know its exact location . I know the place to look for the signs which will tell us how to reach it . How long will it take us to reach the first marker ? The sign is in some ruins . Perhaps six hours from here . We can be there by dawn . Will the Spaniards have to go to these same ruins ? - Yes . - Well , then we 'll have to beat them there . Come . It 's foolishness . That 's what it is . The numbers may be the same , but the Spaniards have the weapons . Doug and Tony won 't stand a chance against them . If you were in their place , would you do any differently ? Probably not , General , but that doesn 't make it any more sensible . What 'd you find out ? Can the embassy send someone ? Yes . They referred me to a man who knows the jungles ... around Veracruz like the back of his hand . - He 's on his way now . - He 'd better get here very soon . Right . Tony and Doug have decided to fight the Spaniards . Unless we can get them out before that happens ... we may not be able to get them out at all . That 's enough for a test . Touch it off . This powder 's useless . We 're not gonna be able to do much with it . Not without a good deal of compression . I found it . The snake means the sand . - The fish means the water . - A beach . The mouth of the animal indicates a cave . We will find it somewhere in the cliff along the beach . Tony , taste this . - Potassium nitrate . - What have you found ? Something just about as important as that cave of yours . If we mix this with the powder , it 'll increase the force of the explosion - a big enough explosion to collapse that wall on them . [ Phone Buzzes ] Dr. MacGregor . Good . General , it 's Security . Our expert is here . This is General Kirk . No , we need him right now . Send him in immediately and then follow the standard clearance procedure . Right . I 'm General Kirk , Mr. Castillano . How do you do ? I 'm a very busy man , General . I would appreciate it if you 'd let me know why I 've been brought here . Didn 't Security fill you in ? They only told me the purpose of the project - that you send people back in time . Well , that 's correct . But you were asked to come here for a very definite purpose . Two of our scientists have been located in Mexico in the year 1 51 9 . Now we need someone familiar with Veracruz ... to fix landmarks for us so we can get them out . - I may be able to help . I know the area . - Good . This way , please . Oh , Ray . Mr. Castillano , Dr. MacGregor . - How do you do ? - Dr. Swain . - Dr. Swain . - Mr. Castillano . - What is that ? - Well , that 's Mexico , 1 51 9 . Yes , but what is it ? A picture ? A film ? No . That Indian is really there . You 're looking at the living past . Would you tell us when you see a landmark that looks familiar ? Yes . I will do that . [ Groans ] You forget quickly . You have no stomach for revenge . It was your place to kill , to do what had to be done , to be chief . Go back down the trail . If you see any Spaniards , come running . [ Squawking ] [ Groans ] [ Imitates Bird Call ] - Was he alone ? - Si , Capitan . The ruins must be near here . Scout ahead . Where is Rodriguez ? He 's not here . He must have followed them . Look along the walls . The old woman said we would find the signs here . Capitan . The fish and the snake ... as the old woman said . The cave will be found somewhere along the beach . We saw the cliffs as we sailed into the harbor . The cave must be there . This will be a glorious day for Spain and Capitan General Cortes . Does it not sometimes bother you , Capitan ... that so many people must die for the glory of Spain ? You call these savages people ? If we kill them all , what does it matter ? Capitan . Rodriguez . They 've set a trap for us . Ingles . ! Do you hear me , Ingles ? You have caught me unaware this time , Ingles ... but it will not happen again . You cannot stop the destiny which is ours . You have killed one of our men . We have killed one of yours . Now they 've killed your servant . Will you let them kill the rest of your tribe ? I will kill him ! I must avenge them . You 'll get your chance , but you can 't play into his hand . Now he 'd like nothing better than to trick us out of here . There are three of us , three of you . Come out and fight . Are you cowards , Ingles ? - How far is it to the cliff ? - It 's a four-hour journey . All right . Let 's get going . The Spaniards must die . Stand and fight ! Come out ! Come out and fight . ! Do you know that place ? What is the Spaniard looking for ? Oh , some symbol of the " " Tlaxcaltepec " tribe . A golden mask . - A golden mask ? - [ Ann ] General ? Excuse me . It 's Security , sir . They ran Castillano through confirmation . It appears he 's an archaeologist ... who 's had trouble with various South American countries . Something about removing ancient artifacts illegally . The question is , can we trust him ? We don 't have any choice . General Kirk speaking . No , we need him . I 'll take full responsibility . That call was from our security , Mr. Castillano . I wondered at their laxity . But then it should make no difference to you , should it ? No . Your background should simplify things . You already knew about that golden mask , didn 't you ? I spent 20 years looking for it . I have the culture masks of all the tribes except the Tlaxcaltepecs . Then you should also know about those ruins . - I want you to locate them on a map for us . - I need time to observe them - Time is of the essence now , Mr. Castillano . When I 'm sure , I will let you know . What 's going on ? Doesn 't he recognize the ruins ? I think he does . I don 't know what he 's after . But I have a feeling that Mr. Castillano is playing games with us . They will not make a stand against us . They prefer instead to strike at us and run . [ Sighs ] Well , if they will not play our game ... we will play theirs . How far are we from the harbor ? Perhaps five leagues . You will leave the trail . Go straight to the beach . Follow it to the north . I want you at the cliffs before they get there . We will follow them along the trail . And if I meet them ? You will kill them all without warning . Si , Capitan . - How much farther is the cliff ? - Not far now . Is there any chance they could have taken a shortcut to reach it before us ? A good runner could have gone back and followed the beach . - It is possible . - We 're gonna have to split up . Just in case Alvarado tries to flank us . You and the chief go on to the cave . What if all three of them took the beach route ? Then we 're in for worse trouble . [ Snorting ] Very good , Ingles . We will decide the issue here . No , wait . They are defenseless now . It will be like hunting wild pig , only much more interesting . - There . - All right . You go ahead . I 'll stand watch . - Where 's the chief ? - He 's already inside . What happened ? We 've gotta get to the cave . They 're right behind me . You can go no further , senores . Look up . - Where is the Indian ? - I have him here , Capitan . He has a wound in his skull , but he is still alive . You will climb into the cave . You will obey my order , or I 'll kill you both where you are . If you know the Veracruz area ... you must know the location of that cliff . - Yes , I know the location . - All right . Then show it to us on this map . And when I show you the location ... - your machine will pluck them out of there ? - Hopefully , yes . We 've got to have those coordinates . They may decide to kill our men at any minute . In that case , I - I propose a bargain . What do you mean , a bargain ? It has been the dream of my life ... to someday find and locate the golden mask of the Tlaxcaltecs . If it 's in that cave , you will get it for me . Just a moment . You don 't give us orders . - Call it a - a request . - You can call it what you like . You were asked to come here , at a substantial fee ... to do just one thing - to identify a location and give us the coordinates if you know them . - If I know them . - Do you or don 't you ? [ Chuckles ] I do . Which brings us back to my proposed bargain . All right . What bargain ? The lives of your two men for you , the golden mask for me . You 'd bargain with the lives of two men ? It should be a simple thing for you to do . If you can move human beings , you certainly can move a golden mask out of there ... without any trouble . Do we have enough power ? We have enough power , General , but I 'm not sure we have the time . If the mask is in there , you will remove it first before you move your men . Very well . All right . I 'll give you the coordinates . The cliff is here ... on this inlet . It is only fitting that you should see the treasure before I kill you . Bring them . You will not defile my people ! Stop it ! Stop it , or I kill him ! Captain , if you 're gonna kill us , you go ahead and get it over with . No . I have a better use for you . We needed only the golden mask . Instead we find riches beyond measure . Enough to buy a thousand more men for the army of Cortes . The three of you will carry it out on your backs . Make the packs out of this . We 're at full power . Do you have a critical focus , Ray ? Can you take the mask ? We can take it , but I 'm not so sure what it 's gonna do to that cave . The energy of the transfer could bring the roof down on top of them . Can you step up the transfer power by stages ? We can begin the transfer process that way , yes . - We can always alter it . - All right , then that 's the way we 'll do it . If it threatens to collapse the cave , we 'll reverse it . All right . [ Rumbling ] [ Rumbling Continues ] It is the vengeance of the gods . I 'm increasing the power . Keep it steady . Much more , and we 're gonna collapse the cave . [ Ann ] Reverse it . The cave 's gonna collapse . ! Send the mask back . ! - The mask is mine ! I will have it ! - Guards ! - Reverse the impulse ! - It 's too late ! - They 'll be buried alive ! - Then freeze everything in time ! Don 't . You don 't live in the jungle for 20 years ... without knowing how to use one of these . You , take the gun out of your holster with two fingers ... and then drop it . - We had a bargain . - The transfer of the mask has begun to collapse the cave . We 've got to reverse the impulse and send the mask back . The mask is mine , and I 'm going to have it ! Then you may do whatever you want to save your men . Now everyone stand still , please . I will have it . Then you may all go back to work . Ray , what happens if he takes the mask out of the Tunnel ? Without it , we can 't reverse the impulse . We can 't unfreeze the time lock . Tony and Doug , everyone in that cave will be frozen ... - possibly forever . - Can 't we put something else in its place ? It would have to be something else of exactly the same atomic structure and form . - You mean another golden mask ? - I 'm afraid so . - We 're just going to have to get the mask . - But quickly . - It shouldn 't take more than a few minutes . - General ... we haven 't been able to hold the focus on Doug and Tony for more than a few minutes . You 've got to get the mask now before we lose them . - Give me four minutes ? - Three . It is a beautiful mask . It is a mask for which anyone should be willing to give his life . Have I not already given 20 years of mine ? Now ! [ Gunshots Continue ] General , the mask . You mustn 't hit the mask . General Kirk , call them off ! . You have broken your word ! [ Gun Clicking ] No , I will not give it up ! General , we 're beginning to drift off our focus of the cave . Hurry ! - Try to hold it steady . - General , I 'll have to start the countdown . You 've six seconds to get the mask into the Tunnel . - Six , five - - Come on , Castillano , be reasonable . - No , it 's mine ! Mine ! - four ... - three , two - - Mine . ! Mine . ! - And no one shall have it ! - one , zero . - Did we make it ? - Just . The time freeze should be released . All right , men . Take him away . What happened ? We must have all been caught in a time warp . Get the gold . ! All of it . ! [ Rumbling ] Capitan , we must leave the cave while there 's still time ... or we 'll be buried alive . This treasure belongs to Spain . You will not leave here without it ! Gather up the gold ! [ Rumbling ] Let 's get outta here ! Come back ! Come back ! Capitan , we must leave ! - No ! No ! - I have given you an order . - You will obey me ! - [ Groans ] [ Rumbling ] - I must go back for the mask . - There isn 't time ! The cave 's gonna collapse any minute . Then I will die with it . I cannot leave the mask . All right . Then we go back with you . No . This is something I must do alone . Stand up ! I will not kill a man who cannot defend himself . There 's no time for fighting . Not now . The cave will bury us both . - [ Rumbling ] - Fight me ! I will have my vengeance ! I must get it out . I must . [ Rumbling ] I do not understand . He would not fight . In some way , the yellow metal made him sick . I think ... at last , you 're ready to lead your people . Yes , now you are a chief . Come . We will go back . - [ Gunshots ] - [ Men Shouting , Whooping ] [ Shouting , Whooping Continue ] - What 's goin ' on out there ? - Evenin ' . - [ Gunshot ] - Those men - - Saturday night . Just the Triple " " X " boys comin ' into town . Into what town ? We didn 't notice the name as we came in . Lincoln . Pride of Lincoln County ... and of the great territory of New Mexico . You 'll never guess who 's under that hat . Evenin ' , Deputy Hayes . Evenin ' , Billy . Yeah , you 're gettin all prettied up , ain 't ya ? - [ Men Laughing ] - I think you need a little more soap . - Maybe a little bit there . - [ Men Laughing ] - I beg your pardon . - [ Men Laughing ] - The keys . - [ Jangling ] - Hello , Billy . - Good to see ya , boys . May I ? You a friend of his ? I never saw him before . Well , maybe you don 't know who I am . No , I don 't . The name 's Bonney . William Bonney . - Billy the Kid ? - The same .

 [ Kirk ] What 's the trouble ? Feedback - a bad one . They 're frozen in time . If we don 't get them moving within a few seconds , they 'll be burned to death . - Can you send them back to where they were ? - We can try it . - Reverse ! - No ! Ah , yes . Just as I expected . Toys . Mere toys . Yes , simple . Predictably simple . [ Chuckles ] Such a to-do about a commonplace bit of magic . Hear me , you travelers in time . It is I , Merlin , mightiest of all wizards , who commands you . At a sign from me , you will leave the limbo of time ... and appear in this place before me . Yes . Welcome , gentlemen . Welcome ... home . Yes . Yes , you 'll do . You 'll do very nicely . Permit me to introduce myself . I am Merlin ... soon to be court wizard for the greatest monarch of them all - King Arthur of the Round Table . Gentlemen ... without you , there will be serious trouble in Camelot . Serious trouble . Therefore , I must press you into service . You may be killed . I can make no guarantee , except that I shall try very hard to see that you 're not . When next we meet , you will remember nothing of this meeting ... but you will do whatever I ask . Go . We shall meet again . - Polarity . - Right . [ Ray ] We did it . ! Doug , look . We 're a long way back . Could be Europe in the Middle Ages . Maybe earlier . We 'd better keep out of sight until we find out a little more . [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . Vikings . They may be back with reinforcements . - Let 's get as far away from here as we can . - [ Man ] Stand . ! Put away your spear . Drop it to the ground . - After you 've put away your sword . - You 've had your last warning . Put that sword down , or I 'll run you through . Surrender or die . You are not Vikings . You look like nothing I have ever seen before . - Where do you come from ? - America . America ? Does such a land exist ? We 're beginning to wonder . How did you come by this ? We took it from two Viking warriors . Then you are warriors in your own right . We can use every stout arm we can find . - We ? - The land is being invaded by Vikings . There are not enough men to oppose them . Will you join us ? - Well , why should we ? - Either you are with us or against us . - We want no part of your fight . - Cowards ! No ! No , no , no , no , no . Put that thing away , young Arthur . I 'm here to help you . Who are you , old man ? One day , you will know me very well indeed . I 've seen him somewhere before . - I 'm sure of it . - So have I. But I wonder where . Gentlemen , you will fight for this young man . You will pledge your lives to his safety . - We 'll fight alongside you against the Vikings . - You lead , and we 'll follow . My thanks to you both . This way . Wait - the old man . He 's gone . - Can you shift them ? - Not yet . - We 're building power . - It 'll take another 1 5 minutes at least . There 's no telling what danger they 're heading for . There 's nothing we can do until we 've built enough power , General . - What 's the time fix ? - Sixth century . I 've narrowed it down to 544 A.D. - Spatial fix ? - The coast of Cornwall , in England . I 'll get full research data . I hope we still need it . Arthur . - You 're leading us away from the castle . Why ? - We thought you came from there . I did once . Now it 's being held by Vikings . I see . And you 've gathered an army to retake it . - Not quite . I 've just begun to raise men . - How many do you have so far ? Two . [ Scoffs ] You mean , we 're your army ? So far , yes . Well , there 's nothing like starting at the bottom . [ Groans ] Hold ! On your feet ! Up ! - Your name . - I am Arthur Pendragon . I thought so . The young son of King Uther . The man you murdered in cold blood . I have sworn an oath of vengeance against you , Wogan . So , young Arthur , we meet face to face and you threaten my life . Just put a sword in my hand , and I 'll have your head . The young lamb who roars like a lion , huh ? I promise you this , you and your warrior friend - before I 'm done , you 'll beg for a merciful death . Take him away ! What 's the matter ? What 's going on ? - Doug 's dead . - What ? It 's true , I 'm afraid , General . We saw one of the men run him through with a sword . - His body was dragged away . - Oh , no . - And Tony ? - Captured . Now that they 're separated ... we 've lost our fix on them completely . Well , probe for it . Get them back . What 's the use , now that Doug 's dead ? Tony 's still alive . Snap out of it , Ann . Find him ! Yes , sir . - Anything in the research that might help us ? - No , I doubt it . England in the sixth century was ruled by a number of feudal kings . The country was constantly being raided and plundered by Viking hordes . I 'm afraid we landed Tony and Doug right in the middle of one of those raids . Probably cost them their lives . Oh , now , Ray , I know how you 're feeling right now . I feel the same way myself . Don 't write off either Tony or Doug just yet . - We 've got to find some way to save them . - That would take a miracle . Well , perhaps . But it 's something of a miracle that they 're back there in the first place . I suppose it is . I 'm getting a signal ! Easy now . Don 't lose it . Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! Arthur , the once-and-future king . There never was a real King Arthur . He 's a myth , a fairy tale . Perhaps . Or could this be part of that miracle you said we needed ? This is no time for romantic nonsense , General . Ann , we have enough power now . Switch Tony while we can . No . ! I wanna be certain about Doug first . Start a probe for him . General , I 'd like nothing more . But we just can 't risk it . We 'd lose Tony . We know Doug is dead . We saw him killed . Now we can lose both of them . If Doug 's alive , we can save both of them . Start the probe . Better follow orders . Yes , sir . - No , wait ! - I saw it ! A reaction ! We 're getting something . Refine it ! He is alive . He must be . We wouldn 't be getting that signal . Find him ! [ Exhales ] You again ? I would appreciate a show of gratitude . I rescued you from the battle last night and brought you here . Brought me where ? You 're in the castle of King Leodegran of Carmelide . - I am his daughter . - You must have a name . I 'm called Guinevere . The real Guinevere ? I know of no other . [ Chuckles ] I 'm impressed . You must rest . You 've been sorely wounded in a battle . You left before the battle began . - How did you find me ? - [ Chuckles ] Uh , that 's a professional secret . - It 's enough that I did . - [ Groans ] Don 't try and move . Anyhow , I 'm indebted to you . Yes . Yes . You most certainly are . [ Chuckles ] Young lady , don 't just stand there . Get him some clothing . Clothing ? Now ? Yes . There 's no time to convalesce . There 's much to do and precious little time to do it . His wound 's near mortal . I saw it . The slightest move could kill him . Stuff and nonsense , girl . Young man , sit up . No ! You mustn 't try and move . Sit up . There 's no pain at all . Nothing . The wound - It 's gone . Of course it 's gone . Now , get him some clothing . Well , go , girl . Go . Who are you ? I 'd have thought you 'd have guessed by now . My name is well known , even in your time . - What do you know about my time ? - [ Chuckles ] I know everything about your time . I know everything about you , and I know everything about your friend . Oh , yes . My name . It 's Merlin . - [ Choking ] - Where 's the other prisoner ? Tell me . Where ? - Now talk . Where ? - [ Grunts ] Tell me ! North dungeon . Down the hall . Right . How did you escape ? You 'd better flee while you can . Not without you . [ Gasping ] How long have I been here ? Since dawn . - Come on , try to stand . - No , I - I - I - No , I can 't . - I can 't . - Okay , rest a minute . Put this on . Do you know where we are ? My father 's castle on the coast . Is there somewhere we could hide ? Hide ? Yes , there 's a place . It 's a secret room . Give me a hand . I 'll show you . Here . A messenger has just arrived . Vikings have taken prisoners to the castle on the coast . - What prisoners ? - There were two . Both young men . That would be Tony . And the other would be Arthur . - I must get to them . - You can 't go there . It 's certain death . - Well , I have to find some way to rescue them . - But not that way . You must have help , a plan . Well , how about your father ? He has fighting knights . Barely enough to protect our castle . They 're no match for the Vikings . - How far is the castle ? - Several leagues to the south . All right . I 'll go there , and I 'll scout their stronghold . I 'll think of some kind of plan . Then let me show you the way . No , it 's much too dangerous . I want you to stay here . - How good is this fix on Doug ? - Nearly perfect . I don 't understand . We saw Doug wounded . And now he 's completely well . There 's only one way to explain , it , Ann . I know , General . Another one of your miracles . You can explain it any way you want , Ray . We 've still got a fix . Can you hold the fix on Doug while we establish one for Tony ? Well , we 've never done it before , but - - Well ? - The fix on Doug is stable . - I think I can hold it . - Good . When we stabilize the fix on Tony , we 'll switch them both . How do you feel now ? [ Exhales ] Better . You 're still weak . You need more rest . But you 'll escape . I know it . You 're Arthur Pendragon . Yes . The son of a dead king who ruled a small corner of this land . They can 't hide there indefinitely . The picture 's clear enough . Is your fix stable ? - Very . - Power ? - Adequate . - All right . - Switch them ! Now ! - No . ! Young lady , you will touch no controls until further notice . - We never touched the controls . How did he materialize ? - Switch them at once ! [ Screams ] - Are you hurt ? - No , no . No , it 's all right . Young lady , you must learn to obey orders . Wait a minute . What is this ? Who are you ? How 'd you get in here ? Oh , let 's not waste time with unnecessary questions . I 've a great deal to do and very little time to do it . Quickly-your name . I 'm General Kirk . I 'm in charge of the - Just a minute . What the devil 's the meaning of this ? My name is Merlin . Merlin ? King Arthur 's magician ? Ah , yes , the post I 'm destined to hold . You see , General Kirk , I deal in history before the fact . Certain things are written in the pages of prophecy . It 's my job to give them a little nudge towards fulfillment . Well , we 're in very much the same business . Certain things are written down in the pages of history . It 's myjob to see that they 're not changed . General , we 're losing our chance to shift them . Ah , they must remain where they are . You are forbidden to move them . And how are you going to stop us ? I am a powerful wizard . I deal in magic . We don 't believe in magic . This is the 20th century . The 20th century ? The very heyday of magic , and you , sir , do not believe ? Very well . I shall convince you . Dr. Swain ! Dr. Swain ? - What have you done ? Where have you sent him ? - Where , my dear general ? Why , nowhere at all . He 's still with us . Do let me demonstrate . Ray ! - Are you all right ? You 're not hurt , are you ? - Of course not . - How did you do that ? - Oh . Magic , my dear fellow . - [ Chuckles ] Sheer magic . - All right , all right . You claim to be in a hurry . For what ? Why did you come here ? To prevent you moving your travelers from our time just yet . You 're asking me to let two men die out there ? They won 't die unless you waste too much of my time . Even if you are a wizard , Doug and Tony aren 't . They can 't help you . On the contrary , young lady . They must help . Magic can only accomplish so much . After that , it takes the energies of ordinary mortals dedicated to a cause . We can shift them in spite of you . My dear fellow , do let me give you a friendly word of warning . Don 't . [ Crew Members Murmuring ] Seize them . [ Brush Rustling ] [ Whispering ] Guinevere . - Why did you run off ? - I told you not to come . You don 't know what you 're doing . This area 's full of Viking scouting parties . - All the more reason for you to be back at that castle . - No . I can show you a way to get to their castle , but we must hurry . [ Viking Horn Blares ] [ Blows Landing ] We 've got a fix on Doug and one on Tony . Now 's the time to switch them . I agree . Go ahead , Ann . Well , go on . We were warned not to touch the controls . - By that fake magician ? - You sure he was fake , Ray ? I believe so . Ray , how do you explain all those things he did ? Mass hypnosis . It 's not an unheard-of phenomenon . - I wish I could be that certain . - Well , I am . It 's the only scientific explanation . Ann , you can use the controls . If he isn 't here , there isn 't any way he can exert his influence on us . Ray , I 'm not sure . Well , Ann , I am . I 'll do it . [ Ann ] Oh , Ray . ! - He 's not - - No , no . I think he 's badly hurt . Get some help , quickly . Tony . - So this is Wogan , the Viking butcher . - I 'm honored . I didn 't think you 'd recognize me . Any Briton would recognize you ... and give his life to know you were lying dead . Many have already given their lives . [ Chuckles ] But not you . Oh , no . Not you . I have other plans for you . Someday , when I am king of England ... I shall barter you off to some powerful young nobleman ... in exchange for his loyalty . The king of this miserable land ... will have to be ready to make many bargains . You , a king ? I will be , and soon . But first I must crush all the resistance ... of your countrymen . But that won 't be hard . - Then I shall be ready to be crowned . - You 'll never wear it . We 'll see . Oh , please , make yourself comfortable . We 'll talk again . Don 't try to escape . You 'll only regret it . Doug . It is you . I thought I was dreaming . It 's no dream , Tony . And now I 'm as helpless as you are . What about him ? He 's alive , I think . We 've had a rough time . They 're not through with us yet . And there 's no way to get out of here . - At least not without help . - You mean the Time Tunnel . Forget it . They would have switched us a long time ago if they had a fix on us . No , I wasn 't thinking about the Time Tunnel . I was thinking about Merlin . - Merlin ? - Yes . Remember the old man that was there when we first materialized ? He 's no friend of ours . He got us into this . Yeah . Is he good , or is he evil ? The fierce young warrior no longer looks so fierce . Wogan , what have you done with Guinevere ? She 's safe enough . Worry about yourself . - You know her father 's men will come here to rescue her . - A handful of pretty knights . I hope they come soon . My men are ready to greet them right now . Too bad the three of you won 't be here to witness the slaughter . - I 'll still fight you , Wogan . - I 'm weary of children 's games . I 'm weary of you . Bowman ! This one first . Then the other two . And make it quick . - Where 's your Merlin now ? - I don 't know . I was sure he would appear . Stop . ! - You 're a little late . - I was detained . I 'm afraid there is nothing to do but - [ Thunder Crashing ] [ Sighs ] I didn 't want to put time into reverse . I 've already violated every rule in the book , but it couldn 't be helped . There is still much to be done . It 's a miracle . It 's as though nothing had happened . You 'll need all of your strength . The battle is yet to be won . If you can perform this kind of miracle , you don 't need us . Wrong . Certain things must be done by men , not magic . Winning a throne is one of them . - Then we 'll have to work fast . Get us out of here . - I can 't . I 've already used too much magic . I can only work one more miracle for some time to come ... and I intend to save that for a real emergency . In short , gentlemen , the next step is entirely up to your collective ingenuity . You 're from the future . Use your knowledge . - What did he mean by " " the future " ? - We 'll explain it when we can . Is there any way to get through that bolted door ? You can 't break that down . It would take 1 0 men to do it . Then we 'll need the power of 1 0 men . There isn 't much to work with , is there ? You can say that again . Look . With that lid and that pot - I 've got a little bit of water in here . - If we can find a way to anchor this down - - Right . - What are these ? - Thumbscrews . - It 's a torture device . You place one on each thumb - - Never mind . They 'll work . - It 'll be like a pressure cooker without a safety valve . - That 's right . - I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . - Don 't try . Get a couple of torches . Check it and see if there 's any leaks . - I think it 's gonna be all right . - Yeah . All right , now ... start cooking . Suppose you do open the door . What then ? We escape , of course . - And Guinevere ? - She goes with us . No , that 's not enough . Wogan and his Vikings must be driven from our shores . We 'd do more to bring that about if we stayed with the castle . There are only three of us . What could we do against an army of Vikings ? An army . Guinevere 's father would send knights against the castle if we could only get to him . We might have a chance . - [ Water Boiling ] - It 's almost ready . - What will it do ? - You 'll find out in a minute . Doug , when we do get out ... you go for King Leodegran 's men . Arthur and I will split up , see if we can find where they 're keeping Guinevere . - Right . But how do I get out of here ? - I know a way . I 'll show you . Let 's get moving . - Ann . - Hmm ? Oh , how 's Ray ? Well , he 's better . But he suffered a severe electrical shock . Poor Ray . I should never have let him touch those controls . He 'll be all right . Doc gave him a sedative . He 's resting quietly in the infirmary . Now that we 've lost all contact , what are we going to do ? I 've ordered an emergency crew of electronic experts to go over all circuits . But we can 't touch the controls until they 've reported it safe . Well , what about Doug and Tony ? They 'll have to hang on until we can reach them . - Arthur ! - I 've located a chamber . - Where ? - In the turret room , directly below the watchtower . - Is it guarded ? - Heavily . - How do we get up there ? - I have a secret way . Follow me . That 's the tower . Bring the rest of the men up forward . But keep them well under cover . The signal will come when the moment to attack is right . Attack ? With what ? Merlin . I said attack with what ? - King Leodegran gave me his men . - A pitiful , shivering handful of knights . - Every man he could spare . - The Vikings will slaughter them . Vikings have no fear of gentlemen fighters . Vikings only fear other Vikings . Sorry . I don 't have any . I do . What are you talking about ? Vikings attacking Vikings . An inspired thought . Yes , Merlin , a truly inspired thought . We shall storm the castle with Vikings . - How ? - You forget . I have been saving a miracle . Now is the time to spend it . You are a Viking . [ Thunder Crashing ] Vikings all ! [ Thunder Crashing ] I 'm out of miracles , my son . The rest is up to you . [ Screams ] Well done . The chamber is directly below . I 'll warn her . You stand guard . [ Footsteps ] - Who are you ? - There 's no time for explanations.Just listen . Friends are going to attack the castle and destroy the invaders . Our job is to keep you alive until the battle is over . When the attack begins , the guards outside your door are going to man the battlements . - Someone will come in to get you . Is that clear ? - Yes , I understand . Good . Expect him . - Is she all right ? - Frightened , but well . And beautiful . - I should like to get to know her better one day . - You will . - How soon should I give the signal ? - Now . My plans are made . I know this castle better than they do . I shall make their defenses worthless . There 's the signal . Pass the word . We 'll attack the castle now . [ Blaring ] To arms ! The castle 's attacked ! To arms ! Come with me . So your father 's men attack . Good . We 'll kill them all , beginning with you . [ Man ] Vikings . ! Vikings . ! We 're attacked by Vikings . ! To arms . ! [ Grunts ] Come on ! [ Shouting ] [ Shouting , Screaming ] They 've checked out all the circuits , Ann . Controls are safe to use now . Let 's get a fix on the boys and switch them fast . That young man will rule all of England one day . [ Merlin Chuckles ] Oh , by the way , old King Leodegran was most grateful - for saving his daughter and for driving the Vikings from these shores . - He 's giving Arthur a most handsome reward . - What ? Nothing less than the hand of his daughter , Guinevere , in marriage . Oh , yes , and part of the dowry includes ... a very large , very valuable ... very handsome ... round table . [ Chuckles ] So , you see ... things do have a way of sort of working themselves out . Oh , one more thing . Arthur 's already told me that you two are to be the very first ... knights of his round table . The age of miracles has just begun . [ Frequency Pitch Wavering ] That 's strange . - What 's wrong ? - I don 't know . Ray , what do you make of that ? - They look like interference waves . - That 's what I thought . - But we never use those frequencies . - I 'll have it checked out . This interference - Is there any way it could affect Tony and Doug ? - No , I don 't believe so . - This is Dr. Swain . Will you run an immediate check on channels 1 00 to infinity ? Yes , it 's interference . And make it quick . [ Loud Crashing ] - [ Gasps ] - How did he get here ? Dr. Ann MacGregor ! I 'm here to take you with me ! Who are you ? Now , wait ! You can 't - General ! Hold your fire ! [ Screams ] Take him to the infirmary ! Ann - Ann is gone ! But where ? - General , we 've got to find her ! - Yes . But how ? I wish I knew . I wish I knew where he came from . You know , he looked as though he might have been a time traveler from the future . - Look . - What ? Looks like one of our data cards . - Ray , do you think our computer can handle this ? - Let 's try it . I hope this doesn 't jam the machine . [ Whirring ]

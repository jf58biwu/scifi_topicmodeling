 [ theme music plays ] [ engine revving ] [ honking ] [ tyres screech ] [ crashing ] [ siren rings ] We 'd better check them for Contact Certificates . Yes , sir . Valid and up to date I hope , sir . - Yes , they 're valid but- - - They 're all right , then . I 'm afraid not . They 're mutuals only . Neither had contact with a third party . [ voiceover ] Might you have been caught like this young couple ? Good evening . As you all know , it 's just over a year now , since this Government introduced Contact on a national scale . Now , I 'm not here tonight to list its virtues , the hope , and the reassurance that it has given to the old and the aged . the relief of loneliness , the benefits that can be felt in all aspects of our daily life . All . All this is well known to you . What I do want to emphasise , is that we still have a lot to learn . Take this film you 've just seen . Thousands of people are going about their daily life , even now , without the added security of a third Contact . Damn fools if they are . Don 't want any more of this , sir , do you ? Not for me , thank you very much . [ turns TV off ] All they can think about now isn 't it ? Contact . Small matters like the Economy , you wouldn 't think they existed . Oh , I agree with you . Absolutely . Let 's see , 51 new pence isn 't it ? Afraid so , sir . Here 's to using it now just as a smokescreen . Keep the public thinking of Contact , they won 't notice the prices going up . Pray and hope . [ till rings ] Wakey , wakey , you look miles away . - They stopped existing . - What ? Those two people on television . It was just like it used to be . They died . Horrible . Don 't upset yourself , Mary . It wasn 't the real thing . Just a mock-up . Propaganda , that 's all . Even so , to be reminded . - Good evening , George . - Good evening , sir . Large Scotch , please . Nice to see you in here again , Mr. Hale . It must have been about 18 months . Oh , no . Not as long as that , is it ? I think so , sir . Well , tonight 's my chance to make up for lost time . The family 's staying up north overnight , so , I 'm out on the loose . I 've been going around all my old haunts . Very quiet in here tonight . Not like the old days . The price of things , what can you expect , sir ? Yes . Of course . I thought for a moment you were going to say it was something to do with Contact . No , no . That brought us quite a bit of business in really . - Contact did ? - Hmm . Bit grim at first though . Half the customers wanted to make Contact with us . ln fact , I know one barman , he really got lumbered . - Six or seven of them . - What did he do ? Well , he suddenly realised what 'd happen if they all came home to roost at once . So he went down and he had them expunged , quick . Oh , yes . I think we 've a lot to be thankful for with Contact . I mean , it 's made people calmer , more considerate toward each other . Yes , because they know if they don 't behave themselves , their own Contact will expunge them . Yeah but , you know . I think it 's made us less - careful about our own safety . - Possibly . I mean , we don 't have to be scared of dying now , do we ? As long as it 's quick , without any pain , it 's just a matter of , blacking out and picking up again in somebody else . Yes , have you picked anyone up ? Not yet , sir . But I 'm expecting to . Bloke I knew in the army . Builder . He 's had an accident at work . Nasty . Quite frankly sir , if he does come across it 's the pain I 'm wondering about . What about you , sir ? Oh , yes . A couple of months ago , my father . All right , was it ? It was a bit uncomfortable at first . Like an itch you can 't scratch . But he soon blended in . And there 's no doubt , I mean about whose memory belongs to who ? No , all his memories have a kind of label . The funniest thing is being able to see yourself as a baby in your own cot . What are you drinking ? That 's very kind of you Mr Hale . I 'll have a sparkling soda . Oh , there you are . I 've been looking everywhere for you . I went home . You weren 't at home . There was no message . Look , I 've told you before , if you go out at night , you leave a message . - Why should she ? - What ? She can do what she likes . She 's a free agent . Is this bloke bothering you ? Making a nuisance of himself ? - How did you get here anyway ? - Sam brought me . By car ? Of course I did . What 's he talking about ? Down the motorway ? At this time of night ? - You 've said your piece- - - Now Sam , please . No you 've finished with him . You 're past history chum . What you talking about ? - Tell him , Mary . - Tell me what ? She 's expunged you , that 's what . Did you get that ? You 've been expunged ! Well , it 's fascinating how they got onto Contact . Says here , they were working with printed molecule circuits . I haven 't had any trouble in here for about a year now but I still remember what it looks like . Because of him ? Tell me Mary , tell me . Sam had nothing to do with it . It was my idea . And your fault . - My fault ? - Well , of course it was . - Leave her alone . - Thank you , sir . - It 's all right we 're just leaving . Mary ? - Mary ? Goodnight , Miss . [ exhales ] Get me a Scotch . [ Patrick chuckles lightly ] You better leave the whole bottle . I 'll need that . Keep the change . [ till rings ] [ laughs ] I suppose you know what all that was about ? No idea . The lady expunged me . - I 'm sorry . - The cow . - I wouldn 't have thought- - - What ? She looked sympathetic enough . - Have you got Contacts ? - Well , of course I have . More than one ? My wife and I have a mutual . Oh , I see , you 're a family man . And if anything happens to us together like a car crash or something , we 're covered by my wife 's brother . - Yes , I see . - No different from most people . [ chuckles dryly ] You don 't mean she was the only one ? - That 's right . - Did she know ? Yes , she knew . That 's why she did it without telling me . When my back was turned . But you can 't keep an eye on people all the time , can you ? No . Hey steady ! Thanks . Still there are plenty more , aren 't there ? You 've got plenty more friends . - Friends ? No , not really . - Well ... Family ? No family . That must sound pretty bad to you , doesn 't it ? Terrible . It 's not the first time I 've been without Contact . There was a time before Mary ... I don 't know . I seem to find it hard to get through to people . The name 's Wilson , by the way . Patrick Wilson . James Hale . There should be somebody ? Of course there should . By law there should . But you know the Government had to rush things , anything to get the scheme started . The details , such as working out reserve pools of emergency contacts , all that could be organised later . Too late for some , no doubt . But you must know somebody who 'll take you on . Oh , yes , plenty , don 't worry about me . I 'll get one of the blokes at work . May take a little time though . That 's the snag . Persuade him . That 's a big step . I don 't suppose you 'd tide me over , in case of accidents ? Me ? Oh , what am I saying you 've got a wife . Kids too , I expect . - Yes . Twins . - Oh , marvellous . Boys or girls ? One of each . Eleven months old . - I bet you 're proud of them . - Wouldn 't you be ? I 've got a picture of them somewhere . It 's the night that 's the worst , of course . You lie in bed , staring at the dark . You 're a kind of a living ghost . The only " contact " you 've got is with this stuff . Wait . Stop ! You 'll walk under a bus or something . Most likely . Don 't you think you should sober up a bit first ? - Why ? - Look ... If it really is just for a day or two- - - You mean it ? - Well- - You 're not having a joke with me ? No , no . I couldn 't let you walk out of there in your condition . Not even my worst enemy . You won 't regret it , Jimmy . I 'm telling you . Where can we go ? All the agencies are shut at this time of night . London Airport . All night service . People wanting extra cover , before flying out . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Let 's not waste any time . Let 's grab a cab and get out there . Come on , quickly . [ female voice over PA ] You know , it gets me this place . Every time I come here . - You been here before ? - Yes , I 've been here before . Why ? Wait a minute , I know . You come here to pick someone up . Oh , Jimmy , what are you talking about ? No , I 've heard about this place ... What do you take me for ? I 'm interested in people . I like to see how other folk take to Contact . The less fortunate , the drunks . The drop-outs . And the very young . - What you doing ? - What 's the matter ? Don 't you like it ? Doesn 't your mummy know your here ? At one time you know it used to be Gretna Green . Dave ! Hey , Mister . Hello , Dave . - You leave her alone . - You better watch it , sonny . I may be her uncle , come to take her home . I never seen him before , Dave , honest . She 's lying . Come on , we 're getting out of here . [ laughing manically ] Ah-ah-ah ! - What did you want to do that for ? - Do what ? They weren 't harming anybody . I was only kidding them . Probably doing them a favour . Stop them rushing into foolish Contacts . There is such a thing as the age of consent , you know . - Where are you going ? - Going home . Now , Jimmy , you can 't do that . You 're not going back on your word , are you ? Look . I 've had my fair share of troubles but I 'm not such a bad bloke . ln any case , I look upon this as a kind of experiment . Experiment ? Two personalities diametrically opposed , You and me . Coming together under the same dome . We 're pioneers you and I , offering ourselves as guinea pigs . Researching the frontiers of Contact , for the benefit of mankind . - That 's how you see it ? - That 's how it is . Come sit down , come on . We 're next . Come on , old lad , up we go . I say . Good evening . Good morning . Can I have your names , please ? Mine 's Patrick Wilson . This is James Hale . H-A-L-E . - Your occupation , Mr. Hale ? - Business Executive . Business Executive . - And yours , Mr Wilson ? - Salesman . Salesman . - I take it you want a mutual . - Yes . - No . - Wait a minute . What 's the matter , old man ? - It really is advisable . - Yes . No , I 'm sorry . Don 't worry about the money . I 'll pay for it . No , no , no . It 's not fair on my family . If anything happens to me and I get picked up by someone they don 't know , they 'd be very upset . That 's right , your absolutely right . I appreciate that I really do . Make it just one way . Me over to him . As you wish . If you go through that door , Mr Wilson . And you through that door , Mr Hale . Thank you . Jimmy . Come on , old lad . - What 's the matter ? - What ? Good luck , old boy . - Good evening , sir . - Good evening . I 'm sure you 've done all this before . Yes , twice . Sit down there , please . Thank you very much . [ squeaking ] [ sonic whirring ] Your Contact Certificate , Mr. Wilson . Valid for five years . Oh , thank you . Now , let 's get this straight . If I die- - Instantaneous transfer . You 'd better take one of these booklets . It tells you all you need to know . The recommended reinforcements for personality development , adjustment lapse , temporal geographical factor- - Yes , I know all about it . The fact is , we 've had a bit of party , and I was wondering- - No , there 's no known effect . The process goes through , sober or drunk . That 's what I wanted to know about . Your Contact Certificate , Mr Hale . Thank you . You all right ? Hey , you look terrible ! You better have a drink . Outside if you don 't mind . Yes , all right . Thank you very much . Come on , Jimmy , I 'll take you home . Don 't worry about a thing . You 're perfectly all right with me . Can I have the next lot in , please ? I 'm afraid it 's just not possible , madam . [ Patrick laughing , shushing ] No , you don 't have to do that . They 're away for the night . - Who 's away ? - My wife and the twins . They don 't get back till tomorrow . - You told me . - Staying with her father . - Did they arrive safely ? - I don 't know . You mean you didn 't telephone to find out ? No . No , I don 't have to do that . [ Patrick exhales ] [ hums to himself ] Jimmy . Wakey , wakey . Come on , old boy . - Hey . - Ups-a-daisy . Hey , you don 't think something 's happened to them do you ? You 've got to look after them , old boy . If something 's happened , I would know , wouldn 't I ? If they 'd been killed , I 'd be getting them coming through ? What are you doing ? Putting you to bed , old boy . Oh , thanks . If you want to stay ... Spare room ... - You just take it easy . - Blankets in the cupboard . - Take it easy . - Help yourself ... I will , I will . You 're a really good friend . I 'm just helping you out until you get fixed up at work . I know , I know . [ singing ] # Can 't stand by when a friend 's in trouble # I know Jimmy , I know . And I 'll repay you . Even if it takes me years . And that 's a promise . [ dials number , hums ] [ hums ] Mary . Did I wake you up ? I 'm so sorry . Patrick , who do you think ? Listen , I 've got some news for you . You will be , when you hear it . [ door bell ringing ] Mr. Hale ? Um ... Yes . Yes . May I come in for a moment , please ? - Please do , yes . - Thank you . I expect you 're wondering who I am . - No , I remember . - George 's Bar . Last night . Yes . - May I sit down ? - Oh , I 'm sorry . Please , yes . This is rather difficult . First , let me introduce myself . My name 's Mary Bridgwood . I understand that after we left the bar last night , Patrick asked you to make Contact with him . - Who ? - Patrick Wilson . Oh , yes , that 's right . - You didn 't agree to it I hope ? - Yes , I did . We went to London Airport . Then he was telling the truth for once . I 'm sorry , what 's all this about ? He rang me up at two o 'clock this morning . My first reaction was to put the receiver down but I hung on and got your name and part of your address from him . The rest I found in the phone book . I 've come around because I wouldn 't want anyone have Patrick wished on them . No ? For the past years , he 's conned I don 't know how many people into making Contact with him . And he 's been expunged by every one of them . I lasted about two months . Longer than most . Probably the record . What 's wrong with him ? What are you doing here ? I could ask the same of you . Jimmy , what 's she been saying about me ? Nothing , old boy . Calm down . Not content with expunging me and leaving me without a Contact in the world , she has to come here , and persuade you to do the same . - You really must hate me . - Of course , she doesn 't . Tell her , Jimmy . Tell her what I 'm doing here . If I hadn 't brought him home last night , there 's not knowing where he 'd have ended up . That 's true . We had a bit to drink . Knocked down in the gutter by someone who didn 't care who he hits because he 's all right . He has Contacts . Look , Patrick , let me talk to her . Let me explain . All I 'm doing is simply helping Patrick out . Tiding him over- - Until he 's had time to make his own arrangements . Is that what he told you ? - With someone he knows at work . - He has no work . She 's lying . Don 't listen to her . That 's just how he started with me . Yes well , I don 't think anyone should be without Contact these days . - Thank you . - No matter who he is or what he 's done . Yes , well I felt the same . Until he started buying me presents , doing me favours , saying that I was the only friend he had in the world . Then he moved into my home , followed me everywhere I went just to make sure nothing happened to me . Where would I have been if something had ? Look , it 's very kind of you to come round . Both of you . But you really must excuse me . My family 's due home in a couple of hours , and I promised to clean the place up . I 'll give you a hand , Jimmy . It 's the least I can do . Don 't say I didn 't warn you . - Goodbye , Mr. Hale . - Goodbye . Honestly , Jimmy , have you ever met such a vindictive woman ? Well , I understand it . ln this article I was reading , it said that at the start what they were after was mechanical telepathy . They found that with printed molecule circuits , they could scan the entire contents of a brain , and transfer it to an electronic store . So , instead of telepathy they ended up with immortality . This really is the most delicious soup . Don 't thank me . Thank my husband . It comes from his firm . - It 's not bad , is it ? - Out of this world . Would you care for some more , Mr. Wilson ? No , thank you . Please call me Patrick . After what James did for me , I feel I must be regarded as a friend of the family . Mmm . By the way , I never found out what your job was . You 're not worried about what Mary said , are you ? She really shouldn 't go round telling such lies . - What is it you do ? - Sell space . Space ? Advertising space for a movie magazine . Oh . Talking of movies , darling , we mustn 't miss that pre-Contact film . Tomorrow 's the last night . You don 't want to see that thing . Soldiers shooting and murdering each other and no Contact ? Darling , you don 't mean ... Wait a minute , that 's not you speaking now , is it ? What do you mean , not me ? My stuffy old father again . Pompous old thing . No sense of humour at all . I 'm sorry . I try to keep him quiet . It 's only on occasion- - Well , this film for instance ... But you , the James you , you do want to go don 't you ? Well , I 'm not sure I 'd have the stomach for it . Darling , of course you would . Cynthia and Henry saw it in Manchester and they loved it . Henry 's my brother . We have Contact . Oh , I see . All right , I 'll take you , if it means so much to you . It does . Remind me to ask Mrs. Allan . She 's our babysitter down the road . Not Mrs. Allan , darling . Not Tuesdays . It really is good of you to help us out . I hope it 's not too much trouble . Of course not . Course not . Glad to . The fact is , dear old Mrs. Allan down the road , she has to go to the Adjustment clinic on Tuesdays . Whatever for ? She picked up her husband last month , but he was a compulsive gambler . - And now she 's at it ? - They 're trying to put her right before she blows her entire pension . I really don 't think you should tell that story , darling . Oh , it 's all right to tell Patrick . Yes , I 'll keep mum . Thank you . Both the children are fast asleep . Got everything you want ? Drinks over there . Yes , don 't worry about me . You go and enjoy yourselves . Thank you again . Please , don 't mention it . And mind the traffic , won 't you ? [ faint chugging of car engine ] [ laughter ] [ gunfire ] [ laughter continues ] Patrick , what the devil 's going on ? Have you just come out and left them ? - Jimmy , I can explain . - You 'd better . I only wanted to make sure you 're all right . What are you doing here ? What about our babies ? Are you mad ? - I can explain . - I 'm warning you- - Come on , James , don 't waste time talking to him . Jimmy . [ crying ] There , there , my darlings , Shh . Shh . It 's all right , Mummy 's here . Mummy 's with you . There 's nothing to be frightened of . - Are they all right ? - Yes , I think so . [ child wailing ] Shh . Shh . Darling , it 's all right . Now , now . [ babies continue crying ] Traffic 's bad at this time of night . You might have had an accident . I got worried sitting here all alone . I only wanted to make sure you go there safely . - Get out of here . Get out ! - No , Jimmy . You 're the only friend I 've got- - Friend ? I wouldn 't call you a friend if you were the last man on Earth . I did you a favour . And you 've paid me back , the way that woman said you would . I 'm going straight to a Contact Agency and have you expunged . Jimmy ! You can 't do that . Jimmy ! It 's inhuman . Jimmy ! What are you thinking about ? I 'm just wondering if we weren 't a bit hard on him . Of course we weren 't . Think of the twins , James . Just think what might have happened . He did a terrible thing to us and the sooner we get rid of him , the better . How you get mixed up with him in the first place- - I know , I know . It 's just that he seems so- - You 're too soft with people . Now go to sleep and forget about him . He was so desperate . I 've never seen a man in such a state . Supposing he did something mad , like , like killing himself . He wouldn 't ! James , he couldn 't ! We 'd better get Mrs. Allan for the twins . - I 'll ring her . - Do we know his address ? Oh , yes ! He made sure of that all right . Here it is . Top of the stairs . Number 24 . [ Rowena ] Quickly , darling . [ footsteps on stairs ] [ knocking ] Patrick , Patrick . It 's James . [ sobbing ] Maybe he 's not in . Yes , he is . I can hear him . He 's laughing . Patrick . Look , I 'm sorry about what happened . Open the door and let 's talk about it . Is he laughing or crying ? I don 't know . Let 's go in . Come on . [ gunshot ] [ Rowena screams ] Is he coming over ? Yes , yes ! Stop him . Stop him . I can 't ! I can 't ! [ mumbling , incoherent speech in James ' head ] [ Rowena ] I don 't believe it ! I know the room . Every last detail . There 's a chest of drawers in the corner , isn 't there ? A chest of drawers ... A chest of drawers ... Top drawers open . Handle 's half off . On the top a bottle of milk , quarter full , gone bad . Pot of jam . Knife , plate , orange peel . Box of ammunition . Bed has a faded blue coverlet . Some newspapers on the top . Under the bed a wooden box . ln it , two brushes , empty whiskey bottle . A photograph of Mary Bridgwood . Mary . Mind your fingers on the bits of glass . My room . [ laughs manically ] Now when , exactly , did all this happen ? Two days ago . We thought we should come and see you as soon as possible . - Yes . Any headaches ? - No . At least not since ... - Loss of appetite ? - No . Anything else , disturbing ? No . Last night . It 's not important . No , nothing . Yes well , it 's really too soon . You 'd better come and see me in a fortnight . My secretary will arrange a time . Is there nothing you can do now ? Yes , I shall give him some pills . Pills ? You must appreciate your husband 's case , it 's most unusual . Is it ? What does that mean ? Nothing , Dr. Goddard . I 'm sorry . It 's just that I couldn 't help noticing how full your waiting room is . Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . I thought you 'd finished . We had . Good day , Mrs. Hale . Mr. Hale . Come on , Rowena . I wonder if I could have your opinion on this one , sir . Young man aged 22 , picked up his mother six months ago . Now he feels inhibited with members of the opposite sex . - I 'm sorry , sir ? - This can 't go on , Jenkins . The Public are beginning to ask questions , and rightly because we can 't cure them . How do we cope with a nation of bi-sexuals ? Because that 's what they 're going to be if this goes on much longer . Bi-sexuals . Homosexuals , surely , sir , to be more specific . Queers then ! Damned Government ! I warned them about allowing intersex Contact . Jumbling up mothers and sons , fathers and ... and grandmas . It 's immoral . But the Government wouldn 't listen . - I wrote articles , damn it . - Yes , sir , I read them . And it 's not just these sexual traumas we 're getting as you very well know . Take that couple in here just now . Man 's got landed with some neurotic fellow . Two totally incompatible personalities . I mean , what are we going to end up with ? A nation of schizophrenics , sir . [ mechanical whirring ] It 's lovely , Henry . Thank you . They 'll be thrilled with it . When they get a little older . Right , well , since you 've dragged me all the way from Manchester let 's get to the real problem , shall we ? It 's so difficult to know where to begin . It 's been four weeks now . At first we were both intrigued , finding out the kind of person Patrick had been . The tricks he 's played on people and the lies he 's told . And James was quite objective about all this ? Oh , yes , in fact most of the time we just laughed , he was so awful . Then I noticed that James was lying to me . Small things , but I 've had the most awful time getting him to own up . What else ? Well , he 's got very careless with money . You know , bills unpaid . I think he 's getting unpopular at work . And he 's completely lost interest in the twins . Apparently they remind the- - the Patrick part of his own ghastly childhood . You must simply send him off to one of these adjustment clinics , that 's all . We 've been . He 's supposed to go every week . He says he does . But I know for a fact he doesn 't turn up . What do they say at the clinic ? Nothing . They don 't care . They 're hopelessly overworked . Contact 's gone wrong , and the sooner we face up to it , and stop pretending it 's all lovely , the better . I agree , there 's trouble with it . ln fact , I 've had several odd cases at my factory recently . Well , it may sound mad , but I 'm sure we were happier before it . Oh , I wouldn 't go so far as that , Rowena . No , no , the pity of it is they haven 't found a way of expunging people after they 've come over . Nothing would ever shift Patrick . I hate him . He 's a coward . And now he 's got someone to hide behind he 's so cocksure of himself . He makes James say the most appalling things . And what can you tell people ? It 's got to the point where we can 't go out . And what about you and James ? Together , as it were ? What do you mean together ? I mean your sex life . Oh . Has it changed ? Have you noticed any difference in James ? Well , have you ? Yes , I have . Oh , like the other things , it was a while before we noticed it . - But now ... - Well ? James and I , we were always happy enough in bed before . Nothing very adventurous , mind you . James was never the type to be premeditated or calculating about a thing like sex . And now you 've found out how much you were missing ? It may have been your influence , but I often used to think a little more variety might be rather fun . [ chuckling ] It isn 't . It isn 't even exciting . Just rather crude . And it embarrasses poor James terribly , afterwards . Yes , I suppose it would . You know , there 's another odd thing too . There 's this woman . Mary someone , friend of Patrick 's . James says he 's only met her once , but she 's beginning to crop up in our conversations . That 's not good at all , is it ? He 's coming in . Now , Henry please be careful . He must not know we 've been talking behind his back . Don 't you worry . I can handle him . But there 's no point pretending it 's not happening , Rowena . This thing 's got to be face squarely . Now for a start . Sit down and relax . That 's it . - Henry . - Hello , James . No one told me you were coming . Well I came down on business , old chap , and thought I 'd pop in . She didn 't send for you ? No . Why should she ? I 've just told you- - Never mind . I 'll get you a drink . - Same as usual ? - Yes , thank you . - How 's Cynthia ? - Fine . - The kids ? - They 're fine . Good . I hope you 're staying overnight ? Well , I don 't know if I should . You must . We haven 't seen you for so long . A lot to talk about . All right , James . I will stay . Good . Sit down , make yourself at home . Thanks very much . - I 've just been hearing about- - - Have you ? I was just telling Henry- - Of course you were . It 's right that you should . I don 't mind . Well , I think the best thing we can do is to talk about this frankly and openly . And that 's why you 're here . All right . I 'm prepared to admit it . Good . Just as long as we know where we stand , Henry . Darling . - Well , now ... - First of all , I 'd like to say I 'm sorry- - Why ? Ever since I decided to do this experiment , everybody seems to think I need pity . Experiment ? What are you talking about ? Didn 't she tell you ? No , I was under the impression- - Let 's get this straight right away . What happened in George 's Bar that night was no accident . I 'd been planning it for a long time . It was a matter of selecting the right person that 's all . Where are you going ? I 've some things to do in the kitchen . No , I want you to stay here and listen to me . I can 't have you going around giving people the wrong impression of me , Rowena . Come on , I said sit down ! No , you see , Henry . I find it fascinating that for centuries man has had to live with the fear of death . And then suddenly , through some chance doodling with printed molecule circuits , we find the key to everlasting life . The most staggering about-face in man 's history . And what happens ? We all run off like sheep for the treatment and then sit back in utter complacency , too unthinking or too nervous to examine the implications , to ask questions . Well , I couldn 't agree with you there . Plenty of people doing research on the subject . And I want to be one of them . I made Contact with Patrick , because I wanted to find out what happened when two personalities , diametrically opposed , came together under the same dome . All right , but how did you know he was going to put a bullet through his head ? That was pretty convenient , wasn 't it ? I agree . But I knew I 'd get him sooner or later . It just happened to be sooner . Well all I can say is , James , it was damned irresponsible of you . What about your family ? Rowena and the kids ? Rowena backed me up all along . Didn 't you , darling ? - What ? - Tell him . Yes , darling , of course I did . Well , she may have . But I certainly didn 't . And as your other Contact , I should have been told . Supposing you two had an accident . What then ? A fine mess I 'd be landed with . Is that all you can think of ? What happens to you ? ln this case , yes . Look , already this year , Contact has lifted misery from millions of people , the old , the lonely , not to mention you , Henry . But we still don 't know anything about it . Someone 's got to take a chance . Fair enough . Only don 't let it be me . At least , not without asking , that 's all I 'm saying . I 've got a wife and four kids to consider . I know , Henry . If you haven 't got the stomach for it , you know what you can do , don 't you ? Very well , James . If that 's what you want . - No Henry , please . - I 'm sorry , Rowena . Henry , it isn 't him speaking . [ cackles ] From the first time I met you , I found you pompous , boring and limited . And the prospect of seeing life through your eyes has long since filled me with the utmost dismay . You see ? Quite impossible . Any time you want to bring the twins up , you know Cynthia and l- - Yes , thank you , Henry . And , of course , it 's only him I 'll be expunging . Not you . - Goodbye , James . - Goodbye , Henry . [ door opens ] James . He thinks I need him . He thinks I can 't get other Contacts . [ chuckling ] That 's , too bad . One thing to be said for Jimmy Hale , he 's never been short of friends . Thanks , George . Have one yourself , will you . That 's very kind of you , sir . I 'll have a sparkling soda . [ laughing ] - There you are . - Thank you , Sam . - Cheers . - Cheers . - Evening , George . - Evening , Mr. Hale . - Same as usual ? - Yes , please . - Thank you , sir . - Thank you . [ tell rings ] - Hello . - Hello . - You heard what happened ? - Yes . That 's right , you 're the one who got settled with that nut case Patrick Wilson . - Mary- - - Oh Sam , please . He was very fond of you , did you know that ? ln fact , he 's forgiven you . He 's forgiven her ? He has some pretty harsh thoughts on Sam here , though . What do you mean ? What sort of thoughts ? [ chuckling ] Well , go on , what sort of thoughts ? Sam , do you mind if I talk to Mr. Hale alone ? - What ? - Please . It won 't take long . All right . Are you going to marry him ? It 's not important . You must forgive me , Mr Hale . I know it sounds ridiculous but , I don 't really know who I 'm talking to . Yes , I see your point . You have me at a disadvantage . I mean , we 're virtually strangers and yet I ... I feel you seem to know so much about me . Intimate things . You 're right , I do . - It 's very disconcerting . - Must be . Well , for that reason , I think it would be better if we didn 't meet again . I mean , you 've got your life to lead . Your wife and family- - Did you love him ? He really would like to know . - I 'd rather not talk about it . - No . But you can 't be too easy with him while I 'm around , can you ? - What exactly do you mean ? - You feel guilty about me . - You feel you owe me something . - Certainly not . That 's absolute nonsense . I went out of my way to warn you . Even so . Look , you must realise it 's very difficult for me at the moment . - I 'm sorry . - I 've still got Contact with my wife but my other Contact , her brother , well with things as they were , I had to expunge him . Otherwise it wouldn 't have been fair . Now this leaves me short of cover . If anything happens to me and my wife together ... - You 're asking me to- - - Why not ? Look , I tried to explain . I took on Patrick as an experiment . I don 't believe any man should be so lonely . - You 're out of your mind . - You owe it to me , Mary . - Please , let go . - Why ? - You shut up . - What did he say ? Go away . Having a little trouble , are we , sir ? I 'm sorry . Get me another drink , George , please . - One for these kind people . - We 're not staying here . No , I really am sorry . Will you forgive me ? Example of the sort of tricks he gets up to . You rat . She doesn 't want you . From now on we 're sticking to my friends like George here . He 'll take us on if we ask him nicely , won 't you , George ? - Me , sir ? - That 's what barmen are for , take on people 's troubles . Isn 't that right , George ? I 'd have to think about it , sir . No good . It 's got to be now . We 're friends , aren 't we ? Remember the old days before I was married , before Contact . - Yes , sir , but- - - Just to tide me over , George . - No , sir . - [ shouting ] I 'm asking you , George . [ glasses shattering ] We 'd better get the police . Why 's everybody frightened of me ? Have I got a disease or something ? I 'm Jimmy Hale . You all know me . I wouldn 't hurt a fly . If a chap 's in trouble , I 'll help him . I won 't stand by ... Why doesn 't somebody help me for a change ? I 'm back , Mrs. Allan . Thank you . Mrs. Allan ? Hello , shouldn 't you be working ? I took the day off . - You 're not feeling ill , are you ? - No , I 'm all right . Mrs. Allan was sitting in for me . I sent her away . Don 't worry , the twins are asleep . Darling , why are you unpacking my suitcase ? You do remember I 'm supposed to be flying out to Manchester this evening . Not now . Don 't be silly . Cynthia and Henry are expecting me . No , I telephoned them . Darling . You wanted me to go . We discussed it . You wanted Henry to take you back , until you could persuade one of your friends . I was to go up there with the twins and talk him around . I just don 't want you to leave me , that 's all . Don 't be silly . Of course I 'm not going to leave you . Things are getting better all the time . Dr. Goddard at the clinic said so . Oh , James . And I can feel it myself . Just as long as you stay here . We don 't need Henry . We don 't need anyone , you and I. Just as long as we take care and avoid stupid risks like flying up to Manchester in the middle of the night . Take a lesson from that air crash in Canada last week . They still don 't know how many passengers were covered . It means I 'll have to give up my job of course , but I don 't mind . The twins can grow up here . We 've got plenty of food . Books and television for their education . They won 't want for anything . And as soon as they 're old enough , they can arrange their own contact . They 'll come for us , of course . People from the welfare . The men from the Adjustment clinic . But we 'll be ready for them . We won 't let them harm us . No more risks . No more danger . We 're safe . Safe . Safe . Safe .

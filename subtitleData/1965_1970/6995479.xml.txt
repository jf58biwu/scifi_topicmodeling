 Miguel ! Miguel ! Miguel . Miguel . Gwangi . No , no . Leave it . He who takes from Gwangi , the evil one , is cursed . Only by an old woman 's tongue . If he does not go back to the Forbidden Valley , we shall all suffer ! My eyes are blind , but I see the signs ! Keep your superstitions to yourself ! Fool ! Hah ! One day he will learn to obey the law of Gwangi , or , like his brother , he will perish ! Howdy , ma 'am . ¡ Pasa , señorita . / ¡ Carry your case , señor ? Eh , don 't bother me , boy . Don 't you need a guide ? No , I don 't need a guide . - An interpreter ? - No . You need a horse , señor . I don 't need anything . Now get lost , ¡ comprende ? / ¡ There is no money in that , señor . You want to do something ? If there 's money . Tell me where the arena is . 2 miles away . 2 miles ? You need that horse and a guide . You 're a real hustler , ¡ Chico . / ¡ I 'll bet pappy sends you out while he takes a siesta . No , señor . My papa is dead . I run my own business . My name is Lope . Ok , Lope , you and me will do some business together . Now , how about that horse ? 10 pesos , señor . And five more for the saddle . The first million is always the toughest , Lope . Woo ! Woo ! Eeyah ! Aah ! Yah ! Ladies and gentlemen , I now have the honor to present the lovely and talented star of our show , riding wonder horse Omar , Miss T.J. Breckenridge . - Well , I 'll be . - Hey , Tuck ! Tuck Kirby ! - Hi there What in the name of Sam Hill brings you around here ? Up to no good . You don 't seem glad to see me , Champ . Like a dying mule seeing a vulture . I 'm no vulture , bird on the wing , maybe . Flying to the next quick buck . Looks like you finally made it . Yeah , I 'm making out alright . All you care about is yourself . I still care about T.J. You fuss like a mother hen . Her daddy was my friend . Somebody 's got to protect her from guys running out like you . You weren 't sorry I left . Nope . But it nearly broke T.J. ' s heart . I hear you 're not doing so good by her , either . Haven 't been enough customers . We don 't need any big shot telling us about the show . Why don 't you just go back ... Wait a minute . That 's her tune . That 's the grand finale , right ? Well , I 'm surprised you remembered . Excuse me . I 've got to see this , for old times ' sake , you understand ? Carlos . Hurry up with that ramp . Howdy there , partner . Ex-partner . To what do we owe this unpleasant surprise ? I 'm just looking around . Trouble comes in threes . I wonder what the next two are . Hey , you can 't go in there . Get out ! It 's been a long time , T.J. Do you want to get killed ? You 're the one who 's always trying it out there . Don 't start that . We are going to have a quiet talk , or you 'll be across my knee . Fat chance . This is T.J. , remember ? Sure , I remember . If you don 't mind , I 'd like to change . Well , go on . Go ahead ! You hesitated before the jump . Seeing you would upset your own mother . You 're not pulling much of a crowd , are you ? In Villarosa , things will be better . You sure ? Sure , I 'm sure . Why is that ? What do you care ? You 've got your business . Yep , that 's right . One-man operation . Sitting in a plushy office , buying and selling acts instead of getting knocked off horses . It 's less risk and more pay . So mind your own business . I 'm doing just that . I 've got a deal to get you off the hook here . If you 've got a brain , you 'll take it . Thanks . Buffalo Bill wants to buy Omar the wonder horse . He 's offering a good price . And you get 10 % , right ? 20 . You 're not getting one thin dime out of me . And Buffalo Bill is not getting Omar . And you can 't come busting in here like some hick-town horse dealer trying to ruin my show . People depend on me , Champ , Carlos , Rowdy . But then you wouldn 't know anything about loyalty , would you ? This is business . You play con tricks , and I 'll stick to horse tricks . Now , beat it ! My , my , you always did look sweet in a temper . Get out I said ! I 've got hotter irons in the fire , honey . Just keep struggling along leaping off platforms . Go ahead break your neck if you want to . Makes no difference to me . Good . Just worried about that horse . Wouldn 't want him hurt . Ooh ! Excuse me . Good for you . You should have thrown him out a long time ago . I say ! Hello there ! Over here , sir . Someone you know ? A client of mine . Professor Bromley . What 's he doing out there ? He digs for old bones and things . Hello ! Sounds like he 's in trouble . I say , thank heavens you came along . What has happened , Professor ? What has happened ? You know very well what has happened . Rosita ? Rosita , my mule , refused to budge . Then she kicked me . I don 't know where she 's gone now . Are you hurt ? Well , there are no bones broken , but it 's frightfully painful . By the way , I don 't believe we 've met . My name 's Bromley . Hi . Name 's Tuck Kirby . Hop on . We 'll give you a ride back . Perhaps Lope 's mount might be a little more practical . Wait ! Whoa . My boy . Come on ! You ought to know better than to get behind a stubborn mule , Professor . Your advice comes a little late , Kirby . Look , Professor . Rosita has found her way home ! Vicious beast . Give me your shoulder , Lope . I 'd say you could use a good stiff drink . You 're right . It 's in the trunk . Lope tells me you 're one of these , uh , one of these archaeologist fellows . He 's pretty near the mark . Actually , I 'm a paleontologist . Oh . We dig deeper . It isn 't good to dig up the past . Let sleeping dogs lie , eh ? We won 't get very far that way . Depends on where you want to get to . To the bottom of things . What Darwin did with his theory of evolution , I intend to do with my theory of humanoids . Humanoids ? It means manlike . Paleontologists generally believe that man first evolved about a million years ago . I 'll prove it was many eons before that . If you 'd like to look in that trunk , you 'll find a piece of rock . Will you get it ? That 's it ? Now look at the fossil , the impression left in the rock . Looks like a footprint . Precisely . It 's an Eohippus ! Eo ... Eohippus . The so-called dawn horse , the ancestor of our present day horses . I never saw a horse small enough to leave a print like that . You notice it had three toes ? Through evolution , horses have grown larger . That center toe has become the hoof . ¡ ¡ Increible ! / ¡ ¡ Si , increible . / ¡ what is more incredible is the fossil beside it . I 'm convinced that is the tibia of some humanoid that existed at the same time as the Eohippus , possibly more than 50 million years ago . You found this thing around here ? In the foothills . This is my whole life , Mr. Kirby , but I need time and money . My resources , both financial and physical , are running precariously low . Well , Professor , what you need is a good rest . Yes , Mr. Kirby . Thank you for your kindness . Lope . I 'll bet you didn 't know that was your middle toe , did you ? T.J. Yeah ? Can I speak to you a moment ? Of course . In private . I know . You want that money I owe you . Don 't worry . We 'll pack them in with our new attraction . El Diablo will be successful . Shh . Quiet . It 's not only money . What else ? Us together . You and me and El Diablo ... In the mean time , let 's see how it goes . Hiyah ! ¡ ¡ Toro ! / ¡ Ha ha ha ! Hiyah ! ¡ ¡ Toro ! / ¡ Hi there , hon ! I thought I told you to go . About that deal . So go ! I guess you 've been thinking about it . Nothing is further from my mind , except you . Hey , ¡ toro ! / ¡ Hey , ¡ toro ! / ¡ Hey , ¡ toro ! / ¡ Lope ! Hey , ¡ toro ! / ¡ Hey , hey , ¡ toro ! / ¡ Tuck ! Darling , are you alright ? Cut it out , Tuck , if you want to get repaired . It 's not easy to keep still with you hanging around me like that . Who was that fellow who jumped the bull ? Oh , Carlos . I 'm glad he was there . He saved your life . Why did you walk out on me , Tuck ? I was ready to sell out , to marry you . That 's all I ever wanted . I don 't know . I didn 't want to . Getting married is like being a horse tied up in a corral . I never could take being all roped up . T.J. , you know what ? I just know you 're going to sell me Omar . Hmm ? That 's right . You 've got a deal . Wait a minute . What 's going on ? Nothing . Anything for you , baby . Don 't give me that baby stuff . Carlos brought me a new act . What kind ? Come to the opening at Villarosa . No , no , I mean now . Alright . I 'll show you tonight . But first , the patient must rest , or he might have a relapse , and relapses can be fatal . T.J. , I ... Now lie still . Doesn 't it hurt to move ? Terrible . Meet El Diablo . Well , if that don 't beat all . You want a little sugar , don 't you ? Where 'd you ever get this critter ? Carlos found him . He must have been in a gold mine . It took a while to train him , but he 's ready to debut . What 's the act ? We strap a platform onto Omar 's back . El Diablo waltzes on top . A horse dancing on horseback . That 's got to be a humdinger . I can see it all now . Presenting El Diablo , the world 's one and only miniature horse . We are on our way to a fortune . Amazing . It 's absolutely astounding . It was those three toes that started me thinking . And four on its hind feet . Great Scott , it could be ... an Eo ... what 's it ? Hippus . Eohippus , yes . Eohippus , if you are one ... What are you doing here over 50 million years after you should be extinct ? It could be a freak of nature . Is there any way to tell ? By checking its origin . If I could prove this is the genuine article , I shall receive a knighthood for the greatest scientific discovery of the age . The greatest scientific discovery of the age ? T.J. Doesn 't know what she 's got . Sir Horace Bromley . It 'll look great in lights . Buffalo Bill , Barnum Bailey . Galileo , Newton , and Bromley ... Or the Ringling Brothers ... we 'll play one off against the other , sell to the highest bidder . Possibly ¡ Lord / ¡ Bromley . We 'd make a killing . We must find out where this little horse came from . Let 's find this guy Carlos . Impossible . My dear fellow , I have no commercial interest in El Diablo . I 'm a scientist . I don 't care what you are . T.J. Has given away our secret , destroying all my dreams . Be reasonable . My people do not understand reason . That witch Tia Zorina speaks nonsense about El Diablo . They believe it . You could show us the camp . You 've caused enough trouble already . Well , thanks for your help , Carlos . - What help ? - Tia Zorina . Camp . We can sure find that camp . - How ? - Why , Lope . Lope ? Sure . That kid could find a needle in a haystack and sell it for a profit . ¡ ¡ Ole ! / ¡ ¡ ¡ Ole ! ¡ Ole ! / ¡ Madam , I am prepared to pay a guide handsomely . To lead you to the Forbidden Valley ? No ! Not for all the gold in the world . What is this Forbidden Valley ? From there came the little horse . And until he is returned , a great evil will fall upon us . Rubbish ! Unless the horse is returned , we shall all suffer the curse of hell . Superstitious claptrap . There 's nothing hocus-pocus about that little horse . Don 't you realize we 've discovered a living specimen of the eohippus ? You mean that thing really is an eohippus ? Of course . Well , naturally we shall have to prove it by scientific research . Well , we aren 't getting any scientific research done here , are we , Professor ? Uh , if you can 't help me , perhaps I can help you . If you knew where the little horse was hidden , what would you do ? Return it to the Forbidden Valley . Well ... A centavo for your thoughts , señor . Oh , hiya , Lope . ¡ Limonada , por favor . / ¡ You look unhappy , señor . I 've got a problem , Lope . I 've been wrestling with it for hours . Sometimes it helps to tell an amigo . Well , it 's like this , amigo . I made a big discovery last night , and if I tell this friend about it , she could make a fortune . But if she makes a fortune , it might not help me . I can 't figure why I 'm helping her make a fortune when I could just be quiet and make a fortune myself . Savvy ? I savvy very well . I can 't understand it . Love . Love 's for latins . My mama used to tell me , " when you help someone you love , you help yourself . " Here . ¡ Limonada . / ¡ ¡ For free advice . / ¡ ¡ Muchas gracias . / ¡ ¡ De nada . / ¡ You sure know how to help yourself , Lope . What 's the big discovery , señor ? No , no . You 'll want a cut . Why ? I 'm doing fine alone . I see . Widening your horizons . Sorry , señor ? You 're going on a journey . With the Professor . With the Professor ? I must meet him tonight , with the mule , outside the arena . Well , that 's it , amigo . No more figuring . I think my friend needs help right now . Ha ha ha ! Ah . ¡ Si , si , si . / ¡ ¡ ¡ Vamos ! / ¡ Come on , come on . Aie . Hey , Tuck ! Tuck , what 's the hurry ? Lope , come here . We are in luck , Chico . They 've got it . Kirby , let them go ! Don 't be a fool , man ! Come on . We mustn 't lose them . What happened ? He hit me . Who ? Your friend Kirby . What ? I caught him and others stealing El Diablo . Stealing ? Why , the dirty ... No , not Tuck . We just saw him with our own eyes . He 's no good , T.J. Champ , get Bean and Rowdy . You bet . Whoa ! Look here . Tuck 's got company . We 're headed in the right direction . He 's working with the Professor . He was speaking of scientific interests . Tuck wants El Diablo for Buffalo Bill . You should have listened to me . He 's right , T.J. That Tuck is the lowest . All right , all right . He was right . I was wrong . If we stand here , we 'll never catch him . I know where they 're heading . There 's a shortcut to Forbidden Valley . Help ! Professor , where is that little horse ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? Alright , sir Horace , when your King finds out you 're a horse thief , he 'll sure give you a touch of the sword ... There ! Tell me where El Diablo is . You can make it easy or hard on yourself . The gypsies took him . You put them up to it ! Yes , in a way , but it will benefit us all . Now , is that a fact ? El Diablo ... Is the property of T.J. Breckenridge ! I 'm protecting her interests . Well , so am I. Don 't you see ? We must follow the gypsy trail to the Forbidden Valley because where there 's one eohippus , there must be others . At least two , the sire and the mare , possibly more . Just think what you and Miss Breckenridge could do with a dozen Eohippi . From now on , we 're partners ? Oh , no , Professor . As a rule , I never shake hands with an anxious man . I 'll join you , but no deals . Señor Kirby ! Hey . Hi there , Lope . Say , what 's the price of water around here ? One peso . To you , half . Okay . Fly , little one . Fly home to your master . This circle of mountains , jagged peaks , steep cliffs ... Could be the perfect barrier against man and the elements . No wonder they call it the Forbidden Valley . Yes . Might be the answer to many things . Like what ? We shall soon see , Mr. Kirby . We 'll camp here and start out first thing in the morning . What 's that ? Quick ! The horses ! Where 's Rosita ? Señor Kirby , Professor . Look . There 's blood all around . Whoa ! Whoa . Yeah , the gypsies stopped here , and El Diablo ran off that way . Señor Kirby ! Professor ! Now , how 'd they get here ? I was afraid of something like this . Hey ! Champ , I caught myself a horse thief . You don 't think I had anything to do with that ? Look ! The eohippus ! Easy , easy . Stay . That 's no good . Let 's chase him on horseback . Go get him . Hey , you need any help ? Not from you . Oh ! I 've got it ! Take your thieving hands off him . He 's mine . Whatever you say , T.J. Tuck Kirby , I could shoot you . Keep after him , Champ ! Hey , we 've got him cornered . The devil we have . I can see daylight in there . He must have gone clear through . That 's that , because we 're not . Looks like the end of the road . Opens into another whole valley through there . Wide enough for the horses . Take up the slack easy . Yeah , yeah . Whoa . Take her away . Hyah ! Hyah ! Ok . That did it . Come on , boys . Now , ain 't that something ? Man , oh , man . Hello ! Oh ! Help ! Giddup ! Whoa ! Here , what 's this ? I never saw tracks like that . Hey , Champ . Do you see what I see ? Holy ... what 's that ? It looks like a plucked ostrich . Let 's get him for the show . What the ... I 'm going to try and find the others . Right . - It 's hideous . - It 's beautiful . What kind of bird is it ? No bird . A giant pterodactyl , a flying reptile . It 's been extinct for over 50 million years . Then what 's it doing here ? Precisely . What is it doing here ? Where are the others ? Back there . Let 's get out of here ! Gwangi ! Take off , T.J. Lope is hurt . - Can you ride ? ¡ - Si , señor . / ¡ Come on , Professor . I can 't go now . A big lizard 's heading this way . Now get aboard ! Leave me alone , Mr. Kirby . I 'm not leaving now . Come on , Tuck ! Ok , professor . It 's your funeral . Great Scott . I see what you mean , Mr. Kirby . Oh , by George . A Styracosaurus . Whoa ! Alright , Champ . Take a look . Hyah . Hey . Okay up here . Room for the horses and everything . Let 's get up there . What about the Professor ? Nothing we can do . Just hope he 's alive . Rowdy , you must be plumb loco . - Now what did I do ? - Come here . These cartridges are the blanks we use in the show . No wonder the rifles didn 't do any good . How was I to know ? Hey , forget it . Here . Maybe we can use these . Can you cut that into a spear ? I don 't take orders from no horse thief . Now tell me . Just what do you mean , " horse thief " ? Break it up ! That 's enough . We 'll settle this later . No . We 'll settle it now . Lope . It was the Professor and the gypsies . Carlos said you did it . Carlos . You never did bring anything but trouble to T.J. Alright . Stop it . Where do you think you are ? Civilization ? We 've got to stick together until we get out of this . In all my travels , I never saw nothing like that 2-ton lizard . If we could just get him back alive . The only thing I 'm getting back alive is me . That does it . Why aren 't you in the cave ? You want to get yourself killed ? Not anymore . What 's that for ? That 's a trap ... In case one of those little lizards decides to mosey up this way . A hole in the ground could swallow me up , too . Can 't tell a friend from an enemy . Cockeyed female . Don 't they sleep nights ? Come on , come on ! It 's gone . Yeah , temporarily . Tuck , I 've decided . I 'm going to sell out . Great , if we ever get back to Omar . Not just Omar . The whole show , lock , stock , and barrel . That 's what you wanted , isn 't it ? Well , sure . Sure . Oh , sound happier . I don 't know , T.J. I 've been on my own so long ... I 've been on my own , too . But not like me . I mean really on my own . I had to con my way to where I am . Tuck , I don 't care . Don 't you understand ? Alright . Alright , T.J. I 'll tell you . I 've been looking for something all of my life . Yes . It took a lot of finding , but I 've finally found it . The most beautiful , goldarnedest ranch you ever saw . Ranch ? Yeah . In Wyoming . Don 't you see ? We could both sell out , buy the place , raise lots of cattle and horses . And kids , maybe ? Yeah . You ... Talking about settling down ? Sure you can make it , Tuck ? Well , I won 't know till I give it a try , will I ? Bean ! Rowdy ! Bring torches ! It worked ! I say up there . Watch your step . There seems to be a bit of a drop here . I need some water before we set out . Be right back . You shouldn 't have let him go alone . His idea . Whoa , whoa . Ho ! Come on ! Hey , Rowdy ! The Spears ! Get the Spears ! Ha ! Ha ! Heeya ! Ya ! Ya ! Get the horses . Bean , Rowdy , saddle up . Come on , giddup ! Heeya ! Got him ! Look out ! Rowdy , the other side ! Pull on the rope ! Come on ! Pull it ! Pull that rope ! Go on ! Get clear ! Get clear ! Pull that rope ! Get clear ! Pull on that rope ! Hold him ! Hold him ! Get another rope on him ! Pull on the rope ! Hold him ! Another rope should do it ! Hold it steady ! Hold him ! Hold him ! They 've got him , Professor ! They 've got him ! Heeya ! Steady now ! Steady ! Keep the ropes tight ! Keep them tight ! Come on , Professor ! Pull the ropes ! Keep them tight ! Alright , clear out ! Let go ! Rowdy , come on ! Steady those horses ! We can 't get through ! Keep those horses steady ! Champ , Carlos ! We can 't get through here ! Go back for the Professor ! There 's no way through ! There 's no way through ! We 've got to go back ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Whoa . Ha ha ha ! We 're going to lug this critter back alive . T.J. , honey , you 're going to have the greatest main attraction that any circus ... What 's the matter ? Where 's Carlos ? Champ ! Ho ! It is as I foretold . Gwangi has killed Carlos , just as he killed his brother Miguel . Well , how did you know that ? In a dream , I saw it , the great jaws snapping , the riderless horse . He was doomed . So will you be doomed , all of you , unless the evil one is set free . Balderdash , my good woman . Balderdash . He 's no more evil than an alligator . The only thing that 's evil are his jaws . Spell ? He can cast no spells . Come on . Let 's move out . Defy the law and perish ! In the name of science , I beg you to think again . We 've got a show to do . A show ? A show ? It 's disgraceful to think of putting this fabulous creature on display in a cheap circus . Gwangi is our property . He belongs to us all , to scientific research ! Easy , Professor . Do your research while you follow us on our world tour . You must be mad , raving mad . We 'll see what the Royal Society has to say about this ! What 's all this about a world tour ? I 've got it all figured out . We play London , Paris , Madrid , and ... You 're forgetting something , aren 't you ? Oh , yes . New York . No . Wyoming . That ranch . We talked about it , remember ? Yes , but that was before . T.J. , this show was going to be it . I helped so that all of you could get paid of from a show that 's worth buying . But now it 's worth saving . We can do the tour , then buy the ranch . We can 't . Not us . Not now . Same old Tuck . Oh , no . Not the same old Tuck , but a new kind of T.J. , suddenly all caught up in the world of glitter . Leave me out . That dreamboat 's on the rocks before it sails . As you like . " As you like " ? Well , that 's it . I guess it is . Figures . Well , I 'm sorry for you , hon , because you 're heading for a place I just left . You won 't like it much . Señorita , you must go after Mr. Kirby . He 's a very proud man , and he 'll never come back . Tuck ! Back ! Back ! Quiet him down ! Quiet him down ! I 'm doing the best I can ! Back ! Back ! Pedro , ready with that fanfare music . ¡ Si , señor . / ¡ Stand by , boys . When that goes up , you 'll get the picture of your lives . Ladies and gentlemen ! I have the honor to make the most important announcement of this ... To make the most important announcement of the era ! What you are about to see has never been seen before ! I repeat ! Has never been seen before by human eyes ! Captured and brought back alive by Miss T.J. Breckenridge ... Aah ! Let her rip , boys . Gwangi the great , living wonder of the prehistoric era ! Get that curtain down ! Can you get it down ? Stop him ! Hey , what 's happening ! No , you 're supposed to play ! Champ , what 's happened ? Gwangi 's loose ! Well , get some rifles ! Aah ! Aah ! Hey ! Hey ! Heeya ! Heeya ! The doors ! The doors ! Lope ! Get in there ! Quick ! Out the back way ! I 'll lock him in ! This door 's barred from the inside ! The other is , too ! Ya ! Hiyah ! Hey ! Ha ! Ha ! Come on ! Move !

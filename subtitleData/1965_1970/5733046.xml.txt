 Battle Beneath the Earth ( 1967 ) Another hour to go . Looks like we 've drawn a quiet night . Some nut will turn up somewhere as they always do . Control to Unit 2 . Control to Unit 2 . Unit 2 , 5th and Bonanza . Go ahead , Control . A listening disturbance at South Vine and Main . Negative injuries . Investigate and report . Urgent . A what kind of disturbance ? A listening disturbance . Repeat . Listening disturbance . You 've gotta be kidding . That 's what the report reads . Investigate and report . Urgent . See ? What did I tell you ? Quiet ! You fools . What 's happening ? Listen . What 's he saying ? Over there . Look , I can 't see anything . Just like ants . They 're crawling under us , I tell you . Just like ants . - Disgraceful . Come on , Martin . - No , wait a minute . Listen . I can hear them now . Do you hear anything , lady ? What do you hear , Josie ? Must be some kind of nut . Move along , folks . Show 's over , let 's go . Move along , everybody . That 's the lot . Nothing else to see . Let 's move , lady . - Don 't shove me , you idiot . - On your way . - Damn cops . - Come along , Josie . - Police brutality . - Move along . What 's your problem , mister ? They 're all down there . Crawling about like ants . If you listen closely , you can hear them . - Drunk ? - No . You better come along with us , mister . But I tell you , they 're right beneath us . Listen . Listen . You can listen more comfortably at the station . You fools ! Don 't you know what 's happening ? Listen , for God 's sake , listen ! Tell Jonathan Shaw . Tell Jonathan Shaw . He 'll understand . Tell Jonathan Shaw . - Yeah ? - Commander Shaw , sir . Send him in . - Nice to see you , Jon . - Thank you . Sit down . - Well , you 're off the hook . - I 'm cleared ? Oh , it 's not that simple . The record still stands . That infers I 'm responsible . The board 's verdict reads , " Due to causes unknown . " Well , that 's one more reason for going back . - Sorry , can 't be done . - Why not ? Twenty-seven men died . Now , they have families . Neither you nor your underseas projects are exactly popular right now . Sealab VII was a damned good design . - Probably the best we 've built so far . - But it collapsed . Yes , under tons of rock from an undersea earthquake . Look , Jon , we 've been over and over this before . There were no traces of any tremors or quake reports . Then what happened down there ? I 'm sorry , no diving . I 'm assigning you to the test lab for a while . Then you 're knifing me too ? Oh , don 't be stupid , relax . When things quiet down , we 'll see about getting you back in the water . - This needs your okay . - Yeah , be right with you , Susan . How are the weld-verification people doing ? They 'll be ready for the immersed pressure sequences tomorrow . That 's good news . Susan , what 's wrong ? It 's my brother . More trouble ? - How bad is he ? - I don 't know . According to this , he 's getting the best of care . But it 's a state institution . Jon , he 's asking for you . Could you go see him and talk to him ? I 've tried that before . But you 're the only one he 'll listen to . Please help him . Please . Good morning , Psychiatric Department . Yes , doctor , that 's been taken care of . Dr. Galissi will be free any minute now . Thank you . Lemons . Nothing but lemons . Never mind , Mr. Sparks , you just keep right on trying . Yeah . Yeah . Sorry to keep you , commander . If you 'd step this way . - That 's a bit unusual , isn 't it ? - Compulsive gamblers . Addicts . I try to taper them off . I 'm glad you 're here , commander . I 've failed miserably . - I simply can 't get through to him . - You say that he keeps mentioning ants ? Yes , very puzzling . Is he violent ? Very . You are sure you 'll be all right ? What 's your interest in Kramer ? I know he 's an old friend ... He saved my life in Korea . - Hello , Arnold . - Jonathan . Sorry they took my chair away . That 's all right . Thanks . Why did they bring you here , Arnold ? - They arrested me . - Well , yes , I know . But why ? Why , Arnold ? They said I had a breakdown . Out there in the streets . What caused it ? You want my life 's history ? There must have been a reason . Dr. Galissi says that you talked about ants . Dr. Galissi ! That slot-machine quack . Like ants . Just like ants , you can 't stop them . Who can 't you stop ? They 're crawling in under us right now . Who knows when they will strike ? I 'm afraid I 'm not with you , Arnold . Who is ? Look at these . What are they ? Seismographic drawings of the tunnels . I see . I used my latest detection techniques . There . That 's where they 're coming in . South of San Diego . South of San Diego , yes , I see . And there along the Oregon coast . But they 're bound to reveal themselves . There 'll be an accident somewheres . Yes , an accident somewhere , of course . You 're just like the others . - You don 't believe me . - Oh , now , Arnold ... You fool ! They 're 20 years ahead of us ! They 've got tunneling machines . They 're coming in under us . - And you sit there like an idiot . - Easy ... Don 't you understand they 're after us ? They 're going to wipe us out . They 're gonna wipe us right off the map . Another double , sir ? Oh , yeah , why not ? We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin . A sudden coal-mine disaster has struck the small town of Placer , Oregon . That 's where they 're coming in . Along the Oregon coast . When the mine collapsed a few minutes after midnight . Another 300 are believed missing . We now switch you to Jack Ambridge in Placer , Oregon . This is a small backwater town near the Pacific Coast but with the deepest mines in North America . Until today , the people of Placer took pride in their mines the most modern automated mines in the world . They claimed that theirs was the safest ... They 're going to wipe us out . They 're gonna wipe us right off the map . But now disaster has struck this small town . I appreciate your help . You 'll call me . All right , thanks . Well , the Bureau of Mines people are still checking , Jon . But they don 't expect to find anything unusual . Well , what about your equipment here ? Any warning tremors recorded before the accident ? No , not a whisper . Why would the mine collapse so suddenly ? Well , they figure one of the tunnel supports went first . A mistake in engineering , faulty timbers , pilot error , who knows ? - Here 's that report you wanted , Vance . - Oh , thanks , Meg . I asked Naval Intelligence to run a computer check on the entire town , and that was asking a lot . - Naval Intelligence ? - Yeah . - Ever hear of sabotage ? - Yes , but ... Yeah , well , here we are . " Of 622 regular miners , 43 have arrest or conviction records . " " Traffic violations , drunken driving , speeding . " Nothing special , just the usual offenses . Ah , take a look at this . " Closely knit , average community indicating an unusually loyal group of citizens . " Yeah , keep reading . " This information , combined with our investigation into the accident confirms our belief that no suspicion of sabotage or other external causes exist . " Any way you look at it , Jon , there is no basis for Kramer 's story . Just another accident , like Sealab VII . Now , look , Jon , don 't try stretching coincidences too far . You might wind up in a padded cell along with Kramer . Thanks for the advice . Anytime . You got that ? Yeah . Force : 3.9 . Grid location : A90 by 44B . Depth : Sea level minus 60 . - Routine check , please . - Roger . Preparations Room , what do you read ? Location : Construction site above the King River Dam . Roger . We 've been briefed to expect high-level dynamite blasts starting today . Got that ? Thank you , Preparations Room . We 've got the entire world bugged . So it seems . Yeah , if champagne corks pop in the Kremlin , we pick it up here . I hope you 're right . This is the lower section , beneath the elevator shafts . It 's pretty dismal . This way , sir . One time this gallery looked promising but the coal seams petered out . Anybody here at the time of the cave-in ? No , they were up on Number 2 Level . Mind your head , sir . Gallery K is cleared . We 're ready to break through into the bottom shaft . Thanks , Pete . This way , commander . Cut the drill . Okay , Mac . Right , Charlie , get in with that hammer . Okay , that ought to do it . - Looks like an explosion . - Strange , this shaft 's been closed for years . - There 's another . - What is it ? Watch it ! - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Hey , you better keep close . No telling what 'll go next . What 's this ? I don 't know . We never dug through there . Perfectly cut sides . Let 's have the chisel . Commander . Look at this . I hope to hell you know what you 're talking about . I think so , sir . This is Colonel Wilson , Army Intelligence . - How do you do , sir ? - Hello . Well there 's no question about it . Your tunnel samples are a mixture of rock and soil typical of the Placer area and fused under extremely high temperatures . By some kind of tunneling machine ? It can 't be ruled out as a possibility . But that would require a fantastic amount of heat . Exactly . Such a machine is beyond our scientific knowledge at the present time . - This the medallion you told me about ? - Yes , sir . What do you make of that ? Sir , I 'm completely puzzled . Oh , excuse me , sir . Glad to see you , Arnold . How is he , doctor ? The shock treatments seem to have been effective . Thank you . I 'm sorry we can 't ask you to stay but it 's regulations . I understand . In any case , I feel safer in my own asylum . - Goodbye . - Goodbye , and thank you . So you found one of them . No , only these traces . I 've told them about your research , Arnold . They 'd like to hear more . As you all know , one of man 's dreams has been to understand and predict earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to prevent needless death and wanton tragedies . For the past seven years , I 've devoted my life and my resources to this task . But your government wouldn 't help nor would the great foundations . However , I persevered . Working alone , I designed and built extremely advanced and sensitive equipment . About six months ago while I was studying that archvillain of Japanese volcanoes , Asamayama I began to detect strange patterns of movement beneath the Earth 's surface . Do you have a chart of the Pacific here , please ? - Of course . - Thank you . Mysterious underwater sounds were creeping along beneath the ocean moving towards our coastline in a steady methodical manner unlike any natural force . I presume you charted all this ? Asamayama erupted quite suddenly . My records , my equipment , were all burnt to ashes . I only escaped with my life . That 's about the wildest yarn I 've ever heard . Is it ? As an experienced seismologist , I can assure you that what I ... Severe landslide above San Francisco reported a few minutes ago . Nothing recorded on our equipment . Get back in that mine . Take a team of men . - Find out what 's at the end of that tunnel . - Yes , sir . And , Jon , be prepared for anything . Yes , sir . This is priority , double-scramble the line . - There it is . - Move them up , sergeant . Pick it up , Grasso . What 's that ? Hold it . Sergeant . - Another set of tunnels ... - Shh ! Douse the light . Chinese . Yeah . With atom bombs . We move in ? What about the bombs ? We assume they 're not triggered . Take your men and fan out over there . - Go in when I go in . - Right . Grasso , Greenberg , Hawkins . Ready ? Let 's go . Sergeant Mulberry ? Get the disposal team . Hawkins , Greenberg , Grasso . Take two men back up the tunnel , about a hundred yards . - Take those boxes , set a barricade . - Yeah . - Come on , move it , move it . - Hey , guys . Put it right up against the wall . Come on , let 's move it , let 's move it . Come on , come on . Yes . Identical to the Mark III . Yeah , copied lock , stock and imploding pin . It 's a Mark III assembly . Disarm and destroy . And watch your step . It 's tricky . Got one . Got two . Got three . Four . Five . Got six . Hawkins . Hawkins . Move back , commander . Okay , let 's get out . - Give us five minutes . - I can 't ! Let 's move ! Number eight , sir . That machine , it 's coming back ! Come on ! Hawkins , come on . Grenades . Hit the treads with grenades . Come on , everybody out ! - See to the wounded , Chai . - Yes , general . So the Americans have discovered us ? Sooner or later , it was bound to happen . - How many bombs are still operative ? - Only two . - And your technicians ? - One survivor . I 'm sorry . - Our most valuable men . - They will be replaced . But when ? And the bombs ? - Even now , our deliveries fall far behind . - We have prepared for a long struggle . Five new atomic squadrons will be dispatched soon . And what about Peking ? The old men quake in their boots , they dare not interfere . General Chan , the advance force have bored into the Colorado caverns . - They await instructions . - Good . This is no time for a faint heart , Kengh Lee . The enemy lies naked before us , we rely on your brilliance to see us through . Hand me that fragment , Jon . Thank you . If Kramer 's right , then he 's years ahead of your entire operation here . Now , that 's not fair , sir . We were set up to detect underground explosions . - Then how do we trace the tunnels ? - I 've been talking to Dr. Kramer . He 's sketched out these new circuits . He thinks they might be the answer . What do you think , Vance ? - It 's pretty wild . - Well ? - Hell , it 's worth a try . - Okay , get started . Admiral ? It 's a laser drill , all right . As I feared . Admiral , this multiple drilling head can cut through steel concrete , rock , anything , just like that . Fantastic . Oh , they 're on the ball , all right , colonel . While we 've been wasting billions up there they 've been working down there where it counts . Can we duplicate this laser ? - Given time , it 's a possibility . - How much time ? I don 't know . These spectroanalyses reveal exotic alloys that we don 't have . It 's as simple as that . I 've talked to Caltech . They 've got their top lab men standing by . - What about Professor Kebner ? - I 've tracked him down , sir . In Chicago . - Fly him out to the coast . - Yes , sir . Get the air base , Flight Control . You 're on the line , sir . Flight Control ? This is Hillebrand . I have VIPs flying to Los Angeles , top priority and utmost urgency . Negate the weather . Right . The plane will be waiting . Right , I 'll get my gear . Go with him . Guard him . Don 't let him out of your sight . Yes , admiral . Jon ? Reactivate your combat team . Get reinforcements and get back in that tunnel . Fight , hold out , sabotage and do anything to delay them until we 're ready . Yes , sir . Get back , Grasso , we 're picking up your grease gun . Nothing . Okay . Pack it up . Yes ? Ah . General , they are back . - How many men ? - We await further reports . A determined enemy , no doubt . You have reinforced the listening posts ? Yes , general . And the bomb room ? It 's been abandoned to avoid further attacks . New staging areas have been prepared . Logical . Very logical . I thought so . And so will the Americans . My dear Chai , when will you learn that logic is the American god ? Without logic , we cannot function . Military routine clouds your brain . Now is the time for something ... But , general ... Do not concern yourself . Just keep me informed . I shall be at the advance supply depot . Oh , admiral ? Low-frequency signal is just coming in . " No contact . Proceeding in . Shaw . " Acknowledge , sir ? Acknowledge . Ah , general , you do us a great honor . Production has started , I see ? On schedule . Even the emergency oxygen is being processed . Provisions for the Colorado force ? En route . This location is perfect . It abounds with every type of raw material . - Sufficient for our needs ? - Oh , yes . Very soon now , we shall be independent of the mainland . Good . Ah , yes , the Hydrosonic Farm Project . An experiment in forced growth under solaric light . A pleasant flavor ? Each tiny plant contains the entire spectrum of vitamins needed to sustain the human body . You have planned well , Kengh Lee . Very well indeed . One more item of interest . Pure gold . Enough to support our needs for years to come . I know , Pasadena , but this is an emergency . Hello ? Yes . Hold on , please . He 's on the line , sir . Phone 3 . Hello , Dr. Kramer . Admiral Hillebrand here . How 's it going ? Just a second . It looks good . The metal problems are nearly solved and we 've started on the machine . Well , how long will that take ? I can 't tell . We 're working three shifts now . Well , you must have some idea . It 's impossible to predict . Don 't push me , admiral . I 'm thinking what can happen if we don 't get your machine . I know , but I can 't work miracles . I think you can , doctor , and we 're counting on you to do so . The admiral ? It 's funny . For years they 've ignored me , and now they expect the impossible . It 's Commander Cassidy , sir . He 's got the detector working . Well , admiral , we 've filled in Kramer 's blanks . We can pick up any sound now . Watch this . Great . - Yeah , but we 're still in trouble . - Well , how come ? Do you realize the fantastic amount of activity that goes on in this country ? Heavy construction , mining , digging , dynamiting . All around us , 24 hours a day . And you can 't isolate the sounds ? No , and it 's driving our computer crazy . Oh , it starts off normally enough . Now watch what happens . Yeah , I see what you mean . No matter how hard it tries , it can 't perform its mission . Kramer 's original research took place in unpopulated areas . A factor we didn 't consider . It has me baffled . Completely baffled . This way . Yes ? Ah . Good . Our plan works , they have taken the left fork . You see , Kengh Lee , you worry needlessly . One can always rely on the Americans to be completely logical . - Your preparations are complete ? - Yes , general . All is in readiness . It 's getting hotter . Hey , commander . Cover us . Dummies ! Hey , commander . Greenberg . Gloves . They 're inside . - Radioactive waste . - It 's a trap . - Everybody out . On the double . - Come on ! - Let 's get the hell out of here ! - Come on , everybody out ! Message coming through . Emergency transmission , direct voice . Can 't make it out . It 's a weak signal . Hang on a minute . There 's too much interference . Quiet ! Everybody quiet ! Calling ADC . Calling ADC . Come in , ADC . Come in , ADC . Come in , Uncle John . We have you but can 't read you . Repeat . We have you but can 't read you . Column 9 has been ambushed . Column 9 , ambushed . We are ... Sorry , admiral . It 's fine . Any luck ? The battery 's dead . Wilson ? When we tried to pick up Shaw 's message , what interfered at this end ? Well , the background noise in this room , sir . And what stopped it ? Well , you did , sir . You told them all to be quiet . Exactly . And that 's the answer . Cassidy ? - Sir ? - Here . Chinese . We 'll have to move on . Come on . Yeah ? All right . Then the time 's final . Starting this afternoon , at 1400 Zulu , agreed ? Well , that 's it . Everything 's set . From here on in , it 's up to your machines , Cassidy . They have their chance now . Yes , sir . Attention . Attention , all miners . All mining operations in all shafts suspended . Repeat . All operations are suspended . All shafts are closed . We regret to announce that all flights have been postponed . Repeat . All flights have been postponed until further notice . Please check with your ticket counter . Repeat . Please check with your ticket counter . California reports Condition Silent now in force . Mississippi calling . All stopped . Roger , Colorado . Good work . Colorado found the trouble . They 're going off now . Can we hear from Vermont and Texas ? What 's the delay ? Vermont 's on the line . They 've located the quarry blasting . - Expect to go silent in 10 minutes . - Good . - Texas . Let 's hear from Texas . - No response . - Try them again . - Okay . All right , Vance , get your machines working . - We 'll handle Texas . - Sir . - What 's holding them up ? - You know Texas . They 're through on my line . They claim they shut down over two hours ago . Texas . It looks good . Very good . Are you picking up the tunnels ? Yeah . This is it . Switch over to visual on the big board up above . It 's working . There 's the first report . Near Phoenix . Let 's have an evaluation . Underground noise moving east . Direction : 070 . Estimated speed : Eight miles per hour . One of their tunnel borers . - Or a bomb trailer moving through . - Mm . My God , they 're everywhere . So our Commander Shaw has escaped . Yes , general . But many Americans were killed . All senseless deaths without Shaw . I wonder which gods protect him so . - The Placer mine ? - All entrances have been sealed off . At least we have closed the barn doors . " The barn doors " ? Oh , do not bother yourself . An American expression . I shall be with Dr. Kengh Lee at the advance base . You know , in a way , we 've gotta hand it to them . They 've completely undercut our military power . - Yes , and created a stalemate . - That 's right . Well , you can see what they 've done . Three separate tunnel complexes . The first , running into Texas under our space center and the big aircraft plants . Second , cutting through our population centers . And the third , snaking north under our missile sites . And the big Air Defense Command Center that cost a billion dollars to carve into the rocks . And they 're just sitting there waiting to press the button . And if we don 't find an answer soon , we can write off the entire country . Brandy ? Courvoisier in coffee ? Why not ? You know perhaps it 's a mistake to assume that they already have the bombs . That 's one hell of an assumption . Yeah , but suppose the bombs we 've already destroyed were the heart of their offensive . Well , they 'd be desperate to get replacements back into the tunnels . Yeah , and forget our dangers for a moment . Put yourself in their position . Consider their lifeline . One long slender thread under the Pacific . That could be their big mistake . You all right , Jon ? Rough ? We lost most of the team . I 'm sorry . What you say about their supply line is exactly what we 've been working on . Now , this report , just received from Hawaii reveals the existence of a deep volcano , inactive . An expeditionary force going in here could cut their jugular . But how could we reach it ? With our own tunnel borer . Kramer ? Uh-huh . He 's just about performed a miracle . I 'll show you . It 's not as sophisticated as their machines but it works . It works damned well . All right , let 's get comfortable . We have a lot of work to do before the morning . - Welcome to Hawaii . - How 's it going ? I just left the general staff meeting . Everything 's set . - And the backup troops ? - Standing by to follow our probe . Oh , I 'm sorry . This is Miss Yung from the University of Hawaii . - How do you do ? - Miss Yung is an expert potholer or spelunker , if you wish . She 's a top authority on volcanic passages . - Does she know what we 're up against ? - I 'm fully aware , commander . We 've got the borer unloaded . Where do you want it ? - Let 's get it down in the hole immediately . - Right . Kelly , bring her through . We continue north through here as far as it goes . How long will that take ? Another six hours , at least . Well , it ends here , all right . I read 325 degrees to intercept . I make it 330 . All right . Okay , let 's have the borer up here . - Ready ? - Yes , it 's all yours . Switch on . More power . Increase to phase five intensity . Cut the lasers ! We 're too close . Reverse about two feet and hold it . Switch on . Phase seven intensity . And watch your temperatures . We don 't wanna reach critical . Cut the lasers ! Watch it . Careful , that 's hot . Look what 's ahead . Fabulous . Mulberry , I think we 're close , very close . Split up the men . Check these passages . One of them should go where we wanna go . Right . Sergeant Mulberry , take Kennedy , scout the left . Bronsky , Hoffman , check straight ahead . Wilson , Williams , check the left . Sellack , come with me . - Cigarette ? - Thanks . How long have you been exploring caves ? Oh , about 11 years . I come from a family of potholers . My father believed in starting us young . - What do you do at the university ? - I 'm a geologist . We 're very glad that you could come along with us . Jon , what happens when we find their tunnel ? We destroy it . But how ? I 'll show you . Come with me . With this . It 's an atom bomb , 10 megatons . Assembled especially for the job . We 've found the passage . It 's a dead end but it should lead us right up against the Chinese tunnel . - All right , let 's get the borer in . - Right . Bring her through , Laski . Increase to phase seven . Petrified silica . Switch off . - Can 't we shift to another location ? - Where ? Besides , we 'd lose too much time . Okay , I 'll try again . Switch on . Increase to phase nine . Slowly . Phase 10 . - It burnt out . - Can 't we repair it ? Not a chance . Well , we 've finally got a lead on them . - Do you recall this medallion ? - Yeah . Well , it 's an ancient emblem of the Lu warlords . Going back as far as the Ming Dynasty . And there 's a direct descendant . - General Chan Lu . - Chan Lu ? - Well , wasn 't he purged ? - We thought so . But now we 've got reliable word that he broke away from the central government organized a private army and took over the plutonium plants he was supposed to be guarding . Well , how can he get away with that ? He has . He 's a very important man . A veteran of the Long March . Our guess is that he 's got a couple of bombs sitting under Peking right now . So nobody dares move against him ? Nobody , not even us . Come on , Wilson . What do you think this is , a poker game ? Put your backs into it . That rock 's almost as tough as the petrified stuff . - Jon , I 'm sorry about the borer . - Oh , relax , it wasn 't your fault . I 've been thinking , suppose we missed something back there . Such as ? A direct route to their tunnel . Yeah , but we checked the cavern thoroughly . We moved through awfully fast . Major , I 've been at this underground game for years . I 've got a feeling , a hunch , there is a way through . You 'll be digging here for days . All right , Arnold , it 's worth a try . We 'll get a scouting party . Just two . I wanna travel fast and light . I 'll come with you . Ryan . This could be it . Yeah , but can we find our way back ? Don 't worry , I 've kept track . It must be straight ahead . So , Dr. Kramer , you are finally awake . Welcome to our Sub-Pacific Headquarters . How did you know I was Dr. Kramer ? You have told us all about yourself . Indeed you have , doctor . And I sympathize with your frustrations . A man of your aptitude should have been acclaimed by his countrymen long ago . Tell me , doctor , have you ever considered changing sides ? It could be most advantageous to all concerned . Swimming the Yangtze does not agree with me . You do not understand . I owe nothing to Peking . Sorry . I still won 't help you . What a pity . Ah ! Ah ! Permit me to introduce Dr. Arnn . We have reason to think that our American friend struggles with shall we say , subconscious desires . Subconscious desires to join our forces . - But ... - His mind is not free . Exactly . Please look at me . I am your friend . Remember and think and remember . I am your friend . Red is green and green is red . The East sun rises and the West is dead . Red is green and green is red . The East sun rises and the West is dead . Red is green and green is red . The East sun rises and the West is dead . Red is green and green is red . The East sun rises and the West is dead . Red is green . Green is red . The East sun rises . The West is dead . - The men are tired . - Try working shorter shifts . - We 've done that . - Quiet . We found it . This narrow passage here . It starts to lead away but bends back right into their tunnel . How did we miss that ? The entrance , it 's hidden behind these tall rocks . You 're sure it goes through ? I saw their soldiers . This is it , Jon . Where 's Cannon ? Waiting to guide the way . Okay , let 's move out . Pack load the bomb . All right , let 's get going . On your feet , Bronsky . This way . - Over there . - Where 's Cannon and Ryan ? They said they 'd meet us here . - Well , fan out and search for them . - It 's too late , commander . Commander Shaw , a pleasure to have you with us . Please sit down . My colleague , Dr. Kengh Lee . You honor us , sir . Dr. Lee was almost a compatriot of yours . A graduate of your MIT . A most excellent school . What do you want , general ? I suppose I should chide you for the trouble that you have caused us but I must admit admiration for your courage and ingenuity . Coming from you I don 't appreciate the compliment . Of course not . I know how you feel . But the ignorant days of global hostilities are about to pass into history . Very soon now victor and vanquished will join hands to rebuild the devastations of war . What are you getting at ? Within 48 hours , your country will be a desolate wilderness . We fear that more than a hundred million will perish . The task of rebuilding will be enormous . That is why we ask your help . We need men like you . Leaders who can take command and guide your surviving countrymen into the paths of peaceful reconstruction . As your puppet , of course . Your people will need you desperately . You would be advised to think again . No . No , thanks . Dr. Arnn ? No , later . Take him away . But only 48 hours . That 's what the general said . What 's the matter , Arnold ? - It 's my fault . All my fault . - Oh , what are you talking about ? When I searched the passage , I was captured . - I let them brainwash me and take control . - You led us into that ambush ? You don 't understand . I couldn 't help myself . - I couldn 't help ... - Why , you selfish ... Hey , hey , hey . Knock it off . It 's not gonna get us out of here . Sentry . Sentry . Quick , an accident . Have you got a bandage ? A bandage ? Thank you . Thank you . Jonathan . I can 't reach them . Well , let me try . Lift him up . Got them . Somebody 's coming . Come on . How could you permit such a thing to happen ? I did not imagine they could be so resourceful . May the gods destroy me for my blunders . A most desirable end , no doubt . But not likely to retrieve the prisoners . We must pull back another battalion . Organize all available men . Scour every foot of tunnel . Search each cul-De-sac and cavern . Yes , general . You surprise me . I thought that your total wrath would have descended upon that fool . What would that accomplish ? Chai is a good officer . Yes ? Good , how soon ? The bomb train is on the way . We 're boxed in . Look . Come . Up . Give me your hand . - There 's no time . - Well , quick . So long , Jon . Arnold . Fire . You , up there . Right . Continue the search . - What 's all the shooting about ? - Americans , they 've escaped . - How many ? - Three . I 'll keep an eye out . They are dangerous . You must wait until we clear the tunnel . Impossible . - I insist . - My train has priority . You wait here , that 's an order . Where 's the general ? I 'll get clearance from him . Very well . Come with me . Get up . Come on . Get up . The uniforms . What is the trouble ? Let 's go . Priority orders from General Chan . Get that out of our way immediately . Keep to the right . It should lead us back to the cavern . Attention , all drivers . Attention , all drivers . Prepare to move out . Prepare to move out . I regret this senseless delay . We shall arrange for you to continue without further interference from idiots . Do you want me to follow ? - No , you will not be needed . - No , general , no ! - No . No . - Drive on . Head to the passage . My convoy . Head them off . After them . We 'll never make it . It 's the end of the line . We must get help . And leave these to Chan Lu ? No .

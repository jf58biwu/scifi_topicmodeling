( # The Beatles : " All You Need Is Love " ) # Love , love , love # Love , love , love # Love , love , love # There ´ s nothing you can do that can ´ t be done # Nothing you can sing that can ´ t be sung # Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game # It ´ s easy # All you need is love Welcome ! ( Polite applause ) ( Applause grows louder ) This session is called in a matter of democratic crisis . And we are here gathered to resolve the question of revolt . We desire that these proceedings be conducted in a civilised manner . But humanity is not humanised without force . Errant children must sometimes be brought to book with a smack on their backsides . We draw your attention to the regrettable bullet . The community is at stake , and we have the means to protect it . The Assembly is now in security . Number Six is presented to you . He survived the ultimate test . Indeed . Then he must no longer be referred to as " Number Six " . He has gloriously vindicated the right of the individual to be individual . And this assembly rises to you ... sir . Sir , we crave your indulgence . The transfer of power requires some tedious ceremony . Perhaps you would observe the preliminaries from the chair of honour . ( Fanfare ) Sir , we thank you , and promise to be as brief as possible . ( Bleeping ) Resuscitate ! A revolution ! Get him out ! Key ! ( Bleeping ) ( High-pitched bleeping ) Revolt can take many forms . And here we have three specific instances . Number 48 . Thanks for the trip , Dad . Be grateful for the opportunity of pleading your case . Baby , what a crazy scene ! # Collarbone ´ s connected to the neckbone # And the neckbone ´ s connected to the headbone ... # Number 48 ! # Dem bones , dem bones gonna walk around ... # Number 48 ! # Dem bones , dem bones , dem dry bones # Dem bones , dem bones , dem ... # Number 48 ! ( Bleeping ) Order ! Order ! Release him ! Release him ! ( Stops singing ) Youth , with its enthusiasms , which rebels against accepted norm because it must - and we sympathise . It may wear flowers in its hair , bells on its toes . But , when the common good is threatened , when the function of society is endangered , such revolts must cease . They are non-productive ... and must be abolished ! Number 48 . # Hear # The word # Of the Lord ... # The hipbone is connected to the backbone ! # And the backbone ´ s connected to the headbone ... # ( Angry shouting ) ( Continues singing ) Young man ! Give it to me again . - Don ´ t knock yourself out . - Give me the rest . Young ... man . I ´ m bone all over . Thank you for your intervention , but we fear that such familiarity is not appropriate . We must maintain the status quo . Now , Number ... ( Bleeping ) Yes , of course . Naturally . Very well . To your places ! Sir , temporarily , we may use the new form of address , to bring these proceedings to a conclusion . Those in favour ? ( Applause ) Carried ! We are obliged ... sir . Don ´ t mention it , Dad . Young ... man . - You got the message ? - Just . You ´ ve never been with us . I ´ m gone . But you were here . - Got the word ? - Yes . Got the sign ? The light ? The message ? Then you went and gone . Give it to me , baby ! - Give all you want . - That ´ s it ! - And take . - That ´ s it ! - Take ! Take ! - Take ! Take ! ( All ) Take ! Take ! Take ! Take ! Now you ´ re high ! I ´ m low . Give it to me , baby ! Confess ! Oh , Dad , I ´ m your baby , Dad . - Confess ! - My bones is yours , Dad . They came from you , my daddy . Confess ! Now you ´ re hep ! Hip , Dad , hip . - Confess ! - And a hipbone . And a thighbone . Shinbone , kneebone , backbone , all yours , Dad . - Confess ! - Kneebone ! ( Record ) # Ezekiel cracked dem dry bones , Ezekiel cracked dem dry bones # Ezekiel cracked dem dry bones , Now hear the word of the Lord # Ezekiel connected dem dry bones , Ezekiel connected dem dry bones # Ezekiel connected dem dry bones , Now hear the word of the Lord # Well , your toebone connected to your footbone # Your footbone connected to your heelbone # Your heelbone connected to your anklebone # Your anklebone connected to your legbone # Your legbone connected to your kneebone # Your kneebone connected to your thighbone # Your thighbone connected to your hipbone # Your hipbone connected to your backbone # Your backbone connected to your shoulderbone # Your shoulderbone connected to your neckbone # Your neckbone connected to your headbone ... # Hip ! Hip ! Hip ! HOORAY ! And hear the word of the Lord ! Guilty ! Read the charge ! The prisoner is charged with the most serious breach of social etiquette . Total defiance of the elementary laws which sustain our community . Questioning the decisions of those we voted to govern us . Unhealthy aspects of speech and dress not in accordance with general practice . The refusal to observe , wear or respond to his number . - Sir , you approve the proceedings ? - I ... note them . Sir , you have no comment at this stage ? Not at this stage . The accused will be held in the place of sentence until after your inauguration . Remove him ! # Hear the word of the Lord # Dem bones , dem bones , dem dry bones # ( Singing fades ) ( Judge ) Most regrettable . My apologies , sir . Don ´ t mention it . Our next revolutionary is a different kettle of fish altogether . Next ! ( Bleeping ) ( Raucous laughter ) ( General laughter ) ( Laughter stops instantly ) I feel a new man ! My dear chap ! How have you been keeping ? Throne at last . I knew it . It had to be . And you , my little friend . Ever faithful . Come on . Come on ! Come on ! New allegiances . Such is the price of fame . And failure . Dear me ! How sad ! My lords , ladies and gentlemen ! A most extraordinary thing happened to me on my way here . ( Enthusiastic applause ) ( Stops instantly ) It has been my lot in the past to wield a considerable power . I have had the ear of statesmen , kings and princes . Governments have been swayed , revolutions nipped in the bud at a word from me in the right place and at a propitious time . Not surprising that this community should find a use for me . Not an accident that I should be abducted and wake up here . What is deplorable is that I resisted for so short a time . A fine tribute to your methods . I thank you for placing me in a position of power second only to one . This authority gave me the right to make decisions . My last decision concerned this gentleman . It could be resolved only in the death of one of us . He emerged victorious . I , apparently ... ( Recording of Six ) ´ Die ! Die ! ´ .. died . ´ Die ! Die ! ´ Hush it up ! ( Heartbeat ) ´ Die ! ´ Was it the drink ? You couldn ´ t let me rest in peace . How was it done ? There have to be security secrets from our late Number Two . - ( Number Six ) Did you meet him ? - What ´ s that ? - Did you ever meet Number One ? - Face to face ? - Yes . - MEET HIM ? ! Meet him ! ( Bleeping ) Shall I ... give him a stare ? You transgress ! I shall give him a stare . Look me in the eye . Whoever you are . Whatever you are . ( Judge ) You ´ ll die ! Again ? Then I ´ ll die with my own mind . You ´ ll hypnotise me no longer ! ( Distressed bleeping ) ( Bleeping peters out ) - Sir ? - Hold him . In the place of sentence ? Until my inauguration . Secure him ! Be seeing you . We have Just witnessed two forms of revolt . The first , uncoordinated youth rebelling against nothing it can define . The second , a successful , secure member of the establishment turning upon and biting the hand that feeds him . These attitudes are dangerous , they contribute nothing to our culture and are to be stamped out . ( Bleeping ) At the other end of the scale , we are honoured to have with us a revolutionary of different calibre . He has revolted , resisted , fought , held fast , maintained , destroyed resistance , overcome coercion . The right to be person , someone or individual . We applaud his private war , and concede that , despite materialistic efforts , he has survived intact and secure . All that remains is ... recognition of a man . A man of ... steel . A man magnificently equipped to lead us . That is ... lead us ... or go . In this connection , we have a prize . Your home is being made ready . Above and beyond this , we have the means for you to desert us and go anywhere . Key to your house . Traveller ´ s cheques - a million . Passport . Valid for anywhere . And petty cash . You are free to go . - Free to go ? - Anywhere . - Why ? - You are an example to us . - Why ? - You have shown us our mistakes . Why ? You are pure . You know the way . Show us . Why ? Your revolt is good and honest . You are the only individual . We need you . - I see . - You do . You see all . - I ´ m an individual ? . - You are on your own . I fail to see . All about you is ... yours . We concede . We offer . We ... plead for you to lead us . Or go ? Go , if you wish . I don ´ t know . Take the stand . Address us . Should I ? You must . You are the greatest . Make a statement . A true statement which could only be yours , but for us . Remember us . Don ´ t forget us . Keep us in mind . Sir ... we are all yours . ( Instant silence ) ( Drowned out by crowd ) ( Drowned out again ) ( Speech inaudible ) ( Chanting ) Aye ! Aye ! Aye ! ( Inaudible ) ( Chant continues ) Aye ! Aye ! Aye ! ( All ) Hip , hip , hooray ! Sir , on behalf of us all , we thank you . And now I take it that you are prepared to meet ... Number One . Follow me , if you would be so kind . Sir . ( Fanfare ) ( Raucous laughter ) # And hear that word of the Lord # ´ I will not be pushed , filed , stamped , indexed , ´ briefed , debriefed or numbered . ´ I will not be pushed , filed , stamped , indexed , ´ briefed , debriefed or numbered . ´ My life is my own . ´ ´ I ! I ! I ! I ! I ! I ! I ! ´ ( Demonic cackling ) ( Singing and laughter become audible ) ( Organ music ) Contact . Control ! Confirm contact priority . Contact priority ! Contact control ! Contact control ! Emergency ! Contact ! Contact control ! Emergency ! ( Fanfare ) All personnel , take cover ! ( Silence ) ( Judge ) Evacuate ! Evacuate ! Evacuate ! Evacuate ! ( # The Beatles : " All You Need Is Love " ) # All you need is love # All you need is love # All you need is love , love # Love is all you need # ´ Evacuate ! Evacuate ! ´ ( Alarm ) ( Siren )

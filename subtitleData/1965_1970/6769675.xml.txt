 Sorry we had to get you up at this hour , Mr. Grant . I thought I was on vacation . What 's it all about ? I can 't tell you that . - Where are we going ? - I can 't tell you that either . You 're to stay inside , Mr. Grant , and wait . Your ID card , please . Thank you . - Hello , Grant . - General Carter ! Good to see you again . - The Pentagon , wasn 't it , General ? - That 's right . Only you weren 't in that uniform . Come on . Benes ! What the devil happened ? The other side got to him . - How bad off is he ? - Brain injury . He 's in a coma . Before or after what he wanted to tell you ? Before he could breathe a word . He 's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we 're after . That 's why we have to operate . And why we need you . Me ? I can 't even put a Band-Aid on my finger . Here 's the surgeon . Duval . Dr. Peter Duval . Top brain man in the country . Ever hear of him ? - Sorry , I 'm rusty on surgeons . Who 's the girl ? - Cora Peterson , his technical assistant . - You 'll be joining Duval and the others . - What can I do ? Except maybe pass out . Mike ? Yes , Alan . Meet Grant . This is Dr. Michaels , chief of the medical section . - Glad to have you with us , Mr. Grant . - I wish I knew why . Tell him where he fits in , will you ? I 've got a few things to check out . We need you for security purposes , Mr. Grant . - At an operation ? - They know they failed to kill Benes . Security thinks they 'll try again , first chance they get . We 're afraid of sabotage . Surgical assassination . Surgical assassination ? - That means you suspect ... - Duval . That 's right . Well , I don 't agree . Just because he 's often difficult . - Difficult ? He 's impossible . - That 's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty . Why take the chance ? There must be other doctors . Duval 's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country , and there 's no time . Besides , he 's right here at hand . I wouldn 't know if he 's trying to save him or kill him . I 'll be standing by . I would know . No matter what happens , you 're to take orders only from Dr. Michaels . - Understand ? - Right , sir . Come on along . They 'll be operating shortly . See you later , Mike . His technician okay ? In addition to the looks department ? No question of her loyalty . - I 'll take that , Corporal . - Yes , sir . I don 't mean to be inquisitive , but this CMDF . For all I know , it could stand for the ... Consolidated Mobilization of ... Delinquent Females . Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces . Say that again ? We can reduce anything down to any size we want . People , ships , tanks , planes . General , I 've heard some wild ones , but this takes it . We can shrink an army with all its equipment . Put it in a bottle cap . That 's why we call it Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces . If the other side of it gets a hold of a thing like that ! They have . But we both have the same problem ... Lack of control . They can only miniaturize things for exactly 60 minutes . After that everything starts growing back to its original size . - I assume Benes knows how to control it . - That 's right . He wanted us to have the secret , not them . - That 's why they tried to kill him . - They 'll probably try again . No wonder you want me to stand by during the operation . And take a little trip with him . Trip ? Where to ? Well , the only way we can reach that clot is from inside the brain . So , we 've decided to put a surgical team and crew into a submarine , reduce it way down in size , and inject it into an artery . - You mean I 'm going along ? - As part of the crew , yes . Wait a minute . They can 't shrink me . - Our miniaturizing can shrink anything . - But I don 't want to be miniaturized ! - It 's just for an hour . - Not even for a minute ! General Carter , sir , I really think you should reconsider your choice . I just don 't think I 'm the right kind of man for this kind of job . Grant , you 're going to a briefing . Miss Peterson volunteered to come along . So did every male technician in this unit . A woman has no place on a mission of this kind . I insist on taking my technician . You 'll take along who I assign . Don 't tell me who I 'm going to work with , not on this operation or any other . I 'll do what I think is best without interference from anyone ! Dr. Duval has relied on Miss Peterson for years . And since she wants to come along , I think it 's for the best , Dr. Reid . Well , I disagree with you . Since you 're in charge , go ahead and do as you please . But I want it all on record as being against it . Grant , Colonel Reid , operational commander . - How are you ? - You 've met our medical chief . - Dr. Duval , head surgeon . - I 've heard of you , Doctor . Miss Peterson , his technical assistant . - And this is Captain Bill Owens , - How are you , Miss Peterson ? designer of an experimental submarine for the Navy 's research and development program . - Out of your element , aren 't you , Captain ? - Sort of . - That makes two of us . - Grant is uniquely suited to this mission . He 's a communications expert and he was a frogman during the war . Besides that , he brought Benes into this country . And the fewer people who know about that , the better . In any rate , you 'll find Grant invaluable should anything go wrong once you 're underway . Okay , Don . Here 's the overall target area . Doctor ? Benes 's brain . As near as we can map it stereotaxically . The clot is right here . It 's impossible to get at without damage to the intervening tissue , which would prove fatal to Benes . The only way to reach it is via the arterial system . Phase one calls for miniaturizing a submarine , with crew and surgical team , and injecting it into the carotid artery . How small will it be ? About the size of a microbe . We 're putting Benes in deep hypothermia . What ? That 's freezing him as low as is compatible with human life . It 'll slow down his heartbeat , circulation and all other physical processes . Well , even so , Colonel , because of our size ... Well , I mean , the lack of it , we 'll still be cruising pretty fast . We 'll be smashed to bits if there 's any turbulence . The only danger of turbulence is in the heart . And we 're not going through it . Once in the carotid artery , we remain within the arterial system until we reach the point of the damage , where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam . Thank you . After the operation , we return by way of the venous system until we reach the base of the neck , where we 'll be removed . Right here . With a hypodermic . How will you know where the sub is at any aprticular moment ? Dr. Michaels is a circulatory specialist and will act as your navigator . He 'll know just where you are and you can communicate directly with us by wireless . Besides that , the sub is nuclear powered . And we 'll be tracking it , just as we would any radioactive tracer . There 'll be a team of surgeons standing by . They 'll be prepared to remove you immediately should anything happen . In any event , you must be out within 60 minutes . After that , you 're in danger of attack . Attack ? Who ? Or should I say what from ? Benes 's natural defenses . Oh , white corpuscles , antibodies . You see , once you begin to grow , you become a menace to the body and you 'll trigger them off . And there may be other unknown factors . We can 't be certain of anything . Any further questions ? Anybody ? - Just one , General . - Yes , what 's that ? Where do I get a cab back to town ? Dr. Michaels , I think you 'd better proceed to the sterilization section . Yes , sir . Will you follow me ? How much can a man give to his country ? Your attention , please . Make the final preparations . Heart . How 's it look , Henry ? Holding steady . 32 per minute . Respiration . Jack , what 's the report ? Respiration is down to six a minute . I wouldn 't take him down any further . Hypothermia . Any problems , Dr. Sawyer ? No , sir . We 're holding him at 28 degrees Centigrade . - How do we stand ? - Medical 's ready . Colonel , they 're now entering the sterilization corridor , sir . Please board and check all your equipment immediately . Here 's the particle , sir . - Everything aboard ? - All squared away , sir . Dr. Michaels ? - Yes ? - Here 's your chart table right here . These are all the maps and charts in sequence from left to right . - And here 's your checklist . - All right . Dr. Duval and I will just check the charts . Fine . Mr. Grant ? - This is your wireless station right here . - Oh , good . - Ocular motor nerve . - I see . Brain . No . - Need any help , skipper ? - Oh , yeah . We 'll save some time , Mr. Grant . Open this thing for me , would you ? - Okay . - Set it down there . - Where ? On the deck here ? - Yeah , right there . - That 's radioactive material ! - It 's atomic fuel . - Is it all right to open it ? - Oh , it 's perfectly safe . There 's a microscopic radioactive particle inside . Nothing big enough to be seen with the naked eye . - Is that it ? - Yeah , that 's it . If it 's no military secret , how ca a sub run on a microscopic particle ? Well , they can 't reduce nuclear fuel . But once the reactor 's been miniaturized along with the submarine , a microscopic particle should put out enough energy to activate it . That 's cutting it mighty close for a perfect fit . Well , it should work , theoretically . If it doesn 't , the whole mission 's off . You see , this craft is nuclear powered . All except for your wireless . All in all , quite a canoe . Designed for piscatorial research . Spawning habits of deep-sea fish . That reminds me , I 'd better spawn a radio message . Test message from the Proteus , sir . " Miss Peterson has smiled . " - Well , that 's an auspicious sign . - Confirm receiving . - Captain ? - Mmm ? How will you be able to follow my charts from up there ? Well , there 's no power on right now , but once there is ... May I have this chart , please ? ... you just place the chart right here , and it will come through on that repeater . - Repeater ? - Yeah , the devi ... Come on , I 'll show you . - There , that 's it . - Oh , yes . It all seems quite simple to operate . Actually , it is , although the controls are highly sophisticated . Look here . There 's a button and a switch for everything . Bet you 're pretty handy around the house . Can you cook ? We 're pushing oxygen today . I 'll have some laughing gas , ma 'am . You sound as if you 're not looking forward to it . It 's not exactly a pleasure cruise , you know . I think it 's very exciting . We 're going to see things no one has ever seen before . Not just something under a microscope . - Think about it . - That 's the trouble , I am . - Being shrunk ! - You may learn to like it . Excuse me . For a nice young lady , you play with the damnedest toys , Miss Peterson . That 'll teach you where to keep your hand . Now I know . That could be quite a lethal weapon . It could kill , not cure . Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval . The beam from this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter . I understand you 've been Dr. Duval 's assistant for quite some time . He must have snatched you out of a cradle ! I 've been with him since I got out of school . He brought me into the CMDF over five years ago . - That 's a long time with one man . - Not working with someone like Dr. Duval . He 's ... Well ... - Prepare for miniaturization . - Positions , please . - I still have something to check . - Right . Mr. Grant ? There are two seats under the chart table . Would you pull them out , please ? Secure your safety belts . Miss Peterson , this is your chair right here . - Here , Doctor , let me help you . - No , no , no , it 's all right . I can manage . - Doctor ? - Yes , Cora . I ... I wanted to say that ... What is it ? Is anything wrong ? No , nothing . I just wanted to say ... thank you for taking me along . Thank you for volunteering . Right , Mr. Grant . You can tell them the Proteus is ready . - The Proteus ? What 's that ? - It 's the name of this vessel . Sounds better than calling it the U-91035 . Proteus reports all secured , sir . - Miniaturizer . - Miniaturizer . - All stations , stand by . - All stations , stand by . All medical posts , stand by . Check scanner . Computer 9-5 . Checks out on radar . Instruct computer for a plus 6-0-9 . - Phase one . - Phase one . - Colonel ? - Okay to proceed . - Phase two . - Phase two . - Elevate zero module . - Elevate zero module . - Lower zero module . - Lower zero module . Halt and transfer . HDR in order . - Elevate zero module . - Elevate zero module . We 'll have to submerge manually . Mr. Grant , open induction valves one and two . - Where are they ? - Oh , there 's one port and one starboard . On the bulkhead right behind you . - I 'll get the other . - Fine . - You ready ? - Yeah . - Induction valve open . - Check . - Valve open . - Check . Close valves . - Valve closed . - Valve closed . Right . That 's all for the present . - I can 't breathe . - Dr. Michaels . - I can 't breathe . - Dr. Michaels ! I 've got to get out . It 's too late for that . Now , we must go on . I 'm sorry . I 've got claustrophobia . I was ... I was buried alive in an air raid in England . Two days . I thought I 'd got over it . Please forgive me . I 'll really be all right now . Come on . You 'll feel better once we 're underway . Thank you . Lock and hold . - Okay , Colonel . - Okay . - Phase three . - Phase three . All stations , 60 and counting . - Inform Proteus they are at full reduction . - Yes , sir . - At full reduction . - Right . - That air feels good . - Yes . - Are you all right ? - Yes , I 'm okay . Mr. Grant , tell them the Proteus is on power . - Proteus on power , sir . - Okay , Don , it 's all yours . - Phase four . - Phase four . - Elevate zero module . - Elevate zero module . Check thermal blanket . Tracking . Contact Proteus . - Stand by for injection . - Right . Inject . Tracking post . The medieval philosophers were right . Man is the center of the universe . We stand in the middle of infinity , between outer and inner space . And there 's no limit to either . I never imagined it could be anything like this . I always thought it was nothing but red . Only to the naked eye . Those corpuscles carrying oxygen give the stream its color . The rest of the plasma 's very much like sea water . - An ocean of life . - End to end , 100,000 miles long . - Dr. Duval ? - Hmm ? What could those be ? That looks like the molecular structure of proteins . I don 't agree . - I think we should stop and investigate . - No , I 'm afraid we haven 't time . Captain , keep your present heading until we 're in the clear . Arterial wall to the left . - What 's our speed ? - 15 knots . You should reach the main branching artery in two minutes . Keep the wall at its present distance when you turn . That should bring you safely into the middle of the branch . Right . Captain , correct your course and speed ! She won 't respond . We 're in some sort of current . - But that isn 't possible . - Not in a sealed vessel like an artery . There must be something wrong with your controls . No , it 's a current . It 's too strong . I can 't seem to break out of it . Whirlpool ! Strap yourselves in ! Anyone hurt ? Cora ? I 'm all right . Thank you , Doctor . Where are we ? The corpuscles are blue . Captain , what 's your compass heading ? Proteus off course . They 've ... crossed over into the jugular vein ! That can 't be . There 's no direct connection between the two . Well , normally not . Unless there 's an arteriovenous fistula . A what ? It 's a forced joining of a vein and an artery . It must have happened when Benes was hurt . Yes , a fistula too small to show up in the tests . - But big enough for us . - Captain , can you head back into the artery ? No , we can 't fight that current . It 's physically impossible . Well , try not to drift down any further . I 'll do what I can . If we can go back , is there an alternate route ? Well , we can go forward on this course , but ... that means going directly through the heart . No , no , we can 't do that either , remember ? We decided in the briefing . This craft could never stand the turbulence . Yes , it would be a hundred times worse than the whirlpool . That 's just dandy ! We can 't go forward and we can 't go back . There 's only one thing we can do . Call off the mission . Well , we 've no choice . We 've got to take them out . No . We 've still got 51 minutes . Leave ' em in . But it 's hopeless . They can 't go back and they can 't go on . I tell you there 's nothing else we can do but remove them . Not until the very last second . We gotta think of something . Something to save the situation . Proteus reports trapped in venous system . Requests removal , sir . Well , there it is . What do I tell them , General ? Doctor ... Without killing him , how long could we stop his heart ? - Well , the less time the better . - I know , I know , but what 's the maximum ? Well , in his comatose state and everything slowed down , no more than 60 seconds . At top speed , adjusting distance for degree of miniaturization ... the sub should get through the heart in exactly 57 seconds . That gives us only three seconds to revive him . What are the problems involved in stopping the heart ? Nothing compared with starting it up again . We 're wasting time , Colonel . Let 's get on with it . Message to Proteus . - Cardiac red alert . - Maintaining maximum speed , the sub should get through the heart in 57 seconds . This will allow us three seconds to spare , in which to revive him . In order to minimize the turbulence , we will have to arrest the heart . Prepare for cardiac shock . Remove the radar . The Proteus will proceed to the entrance of the right atrium , at which point the heart will be stopped , by electric shock . 57 seconds . And if it should take longer for us to get through ? We can 't take a second more . Captain , head in the direction of the flow and then drift with it . Well , that looks pretty complicated . But I shall be able to guide you once we 're inside . Okay . Ready for cardiac shock . Cardioscope . Tracking . Listen ... The heart . - Yes . It 's slowed down a great deal . - Sounds like heavy artillery . It lays down quite a barrage . Over 40 million beats in a year . And every beat separates a man from eternity . - Stand by . - Stand by . They 're about to stop the heart ! Full power when we enter the valve ! Hit it ! 24 seconds left . Including three to revive him . 19 seconds , Doctor . The semilunar valve should be on our left any second now . Stand by to revive . - There it is ! - Bear to your left ! - Can you see it , Captain ? - Yes . I see it now . Brace yourselves . There should be a tremendous surge when the heart starts up again . If it does . 8 seconds left . Now ! They 're in the pulmonary artery . Well , they 'll make up some time once they get through that and reach the pleural cavity . Respiration post . - What 's his rate , Jack ? - Back to 6 per minute . Damn it ! I just had them cleaned . They all lead to the same place ... The lungs . Dr. Michaels , the channel is getting awfully narrow . Yes , we 're entering a capillary . Try to stay in the middle . The wall 's transparent . It 's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick . And porous . Doctor , just think of it . We 're the first ones to actually see it happen . The living process . Mind letting me in on what 's going on out there ? Oh , it 's just a simple exchange , Mr. Grant . Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide in return for oxygen coming through on the other side . - Don 't tell me they 're refueling ! - Oxygenation . We 've known that it exists even though we never saw it . Like the structure of the atom . But to actually see one of the miracles of the universe , the engineering of the cycle of a breath . Well , I wouldn 't call it a miracle . Just an interchange of gases . The end product of 500 million years of evolution . You can 't believe all that is accidental ? That there isn 't a creative intelligence at work ? Well , the creative intelligence ... - Mr. Grant ... - What is it , skipper ? I 'm losing pressure in the flotation tanks . Would you check the manual control panel ? It 's aft on the starboard side . All right . The left tank 's losing pressure . There must be a short in the electrical valve circuit system . Yeah . That takes care of the valves . I suppose it happened , because of that electric shock . - Is there any damage ? - Not to the valve . But we 've lost so much air , we can 't make it the rest of the way . What do you propose to do , Captain ? There 's nothing we can do . We can 't continue without full tanks . - Any reserve air ? - Enough to breathe , but that 's all . Excuse me . Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber , one of the countless alveoli of the lung , and we can 't get enough air to fill a microscopic tank ! Maybe we can . - Skipper , is there a snorkel on this sub ? - Yes , there is . Could I run a tube through that wall without harming Benes ? At our present size , I should think so , certainly . If those corpuscles can take on air , there 's no reason why we can 't . All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talking about , and when Benes inhales , there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank . How 's that sound to you , skipper ? Well , it 's a dangerous procedure . If I miss the timing , we could explode the air tanks , but ... I 'm willing to try it . I think we should . Yes , of course . We must try it . One more thing . It 'll be safer , if everybody leaves the sub but me . I 'll get the equipment . Cora ? Looks like you didn 't fasten it down too well . - But I did ! I 'm positive ! - Then how come it worked loose ? I 've no idea . How badly is it damaged ? I don 't know , Doctor . We 'll have to test it . That 'll have to wait until after we 're refueled . I can 't imagine how it possibly could have happened . I distinctly remember fastening it down . Must 've been jarred loose during the whirlpool . Better get these on as quickly as possible . They 've stopped on the outer limits of the left lung . Another delay , with only 42 minutes left . It 'll be close , but there 's still a margin of safety . Let 's find out what the devil 's holding them up . Contact the Proteus . Must be some kind of mechanical difficulty . - I thought I told you to cut down on the sugar . - Uh ? Oh , I can 't help it . I 'm just weak , I guess . - Shouldn 't you answer that ? - Not now . We need air , not greetings . Come on , Doctor . Come on . Now remember , be sure to secure the bottom hatch once you 're outside . Right . It 's full of rocks . Those are impurities embedded in the lung . Carbon from smoke and specks of dust . Well , we 'd better get on with it . Careful ! There 's a tremendous air pressure in there in relation to our size . I 'll try to hold her from the other side of the wall . Maybe that will do it . - Tie my safety line to the sub . - Here . Let me have it . All right , now . Push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside . Wait for the lull between the time he inhales and exhales . Now ! Full . He 's gone ! What can we do ? " Delay caused by stop to refuel air . " " Proceeding through pleural cavity . " Refuel air ? Why not ? They had a choice of over a billion alveoli . And a broken trigger wire . A smashed transistor . No way to fire the lamp . Well , that 's the end of the laser . - You must carry spare parts . - Nothing that 's built into the chassis . - If it only hadn 't come loose ! - That 's beside the point now . Isn 't there another surgical procedure you could try ? No . No , there 's no other way . I really don 't see the sense in going on with this . - But we must ! - With no laser ? If you had a transistor about this size and power output and a thin enough wire , could you piece it together ? Yes , but it requires absolute precision . A surgeon might . Yes . Yes , I could do it . Well , if I had the parts ! I 've got a source . All we have to do is tap it . Grant , just a minute . You 're surely not going to dismantle the wireless ! It 's just one transistor and a circuit wire , that 's all it takes . That 'll knock out our communications . We 'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside . They 'd still be able to track us by radar , because of the radioactive fuel . What 's it to be ? The wireless or Benes ' life ? Send a message to the control tower . Message from the Proteus , sir . " Cannibalising wireless to repair laser . " - They 're what ? ! - " This is our last message . " Incommunicado ! Now they 're really on their own . We can track ' em , but that 's all we can do . Something told me I got into the wrong end of this business . Inner space ... The transistor will do , but the wire is much too thick . - There 's nothing closer . - Let me see . I might be able to scrape it thin enough . Cora , would you bring me a number 11 scalpel , please ? Yes , Doctor . Looks like the sea at dawn . We 're safe as long as it remains that color . We 're in the pleural sac . It keeps the lungs from rubbing against the wall of the chest , up there . When those membranes become inflamed , we end up with pleurisy and a racking cough . Cough ? If he can kick up a storm by just breathing ! His pleura 's in fine condition . Should be plain sailing from here on . Let 's hope so . So far , someone 's tried to sabotage this mission twice . Sabotage ? I don 't quite understand . I saw the laser just before we started . It was fastened down securely . You don 't suppose what happened was an accident ? Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub . - Surely you don 't seriously suspect Duval . - That line was tampered with . I don 't know what to say . Well , I know he 's under a cloud , but ... There 's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession . We still never know what 's going on in anyone 's mind . I don 't believe it . Whatever happended , was an accident . - Two in a row ? - It 's possible . Look at those walls up ahead . We 're entering the lymphatic system . Those are nuclei of cells lining a duct . I always had an idea there was only one system , the circulatory . The lymphatic system drains off excess fluid from the tissues . Without it , we 'd all blow up like balloons . - Looks like quite a navigation problem . - Only until we get through the nodes . The lymphatic glands . - Keep your present compass heading . - Right . Skipper , we 're picking up seaweed , or whatever that is . Reticular fibers . We ought to be clear of them soon . Well , I hope so , Doctor . Because if that stuff clogs the vents , the engines will overheat . What 's causing all this ? - Looks like somebody declared war . - That 's exactly what it is . Antibodies destroying bacteria or any other foreign invader that threatens the system . Look , it 's taken on its exact shape ! - It 's like hand in glove . - Much closer . Like two atoms . We 'll never get there in time at this rate . Isn 't there another route so that we can bypass all this ? - No . - Yes ! - There 's no other suitable route . - Yes , there is . - We can transfer to the inner ear . - Yes ... And go by way of the endolymphatic duct . Why don 't we take it ? Because it 's infinitely more hazardous than the route we 're following now . You see , once in the ear , any noise at all in the operating theater would be disastrous . At our reduced size , any vibrations inside the ear would have a shattering effect . Well , they 're tracking us topside . Once they see where we 're going , I 'm sure they 'll take every precaution . All right . Let 's hope they realize the danger . Captain , I 'll give you a new heading . Proteus turning , in quadrant 7-3 . Finally . They 're heading for the inner ear . About time they realized they 'd never make it the other way . Your attention , please . Proteus is about to enter the inner ear . You are not to walk , talk , or make a sound of any kind . Absolute silence must be maintained until they are out of the danger area . - What 's wrong , skipper ? - Just what I was afraid would happen . That stuff that we passed through that looks like seaweed ? - Yes , reticular fibers . - Mmm . Well , it clogged the intake vents . We 're not getting any propulsion . - Well , there 's only one thing to do . - What ? I 'll see if maybe there 's some way I can clear those vents . How long do you think it 'll take ? Quite some time . Wouldn 't it be quicker if we all helped ? Yes , you 're quite right . We haven 't a minute to spare . - Would you ... help ? - Oh , yes . I 'll stay behind . I 'd better use the time to finish repairing the laser . Why don 't you start on the engines ? Report no movement of the Proteus since entering quadrant 7-4 at level D. 24 minutes left , maximum . This is just what we need , another delay . You 'll wind up a Hindu . They respect all forms of life , however small . Help ! Please , help ! There she is ! She 's damaging those fibers . Antibodies will attack any moment . Grant , the pressure . I ... - I can 't ... - Get back to the sub . I 'll get her out . Hurry ! - Where are they ? - They 're below the cells of Hensen . If the antibodies reach her , they 'll attack as if she were bacteria . Open it ! Open it before they get here ! I can 't till the hatch is flooded . They 're tightening ! Please ! I ... can 't ... breathe . I can 't ... They 've crystallized . It 's all right , Cora . It 's all right . They 're on their way again . 12 minutes left . What a time to run out of sugar ! Looks like quite a way to go . We should reach the base of the brain shortly . From there it 's not far to the site of the injury . But we 're running out of time . Where 's that light coming from ? It 's from the outside world . Filtering in through Benes ' eardrum . That puts us right here . Which means we can head for the subarachnoid cavity . The Proteus has passed the inner ear and is now in the channel leading to the brain . I thought I 'd die when the scissors dropped on the floor ! - It 's against my better judgment . - Better judgement ? To wait until the actual operation when it may be too late ? - I 've done all I could with the laser ! - All I 'm asking is ... I 'm only asking him that he test it beforehand . If it doesn 't work , it 's beyond my power to fix it . But if it does work , there 's no telling how long it 'll stand up . It 's a jury-rig at best and we 'll need every second of use we can get out of it . That 's why I don 't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests ! - Dr. Duval , I insist that you test the laser . - I 'll do nothing of the sort ! The operation is my responsibility . I won 't do it , and that 's final . All right . As usual , you want everything your own way . Only this time there 's more at stake . I know perfectly well what 's at stake , Dr. Michaels . Imagine ! They 're in the human mind ! " Yet all the suns that light the corridors of the universe " shine dim before the blazing of a single thought ... " " ... proclaiming an incandescent glory : The myriad mind of Man . " Quite poetic , gentlemen . Let me know when we pass the soul . The soul ? The finite mind cannot comprehend infinity and the soul , which comes from God , is infinite . Yes , but our time isn 't . - If my calculations are correct ... - Doctor , what 's that up ahead ? That 's it ! That 's the site of the injury , that dark spot . - We 'd better get prepared . - There just isn 't time . I don 't see how you could possibly operate and get out of here before the hour 's up . Captain , you 'd better head for the removal point . Removal point ? What are you talking about ? We 've only six minutes left . We 'll just barely make it . Hold it , skipper . - What happens if we overstay ? - Once time 's up , deminiaturization begins . Then , within a matter of seconds , the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the system . Then , white corpuscles will swarm to destroy it as they would any other invader . Skipper , how long will it take us to get from here to the removal point ? About two minutes . That still leaves me four minutes to operate . All you 'll succeed in doing is getting us trapped . I simply won 't hear of it . Captain , return immediately to the removal point . All right . Grant , what are you doing ? My power 's gone ! Dr. Duval , get the laser . Grant , I 'm in charge of this mission . You were instructed to take orders from me , not to give them . I 'm sorry , the situation has changed . Nothing 's changed , so far as my authority goes ! We 've got to get out of here now ! It 's sheer suicide for all of us . I 'm not gonna let him operate ! Dr. Michaels , you 're in no condition to make any decision . Duval , you 're not gonna go through with this . I absolutely forbid it . I won 't allow you or anyone else to leave this ship ! I 'm going to do all I can to save Benes . You fool ! Don 't you see what you 've done ? You 've given him a perfect opportunity to kill Benes . - I don 't believe that . - Why not ? Because of all his gibberish about God and the soul ? Camouflage , that 's all that is , to blind the gullible IQ and cover up his real identity . A fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes ! And now you 've made it possible . I 've come up against fanatics before and Duval just doesn 't fit the pattern . Skipper , I 'm going out there . Maybe I can be of some help . Remember , we need at least two minutes to get out . How does it look , Doctor ? If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels ... Doctor , we 've had it . If I can clear this central nerve , that may be enough . Captain , there seems to be something wrong with the escape hatch . - What do you mean ? - Fluid is seeping through . I think you 'd better have a look at it . Fluid ? There shouldn 't be any fluid ... Yes , you 'll see it underneath the door . That should do it . Look ! - It 's heading right for the nerve ! - I don 't understand . The laser . Let me have the laser ! Give me your widest beam . Full power ! The ship 's finished . We 'll have to get out on our own . Is there a quick way out ? - What about Dr. Michaels ? - White corpuscles ! We 've got to get them out . They 'll ingest the ship and everything in it . Stay here , both of you . Hold them off if you can . What happened ? Dr. Michaels went berserk . - Berserk , nothing ! - Grant , help ! Get me out ! Get this on , quick . If a window blows we 'll lose this airlock . Grant , help ! I 'm trapped ! Help me ! Grant , can 't get my ... Can 't get my hands out . Get me out of here . My hands are trapped . I can 't move ... my hands . I can 't move my ... hands . I can 't move my hands . Get me out ! Get me out of here ! Get me out ! Get me out ! Come on , it 's no use ! - That 's the end of the laser . - You said there was a quick way out . We could follow the optic nerve to the corner of the eye . Time 's up . We 'll have to take them out immediately . It means killing Benes . For all we know , they may have completed the operation . Damn it to hell ! Attention , please ! You will remove the Proteus immediately . Remove the radar . Prepare for trephination . Light impulses . On the way to the brain . We 're nearing the eye . Hold it , Doctor ! What is it ? That blip we 're picking up might only be a radioactive particle . The Proteus may already be destroyed . What are you getting at ? If I were in their place , and I 'm running out of time , I 'd abandon ship before I grew to dangerous size and use the extra few minutes to get out the quickest way possible . On my own . Along the optic nerve to the eye . Wait 30 seconds . Glass slide , quick ! Open that door , please !

 Is he conscious yet ? - No . Want to see him ? Will he live ? All I can say is that he survived the operation . You shouldn 't have bothered . I 'd have called for you . Is he dead ? No , but he 's still unconscious . It has been three days already ... I wonder if it 's worth the trouble to intervene . If he could be moved we could start the experiment now . We 'll think about it . Any dying person can be maintained like that . Who knows ? - We do . The experience would kill him . We need a healthy man . There he is . Will you talk to him now ? I 'd rather wait . Has he seen anyone ? - He doesn 't want to see anyone . Why don 't you want to do the experiment with one of your men ? You do have volunteers , didn 't you ? - Many , but they weren 't suitable . But why him ? He has nothing to lose . That 's what we 're looking for . Why not pick a convict ? Offer him a pardon . That is not an option . Does he have any chance of returning ? It 's impossible to predict . This is the first time it 's being done with a man . I 'd like to meet him . I 'll call him for you . Wait a minute . You left your things back in your room . Thanks . I won 't need them . Claude Ridder ? Yes , that 's me . Do you have a moment , or rather , a day ? No , we 're not the police . I 'm from Crespel Research Centre . Crespel ? Never heard of it . Nobody has . If you have no other plans for today , I 'd like to take you there . Is it far ? Some 50 km . We have a car . How 's the weather ? Sunny . Then why not . - The taxi . - I 'll take care of it . Want to go by your house ? - No thanks . Am I the man you want ? Without a doubt . This isn 't a kidnapping . It wouldn 't go well for you . I have no family . What 's Crespel like ? It 's a place that doesn 't exist yet . Is it pretty ? Not particularly . Are you tired ? I 've been asked the same thing every hour for three weeks . Have you recovered well ? Why so much interest in me ? Can you smoke ? Yes , I 'm better now . Apart from cancer , I have nothing to worry about . Glad you were saved ? I 'm not sure I was saved . We 're nearly there . You don 't seem too worried . - It 's all the same to me . What else would you like to happen to me ? What if it 's something extraordinary ? Really , as in fairy tales ? You were right . It isn 't very pretty . But not without interest . This is Crespel ? - Yes , here . I thought it was a town . There is one 5 km away , but it 's not Crespel . The boss will see you straight away . Surprised ? Frankly , yes . The Centre has existed for 15 years . Around here it 's assumed we study agriculture . But the subject of agriculture is unknown to us . Our object of study is time . Have you figured it out ? - Partially . Where do I come in ? I have a question for you , Mr. Ridder , if you 'd like to answer it . All right . I suppose you had a reason to have attempted suicide ... Yes ... Have you changed your mind ? It may be necessary to ask this question again . - Who for ? - For you . No , it hasn 't changed . You 'd do it again ? I am the perfect guinea pig , right ? A volunteer who does not cling to life ? If I accept , what chance do I have of surviving ? 100 % if you were a mouse . Let me show you something . The passage of time , no doubt . I need to think about it . I found interesting your idea of a municipal agency to distribute time around the city as it sees fit . It wouldn 't work . - Time would break down . I always thought we should have a team of novelists ... paid to put their wild ideas on paper . In this jar is mouse A ; in the other , mouse B. Look at them . Do you see any difference ? I don 't know . Is one a female and the other male ? No , both are males . But mouse B is a pioneer . A has never left his jar . B travelled in time and went back to live for one minute in his past . A hero . When did this happen ? Yesterday . With no ill effects . How do you be sure that he travelled in time ? That 's the problem . We 're confident it happened , but he can 't tell us . The technicians thought of everything . They should have taught him to speak before doing the experiment . You 'll go back exactly one year into your past . And the experience won 't last any more than one minute . What if it kills me ? With the treatment we 've devised , that won 't happen . Where were you this time last year ? On holiday . I had 3 months off last year . I was in France , on the Riviera . Are you sure ? My memories are organised around my holidays . You 'll be in a sort of sphere . When you return you must wait four minutes to recover . Four minutes ? Why ? I 'll explain . In a way , we could compare it to the decompression chamber that divers use . Are you interested ? - Not much . Why the past instead of the future ? Wouldn 't it be more interesting ? I agree with you . The result may not seem very spectacular But for the moment we can 't go further . So we 've started with only small steps . An experience that barely seems interesting . No heart problems ? Nothing , not even a small ulcer ? You 're quite healthy . You see , suicide is good for your health . You 'll have to stay here for a few days . On some kind of diet ? Sort of . Only for four days . Will I have to sign a release before the experiment ? I suppose so . If something goes wrong , you could say I died in hospital . Absolutely . Good thinking . Was it your first suicide ? - Yes . With a gun ? - Yes . I can 't imagine you with a gun . - Neither can I. That 's why I failed . Are you afraid ? - No . I 've been afraid all my life ... But not anymore . Do you sleep well ? - Very well . No headaches ? - No . We 'll see tomorrow . I have to observe the effects of T. 5 . Doesn 't seem to hurt you . Now we just have to wait . - Three more days . What will happen to me if I stay for years ? It will only last 60 seconds . We know because of the mice . Can I go in ? I won 't wake up among pirates ? You 'll lie down . We 'll close the door . You 'll go back one year , then come back here a minute later . Disappointed ? A bit . I expected a kind of ... laboratory . Something electric . What if , for example ... it fails ? Impossible . You 'll go back to September 5 , 1966 at precisely 4 p.m. Why 4 p.m. ? It 's the time we chose . We always sent the mice at that time ... And they always came back . - It became a habit . I never thought that scientists would be superstitious ! Why was I chosen , I wonder ? Let 's say our computer chose you . Out of millions , of course . - Sure . - Good morning . - Good morning . There 's nothing to worry about . As we increase the dose of T.5. , you 'll sleep more and more . I talk in my sleep . That is also an effect of T.5. And when you wake up ? I feel all right . Tomorrow , one hour before entering the sphere ... we will inject you with a large dose of T.5. You 'll be drugged but perfectly lucid . Don 't worry . The treatment has prepared you for this stage . Will I be able to move ? The experiment requires that the subject be completely passive . But you will be able to remember . Asleep but awake . Is it good ? Coming ? - Later Two sea snakes and a few sharks . That 's about all . - Is it good ? - Very good . Did you see many fish ? Two sea snakes and a few sharks . That 's about all . I don 't like that apparatus . You always say that . Was it good ? - Yes . Did you see many fish ? Let 's go out for dinner . If you want to . Coming ? Later . It couldn 't end any other way . About 4 months . How long will dedicate yourself to packing ? As long as there are things to send . It seems you 've developed a good reputation in packing .. I believe we could use that energy better in something else . You could manage a line , hold a responsible position . I hate responsibility . I felt the same at your age . C 'mon , let 's have a coffee . Rich family ? - Pretty well off , yes . At your age I had debts . - Is it good ? - Very good . See many fish ? Two sea snakes and a few sharks . We 've lost him . Every time , the same thing . What time did she come ? - At nine . If we want to send out those 5,000 circulars by this afternoon , everyone will have to work . Imagine , she hasn 't even done 100 yet ! In four hours ? One envelope for each 2 minutes . Quite a performance . It 's a record . Is she pretty ? Who ? The record-breaker . In a way . - In a way ? Send her in . Left . See , even your car is a problem . Shall we stop for lunch in an hour ? If you like . I don 't know . Something about Catherine bothers me . Perhaps the fact that you don 't unsettle her ? You 're a quiet sort aren 't you ? - When I have nothing to say , yes . What did you do when you met her ? - Nothing . And now ? - Not much . Not much . Let 's stop here to eat . The effect of the T. 5. is weak anyway . Seven minutes . - He 's come back 5 times already . The transition period always scares me . Why not get him out before the four minutes are up ? Because he could stay like that for weeks . We 'll wait . - If we wait he 'll starve . It 's odd to see it all from a heated train . Was it cold ? Very cold . In a few minutes we 'll pass a town I liberated . Were you alone ? - Almost . We were about 50 against many Germans . Guns don 't suit you . I never got used to them . There might be a street with your name on it . It wasn 't so amusing back then . Why didn 't you come on Wednesday ? - I forgot . Come tonight , both of you . Which two ? - You and Catherine . It 'll be difficult . We 've separated . How long were you together for ? - Seven years . Come alone if you like , then . Aren 't you afraid of having that dirty wall behind you ? The papers on the table scare me more . We should redecorate your office . Paintings and tapestries . In your office , for example , a big picture of an unpaid bill dated February 17 , 1951 . The bookkeeper removed a heap of commas . He is struggling against effectiveness . An eraser and no pencil ? I hate pencils . And the rubbers ? - No . Because they are useless without a pencil . Hello - Hello Compliments of the author ... Compliments of the author ... You don 't have much imagination . I don 't know her . I don 't know what to say . A swimmer got drowned . Is he dead ? - For a good while . He was a good swimmer . He must have swum for hours before he drowned . For hours , you realize ? - Claude . Be quiet . You do not need me . You only need what is right here . You could have me embalmed and put in a corner . But I 'm alive , I move , come , go , see people . If I didn 't , I 'd kill myself . The more I give you , the worse you get . I don 't think I understand you anymore . I 'm leaving . Tomorrow , I am leaving . It 's 3 p.m. However , there are still 3 hours to go . 3 minutes ago it was 3 p. m . In 3 weeks it will be 3 p. m . In a century too . Time passes for everybody but for me stuck in this room It doesn 't pass . Search for your time . It 's 3 p. m. forever . Hello ? Hello ... On the third beep it will be exactly ... Exactly three o 'clock , zero minutes , zero seconds . Pardon ? All right tomorrow at the same time , as we agreed . Love to the family . For 100 million years the Earth belonged to algae and molluscs and then reptiles ruled the earth until this company I 'm working for was created . I believe that I 'm travelling from birth to death at 100,000 kph The earth will spin for millions of years more without me ... And as a result , I 'm here , using a pencil to express our sincere regrets to a customer for the loss of his shipment sent on the fourth ... and to tell him that we 'll do all we can to ... Ready ? Yes . What ? What 's a mouse doing here ? Did you say something ? - No . I just saw a mouse . - So ? Have you ever seen a mouse on a beach ! Maybe it 's on vacation . How was it ? In a sense it was successful . He isn 't dead . On the other hand ... A time race . Office time against outside time . Who 's winning ? Don 't know yet . She 's pretty , yes , looks like your kind . Beautiful , clean , modest ... Things that I despise . - You like me because you hate almost everything . I like things that are changeable . Am I changeable ? Not really . Not absolutely . Rather , you are ... surprising . A swamp . A dark night ... One would rather wring your neck than smile at you or slowly melt into you ... .. and sink . I can 't imagine Monique outside your window . You reek of low tide ... drownings , octopus . Behind , this beach . - This beach is me ... I need you . I have needed you since in the office they told me of a girl who hated envelopes . ... and work . Let 's make love . Here , on the sand ? I 'd run away to a land without nights ... You know what ? Your wife has a nice behind . I 'll tell you what you see right now . You 're by a window , no ? Let me see ... Everything is blue the sea , the sand , the town ... Even the people are blue ... And the many beautiful girls that caught your attention ... I miss you Claude ... It both bothers me , knowing that I miss you . It 's the first time ... I was always unaffected . I was always indifferent to the presence or absence of things Perhaps there 's a white sail in the distance . I also see some seagulls spiralling down to the beach . Are there any on the Costa Azul ? They bring rain ... It never rains there . We 're wasting time , Ridder . We 'll never finish the circulars tonight . And you keep turning that crank . It 's always beautiful . - It 's beautiful . Here nature doesn 't have that ugly green of the countryside . Coming ? Later . And if I 'd been married ? - I do not know what would have done . I wouldn 't have cared , surely . When I met you , I felt nothing special . It was a matter of ... your being different . You were really out of your element at the office . I knew the rest didn 't matter . You could have been indifferent . - No , not at all . I was so scared that night , when we left the restaurant . Did you quit your job for no other reason than to impress me ? Yes . Were you impressed ? Were you making good money ? A living . Have I told you that your eyes are beautiful ? And I want you . - Me too . See ? We are not pioneers . Shall we answer ? No . Catherine , I love you . Do you hear me ? I love you . It was the only reason . Long before you died . And now I 'm dead . I 'm cold . I hear my own words . It 's the drug ... What are my chances of surviving ? Ah , yes , 100 % if I were a mouse . I am a mouse then , if I 'm alive . They 'll come now . There 's still four minutes to wait . And the mouse ? Where 's the mouse ? You 're delirious ! Unfortunately not . Claude , please stop . You 're scaring me . I don 't mean to . I killed Catherine two months ago in Glasgow . I went with her without telling anyone , and I came back alone . I don 't believe you . You 're both right and wrong . What do you mean ? You 're right . I 'm not capable of killing . But you 're wrong , because I did . Impossible . I thought so too . What can we do ? We won 't get out of here until they do away with trams . Buses are just as bad . Cars will be useless soon . I 'll give you some advice , sir . I 'd recommend that you hop out and take the tram otherwise , you 'll miss your train . Have you got time , sir ? We 'll have to cook the cat 's eyes . What ? - We have a cat , don 't we . Are psychoses red ? - No . The future is red . And psychoses ? I get them mixed up . Are you awake too ? Go to the office for me . I need you . - I 'm hard to live with . I don 't want to live with you . I want to be with you . I want you to stay with me tonight . Don 't leave me . I 'm afraid ... - Afraid ? Yes , I 'm afraid of losing you . Of finding myself alone tomorrow . Of being without you tonight . If you like , we could spend the night in ... Last time he stayed in the sphere for one minute 29 . He arrived at 4 minutes 23 . Now he 's been gone for 3 minutes and 4 seconds ... He 's trapped in that minute , reliving it endlessly . That 's what gives us the best chance of bringing him back . I couldn 't stay there . Stay here if you like . - No , I 'm going home . Aren 't you sleepy ? She 'd be sad if you didn 't come . Sad ? She 's always sad when I 'm there ... when I 'm not ... ... when she 's asleep ... when she 's awake ... Sometimes I think she 's sadness personified . You should be used to it , after five years . I think of leaving her . I can 't help her . Nobody can help her . She needs you . That doesn 't help . Could you leave her ? Probably not . Sometimes I can 't stand it . I feel oxidized ... Once I left ... - But you returned . Yes , after 2 days . She greeted me as if I 'd been to the cinema and asked if I had eaten well . Claude Ridder , you 've had it . At the time , she wanted to have a house by the sea but was never sadder than when we went to the Riviera . Perhaps she doesn 't like the sun . She loves the sun , but she can 't help thinking that one day it won 't exist . You can 't live with her or without her . And so God created the Earth , looked at it and said : " I 'm just waiting for it to turn " . You go to sleep . I 'm not sleepy . You 're not good at that . Not especially . I don 't write anything . This job doesn 't suit you . No job does . Offices make me sick . They make you sick ? - Yes . Do you know what you 've earned this morning ? - No . Exactly 14 francs . Enough for a pack of cigarettes Not much , especially because I won 't be back after lunch . Did you expect to make money in just one morning ? For how long ? I don 't know . A day ... till tomorrow . Okay . Here 's what we 'll do ... I 'll give you the 14 francs I owe you ... And you ask me to lunch with that small fortune . Why ? - Because it doesn 't interest me . You never buy anything . I do . Bread , milk , matches , vegetables , tomatoes , mustard ... Nothing for you . - I don 't need anything . You could buy a sweater ... - I 've already got 2 . That 's not much , is it ? No visits ? - No . I don 't want to see anyone . How about we stay out all night ... We go to bed very late . That 's different . Hello . How are you today ? Is it good ? Very good . Something 's gone wrong . I don 't know what time it is . They didn 't give me a watch . That 's the limit . There aren 't watches for time travelling . I could count the seconds to calm myself . 4 minutes ... one ... two ... three four ... five ... No . - What d 'you mean ' no ' ? No . - But what kind of ' no ' ? Just ' no ' . Why not ? - Because no . Because not yes ? Yes . - Ah , but you said ' yes ' ! But no . - She sure knows how to say ' no ' . Can 't they tell ? I 'm here ! They must know it ! I 'm back ! I 'm here ! One travels for a few minutes , and centuries have passed outside . Those responsible died long ago and I 'm here forgotten . One minute . - We 'll get him back in three minutes . Oh , there you are ! How have you been ? You 're on a trip too . Did it go well ? Did you go far away ? They can 't get you back either . We 're both in a mess . I know you . You 're the mouse I saw on the beach . You caught my eye . You wander through my past here and there . What would you say if I wandered through yours ? In the end , you see , everything can be explained . Everything is reasonable . You don 't have a watch either . You don 't know how long we 've been here for either . It 's continuing . I have to get out of here ! I have to concentrate . It 's 10 : 30 , you know I feel awful . - Are you sick ? If Catherine had died , we 'd have heard about it . It 's not impossible . It 's so simple . Do you know anything about Catherine ? You 've been telling me about her for years . But have you met her ? Have you ever seen her ? No , never . The few people I knew never saw her . It 's been years since I 've seen them . They don 't even know if I live with her or not . You hid her . - People bored her . She had family ? No , no cousins , no friends . ... no boss , no job ... She didn 't even pay taxes . To go overseas , she needed papers , and she didn 't have any . No one worried about her disappearance . No . Nobody . People think we 've separated , just as you did . You left her there ? Why bring her back ? Why tell me all this ? Because nobody knows . You see what you 're doing , you let me caress you ... You 'd make love to me . Yet you say you love that man . I am , you are , he is , we love each other , you love , they lie down . I caress ... your knees . Then your thighs . Because tonight I feel abandoned . Abandoned ... If Catherine left me I 'd be thrilled . I once knew a man ... You are not listening . I 'm listening to your fingers . Since last week you 've had a different expression . Because last week I was sure that I wouldn 't write to you again . You said the same thing last year . I 'll show you something you 'll like . Is it big ? - No it 's actually tiny . You 'll like it because it 's tiny . Animal , vegetable . astral or mineral ? A mixture . I want to stay with you tonight . What 's wrong ? - I 'm terrified . Don 't say ' terrified ' . You 're just afraid . For no reason . What 's the difference between 'afraid ' and ' terrified ' ? Fear is when you feel hot . Terror is when you feel cold . You haven 't shut your eyes more than one or two hours . You need to sleep . One of my eyes wants to read and the other wants to sleep . You are absolutely I don 't know what ... But you are it absolutely . Now I 'm afraid too . - Of what , of dying ? Not exactly . I 'm afraid of not dying . - I 've never heard such a thing . You still here ? Will you be out late ? Yes . He lives quite far away . It 's too hot in here . Come with me . I 've called a taxi . Glasgow is too gloomy . Buy me some oranges . Are you okay ? - Yes . Can 't you sleep ? I wanted the light on . Here , come close to me . Simple things are harder to understand . But you did go to school . Yes , but I never listened . But you read , don 't you ? Books don 't teach everything . One day Claude told me the electric cable kept the streetcars from falling off the tracks . I 'd never thought of it . I thought they ran on gas . It 's all right . It 's what they call " The Martian Viewpoint " . Missed by two minutes . - It 's as bad as two months . The T. 5. has worn off by now . Three circulars at least . We 've received complaints about it . Better write a new text . You 'll have it next week . The release for the seventeenth . Five days more , the twenty second ... . It 'll have to be out after the 25th to meet the payments . We haven 't talked about the number of pages yet . How many ? If we have 40 pages more , It won 't cost be the same price . It needs to be cut back . Who 'll take care of it ? We still can 't send them before the 17th . Mouse B travelled in time . He 's been 1 minute into the past . A hero ! When ? Yesterday . With no ill effects . How do you know it really happened ? That 's the problem ... If during the war someone had told me that I 'd be talking about this ... Where are you going ? I 'll go buy some cigarettes . What are you doing here ? What ? What are you doing here ? I couldn 't sleep . I was afraid I 'd die . So I came here . Tomorrow , when you go out , you 'd have found me dead on the stairs , ... or simply sleeping . Come with me . Come . I found a girl I didn 't know in the bathroom ... She was very attractive . Every man 's dream . Nothing happened . I just washed her as she asked me to . Have you seen her again ? - Often , in my dreams . We accolege reseat of your of the 2nd ... Happy to learn that you never deceived our watchamacallit ... We 'll fend you a new one and cope it alives chafely ... Except our exclusives . Yours , screwly , Claude Ridder . I killed Catherine in Glasgow 2 months ago . It 's late . We needed it yesterday . We can work all night . How can he work without a pencil ? - It 's his custom . Does he know we need it for tomorrow ? Only his is lacking . Can 't spell " tomorrow " . It 's late . Isn 't he tired ? And this mark ? Has he seen this mark ? You 're right about the colour green and the countryside . And if man were allergic to the colour green ? Perhaps it 's green which ruins our cells . Thousands of scientists invent can openers , detergents ... and bypass this , which would change everything . I believe that 's the secret . It 's so simple that no one has thought of it . We 'll give up salad for a month to test it . If you buy a boat , I 'll learn to steer ... If I weren 't sad for this reason , I 'd find another . I 'm just a burden for you . If I only had money ... I don 't know if I 'd have liked you if you were rich . I 'd have pretend to be poor and disinherited . I 'd have gone to see your boss ... to arrange for him to give you some money . Oh ! A tree ! It 's not a tree ; it 's a weed . Yes , but the trees are appearing less frequently I showed you a rubber tree that you missed . Are you sure ? Are you sure ? - Yes . Okay , leave the other one , and take that one . Yes , it 's better . - I 'll tell them . But the other one ... I assure you I 'm not mistaken . It was you got me my false papers during the war . I don 't know you . Don 't you know me ? My name is Claude Ridder . I was called Claude Rabois in 1943 . You can 't know me . I had false papers too during the war . You have a calcite . Is it serious ? Not terribly . You killed her all the same . That 'll be 90 francs . Shall I come back ? Are you tired ? - Yes , exhausted . What have you been doing ? - Nothing . I listened to people talking . Didn 't you talk ? - I didn 't say a word . What did they talk about ? Nothing . I wasn 't listening . What are you looking for ? - Something to eat . I bought spinach . Plants ... I 'd like huge herring . I can 't do anything . I wonder , who are you in reality ? Something blurred more and more blurred ... I shrink in water . You never tell me what you write about . I don 't write much . If you like we can go together to eat . What worries me is that if you killed her , it was the perfect crime . It 'll be closed . Okay , I 'll go and get dressed . I like it when you wear mauve . Imagine for a moment if God had created the cat in His own image ? The cat ? - Yes , the cat . Then after a thousand years , or a few hours , I don 't know , He created man ... Man ? - Yes , man with the only object of serving the cat , like a slave . Like a slave ? - Exactly . The cat received lucidity ... And man received neuroses and the passion for making and owning things . I see . - No , you don 't see anything . Man was created for the cat 's sake . Do you understand ? - Yes , yes , I get it . There you have it . All of the civilisation that he has constructed has no other aim than to feed and comfort the cat . The cat . - Exactly . He invented lots of things , ... only for the cat 's wellbeing . Fishermen , cushions , carpet and the radiators ... Maybe even the radio , because cats love music . I 'm glad to know you 've discovered who we are and why we 're here . So am I , but you see , it 's all a question of thinking . Claude ! Look ! What is it ? A beetle . You 've been like this for two hours . What 's the matter ? Nothing 's the matter . Where 's the cat ? Did she sleep with you ? Does it annoy you ? And you , do you find it amusing ? You have a side that 's very superficial . I always dreamed of having something with an especially inept employee ... Fire her ... and escape with her . I promise , once my three months notice are through , we 'll go together ... somewhere . And after that ? Then we 'll come back ... Come back . Another coffee ? I 'd like to know how was it that I was picked for this ? Let 's say a computer did it . Out of millions , obviously . - Of course . Good afternoon . - Good afternoon . Our oldest employee . Maybe he 's the computer who picked me . This will do it good . It needs refreshment . Could you imagine being buried all alone in this cold dirt ? You could do a guide to graveyards . It would be a best-seller . Luceram cemetery . One shinbone . Modest , but good location . Another one : Three shinbones . Worth a detour . No shinbone . Avoid . I 'd rather live here than die here . These situations only occur in books . And when they occur , one doesn 't take advantage . - That 's still to be seen . I don 't mean to scare you . I killed Catherine in Glasgow two months ago . I went with her without telling anybody and I came back alone . I don 't believe it . You 're right and wrong . What does that mean ? You 're right , I 'm not capable of killing , but you 're wrong because I still did it . Impossible . That 's what I thought too . That day , it was very cold in Glasgow . Catherine had never gone that far before . Me either . She didn 't like the city ; she thought it gloomy . I think I 'd never seen Catherine as depressed as she was that day . She was absolutely ... We haven 't slept all night . I 'll be exhausted tomorrow . Let 's try to sleep a little . It 's strange to wake up exactly when I was planning to sleep again . She was asleep . And the strange thing was that she was smiling ... in her sleep . I 'd never seen he smiling in her sleep . It was the first time . She looked relaxed ... happy . That 's how it all happened . I looked at Catherine ... 29 minutes . What have you decided ? And the risks ? We must try whatever we can because the T.5. is no longer working . Are you Mr. Ridder ? Yes , that 's me . Wiana went out . She went to the post-office . That 's alright . I 'll wait . Come in if you like . We 're two girls here in the bathroom . Which one will you take ? The one on the right or on the left ? The left one . Or if not ... No . The one on the left . You chose badly . I 'm Nicole . I arrived yesterday . Do you mind if I take a bath ? Wash my back while we talk . What do you do at the office ? Sometimes I think . I pick up an object and I start to think . Here is a pen . I concentrate and I see that it 's a red pencil . It 's red on the outside but it writes black . Proof that appearances are deceiving . It 's of normal size ; a common pencil of the kind found everywhere . It has a point like a pencil . When you push it , It rolls like a pencil , naturally . If you hold it up it looks like the trunk of a tree , smooth and straight ... In the same way , it also looks like a pencil . So it would seem that we are dealing with a pencil On the other hand , I never use a pencil Why would I have one in this case ? Doubtless because tables are meant for holding pencils . I like your story . Keep going . There are other things apart from pencils . There are also erasers , pads , paper ... She has received over 150 letters of complaint . And she has them piled up there . They said there were 300 letters that were late . And now ? We 've caught up . - Even a bit ahead . Claude told me this morning that he 'd responded to a letter that we haven 't got yet . I 'm absolutely exhausted . I hardly slept 3 hours last night . And besides that , I dreamed that I had to do 100 pages . It 's going to be a nice day . One knows these things by the sea . If people are up , it 's ... Everything 's ready . Is it much ? - 5 whole years . It 'll be a few days . Even though I make love to other girls , I feel drawn to you . It 's hurtful that you do it with other girls . I don 't know what to say . Do you understand ? Yes , Claude , I do . That 's why I 'm sad . If Prometheus didn 't have his vulture ... Speaking of vultures , I bought a chicken for tonight . I don 't know what to do . I can 't get down to work . Move about , I don 't know , do something . What did I do this morning ? I kept watching the telephone . What does that girl have ? Nothing . But I want her . I 'd do anything for her . Including sending Catherine to hell . Well , call her . I don 't have her number . All I can do is wait . A kiss ? I won 't be able to stand it . - I 'd like it very much . He 's all right . - He 's completely immobilised . Let 's wait a bit longer . The minute flees , but I look for it . I concentrate on that minute . I 'm in the water . The sun 's hot ... Catherine is there , on the beach . The water 's warm ... I swim in it . I see the bottom . I want to swim . Thank you . Sorry , I don 't speak French . But you understand English , I hope . Yes , without a problem . Then where is Catherine ? Catherine ! In the end ... - Yes , in the end ... Nothing ... Do you have to go ? I should . Stay with me . I can 't find an excuse every day . I 'll write you an encyclopaedia with all the excuses you can use . You 're already late . Like every day , punctually late , never more than an hour . And occasionally less . Seen many fish ? 2 sea snakes , some sharks ... Nothing at all . Nothing changes . It 's strange . I 'm going to die . Catherine ... Do you realise ? ... you were right . Catherine ... I 'd like to see the mouse . He 's coming back more often . An interval of 30 seconds since last time . That 's not much . A storm at 7 a.m. is unusual . People get up early . Who ? God ... the workers ... You don 't understand ... - Not today . You 're lucky . You 're all blind . People are scared because they have a hard life , discouraging . In those moments , they should be convinced of the reverse . I doubt it . It won 't last . Finally , it goes by fast . When you 're okay , that 's when it 's scary ... You know that one day it 'll all be lost , and it 's unsupportable . It 's unsupportable , and the rest doesn 't matter . When you 're hungry , time drags ... It takes 3 months or 60 years to die ... It 's strange , isn 't it ? One even adapts to cancer . Choose something ... Carrots are good for the skin . After ... Spinach for influenza ... Fruit , of course , is good for your health . I don 't think I can help you . I wish I 'd never met you . That can 't be changed . Something to drink ? - I can 't drink ; it makes me sleepy . Have you been here long ? Hello , how are you ? There it is ; we can work now . We haven 't brought all the documents . Hello , cat ... I 'm happy to see you . Have you eaten well today ? 'I tell you this woman doesn 't give me enough to eat . ' Yes , I think she 's a bit stingy . 'Stingy . ' But on the street , you 'd have less to eat . 'That 's no reason for me to starve in an apartment . ' You exaggerate . 'You won 't believe me if I don 't exaggerate . ' 'I don 't like your records . ' 'They 're noisy and all sound the same . ' 'I had more fun outside . I had friends there . ' We 're your friends . You can chat with us . 'But you 're not very smart . ' Sophie thinks we are . What are you reading ? Where did you find this ? What does that mean ? - I don 't know . It bores me to explain . I couldn 't care less . Why do you say that ? I don 't understand this . It has nothing to do with me . And with you ? Not me either . Then it 's a bit silly , a bit sad , depends on how you look at it . I 'm getting mixed up ... I like you a lot . I like you more than a lot . You can 't say ' more than a lot ' . You can 't say it . - But I can think it , right ? I used to wake up at night . I hated it . I stayed awake so as not to wake up . But now it 's over . I sleep until morning . I sleep well , don 't I ? Did you ever think of killing Catherine ? Many times . I believe it . - Do you ? I thought all night about what you told me . I think you told the truth . It 's possible you 've killed her without anybody knowing . And do you know why ? To end it all . To end her suffering . As you told me , She had an incurable , mortal illness , didn 't she ? The periods vary . We can 't do anything . Then everything is lost . I went there to see a writer . I was there for that . We found a room in a little hotel . We turned on the gas heater because it was a bit chilly . She 'd taken a sleeping pill . When I saw her , she was asleep , The strange thing was that she was smiling ... asleep . I 'd never seen her smiling in her sleep . It was the first time . She looked relaxed ... happy . No longer afraid of anything . That 's how it all happened . When I was going out I noticed that the room was very cold . Very cold . I smelled gas ... The heater was off , but the gas was on ... That was all . I looked at her , smiling in her sleep , and then I left . When I came back an hour later , she was dead . The cops were already there . Claude , I don 't know why you 're lying to me . Why didn 't they arrest you ? They thought it was an accident . Just like that ? It really was an accident . I lied to see if you 'd believe me . The heater must have turned off while I was outside . I returned later that night . Much later . She really died there ? Yes . For a moment I was glad though it was horrible , I was glad . Everything happened while she was asleep . She didn 't have to experience her death ... Then I realized she was no longer there , that she would never be there again . And I couldn 't stand it . It got worse and worse . What 's wrong ? - Nothing . George is dead . Which George ? Slovain . He 's dead . I know already . He died 8 months ago . You knew it ? Eight months ago . His wife wrote me a little after his death . And you didn 't tell me at all ? You were depressed , so I didn 't tell you . Can you imagine a man who , to spare his wife would hide all bad news from her . He 'd hire actors to replace ... the people who had died . He 'd buy all the newspapers so that she couldn 't get one . He 'd have to cover up the whole planet . It would cost a lot . It 's ghastly . What ? Everything . Even when you 're with me . Page 8 , first line , put " Evarista Corriego " in italics . Same page , ninth line after ' the words ' ... the word " conjugated " is lacking . With an acute accent and plural . Page 9 is all right . Page 10 , twelfth line . 'Tlön ' with diaeresis over the ' o ' . Same page , 14th line ... It has ' solipsism ' with ' c ' instead of ' s ' . Yes , it looks strange , but that 's how it is . Page 11 all okay . Page 12 , eighth , no , ninth line : " visual and tactile . " It 's been more than an hour now . We 'll never get him back . His pulse is weak . He 's lost a lot of blood . Can we move him ? Call the hospital , quick . We 'll have to check all our figures .

 TOEI COMPANY , LTD THE GOLDEN BAT Ogon Bato Where , where , where does he come from , the Golden Bat ? A shining skull , the keeper of justice His silver baton slashes through the air Go defeat the alien monsters ! Where , where , where does he come from , the Golden Bat ? Only the bats know Golden Bat Where , where , where does he come from , the Golden Bat ? The secret cape is the symbol of justice With the power to fly at mach speed The peace of Earth is in your hands Where , where , where does he come from , the Golden Bat ? Only the bats know Watching the stars ? How beautiful . Chasing criminals day after day ... I 've almost forgotten there exist such beautiful things . Please be quiet ! Oh , there it goes again . What ? It 's late , you 'd better go home . Your parents must be worried . Good heavens , Earth is in danger . What ? What to do ? At your age we all tend to day dream . Why don 't you leave matters about the stars to the Observatory up there ? Mr. Amano , it 's true . Please believe me . Mr. Kazahaya ... There 's no signs of abnormality in space at the moment . I saw it with my own eyes . I 'm impressed by how you watch the stars closely every night . But without concrete evidence ... We cannot believe an amateur 's opinion . Doctor , what 's the matter ? Well , Mr. Kazahaya is trying to scare me . He says Planet Icarus has changed its course and is bound to collide with Earth . What ? Icarus has changed its course ? Yes . Little by little , it started about a week ago . It 's going to collide with Earth . I 'm not telling a lie . Mr. Kazahaya , newspaper journalists may jump on your story . But we experts must examine the situation carefully . You understand , don 't you ? But ... We 're in the age when the human race travels to the moon . The universe is no longer such a mystery to us . Humans only know about a small corner of the universe so far . There are many mysterious things in space . Change Icarus ' course completely . All right , the planet is now heading straight toward Earth . Earth will collide with Icarus and shatter into dust . Watch how you drive ! What are you doing ? Let go of me . I said let go . Who on earth are you guys ? Where are you taking me ? Where am I ? Thanks . Cap , we have a guest . Mr. Akira Kazahaya . I 'm Yamatone . Thanks for coming . Yamatone ? Never heard of you . Few people in the world know about us . We know much about you . You 're well-versed in matters of the universe and science . You 're very talented . You work at an automobile factory , and you have no family . How do you know these things ? What are you doing here anyway ? Are you plotting some evil scheme ? Is that what you think ? No one would imagine that there 's such a facility in the middle of the Japanese Alps . What on earth is this place about ? It 's a secret operation by the UN officially called the Pearl Research Institute . We conduct research to detect abnormalities that may occur on Earth . Come with me . You know how Icarus has changed its course and is bound to collide with Earth . I do . According to our calculation ... Icarus here is estimated to collide with Earth 10 days from now . On December 16 . At 8 : 23 GMT . 10 days from now . That 's right . If Icarus collides with Earth , Earth will be destroyed completely . We must do everything in our power to stop that from happening . But I don 't think it 's possible to change Icarus ' course back . It 's impossible to change its course . But we can destroy Icarus before it collides with Earth . What ? We need your talent in order to progress our research , Akira . Will you join us as a member ? Me , a member ? Help us secure the peace of Earth . Yes . Thank you . Let me introduce you to Dr. Pearl . Come with me . Oh , that 's Emily , Dr. Pearl 's granddaughter . This is Akira Kazahaya who has just become a member . Hello . Doctor , this is Akira Kazahaya . He 's agreed to join us . That 's great . We 're counting on your help , Akira . Yes . What 's this ? It 's the Super Destruction Beam Cannon . Mr. Yamatone and I put much hard work into its creation . Super Destruction Beam Cannon ? It uses a special lens to turn a beam of light created by atomic power into a heat beam that has the power of 1000 H-bombs . You know the laser beam utilizing ruby that the US army is currently developing , right ? It 's the same theory . The Beam Cannon has the power to destroy the approaching Icarus in a moment . Amazing . However , the Beam Cannon isn 't complete yet . How come ? We haven 't created the lens that endures the harsh beam . A Special Unit is searching for the material mineral right now . Cap , the Special Unit is sending an SOS , requesting help . What ? What happened ? They aren 't responding . What ? Does that mean the Unit disappeared ? The SOS originated at latitude 15 degrees and 23 minutes north longitude 172 degrees and 11 minutes west . It 's in the middle of the ocean . The unit disappeared into the ocean . Let 's go . Yes . Let me come with you . Okay , let 's go . Super Car # 2 , take off . Cap , we 're in the proximity . Got it . It 's in the ocean that they disappeared . It 's an island . Doctor , the island isn 't in the map . Let 's land and see . Prepare for landing . Yes . Over there . Yes . Hang in there ! Cap , their faces are badly burned . How awful . It means there 's someone else here . Hieroglyphics . Can you read them , Mr. Yamatone ? It 's from the Prophet John . What , the Prophet John ? Yes . It might be that this is a piece of land left of the legendary Atlantis . What , Atlantis ? It 's a continent which had an advanced civilization tens of thousands years ago . Then one day it sank to the bottom of the sea and disappeared . But how did a continent that once sank appeared again ? I don 't know . Run ! Run if you can . Wherever you run ... You 're still under my thumb . Go and kill them all . Are you all right , Doctor ? I 'm fine . Who are they ? I have no idea . Fire back at them . Doctor . Okay , let 's proceed further . Oh , Cap , it 's a dead end . What ? Shimizu . Naomi . Let 's find a way out first . It 's a temple . We 're trapped . There may be a path somewhere . We 'll split up and look . Yes . Oh ! A light 's coming in from there . More hieroglyphics . Cap , what does that say ? " Ten thousand years from now ... " ... a crisis will surely fall on human beings . " Remove the lid of this coffin then and I ... " ... the Golden Bat shall awake from the sleep of ten thousand years and fight for you . " Put a drop of water on my chest . " A drop of water ? Grandfather , the mineral detector is reacting . Now , Mr. Yamatone ... Let 's open the lid . Yes . Let 's open it . Mr. Yamatone , we finally found it . This is the mineral we were looking for . Doctor . Now we can complete the Super Destruction Beam Cannon . Earth can be saved . The skeleton 's moaning . Emily , you never know what might happen . Don 't touch it . Find a way out . Hurry up . Yes . Cap , I made a hole . A bat ! I am the Golden Bat . I have awaken from a ten thousand-year sleep and shall now fight for you . I fight for justice alone . Golden Bat . Emily . Yes . You saved me . If ever you are in danger ... Call on me , the Golden Bat . I shall always come to your aid . Now , take the mineral and hurry on . But we cannot go outside . The enemy 's waiting . I 'm the Golden Bat , keeper of justice . Get out of my sight before you 're all smashed . Oh , who 's that ? Does he mean to fight against me ? I 'll kill him . Damn it . The control tower was destroyed , and the tower is partly down . Damn you , Golden Bat . I 'll get you back for this . You out there , listen up . I 'm Nazo , the ruler of the universe . I changed the course of Planet Icarus . I won 't allow you , the human kind to exist in the universe . No one else should exist except me Nazo ! Therefore , I will destroy Earth . When Icarus collides the human race will end . Look forward to that day . Damn it , so they did it . Now , hurry and leave this island . Now that I have awaken ... Atlantis will sink to the bottom of the sea again . So long . Okay , let 's hurry . Today the UN 's Space Science Center made an announcement that seriously affects the human race . Planet Icarus has suddenly come off its orbit and is now heading straight toward Earth . If no measure is taken , Icarus will collide with Earth within a week . The Secretary General of the UN urgently summoned scientists from all nations . Oh , it 's a squirrel . This will keep any enemy from penetrating . We should stay alert nonetheless . Done . Earth will be saved now . Doctor , please destroy Icarus right away . Well , we can 't . How come ? Icarus is still tens of thousands of kilometers beyond the moon . The beam won 't reach it . Then , when will Icarus come within the shooting range ? Let me explain . Icarus is estimated to collide with Earth one week from today . When it passes the moon and nears Earth , it 'll be within the range . One more week . Doctor , let 's do a test run . All right . We 'll aim at a target satellite . Target satellite closing in . Ready to fire Super Destruction Beam Cannon . Did you see the power of the Super Destruction Beam Cannon ? We cannot conquer the universe with the Beam Cannon around . Keloid , Piranha , Jackal Obtain the Beam Cannon by all means necessary . Prepare to surface . Cap , there 's an unidentified flying object approaching . It 's strange . The object disappeared . All right , assume your position . They 'll notice us if we get any closer . Jackal , Piranha , land . There 's an ultra red security beam . The Beam Cannon 's inside . Oh , it isn 't . Damn it . What happened ? Oh , my pin . Who are you ? Help us , Golden Bat ! Doctor ! Follow them . Don 't move . Release him . Shimizu , cover the back . Yes . Drop your laser guns . Drop your guns . I 'll kill you all . Where 's Doctor ? Let 's find him . Damn them . I won 't let you get away . Damn you , Golden Bat . Take this . Cap , where 's Doctor ? Nazo took him , didn 't he ? Emily . I promise we 'll get him back . Hold on tight . That 's right , Emily . Icarus will come within the shooting range in 6 days . We can 't be crying right now . I 'm sorry . Cap , I don 't see Naomi . I wonder if she 's been kidnapped . No , she 's watching the Beam Cannon . But it 's strange . What is ? There 's been such a commotion . It 's strange she didn 't even come out . I told her not to leave the Beam Cannon no matter what . Let 's go . Yes . Cap , the Beam Cannon is gone . Oh , Naomi , wake up . Naomi . I 'm sorry , Cap . The enemy came out of the wall without warning . The enemy was ahead of us . It 's not your fault . But where 's the Beam Cannon ? They won 't be able to use it even if they took it . How come ? The lens which is the most important part from the Beam Cannon has been detached . What , really ? It was a secret between Dr. Pearl and me . I 'm glad we took the precaution . I see , I 'm glad . Cap , where did you hide the lens ? Well , I can 't really tell you . You mean you can 't trust us ? It 's not like that . Until Icarus reaches the shooting range and we ' re ready to fire ... I 'm not allowed to tell anyone . Say it ! Where is the lens for the Beam Cannon ? Say it . All right , let 's ask your body . Do it . Turn up the voltage . Are you going to tell me now ? Over my dead body . He fainted . Don 't stand there like idiots . You guys brought back a junk as if it 's something valuable . If you fail again , I 'll kill you . Wait , there 's no point in chasing it . The Golden Bat has pulled one over on us . Now he knows where we are . Move the Nazo Tower to another location . What shall we do about him ? Put him in the human copier . Go , Keloid . It 's me , Emily . Oh , Naomi . Were you having a bad dream ? Grandfather was falling deep into darkness . I had the same dream . What ? Then , can it be a message ? Has he been killed by Nazo ? No , he hasn 't , Emily . In my dream there was more to it . What ? Doctor was calling for help over by Hell Rock . He was by Hell Rock ? I feel it 's more than just a dream . Let 's go . Yes . There 's Hell Rock . Grandfather ! Grandfather ! He 's all right . I feel his pulse . Grandfather ! Doctor , where 's the Nazo Tower ? Icarus will collide with Earth in 5 days . If we can locate the Tower ... We can retrieve the Super Destruction Beam Cannon . Doctor , please remember . Doctor , how did you escape from Nazo ? I wonder what happened to Grandfather ? He must be suffering amnesia from the trauma . I suspect Nazo put him through terrible things . Poor Grandfather . Emergency . Cap , Icarus changed its speed . What ? It 's moving almost at double the original speed . It will collide with Earth 3 days from now . We now have only 3 days left . No , less than that . Our plan ... Was to use the Beam Cannon to destroy Icarus ... Once it 's passed the moon and hits the shooting range . If Icarus passes the shooting range and nears Earth then it 's too late to use the Beam Cannon . Why is that so ? Even if we destroy Icarus , Earth will be severely affected by its explosion . It 'll cause major earthquakes and tsunami . All dormant volcanoes will erupt at once . There 'll be other disasters beyond our imagination . That might be our last day on Earth . We 've got just 2 days to go . It 's impossible to make another Beam Cannon in time at this point . What to do ? The only solution is to retrieve the stolen Beam Cannon . But how ? Don 't know . There 's Icarus . That 's Icarus over there . It 's moving real fast . It 's not here . Where did they hide the lens ? Emily , what 's the matter ? Why are you looking at me like that ? You aren 't Grandfather . Grandfather should know where the lens is . Now that you 've found out who I really am , I can 't let you go . Help me , Golden Bat . Oh , little bat ! Shut up . Go to sleep . Oh , Emily ! Grandfather ! I 've caught the bat . Jackal , kill Emily . Stop it , stop it ! Grandfather ! Grandfather ! What are you doing ? Stop it ! What are you doing to the child ? Tell us where the lens is , and I 'll stop Icarus and save Earth . Kill me . Where 's the lens ? I don 't know . I don 't . Do you want your grandchild killed ? If you tell us where the lens is , I 'll stop Icarus and save Earth . I won 't trust you . Emily ! Emily ! Even if Earth has to perish , we can 't let Nazo have the lens . If it ever fell in his hands ... He 'd use the Beam Cannon to terrorize the universe . All right ? Will you please understand , Emily ? I do , Grandfather . Murderer ! Jackal , throw both of them in the cell . All right . I 'm just going to accelerate the speed of Icarus and let it collide with Earth quickly . Bring its speed up to the max . Icarus destroyed the moon and will reach the shooting range tonight . But now all we can do is to grind our teeth ... And simply watch Icarus come in the shooting range . If Icarus continues to move at the current speed it will collide with Earth tomorrow evening . Counting backwards from that point the computer calculated the latest possible time to destroy Icarus using Beam Cannon with no impact on Earth will be 12 o 'clock at noon tomorrow . If we fail to retrieve the Beam Cannon from Nazo by then ... Earth will be destroyed and the human race will be wiped out . Do we really have the lens ? We do . As long as the lens is in our hand , we aren 't defeated yet . Nazo is hesitant to destroy this center because he wants the lens . Got it . You guys go in the Super Car right now . Go around the world and find out where the Nazo Tower is located . Yes . Cap , where on earth is the lens ? It 's inside the center . Inside the center . Where is it ? Hide a man in the crowd , hide a leaf in the woods . You 've heard the proverb , right ? It sounds like a riddle . At last you 've fallen in the trap . What , a trap ? It isn 't the mineral detector , but a Geiger counter . Take a good look . We placed a Geiger counter in Doctor 's room to trick you . And placed radioactive material in there . Since you brought the Doctor 's impersonator here ... I was suspicious of you . When did you switch with Naomi ? When we stole the Beam Cannon from you . Where 's the Nazo Tower ? Where 's the Nazo Tower ? Say it ! Shimizu , Nakamura , Kumano , Tsuzuki ! Chase her ! Yes . I 'll chase her from outside . Damn it . Follow her . Yes . Damn it , it 's Nazo . All right , let 's follow her by car . Cap , they aren 't responding . Oh , that 's Mr. Shimizu 's car . Oh , no one 's here . It 's them . This road leads to Tokyo . Damn it , where 's the Nazo Tower ? Piranha , did you get the lens ? Well ... What , you failed ? The lens is nowhere in the center . No excuses . Please hold on . If it isn 't in the center , I suspect a third party has it . A third party ? Golden Bat . What , the Golden Bat ? That 's the only logical explanation . I see , it 's the Golden Bat . Damn Yamatone , I guess he found a good hiding place . However , Piranha ... Yamatone saw you through and you failed . Please forgive me . I won 't forgive any failure . We 've captured them . What shall we do with them ? Let 's use them as tools to steal the lens from the Golden Bat . Get the Golden Bat here . What ? Get the Golden Bat here ? That 's dangerous . I ask you please to reconsider . Idiot ! Do you think Nazo the ruler of the universe can lose to the Golden Bat ? I 'll show him how powerful I am . Get him right now . But how can we get him ? Get Emily to summon him . Release the bat from the cage . Oh , the bat . How did you escape from there ? Little bat , please call the Golden Bat here . Help us out , please . Damn it , so it was here . Oh , a bat . Let 's go . You made it , Golden Bat . Nazo , I won 't let you get away this time . Listen , Golden Bat . Hand me the lens for the Super Destruction Beam Cannon which Yamatone gave you . Or I 'll kill the hostage one by one . Damn you , Nazo . Golden Bat , your resistance will only create more casualties . Wait . Please wait . Golden Bat , give them the lens . I can 't let more people die . I 'll give you the lens . So stop killing the hostage . Catch it . Here 's the lens . They finally surrendered . Jackal , use the flying sub to destroy the Golden Bat . Yamatone , the Super Destruction Beam Cannon is now in my hand . But I won 't stop Icarus for you . I will sit back and watch the last moments of Earth . Icarus will move beyond the shooting range in the next hour . Golden Bat , can you do something about this ? Oh , a flying sub . I will win . The Golden Bat is on the hull . Get him off the ship . What 's happening with the Golden Bat ? Golden Bat . Receive the baton of justice . Are we ready to depart ? Any moment now . Hurry up . If we don 't hurry , the colliding Icarus will destroy us too . Have you gone out of your mind , you fool ? Why are you shooting at your ally ? You won 't affect the tower a bit . Nazo , take this . I 'll slam the ship into you . Fool , stop it , it 's coming at us . All right ! Oh , Cap , the entrance to the tower is open . Let 's get the Beam Cannon back . We can still destroy Icarus . Yes . What 's going on ? Why aren 't we taking off now ? We can 't . The sub crashed into the base of the tower and we got stuck . Idiot ! Please stop Icarus . Even I cannot stop Icarus . It 's almost here . We have 10 minutes left to leave Earth . Can 't you find an emergency measure ? Let 's find the Beam Cannon . Yes . Oh , it 's a bat . All right , let 's go . Doctor . Mr. Yamatone . Oh , Emily . We 're running out of time . Quick , unlock them . Yes . Oh , Naomi ! Takuya ! Hurry up . Yes . Get them ! Kill them ! Damn it ! Kill them all ! Golden Bat ! Golden Bat ... Get him ! Golden Bat ! I 'll take care of the Beam Cannon . Leave here at once . Okay . Let 's hurry . Let 's hurry . We 've got to depart Earth at once or we 'll be in danger . What 's happening with the emergency measure ? Respond . Oh , Golden Bat . Nazo , accept that your time has come . What ? In any age , in any situation , the evil has never flourished . Shut up . Get him . See the power of the Golden Bat . Take this , Nazo . Turning your back on me , Nazo ? The self destruction device has been set off . Let 's see . Golden Bat . Golden Bat . Here 's the Super Destruction Beam Cannon . Thank you . Shimizu , set it up right away . Yes . Ready to fire . Ready to fire . Mr. Yamatone . Doctor . A great success . Golden Bat , thank you . " He who attempts to conquer the world with power ... " ... shall die by his own power . " Emily , it 's time for us to part . What ? Farewell . Golden Bat ! Goodbye , Golden Bat ! Goodbye , Golden Bat ! Golden Bat ! Goodbye , Golden Bat !

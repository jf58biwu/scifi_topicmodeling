Tuesday , February 3 The wreckage of La Galante , a French steamer lost off Spitzberg in 1905 , ☻ is found not far from the body of the unknown man .

[ Dan ] We 're going live to the Poliquen hospital for a press conference by Prof. Édouard Loriebat , a specialist in artificial hibernation . Professor Loriebat and Prof. Barkov , head of the psychiatric department , take their places before journalists from the world over . Ladies and gentlemen . I am now able to confirm certain rumours circulating since this afternoon . After 36 hours of gradual thawing , Dr. Barkoff and I have detected renewed cardiac activity . [ Oh ! Ah ! ] - Fantastic , dear ! Don 't you think ? - It 's crazy ! - Crazy ! Within several hours , the metabolism regained its normal rate . And as I speak , the subject can be considered physiologically dehibernated . - My dear ! - It 's crazy ! Professor , to explain this unique act of survival , [ Eng ] what hypothesis can you advance , personally ? In 1905 , the Cargo / Passenger vessel La Galante was transporting barrels of glycerin . Upon collision with an iceberg , probably the ice man 's body was immersed in the product , and thereby put in a Flash-frozen state . Glycerin would also have protected his cellular structures by preventing their rupture . Oh la la ! Formidable , Thomas , don 't you think ? What ? ! They find the intact body of a man frozen 65 years ago , they thaw him out and he 's alive . That doesn 't amaze you , M. Thomas ? The hibernator is out of danger . Alright . Never mind ... Dear friends , let 's get back to why we 're here , tonight . As Director of the French Packaging Company for almost 25 years , I 've always pursued one goal : to respect , serve and spoil my good , loyal clients . And also I 've wanted to make our Paris plant worthy of the European market . It 's necessary ... We must get our French Company ... Pass ! The French Packaging Company MUST become ... No ! No ! become the company of the day AFTER tomorrow . I merely follow the example of our excellent friend Crépin-Jaujard , whose company is the pride of the French packaging industry . [ Applause ] Yes , yes ! Dear friends . It 's not only an honour but also a great joy for me to announce , on the occasion of this modest inauguration the engagement of Evelyne , daughter of M. Crépin-Jaujard , to my little Didier . Dear little Didier , son of my dear friends the De Tartas , who 've done , who 've known who 've understood , who 've felt How shall I put it ? How can I tell you ? - It 's hard to say ... - Tell me tomorrow , hm ? Look , what a lovely couple ! To your health , kids . Be happy . At least try to be .

I know my ancestors by name , surname and nickname , going back to Louis Hutin ( d.1316 ) Some fell in battle , in Christian or barbarian lands . Others died a natural death in their châteaux .

Only the ... - Get lost ! - Yes Sir . - Hey , Charles ! - Eh ? C 'mere . What ? How do I look ? Hhh ! Alright , piss off ! - Yes . - Hop it ! - Ah , Sophie ! - Ho , ho ! Sophie ! Come here . - No , leave that alone . - Fine , I 'll tell him to come . M. de Tartas , you may come . M. de Tartas ! My respects , dear madam . Welcome to our house . Monsieur . My dear friend , I told Paul of my high esteem for you and he 's dying to meet you . You 're too kind , Madame . I took the liberty of bringing a modest token of my devotion . See , how he spoils me ! You shouldn 't have . Madly gay ! Such superb flowers ! - Not too heavy ? - Not at all . Sophie ! She won 't be long . No matter . Put that on the table . - Isn 't love beautiful ! - Cut the commentary ! Indeed , Monsieur , love is a noble sentiment provided it 's sincere and profound . My mother deserves to be happy - and I 'll make sure . - Oh , Paul ! I 'm sure Monsieur understands . - Very well . Would you step into my study ? Do you mind , mama ? Certainly , you big darling ! - What ? - Pardon ? - I thought , er ... - Very well . - This way ? - Yes , this way . Ah , that 's it . Be indulgent with Paul , my dear . He adores me and can sometimes be a bit brusque . Through that door . Have a seat , please . A finger of Madeira ? No , thanks . - A Vieux Grenache ? - No , thank you . - On a diet ? - Not at all . Health problems ? Delicate stomach , sensitive liver ? No , I 'm fine , I assure you . Great . Cigar ? No , I don 't smoke . Not anymore . You have every virtue ! M. de Tartas , I won 't beat around the bush . My mother told me you 're a widower . Ah , yes , yes . What did your wife die of ? What did your wife die of ? I , um ... heard ... Oh , it was terrible . How , horrible ! Already in the morning , she was sort of ... like that . I remember , she went , arrgh ! Argh ... She swelled up and ... Paf ! She cracked , it was horrible . Ah , horrible ! The devil , you say ! Frightful . Pffft ! Paf ! She blew up , all over the place . Didn 't suffer , though . At all , at all . M. de Tartas , I like clear situations . Me too . Me too . You intend to marry my mother ? - Eh , yes . - I wouldn 't like you to rush things . - You can move in here for a while . - That 's too kind of you . You played an essential role at the factory . But from now on , I 'll take over . That 's not possible . What about your ... ? What 'll become of you ? How will you take over ? My father did one elegant thing . He left the factory in my name . I 'm young , I 'll get the hang of it . You should be careful . The doctors recommended you take it easy . You 'll get over-fatigued . - Just like that ... Exhausted ! - They 're a bunch of jack-asses ! You 're forgetting supplies problems . Administrative details . Cheques ... Cheques to sign . I 'll sign them . Ah , no , not the cheques ! - Don 't you think I 'm capable ? - You mustn 't ! Look , give me a great big Grenache , a huge glass of Madeira and I 'll smoke a fat cigar . Attention , please . [ Klaxon ] This sudden leap back in time is somehow moving , don 't you think ? Rather costly , I 'd say . Such deployment of resources for a common man is unthinkable . If he 's so common , why did you bother coming ? For you , dear . Don 't you want to see Didier ? Sure , mama . That 's the only reason . Neither curiosity nor snobbery are at issue . There he is . He 's watching . Hey ! ... He-heh , he-heh ! Still watching ... He 's gone . He thinks he inherited a petrol oil lamp factory . Keep him from running things or we 'll have a disaster . It 's his factory , what do you expect ? Tell him the truth . Enough of this comedy ! I 'm off . No , he 's back ! There he is ! Hee , hee . Ay , ay , yyy ... Ha , ha ! - You 're wrong to abuse my patience . - Without my family you 're nothing . I won 't need them much longer . Didier will marry Evelyne . And you and grandpa can play with your petrol lamps . Hubert ! - Oui ! - Hubert ! Petrol ! Hubert ! Oh , Hubert ! Hubert ! I 'm dizzy ! I don 't care ! My dear friends ! [ neighing ] Ha , ha ! - Are you hurt ? - No . Not at all , everything 's fine . Everything 's fine . We were waiting for you . Voilà , that way , please . Straight ahead . - Charming , place ! - Do you think so ? - Oh yes ! Aaah ! Oh ! Hubert , I thought we were mad at each other . - Your dress is torn , go change . - Oh ! They 're so charming ! Meditate on this example , my girl . And after 20 years of marriage ! If their son takes after them it bodes well for Evelyne . Charles , where 's Didier ? Hee hee ... Impossible ! Let me by ! Ah ! What are you doing here , in Didier 's room ? - To think , I trusted you ! - It 's no crime . It 's worse . It 's an outrage . - Here 's your week 's notice , piss off ! - I dunno if the boss will agree . - The boss is ME ! - No , it 's M. Paul . You miserable ... Trying to ruin your father , huh ? The Crépin-Jaujards are downstairs . Evelyne 's waiting . Hop to it ! Listen to to what I 'm saying . I 'm fed up to the eyebrows , with the Crépin-Jaujards . The eyebrows ? Yes , the eyebrows . And that 's not all . You can stick your fake marriage up your ... Ah , no ! Never ! Your jacket ! Allez-hop ! To the Crépin-Jaujards . I can 't wait to meet him ! I 'm afraid of making a mistake . Is it as serious as they say ? - It 'd be terrible . - Charles , please . - But it WOULD be terrible . - Charles , leave us . It could tragically stagger his reason . I beg you , be careful . - Watch out for me , Edouard . - I 've done it for 19 years , dear . - Where is your grandfather ? - Patience , he 's coming . I didn 't imagine you like this at all . When I think of your age ! - You don 't find me too young ? - Oh , no , I think you 're just fine . - Here 's our little Didier . - Bravo , Didier , superb ! My respects , madam , monsieur . - What 's wrong , is he upset ? - No , no . - Anything wrong ? - No , nothing . - Really nothing ? - No , nothing . Little Evelyne 's not here ? I thought Didier was in the park . She 's looking for him . - Shall I go ? - Yes . No ! ... I 'll go myself . ♪ [ Dramatic ] ♪ ♪ ♪ What 's wrong , dear ? Did you see my daughter ? Charles . - Did you see Evelyne ? - You didn 't see Evelyne ? - CHARLES ! - Yes , I 'm here .

Crépin-Jaujard and I have agreed on the date of the wedding , already ! - So , everything 's fine . - What ? Everything is NOT fine ! I won 't let your grandfather steal my son 's fiancée . Voilà ! What are you doing ? What do you mean ? Yes , what are you doing ? Well , I 'm ... He-heh ! What for ? Ah no ! We 're only fiancés . We 're not married yet . We don 't want people talking . Come on ! All these emotions must have gotten to you . No , Edmée , Edmée , you don 't love me anymore ! - Yes . - No ! - Yes ! But , kitten , I 'm lonely . Lonely . Too lonely ! Alright , voilà . - Yeah , but ... - Wait ! Here ... to keep you company . But , keep it muted . No . No . Edmée ! Edm ... My respects , dear madame . May the night bring you sweet repose . Edmée - Did Paul see anything ? - No . If he caught you in my room , he 'd have killed you . He thought I came to say goodnight . Thank you for your presence of mind . This charming complicity reminds me of our courting days . Your grandfather 's youth has brought back our own . Oh , Hubert . - It 's late . - No . Yes , it 's really late . It 's never too late to court one 's wife , my pet . - Enough . - My pet ! This won 't get you anywhere . My pet ! Mama ! [ * * * ] Mama ! [ * * * ] Hm ?

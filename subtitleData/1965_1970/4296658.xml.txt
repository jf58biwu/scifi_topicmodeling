 Can 't you get them under control ? Stabilize them . Ann , refine your locator . I 'm doing the best I can , General . We 're getting an interfering impulse . We 've lost ' em . - [ Men Shouting ] - [ Horses Whinnying ] I 've got Doug and Tony again . [ Men Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] Let 's try this way . Oriental . Sure is . Mongolian . Those were Mongols back there . It 's been a long time since I 've studied Oriental history , Tony , but ... if my memory serves me right ... this is the emblem of the great Khans . Genghis Khan ? [ Shouting ] [ Shouting Continues ] [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . Enough ! My men are sometimes hard . But these are hard times . I am a prince of the Mongols ... and it pains them when strangers fail to honor me . You 're Genghis Khan ? Genghis Khan is dead . The whole world knows that . I am Batu ... grandson and rightful heir . The mantle of Genghis Khan belongs to me . But I will do with it what he could not do . I will conquer the world . Asia , Europe - All will be crushed with my Mongols . Your friend is of no importance to you now . You have much to tell us . Will it come easy or hard ? The fort and its defenses - Where can we breach its walls ? I warn you . Patience is not one of our virtues . We 're travelers . We - We come from a distant place . I don 't know anything about a fort . You disappoint me . You seem like such an intelligent man . I couldn 't help you if I wanted to . You 're European . You must be with Marco Polo . Marco Polo ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . We are not known for our gentle touch . It would be wise of you to tell us all you know . - [ Groans ] - Again ! Thirteenth century . Latter part . Eastern China ... or Mongolia . Mongolia in the 1 3th century . Genghis Khan . The Golden Horde . The building of the Mongol Empire . Get a definite time fix . Let 's see exactly who it is we 're dealing with . [ Groaning ] Ann ! I 'm sorry . I just can 't stand to watch what they 're doing to him . Ann , if we 're ever gonna get them out of there alive ... we can 't do it without you . Our impulse is weakening , and we 're losing contact . - We 've lost ' em . - [ Sighs ] - It 's all my fault . I was - - It 's no one 's fault , Ann . Our initial fix just wasn 't strong enough . I 'll reestablish contact . A great victory , my lord Batu . A patrol from the fort was riding for the mountain pass . We caught them and cut them to pieces . - And the European , he was with them ? - Yes . - Good . - But he escaped with a handful of men . - What ? - They 're cut off from the fort . As good as dead . You fool ! Now ... your information becomes much more valuable . [ Gasping ] I - I don 't know anything about any fort . I swear I don 't . You will tell me the secret of its defense ... and it will fall before me like everything else will fall before me ! It is my heritage ! Genghis Khan 's empire should be mine , and it will be mine ! Why prolong their agony and your own with false heroics ? The fort has been under siege for months now . Their position is hopeless . We both know that . Tell me . Tell me the word , so that it may end quickly . The fort 's weak spot . Tell me the section of the wall that can be bridged ! I don 't - [ Groaning ] Enough ! You 've got the touch of a blacksmith . Now it 'll be hours before he can talk . Maybe never . You , stay here . You , come with me . Tony . Tony ! Make no sound . You 're not Mongol . - Who are you ? - We 're travelers . - Travelers ? - Yes , we were captured . And escaped from Batu 's camp ? Yes , if that 's what his name is . If that has happened , then all things are truly possible . The Mongols are probably tracking them at this very moment . Go . You look at the other trail . The emperor Kublai Khan has an outpost fort across the plain . I command there . I am Marco Polo of Venice . Why do you look at me so strange ? Do I seem so odd ? No . No , it 's just that , uh ... your fame has preceded you . Fame ? Me ? Why , yes . The wonders of the Orient you brought back to Europe . Why , you 're famous the world over . I have not been back to Europe ... since I began traveling through the Orient 1 2 years ago . Who are you ? Well , we 're just travelers , the same as you . And how do you know so much about me ? I was assuming . I meet a man from Venice in the service of the Kublai Khan ... the first European to explore the Orient . Why , it 's only natural for me to assume that ... the whole world knows who you are . [ Chuckles ] You have style . But your words come too smoothly and too swift to be true . Well , you 're a traveler . You must know that the truth is sometimes very hard to explain . - And sometimes , even harder to accept . - [ Chuckles ] But there is one truth that you can accept , Marco Polo ... and that is that we are your friends . Yes , you do have style ... and that 's one thing a Venetian can appreciate . Mongols are coming , following their trail . - Can your friend travel ? - Yes , I 'll see to it . I think not . - It 's a pity your journey must end here . - Wait . You can 't leave us here . You friend cannot travel quickly enough . - Will you leave him ? - No . I thought not . Loyalty is a luxury , a luxury I cannot afford at this moment . Well done . I didn 't appreciate being hung out for bait like that . Let 's not quarrel over a successful maneuver . There are enough unsuccessful ones to stew over . Besides , now we have horses for your friend . We can get him back to the safety of the fort . Memories of the rack linger . I am afraid the pain will linger also . You still haven 't told me who you are . Sarit . There must be more to it than that . Sarit doesn 't seem to be enough for a girl as beautiful as you . Well , wait . Don 't go . I 'm still a sick man , you know . I think you are now well on the road to recovery . Yeah . - Well , how are you feeling ? - All right . A little stretched . Having a nice convalescence . Yes . She is very beautiful , isn 't she ? Yeah , very . You sent for me , my lord Batu ? Marco Polo and the others are safely back inside the walls of the fort by now . We did everything we could . We searched the countryside . I did not call you here for excuses , Ambahai . [ Chuckles ] The fort has been too strong for us to take . But I have found a way to increase our power tenfold . - Princess Sarit . - But , my lord - With Kublai Khan 's daughter in my power , I can force a marriage ... make my claim that much more secure . Then all the Mongol tribesmen will join behind me in a full-scale war ... and Genghis Khan 's empire will truly be mine ! But she is safely within the walls of the fort . And you will bring her here to me . But , my lord , the walls will be guarded . Heavily guarded . We have been trying to breach those walls for months . There is a time for force and a time for cunning . I make a very impatient bridegroom . A thousand campfires and as many Mongols set to breach these walls . Well , your defenses seem strong enough , and they 've held so far . Yes . But with a Mongol , it 's always something new ... something unexpected . Wait , please . There is so much I have to tell you . Gentlemen . I 'd say we could use some privacy . Wouldn 't you ? Tony , what do you say you forget about this little walk in the moonlight ? [ Chuckles ] Since when did you start doubling as scoutmaster ? Look , I know Sarit is a beautiful girl , but stop and think where we are . We 're right in the middle of nowhere , and a thing like this can get out of hand . - Doug , man , you 're way off base . - Why don 't you face it ? - You 're getting involved . Can 't you see the signs ? - So , what of it ? Am I supposed to stop living because I 'm in the 1 3th century ? - Look , I 'm not trying to tell you how to live - - Well , then don 't . You 're wise in seeing the danger . They 're from different worlds . Nothing could ever come of it . Yes . They certainly are from different worlds . Marco ... would you be shocked to learn that Tony and I are from another world ? [ Chuckles ] No . I 'm not ridden by superstition like my Venetian colleagues . I have seen too much ... traveled too far . I mean , from the world of another time - the past or future . " " Time . " Who knows what time is ? Even Aristotle was puzzled by its nature . You are here . I can touch you . You 're in my time . And you mean that my friend and Sarit , even though they are from different times ... might fall in love ? Can they not touch each other ? Well , at least we have the year . - 1 287 . - 1 287 . Now , if we could only get exact location coordinates . Didn 't the computers have anything ? No . No exact location . Marco Polo was in the service of Kublai Khan for over a dozen years ... service ranging all over China and Mongolia . It was to have been a secret . But somehow , Batu learned her true identity . It is not merely a girl called Sarit who has been taken . - She is the Princess Sarit . - Princess ? Daughter of Kublai Khan . I was escorting the princess to Venice to study the ways of Europe . Our caravans got as far as this fort . We could get no farther . A single man might be able to get in and out of Batu 's camp just as they got in here . - I 'll need Mongol clothes . - For two . [ Sighs ] This was to be your first return trip to Europe ? Yes . Carrying goods back that you 've gathered here ... including a certain black powder . - How did you know that ? - Exploding powder , isn 't it ? No . - But you said this is your first trip . - Yes , it is . Well , then you must have the powder . I know you have it . What if I do ? Well , I could use that powder to help get Sarit back . - Use it ? How ? - As a weapon . The noise and smoke as a diversion . - A weapon ? - Yes . It might make the difference between saving and losing her . I 'll get you the Mongol clothes ... and the black powder . There 's still time for you to head back to the fort , if you want . I thought we came out here to do a job . I came out to do it . I have a personal interest here . Just how personal ? It could be that I 've found something here that interests me . It could be that you 're just trying to talk yourself into something . Maybe . Maybe not . All I know is , for the first time , I 've been thinking ... that it wouldn 't be the worst thing that ever happened ... if I didn 't get back to the Time Tunnel . They must 've really stretched you out of shape back there on that torture rack . I can think of a lot of things worse than spending the rest of my life here . That 's dream talk , Tony . What you need is something to shake you back into reality . Now , remember that everything that we 're going through - everything that 's happening to us here and now - it 's all in the past . Sarit , Marco Polo , Batu - They 're all dead ... and they 've been dead for 7 00 years . No , you 're wrong , Doug . Our present is here and now . It 's always been here and now . You 're wrong . Now , look , Sarit does not exist for us . Our reality is 1 968 . Our real existence is back in the present of the Time Tunnel Complex . And what if it 's not ? What 's to stop me if I were to make my existence here and now ? Even then , you and Sarit wouldn 't have a chance together . - Why ? - You 're from different worlds , different times . Eventually , all this nonsense would wear out ... and you 'd realize that you had both settled for a whole lot of nothing . Can it be that Tony 's really falling in love ? [ Scoffs ] Impossible . A pretty girl , a dangerous situation . Just a romantic impulse . We 're losing our fix again . - They 're fading . - We 've lost them . You know , I think he really is falling in love . Get that fix back . We 're gonna try to transfer them . Maybe we shouldn 't . Well , I mean , if he 's - If he 's found someone that he could be happy with - I mean , you know , really happy with - maybe we don 't have any right to take him away . Now , you must eat first , my princess . It would not look right for my intended bride ... to be all bones pressing on flesh . I would lose honor amongst my tribesmen . What would they say ... if they thought I ate well and you did not ? Huh ? One must have honor before it can be lost ! [ Laughs ] I approve ! I approve . You have spirit . I like it . A Mongol chieftain 's bride-to-be should have spirit . [ Shouts ] Yes , some spirit . Some . Some , but not too much , ah ? [ Laughing ] Ah ! [ Shouts ] [ Laughing ] After her ! Bring her back ! I knew you would come for me . I knew , and I was not afraid . Any objections ? And if I did have , would it , uh , make any difference ? No . This will not be the first time a friendship has been broken over a pretty girl . No . But it would be the first time that it was over a girl that neither man could win . - Well ? - We could not catch them . The princess is back inside the fort . You blundering fool ! She is the key to my joining all the tribes of Mongolia ... into one unbeatable fighting force ! I have dreamed too long of regaining all the empire that should be mine ... and dreams of conquest do not die so easily . I have a destiny to fulfill , and it will be done . I 'll have that girl back ... and I 'll destroy that fort as well . Go . Go , and send riders out . Tell them to gather all Mongol warriors ... who will fight with Batu and share in his plunder . Go ! The time gradient is coming in stronger now . There . We 're making contact again . - Mongolian horsemen . - Thousands of them . - Ray , how strong is your fix this time ? - Quite strong . Strong enough to send some artillery back to that fort ? - Send back cannons ? - Precisely . Cannons and shells . No . You 're talking about transporting several tons of equipment , General . No , the Tunnel could never handle that . Well , just some mortars . Enough shells to break up that attack . A thousand pounds at the most . I still don 't think we could handle it . Ray , that fort-Tony and Doug don 't stand a chance without help . We 're gonna try our best to give it to them . They 've been gathering for hours . How long do you think before they 'll attack ? Almost anytime now . And I 'd say the advantage is all theirs . Now , Ray ! Our time-space coordinates must 've been way off . Without artillery support , they don 't stand a chance . Run everything we have through the computers . We 've got to get an exact fix and try to transfer them to safety . Yes , sir . [ Knocking ] Batu has an army massing outside . - I can see them from my window . - You can 't stay here . I 'll talk to Marco Polo . There must be some way for you to get out . It pleases me that you worry . It gives me pleasure to see that you care . - Did you locate them ? - No . But in his memoirs , Marco Polo mentions a fort he once commanded ... in the Mongolian province of Chahar . Chahar . Did you get that , Ray ? Get the proper coordinates and zero in . No , wait . Now , to transfer Doug , yes . But I still say we have no right to try to take Tony away from there . Well , if he 's found happiness , who are we to take him from it ? Would he want us to ? Don 't be foolish , Ann . Tony is one of us . He 's from here and now . That girl is from the 1 3th century . - Nothing would ever come of it . - Are you two so completely certain of that ? I was uncertain enough to run a few questions on Sarit through the computers . The information is sketchy , but there are some things known about her . She was the only daughter of Kublai Khan ... and she married a dark-haired , fair-skinned stranger ... from a far , distant place in the year 1 287 . - They 're all dark-haired . - Yes . But are any of them fair-skinned ? Well , nobody 's gonna marry anybody unless we get some help back to that fort . [ Hoofbeats Galloping ] It 's Batu ... under a flag of truce . Bring him to my quarters . I greet you , Marco Polo . In peace ? Or in war ? In peace . It gives me great sadness that so many brave men will die this day . - A sadness matched by my own . - Then let us avoid this bloodshed . I pledge the safety of every man in this fort ... on one condition . Sarit , you hold a thousand lives in your hand . No . We can beat them off . We 'll fight . Do you take orders from homeless strangers ? I take orders from Kublai Khan and my conscience . And does your conscience say that all your men must die when they can all live ? - If you give her up - - You lie ! You 'll try to kill us either way . Will you swear that no one will be harmed ? - I give you my oath . - Yes , but will you keep it ? What of the oath you made Genghis Khan ... and your father and your brothers ? You broke them when it pleased you . You 'd break this one too . You 're right , Marco . His only goal is to conquer Asia and Europe and then the rest of the world . If you refuse me ... everyone within these walls will die . You are refused ! So be it . Ready now . Shoot ! Arrows will never stop that charge . And we can 't get any help back to them . Don 't you have a transfer fix yet ? That was an order , Ann . I want Tony and Doug transferred out of there ... and I want them transferred fast . Yes , General . The reading coming up is 1 28.3 . Good . Exact time-and-location gradients are leveling . Our fix should start coming in strong . [ Arrows Flying ] [ Screaming ] [ Shouting ] [ Shouting , Screaming ] Hold your arrows ! - That could 've been worse . - It will be . It may look like they 're retreating , but they 're not . They 're only falling back to regroup their forces . They 'll hit again . And next time , even harder . I know . We can 't surrender . We can 't retreat . That leaves only fighting . Doug . Back there in the fight - Thanks for , uh , keeping me alive . If you save a man 's life , you 're responsible for him . You have to help him ... - even if it means telling him things he doesn 't wanna hear . - You mean about Sarit ? - Yes . Can 't you understand ? - I 've been thinking about the Tunnel . What I 'm talking about has nothing to do with the Tunnel . It 's got everything to do with it . It 's not that I changed my mind or don 't know what I want . But the Tunnel , whether I like it or not , can take me out of here at any time . That 's right . There 's nothing you can do about it . So , if you really care about Sarit ... the only honest thing you can do is to say good-bye . Yeah . But what of honor ? And duty ? I say give him up . To serve what honor ? What duty ? A duty owed your father . My father . He thinks only of his armies and his empire . And so must you . The daughter of an emperor cannot follow the dictates of her heart . Why not ? Let Kublai Khan look to his sons for help . They will one day have his throne . And you - You think you can defy your fate ? Sarit , listen to me . You are a princess of Cathay . You are the only daughter of the Kublai Khan . You have a destiny to fulfill and a duty to your people . And none to myself ? I saw your moment of uncertainty ... when Batu offered to spare the fort ... if you would give yourself to him . I was thinking of - of my stranger . And not at all of the other lives in this fort ? Of them too . You see , my dear ? You cannot escape your fate - to think of those whom fate has made your subjects . The Kublai Khan needs your marriage to someone else for the good of all his people . You may waver ... but no inner feeling can make you forget ... who you are or what you must do . How can you be so sure ... when I am not ? You will do what you must . You all right ? We might not be able to hold off another assault . Marco Polo says there is always hope . Is there always hope ? No matter what happens ... it still has to be good-bye for us . Yes , you are right . It still must be good-bye . I am the daughter of Kublai Khan ... and it was wrong of me to have forgotten that , even for so brief a time . Neither of us should have forgotten . But we did ... and we had our moment . We 'll never repair that wall in time . We 'll just have to double our men there . Well , it could be worse . We lost a section of the north wall . But we still have enough men to make a defense . Yes , but for how long ? There 's nothing left to do but stand and fight . Until we 're all killed ? Batu hasn 't left us much of a choice . What if we try to win ? What if we try to break the back of their charge before they even reach that wall ? How ? By magic ? Yes , of a sorts . That black powder that you have in your storeroom . Well , that 's harmless . It 's used for fireworks and parades and festivals . Until you mix this with it . - What 's that ? - This turns that black powder into an explosive ... strong enough to blow those Mongols right off their horses . I need all the water jugs that you can find . - What is it ? - This is nitre . It was scraped from the cellar walls . Now , where we come from , it 's called by a different name . Potassium nitrate . And this 'll stop the Mongols ? Dead in their tracks . One container , one horse and rider ? Marco , if this is mixed properly ... one container will stop as many as 30 or 40 riders . Impossible . When I first saw those firecrackers of black powder ... I was amused when they crackled and popped . I smiled at the thought of what entertainment they would give my countrymen . But one container to kill 40 human beings at one time - Would you prefer that the Mongols killed us ? No . I will help you fill the containers myself . That 's fine . A good , strong fix . We 'll be able to make a transfer in another few minutes . General , I said we 'll soon be able to make a transfer . Homemade artillery shells . They 're probably gonna try to explode those containers with makeshift fuses . That 'll never do . They 'll misfire and never explode on target . If there 's one thing I hate , it 's to see perfectly good hardware wasted . We 've got to send something back to them . We 've got to ! General , you saw what happened the last time we tried . Yes , but we gotta send something lighter this time . Something under a hundred pounds . Get me Ordnance . Ordnance ? General Kirk here . I want two boxes of percussion igniters ... and I want them here in the Time Tunnel Control on the double . Are the catapults in place ? Yes . One small question . We 've got the launchers and the shells . Now , uh , how do we detonate them ? With short-burning fuses and a prayer . Well , it could work . It 's got to work . Ready , Ann ? Transfer . What 's the matter ? They weighed only half as much as the mortar and shells . Theoretically , they should transmit . Ann , what are your readings ? Power and space-time gradient plus over three . They should 've gone . Technical , on the double ! Throw the circuit breaker , but don 't lose the fix on Tony and Doug . [ Kirk ] Hold it on the tower . ! Don 't touch it . ! - Clear ? - Clear . All right , go ahead . We 're operational again . - Circuits in . - Hurry it up . - Ready . - All right . Send them . They must have a fix on us , Tony . They knew exactly what we needed . It 'll work . [ Whinnies ] Now ! Keep it up . [ Horses Whinnying ] We 're going to finish this day here and now ! [ Shouting ] Now , Ann . Transfer . What 's the trouble ? Feedback - a bad one . They 're frozen in time . If we don 't get them moving within a few seconds , they 'll be burned to death . - Can you send them back to where they were ? - Well , we can try it . - Reverse - - No ! Ah , yes.Just as I expected . Toys . Mere toys . Yes . Simple . Predictably simple . [ Chuckles ] Such a to-do about a commonplace bit of magic . Hear me , you travelers in time . It is I , Merlin , mightiest of all wizards , who commands you . At a sign from me , you will leave the limbo of time ... and appear in this place before me . Yes . Welcome , gentlemen . Welcome ... home .

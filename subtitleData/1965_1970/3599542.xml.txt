 Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on Americas greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony ewman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . Come on . Come on ! The weather on the Cherbourg Peninsula is terrible this time of year . But , then , bad weather has its advantages . It makes invasion of this part of the coast quite unlikely . Sit down . Now , make no mistake about this room , gentlemen . The room is soft , but the gestapo is not . You will cooperate . What are your names ? Im Anthony Newman , and this is Douglas Phillips . Major , we were there by mistake . Theres nothing we can tell you . You have already told me a great deal . Your accents tell me that you are American . Your inflections tell me that you are well-educated . Your presence here tells me you were dropped to help the French underground . Major Hoffman . Yes , certainly , General . I have the schedule right here . The field maneuvers are scheduled to begin on the morning ofjune 6 . - The , uh , day after tomorrow . - june 6 . My men are doing everything they can to locate the men who did it . Were gonna be sitting right in the middle of the biggest invasion in history . - He did not tell me about this . - Were on the Cherbourg Peninsula . - o , sir . ! - just 48 hours before D-day . The Time Tunnel . Thank you , General . I would be delighted to drive up with you . Bitte sehr . - Have you verified the time ? - Yes , sir . Its june 4 , 144 . The place is the Cherbourg Peninsula . Yeah , but what town , Ann ? We cant get a fix without the town . - Could it be the city of Cherbourg ? - No , Ive been in Cherbourg . This must be one of the smaller villages . Ann , get on the computer , will you , please ? I want photographs of Valognes , Montebourg and Sainte-Mére-Église . - As of the year 144 . - Yes , sir . Ray , the preinvasion barrage is going to start at midnight on the fifth ofjune . Unless we can get them out of there by then ... I wouldnt give you a nickel for their chances of staying alive . Never mind ! That is one thing about you Americans . You always have loyalty to one another . But it can be inconvenient . Can you remain silent while you watch your friend being tortured ? You wont get anything out of us , Major . They will work very nicely , Major . I still say it is a waste of time , Dr. Kleinemann . Yes , I have no doubt that , given time , you could break them . Yes , the gestapo is very good at breaking things . But how much better would it be to be able to control them ? - It will not work . - Thats not up to you to decide . I have my orders from Berlin to give you anything you want , Doctor . - I will obey them . - Of course you will obey . Because you are conditioned to obey . And thats precisely what I am going to do with one of the Americans . I will recondition one of those men ... and he will kill the other ... in cold blood ... without a moments hesitation or remorse . And that will test the usefulness of my new technique . Now , I want the man with the coat for my experiment ... and you will allow the other one to escape . Hoffman here . Remove the guard from the front . One of the Americans will be coming out soon . Allow him to leave , but put a man on him . You . Come with me . Move ! You will change into the hospital gown now . Get the guard out of the way , but dont alert him . The prisoner must be convinced hes effecting his own escape . Now watch him . Freedom is on his mind . But he must have a weapon . He must arm himself . Yes , a small arm . Very good . Very good . Now he will check to see if he has raised an alarm . No guards . He could escape now , but he wont . Not yet . Not with his friend in jeopardy . He doesnt have much time now . Whoevers on the phone will certainly spread the alarm . But he has to try . Unless you want him breaking in here , youd better sound the alarm now . If he stays , he will certainly be apprehended . If he cannot help his friend - Yes , thats it . Go for help . Ja . Very , very good indeed . His emotions are quite predictable . - Where are those photographs ? - Here they are , General . - Thank you . - I checked out the Nazi doctor . His name is Dr. Hans Kleinemann . It was rumored that he developed a quick form of brainwashing through the use of drugs . Unfortunately , most of the people he experimented with died . This must be it . Sainte-Mére-Église . Sit down . What are they doing to him ? - Who are they ? - I dont know . Ray , can you locate that building in this photograph ? No . And we dont have the comparative locations for the gestapo headquarters either . Ann , get on the computer again . See if you can find out what building the gestapo used in the town of Sainte-Mére-Ëglise . Yes , sir . General , even if we do get the locations ... how are you gonna decide which one to transfer ? I dont know . I honestly dontt know . All right . Who are you ? My name is Anthony Newman . Im an American . Or a German with a good command of English . Im not a German . Theyre holding my friend down at gestapo headquarters . - He needs help . Theyll probably torture him . - Why should we help him ? - Youre members of the underground , arentt you ? - What makes you think that ? The gestapo thinks were part of your group . And , uh , you escaped from gestapo headquarters ? Yes , thats right . Or they permitted you to escape in the hope of trapping us . We keep a close watch on gestapo headquarters . No one gets away from there unless the gestapo want them to . Chien . Hitler . There was an S.S. man trailing him . Unknown to you , of course . I didnt know I was being trailed . I just was hoping that the underground would find me and help me get my friend out . Like you helped us at the prison tonight ? No , uh , he could not have known we would be there . Somebody did . Somebody told them . I say that Nazis have sent him here to spy on us . We should kill him . Tonight ! It is time for the BBC . Mirabeau , watch him . Good evening . This is the BBC News . Severe storms continue to plague most of the British Isles today . A low-pressure center has moved off the Isle of Man ... sending heavy rain showers into the area between London and Edinburgh . There will be no personal messages till our second broadcast . - Listen to me . My friend - - Now , listen ! You heard Duchamps . If your friend is in gestapo headquarters ... nothing can help him . Nothing at all . What I am going to give you now ... will make you feel very pleasant . You will not fall asleep . Instead you will have the desire to talk ... to answer my questions . You will regard me as your friend . - Your only friend . - I will tell you nothing . How long will it take for this serum of yours to work ? How soon can he answer questions ? We cannot trust any answers he will give . Well , then , what is the point of all this ? To reach his subconscious ... open his mind and erase his past . Can you hear me ? Do you know that I am talking to you ? Yes . You will pay special attention to my voice . Mine will be the only questions you will answer ... until I tell you otherwise . Do you understand ? I understand . - What is your name ? - Douglas Phillips . - Your nationality ? - American . Ask him about the Allied invasion plans . Now I want you to tell me what you know ... about the Allied invasion plans . Come on . Come on , Douglas . You can tell me . That is something you know . D - day , june 6 . Germany defeated . - 1945 . - Gibberish . No , not gibberish . Pieces of the story ... he has been conditioned to repeat and repeat . If you can get anything out of him regarding the underground ... let me know , Doctor . Until then , I have more to do than waste my time ... with your psychiatric gymnastics . You will open your eyes now . You will be able to see me very well . Open your eyes . You can see me very well , cant you ? Yes . You will look to your right now . Do you recognize the picture ? - It is myself . - And who are you ? - What is your name ? - Douglas Phillips . No . Douglas Phillips is dead . Your name is Heinrich Kreuger . - Whats your name ? - Imm Douglas Phillips . No . Douglas Phillips is dead . Your name is Heinrich Kreuger . - What is your name ? - My name is Heinrich - No . Phillips . My name is Douglas Phillips . Youre doing very well , Herr Kreuger . Very well indeed . Another two or three hours ... and you will know exactly who you are ... and the man you were will be quite dead . And that concludes the news . Kindly listen now to a few personal messages . - Get ready . - The fox is on the loose . The maple trees are green . Mary has a brother named Christopher . The long sobs of the violins of autumn . Thats it . The road makes an S curve . The dog has blue eyes . That concludes the messages for this afternoon . What do you know about it ? There was a message to be sent over the BBC . There was a second line which was supposed to be the signal for the invasion . - Was ? - Is . And what is this line ? I dont know . If youre an American , how did you get here ? We were being transported back to our home base ... and they - they put us here by mistake . Look . If the Germans meant to use me to infiltrate the underground ... they never would have dragged me to gestapo headquarters first . Theyre far too clever for that ! That is true . Can you identify yourself ? Do you have any papers ? He has nothing . I searched him . And you claim you were sent here to help us , huh ? Look , I told you . We were put here by mistake . How can you prove who you are ? I cant . Not any more than you can prove that youre not a unit of the gestapo ... pretending to be the underground . Touché . Listen . What is your specialty ? Demolition ? - Electronics . - Electronics ? If hes telling the truth , we can use him . If he is not , he can destroy us all . I say we take a chance . Get out the refinery maps . I believe your story . We can use you if you are willing to join us . Ill do anything I can . But first I want to get my friend out of gestapo headquarters . Well try ... when we get the invasion signal . When the signal comes , our mission ... is to cut the telephone cables beneath gestapo headquarters . Until then , we keep away from there . All of us . We will give the German no rest . First it was a prison . Now we hit the Cherbourg refineries . It is essential to the invasion that the German fuel supply be wiped out . That is impossible . That refinery is so well guarded . - We could never get inside . - We dont have to . Here . Open the map . Here is the refinery . And here a gas tank near the street . If we blow this , it will get the refinery . Pow ! We will leave here at 2000 hours . Mirabeau , you will drive the truck . - What is your name again ? - Newman . Newman , you will take care of the wiring . Verlaine , you and I will cover him . I will go over the wiring diagrams with you later . One last thing . So there will be no possibility of a leak of information ... we will all stay here in this room until it is time to go . I have the location of the gestapo headquarters , General . Thank you . The gestapo used a doctors office at 74 Rue de la Mer . Oh , yes . Here it is . Itll take me a while to work out the coordinates . Lock in on Dougs signal first . Your name is Kreuger ... and this is the village in which you were born . Your life as a child was not pleasant . His new childhood is fed into his brain . Visual memories . So you turn him into somebody else ? What good is he to us ? Wait . Heres something interesting . And the man responsible ... for the death of your father last year is still alive . Look at his face . Remember the face . Should you see this man , you must kill him . He is evil . Deceptively so . If he speaks to you , you will not hear him . You must kill him . Psychiatric parlor tricks , Doctor . I am plagued by the underground ... and you occupy yourself with mental games . We will see , Major . I have a consignment here to deliver . I am one hour late . Here are my orders . Who were you trying to kill ? The German or me ? Come . The truck is waiting . Yes , General . My men are doing everything they can to locate the men who did it . General , I am paying an informant , but he did not tell me about this raid . I have the coordinates , General . I want a visual fix . Then well take him at my signal . Yes , sir . Major , come here . I want to show you something . Look , the world is falling in around my neck , and you - This is important . Kleinemann did what he said he would do . Hold the retrieve . Captain , this is your commanding officer ... Major Hoffman . Heil Hitler . ! - What is your name , Captain ? - Heinrich Kreuger . - And your unit ? - 74th Panzer Division . Gestapo . Hoffman . Why did you not tell me about the raid on the refinery ? I see . Of course I will pay it . Just give me the address . Yes , I have it . That was one of my informers . You will take some men to this address . If possible , you will take the saboteurs alive . If not , you will kill them . Do you understand the order ? Completely . My car and the men are outside . Well , what do you think ? I think hes completely brainwashed . He could be faking . Go around and cover the front of the building . You , come with me . We may have trouble with the telephone cables . Theres only a single stairway leading to the basement . Gestapo ! Lets get out ! Doug ! Whats wrong with you ? Whats the matter ? You cant shoot a man in the face , can you ? No , you can only shoot him in the back , as you did my father ! What ? Doug , dont ! Dontt ! - Dont make me do it ! - Get out of the way ! Dont shoot ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! - Chien . - Hitler . The German capitaine went back to headquarters . They will be searching this district from house to house before long . That will suit you fine , wont it ? They sent you here to spy on us , didnt they ? Why didnt you shoot him when you had the chance ? No , because that would have spoiled it , wouldnt it ? - Doug is only pretending to be one of them . - Ah , pretending ! Youre in no position to make accusations . You tried to kill me after the raid . - Shut up , both of you ! - You side with him against me ! - I said shut up ! - And that concludes the news . Kindly listen to a few personal messages . The fox is angry . The spring in Mexico is very warm . The dice are on the table . - Thats us . - Quiet ! The long sobs of the violins of autumn ... wound my heart with a monotonous languor . That is the signal . The day has finally come . We will cut the telephone cables tonight . We will paralyze communications on the Cherbourg Peninsula . We will have a better chance of success if we kill him first . No . I say it was coincidence that the Nazis arrived at the prison ... and it was fate that they attacked our other headquarters . Do you really believe in that , Duchamps ? Unless I believe in that , we are doomed before we start . It will take all of us to do thejob . And if we cannot trust each other , the job is impossible . You will come with me to steal the staff car . Verlaine , you will set the explosives . Mirabeau , scout gestapo headquarters . And now , I suggest we get some rest . Major , I want 20 men . Enough to canvass that entire district house by house . We will root them out and destroy the pigs one by one . I admire your zeal , Captain , but - It is the only way it can be done . And we would do it , if we had the men available . But , unfortunately , we have had to send most of our staff to Rennes for field maneuvers . Hoffman . Send him in . Our informant is here . Uh , you are among friends , Mirabeau . He is one of us . Now what do you have for me ? Something very important . But I want £ 5,000 for it , English money . I have news of the invasion . I will decide how much it is worth after I hear it . We received a signal from the BBC this afternoon . The invasion will take place in 48 hours . - In what area ? - Between here and Merville . Oh , nonsense . We have heard that broadcast . The British and the Americans are creatures of habit . They will never launch an invasion , unless on the very best weather conditions . And the Channel forecast is bad . They are sending out false reports . I am not interested in invasion rumors . So I will pay nothing for them . What else do you have ? I can deliver the leaders of the underground to you tonight . The price will be £ 1,000 sterling , 500 in advance . - How will you deliver them ? - We have orders to blow the telephone cable ... right underneath gestapo headquarters . In about 30 minutes , a command car will be stolen from the Rue de la Mer . The men will come here as an inspection team . And under this pretext , they will go to the basement ... place the explosives and then leave . And , uh , just what is your part in all of this ? I - I have the tools to put your alarm out of commission . Also , I will be the lookout . All right . We shall be ready for them . Where will the American be in the next hour ? He - He will be helping to steal the car . - I have to - I have to go . - No , no ! Wait ! - How many men will be after the car ? - Two . The American and Duchamps . We will rendezvous after they have it . - All right . You go now . - Thank you . Thank you . I will arrange a reception party for them . No , wait . This will be your job , Captain Kreuger . Its your enemy . The one who poses as an American . He will be there . You will take care of him . Yes . This time I will not miss . This time I will kill him . They keep that car available for couriers in the field class . If the guard does not accept my orders , I will have to kill him . - You cover me . Understood ? - Yes . I am Captain Haus . My orders are to proceed to Rennes immediately . Doug ! - Leave him ! Get in the car ! - No , we have to take him ! Help me ! Help me . ! I say we kill him now . You should not have brought him here in the first place ! He means nothing but trouble . It has to be done . - You , get away from him . - Put that away , Mirabeau . I am not going to risk my life on your Nazi friend . Tais toi , both of you ! And put the gun down ! Youre not killing anyone . Welll wait until the doctor gets here . - Chien . - Hitler . I appreciate your coming , Dr. Shumate . It is no small risk . If there were another doctor in the village , I would be fighting by your side . This is the man , Doctor . A very interesting case . Verlaine told me about him . Uh , uh , uh . Can you hear me ? Leave me alone . Doug ? Doug , its me-Tony . My name is Heinrich Kreuger . You . You tell them who I am . You saw me at gestapo headquarters . - Go on . Tell them . - Whats he talking about ? Wh-Why does he pretend to recognize me ? So ... thats why you wanted to kill him . You dont believe these Americans , do you ? Its a conspiracy . You can see that , cantt you ? Cant you ? Drop it ! Drop it ! Get over there ! Well cut the pretense , eh ? Get back there ! Stay there ! I will get paid ... whether I deliver you or they collect you here . It is easy to make mistakes in this business , mon ami . I wish to apologize . Im sure I would have thought the same thing in your place . We will stop you . You will not succeed . - I have given him a sedative . - Can you help him ? Perhaps one of the psychiatrists in Paris can help him . I am only a country physician . No . It is my opinion only Kleinemann can give him back his identity . He has given him a serum . Only Kleinemann will have the antidote . - But I will stay with him . - Then we have to get Kleinemann out and bring him here . The project comes first . If we can get Kleinemann and still obtain our objective , we will do it . But remember , the lives of a great many men depend on how effective we are . The direct assault is out . We must change our plans . Along which wall of the gestapo basement are the telephone cables ? The west wall . Trés bien . We will avoid gestapo headquarters altogether . You will cut the cables and electric wires behind gestapo headquarters . If they are expecting us , this will confirm their suspicions . We will go into the basement . When you have finished , join us there . It is now ... 10 : 46 . - What about getting Kleinemann ? - If we are lucky ... you can make your try after we have set the bomb . Okay . The basement we want is this side of gestapo headquarters . When the guard starts the other way , we go . - When you have cut the wires , meet us in the basement . - Okay . Now . Where are they ? Perhaps Mirabeau was lying . No . Relax , Major . A man like Mirabeau doesnt lie ... when theres a large amount of money at stake . - You see ? - Get ready . The wires are cut . Four meters . The main cable should be right behind this wall . Are you sure you have enough explosives ? When this goes off , there will be nothing left of the gestapo except a charred building . - How much time can you give me to get Kleinemann ? - Three minutes . - Three minutes ? - You cover the bomb . I will go and help him . What does Kleinemann look like ? Oh , about 60 years old , craggy face , mustache - - Youll never get him out ! - Look , make some noise . That should draw some of them downstairs . Very well . But three minutes . Now get going ! They are tunneling through the basement walls . You two get downstairs . Go next door . Cut them off . Hold it . ! This building is gonna blow up in one minute , Dr. Kleinemann . You have 30 seconds to get the antidote to the serum you used on the American . - Yes , but I - - Get it ! Im a scientist . Dontt expect any false heroic gestures from me . If there is nothing more I can do , I will go now . I will have many patients today . Le bon Dieu bless you , Doctor . Thank you . You know my voice . You will do what I tell you to do . You will listen . Your name is Douglas Phillips . You will resume your real identity . What has happened to you will seem like a dream . Its not working , Kleinemann ! The antidote is in his bloodstream . It takes time . On the count of three , you will awaken . You will feel fresh , alert , relaxed ... better than you ever felt in your life . One , two , three ! Tony ! - Whats going on here ? - Thatss gonna take some explaining . - It is the beginning . - The invasion . Its morning , June the sixth . I should leave you here to the mercy of the bombers . But you have information we need , and you will give it to us . We must all get to the shelter . A terrible necessity , Ray . I want to try for a transfer as soon as possible . Tracking and ready , sir . Hold it until I give the word ... and pray that it works . - Wed better get to shelter . - Right . This , then , Your Majesty , is the great Magna Carta ... limiting the powers of the king and establishing the rights of man . It needs only your signature to make it the law of the land . You , the Earl of Huntington ! You call yourself a loyal subject ? This is treason ! Treason ! Ill hang you and all the barons who follow your flag . ! Seize the traitor ! Seize him ! Dont let him escape ! Surrender . ! Surrender now . ! Chain him to the wall . Go tell the captain of the guards to search the castle . More of Huntingtons men may have got in . Im sorry you became involved in my quarrel with the king . But well die for a good cause . - Just who are you ? - That doesnt matter . But as for the Magna Carta , King john will sign it . - Im sure of it . - Itss a pity wellll never live to see it . Heat the other iron . Where is the Council of Barons meeting ?

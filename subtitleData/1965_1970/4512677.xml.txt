 DESTROY ALL MONSTERS ( KAIJU SOUSHINGEKl ) The year is 1999 . The U.N.S.C. Has established an exploratory base on the surface of the moon . At the Rocket Departure Center on earth lunar-bound spacecraft are launched on a daily basis . Moonlight SY-3 ... Standby for takeoff ! 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 0 ... ! An underwater research center was set up at Ogasawara Island , allowing scientists to study marine life in its natural surroundings . Many new forms of fish are being artificially evolved here . While on the island , all of the world 's monsters have been collected and confined , hence the name , Monsterland . Among them are , Godzilla ... Rodan ... As well as , Angilas Mothra and Gorosaurus , are the island 's main inhabitants . In the past , all of these monsters brought terrible destruction upon humanity . Special electronic devices guard each of the monsters according to its own characteristics . Rodan can fly within a limited boundary between land and water before being stopped by the invisible magnetic force screens that surround the island . Food is always available here and the monsters are free to eat as much as they can catch . The entire island is automatically controlled with a command center located deep beneath the earth . Also , check CHX . Hey , we finally made it . How are you ? I hope you find our monsters to your liking . Yes , very much ! Well , you can relax here . You 'll be my research assistant . Okay ! Our mission on this island is to make a complete study of the monsters living here . Right ! Kyoko Manabe , you have a phone call . Please report to the nearest station . Hello ! Katsuo ! Where are you ? I 'm at the lunar control station . Oh , my ! I just landed a little while ago . Really ? I was worried about you being on Monsterland . Well , look at you ! I told you I would be alright ! Yeah , I know I shouldn 't worry about you . I 'm more concerned about Godzilla and the others ! Well ! The truth is , I like the monsters we have there ! Really ? Just kidding ... But you never know out there . Can you tell Dr. Yoshida that we 've spoken ? The doctor is attending a meeting in Tokyo . Well , can you let him ... Hello ... ? Hello ... ? What 's wrong ? Hello ! Hello ! All stations , all stations , respond ! All stations , what 's going on ? ! What 's the matter ? We 've lost all power ! What ? Is it affecting all of our backups as well ? It 's mind-boggling ! Alright , let 's find the source of this alarm ! How is the alarm system working ? ! It 's out ! What 's this ? I don 't understand . Professor ! It 's gas ! All communications were cut off from Monsterland . In Tokyo , the United Nations Scientific Committee is meeting with Dr. Yoshida . An emergency session was convened to restore all communications with the island . Doctor , we 're receiving Ogasawara Island on monitor six . Good ... Switch to the main screen . Yes , sir ! It 's no good ! We 've lost the signal again ! Try it once more . No , keep trying it until you get through . Someone could be jamming us on purpose ! Someone could be jamming us ... But who would do something like this ? Doctor , it 's back ! This is Monsterland ? It has changed ... Could it be a new volcanic eruption ? No , enlarge the picture a little more . Yes , sir . What 's happening ? - What ? ! Such terrible destruction ! I will try to arrange for my country 's help . This is a broadcast from Moscow ! We have an emergency ... ! I repeat , we have an emergency ! Rodan is approaching the border of Moscow ! Rodan ? It 's on course to destroy the city of Moscow ! Russian leaders have summoned their defense forces ! There 's no doubt that this is the same Rodan from Monsterland , at Ogasawara Island . Rodan in Moscow ? What 's it doing there ? This is Paris ! This is Paris reporting ! A subterranean monster has broken thorough the streets of the city ! Paris 's most famous landmark , the Arc de Triumph is directly in its path ! Ah ! It 's destroying it ! It 's destroying the Arc ! There is no doubt that this monster will destroy Paris just as easily ! Monsters are attacking major cities all over the world . Rodan is in Moscow , Mothra in Peking ... Manda is in London , and Baragon is in Paris . This news just in ... Godzilla is attacking New York . I repeat , Godzilla is attacking New York . Doctor , what has the committee come up with ? How did the monsters escape ? Do you think it 's sabotage ? None of us are in a position to supply those answers . At this time , it 's impossible to tell what 's behind all of this . What do you think , Dr. Yoshida ? All I can tell you is , 20 years ago we started confining monsters to the island . After we had captured all of the monsters , we sealed it off 10 years ago as a precaution . People , people ! We don 't know what happened . For the moment , you must not create a panic . Your cooperation in this is vital for us . Dr. Yoshida , if our country is so close to the island , why wasn 't Tokyo attacked ? We were wondering about that ourselves . We do not wish to be rude but that 's all we have . Moonlight SY-3 ! Moonlight SY-3 ! This is Moonlight SY-3 . Go ahead ! Turn your ship around . What 's gone wrong ? Return to base , and I 'll tell you then . Hey ! See that ? Yes ! We should try to follow it . But we were ordered back . This is more important . It 's our first contact with a UFO . This could be dangerous , Katsuo . What was that ? Moonlight SY-3 ! Moonlight SY-3 , respond ! Damn , let 's go . But this is the first time they 've ever done that ! We 've only just left the earth . Do they think we can just come back to help them ? They didn 't ask for our help . Then why are we going back ? They only wanted you to come home . I 'm not sure if the automatic landing system is working so use your monitors to land on Monsterland . I 'm not sure what you 'll find there . Your ship is equipped to handle anything you might need to finish your mission . However , you should arm yourselves . What ? Arm ourselves ? Yes . You 'll be on your own there . Roger . We 've got a signal ! Our ship is being guided ! Good ... Roger . We 're landing , secure controls ! Landing engines , okay ! Prepare to land ! This is Moonlight SY-3 . We 've arrived at the control center . Good . The center has been completely cut off . Your job is to see if anything has happened . We can 't make any plans until we know what 's wrong . I understand . Acid and gas gauges are reading normal . Alright , let 's go . Be careful ! - Okay ! Hey ! Look there ! That 's not right ... How could this be happening ? Welcome back ... Kyoko ! Doctor ! It 's been a while . What 's the matter with you ? You didn 't have to come . What is going on here ? Doctor ! Well , well ... You don 't have to shout . No one is in danger . Everything will be alright . What I need from you is your cooperation . Cooperation ? What do you mean by cooperation ? Don 't you know what the monsters are doing out there ? Of course ... We 're using remote control to guide them . Remote control ? See for yourself . This is Mothra in Peking right now ... Here is Godzilla ... And here is Rodan ... In the end , we 'll control them whenever we want . Well , I 'm sure you want to meet the inventor . Come this way . This way ... I 'm sorry to keep you waiting . Everyone , she 's here to answer your questions . We are not here as your enemies . With everyone 's cooperation we can turn the earth into a new and advanced civilization . What if the earth doesn 't want to cooperate ? What will you do to us then ? ! Katsuo ... Why don 't you listen to what she 's saying ? Kyoko ! Your new civilization is already under way . Don 't sacrifice yourselves for what you cannot stop . What ? What country are you from ? Kiraku ... Kiraku ? She 's not from earth . You see , there are several small planets between Jupiter and Mars . Her home is one of them . You believe what she 's telling you ? I 'm ready to accept her story as the truth because of her scientific ability . The monster remote control unit she built , is the perfect example . She 's certainly not from our world . I believe she is from out there . Ogata ! Get away ! Well , are you satisfied ? Her barrier is indestructible . What are you doing ? ! You may have changed , but where are the others ? Everyone is fine . They 'll be coming out shortly . Are you holding them prisoner ? Don 't you understand ? It 's pointless to struggle . Alright , I understand . But you two are going to come back with us . Don 't try it . You 're going with us . Move it ! Hey ! It 's gas ! Hurry ! Halt ! Halt ! Hurry ! Captain ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Captain ! Come on ! Captain ! We have masks ! Kyoko ! Get him out of here ! Kyoko ! Kyoko ! Captain ! Captain ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Captain ! Captain ! Captain ! Alright ! Let 's go ! Were you brainwashed ? Were you brainwashed by them ? We 're wasting our time . He won 't tell us anything . How about this , Wataru ... If you help us out , we 'll do what we can to return you to normal . Do you understand ? In case you didn 't know our world is approaching the brink of destruction ! Our defense forces have found the island to be deserted . Where is their new base of operation ? I beg of you ... If you help us locate their base they 'll go easier on you in the courts . Do you think that alien woman cares about you ? What 's the matter ? Doctor ! Don 't touch him ! You ! You realize you 're being used by the people of Kiraku ? You 'll understand , Dr. Yamada . You 'll see the truth . You 're coming with us ! Are you all heartless now ? ! Be quiet ! To keep you in control , I think we 'll put these on you . The police are coming ! Let 's retreat . Hey ! Fall back ! Stop ! Scalpel . Do you know if he was hard of hearing ? No . Well , it 's not a hearing aid . I don 't understand the technology . It appears to be some kind of new metal . I 'd say it was some kind of internal transmitter and receiver . But how did they get this into his body ? Doctor , could they control the monsters this way ? You mean like a remote control ? Do you think they 're controlling the others this way , too ? Yes ... That 's why he wouldn 't reveal their base . He was under their control ! We don 't know where their base is . If we did , we could jam their transmissions . Let me take my team to search for their base ! That 's an unusual wavelength ... Find out the source of that transmission ! Roger ! I 've traced it to the mountains of Japan ! Look , I don 't know what it is and I don 't have time to get it examined . Did you buy it from someone ? I found it on my land ! Officer ! Officer ! A spaceship is coming this way ! Huh ? - Over there ! Where is it ? There it is ! Huh ? What is it ? R ... Rodan ! That 's not it ! Give me ! There it is ! That 's Moonlight SY-3 ! My son works on the lunar colony . So that 's it ? I hope he 's doing well ! What 's going on ? Oh , we 're tracing an unusual transmission . Excuse me , officer . - Sure ! What 's that ? Is that a radar ? It has been discovered by the U.N.S.C. That these objects are in fact relay stations used for the remote control . The enemy used this method on the monsters to throw the entire world into a panic . Others were found in Dover ... In church steeples in Spain ... One was discovered in the Alps , under sheets of ice . In Guam , one was found in a coconut tree . Now , we will ask Dr. Yoshida to explain how it works . This device can send and receive signals at great distances . We 've estimated that the strength of this broadcast can reach about 2000 kilometers . Therefore , in order to control the monsters a number of these devices had to be set up all over the world . Now , the Kiraku have started their plans by taking over Monsterland and I 'm afraid they also control the scientists . Their actions may result in our destruction , so please be careful if you see them . The Monsterland scientists are , Minoru Kudo , age 35 ... Tetsuo Ise , age 30 ... Shin Kuroi , age 28 ... And Kyoko Manabe , age 23 ... Those were the Japanese scientists . There is also Michael Dawson , age 32 ... And Elmer Hughes , age 29 ... You 're okay , thank you . Just a moment , we need to examine your neck . Sorry to disturb you . You 're fine , thank you . Excuse me . You 're fine , thank you . Rodan is flying over districts 7 and 8 . All residents must take shelter immediately . Finally , one of them is here . - Yes . In which district would it be best to attack ? The Jincho district ... There is another incident ! Godzilla has emerged in the first district ! What ? Manda ! - Manda is here ! Prepare to attack ! Prepare to attack ! Alright ! Launch the attack ! It wouldn 't have surprised me if Tokyo was attacked by only one monster but Rodan , Godzilla and Manda all at once ? You 're right ... They were in New York , London and Moscow . What brought the monsters here ? Emergency bulletin ! Emergency bulletin ! The giant caterpillar Mothra has arrived ! Hello . The destruction is horrible . I saw what they did to Tokyo . There were four monsters . We think they left the Tokyo area and are headed for the Izu Springs . Izu ? The Izu hot springs have all dried up . The same thing happened at Monsterland . Do you think there 's a connection ? Baragon is presently in this area . Baragon ? First , cities around the world were destroyed while Tokyo was left untouched . That was to draw our attention away from Japan so they could build their base . I see ... In order to destroy it , we 'll have to find it . Yes ... You are to travel to Izu in your spaceship and go underground at this point here . If you find their base , destroy it , before they have a chance to destroy us . Ah , Commander ... How are you doing ? I 'm fine . Commander ... It can 't be ... Kyoko ! You ! Where can we speak in private ? No , I 've come to speak to everyone here . You 're wasting your time ! We won 't let them take over our minds ! You don 't have to stay if you don 't want to listen . I 'm here to answer everyone 's questions . Where is your base located ? Our stronghold is in Izu . What are they planning in Izu ? The Kiraku are going to take over the earth . Do the Kiraku want to control us like you ? Yes ... Once you accept the Kiraku 's offer , and everyone is placed under their control they will take control of all the monsters and return them to Ogasawara Island . So the Kiraku will let the monsters continue to run rampant until then ? ! What offer is that ? It 's blackmail ! I came to speak to everyone . You should just be quiet . You ! What are you doing ? ! Don 't try to struggle ! I 'm saving you from their control ! Don 't struggle ! Doctor ! This is how they controlled her . This is how they controlled Dr. Otani and all of the people and monsters at Monsterland ! Doctor ! These are new devices . They should be analyzed . Kyoko ! Kyoko ! Hang in there ! Kyoko ! You 're not seeing things clearly , it 's me ! You 're free from their control now ! It 's okay , it 's okay ! Miss Manabe , tell us ... Do you know the location of he Kiraku 's secret base ? The Kiraku ? Yes ... Where is the Kiraku base in Izu ? I ... I ... I don 't know where ! It 's probably an effect of the mind control . Well then ... Prepare to invade the forest ! The 14th division is ready ! Alright ... Prepare to fire . Preparing to fire ! Here we go everyone ! Yes , sir ! SY-3 is starting to land ! Alright ! We have confirmation of Godzilla ! Keep going ! Emergency power ! Emergency power ! Alright ! Open fire ! Open fire ! Hey , what 's wrong ? We don 't have any traction ! Angilas ! It 's Angilas ! What ... ? Damn ... All forces , retreat ! All forces , retreat ! Damn ! Hey , let 's go home . This stinks ... We 're not done yet . Hey ! Should we follow it ? Alright ! It 's heading for Mount Fuji ! It must have something to do with the Kiraku base . Perform a scan of the entire area ! Yes , sir ! Enemy target moving in , it 's Rodan ! Captain , if we can 't outrun it , should we fight ? We can 't beat it like this . Let 's see if it can keep up with us . Prepare the main engines ! Main engines , on ! Increase auxiliary rockets ! Well , well ... Rodan couldn 't keep up with us . We would have found their base if it didn 't interrupt us ! Yes , but we now have an idea of its location . We 'll search the entire range of Mt . Fuji , until we find their hidden base ! Forward ! All units , forward ! All units , forward ! Godzilla ! Scatter ! Get back ! This way ! Hey , what 's wrong ? Hang in there ! Are you okay ? I 'm okay . Let 's go . Is it a cave ? Yes , I think so . Damn ! I can 't open it . The Kiraku are probably waiting for us but that 's the only way to go . Alright ... Alright , let 's blast it ! - Don 't ! It 's useless . Welcome ... We meet again , Captain . This is good ... You have brought Major Tada of your army with you . Huh ? Today , we will show you how inferior your forces are against us . Inferior ? So , this is it ! We did it ! There they are ! Yes . Now you know that the saucer you were following was one of our spaceships . Do you finally accept that we are from outer space ? Well then , is there something important you wish to tell us ? A proclamation ... Proclamation ? ! Major Tada , please hear this . The earth does not belong to you humans . With Mount Fuji as our stronghold we Kiraku are vowing to make this world ours . Anyone who opposes our invasion will die . Do you understand ? What ? ! Damn ! Be careful ! Right . A new control center has been established on Ogasawara Island . Scientists trying to break the remote control 's key system and use it to stop the monsters . That did it ! The remote control is on the moon ! Hope ... There is finally hope ! Control to SY-3 ! You are not to rest until your mission is completed . I understand . Check the map again . Right ! Pay attention ... Take heading 41.4 degrees south until you reach the Caseanic crater . They 'll probably be using radar , so maintain a low altitude . Okay , we 're leaving . Attention crew , we will fly low for 40 kilometers ... We will then turn , southwest and travel along the 300 kilometer ridge . We will turn north for a brief period and arrive at the Caseanic Crater . Roger ! Target bearing 40 degrees . It seems to be a saucer . We found it ! We haven 't found anything but a saucer . What should we do ? Has it seen us yet ? Either way , weren 't we ordered to stay until our mission was completed ? Alright , genius ! We 're going in whether they saw us or not ! Final destination is just ahead ! Stop ! Stop ! Prepare to land ! Alright , let 's go ! Land ! Landing ! Stop ! - Stop ! Ground car , ready ! Ground car , ready ! Cut off the fuel ! The fuel is off ! Coolers , on ! Coolers , on ! There 's no reaction ! Hurry ! The temperature gauge is reaching critical ! Critical ? ! Yes ! Captain ! It 's no good ! It 's so hot , the tanks are bound to explode ! We 'd better take off ! It 's too late now ... Ground car , let 's go ! Yes , sir ! Stop ! Stopping ! Ready the lasers ! Lasers ready to fire ! Fire ! Commander ! The SY-3 assault team has engaged the enemy . Really ? Contact the lunar colony and get me a report . We don 't have anything to report yet ! As soon as we hear something , we 'll call you . Yes ? Lunar colony , go ahead . Hang it up ! I 'm worried , we haven 't heard from them yet . For all we know , their ship could have gone up in flames ! We may as well put the colony on alert . Yes , sir . Let 's go . - Yes , sir ! Okada , Deshika , Arima , come with me . - Yes , sir ! The rest of you stay here . - Yes , sir ! Look ! Incredible ! Alright ... Arima , Deshika , check out that section . Make sure the equipment is destroyed ! Yes , sir ! It 's amazing that we did so much damage to it . They made it look strong , but it had weaknesses . Look ! Over there ! They 're the Kiraku ... Huh ? I guess they can only exist in warm climates . When we broke through the barrier , they must have returned to their true form . Are they dead ? No ... I 'm sure of it . Captain ! Captain ! Stay here ! - Yes , sir ! We thought this might be important . It 's still working ... Alright , remove it . We 'll take it back to earth . Yes , sir ! Come in ! Come in ! Anything ? All lines are out . No word yet , or any signal either . Then did they fail ? Well , did they fail ? No good ! Alright , if we can 't cut it off , we 'll burn through it ! What 's the matter ? We 'll need one of the lasers . Right ! Run the line ! Okay . Let 's open it . - Right ! Screwdriver ! Okay ! Let 's go ! Hurry ! It 's been too long since we 've seen or heard from them . It looks as though they 've failed in their mission . Okay , turn on the power ! What 's wrong ? It 's no good ! The cable can 't take it ! I don 't care ! Switch the power back on ! But the cable can 't take it ! We 're not returning without this ! Switch it on ! Right ! They did it ! They 've shut down the system ! Alright , let 's hurry ! We might be able to control the monsters ! Yes , sir ! Hurry ! Let 's get this thing back to earth ! Doctor , are they still alive ? Yes , they 're still alive but it would take several thousand degrees to revive them . They 're living metal , right ? Yes . I see ... That 's why they set up their base near a volcano . It 's clear that the Kiraku are ahead of us in certain areas of science . It must have taken them thousands of years . Thousands of years ? ! Don 't they die ? No , the cold only interrupts their life . Eternal life is one of the areas they 've perfected . Eternal life ? Yes . I see ... So , if the Kiraku can only live in high temperatures ... We can then use the cold to defeat them . It 's the only chance we have . Major , get to work . Yes . It 's Godzilla ! Oh , no ! Hello ! - Doctor ! You did it ! - Yes ! We owe you a great deal ! Doctor ! Don 't celebrate ! Godzilla has just appeared ! What ? ! Is this true ? Yes ! Godzilla is in Tokyo ? - Yes ! Well , well ... Don 't let it bother you . Godzilla is under our control now . Huh ? It strayed into Japan . Then , doctor ... ! The monsters are under our control now ! It 's mankind 's turn this time ! At last we can challenge the Kiraku with the same weapons they used against us ! The beautiful weather at Mt . Fuji is in stark contrast to the tension in the air over the upcoming battle . The silent forest seems to be waiting for the monster 's charge on the Kiraku 's hidden base . The defense force is stationed around the area . No monsters are in sight yet . The monsters will be led by Godzilla , Rodan and Angilas , but I don 't see them yet . I don 't ... Ah , I see one ! Could it be one of the leaders of the group , like Godzilla ? No , it 's Minya ... ! Minya is the first to arrive ! However , following behind it is the monster , Godzilla ! Now , I see Mothra ! Godzilla is leading the pack , with Mothra close behind ! Next is Angilas ... ! Angilas is leading a pack of monsters to my left . More are coming out ! Angilas is leading Manda , Baragon and Gorosaurus . Kumonga has appeared ! It looks like all of the monsters controlled by the Kiraku have been brought here . I can see Rodan ... ! It 's flying from the south and is circling around both groups of monsters . It is landing behind Godzilla and Mothra . It appears that Godzilla 's group will lead the attack . Godzilla itself will lead them . There 's been no reaction from the Kiraku , as to what is transpiring before them so far . As Godzilla prepares the other monsters to attack , there seems to be little doubt as to who will win . There 's something strange happening above them ! What ? King Ghidorah ! That 's not an earth monster . They brought it ! The controls aren 't set for it . What should we do ? Set the controls for Godzilla and the others to attack it ! King Ghidorah is a space monster . Your controls on earth will not affect it . I have other business , but feel free to surrender at anytime . Damn ! King Ghidorah ! It 's the space monster , King Ghidorah ! It is preparing to fight the earth monsters ! Are Godzilla and the others a match for it ? King Ghidorah is moving in to attack ! The battle is fierce ! Listen as the monsters struggle for victory ! A fire monster has joined in the battle ! Afire monster ? Does such a thing exist ? It must be from space , living in such flames ! It 's coming ! It 's heading straight for us ! Alright , get out ! A signal from the Kiraku ! Dr. Yoshida and his scientists have just met our Fire Dragon . Your best efforts will not be able to destroy it . What do we do ? Should we attack ? Our Fire Dragon will burn Tokyo down in two or three hours . Godzilla ? It 's Godzilla ! It must have found the entrance to the Kiraku base ! The monster will keep going ! It 's attacking the Kiraku base ! It doesn 't need the machine ! Animals know who their natural enemies are . It must consider the Kiraku as one ! We can 't lose ... We can 't lose ! We did it ! Don 't celebrate yet ... We still have to defeat the Fire Dragon . Alright ... ! I 'll take SY-3 to get rid of it ! Katsuo ! Approaching from fifteen degrees , it 's the Fire Dragon ! Good . Ready all available missiles ! Fire ! No good ! There 's no response to the circuit ! They won 't fire ! Okay , one more try . Yes , sir ! Use the rear missiles when it gets behind us . Slow us down ... Right ! Ready ... Fire ! Alright , let 's shake it off ! Look ! It 's going down ! I 've got it ! The Fire Dragon is one of their saucers ! We can try the missiles . Should I fire ? Should I ... ? Alright ... Fire ! We did it ! Well done !

 WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS ( Furankenshutain no kaijû : Sanda tai Gaira ) Captain ! Emergency ! Captain ! Captain ! Hey ! Please , somebody help me ! Oh , nurse ... Visitors aren 't allowed ... I 'm from the Maritime Bureau . He 's not well enough to speak with anyone ! I only need two or three minutes . He hasn 't regained consciousness yet . Frankenstein ... ! The only survivor hasn 't regained consciousness yet . Is he in danger ? The doctor can 't say for certain . It had a crew of five people ... The others must have drowned when the boat sank . Probably ... but it 's strange how a 100 meter long ship could go down so quickly . How is it ? There 's nothing else on board . The only thing we found was this . The ship 's too big for everyone to have been washed off ... You mean the crew ? - Yes . Ordinarily , it 's difficult to lose all hands like that . The water surge couldn 't wash away that many people so thoroughly . It 's notjust a coincidence ? We must learn what became of those four men ... It 's amazing that you were the only one to survive . How many times are you going to say that ? Enough to hear your response ! I want you to tell us what really happened ! Well ? You weren 't malnourished when they found you . We want to know why you weren 't badly injured . Look ... The four other men ... They must have all drowned in the ocean . I called out to them ... before the ship was jostled , and I saw the Frankenstein monster ... . That 's a bunch of nonsense ! That monster hasn 't been found ! Don 't you have another story ? I know what attacked our ship ! I know in my heart that it happened ! At first the crew jumped ship ... After that , the four men ... ! I am not lying . Believe me , I am telling the truth ... Captain , we 've discovered what happened to the four men . You did ? We 're sure this is all from the ship . What could have done this to them ? We 're at a complete loss as to what could have done it . Tokyo telephone ? I need the Kyoto Shinagata Institute , Frankenstein research unit . Hello ? Yes this is it . Just a moment , please . Doctor , it 's a Mr. Yokosuka from the Maritime Bureau . Yokosuka ? Hello , this is Dr. Stewart . What ... ? We haven 't had a Frankenstein here since the one that vanished at Mount Fuji . Yes ... No one has ever reported Frankenstein living in the sea . Alright . What did he say ? He said that a Frankenstein monster may have eaten some humans . Oh , my ... ! Doctor , these are members of the press . They want to ask you questions about the gargantuan , Frankenstein . Have a seat . Doctor , is your Frankenstein alive now ? It is possible . - It is ? ! I haven 't seen my Frankenstein since he escaped . But , even if he did return , he wouldn 't be living in the sea . He wouldn 't be doing things like tipping over boats , or eating humans . Then you don 't believe your Frankenstein is connected to the monster incident ? Yes , that 's my opinion . Even if he were , I 'm sure he wouldn 't be doing anything like eating human beings ! You were with the doctor at that time as well , weren 't you ? Its behavior was always the best around me . It wasn 't easy to see that he was very gentle . No you don 't ! Don 't do that ! Don 't do that ! Let 's leave that closed , okay ? Now , this is what we have next . Don 't ! Not yet . Now , go ahead . Just before he escaped , he found his way into my apartment . In all the time that we had him here , he seemed more gentle than most humans . You know , maybe you should check that fisherman 's story again . That 's all for now , gentlemen . - Thank you . Hey ! What 's wrong ? ! Heave ! Heave ! Heave ! Heave ! Heave ! Heave ! Heave ! What 's that ? ! They 're chasing any story that relates to Frankenstein ! They seem to be obsessed with it . It 's alright , though not very provable . But doctor , it still relates to Frankenstein . Isn 't it our job to shed light on the validity of these stories ? Dr. Mamiya , haven 't you read our report on the Frankenstein in the ocean ? I have ... We just don 't know how much of this is false . Perhaps they just don 't know where he is currently living . Look at this ... Is this Frankenstein 's footprint ? It is ... He was sighted in Yamata where these footprints were made . You can be sure that he 's there . Doctor , I would like to check it out , if you don 't mind . It looks like it was grabbed by something strong . What did you find ? Do you know what it is ? It seems to be some form of sea life . Isn 't it from the Frankenstein ? No , I can 't say what it is yet . This sample isn 't enough . Hey , wait a minute ... Let me catch my breath . Just how far up did you see those footprints anyway ? Up , over there . That thing made them on the other side of the cliff . Look ! Look ! There they are ... It looks like we 've got a bit of work cut out for us back at the lab . Right . Thank you . I 'm finished . - Sorry to bother you . I 'm afraid that those are from Frankenstein ... I don 't believe those cells could have come from any other life form . That 's what I thought as well ... But ... why is it living beneath the sea ? Flight 17 , proceed 180 ° at 10 knots . It is urgent that everyone evacuates the airport ! A monster is coming ! A monster is coming ! It is urgent that everyone evacuates the airport ! A monster is coming ! A monster is coming ! Emergency , emergency ! A monster is coming ! A monster is coming ! Haneda airport is in a state of emergency ! A monster is coming ! No ! No ! Emergency , emergency ! Haneda airport is in a state of emergency ! Emergency ! Your back ! - Doctor ! What was the thing that attacked Haneda airport ? What was it ? I don 't know ... - Were you there at the time ? We haven 't yet heard any details of what had happened . Didn 't you say that the Frankenstein you had in custody posed no threat to mankind ? What do you plan to do about ... - We 'll look into that later ! Everyone , please ! Please ! I 'm sorry , but we don 't have anything more than you already know . What ? Just answer this for us , please ... Do you believe that the monster may be the Frankenstein that you studied ? Dr. Stewart , what do you think it is ? We 'll find out what it is , when we investigate . We leave for Tokyo immediately . I can 't stand the idea of going to the Frankenstein countermeasures meeting . I 'm not in a hurry to get there either ... But I would like to know what their plans are , though . I can 't believe he did it . Neither can I ... What could make Frankenstein live in the sea ? Maybe he fell in love with a whale or something ... Hey , I just thought of something ... Maybe this Frankenstein isn 't our Gargantua . Nothing ... Not yet , anyway . They 're late ... Doctor , can you answer some questions ? Dr. Mamiya ... Excuse us , please ! - Doctor ! What is the defense plan ? We plan on sending a powerful electrical current through Tokyo Bay . Do you have plans for anything else in the meantime ? No . He already has a weakness ... From living at the bottom of the sea , he can 't stand bright lights . He can 't withstand the light on a clear day . Perhaps if you didn 't say that Frankenstein never lived in the sea we wouldn 't have to go through this much trouble . Dr. Stewart , what do you say ? I think you 're right ... Is that so ... ? Does that mean that you 'd continue your studies of Frankenstein , regardless of what happened ? Yes ... yes , I would . That is the point of our problem ... Even though we are in a bad spot , we must continue our work . That 's enough ! Are you returning to Kyoto ? Do you know what would happen if Frankenstein appeared in a peaceful city like this ? I 'm afraid we can 't leave Tokyo until we come up with some kind of solution to this problem . In the meantime , if there were just some way that we could keep him cornered ... The lights ! Turn on the lights ! Is there a doctor here ! Is there a doctor ? The monster is going away ! - Doctor , doctor ! Get a doctor ! Go get a stretcher ! - Right . The monster seems to be harned by bright lights . Please , open your windows and turn on all lights . Please , make the city as bright as day . The monster seems to be harned by bright lights . To repeat the request , to prevent destruction to the city , you are all asked to turn on your lights . Please turn on every light in the city area . The monster seems to be harned by bright lights . Please open all of your windows and shutters . Doctor , is Frankenstein returning to the mountain ? We 're not sure yet that it 's our Frankenstein . Give me the book ... Thanks ... Let 's go find out ... By order of the government , we are to pursue the monster . Hurry ! Hurry ! Grandmother ! - Kei ! Kyo ! Come with me ! Hurry ! Let 's go , let 's go ! We 've done all that we can ! - Hurry , hurry ! Halt ! Ready the searchlights ! Move ! Ready the searchlights ! Quickly ! Alright ! We 're all set ! Lights ! Here is the latest report from headquarters . Here is the latest report from headquarters . The creature has proceeded from Tokyo to the mountains along the river . Searchlights have been placed in defensive positions along this route . Should we attack ? - Negative . But with all of the villages so close by , shouldn 't we attack while he 's completely surrounded ? Anything more than the lights could be dangerous . For now , we will not proceed any further . This is Unit 3 approaching . We are to assist the commander in his attack on the homicidal monster . Unit ! Take positions ! Command , we are at position 10.95 ° . The creature is approximately 300 meters ... Fall back ! Fall back ! Unit , fire ! - Fire ! Fire ! Look out ! Look out ! All units ! Cease fire ! Cease fire ! I gave no order to attack ! Order all units to stand down for now . I 'll put in the order to stand down . At the moment , the creature is north at position 10.95 ° . Wherever he emerges , we will be able to engage him with siz units . We feel that Frankenstein will pass through this wooded area to reach the mountain . In our next maneuver , we will use high voltage beams against it and attempt to destroy him . They 're really going to kill him ? Is it possible that his cell structures could resist it ? Prepare for arrival ! Alright , let 's go ! - Yes , sir ! - Yes , sir ! Right ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Unit A , ready ! - Unit B , ready ! Unit C , ready ! All units are set ! We 're ready in this sector ! - Right ! Commander , Helicopter Unit One ... You are ordered to lure the monster into the established attack zone . Roger , roger ! The monster has slowed its pace . We 'll attack soon . - Yes , sir ! Calling base ! Calling base ! He 's just ahead of us ! Report from position 45 ... The creature is moving just ahead of that unit . Roger . I think we should let him go a little further . That way he 'll be completely within range . Yes , sir ! First unit is ready ! - Right ! Second unit is ready ! - Right ! Third unit is ready ! - Right ! The creature is coming this way ! Hurry ! Switch the units on ! - Switch the units on ! Hey ! Is it ready yet ? It 's time ! Alright ! - Alright ! Generator one is ready ! - Generator one is ready ! Converter one is ready ! - Converter one is ready ! Generator two is ready ! - Generator two is ready ! Converter two is ready ! - Converter two is ready ! All together ... 1 , 2 , ... Go ! Converter four is ready ! Bring the helicopters into position ! - Yes , sir ! Hurry ! Hurry ! - Hurry ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! We 're all set ! - Right ! We 're all set ! - Right ! Preparations for the Maser attack are complete ! Preparations for the electrical assault are complete ! Fire ! - Fire ! Let 's go ! Success ! Calling base ! Calling base ! Damn ... Alright ! Switch on the electricity ! - Switching on ! Alright ! Hey ! Get down ! Commander ! Calling the Commander ! There is a brown one ! There is a brown one ! There is a brown Frankenstein helping the injured one escape into the mountains ! Doctor ! That one has to be the Frankenstein we know ! Then it seems your hunch was correct . Well , it proves that there are two of them . Now , I have to convince them that one is innocent . This is an update from headquarters ! This is an update from headquarters ! The sea Frankenstein will be referred to as Gaira . The mountain Frankenstein will be referred to as Sanda . That is all ... What do you think happened to Gaira ? Could it have returned to the ocean ? Look at these trees ... It 's incredible ... He knocked them down like they were matchsticks or twigs . They probably are , to him . What 's Sanda got to do with this ? How is he involved ? Maybe , if we don 't ask so many questions and try to find some clues , we 'll know that answer . Doctor ! Mr. Yokosuka ! Good find , Akemi . It 's Sanda 's ! Oh , thank you ! Thank you for coming . Have you found the monsters ? No , not yet . If I may suggest , Major , the clue to their position lies with Gaira , who cannot live long without water . You may want to check the lakes and streams around here . I see ... Thank you very much . Notify headquarters . This is unit five calling ... So ... Shall we continue on our way and see what we can dig up on Gaira ? Let 's go . - Thank you . Doctor ! Gaira ! It looks like his hair and tissue ... The cells are identical . This means that the Frankenstein 's are brothers . Brothers ? Maybe not ... Maybe not ... You know , Sanda stayed at Lake Biwa after his escape from my lab . He could have torn off some flesh on a rock that made its way to the ocean . Once there , on protein-rich plankton , another Frankenstein could have grown ... I 've a strange feeling that they aren 't related as we know it ... father and son , or even brothers ... One could be the offshoot of the other . Doctor , if that is the case , wouldn 't an explosion create even more Frankenstein 's ? This could be a disaster for all mankind ! If what you are saying is true , it changes everything . We 'll do what we can to avoid using them . We can use napalm ! It could burn all of the oxygen out of the air and suffocate the cells ! They don 't seem to be afraid of Gaira . They 're young and they don 't have very much fear . It 's strange ... Whenever there is a strong evil force around , youth seems to blossom . Like when the Nazi 's captured Paris and all of the cafe 's were filled with young people . Aren 't we guilty of doing the same thing ? I don 't feel any guilt . I don 't think that they do either . Besides , I don 't think visitors should be turned away because some fish became scarce in the lake . Let 's go for a walk . That 's a good idea ... Before this mist gets any thicker ... Well , looks like it 's getting a little too misty now . We 'd better go back . Run away ! Run away ! What 's the matter ? - It 's the monster ! Head for the car . Akemi ! Help me ! Akemi ! Listen to me and don 't panic ! Hold on , I 'll be right down ! Doctor ! Doctor ! Akemi ! Akemi ! Hold on ! I 'm almost there ! Are you okay ? You remember who we are ! Wait ! Wait ! Sanda remembered me , General . He saved my life ! Gaira is the one that 's dangerous ! Regardless of what you say , we 're going to electrify the lake and use napalm to burn down the forest . You will kill Sanda as well ? We have our orders to kill them both . Command ! Command ! The monsters are on the move ! They are north at 135.10 ° and appear to be running away ! Notify Dr. Mamiya and the rest immediately ! What happened ? I don 't understand what went wrong ! Orders ! I 've come to a decision as to what will become of the monsters . We will attack with every available weapon at our disposal until they are finished . Just a moment ! What about their cells ? We will deal with that after we have completed the task at hand ! Fall back ! All units , retreat ! Retreat ! At the moment , he 's still moving . The monster no longer seems affected by light , and may be returning home . What about Sanda ? Sanda is innocent , General ... He even broke his leg trying to save her ... To save , not destroy ... It 's Gaira that you want . And there 's no doubt he is on his way back to the ocean by now . I agree with him . There 's no mistaking it . Alright , let 's make sure he doesn 't head home ! Move out ! It 's notjust a theory that Sanda is a harmless creature , it 's a fact ! A plain and simple fact that has already been proven . It 's my opinion that he should be allowed to live , so that science can continue its studies . I oppose the doctor 's opinion . Gaira is a wild beast and Sanda is his brother . I believe that we must destroy them both . If you hit them with your heavy artillery , you will scatter their cells halfway to China . Then you will be faced with a thousand Frankenstein 's . How can you be sure of your theory when it isn 't proven ? That is why I 'm opposed to letting it happen ! Give me one week to try to prove my theory . If we find a way to get rid of them that is safe , it is worth the effort . I hope that we can save Sanda . Are you sure you can control him ? Akemi can handle him ... If we use a planned control for him , I 'm sure that we could convince the Japanese government to lend us the resources to test your theory . Perhaps you will find a way that will help you save Sanda 's life . Doctor , could you do that ? We 've got to find Sanda as soon as possible . They have the same cells , the same genetic structure and the same blood . What could that mean , doctor ? He 's somewhere in this area . We 'll start from here ... . Gaira ! That 's just what we needed . Doctor , you 're turning off the lights ? I 'd better call Dr. Mamiya . Hello ? Hello ? This is Dr. Stewart . Get me the defense agency . Yes , and hurry ! Yes . I understand . General , Dr. Stewart and I believe that the lights are no longer effective against him . He now knows that where there 's light , he 'll find food . Turn off your lights ! Turn off your lights ! What was that again ? - Please ! Turn off your lights ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Hurry to the shelters ! Hurry ! - Turn off your car , please ! What 's going on here ? - Hurry to the shelters , right away ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Hey ! Turn off your headlights ! You 'll have to leave your car here ! - Damn ! I 'm not leaving my car here ! Is your car more important than your life ? ! Help me out ! - Hurry ! If the city is blacked out , we could lure him to the sea with lights on the beach . With millions of people trying to evacuate , that could be a great risk . What ? Sanda is moving ? ! Where is he now ? - Where is he now ? He destroyed Kurihashi Bridge ? What else ? Is this the monster you planned to save ? Hello ? Sanda 's in Tokyo ? No ! I 'm positive he hasn 't come to help Gaira ! Doctor . Hello ? This is Dr. Stewart . There 's nothing we can do . Sanda is entering Tokyo . I understand ... I 'll be down there right away . Akemi . Where are you going ? We have to convince him to turn back . You can 't . It 's too late now . No . This time I 'm going to save his life . Akemi ! Akemi ! Halt ! Go to the shelters ! Go on ! Akemi ! You silly nut ! Don 't you know that running ... Come on now ... Does Sanda really mean that much to you ? Yes . Okay , okay . I 'll help your find him then . Butjust remember , he isn 't a toy poodle . We 're all set to open fire ! The streets must be cleared at once ! For your own safety , please evacuate at once ! We 're all set to open fire ! The streets must be cleared at once ! For your own safety , please evacuate at once ! Doctor ! That 's Gaira . Let 's get out of here ! You 're ordered to clear the streets immediately ! You 're ordered to clear the streets immediately ! This way . Sanda ! - Akemi ! Akemi ! Akemi ! Attacking in five minutes ! - What happened ? Head for the secondary command ! All men to the main platform ! Come with me ! - Yes , sir ! Akemi ... Akemi ... Doctor ... Are you alright ? - Yes . That 's good . For a while there , I was beginning to think I lost an assistant . By the way , Sanda came to your rescue again . I think he has a crush on you . General , can 't you spare him just one hour ? Thirty minutes , then ... I 'm sure that he came here to stop Gaira ! But how do you know he will destroy Gaira ? General , give him a chance ! He deserves at least that much for saving Akemi 's life again . I can 't afford to take that chance ! Two minutes to attack . Hello ? Hello ! Doctor ... I 'm sorry , Akemi . I did everything I could . I called everyone but the S.P.C.A. The only thing we can do now is hope their cells don 't multiply . Right , roger ! They 've made their way to the docks . What are these monsters ? How can they withstand our attack ? ! More , more , more , more , more ... Halt ! Doctor ... They haven 't found them yet ? The helicopters are still searching Tokyo Bay , but they can 't seem to find them . Maybe they 're heading out to sea . An undersea volcano erupted off the coast of the mainland ... Its initial burst has covered the monsters ... How are you ? Are you alright ? An undersea volcano erupted . Sanda and Gaira didn 't make it . Was it confirmed ? No ... The helicopters were unable to find anything .

 - Has he come to ? - No . Want to see him ? Will he live ? All I can say is that he survived the operation . You shouldn 't have bothered . I 'd have called you . Is he dead ? No , but he 's still unconscious . It 's been three days . I wonder if it 's still worth while to operate . If he could be moved ... you could start the experiment immediately . We 'll think about it . Anyone can be kept alive like that . - Who knows ? - We do . The experiment will kill him . We need a healthy man . There he is . Do you want to talk to him now ? I 'd rather wait . - Has anyone come to see him ? - He doesn 't want to see anybody . Why not pick one of your own men for the experiment ? - You 've got volunteers , right ? - Several , but we rejected them . But why him ? He has nothing to lose . That 's what we 're looking for . Why not pick a convict ? Offer him a pardon . That 's not an option . Does he have any chances of coming back ? Impossible to predict . It 's the first time we do it with a human being . I 'd like to meet him . I 'll call you . Wait a while . You forgot your things in the room . Thanks . I won 't need them . Claude Ridder ? That 's me . Could you spare a minute ? Or rather , a day ? We 're not policemen . I 'm from Crespel Research Center . Crespel ? Never heard of it . Nobody has . If you have no other plans , I 'd like to take you there . Is it far ? 50 Km . We have a car . - How 's the weather ? - Sunny . Then why not . - A taxi . - I 've got it . - Want to go by your house ? - No , thanks . Am I the man you 're looking for ? For sure . This is no kidnapping , let 's be clear about that . You 'd get no ransom , I have no family . How 's Crespel ? It 's a place that doesn 't even exist yet . - Is it picturesque ? - Not really . Are you tired ? I 've been asked that same question every hour for the last three weeks . Are you getting better ? Why so much interest in me ? Can you smoke ? Yes , I 'm cured . Cancer is my only worry . Are you glad to have survived ? I don 't know if I survived . We 're approaching . - You don 't seem to care . - I don 't care either way . What else could happen to me ? And what about something extraordinary ? Like in fairy tales ? You were right , it 's not picturesque . But it 's interesting . - Is this Crespel ? - Yes , this is it . I thought Crespel was a town . There is one three miles away , but it 's not part of Crespel . The boss will see you now . - Surprised ? - Frankly , yes . The center has been here for 15 years . In the region , they think we research agriculture , but we know nothing about that . Actually , we study time . - Have you solved it ? - Partly . And where do I come in ? I have a question , Mr. Ridder , answer it if you like . Please . I suppose you had a motive for attempting suicide . Have you changed your mind ? Perhaps it 's time to put the question again . - For who ? - For you . No , that hasn 't changed . You 'd do it again ? I 'm the perfect guinea pig , right ? The volunteer who doesn 't cling to life . If I accept , what are my chances of surviving ? 100 % if you were a mouse . Let me show you something . Time passing , no doubt . I 'll have to think about it . I liked your idea of a city agency ... to distribute time in the city . - I don 't think it would work . - Time would break it down . I always believed we should analyze a team of novelists ... paid to lay farfetched ideas on paper . Here are mice A and B. Have a close look . See any difference ? Don 't know . Is one a female and the other a male ? Both are males . But B is a pioneer . " A " has never been out of the jar . " B " has traveled in time and lived for one minute in the past . A hero . When did it happen ? Yesterday . With no ill effects . How can you be sure it traveled in time ? That 's the problem . We 're quite sure about it , but it 's hard to talk to a mouse . Technicians think of everything . You should have taught it to talk first . You 'll go back exactly one year . And it 'll only last a minute , no more . What if it kills me ? If you accept our treatment , it won 't happen . Where were you a year ago ? On vacation . I had an exceptional three month vacation last year . I was in France , at the Riviera . Are you sure ? My vacations define my memories . You 'll be in a sort of sphere . At your return you 'll wait four minutes for recovery Why four ? I 'll explain . Somehow , we can compare it ... to the compensation chamber used by divers . - Are you interested ? - Not much . Why the past instead of the future ? Wouldn 't it be more interesting ? I see your point . This isn 't too spectacular , but for the moment we can go no further . That 's why we start with short trips . An experience that might not look so interesting . No heart problems for me ? Nothing , not even a little ulcer ? Nothing . You 're quite healthy . See what I mean ? Suicide is good for your health . I 'm sure they must have mentioned that you 'll have to stay here a few days . On a diet ? Sort of . Just for four days . Will I have to sign insurance release before the experiment ? I imagine so . If the experiment fails , you could say I died at the hospital . No doubt . That 's clever . - Was it your first suicide ? - Yes . - With a gun ? - Yes . - I can 't picture you with a firearm . - Neither can I. That 's why I missed . - You aren 't afraid ? - No . I 've been afraid all my life , but not now . - Do you sleep well ? - Very well . - No headaches ? - No . We 'll see tomorrow . We have to watch the effects of T. 5 . It doesn 't seem to hurt you . - Now we just have to wait . - Three more days . What if I stay for years in the past ? It will last exactly 60 seconds . We know because of the mice . Will I wake up among pirates ? Lie down . We 'll close the door . You 'll go back a year , but you 'll be back one minute later . Disappointed ? A bit . I was expecting a kind of ... laboratory . Something electric . What if it fails ? Impossible . You 'll be back on September 5 , 1966 at 4 p.m. Why 4 p.m. ? It 's our chosen hour . We always send the mice at that time . - And they 've always come back . - So now it 's a habit I never imagined scientists would be superstitious . Why did you pick me ? Let 's say our computer did . - Out of millions , of course . - Naturally . - Good day . - Good day . There 's nothing to worry about . As we increase the dosage , T. 5. will make you sleepier . I talk in my sleep . That 's also a T.S. effect . And when you wake up ? I feel all right . Tomorrow , an hour before you enter the sphere ... you 'll get a larger dose . You 'll be drugged but perfectly lucid . Don 't worry . The treatment has prepared you for this stage . Can I move ? The subject must be totally passive . But he must be able to remember . Awake in his sleep . - Coming ? - Later . Two sea serpents and a few sharks . That 's about all . - Any good ? - Very good . Did you see many fish ? Two sea serpents and a few sharks . That 's about all . I don 't like those gadgets . You always say that . - Any good ? - Very good . Did you see many fish ? Let 's go out for dinner . If you want . - Coming ? - Later . It couldn 't end otherwise . About 4 months . You could do other things . How long will you be a shipping clerk ? As long as there are things to be shipped . I find it curious that you 've developed a reputation as a good packer . I think you could use that energy for something else . Hold a responsible position . I hate responsibility . I felt the same at your age . Let 's go and have some coffee . - Do you come from a rich family ? - Rather . At your age I had debts . - Any good ? - Very good . Seen many fish ? 2 sea serpents and a few sharks . We 've lost him ... It 's the same every time . - What time did she come ? - At 9 . 5,000 circulars by this evening , so we all have to work . And she 's done 90 ! In four hours ? One envelope per 2 minutes . Some performance . It 's a record . Is she pretty ? Who ? The record-breaker . - In a way . - In a way ? Send her in . To the left . Even your car is a problem . Shall we stop for lunch later ? If you like . I don 't know . Something about Catrine bothers me . Perhaps the fact that she doesn 't care for you . - Are you moody too ? - When I have nothing to say , yes . - What did she do when you met her ? - Nothing . - And now ? - Nothing . That 's not much . We 'll stop here and get a bite . Anyhow , he 's under the effect of T. 5 . - Seven minutes - He 's returned 5 times already . I feared that transition period . Why don 't we get him out before the four minutes ? Because he could go on like that for weeks . - We can wait . - If we wait , he 'll starve to death . It 's odd to see all this from a heated train . - Was it cold ? - Very cold . In a few minutes , we 'll pass by a town I liberated . - Just you ? - Almost . There were about 50 of us and a lot of Germans . Guns don 't agree with you . Never got used to them . A street might be named after you . Back then , it didn 't seem so much fun . - Why didn 't you come on Wednesday ? - I forgot . Come tonight , both of you . - Which two ? - You and Catrine . That 's a tough one . We separated . - How long were you two together ? - Seven years . Come alone then . Aren 't you afraid of that dirty wall behind you ? The papers on the table scare me more . We should decorate your office : paintings , tapestry . With a big picture , for example of an unpaid bill dated February 17 , 1951 . The bookkeeper took out a few commas . He 's an enemy of efficiency . You have erasers and no pencils ? I hate pencils . - What about erasers ? - No . They 're useless without pencils . - Hi . - Hi . Complements to the author , complements to the author ... Not very original ... I don 't know her , I don 't know what to say . A swimmer got drowned . - Is he dead ? - He 's been dead a long time . He was a good swimmer , must have swum for hours before drowning . - For hours , do you realize that ? - Claude . Be quiet . You don 't need me ! You just need me to be there ! You could have me embalmed in a corner . But I  m very much alive , I move , I come and go , I see people . If I couldn 't , I 'd kill myself . The more I give you , the worse you get ! I don 't think I understand you any longer . I 'm leaving . I 'm leaving tomorrow . It 's 3 p.m. 3 hours to go . 3 minutes ago it was 3 p.m ... In 3 weeks it will still be 3 p.m. In a century too . Time passes for everybody , but I 'm ... locked up in this room , time stays static . Look for your time . It 's 3 p.m. forever . Hello ? Hello ... I 'd like to point out that when you hear the third beep ... it  ll be exactly 3 o 'clock , 0 minutes , 0 seconds . - What ? - All right . Tomorrow at the same time , as agreed . Love to the family . For 100 million years algae and mollusks and reptiles ruled the earth until this firm was created ... I 'm approaching death at full speed . The earth will spin without me ... And I 'm here expressing ... our regrets to a customer ... for the loss of his shipment ... and to say we 'll do our best ... Are you ready ? Yes . - What 's a ... - What 's a mouse doing here ? - Did you say something ? - No . I just saw a mouse . Had you ever seen a mouse strolling through the beach ? Perhaps it 's on vacation . How did it go ? In a sense , a success . Let 's just say that for the time being we haven 't killed him . The rest ... A race against time : office time against outdoors time . - Who 's winning ? - I don 't know yet . She 's pretty . She looks like your apartment : well dressed , modest ... - I despise those things . - I like the way you despise everything . I love confusion , things that change . Am I like that ? Not really . Not at all . On the contrary , you 're ... surprising . You 're a swamp . A dark night ... I feel more like wringing your neck than smiling at you , I feel like sinking slowly into you . Until I reach the bottom . I can 't imagine Monique outside her showcase . You smell like the low tide , as a drowned person , as an octopus . - Back there , that beach . - This beach is me . I need you . I think I needed you from the moment at the office when they told me ... about a girl who hated envelopes ... and the job . Let 's make love . Right here , on the sand ? I 'd run away to a land without nights . You know something ? Your wife has a very nice behind . Listen , I 'll tell you what you 're seeing right this moment . You are by a window , right ? Let me see ... Everything is blue : the sky is blue , the sea , the sand , the city ... Everything is blue under the sun . Many pretty girls have already caught your eye . I miss you , Claude ... I must say that missing you is quite bothersome . It never happened before . I never cared . I never cared whether people were present or absent . Maybe there 's a white sail somewhere in the distance . I also see some seagulls spiraling down to the beach . Are there any seagulls on the Riviera ? They mean rain . It never rains there . We 're wasting our time , Ridder . We 'll never have those circulars ready for tonight . And you keep hitting that handle . - Everything is so beautiful . - It is . Here , nature does not have that sickening green of the fields . - Are you coming ? - Later . - What if I was married ? - I don 't know what I  d done . I probably wouldn 't have cared . Meeting you was no shock . Thing was ... you were different . You really looked out place in that office . So I knew the rest was irrelevant . - I might not have liked you . - No , that  s not possible . I was so scared that night , when we left the restaurant . Did you quit your job just to impress me ? Yes , were you impressed ? Not too much . Was the salary any good ? I made a living with it . You have beautiful eyes , has anyone ever told you that ? - And I want you . - Me too . See ? We are no pioneers . Shall we answer ? No . Catrine ... I love you . Do you hear me ? I love you . It was the only reason . Long before you died . And now I 'm dead . I 'm cold . I hear my own words . It 's that drug ... What are my chances of survival ? Ah , yes , 100 % if I were a mouse . So I must be a mouse because I 'm alive . They 'll come now ... Still four minutes to wait . And the mouse ? Where 's the mouse ? - You 're talking nonsense ! - So it may seem , no doubt . Unfortunately , I  m not . Claude , please stop . You scare me . That 's not my intention . I killed Catrine in Glasgow two months ago . We both left without telling anybody and I returned alone . I don 't believe it . You 're right and wrong . What does that mean ? You 're right , I can 't kill anybody . But you 're wrong , because I did . Impossible . I thought so too . What can you do ? We won 't be moving from here until streetcars are removed . But nobody can say buses are any better . Soon cars will be useless . A tip for your own good , sir : I recommend you get off and take the tram or you 'll miss the train . Do you have time , sir ? We 'll have to sew the cat 's eyes . - What ? - We have a cat , right ? - Are psychoses red ? - No , the future is red . And what about psychoses ? I get them mixed up . You 're awake too ? You go to the office in my place . - I guess I need you . - I 'm hard to live with . I don 't want to live with you . I want to be with you . Stay with me tonight . No ! Just don 't ever leave me . - I 'm afraid ... - Afraid ? Yes , I am afraid of losing you . To find myself alone tomorrow . To be without you tonight . If you want , we can spend the night at ... Last time he stayed 1 minute and 29 seconds in the area . He returned for 4.23 minutes . And now he 's been gone for 3.04 minutes . He 's trapped in that minute , endlessly reliving it . That gives us the best chance for recovery . I couldn 't stay there . - You can stay here if you like . - No , I 'm going home . Aren 't you sleepy ? She 'd be sad if you didn 't go . Sad ? She 's always sad . If I 'm here , if I 'm not ... when she 's asleep , when she wakes up ... Sometimes I think she 's sadness itself . You should be used to it , after five years . Wrong , six . I wonder if I should leave her . I can 't help her , nobody can . - She needs you . - That doesn 't do any good . Could you leave her ? Probably not . Sometimes I can 't stand it . I feel rusty . - I once left ... - And returned . Yes , two days later . She greeted me as if I  d been to the movies , and asked if I had eaten well . Claude Ridder , you 're really fed up . At that time , she wanted to have a house by the sea , but she was never sadder that when we went to the Riviera . Maybe she doesn 't like the sun . She loves the sun . She just can 't stop thinking that some day it will be gone . You can 't live with her or without her . So ? God created earth , then looked at His work and said : " I only hope it spins " . You go to sleep . I 'm not sleepy , really . - You don 't have the skills for the job . - Not particularly , I never write . This job doesn 't suit you . No job does . Offices make me sick . - They make you sick ? - Yes . - Do you know how much you 've earned this morning ? - No . Exactly 14 francs . Enough to buy a pack of cigarettes . Not much , especially because I won 't be coming back after lunch . Did you expect to get rich in a single morning ? How long did you hope to live on this job ? I don 't know . Tomorrow . Well . Here 's what we 'll do : I 'll give you the 14 francs I owe you , And you take me to lunch on that small fortune . - Why ? - Because I don 't care . You never buy anything . Almost daily , I buy bread , milk , matches , vegetables , tomatoes , mustard ... - Nothing for yourself . - I don 't need anything . - Buy a new sweater . - I already have two . Not much , isn 't it ? - No visits ? - No . I don 't want to see anyone . Do you mind if we stay up all night ? We usually go to bed very late . Well , this changes everything . Hello , how are you today ? - Is it good ? - Great . Something is wrong . I don 't know what time it is . They didn 't give me a watch . This is just too much ! No watches for time-travel . I could ... count the seconds ... and calm down . Four minutes are ... one ... two ... three ... four ... five ... - No . - Why not ? - No . - But , what kind of " no " ? Just " no " . - Why not ? - Just because . Because it 's not " yes " ? - Yes . - Ah , but you said " yes " . - But , no . - She can sure say no . Don 't they realize ? I 'm here ! You must know it ! I 'm back ! I 'm here ! No way . One travels just a few minutes and centuries have passed outside . The researchers died long ago ... and I 'm stuck here ... forgotten . - One minute . - We 'll get him in three minutes . Oh , there you are ! How have you been ? You 're on the trip , too . Are you all right ? Did you go far ? They can 't get you back either . We 're both in a mess . Oh , I know who you are . You 're the mouse I saw on the beach . You drew my attention . From time to time you tour my past . What would you say if I toured yours ? After all , you see , everything has an explanation . Everything is reasonable . You don 't have a watch either . And you don  t know how long we 've been here , either . Well , let 's move ! This isn  t over yet . I gotta get out of here . I must concentrate . It 's 10 : 30 , you know ... - I feel awful . - Are you sick ? If Catrine were dead , we 'd know it . It is not impossible , it 's quite simple . Do you know anything about Catrine ? You 've been talking about her for years . But do you know her ? Have you ever seen her ? No , never . The few people I knew never met her , either . Haven 't seen them for years , they don 't even know if I live with her or not . - It looks like you always hid her . - People bored her . Did she have any relatives ? No , no cousins , friends , or affections . No boss , no work . She didn 't even pay taxes ... Moreover , she couldn 't even go abroad  cause she didn 't have any papers . So , no one will notice her disappearance . No , nobody . People think we 've separated , just like you did . And you left her there ? Why bring her back ? Why are you telling me all this ? Because nobody knows . See what you do , you let me caress you . You would readily make love with me . However , you say you love that man . I am , you are , he is , we love , you love , they go to bed . I caress ... your knees . Then your thighs ... Because I feel lonely tonight . I am lonely . I 'd be delighted if Catrine left me . I once met a man ... You 're not listening to me . I 'm listening to your fingers . Your face has changed since last week . Because last week I was sure ... that I 'd never write again . Last year you said exactly the same thing . I 'll show you something you 'll like . - Is it big ? - No , it 's tiny . You 'll love it precisely because it 's so small . Animal , vegetable , sidereal , mineral ? A blend of all four . I want to stay with you tonight . - What 's wrong ? - I 'm terrified . Don 't say " terrified " , say " afraid " . Not at all . What 's the difference between ' fear ' and ' terror ' ? Fear is when you 're hot ; Terror is when you 're cold . You just slept a couple of hours . You need to sleep . One of my eyes wants to read and the other one wants to sleep . You are absolutely ... I don 't know what . But you are really something . - Now I 'm afraid too . - Afraid of what ? Death ? Not exactly . - I 'm afraid of not dying . - Well , I never heard that before . Are you there ? Will you come back late ? Yes , he lives quite far from here . It 's too hot in here . Come with me . I called a cab . Glasgow is too gloomy . Buy me some oranges . - You okay ? - Yes . Can 't you sleep ? I wanted the light on . Come . Come closer . I think simple things are harder to understand . But you finished your studies . Yes , but I never paid attention at school . But you read ? Books don 't teach everything . One day Claude made me believe ... that trams keep balance on the rails ... because the power cables prevent them from capsizing . I 'd never thought of it . I thought they ran on gasoline . Okay , this is called " The Martian point of view . " - Missed him by two minutes . - Two minutes , two months , same thing . T.5. has worn off now . Three circulars , at least . We have claims about that . We have to write a new text for the reminder . You 'll have it next week . Launch day is the 17th . Let 's say 5 days , today is the 22nd ... it should be out by the 25th so we can face the payments . We haven 't yet addressed the subject of how many pages . Forty more pages won 't cost the same . We need to cut them down . Who 's going to do it ? We can 't send them before the 17th , anyway . The B mouse traveled one minute in the past . A hero ! When did this happen ? Yesterday . And he looks okay . How do you know it really happened ? Well , that 's the problem . If , during the war , someone would have told me I 'd be speaking about this ... Where are you going ? I 'll go get some cigarettes . What are you doing here ? What ? What are you doing here ? I couldn  t sleep . I was afraid I 'd die . So I came here . So in the morning , when you left , you 'd find me dead in the stairway , or just asleep . Come with me . Come . I found myself in the bathroom with a girl I didn 't know . She was very attractive . Every man 's dream . Nothing happened . I just washed her the way she asked me to . - Did you ever see her again ? - Several times . In my dreams . " Dear Sir , we acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 24th ... " and we are pleased to blah blah . " We are sad to know that blah blah . We believe that pa pa , " We assure you that blah blah and we offer our whatyoumacallit . " We will send it soon . " We hope it arrives in perfect conditions ... " Accept our sincere apologies . Yours truly , Claude Ridder . " I killed Catherine in Glasgow 2 months ago . He 's delayed . We needed it yesterday . He can work all night . - How can he work without a pencil ? - He never has a pencil . Does he know we need that text for tomorrow at the most ? He makes mistakes . He can 't even spell " tomorrow " . - It 's late . - Isn 't he tired ? - And that spot ... - Has he seen that spot ? You 're right about green and the countryside . What if a man is allergic to green ? Maybe green corrupts the cells . That would be strange , huh ? Thousands of scientists invent can openers , detergents ... but not this , that could change everything . I think that 's the secret . It 's so simple nobody thought of it . We won 't eat any salad for a month , to prove it . If you buy a boat , I 'll learn to steer ... If I wasn 't sad about this , I 'd find another reason by nightfall . I 'm a burden for you . If I swam in money ... If you were rich , I 'm not sure I would have liked you . I 'd have pretended to be poor and disinherited . I 'd have visited your boss every other month ... to see that he gave you some money . ¡ A tree ! It 's not a tree , it 's a bush . Yes , but trees are less and less frequent . I pointed out a syringe and you said it didn  t count . A syringe , are you sure ? - Are you sure ? - Yes . Ok , leave the other and take that one . - Yes , that 's better . - I 'll tell them . But the other ... I 'm sure I 'm not wrong . It was you who gave me the false papers during the war . No , I wasn 't . Don 't you recognize me ? I 'm Claude Ridder . In 1943 , my name was Claude Rabois . You can 't possibly know me . I also had false papers during the war . You have a calcite . - Is it serious ? - No really . But you 've killed her all the same . That 's 90 francs . Shall I come back ? - Are you tired ? - Yes , I 'm exhausted . - What did you do ? - Nothing . I heard people talk . - And you ? - I didn 't say a word . What did they talk about ? Nothing . I wasn 't listening . - What are you looking for ? - Something to eat . I bought some spinach . Plants ... I 'd like a huge herring . I can 't do anything . Sometimes I wonder who you are , exactly . Something blurred ... More and more blurred ... I shrink in water . You never talk about your writing . I don 't write much . We can have lunch together if you want . The scariest thing is that if you killed her , it was the perfect crime . They 're going to close it . OK , I 'll dress . I like it when you wear all mauve . Imagine for a moment that God created cats to His image . - Cats ? - Yes , cats . Thousands of years later , or two hours , I don 't know , He created men ... - Men ? - Yes . With the only purpose of serving cats . As their slaves . - As their slaves ? - Yes . Cats were given lucidity ... and men neurosis and the passion for building and possessing things . - I see . - No , you don 't . Men were created just for the benefit of cats . - Do you get it ? - Yes , I do . There you go . All civilization serves no purpose ... but to feed and give comfort to cats . - To cats . - Exactly . That 's why men created so many things ... that secure cats ' well being : fishermen , cushions , carpets , radiators ... Maybe even the radio , because cats love music . I 'm glad you 've figured out who we are and why we 're here . That had always bothered me . Me too . You see , all you have to do is think . Claude ! Look . What is it ? A beetle . You 've been like that for two hours now . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . Where 's the cat ? Did you sleep with her ? - Does it bother you ? - Does it amuse you ? You can be very superficial . I 've always dreamed of having a particularly inept employee . To fire her ... and then run away together . When I collect on my three months notice , we could go away together . Anywhere . And then ? Then we would come back . We would come back . - Another coffee ? - Yes , thanks . I would like to know why you picked me for this . Let 's say a computer did . - Among millions , I suppose . - Of course . - Good afternoon . - Good afternoon . Our oldest employee . Maybe he 's the computer who chose me . This will make him feel good . He needs to cool down . Can you picture yourself buried in this cold mud all alone ? You could make a cemetery guide . It would be a best seller : " Luceram Cemetery . One shinbone . Modest , but well located . " Another one : " Three shinbones . Worth a detour . " " No shinbone . Avoid " . I 'd rather live here than get buried here . This kind of situation only happens in books . - And when they happen , you don 't take advantage of them . - We 'll see . I don 't mean to scare you . I killed Catrine two months ago in Glasgow . I went away with her without telling anyone ... and I came back alone . I don 't believe you . You 're right and wrong . What 's that supposed to mean ? You 're right , I 'm not capable of killing . You 're wrong ... because I did it nevertheless . Impossible . I thought that as well . That day in Glasgow was very cold . Catrine had never traveled so far . Neither had I. She didn 't like the city , she found it gloomy . I think I had never seen Catrine so depressed before . She was completely ... We haven 't slept all night . Tomorrow , I 'll be exhausted . Let 's try to catch some sleep . It 's strange to wake up just when I was thinking about sleeping . She was asleep . And the strangest thing was that she smiled ... in her sleep . I had never seen her doing that . It was the first time . She seemed relaxed ... happy . That 's how it happened . I looked at Catrine ... 29 minutes . What shall we do ? And the risk ? We have to try something , because the T.5. no longer works . Is it you , Claude Ridder ? Yes , it 's me . Wiana went out . She went to the post office . OK , I 'll wait . Come in , if you want . We 're two girls in the bathroom . Which one will you prefer ? The left one or the right one ? The right one . Or ... No , the right one . Bad decision . I 'm Nicole , I arrived yesterday . Do you mind if I take a shower ? You can soap my back while we talk . What do you do at the office ? Sometimes I think . I choose an object and I think about it . Here 's a pencil . I focus and I notice it 's a red pencil . It 's red on the outside , but it writes black . That proves that appearances can be deceptive . It 's a regular pencil . Average size , the kind we can find anywhere . It has a point ... as a pencil . When you push it , it rolls ... as a pencil , obviously . If held vertically , it looks like the trunk of a tree , straight and smooth . In the same sense , it looks like a pencil . That seems to prove that it 's indeed a pencil . However , I never use pencils . Why do I have one now ? No doubt because tables are made to hold pencils . I like your story . Keep drawing . There are other things besides pencils ; we can think about erasers , almanacs , papers ... She received over 150 complaints ... and she just sat on them . We were 300 letters behind schedule . And now ? - Are we up to date ? - Even ahead . Claude told me this morning he responded to a letter ... we haven 't received yet . I 'm exhausted . I just slept 3 hours last night . On top of that , I dreamed I had 100 pages left . It 's going to be a nice day . At sea one knows these things . If people are already up ... Everything 's ready . - Is it much ? - Quite a lot . 5 whole years . It will be just a few days . Even though I make love to other women , I 'm still attracted to you . It hurts that you make love to other women . I don 't know what to tell you . Do you understand me ? Yes , Claude , I do . That 's what makes me sad . If Prometheus hadn 't had his vulture ... Speaking of vultures , I bought chicken for tonight . I don 't know what to do . I can 't concentrate on the job . Walk , I don 't know , do something . What did I do this morning ? I stared at the telephone . What 's so special about her ? Nothing , but I want her . I would do anything . Even send Catrine to hell . Well , call her . I don 't have her number . All I can do is wait . A kiss ? - Let 's stay here . - Fine by me . - He 's all right . - He 's all tied up . Let 's stay some more . That minute runs away , but I chase it . I concentrate . I 'm in the water . The sun has come down ... Catrine is there , on the beach . The water is warm ... I swim . I see the bottom . I want to take a bath . Thanks . I 'm sorry I can 't speak French . But I assume you understand English . Sure . So , where 's Catrine ? Catrine ! - After all ... - Yes , after all . Nothing . Do you have to go ? I should . Stay with me . I can 't come up with an excuse every day . I 'll write you an encyclopedia of excuses so you can use them . You 're already late . Punctually late : never more than an hour . And rarely less . You see many fish ? Two sea serpents , some sharks ... Nothing 's happening . Nothing changes . It 's strange . I 'm going to die . Catrine ... do you see ? You were right . Catrine ... I 'd like to see the mouse . He 's coming back more frequently . 30 seconds since last time . It 's not much . A storm at 7 a.m. is unusual . It takes everybody out of their beds . Who ? God ... the workers ... You don 't understand ... Not today . You 're all blind , luckily for you . People are afraid , because their lives are hard and discouraging . At those moments , they need to be told the opposite . I don 't believe it . It won 't last . It all ends rather quickly . When you feel good , that is frightening . You know you 'll lose everything someday ; it 's barely bearable . No matter what , it 's unbearable . Time drags on when you 're hungry . It takes 3 months or 60 years to die ... Strange , isn 't it ? One adapts even to cancer . Choose something . Carrots are good for the skin . Spinach for influenza ... And fruits are good for your health . I think I can 't help you . I wish I hadn 't met you . What happened , happened . - Something to drink ? - I can 't , it makes me sleepy . Have you been here long ? Good morning , how are you ? There you go , now we can work . We haven 't brought all the papers . Good morning , kitty . Glad to see you today . Did she feed you today ? " I must say I don 't think she gives me enough food " . Yes , she 's a little stingy . Stingy . But outside you would eat even less . " That doesn 't mean I should starve in an apartment " . You exaggerate . " If I don 't do it , you won 't hear me " . " I don 't like her records . " They 're just noise and they all sound alike . " I had more fun on the streets . I had friends there " . We 're your friends . You can talk to us . " But you 're not so clever " . Sophie thinks we are . What are you reading ? Where did you find this ? - What does that mean , exactly ? - I don 't know . It 's boring to explain . I don 't give a damn . Why do you say that ? I don 't understand it . It has nothing to do with me . - And with you ? - Nothing . It 's a little silly or a little sad , it depends on how you look at it . I 'm confused . I love you very much . I love you more than very much . You don 't say " more than very much " . - You can 't say it that way . - But you can think it , can 't you ? I used to wake up at night . I hated it . I stayed awake so as not to wake up . Now it doesn 't happen anymore . I sleep well until morning . I sleep well , don 't I ? Have you ever thought about killing Catrine ? Many times . - I believe you . - You do ? I thought of what you said . I think you said the truth . You may have killed Catrine without anybody knowing . And why did I kill her ? To end it all . To end her suffering . As you told me , she had a terminal illness , right ? Periods vary . There 's nothing we can do . Then he 's lost . We had gone there to meet an author . We got a room in a little hotel . It was cold . We turned on the gas heater . She took sleeping pills . When I looked at her , she was asleep . And the strangest thing was that she smiled ... in her sleep . I had never seen her doing that . It was the first time . She seemed relaxed ... happy . She was no longer afraid . That 's how it happened . On going out , I noticed the room was very cold . It was very cold . I smelled gas ... The heater was off , but the gas was on . That was all . I looked at her , smiling in her sleep , and I went out . When I came back half an hour later , she was dead . The cops were already there . Claude , I don 't know why you 're lying to me . How is it that you weren 't arrested ? They thought it had been an accident . That simple ? It was an accident . I lied to see if you 'd believe me . The flame must have died out while I was out . I came back ... late ... at night ... Much later . Did she really die there ? Yes . For a moment I was glad ... It was awful , but I was glad . It all happened in her sleep , she didn 't suffer . Then I realized she was gone for good , that I would never see her again . And I couldn 't stand it . It got worse and worse . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . George is dead . George who ? Slovain . He 's dead . I know . He died eight months ago . You knew ? For eight months . His wife wrote me shortly after he died . And you didn 't say anything ? You were depressed , so I didn 't tell you . Imagine a man ... who hid all the bad news ... to spare his wife . He would hire actors to replace ... people who died . He would buy all the newspapers so she couldn 't find any . He would have to cover the world . It would cost a lot . It 's ghastly . What 's ghastly ? Everything . Everything is ghastly . Even when you 're with me .

Page 10 , twelfth line : " Tlön " is missing the dieresis . Same page , fourteenth line : " solipsism " is misspelled . There 's no " c " in it . It looks funny but I 'm sure . Page 11 is all right . Page 12 , eighth ... no , ninth line : " visual and tactile . " It 's been more than an hour . We 'll never get him back . His pulse is slow . He 's lost a lot of blood . Can we move him ? Call the hospital . Hurry . We 'll have to check all our figures .

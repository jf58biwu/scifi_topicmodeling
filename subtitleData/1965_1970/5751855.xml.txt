 Working late tonight , huh , boys ? Making money , making money . Getting awful stuffy in here , boys . A little fresh air 's not going to hurt a thing . Not a thing . Hurry it up . The new shift is already in the front office . You only got three minutes . Come on , come on , let 's go ! An overload of gas . It just isn 't possible , Mr. West . It just isn 't possible . Well , what do you think happened ? Oh , extra pressure hit this pipe . Somehow , somebody , something pumped it in . Say , uh , you Secret Service men get on a case pretty fast . Is there any money missing ? Not a penny . A little scorched around the edges maybe , but all six million still here . Well , the third man died this morning . Burns and concussion . What about the guard ? Foxx . Still on the critical list . What about his chances ? To quote the doctor , don 't make any bets . Mr. West . Yes , Mr. Fall . No more guessing about it now . These plates are a different alloy than our plates . They have a pitted surface . Ours are smooth and clear . These are counterfeit . Want to see them ? No , I 'll take your word for it . You know , that is really smart . Putting counterfeit plates into our own presses , taking out the real ones , and then blowing up the mint to make it look like an accident . I guess they figured we 'd never know the difference . Do you realize , Jim , that they can print millions of dollars of this ? Hundreds of millions of dollars and none of it counterfeit . We couldn 't touch them . This could almost destroy the entire United States economy . Morning , sir . Good morning . Enjoy the parade ? Yes , what I saw . Your room is number one . Right at the top of the stairs . I 'm sorry I don 't have anyone to help you with your bag . They 're all outside watching the parade . Oh , that 's all right , I can manage . Thank you . Someone else just dropped in on me - from the ceiling - and went out that window . Who was it ? There 's no time to lose . Go to the hospital and talk to the guard . What do you know about the guard ? He has something to tell you . Something to tell me ? What ? Do you know ? Just hurry , please . There 's no time . You must go to him now . What is he to you ? My father . I 've got to get back before they miss me . Who are " they " ? My father will tell you . All right . We 'll go together . Please let me go . If you keep me here , you 'll be putting me in danger . What 's your name ? Corinne . If you please , Mr. West . Uh , you can have just a few minutes . Mr. Foxx is in critical condition . Well , uh ... that 's peculiar . Uh , the doors don 't have locks . Excuse me , Doctor . He 's dying . He 's been crushed . You 'd better notify his daughter right away . Daughter ? He didn 't mention having a daughter . A young woman . Didn 't she come to visit him ? Nobody visited him . Who 's Corinne ? If you find Corinne ... you 'll find death . Well , James ... What 's the matter ? You don 't look your happy self . I 'm not . I just came from the doctor 's . No broken ribs , but they sure are sore . Oh , now , if that rib crusher had been a female , you wouldn 't have minded the least little bit , now , would you ? How about the money ? Any of it show ? Aah , not a single bill - anywhere . What are they waiting for ? Why haven 't they moved it ? Well , for one thing , they know you 're around . That 's for sure . First the human fly , then , uh , Foxx and Corinne . The lovely , lethal Corinne . Find her and you 'll find death . Hmm ... Just don 't press your luck , huh ? Oh ... I , uh , took the liberty of ... Thank you . Of , uh ... ordering a small libation , James , just as a painkiller , huh ? To money . It smells like almonds . Prussic acid . Well , she didn 't come out here . We missed you at the parade , Corinne . Where did you go ? I had some business to see to . Please , let me down . Business ? But surely we have no secrets from each other . I went to see my father . Oh , yes . Poor man . I think I 'll try my luck on number 10 . Mr. Trevor thinks he 'll try his luck on ... number ten . Number seven this time . And wish me luck . Warren . I 've stalked bigger game . This one has sharp teeth , Warren . I 'll take the bite out of him . He looks wild , untamed . All the more , a better specimen for my land in Africa . Still a dream ? Not for long . It will soon be a reality . I 'll buy that land and have my Africa . I 'll build it into an empire . Nothing , and no one , will stop me . I 'll possess it ... if I have to stuff Mr. West and hang him up as a trophy . Excuse us , sir . Sometimes the performers get carried away . Did they hurt you ? Pain 's all mine . I wouldn 't say you were exactly Cupid , Mr. Trevor . You know me , Mr ... West . James West . I 've seen your picture . Everyone knows the great game hunter . Take her down , Janet . Miss Coburn is my animal trainer . And your target ? My bareback rider . Excellent performer . Thank you , Corinne . You may go . Girl of many talents . You 're quite a trainer , Mr. Trevor . I 've devoted my life to animals . Most of those you see here , I 've captured . Many a species never seen before outside of their native habitat . Two-legged or four-legged ? Are they better off in cages ? The circus is only their temporary home . Mr. West , why are you here ? I 'm with the government . We expect a large amount of counterfeit money to flood the city . Public activities , this circus , would be natural places to pass off money . The circus doesn 't give its first public performance for another week . We 'll be glad to cooperate and take every precaution . Good . If you don 't mind , I 'd like to look around your place a little bit more - where the concessions are , the ticket booths - anyplace where money would be exchanged . so I can stake out my men . Delighted . Miss Coburn will give you a tour of the area . Janet . Follow me . Anytime . Sirang . Come on , boy . Come on . Attaboy . He , uh ... He wouldn 't bite the hand that feeds him , would he ? Most mammals rarely fight over a kill . They only kill what they need to eat . Meat eaters do very little chewing , actually . Some of their molars are degenerated and others are adapted for crunching bones . Interesting . Lions are really very gentle , given proper love and care . But like people , don 't turn your back on them . Sirang . The Loxodonta africana ... the last of the Proboscideans . A once numerous group whose history spans 58 million years . I , uh , find you most informative , Miss Coburn . Looking for something , Mr. West ? As a matter of fact , yes . I was checking the entrance and exits , anyplace where people might congregate . You know , all this arouses my curiosity in the most interesting species on the grounds . And what might that be ? Not what - who . Warren Trevor . A fascinating man . The animals are all entirely responsive to Mr. Trevor and myself . They can be gentle ... or they can revert to their basic nature , at command . I think I 've made the general situation clear . Mr. Trevor can fill you in on anything else . I 'd like to know more about Janet Coburn - intelligent , beautiful ... We should be getting back . What 's , um ... What 's out there ? A reproduction of the African veldt area . We sometimes turn our tigers and lions loose out there for exercise . It 's a restricted area , Mr. West . Thank you for the warning . Anytime . Then you don 't mind if I continue to look around anyplace where I think I might find the money . Enjoy the circus , Mr. West . Mr. West . Corinne wants to see you . Where ? No , no - don 't look around . Be casual . Follow me . She 's waiting for you on the other side of the rock . Mr. West . Whatever have you been doing ? I 've been trying to make friends with the animals . How dreadful . Now , you might have been drowned or crushed . I think that little fellow had other things in mind . You shouldn 't go wandering around by yourself , Mr. West , in a restricted area . What 's that sound I keep hearing ? Oh , there are so many mating calls in the jungle . One cannot keep up with all of them . That mating call sounds a little rusty . Mr. Trevor asked me to come and look for you . He 'd like you to be his guest . He 's entertaining the tribal chief of the Cobanu Province in Central Africa . Don 't you think I might be a wet blanket ? Not if I dry you off first . You might well wind up joining our circus , Mr. West . Afraid not . I get dizzy more than three feet off the ground . You could , uh , join our tumblers . They work pretty close to the ground . Oh , no , thanks . I 've met your tumblers . All I need now is a tightrope ... or am I walking one already ? You don 't think very positively , Mr. West , do you ? I might ... about you . That 's exactly what I was hoping . So serene in here . Almost like the jungle . I know about the birds and the bees . It 's , uh ... it 's your tiger I 'm not sure of . He 's as docile as a kitten . Not like his trainer . Yes ... Like his trainer . What , uh , kind of food do they serve at African feasts ? African food . You know , the funny thing ... I hear a certain sound , like ... metallic grinding . Not from here , you don 't . It 's , uh , still lingering . I told you - it was only a mating call . Like a printing press " mating " money . Jan ? Where are the plates ? Somehow I don 't seem to hear you , Mr. West . You help me get the plates , and I 'll help you get some free years . Prison 's terrible for the complexion . I thought you were only interested in wooing me . You 're getting warm . Maziwah ... nyama ... chibuku . What 's that ? African dishes - delicious - you 've never tasted anything like them . And I 'm very hungry . We mustn 't keep the chieftain waiting . Keep him company , Sirang ... while I freshen up . Nice kitty . Ah , Mr. West . Welcome . You know Corinne , of course . And may I present Chief Vonoma and his entourage from Kubana . Formerly a French protectorate in Africa . Do help yourself , while the chief and I continue our business discussion . Thank you . But to purchase an animal domain as vast as you envisage from my kingdom will take a very vast sum of money , Mr. Trevor . We would not sell to the French when they were through . What would you do with a piece of Africa , Mr. Trevor ? Every man has his dream . Mine is to own and protect and cherish nature and her creations from man . Man is the most predatory beast on the face of the globe . He kills wantonly - animals kill merely to survive . There 's already sound testimony of man 's senseless carnage of other living creatures . Man is the only animal capable of changing his environment , the only species to render other species extinct . Not to mention his own . The Great Hawk has been ruthlessly hunted for over 300 years . The last known specimen was killed in 1844 . Ah , dinner is about to be served . Corinne , show Mr. West to his place . Some wine , sir ? Thank you . He 's toying with us . We 'll never get out of this alive . Some of the most delicious torture I 've ever encountered . But I can 't figure out how you come into this . Want the truth ? Money - lots of money . I wanted to live in my own world , not his animal world , so I introduced my father to him , and he used him to get the plates - double-crossed him . Then why did you come back here after leaving me at the hotel ? I thought I could still help him . I didn 't know he was dead until I got here . Now I want to avenge him . But I can 't even help myself . Where are the plates ? The printing press is in a tent in the veldt area . How do I get in there ? You are in - and you can 't get out . He has spies and guards everywhere . Would you care for some python-skin jellied hors d 'oeuvres ? Keep your eye on me . You 'll know when to make a break for it . How about you , my dear ? Would you care to join us ? Shall we dine ? Thank you . Getting along famously , I see . Like a couple of old friends . Where are the dancing girls ? I have a couple of dancing bears . They might enjoy waltzing with you . Not me , I have two left feet . I 'm impressed with your intention , Mr. Trevor . But how would your government feel about the purchase ? A large sum of money would leave its borders . Mr. West is a spokesman for my government . He understands that I can produce the money . We understand you 're going to try . You see , Chief Vonoma , my government doesn 't stop a private citizen from doing business with the head of an outside state . They wouldn 't prevent me from buying a piece of Africa . Would they , Mr. West ? No , not as long as it isn 't Treasury money . Hmm . $ 10 million ? Excellent wine , Mr. Trevor . $ 20 million ? Forty ? Fifty . I will consider the matter . But until such time as the entire sum is placed in a Swiss bank , I would be concerned by your country 's attitude . Aren 't you going after them ? So ... there are three . Mr. West , you try my patience . Worse ... you scared off the chief . That 's our good deed for the day . And your last . Return the plates and save your skin . You can 't hope to pull this off . I can 't , hmm ? And as for skins , I have a skin game in mind for you . These fresh animal skins dry and shrink at a very rapid rate under the hot sun . You 'll literally be squeezed to death , but not before your eyeballs pop . But in a sense , your mission is successful , Mr. West . You wanted to find the plates , listen carefully . There they are in the tent . Being used for the purpose your government intended . Come , Janet , I need you to help me salvage my deal with the chief . No . I want to stay . Boy , I sure clowned things up just great . I 'm sorry , Mr. West . Just call me Jim . Save your energy . You 're only working against yourself . Why don 't they just shoot us and get it over with ? And spoil their fun ? You can 't say we haven 't gone native . We 'd better think of something , Jim . These skins are drying out fast . If these skins are dry enough , maybe I can get them to split . Oh . Jim ! Jim ! Jim ! They 're splitting ! Thanks for my life , Mr. West , but I don 't think I 'll keep it very long . First things first . We 've got to get those plates . The second thing - keep down . Get me some more paper . I got to get these plates out of here . Take off . Well , I can 't leave you here . Take off , will you ? I 'll be right behind you . I got to destroy that money . Go on ! Smoke , Mr. Trevor ! Mr. Trevor ! Mr. Trevor ! Smoke ! Smoke ! Smoke ! There must be another way out . He set fire to the tent . He 's out there somewhere . He 's got the plates . I must say I find Mr. West a worthy adversary . He has an animal cunning I find challenging . I want the satisfaction of his blood . The hunt is mine . Warren , no ! No ! Sirang ... go ! It would seem that Mr. West has tamed the beast in you , Janet . Poor foolish Janet . Throw her in the cage . And you ... I 'll have your head on a pole . Throw him in the cage , too . They are running , Mr. Trevor . Wait here . We have to keep moving . I 'll keep moving if I have to crawl . He 's worse than any of his animals . He ought to be caged . Mr. Trevor ! Good work . Time is running out for our friends . Jim , look out ! You first ... and then Mr. West . I 'd love to have you teach me something about soothing the savage beast . You know , there are some nights I actually roar ... r-r-roar ! Neither you nor your friend have been very nice to me . Well , you weren 't particularly ... Hey ! Jim ! The key on the pole . Relax , Artemus , I 'll get you out . Get me out ? Who said anything about wanting to get out ? Somehow I didn 't think I 'd see you again . I had to come back for my clothes . They 're in my tent , and they ought to be dry by now . The last time I saw you , you weren 't very nice to me - tried to tie me up in those animal skins . You wouldn 't want a woman to be consistent , would you ? Maziwah ... nyama . What 's that ? It 's that , uh , African feast we never got to finish . Say , everybody else is gone . Why don 't the four of us have dinner ? Delighted . You said it was delicious . Very delicious . Um ... I 'll change clothes . Artemus ... Hmm . Entertain the girls while I 'm gone , will you ? I have to change my clothes . You locked ... you locked the door , Jim . Jim , you 've locked me in ! That 's right , Artemus . If I may , please . Thank you . Now , then ... I ever tell you about the time I was locked in a hotel in New Orleans with nothing but a small field pack and a , uh , bowie knife ? There we are . Thank you . Why didn 't you think of this two hours ago ? I did . Shall we dine , ladies ?

 NARRATOR : Shortly before dawn , a spaceship landed near Phillipsburg , Colorado , bringing to Earth a strange and ominous experimental cargo : two dozen spores . After exposure to the Earth 's atmosphere , each will develop and grow into a perfectly formed alien . On the success of this experiment rests the possibility of future shipments numbering hundreds , perhaps thousands of alien invaders , and possibly , the future of the human race . Why don 't you get yourself a grown-up car instead of that little scooter ? Maybe I don 't want to get fat and lazy like some guys . You call that fat ? That 's solid muscle . How they doing up there ? There 's about 40 tons of dirt sitting all over the road . Listen , if you see the guy with the dozer , tell him to get it out of low , will ya ? All right . ( tires squealing ) Stick around . I 'll be back . Good hunting . ( siren wailing ) ( tires squealing ) ( siren approaching ) ( siren fades out ) ( crackling ) NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here , that they 've taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Gene Hackman ... Mark Miller ... Patricia Smith ... John Randolph ... Wayne Rogers . ( sighs ) Let me ask you once again , Mr. Jessup : Are you absolutely certain that what you saw is not what Sergeant Goldhaver here reported ? You mean the disappearing act ? That 's right . ( chuckles ) I 'm afraid not . You must have ! You were right there . I 'm not saying it didn 't happen . I just didn 't see it . I 'd been walking along the road , and when this truck came at me , I guess I threw myself into the ditch . Must have blacked out a couple of seconds . And what happened to the people in the truck ? Ernie , we don 't know that there were any people in the truck . Except the driver , of course , and he probably wandered off in the woods- - shock and everything . The boys are out looking for him . They 'll probably find him . Well , I told you I saw two ... Ernie , could we talk for a sec ? Mr. Jessup , you 'll excuse us ? When we get back , you can be on your way . Ernie . Sit down , Ernie . You don 't believe me , do you ? Ernie , sit down . All right , how about it ? How about what ? Oh , come on , now . You know what I 'm talking about . You mean , maybe I 've been hoisting a couple . Well ? Not today . Not for two years . Ernie , level with me . I am leveling with you . I haven 't been near a bottle since I came off suspension . Look , how much time you got before retirement , huh ? One year and three months . Why ? What do you think 's going to happen when I send up that report ? I don 't know . Oh , yes , you do . You 'd know that whoever wrote it was up to his eyeballs in booze . Is that what you think ? Look , Ernie , ever since I 've been here , you 've had a good record . One of the best . I 'd kind of like to think maybe you 're telling the truth . I am telling the truth- - to you and in that report . Yeah , and to that kid from the radio station . Oh , Ernie , I wish you hadn 't have done that . I saw it ! The whole thing ! No , you think you saw it ! Now , listen , you go on suspension again , and your retirement starts right now . No pension . Tell me something . Could you swear that what you saw was not an optical illusion or something ? I don 't know . Maybe it was . That 's exactly what it was . Come on . We 'll tell Mr. Jessup he can be on his way . NARRATOR : Several hours ago , a radio newscast carried a strange report : A deputy sheriff in Phillipsburg reported an accident in which the passengers vanished in a burst of flame . A policeman 's delusion or evidence of invaders ? David Vincent travels to Phillipsburg to discover which . Look , we already told you it was an optical illusion . That 's all . Well , what if it wasn 't ? What if the sergeant really did see that ? Well , if you 'd gotten here a couple of minutes earlier , you could have talked to the other eyewitness . Now , he said nothing happened . Maybe you would have believed him . Wait a minute . Another " eyewitness " ? That 's right . A fella named Jessup . My man just put him on a bus . I guess you missed him . What did he look like ? A guy in his mid-30s , sandy-haired , gray suit , I think . No , it was brown . Say , he was just leaving when you came in . You probably saw him outside . Yes , I think I did . Where did this accident happen ? What difference does it make ? I 'd like to know . A bend in the road about a hundred yards this side of the Milford junction . Okay , thanks . Ernie , you , uh , you 'd better start changing this report . I wonder if you could tell me , is this the way to Milford ? You lost ? Yeah , I guess so . I rented this thing . Forgot to ask for a map . Take your first right down here . It 's about 25 miles . Okay , thanks . You want a ride ? If you don 't mind stopping while I use a phone . No . No trouble . Yeah , my car broke down a few miles back . I got an appointment in Milford . Harper , Dave Harper . Insurance . I 'm Tom Jessup . I 'm a ... salesman . What do you sell ? Huh ? Jewelry ? Case like that ? Seeds . No kidding . Everything started from seeds once . Even you and me . Never thought about it that way . Can 't tell . They might come up with a whole new species someday . Of what ? Who knows ? Maybe even people . There 's a coffee shop . They must have a phone . Mr. Harper ... I wonder if you 'd mind locking your car . My sample case , you know ? Sure . ( tires squealing ) ( engine sputtering ) ( rock ' n ' roll playing inside coffee shop ) I guess I 'll take it in with me . Some people , you know ? I know some people have some pretty big mouths . DAVID : Coffee , please . ( music stops ) ( coin clinking in slot ) ( phone dialing ) Wow , baby brother . You really dragged us to a great joint . I told you . They got good food . Yeah , I can see . They got samples all over the menu . No , they weren 't damaged but three of our people perished . JESSUP : I know , but I have to get the spores to the incubation point . All right . Where will you meet me ? Good . I 'll get this man to drop me off . Hal , put it back . Mister , those kids stole your suitcase . ( tires squealing ) I 'll call a doctor . No , call the police . Call the police . What do you think 's in it ? Well , it 's got to be something we didn 't have before . So long , fella . That was a real dumb move . We lost him , didn 't we ? I mean about taking that thing . Shut up . You saw the way he put us down . That didn 't mean you had to steal from him . You , too , huh ? Why don 't you both just clear out of here ? What if he calls the cops ? If he did , it 's your fault . If you hadn 't started to panic back there , nobody would have seen me take it . They were looking right at you . They were watching the fight . Now ... let 's see what we got . You want me to try ? The guy next door has some tools . Be right back . ( coins clink in slot ) ( dialing ) This is Jessup . The spores have been taken . No , they don 't know what they have . I can 't . I 'm driving a stolen car . You 'll have to pick me up . Yes , but hurry . If they manage to get it open , it could be dangerous . All right , the kids don 't matter , but Jessup does and so does that case . So how can you call him a car thief ? After all , all he did was take out after those kids who stole his sample case . He 's not just a car thief . What are you trying to tell me ? All I know is , I 'm responsible for that car . Look , Mr. Vincent , he 'll probably bring the car back . Maybe he already has , so the best ... Look , I 'm reporting a stolen car to you . It 's up to you to follow it through . Wait a minute , you trying to tell me my duties ? It looks as though somebody has to . All right . All right . Ernie , uh ... get a description of the car from Mr. Vincent . Put out a routine circulation . Look , time is very important . I got a whole town full of problems . What do you want from me ? Take care of him , Ernie . What are you planning to do ? Go back out there , I guess . Have to start somewhere . Well , uh ... mind if I tag along ? I-I could , uh , drive you out in my car . Well , the way I see it , there 's something funny on the fire , and I think maybe you got hold of the handle . May be . Uh ... what 's in that , uh , sample case ? Nothing good . ( grunts ) Man , this must be the hardest stuff in the world . Hal . What ? Hal , let 's take it back , huh ? You 're kidding . Look , maybe if we take it back they 'll just forget we took it . Maybe he 's right . You want him so much , take him . I 'm tired of playing wet nurse anyhow . MAVIS : Come on . He 's the one that 's got the job . He 's the one paying the rent . It 's just ' cause every time I get a good deal going , I got him around to foul it up . Do not . What about the time that guy offered us $ 200 a week just to do some crummy driving ? You blew the whistle . Yeah . Yeah , he wanted us to take stolen cars out of the state , and you call that a good deal ? ( drill buzzing ) I can 't get this thing open . Then let 's take it back . Well , we can 't just sit around here all day , huh ? Okay . What are you going to do ? You mean , what are you going to do ? You took something of mine . I don 't know what you mean , mister . JESSUP : I 'd like it back . I 'd like it back now . I got nothing of yours . What are you doing ? Well , where is it , I said ? Uh ... You want to die , son ? My brother . He 's got it . Where 's he ? I don 't know . I meant what I said about dying . I 'll just keep this key . I 'm surprised you didn 't toss her for the check . Your brother says you got my case . I got rid of it ! Where ? I threw it in the white convertible out front , the one with the black top . You 'd better not be lying , son . I never thought we couldn 't afford to go to sleep . Well , we have seven dollars . A day late and a dollar short . They 'll accept a credit card . Look , I 'm sorry about going to Vegas . I 'm sorry about losing the money . I 'm sorry about a lot of things , but what 's done is done . Now I 'm tired , and I have to get some sleep . Something will turn up . It always has . Not this time , Jack . You are tapped out financially and spiritually , and I 've had it . Whose is this thing ? It 's not ours . I never saw it before . Well , I told you something would turn up . Not to worry . Are we desperate enough to steal now ? No , but we 're desperate enough to accept a reward when we return it to the owner . ( grunts ) Anybody locks something up this tight , it 's either a woman or diamonds , and that doesn 't look like any woman I 've ever seen . Listen , go check us in . I 'm going to go see if I can find a chisel . Sure . You stole that suitcase and never even looked inside . We couldn 't get it open . I swear , we couldn 't get it open . You got a phone ? Frank , Ernie . A white convertible with a black top going south on 94 . Put out an APB for me , okay ? How long ago ? Who ? They 've already put out the call . Jessup phoned it in . Why 'd they send an ambulance ? He 's dead . Come on , let 's get out of here . Is it okay ? Come on . I almost got it . What 's your guess ? With your luck , dirty laundry . You know , the trouble with you , Sal , is you 've got no faith . Ew , it 's horrible . They must be worth something . What are they ? Some kind of seeds . Awful , disgusting seeds . Let 's get out of here . No , first let me find the owner . He 'll pay us something . I don 't want to wait . I never saw anything like this in my whole life , Sal . SAL : I want to go home and they 're not coming with me . Get rid of ' em , Jack . Please ? You 're forgetting we 're broke . We are flat broke . Now we can get a new start . We can win it all back , but you 've got to be patient . We can 't afford a motel room , and I should be patient so you can get another gambling stake ? Where are the keys ? All right . I 'm coming , too . Not with that ... box . You can get a plane when you 're rid of it . How ? Use your credit card . That autopsy is going to show that that boy died of a cerebral hemorrhage . How do you know that ? I 've seen it happen before . A kid that age . Tough . It 's worse than tough . He was murdered . You don 't like things to get too dull , do you ? Anytime it slows down , you feed me another zinger . Flying saucers , alien invaders . Now , wait just a minute . You saw two of them die this morning out there at that wreck . Okay . Looks like Jessup and your Lieutenant Mattson are friendly . What are you talking about ? Mattson . How much do you know about him ? That he comes with grade A references and has cut the mustard just fine around here for one solid year . Well , if I killed a man , I wouldn 't go to the police unless the lieutenant was a friend of mine . You 're crazy . We don 't know Jessup killed anyone . He just wanted help getting his suitcase back , that 's all . Ernie , I know how they work . They brought a saucer down around here because Mattson is one of them . He 's the one who told you not to send in your report . Now they 're together . It fits . Well , it 's been fun and all that , Vincent , but that 's it . Out . I know how it sounds . But trust me . Check on it . Out . I 'll risk my pension and all that , but I 'm not going to spend my declining years in a straightjacket . Move . If I wasn 't speeding and I didn 't go through a red light and if I say please , can I go now ? How long do I have to wait here ? ( tires squealing ) It won 't be long , ma 'am . You Mattson 's friend ? That 's right . She doesn 't have it with her . I 'm sorry to have , uh ... inconvenienced you this way , miss , but , uh ... I 'm missing a small suitcase and I was hoping you could help me get it back . I didn 't take it . Oh , nobody said you did , but I 'd be very grateful if you could point me to it . How grateful ? Well , say , uh ... $ 200 ? All right . $ 500 . For a bunch of funny-looking seeds ? You 've got a deal . What 's the matter ? Uh , nothing . Guess I 'm just tired . Anything new on that metal suitcase ? Uh , no . Listen , I think I 'll go next door and get a cup of coffee . You want a sandwich or something ? Oh , yeah , thanks . Roast beef on white . Operator . Operator , this is Sergeant Ernest Goldhaver . I 'd like to call the Philadelphia Police Department and bill the call to my home phone . Yes , sir . Your home phone number ? 623-1399 . Confirm tonight . Yes , sir . MAN : Police Department . Sergeant Mines . Uh , Sergeant , this is Sergeant Goldhaver , Phillipsburg , Colorado . Right . Well , I , uh , I 'm looking for someone who can tell me about a John Mattson . He used to work with you people . I knew him , Deputy . Good man . Well , uh ... what 's he doing now ? You didn 't hear ? I guess not . Hear what ? A couple of hophead kids ran him down last year . Judge called it manslaughter . We called it murder . I can get you his wife 's number if you want . No . I mean , thanks , Sergeant . Thanks very much . Forgot my wallet . Jack . Oh , Sal , thank heavens you 're back . You were right . No , I wasn 't . Sal , I got something to tell you ... . Just listen . No , you listen . It 's about the box . I found him , Jack- - the owner . I got rid of it . I threw it away ... SALLY : He 's giving us $ 500 for it . Threw it away ? Where ? Come on . Where are we taking it ? What do you usually do with seeds ? Are we going to plant them ? Where ? In the hothouse , dummy , where else ? I don 't think that 's such a good idea . It might be dangerous or something . Well , no one says you have to come . GIRL : Where are you going , Earl ? To the hothouse . Shut up , stupid . Can I come ? This is pretty dangerous work . Nitroglycerin and dynamite . So don 't tell anyone , Liz . Especially Mom . Okay . You want to blow us all to pieces ? Sorry , sir . It won 't happen again , sir . You run with a guy for a year , you think you know everything there is to know about him . John Mattson and I were tight . We were thick . I know the feeling . Now I really got a report to fill out . They 'll know I 'm back on the sauce . Maybe you 'd better countersign it . If we find that case before Jessup does , they 'll believe everything you say . I 'll almost drink to that . Delicious . Had your dinner yet , Mike ? Try one . You know what you can do . ( struggling grunts ) You guys are crazy . Get out of here , chicken . ( clucking ) Don 't worry . ( chuckling ) Nothing to it . The police report says that you had the case . If I still had it , Mr. Vincent I would have given it to that Mr. Jessup . At least he was offering coin of the realm . All right , when you threw the case away , was there anyone around ? No . Are you sure ? I told you- - nobody . Well , there was a couple of kids up the block . What kind of kids ? Kids kids- - boys . Probably freckle-faced . Who notices kids ? Thank you . You don 't mind too much , do you , honey ? What ? Oh , that I threw that case away- - blew the reward . I 'll tell you something . It 's the first time I knew you to toss in a winning hand . ( chuckles ) How do you want to handle this ? House by house by house . JESSUP : He didn 't call in ? He didn 't leave a message ? No , sir . It 's like he just disappeared . Is Lieutenant Mattson around ? Nope . What 's the trouble ? When do you expect him ? I don 't know . When he comes back , will you tell him I want to see him ? Some friends of mine have found something and I think it 's dangerous . What 'd they find , son ? I don 't know exactly . A metal case ? Yes , sir . I lost a suitcase . You didn 't say there was anything dangerous in it , Mr. Jessup . Well , there isn 't . It 's just seeds . Isn 't that right , son ? Yes , sir . And seeds aren 't dangerous , are they ? No , sir . We have a car outside . Why don 't you come with us ? Tell the lieutenant for me , will you ? Yeah . ( knocking on door ) Hello . Where 's your mama ? She 's not at home . What 's your name ? Elizabeth Garber . Do you have a brother ? What 's his name ? Earl Garber . And , uh , where is Earl , Elizabeth ? I 'm not telling and you can 't make me ! Elizabeth ... does your brother have a ... a case that looks like a suitcase ? Where did he take it ? It 's the uniform . I 'll wait outside . What does he have in that case ? Dynamite . Dynamite ? Well , he , uh ... he shouldn 't be playing with dynamite . Where is he ? The hophouse . What 's a hophouse ? For flowers . Oh , yes , I know what that is . Thank you . Everything 's okay . ( soft gurgling ) Look at them grow . Somebody 's going to walk in here and throw a fit . It ain 't gonna be me . Wait outside . You really panicked , huh ? JESSUP : Get them out of here ! You kids run ! I 'm all right . I 'm all right . ( glass breaking ) Wish you had another gun . I wish we had a bomb . If only we had an empty bottle . Only a full one . In the glove compartment . ( liquid trickling ) ( spores squealing ) ( spores squealing ) ( squealing continues ) I wish you hadn 't wasted the bottle that way , Vincent . That was good drinking whiskey . Well , it 's all there . You want to sign as a witness , it won 't hurt our case any . ( sighing ) : Ernie , don 't turn this in . Don 't ? Well , that 's a switch . How much longer do you have to wait for your pension ? A little over a year . Don 't take a chance on losing it . This is the big thing , David . You know , I like money as well as the next guy , but ... Ernie , chances are , they won 't believe you any more than they believe me . But you 're the one who told me . Let 's make a deal . In a year from now , when you have your pension if I 'm still working on this , we 'll get together . You and me- - that sounds good . Yeah , about that bottle in the glove compartment ... Forget it . I 've been lugging it around for a long time- - to fall back on . I mean , uh ... I wasn 't sure . Well , I 'm sure . One year and three months . Good enough . So long . So long , David . NARRATOR : The destruction of the alien spores becomes a major victory for David Vincent in a continuing relentless war in which victories are few .

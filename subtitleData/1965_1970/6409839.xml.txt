 [ theme music plays ] [ Baley 's voice ] Endless , curving corridors ... a city within a city ... and to think there was a time when buildings had windows . And above the buildings the sky , the sun and stars ... Forbidden Thoughts ! Less than a hundred years ago ... before we shut out the air , roofed over our cities , retired to our caves of steel ... protected , closed in isolation , safe . [ patriotic music plays ] [ recorded voice ] The Under-Secretary will receive you . Enter . [ Baley ] Plainclothesman Elijah Baley reporting . I haven 't been told the reason for being called to Washington , Under-Secretary . - [ Minnim ] Cigar ? - [ Baley ] No , thank you . [ Minnim ] How 's little old New York these days ? [ Baley ] Crowded as usual , Miss Under-Secretary . [ Minnim ] Sit down . Plainclothesman Baley . You are being temporarily reassigned . [ Baley ] Outside of New York ? [ Minnim ] Quite a distance . We are assigning you to temporary duty on Solaria . [ Baley ] That 's impossible ! No earthman has ever set foot on Solaria . [ Minnim ] An emergency . Heaven-sent , you might say . Solaria has had a murder . The first for two hundred years . [ Baley ] A little out of our jurisdiction , isn 't it ? [ Minnim ] They want a territorial detective assigned to the case . You were specifically asked for . Evidently they were impressed by the way you handled the murder of that spacer in Brooklyn ... [ Baley ] May I see the report ? [ Minnim ] No reports . You will be briefed on Solaria . [ Baley ] You expect me to go there cold , Under-Secretary ? [ Minnim ] This could be very important to us , Baley . You 'll appreciate there are 50 of these Outer Worlds , each maintaining a military potential 100 times greater than ours . By means of their positronic robot economies . Precisely . Now , what 's the major factor keeping us in this humiliating position ? I 'll tell you , Baley . Ignorance ! The Spacers know all about us . They send missions to Earth whenever they please . We stay cooped up in our covered Earth-cities , knowing only what they choose to tell us . Your position on Solaria will be unique , Baley . Unique . You mean I 'm to spy for Earth ? We should be grateful for any information gathered in the course of your assignment ... You realise , of course , that ... the atmospheric pressure alone might kill a man . A calculated risk . There 's the sun . I 'd have to face the sun . No doubt they 'll assign you to some special building . Under-Secretary , in any investigation one has to be mobile , move from place to place , risk constant exposure ... Their world is not enclosed . They have the sun ! And you have your orders . What do I pack ? A Solarian transport capsule leaves in half an hour . You 're on it , Baley . [ whirring ] Partner Elijah ! Daneel Olivaw . You on this case ? A team that worked so well in Brooklyn should not be broken up . Besides , I have some experience of your world , such as your aversion to open spaces . And I know nothing about Solaria . [ Olivaw ] Ask me . For a start , how big is it ? Solaria ? Nine thousand five hundred miles in diameter . Fertile areas - 30 million square miles . ln climate and atmosphere , resembling Earth . - Population ? - Twenty thousand . You mean 20 million , don 't you ? [ Olivaw ] Twenty thousand . Thirty million square miles for 20 thousand people ? Their expectation of life is not 90 years , partner . It is 350 ! Besides , they have the services of some 200 million positronic robots - Of course . You know that . - Oh , of course . [ whirring ] Is this thing convertible ? Can it be made to slide back ? It can . Then push it back . I want to try ... I want just a glimpse of the sky . I cannot allow that , partner . Daneel , if I arrive on Solaria with my Earth-agoraphobia intact , I 'll be at their mercy completely . I can 't be that vulnerable . I must prepare . You must arrive , partner . I 've got to test my resistance ... It 's probably no worse than a nightmare . For you , earthman ? - I have to do my job , Daneel . - So do I. The answer is no . You are not Daneel Olivaw , are you ? You know me . Your name is R. Daneel Olivaw . Robot Daneel Olivaw . I am here for your protection , partner . [ Baley ] Really ? Then why the disguise ? Close association with a robot would lower your status with the Solarians . If they believe me to be human , it will help with your investigations . Besides , I 'm not a Solarian robot , am I ? I have eyes . You will recall I was made on Aurora . I don 't care why you were made . I order you as a robot- - As a robot , my first duty is to protect you . First law of robotics . I order you to let me see the sky . I can endure it , I must for a short time . [ voice of RX-247 5 ] Contact ! Contact ! Contact ! We 're landing . We 're landing .

[ whirring ] [ Baley screaming ] Where am I ? ln the house specially built for you , Partner Elijah . - Built for me ? - On the Estate of Hannis Gruer , Head of Solarian security . Right . Let 's go and see Gruer . - How far is it ? - No travel is necessary . [ Gruer ] Welcome to Solaria , gentlemen . Are you comfortable ? [ Baley ] I 'm sorry . I wasn 't aware you had- - Do not apologise , earthman . I 'm Hannis Gruer . You may find our ways a little strange at first , earthman . I 'll have to take notes . You have the police report on this case ? Well , no ... - [ Baley ] No report . - No police . - What ? - There is no crime here . Therefore no occasion for police . Well , you appear to have a crime now . A murder . What was the victim 's name ? [ Gruer ] Rikaine Delmarre . - Profession ? - Foetologist . [ Baley ] Sorry . And I suppose the murderer is completely unknown ? [ Gruer ] Not at all . There is only one person who could have done the ... deed . [ Baley ] Then you have no problem . [ Gruer ] That person could not have done it either . I see ... Anyone around who could give me a first-hand account of the murder ? His wife . Mrs. Delmarre ... Any children ? [ silence ] Any children ? I must leave you now . At once . Our officials are at your disposal . The service robots have a list and will help you to make contact My deputy will assist you . Done viewing . What the hell ? [ Baley ] Where 's he gone ? [ Daneel ] He 's never been . What you saw was a trimensional image . You need a good night 's rest , partner . You can continue your investigations tomorrow ... How ? Like this ? By trimensional images ? It is the only way Solarians communicate with each other except in the most ... The most delicate circumstances . Then how am I supposed to investigate this case , Daneel ? I 've got to see these people . [ electronic whirring , bleeping ] Which of the officials on Gruer 's list do you wish to view , partner ? All of them . Let 's start with Mrs. Delmarre . [ robot ] Contact ... contact ... contact ... Denied . Let 's have the doctor ... Dr. Thool ... [ robot ] Contact ... contact ... contact ... Approved . - My name is Baley , sir . - [ Dr. Thool ] Yes . I 'm investigating the murder of Dr. Rikaine Delmarre ... Yes , I know . Welcome to Solaria , Mr. Baley . You 're dining . Perhaps I should come and see you after you 've finished . What ? See me ? This is monstrous ! Done viewing . [ Baley ] Wait a minute ! All right ! Try again ! [ robot ] Contact ... contact ... Deputy Head of Security Corwin Attlebish , master . Contact . [ Attlebish ] Good day to you , Mr. Baley . Look , with all due respect , Mr. Attlebish , how can I investigate this murder of yours strapped in a chair- - Strapped ? You are uncomfortable ? I was speaking figuratively . I have to make personal contact , Mr. Attlebish- - Our customs , Mr. Baley . Sure , but if you want me to clear up this mystery- - Mystery ? There is no mystery . Rikaine Delmarre was killed by his wife . We shall find out how and why ... You imply that I 'm not needed here , Mr. Attlebish ... You infer that . Well , try our Chief Sociologist , Anselmo Quemot . Done viewing , Mr. Baley . Quemot ? Quemot , did he say ? [ robot ] Anselmo Quemot . Contact ... Contact . [ Quemot ] Quemot , sociologist . I was expecting you to contact me . - How are you feeling Mr. Baley ? - Frustrated . Tell me Dr. Quemot ... You and Rikaine Delmarre , the murdered man . - You were friends ? - We were acquainted . [ Baley ] What sort of man was he ? A very wealthy man , devoted to Solaria . - An idealist ? - By definition . He volunteered for his job as Foetal Engineer . Sometimes to relax , he played chess with me . Oh , you saw one another . No , Baley . Even if I could stomach personal presence , Delmarre would have never allowed it . His delicate job did not count his sensibilities . He was extremely finicky . And Mrs. Delmarre , you know her also ? We 've viewed one another . A perceptive mind . Would she be capable of killing her husband ? She was the only one close enough to Rikaine to kill him , to be sure . He was too finicky to see anyone else . Almost as finicky as Dr. Leebig . Leebig ? The roboticist ? He 's on my list of contacts ... [ robot ] Contact Dr. Leebig , master ? [ Dr. Quemot ] Do contact him by all means . You may find him a rather difficult character . I have another viewing contact waiting . Good day to you , Baley . Done viewing . [ Dr. Leebig ] Yes ? Are you one of the earthmen ? Why do you presume to disturb me at work ? It 's my job , Doctor Leebig . As a roboticist , were you a close associate of the murdered man ? Yes , but you are here against my advice . Done viewing ! Don 't break contact , please . Could I come and see you , Dr. Leebig ? No earthman vulgarity , please ! If you as much as tried to invade my estate ... What would you do ? Kill me ? Do you usually make such threats , Dr. Leebig ? I make no threats . My studies in robotics can be of little use to you . - You have no knowledge ... - Then teach me , Dr. Leebig . [ robot ] Contact established , master . Contact . - What ? Which monitor ? - In the rest room , master ! Done viewing , I say ! Done viewing ! Delayed contact ! Mrs. Delmarre , master . [ clattering , electronic bleeping ] [ hissing ] Hello , Mr Baley . Sorry to have kept you waiting . Hannis Gruer told me you 'd be wanting to view . You 're from Earth , I understand . It might be better , Mrs. Delmarre , if you were to put on some articles of clothing . Why ? You don 't think I 'd let you see me ... [ Baley I am seeing you . You 're viewing me , Mr. Baley . - What is your first name ? - Elijah . And you ? Gladia . [ hissing stops ] - Shall we proceed ? - Sure . - How long were you married ? - Ten years . - Happily ? - How do you mean ? Well , you saw one another constantly , so- - I should hope not ! We 're not animals , you know . Tell me , did you actually witness the murder ? He came to me that day , because it was the assigned day for ... for seeing . We spoke for a while and then he left to return to his work . About 15 minutes later , I heard a shout . I 'd never heard him shout before . What did you do ? I ran ... to his laboratory . I found him . Dead . - He was alone ? - Of course . My husband was very strict . He never saw anybody . But somebody had killed him . So someone had seen him . How many more times ? We Solarians don 't go around seeing each other . We 're not like you earthmen . A Solarian who would commit a murder , wouldn 't mind doing a bit of seeing , now , would he ? Oh , you don 't understand at all ! His head was all ... bloody . I called a robot , and he alerted the others , and they took care of me . And the body ? Burned like any dead body . Tell me , Gladia , have you any images of your husband ? You mean a painting ? A photograph ? No , no . Something more . A record , electronic visual , anything ... Well , I have a film recording a scheduled assignment . It 's quite usual , but nobody would ever view it except me or my husband . Your husband is dead , Gladia . I need to view that film . I want to ask you a question . Go ahead . That ... That person with you ... Daneel ? You two , at this moment ... You aren 't viewing ... I mean each other . - You 're doing the other thing . - We 're here together . - You could ... touch him . - Right . How absolutely disgusting . Gladia , did you kill your husband ? Done viewing . You will show me that film , Gladia . I 'm breaking contact . Done viewing . Done viewing ! [ high-pitched electronic whirring ] [ Baley groans ] You seem upset , Mr. Baley . [ Olivaw ] Plainclothesman Baley is feeling the effects of open spaces ... [ staggering ] I must try to continue this investigation . [ exhales , sighs ] [ Baley ] What confuses me is the absence of a weapon ... The weapon used to kill Mr. Delmarre . [ Gruer ] We have not been able to locate it . Robots searched for it under my viewing supervision . ln vain . Could it have been removed by Gladia Delmarre ? When the robots arrived , she was on the floor , unconscious - [ Baley ] Could the robots have removed it from the scene of the crime ? [ Gruer ] The robots touched nothing . But they removed the body ! A robot was found on the scene of the crime ! It was completely disordered . [ Baley ] Where is it now ? Scrapped ? [ Gruer ] We have no use for faulty robots . I don 't understand you ! The only evidence you had you destroyed ! Why ? Would you mind asking your associate to leave the room ? What ? [ to robot ] Water , please . I understand . Call me if you need me , partner . Listen ! There 's something more to this murder . Much more ! There are parties on Solaria , secret organisations ... Dr. Delmarre was a traditionalist . There are new forces among us , forces for change . Delmarre has been ... silenced ! [ Baley ] By whom ? His wife ? There is an organisation I tell you . Delmarre was on the track of something ... He told me before he died . The whole human race may be in danger . And is that why you asked for my help ? There are too few of us here , earthman . I haven 't dared speak to anyone . I do not know who is involved in the conspiracy ... Not a word to Mr. Olivaw . And when you speak to Corwin Attlebish ... [ Gruer ] Oh , no . No ! Burning . Burning ! Robots ! Robots ! Your master has been poisoned ! Contact ! Contact ! Contact ... contact ... Hannis Gruer 's household robot . Will your master live ? [ household robot ] The doctor is attending him ... All right . Now get me Dr. Thool ! [ robot ] Contact ! Contact ! Ah , good . How is your patient , Doctor ? - He may not survive . - What was the poison ? I 'm afraid I don ' t know . I cannot recall a poisoning case in 200 years ' practice . Well , test the reservoir tap ! How could I do that ? - We have no experience ... - Jumping Jehoshaphat ! Take an animal with you . Inject some of reservoir water into its veins . Use your intelligence man ! Do something ! - Test the water in the pitcher ! - What pitcher ? The pitcher from which Gruer poured the poisoned drink ! Well , dear me . I presume that it has all been cleared away ! The household robots would not be likely to leave it standing about . What ? The moment we produce an item of evidence , some damn robot destroys it ! We cannot interfere with a robot 's task orders without a thorough programme of re-scheduling . Oh ! Done viewing ! Done viewing , I say ! I want to view Gladia Delmarre ! Done viewing ! Contact ! Contact ! Hello , Elijah ! I didn 't mean to interrupt you ... I have decided to let you view that film . - Thank you . - And afterwards ... Yes ? I suggest you join me for dinner . I 'm quite properly dressed this time . Join you ... you mean come over to your place ? [ Gladia laughs ] You , earthman , have a one-track mind ! What I meant , of course , was that you order dinner in your room . Then you get your robots to join our trimensional images . And then we eat . All right , Elijah ? All right . But first the film . [ robot ] Contact ! Contact ! [ robot ] Mr. Delmarre arriving for scheduled personal presence . I have made the room darker , Rikaine . Last time you complained . It has been an unusually hard quarter . I have taken to sleeping upon an inflated pillow . It rests my back . My household robots have been given the requisite instructions . I will give the instructions , Rikaine . Do you wish to view a book-film ? It would make you feel more comfortable . I am as comfortable as can be expected . No book-film . I have my thought-selector ... From our last viewing , it would appear that you look well , Rikaine . I find this ordeal even more daunting if one has to talk . To one 's wife ? It is only a matter of time . Solaria will be the first world to abolish completely this primitivism ... Animal primitivism of scheduled seeing ... We don 't have to ... We 're not scheduled . I mean there 's no need to ... Really ? Rikaine , I hope you don 't mind , We are so rarely scheduled for for visiting ... I have taken the liberty of recording a presence film - just for me . - What ? Now ? You are having a schedule filmed ? Oh , Rikaine ! Why not ? Just for me when I 'm alone ... Your vulgarity takes my breath away . It 's unbelievable ! Robots ! Robots ! Dismantle . [ glass clinks ] About the poisoning , Gladia ... Poisoning . Maybe it wasn 't ... poison . Oh ? There was nobody in his presence ... How do you know ? There couldn 't have been . Hannis Gruer hasn 't got a wife since he 's completed his quota of ... I 'm sorry , I can 't say that word . So , he must have done it himself . Are you enjoying the vegetables ? - I viewed it , Gladia . - Then you know who did it . The same one who killed your husband , obviously . Gruer , as we say where I come from , knew too much . Yes . Yes , the vegetables are fine . Then it couldn 't have been me , could it ? That 's why you wanted to join me , isn 't it ? To find out ... Well , I 've never been near Gruer 's estate in my life ... Never ... Never in my life ! Gladia ! Aren 't you holding your knife rather tightly ? Break contact ! Done viewing ! What news of Hannis Gruer , Mr. Attlebish ? He has been vomiting a great deal , but he will live . Is that all , earthman ? No , that 's not all . Your poisoners on Solaria seem to lack practical experience . They gave Gruer too much and he threw it up . Poisoners ? There is no evidence for poison , according to Dr. Thool . Dr. Thool ! Your doctors don 't know any more than your detectives . I 've never seen such an incompetent- - If you wish to leave Solaria , feel free to do so . Not till I 've completed my assignment . We hired you , earthman . We can , therefore , also discharge you . I order you to return to your home planet . If you kick me out , Mr. Attlebish , the next delegation to arrive in Solaria will come in warships ! I 'm from Earth , and that 's the system ! You insult us , we send warships . Got it ? Done viewing . Right . That does it . Done viewing . From now on , anybody I talk to on this god-forsaken planet , I 'm going to see in the flesh ! Are you all right ? That could be very dangerous , partner . [ Baley ] I 'll survive . I 've stood it so far . I 'm not referring to atmospheric dangers . Hannis Gruer , the key Solarian figure in the investigation of this murder , has been poisoned . Does it not follow that if you expose yourself indiscriminately , you might be the next victim ? My first duty is to protect you , partner . Even from yourself . How will you stop me , robot ? This is an interim report by Plainclothesman Baley on my investigation into the murder of Solarian , Rikaine Delmarre . The following Solarians have been interviewed : Dr. Thool , Dr. Quemot , Corwin Attlebish , and the next step ... Yes ? Have you contacted the roboticist ? Dr. Leebig directs you to call tomorrow . He is engaged on important work . - You tell Dr. Leebig . - I have no contact , master . All right , tell his contact robot that I 'm here by invitation of the Solarian authorities , I 'm getting no cooperation at all , and if I 'm not viewing him in five minutes , I 'll be over at his estate seeing him within the hour . Use the word ! I 'll see him ! The other contact is waiting , master . What ? Hello . I wanted to apologise for losing my temper last time we viewed . That 's all right , Gladia . I 'm going to see you in a few hours ... No , please ... Gladia , your chief robotist , Dr. Jothan Leebig . Do you know him ? Of course . My husband was very interested in robotics . Jothan and I often used to go for walks together . - For walks ? - Viewing , of course . Did your husband order Dr. Leebig to stop paying attention to you ? What an extraordinary question . Well , did he ? You don 't understand at all . I 've got to see you , Gladia . Is it absolutely necessary ? Absolutely . Contact with Dr. Leebig ! Excuse me . This is really most regrettable . - I told you last time ... - Just listen to me , Leebig ! It is my belief that throughout the history of the positronic robot , the laws of robotics have been deliberately misquoted . What are you talking about ? To hide the truth that robots can commit murder , Dr. Leebig ! Really ? ln Solaria , Mr. Baley , distrust of the robot is regarded as a disease . Then let 's meet face to face and I 'll produce evidence ! Seeing is impossible ! Others are seeing me ... and so will you ! Daneel ! No ! I can 't ... I mustn 't . [ Leebig sobbing ] - [ Olivaw ] Yes , partner ? - [ Baley ] Look at him . [ Leebig panting ] [ Olivaw ] He 's regressing ! [ Baley ] He 's regressing to a five-year-old so that it will be legitimate for him to see me ! Protect yourself , Leebig . - I 'm coming over . - No seeing ! No seeing ! I 'll break contact ! Then answer my questions right now . What do you want to know ? Just this : If a man says to a robot , " Place this liquid into a glass of water . Afterwards , forget you 've done it . " Won 't the robot do as he 's told ? Yes ... And if the robot hands this water to a man and the man drinks it and dies- - The robot would be innocent . The man would be the murderer , but no man would give such orders . I 'm trying to prove that , despite your robotic laws , a robot could be the instrument of murder . Nonsense ! The laws are devised to protect us . What are your feelings towards Gladia Delmarre , Dr. Leebig ? I understand , you went for walks together . What did you talk about ? Robotics . She 's a good listener . Did you find her pleasant ... physically attractive ... ? I really can 't answer these questions . - They 're filthy . - All right . Why did you stop walking with her ? Did she stop being a good listener ? We ran out of things to say . Then you no longer find her pleasant . But you know her very well , don 't you ? What could her motive be ? Not oven a Solarian could commit a murder without a motive ... There was a motive . She told me frequently that she quarrelled with her husband . Bitterly and frequently . Didn 't she tell you , earthman ? She hated her husband ! Hated him ! May I come closer , Gladia ? Not ... Not too close . Can you stand the sun ? It 's very low in the sky . Shall we walk ? We have some flowerbeds you might like . I 've never walked with anyone before ... seeing . When you walked with Dr. Leebig , were you dressed like this ? It depended on weather . Sometimes like this , sometimes more lightly . I believe , he tried to teach you robotics ? He never gave up . When I didn 't understand , he 'd scold me . If we were anywhere near the lake I 'd jump in and splash him ! I thought you were viewing ! Of course . The water couldn 't touch him , but he 'd duck just the same . Am I too close to you ? I 'm getting used to it . This is a native plant . Most of the flowers here are from Earth originally . - [ Baley ] You 've killed it . - [ Gladia ] I picked it . Are you saying that because I pick a flower , I could kill my husband ? [ Baley ] It smells like a woman 's perfume . [ Gladia ] And every woman smells different . Sometimes I try to imagine it . Crowds and crowds of people all ... - All ... - Seeing each other ? [ Baley ] Have you ever viewed scenes on Earth , say , in a film ? [ Gladia ] It 's different in a film . It just seems like a multi-view . [ Baley ] Do people kiss in Solarian films ? - I don 't view that kind . - Never ? Well , there are always a few dirty films going the rounds ... It 's sickening really . [ Baley ] Why did you tell Dr. Leebig about your quarrels with your husband ? I understand you hated him . I thought you wanted to be a friend . I was wrong . You are a detective . Your husband was not a very affectionate man , was he , Gladia ? You , on the other hand , are affectionate . Aren 't you ? It 's disgusting to talk about it ! But you talked about it to Dr. Leebig . Your husband was cold and unloving , and you resented it . Your film proved conclusively . Nothing of the kind . Rikaine was a good Solarian and we ... We weren 't scheduled for ... For ... Did you kill him , Gladia ? We were quarrelling at the time ... the time he died ... I suppose I screamed at him , lost my temper . I was so angry ... I don 't remember ... - Don 't remember what ? - What ? He was dead and I was screaming and then the robots ... Oh , help me , Elijah . Help me . The sun is so red . So red . [ prolonged high-pitched tone ] I want ... I want to help ... Are you sick ? I thought I could stand it if I experienced it gradually in easy stages . [ Gladia ] What do you want me to do , Elijah ? [ Baley ] I must get back inside . Try ... Try a little longer . What are you trying to do ? You know it 's not possible to bear it for long ... - [ Gladia ] Close your eyes ... - [ Baley ] No ... I can 't stand it . I can 't ! Why am I here ? Over-exposure . [ sighs ] The red sun ... You should not venture into the open without me , partner . I am here to protect you , remember ? - Where is Mrs. Delmarre ? - Under house arrest . - By whose order ? - By mine . I can 't be sure . She had the opportunity more than she admitted . She did not rush to the scene when she heard her husband scream . She was there all along . but I can 't be sure . They all refuse to see you ... or if they did , they took the most extravagant precautions . Mrs. Delmarre , on the other hand ... Perhaps she has a strong interest in the opposite sex . And Dr. Delmarre was not the type to encourage such interest , was he ? He would regard it as psychotic . It must have been very frustrating for her . Frustrating enough to commit murder in a moment of passion . ln that case , she would also have attempted the murder of Gruer . And the murder of yourself , partner . Did she suggest the meeting at sunset ? I think I know , Daneel . Contact , master ! Contact ! Earth contacting ! - Earth ? - Yes . Under-Secretary Minnim . [ prolonged high-pitched tone ] Contact approved . [ Minnim over radio ] Plainclothesman Baley , You 're ordered back . You 're ordered back at once . I can 't , I haven 't finished . I personally order your return . All arrangements are made . I can 't leave now ... There will be serious consequences if you disobey . - I myself ... - Break contact ! Contact broken , master . You can 't defy the Under-Secretary . I have done so , Daneel . Where were we ? You haven 't even found the weapon , partner . - How can you- - ? - I want you to call a meeting , with all the suspects on our list . If you know , you are in very great danger , partner . From whom , Daneel ? From whom ? Contact Gladia Delmarre ! Contact Mr. Attlebish ! [ humming , bleeping ] Contact Dr. Leebig ! Contact Dr. Thool ! Contact Dr. Quemot ! Contact ... Contact . This is no good ! I said all together ! - You didn 't think you could ... - See them ? They 'd regard that as a 20th century orgy . I want their images frozen together . - What do they call it ? - A multi-view ? I 'll instruct the robot . [ robot ] Contact . Contact for multi-view . And you know what else I want you to do , Daneel . Yes , partner , I do . The question remains ... was Gladia the only one with a motive for killing Dr. Delmarre ? According to Dr. Leebig , she and her husband quarrelled frequently . ln fact , I believe that Dr. Leebig himself was on the point of breaking off relations with both Doctor and Mrs. Delmarre- - False ! I shall break off contact , earthman . Let him continue . As for you , Dr. Quemot , it seems that Dr. Delmarre 's death left you conveniently in absolute charge of Solarian population control . You judge by the moral standards of Earth , Mr. Baley . All I 'm saying is , motive alone won 't get us very far . Any of you could have wanted Dr. Delmarre dead ... Prove it ! One point on which you all agree is that Dr. Delmarre was a good Solarian . A primitive island poet once wrote " He is all fault who has no fault at all . " A glass of water , please . Dr. Delmarre was on the point of discovering a conspiracy on Solaria ... A conspiracy that was preparing an assault on the rest of the galaxy for ... Thank you . ... for purposes of conquest . He wanted to prevent that . - [ Leebig ] Rubbish ! - [ Attlebish ] Proof ! Surely , we must concentrate on the question of opportunity . Who could have been close enough to Delmarre- - Nonsense ! You know very well that Dr. Delmarre would never tolerate personal presence ! [ Baley ] If he were aware that personal presence was involved . I don 't follow , I 'm afraid . [ Baley ] When I first viewed Gruer , I imagined he was in my presence . When you treated Mrs. Delmarre at the scene of the crime , she initially assumed you were viewing her , didn 't she , Dr. Thool ? These theories are all Earth-orientated , and , therefore , quite useless . You have not even discovered the murder weapon , have you , earthman ? Dr. Thool had the opportunity of removing the weapon . I removed nothing . I swear it ! All right . But the victim and the unconscious wife were not only individuals on the scene , were they ? There was also a disorganised robot . Well ? What logically follows if you all speak the truth ? The murder weapon was in that robot ! [ Leebig ] Robots don 't kill ! [ Thool ] The first reaction law of robotics ! [ Leebig ] ln any case , how could anyone arrange to have a robot smash a man 's skull ? Shall I explain how , Dr. Leebig ? Do you really want me to ? Go ahead ! Robot , give me your arm , will you ? - My arm , master ? - Yes . Daneel ... [ crashing ] No matter what spectacles you provide for us , earthman , everything still points to her ! [ Baley ] Does it ? But Mrs. Delmarre knows nothing about handling robots , - does she , Dr Leebig ? - Not exactly . [ Baley ] ln fact , you tried to teach her robotics ! She was completely hopeless , wasn 't she ? [ Leebig ] She might have pretended ignorance- - [ Baley ] Oh , come now . As a roboticist , are you prepared to say that Mrs Delmarre was sufficiently skilled to drive robots to indirect murder ? [ Quemot ] Are you saying someone else would have the skill ? [ Baley ] I am . Dr. Jothan Leebig , self-admittedly the best roboticist on Solaria ! [ Leebig ] I studied the Delmarre robot after the murder ! He had no detachable limbs . There are dozens of different models in use ... [ Baley ] But you disposed of the robot pretty quickly , didn 't you ? [ Leebig ] I 've told you before ! It was disorganised , useless ! It had witnessed a murder . [ Baley ] Perhaps we could ask Mr. Attlebish to check if any robots with detachable limbs were at any time available to Dr. Delmarre ... [ Leebig ] No ! My records are not to be tampered with ! Done viewing ! [ Baley ] Why " Done Viewing " if you have nothing to hide ? [ Baley ] Re-contact ! Re-contact ! [ robot ] Cannot contact for multi-view . [ Baley ] All right , get him alone on one of the scanners ! Quickly . [ robot ] Try contact ! Contact ! [ robot ] Contact ! Contact ! [ Leebig ] I 'm sick and tired of these insinuations ! Why should I want to dispose of Delmarre ? Why ? Motive , earthman ? [ Baley ] You were very friendly with his wife , weren 't you ? I know you didn 't consort with women , but even a Solarian roboticist may fall victim to certain urges ... [ Leebig ] Stop this filth ! [ Baley ] Perhaps you didn 't recognise your own feelings ! Maybe you hated Mrs. Delmarre for inspiring them , and her husband for , well , being her husband . By killing Dr. Delmarre in such a way as to throw suspicion on Mrs. Delmarre , you could be avenged of both at once ! [ Leebig ] Filth ! An earthman maybe ! Never a Solarian ! [ Baley ] You also had a second motive , didn 't you , Leebig ? Dr. Delmarre stood in the way of certain plans ... Robots , contact Deputy Head of Security , Attlebish ! [ robot ] Contact ! Contact ! [ Leebig ] Plans ? What plans ? [ Baley ] The conquest of the galaxy ! [ Leebig ] Madness ! This earthman is insane ! [ Baley ] Listen , Leebig ! My partner is on his way now , to examine your records ! [ Leebig ] What ? Your colleague 's invading my estate ? Personal human presence ! [ Baley ] We only wish to see your records . They will establish ... [ Attlebish ] ln order that these accusations may be finally disproved , I order the examination of Dr. Leebig 's records to take place ! [ Baley ] Robot , contact all the others ! Quickly ! [ Leebig ] I won 't ... I refuse to ... see anyone in person . Why do you want to torture me ? All right ! I 'll tell you . Delmarre 's robot had detachable limbs ! And I could have arranged Gruer 's poisoning ! The poisoned arrow could have been placed into the hands of the robot . I say yes to anything , only , please ... Keep the human away from me ! Don 't let him come . No personal contact ! Please ! Please don ' t let him come ! I can 't bear seeing , can 't bear it . I ... can 't bear it . You fool , it 's only a robot ! Partner Elijah , the human is dead . [ rustling ] [ Baley ] I 'm seeing you ? [ Gladia ] How can you tell ? You 're wearing gloves . You don 't mind ? Why have you decided to see me ? I have to get used to it if I 'm going to Aurora . Through Daneel ? It 's arranged ? He seems to have influence ... I 'm still frightened . You 'll forget , Gladia . I don 't want to . Not everything ... And you 'll marry again . That , forgive me , is not the most attractive prospect for me , Elijah . You have to go back , now ? The Under-Secretary is more determined than I thought . Elijah ... It 's all true , you know , I mean about Jothan Leebig ... I know . Other roboticists have been over his records . They found experiments for the purpose of constructing unmanned , intelligent spaceships . They also found robots ... with replaceable limbs . Don 't talk about it anymore . Why not ? You were close to Leebig . Yet he was genuinely terrified of people . He was prepared to destroy other worlds ... just to make sure that Solaria 's taboos on personal presence could not be assailed . He also killed himself to avoid personal presence ... When it can be so ... When it can be so ... I 'll never see you again , will I ? Listen , Gladia . ln 40 years I 'll be dead or at best a wizened old man . You 'll look pretty much as you do now ... [ Gladia ] May I ... May I touch you ? [ Baley ] Be careful , Gladia .. [ Gladia ] I 'm not afraid . Your hand . [ Minnim ] You didn 't do a bad job , Plainclothesman , as a detective . [ Baley ] Thank you . I 'm sorry you had to go to all this trouble to make sure of my return to Earth . [ Minnim ] You had another assignment . [ Baley ] I believe I have recognised the weakness of the Solarians . [ Minnim ] Indeed ? They 've done away with something that mankind has known for a million years . Co-operation between individuals . Only one science flourishes in Solaria , robotics . That one science could mean the end of our world . If applied to conquest by men like Leebig . Did you intend him to commit suicide ? I intended to force a confession . He was a dangerous man ... Whose work could have been vital if made available to us , Baley . Didn 't you ever stop to consider your own position if the Solarians had realised that ... Realised what ? That Leebig couldn 't possibly have murdered Rikaine Delmarre ! Who did kill Delmarre , Baley ? If you mean who struck the actual blow ... [ Minnim ] Yes of course that 's what I mean . [ Baley ] It was Gladia . And you let her go to Aurora ? Leebig wanted Delmarre dead , and Gladia incriminated . So he supplied Delmarre with a robot , and programmed it to hand Gladia one of its detachable limbs during an argument with her husband . At the height of her rage . Morally , she was no more responsible than the robot . I 'm not concerned with one murder , Baley . I 'm concerned with the future of our planet . So am I. That 's why I have to go back to Solaria , Under-Secretary . If you study Solarian society carefully you will see it 's modelled closely and directly on Earth itself ! They 've progressed more rapidly than we have , that 's all . But we 're bound to end up the same way unless we change . Not our department , Baley . You 're a policeman not a sociologist . [ shuffling ] - What do you think you 're doing ? - I 'm going to let in the sun ... [ Minnim ] Have you gone insane ? Sit down at once ! Robots ! [ Baley ] Before it 's too late ! We 've got to learn to face the sun . Robots ! Help ! [ Baley ] The sun ... [ Minnim ] Robots ! [ whirring ] Robots !

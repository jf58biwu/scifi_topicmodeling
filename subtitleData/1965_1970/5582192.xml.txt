 Sluit uw veiligheidsgordel aub . Senator Clark . We gaan landen . Mobiel Tic-Toc 1 voor Tic-Toc Basis . Verzoek toegang . Code : Red Lion . Tic-Toc Basis Voor Mobiel Tic-Toc 1 , toegang toegestaan , - Dr. Phillips . - Jiggs . Dit is Senator Clark . Dit is sergant Jiggs . De laadstrook van onze veiligheids troepen . Een plezier u te ontmoeten . Senator . - Geef maar aan mij. aub . - Veiligheid . Senator . Senator . Er zijn meer dan 12,000 personen ondergebracht in elk van deze gebouwen , Elk gebouw telt meer dan 800 verdiepingen . You know . Phillips. every time I check your budget figures ... I ask myself the same question - Is time travel really worth all this ? Senator. the control of time ... is potentially the most valuable treasure that man will ever find . Well. its certainly the most costly . Will you come with me. please ? Senator . Hang on . Were going into free fall for 800 floors . Theres much more to see below . Itll be over in a few seconds . Senator . - An old friend of yours . I believe . - Leroy . - Hello . Leroy . - Woody . My. its been a long time . How did they ever get an old dogface like you out of the mud ? Huh . Worst paratroop officer I ever commanded . I told him to go into politics . where he couldnt hurt anyone . Come on . That was meant to be a gag. not a dig . Now whats all this investigation nonsense ? Well . I think you can guess why Im here . Woody . Of course . Come over here a minute . Did you ever see anything like this before in your life ? No . I cant say that I have . Thats what Imm here to talKabout , General . I think Tony ought to be in on this . - Where is he ? - In the Tunnel . This way . So thats the monster thatss cost us all this money. hmm ? Yes . Senator . Well . Leroy. what do you think ? - Pretty expensive toy . - Toy ? Hardly a toy . Senator . According to your reports ... all youve ever sent back in time are mice and monkeys . - So far. yes . - How do you know they werent just disintegrated ? Disintegration would cause some residue in matter . Have you ever returned these animals to this laboratory safe and sound ? - Not yet. no . But - - Then so far as we Know ... this whole thing might be just a fancy disappearing act . - Isnt that true ? - Actually. at this point - Youre guessing , Doctor , and , so far ... your guessing has cost the United States government 71 / 2 billion dollars . This way . Senator . Tommy ! Could you come out here a minute ? Doug . Its gonna work . I just finished the polarization . and it just feels right . - Take a look . - Senator Leroy Clark. this is Dr. Anthony Newman . - Excuse me . Senator . - Doctor ? You seem a little young for that title ... not to mention being number two man on this project . His youth is only a disguise . Senator . Inside is an old genius struggling to get out . Im glad you were interested enough in our project to pay us a personal call . Senator . Lets just say I dontt like to scrap billions of dollars by just sending a memo . - Scrap ? - Tony . The senator feels our experiments havent shown enough success ... to warrant the time and money invested . - But were so close now . - Close to what. son ? To sending a man back in time and returning him. of course . Well. then do it . No more promises. boys . I want a fact I can grab hold of . - By when ? - When ? You and the general have been on this for 10 years . Youve been with the project almost seven , I say the time is now , You mean today ? Thats right. because tomorrow afternoon Imm flying back to Washington ... to write you a blank check ... or cut your umbilical cord . Leroy . We are not ready to risk a life . Doug . Let me try it . Absolutely not . We just give up . Is that it ? Weve put our lives into this project . Im not going to commit murder ... and Im not going to allow you to commit suicide just to satisfy a budget . Thats no answer . Thatss not even science . Excuse me . He seems a little emotional for a scientist . Anything else you want to show me ? - Plenty . - Leroy. we havent even begun . Senator . This is a red alert ! Red alert ! All Time Tunnel personnel report to their stations on the double ! Its Tony . - Cant you stop him ? - Not now . Hedd burn alive . - George. start the countdown . - Sixteen , 15 ... 14 , 13 ... - 12 , 11 , 10 - - Whats happening to him ? Hes in a radiation freeze . Its the first step in his relocation . - ... four , three , two ... - Pray that it works . one , zero , ! All right . Start location probe . Jerry. see if you can synchronize the time curve . Ray. give us a power-and-distance ratio . - Ann. find what specific radiation Tony is . - Ill try . Well. where is he ? He could be living in yesterday or next week or a million years from now . - How do you know ? - Youve got your guinea pig . Sen - - Doug ! - Take a sock at me if itll make you feel any better . But Id still like to know whatss going on . Tony just finished developing that radiation bath . That was the blue mist you saw just before he disappeared , In theory. this should give us a magnetic fix - like a homing device - to enable us to locate him in time . In theory . What if it doesnt work ? Then hell be lost in time for the rest of his life . - Are you hurt ? - Ive made it . Hmm ? You are hurt . Ill call someone . Oh. no. no . Im - Imm fine . Really . But you had a very bad fall . I. uh - I didnt look where I was going . Its a pretty big ship . Its supposed to be the biggest ever built . It doesnt look so big in the middle of all this water. does it ? Are you. uh - You are American. arent you ? - Huh ? - Are you American ? Oh - Oh. please . Why dont you sit down ? Oh. yes. uh - Yes . I am . - Anthony Newman . - Althea Hall . Do all Americans adopt the vigorous life ... just to please your Teddy Roosevelt ? - Teddy ? - Mr. Roosevelt . Oh. no . I guess I should have put on a jacket . I didnt think it would be so cold . Then youve never spent April in London . I do hope itll be warmer when we reach New York . Is that where - That is. are you making your first trip to New York ? As a matter of fact . I am . Does it show ? Oh. no . No. of course not . I - I just wondered . Not that Im one of those Europeans who think there are still. uh ... cowboys and Indians in New York . But it is the other side of the world. isnt it ? - That depends on which side you start from . - Touch√© . I havent noticed you in the dining room the past three days . Are you a man of mystery . Mr. Newman ? Ive. uh. been eating in my cabin - catching up on some work . Well. its bad luck to work on Saturday nights ... particularly when its the 13th . - Saturday . April 13 . - Are you superstitious ? Oh , no , No , Ive ... just been working so much ... Ive lost all track of time . Well . I think I ... better get that jacket . See you again , Miss Hall , Titanic ? - Any luck ? - No. not yet . Doug. weve collated the automatic settings that Tony used . The energy he employed could not have sent him more than a hundred years ... forward or back in time - probably less . - Ann. reduce your limits . - Only a hundred years forward or back , That means you have to pinpoint him across 200 years . 200 years is just a heartbeat ... compared to the countless billions of years of time . Yes . I suppose so . Well. what happens if you find him ? Tony and his immediate environment will be relayed into the Tunnels recorders ... and reproduced instantly on the image area . and reproduced instantly on the image area . - You mean well be able to see him ? - See and hear him . - Would he be able to see us ? - No. but hell know what werre trying to do . He might communicate with us on the assumption that weve found him . - Ray . - I Know , Doc , Im beginning to get some irregular coordination . Sounds like bells . - Captain . - Good afternoon . Captain . I must speak to you . Its very important . Yes. of course . Youre. uh-Yourre Mr. - My name is Newman. sir . but that doesnt matter . Captain . I must tell you something . Yes. of course . Mr. Newman . What did you want to say ? I dont know how to say it without sounding like Imm out of my mind . Come. come. my dear fellow . Youre dissatisfied with your accommodations ... or the food or - or perhaps youve misplaced something and yourre afraid itsss been stolen . - In any case . I assure you - - Captain. this ship is the Titanic , Is that what you had to tell me ? What I mean. sir . is the Titanic sank . It struck an iceberg and was lost . Sank ? This is our maiden voyage. sir . That means our first voyage . I trust this is not some poor attempt at a practical joke . No . Captain. its not a joke . I swear to you . How can I make you understand ? Perhaps if you stopped talking nonsense . Mr. Newman . Newman . Newman . I dont recall . Are you in second class or third ? Im not on the passenger list . Captain . Im Dr. Anthony Newman . My doctoratess in electro-physics . Its a very impressive title . Doctor . Listen . I know I sound insane . but you must believe me - for the sake of thousands of lives . I cant remember the exact hour and day of the disaster. but itss history . Stop this rubbish . We are riding on a calm sea . You talk about sinkings and disasters as though theyd already happened . It has for me . Captain . I was born in 1938 . - If you insist . - Captain . Im part of a scientific team in the year 1968 . Weve been experimenting with time displacement . Ive been sent back in time to this ship - to this moment. month and year . Mr. Grainger. this gentleman is a confessed stowaway . Please see that hes confined till we reach New York . Captain. youll never reach New York . Im afraid his peculiar ideas might alarm some of the other passengers . I suggest you keep him incommunicado and under guard . Yes. sir . Even if you dont believe me. it wouldntt hurt you to change your course . - Go farther south . - Take him below . Captain . Not reach New York ? Change our course ? What sort of gibberish was that. sir ? I make him some sort of harmless crank . Mr. Grainger . But there are other transatlantic lines ... which would not like to see us set a record on our maiden run . I cant believe theydd go to these lengths. but - - I think thatll be all . Mr. Grainger . - Aye. aye. sir . - Mr. Grainger . - Sir . - Wire for further information on iceberg movements . - We did. this morning. sir . - Well. confirm them . - Aye. aye. sir . Look . Ray. we need some pressure magnification . A ship that size - it couldnt have been too long ago . Anybody recognize it ? I do . Id know those lines anywhere . Gentlemen. thats the Titanic , - A picture of the Titanic , - No. not a picture . It is the Titanic , Then Tony must be on board . When did the Titanic go down ? Ann. get the boys on the history computer to give us a complete rundown on the Titanic ... with pictures and cross-section diagrams . I want tonnage. speed . equipment - the works . Also. the year. day and minute she went down . But Dr , Newman is alive now , in our time , How could he be affected by something thats happening at the beginning of the century ? No , Hes living in that time zone now , Anything that happens to us wont affect him there ... but if hes on that ship when it goes down ... hell die along with the others . - Just a few minutes. maam . - Thank you . - How did you find me ? - I just spoke to the captain . Is it true that youre a stowaway ? In a sense. yes . And that youre trying to alarm passengers with - with wild stories of the ships safety ? Theres so much to explain . I dontt know where to begin . Tell me . Why are you behaving like this ? Do you know. its been a peaceful trip up till now . And then. out of nowhere. you - Well . I dont understand . I know you dont . Ive just begun to realize how stupid I am to think anybody could possibly understand . Would you let me try ? - Im glad you were concerned enough to ask about me . - Oh . Althea. do you believe in the future ? I mean , that there really is a future for you , your children , mankind ? Yes. of course I do . And obviously you believe in the past . Everybody does . But what if I were to tell you that the past and the future are the same ? - You thinKIm raving , - No. no . I dontt . I dont blame you . Suppose I told you that time itself doesnt exist . Its only motion we measure - the motion of the Earth spinning ... the orbit of the Earth around the sun . - Tony . Im sorry . - Oh. no. no . Im the one whoss sorry . I frightened you . You see. all I wanted to do was for you to let me help you . Sorry. maam . Captain said just a few minutes was all . Oh . Im just coming . Thank you . Why dont you let me tell the Captain that you didntt mean what you said ... and that you wont mention it again. hmm ? I cant promise that . Althea ... not when I know whats going to happen . But you dont know . Nobody knows . You cant . Thats it . Hold those coordinates . The captain said to Keep you quiet , If that means using chains. mister . I have them too . Doug , ! I dont Know if yourre picking me up , If youre just getting sound . Imm on the Titanic ... locked in a forward cabin just above the waterline . Hes a prisoner . Its 9 : 15 a , m ... April 14 , 1912 , I dont know when itss gonna sink. but - Theyve got me locked up ... because I tried to warn the captain . Hes right in the middle of the section that was slashed open by that iceberg . - What about the date ? - Lets see - TThe Titanic struck an iceberg late on Sunday evening . April 14 ... and sank during the early hours of Monday . April 15 . - Then hes got about 14 hours . - Fourteen hours . No. he hasnt . Senator . Tonys locked in a room that could be flooded as soon as they hit that berg . Were the ones that have 14 hours if werre going to try to save him . What can you do ? Theoretically , we can suspend Tony in his time zone and remove him from it , But. during that suspension . Tonys body processes - his heart , his breathing , his tissue regeneration - would all stop , Unless we can return him here or to some other time zone within seconds ... well kill him . - Thats what yourre thinking. isnttt it ? - Not exactly . There were over 300 men who survived the Titanic , Tony Knows what will happen , Ifhe were free on board , he could be one of those survivors , Yes. but we cant free him by remote control . - No. but we could go back and help him . - Doug. no . Yesterday. you refused to let Tony do what he went and did anyway. and you were right . What do you expect to do now except die with him ? What do you suggest ? We just sit here and watch him die ? At least my way hed have a chance . Remember . Ill appear there dressed for the period and prepared with the facts . That reminds me . Have Research get me a copy of a New York paper dated April 15 . 1912 . You and I have worked together long enough for you to know ... that I dont give orders just to play soldier . I know that . Woody . But. just this once. it might be the right thing to do . Now. we have a friend thats in danger . Youre trying to protect me from that danger , I appreciate that , But ifTony werent back there . this research would have come to a close . Isnt that true ? All right , Tonys risking his life to succeed where I failed . If we dont have the faith in what werre doing here ... and the guts to back up that faith - Woody . Dr. Newman took off on his own like a madman . If you let this man go . its a cold-blooded responsibility ... you might have to live with the rest of your life . Would you let me go if our positions were reversed ? Probably not . I turned Tony down . But Im hoping yourre tougher than I am . Prepare your briefing procedure . Ill organize a countdown . - Good luck . Doug . - Itll work . Senator . Doug. your master guidance control has been programmed ... for an identical overlay with Tonys . If you overshoot me a day or more . Ill get there before Tony . Or a day late . and you wind up ... in the freezing waters where the ship sank with Tony on it . Doug. please . Dont go . I have to . Ray. youll be calling the scientific shots from this end . Dont gamble unless you have to . But if you do have to. go for broke . Dont worry . Sixteen , 15 , 14 ... 13 , 12 ... 11 , 10 , nine ... eight , seven , six , five , four ... three , two , one , zero , Hey now ! Whered you come from ? Im sorry . I guess I should get back where I belong . Guess you should , Tourist , Oh . Its all right . Come on in . Anything wrong. son ? - Oh. excuse me. sir . - Its all right . Imm just washing up . Ah . You didnt happen to see a little French boy ... with his pockets bulging with food. did you ? - Did you say food ? - Yes. sir . His parents are immigrants in the third class . Hes been raiding the dining room tables in the first class for leftovers . Not that we blame the little fella. but . if you allow one. theyll all descend on you . - Of course . - The little fella seems to have given me the slip . Hes a clever little tyke . Now. who left this about ? - Thats mine . Thank you . - I see. sir . Carry on . - Its all clear . - Merci , monsieur , Merci bien , ! Oh. youre very welcome . Whatss your name. young man ? Marcel . Marcel Corbeau . Ah . Well . Im Dr. Phillips . Itss a pleasure to meet you . Marcel . Say . Im looking for a friend of mine . Hes supposed to be locked up somewhere in the third-class area . - Would you know anything about him ? - Friend ? - An American . - Ah ! Oui , oui , monsieur , The Am√©ricain , - Good . You think you could take me to him ? - Oui , Come with me . - Maybe you and I could figure out some way to get in to see him . - Oui , oui , Here ! Dont fool with that ! Tony . Hey , Tony , - Doug . - Are you all right ? That radiation gimmick of yours was great . Tony . We were able to home right in on you . I could even pick up the sound of your voice right through those bulkheads . I was able to pick this point in time exactly . You were out of your mind to come here . Now were both stucKon the ship , Leroy . Leroy ! Somethings coming through . No , were not , I have this , The guards coming back . Theyre together . Ann. regulate the probe for 50 % less radiation absorption . Its no good . The captain wont believe it . He thinks Imm some kind of conspirator already . Hell say I had it printed . - Why did you come here ? - I had to . You would have done the same for me . - But you know this ship is gonna sink tonight . - Maybe not . Doug. they wont listen . I tell you . I have tried . Tony. what if we were to get in to the ships wireless. take it over ? What if we were to wire for help before the collision ? - Thered be no Titanic disaster . - Exactly . Youre not afraid to try. are you ? The first thing we have to do is take care of that guard out there . All right . He thinks youre in here alone . Make some noise . Let me outta this place ! You hear me ! I said let me out . or Ill break a hole in this tub ! What the devil ? Youre asking for it. all right . Good afternoon. gentlemen . May I help you ? The Dutch liners picked up our C.Q. D. Get away from there ! Stop him ! What on earth ? So. its you . I see you have a confederate . - They were using the wireless. sir . - What ? This is no longer a prank . You are in serious trouble . I promise you that . I know you didnt believe my friend here . and you wontt believe me . But you can believe your own eyes . This ship will strike an iceberg at 11 : 40 tonight and go down , - The storys all here in tomorrowss paper . - Take them below . This time. see that they stay there . Captain. youve got to believe me ! Captain , were getting calls from many ships ... requesting our position and the nature of our distress . Tell them to disregard all distress signals from this ship . - We are in good order and safely under way . - Aye , sir , Oh. thank you . - Come with me . Mr. Grainger . - Aye. sir . - Would you wait outside for a moment . Mr. Grainger . - Aye. aye sir . We have hit an iceberg . just as the two of you predicted . - How could you have known ? - Captain. the only explanation is the truth . You see , we come from the year 1968 , Weve traveled back through time to this moment , Whats happening here is history to us . My reasoning cannot accept that . In any case. when we repair damage and reach New York ... perhaps a maritime inquiry can fathom your story . Captain. your ship is going down . That is impossible . This ship is unsinkable . This ship is dead . and so is everyone on board ... unless you give immediate orders to lower the lifeboats ! Captain , weve warned you of the collision , Please believe us about this , What have you got to lose ? Order those lifeboats away . - Mr. Grainger . - Sir . Order the crew to begin abandon ship procedure . - Abandon ship. sir ? But - - Do as I say . Aye. aye. sir . Very well. gentlemen . With more than 2.300 souls on board ... I cannot afford to ignore even the remotest possibility . Your lifeboats will only hold about 750 . How did you know that ? Well. despite the fact that this ship was built and advertised ... as the vessel that could not be sunk ... your life-saving equipment is insufficient and inadequate , Are you telling me that only 750 will survive ? Yes. sir . I see . My mind will not let me believe you . But I do believe in a God. gentlemen . If what you say is true . then only the fact that you were here ... will save those who do survive . I would have to consider that a miracle of Gods mercy . In a way. sir. perhaps it is . Captain. do you think maybe we could all be of more help on the decks ? Yes . Yes. of course . It occurs to me now you may even know whether I will die tonight . Yes. sir . Im afraid you will . You dont know that you can remove them from their present time zone . You might just kill them yourself . Whats our choice . General . to let them die with that ship ? Even if you do remove them . you wont have any control after that . Theyd disappear in time ... to any moment in the billions of years of the past or future . Is that any worse than condemning them to certain death aboard the Titanic ? I wonder . - Check the lifeboats on the upper deck . Ill see below . - Right . Help , ! Help , ! Mr. Thomas . Only women and children are to be allowed in the lifeboats . - That order is not to be violated . - Aye. aye. sir . - Mr. Martin . - Sir ! Advise the boiler room to evacuate all stations immediately . Mr. Williams . Assign six able-bodied seamen to assist the passengers in steerage . Aye. aye. sir . Althea ? What are you doing ? The ship is sinking . It doesnt matter for me . - Althea . - No . Tony . You dont understand . Ive no right to take a place on one of those lifeboats . Im not a rich girl on holiday . Imm just an ordinary schoolteacher . I spent the last penny of my savings for this trip . What difference does that make ? The difference is Im going to die soon anyway . - What are you talking about ? - Im ... ill . Theres a growth inside my head . Itss just a matter of months . - Are you sure ? - My doctor in London is sure . He said theres a doctor in New York whoss working on a new type of brain operation . Its called ... neurosurgery . I think . But its just a matter of months . - Theres really no hope . - Of course there is . Neurosurgery is not a fad . and its not hopeless . Althea. some brain operations have become as commonplace as taking out tonsils . - Become ? - Althea. youll just have to trust me . The chances that you can be helped are probably much better than you think . Are you a doctor too ? No . I am not a doctor . and youve no right to play God . Im not even attempting to play God . Youre deciding when itss time for you to live or die . You donttt have that right . You are asking me to believe in miracles . I am asking you to believe in life , not death , Althea. please. believe in me . Marcel , ! Marcel , ! Time to take a ride now . Women and children only ! - Put this on . - Whats going to happen to you ? - Never mind that now . Hurry . - I wont see you again . Come on. miss. if youre going . Tony , theres trouble on A Deck . Follow me . Doug ! Tony ! - Freeze them ! - What happened to them ? Theyre alive - if the time transfer worked . - Where ? - We dont really know . - Can we establish any limits ? - Not with certainty . - Hurry , ! Theyre dying , ! - Accelerate power . The Tunnels gone blank . Well. wherever he and Doug are now ... at least theyre together . But where ? We couldnt begin to guess . Leroy . SergeantJiggs will escort you to the surface . - A cars waiting for you there . - Thanks . Woody . - Good-bye . Doctor . - Good-bye . Senator. and thank you very much. sir . Of course. my committee will take no action on this ... until Phillips and Newman are safely back ... or beyond hope . But I. uh - I will have to give some estimate of their chances . Were doing everything we can . Were perfecting our technique and apparatus every day . Id have to say . without trying to be funny ... that its just a matter of time . Well. it always helps to keep a sense of humor about things . - Good-bye . Doctor . Good luck . Woody . - Good-bye. sir . - Leroy . - This way , sir , Ray . Are you being optimistic . or am I being pessimistic ? Well . General. we know theyre still alive ... and weve started another location probe . Which wont mean beans ... unless they can survive ... wherever they are . This is Mission Control , We are at launch minus 60 seconds and counting , Launch minus 55 , Minus 50 , Minus 45 , Launch minus 40 and counting , - Minus 35 , - Its a rocket . Tony. if this is one of those early Canaveral jobs ... we could be blown up right here on the pad , Minus 25 , Minus 20 and counting , - Its no use . Itss locked off . - Fifteen , Get down here quick . Off your feet . Ten , nine , eight ... seven , six , five ... four , three , two ... one-ignition ,

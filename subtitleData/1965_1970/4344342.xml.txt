 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages . During the first experiments on America 's greatest ... and most secret project , the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly ... toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . [ Man On Speaker ] This is Mission Control . We are at launch minus 45 . Launch minus 40 and counting . Minus 35 . - It 's a rocket ! - Minus 30 . Tony , if this is one of those early Canaveral jobs , we could be blown up ... - right here on the pad . - Twenty-five . Minus 20 and counting . [ Grunting ] - Fifteen . - It 's no use . It 's locked off . Get down here , quick . Off your feet . Ten , 9 , 8 , 7 ... 6 , 5 , 4 ... 3 , 2 , 1 , ignition . We 're coasting at zero gravity . We 're back to one " " G. " This capsule 's spinning to create its own gravity . - Then there 's someone else aboard . - There 's no doubt about it . Artificial gravity . That means this is a pretty sophisticated model . - " M.E.M. ' " - [ Softly ] M.E.M. Tony , that 's " Mars Excursion Module . ' " We 're on an expedition to Mars . - Escape velocity ? - [ Man ] Negative . - Inform Mission Control . - Can 't raise them , Skipper . We 've been out of radio contact since liftoff . Keep trying . Beard , what do we lack ? - Seventy-five knots . - Doc ? What 's the computer 's analysis of the failure ? We 're carrying excess weight in the service module . - 33 5 pounds . - That 's beyond our safety factor . Seal off the module . Cut it loose . We 're gonna blow it up . - You 're not gonna scrub the mission . - Can you think of a better choice right now ? Yes , we can wait and see if we attain escape velocity . We won 't . We 're past due now . Nazarro . See if you can get that information to Mission Control . - M.E.M. 4 is scrubbed . - Yes , sir . M.E.M. 4 to Mission Control . M.E.M. 4 to Mission Control . We 've got an overload problem and cannot reach escape velocity . Colonel Kane has ordered us to jettison the service module and destroy it . We are going to fire our retros and attempt reentry . Mission Control , do you read ? Service module - that 's us ! - They don 't know we 're in here . - We gotta stop ' em . [ Grunts ] - Hey , let us out ! - Mission Control , I say again ... we are about to jettison the service module and attempt reentry . If you read me , stand by for destruct of service module . Stand by . Let us out ! Don 't cut us loose ! [ Kirk ] Any further identification , Ray ? It 's definitely the M.E.M. flight series . That puts the time ten years in the future . Exactly what I reported to Washington . - To Washington , General ? - Yes , of course . They 're extremely interested . Vice Admiral Killian ... of the new Department of Space is being rushed down here to observe . Ann , what kind of response ? Not the best , I 'm afraid . But I think we can hold it . Easy , easy . Let 's not lose picture before Killian gets here . Stand by to jettison the service module . Nazarro , give me a ten-second countdown . Yes , sir . Mark . Ten , 9 , 8 ... 7 , 6 ... 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 - [ Rockets Firing ] [ Rocket Engines Stop ] - What was that ? - Velocity 's increasing . Minus 20 and rising . We 're gonna make it . Escape velocity : we made it . I gave no order to fire the boosters . - It was an accident . - How did that happen ? Well , all I know , sir , is we reached escape velocity . There 's no longer any reason to scrub the mission . - Doc , give me a fuel reading . - That was a 20 % expenditure . Twenty . We can 't brake for the Mars landing ... and expect to lift off again . We could use the backup plan , sir . All right . We 'll interrupt the flight and land on the moon . - Nazarro ? - Yes , sir . Have you been able to reach Mission Control yet ? Negative . Not a peep out of them . Could they be receiving us , even though we can 't read them ? That 's possible , but there 's no way to check . Make a report . Tell them we 're landing on the moon to refuel from the lunar stockpiles . - Then we 're proceeding with the Mars flight . - Yes , sir . [ Nazarro On Speaker ] M.E.M. 4 to Mission Control : We are not , repeat , not going tojettison the service module . We are reducing voltage to recharge power cells . The Mars mission is still go . Flight plan now is to soft-land on the moon ... and refuel from lunar stockpile . The Mars mission is still go . Do you read me , Mission Control ? Do you read me ? Doc , give me a hand with the hatch cover . - There 's our excess weight . - Get up here . Both of you . Who the devil are you ? Where did you come from ? Nazarro , see if they 're armed . - How 'd you get on board ? - I 'm Dr. Newman . This is Dr. Phillips . - From the Time Tunnel Complex . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . What year is this ? - 1 97 8 , of course . - Then you must have heard of us by now . We 're time travelers . We started ten years ago . - It was top secret then , but now - - They 're insane ! We 're not . Time Tunnel is a government project , and we 're part of it . We 're actually traveling in time . We wound up here , ten years in the future . - What do you mean , the future ? - It 's our future ... but it 's your present - Only , we 're part of it now . [ Sighs ] Never mind , Tony . They won 't listen . Of all people , you 'd think they 'd understand . - We understand . - You didn 't expect us to believe a wild story like that , did you ? Wait a minute . It 's a wild story , all right , but you know , it just could be true . A few years ago , a friend of mine - we went to medical school together - got transferred out west to some hush-hush government project . - Did he say what it was ? - Not in so many words . - But I gathered it was in Arizona . - Go on . That 's all there is . Except that some of the remarks that he let slip ... seemed pretty odd - but they 'd make good sense if there were such a project as , uh - - What-What 'd you call it ? - Time Tunnel . - And it does make sense , because it 's true . - Sorry . I don 't buy it . - Well , we 're here on this ship . You can 't explain that away . - I can . We 're in the middle of the biggest race in history . A race to put the first men on another planet in the solar system . Other governments would do anything to make sure we don 't win that race . - That 's for certain . - Ask ' em to prove their story . Papers . - Identification . Anything . - All right . Let 's have it . If we 'd had identification , we would have shown it to you before this . - That does it . - Even if you don 't believe us , we 're here . What can you do about it now ? - What do we do with ' em , Skipper ? - Lock ' em up ! Come on , Tony . - Now what ? - I don 't know . Every answer I come up with is impossible . Has it occurred to you to accept their explanation ? Time travel ? I wouldn 't believe that in a million years . That 's a funny statement , under the circumstances . Here we are in space , headed for the moon . And Mars , beyond that . - Is their story any more fantastic than ours ? - It is to me . Doctor , these men are stowaways . Probably foreign agents . - It 's as simple as that . - No , it isn 't . If they 're stowaways , how 'd they get on board ? - You know the security at the launching pad . - All right . All right . Maybe we can 't explain how they got on board . Actually , what difference does it make ? The one really important fact is , they are here . - That 's what we 've got to deal with . - But how ... - when we don 't know what or who they are ? - I know one thing they are . Over 300 pounds of additional weight . Now , we 've got a tricky maneuver coming up , a soft landing on the moon . You want to tackle that with this handicap ? I sure don 't . Neither do I , but that 's something we 're stuck with . Is it ? In my book , there 's a simple solution that will take care of everything . Throw them off the ship . Set them adrift . Ray , haven 't you regained contact yet ? Not yet , General . We expect to momentarily . Certainly hope so . These are the gentlemen from the Space Department . I want you and Ann to meet them . Dr. Brandon , Dr. MacGregor and Dr. Swain . - Doctor . - If I appear bewildered , I am . - This is a most impressive complex . - And this is Admiral Killian . - I 'm honored , Admiral . - Thank you , Dr. Swain . - May I present my aide , Ensign Beard ? - How do you do ? - How do you do ? - Dr. MacGregor . I don 't care what your figures say , Beard . You can 't be serious . I 'm perfectly serious . You mean , you 'd put those men outside the ship ? - They 'd die in seconds ! - Immediately and painlessly . - Their troubles would be over and so would ours . - You sure about these facts ? - Well , that is a preliminary estimate . - Well , make a thorough check . I want to know exactly what to expect if we attempt a landing with them on board . - Yes , sir . - You can 't listen to him . It 's outrageous . - It 's inhuman ! - I know how you feel , Doc . But I 've gotta think about the safety of the whole ship . - And of the mission . - I warn you . I won 't let you do it . You 're a little out of your area , aren 't you , Doctor ? You don 't have to worry about that . Excess baggage is our problem . Kane , listen to me . Ever since the space program started , we 've put a premium on human life . - Nothing was of greater importance-nothing . ! - This is a special case . We 're sacrificing two lives to save four . That makes sense . It makes no sense at all , and if you could reach Mission Control ... they 'd veto this crackbrained plan of yours , hands down . I 'm not so sure of that . What do you think , Skipper ? No word from Mission Control ? No , sir . I 'm still trying . The question is , Colonel , can we make a soft lunar landing with two extra men on board ? Now , I don 't think we can . Let 's face it , Colonel . If we don 't get ' em off the ship ... we 're all gonna die . I can 't believe it . Is that me ? You , 1 0 years from now . - I don 't believe I 'm saying those things . - Well , I 'm afraid it 's true . You just can 't tell about the future . [ Clicks Switch ] [ Ann ] There they are . Ann , what are you trying to do ? I 'm going to transfer them , while I still can . You can 't do that . It 's too dangerous . We 're not certain of the fix yet . - Ray , he 's planning to jettison them . - To save the mission . Their added weight could make a soft lunar landing impossible . That 's a point I 'd like more information on . - Ray , how can we get it ? - I think there 's a way , General . With the help of Admiral Killian and Dr. Brandon . Gentlemen , together we could compile enough data on the M.E.M. flight program ... to give our computer something to work on . That way , we could tell whether the landing is possible . Will you do it ? - Of course , Doctor . We 'd be glad to . - Certainly . Good ! We can start at once . - Right this way . - Very well . Ray . Ray , I don 't care what data you process . We can 't just sit here and let Doug and Tony be killed . Ann , we won 't . If the computer indicates that a soft landing is impossible ... we 'll risk shifting them in time , whether we have a good fix on them or not . [ Engines Roaring ] - How are you coming ? - Getting along . I 'll have the answer for you in a minute . If there 's the slightest chance of being able to make a soft lunar landing , I want to know . Right . - Anything ? - Yes , sir . I think so . - Well ? - [ Grunts ] Look here . This coil , and several others in there , have been eaten through ... by some sort of a slow-working acid . It severed our connections to the aft antenna . - Any way to fix it ? - Not without getting out on the hull ... but even then , I doubt if I could do much - this has done a pretty thorough job ... of severing communications completely . - Sabotage . - Well , it 's the only possible explanation . - Those two ? - That would be my guess , yes , sir . Mine too . I think Beard may have a point . - Go down and get them . And take a gun . - Yes , sir . Doc , give me a hand with this hatch cover . - What now ? - All right , Skipper wants to see you topside . [ Beeping ] - Small meteor on intersecting course . - [ Rapid Beeping ] - Can we avoid it ? - No time . We 're gonna be hit . Hold on ! [ Air Hissing ] Meteor . We 're losing all our air . When it 's gone , we 're dead ! Here . Space suits . Put ' em on , quick . It 's the service module , all right . The atmosphere is draining fast . - Nazarro 's trapped with those other two . - Our space suits are down there . Let 's see if we can get them . [ Buzzing ] [ Buzzing Stops ] We can 't open the hatch now . The air in there is gone . Well , that solves all our problems . Your stowaways are dead now . And so is Nazarro . They never had a chance . [ Doug On Speaker ] How do you turn this darn thing on ? It 's on . We hear you . - Can you hear us ? - Loud and clear . [ Kane ] How bad 's the hull damage ? - It 's pretty bad , Skipper . - [ Doug ] Tell us how to make repairs . - We 'll follow instructions . - It 's not as simple as you may think . We 're both trained physicists . We know how to follow directions . We 'll manage . [ Tony ] You must have some kind of sealant stored in here . Where is it ? It 's in a locker at the forward end . Behind the hatch ladder . Nazarro will show you . - He 's got it . Now what ? - I told you it wasn 't simple . It 's a double hull . Both sides have to be repaired . One from where you are and the other on the outside . You 're not gonna let those two walk that hull ! - Beard 's right . They 're untrained . - Nazarro 's trained . - Nazarro can 't do it alone . - All right . Fine . What 's the alternative ? - Give up ? - He 's right . Trained or not ... they 're gonna have to do it . Now , listen . You 've got to walk out on the hull . You can 't fall . You 're moving with the same velocity as the ship . You 're weightless . There 's no up or down for you out there . We 're going out ! We 'll fix it ! [ Machine Clicking ] How much longer before they finish ? In a few minutes , if they finish at all . After what they 're doing , you 're not gonna have them jettisoned are you ? No . Not after this . And suppose their weight makes a soft landing impossible ? - Do your figures tell you that ? - I 'm still working on it . What if we can 't make a soft landing ? Then we orbit the moon , head back to Earth . And lose the race to Mars . I thought that was the most important consideration of all . We won 't lose the race if we turn back , Beard . It doesn 't matter which one of our crews win . This isn 't a race for personal glory . Our backup team can be ready to lift off in less than two weeks . I 'll take a look at the aft antenna . Maybe I can rig up something to restore communications . [ Clicking ] You all right out there ? What progress ? [ Doug ] We 're finished . The hull 's patched , and we 're coming in . Full atmosphere restored in the service module . Nice work . You can get out of the space suits now . Your compartment now has normal atmosphere . Here are the results . We can compensate for the added weight . Landing is go . Very well . We 'll commit ourselves to the landing . - [ Ray ] What 's happening ? - They 've got a favorable estimate . - They 're going to try for the soft landing . - They can 't do that . - Why not ? - We 've just finished an estimate of our own . - If they try to land , they 'll crash . - Can 't you do something ? [ Sighs ] No response . I can 't move them . Too fast . We 're descending too fast . Can 't you veer off ? Change into an orbit ? No . We 're committed . We 've got to set down now . - Nazarro , you and Doc get the space suits . - Yes , sir . - I want all hands to put ' em on . - Why space suits ? If any part of the hull cracks when we hit the surface ... wearing a space suit is the only possibility of survival . - There are only four suits down there . - I know . You better pray the hull withstands the landing . It 's your only hope of staying alive . There 's no stopping it now . They 've got to crash . [ Rockets Burning ] We 're going to impact ! Hang on and pray ! I don 't know how it happened . We 're still airtight . Any casualties ? It wasn 't a soft landing , but at least it was a landing . We 've been very lucky . We 've maintained the integrity of the hull , which is a miracle . Once we 've made some minor repairs and refueled , we can lift off again for Mars . Let 's not waste time . How far to the fuel dump ? Now our point of impact is right here . In this quadrant of the Mare Nectaris . The fuel dump is located here . No more than a half mile to the west . Now our main problem is time . If we can 't refuel and lift off in precisely 22 minutes ... we can 't make it . 22 minutes . We 've still got a chance , if I go for fuel while repairs are being made . - I agree . Nazarro , you check the hull and the aft burners . - Right . I 'll need someone to help me with the fuel . Doc Harlow ? - Okay , Skipper ? - It is ! Go with him , Doc . That takes care of everyone but us . What can we do to help ? Well , now , that 's a problem . You still don 't suspect us of being agents , do you ? Frankly , I don 't know who you are . And it 's a pretty academic question at this point . You can 't go outside the ship . There are no more space suits . - Can we do anything to help ? - You can help by obeying orders . You two will stay here , where I can keep an eye on you . They 'll be heading for the fuel dump now . - I 've got a clear fix on them now . - Switch them . - How many will we need ? - Four . We 'll each take two . Two ? They must weigh a hundred pounds apiece ! That 's on Earth . Up here , we divide by six . Remember , Doc ? - Oh . Hard to get used to , isn 't it ? - Yeah . You ready ? Yes , Doctor . I 'm quite ready . - Let 's go back to the ship . - Oh , there 's no rush . You see , this is the end of the M.E.M. flight . - The end ? I - I don 't understand . - You will , Doctor . You will . [ Air Hissing ] - [ Screaming ] - Did you hear that ? Sounded like a scream . - Nazarro . Are you all right ? - Still working on the hull , Skipper . - Beard . Do you read me ? - Loud and clear . - Ask him about Harlow . - Has anything happened to Major Harlow ? - [ Clicks Radio ] - He had a little trouble with his intercom , but he 's okay . - We 'll be bringing fuel in now . - All right . As soon as you can . - Are you satisfied ? - No . - Neither am I. Beard 's lying . - What makes you think so ? A little matter of two and two . We know somebody sabotaged your communication system . It wasn 't your radioman . He 's the one that discovered it . And I doubt that it was Major Harlow . - And we didn 't do it , so that leaves Beard . - Why ? Doesn 't make any sense . It does to me . Now somebody hired Beard ... to make sure that America loses that race to Mars . Beard , an agent ? I don 't believe it . He 's done everything he could to keep me from aborting this mission . Naturally . If you return to Earth , your backup crew would leave immediately for Mars . - They still can . - Not until Mission Control finds out what happened to this crew . Now that 's basic policy . And by the time they do ... if ever , it 'll be too late to win . Come on . Admit it . You see it as clearly as we do . What am I expected to do about this ? Get out there and find out what Beard 's doing . Now , before it 's too late . And leave you two with the run of the ship ? All right . Then give us your suit . One of us will go . No dice , gentlemen . If there are any agents on this mission ... I 'm looking at them right now . Don 't let him near that intercom , Tony . I don 't want him to warn Beard . All right , Colonel . Get out of that space suit . - What do you think , Ray ? - Oh , we 'll get it fixed , of course . We 're lucky nobody was hurt . - How did it happen ? - We can 't tell yet . It was an accident , wasn 't it ? I 'm not so sure . - [ Cocks Gun ] - Stand up . Don 't touch that intercom button . Where are the other three ? If I told you , I wouldn 't be very bright , would I ? Two of them have to be in the capsule . There are only four space suits . That still leaves one man unaccounted for , doesn 't it ? - And you don 't know where he is . - I 'll find him . Will you ? He could be anywhere . He could be right outside that door . - You 're in a lot of trouble , Beard . - You 're the one in trouble . I 've got enough provisions to last me for six months . I 'm gonna kill all of you . And wait . Wait ? Wait for what ? For our own Mars flight . - They 're gonna pick me up . - You don 't really believe that , do you ? Once your job is done here , why you 're expendable . All right . Don 't move . Excuse me , gentlemen . SergeantJiggs has just come from our security center ... with some very distressing news - Sergeant ? - Will you please repeat what you just told me ? - Yes , sir . At 1 400 hours , my security section received a call from Central Intelligence . They informed me that for some time now , there 's been an enemy agent ... working within the Space Department . They have reason to believe one of you three visitors ... may be that agent . - Why , this is outrageous - - I 'm sorry , Admiral , but I really have no choice . You gentlemen will be taken to our security center for questioning . - Look here , General - - Please , Doctor . Carry on , Sergeant . Yes , sir . [ Groans ] - All right , hold it ! - Brandon , what in the name of - I said hold it , Admiral . All right , Sergeant . I 'll take that gun . Over there . You too . Over there . - That 's better . - What are you trying to do , Brandon ? Don 't be naive , General . - I can 't let you live now . - [ Gunfire ] Nobody move . Ray ! Take Ann out of here . Steer clear of this area until we tighten down.Jiggs ! Sound a full security alert ! [ Siren Wailing ] [ Siren Continues ] Freeze . Take your hand off that mike . Things aren 't going quite according to plan , are they ? - You should have heard from your friend by this time . - [ Scraping ] All right , get over there . You don 't know who that is coming in , do you ? I said , get over . Now give me a hand with the hatch . - Nazarro ! Give a warning on the intercom ! - Help ! Command Module to - - I wouldn 't . - And there 's our missing man . [ Gunfire ] Now if you 're smart , you won 't try anything . - He 's gonna open the outer door ! - Secure the hatch , quick . Tony ! Tony , can you hear me ? This is Kane . What 's going on out there ? This is Doug Phillips . Harlow 's been murdered by Beard here in the depot . - Murdered ? - He was gonna try and blow up your spaceship . - How much time left ? - Just under 1 2 minutes . - Well , get ready to blast off . - We have no fuel . I 'm bringing it ! - Where 's Beard ? - [ Sighs ] I left him back at the depot . I don 't know whether he 's alive or dead , but frankly , right now I don 't care . I brought your fuel back . Let 's get ready to take off . - Where 's Tony ? - He went to look for you . - [ Clicking Intercom ] - Tony ? I 'm aboard the ship . We 're getting ready to blast off . Get back here immediately . - Tony ! Can you read me ? - He must have his intercom switch off . We 've got to lift off . We can 't wait . I 'm going back to get him . - Can you two maneuver this craft alone ? - If we have to . All right , then . Get ready to blast off , get your fuel in . - How much time do I have left ? - Only a few minutes . I 'll try to get him back here on time . If I don 't , you take off without us , do you understand ? I think I do . Finally . Here . You may need this . Well , there 's no way he can leave this level . - Only a matter of time before we take him . - Brandon . I just can 't believe it . One of our best men . - They often are . - [ Footsteps ] You three men , work your way around , cover that section . The rest of you take that area . Okay , Beard . Get up ! Move out of there . [ Clattering ] [ Air Hose Hissing ] Come on ! The ship 's blasting off ! . We 've gotta get back ! [ Ticking ] [ Ticking Continues ] [ Softly ] Brandon ! Brandon ? It 's Beard . - You haven 't got a chance . - I 've got one chance . You . You 're trapped , Brandon . There 's guards everywhere . It 's your job to protect me . Remember my importance to the organization . I have to think about the mission . The mission will be completed . Now look . I 'm gonna hide out here . You lead them away from me . - [ Men Running ] - Then when things cool off - [ Running Continues ] All right . I 'll try . Gimme a gun . I may need it ! Give me a gun ! - [ Cocks ] - Brandon ? [ Sighs ] Well - [ Doug ] M.E.M. Come in . M.E.M. The lunar depot has been destroyed . Beard is dead . Repeat , Beard is dead . M.E.M. 4 , calling M.E.M. 4 . Kane , do you read me ? Can you read me ? - What 's wrong ? Why can 't they hear us ? - [ Rocket Blasting ] Look ! - We 're too late . - We 're stranded . We 've only got enough air for a couple of hours . - After that , how do we survive ? - Maybe we don 't . - Try for a time lock . Quick . Before we lose them . - Power , all units ! [ Explosion ] - [ Explosion Continues ] - Tony ! [ Explosion ] [ Whistling ] [ Shouting ] - [ Whistling Continues ] - [ All Clamoring ] - Where 's the rest of the crew ? - Trapped . Trapped ! Over 200 of 'em . All trapped . [ Explosion ] [ Whistling Continues ] This way ! It 's blocked off here . Go the other way . Hey , you ! Get out of here ! - [ Explosion ] - Hold on ! [ Coughing ] - What 's happened ? - There are men trapped back there . - How many ? - Must be 200 . You better get out of here . There 'll be more explosions . - We 've got to get them out ! - No ! That 's my job ! Now you get out of here ! [ Rocks Falling ]

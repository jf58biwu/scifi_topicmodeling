 ( Grunts ) ( Grunting throughout fight ) ( Horse snorting ) Man : Welcome to harmony , stranger . ( Saloon piano playing in background ) Harmony ? Never heard of it . Not many people have , senor . It 's sort of ... Exclusive . So am I. Where is this town ? You 'll find out , senor , it 's not wise to ask too many questions here . Hey , hombre ... you look like a man who could use a drink . Why you not try the saloon ? ( People talking and piano playing ) ( Conversations and music stop ) On the house . Regulars get the first one on the house . I 'm not regular . I 'm Cathy . It 's a nice name . ( Quit fires ) Man : Come and join me , sheriff . Whiskey . You know me . You shouldn 't have done that . A man needs all the friends he can find . I don 't know you . I know you . I know all about you ... that 's why you 're here . Where ? Here . Cathy , bring us some more whiskey . He 's good . Sensitive , but one of the best . He 's mean . You got plenty of those . I could use some more . Like yourself , for instance . I 'm not for hire . You turned in your badge . And my gun . What were your reasons ? My reasons . You 've already taken a job . Who with ? With whom ? Look , I 'm offering you a job . Harmony 's a good town . Runs smooth and peaceful . Now , let 's be friendly . Red two ... On the black three . Think it over . I already have . Have you ? I 'm moving on . When you change your mind , I 'll be here . ( Coin drops onto bar ) ( Horses snorting ) How much ? Sold . The bay . Yeah . How much ? 5,000 dollars . The rest . They 're expensive . ( Mumbles ) : How 's business ? Well , stranger , fancy living in harmony ? Not my kind of town . It 's a good town . Enjoy it . Why ? What 's wrong with our town , mister ? Maybe I don 't like the way it 's run . Oh , you just do as the judge says ... he 'll look after you . I look after myself . It 's a good town . Keep it . So , you don 't like our town , huh ? You insult us ! Are we going to let him do this ? He 's insulted our town . ( Crowd yelling angrily ) ( Quit fires ) All right , folks . We 'll take care of him ... now , git . ( Crowd yelling angrily and jeering ) Changed your mind yet ? Charge ? Protective custody . Lock him up . And bring Johnson out here . We mustn 't disappoint the crowd . ( Crowd continues yelling ) Man : There he is . ( Hysterically ) : Stop it ! Stop it ! You can 't hang my brother . He 's done nothing wrong . ( Wailing ) : You promised ! Let go of me , let go ! ( Crowd continues yelling ) ( Screams ) ( Door ape-hf ) ( Saloon piano playing in background ) I brought you a drink , kid . You know , I 've always liked you , kid . Hey , kid ... how about pouring me one ? ( Piano continues playing ) Oh , not now , kid . I 've got to get back to the saloon . I 'll drop by later . ( Door closes ) ( Keys rattling ) ( Breathing heavily ) ( People murmuring ) There 's only one way out . That 's due north . ( Clicks tongue at horse ) Hyah ! Man : Hyah ! ( Man barks at horse ) ( People laughing in distance ) Let justice be done . Order , order . Court in session . What 's the charge ? Against you ? None . You were only held in protective custody . You 're free to go . The people of harmony against Catherine Johnson . ( People murmuring ) The accused , step forward . You 're accused of aiding a prisoner to escape . How do you plead ? But , judge , you just said he weren 't a criminal . He was being held in protective custody . She didn 't know that . How do you plead ? Have you reached a verdict ? We have , your honor . Do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty ? Foreman : Guilty . I will pass sentence later . Take her away . ( People murmuring ) When you work for me , I 'll let her go . You 're a bad judge . We 'll see . We 'll see . Give me a whiskey . Judge : Hold it . I 've been looking for you , kid . Decided to give you your old job back . Go and take care of the jail . Prisoner : You 'll need two of these to take care of a woman . There 's always another time , kid . The kid 's real fond of Cathy . But he does tend to get ... Over-affectionate . If anything happens , it 'll be paid for . Nothing could happen if you were sheriff . Let her go . Let her out , kid . I said , let her out . Don 't give me any problems . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . She 's safe now ... safe for as long as you work for me . But enough of that . We don 't want to start off on the wrong foot . You 're going to like this job . It 's most rewarding . No , sheriff , you won 't regret joining my outfit . No , you may . You 're just sore for the moment . Here , put this on , you 'll feel better . Nothing but the best . I agree to wear the badge , but not the gun . It 's a start . But you 'll find this a rough town without a gun . Morning , sheriff ... I 'm Zeke . I don 't carry a gun either . But then , I don 't need one . Zeke : No , he 's mine . The boys are just teaching him it 's not safe to walk around without guns . Are you hurt ? Nothing a bit of water won 't take care of . I 'm sorry ... I 'm blushing . I didn 't think I could blush anymore . That 's all right . Get out or they 'll kill you . Last time I got out ... They dragged me back and ... I can 't refuse that kind of hospitality . Can I ? You saw what they did to my brother . That 's one of the reasons I 'm staying . He was a stubborn man , too . I 'll be in the saloon tonight . Regulars get the first one ... On the house . ( Lively piano music , yelling and laughing ) ( All exclaim ) Come on , bartender , let 's have some whiskey ! Drink up , they 're on me ! Come on , Cathy , you 're going to have a drink on me . Cathy : Well , okay , will . Don 't let your wife catch you . ( Others laughing ) Ow ! ( Room goes silent ) Now , just a minute . ( Draws deep sigh ) Will drew first , sheriff . You 're the sheriff , it 's up to you . Man : Yeah , you 're the sheriff , time you did something ! Man 2 : Get some guns on ! Others : Yeah , get some guns . Man : You 're wearing the star , you know , sheriff , come on ! ( Door shuts , man in boots approaches ) Man : Some of us have been talking , sheriff . Yeah . You 're the only man who stood up to the judge so we 're with you . Yeah . We 'll help you clean up the town . You 're ... going to help me clean up your town . We can 't do it by ourselves . And , sheriff ... neither can you . Get yourself some coffee . Whiskey . Judge : That one 's on me . Come over , Jim . Jim , you disappoint me ... your choice of friends . Jim , old friends are the best friends . What were you talking to the sheriff about ? Well , if you don 't tell me I 'm sure you 'll tell the boys . ( Door opens , then slams shut ) ( Saloon piano playing in background ) And still , he doesn 't wear guns . We 're leaving tonight . But I told you , the pass is guarded . You 'll never make it with me . Be on the edge of town ... After the saloon closes . I 'll be there . The kid wouldn 't be too happy if he saw them with their heads together like that . I think someone should tell him . ( Horse whinnies ) Get out of my way . You 're crazy ... now , get out of my way ! ( Cries out ) ( Gasping and choking ) You beat him , and he was the fastest I 've ever seen . Fastest you ever will see ... I just quit . You aren 't quitting while I 've got Cathy . Just get it clear : You work for me guns and all . You haven 't got Cathy any longer . She 's dead . But he was only supposed to ... Rough her up a little bit . Hold it ! You work for me whether you like it or not . Nobody walks out on me . I 'm not letting you join some other outfit . I 'll kill you first . You 've got five seconds to make up your mind . One ... Two ... Three ... Four ... ( Gunshot ) ( Another gunshot ) ( Marching band playing in background ) ( Music fading in and out ) Interesting that he can separate fact from fantasy so quickly . I told you he was different . I knew it wouldn 't work ! Fill him with hallucinatory drugs put him in a dangerous environment talk to him through microphones ! It 's always worked and it would 've worked this time if ... But it didn 't , did it ? Give him love , take it away ! Isolate him , make him kill then face him with death , he 'll crack . Break him , even in his mind , and the rest will be easy . I should never have listened to you ! It would have worked if you had kept your head and not created the crisis too soon . How could I control it ? Tell me that ! You said yourself we would get involved and do what we would in the real situation . Well , then don 't blame my methods just your own damned lack of self-control . It 's all right for you , ' I have to answer for this failure . ( ï¬‚ying ) ( Door ape-hf ) ( Door shuts ) It seems I 'm not the only one who got involved . ( Saloon piano playing in background ) Oh ! What are you doing here , number eight ? The game 's over , number eight . Cathy ... ( Gasps ) Screaming y ( number eight shrieking ) I wish it had been real . Get away from me , judge , get away . Don 't hit me no more ... Don 't hit me ... No more ... no ... no more ! ( Number eight screaming ) ( Thud ) ( Loud slam echoes )

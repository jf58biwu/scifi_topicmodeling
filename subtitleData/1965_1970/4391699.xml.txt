 ( ambulance siren wailing ) His name 's Thatcher . He just staggered out of his room , made a phone call there and collapsed . No ... no ... Cavanaugh 's ... please ... I 've got to get to Cavanaugh 's . ( siren wailing ) ( horn blaring ) What the devil do you think you 're doing ? Sorry . Public Health Service . We got a call you got a man with cholera . Cholera ? You 've got to be kidding . I wish we were . Give us a hand . Help us get him to the car . Without any tests , how can you be sure ? I mean , he sure doesn 't have the symptoms of ... we 'll take him to our hospital in San Francisco and put him in quarantine , okay ? Okay . Let me check with Emergency . Hello , Emergency . ( buzzing ) Hey , what are you do ... ? Wreck it . NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here , that they 've taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Andrew Prine ... Dawn Wells ... Tim McIntire ... Tom Lowell . NARRATOR : An ambulance wrecked on a California highway- - its two attendants dead . Cause of death , in both cases , cerebral hemorrhage . To the world , a bizarre coincidence . To David Vincent , much more . Well , I 'm no doctor , Mr. Vincent , but Mr. Thatcher looked to me like ... Like what ? Well , this is going to sound crazy , because he was so sick and all , but my little girl came down with it last week , so I know the symptoms . What was it ? Chickenpox . Plain , old-fashioned chickenpox . Did Mr. Thatcher have any friends or relatives that you know of ? Someone who might know where he is ? Well , I know where he wanted to go when they dragged him into the ambulance . Where was that ? Look , I have some coffee inside . Why don 't you come in ? Uh , no , thank you very much . I wish I had time , but , uh , you know . Where did he want to go ? He said the name again and again . A place called Cavanaugh 's . Okay , take it away . ( tapping on rock ) ( screaming ) Welcome to God 's country . Uh , can you be a little more specific ? Oh ... oh , Bowman County . Well , I 'm lost , you see . Well , uh , 20 ... oh , about 20 mile outside of Griffin . What ? Did you think you were on Mars ? Yeah . Someplace like that . Uh , do you have a couple of minutes , Mr. , uh ... Devin . Sure . Uh , Dr. Devin . I want you to take a look at something . What ? I believe the newspapers call them flying saucers . ( snickering ) What do you call them , pal ? Want to take a look ? Sure . It 's a science class , anyway . Where is it ? It 's in a basin just beyond these rocks . Oh , well ... let 's take the truck . Vern Corbin . David Vincent . You 're not putting us on ? Did you see or hear anything ? We just got in here a few minutes ago . Pardon Vern for being dense , man . He 's just never seen a saucer before and , you know ... You think it 's from outer space ? DAVID : Yes . Even if it doesn 't pan out , I 've always thought there were saucers . How big is it ? About 50 , 60 feet in diameter . Did you get a look inside ? Yes . I suppose you flew in it , too , huh ? ( chuckling ) : That 's beautiful . Hal , why don 't you just shut up until we find out what it 's all about ? HAL : Well , let 's go see a flying saucer , kids . That 's what the man says . A flying saucer . Well , hi . I 'm , uh ... I 'm Steve . This is Nicole . ( engine starts ) It 's just over the hill . It was right down there . ( snickering ) Well , you win a few and you lose a few , don 't you , pal ? All right , can we have a cease-fire long enough to figure this thing out ? Okay ... now , he could be a crank but , uh , he doesn 't sound like one to me . He 's an architect with a graduate degree . And a pair of $ 30 shoes . Maybe he 's a rich crank . Yeah . She 's right about the shoes , Doctor . We were just talking about them . Yeah . We figure he couldn 't have walked very far , at least , not through this . Well , maybe he parachuted or bicycled . Hal , please . Do you believe him ? No . I don 't think I do . Do you ? No ... but I 'd like to know more . Can you stay away from each other 's throats , huh ? I 'll be back after we 've kicked it around . Why don 't you take the truck back to the campsite ? NICOLE : Be careful , Doctor . VERN : Doc ... Yeah . I don 't want to , uh , foul up your trip , but , uh ... Yeah , I know . It 's pretty rough on you after last night . Eileen meant a lot to you , didn 't she ? Look , why don 't I just head back ? I can hike it in a day . Why don 't you stick around till tomorrow , huh ? We 'll all go back . Okay ? All right . Okay . ( stammering ) Hey ... That 's how the boogaloo was invented . Boogaloo , Vern ? I never learned how . That was always part of your problem . Here 's something . The landing pods made these marks . Could be . Tire tracks . Automobile tire tracks . Hardly extraterrestrial . They unloaded something that looked like , uh , lockers . Lockers ? Well ... Somebody 's there . Sorry . Restricted area . Uh , we wanted to see the camp commander . No chance . Now , turn it around . One of your flying saucer people . Come on . ( loud humming ) ( humming intensifies ) ( humming stops ) ( machine fizzes ) ( thudding ) ( buzzing ) Search him . He hasn 't got it . He has to have it . Search him again ! Hal , cut it out . Hal , please . Listen ! She said cut it out . She means cut it out ! Now , Vern , that 's not going to help . Come on . That 's really sweet , big Vern . Jumping to the lady 's defense . You just keep forgetting that she doesn 't want you anymore . Hal , you stop goading him . Don 't you do that again . I 'll go ... get Dr. Devin . Where 's Dr. Devin ? Look , we got to get out of here right now . Well , tell us where he is . We 're in great danger . Let 's get into the truck . What have you done to Dr. Devin ? He 's dead . DAVID : The people from the flying saucer killed him . They 're on their way to get us now . We 've got to get into the truck . Now , you got about five seconds to tell us where he is , pal , and then we 're going to bust you all apart . I 've told you . One ... Look , I 'll tell you in the truck . Let 's go . Two ... ( vehicles approaching ) I 'm sorry . You 'll have to come with us . Why ? Who are you ? We 're from Camp Crowley . It 's about a mile from here . Camp commander wants to see you . SERGEANT : Shouldn 't take long . Come on . Everybody in the truck . Come on . Move out . Come on , you . Move it . Wait a second . I got to put this back on , all right ? All right , but speed it up . ( engine starting ) All right , come on . Let 's go ! You try that again , friend , and we 're going to war . Well ... isn 't this lovely ? None of the comforts of home . Ooh . Uh , you , uh ... obviously know what 's going on , and we obviously don 't . I think you 'd better tell us . I 've tried . Go ahead . We want to hear . ( sighs ) All right , your Dr. Devin is dead . They killed him . They 're not from the army . Devin called them flying saucer people- - from another planet . Look , why should we believe you ? Steve , if we had believed him , maybe we wouldn 't be here now . Please don 't lie to us . Is Dr. Devin really dead ? I 'm afraid so . Vern ... I 'm sorry about last night . EILEEN : I didn 't mean for it to happen . Didn 't you ? Maybe I did . If I did , I couldn 't help it . I don 't care what you do with Hal . That 's your business . Just not in front of me , okay ? Oh , cool it , Vern . Why don 't you just relax and keep being a good loser , huh ? STEVE : Well , I sure don 't know what this is all about . Are-are we prisoners , Vern ? Can the army do that ? I never heard of it . Look , I 'm sorry I threatened you out there a while ago . It 's nothing personal . That 's all right . What building was Dr. Devin killed in ? This building next door . How 'd you get in past all the guards ? There were no guards then . What were you doing in there ? Trying to find proof that they 're here . Find any ? Yes . Well , let 's see it . I hid it . That 's why they searched us and then brought us here . Why don 't you just ... give it back ? They 'd have no reason for keeping us alive . Well , you could tell us where it is . I think it 's better if you don 't know . Oh , it 's a gag or a stunt . People wouldn 't really do things like this . Nobody said they 're people . ( door opening ) I 'm Colonel Harris , Base Commander . Welcome to Shangri-La , Colonel . All right , I want to know why we were brought here and searched . Well , I 'm sorry for the inconvenience , but the reason for your being here is very simple . This is a secret military base , and yet you 've managed to come in here and steal a vital piece of equipment . Just what is missing ? A crystal . A circular-shaped crystal . Colonel ... Dr. Devin ... is ... is he ... ? He 's all right . He suffered a slight injury . He 's being treated in the infirmary . I 'd like to see him . Well , you will . Now , theft of government property is a very serious offense . If you return it , immediately ... we 'll forget that you took it . We 'd like to see Dr. Devin before we talk about the crystal . Don 't dictate terms to me ! Just return the crystal ! Or what ? Or I can 't guarantee anything . Give it to him , Vincent . Shut up . Which one of you is Vincent ? There are ways of finding out . I am . I am . I am . Take your time and play your games , gentlemen . I have as much time as you have . Colonel ... Well , that really puts me down . When I was in the army , I was pushed around by sergeants and corporals and everybody . And now that I 'm finally out ... I 'm still being pushed around . Yeah , well , this is really groovy , isn 't it ? Locked up in here with two squares and a freak and your ex-boyfriend . ( chuckling ) My ex-boyfriend has more cool than a lot of people I know . We don 't even know who you are . You don 't know who Colonel Harris is , either . And I know he can 't deliver Dr. Devin . Well , until he does , we 'll go along with you . Is that fair enough ? ( sighs ) Fair enough . From this moment on , you will see what I tell you to see and hear what I tell you to hear . In a few minutes , a man will enter your barracks . Listen to me closely , all six of you . I know the army , and they don 't have the right to lean on him . If he 's a thief ? If he 's a thief , they can arrest him , they can charge him , but they can 't bully him . And they can 't lock us up , either . Hello , everybody . You put us on , man ! Ow ! Now , you listen to me . I saw them kill Devin . Let him go . Let him go ! Now you give them back that crystal . No . Give it back , Vincent . If the army doesn 't make you , we will . I said no ! Don 't say that again . The Colonel knows you have it . Apparently , it 's vital to their project . No ! They 've been patient with you . You lied about the saucer , you-you lied about me dying . What do you want ? ( door opening ) Which one 's Vincent ? I am . Where is it ? Why is it so important ? Is it part of your equipment to cure your people ? I have it ; they don 't . Let them go . No . Right . Why not ? Yeah ... why can 't we go ? I 'll tell you why . This base is engaged in a project so vital that the lives of everyone in this country might depend on it . As commanding officer , it 's up to me to see that it doesn 't fail . The stakes are too high . It 's a terrible responsibility . I 'm sorry you 've forced me to this . If Mr. Vincent refuses to return the crystal ... you 'll be taken out , one by one ... and ... And what ? ! I must consider that at this moment , all seven of you are enemies of our country . You 'll be taken out and executed . Oh , no . You must be crazy . You don 't have authority to do that . I don 't believe it . Please ... please ... Please ... please don 't let him do this . Look , they don 't have it ! There 's no sense threatening them . I 'm threatening you , Vincent . I 'm going to execute these people one by one until you see the light . Guard ? Sergeant ... start with one of the men . You ... in the orange shirt . All right , hero , you first . Who are you ? Why are you doing this ? ! OFFICER : Detail , halt ! OFFICER : Ready ... aim ... fire ! ( crying ) They 're never going to let us go now , are they ? No . Still , I think you ought to tell them where it is . This way , one by one , they 're going to finish us off anyway . ( footfalls ) Where is it ? Truck ... in the air filter . Oh ... thank God . Oh , thank God it 's over . The whole truck- - seats , tires , engine , everything . That 's where I hid it . Who put the air filter back on ? VERN : Steve . They 'll never believe that . And so we die ... one by one . If they come through that door , they 'd better come through shooting . Hal ? Come on , Hal ! ( sniffling ) Those maniacs aren 't going to see me cry . They shoot me in here ... all right . Sure beats getting hanged in a public execution . Hanged ? Hanged , like Steve ! Wait a minute . I ... I didn 't see a hanging . I-I saw a pistol shot in the back of the head . What ? Eileen , how did Steve die ? What ? How did he die ? EILEEN : Firing squad . With rifles ? Yes . How many men ? Well , six , eight , maybe . What are you talking about ? They 're making us see what they want us to see . We 're being brainwashed . Let 's search this place . No . Listen , listen . Vincent has gotten one of us killed already . We shouldn 't listen to him anymore . It won 't hurt to look , Doctor . We should be talking to them ... without Vincent ! This is wrong ! Vincent . Don 't , d-d-don 't get into any more trouble . No . No . No ... Guard . They made us see all that . But how ? Our minds filled in the details . That 's why we each saw something different . Then Steve 's alive . Beautiful . For how long ? They destroyed it . I still don 't think they 're going to let us out of here without that crystal . And I think we should jump them when they come through the door , all right ? ( keys jangling ) Wait a minute . Where 'd you get this ? It 's a rock specimen . It 's the crystal , or what 's left of it . It 's broken . Well , we didn 't break it . That means they have to let us go . Well , don 't they ? No . I don 't think so . We know they 're here . ( footfalls ) All right , no more games , Mr. Vincent . This second , one of my people just died because they don 't have that crystal . Now it 's your turn . We 'd hoped to avoid killing this many of you but make no mistake about it , we will ... unless I get that crystal back now . All right , you win . I want these people released . What guarantee do I have that this isn 't another one of your maneuvers ? You have me . Lieutenant . These people are free to go . After you , Mr. Vincent . David ? Get out of here as fast as you can . Are they going to kill him ? You heard what he said . Let 's get out of here . Now , listen , pal ... Sorry . Lieutenant 's orders . I was standing back here and , uh ... I , uh , put it into one of these ventilator holes . ( flips switch ) Which one ? I think it was the first one . You wouldn 't have put it there . It would have broken when it hit the floor . Everything happened so fast . I don 't remember what happened to it . Where is it ? Where is it ? ! Hey ! Is this what you 're looking for ? Get in the truck ! Get out of here ! Get out of there ! I thought I told you to move out ! I forgot ! ( engine starts ) Thank you for coming . This , uh , is the place ? It was . They pulled out . Now , if I seem a little skeptical , Mr. Vincent ... I 'd be skeptical , too . But they were here . Maybe 20 of them , all in army uniforms . Miss Brahm , this was Camp Crowley . It was deactivated in 1947 . It 's been inspected regularly . Six people told you . Are you going to ignore all of them ? We 're not ignoring you , sir . We have your depositions , and they 'll go into the report . The search for Devin is still going on . We 're pretty thorough about these things . I only wish we had more to go on . Now , the lieutenant will take you back . I 'm sorry , David . Where do you go from here ? Well , they may need another hospital . At least this time , I 'll know what I 'm looking for . Don 't you ever get discouraged ? Yeah . Don 't you ? Not lately . NARRATOR : The army report will be thorough and painstaking but without proof , its conclusions will be negative . And David Vincent resumes his war against the high command of another army- - the army of alien invaders .

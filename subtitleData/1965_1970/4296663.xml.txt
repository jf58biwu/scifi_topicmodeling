 - [ Silenced Gunshot ] - [ Frequency Screeching ] [ Both Groaning ] [ Tony ] The Tunnel 's out of control ! [ Tony ] They 're killing us . ! You 're killing us . ! - [ Groaning ] - What 's the Tunnel trying to do ? They 're killing us ! [ Man On P.A. ] 1 0 : 30 security check . Number 21 22 , please respond . Dr. Alfred Stiles , respond . Dr. Alfred Stiles , Time Tunnel Control , respond . Red alert . ! All security personnel to your stations . ! [ Alarm Blaring ] He 's dead . This is a maximum security operation . Repeat . This is a maximum security operation and not a drill . - Seal all the exits . - Ray , look . General ! If you can hear me , help us ! The Tunnel 's out of control . ! You 're killing us ! We 're getting an oscillation effect . It 's tearing the boys to pieces . - Try to stabilize it . - I 'm trying to . I just can 't seem to - - Let me try , Ann . - All right . Stabilized . Psychological conditions stabilized . They 're all right . - [ Gunshots ] - Look out ! Down , everybody ! Cut him off ! . [ Gunshot ] - [ Ann ] General , I see him ! - Halt , or I 'll kill you ! - Ray ! - Give up ! - You don 't stand a chance . - Every exit is sealed off . Move back , or I 'll kill him ! Don 't ! You 'll lose Doug and Tony ! [ Tunnel Powering Up ] [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . [ Sighs ] Well , he escaped ... into time . Ann , activate scan . Let 's try to track him . Ray , this notation - It must 've been made by Dr. Stiles . Well , this gives us a time-and-location fix on Tony and Doug . As well as on the killer . Look . The Tunnel controls were fixed when he entered the Tunnel . Ray . We 've identified the killer as Raul Nimon . Came to work in the complex a year ago . - Why didn 't the security check turn him up ? - He had a perfect cover . - Sir ? - Yes , Jiggs ? Nimon 's security file shows he had " " leave of absence " papers effective at 2 400 hours tonight . Have you made a thorough search of his quarters ? Yes , sir . We found microfilm and instructions from his principals . - They 've been turned over to Decoding for interpretation . - Very good , Sergeant . Ray , I 've got them . They 're near Grand Canyon , Arizona . Time period : 1 547 . There 's a good chance that Nimon is in the same period and location . Do you suppose we can get through , tell them about Nimon ? - We can try , General . - [ Clears Throat ] You 'd better see these . Decode of Nimon 's instructions . Ray . We have to evacuate the complex . - Evacuate ? - According to this ... Nimon was to have hidden a small nuclear device somewhere in the complex . His orders were to destroy the Tunnel after completing his espionage . What about Doug and Tony ? We can 't just leave them out there . We 've got to think of the thousands of lives ... which will be lost if a bomb goes off . Sergeant , you said his furlough was to start at midnight ? - Yes , sir . - Well , then he - - He wouldn 't have set the bomb to go off until after that . - That 's right . - Start the evacuation . - No , General . Don 't you see ? Our only hope is for Doug and Tony to find Nimon ... and get him to tell where he hid the bomb . - He can 't be far from them . - Meanwhile , we can start our own search for the bomb . I can 't risk the lives of our personnel . General , ask for volunteers . - I 'm staying . - And so am I. What about all these people ? Ask them , General . May I have your attention , please ? We have information ... that a nuclear bomb has been planted somewhere in this complex . As yet , we don 't know its location or when it 's timed to go off . We hope to secure that information ... but it will require certain personnel ... to remain at their posts despite the danger . Any of you who choose to leave may do so now . Start the search . Try for contact . Visual is very unstable . - Can we make voice contact ? - We 'll try . Ann . All right , General . Doug ? Tony ? Can you hear me ? Yes , General , we hear you . Everything went haywire here . [ Tony ] What happened ? There 's been a bomb and timing device planted in the complex . One of our technicians - a man named Nimon . He 's a foreign agent . He killed Dr. Stiles and escaped through the Tunnel . We had a fix on you , so he might be somewhere near you . Well , what time period are we in ? We have you located at Grand Canyon , Arizona ... in the year 1 547 . Now find Nimon . Make him tell you where he has hidden the explosive . It 's our only chance . It 's our only chance too . If the Time Tunnel blows up , we 'll never get back . Talk about a needle in a haystack . He could be within a hundred yards of us , and we 'd never find him . What if we let him find us ? - What do you mean , draw him to us ? - Sure . - How ? - I don 't know . Smoke . Fire . We 're slipping out of phase . I can 't hold Nimon in that time period . - Gone . - They transferred him . I 'm still on Nimon , but he 's moved in time . Can you send Tony and Doug after him ? We can try , General . Get ready to transfer . - Whenever you 're ready . - On my signal . Now . Stand where you are . Do not move . This is a warning . Do not move , or you will be killed . You are under arrest . Follow . I want all nonessential personnel evacuated . - What about the bomb ? - 200 volunteers looking for it , sir . Good . The big question is , when is it timed to go off ? It was the general 's feeling it couldn 't be before midnight , when Nimon 's furlough began . Jiggs , is there any way ... in which he could reasonably have planned to leave before his furlough began ? No , sir . He couldn 't pass through the outer gate before then . He 'd also have to allow time to get out of the area ... and far enough away to avoid fallout . - Say , uh , about three hours ? - Yes , sir , that figures . Then the bomb is probably timed to go off around 3 : 00 a.m. Oh , I 'd say pretty close to it . - I want search reports every 1 5 minutes . - Yes , sir . - Any luck ? - Not since we lifted them out of the 1 6th century . - Any idea where they landed ? - Well , our fix was on Nimon . We advanced him in time , but I have no idea how far . All we can do is keep scanning and hope we pick them up again . They are workers . It is part of our city . It looks like an enormous beehive . Move on . [ Tone Chimes ] I am a member of the ultimate human society . In this society , I am a soldier . Has anyone else like us come here ? I will do the questioning . You may call me Vokar . What are your names ? Where do you come from ? - I 'm Douglas Phillips . - I 'm Anthony Newman . We came through time from the 20th century . You have arrived in the most glorious era of man 's existence . What year is this ? How do you reckon time ? Do not trouble yourself with these matters . You will be given suitable work and quarters . This audience is ended . The most glorious era in man 's existence . Some glory . Some era . Whatever the era , the question is , is Nimon here too ? [ Door Opening ] Who are you ? [ Female Voice ] I am Worker Z2 4A1 9 . What 's this ? - Food for two for the eight-day work periods . - Food ? It is the diet ordered by the masters . - It will sustain life and energy . - Who are the masters ? They are the rulers of this complex . They are all-wise . It is my purpose to serve them . Who else lives here besides the masters ? The workers and soldiers . Have you ever seen anyone that looked different ? Someone like us . One like you , dressed like you , has been among us for many years . Years ? That can 't be Nimon . Maybe we 've gone through a time warp . Where is this man ? - I am forbidden to speak about him . - Wait . You 've got to help us find him . - If we don 't , we 're in trouble . - What is " " trouble " ? It means something terrible will happen to people we love ... unless we find this man . - What is " " love " ? - Tony , she doesn 't relate to us in any way . She doesn 't relate to anything . Your parents . - Your father and mother - do you love them ? - What is " " mother " ? Well , you had to have parents . How were you born ? - Born ? You mean how I came to be ? - Yes . My genes were selected from the population control reservoir ... and treated by the masters to make me fit for my duties in the complex . Were the others in the complex treated the same way ? Yes , except for the masters . They were always the masters . They are all-wise . It is my purpose to serve them . They 're like bees . They work for the welfare of the hive . You know , before a bee 's eggs are hatched ... they 're treated to produce workers , soldiers or queens - just like these people . Come . A master has summoned you . - Nimon ! - Tony , watch it ! Nimon , tell us where you put the bomb . We 'll try to get word back . Take it easy . We 'll get to him . You 're familiar with these components ? Yes , we 've used this type of equipment before . So Master Worker Nimon informed me . Our good Nimon feels he 's overworked . Your good Nimon is a murderer . We are not concerned about crimes committed in other times and other places . You will reconcile your differences with Master Nimon and give him assistance . And what if we refuse ? Will they die , Magister ? They 've suffered pain , but they 're not damaged . Take them to their quarters . We will discuss this matter with them again . Perhaps we should kill them . They could be dangerous . For the present , they 're of some value . Use them as you will . Later on , we shall see . [ Tone Chimes ] What hit us ? A first-stage reminder of your purpose . - The magister was merciful . - Merciful ? I don 't understand about Nimon . How long has he been here ? He came to us 1 0 years ago . Then it was a time warp . He got here 1 0 years ahead of us . - He has won great favor with the masters . - Why ? Because he is building the mechanism for them . What mechanism ? For time travel ? You must not ask questions . Now I must go . - We 're going with you . - No , you cannot . - You are prisoners . - We like you . We don 't wanna see you hurt , so don 't try to stop us . - Come on , Tony . - No ! You will be injured . What are you talking about ? - A force field . - You cannot pass through it . But you do . How ? - I have a key . - [ Beeping ] You didn 't have to warn us . Why did you ? Because ... I like you . One more question before you go . Why do the masters want a time machine ? - It is important to them . - Why is it important ? It is necessary to spread the glory of our civilization throughout all time ... and bring new power to the masters . Now let me go . " " To spread the glory of our civilization . " If the ray gun and that force field ... are any indication of their weaponry ... they might succeed . They want us to help them help Nimon . [ Nimon ] You 'll cooperate if you know what 's good for you . What 's the matter ? No welcome for a man of your own time ? I wouldn 't do that . The punishment would be terrible . Let 's hear what he has to say , Tony . What are you getting out of all this , Nimon ? The joy of working for the masters . Don 't you realize the only escape from this place is through time ? That can be arranged as soon as our Time Tunnel gets a fix on us . Your Time Tunnel was blown to atoms almost a million years ago . That 's right , gentlemen . You are now in one million A.D ... . and I am the only one who can return you to your own time . Think about it . Wait . How do you know that your bomb 's exploded ? There was no time to find it . It was set to explode at 3 : 05 on the morning that I left . [ Tone Chimes ] I 've tried everything . I can 't locate them . What area have you been scanning ? Everything within a thousand years of the last fix . That break in the power system gave us a surge . - Try farther ahead . - How far ? - No limit . - What is it ? What 's the matter ? - We 're having trouble locating them . - We 've only got two hours ! Maybe less ! Too many lives are involved . We 'll abandon the complex in two hours . Ray , I 'm getting a response . You changed your minds and decided to work with me . - Only because we have to . - You 're very sensible . Now , as you can see , we will soon have our own Time Tunnel . - You 're making good use of your stolen formula . - I 'm a good technician . Nobody in our time recognized my talent . Someone thought enough of you to hire you as a spy . Oh , you know about that . But espionage is a profession unworthy of my ability . Here , I have found a truly advanced culture . If they 're so advanced , how is it they haven 't developed time travel by now ? In a million years , a thousand civilizations can rise and fall . Time travel was a lost art to them . What sort of period preceded this one ? We are not here for a lesson in history . I 'm conducting my first experiment today . You mean you 're using humans for an experiment ? Animals have been extinct for over 1 00,000 years . One makes do with whatever is available . Nimon , you can 't use her . Don 't upset yourselves . Her genes are defective . So one way or the other , she has to be destroyed . Why not in the name of science ? - You cold-blooded killer . - Vokar . You 've had one reminder . You know what it does . Don 't ask for more . - Watch . - [ Machine Whirring ] - Get out of here ! - [ Laser Fires ] After her . She must not get away . He is not harmed , only stunned . You 'd better keep in mind that I enjoy protection . Vokar 's sole duty is to see that nothing interferes with my work . Using her as a human guinea pig . We shouldn 't have tried it . She hasn 't a chance . Well , we couldn 't let them kill her . We 're gonna just have to forget about her , Tony . Our main target is Nimon right now . We have to find a way to get to him - and fast . - What 's stopping us ? Come on . - Tony , wait a minute ! Are you all right ? The force field - I forgot about it . The key that girl carried - If we could only figure out what principle it used . The field is obviously magnetic . It 'd have to be their version of a degaussing device . Well , the basic laws of physics haven 't changed , even in a million years . What can we work with ? [ Ray ] Tony . ! Doug . ! It 's Ray ! It couldn 't have exploded yet . [ Tony ] Go ahead . We hear you . We have you fixed in one million A.D. - Is Nimon in your time period ? - Yes . Have you learned anything about the bomb ? It 's set to go off at 3 : 05 a.m. your time . [ Kirk ] Where did Nimon hide it ? We don 't know yet . Can you transfer us ? We 're building up power to make a try . [ Tony ] Well , how long will it take ? - About 1 0 minutes , General . - About 1 0 minutes . - Can you get to Nimon ? - No . We 're locked in by a force field . You 've got to get out of that force field . Make him talk ! Can you pick all three of us up ? Tony , we 'll try a transfer , but I don 't know what time period you 'll be moved to . [ Doug ] It doesn 't matter . Anyplace is better than this . - [ Tony ] We 'll try to find him . Can you track us ? - Yes . We 've got to get through that force field . Well , all we need is a coil of wire and , uh , a wooden dowel . But wood - It 's probably not used anymore . Any kind of nonconductor would do . - I doubt that this is a conductor . - You 're probably right . Now all we need is something that is one . Everything around here seems to be made out of some kind of molded plastic . How about that light ? They probably use solar energy conducted by radio waves . A radio wave needs some kind of a receiver . Look . I 've never seen this kind of material before . Well , we 'll figure it out later . At least it 's a conductor . I hope so . Well , let 's hope it works . What are you doing here ? They 'll catch you for sure . You saved me . I have come to save you . Where 's Nimon ? We 're trying to find him . Still in the teleport room . I can show you a way to reach it past the guards . [ Beeping ] What do you want ? You could be killed for coming here . You tell us where you planted that bomb . [ Nimon ] Vokar . ! Where 's that bomb ? I 'll kill you myself ! . I have them . - Are we up to power to make the transfer ? - We need one more minute . - Vokar ! - We will soon be there ! - Tell us where you hid the bomb . - Vokar ! They 're breaking in . So help me , Nimon , either you tell me where that bomb is ... or you 'll die before the people in the Time Tunnel . All right . All right , I will . Ray , hurry ! Ann ? - Ready . - Ten seconds . Nine , eight ... seven , six ... five , four ... - three , two , one . - [ Tunnel Powering Up ] Zero . - No reaction . - Try it in series . Transferred . Tony and Doug are in limbo . - What about Nimon ? - Nimon too . - A fourth . There 's someone else too . - Are they together ? Yes , I think so . The transfer was simultaneous . - Almost simultaneous . - I 've lost them . No . I still have an indication . All three , and the fourth too . They 're going back in time . Back . Back . What ? - What 's wrong ? - I have an extra signal . Five people were transferred . They 've stopped . I have a time fix . One million . One million B.C. The Pliocene period . B.C. ? Why , that 's as far back in time as they were forward . - Ann , can 't you get a visual contact ? - I 'm trying . Well , if they don 't find out where that bomb is hidden within an hour ... we 're all as good as dead . [ Lightning Crashing ] I 've been clawing my way through this jungle for hours . They must 've seen the whole thing on telecontrol and switched us . But where ? This place is like some gigantic hothouse . Maybe it 's - Maybe it 's an island . Man , right now , I 'd settle for the Amazon as long as it was the 1 968 Amazon . [ Roaring ] - What - - Come on ! I 'd say we 've gone back a million years before our time . I hope the Tunnel transferred Nimon too . Well , Ann said they had enough power to transfer all three of us . But if we 've lost him , we 've lost our only chance to save the Tunnel . You know , Tony , we might be the only humans alive on Earth . Maybe Nimon might have come down right near us . Let 's hope so . Come on . [ Roaring ] [ Screeching ] You haven 't got time . Call off the search . - But Doug and Tony - - I 'm sorry . Evacuate all volunteer personnel to the shelters . Okay , guards , secure . All out , on the double ! [ Alarm Ringing ] - The rest of the complex will be clear in 1 0 minutes , sir . - Good . That was an order . All personnel out . That means you . I guess we 're all waiting for you to leave , sir ... and Dr. Swain and Dr. MacGregor . General , we 're getting a location . Yes , for all five of them . We 'd better keep moving . We gotta find Nimon . Help ! - Help . ! - It 's Nimon . Help me ! Help me ! Help me get out of here ! - If he dies , there 's no chance of saving the Tunnel . - I know . Please , help me get out of here ! Now , listen to me , Nimon . We 'll try to get you out of there . If we do , you 've gotta tell us where you hid that bomb ... or we 'll be stuck here for the rest of our lives . All right . I 'll tell you anything . Just get me out of here ! Ann , we 're losing it ! Give me your hand . I can 't get him up . [ Nimon ] Help . ! Get me out ofhere . ! Here . Tie this to that tree . Hurry up . Help me . All right , Nimon , now grab that vine . Easy now . All right . Easy . Easy ! I 've got him . Ann ! Swain , can you hear us ? We 've got Nimon ! We 're running out of time . I can 't . I 'm trying to locate them , but I can 't . Stabilize . You 've got them ! Tony , Doug , we have you ! - We 've got Nimon ! - All right . We 've only got a few minutes . Tell ' em where you hid the bomb . All right , all right . I 'll tell you where it is . It 's forbidden to speak except on command of the masters . You are all under arrest . I think we 've lost our last chance . - You 've got to tell us ! - Nimon , another word , and you die . Now , we will all go to the masters . The masters are two million years from here . And if he doesn 't tell us what we have to know ... we 'll all die right here . The masters will not permit it . They can 't do anything about it , Vokar . The masters can do anything ! Come . We must leave . How can we make him understand ? We can 't . He 's conditioned by a million years of heredity . - He 's still human . - His humanity was bred out of him , Doug . Move ! You fool ! Where do you think you 're taking us ? To where the masters expect us to be . - And where is that ? - It is that place where I arrived . Come ! [ Roaring ] Well , it 's time for all of us to go to the shelters . There 's no hope . - Jiggs , uh - - Yes , sir . All right , ladies and gentlemen , let 's go . Come on . Let 's go . Come on . Quickly , please . Come on . Let 's go on through here . Ann ? Ray ? No , General . Please . Five minutes . That 's cutting it to a hairline , but - [ Roaring ] Nimon ! Come back ! There are three studs on the barrel . Pressing the third one kills instantly . Why don 't you kill ? It is your right . - No man has a right to kill . - It would be better . I think I have broken my leg . I would rather be killed quickly than left here alone . I won 't leave you . I 'll help you , and we 'll find the others . Why are you doing this ? I am not your responsibility . No , but you are a man . Or at least you were many years ago . I do not understand . Well , let 's just say I don 't like the idea of leaving you here to die . What does it mean - to like ? It 's a feeling . A feeling that gives you pleasure . Come on . Let 's go . Vokar , it didn 't feel broken to me . I think it 's only a bad sprain . See if you can put some weight on it . Hang on . I think I can reach you . Zee ! [ Rumbling ] Doug , get back ! The ground 's giving way ! - You all right ? - A beehive . A giant beehive . Our city is patterned on the cells of these extinct insects . [ Buzzing ] Extinct ? Bees . A swarm of bees returning here to the hive . Ray , we only have three or four minutes left . I 'm getting a response . We 're locked on it . Activate ! Tony , Doug , do you hear us ? Yes , we hear you ! Did Nimon tell you where he planted the bomb ? We don 't have enough time . There 's only a few minutes left . Tell us ! You tell us where you put it ! Give him an answer . I like him . They 'll never find the bomb . But there 's a time fuse . It looks like an ordinary bus bar . Inside the phase synchronizer console ! [ Sighs ] Just made it . But will Tony and Doug ? - [ Buzzing Continues ] - What 's that awful sound ? Tony , Doug , we found it . The complex is safe . They 're caught in a giant beehive . We 've got to get them out now ! We can 't transfer them all at once . - Then split your transmissions . - Well , we can try . Now the second . Can you make a transfer for Nimon ? No . [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire Continues ] The American Civil War . Come on ! [ Explosion ] [ Dog Barking ] Fermo , Cesare . Fermo . All right , men , let 's get out of here ! You too ! Major , over here ! Help , Major ! We need a doctor . He 's beyond any hope this world can give him now . He 's dead .

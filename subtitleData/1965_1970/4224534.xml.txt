 [ Man ] And that completes my final report until we reach touchdown . We 're now on full automatic in the hands of the computers . I 've tucked my crew in for the long sleep ... and I 'll be joining them soon . In less than an hour , we 'll finish our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy . Six months in deep space , by our time , that is . According to Dr. Hasslein 's theory of time ... in a vehicle traveling nearly the speed of light ... the Earth has aged nearly 700 years since we left it ... while we 've aged hardly at all . Maybe so . This much is probably true . The men who sent us on this journey are long since dead and gone . You who are reading me now are a different breed . I hope a better one . I leave the 20th century with no regrets . But one more thing , if anybody 's listening , that is . Nothing scientific . It 's purely personal . But seen from out here ... everything seems different , time bends ... space is ... boundless . It squashes a man 's ego . I feel lonely . That 's about it . Tell me though — does man , that marvel of the universe ... that glorious paradox who sent me to the stars ... still make war against his brother ... keep his neighbor 's children starving ? [ Beeping ] [ Rocket Jets Blasting Loudly ] [ Rocket Accelerating ] [ Crashing Sound ] You all right ? Stewart ? Stewart — [ Loud Screeching ] We 're in the soup . She 's sinking . Dodge , read the atmosphere . Landon ! Get out a last signal ! What signal ? To Earth that we 've landed . The air 's okay . Blow the hatch before we lose all our power . - [ Flicking Switches ] - It 's no use . The power 's gone . Forget it . Abandon ship . - [ explosion ] - She 's sinking . Going ... going ... gone . Okay . We 're here to stay . Well , where are we ? Do you have any notions , Skipper ? We 're some 320 light-years from Earth ... on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion . Is that close enough for you ? - [ Landon ] Could be Bellatrix . - [ Dodge ] It 's too white for BelIatrix . You didn 't have time to read the tapes . So you really don 't know , do you ? What went wrong ? We weren 't programmed to land in the water . [ Dodge ] The question is not so much where we are , as when we are . [ Taylor ] All right , we 've had enough sleep to hold us a while . Let 's start earning all that back pay . Dodge , run your soil test . - Got your sensors ? - Right . - Geiger counter ? - Got it . [ Man ] Let 's see , one pistol ... twenty rounds ammo , a medical kit , camera , TX-9 . We 've got food and water enough for three days . How long is a day ? That 's a good question . Landon . Hey , Landon ! Join the expedition . Sorry . I was thinking about Stewart . - What do you suppose happened ? - Air leak . - She died in her sleep . - You don 't seem very cut up about it . It 's a little late for a wake . She 's been dead nearly a year . That means we 've been away from Earth for 1 8 months . Our time . You 've gone gray . Apart from that , you look pretty chipper for a man who 's 2,031 years old . I read the clocks . They bear out Hasslein 's hypothesis . We have been away from Earth for 2,000 years ... give or take a decade . Still can 't accept it , huh ? Time 's wiped out everything you ever knew . It 's all dust . Prove it . If we can 't get back , it 's still just a theory . It 's a fact , Landon . Buy it . You 'll sleep better . Nothing will grow here . There 's just a trace of carbohydrates . - All the nitrogen is locked into the nitrates . - No dangerous ionization ? No . Well , if there 's no life here ... we 've got just 72 hours to find it . That 's when the groceries run out . Let 's go . Which direction ? - That way . - Any particular reason ? None at all . Come on — [ Laughing ] [ Laughing Echoing ] [ Both Panting ] [ Thunderclaps ] [ Loud Rumbling ] - [ Panting ] - Everybody all right ? Water check . Eight ounces . It doesn 't add up . Thunder and lightning and no rain . Cloud cover at night , that strange luminosity , yet there 's no moon . If we could just get a fix . What would that tell you ? - I 've told you where you are and when you are . - All right , all right . You 're 300 light-years from your precious planet . Your loved ones are dead and forgotten for 20 centuries . Twenty centuries ! Even if you could get back ... they would think you were something that fell out of a tree . Ah , Taylor , quit riding him . There is just one reality left — we are here and it is now . You get ahold of that and hang on to it , or you might as well be dead . I 'm prepared to die . [ Chuckling ] He-He 's prepared to die . [ Laughing ] Doesn 't that make you misty ? Chalk up another victory for the human spirit . Clue me in on something , will you ? Why did you sign on for this trip ? You volunteered . Why ? Never mind . I 'll clue you in . You were the golden boy of the class of ' 72 . When they nominated you for the big one , you couldn 't turn it down ... not without losing your All-American image . Climb off , will you ? Oh , and the glory . Don 't forget that . There 's a life-size bronze statue of you standing out there somewhere . Oh , it 's probably turned green by now , nobody can read the nameplate . But never let it be said that we forget our heroes . Taylor , I 'm telling you to climb off my back . Hmm . And there 's one last item — immortality . You wanted to live forever , didn 't you ? Well , you damn near made it . Except for me and Dodge , you 've lived longer than anyone ever born . And with our lovely Lieutenant Stewart dead ... looks like you 're the last of the line . You got what you wanted , Tiger . How does it taste ? Okay , you read me well enough . - But why can 't I read you ? - Don 't bother . Dodge , there , he 's not like me at all , but he makes sense . He 'd walk naked into a live volcano ... if he thought he could learn something that no other man knew . But you — you 're no seeker . You 're negative . And I 'm not prepared to die . I 'd like to know why not . You thought life on Earth was meaningless . You despised people . So what 'd you do ? You ran out . No . No , it 's not like that , Landon . I 'm a seeker too . But my dreams aren 't like yours . I can 't help thinking somewhere in the universe ... there has to be something better than man . Has to be . Taylor , over here ! Life . Where there 's one , there 's another ... and another and another . Let 's find ' em . Skipper ! Look . - Scarecrows ? - Let 's see . [ Water Rushing ] To hell with the scarecrows . Yee-hoo ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! [ Sighs ] [ Yells ] Whoo ! Yea ! Yea ! Ah ! Taylor . Look at this . Taylor , look ! They didn 't leave much , did they ? Well , at least they haven 't tried to bite us . Blessed are the vegetarians . [ Taylor ] They look more or less human , but I think they 're mute . We got off at the wrong stop . You 're supposed to be the optimist , Landon . Look on the bright side . If this is the best they 've got around here ... in six months we 'll be running this planet . [ Howling ] [ Animal Grunting ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots ] - Smile . - [ Laughing ] [ Laughs ] Which one was wearing the strange clothes ? This one . - Will he live ? - I don 't know . This beast has lost a lot of blood . [ Sniffs ] - There 's no probe here . Find one . - Yes , sir . This place is dirty , Doctor . Doctor , these animals are dirty . They stink and they carry communicable diseases . Why aren 't they cleaned up before they 're brought here ? [ Female Ape ] You don 't sound happy in your work . [ Male Ape ] I 'm little more than a vet in this laboratory . You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius about me . I did . You know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees . But the quota system has been abolished . - You made it . Why can 't I ? - What do you mean " made it " ? I 'm an animal psychologist , that 's all . We have no authority . You do all right when it comes to getting space and equipment . That 's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value . The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here ... in studies of cerebral functions of these animals . They 're still dirty , Doctor . And their bite is septic . There , look at that . Hold his jaw . - Good morning , Dr. Zira . - Good morning , Julius . How 's our patient today ? No change . The minute you open the door , he goes into his act . [ RattIing Cage ] Well . And what do we want this morning ? Do we want something ? Come on , speak . Come on , speak . Do we want some sugar , old-timer ? Hmm ? You could get hurt doing that , Doctor . Oh , don 't be silly . He 's perfectly tame . Ah , they 're all tame until they take a chunk out of you . Well , Bright Eyes , is our throat feeling better ? [ Zira ] Still hurts , doesn 't it ? See , he keeps pretending he can talk . [ No Sound ] That Bright Eyes is remarkable . He keeps trying to form words . You know what they say — " Human see , human do . " Now what ? He seems to want something . [ Julius ] I 'd be careful , Doctor . What 'd I tell you ! Try that again and I 'll break your arm ! [ JuIius ] Good morning , Your Excellency . [ Zira ] Dr. Zaius . [ JuIius ] Good morning , sir . - Open up , please . - I 'm so glad you could come . Sir , he 's over here . Bright Eyes ... show him . Go ahead , do your trick . Speak . Go on , speak again . There ! Can you believe it ? Yes , amusing . A man acting like an ape . Dr. Zaius , I could swear he 's answering you . He has a definite gift for mimicry . It 's most unusual . He 's using that old blanket as clothing . I wonder how he 'd score on a Hopkins manual dexterity test ? - An animal ? - Look ! - He 's moving his fingers . - Only because he saw you moving yours . Oh , but perhaps he understood . Man has no understanding . He can be taught a few very simple tricks , nothing more . I 'm afraid I must disagree . According to my experiments — Dr. Zira , I must caution you . Experimental brain surgery on these creatures is one thing , and I 'm all in favor of it . But your behavioral studies are something else again . To suggest that we can learn anything about the simian nature ... from a study of man is sheer nonsense . Besides , man is a nuisance . He eats up his food supplies in the forest ... then migrates to our green belts and ravages our crops . The sooner he is exterminated , the better . It 's a question of simian survival . [ Ape ] Is this the one you wanted , Doctor ? [ Zira ] Ah , yes . Thank you . Bright Eyes , I 've got a present for you . [ Chuckling ] [ Zira ] Put her in with him . [ Sniffing ] [ Sniffing ] [ Sniffs ] [ Chuckles ] Cornelius , up here . - Do you have to work tonight ? - No . Neither do I. [ Chuckles ] - Oh , Cornelius . - [ Chuckles ] - There 's — There 's Bright Eyes . - Hmm ? The one I was telling you about . What 's so special about him ? Watch . Hello , Bright Eyes . How 's our throat today ? [ Cornelius Giggling ] - Look , she remembers ! - Remembers what ? - The blood transfusion . - Zira , really . You know they can 't - Hey . Hey , watch out . Here comes Number One . Something 's bothering him . He 's been prying around the lab for the last two days . - Shh , shh , shh . - Uh , good morning , Dr. Zaius . - You , uh , know my , uh — Dr. Cornelius , my fiancé . - Of course . The young ape with a shovel . I hear you 're planning another archaeological expedition . With the Academy 's approval , sir . - The project will require my support , of course . - I hope I may count on it , sir . Cornelius , a friendly warning . As you dig for artifacts , be sure you don 't bury your reputation . - Stop ! - [ Whistle Blowing ] Stop ! [ Whip Cracking ] [ Zira ] Stop ! You 've hurt him ! - Take him inside . - [ Whip Cracks ] Cornelius ? Cornelius , if you have a moment today ... I 'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail . Oh , certainly , sir . I 'll pick up my notes and I 'll come right over . I don 't understand these animal psychologists . What 's Dr. Zira trying to prove ? That man can be domesticated . [ Laughing ] - What happened ? - Oh , those fools and their torches ! - Do you have any ointment ? - I 'll see . I 'm sorry , Bright Eyes . julius ! I told you what you 'd get ! Julius , don 't , don 't , don 't . It doesn 't matter . [ Zira ] julius , don 't hurt him ! Julius ! Natural-born thieves , aren 't they ? Get me a collar and leash . - I 'm taking him out of here . - He 's vicious , Doctor . - Besides , it 's against the rules . - Do as I say ! You — You wouldn 't hurt me , would you ... Taylor ? [ Chuckles ] It 's a stunt . Ah , humans can 't write . Dear , you 're a scientist . Don 't you believe your own eyes ? Where did you learn to do this ? " Jefferson Public School . " " Fort Wayne , Indiana . " Back on that planet you say you came from ? Uh-huh . [ Chuckles ] Yes , yes . Maybe he is intelligent , but he 's also , uh , crazy . Cornelius . Cornelius , please . " Dodge was killed in the hunt . What happened to Landon ? " I don 't know . They fell out of the sky with you ? " Not fell , flew . " Flight is a scientific impossibility . And even if it weren 't , why fly ? Where would it get you ? " Do you have maps ? " Uh — [ Clears Throat ] We 're here . You were captured here . You fell into the water here ? You came ashore , marched across the desert ... mountains ... - many days and nights - - [ Sighs ] and reached the jungle . Out of the question . Cornelius , why do you insist on provoking him ? No creature can survive in the Forbidden Zone . I know . I 've been there . I 've seen it . " Then how do you account for me ? " I don 't . And I 'm not going to try . But what about your theory ? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it . Zira , do you want to get my head chopped off ? Don 't be foolish . If it 's true , they 'll have to accept it . [ Chuckles ] Oh , no , they won 't . - Oh . Cornelius has developed the most brilliant hypothesis - - But I 'm probably wrong . that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate , possibly man . In his trip to the Forbidden Zone ... he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time . - The evidence was very meager . - You didn 't think so then . That was before Dr. Zaius and half of the Academy said that my idea was heresy . How can scientific truth be heresy ? What if taylor is exactly the proof you needed ? A mutation ? A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape ? [ Bangs table ] Touchy , isn 't he ? Hmm . " I am not a missing link . " Well , if he were a missing link , the Sacred Scrolls wouldn 't be worth their parchment . Well , maybe they 're not . [ Chuckles ] Oh , no , thank you . I 'm not going to get into that battle . - Cornelius , show some strength . - Zira , listen to me ! Now we both have fine futures - marriage , stimulating careers . - I 'm up for a raise . - [ Door Opens ] [ Cornelius ] Dr. Zaius . Did you forget our appointment , Cornelius ? Oh , no , sir . I was , uh , Just collecting my notes . You know Dr. Maximus , of course , our Commissioner for Animal Affairs ? Yes , sir . It 's a pleasure to see you again . - What is that ? - A man , Dr. Maximus . I know it 's a man . And you know the rules - No animals allowed outside the compound ... and , most especially , not without a leash . Uh , yes , sir . But-But this , uh , creature is a — is a special case . Why special ? Um , we 're conducting a new experiment . Wouldn 't that more properly be done in your office ? - Yes , sir . - Guards , return this beast to the compound . What is this ? A toy . It floats on the air . - Zira . - Try it . Nonsense . [ Door Opening ] - What 's up , Lieutenant ? - We 're taking Number Four over to surgery in five minutes . - Have him ready . - How come ? The beast 's throat is nearly healed . It 's not his throat this time . The vet 's gonna geld him . [ Julius ] Dr. Zira won 't like it . She wants that pair to mate . These orders come from Dr. Zaius himself . There 's nothing she can do about it . [ Sighs ] [ Keys jangling ] If only you knew what they 're going to do . [ Chuckles ] Stay still now . Don 't give me any trouble . [ Screams ] [ Female Ape , Gasps ] [ Male Ape ] Weep if you must , but make an end of sorrow . He lives again . Yes , he has found peace in heaven . He was a model for us all . A gorilla to remember . Hunter , warrior ... defender of the Faith ... cherished husband , beloved father ... generous master . Yes . He was a font of simian kindness . The dear departed once said to me — " I never met an ape I didn 't like . " - Look ! It 's a man ! - [ Screams ] In Heaven 's name , get rid of that creature ! [ Male Ape ] Catch him ! - [ Male Ape # 2 ] Follow me ! This way ! - Catch him ! Catch him ! [ Apes Screaming , Shouting ] [ Screaming ] [ Whistle Blowing ] [ Whistle Blowing ] [ Screams ] Come on , Quintus . [ Both Scream ] [ Apes Scream ] [ Chattering ] - Go get him . - Taylor , why did you run away ? - Security police . - I 'm in charge of this man . No longer , madam . He 's now in the custody of the Ministry of science . Take your stinking paws off me , you damn dirty ape . No one will listen to me . Only you . You — [ Chuckles ] Nova . You Nova . No — Yeah , me Tarzan , you Jane . [ Grunts ] Wait ! What are you doing ? Leave her alone , damn you ! Where are you taking her — [ Grunts ] [ Chittering ] You — Where are you taking her ? [ Continues , Indistinct ] [ Chittering ] Damn you , you hairy scum ! Shut up , you freak ! - Julius , you — - I said shut up ! It 's a madhouse ! A madhouse ! [ Panting ] [ Exhales ] Now I don 't even have you . [ Chuckles ] Imagine me needing someone . Back on Earth I never did . Oh , there were women , lots of women . Lots of lovemaking , but no love . That was the kind of world we 'd made . So I left because there was no one to hold me there . Did I tell you about Stewart ? Now there was a lovely girl . The most precious cargo we brought along . She was to be the new Eve ... with our hot and eager help , of course . Probably just as well she didn 't make it this far . Do you love me , I wonder ? Can you love , I wonder ? Yeah . You 're not as smart as Stewart ... but you 're the only girl in town . Look at that . I — I taught you to smile . - [ Door Opening ] - [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Bars Rattling ] It 's been weeks . What happened ? - Where have you been ? Why didn 't you come see me ? - Shh ! - What is this ? - A hearing . - Be clever . Be quiet . - All rise ! - Be seated . - [ Gavel Banging Table ] This ad hoc tribunal of the National Academy is now in session . President of the Academy presiding . On my right , Dr. Maximus , Commissioner for animal Affairs . And on my left , Dr. Zaius , Minister of science and chief defender of the Faith . And appearing for the state , Dr. Honorious , Deputy Minister of Justice . [ Gavel Bangs On Table ] [ Sniffing ] Bailiff ! You had instructions to clean up the beast . All these rags he 's wearing give off a stench ... that 's offensive to the dignity of this tribunal . You may proceed , Dr. Honorious . By your leave , Mr. President , this tribunal ... has not yet defined the purpose for this inquiry . You asked for the opportunity to present your case . Surely you must know why you 're here . At the very least , this man has the right to know whether there 's a charge against him . Objection ! This exhibit is indeed a man . Therefore , he has no rights under Ape Law . Well , Dr. Zira , this is a man , is it not ? He is unlike any man you have ever seen , as we hope to prove . Answer the question , Dr. Zira . Is it a man ? Uh , sir , perhaps the question is the point at issue . Is he a man ? Is he a deviate or a freak of nature ? - Objection . - Sustained . Now , Dr. Zira , in all fairness , you must admit ... that the accused is a nonape and therefore has no rights under Ape Law . Then why is he called " the accused " ? Your Honors must think him guilty of something . Creature 's not being tried , he 's being disposed of . It is scientific heresy that is being tried here . Well put , Dr. Zaius . Let us warn our friends ... that they endanger their own careers by defending this animal . [ Taylor ] Then I 'll defend myself . Dr. Zira , would you tell ... Bright Eyes to be quiet ? - My name is Taylor — - Bailiff ! Silence the animal . Wait , let me — [ Grunts ] You may proceed , Mr. Prosecutor . Learned judges , my case is simple . It is based on our First Article of Faith . That the Almighty created the ape in his own image . That he gave him a soul and a mind . That he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle ... and made him the lord of the planet . These sacred truths are self-evident . The proper study of apes is apes . But certain young cynics have chosen to study man . Yes . Perverted scientists who advance an insidious theory called evolution . Come to the point , Dr. Honorious . The state charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen ... experimented on this wounded animal ... tampering with his brain and throat tissues ... - to produce a speaking monster . - That 's a lie ! - Mind your tongue , madam . - Did we create his mind , as well ? Not only can this man speak , he can think . He can reason . [ Scoffs ] That can reason ? With the tribunal 's permission , allow me to expose this hoax by direct examination . Proceed , Doctor , but do not turn this hearing into a farce . Tell the court , Bright Eyes , what is the Second Article of Faith ? I know nothing of your culture . I-I admit that . Of course he doesn 't know our culture because he cannot think . Tell us , why are all apes created equal ? - Some apes , it seems , are more equal than others . - Ridiculous . Tell us , Bright Eyes , why do men have no souls ? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain ? Huh ? [ Scoffs ] Read this for me . Since the defendant has been forbidden to speak in his own defense ... he requests that the , uh , following statement be read into the record . You , Dr. Cornelius . Read it . Yeah . [ Clears Throat ] " I have come to you ... " from a planet in a different solar system . " I am an explorer in space " — Stop right there . Let me see that paper . [ Chuckling ] It 's a joke ... in very poor taste . Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man ? Dr. Zira , you state here that a ship from outer space ... sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert . You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions ... - with him at the time of his capture . - That is his assertion . Mr. President , in addition to Bright Eyes ... I believe the prosecutor has reassembled ... all the surviving humans that were captured in the hunt . - That 's true , Dr. Zaius . - Very well . Then I suggest that we go take a look at them . [ taylor ] That 's him ! That 's Landon . - Which one ? - The tall one in the back . Do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures ? - With one them , yes . - Identify him then . Speak to him . Landon ? Landon ? Oh , they cut him . Did you know about this ? No . I swear . I never saw this man before . But they — You did it . You cut up his brain , you bloody baboon ! Stop him ! Take him inside ! Mr. President , a word of explanation . The human specimen you saw outside ... suffered a skull fracture in the course of the hunt . Two fine veterinary surgeons under my direction were able to save his life . But the beast could not speak , of course . Nor will he ever speak . You did that to him , damn you ! You cut out his memory ! You took his identity , and that 's what you want to do to me ! Bailiff , gag the animal ! Damn you ! [ Muffled Yelling ] May it please the tribunal , I for one grant you ... that this creature can not have come from another planet . But this much is certain . He does come from somewhere in the Forbidden Zone . He 's described the region to us and described it accurately , for ... I have been there . - You 've visited the Forbidden Zone ? - Yes , sir . A-A year ago - with the special permission of the Academy . He exceeded his orders . His travel permit was canceled immediately . Yes , sir , that is true . Thanks to you . But not before I discovered evidence ... of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written . Objection ! These remarks are profane and irrelevant . Sustained . Your archaeological theories have no bearing ... on the disposition of this creature . Let them talk , Mr. President . Let them talk . Sirs , our theories have a bearing on his identity . - [ President ] How so ? - Let us assume , as common sense dictates ... that the prisoner 's story is false . But if he did not come from another planet ... then surely he sprang from our own . Yes , sprang ! As an animal psychologist , I have found no physiological defect ... to explain why humans are mute . - Objection ! - Sustained ! [ Zira ] Their speech organs are adequate . The flaw lies not in anatomy , but in the brain . - [ Honorious ] Objection ! - Sustained ! Sustain all objections , but face the truth . Yes . Behold this marvel , this living paradox . This missing link in an evolutionary chain . Silence ! You go too far ! [ Zaius ] I think an indictment is in order . Yes , sir . The state charges Dr. Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this tribunal ... malicious mischief and scientific heresy . It 's so ordered . This tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here ... and in due course , render its verdict as to the proposed indictment ... and as to the disposition of the deviate in question . This hearing is adjourned . [ Zaius ] Wait outside . Well , the verdict is in . At the moment , your two simian friends ... and sponsors are free on bail . But they 'll soon be brought to trial for heresy . - What about me ? - [ Chuckles ] Your case was preordained . In a way , you did the state a service ... because you made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius . Now the tribunal has placed you in my custody ... for final disposition . - You realize what that means ? - No . EmascuIation , to begin with . Then experimental surgery on the speech centers — on the brain . Eventually , a kind of living death . However ... I have it in my power to grant a reprieve . That is why I summoned you here tonight . Tell me who and what you really are and where you came from ... and no veterinary shall touch you . I told you that at that hearing of yours . You lied ! - Where is your tribe ? - My tribe . [ Scoffs ] They live on another planet in another solar system . Even in your lies , some truth slips through . That mythical community you 're supposed to come from , Fort Wayne . - What about it ? - A fort ! Unconsciously , you chose a name that was belligerent . Where were you nurtured ? Then you don 't believe that prosecutor 's charge ... - that I 'm a monster created by Dr. Zira ? - Certainly not . Uh , you 're a mutant . That 's what Zira and Cornelius claim . You 're talking heresy , Doctor . - Hmph . Of course . - Well , suppose I am a mutant ? How can the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic ? Because you 're not unique . There 's the one you call Landon . - Oh , then you admit that — - I admit that where there 's one mutant ... there 's probably another and another and another — a whole nest of them . Where is your nest , Taylor ? - Where are your women ? - Thank you . Thank you for calling me Taylor , Dr. Zaius . I know who I am . But who are you ... and how in hell did this upside-down civilization get started ? [ Grunts ] You may well call it upside-down ... since you occupy its lowest level — and deservedly so . Our eastern desert has never been explored ... because we 've always assumed that life cannot exist there . Taylor , save yourself . Tell me , is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone ? [ Sighs ] I don 't know . If you 're trying to protect others of your kind , it 'll cost you your identity . I 'm not protecting anyone . This whole thing is insane . What have I done ? You are a menace . A walking pestilence . I do know who you are , taylor . I 'll give you just six hours to make a full confession . After that , I shall use surgery to obtain one . Guards ! All right , you can cut pieces out of me . You 've got the power . Return this creature to his cage . But you do it out of fear . Remember that ! Remember that ! Because you 're afraid of me ! What are you afraid of , Doctor ? [ Rattling Door ] - Are you Julius ? - Who are you ? I 'm from the office of Animal Affairs . That male is to be transferred to the zoo . At this hour ? Who says so ? Don 't they tell you anything ? The Antivivisectionist Society is up in arms . They 're gonna save this beast from those butchers in the lab . If he can speak , he belongs in the public zoo . But what 'll probably happen is that some money-mad grown-up will put him in a circus . - Then we 'll have to pay to see what rightfully — - Stop making speeches ... and show me the order . [ Paper Rustling ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] Ha , this order 's no good . It must be countersigned by Dr. Zaius . Grab him ! - Who are you ? - So you can talk . I 'm Dr. Zira 's nephew . This abduction was her idea . You 're not really going to the zoo . That 's just our story in case somebody stops us . Get me out of this . We 've gotta move fast . - She comes along too . - Zira doesn 't want your female . - I want her . - If you insist . - But I 'm not taking any orders . - All right . Come on . Let 's go . - I told you not to bring the other one ! - He wouldn 't leave her . Oh , all right . Come on ! - Here , put this on . Come on . - Don 't you have any clothes for me ? What do you expect , an ape 's new suit ? - This stuff stinks . - Well , so do you , like all men . Taylor , remember , all men look alike to most apes . So put it on and keep quiet , and we may just get away with this . Hurry ! Cornelius ! - How 'd it go ? - Hey ! Come on . Let me out of this . Well , Taylor , we 're all fugitives now . Do you have any weapons , any guns ? - The best . But we won 't need them . - I 'm glad to hear it . I want one anyway . Now look here , Taylor , I 'm in charge of this expedition . - Good for you . But you 're not in charge of me . - [ Cocks Gun ] Not anymore . I don 't plan to be caught again . As you wish . Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone . I 'll try for that . What about you ? Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy . Unless we can prove our theories , we don 't stand a chance of acquittal . You 're going back to the Forbidden Zone ? We 're going back to the diggings I worked at over a year ago . It 's a three-day ride across the desert ... and near the place where you claim you landed from that planet of yours . Still don 't believe me , do you ? It 's a long detour to Dead Lake . What would we find ? Nothing much . An empty rubber life raft . Maybe a little flag ... the emblem of my countrymen . The terrain around that lake is poisonous . There 's no fresh water , no vegetation , nothing . Anyway , I ought to thank you for saving me . You 'll be in trouble for that . We 've been in trouble since the moment we met you . - What 's she pointing at ? - This must be close to home for her . She knows it . Nova , no . Nova . Nova ! You can 't go there . It 's not safe . Nova . We better get started . If the mounted police pick up our trail , they 'll come this far at least . Right . Let 's get the water and provisions into the wagon . [ taylor ] Cornelius . Where does this river lead to ? It flows into a sea some miles from here . - That 's where we 'll find the diggings . - And beyond that ? I don 't know . You can 't ride along the shore at high tide ... and we had no boats on our last expedition . You never told me , why do you call this a Forbidden Zone ? No one knows . It 's an ancient taboo ... set forth in the Sacred Scrolls . The Lawgiver pronounced this whole area deadly . - Shouldn 't we be moving on ? - I 'm for that . There , do you like it ? Why did you do that , scrape off your hair ? In my world — when I left it — only kids your age wore beards . Beards ? I don 't go in for fads . Somehow ... it makes you look less intelligent . When will you show me what 's in that cave ? Right now , if you like . Cornelius ! - Lucius , don 't fire at them . - You 're all under arrest . If there 's any more shooting , Dr. Zaius , you 'll be the first to go . - You can count on it ! - Taylor , you are not in command here . - Put down that gun . - Shut up ! Very well . Lower your weapons . Tell them to pull back around the rocks . Out of range . Withdraw ! - How did you know we 'd come here ? - It wasn 't difficult . Only an apostate would flee to the Forbidden Zone . And only a fool would give a gun to an animal . I see you 've brought the female of your species . I didn 't realize that man could be monogamous . On this planet , it 's easy . I 'll ask you to reconsider the rash course you 've undertaken . If you 're convicted of heresy , the most you 'll get is two years . But , if you persist in pointing guns in my direction , you 'll hang for high treason . We never meant to be treasonous , sir . But up there in the face of that cliff , there is a vast cave ... and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts . I 've seen some of your fossils and artifacts . They 're worth — There 's your Minister of science ... honor-bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge . - Taylor , please ! - Except that he 's also chief defender of the Faith . There is no contradiction between faith and science . True science . - Are you willing to put that statement to the test ? - Taylor , I would much rather — Take it easy . You saved me from this fanatic . Maybe I can return the favor . What is your proposal ? When were those Sacred Scrolls of yours written ? - Twelve hundred years ago . - All right . Now , if they can prove those scrolls don 't tell the whole truth of your history ... if they can find some real evidence of another culture ... from some remote past , will you let them off ? - Of course . - Let 's go up to the cave . Sorry , Lucius , you 've got to stay here and guard the camp . Always giving orders , just like every other adult . Relax , you 'll get to see it all later on . Present your evidence , Cornelius . It was at this level that I discovered traces of an early ape creature — a stage of primitive barbarism , really , dating back some 1 , 300 years , roughly . It was at this level I discovered cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz ... and the fossilized bones of carnivorous gorillas . But the artifacts lying here ... were found at this level ... and date back , uh , 700 years earlier . That 's the paradox . For the more ancient culture is the more advanced . Now , admittedly , many of these objects are unidentified . But clearly , they were fashioned by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy . Indeed , the fact that many of these tools are unknown to us ... suggests a culture which , in certain ways , equals our own . Some of the evidence is uncontestable . Don 't speak to me in absolutes . The evidence is contestable . - I apologize , sir . - To begin with ... your methods of dating the past are crude , to say the least . There are geologists on my staff who 'd laugh at your speculations . - But there 's the doll , sir . - What ? Oh , uh , lying right there . The human doll . What does this prove ? My granddaughter plays with human dolls . The doll was found beside the jawbone of a man ... and no trace of simian fossil has been found in this deposit . Your conclusion is premature . Have you forgotten your scripture ? The 1 3th Scroll ? " And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden ... and chained him to a tree , and the children did make sport of him . " No , sir , I have not forgotten . Well , for a time , the ancients kept humans as household pets ... until our Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed . Keep digging , Cornelius . You 'll find evidence of the master of this house — an ape . - What are you doing ? - Reconstructing a past life . You say these things were found at the same level as that doll ? Whoever owned him must have been in pretty bad shape . He wore false teeth and eyeglasses . He had a failing heart . Towards the end he had this prefabricated valve put in it . I don 't say he was a man like I knew at home ... but he must have been a close relative because he had all the same weaknesses . He was a weak , fragile animal . But he was here before you , and he was better than you are . That 's lunacy . I can offer alternate descriptions ... of every one of those articles which is just as ingenious as yours . But it 'd be conjecture . Not proof . [ Doll ] Mommy . [ Doll ] Mommy . Dr. Zaius , would an ape make a human doll that talks ? - [ Gunshot ] - Lucius ! [ Gunshot ] You dirty - Nova ! [ Gunshots Continue ] - Nova ! - [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots ] [ Weakly ] Cornelius . Zira . Help me . [ Doll ] Mommy . I ought to kill you right now . Come on . You tell him to pull back now ! Cease fire ! Withdraw ! - Up there . - Withdraw ! Get down . Lucius , are you all right ? They took me by surprise . Sneaked up on me while I was feeding the horses . What 's happened to honor ? I got off two rounds to warn you . - They 've taken everything . - Not quite everything . They left a hostage behind . - How are you feeling ? - Disillusioned . - You can 't trust the older generation . - I know what you mean . I want you to go around the rocks and tell those gorillas ... - I 've got Dr. Zaius prisoner . - Yes , I can do that . I want a horse , food and water . Enough for a week for me and this female ... and 50 rounds of ammunition . - What if they won 't agree to your terms ? - Tell them I 'll shoot him . - Taylor , you can 't . - Ah , yes , he can . He 's a born killer . Deliver the message . Over here . Sit down . Taylor , please . Don 't treat him like that . - Why not ? - It 's humiliating . The way I was humiliated ... by all of you ? You led me around on a leash . That was different . We thought you were inferior . Now you know better . Cornelius was right , Doctor . He proved it . Man was here first . You owe him your science , your culture ... whatever civilization you 've got . Then answer me this . If man was superior , why didn 't he survive ? Wiped out by a plague . Some natural catastrophe , a storm of meteors . From the looks of some parts of this planet , I 'd say that was a fair bet . - But we can 't be sure . - He is . He knew all the time . Long before you found your caves , he knew . Defender of the Faith . Guardian of the Terrible Secret — - That 's it , isn 't it , Doctor ? - What I know of man was written long ago ... set down by the greatest ape of all , our Lawgiver . Cornelius , come here . Reach into my pocket . Read to him the 29th Scroll , sixth verse . " Beware the beast man , for he is the devil 's pawn . " Alone among God 's primates , he kills for sport ... " or lust or greed . " Yea , he will murder his brother to possess his brother 's land . " Let him not breed in great numbers ... " for he will make a desert of his home and yours . " Shun him . Drive him back into his jungle lair ... for he is the harbinger of death . " I found nothing in the cave to alter that conception of man ... and I still live by its injunction . [ Taylor ] That 's far enough . They think you 're behaving foolishly . I must say I agree . Where will you go ? To start with , I 'll follow the shoreline and my nose . But suppose you find nothing but wasteland ? How will you survive ? He won 't survive . Nova . How ' bout coming along ? - We can 't . - It 's better than going to jail for heresy . Oh , they can 't convict us of heresy . You 've helped prove our innocence . Besides , his culture is our culture . Well , good luck then . Lucius . I still say you 're making a mistake . - That 's the spirit . Keep ' em flying . - What ? The flags of discontent . Remember , never trust anybody over 30 . Doctor , I 'd like to kiss you good-bye . All right , but ... you 're so damned ugly . Don 't try to follow us . I 'm pretty handy with this . Of that I 'm sure . All my life I 've awaited your coming ... and dreaded it , like death itself . Why ? I 've terrified you from the first , Doctor . I still do . You 're afraid of me and you hate me . Why ? Because you 're a man . And you 're right , I have always known about man . From the evidence , I believe his wisdom ... must walk hand in hand with his idiocy . His emotions must rule his brain . He must be a warlike creature who gives battle to everything around him — even himself . What evidence ? There were no weapons in that cave . The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise . Your breed made a desert of it ages ago . It still doesn 't give me the " why . " A planet where apes evolved from men ? - There 's gotta be an answer . - Don 't look for it , Taylor . You may not like what you find . Untie me ! No , no , no . Wait ! Wait ! Let him go . Lieutenant , fetch our explosives . - We 're going to seal up the cave . - Yes , sir . - Seal the cave ? - That is correct , and you will both stand trial for heresy . - But the proof , the doll . - In a few minutes , there will be no doll . There can 't be . I 'm sorry . Dr. Zaius . Dr. Zaius , you mustn 't . You promised . What I do , I do with no pleasure . Silence him . Doctor . Dr. Zaius , this is inexcusable ! Why must knowledge stand still ? What about the future ? I may just have saved it for you . What will he find out there , Doctor ? His destiny . Oh , my God ! I 'm back . I 'm home . All the time , it was — We finally , really did it . You maniacs ! You blew it up ! Oh , damn you ! God damn you all to hell !

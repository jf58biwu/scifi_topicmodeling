 [ PROJECTOR WHIRRING ] WEATHERMAN [ OVER TV ] : The hurricane hit Miami at 11 : 45 then moved west . There was no way of predicting it , no way of charting it 's course . It just happened . It just happened and 26 people are already dead . And now I 'd like to show you something really weird . This shot was made from our weather plane in the eye of the hurricane . [ TV CLICKS OFF ] This was taken at approximately 2 : 30 yesterday afternoon , Dr. Gantley , when the storm was at its peak . GANTLEY : What 's the registry on that boat ? The Lydia J out of St. Mathew Beach . Something wrong , Dr. Gantley ? You don 't see it ? None of you see it . A boat miraculously survives a hurricane . A town miraculously survives a hurricane . The boat just happens to be from that town . Cut the film . [ WHIRRING STOPS ] Doctor . Don 't you think you 're reading something into this that 's less than- - Less than scientific ? You tell me how a hurricane of this kind occurs in the middle of February . You explain a storm that violated every law of nature . Father Corelli , please . Yes , it 's very important . Father , this is Ed Gantley . Yes , I just heard you were in town . Look , are you , by in any chance , going back to St. Matthew Beach tonight ? Do you mind if an old friend rides along with you ? Fine . Well , I can be ready as soon as you are . Uh-huh . Why don 't I meet you down at emergency station . GANTLEY : Good . Goodbye , father . [ HANGS UP PHONE ] [ SIREN WAILING ] [ AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] [ TREE CREAKING ] Ed . Ed , Ed , are you all right ? - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Yes , I 'm all right . - Want to go inside , see a doctor ? - No , no . Did you see it happen ? - It must be the wind . - Yeah . Do me a favour , huh ? - Next time , let 's meet at a bar . - Okay , come on . [ ANNOUNCER READING ON-SCREEN TEXT ] ANNOUNCER : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . NARRATOR : The invaders : alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination : the Earth . Their purpose : to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road , looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . [ WHINING SOUND ] Now , David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . ANNOUNCER : The guest stars in tonight 's story : Joseph Campanella , Barbara Luna . [ ANNOUNCER READING ON-SCREEN TEXT ] NARRATOR : In the nightmare world in which David Vincent moves , there is seldom reason or logic . And so a hurricane that occurs out of season , that blankets a 600 mile area , yet spares a single town . Such a storm becomes a part of that nightmare world . And prompts a phone call to a meteorologist named Gantley . And brings Vincent to a fishing town near the Florida Keys . May I help you ? - I 'd like a room . - Sure . Just passing through ? I 'm looking for Dr. Gantley . What room is he in ? Room six . But he 's not in . Where can I find him ? Just a second . Luis . Yeah ? Any idea where Dr. Gantley went this morning ? He 's in one of my boats out on the water . Well , is there any way I can I get out there ? I have to see him , it 's important . Sorry , if you wanna see him , he 'll be at Father Joe 's around lunch time . - Where 's that ? - Other side of town . Easy to find . Alongside the church . Oh , okay. thank you . Bar 's in there . Can I see my room ? - Thank you . - Yeah . [ GASPING ] [ GRUNTS ] [ MOTOR REVVING ] Lisa , has Dr. Gantley called yet ? - Lisa ? - Hmm ? Has Dr. Gantley called ? He 's late . Oh , no . No , he hasn 't , Father . - Is there something wrong , Lisa ? - I 'd better finish setting the table . - Lisa ? - There 's nothing wrong , Father . I 'm just a little tired , that 's all . - Just a little tired ? - Mm-hm . Look , Lisa , don 't you think it 's time you told me the truth ? You 're not just tired . You 're tense , you 're on edge . You 've been that way for a couple of weeks now . Are you afraid of something ? I 'm all right , Father . - Really . - Look , would you like to go away for a couple of weeks ? I 'll scrape together the money somehow , but I don 't want you getting sick . I promise I 'll take better care of myself . I promise I 'll take better care of myself . I- - [ DOORBELL RINGS ] I 'll get it . Hello . My name is Vincent . I 'm looking for Dr. Gantley . I understand he 's having lunch here today . Yes . I was expecting him half an hour ago . - Would you like to come in and wait ? - Thank you . [ PHONE RINGS ] - I 'm Father Corelli . LISA : Hello ? Are you working with Dr. Gantley ? No , not exactly . We 've talked on the phone . - I see . - Excuse me . It 's for you , father . Oh , excuse me . Hello . Yes , Luis . What ? FATHER JOE : Are you sure ? Yeah . Yes . I 'll be there in a few minutes . What is it , Father ? He said Gantley is dead . They found his boat adrift just south of here . - How did it happen ? - Ed Gantley . - Was it an accident ? - We were kids . Father , was it an accident ? Cerebral haemorrhage . I 've got to go . I know this is the bad time , but I 've got to talk to you about Gantley . Later . Did he ever discuss his job here , his work ? I 'm sorry , I have no time . Father , he told me something about that hurricane . And I have to know what he found out . I 'm sorry , I can 't help you , Mr. Vincent . Whatever he found out , he kept to himself . Excuse me , if you 'd like to wait for me , I 'll be back in an hour . Lisa , please offer Mr. Vincent some tea or coffee . See that he 's comfortable . [ DOOR CLOSES ] Lisa . Did Dr. Gantley leave any papers here or reports of any kind ? No , not that I can think of . Well , you might check his room at the inn . I 'll do that , thank you . Mr. Vincent . - Did you know him very well ? - No . Well , he was a very strange man . He was always kidding Father Joe about religion . And yet he spent hours in that church . Almost every day . Thank you .

Concussions can have some pretty nasty after effects . Will you stop by later ? Can 't , Mrs. Hogan 's baby is due . I 'll be there all afternoon . Yeah . Well , thanks , Wally . Father . Father . I 'm sorry I wasn 't able to do anything for Dr. Gantley . I know you were very close . [ ENGINE STARTS ] [ WHIRRING ] [ POWER ACTIVATING ] [ BEEPING ] WALLY : Luis . Luis . Hello , doctor . Why is everything so quiet ? I hope we 're not in for another storm . I sure hope not , doctor . [ ENGINE STARTS ] Lisa , why don 't you make Mr. Vincent some fresh tea ? Father . I hope he 's going to be all right . You know , before you got here with the doctor , he was saying such strange things . Well , crazy things . Like he was out of his mind . He won 't be himself for a while . I 'm sure after a few days rest . Well , don 't worry about it . - Here , let me wet that for you . - No , it 's all right . Father , please , you 've got to help me look around that church . - What ? - Oh . Mr. Vincent , why do you wanna look around the church ? Dr. Gantley spent a lot of time there . Maybe that makes sense to you . What was Gantley doing on the water this morning ? - What was he looking for ? - The Lydia J. FATHER JOE : A fishing boat caught in the eye of the hurricane last week . It ignored three separate warnings from the Coast Guard to make port . I guess Dr. Gantley wanted to find out why . Who owns that boat ? Luis Perez . You know him ? We met this morning . How long he has been here ? FATHER JOE : Oh . Almost a year , I believe . And how long have you been pastor here ? Heh . Three months . Mr. Vincent , I 'm a fairly bright man . But I haven 't the foggiest notion of what you 're driving at . Or what 's driving you . Oh . Your tea , Mr. Vincent . Please , put it over there , Lisa . [ SIGHS ] - Father- - - Mr. Vincent , some tea will do you good . Please , help me to the church . Please , Mr. Vincent , drink your tea . There . Come on , Lisa , Let 's leave Mr. Vincent alone . Yes , Father . The barometer 's falling again . Father , wait . [ GROANS SOFTLY ] You wanted an explanation . I 'll give it to you . - Mr. Vincent , please , stay in bed . - Listen to me , please . If I told you Gantley was murdered . Murdered because of something he found in your church . Something to do with those hurricanes . You 'd say I was insane . But if I am , why did they try to kill me when I entered your church ? They ? Who are they , Mr. Vincent ? Beings from another planet . I know what that sounds like , but that 's what they are . Beings from another planet , dedicated to our destruction , Father . That hurricane last week , it was aimed directly up the coast . It could have hit every big city from here to Washington . And now another hurricane is coming . These beings , what do they look like ? Like us . Just like us . Except some of them have a deformity of the hands . [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] Now , you know why I didn 't said anything to police . They 'd never believed me . Mr. Vincent , I 'm gonna insist that you stay in this bed . I insist that you rest . As long as you 're in this house , you 're in my care . And I am going to be obeyed . By tonight , you 'll be feeling better . We 'll talk about it then . [ DOOR CLOSES ] Lisa , I 'm going over to the inn . All right . I 'm worried about Mr. Vincent . I don 't like the idea of your being all alone here . Oh , please , don 't worry . Please . All right . You can reach me at the inn if you need me . [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ POWER ACTIVATING ] [ WHINING SOUND ] [ BEEPING ] [ MOTOR STARTS ] [ THUNDER RUMBLING , DEVICE FIRING ] [ BEEPING ] [ DEVICE FIRING ] [ CLOCK TICKING ] [ BELL RINGING ] [ CUP FALLS ] [ NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] [ DIAL TONE HUMMING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] Luis , any more reports on the storm ? This time we 're not gonna be so lucky , Father . It 's gonna hit here tonight and worse than the one that hit Tampa . Let 's set my table up over there . Wally , I 've got to talk to you about Vincent . That 's too small . I 'll need at least two of those stuck together . What about him , Father ? Look , doctor , if I told you he thinks these hurricanes are manufactured by beings from another planet , what would you say ? [ SCOFFS ] - You 're kidding . - No , I 'm not . And I 'm convinced he believes it . Look , Wally , you 've gotta look at him , please . Father , I can 't leave here now . And there 's darned little I could do for him here anyway . The best thing is drive him into Tampa , to the hospital . Take somebody with you . You better get started before the storm hits . - We 'll come with you , Father . - I 'll get a couple of men , Father . Fine , thanks . Let me call Lisa , tell here we 're coming . [ DIALLING ] What 's wrong , Father ? Directory phone is dead . David . You 've had a bad fall . Here , drink this . That man I saw you talking to just before I passed out- - Please , drink this . Lisa , that man ... There was no man . He 's one of the men who attacked me in that church . You get the police on the phone now . But David , there was no man . I 've been all alone . You 've been imagining things . Here . This will make you feel better . I saw that man . David , you have to drink the water . - No . - David . No . [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] Sooner or later you 're going to have to drink or eat something . I can wait . They put you here , didn 't they ? I 'm not gonna drink . I 'm not gonna be driven insane . Only the first effects are like insanity . After another glass or two , it 'll become more like a dream . And what happens to Washington , New York , Boston ? It 's just the beginning , isn 't it ? Next time it 'll be other cities . Very soon the whole world . Why worry about it ? And what happens to Father Joe ? Oh , we wouldn 't hurt him . He 's been very good camouflage for us ever since he came here and started to rebuild our church . Your church ? Four months ago it was empty . Abandoned . So , Luis and I took it . I 'm getting very impatient with you , David . Now , drink this . Drink it . David . David , stop it . David ! [ LISA GRUNTS ] [ DOOR OPENS ] [ SOBBING ] What in God 's name have you done ? Lisa , what is it ? What happened ? Tell me , tell me . LISA : No , Father , please . - Lisa , what happened ? Father , please , don 't make me say it . You damnable . My God . I 'm sorry I hit you . You 're a sick man . Do you have anything to say , Mr. Vincent ? Well ? No , Father . Very well . John , take my car . Drive him to the sheriff 's substation up the road . - Let them take him to Tampa . - Yes , Father . [ CRYING ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] Lisa , are you all right ? Father , I was so frightened . I 'm sorry , Lisa , it 's all my fault . I should never have left you alone here with him . [ ENGINE STARTS ] [ WHIRRING ] Hey , Danny , what 's wrong ? Road 's blocked ahead . You can 't get through . But we got to . We got to get this man to the hospital . Hey , aren 't you the fellow who was beat up at the church ? These men are gonna kill me . He 's sick , Danny , really sick . But you saw what happened to me in the church . Did I make that up ? Father Joe said to take him to the hospital because he 's sick . You can check with him if you want it . Look , Mr. Vincent , I know each of these men . They wouldn 't wanna hurt you or nobody . Look , why take a chance ? If I am sick , take me to a hospital . You take me . VINCENT : Let them decide . Come on . Oh , Danny . That guy went berserk in Father Joe 's house . He might do it again . That 's what I get paid for . Come on . [ SIREN WAILING ] I 'm ready , Father . Here , take this . Go straight to the inn . You 'll be safer there . Aren 't you coming ? I 'll be along in a few minutes . I wanna go to church first . What for ? Something I wanna do . But , Father , the wind is much worse and if we don 't leave now we won 't get to the inn at all . I 'll be along in a minute . I want to say a prayer for Mr. Vincent . No , I wanna pray for my own forgiveness . I treated him very badly , Lisa . Father , you were more than fair with him . Anybody else would have beaten him , really beaten him . No , I 'm not fair , Lisa . I 'm a hypocrite . It 's very easy to go along and say , " I love all of God 's children . I 'll return evil with love . " And finally , I 'm confronted by the evil act of a sick man , I strike him in rage and hate . Lisa , for a moment , I wanted to kill him . Any man would 've felt the same way . I am not any man . - I better run along . - Father , I 'll come with you to the church . I 'm afraid to go to the inn by myself . Very well . Sergeant , you 're gonna need another man at the road block . I 've got a sick man- - Hey . [ TYRES SQUEALING ] Luis . What is going on here ? What is all this ? How did it get- - I 'm sorry , Father . I tried to keep you from coming here . Keep me from- - Please sit down , Father . [ WHIRRING INTENSIFIES ] Mr. Vincent was right . He was telling the truth all along . But why me ? Why my church ? Why did you seek me out ? Who would search an abandoned church ? And as for seeking you out , it 's very simple . Lisa was put in your house to watch you . LUIS : To make very sure you 'd never find anything out . And if I did ? To kill you . Mm-hm . [ GROANS SOFTLY ] Sit down , Father . [ PRAYING SILENTLY ] [ TYRES SCREECH ] When will I die ? When Luis is through . [ THUNDER RUMBLING , DEVICE FIRING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Did you include me in your prayers , Father ? Does my question surprise you ? My prayers were for you . FATHER JOE : For the forgiveness of your eternal soul . Yours and theirs . LISA : And what of your own soul ? No prayers for that ? Or aren 't you afraid to die ? When I became a priest , I took upon myself the pall of death . Giving up all so that I might gain all for God . Behind you . Stop it . All of you . Go back there . Go on . FATHER JOE : Are you all right ? VINCENT : Yes . Just watch them . FATHER JOE : Look at- - Stop it . [ SOUND OF EXPLOSION ] Stop . Well ? Why don 't you pull the trigger ? Stop or I will shoot . I don 't think so , Father . I will . I will . Whatever lives is a child of God . Isn 't that what your religion preaches , Father ? Don 't listen to her , Father . Use it . Priest or hypocrite . Which are you ? I think I know which , priest . FATHER JOE : No . Your taxi 's here waiting outside . Thank you . Any news about Luis ' fishing boat ? No . No . Lost in the storm . Maybe in few days , some evidence will wash up on the beach . I doubt it , Father . They always disappear . Anyway , thank you for talking to the sheriff . One thing I don 't understand , why would they let the hurricane hit here this time ? Why would they endanger themselves ? I don 't know . After their experience with Dr. Gantley , I suppose they were afraid if another hurricane bypassed St. Matthew Beach it will arouse more curiosity . David , I 'm sorry your search had to end like this . But I couldn 't let you kill last night . Not as a priest . I understand . I 'll pray for your success , David . I 'll pray for us all . Thank you . [ DOOR CLOSES ] NARRATOR : Two men , two searchers . The one , searching heaven and Earth . The other searching in the corridors of the human conscience . The search continues .

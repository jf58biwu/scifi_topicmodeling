 ( Thunder ) ( Six ) ´ Where am I ? ´ ( Two ) ´ In The Village . ´ ( Six ) ´ What do you want ? ´ ( Two ) ´ Information . ´ ( Six ) ´ Whose side are you on ? ´ ( Two ) ´ That would be telling . ´ We want information ... ´ information ... ´ information . ´ ( Six ) ´ You won ´ t get it . ´ By hook or by crook ... we will . ( Six ) ´ Who are you ? ´ ´ Number Two . ´ ( Six ) ´ Who is Number One ? ´ ´ You are Number Six . ´ ( Six ) ´ I am not a number , I am a free man ! ´ ( Number Two laughs ) ( Applause ) - Busy , Potter ? - It ´ s our form of Siberia . - What was the Colonel up to ? - Dr Schnipps , crazy scientist . He ´ s got a rocket to destroy London . - Where ? - I don ´ t know . ( Buzzer ) Excuse me . Ridiculous . - Yes . - Where do I start ? Go to Magnum record shop , booth seven . The Chief will speak to you . Chin up , Potter . It was so damned unsporting . It wasn ´ t cricket . Keep the change . ( Loud rock music ) ( Chief ) ´ Mission - find and destroy Schnipp ´ s rocket , ´ but I can ´ t help much - the opposition is one step ahead . ´ - Thanks ( ! ) - ´ What was that ? ´ - Nothing . - ´ Take over from the Colonel . ´ ( Gasps ) - The usual , sir ? - Please , Doris . Thank you . - Same again , sir ? - No . One of those is quite enough . Brandy . Whisky , vodka , Drambuie . Tia Maria , Cointreau , Grand Marnier . Sir , you ´ ll make yourself sick . ( Sniggers ) ( Hums ) What a brave loser ! One of the many in this year ´ s heavy weight title , ladies and gentlemen . Those are the sort of fights you don ´ t see in the big clubs . And now , for the first time ever in this country , at 210lbs , the Polish giant , Killer Karminski ! ( Applause and boos ) Let ´ s hear it for the gallant opponent , who will go three rounds with the Killer , a man of mystery , in the front row , Mr X ! ( Cheers ) ( Old woman ´ s voice ) Good luck , young man . Killer Karminski ! ( Cheers and boos ) Mr X ! ( Cheers ) I want a good clean fight . No kicking , butting or gouging , except in moderation . May the best man win . Back to your corners . Seconds out , round one ! ( Bell ) Take it easy , me face is me fortune . You might knock it back into shape . Break ! - Go to the tunnel of love . - The what ? The tunnel of love . ( Grunts ) Who ... gave ... you ... the ... message ? A lady . - Who ? - I don ´ t know . - Who was she ? - Didn ´ t I tell ya ? I don ´ t know ! The tunnel of love . ( Woman ´ s voice ) ´ Hello . Don ´ t turn round , you ´ re covered . ´ The tunnel of love is fitting ´ because I ´ m beginning to love you in my way . ´ I ´ ve been looking for a worthy opponent ´ and you ´ ve passed my first tests brilliantly . ´ You will be hearing from me again . Auf Wiedersehen ! ´ ( Laughter ) ( Screaming ) What ´ s your game , Sherlock ? I ´ ll spread your nose all over your face . I ´ ll tear off your leg and beat you over the head with it . I love you madly . ´ I love the way your hair curls on the back of your neck . ´ You ´ ll make a beautiful corpse . ´ I ´ m going to do you the honour of letting you die ... superbly . ( Revs up ) But not yet , darling . There ´ s more fun to come . ( Woman ´ s voice ) ´ I ´ m glad you came . ´ This is to be our love tryst . ´ You may not see my face , but you may know my name . ´ My name ... is Death . ´ I ´ m sorry my father couldn ´ t be here to greet you . ´ He ´ s busy with his rocket . Besides , he didn ´ t wish to play gooseberry . ´ You are a born survivor , I am a born killer . ´ We were made for each other , but I fear this is where it must end . ´ Your reflexes can ´ t save you now . ´ It will come suddenly , when your luck runs out ... ´ with my love . ´ Come , come inside , my darling . ´ Is your heart pounding ? Your hands shaking ? That ´ s love , my darling . ´ My father was a great man , but the war ended before he was recognised . ´ But when London lies in ruins , he will be a god . ´ Nice of you to drop in . I can see you ´ re having a swinging time . ´ But that ´ s not quite what I had in mind . Perhaps this will help . ´ You ´ ll soon get the point . ´ Incidentally , they ´ re electrified . ´ Ingenious . ´ Nobody ´ s ever thought of that before . ´ You ´ re really the most entertaining lover I ´ ve ever had . ´ That was ill-mannered and dangerous . ´ I might not have been able to warn you the floor is mined - ´ small , sensitive , and quite deadly . ´ Oh , I almost forgot , they will all explode anyway in 90 seconds . ´ That ´ s the hot line , or had you noticed ? ´ On from the butcher ´ s and baker ´ s into the candlestick maker ´ s , ´ only he never made candles like these . ´ They have a cyanide derivative mixed with wax . ´ As the wax burns , it gives off cyanide . ´ Every candle is breathing poison into the air . ´ I do so believe in double glazing , don ´ t you ? It keeps out the noise . ´ Of course , it does keep out the air , too . ´ A word of advice : if the candles are blown out , they explode . ´ And that ´ s only one of the little ones ! ´ I warned you your luck would run out . I ´ m glad it ´ s to be this way . ´ I hate quick farewells , don ´ t you ? ´ Interesting . ´ Mice get Just as irrational when they ´ re about to die . ´ Here , when a great man was dying , they sounded the death knell . ´ I think that was a charming idea . ´ ( Bell ) ´ All right , darling , you win . I ´ ve Just realised something . ´ I don ´ t want to kill you - you ´ re the best . ´ If I kill you , what would be left ? Life would be a bore . ´ Why don ´ t you Join us ? We could have a wonderful life together . ´ You would be a constant challenge to me . ´ Join me in the bell tower . What do you say , darling ? ´ Don ´ t let pride stand in your way . ´ Whee ! Whee ! Whee ! Whee ! ( Engine splutters ) Bye , bye , lover . ( Death knell ) ( Hatch opens ) ( Hums ) # From glen to glen and o ´ er the mountain side # The summer ´ s gone and all the roses ... # .. ´ Tis you , ´ tis you must bide and I must go # But come ye back when summer ´ s in the meadow ... # Everybody ´ s doing it now , you see . You ´ re quite sure you killed him ? Father , who taught me ? You ´ re a girl after my own heart . If only your mother could see you . Good old Josephine . Tell me again about her last cavalry charge . Not now , child . We have work to do . Gentlemen ! Yes , all right . That ´ s very good . In one hour ´ s time , London will lie entirely in ruins . No more Trafalgar Square - it will be Napoleon ´ s Square . Nelson ´ s Column will be Napoleon ´ s Column . Then my little girl here will take over Bond Street . And you , merry lads , can have ... Chelsea Barracks . Ungrateful swine ... And then we will be taking over the entire regions . - The Scottish Marshal here ? - Present . - Are you keen on soccer ? - Aye , sir . - Like Wembley Stadium ? - Aye , I would . It ´ s yours . Welsh Marshal ... What a great day for the Nationalists . Thank you , Jones . Irish ? He ´ s gone to the armoury . Blast ! What does he do down there ? The countdown has now started . Hmm ? ( Bleeping ) Yes , of course . Thank you . As I was saying , the countdown has already started . In a few minutes , we transfer to the speedboat for the final phase . O ´ Rourke will ... Where is Marshal O ´ Rourke ? Find him at once . All of you ! Oh ... It ´ s Waterloo all over again . ( Man ) He must ´ ve come through here . - Is O ´ Rourke anywhere ? - ( Irish accent ) No . - He must ´ ve come through here . - I haven ´ t seen him . What ´ s going on here ? Excuse me a minute . Take your firing positions . Fire ! This one won ´ t backfire , darling . ( Bleeping ) This climbing rope holds an elephant . I ´ ll remember that the next time I go climbing with one . There won ´ t be a next time , darling . Your death will be original - on a rocket ride . Where is the rocket ? It is here . All around you . The lighthouse itself is the rocket . You ´ ve guessed . You ´ re not the Duke of Wellington , are you ? I expect you ´ re surprised to meet me . Aren ´ t I an extraordinary man ? Crazy . This is the nose cone . When the rocket reaches London , you ´ ll be the first to know . - Won ´ t that be exciting ? - I ´ ll go to pieces . ( Bleeping changes tone ) It is time to board the boat . The flight pattern is set . All that remains is to fire the lighthouse when we get to sea . Bon voyage , darling . Think of me when you hit town . ( High-pitched tone ) Careful , careful . They ´ re my records , you know . That ´ ll do . Please hurry , it ´ s three minutes to blast-off . I must have my papers , these are the history . ( Engine switches on ) I ´ ve always taught you to be calm and methodical . - Oh ... - What is it ? - I forgot to turn the gas off . - Oh , Father . Look ! Stop him ! Not those , these . Oh , yes . ( Ticking ) And that is how I saved London from the mad scientist . - Oh , one more , please . - No more tonight . It ´ s past bedtime . Come on . - There ´ s a good girl . - You will come tomorrow , please . We ´ ll see . - Promise . He will come ... - Tomorrow , he will come . - I want to hear more . - Shh ! Sleep . I ´ ll come tomorrow . I don ´ t think I have any other important appointments . He might drop his guard with children ... - He might give something away . - It was worth a try , Number Two . He told them a ... He told them a blessed fairy tale . He wouldn ´ t drop his guard with his own grandmother ! " Good night , children ... " everywhere . "

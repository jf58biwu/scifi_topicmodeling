 There 's twenty taels of gold here . , lt 's all yours , provided you kill the bastard for me . That depends , how good is his kung fu ? Better than yours . , lf you know his kung fu is better , why call on me ? Do you think I 'm a killer ? , You 're not a professional killer , but you claim to be smart . You 've got no choice , you have to kill him . , lf you don 't , you know what will happen . , What can I do ? You 're blackmailing me , I have no choice . , Another challenge . , To the Phantom Killer , I 'm coming after you . , I hear you 're a kung fu expert . I challenge you to fight . , lf you win , I want to be your student . , Regards , Chen Rong . , You 'll be sorry , you bastard . I 'll teach you a lesson . , To Chen Rong , Your challenge is accepted . , Meet me on the fifth on Green Mountain and we will fight . , Yours Sincerely , The Phantom . , Lady , can I have a meat pie , please ? I just remembered , I don 't eat meat . Can you change it , please ? - Hey , where 's my money ? - For what ? , - The pie ! - l didn 't want it . , - You bit it , so pay . - But I gave it back ! , You rascal , you can 't do that . , lf l get my hands on you , you 'll be sorry ! , My bird escaped , kid ! You 'd better be able to pay ! , No ! Let me go ! , How dare you hit me ! , Watch yourself ! is this yours , my friend ? , Hey , fatso , keep your nose out of this . - Had enough ? - Yes , I give up . , Listen , you , I 've got a question for you . What is it ? , - Where is Green Mountain ? - Green Mountain ? , - Why ? - l 've got some business there . , Business ? Ah , you 're going to fight the Phantom Killer . , - How did you know ? - Don 't worry , you 're the winner . , How do you know ? I haven 't fought him yet . , - l am The Phantom Killer . - What ? You 're the Phantom Killer ? , Of course . But you won 't beat my master . , Who is your master ? , There isn 't a fighter in this town who could beat him . , Yong Sheng Kung Fu Centre , So you want to challenge me , young man ? , Not really , but if you can defeat me , you can be my master . I 'll do exactly as you say . , I 've fought hundreds of men in my life . , And you know what ? I 've never been defeated . , I don 't want to hear about your past , let 's fight . , - Boy , my weapon ! - Yes , master . - Not this one , my favourite one . - Yes , sir . Come on ! , Get up . , I said get up , old man . Did you hear me ? , Get up quick . That 's it . , Are you all right ? , Think you 're smart ? I just wanted you to hold it . Come on ! , Stop making stupid excuses . , He can hold them instead . Come on . , You claim you 're a kung fu master ! You 've no idea how to fight . , Maybe you defeated me , but there 's no way you 'll beat my master . You 've got a master , too ? Of course , he 's a famous grandmaster . What 's more , he 's an expert in every style and weapon . He 'll beat you good . , Wow , he sounds very tough . Where is he ? He 's in the Fai Valley . , Master ! , You 're him ! , Abbot , master . That his name be praised and may he bless you . , I 've been in retirement for years . I want no trouble . , lt wasn 't my intention to fight . , But when I heard you defeated my students , I thought I 'd give you the benefit of my experience . , I 'd like to give you some advice . , Sir , must you and your students always talk so much ? , They have followed my teachings . , Let 's stop talking and start fighting . , I fear , my boy , that if we fight , you may get hurt or even die . What do you have in mind , then ? , We take three blows each , alternately , until one of us gives up . , - OK , I 'll hit you first . - No , I 'll go first . , Go ahead . , Sorry , if that was too painful , I 'll stop . , You don 't have to continue . , Give up . There 's no shame in losing . , - Forget about it. I can take it . - Right , it 's your turn then . , Master , it 's your turn . , Master , was that a joke ? Does that blow count ? , Right , it 's my turn again . , I can 't take any more . , Master ! Master ! , - Master , what happened ? - l give up . Take me to the temple . , The next time you fight , don 't expect me to get involved . , Yes , master . , Mister , know who the best fighter around here is ? , No . , - What , are you blind or something ? - Yes , blind as a bat . Are you all right , old man ? , I 'm all right , thank you . , - Are you all right ? - Yes . , Not bad. I wonder how good his fighting is. I think I 'll test him . , You ... , Wow ! That was good . He 's just the man I want . , Master ! , Are you talking to me ? , That 's right , I am . Accept me as your student . , Damn fool ! , I swore an oath on my ancestor 's grave , if anyone could beat me , he would be my master . , - You should help me keep my promise . - l promised nothing . , You defeated me , you shouldn 't break a promise to the dead . , Stop bothering me , or you 'll get a good hiding . , Hey ! You must teach me everything , I need to know more styles , master . - ls that right ? - l 'm afraid so . , Master ! , Master ! , I 'll follow you ! , Master ! , Chun Yao ! , Hey , master ! Who was that ? , Some nut begging me to be his master . , He knows you 're a kung fu expert ? , Yeah , I helped this blind guy in town and he was watching me . We have enough problems already . You know it isn 't wise to cause trouble . , I 'm well aware of that . Hey , you start cooking . - Mistress ... - Chun Yao ! , What are you doing here ? , I 'm a good cook . Take me as your student , master . Rubbish ! Take you as my student just because you 're a good cook ! , Then I 'd have to take in every cook in town ! , You shouldn 't compare me with them . , Get out ! Beat it ! , - He 's still there . - Forget him , he 'll be gone soon . Thanks . , Boy . , Hey , boy ! Boy ! , Good morning , Mistress . Why didn 't you eat the food ? , That food could have been leftovers for the dogs . , Master must say before I eat , mistress . Good morning , master ! I 'm going for a walk . , Bathing House , That 's good . , - Leave your clothes in the lockers . - OK . , Your towel . , And yours , sir . , It wasn 't me . , Hey , it was fatso ! He did it . Get out of here ! , What do you think you 're doing ? , I didn 't mean it . , - Watch it ! - Sorry . , You 'd better be . , - Hey , boy ! - Yes ? , What is it , sir ? , My fat friend would like his clothes cleaned . , Right away . Are these them ? , - Yes , hurry . - Yes , sir . Thank you . Please , come again , sir . Where the hell is he ? , - Where did my friend go ? - He just left . , - He left ? - That 's right . , Hey , attendant ! Where are my clothes ? Your clothes ? In the laundry . , ln the laundry ? Who sent them there ? , Your friend said you wanted them washed . , - Washed ? - That 's right . , You can 't run away from me , master . I know where you live . Chun Yao ! , Big brother 's men are coming to get you ! , ls big brother coming ? , He 'll be here soon and all his men are coming , too . Hurry , leave now ! Yoo Yi ! Yoo Yi ! Yoo Yi ! , What is it ? , Big brother 's men are here . Pack up , we 'd better leave . Master , I should help . I 'll guard the house . I won 't let anyone in . They 'll have to fight me first . , Oh , sorry ! , Hey , brother , who is that fat guy anyway ? - Some kind of nut ! - Chun Yao ! , - Let me . - Come on , let 's go . , Get lost ! , Fatso ! , - Tell Chun Yao to come out . - Who ? , You heard me . , Who 's he ? , No , no-one here ! Maybe he already left . , Goddamn you ! Move aside ! Bring Chun Yao out here ! , - Can you see Chun Yao ? - No , sir . , Are you sure ? , Now get out of here ! , Let 's go . , They can 't even fight. I wonder why master is afraid of them . , You 'd better rest . , Maybe his kung fu isn 't all that good. I think I 'll test him again . , There 's no doubt , he 's the best . , Master ... , He might hit me again . , Damn it ! , Master , you 're kung fu 's very good , so why are you afraid of them ? , Shut up and mind your own business . , Master , Confucius said , when in doubt ask , so don 't be so hard on me . Well , did you kill anyone ? , Of course not , I just hurt them a bit . , Master , why are you running from those guys ? , You seem to know them , it doesn 't make sense . , How dare you , you impudent fool ! , Master ... , How do you know they 're my relations ? , I was only guessing . , Chun Yao ! , Leave him ! , Chun , you 'd better stay at my uncle 's , they won 't look there . Let 's go . , Fine , you go ! But I 'll follow . , Have a seat . , Uncle . , Sit down . , Uncle , please don 't tell anyone Chun 's here . , Don 't worry , I won 't . , I 'm sorry to bring this on you . , That 's all right . I 'll get you some clean linen . , Make yourselves at home . , Here , Yoo Yi , have some tea . Chun Yao , we can 't run forever , they 're bound to find us . You have to be realistic . , This will never end unless you see big brother and I 'm tired of running . , lt 's easier said than done , please try to be patient . , Look , any problem can be solved if you try . , Unless ... , I can 't do it . , All right , I know . , - Thank you very much . - You 're welcome . , - l 'll see you to the door . - Goodbye . , Sorry about all this , Uncle . , That 's all right . What are relatives for ? You 'd do the same for me . , Mistress , I 'll do whatever master doesn 't want to do . , I 'm sure we can solve any problem . , You don 't understand . , Explain it to me . I can 't help unless I know the facts . , As a loyal student I should help . I 'll do everything in my power . , But you 're not his student . He never accepted you . , Who cares ! I made myself his student . , lt 's a very long story . I understand how Chun Yao feels . , Then tell me , so I can understand . Please , mistress . It 's so complicated ! Where do I begin ? , Just take your time and tell me from the beginning . , It was on the night of our wedding . , Happiness , Congratulations ! You lucky guy , she 's beautiful . , Let 's drink to the bride . , Hey , get off me ! , - Let 's see the guests out . - Right . , Here 's to the happy couple ! Long life and happiness ! , - Goodbye , thank you . - Goodbye . , Watch your step . , Thank you . Thank you ... , Hey ! Don 't go yet . The party 's just beginning . , lt 's a great day . What 's more , you 're father of the bride . , Get out of here ! , And lots of happiness , too . , Stop this , enough ! He 's just drunk . , Has anyone seen big brother ? , Why have you blown out the candles ? That 's bad luck . , Big brother ! It 's you ! , - Let me go ! - Stop yelling , woman . , Whatever belongs to Chun Yao belongs to me . , lf my father hadn 't taken him off the street , the bastard would have starved to death . , He 's just an orphan . I 'm the one you should have married . , What are all of you doing here ? Get out ! , Get out , the lot of you ! Go on , get out ! Go on , out you get . Go on . I 'll go , too . You better leave . , I told my sister to marry you . But the fool said she didn 't love you ... , Hold it ! , Where are you going ? , There 's no point in our staying here . , Just you listen . Who took you into this house ? Who cared for you ? , Who was it that blinded me ? , Think about that , you ungrateful swine . All right , you can go . But Yoo Yi stays with me . No way ! , Then I 'll make up your mind for you . Men ! Don 't let her leave the house . , Don 't just stand there ! Get her ! , Don 't hurt my sister ! , Are you OK ? , Hey , don 't throw her around like that ! , How dare you ! I 'll show you ! , You dare beat me ! , Why don 't you fight back ? , Kill him ! I want her alive . Go ! , On my back ! , Brother , take her and go . Run for it ! We 'll hold him back . , Get out of here , all of you , I 'll handle him . Out of the way ! , Get out of my way , you bastard ! , They were playing one day when Chun Yao blinded him . , He 's lucky he 's only blind in one eye . , I 'll poke his other one out for him . , What 's this about an eye ? , Are you crazy , telling this stranger about our affairs ? , Master , why not teach me so I can take revenge for you ? , - Revenge for what ? - On your wedding night , remember ? , That bastard with your wife ! You must really hate him . , I 've never hated anyone ! , Never in my life have I seen a bigger coward than you ! , You chicken shit ! Go on , admit it , you 're scared ! Wake up and smell the roses , you stupid bastard ! , You can 't hide forever ! You think you 're a hero . , So why aren 't you fighting back , you coward ! , You 're a coward and a fool ! , You stupid fool ! , You 're lucky this time . If I catch you , I 'll kill you ! , That won 't do you any good . It won 't help you get your revenge . , Stay away from us , or I will kill you ! , - What 's taking you so long ? - Don 't worry , I 'm working on it . , Who are you ? , I am a killer . , A killer ? , I work in secret . No-one ever knows who I 'm going to kill next . , - So who are you going to kill today ? - Liu Chun Yao . , Liu Chun Yao . , - And who are you ? - l am ... , I am the killer of killers , if you know what I mean ? Ah ! You 're going to kill me ! , You 're doing it all wrong . , Well , I 've never killed myself before . Don 't worry , master . This man wanted to kill you . But I took care of him . How dare you come in here ! , Well , I wouldn 't have dared except I know you 're a kind man and you 'll forgive me . , Mistress . , I 'll count to three , then you 'd better be gone . If I don 't have your forgiveness ... I 'd rather die . , - One ... - Chun Yao ! , - Two ! - Have some tea first , master . , - Three ! - Mistress ... , - No , darling ! - Out of my way ! , Master ! , I 'm not your master ! , Mistress , master ... , - Stop it , Chun Yao ! - Stay out of this ! , Chun Yao ! , Master , stop this . Stop now , I 'm warning you , or I 'll fight back . Fight back then . , I 'll get you for that ! , Watch it ! , Excuse me ! , If you want to fight , go outside . , All right . Master , you heard what the lady said . , - You ? - Me , you see ? I 'm good . , Let 's get out of here . Mistress . , Master ! Come on , I 'm over here . , Brother Chun , take it easy or you 'll kill him . , Stop a minute . There 's a rumour that master 's very sick , he may die soon . , Really ? , It might be a trap . , You 're right , but it doesn 't matter , I have to go . - May I come ? - lt 's none of your business ! , What do you mean ? , lf he 's your master , then he 's my grandmaster , and we 've never met ! This could be our last chance . , Master , forgive me , I 'm late . Come here , boy . , Where do you live ? Where are your parents ? , I don 't have any . , Go away and leave him alone . , Oh , poor boy . , Chun ... Yao ... , I spoilt Chong Ming . , But he was my only son . , Promise me ... that you 'll protect him and guide him . , Dad . , My son ... , Dad ! , Master . , Master . , Mistress , it 's an ambush . They 're waiting outside . You must leave now ! , - Get going ! - Come on ! , Chun Yao ! Chun Yao , let 's go ! , Well , Liu Chun Yao , you can 't escape this time . Chen Rong , please take care of my wife for me . , Yeah , of course . , All right , men , kill him ! - Who are you ? - Her brother . , lt makes no difference to me ! , I give up ! , I 'll show him . , No , don 't , please ! This is the blunt side . , That 's enough ! This time I really give up . , I didn 't mean it . , Don 't be scared , mistress . , - Master ! - l 'm not your master ! , - That wound 's pretty bad ! - Go away ! , I asked you to look after my wife . Go ! , - Chun Yao ! - Mistress ! , Stay back ! , Chun Yao ! , Chun Yao ! , - Who told you to fight ? - lt was my own decision . , Mr Ming , stop the fight and call them off . , I will stay with you . , Stop ! , Chun Yao , ever since I 've known you , we 've been on the run . Now here we are , back where we began . , You won 't face facts . You 're a coward . , This must be settled once and for all . , Following you ... running all my life , I can 't take any more ! , I want a home where l can settle down . , I 'm going to stay with Chong Ming . , It 's best we part . , Yoo Yi , you don 't love me ? , Get out of my life ! I never want to see you again . , Please don 't look at me that way . There is nothing between us any more . , I never thought you 'd abandon me . , I didn 't realise you were such a coward . , Right , I see now , I 'll go . Let him go . , Chun Yao ! , - Master . - Beat it ! , I can 't believe she means it . , Don 't be sad . As soon as the funeral is over , we 'll get married . , - You ! Show Yoo Yi to her room . - Yes , sir . , This way . , Master ! , Yoo Yi ! Yoo Yi ! , Yoo Yi ! Why did you do this ? , One last wish ... Please , leave Chun Yao alone . , Yoo Yi ... ! , Yoo Yi ! , Hey , you ! , What are you doing up there ? , Well , ah ... I 've been repairing the roof. it 's fixed now . , What do you want ? , All right ! That 's enough ! , Master , are you satisfied with my kung fu ? , Master Tong , if you weren 't good , I wouldn 't have sent for you . Hey , you , get some men together . Take Yoo Yi 's corpse and bury it in the forest . , This way . , ln the forest ? , Hey ! Hurry up ! , Hold on . , What 's the matter ? , This place gives me the creeps . It 's full of ghosts . , Don 't be stupid ! There 's no such thing ! Not in this world . , Maybe not , but what about the other world ? There 's nothing to worry about . We may as well protect ourselves though . , I 'll keep this for myself , and here you take this . Here , this will protect you . Now don 't be scared . Let 's go . , My God , it can 't be ! I don 't believe it ! What 's the matter ? , - l need a pee. I won 't be long . - There 's always something . Be quick ! , We need a pee , too . We 'll be back soon . Don 't worry , we 'll be right back . What 's going on ? They 've all disappeared , I 'm alone here . This place sure is creepy . Lucky I 've got this . , No , it can 't be ... No ! , I hope this damn thing works ! , It does work ! , What happened to your teeth ? , Damn things wouldn 't stay in . Cheap rubbish ! , - You 're not Dracula ! - You don 't think so ? Try this ! , Yoo Yi , why did you have to kill yourself ? Poor mistress is dead and master doesn 't want me here , maybe I should go . , Master , I 'm leaving . Master , I 'm leaving . I said , I 'm leaving ! - Chen Rong . - Yes . , Why did you call me ? , - Where will you go ? - l don 't know . , I 'll try and find a master somewhere . , - Really want me to teach you ? - You bet ! , Why else do you think I let you hit me around ? , So you 'd teach me . , Why do you want to learn kung fu ? Revenge ? , What revenge ? No way , I don 't hate anyone . , I want to learn because I 'm interested , it 's healthy , a good hobby , I like it ... I 'm interested , that 's all . , First I 'll teach you the iron Cross technique . , You need to combine both strength and speed . , And it involves both the feet and the fists . , Once you master this style , you can use it for both attack and defence . , Attack and defence , I see . Continue . , Hey ! Don 't just sit there ! Get up and practise . , Right ! , - lt 's taking you far too long . - When the moment comes , I 'll do it . , I want Chun Yao dead by tomorrow at the latest . , Tomorrow ? , Your kung fu has improved a lot . But you 're not powerful enough . , You must practise hard , like a circus horse . Learn stamina ! Why so hard ? , - Ready ? - Yeah . , Master , there 's someone in the bushes . They probably want to kill you . , I 'll handle it . , Leave it to me . , You ... ! , I 'm sorry , master . But I 'm also the victim . - Good work . - Well , the job 's done . - Release her . - l 'll keep my word . , Mother ! , - Mother ! - Chen Rong . , You carried out the contract . In return you get the gold and her . , Take them and get out of here . , That 's right , I killed Liu Chun Yao for you . , But I feel bad about it . , It 's a bit late for that . You murdered him , he 's dead . , Maybe , maybe not . Sometimes dead men just won 't lie still . , What do you mean by that ? , Take it easy . , This is a family affair . I want no part of it . , Whatever your problems are , they 're between you and your brother . , - You ... - Hold on . , You kidnapped my mother so I 'd kill Liu Chun Yao . , I 'd no qualms whatsoever in double-crossing a swine like you . , The day he said he 'd be my kung fu master , I told him everything , how you hired me to kill him . , Your move . , Chun Yao , don 't be a coward , kill him . Mother , let 's go ! Chen Rong . , Chen Rong ! Chen Rong ! , Mother ! Mother ! , Mother ... ! , Chong Ming , you son of a bitch ! , Chun Yao , don 't be a coward . Face up to him . Kill him . , Chen Rong ! , Never have I seen a bigger coward than you . You chicken ! , Own up , you 're too scared . You 'd better face reality . , Wake up , you stupid bastard ! Come on , fight ! Stop hiding ! Face them ! , You coward ! , Hold it ! , I 'll take care of him . , And who are you ? , Does it matter ? You 're no friend of mine . , What does it matter if you know my name ? , Listen , I 'm warning you , you 'd better stay out of this . Otherwise , you 'll all die ! , I warned you , don 't push me too far ! , is it really fair to kill the bastard ? , Here lies my friend , Chen Rong , Chen Rong ! ,

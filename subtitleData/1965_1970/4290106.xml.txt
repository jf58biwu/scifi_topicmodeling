 What seems like a fairy-tale today can become reality . This is a tale of the future . Neither States nor Nations are left . Mankind is colonizing the distant stars . Oceans have been claimed for living space . With speeds unimaginable today starships flash through the galaxy . One of them is the Orion , As tiny part of the Security System defending Earth against menaces from outer space . Let us join the Orion and her crew patrolling at the edge of infinity ... . The phantastic adventure of the space ship Orion . Planet out of orbit ! subtitles translation by Ralf Zimmermann Any chances ? None we just lost the drive ! At least we are not in the eye of the storm . Hopefully it won 't happen ! Transmission ! Ready , intensifier is on . Emergency call from starship Hydra ! A super-nova thrown out of orbit is falling towards earth . Approximate speed is 146000 Km per second . With the Size of a little star hitting earth immediately . General van Dyke calling ... emergency call from starship Hydra . May I get the space ship ! What 's the name ? Orion 7 I hope it 's not broken . Baloney . That 's nothing . Thank you . Commander MCLane ? YES Galactic security , you have to come with us ! Whereto ? Headquarters , your radiotelephone please ! I am not allowed to give it away ! Don 't cause any trouble . That 's an order ! to avoid communication with your crew . Why ? What is that ! Impulse waves from the galaxy ! Can 't determine where they are from . Impulse waves impossible ! On screen . Oh my god ! Interstellar live-forms . We hit their impulse waves . Capture video . On . The solar system . Earth Earth orbiting around the sun . Transfer video to earth . In what sectors have you been ? 411 22 412 delta , 413 416 epsilon 422 A 47 420 ? No . Why ? No assignment ! Any observations ? None ! You ! None ! What has happened ? Emergency call from the Hydra What happened with General van Dyke ? just a second ! Results ? YES We checked everything the Major is right ! What did you expect ? Nothing ! Please what happened ? So far we know it is a directed super-nova ! A nova is possible but directed ! These are the facts . Senior management is debating permanently ! A nova is possible but directed ! Who did it ? Let 's see the message from the General ! Emergency call dealing with a directed super-nova thrown out of orbit probably by the frogs to destroy us ! Can 't maneuver General van Dyke Emergency call from ... . A directed nova heading towards earth . Emergency call ... . the nova will hit earth . a planet like a sun will reach earth soon . Emergency call ... . I served under the General 6 six years . Can we save her ? That 's not our concern Major ! Mankind 's future is on stake . Colonel ! Plan DX-17 save the earth ! Why didn 't you report the nova on your last assignment ? He couldn 't ! Why ? It happened after McLane 's patrol . The speed is 146000 km per second ! Do the math . It happened afterwards ! The data shows it started 36 hours after I returned . Exactly The Orion 's records confirm everything . Good I 'll accept . I want to add ... Don 't argue . We have important things to worry about . What are we going to do now ? How do we fight against a planet ? Just sitting and arguing doesn 't help ! The government is desperately waiting for suggestions ! Just Shooting with energy doesn 't help ! The nova is directed by the frogs . So how do we attack the Frogs ? How many ships are ready ? 5609 10 are not read yet . together 5619 Till when ? Half tonight . The second half within 4 days . Why not faster ? 2000 are on its way . 900 are stationed . The ships from Jupiter have order to return . We need all the ships . We need to have ships deployed in the outskirts Regardless to the government 's decision . The government is waiting for our suggestions . I 'll recommend evacuating the population ! How shall I evacuate earth without ships ? We don 't attack the frogs ? Are we evacuating instead ! Evacuating doesn 't make any sense . We could only save 0.25 per mill maximum . Government has already decided not to evacuate . So ... Politicians rule even when there is nothing left . Then the military is capitulating . No we are not . This is not a regular war ! We asked the generals for help ! But you don 't offer any ! The highest councils withdrawing doesn 't make any sense ! Nor the moving of the highest command . Why ? I can 't guarantee to keep the Escape secret ! Are you expecting a panic ? Sure I do ! What do you recommend ? To keep everything disclosed and top secret . How much time do we have left ? About 7 days ! Till the impact ! Impact ... . But not the catastrophe . What 's the difference ! The nova is falling towards terra with increasing speed ! Terra will dry out and burn down before the impact ! We have only 5 days . Can we stop it ? Or alter the course . If we would know the location of the control station ? We destroy the control station and the nova will pass earth . That 's a possibility ! Let 's find the control station ! No I can 't send every ship after the frogs . It is like looking for the needle in the haystack . that 's dilettantism . This is not a regular war ! Theoretically we could try a stellar explosion . How ? With transmitting energy ! or antimatter . But that 's only a theory not a real change . Let 's stick with destroying the control station ! Please agree . I 'll recommend 200 ships for the search . We might have better changes than we think . All right . Give the orders . Thank you . Finally we are coming to a decision ! McLane . General ? Start immediately . A question . Do we have any contact with the Hydra ! No it broke up yesterday . We tried everything ! Did you write off the Hydra ? YES . Base 104 ready for emergency start of Orion 7 . Switch to Automatic when Countdown minus 10 . 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Four tanks are damaged . Oxygen supply should last for only 72 hours . Use the space suits instead . General ! An Earth station ? No strange noises . Please listen . No not from earth . Strange signals Are these signals from the Hydra ? Definitely not . Atan is entering the data into the computer . Frogs ? Possible ! Their intensifiers are incredible . Why not , they can throw planets out of orbit . What do we have to expect . Are they attacking us ? Don 't know . Ready . One second . I 'll get them first . Terrific idea ! what are you going to do ? We 'll figure it out . You have no idea ! Hurry I got their frequency . Capture it . A data stream to control the nova . Cliff the frogs are scanning us ! Do we have their coordinates ? Impossible without a second tracking station . Where shall I get one ? How shall we destroy them without knowing their location ? Probably they are on an asteroid in the Vesta group . In-coming transmission . The General ! Sub-radio on ! On Commander . Hydra Orion 7 is calling . Hydra with General van Dyke . McLane ? General ! Switch the channel they might track us . What is your mission ? to find the control station and destroy it ! The nova will change its course and pass away ! What do you think ? It seems too easy ! I 'll pick you up . No . For sure ! I prohibit you to come . General ! This is the only change for the earth . Do you understand ? Yes . You have to destroy the control station . Every second is important . They are reading us . I know I need their co-ordinates We got scanned too . Here are the co-ordinates . Capture it . On . Reading . RS 501 4M up seven 196 8 Gamma . 2 epsilon . Understood . Hello Orion ? Do you read ? What 's up ? We can 't hear you . I 'll order you to ... . I 'll pick you up ! Course towards Hydra Accelerate ! If you change the course I 'll melt down the cockpit . Are you stopping me from saving the Hydra ! I won 't hesitate ! Did you lose your mind ? No ! Don 't you know what happens ? It 's Suicide ! Don 't go there ! I don 't care If I die because of malfunctions or because earth got destroyed The results are always the same . Careful I am not afraid . Everybody knows that you are a queer fellow . But I didn 't know that you are brainless without any responsibilities . Are you talking armed with a gun ? Your assignment is to save earth . As long as you do it I don 't mind how you treat me . But do it . General van Dyke is ... General van Dyke is ... Don 't talk around the problem . You received the co-ordinates of the enemy Earth is in great danger and we are running out of time . We are a perfect target don 't risk to get destroyed by the frogs . Put the gun down . All right Commander . Battle station ready . Thrower 2 and 4 ready ? Converter ready ? Ready Commander . Are you satisfied ? Yes Commander . Battle station to Commander . Thrower 2 and 4 are ready . Understood . Scanned by enemy . Commander to battle station . Thrower Ready ! Thrower 2 and 4 are locked on target . Thrower ... Release ! The nova doesn 't respond . How do you know ? If the nova is off course ? The speed is unchanged . Any changes ? Nothing . How long are Quiet . How long are you steering to realize we have failed . Atan compute the course . What happens next Commander ? Let 's blast it away . An explosion ? Impossible . I won 't let it go ! Suggestions ? None ! Then be quiet ! There is no other change ! What are we doing now ? Here is the nova heading towards earth . Let 's call this line A , B and close to the planet C. At A speed up to Hyperspace . at B add reserve-energy . C reserve-energy and surplus . Passing the C-line we launch 15 antimatter-bombs and leave . 10 seconds before the impact we 'll detonate it . That should do it or I am at my wits ' end . What course do we take afterwards ? Towards the planet to get distance . Do we face a critical situation ? Sure but what are my options ? The course is unchanged . Are you sure ? The planet is still looping towards earth . When going from Hyperspace to reserve energy in seconds What happens with the computer ? The converters are melting . Are they yours ? No yours ! All right what will happen ? That 's a hell of energy . What happens to the computer ? Will melt down . so we lose navigation . Luminance and heat are increasing rapidly . Turn on the absorber . Why did I listen ? There is no change . What do you recommend ? We have to make a decision or we are lost ! We have to evacuate with all the ships . 200 cruisers chasing a nova don 't do any good . Government is debating the pro and cons The government didn 't give up on evacuating ? Not finally because of the pro and cons ! Accurateness needs time but we don 't have time . Any news ? Nothing ! Not even the position ! What does that mean ? McLane is too busy to entertain us . All communications are cut off within that chaos . Where is the nova now ? Here ! How much time ? 6 days till the impact and 4 till the catastrophe . The government has to decide now . We are running out of time . The entire fleet is coming back . None of the ships got close enough to the nova . How about the control station ? McLane will make it . Your faith in McLane is almost childish . Well Let me tell you something that is less childish . How could it happen ? that these beasts have built a control station to generate a nova ? Right in the middle of our territory ! That needs a lot of planning ! Are you asking me ? I am asking everybody ! Since MZ 4 We know that they exist and they are after us ! But that 's about it . We don 't know who and where they are ? They are appearing and disappearing to surprise us ! I recommended forming a research group already 2 years ago . But what happened ? It is a debating club that thinks we are the greatest ! If you ask me I always pursued a ... It doesn 't help us to blame each other . We don 't have time for this ! We have time all we can do is sit and wait ! Wait till the government decides or a miracle happens If there is a miracle than it is called McLane . Attention Orion Attention engineering ! Approaching B-line . B-line at minus 81 . Lock on target . Target locked . Countdown on ! ON ! B-line at plus minus 0 . Reserve energy on ! Ship on reserve energy ! Attention Engine ! Ready for battle station ! Ready for surplus . Bombs ready ! Approaching the C-Line . C minus 30 . Countdown on . On . 7 6 Attention . 4 3 2 1 0 . Au ! Bombs on target ... Ah ! Detonate Detonate Mario Damn ... Surplus off , Reserve off . Come on or the ship will burst ! It did not work ! Why ? The antimatter passed the nova before the detonation . Damn . Was it my fault Cliff ? No Mario . Help him ! YES What will happen with earth now ? I don 't know . It is exasperating to wait till the catastrophe happens without doing anything . We could do something . And what ? We have to force the government to come to a decision ! It is up to us to save mankind . So How ? Using force . You don 't know what you saying ! If the government fails then we have to take actions . As head of security I am telling you that anything further will be considered as high treason . You are going to die like all of us . I am not interested saving myself . I 'll stay when we evacuate but we have to make sure ... . Are you out of your mind ? The computers are calculating for several hours about the changes of evacuating . Who is entitled to survive ? Who selects them ? Who has more right to live ? What happens afterwards ? with the millions of people that have to stay ? There will be a huge panic worse than the catastrophe . Think about that ! Don 't generate more problems because you can 't control yourself . All right I was running amok therefore I apologize . Understandable . I hope I won 't be the next one . General tell me honestly Do you think the Orion still exists ? Does it matter to know what I think ? It has begun . People are requesting information A government member had a break down . They know that we have deployed 200 star-ships . Who the hell was talking ? Come on we are all human ! Don 't blame them for the burden . There is only one more change . Overload the Orion with pulsating energy and plunge the ship within the center of the nova and let everything explode ! That 's the only change . For earth I don 't want to die . How about you guys ? Commander We are not coming back ? I don 't know . We have to switch into the shuttles to break through to the Hydra . What are we going to do there ? Everybody is dead there us included . I can 't think of anything else . Let 's go for it . I 'll rather fly with the Hydra as planet through the galaxy than committing suicide with the Orion . At least there is a change to repair the drive of the Hydra . Are they still alive ? Let 's figure it out . Take all of the oxygen supplies . Atan enter the data to get precise co-ordinates for the shuttle launch . Ready to launch . Co-ordinates Hydra . Float A C deck . Floating . Hurry guys or we are too late . Cabin 11 , 12 , 13 , hydro system is floated . Load B-deck and air lock with energy . Energized . 3 minutes left . Shuttle 1 ready to launch countdown x minus 17 . Automatic on . Confirm Is there a change ? Controls ready ! Leave the cockpit . Ready for chamber 2 X minus 120 . Understood . Come on . Detonate . The government will tell us within 1 hour . Senior management is moving to the Mars stations . Without me I am not capable of doing that . Who voted to evacuate all the time ? It was never for my own sake . Gentlemen please no more blaming ! Any Messages ? Not the one we are waiting for . Incoming transmission from Jupiter station 4 . A tremendous explosion has happened . Where ? Crossing the course of the nova . How about the nova ? Disappeared . Are you telling that ... ? Gentleman do you understand ? We are saved ? Earth is saved ! Can I talk to Jupiter 4 ... ? Congratulations McLane made it ! It 's right . The nova is gone . I don 't know how Only McLane could do it , right ! It was McLane . What happened to him ? Nobody knows . but you think Not knowing the facts . We can 't make any assumptions . Don 't talk nonsense . McLane is dead . Whoever did that doesn 't come back ! We are almost there . If the ship still exists . That 's what we have to figure out . Calling General van Dyke , Hydra ? Hydra ? Hydra come in please ! Is the signal strong enough ? Baloney we can reach the next 10 sectors . Hydra come on in . Come on in . Cliff ? They are all dead ! How do you know ? If you look at the facts it becomes clear . They have been in the center of a storm now there is no sign of life . Do I have to explain it ? No Tell me please I don 't get it . The cosmic ray was extremely strong their shielding couldn 't resist . The temperature on board was too high to resist longer than ... . No epic descriptions . If you think that they are dead than just shut up . But she is asking . She will keep asking even if we enter heaven . Do you expect to come in heaven ? What did I tell you ? She is asking . Are the others following us ? I have an eye on them . Calling Hydra ! Hydra Hydra come on in ! Keep everything top secret ! I hope that the public won 't hear about the incident and we were incapable of coping with it . At least we made it ! We ? I know how you feel . I am terrible sorry . It had to happen . Never mind . Too bad McLane was a good man . Above all he was very popular , an hero and idol of the youth . Without being rude we have to come up with an explanation for his disappearing . Sometimes I hate my job . All right Villa , nobody is perfect as we have seen recently . Yes it 's easier for the heroes . Shuttle 1 calling shuttle 2 . Mario can you read us ? We should see the Hydra now . There she is . Like a dead flounder . Careful . I am going close so that Hasso can jump over . Stay on hold . Why jumping ? Can you just use autopilot ? Sometimes your questions are dumber than the ones from Lieutenant Jagelovsk . Who is activating the controls if we can 't get a radio response ? Sure you 're right . Sorry . Over . Thank you . Ready my friend . Mhm . I can 't spare you . I knew why ! Listen Even if it is hot like in hells kitchen . You have to push till the autopilot is up and running . What if it doesn 't work anymore ? Bad luck . Come back in the shuttle to survive a little longer . Commander What are we doing if we can 't get aboard the Hydra ? It depends on your taste ! Twirling your thumbs playing ludo or drink Mario 's last Whiskey . You can crochet if you have brought your little basket . Sooner or later there will be no oxygen or energy left . Can we just fly to the next space station ? Impossible like trying to explain you our situation . I am sorry to disturb now . Shuttle 2 Mario come in please . Yes Cliff ? Hasso is sweating . Get ready we have only seconds . the temperature must be like in an oven . After the landing we follow immediately right and then set up the shields to create a viable environment . Right . It is important to be as fast as possible Otherwise Hasso will start pouring sweat . Right . What is going on with you ? out of a sudden you are able to think ? Ready ? Please don 't forget liability is not included in our contract . He should be in the battle station now . No communications ? He has no time to talk ! He didn 't make it . It should have happened already . He can 't run around like a squirrel . It is hot like in an oven . Come on in sloths or do I have to send an invitation ! He made it ! Turn on Absorber ! Mario ? Yes ? Are you in chamber 2 ? What did you expect ? Pressure control . Done . Cold pressure . No that doesn 't make any sense ... . You are right ! Hasso Hasso open the locks ! Hasso Hasso where are you ? missing Shall I ... ? no , my turn . Press this button in one minute . Mario ? Yes ? Cold pressure and absorber . I 'll try to get into the battle station . Without suit and helmet ? Crazy . So tell me where is my Space suit ? Hasso has mine . His was left on the ship . Hasso ! What 's up ! Hasso The locks . Ready cold pressure okay Cliff ? What 's up . What happened ? Hasso are you alive ? No I am Hamlet 's ghost . Yes it seems like because you were never educated . Stay . Cliff . We seem to be okay now . The air is fine suddenly . Are you guys okay ? Sure otherwise you wouldn 't ask . What happened with Lydia and the crew ? Hibernating ! And ? We got them out . Almost too late . Running out of energy . We came at the very last moment . Good it seems to be our specialty . I wasn 't sure if you would follow the order . Lieutenant Jagelovsk was very supportive regards this issue . Otherwise we would have come earlier . Don 't be sarcastic . That was the worst experience we ever had . My serious approach saved the earth . Thank you . That was the 7th space ship that you crashed . It 's time for the 8th Orion . At least no one will blame you this time . Incoming transmission . I am not there . I am sure the armament department is requesting detailed reports . Everything okay ? We used the microcomputers from the shuttles . Some navigation is possible now . So we are flying back full steam . Optimist . Just minimum speed Let 's give it a shoot . Everybody on station . Atan Yes . Navigation ready ? I hope it will work . Let 's try it . Course earth . I have to go to the Uncle . Cheers Commander ! Some Whisky ? NO . This one is very rare . Produced in the traditional way out of real malt . Nothing artificial . Kept in barrels for centuries due to an old Irish recipe . How about a sip ? Just a little bid . It happens only once a live time to get such a gift . It was my wish . Really Major ? What for ? I crashed the fastest cruiser in the entire fleet . So ? Continuing ? Sure what 's next ? I filled in most of the questions but I didn 't know the reason for the accident . Oh ve , how to explain . Please help me General ? Just write ... hm . Was it another escapade ? Yes that 's exactly what happened . Just write that a magnetic storm destroyed the ship . He went to close as usual . A detailed report has to be filled afterwards anyway . For now this one should be okay . Sign please . There should be a better way than doing this , all this red tape . We have our problems too . We know that you guys have bigger problems than anybody else . We only had to destroy a Super nova . A Super nova . Excuse me what 's that ? Laughing ! subtitles translation Ralf Zimmermann

Are you all right ? [ panting ] Yes , of course . Oh , you scared me . I 'm sorry , darling . I don 't often wake up screaming , do I ? I 'm jumpy , too , this morning . Why ? It was my explosion , not yours . You weren 't dreaming about an explosion ? Why ? Shouldn 't I ? So did I. I thought I 'd woken up and then there was a great big bang and something hit me on the head . Oh , I did better than that . The whole roof seemed to fall in on top of me . I couldn 't move . I couldn 't breathe . Oh , Guy . Yes , it was quite a dream . It is awful when you dream you 've woken up . You never know quite what to believe after that . Still , the walls are still intact ... [ solid tapping ] ... built to last . Whoever heard of an explosion that didn 't break the windows ? We 're all in one piece , safe and sound , darling . It was only a dream . But we both dreamed it . Hey , come on , it 's eight o 'clock . Breakfast in two minutes ? Yes . It 's nearly ready . It might have been some sort of telepathy . [ tune plays ] Oh , no . They can 't do that . [ pop music plays through loudspeakers ] This is going to be one of those days . I can tell . First the ... And now this . Breakfast in two minutes ? [ pop music continues ] [ hums along to pop music playing outside ] Ready ? [ Guy ] Almost . I think , you know , everybody has bad dreams at some time or another . ln all these years of the bomb jitters , who wouldn 't dream of explosions ? And considered that way , it 's not even much of a coincidence . Now don 't consider too long , your breakfast is nearly ready . [ sizzling ] You know , darling , on the other hand- - Oh , the post is early . Yes . Three for me . One for you . I was thinking , there may have been an explosion on the other side of the town somewhere and we both heard it and that started us dreaming . What do you suppose could have blown up ? Well , only a slight explosion , of course . At the chemical plant , perhaps . But you 've always insisted that nothing can go wrong at the works . Well , just a thought . That 's all . " Pop star wins the Pools . " There can 't be much wrong with the world when that makes the front page . You know , there isn 't even anything else on the front page , except advertisements . I 've never seen so many before . I don 't know what we take the paper for . Now don 't let the breakfast get cold . I don 't feel very hungry . Oh , you 're not still worrying about that silly dream , are you ? If there is- - If there has been an accident at the works , it will be on the eight o 'clock news . There might even be a special flash . [ advertising jingle plays ] # Crunch , crunch , crunch # # Crunchie Pops Crunchie Pops # Turn that off . Switch it off , switch it off !

She wants to know when we 're going over . A bread and butter letter from the Farleys . And Maison Pilkington inviting me to a preview of their new collection . What 's yours ? Oh , a sample I expect . Feels bulky . What is it ? There 's no mention . It says , " Press to Start . " Are you going to ? What ? Press . It might be some sort of practical joke . [ high-pitched recorded voice ] You want a Feckle Freezer , you need a Feckle Freezer , you must have a Feckle Freezer .

Hello . Good morning , Mr. Birkett . Oh , good morning , Miss Mitkin . Get hold of the operator and find out what 's wrong with that line , will you ? I 've been trying to get Harry Barton for the last ten minutes . But Mr. Barton isn 't here . If you remember , he went down to the factory . A fault in the storage section , wasn 't it ? That was yesterday . Well , he hasn 't been seen since . That 's odd . Keep trying . I 'm sure Mr. Barton knows what he 's doing . Yes , I 'm sure he does , too . You know what today is , don 't you ? The 15th , the day the tax returns have to be sent in . I was just about to remind you of the tax returns , Mr. Birkett . That 's Harry Barton 's job . We could drive over to the factory with them . We 'd be there and back in an hour . No , I 'll do them for him , I suppose . There 's nothing to be afraid of at the factory , Mr. Birkett . The place gives me the creeps . Well , if you 'd rather spend half a day with these than half an hour at the factory . Yes , I would . It wouldn 't be so bad if there were a few people about . And all those machines ! They 're all programmed from the brain patterns of human beings . Yes . That 's just it . Machines . The Spelman process . They 're perfectly reliable , there 's no danger in the Spelman process . Jim Benskin is killed in a car accident , and the storage section carries on with his brain . Not his brain , Mr. Birkett , only his brain pattern . You 're quibbling . I don 't like the Spelman process . Think of it , a man controlling a machine after he 's dead . [ bell ringing ] I 'm afraid you let your imagination run away with you . Coffee , Mr. Birkett ? Yes , please . Two coffees , please . And 20 cigarettes . Your usual ? Marlins . Thank you . I didn 't know you smoked Marlins , Mr. Birkett . I don 't . Well , you just ordered them . I did ? Marlins ? They are supposed to be really good for you .

By the way , I notice a lot of your colleagues have taken to Frosty Flips . Very refreshing , I hear . Yes , well I 'd rather stick to coffee . Then these Frosty Flips will have to boost up their promotion campaign , won 't they ? Carry on , carry on . Well , 5432- - Oh , I see you smoke Marlins , Mr. Birkett . Yes , they contain a special anti-cough ingredient . Interesting , interesting . 81 .9 , 3532.9 . [ phone ringing ] This is going to take ages . Birkett here .

Look up the diary , will you , Miss Mitkin ? Please , Mr. Birkett . It 's dreadfully important . I may be able to fix you in tomorrow . Tomorrow 's no good . The day after ? There 's no such day as tomorrow . It has to be today . Not today , Mr. Birkett . But there 's nothing down for tomorrow . Today . Please . - 9.30 ? - 9.30 ? 9.30 tomorrow .

You weren 't dreaming about an explosion ? Yes . I suppose it 's a common sort of nightmare . But that was my dream , too . A great big bang and something hit me . It 's odd . Creepy . - Guy ? - Yes ? Don 't you get the feeling that- - What , darling ? Well , I suppose it must have been a dream . Is breakfast nearly ready ? Yes , yes , two minutes . Everybody has bad dreams at some time or another , darling . I mean , with all these years of the bomb jitters , who wouldn 't dream about explosions ? Well , you consider your breakfast .

[ voice continues ] [ smashing , voice becomes fragmented ] It came in the post . Yes , I can imagine . Was there anything for me ? No , just a note from Aunt Polly . She wants to know when we 're going over . A bread and butter letter from the Farleys . And Maison Pilkington invited me to a preview of their new collection . Now don 't let this coffee get cold . There 's something wrong , but I can 't put my finger on it , but- - That silly dream , I suppose . Or there might have been an explosion on the other side of the town somewhere , and we both heard it and that started us dreaming . What do you suppose could have blown up ? Nothing too disastrous , of course . " Pop Star Wins the Pools . " [ fire alarm rings ] Fire . [ alarm continues ] That 's illegal .

[ footsteps on stairs ] There is no appointment down for the day , Mr.- - - Swanson . - I sure would have remembered . Anyway , it would be here in the book . Nine-thirty , he said . And it isn 't . June 15th . No sign of it here . I might have known it wouldn 't work . You see , it has to be today . I 'm afraid Mr. Birkett has a very full schedule today . Yes , I know . He always has a very full schedule today . On the other hand , if it 's so important , I may be able to fit you in tomorrow . I tell you , tomorrow is no good . I 've tried that . Day after day , I 've tried . You see , and today was tomorrow yesterday and now it 's today again . You ought to calm down , Mr. Swanson . Can I take a message to Mr. Birkett ? Couldn 't I just wait here till he comes ? I 've told you , Mr. Birkett is a very busy man . You have to make an appointment . Well , if he could just see me , it might remind him . Remind him of what ? Good morning , Miss Mitkin . Oh , good morning , Mr. Birkett . This is Mr. Swanson . He is under the impression he has an appointment . - Oh ? - I have . I have . Look , I 'm Swanson . Think , Birkett . Try to remember . Please try . I 'm very busy , Mr. Swanson . What can I do for you ? Remember . Remember what ? You won 't believe me unless you remember . I 've tried all that . What am I supposed to remember ? That night , you know ... The dark room . It doesn 't matter . Sorry . I 'm sorry about that , Mr. Birkett . He just walked in . - What are those ? - The tax returns . They have to be sent in today . June 15th . Well , that 's Harry Barton 's job . Mr. Barton won 't be here . He 's over at the factory . We could drive over with them . No , all right . I 'll do them for him , I suppose . Eyes down , Miss Mitkin . [ buzzing ] Is Mr. Birkett available ? I 'd like to speak to him on behalf of Feckle Freezers . Feckle Freezers ? Well , if you were responsible for that hullabaloo this morning- - Oh , but that 's just the point . We want to apologise . Oh , well . If you could tell us where to get in touch with him . Well , he 'll be at the office now . But he is very busy . We want to recompense everyone who may have been inconvenienced by that outburst . Everyone . If you could tell us when Mr. Birkett usually has lunch ? Yes . [ advertising jingle plays ] # Tang , tang tang , tang # Taste the tang of Chocobites . Tingle tang of Chocobites . The usual table ? Yeah . I see you 've been redecorating . Yes , sir . What , since yesterday ? Quite recently . Yes , but I can 't say that I like it . Allow me . It 's stuffy in here . Have you got the heating on ? Yes , sir . What , in the middle of June ? If I might suggest a nice Frosty Flip . - No , thank you . - Very cooling , sir . No , thank you . No Frosty Flips . I don 't like their commercials . I see , sir . Mr. Birkett ? Yes . April Dorn , I 'm from the Feckle Corporation . Oh , indeed . Yes , well , after your company 's demonstration this morning- - May I share your table , Mr. Birkett ? There 's so much I want to talk to you about . Well , I don 't want to sound rude , Miss Dorn- - I would like you to call me April . Yes , well , I was about to say , I don 't think that I could talk about your company for very long without losing my temper . That 's why the Feckle Corporation would like to charge this lunch to their account . Oh , no , no , no . I couldn 't . You would rather not have lunch with me ? No , no , no . It 's not that . I want to apologise on behalf of the company , Mr. Birkett . Please ? - Oh . - Thank you . - Waiter ? - [ waiter ] Madame . I hear the turtle soup is very good . Is it ? I can recommend the turtle soup , sir . Well , turtle soup , then . And then , sir ? - Fillet mignon ? - Fillet- - Petits pois and asparagus . And a bottle of Nuits Saint Georges . Very good , sir . Well , that 's not really necessary . But you must accept . This is the least the Feckle Corporation can do for you . Why , you 're letting them off lightly . You could sue them for their last penny , disturbing your sleep like that . Yes . It was rather shattering . You 're just being nice about it . Some people actually complained to the police . Oh , it wasn 't as bad as all that . I knew you 'd understand . It 's just that well , the Feckle is such a wonderful freezer . Some of our outside men got carried away , they wanted everyone to hear about it . Yes , we heard . As soon as head office found out what had happened , they sent representatives around to every home in the neighbourhood to apologise . But really and truly , Mr. Birkett , the Feckle is a fine , fine freezer . Yes , yes , I 'm sure it is . Perhaps I shouldn 't tell you this but well , I 'd do almost anything for Feckle Freezers . White for madam , and black for you , sir . Now I have your signature and you have mine . Yes , yes . But you have more than that , though . You have a 12 cubic foot Feckle Freezer , self-defrosting , upright model . Price £ 275 . I 've never paid so much for a refrigerator in my life before . I don 't know what my wife 's going to say . Oh , I 'm sure your wife is very understanding and very sweet . He was very sweet , darling . He said he was a special representative sent to apologise . Well , I couldn 't leave him standing on the doorstop , could I ? So I asked him in , and he started to tell me all about this- - This thing . Guy , I signed a form this afternoon . Guy , darling , wouldn 't you like- - Not a Feckle Freezer . Twelve cubic foot . Self-defrosting . Horizontal model . Upright model . Price £ 275 . - But you didn 't- - - Oh , yes , yes . We shall be the only couple in the neighbourhood with a Feckle Freezer apiece . His and hers . What are we going to do with them ? There 's not room in the kitchen . I 'm sorry , darling . - Darling , if only you told me- - - I wanted it to be a surprise . Surprise ? It 's taking you to nearly midnight , to scrub enough courage to tell me . And how long has it taken you ? That 's twice 27 5 , that 's £ 550 for two freezers we don 't even want one of . I knew today was going to be hell . Feckle lousy Freezers . [ bell rings ] At least we can be sure of one thing , nothing else can happen today . Oh , blast . The spring is gone . The switch ? Well , don 't worry . You go up to bed . I 'll fix it . Oh , must you do it tonight ? Oh , darling . We can 't turn the light off . Either I fix it now or we leave it burning all night . I should remember to put that out of the way one of these days . Well , it 's just a matter of a couple of screws . No need for you to wait up . If you insist . Yes , with the right tools , this is a simple job . [ clattering ] Are you all right , Guy ? Yes , yes . It 's just a fuse , darling . Won 't take a couple of minutes . [ Guy clanging in cupboard ] [ Guy sighs ] [ light clattering ] Mary ? Mary ? [ solid tapping ] [ taps wood ] [ thud ] [ clattering ] [ faint commotion , indistinct speech ] [ faint whirring ] [ loud whirring ] [ click then silence ] [ ticking ] [ alarm ringing ] Guy ? Guy ? Where did you go ? That was awful . What ? This dream . It was like being caught up in an explosion . It woke me up and I couldn 't see you . You 're dressed . Yes , I didn 't get undressed . I banged my head , I must have been in the cupboard all night . I 'm not in a mood for jokes this morning , Guy . No , I 'm not joking . There 's something very odd out there . I mean , our walls , they 're not brick anymore and the floor , it 's- - It 's metal with this sort of plastic covering . Why ? I suppose the builders knew what they were doing . Oh , that was a very nasty dream . I would never have noticed if it hadn 't been for the fuse . Fuse ? Oh , the fuse , you know , the one that went last night , when I stayed up to repair . But you went to bed ahead of me last night , I switched off the lights . Darling , you couldn 't , there 's no switch . No switch ? No , I mean , it broke remember ? I screwed it , I haven 't had a chance to screw it back on yet . So , where are you going ? [ footsteps on stairs ] What 's wrong with that ? Watch , it shouldn 't . This is June 15th , Guy . Not April 1st . It 's not even June 15th . It 's June 16th . This is going to be another one of those days . Oh , you see , it 's already started with the wrong paper . - Look , yesterday 's . - Yesterday 's ? Yes , I remember that headline . - I don 't . - What ? But it 's the 16th ... Yes , of course it is . It 's the 16th . 15th . I had an appointment at the hair dresser yesterday , which was the 14th . Work it out . Anyway , does it matter ? No , no , I suppose not . They 're all for you . Oh , darling , about the freezers . - What ? - Well , the Feckle Freezers . I thought , you know , we could ring them up , explain that we 'd made a mistake and ask them if they would take one . What 's the matter ? What are Feckle Freezers ? Now there is something wrong . And the date is part of it . Yes , I can remember the 15th . I remember the tax returns . I wouldn 't imagine half a day 's work now , would I ? Guy , perhaps it was- - And I remember this headline , and your letters . Go on , open them . You 've already opened them . There was one from the one from the Farley 's bread and butter . And there was one from Aunt Polly . Asking when are we going over . And one from Maison Pilkington . Inviting you to a preview again , you know . You 're trying to frighten me . No , I 'm not . I 'm just trying to get this straight . [ bell rings ] It 's eight o 'clock . Yes , I know what the time is , darling . It 's the date that worries me . [ jingle for Crunchipops plays ] Turn that off . - Turn that off . - No , leave it . Perhaps they know what the date is . [ radio presenter ] Good morning . Here is the eight o 'clock news for today Wednesday , June 15th brought to you by Frosty Flip , the ice cold drink with the secret ingredient . Oh , darling , you must have had a very nasty bang on your head . No , I tell you it was nothing to do with the bang on my head . [ phone rings ] Hello . [ over telephone ] Could I speak to Mr. Birkett please ? My name is Swanson . Yes , hold on , would you ? It 's for you , a Mr. Swanson . Swanson ? Swanson . - Birkett here . - Do you remember yet ? Now look , Swanson , what 's going on ? You went through this routine yesterday . You remember ? What 's it all about ? I can 't tell you on the phone , where can we meet ? At the office . No , no , not there , not two days running . They might suspect . Look , what about- - What about that place you were at yesterday , The Crystal Restaurant ? Yes , look , Swanson , has it ... Has it something to do with the date ? Careful , Birkett , this is a public phone . I can 't ... I 'll see you there . As soon as they open . He knows , too . He knows . Guy ! Chocobites are tangy . Chocobites are tangier than tangy . Taste one , and you 'll want some more . Won 't you try my Chocobites ? No , thank you . Won 't you try my Chocobites ? No , thank you . Miss Dorn . I wanted to have a word with you about those freezers . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Well , about the freezer that you sold me yesterday . But I didn 't sell you anything . Well , of course you did . - Hey , you . - Me , sir ? You served us yesterday , didn 't you ? Did I , sir ? Well , turtle soup , fillet mignon , and all the- - If you 'll excuse me just one moment , sir . Of course , it was you . But you don 't remember , not yesterday . I couldn 't forget you , Miss Dorn . I 'm not Miss Dorn . Well , wait . You whoever you are . - They know . - Control yourself ! - Birkett , let them go . - Where have they gone ? Look , they know we are on to them . On to them ? Swanson , you better start from the beginning . Of course you don 't remember any of this , do you ? Look , about two months ago , you came banging at my door late one night . I did ? You were scared silly , babbling about men without faces and a huge hand in the sky . - You begged me to hide you . - Are you sure it was me ? I thought that you were out of your mind . And obviously you needed some help . I have got this darkroom , you know . It locks on the inside . Anyway , to keep you quiet , we both hid in there . And then in the morning , you said you 've got something funny to show me . You went out and you bought a newspaper . The date on it , Birkett , it was June 15th . And that 's today . I mean- - That 's it , you got it , you see ? It 's always today , every day the same . Every morning , the same news in the newspapers . Only the advertisements change , but who wants to read advertisements ? Always June 15th . Yeah . One night you stayed away too long before coming back into the darkroom . They got you again . When I found you a couple of days later you 'd forgotten everything . Somebody wants us to live the same day over and over again . Why ? Who are they , Swanson , and what 's in it for them ? I think they watch us . Watch us ? Yeah , I try to keep out of their way . I only come out to look for you . Watch us . Well , if they 're watching us , Swanson , we have nothing to lose . Come on . Birkett , look , it 's dangerous . Look here , Birkett . What is it ? Where are we ? There 's a ladder and it appears to be some sort of a tunnel . Quite a substantial bit of engineering . Tunnel ? There can 't be a tunnel . There isn 't a tunnel under ... That 's just what I was thinking . Come on . [ clanging ] Metal alloy , like the floor of my house . Look , Birkett , let 's go back . I think we ought to call the police . Proportions ... They 're all wrong . Supposing one of them sees us ? What does this remind you of ? Look , they got your mind last time , Birkett . Aren 't you scared ? Yes , yes , I 'm scared but what else can we do ? Come on . Wait for me . Look , supposing we meet one of them . Well , how do we know ? Oh , well , they 're easy to spot , once you know where to look . You see , we 're always the same but they change . That girl for instance , sometimes she wears fancy dress like today , other times she is in ordinary clothes . They play different parts . There appears to be some sort of gate . It 's locked . I wish I could place what it remind me of . Come on , Swanson . Let 's try one of these . [ faint sonic whirring ] What is it ? What 's the matter ? This is the plant . Contro Chemicals . Where is everybody ? There 's nobody about . There never was . It 's all controlled by computers . The Spelman process . He discovered how to transfer a man 's thought patterns from brain cells to electronic matrices . What does that do ? It gives a machine the mind of a human being . But why have all the machines stopped ? They were working yesterday . Harry Barton came over , too . Look , this is working . What is it ? It doesn 't belong here . Mary . That 's my wife . I told you they watch us . [ Guy ] They must have cameras planted everywhere . Why do they do it ? I don 't know but we 'll soon find out . - It 's locked . - There you are , you see . There must be something in there worth keeping under lock and key . Birkett , I don 't think we ought to be doing this . Just look at these . Hey , look , Chocobites . That girl was giving away Chocobites . Marlin cigarettes campaign . Marlin cigarettes . Frosty Flip , I bought one of those . Feckle Freezer , I bought two . What 's all this got to do with Contro Chemicals ? The layouts out for Crunchipops . Who put the crunch in Crunchipops ? Swanson , you 're right . This has nothing to do with Contro Chemicals . Now look , it 's advertising . Chocobites , Frosty Flip . Well , they 're at least ordinary anyway . Listen to this , Swanson . " Although test report K4 doubled the numbers sold , its use will be limited by local by-laws restricting the use of loudspeaker vans . " Now when did you last hear a loudspeaker van , Swanson ? They 're around us all the time . And what are they doing ? Advertising . Exactly , it 's poured into us every day . Newspapers , television , radio and even if we miss them , there are loud loudspeaker vans to get us out of bed . That 's what 's happening every day , isn 't it ? - Yeah , that 's what 's happening . - And it happens every night . Every night , our minds are wiped clean of all that 's happened during the day , so that we are all ready for the next day 's trials . We 're a captive audience . And they 're recording our responses . We 're nothing but guinea pigs . You mean they have taken over the whole town ? Yes , I don 't know how . Mass hypnotism , drugs perhaps , and if anyone knew how to work that particular trick , it would be our Mr. Spelman . [ conversation from outside the room ] You don 't have to worry about Birkett . He 's probably just wandering about . We 'll pick him up in the morning . That 's what you think . Oh , I take it all back . You were right . Why aren 't you at the office , Birkett ? - What do you want ? - I want an explanation , how you managed to kidnap 20,000 people . Of course , you realise how absurd you sound . Look , I know what you 've done , Spelman . I mean , all this is valuable information . I don 't know how much money is involved , I know for a fact that some companies spend two or three million a year on advertising . Suppose they learn to cut their costs and increase efficiency at the same time . Am I getting warm , Spelman ? You 're over-heated . I don 't think that 's very funny . You 're coming with me to the police . No , Birkett . I said that you are coming with me . I said no . No . Birkett . Birkett , the girl . You hit the nerve centre . Makes it very difficult to control this body . I 'm sorry . It should have been Spelman . Don 't worry too much , I can 't feel anything . My real body lies asleep until I switch back to it . But when I hit you- - Well , you 've worked for Contra . You know all about the Spelman process , linking brain patterns to machines . You mean that ... that you 're ... One of the Spelman machines , just like you . I 'm afraid you 're one of the other type , though . What are you talking about ? I 'm sorry for you , Mr. Birkett , really sorry . You see , I chose this way of living . I 'm well paid and I can give it up any time I choose . But you can 't . I tell you , Spelman 's going to be stopped . I 'll find my way out of this place . You can 't . Why not ? Because you 're dead . Dead ? The explosion . That was a dream . It was this chemical plant . One of the storage tanks blew up , almost everyone in the town died . You died with them , both of you . I 'm not dead . Look , I 'm alive . Your last day alive was June 14th . It ended with that bang . I tell you , that explosion was a dream . A dream . I woke up . June 15th is the dream . It 's made afresh for you every day by Mr. Spelman . No , he couldn 't . He couldn 't rebuild the whole town . But it- - It wasn 't necessary to have all the details exact . It only lasts for one day . At midnight , the maintenance crew swarms down the tunnel to every part of the town . The tunnel ? They put everything back the way it was on June 14th . If one of you finds something wrong when he wakes , he forgets it again after midnight . Swanson didn 't . I didn 't . - But you will . - It 's not possible . It would have cost millions . It made millions . It goes on making the millions . But that isn 't the end . Mr. Spelman has political ambitions . No , it 's not true , it 's not true , it can 't be true ! I 'll prove it to you . I 'm switching back to my real body now . I 'm going to disconnect . Now . Look . [ Spelman as robot ] Forget it , Birkett . Drop that bar before you do any more damage . This is Spelman speaking . You 're not Spelman . The mind is . I just happen to be using this as a body . And I doubt whether you could damage it . So let 's stop all this nonsense , shall we ? I don 't want to damage you either . You were far too expensive to create . I 'm Guy Birkett , I 'm not one of your damned machines ! I 'll smash your synthetic empire . You 'll have to kill me if you want to stop me . Go ahead . Nobody 's stopping you . [ siren blares ] [ bell ringing ] [ Spelman 's voice ] Birkett , this is Spelman . Spelman in the flesh . Now , why don 't you be reasonable and let the maintenance crew adjust you ? I 'm not beaten yet . I 'll find the way out . There 's nowhere for you to go . You can see that for yourself . You see , Birkett , for my advertising laboratory , I wanted the town rebuilt , working replacements for its dead population . Now that cost an awful lot of money . Fortunately , I was able to compromise . Why build an entire town when a scale model would do just as well ? Listen to me . Your world is built on a table top . No ! [ muted speech ] You won 't use me again . I 'll throw myself over the edge . No , little Birkett . No . [ siren blares ] [ thunderous explosion ] [ alarm clock rings ] Guy ! Guy , are you all right ? Yes , yes , of course . Oh , you scared me . What a fantastic dream . [ advertising jingle plays ] [ man over loudspeaker ] Are you a coward ? No . Are you a fool ? No . Are you going to let the incompetent run this country for five years ? No . What can you do ? Vote for Spelman ! Vote for Spelman ! Vote for Spelman ! Spelman ! Spelman ! Spelman ! Spelman ! Spelman !

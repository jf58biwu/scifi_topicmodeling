 NARRATOR : Three months ago , David Vincent had come to the Carver Oil Fields in Houston . There had been reports of unexplained lights , and that same night , two watchmen had been found dead . The verdict in both cases : cerebral haemorrhage . [ SPACESHIP WHIRRING ] Now , suddenly , after endless nights of vigil in the Carver Fields , David has found proof that the invaders are here . [ CAMERA CLICKING ] [ PANEL BEEPING ] [ CAMERA CLICKING ] [ DISPLAY HUMMING ] [ DEVICE WHIRRING ] ANNOUNCER : The Invaders . A Quinn Martin production . Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . NARRATOR : The invaders : alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination : the Earth . Their purpose : to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road , looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . ANNOUNCER : The guest stars in tonight 's story : Laura Devon , Nancy Wickwire , Norman Fell , and special guest star Ed Begley . Tonight 's episode : " The Betrayed . " NARRATOR : David Vincent has found proof that the invaders are here . Minutes after dark , he seeks out Simon Carver , owner of the enormously successful Carver Oil Company . Now , finally , three months of waiting and watching are about to pay off . CARVER : What is it ? What 's going on here ? - What are you doing here ? - Please let me in . I have to talk to you . - It 's 5 : 00 in the morning . - This is urgent . Henry . Henry . HENRY : Mr. Vincent , just a moment- - - Hello , Henry . Okay , Vincent , what is this ? I know how this is gonna sound , but you 've gotta get the security guards out to Field 1 right away . Do what ? Sir , I don 't have time to explain this to you fully . Make time . Listen , pal , you come breaking in here raving like a lunatic , you better have a reason . - I have . Right here . - What 's that supposed to be ? - A computer tape . - So ? I found it inside an abandoned tank car in Field 1 . The car 's equipped with a lot more than just a computer . Vincent , now I know you 're out of your skull . There 's nothing in that tank car except rust . It 's been sitting- - What I saw won 't make sense . But once you 've seen it , you 'll understand . Now , let 's call the guards . Beat it . In there . - We don 't have time . - I said , in there . You 've been on the hairy edge of being canned since I hired you . Now , give it to me straight or you 've had it . This tape is proof that the two men who were killed in Field 1- - Killed ? What are you talking about ? They weren 't killed . Two cerebral haemorrhages in the same night , the same area . Come on , Mr. Carver . They were healthy men . They were killed because they knew about this tape . - David ? - Oh , come in . Come in . - Join us . We 'll have a party . - What 's going on ? Tell her . Maybe it 'll make sense to her . Where did Evelyn put those pills ? Right-hand drawer . I hired you to design a plant , not to give me some cock-and-bull about my guards . I 'm not asking you to believe it without seeing evidence . I can prove it , so give me that chance . Henry . - Yes , Mr. Carver ? - Get me some clothes . Yes , sir . Hello , Sam ? Round up the guards . Meet me at Field 1 , on the siding . Yes , now . Dad , you 're not going out ? He asked for his chance , I 'll give it to him . DAVID : My car is outside . Mind if I put my pants on ? David , he shouldn 't be going out at this hour . What 's so important ? You 'll have an explanation when I get back . You do some very peculiar things , you know ? You want an apology , I apologise . I love your charming manners . And I love it when you take me out , then leave me at 8 or 9 : 00 whenever you have something better to do . Susan , I 've had to . - You 'll know why when I get back . - I don 't have to- - CARVER : I thought you were so hopped up to get going . - I 'll explain it to you when I get back . - It 's really much more fun this way . Well ? EVELYN : Good morning . - Mr. Vincent . DAVID : Miss Bowers . Evelyn , you 're dressed . You didn 't have to get up . - Anything wrong , Mr. Carver ? - I 'll tell you when I get back . Susan , where are they going ? Well , they 're having a convention on Field 1 . I 've been your father 's secretary long enough to get used to things like this , but 5 : 00 . You got me out at 5 : 00 in the morning to look into this rusty , beat-up old tank car ? What am I supposed to do , drop in a dime and make a wish ? It 's not the same car . Vincent , this car has been here ever since we abandoned this spur . Here , let 's go . And you , I wanna see you later this morning in my office . - Will you listen to me- - ? - I 've listened . I 've come . I 've had it . At my office . Mr. Taft ? What is it ? FBI ? FCC ? - Licensing commission ? - No , no , nothing like that . I got it . You 're a private investigator . My name is David Vincent . I may have a job for you . What is it , Charlie ? Think your wife 's cheating ? I have a special job . - Computer tape ? - You tell me . - It 's your primary field . - What makes you think so ? I started out this morning at NASA headquarters and the university . I asked for a name , I got yours . My former bosses , huh ? You left out a few , you know . You 're a specialist in cryptography . The government used you to break liberated tapes , find out what the tapes are for , what machines they control . And they fired me , as did the university , as you must know . You were fired for breaking rules . - For nonconformity . - But never inefficiency . I need this tape decoded . Oh , when I tell you my price , pal , you may change your mind . Well , as friend to friend , what side of the law am I on ? You don 't have to worry about the law . But I should tell you one thing . If anybody finds out where this tape is , your life won 't be worth a cent . Keep it , pal . That 's the kind of trouble I don 't need . You 'll be safe as long as I don 't know where you are . Take the tape and disappear . I 'm the one they 're looking for . If I can 't tell them , how can they find you ? All right , the school can live without me . I 'll meet you tonight at 10 : 00 . Now , this is 26th and Maple . At 10 : 00 tonight , start walking south , past the storage tank . If there 's nobody following you , I 'll pick you up . All right , 10 : 00 . [ DAVID GRUNTS ] [ PANTING ] You 've stolen something from us , Mr. Vincent . It isn 't here in your room . I 'd appreciate knowing where it is . The tape , Mr. Vincent , if you please . I don 't have it . The tape , where is it ? [ DEVICE WHIRRING ] - I don 't know . - Mr. Vincent , the tape . - I don 't have it . - Who ? Who has it now ? Who ? DAVID : Neal Taft . - Who is Neal Taft ? - Taft School of Electronics . Thank you , Mr. Vincent . [ DAVID GRUNTS ] [ CAR DOORS CLOSE ] [ CAR STARTS ] [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] David . - What- - ? - What are you doing here ? When you didn 't show up at Dad 's office , I was worried in spite of myself . - What happened ? - Get out of here . - They might come back . - Who ? Who did this ? Don 't ask questions . Just leave , please . No , you 're in trouble . The way you acted about that tape this morning . This has something to do with that tape , doesn 't it ? Yes . - David , what is it ? - Now , please just leave . No . Tell me . This ties in with where you went every night , doesn 't it ? Why you 'd leave me . You know , for a while , I thought there was someone else , another girl . Oh , David , if you 're in trouble , you should have told me . I 'd help you no matter what it is . - I think- - - Don 't- - What did you think I was gonna say , that I love you ? I do . I guess I do love you . Susan , you 've got to trust me . If I told you what was going on now , you wouldn 't understand . It wouldn 't make sense . I 'm gonna meet someone who 's gonna give me the proof I need . Then I 'll tell you . Now , go home . Wait for me . [ SUSAN CHUCKLES ] David . [ DOOR OPENS , CLOSES ] Susan ? Oh , Susan , could I see you for a moment , please ? In the morning , Evelyn , do you mind ? - Is my father still at the club ? - It 's really very important , Susan . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to ask a favour of you , Susan . Your friend , Mr. Vincent , has something I need . Something very important . What is all the cloak-and-dagger ? What 's David mixed up in ? I can 't tell you . Are you trying to make me believe he 's a spy or something ? I don 't believe it . And I don 't think my father would- - Don 't call your father , Susan , because if you do- - In the year I 've been here , I 've found out about Carver Oil . Even how he managed to build one useless oil well into an empire . I have some facts , Susan , about a man named Arnold Mayer . And they 're not very pleasant . I really wouldn 't like to use them . Your father 's not a young man . His heart condition couldn 't stand the strain of a scandal like this . Now what do you say ? You want me to inform on David ? [ CHUCKLING ] Oh , you make it sound so terrible . After all , it 's not much of a price to pay for your father 's life . TAFT : Vincent . Relax . - You look terrible . - I had some visitors . - Those kind of friends I don 't need . - What 'd you come up with ? Hey , look , I 've been in this business a long time . You give my name ? Not voluntarily . That 's why I insisted upon not knowing where you were . It 'll save your life and mine . They won 't kill anybody till they get that tape . Look , my car 's right over here . I 'm not too thrilled about meeting your friends in case they 're still looking . Let 's ride . Dad ? CARVER : Something tells me I 've got trouble . Vincent ? - No . - Oh , don 't tell me no . He doesn 't show up to see me today , you go to see him and I come home from the club and find you sitting in the dark like a piece of furniture . Dad , who 's Arnold Mayer ? I thought we were talking about Vincent . You were . Who 's Arnold Mayer ? Where did you find out about him ? It doesn 't matter . Dad , tell me . Arnold Mayer was my partner . I had a well that wasn 't practical . He had a technique for bringing it in . And how did you get his technique from him ? Did he sell it to you ? Is that any of your business ? It 's true , then . I know how you got it . And I know what he did to himself after you stole it from him . Well , if you know that , then there must be something else you want to ask . Why did I do it ? Go on , ask it . Don 't you want to know who I did it for ? [ SOBBING ] I know . I know who you did it for . Don 't jump me , Vincent . I just said I couldn 't crack the language . Actually , there 's something else on the tape . Numbers . Equations . The universal language . The only language that doesn 't shift from country to country or planet to planet . What do you mean , " planet to planet " ? Well , try this on . On the tape , let 's say there are , what , 100 coordinates . Now , those numbers could represent longitude-latitude intersections . And if I 'm right , the very first intersection is somewhere right here in Houston . Somewhere near the Carver Oil Field . That grabs you , huh ? What else ? The pattern on the tape is the same as one we used when , uh , well , when NASA was paying my room rent . We used it to activate a homing control that governed reentries of space capsules . I got somebody at the university now checking into the equations to make sure I 'm not going off halfcocked . - Wait a minute . - Don 't worry about him . He can keep his mouth shut . It 's my brother , Joey . I 'll tell you what you do : Tomorrow afternoon sometime , call my answering service . Let them know where you 'll be tomorrow night . I 'll have my brother Joey pick you up . Now , we better get back . I got a long way to go on that tape . EVELYN : Good afternoon , Susan . I hope you had a pleasant sleep . Susan , I know you talked to your father last night about Arnold Mayer . Look , Evelyn , I don 't know what it is you 're after . Or why . All I want is the present address of a friend of Mr. Vincent 's . A man named Neal Taft . That , and what they 've done with a certain computer tape . That 's all . That 's the whole deal , I swear . You know something ? I don 't think you have the nerve to expose my father . Where would you be once the scandal broke ? You 'd be out of a job , out of the house , and out of all the nice fringe benefits that seem to go with it . All right , try me . Ruin your father just because you resent me . It 's entirely up to you . All right , Evelyn , I 'll do what I can . Thank you , Susan . Oh , it won 't be too hard . Just call Mr. Vincent . Arrange to have a quiet dinner someplace where you can talk . [ PIANO PLAYING MELLOW MUSIC ] DAVID : What 's wrong ? Nothing . Could we go ? You asked me to meet you here , now you wanna leave . I know , I just- - I guess I just don 't like this place . Well , I 'm expecting a phone call . Very good . Could you pour later , please ? Yes , sir . Something is wrong . No , it 's just that you gave me an awful shock last night . David , I can 't believe that you 're involved in something dishonest . But if this is what happens because of that tape , get rid of it . Can 't you go to the police ? I don 't have the tape . What did you do with it ? - I can 't tell you . - You must know where it is . - No . - You must know . - There 's a call for you , Mr. Vincent . - Thank you . Yes ? Behind what theatre ? All right , the Fannin Street parking lot . I 'll see you in 15 minutes . You don 't have to bother taking me home . I 'll call Dad and have him send a car . - Susan , I 'm sorry . - It 's all right . Go , please . In 15 minutes , some theatre parking lot on Fannin Street . That would be the Imperial , I guess . No , don 't thank me , Evelyn . Please , don 't thank me . - Mr. , uh , Vincent ? - That 's right . Why don 't we talk in the car ? - You were , uh , supposed to be alone . - In the car , please . JOEY : What- - ? What are you doing ? Let go of me . What are you doing ? What are you looking for ? - Nothing . - I don 't have anything on me . [ CAR STARTS ] Joey ? Joey Taft ? Why would- - ? Why would they do that ? Listen , tell- - Tell my brother ... that I- - I tried to do ... Joey ? Joey , where is your brother ? He 's , uh- - Uh , he 's at the university , in- - In my lab . CARVER : I said , come in here . - Where did you go ? - I had to see David . I said , come in . I have to go up to New Orleans . I wanna set you straight on what you asked last night before I go . Sit down . - Dad , I 'd like to go to bed . - Please . If you 're gonna talk about Arnold Mayer , please don 't . I 'm the last person in the world to sit in judgement . Any explanation I could give you , Susan , would be just a lot of words . What I did , I did . I stole the formula . Arnold Mayer killed himself . I can 't change that . It took me years of sleepless nights , too much bourbon , too many pills to realise that . I send Arnold Mayer 's wife money all the time . Nothing can ever wipe out the stink of what I did . I though that was dead , Susan . Buried . But now somebody wants to make trouble . And whoever it is , can . Big trouble . I want to know who told you . You 're safe . You can forget about Arnold Mayer . How ? I did something tonight . Let 's just say Simon Carver and his daughter , Susan , can go back to living the way they always lived . You don 't have to worry about anybody making any trouble for you . You don 't have to worry about David Vincent . Still in surgery . They can 't tell me anything . [ TAFT SIGHS ] Well , Vincent , you better tell me who ran down my brother . I can 't give you a name . Well , you better give me something , pal . The men who attacked your brother , they weren 't from here . They were from somewhere else . Listen to me . The military power of this world depends on fuel . The source of fuel : crude oil . Now , suppose you wanted to invade and conquer this Earth and you had some other source of power . What the devil are you talking about ? If you could destroy our fuel supplies , planes wouldn 't fly , ships wouldn 't sail , we 'd be disabled . You could attack without fear of retaliation- - Attack from where ? Outer space . - From where , pal ? - You know it 's possible . I 'm saying it 's true . Oh , for the love of Mike . Neal , that tape was intended to bring in something special , either equipment or- - Or one of their specialists . That tank car is a homing device . They must move it in whenever one of their saucers is coming down . Their last beachhead was Carver 's Oil Field . They killed those two guards and they ran down your brother . Let me tell you something , Vincent . I 'm getting sick and tired of hearing about " they . " Now , you 're protecting somebody that knew about our meeting . Who was with you at the Blue Lion when I called ? Who ? Susan . MAN : Mr. Taft ? Yeah . [ MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] Vincent . My brother just died . My brother just died . You have some funny habits . Breaking in in the middle of the night is one you can keep . I wanna see Susan . Maybe you 're not as smart as I thought . Whatever happened tonight , whatever you two did , - you 're not gonna clean it up . - Does she come down or do I go up ? You go one place , buster , and that 's out . It 's all right , Dad . This is between David and me . Go ahead . You 've got a plane to catch . It 's all right . It 's your life . - Henry . - Yes , Mr. Carver ? - Let 's go . - Yes , sir . [ DOOR OPENS ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] David , I told Dad that I didn 't wanna see you anymore and I meant it . Is that something you decided after we had dinner tonight ? Why can 't you just accept it and leave ? Accept it the way I did when you said you loved me ? That was a mistake . So why don 't we just call it quits ? Now that you 've got what you 're after . I won 't even ask you what you mean by that . - I hope you had a successful meeting . - There was no meeting . - Why , didn 't your friend show up ? - Who ? The man who called you . Taft . I never told you his name . Well , you must have . Taft showed up , but it was the wrong one . Now he 's dead . A boy . Oh , David . - Who did you tell ? - Just get out of here , David , please . [ SUSAN SOBBING ] The kid 's name was Joey . I want you to remember that . His name was Joey . You 're right . This siding checks out with the coordinates on the tape . Now , if your story is right , this could be a landing field . Now , you know the top men at NASA . Take the tape to them and all the information you have . Convince them . Just like that ? I was canned . For nonconformity , remember ? Do you think they 're gonna believe a story like this , especially from me ? How many chances are we gonna get before they wipe out the human race ? Oh , sure , sure , sure . We 're gonna stop them , you and me . Maybe we won 't . But this is the one chance you 'll have to find who killed your brother . Okay . All right , I 'll try . But how do we find out when ? Susan . Who are they ? Friends . Oh , and they 're just as unhappy about last night as I am . Our superiors are even more unhappy . It wasn 't my fault . I got your information . We 're not blaming you , Susan . It was a mistake . - This time we 'll be more careful . SUSAN : This time ? We have a schedule to meet by tonight . If that schedule is cancelled , then our work is set back for a year , maybe two . We can 't afford that . SUSAN : Who are you ? Just who are you , anyway ? I asked you a question . Whether or not we can meet that schedule tonight depends on what Mr. Vincent or Mr. Taft have learned . What danger they represent . Find that out for us and you 'll be free . How can I go to David after last night ? He knows what I did . He 'd never trust me now . He might . After all , he called you , said he wanted to see you . - I kept my end of the bargain . - You don 't understand . I 've been made aware that I failed . And if I fail again , I die . And if I die , you die , and so does your father . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Was gonna give you ten more minutes . I 've been driving for an hour , trying to find some way I wouldn 't have to come here , but there isn 't . David , I know what you must think of me . And it isn 't gonna do any good to apologise because it 's gonna be worse in a minute , but you 've gotta help me . I don 't know what you 're trying to do , but forget it . A man died because of you . Don 't you think I know that ? But you 've gotta help me , David . If you don 't , my father 's gonna die . - What ? - She 'll have it done , I know she will . - Who ? - Evelyn . There isn 't time to ask questions . You 've gotta tell me . - I have to know tonight . - Know what ? There 's something that 's gonna happen tonight and it 's so important . I have to know what you found out from the tape , if you 're a danger to them , if you can stop them . - Are they waiting for you ? - Yes . - Where ? - At the house . David , I have to bring them the truth . If I don 't , they 'll find out if I 'm lying . - Please tell me . - Do they have your father yet ? No , he 's at a meeting in New Orleans . Then he 's safe for now . Susan . Don 't go home . Call Evelyn . Tell her we don 't know anything . We couldn 't decode the tape . - Is that the truth ? - No , but make her believe you . They 've gotta go through with their plans . Tell her the tape is in a safe in Taft 's office . I 'll make sure it 's there . That 'll convince her . But promise me you won 't go back to the house . Take a plane . Disappear for a couple of days . If they go through with it , you 'll know when it 's safe to return . Go to the airport to make that call . And then get the first plane you can get . I know it doesn 't make any difference now , but there was one thing I wasn 't lying about . I do love you . Be careful . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Come in . Well ? Better call your friend at NASA . It 's happening tonight . WOMAN [ OVER P.A. ] : Regina Airlines . Jet Flight Number 5 from Honolulu now arriving at Gate 32 . Could I have Operator 216 , please ? Operator , this is Susan Carver . Could you try my call again to New Orleans ? I 've been trying for over half an hour , and my plane leaves in five minutes . Thank you . Hello ? Could I talk to Simon Carver , please ? Yes , I know he 's in a meeting . It 's urgent . This is his daughter . Thank you . Dad ? Listen , Dad , you 've got to do something . Now , get out of that meeting as fast as you can and don 't tell anybody where you 're going . Not anybody . And get on a plane and meet me at the Mirador in Mexico City . Now , you 've got to do it , Dad . I 'll explain later . Look , Dad , I love you and your life is in danger . Do you promise ? I 'll explain everything then . All right . WOMAN [ OVER P.A. ] : Last call , Flight 421 for Mexico City . EVELYN : Susan . - What are you doing here ? I told you what you wanted to know . I told you where you could find that tape . You said that Mr. Vincent found out nothing . We simply want to check that . What time did they tell you they 'd be here ? They 're due any minute . Vincent . Susan . They found her . - They know she lied . - No , they don 't know . They wouldn 't have come here . They 'd have called off the landing . Well , then they 'll find out in a minute and that 's that . We 've gotta get to her . Just the two of us ? Are you crazy ? Look , the NASA people and the FBI are due here any minute . - Wait for them . - I know what they 'll do to her . Well , you can 't help her . If you go in there now , she 'll be killed for sure . I told you , he doesn 't know anything . MAN : Why did you run ? Is that so hard to understand ? I was scared . They 're already inside the lunar orbit . If there 's any question about bringing in the ship , I must know within three minutes or I can 't turn her back . Miss Carver , you 've told us the truth ? They know nothing ? [ DEVICE WHIRRING ] - Yes . - We must have the truth . - David knows nothing . - Absolutely nothing ? Yes , nothing . Nothing ? They know . They know . Turn the ship back now . Path reversed . Ship rising . Activate the destruct cycles and abandon control . Quick , before the radiation reaches the critical level . - What about the girl ? - She 's finished . DAVID : They do know . [ DEVICE WHIRRING ] Susan . [ SUSAN GASPING ] Susan . Susan . I can 't- - I can 't- - - Oh , David . - Susan . Oh , David . Susan . They 're here . It 's too late . I just don 't understand any of it . I just don 't understand . I can 't expect you to . I know one thing : she was special . What she did was special . Goodbye . Vincent , she did love you . How is he ? Well , he 's tough . - He 'll make it . - How about you ? I 'll make it too . David , if there 's anything I can do ... Thank you . How about taking me to the airport , huh ? [ ENGINE STARTS ] NARRATOR : A girl 's life . For David Vincent , a very personal reason why the war must go on . Why the world must be alerted . Why the invader must be destroyed .

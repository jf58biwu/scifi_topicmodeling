 What sounds like a fairy tale today , may be tomorrow 's reality . Here 's a fairy tale from the day after tomorrow . There are no more nations . Only humanity and its colonies in space . Distant stars have been settled . The ocean beds are inhabited . Space ships cross the galaxy at unimaginable speeds . One such ship is the Orion . A small link in a great chain of defense against threats from space . Let 's join Orion and her crew on patrol at the edges of infinity ... 6 . The Space Trap Subtitles by Anders M Olsson Great McLane , we 're all done . - All done , once again . - Once again ? It 's the second time you 're sending me away for light pressure spores . Can I help that the Office for Space Exploration is so anxious about it ? - I 'll slowly become a botanist . - Are you familiar with the panspermia hypothesis ? No , but I 'm sure you 'd like to share your knowledge . The theory is that life didn 't emerge on Earth , but was transfered from another planet in meteorite cracks , by light pressure from the sun - or by solar storms . - Interesting . If you would pick up dust samples from spore currents ... Is that advisable ? Why not ? The samples may belie the entire panspermia hypothesis , in which case you 'd lose your only subject of conversation . Very funny , Major . Well , the mission is important , and your joke is somewhat inappropriate . So off you go , and happy spore-hunting ! Thanks , General . General ... The request from the Supreme Commander . Oh yes . Commander , there 's one more thing . The Supreme Commander would like a small favor . Would he really ? Does the name Peter Paul Ibsen mean anything to you ? I 've heard the name , but ... Famous author , recipient of the Utopia award . Oh you mean " Piepo " ? Yes , I 've read a few of his books . Science fiction or what 's it 's name . Pure nonsense . His novels are world famous . Doesn 't bode well , but I guess it takes all kinds . What does that have to do with me ? The Supreme Commander wants you to take Ibsen along to Umbriel . Spring-Brauner , it 's not your idea , is it ? Ibsen is engaged to the daughter of a minister . The minister is a former schoolmate of the Supreme Commander . Ibsen would like to gain experience , and collect material for a novel . Does he now ? And of all ships , it had to be mine . So it 's going to be both spores and material for a novel ? Not for the life of me . Let him buy a multi-use ticket to Mars . He wants experience . Someone must have recommended you . And you 're famous , McLane . You 'll address me as " Commander ! " And if I refuse ? You can do that if you 'd like to put me in an embarrassing situation . When I tell the crew , they will go hog wild . Base 104 , take-off at 12 : 27 , Orion 8 . Platform 4 . Countdown minus 320 . Cyrus 29 , standby in area 9 ! You 'll be clear to land in approximately 12 minutes . - He can 't be serious . - The Supreme Commander usually is . It always happens to us . Piepo , that liar . In his novels , humans control the space-time leap . If he enters engineering , I 'll hit him on the head . - He might be quite nice . - What an optimist . It 's a scandal ! Secret Service should have been informed ! Nothing worse ? Departure in 5 minutes . Is the computer ready ? Yes . The first phase has been programmed . So what are we waiting for ? We 'll leave on schedule , with or without the great poet . Not to worry . I 'm here now . Here 's my new novel , hot off the press . That 's why I 'm late . Would you like a dedication ? Peter Paul Ibsen reporting for duty ! Your luggage ? Already in cabin 9 as instructed . How did you find your way ? I 've prepared by studying the ship 's drawings . I thought the drawings were classified . Mr. Ibsen seems to be a man of connections . Let me introduce the crew , Mr. Ibsen . Just call me Piepo ! - Lieutenant Jagellovsk ... - I already know who they are . I 've done my homework . So what are you doing here , if you already know everything ? In theory , yes . But in practice I 've got a lot to learn . Let 's take off . Man your stations ! Activate the control center ! Guide beam at its initial coordinates ! Orion calling base 104 . Ready for take-off ! Base 104 calling Orion 8 . Automatic launch at countdown minus one . 104 releases control to space station 3 . Understood ! Thank you , base 104 ! Where may I sit ? Lieutenant Jagellovsk , do any special security measures apply to Ibsen ? You 're the boss . It pleases me that you admit that . Take Sigbj√∂rnson 's seat for now ! You 're well prepared . Normal take-off . Receiving guide beam from space station 104 . Out . Are you happy with it ? - Yes , why ? - In a few years , it will be scrap metal . Multiple functions will be combined into one computer . - Yes , you should know . - That 's inevitable progress . I described that as far back as four years ago in a novel . Excuse me , I need to go freshen up . - Arrogant whelp . - He 's not so bad . - No one says otherwise . - Handsome man . The two ladies won 't be needed until we reach our destination . Women are such suckers . Exactly my thought when I saw you with two girls at the Starlight Casino . Don 't be jealous ! It 's amazing that you can make up such stories ! - Mostly it 's a drudgery . - With your imagination ? You 're painting a romantic picture . It 's hard work , just like yours . People imagine space travel as an adventure , when in reality it 's , apart from your lovely company , quite monotonous . Monotonous ? Such nonsense . Cliff , why don 't you find a way to make his journey more pleasant ? Like hell I won 't . We can 't afford to sneak up on the son-in-law of a minister . It 's been a row right from the beginning . My daughter wouldn 't let Ibsen leave . Women ! Imagining all kinds of dangers . The mission is completely harmless . Aren 't there two women on board ? There 's no need to worry , Sir . Lieutenant Legrelle is constantly in love with McLane - secretly of course . And as for Tamara Jagellovsk , many crewmen doubt that she 's a woman at all , and not a very attractive robot . Is it possible to contact the Orion by lightwave ? A greeting from Peter Paul would set my daughter at ease . The connection is unfortunately broken at the moment . Broken ? Since when ? Since last night . Station 1 has lost contact . But that 's ... terrible ! - What shall I tell my daughter ? - It 's only a temporary glitch . Happens now and then . Keep me posted ! Let 's hope it will soon be repaired . If not , you 'll put me in an awkward situation . - Still nothing ? - No , we 're cut off . Must be cosmic interference . I 'll have to be content with that . Commander 's log . I haven 't been able to reach the Space Patrol . We 're approaching the area for spore collection . End . Everything ready ? We 'll gather the meteoritic dust magnetically . With some luck , we 'll collect enough spores to keep the scientists busy for a year . Commander ? May I ask something ? Anything , Sir ! Down there is an asteroid , 20,000 kilometers from Umbriel . And ... ? Why go to all the trouble of gathering small particles ? Because spores can 't be caught like butterflies . One single rock from that asteroid may save a full day 's work . You 're right about that . Yes , you 've got a point . I 'm happy to be of service . Then it 's easier for me to ask for something . Something I 've always wanted . I 'm sorry , but the two ladies are indispensable right now . No , for once in my life , I 'd like to pilot a shuttle . You 're crazy ! I earned top scores at a course on autopilot four weeks ago . Sure you did , but that 's only theory . Anyone can hop around on a guide beam . It 's basically the same . For me it 's about the feeling of space flight . You and your feelings . Please , grant my wish ! I 'll be forty on the day after tomorrow . Are you sure you can handle it ? In my books , they are already old technology . In your books , people travel by teleportation . Just a trip to the asteroid . If it 's a problem , you may log that I 've left without authorization . Alright . Lieutenant di Monti will accompany you . Please let me go alone ! - Not on my responsibility . - Just me and the universe , that 's my dream . - What a romantic . - Nothing wrong with that . Lieutenant Legrelle , your duty on board is space surveillance . Judgment of male charm will have to wait for your free time . Please , I 'd really love to . It 's completely harmless . Alright , anything for some peace and quiet . It 's on your own risk . Thank you very much ! Mario , prepare shuttle 1 ! Launching chamber 1 ready ! Space surveillance , stand by for shuttle 1 ! It never occurred to you to ask me , your security officer ? You 've been on my mind ever since Ibsen came aboard . - What do you mean ? - I mean ... never mind . I take it back and apologize . Your private feelings are none of my business . Shuttle 1 ready for launch . Away with it ! Good luck , Mr. Ibsen ! Hearty thanks , Commander ! - You shouldn 't have let him go . - It 's completely harmless . He can 't leave his guide beam . Commander , I 'm disappointed . The guide beam would even let the shuttle fly unmanned . I 'm no kid . Taking over controls now . No you don 't , Ibsen ! Don 't you get it ? I 'll stay on course . Don 't worry ! - He 's deviating . - What a fool ! Ibsen , what are you doing ? Stay on course ! - He 's heading for the moon of Umbriel . - Nice place . Ibsen , do you read ? I read you . The shuttle is a bit fickle . I 'm off course , I don 't know why . Can you see me on the radar ? Hello , McLane ? Do you read ? Requesting course correction ! Hello Ibsen ? I don 't read you anymore . Do you read ? - The radar echo is gone . - So is the radio connection . - Perhaps he 's ashamed . - I wonder who 's more ashamed ? He must have touched down on Umbriel . - Dangerous ? - No , just desolate . A godforsaken pile of gravel . I don 't fancy picking him up there . - Why doesn 't he report ? - He 's probably busy landing . Peter Paul Ibsen in shuttle 1 calling the Orion . Commander McLane ? Peter Paul Ibsen to the log . I 'm mysteriously off course , and has touched down on an unknown asteroid . Deviation 12 degrees . Attempting to return to the Orion . Ibsen to the log . The take-off was unsuccessful . The engines work , but something ties me to the ground . I 'll try the emergency take-off . Since I 'm out of touch with the Orion , I 'll keep on recording . The emergency take-off failed as well . The asteroid has an Earth-like atmosphere . I 'll go out and examine the ground . The problem probably lies there . End . Who are you ? What do you want ? What are you doing ? Are you out of your mind ? I guess he 's only trying to scare us . I don 't think Ibsen is as childish as you . Helga defends the poet by tooth and nail . - Her motherly instinct awakens . - But he 's turning 40 tomorrow . Stop your bullying ! I 'm sure there 's an explanation . Impressive logic , Major . But what 's the explanation ? Orion 8 calling Ibsen . Ibsen , please respond ! Ibsen ! And where is the Orion ? In the proximity of Umbriel . I don 't know its exact position . Any lies will be punished . How many people are on board ? Myself and six more . Under whose command ? Under Major McLane . Formerly of the Fast Combat Units ? Yes . But what do you want ? Answer my questions ! Is the Orion a large ship ? - Yes . - Model ? Alpha 3 . Specially equipped . Excellent . You may now speak with the Orion . You 'll tell them that you 've landed on Mura due to a malfunction . What 's Mura ? Tell them that you can 't take off on your own , and that you want them to pick you up . Understood ? Understood ? ! Proceed ! Will you talk now ? Your fine head is right between two needle-thin omicron beams . Pretty hot , aren 't they ? We keep them 15 millimeters from your skin . But that may change . I 'll speak to McLane . - I 'll tell them what you want . - Excellent . No need to tell you what will happen if you try to warn him . Ibsen , please respond ! - No use waiting any longer . - We 'll have to go get him . Atan , change course for Umbriel ! Hasso , engines plus ten ! Willy-nilly . Plus ten ! Cliff , we 're being hailed on channel 3 ! - Peter Paul Ibsen calling Orion ! - Finally . What 's happened ? I had to land on Mura . Sector N72918 . What are you doing there ? We thought you were on Umbriel . Malfunctioning controls . You must pick me up . Are you hurt ? Your voice sounds funny . Is something wrong ? Ibsen ? What 's happening ? Where are you ? I 'm in the administrative building at the colony . Is everything else OK ? Everything 's OK , Commander . Over and out . Well done , Ibsen . We 'll grant you a short break . Tamara ? Yes . Sorry to bother you , but I need to talk to you . It 's nothing controversial . Would you check if we 're allowed to land on Mura ? I know that straight off . Only Secret Service and supply ships may land there without top level clearance . So landing is prohibited . That 's all I wanted to know . On the other hand , if we return without Ibsen , my head will roll . And you won 't be too happy either . So ... What do you recommend ? I know that you 'd like to leave Ibsen on Mura where he 'll have to wait six months for a transport home . What I would like is beside the point . It 's your call . - I 'm really inclined to ... - I don 't care either way . Then land on my responsibility . Really ? - May I ? - Be my guest . Atan ! Set course for Mura ! Prepare for landing ! Course for Mura ! Do you really miss him that much ? Any more questions ? Yes . Tell me ... Is it really as bad on Mura as it used to be in Siberia ? It 's not an idyll , but people are well off . They are autonomous , and allowed to move around freely . Rather humane . Is it humane to banish people for life from Earth ? We used to have prisons and capital punishment . So they are big time criminals ? Not as such . Unwanted individuals . Notorious and famous people . Then Ibsen will fit in perfectly . Both famous and unwanted . Cliff , we 're approaching the landing ellipsis of Mura . Prepare for landing ! I 'm coming . Piepo awaits ! - Distance ? - 5,000 . Set up resonance contact ! Resonance contact . Engines off ! Done . Report when we 've reached the target coordinates ! Coming in on the computer . Engineering , full deceleration ! Relative velocity zero . - Float landing cushions ! - Done ! Entrance down ! Stand by for disembarkation ! Atan and Helga stay on guard . - The others will get off . - Cliff , we 're being hailed . The administrative center on Mura calling McLane . Do you read ? - I do . - Turn on your videophone ! - Ibsen , for God 's sake ... - You can see his predicament . Everyone must leave the ship , unarmed , one at a time . The slightest resistance , and Ibsen goes up in flames . Do you understand ? No discussions ! Don 't try to leave anyone behind ! We know how many you are . Get going ! Commander to the crew . Leave one by one . No resistance ! Get out ! Quicker ! Speed it up ! Get in here ! Stop ! Get in there ! Stay here ! Cliff , they want to separate us . Damned swine ! Easy , Hasso . Get in there ! Keep going ! Welcome to Mura , Commander McLane . Who are you ? What 's this supposed to mean ? Please take a seat ! Your friend Ibsen has spent a few unpleasant hours in that chair . Let 's hope it won 't be needed with you . You 're rumored to be an intelligent man . Who are you ? By what authority ... One thing at a time . It 's nice to be able to welcome you here . Enough of this nonsense . What do you want ? I thought Mura was an ... An exile . You can say it ! A colony of damned , of outcasts . You 're quite right . It is . But not much longer . - Where did you get weapons ? - A good question . It wasn 't easy . It took us years to find a weak link within the authorities on Earth . A department manager at supplies accepted bribes . It all began with euphorine pills . Later , he couldn 't deny us weapons . One word from us , and he too would have ended up on Mura . I 'll catch him . Hardly , Major McLane . You don 't think we 'll let you return to Earth , do you ? How dare you ... Dare ? The only thing I don 't dare is to release you . What do you intend to do ? It 's a great day for Mura . A historic event . We 've waited patiently for this day . And it was an act of providence that you came along . What do you want ? The Orion , of course ! Hijacking any passing freighter would have been of no use . We had to wait for a large , modern spaceship . Waiting is hard on Mura . But it 's paid off on a grand scale . Not even I would have dared to hope for the Orion . - What will you use it for ? - We 're going to leave for good . Mura will become what it was , before the Earth started to resettle its unwanted individuals here . An insignificant pebble in the desert of the universe . Where will you go ? The Earth doesn 't want us . Perhaps someone else appreciates us more . You 're going to ... No , it can 't be . Why not ? In your eyes , aliens are disgusting beasts . You call them frogs . On Mura , we think differently . We hate you , just as you hate them . You 're going to the frogs ? You must be mad . I 'm already considered mad on Earth , but they are mistaken . Your name is Tourenne , isn 't it ? I 'm flattered . Yes , I was famous once . My stasis beam was a sensation . You endangered thousands of lives . That 's why you 're here . Forgotten on a desert planet like a leper , and why ? Just because my definition of ethics didn 't agree with theirs . The Earth didn 't want the stasis beam . Perhaps their interest will awaken , now when the others will have it . Give the weapon to the aliens ? Do you know what you 're saying ? Sending me away won 't go unpunished ! You can 't really wish for the demise of the human race ? No one on Mura wishes for anything more . - They should have killed you . - Wishful thinking . Let me give you tit for tat , but in a more forceful way . - What do you mean ? - I have no choice . I hate to kill you , you would have been useful . But you 're a hero of sorts , and as such you 're dangerous . You would always oppose me , that 's why you must die . - A victim of your own fame . - There 's no need to kill us . Just leave us here ! You know too much . The Earth mustn 't know that I 've defected . - Why then , are you telling me ? - Just for my own pleasure . - Your terrified face is priceless . - Dirty swine ! Don 't tempt my good will ! I intended to grant you a painless death . But that may change . So you 've got the nerve to tell me that you haven 't heard from the Orion in six days ? Would you prefer a lie ? - What shall I tell my daughter ? - That 's your problem . My problem is the lack of contact with the Orion . No more talk about interference ! That should be gone by now . No , it must be something else . It 's irresponsible to send my son-in-law with McLane . It wasn 't my idea . You wanted McLane , and no one else . You should have known better . You know McLane . Yes I do . He 's my best man . We 'll see about that . I have a feeling that it 's the ship they want . Why do you think so ? Ibsen whispered something like that in passing . Do you know what my first thought was ? Same as mine : Penal colony . Shortage of women . Ibsen might have revealed that there were two women on board . Thank God , that wasn 't the case . Did you see the way the two men looked at us ? Yes , it gives me the creeps . I almost feel sorry for one of them . So young , and committed to Mura . Not much longer . They are going to hit space with the Orion . Wait a moment ... We might use the Orion as a means of exerting pressure . Yes , but how ? Hasso and Mario are in the next cell . If we ... Keep quiet ! I 've got something important to tell you . What would that be ? News , young man . Nosy women aren 't appreciated here . Are you all that impolite to ladies ? There are no ladies here . Am I no lady ? You 're delaying me on patrol . Keep quiet , or you 'll get a taste of the stasis beam ! Will you administer it personally ? You 're a funny one . I almost feel sorry for you . How so ? - The time will soon be up . - For all of us ? Yes . - Do you have us all , then ? - What do you mean ? That 's my point . My colleague has escaped . Maybe you 'll put in a nice word for saying that . What ? ! Don 't move , or I 'll shoot ! We 've got nothing to lose . How many of you are there in the hallway ? - None at the moment . - Can you open the next cell ? Get out ! Go on ! Unlock it ! Hasso ! Atan ! Get in ! - We must get aboard the ship . - Take the gun ! - What should we do ? - They 've got the ship ... A single word from you will send you to heaven ahead of us . It 's been nice talking to you , McLane . You 're the last person from Earth that I 'll ever see in my life . And I 'm in luck . It might have been a more stupid person . I hate stupidity . Then you must hate yourself . On Earth , I 've often been considered evil . But " stupid " , - that 's new to me . - It 's nevertheless true . You 've made up a detailed plan , and forgotten the most important thing . What would that be ? How do you intend to fly the Orion without trained personnel ? You have no idea how many experts we 've got on Mura , all anxious to fly a spaceship once more . When was the last time they flew a large ship ? My best man joined us three years ago , after drowning his own astrogator . Three years ? He 'll be completely lost on board the Orion . Like asking an actor who 's played a doctor to perform real surgery . - Are you putting me on ? - Not at all . I 've got nothing more to lose . From my spot in heaven , I 'll enjoy watching you crash straight into the first meteorite you meet . Has that much been changed ? The engines are completely new . The controls were replaced shortly before we took off . You 're bluffing ! You 'll soon see for yourself . I 've kept a close watch on scientific developments . You know very well that three years is a long time . Give up , Tourenne ! You can kill me , but not impress me . You 're narrow-minded . You 'll have that back ! You 'll have that back with interest ! I don 't know if the frogs have a sense of humor . But if they do , they 'll laugh a lot at you . It 's a shame that you 're never going to get there . You ridiculous , mean old man . Proceed ! Make him sweat ! We can talk like this too , McLane . I know how to handle whelps like you . Closer with the beams ! It 's dark , McLane . I can see you very well . I can see the terrified look on your face . You still look just as miserable . Thus ends the life of a hero , in fear . Admit that you 're scared . Tell me that you 're scared ! Don 't hope for a quick death ! It will be just as slow as I want it to be . Now tell me that you 're scared ! Yes , I 'm scared of a ridiculous , mean old man ! Let him burn ! Alarm ! Four people from the Orion have escaped . They 've taken Hendryk hostage . Abort ! Well , McLane . I admit that you 've succeeded . Our conversation has bought your people time to act . It won 't help you much , though . On the contrary , it gives me an idea . Perhaps I do need you and your crew , but there 's one man I don 't need : Your Utopian poet , and he will die now , as a deterrent . Every time someone takes action against me , a crew member will die . The least important first . Next the woman from Secret Service , then the other girl , and so on . Finally yourself . Do you still think I 'm ridiculous ? Get the poet from his cell ! - Where 's the guard ? - In hibernation . Great ! We 'll need him as a witness . Prepare for emergency take-off , Hasso ! Not without the others . It 's our only chance . If we leave , they won 't dare to do anything , because they know that the space fleet is on its way . No , they may kill Cliff and Ibsen out of pure hatred . My dear McLane . I ask you to watch closely . The death of a human . I 'm sure you 've seen it before on your journeys . Still , I ask for your attention . In a way , you 'll see your own death . A carbon copy of your own death . So you 'll experience your death twice . A rare treat . A poet once said that not until death do you experience real life . By that token , I 'm giving you life twice . Aren 't you grateful ? Eternally . If I 'll ever get away , I will drown you in gin , so slowly that Ibsen 's death will seem like an act of mercy . Pity you 'll never get the opportunity . Proceed ! External call for the boss . Lightwave from the Orion . Channel 3 . I want to speak to the top villain ! The boss swine ! The main gangster ! Why don 't you respond ? Admit that you 're the biggest swine on Mura ! If you don 't , you 're in trouble ! - We 're on board the Orion . - What do you want ? I have supercharged the ship with energy . Do you know what that means ? What are you up to ? My people will ... I 'll release the energy unless our full crew is back on the Orion within 15 minutes . Ibsen too . Understood ? - Now listen . My people ... - I won 't listen ! Orion will blow up in 15 minutes , and take the entire colony along . And my watch is accurate to the second . We 've surrounded the Orion with a forcefield . We can ... There will be a bang in 15 minutes unless the crew gets back . Out . Looks like you 've won , McLane . So get going ! Leave , and take your crew along ! Do you really mean that we 're free ? I 've had a change of plans . You may understand at a later time . Off you go ! I promise to let everyone return to the ship unharmed . I wonder why the ship wasn 't guarded . I guess they didn 't expect us to escape . Four minutes to go . They are coming . - We made it ! - Yes . Hello Cliff ! Man your stations ! We must be off . Prepare for take-off ! - Ready ! - Return to Earth programmed . Let 's go , Hasso ! Departure ! Emergency take-off ! Cliff , what 's going on ? - Hasso , what 's wrong ? - I don 't get it . - The engines work alright . - Why can 't we lift off ? The same thing happened to me . Add sleeping energy ! - What ? That 's insane ! - We 'll have to take that risk . Cliff , look at this ! It 's an electromagnetic forcefield . Cliff , we 're losing power ! The forcefield drains our power . Mario , check the armoring power ! The transducer works at peak capacity , but the power disappears . Hasso , let 's try again . Think it over , Cliff ! We 've only got power for one more attempt . If that fails too , we 'll be stuck here . Cliff , the armoring is losing power too . It 's a trap . The harder we try , the stronger the forcefield . Yes . That 's why Tourenne gave up so easily . We must go out and find the generator . - Do you think they will allow that ? - Cliff , incoming call on video 3 . Hello McLane ! How are you doing ? Won 't you try to take off once more ? No ? Smart , because it would have been futile . I hope you appreciate our advanced technology . My experts aren 't such fools after all . Why this cat-and-mouse play ? Why do you release us , just to keep us here ? I simply couldn 't allow your rude engineer to blow up the Orion . Be reasonable , McLane ! I have a proposition . You 'll let my men aboard , and teach them the new technology . In exchange we 'll let you live . We 'll leave you here when we go . - How do I know that you 'll keep your word ? - You 'll have to trust me . Accept it ! We don 't have a choice . Send up your people ! Excellent ! And don 't bother looking for your weapons . We 've got them . - But we 've got this one . - The swine missed that one . It will be his demise . I 'll try to separate him from the others when I show him around . - Use the elevator . We can lock it . - You 're right . I 'll give him the works in there until he agrees to open the trap . Unless he 's got too many guards . - He thinks we 're unarmed . - It 's our last chance . - They 're coming ! - Give me the gun ! Hello McLane , we 're coming ! And no tricks ! We 're armed and you 're not . It worked . He didn 't notice anything . Wait for my sign ! So my friend . Who 's got the gun you snatched before ? What gun ? No nonsense . Do you take me for a fool ? I haven 't forgotten about the gun . So who 's got it ? If you don 't tell me , everyone will have to strip naked . The ladies too . Well , then . Let the demonstration begin . Go ahead , Commander McLane ! Out of the way ! I 'd better demonstrate a normal take-off . - Who 's the astrogator ? - I am . Then go watch the work at the computer ! You 'll go to engineering ! And I 'll have a look at the autopilot . Any requests of your own ? Yes , I 'll stay and keep an eye on you . - Man your station ! - Will do . My compliments , Tourenne ! The forcefield that surrounds us is a masterpiece . What 's its diameter ? Why ? I 'll demonstrate a take-off , and abort right below the forcefield . That will show you the precision of our autopilot . - Is that of interest to you ? - Of course , Boss . The field 's diameter is 580 meters , and its apex at 860 meters . Atan , calculate the approach angle for the apex ! - Why ? - Do as he says ! - No passive resistance , please ! - What 's the angle for ? For power leveling . Ibsen , have you ever used the concept of power exchange ? - Why yes , in a book ... - Enough talk ! Let 's get started ! Programming ready ? Ready . Commander to engineering . Stand by for take-off ! At countdown minus 5 , full acceleration of S1 ! What 's " S1 " ? Small particle accelerator . Your " experts " don 't know much . We 're here to learn . Commander to tactics . Why are you still here ? Man your station for take-off ! Stop , where are you going ? - To the tactics console . - Why ? The first phase is critical on a spaceship like this . We monitor the power consumption using two independent systems . That 's why the armoring energy has to be monitored from tactics . You 'll go along to keep him from getting any ideas . Hasso , is everything ready ? Ready ! Ready for take-off ! Mario ! Initiate countdown ! I thought the computer did that . Watch closely , you 'll understand in a moment ! What was that , McLane ? What are you doing ? Killing me now means suicide . Hasso , sleeping energy off ! Done . Mario , all suppressors on ! Cliff ! Atan , watch out ! Greetings from the Orion ! Atan , help Mario in tactics ! I 'll go to engineering . Cliff , that won 't be needed . My baby is already asleep . Watch those men ! If you 're equally good as a writer , you 'll go far ! Take him to hibernation ! - Now we 've deserved a whiskey . - YES ! And then homeward ! And all your suffering before you caught on ... Tourenne would have understood a more pronounced hint . We caught on quickly . I still don 't get it . It was quite simple . - If we charge the shuttle ... - ... until it superpulsates ... with energy , and launch it at an 80 degree angle towards the apex of the forcefield , two fields will form which cancel each other out . For an instance , the trap will open , and then ... A marvelous idea ! Unfortunately not his own . No , but it might have been . I 'll use it in my next book , if I may . If you cut me in on the royalty . I 'm afraid more people will want a share . A brilliant idea . The hero in my next novel will blow up the trap just like we did . I thought science fiction was pure fantasy , but this was for real . - Don 't you write about the future ? - Not anymore . Only about you . Fact surpassing fiction . Cheers ! The fate of a space traveler . I think we should contact Space Patrol . We 're seven days overdue . There 's no cause for alarm . You 've said that for seven days . I want a straight answer . What 's happened to the Orion ? I 'm not a clairvoyant . But for what it 's worth , McLane was once 17 days overdue . On the 18th , he happily appeared , asking about my blood pressure . What a joker . Is it true that he takes to the bottle ? Does he drink ? Yes , like a fish . That too . My son-in-law in care of a drunkard . When my daughter finds out ... Don 't worry . Spirits aren 't allowed on board . General ! General , Orion hails us ! Orion 8 under Commander McLane calling from sector 15A-78-18 . We 're on our way back to Earth . Where are you ? We 've been worried sick . We stopped by on Mura . Your orders were to ... I 'm sure you 'll be interested in my report . McLane , how is my son-in-law doing ? He was fine when I last saw him . What do you mean ? I must speak to him at once ! Impossible ! Why is that ? I insist ! He 's lying in his cabin . Is he ill ? Oh no . Drunk as a skunk . Over and out !

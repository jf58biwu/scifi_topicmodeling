 THE SITUATIONS AND CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE ARE PURELY IMAGINARY . ANY SIMILAR NAMES OR RESEMBLANCE TO REAL EVENTS OR PEOPLE THAT EXIST OR HAVE EXISTED WOULD BE PURE COINCIDENCE - How was the blast ? - He 's safe . He 's nearing the crater . What the hell 's he doing ? Jansen ! - Careful ! - OK ! Monday , February 2 : The French-Danish expedition led by Prof. Jansen and Cmd . Lecot discovers in the north of Greenland the body of a man preserved in the ice field . Tuesday , February 3 : the wreck of La Galante , a French steamer lost off Spitzberg in 1905 , is found not far from the body . The man 's shoes dated from the time of the shipwreck . There can be no doubt . The man had been imprisoned in the ice for 65 years . Friday , February 7 : An expedition helicopter carried out the insulated box containing the body in ice . We 'll go live to the Paul Iquen hospital for a press conference by Prof Edouard Loriebat , expert in artificial hibernation . Prof. Loriebat and Prof Barkov , head of psychiatry , take their places before the international press . Ladies and gentlemen ... I can now confirm certain rumors that have leaked out since this afternoon . After 36 hours of gradual thawing , Dr. Barkov and myself have discerned cardiac activity . - Isn 't that incredible ? - It 's crazy ! After several hours , the metabolism regained its normal rate . The subject is physiologically out of hibernation . - Dearest ! - It 's crazy ! In 1905 , the cargo and passenger vessel La Galante was transporting glycerin . When it hit an iceberg , the ice man was probably immersed in glycerin and instantly froze . The glycerin also protected his cellular structures and kept them intact . It 's wonderful , don 't you think ? They find the intact body of a man missing for 65 years and they discover he 's alive . That doesn 't amaze you ? That 's all right . Let 's get back to tonight 's main topic . As longtime president of the French Packaging Company , I 've always had but one goal : to respect , serve and pamper my loyal clientele . I also wanted our Paris factory to be up to the standards of the European Market . The French Packaging Company ... Move ! The French Packaging Company must become a company for the day after tomorrow . I 'm merely following the example of Mr. Crepin-Jaujard , whose establishments are the pride of French packaging . I have not only the honor , but the great pleasure , of announcing at this humble gathering , the upcoming wedding of Evelyne , daughter of Mr. Crepin-Jaujard , and my son Didier . Didier , the son of my dear friends the De Tartas , who could , who knew who understood , who felt ... How can I say ... ? How can I tell you ... ? - It 's hard to say . - Tell me tomorrow . Look at the lovely couple ! A toast to the kids . Be happy . Or at least try to be . Yeah , I know ... Marriage is an institution under attack . Those outside it ... Counselor , that decoration ... - The Legion of Honor ? - Yes . - It came through . - Thank you ! - When will I get it ? - Last week . No , I said , When will I get it ? Last week , I got mine last week . I don 't care , when will I get mine ? I put a word in , it 's imminent . I needed it for tomorrow . - Charles ! - Yes ? - Come here . - Want one ? - What 's this ? - The Legion of Honor . You got it for him , didn 't you ? Thanks for lobbying for my ... I need one for tomorrow . That 's mine ! Hubert , what are you doing ? - Can I call you Hubert ? - Please do . This is fabulous . Really fabulous . Great refurbishing job . We 'll be a big success . You and I will do great things . For the kids ' benefit . I keep thinking about that man who woke up after being frozen for 65 years , it 's incredible . - It 's terrible . - Why ? - An old 25-year-old . - You 're right ! Suppose he had descendants . His grandchildren must be old geezers our age ! What a drag ! Especially for the one who gets dragged into it ! - Sir ! - Yes ? - The police are here ! - What ? The police . - Where ? - There . - Mr. ? - Mr. De Tartas ? - Yes . - Urgent message for you . I already know . Thank you ! Look ! General Secretary , Minister of the Interior ! Mr. De Tartas ! The General Secretary will see you . - General Secretary . - Mr. De Tartas . - What an honor ! - Please come in . Please sit down . This summons must have come as a surprise to you . I didn 't expect the honor . I 'm sure you 've heard about the ice man . I 'm sorry , what ... ? Have you heard about the ice man ? Everyone has . The ice man has been identified . Good . I don 't see what that has to do with me . You know the ice man 's family . It 's a family that 's close to you . Very close . Very intriguing . Which family ? Yours . Mine ? Yes . My name is Hubert Barert de Tartas . I know the names of all my ancestors for centuries back . Some fell on the battlefield in barbarous lands , others died natural deaths in their chateaux . I guarantee no De Tartas froze at the North Pole . The ice man isn 't a De Tartas . His name is Paul Fournier . Fournier ! Doesn 't ring a bell ? There must be some in the phone book . Didn 't you marry a Fournier ? You can 't seriously claim he 's related to my wife ! Her grandfather . - Wha ... ? - He 's her grandfather . I love a good joke , but some humor crosses the line . In my circles , we rarely indulge in humor . What a stroke of luck for our country ! If the ice man survives , France will get credit for the greatest discovery of all time . Survival ! What do you think ? Prof. Loriebat , who has our utmost confidence , is expecting you and your wife at the hospital . - You , here ? - I need this check signed . - Edmee , goddammit ! - No need to yell . - Rabier ! - Signature ... Sign here . I was telling your husband you should sign the checks , since it 's your factory . Good - bye ! Where 's your grandfather ? Where 's your grandfather ? - Which one ? - Grandpa Fournier ! What a strange question ! He 's been dead for ages , Hubert . - Dead and buried . - Where ? Dampierre , I think . Make sure . What 's with you ? I was very young when mother died . I 'm sure I went to the cemetery . I must clear this up . - Can I know ... ? - I need to know ! - Where ? - I can 't remember ! - Remember ! - That way . Come on . - No , it was on a path . - There are paths everywhere . You search that way and I 'll search this way . Found it ! Wait ! Here 's Grandmother Fournier . He 's not here ! She 's all by herself ! She 's alone . Grandfather 's somewhere else . - I knew it ! - Knew what ? Do you want to know where he is ? He 's been in an ice cube for the last 65 years ! Sound at all familiar ? - The ice man ? - Yes . Granny ! Grandfather 's back ! - Hurry up ! - Be right there . Sophie will take care of dinner . Well ? I 'm so excited about meeting Grandfather ! Edmee ! - Where 's your mother ? - In the garage . - Here 's Grandpa . - That 's him ? Cool ! Cute ! - Keep an eye on the kid . - With pleasure . What does he want ? - Yes ? - I hear Paul 's back . - Who 's Paul ? - Paul Fournier . Don 't start that ! I have no idea . - He 's my oldest friend . - I won 't tell you anything . Is he back ? You 're in my way . - I 'm not holding the car . - Yes , you are . - Put it in first . - Then what ? Second ? I 'm not holding you . Let me go , please ! But I 'm his oldest friend . We 're now entering a sterile environment . The slightest upset could compromise his mental well-being or his life . He 's still very sick . He thinks it 's still 1905 . One last thing : You 'll find he 's changed . Appearances don 't matter , my heart will know him . It 's horrible ! That monster 's not my ancestor ! - I 'm scared ! Take me home ! - We 're here for that ? That 's Prehistoric Man ! This is him . Calm down . We were waiting for you before we shaved him . Then shave him ! Here are the implements . Dr. Bibolini , one of our eminent psychiatrists . He 's monitoring the mental state and gradual rehabilitation of your relative . Who knows if he 's my ancestor ? But if he is and you 've left him in that state , all I can ask is , Why ? I didn 't think he was ready to confront himself . Today he asked for a mirror . The time is ripe . Any objections , esteemed colleague ? I handle the physical aspect , esteemed colleague . Scissors . Does he remember what happened to him ? Snatches of his family life before his marriage . - He forgot Grandmother ? - Seems so . We told him he fell off a horse . It 's him ! It 's Grandfather ! You brought him back ! Thank you ! What will you do with him ? We 're taking him home . I 'm afraid that 's impossible . He belongs to science . Yes ! I 'm afraid he belongs to his family . He 's not a guinea pig . These gentlemen are right . God knows if ... He belongs to science , unfortunately . We can 't predict how he 'll react . His mental progress concerns all humanity . And physiological . - I don 't care . - Think about it . He thinks it 's 1905 . He wouldn 't at our house . Surrounded by his loving family , he 'll come to realize . I object ! Any mistake could cause irreversible damage . They 're the experts . Defer to them , I did . You 'll see him soon . It 's not our decision , it 's the government 's . I don 't care about the government ! Smile , pretty ! How do your parents feel about the ice man ? Father hates publicity . Don 't move . Mother 's ashamed , but he 's just an object of curiosity . It 's incredible , my great-grandfather 's my age . Poor man , it 's sad . No , it 's the future . You go in the fridge at 20 and come out 50 years later , still 20 . Evelyne , I didn 't see you . - You 're only young once . - Are you sure ? Your son 's taking his time with Evelyne . With the Crepins ' capital , I won 't be at your whim . Didier 's too young to wed . In the meantime , my darling , I have an important bill to pay . Put your pretty signature here . I want Grandfather . You 've managed to do without him up till now . Family 's important to me . I 'll get him here . Sign here . - When he gets here . - Goddammit ! Don 't swear . Let 's go to bed , my pet , it 'll work out . I don 't think so . You 're in the guest room . - Goddammit ! - Good night . Yes , counselor , what is it ? Sorry to call so late , I was in court . About your ice man ... I went over the case . It 's a problem . I know , so ? It 's quite simple , really , the matter of his absence . The law ? The law is unequivocal . Paul Fournier , the ice man , is alive , right ? - It 's his property . - What ? - Everything belongs to him . - I 'll stop him . - Not without his consent . - Impossible ! - Sorry , it 's indisputable . - Nothing I can do ? Sorry , I have 2 urgent cases to look over . - Edmee , open the door ! - I 'm sleeping . You 're right , it 's kidnapping . - I 'm sleeping ! - I 'll get your grandfather . He seems so nice . I can 't live without him . Edmee , open ! Sweetheart ! I 'm sleeping ! Professor , I command you to give me my wife 's grandfather . - Sorry ? - I can 't do that . The press are outside . I 'll cause a stink ! - I 'll sue the government ! - For what ? For what ? Arbitrary confinement . The ice man thinks it 's 1905 . You haven 't been born . You don 't exist and you might never exist . - Sir . - Yes ? - A man to see you . - Why didn 't you say ? - I 'm saying . - When ? - Now . - Liar ! - Hello , doctor . - I 'm glad you 're here . We must prevent Loriebat from committing a fatal mistake . - I don 't understand . - Please sit down . Fatal how ? I 'm convinced Loriebat 's terribly misguided . - No doubt . - Wait . Fournier must be placed immediately in a family context . - That 's what I said . - Let me continue ! Prof. Loriebat obtained official permission today to transfer the subject to a rest home . With strangers , whereas we have the finest ... Listen . The transfer will take place tomorrow under escort . But I can 't act alone , and I trust no one but you . Give me your orders . We 're 7 minutes early . He won 't even notice he 's been moved . He asked to go home again . - Patients will talk . - You leave him no choice . Professor . My hands are clammy . I feel faint . Don 't complicate things ! I should 've taken ... Not on the stretcher ! Feeling better ? Better ? That 's enough ! It 's almost time . Go have a drink with my assistant . Come on , I 'm thirsty . I feel like a big , cold beer , don 't you ? Good ! Get off me ! Guess who ? Stop it ! No more oxygen for you . Take the stretcher . Doctor ! All by yourself ? Take his feet ! Stop it ! That 's enough ! Go away ! - How 'd it go ? How is he ? - Fine . That was close . How far 's your hunting camp ? - 20 minutes , we 're fine . - He thinks it 's 1900 ? - What ? - He thinks it 's 1900 ? Yes , it 's fine . - He 's waking up ! - See ? You told me he 'd be out for half an hour . He 's not precise like a watch , we 've failed . No , we haven 't failed . Moron ! Look at them ! Where am I ? - What happened ? - You fell off a horse . A horse ? Why was I on a horse ? Be patient , your memory will come back . It 's 1905 , Sarah Bernhardt triumphed in " L 'Aiglon " and Mr. Loubet is still president . No , they wouldn 't have dared ! Let me up , I 'm Prof. Loriebat ! Sure , sure . I swear ! Sir , hurry ! - Be a good boy . - Let me up ! He seems agitated . - Where 's Prof. Loriebat ? - He 's here ! Let me go ! - I don 't understand ... - Well , I do ! Where 's the phone ? Where 's the phone ? Given the period , we thought a phone ... Enough ! Call in the gendarmes , national security and the defense department . What 's going on ? What do you mean ? They stole the ice man from me . - You took a wrong turn . - You said to turn right . - Oh no ! - See ? Come on ! Hold this . He 's gone ! - No , there he is . - Where ? Ambulance spotted . Suspicious behavior . Avoiding the roadblock . Do not take action ? OK . - They saw us , we 're lost ! - No , we aren 't , where are we ? - I don 't know . - He 's waking up ! Protect him at all costs ! Doctor , look ! Don 't even think about it . Hold him . Give him this . Churches always look the same . - He won 't be disoriented . - True . Don 't like it ? - Got anything else ? - No . Hubert , look over there ! Troops fall out ! You won 't let me in ? - Halt ! - Give me that . Dr. Bibolini and Mr. De Tartas ! You have 15 minutes . The crime you 've committed deserves punishment . Be reasonable and I 'll see it 's light . I 'm waiting . - He 's asleep , let 's go . - We 're surrounded . - Is there a tunnel ... ? - Better to give him up . No , he belongs with his family , right ? Now he belongs to God . You 're keeping him ? By keeping him alive and bringing you all here , the Lord made His wishes clear . This man 's fate is in His hands . May prayer bring us light . Goddammit ! He 's snubbing us . We 've secured the perimeter , that 's all we can do . I 'll go in alone . Help me ! It 's too late . - This is your fault ! - What 's the use ? You too , help me . - Watch it ! - What is it ? - Someone walking . - Who is it ? Against the wall ! - Is it him ? - No . - Is it him ? - No , it 's not . I think I 'm cracking up . No ! I 'm cracking up . Sorry to disturb your meditations , brothers ... I know you 've taken a vow of silence ... I 'm cracking up ! I cracked up . Mother ! Darling ! I want to go home . To our house , right away . I 'll defer to him . His cure 's what 's important . A family context but during the Belle Epoque . You want to set him up in my mansion ? - Sorry ? - I said of course . He saw it in 1900 , will he recognize it ? I can 't hear you . You 'll put it back to how it was in the early century . I spent a fortune modernizing it ! The paint 's barely dry . If he can 't come to our time , his time has to come to him . I just got an idea . Why don 't we just tell him what year it is ? - It 'd save money . - It 'd kill him . - Not that ! - I didn 't say anything . You wagged your big head ! I don 't have a big head and I didn 't wag . You have a big head and you wagged . OK , my head 's big , but I didn 't wag . Yes . - Wagged how ? - Like this . Now I 'm wagging , fine , but I wasn 't before . Stop it ! Grandfather 's coming to live with us . We have orders from high up not to ruin the experiment . I won 't go along ! Mr. De Tartas , what makes a country great ? I don 't care . You have no right ! What makes a country great is space . I don 't care . I won 't allow this ! What makes a country great is space , which requires hibernation . We 'll go much farther than just Mars or Venus . The voyages will last a century or two , maybe millennia . One lifetime 's too short . We 'll need to hibernate , that 's where we come in . - If I say no ? - What about France ? - I won 't allow this ! - What did I say ? You said , " I don 't care . " The state will pay all expenses . The mansion 's original period decor was restored . Identical ? The furniture has changed slightly during his absence . What if he wants to go out ? He 's convalescing , he won 't be allowed off the grounds . Cars ? Le Vesinet is closed to modern traffic . Antique cars have been given out . Aside from residents , only people with passes will be allowed in , and because of their dress , coalmen , clergymen and nuns . Two - penny letters will be delivered on bicycle , and stands will sell period newspapers . - When can we see him ? - Soon . We gave him a shot for the trip , and we don 't know how he 'll react when he wakes up . It 'll go fine . My wife looks just like her grandmother , but I don 't look like his father . - I don 't agree . - There 's nothing to comb . You 're awake . - Why all these changes ? - I 'll call madam . I 'm not complaining . You 're much better than old Irma . So are you . - I mean ... - What 's your name ? Sophie . I feel we 'll become fast friends . You 're sick . I 've never felt better in my life . You 're crazy . Maybe , but does it really matter ? Let me go ! I have orders ! I give the orders now . I would never harm such a pretty face . Bring me oatcakes , cocoa and the paper , I 'm starving ! Yes , sir . Madam ! What a figure ! He 's awake ! Completely awake ? I can guarantee it . My God ! Excuse me , Rabier . Mrs. De Tartas ? Professor , he 's awake ! - Has he seen his father ? - Not yet . I 'll get him ready . He 's awake ! Get dressed . It 's all about him . He even took my room . You 're next to mine . - Did he talk to you ? - With his hands . - Bastard ! At his age ! - He 's well-preserved . - How 's my big boy ? - You 're lovely today , Mother . Doesn 't he look well , professor ? Come on , you 'll be fine . Unbelievable , you 're a perfect match . - Congratulations . - Thanks . - Did he mention his father ? - Not once . - Is that bad ? - He never mentioned him ? Don 't worry , it 'll go fine . This is bad , we 'll have to shock him . - Why a shock ? - Calm down . Don 't worry . Try the shock . Come on , go inside . Paul , my son . Have you forgotten your father ? Come into my arms . Get out ! Out ! Odious person ! Blackguard ! - Seducer ! Leave this instant ! - He 's your father ! Paul , don 't go out ! - The shock was too extreme . - You and your ideas ! - He 'd better not come back . - Calm down ! Let me go . Let him in ! - My good sir , you must save me . - Who are you ? Don 't recognize me ? Look ! You wretch ! - You dared ! - Stop it ! You dared to come back ! Stop ! You abandoned your family for a cheap actress . - It wasn 't me ! - Get up ! Look ! I 'd have to be 111 ! You 're right , it 's impossible . Sorry . Coming back here after what he did to you ! I 'll take care of you from now on . We 'll forget about it over dinner at Maxim 's . Not at all ! I 've seen enough of you . Please send me a bill for your fees and withdraw . Promise you won 't go out . I 'll make sure . He 's making progress , despite the father incident . - Some idea ! - Where are you going ? - Home . - Are you not thinking ? The experiment failed , you 're not needed here . - Then where , a hotel ? - Good idea . - It 's the only way . - I 'm going home ! If we 're to remain friends ... - It 's the patient that counts . - I don 't care ! Take him away . - He 's my husband ! - He went too far . You 're divorced . - Forget that cad . - But he 's your father . Don 't mention him again . That 's practical ... Mom , the cops took Dad ! You 're confused , young man , you think you 're home ? Sorry , what was I thinking ? A student who rents an attic room here . He goes to military college . Very good , young man . I find your behavior cavalier . He 's so cute . Sophie , you may leave . But Paul 's cuter . Sophie ! - She has taste . - I don 't agree . I 've heard about you , but I 'm not impressed . Didier ! Young man , I never ! - I 'll throw him out tomorrow . - Please don 't do that ! I understand your loneliness . You 're young and beautiful ... Yes ! Prey to all kinds of lust . Surrounded by temptation . Some can be dangerous . - Do my words anger you ? - No , Grandfather . - You 're mocking me . - No ... Mother , it 'd be best if you remarried . Funny you should say that , I was thinking about it . Anyone in mind ? I didn 't want to say , but yes . Really ? Do I know him ? Introduce me . I want to make sure he 's worthy of you . What is your name , sir ? Whom shall I announce ? Don 't you recognize me ? I 've never met ... Sorry , Mr. De Tartas . Where 's my wife ? - In the winter garden . - Announce me . Courting your wife must make you feel young . - Idiot ! Announce me . - Announce who ? Guess . Mr. De Tartos . - De Tartos ? - De Tartas , idiot ! De Tartas idiot . Same name , more ... - Move it ! - Yes , sir . - Come here . - What is it ? How do I look ? Never mind , move it . Sophie , come here ! Leave that alone . I 'll show him in . You can go in . Mr. De Tartas ? My respects , dear lady . Welcome . My dear man ... I told Paul of my high regard for you and he was looking forward to meeting you . You 're too kind . I brought this humble testament to my devotion . See how he spoils me ? You shouldn 't have ! They 're magnificent ! Are they heavy ? Not at all . She won 't be long . - I 'll be fine . - Put these on the table . - Love is grand . - Without commentary . Yes , love is a noble sentiment , as long as it 's deep and heartfelt . My mother deserves to be happy , I 'll make sure she is . - Now , Paul . - He understands . Very well . Come into my office . Excuse me , Mother . - Certainly , darling . - Sorry ? - I thought ... - Very well . This way . - This way ? - No . Forgive Paul , he can be abrupt but he adores me . That door . Please sit down . A drop of madeira ? No , thanks . - An old grenache ? - No , thanks . - Diet ? - No . Any health problems ? Weak liver ? No , I 'm fine . Good . Cigar ? No , I quit smoking . You have every virtue . I won 't beat around the bush . My mother said you were a widower . - Yes . - How did your wife die ? How did your wife die ? Yes , I understood . It was horrible , horrible ! She wasn 't well in the morning , like this , when suddenly she went ... She couldn 't talk . She started swelling up , then exploded . It was dreadful ! What are you raving about ? Dreadful ! She exploded , bits of her everywhere , it was horrible . But she didn 't suffer . I prefer clear-cut situations . - As do I. - You intend to marry my mother ? Yes . I wouldn 't want you to hasten things . Move in here . - Very kind of you . - You helped the factory . But I 'll take over now . You can 't mean that ! It 's impossible ! What 'll happen to you ? You 're going back to work ? At least my rotten father left me the factory . I 'm young , I can run it . The doctors recommend you don 't tire yourself out . You 'll get tired . You 're fine now , but ... That 's absurd ! Don 't forget the financial worries , checks to sign ... - I 'll sign them . - You can 't sign them . You think I can 't ? Don 't say that . Give me a large Grenache and I 'll smoke a big cigar . Coming through ! This sudden leap into the past is rather exciting . It 's a burden . So many troops deployed for a commoner . If he 's common , why bother ? For you , don 't you want to see Didier ? Nothing to do with snobbery or curiosity , of course . He 's watching . Still watching . He 's gone ! He thinks he 's inherited an oil-lamp factory . Keep him away or it 'll be a disaster . It 's his , what can I say ? It 's time you told him the truth . I 'll tell him . No , he 's back ! Don 't test my patience . Without my family , you 're nothing . I won 't need it for much longer . Didier will marry Evelyne , and you can play with your oil lamps . Hubert ! - Hubert ! - Oil ! I 'm scared of heights ! - I 'm scared of heights ! - I don 't care ! Friends ! - Are you hurt ? - Not at all . - Everything all right ? - We were expecting you . Come this way , please . - Keep going . - Lovely ! - You think so ? - Yes . I thought we were fighting . Go change your dress . Lovely couple . Learn from them . 20 years of marriage ... If their son 's like them , Evelyne 's a lucky girl . Where 's Didier ? No ! What are you doing in Didier 's room ? - I trusted you . - It 's not a crime . It 's an offense against me . I 'll dock your wages . The boss might not agree . - I 'm the boss . - No , Paul is . You brat ! Wanna bankrupt your father ? The Crepin-Jaujards are downstairs with Evelyne . Listen closely : I 've had it up to here with those people . Up to where ? Up to here . And you can stick your sham marriage ... I 'll never do that . Your jacket ! Your jacket ! The Crepin-Jaujards . I 'm so anxious to meet him , I 'm afraid I 'll slip up . - Would that be bad ? - Terrible . - Charles ! - Terrible . Go now ! It would be dramatic ! His reason could give out . Please pay attention . - Keep an eye on me . - I always have . Where 's your grandfather ? Be patient , he 's coming . I didn 't picture you like this . - When I think of your age . - I 'm too young ? No , you 're just fine . Here 's Didier . You look wonderful , Didier . - My respects . - He looks annoyed . - Anything wrong ? - No , nothing . - Anything wrong ? - No , nothing . Where 's Evelyne ? In the grounds , looking for Didier . - I 'll get her . - Yes . No , I 'll go . What 's wrong ? - Did you see my daughter ? - Charles ! - Did you see Evelyne ? - Charles ! You didn 't see her ? - Charles ! - Yes ? Get me a large Grenache in a large glass and a small cigar . You 're overreacting ! Paul was just being gallant . Crepin-Jaujard and I agreed on the marriage . - Everything 's fine . - No , it 's not . I won 't let your grandfather steal my son 's fiancee . What are you doing ? What ? What are you doing ? Why ? We 're not married yet . People will talk . Come on . The excitement 's worn you out . You don 't love me anymore . - Yes , I do . - No . My darling , I 'm lonely , so lonely . Then here . - What 's that gonna ... ? - Wait ! Take this . It 'll keep you company . Keep it quiet . My respects , and may the night be gentle . - Did Paul see ? - No . He 'd kill you if he saw you . He thought I was wishing you good night . Thanks for thinking of it . All this scheming reminds me of when we were courting . Your grandfather 's youth is giving us back our own . - It 's late . - No . Very late . Never too late to court your wife , sweetheart . - Enough ... - Sweetheart ! - That won 't get you anywhere . - Sweetheart ! Mom ! Mom ! - What is it ? - It 's me . Can I come in ? Wait ! - Hubert ! - Who is it ? Wake up ! For the love of God ! What 's going on ? Come in ! - Tell me if you like this poem . - Don 't you sleep ? No ... Listen . " To Evelyne : " Our love was born the moment we first met . " An image came to haunt my wan morning . " The image was of you , my love , a nude . " Keep going . " Come back , my sweet , without you I am pale . " If you want me , tomorrow you 'll be mine . " Before God in His temple , with a Yes , " My life and heart I 'll lay on the altar . " You don 't like it ? Yes ! It 's lovely ... It 's lovely . You 're getting all worked up . She might not be free . I think she has someone . A very nice boy . - I 'll kill him . - Don 't you dare ! I 'm too happy to be mean to you . I 'll send the letter with Charles . What do you think of that ? He did insist . It 's 5 a.m. ! I 'll nip this affair in the bud . It 's horrible ! What 's taking him ? This is new . - I need you . - At this hour ? - Be nice to the staff . - Smile ! Life is beautiful ! He doesn 't miss a trick . Now he doesn 't sleep . Of course , he did everything beforehand . - Where are you going ? - To stop that love letter . I 'll nip this affair in the bud . You get a raise . You too , Charles . You 're fantastic . That 's new , haven 't heard that . They didn 't say that in your time ? - My time ? - Just before your accident . You 're convalescing ! Very well , thanks . - Sophie ! - Poor Sophie ! - What is that bizarre getup ? - Pajamas . I have catching up to do . You have no idea . - Take this letter into town . - Now ? - It 's urgent . - Right now ? Yes , and smile ! - A lady ? - Yes . - Already ? - The most beautiful . Without leaving the house ? Bravo ! Give me that . - It 's not for you . - Is Didier there ? Yes . Go away or I 'll hit you ! " If you want me , tomorrow you 'll be mine . " Before God in His temple , with a Yes , " My life and heart I 'll lay on the altar . " You wrote that ? It 's hard to believe . I knew you 'd make fun . Dad insisted I read it .

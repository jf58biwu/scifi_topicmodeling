 * * Hey , you can 't park there ! The Washington flight , has it gone yet ? No , it 's due right now . But you 'll have to move your car . Oh , thank God . It 's them ! They 've taken over the lodge . They look , act and talk like real people but they 're not . They 're going to kill me ! I swear they 're ... Now , wait a minute ... Been like that for a couple of days now- - tough . Everything 's going to be all right , Mr. Grayson . There 's going to be a plane landing ... in a moment . He 's all right now . He sure had me scared there for a minute . You 'll have to excuse me . Hey ! ( clattering ) NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest star in tonight 's story : Shirley Knight . And special guest star Kevin McCarthy . NARRATOR : The manager of a famed resort hotel has been driven to suicide by the delusion that alien beings had taken over his hotel . Convinced that the man 's story was no delusion , David Vincent promptly traveled to the small Virginia airport . He just walked right out there into the path of a landing plane . Never looked back . We better get back to the office . DANVERS : Mr. Bowman ... I , uh , thought I asked you to clear the area . We were just leaving , Mr. Danvers . Who 's that ? The new manager of the lodge . Insists that everybody clear out while this private plane comes in . The owner insists upon complete privacy . Well , who 's on the plane ? Can 't tell you that . Oh , Danver 's orders , huh ? Yeah . Well , I 'm sorry I couldn 't help you , Vincent . Right into the prop . I 'll have nightmares for a year . Say , uh ... you really could help me if you 'd tell me who 's on that plane . This guy who killed himself , was he a friend of yours ? We were working on the same project . Here , uh , hold this a second for me . I have to get something . Under the manifest . Thank you . For what ? I didn 't tell you anything . How about not telling me where I can get a job , too ? Out of work , too , huh ? Well , try the bus company . If it helps , use my name . * * Welcome to Pine Lake Lodge , Mr. Cook . You 're Danvers ? Yes . You followed my instructions ? Yes , I did . All the guests have vacated the lodge . All right . See to the luggage for my niece and myself . * * * * Ramsey . Simms ? Yes , sir ? What have you done with my briefcase ? Right here , Mr. Cook . I 'll see the breakdown on radar , SAC bases , missile sites . Have you finished unpacking my things ? No , not yet , sir . All right , get on with it . Cookie ? Ramsey ? Simms ? Bell hop ? Chambermaid ? Anybody ? Right here , Maggie . You know what I 'm going to do when you die , Cookie ? That I would like to know . I 'm going to check into a hotel with some people in it . ( chuckles ) You know how I am about people . That 's your hang up . It 's going to be a small , gossipy hotel in some place like , uh , say New York . And I 'm going to sit in the lobby and talk to anybody who 'll talk to me . You used to like this place . ( phone ringing ) Ramsey ? ! Yes , sir . Yes ? Yes , it is . Well , who is it ? Uh , yes , just a moment , please . Washington , Mr. Cook . Who in Washington ? The President , the Secretary ? The Secretary . He wants to know if you won 't change your mind about security . Tell him I expect them this afternoon as planned . And I don 't want to stumble over anybody wearing a shoulder holster or a trench coat . Yes , sir . You 're tense , Cookie . I don 't like it . It 'll pass . What kind of deal is it this time ? Why should you need protection ? I 'm involved in something larger than usual . The fate of all mankind ? You never share anything with me anymore . Do you know that ? Why don 't you trade me in for a poodle ? Don 't start a war , Maggie . I 'm sorry . Be the beautiful girl you always have been . Oh , that 's ... that 's groovy . Where are you going ? Down to the pool . Maybe there 's a sexy lifeguard . Get off the phone , Ramsey . We 'll do our talking when they get here . I 'm sorry , Mr. Secretary , I have to hang up now . Yes , thank you , sir . Stop looking at me . Well , I 'm not looking at you , sir . Well , I mean , I-I wasn 't . Well , somebody is . How could they , sir ? When you 're in the business I 'm in you develop a sixth sense about a thing like that . Simms ! I want you to check this room out . Go all over it . I feel like a bug under a microscope . ALIEN : I want you to check out this room . Go all over it . I feel like a bug under a microscope . Interesting voice pattern . But I think I 'm getting it now . Miss Cook ! Maybe you 'd better take my hand . Why ? A few more inches , you 'll be in that pool . Oh , well , if you 're interested I can swim like a dolphin . I also hike and climb and I ski . I even pitch a mean game of horseshoes . Sounds like a good life . Well , it 's a long way from fun , mister , but it 's not the end of the world , either . Who are you ? David Vincent . That 's just a name . Well , right now I drive the mountain bus . I 'm also a crusader . I 'm out to save the world . ( chuckles ) A lot of people think I 'm a nut . Why ? Well , what would you say if I told you I go around the country chasing flying saucers ? Well , I 'd say you were fun . Uh , how did you know my name ? Well , the papers are carrying a story about you and your uncle . I suppose you want to meet him . Well , as a matter of fact , I 'd like to . Well , at least you 're honest about it . Most people think they can get to Paul Cook by cultivating his niece . Politicians , reporters , con men , opportunists , what have you . What class do you fall in ? None of those . Oh , you really are out to save the world ? Well , I 'm sorry . That 's not my line . Wait just a minute . I 'm not trying ... No , let 's just cool it right here . Your approach was different . That 's about all , Mr. Vincent . Well , Maggie ... did you have an interesting morning ? I met a young man . A muscle-bound lifeguard , no doubt . Not at all . He said he was in the crusading business . Maggie , it worries me when you go out alone like that . Next time I want you to take Simms . Oh , right . He can carry my dollies and my teddy bear . Maggie ! What , Cookie ? I 'm not a little girl with pigtails anymore . I 'm 25 years old . I have a great right arm . You want me to go get her ? ( latch clicks ) ( creaking ) What 's that ? Someone 's here . Who is it ? ! If somebody 's here and they 're not saying anything , they 're a fink . Go get her . If it 's necessary , you may apologize for me . ( knock at door ) Who is it ? Friend , foe , or Cookie 's errand boy ? Who is it ? You , make a move and I 'll kill you . Well , Mr. Vincent , you certainly have a way of getting what you go after , haven 't you ? You know him ? MARGARET : He 's the self-admitted nut I met downstairs at the pool . Says he drives the mountain bus and that he has to see you . All right , let 's hear it- - Why ? I came to stop you . Stop me ? From doing what ? Making your deal . Deal ? What kind of a deal ? I 'm not playing games with you . Everyone knows what Paul Cook is to the missile defense system . What they don 't know is what would happen if you sell out . Sell out ? You 're not making sense . You think you can do business with them , you can 't . Nobody can . When they get what they want , they 'll turn on you . They 're here to take over the world . Give them America 's defense secrets and they can do it . Ramsey ... Call the desk , tell them Simms is bringing down Mr. Vincent . I want him locked up and guarded . On your feet . Cookie ... Not now , Maggie ! What did they promise you , Cook ? A kingdom ? Move out . Cookie ... . I know what you 're going to say , Maggie . This is not the wounded robin bit . This is a man ! And you think I 'm being cruel . Well , as it happens , I 'm a pretty good judge of character . So am I. And Mr. Vincent is a crackpot . I don 't suppose you 'd , uh , listen to me for a minute . No , not for a second . Keep walking . I want to hear more about this meeting you 're having . He really got to you , this bus driver of yours , didn 't he ? Now , no more sparring , Cookie . This is for real . What 's all the secrecy about ? I can 't tell you , Maggie . Well , then we 've really lost something , haven 't we ? Maybe so . I 'm helping the government overhaul the country 's defense installations . They 're bringing me all their logistical problems this afternoon . Where we 're strong , where we need building up , I 'm going to try to upgrade the system . That 's all . I have an important uncle . Why didn 't we go right to Washington ? It 's just a mashie shot down the road . My hang up . If the government can stand it , Maggie can . Let 's go finish our lunch . We never made it to the lobby , uh ... Go on without me , Maggie . Oh , don 't be cruel , Cookie . He couldn 't help it , he ... Go on ! Yes , sir , it 's a matter of national security . Look , can I speak to the special agent in charge ? V-I-N-C ... Thank you . Never mind . Let me help you inside . Slow down , now . You can sit right here . Thank you . How do you take your coffee ? Black . When you 're not being crazy you 're rather nice . All right , Maggie , why did you come ? Friend , foe , or Cookie 's errand boy ? That was a dirty trick back there . It 's a dirty business . What a couple of winners we are . You blind to everything that 's going on and me just blind . Be careful . It 's hot . Thank you . You , you don 't mind the blind leading the blind for a moment , do you ? No . Go ahead . You couldn 't be more wrong about Cookie . He isn 't selling anything to anyone . He 's true . Red , white and blue . I read the papers on his desk . And misunderstood them completely . How ? You 'll just have to take my word for that . There 's too much at stake for that . Then will you take my word for this ? Please don 't go to the hotel . I love my uncle and all that , but he can be one nasty Cookie . And you 're an easy target . Don 't tempt him . You 're going to have to take my word about something . Those people at the lodge . I know what they can do . And it 's not pretty , even by Cookie 's standards . Let me tell you what I know . Maggie ? ! Did you see her ? She 's not in the dining room . All right , you check around the pool . I 'll check over this way . Meet you back here . Yes , sir ? I 'm looking for Miss Cook . Nobody 's been this way , sir . What 's that over there ? The power station . I wouldn 't go up there , sir . Why not ? The high voltage could be dangerous . She could be in trouble ! * * ( phone rings ) Paul Cook speaking . That 's right . Plane 's due in at three . I 'd like you to send the limousine for them . And you believe all of this ? Maggie , I know . I 've seen it . Well , then maybe you do know something that I don 't , but ... Cookie wouldn 't help them . And he doesn 't have the up-to-date information anyway . At least ... not until this afternoon . ( phone rings ) Hello . Vincent ? This is Ramsey . Is Margaret with you ? Yeah , she 's here , Ramsey . What do you want ? The power station ? Yeah , of course we 'll come up . You and Simms better get to Cook right away . He 's driving her back . Do you still think he 's a crackpot ? Well , if he is , I am , too . Let 's find Cook . Ramsey 's all right . If he says he saw something bad , it 's bad . We 're almost there . I worry about my uncle . For three years we 've been nowhere , locked up in this big house in Switzerland . I had to talk him into coming here to get back in the action again . What happened three years ago ? Cookie was driving . He came out of it with scars and guilt . I got this . David ? ! What is it ? What 's happened ? Ramsey and Simms didn 't have any families . That ought to make me feel better . Just try not to think of it . I 'll take you to your uncle . You can 't go alone . No , it 's all right . You , you just go to the power station . All right , but be careful . I 'll be back as soon as I check out what Ramsey was talking about . Danvers , she 's been gone for nearly two hours ! And an hour ago my secretary and pilot went out to look for her and they haven 't come back . Then I suggest that you organize your staff and find them ! Maggie , what is this ? If you 're going to drop out of sight for two hours I 'd appreciate it if you 'd leave word . Drop me a note . What 's the matter ? Ramsey and Simms ... They 're dead . What are you talking about ? Is this some kind of a joke ? It 's no joke , Cookie . How did it happen ? Halfway down the mountain . The road ended , the car went on . I don 't believe it . Simms is too good a driver . They were murdered . You 're probably next . David Vincent was- - Oh , if you 've been talking to that idiotic bus driver . Will you listen to me for once ? They have taken over the lodge ! They 're all around us . S-Somehow they 've , they 've spared us so far because we , we fit into their plans . They , they , they ! Explain . The people that are running this lodge . They 're ... they 're not people . And they , they mean to take us over one way or another . And you are one of the ways . All right , Maggie . You asked me to get us out of Switzerland . To bring you here and I did . Now if you want to leave here , we 'll do that , too . Whatever you say . Thank you . I would like to go r-right away . All right . But there are two important generals coming a long way this afternoon just to get my views . Now , if I run out , they 'll think that I 've cracked up and maybe I have . I just want you to be sure . I am sure . All right . You go pack and I 'll call Washington and cancel the meeting . I want to call Washington . What ? All circuits are out ? ! It 's time . * * ( grunts ) ( both grunting ) ( electrical buzzing ) ( rotary dialing ) Cookie ? Over here , Maggie . I ... thought I heard something . Sit down . Well , what 's wrong ? I talked to Washington . They insist the meeting take place as scheduled . They promised full security . Well , you , you said we could go ! I 'm doing this for you , Maggie . Without Simms and Ramsey , we 're safer where we are . I thought I 'd reached you . I thought you understood . I do understand , Maggie . But there are funeral arrangements to be made and , uh , I 'm worried about you , Maggie . You look tired . Just a little disappointed . In me ? Yes . I promise you we 'll leave here as soon as the meeting is over . We 'll even have a military escort out of here . All right . Why don 't you go to your room , lock both doors and lie down ? It won 't be much longer . I 'm back in kindergarten , aren 't I , uncle ? Don 't forget my milk and cookies . Just let me know when you hear from David . I promise , Maggie . ( phone ringing ) David ? Maggie , I 'm trying to reach your uncle . His phone is busy . He 's been talking to Washington . I tried to get him to leave but he , he won 't , not until after this meeting . Of course , he 's all right . I just left him . Well , get back to him . Tell him they 're going to kill him and put one of their own in his place . He has to get out of there . I 'll meet him at , uh ... I 'll meet him at the pool in five minutes . The car 's waiting , Mr. Cook . Come with me . What is it now , Maggie ? Cookie , you 've got to get out of here right away . David has just found out they 're going to kill you . They 're going to put a man in your place . He says he 'll meet you at the pool . And why do these inhuman beings want to put a man in my place ? There must be a reason . I 'm going to punch you right in the nose . They want Washington 's defense plans ! Of course . And your friend , David , must have a theory about how they 're going to get them , too ? Only three people have seen you since the accident . Two are dead and one is a bit nearsighted . Now , I know this will shake your vanity a bit , but you 'd be easier to impersonate than W.C. Fields . Now , just calm down ! Calm down . That 'll be enough now . All right . I 'll see your Vincent . I 'll be armed and careful . I want you to go back into your room , and lock your door . And stop worrying . I don 't understand you . You 're too fast on your feet for me these days , Cookie . First you say we 'll go and then we stay . You treat me like one of the boys and then you stick my pigtails in an inkwell . I think you 're a schizophrenic . Two completely different people . I only like one of you . This Vincent . He 'll be at the pool . ( tires squeal ) Vincent 's not at the pool . Are you sure ? I 'm sure there 's some logical explanation for this . If I 'd listened to you the way you listen to him ... Go back and wait for him . Cookie , please . I know he 'll be there . No , no , there 's no time . The generals will be here any minute now and besides , I want to notify the families of Simms and Ramsey before the conference starts . Their families ? ( tires screeching ) Welcome to Pine Lake Lodge . Will you take us to Paul Cook , please . This way to the conference room , gentlemen . Thank you . ( statue shatters ) * * * * Can I help you , Miss Cook ? Uh , no . You 're walking without your cane . Well , some people do walk without canes , Mr. Danvers . I 'll send someone up to get it . No , that won 't be necessary . I 'm meeting a friend . If you , if you could just guide me toward the entrance . No need to . I see your friend . David ? I brought your cane , Maggie . Danvers , would you please get me out of here . I must leave at once . This man is not my uncle . I know . ( gasps ) Maggie , listen to me . We never intended to harm you . We need you . Now , with certain restrictions , you can continue your life with me as you would have done with Paul Cook . No ! David ! ( muffled scream ) David ! All right , hold it right there . Stand back ! Let her go ! Let her go ! Now , upstairs . There 's some generals who want to meet you . ( gunshots ) I 'm glad I didn 't see it . Miss Cook , Vincent . General . I wondered if you 'd heard anything further from your uncle , Miss Cook . I 'm presuming that he 's dead , General . If that 's true , I 'm sorry . We 'll make a full report , of course . Your version as well as our own . No question there 's something odd here . The whole staff disappearing like that . An investigation will be made . Very good . You understand that with two dead bodies that are supposed to have burned up , and forgive me for this , Miss Cook , you 're not able to confirm seeing anything Vincent here said he saw , plus , an empty power station , and your uncle 's reputation for occasionally erratic behavior , We understand , General . We just hope that you do , too . Goodbye . I , uh , wish I could help you get settled somewhere . Oh , no , thank you . Well , however , when you pass hotels you might try checking the lobby . Goodbye , Maggie . Goodbye . NARRATOR : David Vincent will seek out the invader again facing a world that cannot believe him . Not quite so alone now . For he has found another who does believe . A girl of courage and spirit . A girl of vision .

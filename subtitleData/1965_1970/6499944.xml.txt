 ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) Prisoner : Where am I ? Man : In the village . What do you want ? Information . Whose side are you on ? That would be telling . We want information . Information ... Information ... You won 't get it . ( Bubbling ) By hook or by crook ... We will . Who are you ? The new number two . Who is number one ? You are number six . I am not a number , I am a free man ! ( Number two laughs fiendishly ) ( Birds chirping ... ) ( Roaring ' ) ( Whooshing , electronic whining ) ( Roaring ' ) ( Whooshing , whining ... ) Sir ... Do you play chess , sir ? Yes . Come and join us . I 'm the queen . Come and be the queen 's pawn . Certainly . So ... who 's he ? I can answer that as we play . Pawn to king 's four . Well ? He 's the champion . Pawn to king 's four . Who was he ? It 's hard to say . Knight to queen 's bishop three . I 've heard rumors . Such as ... ? He 's an ex-count . Knight to knight bishop three . From ... ? Who knows ? Knight to knight five . His ancestors are supposed to have played chess using their retainers . Bishop to knight four . They say they were beheaded as they were wiped off the board . Charming . Oh , don 't worry . That 's not allowed here . Knight to king 's bishop three . Who is number one ? It doesn 't do to ask questions . Bishop to bishop four . It seems all right to me . Don 't let it fool you . We 'll keep him under close surveillance . Why were you brought here ? Knight to knight five . Oh , that was a good move , wasn 't it ? I know a better one . Oh ? Away from this place . That 's impossible . For chessmen , not for me . Knight to knight bishop three . They told me there wasn 't a hope . I don 't believe what they tell me . You surprised ? Pawn to queen 's four . Pawn to queen 's four . Maybe I could help . Pawn to queen 's four . How ? Pawn to queen 's four ! How ? Pawn ... To queen 's four ... To queen 's four ... To queen 's four ! Pawn to queen 's four ! How ? ! Don 't worry . You 're safe , protected by the queen . Bishop to queen 's three . Told you so . Number six looks very placid . He 's just a pawn . One false move and he 'll be wiped out . Not while the queen 's protecting him . The queen ? She 'll take no risks to help him . If you want me you know where I 'll be . Looks as if I 'm in trouble . In that case , why do you play ? Why not ? I enjoy a game of chess . Queen to king 's three . You were saying ? Bishop to bishop four ... knight to queen 's bishop three ... bishop to queen three ... Knight to king ... bishop to knight four ... Rook to bishop five ... queen to king three ... Castle . ( People murmuring ) Check ! White queen 's rook , sir , moved without orders . Number two : Bring him in for treatment . Control room to hospital , control room to hospital . Report to chessboard . Man : Call the substitute , call the substitute ... The substitute ... Ca ll the substitute . Remove white queen 's rook to hospital . Remove white queen 's rook to hospital ! ( Siren wailing ... ) Remove white queen 's rook to hospital ! What 's all that about ? It 's not allowed . The cult of the individual . What happens to him ? He 'll be well looked-after . They 'll get the best specialist to treat him . Rook to bishop five . Bishop to bishop 's four . Bishop to knight four . Queen to king 's three . Checkmate . Sir , you play a fine game . Yes ... Shall we walk ? Why not ? Lead on . ( Applause ) So why do you use people ? Psychiatrists say it satisfies the desire for power . The only opportunity one gets here . It depends which side you 're on . I 'm on my side . Aren 't we all ? You must be new here . In time , most of us join the enemy against ourselves . Have you ? Let 's talk about the game . All right , why do both sides look alike ? You mean , how do I know black from white ? New men always ask that . Well ? By their disposition . By the moves they make . You soon know who 's for you or against you . Don 't follow you . It 's simple psychology , the way it is in life . You judge by attitudes . People don 't need uniforms . Why complicate it ? To keep your mind alert . What use is that to you here ? Let 's walk . You were asking ... ? Yes , why you bother to keep your mind alert . Now ? From habit . Just to defy them . Too old . For what ? Escape . You had a plan ? Everybody has a plan , but they all fail . Why ? It 's like the game . You have to learn to distinguish between the blacks and the whites . ( Gasps ) You 're following me . I had to see you . When do you plan to escape ? How do you know I was going to ? Well , everybody plans to escape till their spirit 's broken . Tell me your plan and I 'll help . Help who ? I like you . If it 's a good plan , I 'll escape with you . I 've helped other people . Why are you still here ? None of them ever succeeded . That 's a coincidence . It 's been valuable experience . I can tell you what not to try . How do I know I can trust you ? Well , that 's a risk you 'll have to take . Not me . Hello . Enjoy your chess yesterday ? Don 't tell me you care . Well , of course . We want you to be happy . Fine . Just , um ... Give me a one-way ticket home . Won 't you ever give up ? What do you think ? You know , you 're wrong . We have ways ... If you drive us to them . I can imagine . It 's all done under the strictest medical supervision . I can guess that ... From the state of the man you took yesterday ! The rook ? Oh , no , he 'll come to no harm . It 's just a rehabilitation course . You make it sound very attractive . What do you want me to do , envy him ? ( Chuckles ) Like your sense of humor ... But we can 't have you worrying . Get in . Why ? I 'm going to the hospital . I thought perhaps you 'd like to see our friend the rook . Yes . ( Bicycle bell dings ) ( Equipment clicking ... ) Is he ready ? He 'll awake in about a minute . Splendid . You haven 't worked for me before , have you ? No . You do understand that you mustn 't speak to the patient . Of course . You 'll find this very interesting . The treatment 's based on pavlov 's experiments . With dogs ? The patient is ... Or was it rats ? The patient has been dehydrated . When he wakes , he 'll be suffering from an insatiable thirst . ( Electronic humming ... ) Stage one . ( Groaning ) Water ... Man : Stay where you are . Water ... Water ... Water ... please , water . Wait ! Please ... Water . ( Panting " , ) Leave it ! ( Zapping , screams ) ( Rook whimpering ) Don 't tell me ... It hurts you more than it hurts him . In a society , one must learn to conform . ( Panting and whimpering ... ) ï¬‚ying softly ... ) Water ... water ... You 'll get water when you obey . Go to the blue dispenser . Do as you 're told ! There 's nothing to be afraid of . The blue dispenser . ( Panting ) Splendid . He did it . You must be proud of yourself . We 're proud of him . It 's been a long struggle . From now on , he 'll be fully cooperative . I 'm glad . He 's given me a lot of trouble . Your troubles are only just beginning . Is he in for treatment ? Not yet . Pity ... Interesting subject . I should like to know his breaking point . Well , you could make that your life 's ambition . ( Gasps ) What have I done ? Why did you run ? I don 't know . Running is a sign of resistance . No ! The will to escape . No , believe me , I didn 't think . It was instinctive ? Yes , yes ... No ... oh , anything you say . Your thoughts interest me . Oh ... what do you mean ? Come with me . Why should you hide ? How long have you been here ? Months . A year ... Don 't you know ? You still hope ? To die ... There 's nothing else . Death is an escape . Yes , and one day you 'll go to far and I 'll die and beat you all . Why were you brought here ? You don 't need to ask . I 'm asking . I invented a new electronic defense system . Go on . What 's the point ? I 've confessed it all . Try again . I thought all nations should have it . It would have ensured peace . Treason ? Treasonable thoughts , perhaps . The joke is , they ... they let the plans get stolen anyway . Joke ? You think that 's funny ? Yes , I think it 's funny . All this to safeguard secrets then some bumbling bureaucrat lets his bag get swiped . You had nothing to do with it ? I 'd die happy if I had . No ... I don 't mean that . Why , why can 't you leave me alone ? I 'm interested . You still have an independent mind . There are very few of us left . No , you 're wrong . Us ? I 'm a prisoner , too . Oh , yes , I 've been caught that way before . It 's a fact . Then why the inquisition ? I wanted to make sure you 're the man I was after . For what ? We 'll talk again . ( Phone beeps ) Yes ? Control here . Thought you ought to know , sir . Number six getting friendly with the rook . Switch me into vision . Yes , you were intimidated without force . By my manner , you assumed I was a guardian . That 's true . By your manner , I knew you were a prisoner and subservient . ( Whirring ) Audio . If he 'd moved the king 's knight instead of the queen 's knight he 'd have been covered . Yes , but the bishop would have taken the knight . Yes , and then the queen would have taken the bishop , checkmate . Seems all right . You want a watch kept ? Yes ... No ... just a minute . Doctor ? Doctor : Yes , number two ? How confident do you feel about the success of the rehabilitation treatment ? On the rook ? I think you 'll find he 's now properly integrated . You heard that ? Control : Yes . We needn 't waste time there . Whatever number six learns from the rook will teach him there 's no point in rebelling . The , um , guardians pose as prisoners but none of them would be intimidated by me . They know you 're a prisoner . Yes , only other prisoners would obey me . So you 've found a way to identify . So where does it get you ? It 's a first step . No escape plan can succeed without knowing who you can rely on . What is the plan ? First things first . Let 's , uh , let 's find our reliable men . Excuse me . Yes ? Like a word with you . Well , you 'll have to wait . All right . Forget it . Guardian . What do you think ? Something wrong , sir ? You paint this ? Well , yes . If it 's not satisfactory ... Yes ? I 'll do it again . Well , I 'm satisfied . Are you ? Yes . Carry on , 42 . We 'll be in touch with you . Very good , sir . Yes , gentlemen ? Yes , we 'd like to inspect your books . Uh ... but they 've never been inspected before . There 's always a first time , isn 't there ? Yes , well , uh , come in , sir . I think you 'll find everything in order . Audio . That looks rather suspicious . ( Clicking switch ) Can 't you get the audio ? The Mike 's kaput . Electrics truck 's on its way . Do you think he 's fixed it ? I 'd take bets on it . They 're planning something . Let 's have him in for tests . Cat . Dog . Rain . Shine . Desk . Work . Hope . Anchor . Anchor ? The hope and anchor . It 's a pub I used to drink at . Tree . Leaf . Home . Away . Return . Game . Love . Game . Game ? Tennis . Table . Chair . Ship . Shape . Red . Sails . Free . For all . That 's enough . Boot . Never . Courage ... Ever ... Well ? Some unusual associations but nothing significant so far . What about the other tests ? I conducted them myself . Very interesting . You have a summary ? Yes . Uh ... " Positive signs of abnormality ... " Abnormality ? " ... total disregard for personal safety and a negative reaction to pain . " He wouldn 't be able to fake that . I 've never met a man who could . It would require superhuman willpower . Ah ... What 's this ? This is a new experiment . If it works , it will prove invaluable to you . What exactly is the experiment ? A development on research carried out on dolphins . As a means of submarine detection , you remember they implanted transistors in their brains . Of course , we haven 't got as far with humans but I think this may prove effective for our purposes . Thank you . You see the gentleman on the screen ? Isn 't he handsome ? Isn 't he manly ? You love him , passionately , devotedly . You would do anything for him . Anything . You would even betray him to save him from his own folly . Oh , thank you , 51 . Hmm ... the transistor ? Yes . It will record all her emotions for control . She 'll dote on him . Follow him like a dog . He loves you , too . He has sent you this locket . You will wear it always next to your heart . Do you understand me ? Very ingenious . Hypnosis . Quite ... When he 's out of sight , she be sighing . When she sees him her pulses will quicken . And if she thinks she 's going to lose him ... if he attempts to escape ... she 'll be frantic and her overwhelming emotions will send an alarm to control . Good . ( Beeping ... ) Now we 're picking up her impulses . Good . When she sees him , you should get a sharp increase in the pulses . ( Faster beeping ... ) It 's working ! She must be seeing him now . Pulse rate 's 71 ... 2 , 3 , 4 ... 5 , 6 , 7 ... It 's pushing 80 and still rising . Excellent . Thank you . Doctor : When we get a full record we 'll be able to program her into the alarm system . Good . You wanted these reports on number six . Thank you . Ah ... as I thought . What ? Aggressive tendencies . My advice would be a leucotomy to knock out these centers in the brain . No , he 's too valuable . I 'm sure we can help him to adjust without such drastic treatment . Hmm ... ( Starts engine ) ( Blows horn ) ( Phone beeps ) Yes , what is it ? Control here . Number six has stolen a buggy , sir . The woman 's taken another and gone after him . Tenacious , isn 't she ? But do you want us to stop him ? No , I want this new device to have a proper test . No action unless you get the yellow alert . ( Blows horn ) ( Blows horn ) I don 't like it . She lost him . ( Camera whirring ) Maybe we can pick him up on one of the monitors . ( Whirring continues ... ) Attention , electrics department . Camera ... 34 kaput . Service immediately . She hasn 't found him . You 're in too much of a hurry , my friend . Don 't worry ... she will . Where now ? To the crossroads . The electrics truck should be there by now . ( Engine putter / fig ) ( Horn honking ) ( Horn honking ) Get our stuff hidden . ( Horn honking ) You , uh , going my way ? Of course . Yes , well , you have a lot of explaining to do , haven 't you ? ( Beeping ... ) What did I tell you ? She 's found him . ( Faster beeping ... ) Look at her pulse rate . She 's with him . " Love ? " You 're crazy . Yes ... about you . But you don 't even know me . Well , I know how I feel . Who put you on to this ? Tearfully ) 1 nobody . How can you doubt me ? It 's easy , and I 'm waterproof . A slight drizzle won 't wash away my doubts so don 't try . I only want to be near you . Everybody 's near in this place , far too near . Do you think they 'll ever release us ? Let me know . I shan 't be around . Why do you want to risk your life ? We could be happy together . Really ? ( Queen humming and singing ... ) ( Humming " pop goes the weasel " ... ) Hello . ( Continues humming ) Hurry up before it gets cold . Hello . ( Continues humming ) Nothing like a cup of hot chocolate for a sound night 's sleep . Cheers . Had a hard day ? Oh , no worse , no better . Anything you 'd like to tell me ? Yes ... how did you get in here ? Oh , the usual way ... by the door . It 's so wonderful to be with you . Yes . It 's a warm feeling . On a cold night . Nice chocolate . Oh , you like it ? Would you like some more ? No , no , thank you very much indeed . But it was a kind thought . Oh , it 's ... you 're the one that 's kind . To allow me to be with you . Woman : Curfew time , ten minutes . All citizens , ten minutes to curfew . Sleep well . If only you cared a little , I 'd be happy . I do care . Who put you up to this ? Please ? Who put you up to it ? Nobody . Then get out . Nobody ... Get out ! I only want to help you . Everybody wants to help me ! ( Crying ) What 's the matter ? Nothing ... Nothing 's the matter . Stop crying . Sorry to bother you . It 's all right . You 're not bothering me . I 'm not bothering you ? No . Do you like me ? Yes ... Oh , you 're so good to me . Thank you . That 's all right . That 's fine , that 's okay . Would you like some more chocolate ? Chocolate ? No , I 've , I 've got some . May I see you again ? Oh , yes , I 'm here all the time . Thank you ... Ever so much . Hello . How are you today ? Much better , thanks . Good . All symptoms of that frustration complex disappeared ? Completely . Splendid . Watch you don 't overdo it . And keep taking those pills . And remember , if you get another attack of egotism , don 't wait . Go back to the hospital immediately . I don 't like to bother p ... No bother . Enjoy yourself . Thank you . Touche . Where did you get it ? Broke it off one of the taxis . You take too many risks . Let me worry about that . How 's it going ? Need more transistors . Right . I 'll fix it . Ah ... are you coming for a swim ? Uh , no , but don 't let me stop you . Oh , I 'm in no hurry . Come and sit with me . If you insist . You know , you can be very unkind . If I didn 't know you better I 'd think you didn 't love me anymore . I don 't . Oh , how can you say that ? It 's true . If you didn 't love me , why did you give me this locket ? Now , lady , you ... You must be dreaming . You have the wrong man . Well , if I 've got the wrong man why have I got the right photograph ? Let me see that . I ... I ... Just want to look at it . Where did you get this ? Well , you gave it to me . Have you forgotten ? Oh , yes , yes . Not a very good photo . I 'll get you a better one . May I keep it ? Enjoy your swim . Be seeing you . It 's a reaction transmitter . Not voices ? No . She 's been an automatic alarm system following you around . Are the pieces of it any use to you ? All I need . When can you be ready ? Tonight . This time tomorrow , we 'll be free . Yes , what is it ? You might well ask . Look ... your latest gadget 's packed up . Well , there must be some fault in the machinery . Or maybe he 's discovered it . They were on the beach . Let us see if we can find them . Ah , there she is . It 's gone ! The locket 's gone ! Could it have come off in the water ? I don 't know . Where 's number six ? Your lucky day . I wouldn 't like to have been in your shoes if we 'd lost him . Anything else you need ? No . I 'll go and warn the others . Number six : Tonight at moonset . Rook to queen 's pawn six . Check . Tonight at moon set . Rook to queen 's pawn six . Check ? Tonight at moon set . Rook to queen 's pawn six . Check ? That 's it . Mayday . Mayday . Mayday . Any station receiving , come in , please . Mayday . There 's nothing . You sure it 's the right frequency ? Certain . This is a mayday call . This is a mayday call . Any station receiving , come in , please . Man : This is polotska calling mayday . Polotska calling mayday . Your signals are very weak . Polotska calling mayday , polotska calling mayday . Come in , mayday . Mayday to polotska , mayday to polotska . This is trans ocean flight " d " for delta 250 , zero . Starboard engine in flames , port engine oil pressure dropping rapidly . 3,000 feet and losing height , over . Polotska to mayday , polotska to mayday . Report your position , please . Repeat , report your position , over . Mayday to polotska , mayday to polotska . Our position is ... ( Crackling ) Minutes longitude ( crackling ) Degrees latitude , over . Polotska to mayday , polotska to mayday . We 're not reading you . Say again , please . Mayday to polotska , mayday to polotska , too late . ( Crackling ) : Port engine in flames , losing height rapidly . Will have to ditch , will have to ditch . Stand by , stand by for distress signal . Station closing down . What is it ? Picking up a mayday signal from an aircraft in distress , sir . Where is it ? Didn 't give his position . M.S. Polotska was answering . Well , leave it to them . Set . Switch on . ( Beeping ... ) All right , shove off . Wait till you see the ship come or see my signal , understand ? Right . Good luck . ( Beeping ... ) Oh , there it is . Very close . Let 's try a radar search . ( Beeping continues ... ) Nothing . That 's 12 Miles ; Try six . That 's six . Not much hope of finding them unless the aircraft is still floating . Can 't you signal off a dinghy ? Oh , doubtful . Could be more than one . Didn 't say how many passengers they had . Only one distress signal . Might be saving their batteries . Search in closer . You 'll start getting readings from the high buildings in the village . What 's that ? The mountains to the north of us . Maybe the radio station on the tower can give us a cross bearing . This is control calling the tower , control to the tower . Are you receiving me ? Over . You 're late . Everybody here ? Inside . Is everything going according to plan ? Yes , we sent out a radio signal . There 's a boat coming to our rescue . Splendid , but we 're on land . They think we 're an aircraft down at sea . Rook is offshore sending out an automatic distress signal bringing them in . But the guardians will pick it up . Yes , our job is to prevent them taking any action until that boat is here . ( Beeping ... ) They 've taken a bearing on our signal . Have to knock out that searchlight . ( Scream , splash ) ( Phone beeping ) I gave instructions that I was not to be disturbed . Emergency . The searchlight crew on the tower have been attacked . I 'll be right over . ( Karate yell ) ( Beeping ... ) Isn 't it rather late to come visiting ? We didn 't like to leave without thanking you for having us . Watch him . ( Beeping ... ) Your signal , I take it ? If you 've only now discovered that I 'm afraid you 're a little late . How very enterprising . I congratulate you . But why waste time here ? No waste . Tie him up . How very primitive . I am disappointed . I should have thought that you would have devised something more original . Originality is your department . But try anything and you 'll discover that good old-fashioned brute force can be very effective . ( Beeping stops ) It 's stopped ! The ship 's come for us ! Wait ! It 's too soon . Could be trouble . Stay under cover . I 'll check . ( Ship 's horn blowing ... ) ( Engine idling ... ) Man : Ahoy there ! Are you trans-ocean flight " d " for delta 2-5-0 ? Yes . Who are you ? M. S. Polotska . You all right ? Not injured ? Fine . What about the rest of the passengers and crew ? I 'd like to talk to your skipper about them . Sure . I 'm the skipper . You 've had a lucky escape . Thanks , you don 't know how lucky . Number two : I hate to disappoint you ... But the polotskas our ship . The weather forecast was very bad . You wouldn 't have stood a chance in that toy boat . I 'm touched by your concern . What happened ? Oh , there 's been a slight misunderstanding . You ... You 're one of them . You are . What ? As I was saying ... A slight misunderstanding . You deliberately tried to trap me . I did what ? ! The mistake was yours . We can 't have you maligning number six . You ... mean he really is a prisoner ? So he released you . Number two : You only have yourself to blame . How do you make that out ? I gather you avoided selecting guardians by detecting their subconscious arrogance . There was one thing you overlooked . What was that ? Rook applied to you your own test . When you took command of this little venture your air of authority convinced him that you were one of us . And he convinced the others ? What 's happened to them ? They 'll be back tomorrow . On the chessboard . As pawns . ( Bubbling ... ) ( Roaring ' ) ( Whooshing , whining ... ) ( Slam echoes )

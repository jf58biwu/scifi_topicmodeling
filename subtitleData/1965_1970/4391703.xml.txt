 ( door closes ) How is he ? Mild concussion . Could be a broken collarbone . We 'll know more after the X-rays are developed . Well , he shouldn 't be left alone . Oh , he 's not going anywhere , Mr. Vincent . He 's still unconscious . Is he a relative ? Uh , no , no . I found him on the road . I think he was hit by a car . You 're the first doctor I could find . Well , he 's a very lucky man . ( door opening ) Henry , I think you 'd better come in here . " Henry . " How many times I 've asked her to call me " Doctor . " Henry , please . Excuse me , Mr. Vincent . Sure . ( door shuts ) It 's the same way on both sets . ( knocking ) What 'd you find , Doctor ? Well ... nothing much , young man- - only that your friend seems to have no bone structure at all . Obviously , something wrong with the plates . I don 't think so , Doc . Well ... we 'll make another set . Mrs. Thorne , you have no idea how important those X-rays can be . Maybe , but as far as I can see , the ... You shouldn 't be out of bed . Where 's my husband ? Inside . I think he had a stroke . Henry ! NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now , David Vincent knows that the invaders are here , that they 've taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Sally Kellerman ... James Callahan ... and special guest star Ed Begley . NARRATOR : A small-town doctor has died , and his patient has disappeared , but now David Vincent has evidence- - X-rays that can prove the presence of alien beings here , evidence that he can turn over to a government research project at a prominent Illinois university . Mr. Vincent ? Yes . I 'm Dr. Crowell . Delighted you made it . Did you have any trouble ? Not at all . And , of course , Professor Harrison , the chairman of our special project . How are you ? Thankful you 've brought us the X-rays . Well , uh , let 's go to my office , shall we ? All right , right . You 're sure these are authentic . Positive . I was there when they were taken . Doctor , this is the proof we 've been after for two years . It certainly isn 't a human structure . Mr. Vincent ... I don 't know how I can thank you for contacting Dr.Crowell about this . Well , I had read about the government grant to your project for UFO research , and I figured this is the one place my sanity wouldn 't be questioned . What are your plans now , Mr. Vincent ? Well , I have a room at the Hammond Hotel . I plan to take the 10 : 00 a.m. flight out tomorrow , unless you think I should stay . No , these X-rays speak for themselves . Dr. Crowell will drive you to your hotel . And , uh , keep in touch , Mr. Vincent . We may need an affidavit later on . Of course . Rest assured we 'll guard these with our lives . No problem . I have a duplicate set in my luggage . So long . Hello ? This is Argyle . I 'm in Harrison 's office . Vincent has another set of X-rays . That 's right . He 's at the Hammond Hotel . Where to ? Airport . Right . Take care of that thing , will you ? Ten years hacking , never lost a thing . Okay . Thanks . Where you heading , New York ? Yeah . I got relatives there , two sisters . Should have stayed there myself . A guy can make out in that town . ( tires screeching ) ( on phone ) : Dr. Crowell speaking . Doctor , it 's David Vincent calling . Don 't tell me there 's another delay . What are you talking about ? Well , the X-rays , Mr. Vincent . You will be arriving tonight , won 't you ? Uh , listen , Doctor , I 'll be arriving in a half hour . Fine . Good-bye . We received this wire yesterday morning saying you 'd be a day late . Never sent this . Well , then , who did , Mr. Vincent ? One of your little green men ? Miss Crowell , they 're not little and they 're not green . As a matter of fact , they look very much like you ... or me . Good grief , you mean you might be one of them ? Laura . Sorry . ( doorbell chimes ) That 'll be Dr. Mills . Excuse me . Light ? You really do believe in all this stuff , don 't you ? Your father does , too . My father 's been taken in by a lot of crackpots . Mr. Vincent , I 'd like you to meet Dr. Mills . Dr. Mills . How do you do ? I told him about last night . You 'll excuse me for saying this , but I hope this isn 't just another false alarm . We 've had a lot of disappointments in the last ten months . We stole Harry away from Stanford last February about 12 minutes after the government gave us the go-ahead . He 's the best man we have . Other than that , he 's a very sweet guy . Hello , Harry . Do we still have our tennis date or has Mr. Vincent 's dramatic appearance canceled our plans ? Well , this is kind of important , Laura . I wonder if we can make it tomorrow . Enjoy your visit , Mr. Vincent . The sacrifices we scientists have to make , huh ? She 's really very fond of you , Harry , but ... But ... ? I wish I understood her better . She 's changed- - different from what I 've expected . HARRY : Well , Sam , 15 years is a long time . True . Did you bring that extra set of X-rays with you ? Yes . I 'll call Professor Harrison and tell him we 'll be over . What did you mean by " 15 years " ? Oh , well , Dr. Crowell 's been separated from his wife for 15 years . Laura 's been living with her mother in Europe . As a matter of fact , she just came back . Professor Harrison is waiting for us- - the real one . Well , then you really were in his office last night . Wasn 't it locked ? No . I 'll call us a cab . Uh-uh , no more taxis for me , thanks . Now , Mr. Vincent , you can 't go around suspecting every cab driver . I know , I know , but I have a rented car outside . We 'll take that . Oh , Dr. Crowell , go right in . Professor Harrison 's waiting for you . I 'll get these X-rays out . All right , all set . Good . Ed . This is David Vincent . Nice to meet you , Mr. Vincent . How do you do ? Sam , I was on the phone to Washington again this morning . Any change ? They 've given us two weeks to prove we 've made some progress . Or it 's all down the drain . Mr. Vincent , at the moment , you 're very much like the 7th Cavalry . Well , I hope it works out that way . These are the X-rays . As you can see , this is the left shoulder area . These are remarkable , Mr. Vincent , as advertised . Who was present when these were taken ? I was and Dr. Thorn , who unfortunately is now dead ; Mrs. Thorn , who was his assistant and an X-ray technician . Do you think she 'd come in here and sign an affidavit ? I 'm sure she would . DAVID : I 'll call and ask her to fly in tomorrow . Fine . We 'll also need an affidavit from you . Well , the 7th Cavalry will be proud to go anywhere you ask , even before your congressional committee . But we would like you to stay in town while these X-rays are being studied . That 's no problem . Fine . Thank you again , Mr. Vincent . Uh , please take good care of those X-rays . They 'll be right here in this cabinet under lock and key . May I ask who has the key ? I do . Fine . So long . Bye-bye . Bye-bye . Oh , uh , Doctor , I have a few questions . Would you mind seeing me tomorrow morning ? Of course . Come over for coffee . Thank you . I 'll be at the Hammond Hotel if you need me . Ed , those X-rays are pretty fantastic . Do you think the committee 's going to believe them ? Well , let 's face it , Harry . Any pictures , including these , can be faked . The real question is whether they 'll believe our Mr. Vincent . The important thing is , we believe you , and we 're in a position to do something about it . So your worries are over . Not quite . How did those two aliens who impersonated you and Professor Harrison know I was coming ? Yes , I 've wondered about that , too . The three of us and Harrison were the only ones who knew about it . No one else ? I felt this was too important . I 've kept it all in the family . Then you did tell your daughter . Not even Laura ... although why I shouldn 't have , I can 't imagine . I 'm afraid I told her . I 'm sorry , but I wanted her to realize how important this work was- - but no one else , believe me . ( phone ringing ) Where is Laura now ? Oh , at the tennis courts and getting more impatient by the minute . Do you mind if I go along ? No . Please . Yes , he is . Oh , just a moment , please . David , it 's for you . Excuse me . Sure . Thank you . Hello . Yes , Mrs. Thorne . X-ray technician . Where are you now ? Uh , at the airport . I was able to catch an earlier flight . Uh , shall I take a taxi out to the university ? Uh ... no . No taxis , Mrs. Thorne . We 'll pick you up . I 'll leave right now . Bye-bye . Well , there goes the tennis game . Well , we 'll stop by the courts on the way . Why don 't you bring her to Professor Harrison 's office ? I 'll tell him you 're on your way . All right . We 'll meet you there . Well , I can 't say I look forward to explaining this to Laura . Why don 't I do it ? You 're pretty anxious to talk to her , aren 't you ? Yes . Why don 't you go ahead ? I can pick up Mrs. Thorne for you . You don 't mind , do you ? Oh , no . All right . She 's about 50 , round face ... Well , she 'll be waiting out in front . David , uh , just be diplomatic . That 's all I ask- - diplomatic . Who was that man ? Don 't tell me he was one of your aliens . Who was he ? I think he said he was from Venus . That 's very funny . Actually , I don 't know . I never saw him before in my life . He just asked me how to get to the administration building , and then he saw you and he ran . Did you think we were exchanging invasion secrets ? Something like that . Oh ... I guess I am being sort of hard on you . I 'm sorry . It 's just that my father is a research scientist , and he 's neglecting important work because he 's hung up on this UFO mumbo jumbo , and your being here encouraging him doesn 't help much . What makes you think it 's mumbo jumbo ? Woman 's intuition- - which also tells me Harry 's not coming , right ? Right . Hey , you feeling all right ? You smiled . Harry apologizes . He can 't make it today . You should smile more often . You know , you 're really very attractive . I think we could be friends ... if you 'd try . What happened to your hand ? Why ? What 's wrong ? The scar over your fourth finger . How did you get it ? A riding accident . You 've got that look again . Is this scar supposed to mean something ? No , not necessarily . One more question and I 'll let you go . How do you know I want to ? Your father said you knew I was coming here . Did you tell anyone else ? Why ? Who would I tell ? Answer the question . No , I did not tell anybody . Are you sure ? Don 't you trust anyone ? All right ... I 'll come clean . I was the one- - me . I fingered you to the invaders . The guy you saw me talking to- - he was my contact . And you know how I got this scar ? Falling out of a spaceship . Now go play your games with my father and Dr. Harrison and Harry and leave me out of it , please . Excuse me . Uh , Mrs. Thorne ? Yes . Well , I 'm Dr. Mills from the university . Mr. Vincent asked me to pick you up . The car 's right this way . Mrs. Thorne ... ? Yes ... yes , quite . I don 't quite understand , Mr. Vincent . I simply want to know how long your daughter 's been living with you . About two months . Why ? And you hadn 't seen her for 15 years before then . That 's right . Had you ever seen a photograph of her taken during that period ? As a matter of fact , I ... Mr. Vincent , I don 't think I like this . I know , Doctor . I 'm sorry . I don 't like it myself , but there are some things that have happened that I can 't explain . How do they involve Laura ? I don 't know . Maybe they don 't . But that-that scar on her right hand- - did she have that when she came back to live with you ? Mr. Vincent , I refuse to listen to this . Well , Doctor , I , uh ... I thought you had an open mind . Isn 't that what this whole project is about ? All right , I haven 't seen a photograph of Laura since she was 11 ... but she 's my daughter , Vincent , my daughter . I will not allow you to carry your ridiculous fears into my home . When you start seeing aliens under every bed , I start questioning your sanity . When I start questioning my friends , I 'm some kind of idiot . Sorry , David . I know we 're fighting the same war . Well , I ... I guess I was pushing . I can imagine how it sounded . The pressures on you must be pretty grim . At least you have allies now ... and some real proof . And when Mrs. Thorne authenticates those X-rays and you 've gotten them to Washington , maybe there 'll be an end to this war . Mrs. Thorne , good to see you again . Hello , Mr. Vincent . Mrs. Thorne , this is Dr. Crowell . How do you do ? Professor Harrison 's waiting inside for us . Oh , good . I 'm anxious for Mrs. Thorne to see the X-rays . ( knocking ) Come in , please . Mrs. Thorne , Professor Harrison . Mrs. Thorne ... How do you do ? Would you like to sit over here ? Thank you . Here are the X-rays . HARRISON : Is the light all right here or would you like to step to the window ? No , this is fine , thank you . Mrs. Thorne , if you don 't mind , I 'll have my secretary make a transcript of your statement . I 'm afraid I have no statement to make . I beg your pardon ? These are not the same X-rays that I developed in my husband 's office . What are you talking about ? I don 't know what kind of game Mr. Vincent has been trying to play , but I 've never seen these X-rays before . Well , look ... look right here . You pointed this out to me yourself . You 're wasting your time , Mr. Vincent . I will not sign an affidavit I know to be untrue . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I 'll find a taxi and get to the airport . These are the X-rays you made ; you know they are . Mr. Vincent , please . She 's lying ! I don 't know why . Please , let me go . These are the X-rays you made ; tell the truth . Mr. Vincent , please let her go . We can 't force her to sign an affidavit , Vincent . It would be meaningless . Mrs. Thorne , are you certain that these are not the X-rays that you expected to find ? I am positive . Then I 'm terribly sorry that you had to make this journey . So am I. DAVID : Mrs. Thorne ... What happened ? You made a mistake , Mr. Vincent . That 's all that happened . All right , we 're not going to give up on this , Sam . We 've still got Mr. Vincent . HARRISON : Mr. Vincent ... do you still say that these are the correct X-rays ? No question . Well , then , we 'll have to build our case on your testimony alone . Is it all right ? Yes . You 're sure ? Yes , I swear . It 's all right . Go ahead . Mrs. Thorne . I wish you 'd leave me alone . What is it ? What happened ? Nothing . Well , you know those were the X-rays you developed . Please , Mr. Vincent , just leave me alone . Mrs. Thorne , they murdered your husband . You 're helping them . I know . Help me . I can 't . Why ? Did they threaten you ? Was it Dr. Mills ? The man who met you here at the airport ? No , Mr. Vincent , please . MAN ( over P.A. system ) : Flight 432 now loading at Gate 6 . That 's my plane . I 'm only asking for a name . I 'm not a very brave woman . Please let me go . Yes , I 'd like to place a person-to-person call to Professor Richard Kurawicz . K-u-r-a-w-i-c-z . Right . Harry Mills . That 's it . Listen , call me tonight if you can , will you ? Yeah , if I 'm not in my hotel room , try Professor Harrison 's office at the university . Okay . Thanks , Dick . Bye-bye . Looking for someone ? Shh . You never can tell where one of those invaders might be . Another game ? Yeah . It 's called " Laura 's pigeon . " I let Harry talk me into tracking you down . Why ? The usual nonsense . Harry phoned and said he 'd been looking all over for you . Asked me if I 'd go to the airport and see if you were here . What did he want ? Will you stop playing games and tell me what he wanted ? The Granville Power Company- - ever heard of it ? No . It 's a deserted plant about a quarter of a mile out of town on the West Road . Harry wants you to meet him there . He said it 's important . Is this for real ? To Harry , it is . All right . Thank you . ( phone ringing ) Crowell . You found what ? ! An alien regeneration station at the old Granville Power Plant . An alien regeneration station ? Are you sure of that ? Absolutely . Now , I tried to reach Mills . He said he was going to meet me out there . Harry 's here with me . You ... actually saw this place ? Ten minutes ago . Doctor , this is the best kind of evidence for that congressional committee . How soon can you make it ? We 're on our way . If you have a gun , bring it . Told you not to sell Vincent short . Aren 't the police here yet ? Harry thought they should see this , too . Good idea . Where have you been ? With Sam . Sounds like you really scored this time . You were supposed to meet me here . I know you told that to Sam on the phone , but I ... Gentlemen , let 's not stand here talking . There 's a gold mine in there . Right this way . All right , which way ? Right here in this room . Regeneration tubes ... control panels , everything was in this room . Vincent , this place looks like it 's been deserted for years . Which one of you is Dr. Mills ? I am . Uh , this is Dr. Crowell , Lieutenant Eaton . This is Mr. Vincent , who wanted us to come out here . Hi . Where 's all the stuff ? It was a setup . They 've moved . And cleaned the place out ? They didn 't do a very good job . I 'm sorry , Lieutenant . Forget it . We get all kinds of kooks . Well , if this is it , I might as well go back to town . Uh , fine . Uh ... we 'll wait for Mr. Vincent . I don 't blame you . He might try to fly back on a broomstick . Good night . Good night . Good night . Nothing . Not nothing , Vincent . You 're putting our entire program in jeopardy . That 's what you want , isn 't it ? I beg your pardon ? You wanted it to happen . That 's why you had me come out here . Vincent , I think you 're imagining things . He asked me to meet him out here . Impossible . That 's not true . Make me look like a psycho , and those X-rays go out the window . Harry didn 't call you or anyone else . He 's been with me every second . From the moment you left Professor Harrison 's office until right now . I 'm sorry , Vincent . That 's the truth . Where 's Laura ? Now don 't start with that again . Where is she ? Probably at the university . I promised to show her the X-rays . Vincent . Vincent . ( tires squealing ) I thought you were off chasing monsters . I 'll bet you did . What were you looking for ? CROWELL : Stay away from her , Vincent . What were you looking for ? I got tired of waiting for you , and I was looking for the key to the cabinet when this madman burst in . Dr. Crowell , I know how this is going to sound , but please bear with me . She is not your daughter . ( scoffs ) Vincent , you are mad . Or you have a marvelous sense of humor . Tell us about the scar on your hand . I did tell you about it . It was from a riding accident . I think it was from an operation to correct a mutated fourth finger . You 're serious . You 're really serious . Doctor , if you don 't believe me , check her pulse . What for ? She has none . None of them have a pulse or a heartbeat . It 's nonsense , absolute nonsense . I 'll have to take it myself . Get away from me . All right , Vincent , let go of her . You 're going just a bit ... Now we 'll settle this . CROWELL : Get away from her . Thank you for suggesting this . She 's the one you have to worry about , not me . You 're paranoid , Vincent ... completely paranoid . I 'd better call the police . I don 't know how to convince you two . Look , there 's very little time . At least let me talk to Laura . Laura is in my office , and she 's going to stay there until you leave . ( doorbell chimes ) That must be the police . I 'm sorry for you , Vincent . You 're a troubled man . MILLS : Come in , Officers . There he is . All right , mister , let 's go quietly . Wait a minute . These aren 't police . I suppose they 're aliens , too . Yes , and the ones who impersonated you ! Let 's not have any trouble . DAVID : They 're not police ! All right , let 's go ! DAVID : These aren 't the police ! Come on , you ! These aren 't the police ! Keep moving . They 're pretty rough . Yeah , well , that 's their job , Sam . But he 's not a criminal . Have the police come yet ? Yes . But I 'm think I 'm going down to the station . Well , what for ? I don 't like the way they handled him . Vincent needs medical treatment , nothing else . Nothing else ? He could 've killed me . He 's a troubled man , Laura , and we encouraged him . Now I think we should help him . See you later . Sam ? Do you want me to go with you ? No . Thanks . Just ... get Laura home , will you ? Right . ( phone rings ) Hello ? Professor Harrison 's not here now . Who ? I 'm afraid Mr. Vincent is tied up at the moment , but I 'd be more than happy to take the message . Stanford University . Shoot . Are you sure ? Dr. Harry Mills ? Well , I don 't see how ... That 's enough of that , Laura . Who are you ? Why , Harry Mills , of course . Harry Mills was killed in an automobile accident a year ago . How sad for him . Who are you ? Well , that question is rather academic at this point , don 't you think ? The power plant . You had someone imitate your voice asking me to send Vincent out there . You wanted him to suspect me . Why ? Why ? What are you ? I thought Mr. Vincent had explained all that to you . Laura ! Open this door , Laura . I just want to talk to you , that 's all . Just talk . Laura ? All right , Laura , stay there if you want to . Get out , Vincent . ( car door slamming ) What happens when I don 't show up at the station ? No one will know that , Mr. Vincent . We 'll send back reports that you 're under intensive psychiatric care . They 'll never believe it . You 're forgetting we have someone very close to the program . He 'll convince them . He ? Let 's go . This way . Laura ? Open the door . I promise , I won 't hurt you . Laura ? Laura ? There 's nothing to be afraid of , Laura . Stay away from me . I just want to talk to you , that 's all . Explain . I 'm warning you , Harry , there 's nitric acid in this bottle . I 'm sorry , Laura . ( gunshot ) It was water . It was only water . I still can 't believe that Mills was one of them . I went to the police . He had never called them . We have to face it , Ed . Mills was probably diverting most of the valid information that came to us . All right . So now we know they 're here , but we don 't have one tangible bit of proof . You still have my affidavit . CROWELL : And Laura . If she testifies to what she saw , I 'm sure we could keep the program going a few more months . How about it , Laura ? Join our crackpot club ? Of course , I will . Well , then , Mr. Vincent , we 'll hold up our end , and if anytime you need a hand ... Thank you . I couldn 't ask for more . Yes ... you could ask for a heartfelt apology from all of us . And you 'd get it , too . Laura . Can I walk you to the car ? Sam , we 'd better start picking up the pieces , get this program moving again . Can I ask you something , Ed ? Before today ... have you ever had doubts about what we 're doing ? Well , I guess we all did , Sam . NARRATOR : There are millions who doubt ... some who suspect ... a handful who know . David Vincent seeks to reveal the dark face of the invader so that , before it is too late , the millions who doubt will know .

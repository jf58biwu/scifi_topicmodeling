 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . [ Men Shouting ] Tony ! [ Shouts ] The great Capitan Beal and his dreaded Barbary pirates . If you expect me to plead for my life , you are wrong . - I do not ask favors of murderers . - Murderers ? - A pack of cowardly wolves , preying on unarmed ships . - You 're a brave man , Captain . You 're also a stupid one . You talk too much . Shall we say you talked yourself to death ? Hampton , get him out of my sight . All right . Who 's next ? I got a couple of strange-looking ones here , Captain . You heard him . Move ! - If he won 't walk , drag ' im over here . - Leave him alone ! Ain 't you the brave one ? I oughta cut your ears off and use ' em for fish bait . Now , what have we got here ? Let 's see your hands . No calluses . Give me your hands . You 're not seamen . a couple of rich young gentlemen perhaps . You 've made a mistake , Captain . We haven 't got any money . Don 't lie to me ! Must be someone willing ' to pay a ransom for your release . I have some relatives in Philadelphia . Only trouble is they haven 't been born yet . You makin ' fun of me ? He meant no offense , Captain . It 's just that he 's been locked up for so long ... - without any food or water . - Oh . Well . [ Chuckles ] Let 's give him some refreshment . [ Laughing ] - It 's a little too strong for my taste . - No money and no friends . A very sad and dangerous situation for you . - What do you intend to do with us ? - Well ... it wouldn 't be too hard to figure out something . Maybe we could make some kind of , uh , arrangement . Arrangement ? You could give us our freedom now , and we could make some arrangement to pay you later . - How do I know you 'll keep your promise ? - You trust us . - Yes . - I trust no one . All right , Hampton ! Take these scum away and shoot ' em . [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . All right , no sense dragging ' this out . Captain , you just can 't take us out and shoot us for no reason whatsoever . That 's where you 're wrong . I can do anything I want . [ Boy ] Leave me alone . ! Get your hands off me . ! All right , who might you be ? I-I 'm - I 'm Armando del Geddeo , senor . I 'm the nephew of the king of Spain . Well , now . [ Chuckling ] Is that a fact ? I demand the respect and treatment ... due a person of my birth and station . You be careful how you talk to me , boy . You 're not in a position to demand anything . My uncle will pay any amount for my safe return , senor . Well , now , that 's better . [ Chuckles ] I thought all we got from that Spanish ship ... was a cargo of olive oil and spices . Why , we got ourselves a real prize . He 's worth his weight in gold , Captain . He certainly is ... and we 're gonna take care of him like a basket of eggs . Mr. Hampton ? Thought I gave you a job to do . It 's a pleasure , Captain . Senor del Geddeo - Captain Beal seems to feel confident that your ransom will be paid . No price will be too high for my safe release , senor . Well , if you were to guarantee payment for us , they 'd take your word for it . We 'd be eternally in your debt . And someday , someplace , we 'd find a way to repay your debt . - I would like to help - - You just think about your own skin , boy . That 's all that counts . Get ' em out of my sight . You 've had your say . Or you want me to kill you right before the boy ? Wait ! You can 't kill them . I need them , for myself , as - as servants . - As servants ? - You said yourself I had to be well taken care of ... and you 'll be too busy with your ship to really look after me . I don 't know . We haven 't got any men to spare for servants . - What if I get sick or hurt ? - You may be right . - Mr. Hampton , take the irons off 'em . - But Captain - Are you questioning my orders ? - Get ' em off ! . - I 'm indebted to you , senor . I didn 't do this as a favor for you . I did it for myself . You two look after him and do it good . Your lives depend on it . Thank you . We thought we had come to the end of the line . We 're very grateful to you , Armando . I just couldn 't let them murder you . You 're Americans ? Yes . I 'm Doug Phillips , and this is my friend Tony Newman . My pleasure , senor . Captain Beal spoiled my fun for now , but I 'll get you . - Take my word for it . - Bloodthirsty brute . Get these prisoners out of here . Come on ! [ Doug ] Nothing would give him more pleasure than to cut our throats . - Do you know where we are ? - I don 't know ... but I heard one of the pirates say we were leaving ... as soon as they put fresh water and food on the ship . Probably a stopover base where they reprovision . - Armando , what year is this ? - 1 805 . - And what month ? - April . Are you sure you two are all right ? - [ Chuckling ] - [ Chuckling ] If you only knew , Armando . - General Kirk . - Good evening , Ann . Ben . It 's very late , sir . I brought Dr. Berkhart , sir . What for ? I 'm fine . Perfectly fine . I 'm a little tired , perhaps , but I certainly don 't need a doctor . General , you look like a man on the verge of total exhaustion . - Now let me check you . - I 'm all right . I haven 't time for nonsense . Ann , I think I 've located them . Time , about 1 805 or ' 06 , an island not too far from the Barbary Coast . Very well , General . If you refuse to take advantage of my services ... there 's no need for me to remain here . - Good night , Ann . - Doctor - - Ben . [ Chuckling ] Ben , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean what I said . Oh , yes , you did - But I 'll excuse you just the same . Ann , check these coordinates . Ben , it 's just the pressure and the worry about Tony and Doug . I understand . But after tomorrow , you 'll be someone else 's responsibility . - After tomorrow ? - My replacement is due to arrive . Remember ? My retirement date . I hadn 't realized it was gonna happen so soon . I 'll miss you , Ben . Oh , yes , but for a very short while . You 're too busy with the Time Tunnel to think about much else . - Good night . - Good night , Ben . - [ Frequency Beeping ] - I 'm getting a signal . [ Beeping Continues ] - [ Whispering ] Armando . - What - We 're getting out of here - into the jungle . You mean escaping ? There must be a village somewhere in the interior . What about wild animals ? Which ones would you prefer ? The ones in the jungle or the ones here on the beach ? I 'm ready . Hold it . Let 's rest a minute . How far do you think we 've walked ? I don 't know . It 's hard to tell in this jungle . Beal probably knows we 're gone by now . Yeah . - You all right , Armando ? - I 'm fine . [ Animal Snarls ] Maybe we better keep moving . Look , I 'll carry you for a while , Armando . - I 'm not tired , Doug . Really . - Of course you 're not . A little rest won 't hurt . Now come on . Climb on . Do you want me to carry him for a while ? I 'm all right . We couldn 't have doubled back . We 're on an island . All we did is cross from one side to the other . - Is something wrong ? - Yeah , I 'm afraid so , Armando . We 're on a small island . You mean they 're going to catch us ? No . Not if we can help it . You tried to escape . You took the boy with you . Well , I got a special punishment for thieves . Before I 'm through , you 're gonna wish ... I 'd killed you here , quick . Take ' em back to the camp . If you two have any prayers to say ... you better get ' em over with in a hurry . And whatever it is you 're thinking , don 't . I 'd hate to spoil the captain 's pleasure by cutting you down . - Armando . What happened ? - He talked when he should have listened . Next time , he 'll know better . A man hitting a boy ? Oh , you ought to be real proud of yourself . A few slaps won 't hurt him any . Make him remember me when he 's at his palace ... and people are calling him " " Your Royal Highness . " Huh ? [ Chuckles ] Let 's get this thing started . Where 's Mali ? Here he is . Gentlemen , I want you to meet Mali . Unfortunately , he doesn 't talk , but he listens real good . Mali , kill ' em both . But do it slow . I want to enjoy it . We 'll rush him . Maybe we can take him by surprise . - It 's worth a try . - When I give the word . - Okay , now . - [ Both Shouting ] [ Clamoring ] [ Shouting ] Hold it . Let 's try to trick him . Get around behind him . [ Shouting Continues ] - It 's the Sheba Queen . - I got eyes , Mr. Hampton . What 's it doing there ? It just took on fresh supplies last week . I wouldn 't know , sir . Better find out then , hadn 't we ? You stay with me this time . I 'm really gonna take care of you personally . - What about these two ? - Take ' em up to the beach . - Move it ! - Get on with you . Come on . If I 'm interrupting anything important , you can throw me out but gently , of course . - Good morning , Doctor . I hear you were up early this morning - with the general . So you 're being retired . There are still plenty of places where your medical experience can be utilized . Sixty-year-old doctors aren 't starting new medical careers . [ Whirring ] Ann , we 're beginning to get some coordination . Increase your power-limit setting . - Increased . - All right . Let 's try full power on the automatic setting . [ Frequency Beeping ] There 's an image coming through . Armando . What 's going on ? Captain Beal looks all excited . Three American naval boats are headed right to this island . - Are you sure ? - That 's why the pirates ' boat returned . - To warn Captain Beal . - Three American naval boats ? What could they be doing in this area ? I don 't know . I wish I could remember my history better . 1 805 . 1 805-The Barbary Coast war . But who was it - John PaulJones or Stephen Decatur ? This is an island , not the Barbary Coast . I know that , but it could be one of the places ... used by the Barbary pirates as a supply station . Decatur could have fought a battle right here . If that 's so , he 'll shell this beach . Look , we 've gotta get this boy out of here . We 'll make a break for it and head inland . Beal will be too busy to follow us this time . No , wait . There 's a dory a little way up the beach . - Yeah , I know it . So what ? - We can take it out to sea . No , you can 't head out in the open sea ... with no food or water in an open boat . We won 't be going to sea . We 'll just get off the island , and then , when the American ships arrive ... we 'll have one of them pick us up . - Hey , it might work . - It 's got to work . Hampton 's out to get us if Beal doesn 't . Captain Beal wants you . What are you doing here ? You better come along too . - We 're in no condition to move right now . - He says now . Or would you rather remain here permanently ? - Get on your feet . - Whatever you say , Mr. Hampton . Move ! [ Chuckling ] Ann , switch off the image . If we 're gonna try to bring the boys back again ... we 're going to need all our radiation power . - Yes , sir . - [ Ray ] General ? General , I 've pinpointed the exact month and day ... that Tony and Doug are living in - April 1 0 , 1 805 . Well , listen to this . " " On April 1 0 , 1 805 , Stephen Decatur was engaged in his first battle ... " " with a group of the Barbary pirates . " " He shelled a small island stronghold ... causing great damage and loss of life . " You only have a few hours to get them out of there . Let 's make a try . I don 't suppose there 's anything I can do ? Just stay out of the way , Ben . Yes . Pull ! Put your backs into it . Come on , we haven 't got all day . You two start setting up those sandbags . Come on ! Well , that goes for you , too , nephew of the king of Spain . [ Hampton Laughs ] Keep your eyes on ' em . We 've gotta get to that dory , Tony . Those American ships are due to show up at any time . I know . What about those two ? You would be foolish to overpower them . Now , don 't you believe that , Armando . We just got our second wind in that last fight . We 've got two shovels , and a whole beach full of sand . All right . Let 's get them over here . Armando , you 're not doing anything more . You drop that sack . I haven 't got time to explain now . Just start yelling that you refuse to work . I am stopping ! I refuse to work like a peasant . I refuse . Do you hear me ? My uncle is a king . I demand proper treatment . There 's the dory , straight ahead . [ Gunshot ] All right ! Stand where you are . So you don 't like my company . Give those two a saltwater bath . Uh-uh . You stay here with me , huh ? [ Chuckles ] You 're valuable cargo , boy . [ Men Chuckling ] Well , I hope you gentlemen are comfortable . That tide 'll be coming in pretty soon . They will drown . I 'll pay their ransom . Boy , you 're not gonna spoil my pleasure . No , sir . Not for all the gold in Spain . [ Men Laughing ] [ Cannons Firing ] The boats ! Let 's go , boy . You can 't leave Doug and Tony here . - Who cares what happens to them ? - Please , Captain Beal . - Get on with you . Go on . - No ! I won 't go ! I won 't ! - Armando . - I 'll have you free in a second . Give me the sword . How did you get away from Beal ? There was a big explosion near us . It gave me a chance to run . Let 's try for the dory . [ Cannon Fires ] Doug ! Look . It 's out of control . [ Gunshot ] Tony ! Stand away from him , or you 'll get what he did . I told you they 'd come this way . - The boy let ' em loose . - Us risking ' our lives to save him . Let the boy go . He 's of no more use to you . I 'm sailing out of here , and he goes with me . Pick him up . The other one 's dead . Bring him with us . Are you going to try to bring ' em back now ? A moment ago , when Doug was with him , I might have tried ... but now they 're separated . That 's an American boat . He 's gonna swim out to it . We 'll follow Tony until we 're sure of his location . When do you think we can get a fix ? " " When " ? You mean if we can get a fix on him . - Take ' em to the cabin . - Move ! We 've got to get them off that pirate ship . Decatur 's gonna blow it to pieces - Doug and the boy along with it . [ Cannons Firing ] Captain ? Prisoner , sir . We fished him out of the water . - Take him below and put him in irons , Mr.Johnson. - Wait . I 'm not a pirate . I just escaped from them . Could very well be , sir . We did see him swimming out from the island . I 'm an American , Captain Decatur . The pirates were holding me - Just a moment . How do you know my name ? Anyone who knows about the American navy knows about you , sir . Well , that 's very complimentary . Are you gonna attack the pirate ship ? - That 's my intention . - Let it go , Captain . Let it go ? Why ? The nephew of the king of Spain is aboard . He 's being held prisoner with a friend of mine . Well , even if that were true - which I cannot assume - it wouldn 't make any difference . We 're already under attack . Is everything ready , Mr.Johnson ? - Ready , sir . - Close with the enemy . Aye , aye , sir . You can remain on deck if you like ... but stay out of the way . We 've located the pirate ship . I don 't know long we can hold the image , General Kirk . That must be Decatur 's boat . Ann , move in on the pirate vessel . We 've got to locate Doug . If I were there , I wonder how many I could save . [ Explosion ] Armando , are you all right ? Hey , Armando , what 's wrong ? I 'm frightened . That doesn 't sound like the Armando del Geddeo that I know - soldier , statesman , royalty . I don 't feel like any of those ways . Sure you are . You told me so yourself . I 'm really only 1 0 years old . And I 'm not very brave . Yes , you are , Armando . You 've got more courage than any little boy I 've ever met . Sounds like Captain Beal fired broadside . [ Cannons Firing ] - [ Clamoring ] - Fire ! Our outbound contact is firm and strong , but to retrieve him - Outbound contact ? You mean you might be able to send help ? That 's right . We might even be able to transfer him in space . There 's still a variation in the fix position , General . We can 't afford to wait any longer . I have enough power , General . All right , then we 'll get Doug and the boy off that ship ... before Decatur destroys it . Start your countdown . Get that cannon ready for action , you scum . Clear away that rigging ! It 's Captain Beal . Ray , keep the Time Tunnel activated . It 'll take us a few minutes to build up the radiation zone again . Ray , get some of the security guards in here . - Seal off the complex . - Right . There 's nothing to be afraid of , Captain Beal . Take one more step , and I 'll shoot . - [ Gunshot ] - You can 't kill him ! He doesn 't exist in this time period . He died 200 years ago . Captain Beal , we 're only trying to help you . If you 'll only do what I ask . I 'm not listening to anybody - not until I find out what 's happened . Keep back . Keep away from me . I know this may sound strange and be difficult to comprehend . But you are in the 20th century . We brought you here by mistake . Twentieth century - You 're talking a lot of nonsense . What have you done to my ship ? Mr. Hampton ! Mr. Hampton ! - [ Screams ] - One wrong move , and I 'll kill her . Ray ! Be careful . He really might kill her . [ Door Slams ] - That sounded like the emergency door . - [ Clatter ] And he 's bolted it . Stand by , men . Jiggs.Jiggs ! He 's gotten out with Ann . Emergency exit 26 . He 's going toward the northeast bridge - Bridge 98 . Block the north bridge . You . Take the south bridge . [ Alarm Blaring ] - No ! Let me go ! - Come here ! - Let me go ! - Come on ! He damaged our return output . I 'll have to repair it before we can send him back . All right . Hurry up , Ray . You men come with me . - Oh ! No ! - Get - Hold still ! Oh ! Let go of me ! Huh ? Shut up and quit struggling . [ Alarm Continues ] Powers of heaven above . Where am I ? - Come here ! - [ Moans ] [ Screams ] - I ought to throw you over the side . - [ Screaming ] Oh , no ! [ Ann ] No . ! [ Gasping ] Captain Beal . You don 't want to hurt me . I can help you get back to your ship . - You 're a witch . - No . - No . - That 's what it is . You 're a witch , and all of this is - [ Humming ] - It 's magic . - No . No , it isn 't . If you 'll just take me back to the others , we can explain it to you . - [ Shouts ] - [ Screaming ] No ! Captain ! - General ! Ray ! Help me ! - Easy . Easy . Don 't make any sudden moves . You keep back , or I 'll throw her over the side . What good would that do , Captain Beal ? You 'd still be here . Think of all that ransom you 're gonna get for Armando del " " Geddes . " - You 'll be rich . - How 'd you find out about the boy ? I can 't explain that now . But unless you listen to me , you 'll never get back to your ship . - Let the girl go . - Not on your life , mister . We want you to go back to the ship . - You 've got to believe us . - You 're lying . General , we 've picked up Captain Beal 's ship on the image area . Maybe if he saw it - It might work . Captain Beal , if you saw your own ship , then would you believe us ? No , sir . You 're not gonna fool me with any more of your magic . I 'm telling you the truth . It 'll be right there in front of you . You can walk right to it . You 're just talking so I 'll let the girl go . - Just come with us . We 'll prove it to you . - All right . You made yourself a bargain , but I 'm not taking any chances . If you 're not telling the truth , she dies . [ Frequency Beeping ] We 've lost our fix on the ship . - Ray , you 've got to get it back . He 'll kill her . - I 'm trying , General . - Where ? - There . - You lied ! - No . - But I 'm gonna keep my word . - Oh ! General ! Ray ! Ray , for heaven 's sake . We 've got it , General . Captain Beal , look . No , no ! Look now . Now . [ Beal ] My ship . ! My ship ! [ Gasps ] - What-What happened ? - [ Men Clamoring ] Where was I ? Mr. Hampton ! Mr. Hampton ! Mr. Hampton . I want to know how many guns are still ready for firing . Half the firepower is gone . - I want you to have the men get under way . - It 's too late . Too late . We 're sittin ' ducks . - The main topsail 's down . - All right , we 'll stay and fight it out . Then they 'll blow us out of the water . We ain 't got a chance . - I suggest we abandon ship , Captain . - A fine thought , Mr. Hampton . There 's an undamaged longboat aft , with provisions . - Good . Good . Good . - What about the crew ? Forget the crew . I 'll go below deck and get the boy . The boy ? We don 't need him now . He 'll only slow us down . I 'm still in command here , and don 't you forget that , Mr. Hampton . - Aye , aye , sir . - Now you get to that boat and wait for me . Aye . Armando . Armando . - I guess I 'm brave . - You sure are . [ Groans ] - What 's wrong with him ? - It 's his shoulder . He 's been injured . - Injured ? He ain 't gonna die ? - Not if he gets medical attention . Well , so he got banged up a little . That don 't lessen his value none . - Come on , bring him topside . - What are you gonna do with him ? I 'm leaving this ship , and I ain 't leaving him behind . Now look , Captain , I 'll make a deal with you . If you let him stay with me , I 'll see to it that Decatur sets you free . You 'd see to it ? Why , he 'd have me swinging from the yardarm the minute he lays hands on me . Come on . - I got no time to waste . - If you take him , you 're gonna have to take him away from me . I knew you were a Jonah the minute I laid eyes on you . I made a mistake . I should have done this before . All right ! A bullet is too quick for the likes of you . [ Grunting , Groaning ] I never had so much pleasure ... killing a man before . [ Gunshot ] [ Laughing ] He won 't ever slap me or anybody else again . Of course , I could have let him kill you ... but that 's a pleasure I 've reserved for myself . Hampton , this boy has been hurt . You 're gonna need me to take care of him . - I 'll take my chances . - Look , Armando 's no good to you dead . - Don 't stall me , mister . - Listen to me , Hampton , at least for the boy 's sake . I 've got enough problems without worrying about you . We 've only just transferred them ... from one dangerous place to another . At least they 're still alive . In the cabin , they 'd have been dead by now . - [ Frequency Beeping ] - Don 't lose the time lock on them . We 've got to try and do something . I 've set the coordinator . I 'll hold on to them as long as I can . [ Cannons Firing ] Reporting casualties , sir . Eight wounded and two dead . Thank you , Mr.Johnson. Conduct a search of the area for possible survivors . - Yes , sir . - Mr.Johnson ? - Keep an eye out for a man with a little boy . - I 'm sorry ... but I seriously doubt whether your friends will be found . A man and a boy , please . Any , uh - Any further orders , sir ? When we 've completed our search of the area ... have a gun crew sink that burning hulk . Aye , aye , sir . We lost Tony ? It 's almost impossible to hold them both when they 're separated . Our best chance is to superimpose them on Tony . We 'll try for another spatial transfer . It 'll take a few minutes to build up power . - Get that longboat in the water ! - Mr.Johnson. - Did you find the man and boy ? - No , I didn 't . Will you send a boat to the hulk to make a search ? - I 've done all I can do . - Well , then let me take a boat . I 'll let you give this sailor a hand . Take hold and get him below . Now . Go on . Pick up those men . Over here . Go back aft . Armando . Hey , where 's Doug ? Tony , where am I ? How did I get here ? You 're hurt . You won 't leave me , Tony , will ya ? Now , what kind of talk is that ? Of course not . Where did you last see Doug ? I don 't know . The beach . We were both on the beach . Mr.Johnson ? Mr.Johnson ! - Tony , can you make it stop hurting ? - Don 't touch it . Put him right over here . Now , easy with him . Right down here . Doug . He was picked up on the beach . He the friend you were talking about ? Yes . [ Johnson ] Where did he come from ? Just brought in . I don 't know . I wouldn 't hope for too much . Fever 'll finish him . There 's no heartbeat . There 's no heartbeat ! I have everything that 's needed right here . Ray , do we have a firm enough time lock on the ship ? For a transmission , General , but that 's about all . All right , then we 'll try to send this medical bag through to Tony . Well , that won 't be necessary , General . I 'll take it myself . - You 'll what ? - I 'm quite willing to take the risk . - Dr. Berkhart . - Ben , that 's out of the question . - Why ? - You might be trapped there . - More than I am now ? - Trapped or not , the answer is no . General , as of five minutes ago , I am a civilian . I no longer take orders from you . Well , I 'm still in command of this project . Couldn 't do it . Well , you realize , of course , that without proper medical attention ... Doug 's chance of surviving a heart attack is about one in a thousand . You have the authority to send me through the Tunnel . I 'm talking about right , not authority . The right to go is mine . The duty to send me is yours . You sent Doug Phillips out there ... and it 's your responsibility to keep him alive until you can get him back . Ben , do you really know what you 're asking for ? I know that Doug and the boy and other men on that ship need me ... and , even if I can 't get back , I can be a useful human being ... during the remaining years of my life . Prepare for the countdown . Prepare coordinates . [ Ann ] Twenty ... 1 9 , 1 8 ... 1 7 , 1 6 ... 1 5 ... 1 4 , 1 3 ... 1 2 , 1 1 ... 1 0 , nine ... eight , seven ... six , five , four ... three , two ... one . Dr. Berkhart . How - - Did they - - Yes , Tony . Now let me handle this . His heart 's all right . - You mean he 's alive ? - He 's just in shock . A few c.c. ' s of this will bounce him back . - Doctor , would you take a look at the boy ? - Right . Doug ? Tony . You 're alive . They got me . [ Chuckles ] Where am I ? - Where 's Armando ? - Take it easy . He 's over there . Come on . Hello , son . How are you feeling ? Not so good . Who are you ? - He 's a doctor . - Doctor ? - Dr. Berkhart . - Yes , Doug . - Thank heaven . - You call them " " physicians , " Armando . Doug , they saved you too . I 'm glad . Is the boy gonna be all right ? Yes , I guess we can make him well - - Better than new , in fact . - Good . What do you have in there ? - You must be a magician . - Well , I must admit ... I 've pulled off a few small miracles in my day . - Is that going to hurt ? - No . - Is that going to hurt ? - No . I 'm just going to put you to sleep for a while . And when you wake up ... your shoulder will feel a lot better . It is going to hurt , isn 't it ? Well , it might hurt other little boys , but not you . - You 're brave , remember ? - I hope so . Now close your eyes , son , and think about something nice . - I 'll think about being a king . - Oh , that 's a noble thought . - There now . That didn 't hurt too much . - Just a little . - He 's nice , Doug . Is he an American too ? - Uh-huh . I 'm gonna ask my uncle to make him the court physician - I mean , doctor . And who are you ? I 'm Dr. Benjamin Berkhart , sir ... and I request permission to attend your wounded . - Oh ? I see you 've recovered . - Yes , sir , thanks to the doctor . I don 't remember seeing you brought on board . And you-You told Captain Decatur you were an American . - I don 't know any Americans that wear clothes like this . - Mr.Johnson ... this is gonna be hard for you to understand ... but we 're time travelers . We 're not really part of this century at all . Travelers in time . Well , that 's quite a thought . Take a look at these , sir . These are medicines brought back by Dr. Berkhart from our century . " " Penicillin . " Well , I don 't believe I know that medicine . Gentlemen , I pride myself on being a man of logic . But travelers in time - I 'll have to think about that a while . Well , at least he didn 't come right out ... and say he thought we were out of our minds . Well , while the anaesthetic 's taking effect ... I 'll look after the injured men of the crew . Doctor , will they be able to get us all back ? I 'm afraid not , Tony . Dr. Berkhart ... you sound as if you intend to stay here permanently . Oh , yes , that 's exactly what I 'm going to do . My career as an army doctor may be over ... but I 'm sure the United States Navy can use my services . But what happens when we 're transferred by the Time Tunnel ? Well , you 'll be on your way , and , uh ... I 'll remain here . - [ Silenced Gunshot ] - [ Frequency Screeching ] [ Gasping ] What 's the Tunnel trying to do ? They 're killing us ! [ Man ] 1 0 : 30 security check . Dr. Alfred Stiles , respond . Red alert . ! All security personnel , stations . [ Alarm Blaring ] He 's dead . This is a maximum security operation . Repeat . This is a maximum security operation and not a drill . - Seal all the exits . - Ray , look . General ! If you can hear me , help us ! The Tunnel 's out of control . ! You 're killing us !

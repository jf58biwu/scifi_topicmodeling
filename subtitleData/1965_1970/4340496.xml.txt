 Welcome to Harmony , stranger . Harmony ? Never heard of it . Not many people have , Señor . It ´ s sort of ... exclusive . So am I. Where is this town ? You ´ ll find out . It ´ s not wise to ask too many questions . Hey , hombre ... You look like a man who could use a drink . Why you not try the saloon ? ( Piano plays ) ( Music stops ) On the house . - Regulars get one on the house . - I ´ m not regular . I ´ m Kathy . That ´ s a nice name . ( Gunshot ) - Come and Join me , Sheriff . - Whisky . You know me ? You shouldn ´ t have done that . A man needs friends . I don ´ t know you . I know you . I know all about you . That ´ s why you ´ re here . Where ? Here . Kathy , bring us more whisky . He ´ s good . Sensitive ... but one of the best . He ´ s mean . You ´ ve got plenty of those . I could use more - yourself , for instance . I ´ m not for hire . - You turned in your badge . - And my gun . What were your reasons ? MY reasons . You ´ ve already taken a Job . Who with ? With whom . Look , I ´ m offering you a Job . Harmony ´ s a good town . Runs smooth and peaceful . Now , let ´ s be friendly . Red two ... on the black three . - Think it over . - I already have . - And ? - I ´ m moving on .

Well , stranger , fancy living in Harmony ? Not my kind of town . - It ´ s a good town . - enjoy it . Why , what ´ s wrong with it ? Maybe I don ´ t like how it ´ s run . Just obey the Judge - he ´ ll look after you . I look after myself . - It ´ s a good town . - Keep it . You don ´ t like our town , huh ? You insult us ! - He insulted our town ! - Let ´ s get him ! ( Gunshot ) OK , folks , we ´ ll handle him . Now get ! ( Crowd Jeers ) Changed your mind yet ? - Charge ? - Protective custody . Lock him up . And bring Johnson out . Mustn ´ t disappoint the crowd . There he is ! ( Angry shouts ) Stop it ! You can ´ t hang my brother ! He ´ s done nothing wrong ! You promised ! Let go of me ! Let go ! ( Screams ) ( Door shuts ) I brought you a drink , Kid . You know I ´ ve always liked you , Kid . Hey , Kid , how about pouring me one ? No , not now , Kid . I ´ ve gotta get back to the saloon . I ´ ll drop by later . ( Door closes ) ( Jangling ) ( Grunts ) There ´ s only one way out - that ´ s due north . Yah ! Hyah ! Let Justice be done . Order ! Order ! Court in session . What ´ s the charge ? Against you , none . You were in protective custody . You ´ re free to go . The people of Harmony against Katherine Johnson . The accused , step forward . The charge is aiding a prisoner to escape . How do you plead ? But Judge , he wasn ´ t a criminal - he was in protective custody . She didn ´ t know that . How do you plead ? Have you reached a verdict ? We have , your Honour . Do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty ? Guilty . I ´ ll pass sentence later . Take her away . When you work for me , I ´ ll let her go . You ´ re a bad Judge . We ´ ll see . We ´ ll see . Give me a whisky . Hold it ! I been looking for you , Kid . I ´ m giving you your old Job back . Go take care of the Jail . You ´ ll need two of these to take care of a woman . There ´ s always another time , Kid . The Kid ´ s real fond of Kathy . But he does tend to get ... over-affectionate . If anything happens , it ´ ll be paid for . Nothing could happen ... if you were sheriff . Let her go . Let her out , Kid . I said let her out . Don ´ t give me any problems . I ´ m sorry . That ´ s all right . She ´ s safe now . Safe for as long as you work for me . But let ´ s not start off on the wrong foot . You ´ ll grow to like this Job . It ´ s most rewarding . No , Sheriff , you won ´ t regret Joining my outfit . Well , you may . You ´ re Just sore right now . Put this on - you ´ ll feel better . Nothing but the best . I agreed to wear the badge , but not the gun . That ´ s a start . But this is a rough town without a gun . ( Footsteps ) Mornin ´ , Sheriff . I ´ m Zeke . I don ´ t carry a gun , either . But then I don ´ t need one . No ! He ´ s mine . The boys are Just teaching him it ´ s safer to have a gun . Are you hurt ? Nothing a bit of water won ´ t take care of . I ´ m sorry . I ´ m blushing . I didn ´ t think I could blush any more . That ´ s all right . Get out or they ´ ll kill you . Last time I got out ... they dragged me back , and , er , I can ´ t refuse that kind of hospitality . Can I ? You saw what they did to my brother . That ´ s one reason I ´ m staying . He was a stubborn man , too . I ´ ll be in the saloon tonight . - Regulars get the first one ... - On the house . ( Music and chatter ) ( Drunken laughter ) Come on , bartender , let ´ s have some whisky ! They ´ re on me ! Come on , Kathy , you ´ re gonna have a drink . OK , Will , but don ´ t let your wife catch you . Ow ! Now , Just a minute ... Will drew first , Sheriff . You ´ re the sheriff here . - Yeah , time you did something ! - Get some guns on ! You ´ re wearing a star , Sheriff ! Come on ! ( Door opens , then footsteps ) Some of us been talking , Sheriff . Yeah ? You ´ re the only man that ´ s stood up to the Judge , so we ´ re with you . Yeah ? We ´ ll help you clean up the town . You ´ re ... going to help me ... clean up your town ? We can ´ t do it by ourselves . And , Sheriff , neither can you . Get yourself some coffee . Whisky . That one ´ s on me . Come over , Jim . Jim , you disappoint me . Your choice of friends . Jim , old friends are the best friends . What did you see the Sheriff about ? Well , if you don ´ t tell me , I ´ m sure you ´ ll tell the boys . ( Door closes ) ( Piano plays ) And still he doesn ´ t wear guns . We ´ re leaving tonight . I told you , the pass is guarded . You ´ ll never make it with me . Be on the edge of town ... after the saloon closes . I ´ ll be there . The Kid wouldn ´ t like to see them together like that . I think someone should tell him . ( Horse whinnies ) Get out of my way . You ´ re crazy ! Now get out of my way ! ( Shouts ) You beat him ! He was the fastest I ever saw ! Fastest you ever will see . I Just quit . You won ´ t quit while I have Kathy . Get it clear - you work for me . - Guns and all . - You haven ´ t got Kathy now . She ´ s dead . But he was only supposed to ... Rough her up a little . Hold it ! You work for me , like it or not . Nobody walks out on me . I won ´ t let you Join some other outfit . I ´ ll kill you first . You got five seconds to make up your mind . One . Two . Three . Four . ( Two gunshots ) ( Brass band music ) ( Brass band music ) Interesting - that he separates fact from fantasy so quickly . I told you he was different . I knew it wouldn ´ t work . Fill him hallucinatory drugs , change his environment , talk through microphones ! It still would have worked if you hadn ´ t ... But it didn ´ t , did it ? ! " Give him love , take it away " ! " Isolate him . Make him kill . Face him with death . He ´ ll crack . " " Break his mind and the rest will be easy . " Huh ! Why did I listen to you ? ! It would have worked ... if you had kept your head , and not created the crisis too soon . I had no control ! You knew we ´ d get involved , act as if it were real ! So don ´ t blame my methods , Just your own darn lack of self-control . It ´ s fine for you ! I have to answer for this failure ! ( Sobs ) It seems I ´ m not the only one who ... got involved . ( Gasps ) What are you doing here , Number 8 ? The game ´ s over , Number 8 . Kathy ... ( Bloodcurdling howl ) ( Howling continues ) I wish it had been real ... Get away from me , Judge . Get away ! Not gonna hit me no more . No more ! No ... No mo-oo-oo-oo-oo-re !

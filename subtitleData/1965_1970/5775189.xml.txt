IT SEEMS YOU TRIED TO COME DOWN THE PASSAGES AT THE WRONG TIME . AS IT HAPPENS , WE HAVE A ... LOCAL PHENOMENON HERE THAT CREATES SOMETHING OF A MAELSTROM UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF TIDE AND CIRCUMSTANCE . I SEE . WELL , PERHAPS YOU 'LL BE KIND AND SHOW US THE WAY OUT ? THERE IS NO WAY OUT , NOT FOR YOU . AND NOT FOR HIM . NOR FOR THE GIRL ? IS SHE ALIVE ? YOU WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS , NOT ASK THEM . [ Harold ] NO WAY OUT ? WELL , Y-YOU 'RE NOT PLANNING TO KEEP US HERE FOR GOOD ! YOU 'RE RIGHT , WE 'RE NOT . THEN WHY CAN 'T WE GO ? BECAUSE THERE IS AN OUTSIDE CHANCE THAT YOU MIGHT BE OF HELP . I-I 'D LIKE TO HELP . I 'M DELIGHTED TO BE OF ASSISTANCE AT A-ANY TIME . I 'M ONLY TOO PLEASED . AND IF WE CAN 'T HELP YOU ? SURVIVAL DOWN HERE DEPENDS ON USEFULNESS . WELL , UH ... IN THAT CASE , HOW COULD WE HELP YOU ? FOLLOW ME . [ Rhythmic pumping ] BEAUTIFUL , ISN 'T IT ? WHAT- - WHAT IS IT ? THE CITY IN THE SEA . LYONESSE ? PERHAPS . ONE NAME IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER . [ Ben ] I ASKED , IN WHAT WAY COULD WE HELP YOU ? THERE IT IS- - THE VOLCANO . THE PEAK IS PETRIFIED SAND , WHICH IS WHY IT 'S TRANSPARENT . BUT THE PRESSURE OF MOLTEN LAVA SEALED INSIDE OF IT HAS BEEN BUILDING UP STEADILY , STEADILY . IT WAS THE PULL OF THAT MONSTER , THE ELEMENTAL POWER THAT IS IN IT , THAT BROUGHT YOU TO OUR DOORSTEP . I REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS PRACTICALLY DORMANT . BUT OVER THE YEARS THAT GLOW HAS INCREASED . [ Rumbling ] THE SHOCKS , TOO- - ALWAYS STRONGER . YES , THE END IS COMING . ANOTHER YEAR , ANOTHER MONTH , ANOTHER WEEK . ANOTHER WEEK ? YES , PERHAPS . PERHAPS EVEN SOONER . YES , YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE FINAL EXECUTIONER . TIME IS RUNNING OUT . THE ONLY QUESTION NOW IS--WHEN ? [ Rhythmic pumping ] DO YOU HEAR THOSE PUMPS ? THEY WERE INSTALLED BY THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT IT- - A GREAT PEOPLE . SO GREAT THAT WHEN THE SEA TOOK THEIR LAND , THEY BUILT THOSE PUMPS TO PIPE THE HEAT FROM THE VOLCANO AND TO PROVIDE FRESH AIR AND WATER . AND THEY LIVED DOWN THERE , THOSE PEOPLE , FOR A WHILE , UNDER THE SEA IN THEIR PALACES AND TOWERS . AND THEN THEY DIED , ALMOST COMPLETELY ... EXCEPT FOR THEM . THE ... THE GILL-MEN , THE HALF-MEN , PATHETIC REMNANTS OF A GREAT NATION . BUT THEY 'RE MY PEOPLE , ALL THE SAME . YOUR PEOPLE ? YES . YES , THIS IS MY WORLD . I AM THEIR KING . NO , MORE THAN THEIR KING . THEY BELIEVE THAT I AM DEATH- - DEATH LOOKING GIGANTICALLY DOWN FROM MY TOWER . AND THEY 'RE RIGHT , I AM DEATH , BECAUSE THE MEANS OF DEATH IS IN MY HANDS . BUT I AM ALSO LIFE FOR THE SAME REASON . EXCEPT FOR THE VOLCANO ? YES . EXCEPT FOR THE VOLCANO . UNLESS THOSE TREMORS CEASE , THE PUMPS WILL STOP . THEY MUST ! AND WHEN THE PUMPS STOP , MY CITY WILL DIE . AND SO WILL MY PEOPLE . I 'VE DONE MY BEST . I 'VE RACKED MY BRAINS TO THINK OF A WAY TO FIGHT BACK . RAIDS UP ABOVE THERE , SEEKING A SOLUTION . WE TOOK THIS MANY YEARS AGO . IT 'S A SEISMOMETER . YOU KNOW , IT REGISTERS THE TREMORS OF THE EARTH . BUT WHAT HAS IT SHOWN ? ONLY THE INCREASING VIOLENCE OF THE VOLCANO GROWING STRONGER DAY BY DAY . AND THEN WE 'VE LOOKED FOR BOOKS . AH , YES , LIKE THIS ONE . I READ IT LAST NIGHT FROM COVER TO COVER . BUT IT 'S LESS THAN USELESS . BUT I MUST SAVE MY PEOPLE . HOW CAN YOU ? OH ... WE 'VE HEARD OF THE STRIDES THAT SCIENCE MADE IN THIS CENTURY . BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN , " SCIENCE IN THIS CENTURY " ? LOOK , HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ? I WILL ASK THE QUESTIONS . AND I CANNOT ACCEPT DEFEAT . NO MAN HAS A RIGHT TO . LOOK . THOSE ARE MY PEOPLE . IT 'S A HUNTING PARTY , WHICH MY MEN ARE DIRECTING . THESE CREATURES , THEY HELP US TO OBTAIN FOOD . NEEDLESS TO SAY , OUR STIPEND DOWN HERE IS FISH . YOU KNOW HOW MANY YEARS IT HAS BEEN SINCE I HAVE EATEN BEEF OR ... CHICKEN ? CHICKEN ? WHAT ABOUT PENROSE ? WE FOUND HIS BODY . AH , I GAVE HIM A CHANCE . I DON 'T KNOW WHY , PERHAPS BECAUSE I LIKED HIM . BUT HE WAS OF NO USE , SO I SENT HIM OUT WITH ONE OF THOSE DIVING SUITS . I GAVE HIM A HEAD START . HMM . MMM ... YES , HE EVEN GOT AS FAR AS THE- - THE GOLDEN SHRINE , BUT NO FURTHER . BECAUSE YOUR MEN KILLED HIM . I SAID HE HAD HIS CHANCE . SO DO YOU HAVE A CHANCE . YOU SAY THIS IS THE END . WHY DO YOU STAY ? THERE 'S A WAY OUT OF HERE AND YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS , SO WHY DON 'T YOU GET OUT NOW WHILE YOU CAN ? NO . WHY NOT ? YOU 'LL LEARN THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IF YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH . I SEE . WELL , TO GET BACK TO THE QUESTION OF FINDING YOUR WAY OUT- - WHO ARE YOU ? UH , MY NAME IS HAROLD TUFNELL-JONES . I 'M AN ARTIST . THIS IS HERBERT . CHICKEN ! [ Stammering ] YOU DON 'T KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE . THIS IS BENJAMIN HARRIS . PROFESSOR BENJAMIN--BENJAMIN HARRIS . PROFESSOR . YES , HE 'S A FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY .

HE 'S GOT MORE LETTERS AFTER HIS NAME , YOU 'D THINK HE WAS THE ALPHABET . AND WHAT HE DOESN 'T KNOW ABOUT EARTHQUAKES AND SEIMONOSO- - SEISMO- - SEISMOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENTS , IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH KNOWING . IS THIS TRUE ? OF COURSE IT 'S TRUE ! THIS FELLA , J.S. TILTON , HE 'S AN AMATEUR . MY FRIEND BEN , HE 'S THE--THE EXPERT . THE EXPERT , AREN 'T YOU ? HEH , HEH . CAN YOU SAVE MY CITY ? UH , FROM THE VOLCANO ? YES . CAN YOU STOP IT , TAME IT , KILL IT ? OH- - WELL , TH-THIS IS A MATTER FOR CONSIDERATION , AND CONSIDERATION TAKES TIME . THERE IS NO TIME . NO TIME . CAPTAIN ... THIS IS OUR TIDE METER . THE TIDE WILL TURN WHEN THE WATER LEVEL DROPS TO ZERO . YOU HAVE EXACTLY 3 HOURS , PROFESSOR . MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR TIME . [ Rumbling ] NO , LEAVE IT ! I-I DID THAT , UH , DRAWING . I-IT 'S NOT PERHAPS ONE OF MY BEST , WOULD YOU SAY ? A LITTLE TOO REALISTIC , PERHAPS . YOU 'RE AN INDIFFERENT ARTIST , SIR . THE YOUNG LADY IS MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THIS . THEN SHE IS ALIVE AND SHE 'S HERE ? YES , AND YOU ARE ALIVE , TOO . TRY TO REMAIN SO . WHERE IS SHE ? SIMON . TAKE THESE MEN TO THE GROTTO CHAMBER . IT WILL DO YOU NO GOOD TO QUESTION SIMON . HIS TONGUE WAS CUT OUT 60 YEARS AGO . 60 YEARS ? TAKE THEM . [ Whispering voices ] WHO 'S THAT WHISPERING ? OH , I 'M SO SORRY . ARE YOU AS CRAZY AS THE CAPTAIN ? WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT VOLCANOES ? THAT 'S INTERESTING . COULD BE BABYLONIAN . WELL , HERBERT , WE 'VE HAD A BUSY DAY , HAVEN 'T WE ? NOT THAT WE 'VE ACCOMPLISHED MUCH . HAROLD , WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT VOLCANOES ? ABOUT AS MUCH AS THE CAPTAIN , WHICH IS NOTHING AT ALL . I 'M BEGINNING TO THINK YOU TALK TOO MUCH . IF I STOP TALKING , WE 'RE DEAD . DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP ? ALL RIGHT , I 'M SORRY . BUT 60 YEARS ! A TONGUE CUT OUT 60 YEARS AGO , YET I-I 'D SWEAR THE MAN 'S IN HIS EARLY 30s . WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE CAPTAIN IS LYING . I DON 'T KNOW . BUT WHERE DID THEY GET THOSE DIVING SUITS AND THOSE- - THOSE SILLY CROSSBOWS ? HEH , PRETTY ANCIENT , AREN 'T THEY ? MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED BY RIP VAN WINKLE .

THEN WE BEGAN TO FIND OUT THAT NONE OF US WAS GROWING ANY OLDER . SO WE FINALLY DECIDED THAT IT WAS THE QUALITY OF THE AIR , DUE TO AN IMBALANCE OF OXYGEN , BROUGHT ON BY THE PRESENCE OF THE VOLCANO . DID YOU TELL THEM WHERE TO FIND HER , DAN ? NO , CAPTAIN , I NEVER DID . NO , HE DIDN 'T . HE CERTAINLY DIDN 'T . BUT IT WON 'T BE NECESSARY , I 'LL TAKE YOU TO HER MYSELF AFTER YOU 'VE SAID GOODBYE TO DAN . GOODBYE ?

IT WAS DARK AND I WAS STRUGGLING SO MUCH . BUT THERE WERE- - THERE WERE PASSAGES . AND THERE WAS A CAVE , I THINK . AND THEN , I MUST HAVE FAINTED . IT WAS THE LAST THING I REMEMBERED . THERE WAS A MAN , AN-AND THE WAY HE STARED AT ME ... THEN YOU DIDN 'T COME DOWN THROUGH THE SEA ? JILL ? NO ! THEN THERE IS A DRY LAND ROUTE . WOULD YOU KNOW THE WAY ? THE WAY OUT , YOU MEAN ? OH YES , THERE IS A WAY . EXCEPT MY--MY MEMORY ISN 'T QUITE WHAT IT USED TO BE . THINGS SEEM TO ... SEEM TO ELUDE ME . [ Ben ] PLEASE TRY TO REMEMBER . I 'LL REMEMBER . PRESENTLY , I 'LL REMEMBER . I 'VE NOTICED THINGS SEEM TO COME AND GO . OH , AND , DID YOU- - KNOW THEY KILLED DAN ? [ Jill ] HIS MIND WANDERS . SOMETIMES HE KNOWS WHAT HE 'S SAYING , BUT MOST OF THE TIME- - WHAT 'S BEHIND THE ALTAR ? IT 'S ANOTHER ROOM . HE TOLD ME , IT 'S A DEAD END . THEN WE 'LL TAKE THE OTHER PASSAGE . I 'LL GO FIRST . BUT WHA-WHAT ABOUT MR. IVES ? MR. IVES , WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME , TOO ? PERHAPS YOU 'LL REMEMBER IF YOU COME AS WELL . [ Rumbling ] NO , THANK YOU , SIR , NO . IT 'S SUCH A NOISY NIGHT . I PREFER TO TAKE MY EASE . POOR DAN . HE WAS SO GOOD . THERE 'S SOME GOOD IN EVERYBODY , DON 'T YOU THINK ? [ Rumbling ] ANYWAY , THAT 'S ALWAYS BEEN THE PRECEPT ON WHICH I 'VE BUILT MY LIFE , MY VERY LONG LIFE . [ Whispering voices ] THIS ONE , THE RIGHT ONE . IT 'S QUITE A MAZE , ISN 'T IT ? I SHOULD HAVE WARNED YOU THAT THOSE PASSAGES WERE A WASTE OF TIME . SO YOU FOUND THE YOUNG LADY , HMM ? ONE OF YOU IS BRIGHTER THAN I THOUGHT . THAT 'S ME . THEN , IN THAT CASE , YOU 'RE ENTITLED TO YOUR REWARD . IT 'S A PITY , HOWEVER , THAT THE PROFESSOR MUST SUFFER , TOO . SUFFER ? SIMON . [ Bell chiming ] THAT 'S YOUR EXECUTION BELL ? YES , SIR . BUT IT HAS OTHER USES AS WELL . WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT US ? THEY WILL MAKE THAT DECISION . DEATH ? [ Captain ] OF COURSE . BUT WE 'RE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW AN ESTABLISHED RITUAL . DON 'T ASK ME HOW OLD IT IS . THEY 'VE BEEN ASKING FOR A SACRIFICE FOR THE VOLCANO . NOW THEY CAN HAVE IT ! WHAT , HIM ? [ Herbert clucking ] YOU . BUT THAT 'S IDIOCY . KILLING US WON 'T STOP THE VOLCANO . I KNOW THAT , BUT THEY DON 'T . IF A SACRIFICE WILL MAKE THEM A LITTLE HAPPIER FOR WHAT LITTLE TIME IS LEFT ... [ Rumbling ] LISTEN TO YOUR PUMPS . THE SOUND 'S DIFFERENT . YES . YES , I 'M AFRAID YOU 'RE RIGHT . BUT THAT DOESN 'T ALTER YOUR SITUATION . THEY HAVE DECIDED . YOU WILL BE SENT OUT JUST BEFORE THE TURN OF THE TIDE . WHY WAIT FOR THE TIDE ? WE 'RE NOT MURDERERS , SIR . YOU WILL BE GIVEN YOUR CHANCE . YOU WILL BE GIVEN DIVING SUITS AND A HEAD START , JUST AS PENROSE WAS . A LOT OF GOOD IT DID HIM ! YES , I AGREE . AND I DOUBT IF IT WILL HELP YOU VERY MUCH , EITHER . BUT WHAT CHANCE DID YOU GIVE DAN ? DAN WAS A TRAITOR . YOUR ONLY CRIME WAS CURIOSITY . [ Harold ] HOW WILL A HEAD START HELP US ? WILL SHE BE SENT OUT WITH US , TOO ? NO . TAKE HER BACK . OH , AND , UH , BY THE WAY , DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GET TO HER AGAIN . FROM NOW ON THOSE PASSAGES WILL BE GUARDED . ALL RIGHT , SIMON ! SIMON 'S STILL OUT THERE , OF COURSE ? [ Ben ] WHAT THE- - [ Whispering ] SHH , BE QUIET . EVERYTHING ABOVE A WHISPER CAN BE HEARD . WHAT , IN HERE ? YES , HERE . HE TOLD ME . HE 'S ALL RIGHT NOW . HE KNOWS WHAT HE 'S SAYING . I DO . YOU MUST 'VE HEARD THEM WHISPERING . YOU THINK THEY CAN 'T HEAR YOU ? HOW ? THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF LISTENING TUBES , SO WHISPER . BUT HOW DID YOU GET HERE ? THERE 'S A GUARD OUT THERE . THERE WAS A GUARD . YOU , UH , YOU REMEMBER THE WAY ? THE WAY THEY BROUGHT JILL DOWN HERE ? YES , OF COURSE I DO . BUT IT 'S NO USE NOW . THAT ROUTE IS ONLY CLEAR OF SEAWATER FOR A FEW MINUTES EVERY DAY . YOU HAVE TO WAIT 18 HOURS . 18 HOURS ? YOUR ONLY CHANCE OF ESCAPE IS AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE . BUT THEY 'RE SENDING US OUT ANY MINUTE . SO THE YOUNG LADY TOLD ME . OUT THERE ? YOU 'LL HAVE TO . BECAUSE YOU WON 'T STAND A CHANCE ONCE THE GUARDS ARE ON YOUR TRAIL . YOU MEAN , YOU WANT US TO GO NOW ? YOU MUST REACH THE GOLDEN SHRINE AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE . IT 'S NEARLY HALF A MILE AWAY . THE CAVE UNDER THE CLIFF , JUST TO THE RIGHT OF THE VOLCANO . YES , BUT HOW DO WE GET THERE ? THERE ARE SOME DIVING SUITS IN THE WATERGATE CHAMBER . THAT MUST BE THE WAY YOU CAME IN . OH , HE 'S RIGHT , WE DID . IT 'S DANGEROUS , I KNOW . BUT IF YOU STAY , YOU 'LL DIE ANYWAY . SO WHAT CAN YOU LOSE ? RIGHT . SO ... YOU 'LL GO DOWN TO THE WATERGATE CHAMBER , THE 3 OF YOU . YOU 'LL PUT ON THE DIVING SUITS . THEY 'RE CLUMSY AND DIFFICULT TO HANDLE . BUT YOU 'LL SOON GET USED TO THEM . AND THE LOCKED-GATE CONTROL WINCH IS ON THE RIGHT . IT 'S RUSTING , BUT IT WORKS . ONCE YOU 'RE UNDER SEA , THE GLARE FROM THE VOLCANO WILL GUIDE YOU . NOW IF YOU FOLLOW THE GLARE TILL YOU 'RE PAST THE CRATER , THEN THE SHRINE IS ABOVE WATER LEVEL AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE , AND THERE 'S A PATHWAY THAT LEADS UP TO TREGATHION . BUT IF THE VOLCANO ISN 'T ACTIVE NOW , THEN- - THEN HOW CAN IT GUIDE US ? WELL , THAT 'S JUST SOMETHING YOU 'LL HAVE TO ACCEPT . BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GUARDS , ON THE WAY DOWN TO THE WATERGATE ? THERE 'LL BE NO GUARDS ONCE THE ALARM SOUNDS . ALARM ? THE EXECUTION GONG , IT 'S ALSO THE ALARM SIGNAL . ONCE THE ALARM SOUNDS , ANY GUARDS THAT ARE ON THE STAIRWAY WILL COME RUSHING DOWN THE PASSAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU 'RE HERE . BUT YOU 'LL FOOL THEM BY GOING UP TO THE TOWER AND THEN GOING DOWN THE STAIRWAY FROM THERE . AND NOBODY WILL HEAR YOU , NOT ABOVE THE SOUND OF THE GONG . WHO 'LL BE IN THE TOWER ROOM ? ONLY ME , SOUNDING THE ALARM . THE CAPTAIN WILL HAVE GONE TO HIS ROOM . ALL RIGHT , NOW I 'M GOING UP TO THE TOWER . NOW REMEMBER , ONCE YOU HEAR THE GONG , JOIN ME IMMEDIATELY . CAN 'T YOU COME WITH US ? THANK YOU , NO . I 'M--I 'M TOO OLD AND TOO ... TOO TIRED . THERE IS ONE POINT . THERE 'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO TAKE A CHANCE . BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO KNOW WHY YOU WERE BROUGHT HERE . IT WAS BECAUSE OF A SKETCH FOUND IN A STOLEN BOOK . I WAS WITH THE CAPTAIN WHEN HE CAME UPON IT . I 'VE NEVER SEEN A MAN SO ... SO MOVED , HE ... HE ORDERED THEM TO BRING YOU HERE . HE WAS LIKE A MAN POSSESSED . BUT YOU CAN STAY . NOBODY IS GOING TO HURT YOU . GOOD LUCK TO YOU . GIVE ME 2 MINUTES . [ Rhythmic pumping ] OH , BOY . I 'M REALLY SORRY . DON 'T WORRY , HERBERT . I 'LL GET YOU HOME IN TIME FOR TEA . [ Clucking ] [ Rumbling ] [ Bell chiming ] [ Ben ] COME ON . QUICK , ON YOUR WAY ! WHO IS THAT ? NOW , COME ALONG . HURRY , PLEASE ! THAT 'S A PICTURE OF ME ! NO , NO , NO . THAT PORTRAIT 'S OVER 100 YEARS OLD . NOW , GO ! IT 'S ME . JILL ! GO , I SAID ! THE TIDE WON 'T WAIT FOR YOU . HE 'S RIGHT , WE 'VE GOT TO GET OUT ! COME ON . [ Rumbling ] WELL , IT 'S TRY OR DIE . [ Bell chiming ] ARE THOSE MEN THERE ? THEY 'RE GONE , CAPTAIN . THEY MUSN 'T ESCAPE . THEY MUST NOT ESCAPE . IF WE GET INTO THE SEA , WHICH WAY DO WE TURN ? THERE 'S NO LIGHT FROM THE VOLCANO . PUT ON YOUR HELMETS . IT 'LL SHOW THROUGH . KEEP YOUR EYES ON ME AND STAY CLOSE . [ Door closing ] WHERE IS SHE ? WHERE IS SHE ? WHERE ARE THOSE MEN ? WOMAN . PLEASANT ENOUGH ... WHERE IS SHE ? WHERE IS SHE ? YOU TOLD THEM HOW TO ESCAPE ! IT WAS ONLY FAIR . IT WAS ONLY FAIR . YOU MEN , YOU MEN , GO AHEAD OF ME ! FIND THEM ! FOLLOW THEM ! [ Captain ] YOU MEN ... QUICKLY , ARM YOURSELVES WITH THOSE CROSSBOWS ! [ Ben ] COME ON ! HURRY UP ! THERE 'S NO TIME TO LOSE ! I 'LL BE BACK . HERBERT , COME HERE . HERBERT , DON 'T BE ... HAROLD ! [ Harold ] HERBERT . HERBERT ! [ Herbert clucking ] [ Rumbling ] JILL ! HE 'S OUT THERE . HE 'S ALL RIGHT . YES , BUT WE 'RE IN HERE , AND WE 'RE ALL WRONG . DON 'T JUST STAND THERE . DIG . [ Clucking ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] COME BACK . COME BACK ! DON 'T LEAVE ME ! THIS PLACE WILL BE UNDERWATER IN MINUTES . [ Clucking ] YOU--YOU CAN 'T GET OUT OF HERE BY YOURSELVES . I CAN HELP YOU . [ Moaning ] [ Clucking ] CAREFUL . BEATRICE ? BEATRICE , LISTEN TO ME ! TELL THEM--TELL THEM THAT WE 'VE FOUND EACH OTHER . BEATRICE , MAKE THEM HELP ME SO THAT I CAN SAVE YOU . THE PASSAGEWAY , TO THE LEFT . COME ON , WE CAN 'T HELP HIM . IT 'S EVEN TOO LATE FOR US . [ Ben ] IT 'S LOCKED ! [ Ben ] ALL RIGHT , LET 'S TRY THIS . [ Clucking ] JILL ! [ Captain ] " DEATH TO SOME MORE HAPPY CLIME " SHALL GIVE HIS UNDIVIDED TIME "

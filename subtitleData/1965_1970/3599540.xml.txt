 Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on Americas greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony ewman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . Doug ! Look out ! Come . ! This way . ! This way . ! Come on . ! Hurry it up . ! Open the gate ! Close the gate ! You men , take the west wall ! You all right ? I have a powerful headache , Tony . My head hit a rock . Do you know where we are ? No . The soldiers out there were Mexican . Im sure of that . Hold your fire ! Theyre runnin ! Wevvve beaten eeeem off ! . Are you wounded ? No . Those were Mexican uniforms , werent they ? Yes . Do you have a fix on the year ? 1836 , but I dont have the month and the day . Ann , get on the computer . I want a list of every military action ... the Mexican army engaged in for the year 1836 . Yes , sir . Have him put with the rest of the wounded . Youd better get some rest . I will soon . Well , hell die , most likely . All the brave ones die first . Crockett was killed yesterday . My wife had never seen a wounded man before she came here . Now shes seen enough death and injury to last her a lifetime . Youre the couriers from Brazoria ? - Uh , no , we were - - No , were not . What made the Mexicans back off ? Because theyre not quite ready to take us yet . So they send half a dozen snipers at a time to pick our men off the wall ... send their cavalry to harass us . When we brace for their big assault , they withdraw . Are you in command here , Captain ? You can take your pick of commanders . We got lots ofem . - Captain Reynerson ? - Sir . How many casualties ? One wounded , but hes pretty bad off . - You didnt report it . - Not yet , Colonel . It just happened . Very well . But from now on all casualties are to be reported directly to me . Not to Colonel Bowie . Are you from San Felipe ? Do you have any word from Brazoria ? Are the reinforcements on the way ? I dont know . We were outside when the cavalry attacked . Youre Colonel William Barrett Travis , arentt you ? I am , sir . And were pleased to have you here . We need all the men we can get to hold the fort . Youll see that these men are fed , Captain . - Yes , sir . - Captain , whats todayss date ? March 6 . Bowie . Crockett . Davy Crockett . Thats what he meant . Theyre all under the command of Colonel William B. Travis . Before this day is out , therell be a final attack by the Mexican army ... and every man in this fort will be killed . There wont be one man left alive . No survivors . Were in the Alamo . The Time Tunnel . Look at them . They just keep coming . - How many troops do the Mexicans have ? - Ann ? - Six thousand men . - Against how many in the Alamo ? - About 180 . - Not very good odds . According to the history computer , thats the Zapadores battalion . Once they get in position , Santa Anna will hold a conference with the generals ... and then theyll decide to make the final charge . How much time does that give us ? The time there is 8 : 05 . The slaughter will take place at 5 : 00 , approximately . That gives us nine hours to get them out of there . - Get me a U.S.G.S. map of the area . - Yes , sir . It wont work , Tony . You know better than to try to change history . You said youre not sure of anything that happened here except the final massacre . If theres any chance we can get some of these guys out , I say we should take it . But what if the colonel wont listen to you ? We cant lose anything by trying . They seem quiet enough for the moment , Colonel Bowie . The lull before the storm , Colonel . General Filisolas army moved into bivouac about an hour ago . I wont be surprised if Diegoss army moves in before too long . I have given my word to hold this fort . I dont mean to be disrespectful , Colonel ... but I say we gotta take a good , close look at this situation . Four , five thousand men - they could swarm over us like bees over a hive . - We will be reinforced . - From where ? San Felipe . Brazoria . The settlements of East Texas . If they could get through , how many do you think they could bring in - 20 , 30 ? Colonel , thatll be all of that ! My men trust you , Colonel . Theyll do anything you say . God help you if youre wrong . God help all of us . Uh , leave me your telescope . - May I speak to you , Colonel ? - Certainly . Were running out of medical supplies . The laudanum is almost gone . Im sorry , maaam , but you already have all we can scrape up . - Maybe we can get a man through to Dr. Armandez in Bexar . - ltd take a miracle . I dont have any men that Imm willing to risk on the chance of a miracle . Immm sorry . Maybe the colonel didnt understand . Most of these men are gonna die if we dont get the medicine to treat eem . Bowie understands . Hes just got a lot of other things on his mind . Ill get the medical supplies . I dont know how Illl do it , but Illll find a way . Colonel . - You will be safer if you stay below the wall , Mr. - - Newman . Anthony Newman . Nobodys gonna be safe here much longer . This is the sixth of March ... and sometime today Santa Anna is gonna attack in force . Every man who remains here will die . And where did you obtain this grisly piece of intelligence , Mr. Newman ? If youre counting on reinforcements , you can forget it , Colonel . Theyll never reach you in time . I cant decide whether you are a madman or a calculated troublemaker . But in any event , you are a danger to us . Are you here to undermine the morale of my men ? Colonel , at least evacuate the wounded while you have the chance . Sentry , I want this man locked up in the storeroom . See that he talks to no one . Put them both in the storeroom ! What happened ? - You must have gotten another clip on the head . - My visions all blurred . - I cant hold my head up . - Dontt move . Illll try to get a doctor . Wait . Listen to me . If you can , get out of here . We cant take a chance on the Time Tunnel picking us up before the final attack . Neither one of us is going anywhere at the moment . I tried those bars . Theyre anchored solid . Just lie still . Open the door ! We need a doctor ! Open up . ! Theres a sick man in here . ! All thats left standing of the old Alamo compound is the chapel . - What else have you got ? - A general plan of the Alamo . - But its just reconstructed from early drawings . - Ray , can you make this work ? No , General , it isnt specific enough . - Well have to set up our own measurements . - How long will that take ? - I dont know . - Youdd better make it fast . We only have seven and a half hours left . - Open the door . ! - Go ahead . Open it . Captain , my friend is hurt . He needs a doctor . Our doctor was killed . My wife does what she can . How you feelin ? Dizzy . Blurred vision . - Can you help him ? - Ive seen men hurt like this before . Sometimes they survive , and sometimes they lapse into a coma and die . Wheres the nearest doctor ? There is a doctor by the name of Armandez who lives in San Antonio de Bexar . Hes Mexican , but hess friendly to us . - Then send someone for him . - Ill be honest with you . Our medical supplies are exhausted . A doctor could mean the difference between life and death for our wounded . And to your friend . But Travis wont allow it . The odds are 1,000-to-1 the man would be shot before he got through the Mexican lines . Ill take those odds , Captain . Send me . Please , let me go . I couldnt do that directly . But ... if I were ... to be taken by surprise - - I cant help you . Youlll be on your own . - Illll manage . Call the guard in here . Guard , come in here . I want this man taken to the wounded area . Doug , Im going for a doctor . Illl be back as soon as I can . If you get out of here , you just keep going . Theres a rifle right next to you , in case you need it . Ill be back . Tell Dr. Armandez - Just describe the situation to him . Hell know what to bring . Good luck . Colonel Bowie , I want a word with you . - Im just about through here , Colonel . - Now ! Officers dont do manual labor in this outfit . Well , you see , I , uh - All right , Colonel . - Not a word , Colonel . - What do you want ? I want a horse and a way out of here . Youre gonna give me both . I will give you neither , sir . You men stay where you are ! Show me where you keep your horses , Colonel . If you think I would not sacrifice my life ... to keep you from betraying our defenses to the enemy , you are sadly mistaken . Seize him . ! What are you waiting for ? Colonel , I - I never figured Id ... be laid low from ... falling from a platform . Its my innards . Theyre on fire . Now , just - Just save your strength . Well get you fixed up and back in action before you know it . No ! No , Im sorry - Imm sorry , Travis . Not this time . Now , easy with him . Distribute that powder ! Get to the storeroom and find out whats going on here . Let him go . If you need a hostage , one will do as well as two . All right . Get out of here . Those - Those things youve told me ... a - about what you thinks gonna happen - All those things will happen . My wife believes in dreams ... and mediums who can look into the future . But shes a sensitive woman . A little ... overimaginative , perhaps . But Im a soldier . If I must , I will die for my country . But my wife - If its absolutely certain that you know the future , please - Listen . I do have the power to see the future in a way youve never dreamed of . I can see tomorrow . I can see a hundred years from now , and even more . And everyone in the fort ... when the attack comes , will die ? - Theres nothing that can be done about that ? - No . But weve delayed the enemy . Weve given the colonies a chance to arm , to raise an army . Not even that . Oh , it was a grand and glorious gesture ... and the war cry of the Texan , after today , will be , Remember the Alamo ! Reynerson ? You mustnt let them take you . Are you in there ? Tell them Im holding you hostage . - Hes got a gun on me , Colonel . - You , sir ! What is your name ? Phillips ! Go around to the window ... and see if you can get a shot at him . I will give you three minutes to surrender yourself peacefully , Phillips ... with Captain Reynerson unharmed . Im sorry , Colonel . I cantt do that . You try that again , and Ill kill him ! Do you have enough measurements now to try a retrieve ? No . Everything is in the right place , but the proportions are wrong . Heres the storeroom - 36 feet to the north wall , and not 42 . Over here is the hospital area - 61 feet away instead of 50 . Ann , do you have a signal for Tony ? - Still strong , Doctor . - All right , bring it in . Youre gonna try a double retrieve ? - Its the only way werre gonna get them back . - I found Tony ! No noise , amigo . Thats good . Very good . What about you , amigo ? You wanna buy tobacco , huh ? Youve been through my pockets . You know I dontt have any money . Thats right . No money at all . But maybe you know where to get some money , eh ? - What are you talking about ? - You are a Texan , no ? Somewhere an esposa ? Wife ? Maybe a small ranch and horses , huh ? Maybe she will be willing to pay for you . You mean youll give me my freedom in exchange for money ? Thats right . Or I could take you to the office of Captain Rodriguez . Were supposed to take prisoners to him there . He has many ways to gain information . Many . Malo . I dont want to take you there . An army scout like me , my pay is nothing ... and the work is dangerous . So - Take me to Dr. Armandez on the plaza . You take me there , and you can have anything you want . What do you think , amigo ? That I dont know things , huh ? Hes on our side . And besides , hess very poor . - Maybe you have somebody else , huh ? - No , I have no one else . Too bad , amigo . I was counting on you . But maybe the next one I catch will be rich . Now we go to Captain Rodriguez . The battle here will be over in an hour and a half . Santa Anna will rest his troops and then move on to the east . Incredible . Then you dont believe me ? I dont know . Itss beyond my power to judge . There has been a feeling among the volunteers that were making our stand at the wrong place . Could Bowie be persuaded to intercede with Colonel Travis ? Maybe . One things for sure - Travislll bust in here one way or another . Corn supply for the entire forts in this room . Then its time for us to make a bargain . This is Phillips ! I want to talk to Colonel Travis ! - This is the colonel . - I want to make a deal with you , Colonel . What do you propose ? If Id been the enemy , I would have destroyed your supplies ... and done more harm than a whole troop of cavalry . - Get to the point . - I want to talk to Colonel Bowie . If youll give me your word as a gentleman that youlll take me to see him ... Ill come out and surrender my weapon . Granted . I give you my word on it . Can he be trusted ? He gave his word . Hell keep it . - Youd better come with me to see Bowie . - Illl be with you all the way . Thats my part of the bargain . Ill keep mine . Come along . I promised you the chance to see Colonel Bowie . Take a good look at him . Weve given him laudanum against the pain . - What happened to him ? - He was injured when your friend escaped . Youve had your look , Mr. Phillips . The bargain has been satisfied . Seize him ! All right . Tie him to that tree ... where we can keep an eye on him . - How was Bowie injured ? - He fell from the platform . Phillips said he would fall . He was telling the truth . He knows the future . The fort is doomed . Is the fix on Tony strong enough to transfer him ? - No . - We have no plan of the town that includes those buildings . I see . Its 10 minutes past 3 : 00 , their time . Well make a try for Doug exactly 4 : 00 their time . What about Tony ? If either one of them are around when the Mexican Army attacks ... their chances of survival are very small . Id rather save one of them than see both of them die . Up the stairs now . And no trouble . Come in . Just a little more , mi capitán . Thats enough , Dr. Armandez . - Thats enough . - Very well , mi capitán . Whered you get this one , Garcia ? From the Alamo . I was on patrol . The dust here is terrible . It gives me a sore throat and a short temper . A very short temper . Ive no patience at all . Mine is the last detachment in this miserable town . But well be leaving shortly . You want a glass of wine ? Im not thirsty . Courtesy of the American merchants who left this town deserted ... when they ran away from our armies . I dont blame you . This is terrible wine . - Are you a courier ? - No . Then you must be a deserter . And your cause is a lost one . Therefore , you will not mind telling me where Travis has located the cannons ... how he intends to defend the Alamo . You will tell me . You can be sure of that . The only question is ... how much suffering you intend to endure before you decide to cooperate . - Ill make you a deal , Captain . - What kind of a deal ? There are wounded men in the Alamo . Men who are suffering . Men who will die without medical attention . My friend is one of them . Send Dr. Armandez to help them , and Ill give you the information you want . How amusing ! He would have you appease their suffering ... while he gives us the information how to kill them more quickly . Report to the river camp , Doctor . - Theyll need you there . - Sí , mi capitán . Now , lets get down to business . If youll cooperate , youlll be allowed to live . - Can I look at the map ? - Go ahead . The main battery - two nine-pounders - theyre at the south wall . Uh - No , wait a minute . - Colonel Travis had - had one moved . - That wont do . That wont do at all ! Get some men from the cantina and track him down ! Why dont you call for help ? Imm not tied up now . Ill drag you back dead , amigo . Señor ! This way ! Hurry ! Have you calculated Dougs new position ? Fortunately , the trees an exact reference point . Its 3 : 56 in the Alamo . - Youve got to be ready to take him in four minutes . - Four minutes . No . I wont do it . Honey , he was telling the truth . You cant stay here . Even if he were telling the truth , do you think Id go and leave you here ? - When youre through , Captain , I want to talk to you . - Yes , sir . Im , uh , sorry to take you away from your wife when theress so little time for you to talk . Its all right , sir . I have a son going to school here in Texas . Unless we can hold them here ... hes as vulnerable as your wife . We cant hold eem , Colonel . In less than an hour , theyre going to engulf us , slaughter all of us . - No more ! - You cant waste human life ! I said , be quiet , Captain ! If youve lost your nerve , you may resign your commission here and now . But as long as youre under my command , you will follow orders instantly ... and you will keep your opinions to yourself . Do I make myself clear ? Yes , sir . I want the wounded ... moved into the chapel . Do it quietly , without fuss . Yes , sir . Report to the battery on the south wall , soldier . Ill take over here . What time is it , Captain ? - Almost 4 : 00 . - Were running out of time . Or have you decided not to believe me ? - I do believe you . - Then why dont you do something about it ? At least evacuate the wounded . Wed never get eem through the Mexican lines . - But two people in good condition could make it . - What do you mean , two ? I dont know who you are , but I do know you dontt belong with us . If I set you free ... will you take my wife with you ? - Has she agreed to go ? - Not yet , but I can talk her into it . Now , if you believe what you told me before , youll take her with you . Youll give her a chance to live . All right . How do we get out of here ? Ill bring her to you at the south gate . Ill take you through the hospital area . No one will question my authority except Travis . If that happens , you leave it to me . All right . Lets go . - Can you track him ? - If he doesnt move too quickly . Its 3 : 5 . Welll try to retrieve him exactly at the hour . You men form a detail . Start taking these men into the chapel . Captain . Where do I go when I leave the Alamo ? Youll be due east past an old barn . My wife will show you the way . What do you think youre doing , Captain ? I gave orders that the prisoner was to be kept under restraint . He was right in the way of number-one battery , sir . I was taking him inside . And just what directive gives you the power to countermand my orders , Captain ? Now , hold on , Colonel . At least hear me out . If I were you , Captain , I would say nothing more . Youre in enough trouble . You will consider yourself under arrest . Sentry . ! Put these two men under close arrest . What is this place ? - What am I doing here ? - This is the Time Tunnel , Colonel . Aproject of the United States government . - Who are you ? - I am General Kirk . This is Dr. MacGregor and Dr. Swain . How was I brought here ? How did I come to this place ? Through the Time Tunnel , Colonel . To put it as simply as possible ... we are engaged in a time-travel experiment . Two of our scientists were accidentally transported to the year 1836 and the Alamo . When we tried to get them out , we picked you up by mistake . Time travel ? Pick me up ? Nonsense ! Which way out of here ? Guards ! Wherever I am , you had the gall to remove me from my post ... Just before a battle . - Take me back ! - Not yet , Colonel . - Not until you understand that the man you arrested - - Phillips ? Yes . Hes a time traveler from our time , not yours . I want your word that youll release him . You have no right to give me orders . Colonel , your entire command will be wiped out within an hour . - Nonsense ! - Its not nonsense . Its history . This is the year 168 . We know whats going to happen there . I dont believe you . Ray , advance the time setting by 10 minutes . Step over here , please , Colonel . Look . Thats enough . Put it back to the original setting . - What kind of voodoo magic is this ? - Its not voodoo magic . I dont believe youdd understand the explanation , but believe me , please . You just saw what is about to happen at the Alamo . The Alamo ... overrun ? - Total defeat ? - Yes . And me ? That was me . Dead ? Yes , Colonel . You mean ... theres no hope for my men ? For me ? There is hope . Hope for Phillips . Hope that only you can give . Phillips need not die if you will let him go . I - You have my word . But my place is there . Now . I beg you , sir , send me back . That way , Colonel . Well do the rest . Count him down . Sentry ! Find Captain Reynerson and the man with him . Have that man set free . Tell Captain Reynerson to report to his battery . Fire ! Theyre trying to scale the west wall ! No ! Oh ! Oh , no ! Aah ! Hes dead ! Hess dead ! Doug ! Tony , you made it . Is there any chance of getting her out of here ? - Come on . - Come with us , maam . Theres Dr. Armandez . He helped me escape . - Can you help us get this woman out of here ? - How ? How can I ? Her husband was killed a minute ago . Do you want to see her die too ? Wait ! Let her go ! Shes my nurse ! Let her go ! Where are we ? Could be anywhere . That sun up theres our immediate enemy . Weve got to find cover . - Lets get into those rocks . - Itdd be like a furnace on this desert . Well , maybe we can get to the mountains . In this heat wed never make it . Well , Doug , if we stand here , well fry . - Come on , Tony . Help me . - What are you doing ? Well dig pits and lie in them till the sun goes down . I hope were not digging our own graves . Its no good . Itss too hot and too hard . Weve gotta find something to dig with , and quick . Tony ! They dont look too friendly to me . Come on !

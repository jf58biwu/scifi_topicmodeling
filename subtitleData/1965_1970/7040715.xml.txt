 This place charges $ 200 a day for room and board and taking a mud bath ? Yeah , but it 's very special mud . And besides , they don 't allow any tipping . You 're expecting the crown prince of the South Sea Coral Islands . Oh , yes , sir , suite A. We 've had it redecorated especially to please His Royal Highness . Fine . My name is Roger Colby . Oh , yes , Mr. Colby , we got your message that you 'd be arriving before His Highness . We put you right next to him - suite B - as you requested . Thank you . Allow me to show you to your suite . Oh , that won 't be necessary . I 'd like to look around if you don 't mind . Oh , very well , sir . Through the back garden , the balcony - the very last hacienda . Oh ! I 'm terribly sorry . It was my fault . No , really , it was awfully clumsy of me . I 'm sorry . No , it was my fault . That 's one of the nice things about silver . It 's very practical . It doesn 't break . Oh , thank you . Thank you for the use of your magazine , Count Duchamps . I 'm so happy you have enjoyed it , Count . So , that 's James West . He doesn 't seem very formidable , huh ? So you noticed . I never miss a thing . It seems such a shame to waste two of us on him . Oh , you 're being greedy , Victor . You want him all to yourself . Well , as a matter of fact , neither one of us will have to bother with him if everything goes as planned . And why shouldn 't it ? Uh , my dear Count , would you care to join me for a view of the sunset ? I hear it would be most formidable . I 'd be delighted . It is 2 : 00 , Lady Beatrice . Would you care to join me in an aperitif before tea ? Oh , you know I don 't take spirits , Monsieur Duchamps . Thank you very much all the same . Count Vittorio , aperitif ? Um , no , no , no . Perhaps a little mineral water . Do you think it will work , Victor ? It has to , Boojie . But from all reports , West is a very thorough man . The first thing he would do would be to inspect the prince 's suite . It 's probably all over by now . Who 's going to find the body ? I believe the Lady Beatrice should bring flowers to the prince 's rooms . She 'll find it . Oh , the poor girl . I do hope she doesn 't faint . She 's ... she 's so fragile . So it 's farewell to Mr. West . And hello to luxury and all the things a great deal of money can buy . Once we have the prince safely in our hands . How do the Americans say it ? It 's in the bag , old boy . You know , I 've never had a million dollars before . It must be a ... a ... a perfectly splendid feeling . " Under ... no ... circumstances ... alarm ... prince ... " but ... he ... is ... not ... to ... come ... to ... spa . His ... life ... in ... danger . " Talking to yourself , my dear Artemus ? Uh , why , yes , Your Highness , a habit I acquired during those lonely nights on the prairie . Well , I , too , talk a great deal to myself . In fact it 's the only conversation I truly enjoy . Ooh , breakfast ! Mmm . Uh , it 's past 2 : 00 in the afternoon , Your Highness . I enjoy an early breakfast . Mmm . I can 't tell you how glad I am my staff went on ahead to your Washington , D.C. , with all our barbarous , uh ... uh , native food - um , poi , uh , sea slugs , raw fish , ooh - and the ridiculous native costumes . Papa insists I wear them in your White House . Uh , tell me , Your Highness , do you always wear that much jewelry ? Oh , only when I 'm away from home . You see , jewels are a sign of vanity , and your American missionaries have quite filled my poor papa 's head with preachments against vanity , mmm . Oh , what a relief it is to be human again . Mmm ... mmm . I 'm so glad you and James met me in San Francisco and we can sneak off on this lark together and then we can go on to see your President Grant . Uh , well , my , uh , government just wants to be sure that your visit is a pleasant one , Your Highness . Mm-hmm , but tell me , Artemus , why ... why did James go on ahead , and why does he want us to pretend that he 's a ... a Mr. Roger Colby ? Well , you know how it is , Your Highness . A young bachelor , exclusive resort - he wants to be first with the beautiful girls . Actually , I 've been there , you know , and it 's nothing like that at all . It 's deadly dull . Dull ? But it 's the most expensive resort in the world . I 've wanted to visit it for years . Dull , dull , deadly dull . I just thought . I know a place in San Francisco - wonderful food , superb wines , the most beautiful women in the world . Why don 't we turn around and go there , huh ? You 'll have the time of your life . Impossible , my dear boy . You see , I 've already engaged their mountain lodge for the fortnight by myself . I plan to do some hunting . Oh , no , Your Highness , the food there is just awful . Nothing but fat . Uh , so are the women . Mmm , but I love fat women . You see , in my country , the fatter a woman is , the more admired she is , uh , for the simple reason that there 's so much more to love , don 't you see ? Well , that 's perfect . In San Francisco all the women are ... Oh , you 've got to come there with me . You 'll love it . You 've got to . Artemus , all my life , my dear papa and his missionary friends have told me what to like and what not to like , as if I didn 't have any mind whatsoever of my own . Now ... please don 't be like that , hmm ? It isn 't that , Your Highness . I was just trying to make sure that you knew what San Francisco had to offer : theater , opera ... Artemus , Artemus , Artemus ... I 'm afraid I must confess to you ... I did not want to come on this trip . My father insisted we be friendly to the Americans . But I would be less than honest with you if I did not admit to you that I find most Americans thoroughly dull , vulgar and common . Now , Artemus , unless you let me have my own way , I feel I must go on home , and the treaty between our countries will not be signed . And that would disappoint your president very much , don 't you think ? Yes , it would , Your Highness , very much . Then , so much for that . Now , I think I shall take a long soak in the tub . You see , I 've never been on a buffalo hunt before . I would be terribly heartbroken if I ... missed one . We always seem to be bumping into each other , Miss ... um , Miss ... Beatrice . Lady Beatrice Marquand-Gaynesford . How do you do ? My name is Roger Colby . I 'm terribly sorry if I startled you . Oh , it 's just that I didn 't expect to find anyone in here . I must say , my heart is quite in my throat . Oh , would you like some wine to wash it down to its proper place ? Oh ... No , no , thank you . I , uh ... I just came to bring these flowers to the prince . The management gave me the key . Are you a friend of the prince ? No , no , I 've never seen him in my life before . But , uh ... it seemed to be the nice thing to do , what ? Yes , very nice thing to do . Are you a friend of the prince ? Yes . What is he like ? Charming . And a rascal with the ladies . Oh ... Really , is he ? Tell me , um , does he have ... Does he have a wife ? Yes , dozens of them . Well , I think I better get back to my crocheting . You ... bungler ! You stupid , nincompoop , nitwitted bungler ! Bea , I ... And as for you , you 're going to get rid of West tonight , and you 're going to do it right or I 'll cut out your tongue ! A most determined woman . But after all , old boy , we can 't do a deuced thing about the prince until West is out of the way . Somehow it makes checkers ever so much more fun when one plays with diamonds and rubies . Don 't you think ? Oh , yes . Your move . Uh , yes , sir . Uh , tell me , Your Highness , don 't you ever worry carting all that jewelry around with you ? I ... I mean , there are such things as , uh ... Is it broken ? We 're stopping . I 'd better check . Hold it . Turn around . Get moving - we haven 't got all day . Come on ! You put those down , they 're mine . Shut up . We 'll take you with us . You 're probably worth more than the jewelry is . Come on , keep moving ! You all right ? I don 't know . Where 's the prince ? Yeah , that 's what I mean . Ooh ... They ... they took him along with the jewels . Bandits . Did you get a good look at them ? Nah , they were masked . Well , it 's too dark to go after them now . It 'll have to wait until morning . We can 't , Jim . They 're expecting him at that resort tonight . If word gets out that he 's been kidnapped , you know what that 'll mean - no treaty . Where do you suggest we look for them in the dark ? We 've got to do something . Of course we have to do something . No prince , no place to turn . But of course there is , dear boy . Artie , are you all right ? James , my boy , the most marvelous inspiration has just come to me . You had a bad clout on the head - you 're not yourself . James , the prince is going to show up at that resort tonight . You 'll never get away with it . You wouldn 't like to make a wager on that , would you , old boy ? Come on , Jim , it 's the only thing we can do . I don 't know . Look , you know as well as I do that king may happen to like Americans now , but he 's only been civilized for the past 20 years . Now , that 's a very thin crust ; underneath , he 's still a savage . If anything happened to his son during his visit here , he 'll revert . He 'll massacre every missionary , every man , woman and child on that island . Now , Jim , you know we 've got over a hundred people there . You know there is someone waiting at that resort to kill the prince ? I know it . All right , Artie , it 's your neck . Done . I ... I know how you feel about my deliberately exposing myself to would-be assassins . Well , at least I think I know how you feel . Although come to think of it , you didn 't put up your usual arguments this time . As a matter of fact , you didn 't give me any arguments at all . You set me up for this , didn 't you ? You conned me into volunteering . Artie , how can you think that ? And I bit like a hungry fish . Like a very hungry fish ... Your Highness . You know something ? I got a big mouth ! I do hope nothing untoward has happened . Do not worry , dear lady . Time is for the ordinary people . Yes , but three hours late . You are becoming like an American , Lady Beatrice . Time , time , time , always time . Sometimes I think that for them the universe is a great big clock that God winds up every morning . Blasphemy , Count Vittorio . Shame on you . Mi scusi . Ladies and gentlemen , the Crown Prince of the Coral Island . Your Highness , this is an unparalleled honor . Ah ... yes , thank you , thank you so much . Frightfully good of you , awfully good of you . His Highness is very tired ; he 's had a long journey . Wishes all of you a very good evening . Oh , we understand . Indeed , we understand . Uh , please , please , let 's not stand on formality . Ah ... And now , ladies and gentlemen , shall we all retire to the gaming tables ? What 's our hurry ? They 're serving champagne . Not right now , Your Highness . Well , can 't we play a little roulette or something ? I 'm wearing my lucky molar . Yeah , but it 's got a cavity in it . Well , at least get me a drink , then . I 'm freezing to death in this . As long as you have a warm heart . I think we should leave right now , Your Highness . Oh , thank you . Well , Bea , just say the word . We 're ready . That man is not the prince . Thanks to you , West is on his guard now , you bungling lout ! Listen , I may have volunteered , but not for this . You get me some decent clothes . Whose , the prince 's ? They wouldn 't fit . Oh , these things , they 're ridiculous . Artie , it 's very colorful . Blue , that 's the color , blue - I 'll die of pneumonia . If you 're going to die , blue 's a lovely color . Here , you may need this . Oh , thanks . Where are you going ? You want your pants back , don 't you ? Yeah . I watched you play tonight . Your luck was very poor , but now that I 'm here perhaps your luck has gotten better . Monsieur , I really ... Please , please ! Really , monsieur , please ! Would you ... please stop it ! Excuse me . Oh , Mr. Colby ... Everything 's all right . It 's all right , ma 'am . He was trying to take advantage of me . Well , no one is going to take advantage of anyone , believe me . I do believe you . Feel better ? I 'm so frightened . I wish I were back in England . Would you ... Would you see me to my suite ? Of course . I 'm so frightened . Don 't be . Come on . A glass of cool water might calm you down . Oh , no . No , thank you . I 'm all right . But please do help yourself to a drink . There 's some whiskey in the decanter over there , I believe . Do you care to join me ? No , no . I don 't take hard spirits . The decanter was left there by the people who had this suite before me . I was going to pour it out . Lucky for me you didn 't . I 'm very grateful that you appeared when you did , Mr. Colby . Who was that man ? Monsieur Duchamps ? Oh , he 's a Frenchman . Very wealthy Frenchman , I 'm afraid . The banking houses the Rothschilds don 't own , he owns . He was very fond of you , to put it mildly . To you , lovely lady . May your future be brighter and even more interesting . Thanks to you , I feel much safer already . Do you know that Mr. Duchamps thinks that money can buy everything , including people ? You have no ... no money ? Aristocracy does not always mean wealth , Mr. Colby . Indeed , good breeding is often enhanced by poverty . I have two maiden aunts , both poor , both duchesses , who are the very quintessence of delicacy . Quite ethereal , quite pale . Close the door , you fool ! Well , whatever we do to him , it will be much too easy . There was enough potion in that decanter to keep him unconscious for hours . You have the key ? Mmm . Such a dirty way to go . Oh , Victor , I 've done many favors for you in the past - grant me this one . What ? Let me take care of him . I 'm sorry , Boojie . When you 've taken care of him , I want you to come right back here . We are going to take the so-called prince to the mountain lodge and have a little talk . Well , it ... it would only take two or three minutes . And Victor always dawdles so . Do you dare talk back to me ? Oh , Bea , of course not . Next time , Boojie - I promise . All right , get to work . It 's a wonder he didn 't clank when he walked . Well , shall we get on with it ? Uh ... can you manage alone , old boy ? Oh , yes , yes . Easy as pie . Well , ta-ta , old chap . See you at the mountain lodge . Right you are . It 's open . Oh , Your Highness , please forgive my intrusion , but I had to see you . Oh , uh ... Oh , do get up . But of course . Of course . I 'm the Lady Beatrice Marquand-Gaynesford . Charmed . How nice to meet one 's own sort in this barbarous country . Oh . I had brought these flowers for you earlier . Oh , thank you . They 're quite lovely . Pretty is as pretty , uh ... does . Very pretty . You 're very kind . Oh , I could be ever so much kinder . So then , what can I do for you , my dear ? I have come to warn you . I heard some men talking in the garden . They didn 't see me , but I fear that they mean you harm . Harm ? Harm ? What sort of harm ? I don 't know , but I heard them say that they will send here an accomplice first - a lady , I believe - to take you off your guard by ... distracting you , as it were . My dear Lady Beatrice , I am much too much a man of the world to be taken in by that sort of trick . Oh , I know the kind of lady you mean , of course , but , uh ... I can recognize her from miles away . There 's no cause for fear . Besides , I 'm quite armed , always . We 're quite safe here . I was about to have a bit of sherry . Can I offer you a spot ? There won 't be time . Don 't move or I 'll shoot . I don 't think so . It 's not loaded . But this is . That thong is quite wet . But it 'll soon dry out . Then it 'll begin to burn rather slowly , I 'm afraid . You know , you could save us all a good deal of time if you would tell us where you 've hidden your friend , the prince . I 've already told you . I don 't know where he is . Well , I have all the patience in the world . And this hunting lodge is rather remote . What a perfectly marvelous sherry . Dearest Bea , you do think of everything . Dear Bea , what if he really doesn 't know ? Boojie , he knows . But with West dead and him dead , how will we ever find the prince ? Don 't despair , Boojie . It 'll just be a matter of time . Nobody wants to die . It 's burning sooner than I thought it would . You know , you don 't have too much time . Look , if I knew , don 't you think I 'd have told you ? I want to live as much as you do . Well , I must say , you 're certainly going about it all the wrong way . It 's Victor . Victor ? Here , Bea . Uh , everything 's all right . Well , so much for Mr. James West . What have you done to him ? Oh , he 's dead . He met with an accident in the mud baths at the resort . Drowned , I believe . And you don 't have very much more time . Well , don 't just dawdle there , Victor . Come on in . Uh , Boojie , will you help me with my saddle ? I 've ... had a nasty fall . I 've sprained my ankle . Well , that can wait . What about West ? What would you like to know ? Jim ! Put down that gun . One stroke of this knife and your friend here is dead . I said put down that gun ! Disarm him , Boojie . All of you , against the wall . Facing the wall , please . Watch it , Jim ! Watch what , Artemus ? Those were the two who slugged me and kidnapped the prince . Artemus , your powers of observation are remarkable . Your Highness ! His Highness has been here since I had him kidnapped off the train . You had him kid ... ? Why didn 't you tell me ? I wanted them to come after you and I thought you 'd be safer if you really didn 't know . Ooh . I must say , you look perfectly charming in my feathered cloak , Artemus . Oh , thank you . You can go now . We can handle it . Thank you very much . Who are these people , James ? Lady Beatrice and her playmates . Hmm . Why would they want to do me harm ? I think they wanted it to look like Americans had done it . There 's someone in your country very close to your father who doesn 't want that treaty signed . He hired them . A traitor ? But this is incredible . I can 't believe it . Who ? Who ? That 's what I 'm going to find out . Who hired you , Lady Beatrice ? Please don 't be so harsh with them , James . Bea , take his gun . You see , my dear James , I am that traitor you spoke of . But don 't worry , you will both die as heroes . When I return home , I shall tell Papa that you and Artemus were killed trying to save me from horrid American bandits . My three friends here saved me . Thanks to you , everything worked out just the way I wanted it to . Feather capes ! It 's a wonder every bird in the world hasn 't frozen to death . Well , it could be worse - you could be molting . Very funny , very funny . Say , uh ... you would ... you wouldn 't happen to have a picklock on you , would you ? Uh-uh , it was in my coat . But I don 't think we 'll be needing it . Guests are arriving . Outside , please . Ah , here we are . There 's nothing like a good bottle of wine to start a new day , is there ? Well , then , to the hunt ! What hunt ? Oh , didn 't Bea tell you ? I 'm having a hunt this morning all to myself . After all , it 's really why I came , isn 't it ? To my buffalo hunt . Oh , but you 're not drinking your wine . Perhaps after the hunt . After the hunt ? After the hunt ? Oh , James . How can one not help liking you ? You are so ... so droll , so humorous . " After the hunt . " Somehow it doesn 't sound that funny to me . He has a very unspoiled sense of humor . Somewhere I heard of hunting buffalo from horseback with a lance . I think I should like that . Diverting , don 't you think ? Mmm , mmm . Dear Bea , when I return home , be sure I take along cases and cases of this lovely wine . Of course . Won 't the missionaries disapprove ? I 'm afraid they 'll have many more important things to disapprove of . You 're going to kill all of them , aren 't you ? Oh , not I , James . Papa will . After what you barbarous Americans have done to me , Papa will be uncontrollable . And soon he will be gone and I shall be king to do whatever I like , with no interference from the outside . Hmm . But , Bea , you must see the lance Boojie is making for me . It 's wonderful . Come . Back inside . You know what he 's talking about , his buffalo hunt ? Yeah , I know . What have you got there ? Something no self-respecting buffalo should be without . Now , hold it . I think I shall start with that buffalo . Here . They 're too spread out . I 'll try and draw them together . Good luck . All right , get in there . Tallyho ! Very good , my two-legged buffalo . Very agile , very quick ! Tallyho ! Tallyho ! Good show , Your Highness . Almost got him that time . Now , Artie ! Hold it ! You touch that gun and he dies . Now , over there . It doesn 't matter who kills him , does it ? He dies and your countrymen are slaughtered on that island . My , Bea , that was quick thinking . Oh , shut up . Bea ! Get over there with them . Get over there with them ? Whatever are you talking about ? Come on , do as I say . She was going to kill you , too , Your Highness . Looks like you 've hired your own murderers . What are they saying , Bea ? Do you think that I want to spend the rest of my life on that rotten island of yours ? But our plan . She was going to go along with you , but just so far . After we were gotten out of the way , she and her friends were going to kill you , too , Your Highness . But that 's ... why , it 's ... it 's cheating , it 's dishonest . It isn 't even ladylike . Do you think that I care about that silly , comic-opera kingdom of yours and your childish dreams of glory ? But what then ? What , what , what , what ? What is it that you wanted from me , Bea ? The jewels , you idiot . And I 've got them now . You can 't mean it , not the jewels . They 're fake . Like everything else about him . They 're paste . The jewels , they 're paste ! You didn 't really think they were real , did you ? Is that true ? Are they ? Fake ? ! Paste ? ! Well , answer me ! Yes , they 're paste . Why , you ... Ooh ! Don 't you dare ! Put me ... down ! You stop it ! Let me go ! Calm down , lady ! It 's all over . You ... ! Oh , I ... hate you ! You 've just made my day . Delightful . Pâté aux truffes is my favorite . Do you have any idea how lucky you are ? By all rights , you should be in jail . Oh , come now , gentlemen , divine right of kings and all that rot , you know . Besides , I couldn 't sign a treaty in jail , now , could I ? You tried to double-cross your own father , kill me , and ... Artemus , you tell him . Oh , no , not me . It 'd take me all day . Trivia , trivia , gentlemen . After all , I am a barbarian . What do you expect ? I expect a treaty , signed , sealed and delivered . Mmm ... the treaty , the treaty - such a bore . All right , your government shall have a treaty . Your Highness , don 't you even feel a little remorse ? For what , my dear Artemus ? For doing what comes naturally to a half-naked savage from the South Seas ? You 're lucky I didn 't try to cook you as well as kill you . I wonder which of you is real , the gourmet bon vivant or the jolly lancer on horseback . I haven 't decided yet , James , but when I am king , as I soon shall be , we can decide then . Mmm , you will come and visit me , won 't you ? We could even hunt together . Hunt what ? Well , I wouldn 't dream of telling you now . I do adore surprise endings , don 't you ?

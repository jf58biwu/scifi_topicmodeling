I hope it works , Space Ghost . It better . [ GRUMBLING ] [ RO ARING ] Be careful of that flying lava , Jan. It 's no use . I 'm not even denting him . JAN [ O VER RADIO ] : What are you going to do , Space Ghost ? SPACE GHOST : I 'm combining the stun ray with the force-energy power . I get it . You 're making a force hammer . Right . Duck . [ GIBBERING ] [ GRUMBLING ] I 'm raising the power to 5 over 5 . Don 't do it , Space Ghost . It could be dangerous . SPACE GHOST : Have to take that chance . Gotta get that thing forced back into its own element . seal it in . Here goes . SPACE GHOST : He 's going in . Jan , Jace , he 's in . seal the crater , and fast . Okay , Space Ghost .

Maybe they 're the ones who got Jan and Jace . This stun-ray should discourage them . I 'II follow the other one . He might lead me to Jan and Jace . [ BATS SCREECHING ] So you failed to take care of Space Ghost , eh ? Very well , then I must eliminate his spies . [ RUMBLING ] - Space Ghost . - And just in time . - release your prisoners . - On the contrary . Surrender to me , Space Ghost , or your friends die . [ THUDS ] JACE : bull 's-eye , BIip .

Which is the same area a ship full of colonists disappeared in yesterday . Come on , BIip . We 'd better do some investigating . I wonder what these lizard creeps are going to do with us . Look . Over there . - There 's your answer . JAN : What 's happening , Jace ? What 's in those cages ? JACE : people . These Iizard creeps are space sIavers . JAN : Space sIavers ? I 've heard of them . They hijack ships and sell the passengers into slavery . Space Ghost 's been trying to break that up for a Iong time . Yeah . well , in this case , the sooner the better . SPACE GHOST : Okay , BIip , this is where the twins disappeared . We 'd better go on inviso-power , just in case . Now , Iet 's see if we can find who 's got the twins . I was right . Take a look below us , BIip . That 's a weird-Iooking ship . Let 's tail them . One of the cargo ships is coming in to pick up more slaves . Bring them in through entrance 0-3 . SPACE GHOST : This must be their secret base . We 'd better move in fast before the doors close . So this is where that slave ring operates .

[ GIBBERING ] Jan 's right . There 's something weird about this place . Hey . The more I struggle , the more I get stuck . Now , if I can hit the heat ray . Uh-oh . That 's a mean-Iooking one .

You see him fighting a space ray whose one sting is instant death . - Watch . - I 'm watching . And now the attack of death . [ THUD ] BLACK WIDOW : After capture the champion always destroys his victim . And you are to be next . [ LAUGHING ] Are you sure this is the way they took Space Ghost ? They came this way . Look .

You 're all heart , black Widow . [ BEEPING ] That , Space Ghost , is the alarm . Whoever is attempting your rescue is safely in one of our traps and will follow you into the arena .

Without your power bands , you are no match for my champion . Huh ? Attaboy , BIip . Good work . The power bands are gone . Quick , before he can use them kill . kill . [ GROWLING ] Too late , black Widow . It 's my turn to use force . The force ray . Guards . Guards . And that takes care of you . Use your powers , Space Ghost but we will meet again . Yuck . It sure was sticky getting out of that web . It sure was , and I hope the black Widow is gone for good . Don 't depend on it . SPACE GHOST [ ON MONITOR ] : I have a feeling we 'll meet her again .

METALLUS : My controlled destroyers , and that is dead planet Beta a perfect subject for my demonstration . Watch . Correction , that was dead planet Beta . It no longer exists . Make your point , MetaIIus . What 's on your twisted tin mind ? Look , Space Ghost , this is my super missile . Unless my price is met it will blast off directly at Earth itself within the hour . And your price ? You will surrender to me immediately . Space Ghost , you wouldn 't let that armor-pIated poIecat tell you what to do . I have no choice . release of that missile would be the Earth 's doom . A wise decision , Space Ghost . You will start at once unarmed and without your power bands . My directional beam will bring you to me . I never thought Space Ghost would surrender to MetaIIus . - We 've got to help him . - But how ? No one has ever located MetaIIus ' secret headquarters . JACE : Look . - It 's blip . He must have stowed away on the Phantom Cruiser . - Space Gho- - - hold it . Activate receiver four . JAN : That 's the homing-device channel . - Right . Remember the homing device I attached to blip 's collar ... - ... so we could always find him ? - Hey . This could lead us to MetaIIus ' hidden headquarters .

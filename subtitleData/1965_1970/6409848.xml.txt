 [ theme music plays ] [ woman over intercom ] Dr. Frame ? May I come in for a moment ? Dr. Frame ? [ door opens ] John , are you all right ? Yes , yes , I 'm fine . I must 've been dreaming . What is it ? There 's Detective Inspector Slinn waiting to see you . He phoned several times . I told him you were ... well , busy . But now he 's come round . Well , did he say what he wanted ? [ Helen ] No , except that it was important . - I 'd better see him then . - You 're sure ? I mean ... You 're sure you 're not too tired ? No , Helen . Don 't fuss . I 'll get rid of him quickly . Then we 'll have dinner . - Hmm ? - Well we 'll talk about that later . I 'll send him in . Come in , Inspector . Been trying to get all afternoon , Doctor . [ Frame ] Well I was a little tired . I 've been resting . Superintendent Barry thought you might be of some assistance to us . ln what way ? We 've got a bloke down at the station . We 're charging him with murder . Only snag is we don 't know very much about him . Can 't get any sense out of him at all . He 's either he 's off his head , psychologically speaking ... or he 's the world 's greatest actor . The superintendent thought you might help us to decide which . You sound as if you 've already made up your mind , Inspector . Somebody commits a crime it doesn 't matter to me whether he 's a nut or a genius , or both . My job is to apprehend him and charge him . Right ? Of course , nowadays they are all nuts . But in my book they are still thieves and murderers just the same as they always were . I am surprised you want my help . [ Slinn ] What I want , Doctor , is a conviction . [ Frame ] Yes , I 'm not interested in that , Inspector . - My sole interest is- - - Yes , sir ... I understand your sole interest is clinical . And any opinion you may have will be available for the man 's defence as well . That is quite right , sir . When would you like me to come down to the Yard ? That won 't be necessary , sir . We can bring him here . Save you a bit of trouble , won 't it ? - Yes . But really I- - - No , that 's all right , sir . It 's no trouble to us . We 'll bring him this evening . Thank you , Dr. Frame . Oh , incidentally , this man is a murderer . Tried armed robbery , shot and killed three people . - Is it safe to bring him here ? - Oh , he 's dangerous . But you 'll be all right with us , Doctor . We 'll look after you . [ door opens ] [ door closes ] Anything serious ? [ Frame ] Somebody they 're charging with murder . They want me to examine him . They are bringing him here this evening . - [ Helen ] Here ? - [ Frame ] Yes . That 's funny , it hadn 't struck me . Little odd isn 't it ? Bringing him here , I mean . Anyway , it rather puts paid to our dinner date . [ Helen ] Yes , it does . [ Frame ] Well , doesn 't that upset you ? [ Helen ] Well I hadn 't actually accepted . [ Frame ] But ... Well , it 's Tuesday . We always have dinner on Tuesday . [ Helen ] Yes , every Tuesday . Routine , isn 't that the word , John ? [ Frame ] Helen ! Wednesday , is that routine ? Perhaps I want a little more than a clandestine dinner , once a week . Are you asking me to make a decision ? [ Helen ] I 'll leave that up to you , John . [ Frame ] And Wednesday ? [ Helen ] Perhaps we 'd better get back to things as they used to be . Remember you once asked me never to accept invitations to go out with you ? That ! Oh , that was just a ... typical piece of masculine rationalisation . I was paving the way for rejection before you had a chance to reject me yourself . It 's called preserving the ego . - Helen- - - Oh please , John , no ... - Will you stay on this evening ? - Yes , if you want me to . [ faint , low humming ] John , what 's the matter ? [ Frame ] It 's that noise , I heard it earlier today . - What noise ? - But surely you- - [ Frame ] A kind of humming . Well , maybe it was the lift . These old lifts make strange sounds . [ Helen over intercom ] Dr. Frame ? Inspector Slinn is waiting , Doctor . Show him in , would you . [ door opens ] - Good evening , Doctor . - Good evening , Inspector . [ Slinn ] Right , sit him down there . [ chair scraping ] [ handcuffs clicking ] [ Frame ] Has anybody looked at that cut ? [ Slinn ] It 's only a bruise , Doctor . Our friend gets a little violent . - Must you keep him handcuffed ? - It 's better that way . - Come on you . Wake up- - - Inspector ! If you don 't mind I 'd like to handle this my way . [ Frame ] What 's his name ? [ Slinn ] We 're not very sure . [ Slinn ] You two , sit either side of him . [ policemen sit down ] [ Frame ] Can you hear me ? Doesn 't he call himself anything ? [ Slinn ] Connor 's the name he used . [ Frame ] Connor , can you hear me ? [ Connor panting ] Mr. Connor , do you know where you are ? And do you know who I am ? Well , who am I ? [ Connor ] Don 't you know ? [ Frame ] Yes , I know ... but do you ? [ Connor ] Look , John , what happened ? Why did you tie me up like this ? You 're not tied up . You 're handcuffed . I 'll tell you why in a minute . How do you know my name is John ? Oh , for Pete 's sake , old boy ! You 're John . You 're the John I did my training with , shared my quarters with . Don 't you want me to call you John ? I mean , do you want to be addressed by rank ? Very well , sir . Permission to speak , sir . May I say something about our present position , Commander Leason ? [ Slinn ] Cut that out , whatever your name is ! [ Frame ] Inspector , do you mind ... [ Frame walks across room ] [ Frame picks up chair ] [ Frame ] What was that name you just called me ? [ Connor ] It 's your name : Leason . Shouldn 't I call you that anymore ? [ Frame ] I don 't really mind , except that my name is Frame . - Do you understand ? Frame . - Look , John ... [ Connor ] All right , so your name 's Frame . [ Frame ] And you believe your name is Connor ? [ Connor ] Correction : I know my name is Connor . That is a lot of nonsense . [ Frame ] What do you mean ? [ Slinn ] Gives his name as Wilfred Connor , born Hastings , Sussex . And you know the date he gives ? October the 7th , 1969 . 1969 ! Is that correct , Mr. Connor ? [ Connor ] Is what correct ? [ Frame ] Do you believe you were born in 1969 ? I think my mother would confirm it . [ Frame ] Do you know what today 's date is ? [ Connor ] June the 3rd or 4th . I 'm not sure . - And the year ? - 1996 . [ Frame ] The year is 1969 . This is 1969 . This is the year in which you claim to have been born . [ Connor ] You really are gone , aren 't you old boy ? [ Frame ] Look , Connor , if I show you a calendar or a newspaper which clearly shows today 's date is June the 4th , 1969 ... - ... will you believe me then ? - No ! Why not ? Because this job we 're doing is difficult enough and sometimes everybody doubts his or her reason . The pressure 's on all the time so you have to cling to certain unalterable things . Like your name , the date , the names of friends ... Now , I know what year it is . Do you understand that ? I know ! [ Slinn ] He was like this at the Yard . [ Frame ] If I persist in telling you that this is 1969 , what will you deduce from that ? - That you 're sick . - Mad ? [ Connor ] I said sick ... Temporary madness if you like but we were trained to recognise the symptoms and take precautions . Now come on , untie me . Let 's try and talk the thing out . [ Frame ] You 're not tied up . You 're handcuffed . You 're under arrest . Do you appreciate that ? [ Connor ] Arrest ? How can I be under arrest ? [ Frame ] According to the police you shot and killed three people whilst attempting a robbery . [ Connor ] John ! You don 't really believe that . [ Frame ] I am only telling you what the police said . [ Connor ] They weren 't people , John . Don 't you remember ? They weren 't people . [ Frame ] What were they then ? [ Connor ] You know as well as I do . They were space creatures . Venusian space creatures . [ Frame ] That 's what you shot ? Three space creatures ? - From Venus ? - That 's right . [ Frame ] Did the police doctors do any medical tests on this man ? [ Slinn ] Quite a few . Why sir ? [ Frame ] This kind of hallucination could be compatible with drug taking or possibly severe alcoholism ... [ Slinn ] The tests didn 't show anything like that . [ Frame ] He told you the same story when he was arrested ? [ Slinn ] Yes . Said he 'd killed three space creatures . Connor , what were they like these space creatures ? [ Connor ] You saw them yourself . [ Slinn ] I know ... I 've forgotten what they look like ... - ... can you remember ? - I can remember all right ! [ Frame ] Tell me about them . [ Connor ] Of course , you never really believed in them , did you ? But I knew . Remember , John ? We had a row about it . I 'd said something about there being wild life all over the Earth and in the sea . So why not in space ? " Oh no , " you said , " quite impossible . " How could you be so sure ? That 's what got me . Why shouldn 't there be some kind of creature that the scientists hadn 't even dreamed about ? Well , we know now , don 't we ? I nearly spewed up when I saw them . Not with fright ... Well , not just fright ... but just the way they looked . - What did they look like ? - Like lizards ... When you actually see them . Almost transparent . Outside we couldn 't see them . Then suddenly they were in the ship and we saw them forming before us . Seems it takes them a second or two to adapt . I grabbed the electron-gun , sprayed them twice . Then we heaved them into the airlock vault and jettisoned them into space again . [ Frame ] And that 's what happened to you ? [ Connor ] Don 't you remember ? You saw them yourself . You were sitting just over there at the control panel . [ Frame ] You think we 're still in a space ship ? [ Connor ] We are , John ! We are ! Look out of the port , tell me what you see . Space . The Earth a pinpoint in the distance . Go on , look ! [ Frame 's footsteps ] - [ Frame ] This is the port ? - [ Connor ] Of course it is ! [ Connor ] Look out . [ footsteps ] Now ... tell me what you see . ln the sky , stars . Down in the street , a few people , cars . There 's a bus just going by . I can 't see where it 's going though . We don 't have buses any more , John ! You 're remembering the past . A double-decker bus is a pretty tangible thing . It 's not an object to weave a fantasy around . [ Connor ] But that 's just what you 're doing . [ Frame ] How many of us are in this spaceship of yours ? [ Connor ] Just the two of us . - You should know that . - And what about the Inspector ? [ Frame ] Detective Inspector Slinn . The man who brought you here . And his two assistants . There 's no-one else here . Just you and me . [ Frame ] But you 've been talking to them ! [ Connor ] Correction , John : You 've been talking to them , not me . Yes , all right , I 've been talking to them . But you must be able to see them . Inspector , would you mind standing in front of Connor just for a moment ? [ Frame ] Now , the inspector 's standing directly in front of you . He 's obscuring me from your view . - Can you see him now ? - No . - [ Frame ] You 're quite certain ? - [ Connor ] Positive . [ Slinn ] You don 't believe all this bull , do you ? He can 't see me ? ! Right . [ Slinn slaps Connor ] - [ Frame ] Inspector ! - [ Slinn ] Ask if he felt that . [ Frame ] I must insist I conduct this interview in my own way . I strongly disapprove of violence being used- - [ Slinn ] All right , but ask him if he felt it . Connor ? Did you feel anything just now ? [ Connor ] What do you mean ? [ Frame ] Inspector Slinn just struck you with his hand . Across the cheek . Did you feel anything ? No-one struck me . [ Frame ] Do you still believe he is acting ? [ Slinn ] He saw me all right when we arrested him . He drew a gun on us . What was he going to shoot , a figment of his imagination ? [ Frame ] I wish I had your confidence , Inspector . Your certainty . Because as far as I 'm concerned , this man is telling the truth . At least the truth as he sees it . So you think he 's completely barmy ? At the moment he 's deranged , he 's suffering from an hallucination , a fantasy . And when is he going to snap out of it ? [ Frame ] Maybe never . [ Slinn ] Look , Doctor I want a statement . I need a statement . Can 't you get him to talk sense for a few minutes ? He can 't always have been like this . Well we can try . But at the moment he rejects all reality . What I 'm hoping to do is establish some common ground with him . Some knowledge that we can both share . Like ... Well , let 's try . [ Frame ] Connor , we 're going to play a little game . We 're going to try and get back to reality . [ Connor ] My reality or yours ? [ Frame ] Ours . Now if I mention a date , say 1066 , what does that mean to you ? Battle of Hastings . Norman Conquest . - [ Connor ] What does it mean to you ? - [ Frame ] Exactly the same . [ Connor ] Good . Then we 're making progress . [ Frame ] Thank you . I was about to say the same thing . [ Frame ] Now , I 'm holding something in my hand . What is it ? - [ Connor ] A book . - [ Frame ] Good . And this ? - [ Connor ] Pen . - [ Frame ] Correct . [ Frame ] I put the pen down . What do I put it on ? The chart table . Do you think this is a chart table ? [ Connor ] Well , what do you think it is ? [ Frame ] It 's a desk . It 's a fairly ordinary desk . There 's a blotter on it , a telephone , an intercom with the reception room ... - [ Frame ] A few papers , a letter- - - [ Connor ] It 's a chart table ! It 's made of plastic and light metal . ln front of you are our navigational maps and operational orders . On the left is a radio . Well , why don 't you call Base ? Switch the radio on and call Base . If I switch this on , I get through to my receptionist . - You saw her as you came in . - I didn 't . Come now , Connor , you could hardly miss her . She 's a very attractive young woman . Is her name Helen ? How did you know that ? So Helen 's on board ! Helen Carter . How did you know her name ? You must have heard me speak to her when you came in . [ Connor ] You didn 't speak to her . [ Frame ] Then how did you know ? How ? She lives near the park , doesn 't she ? I remember the music from the bandstand . - [ Frame ] Well as a matter of fact- - - [ Connor ] Don 't you remember ? I drove you there once in my car . You kept talking about your wife ... Wondering if you were doing the right thing . Then you were going to give her up . Don 't you remember ? You 've talked about it so many times . Try to remember . She 's real . The only real thing in this dream world of yours . Doesn 't that prove something ? I know about Helen . And Carol . I know about Carol too . - Who is Carol ? - Well , your wife , for Pete 's sake ... - ... Carol 's your wife . - Well , no , you 're quite wrong . Then what 's your wife 's name ? ! What 's her name ? [ Frame ] It 's , er ... [ struggles , hesitates ] You don 't know ! You don 't know ! [ tape player clicking ] [ Frame ] Inspector I don 't see much point in continuing this . [ Slinn ] Right , Doctor . I 'll take him away . You manage to get anything ? Oh , yes , quite definite progress . This case interests me . Connor has a strong personality . I think we might see a great improvement tomorrow . - [ Slinn ] In the morning ? - [ Frame ] Yes , morning will be fine . Good night , Inspector . [ Slinn ] Good night , Doctor . [ pours whisky ] - [ Helen ] All finished ? - [ Frame ] Oh , yes . [ Helen ] John ... what 's the matter ? Nothing , nothing ... [ Helen ] You seem so upset . [ Frame ] A madman comes into my office . A stark raving madman . Do you know what he tells me ? He tells me your name and address . But how on earth did he know ? [ Frame ] You 've never seen him before ? - [ Helen ] No , never . - [ Frame ] How did he know ? You know , that man intrigued me ... He intrigued and frightened me . He actually frightened me for a moment . Did he seem to recognise you when he came in ? No , I don 't even think he saw me . [ Frame sighs ] No dinner , Helen . Let 's have a drink . Shall we ? [ Helen ] Oh , your wife rang and wants you to ring her ... - You better do it . - My wife ? Didn 't you want her to know you were at the office ? [ Frame ] What did she say ? [ Helen ] Nothing much . I said you were busy . And she said , " Well , tell him Carol rang " . Her name is Carol . Carol . [ Connor 's voice on recorder ] Doesn 't that prove something ? I know about Helen . And Carol . I know about Carol too . - [ Frame ] Who 's Carol ? - Well , your wife for Pete 's sake ... - ... Carol 's your wife . - Well , no , you 're quite- - John , you 're here early . Yes , I wanted to listen to that tape again . - You still worried about it ? - I 'm intrigued . And surprised when a complete stranger ... Helen , are you are sure you 've never met him before ? [ Helen ] Yes , positive . [ Frame ] Then how ? How ? Slinn ! I wonder if Inspector Slinn has anything to do with it . - But why should he ? - I don 't know why , but Slinn Slinn 's a very odd character . I don 't know that I like him much . I don 't even know that I believe him . When he says he 's a detective , why should I believe him ? [ Helen ] But John that 's ... well , it 's absurd . The man said he was a detective . [ Frame ] And that proves is , does it ? We have people coming in here saying they 're Napoleon . Anybody ... Now why not a detective ? [ Helen ] But he showed me his warrant card . Did he ? He didn 't show it to me . [ Helen ] I don 't suppose he thought it was necessary . [ Frame ] Of course not ! I 'm only the Doctor . And yet he did find it necessary to show it to you . And how do I know you really saw it ? You seem to figure in this thing in the most remarkable way . Connor mentions your name , he tells me where you live and now you vouch for Slinn . Just what is your interest in all this , Helen ? What is it ? I don 't suppose I have to tell you Scotland Yard 's telephone number ? [ dials telephone ] I 'm sorry , Helen . I 'm sorry . I 'm so on edge about all this . Well , perhaps , this will clear it up . Superintendent Barry , please . [ to Helen ] What do you think he 'll tell me ? That Slinn doesn 't exist ? Superintendent Barry ? Oh , good morning , Tom . This is John Frame here . I 'm very well thank you . Tom , about this Inspector Slinn and the man you sent with him . [ Frame ] Yes . Yes , I see . No , no trouble . Not at all . Oh , yes , I think we 'll get somewhere . I 'm only too pleased to help . Yes , of course . Thank you , Tom . Goodbye . [ puts receiver down ] [ sighs ] Well Slinn , it appears , is a first class officer . Superintendent Barry is sorry he didn 't give me more warning . But he thought it would be less of an imposition to send the prisoner to see me than have me go to the Yard . - But that doesn 't help us , does it ? - No . Perhaps Connor 's ... Well , is there such a thing as telepathic thought ? - [ Helen ] Well , is it possible ? - [ Frame ] Not to that extent . I mean a certain amount of telepathy exists but it 's usually on a primitive level . Connor was too precise . He was too thoroughly sure of himself . And that 's another odd thing about him . His confidence . No wonder Slinn gets annoyed with him . Authority can 't bear the man with a mind of his own . Even if the mind 's deranged . Look , maybe Slinn is right . Perhaps Connor is perfectly normal and acting a part . - [ Frame ] That still doesn 't explain it . - [ Helen ] But John , a sane man ... a really calculating man , couldn 't he have made enquiries found out about us ... - ... just to try and confuse you ? - But how and when ? I mean , that presupposes that Connor knew he was going to be caught . And also that he knew I would be called to examine him . I just can 't believe he 's shamming . [ Slinn ] Well , I can . Good morning , Doctor . The door was open . [ Frame ] Morning , Inspector . - [ Slinn ] Should I bring him in ? - [ Frame ] Yes , all right . [ Frame ] Have you noticed any change in him ? [ Slinn ] You think he 's mad , don 't you ? I mean , clean off his rocker . [ Frame ] Well , that might be a legitimate interpretation for a layman . [ Slinn ] Right , Doctor . Have a look at that . [ opens paper document ] [ Frame ] Well ? - [ Slinn ] You know what it is ? - [ Frame ] A confession , I assume . [ Slinn ] That might be a legitimate interpretation for a layman , yes . We in the police , on the other hand , designate it in a somewhat different manner . This is what we refer to as a statement by the accused . I have been endeavouring to get our friend here to sign this statement . Now if he 's really mad he 'd sign it , shouldn 't he ? [ Frame ] I think you 're confusing things a little , Inspector . If he were sign this it would prove that he 's stupid , not mad . [ Slinn ] How do you mean ? [ Frame ] I mean that stupidity , dullness , even idiocy are not necessarily the same thing as madness . This man , Connor , is reasonably intelligent . He 's probably above the average . He doesn 't believe he committed the crimes that are mentioned . So , obviously , he 's not going to sign this ' statement as you call it . [ Slinn ] I don 't think you quite understand what I am getting at . [ Frame ] No , I don 't think I do . [ Slinn ] Well , if he 's not mad enough to sign something that he knows will land him in trouble . To my way of thinking that proves he 's sane . - [ Frame ] It does ? - [ Slinn ] Definitely . [ Frame ] My dear Inspector , would you sign this document ? - [ Slinn ] Of course , I wouldn 't . - [ Frame ] Why not ? [ Slinn ] For a start , I haven 't committed the crimes listed- - [ Frame ] Then surely you can understand that Connor refuses to sign for the same reason . He doesn 't believe he committed the crimes that are mentioned . [ Slinn ] Because he 's putting on this insanity caper . He was all right when he left here last night . I had quite a reasonable chat with him . - [ Frame ] He talked quite rationally ? - [ Slinn ] Oh , yes . Yes . Not about the case , mind you . He shut up quick when we got around to that . The rest of the time he was fairly normal . [ Frame ] Good . Then we did get some results yesterday . [ Slinn ] Doctor , the only result I am interested in today [ slaps statement ] is this . [ Frame ] I 'm afraid that 's your concern , Inspector . I haven 't been retained by the prosecution . [ Frame ] Connor . Come along now , wake up . Wake up there 's a good chap . [ Connor ] How are you feeling ? [ Frame ] I 'm very well . What about you ? [ Connor ] I thought for a moment you might have recovered . [ Frame ] Strangely enough I was entertaining a similar hope about you . Are you going to untie me now ? [ Frame ] Untie ? [ Connor ] I forgot , I 'm handcuffed . Well , are you going to take the handcuffs off ? I am afraid that 's nothing to do with me . But I am pleased to hear you agree you 're wearing handcuffs . Look , John , if it makes you feel any happier I 'll wear a ball and chain . Anything you like . [ Frame ] And you will agree that you are in my consulting room and not in a spaceship ? [ Connor ] If that 's what you want , then I am in your consulting room . And you remember killing three people ? Yes , if it makes you feel any happier then- - Just a minute ! What happens to me if I admit killing three people ? Well I imagine you 'll go for trial . - [ Connor ] And be found guilty ? - [ Frame ] If there 's enough evidence . [ Connor ] And then what ? - [ Frame ] Then you 'll be sentenced . - [ Connor ] Sentenced to what ? [ Frame ] Well , whatever the judge decides . I 've no idea . [ Connor ] Not much you haven 't . I 'll be sentenced to death . Next you 'll wake up thinking you 're the public hangman and you 'll want to carry out the sentence . Well , I take back everything I said . I 'm not handcuffed , I 'm tied up . I 'm not in your consulting room I 'm in space craft P for Piper . I 'm 137 485 Flight Lieutenant Connor , Wilfred . Number Three Space Squadron , Royal Air Force . The year is 1996 . I know who I am , what I am and where I am . That 's my lifeline . And you can 't destroy it , John . - You can 't destroy it . - Now calm down , Connor . I am not going to harm you . I 'm not a policeman . I 'm a doctor . You 're ill and I want to help you make yourself well again . Now , yesterday I thought we got along fine . We made real progress . Didn 't you find our talk yesterday ... interesting ? [ flatly ] Yes , fascinating . [ Frame ] We agreed on certain things , remember ? [ Connor ] I remember . [ Frame ] Well now , today I want to continue ... - our little game . - It won 't work . - Well , let 's give it a try . - No ! I was trying to humour you yesterday . But that must be the wrong approach . Today I stick to things as they are . - [ Slinn ] You see ? - [ Frame ] See what , Inspector ? [ Slinn ] The moment the pressure goes on he starts acting mad again . [ Frame ] Connor ! Don 't go to sleep again . You must be very tired . Didn 't you have a good sleep last night ? Of course , I didn 't ! How could I with you pacing up and down half the time ? ! - [ Frame ] Me ? - [ Connor ] Yes , you ! When you weren 't prowling around you were muttering in your sleep . The state you were in , I didn 't dare go to sleep . I can assure- - I spent a very comfortable night at home . [ Connor ] With your wife ? [ Frame ] Yes ... with my wife . [ Connor ] That surprised you , didn 't it ? I mean , yesterday when I talked about your wife and Helen . That shocked you , didn 't it ? [ Frame ] Shock is a rather strong word . [ Connor ] You were shocked all right . For a moment , I thought I had really got through to you . Well ... I will admit that for a moment I was let 's say , surprised . Good . I mean , you might even grant that I know more about you than you do about me . - I wouldn 't say that , Connor . - No ? Well , do you know my wife 's name ? I , er ... No ... I don 't . [ Connor ] Well there you are then . Now , listen carefully . You seem a bit better today , much calmer . I think if you 'd just take a pill , you 'd be all right . What kind of pill did you have in mind ? A yellow pill . There 's a bottle of them in the second drawer of the chart table . Oh , we 're back on that now , are we ? All right , all right , the second drawer of your desk . The bottle 's in there . Take one . Do you understand ? What are they called , these pills ? Everybody calls them ' Yellows' or Formula 73 . - Does that mean anything to you ? - Yes , of course it does . They 've proved very successful in treating certain kinds of mental illness . How do you know about them ? I know . That 's all that matters . Have you ever had one of these pills ? [ Connor ] No , never needed one . [ Frame ] Inspector , I take it you 've checked with all the mental hospitals ? [ Slinn ] Been no escapes , if that 's what you mean . [ Frame ] No staff reported missing or anything ? [ Slinn ] Not to my knowledge . What 's all this about this yellow pill ? It 's very funny actually . If our friend here was right . If , in fact , we were living in a time when long journeys through space were possible . Well , temporary hallucinations brought about by prolonged spells of weightlessness would be an obvious hazard . A kind of space hysteria . And this pill he mentioned Formula 73 , or something very like it that would be precisely the kind of antidote to use . He couldn 't be a doctor , could he ? [ Frame ] Why don 't you ask him ? Hey , Connor , or whatever you call yourself ... Are you a doctor ? Connor ! I am talking to you ... [ Frame ] Why don 't you answer the inspector ? - [ Connor ] What ? - [ Frame ] The inspector just asked you a question . Why don 't you answer him ? [ Connor ] Because I can 't see him and I can 't hear him . I deduce from that that he doesn 't exist except in your mind . His name 's Slinn , isn 't it ? [ Frame ] If you think he 's not there , how do you know that ? [ Connor ] You told me yesterday . Bit pompous , isn 't he ? That 's the one reassuring thing about this fantasy world of yours , John . All the people in it are real people . Take old Slinn , for instance . You remember Warrant Officer Slinn ? king of the space-age square bashers . Used to take us for drill . I remember you saying at the time : " How the devil do you stand to attention in a state of weightlessness ? " Not a bad thought that ... Old Slinn as a police officer . [ Connor mimicking Slinn ] " l apprehended the offender when I observed him committing the above mentioned offence . " [ Frame laughing ] [ Slinn ] What 's so funny ? [ Frame ] I 'm sorry , Inspector . I could actually hear you saying that yourself . [ Connor ] Something tells you I am right , doesn 't it ? You remember Slinn now , don 't you ? [ Frame chuckles ] No , I 'm sorry , Connor . [ Frame ] I met Inspector Slinn for the first time yesterday . [ Connor ] Take one of those pills and see if you still say that . [ Frame ] Connor , for the last time there are no yellow pills in this room . [ Connor ] Look in the drawer . Look in the drawer , go on . [ Frame ] If I look in the drawer , you 'll be satisfied ? [ Connor ] Go on , look in it . [ Frame ] Very well . [ rattling ] [ Connor ] I told you they were there . [ Frame ] There must be some- - Now take one , just one . And everything will change . You will be back to normal in a matter of minutes . [ Frame ] I didn 't put those pills in that drawer . [ Connor ] It doesn 't matter who put them there . But they are there , that 's indisputable . So take one . Go on . Take one . [ Frame storms out of the room ] - [ Helen ] What 's the matter ? - [ Frame ] Have you seen those before ? - [ Helen ] No , I ... - [ Frame ] You didn 't put them in my desk ? - [ Helen ] Of course I didn 't . - [ Frame ] Then how did they get there ? - [ Helen ] How on earth should I know ? - [ Frame ] Now listen , Helen this is serious . Connor just told me to look in the desk . He knew those pills were going to be in there . Now , there 's only one other person who could have put them there , apart from myself . - [ Helen ] And that 's me ? - [ Frame ] Yes ! Well , who else could it have been ? And just why would I want to do something like that ? - You could have your reasons . - Such as ? Well , to say the least , you 're acting - rather strangely today . - I 'm acting strangely ? ! Oh , yes . All this business about not wanting to go out to dinner with me ... About wanting something more than clandestine dinners ... - You did say that didn 't you ? - I think I 'd better go home . Helen , Helen , I 'm sorry ... I don 't know what I am saying half the time . That maniac ... He 's beginning to make me doubt my own sanity . Do you think that could happen ? Could a maniac drive a perfectly sane man right off his head ? No , of course he couldn 't ! [ Frame ] No , no . You 're wrong , Helen . You 're wrong . Say ... Say you were in a house , all alone and suddenly somebody appears . Now , whoever it is , he doesn 't threaten you or frighten you . He just insists that he doesn 't exist . He tells you he 's an hallucination with a reality only in your own mind . And then he disappears . And the next day , what do you think ? What do you believe ? There 's no evidence either for or against that person 's existence . You wouldn 't know what to believe . Is this room real ? Is there really a maniac next door ? And you , Helen ... Do you really exist ? [ Frame 's voice , echoing ] Are you really there , Helen ? Are you really there ? - [ Helen ] How are you feeling now ? - [ Frame ] I 'm better , thanks . That was stupid of me . I 'm sorry . [ Helen ] Look , they 're still waiting . Shall I tell them to go ? [ Frame ] No , of course not . Don 't you think it would be wiser ? - [ Frame ] No . - [ Helen ] John , what is it ? I was just wondering what would happen if I took one ? What would vanish ? And what would remain ? Nothing would change and you know it ! - [ Frame ] Do I ? - [ Helen ] John , please don 't . Why are you frightened ? [ Helen ] I don 't know . What happens if a perfectly normal person takes one ? [ Frame ] Find out . He gets a headache . And he can 't work . You see , to a certain extent we all live in a world of symbols and illusions . Imagination , if you like . Now in the schizophrenic , this imagination is heightened . It 's uncontrolled to the point of fantasy . This pill depresses the power of the imagination . So if the schizophrenic takes one he comes back to the real world . But if a normal person takes one he finds himself looking at life as it really is . The essence of things . For the very first time . A face becomes a geometrical pattern . You can scarcely bear to hear people talk because you realise that , most of the time they 're not saying anything . I took one once , a couple of years ago , as an experiment . I couldn 't work for a week . We enjoy our illusions , you see . The simple man and the sophisticated man . Take away his illusions and you take away most of his life . - [ Helen ] Don 't see Connor again ! - [ Frame ] So you 're worried now . [ Helen ] I just don 't want you to take one of those pills ! [ Frame ] Well , of course you don 't . Because you 're just a symbol . My wife and I quarrel and Helen becomes the embodiment of everything that 's tolerant and understanding , glamorous and intelligent . Every man has a Helen in his dream world . And every Helen wants to preserve the man 's image of herself . [ Helen ] I think you 're being insulting . [ Frame ] How can I insult something that doesn 't exist ? If I take one of these I won 't even see you . You 're just a symbol , a fantasy . You don 't exist , Helen . You don 't exist ! [ Helen walks away ] [ door slams ] [ Frame walks back to his desk ] Did you take the pill , John ? [ Frame ] If you don 't mind I 'd prefer you address me as Doctor . [ Connor ] All right . Did you take the pill , Doctor ? Certainly not . But it might be an idea to give you one . No . I don 't need one . We 'll be re-entering Earth 's atmosphere quite soon now . One of us has got to be fully fit to handle the ship . If you pers- - If you persist in this kind of talk , Connor , I 'll have no option but to give you a pill . No , honestly , I don 't need one . [ Frame ] But you still think we 're in a spaceship ? [ Connor ] That 's right . I thought you were coming round to my way of thinking . [ Frame ] Did you ? Well , you listen to me , Connor . You think you 're being very smart , don 't you ? You think you 're confusing a lot of people , but not me . I know . You understand ? I know . The Inspector was perfectly right . You 're bluffing . But this little yellow pill is going to call your bluff . - [ Connor ] What do you mean ? - [ Frame ] Take it ! [ Connor ] No . [ Frame ] You 're frightened , aren 't you ? Take it ! - [ Connor ] You can 't force me to ! - [ Frame ] I don 't need to ... I don 't need to . You 're frightened and that 's your first real admission . Because this little pill can explode your dream world . It 's not a dream . I 'm in a spaceship . You 're in my office ! [ shouting ] Desk ! Chair ! Detective ! Office ! Office ! Now don 't mess me about any more , Connor . You 've annoyed me . You 've tried to fool me . I can write anything I like in my report . Do you understand that ? I can write enough to hang you . So come on , Connor . The truth . - [ Connor ] But I keep telling you- - - [ Frame ] The truth ! [ Connor ] Stop it , you 're confusing me . I didn 't sleep very much . You can sleep all you want when we 're finished . Come on , Connor ... Think . Remember . Perhaps you didn 't mean it . We can all understand that . [ Connor ] Look , Doctor , I 'm tired . You 're so sure . [ Frame ] Of course I am . You keep giving yourself away . Just now ... do you know what you called me ? You called me " Doctor " . Now I didn 't ask you to . You just said it . But how could I have done all these things ? Murder ? I 'm not a violent man . Of course you 're not ... Not now . But it 's in all of us , Connor . That moment when we can 't argue any more . When the only way we can make our point is with a fist or with a gun . Be reasonable , Connor . It happens to all of us individually , collectively . War . Isn 't that the kind of madness we all disclaim responsibility for ? You 're not unique , Connor . You waged your own private war for half an hour . But it 's over now . And the best thing to do is tell me about it . I 'm not saying I couldn 't have killed anyone . [ softly ] Is that what I did ? [ Frame ] Three people , Connor . [ Connor ] I don 't remember . Do you suppose it was blackout or something like that ? Of course it was . [ Connor ] I can 't explain it . [ Frame ] But you know where you are now ? Well , it 's your office isn 't it , Doctor ? That 's right. you 're not in a spaceship any more . Spaceship ? Is that what I said ? That 's funny ... I can remember telling you something about a spaceship . [ Frame ] And you said you didn 't kill three people just three space creatures . [ Connor ] Space creatures ! What the devil are space creatures ? Well , that 's what you said . Space creatures ! That 's ridiculous . Space creatures ! [ laughs uncontrollably ] Connor ! Connor ! [ stems laughter ] I must be rather a violent man , wouldn 't you say so , Doctor ? I mean , aren 't you a bit frightened having a murderer in your consulting room ? - No . - I might try to attack you . [ Frame ] I don 't think you wouldn 't do that . [ Connor ] No ? Well what do you think I should do then ? [ Frame ] I think the best thing would be for you to make a very full statement to the Inspector . Just tell him what happened , how you felt . [ Connor ] Wouldn 't it be better if I just pretended to be mad ? - [ Frame ] You are- - - [ Connor ] Go on say it . You think I am mad don 't you ? [ Frame ] I told you before , you 're ill . You 've had a mental breakdown . At your trial your defence will plead insanity . You won 't go to prison if that 's what you 're worried about . No I 'll get locked up in a stinking nut house , full of blokes who think they 're Napoleon . Well , it won 't work , Doctor . I 've killed and I 'll kill again . I won 't be locked up . Doesn 't that frighten you ? There are three policemen here , Connor . They can handle you . And you 're handcuffed . Quite securely . Ha ! Securely you said . Now what about that , Doctor ? Not so safe now , are you ? [ Frame ] You 're being very stupid , Connor . [ Connor ] But you 're scared just the same . I don 't need a gun to kill people . [ Frame ] All right , Connor ... Now let go . You 'll only make things worse for yourself . Connor ! [ Frame ] Inspector ! Give me a hand , will you ! Will you two help me ? Can 't you see he 's attacking me ? ! [ Connor ] See , you 're not so safe after all . You 're not so safe , are you ? You 're not so safe , after all ! You 're not so safe ! [ struggling , gasping ] [ Connor choking , groaning ] [ gasping ] [ Frame ] Connor ? Connor ? Connor ! Oh , no , I didn 't mean to ... Inspector , You saw what was happening . Why didn 't you help me ? I didn 't mean ... Inspector ! Well you two , why did you just stand there ? ! You saw what he was trying to do . Slinn ... answer me . [ sobbing ] Why don 't you say something ? Oh , I see . [ sobbing ] You were all in on it . All four of you . I should have guessed that . It was me you were really after , all the time . It was me . You didn 't know ... that I ... Connor ... [ sobbing continues ] Inspector ... Helen ! Helen , help me . Helen ... Where are you ? Help me ! Helen ... Will you ... come in here ... please ? [ faint whirring ] [ man over radio ] Venus 347 . P for Piper . Are you receiving our signal ? You are due to re-enter atmosphere in one hour 's time . Repeat ... P for Piper . Hello . Hello , Base . P for Piper answering . P for Piper answering . I am receiving your message . [ man over radio ] What 's been happening up there ? We 've been calling for five hours . I ... Wait ... Hello , Base . - We 've had a bit of trouble . - [ Base ] What kind of trouble ? We were attacked by space creatures . I don 't remember it very clearly but Connor went berserk . He tried to attack me . It was an accident you understand but ... [ Base ] What happened then ? Connor 's dead . [ Base ] That 's hard luck , old man . You all right ? Yes ... yes , I 'm fine . Went mad you said ? I ... Something like that . I must have passed out . I don 't remember much . Didn 't he take his yellow pill ? What ? I asked if Connor took his yellow pill . No he wouldn 't take one . I tried to get him to , but he wouldn 't . That must have been the trouble . Yes , it must have been . Bad show . Nice bloke , young Connor . Yes , he was . A nice bloke .

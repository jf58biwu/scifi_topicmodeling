 ( singing ethereal song ) ( trumpet fanfare ) BROTHER AVERY : Yes ! Oh , yes ! ( trumpet fanfare ) Oh , yes . Look up . Raise your eyes . Cast off the earthly dirt from your feet . Lift up your eyes to the everlasting light ... AUDIENCE : Amen ! ... to the source of all understanding , of all wisdom , of faith , of love . AUDIENCE : Amen ! The light without darkness , life without death . To the sacred fount of the spirit of man and being . To the kingdom itself . To the host . AUDIENCE : Amen ! The coming host of angels . AUDIENCE ( muted ) : Amen ! BROTHER AVERY : A million strong . AUDIENCE : Amen ! The host , the heavenly messengers , the radiant messengers who shall relieve all our suffering . AUDIENCE : Amen ! Oh , my brethren , prepare . Prepare to receive this host . AUDIENCE : Amen ! This multitude of saints who love you . AUDIENCE : Amen ! Prepare for the peace they bring , for they will come . I have seen this multitude with my own eyes . They have spoken to me . AUDIENCE : Amen ! I am chosen . AUDIENCE : Amen ! I am the call of their trumpet . I am their prophet . I bring you proof . I speak in the name of this heavenly host . AUDIENCE : Amen ! NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here , that they 've taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Pat Hingle ... Zina Bethune ... Roger Perry . NARRATOR : David Vincent has seen the prophet , a saintly figure who announces the coming of a heavenly host whose skin begins to glow at the climax of each service . Evidence that Brother Avery is an alien invader and reason for Vincent to contact columnist Bill Shay ... ( phone ringing ) ... of Now magazine . Hello . ( chuckles ) Yes , ma 'am , it certainly is Bill Shay of Now magazine . How are you , sweetheart ? ( doorbell buzzes ) What 's on your mind ? Come in . All right , all right , put him on . Come in . Yeah , Jeff ? I know , I know . You don 't believe it , I don 't believe it . Nobody who reads it will believe it , but that 's what I saw . No , no , no . The prophet was glowing , not me . I 'm a man of rare abstinence , as you well know . Well , here tonight . Tomorrow , Santa Barbara and the great city Thursday . By that time , I will be glowing . Right . Well , I was thinking of a style slightly ironic . Okay . Yeah , and a good , good morning to you . Yes , sir ? My name is David Vincent . I wrote a letter to you some time ago- - no answer . Vincent ... Yeah , the bell rings . You know , there 's a line from an old show that stays with me- - Ray Bolger musical , Charlie 's Aunt . Hmm , yeah . " From Brazil where the nuts come from . " ( chuckling ) : Yeah . I think I 'm going to like you , Mr. Vincent . Thank you . I could use it . What do you call them ? Um , aliens , is that it ? Aliens . Anything you want to call them . And you 've seen them ? Well , as you said on the phone- - you don 't believe it , nobody believes it , but I have seen them . What do they look like ? You ... or me or anybody else . They , uh , well , some of them have a mutated fourth finger . They don 't bleed when they 're cut . They don 't bleed ? That 's passing strange , isn 't it ? In your slightly ironic style . ( chuckles ) You want some coffee ? No , thanks . When they die , they glow . Mm-hmm . They glow with an incandescent light . Bell ring ? Uh ... This man doesn 't die . But they have regenerating tubes . If they 're put into these tubes immediately , two or three minutes before , they do recover . Recharge the old batteries ? Right . " Passing strange . " ( chuckles ) : You said it . You 're standing on the edge of the greatest story a writer could want . Yeah . ( clears throat ) Now , what were these aliens ... Well , you see , you 've got me doing it now . What are these space people of yours doing with the prophet idea ? Where does that fit ? Well , you heard the man- - " Prepare for the coming of a million saints . " You 're talking about a mass landing ? An invasion ? That 's what the man 's advertising . Brother Vincent , you have a serpent 's tongue . You 're right . It is one great story . Even if there 's not a word of truth to it . But what do I hang it on ? Can you give me something ? What if I get pictures of the inside of that van ? The regenerating tubes . Pictures ? Oh-oh , yes , pictures would be just fine . Dad , you got yourself a deal . Brother John . You were right . David Vincent ... he has a fairly comprehensive idea . BROTHER JOHN : I see . Yes , of course . Very well . But we want young people . That 's important to us- - very important . And I want you to impress that upon your friends . Why , we could fill this auditorium many times over , but ... but we want youth , too . CLAIR : Now , you 're the captains , and we 're depending upon you . In a few months , we hope to have a giant youth rally here . Thank you , girls . Bless you . Sister Clair ? Good morning . Good morning . They told me you were the one to see . My name is Dennis Victor . Yes , Mr. Victor ? DAVID : Uh , last night , I saw the revelation . I don 't know how to say this . You were spiritually moved . Yes . Bless you , Mr. Victor . I want to join you . If you 'll just fill out this card . I imagine you 'll want to be with the local chapter . No , no . I ... I 'd like to be a member of the organization . I 'd like to go along with you as a working member . Oh , no , we can 't . Well , we 'd be swamped . Please , Sister , don 't shut me out . Do you know ... or have you ever known how desperately someone could need to belong ? The answer is I ... do know . BROTHER JOHN : Sister Clair ? Good morning . Brother John , this is Dennis Victor . How do you do , sir ? Mr. Victor believes he 's had a spiritual call . Can you tell me about it ? CLAIR : He witnessed the revelation last night . It was as if ... I were burning in the same flame along with Brother Avery . As if he gave me part of his own vision . Bless you . Bless you . We were talking about his perhaps coming with us . Oh , as an apprentice . With your approval , of course . I 'm sure we are fortunate that Mr. Victor has been brought to us by his vision . Let us give thanks that he has been led to our embrace . Greetings , Brother Dennis . WOMAN : That 's him . Let them in , please . BROTHER AVERY : My children ... I am come from a sunrise prayer to bless your great valley- - to dedicate your broad fields and bright hills for the coming descent . Are you as troubled as I am , Brother Dennis ? I bring you love and in your faith you bring me ... Haven 't you seen something that 's caused you to doubt ? BROTHER AVERY : And your faith flows around me ... Are you testing me , Brother ? ... and keeps away the pain , lifts me , buoys me , sustains me . I saw it in your face last night- - onstage , when you thought no one was watching you . Bless you , my children . BROTHER AVERY : Bless you . You needn 't say anything now , only let me show you what I 've seen . The first time was accidental . I wasn 't at all sure what I had seen . Since then , on every move , I 've followed his van . The night before last , it happened again . It 's ... it 's just over here . Is this where you saw the spacecraft ? BROTHER JOHN : Yes . And saints don 't come in spacecraft , do they ? ( car engine starts ) ( two gunshots ) ( glass shattering ) Thanks , amigo . Brother Dennis ? Yes . This way , please . ( knocking on door ) Yes ? Brother Dennis , sir . Very well . Brother Dennis . Yes , sir ? Have you been with Brother John ? Yes , I have . He instructed you in our discipline . Partly . We were to continue when he returned . Has he returned ? We haven 't seen him , sir . Did Brother John give you an assignment ? He suggested Sister Clair would see to it . Well , I daresay she will see to you . Welcome , Brother . Call five minutes . BROTHER AVERY : All my dear people , I look into your beautiful faces and I know I am doubly blessed . I am given a sacred mission and I am received into your hearts . I can feel ... yes , I can physically experience the stimulus of your ... love and faith . It flows up from you into my body . And I am humbled before the manifestation of this spiritual truth in man . And in this transport- - this joining together of our beings ... ( door opens ) You 've got to listen to me . I can explain this . Just listen to me . ( groans , glass shattering ) Listen to me ! ( grunts ) Just hold still a minute ! No ! Sister Clair , listen to me ! No ! Bleeding . Well , apparently , I am . I 'm sorry I had to go about this the way I did but under the circumstances , I would have done anything . I 'm an investigator . With a divine call ? I don 't believe in Brother Avery . I believe in something else- - something that might hurt you a great deal . That he 's a charlatan ? Well , I 've heard that far too often , and you happen to be wrong . He 's an agent for a foreign power . Oh , that 's absurd . Is your faith strong enough to help me prove it one way or the other ? Help me prove it . ( door opens ) What is it , Sister ? Has Brother John returned ? No , Sister . We 've started a search for him . All the more reason why we should discuss this matter thoroughly before we make up our mind . I have a great deal to tell you . I have seen this multitude with my own eyes . AUDIENCE : Amen ! They ... have spoken to me . AUDIENCE : Amen ! I am chosen ! REPORTER : Hey , Shay ! Bill Shay ! I just got a call from my paper . That guy who 's missing , uh ... ? Brother John ? Yeah . Well , the police found his car . They took it downtown . There 's something funny about it . Do you want to come ? DAVID : Sister ? Sister . Have you ever seen the inside of that recovery van ? Why is it so secretive ? Why is it kept locked ? Why is there a special high-voltage power line ? How can you think that that 's a trick ? I know it 's not a trick , but neither is it holy . That glowing- - that special incandescence- - is something that happens to an alien being just before he dies or reverts unless he 's put into a regenerating tube immediately just as they 're doing to Brother Avery right now . I want to see those tubes , and I want to show them to you to prove it . Alien beings . Creatures from another planet- - spacemen , if you like . You 're mad . Sister . Think of every question you ever had about that recovery van . I know what you 're doing . You 're like all the rest of them . You 've no use for anything divine- - anything of the spirit that can 't be proven without ... without spaceships or gadgets or tubes . Help me to prove it . Help me to get inside that van . MAN 1 : Put those flats over in the corner , will ya ? MAN 2 : Sure . MAN 3 : We 're going to need three baby spots down there by the podium . MAN 4 : Right . Go ahead . MAN 3 : Okay , but they 've got to work ... Sister ? I can 't let you stay with us . I haven 't decided yet whether I 'll tell Brother Avery . How long have you been with them ? Not long . They 've given you a lot of responsibility . I 'm a good organizer . I had good training on my father 's political campaigns . Who 's your father ? Doesn 't matter . We take new identities here . MAN 1 ( outside ) : Hey , Charlie , can you give me a hand with these stands ? MAN 2 : What 's the matter with you ? Can 't you see I 've got my hands full ? I 'm going to tell you something so you understand how wrong you are . I loved my father very much . He was everything in the world to me . And then , unfortunately , I discovered he was nothing like the image I had of him . Nothing at all . He was ... Well , let 's just say I was disillusioned . Along came Brother Avery . No . Then along came another man I loved very much , who also turned out a disappointment . Well , I wanted out . I wanted as far out as I could get , and I got pretty far . I had money , I could do as I pleased and find the right set of people to make the trip with . I went pretty much the whole route : LSD , pot . I 'd even started experimenting with something stronger . MAN 1 ( outside ) : Come on ! Move ! Get that painter back here ! Do you have to shout like that ? ! Can I get you some coffee ? One night , we thought it would be fun- - a bunch of us- - to come down and see the prophet . I know how it happened . I was about to the point where I was climbing the walls . And sitting there ... seeing Brother Avery ... it was a revelation . I just couldn 't take it . When I came out of it in the hospital room , he was there . Since then ... he 's given me beauty ... and faith ... and a reason for living . All that couldn 't be a hoax . What if it is ? What if it 's a hoax ? What if he 's really putting you on ? Send you back emptier than you were before . Isn 't that what you 're afraid of ? You still haven 't kicked any habit . You 're still hanging in there . You 're using this whole thing as another trip . ( sobbing ) You just keep right on crying . Because there 's a lot of dirt in this world , baby . Now , either you dig down and find enough character to face it or you cop out . It doesn 't make sense . Why is just this seat scorched just around here and nowhere else ? Let 's get back , huh ? CLAIR : That was when you joined the ministry in Norfolk , wasn 't it ? Yes , of course . I-I thought , well , I ... I mean , I somehow had the impression you ... you once said it was Newport . No . All these questions , Sister ? Places , dates ... It 's just that ... every detail in your life has a meaning for me . I 'm sorry . You need your rest now . ( phone rings ) Yes ? BROTHER AVERY : Oh , yes . Yes . ( loud bang ) Sister Clair ? My child , my child . After all your experience with us , did you really think I was not blessed with spiritual insight ? Come in , Sister . Come in , my child . Please proceed , Brothers . You must forgive me , Mr. Shay , but I 'm afraid we 'll have to postpone the interview . Yes , sir . Good night , sir . Good night . Would you harm us , child ? After the love we 've offered , would you connive with the enemies of our faith ? BROTHER AVERY : Electro-pulsating hospital units . To assist cardiac recovery . Your heart . Has been considerably weakened , yes . Something we 've tried desperately to keep from the press . ( knocking ) Yes ? Gone , sir . Sister Clair , would you please bring Mr. Victor to see me so that I may reassure him of these mysterious tubes of his ? You have a rendezvous with him , I suppose ? Yes , I 'm supposed to meet him in his room at the Granada Hotel . Bring him here . Use Shay . And Sister Clair ? Are the tubes still powered ? BROTHER JAMES : Yes , sir . Very well . Sister will have a heart attack . No . No ! No ! No ! ( knocking ) Hi . How did you know where to find me ? Oh , Sister Clair called and said she couldn 't make it . She didn 't have the strength anyway tonight . She did sound a bit used up . What have you been doing to our little saint ? Did you get the film ? I got it . Well , hallelujah . Let 's go . I 've got a guy waiting up to process it . It 's not here . I stashed it . Well , let 's get it . This guy 's costing me 12 bucks an hour . How would she know you ? No quick answer ? No . Actually , I have no idea . I 'm going to have to be sure . No blood . That 's passing strange . Why do you try , David ? Why do you waste your life ? Where is she ? You know you can 't win . Where ? Regenerating van . They 're waiting for a call from me ... to see that I 've got the film . How do I know she 's not dead ? It 's easy enough to prove . You prove it , we 'll make a deal . Splendid . Move . Why would you hide the film in the auditorium ? I went out that way . I didn 't want to carry it . We 're running short of time . We 'll have to be moving out . I want to see her . Clair . I can 't tell you how sorry I am . It 's all right . I 've got the film . I 'll make a deal . I 'll give you three minutes . 11 : 50- - precisely 11 : 50- - is that clear ? Hold it . I said hold it . Now you 're stalling . We stand right here until you tell me where it is . How do I trust you ? What other recourse do you have ? Clever , Dad . Very clever . After him ! ( gunshot ) No ! ( clanking ) Proceed . Move it out of here as quick as you can . You understand ? ( truck engine starting ) ( knocking ) Come in . I thought you were to stay in bed . Nonsense . Besides , there 's nothing wrong with me that a good paddling wouldn 't cure . No luck ? No luck . Well , what did they think ? That the whole thing was a result of acid stomach ? I think they 'd prefer even that . David , I 'm ... I 'm really terribly sorry . The consensus of opinion has it that , uh ... he was a humbug magician with powers greater than Blackstone . And the electronic bag of tricks got out of hand and burned him up . They say they 'll know more about it when they find Shay . Shay ? But didn 't you tell them ? No . That kind of statement could get me locked up ... permanently . Well , I 'll tell them . I 'll help you . Sure . You know , I was told once that , uh , people had to work at things ... and face them . Or cop out . And what sort of guy would cop out ? Bless you , Sister Clair . NARRATOR : A man and a woman- - two alone in the world- - to resist a multitude ... a mighty host . Two who will move on their separate ways- - watching , waiting , fighting the invaders from the sky .

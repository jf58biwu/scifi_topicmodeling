 ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) Prisoner : Where am I ? Man : In the village . What do you want ? Information . Whose side are you on ? That would be telling . We want information . Information ... Information . You won 't get it . ( Bubbling ) By hook or by crook , we will . Who are you ? The new number two . Who is number one ? You are number six . I am not a number , I am a free man ! ( Number two laughs ) ( Applause ... ) ( Applause ... ) ( Applause ... ) Explosion ) Busy , Potter ? It 's our form of Siberia . What was the colonel up to ? Dr. Schnipps . Crazy scientist . For the last 26 years he 's been building a super rocket to destroy London . Where ? That 's just what the colonel was about to find out . ( Beep ) Excuse me . Ridiculous . Yes . Where do I start ? You 're to go to the Magnum record shop , booth seven . The chief will speak to you there . Chin up , Potter . It was so damned unsporting . It certainly wasn 't cricket . Keep the change . ( Jazzy pop music playing ... ) ( Outside music muffled ) Man : Mission : Find and destroy Professor Schnipps ' rocket . There 's very little help I can give you , I 'm afraid . The opposition have been one step ahead of us all along . Thank you very much . What was that ? Nothing . Standard disguise . Take over where the colonel left off . ( Applause ... ) ( Applause ... ) Explosion ) ( All gasp ) The usual , sir ? Please , Doris . Thank you . Same again , sir ? No , thank you . One of those is quite enough . Brandy . Whiskey ... vodka ... Drambuie . Tia Maria ... cointreau ... Grand Marnier . Sir , you 'll make yourself sick . ( Retching ) ( Water splashing ) ( Humming ... ) ( Banging on doors ) ( Carnival music playing ... ) ( People cheering ) ( Bell clangs , man shouting ) ( Applause , crowd booing ) Ladies and gentleman , those are the sort of fights you don 't see in the ... ( Applause ) And now it 's my privilege to introduce to you for the first time ever in this country at 210 pounds , the Polish giant , killer karminski ! ( Applause and booing ) And now , ladies and gentlemen , another hand I want for the gallant and courageous opponent who has undertaken to go three rounds with the killer . A man of mystery in the front row ... Mr. x ! ( Cheering and applause ... ) ( Imitating old woman ) : Good luck , young man . ( Applause and booing continue ) Killer karminski ! ( Applause and booing ) Mr. x ! ( Applause and cheering ) Now , I want a good , clean fight . No kicking , butting or gouging ... Except in moderation . When I say break , break . Don 't forget , eh ? May the best man win . Go back to your corners . Timekeeper : Seconds out ! Round one ! ( Clangs bell ) ( Crowd shouting ... ) Eh , take it easy , sir , will you ? Me face is me fortune ! You might knock it back into shape ! Break ! You got to go through the tunnel of love . ( Grunts ) What ? The tunnel ... of love ! ( Groans ) ( Groans ) Who ... gave you ... that message ? The lady ... ( Grunts ) Who was she ? I don 't know ! Who ... was she ? Didn 't I tell you , I don 't know ! ( Grunts ) The tunnel of .. Love ! ( Water gurgling . " ) Woman : Hello ... no , don 't turn around . I have you covered . The tunnel of love is very fitting ... Because I 'm beginning to love you , in my way . All my life , I 've been looking for a worthy opponent . You have passed my first little tests brilliantly . You 'll be hearing from me again . Auf wiedersehen . ( Chuckles ) ( Chuckling ... ) ( Laughing wildly .. - ) Explosion ) ( Wild laughter ) ( Woman screams ) Here , what 's your game , Sherlock Holmes ? I 'll spread your nose all over your face . I 'll bash you up and down this fairground . You 'll never pick up your teeth with a broken arm . I 'll tear off your leg and I 'll beat you over the head with it ! Laughing ) I love you madly . Oh ... And I love the way your hair curls on the back of your neck . You 'll make a beautiful corpse . I 'm going to do you the honor of letting you die superbly . But not yet , darling . There 's more fun to come . Woman ( On loudspeaker ) : I 'm glad you came . This is to be our love tryst . You may not see my face , but you may know my name . My name ... Is death . ( Chuckles ) I 'm sorry my father could not be here to greet you but he 's busy with his rocket . Besides , he did not wish to play gooseberry . You are a born survivor . I am a born killer . We were made for each other . But I fear this is where it must end . Your reflexes cannot save you now . It will come swiftly , suddenly , when your luck runs out ... With my love . Come ... Come inside , my darling . ( Firing ... ) Ls your heart pounding ? Your hand shaking ? That 's love , my darling . My father was a great man but the war ended before he was recognized . But when London lies in ruins , he will be a God ! ( Firing ... ) ( Pops ) Nice of you to drop in . I can see you 're having a swinging time . But that 's not quite what I had in mind . Perhaps this will help . ( Motor whirring ) You 'll soon get the point . Incidentally ... They 're electrified . Ingenious . Nobody 's ever thought of that before . You really are the most entertaining lover I 've ever had . ( Firing ) That was ill-mannered , and dangerous ! I might not have been able to warn you that the rest of this floor is mined . Very small , but very sensitive ... and quite deadly . Oh ... I almost forgot . They will all explode anyway in 90 seconds . ( Hissing ) That 's the hot line . Or had you noticed ? ( Explosions ) You 've been through the butcher 's and the Baker 's . Now you 're in the candlestick maker 's . Only he never made candles like these . These are my invention . They have a cyanide derivative mixed with the wax . As the wax burns , it gives off cyanide gas . Every candle in this room is breathing poison into the air . I do so believe in double-glazing , don 't you ? Keeps out the noise . 'Course it does keep out the air , too . ( Coughing ) Oh , a last word of advice . If the candles are blown out , they explode . ( Stifling cough ) ( Coughing ) And that 's only one of the little ones . I warned you your luck would run out . I 've got you now . I 'm glad it 's to be this way . I hate quick farewells , don 't you ? Interesting . I 've noticed mice get irrational in just the same way when they know they 're going to die . In this village , in the past when a great man was dying they sounded the death knell . I think that was a charming idea . ( Bell tolling ... ) ( Machine gun firing ) All right , darling , you win . I 've just realized something . I don 't want to kill you anymore . You were the best . If I kill you , what will be left for me ? ( Engine grinding ) Life would be a bore . Why don 't you join us , my father and me ? We could have a wonderful life together . You would be a constant challenge to me . Come and join me in the bell tower . What do you say , darling ? Don 't let silly pride stand in your way . ( Revving engine ) Bullets ricocheting ) Whee ! Explosion ) Whee ! Explosion ) Whee ! Explosion ) Whee ! Explosion ) ( Engine grinding ... ) Bye-bye , lover . ( Bell tolling ... ) ( Sighs ) ( Bell continues tolling ... ) ( Faint electronic humming and beeping ... ) ( Humming and beeping get louder ) ( Clattering ) ( Humming " Danny boy " ) ♪ From Glen to Glen j ♪ and down the mountainside ♪ ♪ The summer 's gone , and all the roses fall ... ♪ ♪ ' Us you , ' us you j ♪ must bide and I must go ♪ ♪ But come ye back when summer 's in the meadow ... ♪ ( Humming tune ) ( Sighs ) Everybody 's doing it now , you see ? You 're quite sure you killed him ? Father , who taught me ? You 're a girl after my own heart . If only your dear mother could see you now . Oh ... ( Sniffling ) Good old Josephine . Tell me again about her last cavalry charge . Not now , child . We have work to do . Gentlemen ! Yes , all right . That 's very good . In one hour 's time ... ( Chuckles ) London will lie entirely in ruins ! Of course , there will be no more trafalgar square . It will be Napoleon square . And of course Nelson 's column will go to be Napoleon 's column . Uh ... and then my little girl here will be taking over bond street . Oh ! ( Chuckles ) And you merry lads can have ... Chelsea barracks ! Ungrateful swine . And then we 'll be taking over the entire regions . Scottish marshal here ? Present . You keen on soccer ? Oh , aye , sir , I am , I am . Like wembley stadium ? Oh , aye , aye , I would . It 's yours . Welsh marshal ? Yes , sir ? What a great day for the nationalists , sir . Thank you , marshal Jones . Irish ? He 's gone down to the armory , sir . He 'll not be long . Blast ! Of all ... What on earth does he do down there ? The countdown has now started . Hmm ? ( Beeping ... ) Yes , yes ... Of course , thank you . As I was saying ... The , uh , countdown has now already started . In a few minutes , we transfer to the speedboat and control the final phase of the operation from the sea . O 'Rorke will ... Where is Marshal O 'Rorke ? ! Find him at once , all of you ! Oh ... ( Muttering ) It 's Waterloo all over again . Oh ... Jones : He must have come through here . Seen O 'Rorke anywhere ? No . He must have come by . I haven 't seen him . What 's going on here ? I don 't know . Boys ... excuse me a minute . Will you stop ... Scots Marshal : There he is ! Take your firing positions ! Fire ! This one won 't backfire , darling . ( Beeping continues ... ) Mountaineering rope . It would hold an elephant . I must remember that next time I go climbing with one . Oh , I 'm afraid there won 't be a next time for you , darling . I 'm going to give you the most original death in history . You 're going for a rocket ride . Oh , the rocket , that reminds me : Where is it ? It is here . All around you . The lighthouse ... Both : Itself is the rocket ! ( Laughs ) You 've guessed . I say ... you 're not the Duke of Wellington , are you ? Ah ... well , I expect you 're surprised to meet me . Don 't you think it 's clever ? Aren 't I an extraordinary man ? Crazy . ( Chuckles ) This is the nose cone we 're in now . So you see , when the rocket reaches London you will be the first to know ! Won 't that be exciting ? ! I 'll just go to pieces . ( Sharper beeping ) It is time to go aboard the boat . Flight pattern is set . All that remains is to fire the ... ( Chuckles ) Lighthouse when we get out to sea . Bon voyage , darling . Think of me when you hit town . ( Loud beeping ) Careful , careful ! They 're my records , you know . ( Beeping continues ... ) That will do . Muttering y please hurry ! Yes , well ... Three minutes to blastoff . But I must have my papers . These are the history . ( Beeping continues ... ) ( Loud hissing ) ( Engine whining ... ) ( Sizzling and gurgling ... ) Explosion ) ( Wind blowing ... ) Darling , I 've always taught you to be calm and methodical ! Oh ... ! Oh ! What is it ? I forgot to turn the gas off . Oh , father ! ( Engine revs ) Look ! Stop him ! Not those ! These ! Oh , these ... Oh , yes , oh , yes , these . ( Ticking ... ) Number six : And that is how I saved London from the mad scientist . Boys : More ! More ! One more , please . No , no more tonight . It 's way past your bedtime . Come on now , bed . There 's a good girl . Girl : You will come tomorrow , please , please . Yes , we 'll see . Boys : Promise ... promise ... You will come . Tomorrow you will come ... The lighthouse ... No ... ( Boys arguing ... ) Shh ! Sleep . I 'll come tomorrow . I don 't think I have any other important appointments . Shh ... ( Sighs ) " He might drop his guard with children . " ( Scoffs ) " He might give something away . " Well , it was worth a try , number two . He told them a ... He told them a ... Blessed fairy tale . That one wouldn 't drop his guard with his own grandmother ! Number six : Good night , children ... Everywhere . ( Slam echoes )

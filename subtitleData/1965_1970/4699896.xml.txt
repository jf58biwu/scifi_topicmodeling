 Stop him ! This man with the glasses ! Oh , my God . The ambassador . Is he dead ? He must be stopped ! Don 't play the hero . Answer ! For whom do you work ? " For whom do you work ? " You 've already done dumb enough . I 'm warning you . I 'm in a hurry . " I 'm in a hurry . " Let me try , if you allow . This case is very interesting for us at Interpol . It has too many similarities with the murders of the Ambassador in Buenos-Aires and the cardinal in Amsterdam . Answer . Who are you ? Will you speak ? Who pays you ? " Who pays you ? " Hello , sir . You made quickly . Of course . I left London 10 mn after receiving your message . - What 's the matter ? - A real massacre . Almost all of the Ministerial Council and 7 journalists . Incredible ! - A track ? - We caught the assassin . He was hit by one of our agents while trying to flee . Molynski Commissioner in charge of the case . Hello , Commissioner . Sir . - He spoke ? - Not yet . - But we have a movie . - How ? A reporter was on the place . He was wounded but his camera continued turning . The film will be developed in an hour or two . As soon as you 're finshed with the interrogatory I take him to London . General Crosby waits anxiously . Where does he come from ? He looks like a mulatto . I do not know . Stop him ! Stop him ! The fool ! - How astonishing ! - This is incredible ! His skin has changed color . The government palace . It was the presentation of the new cabinet to the Press . Yes , I see . Here is the killer . - This is when the camera fell . - Yes . When the operator was hit . Pretty legs . It 's not the time to joke , Baxter . We were able to determine the identity of the dead . Hawkie Oscar , 35 , skilled worker in Atlanta , USA , disappeared from his home September 4 , 1964 . More than a year already . Let 's start at the beginning . The most amazing thing is the change of color of the skin after the death . From swarthy to white . Could you tell me if the event has already happened during the last 3 years ? I 'll see , sir . " Ingrid Niebauer , student , born in Wiesbaden , disappeared June 12 , 1965 in Cologne found injured at the Penon of Ifach , Spain . Died in the ambulance , dark-brown skin , changed of color dying . 22 years old , single , blue eyes . Distinguishing feature : rhesus zero . " Rhesus zero ? What is so special about it ? No idea . A rare blood feature . This is why it is on the card . Each blood type has a Rh positive or negative . In some rare cases it is neutral . It 's called " rhesus Zero " . Watch . You have Hawkie 's sheet . Ah yes . Am I stupid . If Hawkie was rhesus zero both missing persons were in the same case . They were rhesus zero too . Give me the names of the missing persons disappeared without any trace since 3 years . Easy but there are 2000 entries . - Tell me if some entries contain a rhesus O. - Very well , sir . Yves Barial . He 's a French actor who disappeared . Do you remember ? I think so . There was a lot of talk then . I have been on the case for a time . Rhesus zero : Barial , a U.S. mechanic , a German student ... Where was she discovered , that student ? On a beach in Spain . At Ifach near Alicante . It tells you something ? That 's it ! There it is . Penon of Ifach near Alicante . A tourist said he had seen Barial there a few days before his disappearance . He was in a car surrounded by 3 brown men . Okay . Other contacts ? With them ? No , no . The track was followed . We sent someone in Alicante . No result . Penon de Ifach . A backwater deep in Spain . A German student , a French actor ... You know what I think ? All these disappearances have necessarily a link between them . And then ? Someone seems to be very interested in individuals with a rhesus O blood group . Men and women in the prime of life , in good health . Collected everywhere in the world . Right . You know what we should do ? Send down one of our men who have rhesus zero . A man of forty years , strong , well trained . Unknowingly , he would serve as a trap , a bait . The others would kidnap him . It would lead us to the heart of the organization . Do we have an agent with rhesus zero ? No , unfortunately . There was one . This one . - Al Pereira . - Yes . Good . Lucky us . He shall stand ready to leave immediately . But be careful . He shall not know that he will be kidnapped . He could refuse . Invent a fake mission . Al Pereira used to be one of our best men . He liquidated Paul Vogel and his band . Do you remember ? But unfortunately for us , he retired . He lives on his income . - He must be contacted . Where can we reach him ? - This is not difficult . Somewhere in the world between a blonde and a scotch bottle . Place your bets , please . Place your bets , please . Now , place your bets . You drink too much , you know ? Rien ne va plus . 14 , red , and even missing . You know that you are amazing ? We continue the same system ? What number I shall play ? Wait ... Play 19 . It 's my age . Here , we do not cheat . Play 25 then . Make your games . Rien ne va plus . 25 , red , odd and pass . How lucky ! He still won . Here is your commission . Make your games . Do me a check to bearer , as usual . Al Pereira . Al ... My word , I hear voices , like Joan of Arc . Come . Come here . It 's me , here , the statue . Okay , I 'm coming . Here , the statue . Not bad for a statue . But what is this ? You 're crazy ? My name is Lee Wee . " Lee Wee " ? You are Al Pereira ? Yes , it 's possible . Your weight , your height and age . That 's a secret between my mother and me . No , no . It is no longer a secret . I weigh 78 kg , I measure 1.82 m and last year , I was 40 and a few years . Great . Are you rhesus zero ? - What ? - Are you rhesus zero ? Blood , Rh ... Ah yes . I think I remember ... How do you know that ? We are informed . - You have a cold ? - No . Why ? For nothing . I only ask nicely . You 're really good . Very good . I think so , too . I can go now ? Do you have papers ? Yes . I have my passport , my identity card and my Salvation army card . I do not understand the joke . Yet , you 're Chinese . You have secret papers , microfilms , mission orders ? I 'm past all that since a long time . You know something about the tanned men with glasses ? I do not understand Chinese . Good evening , miss . She is also part of your organization ? Oh no . No , not that . A beautiful tuxedo that I had made in London ! Be careful ! These guys are crazy . Who do they take me for ? - Do you like Spain ? - " Spain " ? I 'll give you $ 100 000 and you 're going to Spain . What for ? To do walking with a blonde woman , boating and sunbathing . - That 's all ? - That 's all . - You agree ? - No . You 're going to Spain , at Penon of Ifach , near Alicante . You executes my orders while making your secret services believe you still work for them . It 's been 2 years since I left . Now you work with them again . - I know . - You 're better informed than myself . There 's someting interesting us there . If you do not agree ... The Chinese torture . I know a lot . I had a teacher who taught me . You can not make me the lesson . Ah yes . For example , this , you do not know , eh ? And that , surely not . They 're really stubborn these Chinese . - Good evening , sir . - Good evening . You had an accident ? No , no . It 's going very well . And you ? I found you a little yellow . Ah yes , the liver . Careful with the liver . 220a 00 : 17 : 30,800 - - 00 : 17 : 32,850 " We 'll meet again very soon . " Hello ? I would like the residence of Allan Maxwell , the American consul . It is not worth it . I 'm here . Baxter from Interpol , your colleague . Rather my ex-colleague . Pereira , how much do you weigh ? I weigh 78 kg , I measure 1.82 m , and in a year I will have 40-odd years . And you 're sure to have ... The rhesus zero ? Perfectly . Tell me , don 't you want to go for a ride ... In Spain , at the Penon of Ifach ? To walk with a blonde , boating , sunbathing , with $ 100,000 in my pocket . 50.000 only . And get intel about tanned men . And what else then ? Who told you about it ? - It 's the talk of the town . - WHAT ? I was on the terrace , then a statue called me and bang ! She knocked me out . The Chinese took me to a restaurant which was an opium den without being one . A guy named Lee Wee stung me with sharp bones . He wanted to send me to Spain . When they started to tear my tuxedo I jumped over the tigers and I ran away . - He 's still drinking . - It 's not so sure . - I was told about that Lee Wee . - He worked for Vietnam . - North or South ? - Both . If the Chinese are already on the case , there is no time to lose . It must be serious . Pereira , the free world needs you . I see you coming . You do not have the right to refuse . Uncle Sam will thank you . - I 'm gonna cry . - Thank you , Pereira . - I was sure you would agree . - Thank you . Here are some pieces of your gear . Beware with this umbrella . It explodes when you open it . I have to walk with it in Spain ? Only on rainy days . But if it rains I can not use it . Of course not . It would explode . And these gloves contain miniature batteries . When you stir fingers , as I do , they are charging . Enough to electrocute a dozen adults or fifteen children . Disconnected , they are harmless . - And that hat ? Is it harmless ? - Absolutely . Beware this cigar . Only light it in case of danger and throw it quickly . It contains a deadly gas . And me ? We planned your protection . This ballpen is in fact a flute . You blow there , vibrations break down a bulb hidden there . It contains another gas that neutralizes the first . You have seen a lot of James Bond movies recently More than you can imagine . Your name is Frank Froeba , you come from Brooklyn . Former boxer became manager . Currently on vacation . Twice divorced , player , drinker , lover of good food and lovely gals . I will try to remember . What shall I do in Spain ? We suspect the existence of a new kind of criminal organization . What kind ? All these crimes have strange things in common . Victims are high-profile characters , mostly politicians . The killers have tanned skin and they all wear glasses . They operate openly with incredible audacity and always following the same method . But there 's something else ... Maxwell and I we believe that this woman is in contact with the murderers . Remember well her features . She will be next Tuesday in Alicante . She calls herself Cynthia Lewis . Can I help you ? Not at the moment . Thank you . So me cuate , you stay or you go up ? I go , hombre . I go . Vamos ! Sorry if I ruined your cigar . Oh no , not this one . This is a gift from my friend Castro . - My God , what a rush ! - This is wonderful . - Single ? - Yes . My name is Cynthia . Frank . - You are a tourist ? - No . And you ? A little , yes . So mi cuate , you go down or stay here ? - I descend . - My God , happiness is so short . Hi , mi cuate , and have fun . What happened to him ? Roses and gladioli are in the crystal vase . Play La Valse triste from Sibelius ... But in D minor . - Froeba Frank . - The 317 , sir . And Cynthia Lewis . - Is it fate that brought us together ? - I hope so . - The 318 , miss . You are together ? Yes and no . If yes , there is a door of communication . If no , there is a lock on the said door . Mr. Froeba , there is a message for you . 327a 00 : 26 : 58,400 - - 00 : 27 : 00,000 " Welcome in Alicante . " You are a funny girl . It 's my greatest quality . I am a simple girl . If you want to be sure , come to Bourbon Club at midnight . Unless you really wish to rest yourself . Come on . Quickly . - Do you want something ? - No , no . Come on , hurry up . You are Al Pereira ? Why do you care ? Get out of here . What , again ? It seems there is a chinese boat on dock 26 . Why do you care ? They told me to warn you . X-3 here . Mission accomplished . Sorry , señor . I 'm sorry . Buenos dias , señora . It sounds . The flowers were not changed . This is the last warning . 87 ... 1176 ... 1927 ... You seem nervous , Cecilia . What 's going on ? Analysis . Quickly . 1617 ... 1833 ... 423 ... 4 . 327 . 16 . 08 . 4 . The Tito case . Mr. Number 1 , answer to our agent in Belgrade . Our clients will have our agreement only if they double the sum . Otherwise , no interest . London ... you received the answer of the Upper Circle to my autorization request ? - Three . - Good . So communicate to London . Agreement in principle on the price of mission Windsor but 22-A has to insist beside his correspondents : " Given the difficulty of the case , we need 15 days preparation " - So ? - No doubt . Rhesus O. Perfect . - You met him here ? - Yes . 1347 . 1508 ... Prepare their program . Carlton Hotel , apartment 317 . They will wait at the hotel and get him back here . This is very unwise to operate so close from here . We can not take this initiative without the consent of the Upper circle . - Let me act . - We usually recruit abroad . - Do you know who is this man ? - I will know . I saw him by chance fighting in the street . Come on , Percy . Do not be angry . - Do what I ask . - Good . - Got a light ? - No . I do not smoke . - Can I sit on this chair ? - Yes . When I 'm gone . - Do you dance ? - Yes . Go ahead , it does not bother me . If by chance you tried this ... No . Not tonight . However I know that the cook of the boat docked at Pier 26 bought a case of whiskey for you . I never drink . - You liked my number ? - Oh , great . Absolutely delighted . - What bothers me is the audience . - It 's sordid . Ah , if we were alone . What a coincidence ! Mi cuate ! We meet again ! - I kept something for you . - Is it true ? Okay ? You 're a champion . We Mexicans , we are good players . But be careful if I find you . Viva Mexico ! Viva los amigos ! Viva ! Viva Mexico ! Viva Mexico ! Adios , mi cuate . Good night , Miss Lewis . - We separate so quickly ? - I 'm afraid . You are right . After all , we hardly know each other . It 's true . Good night . Hello ? Hello ? I 'm going to say them two words . It 's 3 am , and my room is not made . All is turned over and the phone line is cut off . Are you kidding me ? Come on , you 'll see . Check it out . What are you doing here ? What are you doing here ? " What are you doing here ? " It 's not the time to joke . Wait 2 minutes . " Wait 2 min ... " Who is there ? - It 's me , Cynthia . - Oh , shit ! - What do you want ? - Open the door . I have to talk to you . Is it urgent ? It can not wait . - I can not show me undressed ... - I do not care . A moment . Wait . - Open me . - A moment . A little while . I come immediately . Open me or I break down the door . - My shower does not work Can I use yours ? - No , no , no . - Why ? - I never lend my bathroom . - Why ? - Because it is a principle I never lend my bathroom . - Listen Frank . Let me have a shower or I can not sleep otherwise . I have a book by Marguerite Duras . You will sleep wonderfully . Is it true , honey ? Oh , baby , you make me dizzy . Honey , telephone . Yes . Do not move . Hello ? Yes , I hear . Yes . OK . Thank you . Good . Goodbye . There is a corpse in the bathtub . - It bothers me to take my shower . - It 's natural , you know ... Here there are corpses every night . That 's life , but this one is so white and pale ... " Pale " ? - We drank a lot tonight ? - Honestly , no . Why ? For nothing . - You are very impulsive , Frank . - It 's possible . And very unwise . - In your place , I would hide it . - Yes . But where ? - In the closet , as usual - Wonderful idea . Help me . - It will be better in there . - It has a little thing in the stomach . This is a souvenir of the East . This is nothing . Oh no , not again ... Do not move , you . It 's the Grevin museum here . But what is it ? It is hotel service . I 'm busy . This is very urgent . What I 'm doing now is also urgent . I 'm coming . What do you want ? We just come to take the closet . Ah , " the closet " ? Very good idea . Good evening , Mr Froeba . Finally alone . And Pereira ? Still nothing ? Why didn 't they kidnap him yet ? - They tried , but the Chinese ... - Yes ! I know . Meanwhile you know what happened ? Did you see ? In London , Lord Hensey murdered in the middle of lunch . And always the same scenario : A swarthy man with glasses who successfully escapes . How long this comedy will last ? And Olsen ? What is he doing ? No news from him . Not only have you failed but you lost Mr. Eight . You know you had to finish him before leaving . Enough . Out ! No need to get mad at them . It 's absurd . The program was inapplicable . Once is enough . You should not have take this initiative without the authorization of the upper circle . We failed . Hopefully they will not know anything . Forget Frank Froeba . - Nice to see you again . - Me too . You finally decided to come . You insisted so much . This time , you see , I came without tuxedo because of the tailor 's bill ... Shall I rejoice , sir Pereira ? Would you be willing to accept our conditions ? Why not ? What do you want from me ? Why are you here , Mr. Pereira ? If we keep on asking questions to each other we will still be here at Christmas . I 'll answer , Mr. Pereira I will answer . You are here for the same reasons than us . I don 't understand shit about Chinese subtelty . I have nothing to hide from you . You know like me that the center of a criminal organization lies in this region . It happens that members of this organization ... How to tell ? The ... the ... the killers . These killers are controlled at distance . They are somehow puppets , robots . We want the process that enables this transformation . That is all . Unfortunately , we do not know where this organization lies and who is at his head . I see that you are as well informed as me . - Our services are as worthy as yours . - Certainly . With nothing else to do here I retire . - And may the best win . - A moment . Why were you sent at Alicante , Mr. Pereira ? - You know very well . - I , yes . But not you . It 's getting exciting . I think so . You have been sent here to be kidnapped by the criminal organization . Well , well . - You are rhesus zero ? - Yes . It seems that only those who possess this characteristic can undergo treatment that transforms a man into a robot . Your superiors suspected that detail but they feared that you refuse the mission if they revealed the truth . And you 're going to suggest that I let myself be kidnapped on purpose ? I see that you 're worthy of your reputation . They must be bureaucrats diminished by their old age to think that Pereira was going to let them kidnap him , If not willingly . You make me blush . - How much ? - $ 500,000 . This is a significant sum . Worth a few risks . You insist that I have to let them transform me into a robot ? We will do everything to avoid this end . It 's too cute . Let me give you this gun . Once in the heart of the place you will have to shoot like this , and we will come . Okay . And it works ? - Of course . - Good . You know this girl ? - Yes and no . - " Yes and no " ? As the Normans say . Hi . And tell your buddies to not hang in my room anymore . Oh , the little bitch ! Hello . Who allowed you to come in ? Imagine that this is my room here and I pay the bill . And what a bill ! And you ? I 'm Lady Cecilia Addington Courtney . Lady Cecilia ... No , no , stay , lady ... You are very welcoming , Mr. Froeba . You know my name ? I want to know you since the day I saw you fighting in the street . It was nothing . Oh yes . It was beautiful . And to know you better , I had to visit you . Very smart . Pardon my indiscretion . On the contrary , I am delighted . You 're on vacation ? In principle . But now that you 're here ... Tell me about you , Mr. Froeba . Why ? We have better to do . It is so good to be with a man . You should have come yesterday evening . There was an extraordinary surprise party . - Yeah ? Tell me . - It would be too long . So come with me at my home . We can talk more comfortably . Why ? You 're not comfortable here ? The hotel rooms lack privacy . Ah . And then one of your friends might surprise us . This is not a problem . Sorry . I 'm sorry . I ... I 'm afraid of breaking my glasses . - They 're yours ? - Yes . - They look weird . Why ? They fit me very well . Look . - Are you crazy ? - What happened to you ? You are better without them . Come . I kidnap you . Very well but now give me my glasses . I keep them as a souvenir of our meeting . I do not like being bad with women , but if you provoke me , be very careful ... - You would not dare ? - Oh yes . What a pity , Mr. Froeba ! Just when it became so charming . You are a little too smart for a retired boxer . It prevents you from tasting the simple joys of life . Relax yourself , Mr. Froeba . Do not think too much . This is a very friendly advice . Cynthia ... But ... Step back . More . I was wondering about you . Everything is clear now . Lee Wee pays very well , right ? " Lee Wee " ? Why do you work for the Chinese ? You should not . I 'm sorry . Step back ! Frank ! Frank , where are you ? Come back , Frank ! Where does she come from ? From Lisbon . She is almost perfect . Upper Circle speaking . I have other unpleasant news . Some well-placed friends have confirmed your assumptions . The man whom you gave me the picture is not honest . Make the necessary . The saddest part is that another neighbor of yours may create trouble . Newly installed . A man named Pereira . He calls himself Froeba . Yes ? I 'm counting on you . My best regards to Sir Percy . Goodbye . You seem preoccupied , Cecilia . We are surrounded by enemies . Prepare a program . I 've been confirmed this man is dangerous . We have to make him disappear . For the rest , we 'll see later . Pereira , get the hell out of here . Quick . I work with you , but I 'm burned . The robots will catch me . Do not show yourself with me . Get out of here , I tell you . Quick . Get out . - Are you armed ? - No . Thank you . Yves Barial . What is it , Percy ? I do not know what 's happening with Mr. One . - He had to pick Olsen 's pares , right ? - Yes but ... Change his program . Make him come back here immediatey . Guide him . Hey , mi cuate . Hey ! Where do you go ? Don 't you hear me ? Hey ! Are you scared ? But what have you got ? Are you crazy ? Poor cuate . Cynthia , what 's going on ? What 's the matter ? I was afraid . I thought you were like them . " Like them ? " Like these poor monsters . So your Chinese friends dropped you ? Leave me alone , with the Chinese . I wanted to know what they had in their cards . I belong to Interpol . My name is Al Pereira . And you , for who do you work ? I belong to Interpol too . They asked me to follow you , they told me you were dangerous . Oh , the bastards ! They put me in trouble , with their methods . What are we gonna do , darling ? We gotta get out of here . Not immediately . It was so hard to get in . How did you do ? I found these glasses , put them and I felt guided . I got here . The robots are manufactured here . The automat killers . Do you understand ? Madmen run this house . Robots can kill anyone . Why are they doing this ? For a crime syndicate . And you are rhesus zero ? Yes . Why ? Nothing . It is so fashionable nowadays . Mr. Pereira . We now know who you are . Follow me , please . After you . I can not enter . But we 'll see again , Mr. Pereira . Enter . Come here , please . My lady ... Sit . I was itching to continue our conversation . Forgive me if I left so hurriedly yesterday . This is quite natural . I admire you very much , Mr. Pereira . You got rid of Mr. A and you almost held me in check . What courage you had to put these glasses and throw yourself in the lion 's mouth . I would do anything to see you . You should have come earlier . You 'll see . We will work together . All will be very easy with you . You can not get them out ? I do not want you to jump at my throat . I will do you no harm . They annoy me . Me , they comfort me . Do not worry . They have no feeling . Bad for them . Really . Really . They are exemplary servants . What do you do in life , lady ? What 's the point now , Mr. Pereira ? You are here and you will not regret it . It 's certain . And yet you refused to listen to me . You did not want to taste the simple joys of life . Nobody is perfect , you know . Kiss Me . Why Cecilia ? Upper Circle gave orders . He must die and her too . Cynthia ... Not that , not that . They are able to perform only one program ! Lower the levers . Quick ! Ah ! Cynthia ... Good evening . Congratulations , Mr. Pereira . We finally won . I hope that all these emotions do not prevent you from enjoying the pleasures of traveling . I think this way you 'll feel a little more at home . You are very kind but what do you intend to do with us ? To convinc you to work for us . No way . The secrets of Lady Cecilia belong to me until I get the $ 500,000 . You are very funny , Mr. Pereira . The secrets of these two fools are in our hands and you can not take them from us anymore . I protest . This is a breach of trust . Well , Mr. Pereira , if you had not been forced to call , would you have given us these documents ? - Evidently no . You would have given them to your bosses ? Of course . So ... Which of us is the scammer ? You must redeem yourself . You will work for us . This is your last word ? Almost . Poor Mr. Pereira . You were mocked up from the beginning to the end . Your leaders did not want you to defend yourself against a kidnapping . So they 've supplied you with weapons that do not work . Like this very ordinary cigar . Or these electric gloves , a joke . Or this umbrella . It explodes , it seems , when you open it . Come on . Ah , shit . IT IS STILL US ! Mi cuate ! For example ! Climb up . Climb up . Water is good ? Delicious . It 's a great pleasure to see you again . The fish is rare . I missed you . And this time , you can not escape me . We will meet .

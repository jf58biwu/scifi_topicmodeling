 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . You ! Citizen ! Come here . Stop , or we shoot ! Come here , citizen . - What do you want ? - You are under arrest . Arrest ? Well , what have I done ? [ Laughing ] Quite a sight , citizen . What are they doing with that man ? Oh , he is on his way to the guillotine - another aristocrat . That proud head will soon be in a basket . Doug . - Careful , citizen . - It 's a mistake . That man doesn 't belong there . I do not doubt it . Many innocent people go to the guillotine these days . - I 've got to get him out of there . - I would not try it . Your own head will be on the block . They have no right to kill him . He hasn 't done anything . One of those , huh ? Citizen Robespierre has decreed a quota . If it cannot be filled from the prison cells , sometimes it 's filled from the streets . You mean , they just grab people off the streets and cut off their heads ? Oui . It has been known to happen . No ! [ Hoofbeats Approaching ] [ Horse Whinnying ] Aah ! [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . - [ Crowd Cheering ] - Please . There 's no question about that time or place . No . The French Revolution . Reign ofTerror . What year do you make it ? 1 7 93 . Early in the fall , I think . It 's horrible . Can 't bear to watch it . I understand , Ann . I don 't blame you . Hey , that 's the Place de la Revolution . Tony and Doug must be somewhere near the center of Paris . Let 's refine this setting and see if we can zero in on them . Citizens ! This way ! Quickly ! That was a foolish thing to do , citizens . - I warned you . - Sure glad you didn 't take his advice . You took quite a chance yourself just now . Why ? Ah , who knows ? - Perhaps I felt sorry for you . - No , it was more than that . Why did you risk your life to help us ? For one thing , you are foreigners . Your clothing tells me that . Do you make it a habit of helping foreigners ? How do I know I can trust you ? - Perhaps you are spies for the committee . - What committee ? The Committee for Public Safety . Robespierre has spies everywhere . Why would my friend attack the guard to save me ? If I were a spy I could have identified myself and had my friend released . Yes , there - there is that . But if you are indeed foreigners ... perhaps you are here to help the widow . - The widow ? - Oui . The widow Capet . The queen of France . - Marie Antoinette ? - Oui . Alone in a cell in the Conciergerie ... separated from her children , without friends . - Perhaps you are here to help her , no ? - Now , wait a minute . Why are you so interested in Marie Antoinette ? Before the - the revolution ... I was held in the Bastille because I defended her name ... against certain factions in court who were opposed to her . She ordered my release ... and out of gratitude for my defense of her name she became my patroness . And now - Now I have sworn to help her . There 's no way to help her now . - Hasn 't she been condemned to death ? - No . No . Not yet . Since the king was beheaded lastJanuary ... they have been looking for evidence enough to condemn her , but so far they have failed . Still , they keep trying and her time is running out . - There is no way to help her . - Still , we must try . You are alone in Paris , and that is good . But you need other clothing . You cannot walk around the streets this way . - Where can we get them ? - [ Man ] Guards . ! - [ Gasps ] Shh ! - Search this house . ! [ Whispering ] They are still looking for you . Through there is a staircase . Take it . At the top of the stairs is a closet . Put on the clothing you find there . But hurry ! Guards ! This house ! Open up . ! Open up in the name of the Republic . ! - [ Pounding On Door ] - Open , or we break it down . ! Oui , oui . ! Coming ! I am - I am coming . Search this house ! It is reported that you were seen giving shelter ... to enemies of the revolution . Monsieur , there is no one in there but me . Indeed . And soon there will be no one at all . In the name of the Committee of Public Safety ... I arrest you for treason to the sacred cause of the revolution . Seize him ! Take him away ! We 're losing them . Our image is drifting away . We don 't even know if they were captured . General , what 's wrong ? - General ? - Hmm ? Oh , I 'm sorry . That period in history always does something to me . I think it affects all of us . - Can we get them out of there ? - No , I don 't think so . Our signal is very weak . Well , how about the irradiation technique ? We 'll send back something that we can get a focus on ... something that 's , uh - Here . - This ? - That ring is an heirloom . It 's , uh , fairly distinctive . You think Tony and Doug would recognize it as mine ? - I 'd recognize it . - I think they would too . Ray , is your fix good enough to send this back ? It may be , General . But why your ring ? It 's small , compact , easily recognizable by them . Yet it 's something from the period that wouldn 't readily arouse anyone else 's suspicions . I think it 's the ideal object to use as a focal point . - Don 't you think so ? - Well , we 've got enough energy to handle something this size . If only we could be sure they 'd recognize its significance . They would . I know it . Send it back . General , I 'm not altogether sold on this irradiation technique . Even if we get the ring back and they find it ... the odds are all against our bringing them both back . - There is a chance ? - A one-in-a-million chance . Then try it . All right . Ann , we 'll place this in the radiation bath at 30 seconds exposure . - Good . - Prepare for the transmission . Right . Doug ! - What did you find out ? - They 've arrested him , all right , poor old guy . - Where did they take him ? - The Temple . It 's the main prison . - I think they 're going to execute him . - Execute him ? It 's our fault he got into this . We can 't let him die . We 're gonna be lucky to get out of this place alive ourselves . But , Doug , we still have to try to help him . How far is the Temple from here ? We can 't go up there . That place is swarming with guards . Besides , we don 't even know his name . Doug , there it is right above the shop window - Blanchard . Citizen Blanchard . All right . We 'll manage to free him somehow . We 'd better get out of here . The ring is ready , and it 's in the tunnel . - Haven 't you relocated them yet ? - Almost . [ Ann ] There . That should be it . - Those two men in the shadows - could they be Doug and Tony ? - [ Ray ] I think so . - Yes , I can make them out now . - Right ! We 've got ' em . - Can you hold that , Ann ? - Not for long . It 's not very stable . All right , let 's send the ring now . It 's gone . - How will we know if the ring gets to them ? - We won 't , General . Not until we can regain our focus . - What do you think , Ann ? - I don 't know . If we start getting emanations from the ring we may do better . But right now I 'm not getting a thing . I guess you were right . Everybody in Paris seems to be under suspicion . That 's why we can 't do much without help . - Maybe we 'd better concentrate on getting ourselves out of Paris . - That won 't be easy either . Remember your French history ? Every gate and road out of this city is guarded . - No one 's allowed to move without a passport . - Great . [ Clinking ] Look ! - A gold ring . - Let me see that . - What 's the matter ? - Don 't you recognize it ? - No . - It 's Kirk 's . - How could it be ? - Doug , I remember admiring it once . He said it was an inheritance . I 'm certain this is the ring . Kirk 's ring . That means they sent it back as a focal point . - It 's part of the irradiation technique . - Right ! - Look . - That proves it . They 've got a fix on us now . They can bring us back . Put it on . What about you ? It doesn 't matter which one wears it as long as we don 't get separated . Go ahead . Detail , halt ! Search this house . If you meet with resistance , use your weapons . Hey , kid ! It 's Kirk ! - General ! - Who called ? - General , here ! - Come out , citizen , and show yourself ! . Shh ! Come here . - Come out ! - If you only knew how glad we are to see you - Stop in your tracks , or you are a dead man . Okay , we 'll play along . - We found your ring . - Ring ? The ring . What are you talking about ? Give me the ring . Give it to me ! Guards ! These two unworthy citizens are Royalist spies . Arrest them . " " To Axel from M.A ... . with eternal love . " " " M.A. " Marie Antoinette . This may cost the Austrian wench her head . [ Panting ] It 's amazing . He looked exactly like the general . He sure had me fooled . Welcome to the Temple ofJustice . - I 'm sorry . - Yeah . We are all sorry these days . - Guillotine ? - Without a doubt . - When ? - Who knows ? Perhaps tomorrow . Perhaps a week later . It all depends on the demands of the quota . There any chance of escaping this place ? It has been done . But we need time and to be left alone . Oh , my apologies , citizens . Such accommodations are hardly fit for Royalists . We 're not Royalists . We 're citizens of the United States . And we demand to see the American ambassador . " " Demand " ? You 're scarcely in the position to make demands , citizen . What do you intend to do with us ? Before we discuss your ultimate fate ... I have some questions of my own which require answers . Where did you get this ? - We found it in the street . - Oh , come now , citizens ! If you 're going to lie , at least do me the honor to be more inventive . That shopkeeper ... has long been suspected ofbeing an admirer of Marie Antoinette . He gave you the ring , hmm ? Am I right ? No , citizen . I have never seen that ring before this moment . Hmph . I wonder which one of you ... knows the Swedish diplomat Count Axel von Fersen . - Hmm ? - Fersen . Von Fersen . - Well , do you know the man ? - There was a von Fersen with Washington at Yorktown . Ah ! You have a commendable knowledge of recent events . But this does not answer my question . - Do you know this man ? - No . - What does that man have to do with the ring ? - Everything . You didn 't think I 'd recognize it , did you ? This ring was a gift to him from the widow Capet long before she became a widow ! - It is a lie . - Is it ? " " To Axel from M.A. with eternal love . " For nearly a year now ... Citizen Hebert and his committee have been seeking the evidence to behead that woman . And to think that I now hold it right in my hand . It is a lie . Fersen was only a friend of the queen . - No more . ! - This is a love token . She was in love with a foreign diplomat , proof enough ofher treasonous actions . ! It is a lie ! A lie ! No , no ! No killing . I want them all to die on the guillotine . Citizens , I owe you a debt . This ring will cost your queen her head . It will also make me a hero of the revolution . Many thanks . For your reward ... all three of you will encounter what my sansculotte friends like to call ... the national razor . Until tomorrow morning , my friends , a bientot . Oh , it 's impossible . My ancestors came from Scotland , not from France . It 's all right , Woody . - No one 's accusing you of anything . - I know what you 're thinking . An ancestor of mine sending Tony and Doug to their deaths . A man is not responsible for the behavior of his forefathers . But , blast it , he 's not an ancestor ! None of my people came from France . Of course he isn 't , General . Only you must admit it 's a rather startling resemblance . [ Sighs ] Merci . We 're getting out of here . - Impossible . - We 're going to try . Will you help us ? I am not afraid to die any longer . There is only one reason I would want to escape - the queen . We can 't help her . I must get word to her about this ring and how they plan to use it against her . There 's nothing we can do . We want to get out of Paris . - You need papers . - Where can we get them ? There are still some powerful men devoted to the queen . Her signature will carry a lot of weight with them . In other words , you can get us out of Paris ... if we can help you reach Marie Antoinette . Precisely . Well , what do you say about it ? All right , we 'll help ... if we can . Thank you . Now we must plan our escape . It 's already planned . Take off your vest . [ Grunting ] - No pursuit ? - No pursuit . - I hope it 's as easy to get into the Conciergerie . - It will not be . How about these uniforms ? Won 't they help ? No , we must think of another plan , a better one . - How much time do we have ? - It will be a few hours before they discover our trick . It will be time enough . Let us go . - What happened ? - We lost the picture temporarily . They just found out Tony and Doug escaped . Ann , turn up the audio . [ General ] Our missing guests are both clever and courageous . But they are also loyal to this woman they still call a queen . They will go to warn her . I will be there to greet them . What 's happened to Tony and Doug ? I can 't pick them up . The image keeps shifting to your - to that other man . It 's your ring that 's doing it . We 're zeroed in on it , and we can 't shake it . He would be wearing it . I don 't see what we can do but wait and watch for our chance to save them . He 's on his way now to arrest them . He 's not going to let them escape again . I know . But what can we do ? Only one thing . Bring him back . - We can 't do that . - Why not ? - We 've got a perfect fix . - But what about Tony and Doug ? They 're safer where they are if that man is right here in the Time Tunnel . It 's risky . We have no idea how he 'll react to a shift in time . I don 't care how he reacts . Right now I want that man here , in front of us , where I can talk to him face-to-face . Will you make the shift or not ? Well , we 'll try . It doesn 't mean it will work , but we 'll try . - All right , Ann , make the preparation . - Right . [ Tunnel Oscillating ] Get me an armed detail ! Be quick about it ! What is this place ? Answer me ! Welcome to the 20th century , citizen . Am I going mad ? Who are you ? What is this place ? Put away your gun . I brought you here to answer questions , not to ask them . Put it away ! - [ Exhales ] Well ? - That 's better . You 're wearing a ring that belongs to me . I want it back . Ah . I assume you have proof of ownership . - I don 't need proof . You 're my prisoner . - Prisoner ? Well , France is at war with many countries now , but I see nothing here that is familiar . Surely this is not Austria . This is America ... but nearly two centuries after your time . I don 't expect you to accept that fact , but it happens to be true . Ah , this is the age of reason , citizen . We no longer believe in witchcraft . Neither do we . This isn 't witchcraft . It 's science . My ring , please . - This is actually the 20th century ? - It is . Then the ring belongs to me by right of prior ownership . I can have it removed by force . - It will cost you the life of at least one man . - Is the ring that important ? It is important to France , to the revolution . - You 're going to use it to kill the queen . - The widow Capet . - Isn 't there enough blood on your hands already ? - You speak like a Royalist . Listen to me . Your revolution is already won . You did behead Marie Antoinette ... and without the evidence of that ring you 're wearing . How can you know these things ? It 's , uh , history now . Come here . Let me show you . See what you can pick up now . [ Reverberating ] The Conciergerie ? And the widow ? What kind of magic is this ? The age of reason , citizen . You 're witnessing history . Watch . - Widow Capet . - What do you want ? - We 've brought you a priest . - I don 't need one . Leave me alone . Your Majesty . - You . You shouldn 't have risked coming here . - Don 't be alarmed . My children . You 're bringing bad news of my children . No , no , no . They are both well . But why are you here ? - To warn you , Your Majesty . - To warn me ? The Committee for Public Safety is about to receive a ring . They will use this as evidence against you ... on the grounds that you gave it to a certain foreign gentleman . Axel . They know about him . Am I to be spared nothing ? But they have invented lies about this ring and why you gave it to Count von Fersen . - Lies ? - Oui . My poor , devoted friend ... I loved Axel von Fersen . I will never deny it . They 'll use it against you . We 've come to warn you , to give you a chance to prepare a defense . Defense ? As God is my witness , I have committed no crime against my adopted country . Still , they call me the Austrian wench ... and other names so foul I can 't repeat them . Nothing can save you now ! In a matter of days we 'll have your head ! Release me at once ! In the name of the Republic , I demand it ! - You 're not in France now . - Let me go ! Send me back ! These men have no right to interfere with the execution of that Austrian woman ! You 're right on one score - they can 't interfere with history . Marie Antoinette will die at the hands of your fellow citizens . - How do I know she will pay for her crimes ? - I can prove what I say . Ann , move your fix ahead to October 1 5 , shortly after high noon . The time of her execution ? Please , don 't make me . I don 't want to look at it . All right , I 'll take over . All right , citizen , here 's your proof . [ Drumroll ] - [ Blade Lands ] - [ Crowd Cheering ] There 's your revenge . I hope you 're proud of it . All right , Ann , it 's over . I 've switched the image back to where it was , a week before her execution . Take over the controls . I hope this will help you and your friends escape from this terrible city . If only we could do more for you . There is nothing . I am beyond help . Doug , maybe something can be done . The Dauphin . That 's right . Nobody knows what happened to him . Maybe he did escape . There are lots of legends , even that he came to America , became a famous man . What about the Dauphin ? My son ? My little Charles . If there were any hope of saving him - Gentlemen ... there is a chance , if you will help me . I don 't know . Where is he being held ? In the Temple , in a special cell . The Temple ? Why , it 's filled with guards . No , with this paper , and for a cause like this ... I can get gold for bribes and all the necessary documents . Do this , and I guarantee to get you out of Paris . I have no right to ask for my sake ... but for the sake of a helpless child - We 'll do everything we can , Your Majesty . My thanks . Your Majesty . Those men of yours must be stopped . They are trying to save the Capet boy . - I hope they do before we bring them back . - Back ? - You are returning them here ? - We 're going to try to . With the help of that ring you 're wearing . Remove the ring from his finger . - [ Sighs ] - [ Kirk ] Place it in the tunnel . What are your plans for me ? You 'll stay here until , or if , our men return . If they do , we 'll send you back to your own time . - Ray , start the countdown . - Prepare coordinates . [ Switches Clicking ] Activate . You are going to let them save that boy ? Let him become Louis XVII ? No ! I will not permit it ! Don 't try to follow him ! It 's too late ! Don 't try to follow him ! It 's too late ! [ Sighs ] Guard ! Find me a carriage . I must get to the Temple at once ! - Any luck ? - Not a sign of him yet . Do you think he might have been arrested ? Anything could happen in this town . - Without the papers he promised , we 'll never get out of Paris . - I know . - [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Someone 's coming . My friends . ! It is I. ! Here . I had a little trouble , but it is all right now . Gold . I find the constabulary is extremely sensitive to it . - Did you get the passes ? - Ah ! Oui . ! An official pass from Robespierre himself . A forgery , of course . It permits two guards to escort one art instructor ... to the cell of the Dauphin for a lesson . - Art instructor ? - Ah , oui . I am resigning from the priesthood . Voila ! An artiste ! - But how do we get out of the city ? - Oh ! I have , uh , four passports . for a young man , his grand-pere and , uh , two uncles . I believe that covers everything , huh ? You 've had a busy evening . - We are going to have a busier night . - Let 's go . Very good , my boy . Very good indeed . With instruction , you can become a painter - a fine painter . Thank you , m 'sieur . Citizen , you scummy spawn ! I beg your pardon , Citizen Simon . I meant to say , " " Thank you , citizen . " Well , mind what you say or I 'll box your ears for you . Yes , citizen . - Citizen , I must ask you to leave me alone with the boy . - Impossible . My orders are never to leave him alone . Guard , the pass . I have seen that pass already . Then you realize I have the authority to teach the boy . I am his tutor . He needs nobody else . Oh , then you choose to ignore the orders . Bon . Citizen Robespierre will be interested to learn this . Wait . I am a patriot . I obey my orders . Then leave me alone with the boy . All right . Ten minutes . No more . - Will you be my teacher now , sir ? - Oui , mon petit , from now on . What about Simon ? Who , that shoemaker ? You can forget about him . - I 'm glad . He beats me , you know . - He will never beat you again . - Now , come . Let us gather your things . - We are going away ? Oui , mon petit , to another land entirely , with God 's help . Quick . I am looking for three men - strangers . - They plan to kidnap the Capet boy . - Three men ? - There are three men with him right now . - Follow me ! Citizen , be careful . They have a pass from Robespierre himself . Idiot ! It 's a forgery ! They are traitors ! Let no one out of here without further orders . No one ! Hurry up . We 're taking too long . - You 'll have to forget that . We have no time . - Leave it . Come . They 're coming . Take the boy out that way . We 'll try to hold them off . Around to the side ! Quick ! They 're getting away ! Another wagonload of aristocrats for Pere Lachaise . - Are we through the gates ? - So far , so good . Next stop , Calais ... and freedom . - You must be exhausted , Ann . I 'll get a relief for you . - No . No , not yet . Not until we 're sure Doug and Tony get away to safety . Any new developments ? Well , I 'm getting less and less interference from the ring all the time . It 's making it a lot easier for me to keep a fix on Doug and Tony . - Can we try a time shift ? - I wouldn 't risk it yet , not unless we have to . - Why is the effect of the ring getting weaker ? - The radiation is wearing off . - Where is the ring now ? - He 's still wearing it . - Can we bring him back again ? - We could , General . But I don 't see any point in it . The committee has been alerted by this time . They 'll track down Tony and Doug whether he 's around or not . I can work him over , get him to change the orders and free Tony and Doug . No , it won 't work , General . Besides , we 've got to conserve power for one last attempt to shift them . You 're right , of course . Uh , incidentally , I - I just got word from Research . A branch of my family did migrate to Scotland from France . Then you are a descendant of his . Yes . One thing this has done : It 's cured me of any tendency toward ancestor worship . Well , keep at it . Bonsoir , gentlemen . I am Lieutenant Bonaparte . May I see your papers ? Uh ... here you are , Lieutenant . These indicate you are citizens of France . Yet your accent is foreign . Well , forgive me , Lieutenant , but so is yours . France is my adopted country . I am from Corsica . France is also my adopted country . Your insignias indicate you 're a lieutenant in artillery . You find something strange in that ? In a sense , yes . An artillery lieutenant from Corsica in the French army must be very rare . True . I am , perhaps , the only one . I thought so . Tell me , Lieutenant , do you believe in destiny ? Only a fool would not . I 'm a great believer in destiny . There are those who say I have second sight . Looking at you , Lieutenant , the strangest visions appear to me . - Indeed . What visions ? - Forgive my friend , Lieutenant . He 's too modest . He has the ability to see the future quite clearly . For you , sir , I see great things , soon . [ Chuckles ] I believe in destiny , m 'sieur , not fortune-telling . I see France in ruins , and out of it rises a great leader ... to carry the country to the days of its greatest glory . And that leader , Lieutenant ... I say , is you . It 's going to happen . He 's never wrong . - Now , may we pass ? - One moment . - Are there any others ? - No . We 're traveling alone . Days of greatest glory , you say . Beyond anything you can possibly imagine . Yes . This is a vision I share . Alors . Very well . Pass on , citizens . We 're getting under way . - Where 's the boy ? - Down below , in the hold . Stop the ship . ! Stop the ship . ! Get below with the boy ! We 'll lead them away ! Come on ! Stop the ship , in the name of the Committee of Public Safety ! Search this ship from stem to stern . I want all four of them . - What is the meaning of this ? - We 're looking for an old man and a small boy . No doubt you allowed them to walk aboard under your very nose . I have passed no such passengers , and you will not delay the sailing of this ship . Cast off the lines ! Get under way at once ! Citizen , you will pay for this insolence . - I will report you to the committee . - Do that . To make it easier , you shall have name - Bonaparte . Lieutenant Napoleon Bonaparte . Bonsoir , citizen . Those men ! Arrest them ! Shoot them . ! Shoot them . ! Fire . ! Shoot them . ! Somehow , there 's a unfriendly feel in the air . - Europe ? - Could be . Not France or Spain . Not Northern Europe though . - Germany . - No . Farther east , I think . 1 850 , 1 900 . It 's hard to tell about Europe . Some of these places haven 't changed in hundreds of years . I can 't make it out . It 's a Cyrillic alphabet . That 's Southeast Europe . Tony . Today is June 1 6 , 1 956 . Looks like the kind of city where you might need identification papers . Maybe we won 't be here that long . Look ! What 's the matter ? - Tony , let go of it ! - I can 't ! - [ Exhaling ] - Are you all right ? [ Tony ] Time Tunnel gave it too much power . At least their time lock was accurate . Accurate , but not enough control . The day they solve the problems of control is the day we 'll get home . [ Panting ] [ Tony ] There 's another one .

 What sounds like a fairy tale today , may be tomorrow 's reality . Here 's a fairy tale from the day after tomorrow . There are no more nations . Only humanity and its colonies in space . Distant stars have been settled . The ocean beds are inhabited . Space ships cross the galaxy at unimaginable speeds . One such ship is the Orion . A small link in a great chain of defence against threats from space . Let 's join Orion and her crew on patrol at the edges of infinity ... 4 . Deserters Subtitles by Anders M Olsson Object spotted . Target identified . Kapolus - 5,300 meters deep crater without central hill . Watch closely , McLane ! A diameter of 35 kilometers . Attention - Overkill ! Attention - Overkill ! Attention - Overkill ! The crater 's been enlarged by at least 50 times . A terrifying weapon . And that was only a small scale test . But one day there might be a critical battle against the frogs . We know that they 've developed counter-measures against our ray-guns . That renders our light - throwers obsolete . Not entirely , but Overkill lets us eliminate an entire hostile fleet as soon as it 's been discovered . - I doubt the frogs will attack . - I wouldn 't be too sure . We don 't know much about the frogs so we must be prepared for everything . That sounds reassuring . Atan , lightwave to Earth : Experiment Overkill has been a success ! Sir , Orion 8 informs that experiment Overkill has been a success ! You asked to be kept up to date . I see . Thank you . Sorry , colonel . Please go on ! As I said , there has never been a more serious incident . An attempted desertion by a commander . And to the frogs , no less . - Has he lost his mind ? - No . The commander of the Xerxes has been under surveillance for three weeks . A medical staff has examined and hypnotized this Alonzo Pietro , tested his reflexes , and analyzed the results . There 's no sign whatsoever of mental disorder . Pietro is as normal as you and I ! I don 't distrust the staff , but are you sure that there was no mistake ? These are serious accusations which contradict all experience . I can only repeat that Pietro , in spite of being at his senses , attempted to desert to the frogs ' base . - AC-1000 . - Exactly . - I 'd like to see that man . - You may . Bring in commander Pietro ! No offense , Villa , but I 'm a skeptic . We now know that the symptoms in the Vesta sector were due to space-madness . Commander Pietro has served there . I can assure you that Pietro has no such symptoms . - But others , perhaps ? - No , we 've checked that . How ? You don 't even know what disease it is . Or the symptoms of that disease . We 've examined Pietro very thoroughly . We expected a mental disorder . But found absolutely nothing . Pietro is completely healthy ! A commander who deserts to the frogs can 't be healthy ! That will cause a disaster once it gets known within the space fleet . Order will break down . If you can 't trust the commanders , the security of Earth is in jeopardy . I agree . So does the supreme space command . Nowadays , the outer space stations are manned by robots . The results have been great . No breakdowns , no emotions . Space captains might also be replaced by robots . Commander Pietro has arrived . Pietro ? What do you have to say ? Nothing . Your space-ship had been programmed for AC-1000 . I know nothing of that . You certainly know how to drink ! Did McLane teach you that ? Speak of the devil ... Fill me up , please ? Why can 't you tell me the outcome of the meeting ? That 's classified . I know . But Pietro 's been a close friend of mine for eight years . I can 't believe what I 've heard . Better believe it , Cliff . Pietro 's confessed plans for delivering Xerxes to the frogs . Seriously ? Xerxes operated in the Vesta - sector , at our station M8-8-12 . That 's where I 'm going to install Overkill , and at K16 . The light thrower stations are exposed . They need our most powerful defence . - Why are you so nervous ? - I 'm not ! You are , every time McLane shows up . " McLane " - don 't you have anything else to talk about ? - You started it . - I did ! ? Let 's enjoy ourselves ! Let 's talk about you ! You 're said to be a real bitch . Not so loud ! I 'm only doing my job . I 'm sure that 's the right thing to do . An intelligence officer can easily get a bad reputation . Cliff ? Are you afraid of your security officer ? Why ? Or is she afraid of you ? If only she were . You 're staring at each other as if your eyes were overkill-weapons . Or you may be jealous of one another . General van Dyke ! I must be off , Cliff . When will you leave ? Tomorrow morning at six . Don 't look too happy , Cliff ! Your security officer might think we 're dating . Well , have you done your homework ? Not at all . You can never study too much . I can help to test your skill . Besides , you must report to general van Dyke . Why ? I don 't serve under her . I 'm only the messenger . Perhaps it 's a special assignment ? So goodbye ! See you later ! I keep my fingers crossed ! - Bye then . - Bye . Do you enjoy playing tricks on a young officer ? We 've all been young . It 's part of the training . You seem to take your reassignment hard . Look who 's talking ! What about your flirting and drinking ? What about you ? I had a professional conversation with the general . That 's your version . Besides , you 're not in command here . My company is none of your business . It is , in a personal way . But you wouldn 't understand . What 's the matter with you ... ? Easy ! In a little while , we 'll all suffer from space madness . Space madness ? Everyone who 's been on M8-8-12 has been affected . The general says so . We 're not likely exceptions . Your general isn 't up to date with the latest developments . Only robots work there now . Tin men ? I knew it . - Secret project . - Courtesy of your boss , I 'm sure . Doesn 't intelligence have more urgent matters to attend to ? - They do now - your health . - What 's that supposed to mean ? By order of intelligence , we 'll be accompanied by a physician tomorrow . - Without my approval ? - Easy , easy ! I have the order for you to read . That 's the last straw . I resign ! You don 't approve of my presence ? I don 't mind you . Nowadays people push me around all the time . The commander doesn 't feel up to take responsibility for a doctor . On the contrary . I 'll be responsible for you and your crew . But let 's do it together . That way it won 't be a burden for any of us . - Agreed ? - Yes . You know , professor , we thought you 'd be a little gnome who ... Brain specialist , right ? Great occupation ? It becomes what you make of it . Exciting . Almost like being a space captain . Surely there are differences . - Have you heard of Pietro Alonzo ? - I 've read the report . - What do you say ? - It doesn 't say much . No clues . It 's a mystery . - I wonder why Pietro confessed . - The investigation is still open . - Desertion is an act of free will . - This is mad ! - Why so ? - The frogs do without oxygen . He would die immediately . He knew that . And you knew Pietro . Did he want to die ? Something must have changed in his brain . What is not known . And how - that 's what I 'm here to find out . - Then we 'll be your guinea pigs . - In a way , yes . Perhaps you do have a sense of humor ? Orion 8 calling light thrower station M8-8-12 . We 'll be landing on the planetoid in four minutes . Landing automation and oxygen supply on . M8-8-12 over ! Please respond and confirm ! What 's the matter , numskulls ? Orion 8 calling M8-8-12 . Landing automation and range finder on . Orion requests an execution report . Mario , do you know why the robots don 't respond ? - Asleep , I guess . - Problems , commander ? Hello ! Orion 8 calling M8-8-12 . M8-8-12 over ! Cliff , the landing beam is on ! Finally ! But what turned them on ? - Can we land now ? - Yes . Are you afraid ? - Just a bit uneasy . - After 36 days in space ? Engineering : Full deceleration ! Cliff , should I notify station 45 of our landing ? Please do , lieutenant ! Engineering to the commander : Ready to land ! What might be wrong , Atan ? No data processing . Perhaps exhaustion ? They don 't say a thing . No status reports , nothing . Robots like these are only used at exposed stations . They 're considered especially durable . But not friendly enough to come and greet us . If only I knew more . It 's a new model I haven 't seen before . - What about you , Atan ? - I can 't even find the latch . Try there ! - What a natural ! - 15 years in space teaches a lot . 15 years ? That doesn 't show ! One does one 's best . Nowadays the galaxy isn 't too exciting . There are rules for everything now . Watch out , Cliff ! It attacks ! Use your ray-gun ! Damn ! Has it gone mad ? And robots are supposed to be more reliable than humans . What might have happened ? Either a programming error or a neurosis . Such things do happen . Perhaps a memory overload . That 's all very well , but the smallest child knows that a defective robot never can break the first law , and attack a human . - There must be more to it . - Sabotage ? I 'm sure of it . Hasso , would you render the other comrade harmless ? I don 't dare . Get Tamara ! - She 's recently taken a course . - Great idea ! Commander McLane calling the Orion . Orion over ! Here 's lieutenant Jagellovsk . Have you taken training on the new robots , the Gamma-7s ? Yes , they 're the most reliable I 've seen so far . Then come over and have a look ! Sigbj√∂rnson will relieve you . Helga , have you heard from H5 ? - No , H5 doesn 't answer . - Then try Olaf 1 ! - Done that . - And ? No response from them either . - Do you still believe in technical malfunctions ? - What else ? Neurotic robots and communications breakdowns that can 't be explained . I 'm sure Olaf 1 is busy with more important matters than returning our calls . Let 's work ! We don 't want to stay too long . Overkill must be installed . What happened to the robots ? See for yourself ! I 'm sure you 're in for a pleasant surprise . - What 's going on , sir ? - Just a moment . A12 through 27 disconnected , Mario ! Let me try . - You must be bored , professor ? - No , I find it most interesting . - Can we begin verification ? - Soon as we 've connected the sectors . Lieutenant , would you help us verify ? - I 'd love to . - Use that panel ! Atan . Atan ! 12X minus 12 . Sector 2 towards 12 . B14 towards 32 . Great . Thank you ! A47B minus 3 . Yes , great . Thank you ! Gamma 17 minus delta 4 . Well ... yes that 's fine . Thank you ! Hello Orion ! Hello Orion ! Please respond ! Hasso , answer me ! Hasso ! Hasso , are you asleep ? Answer me ! What 's going on ? Hasso ! - Is that you , Cliff ? - Yes , what 's going on ? - We 're working ourselves to death , and you sleep . - Sorry , just a bit drowsy . - Are you ready ? - Yes . We 'll proceed to K-16 in one hour . - You can program the course now . - Will do , Cliff ! One more trip of overkill - installations , and I 'll resign . Let 's be happy that we 've made it . What a poor consolation coming from you ! It 's nice to see that your mood has improved . Off to K-16 and the next installation ! But first a few hours sleep . Helga , why don 't you go too ? Tamara , please turn on the robots ! Isn 't it strange , professor ? We 've worked all night , and nothing 's happened . The saboteurs haven 't shown . Let 's wait and see . They may still show . And after this , another Overkill . It gets on my nerves . We 'll soon be through . How are you ? Don 't you feel well ? - Why ? - I just thought so . It 's one hell of a way , and the next time , I 'm going to tell them to ... - Everything alright ? - Yes , it ... is . - Are you tired ? - Why do you ask ? You seem so exhausted . - Well , I 'm not . - Great . - Let 's make ready for take-off . - OK . Too bad your time with us has been in vain . In vain ? Nothing 's happened . No space madness , no frogs , no desertions . Don 't crow too soon ! We 're not through yet . - Just be happy that there are no problems ! - I am . But if nothing happens to us , Pietro must be a deserter . I have a problem with that . - Atan , can we ... ? - In a moment ! Tamara will take over at the weapons console . Mario has to sleep . Are you sure you 're alright ? Don 't start again . You 're getting on my nerves . - I 'm here to give medical care . - Yes , I know . You 've been watching the computer all the time . So what ? - Have you noticed anything special ? - Like what ? Why don 't you tell me how it works ? - I don 't give lectures ! - Why not ? - I would have enjoyed it . - Cliff , let 's get started ! What 's this ? Commander McLane to the crew . Lock the ABC-complexes . Inhibit thrusters ! Full isolation and radio blockage ! All hands report to the bridge ! Condition alert ! So it 's time ? Yes , but it 's no medical case . It 's a job for security . Faulty coordinates have been programmed . 2-9-4-19-30-37-3 . - But that 's ... - The course for AC-1000 ! The same as Pietro programmed . We 've got a traitor on board . Until counterevidence found . In compliance with space regulation sect . 238-9 , I take command of the ship , and of the criminal investigation . We 'll only be slightly delayed . - Lieutenant Sigbj√∂rnson ... - Easy , Tamara ! Lieutenant Sigbj√∂rnson , you were on watch . Tell us what happened while the rest of the crew worked at the station ! - There 's not much to tell . - Why not ? Because nothing happened . Leave him alone ! I 'd like to see his reactions . Did you check the course after you came aboard ? - No , why should I ? - It 's not his job . And you didn 't make any special observations ? - You don 't remember anything ? - No ! And you can 't explain the programming of the wrong course ? I was sitting over there , and I never let the computer out of sight . Did you sleep when McLane called ? No , I was only drowsy . - I could see the console clearly . - And ? - And ? Nothing happened ! - But you were at the computer . - I guess so . - Why ? - Why ? Why ? I don 't know . - Really ? - What 's that supposed to mean ? - Exactly as I say . - Are you saying that ... ? - Yes I am , lieutenant Sigbj√∂rnson ! It 's quite clear . Why did you change course for AC-1000 ? - But I didn 't ! - Who else ? You were at the computer . You were the only one on board for 12 hours . It could only have been you , no one else . Aren 't you going too far ? I demand that ... I 'm in charge of the interrogation ! You might as well confess ! But I tell you ... You were going to give up the Orion to the enemy . An enemy entirely directed at the elimination of humanity . - That 's absurd ! - I 'll tell you what it is ! It 's treason ! Low and disgusting treason ! Don 't interrupt ! I know him better than myself . Who else could it be ? Aliens , perhaps the frogs ? Always the scape-goats , aren 't they ? You shouldn 't believe in alien intrigues . - Please Tamara ... - Get out of my way ! Lieutenant Jagellovsk to the log . I 've arrested Sigbj√∂rnson , suspected of sabotage , and for being a threat to the Earth 's security . - I 'm sorry , I must paralyze you . - Out of the question ! In compliance with regulation 59 , individuals suspected of sabotage must be paralyzed before the official investigation can begin . First , all weapons and the communicator must be seized . Your weapon , please ! Cliff , you can 't allow this ! We 've known him for ten years . Hasso , she can 't paralyze you that easily . Hasso is the worst criminal imaginable . He has ... There 's no evidence ! You only want to show off , and release your vanity and hatred . That 's beside the point ! You sacrifice an innocent man for your ambitions ! Lieutenant Legrelle , may I remind you that I 'm in command right now . I 'm always entitled to act against any tendencies of disloyalty . Sigbj√∂rnson 's guilt has been as good as proven . - On what grounds ? - He was the only one aboard . That 's not true . There was one more . Yourself , perhaps ? Cliff , before Hasso , there was someone else aboard . Alone and unattended , just as much a suspect as Hasso . - Who , Helga ? - Lieutenant Jagellovsk ! Yes , that 's right ! You were on watch before Hasso relieved you . Why wouldn 't you be a suspect ? The coordinates hadn 't been entered at that time . - Did you check ? - Is there a witness ? There isn 't ? Then McLane must arrest and paralyze you . - You wouldn 't dare ! - Do you think I 'm afraid of you ? - According to section 291 ... - Knock it off ! You 're as much of a suspect . It 's in your own best interest that the case is thoroughly investigated . - But I 'm the security officer . - What difference does it make ? Since McLane is reluctant to act : Give me your weapon ! - Before I give up my weapon ... - This gets us nowhere ! It 's no use suspecting one another for things we can 't explain . - It 's perfectly clear to me . - Not to me . Think about it ! The frogs ' coordinates were entered without orders . There are two suspects : Lieutenants Sigbj√∂rnson and Jagellovsk . If the only possibility is treason , then I would have had no objections . But remember the strange occurrences at M8-8-12 : The way the robots behaved , and the communications breakdown . Can 't that have other causes than treason ? Causes like ... - The same again . AC-1000 ! - I don 't get it . Soon we 'll all be traitors and deserters . It 's contagious ! We must go to the bottom of this . It 's now a case for a doctor . - Lieutenant Di Monti ? - Yes . - Do you understand me ? - Yes , of course . Do you know what just happened ? - When ? - A few minutes ago . Think hard ! I was standing by the computer and ... - Nothing more . - Are you sure ? You don 't remember entering coordinates ? - Who ? - You ! - Which ones ? - For AC-1000 ! - You accuse me of ... - No , I only ask if you remember . - I remember nothing . - What do you say now , commander ? Note that they were both standing at the computer while entering the course . - It can only be done from there . - They don 't remember it afterwards . - What 's your point ? - Don 't you see the connection ? Watch this ! Lieutenant Jagellovsk , would you please go to the computer ? - Why ? - Just an experiment . - You think that I too ... ? - Exactly ! - You 're in for a disappointment . - We 'll see ! Like I said . Well , Tamara . - Did I really ? - Yes . - It 's not possible . - I 'm afraid it is . Can you imagine Tamara as a traitor ? Neither can I. That 's why my hypothesis makes sense . We 're being controlled from the outside . - By whom ? - By the frogs , of course . They 've managed to break through the shielding of our computer . Using the computer , they can implant alien thought-patterns into our minds , so called telenosis . Telenosis ? What 's that ? The brain transmits waves similar to radio-waves . You can tap into the brain 's transmissions . A suitable transmitter would even let you control the brain from outside . Your own brain currents versus an alien , more powerful layer . - That never occured to us . - Some kind of hypnosis ? No , regular hypnosis uses real impressions , noises , or images . Telenosis affects the mind directly . So the enemy can make anyone do anything ? Even against your own sense of morality ? What do you know of morality ? That it 's the opposite of treason and collaboration with the frogs . Telenosis makes us defenceless . As soon as we 're in range of the beam from the computer , we 'll comply , whether we agree or not . Did they control the robots at M8-8-12 as well ? The entire station lies within the beam . They could have done anything to us . So why didn 't they ? They want us alive for our technical skills , and for Overkill . - And we 'll be prisoners at their central camp . - Where 's that ? At the origin of the telenosis beam . On AC-1000 ! So you must comply with the telenosis , enter the coordinates for AC-1000 , and head towards that mysterious planet ! Then Alonzo Pietro was no deserter . No , not more than we are . - So let 's desert ! - Excuse me ? Not for real . We 'll only pretend defecting to the frogs . - As if we 've taken their bate . - Yes , we 'd " love to give up Orion " ! Then we 'll ignite Overkill ! OK . Stand by for desertion ! - Shouldn 't we inform space command ? - How ? Olaf 1 and H5 don 't respond . Besides , the frogs might decode the message . As soon as some border station picks up our course , we 'll have the entire space fleet at our throats . That 's a risk I 'll have to take . Sir ! The space surveillance reports something terrible . - Orion 8 is heading for AC-1000 . - Let me see ! Alpha-message . To the government , the supreme council , space command , space patrol , staff of defence , and all intelligence authorities . Orion 8 under major McLane is presently escaping to alien territories . I ask your consent for launching operation ATAX . Then all space cruisers in neighboring sectors of Vesta will be ordered to change course and eliminate the Orion 8 . Orion 8 is escaping to alien territories . Her coordinates are AC17-23 . I repeat : AC17-23 . The ship must be intercepted at sector AC17-11 ! All ships must immediately head for AC17-11 ! Alpha-order from space command to armed forces in the Vesta area : Head for AC17-11 ! - Has anyone tried hailing the Orion ? - Yes . No response . - Olaf 1 ? - Neither Olaf 1 nor H5 respond . - Perhaps they 're out of power ? - Impossible . If only I knew what 's happened . - ATAX confirmed by all armed forces . - McLane can 't be a deserter . Intelligence has undeniable evidence . The satellite Argos in Vesta 5-61 has recorded Orion 's course . Then he 's lost it ... Which scout ship is closest to AC17-23 ? The Laura in sector AF12-90 . She 'll be there in three days . She 's presently at AX19 . If any ship can catch up with the Orion , it 's the Hydra under general van Dyke . Open a lightwave channel to the Hydra ! Channel open ! Space command calling general Lydia van Dyke . You must immediately set a course for AC17-11 ! Use hyperspace plus auxiliary power ! The Orion is heading for AC-1000 . She 's to be annihilated without warning ! Hydra here , but what about McLane ? You can 't just shoot him down . The Orion must be intercepted and annihilated . If not , there will be a disaster . Understood ? They 'll surely have a ball . Commander to the astrogator : New heading AC17-11 ! AC17-11 ! Commander to engineering : Hyperspace plus auxiliary ! Commander to the weapons console : Light throwers on standby ! - How does it look ? - It might work . If the Hydra can make it to sector 751 in 5 hours , we 'll be there first . - And if not ? - Orion will escape to the frogs . And we mustn 't get our hands dirty . The worst assignment of my life . - Traitors like McLane must ... - Nobody asked you ! We 're being hailed ! Argos to the Hydra ! - Calling the commander of the Hydra ! - Speaking ! Space station H5 and satellite Olaf 1 have been annihilated . All installations have been completely destroyed . The cause of the disaster hasn 't yet been determined . Over and out ! Probably destroyed by McLane to cover his escape to the frogs . Careful , professor ! We don 't want you to stumble and fall . - The hydrophone ? - No , the amplifier . - So Overkill can be ignited from here ? - Yes , via the computer . Normally it takes full control . - But I 'll bypass the automation . - Why ? The enemy listens in . They 've got one ear at our computer . They must be kept sure that we do intend to land on AC-1000 . So we can 't let the computer ignite Overkill . That would tip off the enemy . - Will you ignite it yourself ? - No , Hasso will . On my command . Sir , we 've got company ! Cliff , we can see four of the frogs ' vessels on the screen . - Can we use our light-throwers ? - Be serious ! Remember , we 're supposed to be mindless fools . We mustn 't react at all . Understood , Atan ? Cliff , there are now seven of them ! - There ! I 'd love to ... - Yes , but be patient ! We 'll take them out when they least expect it ! How far to go ? At our present speed , one hour to AC17-11 . Let 's switch off auxiliary power . No use arriving earlier than ordered . - We are to use any means necessary ... - I know ! But I don 't need lessons on how to interpret orders . Besides , I expect to see an old friend bite the dust . Commander to engineering : Switch off auxiliary power ! - General van Dyke , that 's ... - Just say it ! Space surveillance to the commander : UFOs coming straight at us ! - Radio contact ? - No response . Their mission appears to be to block off sector AC17-11 . Sir , you must give orders to fire at will ! It 's no use . Their weapons are far superior to ours . Commander to engineering : Hyperspace plus auxiliary power ! Return to Earth ! Sir , you 're ... Completely mad ! I know . And I repeat : Return to Earth ! Would you please compute the radius of our orbit ? 960,000 . Main heading remains unchanged . Impulse received ! Enemy base sighted ! Activate resonance contact ! - How many vessels do you see ? - 22 . Commander to weapons console . - Are you ready , Mario ? - Frequencies are set . Hasso 's entire energy reserve will power Overkill for four seconds . Engineering to the commander . Power transfer to weapons systems . Overkill plus four . Overkill plus five . Auxiliary propulsion only . Tamara ! Take over at space surveillance ! Overkill plus six . Magnetic shields and heat shields on . Understood ? Can intelligence officers do that ? She 's learning , and sometimes things turn out quite well . Cliff , they 're coming closer ! Distance 1,000 ! We must fire ! The order stands ! Keep calm ! There 's the base , Cliff ! - Distance ? - 384,000 kilometers . So far so good . Stand by for Overkill ! Their base has been destroyed . The telenosis beam is gone . Ultra impulse and the Orion in transfer ellipse . We 've been hit ! - Generators 3 and 4 are out . - Overkill on automatic ! Program as fast as you can ! Reinforce the magnetic shields and try to ... They 're attacking relentlessly ! Targets spotted and identified ! Attention - Overkill ! My congratulations once more ! - If you knew what I 've been through ! - I can imagine . If I could issue orders by telenosis , there would be no more detours . Then I 'd have to do life in jail . May I have the next dance ? With pleasure ! Look at that ! Look ! - I thought you had something against me . - What would that be ? Oh , you mean since you were right after all ? Do you think I 'm that ambitious ? - She 's made quite an impression on you . - Who ? Oh . She 's not too bad . Aren 't you afraid I might desert as well ? - Would you do that ? - In a minute ! I must report that to our security officer . She can 't take a joke . Cliff , you 're a bastard ! Tell me , does telenosis have any side effects ? Yes , at long exposures . - If it 's brief , then ? - The effects wear off quickly . I 've a feeling that they 've only just begun for some .

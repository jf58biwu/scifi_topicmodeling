 Um ... do you come here often ? Hey there , I couldn 't be in the wrong place , could I ? No , this is a disabled war veterans recreation centre , isn 't it ? Just ... Oh , ridiculous . Oh , what 's the use ? It never works out . Who needs it ? Do I need it ? Every week I come here . Every week , exactly the same thing . You come looking for a little companionship , a little affection , even . And what do you get ? Speechless idiots , every single time . Forget it . Forget it . There 's nothing you can do . I 've seen it all . Believe me . Ah ... Every single week I ask them , " Couldn 't you for once pair me up with somebody interesting ? " And they smile that patronising smile and say , " All you young fellows have something in common , haven 't you ? " And they always put me with somebody like you . And I always ask , " Um ... " - I always put in the " um " . " Um ... do you come here often ? " Then I pretend that I think I might be in the wrong place ... " This is the disabled war veterans recreation centre , isn 't it ? " Ridiculous ! I 've had it . I 'm never coming here again , believe me . Tendrils . What ? Tendrils . Tendrils ? Oh God , you really must have had a rough time . I 've seen some pretty bad ones . From the drain ? No , Jesus ! I hope you realise you 're sitting at the drain end of the tub . - So ? - I advise you to put the plug in . Why should I ? They always turn the water off when the veterans visit the centre . Don 't you have a place to take a bath at home ? Not keeping from going down the drain . For keeping them from coming up . What kind of things come up drains ? - I told you . - Tendrils ? Do you mean like plants growing up ? Like plants . Like plants . From this drain ? - From any drain . - Change places with me . God , no , I didn 't tell you to sit there , did I ? You 've been sitting at that end since you got here . Now it 's my turn . What 's the matter ? Nothing . Oh , never mind . Just never mind . I was only kidding . I really didn 't want to change places . God forbid I should manage a little happiness for myself . A little positive response from another human being . Obviously you came out of the war in a lot worse shape than I did . I shouldn 't complain . Oh no . Really , I shouldn 't complain . I 'm clinically all right , there 's nothing wrong with me . You 're all right like I 'm all right . No , seriously , there 's absolutely nothing wrong with me . What are you doing here then ? I 'm the centre 's recreational programme director . Seriously , my only purpose is to keep our boys - who have done such a fine job - amused and happy . - Really ? - Really . Oh , Christ ! That 's disgusting ! That 's so bloody artificial . Come here looking for a little genuine community of interest and what do they give you ? A plastic playmate who tries to keep you amused by talking about plants growing out from drains . Not plants . I never said plants . Just like plants is what I said . Are you still sticking to that ridiculous ... ? That reminds me , what time is it ? Twenty to ten . Why ? Really ? Do you like this thing wrapping around your ankles ? - Anything like that ? - What ? No ! What are you talking about ? Are you the recreation director ? Absolutely ridiculous ! Never again ! If I have to sit all alone in my room with my medals - that will do , believe me . I don 't have to come to this mad house . I 've got plenty I can do by myself . Recreation director , my ass . - Wait ... - Oh ... - Did you hear that ? - Uh ... - A kind of scraping . - No . I was in the Chemical and Biological Warfare Ministry during the war . I know what I 'm talking about . I know how many mistakes , accidents , underestimations ... Is this another one of your ... ? I know how many strange deaths how many strange creatures with heart and blood ... Ah ! There , in the drain , just below the filter valve . I don 't want to see ! I 'll be all right , just as long as I stay over here . See that ? See how scared you got when I pretended to play your game ? - Incredible ! - What are you talking about ? Don 't you understand ? I am the new recreational programme director . - You 've got to be kidding ? - Oh no ! Seriously . You 're going down the drain . Come on , there 's nothing to hurt you in there . It 's all in your head . Nothing ever comes from the drain . It always comes from the deep end of your mind . I 've been briefed about you and they asked me to do some work with you . Really ? Of course . I 've never been in the war myself . Tell me honestly , do I look the type ? Well ... Seriously , tell me ! - You 've got to change places with me . - No ! Come on now , you 're just reacting automatically . I 'm ringing the bell and you 're the dog salivating in anticipation of a meal . You better break out of that straight jacket you 're in . Come on , let 's change places . Just leave it . I had to feel you out , see where you were in your mind before I could make a definite move to help you . Now , come on . That 's it . That 's it . Just sit down , take a peek at the drain . There 's nothing thereto hurt you . Soon it 'll be all over . For me . That 's it . Go on .

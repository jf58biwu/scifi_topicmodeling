 - Tired , sir ? - Yep , I 'm tired . You should be after 24 hours with no sleep . If I just knew what you were looking for- - It 's a sighting I investigated before you got here , similar to the Vincent report . Perkins or Prescott , something that started with a P. - I 'll know it when I see it . Yeah . - P section , right here , sir . It 's not here . Sergeant , I don 't understand this . Last month the Ambrose report was missing , and now this . Now , these files are your responsibility . I don 't understand it either , sir . Maybe you forgot to unpack it . Go upstairs . See if you can find it . We 've got to have it for the committee meeting . Yes , sir . [ DOOR OPENS ] - Captain Ross ? - Yeah , what are you doing here ? Captain Gardner would like to see you , sir . - Now ? - He says it 's urgent , sir . Twelve midnight ? Look . You just tell Captain Gardner I 'll see him as soon as I can . You 'll come now ... sir . - What is this ? - Don 't argue , captain . Just come now . Can I , uh , get my , uh , briefcase ? Get your briefcase . [ GUNSHOTS ] - Captain ? - Watch it ! Behind the files . ANNOUNCER : The Invaders . A Quinn Martin Production . Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . NARRATOR : The invaders . Alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination : the Earth . Their purpose : to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road , looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . ANNOUNCER : The guest stars in tonight 's story : William Smithers , Patricia Smith , Katherine Justice , and special guest star Michael Rennie . Tonight 's episode , " The Innocent . " NARRATOR : In a decaying lobster port in Maine , David Vincent searches for a man who has seen the invaders . A fisherman named Nat Greely , who has taken one of their weapons : a strange metallic disc . For a day and a half , Vincent has combed the tiny waterfront town , but Nat Greely has disappeared . DAVID : Looking for someone ? - David Vincent ? Yes , that 's right . We had a pretty rough time finding you , Mr. Vincent . You 're wanted in Washington . - Who wants me ? - Captain Ross , Project Hawk . - Look- - - Uh , Mr. Vincent , we know what you 're looking for . We also know who you 're looking for . And , uh ... that 's a subpoena . Supposing I wanna stay here and finish what I- - We have a plane waiting for you at the airport . Follow me in that car , if you will . DAVID : All right . - Thank you . [ CAR STARTS ] [ DAVID 'S CAR STARTS ] Oh , yeah , when they die , they vanish . They burn , just like that . DAVID : How many times you gonna ask me that ? And why the third degree ? What 's your reason ? It 's happened to somebody else . - Somebody else has seen it . - What makes you think that ? DAVID : It 's the one thing you keep coming back to , how they die . You 've seen it . All right , I 've seen it , so what ? Have you heard of the Peterson Committee ? - No . - Peterson , the office of defence , they 've asked him to form a committee to look into my findings . Now , the hearings start Monday . I 'll have to be there , of course , with the Project Hawk reports . I want you there too , to testify . You want me to testify ? You know , I 've given up my life to fight them . My girl . My business . My plans . There 's a valley in California I once dreamt of developing . I 've been down this road before . I 've written , I 've talked , I 've phoned , I 've seen senators , congressmen . I 'll testify . But if I do get up there and tell everything I know , under oath , what makes you think they 'll believe me ? Don 't you understand ? There are two of us this time . Two of us who have actually seen ' em . That 's a lot of words , a lot of talk . What we need is proof . Now , the man I 'm looking for is in Maine . He can give us that proof . Nat Greely is the town drunk , the town bum . His testimony wouldn 't be worth two cents . That 's why we dropped the whole thing with him . We need you here to testify . If you think he 's that important , I 'll send a couple of men to find him . Do that , and he 'll never come out of hiding . I know how frightened a man like this can get . Now , let me do it my way . Please . MAN 1 : Hi , son . Hey , you putting out to sea in that whaler ? Whaler 's got a square hull . This here 's a Kettenburg . No good to nobody . Pa stove it in when he was drunk . Ma . Ma . MAN 1 : Ms. Greely ? Hi . Mr. Greely onboard ? Oh , I should introduce myself . My name is Calvin Adams . My partner , Ed Poole . We practise law in Augusta . My husband isn 't here . What do you want , mister ? Ms. Greely , if what we found in the county records is right , your husband 's the last living descendant of the Berkitts . Here you go . And if your husband can prove it , he 'll be $ 83,000 richer . - Eighty-three thousand dollars ? MAN 2 : That 's right . You just wait a minute . The only thing Nat 's mother 's family had to pass on to their kids was a liking for liquor . [ MAN 2 CHUCKLES ] Maybe so , but your husband 's great uncle ran up a small fortune fishing out in Oregon . He never had but one great uncle , Sam Berkitt . That 's the man . Sam Berkitt ? Uh-huh . Mrs. Greely , it 's taken so long tracing down these records that we 've no time to waste . Now , if we can 't find your husband , all that money stands to go the Sailors ' Fund . Now , Mrs. Greely , now , where can we find your husband ? When he comes back , I 'll tell him about it . Now , I got work to do . Get down from there , Natty . MAN 1 : But , Mrs. Greely- - - Goodbye , mister . Natty . Ma ? They said we 'd be rich . We 'll be rich when it rains $ 10 gold pieces . - What 's wrong , Ma ? - Nothing . Those two , they must 've been some of your father 's worthless friends playing a joke . Your great Uncle Sam died when he was 14 . The record 's right here in the family bible . The only thing he got out in Oregon was the fever that killed him . Now , I gotta get ashore . And you don 't say nothing , hear ? Mrs. Greely , I 'm David Vincent . I was here yesterday . I don 't care who you say you are , mister . I 've got somewheres to go , and I 'm late . To see your husband ? Where is he , Mrs. Greely ? He 's in danger . I can help him . All right , you don 't have to tell me where he is . If you wanna save your husband , you better persuade him to see me . Just call this man . He 'll tell you who I am . - The Air Force ? - Yes . Please call him . All right , Mr. Vincent . I 'll call him , but I don 't promise nothing . You wait in there , Natty . Go on . [ BELL DINGS ] Operator , I wanna put in a long-distance call . - Who are you ? - David Vincent . How do I know that ? Your wife called . She told you who I am . She told me your name and that you checked out with the Air Force . How are you gonna save my life ? I know what you 've been going through , and I know why . That disc you found is one of their weapons . That 's what they 're after . That 's why they tried to kill you . - Who do you mean , " they " ? - You saw them get off a spaceship . What do you think ? - They 're men , like me . - They look like men . Now , Nat , where 's the disc ? - I haven 't got it . - You what ? When they tried to kill me , I hid it . Well , where ? Show me . I ain 't leaving here until nobody 's looking for me no more . Until they 're gone . Nat , we need that disc to convince the government that they 're here . Now . Today . If these invaders aren 't stopped , not only your life is in danger , but everybody 's . Now , please , where 's the disc ? Well , I guess I can 't be worse off than I am now . I just wanna be quit of this whole business . There 's a wharf at the foot of Grover Street . You meet me there at 6 : 00 . After it 's dark . Now , get out of here . Mommy , Mommy . Those two men , they 're back . - Okay , get up here , Natty . - I 'll go get help . Natty . Mrs. Greely , I 'm sorry to intrude again , but there are a few things we are going to have to settle . [ GASPS ] This concerns you too , young fella . [ SOFTLY ] Nat , come down . - What are you doing here ? - Hurry up . Come down . - Are you sure you weren 't followed ? - I don 't care if I was . Nat . Nat , listen . You 're not gonna meet that Mr. Vincent , do you hear me out ? - What happened ? You told me- - - I was wrong . Do you understand ? I was wrong . I understand that if I give Mr. Vincent that metal disc , - we 're quit of this once and for all . - You can 't . You can 't do that . They come , two of them . - They ? - Two of them . - They come and- - - What ? What ? What ? Oh , Nat , all I ever needed was a little peace . I just wanted a little money . Maybe I pushed you some . - And I yelled at you . - Edna , Edna , Edna . What did they do ? What do they want ? That disc . They said you gotta give them that disc . And they said they- - They want Mr. Vincent too . You gotta do it , Nat . You just got to . I don 't have the disc . I said they want Mr. Vincent too . They mean it , Nat . They 're not fooling . I told you . Know what 's gonna happen to everybody on this Earth - if they ain 't stopped ? - I don 't care about anybody . I only care about us , you and me and Natty . And if you don 't give them Mr. Vincent , they 're gonna kill us all . You and me and Natty . [ CAR DOOR OPENS ] [ CAR DOOR CLOSES ] [ GRUNTING ] This is a great pleasure , Mr. Vincent . Thank you , gentlemen . Thank you , Mr. Greely . You did splendidly . - So you 're one of them ? MAN : No , no , Mr. Vincent . He 's been useful though , in returning our property and delivering you . We 're most appreciative . Will you wait inside , Mr. Greely ? Wha- - ? We 'll make you comfortable . Mr. Vincent , I 'd like you to come with me . I want to show you something . [ DOOR OPENS ] Would you care to inspect our spaceship , Mr. Vincent ? What do you want ? Why don 't you take off your overcoat ? You won 't be needing it . If you 'll sit down , I 'll explain to you . There 's nothing to be afraid of . I know how you feel about us , Mr. Vincent . I don 't blame you . We 've committed blunders too , many of them . We 've used terror , violence , we 've even killed . But the history of your people is full of those same blunders . What happens when one civilisation finds another less advanced ? We 've learned , Mr. Vincent , at great cost to you and us . Now we have our orders . It 's got to stop . We want to take the fist step , Mr. Vincent . We want to show you you 've nothing to fear anymore . We 're here to help , to contribute our knowledge to your lives . But it 's useless just to say that . We want you to come with us and see how we can help one another . - Where ? - It 's a short trip . It 'll only take a few minutes . That is for your safety , Mr. Vincent . This mode of travel is suited to us , our makeup . Protective padding is for your protection against the force of our acceleration and the speed of our flight . When we take off , there may be some discomfort . It 's only fair to warn you , you may even lose consciousness . However , if you do , it will only be momentary . Unpleasant , but quite harmless . [ SPACESHIP WHIRRING ] Are you all right , Mr. Vincent ? Yes . You did lose consciousness . - How long ? - Not long . It was a short flight . - Can you stand ? - I think so . [ DAVID SIGHS ] You better rest a while . We have a surprise for you , Mr. Vincent . What is the place you 've always missed ? The place you always wanted to see ? The place you hoped would hold the key to your future happiness ? The place that was a valley until a drought came and left it a desert ? I hope we 've chosen properly , Mr. Vincent . - Santa Margaretta Valley . - Yes . Shall we go , Mr. Vincent ? DAVID : It is Santa Margaretta . Look what we 've done to it , Mr. Vincent . It was dying . How did you do that ? It was a problem , but we conquered it . There 's much more to see , Mr. Vincent . The car waiting is for us . Our architect 's building . Do you like the changes , Mr. Vincent ? It 's beautiful . Have we measured up to the ambitions you once had - for the Santa Margaretta Valley ? - Yes , you have . You certainly have . Wait a minute . - How did you do this without water ? - That such a problem ? We often talked about building a dam up in the canyon . We were told that was impossible . Nothing 's impossible , Mr. Vincent . Not with our knowledge . We 've already built a smaller dam , a larger one is under construction . But every engineer I 've ever talked to said it was impossible . - Everyone ? - All but Billy Stearns , but his ideas were so far out , couldn 't get financial backing . This will interest you , Mr. Vincent . [ INDISTINCT CHATTER ] Billy . - David . - Billy . Billy Stearns . They told me you we 're coming . I didn 't believe them . You mean you knew I was coming ? Well , what are you doing here , anyway ? [ CHUCKLING ] I 'm working for them . You think I sold out . Well , you know me better than that . Then why ? I fought them too , at first , until he made me understand . David , the knowledge . Now , look at that building . Now , the material in that building is what we 've been looking for since college . I would stand the stress a dam a mile high would create . I understand you 're building it right now . Can I see it ? - Does he have time ? - If that 's what you want . - I 've gotta see it . - Now , let me make a call , then you meet me on the other side of the building , okay ? His leg , he 's not limping . Injury , disability , those are human concepts , Mr. Vincent . You mean you can work miracles like that ? We can do whatever you want . Frankly , Santa Margaretta is an experiment , Mr. Vincent . Putting ourselves in your place , finding out what your needs are . WOMAN : David ! David ! Helen . - Oh , Helen . - Ha , ha , ha . - I didn 't think you 'd remember . - How could I forget ? - It was such a long time ago . - I haven 't forgotten . I 'll leave you two alone . I 'll find you later . Come on , Dave . I 'll drive . [ ENGINE STARTS ] Now , I have to tell you , I don 't understand any of this . - Well , how can I help you ? - I don 't know . This town , what they 've done to it ... And Billy working here , now you ... It 's a different world , isn 't it , David ? - It 's unbelievable . - Oh , no , very believable . A world where what we want most can be accomplished . David , they can teach us how to- - How to get what we want . They can teach us how to not let human emotions get in the way of what we want . That 's what happened to us , isn 't it ? We didn 't think clearly . We were so in love , everything was an emotional crisis . David , stay with me . I have a house at the lake . We can spend the morning swimming , and I 'll mix us some drinks . David . David , what 's the matter ? Sorry . Something 's wrong . What is it ? I can help you . The town . This whole valley . What 's the matter ? The dam . Why wasn 't the dam in the newspaper ? It 's all so new . There hasn 't been time . - You 're lying to me . Why ? - David , I 'm not lying to you . I want an answer . Why ? David , it 's just you and I. That 's all there is now . You 're married . You 're in England . David , forget all that . It 's all in the past . I was here only a month ago . There was nothing . No building . No dam . David , you 're ill . The flight was too much for you . No . There 's something wrong . David , listen to me . - It 's wrong . - David , it 's just us . We 're real . We 're now . That 's all that matters , David . - All that matters . - It 's wrong . David , listen to me . Look at me , David . David . It 's wrong . - David . Stay with me , David . - It 's all wrong . - David . - It 's wrong . - Magnus ! - It 's wrong . Magnus ! Magnus ! Magnus ! Magnus ! Magnus ! Magnus ! MAGNUS : Stay with us , Mr. Vincent . Stay with us , Mr. Vincent . Stay with us , Mr. Vincent . Stay with us , Mr. Vincent . Stay with us , Mr. Vincent . Stay with us , Mr. Vincent . No . - It 's wrong . - Stay with us , Mr. Vincent . It 's wrong . - Stay with us , Mr. Vincent . - It 's wrong . Mr. Vincent , stay with us . None of it was real . It was all in my mind . It would have all been so easy , if only you 'd cooperated . But we will still do what has to be done . However , this time , it will be done a little differently . [ ENGINE STARTS ] MAGNUS : There was a plane waiting for you at the Augusta Airport . By now , Captain Ross has the report that neither you nor Mr. Greely showed up . - What if he has men looking for me ? - He doesn 't . Not yet . - How do you know ? - I want you to call Captain Ross . I want you to tell him what you would 've told him voluntarily if we 'd convinced you . What would I have said ? That you know nothing about us or our activities . That we exist only in your imagination . Is that why you tried to brainwash me , so I 'd believe that you were here for the benefit of mankind ? Call him . You 're afraid of the Peterson Committee . And what they 'll find out if they begin to investigate . I 'll ask you once more to call him . You 're afraid of my testimony . You 're in danger . Do you really think I 'll make that phone call ? Yes , Mr. Vincent . Mr. Greely , would you tell Mr. Vincent what you 've just found out ? They 're gonna kill my wife and boy ... unless we do something that they want . They said that you would tell me what . - You do understand ? - Yes . Now , will you make the call ? What call ? They 're trading your family for a phone call . Well , you 're just sitting there . Make the call . If I do , the investigation goes to pieces . They continue safely with their plan . They 're talking about my wife and my boy . You 're gonna make that call . Please . Please . [ NAT SOBBING ] You may get Captain Ross . Captain Ross please . - Captain Ross , this is David Vincent . - Where are you ? You 'd never believe it . Well , what happened ? Did you find Greely ? I found him . Well , stop playing games . Tell me what happened . We didn 't find out anything . Scratch us off your list . You 'll have to appear before the committee without our testimony . What ? I said , Greely and I know nothing . There are no aliens , there never have been . It was all for publicity . What are you trying to pull ? You know I 've seen one of them myself . Vincent , are you in some kind of trouble ? The only one in trouble is you . Now , Vincent , I want you here in my office . I need you when I go up before that committee , - whether we have Greely or not . - I 'm sorry . - Vincent- - - Goodbye . Vincent . Thank you , Mr. Vincent . Shall we get on with it ? You really must be very anxious to die , Mr. Vincent . You 're always pushing so hard . Now , Mr. Magnus , you said , uh , if we did what you asked , I could- - You 're free , Mr. Greely . Mr. Vincent , I wouldn 't have done this except to save my wife and kid . I 've never done much for them . I couldn 't let them be killed . They won 't hurt you . They promised me . Have a drink , Mr. Vincent . [ DAVID GROANING ] I think that I can find the way to the highway myself . That won 't be necessary , Mr. Greely . We 've provided a car for you . [ DAVID SPITTING ] [ DAVID GROANS ] Goodbye , Mr. Vincent . Nat . Nat . [ TIRES SCREECHING ] [ TIRES SCREECHING ] [ CAR EXPLODES ] ROSS : What do you expect me to believe ? You call and tell me it 's all a fairy tale , then you come in here with a song and dance about brainwashing and a flying saucer . Let me talk to the Peterson Commission . Now , you go ahead and talk to them . After you called , I told them that our star witness had just discredited himself . We had no proof . Go ahead . Give them a few laughs . Tell them about your trip to Venus , or wherever it was . Then send some men up to that mansion . You 'll find proof . I 've got news for you , Vincent . After your call from the hospital , I sent some men up to the mansion . They found nothing . So why don 't you and your drinking buddy go find yourself another bar ? [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Come in . If you don 't need me , I 'll go down and clean up the Project Hawk files . ROSS : Yeah , go ahead . Sooner the better . I guess that about does it , Vincent , unless you 'd like to favour me with a few more of your stories . Sergeant Ruddell . Ruddell was there . He was on that ship . - Sergeant Ruddell , huh ? - He was there . Get out of here . Let me have Security . This is Captain Ross . I want you to make a check for me . Ruddell . Sergeant Ruddell . Yeah , I know you 've already run one . I want you to run another one . I wanna know everything about him , and I mean everything , from the day he was born . NARRATOR : A trip to a nightmare world . A committee disbanded . Another defeat . Another hope lost for David Vincent . Maybe . Or maybe it 's a hope begun .

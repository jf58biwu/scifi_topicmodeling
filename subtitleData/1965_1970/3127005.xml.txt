Novels , biographies , Adventure stories . Oh , routine , eh ? Why will they do it ? It 's sheer perversity . By the way ... Pass it over . What does montag do With his day off duty ? Not very much , sir . Mow the lawn . And what if the law Forbids that ? Just watch it grow , sir . Uh-huh . Good . Good . Montag might be Hearing some exciting news In a day or two . Benedict won 't be with us Very much longer , And montag 's name Has been mentioned . Promotion , sir ? I trust that the thought Makes montag happy . I think we 're neighbors . I live near block 813 . Isn 't that Where you live ? Yes , i do . Do you know we make The same trip together Almost every day ? Do we ? Hmm . That 's why I thought to myself , Well , we ought To talk to each other . Do you mind ? Me talking , i mean . No , no , go ahead . Talk . I can 't promise To think of anything To answer though . Don 't worry about that . Once i get started , Nothing can stop me . My uncle says i am A veritable well of words . Has this uncle of yours Ever warned you never To speak to strangers ? No . He did say once if anyone Asked how old i was ... To say i was 20 years old And light in the head . They always go together . " light in the head " ? Mmm . Loopy . Crazy . Anyway , You don 't frighten me . Why should i ? No reason really . The uniform , i suppose . Most people are ... Frightened , Frightened of firemen . This is my stop now . Mine too .

Oh , fahrenheit 451 . Why 451 rather than 813 or 121 ? Fahrenheit 451 Is the temperature At which ... Book paper catches fire And starts to burn . I 'd like to ask you Something else , only I don 't really dare . Go ahead . Is it true ... That a long time ago ... Firemen used to put out fires And not burn books ? Really , your uncle Is right . You are Light in the head . " put fires out " ? Who told you that ? I don 't know . Someone . But is it true ? What a strange idea . Houses have always Been fireproof . Ours isn 't . Well , then , It should be condemned One of these days . It has to be destroyed , And you will have to move ... To a house That is fireproof . Too bad . Tell me , Why do you burn books ? What ? Well , it 's a job Like any other . Good work with lots Of variety . Monday , we burn miller ; Tuesday , tolstoy ; Wednesday , walt whitman ; Friday , faulkner ; And saturday and sunday , Schopenhauer and satre . " we burn them to ashes And then burn the ashes . " That 's our Official motto . You don 't like books then ? Do you like the rain ? Yes , i adore it . Books are just So much ... Rubbish . They have no interest . Then why do some people Still read them although It 's so dangerous ? Precisely because It is forbidden . Why is it forbidden ? Because it makes People unhappy . Do you really Believe that ? Oh , yes . Books Disturb people . They make them Antisocial . Do you think I 'm antisocial ? Why do you ask ? Well ... I 'm a teacher . Well , not quite . I 'm still on probation . This afternoon The analyst called me in , And i don 't think I said the right things . I 'm not at all happy About my answers . That 's probably why I 've been so rude to you . Have i been annoying you ? Oh , no , Not at all . In fact , i was questioned This afternoon as well . I didn 't do Too well either . This is where i live . You see ? This is my house . One more question . Another one ? Just a tiny one . What is it ? Do you ever read The books you burn ? Why should i ? First , I 'm not interested . Second , i 've better Things to do .

How much ? He didn 't mention that . We could move To a larger house . Would you like that ? I 'd rather have A second wall-set put in . They say when you have Your second wall-screen , It 's like having Your family grow around you . Linda , how many of these pills Have you taken today ? What 's that ? Oh , those . Help yourself . I 've got another bottle . How many have you had ? Oh , don 't carry on Like that . Only a few . Anyway , Tonight 's special for me . I 've got a part inthe family . What ? Our campaign against the enemies Of the public peace ... Is gaining momentum . Today 's figures for operations In the urban area alone ... Account for the elimination Of the total ...

The cousin announcer . The one you don 't like . I don 't like Any of them . Why don 't you get The kitchen fixed ? You are awful . Oh , hurry , hurry ! I 'll be on in a minute ! Quickly ! Quickly ! ? [ tv theme I don 't understand . How can you be in a play ? They 've written a play With one part missing . That 's me . When the people look at me , Then i have to speak . They ask me a question , And i have to say what i think . The play , it 's beginning . And now , For cousins everywhere , Our family theater . " come play with us . " Naturally , in what You are about to see ... Any similarity with the truth Or with real life will be Purely coincidental . Do bear that in mind . So , willyou Come play with us ? You will ? Good ! I thought you would . Come in , cousins . Be one of the family . Charles , do you realize What a dilemma this is ? It 's terribly difficult . I don 't see any way out of it . Come , come , bernard . Of course there 's A way out . There are 13 of us So far , right ? You want To invite edward , Which makes 14 . But if somebody 's ill , Then we should be back To 13 again . Precisely . Then we must Invite more people . That 's an idea . What about Lottie and james ? That 'll make 16 . Then if somebody 's ill , At least we won 't be 13 . But then there 's The problem of the rooms . Freddie and little john . I don 't see any problem There at all . We can put The two children In helen 's room . What do you think , linda ? - go ahead . They 're waiting for you . - i think that ... You see ? Linda agrees with me . Lottie 's children must go in With helen 's children . Linda 's absolutely right . Then there 's the problem Of the seating , charles . I think i 've got something Worked out , though . Look . If we put yvonne at the head And richard at her right ... Oh , no , bernard . Richard isn 't even Speaking to yvonne . Oh ? Because of leslie . Oh ! Madeleine must be At the head . Besides , madeleine is older Than yvonne . She might even Be older than jacqueline . I see no problem there . We put madeleine at the head Of the table . It 's madeleine , Isn 't it , linda ? Absolutely . - if linda thinks It 's all right , it must be . There 's still the problem About the rooms . What rooms are left ? There 's the pink room . We could always put lilian In the pink room . We can put susan In the green room . Yes . Where can we put monica ? Yes , what can we do With monica ? Do you have The answer , linda ? In the blue room ? Linda , you 're right . She 's right . Linda , you 're Absolutely fantastic . You saw it , didn 't you ? I gave all the right answers . Wasn 't it wonderful ? I could have been an actress . Don 't you think so ? Think what ? That i could have been An actress . Oh , sure you could have Been an actress . I wonder whether joyce Was watching . I do hope so . I must ring her tomorrow And find out what she thought . How did you get The part ? The head Ofthe familyrang me up . Me ! And said i was to be In tonight 's play . Linda , they must have phoned Every one of 200,000 lindas In the whole country . That 's not true . I mean , even if it were true , You didn 't have to tell me . That was very mean . So you 're in for promotion , Montag . Good luck . Thank you . Well , well , What 's all this we hear , Montag ? Promotion , eh ? It seems so . How do you feel About it ? Happy ? The wife Rather likes the idea . I suppose . Hurry ! Attention ! That will do for today . Go back to your desks . What 's this ? I told you two I did not want to see you Sitting next to each other . Didn 't i make it clear enough The first time ? Yes , you ! You know what i mean . Come and sit here . Let us review Yesterday 's lesson . We studied how to detect Books hidden during the actual Construction of a house . This is somewhat rare Because it 's very costly ; For its floors , For its ceilings . We also studied concealment Inside furniture . Trainee firemen Stoneman and black are to report To captain 's office immediately . I repeat , trainee firemen Stoneman and black ... Are to report To the captain 's Office immediately . We were discussing Concealment inside furniture . The most prevalent form Being the false icebox Or the fake television set . What occasionally presents Problems are books hidden In small quantities ... In everyday objects . When one is looking for a book , The most common area Is to look for it ... In a rectangular object , Like a cigar box Or a chocolate box ... Or any other object In similar shape . I demonstrate how even A cylindrical object Can be used . Montag will report To the captain 's office . Here , you . Hand me a pile of books . While i 'm gone , give each Of the trainees a book . Each of you will hide His book somewhere In this classroom . When i return , i will give you A demonstration how to search . To learn how to find , One must first know how to hide . What shall i say ? We met by accident . That 's no good . What do you Want to say ? We planned it ? It was your idea . You 're the one Who thought of it . Shut up ! If we don 't tell him The same story , we 're ... Listen ... Let 's play this By ear . Montag , this will take About five minutes . Yes , sir . What time is it ? Uh ... 10 : 00 , sir . Get out ! This is The last time ! Get out ! Like gymnastics , Montag ? Yes , sir . And what about hockey ? Do you like hockey ? Yes , i do , sir . And golf ? Golf . Very much , sir . Hmm ? And football ? Wonderful , sir . Billiards ? Basketball ? Oh , they 're all Very fine sports , sir . Then increase the dosage . More sports for everyone , Hmm ? Strengthen the group spirit . Organize the fun . Hmm ? Just keep them busy , And you keep them happy . That 's what matters . Hmm ? Am i right ? Absolutely , sir . Well , shall we talk a little About this promotion of yours ? You have mentioned The possibility to your wife ? - yes , sir . - and her reaction ? She thought we might be able To have a second wall-screen . Oh , you only have The one wall converted . I see . These matters of promotion Are much more important To a married man , aren 't they ? I guess so , sir . Montag ... You have No children , i believe . No , sir . We have no children . Well , then , a commission Seems in order . I can 't see any reason offhand Why it shouldn 't go through . You understand , of course , With the new amendment To the law , we must expect To be worked really very hard . Very hard , indeed , Until we can arrange For new volunteers To be drafted . Yes , sir , i heard the men Talking about it . How long have you been with us ? For six years , sir . Yes , for six years . No , no , no , For five years , sir . For five years . Montag has one quality I appreciate greatly . He says very little . Have you seen My personal medallion ? It 's a remarkable likeness . You must remind me to let you Have one sometime . Now , let 's get back To this promotion of yours . I 've been looking Through your file . There are only six back views . We need 12 of them , you know . Two sets of six . Remember that , montag .

Right . Stay close to her . The ambulance is on its way . Four minutes . What should i do In the meantime ? Nothing . Where is the doctor ? What doctor ? The doctor that Took care of my wife .

By a barrack gate . - what 's happened ? - you remember the analyst , How worried i was ? Mm-hmm . I was right to be worried . I 've been dismissed . Why ? What reason Did they give ? None at all . Just an official call . Services no longer required . I 'm never to go To the school anymore . They must give you a reason . Make them tell you why . Go to the school and ask . I can 't do that . Anyway , who knows What they may have said About me to the children . Strange . I wonder what you said That made the analyst ... Don 't you have any idea ? Something you said or did ? I never did Get on well with the staff . They disapprove of me . I don 't always stick To the timetable and ... We have fun in my classes , And they don 't like that . There was another teacher , The one i replaced . The same thing happened to her . They didn 't like her either . Now she 's in some awful kind Of trouble . Then it wasn 't The analyst .

" because i 'd be ashamed Of myself . " Ashamed of myself . " it was a little After half past 11 : 00 . " - what are you doing , linda ? - i found these things In the house .

When did we meet For the first time ? I don 't know . Let me think . No , i really Can 't remember . Oh , that 's rather sad . Don 't you think ? I do . I think it 's very sad . Behind each of these Books , there 's a man . That 's what interests me . So leave them alone And go back to bed . I can 't sleep . You have your pills , Haven 't you ? " rhinoceros : " any of certain large , powerful , " thick-skinned Perissodactyl mammals ... " of the family ... Rhinocerotidae . " Well , Look who 's here . What about it ? I thought you were On sick leave . Sick leave ? Who gave you that idea ? I don 't remember . I must have got it wrong . Hurry up . Montag , you 've Forgotten your helmet . What 's this , montag ?

" we shall this day light such A candle , by god 's grace ... As i trust shall Never be put out . " The police haven 't Done their job very well . Who is this woman ? What is she doing here ? Well , she 's certainly Worth looking at anyway . Police arrested the family This morning , sir . She must have been out . Where are the books ? If you didn 't know that , You wouldn 't be here . Upstairs . Montag , You stay here . Hey ! You two , in there ! In there . Go on . - down there ! Throw them all down ! Break it open ! That 's it . This way ! Come on ! Down there ! Throw them all down ! All the books ! All of them ! This way ! Come on ! " once upon a time , There was a poor woodcutter Whose name was ... " They can 't have My books . They 'll Never take them away . Montag , i think You should see this . Yes , sir . Come on ! Quickly ! This is a real eyeful . Ah , montag . I knew it . I knew it . Of course , all this ... The existence of a secret ... Library was known In high places , But there was no way Of getting at it . Only once before have i seen So many books in one place . I was just An ordinary fireman At the time . I wasn 't even qualified To use the flamethrower . It 's all ours , montag . Listen to me , montag . Once to each fireman , At least once in his career , He just itches To know what these Books are all about . He just aches to know . Isn 't that so ? Take my word for it , montag , There 's nothing there . The books have nothing To say ! Look , these are all novels . All about people That never existed . The people that read them , It makes them unhappy With their own lives , Makes them want To live in other ways That can never really be . What 's happening ? This house is condemned . They said to burn the books Here with everything else . Burning the house is one thing . Burning the books is another , Isn 't it ? It 's never any good Burning everything together . Come on , montag . All this philosophy , Let 's get rid of it . It 's even worse Than the novels . Thinkers , philosophers , All of them saying exactly The same thing : " only i am right . The others are all idiots . " One century , they tell you Man 's destiny is predetermined . The next , they say that He has freedom of choice . It 's just a matter Of fashion , that 's all . Philosophy . Just like Short dresses this year , Long dresses next year . Look . All stories of the dead . Biography that 's called . And autobiography . My life . My diary . My memoirs . My intimate memoirs . Of course , When they started out , It was just the urge to write . Then after the second or Third book , all they wanted Was to satisfy their own vanity , To stand out from the crowd , To be different , To be able to look down On all the others . Ah , critic 's prize . This is a good one . Of course , he had the critics On his side . Lucky fellow . Just tell me this , montag , At a guess , How many literary awards Were made in this country , On an average each year ? Five , ten , forty ? Hmm ? No less than 1,200 . Anybody that put Pen to paper was bound To win some prize someday . Ah , robinson crusoe . The negroes didn 't like that Because of his man , friday . And nietzsche . Ah , nietzsche . The jews didn 't like nietzsche . Now , here 's a book About lung cancer . All the cigarette smokers got Into a panic , so for everybody 's Peace of mind , we burn it . Ah , now this one Must be very profound . The ethics of aristotle . Now anybody that read that Must believe he 's a cut above Anybody that hadn 't . You see , it 's no good , montag . We 've all got to be alike . The only way to be happy is For everyone to be made equal . So , we must burn the books , Montag . All the books . Sir . Yes , what 's the matter ? Trouble with the old lady Downstairs . She won 't leave . She won 't leave her books , She says . She won 't leave her books , Won 't she ? Won 't she ? Come on now , madam . We 're gonna burn the house . No . What do you want ? Martyrdom ? I want to die as i 've lived . Oh , you must have Read that in there . I 'm not going To ask you again . Are you going ? These books were alive . They spoke to me . Go ahead . All right , That 's enough . Come on , Madam , you 've got ten seconds . Fabian , ten count . One . Two . Three . Four . Five . Six . Seven . Eight . - nine . - nine elevens are ninety-nine . Nine twelves Are a hundred and eight . Nine thirteens are a hundred And seventeen . She can 't stay here . She refuses to leave . Look out . She must be forced To leave . Back there ! Open up ! Everybody , outside ! Come on , You too , montag ! Montag ! Get out of there ! Montag ! Come on , this way ! Montag ! Montag ! Finally , Do remember to tolerate Your friends ' friends , However alien and peculiar They may seem to you . Don 't despise minorities . Doesn 't cousin midge 's Face look swollen ? That 's because She 's pregnant . Is that why ? I think it 's irresponsible To have children . Somebody 's got to have Children , jackie . They Can 't let the race die out . Babies grow up To look like you . That must be fun . Strangle violence . Suppress prejudice . Here 's montag . Be tolerant today . Being just pretty Is not enough . The wife who uses translusives Knows better than that . Try some today , but watch out For your friends ' husbands . They 'll be around you Like flies . No one will ever notice That your chairs don 't match , And you 'll be As popular as ever . Would you excuse me ? Yes , i like her hair Like this . Come on , montag , Be good now . Come on over and sit with us . You haven 't seen jackie And doris and helen for ages . It 's very rude , You know . Leave me alone . Aren 't you well ? All right , But it 's very naughty . ... are being reclassified . Two cells of antisocials Were located earlier today ... In the western Metropolitan area . The police have declined To comment so far . Meanwhile , the " report those Who threaten you " campaign ... Met with particular Success today ... When an old woman , cousins , Chose to be burned With her books rather than Being separated from them . If that 's a joke , It 's not in very good taste . You would like to think That , wouldn 't you ? Don 't be silly , montag . Things like that Don 't happen . You mean , you don 't Want to hear about it . I saw it ! My husband says ... Oh , your husband ! You don 't Even know where he is ! Montag ! Of course i know . He 's been called on reserve For some field training . Or to fight a little war . You never know , Do you ? Why do you Call it that ? Even if he was , What about it ? He 's not Allowed to call me Until it 's all over . It 'll only be About a week or two . He 'll be all right . The point about wars is , If you want to call Them that , It 's only other women 's Husbands who get killed . That 's true . I never knew anyone Who got killed in a ... Not anyone whose husband Died like that . Getting run over , Jumping out of a window , Yes . Like gloria 's husband A few nights ago . But never That other way . Anyway , that 's life , Isn 't it ? That 's what you call it . You 're nothing But zombies , all of you . Just like those husbands Of yours you don 't Even know anymore . You 're not living , You 're just killing time ! Well , i think It 's time to go . Yes , i ... Thank you . It was a lovely Afternoon . Really fun . Yes . Sit down ! - come on , sit down . It 'll only take a minute . - whatever is that ? Darling . It 's not a book ? That 's what it is . It 's a novel . Oh , it 's a book ! Oh , you mustn 't ! It 's against the law ! - quiet . Sit down and listen . - since montag really insists . But when he 's through , I hope we can do as we please . " there can be no disparity In marriage ... " like unsuitability Of mind and purpose . " i had endeavored To adapt dora to myself And found it impracticable . " it remained for me to adapt Myself to dora , to share with Her what i could and be happy . " it made my second year Much happier than my first , " and , what was better still , Made dora 's life all sunshine . " but as that year wore on , Dora was not strong . " i had hoped that lighter hands Than mine would help To mold her character ... " and that a baby 's smile Upon her breast might change My child-wife to a woman . " it was not to be . My pretty dora . " we thought she would be Running about as she used To do in a few days . " but they said wait A few days more , and then Wait a few days more , " and still she neither Ran nor walked . " i began to carry her Downstairs every morning And upstairs every night . " but sometimes when I took her up , i felt that She was lighter in my arms . " a dead , blank feeling Came upon me , " as if i were approaching Some frozen region ... " yet unseen That numbed my life . " i avoided direct recognition Of this feeling by any name , Over any communing with myself . " until one night when it was Very strong upon me ... " and my aunt had left her With her parting cry , " ' oh , good-bye , Little blossom . ' " i sat down at my desk , Alone , and tried to think . " oh , what a fatal name It was . " and how the blossom ... Withered in its bloom Up in the tree . " I knew that 's what would happen . It 's what i 've always said . Life isn 't like novels , Novels and tears , Novels and suicide . Novels are sick . That was sheer cruelty , montag . You 're a cruel man . All those words ; Idiotic words . Evil words That hurt people . Isn 't there enough Trouble as it is ? Why disturb people With that sort of filth ? Poor doris . Bye , linda . We were having Such a nice party . Such a shame . I can 't bear To know those feelings . I 'd forgotten All about those things . Oh , i 'm sorry , doris . They won 't come back . I 'll be all alone . I won 't be popular anymore . They won 't use me Inthe familyanymore . And you made doris cry ! She cried because It is true . What are you going to do now ? Haven 't you done enough harm ? Leave me alone , linda . I 've got reading to do . Quite a lot . What 's the matter with you ? Aren 't you well ? It 's nothing . I 've got to read . I 've got to catch up with The remembrance of the past ! Right . You four , Over to the house ! Take out the line . This is it . Hurry . Go on ! But what about you , uncle ? Don 't worry . Get going ! All right . Take your time . I 'm coming . Open up ! Come on ! We know There 's someone in there ! Please , wait a minute . I 'm coming . Come on ! Open up ! All right ! I 'm coming ! Come on , come on . Now , watch it . You watch it . What is this ? I 'm moving this chair . I 'm fed up with it In the middle of the room . And this one ... I 'm going to put ... Over here . There . And i 'm going to change Those curtains . I 've never liked them . I 'm gonna get new ones . And i 'm gonna change The laundry basket . I 've decided ... You 're right . The chair 's much better Over there . You know , you 're not well . You were tossing And turning all night . You kept me awake . You ought to stay home today . No , no , i 'm going To the firehouse . I must . Because i don 't know If i 'm going there tomorrow Or any other day . But what about Your promotion ? My promotion ? That was before . Montag . Look , last night ... You were talking in your sleep . I don 't know what . I didn 't understand . And i don 't understand . What 's making you like this ? What 's going on in your head ? I don 't know , And i don 't want to know . But one thing i do want . I want you to get rid Of those books . Take them away , montag . Please . I will . I promise . I 'll do it myself if you like . No , i 'll do it ... After i 've read them . No , now . Do it right now , montag . I 'll leave you . I can 't live With those . You 've got To make a choice . Answer me , montag . How can i answer , linda ? I just don 't know . Excuse me . Do you know The girl who lives here With her uncle ? Clarisse . - they came for them . - who ? - to take them away . - the police ? Not the police ? The firemen ? They came to take them away . They do that now , don 't they ? Only to question them . They let them come back . You can 't tell , can you ? They weren 't like us . They were special . You see over there ? And there . And there too . Do you see ? Now look at their house . There 's nothing . Here , you ! Come here ! What 's the meaning of this ? Sir ... Look ! How often Must i talk to you about this ? I talked to you about it In the office the other day , Didn 't i ? Why can 't you do What you 're told ? Eh ? Why can 't you ? Look ! Look at you ! Look ! Did i tell you to ... Haven 't you got a head ? Is the captain in ? He just stepped out . Didn 't you pass him ? No . Captain . Yeah ? The people Who were arrested Last night , sir . It 's about time . How long have you Been with us ? Three years , sir . Yes , you 're a good man . Remind me to give you one Of my personal medallions . The likeness is remarkable . You 'll see . I , uh ... You , uh ... I already Have one , sir . Oh , so it was you , was it ? How did you get in ? I needed some information About some arrests that Were made last night . I wanted to see Some identifications . Ah ! So montag 's handling The arrests now , is he ? Oh , no , sir , Not at all . Last night , you said . But the identifications Wouldn 't be there . Not yet . In fact , They 've just been handed to me . Let 's see now . Let 's see if they 're Amongst this lot . Oh , they 're the ones ! I see . A little young For him ... I 'd say . He 's her uncle . Friends of yours ? Oh , no , sir . I know them slightly . They live nearby . Ah . And you 'd like their House , is that it ? Yes , sir , that 's it . Well , the house will have To be requisitioned , But you can 't move in Until the niece has been Arrested too . Oh , she ... She 's still at large then ? For the moment , yes . Look at the identification . It hasn 't been stamped yet . It 's just a matter Of a day or two . We 'll get you Your house . Hmm ? How did you get in ? Oh , now , What 's all this about ? Hmm ? Still shaky ? You shouldn 't have come in . Look at you . You look like death . Some fresh air , That 's what you need . A nice bit of fresh air Will put you right again . Incidentally , if you see That niece wandering about This part of the world , You might let us know . It might expedite The matter of the house . Of course , sir . Clarisse , I must talk to you . Not here . What happened ? Uncle was arrested . I got away . But how did it happen ? They came last night . We were all asleep . Come on . Look , i have to get home . It 's terribly important . Uncle woke me up And told me To get away . I escaped Through the skylight Over the roof . This is The last place you Should have come to . I know , but there 's Something i must find . Look , please stay with me . I 'm frightened . All right , I 'll stay with you . It must be here Somewhere . What must be here ? Something . Something i have to find . Find and destroy . Let me look . You wouldn 't know where To start looking . It was my job . How big ? About this big . Papers . Oh . It 's no use . We 'll find it . Don 't you worry . It 's a list of addresses . Friends of my uncle ; Who they are and where They 're hiding . We 'll find it . What are you doing ? We must Destroy these . Uh-huh . I always wanted To tell you ... Our meeting In the monorail Was no accident . I noticed you , And i followed you . I thought You could help us . I knew it when That old woman Killed herself . I realized there Was a connection Between you . Yes . She was afraid she 'd talk And give us away . Yes . And i ... This morning , what do i do ? I get into a little bit Of trouble , And i faint Like a silly , little girl . I can 't be a fireman anymore . What is that over there ? That ? That 's a rocking chair . People used to sit ... Outside their houses On warm evenings and rock Backwards and forwards . Oh , really ? Talking to anyone Passing by . Just talking . We 'll have to go Away from here . I know a place . My uncle told me What to do if ever he was ... If ever he was taken . You follow the river upstream 'Til you come to the old Steam railway line . Then you go on and you go on Until you get to where The book people live . - the good people ? - no , book . The book people . You 've not heard Of them ? No . People who vanished . Some were arrested And managed to escape . Others were released . Some didn 't wait to be arrested . They just hid themselves away . Up in the farm country ; The woods and the hills . They Live there in little groups . The law can 't touch them . They live quite peaceably And do nothing that 's forbidden . Though , if they came Into the city , they Might not last long . But how can you Call them book people ... If they don 't do anything Against the law ? They are books . Each one , men and women , Everyone , commits a book They 've chosen to memory , And they become the books . Of course , every now and then , Someone gets stopped , arrested . Which is why They live so cautiously . Because the secret they carry Is the most precious secret In the world . With them , all human knowledge Would pass away . You must come with me . Oh , no , not yet . Uh , it is too soon for me . I was still burning books . Yes , in time , perhaps . But now everything in my life Has suddenly changed . I must stay in the city . I have a plan . I will hide a book In every fireman 's house And then denounce him . The system will eat itself . We must burn The pyromaniacs out . Now we have to go . Separately . You to your book people And me to strip this off . We shall see Each other again . No , we shan 't . Why pretend we shall ? You are right . We shan 't . Fit and well again ? Good , excellent . Come on , Hurry , no time to lose . I 'm sorry , sir . I was on my way To tell you ... I shan 't be staying With the force , sir . Shan 't be ? But this isn 't How things are done , montag . Not on the eve of promotion . I shan 't be coming In tomorrow . Tomorrow 's another day . Today you 're under my command . Montag , i 'm asking you , As one man to another . Please . Please ! You can 't let me down Like this in front of the men , Not in front of the others . Just this one last call . Then you can do as you like . Montag . This is my house ! Mm-hmm , that 's right . Linda ! I couldn 't bear it . I just couldn 't bear it Anymore . Well , now , montag knows Exactly what we 're looking for . I think we can Leave it to him . To know how to find , One must first know how To hide . Isn 't that so ? I like a man who knows his work . You men , just check the rest Of the house . Everything ready , fabian ? Come on , hurry it up . Come on , Bring us the sparkler . As this is montag 's home , I think , perhaps , he should Do the honors . What are you doing in there ! Have you gone mad ? Come on , get back in there ! Just the books ! The books ! What do you think you 're doing ? There 's no need for that ! I said the books , montag ! That 's good . That 's what i like to see . Sweet reason . Novels aren 't life . What did montag hope To get out of all this print ? Happiness ? What a poor idiot You must have been . This gibberish is enough To drive a man mad . Thought you could learn From these how to walk On the waters , did you ? Montag must learn To think a little . Consider how all these Writings , all these recipes For happiness disagree . Now let this heap Of contradictions Burn itself out . You know it 's we who , At this moment , are working For man 's happiness . Look , isn 't that lovely ? The pages , Like flower petals Or butterflies , Luminous and black . Who can explain The fascination of fire ? What draws us to it ? Whether we 're young or old . Nothing to say ? That 's the spirit . That 's real wisdom . He still has one . What have you got there ? Is this your special book ? It 's got to be burned With the others , and you 're Under arrest . Montag . Get out of there ! Everybody , out of here quick ! He 's gone mad ! Right now ! Go ! Watch for a man running Through the streets . Repeating . Calling all citizens . Montag . Fireman . The criminal is alone And on foot . Let each one stand At his front door . Look and listen . Watch for a man running Through the streets . Repeating . Calling all citizens . Montag . Fireman . The criminal is alone And on foot . Let each one stand At his front door . Look and listen . I am , uh ... Yes , we know Who you are . You 're the man Of the hour . Come . Come and witness Your own capture . My capture ? That 's right . Our beautiful cousin Is being ... Particularly Entertaining today . You 'll see . Oh , i beg your pardon . I amthe journal Of henri brilard By stendhal . Montag is still at large , But time is running out fast . Ah , there it is . The aerial patrol Has sighted the wanted man . They can 't keep the viewers Waiting much longer . The show must go on . They 'll find somebody . Anybody will do to provide them With their climax . There he is . You can see him clearly now . There is montag , Running headlong into the trap , Scurrying about Like a frightened rat . Just look at him , cousins . It 's all over , cousins . Montag is dead . A crime against society Has been avenged . They never showed The man 's face properly . It was too far away , of course . Even your friends are bound To believe you 're dead . Here . You may as well Shed your old skin . " the moon was shining Sulkily ... " because she thought the sun ... " had got no business To be there ... " after the day was done .

Oh , it wasn 't planned . It just so happened that A man here and a man there Loved some book . And rather than lose it , He learned it . And we came together . We 're a minority Of undesirables crying Out in the wilderness . But it won 't Always be so . One day we shall be called On , one by one , to recite What we 've learned .

[ EERIE HUMMING ] CHAINS FOR DEVILS . OH ! WHATEVER IT WAS , SHE ... SHE SEEMED TO BE OVERCOME BY ... BY SOMETHING--WELL ... WELL , IT ALMOST SEEMED LIKE SELF-LOATHING .

HELGA ? WHY ALL THESE QUESTIONS ? YOUR MOTHER 'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HER . SHE 'S DISAPPEARED . SUSAN , WHAT 'S GOING ON HERE ? I DON 'T KNOW , STEVE . WHAT ELSE DID YOU AND MOTHER TALK ABOUT ? COME HERE . YOUR MOTHER DID ASK WHETHER MY INTENTIONS ARE HONORABLE . ARE THEY , STEVE ? WHAT DO YOU THINK ? YOU SHOULDN 'T HAVE INVITED REINHART HERE . YOU 'RE A DIFFICULT WOMAN , LETITIA . NO , NOT DIFFICULT . ONLY AFRAID . OH , SO THAT 'S IT , HUH ? THE SINS OF THE FATHERS , HUH ? WELL , LET ME WARN YOU . NOTHING IS GOING TO DETER ME FROM MY PURPOSE . YES , THAT 'S WHAT CORBIN SAID . BUT HE 'S DEAD , LETITIA . HE 'S BEEN DEAD FOR A LONG TIME . IF THERE WAS EVIL , IT 'S BURIED WITH HIM . ALL THAT REMAINS OF CORBIN IS A FEW HARMLESS OBJECTS IN THE CELLAR . NO , NO ! YOU KNOW HOW LIGHT PAINS ME . WHY DO YOU PERSIST IN THIS DELUSION ? PLEASE , NAHUM , CLOSE THE CURTAINS . PLEASE . I WONDER IF YOU REALIZE HOW LIKE CORBIN YOU 'VE BECOME . THERE 'S NO SIMILARITY WHATSOEVER . I 'VE UTTERED NO INCANTATIONS . NEITHER HAVE I CRIED OUT TO ANY OF THE OTHER SO-CALLED ... CREATURES OF EVIL . IT 'S ONLY YOUR METHODS THAT DIFFER . AND YOU KNOW WHY ? BECAUSE I DON 'T BELIEVE IN IT , ANY OF IT . I NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN IT . IT IS YOU WHO WOULD PERPETUATE THESE BLASPHEMIES ... THESE ABSURDITIES . NAHUM , I SAW YOUR FATHER CHANGE FROM AN UPRIGHT GOD-FEARING MAN INTO AN OLD MAN POSSESSED OF THE DEVIL . WHATEVER HAPPENED TO MY FATHER WILL NOT HAPPEN TO ME . IT 'S ALREADY HAPPENING . I COULD RATHER SEE IT HAPPENING TO YOU , LETITIA , BUT NOT TO ME . IT 'S HAPPENING TO ALL OF US . THERE 'S EVIDENCE OF IT ALL AROUND US . IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CORBIN WITLEY . CORBIN WAS INVOKING THE DARK POWERS WHEN HE DIED . NOW HIS CALL IS BEING ANSWERED . SO THAT IS WHY YOU SENT FOR STEPHEN REINHART . I SENT FOR HIM TO TAKE SUSAN AWAY FROM HERE . WHAT HAVE YOU TOLD HIM ? NOTHING . ARE YOU SURE ? I DON 'T NEED TO TELL HIM ANYTHING . HE CAN SEE FOR HIMSELF . I DON 'T WANT HIM HERE . HE MUST LEAVE . ONE WAY OR ANOTHER , HE MUST LEAVE .

NONE THAT I REMEMBER . WHY NOT ? I DON 'T KNOW . PERHAPS THE NAME OF WITLEY NO LONGER COMMANDS THE AFFECTION AND RESPECT IT ONCE DID . IS , UM ... THAT WHY NO ONE IN THE VILLAGE WOULD DRIVE ME OUT HERE ? YOU MEAN YOU HAD TO WALK ALL THAT WAY ? MM-HMM . THE VILLAGERS HAVE NO USE FOR US , MR. REINHART . I MAY ADD THE FEELING IS MUTUAL . MERWYN . YES , SIR ? HAS MRS. WITLEY HAD HER DINNER ? I PLACED A TRAY BEFORE HER , SIR , BUT SHE DIDN 'T SEEM TO WANT IT . I 'LL TAKE HER UP SOMETHING A LITTLE LATER , FATHER .

MY DAUGHTER HAS ALREADY TOLD YOU , THERE WAS A FIRE . BUT , MR. WITLEY , NO FIRE LEAVES A PLACE LIKE THAT . FATHER 'S NEVER ALLOWED ME TO GO IN THE HEATH . WHY NOT ? I DON 'T KNOW ... BUT AFTER THE FIRE , SOME OF THE VILLAGERS DISAPPEARED THERE . NO ONE 'S EVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED . I THINK , SUSAN , YOU 'RE INCLINED TO EXAGGERATE . I WOULD SUGGEST POSSIBLY THAT YOU BOTH- - MERWYN ! WHAT 'S THE MATTER WITH HIM ? IT 'S ALL RIGHT . THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE . BUT HE 'S UNCONSCIOUS . PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT . I 'LL TAKE CARE OF IT .

WITLEY , BLASPHEMY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT . IN MY HEART , I MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE WAS RIGHT . IT IS AS SHE SAID . A CURSE IS SET UPON THIS HOUSE . HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO BLIND AS NOT TO KNOW THAT ? THAT STONE WAS SENT FROM THE OTHER SIDE BY THE HAND OF CORBIN REACHING OUT TO US FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE . A CURSE ? WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THIS HOUSE OR THE PEOPLE WHO 'VE LIVED IN IT ? I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE STONE WAS NOT SENT BY ANYONE . AH , IT 'S EASY ENOUGH FOR YOU TO SAY THAT , BUT YOU DIDN 'T SEE IT AS I DID THAT SUNDAY MORNING , SCREAMING DOWN OUT OF THE HEAVENS TO CRASH AND BURY ITSELF IN THE HEATH . IT FELL FROM THE SKY . THEN IT WAS A METEORITE . I THOUGHT IT WAS A GIFT FROM HEAVEN . THE PEOPLE FROM THE VILLAGE CAME TO SEE WHAT IT WAS , BUT THEY WOULDN 'T COME NEAR IT . OH , NO , THEY KNEW , BECAUSE THE FEAR OF CORBIN WAS STILL IN THEM . THE NEXT MORNING THE HEATH WAS COVERED WITH A LUSH VEGETATION THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE GROWN THERE . WHY DID YOU BRING IT INTO THE HOUSE ? WHY ? BECAUSE I THOUGHT- - AS CORBIN KNEW I WOULD- - I THOUGHT I 'D FOUND A WAY TO TURN THIS WASTELAND INTO A PLACE OF BEAUTY . GREAT VINEYARDS , GARDENS ... THAT WAS MY DREAM . I THOUGHT THE NAME OF WITLEY WOULD MEAN SOMETHING ONCE AGAIN AND CORBIN 'S INIQUITIES WOULD BE ATONED FOR . EVERYONE HE CAME IN CONTACT WITH WAS TOUCHED BY IT . FATHER , WON 'T YOU PLEASE COME BACK INTO THE HOUSE ? SUSAN ... STEPHEN , WILL YOU TAKE SUSAN AWAY , PLEASE ? WHAT ABOUT YOU ? I WILL STAY HERE TO DESTROY THIS MONSTROUS THING . YOU CAN 'T DESTROY IT . IF YOU GO NEAR IT , THERE IS ONLY ONE RESULT , AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS . YOU SEEM TO FORGET . THIS IS MY HOME . I LIVE HERE ... AND I , LIKE MY FATHER AND HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM , WAS BORN HERE . I 'M AN OLD MAN NOW , AND IF I 'M TO DIE , I WILL DIE HERE . I 'M NOT LEAVING HERE WITHOUT YOU , FATHER .

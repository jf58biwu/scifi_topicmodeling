 Are you able to see anything at all , Burt ? Nothing , captain . Only a surface of clouds . This planet seems to be made of fog . Not even infrared rays get through . Well , keep trying . I 've got the laser on infrared , it may penetrate . There , the strange signals are continuing . Now the localization is sharper . 15 degrees , felcar coaxial alfa vacuum .. Right . This is our sixth orbit around this planet , and that signal always comes from the same point . If a man-made transmitter does exist , that 's the spot , all right . 2 more meteors . Yes , sir . I 'll check on the total . Eldon , Tiona , Kell , we just rejected 2 more meteors . What 's our total now ? 999 , wess . 1 more and I 'll bake you a little birthday cake with 1,000 candles . Without this rejector , we 'd look like a piece of Swiss cheese . Our ship would be down in less than a minute . Let 's prepare for a landing , Brad . Okay . Attention . Attention , all crew members , prepare for landing . In 60 fractions of megon , we 'll start the landing maneuver . The intensity of the gravitational field will be maintained at the wave moment of force g 7 . Synchronize the meteor rejector on the electro-magnetic control device . Apply neuro-vascular tension . Suppress cortical areas x , y , z . Insert the automatic controls . We will keep a distance of 2 parsecs from our sister ship galliot . Respond when command received . Command received . Sanya , get me the captain of the other ship . Spaceship Argos calling spaceship galliot . Spaceship galliot , we 're receiving . Captain Salas is wanted on the ionoscope , please . All right , mark , he 's standing by . You were right , mark . It 's not cosmic radiation . It 's a reality , a reality that we 'll see at first hand . Glad to hear you admit it , Salas . It 's never too late . We were never as crazy as you seemed to think . You certainly had us worried , though . Oh , you 've put a spy on board ? Huh , huh . Anyway , you 'll have to agree it was just luck . You can 't chase after all the sounds in the universe . All right , so it 's not a cosmic cloud . But what about life ? Who can say yet that there 's any life on aura ? Who can assure us that it 's not a natural source of emission ? We 'll find out soon enough . Right now , get ready to land . Synchronize on gravitational wave moment of force g 7 . Shall I put us on the automatic control ? Yes . When you 're 2 parsecs from us . 1 minute . Mark , wait . Your younger brother is here and he has something else to tell you . Mark , I want to warn you . This will be the first and only trip ... We 've lost it . Sanya , the reserve channel . Zinex impulse , quickly . Hello . Hello , galliot . Hello , galliot ? Hello ! Contact 's been broken , mark . The zinex impulse channel , throw it on . The signal 's been interrupted , mark . The planet stopped transmitting . Galliot . Sanya , what about the galliot ? Galliot , hello ! I 'm not getting anything , mark . The zinex impulse channel , try it again . Hello , hello . Hello ! There 's nothing , mark . The radio communications are blocked . Try it again , Sanya . Hello . Hello , galliot ! The automatic alarm . Emergency ! Emergency ! The gravitational force is increasing rapidly . Wess , where are we at ? Give me a reading . 20 , mark . 20 g . Seal bulkheads . Got to activate them now . Brad , the automatic control , disengage it . I 'm switching to manual . What happened ? Why did she attack you ? Is she crazy ? What happened ? don 't you remember ? Wess ! Mark . Try to get hold of him . Mark ! Are you out of your minds ? What 's wrong with everyone ? Where are you going ? Mark ! Tiona . Tiona ! Stop ! Dr. karan ! Stop ! Carter . Carter ! Mark , what was I trying to do ? Mark- - in here , mark ! Mark , now karan 's gone crazy . I was just coming to when he attacked Brad . I rushed him , but he escaped through there . Burt , you stay here . Wess , come with me . He 's activated the security lock . There 's nothing we can do . They open only when the sensors touch the ground . The helmets ! We 'd better get the helmets . What happened ? How did I get out of the ship ? What are you looking at me like that for ? We don 't know what happened , Karan . Only some of us have been behaving strangely with no memory of it afterward . Do you feel all right now ? I guess so . You 're sure ? Yes , yes , I 'm sure . All right , go inside . Some of the men seem to be hurt , doctor . I want you to take a look at them . He doesn 't remember anything either . What 's happened ? What 's going on ? I wish I knew . I can 't see anything . Not a sign of the galliot . Yet we don 't seem to be damaged at all . Come on , let 's get in the ship . I can 't see a scratch on the radar guidance arms . Let 's check the underside . There 's no damage . It 's as if we made a practice landing at the space academy . Come on let 's get in . All right , all right . Quiet down . Quiet down . Stay calm . Let 's all try to stay calm and figure out what happened . Now , the automatic controls went completely haywire . Maybe we can find out why after wess has had a chance to check over his recordings . Without warning , the force of gravity increased like mad . And it went up to 40 g . A force which only a planet with a mass 1,000 times superior to ours could 've put out . That 's not all . While you were all unconscious and I was expecting the ship to crash head-on , the force suddenly stopped and we set down gently . And then ... You all went crazy . And if you hadn 't held out , I hate to think of what would 've happened . Yes , it is pretty puzzling . What do you think , professor Karan ? I don 't know . I don 't know what to think . I 've always known that any force greater than 25 g 's kills every living thing in a few seconds . Urgent . Urgent . Emergency ! Be quiet . Emergency ! Conditions desperate . Little chance of survival . Help us . We can 't hold out much longer . Repeat . Conditions desperate . Sounds like capt . Salas . They must be in trouble . Sanya , keep trying . Burt , take a look on the infra-ray , see if you can spot anything . They must be fairly close . Urgent . Urgent . Help us . Hello . Hello . Argos calling galliot . Argos calling galliot . We 're receiving you . Continue on this frequency . We 'll try to get a fix on you . What is your position ? Argos calling galliot . Argos calling galliot ! Mark , look ! What have you got ? The galliot . The red 's cut through . Can 't tell how far it is . Get me a fix on this right now . We 'll do a low-altitude takeoff and search . They can 't be too far away . Wess , Brad , control . All our solar batteries have been short-circuited . Any visible reason ? Another mystery ? Wess , what can we do about it ? I checked the temperature . Second lavic stage . I 'm not interested in the temperature . Can we get across it or not ? Well , it 's pretty dangerous down there . The rocks appear to be fused and they 're solid enough . If they continue across the marsh , and if we 're lucky ... Let 's try it . Clear . It 's obvious . They fought . They fought and killed each other off . Just as we were about to do . None of this--this madness that has touched some of us , none of this is coincidence . This was planned . By whom ? By what ? And what about the others ? We can look for them . Poor Toby , on his first trip ... The chamber 's locked from the inside . We 'll need a torch to break through . I counted 4 , what about the others ? They don 't seem to be inside . Let 's take a look around . There isn 't anybody in the upper chambers . And what about the control room ? It 's empty . Look in the dome 's secondary corridors . All right . In the meantime , we 'll look in the sections of the automatic circuits . Now , in case of any emergency , we meet in the atomic generator room . Find anything ? No . The energy section is deserted . Let 's continue . The 3 that are missing can 't disappear into thin air . Shh . Listen . It 's coming from the generator room . Turrell . And Salas , mark ? The meteor rejector is out of commission . It can 't be repaired , either . The galliot won 't fly again . Neither will her crew . What about this bulkhead ? We 've got to get through . I 'll take care of it , mark . I 'll get the cutting torch from the Argos . No , you 'd never make it alone . No . We 'll bury Derek and the others and then we 'll leave you on guard , Eldon . We 'll go for the cutting torch and I promise you , we 'll get back just as fast as we can . Sanya , I know how you feel , but don 't go to pieces now . Just be thankful we were spared . Come on . We 've got to keep moving . We 'll get back as fast as we can , Eldon . Keep a sharp watch . Eldon ... Eldon ... Eldon ... Eldon ... Eldon ? Eldon , where are you ? Eldon , where are you ? Eldon ? Eldon ! Maybe he 's inside the ship . Tiona , you stay here . If anything moves , shoot first , ask questions later . It 's weird . There 's no one here . But we left 4 bodies here . How could they have disappeared ? Eldon ? Eldon ! Kir ! Salas ! Where are they ? They 're gone . All of them . Eldon , too . I left him on guard . Listen , mark , maybe you imagined it . Maybe the bodies really weren 't in here , you just thought you saw them . Hallucination . I don 't suffer from hallucinations , Karan . I saw the bodies . Maybe our senses react in a strange way on this planet . I saw the bodies . I saw my brother , dead . What happened to Eldon , then ? He wasn 't a ghost , a hallucination . Let 's take it easy . There must be some logical explanation . That 's right , mark . Mark . What is it , wess ? We weren 't dreaming . Those bodies really existed . Look , blood ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! What happened ? Tiona , what did you see ? Tell us . Come on , let 's get out of here . Hurry ! There seems to be several things completely unexplainable . For 2 years , we heard the electronic signals coming from this planet . Now that we 're here , nothing . Yes , but we did hear voices . A strange tongue , but voices . There were intelligent beings here . You could 've fooled me . I never felt so all alone . Maybe we 're not alone . Somebody or something could be watching us here , right now . If there are any intelligent creatures on this planet , they 're our enemies . Wess , you 've been taking sightings and adding figures , what does it come out to ? How long can we stay here ? 3 days , mark . Another 3 days before this planet 's orbit will have swept us so far away , we may not get back home at all . What do you think ? Can you boost the solar batteries by then ? I 'm trying to hook up some other way of starting us . What are our chances ? We have 3 chances in 10 to make it , or be blown to smithereens . All right , wess , tomorrow morning , you get to work . Take whoever you need to help you . Right now , I think we should all get some sleep . I think we need it . A captain should not be afraid . And I confess now , to whoever may hear this , that today , now , I am experiencing fear . I must not let my crew know this , I must keep them busy . I must not let them know that the situation appears more hopeless with each passing day . Dictated by capt . Mark Markary , of the spaceship Argos on the planet aura- - wess ! Wess ! More trouble ? He was trying to disconnect the meteor rejector . Disconnect the meteor rejector ? I don 't understand . I assure you , I don 't understand it either . Wess , you knew what you were doing . Yes , I knew . I was fully aware , all the time . What ? I couldn 't help myself . I fought it with all my power . But , it was no use . I had to disconnect the meteor rejector . But why , wess , why ? I don 't know ! It was like ... Like another will fighting my own , in my mind . Trying to take over control . Dr. Karan , have you got any thoughts on this ? The only conclusion I can make is that each one of us is his own worst enemy . But how ? Why ? I 'm afraid I know . Whatever unseen beings are out there , they apparently have the power to influence our minds when we 're unconscious . They tried it during the landing and just now when we were sleeping . If what you say is true , Karan , we mustn 't give them any more chances . From now on , we 'll put a guard on anyone who 's sleeping . Who 's there ? Burt ! Burt ! What 's up ? I ... I don 't know . I thought I heard something . Did you see anything ? I don 't know what I saw . I don 't even know if I saw anything at all . Mark said to sing out if we saw anything not in the book . If we saw any thing at all . I 'm going to report . Emergency . Guard post 3 . Emergency . Wess , you come with me . The rest of you , be careful . What is it ? I thought I saw something . What ? Out there . Well , like luminous globes . I saw them out of the corner of my eye . But when I looked , they were gone . Where 's Burt ? He 's gone back to post number 2 . Keep your eyes open , but don 't get carried away . Who 's out there ? Hold it ! Burt , what happened ? Tell me , who did it ? It was ... Captain , captain Salas . What 's out there , mark ? What 's happening ? That 's what we have to find out before they kill us all . Come on , let 's get him into the ship . Give me a hand . 1 entire crew lost and 2 of our own crewmen gone . Burt dead , Eldon disappeared . And this unknown enemy keeps getting closer . The enemy is also becoming visible . What do you mean by that ? Well , you saw something . Something not quite identifiable , out of the corner of your eye . As if it were composed of little globes of light , something fleeting , nothing definite . The minute I looked at the things directly , they were gone . How can you explain it ? I don 't know . It 's possible they 're an alien form of life . That 's true . Their form here could be based on a different plane of vibrations . Flesh-and-blood men can 't see them , except obliquely , as you did , mark . Those strange walls we heard could be their voices . That 's right . Well , we 'll bury Burt tomorrow . Another tomb we have to leave on this dangerous planet . Sanya ? I 'll be right with you , mark . First , I want to remove Burt 's nameplate . Sanya . Sanya , come on . They need you . Oh , I still have Burt 's nameplate . Give it to me . I 'll finish the records . You 've done enough today . Thank you . Aah ! Rest well , Burt . I 'm sorry we weren 't around to help you . I promise we 'll try to see that you didn 't die in vain . All right , let 's not stand around , we 've got work to do . Feeling better , tiona ? Better , mark . I swear it , mark . I didn 't imagine it . Wess ? I think we 'll make it , mark . I 'm beginning to get energy traces across the inductors . How much longer ? We might be ready by tonight . Good . We 're making a little tour of inspection . Carter says he saw something in the valley , something shining . Let 's go take a look . Mark ! Come here . Look down there . That 's what I saw shining . Finally , something tangible . That doesn 't disappear when I look straight at it . Looks like it 's been here for a long time . Look how pitted and scarred the hull is . Doesn 't look like any ship I 've ever seen . Do you think it belongs to the aureans ? I doubt they ever built any spaceships . If they had , we would 've ... Look , mark . It 's 3 times the size of us , and judging by the deterioration of the calcium , it must 've been here a long time . Probably belonged to an ancient civilization . Carter , you stay here . Keep your eyes and ears open . Right . Sanya and I will take a look around inside this thing . Oh , uh , if he moves , just call out . Right . Sanya , what is it ? Oh , I ... I got a shock . How ? Touching that . Ouch ! That must be over 200 volts . I wonder what they used it for . Possibly it 's an electric torch . They ... Held it in their hands and it became luminous . Beings as big as they seem to have been could have held it without feeling any kind of shock . Carter . Carter ! Carter ! Carter ! Car ... Ter ! Mark , look what I found . What is it ? Looks like a tuning fork . Why didn 't we think of that before ? Of what ? The locking device could be a Sonic one , a lock designed to open only to a certain sound , to a certain frequency only . Mark , it 's strange in here . I can 't breathe . Something 's drawing the air out through this vent . We 've got to find a way to get out of here . If only we could find the secret of that lock . Ooh ! Quick , get out ! Carter ! Carter , where are you ? Maybe he 's gone back to the Argos for help . Yes , you could be right . Come on . Let 's go . Let 's get back . Carter ? Yes . No , mark . He 's not with us . He was with you , wasn 't he ? Has he disappeared as well ? I 'll tell you what happened later . Mark ? Tiona , she 's in shock . What happened ? She was standing guard and all of a sudden I heard her scream . When I reached her , she could only point and whisper , " Danny , Toby . " There was nothing , mark . Absolutely nothing . She simply broke down . We 'd better talk to her . I saw them , aah . I saw them , aah ... I saw them . I looked right at them . Who did you see , tiona ? Who ? They were there , in the fog . All mutilated and bloody . Who , tiona , who ? Tell me . I looked right at them . They didn 't go away . They were humans , not ghosts . Who , tiona , who ? Tell me , who did you see , tiona ? Empty faces . Dead faces . Post number 1 . Post number 1 . Reply to call . Post number 2 , post number 2 . Post number 2 . Call received . All ok . Here 's post number 3 . Post number 3 . Post number 3 . Everything fine here too . I 'm passing back to number 1 . Machinery room . Machinery room . This is post number 1 . Wess ? I 'm anxious to know how you 're doing . Standing guard here makes one even more impatient for the blast-off . Is there much more to do before the batteries will be ready ? Well ? I understand . You 're worried . But I don 't think it 'll be too much longer . We 're practically there , mark . Another 8 circuits to go and then ... And then we either take off or we ... Or we blow up . Right now , I 'd welcome either one . Post number 3 alarm ! Who 's there ? Who 's out there ? No ! don 't fire . Salas . Kir . Yes , mark . It 's us . It 's us . We 're so exhausted it 's hard to concentrate . We remember descending for a landing with all conditions perfect . Then nothing . Until we found ourselves fighting our way out of unconsciousness somewhere out there . Well ? That 's about it , mark . Go on . We walked around some , looking for the galliot . But we didn 't find her . It was a miracle that you found us . All right . I 'm glad you made it . I sure can use you . Now , go and get some sleep . Thanks , mark . I forgot . If one of you sleeps , the other must stand guard . That 's an order . I 'll explain it later . Very well , mark . What do you make of it ? I don 't know what to think , mark . Shock ? Temporary or partial amnesia ? By now , nothing should surprise us . Anyway , you can 't argue with the fact that they 're here . And very much alive . Or so it seems . Mark . You said " seems " , mark . How many strange things seem and then are ever since we got on this planet ? I really saw them , the 3 we buried yesterday . I know they 're dead . And I saw another one , mark . Who , tiona ? Burt . Burt ? Even though we buried him yesterday . I saw him , mark . I saw him . I saw him , mark ! If only I could be certain of what you 're saying . There 's a way to be certain . You see ? It 's intact . Open it , mark . Ah ! Wess ! Dr. Karan ! Salas and Kir are not in their bunks . Have you seen them ? No . Have you ? Salas ! Salas ! Salas ! No , it 's not Salas . Just his body . I inhabit the body of your late captain . And I 'm just one of many beings on this planet . Many beings who are desperate . We 've been in trouble many years now , and we 're fighting to survive . We arranged for several of you to kill each other so that we could take over your bodies . You are our last chance . It 's imperative that our race continue to exist . At our expense ? If you were in our place , you would understand . On your planet , I know you humans have fought and killed for centuries . Do you really expect us to be any different ? We cannot be wiped out . We 'll stop at nothing . We must fight , no matter how . We are a race that exists on a vibratory plane different from yours . Our limitations are entirely different . Our technology , we cannot build anything , spaceships like this . We need ships to get away . Perhaps our survival is possible somewhere else . Our sun 's been dying , as you can see . And that means the end of our species as well . We have been attempting to summon you here for centuries . Just as our sun had no more energy , you heard our message . We never expected you to actually respond . You mean , it was nothing but a lure . You wanted us here . That 's why you sent that message . Have you tried this trick before ? Yes . The strange ship from another system . And I suppose you need our dead bodies ? No . They must be willing only to submit . Lose their bodies as well as lose their will . We 'll never submit to a breed of parasites . Our relationship would be symbiotic . In effect , we would be 1 body . It would in no sense be parasitical . You 've got no choice . Either all of us go back together or none of you , nobody will go back . You will never get there . You 'll see . We will get there , mark . A certain rejector , vital to you , has been taken away . You can 't leave without it . We 'll return it to you , only if you agree to take us back with you . All right , you 've heard all of the facts . And you 'll cooperate . No , never . We 'll give up our lives to save our own race . Quick , the generator room ! Wess , you have the red key to the atomic detonators . Here 's the green one . I want 3 pounds of plutonium . What are you going to do , mark ? The galliot 's going to be blown up with its entire cargo of living dead . But first , I 've got to get back the meteor rejector . Wess , how long will it take you to get ready ? I have to finish the photonic ignition . The rest is all set . Good . I want you to stay here . You 2 come with me . Wess , as soon as we 're out , close the doors and the bulkheads , but keep the screens turned on . As soon as you see us coming back , turn on the ignition . We 'll worry about replacing the rejector after we 're out in space . That 's taking a terrible risk . Yes . I wish it were the only risk we 'd have to run before taking off . But there 's no other solution . Go on , get the detonators . Tiona , you stay here . Cover our retreat . don 't move for any reason . And remember , the danger is not only in front of you . 15 seconds after the galliot explodes , if we haven 't come back , you run to the Argos and take off , understand ? Mark , I can 't let- - that 's an order , Karan . Let 's go . There 's nobody here . Now , I want you 2 to stay right here . No , mark . You won 't go alone . Listen , Brad , I 'm not trying to be a hero . We each have 1 charge . If I don 't make it , it 'll be your turn . If he fails , you try it next . You stay here , Brad . Cover us . My brother . He 's turned into 1 of them . Take the count . Ready ? Now . Go ahead . 1 ... 2 ... 3 . Quick , in the generator room . Sanya , give me the countdown . 29 ... 28 ... 27 ... 26 ... 25 ... All right , you can stop now . 20- - throw away your gun . Leave the meteor rejector . You 'd better get used to the idea , mark . You 've reached the end . You have lost . Toby , if you have anything left in you of what you were , let me go on . Fortunately , there 's nothing of what I was left . Only the body 's the same and now ... No use , mark . You can 't harm me with violence . Sorry , Toby , but this is the only way I can prevent you from stopping me . Ah ! Time 's running out . Hurry . Ah ! Ah ! There they are . They 're being followed . We 'd better help them . Dead . Dead ? I 'd better replace the meteor rejector right away . Sanya , you take the controls until we come back . It 's sad , mark . Out of 18 people , there are only 3 of us left . I 'm ashamed to be alive . They died to save our planet . Can you imagine ? Our world invaded by those horrible creatures ? Just thinking about it , seems a nightmare . Mark . Yes , it is sad , wess . But it was only luck that brought us here . Wess , you need some sleep . You haven 't slept for 2 nights . Yes . Sanya and I will keep watch . I need some sleep . Who 's there ? Mark , is it you ? Sanya ? If I wasn 't so wide awake , I 'd swear I was dreaming . What happened , wess ? I was about to fall asleep , when I heard footsteps out in the passageway . They approached my cabin . Then what happened ? Then , the door opened , slowly . As if someone were debating whether or not to come in . And did they ? No , Sanya . Then you didn 't see anything . Yes , I did . He was holding his field ray gun . He was mirrored on the metal wall . Are you sure you saw him ? I know you won 't believe me , Sanya . I certainly wish I was wrong , myself . But it was really him . Mark ! It was mark , Sanya . Why did he come to me so ... Furtively ? Maybe he wanted to kill me . Well , then what are your conclusions , wess ? Unfortunately , there 's only 1 conclusion . Even mark is controlled by one of them . Oh , it 's impossible . Let 's go see . Wess ? Wait a minute . Mark . Wess has found out about us . don 't be afraid , wess . Nobody wants to harm you . Nobody wants to kill you . You ... You 're one of them . And you too , Sanya . It 's horrible . You . Both of you . You must become one of us . All you have to do is want it . Just let one of us join you . It 'll give you this wonderful new complexity . No . No ! Our world will never fall into your hands ! Maybe not , but you won 't be the one to stop us . Yes , I will ! Ah ! Sanya , without the meteor rejector , we 'll never be able to reach home . What do we do ? We 'll have to land now , on that planet . I 've done an analysis with a special probe . We can exist in the atmosphere . It 's the third planet of the star we call sol . It 's so small , it 's not even marked on the astronavigation charts . But will it be possible to live there , for us and those who follow us ? It 's most likely a young , primitive world . But I think it 'll be all right for us . I 'll activate the long-range telescopic lens . Yes , I was right . It is a puny civilization . Their buildings are still made of stone and iron . How will they accept us ? I hope , well . For them .

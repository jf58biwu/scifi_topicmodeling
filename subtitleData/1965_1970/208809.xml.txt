 These objects . Any idea what they are ? No , you wouldn 't . You 've probably no idea . It 's artificial , you see . It 's not only a finger . It 's inferiority complex in the shape of a finger . It 's not the finger I treated . I 'm a psychiatrist . I 've just filled the gap in mind . I was checking our new plant . You don 't mind my talking , I hope . No , please keep talking . Perhaps I shouldn 't have been so careless . We should have used liquid air . But we ran out ... we used liquid oxygen instead . I thought it was liquid air . You were unlucky . Yes , it was bad luck , but my own fault . If I could have called it destiny or even a war wound ... I think I might have been saved . Now , it 's like being exiled . No one even remembers it happened . Stop it , please . I 've become very sensitive to noise . I 'm sorry . I was almost through anyway . Does losing your face affect your senses , too ? You 're tired . Everyone says the same thing . Let 's take off the bandages . Certainly not . Some tea ? No . Sit down . You 're always moving around when you 're not working . Sit down . You sat there not to look at me . It 's your imagination . Will you help me in a little experiment ? Aren 't you cold ? Are you ? No , not very . I 'm hot . The bandages , probably . Why don 't you take them off ? Not good for the skin . You can 't save something that 's already dead . Your face ... You 're old enough not to mind . I 'll make some tea . Don 't run away . Why should I ? Why do people feel the way they do about faces ? Something like hives ? Quite right . But I know something else . You don 't really need bandages . But in your case ? Perhaps , if I were writing or calling someone . Beginning some experiment ? I 'll help you . All right . Turn out the light first . Turn out ? Having lights at night means being civilized ? Maybe ... But a faceless man feels free only when it 's dark . That 's why deep-sea fish are so hideous . Isn 't it a parable ? It 's not a parable ! I live in a much greater darkness . What 's that noise ? What noise ? I want to put out all the lights in the world . Or gouge everyone 's eyes out . If I had the right to do it . Eyes aren 't just to look at faces . The face is only a space above the neck covered with a sheet of rice paper . Do you agree ? I wanted to think so . Only a layer of skin . I tried to convince myself so . But I 'm not so sure now . The face is the door to the mind . Without it , the mind is shut off . There 's no communication . The mind 's left to corrode , to disintegrate . The mind of a rotten monster . I 'm buried alive . You yourself shut the door . No one stops you from getting out . I 'm just like others ? ... so long as it 's dark . It doesn 't work after all . It was too sudden . You wouldn 't let me . Why didn 't you stop me ? But I know who you are . How do you know ? How do you know I 'm not someone else ? Tell me . But your voice ... Voice ? Nonsense . We 'd all sound alike in bandages like these . I 'm sorry , sir . Why ? Never mind . Hello . Mind if I smoke ? Of course not . Why ? I look funny with a cigarette sticking out of my bandages . That 's foolish . Your secretary couldn 't prove who I was . What ? I 'd like to take a vacation . Of course . That 's what I 've been suggesting . I want time to see whether I 've the right to stay on here . You 're you . No need to think about it . I don 't want to take advantage of you . Forget it ! It was in line of duty . That 's not the problem . I 've no face , yet I 'm ... You 're tired . I wish I were . I seem like a monster sometimes even to myself . Take it easy . You think too much . You 're wrong . You 're asking me to cut off your wrist instead of putting on a new finger . It 's your duty to save patients . But to help mercy killings isn 't . Mercy killings ? You 're exaggerating . I can replace any part of your body . That 's no better than bandages . It would be even more hideous . Do you prefer bad teeth to false ones ? That 's different . How ? How is it different ? Go ahead , if you insist ... May I call the nurse ? Remember , I hold you responsible . I 'm gonna burn my wife 's face like mine . You agree , right ? You can give her false teeth then . For a man in your position , you 're talking like a child . My wife refused me . What good is revenge ? Revenge ? It 's not that . I 'd just be freeing her from her prejudice about faces . Doing that would help me a lot . Nothing encourages a patient more than trust in his doctor . Are you serious ? Of course . At least , it makes an excuse . I 'm such a coward , I can 't resist good excuses . Still I 'd rather keep distance from criminal cases . I don 't follow you . I doubt whether I 'll succeed . But it 's an interesting experiment . It 's against medical ethics , but you 've talked me into it . I 've one condition . Report everything you do . The mask is for temporary use . Not yours to keep . Thank you . It came out very well . Plaster ? Sodium alginate . We 'll use a paraffin mold next . Can you come tomorrow ? Any time . This is my only work now . Do you live here ? I 'm the super . I saw the ad . I 'd like a room . He has a visitor now ... a lady . But I 've come for a room . Please don 't tell him . I 'll give it back . Yes ? Who is it ? I saw your ad . Any vacant rooms ? I 'll be right with you . Sorry I ... Yoko ! Stealing it again ! Your daughter ? Well , yes . Excuse my appearance . I was taking a bath . Well , the room ? One moment . I 'll get the price list . All automatic locks . A chain , too , for safety . Please . The bathroom . Another automatic lock here . The washroom . The bedroom . A nice view . Wardrobe ... I haven 't changed my mind . I 've found a hideout for the mask . That 's not what I asked you . You mean my plans ? About your double life with your mask . We 'll make up for each other . Will it succeed ? Do you know what I thought of in the apartment ? Let me see ... What to do with all your freedom ? No , I thought about jealousy . Yes . But that 's only natural . It 's impossible for me to make my wife jealous . You mean using your mask to make her jealous ? Using it for all human relations , including jealousy . I 'll ask you again . Are you more interested in going back than leaving ? Does it bother you ? No , it 's healthy enough psychiatrically . I was afraid you might try to use it to escape from yourself . A difference in viewpoint . This plastic 's quite interesting . Now , it 's like clay . But when handled , it becomes elastic like rubber . It 's almost like the cellular tissues of the skin . Seems quite real when you put it on the Langer lines . Langer lines ? The arrangement of the skin 's cellular tissues . I see . How will my face look ? I wonder , though I trust you . Yes , trust me . It 's tough to do without changing your original structure . You 'll look differently , but that 's about all . Where does the mask join skin ? That 's the difficult part . It 'd be most obvious around the eyes . You 'll need sunglasses . I won 't complain . Oh , it 's chilly . What 're you doing ? I thought I 'd make some tea . We just had some . No use trying to find something to do . It makes me nervous . Shall I turn out the lights ? No , no , I 'm quite comfortable . I got used to it , or maybe I just gave up . Where 'd you go today ? No place . Worried ? No , you couldn 't be . Not much a man with a bandaged face can do . Still angry with me ? Don 't talk as if you are the victim ! I didn 't mean it that way . You may be a victim , too , after all . Until a few days ago , I really meant to hurt you to make your face worse than mine . It 's your fault . You lied when you said you didn 't mind my face . You had to say it . I know that . Easy to say the monster is the one to blame . Everything 's the monster 's fault . You 've harped on it so often , I 'm beginning to believe it . Because I imagine you think that way . I get awkward even more . Why ? Why imagine so ? Never mind . I 'm above such things now . Actually , I saw a movie today . It was cold . Theaters are dark , aren 't they ? No one minds how you look . What were they showing ? A young girl was sitting in front of me . She was alone at first , but later a man came and sat beside her . There were other seats , but he sat right next to her . I 'll leave the rest to your imagination . Such a bold fellow he was . Paid no attention to anybody . She let him ? I think so . I mean , I don 't really know what went on between them . Something may or may not have happened . But I was shocked to realize he 's just like a masked man ! Long ago , hangmen used to wear masks . I wonder if they felt the same . I 'm watching you closely . You feel you 're looking at holes in a wall , don 't you ? What do you mean ? Nothing in particular . Some monsters want to look like people , and vice versa . Even monsters have their pleasures . So spare me your sympathy ! Hey , beauty ! Don 't be stuck up . Say something . Open it , please . PSYCHIATRIC SECTION NO.2 Attention ! Air raid ! Let 's play baseball ! The air raid 's over . A nice breeze . A bad wind ... I 'd like to see the sea . Stupid . I meant to show something nice . Do as you please . Get my ball . Monster . You 're enjoying it more ? Yes , I am . It 's such a romantic experiment . You can 't have it on other patients . You 'd make a mask for yourself ? Hardly . Having to watch something like this is quite enough . Something like this ? It 's like making an invisible man . I can hardly see what you imagine . What would my wife do if I made her a mask ? Don 't . I 'd like some coffee . Sugar ? Plenty . I 've been smoking too much . My tongue 's rough . Your wife 's listening again . This may be a terrible thing . Yes , we 're interfering with natural laws . Perhaps that man ... He might use that mask to seduce his wife . Really ? You agree ? You couldn 't do much . Men don 't have wings . No matter how high up they go , they 've got to come down . I 've become a monster . Brother ... There won 't be a war for awhile , will there ? Probably not . But who knows ? We can 't even be sure about tomorrow 's weather . That 's so . It 's true of war , too . Most likely , we only know after it 's begun . That 's true . Good morning . Don 't worry . I 'm in a good mood today . Will you have lunch with me ? I was joking . Mask makes men bold . Think nothing of it . Just think I 'm drunk . I 've been thinking . I 've got hold of myself . I 'd like to talk about my future in a rational way . Come off it . Stay with us ! There 's no need for talk . No , I can 't handle people anymore . I know . You needn 't tell me . I can handle the technical end , though . I 'm stuck with the bandages . Can I return to the factory at my present pay ? I don 't feel any need to change . But if you insist ... It 's a load off my shoulders . I 'll do it by the time your leave 's up . Is your wife well ? Why ? Why ? Why you ask ? From now on , I 'll depend on telephones and letters . The only me you 'll see will be my signature . I 'll try not to be conspicuous . You 'll get used to it in time . You 're looking tired now . A few minutes with me exhausts you . No wonder my wife 's not looking too well . I 'll leave now . How would he be ? That face ? No . The size and texture of his skin . Isn 't he too young ? He 'd be easy to talk to . Shall we go ? Hungry ? It 's too early for lunch ... Yes . All right . Two cokes . The same for me . We 'd like to ask a favor of you . What ? What 's this ? It 's a 10,000 yen favor . How about it ? You haven 't told me what I have to do yet . Sell us your face . My face ? Only the mold of your face . We wouldn 't skin you for only 10,000 yen . Only the mold ? We won 't use it against you . But isn 't it like fingerprints ? The shape of the glove changes with the wearer . We want the pores , sweat glands . Just surface details . He 's no good . There 's nothing to lose . Let 's go . I still don 't get it . What 're you buying it for ? Please take it . I 'm going away for a week . Business ? Any objections ? No . I 'll have to pack your things . When do you leave ? I 'm surprised . I thought you 'd be impressed . My agreeing to go on a business trip . I am . I 'm sorry . Don 't be offended . I didn 't mean to be nasty . Let 's talk . You go to your class on Friday , don 't you ? Did you finish that one ? Not yet . Almost . A polished or a natural stone ... which is the most real ? I 'd rather not talk about it . Why ? It 's ambiguous . I see . Changing the subject 's your prerogative . What shall we talk about ? Have you ever wondered why women use make-up ? Well ... It 's not to catch men , is it ? You 're way off . In the Tale of Genji era it was considered virtuous to conceal one 's face . Women showed only their long hair . It 's the same even now in Arab countries . The make-up 's a sort of mask too . To be humble . Humble ? No woman ought show face without make-up . Sounds like very involved sarcasm . Sarcasm ? Isn 't it ? Is that better than pride ? Sensible type , practical type , adventurous type , idealist type ... I had a hard time with so many types . I talked it over with the nurse . Should have asked your wife , too ? No , not that . Eyes . Well ? You left the mole , too ? Yes , more life-like with some faults . Shall we try it on ? Can 't get the feel of it unless it 's in place . Let me take off your bandages . Don 't move . It fits . Beautifully done . It 'll be hot , but you 'll have to stand it . The chemicals will set gradually . Move your lips a little . Now back . Moving your face under this heat creates the right wrinkles . It 's too smooth and unnatural as it is . Move your mouth once more . That 's fine . Now , you 're free to talk or do anything you want . Won 't perspiration make it come loose ? A special chemical contracts the sweat glands . It may be hard to breathe at first . Skin respiration 's impossible . It 's hard to talk . A different voice might be better . Certain things you must strictly observe ! Don 't wear the mask more than 12 hours at a time . The skin gets clogged . The change is incredible . Wonderful . Politician ... It seems unnatural without a beard . Which one would be good ? Isn 't that one all right ? Not that one . The other . This one ? It 's a strange feeling . Like someone 's taken me over . I think it 's a nice face . Don 't you ? It 's only about four millimeters even where I added most . Only ? Yes , a very delicate operation . It still seems strange to me . Pleasant , with individuality . Even changing clothes affects people . But I 'm myself . Nothing can change that . I hope . What 's that ? A drink , please . I said at first I was reluctant to do this work . As an experiment , I was curious , but I felt it was dangerous . But I gave in and agreed . Please drink this . Practice using your lips . And this medicine . What is it ? Is it difficult to drink ? Not exactly . Fine , if you don 't spill it . Can I drink hot things ? Of course , anything . Injection , Doctor ? Yes , give him one now . I feel I 'm smothering . Bear with it a bit more . What were we talking about ? Why a shot ? Yes ... about my fear . The effect the mask might cause you internally . Please don 't exaggerate . Do you feel a prickling sensation ? No , but I don 't feel it 's a part of me yet . No feeling of fresh air coming in ? I feel like I 'm in an oven . It 'll be better soon . When the mask fits better , you 'll be a new man . You 'll be an unregistered man . Psychologically invisible . I 'm me . What was that medicine you gave me ? Are they taking effect ? I feel numb . A narcotic and a sedative . I worried your nervousness would wrinkle it unevenly . Relax . Laugh , whistle ... don 't resist the mask ... accept it . Three minutes more . Please smile . Any face laughs once in a while . You still look like a sick man . Now , please smile . No , no , a real smile . I don 't feel the wind on my face . They say a blind man can tell where he is by sensing the air . The world outside seems so terribly far away . I feel as if I might fall down . Wait a while . You were born only an hour ago . To your maiden voyage . To your creation would be more appropriate , wouldn 't it ? No need to talk like that ! Wait . It 's a trick of yours . Trick ? Yes . Fascinated by the challenge of the mask , but resisting it . Nonsense . You 're the one who is challenging me . No , you 're not afraid of the light any more . You 're different from when you were bandaged . The medicine did it . No . When the waitress came by , your eyes were fixed on her legs . The mask has started showing itself . It 's just this dizziness . Everything seems so disconnected . Is that because of the mask ? Be quiet ! A guilty conscience ? What do you want ? Your frank appraisal of yourself . You promised you 'd tell me everything . I 'm not hiding anything . Don 't push me so . All right . I may be a little too insistent . But don 't go too far . Too far ? In what way ? If you can 't stand it ... Still saying that ? You always do . No , I 'm half in doubt myself . Try to understand . Perhaps , I 'm unduly worried . Frankly , I hope so . Masks could utterly destroy all human morality . Right ? Name , position , occupation all such labels wouldn 't matter any more . Everyone would be strangers to each other . It 'd be natural to be alone . There 'd be no need to feel guilty about it . Doctor ... Do I have to be with you as long as I wear the mask ? Hardly . Only just at first ... I 'll go if I bother you . I 'll tell you ... Everything . Will you tell me frankly how you feel now ? I 've begun to get in your way . Because I know who you are ? I want to test myself alone . The mask 's taking you over . I want to be on my own . It 's been so long . Very well . I look forward to seeing you again tomorrow . Remember to wash off the adhesive before you go to bed . Yes ? Who is it ? I saw your ad . Any rooms still vacant ? Yes , yes . I 'm coming . Sorry I kept you waiting . Yoko ! Stealing it again ! Your daughter ? Well , yes . Excuse my appearance . I was taking a bath . Five floors ? Yes . One moment . I 'll get the price list . Did you see me ? I 'm trying to help the super 's girl . Poor thing , she 's mentally retarded . He does nothing for her . I don 't want her to lose everything . Even a dog can be trained to do things . I don 't want her ... Excuse me . I 'm in a hurry . Don 't ... I 'll buy you one . Really ? Don 't do that . You won 't tell him ? Not if you don 't want me to . I won 't do it again . Who is it ? Me . Where 's my yo-yo ? I 'll open the door . Wait . What about today ? What 're you talking about ? It 's not fair to forget . I don 't understand . Keep your promise or I 'll cut out your tongue . What promise ? You promised to buy me a yo-yo . I did ? You must be mistaken . What did he look like ? Was his face bandaged ? It 's you . When ? A while ago . See here . When I go out , my face is always bandaged . You remember that night ? That was the only time we met . A while ago . I really promised to buy you a yo-yo ? Don 't lie . What did he wear ? I forgot . How many rooms do I rent here ? One or ... ? If you don 't tell him ... I won 't tell on you . I haven 't much time today . Tomorrow , perhaps . Tomorrow ? Yes , I promise . You see it ? Yes . What 's it like now ? It 's plotting . Getting very fat . Be careful then . Leave it to me . I 'll give you a shot for your eyes . Thank you . Your wife again ... I know . You 're looking happy . Are you so content with the result ? Someone knew who you were ? Can you guarantee no one will ? I think I can . Even I was almost fooled . See ? Your mask can look serious , too . I 'm not worried . Unfortunately . Who knew ? Your wife ? A stranger . A girl I 'd only seen twice . Girl ? An idiot . Mentally retarded ? She saw me with bandages . Once with my mask on . A different suit but she knew . At the apartment house ... ? The super 's daughter . She didn 't see you changing ? No chance of her doing that . I 'm sure of it . I see . But you might not fool a dog either . A dog ? Perhaps she has an animal 's sense of smell . You 'd have to be pretty clever to tell any other way . How about a normal adult ? You 'd be safe even with an experienced detective . Why not test it by seeing an old friend ? I 'm sure of it . Your mask seems to have more character of its own today . How was it last night ? Nothing much . You mean you had your mask under control ? You 're too curious . Are you lying ? You must be more frank . You promised . Why ? Here 's the proof that you 're lying . Suit , necktie , shoes ... You 've never worn such loud things . Your former face , position , business ... No one could guess now . What you wear fits your mask . Your mask chose for you . It ordered your mind to select these things . Do you see ? Your mask is really affecting you . I felt I had to look the part . When you become confident enough , you 'll listen to your mask more . See someone , test it . I 'll expect you again tonight . I 'd like to see the Director about Mr. Okuyama . Your card , sir ? I have none . Your business , sir ? Have we met somewhere before by any chance ? I 'm sure we have . Where was it ? Am I mistaken ? I think so . Perhaps so . Are you going to announce me or not ? But you keep lying to me . I can 't see him ? About Mr. Okuyama ... Do you remember his face before the accident ? Of course . Actually , I 'm his younger brother . I 'll call the guard , if you say things like that . Well , I guess that 's that . I imagine you 're not married yet ? Have you got used to the mask ; or is the mask used to you ? You 're a great doctor , a specialist . You can foresee the future . Drunk ? Is that bad ? Fine . Am I easier to watch when I 'm high ? Exactly . Another for me , too . Let 's see now . Am I getting drunk , or is it the mask ? I 'd like an answer to that one . How would I know ? What about your new name and your plans for work ? Why ? Never mind , if you haven 't decided . The bandages will do fine for all that ... Isn 't the mask bound by such things ? The mask is to savor ordinary emotions . I wonder . The other day , two beers after a shot didn 't even affect you . Tonight , a beer and a half , with no drugs , and you 're tight . Understand ? It 's not the beer . The mask 's made you drunk . No ... You 're playing with word . Look . Everyone 's trying to get drunk . They can , because they don 't need to have an alibi . They can 't become somebody else . Yet , you can 't become just anybody . You 've an alibi for everything . Actually , it can 't be proved you 're really here . Getting drunk may well be a mask in itself . I see . A very clever challenge . But what 's your real motive ? You suggested I drink . Realize the difference between your first feelings and now . That 's all I want . Explain yourself . Have you forgotten ? I said wearing the mask equals jumping into zero gravity . Whereas you insisted it 's meaning to settle upon . I still do . Then what about it ? It 's neither your name nor job . Where will it lead you ? Shall I tell you ? Yes , do . I intend to seduce my wife . You 're not surprised ? I wasn 't wholly unprepared . I see . Congratulations . Will you tell me what will happen ? Will I succeed ? It 's dangerous . She 'll know ? Could be worse . I have the right to get back what 's mine . Will she return ? Tomorrow ... I 'll start out at four . I 've made plans . Tomorrow . I 've waited all this while . Thanks again . A dangerous triangle . Triangle ? I see . It 's triangle , you think ? It 's all right as long as I report you everything ? Yes , tell me everything . You promised . I feel more and more like a guinea pig . It can 't be helped ? The guessing game again ? No . After all , it won 't live much longer . What won 't ? The mask . Are you glad your prophecy 's come true ? But just in case ... If the mask borrows your body to live ... I am a guinea pig . I can mass produce them . A face , easily taken off . A world without family , friends or enemies . There 'll be no crimes because there 'll be no criminals . No one 'll want freedom because we 'll all be free . No one 'll run away because there 'll be no place to run from . Loneliness and friendship will be one . There 'll be no need for trust among people . There 'll be no suspicions or betrayals . Why didn 't you test it yourself then ? Even a doctor can 't dissect himself . I can 't back out now . Never mind . A world like that can 't exist . I think I know what you mean . Maybe it 's because I 'm always surrounded by cripples . We don 't know yet . You can 't conclude it until you hear the result . Did you drop this ? Oh , thank you . Will you have some tea ? I think there 's a shop along here . Damn . What ? Nothing . Didn 't you say , " Damn " ? Hardly . Noisy , isn 't it ? They do it purposely . It 's so people will leave and there 'll be a bigger turnover . I 've heard that somewhere . Yes , I imagine so . It was in some magazine . Are you working ? No , I go to a hobby-class to polish gems . That ring you dropped . Your wife 's ... ? What ? Her hobby . I have no wife . Your husband ? His hobby ? No . It doesn 't matter . You wouldn 't tell me anyway , but ... What ? What you do ? Why ? Is it a secret ? If I succeeded in hiding it , it would mean I 'm in earnest , wouldn 't it ? You 're ... Dogs can sense things even in the dark . But it doesn 't mean they 're more advanced than we are . I know that . They called me " Mrs. " Remember the sea at Nagasaki ? What 're they going to fish for ? Brother . Do I look pretty from your side ? Yes , you do . How pretty ? Too pretty . No report yet ... He 's doing something . Who 's killing whom ? One of the three . You figure it out . Mister . The yo-yo ? Our secret ? Of course . Over here . What a nice view . It 's just come to me . Did I seduce you or were you seduced ? You really live here ? It doesn 't smell a woman . Nor alike a man either . You 're used to smelling out things ? If you say so . People aren 't what they seem . But we should respect appearances . You think so ? You 'd be confident , too , you 'd think so , too . We 're two strangers about to commit adultery . Yes , I 'm ready . Without regret ? With too many of myself . The sea seems to be saying something . A war may start tomorrow . Will you kiss me ? I 'm sure there 'll be a war tomorrow . Forgive me . It 's too easy . It 's too simple . It doesn 't have to be complicated . I can 't stand it ! What are you doing ? You lewd woman ! Look at me ! Do you think I didn 't know ? You knew ? Of course . I thought we both knew we were going to a masquerade . How ? How did you know ? Do I have to tell you that ? Didn 't you think this mask is too good ? I was impressed . That 's why I made up layers on my face . You knew and ... Of course . I hoped for too much . I was ashamed , yet grateful . I thought the mask your consideration . In love , we all try to unmask one another . So I thought we should try to wear masks . You were the one who made the first move . I did not . It 's you who gave up . Just a minute now . Why not do it ever again ? No . It was only yesterday we talked . Women don 't hide the fact they use make-up . I can never stand with a mask pretending it 's real . But ... I 'm trying not to scream . I don 't treat the physically ill . I 'm a psychiatrist . I 've just filled the gap in mind . TO MY BROTHER I 'm no one . A complete stranger . Sunglasses . I 'm no one . Arrest me if you can . I 'm no one at all . What 're you saying ? This is no joke . What 'll you do about it ? Just a minute . I 'm questioning him . What 's this ? A doctor 's card ? Hori Psychiatric Clinic . The police . Hori speaking . Yes . That 's true . He ran away from here . Thank you . Dinner is ready . Yes , that 's right . I 'll be right over for him . No , he 's not violent . His personal effects . Be careful after this . I 'm sorry to have troubled you . I 'm not insane . I 'm a dangerous criminal . You can 't catch me . I know . I won 't let you go . Let 's go . Not you , Doctor . You know very well I 'm not crazy . Of course you 're not . I 'm really dangerous , officer . My beard 's itchy under the mask . What 's the idea ? I 'm not a charity case . I 'm not grateful ! The whole thing , crazy . Give me back my mask . You promised . You don 't understand . You 're not the only lonely man . Freedom 's always a lonely thing . Some masks come off , some don 't . You 're free . Be free . Thanks . I will .

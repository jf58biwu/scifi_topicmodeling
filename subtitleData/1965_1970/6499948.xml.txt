 ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) Prisoner : Where am I ? Man : In the village . What do you want ? Information . Whose side are you on ? That would be telling . We want information . Information ... Information ... You won 't get it . ( Bubbling ) By hook or by crook , we will . Who are you ? The new number two . Who is number one ? You are number six . I am not a number , I am a free man ! ( Number two laughs ) Number six : Now . Woman : A circle . Right . Now . A ... star . Right . Thank you , number six . What for ? For letting me practice my mind-reading act on you . Now . A square ... No , a cross . No , a square , definitely . You 're sure it 's a square ? Yes . I don 't know what I 'd have done without you . Nobody else believed in me . They have no imagination . You should concentrate . Otherwise you won 't be ready for the village festival . There 's still a month . Now ! A cross . Right . Now ? Three wavy lines . That 's the lot . Can I take another picture ? You 've taken five already . I need practice if I 'm to stand a chance in the photographic section . Is there any event you haven 't entered ? Only the pole vault , but I might . Bet you ... ow ! Oh ! I 'm terribly sorry . Did it hurt ? It 's a mortal injury . Wounded for life . Look . Oh , I 'm so sorry . It was clumsy of me . Don 't worry , it will mend itself . Can I still take the picture ? You 'll have to hurry up . 17 out of 25 is quite remarkable . Couldn 't it just mean that we 're ... simpatico ? It might , but there 's more to it than that . Out of the last four runs , you 've got 73 out of 100 . You 're gifted . Like it ? Well , as you say , you , uh ... Need a little more practice . Yes , I see what you mean . Could we try another ? What ? That 's all right . What do you want me to do ? Well , uh , uh , look this way . And ... put your hand to your face . Yes ... but not over your face , just to your ... Thinking ... Yes , that 's marvelous . Yes , I 'll keep this one for myself . Um , can we try another run with the cards ? No , no , it 's getting late . You 'll reduce your average and get discouraged . You care ? Don 't forget the cards . Tomorrow ? We 'll see . Tomorrow . ( Door buzzes ) See you . See you . Switch me into number six . Closer , and infrared . Breathing is shallow . Sleep is light . Let 's deepen it for him , shall we ? Pulsator . Visual . ( Rhythmic humming ) Oral . ( Sighs ) ( Zapping ) Left-handed , number 12 . ( Sighs ) ( Groans , mumbles ) ( Phone beeping ) Number two : Good morning , number 12 . I hope you slept well after your flight . I 'll expect you for breakfast in 15 minutes . Good morning , number 12 . Be seeing you . Morning , number 12 . Nice to see you again . Miss , why do you call me number 12 ? Well , that 's what you were called when I last saw you . ( Door buzzes ) Ah , my dear chap ! Delighted to see you . ( Chuckles ) You 're looking fine , you really are . I don 't mind telling you we had to pull every string we could in order to get you seconded back to us . Now , breakfast . A LA carte , table d 'hote . Oh ? Yes , they screamed as if I were taking their pensions away . Did they ? ( Chuckles ) Do you think I 'd forgotten we used to call you flapjack Charlie ? Even in those days it was obvious you were going to make a top field man . Here am I , stuck in admin . You always did enjoy your food . Even before a job from the black file . Sorry I didn 't shave . Couldn 't find a razor . Oh , my dear chap , I 'm so sorry . Must have been mislaid . Strange apartment . And after all that flying . You must feel a bit disorientated . Yes ... what 's it 's all about ? Our prize prisoner . The one we call number six . Toughest case I 've ever handled . I could crack him , of course but I can 't use the normal techniques . He 's too valuable . Mustn 't damage him permanently say our masters . That 's why I need you . Why do you need me ? You bring two great gifts to bear . Firstly your ability as an agent . Oh , yes . Secondly ? You have a unique physical advantage . Physical advantage of growing a mustache overnight ? ! ( Laughs ) No , not quite . You took longer that time in bucharest . Bucharest ? You remember how Susan hated you without it ? She told me she wouldn 't kiss you until you grew it again . Yes , good for Susan . You know , you really do bear a remarkable resemblance . Remarkable . Your job , number 12 , will be to impersonate him . Take his sense of reality away . Once he begins to doubt his own identity , he 'll crack . What do you think of the idea ? I think it has ... Fascinating possibilities but you 'll have an awful job convincing me that I am not your number six . Ah ... chuckles ) Excellent , number 12 ... of course . Always the professional . Started living the part already , eh ? Oh , that reminds me ... Allow me . You 're now officially ... Number six . I shan 't need this to remind me that I am ... Your number six . You 'll find all his background details in here . Study them . Uh , you want to watch that , number 12 . Number six is right-handed . Yes , we 'll just have to make a very few changes . Oh , don 't worry ... I 'll get a couple of my girls to work you over a little . But they 're very pretty . You 'd hardly know yourself , would you , number 12 ? ( Door buzzes ) Number two : This is number six 's . Familiarize yourself with it . I want you to look as much at home here as he does . That shouldn 't be too difficult . ( Chuckles ) The idea is that when he comes back ... in a few minutes , as a matter of fact ... you will be in possession . It 's not the same . The same ? You 've changed things . Little things . This rubbish . It 's nof mine . This should be gilt not silver . I shouldn 't try that line with him if I were you . Number six has got a very strong sense of territory . You won 't shake him on his possessions . No , you won 't . Mm-hmm . Oh , um , once we get started even I won 't be able to tell you apart . You 'll need a password to identify yourself . The password is gemini . Well , yes , he should be here in a minute . I think it 's more effective if you meet him alone . Oh , uh ... good luck . ( Door buzzes ) ( Door buzzes ) ( Man whistling ) What the devil ... ? Oh , very good . Very , very good indeed . One of number two 's little ideas , I suppose ? Where did they get you ... a people 's copying service ? Or are you one of those double agents we hear so much about these days ? Seeing that you 've gone to so much trouble the least I can do is offer you a drink . Scotch . I take it I 'm supposed to go all fuzzy around the edges and run off into the distance screaming " who am I ? " Probably ... no idea . Would you like some ice ? Thank you . I think it spoils it myself . Yes ... I always keep it in that thermos bucket over there . You know , I never realized I had a freckle on the right-hand side of my nose . When they come to film my life story , you 've got the part . Cigar ? Oh , you 'll , um , have to learn to smoke it right-handed first . And you how to light a cigar . ( Coughing ) And you how to smoke my brand without having a heart attack . There 's some black Russian cigarettes in the box there on the table . I never touch them myself . It 's not going to work , you know . Certainly isn 't . Why don 't you run away and play somewhere else ? I have a very strong sense of identity . You ... oh , yes , of course , I 'm sorry . I was forgetting you 're supposed to be me . You are the goody number six and I am the baddy who is supposed to be proving you wrong , is that it ? That 's right , except there 's no supposed about it . I 'll tell you what . Um ... why don 't we settle this like gentlemen ? Oh , you 're claiming to be a gentleman , too ? Oh , very good , very good , indeed . That line is worthy of me . We 're both claiming to be number six , are we not ? I am number six , you are doing the claiming . Well , let 's prove which one is correct . How ? Oh , many ways . Pistol-shooting , for instance . What was number six 's average ? 90 percent . Correct . Shall we go ? Where ? The recreation room . Don 't wish to take unfair advantage . Check synchronization . One ... Two ... three . Good . Electronic , you see ? No bullets . Can 't kill anyone with them . Number two takes no chances . Three-second intervals all right ? Whatever you say . I 'm , uh , sorry , old boy . Um , number six is a right-handed shot . Good . Ready to go now . Three-second intervals . Now , one , two , three . ( Zapping ) It 's uncanny . Number 12 has caught the man 's whole style . In Haiti , we 'd say he has stolen his soul . Well , I certainly shoot more like me than you do . What does all that prove ? That you should have put in more shooting practice before you took on this job . How 's your fencing ? You should know , you 've studied my file . Turning the tables ... Very neat . " These foils have all a length ? " " Aye , my good lord . " Hamlet , act five . Scene two . You have done your homework , haven 't you ? No , you 've done yours . Even the Shakespeare bit . ( Both chuckle ) Oh , yes , good agricultural stuff but hardly have got you my place on the ... olympic ... team ! No swordsman , no shot , either . If ever ... If ever you do challenge me to a duel your safest bet would be battle axes in a very dark cellar . Uh , you ... you still claim to be number six ? It 's beginning to get on my nerves a little bit . I suppose you 're an olympic boxer as well , are you ? Oh , you should know , it 's in my record . Perhaps you 'd like to ... Find out . So now ... Come on , make up your mind . Are you , uh , orthodox or southpaw ? ( Grunts ) I 'm surprised at number two . His agents just aren 't what they were . ( Roaring ' ) Oh , dear . Looks as though we 're in trouble with the headmaster . Must be confusing for it not knowing which one of us to bite . This way . Number six . Come along in . Heard you were having a spot of bother . ( Beeping , zapping ) Who are you ? ( Tensely ) : Switch that idiot thing off . I 'm getting cramp . Who are you ? You know who I am . I am number six ! Where did you come from ? You know that , too . How did you get here ? You know that better than I do . I was unconscious at the time , if you remember ! What was your purpose in coming here ? I had none . I 'll go away again if you like ! How did your people know that number six was here ? What people ? How did they know enough to produce you ? ! I do not understand ! ( Higher-pitched beeping ) What were you doing in the recreation room ? Teaching that synthetic twin of mine how to shoot and fence ! ( Louder beeping ) For the last time ... What do your people want with number six ? ! I am number six . I ... am ... number six . Number six ... Six ! Six ! Six ! Six ! ( Beeping stops ) Hmm ... your boy is dedicated to his work . I told you he was a tough nut , number 12 . No , no , six ... Number six . Oh , you 're quite right , of course . That was careless of me . He might have heard . ( Muttering ) : Six ... Six ... Do you still insist you 're number six ? Yes ... Your mind can lie but your body can 't . You 'll see . By the time we finish with him he won 't know whether he 's number six or the cube root of infinity . Now , this should be rather interesting . We have a complete set of number six 's fingerprints . Yes , I know my own fingerprints . Let 's start with the thumb , shall we ? That 's mine . Never off duty , are you ? And I suppose you know your fingerprints , too ? Yes ... That 's mine . So that if I say that , on the contrary it belongs to number six , one of us is lying . Not at all . As I am number six , we 'd both be telling the truth . Let 's find out , shall we ? There , that 's my thumb . Now it 's your turn . Right thumb only , I think . Simple ... foolproof . Too simple and foolproof . Oh ? Very ingenious . And scientific . The trouble with science is that it can be perverted . I 'm inclined to agree , number two . You agree ? I 'm inclined to believe in human instinct . How do you mean ? Well , I mean that ... If I were in his shoes I 'd rather be convinced by a human being than by a piece of machinery . You have something in mind ? Certainly . May I ? Oh ... Number 24 . Alison ? Yes ? I 'm at number two 's residence . Could you come over right away ? I was just going to wash my hair . Don 't worry about that , won 't take a minute . And , Alison ... Bring the cards with you . What do you hope to achieve ? To prove that I am number six and he is a fake . That 's what you wanted , isn 't it ? That 's what it 's all about , hmm ? Yes . ( Door buzzes ) Good heavens , it can 't be . Mother nature has been up to her tricks again . It 's weird ... I mean , which one of you ... I am the original . He is the economy pack . But it 's impossible . On the contrary . But I still don 't understand which of you is ... That is what you are here to settle . Number two says it 's not possible . Oh , I see , that 's why you wanted me to bring the cards . That 's right . I don 't follow . Number six and I have a mental link . Yes , now let 's see which one of us you have a mental link with . I think a run of five should be sufficient . Right . Now . Square . Now . Circle . Now . Cross . Steady ... Just , just relax . It 's exactly the same as it was in my cottage . I 'm ... looking at the next card now . You ready ? Cross . Now ? Three wavy lines . Now . A square . A run of five , you said , did you ? Good . Now . Three wavy lines . Now . A cross . Now . Star . Now . A circle . Now . A square . You don 't have to tell me I just know that was five out of five . He 's the one ... he 's number six . I could have identified myself much earlier but it would hardly have been fair . Isn 't it awful ? I took it last night . He 's all arms and legs . Actually , there was a much simpler way to identify number six . He has a mole on his left wrist . Oh , yes , of course . So does this one , my dear . There , you see ? Well , if you gentlemen are finished for today if you don 't mind , I 'll see the young lady home . Be seeing you . What in heaven 's name made you do a stupid thing like that ? Surely you must realize that number six and that girl have got a genuine rapport . Someone 's going to have to pay dearly for this . Number 118 ! Why was there no mole on number 12 's left wrist ? I said why was there no mole ? ! Don 't you realize you 've jeopardized the whole operation ? Report to me first thing in the morning . First thing ! ( Man laughing ) My dear chap ... There was a much simpler way to identify number six . He has a mole on his left wrist . Number two : Who are you ? Alison : He 's the one ... He 's number six . ( Mad laughter ) He 's cracking , number 12 . Won 't be long now . The left hand number 12 . ( Zapping ) Your left hand . It 's always left ... That 's right . Now catch ! ( Zapping ) Number six ( Dazed ) : I am ... number 12 . I am ... left-handed . I am number 12 . I do not ... smoke cigars . I do not smoke white cigarettes . I smoke ... black cigarettes . Black cigarettes . I smoke ... flapjacks are my favorite dish . Flapjacks ... Favorite dish . ( Electrical crackling ) Number " b : Don 't forget , number 'b , you 're now left - handed . You 're now left-handed . Zapping , shouts ) ( Roaring ' ) ( Whooshing , whining ) Enough . Let 's see how number six is getting on , shall we ? Number six ? Control room , number six is gone . Find him . The atmosphere is very different here from what it was elsewhere . What 's the password ? Gemini . That 's not the password . ( Roaring ' ) ( Whooshing , whining ) ( Phone beeps ) Yes ? Control room here . Negative search results so far . No trace of him yet , sir . Send out a general alarm . Orange alert . ( Door buzzes ) I 'm a very light sleeper . It 's in my file . Five-yard range . Nerve gas . One squirt , you 're paralyzed . Two squirts , you 're dead . ( Dazed ) : Couldn 't sleep . Came here because ... Who am I ? You know who you are . You 're number 12 . Yes ... yes ... I 'm number 12 ... Sometimes ... in my dreams ... I 'm ... I 'm somebody else . Who ? I don 't know . Sometimes in my dreams , I ... Resign my job . Why did you resign your job ? In your dream ? Sometimes I 'm here in my dreams and I come back . I wonder now ... Who am I ? Why am I here ? I think we 'll call number two . He might be able to help . The password ! I don 't know what ... I don 't know what you 're talking about . What is it ? What password ? What is it ? Schizoid ... schizoid man . Schizoid man . What 's your name ? Curtis . Give me your left wrist . You won 't get far . Won 't I ? We 'll see about that . ( Roaring ' ) ( Whooshing , whining ) Schizoid man . Schizoid man . Schizoid man . Schizoid man . ( Roaring ' ) ( Panting ) Screaming y get me number two . Curtis here . Password ? Schizoid man . Number six is dead . What ? ! He 's dead . Rover got him . Control room ! Deactivate Rover immediately pending further instruction . ( Door buzzing ) We 're still trying to discover why Rover killed number six . There 's going to be hell to pay . Mm-hmm . You 're to return immediately to report your failure . My failure ? You wanted him broken , I 've broken him . I wasn 't to know he 'd go berserk . Nor was I. You studied him , you should have known . It was your idea . That 's a strange thing to say . You know it wasn 't . Well , you certainly didn 't resist . Bearing in mind its origin , no , I didn 't . Nor did you . Recriminations aren 't going to help . It 's a disgrace for us both . When do I leave ? Half an hour . Oh , they , uh , they want you to talk to the girl Alison before you go . Yes ? What for ? They think she may have some insight into number six 's motivations . Oh ... ( Knock on door ) Come in . Just leaving . I thought we ought to have a little chat . Oh ? You 're supposed to have had a certain rapport with number six . My masters will want to know if you had any insight into his mind . Insight ? Yes , I ... I don 't believe in such things myself , but , um ... You were supposed to be able to read each other 's minds . It doesn 't work like that . Ah ... How does it work ? In , uh , spasms . Little things . Sudden coincidences which aren 't really coincidences . Ah ? Bad habit of mine , playing with lighters . ( Chuckles ) I 'll probably start a fire one day . Well , you 've nothing to tell me . I 'll be on my way . Be seeing you . You ready ? Yes , just coming . Oh , by the way , have you thought any more about that proposition I put to you when you arrived ? Sorry , I 've had no time . But you must have some views ? I 'm afraid not . Look , old chap , we 've been through many scrapes before but we 've never fallen out over them . The general 's not going to behead you . We won 't know until I 've reported to the general , will we ? Report to the general ? That 's a new one . Well , I don 't mean report to him personally . For Pete 's sake , you ... You know what I mean . You are edgy . Never known you quite so strung up . You mean I 'm not as I was ? Yes . I remember Susan saying only a month ago that you 're generally quite unflappable . You have changed . We all change . The job . It changes us . Yes . It 's a quick flip in the helicopter to the landing strip and you pick up a jet from there . Oh , excuse me . I 'm ashamed of what I did to number six yesterday . Why are you telling me ? Everyone has to tell someone . It was your job . It was a betrayal . Isn 't everything we do here a betrayal ? It 's not often one gets a second chance . There are no second chances . There are sometimes for the lucky ones . If I had a second chance , I want you to know that I wouldn 't do it again . Well , bon voyage . Thank you . Oh , one last thing . You forgot security regulations . Must be obeyed . The blindfold , old chap . Oh , yes , yes , of course . You , uh , you won 't forget to give Susan my regards , will you ? I won 't . Good-bye . Good-bye . Susan ... Died a year ago , number six . ( Slam echoes )

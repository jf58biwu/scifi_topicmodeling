 Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on Americas greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony ewman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . Where are we ? Could be anywhere . That sun up theres our immediate enemy . - Weve got to find cover . - Letss get into those rocks . Itd be like a furnace on this desert . Well , maybe we can get to the mountains . In this heat , wed never make it . Doug , if we stand here , well fry ! - Come on , Tony . Help me . - What are you doing ? A few inches below this surface , the grounds ten degrees cooler . Well dig a couple of pits and lie in them till the sun goes down . I hope were not digging our own graves . Thats no good . Itss too hot and too hard . Weve gotta find something to dig with , and quick . Tony ! Tony . ! Come here . ! They dont look too friendly . Maybe youre right . Wedd better find some cover . Come on . What do you want with us ? Weve done nothing to you . Tony . ! The Time Tunnel . Hes dead . Tonyss dead ! Come on , now . Hold on , Ann . He cant be dead . If he were , we couldnt keep a fix on him . - Yes , thats true , isntt it ? - Whatsss your time fix , Ann ? Uh , 1886 , middle of May . Wait . Youre losing the picture . Oh , its no use . The spatial fix is changing , and theress no way to stop it . Tonys dead . Dead , gentlemen ! Dead . If we lose India , it means the death of the British Empire . I know , gentlemen . I know . Here in London , these matters may seem remote . But they are no less real and immediate . A revolt is already brewing along the northern borders . - It could break out at any moment . - Mr. Gladstone , I disagree . I believe that I speak for more than one member of this cabinet . If a revolt were to break out ... a mere handful of mountain tribesmen ... could never stand up to Her Majestys regulars . They would be crushed , sir , in short order . - Sir . - Hear , hear . We are not dealing with a handful of mountain tribesmen , as you put it . These northern borders are seething with unrest . If the tribes should unite , all the troops we have in India ... could not prevent their sweeping south to engulf the whole country . Well , then , we must put more troops into the field ! But there is no time . Were not talking about months , sir . The crisis is at our door . It could come to a head within a few weeks . Then youre telling us theress nothing to be done ? On the contrary . Our best hope is to pray for more time to strengthen our forces ... while doing everything within our power ... to forestall any attempts by those tribes to unite . That is an impossible task , sir . Besides , there is nowhere to start . Ah , but there is . Our most dangerous opponent is a certain very ruthless tribal leader called Hira Singh . His stronghold is here . A most strategic position . Contain Hira Singh , and we can prevent the uprising . Well , there must be garrisons in the area . One , sir . One fort . And that badly in need of reinforcement . If Singh attacks , theyll be overwhelmed . In short , gentlemen , India will be saved or lost ... right here , at the gates of the Khyber Pass . - Its congee . - What ? Its rice water . Itss the best thing in the world for you . Hey , take it easy . Too much of thats gonna make you good and sick . Lets , uh - Letss get you back against this rock . Youre lucky thatss Just a scalp wound . - Where did you come from ? - From the fort . - What fort ? - Fort Albert , of course . Then , if youre a stranger , you wontt have heard of it . Its not much of a fort , really . Itss more of an outpost . How did you get here ? Its hard to answer . I dontt even know where I am . Oh , well , just beyond that border over there - Those are the Afghanistan Mountains . Then this is India . I say , you are lost , arent you ? - What year is it ? - Year ? Um , look . Youll be all right once we get back to the fort . Do you think you can mount ? - I think so . - Splendid . Lets give it a try then . I think its going to be a bit awkward , but welll manage . Well just take it slowly at first . - By the way , the year is 1886 . - Thanks . - I didnt catch your name . - Newman . Anthony Newman . Oh . Im Kipling . Imm a journalist . - Kipling ? - Yes . Rudyard Kipling . Shall we go ? I bring water for the prisoner . Over here . Congee . You drink . Thank you . - Thank you . - Later I bring you food . Wait a minute . Whats your name ? - Kashi , sahib . - Kashi , where am I ? What is this place ? You called me sahib . It must be India . Afghanistan . India is where you were captured . Whos holding me prisoner ? You can tell me that much . - Hira Singh . - Who ? Hira Singh , most powerful chieftain of all the border . - Is that good ? - For you , sahib ? No . Whats this ? Congee for the prisoner . - Who told you to speak to the prisoner ? - No one , sahib . Useless dog . Wait ! I have plans for the English pig . You ! Get out ! Tie him up . - Any luck ? - Nothing . The trouble must have something to do with the spatial fix . Why else would we shift to London when Doug and Tony landed over 1,000 miles away ? Well , Ray will find the trouble , Im sure . You dont think the problem might be right here in this console ? No . No , theres nothing wrong with the settings . Ivve checked them a dozen times . All circuits are operating . We cant find anything wrong . Oh , if we could just regain contact , even for a few seconds . We cant . Wevve tried everything . I dont understand . It just doesntt make sense . Weve never lost complete contact without some reasonable answer . Theres one explanation . Idd just as soon not think of it . Any explanations better than none . What is it ? Our instruments would act this way under one condition I can think of . All right , Ray . Out with it . IfTony and Doug were dead . Not too much of that . Weve got nearly an hour to go . - Hows your head feeling ? - Still sore . Im all right . Letss go . Oh , now listen . Weve got to rest the horse for a while anyway . In this country , youve got to learn to conserve your strength . Beastly country . Enough to fry a mans brains . Now , then . You say these brigands rode off with your friend ? And left me the way - way you found me . That sounds like Hira Singhs work . Whos he ? Where can we find him ? Wherever theres trouble . And if yourre thinking of dashing off to save your friend , forget it . - And let those people kill him ? - Oh , no . Weve got to try and save him , of course . - But we need help , and lots of it . - The fort ? Exactly . Itll take at least a full troop of cavalry . ow , the colonel in command is not the brightest chap Ive ever met ... but , well , I think hes a good soldier , and Imm sure hellll pitch in . I think we better get a move on again . They cant be dead ! I wontt believe it without absolute proof . No radiation readings . There havent been for some time . This is the longest weve gone without contact since we began operations . - Hows your power output ? - Optimum . Troubless not there , Immm sorry to say . Then , Ann , how else can you explain it ? The trouble could be environmental interference of some sort . - Theres no indication of it . - But itss a possibility . That must be the answer . Youre refusing to admit , even to yourself that they both could have been killed . I know theyre alive , General . It must be something else . It has to be . I hope youre right . But do you have any way to establish it ? - Ray ? - At the moment , no . Neither do I. I said talk . Talk ! I dont know anything about the fort . Youre very stubborn , even for an Englishman . Ive told you . Imm not English . Immm an American . Im not deceived by your feeble lie . Tell the truth , and your death will be a much easier one . You are a spy from the fort . But what is your mission ? - What were you sent to learn ? - Nothing . Im exactly what I said I was . How dare you insult my intelligence with a wild tale of traveling in time . You call us savages . You treat us like children . But were intelligent men . The truth ! That is the truth . Now you go ahead and do what you want to with me . I will . You may rely on that . Only I had hoped you would choose to die without a lie in your throat . But still , it is of no real importance to me . - What are you going to do ? - Kill you , naturally . You will die painfully and slowly . Afterwards , you will be tied to a horse . The animal will carry you to the fort where they will react with righteous horror ... to what I have done to one of their countrymen . And just what possible good is that going to do you ? Oh , a great deal of good . Because I have come to understand your kind so well ... I can picture the outrage on your colonels face . He will call us bloody savages and swear revenge against us . He will send soldiers to carry out his threat . But they will never reach our camp . An ambush . With half the garrison dead , the fort will no longer be strong . And then will come the night I have dreamed of these many years . The night of the long knives . My men will strike silently and swiftly . If you massacre the fort ... the British will track you down in the hills and destroy you . You English do us little credit . The night of the long knives ... is only a signal to begin a general uprising all along these borders . Every tribe from here to the east will spring into action ... driving south like hungry locusts . When it is all finished , there will not be one foreigner left alive in all of India . It will begin in exactly two days . Now that you have learned the information for which youve been sent ... - what do you think of my plan ? - I think youre a madman . Im sorry you cannot be permitted to live long enough to see it all fulfilled . But , of course , that would be impossible . Honored One - Have patience . My scouts have brought me news . They have spotted a train of wagons heading toward Fort Albert . Wagons-That means supplies for the garrison . The wagon train will go through the pass . We must ambush it . What of your prisoner , sire ? I have a new plan for him . We will use him as a hostage . Get the men together . We will set up the trap at once . Kashi ! It will suit my purpose to let you live a little while longer . See that the prisoner is fed and given water to drink . Hira Singh , eh ? Troublesome beggar . I dont doubt for a moment hess behind this business . Look , Colonel , we need a rescue expedition to go in there immediately before hes killed . I daresay you do , sir . However , the decision happens to be mine . Colonel , do you mean youre going to let this man Phillips be murdered ? I dont wish to see anyone murdered , sir . However , I command a small force here . And its function is not to go rushing off wildly in all directions ... every time some traveler permits himself to be captured . Excuse me , sir , but I think youre making a grave mistake . - Youve got to rescue him . - Kipling . As a journalist , you get pretty much of a free hand here . But Im hanged if Illl let the press tell me what I must or must not do . - Colonel , all hes trying to tell you - - Newman , Illl handle it . You will handle nothing that has to do with my troops . Before you get any angrier , sir ... let me tell you something that may save your career ... and your life . Do you want to see this border aflame from the Himalayas to the Arabian Sea ? Ill answer to the queen for my actions , sir , not to your bloody newspaper . Youll have insurrection on your hands . All-out civil war . Because I refuse to risk my entire garrison to save a single man ? Precisely . But if youve made up your mind , then theress nothing more to be said . - Good day , sir . Come along , Newman . - Kipling ! Come back here . Now , lets get something straight . I know all about this growing unrest , this talk about a general uprising against us . aturally , I am doing everything in my power to prevent it . By the same token , I will commit no rash act that may bring it about . - Thats all . - And your decision ? I said thats all , sir . Major Kabir ! - Sir ? - Has Troop D been alerted ? Yes , sir . As you ordered . Does the colonel plan to cancel the alert ? Certainly not ! Whatever gave you such an idea ? Excuse me , sir , but I heard you shouting at Mr. Kipling and the other man . Theyre civilians , man . Do you think I should inform them as to what I do or do not plan to do ? - No , sir . - Very well . Inform Troop D to proceed with the planned sortie at once . Yes , sir . At once . - Any luck yet , General ? - No . Sir , Ive been going over this problem in my mind . Idd like to make a suggestion . Fine . Go ahead . Im listening . Well , first of all , I dont believe Doug and Tony are dead . The only time we saw Tony , he looked either dead or dying . But what if he is still alive ? What if he needs immediate medical help ? We cant get contact . Wevve tried everything . Theres one thing we haventt tried . - You mean sending somebody back to help ? - Thats right , sir . Someone with a knowledge of our operations here ... and with training in emergency first aid . Sorry , its impossible . - General , Id like to do it . - No . This is no time to play it safe . Weve got to start taking chances . I agree . But taking a chance implies a possibility of success . Without contact , theres no way we could place anyone within a hundred years ofTony and Doug . Forget about it , jerry , and concentrate on regaining our fix . Yes , sir . Anyway , thanks for the offer . - What did he say ? - I didnt ask . Didnt ask ? They dontt even know what he looks like . That means we have to stay here at the fort while they rescue Doug . Not at all . I didnt ask simply because I was afraid that hedd say no . - You know , civilians interfering in a military matter and so on . - Ill ask him myself . I wouldnt do that if I were you . Count yourself lucky he ordered the attack . - Besides , theres a better way . - How ? Well , we cant go as civilians , but we can go as troopers . - Uniforms . - Right . Lets jump into them , shall we ? - Wed better hurry . Theyrre leaving . - What about horses ? Ive made arrangements for them . Theyrre over there , saddled and ready . - Can you ride ? - Come on . Whoa . The supply train for the fort . Where have they gone ? Its all right , you dontt have to tell me . I already know . I overheard them planning an ambush . Something about a supply train on its way to Fort Albert . Where is Fort Albert ? To the southeast . An hours ride . - o more . - What kind of troops do they have there ? British ? Yes . - Is there any way I could reach them ? - No . Sahib , they have left guards around the camp . We must speak carefully . You risked your life for me , sahib . I couldnt stand there and watch him beat you . He will make you pay for what you did . Hes going to kill me anyway . I can only die once . He will make it seem a hundred times . Im going to help you escape . - If you do , theyll kill you . - No . I will get away too . Are you sure ? My mind is decided . These eyes , too , could once see . This is the work of Hira Singh . Now he thinks I am without brains , without feeling , as well as without eyes . There is a horse you can take , but there is not much time . Hira Singh and his men will return soon . You must take the small trail . Very steep , very rocky , very dangerous . I can make it . - What about you ? - I know every inch of these mountain trails . I will make my way on foot , by a way they will never discover . And after that ? Someday , when it is safe , I will make my way to your fort . Go now ... with great speed . Someday , Ill thank you for what youvve done here . Go , quickly ! Kashi . Come with me . No . Then we will both be caught . Go alone . I will follow in my own way . Go ! Quick ! General , I have that possibility you spoke of . We cant make contact because we dontt have enough power on the coordinates . - Right ? - Right . Weve known that all along . What if we bypass the breaker system ? Put one concentrated surge of power into the Tunnel . I cant permit that . We could damage the Tunnel beyond the possibility of all repair . - Or we could regain our fix . - No , no . Its altogether too risky , jerry . Whats your opinion , Ann ? If it doesnt work , it means losing contact with them forever . Weve already lost it . Well , go ahead and tell them , General . Tell them if we - if were gonna get them back , we have to take chances . Ray , he may be right . General , Im opposed . The risks are too great . But , its your decision . Im sorry , jerry . No . The Englishman got away with the help of this dog . How do you want him killed ? With great skill . - Wait . Do we have an English uniform in camp ? - Several . Get one . Put him in it . It will be a fine insult to our British friends . At once . Old man , you will regret the day you were born . Colonel , Ive looked all over the fort . Kiplingss missing . So Ive been told . Itss his own fault and yours . You had no more business on that expedition than you have in that uniform . - Ive a good mind to put you under arrest . - Thatss your privilege , Colonel . But youve got to do something about Phillips and Kipling . Theyrre probably both prisoners . Well , I dont know about Kipling , but I have some word about Phillips . - Is he dead ? - Major Kabir , send in that man , please . Tony ! I couldnt believe it when they told me you were alive . - How did you get away ? - Thats a long story . Tell me , whats all this that Ivve heard about a , uh , man named Kipling ? Thats right . Itss the same one . Colonel , weve got to get to him . Well , you and young Kipling did have some small part ... in my decision to send out the rescue expedition . Without it , our entire supply train would have been lost . I suppose I owe you something but Kipling was almost certainly killed in that battle . But if he wasnt ? If hess a prisoner ? Major , what would happen to young Kipling as Singhs prisoner ? He would be better off dead , sir . Exactly . All right , Major , be good enough to assign our guests sleeping quarters . - Colonel , I - - Good night , gentlemen . Where are those wagons going , Major ? The colonel is sending them back for more supplies . You people must need them pretty badly . Well , supplies are useful , Mr. Newman . Your colonel doesnt realize what a jam hess in . I tried to warn him when I first got here , but he just wouldnt believe me . - Warn him ? About what ? - An uprising . Its due to erupt any moment now ... and it could affect all of India . And hes not going to do anything ? Well , he sent for supplies and reinforcements . What else can he do ? Unfortunately , thats no good . There just isntt enough time . Whos that ? The man tied to that horse had this on him . A note from Hira Singh . Your friend Kipling is his prisoner . Youll order an expedition to rescue him at once , of course . Im sorry , ewman . He was warned , as you were . He had no business risking his life . Colonel , Id like to know more about that man tied to the horse . Poor old man . More dead than alive . - Old man ? - A blind man . Where is he ? At the post infirmary , if hes still living . Kashi . Kashi ? I do not have ... much time . You must listen . They caught me before I could get away . - Tortured me . - Theyll pay for it . - Ill see to it . - They know how weak the fort is . They know that supplies will not come ... for a long time . Hira Singh has made his decision . They will attack . - You will all be killed . - When ? Tomorrow . The night of the long knives . You must attack tonight . Surprise them . It is the only way . The only way . Sahib . What is it ? What happened ? Its a power surge . But where did it come from ? The image screen ! Look ! Weve got it ! Theyrre alive ! Both of them ! Whatever you do , dont lose them again . No . The fix is getting stronger . We can hold on to it this time . There must be something you can do . I know those people . Hell never get out alive . Cant you afford to release just one troop ? One quick surprise attack ? No ! Absolutely no . My decision is final . Colonel , you could prevent a famous man from being killed . Famous ? My dear sir , that young mans sole claim to fame ... is the fact that his family is not unknown here in India . Thats about all the fame hess ever likely to achieve . Colonel , you can forget about Kipling if you want to ... but youve got to start thinking about your own command . Tomorrow will be the night of the long knives . This garrison will be wiped out . And after that , all of India will be in revolt . Thats enough ! I want no advice on strategy from a pair of civilians . - Major Kabir ! - Yes , sir ? Escort these gentlemen from my office . Dont bother , Major . Werre just leaving . - Now , just a minute , I want to - - Youre wasting your time . Oh , uh , one moment , Major . You know , those chaps are right . Singh is planning that revolt for tomorrow night . Well , sir , among my troops , its already common knowledge . You feel the only way to prevent it is to attack tonight ? - Yes , sir , I do . - Unhappily , I cant do that . I dont understand , sir . I have a confidential message here , direct from Whitehall . It warns of the same explosive situation . It also orders me to take nothing but defensive measures . You realize what that means ? Yes , sir . You cannot attack . Exactly . Your own troops , Major , are brilliant fighters . Theyve only one weakness - a tendency to ignore official orders - to go off on wild forays of their own . Uh , yes , sir , Colonel , but , um , I assure you that - No , no , no , Major , I ... dont need any assurances . I wouldnt dream of trying to change them . - That would be a terrible thing to happen , sir . - Yes , wouldnt it ? Thats all , Major . Thank you , sir . You have troops for an expedition ? The finest fighters in the world , Mr. Newman , at my command . - All volunteers . - Why would these men be willing to do a thing like this ? Because they know as well as you do , if Singh is not defeated by tonight ... the great rebellion will begin . And if we do not kill them , they will kill us . Well , like it or not , were going with you . Like it ? I insist upon it . Mr. Phillips , you were at their camp . We can use you as a guide . Major , what if Colonel Fettretch finds out ? - Have no fear about that . - Okay . Good . Now , if you gentlemen will follow me , I will provide you with uniforms . We leave in one half hour . - Where are they holding Kipling ? - Probably that tent near the center of the camp . - Thats where they kept me . - Itss gonna be hard to reach him once the attack starts . Almost impossible . Look , theres only one thing to do . Ill go first. ow , you give me about a 30-second head start ... and then you signal Major Kabir to start the attack . Can you make it past all those sentries ? I think so . At any rate , weve got to risk it . Good luck . Shh . Ill get you out of here . On your feet ! On your feet ! You should never have surrendered , gentlemen . Before Im through with you , youlll regret that error . Start with him . Whats wrong with you chaps ? Theyrre waiting for you at the reviewing stand . - Come on . - And face the colonel again ? No , thank you . - Hed probably throw us in the jug . - Not on your life . The old chaps as happy as could be . Why , the threat of an uprising is over , and Hira Singh is dead . Well , just the same , well pass . Well , in that case , Id , uh , better get him to order you over . Wait here . Colonel ? I thought you said they were here . Well they , uh , they were a second ago . - Its incredible . - Theress absolutely no place they could have gone to . No , there isnt . An amazing pair , Colonel . Absolutely amazing . Come on . Come on ! I have a consignment here to deliver . I am one hour late . Here are my orders .

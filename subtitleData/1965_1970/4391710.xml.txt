 Good morning , Professor . I said , good morning , Professor . * * ( eerie whirring ) ( eerie whirring ) * * ( coins clank into phone ) David ... they 're here . ( no audio ) Julian ! Julian , are you all right ? Julian ! ( echoing ) : Julian ! What is it ? Are you all right , Julian ? Julian ! ( echoing ) : Julian ! Are you all right , Julian ? ( eerie tapping sound ) Julian ! Are you all right , Julian ? Julian ! ( tapping stops ) ( eerie whirring ) ( body hits ground ) NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The Invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the Invaders are here , that they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Joanne Linville ... Donald Haren ... Kent Smith ... and special guest star Charles Aidman . NARRATOR : Professor Julian Reed , a member of David Vincent 's group of believers has been hospitalized as insane . But is he a victim of the aliens or of his own mind ? ( doorbell rings ) Hi , Pat . I 'm sorry . Very , very sorry . Oh , it 's so good to see you , David . Come on in . David ... this is our son , Frankie . Frankie . Nice to meet you . How are you ? Fine , sir . Good . Mr. Vincent going to be spending a few days with us . Listen , Pat , I know you 're having a rough time , so if I 'm in the way- - please . Oh , no . Nonsense . How 's Julian ? Hey , isn 't it past your bedtime ? Sure , Mom . Pleased to meet you , Mr. Vincent . Thank you . See you tomorrow . Okay . Good night , darling . FRANKIE : Good night . ( door closes ) You needn 't have come , David , you know ? There 's really nothing that you can do . How bad is he ? Oh , I don 't ... I don 't believe that he 's , uh ... insane . I just think he 's ... just emotionally tired , that 's all . How did it happen ? I 'd rather not go into it right now . Sit down , David . Pat , I have to know . But I can 't ! Just ... just give me a day or two , all right , David ? I 'm sorry . Where is he ? In Brookside . David . Hi , Julian . I 'm glad to see you . How do you feel ? A lot better , thanks . I had a few wild hours there . Hallucinating , overtones of paranoia ... It 's all over , thank God . How long you been here ? Couple of weeks . Still hazy about a few things . You mind sitting over there ? You suspect him ? I suspect everyone . ( sighs ) When they told me I had a visitor , I thought it might be Pat . How is she and how 's Frankie ? Haven 't you seen them ? Well , Pat is very busy with her work , I guess . Well , they 're , uh ... fine . And Frankie and I are getting to be friends . They 're fine . David ... it 's no accident that I 'm here . The psychosis that I had was induced deliberately . They used the dream machine . I , uh ... I 'm not sure I know what that is . What 's a dream machine ? Well , it 's at the core of the project that I 'm involved in now . How much do you know about the Slaton Research Center ? Just what I 've read in the papers and magazines . What 's the expression they use ? Uh ... it 's a think factory . John Slaton has gathered together some of the finest minds in the country to think out problems relating to our space program . Much of it is highly secret . Now , I 'm not sure whether the aliens are merely observing or actively interfering , but some of the projects have already been canceled . So you , uh ... think they 're here . I 'm sure of it . My assistant , Jeff Brower , is one of them . He knows that I found out about aliens being at Slaton . And tried to discredit you by ... driving you out of your mind . I 'll get on it right away . I wish I could be out of here and helping you . ( heavy sigh ) We haven 't got much time , David . Find John Slaton . Warn him . Okay . Take care of yourself , hmm . The aliens are the result of Julian 's sick mind , not the cause . Well , I just had a talk with him . He 's as rational as you or I. You should 've heard him two days ago . He 'd begun using himself in his experiments , and I guess they just got away from him . Mr. Vincent ... accept it as a tragic accident . Is it logical that a man like Julian Reed would put himself in a position where he 'd be driven insane , even accidentally ? ( soft chuckle ) Scientists are a strange breed , Mr. Vincent . In their zeal for knowledge , they 'll push themselves beyond normal limits . To the extent of playing Russian roulette with their sanity ? Yes . Look at Pasteur . He risked a hideous , painful death by injecting himself with rabies , not certain that his treatment would work . That 's pushing , wouldn 't you say ? Now , I 've given you all the time I have to spare . Edgar Scoville ... All I 'm asking is that you investigate your employees . My associates . Whatever . You 're poking around in the dark for something that isn 't there . Mrs. Fielding , these are next . I don 't want to instigate a witch hunt on the say-so of a deranged man . Do you mind if I ask a few questions ? Frankly , I do . Yes . But since Scoville 's an old friend of mine , he 's done me a few good turns , I ... Where do you want to start ? The dream machine . ( quiet humming ) Actually , it 's an electroencephalograph . We call it a dream machine because it records brain impulses and indicates when someone is dreaming . What do dreams have to do with sanity ? Forgive me for sounding rude , but I 'm a busy man , Mr. Vincent . Are all these questions really necessary ? I think so . The need to dream is so strong that when people are deprived of them , they will actually dream while awake . Hallucinate . If the person is continually deprived of dreaming , he becomes mentally deranged . That 's hard to believe . I assure you I am not making it up . How does it work ? The electrodes are attached to the scalp . The electrical impulses which the brain gives off are registered here . When a dream starts , a bell will automatically ring , which wakes the subject . At this point , he has total recall of the dream , which we record on tape for our records . Now , if you 'll excuse me , Mr. Vincent , I haven 't had any lunch . Well , you , uh , still haven 't explained why Julian Reed became psychotic . Before I left him for the night , I turned on the machine . Left him alone ? That 's the usual procedure . That way , nobody has to stay up all night . There 's a relay here . After five interruptions , this switch turns off the machine and allows uninterrupted dreaming for the rest of the night . Unfortunately , the relay failed . Unfortunately . Professor Reed had been without dreams for too long- - for over a week . He was nearing the point of breakdown . That 's why the machine was set for only five a night . What about this ? We also record pulse , respiration , heartbeat . ( rhythmic beeping ) Hmm . ( rhythmic beeping ) What the devil are you doing ? ( rhythmic beeping ) Thank you for your help . Then I didn 't take you away from any major discoveries . No , today was a very discouraging day . I discovered about as much as you did . You 're a celebrity , you know . The whole staff is taking bets as to whether you actually believe in planetary intruders or if it 's a magnificent put-on . I 'm used to that kind of stuff . Can 't make any sense out of it . I 've checked everything Julian 's told me . And found nothing because there 's nothing to find . I 'm going to see him tonight . Come with me . I can 't , David . Why not ? These are our friendly night watchmen . Ralph , Alfie , I 'd like for you to meet Mr. Vincent . So long , Mrs. Reed . Good night . ( dog barks ) ( both barking ) Pat , he wants to see his family . I don 't want Frankie to see his father like that . Not till he 's better . He is better . He 's calm , he 's rational , he 's fully aware of what happened . Anyway , you wouldn 't have to take Frankie . I know . You haven 't seen him since he 's been there . Think I don 't feel guilty about that ? I 'll go see him soon , David . I promise . I don 't understand . I want you to understand , David . I suppose I have seemed very cruel and ... and unfeeling . My grandfather ... was a wonderful old man . And I loved him dearly . When I was seven ... we were left alone . My parents had gone out . And all of a sudden , he just ... he just lost his mind . He just went berserk ! He just smashed everything in the house ... Before one of the neighbors could subdue him . That was the first time in my life I 'd ever felt ... terror , I suppose . I 've just never been able to forget it . Well , that 's all very unfortunate , but that 's a long time ago . First my grandfather and now Julian . I keep looking at Frankie . He seems so withdrawn ever since Julian is ... I just hope it 's my imagination . Pat , you know insanity is not hereditary . No , but the tendency is . You know , the weakness . David , Julian was always so strong , and I need him now . I need him the way he was . He needs you , too . I 'll tell you what , why don 't you sleep on it , huh ? And I 'll give him your love . No . No , I 'll give it to him . David , did Pat say when she ... ? Oh . I 'm sorry I didn 't come before , but I couldn 't . Aw , that 's all right . I understand . Hey . Hey , this is no kind of behavior for a scientist . How 's Frankie ? He 's fine . We 're both fine . Nobody 's bothered you ? No . How are you ? Oh , good appetite , pulse normal , ready to get back to the wars and a little homesick . David ... what about Brower ? You saw him ? Yeah . He 's , uh , kind of pompous , but , uh ... he 's just not an alien . I checked his heartbeat . Well , it 's some kind of trick . That-That 's wrong . There 's no question about it . Well , he 's an alien . He-He rigged the machine . Well , he explained that . He said , uh , the relay broke down on the machine . And you believed him ? Julian , please . DAVID : It was an accident . Please . I think you 're covering up for him because Jeff Brower is an alien . There were no signs . You don 't believe me , do you ? Neither of you do . The only one that does is Frankie . Frankie ... what ? He saw them , didn 't he tell you ? What 's the matter ? You 're one of them . I never saw that before . Saw what ? You 're one of them ! Julian ! Julian ! Julian ! You 're one of them ! He 's an alien ! Look at his hands ! He 's an alien ! Don 't you see him ? ! Go after him ! Don 't hold me ! He 's an alien ! You should be after him , not me ! Sorry you came all this way on a wild-goose chase . I 'm not . I had to find out . ( sighs ) And you won 't let me drive you to the airport ? No . I 'll catch a cab . Pat , if there 's anything I can do to help Julian ... I 'll call , of course . Will you and Frankie be all right ? Mmm . I 'm going to work very , very hard . Hmm ... kids bounce back . ( barking and snarling ) I don 't believe it . That 's how they die here . Doesn 't that prove something ? No . It just seems impossible . Julian wrote me before his illness and told me about the aliens and he was right- - they are here at Slaton . Now , he thought they were here because of the sophisticated projects that are going on here . Can you tell me anything about the projects ? Well , they , they cover a ... a pretty broad area- - some environmental systems , space medicine , nutrition . My own project is a theoretical propulsion engine . Electromagnetic ? How did you know that ? Some of the people I 've worked with think that 's the kind of engine they use to propel their spacecraft . Have you , uh , had any unusual problems with the project ? Any interference ? None . How about the other projects ? Well , we 've had a few projects scrapped . Some , we had high hopes for . It could be sabotage . David , that 's impossible . We send duplicate reports to Washington . They keep a record of everything . Do you send the reports yourself ? No , we give them to ... John Slaton . All the reports go through his office . Do you think there 's any possibility that , uh ... That he 's one of them ? Not a chance . I 've known him for years . What if he sold out ? I don 't believe it . He was more than cordial when I told him you were coming . Can you give me any more ? Only that if I were an alien , I 'd give priority to a propulsion system they 're working on here . It happens to be Pat Reed 's project . Agreed . I 'll put in a call to Washington . Thanks , Ed . Let me know . Frankie ? Frank ? Mind if I come in ? Frankie , last night , when I saw your dad ... he said you had seen something . What was it ? I don 't know what he meant . Something strange , spooky . I didn 't see anything , honest . Frankie , this is important . No , I didn 't . Really , I didn 't . All right , I believe you . Mr. Vincent ... he made me promise not to tell anyone . He won 't mind you telling me . I 'd been down on the pier , fishing , by the amusement park , and I saw a couple of kooky-looking guys go in there . Why was that strange ? Well , ' cause it 's all shut down for the winter . Anyway , I climbed the wall just to take a look , and there was a lot of funny-looking machinery . I told my dad and he started poking around there . And ... and the next thing I knew , he ... he , he was ... Hey , Frankie , Frankie ... It wasn 't your fault . I 'm afraid if they found I ... found out I know ... they 're going to do it to me , too . Don 't worry about that . Just don 't worry . Your mom will be home in a few minutes . Will you tell her I went to the amusement park ? Where is it ? West side of town . Okay . ( seagulls screeching in distance ) * * * * ( alarm sounding ) There 's somebody in the restricted area . Jensen , take over . * * * * * * ( bubbling ) It 's so strange . It doesn 't make scientific sense . It 's not strange , Pat . Turn a computer loose on it . It 's like an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite number of monkeys . BROWER : Do you really think you 'd get Hamlet ? What happened to you ? Where have you been ? The amusement park . Fall off the roller coaster ? David ... I don 't believe you know all these gentlemen . May I introduce to you Art Llewellan , this is Paul Meyers , and Jeff , I believe you know . David Vincent . Vincent . Aren 't you the fellow that ... ? I 'm the one . I thought so . We were just discussing going to other planets . Sit in . Tell us about your spacemen . I can do better than that . I can show you some . After all , if we can go to other planets , why can 't people from other planets come here ? We 're not saying there 's no such animal . We 're willing to acknowledge the possibility of life on other planets , but in the absence of proof , we rather doubt that that life is here right now . I can show you proof . David , you must be freezing . BROWER : Proof is to him as he sees it , which means that what may be proof to you is not necessarily proof to us . There 's alien machinery at the amusement park . Well , the , um , penny arcade or the Tunnel of Love ? You 're beginning to sound like Julian . What kind of machines ? I don 't know . LLEWELLAN : Describe them . I was jumped before I could see them . I only heard them . " Jumped " ? By whom ? Julian 's psychosis must be contagious . Do you have feelings of persecution , Mr. Vincent ? Can 't you stop playing psychologist for a moment ? I 'm not being paranoid . Gentlemen , the meeting is over . Good night . All I ask is that one of you come with me . I thought scientists explored every possibility . But on a cold night , we also weigh the probabilities . Good night , Mr. Vincent . Good night , Pat . See you tomorrow . LLEWELLAN : Good night . PAT : Good night . ( door closes ) I saw them , too , and so did Dad . You march on out of here , mister , and go to bed . I told Mr. Vincent that ... Move ! You 're turning your back on this whole thing . ( door closes ) Now , look , I won 't have you involving my son in your fantasies . But it 's true . He saw something . Will you listen to me for a minute ? No , I won 't listen to you ! I am sick to death of hearing about aliens and being reminded that my-my husband has had a nervous breakdown , and now you 're trying to involve my son . I-I like you , David , but I think it would be better if you found another place to stay . Pat ... No . It-it would be best . Really . I don 't like the idea of you and Frankie being alone . Will you stop it , David ? ! Sorry . You 're sorry ; I 'm sorry ; the whole world is sorry . I 've just had too much happen to me in too short a time . I know . No , you don 't know . You think you do , but you don 't . I need Julian , David . I am so weak without him . David . I just had a long session with Washington . They reached a decision yesterday on Pat Reed 's project . They 're going to cancel . Did they give any reason ? Faulty chain of reasoning- - something pretty esoteric , but they feel they 're no further along than they were six months ago . After what happened to Julian and now this . Pat 's going to be crushed . I know . It 's a darn shame . She 'll probably get official notification sometime tomorrow . Listen , is it possible that someone could have changed those reports before the government people saw them ? It 's possible . I 'll try to get hold of a copy . Can you break away from the plant ? Good . Yeah , I 'll be staying at the Rancho Motel . Okay , fine . Bye . Pat . What reports ? ( sighs ) Yours . That was Edgar Scoville . I 'm afraid the reaction in Washington was rather negative . That 's not possible , David . We 've made a real breakthrough . It is possible that someone tampered with those reports before they got to Washington . Oh , I don 't believe that , David . For your sake , I hope we 're wrong . ( car horn honking ) That must be my cab . ( sighs ) You call me if you need me , will you ? Yes , I will . ( rhythmic beeping ) ( rhythmic beeping ) You don 't believe me . Nobody believes me . Julian , stop it ! You 're one of them ! Stop it , Julian ! That 's what you are . You 're one of them . You 're an alien ! DAVID : Yes . Look at his hands ! He 's an alien ! DAVID : Yes . Julian , stop this ! He 's an alien ! Why don 't you go after him ? He 's an alien ! Go after him ! He 's an alien ! He 's an alien ! He 's an alien . Don 't you realize that ? ! He 's an alien ! ( bell ringing ) ( ringing stop , rhythmic beeping ) What 's proof to you , Vincent , may not be proof to us . Alien machinery at the amusement park . Where , in the Tunnel of Love ? You sound just like Julian . What kind of machines ? DAVID : I 'm not sure . Then how do you know they 're alien machines ? I heard the sound . I was jumped . By whom ? ( men chuckling ) I don 't know . You sound just like Julian . What kind of machines ? ( men laughing ) DAVID : I don 't know . ( laughter ) I don 't know ! ( laughter ) I don 't know . I don 't know . I don 't know . I don 't know ! I don 't know . I don 't know . I don 't know ! ( rhythmic beeping ) And that 's all they said- - canceled . I can 't understand it , either . I 'm sorry , Pat- - really sorry . ( sighs ) But you read the reports , John . They were good reports . They were better than good . They staked out a whole new direction for us , a whole new way of investigation . If this were the first time , I 'd charge it up to Washington red tape or bureaucracy or lack of funds . Well , at least it doesn 't come as a surprise . What do you mean ? David told me last night . David Vincent . He talked to Scoville . Scoville had talked to Washington . It was so incredible that I could hardly make myself believe it . Let me check this through . In the meantime , you go out and buy yourself an expensive lunch . You 'll feel better . Thank you , John . ( bell ringing ) ( rhythmic beeping ) ( bell ringing ) ( bell ringing ) ( rhythmic beeping ) He 's already here ? Don 't worry . I 'll take care of my end . Yes , he said the Rancho Motel . He never registered . Has a Mister ... a Mr. Scoville come by ? Yes , I know where that is . Well , if you see either one of them , will you have them call Pat Reed , please ? Yes , thank you . Oh ! Jeff . Thank God you 're here . What 's wrong , Pat ? Oh , just everything . It 's just like some crazy nightmare . Julian ill and David disappeared and my project canceled . It just ... Take it easy . There are answers for these things . Vincent will show up . But what about my project ? Why was it canceled , like he said it would be ? I know it 's a blow , but back off for a day . Give Slaton a chance to follow through . No . It was going too well . I 've got my research notes , and I 'm going to get them to Washington now . Good idea . If I can help ... No , Jeff , you 're very dear to offer , but I 've got to ask someone who can take them straight to the top . Dr. Slaton ? No . David has a friend- - a man by the name of Mr. Scoville . He said he 'd be at the motel but no one 's seen him . He 'll turn up , Edgar . Chances are he 's off looking for aliens someplace . Don 't put him down , John . I 'm not putting him down . It 's just that , well , he 's created quite a stir among some of our people . Let me tell you something . These aliens you 're scoffing at are possibly responsible for some of your projects being canceled . Edgar , a week ago , if anybody tried to talk to me seriously about invaders from outer space , I 'd have tossed them out on their ear , but today ... Today I 'll buy any explanation of what 's going on , rational or otherwise . That magnetic propulsion engine is one of our key projects . Pat Reed has the most extraordinary facility for blending science and imagination . I 've read all the reports . They 're excellent . Then why did they cancel ? I don 't know . Edgar , what 's it all about ? Here 's a copy of your report , the way it arrived in Washington . I suggest you read it . ( phone rings ) Dr. Slaton 's office . This is Pat Reed . Uh , has an Edgar Scoville been there ? No , Dr. Reed . No one 's been by here since lunch . Oh . Well , if he comes in , or if you see David Vincent , would you have them call me in my lab ? It is terribly important . Of course . Edgar , these aren 't the reports I read . They 're the ones that went to the government . Who had them after you ? Nobody . They were typed up fresh and sent in . Who typed them ? Mrs. Fielding , my ... secretary . Empty . Half our records are gone . Including Pat Reed 's report . Well , is there another copy ? She 'll have her research notes . That 'll be good enough . ( phone rings ) Hello . Sorry , she 's not back from lunch yet . Sure . Glad to . Who was that ? Somebody for your assistant . Sounded like a boyfriend . Oh . Scoville left word at the motel that he 'd be at Slaton 's office . I 'm going over there and wait . If anybody can get these reports to Washington , it 's him . Like me to come with you ? I 'd appreciate that very much . Hold it ! Oh , n-never mind . You go right ahead . I-I forgot something . What 's the matter ? That man- - his hand . Didn 't you see it ? David says some of the aliens have hands like that with a mutated finger . Pat ... I 'm sorry , Jeff , I 'm afraid to go up there . Tell you what . Come over to my lab . You 'll be safe there . I promise you I 'll find Scoville . Okay . There 's not a sign of them . Where the devil can Pat be ? I 'm John Slaton . Oh , yes , sir , I know . This is important . When Professor Reed gets back from lunch have her contact me immediately . Have you got it ? Yes , sir , but , uh , well , Mrs. Reed got back from lunch almost an hour ago . She got back ? Oh , yes , sir . She just left the building with Mr. Brower , just a couple of minutes ago . Brower ? Yes , that 's Julian Reed 's assistant . Brower ? That could have been ... That was Brower on the phone . You 'd better come with us . ( rhythmic beeping ) I think I 'll call the motel again . ( bell ringing ) ( ringing continues ) David . What ? ! What are you ... ? ! Jeff ! Jeff ... You can 't be one of them . The heartbeat . Figure it out . You 're a scientist . A mechanical heart . A pacemaker . ( knocking on door ) It 's Fielding . ( screaming ) ( screaming continues ) Get the car . Take care of him . Break it open . ( gunshot ) David ! ( gunshot ) David , are you all right ? This is what they did to Julian . Feeling better ? Yeah . Another couple of minutes ... Thank you , Edgar . Sorry , Pat- - checkmate . ( chuckling ) Can 't win ' em all . I have a plane to catch . Take care of yourself , huh ? Mr. Slaton 's anxious to put you back to work . Thanks for everything , David . I 'll see you to the door . Okay . Have I told you lately how much I appreciate you ? No , not for a half hour . Don 't worry . He 's going to be all right . He 's responding to treatment . If you hadn 't come , I wonder how all this would have turned out . Oh , come on . Good-bye . Bye-bye . NARRATOR : Perhaps it has ended for the Reed family , but for David Vincent it is still the beginning .

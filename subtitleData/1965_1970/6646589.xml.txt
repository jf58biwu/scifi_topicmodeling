It 's ... it 's jammed . Uh , what happened ? Everything is jammed ! [ Branches rustling ] [ Door opening ] One of the main reasons for this refresher course Is to keep you up to date on the latest methods and weapons . This little gadget here dissolves metal electronically . Easy to conceal , extremely effective in times of danger . That 's when the danger usually starts . I like my way better . Now if you ladies will follow me over here . * [ Everybody loves somebody by Dean Martin playing ] * everybody falls in love somehow * Lucky Linda ! Yes , imagine , working on a field problem with him . * my sometime * is now [ Gadget bursts ] [ Sighing ] How do you like that ? I didn 't even get to squeeze the trigger . Oh , when you say you 're a 38 , you ain 't just kidding . It 's not a gun , Mr. helm . It 's a new weapon they gave me , Developed right here in our lab . And developed pretty well , too . Here , I 'll show you . If you 'll turn around . Are you aiming or just being modest ? I 'm sorry I tricked you , Mr. helm , but may I point out ... You already did . That that 's why you 're here : To become familiar with our latest equipment . You 're right . An agent should always keep abreast of the times . You see , it 's sewn right into the stays . A retractable gun barrel . Fires on contact . Hmm . Hey , that 's some kind of crazy holster . Well , I guess the lesson 's over with for today . Now , where were we ? Oh no , you don 't . Those things come in pairs . That 's him . Really ? ( Girl # 1 ) Matt helm . Don 't shoot . [ Sheila screaming ] Help me ! Help ! Whoa , honey . He 's trying to kill me . It 's all right , Sheila . Sheila ? Please . Sheila sommers ? ( Man ) Do you know her ? Yeah , we worked an assignment together . Don 't you remember me , Matt helm ? ( Man ) Come along , Sheila . Everything 's all right . Come along . Attagirl . She thinks every man is trying to kill her . When I knew her , she 'd kill them right back . What 's the story ? That 's what we 'd like to know . She stumbled out of the jungle a few weeks ago . Beat up pretty bad . In deep shock . Can 't remember anything . She 's going to be here a long time . [ Scooter horn honking ] Long-distance call for you , Mr. helm . Hop aboard . I go pretty fast . Better find something to hang on to . Crazy . ( Matt ) When am I getting out of here ? You 're not . Come on , Mac . I don 't need a refresher course . Every girl here is built like the aberdeen proving grounds . You 're not there for a refresher course . Not anymore . Matt , do you remember a girl named Sheila sommers ? Yeah , I just bumped into , well , what 's left of her . What about her ? I don 't want to discuss it now . Your secretary 's on the way . You 'll find out a few things from her . You told lovey ? ( Mac ) Well , no , not exactly . But , heh , you 'll get the message . Mr. helm , it 's time for your fencing lesson . Hmm ? Fine , now it 's the guns of navarone . [ Speaking French ] Where are you from , bridgeport or someplace ? I 'm from Paris . And we French are using more and more girls in our work . It opens up a whole new area . Yeah . Tres bien , monsieur . En garde . Right , then maybe later on we 'll do a little fencing , too , huh ? How are you feeling underneath there ? Just fine . You just look lovely . Gil , we have Sheila sommers here . You said you 'd give her an appointment . Sommers ? Sommers . Yes , of course . You 're lucky we can squeeze you in today . She looks like she was squeezed in Long before she ever got here . We want her to feel like a beautiful young woman again . Have you tried prayer ? We 've tried everything . ( Guard ) Oh , that 's Matt helm 's secretary . What 's her name ? Lovey kravezit . Lovey kravezit ? What would you call her ? Ok , miss kravezit , you 're cleared . Thank you . ( Both ) And thank you . Would you like powder or cream ? Surprise me . I 'm just a masseuse . You surprised me . Relax , you 're all tensed up . Mr. helm , I just this second got here . Oh , am I interrupting anything ? No , she 's just a masseuse . I think I 've got everything you want . Yeah . I brought your electric toothbrush , And I even brought your mouthwash . Oh , only 36 % more cavities . But you don 't care . Will there be anything else ? No . Yes . I 'll meet you in the steam room . Relax , you 're all tensed up . [ Slapping ] Well ? Here ? We 're alone . I guess it ... i guess it 's kind of romantic . Haven 't you got a message for me ? You always said I did . From MacDonald . Oh , no . No message ? Are you sure ? Well , there are messages and there are messages . That 's the way everything 's been going around here . Haven 't they taken good care of you ? There 's taking care and there 's taking care . There must be something , I mean , Some little something that I can do for you . Oh , poor Mr. helm . ( Mac ) Ok , Matt , hold it right there . I knew you 'd get to it . What is this ? Candid brassiere ? ( Mac ) Now listen . I 'm all ears . ( Mac ) Stop whatever you 're doing . I can 't hear a thing . ( Mac ) Sheila sommers holds the key To the most serious crisis our country has ever faced . Get close to her , Matt . That 's your assignment . I want you on top of this from morning to night . I beg your pardon . ( Mac ) And furthermore , Matt , Don 't let anybody there know what you 're up ... Hmm , so much for his message . Now , about your message . Who 's Sheila sommers ? Hmm , that 's what I say . ( Nurse ) Mr. helm , it 's time for your physical . ( Matt ) I 'm way ahead of you . ( Announcer ) Your attention , please . As part of your final examination , Here is today 's problem . Imagine that you are a group of strangers Sharing a compartment on a European train . One of you is supposed to be a secret agent Carrying a coded message for a foreign power . The assignment is to uncover that secret agent And obtain the coded message . The lights will be extinguished from time to time To simulate passage through several tunnels . Good luck . [ Chewing loudly ] The man said to uncover the secret agent . ( Announcer ) Attention , please . This concludes today 's exercise . Please report to your officer in charge For further instruction . Thank you . Now we stop playing games , Mr. helm . Oh , no , not again . This is not an experimental exercise , Mr. helm . This is a real gun with real bullets . The only things loaded around here are the girls . What are your orders regarding The missing experimental craft ? The what ? The so-called flying disc your scientists have developed . Oh , my lips are sealed . I will never divulge that information . Pretty good , huh ? Can I go ? Mr. helm , if you don 't answer the question , I 'll kill you . That 's what I call really flunking . [ Gun firing ] Now you know why you 're here . To get killed . Matt , have you ever seen a flying saucer ? Is that your way of offering me a drink ? We built one . The first earth-built vehicle to use electromagnetic force . You 're putting me on . Somebody kidnapped it . I don 't blame them . And Sheila sommers took it up and ... Wait a minute , wait a minute you put a girl in that thing ? And for a damn good reason . You had a boy pilot , too ? Sheila sommers is the best pilot that i.C.E. Ever had . But that 's not the main reason . Ah , what 's the difference why ? She came back without it . What happened ? That 's what you 're here to find out . She can 't remember . We think you can help her to remember . Me ? Sure . You and Sheila worked an assignment together once , remember ? As man and wife . Yeah , newlyweds . We were supposed to be on our honeymoon . What I don 't do for my country . She won 't let a man come near her . But that 's never stopped you before . And maybe you can find out what we can 't . But there 's one thing I would like to find out . There 's only one way he could have gotten in here . Now , somebody on our side isn 't . No . No . Just something to quiet you . To help you to sleep . Help ! It 's locked . Help ! Help ! They 've heard you do that before , and it won 't ... Help ! Just put you to sleep . No ! Help , help ! Hello , Mac , what are you doing here ? How do you do , doctor ? I assume you 've met my husband . [ Projector whirring ] [ Crowd chattering ] [ Crowd cheering ] ( Referee ) 1 , 2 ... It 's a good fight . 3 ... [ Boxing soundtrack cuts out ] Here it comes . * [ Mariachi music playing ] * when the chili pot is nice and hot then drink some montezuma * * it will dance senor on to the floor and shake senora 's bloomer * * she 'll call you a sport , drink pint , drink quart * * it will warm your solar plexus * * be a real big man , look for the can that got the double " x 's " * * when the chili pot is nice and hot then drink some montezuma * That 's it ? Yeah . We did some digging around . That 's a pretty popular jingle down in Mexico . That won 't do us any good . Sheila could have heard it anytime . Maybe not . See how you like it in this tempo . * [ Music playing ] The marching song of a secret organization . A bunch of fanatics from all over Europe . Their leader was a man named caselius . We thought they 'd gone out of business . Now they 're selling beer . Who is this Mr. montezuma ? He 's a millionaire named quintana . Lives in acapulco . His real name is chibnik . Ole ! As far as we know He hasn 't been doing any fooling around down there , you know , except with beer . No fooling around ? You don 't tell me these 2 dames Were picked for their singing . Matt , how would you like to take Mr. quintana 's picture ? You know , do a big spread on him and the brewery For a top magazine . I don 't know . Is the beer any good ? We 've already set it up . There are 2 tickets on the 11 : 00 plane for acapulco . 2 tickets ? Sheila 's going with you . No chance . Matt , she thinks you 're her husband . As long as she 's with you , she 's all right . And she can help . Help ? The last thing I need is a dame around me who thinks she 's my wife . You know how I operate . Matt , somewhere there 's a man who treated that girl like an animal . Some way , she 's going to see him again . And when she does We 'll know who 's got what we want And how we can get it back . I 'm not going to do it . Yes , you are going to do it . There 's no other way . Because wherever that saucer is , The only one who can fly it out of there is Sheila . Do you want to know why ? Before setting up this last flight , They ran a series of lab tests on a variety of animals . They all came out the same . The females lived , the males died . What were they doing ? Matt , don 't you understand ? An electromagnetic field has a very strange effect on the male of the species : It kills them , dead . I now pronounce me man and wife . A second honeymoon in acapulco . How did you ever arrange it ? Oh , wasn 't easy . I just told Mac right straight out . I said I wanted to do this magazine job in Mexico . And now , no assignment for i.C.E. Till we get back . Is the magazine the only reason ? Not exactly . I can 't wait to get you South of the border . Mmm . Hmm . [ Matt exclaiming ] [ Tires screeching ] Ole ! Why don 't you go unpack and freshen up a bit , huh ? While I check the exposure on this camera . Huh ? Buenos dias , senorita . Buenas tardes , senor . Oh , si , si ... Si , si ... A-ha . Oh , manager . That sweet thing down there , what 's her name ? Senor , stay away from that one . You don 't want to have nothing to do with her . Why not ? Who is she ? My wife . Buenos dias , senor . You , why , you miserable ... I have an appointment . My name is helm . Senor helm ? Matt helm ? Oh . Senor quintana 's expecting you . I have a collection of all of your photographs . Oh , you 're fantastic . You seem to make a girl look so ... so beautiful So ... so exciting , so ... so ... Would you like to pose for me ? Oh , no . [ Men laughing ] Ah . Who 's gonna want a beer with a head on it ? Ah , Mr. helm , at last . We also have a brand called " 3 ' x 's . " 3 ? Oh , that I gotta see . My assistant , Mrs. helm . Delighted . Hello . That 's a crazy 6-pack . It 's quite an occasion . We 're rolling our millionth barrel of beer today . Well , you 're my kind of guy . We 're all going to celebrate . I 'm giving a large party this afternoon . You 're both invited , of course . I 'll have my car pick you up . Oh , thank you . Allow me to show you around . I know your work , Mr. helm . All those beautiful girls you photograph , mmm ... Makes you want to ... Oh , I do . I did , I did ! ( Quintana ) Now then , these vats is where the grain boils At extraordinary temperatures . All the grain vats . This is our light beer . Care for a taste ? Oh , I never touch the stuff , except when I 'm working . I always say , montezuma is good for what ails you . Get it ? Oh , I got it . It 's clever . I often make humorous remarks . You latins are a fun-loving people . Here 's another one , an xxx . I 'll try that . Mmm . Just like mother used to drink . Mmm-hmm . Matt , look . Yeah , Sheila ? Hey , what do you put in this beer ? Fantastic , isn 't it ? It gives an average man the strength of a giant . He can handle a 1,500-pound load . I know the feeling . It 's controlled by hydro-mechanical servo valves . Yeah . I wonder what that tastes like . Here 's a new one . Matt , darling , we do want to take in all the brewery . I 'm doing the best I can . * [ Music playing ] These young ladies help promote my beer all over the world . Hmm , they sure lift the steins for dear old montezuma . The fashions are fabulous . The famous creations of cassini . Ole ! Oleg . I never could speak that language . You might want to include them in your layout . Oh , no , I 'm a married man . Oh , uh , enjoy yourselves . Excuse me . You sure you 've never met him before ? Of course not . I don 't know . He ... he looked at you awful familiar . Hmm , that 's more than you do . You 're not acting very much like a bridegroom . I 'll take care of that later . [ Helicopter approaching ] [ Glass shattering ] [ People chattering ] His name is Jose Ortega . They say he 's a very interesting man . What 's he do ? What does any interesting man do ? Uh , look for it at your newsstand . Oh , just a minute . No " unidentified blonde " business . My name is francesca madeiros . Madeiros . Is that Greek ? Where are you from ? The bar . The bar ? I 've got relatives there . No , I 'm really from the hotel del Cortez . Cottage f . Oh , it must be beautiful there this time of the year . Ah , you should see it . Uh-huh , that 's what I like . A girl with spirit . You going to put me in your magazine ? Right between the covers . We 're here , if you need us . I got the wife with me . En garde , mon Cher . Touche . As an added feature , this outfit has been given a belt . Hmm , I could use a belt myself . Somebody knows , I tell you ! I 'm more interested in the girl . Are you certain she 's the one ? Not completely . That 's why I wanted you to see her . Looks are sometimes deceiving . What about the husband ? His name is helm , a very well-known photographer in America . He specializes in girls . He could be just another one . I 'll soon find out . Senor helm , may I have that film , please ? Beg your pardon ? Uh , senor Ortega does not like his picture taken . A small quirk . It 's the scar , I think . I 'm sure you understand . No offence . Uh , thank you , senor . [ Beeping ] [ Electronic droning ] [ Droning stops ] Ahem . Send this message to Matt . Is this what you 're looking for ? For everything you did to me . * [ Music playing ] Hey , baby . Matt , can we leave now ? Ah , you honeymooners . Heh , heh . There 's work to be done . He 's right , honey . The party 's just beginning to swing . Have a drink . Dance a while . Later on , we can have our interview . Hmm . Hi . A little . Who 's your friend ? She invited me to her homeland , the hotel del Cortez . When you honeymoon . The more , the merrier . Ok , baby . I don 't think I 'm going to like this next number . ( Francesca ) Hey ! Where 's the funeral ? Come on , get with it . Make them play . Let 's go-go ! Oh , come on ! Quintana , they won 't play . That 's it . Come on , everybody , let 's see what 's going on . Everybody drink . Everybody dance . What ? Everybody swim . Get back to the hotel and wait for me . Aren 't you coming ? No , I don 't want to miss the action . Sometimes these things turn into brawls . I don 't want you here . Now get going . [ Car engine revving ] Matt . You 'll tell me later . Now get going . Come on . [ Helicopter whirring ] Damn it . [ Whistling ] * [ Band music playing ] [ Helicopter approaching ] Turn right on the next road . I 've got orders to kill you , baby . But maybe if you 're nice to me , I 'll let you live a little longer . [ Tearing ] [ Gun firing ] [ Crickets chirping ] [ Doorbell ringing ] You don 't waste any time , do you ? I just got here . Oh , looks like you started without me . Home is everything you said it was : Loaded with points of interest . What 's on your mind ? I thought we 'd enjoy the late show together . I don 't have a television set . All the better . I certainly enjoyed your little dance tonight . Oh , you should have stayed . It got better . I got carried away . That 's why I left . I ... i didn 't want to be . Why did quintana want to kill you ? Maybe he didn 't like his proofs . What is it he knows about you , baby , huh ? Could be what I know about him . I 'd hoped you 'd say that . What ? His real name is chibnik . Everyone knows that . Now , look , darling . Darling , I did something for you , you do something for me . With pleasure . No , no , that 's not it . Maybe later . Right now , though ... Right now , what ? Where can I find a man named caselius ? The last time I saw him , he was in a helicopter . Ortega ? Everyone knows that . Don 't you ? You said he was a rather interesting man . Where are his headquarters ? You tell me . It 's going to be like that , is it ? Don 't you know ? If I did , you wouldn 't be here . I get it . That explains the psychological warfare in the elevator . The old Alma mater , the double " x " beer march . That was to break quintana down so he could run to caselius And you could follow him , huh ? Why ? Would you care for a drink ? No , I 'm not too fond of that there chloral hydrate . Suit yourself . All right , so much for that . Now , It is later . [ Grunting ] That wasn 't nice . You can 't blame a girl for trying . You knew he was in there , didn 't you ? Hmm , I could hear his hot breath every time you moved . Ah , I have that effect on some people . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . You drugged me . Just in case . How did you do that ? Oh , do you like my lipstick , darling ? It 's a special brand . There 's a chemical that penetrates the skin . How about your skin ? I just drank the antidote . Ah , that 's right , baby . Get angry , get angry . That increases the heart beat and speeds up the drug . Speed it up all the way . Where is caselius ? Where is caselius ? Caselius , I don 't ... i don 't know , oh . The girl , what ? What girl ? Francesca . Francesca . What about her ? Beautiful , beautiful . Oh . What a broad ... I 'd like to ... She likes you , too , baby . She likes you a lot . Hmm . You want to make it with her ? Oh . You just tell her what she wants to hear . Beautiful . That is not bad , but you can do even better . She 's built like a ... That 's not what she wants to hear . Tell her where is caselius . I 'll kill him . I 'll kill him . I want to kill him , too , but I have to find him first . So tell me where he is . Guadalajara ? Tecate ? Mexico city ? Am I getting warm ? Oh , very warm . Very warm . Hold it right there . Where ? Get him out of it , fast . I can bring him to , if that 's what you mean . That 's what I mean . ( Matt ) Francesca . Francesca , phew . What a girl . How 'd you find me ? I remembered about her homeland . To think some guys complain about jealous wives . Were you watching for a long time ? A long time . Did I have fun ? Wow . That 's " wow " ? Oh , I do vaguely remember one thing . Yes ? I seem to recall you saying something About getting rid of caselius yourself . True ? Why ? A certain country is undergoing some political unrest Thanks to Mr. caselius . My orders are simple : To put the country to rest , put caselius to rest . Now , who are you ? Well , let 's say we 're both after the same man . Yeah . Tough enough to get him without fighting each other . Unless , of course , we work together . Partners ? ( Francesca ) Partners . Once we know where caselius is I have some forged papers that will get us in to him . We 'll all take turns watching quintana . The first watch will be in the morning . And chuckles can handle that one . You don 't trust her , do you ? I don 't trust any woman . You can drop the act now . Come on . I was going to , anyway . I checked us out of the motel . By now quintana 's men must be in the beds , Under the beds , and in the closets . When did you snap out of it ? You know that day on the funny farm , When that nurse tried to kill me ? When you walked in that door , everything came back . You sure fooled a lot of people . That was the idea , Dr. Watson . You know how Mac 's mind works . Never in a straight line . I had to convince him that I was 100 % normal only if I were with you . Then he 'd have to send me back , and I had to come back . Why ? To kill caselius . I tried tonight , with blanks . That 's the lousy kind of agent I am . Um , oh , no . You played your own hand . For you , not us . You jumped a gun . Took a chance of blowing the whole deal . That 's the kind of a lousy agent you are . Now that I 've said that , and knowing what I do about caselius , Too bad you missed . [ Telephone buzzing ] Don 't answer it . It 's quintana Trying to find out how dead I am . What do you mean ? The next time you send me off by myself , look in the back seat . Where are we going ? What are we stopping here for ? Ah , quintana 's a big man . Every motel in acapulco has our description by now . We 'll spend the night at the outdoor Hilton . Baby , it 's cold outside . Maybe he 's got some blankets in the trunk . Ah , there we are . I wonder what that is . [ Inflating ] Look out . Instant motel . [ Inflating ] Come on , step right in . Are you ready for this ? Well , now that we 're no longer man and wife , I 'll sleep on the other side . If that bed tilts up and I fall in the pool , I 'm leaving . Matt . Yeah . Do you have a plan ? Yeah . What is it ? Oh , I 'm going to say it 's getting a little chilly and I think that We should cuddle up together for warmth . Good plan . It might work . Hmm . Now that I am the old Sheila . You can depend on me . I won 't disappoint you . You didn 't . ( Matt ) I love my wife , but , oh , you , Sheila . [ Speaking in Mexican accent ] Senor , I think a double-cross . Um , I 'm going in . You stay here . Matt , I 'm scared . All right , I 'll stay here . You go in . [ Gun firing ] Now I know we 're partners . We 're trying to kill each other . Ah , saved . Help ! Help ! I 'm drowning . I 'm drowning . I can 't swim . Drink yourself to the bottom . That madman , Karl , he pushed me in here . And you told him where to find caselius ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Ok . [ Gagging ] Please . ( Quintana ) Uh , ugh . [ Quintana gasping ] Help me . What 's happening ? The settling vats , part of the fermentation process . There are iron rollers . We 'll be killed . Why ? It doesn 't hurt the beer . Don 't let me go . Come on . Where 's caselius , eh ? I don 't know . I don 't know . [ Exclaiming ] Caselius . He 's in the jungle . Where ? Copala valley . Help me ! Uh . Ah . [ Loud crashing ] You can still make a spare . A little on the Brooklyn side . Oh . [ Grunting ] [ Groaning ] [ Grunting ] [ Groaning ] Ole . Copala valley is about 100 Miles from here , according to this map And a torture test all the way . Good . Good . Good . Good . Good . Good . [ Engine revving ] I just hope that ape-man was able to contact the lady And tell her where to find caselius . You hope what ? Oh , we can use her . She has documents that can get her into caselius ' hideout . You can 't trust her . Maybe not , but her gorilla tried to kill quintana . So she 's not on their side , either . We 'll never catch her . She 's got too much of a head start . We 'll catch her . You know , when I called her up this morning ... Just to touch base ... She asked how the roads were around here And if she needed a jeep or something . I said the roads were all good And that her car would do just fine . So just about now She should be calling me all kinds of a dirty ... No-good lying rat . [ Clanging ] Well , howdy , pardner . Funny place for a pit stop . Well , if it isn 't the man from the auto club . You were right , mister . I didn 't need a jeep . I needed a tank . I 've been called that before , too . Now why don 't you hop in ? I 'll give you a lift . Why ? Because you 're a fun girl . Yeah . You 're back on the team . Partners again ? I 'm surprised you trust me . Well , you need us as much as we need you , And you 've got the papers to get in there . That 's right . So why do I need you ? To get out . Now get in . This must be the place . Ok , big John , what 's the caper ? Yeah , remember those pictures ? C 'mon , let 's stash these in the bushes , eh ? You 're taking over , you know . You get to caselius , show him your papers . Maybe he 'll go for it , maybe he won 't . But tell him somebody 's following you . I want him to be ready for me . Ready for you ? Mmm , I want to walk right into his hands . But , Matt . That 'll prove you 're really one of them . And once he 's sure that he can trust you , he 'll relax . And the way I figure , he likes to relax . Here , turn around . Ah . That 'll help . Would you like me to leave ? Muss your hair up , smear some dirt on your face . And then what ? We 'll play it by ear . Huh , it 's the last place I would have suspected . I 've taken a lot from you , little girl . Maybe we shouldn 't see each other anymore . Oh . That 's the spirit . That 's fine . Good . Here . Oh , that 's heavy . What is it ? A new kind of weapon ? Just put it in your purse . Chances are they won 't search you . How do I use it ? You don 't . That 's my department . You 'd better get started . How do I find our friend ? Just drive towards those mountains . He 'll find you . And good luck , baby . You can do it . Oh , she will . What about a good-luck kiss ? Why not ? I 'm superstitious , myself . Don 't say it . You may hate her guts , but she 's a pro . Whatever she 's pro , I 'm anti . Come on , auntie . What is it ? I thought I heard something . A taxi . Taxi . Hmm . She ought to be there by now . Ah , yeah . There 's the jeep . I don 't see the saucer . Patience , auntie . Patience . Yeah . If there 's something hidden down there , we 'll get a shot of it . What 's that ? It 's a heat camera , infrared . [ Camera humming ] Well , look what 's going on in the woods . There 's a hell of a big truck , there 's some motorcycles And there 's baby . The man-killer . Of course , they wouldn 't keep it out in the open . That must what the tracks are for , To bring it to the launch site when it 's ready . Listen , I 'm going in at dawn . You give me a few minutes , then head towards the saucer . 'Cause I gotta find that controlling device and put it out of action . Now when caselius hits the fan , there 's gonna be a lot of gunfire . The minute you hear it , you fly . I fly , what do you do ? I 'll find something . We have a long wait ahead of us , so let 's get comfortable . Hmm ? How comfortable ? It 's broad daylight . What 's the matter with a broad in daylight ? Hmm . Suspenders and a belt ? Yeah , I have trouble keeping my pants up . Special brand . Contains a magic ingredient : happy gas . It makes you rather switch than fight . Here we go . Matt . Um . Oh , don 't tell me you 're going to say " be careful " ? I wouldn 't dream of it . Be careful . [ Gun loading ] Ah , Mr. helm , I 've been expecting you . Nothing like roughing it . Oh , it can get rough , Mr. helm . Very rough , indeed . Hey , you left something . [ Buzzer ] [ Clicking ] [ Clicking ] Show them in . Gen. Caselius , may you walk in prosperity . ( Nassim ) The girl is helm 's partner . ( Nassim ) I found her nearby with this gun . She has a great love for firearms . We 're old friends , aren 't we , my dear ? I owe you a debt of gratitude , senor . Nassim . Nassim . A letter of introduction from my organization . As you can see , I 'm empowered to offer you a large sum For a certain aircraft in your possession . How did you find me ? The light of the gracious moon illumined my path . Also , I followed Mr. helm . May a thousand tigers break every bone in your body . It is a very generous offer . Mexican cigarettes , Mr. helm ? I couldn 't find my own brand .

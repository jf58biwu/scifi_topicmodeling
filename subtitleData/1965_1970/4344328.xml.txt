 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . [ Groans ] - What 's the matter ? - My ankle - I think it 's broken . Maybe you just pulled a tendon . - You think you could walk on it ? - I don 't know . - [ Chattering ] - [ Hammering ] You wait here . I 'll take a look . Japanese . We must be somewhere in the South Pacific - World War II . There 's no doubt about it . Look . - [ Cannons Firing ] - Down ! We 're right in line with their target . Let 's move . - You go on . I 'll catch up . - Nothing doing . Just lean on me . I 'll help you . - [ Explosions ] - [ Shell Incoming ] I can 't make it . Go on . Get out of here . They 're laying them in on top of us . Are you kidding ? Come on ! [ Explosions ] You stay here . I 'll check it out . Watch it . It may be booby-trapped . [ Clattering ] [ Gunshot ] Get up . ! I said , " Get up . ! ' " I 'm not gonna kill you . ! You speak English ? Sukoshi . Uh , yeah . Some . Yes . - Are you alone here ? - Only myself . Yes . Do you have food and medical supplies ? His leg hurt bad . Broken maybe ? - We don 't know yet . - One time I help sick soldier . Maybe I help him . Yes ? Let 's get inside . It is not broken . Bad sprain , maybe . You wish I tape ? All right . Hold it ! My tape . Go ahead . I can 't understand why the soldiers in the main compound ... aren 't swarming all over us . - They must 've heard those shots . - They are gone now . There is ship in the harbor , ne ? How come they pulled out and left you behind ? I 'm a spotter . It is my duty to see ship moving ... and report them . Is this tape too binding ? No . I say we get on the radio . Let the battlewagons know we 're here . They can send a shore party to pick us up . - Know how to operate a Japanese radio ? - I think so . Don 't move , Joe , or you 'll get a hole through you . You either . Stay put . Now move ! You bluff too easily , Joe . But then , I never saw an American who didn 't . Too much imagination - That 's your trouble . [ Laughs ] Captured by a stick of wood . You can 't explain that to your superiors , can you , Joe ? But you Joes are lucky . You won 't have to explain anything to anybody . And imagination is good . I like that . We 're going to have some interesting times together ... before I kill you . The Time Tunnel . You got any cigarettes , Joe ? - No . - What 's a-matter you , Joe ? Yankees are always supposed to have cigarettes . Chocolate bars for kids . Cigarettes for adult . That 's right , isn 't it ? [ Speaking Japanese ] We can 't leave them there with that sadist . Have you found out where they are yet ? There about 7 00 miles southeast ofTokyo , but that area 's full of islands . - It could be any one of 20 . - What 's the date ? Early in 1 945 . One of the first three months , I 'd say . Switch back to the American fleet . I think I can recognize two of them . - Yes . That 's the Missouri , and there 's the Illinois . Ann . - Yes , sir ? Get on the computer . I want a complete list ... of every time the Missouri and the Illinois were together ... - during the first three months of 1 945 . - Yes , sir . - [ Speaking Japanese ] - Hai . Stinking old man . See that ? That 's traditional . You know that , Joe ? Put a man like the sergeant in a shack in the middle of the Pacific ... and he still has to have a touch of beauty around . One stinking flower . [ Chuckles ] Okay . How do you wanna die ? You want me to shoot you right here and get it over with ? - We 're non-combatants here , Lieutenant . - Non-combatants ? - Yes . We 're scientists . - [ Laughs ] Missionaries . That would be better story , Joe . That might move me . I might let you live . Tell me you are missionaries . But scientists - That doesn 't wash at all . Look , if you 're gonna shoot us , go ahead and do it . - You got good nerves , Joe . - The name is not " " Joe . " It 's " " Newman . " All Americans are " " Joe " to me . All of you look alike to me . I can 't tell the difference . All right , Lieutenant , what 's the point of all this ? - What 's your game ? - How 's your ankle ? - What difference does it make ? - Lots of difference . Stand up . I wanna see if you can walk on it . I said get up . You 're in good shape , Joe . That 's fine . Now , outside , both of you . - [ Speaking Japanese ] - Hai . Outside . No tricks . I could shoot you both before you could touch me . Okay . That 's far enough . All the Yankees like a little action , right ? Well , I 'm gonna see that you get it . - [ Speaking Japanese ] - Hai . I told him to shoot you if either of you move . He 's an old man , but he 's been in the army long enough to learn how to shoot . When he gets back , I 'm gonna jump him . You take off when I do . No . No , we both stay , or we both go . - [ Chopping Wood ] - He 's a psychopath . Yes . And that may just work to our advantage . He 's so full of bitterness , it 's eating him up . Now he 's gonna have to humiliate us before he can kill us . Either of you Joes know what kendo is ? - It 's a Japanese sport . - Ah . Smart boy . When I was at Stanford , there was a kendo team ... but not for long . I broke a man 's arm with a stick like this . Here , Joe . We 'll see how you do . Oh , I 'll bet you 're probably pretty good against a man with one lame foot . - Try me ! - You 'll have your chance . Here 's your big opportunity , Joe . Don 't goof it . You kill me , you knock me out ... then you only have one old man against you ... and he 's not much . - Here , let me do it . - No . Back off , Joe . What are the rules of your game ? [ Shouts ] No rules , Joe . You try to break my head , I try to break yours . No ceremonies . [ Shouts ] - [ Shouts ] - [ Speaking Japanese ] That 's the way , Joe . You 've got it . [ Shouts ] [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Laughs ] How about it ? You gonna let me kill him ? If that 's all you wanted , you could 've killed us inside the shack . But you 've got to prove that you 're superior ... and you can 't do that if you kill a man while he 's down . You 're a smart man , Joe . How about it ? You ready to start begging for your lives ? You might reach me , you know that ? I was educated in your country . - I might be a soft touch . - I don 't believe that ... - anymore than you believe I 'll beg . - Oh , I hope not . That would spoil the sport . Get up ! - Try me without the sticks . - No . I like the advantage . It makes me feel good . You know what I mean ? - Secure . - How about it ? - Is it my turn now ? - No . I have something else in mind . You mad enough now , Joe ? You need more provocation ? - For what ? - To kill me , of course . But then , maybe you didn 't need it because I 'm the enemy . They taught you to want to kill us , didn 't they ? That 's the whole point . Kill the enemy . Slaughter him ! We 're all alone on this island , the four of us . The odds are about even . One of you Joes has a bad foot . I have an old man . That makes us even . - What are you talking about ? - " " War . " That 's the name of the game . We have our own war here . You against us . You kill us , or we kill you . - That 's fair enough . - Obviously , you were in our country ... long enough to have learned that we don 't play with death . No , I 'm serious about this . And you don 't have any choice . - I think we do . - Not when you know what 's at stake here . Here we are , the smallest island in the group of islands . Here is an island called IwoJima . Have you heard of it ? - We 've heard of it . - IwoJima is the only airfield ... between Saipan and Tokyo ... and you Yankees have to have this one before you can take it . If the Americans want it , there 's nothing to stop them from taking it . That 's what we intend for you to think , Joe . Your battleships have forced us out . This afternoon , your forces will return to secure the island ... expecting to meet no resistance ... but they 'll be wiped out by a massive aerial attack . - Why are you telling us this ? - To give you a stake in the game - Something to play for . I 'm going to give you one hour to get away ... and then the sergeant and I will come after you . Maybe you 'll get lucky , Joe . Maybe you 'll get us . If you do , you get the radio as a prize , and you can warn your forces . And you really expect us to go along with this ? Sure . With stakes like that , you really don 't have any choice . - And what about weapons ? - [ Laughs ] That 's something you don 't got , Joe . Use some of that Yankee ingenuity of yours . The jungle is full of things you can use to kill a man . All right . But , first , tell me one thing , Lieutenant . Why are you going to all this trouble ? You must feel that you can get us , or you wouldn 't be setting this up . - Why ? - You Joes have cost me too much . This is my way of paying you back . One hour from now ... that 's when it starts . [ Chuckles ] And you 're right , Joe . I 'm going to kill you both this time . - Wait . Let 's take a break . - Look ... if I can 't go anymore , I 'll tell ya . Oh , it 's not the foot . We 've got to circle around and go back . - Go back ? What for ? - He 's armed , and we 're not . He 's gonna have a hard time finding us in this jungle . I don 't think he was bluffing about that ambush they 're going to set up for the marines . Doug , whatever happened on this island is already a part of history . - We can 't change it . - But we don 't know what happened here . And even if we did , it wouldn 't make any difference ! He really got to you , didn 't he ? You 're gonna play his game . You 're gonna do just exactly what he wants you to do . Let 's just say I don 't like running . If he wants a battle , he 'll get it . But it 'll be on even terms . Look , if you wanna sit this one out , I don 't blame you . You said it before-What happens to one of us happens to both of us . Well , it 's senseless . That 's what it is . They should hole up and stay put until we can get a fix on them . They 've gotten involved . That 's what 's happened . That 's what 's the matter with them . They 're two young men , and they can 't back away . Well , we 've got to help them , General . Neither of them have had any experience in jungle fighting . From the map that Nakamura drew in the dirt , I 've narrowed it down . That 's IwoJima here . And I think they 're on either ... Kita-Iwo here or Minami-Iwo . Both these islands were shelled by the Americans ... during the two days before they invaded IwoJima ... on February 1 9 , 1 945 . Was there a Japanese withdrawal from either of these islands during those two days ? That 's the problem , General . The records of the campaigns on both the islands were destroyed . We took the islands , of course , but we don 't know exactly how or when . Well , General , there must be survivors of the campaigns ... - somebody who would know for sure . - Ann , call the Pentagon . Have them locate the nearest survivor and get him here fast . Right . We 'll go on the assumption that they 're on the southernmost island , Minami-Iwo . - Set your instruments . - General , I say we wait until we know for sure . I think we have to gamble . Set your instruments . - You think we can take him ? - No . He 's too alert . He thinks we might try it . He could cut us down with that rifle . - What are we gonna do ? - I 'll go ' round back to the supply room . Now you stay put . No false heroics no matter what happens . [ Wood Cracking ] [ Creaking ] - [ Lieutenant Speaking Japanese ] - [ Sergeant ] Hai . [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Lieutenant Sighs ] - Do you speak English , Sergeant ? - Some . Yes . - But you don 't like to speak English ? - I speak as the officer wishes . " " As the officer wishes . " Right ? You 're a man of the old school , aren 't you , Sergeant ? Whatever the authority says , you do . Hop to it , get in there and slug it out . [ Lieutenant Sighs ] - You know who I am , Sergeant ? - Yes . Then why don 't you kill me ? You think I should die , don 't you ? - Yes . - Then why don 't you kill me ? It 's not for me to do . Get out ofhere . Watch the front . They might decide to make it easier for me and come back . - [ Speaking Japanese ] - Hai . [ Lieutenant Sighs ] [ Door Closes ] - [ Lieutenant ] The time is about up . - [ Sergeant ] Hai . [ Clattering ] Hey , Joe ! What happened ? Well , I got these for my trouble . Hey , Joe . ! You hear me ? [ Speaking Japanese ] The sergeant said you got five grenades . Why don 't you just lob one in here and get it over with ? Pow ! Just like that , and it 's all over . But you can 't do that , can you , Joe ? You might destroy the radio , and you can 't take the chance . Can you , Joe ? Well , I 'm going to give you better odds . You 've got more room to work with now , Joe . Maybe you can get me without hurting the shack . - How ' bout it ? - No . - That 's what he wants . - How ' bout it ? You move to throw that grenade , he 'll get a shot off . He 's liable to get one of us . We can 't take that chance . - Are you cowards ? - We 'll fight him - when he 's not expecting it . You hear me ? Why don 't you just lob one in here and get it over with ? Are you cowards ? Is that what you are ? I 'm giving you a chance . Take it . ! Come on . I don 't understand . It 's almost as if he wants them to kill him . - I got the same impression . - We 've just got word from the Navy Department . The Missouri and the Illinois were both engaged ... in the shelling of Minami-Iwo on February 1 4 , 1 945 . Then that 's our island . - Have you heard from the Pentagon ? - Yes . They contacted a man from thejapanese consulate who was on Minami-Iwo . They 're flying him here by military jet . If he can pinpoint the landmarks on the island , we 're in business . - How 's the foot ? - It 's all right . You know , if we could string something between these two trees - - A booby-trap . - Yeah . We 'll need - I don 't know - a piece of vine ? I 'll find something . [ Chopping ] - How 's that ? - That 's great . That 'll do it . Tie it to that tree . You know , that sergeant 's been here a long time . He knows this jungle . How far off the ground ? About an inch . I 'm General Kirk , Dr. Nakamura . I 'm very grateful that you could interrupt your busy schedule to come here . I 'm afraid you 're going to be disappointed , General Kirk . I cannot help you . As you promised , the Time Tunnel is very interesting ... but I should not have come . I came here so that I could explain to you in person . But you were on Minami-Iwo , weren 't you , Doctor ? It was a very bitter time for me , General . I was with the Imperial forces there . Yes , I can understand that ... but all we want from you is your knowledge of some of the landmarks on the island . It 's desperately important . The lives of two of our scientists are at stake . - Lives are at stake ? - There 's gonna be a battle soon . We know that . We 've got to get them out before it begins ... but , of course , if your government needs to be notified - No , it is not a government matter . It was something very personal , very painful . But if lives are at stake , of course , I will do what I can . Thank you . This way , please . Dr. Nakamura , Dr. MacGregor and Dr. Swain . - Doctor . - I 'm very pleased to know you . Now , if you don 't mind ... I would like to make the identifications as quickly as possible . Of course . Oh , to fill you in , Doctor ... you 're seeing the island of Minami-Iwo ... on the afternoon of February 1 7 , 1 945 . [ Nakamura ] Yes , that is Minami-Iwo . I commanded thejapanese forces that withdrew on the morning of the 1 7 th . Can you identify this for us ? Both the man and the place . That is the spotting station . The man is Sergeant Itsugi . I knew him well . Now can you tell us who the other officer on the island was ? There was no officer . The sergeant was the only man left behind . - Ann , see if you can get an image on him . - He 's coming out now . [ Gasping ] Impossible . He was dead . He was dead ! Are you all right , Doctor ? Anything the matter ? He is alive . He is not dead . You know this man ? He is my son . - What happened ? - Shock , I 'd say . He fainted , but this should bring him around . I have the signals for Doug and Tony again . Now comes the tricky part . All right . Hold the pin . You wanna get back ? 'Cause if I 've made this vine too tight , it 's gonna go off before we want it to . - Now how do we get him here ? - We do a little advertising . - Explode one . - What good 'll that do ? He 's gotta check it out . Watch it . They 've got class , Sergeant . Style . Cover me . Clever , Joe . Clever . [ Laughs ] - [ Gunshot ] - Good try , Joe ! Better luck next time ! Get ready to move out . Two grenades . That 's all they have left , Sergeant . [ Breathing Heavily ] What kind of soldier are you ? You 're supposed to like killing , the smell of battle . If necessary , I kill . - But you don 't like it . - No . Go on back to the shack , old man . You don 't belong here . - I stay . - [ Speaking Japanese ] Hai . Did I hear you correctly , Dr. Nakamura ? - Did you say he 's your son ? - He was a kamikaze pilot ... ordered to attack the battleship shelling us . But , at the last moment , he could do it . He crash landed . My men pulled him ashore , but I could not help him . He had dishonored us . - I left him behind when we left . - To commit hara-kiri ? He spent too much time in the States . He came to value his own life too much . He forgot the teachings of his childhood . What do we do now ? Well , first , let 's rest that foot of yours . About that lieutenant , do you believe his story ? About thejapanese coming back ? I think it 's part of his game . He 's a psychopath . He 's dreaming . Aren 't theyJapanese ? - They sure are . - They 're scouting the island . They are getting ready to come back . Looks like the lieutenant was telling the truth . Our only chance of getting out of here alive ... is to get ourselves picked up by the fleet . The radio back at the shack . I 'll stay here , take care of the lieutenant . You try to get to the radio . No , you 're better with radios than I am , and , besides ... you 're liable to have your hands full back there . That lieutenant 's smart enough to anticipate a move like that and send the old man back . Let 's both take care of the lieutenant first . That 's too risky . What if we get pinned down ? We 'd never get to the radio . You 're right . Give me a grenade . I 'll try to get a message out . I 'll meet ya back here in this general area . [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots ] Hey , Joe ! You having trouble up there ? That 's a bad spot . Terrible . You could get hurt . Where 's your friend , Joe ? He should be in on the party too . Bad shot , Joe . No touchdowns for you . You might as well come out . Your friend 's not gonna make it ! You 're all washed up , Joe . ! [ Airplanes Approaching ] We 've reached a Mexican standoff , Lieutenant . I can 't get out of here , but neither can you . You won 't be able to have any cover against the next grenade . I can wait , but you can 't , Joe . You saw the planes ? My boys will be all over this island pretty soon . That won 't do ya any good . I heard what you said to the Sergeant , remember ? Why are you supposed to die , Lieutenant ? Are you a deserter ? I can take you . I can kill you . I can do that . And I can kill you if you try . Now what 'll that prove ? Nothing . I have to kill you , and you have to kill me ! There 's nothing to be gained by my killing you or you killing me . We both wanna live to go home . I can 't go home ! I don 't have any home anymore . No more talk , Joe ! Come on , Joe ! I 'm in the open ! It 's your turn ! Come on ! Kill me ! You have your chance ! Kill me . ! Answer me , Joe ! You still alive ? It 's a lousy trick . You 're not supposed to die without killing me . Come on . Fight ! Come on ! I was wrong . I should not have let him go off to die . I want you to bring him back . I want my son . Dr. Nakamura , that 's impossible . We 're already stretching to the limit of our equipment to make a double transfer . The you can save only two ? - Yes , sir . - Now , if you 'll just take a look - - No . - I beg your pardon . I did not ask to come here ... and , before I did , I 'd accepted the fact that my son was dead . But now you have brought him back to life ... and I will not suffer his death a second time . Can we get someone else to help us ? There 's no time . Doctor , our first responsibility is to our boys there . We put them there by accident . We 've got to get them off . Unless I identify the landmarks , you will get neither one of them . Unless you agree to bring back my son as one of the two men ... I will not help you . General , he can 't mean that . Talk to him . Convince him . I don 't think he 's bluffing . Do you ? No . A man doesn 't bluff when the life ofhis son is at stake . There 's no chance of a triple transfer ? General , I only wish there were . Well , that leaves it up to me . We 'll take the one who is closest to thejapanese lieutenant at the countdown . You 'll make your primary fix on Lieutenant Nakamura . Dr. Nakamura , I 'm going to ask you to reconsider . Even if we do bring your son back here ... the psychological problems he 'll face will be almost insurmountable . There 'll be a 23-year gap in his life , a void . The only insurmountable thing in this world is death . I will not reconsider . Very well . You leave us no choice . We will bring back your son . I will look at your map now . All right , Joe . It 's one man down , and one to go . Maybe I 'll have more luck with your friend . [ Gunshot ] Put your hands up . That must be the American landing force . Switch over . You will remember your bargain , General . Switch back to the radio shack area . See if we can pick up the Lieutenant . [ Explosions ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] [ Laughing ] [ Continues Laughing ] [ Laughing ] - [ Laughing ] - Doug ! - Did you send the message ? - No . Radio 's out . - What about the lieutenant ? - He 's in the shack . - [ Laughing ] - He 's gone out ofhis mind . Let me see your rifle . Lieutenant , can you hear me ? I hear you , Joe ! It 's all over for you , Lieutenant . You know that now . If you 'll come out and surrender ... I 'll see to it that you 're treated properly ... in the hands of the Americans . Lieutenant , now you must decide . Will you die honorably ... or will you live in shame ? What 's the matter with him ? He 's thinking it over . I have signals for both boys . Which signal is the stronger ? They 're both the same . We have both signals . I think we ought to take them all . Ann , it would kill all three men for sure . Well , then make your decision . Which one do we save ? Which one ? - No . Wait . - We can 't wait any longer , Dr. Nakamura . A bomb or a shell could hit that area at any moment . You were right , General . He has finally realized who he is . I will not take that from him . Leave him there . Bring back your two men . Reset the controls . The lieutenant is staying behind . [ Airplanes Passing Overhead ] [ Gunfire ] This is it , Joe . You have to do it . I 'm not giving you any choice . I can 't do it . [ Gunshot ] Don 't shoot ! We 're Americans ! Why didn 't you give up when you had the chance ? I 'm Japanese , Joe . I forgot that - but only for a while . What are you guys doing here ? - Who are you anyway ? - It 's a long story , Sergeant . What was he doin ' running around in a white kimono ? Made a perfect target . He was a man that was fighting his own private war , Sergeant . And I think he 's found his victory . [ Speaking Alien Language ] We don 't understand you . - We mean no harm . - Who are you ? What is this place ? [ Electronic Beeping ] You are now ... in a translation circuit . You are intruders ... from another dimension . - From which planet do you come ? - We 're from the planet Earth . We are from Alpha 1 ... operating under space directive Lentos ... for a test raid ... against primitive Planet 1 - 6 . Our terminology is different . Can you show us Planet 1 - 6 ? Tony . They 're going to attack Earth . Tell him to resume his position . Get back . We haven 't got a chance against them , not here . We can 't let them do it . [ Laser Firing ] When we leave the Earth , we will leave no life on it . It will be a dead planet .

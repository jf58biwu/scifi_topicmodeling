 Wowee . Gosh . Don 't break it . Need a hand with this bag , ma 'am ? Sir , I don 't know you . The very idea . Wow . I want a room - a big one . Yes , ma 'am . And you mind your tongue . It 's Miss ... Miss Kitten Twitty . Yes , Miss Twitty . Thank you . Well , well ? Kitten ... Twitty . Well , don 't just stand there . Get my key . Oh , yes , the key . Yes , ma 'am . About time . Excuse me , ma 'am , may I help ? Looks heavy . Well , that 's very kind of you . It is awfully heavy and me just out of the hospital . Thank you . Whoo ! Be careful , careful . It 's got my French perfumes - very fragile . I 'm sorry . That 's all right . I 'm in room eight . My , I hope it 's safe here . Oh , it is safe . I 'm in room nine . Oh , that 's right next to mine . I wonder what the period 's for . Oh , this is a lovely room . Where would you like me to , uh ... Oh , over on the bed . Fine . That 's very sweet of you . Right up there . Be careful now . They 're very fragile . Thank you . Oh , that 's so nice of you . This is a nice room , isn 't it ? Won 't you sit down ? Oh , no , thank you . I was just on my way across the street to get some shaving soap . Well , maybe we can visit later . Maybe . Toodle-oo . Bye . ♪ ... livelong day ♪ ♪ I 've been working on the railroad ♪ ♪ Just to pass the time away ♪ ♪ Don 't you hear the ... ♪ ♪ Rise up so early in the morning ♪ ♪ Can 't you hear the captain shouting ♪ ♪ " Dinah , blow your ...

" ♪ He 's coming , he 's coming . No , no , don 't get up . You 're not supposed to stand on your leg any more than you have to . That 's why I brought the wheelchair for you . Are you quite sure he needed a shave ? Oh , yes . And I fixed the water just the way you told me to . Hmm . Then we 're all ready for him , aren 't we ? Mmm . Oh , Kitten , the things that are going to happen to his mind are fantastic . The strange things he 'll see . I 've just shoved him through a door into a world without rhyme or reason . His eyes will believe what his mind tells him to believe and , oh , what his mind will say . Just imagine - now I 'm finally powerful enough to control the mind of the invincible James West . Those whom the gods will destroy , they first make mad . Ooh . Shh ... Sorry . Come here . Kitten , do you know what 's about to happen ? Something so vast as to stagger the imagination . Alexander the Great , Caesar , Napoleon , all the great conquests of history - mere child 's play compared to what I 've just started in that room with a shaving brush . Now ... With the two ounces I just put into his washbasin a few minutes ago , he 's had the maximum dose and he 'll have no further need for this ... for a while , anyway . Oh , Kitten . It 's so amusing - the way men pride themselves on being civilized . But just four ounces of this , mixed with water , absorbed through the skin , and good-bye , adieu , ta-ta to all that veneer of civilization they prize so highly . Dissolved . And what emerges is the true nature of man - the primitive , murderous animal he really is , with absolutely no control over his feelings - a selfish beast . I wanted a candy , Kitten , and you 've eaten all of them . Now , I had my heart set on a ... Ooh ... fudge ! Fudge , fudge ! Fudge ! Well , my dear friend . Ha 'penny for your thoughts . Now , don 't spoil it , Mr. West . You 're so impulsive . Now , here we are , two old friends who haven 't seen each other for such a long time , and you want to fight right off . Not even a hello , Mr. West ? I , for one , am overjoyed to see you . So much so that perhaps I shan 't even kill you right at this moment . I 'll wait ten seconds or so , perhaps . Time enough for me to sit here and enjoy your company . Ten precious seconds . What seems to be the trouble , partner ? Did you see him ? Where 'd he go ? I didn 't see nothing except you come barging out of the hotel with your shooting iron in your hand . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Nothing ? He must be crazy . Nothing ? Huh ? Hey , Jim . Just let me get my bags , huh ? Would you mind punching me ? Well , I 'd be happy to oblige . Tell me why . I just want to be sure I 'm here . You 're here . You all right ? Why ? You know , you look , uh ... pale . Naw , it 's just a headache , a bad headache . I 'll tell you about it in the room . It 's next to mine . Yeah . You sure you 're okay ? I 'm not sure of anything . I told you not to jump up and down . Oh , Kitten , forget about that . Now , to make a man kill the thing he loves , that requires genius . And I know what 's going to happen , Kitten . I 've tested it , I can predict it . Tonight , the good and loyal Mr. West will shoot his best friend , Mr. Gordon ... and kill him . Three times we 've caught him , and each time he 's managed to get away . Just doesn 't seem to be a jail built strong enough to hold him . And just when we think we 've got him nailed , boom , up he pops somewhere else . As a result , you 're obsessed with him , that 's all . Got him on your mind constantly ; you see him everywhere , I can understand it . All right , so I 'm seeing things . This , uh , poster that you got with this note written on the back - " Meet me at 8 : 00 in the abandoned shed behind the stables and I 'll turn Dr. Loveless over to you . " Artie , I know what it says . I , uh , had the handwriting analyzed , Jim . It was written by none other than the little doctor himself . Why don 't I go get a doctor ? No . I 'm all right . No , I 'm not all right . We 're not going to go to that shed tonight with me like this - it 's too risky . If it was anybody else , I 'd go , but Dr. Loveless isn 't anybody else . Tell you what , I 'll go over there right now and take a look ; you get some rest . Okay , I 'll go with you . No , what for ? The rest will do you good . I said I 'll go with you . You 're sure ? All right . Jim ? Aren 't you forgetting something ? Hold it , Jim . Hold it ! Why are you running ? He could already be in there waiting . You 're right . It would be like him to think ten steps ahead . Well ... he 's got to come through this door , and we 'll be waiting for him . One of us should stay all afternoon ... in case he comes early . I 'll do it . You go on back to the hotel , take care of that headache . Artie ! What is it ? Nothing . Listen ... go on back to the hotel , will you ? I 'll wait here for Loveless . Call it off , you can 't do it alone . Says who ? I 'll be fine . You can 't do it alone ; you 'll need help . Jim , you 're in no condition to stay . Then you wait until I 'm ready ! And let Loveless get away ? What do you want to be , a hero ? Hey ... it 's me , remember ? Artemus Gordon , Mrs. Gordon 's son . I 'm sorry . For a moment , Artie , you ... it was almost like I hated you . Yeah , sure . Come on , I 'll walk you back to the hotel . Jim ... put out that lantern . Is that an order ? What 's the matter with you ? You want him to spot us ? Put out that lantern . Get down ! Jim ? He 's out there . You want to get shot ? ! We 'll wait for him . When he comes in , we 'll get him . Get out of my way . I am not letting you out of here in this state . I said get out of my way . No . Why ? Call the sheriff ; I just killed my friend . His name 's Artemus Gordon . He got off the stage this morning . What are you talking about ? There was no stage this morning . It doesn 't come in till tomorrow morning . What are you talking about ? I met the stage myself . I saw him . He 's got the room next to mine . Believe me , there was no stagecoach in this morning . Uh , your friend isn 't here . I 've got his room down for tomorrow . Look for yourself . He isn 't dead , is he ? No , but he 'll soon wish he were dead . But we won 't let him die , will we , Kitten ? Not for a long , long time . Oh , how he 's going to beg for it . Whoa ! Mr. Gordon ? Yeah . Well , I 'm the hotel clerk here . Uh , it 's about your friend . Uh , is anything wrong ? Well , maybe we 'd better talk inside . Yeah . All right , something is wrong , what is it ? Well , a lady , uh , a Miss Kitty Twitty took your friend to the hospital last night . Why , is he hurt ? No , sir , it 's worse than that . What do you mean ? Well , he went mad . What ? Yeah , stark-raving mad . He was running around out there in the street and a-waving his gun and talking to himself . And then he comes rushing in here last night and he tried to tell me that he killed ... Killed who ? Well , he claimed that he killed you . Me ? Yeah . Oh , excuse me , I got to tend to these folks first . I 'll be right back . There is no escape , Mr. West . Ultimately , we are all prisoners , are we not , Mr. West ? Because we cannot escape ourselves . Stone walls are never so much a prison as the skin that surrounds each of us . Man 's fate . My friend there is a deaf-mute . That 's his prison . But for you ... some sherry . It will do you good . It 's safe . I imagine you 're bursting with questions . You 'll tell me . How can you be so sure ? Because I know you . You 're always talking ... about yourself . Bragging . That 's preposterous . I 'm not a petty man . I 'm a scientist . I 've trained , disciplined myself to be serenely dispassionate . To accuse me of bragging ... you may as well accuse the sun of being egocentric because it shines . Mm-hmm . Really , you can be quite exasperating . What kind of remark is that ? " Mm-hmm . " I 'm not quite sure why I put up with you . Because you need me . I need you ? Now who 's being egocentric ? I don 't need you . I don 't need anyone . I have myself . You were an experiment only . And the experiment ... succeeded . Beautifully . But I can discard you any time I wish . Aren 't you even curious about the experiment ? No . Not even if I should tell you that with it , I can own America - all of it ? No . Not even if I should tell you that with it , I can kill every man , woman and child in America ? No . That 's what I am going to do - kill every man , woman and child in America . Now , what do you think of that ? Here - let me help you up the stairs , may I ? Oh ... Our visiting hours are over , Mr. Gordon . But I think , for you , we can make an exception . Jim ! Hey , Artie . Is that really you ? Yeah , in the badly bruised flesh . Who were you expecting , President Grant ? But ... but I thought I shot you . You 've done a lot of things to me in your time , but you never got around to that . Hey , what 's the matter ? I remember . That great experiment Dr. Loveless was talking about . He did it ... to me . Hallucinations . He made me think that I shot you . And he 's planning to use it on every man and woman in this country - make them kill each other . Isn 't that kind of a big order , even for Loveless ? But it worked ! It worked on me . It nearly drove me out of my mind . Yeah , but everybody ? Millions of people ? Ah ... how ? I don 't know . But we 're going to find out . When he talks to you , don 't pay any attention , and then he 'll tell us everything . Well , Mr. Doubting Thomas , now that your friend is here , perhaps I can show you a few things . No . I 'm not interested . Well , then be interested . Oh , no , you 're not going to tell us about another one of those silly inventions of yours . Silly ? Yes . I 'll show you . Here we go . Kitten , mix that with some of that . Now , be careful you don 't get any on your hands . Some of my powder that I used to mix in his shaving water yesterday morning . You know what happened to you . Perhaps you would like to be convinced , huh ? Hold out your hand . All right . It can work on Artie . What does it prove ? You made one of your usual boasts . You said it could work on everybody - millions of people . That 's preposterous . It 's not preposterous . I can show you how it 'll work on large groups of people . Kitten ... the wine the staff is having for supper tonight - mix that in it . But , Doctor , we can 't ... we ... Never mind . I 'll do it myself . It goes very well with wine , you know . You 'll find out for yourselves at supper tonight . Kitten ... how many people on this staff ? Twenty . 20 men and women ... just like that , to prove a point . He doesn 't mean it . He 's ... he 's just trying to scare you . But they 're all loyal to him . He knows that . He just wants to kill the others . The others ... includes you . No . You don 't understand . He love ... he likes me . He ... he 's promised to make me ... make me pretty . Loyalty doesn 't mean a thing to him , Kitten . Please believe me - you 're next ! What are you doing in here ? I thought you 'd be in the dining room . It 'd be great sport , watching 20 men and women tear themselves apart . He 's only playing with you , having his little joke . He wouldn 't do a thing like that . Things are going right on schedule . You 'll see , Mr. Doubting Thomas . Look at him , Artie . Men are about to murder each other . Look at him over there with Antoinette . Like a couple of turtle doves . You know , uh , she may be the only thing in the world that he really cares about . Well , she is very pretty . Mmm . ♪ Lullaby and good night ... ♪ Let 's eat . ♪ With roses bedight ♪ ♪ With lilies bestead is baby 's wee bed ♪ ♪ Lay thee down now and rest ... ♪ ♪ ... now and rest , may thy slumber ... ♪ ♪ Lay thee down now and rest ♪ ♪ May thy slumber be blessed . ♪ You are invincible . Is there anything you cannot do , are there any worlds you cannot make to live in ? No , none . The world I wish for is the world I shall have . You have spoken . Kitty , the door , please . You may have to clean up a bit of mess , dear . This is too solemn a moment for gloating , Mr. West . I feel no wish to boast . Do you know what tomorrow is ? No . The end of winter . Tomorrow , everywhere except in the breast of man , the chill will begin to thaw . Small things , so fragile , will be born again . So much promise . And by the end of spring , the promise will have flowered . Mr. West , you cannot know the deep hurt one can feel when the seed cannot reach its full flowering . For in the summer , man comes . Man comes to crush and maim and kill all that spring has given birth to . So summer must not come , nor man . Man must be destroyed . But there are millions of people in the country - how ? Why , the water , Mr. West , the water from which all life comes , and from which now death must come . There are ponds and lakes all over this area . My friend here ... and his friends - thousands of them - come here every winter . Tomorrow , they will return to their homes , their hills and ponds and lakes all over America . Each one will carry a pellet of my powder . The pellet will melt , bringing death into every home . The world will be made innocent again . The world ? Other people in other countries also use water , Mr. West . I intend to travel . And , uh , when do we get killed ? Oh , soon . Don 't be impatient . You know , he has really gone insane . Artie , you look a little peaked . How about a snack ? I appreciate your concern . Right now , I 'd rather worry about Dr. Loveless . Worry and eat . We need a weapon , don 't we ? What are you going to do , choke him to death on a bone ? Something like that . Well , fortunately , I never get enough turkey . Would you mind telling me what you 've got in mind ? Oh , just an idea . I need a little time to work it out . You wouldn 't have any giblet gravy in your pocket , would you ? Ever kill a man with giblet gravy ? That 's the best turkey I ever ate . That ought to be sharp enough . That 's perfect . Load it , Artie . Easy on the suspenders , friend , huh ? That 's the only pair I 've got . Hope they fit . I 'll be back for the rest of you in a few minutes ! Don 't want to leave anyone out - not one ! Today is for all of us ! It 's useless to try and shoot this lock off . Kitten ! Kitten , come here . Kitten , you 've got to let us out of here . We have to stop him . Oh , he only wants to make the world beautiful again . How , by killing people - his own friends ? He didn 't do it . They killed each other . The medicine only made them what they really are - evil . He 's the one that 's evil . He doesn 't just hate people . He hates life itself . Well , can you blame the poor little one ? I know he can do it . He can do an operation . He can make pretty faces , and pretty bodies where there was only ugliness before . He said it to me . " I know , Kitten . " I know what it 's like to have men laugh at you . I don 't ever want that to happen to you again , " he said . I believe him ! He knows what it 's like . All right , he can do all that . But what good is it being beautiful when there 's nobody around to notice it , Kitten ? The men send flowers , gifts , jewelry . And with their strong arms and their kisses . You 're entitled to love . And a man of your own picking . Dead . All murdered by him . We 've got to stop him , Kitten . You can 't let him kill all your admirers . Kitten , open the door . I won 't ! No , I won 't do it ! You can 't make me do it ! I love him . I love what he is . I love him , do you hear ? He knows what heartbreak is . He knows what loneliness is . He knows what it is to live with a hurt that nature herself can 't undo . Kitten , what have you done ? I 've betrayed him ! I 've betrayed him ! Ooh , soon you 'll own the skies now and the ponds and the lakes . Never again will danger lurk in weeds and rushes . And marshes will be safe again . No loud violence from iron and steel and powder . No sad plummetings from the dawn skies . No piteous scattering of feathers in the dawn wind . The evil will be destroyed , I promise you ! I promise this to all of you ! A world without man . Man - that ape who pretends to be descended from the angels . We 'll have to grab him . He may be armed . And in his insatiable hunger for power , he creates gods in his own image - mind you , in his own image , and chooses to call the universe benevolent . What arrogance ! Where is there benevolence when even a small , helpless , trusting , new life can be twisted heartlessly and condemned to pain and ridicule ? We are all born trusting . We are all born with hope . And what happens ? It is a vicious universe , I tell you . But with one move of my hand on this lever , I send you forth to rid the world of evil . Now ... Loveless ! Get away from that ! Stay where you are , Mr. West . If you shoot me , my hand will move this lever , and the cages will open at once - all of them - and there will be no stopping these ducks . Artie , I can 't hold it ! Quickly ! Our escape must be now ! Hurry , Miguelito - the boat in the lake ! Hurry ! I think that 's it . Let 's go ! Do you think they can swim ? There 's only one way to find out . I 'm afraid , Miguelito ! I 'm afraid of the water ! Antoinette can 't swim , and neither can I. Can you help us ? Can you save us ? Please , you 've got to . No , I can 't swim , either . I 'm afraid , Miguelito ! I 'm afraid to die ! Don 't worry , my darling . Everything will be all right . We shall both live forever . It 's no good . I couldn 't find a thing . I couldn 't even hit bottom . They 've been there over ten minutes , Jim . They 're dead for sure . Where Loveless is concerned , I 'm not sure about anything . You just don 't want to believe it , that 's all . But he 's gone . Back to the water he always said life came out of . Maybe you 're right . Maybe hate is as strong a bond as love . What do you mean ? I 'll miss him - that little man with the giant rage against the whole universe . As Kitty said , who can blame the poor little one , huh ? Come on .

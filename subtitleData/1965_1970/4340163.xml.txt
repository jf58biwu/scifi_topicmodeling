 NARRATOR : How does a nightmare begin ? For David Vincent , architect , returning home from a business trip , it began at a few minutes past 4 on a lost Tuesday morning , looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a welcoming sign that gave hope of black coffee . It began with a closed , deserted diner , and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . In the weeks to come , David Vincent would go back to how it all began many times . [ NARRATOR READING ON-SCREEN TEXT ] Starring Roy Thinnes . With guest stars Diane Baker , J.D. Cannon , James Daly , John Milford . [ NARRATOR READING ON-SCREEN TEXT ] Highway 166 , dirt road , Bud- - Wait a second . Bud 's Diner . Well , anything else , Mr. Vincent ? I know it sounds wild . There was this- - There was this light , a kind of glow . Yes , you told us that . Anything else ? Well , no , I got out of there right away . I came here . I see . Show him in . Now , look , that ship landed just over an hour ago . It could still be there . Now , if you want me to go , I 'll go with you . Oh , I don 't think that will be necessary , Mr. Vincent . - David , what happened ? - Alan , what are you doing here ? They woke me up to ask me if I have a partner who sees things . So I- - Oh , excuse me . My name is Landers . I 'm Mr. Vincent 's partner . I thought maybe I could help . I know who you are , Mr. Landers . I appreciate your coming down , but I think you told us everything we needed to know on the phone . They wanted to know if you were really on a business trip . Then they told me some wild story about your claiming to have seen a space ship . I 'm afraid it 's true . I know , it shook me up too . HOLMAN : Mr. Vincent , you 've driven a long way in the last 20 hours . I 'd like to suggest you leave your car here . Mr. Landers or one of my men will drive you . I 'm not going anywhere until you do something . You 're gonna need those notes to find the ship . - It 's 6 a.m. and we 're all a little tired . - Stop playing games with me . I insist you do something . Well , it seems to be Kelly 's Diner . You said Bud 's Diner . Ready to go home now , Mr. Vincent ? It came down right over here . It stretched out , uh , from about right around in through here . It looks as if nobody 's been around here for a hundred years . Alan , I saw it . Look , I 'm no crackpot , you know that . I really saw it . All right , David . [ GUNSHOT ] Hello . Say , I was driving out here last night and I saw something very- - Excuse me . Vincent . - That was a good shot . - Thank you . I 'm Detective Lieutenant Holman . We 're investigating an incident reported last night by Mr. Vincent here . Uh , what sort of incident ? Were you around here last night ? At what time ? - All night . - All night ? Well , yes , see , we have this camper truck parked up behind the big tree over there . My wife and I , we , uh , were just married . How long have you been camped here ? Uh , two days . At approximately 4 : 20 this morning , did you see or hear anything unusual ? - No . - Nothing . How can you be sure of anything - at 4 : 00 in the morning ? - Mr. Vincent , let me . BRANDON : Well , look , you see , we were awake , you know ? We were getting ready to go fishing . I mean , uh , there was nothing . Well , you must have seen something . I drove in here . I parked at the diner . Now , if you were awake , you must have seen me . I 'm sorry . - It was here . Right- - - Wait a minute , Mr. Vincent . Sorry to have troubled you . Oh , I 'll need some identification for the report . Well , I , uh , do have a driver 's licence . I suppose you 'll be in the vicinity a few days in case there are any further questions , Mr. Brandon . Uh ... . Well , we had planned on going back today . Pretty short honeymoon . Yes , it is . Well , I have to get back to my store . But , uh , we 'd be glad to stay until tonight . Thank you , Mr. Brandon . Oh , uh , congratulations on your marriage . Thank you . Mrs. Brandon . - What do you want ? - I wanna ask you a question . Did you change the sign on that diner ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . We agreed to stay until this evening , but we have to go . Quickly , get the truck . It 's past time for me . You , you go away . Nobody has hurt you . - I wanna see your hands . - We have to go . - Take off those gloves . - We have to go ! Hurry . Hurry up . What happened ? Do you remember anything ? Oh , the truck . I almost got out of the way it must have sideswiped me . Don 't try to remember anymore . - Take these . - What are they ? Something to help you get back to sleep . No . No . Otherwise , we will be forced to administer it intravenously . Will you take these now ? Arthur Gordon ? What are you trying to do to me ? What is this ? You 're one of them , aren 't you ? [ YELLS ] Help . Help me . For God 's sake , help me . All right ? Oh , yeah . Fine , thanks . MAN : David . Oh , hi , buddy . David , I wanna tell you how sorry I am about what happened yesterday , but I was afraid in a larger hospital there might be reporters , and people who would twist the story of what you saw . I didn 't wanna take a chance on your making any calls , and I gave them a phoney name . I tried to tell you yesterday , but they had you too heavily sedated , I couldn 't . As it stands , one of the papers did get wind of your accident , - but I think I talked them out of using- - - Accident ? You don 't remember ? Holman says your car went off the road and you were thrown clear . No , no . That 's not the way it happened . I , uh , brought some magazines for you . The doctor told me you can go home tonight . And I don 't wanna see you in that office for at least two weeks . - They 'll have your car fixed- - - Will you listen to me for a moment ? I found some proof . I can 't show it to you , but that man and woman at that camper truck , they were some kind of alien being . I know it . There was something about their skin . They- - They started to glow . And their hands , the bone structure was different . David , please . That 's over now . It 's not over . You 've gotta talk to Holman and find out everything you can - about that man and woman . - No more . Not now . We 'll talk about it later . I 've got to get back to the office . We 'll talk about it this evening when I pick you up . I promise . It wasn 't easy , but I got the name and address of that honeymoon couple from Holman . Mr. and Mrs. John Brandon , 285 Front Street , Kinney . Kinney ? It 's a little town between San Luis Obispo and Bakersfield . David . I want to believe you . Thanks . [ SIRENS WAILING ] All right , get those other people . You all right ? Come on , let 's go . - These look like the last ones . - All right . Dennis , - bring up that ladder . - There 's an old woman up there . Better go check her out . Let 's have those flag poles up here . All right , Dennis , where 's the ladder ? Any idea how it started ? The old woman , she must have done it . Pete and Phil , they broke through . There 's nobody there . - No body . No nothing . - Well , she 's- - WOMAN : Can I help you ? I 'm Mrs. Adams . I run this place . Looks like you lost a town somewhere . Where is everybody ? Our total population is down to 12 now . And that 's including the two dogs and my little Siamese cat . Thank you . Doesn 't seem to affect business . Oh , the sign ? That just means we 're not open to the public right now . Golly , it 's hot . I 'm , uh , looking for someone . A man and a woman named Brandon . - They gave this as- - - Pardon ? Brandon ? A man and a woman ? They gave this as their last address . Brandon . Gee , I don 't think I 've- - Sorry , it doesn 't ring any bells . You can check the register , but if they were clients of Mr. Kogan 's they wouldn 't have registered . DAVID : Who 's Mr. Kogan ? Well , I don 't suppose there 's any real secret to it . Mr. Kogan 's the head of the investment group that 's buying up this town . I think they 're going to turn it into one of these retirement cities . - How do you go about buying a town ? - Well , I- - First , you gotta find the right town . Then you just walk in with a suitcase full of cash . Howdy , my name 's Carver . I saw your car outside . - You , uh , looking for someone ? - A couple of friends . Well , they probably moved away . This used to be a going town until the state closed down its hydroelectric plant . Oh , a few of them are still holding out , but in the end , they 'll sell . Does that include you ? No , I sold out just after my husband died . I 'm staying on as a sort of caretaker until Mr. Kogan 's group takes over . Sometimes he sends clients down here . CARVER : Mind if I have some lemonade , Kathy ? - Oh , no , go right ahead . - Thank you . Uh , when Mr. Kogan does bring his clients down here , what do they do ? - Hunting and fishing , I guess . - Where ? Gee , you know , I don 't know . Let 's see , there 's a wooded lake a couple of miles north of here . And there 's the river , of course . - Where 's that ? - On the other side of town . Gee , I 'm awful sorry I couldn 't be of more help . No , no , thank you . - Really . - Thank you . - So long . - Goodbye . When is Lieutenant Holman due back ? Well , tell him he was right . That psycho of his did show up down here . I 'll keep an eye on him . MAN : Kinney speaking to Bakersfield control , red alert , red alert .

[ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON JUKEBOX ] Have you got a telephone that works ? Pardon me , do you have a telephone ? - What ? - Do you have a telephone that works ? No , they ain 't pulled that one yet . Operator , I wanna make a collect call to Santa Barbara . The number is 555-5235 . My name is David Vincent , I 'm calling Mr. Landers . Alan , it 's David . I 'm in Kinney . I think I found something , some proof . Alan , you 've gotta come up here right away . If you don 't get here right away , somehow it 'll all be gone . I 'm not sure I can get away right now . Look , they 're here in Kinney . They may be- - They may be all over this planet . Now , I need a witness . Just one witness . Look , Alan , if I can 't ask you , who can I ask ? I 'll be there as soon as I can . All right . Now , there 's a hotel on Front Street here . I 'll be waiting for you there . Thanks , buddy . I see you 've found the sole entertainment centre in Kinney . Yeah , I heard the music . Have you met Mr. Kemper ? He 's one of our last holdouts . And those are the Ackerman girls . They live just outside of town . Can I offer you some coffee ? - Oh , that 's a good idea . - Good . Deputy Carver 's looking for you . He telephoned Santa Barbara . Hey , you don 't look like a dangerous psycho to me . I 'm not . If you 're worried about him , don 't be . He already checked here . It 'll be a while before he comes back again . Here . - Is something the matter ? - No . Now , how long has Carver been in town ? A few months . Uh , he came in about the same time the Kogan people began buying up the town . Doesn 't what Carver said about me bother you at all ? Mm-mm . Just because you happen to see certain things doesn 't mean- - Who said anything about seeing things ? Carver . Oh , I 've been through this before . For months before my husband died , he kept saying over and over- - Well , what did he see ? No . Well , how did he die ? Well , it- - It was a heart attack . - Tell me what he saw , please . - No . It 's over . He 's dead and I don 't wanna talk about it anymore . Please , don 't go . Mrs. Adams , I need your help . - I wasn 't sure I could talk . - I 've gotta take this- - - Look , Mr ... - David Vincent . - Mr. Vincent , I- - - Will you sit down here and just listen to me for a moment ? Please . I 'm gonna tell you something you won 't believe . Someday I 'll get them all . There were transparent tubes large enough to fit a human form . Now , I think they need these tubes to regenerate themselves somehow . I don 't know . - If I could see them , see something . - Yeah . Well , maybe when my friend gets here . I want you to see them . Because , Mrs. Adams , when Kogan finishes buying up this town , his people are gonna take over . They 'll have a foothold , and it 's gotta be stopped . Because who knows how many towns like this there are in the world . All right . All right , is there anything I can do to help you ? Do you believe me ? I don 't know what I believe . Just tell me what I can do . - Is your aunt still at the motel ? - Yes . Tell her that my business partner is coming here . He 'll be here in a few hours . His name is Landers . I can call her from here . Yeah , that 's a good idea . And tell her to have him meet me here . But don 't let Carver find out about it . - Look , what was his name again ? - Landers . Landers . If that Vincent fella comes back here , Aunt Sara , try and stall him , all right ? I 'll certainly do what I can do . We don 't think he 's dangerous . Things seem to happen when he 's around . Fires , accidents , you know ? We just wanna keep an eye on him . All right . Thank you , Lou . Oh , Mr. Kemper , I 'll close up . - Uh , we 're waiting for a friend . - Oh . Okay . - Good night . - Good night . It 's funny how a man 's life can change so fast . After I saw that saucer , it seems as though I had been cut off from everything , piece by piece . Was it the same with your husband ? Kathy . Yes . Yes , it was the same . You know , I 've been thinking . What happened to him might not have been a heart attack . They could have ways of arranging that . If that 's true , then it could happen again with you . No . I 've already talked too loud and that fire in my apartment was their last safe shot . Anything more would cause a lot of attention , make people think maybe I was right . CARVER : Kemper ? [ DOORKNOB RATTLES ] Kemper ? Maybe your friend won 't come . - Nah , he was delayed . He 'll be here . - How can you be sure ? - He 'll be here . - Why should he really believe ? You saw what happened when you told the truth . Suspicion , right ? Ridicule . It 's going to happen again , you 'll see . He 'll be here . [ TYRES SCREECHING ] - I 'm sorry . I didn 't see you . - Oh , that 's all right , that 's all right . You are looking for Mr. Vincent , aren 't you ? Why , yes , that 's right . Well , he said you were to meet him at the power station . You 're to park your car there . - Here . - Yeah , go on . Did you hear a car just now ? No . Oh , David . Hey , forget about him . Look , he won 't come . He 's no different than anybody else . Nobody wanted to hear the truth from my husband . They just wanted to sell at a profit and get out of this town . A lot of things killed him . Hate , greed , ignorance . If he 'd thought about it , he would 've wondered what he was fighting for . What is there in this world that 's so special , so worth preserving ? You still have time . You can think about that . [ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON JUKEBOX ] Why did you do that ? You know I 'm listening for Landers . [ MUSIC STOPS ] David , David . I did it to wake you up . Don 't spend your life listening for cars that will never come . Looking for faces you can never find . Fingers ? We 're not all like that , David . Some of us learn . We 're always learning . Don 't go . Don 't fight us . You can 't stop it . It 's going to happen . Don 't go . Don 't fight us . No , don 't go . Alan . Alan . Alan ! David . David . Alan ! CARVER : Hold it , hold it . Now , easy , Mr. Vincent . Now , don 't be afraid . I 'm not gonna hurt you . We have to get into that power station right away . Sure . Now , look , if you 're not one of them , you gotta help me . Sure . My partner 's there . He 's alone . - They 're gonna kill him . - Sure . First thing , I 'll call Mr. Kogan . If it 's all right , we 'll go take a look at his power station . Oh , no . [ SCREAMING ] Alan . Alan . Alan ? Alan . All right , Vincent . They did it . Sheriff , they- - What happened ? What is it ? - Nothing , Mr. Kemper . - What ? Just a sick fella who got a little out of hand . You two help me load him into the car , will you ? What a shame . He looked and talked so normal . You just never know . Good to see you , Ben . Four or five years now . HOLMAN : Well , Vincent , he 'd still be alive today if he hadn 't wanted to believe your crazy dreams . Sheriff Carver checked out the power station . Except for him , there was nothing . No , there wouldn 't be , not now . The coroner 's report was heart attack . Whatever you think , that 's the way it was . Sure . Ben , what do you want me to do with him ? - Let him go . - Let him go ? That 's right . Let him go . Well , I don 't know why you came here , Vincent , but don 't come back . No reason to . Not anymore . Lieutenant . I know I can find an answer to this if you 'll only help me . This is the final word , Vincent , the bottom line . For your own sake , let it end here . Whatever you 're planning , let it end here . I wish I could . NARRATOR : How does a nightmare end ? Not here in the forgotten town of Kinney . Perhaps in Bakersfield . Perhaps at some undiscovered beachhead in another state , or another continent . Perhaps , for David Vincent , it will never end .

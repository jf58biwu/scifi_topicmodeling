 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . Everything must be destroyed . Everything . We must leave nothing for tomorrow morning . I will see to it , Tasaka-san . - Everything , in every office . - Hai . ! How did you get in ? We , uh - We sort of came in by mistake . - What are you doing here ? Who are you ? - We 're tourists . Uh , just sightseeing . Nobody sightsees inside thejapanese consulate . I assure you . We didn 't know this was thejapanese consulate . Everybody in Honolulu knows that . The day before the attack on Pearl Harbor . In thejapanese consulate . Leave the consulate at once . Please . Try for a time lock , quick , before we lose them . Power , all units . We 're sorry to have intruded . They are spies . Why let them escape ? Because their superiors would trace them to us ... and it would be dangerous to create an incident today . - Follow them . - Hai . - If they make one suspicious move , kill them . - Hai . ! Wow . Out of the lion 's mouth . They must have been burning their secret codes ... getting ready for the attack tomorrow morning . I wonder how far away Pearl Harbor is . We used to drive it in 1 5 minutes . My father and I. Your father ? When was that ? I was living here at the time on this very day . I was seven years old . My mom had died the year before . I was staying with my dad . He was a lieutenant - a lieutenant commander - shore-based here at the naval station . What happened to him ? I don 't know . He was reported missing after the attack . Never found , dead or alive . Doug ! Whatever did happen to him ... he 's alive now ! December 6 , 1 941 ! I can see my father again , find out what did happen to him , maybe warn him . I 'm with you , Tony . We 'd better get to him as soon as possible . Where was he based ? In the naval base ? Wait a minute . I remember I spent that day with , with , uh - with Billy Neal . That 's right . He was my best friend . And later in the day my father came . He came for dinner . He oughta be there right now ! The Neal home isn 't far from the base . I think I can find it . Come on ! [ People Conversing ] - Good evening . - Good evening . - This is the Neal home , isn 't it ? - Yes . You are expected ? No . But we have important business with your dinner guest . Come in , please . - Please wait here . I 'll tell Mrs. Neal . - Thank you . [ People Continue Conversing , Faint ] Will you know him when you see him ? He 'll be a tall man . And just about my age right now . - [ Woman Laughs ] - [ Conversing Continues ] It 's , uh , strange to hear them enjoying themselves ... when they have no idea what 's going to happen in the morning . This house was destroyed . The fire bombs scored a direct hit on it . Hello . - I 'm Louise Neal . Can I help you ? - Yes , Mrs. Neal . We 're sorry to break in on you , but it 's urgent that we speak with Commander Newman . - Is he here ? - No . But he 'll be here any minute . He 's bringing the admiral to dinner - - Is it about my husband ? - No . Forgive me for asking , but the situation is so tense these days ... and my husband is an officer aboard the Enterprise . He 'd hoped to be here tonight for dinner , but the Enterprise won 't reach Pearl Harbor ... until around 8 : 00 tomorrow morning . [ Knocking ] I 'm here to observe the two Americans who just arrived . Come with me . You can see through here . [ Mrs. Neal Continues , Faint ] - Who is coming ? - The butler , Ichiro . He 's not one of us . His sympathies are with them . [ Groans ] [ Knocking ] [ Mrs. Neal ] Never mind , Yuko . I 'll answer it . Make sure no one else comes in here . [ Man ] Hello , Louise . The admiral will be here in a little while . [ Man ] Hello , Louise . The admiral will be here in a little while . - Mm-hmm . - Is little Tony behaving himself ? Of course . They 're having a wonderful time . These men have come looking for you . Excuse me , please , while I go look after the children . What can I do for you ? Have we met before ? Yes . Many years ago . That long ago ? You must have been very young . Yes , sir . But I 've never forgotten you . You wanted to see me ? We 've come to warn you , sir . If you go to the base tomorrow morning ... your life will be in danger . What do you mean ? Somebody 's trying to kill me ? Oh , no . Please don 't ask us to explain . We can 't . And if we did , you wouldn 't believe us . But if you do go there ... you might die . What , are you drunk ? Is this some kind of a threat ? Who are you ? Please , you 've got to believe us . - We 're trying to save your life . - I want the truth here , or I 'm gonna call the police . Sir , we know for absolute fact ... Japan will launch a mass air attack on Pearl Harbor ... tomorrow morning at 7 : 55 . - Well , that 's impossible . It couldn 't happen . - Sir , it will happen . Their fleet couldn 't approach us without our knowing about it . Japan has deployed one third of her fleet toward Indochina ... to make us think that her next move will be southward . But at this very moment , the other two-thirds ofher fleet ... are approaching Hawaii from the north . What 's your source of information ? At Annapolis you studied higher mathematics . - Even thought ofbeing a mathematician . - How did you know that ? You 're familiar with relativity mechanics . - The concept and use of time as a real dimension . - Yes . And that it 's possible to travel in time as well as space . [ Chuckles ] Well , maybe . It 's only a theory . Years and years into the future . Exactly . We come from the future . In days to come , Commander , every American will know the words , " " Remember Pearl Harbor . " Remember what at Pearl Harbor ? Remember the attack we just told you about tomorrow morning ! Well , you 're not drunk ... so all I can assume is that you 're a pair of lunatics . Commander , please , you 've got to - In either case , I find your behavior highly offensive , if not dangerous . - Daddy , Daddy . - Yes ? What is it , Tony ? Can Billy and me stay up later tonight ? Can we , Daddy ? It seems to me it 's getting kind of close to your bedtime . Please , Dad ? Just tonight ? Commander Newman , can Tony and I stay up and play ? Say it 's okay . Please ? Please ? Billy , you know what you promised when I said Tony could sleep over tonight . You said you 'd go to bed on time . But we 're just in the middle of a game . You can finish your game in the morning . Now , both of you , go to bed . The kids will be in this house when it 's destroyed ? Sir . There 's something else . The reason why I came to warn you . The reason is ... as strange as it might seem , I - Shall I serve dinner , Mrs. Neal ? Not quite yet , Yuko . Please ask Ichiro to open the wine . Oh , his wife telephoned . She 's very sick , and he had to go . - Oh , I 'm so sorry . - But I will take care of everything . Thank you , Yuko . - I hope the admiral won 't be long . - You go . Now , look , if you 're nervous about an attack , ship out to the States . Don 't spread panic . Yuko will show you out . This way , please . [ Whispers ] Let 's go . Make no sound . Move out door . - What 's wrong ? - We 've lost our lock on the boys . Get them back . Their lives are in danger . Little Tony 's too . - TheJapanese fleet . - On their way to Pearl Harbor . - Can 't you get back to the boys ? - I 'm trying , but the fix keeps drifting . - Have the Americans talked ? - Not yet . They only tell crazy stories nobody would believe . I am told you refuse to cooperate . We 've explained everything . He doesn 't believe us . Lies ! They take us for fools . It is imperative that we establish the leak and how far it has gone . There is no leak . Who are you ? We told him . We 're scientists . I shall make a bargain with you . If you tell me the truth , I will release you in the morning ... and you will have saved your lives . You 've got to believe us . We 've traveled through time . More lies ! - I 'll make them talk . - Wait . We have a more efficient way ... to make people tell the truth ... a method developed by our allies , the Germans ... and used successfully by their gestapo . [ Speaks Japanese ] Start with this one . It is called truth serum . This is the first evening I 've been able to relax in quite a while . Any special reason , Admiral ? We got a report this afternoon ... thejapanese fleet was sighted off the coast of Indochina . That means they 're heading south . Well , that 's very strange . A civilian told me the same thing . A civilian ? [ Chuckles ] Just a lucky guess . He also told me thejapanese are going to attack Pearl Harbor tomorrow morning . Another one of those doomsday prophets ? I must get 1 0 of those predictions a day . Well , forget it . How about another drink ? The children are sleeping at last . - Louise , I 'm sorry . I 'm going to have to leave . - So early , Tony ? Why ? There 's something I want to check on at the yard . - All right . Excuse me . - Admiral . - It was a great pleasure . - Thank you . - Good night , sir . - Good night . [ Doug ] We are scientists ... on a government-sponsored project for the exploration of time . You know you can trust me . Why do you keep pretending that you come from the future ? I do . That 's how I know about your plans . What else do you know ? Your next move , after Pearl Harbor ... will be the Philippines , and then Guam . - How could you know that ? - It is history . Then perhaps you can tell me - Will our attack on Pearl Harbor be successful ? Yes . It will be the decisive action of the war ? No . Then what will be the decisive action ? Hiroshima . Hiroshima ? In Japan ? Then who will lose ? You . Impossible . We can 't lose . We 're getting nowhere with this one . Try the other one . He told you the truth ... about us , about where the war will end . Do you want me to tell you about the atomic bomb ? Tom , I just sat down with the admiral . He told me he 'd gotten a report on the main Japanese fleet . - About a third of the fleet . - Off Indochina ? Uh , heading south . The appraisal is that 's their next move - south . Yeah , that 's what the admiral said . Well , it makes sense . What do we have from Washington ? Same appraisal . No alert . Tom , will you authenticate that Indochina report for me ? Why ? What 's all the sweat about ? Just do it , will ya ? Just do it for me . Okay ? Okay , if it 'll get that gut-busted look off your face . Can you get it ? It , uh , it may take some time . Yeah . I 'll wait . How did you get into my office ? The Tunnel . Time Tunnel . Nonsense . We 're getting nowhere . Who sent you here ? The United States government . Ah . Then you are a secret agent . No . Then why are you here ? What is your immediate objective ? My father . My father and the children . All this talk of time tunnels and children - meaningless babble . We gave you a glimpse into the future ... but you won 't accept it because it destroys your dream of world empire . It 's a trick . Your government has found a way to brainwash its agents . Have you told anyone else about our surprise attack ? Yes . Yes . We told Commander Newman . - Is this true ? - Yes . - But he didn 't believe them . - How can you be sure of that ? And you let him get away ? Find that man - Commander Newman . Silence him . No . No , he thought we were drunk or crazy . He 's no danger to you . You would be wiser to be concerned for yourself . Shall I finish them ? Your discovery of our surprise attack ... is of such critical importance ... that I must report it to Tokyo . Guard them . [ Rings ] Hello ? Yes . Mrs. Ichiro ? Is anything wrong ? No , Ichiro isn 't here . He left early . He told Yuko that you were ill and he had to go home . Well , at least I 'm glad you 're not ill . I 'm sure he 'll be home soon . No , no need to apologize . Good night . [ Rattling ] - What do you want here ? - Where 's Commander Newman ? He 's not here . He left hours ago . Who are you ? - I told you he 's not here . - I have checked at his home and other places . He must still be in this house . - That hall leads to other rooms ? - To the children 's rooms and my - Stop , or I 'll shoot you . If you go near those children , I 'll kill you . I 'm going to call the police . [ Dialing ] Operator , give me the police . No , no , no . Put me through to the navy yard . Well - No , don 't call the police , Louise . I think I know what it 's about . It 's an intelligence matter . Don 't worry , I 'll - I 'll send a marine guard to your house . Okay . Good-bye . Thank you . That 's the way it really was . The way it really is . They 're taking off for the attack . Ray , you 're locked on the enemy fleet . We 've got to find Doug and Tony . They may be dead . I know , Ann . I 'm doing everything I can . Intensify the probe . The Neal house and little Tony . Thank heavens he 's all right . [ Planes Droning ] Get rid of that sound ! [ Droning Quiets ] - Clear the focus . - This is the best we can do . We can 't just leave them to be murdered or killed in the bombing . Is the time fix good enough to try for a transfer ? - Anyplace is better than where they are now . - No . With a drifting fix like this , in trying we might kill them ourselves . We 've got to take the chance ! What 's the matter , General ? Little Tony - he 's gonna sleep over in the Neal house . Well , I know , but it 's our Tony we have to get out . Oh , no , it can 't be . - It can 't . - What ? What , you mean if little Tony is killed , our Tony might cease to exist ? Theoretically . The logical fact is that little Tony must have escaped . - Tony lived to grow up . - " " Logical . " Who can be logical about something we know so little about ? Or there 's the possibility if our Tony dies in 1 941 , little Tony might cease to exist . - We 've got to get them both out ! - Their lives are interlocked . We 've got to improve the time fix . It 'll be too late . Too late . Only an hour and 1 5 minutes left . Tasaka should have been able to contact Tokyo by now . If only my father had believed me ... or if we 'd had a chance to talk to Mrs. Neal . [ Phone Rings ] I have just received an answer from Tokyo . It 's being decoded now . Hold on . [ Shouts In Japanese ] Kill them ! Hai . [ Rings ] - Communications . Anderson . - Is Commander Newman there , please ? He just stepped out . He 'll be back in a few minutes . Is there anything I can do ? No.Just tell him that Louise Neal called and - and everything seems to be all right . I 've sent the marine back to the base . Would you want the commander to call you back , ma 'am ? No . I 'll be seeing him later this morning . Thank you . Good-bye . Ah . You just missed a call from Mrs. Neal . She says everything 's all right . Any new confirmation come in about thejapanese fleet ? No . Looks like you got yourself all worked up over nothing . Report from the radar room ? Yeah . They 're all going off for breakfast , and I 'm going to follow their example . Look , it 's going to be a nice , quiet , peaceful Sunday morning . So why don 't we all just relax and enjoy it . TheJapanese are going to attack in less than half an hour . - We can 't just stand here and let this happen . - Jerry , it did happen . - They 're all going to be killed ! - That was in 1 941 . This isn 't just a picture . - This is the real thing happening , isn 't it ? - That 's right . We 're looking back into time to what 's happening . Then let 's try to do something about it . Jerry , someday you 'll realize ... that all men have to live with their past . It can 't be changed . Keep knocking . Somebody 's got to answer . - Yes ? - It 's an emergency , Mrs. Neal . We 've got to talk to you . Oh . Yes , last night . Come in , please . - What 's the matter ? - You 've got to get out . AJapanese air attack is on the way . They 'll be here in 30 minutes . This house is in the target area . You and the children go up to the mountain . That 's what you came to tell the commander last night ? - Yes . - That 's why he hurried back to the base . Still , it 's strange , his sending you to tell me . Please , Mrs. Neal , believe us . We haven 't a minute to waste . I can prove that we 're telling you the truth . - Where is your maid ? - Well , she didn 't come to work this morning . - She won 't . - No , because she 's a spy . She doesn 't want to be around when the bombs start falling . My husband 's ship is headed right into it . I 'll get the children . - Mommy . ! - Billy , um - We 're going to go on a picnic . - Now , won 't that be fun ? - A picnic ? But only if you dress as fast as a fireman and go tell Tony . But , Mommy , I 'm trying to tell you - Tony 's gone . - Gone ? Where ? - I don 't know . He got out ofbed a little while ago . Said he thought he heard his daddy talking . Then he ran out the back way . Billy , did , uh - did Tony say where he was going ? No . Where 's the picnic going to be ? Are you coming ? I know a good place on the mountain for a picnic . He 's gone . We 've only got 25 minutes left . Well , we 've got to find him . - Mom , where 's the picnic going to be ? - Up on the mountain . You get dressed . Don 't waste any more time . We 'll find him . - All right . - He 's got to be around here somewhere . But where ? Where did I go that morning ? - In the garden ? - You look in the garden . I 'll look through the house . Come on ! - No luck . - Not a sign of him . We 've only got a few minutes left . - Can 't you remember where you might have gone ? - I 've been trying . I can 't ! Surely on that morning , of all mornings , you must remember something . Surely on that morning , of all mornings , you must remember something . No , I - You 've got to remember ! We can 't leave without the boy . Without you . It must have been the shock of the bombing . It wiped out everything . All I can remember is - is running and running . You must have been outside the door . You must have heard what was said about the coming attack . I ran to warn my father . Well , that 's it ! - Where 's he going ? - He 's going to catch little Tony . Oh , thank goodness . Tony ! Tony ! - Tony . - Who are you ? My name is - is Tony too . I know where you 're going . - I gotta hurry . - Don 't worry about your father . He means as much to me as he does to you . - But he 's my father . - I know , I know . Now I want you to do something for me . Hurry back and go with Billy . But don 't tell him what we know about the attack . It might frighten him . Remember now . I 'm trusting you . I 'll get to your father . Anyway , I can run faster than you . Promise ? I promise . The others are dressed and ready . Tony , you go with him . What about you ? He 's going to save my father . Come on . Look at the planes . I bet it 's maneuvers . Let 's hurry , children , as fast as we can . [ Bomb Whistling ] [ Explosion ] [ Explosions Continue ] You 'll be all right now . Just keep on going . - There 's something I have to do . - All right . Take care . - [ Explosions Continue ] - Hurry . Hurry , children . [ Air Raid Siren Blaring ] [ Bombs Whistling ] [ Air Raid Siren Blaring ] [ Beeping ] I 've done all I can from here . - What about thejapanese consulate ? - That 's my next move . [ Beeping Continues ] [ Explosion ] [ Air Raid Siren Continues Blaring ] Hey , I-I 'm looking for - Have you seen Commander Newman ? Communications . You can cut through there . [ Bomb Whistling ] [ Explosion ] Take everything down to the car . Careful with that radio . We 'll need it to contact the submarine . [ Tires Screech ] The American spy ! And sailors ! Coming in ! Lieutenant , that 's their car . They 're inside . Come on ! Move back in there ! They 're the ones . He 's the chief . - Take them . - I 've got to get back to the base right away . - Take their car . - Right . [ Machine Gun Fire ] [ Ann ] He 's alive . ! [ Car Horn Honking ] Tony ! I came as quick as I could . We 'd better be ready to transfer them . Calling Enterprise . ! - Calling Enterprise . ! - [ Explosions Continue ] Calling Enterprise . Keep calling . We have to stop her from coming into Pearl . Calling Enterprise . - [ Bomb Whistling ] - [ Explosion ] [ Explosion ] [ Ticking ] [ Ticking Continues ] - It 's a dud . - No . - It 's still ticking . - It has a delayed-action fuse . It 'll go off in a few minutes , maybe seconds . - Take your hands off the controls ! - What are you doing ? - We 've got to do something ! - What ? How ? We could relocate that bomb in another time zone . It may kill innocent people in another time zone ! Doug and Tony are heading for that room . They 'll be killed when that bomb explodes ! [ Ticking Continues ] Where has it gone ? We can 't spare the time to find out . We must stay with Doug and Tony . [ Ann ] It 's the bomb . ! Send it somewhere else ! We can 't . It 's locked in automatic . - I 'll disarm it . I know how . - We can hold it only 90 seconds . - Then it returns automatically . - It may explode in less than 90 seconds . All personnel leave immediately ! And , guards , seal off the control area from the rest of the complex . Ann , you go along with them . You too , Ray . - I 'll stay here and helpJerry . - I 'll try to hold it a little longer . I 'll help you , Ray . [ Ticking Continues ] [ Tunnel Oscillating ] Ray , can you hold the time lock a little longer ? We 're almost finished . Did you disarm it ? I don 't know . I 'm not sure . [ Explosions Continue ] We were trying to reach the Enterprise ... warn her ... to turn back . We 'll send a message . If it 's still in commission . No , it 's my job . I 'll do it for you , sir . - Lie still . I 'll get help . - You 're bleeding . Save your strength . This is what I 've been saving my strength for . The switch - [ Panting ] Hello ? Hello , Enterprise . Hello . This is Pearl Harbor . We read you , Pearl Harbor . Come in . We are under attack . This is not ... a maneuver . I repeat - this is not a maneuver . Turn back . [ Man On Radio ] Roger . [ Panting ] They got it . They got it . You said you knew me ... a long time ago ... and that you 've always remembered . My name is - is Tony Newman . Tony Newman . I know you . I know you as well as I know my own son . I - I am your son . It 's good to know my little boy will survive . [ Sighs ] Come on . There 's nothing else we can do here . [ Horns Honking ] [ Bomb Whistling ] [ Explosion ] Nothing . There 's nothing left . That 's why my father was never found . [ Bomb Whistling ] [ Explosion ] We can 't wait . We 've got to transfer them before they 're killed . Their chances of surviving a transfer are better than living through that bombing . Try it . [ Switches Flipping ] [ Ann ] Little Tony 's all right . You 're drifting . Try to get back to Doug and Tony . We 'll try for a time lock . Doug ? There ! Fire ! Tony . [ Whispering ] Tony . ! Tony . [ Gunfire ] Tony ! Over here ! Am I glad to see you . Buckskins ? We 're gonna need them too . Come on . Keep low . Who 's trying to hunt us down ? Looks like we got caught in the middle of a battle . There are troops all over . - What kind of troops ? - I don 't know . From the looks of these trees and these buckskins ... we could be somewhere in the southern United States . Where and when ? We 're gonna have to find a better place to hide until we get our bearings . Let 's go . Over there ! Get after them ! [ Gunshot ] They 're heading toward the American line !

 American International Television But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night , in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise . And the elements shall melt with fervent heat . The Earth also , and the works that are therein , shall be burned up . IN THE YEAR 2889 The geiger counter here in the studio reads 632 Renchens . That 's six times more than enough to kill a man . Down through the ages , the prophets have forewarned us that in one day thousands of years of accomplishments could be wiped away by the destructive hand of power . Now that day has come . All communication with the outside world has stopped , just 15 hours after the first nuclear bomb fell on Formosa . The whole world has been silenced , annihilated by nuclear bombs . Three billion people murdered by a thousand nuclear bombs and the lethal fallout . Maybe there 's no one left to hear my voice , no living human being to record the end of the world . Now , this is Ted Johnson for K.B.G.E. - Radio . He didn 't come , Dad . Larry didn 't come . He 's lost . They 're all lost . Not a sign of life : New York , Paris , Moscow ... All 's quiet now . Look , Joanna ! It 's holding at 47 ! Why , we may be saved ! Just as I planned it . I 'm not sure I want to , Dad ... not without Larry . I 'm sorry , honey . I 'm afraid he didn 't make it . But there 's always hope . Come , let 's go inside . I planned it right , Joanna . Our house out here , miles from any city . The cliffs . The updrafts of air to fight back the radiation . And provisions for the three of us for months . There 's only two of us now , Dad . Honey ... I couldn 't very well order Larry to come out here and stay with us , even though you are engaged to him . There 's someone at the door , Dad . It 's Larry - he 's made it ! - Wait ! Don 't open that door until you 're sure it 's Larry ! - It is Larry ! He 's hurt ! - He 'll contaminate us ! - Larry ! Larry ! - Don 't ! Don 't open that door . We can 't take the chance ! - Let me go ! I 've got to open that door ! Wait ! Don 't touch him ! He 's red-hot with radioactivity ! It 's not Larry ! - We 've got to help him , whoever he is . - Wait . We 'd better check the geiger counter . 740 Renchens ? And he 's still breathing ! Why , he should be dead ! But he 's still breathing ! Nobody can take that much and still live . Don 't touch him . He 's my responsibility . - Who are you ? - I 'm Steve Marlin . He 's my brother . Better keep away from him . Granger ? It 's OK , it 's OK . God , he 's still alive . - Don 't know why , but he 's still alive ! - He must be dying . The counter showed 740 Renchens . Where are the bedrooms ? - Upstairs . Come with me . - No . They can 't stay here ! - Yes , they can , Dad . - But they 're contaminated . It 's too late for them . But not us . I 'll get you some water and clean clothes . - Get out of here or I 'll kill you . - Don 't shoot ! There 's a girl out here . Throw your weapon on the floor . I warn you . - This gun 's loaded ! - OK , OK ! Stop it , Dad ! Don 't ! Move on into the room , here . Come in where I can see you . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I guess so . - Is ... is it OK if we stay ? - Of course you can 't stay ! - I 've got provisions for only three people . - Mac , we 're staying , so forget the sob story . Please , mister , help us . You can 't stay here ! It isn 't the way I planned it . I have provisions for three people only . I 'm Joanna Ramsey . Please , bring your suitcase upstairs and I 'll get you some fresh water . Wait ! I didn 't mean nothin ' . I was just looking to see if anyone was alive in the house . What 's your name ? I 'm Tim Henderson . I 'm a rancher . I live up on the cliff . - Sorry I roughed you up . - Sure . Come on ! ... How 'd I knock you down ? - Come on up the house . - No ! He can 't stay ! Oh , let the worthless old coot stay . We 're all gonna die anyway . It looks like we 're stuck with each other , so let 's understand the rules . Now , I 'm the ranking officer - I mean , person . I 'm in command . If we 're voting ' , I vote for me . - Oh , don 't be funny . This is serious ! - Shut up , Jada . My second-in-command will be Steve . This counter is registering 47 Renchens of radioactivity now . 50 is considered dangerous . 500 , fatal . But that depends on the individual . Different people have different absorption rates and capacities . We may live , and we may not . There 's a lot we don 't know about it . Some of us may be dying now . - Well , how long before we can leave this museum ? - Yeah . I 've got some things working for me in L.A. - big things . So how long before we can get out of here ? There is no Los Angeles . No Los Angeles ? You 're kidding . I don 't believe you . There are no radio signals , long or shortwave , from any city in the world . She 's right . The six of us in this house may be the beginning of a new era . A new civilization . Seven . My brother 's still alive . But not for long , I 'm afraid . But be that as it may , I 've spent ten years getting ready for this day . I 'll brief you as to why we 're still alive . This is my house , with its own generators and food supply . These cliffs , surrounding the house on three sides , are full of lead-bearing ore that acts as a barrier against radioactivity . The lake here on the fourth side is heated from an underground heat source , probably an old volcano or maybe a crack in the Earth 's crust . Anyway , the warm air from the lake 's waters creates an updraft . And it 's strong enough , I might add , to carry radioactive contamination out of the valley . As long as it doesn 't rain . If the rains come too soon , we 'll all be contaminated and die . That is , if we don 't let other forces destroy us before that time . What other forces ? Never mind that now . But make no mistake about it : You 're not welcome here . This was planned for just three people . That 's how much food we have . If we divide that among the six of us , we 'll soon have empty stomachs and rebellion . I have the keys to the storeroom . I , and I alone , will say when and how much food we eat . Any argument about that , and I 'll settle it with this . Oh , you 're a big man , packing ' that gun . Just don 't you let go of it . I don 't intend to . Where are you going with that ? - My brother . - Save the food . Your brother 's a casualty , face it . Take it to him . Dad , I 've never seen you like this before . We can 't become animals . We 're still human , and we 've got to act like it ! That 's just what I 'm afraid of . We 're all human . Granger ? How ya doin ' ? I 'm not gonna die . I thought I was , but I 'm not . I know I 'm not , now . Well , it 's a miracle . You soaked up 700 Renchens . I don 't understand it , but I 'm glad . - Here . Try something to eat . - I don 't want that . I need fresh meat . Raw meat . Well , I 'll put your order in with the chef . I don 't know , but ... I think it 'll do me good . - Well , why don 't you wash up and get into some clean clothes , huh ? - No . No water . Just let me rest . I 'll be OK just the way I am . You didn 't tell me how you two happened to be near this valley yesterday . Uh , we 're not exactly on the main highway . We were camped on the other side of the lake . That 's not too far off the highway . We were on our way to California . I thought it 'd be a kick to sleep out . Yeah . Then her old car wouldn 't start , and we were stranded . You two married ? She 's an old friend of the family . Look , kid , you can be a friend of my family anytime you want . Jada 's a performer , a dancer . I 'm her manager . I ... I guess it was stuck . Now you know why she can 't work with a fan . Nice looking guy . Your brother ? My fiance . He was supposed to be here yesterday . You were gonna marry him . I 'm sorry . Really sorry . What 's the matter ? Strange ... I felt like I heard someone calling . But not really calling . Just something strange . Come on , snap out of it . Let 's go to your father 's storeroom and see if we can find some canned beef for my brother , huh ? Steve , come with me . I want to check the radioactivity outside . Go ahead , Steve . I 'll get the canned beef . How we doing , John ? It 's at 49 . That 's up 2 since last night . It 's as if some magic force is holding those clouds up out of this valley . - That 's the warm air from the lake . Creates an updraft . - Yes , I know . - Oh yes , I told you this morning . - I 've known about this valley for a long time . The lake , too . Read about it in college , in Geology . - Oh , you a geologist ? - Mm-hmm . I worked for an oil company about 100 miles south of here . Then you just didn 't stumble in here yesterday by accident ? No , my brother and I headed here the minute we heard about the bombings . Smart thinking on your part . Do you know the real force of the atom has never been fully calculated ? Well , I think it reached its fulfillment yesterday . Yes , but only as we know it affects our present form of life ... or life as we knew it , before this nuclear inferno covered the Earth . You think some other form of life could have survived ? I 'm only saying that its true force has never been fully understood . You 're confusing me now , John . - Do you remember the H-bomb test at Matsuo some years ago ? - Sure . I captained one of those ships . 5 days after the blast , I towed the animal ship out of target zero . The outside world never had a true account of that test . What are you trying to say , John ? Coyote . In the daytime . Hm . Must be a lot of game in this valley now . Contaminated game . Fighting for life , just the way we are . What 's the matter , Granger ? There 's live game outside . I can tell . Yes , we heard a coyote during the day . I can feel it . And I need meat . Granger , that game 's contaminated . If you ate that , you 'd die . You would die , but not me . I can 't eat that canned junk . I 've gotta have some meat ! Fresh , do you hear ? That 's all you 're gonna get for a long time . That 's what you think . That 's just what you think . Three weeks . Thought we 'd all be dead by now . Even Granger got out of bed yesterday . Steve ... - I know he 's your brother , but - - But what ? Well , he - he gives me a funny feeling . Logically , he should have been dead long ago , but ... There 's no such thing as logic anymore . What 's so illogical about my brother ? You know as well as I do , he hasn 't taken food or water in three weeks . Not since he 's been here . He says he doesn 't need food . And last night , he slipped out of the house and didn 't come back until dawn . The radiation must have affected his mind . He 's a mutation , Steve . Face it . He 's a freak of this new atomic world of ours . I 'm going outside . For a walk . Well , uh , don 't go too far . Stay inside of the house . Why ? Because I say so , that 's why . - Aren 't you tired , Grange ? You need more sleep . - I 'm not tired . I 'm not afraid of anything out there . In fact , I like it . Would you like to go with me ? Oh , no , I have things to do . I think he 's dangerous . No , I don 't think so . He should be destroyed . Destroyed ? My brother ? Yes . For our safety . You can 't do that , John ! Well , not just because he 's my brother , but don 't you see ... it 's important to us that he live . I don 't see why . I 'm not sure yet . We have to study him . If it doesn 't rain in the next few weeks , I think we 're gonna live . Somehow I knew we wouldn 't die . My father always seemed so positive . You know , after the bombs came , I didn 't much care if I lived or died . Don 't talk like that . It 's true , Joanna . But these past few weeks with you ... Now I feel I 've got a big reason to live . Me too , Steve . Joanna - What 's wrong ? Did I misunderstand ? Didn 't you hear it ? Hear what ? Something out there - That strange feeling , sound , something - Stronger than the last time I felt it ! It 's just some harmless animal in the bushes , that 's all . No , Steve ! It 's more ! Let 's go back in the house . Please . These bones are still moist ! Look at the footprints ! They 're Granger 's . You think he ate that rabbit ? He must have . He spends most of his nights prowling around in these woods . 49 Renchens . You think a man could eat that poisoned meat and live ? No . No human could . It defies all the laws of man and God . There may be a new set of laws , John . Laws for post-nuclear life we know nothing about . Out with it , Steve . Say what you mean . Well , I 'm only guessing , but - We know that even small amounts of radiation can produce change . Now if , for some reason , a man could survive complete saturation , a thousand generations of change could take place in a matter of weeks . The Matsuo test . What do you mean ? Nothing . Go on with your theory . I 'm afraid there are more Grangers out here . And even worse than him . All of us have survived more cumulative exposure than we ever thought possible . You mean we all might become like your brother ? Stalking these woods at night ? Eating raw meat ? It 's possible . - Any bright theories as to what to do in this situation ? - No . You know , when my brother couldn 't find the answer to something , he looked it up in the Bible . He believed that it held the answers to everything . " For I am with thee to save thee and deliver thee , sayeth the Lord . " " I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked . " " I will redeem thee out of the land of the terrible . " Look , I had enough of that Bible when I was a kid . Well , it 's easy to see it had no effect on you , Mickey . I 'm gonna go look for Granger . What was that ? Maybe you 'd better tell us what the Bible says about rain . In our situation , we 'd better pray that it doesn 't rain . Not for weeks , anyway . Because if it does rain in this valley , it 'll be coming down through clouds saturated with nuclear death . Maybe we 'll be safe , like Noah and the Ark . Right now , there 's about 40 Renchens of activity in this room . If it rains , that will move up into the hundreds of Renchens in a matter of hours . And we 'll all be dead . Or , like Granger . If we 're unlucky . But , maybe the updrafts from the lake will hold the clouds back . They will , Dad . We 've been lucky so far . We 're gonna live . I just feel it . I hope you 're right , sweetheart . And if the weather does clear , starting tomorrow , we 'll have to go on half rations . How much is half of nothing ? I 've stored some seeds and grain . And I have books and materials on every craft necessary to sustain life . Mickey Brown : farmer and craftsman . Oh , another thing - We 're about out of fresh water . But there 's a spring-fed pool not so far from the cliffs . Hey , Joanna - maybe we could take a swim in the pool . Well , if Dad says it 's all right . Oh , it 's safe . I checked it today . And starting tomorrow , we can all take turns bathing there . Well , I 'm telling you one thing . I 've taken more baths in the past two months than I have in all my born days together . Maybe that 's why you 're still alive , Tim . - Grange ? - Don 't let it touch me ! - Don 't let the rain touch me ! - It 's OK , Grange , the clouds aren 't gonna come in the valley ! You 're lying to me ! It 's gonna rain ! Come on . Come on . Come on back to the house . Gonna touch me ! Grange , come on back to the house ! - This place is spooky even in sunshine . - It feels great , though . So quiet . I 'd give anything to hear that downtown traffic again . I didn 't realize how isolated it would be from the house . You are good looking . Clean-cut , and that bit . That 's something new for Mickey . Mickey ? Oh , he 's all eyes for you . He isn 't even giving me the time of day anymore . I 'm not interested in Mickey . Well , you 'd better not be . Otherwise , well ... I 'd have to make a play for Steve ! That would be unfair competition for you . Yes , I ... I see what you mean . Mickey always comes back to mama . Hey , what 's the matter , kid ? Somebody 's watching us , I can feel it ! I didn 't hear anything ! Something 's moving over there in the bushes ! It 's probably one of the fellas . It 's probably old Timothy . Hey , Timothy ! Hurry up . Let 's get out of here ! Granger 's not the only one hunting game . And , after they 've finished off the game , we 'll be next ! This place is cursed . Steve , we 've got to get rid of your brother . John ! He 's the only way to find out what we 're up against ! Don 't you see that ? The animals on the ship . The Matsuo test . They forewarned of something like this . - You know , you keep mentioning that . You gonna keep up the mystery , or you gonna tell me about it ? - Tonight . Back at the house , I 'll show you , after the others have gone to bed . I have the evidence . What you looking at ? You said I didn 't see anything at the pool . You said it was just my imagination . That 's right . You just became upset . Steve , somebody was looking at me , tried to talk to me . What 'd he say ? Nothing you 'd understand . Nothing I 'd understand , for that matter . Well , you won 't go swimming alone in the pool anymore . I 'll stand guard . My skin was tingling , my pulse was pounding ... You 're still upset . Come on , let 's go back to the house . Do you believe in mental telepathy ? I 'm afraid I 'm reading your thoughts , if that 's what you mean . What am I thinking ? It 's not the same way you were thinking about me a few days ago . I 'm sorry , Steve . I just feel like I 'd like to be alone right now . I 'm sorry too , Joanna . Mickey ! Don 't scare me like that . I just wanna talk to you , that 's all . You know , I bet I haven 't said a dozen words to you since I got here . Hey , look , what 's so bad about me ? I don 't drink , I don 't smoke ... And once I even gave some money to a drunken bum . My old man ! Come on . Don 't give me that hard-to-get stuff - come on ! Don 't ! You belong to Jada . I belong to me ! Get it ? Me ! Hey buddy ! Oh , it 's you , Miss Jada . Care for a taste of some of the best whiskey in these mountains ? It is whiskey ! Hey , where 'd you get it ? Made it myself , that 's where . I make it by the barrels back at my place . That is awful , Tim ! The first taste is never good , Miss Jada . It 's that long , second one that puts hair on your chest ! Better ? Grange ! You won 't believe this , but I just saw Granger walk up the mountain trail through that fog , and it didn 't faze him . Do you remember anything about the Matsuo bomb test ? Yeah , there were some vague rumors right after that , weren 't there ? There 's something I have to show you . As I told you , my job was to tow the animal ship out of Target Zero . I got the first look at those animals . - The newspapers said they were all destroyed . - The newspapers lied . Three of those animals lived through it . Lived through an H-bomb ? There was a law against taking photographs . But no law against sketching what we 'd seen . There were over a thousand animals on that ship . - That was a chipmunk . - This was alive ? Yes . It lived for three days . Our third survivor was a monkey . Its skin looked like rubber , but it felt more like metal . Armor-plated . Nature 's answer to complete nuclear radiation . Why , that 's a million years of evolution with one bomb ! - You say they lived for three days ? - When we got back to the inspection ship , they were dead . - Well , if we could figure out what killed them , it may help us . - We never knew . After we washed them down , we went down to inspect . They were normal , except for their appearance . But they refused food and water . - New species . - Yes . They were the forerunners of whatever it is we have out there . Sometimes I have a feeling of doom . Well , I know this much : There are two forms of life fighting for survival in this valley , and only one can win . John , it 's got to be us . You know , I started this thing just to stay alive . But you 've given me a deep feeling of responsibility toward the welfare of mankind . Our kind . I think I 'll turn in now . Goodnight , John . Yes . I 'll tell the girls the first thing in the morning . - The girls ? - Yes . They should bear children as soon as possible . Steve ! That 's enough ! Now , Mickey - we 've had enough of you . Get your things and get out of this house ! You wouldn 't do that to an animal , Dad . - He stays . - Are you all right , love ? Get out of my life ! Mickey ! A sea captain can perform the marriage ceremony in case of an emergency . Joanna , I want you to marry Steve . I want you to have ... children . There 'll be no wedding , Dad , and no children . You have a responsibility to the future . - What would Mother say ? - Your mother ? - And Larry , what would he say ? They 're both dead . I 'm the only one who knows . Knows ? Knows what ? - Have you been listening to me ? - Yes , Dad . I 'll marry Steve in a week . If he 's still alive . And I am . What are you doing , love ? This little gadget 's gonna open that storeroom for me . Can you imagine us having a kid ? 'Course , we won 't tell him his mother was a - exotic dancer . I wonder what 's wrong with Joanna ? She goes around in her own little world now . She slipped off her rocker . - Maybe we all are . - Not me , baby . You still go for her , don 't you ? You 're just plain dirt to her , but you still want her ! All I want is a key to open that storeroom ! All this time you 've been saying it was you and me ! But you meant her ! You liar ! OK , OK . So I lied a little . A little ! The only friend you ever had in this world was me ! The only one who ever loved you was me ! Me , me ! Now listen , you cheap hood ! A present from the hood ... lover ! Now beat it ! I wanna finish this key . We can 't go up there for at least two more months . And we 're running out of supplies . Only enough for about two more weeks . Don 't touch him - he 's hot . Food . They wouldn 't give me any . " They ? " There 's more of you up there ? Stronger ... - Much ... stronger . - How many ? How many more ? Uhh ... stronger ... uuhh ... Food ! He won 't be needing food now , poor devil . Look at the head . The strange bone structure . It 's like those animals at Matsuo . And the same mutated skin the animals had . And ... there 's more like him up there ! Stronger ! Stage 2 , this one . Stage 3 , stronger . Stage 4 , maybe invulnerable . How about Stage 1 ? Who 's that ? That 's Granger . My brother is Stage 1 . There 's no doubt about it . They 're coming closer to the house every night . We 'll have to take turns standing guard , Steve . I 'd use Mickey , but we can 't trust him with a gun in his hand . I know his kind - spawned in bilgewater . Timothy , sometimes you 're a lifesaver . Jada , we 're like two peas in a pod . Sometimes , we 're feelin ' low as a have-no-well , - but give us a whack of this stuff - - Yeah ! Give us a whack of this ! ... and we 're high as a silk hat on Sunday ! Come on , ya big lug ! Hey ... quit it ! Quit pouring so fast ! Come with Jada , Timothy baby ! I wanna pay you back for all that ever-lovin ' kindness ! Request permission to come aboard , Captain ! Permission granted , sailor . And when I come out , they start to whistle and shout " Take it off ! " And once I got my motor running , all you could hear was their breathing ! That near scared me to death ! One time , I , like , ran off stage ! But Mickey baby , he just kicked my little backside and - ! On I went ! Now wasn 't that sweet of Mickey baby ? One of these days I 'm gonna return that favor . Now , here it comes ! This is where I start to peel ! Kick me under that blue spot , daddy , ' cause I 'm comin ' on for the clincher ! N-no ! Don 't break my jug , please ! That was the last drop I had ! Good ! Then we 'll have no more of this disgusting behavior . Right ? " Sailor " ? There 's one like you in every crowd ! Now I 'll never make it ! But I , uh ... Well ? What have you got to say about it ? Personally , I hate the stuff . Have a nice nap ? Caught me . I must have dozed off . Say , have you seen Tim ? He 's not in the house anyplace . He 's probably sleeping it off in the woods somewhere . You know , I 'm really worried about that old coot . You shouldn 't have broken his jug . You 're right . I had no idea he was an alcoholic . Well , if he doesn 't show up by daybreak , I 'll go out and find him . I 'll go with you . It was my mistake . You don 't suppose he tried to get back up over those cliffs , do you ? Well , he better not . If he does , it 'll be the end of him . Goodnight . Easy , Timothy ... It 's ... just a little rabbit . My god ! Tim ! Tim , don 't ! Don 't go into that fog ! Don 't go into that fog ! You 'll be killed sure ! John ! Steve ! - What happened ? - Oh , I 've sprained my ankle . - Where 's Tim ? - Back up over the cliff . He went back to his whiskey still . Did you go after him ? Through that vapor ? How long were you up there ? A minute . Hour . What difference does it make ? Steve , I 've had the course . Well , come on . We 'll get you washed up . Don 't tell Joanna . I 've just got a sprained ankle , understand ? Sure , John . Come on . Let 's get back to the house . He 's dead . Believe me , Steve , it 's better this way . Poor Granger . Now my whole family 's gone . No , Steve . You and Joanna are the new family now . Perhaps for the whole human race . Look at those punctures ! It 's like - like three steel claws ! Steel claws ... It 's like the hand of the monkey in your drawings ! Matsuo . - Steve ! - What is it , Joanna ? - In there ! In the bushes ! - Where ? What is it ? Someone was calling to me ! It 's just your imagination ! I wasn 't 40 feet away from you and I didn 't hear a thing ! Oh , please , Steve , take me home ! Please ! Joanna insists this thing tried to talk to her . How about the way it looked ? She said it looked like an ape . The sketches of Matsuo . The monkey ! But this thing is man-sized . That means it 's a man , not an ape . How do we fight it ? How do we kill it ? You 're the one who said we 'd come up with an answer . But how ? It eats contaminated flesh , breathes contaminated air ... The things that kill a man , it thrives on . What 's the point ? You 're driving at something . Just that in order to kill it , we must first understand it . Now , we know it has fears . It was close enough to Joanna to attack her , but it wouldn 't follow her into the pool . Don 't scream . I mean it ! What do you want ? I never had time for your kind of woman . You 're something new in my life . No ... No ! Girl , you won 't hate me when there 's just the two of us - there 'd be no point to it , get what I mean ? Mickey ! Let the kid alone ! Joanna , go back to the house . I have a few words for this child molester here ! You don 't know when you 're through , do ya ? You said the two of us , - but all along , you meant her ! - Yeah , that 's right . Now you know . You and your dimestore stuff . You 're cheap ! A cheapie ! I didn 't know how cheap you are ' til I met her ! She hates your guts ! You 're cheap to her ! She 'd rather kill herself first ! Come on . Let 's not fight like a couple of kids . - Let 's go take a moonlight swim , huh ? - Beat it ! I don 't want any part of you . Well . You decided to come back to Jada . What 's the gun for , Cap 'n ? Where 's Jada ? Well , we had a little beef . She didn 't come back . Stayed outside to cool off , I guess . OK , Mickey . I got something to settle with you . Tomorrow , maybe . I 'm beat right now . - You go next to Joanna again and I 'm gonna kill you . - Kill me ! I haven 't had a laugh all day . Why he was spared by the bombs , I 'll never know . He 'll kill you , Steve . Get him first . Now ! Here , take this ! Just sneak up on Mickey and empty it into him , huh ? John , you know me better than that . It 's the same feeling that made you go up that mountain for Tim . But there 's so much at stake . At least carry a gun . Here , get one . Out of the storeroom . Get it now . And be ready to use it . Hey , how long before a guy can get out of here ? As far as I 'm concerned , you can leave now . You know , this reminds me of that kids ' song . Ten Little Indians . ... That got knocked off one at a time . Same way with us . First there were seven . Now there 's ... Now there 's ... " 3 little 2 little 1 little Indians ... " And then there was none . Try that again . Please . Try that again . Not me , Cap 'n . I know when to cool it . Like right now . Joanna ! Joanna ! - I heard her screaming , but she 's not in her room ! - I have a strange feeling . She 's in danger , Steve . That thing ... - The thing out there has got my baby ! - I 'm going after her . - Wait ! There 's a special Luger . In the storeroom . With a 30-round magazine . Get it . Steve - put your revolver under my pillow . You won 't need it . If there 's no other way , use that Luger on Joanna . Joanna ! Now ! That 's better , Cap 'n . If there 's two men and only one gun , I like to have it . Looks like your ship 's falling apart , don 't it ? Well , you 've been no help . You wouldn 't find Jada . You wouldn 't help Steve look for Joanna . Oh , you 're lower than scum . I 'm a coward . I only fight when I have to . And on my own conditions . And one of ' em is that I know what I 'm fighting . Joanna ! " 3 little 2 little 1 little Indian ... " You know , you 're a sucker . I know you went after ol ' Tim , into that fog . Killed yourself for that worthless old coot . So , that 's why you 're acting so brave . - That 's why you 're moving in . - Moving in ? I 'm taking over . The works , the house . Your daughter . If she gets back . I 'd make a better old man for her kids than Steve would . They 'd be tough , like me . Looks like it will rain after all . Still think that rain will kill us all ? You 'll know soon enough . Joanna ! Here , Steve ! Over here ! The water ! It 's afraid of the water ! Well , there 's your rain , Cap 'n ! But good ! How long do you think we 'll live now ? Well , here . Get me a sample of the rainwater and I 'll test it . Why , it doesn 't register ! That 's pure water ! Well , what do you know . Just plain old rainwater ! That 's it ! Water ! It 's afraid of water ! Joanna and Steve may be safe ! What 's afraid , Cap 'n ? - You crackin ' up on me ? - Don 't you see , you idiot ? That thing out there , that atomic fiend . It 's afraid of pure water . That 's why it wouldn 't go in the pool ! What are you thinking in that sick mind of yours ? Simple . I 'm gonna shoot Steve , right between the eyes . In God 's name , why ? Well , I thought you knew , smart man . I want Joanna . I don 't hear it anymore . Hear what ? The weird sound . It tried to speak to me . Steve ? It was Larry . What killed him ? He was created to live in a contaminated atmosphere . Guess the rain must be pure . He couldn 't stand it . I guess that means that all the other people like Larry will be killed by the rain , too . Then there is a future . Yes , Joanna . Mickey ! The Beginning

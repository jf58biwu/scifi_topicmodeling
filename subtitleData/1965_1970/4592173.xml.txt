 ANDROMEDA NEBULA adapted from a novel by Ivan YEFREMOV You , the elders , accept my skill and desire ! Accept my labor , and teach me through the day and the night ! Extend a hand of guidance , since the way is difficult ! And I will follow you ! You , the elders , accept my skill and desire ! Accept my labor ... - Good day , Mven Mas ! - A , Junius ! Good day ! - Do you take part in the celebration ? - I am sent by the Council of Astro Navigation . We looked the entire day for you throughout the whole planet , and here you are . The is a time of Herculean effort . This young man selected me to be his teacher . Mven , I am not alone , there are members of Council . They would like to talk with you . They are there , on helicopter pad . Well . I will be right back . The Council wants you , Mven , to accept the post of the manager of the external stations of Great Ring . - But Dar Veter ? - He is retiring . Must I answer now ? Tomorrow is next reception from the Great Ring , it 's good opportunity for the change . I am going to the observatory today , I only have to finish ceremony here . Well , we know , mentor-teacher . Yeh , I will be busyer now , but we all have entered adulthood . My teacher was Erg Noor . By the way , are there any news about " Tantra " ? The program of 37th Star Expedition is completed . " Al 'Graab " with anameson went towards " Tantra " . And if encounter took place ... Sreenplay by Dmitriyevskiy , Sherstobitov Directed by Yevgeny Sherstobitov Production designer Aleksey Bobrovnikov Music by Yakov Lapinskiy Sound engineer Nikolai Trakhtenberg The field stress is twice as high as calculated . - We must reduce our speed . - You mean , decellerate ? But how then accelerate our flight ? We will lack anameson ! Make a decision , Pel ! The Commander will be awake in only three hours ! Switch on planetary engines ! Ingrid ! What a swift growth of gravity ! What is there in front ? Just darkness ! Only darkness ! But , here there 's nothing , here there can 't be anything ! This region has has not been explored , Pel . Switch front screens to the infrared ! Stop engines ! What a fool I am ! I was convinced that we are near the dark cloud ! But this ... Yes , this is an iron star ! Congratulations , Pel ! You discovered it in place , where no one suspected its existence ! If we had only caught earlier ! Now we can 't escape from its gravitational pull ! Awake ! Wake up the entire crew immediately ! - Good day ! - Good day ! - Good day ! - Good day ! I still don 't understand his decision . Couldn 't the Council really convince him ? Is there a rule , to persuade man to do what he does not want to do ? Yes , but Dar Veter has for six years led the external stations . Preventive throughout entire Earth ! Power plants , all factories , net transport and radio stations ! Good day , Veter ! Well , is it all decided ? Decided ! I am glad , Veter . You should rest . It is , probably hard to understand . It is hard until you experience something similar yourself . The manner , the manner , by which you lived ... which is given by society ... this way suddenly becomes , for you , not so important . Not only ... Veter , do you have time ? Are you free now ? I will come to you ! Wait ! - You are too unforgiving of yourself . - Unforgiving ? But if you can object , ignore what others say , don 't note , that you begin to believe only to yourself ... No , at whatever position you will find this illness , it is necessary to immediately change the work . Doctors say that . I say it myself , doctors only confirm it . Veda ! Stop it , Veter ! " Tantra " did not return yet . But I love you ! You forgot , Veter ! There is Erg Noor . Do you still love him ? No , I do not love . Then you are free . What holds you back ? What ? I am convinced , convinced that each of you ... will worthily meet all tests , that may befall our path . As an astronaut . As an citizen of Earth . I was able to deflect the spaceship , and we will not crash into the iron star . But it will be impossible for us to escape from its gravitational pull . An encounter with " Al 'Graab " did not take place , and entire anameson was spent to the braking . We are now captive to this star . I do not ask your for advice , I already made a decision . This star has two planets . We will orbit one of them , gather signal flare , send it to the Earth and await rescue . And it will be a long wait . Pour Khiss ! At least approximately , how long ? Twenty , twenty five years ... Not too long ! When we return , I will be only 50 years old ! And I only 75 ! Crew , take you places ! We pass to the orbital flight . Niza ! You are in space for the first time . - 20 years , is this terrible for you ? - But what about You ? - I was born in space , on board of a spaceship . - I didn 't know . And my first children 's impressions were - blackness of space , the myriads of stars and the panels of starship . But you changed the subject , you didn 't answer me . 20 years , this is clearly terrible . - But I am glad ! - How so ? In any case , these 20 yers next to you will be me . But not her . Good day ! Am I too late ? - Veda Kong . - I have heard a lot about you ! And I about you . After we receive information from epsilon of Toucan she will read a lecture about our history for the planet of the system of star Canopus . It 's time ! - System check ready ! - Confirmed . - Countdown ready ! - Confirmed . - Ignition engaged ! - Confirmed . Satellite 57 greets you , earthlings ! The Earth greets you , satellite ! Kour Ghan , this is Mven Mas , look to him with attention ! - From now you will work with him . - Here everything is ready , waiting for epsilon of Toucan . They apparently are attempting to make the contact with any civilization . Well , Kour Ghan , take command ! Attention ! It 's time , Mven , to take the forces of the planet into your hands ! Forward , to the challenge ! Forward , to the challenge ! Mountains ! Just like the Pamir . The height not more than 2000-3000 meters . I can only imagine , what color is water ! - Outlines ... - Then what is this ? Large meteorite . - Or ... - Ship ! - Spaceship ! Rocket ! - Rocket ? Fantasy ! Here , far off the standard routes , in the edge of the galaxy ? I don 't think they have there planets with the highest forms of life . They are lonely . Yes , they are lonely , as we were lonely , we earthlings . Until we deccoded the language of the Great Ring and entered the brotherhood of reason . Do they really know nothing about the Great Ring ? Probably , by now , they already know . What we see now , occurred 300 years ago . 300 years ! 88 parsecs from here ! All , who we see now , are already dead long ago . 88 parsecs ! 88 ... That 's all . His position is unstable , but it is fixed and now signal is gathered . Make sure that today entire planet knows about this . And prepare information for the members of the Ring ! - I am disconnecting , Veter ! - Ask him , he is the chief now . How long will the lecture go to Canopus ? 100 - 120 years . And they will see me living ! What a monstrous contradiction between the might of man , his reason , and his unimpotance in time and the space . And mankind is so far unable to overcome and to compress time . You have 10 minutes more . Will you remain here or you come with me ? I 'll stay here . She is excellent . And amazingly human-like . Yes . She is amazing . For the first time in 800 years of existence of Great Ring we not only saw a planet with intelligent life , but also with human-like appearance . So , I have reasons , why I do not love space with its emptiness and monstrous distances . They are now there , and if something happens , either I or entire humanity have any powers to help . - Excuse me , Commander . - Something happened ? The second orbit begins . Yes , I know . She is beautiful . Beautiful . But she does not love you . I saw , how she accompanied you . As a friend , as a person , one who risks all , but not as a loved one . This portrait , it supports you in hard times , it strengthens faith , gives power , but it does not call back to the Earth . Right ? Central station speaking . Commander , this is the spaceship ! We had time to take a picture . Alien ! You do understand ? Alien ! What happened , Mven ? Why this urgency ? Did you hear about my new work ? Not only heard , but also saw in the last news the formal announcement . Ren , here is why I called you here . See ! See ! There is the star epsilon of Toucan , and there the star 61 Cygnus , and further is Albireo . Three stars ! And there , and there , and there is life ! I know , Ren , I saw ! There pulses thought , intelligent life lives there . But they are monstrously far apart . Ren , I know , in you academy you deal with space . Yes , with space as a function of the time . Let 's join our projects together , Ren . I want to compress time . And then to see livingbeings and to speak with living beings . You are theorist , Ren , tell me , is this possible ? It seems , that I am close to the solution . But my conclusions need verification . And verification needs to be experimental . I am glad that you understood me . You and I are just grit in this boundless space . But today , right now , we create a challenge ! The spaceship does not respond to our signals . Sixteenth orbit . The noise of planetary engines one cannot fail to hear ! Disc spaceships are unknown in nearby regions ! I am convinced - this is an alien in trouble ! What does crew recommend ? We are in trouble too ! But they clearly need our help ! As if we do not need help ! Eighteenth orbit . They do not hear us ! Or do not undersand . We have to land , Commander ! - That 's last of our fuel ! - Yes , the last ! We will no longer be able to take off . And we will not be able to send a signal flare ? Yes , we will not be able to send rocket ! We are just considering ! We are in uncertain ! There , below , are the messengers from another world ! Crew , remain at your places ! We go to the lower layers of the atmosphere for landing ! Switch on the warning signals ! Crew Personnel Station : Good morning ! Good morning ! The place in the underwater titanium mines on the coast of South America is free . But it is necessary to go quickly ! Excuse me , I forgot to inform you , I already selected a place . I am just gathering the my stuff . I am going to the archaelogical expedition . No problem ! I just wanted to carry out your request more precisely . We will find enough people to this place . Living Quarters Assignment Station : good morning ! - Good morning ! I am leaving . Sector 6 , 385 691 . Accepted . Finally ! I started thinking , that I arrived too early . Well , Veter , everything is already done . - Now you are my subordinated . - I obey , my chief ! They are dead . And long ago . Another victim of space . I understand , catastrophes are inevitable , but to see it ... Eon , the surface vehicle is ready . Surface vehicle is ready . Excellent , Kay , let 's go . Emergency group to the vehicle ! Ranking officer aboard the ship is Kay Bear . - Pel ! What about your planet ? - Why is it " my " planet ? But whose is it ? Who discovered the iron star ? A planet is like a planet . It is possible to live ! They could also not take off ! Just like us ! They broke free from the grips of the iron star 's gravity . It 's a trap-planet . They warn on the Great Ring about them . The legends are based on them . How many millenia was it on the way ? Why ? What is missing there , in his home ? The same what us , Kim , knowledge , brotherhood . - Commander , I will go around it to the left . - And I to the right . May be we are too careless , Erg ? Strange planet , strange life . A-a-a ... Eon , Niza , stop ! Stop ! Back ! Pel , here ! Back ! Hold them in light ! Back ! Eon , Niza ! Do not stray from the light ! All move away behind the vehicle ! Hold the light ! - What happened to Kim ? - Why are you silent ? What about Kim ? Erg , answer ! I have heard these markings on many planets . The best children of the Earth remained here to warn those who follow . Our boy ! Erg , you do not know . He emulated you in everything , he trained his will excessively . Only I answer for all that happened ! But there is no sense to speak of it , only on the Earth . On The Earth ? Commander still does believe in this possibility ? I believe thus far I live . We will send signal flare . But fuel ? Let 's attempt to explore this strange spaceship . It is possible that there is some form of energy . You forget , Commander , out of the ship we are powerless an unarmed . Light ! Commander was first who notice this ! The killer is the creature of gloom , and he must fear light ! Back ! All move away behind vehicle ! Lower you helmet visors ! Be careful ! Shield your eyes ! Shield your eyes ! Send next , Kei ! We will change only settings . Erg , may be enough ? Calm down ! We must break in ! Don 't waste time , Kei ! Commander ! He do not let us in ! We have to leave . Foolishness ! We just break in blindly . But forsaking of attempts is forsaking of life , rocket , and finally of escape . - May be we 'll continue tomorrow ? - Or may be after month or half a year ? We have enough time . We really have enough time . But irritation and impatience are bad advisers , Commander . Pur Hiss , you said it ? Agree . Let 's continue tomorrow . This way we do not achieve success . Attempt after attempt , but result is zero . - We just do not have robots . - But there must be some key ! - It is inside the spaceship . - Take your time , Erg ! What did we , when we landed here ? Right ! We have to look for tracks of this spaceship owners ! What 's there ? - Metallic object . - 20 degrees to the left . Kay , we go forward . - But you will leave the light of " Tantra " ! - We will go ! - Surface vehicle from the terrestrial spaceship ! - What vehicle ? What spaceship ? I cannot follow you by light ! Erg , where are you ? We 'll go ahead ! " Tantra " ! We found a surface vehicle . There are no people . Kay , we go forward . Raise searchlights . Try to accompany us . In the last ten years not a single first class spaceship has left the Earth . Yes , but 15 years ago started 36th Star Expedition . - And one ship did not return . - Do you think , this is the " Sail " ? It is the " Sail " ! Earth spaceship of the first class . The twin of our " Tantra " . Do you no longer like our work ? I am complacent , I am calm , as if they treat me by blue sky dreams . Yes , of course . After so many years of life in space ... our work seems small and dull . In my opinion , in the past centuries they already explored everywhere , the entire planet . It was always so . Some look to the future , others investigate in the past . The same will be after we gone , Veter . I just talked with Mven Mas . The set time passed , but " Tantra " is still silent . Something happened , Veter ! We know so little about space . Actually , we are trampling down on our small scrap of space . Kay , Lin ! Pay close attention ! Always keep us in the light ! Somewhere there must be an emergency light terminal . That would be nice . Great ! It works ! Enter ! The fourth . - Ingrid , Kay , do you copy us ? - Yes , we do , Commander . - All is OK , Erg ! - We are going inside ! Eon will inspect forward holds , Niza and me the central station . Pel and Lin inspect the rear decks . Pel , anameson is most important ! Niza , look for flight logs first ! Commander ! Erg ! Do you copy me ? Yes , very well , Eon ! That means , that onboard radio equipment is working ! Attention ! Central station speaking ! - Pel , do you copy ? - I do , Commander . Dust . Soot . Nothing suspicious . Nothing supernatural . Only two marks of unknown origin , on the floor and on the wall . Here the same . In the corridor there is a strange spot near the chamber 016 . Just on the door , the size of a human torso . - Did you enter the chamber ? - Yes , I did . Why do you keep silent ? Perhaps I did not say ? There is anameson . Four containers . Four ! " Tantra " ! Friends ! Do you hear ? My dears , we are saved ! May be someone will finally turn off this damned noise ? Commander ! The flight logs ! Today , 12th of 7th month of 323th year of Ring , we all , who were survived , finished preparation ofa rocket-transmitter . Tomorrow we will send that calculated I switch on more more ... Something happened ! What happened ? That , that they collected ... Two were rescued . Blanca did not jump so far ... elevator ... We could not close the doors , only second one . Mechanics reached the engines . He struck by planetary ... They , besides fury and horror , nothing . Yes , nothing ... Seems that Kton also did not reach . I am alone . I am alone . But I survived ! Before I begin ... Brothers , if you find " Sail " , I warn , never leave your ship . I have to investigate about Kton . I will explain in detail when I return . Where is the music ? Where is the song ? According to tradition of our astronauts , let 's honor our dead comrades . Dear friends ! Thanks to you ! We promise to return , and report your discovery to humanity , convey your love to the Earth . I do not understand your indecision , Erg . It 's like you are waiting for something . We finish loading anameson in 12 hours , and then we will be able to take off . Yes , Kay , as a commander , I am ready to give the command . But as a scientist ... We met here something unknown , and this unknown kills . We are scouts , Kay . After us others will arrive . Tragedy of " Sail " can not be repeated . Does it mean , that launch is postponed ? Yes . We must meet those unknown face to face . Eon is preparing one experiment . I have to feel and to see this myself . " Tantra " , kill the searchlight ! Eon , lights off ! Well , well , now we need patience . Look , Niza , this time you were able to convince Eon , but from tomorrow I forbid you participation in all actions outside the ship . But Commander , according to the schedule I am in the emergency group . I am not joking ! Are you afraid , that I am close to you ? But nevertheless I will be close . Close to you - here , now , then ... on this planet , on the Earth ... Entire life . I love you , Commander . And I can 't go anywhere from this love . Niza ! Wel , well . I will be silent . Just accept it . These are the verses of very ancient poet . Accept it for the memory ! A printed book ? What old times ! Now ! Do you sense it ? A pain in your spine ? I sense it too . Attention ! " Tantra " ! Kay , are you ready ? Attention ! Light ! Well , what was this ? - I had 't time to observe . - Me either . Something like feelers . May be these are shadows , the clusters of darkness around the discharges of some energy ? No , no , it is clearly living creature . And it tried to devour us . The monster has striking reaction . No wonder those who were killed had no time to report . Recreating of this is unpleasant , but we need to repeat our experiment . Kay , turn the light off ! The creature is not alone ! I think , one ought not let him to touch the car . You are right . " Tantra " , get ready ! Let 's each looks only to his side ! Kay ! I Have never seen something like this ! I 'll never forget it until the day I die ! Erg ! We have to seriously study these jellyfishes ! Jellyfishes and spiral-disc ! Are we scientists or not ? We can 't miss this opportunity to learn , from where it is , who constructed them , what they carried to other places ? That 's why I propose planetary engines . Use of a planetary engine , is , of course , a good idea . But how ... It is decided . Only men will go . As in the good old times . - But Louma ? - Louma is a doctor . I am a doctor too ! You are , first of all , astro-navigator , Niza , and you must be at your place . Well ! Well , I will be at my place . Louma ! I must be tomorrow with him and the next ! Ridiculous ! There will all be next to him there . Is it really so hard to understand ? You all ! But it must be , first of all , me ! Me ! No one can be too close , no one ! Niza ? Louma does not feel well , she requested replacement . When they request , it cannot be refused . We will clear it up aboard the ship . By the way , Kay ... Commander , where are you going ? Erg ! Erg ! Erg ! Erg ! Retreat ! Everyone ! Everyone stay back ! " Tanta " , hold the light ! Retreat ! It is enough victims ! We are not ready for this fight . Retreat ! - She is alive , but ... - Is she dying ? Not yet . The heart works , one beat in one hundred seconds . This is not death , but still a complete collapse . Consciousness , pain ? Excluded . Absolutely . If collapse will not progress , it 's all the same . Let she will sleep until the Earth . I fear hovewer , if her heart will overload on takeoff . What do you propose ? We 'll prepare a special chamber . And then insert her in a floating medical box . Agreed . As soon as you 're done , report back to the post . We will stay here no longer than necessary . Taht 's enough of the darkness and gravity of this black world . " For thy sweet love remember 'd such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings ' . " Everything is ready , Commander . We can start . Just a moment , Kay . There are Louma , Eon ... They must do something . What an ancient melody ! This is the melody of my distant ancestors . They lived here . They lived , they grazed cattle , they ploughed , loved ... Veter , I do not ask , I am somehow sure . You will not leave expedition , you will not leave me . We will move to the sea soon , and you are certainly free to select any work , but ... my friends like you . Veda ! We are not children . When can we speak seriously ? Only when " Tantra " comes back . So I did not answer you . I thought , we will have time there on the Earth . Do you see ... you do hear anything in your sleep ? Do you remember me ? Erg ! She does not hear ! She cannot hear anything ! You told me , I am afraid to be close . Now I am next to you , and I do not fear . You have to rest . Pull yourself together , Commander ! Erg ! How long are we been with already in space ? We saw much , even death , severe and absurd . You can 't , you do not have a right to weaken yourself ! - Erg ! - What else ? I must say that modern neurology has mapped the emergence of emotions . I want to say that medicine can manage their existence to act on those cerebral core , to suppress distressful experiences . And I could ... Do you propose ... to supress my love in orded to free me from the suffering ? Man must not suffer , Erg ! Suffering deprives you of reason ! But the crew needs you reason ! She is right , Erg ! She is right , Erg , right ! Yes , I agree . Am I late ? No , no . Please . What 's wrong , Erg ? Be careful ! Commander ! Erg ! Erg , what 's wrong ? Erg , do you feel okay ? Here ! Here ! " That then I scorn to change my state with kings ' . " Erg ! You did not understand at all ! No , Louma , no ! I will not give up my feelings , even if they force me to suffer . Suffering , if it not too intense , conducts to the understanding , understanding to the love . So it is a locked circle . Wou were good to me , thanks . But there will be no second session , Louma ! You , the elders , who call me to the way of labor ! Aaccept my skill and desire , accept my labor , and teach me in daylight and at night ! Lend me a guiding hand , since the way is difficult ! And I will follow you ! You are changed , Veter ! Earlier , when you commanded entire energy of Earth , spoke with the distant worlds ... Was I so different ? You started to smile more , to be glad about the simplest , the most usual things . You are greatly changed , Veter ! Mven Mas ? Is he looking for you ? Yes , we arranged a meeting here . He flew in from Tibet . With Ren Boze they are preparing an immense experiment . Ah , this is surely connected with his dream about compressing time ? Obviously . And he needs me right here , at the ceremony . That is Mven Mas . - Excuse me . - Of course . Everything has been provided by you . Now the most serious matter remains , the danger of work . What scientist is afraid of risk ? I did not talk about the personal , Mven . But experiment will include the external stations of Great Ring . Do we have the right to risk the greatest achievement of humanity , a window to the cosmos ? I see billions of past human lives ! Where instantly , as sand between the fingers , ran away theyr youth , beauty and happiness of life . They are asking to answer the great riddle of time and entering into battle with it ! If you are so convinced , you should address Council of Astro Navigation ! I am speeking to its chairman ! But I did not give consent yet , Mven ! Is time for you to return to the big matters , Dar Veter ! The Council does not consider another candidate . You will give agreement , Veter ! Listen the report of the Council of Astro Navigation ! They return ! They return ! Veter , did you hear ? Did you already hear ? They return ! I am happy for you ! Very . The ship is in one hundredth of parsec from the orbit of Neptune . In a week " Tantra " will be welcomed home on Neptune 's hospitable moon , Triton and after a five-week quarantine , the Earth will joyfully greet " Tantra " ! THE END

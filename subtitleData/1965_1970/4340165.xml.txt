 All right , hold it . [ TIRES SCREECHING ] What 's the matter , senor ? We 're going around in a circle . No , senor . The desert looks the same everywhere . All right , how much further ? - Two , maybe three miles . - You sure ? We do not lie , senor . We told you what we have seen . Lights of shining colour and noises . Strange noises . It 's not too much further . Maybe two or three miles . I gave you 300 pesos . If this is some kind of con , forget it right now . Con ? [ BOTH SPEAK IN SPANISH ] Never mind . Let 's go . Oh ! [ BOTH SPEAK IN SPANISH ] Lights of shining colours . Yes , strange noises . [ LAUGHS ] [ BOTH SPEAK IN SPANISH ] [ TYRES SQUEALING ] [ PANTING ] [ ANNOUNCER READING ON-SCREEN TEXT ] ANNOUNCER : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . NARRATOR : The invaders : alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination : the Earth . Their purpose : to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road , looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . [ WHINING SOUND ] Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . ANNOUNCER : The guest stars in tonight 's story : Edward Andrews , Lin McCarthy , and special guest star , Suzanne Pleshette . [ ANNOUNCER READING ON-SCREEN TEXT ] NARRATOR : Three weeks since the report of a crash and strange , glowing lights had brought reporters , the Air Force and David Vincent to the border town of Rosario . Betrayed by his own kind and left to die under a blazing sun , he retains a vision of a ship launched by another kind under another sun . Now the Air Force and reporters have gone and David Vincent remains , to begin the search again . Vincent . Fellows , Air Force Intelligence , remember ? I thought you people left town a week ago . Vincent , you know what we used to run this thing down , before you even showed up ? Planes , helicopters , our best men . - Know what we found ? - Nothing . Where does that leave you now ? Up the creek . I 've been there before . Vincent . Now , I can 't check out of this oven until you call it quits . Put in for hardship pay . You wanna take a look at those pictures ? File them . Sorry , Mr. Fellows . I 'm sticking around . I saw something out there . I 'm sure it was a disabled space vehicle . Now , think about that . Release form for the jeep . How about the men who rolled me ? Well , Mexican police are holding them . I guess you 've about had it with our desert , huh ? Not quite . Why don 't you just do everybody a favour and take your nightmares and get out of here . When I 'm finished . Thanks . [ ENGINE STARTS ] [ TYRES SQUEALING ] You all right , Mr. Vincent ? Almost looked like they had you in their sights . Yeah , I guess I wasn 't paying attention . - Thank you . - Sure . Thank you very much . [ SIGHS ] Any mail ? Oh , Mr. Vincent . My name is Evans , Mr. Vincent . I 'm a freelance newspaperman . These are my credentials . I 'm here to see you , Mr. Vincent . You know , it came to me in the middle of the night that if David Vincent were right , oh-ho , boy , I 'd- - I 'd have a story that would be worth a fortune . What do you say , Mr. Vincent ? Couldn 't you use a couple of bucks ? - Not interested . - Don 't be a fool , Mr. Vincent . - I can help you . - How ? Well , I found somebody who 's telling the same story that you are . They say they know just exactly where this- - This spaceship is right now . And who is this somebody ? Oh , no , no , no . Not until after you agree to give me the exclusive . How reliable is is this informer of yours ? You 're the expert . You decide . [ BAND PLAYING STRIPTEASE MUSIC ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ MAN WHISTLING ] [ MAN LAUGHS ] [ MAN APPLAUDS ] MAN 1 : Yeah , that 's it . [ WHISTLES ] MAN 2 : Come on , baby . [ MEN WHISTLING ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ MUSIC STOPS ] How do you like her , huh ? It 'll depend . I- - I was talking about her act . So was I. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] - Ah , Vikki- - - Look , why don 't you leave me alone ? This is Mr. David Vincent . I told you , I don 't wanna talk about it . Go ahead , please , Vikki . Tell him what you told me . I 'm tired of getting the fisheye . Everybody 's thinks I 'm ready for the men in the white coats . No , no , no . I wanna hear your story . Will you sit down ? - Not just for laughs ? - No . All right . One more time . I was coming back from Mexico , sightseeing and all that jazz . [ BAND PLAYS LIVELY MUSIC ] Well , it started to get dark and , you know , this part of the country is not known for its street lights . And I made a wrong turn , only I didn 't know it until I realized I didn 't know where I was . Well , I started to get scared , so I pulled over to the side of the road and I pulled out the map . Then all of the sudden I saw this- - This thing , like lights flashing , fire everywhere . Like 20,000 jet engines , a whining sound and colour . You saw all this ? Sure . It was some kind of frantic . I looked through the lights and I could see motors starting and stopping like they were trying to get away , only they were stuck . Stuck bad . [ SIGHS ] There it goes . The fisheye again . No. no , no . Wait a minute . Do you think you can find this place again ? Mister , when I split the scene , it was goodbye , Charlie . I don 't want any part of it . Just answer my question . Could you find that place again ? - Yeah , I thinks so . But why should I ? - What if you were paid for it ? Like how much ? Mr. Evans here says he has a pretty valuable story . What about 25 percent of what he gets ? - Hey , wait a minute , wait a minute . - Otherwise , you have nothing . That 's probably the way it will wind up anyhow , so why bother . A hundred , cash . - Can you make it two ? - We 'll have two . And the car ? I have a jeep . All right . I 'll meet you in front of the hotel at 9 : 00 tomorrow morning . Good . Uh ... Can I buy you a drink ? I better go back to work . You are pretty good at spending my money . Not spending , investing . You 're not leaving now ? - She does a great second show . - Yeah , well , I 'm beat . The show I wanna see starts tomorrow at 9 . Good luck then to all of us . Yeah , thanks . He will be delivered tomorrow . EVANS [ OVER DEVICE ] : Repeat , he will be delivered tomorrow . We will be ready . Where 's the girl ? It 's just 9 : 00 , she ought to be here any second . - Sure you don 't wanna come ? - No , I told you . This crummy town 's all the adventure I need . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] [ DOG BARKING ] Good morning . - Have you got the money ? - Yeah , right here . Oh , Vincent , take good care of yourself . I 've got a big investment in you . [ ENGINE STARTS ] About how far is it ? Look , I know I 'm not paying for conversation , but I have to know a few things . A couple of hours . Thanks . Look , let 's just get this over with and cut out the small talk , huh ? [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Hey , you sure you 've got the right room ? A few questions I 'd like to ask about a mutual friend , - Uh-huh . - David Vincent . Oh . [ LAUGHS ] Look , Mac , he may be a friend of yours but me , a buddy like that I do not need . You were together a while ago with that girl . That 's what I mean . I spend all week priming the pump and he takes off with the whole well . - Where to ? - I don 't know . She said something about visiting friends across the border . Sounds like a real wild scene . Do you know why he 's here ? Oh , you mean the- - The little green men and all ? I doubt if that 's what he said . Well , pretty close . By the way , Evans , will you be around for a while ? For a while . [ DOOR CLOSES ] They 're on their way . EVANS : Time of departure , nine plus seven . Repeat , nine plus seven . There 's a lighter in the compartment . Can I have it please ? [ OPENS COMPARTMENT ] That 's very nice . It has a flaw . But then , haven 't we all . Want something to eat ? [ TYRES SQUEALING ] [ SIGHING ] Sorry . Lost my head . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] [ BOTH SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] I already ordered for you , if that 's alright . [ BOY SCREAMS ] [ SCREAMING IN SPANISH ] [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] - You all right ? - Mm-hm . You sure ? [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] It 's all right . [ COINS DROP ON THE TABLE ] [ GROANS SOFTLY ] - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm just great . What 's wrong with you ? You sat there like it was a floor show . Leave me alone . - What is with you ? - You 're hurting me . I didn 't think that was possible . Here , let me help you . - It 'll be all right . - It 's cold cream . It 's good for burns . Do it yourself . Do you have to drive so fast ? I haven 't changed my speed in an hour . Here . Stop here . Is this where you saw the ship ? I think so . Where was it ? There , over that rise . You wait here . David . David , I 've made a mistake . This isn 't the place . Well , something made you stop . I 'll check it out . Well , all this terrain looks alike , David . You can see- - Take my word for it , David . I 'm sure it 's a little more to that- - That side . All right , you 've seen the ship . Now , let 's get out of here . - Get my gun . - No . David , I 'm staying with you . Now . David , wait for me . Don 't leave me . They 'll kill me . Why should they ? [ PANTING ] Because they think I warned you . [ BOTH PANTING ] Now , you 're supposed to start crying and say I 'm sorry . Tell me , why ? Why all the hocus-pocus ? Why the kids in the hot rod ? Why the so-called rescue by Evans ? Why the striptease ? Don 't . It had to be that way . The ship was in trouble . The refracted light we 'd sent up to protect us only helped from the air . The ship still is in trouble and you- - You were getting too close . You wanted to help me back there . No . You wanted to help me . Why ? Why ? I don 't know why . I want an answer . You 're alive . Why don 't you just leave it at that and trust me . You 're one of them . I can 't trust you . No , I said it 's just a hunch . Unless you 're ordering me back to Washington , I- - Yes , I know Vincent has left , but I 'm not- - Yes , sir . I 'll take the next plane out . Yes , sir . Goodbye , sir . Not that far . Get over here when I can keep an eye on you . [ COUGHS ] I forgot . I 'm one of them . Aren 't you ? All right . I am an alien . But I am to them too . What is that supposed to mean ? [ SCOFFS ] As if you could understand . As if you could possibly understand . Well , I could try . All right . I 'm different , that 's all . Ever since I was little , I had this- - This thing in me , this difference . Like my- - [ CHUCKLES ] I suppose here you 'd call him my father . He had this difference too and he couldn 't live with it either , so he- - He stood up against them and they- - They killed him . What is this difference ? I 'm not sure . I only know we can 't be like the others . Life means something to us and death . In other words , you 're capable of feeling . [ CHUCKLES ] You make it sound like it 's something I should feel happy about . [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] David . That 's what happens to us when we die here on Earth . [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] What will you do now ? If we can get back to civilization , I 'll call Fellows and get him out here . - I won 't be long . - Okay . Help you ? Yes , girl that calls herself Vikki- - Later , mister . The show don 't go on until tonight . - What do you know about her ? - What 's it to you ? Hey , if you 're gonna catch that plane , you better hurry up , like , right now . Okay . Did you do any checking on her ? Yeah , after she came to work . I called the guy she said was her agent to see , you know , if the guy had anymore girls like her- - You know what ? He never heard of her . MANAGER : Doesn 't make sense . Take my bags back to the hotel . [ SIGHS ] Thanks . Oh , you go on . There 's a ranch house not far from here . I can 't make it . [ POUNDING ON DOOR ] [ BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY ] - What do you want ? - Help , senor . We 're running from bad people . Men who would destroy us . I cannot help you . We have troubles of our own . Your truck , does it run ? I 'll pay you for it . The truck- - Something is broken , senor . [ BOTH SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] [ COUGHS ] - Are you all right , senorita ? - Yes , yes . [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] - You know something about trucks ? - Yes , a little bit . If you can make it run , there 's a telephone west of here . The station is called Dos Lobos . All right , I 'll try to get it to run . I 'll be back as soon as possible . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] [ WOMAN SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] You may need this . Thank you . [ HENS CLUCKING ] David . What 's the matter ? David , I wanna go with you . It 'll be safer for you here . I 'll be back soon . And then what ? Just a loose fuel line . Senor . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] Do you have any gasoline ? [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] Senor , the gate . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] And then what , David ? You gonna make me go to the authorities with you ? That 's right . I can 't do that , David . Helping you is one thing , but betraying them ... They 'd destroy you if they had the chance . Take me with you , David . I know . You think I should be happy about being able to feel and to care . Well , for the first time I am . Before I met you , I- - I was ashamed of caring because there was no one to care for . But now there is and I wanna stay with you . Vikki , you came millions of miles to this place . You came in a different form from a different world . That doesn 't matter . Not to me . I 'm sorry . I have to go . [ ENGINE STARTS ] He 's on his way to place a called Dos Lobos . He 's going to call a man named Fellows . Do not worry , senora . He will be back soon . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] A little coffee ? Yes , thank you . [ PHONE BELL RINGS ] Operator , quiera La Popular Hotel in Rosario . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] [ COIN CLANGS ] [ PHONE BELL RINGS ] [ SIGHS ] [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] Well , can 't you break in ? [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] No , I 'll lead the search myself . I want a plane gassed and ready to go in 40 minutes . Two hours ? All right , that will have to do . No , I don 't want you to clear it with Washington or Mexico City . I 'll take the responsibility . Oh , lieutenant , one other thing . I don 't want the name of Vincent mentioned . [ HANGS UP PHONE ] [ PHONE RINGS ] - Fellows here . - It 's David Vincent . You gotta meet me down here right away . - Why , what 's up ? - The spaceship . I 've pinpointed its location . - You what ? - I swear I know where it is . - Is the girl with you ? - Yeah , she 's one of them . But for some reason , she 's helping me . DAVID : It 's that newspaper man , Evans . He 's the one running the whole thing . Now , you 've gotta meet me down here right away . FELLOWS [ OVER PHONE ] : All right . Where ? DAVID : There 's a small ranch about seven miles due-east of Dos Lobos . I 'm heading back there now to pick up Vikki . FELLOWS : I 'll be there . [ PHONE CLICKS ] Make out my bill . Call me a cab , please . [ SPEAKS IN SPANISH ] No , thank you . I 'm not very hungry . Oh . [ MAN AND WOMAN SPEAK IN SPANISH ] You 're wasting time . He may not come back . You 'll be needed at the ship . Vikki . DAVID : Vikki . How can he hurt us ? When the spaceship is gone , nobody will believe a word he says . It 's better not to kill him . With him dead , people will ask questions . They 'll wonder . It 's better not to kill him . Vikki . David ! David ! Watch out ! [ GUN COCKS ] [ GUNSHOTS ] [ GUN COCKING ] [ WHINING SOUND ] The spaceship 's gone . Where 's the girl ? [ WATER SPLASHING ] She 's gone too . Ah . Just like that . I come all the way out here and ... Where did she go ? They killed her . No , there 's no body . There 's nothing . DAVID : They were here . Ask them . My name is Fellows , U.S. Air Force Intelligence . What happened here ? Horrible , strange men pushed into our house . He helped us . These strange men , do you know who they were ? Terrible men with faces like- - Like masks of steel . How about it , Fellow ? Still sound like a tale told by an idiot ? I 'll pick up Evans when we get back to town . Let 's see what happens then . He won 't be there . Believe me . Well ? A couple of days ago I 'd have had a quick answer for you . Right now , I 'm not so sure . When will you be sure ? When it 's too late ? NARRATOR : For a moment , in the desert south of Rosario , a man and a woman came together across a void of space and time . Two people star-crossed from alien worlds . In the months to come , [ ENGINE STARTS ] David Vincent would remember that moment .

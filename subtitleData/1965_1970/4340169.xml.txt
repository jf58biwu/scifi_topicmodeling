Alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination : the Earth . Their purpose : to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road , looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner , and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . NARRATOR 1 : The guest stars in tonight 's story : Kathleen Widdoes , Robert Emhart , Jeanette Nolan , James Callahan . [ ANNOUNCER READS ON-SCREEN TEXT ] NARRATOR 2 : Thirty miles from the geographical centre of America , at its very heart , is the town of Grady . Population : 5,312 . Principal industry : farming . Grady , Kansas , the American gothic , rigid , proud of its tradition . Protective of its own . Resentful of any threat from the world outside . [ DOOR OPENS ] - She 's moved . - Could you tell me where ? We don 't know where . MAN : You looking for Ellen ? - That 's right . What about ? It 's about this story on the locusts . I wanna ask her some questions . Look , fellow , she was scared , said a lot of wild things , things she just imagined . Things she just imagined . But she 's all right now . She 's herself again . MAN : Questions would just upset her . If she doesn 't wanna talk to me , she 'll say so . Forget it , fellow . Now , you just catch a bus and get out of town . I 'd appreciate it . - I 'll think about it . MAN : You do that . Ugh ! Honestly , one of these days , we 'll all be eaten alive . [ KNOCKING ] MAN : Yes ? DAVID : Mr. Ames ? AMES : Come in . I 'll be right there now . Just wait a moment . Mr. Ames ? You 're one of those newspaper fellows from the city . No , sir . I 'm David Vincent . I 'm here looking for Ellen Woods . I wanna ask her some questions . I know you 're the principal of the school where she teaches . I wonder if you know where she is . Is she here ? I can 't tell you where she is , Mr. Vincent . Well , why not ? I 've talked to five people in this town . It seems everyone 's trying to keep me from talking to her . Perhaps if I told you something , you 'd understand . I might . Ellen has always been a nervous , and , well , sensitive girl . About a year ago , just before she was to be married , there was a terrible accident . Both of her parents were killed . Now , for weeks , she just refused to believe that they were dead . Now , she was in a sanitarium in the city for a few months . AMES : Well , since she 's been home , she 's been getting along just fine . That is , until this business of the locusts . She 's getting married in a few weeks . I 'm afraid a lot of questions will just upset her again . I won 't be upset , Mr. Ames . Really . - Ellen , you shouldn 't be up . - I 'm all right , really . Now , Ellen , there is no need to tire yourself . - Now , please go back to your room . - I 'm fine . I 'm fine . What would you like to know ? I 'd like to clear this up once and for all . Miss Woods , David Vincent . Uh , it 's about that newspaper article I read . Now , you say you saw a metallic box , and that box brought the locusts . The box I imagined I saw . When those newspapermen found me , I was still hysterical from the locust attack . There was no box . I don 't care what I told them . There was no box . It was- - It was- - It was all in my mind . Well , even so , would you mind telling me what it looked like ? Mr. Vincent , look , she just told you she imagined it . Miss Woods . I , uh ... I forget . Do you also forget the Danielsons were there ? The constable ? The Danielsons both denied having been in their barn that afternoon . AMES : The constable was in his office . One of his deputies , Henry Braden , swore to that . Mr. Ames , I think they 're lying . I didn 't see anything in that barn . What frightened you so much that you ran to the next farm ? Nothing . Nothing frightened me . - Did they try to hurt you ? - I think you should stop now . Miss Woods , you said you saw a metallic box that brought the locusts . - Did it ? - I tell you , I- - You 're holding something back . Did it ? No , I just imagined it . How could it ? - You said it could , once . - I was wrong . Now , why are you lying ? Who are you afraid of ? She 's had enough . Now , get out of here . Will you please go ? - Yes , sir ? - Coffee , please . - Anything else ? - No , thank you . Well , maybe you could help me out . I 'm looking for the people who own that farm where the girl was caught in that locust attack . - The Morgans ? - Yes . Do you know them ? Well , I did . They moved . They sold their farm and moved away just yesterday . Can 't say that I blame them . You friends of theirs ? No , just interested in the farm . Who bought it ? Ira Danielson . He has the farm next door . [ DOOR OPENS ] WOMAN : Hello , Ed . [ WOMAN SCREAMS ] Hold him . [ GRUNTING ] You get the message ? Stay away from her . [ GROANS ] - He 's out cold . - It was your brother , Ed . They went out the back door . Shall I go after him ? Why ? You wanna get your brother in trouble ? This one had it coming anyway . Grab his arms . We 're taking him in . All right , outside . We 're giving you a break , Vincent . We 're driving you over to the next town , to Myers Corner , where you 're catching a bus out . What about the guys who beat me up ? You do anything about them ? That 's my job . Stop sticking your nose in other people 's business . All right , Braden , let 's go . [ KNOCKING ] Ed ? - Oh , Ed . ED : It 's okay . It 's okay . That Vincent guy won 't bother you anymore , honey . Ed ... He believed me , Ed . How can he believe when I don 't ? I 've tried so hard not to believe . Tried so hard not- - ? Ellen . Come on , honey , Just tell me the truth . Don 't be scared . You can tell me anything . What 'd you see in Ira Danielson 's barn ? - Oh , Ed . - Just tell me . Ed , can 't we just forget about all this ? All I wanna do is to move into the house- - Ellen , nothing you do or say 'll ever change the way I feel about you . Don 't be afraid to tell me . As God is my witness , Ed . I saw Ira Danielson in that barn . And his son , Fred , and Constable Gabbard . And there was a metallic box with dials and things . It made a loud whining noise . And ... - And ... ? - And ... I believe what Mr. Vincent said , that it brought the locusts . Oh , Ed . Ed , I 'm so sorry . I know it sounds crazy , but it 's what I saw . That 's all right . You have nothing to be sorry about . Ellen , I love you . I 've loved you ever since we were kids . And I 'll stay with you until you forget all about these locusts and this nightmare , the whole thing . I can wait . I don 't care . I can wait forever . You come first . This looks good . Pull over . Put me through to Danielson . [ GRUNTS ] [ INSECTS BUZZING ] I don 't understand it . All the years I 've lived here , I 've never seen anything like this . - I don 't understand it . ELLEN : Mr. Ames ! Mr. Ames , the locusts , they 've come back . I know . We 've got to get there . You 'll see for yourself . The box . Ellen , you just said you imagined all that . We 've got to get to the Danielsons' while the locusts are still here . Ellen , I forbid you to go out there . Now , go back to your room . You 're hurting my wrist . Ellen , I didn 't mean to hurt you , but I cannot let you go out into that . Now , come on , my dear . Go on up to your room . Now , come on . Ellen . Come back here . Don 't go out there . Ellen . AMES : Ellen , come back here . You were right , Oliver . The poor thing . [ INSECTS BUZZING ] ELLEN : Mr. Vincent ! Mr. Vincent . - We 've gotta- - We have to go . - Come on . Never mind . [ SHRIEKING ] All right . Take it easy . Take it easy . Stand still . I 'll get them off you . All right , I 'll get them off my back . - It 's all right . Are you all right ? - Yes . Yes , wait . It 's all right . Calm down . - Come on . - Wait for me . What is this , Mr. Vincent ? I don 't know . I 'm not sure . I 'm not sure of anything but those locusts . - They 're all after us . - That 's impossible . [ BUZZING ] Let 's go . Where are we going ? I 'm going to call the state police . Do you trust Ames ? Yes . Yes , I think so . You drive to his house , call Ed , tell him to stay with you till I get some help . You 're in danger here . I don 't understand . Why would anyone want to hurt me ? If they wanted to kill me , they could 've done it after I saw that box . That would 've aroused too much curiosity . Now they have no choice . You 've seen too much . I 'll make my call from that lunchroom there . Remember , call Ed , tell him what happened . Wait for me at Ames ' house . - Got a telephone ? - Yeah , right there in the washroom . Operator , I want the state police . It 's an emergency . Hello , I wanna speak to whoever 's on duty . This is an emergency . Yes , my name is David Vincent . I 'm calling from a coffee shop called the Lunch Counter . It 's in the town of Grady . Now , listen to me , please . Well , Mr. Vincent . That isn 't really in our jurisdiction . We 'll see what we can do . I 'll have somebody out there in a few minutes . - All right . Thank you very much . - All right . Hello , this is Jim Walton . Fine , just fine . Listen , we just got a call from somebody in Grady . A David Vincent . Yeah . He says he 's in some kind of trouble out at the Lunch Counter . CONSTABLE : Sure . Okay . I 'll go over and pick him up . Thanks . Pick who up ? Not my brother again ? No , just Braden . He got a flat tyre . I 'll drop him off at his place on my way home . - Lock up when you 're through there . - Sure . Ellen , thank heaven you 're safe . We were gonna look for you in Miss Havergill 's car . I tried to stop you , dear . Whatever possessed you ? I 'm sorry I hurt you , but I 'd have used any kind of force to- - What are you doing ? - He 's not there . - Who 's not there ? Ed . I want Ed to stay with me until the police get here . Police ? What for ? What happened out there , Ellen ? AMES : What did you see ? - Ellen . - I don 't know . Something . I don 't know . I can 't remember . I can 't remember anything . Please find Ed . I want Ed to take me back to that sanitarium . Do you understand ? I want Ed . Yes , it 's all right , dear . Now , just be calm . Now , everything 's going to be all right . Please . Can 't one of you stay ? ELLEN : 'We could have some tea . Don 't you be afraid . I 'm going to say right by your side every minute . Sit down . Well , how 's the shoulder ? - Fine . Can I have some coffee ? - Yeah . Can you tell me something ? There 's a farm next to the Danielsons ' place . They have a double silo . Oh , yeah , sure . That used to belong to a fellow named Kirby . He sold out too , right after the first locust attack , oh , a couple months ago . Then he got disgusted with the boys from the Agriculture Department when they couldn 't come up with an answer . - Who bought it ? - Oh , the constable , Ned Gabbard . - He 's got some men working it for him . - Local people ? No . He brought some of his family in from out of town . Couple of months after he got here . I don 't know any of them too well . They don 't seem to be mixers , you know what I mean ? - Yeah . Thanks . - Yeah , sure . [ TIRES SQUEAL ] What is it , Ned ? What 's going on ? Was there a fellow in here using the phone ? Stranger , dark suit ? Yeah . He just went back in there . [ DOOR CLOSES ] - Where 's Ellen ? - She 's upstairs . - Miss Havergill is with her . Ed , no . - I 've gotta see her . - Ed , listen to me . - I wanna be with her . Do you want to lose her for good ? I 've called the doctors in the city . They don 't want you to see her . I 'm sorry , Ed , but it 's their orders . Oliver , that isn 't fair . - How could they be so cruel ? - What do they know ? They were supposed to help her before . I 've made arrangements with a new hospital , Ed . Better doctors . What new hospital ? I don 't care what anyone says . Ellen isn 't going anywhere . But they 're doctors , Ed . The Forsythe Clinic . Believe me , they know what they 're talking about . She wants to go , Ed . And if the doctors say you shouldn 't see her ... They insist she be spared any emotional strain , Ed , of any kind . AMES : They 're afraid of what might happen during a goodbye with you . I 'm driving her to the city . The doctors insist upon her getting there as quickly as possible . - When is Ed coming ? - He should be here soon , Ellen . I want Ed to take me to the city , no one else . Yes , dear , yes . Just try to get a rest now . It 's going to be a long drive . Miss Havergill . When Ed comes , you 'll send him up right away , won 't you ? There 's something I must tell him . Of course . Just don 't you worry about a thing . Ed ? Ed ? [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] ELLEN : Why ? Why wouldn 't you let him see me ? We told you , dear . Doctors ' orders . He respects that . Because he loves you . - We 'd better leave now . - No , no . - Why can 't Ed take me to the city ? - Please , Ellen . - Don 't be more difficult- - - Let me go . Let me go . - Here . You must be calm . - Please , Ellen . No , please , help me . - He 's trying to kill me . - Nobody 's trying to hurt you . - We 're trying to help you . - No , he is . Get Ed for me . Get Ed . You poor child . You poor twisted child . - Help me . Please , help me . Help me . - Please get the medicine . - No . No . Help . Help me . No . - We don 't want her to hurt herself . - No , please get Ed for me , please . - Take it easy . - Deep breaths . - That 's a good girl . - What are you doing here ? - I need your help . - Get out . - Now , listen , just for a minute . Ellen 's in danger . I called the state police , but something went wrong . - Answer this . Did you talk to Ellen ? - Ames wouldn 't let me . He 's taking her to the city , to a mental hospital . - Why wouldn 't he let you talk to her ? - Doctors ' orders . Will you leave us alone ? Get out of here . Ellen 's going to be killed . I know it 's hard to believe , but Ellen 's going to be killed . We 've got to stop it . She 's gonna be killed , Ed . I 'm calling the constable . You 're the one that- - You 'll regret calling the constable , Ed . Gabbard took a shot at me . - Why ? Why would he- - ? - For the reason Ellen 's in trouble . She 's seen too much . If you wanna make a phone call , call that hospital Ames says he 's taking her to . The last thing in the world they want is to get her to the doctor . Go ahead , call the hospital . Go on . Operator . Uh ... Give me information on Wichita . Yes , I 'll wait . Information ? Um ... Could you give me the number of the Forsythe Clinic ? Ed , you seen that Vincent fella ? The guy I kicked out of town . Yes . Yes , thank you . Well , how about it , Ed ? Did you see him ? No , Mr. Gabbard . I haven 't . He probably moved on . Well , I got a tip he 's still in town . If you see him , let me know . Yes , I 'll do that . He 's gone . - What 'd the operator say ? - There 's no such hospital . - Well , come on , let 's go . - I don 't understand . - Why would anybody wanna- - ? - There 's no time . ED : Why would anyone wanna kill- - ? Did you call Danielson ? Is everything ready ? Yes . - Ed . - Where 's Ellen ? - I thought the constable- - - Where 's Ellen ? Oliver just took her , with Miss Havergill . ED : How long ago ? WOMAN 1 : Just now , a minute ago . Oh , Ed , she kept saying such wild , crazy things . WOMAN 1 : Said Oliver was trying to kill her . WOMAN 2 : Oliver had to quiet her with some medicine . But what is it , Ed ? What 's wrong ? My brother Carl lives out of town , by the highway . He 'll stop them . Carl . Carl , this is Ed . Listen , there 's something you 've gotta do for me . Now , Ames has taken Ellen in Miss Havergill 's car . I want you to go out on that highway and stop them . Carl , no questions . Just do what I ask . Ellen 's life may depend on it . I don 't care how you do it , but do it . Come on , Ames ' car is outside . Everything you 've told me- - I 'm not saying I believe you , I 'm not saying I don 't , but why Grady ? I can only guess . Grady 's about three miles from dead centre of America . I think they 're gonna try and send signal vibrations from that silo . Vibrations to reach every point of America simultaneously . Now , if that happens , insects will attack from every point . For every square mile of the Earth 's surface , there must be millions of insects . Now , that 's quite an ally . Ed , in that silo , I saw butterflies eat flesh . Butterflies . They got the owners of the surrounding farms to sell out . Danielson and Gabbard bought them . Now those silos are surrounded by private property owned by them . - Did you see him ? - They never came this way . They must 've turned off on Iverson Road . What 's going on ? Iverson Road . That 's past Danielson 's place . - Get to a phone and call the FBI . - What ? Carl , give me your gun . - What 's going on ? - Call the FBI . We 'll be at Danielson 's place . Hurry up . [ SHRIEKING ] [ TIRES SCREECH ] [ CONSTABLE SCREAMS ] [ INSECTS BUZZING ] It 's okay . [ BEEPING ] [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] [ EXPLOSION ] What did you find out ? They 've all left town . Havergill , Ames , half a dozen families . We can 't prove anything , can we ? Well , why not ? I want you both to talk to the FBI . Please , Mr. Vincent , I have Ed now . All I want is to be left in peace with him . ELLEN : I- - I can 't live through another nightmare of people listening to a story they don 't believe . People looking at me as if I were crazy . Do you understand that ? No , I don 't understand it . Not after all that 's happened . I 'm sorry , Mr. Vincent . We 're just not going to talk . Ever . I 'm sorry . That 's it . All right . Good luck to both of you . NARRATOR 2 : Grady , Kansas proud of its tradition , protective of its own , resentful of any threat from the world outside . David Vincent has faced the Invader here . And for a little while , that threat has been pushed aside .

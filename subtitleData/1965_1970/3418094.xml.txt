 We maintain normal atmospheric pressure in here by a special mixture of oxygen and helium . Never mind the scientific lecture , Miller . Just what is this crazy project you 've dragged me down here to see ? Mr. Hollister , this project meets the most important challenge of the future . Never mind the future . Just give me the past . - An oyster 's- - - There she is . - Where ? - Right there . Dead ahead . Well , I see where is it , but what is it ? It looks like a large onion . That 's what we call it , " The Green Onion . " Two hundred thousand dollars for an underwater onion ? It 's a house . A completely self-sufficient , underwater house . A house for what ? Flounders ? Underwater living is coming , T.R. It has to . At the present population growth , in the predictable future , there 'll be one human being for every square foot of land on Earth . Can you imagine what that means ? This is your future living space unless- - People weren 't meant to live underwater . Or fly . Or go to the moon . We can 't continue to ignore 71 percent of the Earth 's surface , T.R. , just because it 's underwater . - Wait till you see the inside . - Take me back . One more minute . Of all the wild , impossible , money-wasting schemes I 've ever heard of , this absolutely takes the cake . T.R. , hey ! Not in this artificial atmosphere . It won 't be long now , Mr. Miller . Two hundred thousand dollars down the drain , and all I wind up with is a cold in the head . Fred Miller 's still waiting to see you , Mr. Hollister . Well , I don 't want to see him . I 'm afraid I might kill him . T.R. , the whole thing was merely an unfortunate accident . The first accident was you , Briggs . Putting that nincompoop Fred Miller in charge of research and development . I 'm not a nincompoop . You are an unemployed nincompoop . Our competitor 's developing defense facilities , undersea oil wells , while we are building $ 200,000 playhouses . It 's not a playhouse . It 's a practical home for a typical American family to live in , - and I can prove it . - How ? By having a family live in it for 30 days . That 's absolutely preposterous . Ridiculous . T.R. , we ought to at least test this project before we write off all that money . We could run an ad , interview families- - Ads and interviews . Are you insane ? Why , if news of this nutty project gets out , our stock would drop 20 points . But , T.R. , we- - No buts , no buts . I want this house destroyed , dismantled immediately . I want all the records burned at sea , if necessary . I know a family that 'll do it . No one has to know a thing about it . The only family we have to talk to . - What family ? - My family . Your family ? Why , your wife , Vivian is afraid of water . She 's an aquaphobe . I can convince her . Well , now wait a minute , wait . You said a typical American family . Your family is typical ? Why , yes , T.R. They 're extraordinarily typical . I can 't make the rains to fall No , no I can 't climb a mountain tall No , no But I can love you Yes , I can love you I can 't make the sun to shine No , no I can 't stop the hands of time No , no But I can love you Yes , I can love you Nobody but me Can hold you tight Nobody but me Can treat you right Nobody but me Knows what to say I 'm the only one Who knows the way Yeah , I can love you Yeah , I can love you Baby I can 't make the sun to shine No , no I can 't stop the hands of time No , no But I can love you Welcome home , Mr. Miller . - What ? - Welcome home . Thank you . Hi , Viv . Hey , Viv ? Forty Nights in a Harem . That 's a good title . Hi , darling . What did you say ? I said , Forty Nights in a Harem , that 's- - Good commercial title , don 't you think ? Hey , darling , why don 't you go relax . I want to finish the seduction scene , okay ? I can love you I can love you Hi , Daddy . Hello , kids . Hello , Harold . Hello , Marvin . Hello , Mr. Miller . Lorrie , I think you found it . You 've finally found it . Don 't you think so , Mr. Miller ? - What are they looking for ? - The sound . Yes , they found it . - No , man , not just any sound . - The sound . The sound that 's gonna make us millionaires . Well , Mr. Ashbury says our last number was really close . Is Mr. Ashbury an ear specialist ? Nate Ashbury ? Why , he 's the founder , chairman of the board and president of Stentorian Records . Stentorian ? That means loud . - Right . - Yeah . We 're gonna take this new number down to him now . - Isn 't it kind of late ? - Well , not for Mr. Ashbury . He 's a boy millionaire . Works around the clock . - Come on , let 's go . - Bye , Daddy . Come on , Marvin . Bye , Myrtle . Thanks a lot . - Bye , Myrtle . - I got my fingers crossed . Ciao . I think this ... You got problems , Mr. Miller ? No . You want a swig of my tonic ? No , thank you , Myrtle . I 'm on the wagon . Hey . You 're supposed to be relaxing . Yeah . I am . - Problems ? - No . Viv ? How 's the writing coming along ? I really think it 's going to sell . It 's all about a girl piano-tuner who works in a harem . Girl piano-tuner , huh ? That 's brilliant . - Will you look at those children ? - Viv ? What , dear ? Listen , why don 't you write a story about a family that lives in an experimental house . An experimental house ? - One that you designed ? - Right . And I promised T.R. that this family would live in it for the next 30 days . Without even consulting us ? Gee whiz , I thought you 'd love the idea . T.R. insists that we have a family test it , so- - Test it ? The house has to be tested ? Is there something wrong with it ? - It 's gonna fall down ? - No , the family has to be tested . Their reactions to the modern conveniences , - the ultramodern comfort , - Where is this house ? - the breathtaking decor , - Where is this house ? the push-button labor-saving devices , the beautiful , magnificent , ever-changing view , - Where is this house ? - the serenity and charm- - - Fred . - Yes ? Where is this house ? Well , it 's about three miles off the coast . An island ? It 's built on a foundation of solid rock , about 90 feet- - About 90 feet , what ? Underwater . Underwater ? You must be out of your mind ! Oh , no , Captain Bligh . You 're not giving this girl the deep six . Honey , the house is watertight . Well , I think you 're tight . And not on water . Have you ever known me to take a drink ? Or else you 've been nipping on Myrtle 's tonic . You know I 'm terrified of water . I can 't even swim . You don 't have to swim . We 'd get there in a submarine . A submarine ! That 's marvelous , that 's wonderful . - Honey , will you- - ? - Don 't touch me . How do you know you won 't like it when you haven 't even tried it ? I haven 't tried cutting my wrists either , because some strange instinct of self-survival says , " Drop the razor , Viv . " And right now it 's saying , " Drop dead , buster . " Don 't you touch me . This is pure hysteria . You haven 't given me one rational reason . All right , I 'll give you a rational reason . I don 't like the neighborhood . It 's very exclusive . Good . Then exclude me out . - Where are you going ? - I am going to my bedroom . Now , just a minute . You mean our bedroom . That 's where you 're wrong . I mean my bedroom . Viv , honey . Baby . Come on . And furthermore , I hate you . Would you like a little more time to think it over ? Yeah , I can love you Yeah , I can love you Baby I can love you I can love you Out of sight . I think it is out of sight . Cool it . Just wait one minute . Let us see if it has turned on the brain machine . I would certainly advise that , Mr. Ashbury . After all , my computer analyzed and selected your last ten hits . Doc , now you know that I flip over every teensy tube in your gassy little think tank . Dr. Wells has a Ph.D. in computer analysis . Yeah , yeah , yeah . I think she 's a ding-a-ling . What seems to be the hang-up , doc ? Stuck . - What 's it say ? - How important is that ? - Is it gonna make it for us ? - What does it say ? This musical selection correlates with a vibratory resonance index of .95 . - Meaning ? - Meaning .95 affirmative . Cool it . Okay , doc , what 's with the other five points ? - Negative . - That 's a bummer . - Where does it say that ? - Right there . I 've been just atrocious , haven 't I ? No , no . Not really . I mean , this thing means a lot to you . It means everything . I 've been a bad wife . Even my job is at stake . Bad , bad , bad . My whole career , for that matter . Unfeeling , selfish , thoughtless . Your future , my future , the kids ' future . Even trifling things like Tommie 's new surfboard . Bad , bad , bad . Viv ? - Are you listening to me ? - Of course . What was I talking about ? Tommie 's surfboard . Then you still won 't do it , huh ? Do what ? Live in the underwater house . But of course I will . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . You will , Viv ? Darling , I don 't know if I can last the full 30 days , but I 'll try . Then you 're reconciled to the dan- - The inconvenience ? I 'm reconciled to you . Here are the kids . Shall we tell them ? Why not ? They 'll love it . Underwater ? ! Daddy , it 's impossible . I 'll die . We can 't go away now , underwater or anywhere else . We 're just five index points from a hit record . But , children , I explained how important it is to your father . It 's only for 30 days . Harold can 't wait 30 days . Please , Daddy , don 't ask us to walk out on Harold . Where would he find two more Hang Ups ? Maybe Harold and his brother could come with us . - What ? - Down there ? Fred , why not ? Yeah , why not ? You can work on your song down there . - The acoustics are perfect . - I don 't know . Well , why don 't you go call Harold and find out . All right . I 'll tell his parents we 're going on a trip or something . This is supposed to be a secret . All right , but if he breaks off the engagement , it 's your fault . - Who says they 're engaged ? - Don 't worry about it . Don 't worry , Dad . Harold 's father will let him go . He 's been threatening to send Harold to Alaska . - Hello . - Harold ? How would you like to live with us in a new house for 30 days ? Thirty days ? That 's right , Harold , 30 days . Sure . I 'd love to . You will ? That 's wonderful . Where is this new house ? Where 's the house ? Well , that 's the one teensy-weensy little thing I didn 't tell you . And it 's the best part of all , because of the acoustics . And it 's top-secret , so don 't breathe a word of it to your parents . It 's located three miles offshore , and about 90 feet underwater . Underwater ? ! We 're here , kids . We 're home . I can 't wait . Okay . - I can 't find- - - Give me your hand . Thank you , dear . I 'm coming . - Wow . - Wow . - That 's too much . Come on , Marv . - Wow . Look at all the fish ! I don 't believe it . It 's like an aquarium . Daddy , it 's great . Fred , darling , it 's beautiful . It 's not only beautiful , it 's functional . We get our light , our power , everything from the ocean . Oh , I 'm so proud of you . What 's that ? That 's the Duke and the Duchess . It 's cute . They 're dolphins that made friends with us while we built this place . But , Daddy , are they gonna come back ? Sure . Now you kids unload the sub . Okay . I 'm going to show you the answer to a maiden 's prayer . - What ? - A perfect kitchen . Behold , your refrigerator . Flora and fauna of the sea . Harvested or caught in your own front yard . That 's incredible . Now , here 's your garbage disposal . Be sure you incinerate before you eject . - Yes , sir . - Very important . Okay . - The sink . - Wonderful . - Push that button . - This one ? - Yeah . - What 'll happen ? Oh , look . Your dishwasher . - I don 't believe- - - Behind you is your oven . Here 's your hot plate . Did you really design all of this ? I am truly impressed . Recipe book . Baked kelp , broiled kelp , fried kelp , deviled kelp , kelp . - Wonderful . - Now here 's your clothes washer . And there 's a special detergent in my lab , right there . Well , I 'm sure everyone 's starved , so I 'll see what I can- - I knew you 'd love it . - Let me take this . - No , that 's all right , darling . I 'll- - - I have to tell T.R. we 've arrived . - Okay . I hope Myrtle Ruth- - I hope Myrtle Ruth got everything straight . When 's she coming in ? Saturday , 12 : 00 . Groovy . That gives us plenty of time . Well , how 's she gonna- - ? Well , how is she gonna know how to find us ? I told her to go three miles due north of the pier . That 's where Daddy says we are . You better not start anything with me , fatso . There 's a recipe in here for you too , you know . Green Onion calling T.R. Green Onion calling T.R. Come in , Miller . T.R. here . And speak discreetly . This isn 't a private channel , you know . Will do , T.R. Just wanted to report that we arrived safely . If you haven 't any objections , I 'm sending a crew over for the large sub . We 'll leave you the little one . That 's okay with me . Is Viv down there with you ? She sure is . You aren 't much on research and development , Miller , but if you talked Vivian into staying down there , I ought to make you head of sales . I 'll bet you she doesn 't last two days . Is that so ? Well , just name the stakes . I already did . Your job . Wait a minute . What is this ridiculous-looking contraption you 're dragging into my office ? Well , this is a scale model , sir , of the H-O-D . H-O-D . HOD . I can spell . But what does it mean ? I named it after you , sir . The " Hollister Ore Dredge . " I like the title . Is this one of Fred Miller 's nutty ideas ? Not at all , T.R. Cheever , here , developed this on his own . Right , Mel ? Well , you know , Fred was so obsessed with that underwater house of his . Permit me to demonstrate , sir . - Yeah . - You see the HOD can move across the ocean bottom on these treads . And each 24 hours , it will dredge in and process 7 tons of sand and earth . Sand ? Well , the raw materials are sucked through here and filtered , you see . The slag is ejected back here , and the valuable residue is retained . Valuable residue ? Well , T.R. , as you well know , on the ocean floor , there are large quantities of gold , uranium , magnesium and other precious metals . Gold . Uranium . Magnesium . Mel has already constructed the full-size model . All we need is your okay to put it into operation . Well , you have it . You have it . Is this a working model ? Working model ? Yes , sir . Would you like me to demonstrate ? By all means . My door and my mind are always open . Gold . Uranium- - Here , here , here ! You 're sucking the tie ! Stop it ! Like your own habits . Thanks , honey . You have habits that are diurnal , back and forth- - - Daddy , do you want more ? - No , thanks . Yes , Dad . " Kelp " yourself . Kelp ? See , Dad ? It 's kelp . So " kelp yourself . " What a brilliant son you have . Daddy , as soon as I wash the dishes , can we work on our new song ? - Go ahead , honey . I 'll help Mother . - Thank you . Hey , Harold , do you have an inspiration yet ? Not yet , but I 'm working on it . Why don 't we do that number about the hippie who tries to get work in a fruit stand- - Hey , look at the goldfish . That 's not a goldfish . Well , it 's gold , isn 't it ? Forget it , Marvin , and concentrate on an idea , please . Come on , what 's wrong with that idea ? I mean- - Tommie , that 's not gonna work . Every time we think of a song , you bring up that stupid thing . - It 's terrible . - He gets hung up about bananas . Cool it . I 've got it . I 've got it . Listen , just follow the rhythm . Groovy beat , huh ? Hey , little goldfish Where you goin ' to ? Little goldfish Let me swim along with you Pretty goldfish We could have a whale of a time Put your fin in mine The tide is in And it 's gettin ' dark out There might be a shark out But don 't worry I 'll hold you tight The starfish will shine so bright And everything will be all right Little goldfish Where you goin ' to ? Little goldfish Let me swim along with you Pretty goldfish We could have a whale of a time Put your fin in mine Where 'd you learn to carry on like that ? Well , I watched the children . Not enough . Little goldfish Where you goin ' to ? Little goldfish Let me swim along with you Pretty goldfish We could have a whale of a time Put your fin in mine That was great ! T.R. to HOD . T.R. to HOD . Come in , Cheever . Come in , Cheever . Cheever here , sir . Reporting from the HOD . You got any gold yet ? Jonah and I were just setting up , sir . - Jonah ? - Yeah , my assistant . I thought the name was a good omen , you know , three days in the belly of the whale and all that . Yeah , that 's very amusing . Look , Cheever , I 'm counting on you and the HOD to make up for the money that Miller 's wasting on that idiotic house . You can depend on me , sir . You bring this off , Cheever , and I 'll give you Miller 's job . Head of research . Thank you , sir . - Over and out . - Roger , out . Jonah , did you hear that ? The boss is depending on me , and I 'm depending on you . You can count on me , sir . What 's that ? - It 's the alarm . We 've sprung a leak . - The children ? We 're taking on water . Get the girls into the sub . Wait , where are you going ? Come on , come on . One at a time , one at a time . Help , help ! Get her out ! Everything will be all right . Okay . I 've got a knee in the head . False alarm . False alarm . Everything 's under control . Hey , honey , you 're all wet . - Oh , really ? - You been taking a little dip ? You 'll laugh when you hear what happened . A seal got into our shower and turned on the water . A seal ? The water overflowed on the floor and tripped the alarm . Come on , let 's go see him . Well , at least we know the alarm system survived the test . Well , my nervous system didn 't . It 's been stripped , ganglia by ganglia . Like gears . Honey , I 'm going to bed . Dry off and join me . What ? Oh , shut up . Breakfast is ready , Fred . No , Gladys , I 'm not cooking your breakfast . Go get your own . Go on . - Hurry up and finish your breakfast . - Oh , you 're a pig . Dad , can we go scuba diving today ? - Yeah , I suppose so . - Groovy . Can you come with us ? No , I have to go collect specimens from the sea bottom . - You kids wanna help me ? - No . - More coffee , Harold ? - Yes , please . Can I help you , Daddy ? Gladys , I can 't play now . I don 't have time to play with you now . - Hi , Mom . - Hi , hon . Hi , Gladys . Excuse me , Gladys . Let 's see . There it is . - What 's next , Mommy ? - Boys ' room . - Okay . - Okay ? Mother , what are we gonna do about dinner tonight ? - Is- - ? - What ? What 's Gladys looking at ? Oh , she thinks it 's a TV set . Maybe she 's watching Mutiny on the Bounty . Yeah . Mr. Cheever . There 's something you ought to know . Yeah ? I don 't know , somehow all the air got out of this thing . - " Somehow , " huh ? - Yeah . I guess I didn 't have the bib on tight enough . We need that compressed air ! Now I suppose I 'll just have to surface for it . Or maybe I 'll just borrow some from a neighbor . Who ? Never mind . Vacuum , vacuum . Funny-looking vacuum . I guess this is it . Mommy , the house is tilt- - ! Give me a hand , kids . Hey , Mr. Miller . Are we all right ? - Yeah . - Okay . - Everything gonna be okay ? - What happened , Daddy ? Somehow we lost pressure in pylon three . I don 't know how . I reinflated it . - Here . - Where 's your mother ? She said she 'd be in her bedroom . Her bedroom ? Everything 's under control . You 're not gonna need this anymore . You 're right . Because I 'm going home . Aw , Viv . You know I made a commitment to T.R. " But , Viv , you know I made a commitment to T.R.

All you thought about was your project . - Oh , sweet- - - Don 't touch me . - Viv , sweetheart , you- - - Don 't you touch me . Oh , what 's the use ? Can 't make you stay . I 'll just call T.R. and tell him the whole thing 's a flop . Oh , all right , I 'll stay . - Oh , Viv . - But not for your sake . For the sake of our children . And don 't touch me . - I love you . - Stay out of the fun zone . - Sweet- - - I said I 'd stay , but no dividends . - Baby . - You want me to act like a fish ? All right , I will . A cold fish . Glub , glub . - Glub , glub , glub . - Very funny . Don 't do that . Oh , man , I want you to blow every tube in that crazy brain machine . Turn it on , baby , and we all make the gig .

Ciao . Yes , I can love you Yes , I can love you Baby I can love you - I can love you - Kids , please . Kids , please . You 're driving me out of my mind . Why can 't you play something nice for a change ? - Like what , Daddy ? - I don 't know . Something- - Something with some melody and heart . Something your mother and I can relate to .

Just one more chance To prove it 's you alone I care for Each night I say A little prayer for Just one more chance Just one more night To taste the kisses That enchant me I 'd want no others If you 'd grant me Just one more chance I 've learned the meaning Of repentance Now you 're the jury At my trial I know that I should Serve my sentence Still I 'm hoping all the while You 'll give me Just one more word I said that I was glad To start out But now I 'm back To cry my heart out For just one more chance Oh , I 've learned the meaning Of repentance Now you 're the jury At my trial Hey , chief . - What is it ? - Look at that . - What is that ? - You tell me . - Submarine ? - Well , if it is , it ain 't one of ours .

Really grabs you here , doesn 't it ? Well , I 'll say one thing , Mr. Miller . It really turns me off . Thank you , Marvin . It 's gone . Just like that . So ? Well , whatever was making that sound must still be there . Yeah , stands to reason . It must be some new gizmo . One of them anti-sonar blanketing devices . Has our side got anything like that ? No . I better report this to the captain . Have you heard from Cheever lately ? He called four days ago and said the HOD was functioning perfectly . I 'm gonna call him and see how much gold he 's collected . T.R. to HOD . T.R. to HOD . Come in , Cheever . Cheever here , sir . How much gold have you collected ? We 'll give you a full report in a day or two , sir . Briggs is here with me . He thinks you ought to have a bonus . - You know what I 'm gonna do ? - No . What , sir ? Cut that piddling salary of yours and give you 1 percent of all the gold that you dredge up . Oh , that 's just great , sir . Keep up the good work , son . You 're on my team . Over and out . Over and out . You know , with all the sand we 've been digging up , maybe we can make a deal with a construction company . Shut up and get back to work . - But , Mr. Cheever- - - Out , out , out .

Chief , get me Admiral Sheridan at the 6th Naval District Headquarters . - Aye , aye , sir . - Secret weapon . Yes , sir . - What 's wrong ? - Fred , a shark in that window . - And that one too . - We 're surrounded . - Oh , Fred , I 'm frightened . - Me too , Daddy . Did someone expel garbage without incinerating it ? I don 't know . Make them go away . Don 't worry . Harold . The main thing is not to frighten the girls . Just keep playing . Like the orchestra was playing when the Titanic sunk . I dig . - What 's that ? - It 's a squeeze buoy . Well , what 's a squeeze buoy ? It contains a chemical that attracts sharks . That 's all we need . More sharks . This floats to the surface and attracts them up there , away from the house . Hey , little goldfish Where you goin ' to ? Little goldfish Let me swim along with you Pretty goldfish We could have a whale of a time Put your fin in mine Now watch the ports . They 'll all be lured up to- - The chemical 's falling down around the house . Well , what does that mean ? Mommy ! Honey . They 're smashing the ports . It 's the chemical on the glass .

That was predictable . And perhaps benign . Will you speak English ! - She means like mellow , gassy , neat . - Just as I suspected . The correlation index of this musical number is 1.27 . 1.27 ? Oh , doctor , I think you have been smoking my bananas . This number should outsell everything Stentorian Records ever published . 1.27 ! - 1.27 . - 1.27 . - Dig that ? - I dig that . I shall be the first boy billionaire . Mildred . Get me Merv Griffin . At the Diplomat . We shall make a million copies of the first record . " Hey , Little Goldfish " with Harold and His Hang Ups . Goldfish ? - Sam and His Submarines . - How about The Green Onion ? I don 't know about that . Merv ? Yeah . Hey , listen . You know that gig you offered me on next Saturday 's show ? I 'll take it . A new , positively guaranteed , computer-tested hit . Yeah . The Green Onion . That 's the name of the group . Yeah . Can they make rehearsal ? You know it . Bye . What a promo . What a promo . Coast-to-coast debut on The Merv Griffin Show . - Mr. Ashbury , they can 't . - Can 't what ? - Can 't make it . - Make what ? Make the rehearsal . Or be on the show either . - You have flipped . - They 're out of town . - Out of town ? - Way out . - Where ? - I can 't tell you . - Do something . - Me ? What ? - Torture her . - Mr. Ashbury . Mr. Ashbury , I think I can get a message to them . - A message ? - I hope . A message . Well , if all you can do is get them a message , - get them a message . - Get them a message . Yeah , yeah , yeah . - You 'll hear from me . - Good . - Ciao . - Ciao . - Mr. Ashbury , with so much at stake- - - Silence . Reilly . Nate Ashbury . Can you see the lobby from your office ? Yeah . An old chick with a bilious green coat is on her way down . Oh , Reilly , check the whereabouts of some cat called Fred Miller . Works for some freak outfit called Underseas Development . What 's the subject doing , Philo ? Looks to me like she- - Now wait , wait . We don 't want appearances , Philo . - We just want the facts . - Yes , sir . She 's throwing something into the water .

Come in , Cheever . Come in , Cheever . No answer . Better try Miller . T.R. to Miller . T.R. to Miller . Go ahead , T.R. You 're over near Jawbone Reef , aren 't you , Miller ? Yes . Why ? Well , Cheever 's been doing some underseas dredging for me , and I can 't seem to rouse him on the radio . I wonder if you could swim over there and- - Why didn 't I know about this dredge ? Because you 've been spending so much time on your silly house . While you 've been bankrupting the company , Cheever 's been dredging up tons of gold . That isn 't all he 's been doing . Never mind that , just check on him , and when you get back , I want you to prepare your family to evacuate . - Evacuate ? Why ? - Why ? There 's a hurricane coming . Yeah , I know that . I made some underwater tests this morning . I was just about to go out to make some more . So what ? - Nothing to worry about . - So what ? That hurricane will tear your house down . I want your family up here where it 's safe . - Fred . - Hold on just a minute , T.R. There 's nothing to worry about . There 's no danger down here , believe me . Fred , I 'm terrified . A hurricane down here . - Nothing , dear . - I 'm scared . Okay , honey . I 'll get you out of here . All right , T.R. , you win . We 'll evacuate . Of course I win . Don 't I always ? Now , after the hurricane , I want that house torn down . I mean , after all , you didn 't spend 30 days down there , did you ? No , Mr. Hollister . We haven 't stayed 30 days yet , but we 're going to . Mrs. Miller ? Vivian ? Don 't you understand there 's a hurricane ? So ? Who 's afraid ? I mean , if my husband says we 're safe , then we 're safe . - So goodbye , Mr. Hollister . - Oh , Viv . No old hurricane 's gonna wreck my husband 's career . - Honey , you 're trembling . - But I 'm bravely trembling . Glub Glub , glub I 'm floatin ' on a sea of love Glub Glub , glub I 'm floatin ' on a sea of love - Hey , people , look at that . - Hey , it 's Duke . Hi , boy . Hey , he brought something . Thank you . Hey , what do you got ? - Let 's see . Open it up . - It 's a note . - A note ? - Yeah . It 's from Myrtle Ruth . Where you going , Daddy ? I gotta see a man about a wrench . - What are we gonna do ? - The Merv Griffin Show . Groovy . The chance of a lifetime and we 're stuck down here . Bye , Daddy . Do you suppose Myrtle Ruth told Mr. Ashbury where we are ? She 'd never tell . I 'll never tell . - I 'll never tell . - Never ain 't forever , baby . Okay , Reilly , show them in . Mrs. Webster ! Mr. Webster ! Myrtle Ruth , if you don 't tell us where Harold and Marvin are , we 're going to the police . Oh , Mr. Ashbury . That 's dirty pool . That 's show biz . Hey , listen , chickie . We can be back in , like , two hours . But how do we know Mr. Griffin will let us tape our part of the show ? Well , we can ask him , can 't we ? Oh , Mom won 't hear us . She 's in the bedroom . I don 't know if you can operate the submarine , Harold . - He 's a real good motorcycle driver . - Right . What 's the difference except it has no wheels ? This sub is smaller than the one Dad drove . Which means it 's easier . All right . I 'll leave a note for Mom and Dad . - So far , so good , Harold . - This is the berries . - This is a- - - Look out , Harold . - Harold ! - What are you doing ? - Relax , relax . - What happened , Harold ? - Watch out , here we go again . - Everybody hold on . - Stop the shouting . - Straighten it out , Harold . - Where are we- - ? - Look out for the reef ! Stop shouting . You 'll use up all the air . - Watch where you 're going . - I 'm watching . Harold , we better go up . I think we 'll be safer there . - All right . Okay . - Yeah . I am completely surrounded by nincompoops . You are the biggest nincompoop of all . People bringing me their troubles . - I am not responsible . - Oh ? Well , I warn you , Mr. Hollister , we are going to sue you for $ 100,000 , for each hair harmed on my boys ' heads . And if there is one thing those teenyboppers are loaded with , dad , it is hair . This must be Fred Miller 's fault . I had no idea he took your kids down there . Come on now , Little Orphan Annie , stop passing the buck . - We are laying this on you . - Briggs , do something . Mrs. Webster , I promise you we 'll have your boys out of there , and home safe and sound by dinnertime . Can you get the sub down there in weather like this ? Yes , sir . Directly from the submarine pen . Well , arrange it . Do I have to do everything ? - Yes , sir . I mean no , sir . - See what I mean ? - A complete nincompoop . - Well , well , well . Now , you see , the worst half is over . You mean there 's another half ? Stentorian Records is suing you for $ 5 million . - Five million dollars ? - Plus the court costs . Unless ... Unless what ? Unless , like well , all of us can make this scene together . I don 't know what that means , but let 's do it . Crazy , booby . Get me Merv Griffin , sweetie . - Harold . - Let me see where we are . - Hold steady , Harold . - I 'm trying . Close it . Take us back down ! Tommie , see if there are any towels in the back . - Yeah , give me one too . - All right . Get wet , Harold ? Harold , we 're heading for the bottom . - Do something .

Harold . - Harold , look out for those reefs ! - I can 't- - - We 're on the bottom . - We 've been zonked , friends . Hello . Hello . You 're gonna be all right . Just a second , now . Hold on . Just a second , Mel . Okay . Put your arm around me . Can you make it ? All right , here we go , now . Easy does it . Can anybody hear me ? Hello . Somebody . Somebody help me . - You 're gonna be all right . - Can anybody hear me ? - Can anybody hear me ? - Honey , what 's the matter ? Oh , Fred , look . I don 't know how to do that . My God . These kids can 't operate the submarine . - They 'll be killed . Honey- - - Main thing is don 't lose our heads . No . Calling the Coast Guard . Calling the Coast Guard . Mayday . Mayday . Hey . It 's Duke and Duchess . Go get Daddy . - Go get Daddy . - Lorrie , they can 't hear you . And even if they could , they wouldn 't understand . They understand we 're in trouble . - So they didn 't understand , huh ? - They understood . They 're gonna get us out of here . Mayday . Mayday . It 's no use . Reception is impossible in this hurricane . What are we gonna do ? - Fred , what are you gonna do ? - I 'm gonna hunt for the kids . I think they found them . Oh , do you really think so ? - I hope so . - My flippers . Darling , be careful . - Keep your fingers crossed , honey . - I will . Hey , little goldfish Where you goin ' to ?

The destroyer squadron reports the signal cut off . - Dead ? - Dead . Dead . Gentlemen . This is not to go beyond this room . But I must inform you that our side does not possess anti-sonar jamming gear that would function in this manner . - Captain . - Yes , admiral ? - Get me the Pentagon . - Aye , aye , sir . - We 're fine . - Okay , okay . - She 's all right . - Where did he go ? Where is he ? - Where did he go ? - I don 't know . - What 's he doing ? - I don 't know . - I can 't wait to get home . - I 'm not looking forward to explaining . Well , I hope Mommy 's not mad . I left a note . I 'll never get in another submarine as long as I live . It doesn 't matter . We 're alive . Here we come . Too late to worry about it now . - What ? What ? - Yeah , we can . - Louder . - We can .

Daddy , it 's not his fault . - It seemed like ten years to me . - It looks easy . Fred . Fred . Fred . Fred ? I want to thank you for saving me . Some guys would have just left me there . I have enough to be thankful for , Cheever , without worrying about you being thankful . Can I talk to you for a minute , Mr. Miller ? - Mr. Miller . - Not now , Harold . - It 's very important . - What is it , Harold ? The sub is sinking . It 's sunk . Oh , I know you 're upset about missing The Merv Griffin Show , but at least your song will be published . I don 't think so , Mommy . I have a terrible feeling Mr. Ashbury will never speak to us again . Well , ahoy . - Mr. Ashbury . - Look who 's here . Mr. Ashbury . - Get out of here . - Hey , how are you ? - Mr. Ashbury . - What happened ? - What are you doing here ? - How did you find us ? We 'd have more room down there if that fellow would get a haircut , I think . - T.R. - I tell you , heads will roll . This is the last time I go tourist . How dare you shanghai those Webster kids . Do you realize I am being sued ? I didn 't shanghai them , they came voluntarily . Let me tell you , you ignored orders to abandon this oversize fishing boat . I find your conduct irresponsible and culpable- - - Gassy . - And gassy . Gassy , that 's it . - Mrs. Miller . - Myrtle Ruth . It 's so good to see you . How is the book coming along ? Oh , I 'm writing a story about an underwater wife . Naturally . Oh , I 'm proud of you . - Did you like the song ? - Were you excited ? Cool it . Cool it . Oh , this pad is out of sight . - I will buy it . - But I 'm tearing this house down . I just bought it . You fill in the amount , I will sign it later . A new discotheque . Underwater yet . You know , Mr. Miller , you are almost as gassy a genius as I am . Can you throw together a few more of these pads , say in London , Paris , Rome , Stockholm ? - I haven 't signed the bill of sale yet . - Fellas , right over here . - You can 't come in here . - Right over here . Okay , kids . Now we are going to tape your Merv Griffin gig right here . - Right here ? - You know that is not the place for- - Who gave you permission to put my pad on national television ? - Now it is his pad . - Think of the publicity , Mr. Hollister . Yes , while the hurricane raged above , your underseas house survived , undamaged . By George , I 'm a genius . Yes , sir , I 'm a- - Cheever . Oh , hi , Mr. Hollister . Cheever where is my gold ? - Your gold ? - Yes . Is that all of it ? Well , except for my fillings , sir . Can somebody help me out of this thing ? - Hey , it 's Merv Griffin ! - In person , yet . - Merv , baby , where have you been ? - I had to get makeup for the filming . Come on . Follow me , I want you to meet your host . Mr. Griffith , I want to talk to you about a few things- - No autographs , daddio . Unhand the threads . Wait a minute . I 'm T.R. Hollister . I want to make sure that you plug my underwater house on your TV show . What are you , some kind of freak , or an establishment cop-out trying to get us uptight ? What 's this communist trying to say ? He just can 't figure out whether you 're crazy , or if you 're just a dull bore trying to give us a hard time . - I 'm not a dull bore , Mr. Griffith . - Fin . - What ? - Fin . - What does that mean ? - Look . T.R. , I am here to plug this marvelous group . I am not here to dispense free plugs for this fishy underwater pad of yours . Fishy underwater pad !

 What sounds like a fairy tale today , may be tomorrow 's reality . Here 's a fairy tale from the day after tomorrow . There are no more nations . Only humanity and its colonies in space . Distant stars have been settled . The ocean beds are inhabited . Space ships cross the galaxy at unimaginable speeds . One such ship is the Orion . A small link in a great chain of defense against threats from space . Let 's join Orion and her crew on patrol at the edges of infinity ... 3 . Guardians of the Law Subtitles by Anders M Olsson The robots of the Alpha-CO series are laborers or soldiers . They are controlled by programs and the three laws of robotics . May I have your attention , please ! You expect that an expert is always at hand to remember all the laws of robotics that you 've forgotten . But what if the expert fails to show up ? You 're at the mercy of robots if the program goes out of control . What a show-off . Remember Alpha 21 ? A group of robots damming up water . They went on until the entire colony drowned , and in the absence of the expert , no one knew how to change the program . You simply delete one of the tracks ... Too bad you weren 't there to fix it . Please pay attention ! Once more : The robots of the Alpha-CO series are laborers and soldiers which are controlled by programs and the three laws of robotics . The laws of robotics are important . The first law : A robot must never kill a human . That 's nice to know . Even though they think logically , their brains may get out of sync . Here 's an average worker robot . We 've introduced a minor error for the purpose of demonstration . The tapes are in disorder . It 's like a cybernetic neurosis . It 's standing paralyzed on a magnetic platform . The second robot is normal . ZR 3184 , approach the control panel ! Stop ! ZR 3184 , approach the control panel ! Switch off the platform for RX 2714 ! RX 2714 , stop ! RX 2714 , stop ! - Now let 's see what you know ! - Afraid of a robot ? The built-in controls allows adjustment of the basic reflexes . Watch closely how to correct the magnetic tapes ! Pay attention for your own sake ! Alright ... Commander , you 're wanted by the Space Patrol . It 's urgent ! The executives have a very limited vocabulary . " Urgent , secret , important ! " Come on guys ! Even a minor change of the tapes can cause severe damage . Careful , or your eyes may fall out ! Don 't we have blinders for him ? No , but the entire female corps will be replaced by robots . Including yourself ? Didn 't you know I 'm an epsilon android ? Watch it , or I 'll take you apart to see what 's wrong ! Commander McLane ! Urgent orders from the general . Can 't I even see him ? He 's at an intergalactic staff meeting . You 'll have to make do with Spring-Brauner . Oh my goodness . Not that bootlicker . - So where are we going ? - For you : The Horse Head Nebula . Thanks ! But you 're only going to sector 12-M-8 . For what purpose ? I thought we were here to take training . Collection of space probes with astrophysical data . And don 't forget to call back when you 're there . I 'll call on you when we get back . Please do , Commander . Have a nice trip ! I second that ! Typical ! Don 't you think I know who came up with this stupid mission ? It 's a job for cadettes . Major , you 've been demoted to patrol duty . You can 't complain . Now , you 'll have to excuse me . Base 104 , Orion 8 ready for launch . Countdown minus 180 . At minus 150 , blockage of Sirius 12 and Erida 8 . Clear the base ! Orion 8 , once you 're space born follow the route Earth Orbital Station 1 - Jupiter 1 - Hyperion 29 . Earth Station 4 to satellite 166 via lightwave : Orion passing through sector 47-2-32 . Jupiter 1 to Mars relay A1 . Orion leaving the control area . No deviation . Commander to engineering : Engines off ! Understood ! - And come up here , Hasso ! - Will do ! We 're at our destination . Relative velocity 0 . Captain 's log : Orion at destination . Generators and engines off-line . You look pale . - Since when do you care about my health ? - I 'm sincere . There are our targets . Let 's get it over with ! Next time , let 's transport garbage ! We 're going to extract data from 16 probes . Atan and Helga go first . Probes 1 through 8 . Launch channel 1 ! You 'll be out there for 19 hours . Hasso , float shaft 1 ! Mario , check zenith-distance and approach trajectory for shuttle 1 ! Commander , let me go out there and help out too ! - Do you have experience ? - No , but ... There you go . Go to bed ! That 's an order . Cliff - - Something 's out there : 18-M-106 . - Detectors on ! Looks like an old cargo-ship . Wish them a pleasant journey ! Then go to bed ! You 're on in 19 hours . - Cliff , shuttle 1 ready . - Away with it ! I 'm coming , I 'm coming ... Cliff , the unknown ship hails us . Hello Orion , hello Orion . Calling the Orion ! Orion here , we read you . This is the officer on duty aboard the freighter Sik 12 . My commander wishes to speak to you . Please turn on your screen ! Commander McLane here . Who 's your boss ? Commodore Ruyter . Really ? Ruyter ? I served under him as an ensign . That 's a long time ago . I bet you 're too good for us . Hello Commodore , what a surprise ! Cliff , my boy , I sure was lucky to find you . We 've got to talk . I transport ore from Pallas to Earth - germanicum . Four trips a year . Secret of course . - Lovely job . - Don 't mention it ! On Pallas there are 70 colonists and 21 robots . Landing is too difficult so they simply launch the ore in rockets that we pick up . Guess what was in the rockets when we got back to Earth ? Spoils and waste . Not a single grain of ore . Imagine the reaction at Space Command . What could I have done ? I had no contact with the colony . It was the second time around . In the past they used to come up to the ship to say hello . - Do you understand ? - I do . We didn 't see them this time either ! But the rockets arrive on schedule ? Yes , with absolute precision . But we can 't make contact . Strange . To say the least . Naturally , I 've filed a report . But the bureaucrats only care about the transport as such . I assume we 've got a shipment of waste once more . Take a look ! Can 't do . The rockets are magnetically attached to the hull . Unlike you , we 're not equipped for space-walks . How can I help ? In the old days , you 'd already be on your way to Pallas ! Alright , Commodore . I 'll take care of it . Over and out ! Call Helga and Atan and brief them ! We 'll make a detour to Pallas . And inform our lady from Secret Service ! With pleasure ! You 're always up to mischief . - Now listen ... - No ! My job is to see to it that you stick to the rules . I 've had enough ! I 'll report you if you leave your position . People may be in danger on Pallas . That 's the responsibility of Space Command . Space Command doesn 't seem to be interested . Disciplinary actions will be taken if they find out that we 're no longer in sector 12-M-8 . Not a bad idea ! Orion calling shuttle 1 . Yes , what 's up ? Greetings from Laurin ! OK , will do ! No one will notice anything ! One moment . Hasso ? Greetings from Laurin ! We 'll do a little trick . Shubashi will use the shuttle to set up a forcefield the size of our ship , a so called Laurin . All sensors will record our presence in sector 12-M-8 . - That 's fraud . - Yes it is . - Hello Orion ? - Yes . Laurin 's up ! Great ! Thanks , Atan ! Just don 't get caught ! I don 't fancy a new commander . Don 't worry ! We 'll be back within 12 hours . Commander to engineering , full speed ahead ! Try again ! We must get in touch with the Orion ! I 'm doing my best . Mars relay A1 is in constant connection with training fleet 18 . Trying via Hyperion 29 ... Less talk ! It 's an alpha order for McLane . Abort mission and return to Earth ! Hyperion 29 here , satellite 116 has ordered a response from the Orion . No response ! Nothing but trouble with McLane . He 's been ordered to return . If he 's left the sector , he 'll be charged . Enough is enough ! Yes , but he 's on the sensors . The scans can 't be wrong . Orion stands still at RS18 and 12 in the satellite field . Mario , call them ! We 're approaching Pallas . Orion 8 calling Pallas ! Orion 8 calling Pallas ! Pallas come in ! Orion 8 under Commander McLane calling Pallas ! Pallas come in ! They must be asleep . Or drunk . Pallas come in ! Pallas come in ! Hello Pallas , requesting landing coordinates and a guide beam ! Calculate the orbit , we 'll do some loops ! Sooner or later they must respond . Orion 8 calling Pallas ! Orion 8 calling Pallas ! Pallas , why don 't you respond ? Never mind , Mario . We 'll land on our own . Is an unassisted landing more difficult ? Only more intricate . Engineering , impulse down to 6 ! Mario , altitude and velocity ! Altitude 93,000 . Velocity 1739 . Alright , down we go . - Listen closely ! - I always do . I don 't know what 's going on . But the Orion must be on stand by while we 're looking for the colonists . How long can you keep the converters idling ? 18 hours . Any longer and they go up in smoke . No more ? Only five minutes more will melt down the crystals . - But 18 is safe ? - No 16 - by the book . - 18 it is . - You 're the boss . - Ugh , it 's raining . - Yes , don 't be a ninny ! Don 't they have weather control ? Yes , but who knows what 's going on . A large station and a hearty welcome , right ? - You might say that . - What did you expect ? At least a welcoming committee . A red carpet around the ship . Two large laurels , a curtsying flower-girl . And a singing choir . Are you finished , Mario ? No , but I 'll shut up for you . Calling Pallas HQ . This is Commander McLane of the Orion . We 've just landed . Please let us into your tunnels ! Commander McLane calling Pallas HQ . Do you read ? Nothing . Hello ! Pallas HQ ! This is Commander McLane of the Orion . We 've just landed . Please let us into your tunnels ! Not a squeak . - May I try ? - Can you do better ? Maybe they 'll listen to the voice of a siren . OK , I 'll shut up . But where did Ruyter 's rockets come from ? Someone must have turned on the positioning controls . - Let 's investigate . - We can 't even find the entrance . We 're not going for a walk in this weather ? We are . You 'll have to cheer up , instead of worrying about your hairdo . Come on ! You 'll search within 500 meters on this side . The entrance can 't be far away . - Come along ! - Who stays here ? - No one , why ? - That 's against regulation . - Which one ? Paragraph 28 , section 2B . What a brilliant memory ! What does it say ? At makeshift landing bases , engines and armory must be constantly manned . Right . It 's your duty to point that out . Now , let 's forget about that and do what we must . My job is to see that you abide by the rules . Yes , I know . I 'm alive today only because of my bad memory for paragraphs . You can say that to General Wamsler or Colonel Villa ! So who stays at the ship ? By the book : Sigbjörnson , de Monti and me . And you go looking for the colonists . - What 's that supposed to mean ? - Like I said . What shall I tell your superiors when you don 't come back ? Are you putting me on ? The ship 's on standby . No one can access it . Why guard it ? In case of an emergency I 'll need you all . - Cliff , we 've found the entrance ! - I 'm coming ! But you may stay in compliance with paragraph 28 , section 2B . Mario . Hasso . - Hello ? - Is anybody home ? Hello ? Something 's not right . Perhaps they are playing a trick on us ? Hide and seek ? Beta . YX minus 700 . Gamma . AZ minus 6000 . YX minus 700 . Gamma A 1000 . Solar storm 97,000 and rising . The daily diagnostics . Always the same . Hello ! Where are you ? Someone must have turned on the diagnostics . It can run unattended for months . Looks like a disaster area . Do you see any debris ? Well ? Everything seems alright . Perhaps they are away on business . We 'll find them . Shouldn 't we inform Space Command ? Why ? Are you scared ? Looks good . Runs on automatic . Everything works alright . Oxygen supply normal . But someone must supervise the machinery . Hello ? Is anybody here ? - Did anyone exit ? - No . - Or enter ? - Neither . Perhaps they are all buried down there . We 'll go down when the elevator comes back . Cliff , it 's insane to enter a remotely controlled elevator . It can only go down . I recommend that we wait . Now ! Get in ! Androids , C-robots . What are they doing up here ? They should be working in the mine . And where are the colonists ? A mutiny by the robots ? That 's unheard of . Tamara , stand back ! Hasso , Mario , shoot when the door opens ! Just aim for their heads . Remember that they are machines . But they don 't take orders anymore . Robots can understand 2,000 commands and perform 1,000 simple functions . But they have no self-confidence . Reacting by logic , not reason . Watch out ! Halt , don 't shoot ! Drop your weapons , it 's of no use . He 's right , Cliff . Listen - my name is McLane . - Commander McLane ? - Yes . Have they been destroyed ? Easy ! What 's happened ? I 'm Richard Hall . We 've been here on Pallas for more than two years . Initially all went well , and the robots did their job . We settled in , sent the robots down in the mine , and a few months later , the first ore-carrying rockets were in orbit . - Then came the shooting . - Humans against robots ? No , the robots worked flawlessly . It was humans . Two people killed . And the motive ? A man by the name of Forrester smuggled Euphorine . Drugs . That 's the motive . - And ? - One month later ... You must understand that I 'm in charge here . Forrester and his people wouldn 't work anymore . And I 'm responsible . I had an argument with Forrester . The revolt that followed forced me to shoot Forrester and his companion . I had no choice . And suddenly the robots rose against us . - Where did you shoot the men ? - Here , in the mine . And the robots watched ? That 's the explanation . The first law of robotics ! A robot may never kill , but must preserve human life . And to prevent further damage , the robots took command . Yes . Since that day we work under the supervision of robots . Haven 't you tried to make contact ? Yes , but how ? We put notes under the ore . The ore never arrived . Only waste . Then we 'll stay here till we die . Go back to work , or they will come down here again . - Do they force you to work ? - Precisely . And it seems to work . Sounds like a fairy tale - robots as guardians of the law . So you have no idea ? It 's the second time your transport is full of waste , and you don 't know why ? - Do you want us to believe that ? - I don 't care what you believe . I take offense that you treat me and my crew like criminals . Your words , not mine . I can see that you 're making me your scapegoat . Yes , why not ? Here 's a nice little compilation of your starfleet career . What about the ship on Hermes 4 ? Just an old pile of junk that nobody cared about . But accusing me of embezzling two transports is gross slander . General Wamsler from Space Patrol wishes to speak to the director . What 's this supposed to mean ? Why wasn 't I informed ? He belongs to my jurisdiction , so I 'm in charge . Understood ? General , what gives us the honor ? Nothing unpleasant , I hope ? The overstepping of authority must cease . Ruyter is one of my most reliable officers . I didn 't know that you would personally deal with such trifles . It 's only about two lost shipments . Why all the fuss ? It 's a matter of principle . As you know , General , the space fleet should not investigate the mistakes of its own officers . What mistakes ? I haven 't done anything wrong . So you say that the colonists keep the ore for themselves , or that they don 't know the difference between ore and waste ? No , I only know that something 's wrong on Pallas . The colonists seems to have left . Why then do the rockets arrive on schedule ? What do I know ? Robots extract the ore on Pallas . The colonists don 't even touch it . So the robots are malfunctioning ? Humans make mistakes , robots don 't . And that 's a trait of the robot ? On the contrary : It 's a trait of the human . The human is controlled by her traits , the robot by its brain . Which we can control . Don 't tell me that a computer can 't break down . Of course it can , but out of two possibilities : Computer error or the human factor , the latter seems more likely . I really wish that your faith in machinery will one day be broken . Be careful what you wish for . Our entire society and safety depends on robots . I know . I wasn 't born yesterday . Thinking about that doesn 't exactly make me overjoyed . And concerning the waste : It will soon be cleared up . McLane is around . I 'll put him on the case . They are looking for McLane like a needle in a haystack . His energy field registers , but he doesn 't respond . An old trick . " Greetings from Laurin ! " I 'll deal with him ... - General ? - Yes ? Never mind . That would never have happened with a robot . Shuttle 1 calling Orion ! Why don 't you respond ? Hello Orion ! Orion ! Shuttle 1 here , Helga Legrelle . Cliff , where are you ? Cliff ! No response , Atan . - No response for two hours . - Easy ! - They may be in trouble . - Stop imagining things ! If there 's someone aboard , they would respond . Then there 's no one aboard . They wouldn 't leave the ship unmanned . I 'm sure they have a good time . Nice walks , a picnic . What do I know ? What if they 've been taken by force ... ? Sweetheart , you 're showing signs of space madness . I 'm afraid , Atan . Is there a chance , Cliff ? It depends on how much time we 've got . Time for what ? For thinking . Do you think that helps ? It 's the only way . Tamara , you know most about cybernetics . What goes on in the minds of the robots ? Programming errors . Codes in disorder . Can the robots change their own programs ? They seem to have forgotten their instructions . - How so ? - I don 't know , but ... - Do they follow orders at all ? - Not exactly ... - Or do they do the opposite ? - Yes , that 's it . Wait a moment , now I know . They sent waste instead of ore , didn 't they ? And they are not allowed to carry arms , but they do . Humans do the work of robots . Yes . The robots should obey us , but it 's the other way around . Their memories are upside down . - How could that be ? - There 's only one explanation . They 've been given conflicting orders . The entire program consists of zeros and ones , " yes " and " no " . Conflicting impulses may reverse the entire system . Probably during the shooting . The first and second laws of robotics at the same time . The first law , preserve human life could only be fulfilled by breaking the second law . That 's why we must reprogram them . Can you do that , Tamara ? - Don 't you have an on-site expert ? - That was Forrester . Wonderful . No one can get close to them anyway . Sure . The reversal . When do they come down here ? Irregularly . Some days we don 't see them at all . We can take advantage of their behavior . If we turn off the equipment , they will come to check . - Excellent . Is there a narrow passage ? - Yes , at the first crossing . Gather your men there ! Then we turn off the equipment to draw the robots . Once the robots are here , we 'll blow up the ceiling . The robots must not be crushed . They must only be immobilized so that we can reprogram them . - That 's enough . There 's no reply . - What do we do now ? The Laurin draws more power than we can generate . We have enough spare power . That 's what you think . Only 20 % is left . I trust Cliff . He 'll be here within 2 hours . That 's what he said . - He always keeps his word . - Perhaps he can 't make it . He always takes risks . They may have fallen into a trap . There are only colonists and robots on Pallas . Perhaps he needs help . Let 's turn off the Laurin and go to Pallas ! - We 'll wait . - For how long ? We 'll be out of power before you 've made up your mind . The Laurin will collapse and take us with it . We 'll vanish without a trace . How much left ? 8 percent . You 're killing us ! We 'll wait . Wait for my sign ! - Everybody in cover ? - Yes . The pressure wave will run through the main tunnel . If we succeed , what commands should we install ? Something to stop your stupid questions . They are coming ! What did Rott say when he opened that crazy robot ? " Just a minor change of tapes will correct the problem . " Yes , but how ? - It was a Y-setting . - But which one ? One mistake , and the robots will go berserk . Don 't you remember more ? Wasn 't it Y18 ? If so , did he reset it to 17 or 19 ? That 's where we left . If it was Y18 , then Y17 must be the normal position . Or Y19 , and then it goes mad at 17 . They are coming ! Take cover ! Now ! Get going ! It worked . Stay where you are ! Open the latch ! That breaks its connection with the other robots . Do you see the switches at the top ? The blue one is Y18 . - Do you have it ? - Yes , and then ? - It must be reset . - But to which position ? Y17 or 19 , you decide . 17 ! If I 'm wrong , we 'll all be wasted . Thanks . - When will the general arrive ? - At midnight . I 'm finished . Why can 't we reach the Orion ? We 've asked Commodore Ruyter . He says that he 's had radio contact with the Orion . Orion wished him a happy journey . We should be able to reach McLane too . Yes , we should . You didn 't expect all that trouble because of McLane , did you ? He won 't get away . Perhaps a rescue mission ? In space sector 20-L-34 , there 's the training fleet 18 that can be put to use . - They will find McLane . - No , for the love of God ! The fleet encompasses 22 battleships , 40 cruisers and 133 lesser ships . It 's your only hope to find McLane . Alright , then . I don 't have much choice . - Contact fleet 18 ! - Will do . They will soon be back . - Do you think we made it ? - No idea . God knows how they will behave . They are coming ! - Are your men ready , Hall ? - Yes , Major . - Ready ? - Ready . Let 's go up ! Quickly ! No one must get away . Hurry up ! How much power left ? 7 percent . We 'll have to turn off the Laurin . It 's of no use . It 's too late . Turn it off anyway , or the shields will collapse . - The heat 's unbearable . - Yes , be quiet . - How long will the shields hold up ? - Until Cliff picks us up ! Hello ? Orion ? Here 's shuttle 1 . Hello ? Orion ? Atan Shubashi to the log . Our entire energy reserve has been depleted . Our shields deteriorate due to cosmic radiation . Lieutenant Legrelle is unconscious . We 've got no radio contact with the Orion . Commander McLane doesn 't respond . End . We 've got a lot to tell when we get back . - They 'll never believe us . - Especially Atan . And neither will Lieutenant Legrelle , since I was there . - The ladies are really friendly . - Long as they do their job . Don 't know what we would have done without you . Was that a compliment ? I don 't believe my ears . Cliff , shouldn 't we go to hyperspace ? No , Hasso . Locator beam forward ! Reduce force field ! We 'll soon be there . Satellite area visible . Shubashi hails us ! Positioning ! Speed adaptation ! - Propulsion off ! - Will do , Major ! - Open the locks ! - Locks open ! Commander to engineering : Ready to take over ! Cliff , Cliff ... I can hear you . I can see you . - Is that really you ? - Why ? What did you think ? Is something wrong ? Atan , positioning ! What 's wrong , Atan ? What 's happened ? Say something ! - Take care of Helga ! - Is she unconscious ? The shuttle is on board . Helga is unconscious ! We need Mario to help carry her inside . - And Atan ... - Hurry up ! We 're coming ! Don 't worry , we made it . Fools . Fools . You 're right . Don 't think that we 've had a good time at your expense . You 're fools . It 's OK , Atan . Easy , I agree . What 's happened ? He thinks we 're fools , and I agree . - Is that all you know ? - He hasn 't told me anymore . Take Helga to the bridge ! Tamara will take care of her . Then come back here ! Now tell me what 's happened ! Out of oxygen ? Shields failing ? We ran out of power . The Laurin , I forgot . Us too . We wouldn 't have made it another second . Didn 't you switch off the Laurin ? That wasn 't our orders . You 're not a kid . You know what to do when things get rough . Just throw the blame on us . Only ashes would have been left . Burned up by the radiation . Why did you keep the Laurin ? We tried to hail you . You were gone , and evidently you couldn 't reach us either . Sometimes you must act on your own to survive . Do you think we were much better off on Pallas ? Why didn 't anyone stay on board ? Here we go again . Yes , we might have been killed ! You were so self-absorbed that you forgot about us . Listen to that whiner ! - It 's not funny . - Not the least . Stop your squabbling ! Babies cry too , but first they get spanked . You should get a good spanking for such nonsense . Nothing wrong with detours , but this time you went too far . You 're right , Atan , but we couldn 't anticipate the problems on Pallas . Hasso , tend to your engines ! Can you walk to the bridge ? Yes . Just walk on ! Come on ! It 's too late to play hero . Do you feel better ? Fairly well . Was it rough ? I didn 't feel anything . - Atan wouldn 't do anything . - Good thing I didn 't listen to you . Stop your squabbling ! Turn on the autopilot and come up here ! - I 'm coming . - Thanks . Atan , pour us a drink ! We 've deserved that . Hasso , come on ! What do we drink to ? To the robots and to Y17 . Here 's to Laurin ! And to neglected space probes ! If Wamsler finds out where we 've been ... We 're in demand . At least 8 stations hail us . Calling the Orion , Commander McLane ! Calling the Orion , Commander McLane ! Yes , Orion and McLane here . We 've been trying to reach you for more than 20 hours . - I can 't believe it 's really you . - I don 't understand . We 've been calling you for 20 hours . We haven 't noticed any problems . I 'm not here . The staff of defense and Space Command have been very worried . Did you say worried ? I did , Commander . The entire training fleet is on its way searching for you . Why all the fuss ? To our shame we must admit that Space Patrol has given wrong orders . The mission wasn 't for the Orion , but for the training ship Arion . What 's the occasion , McLane ? I 'd really like to know . Nothing special . Quite a feast for no occasion . Lieutenant Jagellovsk ? Don 't you have anything to report ? No . Something you haven 't told Secret Service ? Can 't think of anything . Great . Then you haven 't said too much . Don 't give yourself away ! Who was responsible for the incorrect order ? - Do you really want to know ? - Is it a secret ? You 'll like it . Spring-Brauner . Cliff , let 's invite him ! I 'm sure he 'd like that . - A brilliant idea ! - He 's away on a mission . Now have a good rest ! Do you know your next mission ? No , General . Orion leaves on the day after tomorrow . You 're going to bring 40 C-robots to the Venus colony . We can refuse to do that . On what grounds ? The ships of the Space Patrol aren 't approved for transports . I can apply for an injunction . I wouldn 't do that if I were you . Good connections must be put to use . Does Laurin ring a bell ? In what context ? Greetings from Laurin ! Oh , yes we 've heard of that . We 'll be happy to carry out the transport . Thanks for your offer , Lieutenant , but I don 't mind robots . Here 's to the tin-men !

 Destroy All Monsters United Nations Science Committee Space Port II The 10th century is nearing its end . The UNSC has established an exploration base on the moon . Rockets depart for it every day from this base on Iwo Jima . Moonlight SY-3 ready for takeoff . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one , zero ! The UNSC has also constructed a giant undersea farm in the vicinity of the Bonin Islands . All manner of fish are cultivated here , and on the surface is Monsterland , a research habitat of fearful giant monsters . Godzilla is there . Along with Rodan . Anguirus is also present . Mothra and Gorosaurus live in peace here as well . If they attempt to leave , it activates a restraint system . In other words , a variety of scientific walls tailored to their instincts and traits contains them . The reason Rodan can 't fly beyond a set boundary at sea is that a perimeter of magnetic barriers has been set up . Moreover , enough food is cultivated here for the monsters that they can each eat their fill . Monsterland and the undersea farm are controlled automatically from a control center built deep underground . Yes , CHX should work fine . Everything is in order . Don 't the monsters look rather cute from above ? Yes , very . That 's a relief . I feared you 'd run away , this being your first encounter . Oh no . I hope you 'll help us as we closely study them . Yes , sir . Long-distance call for Kyoko Manabe . Please go to box 4 . Hi . Oh , Katsuo ! Where are you now ? The moon base . This is an expensive call . Yeah . I was worried when I heard . But I 'm doing fine , as you can see . I 'm not worried about you . I 'm worried about how you 'll treat Godzilla . Oh . As it turns out , a monster lives on the moon too . Really ? Just joking . We 're not sure what it is , but we 're concerned . I 'd like Dr. Yoshida to come . The director is in Tokyo for a conference . Then once he 's back ... Hello ? Hello ? What 's wrong ? Hello ! Hello ! Power station ! Power station ! This is the operator . Power station , what 's wrong ? We have no idea . Look , every control system is down . Inconceivable . Perform a thorough systems check . How 's the incident-analysis circuit ? It 's not running ! What happened ? I don 't know . Doctor ! It 's gas ! Come on , this way ! Having suddenly lost contact with Monsterland , the UNSC in Tokyo immediately launches an investigation headed by Dr. Yoshida , using communication satellites . Number 006 is now showing the Bonin Islands . Zoom in . Yes , sir . We can 't . We 're still being jammed . Try again . Don 't give up . This is deliberate sabotage . Deliberate sabotage ? But who ? And why ? Doctor , we got through . That 's Monsterland , but I hardly recognize it . Did new volcanic activity cause this ? I doubt it . Zoom in more . Yes , sir . What 's happening ? What is that ? This was definitely a planned attack . I doubt any of our staff survived . This is the Moscow broadcasting office . This is an emergency broadcast . Rodan has attacked Moscow . Rodan ? At 11 : 25 AM today . It appeared above the city and is even now continuing its rampage of destruction . This must of course be the same Rodan from Monsterland on the Bonin Islands . Rodan is in Moscow ? What 's going on here ? This report is coming to you from Paris . A subterranean monster has just appeared from the Arc de Triomphe . The pride of Paris ... No , the world 's treasure is about to be destroyed by this monster . The monument is collapsing . It 's been destroyed . Paris is being destroyed by this subterranean monster . The world 's major cities are being destroyed one by one by giant monsters . Rodan is in Moscow , Mothra is in Beijing , Manda is in London , and Baragon is in Paris . We 've just received a new report . Godzilla has appeared in New York . Godzilla is in New York . How do you explain this , Doctor ? How did the monsters escape ? Weren 't they all contained before this ? Gentlemen , we regret that people suspect we are concealing information about these monster attacks . What about you , Dr. Yoshida ? All I can currently do is give a warning , as if this were a natural disaster . The monsters will keep rampaging , so everyone must remaim fully alert . Silence please ! What I mean is I 'm as ignorant as you right now . I have the same questions you do . I have no answers right now . One question , Doctor . Why hasn 't Tokyo been attacked when it 's closest to Monsterland ? I 'd very much like to know why myself . If anyone can tell me , please speak up . Moonlight SY-3 . Moonlight SY-3 ! This is Moonlight SY-3 , over . Return to base . Has something happened ? You 'll see . Hurry back . Hey ! Follow that ! Yes , sir . It won 't get away today . But we need to get back . This is more important . That 's a UFO out there . It 's dangerous to get any closer . What is that ? Moonlight SY-3 ! Moonlight SY-3 , what 's wrong ? Damn it . Go . This seems completely backwards . I don 't know what 's happened on Earth , but it 's absurd to ask us for help . They didn 't ask . What then ? It 's a recall order . We 'll guide you once you enter the atmosphere . You 'll land at Monsterland on the Bonin Islands . Proceed directly underground . Only you and your ship can do this job . And all of you should be armed . Armed ? Yes . Be very careful . Understood . Trajectory good . Receiving guidance beam . Roger that . Stand by for atmospheric entry ! Reverse thrusters , check . Entering atmosphere ! This is Moonlight SY-3 . We 've just arrived at the control-center entrance . Good . Someome may have commandeered it . Ascertain their identity and objective . Be careful . They may resist . Roger . No sign of radioactivity or sulfur dioxide . All right , let 's go . Look sharp . Yes , sir . Look ! Systems are up . What 's going on here ? Welcome . Kyoko ! Doctor ! Hello again . Why are you here ? I didn 't expect you to come . What 's all this about , Doctor ? Let 's relax and talk this over . We want you , our young scientists and engineers , to understand and cooperate . Cooperate ? Cooperate nothing . You let all the monsters free while Director Yoshida was away . They 're not running free . We have them under remote control . Remote control ? Take a look . Mothra is currently near Beijing . Godzilla is in the Pacific . Rodan is over the Urals . We can call them back to this island anytime we want . I 'll introduce you to the inventor of this remote-control system . Follow us . Welcome , gentlemen . I imagine you have lots of questions . I am not your enemy . With your help , I want to establish a new scientific civilization on this planet . How does destroying our cities establish anything ? You should listen to everything she has to say , Katsuo . Kyoko ! We will establish our new civilization . Some degree of sacrifice is unavoidable . What ? Where are you from ? Kilaak . Kilaak ? It 's not on Earth . There are countless asteroids between Mars and Jupiter . She 's from one of them . You believe that story ? Belief doesn 't matter . I admire her scientific knowledge and creativity . It should be obvious from the monster remote-control system . Her science is far superior to ours . Okada , stand down ! Now do you see ? That barrier is completely unbreakable . What are you doing ? Getting you out of here . Where 's everyone else ? They 're all well , and happy to keep working . Call them . Don 't you see ? It 's no use resisting . All right , fine . We 'll just take you two with us for now . We 'll carry you out if we have to . Now walk ! Gas ! Hurry ! Stop right there ! What are you doing ? Get off me ! Hurry ! It 's closing ! Hurry it up ! Move ! Captain ! C 'mon . Hurry up ! We have masks ! Don 't let her escape ! Take him to the ship ! Yes , sir ! Kyoko ! Kyoko ! Captain ! Captain ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Captain ! Captain ! Captain ! Okay , let 's move ! Was it brainwashing ? Is that what they did to you ? You 're not giving us any answers to our questions . Listen , Otani . The only way we can help is if you answer . Don 't you get that ? " I don 't know " isn 't good enough . Major cities are still being destroyed ! We sent in some UN troops , but the island was already deserted . Where 's their new base ? Please , tell me . We can 't continue to hide you from the UN 's secret police . Our friendship won 't make any difference to them . What shall we do ? Doctor ! Hands off . It 's you ! Are you Kilaak underlings now ? You 'll understand soon enough . We 've come to get you . You too . There 's no point in moving him now ! Stay still . We should handcuff him . It 's the secret police . Retreat . We need to go ! Halt ! Scalpel . Was he hard of hearing ? No . Then it isn 't a hearing aid . It 's some kind of metal I 've never seen . There must be some kind of radio receiver inside it . But why was there a receiver implanted in his body ? Doctor . Isn 't this how they 're controlling the monsters ? I agree . Dr. Otani was being controlled the same way . Yes . They came to get him for fear we 'd find this . There must be a transmitter somewhere . If we can detect the signal , we can jam it . Contact the commumications lab . I 'll search from the air . This signal 's fishy . Figure out where it 's coming from ! Yes , sir . It 's coming from Japan 's central mountain region . Look , I 'm busy . However rare this is , I don 't have time to look into it . Yeah , but still ... Officer ! Something 's flying up there . Over there . Where ? There ! It 's that ! What is that ? R-Rodan ! No , it 's not . Let me see . Over there ! That 's the moon rocket SY-3 . SY-3 ? We went to the moon with Takeshi that time . That 's right . Is he doing well ? Yeah . Can I help you ? We 're investigating a signal . Go right ahead . Excuse us . What 's that ? It 's a radar . Please observe this object , which appears to be a stone . The UNSC has confirmed it as the Kilaak monster-control device wreaking havoc upon our world . What 's more , they 're being discovered in the most unexpected places . The cliffs of Dover . The steeple of a church in Spain . One appeared to be a clump of ice in a ravine in the Alps . One was even discovered in a coconut on Guam . Dr. Yoshida will now explain its capabilities . This is a transceiver with an incredibly complex computer built in . We estimate its effective broadcast range to be about 2,000 km . So the monsters are likely being controlled by devices in their respective areas . Regarding the Kilaaks and their prisoners from Monsterland ... They 've likely returned to their countries to carry out their plans . We ask for everyone to assist us so we can find them quickly . Former Monsterland technicians Mimoru Kudo , age 35 . Tetsuo Ise , age 30 . Shin Kuroiwa , age 28 . Kyoko Manabe , age 23 . All Japanese citizens . Technician Michael Dawson , age 32 , British citizen . Elmer Hughes , age 19 . Thank you , miss . You can go . We beg your pardon . Thanks , you can go . Excuse us . Thanks , you can go . Please take shelter ! Rodan is circling over areas VII and VIII . It 's finally come to this . The evacuation seems smooth . It does . New target sighted . Godzilla has appeared in area I. What ? Manda ! Manda has appeared . Prepare to attack . Prepare to attack . All right . Open fire . I didn 't expect Tokyo alone to stay safe , but Rodan , Godzilla , and Manda all at once ? Indeed . New York , London , Moscow ... It 's been one monster for each city till now . Emergency update , emergency update . Mothra has appeared in area V. Integrated Defense Headquarters Liaison Conference Center We really got hit hard . Tokyo is in ruins . There were four monsters . But the Kilaaks are more interested in the Izu peninsula . Izu ? We 've lost contact with merely every hot spring in Izu . Just like what happened at Monsterland . Do we have proof the Kilaaks are behind it ? There 's a subterranean monster at Amagi . Baragon ? Do you know why every major city except Tokyo was attacked in the first place ? They were diverting our attention from Japan while they set up a base under Izu . No wonder . They must be using a new control device now . Yes , and we must locate exactly where they are . I want you to perform a focused underground survey with your SY-3 . Then find a breach we can launch a subterranean attack through . Good to see you again . Thank you , Doctor . Good to see you . It 's Kyoko Manabe . Why are you here ? Let 's talk elsewhere . No , I want to talk to all of you here . I know what you have to say . Don 't tell me again ! Even if you don 't want to hear it , the others will . Especially the reporters . Where did you come from ? From the Izubase . What base is that ? A base the Kilaaks established as a foothold on Earth . You 're here as their messenger ? Yes. lf you recognize their residency rights and negotiate toward coexistence and coprosperity , they will return all the monsters to the Bonin Islands . Amd if we don 't , they 'll destroy us with the monsters . That 's coercion , not negotiation ! I 'm talking to everyone here . You be quiet . Come here . What are you doing ? Calm dowm ! You 're being manipulated ! Stop fighting me ! Doctor ! She was being controlled with these . They controlled the Monsterland employees and monsters , and killed Dr. Otani with this . Doctor . This is another new type . We 'll investigate them immediately . Kyoko ! Kyoko , wake up ! Kyoko ! Good , you 're awake . It 's me . We 'll get you patched up in no time . It 's all right . Miss Manabe , this is urgent . We need you to tell us about the Kilaaks and where you 've been . Kilaaks ? That 's right . In which part of Izu is their base ? I ... I ... Yellow poison gas ! She has no memory of when she was being controlled . All right then . Now entering target zone I ! Ground troops are in position ! Okay . Prepare to attack . Here we go , men ! Yes , sir ! SY-3 has begun its decent ! Good . Godzilla 's in our landing zone ! Halt descent ! Emergency ascent ! Emergency ascent ! Emergency ascent ! All right . Open fire ! Hey , what 's wrong ? We 're being jammed ! It 's Anguirus ! What ? Damn ... Operations halt ! Operations halt ! Damn it . Back to base . What a shame . They outwitted us again . Hey . Do we follow ? Yeah . It 's descending near Mt . Fuji . Looks like it 's tied to the Kilaaks . Determine where it 's landing . Yes , sir . Rodan 's behind us , 15 degrees to our left ! Captain , running away sucks . Let 's fight back . It 's not time yet . It won 't follow us where there 's no air . Prepare to leave atmosphere ! Preparing to leave atmosphere ! Main engine , full throttle ! What an escort Rodan makes . Now we 've lost our target . No , we have a rough idea . I 'm sure they 'll find the Kilaak access point if they search all over Mt . Fuji 's western side . Advance ! Keep advancing ! Third platoon , keep advancing ! Godzilla ! S-Spread out ! Spread out ! Fan out ! First platoon , take the left forest road ! Second platoon , to the right ! Third platoon , follow second platoon ! This way ! What 's wrong ? Get up ! You okay ? I 'm all right . Let 's go . Must go pretty deep . Let 's go in . Damn it ... It won 't budge . I bet it 's a Kilaak cave . Our only choice is to move forward . All right . Okay , get back . I 'll shoot it . It 's no use . It 's good to see you again , Mr. Yamabe . Welcome , Major Tada of Defense Command . We summoned you here today on important business . Summoned ? I knew it . They 're here , all right . That 's them ! Yes , that was our spaceship you saw on the moon . Do you believe now that we 're aliens ? So what 's the important business ? A proclamation . Proclamation ? Please listen carefully , Major Tada in particular . Earth doesn 't belong to humans alone . The area beneath the Mt . Fuji volcanic chain now belongs to the Kilaaks . Invaders will be driven back by force of arms . Understand ? What ? Damn it . Let 's go . Yeah . Meanwhile , at Monsterland on the Bonin Islands , the control center was running again . The staff was hard at work analyzing the monster-control devices that had been gathered from around the world . So it is the moon . That 's the true source of the signal ! We 'll send SY-3 to the moon . Don 't land ! And don 't take off those spacesuits till you deal with the Kilaaks . Proceed to the target . Understood . Take a look at your chart . Yes , sir . I 'll indicate your destination . 41 degrees north , 4 degrees west . The Cassini crater , south of the Vallis Alpes . Watch out for UFOs and approach from a low altitude . We 'll be on our way then . Our approach vector is 45 degrees to port . From the Sea of Tranquility to the Sea of Vapors . Down the western side of Montes Apenninus , then north from palus Putredinus . That 'll bring us to the Casaini crater . Roger . There 's a UFO 45 degrees to our starboard aft . We 've been detected ? It 'd be surprising if we weren 't . What do we do ? We either do this or turn around . Either way , circumstances won 't get any better than this . Okay , let 's do it . In an hour 's time we 'll either be successful or dead ! One minute to target ! Full stop . Full stop ! Prepare to descend . All right , here we go . Descend ! Descending ! Full stop ! Full stop ! Prepare the rover ! Preparing the rover ! Close the fuel valves ! Fuel valves closed ! Activate cooling system ! Activating cooling system ! Temperature still climbing ! Hurry ! Coolant pressure ? At max ! What ? Max ? Yes , sir ! What 's wrong ? It 's no use . At this rate , the fuel tank will explode ! Should we launch ? No time . We 'll attack from the rover ! Yes , sir ! Halt ! Halting ! Prepare to fire maser cannon ! Masercannon , ready to fire ! Fire ! Commander . SY-3 is in combat on the moon . We detected a flare at Cassini . All right , get in touch with the moon . I hope this works . We still don 't know if it worked or not ! I 'll report as soon as they come back alive . This is the moon base , over . Ignore it ! Yes , sir ... If they fail , we 'll be the next to die . We might get vaporized along with this base before long . Let 's just relax amd have some coffee . Yes , sir . Let 's get out . Yes , sir ! Okada , Yoshikawa , Arima , come with me . Fujita and Tani , stand by . Come on . Arima and Yoshikawa , inspect the equipment . Dismount and disable anything important . Understood , sir . I didn 't expect the maser to be this effective against them . Even the most advanced science will have some weak point . Hey . Over there too ! It 's the Kilaaks . They can nearly survive in high temperatures . When we destroyed the wall , the temperature dropped . Are they dead ? I 'm not sure . Captain ! Captain ! Gather them up . Yes , sir . This is the control device 's core . Damn thing 's still running . Let 's dismount it . We 'll take it back to Earth . Yes , sir . Moon base . Moon base ! No answer ? None at all . The base won 't answer , and the signal 's still there . Did they fail ? Do you think they failed ? . Damn . It 's not working . Time for the final option . Let 's detach the excavator ! Yes , sir . What 's going on ? Detach the maser . Right . Get a high-voltage cable ! Okay . Open it . Yes , sir . Screwdriver . Okay . Let 's go ! Hurry ! Given how long it 's been since that irregularity was observed on the moon , I think our only choice is to assume they failed . Okay , switch it on ! What 's wrong ? The circuit caught on fire ! I don 't care ! Turn it on and up ! We can 't go back if we do ! Don 't think about that ! Turn it on ! Yes , sir ! It worked ! The KiIaak signal vanished . Hurry ! It 's our turn to control the monsters . Yes , sir . Hurry ! You can bet the Kilaaks on Earth noticed this ! Is it still alive ? Yes , it is . But it needs a temperature in the thousands to become active again . Is it living metal ? Yes . Now we know why they were after the Mt . Fuji volcanic chain . Their scientific prowess far surpasses ours , but they 're very few in number . It probably takes thousands of years to grow to this state . Thousands of years ? Don 't they have a life span ? No . At constant high temperatures , they can probably live forever . Forever ? That 's right . But at low ones , they quickly become like this . Now we know how to attack them . Heavy use of freeze rays . Major Tada , draw up a plan . Yes , sir . Godzilla ! Again ? Doc ! You 're there ? Yes . Excellent . You 've done well . Doctor , this is no time for that ! Godzilla just showed up ! What ? Are you serious ? Godzilla has appeared in Tokyo ? Yes . You don 't say . Our control device is complete , so we thought we 'd test it on Godzilla . So he 's back in Japan . Then , Doctor ... The monsters are on our side . They 'll obey humam commamds . We 'll mobilize them all in the Mt . Fuji region ao they can trample the Kilaak base ! There isn 't a cloud today over Mt . Fuji . It and the primeval Aokigahara forest are silent , as if awaiting the impending full-scale giant-monster attack against the Kilaak base . The defense forces are already in position . There are still no monsters to be seen . Will the first to arrive be Godzilla ? Rodan ? Anguirus ? We still don 't see them . We still ... Oh , there 's one ! It 's GodziIIa , far off in the lower right , beyond the Yoshida Asama Shrine forest . No , it 's Minilla . Minilla is the first to appear . Following him , we have the king of monsters , Godzilla . Now Mothra has appeared . Mothra is approaching from the same direction as Godzilla . Next to appear is Anguirus . It 's Anguirus from the Asagiri Plateau on the left . Truly a sight to see . Following Anguirus are Manda , Baragon , and Gorosaurus . Kumonga 's here too . One after another , they 're bearing down on the Kilaak base here in Aokigahara . Rodan is too . Flying over Lake Motsu with the Southern Alps in the horizon . Rodan 's now over Lake Kawaguchi . He 's landing near Godzilla and Mothra . Will Godzilla lead the opening charge ? He seems to be deciding where to attack . The Kilaaks underground have still shown no reaction . This force of giant monsters with Godzilla at its head is truly a sight to behold . UFO approaching . What ? It 's King Ghidorah . He 's no Earth monster . The Kilaaks summoned him . We can 't control him . What do we do ? We 'll make Godzilla and the Earth monsters fight together . King Ghidorah is a monster from space . Earth 's monsters are mo match for him . Contact me whenever you 're ready to talk . Damn it . It 's King Ghidorah , the space monster . He 's taking aim at the Earth monsters from the air . The monsters are ready . King Ghidorah is swooping down savagely ! This is an amazing struggle ! Hear for yourselves the cries of these dreadful monsters ! A burning monster is flying south toward Izu . A burning monster ? I 've never heard of such a thing ! Space creature or not , it can live while on fire ? It 's heading straight for us ! Evacuate ! The Kilaaks are signaling us ! Fire Dragon destroyed Dr. Yoshida 's control system . Won 't further conflict simply result in more losses on your part ? What now ? Do we attack ? Fire Dragon can reduce Tokyo to ashes in two to three hours . Is that Godzilla ? It is . He 's found the Kilaaks ' underground stronghold . The monsters are on the offensive . They 're still fighting , even without the control system . They know by instinct who the true enemy is . The KiIaaks didn 't manage to see that coming ! Get away from here . G ! Thank goodness . It 's to soon to celebrate . Fire Dragon 's coming back from the Bonin Islands . We 'll ambush him with the SY-3 ! Katsuo ! Fire Dragon , 15 degrees ahead to port ! Prepare to fire freeze-ray missiles ! Fire ! We can 't ! The tracking system isn 't working ! It 's being jammed . All right , use manual aim . Yes , sir ! Let him fly past and stay on him ! Yes , sir ! Ready to fire ! Firing ! We 've got to shake him ! Look ! A Kilaak flying saucer ... I get it ! Fire Dragon was just a machine ! We aren 't being jammed amymore . Do we fire ? Yeah . Fire ! We 've done it ! Captain ! The End

 Cipher , coding , optics , computers - experts in every field , yet we ´ re still left with 36 badly-photographed colour shots . Yet I ´ m sure the clue ´ s there . You ´ ve tried superimposing ? Yes , but the permutations on 36 run into millions . Coming to them fresh , we may get a sudden flash . That ´ s Loch Ness ? Yes . We ´ ve pinpointed the position exactly . Not an inspired photographer , however brilliant a scientist . Extraordinary order of filming . Loch Ness , the Yorkshire Moors , Dartmouth , the Eiffel Tower , Beachy Head ... What ´ s number six ? Hopelessly overexposed . - Is there a reason ? - There are nine very overexposed . The rest are correctly exposed . I hate to say this , Sir Charles , but maybe there ´ s no clue here . - How do you work that out ? - Code-breaking ´ s a finite problem . We don ´ t know there is a problem here , or on what reasoning it ´ s set . We Just haven ´ t thought of it . And I don ´ t accept that we can ´ t . Do we know where Seltzman is ? ( Thunder ) ( Thunder continues ) ( Helicopter ) Relax . Relax , old boy . It won ´ t be long now . ( Horn sounds ) Ah , Colonel ! Had a good trip ? - Yes , thank you . - Would you care for breakfast ? No , thanks . I ´ d like to know my duties as soon as possible . You ´ ve no idea why you ´ re here ? I was sentby the highest authority . Indeed . You should feel proud . I ´ m gratified , certainly . Now , if you ´ d be kind enough to explain what I ´ m supposed to do ... What sort of opinion would you form ... of that fellow ? Anyone who spends his time doing that must be rather stupid . You couldn ´ t be more wrong . He ´ s our most interesting citizen . Particularly for you . Why ´ s that ? You ´ ll find out . Tell me , ... have you heard of Professor Seltzman ? Professor Jacob Seltzman ? I don ´ t recall the name . Should I ? No , in your line of business , I suppose not . Dr Seltzman is a great neurologist , fascinated by thought transference . I ´ ve seen it done - in India . Where Seltzman studied for many years . The advanced yogi can live in suspended animation for months , his mind and body dissociated . Seltzman took this discipline several stages further . With scientific aid , he was able to transmit the psyche of one person ... into another . The mind of one man into another ? ! Impossible . I don ´ t believe it . Where is this Seltzman ? Nobody knows . The only man who may , because he had the last contact with him , is , um ... our friend . You claim it ´ s possible for me to become you and you to become me ? - Not exactly , but near enough . - I don ´ t believe it . Ten years ago , would you have believed we could fly to the moon ? No , I suppose not . But why the interest in Seltzman ? Colonel , you must be aware that all major powers hold in prison one or two of each other ´ s spies . Yes . Sometimes diplomatic swaps occur . Imagine the power we ´ d have if the spy we returned had the mind of our choosing . We could break the security of any nation . Let me show you one or two other things that will interest you . We call this our " amnesia " room . We ´ re rather proud of it . With it , we can erase the memory back to any point in time . This man was very co-operative . He told us everything in three days . With hardly any persuasion . Now we wipe out all unhappy memories of the village and put him back into circulation to gather more information . And this ... is the Seltzman machine . ( Siren ) Let me give you a dummy run . ( Crackling and beeps ) ( Beeps increase in pitch ) The device with which Seltzman finally succeeded in switching the minds of two people . ( Steady beeps ) Sleep well , my friend , and forget us . Tomorrow you will wake up a new man . ( Groans ) Hmm ... ( Hums ) ( Number Six ´ s voice ) Hmm ... Yes , not a bad day . Let ´ s see , it ´ s ... Oh , yes , Janet ´ s birthday present . Hope she likes it . Can always change it if she doesn ´ t . What ´ s on for today ? Let ´ s see ... Er , car service , dentist ... No , we ´ ll have to cancel that , because Sir Charles ´ lunches , they go on for ever . But who can blame him ? He ´ s the boss . ( Hums ) ( Number Two ) ´ Seltzman machine ... ´ .. finally succeeded in switching the minds ... ´ .. switching the minds of two people . ´ Relax . I am not a number . I am a person . ( Thunder ) ´ You ´ re very aggressive . ´ ( Siren ) ´ You mustn ´ t resist . ´ Take it easy . Take it easy . ´ It will all be one in the end . ´ Unlike me , many of you have accepted your imprisonment ´ and will die here like rotten cabbages . ´ I intend to discover who are the prisoners , and who are the warders . ´ The thing to do now is keep calm . ´ Keep your head . ´ I won ´ t be pushed , filed , stamped , briefed , debriefed , or numbered ! ´ Just bear in mind your ultimate objective . ´ We want information . Information ! ´ Seltzman ... Seltzman ... ´ Proceed as our friend would have done . ´ Relax . Good . ´ Now , go , boy , go ! ´ This is the time . Now . Move , or leave it . ´ Move , move , MOVE ! ´ Seltzman ! ´ ( Doorbell ) His car ... Is he back ? Is he with you ? Yes . Darling ? Darling ? ( Doors open upstairs ) - Where is he ? - Janet ... however fantastic what I say may sound , you must believe me . Who are you ? How do you know my name ? What are you doing here ? How did you get hold of his car ? Why ... Why did you tell me he was here ? Who are you ? A friend . Then where is he ? Why did he leave without a word ? Leave ? But he saw you - he told me he saw you . - Last night . - I didn ´ t see him last night . - You dined after your fitting . - What fitting ? Your dress for your birthday party . He told me the colour - yellow silk . Yellow silk ? The only ye ... That was a year ago . Yes , I ... I took him to the final fitting . I haven ´ t seen him since . A year ? ! A year ! What ´ s happened ? You couldn ´ t have seen him . He couldn ´ t have made that mistake . No , but I could have . - I must have got it wrong . - Yes , you must have . What are you doing here ? How did you get in , anyway ? Miss Portland , ... you must be aware of the sort of work he did . Obviously , working for my father . So it won ´ t surprise you to learn that ... it may not be possible for him to contact you for a year . Or even longer . Thanks . That ´ s a big help . Miss Portland ? I may have a message for you soon . When ? I ´ ll bring it to your birthday party . Father , I must speak with you . It ´ s not a very convenient time . I hope this won ´ t become a habit . I ´ m sorry , but it is important . And personal - do you mind ? Perhaps you ´ d be good enough to give us a few minutes ? - Certainly , sir . - Thank you . Thank you . Now , my dear . You know where he is . All along you ´ ve known , and you let me go through hell ! He ´ s on a mission . He can ´ t contact me . I presume you mean your fiancee . His house , his car - he ´ s lent them to a friend ! This friend , what sort of man is he ? Quite ordinary . Is he unable to contact me ? I honestly don ´ t know . You didn ´ t send him on a mission ? No . And I shouldn ´ t even tell you that . Even you don ´ t know where he is ? ! I have no idea . But you must know someone who does . Again , I can ´ t help you . It ´ s awful ! I don ´ t know if you ´ re telling the truth or not ! - Get me Sir Charles ! - Who are you ? ! What are you doing here ? ! I said get me Sir Charles Portland at once ! You ´ re still as pompous as ever ... Danvers . Where did you get my name ? Jonathan Peregrine Danvers . Born in Bootle . Took elocution lessons . Came to London , Joined the civil service in 1948 as a Junior clerk . Was moved to this department three years later - mainly at the request of the typing pool . Am I going to see Sir Charles ? Well ? . Or shall I go on ? I ´ m sure these gentlemen would be intrigued to hear of your little Jaunt to Paris in March , 1958 . Let me see , what was her name ... ? What is your name ? - Code or real ? . - Code . In France , Duval . In Germany , Schmidt . You would know me best as ZM73 . And your code number is PR12 . Do you want more ? Seltzman . All right , thank you . - Danvers , I must ask you to leave . - Yes , sir . What do you know about Seltzman ? He invented a device to put one man ´ s mind into another man ´ s head . Sir Charles ... At last ! I am ZM73 . You claim to be ZM73 . - I can prove it . - Do so . I could pitch this on a very personal level . Don ´ t spare my feelings . Speak freely . Very well . I ´ ll confine myself to simple domestic details , of no interest to anyone except the family . Details that could only be known by us - would you accept that ? Yes , I suppose . You are a keen rosarian . And you were pruning your bacaras by the goldfish pool when I asked permission to marry your daughter . You dropped your secateurs - I never understood why . It couldn ´ t have been that much of a surprise . Next day you took me to lunch at your club . We ate Jugged hare - I don ´ t dispute your accuracy . You ´ re correct in every detail . But all this could have been told to you by the man you claim to be . We ´ re all aware of truth drugs and other ways to extract information . You could ´ ve learnt it parrot-fashion . Ask me details of anything we did together . The same problem applies . I could never convince you , then ! Only enough to intrigue me , to make sure you ´ re watched and followed wherever you go . It ´ s a waste of somebody ´ s time . - He ´ ll be paid for it . - Thank you . Thank you very much ! ( Number Six ´ s voice ) ´ Where is he ? ´ ´ Where is he ? ´ Where is he ? ´ Did he perfect the reversion process ? ´ If he didn ´ t , it ´ s a pity . ´ Before I know it , I ´ ll be inside for forgery . ´ Talking of forgery , is my handwriting still the same ? ´ Let ´ s see . Let ´ s try it . ´ ( CHUCKLES ) Rather interesting , isn ´ t it ? That ´ s something . ´ Well , let ´ s be grateful for small mercies . ´ Now ... Money . ´ Unless the rats have been at it . ´ Good . ´ Still intact . Fresh as ever . ´ Splendid . ´ That should be ... adequate . ´ ( Jazz music ) Sure he ´ s being followed ? A homing device is on his car . Our man will be there by now . ( Pop music ) I didn ´ t invite you . I haven ´ t taken it to heart . Our friend lent me his card - a year out of date . - You ´ ve seen him ? - Not exactly . Look , do you work for my father ? Did he send you here ? No , but I have no doubt that he knows I ´ m here . When I arrived , they were playing a waltz - the first I danced with my dear love , in Kitzbuhel . How do you know all this ? Where is he ? Please . I have a message from him . He left something with you for safekeeping , in case of trouble . A slip of paper . Yes . Yes , I have it . If you want to see him again , will you get it ? I ´ ll be in the arbour . May I ? Excuse me . ´ Was she Just trying to get rid of me ? ´ Will she come ? ´ Will she have the receipt ? ´ ( Footsteps ) I ´ m sorry I was so long . Here it is . Thank you . Now what was the message ? Simply this . Who else could have given you that message ? Nobody but ... Couldn ´ t you say ... " Nobody but you " ? I need your faith . Nobody but ... you . I ´ m sorry , sir . Am I late or are you possibly Just a little early ? In a hurry , put it that way . What can I do for you , sir ? I left some film - a roll of colour you dispatched for me . Er ... Here ´ s the receipt . Thank you , sir ... Just over a year ago . Yes . But you still have it , presumably ? Certainly , sir . It Just takes that second or two longer . Always the way when we ´ re in a hurry . I ´ ll be as quick as I can . Here we are , sir . If you ´ ll be kind enough to sign . - That was quick . - Well , there ´ s only one , sir . It ´ s been signed for already . Er , yes . A stupid clerical error . A Junior handed over your film in mistake for this number . Pure carelessness , confusing the last figures 0-1 and 1-0 . Needless to say , he wasn ´ t with us for long . However , Mr Carmichael returned your transparencies the moment he discovered our mistake . - How good of Mr Carmichael . - Kind of you to take it that way . Alas , no business is free from the occasional clerical error . Is there anything else , sir ? - Yes . - What is that , sir ? - Can I get a photograph taken ? - A photograph ? A passport photograph . I ´ m afraid our photographer is on holiday . He would be . As you say , sir . I won ´ t promise a flattering study of you , sir , but I think it ´ ll be satisfactory to the passport authorities . - Thank you . - Pleasure , sir . This way . He has collected the transparencies , sir . That confirms my conviction . They contain a clue , and our bright boys missed it . XB4 . He ´ s gone inside . Now the curtains are being drawn . ´ Stay put until he leaves . ´ Miss out one , M. ( Recites alphabet ) M - Thirteen . And N must be fourteen . Sir , the curtains are being opened . He ´ s coming out and getting into his Lotus . Follow him . Our route ´ s definitely Dover . Welcome to the village , sir . Would you like to order ? ( Homing device beeps ) I took some photographs . Look ... There ´ s one . - Is he still here ? - Yes . Herr Hellen , sir . - Where is he now ? - In the barber ´ s shop , I suppose . ( Homing device beeps ) ( Speaks German ) The waiter at the cafe said I could get a shave here . Yes . That is correct . Please , sit down . Your English is very good . We barbers get around - in several big London stores . Very bad air , usually downstairs , so I come back to where I am born . Herr Hellen , I ´ ll come to the point . I don ´ t want a shave . I want your help - desperately . How , sir ? We have met before . But you couldn ´ t remember me , because the first time we met ... I looked like this . It is not possible . You see , Professor Seltzman ... your invention works - only too well . I am a simple village barber . Don ´ t play tricks on an old man . Believe me , you ´ re the last person I ´ d choose , but somebody ´ s played a trick on me ! - Do you know that face ? - Of course . He was a friend . But anyone with that photograph could claim to be him . - For what reason ? - Perhaps you will tell me . I understand . Incognito until I can prove that I am that man . But anything I say can be countered by you by saying I ´ ve extracted the information . Yes , that is so . Herr Professor , would you admit that , as with fingerprints , no two handwritings could be the same ? I would . Then the only way I can prove I am that man depends on whether you kept that letter I sent you from London when you were staying in Scotland . If you really are who you say you are , you would not have expected me to keep it , would you ? No . It ´ s a hopeless situation . If I had kept it , I would have been very stupid . Silly . You ´ ve made your point . But you overlook one thing . Sentimental people are sometimes stupid . Very stupid . Wait , please . ( Homing device beeps faster ) My poor , young friend . But who ... ? - I don ´ t know . - The motive is clear . You will lead them to me , that is what they hope . Do you think your people have done this to you ? - No . I ´ m sure . - Then it must be your enemies . My enemies , presumably , having my other half ? Precisely . If you are taken by the side that hasn ´ t , you must learn to accept yourself ... as you are . ( Fast beeps ) As both sides want my reversal process , it will be a close race . The reversal process exists ? In theory . But , put into practice , it could be dangerous . Very . Here comes the first of our visitors . Is his face familiar ? Potter ! He mustn ´ t take us . Then hide behind this door . - ( Shop bell rings ) - Come in , come in . Don ´ t move , please , Professor . ( Gas hisses ) ( Helicopter ) Ah , Herr Professor ! Welcome to our humble village . Had a good trip ? Let me offer you some breakfast . You have kidnapped me for one reason . My answer is no ! ( Chuckles ) You ´ re livery this morning . Surely we need not prolong this interview . Life hasn ´ t taught you resignation . Nor has it for many other scientists . Rutherford , for example . How he must regret having split the atom . Yes . Almost as bad as splitting the identity of two human beings . Unlike all the King ´ s men , you can put them together again . - Don ´ t rely on it . - Why make this stand now ? After all , you invented the wretched process . Only people like you have made it wretched . Can you leave this poor young man with his mind wrongly housed ? Surely you owe him some responsibility ? I will do it - on certain conditions . I ´ m sure they ´ ll be reasonable . For once , I am dictating . Heil . I will do it . But alone . Under this condition only . I accept . Very well . I shall need time to prepare myself . In twelve hours . All cameras turn . Make a note of everything he does . ( Beeps ) ( Whirring ) ( Crackles and beeps ) ( Beeps get faster ) Emergency . Examination room . Immediate treatment . ´ Emergency . Emergency . ( Sirens ) He must not die . I need him . Colonel , your help has been invaluable . - I trust I ´ ve been of service . - Yes . You ´ ll be suitably rewarded . Your helicopter is waiting for you . You assured me that he was in good health . You must contact Number One and tell him ... I did my duty . The Colonel ! The man who ´ s flying out of here ... Is not who you thought . I don ´ t believe it . I watched . I saw everything . The good doctor ´ s mind now inhabits a body perhaps not to his liking - the Colonel ´ s . Dr Seltzman had progressed more than anticipated . He can , and did , change three minds at the same time . And he ´ s now free to continue his experiments in peace .

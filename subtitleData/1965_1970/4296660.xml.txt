 [ Frequency Oscillating ] That 's strange . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . Ray , what do you make of that ? Well , they look like interference waves . That 's what I thought , but we never use those frequencies . I 'll have it checked out . This interference , is there any way it could affect Tony and Doug ? - No , I don 't believe so . - Hello , this is Dr. Swain . Will you run an immediate check on channels 1 00 to infinity ? Yes , it 's interference . And make it quick . [ Explosions ] - Look ! - How did he get here ? Dr. Ann MacGregor ... I 'm here to take you with me . Who are you ? Now , wait a minute . You can 't - General ! Hold your fire ! [ Screaming ] Take him to the infirmary . Ann - Ann is gone . But where ? General , we 've got to do something . We 've got to find her . Yes , but how ? I wish I knew . I wish I knew where he came from . You know , he looked as though he might 've been a time traveler from the future . - Look . - What ? Looks like one of our data cards . Only it 's made of metal - a metal I 've never seen before . Ray , do you think our computer can handle this ? Let 's try it . I hope this doesn 't jam the machine . - Anything ? - These seem to be coordinates of some kind . - It could be where he 's taken Ann . - I don 't know . There 's something odd about these figures . Ray , suppose we try switching Tony and Doug to these coordinates ? - That would be too risky . - Are you suggesting we do nothing ? No , no . But suppose he meant us to find these coordinates ? We 'll make the switch , now . If we do this , you realize we may never regain contact with any of them again ? Switch them . [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . It 's like nothing I 've ever seen . Well , it 's got to be the distant future . Tony . Look . An ancient Roman . Pardon me , sir ? What century are we in ? You were transferred out of your time too . You are Roman , aren 't you ? Can you hear me ? Doug , he can 't . He can 't see or hear . He doesn 't seem to have any sensation at all . I know . This whole place has a feeling about it that makes it seem unreal . Obviously , he 's from the third or fourth century ... and he 's a citizen of ancient Rome . All we know is what we see . - He is Roman . - [ Man ] Notjust any Roman . He is Marcus Tullius Cicero - Roman statesman , lawyer , scholar , writer . It was he who upheld the principles of the ancient republic ... during the civil wars which were destroying Rome . Who are you ? Where are you ? I don 't get it . We 're from the 20th century . Here we are somewhere in the future . Now , Cicero 's from either the first or second century B.C. What are we doing in the same time and place ? Doug . He looks medieval . [ Man ] He is Erasmus , who lived from 1 469 A.D. to 1 536 . He studied and lectured at the University of Paris . His wide circle of friends included Sir Thomas More of England . He corresponded with all the most learned men ofhis day . Erasmus . The Renaissance scholar . That is right . Erasmus , the humanist theologian . He 's dead , and yet he 's not dead . [ Man ] Very good . Both of them ... like vegetables . I wonder where that voice is coming from ? Where on earth are they ? They 're not on Earth at all , I 'm afraid . Take another look at the spatial coordinates . - Another planet ? - Clear out of our solar system . - But you 've got a fix . - And a fairly good one . - What about Ann ? - No sign of her yet . Ray , have I made a blunder ... sending them blindly to those coordinates ? Honestly , I don 't know , General . If she 's there , there 's a chance they 'll find her . Even so , can we retrieve them ? If this fix remains stable , yes . But first , they 've got to find her . What are these things ? What are their functions ? Nothing makes sense . [ Man ] Dr. Anthony Newman . - Dr. Douglas Phillips . - What 's that ? I could swear that voice came from in here . You will follow the light . Follow the light at once . ! Well , I guess we might as well see what it 's all about . - I don 't get this . - I don 't either . But I doubt if we 're supposed to . Come on . You know our names . How ? I know much more than you realize . Where are we ? We need no roofs here . We have achieved perfect climate control . What year are we in ? And where is " " here " ? A place from which you will never return . The year is 1 91 0 . [ Chuckles ] Why , that 's impossible . I will have it stated in terms of Earth years . [ Electronic Voice ] 8433 anno Domini . There 's your answer . It is 8433 A.D. The year 8433 . I had the computer translate the coordinates . - And the location ? - You were right about another planet . They 're in the planetary system of the star Canopus . Canopus . That 's approximately a hundred light years away . It 's actually 98 . Tony and Doug are on a planet moving around that star ... more than 6,000 years from now . But look at our fix . It 's strong . Strong enough to bring them back when they find Ann ? Easily . If they find her . [ Electronic Voice ] Upon his graduation from high school in 1 954 anno Domini ... Newman left Philadelphia for Boston ... to matriculate to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on scholarship . While at this institution , he - [ Beeping ] - Yes ? - Your presence is required in the dispatching chamber . Very well . It 's incredible . - They know absolutely everything . - I know . I don 't know where we are or how we 're gonna get out of here , but we 've got to try . Come on . - [ Alarm Blaring ] - That way ! [ Punches Landing ] [ Laser Firing ] - Look out ! - [ Laser Firing ] It can 't be that easy . They won 't give up . Oh , what difference does it make ? Well , where do we go next ? Maybe they have a fix on us back at the Tunnel . They could move us . Yeah , they could , but I doubt it . Watch it . [ Laser Firing ] [ Man ] Throw down your weapons and surrender . This is absurd . Surrender now . Of course , if you want harm to come to her - Look , and you 'll understand . Throw down your weapons . [ Weapons Dropping ] Ann . It really is you . How did you get here ? Doug ? Tony ? I - I was taken by force . Kidnapped . Well , how long have you been here ? I don 't know . I - I don 't - Hours , days . They did something to me . Drugged me . Oh , let me go . - Let her go ! - Look , she can 't harm you . Please , let me go ! [ Man ] Guards , release her . [ Sobbing ] Oh , Doug ! I don 't know what I would 've done without you . It 's all right . General ! Quick ! They found her . - Can we transfer them all back ? - Yes . We 'll be ready to start the countdown in 20 seconds . Let me have the microphone , please . - Ready . - Ann ? Doug ? Tony ? General ? Have you got us located ? Yes . Stand by . We 'll have you out of there in 30 seconds . Maintain your present position . Don 't move . - Let her go ! - General , now ! Now ! - Hold your position ! Hurry it up ! - We 've started the countdown . - Just don 't lose that fix . - We 've got them this time , General . Fifteen seconds and counting . Ten , nine ... eight , seven ... six , five , four ... three , two - One step toward any person in this complex , and you 'll be shot . Stop , or they 'll shoot ! All right , fire ! [ Gunshots Continue ] - The time-space converter ! - Wait ! What have you done with her ? I promised you no harm will come to her . - Then where is she ? Why can 't we see her ? - You will . You will . We wanna see her now . All right , have it your way . You said she was all right . I just said she was not ready to see you . You 've done the same thing to her that you did to the others . Nonsense . The others are in what we call " " suspension . " There is nothing changed about her . Look . I 've just put her through a preliminary interrogation . Oh , Doug ! Oh , Doug ! What has happened ? Where are we ? You 're all right . Yeah , for the time being . Oh , Tony . Why are you all so apprehensive ? I plan nothing shocking or horrible for you . Suspension is nothing to be afraid of . - [ Bell Chimes ] - Ah , good . Right on schedule . Ann , did the Time Tunnel have a fix on us when you were captured ? - Yes . - Don 't worry . They 'll probably switch us . Follow me , please . This should be interesting for you . This place has several functions . We call it our teleport chamber . What 's that there ? It is our own time machine . Simple , isn 't it ? But all truly great things are simple . - How is it controlled ? - That information is classified . But you 're about to witnesses a demonstration . Step back , please , and watch . This is the official time traveler attached to my project . We call him " " Ott " because of the initials of his title - O-T-T . We no longer use surnames , of course . Mission completed . - Where did you get that ? - This is the correct part . That 's all . Thank you . That 's a space-time converter . From our complex . The Tunnel is useless without it . Which is precisely why I sent for it . Now that you 're here , I don 't want your Tunnel taking you back ... - before I 'm through with you . - What are you going to do now ? - Probably kill us . - By no means . I must have you alive . I need you for my project . - And just what is this project of yours ? - Later . Take them to their quarters . All right . As fast as possible then . - Right . - Well ? We have the replacements in stock , General , but - - But what ? - Well , with a full crash program ... the testing , the adjusting , the tuning will take at least 1 0 days . - Ten days ? For one part ? - Well , it 's hardly an ordinary part . The time-spatial conversion unit ... is the most important single component in the entire operation . - You 'll have to do it faster than that . - But I doubt if we can . But in 1 0 days , Ann , Tony and Doug will be - be beyond reach . We 'll never recover them then . Never ! [ Sighs ] We 've got to do something . There must be some way to escape . What about their time machine ? - Do you have any idea how to operate it ? - No . I doubt that we could even get to it . What 's this project of his ? What did he call it ? Suspension ? What could that be ? I don 't know , but I have an idea ... we 're going to find out , and soon . Now what ? Now , what in the world do you suppose they are ? I don 't know . [ Man ] By now , you have received your dinner . I hope you enjoy it . - Dinner ? - Where did that come from ? - He talks through walls . - Not through the walls , Dr. Newman . Through space . I can receive your voice communication . over any distance . - I find it most convenient . Don 't you ? - Very . About the dinner - I want you to consume it for your own good . - Those cubes ? - I apologize for the form . On this planet , we have no organic food . These nutrient cubes are made expressly for our guests . He 's lying . It 's impossible for any animal form to exist without food of some sort . Not at all . We do . We 've had to make a biological adaptation . Theoretically , it 's possible . Plants get their nourishment from the sun . Maybe they do too . Exactly . Not from the sunlight , of course . Our star 's Canopus , not Sol . Instead of sunlight , it is Canopian light . But the principle is the same . Now , eat your dinner and come to my office . What do you think ? - We 'll take them . - Tony , how do we know what 's in them ? We don 't . But we do know he can hear us . And if we don 't take them willingly ... he 'll find another way to get them down us , won 't he ? Tony , you 're right . And besides , we could use the nourishment . Are you two - For all we know , they could be poison . Well , we 'll just have to take that chance . Oh , Tony , please ! Ann , trust me . They don 't taste too bad . All right , I 'll take mine then . There now . That wasn 't so bad , was it ? A very wise decision . Now , please come to my office at once . [ No Audible Dialogue ] There 's a guard stationed at both ends . You take this one . I 'll take that one . He 's gone . [ Cube Clatters ] - All right , let 's go , Ann . - Drop them . Drop them ! [ Weapons Drop ] Move ! I 've been waiting for you . Why the weapon ? They did not obey your order . I 'm sorry you make us use force on you . It 'd be so much simpler if you submitted to our will . You don 't give us much choice . That 's true , isn 't it ? All right , that 's all . I 'm going to answer your question about our project . You 'll find the concept fascinating . One of our subjects . We 've just extracted from him the sum total of his personality . His memory , his knowledge , his motivation - everything . And that 's your project ? We are gathering for the first time ... the full and complete data on every phase of the history of the planet Earth . We 'vejust completed our work on the subject . We now have comprehensive information ... on the psychology of tyrants . Fascinating . You might even recognize the subject . He was retrieved from a bunker in Berlin ... an instant before he attempted suicide . Why are you doing this to us ? Everything you know and sense and feel ... will also remain forever in our data files . You should be pleased . Actually , it 's a practical form of immortality . He 's a madman . There 's a very thin hairline between madness and genius . Make everything ready for the next subject . Why us ? We 're not geniuses . No , and we 're not historical figures . This project of yours , it doesn 't need us . You underestimate yourselves . The first men in history to travel through time . Your information can be invaluable . What about her ? She 's only a technician . - Why did you kidnap her ? - She was bait to bring you here . All right . Then she 's done her job . Let her go . Yes . She 's useless to you . I think not . She could also prove to be an interesting subject . No , we shall continue according to plan . I 'm afraid , right now , we 've run out of time . Nothing more can be done till morning . You should be feeling quite drowsy at this time . - Why ? - The cubes . They 're drugs . Exactly . Nothing to harm you , of course . - Just something to make you sleep quite peacefully . - And then ? In the morning , you will still be sleeping quietly ... at which time ... you will be immortalized . My congratulations . What happens to you ... at nightfall ? Why , we rest , naturally . You told us that you get your nourishment and energy from the sun . No , not the sun . Canopus . But come to the point . Time is short . Well , then you 're like plants . When it gets dark , you go dormant . It shouldn 't matter to you . By that time , you 'll all be asleep . - You were dishonest with me . - Yes . And you were dishonest with us . You told us that that was nourishment . Now when it gets dark , you 'll be helpless . You do as we say , or we 'll destroy your whole project . - Quick . What do you want ? - First , the space-time conversion unit . Second , the instructions to your time machine so that we can get out of here . No , never ! Tony ! - Do you think he reached the alarm ? - I don 't know . If it hadn 't been for the force field , I 'd have stopped him . [ Door Opens ] It 's all right . They can 't hurt us now . The converter-we 've got to find it . They could 've put it somewhere in this room , but where ? I know . Now , this desk seems to control everything in this room . Maybe we could figure it out . It 's all right , Ann . He can 't hurt you now . [ Sighs ] I 've never seen controls like this . - Try some of these buttons . - No . ! Tony , don 't . You don 't know what they 'll activate . - Hey . - What is it ? Did you find something ? I don 't know . Maybe . It looks like a form of heat-sensor cell . - [ Whirring ] - Look out ! Anything ? - Nothing . - It 's empty . We 've got to find that part ! How much time do we have left ? That 's the big question . It all depends on the rotating speed of this planet . Well , at least we won 't be interrupted until it gets light again . Let 's get to work . The minute it gets light again , we won 't have a chance . Well , look , the intervals between light and dark ... should be relatively equivalent , right ? No , not necessarily . For all we know ... this place might be located near one of the poles of this planet . Then night could last a matter of minutes . All right , listen . Tony , you and I 'll split up and look for the missing part . Ann , will you go in there and see if you can make ... any kind of sense out of that system of theirs ? Don 't worry . You 'll be safe enough until the light comes back . All right . I 'll try . If I could just get it open . He waved his hand ... obviously interrupting a beam somewhere . All right , Ann , go to work on that machine . - I 'll search in there . You cover this room . - Okay . [ Gasps ] [ Whirring ] No , no . Retest . Computer banks . Microsecond . Nanosecond . Tunnel , you 're off by a billionth . Over again . Testing . One second . Millisecond . Microsecond . Nanosecond . No , you 're off again . [ Sighs ] I 've never felt so utterly helpless in my life . We 're doing everything we can , General . It just takes time to tune the replacement unit . All right , once more . Towers . Testing for time scale . In seconds . [ Gasps ] Oh . You have no idea what you just did to me . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to interrupt your concentration . - Did you have any luck ? - Not much , I 'm afraid . You ? Nothing . No sign of that missing part yet . What 's that ? Well , I 'm not sure . You know , there are no labels ... no power levels , nothing at all ... to designate any control functions . - Except maybe plates like this . - Let me see that . They 're attached to the machine by some sort of magnetic force . They 're easy enough to remove . You know , these punch holes ... reminds me of a ... data processing card . Of course , Doug . Only metal . Indestructible . - Let 's show that to Tony . - Right . Tony . Stop and think . All the time we 've been here , do you remember seeing any writing ? Anything printed ? Signs , whatever . Now that you mention it , no . Maybe they don 't use writing anymore . Just maybe these have replaced it . Of course , Doug . That 's gotta be it . Do you remember when he was calculating the date ? He put something like this into the side of his desk , and a voice gave him an answer . Where ? Yeah . Here 's a slot . Try it . [ Electronic Voice ] Warning . Only one person may be dispatched at a time . Any number may return . You were right . Instructions . And the rest are in there . I 'll be able to figure out the transmission process now . We 'd better hurry . We don 't know how much time we have left . All right . - [ Door Opens ] - Doug ! Shh ! [ Exhales ] Oh ! How long will it take to get that machine in operation ? - I don 't know . I need those instructions in there . - Come on . I thought they were all asleep . Ott 's an exception . He was carrying something on his hip . It must be his power source . Maybe because of his time travel work . But he 's gotta have a dormant period . No human organism can stay active indefinitely . Well , he 's active now , and that 's all that matters . - He could come busting in here at any second . - Come on . You got it ? - I think so . - [ Door Opens ] Get back . - He 's gone . - Yes , but where ? That 's the question . Come on . Let 's see if you have the right instructions . Tony , when we play them back , he 'll hear it . We 're gonna have to take that chance . Come on . [ Electronic Voice ] Spatial coordinates , planetary system Sol . Planet : Earth . Continent : North America . Target : Time Tunnel Complex . It 's still set for our Time Tunnel . To activate , stand on dais . Depress red transmittal button . - That 's all I have to know . - All right , Ann . Now , you go in there and send yourself back to the Time Tunnel . - Well , what about you two ? - Listen , only one at a time can go . You 're first . Suppose something happens . Suppose you can 't follow me . Doug - Now , listen , Ott 's due back in here at any second . - Now , come on . Let 's get going . - Oh . No , wait , wait ! The medallion . Get the medallion he 's wearing . - What for ? - It 's a weapon . - A weapon ? How do you know ? - Ott used it when he kidnapped me . Killed one of our guards . You think he 's still protected by that force field ? I doubt it . I think it 's some kind of emanation . As long as he 's dormant , it must be too . It 's all right . He aimed it and twisted it someway . - I 'm sure I can work it . - All right . Let 's get going . No ! Wait , please . The converter . We 've got to find it . If something goes wrong in there and you can 't follow me - The Tunnel can bring you back if we have the converter . We must find it . Are you searching for this ? I could 've killed you then . Don 't any of you try to approach me ! - What are you gonna do ? - My instructions are to keep you alive if possible . It is your choice whether or not I kill you here and now . And if you do keep us alive , we become permanent guinea pigs . - Is that right ? - That is correct . How long do you plan to keep us standing here ? Only until it becomes light again . I am told you are potentially useful to us . If it were left to me , I would rather kill all of you right now and be done with it . Is it getting light , or is it my imagination ? Ann , take this and send yourself back . Hurry . Oh , Tony . They 'll be waking up soon . We 've got to try to hold them off until she gets safely away . Tony , look out . You make one move , and you 're a dead man . Freeze ! Put your weapons on the table . All right . Now back away . Come on ! All right , Tony . Let 's get out of here . Hurry , Ann ! Press it ! Ann ! - Ann ! - Oh , General . I 've got it . I 've got the converter . Make ready for an immediate switch . We 've got to get them out of there now ! Right . Disconnect test equipment . Disconnect power . Tunnel power units ! Computers ! Go ahead . Activate all units . Ray , activate controls . We 've got it . We 've got it ! Make the switch . Immobilizer , quickly . That one first . Don 't let him use the weapon ! - [ Gunfire ] - [ Shouting ] - British and Arabs fighting . - Middle East or North Africa . Judging from their clothing and weapons ... I 'd say it was late 1 9th or early 20th century . Well , whatever the time or place , it 's desert . We 'd better help ourself to some water and weapons . Come on . What is that ? Whoever he is , he 's got company . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? What we are does not matter . We are here to destroy you .

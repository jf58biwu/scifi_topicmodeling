 What do you want up here ? I 'm here to find John Maxwell Avery . I said I 'm here to find John Maxwell Avery . And now you 've found him . I 'm John Avery . Tom Hendrix , Attorney General 's office . Pleasure to meet you , Mr. Hendrix . I 'm here to take you back . Back where , sir ? Washington . Under direct orders of the President of the United States . Really ? And who are the gentlemen with you ? Marshal Kirby of Pima County , and a deputy . You 'll be granted the protection of presidential custody . Well , now , that sounds impressive . I have my orders , Mr. Avery . So you do , and from Washington . I would advise you not to try anything foolish , Marshal . You can take the body back with you , and you can tell Washington ... there 's my answer . Are you Mr. West ? No , sir . If you will follow me ? Chopin 's " Nocturne in E Flat , " gentlemen , and beautifully executed , wouldn 't you say ? Artemus Gordon , gentlemen , at your service . Tennyson , where 's my coffee ? And that , gentlemen , is Mr. West . Your coffee is almost ready , sir , and your guests have arrived . Gentlemen . Captain Davis . Marshal Kirby . Won 't you gentlemen please sit down ? Appreciate your hospitality , Mr. West , but I 'd much rather learn what this is all about . Just as you say , Captain . There was some mention of help . What kind of help , Mr. West ? The army 's spread thin out here . No time to play guide to visiting tourists . The Secret Service takes a dim view of pleasure trips , Captain . We 're here to find John Avery . Look , John Avery is a stinking butcher . Him and his thieving gang have turned this area into a slaughterhouse , leaving nothing but a trail of blood . That trail still must lead somewhere . It does . Up there among those devil-cursed rocks . A deserted , worked - out mining camp - that 's where you 'll find John Avery . Can 't the army flush him out , Captain ? Mr. West , we 've been up there . A full troop , all the men we could spare . There are 22 new military graves to prove our attempt . Would you like to see those graves ? Thank you , Captain . We have our assignment . Still , I think a man could work his way up there alone . If a man was foolish enough to try , and if a man was lucky enough to reach John Avery , even get close enough to kill him , that man wouldn 't stand a chance of getting out of there alive . Our assignment 's not to kill him . It 's to find him and bring him back alive . I 'm sorry , gentlemen . I wish we could help you , but if you still intend to find John Avery , there are two things we can offer . What 's that ? Our condolences , and a decent burial . Good day , gentlemen . Mr. West . Well ... I say let 's wire Washington and ask for another assignment . Something simple , like , uh , cutting our throats . Oh , we don 't bring Avery back , and they probably will . Mmm . Why is the president so anxious to bring him back alive ? Avery was a big man in Washington , you know that . A close confidant to the president . Sure , till they found out that he was a corrupt , vicious political manipulator . Too many people think the president fixed it so Avery could get away , and now the president has to personally produce Avery at a Senate hearing . Bringing Avery back alive could stop a scandal that would rock the nation . Ah , now it 's clear . James , my boy , you 're grinning like an undertaker ready to dress a corpse . Mine . Artemus , have you ever considered returning to the stage ? Yes , many times , and never more seriously than right now . What are you looking at my violin like that for ? Um , a Trojan horse . An innocent show wagon , traveling in the west and innocently getting lost . Oh , no , oh , no . That gambit is not going to work with me . If you think I 'm going to step into a coffin just because you hold out an offer for me to get back on a stage , not on your life . Ah , trodding the boards again . Performing before an audience . The sound of applause . A standing ovation . And no song and dance , now , Jim . Readings from the Bard . From Hamlet to King Lear . Hamlet . Looks like the game 's started . Only one man ? Avery can 't be that short-handed . What are you doing out here ? We 're on our way to Pima . Uh , yes , my good man . An engagement there . Pima 's 20 miles the other way . No ! Another wrong turn , Mr. Whitney . When will you learn ? Thank you very much , my good sir . Now we 'll just turn this thing about . Mister , we don 't take to strangers coming this close , best you keep right on coming . Sam ! Ride back and tell Mr. Avery we 're bringing in some visitors . What about our engagement in Pima ? Let 's go . Uh , do as the man says , Mr. Whitney . Found them headed this way , Mr. Avery . They claim they 're lost , but I figured you 'd want to look them over . Which one of you is in charge ? Here , sir - Conroy Whitney . My partner , Mr. Artemus Gordon . Mason , search them . Check the wagon from top to bottom . Perhaps you 'll perform for us , Mr. Whitney . My men could use a little diversion . Well , at least Avery was kind enough not to put a guard on us . Why bother ? He 's got the place surrounded like a fortress . We 'd never get out the way we came in . My guess is there 's another way out - an escape route set up by Avery just in case . All right , James , let 's assume you 're right , and that we even find it . Now , how do you propose to invite Avery to join us ? I 'll try to endear myself to him . Uh-huh . James , my boy , start endearing . Mr. Avery , I 've been hoping to see you . Were you , Mr. Whitney ? The way we were brought here , almost like prisoners . Are we your prisoners , Mr. Avery ? " Prisoners " sounds so melodramatic . Let 's just say that you 're my guests . Oh ... Artemus , I told you he was a gentleman . A man of his character doesn 't change . Then we 've met before , Mr. Whitney ? Well , never socially , but , uh , when I played Washington , the name John Avery was very important in politics and in society . Box " A " at the theater ? And now you find me out here , in a place like this . Oh , as I find myself , sir . A turn of the cards . That 's right , Mr. Whitney . A turn of the cards . You 're overdoing it , you ham . Mr. Whitney , my men tell me they have found two rifles in your wagon . Traveling in this wilderness , one must take defense measures . And you 're on your way to Pima ? Yes , yes , an engagement there . And you lost your way ? Mm . I 'm looking forward to seeing your performance this evening . That 's a very tough and cool customer . Agreed . Still has to be another way out of here . You finish setting up . I 'm going to take a look around . Well ? I still think he 's nothing but a fancy-hatted dude , Mr. Avery . Harmless as a baby jackrabbit . We can 't afford the luxury of thinking . Mason , round up the boys , and we 'll find out just how harmless he is . Howdy . Howdy , Mr. Mason . Nice to see you again . You know , that 's one fancy hat you got there , Mr. Play Actor . Oh , thank you very much . You know , I ain 't been able to get that pretty hat out of my thoughts . Mr. Mason ... Hey , Chuck , you ever seen a hat like that ? Well , now that you mention it , I ain 't . Mr. Mason , I don 't want any trouble . What did you call me ? All right , Jim , that 's enough . We got to play the game their way . Chuck , you 're going to let him call me that ? Oh , I don 't know why I should . Come on , you can do better than that . Hold it . I must apologize for my men , Mr. Whitney . They can get a little boisterous . Boisterous ? Rowdies , that 's what they are , Mr. Avery . Rowdies . Yeah , he 's harmless all right , Mr. Avery . Yeah , it certainly appears that way , doesn 't it ? Yeah , if he was a federal man , he 'd sure know how to take care of himself . Wouldn 't take that kind of a beating . But suppose he was a bounty hunter ? There 's still a generous price on my head , Chuck . How you going to go about finding that out ? By giving him his opportunity . Mr. Whitney ... I do regret what happened . The feeling 's mutual . I would like to make amends . Oh , don 't bother . There 's no bother , Mr. Whitney . I was on my way to enjoy a little sport . Why don 't you join me ? Sport , Mr. Avery ? Hunting . I find it relaxing and , uh , a wonderful way for men to get to know each other . I don 't know anything about hunting . He doesn 't even know which end of the rifle to hold . We 'll be ready to leave in half an hour , Mr. Whitney . Do you call this " sport , " Mr. Avery ? My own private hunting preserve , Mr. Whitney . I doubt if many men can lay claim to such a luxury . I suppose I 'll miss all of this when I leave . You 're leaving ? Oh , yes , of course . Greener pastures , you might say . Canada , Europe ... It all depends on the financial gains I realize here . From what I 've seen , you 've been quite successful . Then you 've seen the wanted posters on John Avery , huh ? Tell me , Mr. Whitney , do they do me justice ? Well , let 's say they show a healthy interest in you . Last I heard , it was $ 10,000 . Oh , it 's up to 15 now . Ooh . I feel honored . Imagine what a man like you could do with $ 15,000 . For a man who knows nothing about rifles , you caught that quite professionally . Well , it was an accident . Pure instinct . $ 15,000 , Mr. Whitney . Doesn 't instinct make you want to point that rifle at me and pull the trigger ? You 're not a stupid man , Mr. Avery . I have no interest in the money , but even if I did , how far do think I 'd get with ... blanks ? Blanks , Mr. Whitney ? Hey , Whitney ! Come on , Mr. Avery wants to see you . But we 're preparing for the show . Mr. Avery says now . Trouble ? Let 's hope not . At least not till I finish my soliloquy . This is hardly what I 'd expect from a man of Mr. Avery 's tastes . Mr. Whitney ? Yes . Won 't you come in ? Please ? Thank you . Mr. Avery sure is a gentleman of elegant taste , ain 't he ? That would be a difficult point to argue . Listen , um , that show wagon , is it really yours ? Mm-hmm . Oh , gosh . I feel like I know you . Really ? Uh-huh . You see , I used to be in the entertainment business , too . Laurie Morgan ? I used to sing in San Francisco . Oh , oh , how lovely . Uh-huh . And of course a showperson always feels close to another showperson . It 's sort of like family . That 's how I always feel , Laurie , yes . Oh , I can hardly wait to see your show tonight . Maybe we could convince you to sing with us . Oh , gosh . Oh , I 'd like that . And I have got this outfit that I used to wear in San Francisco ... No , Laurie . I 'm sorry . I wouldn 't think it proper . I 'm glad you could come , Mr. Whitney . I thought we 'd have a brandy together before your performance . I 'd like that very much . Why don 't you get your wrap , my dear . There 's no need to hurry . This elegance , Mr. Whitney , I suppose it surprises you ? I wouldn 't have expected anything less from a man like you , Mr. Avery . Although I must admit I was bit confused by the entrance . Small precaution . If this town were suddenly to be overrun , who would bother with a deteriorated storefront ? True . Very true . Then there are other precautions . I 'm a cautious man , Mr. Whitney . To your health , sir . To yours . Mr. Whitney , I can 't help wondering why our paths never crossed back in Washington . Traveling in different circles perhaps . Mm-hmm , perhaps . But you probably do know why I had to leave Washington . Hmm , well , yes , I ... I heard rumors . Good choice of a word , Mr. Whitney . Well , I know you 're anxious to get back . You may leave the way you came . Oh , you will be at the performance ? Of course . Don 't start until I get there . Laurie , are you ready ? And , Mr. Whitney , I 'd appreciate it very much if you would escort Miss Morgan to your wagon . I 'll be along shortly . My pleasure . That 's him , Mr. Avery - James West . Out here on orders from Washington . He needs to be taken care of . Oh , he will be . There 's no rush . Where can he go ? And you did say his orders were to take me back ... alive . Strange man Avery . Oh . Yeah , you might sort of say that . You met him in San Francisco ? Mm-hmm . He was very nice . Elegant gentleman and all that . And now you 're afraid of him . Look , um ... I think we better talk about something else , huh ? You don 't trust me , Laurie . I saw your face in there . I see the fear on it now . Look , I just met you . I don 't want any trouble . I 'll scream . He 's got a lot of men around here . I want to help you , Laurie . Remember what you said ? Like family almost . Well ... gee , you look like the right kind of gentleman and all that , but , uh , why would you want to stick out your neck for me ? Well , it 's my neck . When I leave here , I may be able to get you out in my wagon . Oh ... sure . Just like in a storybook . Why don 't you trust me , Laurie ? You don 't know Mr. Avery . He isn 't fooled so easy . Isn 't it worth a try ? Try what ? He 's got this place locked in like it was a prison . But I think there 's another way out . A way only Avery knows . Hasn 't he ever mentioned anything like that , Laurie ? Look , mister , you 're going to get us killed . Now , come on , let 's go over to your show before somebody sees us in here like this . Ooh . That didn 't feel like no family . Wasn 't meant to . Abracadabra . And now , for my next act of prestidigitation . Yay ! Yoo-hoo ! And now to prove that the hand is quicker than the eye . Hand sure is quicker . Please continue , Mr. Whitney . There 'll be no further vulgar behavior . Thank you . And as I said , to prove that the hand is quicker than the eye ... Oh ! When you get the opportunity , go out back and invite Mr. Whitney to have supper with us after the performance . And now my friends , it is an honor to introduce to you the next performer . Direct from a triumphant tour before the crown heads of Europe , that great dramatic star , Mr. Artemus Gordon . To be ... or not to be , that is the question . Whether ' tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , or to take arms against a sea of troubles , and by opposing , end them ? To die to sleep no more , and by that sleep , say we end the heartache and the thousand natural ... Well , I just had to make sure it had nothing to do with family . Now , listen , I 've got a feeling you 're in trouble . Uh , Mr. Avery wanted me to invite you to supper after the show tonight . But I don 't know . I think it 's something else . Like what , Laurie ? Well , there was a man who came to see him earlier . Now , I didn 't hear much , but I 'm quite sure it had something to do with you . The man - who is he ? A lawman Mr. Avery has on his payroll . Thanks , Laurie . Mm . But that 's the last time I 'm helping you - no more . From now on , you are on your own , hmm ? Oh . Oh . You know , gentlemen like you really confuse me . Thus conscience does make cowards of us all . And thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o 'er with the pale cast of thought . Oh , what it feels like to get back on the stage . Just listen to that . Congratulations . Thank you . Excuse me . I hate to pull the plug on your success , but Avery knows who we are . Avery knows ? Excuse me . How ? Good guess would be our friend Marshal Kirby . It 's good thing Avery 's the kind of man who enjoys playing games . Ah , especially when he holds all the cards . What do we do now ? Like Avery , we play games . Mmm . Yes , Mr. Whitney . Playing games . Oh , I find I must disagree with you , sir . I hardly consider the theatrical profession as playing games . Come now , Mr. Whitney . Doesn 't the ... the true actor cast aside his cloak of reality to , uh ... well , lose himself in an assumed role ? Mm , of course , but not as a game . Ah . Then for a purpose , perhaps ? game and purpose . But wouldn 't that apply to almost any walk of life ? As Shakespeare said , " All the world is a stage , and men and women merely players . " " And one man in his time plays many parts . " Ah , Mr. Avery , you know Shakespeare . No . I know people and life , Mr. Whitney . Well , right here and now , this room , all of this could be a stage . And you and I , merely players . Possibly . But we couldn 't know that till the curtain went up , could we ? The curtain may already be up , Mr. Whitney . We could be waiting for it to come down . ¶ I dream of Jeannie with the light brown ... ¶ Hey , you . What are you doing out here ? Get over here . Oh , please ... Please forgive me , uh , kind , sir , but I am newly come from the heady wine of theatrical triumph . Yeah . You been hitting that jug , all right . Oh , sir , my performance tonight ... Why surely you recall a magnificent ovation that was given to me ? No . I got stuck with this here guard duty . Now you get on back over to your wagon . You mean you missed my performance ? That 's appalling . But never fear , sir , you shall not be deprived of the right to sit at the table of cultural ambrosia . " Am - " what ? No , sir . You shall be granted a personal performance . Hold on now . O that this too , too solid flesh would melt , thaw , and resolve itself into a dew . Cut that out . But two months dead , nay , not so much , not two so excellent a king , that was , to this Hyperion to a satyr , so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly . Heaven and earth ! Must I remember ? Alas , poor Yorick . I knew him well . Excellent dinner , Mr. Avery . My compliments . Thank you . My dear , I know how cigar smoke disturbs you . Oh , no ! But it does . Brandy , Mr. Whitney ? Please . Thank you . Well , one would think we were back in Washington . A pleasant thought . Yes . The two of us back in Washington together . That would please you , wouldn 't it , Mister , uh ... West ... isn 't it ? James West . You 're a clever and brave man , Mr. West , and I appreciate that . And you 're going to find it a shame to have to kill me , correct ? On the contrary , I expect to find it a pleasure . Guard ! Come in here ! I 'm sure , Mr. West , that you will be delighted to learn that you will be buried with full military honors . A turn of the cards , Mr. Avery . There 's still an entire deck to be played , Mr. West . He acts like he 's holding the winning hand . Maybe he is . We still have to get him out of here . Well , Mr. West , you got in , and you 've got me ... Now , how do you propose to get out ? Laurie ? ! It 's all right . I 'm going to ask you to help us , to help yourself . That other way out ... where is it ? Don 't worry , we 'll take you with us . But I can 't ; he 'll kill me . There is no other way out , Mr. West . If there were , do you think that I would be foolish enough to divulge it to her ? It 's your one chance , Laurie . It 's your one chance to escape . What do you think he 'll do when he tires of you ? You think he 'll let you leave ? He 's right , Laurie . You know it . Easy ... Gadzooks . Very ingenious , Mr. Avery . A clever emergency exit . And since this is an emergency , shall we ? But first ... You wouldn 't mind putting your hands behind your back , would you ? It 's quite damp down there , Mr. Gordon . How do you like that ? He 's still playing it like a winning hand . I better have a look down there , Jim . Still concerned , Mr. West ? Still cautious , Mr. Avery . You better get a wrap , Laurie . Now , I wouldn 't like to be gagged , Mr. West . Do you think that I would cry out for help ? All clear down there , Jim . My hat , Mr. West , if you please . No , I 'd prefer the black one , please . Magnificent . I command a loyal group of followers , Mr. West . Well , then I guess it 's just about that time . I 'm sure Grandfather will forgive me . Shall we continue , Mr. Avery ? I don 't seem to have much choice , do I ? Lead on , MacDuff . You better wait here . Right . Mr. Avery ! You all right up there ? Yes , fine , Chuck . Good work . Just be patient . As I said , Mr. West , I 'm a cautious man . That was a prearranged signal - this black hat . Leaving the white one behind told my men I was in trouble . Also , a $ 20,000 reward for the men who rescue me . The winning hand . I 'm going to need that rifle . Let 's get rid of the horses ! There 's no more than eight of them out there . Perhaps I should say seven . Looks like your boys don 't want to spread the reward too thin . There are more of them on the way . And you had to blow up this tunnel . You 've locked yourself in , West . There 's no way out . Perhaps you 'd like to discuss some sort of deal ? Perhaps you 'd like to discuss some sort of deal ? I can just see a cold-blooded butcher like you letting us go . Artemus , do that again . What ? Avery 's voice . What ? Oh , you mean ... Perhaps you 'd like to discuss some sort of deal ? You 'll have to pardon my rudeness . Laurie ... watch him . Artemus , you 're about to give the greatest performance of your career . Curtain 's up , Artemus . Chuck , this is Avery . Hold your fire . Can you hear me ? Yes , I hear you , Mr. Avery . West is giving up . It 's all over , men . It worked . Let 's get the others . Where are the other fireworks ? Oh . Take Laurie and put her in the last car . Right . Well , Mr. Avery , shall we ? Hey , wasn 't that Mr. Avery they just dumped in the car ? It sure was . Everybody all right ? A final turn of the cards , Mr. Avery . The engineer tells me that steam is up , sir , and we are ready to press on . It 's a long trip to Chicago , Mr. Avery . You can ride with me , or we do have a rolling cell up forward . I 'd like your promise , though , that you don 't try and escape . However , the choice is yours . Don 't be ridiculous , West . The rolling cell , of course . Well , at least you 'll have company in the form of U.S. Marshal Kirby . I 'll show you to your quarters , sir . And , Laurie , I 'm sure I have your promise that you won 't try to escape on the long trip to Chicago . Oh , gosh , all this elegance , Mr. West . Why , it ought to be real fun traveling clear to Chicago in such fancy style . Not to mention the fun of a fascinating traveling companion . Oh , but Chicago , Mr. West . I don 't know a soul in Chicago . What would I do there all by myself ? My dear , the name Artemus Gordon is sheer magic in Chicago theatrical circles . It can open doors . Really , Mr. Gordon ? Oh , I would deem it a pleasure , Laurie . Now with all that settled , on our way to Chicago , right ? Wrong . I 'm heading the other way . You see , gentleman like you still confuse me . Oh . I guess simple girls like me should just never leave home . Bye . Artemus , it 's going to be a long trip to Chicago . James , my boy , you just can 't win them all .

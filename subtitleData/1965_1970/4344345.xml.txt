 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . Guard . ! Here are the prisoners . ! Where are you ? Onto the beach . Move . You think I wanna be stranded here ? My ship leaves in minutes . Help him . Move . [ Whispering ] Now ! - Halt ! Halt ! - [ Gunfire ] [ Coughing ] - Don 't move . - Wait a minute . Keep your mouth shut . Not a word . You would not have made it anyway . All right . Move along . Henri Boudaire , Pierre Blanc ... Andre Perrault , Claude Dumas ... Andre Vermere , Marcel Duchamps . Very good . All accounted for . There 's some mistake here . We - [ Chuckles ] You 'd be better off if I killed you here and now . But no matter . It 'll all be the same in the end . Gentlemen , welcome to Devil 's Island . This is the ultimate punishment , gentlemen . Keep that in mind . You are the elite , the political prisoners ... whose ideas might be infectious . Therefore you have been isolated on this small section ... of the smallest of our three islands - only a few hundred feet long and a few hundred feet wide . We are known as the Second Barracks . No one has ever escaped from it . So we will have no more of that foolish attempt of this morning . The sharks in the waters that surround us are numerous and hungry . You will spend the rest of your lives here , make no mistake about that . If you resign yourself to it , your lives might be long . If not - - They 're all yours , Sergeant . - Yes , sir . Sir - Prisoners are not allowed to talk to the commandant . Well , then , hear us out yourself , Sergeant . There 's been a mistake . We don 't belong here . ! Just check your records . We 're not even listed there . Well , if there is a mistake , we 'll find it eventually . - Eventually ? - Yes . And until that mistake is discovered ... you are 861 0 . And 861 0 is as mortal as any other prisoner . Ifhe disobeys , he dies . Don 't forget that . We 're American citizens . You have no right to keep us here . The only reason you 're alive now is because it 's the first day . Lescaux is always lenient on the first day . You open your mouth to me once more ... I promise you you 'll pray for death . Distribute the uniforms . You will change clothes in the barracks . Take nothing with you - no possessions , no pictures , nothing . The only thing you have here is what we give you . I know one thing : We don 't cross him . He means what he says . I 'm sure he does ... but I don 't intend to spend the rest of my life in this place . We 're gonna have to just concentrate on keeping alive . [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . [ Lescaux ] Attach your leg irons . Affix the locks . You will be the keeper of the barracks . You will bring the water and see that the rest of the pigs keep it clean . Hmm ? - [ Prisoner Coughs ] - No noise will be tolerated . Any disturbance , your rations will be cut in half . It 's useless to fight the iron , Marcel . - You know I 'm not Marcel . - Marcel . Andre . What does it matter ? - How long have you been here ? - Just arrived on the island . I 've been a guest of the prison administration for three years . I was in the army , and I questioned the wisdom ... of the French colonial policy to one of my officers . Three years . How much longer they gonna keep you here ? I doubt that anyone remembers that I exist at all . Perhaps my wife . Yes . She remembers . The escape attempt was foolish this morning . You heard what he said about sharks . There 's got to be some way out . Come on , old man . Tell him about your escape . Tell him . Three of us went in the jungles of Venezuela . One went mad . Mosquitoes , insects , millions . The other was captured by the Indians . He died slow . I could hear him . There was nothing I could do . I had a fever ... a terrible fever . That 's enough . Go to sleep . - How long was he free ? - Less than a week . [ Coughing ] He 'll be out of it soon . - Here . Pass this to him . - It 's a waste of good water . Thank you . - More ? - No . Is there a doctor here on this island ? What would they need a doctor for ? The sooner we are finished , the better for them ... the more they would like it . Sometimes I think I would like to live forever , just to embarrass them . Henri Boudaire , the army lieutenant who tried to ... uncover graft in the army of his country . The eternal Henri Boudaire . - You mean you 've never thought of escape ? - I am here ... because I was betrayed by a man whom I considered my best friend . I don 't trust anyone . - Can 't you refine your time lock ? - No . I 'm holding on Doug 's signal . Without anything specific to go on ... it could be anywhere in time from 1 852 right on up to 1 930 . - What did you find on the uniforms ? - No help there . As far as I can find out , there was no change in penal uniforms that can help pinpoint the year . - How about the prisoners ' names ? - I 'm running that through now . [ Printer Clacking ] Another dead end . [ Sighs ] Most of the records of the French penal colonies were destroyed in the mid - ' 30s . You know , there must be something in that barracks that would give us the exact date . Perhaps there is . - The numbers . - What about the numbers ? The prisoners were given consecutive numbers , which means that ... approximately 8,600 prisoners were interned in Devil 's Island before Doug and Tony got there . Now , just possibly , somewhere , there might be a record ... of the numbers and the years they were issued . All right . Get on the phone and call Major Hicks with the American embassy in Paris . - He can cut through the red tape . Give it immediate priority . - Yes , sir . You 'd better get that information fast , General . We could lose them at any time . - Any luck ? - No . - What about you ? - They have no will to escape . None of them will even listen to me ... and the odds are 1 00-to-1 against our getting out of here alive by ourselves . The odds 'll be worse than that if we stay . If I could only get to the commandant . Maybe I could make him listen to reason . All right . Go now . - What about Lescaux ? - I 'll take care of him.Just watch your chance . I can 't work without water . None of us can . [ Lescaux ] You 'll get water at noon . Get back to work . - [ Tony ] By noon I might be dead . I want some now . - You 'll be dead before noon ... - unless you get back to work . - [ Man Screaming ] The man 's dead . Bury him . His death saved your life . Next time you might not be so lucky . Get back to work ! How did you get in here ? Do you know the penalty for what you 're doing ? I have some idea , but I think it 's worth the risk . I have to talk to you , and this is the only way I could do it . Well , if a man is willing to risk his life for the sake of a little conversation ... then the least I can do is to oblige him . If the pistol makes you nervous , by all means , take it . - Cigarette ? - No , thank you . Commandant , my friend and I are here by mistake . I should say right in the beginning that , uh ... no man is ever on Devil 's Island by mistake . We are . My friend and I were part ... of a scientific expedition that somehow went awry and landed on this island . We were picked up in the escape attempt yesterday . Six men were sent here . Six arrived . And the description on your records fit you and your friend very closely . - Is that merely a coincidence ? - Commandant , I 'm only asking you to check it out . - Where 's your central headquarters ? - St. Laurents . Well , ask them to notify you . Ask them to send you a complete description ... of the two men we somehow replaced . Yes . I suppose that would be possible ... although it 's inconceivable that anybody would be imprisoned here by accident . I would need some paper . Go ahead . - Now , what are your names ? - I 'm Douglas Phillips ... and my friend 's name is Anthony Newman . - And your nationalities ? - American . Yes , that should do it . It will take a little while until we hear back from St. Laurents . But , on the presumption of the doubt you have raised ... I think it 's only fitting that you should be moved out of the barracks . - We 'd appreciate that . - Shall we see about your friend Newman ? Oh , and , uh , I don 't think you will need that any longer , do you ? I 'm greatly relieved , Commandant . This isn 't exactly the spot I 'd picked for my vacation . Drop your pistol to the floor ! I mean it . Drop your pistol . Put your hands on your head ... and back against that wall . Move very slowly . [ Horn Blaring ] [ Commandant ] Take him away and assemble the prisoners . I think it is time that we made our first example . All right . Get in . There is no reprieve here . There are only the rules . You will live by them , or you will die by them . - You are Captain Alfred Dreyfuss ? - I am . You 've been assigned to my jurisdiction , Captain . You will be given your own quarters pending the outcome of your appeal in Paris . I request no special favors . I demand only what is due every Frenchman : justice . Guard ! Take Captain Dreyfuss to his quarters . I tell you , I saw him . A guard was taking him into headquarters . Impossible . They would not bring Captain Dreyfuss to Devil 's Island . Dreyfuss ? Here ? Forget it , old man . I know the captain . I served under him . He 's an honorable man . Nobody would ever think he 's guilty of treason . I heard of his trial . They said he betrayed France . He sold military secrets to Germany . The evidence against him was forged . They would never find him guilty . But that one saw him here . So you say you are an American ? How would you know Dreyfuss ? His trial was covered by the American press . I saw a picture of him . A man like Dreyfuss cannot be left to die in a place like this . If he 's here , we have to get him out . [ Approaching Footsteps ] It 's still filthy . Do it over . [ Laughing ] [ Spits ] Pig ! I 'm going to kill him ! You wanna give him an excuse to kill you ? Is that what you want ? Someday I 'll see him dead . Where did you get that iron bar ? I picked it up near the supply hut . If anyone wants a broken head ... let him try to take it from me . - We 're losing our signal , General . - Well , keep at it . - We can 't afford to lose them . - It just came out of the computer . Alfred Dreyfuss arrived on Devil 's Island on the 1 5th of March , 1 895 . All right . We 'll go for a time fix . How long can a man live in a sweatbox like that , General ? I don 't know . I do know that in the prison camps in Malaya ... some of them lasted three days . But French Guiana 's on the equator . The ground temperature there hits 1 50 degrees . - [ Kirk ] What do you need to get him out ? - We now have a time fix . - We need a spatial fix as well . - Ann , contact Paris again . Tell them what we know and tell them I want a layout of the Second Barracks ... in 1 895 as exact as they can make it . Yes , sir . - [ Guard ] Here 's some water . - [ Lescaux ] No . No , no . No water there . The guards to be relieved will report to the boat landing ... on the morning of the 1 7 th at 7 : 00 . [ Guard ] But that 's gonna leave only four men on guard here . Only for a few hours . Besides , it doesn 't matter . The convicts aren 't going anywhere . [ Clanking ] - Where are you going ? - I 'm going to see Dreyfuss . I 'm going with you . [ Creaking ] If it is Captain Dreyfuss , they will have him in a special hut for important prisoners . [ Whispering ] All right . Follow me . What is this ? Who are you ? Capitaine Dreyfuss , don 't you remember me ? - Henri Boudaire . - Boudaire ? I was with you at the ministry . ' 89 . Yes . Of course . - But what are you doing on Devil 's Island ? - Why are any of us here ? Sir , we have come to help you . [ Chuckling ] Boudaire , the party 's breaking up . - They 'll be making a bed check soon . - We are planning an escape . Escape ? For you , that is right , Boudaire . Get back to France . Fight those who have forgotten what France stands for . Fight them . Fight them with all your heart and soul . - May I take this ? - Yes . Of course . It 's there . You must see it . - What are you talking about ? - The boat . Behind you . Look through the trees . We are going to have a look . Cover for us . - Can you navigate ? - Of course . I spent six years at sea before I went into the army . - We are going to need provisions . - Claude has access to the mess hall . - What about a sail ? - Perrault . He was a tailor in the old days . He can make a sail out of blankets . Good . All right . Everybody back to work . This is the location of the barracks . This is where Tony is , and this is where Doug is . - Do you have the coordinates , General ? - Mm-hmm . For Tony : .01 6 by 3.97 . For Doug : 936.1 ... by 7 66 even . - All right . I 've got them . - How are you going to get both of them in the same retrieve ? Well , we 'll have to arrange a power split . We have Tony here and Doug there . Roughly , we 'll be splitting one retrieving power , and we 'll pick them both up at once . Are you sure that you can control the split accurately ? Can 't be sure of anything , General , except that once they make an escape attempt ... and get out into that jungle , our odds go down . I know this is a new procedure , but I think it 's worth trying . - When do you wanna make a try ? - Well , we 're at maximum power now . I say that we should try as soon as they 're both in position . All right . All right , we 'll go ahead . - Doug , are you all right ? - [ Panting ] Well , I 'm alive , thanks to that water you brought me . Tony , I heard the guards talking about Dreyfuss . - Is he here ? - Yes . He 's here . We 're organizing an escape . The men are gonna get Dreyfuss out . But you know as well as I do , Dreyfuss never got off Devil 's Island . If they try to take him with them , their escape is going to fail . I know Dreyfuss can 't be included ... but you can 't tell them that . He 's the whole reason for their will to escape . What 's gonna happen when you try to talk them out of taking him ? I don 't know . I 'll have to cross that bridge when I come to it . [ Door Unlatching ] Take your places . Put on your leg irons . Bring us up to full power . All right , Ann . Synchronize your signals . Signals are synchronized . - Did you get supplies ? - I got it . It 's in the keg . Bread and tinned beef . It 's the only thing I could get . - It 'll do . - Did you get the needles ? It 's there . A small package . And I found some barrel staves we can use for oars . - They 're in the boat . - It 's now or never . Activate . Now , in just a few more moments , and that 's it ; you 're free . [ Electrical Charges Firing ] [ Electrical Charges Firing ] The retrieving power didn 't split . We 've picked up the wrong man , General . You have nothing to fear , Boudaire . Nobody 's going to hurt you . Put your guns away ! I don 't want him hurt ! Sorry . That 'll be all . Boudaire , I am General Kirk ... and this is Dr. Swain and Dr. MacGregor . How do you know my name ? What is this place ? You 're in the United States , and this is the year 1 968 . 1 968 . Boudaire , we don 't expect you to comprehend this all at once ... but we 're trying to rescue two of our men who are on Devil 's Island by mistake . But we had an accident and picked you up instead . You did not answer my question . You - How do you know my name ? Ann ? If only we 'd been where Boudaire was standing ... we 'd be back in the Time Tunnel now . - [ Laughter ] - It 's Lescaux . He 's coming back . So , the sleep of the innocent , I see . But not so innocent perhaps , ah ? [ Grunts ] Supply reports some tins of beef are missing . All right . We 'll play a different game . Now , you tell me where Boudaire has gone . Huh ? - They 're in there . - Yes . I know that you 're disoriented by your trip through time ... but there are some things that we have to talk about before we send you back . - Send me back ? - The lives of our men depend on your going back . What about my life ? If I go back there , they will kill me . I don 't know what this place is ... but I feel free here . And I have no intention to go anywhere . I will stay here ! [ Inhales Sharply ] Do you have anything to eat here ? I 'll have dinner brought in . Can we send him back to be killed , General , or to spend another 30 years in torture ? - Can we do that to him ? - I don 't know . Meanwhile , order him some food , will you please ? - [ Gasps ] - If you think I will mobilize a full-scale search ... in the middle of the night , you are mistaken . No . There is an easier way . You are going to tell me where Boudaire has gone . You won 't find Boudaire on this island . The same scientific experiment that landed us here took him away . Right out of the barracks , just like that ? Well , ask the other prisoners . They all saw it . - If you 'll give me a chance to explain , I 'm sure I can - - Explain what ? Hallucinations ? Witchcraft ? Commencing at dawn , I will execute one prisoner each hour ... until you have told me where the escaped convict has gone ... or you have told me where he is . And you will be the first ! Take them back to the barracks . He won 't do that . He would not kill them all . You 're the only man who can save their lives and perhaps help Captain Dreyfuss . No , I will not ! Bring them all out of there with your machine ! - You brought me here ! - Boudaire , your coming here was an accident . The machine hasn 't been perfected . Will Dreyfuss take the bait ? The government thinks he will . If he does , they will have Dreyfuss as they would like him ... killed while trying to escape ... together with an unexpected dividend : a few other dead political troublemakers . It 's a trap , a trap to kill Captain Dreyfuss ... to kill all of us ! - Send me back . - Boudaire , you 've been forewarned against making this attempt ... but you 'll have other chances . Is escape from Devil 's Island possible ? Yes . If you go far enough north to stay out of the coastal tides . Those who made it reached Trinidad . The British were sympathetic . I know those waters . I 'm ready to go . You 're a brave man , Boudaire . Ray , start your countdown ... and give me the coordinates for your next retrieve . I 'm not sure we 're doing the right thing , General . We 've never had any guarantees , Ann . I want a weather summary ... for the 1 7th of March , 1 895 , north coast of South America . Yes , sir . Boudaire , there 's something you should know . Captain Dreyfuss is a part of history ... and history records he never escaped from Devil 's Island . If you try to take him with you , you haven 't got a chance . What about me ? Do you know if I will escape ? Sorry . Our records are not that complete . Very well then . I take my chances . Countdown is ready , General . We have the coordinates . Boudaire , tell Newman and Phillips to be at the northwest corner ... of the barracks at exactly 8 : 1 3 . Northwest corner . 8 : 1 3 . According to the computer , there was a high , prevailing easterly wind ... off a high center in the South Atlantic , five to 1 5 knots , variable . - Very good . - Count him down . - How do I do this ? - You just walk straight into the Tunnel . - Good luck . - Boudaire . Ten , nine , eight ... seven , six , five ... - four , three , two , one . - [ Electrical Charges Firing ] All right . Has anybody decided that he wants to live ? Then answer the question : Where is Boudaire ? I tell you , Sergeant . - Yes ? - What you heard is true . He was here one moment and gone the next . The devil took him . The devil take you all . Now you say your prayers . You 're about to die . All right . Now let us go . All right . Check the guards . Perrault ... I 'll need your help to get to the commandant , make sure he doesn 't spread the alarm . You and Claude put the boat in the water . Rig the sail , but don 't hoist it . There are two guards , one near the guillotine and another at headquarters . You take care of the guard at the guillotine . - You only have about 20 minutes to get to the beach . - Right . - I 'll need the pistol . - He can 't get Captain Dreyfuss past the guard by himself . - Don 't worry about it . We 'll handle it . - Dreyfuss is the important one . He must be protected . He 's the whole reason for risking our necks . You do exactly as I say , or none of us 'll get out of here . You take the cask and the water and the food . Now get going . Good luck . - Can you take the guard at the guillotine ? - If we succeed ... I will at last meet two granddaughters I 've never seen . You can count on me . Give me two minutes to get into position . No noise . Stay right where you are . Not a sound out of you , not a move . Keep him covered , Perrault . Put your hands behind you . Oh , my hands are about to drop off . It 's all right . We 'll rest , then I 'll carry it . I - I don 't like this . One of us should have gone with him to set Dreyfuss free . - I 'm going back . - Dreyfuss isn 't going with us . What ? What did you say ? I can 't tell you how I know , but an escape involving Dreyfuss would be doomed to failure . - Let 's get to the boat . - Are you in the pay of the government ? Do you think I would go without Captain Dreyfuss ? You don 't have any choice . - Boudaire ! - Where have you been ? - This one and his friend are giving the orders . - Listen to me . - [ Slap ] - Stop it ! You were picked up by the Time Tunnel , weren 't you ? Then you must know about Dreyfuss . Tell him . ! - Give me the gun , Boudaire ! - No ! A bad dream . That 's what it was . A bad dream . Boudaire , tell him about Dreyfuss ! Dreyfuss isn 't here with you ? The other American was supposed to liberate him . I say we go back and make sure . - Yes . Dreyfuss must be freed . - Give me the rifle . You come with us . Yes . We must free Dreyfuss ! The transfer was too much for him . How long will it take him to snap out of it ? His experience here may never be anything more to him ... than what he calls it : a bad dream . He 's forgotten all about telling Tony and Doug to get ready for a retrieve . We 'll just have to take ' em on the run if we can . Let 's synchronize our signals , Ann . We 'll go back to standby . - An escape ? - Yes , Captain . So you have your chance , Captain Dreyfuss ... and there 's nothing I can do to prevent your escape . One chance in a million . It could never hap - - Are you all right , Captain ? - Yes , yes . Hurry . You don 't have much time . - You 're not coming with us ? - No . The captain never tried to escape from Devil 's Island . Never tri-What are you talking about ? - He means the captain won 't go . - Then I will not go . It is not your choice to make . All of you , your duty is to go ... to defend France against her detractors . My duty is to remain here , all my life , if need be ... as a living reminder that honor must be restored to the army of France . - Go now . - Now , wait a minute . Everything 's been so easy . Everything 's been too easy . Too convenient . The guards being sent away . Our stumbling on a boat that just happened to be in good condition . I say we don 't question providence . The commandant planned it all . Everything was made very easy for us , all of it , so that - So that Captain Dreyfuss would be killed attempting to escape . And the officers of the general staff could be spared much embarrassment . Yes , of course . The commandant planned it all . An ambush ? Where would he have sent the guards ? There are rocks overlooking the beach . That would be the logical place . - Then I say we take them by surprise and kill them . - No . No , the commandant 's been thoughtful enough to plan everything for our convenience . You launch the boat . Tony and I 'll take care of the guards . Mon capitaine . Let us go ! - Captain ? - Yes ? If it 's any comfort to you , you don 't have long to stay here . They 'll take you back to France . You 'll be exonerated . I thank you for your expression of confidence . Good luck . Captain . [ Boudaire ] They will never catch us ! Come on ! Look at the blessed fog ! They will never catch us ! You , citizen , come here . - Stop or we shoot ! - Come here , citizen . - What do you want ? - You are under arrest . - Arrest ? What have I done ? - [ Guffaws ] Quite a sight , citizen . What are they doing with that man ? He 's on his way to the guillotine . Another aristocrat . That proud head will soon be in a basket . [ Tony ] Doug .

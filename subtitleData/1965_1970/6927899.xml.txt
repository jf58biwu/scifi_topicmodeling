 DESTROY ALL MONSTERS UNITED NATIONS SCIENCE COMMITTEE SPACE PORT ll The year is 1999 . The United Nations Scientific Committee has established ... an exploratory base on the moon . A rocket base is also functioning on the earth . And spacecraft leave for the moon on a daily schedule . " Moonlight SY-3 ... " " Stand by ! " " Ten , " " nine , " " eight , " " seven , " " six , " " five , " " four , " " three , " " two , " " one , " " zero ! " An underwater base was recently established near Ogasawara Island and scientists are studying the habits of marine life . New kinds of fish are being bred here , while on land , all of the earth 's monsters have been collected and are living together in a place called Monsterland . Godzilla . Rodan . Anguiras . Mothra and Gorosaurus . If the monsters try to leave the safety provided for them ... a special control apparatus goes into operation . They are confined within scientific walls . Each with recordings of their own instincts and habits of them . Rodan flies within a limited area of water that is shelled by a magnetic wall . There is food in abundance here . The monsters are free to eat as much of it as they please . Everything is automatically controlled here . From a control center that is situated deep within the earth . Is CHX alright ? Yes , it 's okay . That 's good . The monsters look cute when you look at them from this angle . - Yes , they do . Well , I 'm glad you agree . I was afraid it would frighten you . - Oh no . Now , your job will be to help them . Make a thorough study of them . - Right . " Phone call for Manabe . " " A long distance call is waiting for you on panel number 4 . " Take it . Hi . Yo .. it 's Katsuo ! Where are you ? I 'm at the moon base . - What ? - This phone call cost alot . Oh . I was very worried about you on that island . You have , huh ? Wait and see , that everything is fine . Right , I really wasn 't worried about you . I was more worried about Godzilla . Bull ... . But , I really think that monsters are here too . Is that so ? Well , maybe . I can 't say for sure , but it worries me . Can you put Dr. Yoshida on the phone now ? The chief 's in Tokyo now attending a committee meeting . Well , when he comes back ... Hello ? Hello ? What 's wrong ? Hello ! Hello ! Power station ! Power station ! This is the operating chief ! Power station , what 's wrong ? What 's going on ? I can 't understand it . Oh , wait . The control apparatus , it 's out of order . What 's causing this ? Now , we 'll investigate this right away . - Right . First , check out the throttle section . No good . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . Doctor ! Whoa .. Gas ! Hurry up ! Suddenly , all communication has been cut off from Monsterland . The United Nations Scientific Committee has called a special meeting in Tokyo and is now in the process of establishing contact with Ogasawara Island . Number 6 has Ogasawara . - Focus . Amplify . - Right . No good . Some one 's jamming us . Once more . Try to get them again . Doctor , this is deliberately induced . I fully agree with you . But just who would cause it ? Doctor , look . This is terrible . It 's changed so . Maybe volcanic action ? No . Amplify it again . - Right . That 's coral build-up of dust . Those people 's lives are in great danger . This is a Special Broadcast , from radio Moscow . This is radio Moscow reporting . Rodan has suddenly attacked Moscow . It 's Rodan . The attack started at 11 : 00 o 'clock . And now he is destroying everything in the city . Rodan , who has come to Moscow must have come from Ogasawara Island . It 's in Moscow ? What 's going on with him ? This is Paris . Radio Paris reporting . A subterranean of terror has just broken through the ground . The Arc de Triomphe , is about to be destroyed by the monster . But , the monument is holding . The Arc de Triomphe is crumbling down ! The beast is destroying the heart of Paris completely destroying it . The major cities in the world are being destroyed one by one by the monsters . Moscow , ... .. by Rodan . Beijing , ... ..... by Mothra . and London , ... ... by Manda . Paris , ... ................. by Baragon . Here 's a special news bulletin . Godzilla is now in New York City . The city is being invaded by Godzilla . - Doctor ? What do you think has caused this ? - How did the monsters escape ? - Couldn 't you foresee this ? We are not trying to conceal anything , Gentlemen . The truth of the matter , gentlemen , is we don 't know what has happened . - Is that true Doctor ? All I can say now , ... is what I thought twenty years ago . Remember that Typhoon ? We must be on our guard . Quiet ! Quiet ! We know nothing . Everyone of us fears the very same thing . We 're trying to find the answer to this . - But Captain Yoshida , Monsterland is close by , so why wasn 't Tokyo attacked ? I 'd like to know that answer myself ! Now , please , just .. I 'm sorry . " Moonlight SY-3 . " Moonlight SY-3 ! " This is Moonlight SY-3 , over . " Return to the base . " Why ? What 's wrong ? " You 'll find out . Hurry and come back . Huh ? Hey ! Track it ! - Right . We can 't let it get away . But ... we have to return . Hold on a minute . That 's a UFO out there . This is too dangerous . What is it ? " Moonlight SY-3 ! " " Moonlight SY-3 , what 's wrong ? " Damn it . Go . What 's going on down there ? Is it some kind of an emergency ? Is that why they called and asked for our help ? They didn 't ask for us to help . Then , what do they want ? They want us to return . We 'll guide you , in a few moments . The landing place is Monsterland . You 'll go underneath the ground . I know you 're the only people who can do this job . Watch out , for possible trouble . Should we be armed ? Yes . Watch yourselves . Alright . We 're on it . We 're on the guiding beam . Alright , let 's go . Everyone , get ready to land ! Reverse engines , okay . Hang on everyone ! This is Moonlight SY-3 . We 're now at the entrance to the control center . Good . Some creature has taken over there . Your job is to find out what it is . This is dangerous . So watch your step . - Right . Gas and acid , but , it checks out alright .. Good . Let 's go . Careful . - Right . Hey ! Look ! - Well , welcome back to Earth . Kyoko ! Doctor ! Have a good trip ? What 's going on around here ? I didn 't think that you 'd really come here . Can you explain this ? Doctor ! Don 't get yourself so excited . I want all of you to co-operate with us , things will run alot smoother then . Co-operate ? What do you think you 're talking about . You let all the monsters loose when the Chief was gone . No , you 're wrong . We 're controlling them from here . Remote control ? Watch the screen . Mothra , is now near Beijing . Godzilla is at sea . And Rodan is flying . If we want to call these monsters back , it 's a simple process . Now , I 'll introduce you to the inventor of this scheme . Follow me . Come this way . I 've been waiting for you . And now , I have a question for you . I want you to know that I am not your enemy . It is my duty to build , a new scientific civilization on Earth , with the help of you people . You just destroyed some of our major cities . Now , who are you ? ! Katsuo ! Why don 't you let her finish her story ? Listen , Kyoko ! When we develop this new scientific civilization. we 'll have to sacrifice alot . What 's that ? Where are you from ? Kilaak . Kilaak ? From Outer Space . There are many small planets , moving between Mars and Jupiter . And this Lady , comes from one them . - Do you really believe that ? - Yes , I do . I highly respect this person , because of her scientific ability . The remote control unit is just one example . She 's truly great . A living genius . Okada , come back ! See ? Better give up . You can not penetrate that wall . What were you doing ? You 're coming with me . Where are the others ? They 're all alright , why don 't you leave them alone . You better call them . Don 't bother with them . Can you join us ? No , I won 't . And I 'm taking some of you out here . Captain 's , right . Now get ready to leave . Now move ! It 's Gas ! Quick ! Stop ! Hurry it up ! Captain ! Quick ! Hurry up ! Hurry up ! Here 's the masks ! Catch her ! Take him to the ship ! Kyoko ! Kyoko ! Look out ! Look out ! Get back ! Get back ! Captain ! Captain ! I see the Captain ! Okay , let 's go ! What 's happened to you , Doctor ? Have you been brainwashed ? He won 't answer any of our questions . Something 's wrong with him . Doctor Otani . If you want to be saved , you 'll have to answer our questions . Understand ? I think that he 's crazy . He 's keeping quiet , because he knows too much ! The self defense force , is standing by , to protect us . We 've checked out the island , And no one is there . Tell us where their new base of operation is and of course , we 'll go easy on you . Don 't you care what happens to you now ? What now ? Doctor ! - Don 't touch him . You ! You all are slaves to the people of Kilaak . Come with us quietly . And you won 't get hurt . Now . Come on . Where are you taking that man ? You be quiet ! Or these . They can use these on your skin . The secret police . Let 's scram . Hey ! Hurry ! Wait ! - Scalpel . Was he hard of hearing ? No . It 's not a hearing aid . It 's hard to tell what it is . But , I think it 's some kind of metal . I can tell you right now , this is some sort of medical transmitter . But why would they put something like this inside his body ? Doctor . Is this how he controls the monsters ? I agree . Dr. Otani must have been killed by the same device . That 's right . And those Kilaak people were probably afraid that we 'd find out about this . They must be sending radio waves from somewhere . If we can find these waves , we can jam them . Alright , I begin my search for the source of the waves from the sky . We 've got something ! Check out where it comes from ! - Right . The waves are coming from a mountain area . I 'm busy . I don 't know what kind of a stone it is , but I don 't have any time to take it somewhere to have it examined . What the hell ? Officer ! Huh ? Look up in the sky . Up there look . OH ! What is it ? Oh , it 's that R-Rodan ! It can 't be . Here . What is it ? That looks like the moon rocket SY-3 . Huh ? Maybe I told you , that my young son is on the moon . Yes , I remember . Is he alright ? Yeah . - Huh ? - Huh ? What 's wrong ? We 're checking the waves . - Well , Go right ahead . - Thank you . What 's that ? - Look , they 're using radar . And now it has finally been established by the members of the United Nations Science Committee , that this object , that looks like a stone is being used by the people of the planet Kilaak . They have been manipulating the monsters and throwing ... the entire world into a state of mass panic . It was found in Dover . In Spain , the steeple of a churches . Also , one was found in the Alps . In a very large chunks of ice . In Guam , it was found inside of a coconut . Now , Dr. Yoshida , will give us an explanation . This is object is a special sending and receiving device , that 's limited . We 've estimated its power in terms of kilometers . We can assume the monsters are manipulated by these special machines . Next , in regards to the members captured by the people of Kilaak we presumed they have all returned to their own country . With your co-operation , we will find them very soon . These men are dangerous . Minoru Kudo , age 35 . Tetsuo Ise , age 30 . Shin Kuroiwa , age 28 . Kyoko Manabe , age 23 . Please , watch for this girl . Also , Michael Dawson , age 32 , British descent . Elmer Hughes , age 29 . You 're alright , go ahead . Hi , we 're just going to check for . Thank you very much . Go ahead , please . Thank you . Alright , Go on . Please take shelter ! Rodan is now flying over districts VII and VIII . Everyone , take shelter at once . He 's come at last . Good . The people have all taken shelter . That 's right . An emergency . Godzilla is now in district 1 . What ? Manda ! Manda has arrived . Get ready to attack . Get ready to attack . Now . Ready . Fire . I didn 't think Tokyo would escape this terror but Rodan , Godzilla , and Manda here at the same time ? That 's correct . New York , London , Moscow ... They were all there in ... An Emergency ! An Emergency ! Mothra has appeared in district V. Integrated Defense Headquarters Liaison Conference Center Oh .. The damage is horrible . Yes , Tokyo is in ruins . There were four of them . But the people of Kilaaks , are now set up in Izu . Izu ? The hot springs are dried up . Just like what happened in Monsterland . Think there is some sort of connection there ? Hmm . They 've also got another monster . Baragon ? Mm .. hmm . While all the other cities were being attacked , Tokyo was left alone ? You see , they turned our attention away from Japan to build a new base in Izu . I see . And now I 'll bet that they are using something new . Right , that 's why your job is to find out where they are . You go underground with your spaceship and if you 're lucky , you 'll find them and put an end to these people , once for all . Well , hello . How are you ? I 'm fine . Thank you . Hello . - It 's Kyoko Manabe . Yo .. ? Let 's go to another room . No , I have something I want to say to everyone who is in this room . I know what you 're going to say . I 've heard it all before ! You may not want to hear me , but maybe the others do . Especially the newspaper people . Alright . Where are you from ? From the base at Isu . And what is this base ? It 's a base of operations for all the people of Kilaak . Did you come here to deliver a message to us ? Yes . If all of you agree to let them stay here and will abide by their laws and rules , the monsters will go back and remain living on Ogasawara Island . Unless we agree to these terms , the monsters will destroy all of us . Well , this is just like blackmail ! I 'm talking to the others . You keep quiet . Come here ! What do you want ? Hold ! Hold still ! - Keep still ! Doctor ! This is what controlled her . Dr. Otani , was murdered . And others at Monsterland are being manipulated just like this . Doctor . We will investigate . - Yes . - We 're short of time Kyoko ! Kyoko , wake up ! Kyoko ! She 's alright . And now , we have to help her out . Take it easy . Listen , you 've got to help . We have to know , where this special Kilaaks base is . Kilaaks base ? That 's right . Where is it located in Izu ? I think ... I think ... The poison gas ! Her memory is a complete blank . Because of them . All right . Everyone is ready now for action ! Ground troops are in position ! - Alright . Ready to fire . - Ready to fire . Now , lets go ! - Alright ! SY-3 on target . - Right . Look , there 's Godzilla ! Cut rockets ! Emergency ! All right men . Ready . Fire ! - Ready . Fire ! Hey , what 's wrong ? We 're stuck ! Anguirus ! - Anguirus ? Why that ... Operations halt ! Stop right now ! Oh , no . Well , let 's go back . We lose . So , they won again . Hey ? Let 's follow . Right . It 's headed for Fuji . This has something to do with those Kilaaks . Hurry , check out his bearing . - Right . 15 degrees . Captain , let 's not run away . Let 's fight it . We 'll do that later on . But right now , let 's get out of here . Open all rockets ! - Open all rockets . Open them all the way ! Huh , that 's funny . Rodan was our escort . But , we didn 't find their base . Well , we have some idea where it is . If we investigate the area , we 'll find out where the Kilaaks are . Forward ! Godzilla ! Scatter ! Scatter ! Hurry up ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Quick ! You alright ? I 'm alright . I think this is it . He can 't open it ... It won 't move . It 's a cave alright . Now , let 's find those people . - Right . umph ... Alright , step back . I 'll shoot . It 's no good . Welcome . I 'm glad to see you all again . And now , you will follow us to our base . What 's that ? I lured all of you here today , because I want to tell you something . Lured us ? - Look there . They 're here , all right . That 's it ! Mmm ... Yes , that 's the same spaceship that you saw near the moon . And now what makes you think that we 're from outer space ? That 's right . What do you have on your mind ? Peace terms . Peace terms ? Our mission to make it part of our control . The Earth does not belong to you people . This secret underground area , belongs to every man , woman and child , in the Kilaak race . And if you fools intrude on us anymore , you 'll die . What ? Let 's go . - Right . Meanwhile , a new control center has been built on Ogasawara Island . Every effort is being used to construct a machine , that will bring the monsters under control . So , it was the moon . The waves came from there ! Now , we will stop them . We won 't land ! We 're not going to stop fighting , until we 're rid of those people . Let 's go over the plans again . Well , I 'm ready . Look at the map . - Right . You will fly , just as planned , right on target . Bringing us near the Cassini crater , in the Alpine Valley . Be sure and watch out for UFO 's . Keep flying low . Right . We will . We 'll approach from the left side . Then we 'll pass a natural basin . Then by the left slope of the Alpine Ridge . Then we 'll move north toward the swamp . Right near the crater . - Yes , sir . It looks like a UFO . And it 's coming right behind us . Do you see it ? Yes , it means trouble . What now ? Anyone want to turn back ? Let 's go on . We win the battle this time . Alright , let 's go ! Time is running out for the human race ! Stop dead ! - Stopped dead ! Ready everyone ? Here we go . Descend ! - Descend ! Stop ! - Stop ! Ground car ready ! - Ground car 's ready ! Fuel off ! - Fuel off ! Cooler ready ! - Cooler ready ! Time 's running out ! Hurry up ! Coolant pressure ? The temperature is going up ! What 's wrong ? It 's no good . At this rate , the fuel tank will explode ! What now ? Too late . To the car ! Quick ! Right ! Stop ! - Stop ! Get ready to fire ! - Get ready to fire ! Fire ! Sir . SY-3 is now in combat . Near the mouth of Cassini . All right , let 's get in touch with the moon . I hope their winning . We can 't tell what happened yet ! We 'll send a report as soon as we know . This is the moon base , go ahead . That 's enough . Huh ... If they fail , then we 'll be attacked . All of this base , will be completely destroyed . Stay alert for anything . - Right . Let 's go . Now , you three , come on . Follow me . The others wait . Wow . Look . Now , you two , check out that equipment . Destroy all of the important parts . - Right . I had no idea , we had done this much damage . Even these kind of people have their weak points . Look ! Ohh , there too ! They 're from Kilaak . Seems they can only exist on a hot planet . We broke down their wall , then the temperature went down . They 're dead ? Well , I don 't know . Captain ! Captain ! Check them out . - Right . What is this thing ? I don 't know . Now , we 'll remove it . Take it to Earth . - Right . Moon base . Moon base ! No answer ? No , there 's none at all . No answer , and no waves . Is it a failure then ? Um .. do we all agree ? No good . Now . We 'll have to burn it loose ! - Right . What happened ? Bring the tools . - Right . Now . Open it . - Right . Power ! Okay . Let 's go ! Given how long it 's been since that irregularity was observed on the moon , I think our only choice is to assume they failed . Now , switch in ! What 's wrong ? Circuit . The circuit 's burning ! I don 't care ! Push the switch in again ! The voltage is too high ! Hurry up and do it ! Do you hear me ! - Right . They did it ! The waves are gone . Now ! Hurry ! We 'll control the monsters from here . - Right . Hurry ! The Kilaaks on Earth know what we have done ! They 're still alive ? Yes , they are alive . But , it 'll take a temperature of several thousand degrees to awaken them . They 're living metal , right ? That 's right . This explains why they like the volcanic region of Mt . Fuji . Their scientific level is far higher than ours , but the number is very small . It must have taken the Kilaaks thousands of years to get to this stage . That long ? That 's amazing ! It is ... under very high temperatures these people might be able to live forever . Live forever ? That 's right . But they are helpless , in low temperatures . That settles are means of attack . Do you agree with me doctor ? - I do . Make the plans . - Right . - Oh , no ! - Godzilla again ! Hello ! Doctor . That 's where you are ? Yes . How are you ? I 'd like to thank you now . Doctor , don 't thank me now , because Godzilla 's here ! What ? Is that true ? - Yes . Godzilla 's in Tokyo ? - Yes . Now I see . We just finished our new machine and we 're trying it out . What ? Is he close by ? But , Doctor ... The monsters will listen . Things are normal . We 've just worked out a new plan . Wait and see what happens now ! Today , the Fuji area will experience something different . In deep silent , the forest seems to be waiting for the monsters charge on the Kilaaks base of operations here . And the defense force is in position . However , no monsters are in sight . And now the question is , who will be first ? Godzilla , Rodan , or Anguirus ? Here they come . And they 're ... ah ... to the right and down a little bit . Just beyond those woods over there ! It 's Godzilla ! No it 's not . The first ... It 's the son of Godzilla . And after him , I see Godzilla himself ! And next , is Mothra . Both Godzilla and Mothra are in the same area . Now we can see Anguirus . Anguirus is approaching from the left . Coming next ... are Manda , Baragon , and Gorosaurus . And Spiga 's here . They 're all coming to the base of Mt . Fuji to attack the people of Killaak . Now , Rodan 's here . We can see him in the background . He 's now heading toward Mothra and Godzilla . We think Godzilla will probably be the first to attack . He seems to be quite ready for it . The Kilaaks have shown no reaction to what 's going on here today . Godzilla will lead these monsters in mortal combat . And I 'm sure they will win . Sir , I 've just discovered a UFO . What 's that ? Ghidorah . He 's not from the Earth . They called him . His control section is down . What now ? Godzilla and the others will unite their strength . Try it now . - Right . What 's happening ? - Ghidorah ! Ghidorah , is a space monster . The monsters there cannot win . I will get in touch with you when you feel like giving up . Why that ... It 's Ghidorah . He 's a horrible space monster ! He 's going to attack them from the sky ! The monsters are waiting . Oh .. Ghidorah is starting his attack ! This is horrible ! Listen to the monsters and their horrible cries of death ! A burning monster is on his way . A burning monster ? I 've never heard of him ! From space ! And it 's alive ! Doctor ! It 's coming closer to us ! Quick ! Hide ! The Kilaaks are signaling us . The rest of your team has been destroyed by the Fire Dragon . If you don 't give up , things will get alot worse for you . What now ? Do we attack ? The great Fire Dragon will burn all of Tokyo within a few hours . Godzilla ! At last . He 's found the underground base of the Kilaacks people . They 're going to attack them . The monsters will fight , even if there is no machines . They know their enemies by natural instinct . Now the Kilaaks must pay ! Look out ! Go back ! We 're saved . We 're not safe yet . The Fire Dragon will be back soon . Alright . I 'll shoot him out of the sky ! Katsuo ! The Dragon 's ahead of us , to the left ! Alright , get the cooling missile ready ! Fire ! No good ! The gear doesn 't working ! What 's that ? A misfire ! Now ! Shoot it down ! - Right ! Let it pass and then pursue it ! You got me ? - Right ! Get ready ! Fire ! Now we 'll finish it ! Whoo ! What 's that thing ... ? I see ! The Dragon was really a saucer ! We aren 't being jammed anymore . What now ? Captain ? Alright . Fire ! We did it ! Ah ! Ha ! Ha ! The End

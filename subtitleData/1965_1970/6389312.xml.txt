 Subtitles by Caradecuica LATITUDE ZERO Longitude , one hundred eighty degrees . Latitude ZERO ! The spring of 1969 . The largest oceanographic ship in the world , the Japanese research vessel " Fuji " has sailed eastward from the Gilbert Islands to an area in the equatorial South Pacific to investigate and analyze what is known as the Cromwell Current , a subsurface stream flowing east from New Guinea to the coast of Ecuador . Why do they study it ? Because possibly it can be used by submarines to increase speed just as the jet stream is used by high-flying aircraft . Shall we go ? Dr. Ken Tashiro , physicist and oceanographer is in command . Aiding him is Dr. Jules Masson . A French geologist and veteran of many bathysphere expeditions . Perry Lawton from Trans Globe News ... His story and photographs are to be " pooled " , that is made available to all the various news services . Oh ! I wasn 't going to light up in here . I just carry it to ease my mind . This is control . How do you read us ? Loud and clear . Just passing twenty fathoms . How 's the temperature ? Exterior water temp two-zero degrees centigrade . Bathysphere temp two-six . It better get cooler . We not gonna light each other ... Has the depth of mission being determinate ? Negative ! The DSL is very dense in this area . The SONAR findings are inconclusive . But you probably reached the bottom of the current , around 100 fathoms . We 'll be pulling you up in twelve hours . Have a good trip . Out . What is the DSL ? DSL stands for deep scattering layer . Is composed of living organisms , that scatters or reverts sound pulses . Organisms that reflect sound ... That 's why . Can it be photographed ? They never have never been , at least conclusively . Might be a manu fish , even a squid . We just don 't know . Oh , that 's why . Yes , I can see those red lines right now . Divers in Cromwell Current find sound reflective squids . Gentlemen , that for sure is not gonna get me any surprise . Red lights increase vision as we get deeper . How deeper are we now ? Nearing 300 feet , close to 90 meters . Check this ! How come they 're all going one way ? What 'd you make of it ? Do they know something that we don 't ? Turn on the searchlights . Exterior water temp is one-five ... That 's normal for this depth . Dr. Tashiro , do you read us ? Go ahead ! Ship board seismograph indicate some sort of disturbance on the sea floor . Have you observed anything unusual ? Everything seems normal . Except , all marine live has disappeared . Stand by . The director is dropping the mission . We 'll start pulling you up to the surface immediately . Out ! Hey ! What 's that coming at us ? Wherever we are ... I 'm sure we 're all better than we were . Hey , we don 't have any scars either . Look , they are all healed . Glad to see you two are feeling better . I 'm Dr. Anne Barton . Dr. Tashiro ... I 'm Perry Lawton . And your companion ... what 's his name ? Jules ... Dr. Jules Masson . He 's okay ? We 're taking care of him . He 's in a separate cabin . When you feel up to getting dressed , the Control Room 's straight ahead . Oh , I don 't know whose camera it is , but I put it there . Doctor of medicine ? Harry . Yes . Hi . Oh , nice to see you up and about . You must be Dr. Tashiro ... Yes . I 'm Captain Craig McKenzie . Welcome aboard the Alpha . This is my assistant , Kobo . Mr. Lawton ... Trans Globe ... Ah yes , all the news from pole to pole . We do try . How is Dr. Masson , sir ? Dr. Barton reported he is suffering from shock and a cranial injury . Is it bad ? Everything is being done to effect his recovery as soon as possible . This Dr. Barton is kind of young , isn 't she ? She doesn 't look much like a doctor . Mr. Lawton , what 's a doctor supposed to look like ? Well ... Now , there ... what is that ? That is the volcano that tore you loose from your mooring . Now you 're seeing it from a viewing scanner we have on the surface . How close is it ? About ten miles away . Our vulcanologists have been predicting this eruption about a month . That 's why we happening to be in this area . To observe it . And that 's why we happened to observe your difficulty . Had you been dropped two miles farther south , you 'd have been incinerated . That 's a pleasant thought . Where are we ? What is this anyway ? This is the Alpha , a submersible . An American nuclear sub ? Or Japanese ? No . Mr. Lawton , neither are we American , Russian , British nor any other nationality . We are neutral . You 're neutral ? Look , a submarine like this has got to come from somewhere . Now where ? - That 's irrelevant . - No , I don 't think it is . Listen , I 'm a reporter . I do know a story when I see one . I imagine you do , but you can 't cable your editors from here . Perry ! The Alpha , launched June 21 , 1805 ... Stornaway Harbor , Hebrides ... that 's in Scotland , isn 't it ? 1805 ! That would make this submarine a hundred sixty-four years old ! You don 't believe that , do you ? Neither do I. Excuse me , Captain McKenzie . Yes ? This business about your submarine being launched in 1805 ... That 's a hoax , isn 't it ? What ? I mean ... a joke . No . But the first success submarine wasn 't build until the 1880 's . Not quite accurate , doctor . A Dutchman named Van Drebbel while in the services of King James of England build the submersible that was powered by 12 rowers . And they rowed at the Thames of the depth of nearly 15 feet . Yes ... 1620 . Captain , he 's not responding . I am afraid , we can 't treat him successfully aboard the Alpha . You realize the importance of our presence here . - How urgent is this problem ? - Very urgent . The shock factor is manageable , but he suffered some internal injuries requiring care we 're not equipped to give . Then you recommend we call off this mission ? If he 's to live . What are you gonna do now , Captain ? Toss a coin ? - Kobo , set course to El-zee . - Yes , Captain . Hello , El-zee , this is the Alpha . Go ahead , Captain McKenzie . We are aborting the mission . Alert Rehabilitation Clinic to pick up injured man as soon as we dock . That is all . Kobo ... Flank speed . Yes , Captain . All right Doctor ? Thank you . How fast are we going , anyhow ? A shade under eighty knots . Now , if you 'll excuse me ... Dock at Latitude Zero ? That 's only a place on maps , where the Equator and international Date Line cross . But , there 's no land there . Malic ! Malic ! Come quickly ! Have our agents finally kidnapped Dr. Okada ? No word from them , but look ! McKenzie is leaving the volcano . Kroiga , this is Malic . I am here , my lord Malic . The Alpha is northeast of you , on course for Latitude Zero . It would please me if you intercepted and destroyed it . Your wish is my command , my lord . We 're near enough to get McKenzie this time . You should reach the Alpha within the quarter hour . Do your best , little one . McKenzie will be destroyed . This I promise , my lord . And your reward shall be waiting , little one . Your jealousy is showing . I can 't help it . I just hate that woman . Don 't be silly . She 's useful to us . You 're the only woman I keep with me . Why don 't you tell me you gonna get rid of her , and let Ching take over the Black Shark ? I will , eventually ... after she destroys the Alpha and McKenzie . Later , Lucretia , when we have something to really celebrate . The Black Shark . Is it going to attack ? It always has . Cover the the lights . Yes . Do you have anything to fight it with ? Nothing is powerful as what it has . That includes speed ! It 's a matter of how to escape . Go up twenty meters . Maybe that avalanche caught them . Stay above two strokes . Prepare search missiles ! Search missiles ready ! Those aren 't torpedoes ! Search missiles . Follow our heat path . Kobo , activate the icing equipment . Yes , Captain . It doesn 't work , Captain . Do something ! Will you ! McKenzie has increased the mobility of the Alpha . He 's forever changing something on that damned boat ! Your " little one " is no match for him . Don 't underestimate her just because you dislike her . She was stupid ! If those missiles had backfired , she could have cost us the Black Shark . Trying to get close up to use their laser cannon , I would guess . Another sub ! No . That 's a ghost image of us . Marvelous ! How ingenious ! It must be a projection device of some kind . Of course ! But which is the real Alpha and which is the image ? How bloody inventive that McKenzie is ! I have done it ! I have finally done it ! Did she do it ? That 's what McKenzie would like us to believe . Look ! He has made a fool of her . She shouldn 't have fired those missiles so soon ! How did you do that ? Well , not exactly with mirrors , Dr. Tashiro . Top speed ! Ram it ! What 's that glow ? That 's the light of our artificial sun . Sun ? Under the sea ? Kobo , turn on the equalizers . Yes , Captain . Faster ! Faster ! I 'm sure Kroiga did her best . She shouldn 't have failed ... Order the Black Shark back to Blood Rock . Then contact our agents in Japan and find out about kidnapping Dr. Okada . I better get back to my patient . What happened to the Black Shark ? The electronic shield of light prevents entry into Latitude Zero to all vehicles except the Alpha and a few others that have equalizing equipment . It 's a sort of electronic fence around your ranch , right ? In a sense , yes . - Kobo , take over , please . - Yes , Captain . Who does the Black Shark belong to ? To an evil genius named Malic , and his companion Lucretia . His captain is Kroiga , a woman . Formidable opponent . More skillful than most seamen . Where 's this Black Shark from ? Malic 's base at Blood Rock . It 's an island some distance north of here . And you 're always at war with each other ? He lives up to his name . In one archaic language " Malic " means murderer . If it wasn 't for the efforts of Latitude Zero , he might have taken over your world a century ago . A century ago ? Yes , we were students , not friends , really . We aren 't enemies neither . He chose one path ... I another . Wait , just a minute . You and he were students together a century ago , right ? Yes . What ? Just how old are you ? Well ... Since you question everything , I don 't expect you to believe this or much of anything else you 're about to see . I am two hundred and four years old . Malic is now two hundred and three . And this Dr. Barton ... How old does that make her ? Mr. Lawton . Even in Latitude Zero , gentlemen do not discuss the age of a lady . We 'll be docking soon . This Sir ... we are actually at the bottom of the sea ? Yes , a little more than eleven thousand fathoms . Is taking pictures here forbidden ? Not at all . Oh good , because nobody 's gonna believe me unless I show them pictures . They might not even believe me anyway . Gently , Kobo . Yes . - Is he all right ? - He will be better soon . I 'll go with him to the Rehabilitation Clinic . Is that electrically operated ? Yes . We have no internal combustion machines here . So no smog . Kobo . Yes . report the malfunction of the icing equipment and have and have the R and D people make the modifications on the bow rudders as I requested . Yes , Captain . Now ... to the Great Hall . This is a model of Latitude Zero . Here 's the Great Hall where we are now . Fabulous . Who does it all belong to ? To the people who live here . That lady over there looks like she just got here by a wagon train . Some of our people prefer the styles they wore when they arrived . But who runs it ? Nothing like this can operate all by itself ! Mr. Lawton , are you skeptical by nature or because of your profession ? I 'm a realist . We are the realists . That 's why we 're not political here . Politics are only needed by people incapable of running their own lives . I 'm sorry . Quite all right . Welcome home , Craig ! How was the volcano ? Erupting ! Professor Bella , a nuclear physicist . He 's made many contributions to our sunshine . Now we can get much more Vitamin D. Comes up six o 'clock in the morning and dims down at eight at night . Please , change my name to Alice . I didn 't take a ride in a bathysphere . I just fell through the looking glass . Mr. Lawton , you can be very good company when you aren 't glowering . Thank you . Dr. Karnack ! Don 't you look fine today . Dr. Karnack ? Karnack ? The Russian mathematician ? Yes . He was reported killed in an air crash five or six years ago ! Ah , and that water fall in those mountains . Yes ! That 's the source of our fresh water river . They evaporate it in the hills , over there . Dr. Tashiro seemed to understand what I tried to explain about Latitude Zero . But Perry Lawton found it difficult to accept . But he appreciated that the variety of architectural styles in our residential areas representing international tastes and reflected the desire to preserve what was good from the past . I 'm sorry . A place like this just cannot run itself . Maybe you 'll never understand . But when ... greed is made meaningless , there is no reason for one to seek power over his neighbors or become a .. as you , buddy , a though dog . Are you trying to tell us that nobody down here ever raises his voice or has an argument ? Of course we all do , but arguments are to solve problems , not bolster egos . You really go for this , don 't you ? - Yes , I do . - All right . Does everybody down here wear gold clothing ? We use a good deal of it . You mean there are gold mines here ? No . We extract it from sea water . It 's inexpensive and very practical . No laundry , you know ... Captain McKenzie , where exactly is Jules Masson now ? He is right here in the rehabilitation clinic . Everything is near normal . You see , the cranial bruise has already healed . The lung puncture has closed . The broken ribs have knitted quickly . The new narrow injections promote healing in a miraculously short time . Really nothing to be concerned about . All he now requires is ample sleep . When can he be released , Dr. Sugata ? In the morning . Goodnight , Dr. Barton . 'Night , Dr. Sugata . Come in , gentlemen . Excuse me . Here 's the bathroom . Tomorrow morning this closet will be full of fresh clothing . The YMCA was never like this . Here 's the bed . Captain McKenzie ! Is this what I think it is ? A diamond . Is it real ? Everything in Latitude Zero is real . Do you mind if I take a few of those stones , Captain ? Take all you like . We only use them for abrasive or cutting tools . That 's their only real value to us . Why are you sweating ? Because I never was an instant millionaire before ! That 's why ! Thank you very much , Captain McKenzie ! Don 't mention it . For dinner , do we got a mess hall or what ? Oh ! The schedule is here . You press these buttons to select what you want from the menu , and it will be delivered through there from the central kitchen . What is this : caviar , rack of lamb , prime rib ... Well , and who you get to prepare this food ? Oh , this is a hobby . Today the chef is Dr. Ildoro , mineralogist . Don 't worry . You won 't find any stones in your stomach . Goodnight , gentlemen . I 'll see you in my office tomorrow . You can 't have everything . No moon , no stars . Do you realize that those people McKenzie talked to , or about , all disappeared or they were reported missing and finally presumed to be dead . Maybe we 're in Paradise and don 't even know it . Oh , come on now ! I 'm serious ! You think maybe we 're dead . I don 't know . I 've never been dead before . You know what , McKenzie and some of his cronies they could 've kidnapped those people they could 've brought them down here . and then brainwashed them into working for him . You 're out of your head . And now he 's trying to brainwash us ! You act like he 's already gotten to you ! He sure has . Or maybe while we were still out , we were given some sort of injections that might have caused hallucinations ! Oh , come on ! No , I mean it . When we come to , we might find we 're just ... another exhibit in Marineland . You gonna join me ? Or should I enjoy all this hallucination all by myself . I 'll be dead . To Latitude Zero . What 's McKenzie up to now ? He 's doing something to the Alpha . Every change he makes in it also makes him more difficult to destroy . If only there was some way to puncture that dome ... You know there 's no way of doing that ! We must get him away from there . In the open we never gonna get him . This is Malic ... From Tokyo ? Go ahead . Dr. Okada has escaped ? Escaped ? I 'm not interested in how or why you failed to kidnap him in Tokyo . When did he sail ? What route ? Report to our agent in Osaka and wait for further orders . Dr. Okada and his daughter sailed from Yokohama last night . The ship is bound for Honolulu , then San Francisco . Are Latitude Zero agents with him ? I don 't know . But , we 've got to get Okada here . Killing two birds with one stone ... I 'll get the secret of his immunized radiation formula and also use him as bait ! Don 't you see ? I 'll make sure McKenzie finds out Okada is here on Blood Rock . When he comes to rescue him , it 'll be the end of McKenzie ! Yes . But you are inviting him to invade us . That 's the idea , Lucretia . Now contact Kroiga for me . She has one more mission to perform before I " retire " her from service . I 'm very grateful to you for saving my life , Captain McKenzie . Not at all , Dr. Masson . She talked me into it ... - Good morning . - Good morning . Hey you are fine ! Why shouldn 't I ? Look who 's been taking care of me . Well , they sure got you up and around fast , didn 't they ? From I 've seen so far , I hasn 't even in a mild medical problem . Oh I see ... Hey ! Quite layout ? , isn 't he ? Yes , great . What 's this thing ? This is a model of a special vehicle ... Used for transporting Project Teams to and from Latitude Zero . From where ? All over the world . For instance , Project Team Three . The chemist is Sir Morris Polley . But , he defected to the Communists ! So the Western Press reported . The Communists said nothing preferring let the West believe he indeed had defected to them . The truth is one of those brought here is working on pure science instead of " profitable " science . What if he decides he 'd rather go back to London ? Oh , we will take him home . That young man is from Project Team Eight . The man with him is Sergey Kievsky , the biologist . I thought he took political asylum in Canada . So you read ... The Communists read he had taken his family on a holiday to Egypt . Actually , he is here . Here is Dr. Okada . Three years ago when he received the Nobel Prize . Every nation in the world tried to lure him into working for them or steal his discovery . Including Malic . These men are from Project Team Fourteen when they explained Latitude Zero to Dr. Okada and his daughter . That was last month . And where are they now ? Are on their way to Hawaii . To meet the Team to bring them here . Father ! The ship will radio for help . Aid may come before Kroiga can get Dr. Okada and his daughter aboard the Black Shark . That 's so none will risk firing for fear of injuring our noted guest . Besides , I think we can count on the little one . Captain , what 's this Okada done that 's so important ? He developed a serum that can immunize against radiation . No wonder every nation wants it . Exactly . Any one government could immunize its own population and destroy all opposition . But Dr. Okada has refused to reveal his formula until all mankind posses it . But ... after these people here in Latitude Zero invent something or whatever how is it going to benefit mankind if you keep everything down here ? We frequently manage to ... find new discoveries into medical laboratories of the world . The passenger liner en route from Japan to Honolulu was stopped on the high seas by a mysterious submarine , identity not established . And the Nobel Prize-winning bacteriologist , Dr. Shogoro Okada and his daughter , Tsuruko , were forcibly taken from the ship by hostile persons unknown . ... the kidnapping of the famous scientist is intolerable ! At this very moment , our Ambassador to the United Nations is protesting to the Secretary General about the high-handed act of piracy . The identity of the submarine has not yet been confirmed . But since it was not American the evidence indicated it may have been either of Soviet design or a new aggressive step by Red China . Strong diplomatic protests ... Any report from Project Team H ? Team H from Hawaii . Standby . This is Yankton . We are waiting to meet Okada and his daughter in Honolulu and bring them to El-Zee , after supplying identical substitutes to continue the voyage to San Francisco to cover his disappearance We 're now waiting for instructions . None now . Stay put . No ! I will tell you nothing ! Dr. Okada , you judge us wrongly . We new you were going to be taken for that ship in Honolulu and spirited away to Latitude Zero never to be heard from again . We are going willingly to that place . I see . Well , if that 's your desire , I 'll see to it that you get there as soon as you give me the formula for the immunization serum . Never . Well , you 're probably too upset to think clearly right now . Take a little rest , and then we 'll talk again . That way , Doctor and Tsuruko-san . Do I get a reward for having brought them to you ? Of course , little one . Just what did you have in mind ? To be alone with you . It 's a long time . Too long . Come with me . I 'll take you where we can be together . Kroiga ... Wait in here , little one . Oh , no ! Malic ... Damn you ! What 's that noise ? What happened to her ? Nothing ... yet . This way , please . Please , this is our guest room . You can rest here , Doctor , and think about my proposition . I will not cooperate with you at any time . You may change your mind . This is one of my creations . They will keep you company for the next twelve hours . Convince your father to cooperate , or I 'll turn you into a creature like that . No , no ... You 're a monster ! No , I am a genius . If you continue to be obstinate , Dr. Okada you will force me to get your formula in my own way by surgically removing your brain , and then dissecting its memory bank . That 's impossible ! Not for me . You have twelve hours . Now to let McKenzie know that I have Dr. Okada ... It 's originating from someone here ! Yes , it 's Okada . How convenient that they supplied him with a homing device . Very good . It saves me the trouble of telling McKenzie where Okada is . - That will bring him here . - Exactly what I want . We 're getting a signal on 87.4 . We 'll have its location in a moment . McKenzie . - Yes , sir . Have the modifications on the Alpha I requested been completed ? The work is done , but testing will require at least another day . No time for testing . She must be ready within one hour . Thank you . The signal is stabilized , therefore Okada can not be on the Black Shark . They have to be on Blood Rock . No land or island shows at that point . Plenty of islands have never input on maps . How can Okada let you know where he is ? We gave him a homing device before he left Tokyo . Gentlemen , I had planned to return you to the surface today , but it 'll have to wait . Anne , we must select three men to go with us on this rescue attempt . What 's the matter with us ? We 're only alive because you put us safe without the bathysphere Let us go with you . I wouldn 't miss it . I must warn you the dangers will be very great . So , how do we start preparing for them ? You may need a doctor , Captain ? All right , but you 'll remain aboard the Alpha . First , to the Bath of immunity . The bath of what ? Now , you see , Gentlemen , that 's how it 's done . The immunity only lasts for twenty-four hours . Submerge for a count of three . Uh , ladies first . I think you 'd better go first . You know , I thought we would look like Easter Eggs . - You 'd better be tested too . - No ... Ah , me ? I 've been hit harder with ping pong balls . These are made of Corvexo ... an alloy of gold and platinum . Impervious to all temperatures . And this is an added precaution , put them on . Then , we 'll board the Alpha . - Mr . Lawton . - Thank you . Have you changed your mind , Dr. Okada ? Never ! Do you expect to be rescued ? The people of Latitude Zero already know where we are . I certainly hope so . They 've had ample time to pinpoint your location . That 's why I didn 't take that homing device away from you when you first time turn on . Ingenious . Much less obvious than others . But they 've served their purpose . Bring them to the operating room . El-zee , El-zee , this is the Alpha . This is El-zee . Are you still hearing the homing device ? Negative , it stopped , twelve seconds ago . No ... no ... no ... please ... no ... No .. no ... Malic please ... no ! Please , no , Malic ... No , no , please ... Malic ! No ! You 're a monster ... a fiend ... damn you ! I hope you die ... die ... die ... While we 're waiting for the arrival of your benefactor , I 'll demonstrate my skill . by creating the creature that will kill Captain McKenzie for me . Nearly an anesthetic . He is to watch everything . Is that way in all sides ? Yes . And how we get up those cliffs ? Anne , cover for Kobo . The rest of your equipment . This is the Helium Elevation Belt . Rocket-powered , it permits a person to climb to high altitudes very quickly . That 's the answer of my question , right ? Here is the safety . Here 's the trigger . Now these are dangerous and diverse weapons . In the fingers . The first finger emits a jet of fire . - A miniature flame-thrower ? - Yes . The second a paralyzing gas that immobilizes but does not kill . How do we keep from immobilizes ourselves with it ? The Bath of Immunity and Corvexo suit will prevent that . The third discharges a laser beam that is lethal up to one hundred yards . Each is fired ... by its own switch on the wrist . Under no circumstances ... are you to use any of these weapons , unless I specifically give you the order . I can 't stand it ! No ! Can you see ? The brain of this lion . Your doctors are so elated that they have finally been able to transplant organs from one human to another . That 's child 's play . I 'm now going to transplant a human brain into the head of this lion . My God , no ! Don 't kill that woman ! Think of it , Dr. Okada , a human 's brain in a savage beast ! It will be able to understand and obey my orders . Ah , what a marvelous creature this is going to be ! I beg you . Don 't do this terrible thing ! I 'll give you the formula . Only stop this , and let her go ! It 's too late , Doctor . There is a ledge below at eighty feet . After we leave , submerge and let the Alpha settle on it . The Alpha has surfaced beside the cliff wall . Administer the anesthetic to the condor . You are to remain on that ledge until you receive a radio signal from me to surface . If you fail to receive that signal by dusk you are to return to Latitude Zero immediately . Is that understood ? Immediately . Yes , Captain . Be careful . Yeah . I must be crazy ! Changed your mind ? Don 't want to come alone ? No , is not that . I didn 't bring my camera with me . I didn 't bring one lousy camera . Malic , look ! McKenzie has arrived ! Now watch and see what happens to him and his little group . I 've seen pictures of the moon that looks a lot more inviting . Captain , you 've never been here before ? First time . That 's great . How do we find Dr. Okada ? We have to search . Could be in that tower . It looks like a way down . What 's the matter ? It 's a strong magnetic force . Lock on the lever on our elevation belts ! Captain ! Kobo , try to pull us out . One at a time . They 're getting loose ! Malic . They freed themselves . Don 't matter . Don 't bother me . Kroiga , do you hear me ? You see , Dr. Okada ! My new creation even knows its name ! This amplification serum . It will increase the size of this creature at least three times . All within a few minutes . Kroiga ! Come here ! It can 't be ... a beast with the brain of a human ! Go ! Find McKenzie and kill him ! Yes ! Kill McKenzie ! You understand ? Kill McKenzie ! Now Dr. Okada , it is your turn . No , no ! Silence her ! Hurry ! Doctor , doctor ! This way ! Are you all right ? You look all right , OK ? I guess so . Back to that tunnel we just pass ! We head to that high ground . Rather a better attack , I should have only a few bones to pick on . Watch out ! There ! Maybe we can wade across . I 'll go . Let 's get his boots off , Ken . Captain McKenzie ! Over here ! Can you make it ? I 'm okay . Jules , get back here . Grab him . . Two on each side . Activate your elevation belts ! Kroiga ! Kroiga ! Kroiga was a fool as a woman . Is she also a fool as a griffin ! Why doesn 't she attack ? But you will not scape , Dr. Okada ! Please , please don 't hurt my father ! Malic ! Idiot ! Why didn 't she get McKenzie ? - Kobo ! Yes . Try that lock . - Yes , Captain . Give me the anesthetic . McKenzie ! Lucretia ! Lucretia ... I ... . I didn 't ... . I didn 't mean . I know Malic . Malic ... Kill him ! Ah ! Malic ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Father ! Tsuruko ! Father ! - Captain McKenzie ? - We 'll talk later , Dr. Okada . Malic has escaped . We must hurry back to the Alpha . Captain ! Dr. Okada , Tsuruko . This is Dr. Anne Barton . She will take care of you . Where 's Jules ... Dr. Masson ? He 's up there with Kobo and Mr. Lawton . We have to go back to help them down . Are they all right ? Everybody is all right , except Malic escaped us . Ready ! Yes . Is that what I think it is ? The Black Shark ! Let 's go ! Inside , everybody ! Hurry ! Try to overcome this force , my friend ! We are being pulled by a strong magnetic force . We 're in a magnetic field coming from that cliff ! - Prepare the laser gun . - Yes , sir . I 'm going to destroy the Alpha and everyone on her , piece by piece ! That laser cannon is aimed on us . - Hold to something stead , all of you . - What 's going to happen ? The first time , test of the modification installed just before we left . Kobo . Activate bow rudders . Yes , captain . If this works , we 're going to fly . Fly ? Now or never . Aim the laser gun ! Laser Ready ! Fire ! Fire ! Shoot it down ! Shoot it down ! Get out ! Out of my way ! Sir ! We are being pulled to land ! How ironic . Black Shark has been caught in the magnetic field ! Sir , look out ! Scratch one submarine ! Scratch one island ! I know . I 've already told them goodbye and I wished them luck , which I figure they 've already found . A logical conclusion for a good reporter . Have a chair . I suppose you 're anxious to get back to your own world . Well , with the terrific story I 've got , plus the pictures to prove it and a tobacco pouch full of diamonds , it 's the only place to go . Uh , Captain McKenzie ... You said everything down here was developed for the benefit of mankind , right ? When are you going to let the rest of the world in on this secret ? Mr. Lawton , none of us is wise enough to know when men will live in harmony . We do believe that eventually , must until then ... we must continue our work here , because is the only place on this planet where we can . Kobo , arrange to return Mr. Lawton to the surface . Yes , Captain . Good luck . Thank you . Captain , excuse me . How much longer before the spacecraft splashes down , Captain ? The American officers aboard tell us that re-entry should begin at eleven hundred hours . Raft adrift off starboard bow , sir ! Oh , over there ! Look , I 've told you all a dozen times . The other two decide to remain down there . This captain ... - At the bottom of the ocean ? It 's the truth , I swear ! And all those scientists the world think are dead are really alive . They are working down there . I saw them ! What is this ? He seems to think I 'm somebody called Tashiro . If you please , Gentlemen ... I 'll be in the radio room with Lt. Hastings . Thank you . What are you doing here ? I 'm temporarily assigned to this ship to observe the pick-up of a space-craft , Commander Glenn McKenzie . You look exactly like Captain Craig McKenzie . Now , you can see for yourself the pictures I took ! - Nothing on this film . - What ? Blank ! What ? That 's his lousy darkroom that ruined my films . I took pictures of everything there . Wait a minute ! I can prove it to you . You see this ... It was full of diamonds . Captain McKenzie gave them to me . I come from a long line of McKenzie 's . I never knew any rich enough to give away diamonds . Lt. Hastings , you better bring a corpsman to the wardroom . Right , sir . Thank you . Until this mission is completed , you will be cared for in sick bay . But I 'm not sick ! You are all so hung up on exploring space . You 're not even interested in learning about a miracle that exists right here on our own planet . When this miracle you seen so hang upon can be true we 'll be most interested , Mr. Lawton .

 - Mr. Hamilton ? - Yes ? Scarsdale is next . Good day ? - You ? - Very productive . Got the roses out in back all trimmed . Oh , letter this morning from Sally . Sam 's finished internship . Starts practice next week . Well , he should specialize . That 's the only thing now . Well , maybe he just wants to get the feel of things . Our little girl 's done all right . Something wrong ? No . That phone call last night ? What about it ? I heard you pacing around in the study afterward ... till almost 2 : 00 . Just a crazy prank . Look , Emily , it was nothing . Art ? It 's me again . Arthur ? Arthur ! Look , I don 't know who you are , but — - Charlie Evans . - Stop saying that ! Charlie Evans is dead . Now , I want you to stop this , or I 'll be forced to call the police . Art , there are two trophies on the fireplace ... near the tennis team picture . Pick up the phone and walk over to them . Go ahead . You know the cord will reach . Are you there ? Yes . In the picture , you and I are standing with our arms ... around each other 's shoulder . We 're both wearing the same kind of wristwatch . - Remember , we gave them to each other after winning the doubles at Princeton ? - Yes . Okay . Take the doubles trophy there and turn it over . One edge of the felt is loose . Pull it back . " Fidelis eternis . " You scratched it there down in the locker room ... after we won the finals . Remember ? With your belt buckle . I — I had forgotten . I didn 't . It can 't be you . Okay , now . Listen very carefully . - Did you get the address today ? - Yes . Good . You 're to use the name " Wilson . " You — you can 't be Charlie . You just don 't come back . I 'm alive ! More alive than I 've been in the past 25 years . You 've got to come tomorrow . Arthur , listen . If you don 't show up , that 's it . Think , for pete 's sake ! What have you got now ? What ? I don 't know . Tomorrow , just past noon . Remember : Use the name " Wilson . " I ... don 't know . I won 't call again , buddy . Charlie ? Charlie ? - Was it that call again ? - No . Stop cross-examining me every time the phone rings . Understand ? Perfectly . I 'm , uh , sorry . Excuse me . You 're excused . Any fever ? No , just old faithful . Make an appointment to see Dr. Hogan tomorrow , hmm ? I will . Promise ? Promise . Thank you . Therefore ... in view of the differential ... between your present equity — between your present equity and the amount necessary ... for ... capitalization ... we cannot extend the loan you require . Should your equity — Where ? - " Should your equity — " - Oh , yeah . Should your equity increase , do not hesitate to call on us ... for a personal reappraisal , et cetera , et cetera . Standard closing . Yes , sir . My name is , uh , Wilson . I was told to — I was told to come here . Look , is this the place or isn 't it ? They aren 't here anymore . I got it wrote down . Thank you . Move it ! Let 's go , let 's go ! Move it down the line ! Let 's go , you bunch of idiots ! Get that beef cut down ! Let 's go ! Move it up ! Damn you guys ! Let 's get that truck going and get the meat the hell outta here ! Go on ! What are you gonna do ? Take all day ? Come on , move ! Don 't let those hooks fall off . Come on , let 's move it ! Okay , Toddy . Give us another truck up here . Tighten up with it , now . Ah , Mr. Wilson . - Let 's go . On the truck with them . - Surely this isn 't the — - No , sir . Please come with me . - Let 's go , Frank ! Move that truck off . Come on , now . Let 's hook it off . Hook on . Move that beef off the line ! Let 's go ! This is costing money , you bunch of jerks ! Come on ! Go ! Go ! Come on , cut it down . Cut it ! Cut it ! All right , come on ! Move out ! Keep hooking that beef up . Cut it down . Let 's go . Would you step in , please , sir ? I 'd much prefer to ride in front , if you don 't mind . I 'm sorry , sir , but customers are asked to ride in the back . Your hat , sir . It 's only a short ride . Thank you . We 're here , sir . Would you take the elevator to your left , sir ? Ah , Mr. Wilson . Will you come this way , please ? Yes . I 'm very sorry . There 'll be a short delay . - Perhaps you 'd like tea and a sandwich . - Thank you . All right . Make yourself comfortable . Here we go . Uh , pardon me ... but could you tell me the way out of this building ? Excuse me . I was wondering if you could tell — Excuse me . I 'm trying to find — Excuse me . I 'm trying to find my way out of the building . I have a gentleman here who wishes to leave the building . Yes , that would be Mr. Wilson . Would you have him return to Mr. Ruby 's office , please ? Mr. Ruby is waiting for him there . They want you down at the end of the corridor again . Yes . All right . Thank you . Ah , there you are , Mr. Wilson . Come in , please . Would you close the door ? Please , sit down . My name is Ruby . I 've been assigned to go over the circumstances of your death with you . - What ? - I know this seems rather strange to you . That 's why I 'm here . You probably have a lot of questions . Of course , the subject might appear indelicate , but most of our clients — Now , get this straight : I am not a client . Precisely , Mr. Wilson . You are not a client yet . Let me start by explaining ... the cost factor involved . To begin with ... the procedure is a rather complex one . This seems to be your supper . Oh , the chicken looks delicious . No , thank you . Yes , as I was saying , the cost runs ... in the neighborhood of $ 30,000 . I know this seems rather high , but in addition ... to the rather extensive ... cosmetic renovation by way of plastic surgery for you ... CPS has to provide a fresh corpse that perfectly matches ... your physical dimensions and medical specifications . " CPS " ? Oh , Cadaver Procurement Section . You sure you don 't want this chicken ? Absolutely sure . Oh , pity . The next step is ... the carefully planned obliteration ... of identifiable portions of the cadaver ... before it is found . Features , dental structure , fingerprints . We can 't leave anything to chance . No , I — I guess not . Uh , would you mind if — Please . Thank you . Now , there is a problem — that the circumstances of your death must be simple . Well , a simple accident , strangely enough ... is costly , Mr. Wilson . The trick lies in obliterating ... just so much and no more , so that ... an identification still can be made , based on ... as I say , general dimensions ... plus a credible sequence of events ... witnesses , et cetera . Oh , the whole thing must be very carefully staged . We guarantee a death of this kind . Mm , excuse me . Delicious ! They have a wonderful way of baking cheese on it ... so that it gets very crispy . Now , there are any number of ways ... you can be found . Excuse me . I mean your body can be found . The victim of some kind of machinery , an explosion ... um , a hunting misadventure . Oh , but I think these are somewhat too gross for you . I had thought perhaps a hotel room fire . Would you like me to outline the circumstances ? - No , thank you . - Oh , good . I was — - I was hoping you would agree — - No ! I mean , I-I can 't be sure . Oh , well , of course , of course , of course . We can 't expect you to decide all at once . Um , think it over . There 's so much else to be done , Mr. Wilson ... but if I may say so ... the question of death selection may be the most important decision in your life . Ah , here are the trust instruments . Mr. Joliffe , Mr. Brown , Mr. Wilson . My colleagues . This is your , uh , revised will ... drawn in accordance with the requirements of the trust ... all predated , of course , to save you the trouble . Oh , no , no . It 's standard procedure . effective at the time of your death ... the trust provides for ... very liberal settlements on your wife and daughter ... and more-than-sufficient funds ... for your financial needs and your new identity ... from sums assigned to us as your trustees . Insurance policies ... annuities ... real estate . If you 'll , uh , sign right here . The staging here is rather authentic , you 'll see . Of course , the drug made it easier to manipulate you ... into the proper positions and attitudes . Rest easy , Mr. Wilson . You did not ravage our girl . Of course , the photography is not too professional ... but I think it 's clear enough . - So now it 's — - I have a message from Charlie . Charlie ? He wanted me to tell you that rebirth is painful . You were going to say ... " So now it 's blackmail , " eh , Mr. Wilson ? - What would you call it ? - Just a kind of insurance . Isn 't it easier to go forward when you know you can 't go back ? But you knew that , didn 't you ? The minute you hung up with Charlie after that first call . Ah , sure you did . You 're saying ... I can never go back ? Fact is , you really don 't want to go back . Sakes , boy ! You owe yourself this thing . Rebirth . Life again . Begin again , all new , all different . The way you always wanted it . You got another chance . Heck , nobody 's gonna miss you , are they ? - My wife . - What about her ? What are you to her now ? - We get along . - What does that mean ? There 's my daughter . We don 't see much of her , actually . She lives out west with her husband . She writes now and then , uh ... to let us — What are you to her now ? Excuse an old fool prying , son ... but what does it all mean ? It can 't mean anything now , anymore . There 's nothing anymore , is there ? Anything at all ? I ... expect to be president of the bank before too long . And I have my boat in the summer . We have friends . Anything at all ? I guess I ... never thought much about it before . I leave Emily pretty much alone to do what she , uh — We get along , as I said . We hardly ever quarrel . Not that that 's any ... measure of our lives . Frankly ... during the last few years , we ... hardly ever ... ever — I — I don 't know why I 'm telling you this . 'Cause you want to . Go on . Ever ... ever ... showed much affection . But as I said — boat . And , uh — So this is what happens to the dreams of youth . Go on , son . Let it out . Nothing to be ashamed of . Let it out . It 's time for a change . Now , look . They 'll both be well taken care of . They don 't need you , and you don 't need them . You just can 't help each other anymore . Ah , look , son . You know what I 'm saying is true . There 's nothing anymore . No , no . What you need now is a good rest . Now , there a few things to be worked out in the morning ... but my boys will clear those up , and you needn 't worry none . Your boys ? You 're the head of it all ? There never was a struggle in the soul of a good man that wasn 't hard . My papa told me that ... and it 's sure enough true . Believe me , son . I know . I believe you . That 's fine . You know , Mr. Wilson , you represent something of a milestone around here . When the bandages are removed ... I think you 'll be more than pleased . In fact , I expect you to be prancing around here like a stud bull . Now , it 's gonna take a while , so , uh ... try to be patient until we get you ready for the world again . Now , don 't do that ! You can 't talk because we 've extracted all your teeth ... and given you a complete vocal cord resection . Give the tissues time to pull together . Now , you got a new set of permanent teeth . In a week you won 't know the difference . Thank you . That 's what hurts most right now . Everything 's different . When the first healing 's over , we 'll start conditioning for muscle tone . Yes , yes . Those too . Fingerprints . Mr. Wilson , even your signature . Little thing we did with the tensor ligaments of the hand . The orbicularis or is started to sag , so we tightened them with ligatures . Yeah . Then we worked on the mandible to square up the bone . Well , I never . Holy mackerel . I don 't know how you boys do it . Doc , it 's a masterpiece . Good work . Easy does it . You 'll be all right , son . Your scars and hematomas will disappear in a couple of weeks . After several months of physical conditioning ... the process will be complete . My name is Davalo . I 'm your guidance adviser . This is about your future career . I 'm afraid I haven 't thought very much about that . Oh , yes , you have , sir . - Permit me . - I want a ball ... - a big , big red one . I 'm afraid we picked this up a little too early . Sit down . We recorded these regressions ... under Pentothal and caffeine sodium benzoate . At first , there 's always a touch of the infantile ... but later on , we progress to a more mature ... expressional infrastructure . Ah , here we are . What would you like to do most of all ? Of anything in the whole world ? I 'd like to be a tennis pro , I guess . Yes . That 's what I 'd like best of all . And suppose you couldn 't be ? What else would you choose ? I guess I 'd like to paint stuff . Pictures ? Pictures and things . Well ... I think the creative wish pattern is pretty self-evident . You mean , I — I ought to be a painter ? Exactly ! You see , painting allows you a basic creative outlet ... as well as providing an environment ... in which these sublimations will have free vent . Now , let 's take a look at the program we 've worked out for you . Certificates of study . Abroad . Notices of first six one-man shows . Your pictures are realistic in treatment ... but deal with poetic imagery in choice of subject . Not that I pretend to be a critic of painting . These diplomas ... from reputable universities ... they — they can 't be forged . Mr. Wilson , I assure you ... every item is bona fide and valid . How-How could I even approach such a professional level ? I couldn 't — Oh , very simple . You are already established in a position of some dignity . Oh , nothing conspicuous . Just a solid , mildly successful sort of thing . You will be supplied with fresh paintings periodically . In time , you 'll perfect your own style . Surreal , primitive , impressionistic — whatever . It will be a transition from this present work . You see ... you don 't have to prove anything anymore . You are accepted . You will be in your own new dimension . You 're a bachelor . Birth certificate . The only son ... of deceased parents , and so forth . In short ... you are alone in the world ... absolved of all responsibility ... except to your own interest . Isn 't that marvelous ? Your studio is in Malibu , California . Quite luxurious . Very private . You 'll make your own adjustment in your own way ... in your own time . Oh , you 'll be self-conscious at first . Don 't worry . It will wear off . And remember — You 've got what almost every middle-aged man ... in America would like to have : freedom . Real freedom . Ah , it 's been a pleasure , Mr. Wilson . Pillow , Mr. Wilson ? Yes , thank you . Tony ! Tony ? Tony Wilson ! Hey there , you old rascal ! Slow down ! Where 's the fire ? Can 't wait to get back to them pretty little models , huh ? I am late . Now , if I didn 't have to catch me a plane , I 'd make you buy me a drink , by God ! See you soon . Gotta run . Welcome home , Mr. Wilson . My name is John . I 've been assigned to help you . It 's very nice . I think you 'll be quite comfortable , sir . Do you like your studio ? - Yes . - Perhaps you 'd like to freshen up and have a drink . Afterward , I 'll try to clear up any point on which you may have curiosity . The bath is through here . I 'll unpack these for you later . Fine . how long will you be here , um — John , sir . For as long as you need me . The company is fully aware that you may have problems at first ... - and will spare no effort to help you solve them . - Thank you . Yes , sir . - John ? - Yes , sir ? I , uh — I had a curious experience at the airport . What was that ? Well , I was accosted by a man who called me by name . He seemed to know me , and I 'm certain I 've never met him . I suppose it was a mistake on his part . So it would appear , sir . What kind of people live here ? Professionals . Some in business . Some write . No , uh , no artists , I hope . I think you are the only one , sir . If I may suggest , sir ... perhaps you 'd like to give a small cocktail party for the immediate neighbors . Oh , well , I , uh — I 'd better get myself used to things first . Later on , maybe . As you wish , sir . That 's very good , sir . Thank you . Wouldn 't you enjoy meeting some of the people here , sir ? I told you I 'm not ready yet , John . I 'll do this in my own way and in my own time . Of course , sir . Hello . Hey . Hey , wait . I 'm sorry about back there . How about if we try it again ? Hello . I 'm Nora Marcus . I 'm ... Tony Wilson . - Walk ? - Sure . Ocean , I love you ! You 're beautiful ! Beautiful ! All that power , and she 's got all the answers . Hey ! Got a question ! What did you ask ? Oh , a tough one : " Who and what is Tony Wilson ? " And what did it say ? It told me to mind my own business . That was my life . Two boys , ages ten and twelve . Successful and indulgent husband . A beautiful house , complete with microwave oven ... intercom , station wagon , et cetera , et cetera . Ad infinitum . Ad ... absurdum . And ? I made myself a cup of coffee , dressed , and left . - That was four years ago . - And you never went back ? I 've seen them from time to time , but ... it 's different now . Maybe because I 'm different . I don 't expect you to understand . I think I do . You ? An artist ? Why should you understand ? You spent your whole life being . You don 't know anything about me , really . Oh , yes , I do . It 's all right there in your face . What is ? - Now you 're fishing . - No . Seriously . This may hurt a little . I agreed to take my chances . Okay . Madam Marcus will read the leaves . What kind of a man is he ? There 's grace in the line and color , but ... it doesn 't emerge pure . It pushes at the edge of something still ... tentative ... unresolved , as if ... somewhere in the man ... there is still a key unturned . That 's quite an analysis . Not really . When you come to think of it , it sort of fits everybody , doesn 't it ? It 's very nice here . The good things always happen with the rain . When will I see you again ? I 'm going to Santa Barbara tomorrow . There 's a kind of gathering . Can I come ? It 's going to be very wild . Maybe that 's part of turning the key . To the god Pan . To the gods of this place . Drink ! See ye , ye gods . March down upon this procession ... and bless us all ! The queen of the wine ! Wine ! Wine ! The queen of the wine ! It 's the queen ! Oh , the queen ! The queen of the wine ! Stomp those grapes ! Stomp those grapes ! Stomp those grapes ! Stomp those grapes ! Stomp those grapes ! Stomp those grapes ! Stomp those grapes ! Stomp those grapes ! Now the season ends , and the old vines are buried deep . Now , in dying , Bacchus gives us his blood ... so we may be born again ... laughing , laughing . - Come dance with me . - Nora , I don 't know any of these people . - I don 't think I — - Don 't " think " me , Tony . Don 't . I came here to feel , to be . I 'm dying , and that 's the world ... the whole bloody world ! Nora , it 's not a question of dancing . I 'm not a part of this ! - I 'm dying , and that 's the world ! - I don 't understand ! - The whole bloody ... - Nora , please ! - world ! - No ! No ! Nora ! Nora ! Don 't ! Nora ! Nora ! Hey , Nora ! Nora ! Nora , come back here ! Get out of there ! Hey , wait a minute . Get your hands off me . Nora , get out of there ! Nora ! No , please . Please — Please don 't ! Please ! Stomp those grapes ! Stomp those grapes ! Stomp those grapes ! Nora ? Nora ! Nora . Please ! Nora ! - Nora . Nora ! - Kiss me ! Yes . Yes ! Yes , yes , yes ! - Thank you , John . - Oh , Mr. Wilson . - May I present Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd ? - How do you do ? This is your host , Mr. Wilson . - Mr. Filter , Mr. Wilson . - Pleased to meet you . How do you do , Tony ? - Hello , Mr. Wilson . - You have seen Tony 's paintings , haven 't you ? Cheers . Mr. Wilson , may I present Mr. Mayberry ? - Hi . - Nice to meet you , Mr. Wilson . Peekaboo . - Honey , please slow down . - Never ! Never ! Come . I 'm taking you to ze Casbah . Not ze Casbah ! As soon as these people leave , I 'm going to attack you . Why , Mr. Wilson , you dirty old man ! I really am . I want you to know that . I 'm counting on it . Miss Marcus , you shock me . Tony , please ease up . Hmm-mm . - Why ? - Because ... it 's not like you . Oh , I know that . I 'm sorry . Guess I just needed the added strength . Oh , that 's silly . They 're all wonderful people . Just give them a chance . - Okay , okay . - Give yourself a chance . Okay . Yes ? I promise . No more . And I promise to behave myself . I 'm sorry . Forgive me . I 've embarrassed you . No , you haven 't . Tony ... I think I love you . You 're beautiful ! You 're — - You 're an ocean . - Let 's go back . The sooner we get rid of those people ... the sooner we can be together . - I 'm going to hold you to your promise . - Oh , God . You 're evil ! - Yes ! - God , how evil you are ! Tony ? Henry Bushman , my husband . - Nice to know you , Wilson . - How do you do ? - Nora , you 're staggering . - Hank , that 's a dirty lie . Watch out for this character . He 's a lawyer . Harvard , I want you to know . - Really ? Hey , that 's a coincidence . - Hold it ! - Thank you . - Mm , me too . In fact , me too twice . Hollow leg again ? Oh , will you listen ? At home he makes me look like a piker . A veritable piker . Henry , you sneaking two-face , you . - Private joke ? - No . I 'm sorry . Come on , Nora . Let 's ditch these two sots . - Help , Tony ! Rape ! - Wait a minute . You can 't do that . No , there 's no way you 'll get away . You 're gonna stay right here . But that 's my woman . Hey . Hey ! Hey , that 's funny . That 's very funny . What 's funny ? Is he really a sneaky two-face ? Yes . There 's such a religious climate out here . Don 't you agree ? - Oh , I love the climate . - Yes . I belong to a special kind of group . Nothing subversive , I hope . Oh , good heavens , no ! We change sects . I beg your pardon ? Oh , no , no . Good heavens . You thought I meant — " Sects . " S-E-C-T-S . - Oh , sects ! - Yes . Well , thank God ! We change every month . Right now , we 're in Aztec . Huitzilopochtli , Quetzalcoatl , virgin sacrifice and all . I just love your paintings , Mr. Wilson . How do you ever do it ? Well , you see ... it all began with a big red ball ... and , uh — No , no . You see ... I paint naked , Mrs. Filter . - It 's the only way to get at the truth . - How interesting . Of course . You see , in this way , my inner essence is revealed ... and I am presented to the canvas ... in direct relationship with my primeval state ... without its sociological trappings . - Hey , watch it , will ya ? - Oh , look ! - Take it easy , Wilson ! - I 'm sorry . - I 'm terribly sorry . - You all right , hon ? John ! John ? - That 'll never come out . Never ! - I 'm terribly sorry . - Excuse me . Please forgive me . - Just look at this mess ! It 's all right , ma 'am . May I ? Let me take that . I 'm sure it won 't stain badly . Hey ! You two heard the one about the — Yes , we have . Well , I 'm — Well , I 'm sorry . I — I didn 't mean to interrupt . Seems like I 'm ... doing everything wrong lately . Now , don 't pout . Mama will make everything better , okay ? Perfect . Say , Hank ... uh , I was thinking about school just before ... and , uh , your house at Harvard ... wasn 't , by any chance , Adams , was it ? - No , not exactly . - Is anybody hungry ? Hey , I am . Say , Hank ? Hank ! Hey , Hank . Here . Hank , actually — actually , I 'm not a Harvard alumnus either . That is , I used to be , but I 'm not anymore . - What do you mean ? Did you resign ? - Take it easy . - Oh , that 's priceless ! - No ! I did go to Harvard , you see ... and I was an alumnus ... but that was before I became a painter ... and now I 'm not anymore . Come on , Hank ! Poor Eli 's hopes we 're dashing Into blue obscurity Resistless , our team sweeps goalward With the fury of ze blast We 'll fight For the name of Harvard Till the last white line is Passed That 's wonderful ! Absolutely wonderful ! Truth is , I just stopped being an alumnus . Simple . - Wilson ! - What ? You and I must play golf sometime . Golf ? Golf ? Antiochus Wilson playing golf ? Huh ? Now ... Arthur Hamilton — Looks as if our host is in orbit . Hey , wait a minute , you guys . - Incoming ! Good-bye ! - Bye ! Oh , isn 't he wonderful ? - Put him down . - Hey , wait a minute . - Turn him around . - Hey , Hank , listen . Hey , Hank , I got a nephew — I got a nephew right — right in Harvard right now ! - You don 't have a nephew . - What ? I don 't have a nephew ! Okay , correct . I don 't have a nephew ... but he 's there , all right . He 's there , all right . My daughter ... she 's married to a doctor ... and maybe by this time , I 'm a grandfather . Believe me ... they 'll never drag it out of me . I 'll stand right here ... on my constitutional rights . I 'm not a grandfather . I — Why are you all staring at me like that ? Hey , John ? Hey , John ! Why are they — Hey , John . Hey , John ... why are they staring at me like that ? They know . They know what ? They 're like you . What do you mean ? Reborns . Oh , Lord ! Shut up , you ! Shut up ! Shut up , damn you ! Just who the hell ... do you think you are ? Oh , no ! Oh , my God ! Yes ? It 's me , buddy . Now , listen to me . Arthur — Charlie ? - Now , look , Arthur — - Charlie . - Arthur , listen to me ! - Is it really you ? Of course it is . Do you realize how dangerous it is , what you 're doing ? Do you ? I 've got to get out of here . You don 't know what they 're doing to me . Come on , now , buddy . Calm down . Calm down . - I 've got to see you . - That 's impossible right now . - Why ? - It just is ! You 've got to get a hold of yourself , fast . You 'll be sorry — - You know what they did ? - I can 't explain , but you 'll be — There 's this reborn , Nora . She 's not one of them . She works for the company . - What ? - That 's right . An employee . But I — Oh , no . She was so — Why , Charlie ? Why ? Your adjustment was bound to be difficult in the first stages . Don 't you see ? The company simply provided — An employee . It means a lot to me personally , Arthur . Now , I can 't explain ... but we 're sort of tied together , you and me . We 're so close , Arthur . Don 't throw it away . - How ? - Trust , please ? Promise to stay put until we can get someone to you . You 've got to have some help right now . Please , will you do it ? Will you stay there ? Please ! Yes ? - I 'm Mr. Wilson . - Yes , sir . Come in , please . I 'll tell Mrs. Hamilton you 're here . Mr. Wilson ? I 'm so glad you were able to come . - Thank you . I didn 't mean to barge in . - Oh , not at all . It was very kind of you . I must have sounded strange over the phone , but ... you see , Arthur never mentioned — Well , I just met your late husband last year , shortly before — Yes . Um , please , sit down . Mrs. Hamilton , I 'm a painter — an artist , actually . - I admire your husband 's watercolors . - Really ? Not that he was professional ... but he did have something . He mentioned some paintings in a cupboard out in the garage . That 's the reason I — Well , I was wondering if I might ... pick one up as a memento . I 'm sorry , but the garage has been cleaned out . You threw them away ? No . No , not exactly . You have a lovely place here . Oh , thank you . This was the study , wasn 't it ? Yes , it was — How did you know ? Your husband ... talked a lot about this house , about his family . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to stir up painful memories . No . No , it 's not that . It 's just that ... I never knew Arthur to do that very much . How do you mean ? - I don 't want to bore you . - No , please . I 'd like to know . You see ... I knew him only for a short while . I 'd really like to know . It 's not just curiosity . We , uh — We shared an interest in art . The last time I saw him , I — I did some sketches . Now I 'd like to do a painting ... but all I have are lines ... a face . Posthumous portraiture , hmm ? I 'm not joking , Mrs. Hamilton . No , of course you 're not . I 'm sorry . I — You 've set me quite a task . He was a quiet man . I think the thing I most remember him for were his silences . It was ... as if he were always listening to something inside ... some voice . He never talked about it , so I never knew what it was . Oh , he was a good man ... but he lived as if he were a stranger here . I mean , he never let anything touch him . He became absorbed in things — his job , mostly . He worked hard . He ... became more detached . Always a look around his eyes as if he were ... trying to say something . I don 't know what . Protest against what he 'd surrendered his life to ? I never knew what he wanted ... and I don 't think he ever knew . He fought so hard for what he 'd been taught to want ... and when he got it , he just grew more and more confused . The silences grew longer . We never talked about it . We lived our lives in a polite ... celibate truce . You see , Arthur had been dead a long , long time ... before they found him in that hotel room . Well , I ... guess I can 't tell you much more . Enough ? Yes , it is . I really should be going . Well , I ... hope I 've been some help . Yes , you have . Very much . Mr. Wilson ? You said that you wanted a memento . It won 't be a painting , I 'm afraid , but it 's all I have . I 'm sorry , Mr. Wilson . It doesn 't matter . - I want to go back . - Of course , sir . No , I don 't mean to California . To the company . Start again , all over . Antiochus Wilson can die , can 't he , John ? The company . Is it possible ? I think so , sir . Begin again . Quite honestly ... I 'm not the least bit sorry ... because there were certain mistakes made in my case , and — Of course , but before we go into all that , let me ask you ... whether you can recommend and sponsor a new client . What ? Someone in your acquaintance outside ... whom you feel would benefit by the company 's services . You were sponsored yourself , you know . Oh , yes , of course . A business associate , perhaps . Someone down the street . You don 't have to be intimately acquainted with a man to realize ... he 'd be receptive to the sort of opportunity we offer . I 'm sorry . Right now , I just can 't seem to — What I mean is , I — I 'd like to think about it . Well , that 's all we ask . As you can imagine ... our business is acquired through present clients . It 's a word-of-mouth operation , Wilson . You don 't suppose we can advertise in magazines and newspapers . No , of course not . I think you 'll come up with something . Hold it . Thank you . Hold your arm up , please , Mr. Wilson . - Excuse me . I don 't understand . - That 's it . - Is all this really necessary ? - 13 1 / 2 . Profile . - Turn sideways . - Wait a moment . Is this necessary for — Hold it . That 's it . - Back view . - What is this , preliminary for surgery ? Certainly , Mr. Wilson . A year 's gone by . A lot happens to the human body . This one is yours , sir . Hello , Arthur . - Excuse me . I don 't believe I know you . - It 's me , buddy . Fidelis eternis . Charlie ? You 're Charlie ? Guess I am , old buddy . What are you doing here ? Same as yourself : waiting . What 's the matter ? Uh , nothing . I — It 's just that it 's ... hard to recognize somebody and ... not recognize them at the same time . How long have you been here ? Oh , a while . When you phoned me , you were here ? Even the first time ? But you sounded ... like the whole thing was something tremendous ... this ... rebirth , everything , even when you hadn 't made a go of it . I thought you 'd have a better chance . Good God ! How long does a man have to wait to get into surgery ? Not long , usually . I had to stay around and telephone you , if necessary ... through your first adjustment , but now — That 's what you meant about our being ... tied together . I couldn 't help it , Charlie . I had to find out where I went wrong . The years I 've spent ... trying to get all the things ... I was told were important ... that I was supposed to want ! Things ! Not people ... or meaning . Just ... things . And California was the same . They ... made the same decisions for me all over again ... and they were the same things , really . It 's gonna be different from now on . A new face , a new name . I 'll do the rest . I know it 's gonna be different . I suppose you do too . Good morning , gentlemen . Mr. Carlson , please . Charlie . You ? - Art , I — - Mr. Carlson , please . Charlie ... I have the feeling you 're gonna make it this time . Sorry to disappoint the rest of you . Perhaps tomorrow . You don 't seem to understand our problem , Mr. Wilson . - I understand it perfectly . - But you 're not cooperating . I 've told you over and over again , I cannot think of anyone . - I can 't believe that . - I 've been shuffled around long enough . It 's about time I had the opportunity to start living ... some kind of meaningful existence . If I did sponsor someone ... wouldn 't that delay my trip to surgery ... in the event that I were needed from time to time ... to , say , advise him ? No , that 's not likely , not if the selection is a good one . I 'm sorry . I don 't seem to be able to think of a single soul . - You mean you deliberately won 't . - Have it your way . Very well . That 'll be all , Mr. Wilson . You can go back to the dayroom . Processing , please . This is Ruby . On Wilson , 722 ... I think we can go to the next stage now . Hello , son . Oh , sir , I — Ah , you know , I sure hoped you 'd make it , find your dream come true . - What ? - I said , I sure hoped you 'd make it ... find your dream come true . I guess I — I guess I never had a dream . Maybe that 's it . That — That sure might have been it . If I did have one ... it certainly wasn 't ... Antiochus Wilson . This time ... I 've got to be allowed , sir , to make my own decision . You know , son ... when I began this business , I was a young man with an idea . I wasn 't aiming to make a lot of money , helping others ... helping them to find a little happiness . Oh , heck , just not the rich . I thought eventually — You see , I got tremendous comfort in the thought that , in my small way ... I was waging a battle against human misery ... and I was too . Except we do have a high percentage of failures . I guess that 's to be expected ... but it hurts me . Some reborns make a go of it . We 're always working to find ways to improve the system . Yeah , we make mistakes . Fact is , when our clients first started coming back here ... I just wanted to chuck the whole thing , but I couldn 't . The organization was pretty big by then . Board of directors , on a profit-sharing basis . All those people . You 've no idea what a financial responsibility it turned into . Heck , we make mistakes , but we admit ' em ... and go forward . I won 't see it in my lifetime ... but some of the younger execs like Ruby may . Oh , you can call it wishful thinking , son ... but life is built on wishes . And you 've got to just keep plugging away at ' em . You can 't give up ... and you can 't let the mistakes ... jeopardize the dream . Well , here 's your transportation . - What ? - Surgery , sir . - But I 've got to talk to you . - We 're on a very tight schedule . Please . Why , I — I didn 't expect so soon that — It 's efficiency . You 're lucky we got a match so quick . Hop aboard , son . Up there . The doctors are waiting . That 's just so you won 't fall off . But there 's things we have to talk about . I mean , my identity — We will . We will later . Mm-hmm . Just relax , son . Everything 's gonna be fine . Just fine . The thing about doing it on my own . You see , it 's so important : choice . You 've got to change . We have to talk about it . We will . I 'll look into it personally . Just remember , son , we gotta keep plugging away at the dream . The mistakes teach us how . It wasn 't wasted . Remember that . My name is Dr. Morris , sir . According to our records , you were reared in the Protestant faith . Did you convert to any other during your adjustment ? No . Good . Good . That is , " good " in the sense that we have a certain definition . Now , I am not suggesting that being a Protestant ... is any better than being a Catholic or Jew . As a matter of fact , I am qualified to care for you in either of those faiths as well . I was ordained in each : rabbi , priest , and minister . I admit it unusual . Uh , maybe even a bit advanced . Wait a minute . What 's happening ? Well , my good sir , when we have finished ... - you will go on to the next stage . - I don 't mean that ! Ultimately , Mr. Wilson , ultimately we 'll be called ... to face the Creator and render up our last account . It happens to all of us , sir . That 's no answer ! I want to know what 's happening to me now ! Don 't shout ! Please ! No ! " Blessed shalt thou be coming in ... and blessed shalt thou be in going out . And he said , 'Thou canst not see my face ... for no man can see me and live . " ' " I am the resurrection and the life . He that believeth in me ... though he were dead , yet shall he live . And the stranger shalt thou not oppress , seeing ye yourselves were strangers . " " He that loveth life shall lose it , and he that hateth his life ... in this world shall keep it unto life eternal . Fear not thou them which kill the body . " " I am the door . By me if any man enter in ... shall he be saved . " God be with you , sir . What 's his data ? " Wilson , mesomorph , age 51 ... no current diseases . Requisitioned from dayroom stock May 6 . Released for cadaver use last night . CPS number 722 . Disposition : death by automobile accident ... caused by cerebral hemorrhage . " - All right . Acid etch . - Yes , sir . - What 's the solution strength ? - Five percent at ten cc 's . Timer . Five minutes . You were my best work , Mr. Wilson . I 'm sorry it all has to end like this . All right , set him up . I think we 'll put the hemorrhage right under the left exoccipital ... in the lingual gyrus . Put that light over here . Good . All right . Relax , old friend . Cranial drill .

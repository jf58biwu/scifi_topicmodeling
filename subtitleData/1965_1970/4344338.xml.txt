 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . [ Thunder Crashing ] - Nice , hospitable place . - What 's that smell of sulfur ? There 's ground tremors , lightning , sulfur in the air . It all adds up to one thing . A volcano , and we could be standing right on top of it . Tropical growth . We 're not far from the equator . But where ? Things are getting rough . You know about volcanoes . What are the chances of this one blowing ? By the looks of things , I 'd say they were 1 00 % sure . - Is there any way of knowing when ? - It 's impossible to say . It could happen months from now , or in the next 1 0 seconds . - That 's not much help . - I haven 't got any information to go on . I don 't even know whether we 're on a mainland , an island or what . Wherever we are , it 's a long way from civilization . That 's for sure . [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] Hold it ! Put him down . - [ Speaking Native Language ] - Do you understand that ? - Sounds like Malay . - [ Malay Continues ] [ Speaking Malay ] America . So , from America ? - You speak English ? - Yes . - How many others live here ? - No one lives on this island anymore . - What about them ? - They came with me from Sumatra . You were trying to kill that boy . Why ? To appease the fires , there must be a human sacrifice . But this you know since you are devils . [ Thunder Crashing ] The earth trembles and spits fire . It 's because of you . [ Shouting In Malay ] Now we shall make it stop . [ Shouts In Malay ] [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . [ Shouts In Malay ] [ Shouts In Malay ] Release them at once ! What the blazes are you doing , Karnosu ? - Strangers , Too-ahn ! Devils from the sky . - Devils , my foot ! Now , listen , if you 're going back to this heathen superstition again ... - I 'll skin you alive . Do you understand ? - Yes , Too-ahn . This volcanic activity ... has absolutely nothing to do with evil spirits . Can 't you get that through your head ? - Yes , Too-ahn . - Then take your boys and go back to the camp . Yes , Too-ahn . [ Malay ] Ignorant , superstitious devils . Oh , I 'm Holland , Dr. Everett Holland . Who are you ? - I 'm Dr. Phillips . - I 'm Dr. Newman . - Medical or scholars ? - We 're scientists . Good ! I can use all the help I can get . - Royal Society sent you out here , eh ? - No , sir . We 're Americans . American . Well , then you 've no business here . This is my project . As a matter of fact , we 're lost . We 're not sure where we are . Really ? Then how the devil did you get here ? Where 's your boat ? - We don 't have one . - Oh , I see . Shipwrecked . Well , I 'm not surprised . These are treacherous waters . But , uh , which way 'd you come into Sunda Strait ? - Sunda Strait ? - Don 't you even know that much ? Look , here , to the southeast , is Java . And , of course , over to the north is Sumatra . - What is this called ? - This island ? It 's called Krakatoa . Krakatoa ? Of all the places in the world . The greatest explosion in history , and they 're sitting right on top of it . - What was the date ? - The early 1 880s . I 'm not certain . Ann , what time fix do you have ? 1 883 . Sometime in the late summer . I 'm trying to fix the exact time . 1 883 . That sounds ominously familiar . Jerry , Research will have everything on it . - Get me a complete report , and hurry , please . - Yes , sir . Ann ? Anything more definite ? It looks like late August . I 'm trying to pinpoint it . Will an exact date mean anything to them ? It will to Doug , General . He once had several papers published on volcanic activity . He 'll know the precise moment Krakatoa blew up . [ Thunder Crashing ] Our base . - How often do you get these ground tremors ? - Oh , intermittently . Bloody nuisance , but nothing much to bother about . - How long have you been on Krakatoa , Doctor ? - Little over a week . [ Chuckles ] As you see , we 're still not organized . Doctor , we have some questions to ask you . They may sound strange , but we 've got to have the answers . - I see . Go ahead . - What is today 's date ? Somewhere around the end of August , isn 't it ? - And the year ? - 1 883 , of course . - It checks . - Listen , are you fellas trying to pull my leg ? No , we 're dead serious , Doctor . - What day of the month is it ? - Oh , go on . Get out of here . I 'm busy . - What is the date , Doctor ? - [ Sighs ] I don 't know . Look , I haven 't got time for parlor games . Look , Doctor , this is vital . Have you any way of establishing the exact date ? Well , of course I have ! But I haven 't got time to drop everything and look it up for you . Listen , gentlemen , I 've been living and breathing this project ... ever since I first got word of that big explosion out here last May . Don 't you Yanks ever read the newspapers ? - Last May . - There was an explosion on Krakatoa in May of 1 883 . It was the first sign of the catastrophe . That explosion was the biggest thing this Earth of ours has ever experienced . They tell me it was heard from as far off as Batavia . That 's 1 00 miles from here . That 's true . It did happen . But that 's only the beginning . Yes , but nothing much has been happening since we got here ... beyond a little earth shaking ... and that 's a natural aftermath to a violent volcanic eruption . Doctor , we happen to know that Krakatoa is going to blow up . This whole island will go . It will be the biggest explosion on this planet in 3,000 years . That 's a pet theory of mine . This is no theory , Doctor . It 's fact . Theory , fact - Call it what you please . I 'm here to prove to the Royal Society ... that the pressure is building up ... and that someday , it 's going up with quite a big bang . Not someday , Doctor . Now . This month . Perhaps in a matter of hours . Oh , no , no , no . Your timing 's way off . There will be an explosion , but by my calculation , it 'll take 20 or 30 years from now . When I finish my work , I may be able to narrow that down a bit ... - but meanwhile , I - - [ Thunder Crashing ] [ Woman ] Father . ! Father . ! Help . ! [ Sobs ] Help ! Father ! - Thank you . - Are you hurt ? - Eve . Are you all right ? - I 'm all right . Yes , Father , I 'm all right , thanks to these gentlemen here . And I do thank you for rescuing me . These gentlemen are fellow scientists - Americans , of all things . This is my daughter , Eve Holland , and a darned good scientist in her own right . I 'm Dr. Phillips . It 's a pleasure to meet you . - How do you do ? - Tony Newman . Hello . Um , fellow scientists ? How odd you should show up here . It was quite by accident , I can assure you . They 're shipwrecked . Ha ! They didn 't even know they were on Krakatoa . Oh , really ? Now here 's a girl who 'd be able to give you the answer to your question . Mmm , what question is that ? They want to know the exact day of the month it is . Oh , well , it 's August 2 4 , I think . Or is it August 25 ? I don 't know . No , no . We must know exactly . Dig out your journal and give them the exact date . She 's been keeping a day-by-day record ever since we sailed from England . - May we see your journal , Miss Holland ? - No , you may not . Ha ! Well , there you have your answer , gentlemen . Exactly what do you suspect us of , Miss Holland ? I think it most curious that , uh , two ambitious , young scientists ... should just happen to appear on an uninhabited island ... at the very time that my father is about to carry out the most important research of his life . Oh , my dear . They 've explained their presence here . - They 're shipwrecked . - And you accept that ? Now they want to read all of our records . We don 't care about your records , Miss Holland . All we want is the date . You don 't have to show us the journal . Just check on the date . That 's all we 're asking . Oh , settle it any way you please . You 've wasted enough of my time . I 've got work to do . Father , don 't you ever learn ? Time after time , you 've made important scientific discoveries ... only to have someone come along at the last minute and grab up all the credit . Credit ! Good grief , girl . What do I care about credit ? You should care about credit . You could be famous by now . Yet outside the Royal Society , you 're scarcely known . That isn 't fair , and now you 're letting it happen again . You really think these men are after our research ? - Of course I do . - Well , I don 't . And I 'm sick of the whole business . Go look up the date for them and leave me alone . All right , Father . I only hope we 're not making a mistake . Where 's Jerry with that research ? We have no idea how much time is left . Ann , can you scan the volcano itself ? I can try , but we might lose our contact . I doubt it . We 're getting a fairly strong response now . Try it . All right . Ray ? What do you think ? Volcanoes aren 't my field , but that looks dangerously close to eruption . - That 's what I thought . - Here 's the research you needed on Krakatoa . Here we are - the exact time . 1 0 : 02 a.m. , August 27 , 1 883 . That 's awfully close to the time fix we 've got here . How close ? Can you tell ? No . Not accurately . Ray , I 'm worried about losing Doug and Tony . Can I switch back to them ? All right , Ann . Go ahead . All right , gentlemen . I have your information . - What is it ? - It 's August 26 . Doctor , do you have a map ? Can 't you see I 'm working ? We hate to bother you , but we need a map . You must have one around here somewhere . I - I think there 's one in the tent . August 26 . How long do we have ? We 're better off than I thought . Krakatoa didn 't blow till midmorning , August 27 . We 've got to find some safe spot for them . - Is there enough time ? - Barely , if we leave now . For where ? The area of destruction must have been enormous . Well , it was . That 's why I need this map . We 've got to decide right now where it 's safe to go . If we only had precise information . - [ Sighs ] - [ Thunder Crashing ] It 's all right here - everything they need to know . If only we had a way to get it to them . What does it say , sir ? How bad was the explosion ? More than 25 times as powerful as the biggest H-bomb ever built . The noise was heard plainly at a distance of over 3,000 miles . Dust and debris were carried around the world two and a half times . What chance have they got to escape a thing like that ? There 's no time for them to get far enough away . Well , maybe there is . Doug seems to think so . According to this , most of the casualties were as a result of the enormous tidal waves . Ray , you know , we could check it out ourselves . Ann could move our fix just far enough ahead to let us see the results . And risk losing all contact ? She 's right . What good would it do ? It could confirm our research , tell us whether there really is a chance of survival and where . If there 's no other place close enough ? Then we 're gonna have to take our biggest risk of all . We 're gonna have to try to move all those people through time . That 's impossible , sir . We couldn 't do it . We may have to . Ray , what do you think ? [ Sighs ] All right . Ann , move our fix ahead a bit . Not too much . Let 's see what we can pick up . Go ahead , Ann . Move it . It may be our chance to save them . All right . Here it goes . [ Flips Switch ] A tidal wave . Must be right after the explosion . Ann , what are your spatial coordinates ? We 're looking northwest , toward Krakatoa . Look at the size of that wave . How big was it ? It was big enough to sink over 5,000 ships ... and it 's heading right toward Java . Do we still have a fix on Tony and Doug ? Try it . Java might be our best bet . Okay.Java it is . Oh , wait . The fix slipped forward again . That 's after the explosion , farther inland on Java . [ Screaming ] It 's night . What happened to your time fix ? I don 't know . It 's supposed to be midday . It was . The sky was almost completely blacked out from the explosion . Ray , what were the casualties ? How many people died there ? Over 36,000 . One of the greatest tragedies of all time ... and they 're heading right into it . Dr. Holland ? Get out of here . I 'm busy . We 've got to get off this island within the hour . - Who says so ? - It 's going to blow up . There 's barely time for us to get to safety , and your boats are the only way off the island . Once and for all , Krakatoa is not going to blow up for years . That 's what I 'm here to prove . You 're wrong . You see that lightning ? It 's a phenomena connected with violent volcanic eruptions . Lightning is a phenomenon ... that has to do with thunderstorms , and that is all . You 've got to believe me . We know what we 're talking about . Then get off the island ! No one 's stopping you . Just leave me alone . I want to work . - Anything , Ray ? - A gold mine of facts . They confirm the very things we saw in the image area . - Can they reach a safe place if they start soon enough ? - Not if they head forjava . The higher elevations along the coast of Sumatra went untouched . We have the information . They don 't . They 're gonna be heading straight into a trap . Excuse me . What about trying the new isolation techniques we 've been working on ? There 's a lot of work to be done before we 're ready for that . I can help , if you 'll let me use the RC-7 computer . - All right , Jerry . Go ahead . - Thank you , sir . - Miss Holland . - Oh , it 's you . We can 't get anywhere talking to your father . I need your help . I can 't help you . My father speaks for me . What 's the matter ? Are you afraid of him ? No , certainly not , but I do respect him . I 'm trying to save his life and yours ! I think you know very well what you 're trying to do . My father says the tremors are growing weaker , not stronger . Dr. Newman , please . This research is vital to my father . I , uh - I even have reason to believe he may be knighted for it . And it means that much to you ? Oh , not the honors themselves , but vindication for him . He 's had so many disappointments , and , uh ... he 's trusted so many people who 've then cheated him of his fame . Now all at once there 's a chance for everything to be made right . Don 't take that away from him . How can I make you understand we 're not rivals of your father 's ? All we want is to get you off this island to a safe place . And so we 're to give up everything , huh - just all of our work - on your word that we 're in danger ? Yes , I 'm afraid that 's the way it is . I 'm afraid you don 't know my father . His work is the only important thing in his life . Nothing else matters to him , not even , um ... well , his safety . My advice to you , Dr. Newman , is to just forget about us . Just go away and leave us alone . [ Thunder Crashing ] - How 'd you do ? - I can 't make her believe me . How ' bout you ? - Like father , like daughter . - We can 't stay on this island much longer . I know . Look , we 've given them every warning . Why don 't we think of ourselves for a change ? There are two boats . We 'll take one and get out of here while we can . I guess that 's all we can do now . Maybe they 'll come to their senses in time to get themselves off . I sure hope so . - Too-ahn ! - Yes , Karnosu . What is it ? I am worried , Too-ahn . The earth was very angry , and now the sky . Forget it . There 's nothing to worry about ... yet . There is bad trouble on Krakatoa . All right . If you 're so scared , blast it , clear out ! Take one of the canoes and go . Just let me get on with my work . I will not leave Krakatoa . It is my home . You left it fast enough last May ... when the big explosion came . I am full of shame for that . I had forgotten the teachings of my forefathers . Are we back to this childish superstition again ? The earth grows angry . There must be a sacrifice to the fires . Now , listen , I 've heard enough of that talk . I warned you ! But now I know the reason for Krakatoa 's wrath . - Oh , you do , do you ? - Yes . The two strangers . I saw them come from the sky . Like magic they appeared . Only devils can do that , but we know well how to handle devils . Listen to me , Karnosu ! If you do anything to those men ... I 'll have your neck when we get back to civilization . - Do you hear ? - Yes , Too-ahn . I hear . The sky 's getting darker . Yeah , it looks real bad . Doug , there 's only one boat . Who could have taken it ? Karnosu ? You know what this means , don 't you ? We can 't leave the Hollands stranded . We 're gonna have to stay . - We 're right back where we started . - Yeah . Something 's very wrong with their timetable . - I don 't know what it is , but it 's wrong . - I agree . The eruption certainly doesn 't look more than a few hours away . Dr. Swain . I 've worked it out . The details of your isolation theory . - Look at these figures . - Let 's see , Jerry . Well , what is it ? What 's your theory ? Risky , certainly , but it may be worth a try . Jerry , give General Kirk a quick rundown . Well , sir , you see , moving in time is all a matter of rapid acceleration . That means concentrating a great deal of energy into an extremely small area . All right . Now , what 's your idea ? The trouble has been trying to move both men simultaneously . The energy is dissipated , erratic . That 's why we 've had no control over where they went . The plan is to focus on one man and pour an enormous burst of energy through our transmitters . It will work . I 'm sure of it . And the computer seems to verify it . What about the danger of an overload ? It could damage our controls . - Yes , I agree , and there 's something else . - What 's that , sir ? The danger of a feedback . The power of the magnitude that you suggest could affect our whole complex . Well , how , sir ? Well , we 'll have to get more data to answer that question , Jerry . Ann , this is in your department . Will you check out the figures , please , and bring us a report ? It 'll take time . Do we have it ? - I wish I knew . - Go ahead , Ann . Check them out . - Yes , sir . - Jerry , you take over the controls . Yes , sir . Treacherous beggars . Ha ! They 're like a lot of unruly children . But it wasn 't Karnosu who went off . I was talking to him just now . It doesn 't matter who it was . Look , we can 't strand you here , and we 've got to get off this island ! And we 're going to if we have to drag all of you off . Now listen to me , gentlemen . If I prove to you that you 're wrong , will you please stop bothering me ? Look . Here are my records . They prove that the tremors are getting weaker and weaker ... not stronger . The next one will be weaker still ... till finally they disappear . That points to just one fact - no immediate explosion . Now , will you please let me get back to my work ? [ Sighs ] It 's too late . This is the big one . I thought we had it that time . Maybe it brought him to his senses . Maybe . So the shocks will grow noticeably weaker , will they , Doctor ? Feel the ground , Holland ! It 's getting hot ! You 've known all along . Your instruments must have recorded all of it . Yes , blast you . I admit it . I was lying . The pressure is not diminishing . It 's increasing rapidly . Much too rapidly . [ Sighs ] Yes , I knew it all along . But I couldn 't tell anyone else . - Why not ? - Don 't be stupid , Doctor . Who 'd have stayed on this island if they 'd known it was going to blow up ? Does your daughter know ? My daughter is a dedicated scientist , Doctor . - But don 't you think that 's her decision ? - Mind your own bloody business . [ Loud Rumbling ] Just how much time do you figure before the explosion ? Well , I did think it would be a matter of weeks ... but now I think it 's days . Hours , Doctor . Only hours . We know when the explosion will come . We know exactly . 1 0 : 00 a.m. , August 27 . That 's tomorrow morning , Doctor . [ Chuckles ] How could you know the exact time ? It 's enough that we do know . [ Sighs ] Well , I don 't believe you ... but still ... by your own admission , we still have some time left , haven 't we ? A few hours only , and it 's a long way to safety . Whatever the risk , I 've got to stay . - You 're mad , Doctor . - Am I ? [ Sighs ] Is it sane to leave this island ... when a few more hours will give me data ... that this part of the world is needing desperately ? I 'll tell your daughter . She has a right to make her own decision . You needn 't bother . I 'll see that she gets off here in time . What kind of scientists are you ? Can 't you see the importance of making measurements ... from a volcano within hours of its eruption ? - What do you think , Doug ? - It 's cutting it awfully thin . It 'll still give us enough time to get toJava . All right , Doctor , but we 're leaving here first thing this afternoon . [ Chuckles ] I 've ... only a few hours and so much to do . Something 's wrong , Tony . What ? I can 't understand this pressure buildup continuing this long . - Are you certain about the August 27 date ? - I am . At the rate this ground temperature 's building ... the eruption 's got to come soon . Then what could be wrong ? I don 't know . But I 'm gonna have a good look at this journal . No doubt about it . It 's going to blow higher than a kite ! But then they were right . We 'd better leave the island immediately . Leave ? When we have an opportunity of making the most important observations ever recorded ? Not a chance . Eve , you 've got to help me with these readings . But what about the eruption ? [ Scoffs ] We 've time enough to get away . Not if the whole island is going to explode . - We 've time , I tell you ! - Please , let 's not take the chance . Will you stop whining and do as I tell you ? I am not leaving this island and neither are you ... until I have the data I want ! [ Whimpering ] Father , you 're hurting me . And I told them that you were a dedicated scientist . Go ! Leave me . No , Father . Wait . Um , I 'll do whatever you say . [ Rumbling ] Did you discover anything , Ann ? Enough to worry me . Well , what is it ? The isolation plan could work . What about the power feedback ? A distinct possibility , even a probability . How much damage would it do to our equipment ? That isn 't what concerns her , General , or me . Whatever damage is done can be repaired . We can accept that risk . But this could be something else . A power feedback could produce a time warp here in the Tunnel . What effect would that have ? That 's the point . We don 't know . We have no way of calculating . In that case , I veto the plan . General , they 'll all be killed back there . We still have some elbow room - 2 4 hours , at least , before we have to act . In that time , we should be able to come up with some less dangerous plan . I think you 're right . We 'll go on that assumption . - Find anything ? - I think so . - I 'm almost afraid to check it out . - What is it ? Wait a minute . I want to make absolutely certain . The little fool . This could cost all of us our lives . Something wrong with her records ? Her records are accurate , but she 's made one small mistake . - What is it ? - When they left England , they were on Greenwich mean time . - But they sailed west . - West from England ? Why would they do that ? They were following the great earthquake belt that rims the Pacific . They went down through the Straits of Magellan and west across the Pacific . - They crossed the international dateline . - Exactly . And she forgot they lost a day . This isn 't August 26 . This is August 27 . The 27 th ? And this morning , Krakatoa blows up . It 's too late . There 's not enough time to get away . No . We might have a fighting chance if we leave right now ... and head straight forjava . Let 's find Holland and tell him . Come on . [ Shouting In Malay ] Soon the ground will no longer shake , and Krakatoa will no longer smoke . Throw them to the fire ! [ Shouts In Malay ] There 's no time left . They 'll be killed . We 've got to act now . Ray , there 's only one thing to do . We 've got to risk your plan . - It 'll work . I know it will . - Ann , what do you think ? If we do nothing , we 're condemning them to death . I say it 's worth any risk . Very well then . I don 't know what this is going to do to us , but we 'll see . Ann , which one can you get the best spatial focus on ? Right now , Tony . All right . Bring him back . Yes , sir . [ Malay ] [ Malay ] [ Karnosu Shouts ] [ Tony ] The Tunnel . I 'm back . Doug ! Doc ! Doc ! General ! I 'm back ! [ Panting ] What ? General ? What is it ? Doc . Can you hear me ? Can you move ? Ann . Can any of you move ? Jerry ! I don 't understand what 's happened . It doesn 't make any sense . A time warp . That 's what it is - a time warp . That 's why you can 't hear me , isn 't it ? You 're frozen here between two split seconds of time . Will the controls work in a time warp ? Oh , they work ! If I can just reverse them without changing the setting . [ Electrical Whirring ] [ Tunnel Oscillating ] Doc ... I 'm going to send myself back . I 've got to get back and help Doug . You can return ... us together . We 'll be at time-space ... coordinates 1 7 6 ... and 3 20 ... 1 000 hours ... plus one minute ... 45 seconds ... Krakatoa time . [ Screaming ] All right . We 're all leaving Krakatoa now . Find Holland and his daughter , Tony . - We 'll manage to get them all toJava somehow . - No , notJava . Look at this . Sumatra ? The high ground just inland . - Where the devil did you get this ? - I 'll tell you later . I 'll find the Hollands . Come on . I know it isn 't possible , but Tony had to be here . There 's the note he left . And our research is gone . He must have taken it with him . - Ray , how can you explain it ? - The time warp , obviously . Tony came back with such great acceleration ... he was able to do all these things in between two beats of a microsecond of time . He was here , and we couldn 't even see him ? That 's about the size of it . - And he went back - deliberately went back . - He had to , Ann , to save Doug . Can we let them know somehow that we got the message ? They 'll know that when we switch them . I mean now , so they 'll be certain . What ' bout voice contact ? It hasn 't worked for us yet . We got a good fix . Maybe it will this time . Patch me in . I 'm gonna try . [ Sighs ] All right . Ann ? Come on . We 're leaving the island . No , my father ordered me to stay here . Well , I 'm ordering you to leave . Where is your father ? - Answer me ! - [ Kirk 's Voice ] Tony . Tony , can you hear me ? General ? - Who are you ? - Travelers in time . That voice comes from nearly a hundred years in the future . That 's how we know about Krakatoa and when it blew up . It 's all history to us . Oh , no . It isn 't true . It couldn 't be . General ! I hear you . Can you read me ? Affirmative . We got the note you left for the time-space coordinates . - Will you both be there ? - We 'll be there . Will you be able to switch us ? General ! They 've lost contact . That 's the first voice contact we 've had . That voice - it came from the future ? Yes . Now do you believe me ? I 'll take you to my father . Father . ! Father , I need to talk to you . Yes , I know . I heard . I heard ! We leave Krakatoa at once . What happened ? Where 's the other canoe ? It was stolen by one of the natives . - But there are too many of us for one boat . - Doug . There 's room for them without us . I 've made arrangements with the Time Tunnel to get us off . - How ? - I 'll tell you later . Let 's get them aboard . - Are you coming with us ? - No . - You 're not leaving ? - There are too many of us . We 'd swamp the canoe . - What 's going to happen to you ? - We 'll get off . You 'll just have to believe me . Good-bye , Dr. Phillips . Thank you . - Bye . - Good-bye . - Take these and head straight for the coast of Sumatra . - Thank you . The safe areas are outlined in those papers . - Follow the directions . - Good luck . Thank you . Thank you , both of you . Let 's get to the coordinates . They 're about to switch us . Timing is vital now . Stand by for the order to switch . Ready and counting . Seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Now ! What 's wrong ? We 're getting interference . It 's affected our power output . - Why ? What 's doing it ? - I was afraid of that . The forces are building in the volcano and affecting our instrumentation . We 'll have to make adjustments to compensate . - How do we get them back now ? - Well , we don 't , General . But , Ray , we can still try to switch them to some other place . If we override the interference and time . - Jerry , get the emergency crews on those circuits . - Yes , sir . - Why haven 't they switched us ? - Something must have gone wrong . They got the note I left . I had voice contact with Kirk . They must have tried and failed . We lost the best chance we had to get back . They 'll try again . Maybe this time they won 't fail . Doug ! Feel the ground . It 's almost too hot to stand on . I know ! There 's not much time left ! You think the Hollands made it to Sumatra ? They should have by now , just barely . Look at the sky . ! It 's pitch-black . ! I know . It 'll be like that all day , only we won 't be around to see it . Look ! Here it goes ! The whole island ! You all right ? Where are we ? - Do we have a reading on the time zone they 're in ? - Sometime before 1 00 B.C. - We 'll have to do better than that . - Before 500 B.C. [ Men Shouting ] [ Galloping Hoofbeats ] [ Doug ] We 're right in the middle of no-man 's-land . - They 'll cut us to ribbons . - Let 's get over behind these rocks ! 600 B.C. 7 00 ? 800 , 1 000 . 1 200 . - Stabilized at 1 200 B.C. - Where ? Space-time coordinates , 389-58 . About where Greece and Turkey meet at the Hellespont . [ Shouting ] [ Swords Clanging ] Die , Trojan !

 * * Okay , fellas , you can knock it off . Yeah , I know . Well , Carter , now what I am supposed to do ? Now , nothing . If you had come out last night when I called , maybe you would have ... I did that last month . You were too late that , too . Carter , look , my men and I have got more important things to do than to chase around in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night because you thought you saw a flying saucer . You know what I think ? I don 't think you need a cop . I think you need a doctor . These things don 't make any more sense than you do . Well , next time , I 'll use a better camera . Don 't bother . Just get in the car , and I 'll take you back to town . Sheriff ! It 's over here ! I told him the wind would carry it . Jimmy , what do you say ? Thanks . It 's busted . Look at the way they make kids toys nowadays . Cheap plastic- - it breaks the minute you ... Do you live around here , sir ? Couple of miles . Did you notice anything different or strange in the sky around here- - last night , for instance ? No . Last night or any other time . Why ? What 's up ? Nothing . Thanks a lot . NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Anne Francis ... Charles Drake ... Dabney Coleman . A man has seen a flying saucer- - an old and familiar story to David Vincent . But John Carter swears he can predict the day and place when another saucer will land . If true , he could bring to an end Vincent 's continuing war against the invader . David Vincent ? Yeah . I 'm Vincent . John Carter . Follow me . How are you ? Took you quite a while , huh ? Well , that 's not much of a road back there . Is this where you saw them ? Yeah , both times . Both times on the last night of the last quarter of the moon- - like tonight- - and , always , one hour before dawn . You mentioned photographs in your letter . Yeah . I see you brought a better camera than I had . Got them right in here . Here you go . Thank you . You said to bring a gun , so I ... I borrowed this one . It 's loaded with double-ought buckshot . All right . They ought to be here pretty soon . Let 's go on over here . Annie ? How do you feel ? Where are we ? Almost to Tucson . We going to stay over and get some sleep ? Well , I sort of hoped we 'd keep going . Once we 're in Mexico , it 's over . Yeah , but they won 't be looking for us until Monday morning . I know that . Annie , I 'll give you anything in this world except ... What can 't I have ? The chance to change your mind . Okay . Mexico , next stop . They should have been here an hour ago . Oh , you can 't keep them on a timetable , even if you have seen them twice . You don 't really buy this , do you ? I 'm here . Well , that 's a lot further than anybody else would come . Ever since this thing started , everybody 's pretty well got me pegged as some kind of a kook . Guess I 've given them a little help . What do you mean ? Oh , an unpublished writer living alone in a beat-up house with four cats and a motorbike . If you had known me ... would ... would you have come ? Sure . It 's 5 : 00 . They won 't be coming now . Well , let 's give them a few more minutes anyway . Look , I appreciate your coming down , but it 's daylight . You can 't expect them to put one ... Vincent . ( shaking and rattling ) What happened ? I don 't know . The engines just cut out . ( stick mechanism rattling ) Well , can 't you do something ? I 'm trying to land . Let 's get closer . There 's a spot . It 's full of rocks , but that 's all there is . Robert ! ( loud crash ) * * * * ( rock clatters ) Use it ! Carter ! Yeah . You all right ? Yeah . And did you see how they went up like that ? I don 't think there are any more of them down there . Well , the saucer could be full of them . Maybe . ( shutter clicks ) Annie . Mmm . Annie , you all right ? I think so . All right . Better try and get out of here . Will it explode ? I don 't think so . Something happened to the ... electrical system on the way down . It 's a good thing . There 's gasoline all over the place . Well , we 're very lucky then . I 'll call the plane rental people and tell them where to pick up the pieces . What 's next on the schedule ? I 've made a hash of things . I 'm sorry , Annie . It 's not your fault . You hurt your ankle . Oh , it 's just a little sprain . I 'll get us to Mexico ... Europe , Riviera , just the way I promised . Not exactly the way you said . Running away from the police is a little harder with a sprained ankle . Annie ... did you see anything ... big and bright on the way down , on your side ? Did you notice anything ? The ground coming up . Well ... it 's a long way to Mexico . Shouldn 't we do something ? I 'll , uh ... rent a car and come back for the luggage . Have you got the blueprints ? Yeah . CARTER : It looks empty . * * * * Well , it looks like we 've got ourselves a saucer . Now , what are we gonna do with it ? Who 's the most important man you know in town ? The sheriff , but I could never get him out here again , if that 's what you 're thinking . Well , you must know someone . Wait a minute- - Joe Bonning . He , he may be in town . He 's in the state assembly . I , uh , used to be a friend of his . At least , I went to high school with him a hundred years ago . All right . Get Bonning to come out here as soon as you can , and get him to bring the sheriff . It might work . Here , take my car keys . No , I 'll , I 'll take the bike- - it 'll be faster . Now , listen , David , uh ... I-I want to thank you for coming . This is a pretty big deal for me , and ... Just get Bonning to come out here and you 'll be nominated for the Hall of Fame . Here , why don 't you take this ? I hope you won 't have to use it . Okay . You should take something from the ship . To show Bonning . Yeah . Right . How 's this ? That 's perfect . All right , I 'll see you later . ( shutter clicks ) ( shutter clicks ) ( shutter clicks ) ( shutter clicks ) * * What is it ? Remember when I asked you if you saw something big and shiny when we were coming down ? This must have been it . Don 't go any closer . Well , if there was somebody in there who wanted to hurt us , they would have done it by now . * * Hold it right there . Back down . Back away . Put your hands up . Look , we don 't mean you any ... Turn around . Both of you . One hand behind your back . Get up . Am I gonna live ? I 'm sorry . I had to make sure you weren 't one of them . Them ? The beings who brought this thing here . They have no pulse . I-I 'm a scientist , an electrical engineer . Do you mind if I get a closer look at this thing , Mister , uh ... ? Vincent . David Vincent . Bob Morrison . Annie Rhodes . I 'm sorry . I , I wasn 't supposed to say our real names . You see , we 're , uh ... eloping . Well , can I ? Go ahead . Annie ? If you figure out how to fly it , count me out . We just crashed our plane . One a day is all my doctor allows . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . We missed almost every rock in the field . Well ... this promises to be quite an adventure . Maybe . I hate to seem na√Øve , but what do you do with one of these things once you catch it ? First thing you do is send a friend for help . In this case , a state assemblyman is coming out , and the police . They 're coming out here ? Now ? That 's right . So you 're not in any danger . What happened to the , uh ... beings ? Did you mow them all down ? I 'm not as bloodthirsty as it may sound . Well , it sounds pretty awful . Why isn 't it ? They want to take over this planet . They 'll destroy us to get it . You some kind of an expert on them ? I 've seen them before . And you believe ? Every word . ( footsteps approaching ) Annie ! You 've never seen anything like that in your life . Why , they 're light-years ahead of anything I 've ever dreamed of . Why , I could spend ten years ... Well , as a matter of fact , in about ten minutes an assemblyman and a few policemen are gonna be coming here , so I don 't think you 're gonna have that chance , Robert . If there are any beings around , how could a girl get out of here , say , if she panicked ? Well , I have a car just beyond those rocks . There 's nothing to worry about . The police are on their way . May I take your pulse ? ( engine revs ) ( rings doorbell ) WOMAN : I 'm coming . What is it ? I 've got to see Mr. Bonning right away . At 6 : 00 in the morning ? Look , tell him it 's John Carter from high school and it 's urgent- - he 'll remember . Now , will you please get him for me ? Uh ... mister , you got to do me a favor . My kid 's sick and I left the house without any money . I need some change for a phone call . I 'll pay you back . Sure . Thank you . You won 't be sorry . ( phone ringing ) Yes . All right . You know what to do . ( brief buzzing ) ( whirring ) ( bell rings ) * * Mr. Vincent , when are your friends going to be here ? They 'll be here soon . And we 'll be here , too . Mr. Vincent , this state assemblyman- - don 't you think this thing is too important for just some local politician ? Well , he was available . Why not go right to the top ? I know how fantastic this thing is . I don 't even think it uses fuel . Probably got some magnetic drive principle that we 've never even heard about . Now , I could call ... So could someone else , Robert , while we 're on our way to Mexico . Who would you call ? The man I work for . He 's done subcontract work on all the Apollo projects . ANNIE : He wouldn 't listen to you . Now , why don 't you just let that assemblyman do it . Of course , he would listen , Annie . Why ? Are you the first man who ever saw a flying saucer ? Who are you ? Why are you so important ? You mean because I don 't have any money ? Is that it again ? No . Then why can 't I ? Because of the envelope in your pocket . Annie , this is so enormous . I think we should see it through . Could we live with ourselves if we ... Glad you came , Sam . Get in . Joe , I tried to tell you on the phone , this Carter 's a nut ! He 's already had me out there twice ... Yeah , I know Sam . He told me all about it . It 's different this time . There 's a saucer out there . And there 's a man guarding it . You really believe him , don 't you ? I 've know John for a long time . Yeah , so have I- - too long . John , let 's show it to him , huh ? All right , what is it ? It 's from the saucer , out of the control room . Well , I 'm not saying I believe it , you understand , but ... well , maybe we better get started . ( whispering ) : Robert . I got his car keys out of his jacket . Now we can get out of here . Annie . Well , he said it was right over there beyond those rocks . Steal his car ? Borrow his car ... until we catch a plane . We can 't do that . What are we ? Well , it isn 't as if you 've never stolen anything before . DAVID : Taking longer than I thought . I 'm going to have a look around . We got the money . All we have to do is drive out of here . Well , what 's more important to you- - that thing or me ? You 're important to me , Annie . You 're everything . Why does the money have to be so important ? I don 't know . It just does . Well , maybe if all your father had left you was a $ 20 gold piece and a bag full of good wishes , it 'd mean the same to you . But to steal ... Robert , that was your choice . But you helped make it- - you wouldn 't have come if ... Is that what you 're going to tell the police ? That I made you steal those blueprints ? Well , I 'm not waiting around here to get arrested . I 'm getting out . Annie , there 's , there 's something ... I want you to come with me , but I 'm going with or without you . You 're always giving me choices , Annie . Well , I 'm staying . Sure . Well , what do you need me for ? You got your saucer and your $ 250,000 worth of blueprints . If they mean that much to you ... here , take them . What happened ? Car ... skidded off the road . I- - I could ... Let 's get him into ours , huh ? Easy picking him up ... easy now . Take it easy . You all right ? I don 't think anything 's busted . I 'm pretty shook up , though . Come on , we 'll get you some help as soon as we can . I 'm sure glad you came along . I could 've been lying out there for weeks . So you see , Sam ? Something good has come out of this trip already . ( engine starting ) ( tires squealing ) Why did she take my car ? I don 't know . She calls you a thief , takes my car and you don 't know ! What is it with you two ? ! Mr. Vincent ... I need that car . Our lives may depend on it . The whole world may depend on it . Will you shut up ? Will you just shut up ? I 've just lost everything in my world and I couldn 't care less about yours ! Now if you 'll be quiet , I 'll tell you about it . My company had some blueprints for a new computer . I don 't know whose idea it was to take them , hers or mine , but ... they would have brought a quarter of a million dollars in Europe , enough for us to live happily ever after on . Amen . That still doesn 't explain why she took my car . She took your car because I told her I was going to stay here with you and see it through . She didn 't want to be here when the police came . Well , you took the blueprints . I am a fool and a sloppy sentimentalist , Mr. Vincent , but I am not a thief . As she will find out when she ... sees that the envelope is full of blank paper . * * Sheriff , what ... It 's one of them , Joe ! ( tires screeching ) ( buzzing ) God in heaven ... it 's true ... what you said about them . Yeah . I got to get you to the government . I 've got friends that ... ( groans ) You 'll be doing the world a favor , Joe . No , not ... not me . You 're the one that ... ( groans ) ( truck approaching ) Help ! There are two men down there . They 're trapped in a car . They need help . You were with the others at the saucer . What ? What are you doing ? ! Wha ... ! No ! No , wait a minute ! Those men need help ! * * What were you thinking ? When ? When you led your woman to believe you stole for her ? I wanted Annie to come with me . Look , at it from her point of view , if she thought I had money , if she thought I 'd give her everything in the world- - Mexico , Europe , everything . Well , when were you going to tell her the truth ? When my $ 975 ran out . I thought she 'd love me by then . Let me get a job over there . Oh , I don 't know what I thought . Better get inside the saucer . Is that your friend ? I 'm sorry you got into this . You should have taken off with Annie . You in the ship , there is a small switch at the right of the control panel . If you press it , I 'll be able to hear you . What do you want ? That belongs to us . Not anymore . We only want the ship . You can go . We 'll take it and leave . Are you going to let them ? I want this ship . So do I. All we want is this ship . We have something of yours , too . They 've got Annie , David . They 'll kill her ! Wait a minute , wait a minute . Can you figure out how to disable this ship if I can 't get back ? Yeah . Then you wait here . Your friend 's still in the ship . Prepared to shoot out the control panel if he has to . What 's your offer ? He comes out and we go in . Release the girl . After he 's out of the ship . Release the girl and he 'll come down . No . You could get the girl out and your friend could still cripple the ship . All right , we 'll stand over there and cover you while you come send one man in to check it out . I 'm not sure you trust us . One more detail . Your camera . Thanks . Is she all right ? We made a deal . You trust them ? No . Don 't come down until I tell you . Annie ! Yes . Start walking to me . One of you go to the ship . Tell him to leave his gun up there . What 's happening ? What are you doing ? We 're making a trade . What , me for the saucer ? But you can 't do that . They murdered your friends . You 've got to keep the saucer . You can 't just hand it to them . You 're more important to us . Now both of you , come down . Without me , they have nothing to bargain with . Keep your saucer . I 'm getting out of here . Stop ! Look out ! Get down ! * * ( gunshot ) ( saucer whirring ) ( groans ) We 've got to get an ambulance out here . Thanks . She 'd be lost without it . She 's been burned , Doctor , badly . Her arm and shoulder . How 'd it happen ? Well , we were ... Does it matter ? No . We better get her to the ambulance . The man I work for- - I 'm going to tell him everything we saw . Well , no matter what you say , it 's not going to make much difference now that we don 't have that saucer . I know that , but I 'll tell him anyway . First thing back at work , Monday morning . ANNIE : Robert ... I 'm here , Annie . Open my purse . Can we take these back ? We don 't need them anymore . I think you 'd better tell her . NARRATOR : Two other have seen what David Vincent has seen . Two others now know that flying saucers do exist . The search for Congressman Bonning and Police Chief Thorn will continue for months . Because of their disappearance , dozens of others will begin to wonder ... reluctant to believe what David Vincent knows is true : that alien beings from another galaxy now walk the face of the Earth .

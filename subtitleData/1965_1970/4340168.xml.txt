 Hey , Hank , I need some more lines . HANK : Okay , Phil . Hank . Hey , Hank , what 's the mater ? Hey , I need that line . Hank . Wait a minute . Hey , Hank . Hey , what 's the matter , Phil ? Your partner , he 's had a heart attack . Heart attack ? Phil . Phil , are you okay ? Through the window , up there I saw a man . He was glowing like he was on fire . They were putting him into some kind of a tube . - I swear , Phil . - Maybe you better let us take care- - Get out of here . I 'll take care of him . NARRATOR : The Invaders . A Quinn Martin Production . Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders : alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination : the Earth . Their purpose : to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road , looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Jack Lord , Alfred Ryder , and special guest star , Diana Hyland . NARRATOR : David Vincent had read the story in the newspapers how before he died , a telephone lineman had described to his partner a glowing burning man . The story was investigated by the police and promptly forgotten . Seeking the truth , David Vincent travelled to Fort Scott , Florida , headquarters of Vikor Enterprises and perhaps headquarters for a people from an alien world . Couldn 't leave it alone , could you ? The other telephone lineman had to die , too , huh ? Accidents will happen , Mr. Vikor . He had an accident . Well , I don 't want any more accidents , is that understood ? I 've had my bellyful of being questioned . - The police seem satisfied . - Well , I 'm not . Look , Mr. Nexus , killing hasn 't bothered me in a long time , but stupidity does . What would have you have had us do , Mr. Vikor ? Nothing . Nobody would have believed him , nobody did . What happens next time somebody stumbles onto something ? I sincerely hope there won 't be a next time . Mr. Vikor , if it 's your conscience that 's bothering you- - I told you my reasons for objecting . Well , if it is conscience , try to remember the importance of what we 're doing here and your stake in it . Sometimes I wonder if it 's worth it . You make it sound very attractive , Mr. Nexus . But how do I know you 'll keep your part of the bargain ? How do I know ? You 'll have all the power you could possibly use , Mr. Vikor . Take my word . [ INTERCOM BUZZES ] I told you to hold my calls , Harriet . Who ? Yeah , I 'll take it . Hello , sergeant . What 's the problem ? Is she all right ? Yeah . I see . Yeah , I 'll be right down . You 'll have to excuse me , Mr. Nexus . It 's my wife . She 's had a little trouble . I won 't be long . Whatever you say , Mr. Vikor . GUARD : Yes , sir ? - I 'm looking for work . Well , the personnel department isn 't taking any applications right now . If you care to leave your name and address . Yes , Daniel Baxter . I 'm at the downtown Y. Even if it 's unskilled , I 'm not fussy . - Do you drive , Mr. Baxter ? - Sure . I may have something for you later on . I 'll let you know . Okay , fine . I 'm George Vikor . I understand my wife is here . This way , Mr. Vikor . She was doing almost 90 when we stopped her . That 's the second time in less than a month . Are you gonna file charges ? Well , she 's been drinking too . I 'm pretty sure of it . See what you can do , sergeant , huh ? - Hi . - What happened ? It was another long afternoon and you were lonely ? Oh , George , I only had two martinis . Oh , George , you gotta tell me something . Where am I headed for ? Devil 's Island and 30 days on a rock pile ? - Now , I understand rock piles- - - Sherri , what 's wrong with you ? You could 've killed yourself out there . Killed ? Oh , George , why would I do a thing like that ? I mean , haven 't I got everything that any woman would want ? I mean , I have a beautiful house and beautiful clothes and all the beautiful money that money can buy . I even recall having a husband once . That 's not fair . Come on . I 've gotta get back to the plant . All right , George . You just run along and stop by any time you- - Sherri , be reasonable , will you ? I left a top-level meeting to come here . I thought you were the top level . That 's just the point . I am . I can 't walk away from my obligations . I 've got hundreds of people working for me and soon I 'll have hundreds more . One of these days , I 'll hand you the world . I 'd settle just for you and me . All set , Mr. Vikor . Thank you , sergeant . We 're very grateful . Come on , let 's go . No rock pile ? Your husband has a lot of influence , Mrs. Vikor . But next time , it may not help . There won 't be a next time , sergeant . My wife won 't be doing any driving for a while . I won 't be doing any driving ? How do you expect me to get around , on a skateboard ? Let me worry about that , huh ? My name is Daniel Baxter , the new chauffeur . I 'd like to see Mrs. Vikor . I 'll see if she can see you . Come in . There 's a Mr. Baxter outside who says he 's your new chauffeur . What ? - Mr. Baxter ? - Yes , ma 'am . My houseboy tells me you 're my new chauffeur . Oh , Mr. Vikor didn 't telephone you ? No , he did not . Well , I 'm sure he meant to . He hired me only an hour ago . Well , there 's obviously been some misunderstanding . Mr. Vikor , please . You know , this is perfectly ridiculous . I don 't need anyone to do my driving . Harriet , this is Mrs. Vikor . Is my husband there ? Oh , when do you expect him ? No , that 's all right . I 'm having lunch with him . I 'll see him later . Thank you . Shall I drive you to the plant ? I am perfectly capable of driving myself . Thank you . Oh , yes , ma 'am , but Mr. Vikor gave me your keys and I 'm not to give them to you under any circumstances . - Really ? - Yes , ma 'am . Really ? Would you bring the car around to the front . - I 'll be down shortly . - Yes , ma 'am . - You wait here . I 'll be awhile . - Yes ma 'am . May I look around ? Sure . You 've been here before , haven 't you ? A couple of hours ago for my interview . Do what you like . Don 't go in the security building . They 're sensitive to strangers . And call Chicago , Harriet . Tell them not to expect me . The way things are happening , I 'll never get out of here . - Well . - Forgive me , darling . I know you 're busy , busy , busy , and I 'm early , early , early . But there is a little matter I 'd like to discuss with you . The chauffeur . Now , you must admit , it 's just a trifle silly . [ INTERCOM BUZZES ] Look , Sherri , I happen to love you very much . I don 't relish the idea of scraping you off the highway . George . Or bailing you out of a drunk tank . That is sheer nonsense . [ INTERCOM BUZZING ] Yes ? Well , tell Mr. Nexus I 'll see him in a minute . One of my new investors . He 's only here for a few days . I 'm sorry , honey , but I can 't keep him waiting . Why not ? He 's very important . - So are you . - Yeah , maybe . This time I 'm not gonna settle for second or third best . I 'm going all the way . These people can make me the biggest , - most influential man in the- - - The cemetery . [ INTERCOM BUZZING ] George , I don 't understand this . They buzz , you jump . Now , who are these people ? What are they doing to you ? I 've told you . They 're foreign businessmen . - They 're here to- - NEXUS : I was afraid- - Mrs. Vikor . I was afraid that you had forgotten us . Gentlemen . - What 's this all about ? - Ask him , sir . He says he 's your chauffeur , Mr. Vikor . That 's right , he is . He entered the plant with Mrs. Vikor at 11 : 47 . At 11 : 57 , he was found in the security section . What were you doing up there ? I was looking for your office , sir . You were here this morning . My office is not in the security building . I 'm sorry , sir . I was lost . These buildings are all alike . I was on my way to tell Mrs. Vikor that I was going to the gas station . The car is out of gas . When these storm troopers jumped me . Sherri , will you excuse us a minute ? George , if you don 't mind , I think I 'll cancel lunch . - Dan , will you drive me home ? VIKOR : We won 't keep him long . I 'd rather not wait . I said we won 't keep him long ! All right . Go ahead . I questioned the man thoroughly this morning . He 's no professional . I 'm sure of it . If he was from the FBI or Air Force Intelligence , he wouldn 't have been caught that easily . If you don 't trust my judgement , Mr. Nexus , why don 't you check him out yourself . Find out who he is and why he 's here . Whatever you say , Mr. Vikor . If there 's nothing else , I 'll put the car away now . There is something else . - Would you like a drink ? - No , thank you . You lied about the gasoline , Dan . I filled that tank myself last night . The truth . Why were you in the security building ? A foolish mistake . I don 't believe you . The lies you told . The way they treated you when you were caught . The way my husband 's been behaving , his phoney story about the investors . I think he 's manufacturing something other than industrial machinery at that plant . And I think you know what it is , that 's why you 're here . All right . Your husband is working for a foreign power . They 're planning a form of invasion . Invasion ? What foreign power ? I can 't tell you that . What do you mean you can 't tell me that ? You 've just accused my husband of treason . Now , Dan , you 've got to be specific . I can 't accept some meaningless , empty charge . They 're alien beings . Creatures from another planet . They 're here now , trying to take over . Your husband is helping them . Specific enough ? Alien beings from another planet ? You don 't really believe that , do you ? I 've seen their spaceships . - Who hasn 't ? Half the- - - I 've seen them too . Aren 't you a privileged minority ? I 'm not alone . Others have seen them . They certainly keeping it a secret , aren 't they ? - You 've seen them too . - I 've seen them ? At the plant . Some of them had mutated hands , a crooked fourth finger . I don 't believe it . Why would George be helping them ? Ask him . This is a stupid joke . A stupid , tasteless joke . I don 't enjoy your sense of humour , Mr. Baxter . I think you better leave . You wanted the truth . Goodbye . Dan . Dan , please ... Tell me what we can do to help him . EDWARD [ ON RECORDING ] : This is Edward McEndrick , reporting to you from a joint session of the state legislature . In a moment , Sergeant George Vikor , winner of the presidential medal of valour , will be coming down the aisle to accept the congratulations of the 98 representatives gathered here . On October 23rd 1952 , Sergeant Vikor led , drove and forced his exhausted platoon to glory . For three months , all attempts to take Hill 317 from the enemy had failed . But on that bleak October morning , Sergeant Vikor did not fail . Losing his entire platoon , he fought on alone to the top , personally killing over 30 of the enemy . And then , badly wounded himself , radioed battalion headquarters that Hill 317 was ours . Yes , it is a moment in history that can never be- - [ CROWD CHEERING ON RECORDING ] Wait a minute , there he is . Sergeant Vikor has just made his appearance . [ CROWD CHEERING ON RECORDING ] [ REPLAYS RECORDING OF CROWD CHEERING ] [ TURNS UP THE VOLUME ] - Good evening , Mrs. Vikor . - Good evening . My husband 's working late . He needs this . - Could you take it to him ? - Certainly . Thank you . [ DOOR OPENING ] [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] VIKOR : We 're building up a heavy backlog on these tubes , Mr. Nexus . I think we 'll have enough for your new arrivals . NEXUS : You think ? Mr. Vikor , thinking isn 't good enough . Without these tubes , my people cannot maintain their human form . We 've got to do more than think , Mr. Vikor . We 've got to be sure . Soon there will be thousands of my people here . We must have your absolute guarantee that you will fill the new production quotas . All right , you 've got it . But you 've got to give me more- - [ PHONE RINGING ] Yes ? Yes , what is it , Harriet ? When did it come in ? Yes , I 'll be right down . Teletype just came in . They 've got some information on that chauffeur I hired . [ ALARM SOUNDS ] Yes , yes . Real name : David Vincent , architect from Santa Barbara , California . He 's reported alien activities to police , newspapers and public officials . Hello , this is Nexus . There 's been some trouble . Thanks . Oh , officer , can you stop for a minute ? I need your help . Sure thing . Climb in , Mr. Vincent . [ UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS ] SHERRI : Hello ? - Mrs. Vikor ? Dan , where are you ? I 've been worried sick about you . - Are you alone ? - Yes , I am now . But listen , they were here a while ago looking for you . I think we ought to call the police . Well , not these police . Some of them are aliens . I can 't hear you . I said some of the local police are aliens . We have to go to the FBI office in Miami . Well , I 'll call them for you . Well , first , I have to get out of this area . Will you give me some help ? I need your car . Okay , where are you ? A place called Wilson 's Tavern . Wilson 's , Wilson 's , Wilson 's ... . Oh , yes , I know where that is . I 'll leave right away . I 'll be there in a half hour . Are you all right ? Take this . Thank you . Let 's go . I 'll drive . COP : All right , Mr. Vincent . End of the line . Vincent ? How did you know where to find me ? She told us . You bugged my home . - The police have no right to- - - It wasn 't the police , ma 'am . In the car , Vincent . VIKOR : All right , sergeant , I 'll take care of these two . COP : Sorry , Mr. Vikor . VIKOR : Let 's go inside . COP : Just a minute . Mr. Nexus gave me specific orders that I was to- - I said I 'd take care of this , sergeant . COP : Keep an eye on the back door . We 'll wait , Mr. Vikor . [ UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS ] This man broke into our plant , Sherri . Why are you helping him ? George , I know all about your foreign investors . Why they are here and how you 've been helping them . What kind of poison have you been feeding her ? She knows what 's going on at the plant . The regeneration chamber , the tubes you 're manufacturing . That 's what you told her , huh ? Your source of information is a psycho , Sherri . His real name is David Vincent . He 's a mental case . He 's been treated for delusions and fantasies . Tells wild stories about things that simply don 't exist . Take her to the plant , Vikor . Third floor , security building . Show her how crazy I am . The man is sick , Sherri . He 's sick . I 'd like to go to the plant , George . Now . Why , George ? Why are you doing this awful thing ? For you . I want you to have everything . - I had everything , remember ? - Don 't you understand , Sherri ? They 'll be running this planet , and we 'll be right on top with them . We 'll have everything we ever wanted . Excellent terms . All you have to do is sell out the human race . Yeah , our precious human race . Liars , phoneys , hypocrites . When I came back from Korea , I was the big war hero . Medals , interviews , all kinds of fancy promises until I really needed help . All I asked for was a small loan to start a crummy sheet metal shop . George , don 't . That 's when I got my lesson in humanity . They told me a guy with a wooden leg and a plate in his head was a lousy financial risk . " Sorry , chum , business is business . " The only place you can borrow money on a medal of valour is in a hock shop . Their promises are as phoney as they are . So I made a promise of my own . I swore that someday , somehow , I 'd be the man in charge . I 'd be the one to say no . It 's nice you 'll be the man in charge . You can see your wife has a proper funeral . She knows too much about them . They 'll kill her . They wouldn 't dare . They wouldn 't touch her . I 'll see to that . How ? You wanted the world , now you 've got it . What are you gonna do ? Give it to them or destroy them ? - No , no , they 'd destroy me first . - They 're gonna do that anyway . They 're gonna do that anyway , after they 've finished using you . Now , you 've got every piece of evidence we need to get rid of them . George , help us . You 're the only one who can . Sherri , I swear to you , I never thought you 'd be in danger . - I never realised- - - Then do something about it . We 're running out of time . All right . All right , but it might take some doing . You 'll have to trust me . Let me do it my way , make it look good . Otherwise , they 'll kill both of you right now . DAVID : Just give me enough time to get to the FBI . Come on , let 's go . Take Mr. Vincent to the plant , sergeant . Make sure nothing happens to him . - I 'm sorry . Mr. Nexus told me to- - - I said take him to the plant . We need him for questioning . Keep him under guard in my office until you hear from me or Mr. Nexus . All right , Vincent , let 's go . Will he be all right ? I told you to trust me . Come on , I 'll take you home . We 'll send for your car later . George , you are going to go through with this , aren 't you ? Do you think I 'd let anything happen to you ? What about David Vincent ? He 'll be all right . Why don 't you go upstairs now and get some rest . I 'll call Mr. Nexus and get this settled . Okay . Sherri . The things you found out tonight- - The things I 've done , I- - George . After tonight , nothing matters at all . Nothing . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] What are you doing here ? I was just about to call you . I 've got David Vincent under guard at the plant . And your wife ? She 's upstairs . Why ? Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Where do you think you 're going ? No . No ! I 'm not gonna let you do it . You 've got no right . You 've got Vincent . Now , what do you want with my wife ? Look , she 'll give you no more trouble . SHERRI : George , when are you coming up ? - Take your hands off her . NEXUS : Mr. Vikor . - Take your hands off her ! NEXUS : Mr. Vikor ! We must all make sacrifices . I delivered Vincent , didn 't I ? Isn 't that enough ? Now , tell them to leave her alone . There 'll be no pain . It 'll be a simple suicide . An unhappy woman who drank too much and drove too fast and finally turned on the gas . Dear God , George , help me . George , what are you doing ? I can 't let you do it . Must I ... remind you of the rewards that lie ahead ? Wealth and power beyond your wildest dreams . A slave population of billions , but you won 't be a slave . You 'll be a master . You 're a very sensible man , Mr. Vikor . How can you possibly give up so much for so little ? SHERRI : George ? Help ! [ PHONE RINGS ] Hello ? Yes . We 'll take care of it immediately . [ GUNSHOTS ] [ GAS HISSING ] [ DOOR RATTLING ] Sherri ? Sherri . Come on , Sherrie . SHERRI : George . George , please help me . DAVID : Breathe deeply . Come on , breathe deeply . Deep breaths . [ SHERRI INHALES ] Deep breaths . Hello , George ? Yeah , she 's all right . I got here just in time . It was a good idea giving me that gun . Right . Right . You just let them think that I 'm responsible . The government wants you to remain undercover . You 're the key man , George . You 're the only one who can help destroy them . George , Sherri sends her best . DAVID [ ON RECORDING ] : Hello , George ? Yeah , she 's all right . I got here just in time . It was a good idea giving me that gun . Right . Right . You just let them think that I 'm responsible . The government wants you to remain undercover . You 're the key man , George . You 're the only one who can help destroy them . George , Sherri sends her best . No . He 's lying ! He 's framing me , can 't you understand that ? I didn 't betray you . He 's framing me , can 't you see that ? I didn 't betray you ! I didn 't ! It 's obvious- - [ GRUNTING ] Any luck ? Nothing . They destroyed every shred of evidence in the security building . Do you think they 'll keep after us ? No . Not anymore . Now that your husband is ... . You know , the police said he died of a cerebral haemorrhage . It 's not true . He started dying years ago when he was given these . It takes a lot of courage to get one of those . And to do what you did . Well , I have to go . Where ? Wherever they went . How long are you going to go on like this ? As long as it takes . Goodbye . David ? Goodbye . NARRATOR : As the invaders move , so does David Vincent . For they must be stopped . They must be exposed . And if he doesn 't do it , who will ?

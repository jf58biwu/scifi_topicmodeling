 [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire Continues ] The American Civil War . Come on ! [ Dog Barking ] Fermo , Cesare . Fermo . All right , men , let 's get out of here ! You too ! Major , over here ! Help , Major . ! We need a doctor . He 's beyond any hope this world can give him now . He 's dead . He can 't be dead . - He can 't ! - Amplify his signal . I 'm sorry , General , but there is no signal . That could only happen if he - I won 't accept it . Maybe there 's been a malfunction in the equipment . Come on , Ray . Let 's check it out . Quickly . [ Beeping ] Well ? Everything 's working , General . Doug 's signal is still coming in strong . There 's nothing else it can be ? [ Sighs ] No . Well , we 've lost the trail . The tracks disappear into the stream . This is as far as I go , Major . If you 're going the rest of the way , you 're gonna have to do it alone . - I 'm going back for my friend . - Wait a minute ! You wouldn 't stand a chance getting through those Confederates alone . You help me , and I 'll go back there with you ... - and we 'll see that your friend gets a decent burial . - [ Bullet Ricochets ] Well , you with me ? [ Sighs ] All right . But if I 'm gonna risk my life for you , I 'd like to know what 's going on around here . The man in black stole a wagon containing 1 50 kegs of gunpowder from us ... and those Rebs back there wanna get their hands on it . So we gotta get it back or destroy it . We 've gotta find out where those tracks come out . I 'll try upstream . You go downstream . Here . You better put these on . They might save your life . Wait a minute , Major . I 'm no soldier . You think those clothes make you a civilian ? You get caught on a battlefield , you 're a soldier . Look at those boys . Do you think they 're soldiers by choice ? Huh ? Here . Get those on . We 'll meet back here in 1 5 minutes . Major , what 's the name of this place ? Gettysburg . [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . [ Gunfire ] The odds were against both of them surviving . We 've known that for a long time . We 'll close down Tony 's channel . By concentrating full power on Doug , we may be able to save him . - I won 't let you do it . - If you can think of anything we can do , Ann . Anything . General , will you let me try a power surge ? Perhaps the shock - Well , it could work . All right . Make the try . I 'll monitor . I 'm afraid we can 't wait any longer . General . ! It worked ! He 's alive ! He 's comin ' around , Sergeant . Corporal , you find Private Acton . Tell him to get a horse , report to Captain Vickers at the supply train . He is to tell him that we found the courier alive . Yes , sir . - Corporal ! - Yes , sir ? I 'd be obliged if you 'd wait until I 'd finished the instructions . Yes , sir . He is to tell him that he doesn 't have the money on him . - Well , move ! - Yes , sir . And be careful with them Yankee snipers ! They 're usin ' real bullets ! Kids . They oughta be home shooting ' possum . Here . This 'll make you feel better . You 'll be all right . Important thing is you got through , Lieutenant . - Lieutenant ? - Well , you 're Lieutenant Andrews , ain 't ya ? You were sent here to lead us to a man named Michaels . What do you remember ? Nothing . No , wait . There was an explosion . I remember that . I was running , and there was an explosion . Do you know me ? Have you seen me before ? No , sir . You 're part of Longstreet 's corps . We got a message to meet you here . I may not be this lieutenant at all . It 's not very likely . There ain 't no civilians around here ... two days of battle . Well , here . Brought this uniform for ya . May not fit ya , but it 'll save you from being shot as a spy . Sergeant Maddox ! Sergeant Maddox ! Get down ! [ Dog Barking , Howling ] Michaels 's dog . He 's howlin ' for all the men who are gonna die here . I 've had enough of your crazy superstitions ! You understand me ? Yes , sir . That Yankee major who left the lieutenant for dead - He 's lookin ' for Michaels too . We 'll track him . Like as not , he 'll lead us right to him . - Cover me , Corporal . I 'll get the lieutenant . - Yes , sir . Lieutenant . Let 's ready to move out . - Find anything ? - Not a sign of anything . Michaels and that dog must 've crossed over to the other side . If we 're lucky ... we 'll be able to find their trail before nightfall . Come on . - Major . Here are their tracks , all right . - Good . The Rebs oughta be showing up any minute now . They 're lookin for a courier with $ 2,000 ... to negotiate with Michaels . Fortunately for us ... that courier isn 't gonna make it . We got word that he was killed . I want you to follow this trail while it 's still light . I 'll give the Rebs 1 0 minutes . If they don 't show by then , we 'll know they lost the scent . Do you believe in ... omens , Lieutenant ? There 's some strange things goin ' on here . What do you mean ? Well , I can 't explain it , but I feel it . I 've been in some battles before , but ... never like this . What battles you been in , Lieutenant ? I don 't remember , Corporal . Well , maybe you 're the lucky one after all . Some things , it 's better not to remember . Them tracks are all over the place . No tellin ' where they crossed . The corporal and I 'll take this bank . Will you be good enough to take the other side , Lieutenant ? Sure . Sergeant , let me take the other side . I think I can hunt ' em out . All right , Corporal . You 're on your own . And don 't be no hero . If you see anything , give us a yell . You understand ? Yes , sir . - Is he alone ? - As far as I know . He stepped out a minute ago and looked around and then went right back in . [ Barking ] - I 'm just wonderin ' . - About what ? Why that dog isn 't setting ' up a racket . Yeah , I know . Weird , isn 't it ? - Well , at least he 's chained . - All right . Cover me . I 'm gonna try and take him alive . [ Barking ] All right , Michaels , on your feet ! There 's no need to break the door in , Major . My house is yours . Avanti , signor . [ Dog Barking ] Oh . Scusi . It is against his nature to sit by when he considers his master 's life threatened . Zitto , Cesare . Basta . Basta . Basta . Basta . He fears the wrath will fall on him if he disobeyed me . Avanti , signor . Avanti . Come in . I suppose you 've come about the gunpowder . You will surrender it , sir , or I 'll kill you where you stand . But you have no need for the gunpowder , Major . You already have sufficient supplies . - Wine , gentlemen . - You are under arrest . War is only interesting when the sides are evenly matched . Don 't you agree ? I was just setting down a principle in my book The Art of War . " " Reduced to essentials ... war is nothing more than a conflict of one man against another . " Surely you wouldn 't want to take unfair advantage of an adversary ? For example ... you have an unfair advantage of me now , Major . Two against one . Not a very gallant affair , is it ? But should the odds be changed - Suddenly , the conflict becomes more exciting . [ Groans ] The major has seen my point . Perhaps you will too . Mille grazie . Instruments of death come in such intriguing forms . This weapon of yours is very effective ... but do not underestimate the rapier . Just who are you ? Let us say I am the superior here . [ Groaning ] The major needs help . All right . But quid pro quo - something for something . Your major can provide me information concerning this most interesting war . How can you bargain while a man is bleeding to death ? [ Groaning ] Only a stupid man does not press the advantage when he has it . Still , sometimes the advantage is increased by delay . There 's a cot in the storeroom . Do what you can for him . I 'll try to stop the bleeding . No . No , there 's - There 's no time for that . [ Coughing , Groaning ] Listen to me . - He 's a madman . You know that , don 't you ? - Yes . He must be stopped . [ Coughing ] He must be stopped . He will be stopped , Major . I promise you that . I - I hate to die ... and not know ... whether the Union ... will ever - The Union will survive , Major . The Confederates will be stopped here . They 'll begin their retreat to the South . The final peace will come at a small town called Appomattox . Two equal weapons . Interesting . Who are you ? Where did you come from ? Let us say I come from another place , another time . That box in there - Impossible . Machiavelli died four centuries ago . Then you know me . My works did outlive my era . My rule in Florence . History remembers me , huh ? Not as a ruler . As a man of evil , of cunning . As the most hated philosopher of planned carnage in the history of mankind . You call it carnage , but I call it the highest achievement of man . Bella . ! Bravissimo , signore . You really have gone too far now . Much too far . That was the last bottle of my fine Italian wine . My Orvieto ! Finito . I 'm not acquainted with your weapons , but I learn quickly . - How did you get here ? - I wish I knew . I had just returned to Florence from the camp of Prince Borgia ... and was preparing to unpack when I was seized with all my goods ... and whirled through a maelstrom which left me here . The Time Tunnel . As luck would have it , I have fallen into the most wonderful war . An opportunity to see the refinements of my theories . Oh , if only the Romans had had your equipment . That 's incredible . How could Machiavelli have been switched through time ? We have the only operative transfer mechanism . Then his being there must have something to do with the Time Tunnel . See if you can get a signal for him . [ Monitor Beeping ] There 's our answer , General . A one-in-a-million coincidence ... but his signal is identical to Doug 's . Machiavelli somehow switched through time on Doug 's frequency ? General ? - Here are those pictures you ordered . - Oh , good . Now . First ... we 'll sort out all the pictures of cabins . Sir , how long do battlefield cases of amnesia persist ? Oh , I 've seen some boys come out of it in hours ... and I 've seen others who never regained their identity . But we 've got something much more important than that to worry about at the moment . - Machiavelli ? - Yes . We sent him there . It 's our duty to get him out . You think we can send him back to his own time ? I don 't know , General . If his signal is interlocked with Doug 's - We 'll have to find some way to separate their signals . Ann , I want the date that Machiavelli returned to Florence from the camp of Prince Borgia . I 'll get on it right away . Those are checked . Here . - [ Barking ] - That 's Michaels 's dog , all right . He 's got visitors . We 're gonna have to flush them out before we can talk to him . [ Barking Continues ] I think you 'll need this . - You expect me to fight them ? - Unless you prefer to let them kill you . [ Gunshot ] Better cover the door as well . Don 't move ! Tony . - What happened to you ? - Take his gun . Well , what 's the matter with you ? Don 't you recognize me ? You stay put ... or I 'll kill you just like you killed my corporal . The other one 's in there . He 's dead , I 'm afraid . - Are you Michaels ? - Yes . You have 1 50 kegs of gunpowder . We want it . - And you shall have it . - There 's no money in this . No bargains . The money 's not important . Your side is the weaker side here . Unless you have the firepower , the battle will be most uninteresting . The gunpowder is in a cave above Wilson 's Creek . The foot of the suspension bridge . I know the place . But you - I don 't understand you . - What do you get out of this ? - I ? I am merely an observer . Nothing more . A historian in search of knowledge . I want to know the disposition of your forces . You make this war sound like some kind of mental exercise . Precisely , and of the highest order . Nothing would make him happier than to increase the slaughter on both sides . And you 'd like nothing more than to keep us from getting to that gunpowder . It doesn 't make any difference whether the South gets it or not ... not in the long run . You don 't remember me , do you ? I 'm Douglas Phillips , and you 're Tony Newman . We came here together . Is that true , Lieutenant ? You know this man ? I 've never seen him before . I 've never been a member of the Union army . Neither of us were . You were injured in an explosion . I thought you were killed . He did have civilian clothes on him when we first saw him ... like you did . Don 't you remember anything ? The Tunnel ? General Kirk or Ann ? Well , you 're not even from this time . You 're trying to save your own skin with some cock-and-bull story . All right . If you 're not Tony Newman , who are you ? My name is Andrews . I 'm a courier , mister , for General Longstreet . Why , that courier was killed . The major told me so before he died . Now , wait a minute . Did he say how much money the courier was carrying ? - Yes . $ 2,000 . - That 's right . You are a member of the troop that ambushed me . You took the $ 2,000 ! You killed my corporal ! And , mister ... I 'm gonna kill you . There 's really no sport in killing an unarmed ad - [ Barking ] Cesare ! - [ Italian ] - [ Barking ] The mastiff will tear Doug apart ! Have you made the adjustment for the time reversal ? My time setting is January 3 , 1 51 9 ... the date we lifted Machiavelli out of Florence . I tried to separate his signal from Doug 's ... but I don 't know what may happen when we activate . - Lock in on the mastiff ! . - I 'm locked in and tracking it . [ Grunting ] Back ! Back off ! . [ Shouts ] - We did it ! We did it ! - He 's not out of danger yet . Tony 's on his way . Can you get Doug out of there ? Well , if we move Doug , what about Tony ? We 'll hold the fix and try to get Tony out later . Something 's happened to our power . - How long will it take to repair it ? - I don 't know , General . I 'll check it . Now , listen to me ! Just let me explain . That 's all I ask . All right . Do you know how old that corporal was ? He was 1 6 . And that justifies your killing me ? I don 't need any justification ! You 're the enemy ! I 'm the only friend you have . All right , so that explosion took your memory ... and watching that boy die made you mad . I don 't blame you . But if you kill me , you kill your only link with the past or your future . Take that gun out ... carefully . Tony , use your head . I 've had this gun all along . If I wanted to kill you , I could 've killed you from the rock . I said take it out ! Now throw it over there . - None of this makes any sense to you at all , does it ? - None of it . Look . If Michaels carries out his plans ... this is gonna be the bloodiest battleground in the entire Civil War . Get up . Now , we 're gonna join the sergeant . You give me the slightest excuse , and I 'll kill you . Is that clear ? Let 's go . Come on ! I have a report from the generating station . It 'll take eight hours to bring the power up to peak . Eight hours ? You know , that sergeant mentioned something about a suspension bridge . Here . This must 've been the one he was talking about . Let me see . Yes . There it is . Ann , find the coordinates of that bridge and feed them into the console . We 'll have our fix preset by the time they approach it . Then we 'll retrieve Tony and Doug when they reach it ? No . No , we won 't . I will not leave Machiavelli on the field . We 'll send him back to his own time as we did the mastiff . He 's far too dangerous . He can 't change what happened at Gettysburg . I 'm not gonna take any chances . It 's our duty to get him out of there . All right . I understand how you feel , General . Even if we 're willing to risk Doug 's life ... - we don 't have power enough . - We 'll find supplementary power . You saw the explosion that followed the transfer of the dog . It 'll take three times that power to transfer a human . We can 't do it . - You have a better suggestion ? - No . If we overload our circuits that much , there 's no telling what will happen . - General , I 'm against it . - I 'm sorry , Ray . This is the one time I have to overrule you . I want that programming done as quickly as possible . When it 's complete , notify me . Please . I 'll make the changes , General ... but heaven help Tony and Doug if you 're wrong . You think I 'm wrong too ? I don 't know . We have a responsibility here ... not only to science , but to humanity as well . [ Gunfire ] They ride like the Horsemen of the Apocalypse ... bringing death closer with every stride . Do you have that feeling of tight excitement within you , Sergeant ? That fascination with impending death ? You sure do run off at the mouth , don 't you ? Union cavalry , sir . They 're attacking our supply train . It 's a fortunate circumstance , Lieutenant ... that this type of artillery was nonexistent in ancient times ... else the Romans would not have conquered so easily . But the use of firearms prevents men from displaying personal valor . Don 't you agree ? We 'll need at least two of those wagons to move the gunpowder . They may never survive the attack , sir . There 's a wagon and horses at the cave . I 'll try to get another wagon and an escort . We 've got to get that gunpowder through . That 's the most important thing right now . Tony , don 't go . You 'll never make it . Sergeant , you guard the prisoner . If he tries to escape , kill him . Michaels . We 're moving up into higher ground . [ Whinnies ] Why 'd you do it ? What do you want with me ? You 're gonna have to trust me . What I told you before was the truth . We 're gonna have to find a landmark and wait to be picked up . - Picked up ? - I could explain it to you . But in your condition , I don 't expect you to believe me . We 've got to stop Michaels , and we 've got to destroy the powder . You know , you almost had me there for a minute . It would be easier for you to get at that gunpowder through me , wouldn 't it ? Are you all right ? Don 't make the mistake of doubting it . Come on . I would say you have just about outlived your usefulness . Wouldn 't you , Sergeant ? After all ... you couldn 't possibly help us to move the gunpowder . And you walk with only the greatest difficulty . [ Groans ] You would impair our mobility . A good field commander always destroys those things ... which are detrimental to his cause . That 's just common sense , isn 't it ? I 'm a better man than you ... half dead . Then I suggest you prove that , Sergeant . Otherwise , I intend to kill you . [ Laughing ] [ Laughing Continues ] You see , I 've always had the advantage . Your prisoner almost succeeded in telling you the truth . I am indeed Machiavelli - a man in a time long past his own and , therefore , already dead . [ Sniffing ] Ah ! They smashed us to pieces and swept on . Like a whirlwind scattering death in its wake , eh ? Tell me , Lieutenant ... does not your mind quicken in the presence of such destruction ? - What happened to him ? - Oh , poor fellow . Felled by a final fusillade . But he was quite helpless at the end . The battlefield is a place for strength , not weakness . Don 't you agree ? The officers who commanded this train are dead ... the sergeant 's dead ... and I 'm a very tired man , Michaels ... worn right down to the bone . I 've got no time for whatever game it is you 're playing . I want the gunpowder from you and nothing more . Now lead me to it . No . Carry the conduit down to the terminal pole . - We 're running out of time , Ray . - We 're almost through here , General . All right . That 's it . Now close it up . A special power supply from Hoover Dam is hooked in , General . It should be enough to handle our power reversal . - We 'll run a test of the circuits . - Good . The timing is gonna be critical ... if we can separate Doug 's signal and send Machiavelli back in time . How long will it take you to test the circuits ? A few minutes . No more . I owe you an apology , Woody . Well , let 's say it was the strain of the moment . - Then you think I 'm right ? - No . But somebody 's got to make the decisions , and I respect you for doing it . The apology 's accepted . I 'll run the test and stand by for your signal . And I wish us luck . Amen to that . The powder is hidden by that screen of brush , and the wagon 's over there . An interesting thought , is it not ? Yankee , load this onto the wagon . Beware . He will outwit you . Now you 're faced with the commander 's decision - whether to sacrifice your friend to destroy a larger evil . All right , this has to be done , Tony . I 'm gonna get by you one way or the other . Now , you 'd better get out of here while you can . Put that down . I said put it down ! [ Hammer Clicking ] Excellent . Now you are both even . - What 's happened ? - He 's trying to kill us . You have the advantage . Kill him , and you can destroy the powder . That 's not gonna work this time , Machiavelli . You forget yourself . I am Machiavelli . You cannot kill me . Therefore , I 'm indestructible . No , we 're not going to kill you , Machiavelli . No . We 're going to tie you up and put you in that cave . One of the bloodiest battles of all time is about to take place ... and we are personally going to see to it that you miss it . I think not . You 've deprived me of the lieutenant 's aid ... but a good field commander always has alternatives . [ Laughs ] Stand back ! [ Man Shouting ] - [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Shouting ] Stand to your posts , everyone ! Stand to your posts ! They 're in the path of the explosion ! If that powder goes , they 'll be killed . ! - Switch them quick ! We 've only got seconds ! - It 'll be a miracle . Can 't you get them under control ? Stabilize them . Ann , refine your locator . I 'm doing the best I can , General . We 're getting an interfering impulse . We 've lost ' em . [ Shouting ] I 've got Doug and Tony again . [ Men Screaming ] Let 's try this way . Oriental . Sure is . Mongolian . Those were Mongols back there . If my memory serves me right ... this is the emblem of the great Khans . Genghis Khan ? [ Shouting ]

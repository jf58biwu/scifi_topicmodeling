 ( footsteps running ) What are you doing ? ! He had the Garner file . You were going to kill him . When I get finished , we 're going to take him to the car and make it look like an accident . No ! Your brother knows what we 're doing , Martin . He may have been taking that file to someone . Well , even if he does know , that 's all the more reason not to kill him . We 've got to find out who he 's contacted and what he 's told them . Adam ... Adam , I can make sure he cooperates . No . But he can be one of our tests . We 've had tests- - Garner and the rest of them . Do you think I 'd take a chance with my own brother if I wasn 't sure this time ? If it doesn 't work ? If it doesn 't work , we haven 't lost anything . He dies like the others . NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the Earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Michael Tolan ... William Smithers ... Katherine Justice ... Kent Smith ... and Michael Constantine as Martin Willard . ( car approaching ) NARRATOR : Willard Sanitarium- - a place of rest and help but for David Vincent , there will be a terrifying vision of the future waiting at the end of this peaceful road . ( door opens ) You stay away from him . You can tell Adam I 'll look after him . ( chuckles ) Well ... how goes the battle ? Any better ? Except for the headaches . Well ... we had to take out a lot of sawdust . There 's nothing to stop the marbles from running around . Squeeze . Other hand . Good . The headaches will get better , Ted . You and I are going to be kings of the hill . There 's a lot happening in this world , Ted . We 're going to lead the parade . Come see me later at the lab . Thank you , Martin . I 'm going back now . You can come with me . The housekeeper will look after him . ( door closes ) Hello . David Vincent to see Dr. Willard . Yes , sir . Come in . Hi , Ted . David . I 'm sorry I took so long to get here , but that letter of yours followed me around for a couple of weeks . My letter ? Yeah . Well ... come in . I ... I was just on my-my way over to the lab for a checkup . I 've-I 've had an accident , but we ... we can talk for a few minutes . I didn 't know you had an accident . How are you ? Well , I 'm-I 'm pulling out of it . It was just a bad fall . ( chuckles nervously ) You , uh , you 're-you 're an architect now . Hey , uh , are you sure you 're all right ? Oh , I 'm fine . I ... I wrote you . Yes . It sounded urgent . Yes , I-I-I did write you . I-I remember that . I know you-you-you 've been on my mind , but ... the accident has kind of ... kind of shaken me up . I-I-I was talking about you with Martin , my-my brother . Oh ... ( snaps fingers ) of course . Architect ... pavilion . Well , uh , would you be interested ? ( chuckling ) : Uh , I don 't know what you 're talking about . The pavilion ... the research center Martin needs for his work . Yeah ... Mr. Garner left the money for us to build it now . Isn 't that what I wrote you about ? Well , you didn 't say anything specific . Well , it 's , uh ... it 's Martin 's baby , really . Maybe that 's why I didn 't . He 's the one you have to meet . I shouldn 't really say anything at all until you see him . All right . We 'll do it now , right away . Fine . David ... I-I amglad to see you . ADAM : You sure you don 't want my help ? You 've got your own work to do . I 'll give Ted his checkup today . Having second thoughts , Dr. Willard ? Not about what I 've done . ( phone ringing ) Get it . Yes , Dr. Willard . Lab . Yes ? I see . Thank you very much . Janet is coming to the lab . Janet ? I don 't want her to run into Ted . How 'd she get in here ? What difference does that make ? Stop her . Janet ... Janet , this is a restricted area . You know that . I have a right to be here . It 's my money , or my father 's that 's paying for your work , isn 't it ? I know that , dear , but I can 't talk about it now . I 'm sorry . Neither can Ted . That 's obvious . I 've been to the house twice and both times , your housekeeper sent me away . Martin , I want to see him . That 's impossible . Why ? Because he 's ... not well enough . He can 't have visitors and he can 't leave the house . I 'm his fiancée . I-I have a right to see him . Something is wrong . Martin , he called me the night of the accident . He said that he wanted to see me . I waited and he didn 't come . What happened ? Oh , you 're the one . I 'm what ? Nothing . Please , go home now . You will see him soon . He 's all right . Can I believe that ? Yes . I 'll call you . All right . More hysterics , hmm ? Maybe we ought to let him see her . Not until I 'm sure Ted 's under control , but I did find out it was Janet he contacted . Now we 've got to make sure she doesn 't find out why . Ted ? Oh , Ted . Um , David , this is , this is Janet Garner my , uh , my fiancée . How do you do ? What are you doing out like this ? Martin said that you were too sick to leave the house . Well , he told me to come here . I 've got an appointment to see him . We , uh , we 've got to go in now . David has to meet Martin . Of course . Are you going to be working with Martin , too ? Uh , no . Ted and I were roommates in college . Janet , I 'm , I 'm sorry , but we have to go in . But I will see you now that you 're better ? Yes , I 'll , I 'll see you . Janet . David , we 've seen pictures of your work . We admire it very much , but I 'm afraid we 're not ready to commission an architect just yet . But I sent for David right before the accident . I see . Well , I hope you haven 't come on a wild-goose chase . Ted , why don 't you wait for me down in the lab ? I 'll be down in a few minutes . Good . I 'm , I 'm shakier than I thought . I 'll , uh , I 'll talk to you later , David . Adam Lane , David Vincent . Mr. Lane . How do you do ? Ted sent for Mr. Vincent , Adam . Adam is my right hand . He 's designed all the mechanical equipment I use . If you 'll excuse me just a moment , I 'd like to get Martin to sign some papers . Why don 't you make yourself comfortable , David ? After I give Ted his checkup , I 'll show you around . We 're doing some fascinating things here . Aren 't you going to be busy ? I 'll be glad to do it . They let me see exactly what they wanted me to see- - nothing else . Go on . I 'm listening . Ted heads up the psychiatric division , and his brother heads up the hospital division . It 's a surgical division . Are you sure this Adam Lane 's an alien ? Well , pretty sure . And they 've gotten to Ted . How it adds up , I don 't know . David , one of our subsidiaries , Hale Electronics services the sanitarium 's data processing equipment . I 'll get somebody down there , and I think I 'd better take a look myself . Good idea . I 'm at the Brownwood Motel . Are you all right ? Yeah . I 'm fine , thank you . I 'll see you later . Yes , it is the same Vincent . I 'll take care of it . Yes , sir . Behavior pattern one . Assuming full behavior control . ( engine starts ) ( tires screeching ) ( tires screeching ) Is Dr. Willard in ? Yes , sir . Well , come in , David Vincent . What 's the matter ? Things can 't be that bad this early in the morning . Will you bring us some coffee , please , Irma ? Never mind the coffee . Might need something stronger . What 's the matter ? Last night , someone tried to run me down in front of the motel . I 'll call Martin . Ted , I want answers from you . David , I 'm , I 'm sorry . I should never have brought you here . It 's about time you started leveling with me . What 's going on here ? Isn 't that why you wrote me ? Not a new pavilion . You need help . No , that 's , that 's wild . I called you because you 're an architect , because I needed you . Hospital designers are special . You could 've hired an expert . But I-I wanted you ! You 've got to believe that , David . I wanted you . Ted , I know what Adam Lane is . Your brother 's working with them . Why ? My brother ? No ! You know they 're here , don 't you ? I don 't know ! Who are you talking about ? David , just , just get out of here . What is it ? It 's just these headaches . Like Mr. Garner had . Ted , let me help you . No , I know what to do . Ted , I want to help . No ! I don 't want any help ! Now , please , get out of here ! I 'll be back . What do you want ? Mr. Vincent ? Yes . Mr. Scoville sent me . Sorry about snooping , but I went to the motel and got tired of waiting . I checked the car rental agency and tracked you down . How do you know Scoville ? I work for him . Albuquerque plant . David Vincent . Burt Newcomb . Scoville tell you what this is about ? Yeah . I can 't say I buy it , but he asked me to do a favor and I said okay . What 's the job ? You 're going to have to get into their files . My-my outfit services their machines . How hard it 's going to be depends on what you want . I have to know what kind of treatment was given to two men- - Dr. Ted Willard and Mr. Garner . Then check further to see if anybody else has received similar treatment recently . To use Ted , my brother ! Did you have another solution ? Any other solution ! Vincent knew about me . I didn 't know what he was doing , Martin . Don 't be so protective . It 's not what you think of as murder . Look , maybe we 'd better have an understanding . As long as I 'm in charge here ... You 're not in charge here , and you haven 't been since I came . When we started this thing , you told me we 'd be saving lives . Now , I know how strong you people are . You could kill us all in a minute . I know that . No , Martin , you 're making that unnecessary . We won 't have to kill your people ... not if they don 't oppose us . I want to know what I 'm doing this for- - to save lives or to give you murderers . You 're doing it because if we achieve control , first with machines and then without , nobody will have to be killed . That 's a beautiful thought , Martin , but first we have to get there . One man against millions that can be saved . JANET : The laboratory is out of bounds , Mr. Vincent . My father 's money may be financing Martin 's research , but that doesn 't give me the right to walk in there . You know what kind of experiments they 're doing ? There 's no secret about that . It 's behavior control . Martin has some new theory about treating mental illness . Through surgery ? I thought you came here to tell me something about Ted . I will . First tell me something . Did your father have his operation because he had an accident like Ted ? No . The operation was to relieve nerve pressure at the back of his neck . Was the operation a success ? Yes . At least , for a while . Then what ? He began to complain about pain at the back of his head . I thought it was just strain from getting back to work too soon . But Dad said he had so many things to clear up . He ... he was so concerned about business , his health , making his will . The will leaving the money for the new pavilion ? I hardly knew him . He kept saying there was something in his head , that they put something in his head . One night he grew so irrational , I called the sanitarium , and they came for him . And the second operation was a failure . Your father was operated on . So was Ted . And you say your father behaved strangely like someone you didn 't know- - the way Ted is behaving right now . Mr. Vincent , that may sound logical , but I 've known Martin and Ted for three years . Martin loves Ted as much as I do , and he would never do anything to hurt him . Will you please go ? Thank you . Thank you very much . Burt 's been in there a long time . Looks as though he can take care of himself . ( machine clacking ) ( machine stops ) What are you doing ? Just earning a day 's pay . Checking out your machines . Who told you to do that ? It 's in your service contract , sir . Every 90 days . Of course , if you 'd rather we didn 't ... Well , then , next time , call first . You bet . Back it around . ( closes car door ) ( tires screeching ) Thanks for the hand . Oh , don 't mention it . DAVID : Here , Ed . Can you make any sense out of that ? Willard and Garner had operations on the back of their necks . So did two others . Garner , Manfredi and Norris are dead . Ted Willard 's still alive . Well , sometime after the operation- - two , two and a half weeks- - they come back , are operated on again and they die . Did you have time to check any invoices ? Yeah , just barely . They bought some pretty sophisticated gear- - like somebody might use for ultrahigh frequency transmission . That do anything for you ? Let me tell you what some of our people are doing in the Syracuse plant . If you alter a brain pattern in an animal electronically , you change its behavior . Send a cat a signal- - an impulse , really- - to be afraid of a mouse , he 'll climb a wall to get away . Tell them to charge a tiger , they 'll do that , too . Behavior control . Martin ... What 's the matter , Ted ? David ... Somebody tried to kill him . How do you know ? He told me ... and I saw who did it . You what ? I mean I saw ... I mean I-I could picture it in a car out on the road . How much of the stuff had you had ? Not much . Martin , tell me the truth . I couldn 't have known what happened how it happened , but I did . You know why I could see it , don 't you ? I know you 're still sick , Ted . You imagined it . Martin , you 're lying to me . I think I was driving the car ... and I don 't know why . Martin ... you 've always helped me before . Help me now . Tell me the truth . Come on . Let 's get upstairs . You need some sleep . No , please , Martin , I 'm begging you . Tell me the truth ! Ted ... have I ever done anything to hurt you ? You 've been in an accident . Your mind is playing tricks on you . That 's all you can say ? Ted ... No , leave me alone . I 'll find my own help . Is that what you think ? That I tried to kill you ? I 'm not saying you knew what you were doing . But you said it was my car , so you must think I 'm working for these aliens . You could be , just as Janet 's father could 've been . There 's one man who can tell us for sure . Who ? DAVID : Ted , you asked me to come here because you wanted help . You had found out about the aliens . Just how is your brother involved ? TED : Martin isn 't involved in anything , I promise you . All right . There 's no reason to protect him , then . You can help me check it out . David , he 's my brother . I can 't do anything to hurt him . Ted , will you listen to me ? MARTIN : No , you listen , Vincent ! Ted is sick and you 're making him worse . Now you get out or I 'll throw you out . How about it , Ted ? Will you help me ? He 's my brother , David . You 're my brother . There 's no doubt about it . It was Ted . It 'd take the police two minutes to match the fender of his car with the sign he hit . Now , Janet , do you think he 'll stand any more chance than your father ? It 's not the same . Martin would never do anything to hurt his brother . Martin won 't have anything to say about what happens to Ted . Six weeks ago , your father was killed because they had what they wanted from him- - the money for the new pavilion . Now , who knows what they want from Ted or how long they 'll let him live . Janet , you couldn 't do anything to save your father but you can save Ted . Will you help me ? What do you want me to do ? Ms. Garner ... we all know how much your father meant to you . I would like to know why you want this done . Maybe because he did mean a lot to me . Mr. Braemer , I think I 've complied with all the rules . Now will you do it ? As coroner , I have a right to refuse a request for a postmortem if you don 't give me a valid reason . I found it , Mr. Braemer . The death certificate , yes . Everything seems to be in order . You can see Dr. Martin Willard 's signature . Please don 't try to make me change my mind . I 'm the only surviving kin . If I just wanted to have my father 's body removed , I 'd have the right , and if you try to deny my request , that 's exactly what I 'll do . I 'll have my father 's body removed and have the postmortem performed elsewhere . Very well . If you 'll step into my office , we 'll sign the necessary papers . Adam Lane , please . A postmortem . Why ? I don 't know . Maybe her father said something to her before he died . No ... No , it 's Vincent who 's made her do this . We can stop that postmortem . She 's already signed the papers . They won 't have any reason to go through with it if Janet suddenly dies . No more killing . Your future and your brother 's depend on stopping that postmortem . There 's only one person who can get to her . Maybe you didn 't hear me . I said no more killing . Your brother 's behavior is programmed . He 'll do exactly what we want . I 'm warning you , if you go ahead with this , I 'll go to the police . Now , there 's one way for you to stop me : that 's to kill me . That would be the end of this project . You know that . All right , Martin . We 'll find another way to do it . OPERATOR : Brownwood Motel . Uh ... David Vincent , please . One moment , please . VINCENT : Hello . David , Ted . I , um ... I 've given it some thought . I want to help . Good , good . Well , listen , I 'll meet you at the lab . How soon ? Ted ? Ted , what 's the matter ? Ted ? Behavior pattern one . Active control track . Subject : Ted Willard . ( brief rhythmic thrumming ) ( hard rhythmic thrumming ) ( piano concerto playing ) ( concerto mixes with thrumming ) ( concerto reverberates under thrumming ) ( phone ringing ) Hello ? ( concerto reverberating ) JANET : Hello ? Who is this ? ( concerto plays dissonantly ) JANET : Who is this ? ( sets receiver down ) ADAM : Present behavior is dictated by your past relationship to Janet . Nothing must arouse her suspicion . You know the way , Ted . Choose a time when no one will see you enter . The rest is up to you . Now , remember , if she lives , if she carries out her plan , your brother will be destroyed . You can 't afford to let her live , can you ? Remember that- - you can 't afford to let her live . It 's in your hands , Ted . ( doorbell chimes ) Ted ! Oh , are you all right ? Guilt complexes up to here . Guilt ? For neglecting you . Come . Talk to me about the weather the stock market , baseball scores , anything . Ted , I 've missed you . Ted ... something 's wrong . No , no , no . Just , just feeling a little restless . You have a cigarette ? Ted , I know what 's been going on- - David told me . I should be grateful to him . We 'll help you . You don 't have anything to worry about . We 'll stop them . Yes . ( gagging ) Ted ! When you 've finished , report immediately . Immediately . How soon will this be ready ? NURSE : Right away , sir . What were you doing in there ? I was checking some of our equipment . We just checked it on Tuesday . Well , some of my people are coming next week . They 'll want to check our progress . What were you doing in there ? What are you so suspicious about ? I told you I was checking some of our equipment . You 've been transmitting . That 's Ted 's tape- - it 's on absolute control . Get away from there . You went ahead with it . You used Ted . I 'm sorry , Martin . It had to be done . Now , you can 't change anything . It 's over . Your brother did kill her ? That 's what you 're going to tell the police ? Your brother 's work for us is done . I don 't think you 'll try that again . Ted ... Just let him come out of it . ( groans ) My neck ... Janet ... Oh , Janet , darling ! Do you remember what you were trying to do , Ted ? Yes . Let me up . JANET : No , Ted . ( sighs ) The pressure 's gone . They must have put a device in the back of your head when you had that surgery . It was destroyed when you fell . You knew ? Behavior control . It didn 't work with Janet 's father or the others , so they died . But it worked with you . I wasn 't sure . I was afraid to be sure . Because of Martin ? I thought they were making him do this , that maybe you could save him . I 'm going to the lab . Now , wait a minute . You could use help . Are you coming ? Call Burt Newcomb at this number . Tell him to send help . Let 's go . I have a plan . Well , this is an unexpected bonus . But if he tried to stop you , why didn 't you get rid of him ? I only had orders to kill Janet . Congratulations , Martin . You did a fine job on me . What job , Ted ? The operation . You were programmed to forget all about the operation . You know what I think ? I think you 're lying ; the control failed . Give me the gun , Ted . No , Martin . MARTIN : Give it to me , and then you can go . I 'll take care of this . The way you 've always taken care of everything ? Yes . Making sure that nothing would ever hurt me ? I 've tried . By turning me into a murderer ? Ted , you don 't understand what 's happening here . Don 't , Martin ! I 've listened to you all my life ... trusted you ... but don 't tell me any more . Ted ... David knows . He knows how superior they are . They 're going to take over the Earth , Ted . We don 't stand a chance unless we cooperate . They 'll wipe us out- - every one of us . But ... if we can get to the key men of the world and control them , then there won 't be any resistance . We 'll all survive . As their slaves . Like I was ? Ted , they 're going to win . Now , you won 't shoot . Ted ... come with us . Please , Ted . You 've got to come with us . Ted , give me the gun . No . Martin ! Stop ! Stay there ! ( tires screeching ) TED : It 's over , Martin . ( groaning ) I ... I could 've ... saved you from them . By doing what you did ? Adam ... he wan ... he wanted to kill you . MARTIN : I had to do that . I couldn 't ... let him ... I ... I just ... wanted to help you , Ted . That 's all I wanted . Just ... to help ... you . Do the police want to see him ? DAVID : No . The , uh , police are out looking for Adam Lane . They say when they find him , they 'll be able to solve Martin 's murder . We gave them a description of Lane , plus an eyewitness account of what happened , and then I wished the police a lot of luck finding him . Thank you very much . Did you , uh , did you tell them what was going on here ? They didn 't ask . How do you feel ? Like being a doctor again . I won 't have those headaches anymore . And there 's still a pavilion to build . And research to be done . We 've got the best equipment in the world if it 's used in the right way- - to help people . Say , buddy , you 've , uh ... you 've come a long way to help me . I want to thank you . Don 't mention it . If it 'll be any help , I 'll send a list of people who specialize in building hospitals . All right ? Okay . So long . Bye . So long . Good-bye .

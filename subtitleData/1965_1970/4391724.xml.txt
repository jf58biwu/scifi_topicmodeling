 Still no response , sir . Keep it open . I don 't like this . Nothing since the first check-in . Scott and Sulu should 've contacted us half an hour ago . They may have nothing to report . Our sensors indicate no life forms except our landing party . Both those men are well aware of landing-party procedure . They should 've checked in with us by now . Contact established , captain . - Jackson to Enterprise . - Enterprise . Kirk here . - One to beam up , Enterprise . - One ? - Jackson , where are Scott and Sulu ? - I 'm ready to beam up , sir . - Jackson ! - I 'm sorry , I can 't clear it , captain . Notify Transporter Room to prepare to beam up one member of the landing party . Then have Dr. McCoy report to me in the Transporter Room , on the double . - Ready , sir . - Energise . - What 's on , Jim ? - Trouble . Jackson , where are the others ? The man is dead . Captain Kirk , can you hear me ? There is a curse on your ship . Leave this place or you will all die ! Space , the final frontier . These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise . Its five-year mission : To explore strange new worlds , to seek out new life and new civilisations , to boldly go where no man has gone before . Captain 's Log : Stardate 3018.2 . Crewman Jackson is dead , and there are no apparent physical causes . Mr. Scott and Mr. Sulu are still out of touch on the planet below . Leaving Assistant Chief Engineer DeSalle in command of the Enterprise , I 'm beaming down to the planet 's surface to find my two missing crewmen and discover what killed Jackson . Odd . Our probe data didn 't indicate fog . No cloud formations , no bodies of water , no changes in surface temperature . Under these conditions , fog is highly unlikely , captain . According to our transporter coordinates , this is the exact location from which Jackson was beamed up to the ship . - Readings , Mr. Spock ? - No indications of ... A moment . Picking up life form readings : 24 degrees mark 7 . Range 137.16 metres . - Multiple readings , captain . - Scott and Sulu ? - Kirk to Enterprise . - Enterprise , Lieutenant Uhura here . What are the ship 's sensors reading now , lieutenant ? Report , mister . I am only picking up physical impulses from the three of them . As far as the instruments can make out there is nothing else down there that 's alive . Relay , lieutenant . Captain , we are only registering on you . Captain . Captain Kirk ! Lieutenant , can you hear me ? Whatever this stuff is , it 's getting thicker . Do you suppose it has anything to do with the interference ? No . There has to be some explanation for the fact the ship 's sensors can 't register anything but us , while we 're picking up readings for multiple life forms . - Are they still there , Spock ? - No change , captain . Standby alert . Listen . - What do you think that ... - Quiet . Captain Kirk . Captain Kirk . - Who are you ? - Go back . Remember the curse Winds shall rise And the fog descend So leave here , all Or meet your end ! Spock , comment . Very bad poetry , captain . A more useful comment , Mr. Spock . What we 've just seen is not real . That 's useful . However , on Azimuth 24 , at just over 100 metres , there are definitely life forms . Erratic , confused but definitely registering . - That 's where we go . That was a pretty real illusion , Mr. Spock . Jim . This is the source of the life form readings , captain . They 're inside somewhere . Kirk to Enterprise . Enterprise , come in . Isn 't that how we lost contact with the first landing party ? What about it , Spock ? Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference ? I would say not , captain . There 's no indication of anything that would cause such interference . And it doesn 't pick up on our ship 's sensors . Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside . It could be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan . Then it would affect Spock 's tricorder too , wouldn 't it ? Would it ? I wonder . Three witches what appears to be a castle , and a black cat . If we weren 't missing two officers , and a third one dead , I 'd say someone was playing an elaborate trick-or-treat on us . - Trick-or-treat , captain ? - Yes , Mr. Spock . You 'd be a natural . I 'll explain it to you one day . - Shall we have a look around ? - That would seem to be in order . Bones . Spock . They 're gone , Mr. DeSalle . The captain and the others . Simply stopped registering . Check for malfunctions . - I did , sir , as soon as it happened . - Mr. DeSalle that 's exactly what happened to Mr. Scott and his party . - They just disappeared . - Nobody just disappears . They may have encountered a magnetic field or some other obstruction . Mr. Chekov , recalibrate your sensors . - If you need help ... - I can do it , sir . I 'm not that green . Lieutenant Uhura , continue your efforts to break through that static interference . Aye , aye , sir . We know they 're down there . I want them found . - Straight ahead , Mr. Spock ? - The readings would so indicate . Dust , cobwebs . Halloween is right . Spock are you all right ? - Yes . I am undamaged , captain . Bones . Doc . You were saying something about trick-or-treat . Dungeons curses . Skeletons and iron maidens . They 're all Earth manifestations . - Why ? - I do not know , captain . But these things do exist . They are real . Could this be an Earth parallel development of some sort ? None of this parallels any human development . It 's more like a human nightmare . - As if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an instinctive level . Ghost stories , ogres , demons . The whole ... Scotty , Sulu . Scotty put down the phaser . They appear to be drugged , captain . Look at their eyes . They hardly blink at all . Neither did Jackson , just before he collapsed . These two are alive . Scotty , do you hear me ? Sulu , do you know who I am ? What 's happened to you ? I think they 're going to release us . Stop ! Whoever you are you 've proven your skill at creating illusions . Now I want to know why , and what you 've done to my men . Where did your race get this ridiculous predilection for resistance ? You examine any object , you question everything . Is it not enough to accept what is ? Not when one of my men is dead because of it , - and two others turned into mindless ... - Not mindless . These two are merely controlled , Captain Kirk . Yes , we know who you are . All of you . Don 't we , my precious ? Who are you ? Why did you bring us here ? My name is Korob . And as for bringing you here it was you who quite contrarily insisted upon coming . - You were warned to stay away . - But why ? For what reason ? Why all the mumbo jumbo ? Mumbo jumbo ? No , I assure you it was not that , captain . Mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before . There never have been any life forms on Pyris Vll . It is of no importance that we are not native to this planet . I 'm told I 've been an inattentive host , gentlemen . You will join me for something to refresh yourselves ? - That cat . - That cat . There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their familiars . Familiars ? Demons in animal forms , sent by Satan to serve the wizard . Superstition . I do not create the legend , captain . I merely report it . You are the different one , Mr. Spock . You do not think like the others . There are no colours to your patterns of logic . There 's only black and white . You see all this around you and yet you do not believe . - He doesn 't know about trick-or-treat . I do not understand that reference . Therefore it also is of no importance . Gentlemen , I can be most hospitable . - Ingenious . - Do be seated . - We 're not hungry . - But I insist . All right , Korob . What do you want from us ? For the moment , merely that you eat and enjoy yourselves . Doctor , do try the wine . You 'll find it excellent . You 'll find us most uncooperative unless you start explaining yourself . Hopefully I can change that attitude . - These look real . - They are , I assure you . Diamonds , rubies , emeralds , sapphires . All the crystalline forms you cherish above all things . A fortune of them for each of you , if you will leave here without further enquiry . We could manufacture a ton of these on our ship for you . - They mean nothing to us . - Valueless ? I don 't understand . I read ... Whatever it is you read , you read it wrong . As for leaving , we 'll leave when we 're ready . You are most unpredictable . Perhaps I have made a small mistake . Nevertheless , you have passed the tests . - Tests ? - Yes . Our analysis of you may have been , in some small way , in error but you were warned to stay away , and yet you came to save your comrades . That proves loyalty . Your bravery was tested , and you did not frighten . And despite my failure with these bright baubles , I perceive you cannot be bribed . In many ways , you are quite admirable . Quite right . Go at once , yes . Gentlemen , my colleague , Sylvia . Dr. McCoy , Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk . You wanted to know what we did to your men . Actually , it 's a simple matter for us to probe the minds of creatures like yourself . Mind-probing . Hypnosis ? You like to think of yourselves as complex creatures , but you 're flawed . One gains admittance to your minds through many levels . You have too many to keep track of yourselves . There are unguarded entrances to any human mind . Telepathy ? Not entirely , no . Telepathy doesn 't imply control and I assure you that I have full control of your friends . Don 't move . Cover them . Now , I want the rest of our weapons and our equipment . - I want some answers . - Put that weapon down . Captain , it seems so foolish of you to insist on demonstrations . In the mythology of your race , this is called " sympathetic magic " . Jackson , the crew member who returned to the ship . You wondered what killed him . I made an image of him . In the essence of my thoughts , the image was Jackson . And when I killed the image and knew that it was dead he died . You can 't think a man to death . Your communicator . Now signal your ship . Don 't . Sylvia , don 't ! Kirk to Enterprise , come in . Come in . - Enterprise , I 'm Captain Kirk . Come in . - Captain . Are you all right ? Where are you ? Are the others all right , sir ? Never mind about us . What 's happening up there ? The temperature , sir . It keeps rising . Reading , mister . It 's up 60 degrees in the past 30 seconds . We 're burning up , sir . DeSalle channel bypass power into your heat dissipation units . I 've already done it , captain . It had no effect . - We 're cooking up here . - All right . I 'll handle it down here . Kirk out . You 've won . You can relax now , captain . Your ship is safe . The temperature is almost back to normal dropping down fast . Lieutenant , try to raise the captain again . Enterprise to Captain Kirk . Come in , please . Enterprise to Captain Kirk . Acknowledge . We 've lost him again , Mr. DeSalle . Captain , you 've seen something of our science , now tell us about yours . You seem to be singing a different tune . I 'd rather know more about yours . You call it " magic , " you call it " science " . It seems to be unrelated to both of them . - What would you name it , captain ? - I wouldn 't attempt to name it . But you seem to do with your mind what we do with tools . You alter matter , move it about by telekinesis . - Yes , we can change the molecular ... - Korob , you talk too much ! You kept Scott and Sulu as catspaws to lure us down here . - How 'd you know we 'd come ? - We didn 't have to know . - They knew . - Enough of this . You will tell us what we want to know . It 's too late for threats . You let me contact the ship . How long do you think it will be before a search party arrives ? Some time , captain . Quite some time . There will be no search party , Captain Kirk . An impenetrable force field around your ship , captain . It will not hinder orbit , but your people are prisoners within it . It 's some kind of a force field , sir . But not like any other I 've heard of before . It 's not coming from anywhere it 's simply all around us . I would advise you to cooperate , captain . Forcible extraction of the information we wish from you is not complicated , but it is extremely painful . And it has a certain - draining effect . - We have nothing to discuss . Take them to their cell . Wait . The doctor will stay . Your turn will be next , captain . It makes little difference . Take them out of here . Wavelength analysis , Mr. Chekov ? It will not analyse , sir . All right . But it 's there , and it 's real . If it 's real , it can be affected . Engineering , standby to divert all power systems to the outer hull . Prepare impulse engines for generation of maximum heat directed as ordered . Maybe we can 't break it , but I 'll bet you credits to navy beans we can put a dent in it . How long has it been ? - 22 minutes , 17 seconds . - Thanks . I wonder what they 're doing to Doc . I 'm sure we 'll find out shortly . Jim all these things that we 've seen to an Earthman like yourself they must seem quite familiar . Familiar . Startling not rational . - Precisely . I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial subconscious . - The universal myths , symbols . - Ghosts , witches , you mean ? And dungeons , and castles , and black cats . They all belong to the twilight world of consciousness . - They tried to tap our conscious mind . - And they missed . They reach basically only the subconscious . Korob seemed quite puzzled by your reaction to the environment he had provided . He expected me to react as though it were all normal . He admitted they weren 't native to this planet . And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most unlikely , for any life form we 've met in this galaxy . They refer to us as " creatures " ... as though we were some species they were unfamiliar with . If we 're creatures ... I wonder what they 're really like ? Evidently something totally alien in all respect . Agreed . Totally alien . I don 't like hostile strangers showing such an acute interest in our galaxy , our world , Spock . Not at all like friendly visitors . We 're going to have to stop them . Cold . But at the moment ... I too , am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action . Bones . Doc . You forget what we were sent here for . I forget nothing . I 'm not a puppet , Korob , like you . - You 're a traitor ! - You are a fool ! We have nothing like this . And I like it . To touch , to feel , to understand the idea of luxury . I like it and I don 't intend to leave it . - We have a duty to the Old Ones . - What do they know of sensations ! - This is a new world . - You 're cruel . You torture our specimens . And that too , is a new sensation . I find it stimulating . You 're wrong ! You 're discarding everything we live by . I live by my own decisions . You 're a weak fool , Korob . - I have the power . - But you 're afraid to use it . Don 't threaten me . I can squash you , and that would be an interesting sensation , yes . I find I like these new sensations . Don 't try to push me . Captain it 's time for our talk . Korob , leave us alone and take these men with you . This is not ended , Sylvia . But it may end soon , old man . What now ? Do you wave your magic wand and destroy my mind too ? There 's no real damage to the mind , Captain . - Simply a drain of knowledge and will . - You don 't call that damage ? Why should I ? You 'd know if you had compassion . A woman should have compassion . - But I forget you 're not a woman . - But you 're mistaken , Captain . I am a woman now . I come from a world without sensation as you and I now know it . It excites me . I want more . You seem to need us . Why ? Because you have knowledge which I lack . But were our abilities put together ... Tell me about power , captain . How does it feel ? What about Korob ? He is a fool . I 'll do without him . But you why do I find you different ? Why would it be so difficult to dispose of you ? Why don 't you simply probe my mind and get what you want ? No . Not that , not for you . What I want is is a joining . My mind to yours , willingly . Think of the secrets you could learn , think of the power that would be yours . Anything you can imagine , I can give you . You 're very persuasive . What happens if I go along ? Then everything would be ours together . I 've never conceived of the idea of togetherness before . It excites me . You excite me . Why ? For the same reasons you excite me . You 're a very beautiful woman . You find me beautiful . But I can be many women . You like what you see ? Or do you prefer me as I was ? You have a knack for giving me difficult choices . You have nothing like that where you come from ? Nothing . Your people , when they come here ... They 're like feathers in the wind , without the transmuter . - The transmuter ? - The source . You will learn . I will teach you later . Then it 's a device . You do use tools . It gives only form . You are teaching me substance . You haven 't changed your mind . You won 't return home . My home is here with you . A billion worlds of sensation to pick and choose . You are using me ! You hold me in your arms , and there is no fire in your mind ! You 're trying to deceive me . It 's here , like words on a page ! - You were using me . - Why not ? You 've been using me and my crew . You will be swept away . You , your men , your ship , your worlds ! - I don 't see any change . - It 's there , lieutenant . It was that electrical field we set up , Mr. DeSalle . That dent you wanted . It 's not much , but it is a start . Keep it up , Mr. Chekov . Channel the entire output of reactors one , two and three , into the relay stations . Whatever it is , it 's starting to weaken . I have released the model of your ship from the crystal . Although they would have freed themselves soon . It is difficult to control so many things in so little time . Here you must go before she finds the weapon is missing . - I 'm not leaving without my men . - They 're not your men anymore . They belong to Sylvia . I can no longer control them or her . She 's irrational . It 's the strain of adopting to your form . The insatiable desire for sensation and experience . She 's a great danger . And it was not necessary . We could have entered your galaxy in peace . - You came in a ship ? - We used a transmuter . Transmuter . Yes , she mentioned that . There 's no time to explain now . She means to destroy us all . There may still be a chance . Quickly . Come . Fascinating . - Why a cat ? - Racial memories . The cat is the most ruthless , most terrifying of animals . As far back as the sabre-toothed tiger . I think I can stop her . You 'd better let us . It 's out of energy . She must have drained it . We could 've jumped Scott and Sulu any time , if we 'd known . - No way out . - That 's my problem . She 's one of my kind . Come quickly . - You think you can make it ? - Ready when you are , captain . Get ready . No ! Get back ! Get back ! Get back ! - Korob , the door won 't last . - Get back ! Go . Go ! Quickly , captain . Korob seemed to think this was important . He said something about a transmuter . Captain , a bit more alacrity , if you please . Captain . Doc . Jim ! - At least we found them . - Fortuitous , captain . And now that we have them all together ? A most unpleasant situation , captain . If only your phaser had some power . Maybe we do . Sylvia I have the transmuter . It 's mine now . You 're very clever , captain . More so than I 'd imagined . Clever , resourceful , - and handsome . - Don 't let her touch the wand , captain . Jim ! - Don 't you get tired of these games ? - I 've never played games . Give it to me . I wasn 't sure before , but I am now . This is the source of your power , the transmuter . No , not the source . It 's merely an amplifier , a director . The mind is the source . Mine is simple . But yours has the key . - But you don 't know how to use it . - I catch on quickly . It 's not too late , Captain James Kirk . Come with me . - I 'll teach you , you 'll teach me . - Why ? Do your people have nothing of their own ? Is that why you need us ? We need your dreams , your ambition . With them I can build . - Give me the transmuter . - No . You fool ! Don 't you know what you 're giving up ? Everything that your species finds desirable . Look at me ! I am a woman . I am all women ! I don 't know what you are , but you 're not a woman . You 've tortured my men and taken their minds from them . You ask for love and return pain instead . Korob was wrong . I didn 't destroy all your weapons . Give me the transmuter . Give it to me ! - What happened , Jim ? - That 'll take some explaining , Bones . - Everything 's vanished . - Not everything . Korob and Sylvia as they really are . Their forms were an illusion , just like the castle and everything else . Only the power-pack gave them reality . Fascinating . A life form totally alien to our galaxy . If we could preserve and study this . Too late . All of this , just an illusion . No illusion . Jackson is dead . Kirk to Enterprise . Come in . - Standing by , captain . - Five to beam up .

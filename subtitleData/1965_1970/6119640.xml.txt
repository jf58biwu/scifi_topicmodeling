 - Good evening , Sergeant . - Good evening , Dr Hassler . - File 7842 . - Authority , please . Thank you . Your pen , Dr Hassler . Sorry , Sergeant . Oh , well . Now my plan is ruined . See , this is not a pen at all , it 's a secret camera . Well , better luck next time , Doctor . Vault nine . Thank you , Sergeant . Now , we shall see . My mistake . You were right . I 'm sorry . That 's all right , Doctor . All right . - Cigar ? - That 's premature . You haven 't won yet . - Do you wanna bet ? - Yeah . Three thousand million pounds . - All right ? - Everything 's fine . One minute to go . Last as usual . He 's only got a hundred yards to walk . Security , Lisa . Scrambling operative . Gentlemen . Gentlemen , please . The 67th meeting of the European Space Exploration Council is now in session . This is a momentous occasion for our organization . Sun Probe One was an unqualified success . We had some spectacular results . However , this meeting is called to consider one single result , startling in its implications . Dr John Kane , the project director . Gentlemen , an unmanned satellite is naturally limited in the transmission of information . Part of the sun probe 's equipment was a cine camera set to take one picture a minute for the duration of the flight . Roll the film , please . The far side of the sun , over 100 million miles from Earth , hidden from the eyes of radio telescopes by the sun itself . At this point , a strange thing happened . The gyro mechanisms aboard were influenced by another magnetic field and the capsule slowly started to rotate . If you watch your screens carefully , you 'll see that the cine camera was panned off the sun towards the force that was attracting it . That force , gentlemen , was the gravitational pull of another planet . I 'll hold the film to show you the first complete photographic evidence of a new planet . Hold and zoom . A new planet in our solar system . Thank you . Photographic evidence is only part of the story . Instruments aboard the capsule report it is in the same orbit as Earth , but directly on the opposite side of the sun . Orbital speed precisely the same as ours is the reason it has remained undetected . What information do we have from there systems on board ? Not enough . Which brings me to the purpose of this meeting - a proposal from the chair that we should mount a manned flight to the new planet . Lisa , book me a scrambled satellite call to NASA headquarters at the end of this meeting , please . - It 's already in hand , David . - How come ? - Instructions from Jason Webb . - Oh . Thanks . Well , Jason , how much is it gonna cost us this time ? - A point of order , Mr Chairman . - Another one ? Mr Chairman will agree , will he not , that all delegates are entitled to share in EUROSEC information . Correct . Then perhaps the chairman will share with us his estimate of the cost of this manned expedition . A realistic estimate , gentlemen - three thousand million pounds sterling . Mr Chairman , I 'm sure I 'm speaking for the whole of the community when I say that such a sum is out of the question . Trust a German to louse it up ! They lecture us on penny-pinching economics . The French are only too glad to agree with them . The rest of the community goes whichever way the wind blows . America 's our only hope . If they contribute , the rest might follow . Face it , Jason , we 've had it . Had what ? This is only a temporary setback . Did you see Poulson 's face when you pitched the price ? - No , I didn 't . - I did . And he 's not gonna buy it . - He 'll buy it . - For God 's sake . - Yes ? - David Poulson on the internal . Are you free to see him ? - Send him right up . - Yes , sir . You 're gonna sit there and watch me take a man for one billion dollars . The words of an egotistical megalomaniac . Maniac ? Remind me to be as charitable to you when one of your rockets blows up on the pad . Hadn 't you better attend to that cardiac warning ? Just a minute . I 'll make a deal with you . You stick to the science . - Let me handle the politics . - I 'll accept that deal . I 'll stick to the science if you handle the politics . Hello , John . Hi , Jason . Hello , David . - Scotch ? - Thanks , don 't mind if I do . Straight . All right . Now , why don 't you give it to me - straight ? Well , as you know , the United States has always cooperated with EUROSEC . - But in this case , we feel ... - I said straight ! OK , Jason . It 's no go . We discover a new planet in our own solar system , with military and scientific implications beyond comprehension . We ask our friends for a few dollars and it 's " no go " . - One billion dollars , Jason . - Cheap at twice the price . - Are you sure about this ? - Yes . Give it to Jason tonight . Delay could be dangerous . No , thanks . - You don 't want anyone else to get there . - How could they ? We have sole access to the information . Who else would know the planet existed ? You know perfectly well that we have a security leak . Well , we all have our problems . I see . I get the message . Look , I know how you feel about this project , Jason . But the answer is no . - I 'm sorry . I really am . - So am I. Miss Kirby ! I 'm going home now . Tell Neuman and Lisa I want to see them at 7 : 30 . Yes , Mr Webb . Oh , and John Kane asked me to give you this . Come in . I want a rundown on the current security position . - Defensively ? - Hm . We 've housed all findings and visual data from Sun Probe One in vault two . - Access ? - Restricted . - To whom ? - Yourself , John Kane and Mark . And offensively ? I 've reported the near certainty of a security leak . And so ? We picked up radio signals this morning . And got a bearing . Why not a fix ? Listen , that information is coded and radioed out in a two-second transmission . Hm . And there are 86,400 seconds in a day . All right . You made your point . - But when are you gonna nail him ? - What ? When are you going to nail him ? - It depends how much rope we give him . - All right . Lisa , that access restriction must be widened . - To whom ? - Hassler . Dr Hassler . You 're serving up information on a plate to our prime suspect ? That 's my responsibility . Your responsibility is this - if he shows his hand , I don 't want an arrest . Understood ? Understood . - Has any information been transmitted ? - He wasn 't broadcasting record requests . So the existence of a new planet could be known outside Europe and the States . I 'm afraid so . Preparations for a manned flight could be under way by somebody else . Don 't panic . It would take some time . We 'd have to check your information , examine Hassler 's body , see the transmissions you monitored , check the manufacturing origins of his photographic equipment . Arrange all that for Mr Poulson immediately . - And put John Kane in the picture . - Right . Could I have a look at the photographic equipment ? Sure . Does our side have anything like this ? We have now . Oh , Mark . Give that back to Kane , will you ? Tell him I accept his apologies . Right . So ... you 're convinced now there has been a leak ? - Yes . And I 'm left with no choice . - I agree . It 'll be up to you to persuade the rest of the community . But you 'd be prepared to recommend that the United States should contribute one billion dollars to a manned flight conducted by EUROSEC ? - Yes . Full information sharing . - Guaranteed . By you ? What else do you suggest ? Putting an American astronaut on the team . - Who ? - I 've already called Cape Kennedy . They suggested our most experienced . 50 days of space flight , two manned projects to Mars ... Glenn Ross ? The passenger from NASA flight 155 will arrive at gate seven . Thank you . Hold it , Mrs Ross . Thank you , Colonel . - I 'm Jason Webb . Welcome to EUROSEC . - Glenn Ross . My wife Sharon . - How do you do ? - Hello . - This is Lisa Hartmann , security . - How do you do ? - Hello . - Miss Hartmann . Dr John Kane , project director . Hello . Delighted to meet you . Paulo Landi , public relations . He 'll be looking after both of you . - How do you do , Mrs Ross ? - Hello . I 'll have a Scotch , please . - What 's on your mind ? - I 've been thinking , John . About the second astronaut to accompany Ross . Well , Borgner is the obvious choice . Or Mitchell . - If we want just an astronaut , I agree . - But ? It occurs to me we need someone more flexible . - Well , they 're trained to ... - I mean in terms of knowledge . Someone who could take full advantage of any findings on the new planet , however bizarre and unusual they happen to be . You mean an astrophysicist ? - Me ? - The idea doesn 't appeal to you ? - You must be joking . - It 'll grow on you . Well , there she is . Fourth gantry . We 've been developing a lift body for controlled landings . If analysis confirms an atmosphere on the new planet , we use that as the last stage . Without seeming too eager , when does training start ? Tomorrow . I can hardly wait . 400 . 400 . 450 . 500 . 600 . 650 . 700 . 700 . - Fire retros . - Hold it . - 750 . - Jason ! - 800 ! - What are you trying to do ? Kill him ? 800 . 850 . - Now ! - Retros ! - Are you OK , John ? - OK . Yes , I 'm OK . Hi . Didn 't know you 'd be back . You 're late . We ... drove into Lisbon to see the cathedral and then stopped over for dinner . Oh ! I could sleep for a week . - I had my first medical today . - Did you ? How did it go ? Doctors say everything 's all right as usual . Good . Everything 's all right . We 're not starting that one again , are we ? Look , face it , Glenn . It 's your job . You 're up in space hundreds of days . You 're subjected to radiation effects . That 's why we can 't have children . - The doctors say different . - They 're employed by politicians . Do you really think they 'd tell even you the truth ? Great publicity . America 's top astronaut - sterile . Your doctors don 't work for politicians so it can 't be you . For God 's sakes , I 'm not about to go through this again . The brutal truth of the matter is that you went up there a man , but you came back less than a man . Maybe this is why we 're not having kids , huh ? If you have anything to say , you better say it now . Is that how you prove your virility ? It really was the only way of attracting your attention . - You look like a man with problems . - I 'll tell you about ' em someday . Thank you . Would Mr Edwards please contact reception ? - We don 't often see you at administration . - Jason wants to see me . How is the training going ? It 's tough for me , but it 's hell for John . It 's a crash course in space preparation . Glenn , there is something I shouldn 't tell you . - What 's that ? - I know why Jason wants to see you . - Why ? - He plans to put the launch date forward . - Forward ? - Mm-hm . - Well , we 'll see about that . - Good luck , Glenn . - Lisa . - Hm ? Thanks for the warning . I 'm forwarding the launching date four weeks . - You 're pushing too hard , Jason . - You don 't understand . In Germany , budgetary troubles . In France , political troubles . Somebody will suggest withdrawing from the project any day . You 're an administrator . You know when a rocket 's ready , but not a man . Kane isn 't . I know more about human nature than anybody else at EUROSEC . That 's why I 'm in this office . And I 'm telling you , Kane will make it . And I 'm telling you he won 't . - Where do we go from here ? - There are other American astronauts . That 's right . You 'd be right back to zero again . Nevertheless , I am informing you officially that the launching date will be brought forward ... two weeks . Two weeks . - Now ? - Now . My instincts tell me there 's a little bit of transportation around here somewhere . - Don 't the rules say we walk ? - Sure . - What 's it like up there ? - Where ? There . Lonely . How lonely ? Same as down here . No different . You mean you 've got to have someone with you down here up there ? It 's got to be the right person , though , or it makes no difference . No difference . - Home again . - Yeah . This is the part we have to make look good . We 're back uncomfortably early . - I could grow attached to them . - That 's the idea . Now you can be hooked up to the heart , lung and kidney machine during flight . With sedation you will sleep for three weeks there ... and three weeks back . That part I 'm looking forward to .

Liftoff . - Well , she flies . - Course she bloody well flies . - See you in three weeks . - Let 's hope the alarm clock goes off . It better . You made it . Good morning . Bang on target . Clouds . There are clouds , Glenn . So there is an atmosphere . All right . Preliminary orbit 34,000 miles from planet 's surface as planned , right ? Right . OK , two orbits to mark out electronic survey , then we decide ... to land or not to land . Well , let 's have it . Mass and gravitational pull similar to Earth . There 's an atmosphere . Oxygen present . - Suitable landing site ? - Established . Seascape and vegetation . So far no sign of life . All right , mate . What 's the next move ? Well , like you said - to land or not to land . This is one we can 't put through the computer . What do you think ? I think , on the result of the survey , we don 't have a choice . - You ? - I 'm for go . Let 's go , then . Landing orbit coming up . Cabin pressure zero . Ready for transfer to landing lift body . - 30 seconds . - OK . The on-board computer should take us within five miles of the landing site . Ten seconds . If we have any trouble with the guidance system , give me manual . - Check . - Here we go . Computer checks . Main retros five seconds . Roger . Three , two , one . Time check . Three minutes to manual , four minutes to touchdown . Manual . Give me manual . Landing lights . Vertical jets , full flaps . Do you speak English ? I 'm air-sea rescue , Ulan Bator . I will get your friend . - Well ? - Results of the electronic medical check . He 's in pretty good shape . But the readouts on items 20 , 27 and 32 don 't make sense . They certainly don 't . Check the computer . - It was checked out this morning . - Then check it out again . Never trust them . - Any improvement ? - No . - Has he spoken ? - Disjointedly . It 's impossible to make out a meaning . Arrange for anything he says to be recorded . Mark , I want a total security blackout on news of their return until we find out what the devil 's gone wrong . What about that Mongolian rescue team ? I called my opposite number in the Soviet Academy of Space Science . - They 've agreed to cooperate . - Does the clampdown include Mrs Ross ? No , tell her to stand by . Pontini . No one except authorized personnel are to see any results until all computers have been completely rechecked . - You 're responsible . - It 's my department . - Well ? - Dr Kane is still unconscious . - And Colonel Ross ? - Apart from the shock and superficial ... Is he fit ? I don 't want details , I only want to know one thing . - Is he fit for questioning ? - Yes . - Do I have to go through with this ? - It 's your job . Before we start , this is the interrogation room , not debriefing . That 's right . Sit down , please . - Why did you turn back ? - We did not turn back . - You claim you completed your mission ? - We reached the new planet , yes . You agree that to fly there and return takes six weeks ? Yes . You accept that you have returned three weeks after launching ? Well , I can 't explain that . All I can say is ... - You completed the electronic survey ? - Yes . Of the new planet ? - Yes . - And returned to Earth ? - We crashed . - On Earth ? - On the planet . - You 're here ! On Earth ! To the planet and back in three weeks ? - I don 't know . There 's a lot I can 't explain . - You left Earth . Three weeks later you return - crashed . It takes six weeks to travel to the new planet and return . You were gone three weeks . So you turned back ! - We did not turn back . - Why ? Why ? Why ? I 'm sending Ross home . You won 't get any more out of him today . The interrogation leaves us with two possibilities . One - Ross aborted the mission and turned back . If that was the case , he 'd deny it for obvious reasons . Two - Ross genuinely believes he made the journey to the new planet and is as surprised as we are that when he landed he found himself back on Earth . This is the theory I prefer to believe . Only one snag . Why was there no sign of life on his electronic survey ? Well , that could be explained . Their orbit took them over the Pacific , Atlantic and the poles . The land they crossed is mainly uninhabited . All right . So we prefer the second theory . But three weeks to the planet , three weeks back . That 's six weeks in all . - They were only away three weeks . - That 's right . So they turned back . It still doesn 't make sense . The world 's most experienced astronaut and a leading scientist . Why ? The Council felt railroaded into this from the start . They 'll turn like a pack of wolves now it 's failed . They don 't know yet . And they won 't know until I establish exactly what happened . You can 't do that without the flight recorder . And that 's still on the Phoenix . Arrangements have been made to bring that back . When is Poulson due back from the States ? - Not till the 17th . - Thank God for that . - Was it rough ? - Yeah . Glenn , what really happened ? What do you mean ? - What made you turn back ? - We didn 't turn back . - Then it doesn 't make sense . - Right . You 're covering for John Kane , aren 't you ? No , there 's nothing to cover for . Look out ! - What the hell are you doing ? - He was on the wrong side of the road . It must have been rough . I 'll go make some coffee . Sharon , what 's going on ? - Sharon ? - What is it ? You know damn well what it is . This room . - What about the room ? - It 's changed . What the hell happened ? Some disorientation isn 't unusual after a protracted period in space . I understand that , but it 's never happened on any previous space flights . Keep me informed . If things get worse , I promise immediate action . What is it ? - What 's wrong ? - The writing is reversed . Everything is reversed . Jason Webb , please . Jason , this is urgent . I must see you right away . - Excuse me , Colonel . - Yeah , what is it ? - Over here , Colonel . - What the hell is this all about ? Do what they say , Glenn . - He called me . - From where ? Our bathroom in here . See for yourself . - He shouldn 't have been sent home . - He could 've killed me . This does it . I 'm getting out of here . - You don 't mean that , Sharon . - You bet I do . What happened after he smashed the bottles ? He went crazy . He said his handwriting was reversed , my watch . Everything . Well , look at this . Does this look reversed to you ? - The man 's gone out of his mind . - We don 't know that yet . Well , you may not , but I do . I 'm his wife . Remember that . He 's been violent before . - Like this ? - He hit me . - It was the flight . - It was before the flight . And like I said , I 'm getting out of here . We know about your personal life , Mrs Ross . It 's our job . - You better forget about leaving . - You can 't stop me . I can 't stop you leaving this house , but I can and will stop you leaving EUROSEC . - You can talk to him now . - So everything is reversed , huh ? - Everything . - Glenn , we 're going to check a few things . All right . Set it up . Now , watch the mirror , please . - Here we go . - Read it ! " Fire emergency checklist . " " In the event of fire priorities are assigned as follows : . " Documentation , research specimens , " photographic material , progress ... " All right . Good enough for you ? What the hell more do you want ? I don 't envy him . You completed your mission ? - Why did you turn back ? - We crashed . Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? You completed your mission ? Why did you turn back ? We crashed . Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Satisfied ? " Satisfied " ? That I was telling the truth about the new planet . You 're bound to be a little confused until the drug wears off . - You 're trying to check out my story , yes ? - Uh-huh . - You couldn 't fault it , right ? - No , we couldn 't fault it . You 'll hear the same story from John Kane . What happened ? Tell me ! I 'm sorry I 'm late . I was detained at the medical center . Come and sit down . What I have to say to you is very important . No , Jason , you sit down . You 've interrogated me , looked into my brain and found out nothing . I want you to sit down and listen to me . I 'm listening . Now , what I 'm going to tell you is bizarre , weird , but it 's the only theory that fits the facts . I propose a complete duplication of matter - a situation where every single atom , every molecule here , is duplicated here , except that it 's in reverse . Now , when I left Earth to travel to the new planet , another man left the new planet at precisely the same time to travel to Earth . Another Colonel Ross . The man you know as Colonel Ross is on the other planet standing in an identical , except reversed , room , talking to an identical Jason Webb who 's sitting in an identical chair rubbing his hands together at this exact moment . Look here . Now , what do you see ? Go on . You see the mirrored images of Jason Webb and Glenn Ross . There are now four people in this room - two Jason Webbs , two Glenn Rosses . What I 'm trying to say is these two planets have a physical connection . One is the mirrored image of the other . But , unlike the reflection in the mirror , they both exist . For every person on one planet there is a double on the other . Don 't you understand ? Until a few days ago , you and I had never met . Are you trying to tell me that you don 't know any of the people here ? Your wife ? Lisa ? Neuman ? - Only their doppelgängers . - Their what ? Doppelgängers - doubles . If you want a literal translation , the mirrored images of themselves . I think I 'd better get you a drink . All right , I know how it sounds . Can you think of anything better ? I wish to God I could . When I got your call , Dr Pontini had just completed a postmortem on John Kane . And ? Kane 's internal organs were found to be on the opposite side from normal . My normal , that is . It was all there on the computer readout when you had your electronic medicals . I assumed , wrongly , that it was a fault . Lesson number one - never distrust a computer . So , you see , your theory holds up . It would seem I 'm not the Jason Webb that you know , only an impish doppelgänger . How do you do , Colonel Ross ? - It 's only a theory . - It 's the best we 've got . But we can 't prove it till we 've recovered the Phoenix . If we 're right , your version of the Dove won 't be able to dock with the Phoenix . We 'll have to reverse the controls and the electrical systems . Or does the polarity of electricity remain the same ? Well ? Does it ? If we 're wrong , you do realize what would happen to you ? - It 's a chance I 'm willing to take . - And the other Colonel Ross ? Are you willing to take a chance on him too ? That was a penny for your thoughts . If they are as confused as mine , maybe sharing them would help . Did you say a penny ? Well , it 's a buyers ' market . What would you like to know ? - Sharon 's left ? - Yes . In a way , she left a long time ago . - Are you going to recover the Phoenix ? - Yes . With reversed vision ? How will you operate the controls ? It should be interesting . Don 't do it , Glenn . You 've done enough for Jason . Well , it 's not really just for Jason . I don 't understand . Well , you know how it is . There 's so much I 'm not supposed to talk about . Do you mind me coming over ? No . As a matter of fact , I 'm glad you 're here . Someone to talk to . Why did you reverse " Doppelganger " , Colonel ? It 's an inside joke between me and myself . - Good luck , sir . - Thank you . - Network check complete ? - All set . Proceed condition . Proceed condition . This is EUROSEC Launch Control . Phoenix on horizon . - Liftoff eight seconds . - Roger , Control . On-board computer indicates liftoff five seconds . Four , three , two , one . Report on ground systems . Procedures check . All systems go . Roger . You couldn 't stay away , hm ? Launch Control , this is Doppelganger . Airspeed 12,500 . Roger , Doppelganger . Countdown for second stage ... ten seconds . Five seconds . Four , three , two , one . Control , this is Doppelganger . Now leaving Earth 's atmosphere . Roger , Doppelganger . Rocket shutdown ... five seconds . Three , two , one . Launch Control , this is Doppelganger . In orbit . Roger , Doppelganger . Stand by for computer report on Phoenix position . Doppelganger , this is EUROSEC Launch Control . Computer reports Phoenix 20 miles ahead . Your orbit is correct for automatic approach to EUROSEC should there be an emergency condition . Thank you , Control . I see it now . See it now , Control . Beginning docking maneuvers . From now on , it 'll be just as easy as parking a car . For a man with reversed vision ? Launch Control , is Jason Webb there ? - Jason Webb here . - About to dock . Any additional orders ? - Proceed with docking . - Roger . Launch Control from Doppelganger . Jason , we were ri ... There are two planets . There are definitely two identi ... Doppelganger , say again . We lost your last trans ... - Jason , I 'm not reading ... - Repeat , we lost your last transmission . I 'm not reading you . Maybe you 're reading me . The retros on the Phoenix have fired . I don 't know why . I 'm pulling out . Again , there are definitely two planets . Identical , but reversed in some way . Launch Control , if you 're reading me , come in , please . Give him the automatic-approach system . - Dove now on automatic control . - Roger . Yellow condition . All stations stand by . Doppelganger to Launch Control . If you 're reading me , come in . I 've pulled out of the Phoenix . Extensive damage all systems . The one thing that 's not reversed is the polarity of electricity . Negative still negative , positive still positive . - Phoenix re-entering . - Is there a separate reading for the Dove ? - No , sir . - Re-entry speed ? Speed 19,000 reducing . Second blip on screen . Could be the Dove . - Speed ? - Stand by . - Speed 12,000 reducing . - Controlled re-entry ? As far as I can see , sir . Angle of entry - fair . Launch Control , cut automatic-approach system . I say again , cut automatic-approach system . Unable to affect landing at EUROSEC . All vertical thrusters have ... Maintain automatic-approach system . We 'll bring him right down the beam . If you read me , cut automatic-approach system . Unable to get off beam . Angle of approach 30 degrees . Red alert . Repeat , red alert . All stations , red alert . All stations , red alert . Launch Control , cut automatic-approach system . Unable to affect a landing at EUROSEC . All vertical thrusters failed . There 's no sign of manual control , sir . Cut automatic-approach system . Break contact . Mayday . Mayday . Mayday . Glenn Ross , John Kane , Dr Pontini ... The only witnesses - gone . Records , X-rays , documents ... Everything destroyed . So , are you surprised that no one believes me ? Come along now , Mr Webb . Once you get talking ... Put me through on an emergency signal to Dr Green . That 's right . Extension 402 .

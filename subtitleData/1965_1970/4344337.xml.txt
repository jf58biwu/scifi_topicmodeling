 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . Doug ? There ! Fire ! Tony . Tony . Tony . [ Gunshots ] Tony , over here . Am I glad to see you . - Buckskins ? - We 're gonna need them too . Come on . Keep low . Who 's tryin ' to hunt us down ? Looks like we got ourselves caught in the middle of a battle . - There are troops all over . - What kind of troops ? I don 't know . You know , from the look of these trees and these buckskins ... we could be somewhere in the southern United States . But where and when ? We 're gonna have to find a better place to hide until we get our bearings . Let 's go . - Over there ! Get after them ! - [ Gunshot ] All right . On your feet , you . So we 've got the two of you , huh ? All right , now move out . Don 't try to escape , or I 'll shoot you . Quickly , now . Move out . I don 't care ! Tell General Packenham I can 't wait ! I 've got to know what strength to commit tomorrow ! And I 've got to know today ! In fact , now . So you 're back from the American lines . Have you got that information ? - No , sir . - I told you that information was vital ! Yes , sir . But the woods are full of American patrols , sir . I know all about the American patrols . Who are these men ? - We ran into them inside our own lines . Spies , sir . - Spies ? Spies ? Now , wait a minute . Are you the commander of this regiment , sir ? - I have that honor . - This may sound strange to you , but there 's been a mix-up . We 're noncombatants here , and if you 'll give us a chance to explain , we can - You 'll have every chance to say what you like at your trial . - Trial ? - After which , you 'll be shot as the spies you are . Uh , Sergeant , take them away . [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . Now , Captain , you 'll relay the order of bivouac . Inform the major - no cook fires , troops to be ready for battle at dawn tomorrow . - Uh , begging the colonel 's pardon . - Yes . What ? - Well , I mean , sir , uh - - Are you expecting an American attack , Captain ? The woods between here and New Orleans are full of their troops , sir . Yes , I know . That 's where they 'll stay . The Americans are hopelessly outnumbered . They 'll have to concentrate their strength . Our task is to discover their weak point ... - and let drive at it . - Perhaps if I took another patrol , sir . You will , you will , you will , Captain , and this time you 're going to have help . There 's always a way to reach one 's objective . - Captain , I want you to convene a court-martial immediately . - Sir ! We 're not gonna pry these loose . They look like the leg irons off a ship . I imagine the British invading party brought them ashore . - Do you know where we are ? - I have an idea . You really think you can beat GeneralJackson , soldier ? We 'll take him right enough . You Yanks should 've known when to quit . New Orleans . We 're getting set for the last battle in the War of 1 81 2 . It 's going to be a bloody one and a useless one . Watch your chance . We 've got to get out of here . Sergeant , break these men free from their leg irons . - Do we have a fix on Tony and Doug ? - Not yet . We have a time lock on the period . They 've got to be in this area someplace . [ Man ] General Kirk , telephone . Thank you . Kirk speaking . - Yes , General Southall 's been cleared . Send him in . - The Pentagon ? No , General Southall 's attached to the British Embassy . I called him in . - To help us pinpoint the unit ? - Partly . He has a very special interest in the War of 1 81 2 . One of his ancestors was in it . - Oh , hello , Woody . - How are you , Phillip . It 's good to see you again . - [ Both Chuckling ] - You know , this is incredible . - Absolutely incredible . - Well , I 'm glad you could come , Phillip . - Oh , I 'm glad to be here . - Oh , uh , General Southall . - Dr. MacGregor . - It 's a pleasure , sir . - Dr. Swain . - How do you do . - General . - I 'm really , absolutely amazed . - [ Chuckles ] Phillip , we think we have a fix on the Seventh Royal Regiment . I 'd like you to confirm it . Well , I 'll help in every way I can , of course . - I 've located them , General . - Uh , where do I - Oh , all right . All right . [ Southall ] Yes , that 's the Seventh , all right . They wore blue facings on their red coats . - That 's the Butcher 's regiment . - The Butcher ? Well , that 's what they called my ancestor , the good Colonel Southall . Why is the identification of this regiment so important ? You see , sir , it 's possible to get a time lock on Doug and Tony ... if they 're with other persons we can fix in time historically . Our historical computers give us no record of the Seventh . Well , it 's nice to know the human memory still has some use in the world . My ancestor led the Seventh ... into a bloody slaughter . He could 've accomplished an easy maneuver ... and outflanked the American fortifications , defeated your Andrew Jackson . But he didn 't . The battle was fought on January 7 , 1 81 5 . The date our synchronizer gave us was January 6 . Aye , but the British will attack at dawn . The Seventh will be almost completely destroyed . If that 's where your men are , I suggest you get them out . The Time Tunnel is far from perfected . If we try to move them now , without an exact time fix ... we could kill them . Well , if they move with that regiment ... they 'll have absolutely no chance at all . By the grace of His Royal Majesty George III ... according to the ordinance of Charles I ... and the Statute of 1 689 , this court is convened ... Colonel Phillip Southall acting as judge advocate for the crown . The formal charge against you is conspiracy ... against His Majesty 's armed forces , espionage in time of war . - How do you plead ? - You can 't charge us - - How do you plead ? - Not guilty . All right , you have the right to be represented by counsel if you wish . We don 't need counsel . This has all been a mistake , Colonel . Oh , I know it 's always a mistake when you 're caught . All right . Have the record show that the accused declined the offer of counsel . - What are your names ? - I 'm Dr. Douglas Phillips . This is Dr. Anthony Newman . Well , well , well . It 's not often you catch spies who are also physicians . Or are you philosophers ? Well , I have here two passes which were found on your persons ... attaching you toJackson 's forces and allowing you to pass through American lines at will . We found these clothes in the woods . The passes were in them . - So you deny being attached to GeneralJackson 's forces ? - Yes . So , by remarkable coincidence , you came across some clothes ... containing these passes , and you simply took them . Well , if that story is to be believed ... I suppose you 're guilty of nothing more serious than simple theft . - That 's about it . Yes , sir . - Mmm . - And you 're not military men at all . - No , sir . - [ Shouting ] Then what the devil are you ? - We 're naturalists . Now why don 't we drop all pretense ? What is your rank , and to what unit are you attached ? We 're attached to no unit , Colonel . And we 've been nowhere near the battle area . That is the truth . Now listen . The only truth I want is the disposition ofJackson 's line ! I want a listing ofhis forces and his artillery . And I want to know his movements for the next 2 4 hours ! We can 't tell you that , because we don 't know . Well , you 're digging your own graves by your silence . All right . It 's the duty of the judge advocate to advise the members of the court ... on the application of law and to recommend sentence . In this case , the evidence speaks for itself . The accused were found behind British lines ... out of uniform and in possession of two American military passes . The evidence is quite conclusive . It is the unanimous judgment of this court that you be found guilty of the crime ... with which you are here charged . We demand the right to appeal . Your appeal is denied . The court hereby sentences you to be executed by firing squad . The sentence to be carried out immediately . All right , Major . Take these men away . Stay where you are . General . Well . Well , as you can see , my ancestor 's reputation is richly deserved . - Dr. Swain , we 're gonna try to bring them back . - [ Knob Clicks ] I 'm having trouble refining the time lock , General . Now wait till the last possible moment . Ann , superimpose their signals . Be ready to go when I give the word . - Is this what you call British justice , Colonel ? - [ Laughs ] There 's no justice on the battlefield , only experience . I mean , you left me no alternative . Surely you can see that . I 've no desire to kill either of you . But the evidence was so conclusive and your defense was so feeble ... I could scarcely let you go . My superiors would call me to account for that . However , if you choose to reconsider and cooperate with me ... there 's still time . You know , something just occurred to me ... that might soften matters a bit . There 's no need for both of you to die . What do you mean by that ? Well , I mean , that one of my men on an intelligence mission ... was captured recently by the Americans . They 're always willing to trade captives . So I thought that one of you might be spared for that purpose . No . I could have him killed before setting you free . I mean to say , he wouldn 't have to know . Wouldn 't work . The Americans won 't trade for me . He 's your man . All right . Is there , uh , anything I can do for you ? No . I mean , do you have a family that you would like to - - We 're not spies , Captain . - Well , that 's neither here nor there , is it ? I mean , the colonel keeps strictly to the regulations ... and the book says you should be executed , so he 'll do it . There is a way around the old man . And I see no reason why I shouldn 't do it , since I 'm in charge of prisoner exchange . But , unfortunately , it would only save one of you . It won 't work , Captain . You can 't play us off against each other . - No ? - Use my friend to make your trade . - You had it judged right , Colonel , and that 's a fact . - Yes . Seems that each one is trying to outdo the other in self-sacrifice . Touching . Bring that one to my cabin . Yes , sir . They 're giving us a breather , but not a long one . I want to try a transfer before they get separated . We 're still having trouble with the time lock , General . Look at him , Woody . Isn 't he vain though , eh ? Cocky , self-centered . There he is on the eve of a battle worrying about his eyebrows . Well , something 's going to happen to throw him off . - Where will the Seventh spend the night ? - Right there , where they are . Well . Now I 'm going to give you the opportunity to earn your life ... and the life of your friend . Captain Hotchkiss here is going to take your friend 's clothes ... and you 're going to lead the captain on a patrol through the American lines . - No , I won 't , Colonel . - Yes , you will . And if you and the captain are back here by dawn , then your friend will be set free . Otherwise , of course , he 'll be shot . - You don 't give me any choice , do you ? - [ Chuckles ] Well ... you were willing to sacrifice your life for your friend ... why shouldn 't you be equally willing to sacrifice your honor ? Is that all ? Sergeant . The colonel set up the arrangements for the trade ? There 's no trade . Listen to me . I 'm leading the captain on a patrol . In return , the colonel has agreed to let us go . So don 't do anything to get yourself killed . You don 't know any more about the country than they do . It 's a case of the blind leading the blind . - Just sit tight . I 'll be back by dawn . - Tony . Don 't you try any heroics either . This is the last battle of the war . Nothing we can do will change the outcome . History will take its course ... and we 'll be exchanged when it 's over . Trouble is , history doesn 't always record everything - like two anonymous suspected spies ... executed in the wilderness . Jackson 's forces are all about here . Now , when you 've changed clothes with the hostage ... you 'll take the other prisoner and infiltrate the American lines ... at about there . You want to scout the entire line , find the weakest point . - You 're going to tell us where that is . - Yes , sir . Now , there 's a rocket signaling station - Where is it ? - Uh , right there , sir . - Yes , there . Now you 'll be there before dawn . Your signal will give us our line of march . All right ? - Yes , sir . [ Sighs ] - What 's the matter ? - You have any doubts ? - Oh , no doubts at all , sir . Not about the directions , but what about the American ? - Do I bring him back here ? - Oh . Well , you know , Captain ... the first rule of war is to eliminate all elements that might lead to defeat . What I mean to say is , the two prisoners have been tried by a proper court-martial ... and found guilty . The time of execution is only a matter of personal discretion . So , when your man has served his purpose ... you will , uh , simply carry out the order of , uh , execution , that 's all . - Cheers . - Cheers , sir . Hold up . We should 've reached that first ditch by now . If we had taken a straight route , we would have run intoJackson 's pickets . I don 't know about that . Look , I intend to get you back to the British camp before dawn . Now if you don 't trust me , then you lead . You 'd like that , wouldn 't you ? - The chance to get behind me - - [ Rustling ] Quick , into those bushes . Hurry ! Hurry ! Oh , I 'm sure I heard ' em . You , scout the river . You and me 'll head back for the redoubt . Yes , now that we know the direction of the redoubt ... we 'll have no need for any more games of fox and hare , will we ? - It 's your patrol , Captain . - That it is . And in case you get any ideas of striking out on your own ... you should know that in the Peninsula Campaign ... I killed a man on a fast horse at a hundred yards with this pistol . Maybe you 'd better get something straight , Captain . What information you get out of this patrol is up to you . But I 'm gonna get you back to your camp at dawn . - And that 's all that concerns me . - Very well . Now move out . [ Chuckling ] One pull of the trigger ... and General Andrew Jackson 's a dead man . That 's quite a dilemma for you , isn 't it ? Whether to sacrifice your friend to save the general . - You won 't shoot , Captain . - Oh ? You can 't be sure of killing him from this distance . And you won 'tjeopardize your mission ... to take the chance for a little personal glory . Now if you 've seen enough , we 'd better get moving . [ Huffs ] I want to take a closer look at that right flank . Unless , of course , you 'd rather save me the trouble ... by telling me what defenses he has there . I wouldn 't give you the time of day , Captain . All right . We 'll have a look . Now move out and step quickly . We don 't have much daylight left . Halt . ! - We 're Americans . - Give the password . We 're new to this area , Sergeant , but we have passes . These seem to be in order . But you 'll have to come with us . We 're on a special mission for GeneralJackson . We can 't afford to lose any time . I 'm afraid you 'll have to take time to talk to Captain Jenkins . Take his pistol . Come on . Let 's get this one back to Captain Jenkins . You 've got the papers , but you haven 't got the countersign . I 'd call that a peculiar circumstance ... since no man was given a pass without the countersign to go with it . - What do you say to that ? - I 'm Captain Richard Hotchkiss ... of His Royal Majesty 's Seventh Regiment . And I demand treatment according to my rank . The rank is in the uniform , sir ! And you appear to be without it at the moment . - What are you doing here ? - I am Capt. Richard Hotchkiss of His Royal Majesty 's Seventh - Ah , never mind , Captain . ! I know why you 're here . ! But you 'll never get a chance to use the intelligence you 've collected . I can guarantee you that ! All right . Take him away . [ Laughter ] [ Laughing Continues ] Well , I rather thought that you wouldn 't let your friend back at our camp go hang . - All right . Let 's go . - I 'll take the musket , if you please . - Not a chance . - I insist . You don 't think I 'm going back through the lines at musket-point , do you ? - If you want to get back , you 'll do as I say . - That 's precisely it . I have nothing to lose by staying here . You most certainly do . If I don 't get back to relay the rocket signal ... the colonel will undoubtedly take the right road anyway . I shall be free in any event tomorrow . Now , do we stay or do we go ? - This is far enough . - We 're not halfway there . I can make better time alone . Your colonel made a bargain , Captain . We don 't make bargains with the enemy . Technically , you 're under sentence of death , which has been delayed . And I have been assigned to carry it out . Now get behind that bush . Move ! There 's no need to be nervous , boy . We 've all got to die sometime . Now get up . If I could only talk to him ... know what he 's thinking . Oh , you 've no idea how many times I 've had to answer for his mistakes . You know the sort of thing . " " Oh , you 're a Southall ... - relative of the Butcher of New Orleans , " and so forth . - [ Chuckling ] - Eh , doesn 't seem to have done you any harm . - No , no . I don 't suppose so . It might even be responsible for my success , such as it is . You know , made me work harder and all that . Ah , Woody . You know , I 'm not under orders at the moment . I 'm on terminal leave from the army ... and I 've no family , nobody . What I mean is - is this . I want you to send me back there . - Why , it 's out of the question . - No . I want to talk to this man . I have to know what he was thinking ... why he butchered 500 men . I 'm sorry , Phil . But the answer has to be no . Even if I wanted to let you go , I haven 't got the authority . You don 't . - Well , then , who has the authority ? - [ Chuckles ] - You try to go over my head , huh ? - Yes , why not ? - Yes . - It won 't do you any good , Phil . Is that your direct line to the Pentagon ? [ Sighs ] Yes . Lieutenant ! Bring in that prisoner . The one that Hotchkiss took this afternoon . Sir . That 's all , Lieutenant . Well , I want you to look at this map on the table . - I said , look at the map . - I can 't help you , Colonel . Oh , but you will help me . I promise you that . Before you leave this cabin , you 're going to tell me ... exactly where General Jackson 's strength is concentrated . You 're going to give me exact listings of all the troops on his right flank . You didn 't understand me , Colonel . I can 't tell you anything , because I don 't have the information that you want . I could kill you , here and now . - Yes , what is it ? - Uh , sir , the signalmen are outside , sir ... - awaiting your orders , sir . - All right . Come over here . - Now , do you see that clearing ? - Sir . You will proceed with the signalmen to that clearing ... and wait there for Captain Hotchkiss . If the regiment 's to attack from the east , you 're to fire a rocket in that direction . If from the west , you will so fire the rocket . Do I make myself clear ? - Yes , sir . - All right . Dismissed . Oh , Lieutenant . - Sir . - Wait for me outside the door . Well , my dear sir ... I have really no desire to see you dead . - But if you force me to it - - You 're lying , Colonel . Your intentions are to kill me , no matter what I do or say . - That 's the truth , and I know it . - Oh , I see . Well , then , [ Grunts ] if you can be of no further service to me ... I see no reason to detain you further . - May I ask what happened to my friend ? - Certainly . I imagine he 's dead by now . Captain Hotchkiss had orders to kill him ... - when he ceased to be of value . - Why - Lieutenant . I want you to summon the firing squad . March this man away from the camp , have him executed ... and then proceed to the rocket launching site . Take this man away now . Can we try for a single retrieve ? It would kill him for sure . - We 're tuned for a superimposure . - Woody . General White . Kirk speaking . Yes , General . I , uh - I understand your position . Yes , I 'll notify you immediately . Thank you , sir . - General White threw it in my lap . - Well , then , let me go . Not just for my sake , personally . Your man is in danger . I may be able to help him out of it . You know , it takes only one man to countermand the order of execution - Colonel Southall . What makes you think you can change his mind ? Because I know him , spent a lifetime studying him . I know all his strengths , all his weaknesses . I 'd be risking your life on the chance of saving his . No . I 'm risking my life - what 's left of it . Well , I told you . I 'm on terminal leave . So , you really haven 't the right ... to refuse my offer . Activate the Tunnel . [ Computers Whirring ] Phil , there 's a couple of things you should know . We can send you there in complete safety . But it 's doubtful if we can ever get you back . And you can 't change your ancestor . He 's a part of history . All right . I shan 't mind spending my remaining time back then . And killing Doug Phillips isn 't a part of history . Well , not yet , anyway . Countdown ready . All systems green and clear . Just walk straight into the Tunnel and keep going . Phil . - Good luck . - Thank you , Woody . Bye . Count him down , Ann . Ten , nine , eight ... seven , six ... five , four ... three , two ... one , zero . [ Drumroll ] Attention ! Ready . ! Aim ! Fire ! Shoot him ! - Well , where did you come from ? Who are you ? - Ah ? Ah . I 'm Brigadier General Phillip Southall of the British War Office ... and I want to see your commanding officer . Look , I asked you , where did you - - General Southall , did you say , sir ? - Yes , I did . - Yes , sir . Will you come with me , sir ? - Certainly . After I 've had a wash and tidy up . Uh , yes , sir . Uh , fo-follow me , sir . [ Brush Snapping ] - [ Yells ] - [ Gunshot Reverberating ] - Give me the musket . - Help ! [ Hotchkiss ] Help me , somebody . ! Help . ! - Help . ! - It could be a hundred yards . It could be half a mile . Stay here . You come with me . Oh , for the love of heaven , help me out of here ! Help me ! I will . Only because I need you . Now , give me the musket ! Help me . Help me . Help me ! Help me . I can 't hold on to it . Help me , quick ! Give it to me again ! Give it to me . Give it to me . [ Groans ] Get something else . Get another - - Get something to help me out of here ! - Don 't panic ! - Don 't panic . You 'll sink faster . - Get something else . Quick ! Get something else ! Come on . Grab it . - Pull ! - [ Grunting ] [ Grunting ] You 're almost out . - Are you all right , sir ? - Yes . - What time is it ? - It 's about 5 : 00 in the morning . It 'll be daylight soon . How far is your signaling station from here ? - Well , about half a mile , Captain . - Hmm . I think it is appropriate you see the signal ... that will lead to the defeat of your army ... before I kill you . Kill him ? But he just saved your life ! Colonel Southall gave orders to execute him . Now move him out . [ Laughing ] It 's incredible ! It 's impossible . It 's fantastic . Listen to me , sir . If I were to believe that you come from the future ... I 'd have to believe that I myself are going mad . Well , how else can you account for what I 've told you about yourself ... - about your family ? - [ Laughing ] - [ Laughing Continues ] - Well . But my present interest is to discover if you have a present intention ... of committing your brigade against the strong west flank ofJackson 's fortifications ... - come what may . - My present intention ? Of course not ! I intend to attack his weak side . - Which is ? - That information , sir , I hope to have ... signaled to me from a rocket in the forward position , here . Colonel , an official investigation will show ... that rocket will tell you to attackJackson 's east flank . Why will you attack his west flank ... and sacrifice 500 British lives ? Why , sir , do you continue to insult my intelligence ... with this constant pretense that you can see into the future ... indeed , that you come from the future ? And fanciful jokes about official investigations are not to my liking . There will be an official investigation . Oh , really ? And what , pray , shall I say ? Your written statement in the course of that investigation ... will begin with an entry from your own field report ... written in your own hand . It will read ... " " January 7 , 1 81 5 - " " In spite of repeated requests to General Packenham ... " " for the number of brigades to commit today ... " and for intelligence as to the point in Jackson 's defense line ... " against which they ought to be committed ... I received no reply . " In this book ... just one half hour ago ... I wrote in my own hand ... " " January 7 , 1 81 5 - In spite of my repeated requests ... " " to General Packenham for orders ... " " for the number of brigades to commit today ... and for intelligence as to the point in Jackson 's defense line " - And do you still say that it is your intention ... to attack in accordance with that rocket ... - and not against it ? - Huh ? Yes . That 's what I say . I do . You will set the rocket to the east , Lieutenant . - That 's Jackson 's weak side . And , uh , light the fuse . - Yes , sir . Well , I appreciate your help . I never could have done it without you . And now , I intend to carry out my promise . Let 's get out of here . No ! - No , you 've faced the rocket the wrong way ! - [ Rocket Fires ] Colonel , the signal rocket ! - Well , where 's the rocket ? - West . ! West ? That means we attackJackson 's west flank . That 's the weak side . All right . Give the order to march . Well , General , I still don 't really believe anything about you . - But , if you like , you can march in the second rank . - Thank you . Oh , by the way , I trust you heard my order to attack in accordance with the rocket . Yes . Yes . Thank you very much . [ Ray ] The Royal Scottish Highlanders . I 'm getting a signal for General Southall . We can 't take a triple , General . We 'd be stretching it to take a double . We 'll stretch it then . I don 't intend to leave General Southall there . - When you have the three signals superimposed , let me know . - Yes , sir . [ Bagpipes , Drums ] They 're coming right into us - right into our strong point . Hold your fire ... until I give the command ! [ Continues ] It 's gonna be a bloody one . - We 'd better get out of here . - We can 't do it , Tony . They sent someone back through the Tunnel to help us - a British officer . He saved my life . Well , if he 's out there ... nothing can help him . Fire ! [ Gunfire Continues ] [ Explosions , Gunfire Continue ] [ Gunfire Continues ] Are the signals superimposed ? I 'm losing the signal for General Southall . Why is he losing radiation ? There 's only one explanation . I think he 's dying . - General . - Yes - - The Tunnel ? - Yes . The Tunnel . Listen . I want you to do something for me . Just in case your chaps back there ... didn 't see all of this ... I want you to tell them ... Colonel Southall was not a butcher . He made ... an honest error . He was misled by ... a rocket signal . And it moved him in the wrong direction . Now , listen . I want that on the record . Will you see to that for me ? - We will , sir . - Very good . - Doug , we 've got to get help . - Oh , no , lads . Don 't trouble about that . It 's too late for that . It 's too late . It 's all right . This was all ... well worth it . Well , you know it 's not everybody ... that gets the chance to meet ... his ancestor . [ Thunderclap ] - Nice hospitable place . - What 's that smell of sulfur ? There 's ground tremors and lightning , sulfur in the air . It all adds up to one thing - a volcano . And we could be standing right on top of it . Tropical growth - we 're not far from the equator . But where ? - Things are getting rough . - Doug , you know quite a bit about volcanoes . - What are the chances of this one blowing ? - By the looks of things ... - I 'd say they were 1 00 % sure . - Well , is there - - Is there any way of knowing when ? - It 's impossible to say . It could happen months from now ... - or in the next ten seconds . - That 's not much help . Well , I haven 't got any information to go on , Tony . I don 't know whether we 're on a mainland , island or what . Well , wherever we are , it 's a long way from civilization . - That 's for sure . - [ Screaming ] [ Steam Hissing ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Doug ] Hold it . ! Put him down . !

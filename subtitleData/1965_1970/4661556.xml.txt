You will have to answer to the authorities ! didn 't you hear we are going to another planet ? Professor ? All the newspapers are talking about it . look . have decided to take beings from our own . But I cannot comprehend to what ends . Professor . what are we going to do about it ? until we know where they are going . If only this had some taste to it . At least its nourishing . Yuck ! I want to go home . and make them change their minds ? You can 't We will settle our differences later . with me ? With you ! don 't you agree ? Damn thief ! Gangster ! Lets go . Restrain me !

You should reconsider . there won 't be too much for you to choose from . but you will . Don 't snore . They have arrived . They have arrived ! Taquito ? they have arrived ! They have arrived at Civila ! What is all this about civila ? - Civila ! The planet of perpetual daylight ! Professor . but we must wait . Professor . As long as we make it on time . let 's get some rest . wake up - Huh ? we are about to arrive . And what is this for ? please . and your little friends . I wont wear it . young man . Why ? Because I say so . no need to argue . Beto ? Beto ! Yes boss ? Here . What is it ? Put it on ! come on boss . I command it ! No arguing that . Ramon ? Ramon ! What is it ? I don 't know . So this is Civila ? What 's up ? right . miss . That sounds just fine . right ? the Sun never sets here . you will be blinded within minutes . And be kind enough to follow us . You heard that ? No chance of a bad night here . Nice statues . there are more here . they can move ! Mommie ! I am Adastrea Queen of Civila . what 's all this then ? This is how we rest in Civila . I couldn 't give a damn about that . What I want to know is why have you brought us here . you have not been briefed ? No ... but there is no need to be upset . You will be treated as friends . Like good old friends . Liar ! Why did you do this Adastrea ? my sister . Alburnia . I told you I was against it . That you should not carry out this madness . Are you forgetting that I am Queen ? Because I conceded my rights . I beg of you to ignore this minor family affair . I 'll take care of this broad . I hope no one else dare face my necroluminescent spears . What will you do to him ? How dare you talk to our queen like that ! he will calm down soon enough . what will you do to us ? You will soon know . Adastrea . First you must take care of our guest 's accommodations . My sister will accompany you to your rooms . You may leave . Leave ! Before I loose my patience ! Beto ? Soon we will loose all doubts . Take him to the experiment room . This one will be yours . But ... but at the right moment . what is your name ? Silvia . I hope we can become the best of friends . Follow me . You two can stay here . Beto ? This will be your room . not know . It 's horrendous . That 's soft . What do they want with us ? If I only knew . Pay attention . you will always be under my control . and be able to serve you better . you must follow my orders . I will be most inflexible with whoever does not . even what you are thinking about . until you are summoned for your meals . let 's go home ! Oh mommie ! as long as you correspond likewise . without mercy ! Carefully ! depends our future . how can you think of sleeping at a time like this ? right ? Beto ? Come on ! They have left their rooms . but this is of more interest to me . What could they be doing to your friend ? But he is dead . I know . but the solution is not definitive . Are you aware boss ... . Are you aware of what those women are doing ! ? Y .. yes ... they are dissecting poor Ramon . Seems they want to use his lungs for ... an adapter of some sort . Oh no ... ! I won 't let them ! They want to use us like rabbits for their experiments ! But they won 't get me ! Let 's go boss ! Let 's leave this place ! Let 's go before its too late ! - it 's that ... look at them ... . the same to us ! - Beto ! - just look at them ! Yes yes Let 's go boss. let 's go ! let 's go ! Where are you going ! both will be lost . Beto ! Let 's go . Help ! Help me ! Is there no one that can hear me ! I am going blind ! One of the men managed to escape ! He has left the palace . the Sun will not let him get far . Boss ! No ! I can 't see ! No ! I can 't see a thing ! who are you ! ? Where are you taking me ! ? Who are you ! ? Where are we going ! Who ? I can 't see ! I can 't see a thing ! Where are you taking me ! Who are you ! I am blind ! It is what he wanted . Take him to the experiment room . Where ? Where are you taking me ! What will you do to me ! No ! Let me go ! Let me go ! My sister must be very busy as to not share the table with you . that we can talk without being watched . Why don 't you tell us once and for all what this is all about . I will try . It will be difficult to have another opportunity like this . is inhabited by a small group of soulless women . Of whom Adastrea is Queen . You are not like her . We are the first instance of twin sisters . That permitted ... We understand that you have inherited a kindness that she does not have . but I must not talk about that now . but have failed . Why ? Because our lungs are not adapted to the atmosphere found in your planet . We can last there a day or so . That is why she has brought inhabitants of earth . a transplant . Yes . will allow us to remain on Earth longer . that is what was done to Ramon ? And now they are doing it to the one who fled . not Beto ! now they will have two adapters . and can send two of the women to your planet . Where are you going ? and I fear for him . he is quite safe . It will be best for you to stay . We would draw unwanted attention otherwise . calm down . she can be trusted . She tells me the experiment has concluded . My sister is on her way here . it would be best for us to not be seen . and there we can talk for a few moments more . Are you ready ? let me know . And why so much interest in helping us ? we could be heard ! there are no monitoring screens here . separated by divinity . One embodies all that is evil - Yeah yeah .. kindness ? I am not like my sister . help us escape . I cannot . You will need protection . you will be blinded in a mere instant . And if we could get some visors ? not even with those . You would not know how to pilot our spaceships . I have a better idea ! and will make sure someone comes for you . she should seek Professor Daniel Wolf and a great man of science . please write this down . They must bring eye protection against solar radiation . and weapons to defend themselves . What kind of weapons ? only with those can they have a chance of success . They must carry out all of our guidelines . fatally so . Cythia will give this to your friend . And when will she leave ? At the time of rest . come back before you are destroyed by Earth 's atmosphere . Give him this card with the instructions . they will be defenseless and will be annihilated . and good luck . Why did you not prevent this ! we where late . you lot must go after her ! Do not allow them to make contact with anyone ! or they will have the advantage ! You will take two of the life adapters we have completed . Fitia must return in a few hours or perish . at once ! You ... you are the one who is to blame ! Fitia has left following my orders . Why have you betrayed me ? having as much right as you do . I had no interest ruling over a group of women so cruel and merciless . Then why get involved ? Because I will not allow your cruelty towards the innocent . I ... will ... destroy you ! Why not go ahead ? I will tell you why not . Because your life is tied to mine . The day I die ... you will follow as well . No ! it is not true ! That is just a stupid legend ! But you do not wish to risk it being true ... right ? I wish not to harm you because you are my sister . starting today . You will not foil my plans again ! Adastrea . We shall see . Professor Daniel ? Professor Daniel ! Professor Daniel ! There she is ! Look . These are the instructions she had with her . she is here ! Where could she have gone ? Not very far . she will not survive . Hello ? at your service . I received your message . Are we leaving soon ? I will get ready then . may I borrow your car ? thanks I I had a a plan ... it is necessary ... that you all ... carry to Civila a ... . I leave at midnight . But I will not make any statements . Professor ! Professor ! She is dead . She is of no concern any longer . Professor . And she a very strange outfit on . possibly . she said something about that . Then you where able to talk to her ? she croaked . Why is she here ? It would have been useful to interrogate her . all that is left is to inform the authorities and get ready . we will be on our way to Civila . Mistress . but there is something else . Our life adapter can only function for a few days . It is possible that ... I understand . and adult organism is too worn out . Now that I think of it ... it will be with another person that we will experiment with . You two must remain on Earth . And be on guard for my next orders . you desire less nourishment . keeping you company ! Tell us once and for all what you will do to us . I would have already . Had you not insisted on being disobedient . I had nothing to do with that . He was the one that left the room . You need not tell me . I know all . But there is something I must tell you . You must not trust anyone pretending to help you . Even if that person is my sister . She is under surveillance as you lot . To think that we are here because of you . we would not be here either . is to make you play for your swindle . He who steals from a thief ... Thief ? me ? Filthy shyster boxer ! Me ? a thief ? Filthy ... shyster ... and boxer ! You disgusting ... ! Sorry . The only good part of this is that I got on your nerves . let us go . Do it for our son . I regret not being able to treat you . He is precisely the one I need . he is in the experimentation room . Don 't harm my son ! Please ! He is my son ! My son ! you cannot give in to such infamy ! Aside ! My decree 's are not up for discussion ! Mistress . Results ? it is children 's lungs that we need . It is quite logical . They young will not be as worn out as the adults . indefinitely . How do you feel ? Where is my Mommy ? look for her . why sacrifice him . when we will need so many . Mommy ! Mommy ! Victor ! My son ! Are you ok ? Yes Mommy . Thank you Lord ! Professor . Look . There is Civila . The planet of soulless women . you can 't convince me women have any soul . Why do you say that ? Why ? They have always treated me badly . That spaceship ... It 's from Earth ! And its headed here ! Prepare the guards ! wait ! and have our Sun take care of them for us ? they will end up blind . And would no longer be a ... problem . Leave them be . We will wait for them here ! Listen . come here ! a space ship ! It 's from Earth ! they will go blind ! I must speak to your Queen ! Leave me be ! Marcos ? A space ship from Earth is arriving . I must warn them of the danger they face . before its too late ! - They must all return to their rooms . - You 'll have to kill me first ! With pleasure . they are capable of doing it . This is just one more debt for your Queen . but for other reasons . I can be very useful to her . Come . Oh my ! This Sun is terrible ! look . You are right . Speak . I want to collaborate with you . Why ? you think that is not enough ? I can keep you abreast of my mate 's plans . Are you not interested ? No . No idea of who it could be ? they will be blinded . Damn that Sun ! Planet of perpetual daylight . We will end up insane . If only we could do something ! It is evident that this Sun is much stronger than that of Earth . I don 't mind . Wait . We will have to face dangerous enemies . We must plan our actions carefully . Professor ? How can that woman be so cruel . Feelings have no value in this place . they could be listening I don 't care . My sister knows full well what I think of her . The people must have disembarked already . If they have ... they are doomed . Remember ... the smallest of errors ... and we will have failed . Damn ! Professor ! here they come . or you will go blind . we have arrived on time to protect your eyesight . Why would I need this thing ? that you will be blind in a few minutes if you do not use them . there being such lovely sights here . bro . imbecile ! Ex-featherweight national champion ! cause ... and one also has his own temper . My partner is quite dangerous because he likes drinking a lot . That is why it would be best for you lot and I to come to an understanding . Why have you come to Civila ? its just that ... we can make some business . What business are you talking about ? The blueprints to this spaceship . When this one said too much . He just can 't shut up when he is in a festive mood . So we had to flee . You will tell this to our Queen . You see how I was right ? Those guys can be your allies . So let 's go . Let 's go I could care less about blueprints . That spaceship design has been surpassed by us long ago . But with it I can return to Earth . That is why I insisted that you help them so . You may return . And they will take you there . But before ... I will carry out what has been agreed upon . can stay in my summer home . it is dangerous . whose address I have given you . and you will draw no attention there . Mistress . until the artificial planet is placed in orbit . Your orders will be carried out . you will be free . Bring them in . it is not convenient that they see you at this time . my Queen . what 's all this then ? Queen of Civila . Delighted to meet you . You are quite lovely . Taquito ? - Uhu . if you collaborate with me . to behold your beauty . Earthling . you will share my table . I ... I am quite exhausted . Take him to his room . These are my guests . But you shall be my guest of honor . he is the only one who may sit by my side . so I 'm getting dumped now ? Just like back on Earth . Do you know any of them ? assuming it would have been a pleasure . there is nothing else better here ? but you must get used to it . We have no alcohol here . Damn it ! My wristwatch does not work either ! what time is it ? right Silvia ? Yes . 2 : 20 all three of them . The time is here . just like last time . understand ? - Uhu . and you leave . ... it 's hot in here right ? I hope that ... - shush ! at 3 : 00 and must help us . Wish to better explain yourself ? We are prisoners of that cruel woman . Who wishes to perform with us who knows what kind of experiments . and you want me to ... where I shall never return . we are being watched trough the screen . from the experiment room . we will escape . Understand ? but why don 't you want to go back to Earth ? not with the best intentions . Taquito ? Ah ... yeah . 12 : 00 is the time . I will turn you in ! You are a cur ! and always do what is best for me . I feel that now we can trust him . Find him . What do you see ? An artificial satellite being inserted into orbit . Do you know what this is ? The fulminating mirror . It will send the satellite it 's deadly rays . And from there they will be transmitted to Earth . I don 't understand . The mirror collects the rays of our Sun in all it 's strength . magnified . Destroying everything . only what I place on it 's objective lens . send forth my message . it is a very secure place . to destroy the adults . Children must not be affected . You must gather them . I will need no less than twenty . The objective lens has been set . The rays will be directed towards this school . Nothing must fail . Mistress . I will finally have what I have always needed . But why ? pleasant stranger . who cares what happens . Professor . I forgot they could be listening to us . there are no surveillance screens in this place . We can speak with absolute freedom . it will be necessary to postpone the escape . How can we warn them ? can grab innocent children for their experiments . - Indeed . just a moment ! the Queen 's twin sister . I am capable of clobbering on that Queen . try to prevent this . Marcos said that we could trust you . you and him are friends ? to try and save them . I am glad this is so . was not quite favorable . but I had to pretend so she would not be suspicious . she is truly interested in you . Seems that way . that the escape thing has been postponed . - Oh yes . It will be easier for me to tell them . Must I tell them the plan has been postponed ? - Yes please . we must save those children . I will go right now . you come this way . Alburnia . Where ! - To your room . There you will remain under our custody . I must speak with my sister first . you will not be able to betray her anymore . Who are you to speak to me in such manner ! The one in charge of guarding you . or do we have to make you ? let 's go . eh . I will get Tony even if he does not deserve it . You stay here . Come ! We are escaping ! hurry ! Mink ! lets get ahead of them . Do you have your revolver ? I do . they will have none towards us . let 's go . The satellite will enter orbit at the scheduled hour . Alburnia did not warn them ! You go . gotta get some gum . the escape was postponed till later ! What happened ! we must see to their safety . I will be of more use free . I will go with you . - Let 's go The visor . to your rooms ! are you now assured of my loyalty ? stop them ! Good thing I had one left . That midget is a liar ! Taquito ! The one with the gum is a friend of Marco 's . The other one surely planned the escape . They will pay for what they have done ! We are locked in here ! my Queen . they are stronger than steel . my Queen . Find the others . we must flee . come . I could not advise them . The most dangerous ones have escaped . or alive ! the time to attack has come . my Queen . It is in orbit . Transmit the rays from the fulminating mirror ! The satellite will relay them to Earth . Take care to calibrate it carefully . I want the children alive . Elementary School Number 5 Come with us . What are you waiting for ? I command it ! You will be safe by our side . where are you going ! ? What has happened ? What is keeping Desinea ? I will go get her . she wants me . Here they come . Adastrea must have discovered our refuge . come . - Uhu I will take my sister 's clothes . I shall be Queen . then we can escape . Take her uniform off . and you will help me . Alburnia ... right ? Have them bring in the prisoners . while they risk their lives for us . - Agreed how would you and I fit in those outfits . what would happen to such lovely eyes . Nobody move ! not all is lost ! do you have the children ? we only await nightfall to depart . do not forget it . didn 't you already know they had been captured ? Mistress ? Here are the prisoners . Leave them . You may leave . What is happening here ? why not take off that visor ? Close it man ! We can defend ourselves with the mirror . The children come first ! The doors can withstand a few minutes more . They will be victims of their own experiments . The mirror is only deadly to adults . Take cover ! That rascal escaped ! This was easier than I tought . Not that easy . The game has many variables . the righteous always win . the righteous always win . Adastrea ? you will die with me . it 's not true ! Now we will find out . Stay where you are ! are you afraid ? Stay where you are or I will kill you ! It 's for the best ... I would not ... have been able to live with you anyway . Adastrea ? she will rest on Earth .

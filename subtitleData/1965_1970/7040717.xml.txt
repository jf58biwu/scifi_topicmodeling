 Well , this-this seems like old times , James . Yes , sir . Needless to say , I 'm-I 'm delighted that you just happened to be passing by . Happened to be passing by ? Sir , don 't you remember ? You wrote and asked ... Professor Robey ? Is anything wrong , sir ? No , nothing . Nothing . Just the toll of advancing age . I doubt it . I also doubt that you asked me to make this long detour to the university so I could chat with my old professor about his new chair of archeology . James , you 're being very complicated . Not really . I think that you 're in trouble , sir . What ? Why ... No , you 're right . I am in trouble . Black , horrible trouble . And I don 't know what to do . You just did it , sir . You told me about it . An excellent place to begin ... is at the beginning . This was the beginning . She 's beautiful . Who is she ? Her name is Lilith . Last year , I was in Mesopotamia , supervising the Sumerian excavations . Do you remember ? Oh , of course . You wrote . " The one transcendental experience " some people are fortunate enough to encounter , I have encountered . " Yes . I did write that , didn 't I ? Can you guess what was in my mind ? Yes . Lilith was my great experience . A white-haired December , reaching wrinkled hands out for love ... for golden - haired June . I might have married the child , if ... If what , sir ? If I hadn 't stumbled on the discovery that she was evil . Evil beyond the capacity of her years . Oh , come in , Robert . Come in . Professor , Chancellor Kyle and the others are waiting . It 's time to go . Oh , oh , yes , of course . Oh , this is Robert Perry , my prize pupil . Pleasure . How do you do ? I won 't ask you to sit through the boredom of all those speeches , but you will wait for me , won 't you ? Yes , sir . I 'll be right here . Wonderful man . I think so . I 've been worried about him , though . Something 's bothering him . This , perhaps . Have you ever seen her ? Professor Robey ? With someone like this ? I 've heard of girls that make your temperature rise , but this ? Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ... He ... ! I 'm sure I don 't have to tell you how everyone in the department sympathizes with you about last week 's tragic event . Thank you , sir . Professor Robey was an irreplaceable friend . Yes , of course . Tell me , West . When was the last time you took a real vacation ? Hmm ? Oh ! I don 't know , sir . Why ? You 've got one coming . I checked your MO file the other day . You 've piled up an impressive amount of accrued leave . Have you ever seen the Hanging Gardens or the Vale of Kashmir ? Excuse me , sir , but are you suggesting I take a vacation ? I am . Colonel , less than a week ago , I saw a wonderful old man burn to death , and it wasn 't a case of spontaneous combustion . I know . Today , somewhere alive are those responsible for the burning , and you 're suggesting that I look at travel folders ? Yes . I get the message , sir . West , do you have the idea that our bureau is a law unto itself ? It was created on Capitol Hill ; it 's answerable to Capitol Hill . Now I know where the pressure 's coming from . Pressure ? I quarrel with that term . Think of it rather as a suggestion from a higher echelon . Now , sir , if you could tell me what echelon that is . No . Sir , perhaps I could tell them how important this case is to me . Request officially denied . Yes , sir . Unofficially ... Yes , sir ? The pressure - rather than suggestion - comes from the committee in charge of our bureau . The Senate Surveillance and Operations Committee . Specifically ? Specifically , from the Chairman of that committee , the guiding political genius and one of the most influential men on Capitol Hill ... Senator Waterford . Oh , my dear Mr. West . Excuse me for invading your home like this , Senator . No , no , my home is an extension of my office . It 's always open to you . May I offer you something ? Yes . Whiskey ? Brandy ? A simple answer . An answer ? To what ? To this question : Why was I taken off the Robey case ? Ah , of course . Let me say to begin with , Mr. West , that I yield to no one in my admiration for the splendid record you have achieved . Thank you , Senator . Please , let me finish , Mr. West . But in the final analysis , we are all stewards of the people . We have a moral contract with them , and the terms of that contract are that we confine ourselves to federal matters . But the man was a friend of mine , and he was brutally murdered , Senator . I deeply sympathize with you , sir . But I must again point out , by no stretch of logic can that be your official concern . I am sorry . I see . Must you go , Mr. West ? I have some friends over . I 'd be honored if you 'd join us . Thank you , Senator , but I have to attend to official duties . Oh , please forgive me . Astarte , please come in . I 'd like you to meet Mr. West . Sir ... may I have the honor to present ... my wife . Delighted , Mrs. Waterford . Is this a recent change in status , Senator ? Astarte and I met in Rome three weeks ago . We came , we saw , and I was conquered . I shall never stop blessing that day . You approve , Mr. West ? Oh , yes , I do . I believe everyone should find their great happiness in life - kings , senators and chimney sweeps . And even lowly professors of archeology . Your Mr. West fascinates me , darling . Do persuade him to stay . I have , my dear , but he says he cannot . Well , you 've amended the record . May I ? Then you will stay ! Splendid ! Come , I 'd like you to meet my guests . Ah , our host and hostess ... with a young man bearing the name of ... James West , it looks like . Well , I see that he already knows your name , Mr. West . Meet Asmodeus , magician and illusionist extraordinary . How do you do ? Do you always wear snakes in your collar , Mr. West ? And now you can see why he 's going to be my star attraction at the Congressional Charity Ball next week . I promise to be unforgettable , dear lady . Mr. West , this is my friend and physician , Dr. Tristam . How do you do ? How do you do , Doctor ? Dr. Tristam is a source of exceedingly hostile vibrations . He doesn 't believe in black magic . Do you , Mr. West ? I have an open mind on the subject . Magic ? Oh , you put on a pretty fancy little show , Mr. , uh ... whatever your name is . Asmodeus . Late of His Satanic Majesty 's Company of the Damned . But your efforts to convince us that it 's magic , leaves me very tired , sir . You see ? One of little faith . What time is it , Doctor ? My watch ! It 's gone . What have you done with it , sir ? Doctor , call me a fraud , a mountebank , a charlatan , a peddler of tired , tarnished tricks purchased secondhand from a Hong Kong mail-order house . But a pickpocket ? ! For shame , sir . Now , I 'm going to start counting to ten , and ... Now , this may be your idea of a joke , Mr. uh , Company of the Damned , but as far as I 'm concerned ... I 've had all the hanky-panky I 'm going to take . I want my watch , and I want it right now . But , my dear Doctor , you 've never been without it . Oh , indeed . I suppose you 'll be telling me next that I ... uh ... Ooh ! Pack of confounded nonsense . Come along , Clay . It 's time for me to be prodded , thumped and listened to . My annual physical checkup . Please excuse me . Of course , dear . Asmodeus , you were magnificent . I do my humble best , dear lady . Ah , but I could do so much more , if people really and truly believed in evil . And now I must ask your leave to go . Baal and Beelzebub await me along with others at Mephisto 's . Well ? Well , what ? Well , aren 't you going to suggest we take a turn in the garden ? How very sure you are of yourself , Mr. West . Only in things that matter . Such as ? I 'm sure that a snapping turtle never lets go until it thunders . And I 'm sure that if you step on a spider , it rains . And I 'm very , very sure that the murderers of Professor Robey will dance the minuet from the highest gallows . Mr. West , how would you like to take a turn in the garden ? How did you do it , Ms. Waterford ? Caresses , tears , hypnotism ? What you 're really asking is ... how did I persuade my husband to remove you from the Robey case . How nice it is that we understand each other . What would you do if I told you ? Expose me to my husband ? Of course not . You see , your husband is suffering from a very rare disease . Really ? What are the symptoms ? Well , the victim invariably falls head over heels in love with you . Oh . What an adorable disease . That 's a matter of opinion . For the victim , it 's frequently fatal . That 's why I haven 't told your husband the unpleasant facts of life yet . Because you 're afraid if you did , it might prove ... fatal to your precious career ? That 's part of it . It is nice that we ... understand each other so well . Mm-hmm . So you 're declaring war on me ? And I don 't take any prisoners . What a pity . What are your views about ... fraternizing with the enemy ? It could be dangerous . But exciting . Well , if it isn 't Asmodeus . What happened ? Did you lose your way ? You make me realize how much I detest excessively muscular young men . Fair enough . And I don 't care for bushwhackers , even if they are all gussied up in a waiter 's suit . Jim , you out there ? Oh , they told me I 'd find you out here in the garden . I beg your pardon . Am I interrupting something ? Not at all . A few minutes more , and I may have worn out my welcome . May I present my friend Mr. Gordon ? The Senator 's lady , Mrs. Waterford . How do you do ? And the ever delightful Asmodeus , magician , illusionist extraordinary . Good night , dear lady . Excuse us . Boy , I 'll bet it was quite a shock to find Mrs. Waterford was Professor Robey 's little playmate Lilith , huh ? Same spider with a different name . Same web with a different fly . What I wouldn 't give to know what they 're up to . Artemus , start with the files . See what you can dig up on Mrs. Waterford and her tricky pal Asmodeus . Right . I 'll meet you at the car . Cab , sir ? Come on . Let 's go . Extensive multiple head injuries . Lacerations , possible fracture . What did you say the patient 's name was ? West , Nurse . Mr. James West . Well ? He 's still unconscious , sir . He 's been unconscious for six hours now , but ... Was it you who always said that West was indestructible ? Yes , sir . All it took was a streetcar running into his cab to ... get rid of that theory . Return engagement , Mr. West ? Missed me . Care to try again ? Very neat . I 'll bet you 're a big hit on the junior circuit with that one . But not with you . But not with me . Sorry . Really , I should write a strongly worded letter to that Hong Kong mail order house . They guaranteed me I 'd be a smash with you . Oh , well . Guess I 'll have to rummage around and see what else I can come up with . Don 't go away , Mr. West . ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I hope you forgive the intrusion , Senator . I ... Colonel Fairchild , I 've been trying to get in touch with you , sir ... We 've just received this message . " Imperative that you meet me " as soon as possible , " Senator Waterford residence . Signed , James West . " Oh , you got one , too ? So did the Senator and Dr. Tristam . I don 't think you 've met . No . Dr. Tristam , Mr. Gordon . How do you do ? Mr. Gordon . In that case , the messages can 't possibly be genuine . Jim West is still in the hospital . You mean , he isn 't ? West disappeared from the hospital an hour ago . Jim ! Thank you . Is that you , Artemus ? Yeah . Fancy meeting you here , wherever this is . Good heavens , man , where have you been ? All sorts of quaint places . Well , if it isn 't the great Asmodeus . It was a highly entertaining show you put on tonight . Tonight ? What is he talking about ? And you , Mrs. Waterford . The senator will be delighted to know with what grace and charm you presided at Witches ' Sabbath . No , Clay , no . Can 't you see he 's ill ? And oddly enough ... he seems to be drugged . That 's it , Jim , come on . We 're going to put you to bed . I don 't want to go to bed . It 's too early to go to bed . Listen to me , West . Obviously , you don 't remember , but for past 12 hours , you 've been in the hospital . Unconscious . Now you 're the one that 's confused . I 've been having a lot of fun , but I haven 't been ... Now , listen , Jim . Listen to me . For the past 12 hours , I 've been sitting at your bedside praying that you 'd pull through . You have been hurt . Do you understand ? Nah , it can 't be . Would I kid you about something like that , buddy ? Would I ? Come on , Jim . Try not to be bitter . Furloughs can be beautiful . Then help yourself to mine . Oh , it was beautiful the way they handled me . The cab with the built-in blackout . Who 'd believe it ? I would . Why ? Because I know you to be loyal , thrifty , trustworthy , truthful , reverent , clean , brave . And the great show Asmodeus put on for me designed to make me look like the village idiot . The capper , the little maneuver that had me hanging on the ropes . It was the way they managed to sneak another man into the hospital and give him your name . You really believe he was a phony ? A ringer ? Yeah . Once I had a chance to think it all over , yeah . As a matter of fact , you better cancel that furlough , buddy . I 've been doing some research on this thing and I 've come up with a theory about the whole thing . I call it " Operations Brain Drain . " Now , it 's true that Professor Robey met with foul play , but so , in the recent past , have a great many other equally distinguished scientists . For example , Austin DeJohn , one of our greatest theoretical physicists . Drowned off the coast of Norfolk . Go on . Asmodeus the Great happened to be playing in a theater in Norfolk at the time . Peter Kempley , leading authority on organic chemistry , met with a traffic accident in Great Neck . Asmodeus . By an amusing coincidence , happened to be playing nearby at the time . Here , pick a dossier . Any dossier . You 'll find that they concern some leading authority in one of the physical , medical or biological sciences , each one of whom met with a fatal accident . And Asmodeus just happened to be in the vicinity in each case . Asmodeus , or a little slip of a delicate blond named Astarte . Or Lilith . What are you doing sitting here , Artemus ? It 's not polite to keep Colonel Fairchild waiting . I 'm ready . I 'm ready . I don 't know how I ever let you two talk me into this fantastic scheme . Sir , if you 'll forgive me , what 's really fantastic is your notion that anyone would go to all the trouble of systematically eliminating one distinguished scientist after another without profiting from it in some way . Merely depriving our country of its great geniuses isn 't enough , we believe . So , according to you , all these top-level scientists are not dead . They 're genius is being harvested by persons unknown . That 's right , sir . When we open their graves , we shall find what ? I don 't know . Perhaps nothing . Gentlemen , although I was skeptical when you first brought this matter up , I must admit I found certain merit in your arguments that Kempley , DeJohn and the others were all buried in the same cemetery . But I knew Dr. Kempley very well . The remains in this coffin are definitely his . Well , gentlemen , shall we open the other graves ? No , sir . I 'm delighted to hear you say that . And , West , I trust you won 't delay your furlough any longer . No , sir . Are you humming ? Me ? Never . I just whistle in graveyards . When was the last time you attended a Witches ' Sabbath ? Well , any of you gentlemen care to make a statement for the press ? This is just the way I saw them , only Astarte was here . And Doris Dummy here ? Yeah . In the land of mannequins , who does the chanting ? Hey , that 's pretty neat , huh ? No Witches ' Sabbath should be without one . Quite correct . Drop the guns and raise your hands , gentlemen . Oh , the great Asmodeus ! Oh , when 's the next show ? But , my dear skeptical friends , you are the next show . The curtain is about to rise . How do you like my little retreat ? We find it very useful for impressing lovers of the occult . You 'd be surprised how many people are reaching for the beyond . Reaching for something more gaudy . Well , that 's pretty corny , pal . Yeah , I like the Indian rope trick . Do you know how to do that ? Oh , that 's very neat . Who has a cold ? You are insolent , aren 't you ? We 'll see how insolent you are after ... After what ? I prefer to have it be a surprise . Is this your whole bag of tricks ? The dummies ... a burning fire altar , mumbo jumbo ? Oh , no . These are little innocent trappings . There 's more , as you will find out . A mourning candle . Appropriate , don 't you think ? You ordered that for us ? Asmodeus , you shouldn 't have . Oh , of course . I realize we need two . Yeah , but you couldn 't fit the other one into your sleeve , could you ? Enough . You 're a poor audience . Oh , no , we 're a good audience . You 're a poor entertainer . We 'll see how poor . We 'll see when ... Oh , no . You won 't force me to tell you . He will do that . " He " ? He ! He ! And all the time I thought Asmodeus was Mr. Big . No , Asmodeus is too fond of applause . All right , gentlemen . Move over to that wall , please . Gentlemen , place your hands in the manacles , please . And lock them tightly around your wrists . I want to hear them click . Jim , behind you ! Glad to have been of so much help . Dear me , I shall miss Asmodeus . Don 't move , gentlemen , if you value your lives . Well , just don 't stand there , Artemus . What do you say ? Good evening , Master . Well , for law enforcement officers , you gentlemen have a certain native , rather refreshing intelligence . Won 't you join me ? But be very , very careful . Gentlemen , my laboratory . A modest little retreat where I come to putter . And develop charming little devices , like the chemical that causes people to burst into flames . Oh , one of my minor efforts . Actually , it 's a refinement of the ancient Greek fire . Applied to clothing , the chemical can be set to go off at a precise moment . Yes . I already know the amusing way that it worked on Professor Robey . Don 't be a fool , Mr. Gordon . Stop , I say . Your impetuous friend is unconscious , not dead . That will come later , of course . For you , also . Before you , um , nullify me , what is it exactly that you 're up to ? Well , can 't you guess ? I know you have an unusual interest in our scientists , the exceptional ones . Go on . I even toyed with the theory that you 're in the business of faking their deaths , that they 're alive , forced to work for you . What if I were to tell you you 're absolutely correct ? I saw Kempley 's remains in his grave . Just the dross , Mr. West , the unimportant husk . Allow me . Uh , may I present , um ... uh ... Oh , yes , yes . Professor Kempley , DeJohn , Dr. Lassiter , Professors Colahan , Byron , Cook , Fogelson , Carson , and Lind . The essence of these " exceptional ones , " as you put it , their brains . I have the collective genius of the greatest scientists of the day at my command . And there 'll be more , many more . Interesting . But brains without bodies ? Yes . Living on the electrically charged aqueous environment into which I have placed them . Living , hearing , feeling - and most importantly - thinking . Cerebrating at my command . What do you say to that ? Not being a fool , I don 't believe you , of course . You don 't ? Professor Colahan , I want those nuclear equations I asked you to formulate now . They must be prodded first before I get what I want . You mean you shock them ? That 's how you control them . Yes . And this is my achievement . My accumulator . Like a battery drinking in the enormous electric output of all those brains . Storing it , keeping it on tap until such time as I may need it , as I want to put it to work . And that 's where Astarte comes in , picking up scientists from time to time . Oh , yes , she 's been most useful . But not always completely successful , of course . Your Professor Robey - oh , he was one who became suspicious . Why did Astarte marry Senator Waterford ? He 's not a scientist . Ah , no , but he 's a very social animal . Oh , we made some splendid contacts through him . Oh , yes , he had his uses . Had ? Astarte has tired of him . She gets restless , you know ? So at 12 : 00 tonight , the senator will meet with an unfortunate accident . More fire ? Oh , Astarte 's idea . She coaxed the senator into wearing a cape to the Waterford costume party they 're having and ... oh , dear . In a half hour , it 'll be 12 : 00 . You 're not getting any heroic ideas , I trust . No , no heroics . I was just thinking how much that they must hate you . They ? Well , they 're alive . They think . They must know what you 've done to them , how you plan to use them . How could they not hate you ? You 're a hopeless sentimentalist . What if they were to make one collective effort , one big surge of power ? How much damage do you think they could do ? Why the idea is too childish to ... Listen . You 're an idiot . What you hear are the normal fluctuations of current absorption . Is that it , or is it possible they realize for the first time they can strike back at the one they hate with all their towering genius ? Desist ! Then it is possible , isn 't it ? No , it 's not . Then there 'd be no harm if someone was to say - " Strike back , but you must do it together , one united effort . " I said desist ! One united , collective effort with all your power and be free . I 'll kill you right now ! Artemus , I have to get to Senator Waterford 's fast . You 'll be all right here . Senator Waterford ? Will I do ? Such a gay , lovely night , Mr. West . Don 't you think we might declare a truce ? That 's an interesting idea , Mrs. Waterford . To begin , try saying Astarte , James . Astarte . Oh , you did that very well . Just a knack , I suppose . Do you remember the last time we were so close ? Yes . But don 't worry . Asmodeus isn 't around this time . I know . He 's dead . And I almost forgot - so is Dr. Tristam . You 're lying . Would I lie about such a delightful thing as that ? Please , James , listen to me . Forget it , little girl . You are all washed up . Please . Leave me alone ! Clay ... Oh , Clay . West , you 'll die for this . I don 't suppose I could convince ... No , I didn 't think I could . Before you fire , get out of that cape . What ? There isn 't time to explain , but in a few seconds , that cape will burst into flame , thanks to your loving wife . Liar ! Oh , he 's mad . Then indulge a madman . Get out of that cape fast . Do you feel the heat from the cape , Astarte ? Just like the one you sent Professor Robey . Let me out of this thing before it 's too late . Shoot him now , Clay . Shoot him now . I promised you a dance , Astarte . Dance ? What ? The minuet . From the highest gallows we can find , remember ? Merely a demonstration to prove that the hand is quicker than the eye . We will catch the ... We will , no . We will cat ... That 's fine . Now the ... card ... There is the inveterate card player whom you have met . What are you doing ? Practicing your old black magic , Artemus ? Ah , merely something to while away those long , cold , wintry evenings , James . You ... Oh , listen . Watch this . I just want to show you something . Artemus , I happen to have an engagement . No , no , no , no . I guarantee you will find this richly rewarding . Observe . Empty , correct ? Please watch carefully . We will close the cabinet , say a few brief magic words over it , and presto . Abracadabra , alakazam , ipso facto , the king of Siam . Here we go . I can 't understand it . According to the manual , it 's supposed to be a rabbit .

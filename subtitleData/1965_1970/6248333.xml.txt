 Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha To the people of this country The roar you hear is the sound of hope . The sound of Rhodes Enterprises Experimental aircraft 109 The sound of its crucial maiden flight . A flight piloted by Fred Norwood , one of our most capable test pilots . A flight that could signal the beginning Of a billion dollar air force contract . In fact , the air force insignia is already on the plane . in confident anticipation of air force approval . Oh , ladies and gentlemen Mr. Rhodes . Please a few questions . I 'm sorry , I 'm late now . Sorry , sir . That was Victor Rhodes , ladies and gentlemen . president of Rhodes Enterprises . The man who spent $ 250 million developing the X109 . Had a last minute call from the Board of Directors . How 's Norwood doing ? Still to reach the initial test of altitude . Chase One , you with him ? Chase One . Roger , I see him . Hey , something moving around to the north of here . I saw it , too . Looked like an aircraft to me . could be some civilian off course . Go have a look , Chase One . Roger ! Norwich to Chase One . Have you spotted anything ? Come in , Chase One . Holy Moises ! What was that ? Flycom , Flycom , I got a bogey here . Hey , here it comes again . Unidentified craft buzzing 109 . Repeat , Unidentified craft buzzing 109 . You ! What 's he doing ? That 's not on the flight plan . Norwich , this is Tim . Why aren 't you communicating ? Look at those turns ! What 's he doing ? Fred , what 's got into you ? 109 , report ! Not answering , sir . Well , keep after him . 109 this is earphone . Got a bogey here . Repeat , bogey . Chasing me all over the sky . Cannot identify it . Cannot chase it . Look at that . Mark 2 now ! Norwich , come in . He 's diving ! Fred , this is Rhodes . Bring that plane in , do you hear me ? Throttle down and bring it in . Over . Where in the hell did it go ? He tested every ship I 've designed . Fred is a reliable pilot . Look at the quotes here . Blood pressure , respiration , skin temperature That 's a profile of a man losing his head . Vick , Vick , you approved him , remember ? For the same reason I did , his records . Records don 't mean a thing , Tim , when a man panics . Blanchard . Where 's Norwood ? He 's uh ... he 's coming , sir . You were up there , what happened ? I 'm afraid I can 't help you , sir . I was looking the other way . What ? Well , I was checking out that flashing light we saw . Oh , that you mean the aircraft off course . No sir , it turned out to be sunlight letting off of cold air layer , or ... temperature inversion Just our luck you had to be chasing a mirage . Sir , it gave the impression of a flying object . yes , yes . Mr. Norwood , what the devil were you doing up there ? I was dodging that bogey . Bogey ? What bogey ? The UFO , the flying saucer . Flying saucer ? Well you heard me up there . I had everything I could do to avoid a collision A collision ? You mean with another aircraft ? I suppose you could call it an aircraft . It would fly . Disk-like maybe 40 feet in diameter . Shiny , metallic . Well if it was metal as you say , it appeared on the radar . Something that size would have to , yes sir . McDonald , why haven 't we heard about this ? Well , sir , all I saw was the 109 . And the chase plane . Until I lost picture due to static . Pete , it had to be there ! Norwood , I 'm going to be honest with you . Indications are you saw a mirage . Sir , this was no mirage , it was real . it w - I don 't know what else to call it . It was a flying saucer . No mirage , real . It was solid metal . The sun glinting off it . The sun glinted off it ! Now just a minute . Blanchard . Tell us what you told us a few minutes ago . Fred , that thing I chased , that flash of light , Weather people confirmed this now . it 's due to an inversion layer . Now Blanchard , tell him what you told us . The sun glinting off the cold air . giving the impression of ? Oh , the impression of a flying object . - Damn it , I can tell illusion from - - Can you , Norwood ? Maybe down here you can . But up there , in an untried aircraft , in a condition verging on hysteria That I doubt . - On hysteria ? - Yes , hysteria . Look for yourself . Here it is . Blood pressure soaring , pulse racing . Evidence , Mr. Norwood . And radar indicates that you were there all ... by ... yourself . Evidence , Mr. Norwood . Suggesting that you risked destroying the 109 to avoid collision with a mirage . It may not be the first time it 's happened to a pilot nor the last . Bur Mr. Norwood , it 's the last time for you in the 109 . Tim , we 're expected in the board room . I 'll be there Buddy , See you around . Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes Is one of those for me ? Madam How is he ? Here you are Freddy my boy A Vetry special 9 : 1 Well , cheers everybody . Done over the art arm first one today and all that . Fred ? What ? The Martini , dear brother , what else ? Look , Fred , if it 's just the job No it isn 't , Joe . You understand . It 's pride . I 'm the hot test pilot who panics and has hallucinations . Nobody believes that . Yes , they do . You 're my best friend , and ... you 're my sister and I can see on your faces you don 't believe me . Now , if you two don 't believe me , who 's gonna believe me ? Whether we believe you or not , we 're still on your side . I know that , Joe . and I 'm gonna take advantage of that . So take advantage ! Of anything you say . I saw that laser radar you have . I 'd like to have it . Along with two operators . I 'll pay ' em . I 've got 18 thousand bucks at the bank . Wait , wait wait , you just lost me . Well , somehow that saucer ... blacks out normal radio and radar communication Something like ... the ionosphere blackout our astronauts go through . You tell me that you think this saucer has set up an ionized cloud around itself ? That 's what I figured . But your laser radar ought to penetrate it . Give us a normal blip . Now , there 's a spot on that desert in Nevada . That there 's practically no air traffic . now any blip that does show up should be unusual . I want to get myself a fast job , like a B-51 I 'm going to model with cameras . Anything that 's moving upstairs I 'll go up and take a look . Do you want to try and photograph a flying saucer , is that it ? That 's it . Does the bed break ? That 's Dorthy , Milfred . How do you do ? - How do you do ? Very close in here , isn 't it ? That 's not too bad . I 've forgotten how crowded these things were . How was your flight ? Fine , wonderful . - Good . Good . Well ? What 's it all about ? It 's Norwood , Mr. Vetry . He 's so groggy he 's seeing things . He tried to land on 70 feet of air the other day . So we figured we better call you . The thing is , all of us work in shifts . Fred ... he ain 't slept more than two , maybe three hours at a time , the whole month . He just keeps going up there , checking everything on the scope . And today , for instance . A flight of geese , Weather balloon , A couple of false radar returns , He 's gone up , uh , ... six times so far and it 's only sundown . You mean to tell me how good ? You can 't tell the difference between a flight of geese and an aircraft On that scope ? Sure I can . He goes up anyway . " Wanna see for myself " , he says . And zoom ! He 's off again . Clumsy ox ! At least we know he is really asleep . yeah . Come in ! Mr. Vetry . We have a blip on the scope . Looks phony but I figured I ought to tell you about it anyway . You know ? yeah . Are you sure it 's a bad return ? Well , we all looked over pretty careful . I wouldn 't look for it , but ... he 'll raise a devil if he found out he missed one . Yeah . Ok , Pete , thanks . I 'd uh ... I 'd better go up there take a look . What ? Fly up there ? Why ? OK , I flew Mustangs all over Korea , remember ? Is it really necessary ? Yeah . I 'd better go . it won 't kill me , you know . Why didn 't you wake me ? Mr. Vetry didn 't want us to . We got something here , Fred . See , first it 's here , then way over here and nothing flies like that . Hey , remote . I see it ! Light . A flashing red light . Hard to make out . it 's like a headlight of a car coming at you at night . But it 's big ! Big and round ! I 'm going after it . Joe , we read you . Come in , Over . Look , I 've got two blips . Bogey closing in . Ha ! Tell ol ' Freddy I got him a live one . Tell him ... Something 's jammed his radio . Look , it 's buzzing ' im Like it did me . Joe , dive ! Get away from it ! Joe , dive ! Dive ! Joe ! Are you Norwood ? I didn 't expect you so soon . I 'm Tom Orvel for Federal aviation Agency . My partner , Dick Carey . We found this . It has your name on it . It 's part of my helmet . Joe was wearing it . We haven 't found the body yet . But ... I 'm beginning to think it just disintegrated like the plane . Disintegrated ? That 's right . I 've been investigating crashes for six years , but I have never seen anything like this . Vetry 's plane literally came apart in midair like ... disassembled piece by piece . What was he doing up there , anyway ? He was chasing a UFO . You mean this UFO is responsible for Vetry 's death ? I was responsible . Well , Mr. Peterson 's expecting you , captain . Go right in . The president 's scientific advisory board is handling that in . Well , build a firearm . I want action and I mean fast . Get back to me . Mr. Peters , Fred Norwood . Please sit down . Thank you , Captain . And give my regards to your CO . I 'll Sir . While flight testing the X-109 , You were buzzed by a UFO . Or to be more accurate ... you claimed you were . That 's right . Your flight control people said it was a mirage , right ? You seem to have all the facts there . Was it a , uh , mirage , Mr. Norwood ? No . Would you take a look at this , please ? Did your UFO look anything like that ? Very much so , yes , sir . Thank you . Mary , see if we can get the secretary on the scrambler May I ask you who drew this ? A peasant . Who lives in a remote border village of Red China . Mrs , Secretary , Norwood just authenticated our Chinese sketch . Yes . I think this doubles the urgency . Yes Sir . Give me Major Lee Did you say Red China ? yes , The peasant claimed that that sketch ... is the likeness of a " Thing " . Hidden in the ruined church near his village . How did it get there ? Presumably it landed there . The ruin was roofless . Landed ? By whom ? The bodies of two , uh ... creatures Were found nearby . Human like , and yet different . The peasant 's description wasn 't too intelligent . But we assumed they died because they lacked immunity to earth 's bacteria . But they must have been oxygen breathers . Or they wouldn 't have ventured from the ship . That 's purely conjecture , of course . The remains ? The bodies decayed very rapidly and the peasants cremated what was left . Major Laiton , how are you doing with the ordinance and survival gear ? Next week my foot ! We fly off tomorrow . Well try the marine corp , they 'll give you fast action . You 're sending in a team to investigate ? Investigate and destroy . Now Sam Archibald , our agent in China , They 'd get all of the second half . And it could be a hoax . But if it is there , that thing could be so scientifically advanced , that to make our technology obsolete . And if the Red Chinese get their hands on it The free world ! is obsolete . All this is top secret , isn 't it ? Obviously . And yet you told me much more than I need to know . Why ? Well , that 's obvious , too . You want me to go along ? You 're not expecting me to fly ? No , no , no , but you 'll build a career . Orienting yourself to strange aircraft . You might get some faint notion as to how it operates . Will you go ? Hurry up and wait . They won 't be much longer , do you think ? I don 't know , Dave but griping about it won 't help . Ah ! You forget . I 'm an American Citizen now . And griping is one of our most cherished constitutional privileges . Yes , sir . You may go in now . Fred , I 'd like to have you meet my two favorite geniuses : Jack Garson Electronics wizard And Dave Ethrom , master metallurgist . Gentlemen , Fred Norwood . The test pilot I told you about . He 's just agreed to go with us . Almost on the target . Sleepy , Jack ? Or just bored ? Trying to pop my ears . - What ? I 'm just trying to pop my ears ! oh ! Hey , Dave ? You ever jump before ? Me neither . I just hope I don 't freeze in the door . Rest easy , old boy . If that happens , the jump master chap will give you a shot . Thanks a lot , buddy . Time to put the hook up ! I 'm gonna remind you men one again ... To bear your shoes and helmets ... thoroughly . That means that there is not one inch shown . Group on me . Don 't leave any friends in the soft dirt . There may be red Chinese patrolling down there . And remember ... These 45s are the last resort . One shot is going to track a thousand commys . Whatever you do ... Don 't shoot our guys . Any questions ? Yeah . How the devil did I get into this mess ? Because you 're the most expendable electronics genius available , old boy . Stand by ! Go ! Whoa Easy does it . You must be Norwood . Yes , that 's right . I 'm Sam Archibald . Welcome to China . You alright ? I think so . Good . Got all the boxes ? The other two men are down safe . Fill us in , Sam . Well , our objective is about 75 miles due west . They 've got a Catholic church . Guided by the Reds ? Yes , about 5 years ago when they murdered the priest . The peasants hate the Commies for it . So when they found a saucer in the church The village leader got word to me . And he drew the sketch from memory ? Yes . So you haven 't seen the saucer ? But I believe the man . Sam ... What is the strength of the Red Chinese army in this district ? Four companies at Changsha And the territory between here and our objective is heavily patrolled . Are they likely to find the saucer ? Normally , a commy shuns a Catholic church Besides , they don 't even know the saucer exists . Well , you two apparently survived your maiden leap . Oh , no sweat . Piece of cake . ( Speaking in chinese ) Jack Dawson , Dave Ephrom our man in China , Sam Archibald . Oh . Red soldiers . Maybe they saw our parachutes last night . I don 't think their after us , Brad , they got a prisoner . Probably the peasants who resist the Chinese regime . Poor guy . Blue team patrol . yeah ... It 's too close for comfort . it 's going to be a long , hard journey . Alright ! Take a rest , everybody . How much further , Sam ? Well ... We 're about here . The church is about 20 miles here . There 's a village in the middle . that might quarter red soldiers so we better bypass it . What 's going on ? I want him to fill the canteens . but he sad he 's got a sore foot . I 'll get another man . Don 't bother . Give them all a break . I 'll take them . Stream 's right down that direction . Hey ! Wait a minute ! Please , I won 't hurt you . ( Speaking Russian ) ( Speaking Russian ) ( Speaking Russian ) Red soldiers ? - No , Russians Russians ! one of them said " niet " . Russians . Of course . I know one thing . Any more shooting will attract the Chinese soldiers . If it hasn 't already . I tried to stop Ephrom , but we can 't stake him down here . maybe we aught to pull out . It wouldn 't help . They 'll run us down easily , unless we abandon our equipment . Sam , go back and see if we have any quarters left . Ok . Hey , What 's that ? Americans ! Americans ! Don 't shoot ! We wish to parley with you . Ok , lady . Go ahead and parley . Our leader tells me to inform you ... Tell your leader to get out of here at 2 , or this parlay is finished right now . What are you Americans doing here ? If you are followed by our friends and allies , ... the soldiers of Chinese Socialist Republic , You will be shot . We urge you to go back where you come from . and we will not inform our allies that you were here . I uh shall take your , shall we say ultimatum under advisory . But I must confirm with my comrades . Fred ! I recognize one of their guys from the pictures in our files . Zagorsky Top metallurgist Your gun ! I had to break the boarders up , or they would have run away . They 're scared . Maybe they 're trying to bluff us . Let 's find out , hum ? Uh , tell your boss ... Comrade Tell your boss we know you 're here on the same mission that we are . We know you entered the country without permission . And that you 're just as afraid of the Chinese Reds as we are . If not , Why are you escorted by peasants instead of Chinese soldiers ? You are very foolish ! The Chinese are our allies . And they will exterminate you . We give you last chance to get away . You must go back where you come from . Otherwise , we must notify our Chinese allies , of your presence here . Ask him why he doesn 't notify his Chinese allies right now ? Now then , shall we forget this ultimatum nonsense ? As much as we both like to shoot each other , we can 't afford the racket . So ... Where do we go from here ? This is a good place for a breather . Alright ! We stop here for a while . I ... uh ... I did some research at Stanford , you know , metallurgy , of course . Oh ... Was professor Wilhous still teaching there ? Yes indeed he was . he was a great professor . Zagorsky ? ( Speaking Russian ) What did he say ? Well ... he wants to to discuss something with me . Excuse me . Delightful , fella , really . all charm . I 'd love to break up this little shotgun union . Hey ! There 's a man with a good idea . Yes , Dubovsky was going to take a shot at us just now . Well , none of us can do that . Well , uh , how about we strangle each other with our bear hands ? The important thing is to get to the saucer . Without drawing a thousand Chinese reds around our necks . After that ... we play it by ear . I wouldn 't mind being strangled by her . She 's a commy ! Where did you learn that word ? From my father . He was on the last war . Well , it wasn 't really the last . it was in one we fought together he came with those trucks we sent you . Oh , oh ! Without your American trucks , We would never have fallen Stalingrad . Thank you . I bet you have a great IQ . IQ ? What 's that ? Brain . Intelligence . Oh . An unusual compliment . Well , I wouldn 't dare make a usual one . Though I must say what I saw underneath the waterfall compares favorably with ... it 'll be sufficient See ? I told you I could make a usual one . What ? What are you doing when you 're not taking a shower ? I am an electronics expert . My specialty is Superretrobeam feedback determinations . Good for you . Oh , I know that you Americans resent women being scientists . In your bourgeois society We 're nothing but Haus Fraus There is true sexual equality in the Soviet Union Women are not different from men . Oh , my , that 's too bad . Soviet women may even be soldiers . Well , now you wouldn 't happen to be armed now would you , Sargent Karachev ? Are you not going to search me ? Say ... Are you sure Soviet women are no different then men ? That building ! The peasants made that roof to hide it from the air . I 'll stay here with the quarters . They 're afraid to go in . Mr. Peters You are in command here That 's right . So let 's not take any more pictures , shall we ? Comrade Dubovsky proposes that we agree to share this great discovery and work together as a scientific team to exploit it . You wanna work with us ? - As a team , huh ? - That 's right . Comrade Dubovsky says that later we may announce our discoveries to the world , together . now , just a minute . You tell him I 'm concerned about guns , not communicators . We carry arms only to defend ourselves against aggression . Of course . We know that . But still , I don 't like to see people working with guns stuck to their hips . So you tell your boss ... If he 's willing for us to inspect his arsenal , he can inspect ours and then we can come to some sort of understanding . Not inspection . Mr. Peters , It was I who proposed we worked as a team . and I can assure you I have no intention of working with gun in a hip . Nor I , for that matter . What use has come to scientists We will put our guns away . You put your guns away . But only each team leader be armed . Then we can work as team . If only you 'll trust us . I trust you . Hank We ain 't got much choice in the matter ... Comrade Dubovsky is also willing to trust you . Well , I don 't trust him . I want everybody to know this . So let 's get to work . Morning , Sam - Morning . I have lookout at strategic places . We 'll keep a night and day watch . Let me give you a hand , Fred . I was there just talking to Sam We 've got guided forces all around . Should be alright . Now wait a minute I will take a look up there and see ... It 's heavy now . I wanna take it up there ... Hold it . Pretty close . You think they got inside this thing yet ? Look , the entire exterior surface is completely unbroken . Not a sign of a door , a port , nothing . How do they look out to see where they 're going ? There has to be a way to get in this thing . Here ! Maybe using this . Here ! Feel this . Here is warm . Here it 's cool . The same . Let 's trace it . Did you find anything ? Could be , we don 't know yet . If this is door , it 's the most perfect fit I have ever seen . If there 's a door , how do you think it opens ? Could be like one of those electric garage doors on some sort of signal . Says Jack , where is he ? He 's working on some equations . I 'll go get him . Jack , you 're needed . I heard noise , inside . No , that 's not inside . That 's jack 's electric razor . No , no , she is right . Inside . I hear the noise now , too . Well , fellas , what can I do for ya ? What the ... .. Why did it stop ? Never mind what made it stop . Why don 't we find what made it open ? Jack , give me your razor . - What for ? - Just give it to me . This is crazy . No it isn 't . We just have to hit the right frequency , What can you see , Fred ? Not very much . It 's dark . There 's like a tube going up . and kind of a ladder . here . We can ... we can climb up on this . Well , Who wants to climb up inside ? ( Speaking Russian ) Comrade Dubovsky feel there should be both a Russian and an American to be forced to enter . Now let 's not start a lot of damn protocol . Comrade Dubovsky insists that such procedures are part of our agreement . All right , all right . You and Fred go in together , then . You got the razor , Fred ? Right . Easy there . Hey ! When did he close the door ? I didn 't hear the razor . They didn 't close it . But then what did ? Who ? Looks like solid metal from the outside . From in here , it 's transparent . It must be some kind of plastic ! He can 't see us , but we can see him . Pretty good visibility . All sides ... Where are the gravity couches ? How would they strap in ? Obviously , they do not . There can be only one explanation . Because no amount of strapping down could come back intense speed and quick directional changes you have described . And the power ! This craft must ... generate its own inner gravitational field . That contracts and equalizes all G-forces . Like the turn on the air . it 's like a draft . I think it is life support system . Not unlike those over at Cosmonauts . I noticed it began the moment we entered . it must be automatically activated by ... the carbon dioxide we exhale . Converting the CO2 into Ozone , or some other oxygen based gas . You might be right . When I was in Washington , they said they probably were oxygen breathers . That 's why they came on the ship . Shall we get the others ? Right . The door is closed . I 've to send this back to the factory . Shut it off ! What ? How do you control level of razor ? We probably activated gravitational field . If we cannot adjust it properly , We will be squished . Like bugs ! It 's creating magnetic force . Does it look like a panel ? That might control the gravitational field ? I don 't know ! I don 't know . Don 't say that , we gotta take a chance . It had better be a calculated risk . This could be a relay . The kind that opens and closes electric circuits . I can hardly stand up ! What is that button ? Of that I am not sure . I 'm only saying it looks a little like it . Come on , try . A shot in the dark . We were lucky . We ought to find out What regulates the gravitational field There must be ... There must be similar circuit to open door and floor . multiply would it not be located somewhere that you could reach here while standing near door . What 'd you know ? it 's a simple electric eye . How come we didn 't see it before ? Are you alright ? Got any antibiotics in vitro ? Yeah , yeah , in my first-aid kit , why ? A sick Chinese baby . None of us would know what to do . We 're not doctors ... Karachev will do it . There is infection in his throat . he 's coughing . Don 't you think you better read the instructions ? I don 't think that will be necessary . Lean over , please . Look at him now ! He 's wonderful . Sam ! Tell her to bring baby back immediately if he seems worse . Don 't tell me along will all your ... other talents you 're a doctor , too ? Oh , no . No . I wanted to study medicine . but the year I started school the quota was unfilled for electronics majors so the commissar of education decided otherwise . You just did what they told you ? of course . The State must decide these things . Just like that , huh ? You got angry with me ? You think he 's going to shoot me ? Comrade Dubovsky says there will be no fraternization . Oh , yeah ? What do you say ? Conrad Dubovsky is in charge of our nation . Germany ! Sputnik ! Have you figured it out yet ? - huh ? Have you figured it all out ? - Oh , oh , sure , it 's very simple . One thing seems certain . This craft is repelled on concocted by universal lines of magnetic force . That 's simple , isn 't it ? Oh , yes , it is very , very simple . The only problem is , so am I. Well , fred , what Anna means is for example , If it wants to go up , It fastens on to the magnetic attraction of ... say , the sun . If the sun is at its Zenith or any other star that is in that position of the heavens at that time of the day . Now to go down it just utilizes the earth 's magnetism . That 's all . What about horizontal flight ? Then it just beams on the magnetic attraction of ... . any star or planet that 's on or near the horizon . Believe me , there are billions of possible anti magnetism . Then why wouldn 't it pull this ship from every direction at once ? Oh , that is secret over circuitry . These controls properly adjusted , block out all magnetic attractions except if one pilot wishes to utilize . And this craft is aimed by magnetism and that 's all . All ? If we could utilize this principle , we could exploit literally limitless fields of energy . We could irrigate deserts . desalt oceans , increase production of food , of everything , one-hundred fold We could also manufacture one hell of a super weapon . What would the world want with weapons if every country was rich and prosperous ? True , Dave . What do you say we break for chow , huh ? - Chow ? - Chow . Chow is dog . May I proceed you , madam ? If you want to eat a dog for lunch , then be my guest . Oh , that 's funny . There we are . What happened ? Oh I tripped and Chet tried to save me . Oh , no . I just tripped over my own feet . It 's broken . Christ . Hey ! Sounds like someone Or something is trying to fly it . What the devil 's going on here ? What ? What he say ? That someone is trying to fly it . I knew we should trust you ! get out of there ! Take it easy . What 's the matter with you ? His teeth hurt . He has steel cups . Andre ! Andre ! Come on . They don 't want us at a time like this . You go ahead , Dave . I 'll be along a little while . Will you pray for him with me ? I 'm not such a perfect martyr . Why do you think he did it ? I do not know . But I think he would not have done it ... unless Comrade Dubovsky ordered him . You have no pilot . I 've got a flight engineer with a broken wrist . Why don 't you and I work together ? I would have to ask permission . From Comrade Dubovsky . No . You forget we 're not here to share knowledge with them . Forgiving them or not Impossible . A monopoly that would make our military opposition invincible . Now why can 't you attempt to take off with Jack ? Hank , believe me those controls are too much for a one-handed man I could kill us all . You saw what happened to Gadyakoff He 's right . I believe he had his hands so full That he couldn 't monitor the inner gravitational field and it built up and crushed him . Dave could handle that . I 'm the foggiest old boy . I 'm a metallurgist , remember ? You have no choice . You 've got to go with the girl . Mr. Peters . yes ? Comrade Dubovsky accepts proposal made by Comrade Norwood last night . That Anna and he been blipped off together . Sure ! Without a pilot he 's got no alternative . Neither do we . Hank , if they 're willing , why shouldn 't we be ? Alright ! Let 's get on with it . ( Speaking in Russian ) Good luck , Fred . And don 't try any more than just a short liftoff . I wasn 't planning any acrobatics . Wow ! hey ! Oh , Fred ... Fred . Come on , take it easy . Now that we are united in this Russian-American project , Guns are not longer necessary . Something wrong , Sam ? Red patrols in the area have been very heavy this morning . More so than usual ? Yes . They 've become aware of a kind of suppressed excitement in the village . Their suspicions are aroused . Could they have heard the sound of the saucer ? Well , my guards would have heard it , too . We better get back out . He 's good , no ? ( Speaking in Chinese ) You specialists and your high exorbitant prices . This is beautiful place . You 're a beautiful person . Zagorsky has translated your trusted leader 's intentions . He says , Fred , that you and Anna ... will fly the saucer to Moscow or he 'll kill us all . Tell him he 's crazy . Antoine . Your scientific comrade has explained the unbearable distress him greatly . Anna ! Go on over to him . - He 'll kill you . - No he will not . I ought to shoot Petry 's head off . What 's he saying ? That you tricked him by hiding pistol . Oh , my God , that 's wonderful coming from you . Tell him to protest to the United Nations . Now move . He wants to know if you are going to kill us . You 're not getting your information back to Moscow , that 's for sure . How do you mean that , Hank ? We do what we have to do . We take ' em out as prisoners . Would affect them practical ? My god , hank , you 're beginning to sound like Dubovsky . If you mean because he 's loyal to his side and I 'm loyal to mine I mean you keep wanting to blow each other up . Fred , whose side are you on ? - On the side of survival . Who 's to gain if we exterminate each other ? - I 'll tell you who 's to gain . The Red Chinese , that 's who . Your little war has attracted a Red Patrol . Keep an eye on that , wild man . Looks like they 're just reconnoitering . I suspect he 's radioing for reinforcement . There 's a whole company in the village . How long will it take them to get here ? Not very long . It 's only a few miles . - Keep an eye on them , Sam - Ok . How many ? Only eight . But it looks like they 're radioing for reinforcements . He said you destroy saucer to keep from Chinese . Tell him to shut up and stay in his own corner . He 's right . - The problem in you two is ... - Dubovsky , just shut up . He 's one of the greatest physicists of the world . He just wants to help us . - We don 't need him - The hell we don 't ! Hank , we all need each other . You saw what just happened . But Zagorsky and Anna had no part of it . It 's what I was about to say problem is that saucer is practically indestructible . I concur . It would take extreme heat something like a hydrogen explosion ... for instance , to ... to melt that metal . But this is the worst of the gear . We can 't just leave it to the Chinese Reds . We are in complete accord on that . Perhaps we do not have to leave it . - What do you mean ? - Fly it . Fly it ... Can you ? We had it off the ground before . It 's too intricate . There are a thousand things in there . I have this . Chuck . Please check my figures . This is an analysis of the workings of the controls based on mathematical probabilities . Do you think my calculations are correct ? We can 't tell without testing them , Anna , but ... Well then , get going . The rest of us will see you airborne and then try to get out of here . If we get airborne . - Oh , now look it isn 't that simple . All of this has to be checked out . I say it will take us about a half hour to run through it . Dave , give us a hand out there . Anna , come on , I 'll give you all the help I can . What 's going on here ? He told her to fly to Moscow . Fred , you 're going to fly to the nearest American airbase , Formosa . They 're coming , a whole company of them . We got to get out there and stop them . For at least thirty minutes . Hank ! Hank , Jack has to stay with the saucer . - and so do you . - that 's my point . You need Zagorsky and Dubovsky . Eagle and inferno , jointing forces to destroy dragon . Prediction made by friend stargazer who live 400 years ago . Nostradamus . They 're against the Red Chinese getting the saucer as much as we are . Keep down and don 't fight till I give the word . Damn it , Dubovsky ! I said to wait . Ready to get in range . Now ! Oh , yes , you 're good at shot . Ok , you 're a bear cat on wheels . Stalingrad ! And bunker hill to you , buddy . On the next time , don 't fight until you see the white in their eyes . Waterloo ! That 's I hope ! Remarkable , We got to stop them . Yeah . Only now they know our position and strength . It won 't be so easy next time . I 've run out of grenades , sir , can you spare any ? I 've only got two . But there more back at the church . Oh , I 'll go back and get some . No . Let me ... I 'm a police officer . Alright , but keep down . He 's hit ! All set . Eight . Eight-Six Four . Zagorsky . We stopped them , comrade . Bomb . Grenades . Grenades . Damn it , Fred , what are you doing here ? You need these , don 't you ? - The hell with those ! What good are they if they don 't apply that thing now ? You 're not expendable here . Yeah , they 're coming at us from both the front and right flank . it 'll be hard stopping them , mister . Hank , we 're set to take off on your yell . Then you fall back as fast as you can and join us . If we can . Look that way . Get going , but keep low . Hey . You and Sam crawl out on the right plank . If you can surprise them , You might stop those guys . We 'll give it a go , old boy . You 're a jolly optimist . Luck ! Cheers . How much longer ? - Not too long . Right circuit 's eighty and twenty . Listen . Shooting stopped . You 're right . Alright . Lets get out of here . Dave ? Everybody . Come on . Reset for horizontal flight . - Ready Jack ? - Ready Now ! We 've taken off like a rocket . and straight up . Level off , Fred . Something we 've done has put us on automatic pilot . The ship is running away with us . Reset to hover . - Ready ? - Ready.-Now. Nothing . It does not respond as before . My God ! Just these few moments we 've torn free of Earth 's gravity and traveled thousands of miles . Look ! The moon ! How could we have come so far in such a short time ? The spaceship ! Is approaching speed of light ! Over 11,000,000 miles per minute . The automatic pilot . Still locked to a pre-set course . Maybe drawn to some magnetic attraction . Mars , Jupiter , Uranus ... Maybe some distant star , many light years beyond our solar system . There is a whole bound of systems here we know little about . Thousands of them ! An infinite variety of combinations . and only one should reactivate manual control . And of which all we can do is try each one and that could take weeks . if we are heading for stars the nearest one , Alpha Centaur , even on that speed , will take us forty years to get there . If we are heading for planet , our solar system , and it will crash into it very soon . If it is an outer planet , Pluto , Uranus , we still have a few hours . But if it 's Mars , Our time 's already up . It 's not Mars . The Red Planet ! We 'll bypass it by a million miles or so . Anna . I 'm going to start running through those circuit combinations by trial and error . it would take too long ! Not if you can eliminate some of the permutations mathematically . if only we had computer . - I will try - Good . In the meantime , I 'll run as many combinations as possible . Jack Check the inner gravitational field . Thank you . Jack ... Saturn . I 've been observing it for the past ten minutes . We 're in a dead collision course . Not collision . The waves of Saturn 's atmosphere are so immense ... that long before we hit anything solid ... this ship will be crushed and compressed to the size of a baseball . Afraid our time 's run out . Anna . It will collide ? Yes . I have reduced problem to four circuits . Numbers 4 , 16 , 22 and 51 but they must be activated in proper sequence But I do not know which sequence . There are 24 different possibilities . Let 's try all of them . They must work systematically Sequence one : open circuits 4 , 16 , 22 , 51 In that order . 4 ... 16 ... 22 ... 51 All circuits closed ! 4 ... 16 ... . 51 ... 22 4 ... 51 .. 22 ... 16 We 'll never make it . Keep going ! 16 ... 22 ... 4 ... 51 ... 16 ... 22 .. 51 ... 4 ... We 're back on manual . My god , we 've done it . We 'll be hinting the atmosphere in just a few seconds . I don 't know how much heat this craft will stand . Better start decelerating . On it . Ready ? Ready . Now . Something dropped . We 're losing power . We should lose power , shouldn 't we ? Not like this . Recheck those circuits , quick ! - Right We 're burning up ! We have to decelerate . hit the power Feeling better ? Where are we ? In the Swiss Alps . Fred and I were thinking We 'd like to try for landing in Geneva . Both our countries have embassies there ... and it can be put on record that we did this together . That is , if it 's agreeable to you - Yes , yes . You know , when the world sees this ship Everybody is going to have to realize there are other intelligent beings in the universe . And we 'll have to meet them face to face one day . All the nations of this earth better be ready to stand together . Amen . Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha !

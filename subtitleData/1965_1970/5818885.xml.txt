 [ somber organ music plays ] P.A. : Attention , please . Attention , please . Mr. Hamilton ? Yes ? [ train signal clangs ] Scarsdale is next ! Scarsdale is next . [ engine starts ] Good day ? Mm-hmm . You ? Very productive . Got the roses out in back all trimmed . Oh , letter this morning from Sally . Sam 's finished internship . Starts practice next week . Well , he should specialize . That 's the only thing now . Well , maybe he just wants to get the feel of things . Our little girl 's done all right . Is something wrong ? No . That phone call last night ... What about it ? I heard you pacing around in the study afterward Till almost 2 : 00 . Just a crazy prank . Look , Emily , it was nothing . [ ring ] Man : Art , it 's me again . Arthur ? Arthur ! Look , I don 't know who you are , but- - Charlie Evans . Stop saying that . Charlie Evans is dead . Now , I want you to stop this Or I 'll be forced to call the police . Art , there are 2 trophies on the fireplace Near the tennis team picture . Pick up the phone and walk over to them . Go ahead . You know the cord will reach . Are you there ? Yes . In the picture , You and I are standing with our arms around each other 's shoulder . We 're both wearing the same kind of a wristwatch . Remember we gave them to each other After winning the doubles in Princeton ? Yes . Ok . Take the doubles trophy there and turn it over . One edge of the felt is loose . Pull it back . Charlie : Fidelis " eternis . " You scratched it there Down in the locker room after we won the finals . Remember ? With your belt buckle . I had ... I had forgotten . I didn 't . It can 't be you . Ok , now , listen very carefully . Did you get the address today ? Yes . Good ! You 're to use the name Wilson . You--you can 't be Charlie . You just don 't come back . I 'm alive ! More alive than I 've been in the past 25 years . You 've got to come tomorrow . Arthur , listen , if you don 't show up , that 's it . Think , for Pete 's sake . What have you got now ? What ? I don 't know . Tomorrow . Just past noon . Remember , use the name Wilson . I ... Don 't know . I won 't call again , buddy . [ click ] Charlie ? Charlie ? Is it that call again ? No ! Stop cross-examining me every time the phone rings . Understand ? Perfectly . I 'm , uh , sorry . [ belches ] Excuse me . You 're excused . Any fever ? Just old faithful . Make an appointment to see Dr. Hogan tomorrow , hmm ? I will . Promise ? Promise . Thank you . Therefore ... In view of the differential ... Between your present equity ...

Uh , " should your equity ... " Oh . Should your equity increase , Do not hesitate to call on us For a personal reappraisal . Et cetera , et cetera . Standard closing . Yes , sir . [ buzzer ] [ bell jingles ] Uh ... My name is , uh ... Wilson . I was told to ... I was told to come here . Look , is this the place or isn 't it ? They aren 't here anymore . I got it wrote down . Thank you . Move it ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Move it down the line ! Let 's go , you bunch of idiots ! Get that beef cut down ! Move it up ! Damn , let 's get that truck going ! Get the meat the hell out of here ! Get going ! What are you going to do , take all day ? Come on , move ! Don 't let those hooks fall off on you ! Come on . Let 's move it ! Ok , Johnny , get us a truck . Get us another truck up here ! Tighten up with it now . Let 's go with the load ! Ah , Mr. Wilson . Let 's go ! On the truck with them ! Come on ! Surely this isn 't the , uh ... No , sir . Please come with me . Let 's go , Frank ! Move that truck off ! Come on . Let 's hook it off ! Hook off ! Don 't just stand there ! Move that beef off the line ! Let 's go ! What are you , a bunch of jerks ? Come on . Go ! Go ! Come on . Get it down ! Cut it ! Cut it ! All right ! Come on ! Move out ! Keep moving that beef ! Cut it down ! Let 's go ! [ saw cutting ] Would you step in , please , sir ? I 'd much prefer to ride in front , if you don 't mind . I 'm sorry , sir . Customers are asked to ride in the back . Oh . Your hat , sir . It 's only a short ride . Thank you . We 're here , sir . Would you take the elevator to your left , sir ? Ah , Mr. Wilson . Will you come this way , please ? Yes . I 'm very sorry . There 'll be a short delay . Perhaps you 'd like some tea and a sandwich . Thank you . All right . Make yourself comfortable . Oh . Here we go . Uh , pardon me . Could you tell me the way out of this building ? Excuse me . I was wondering if you could tell- - Excuse me . I 'm trying to find ... Excuse me . I 'm trying to find my way out of the building . I have a gentleman here who wishes to leave the building . Woman : Yes , that would be Mr. Wilson . Would you have him return to Mr. Ruby 's office , please ? Mr. Ruby is waiting for him there . They want you down at the end of the corridor again . Yes . All right . Thank you . Ah ! There you are , Mr. Wilson . Come in . Please . Would you close the door ? Please , sit down . My name is Ruby . I 've been assigned to go over the circumstances of your death with you . What ? Oh , I know this seems rather strange to you . That 's why I 'm here . You probably have a lot of questions . Of course , the subject might appear indelicate , But most of our clients- - Let 's get this straight . I am not a client . Precisely , Mr. Wilson . You are not a client yet . Let me start by explaining the cost factor involved . To begin with , The procedure 's a rather complex one . This seems to be your supper . The chicken looks delicious . No , thank you . Yes , as I was saying , The cost runs in the neighborhood of $ 30,000 . I know this seems rather high , But in addition to the rather extensive cosmetic renovation By way of plastic surgery for you , C.P.S. has to provide a fresh corpse that perfectly matches , uh ... Your physical dimensions and medical specifications . C.P.S. ? Oh , cadaver procurement section . You sure you don 't want this chicken ? Absolutely sure . Oh , pity . The next step is the carefully planned Obliteration of identifiable portions of the cadaver Before it is found : Features , dental structure , fingerprints ? We can 't leave anything to Chance . No , I--I guess not . Oh , would you mind if , uh ... Please . Thank you . Now , there is a problem That the circumstances of your death Must be simple . Well , a simple accident , strangely enough , is costly , Mr. Wilson . The trick lies in obliterating just so much and no more So that ... An identification still can be made Based on , as I say , general dimensions Plus a credible sequence of ... Events , Witnesses , et cetera . Oh , the whole thing must be very carefully staged . We guarantee a death of this kind . Mmm , excuse me . Delicious ! They have a wonderful way of baking cheese on it So that 's it 's very crispy . Now , there are any number of ways you can be found . Excuse me . I mean your body can be found . The victim of some kind of machinery , An explosion , Um , a hunting misadventure . Oh , but I think these are somewhat too gross for you . I had thought perhaps a hotel room fire . Would you like me to outline the circumstances ? No , thank you . Oh , good . I--I was hoping you would , uh , agree- - No ! I mean , I--I can 't be sure . Oh , of course , of course , of course . We can 't expect you to decide all at once . Uh , think it over . There 's so much else to be done , Mr. Wilson , But if I may say so , The question of death selection May be the most important decision in your life . Oh , here are the trust instruments , Mr. Wilson . Mr. Joliffe , Mr. Brown , Mr. Wilson . My colleagues . Now , this is your , uh , revised will , Drawn in accordance with the requirements of the trust , All predated , of course , to save you the trouble . Oh , no , no . It 's standard procedure . Ah . Effective at the time of your death , The trust provides for very liberal settlements on your wife and daughter And more than sufficient funds for your financial needs In your new identity , Uh , from sums assigned to us as your , uh , trustees . Insurance policies , Uh , annuities , Real estate . If you 'll , uh , sign right here . [ whispering ] the staging here Is rather authentic . You 'll see . Of course , the drug made it easier to manipulate you Into the proper positions and attitudes . Rest easy , Mr. Wilson . You did not ravage our girl . Of course , the photography is not too professional , But I think it 's clear enough . So now it 's- - I have a message from Charlie . Charlie ? He wanted me to tell you that rebirth is painful . You were going to say so now it 's blackmail , eh , Mr. Wilson ? What would you call it ? Just kind of insurance . Is it easier to go forward When you know you can 't go back ? But you knew that , didn 't you ? The minute you hung up on Charlie after that first call . Ah , sure , you did . You 're saying ... I can never go back ? The fact is , you really don 't want to go back . Sakes , boy , you owe yourself this thing . Rebirth , life again . Begin again all new , all different , The way you always wanted it . You got another Chance . Heck , nobody 's going to miss you , are they ? My wife . What about her ? What are you to her now ? We get along . What does that mean ? There 's my daughter . Hmm . We don 't see much of her actually . She lives out west with her husband . She writes now and then . Let us ... What are you to her now ? You excuse an old fool prying , son , But what does it all mean ? Hmm ? It can 't mean anything now anymore . There 's nothing anymore , is there ? Anything at all ? I ... Expect to be president of the bank before too long . I have my boat in the Summer . We have friends . Anything at all ? Guess I ... Never thought much about it before . I leave Emily pretty much alone to do what she , uh ... We get along , as I said . We hardly ever quarrel . Not that that 's any Measure of our lives . Frankly ... During the last few years , we ... Hardly ever ... Ever ... I--I ... I don 't know why I 'm telling you this . 'cause you want to . Go on . Ever ... Ever ... Showed much affection . But as I said ... Boat ... And , uh ... So this is what happens to the dreams of youth . Go on , son . Let it out . Nothing to be ashamed of . Let it out . Hmm ? Time for a change . Now , look , they 'll both be well taken care of . They don 't need you and you don 't need them . You just can 't help each other anymore . Now , look , son , you know what I 'm saying is true . There 's nothing anymore . No , no . Now , what you need now is a good rest . Now , a few things to be worked out in the morning . My boys will clear those up , And you needn 't worry none . The boys ? Uh-huh . You are the head of it all ? There never was a struggle in the soul of a good man that wasn 't hard . My papa told me that , and it 's sure enough true . Believe me , son . I know . I believe you . That 's fine . [ snipping ] You know , Mr. Wilson , You represent something of a milestone around here . When the bandages are removed , I think you 'll be more than pleased . In fact , I expect you to be prancing around here like a stud bull . Now , this is going to take a while , So try to be patient Till we get you ready for the world again . [ incoherent uttering ] Now , don 't do that ! You can 't talk because we 've extracted all your teeth And given you a complete vocal cord resection . Give the tissues time to pull together . Now , you got a new set of permanent teeth . In a week , you won 't know the difference . Thank you . That 's what hurts most right now . Everything 's different ! When the first healing 's over , We 'll start conditioning for muscle tone , hmm ? [ uttering ] Yes , yes , those , too . Fingerprints . Mr. Wilson , even your signature . A little thing we did with the tensor ligaments of the hand . The orbicularis oris started to sag , So we tightened them with ligatures . Yeah . Then we worked on the mandible to square up the bone . Uh-huh . Well , I never . Holy mackerel , I don 't know how you boys do it . Doc , it 's a masterpiece . Good work ! Old man : Easy does it . You 'll be all right , son . Your scars and hematomas Will disappear in a couple of weeks . After several months of physical conditioning , The process will be complete . Ah ! My name is Davalo . I 'm your guidance advisor . This is about your future career . I 'm afraid I haven 't thought very much about that . Oh , yes , you have , sir . Permit me . Arthur : I want a ball . A big , big red one . Whoops ! I 'm afraid we picked this up a little too early . Sit down . We recorded these regressions Under pentothal and caffeine sodium benzoate . At first , there 's always a touch of the infantile , But later on , we progress to a more mature , Expressional infrastructure . Ah . Here we are . Davalo : What would you like to do most of all ? Arthur : Of anything in the whole world ? Mm-hmm . Uh ... I 'd like to be a tennis pro , I guess . Yes . That 's what I 'd like best of all . Uh-huh . And suppose you couldn 't be ? What else would you choose ? Uh ... I guess I 'd like to paint stuff . Pictures ? Pictures ... And things ... Well , I think the creative wish pattern is pretty self-evident . You mean I ... I ought to be a painter ? Exactly . You see , painting allows you a basic creative outlet , As well as providing an environment In which these sublimations will have free vent . Now , let 's take a look at the program we 've worked out for you . Certificates of study . Abroad . Notices of first 6 one-man shows . Your pictures ... Are realistic in treatment But deal with poetic imagery in choice of subject . Not that I pretend to be a critic of painting . Ha ha ha ! These diplomas ... From reputable universities , They ... They can 't be forged . Mr. Wilson , I assure you , Every item is bona fide and valid . How can I even approach such a professional level ? I couldn 't- - Very simple . You are already established in a position of some dignity . Nothing conspicuous , Just a solid , mildly successful sort of thing . You will be supplied with fresh paintings periodically . In time , you 'll perfect your own style- - Surreal , primitive , impressionistic , whatever . It will be a transition from this present work . You see , you don 't have to prove anything anymore . You ... Are accepted . You will be in your own new dimension . You 're a bachelor . Birth certificate . The only son of deceased parents and so forth . In short ... You are alone in the world , Absolved of all responsibility , Except to your own interest . Hee hee hee ! Isn 't that marvelous ? Davalo : Your studio is in Malibu , California . Quite luxurious . Very private . You 'll make your own adjustment In your own way , in your own time . Oh , you 'll be self-conscious at first . Don 't worry . Hee hee ! It will wear off . And remember ... You 've got what almost every middle-aged man in America would like to have : Freedom . Real freedom . Hee hee hee ! Ah , it 's been a pleasure , Mr. Wilson . Woman : Pillow , Mr. Wilson ? Yes , thank you . Man : Tony ! Tony ! Tony Wilson ! Tony Wilson ! Hey , there , you old rascal ! Slow down ! Where 's the fire ? Can 't wait to get back to them pretty little models , huh ? Uh-oh . I am late . If I didn 't have to catch me a plane , I 'd make you buy me a drink , by God . See you , soon . Gotta run ! Man : Welcome home , Mr. Wilson . My name is John . I 've been assigned to help you . It 's very nice . I think you 'll be quite comfortable , sir . Do you like your studio ? Yes . Perhaps you 'd like to freshen up And have a drink . Afterward , I 'll try to clear up any point On which you may have curiosity . The bath is through here . I 'll unpack these for you later . Thanks . Um ... How long will you be here , um ... John , sir . For as long as you need me . The company is fully aware that you may have problems at first And will spare no effort to help you solve them . Thank you . Yes , sir . John . Yes , sir ? I , uh ... I had a curious experience at the airport . What was that ? Well , I was accosted by a man who called me by name . He seemed to know me , and I 'm certain I 've never met him . I suppose it was a mistake on his part . So it would appear , sir . What kind of people live here ? Professionals . Some in business , some write . No , uh ... No artists , I hope . I think you 're the only one , sir . If I may suggest , sir , Perhaps you 'd like to give a small cocktail party For the immediate neighbors . Oh , well , I , uh ... I 'd better get myself used to things first . Later on , maybe . As you wish , sir . That 's very good , sir . Thank you . Wouldn 't you enjoy meeting some of the people here , sir ? I told you I 'm not ready yet , John . I 'll do this in my own way and in my own time . Of course , sir . Hello . Hey ! Hey , wait ! I 'm sorry about back there . How about if we try it again ? Hello . I 'm Nora Marcus . I 'm ... Tony Wilson . Walk ? Sure . Ha ha ! Ocean , I love you ! You 're beautiful ! Beautiful ! All that power , and she 's got all the answers . Hey ! Got a question ! Ahh ! What did you ask ? Oh , a tough one . Who and what is Tony Wilson ? And what did it say ? It told me to mind my own business . Nora : That was my life- - 2 boys , ages 10 and 12 , Successful and indulgent husband , A beautiful house complete with microwave oven , Intercom , station wagon , et cetera , et cetera , Ad infinitum . Ad ... Absurdum . And ... I made myself a cup of coffee , Dressed , and left . That was 4 years ago . And you never went back . I 've seen them from time to time , But ... It 's different now . Maybe because ... I 'm different . I don 't expect you to understand . I think I do . You ? An artist ? Why should you understand ? You 've spent your whole life being . You don 't know anything about me , really . Yes , I do . It 's all right there in your face . What is ? Ah ha ha ha ! Now you 're fishing . No . Seriously . This may hurt a little . I agreed to take my chances . Ok . Madam Marcus will read the leaves . What kind of a man is he ? There is Grace in the line and color , But it doesn 't emerge pure . It pushes at the edge of something still ... Tentative , Unresolved , As if ... Somewhere in the man ... There is still a key unturned . That 's quite an analysis . Not really . When you come to think of it , It sort of fits everybody . Doesn 't it ? I don 't know . It 's very nice here . The good things always happen with the rain . When will I see you again ? I 'm going to Santa Barbara tomorrow . There 's a kind of gathering . Can I come ? Ha ha ha ! It 's going to be very wild . Maybe that 's part of ... Turning the key . [ playing festive music ] To the God pan . To the gods of this place ! Drink ! See ye , you gods ! March down upon this procession and bless us all ! The Queen of the wine ! Aye !

This is your host Mr. Wilson . Mr. Filter , Mr. Wilson . Nice to meet you . How do you do , Tony ? You have seen Tony 's paintings , haven 't you ? Cheers . Mr. Wilson , may I present Mr. Mayberry . Oh , hi . Nice to meet you , Mr. Wilson . Peek-a-boo . Woman : Mr. Wilson . Honey , please slow down . Never ! Never ! Come . I 'm taking you to " ze " casbah . Ohh ! Not the casbah . As soon as these people leave , I 'm going to attack you . Why , Mr. Wilson , you dirty old man . Ah . I really am . Mmm . I want you to know that . I 'm counting on it . Miss Marcus , you shock me . Tony , please , ease up . Uh-uh . Why ? Because ... It 's not like you . Oh , I know that . I 'm sorry . [ sighs ] Guess I just needed the added strength . That 's silly . They 're all wonderful people . Just give them a Chance . Ok . Give yourself a Chance . Ok . Yes ? I promise . No more . And I promise ... To behave myself . [ gasps ] Ohh ! I 'm sorry . Forgive me . I 've embarrassed you . No , you haven 't . Tony ... I think ... I love you . You 're beautiful . You 're ... You 're an ocean . Let 's go back . The sooner we get rid of those people , The sooner we can be together . I 'm going to hold you to your promise , Mr. Wilson . God , you 're evil ! Yes ! God ! How evil you are ! Ha ha ha ! Tony ? Henry Bushbain , my husband . Nice to know you , Wilson . Nora , you 're staggering . Oh , that 's a dirty lie . Watch out for this character . He 's a lawyer . Harvard . I want you to know . Really ? Hey , that 's a coincidence . Thank you . Mmm . Me , too . In fact , me , too , twice . Hollow leg again ? Oh , will you listen ? At home , he makes me look like a piker . A veritable piker . Henry , you sneaking two-face , you . Ha ha ha ! Private joke ? No , I--ha ha ha ! Come on , Nora . Let 's ditch these two sots . [ gasps ] Help ! Tony ! Hey , wait a minute ! You can 't do that ! There 's no way you 're gonna get away . You 're gonna stay right here . But that 's my woman . Hey ! Hey , that 's funny . That 's very funny . What 's funny ? Is he really a sneaky two-face ? Ha ha ha ! Yes . Ha ha ha ! There 's such a religious climate out here . Don 't you agree ? Oh , love the climate . I belong to a special kind of group . Nothing subversive , I hope . Oh , good heavens , no ! We change sects . I beg your pardon ? Oh , no , no ! That ... You thought I meant- - " sects . " s-e-c-t-s . Ha ha ha ! Oh , sects ! Yes . Well , thank God . We change every month . Right now we 're in Aztec . Huitzilopochtli , quetzalcoatl , Virgin sacrifice and all . I just love your paintings , Mr. Wilson . How do you ever do it ? Well , you see ... It all began with a big red ball . Uh ... No , no . You see ... I paint naked , Mrs. Filter . It 's the only way to get at the truth . How interesting . Of course ! See , in this way , my inner Essence is revealed , And I am presented to the canvas In direct relationship to my primeval state Without its sociological trappings . Mr. Filter : Hey , watch it , will ya ? ! Oh , look ! Take it easy , Wilson ! I 'm terribly sorry . You all right , hon ? John ! John ! That 'll never come out . Never ! I 'm terribly sorry . It 's ruined ! Please forgive me . Just look at this mess ! May I ? Let me take that . I 'm sure it won 't stain badly . We 'll get it all cleaned up . Hey . Have you two heard the one about the- - Yes , we have . Yes , we have . Oh . I 'm--I 'm--I 'm sorry . I--I--I didn 't mean to interrupt . Seems like I 'm doing everything wrong lately . Now don 't pout . Mama will make everything better , ok ? Perfect . Say , hank , Uh , I was thinking about school just before , And , uh , your house at Harvard wasn 't by any Chance Adams , was it ? Adams , well , no , not exactly . Is anybody hungry ? I am . Say , hank . Hank . Ha ha ha . Hey , hank , here . Hank , actually- - Actually I 'm not a Harvard alumnus , either . That is , I used to be , but I 'm not anymore . Woman : What do you mean ? Did you resign or something ? Oh , that 's priceless . No . I did go to Harvard , you see . Uh-huh . And I was an alumnus , But that was before I became a painter , And now I 'm not anymore . Come on , hank . % realize hopes we 're dashing % % into blue obscurity % % resistless our team sweeps goalward % % with the fury of " ze " blast % % we 'll fight for the name of Harvard % % till the last white line is passed % That 's wonderful . Absolutely wonderful . Truth is , I just stopped being an alumnus . Oh . Simple . Wilson . What ? You and I must play golf sometime . Ha ha ha . Golf ? Golf ? Ha ha ha . Antiochus Wilson playing golf ? Ha ! Now ... Arthur Hamilton . Ha ha ha . Looks as if our host is in orbit . [ Wilson laughing ] Hey , wait a minute , you guys . Wilson : Incoming . Don 't drop me . Bye ! Oh , isn 't he wonderful ? Hey , wait a minute . Hey , wait . Turn around . Hey , hey , listen . Hey , hank , I got a nephew . I got a nephew right- - right in Harvard right now . You don 't have a nephew . Wilson : What ? Ha ha ha . I don 't have a nephew ? Ha ha , huh . Ok , you 're right . I don 't have a nephew . But he 's there , all right . He 's there , all right . My daughter ... She 's married to a doctor , And maybe by this time I 'm a grandfather . Believe me , they 'll never drag it out of me . I 'll stand right here On my constitutional rights . I am not a grandfather . I ... Why are you all staring at me like that ? Ha ha . Hey , John- - Ha ha ha ha ha . Hey , John . Why- - Hey , John- - Hey , John , Why are they staring at me like that ? They know . They know what ? They 're like you . What do you mean ? Reborns . Oh , Nora ! Shut up , you ! Shut up ! Shut up , damn you ! Just who the hell do you think you are ? Oh , no . Oh , my God . [ ring ] [ ring ] [ ring ] Yes . Charlie : It 's me , buddy . Now listen to me , Arthur . Charlie . Now look , Arthur- - Charlie . Arthur , listen to me . Is it really you ? Of course it is . Do you realize how dangerous it is , what you 're doing ? Do you ? I 've gotta get out of here . You don 't know what they 're doing to me . Come on now , buddy . Calm down , calm down . I 've got to see you . That 's impossible right now . Why ? It just is . Now , you 've got to get ahold of yourself , fast . You 'll be sorry- - Know what they did ? I can 't explain , but you 'll be sorry . There 's this reborn , Nora . She 's not one of them . She works for the company . What ? That 's right . An employee . Oh , but I ... Oh , no . She was so ... Well ... Why , Charlie ? Why ? Your adjustment was bound to be difficult in the first stages . Don 't you see ? The company simply provided- - An employee . It means a lot to me , personally , Arthur . I can 't explain , but we 're sort of tied together , you and me . We 're so close , Arthur . Don 't throw it away . How ? Trust , please . I want you to promise to stay put until we can get someone to you . Charlie : You 've got to have some help right now . Please , will you do it ? Will you stay there ? Please ? Yes ? I 'm Mr. Wilson . Yes , sir . Come in , please . I 'll tell Mrs. Hamilton you 're here . Emily : Mr. Wilson . I 'm so glad you were able to come . Thank you . I didn 't mean to barge in . Oh , not at all . It was very kind of you . I must have sounded strange over the phone , but ... You see , Arthur never mentioned- - Well , I just met your late husband last year , Shortly before- - Yes . Um , please , sit down . Mrs. Hamilton , I 'm a painter . An artist , actually . I admire your husband 's watercolors . Really ? Not that he was professional , But he did have something . He mentioned some paintings in a cupboard Out in the garage . That 's the reason I- - Well , I was wondering if I might pick one up as a memento . I 'm sorry , but the garage has been cleaned out . You threw them away ? No . No , not exactly . You have a lovely place here . Oh , thank you . This was the study , wasn 't it ? Yes , it was- - How did you know ? Your husband ... Talked a lot about this house . About his family . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to stir up painful memories . No , no , it 's not that . It 's just that ... I never knew Arthur to do that very much . How do you mean ? I don 't want to bore you . No , please . I 'd like to know . You see ... I knew him only for a short while . I 'd really like to know . It 's not just curiosity . We , uh ... We shared an interest in art . The last time I saw him , I--I did some sketches . Now I 'd like to do a painting ... But all I have are lines , a face . Posthumous portraiture . I 'm not joking , Mrs. Hamilton . No , of course you 're not . I 'm sorry . I- - Well , you 've set me quite a task . He was a quiet man . I think that the thing I most remember him for were his silences . It was ... As if he were always listening to something inside- - Some voice . He never talked about it , So I never knew what it was . Oh , he was a good man ... But he lived as if he were a stranger here . I mean , he never let anything touch him . Became absorbed in things . His job , mostly . He worked hard , He became more detached . Always a look around his eyes As if he were trying to say something . I don 't know what . Protest against what he 'd surrendered his life to . I never knew what he wanted ... And I don 't think he ever knew . He fought so hard for what he 'd been taught to want . When he got it , he just grew more and more confused . The silences grew longer . We never talked about it . We lived our lives in a polite , celibate truce . See , Arthur had been dead a long , long time Before they found him in that hotel room . Well , I ... I guess I can 't tell you much more . Enough ? Yes , it is . I really should be going . Well , I hope I 've been some help . Yes , you have . Very much . Emily : Mr. Wilson . You said that you wanted a memento . It won 't be a painting , I 'm afraid , but it 's all I have . I 'm sorry , Mr. Wilson . It doesn 't matter . I want to go back . Of course , sir . No , I don 't mean California . To the company . Start again , all over . Antiochus Wilson can die , can 't he , John ? The company ... Is it possible ? I think so , sir . Begin again . Quite honestly , I 'm not the least bit sorry , Because there were certain mistakes made in my case , and they- - Of course , but before we go into all that , Let me ask you whether you can recommend and sponsor a new client . What ? Well , someone in your acquaintance outside Whom you feel would benefit by the company 's services . You were sponsored yourself , you know . Oh , yes . Of course . A business associate , perhaps . Someone down the street . Well , you don 't have to be intimately acquainted with a man To realize he 'd be receptive to the sort of opportunity we offer . I 'm sorry . Right now I just can 't seem to- - Well , what I mean is , I--I 'd like to think about it . Well , that 's all we ask . As you can imagine , our business is acquired through present clients . It 's a word-of-mouth operation , Wilson . You don 't suppose we can advertise in magazines and newspapers . No , of course not . I think you 'll come up with something . Man : Hold it . Thank you . Hold your arm up , please , Mr. Wilson . That 's it . Excuse me . I don 't understand . Is all this really necessary ? 13 1 / 2 . Profile . Turn sideways , Mr. Wilson . Wait just a moment . Is this necessary ? Hold it . Hold it . That 's it . Uh , back view . What is this ? Preliminary for surgery , or- - Certainly , Mr. Wilson . A year has gone by . A lot happens to the human body in a year . This one is yours , sir . Hello , Arthur . Excuse me . I don 't believe I know- - It 's me , buddy . Fidelis " eternis . " Charlie ? You 're Charlie ? Guess I am , old buddy . What are you doing here ? Same as yourself , waiting . What 's the matter ? Oh , nothing . It 's ... It 's just that it 's hard to recognize somebody and ... Not recognize them at the same time . How long have you been here ? Oh , a while . When you phoned me , you were here ? Mm-hmm . Even the first time ? But you sounded ... Like the whole thing was something tremendous , This rebirth , Everything , even when you hadn 't made a go of it . I thought you 'd have a better Chance . Well , good God . How long does a man have to wait to get into surgery ? Not long usually . I had to stay around and telephone you if necessary Through your first adjustment , but now ... That 's what you meant about our being tied together . Mm-hmm . I couldn 't help it , Charlie . I had to find out where I went wrong . The years I 've spent trying to get all the things I was told were important , That I was supposed to want . Things . Not people ... Or meaning . Just things . And California was the same . They made the same decisions for me all over again , And they were the same things , really . It 's gonna be different from now on . A new face . A new name . I 'll do the rest . I know it 's gonna be different . I suppose you do , too . [ buzzer ] Good morning , gentlemen . Mr. Carlson , please . Charlie . You ? Art , I- - Mr. Carlson , Please . Charlie . I have the feeling you 're gonna make it this time . Sorry to disappoint the rest of you . Perhaps tomorrow . You don 't seem to understand our problem , Mr. Wilson . I understand it perfectly . But you 're not cooperating . I 've told you over and over again . I cannot think of anyone . I can 't believe that . Mr. Ruby , I 've been shuffled around enough . I think it 's about time I had the opportunity To start living some kind of meaningful existence . If I did sponsor someone , Wouldn 't that delay my trip to surgery In the event that I were needed from time to time To , say , advise him ? No , that 's not likely . Not if the selection is a good one . I 'm sorry . I don 't seem to be able to think of a single soul . You mean you deliberately won 't . Have it your way . Very well . That 'll be all , Mr. Wilson . You can go back to the day room . Processing , please . This is Ruby . On , um , Wilson , 722 , I think we can go to the next stage now . Hello , son . Well , sir , I ... Uh , you know , I sure hoped you 'd make it , Find your dream come true . What ? I said I sure hoped that you 'd make it , Find your dream come true . I guess I ... I guess I never had a dream . Maybe that 's it . That--that sure might have been it . If I did have one ... It certainly wasn 't Antiochus Wilson . This time , I 've got to be allowed , sir , to make my own decision . You know , son , When I began this business , I was a young man with an idea . I wasn 't aiming to make a lot of money helping others . Help ' em to find a little happiness . Oh , heck , just not the rich . I thought eventually- - See , I got tremendous comfort in the thought that in my small way I was waging a battle against human misery , And I was , too , Except we do have a high percentage of failures . I guess that 's to be expected , But it hurts me . Some reborns make a go of it . We 're always working to find ways to improve the system . Yeah , we make mistakes . Fact is , when our clients first started to come back here , I just wanted to chuck the whole thing , but I couldn 't . The organization was pretty big by then . Uh , board of directors On a profit-sharing basis . All those people . You 've no idea what a financial responsibility it turned into . Heck , we make mistakes , But we admit ' em and go forward . I won 't see it in my lifetime , But some of the younger execs like Ruby may . Oh , you can call it wishful thinking , son , But life is built on wishes , And you gotta just keep plugging away at ' em . You can 't give up , And you can 't let the mistakes jeopardize the dream . [ door opens ] Well , here 's your transportation . Surgery , sir . But I 've gotta talk to you . Sir , we 're on a very tight schedule , please . Why , I--I didn 't expect--so soon . It 's efficiency . You 're lucky we got a match so quick . Hop aboard , son . Up there . The doctors are waiting . That 's just so you won 't fall off . But there 's things we have to talk about . I mean , my identity and all . We will . We will later . Just relax , son . Everything 's going to be fine . Just fine . The thing about doing it on my own . You see , it 's so important . Choice . You 've got to change . We have to talk about it . We will . I 'll look into it personally . Just remember , son , We got to keep plugging away at the dream . The mistakes teach us how . It wasn 't wasted , remember that . My name is Dr. Morris , sir . According to our records , Uh , you were reared in the protestant Faith . Did you convert to any other During your adjustment ? No . Good , good . That is , good in the sense That we have a certain definition . Now , I am not suggesting that being a protestant Is any better than being a catholic or a Jew . As a matter of fact , I am qualified to care for you In either of those faiths as well . I was ordained in each : Rabbi , priest , and minister . I admit it unusual . Uh , maybe a bit advanced . Wait a minute . What 's happening ? Well , my good sir , uh , when we have finished , You will go on to the next stage . I don 't mean that ! Ultimately , Mr. Wilson , Ultimately we 'll be called to face the creator And render up our last account . It happens to all of us , sir . That 's no answer ! I want to know what 's happening to me now ! Don 't shout , please ! No ! [ muffled ] aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! " blessed shalt thou be coming in . " and blessed shalt thou be in going out . " and he said ' thou canst not see my face , For no man can see me and live . ' " " requiem et lucem obtineat perpetuam . " Aah . Aah . Aah ! Aah ! " meque cum illis gratia tua coronet aeterna . Per dominium . " " I am the resurrection and the life . " he that believeth in me , " though he were dead , shall yet he live .

" Rex gloriae libera animas Omnium fidelium defunctorum . " Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah . God be with you , sir . Aah . Aah . Aah . What 's his data ? " Wilson : Mesomorph , age 51 . " no current diseases . " requisitioned from day room stock may 6th . " released for cadaver use last night . " C.P.S. Number 722 . " disposition : " death by automobile accident Caused by cerebral hemorrhage . " All right . Acid etch . Yes , sir . What 's the solution strength ? 5 % of 10 ccs . Timer . 5 minutes . You were my best work , Mr. Wilson . I 'm sorry it all has to end like this . All right , set him up . I think we 'll put the hemorrhage Right under the left exoccipital In the lingual gyrus . Put that light over here . Good . All right . Relax , old friend . Cranial drill . [ drill whirs ] [ drill whirs ] { { { the end } } }

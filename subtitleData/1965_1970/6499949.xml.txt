 ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) ( Thunder booming ) Prisoner : Where am I ? Man : In the village . What do you want ? Information . Whose side are you on ? That would be telling . We want information . Information ... Information ... You won 't get it . ( Bubbling ) By hook or by crook , we will . Who are you ? The new number two . Who is number one ? You are number six . I am not a number , I am a free man !

Eh ? A road . Where is there a road ? Ah ... ( Speaks ) Thank you . ( Responds ) Man ( On police radio ) : Just going down ... waterline now ... Um , towards , uh ... ( Radio chatter continues ) ( Police siren sounding ) ( horn honks ) Man : Hold it ! ( Taps knocker ) Yes ? Who owns this house ? I beg your pardon ? I , I 'm sorry . What I meant was , I ... I 'd like to see your master . My mistress is not at home . D-do you mind if I wait ? ( Car engine revving ) What 's the number of that car ? Terribly interesting . K-a-r 120-c . What 's the engine number ? Do tell me . 461034 t-zed . Marvelous . I know every nut and bolt and cog . I built it with my own hands . Then you 're just the man I want to see . I 've been having a good deal of overheating in traffic . Perhaps you 'd care to advise me . Come in . Thank you . This way . ( Clock chiming ) Make yourself at home . And I 'll organize some tea . You would like some tea ? Very much . I 'm Mrs. butterworth . And you are ... ? An exile . A nameless exile ? Uh ... Smith . Peter ... Smith . Enchanting . Be comfortable and I 'll be back in a moment . And then you can enlighten me on the intricacies of k-a-r 120-c . ( Dial tone ) ( Door ape-hf ) Refreshments on the way . Now tell me more . What 's the date ? Saturday , march the 18th . Tomorrow 's my birthday . You 're an odd fellow . Yes ... you , uh ... You must think I 'm crazy . Who isn 't these days ? You know this , uh ... This was my house . Really ? Yes . In better days ? Before I went away . You must miss it . The lease , uh , had six months to run . Well , it 's been renewed . I have it for ten years , fully furnished . Oh , yes ? Is the inventory in order ? I 'll bet . The only thing that 's missing is a body . Don 't tell me you 've been prying into my private affairs . Forgive me , I 'm very sorry . Uh ... would you do me a very great favor ? Are you growing a beard ? No . Pity . I 've always had rather a soft spot for bearded men but I could never get dear Arthur to grow one . Arthur ? My late husband . Navy , you know . Unhappily , now deceased . ( Knock on door ) Come in . Oh , thank you , Martha . Is this the , um , gentleman you said called earlier ? It is , madam . Her description of you was hardly flattering . Mr. Smith . You must learn to delve beneath the surface , Martha . Who knows what treasures you may find ? All right . Thank you , madam . Come and sit down , Mr. Smith . Sandwich ? Thank you very much . You 're very kind . It 's a pleasure . That was the best fruitcake I 've every tasted . I 'm a very good cook . It 's one of my hobbies . Yes ... Mrs. butterworth I asked if you 'd do me a very great favor . Certainly . Behind this desk , there was an area of dry rot which was made good about twelve months ago . The bathroom door is sliding . It opens to the left . The sink is on the right as you go in . The hot and cold taps on the shower were put on the wrong way round . ( Laughs ) I had them changed . Don 't be so silly . You haven 't got to prove anything . I believe you . I 'm sorry , I 'm not used to that . What can I do for you ? I would like to see the lease of the house and the log book of the car . How mysterious . Thank you . This is a new one . Yours is the , um , the first name on it . There 's no indication of the previous owner . The estate agents arranged it all . They said the car was for sale , it was reasonable and I 've always had a taste for a little speed . Yes . The , um , estate agents were stumbell and croydon ? Most reputable . And a charming man who dealt with me . Mr. croydon himself . Did you ever meet him ? No . That wasn 't the firm that I did business with . How odd . Yes , indeed . Mrs. butterworth , you 've been extremely kind in allowing me to intrude upon your privacy in this way . I have to make two important calls one in the country , one in town so if you 'll please excuse me , I 'll say good-bye . Mr. Smith , you mustn 't . I 'm sorry , I have to . You mustn 't go like that ! Some of ... Dear Arthur 's things . You 're very welcome . I 've kept them all , you see . I suppose it 's stupid , but ... Even though there isn 't a man about the place I like to feel that there is . Do you understand what I mean ? Yes ... I just know you 're in some kind of trouble . Have you any money ? No . Well , there you are , you see ? How are you going to get about ? It 's all right , I can manage ... Don 't be so silly , and independent , and proud . Come on upstairs . You 'll find everything you want in the bathroom and I 'll lay some of Arthur 's clothes out for you . On condition you stop that nasty overheating . It 's a deal . Bon voyage . Mrs. butterworth , you 've been tremen ... No speeches , off you go . ( Starts engine ) Don 't forget to come back . I 'll be back ! I might even bake you a birthday cake . Anyone at home ? Pretty spot . Mixture of architectures ... Italianate . Difficult ... certainly has a mediterranean flavor . What do you think , thorpe ? I think I wouldn 't mind a fortnight 's leave there . Prison for life , eh ? Far cry from sing sing . I 'm sorry to interrupt an afternoon 's golf , colonel but this is not a joking matter . My dear fellow , you really mustn 't blame thorpe . After all , you yourself on occasion could be ... A little skeptical . That 's why you were such a good man . Why we were so sorry to lose you . The evidence is there . A set of photographs from ground level of a holiday resort . And a schoolboy navigational log on the back of what you call the village newspaper . I 'm sorry , it 's the best I could do in the circumstances . You 'd hardly expect the village store to issue sextants , would you ? Indeed , indeed . If the place was as you said it was . " The tally ho . " A daily issue . Morning or evening ? Daily at noon . " What are facts behind town hall ? " Town hall ? That 's right . Town council ? Correct . Were you a member ? I could have been . It 's democratically elected once a year . Democratically ? That 's what they claim . And they 're all ... numbers ? No names ? No names at all ? Just numbers . I see . Numbers in a village that is a complete unit of our own society . A place to put people who can 't be left around . People who know too much or too little . A place with many means of breaking a man . Intriguing . They have their own cinema their own newspaper ... Their own television station ... A credit card system ... And if you 're a good boy and cough up the secrets you are gracefully retired into the old people 's home . But , uh , no escape ? They also have a very impressive graveyard . Which you avoided . The village was deserted . Perhaps they were on the ... Democratic annual outing . The town hall ... Number two 's residence ... My house ... My dear fellow , you really mustn 't get excited . You must forgive us , but you see , we have a problem . Tell him our problem , thorpe . You resign ... You disappear ... You return . You spin a yarn that hans Christian andersen would reject for a fairy tale . Colonel : And we must be sure . People defect . An unhappy thought , but a fact of life . They defect from one side to the other . I also have a problem . I 'm not sure which side runs this village . A mutual problem . Which I 'm going to solve . Quite . If not here ... Then elsewhere . Thorpe ? Sir ? Check . Yes , sir . Check every detail contained in our ... Ex-colleague 's report . Of course I helped him . I 'd help ... anyone in trouble . Wouldn 't you ? Never mind . Keep checking and report when you have anything . All corroborated apart from the boat . The beach ? Gypsies . Romanies . What about the roadblock ? Nothing to do with you , my dear fellow . An escaped convict . Can 't you give us anything more on the boat ? No name ? Would you advertise if you were gun-running ? No , I would not . I most certainly would not . Would you , thorpe ? No . You satisfied ? Let us say that the dice are heavily loaded in your favor . All right , let 's get to work . Commander , how 's it going ? On the basis of your log and allowing for the variance of your primitive device and the laggard speed of your craft I estimate you would have averaged some three and a half knots . Yes ... Assuming fair winds . You had fair winds ? Mostly . You appreciate there is no allowance for tides . No , there couldn 't have been . I had no charts nor any means of assessing them . Precisely . You slept for how long ? Four hours out of each 24 . Remarkable . So , in your 25 days at sea you proceeded at an average of three and half knots for 20 hours out of each 24 on a northeasterly course which would put us at , uh ... Four hours sleep , 20 hours under fair sail maximum travel on a true course ... 1,750 Miles . Where was the lighthouse ? Here . 250 Miles to the inch . That is my maximum possible travel . Minimum would be , commander ? I 'd be inclined to allow at least 400 Miles differential . Call it 500 to cover drift and tide . Yes ... on a northeasterly course in an equitable climate ... Somewhere about here . Coast of Morocco ... Southwest of Portugal and Spain . It might be an island . You 've got 500 by 1,500 to sweep ... 750,000 square Miles . Quite an area . The clearance has just come through for refueling in Gibraltar . Good . Then we 'll sweep as far as we can today and then again tomorrow ... And tomorrow , and tomorrow ... You 're a stubborn fellow , number six . James , you call me that once again and you 're liable for a bout in hospital . I won 't be a minute . Good luck . Thanks . ( Engine whining ) Interesting fellow . He 's an old , old friend ... Who never gives up . Turn . Sweep back 15 degrees southwest . Sweep nine degrees southwest . That could be it . Go closer . There it is . We 've found it . That 's it . Be seeing you . ( Gulls sawing ) ( Percolating ) ( Cat meows ) Many happy returns . ( March playing ) ( Slam echoes )

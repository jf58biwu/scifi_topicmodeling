 One thing I love is a warm welcome . Yeah , so do I. Where do you think we can find one ? Let 's try the saloon . I like the way you think . I 've heard of people being stoned , but this is ridiculous . Everything 's in place , except the bets . There 's no money . Yeah . You 'd better go check the till . Right . Completely cleaned out . Not a thing in it . On the house ? Well , thank you . Don 't mind if I do . Maybe it 's some new kind of poison . I just remembered I don 't drink . Same story in there . Customer , storekeeper , and the money 's gone . And the same in the blacksmith 's shop , only with a hammer . Ugh ! Safe 's blown wide open . An expert job , too . Jim , this man 's eyes are moving . Don 't touch him . He 's alive . Maybe they 're all alive . It 's very difficult to explain , Governor . The paralysis comes on quite suddenly , and the whole body becomes rigid . The effects last for about 48 hours . Do we know what causes it ? No , sir , we don 't . It could be a new poison . A colorless gas , for instance . My partner 's working on it now . Well , what are the aftereffects ? Ow ! Be careful , you idiot . All the people seem to have recovered . The entire town of Willow Springs was paralyzed , yet there was just one fatality , an older man . It could have been from some other cause . I suppose I 'll have to investigate . Oh , we 've already done that . We hope the autopsy will show us what sort of problem we 're up against . What about the missing money ? Not a trace . Not a clue . If there were any tracks , the wind took care of that long before we got there . All right , Roscoe . You 've practiced enough for today . Now get back to the butcher shop . You seem to be taking this rather calmly , sir . Before you come tomorrow , Roscoe , do sharpen that razor . You must have been chopping kindling with it . You 're quite wrong , Mr. West . I 'm not at all calm about this . But , uh , just because I live among savages doesn 't mean I have to act like one . Do you know how I became governor of this territory ? It beats me . Well , apparently , I offended some rather powerful political figures . This is my punishment . This office is my prison cell . A bird in a gilded cage . But I intend to make fools of my persecutors , Mr. West . I intend to do such an outstanding job that I will return to Washington in triumph . Best of luck . I understand you are a man of many accomplishments , many skills , Mr. West . I know how to shave myself . I don 't mind impertinence , Mr. West . It shows spirit . And you 're going to need lots of it . This is a wire from the President , instructing me to keep you and Mr. Gordon on this case until the looting of Willow Springs is solved and the money returned . We were expecting that . Possibly you were . But , as it happens , the President contacted me , not you . So , as your superior , let me tell you one thing , Mr. West . Unless I get prompt action on this case , immediate action , I will nail your brilliant and accomplished reputation to the wall . What is it , Hobson ? Sorry to bother you , Governor , but we just received an incomplete request for help from Sand Hills . We can 't seem to raise the telegraph agent there . Can 't raise the agent ? Did you hear that , West ? Do you think there 's any connection ? Well , answer me . Sir he 's already gone . About your teeth ... Hey . Oh , Dr. Kirby ! Well , I 'm certainly glad to see you , sir . I 'm happy to be of help . The , uh , federal authorities are really quite grateful to you for having volunteered , sir . Well , from what I 'd heard about this , I couldn 't afford to pass it up . Now , let me see . Uh-huh . What is it , Doctor ? Oh , it 's exciting . It 's a real challenge . I 've , I 've , I 've never seen anything like this before . What 's the matter ? I don 't know . Not ... not enough rest probably . I 've been up all night looking at these medical books , trying , trying , trying to make some sense out of this . Oh . Have you any theories so far ? Yes , I have . Here , look . In there ? Yes . This slide is a bit of tissue taken from the victim . It 's been stained to show the nerve endings . Oh , is that what those little blue dots are ? Mm-hmm . Th-That shows that the nerves have been attacked by some ... some toxic substance . What 's wrong , Doctor ? Muscles ... stiffening . What can I do ? Tell me what to do to help you . I must have been infected in the autopsy . I need an injection . Where is it ? I 'll get it for you . In the bag ... under the table . Ya-hoo ! Our new technique sure makes our work a lot easier these days , don 't it , Lafe ? Hey , looky here . It would be just like shooting clay ducks at the fair . Hold it . You know the orders . I used to think you ran this gang , Coley . That 's why I joined up with you . Anytime you think different , you can try me . All right . Time to ride . ... six , 37 , 38 39 , 40 , 41,000 . Not bad for a small-town bank . Not bad . Look at that . All right , where 's that sack from the Express Office ? There it is there . Sweet , sweet money . I love it . Mmm . All that money . Know what I 'm gonna do with this ? $ 300 ? A lousy 300 ! That 's all ? Who cleaned out the Express Office ? I did . Why ? Now , Frank , it would certainly pain me if I thought you were going into business for yourself . Say what you mean , Coley . Spit it out ! I 'm saying maybe you put all the small bills in the sack for us and all the big ones in your own pocket . That 's a lie . Only one way to find out . Hand over your wallet , Frank . Frank , your wallet . What 's the matter with all of us ? Do we have to let him ride up and down our backs ? Hey , now , Coley , Frank wouldn 't do nothin ' like that . Maybe that express agent was down at the bank for a deposit or something . Hey , come on . Let 's have a drink and be pals . Forget about it . Come on . Up to you , Frank . Get his wallet ! O ... Over a thousand dollars , you liar , you ! Oh , please ! You ... you are not one of them . That 's what all the trouble 's about . What do you want ? Out . Which way ? The desert is too open . They 'll see you if you run . They 'll see me if I stay . Come . I hide you . No one will search the tower . They are afraid . Afraid ? Those men don 't frighten easily . By the way , what are you doing here ? Check the tower , Lafe . Not me . I 'm not going up in there . I 'll do it myself . Quickly , inside . I know how you feel . We 're in the same fix . We can 't find him anywhere . Not a sign of him . All right . Lafe , you and Whitey patrol outside the wall . Sam , Jeff , you help the men on the sentry post . Whoever he is , I don 't think he got away . He 's bound to make a break for it before sunup , and that gives him one hour . Think maybe it 's about time we moved our hideout ? Move ? What are you talking about ? This place is perfect . Besides , we 've got all our equipment here . It wouldn 't be so easy to move . Yeah , well , we 've been talking about that . Maybe it 's about time we got ourselves clear of the doc and his ... ooh , his bugs . You 'd rather go back to shooting it out on every job ? You never had it so easy . Besides , we 've hardly scratched the surface . We 're going to clean out this whole territory . Look , Coley , we made a couple of real good scores , but the truth is , the boys and I are just plain scared of that crazy doc . Nobody - nobody - knows what that guy 's gonna do next . You leave the doc to me . All any of you gotta do is take orders , unless there 's somebody else here who wants to go into business for himself . All right , boys , you heard him . Let 's do what he says . Now , please , I know you 're hungry . Please eat . Mr. , um ... West . My name 's James West . Do you do this for all the strangers that happen to wander in ? I , uh , I need help . I 'll do anything . Well , that gives us something in common . I must get my father out of here , away from the gang , and the killer who runs them . I think you 'd better tell me everything about your father and his experiments . You believe me ? How could you possibly lie to me ? My father was a student of the great Dr. Lister , the man who followed Pasteur in proving that many disease are caused by tiny bacteria . You understand ? The germ theory . I 've heard of it . After his studies with Lister , my father went to China as a medical missionary . It was there he met my mother and I was born . He was the great hero with my people there . He helped heal many hundreds . What went wrong ? There was a plague . Thousands of people were ill , including the wife of the ruler of the province . My father treated her ... but she died . The ruler blamed him . As punishment ... he killed my mother . He drove us out . Destroyed my father 's reputation . Took away his license to practice medicine . That was his life . So , now he breeds new types of bacteria . He has developed a germ that can paralyze . Well , why does he let the gang use this germ for their own purposes ? He doesn 't know what they 're doing with it . He 's their prisoner . They are putting it in the main water supply of the towns they loot . Jim . When do they plan the next job ? I don 't know exactly . I only know that it is soon , and that they intend to kill everyone in San Francisco if they have to . You be extra careful . I 'll be back as soon as I spread the warning . ♪ ♪ Hey , Coley , we caught him . Coley ? We got him . Governor , I 'd like you to issue an immediate warning to all the towns in the territory . Watch the sideburns , Roscoe . All water supply should be guarded 24 hours a day , and no new shipments of food should be used until further notice . Easy ! Don 't just hack at me . Governor , I think you should request federal troops to quarantine all outbreaks of illness . Governor , do you hear what I 'm saying ? Shout , Mr. West . How could I not hear you ? I 'm telling you that you have a full-scale emergency . And unless you act quickly , millions of innocent people could die . Yes , yes , and on the strength of what some ... Stop it while I 'm talking . On the strength of what some idiotic hysterical girl told you , you want me to create a panic throughout the whole territory and make a fool of myself in Washington . Just because of some wild story about germs . What did Artemus and the doctor learn from the autopsy ? Learn ? Nothing . The doctor , if there was one , vanished . And , uh , Gordon turned up with a concussion . What ? Where is he now ? I have no idea . He staggered out of bed to go and search for you around Sand Hills . Oh , it 's been a comedy of errors , and in my opinion , you 've both have been totally incompetent . Roscoe , you 're here to shave me . Now , Governor , you and I are going to have a serious talk . Do you believe I tracked the gang from Sand Hills to their hideout ? I believe you tracked the gang from Sand Hills to their hideout . And do you also believe that they have a germ culture that causes a paralysis in the towns that they loot ? Paralysis in the towns they loot . And I 'm sure you believe that they have a new and deadlier germ which not only paralyzes , but kills . Yes , but kills . What are you going to do about that , Governor ? Do just what you said . Issue a warning to guard all water and food supplies . Do just what you said . Now you 're making sense . I 'm going back to the fort , get Arty , the girl , and her father . I could send some men with you . No , no , we can 't attack in force . They 'd kill Artemus before I got to him . I 'm going alone . Whatever you say . Now we understand each other , Governor . You do exactly as I said , or when I come back , I 'm going to give you a much closer shave than that . I brought you some playmates . I figured they might help you to talk . Well , thank you . It 's right friendly of you . Yeah , and they 're hungry . Very hungry . Now , you see this ? Bacon . They love it . They won 't be able to tell you from the real thing . You know , my memory 's starting to come back . What was it you wanted to know ? What brings you out here . Nothing , I told you . Just stumbled onto the place . It 's on the way to nowhere . Just where I was headed . You know , there 's one thing you ought to know about these pets . They 're not feeling so good . Oh . Nothing serious , I hope . Maybe . May be fatal . You see , they got the germ yesterday . They should be loaded with it by now . You sure are a persuasive man . So , let 's hear the truth . All right , I was headed here . To hide out . I got into a scrape in Virginia City . Shot a man . The law took out after me . What about the other man ? The one who ran ? I didn 't see anybody else . I was walking over to the fort when everything busted loose . Uh-huh . You know , there 's one thing I know for sure about you , friend . Hmm ? That you 're a rotten liar . Stop it ! What are you doing ? You know the doctor forbids anyone to take his animals . Well , I wouldn 't let them eat enough to hurt him . Turn this man loose . Ah , you take care of your pets . I 'll handle this character . Care to watch ? You . You staged that whole autopsy . Of course I did . The moment I learned there was to be an inquiry , I made myself available . You hear that ? Ah , it 's just a coyote howling . Are you going to bet ? Yeah , I 'm going to bet it 's not a coyote . Come on . Aw , every time I get a good hand . Oh , yes , I see them now . Little stick shape things , wiggling . Not really very pretty . If you knew the scientific genius that goes into breeding a new strain of bacteria , Mr. Gordon . You 're the second person in the world to see that germ . That 's very flattering . Why should the honor fall to me ? Because you have a brain . Ah . Even if it is in a rudimentary state of development . Not like those cattle down below . I see . You want somebody to brag to . All right , tell me about that , uh , new bug of yours . What 's so good about it ? That is the most dangerous bacteria the world has ever known . Mm-hmm . I 'm going to call it , Bacillus Kirbyensis . It 'll make my name immortal in medical circles . If that 's fame , Dr. Kirby , I 'd rather die unknown . Well , it is fame , Mr. Gordon . Many great researchers have given their names to diseases . Yes , but they were working for mankind , not against it . Yes . I spent , uh ... I spent years trying to save mankind . And what was my reward ? They killed my wife . They robbed me of my profession . And so now I 'm going to give them what they understand . Death . Why ? So scum like Coley Rodman and his gang can loot the world ? No , no . No , no . They ... They think they 're using me . They are , Dr. Kirby . You 're nothing but a weapon in Rodman 's hand . Well , we shall see . I , uh ... I have certain plans . Oh ... What was that ? The natives are restless . Stop it . Not in the lab . Hold it ! Get ... Get out of here ! Get out ! What are you doing in here ? I 've warned you . You are not to come in the laboratory . I 've told you a hundred times . You 're not to be here ... Jim ! You know him ? I ... Yes , Father . Who is he ? Where did he come from ? He-he 's a friend . He wants to help me , help us . Help us into prison , maybe . He 's the spy that was here before . Now I know how he managed to stay out of sight . No . No , you wouldn 't do such a thing . Anna , t-tell me you didn 't hide him . You will inject these men with my new culture . Hey , Coley , why don 't we just shoot ' em and get it over with ? No , if the doc 's new germ 's all he says it is , they 'll be dead by morning . Kind of worth waiting to find out . Come on . Let 's go . Arte , can you move ? I don 't want to try . I 'd hate to be disappointed . I 'm glad Anna didn 't really stick us with that needle . Yeah , well , she 's a nice girl . I can 't say much for her father . Well , so this is where they keep the rest of the menagerie , eh ? Who ? Show a little respect , you know ? I could be your uncle . Who had the picnic ? Oh , that 's the food Anna brought me last night . Oh , you stay here often ? Mm , maybe once too often . Hey , Jim , I just thought ... what do you suppose 'll happen when we don 't die on schedule ? I imagine they 'll give us some help . Just give me the stuff , and let 's get moving . No , I told you that 's no longer the plan . Look , Doc , maybe it hasn 't sunk in yet , but that 's the plan . The town 's waiting to be knocked over , and me and my friends - we just happen to be businessmen . You know , you 're like some little termite gnawing at the bark ... when , with one swoop , you could fell the entire tree . I 'm not trying to get rid of the whole human race . I figure if we knock off $ 40,000 , $ 50,000 a week , we 're going all right . Money , money , money ! That 's all you think about . And all you think about is killing ! I don 't mind shooting a man , but ... I don 't ... I don 't see the sense in wiping out hundreds at a time . Hundreds ? Thousands . Hundreds of thousands . You know , Doc , I-I think you 're getting a little near the edge , you know what I mean ? I 'll take that new bacillus to San Francisco . In three days , I 'll wipe out that entire city ... and then you can loot till your greed chokes you . You mean that ... the germ will ... kill everybody that fast ? In the morning , you 'll have proof . The experiment will be complete . Mr. West and Mr. Gordon will , uh , no longer be among the living . It 's solid . Don 't move ! I don 't remember ordering a new suit . Ah , it 's a portrait . Wonderful way to spend an afternoon . Well , it 's very nice , but I don 't think you 've captured the real me . Ah ... Just a pinch of salt . Ah , yes . Now that 's the real me . A regular Rubens . That 'll cost you ten . I 've about had it with that loony doc . I 'll see that and raise you . It 's time to get rid of him . Yeah , I guess so . It 's about time . Yeah , good , good . We 've been thinking we can 't stick around here forever . Somebody 's bound to come looking for those two guys sooner or later . All right , then , we 'll clear out , then we 'll hit Silver City on our way south . Yeah , and what about the doc ? Will he give us the stuff to fix up the town ? Don 't worry about Doc . I 'll take care of him . And the girl ? I 've got plans for her too . All right , come on . Let 's pack up the loot . Whitey , you go up to the storage room and take care of the two men . All right . All right , come on . Let 's move . Lafe , now . Aw , Coley , every time I get a good hand ... You get Anna . I 'll get the doctor . It 's impossible . You 're dead by now . I 'm afraid your little bug 's fallen down on the job , Doctor . No , I ... I checked them ... rechecked . You failed , Doctor . Now come with me . I only want to help you . Help me ? How ? I know some good doctors . They 're the ones that 'll help you . They 'll help me ? No , no . They sent you here . They want to see me destroyed . They want to see my work destroyed . They 're jealous of me ! I wonder what happened to Whitey . If you don 't care about yourself , what about your daughter ? No ! My work ! You 'll ruin everything ! Stop it ! I 'll kill all of you ! Okay ... okay , don 't shoot . You pick up Kirby 's body and carry him outside . Now ! You , get up and help . According to the public health service , there 's no further danger of an epidemic . Then both Willow Springs and Sand Hill will be back to normal . Thank Heaven for that . Yes , your father 's discovery was quite an accomplishment . Oh , it , uh , may prove useful someday , maybe as an anesthetic . I 'd like to think some good came of it . Poor Father . He started out wanting to help people . Maybe in the end , he did . I hope so . Now it 's time to think about you and a new life in San Francisco . San Francisco ! Wonderful town , San Francisco . You 'll love it there . As a matter of fact , once we get there , I 'd like to hang around just to make sure you do . Oh , you 're very kind . John and I 'll be glad to have you join us . John ? My fiancé , John Chang . When he heard what happened to my father , he-he wired to meet him in San Francisco . He is wonderful . Oh , wonderful . Mm , marvelous . But , of course , we can be good friends . Friends . Friends . What 's that for ? John Chang . Oh , of course , John Chang . How could I forget John Chang ? Hmm ? Cheers . Oh . Of course . Cheers .

 ( tires squealing ) ( whinnying ) * * Hi . This is Dr. Rogers , Dr. Frederick Rogers . There 's been an accident up on Highway 14 . A woman was thrown from her horse . No , I 'm afraid she 's dead . Yes , uh , her name is Laurie Keller . K-E - double L-E-R . That 's right . I 'll bring her in , all right ? All right . What do you want ? Let go of me ! Let go of me ! No ! ( gasping ) What are you doing ? ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Stop ! Why are you doing this ? ! NARRATOR : Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent . The invaders ... alien beings from a dying planet . Their destination ... the earth . Their purpose ... to make it their world . David Vincent has seen them . For him , it began one lost night on a lonely country road looking for a shortcut that he never found . It began with a closed , deserted diner and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey . ( eerie whirring ) It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy . ( whirring intensifies ) Now David Vincent knows that the invaders are here . That they have taken human form . Somehow , he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . The guest stars in tonight 's story : Antoinette Bowers , Jason Evers . ( tires squeal ) NARRATOR A physician reports the death of a woman . Two hours later , her husband , a NORAD major , reports her very much alive . The newspaper account attracted no particular attention , but David Vincent knew that an alien , unconscious , without pulse or heartbeat , might easily be mistaken for dead- - even by a doctor- - and so he arranged to visit NORAD 's Combat Operations Center , 1,400 feet beneath Cheyenne Mountain , and a natural target for the Invaders . Over there , please . Yes , sir . Robert Davis . You 're a freelance magazine writer ? That 's right . It 'll be just a few minutes , Mr. Davis . Would you step over there , please ? Thank you . Excuse me , please . You were right about Robert Davis , sir . He 's David Vincent . Let him take the tour with the others . Yes , sir . These tours for journalists are designed to publicize our defensive capabilities . We want the public- - and our potential enemies- - to know about this facility . Naturally , you won 't see anything that 's classified , but I can promise there 'll be plenty for you to write about . ( electronics beeping ) Morning , Major Keller . General . How 's your wife , Major ? I read about that accident up in the mountains . Oh , she 's fine now , sir , thank you . I think she was more concerned about what happened to that doctor than she was by her fall . Terrible thing . That 's the last of it . We 'll be able to install the new tapes as scheduled at 0900 tomorrow . ( electronics beeping ) Officially , this is the War Room . To us , it 's the peace room . What you 're looking at now is a composite picture of the aerial activity and the approaches to the North American continent . Each object in the sky must be identified and accounted for . The key to the entire operation is the computer section . On its reliability rests the defense of the North American continent . Now for a closer look at the big screen . Naturally , the final decisions are made by men . Beyond the electronic logic , no matter how advanced , there is always a human brain . This is the computer section . As you can see , we 'll have to pass it up . Uh , Captain , are any of the section personnel available for interview ? You , uh , might be able to arrange something through the Public Information Officer . Thank you . * * ( doorbell rings ) Hello . Mr. Davis ? Yes . I 'm Major Dan Keller . How do you do ? Come on in . Thank you . The PIO phoned . Said you wanted to do a piece on the home life of a NORAD officer . Something like that , yes . Uh-huh . My wife Laurie will be down in a minute . Good . Drink ? All right . Uh , scotch and soda . No ice , please . Fine . Make yourself comfortable . Thank you . You 'll , uh , forgive me for not joining you , Mr. Davis , but I have to get back to work . I really don 't have too much time . Here you are . Thank you . Donna , my first wife . She died six months ago . It was a heart attack . Oh , yes , I realize you 're running short on time . Just a couple of questions . Uh , the second Mrs. Keller , Laurie ? Is that right ? Mm . Good . How long have you known her ? Three months . What does that have to do with anything ? Well , I thought the PIO explained to you that ... No , the PIO said you wanted to know about my home life . To me , that means meals , hobbies , schedules . You want to know about my personal life . Why ? Major , I 'm not a journalist . I 'm trying to find out about a plot against NORAD involving the computer section . I can assure you , Mr. Davis , our security is excellent . But not foolproof . Why don 't you talk with A2 ; Intelligence ? I intend to talk to them , but I wanted to talk to you first . Why ? There are a couple of things I wanted to find out about the second Mrs. Keller . What exactly are you getting at , Mr. Davis ? My wife . Hello . Hello . I thought I 'd make you both some lunch . Mr. Davis was just leaving . Excuse me . I 'll see you again . What was all that about ? Oh , this guy really came up with quite a story . He ... Oh , never mind . It 's ... nothing . ( honks horn ) ( honking horn ) ( honking ) ( honking louder ) ( honking ) ( tires squealing ) * * * * These so-called aliens of yours , why hasn 't NORAD spotted their spacecraft ? Major , I don 't know , but they 've been moving single saucers without detection , and this could involve something much more important . ( intercom buzzes ) Send him in . Thank you for coming down , Dan . I thought I 'd find you here , Mr. Davis . His name is not Davis . It 's David Vincent . That 's right , the one with the UFO theories . I knew who he was this morning , Dan . I didn 't interfere with him because I wanted to know what he was doing at NORAD . Well , you don 't buy his stuff , do you ? Look , Dan , I spent five years in UFO investigation . There are plenty of unanswered questions . Sit down . Dan , Mr. Vincent has a theory that ... Laurie may not be what she seems to be . Oh , well , you know her so well , Mr. Vincent . What does she seem to be ? Maybe you could explain why Dr. Rogers called the state police to tell them that Laurie was dead . Well , she was unconscious . He made a mistake . A doctor with 30 years experience ? Is that likely ? More likely than flying saucers . And right afterwards , Dr. Rogers drowned . Oh , I can 't explain coincidences , Mr. Vincent . Then let me try . Suppose there are aliens here on Earth without pulse or heartbeat . One of them is knocked unconscious after a fall from a horse . Now , you can see how a doctor mistakenly would ... Just a minute , mister . Mr. Vincent , are you saying that Laurie has no pulse or heartbeat ? Ask the major to bring his wife to the base . Have your own doctors examine her . Pete , I 'm tired . We 're programming tomorrow . Major Keller . What was your wife doing alone at dawn in the mountains ? She grew up with horses . She likes to ride . Well , you said you have an open mind . Bring her in . I don 't have the authority to do that . And I can 't force her to take a medical examination . Okay . I 'll see you later . ( door opens , closes ) ( laughing ) What 's so funny ? That guy that was here today ? Mr. Davis . Oh ... His name 's not Davis . It 's Vincent , and he goes around the country preaching about aliens from outer space with no pulses or heartbeats . I don 't think that 's funny . I think it 's rather sad . Hmm ? Huh . Do you know what he said about you ? You ... are an alien being . ( laughing ) ( laughing ) Yes , he did . You are a heartless alien being . * * * * We were talking about the area southwest of Alaska . Southwest of Alaska . That is within the NORAD defense perimeter . For 3000 miles . Which reels of tape are programmed to detect objects entering the airspace over the islands 1,000 miles southwest of Alaska ? Reel nine . Only reel nine . How could that tape be reprogrammed so as not to see 20 spacecraft approaching those islands ? Objects entering airspace at one degree in fixed trajectory at 2,000 feet per second per second ... * * * * Reprogram this . What ? Laurie ? ! Laurie ? ( groaning ) We 've put in the blind spot . Will you be able to get this to NORAD in time ? My husband will see to it . Is the attack still scheduled for tomorrow morning ? 10 : 22 . * * ( groans ) ( men approaching ) ( engine starting ) Dan ? I 'm over here . Why aren 't you in bed ? For one thing , I 've got a headache . Well , I have something to fix that . Where were you ? Well , I hope I didn 't worry you , darling . Of course I was worried . It 's 4 : 00 in the morning . Is it really ? I just couldn 't sleep , and I thought I 'd try my old standby- - a ride in the mountains . Here . Take this . You 'll feel much better . It was so beautiful up there tonight . The air was so clear . The stars were so bright . I think I 'll pass . I feel drugged already . Drugged ? I had a nightmare . Part of the human condition . And I felt as though my brain were being scooped out of my head . I looked all over the house for you . You weren 't there . Well , I 'm here now . Come on . Let 's get some sleep . Laurie , I don 't want you to go out riding again in the middle of the night . Dan , I 've done it all my life . Well , you 'll stop doing it now ! Why is it suddenly so important to you ? Do you think I 'm meeting a man out there or something ? I 'm going to bed . Laurie . I want your word ! My word for what ? That you won 't go out riding again alone . What do you think you 're doing ? Is that what 's on your mind ? Do you think I 'm what he said I am ? Some sort of creature ? ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Laurie . It 's just ... just sitting here in the dark ... Sorry . You had a nightmare , darling , that 's all . A nightmare . Don 't let 's fight anymore . I 'll be back in a minute . And , this time , I won 't leave you . I promise . Thanks a lot . David Vincent . Then I cut cross-country . I got to the highway , hitched a ride here . If there 's anything up there , our patrol will find it . ( intercom buzzes ) Oh , yes . Send him in . Morning , Dan . What 's he after now , Pete ? I think you 'd better hear him out . General Winters ? We 've installed the new tapes . Thank you , Captain . What makes people like you so dangerous , Mr. Vincent , is that there 's always a grain of truth in what you have say . Obviously , you went driving last night , and you happened to see Laurie . Well , then she was out ? Well , I don 't know what time she left the house , but she came back at 4 : 00 . Surely you have enough now to bring her in for questioning . ( intercom buzzes ) Yes ? Oh , yes . Tell him to come right in . Excuse me , sir . The patrol just reported back . Oh , yes . Go on . The shack was empty . Dusty . No sign that anyone had been near it for years . This doesn 't prove anything . They 're experts at this kind of thing . All right , Captain . Thank you . Yes , sir . Sorry to have bothered you again , Dan . Major . Look . You 're an Intelligence officer . In any other case , you 'd try to consider every possibility . All I 'm asking is that you try to do that now . I 'll bring her in , Pete . If you want to , Dan . It would help clear things up . I 'll see you in a half an hour with Laurie . Major ? If she knows why you 're bringing her in , she won 't come . She 'll be here , Mr. Vincent . You should take a detail of air police with you , Major . I don 't intend to arrest my own wife . Laurie . Dan . What are you doing home at this hour ? How would you like to see the inside of COC ? Today ? Uh-huh . Right now . Whatever brought that on so suddenly ? Well , actually , I thought the two of us might have a talk with Pete Stanhope . The Intelligence officer ? Whatever for ? It 's not about that alien thing again , is it ? Oh , Dan , I hope you didn 't tell Pete I was coming . Well , I didn 't think you would object . It 's not Pete Stanhope at all , is it ? It 's you . Something 's troubling you . That argument last night ... Is it Donna ? Do you feel guilty about marrying me ? You think that I trapped you into marriage with some sort of witchcraft ? Oh , Dan , I love you . ( sobbing ) : Do aliens cry ? Oh , Laurie , I 'm sorry . Forgive me , darling . I don 't know what I was thinking about . If it means that much , I 'll come with you . I just don 't want you to worry . I don 't want you to worry at all . Come get me . ( phone rings ) ( ringing ) They must be on their way . Maybe . ( groaning ) He 'll be here . Unless they finished with him . Unless ... unless he served his purpose . Conners , I 'm coming right over . I want a complete rundown on everything Major Keller did since he arrived at the base this morning . Laurie ? I only saw him for a minute , sir . Then he went to your office . Did he say anything to you ? He instructed me to replace the computer tapes . That was a routine replacement ? Yes , sir . It 's been scheduled for three weeks . What time did he arrive here at the computer section ? I 'd say ... 8 : 58 . He entered the vault at 8 : 56 and stayed about a minute and a half . It takes a few seconds to walk here from the vault , so that accounts for the time . Except for what he did while he was in the vault . I 'm sure he was checking on the tapes . We hadn 't completed them when he left last night . Last night , Mrs. Keller brought something out in a saddlebag from that shack . Could it have something to do with the tapes ? Laurie ... What happened to me ? Nothing , darling . You just fell asleep . Whe-where are you going ? Going for a little trip . We talked about it . Don 't you remember ? No , Laurie . I ... I don 't want you to ... to go . ( breathing hard ) It 's ... true . ( sighs ) It 's true . Why ? We need a base here , an island . At 10 : 22 , we 'll have it . ( gunshot ) * * * * * Major ... Stanhope . Just a second . It 's Major Keller . Yes , Dan , what is it ? Reel ... ( door opening ) ... nine . Dan ! Captain , take a detail and get over to Major Keller 's house fast . I think he 's been shot . Yes , sir . What did he say ? ( door closes ) Reel nine . A computer program . Is there any way a reel can be altered to make things look normal even if they 're not ? I don 't understand . Can a computer be fixed ? Can it be made to ignore a specific phenomenon and nothing else ? Yes , I suppose so . How ? An instruction could be added to a tape . All it would take would be one extra card in the right place . Then you 'd get something on the memory bank like ... " If objects approach at a certain speed " on a certain course , forget it . Don 't project it . " Could that be it ? Major Stanhope here , General . We may have discovered an error in the computer programming . Thank you , sir . They 're switching to the backup computers . ( warning tone ) What 's happening ? We 've got an automatic Condition : Red . ( Klaxon blaring ) ( warning tone ) Whatever they are , they 're not air-breathing engines . ( warning tone ) There should be visual contact within two minutes . We have to intercept them . ( warning tone ) They were warned . * * Major Stanhope , please . ( telephone ringing ) Stanhope here . Oh , yes , Captain . No , Captain , that 's all . Major Keller is dead . What about Laurie ? She left a " Dear John " note . ( knocking ) Come in . Oh , thank you for dropping by , Mr. Vincent . I 've been trying to make some military sense out of what happened , Just personal speculation you understand . Yes , sir . Some of it 's pretty hard to swallow and still keep your peace of mind . The general 's preliminary report on the Condition : Red . He explains the UFOs as natural phenomena . It 's says nothing here about the changes in the computer tape . The general feels that Major Keller was worried about his private life , and that he , uh ... simply made a mistake . And how do you feel ? There was some talk around the base that Dan married Laurie too soon after his first wife died . I suppose you could say he did make a mistake . Good luck , David . Stick with it . I plan to . For my peace of mind . So long . NARRATOR : The Invader has lost a battle , but David Vincent knows that somewhere in space new strategies are already being devised ... for the war has only begun .

 BATWOMAN Look ! Another murder involving one of Acapulco 's athlete 's has occurred . The body of the wrestler ' El Rayo' was found drowned at the beach , This is the fifth murder commited by a mysterious killer who has yet to be caught . The police are incapable of solving these crimes , which are scaring the population . These liberal newsreaders have no consideration for the case itself . There 's no motive , no clues , nothing , NOTHING ! Similar crimes were comitted some time ago in Macao and Hong Kong It seems the cases are all related , so , the FBI have comissioned to us - a special agent in order to track the killer here , to Acapulco . - Yes ? - Mr. Mario Robles is here , inspector . - Tell him to come in . This is the special agent . - Hello - Hello - Sit down . - Thanks . - How are you my friend Robles ? Do you bring me good news ? - Yes inspector . Since our last conversation , I 've talked with someone who can help us , - whom I 've solved some cases with before . - Batwoman ! - Yes sir , I 've told her the whole story and she is willing to help us . - Great ! - Who is this woman ? - Don 't you know her ? - No . - She is very difficult to describe with words , She is a wonderful and very rich lady who lives in the capital city . She uses her vast fortune to fight against the forces of evil .. , Thanks to her special abilities , she is distinguished in all sports .. , And , behind the mask , she 's become a great wrestler . - This Batwoman , is a great woman . - It will be a pleasure meet her . You will only see her mask , because if the HAMPA finds out , she will be eliminated . Only one other and I know her real identity and we 'll guard the secret with our lives . As a wrestler , she will be able to infiltrate the wrestling scene and begin inquiries - without being noticed , as it seems that wrestlers are the targets of our killer , for some special reason . - I talked to her manager so he can prepare some fights here , in Acapulco . - Great idea ! - When will she arrive ? - Tomorrow , at noon . The case must be complicated because they called Batwoman . - Note this down . - The autopsy papers , inspector . - What did you find , doctor ? - Like the other wrestlers , Pineal gland juice has been extracted surgically . - So the assassin must be a medic ? - An extraordinay surgeon . See this ... - As you can see , there 's a little cavity in the victim 's cranium where they used a small tool , leaving nothing but this small mark . - Why is this evil medic doing these interventions ? - I really don 't know . We know little about the human body , and less of this gland . - Then , there 's nothing we can do . - Nothing , but wait till the killer makes a mistake . - Another crime ... - Igor , have you prepared the lab ? - Yes , master . Good . Remove the lid . Seal the tank . Increase the preasure to 20 ATM . - We have 20 ATM , Dr. Williams . Quickly , Igor , there 's a leak . - I 'm on it , master . - Perfect ... NOW ! No reaction ... Igor , we have to do a new experiment to create our fish-man . - When ? - NOW ! As soon as possible , We need another wrestler so we can obtain more gland liquid for the transplant . - But now is very dangerous , the police ... - Shut up ! - Success is near . We can 't stop .. , we can 't fail now . - Why wrestlers ? There are other people . - Yes , but without the qualities we need . - We need athletes , very strong people so our specimen will be perfect as I dreamt . - Quick , tell our men I need another body . They know where to find it . I have the winner ! I have the winner ! Wait ! - What 's up , Jose ? Do you bring me good news ? - Of course Swedish ; I 'm always your man . - I had to haggle a bit , but I got you a magnificent motorboat at half price . - Great ! - Are you going fishing ? - Yes , I 'm going this afternoon . I will bring you back a fish this size . - Good luck Swedish . - Thank you for the favour , Jose . - I 'm always at your service . - What a great guy . I 'll try to catch a tuna and a big swordfish ... - Did I hurt you Esmeralda ? - No , but thanks for training with me . - We 'll train whenever you want . Goodbye ! - Thanks ! Goodbye ! That Batwoman is a nice girl . - Hello ? Mario ? Any news ? - No , our men are on patrol at the port . And you ? - I 've not noticed anything suspicious . - And the agent who has put a tap on the phone ? - Nothing . - Ok . I hope it will remain that way , although I don 't think this quiet will last . We 'll be in contact . - OK . See you later . - Anything interesting ? - Only routine calls . - We should investigate them anyway . - Of course . - Wait ! They 're making a call . - Number 3 ? It 's number 1 speaking . Tell Dr. Williams I 'll have one more this afternoon . They got him , Igor ! Look ! Yes , master ! yes . - Number 1 has arrived with the new donor . - Splendid . Everything is prepared for the operation , bring him here inmediatly . Bring him ! Hold him with the straps . - Did you have any problem ? - None , sir . - Batwoman has arrived in Acapulco . You know that police woman can bring us problems . - Don 't worry . After this operation , we 'll go to another country . Come on , Igor ! Quick ! Anesthetize him . Faster Igor ! Speed it up ! We 'll succeed . Move it left . Now to the right . Stop it Igor , make it stop . - Switch to maximum . Go to maximum ! - Yes , master . Perfect ! Perfect ! Prepare yourself , Igor . You are about to witness this century 's most awesome act . 400 millions of years ago in the sea , the evolution of the human being began , when the first vertebrate appeared ; the fish . According to this law , we 'll regress back to the dawn of creation . And we 'll create the image and likeness of our ancestors , an AMPHIBIOUS , HUMAN CREATURE ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha , Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha , Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha , - Look ! Look ! - Excellent ! , Excellent , Igor ! - We 've taken a step towards our desires . - Yes master . I always knew we 'd succeed . - What shall we do with this man ? - Throw him on the rocks . As far away as possible . - Tell our men to prepare the boat and inform the sea authorities . - We 'll set out as soon as possible . - Very good , master . This place is where the wrestler 's motorboat was discovered . - Did you find any other clues ? - That 's it . If he drowned , we would have found his body . - He could be trapped between the rocks . - I don 't think so . Our divers have searched everywhere with no results . - What do you want ? - A lemonade , please - I 'd like an orangeade . - Did you investigate the call from the gym ? - Yes . - Do you know to who the number belongs to ? - It 's from a billiard hall . - Did you investigate the doctor who recieved the call ? - His name is Eric Williams . He 's been living on a ship , " The Reptilicus " , for 6 months . - He is a retired surgeon who collects fish and has no known family . - If we are right and the suspect is a scientist , I think we should investigate . - I will talk with our international agent Tony Roca , so he can obtain all the information available on the Reptilicus and Dr. Williams and send to us . - I 'd like to salute him . Only you two know my true identity . - We have solved a lot of cases together . - What do you want ? - I 'm looking for Dr. Williams . - He doesn 't allow visitors . - Tell him I 'm here , please . - No way , you better go away . - Hello . I bring you a nice surprise . - How are you ? - Gloria , you 're more beautiful everyday . - And you always so gallant . - To me , she 's the most beautiful and sweetest woman on Earth . - Stop flirting , we have a serious problem that must be solved . - Firstly I 'd like to congratule you for your discoveries .. , here , I have what you asked for information about Reptilicus and Dr. Williams . He came from Hong Kong and Macao . - How did you get the clue ? - Because of the phone call recived by the doctor , the mysterious disappearance of the Swedish the same day ... - And the fact the doctor is a neuro-surgeon . I tried to go aboard , but they stopped me . - I 'll ask for permission to board the ship , - We can 't do that , we don 't have any evidence to link Dr. Williams with the murders . - Excuse me . Yes ? It 's me speaking , inspector . OK . See you later . - The inspector just told me the Reptilicus is preparing to sail tomorrow . - I have to act inmediatly . 'THE PINEAL GLAND' Don 't move ! Hands up ! Boss , look what we 've found ! Move ! Arrrrrgggh ! Catch her ! Catch her ! Catch her ! She has no weapons . Quickly ! Don 't let her escape . C 'mon ! There she is ! Shoot ! - Number 1 , we have to catch this woman . - But master , we don 't know her identity . - You have to fix it ! Use your brains to find out who she is . And as fast as you can . My next objective now is take revenge on this damned woman . - Congratulations Esmeralda . You 're better everyday - Thanks to your tips . - Bye ! - Bye ! Who wants the lucky number ? - Can I drive you home , Esmeralda ? - Thanks , but someone is picking me up . - As you wish . Have fun . See you tomorrow . - See you tomorrow Are you crazy ? Do you want to kill her in broad daylight ? Let 's follow her . Come on ! We 'll wait . She has to come out through this door . - It 's impossible to know which one is is her . - It doesn 't matter . We know her car . - We 'll wait till she leaves . - Still thinking the same ? - I can 't get it out my head , Mario . - I 'm sure that thing I saw in the fishtank , was a fish-man . - I know it sounds incredible , doesn 't it ? - If you were looking through the keyhole maybe your sight failed . - I 'm sure you only saw a fish . - Maybe , but I 'd like to be sure . - Are you thinking of returning ? - No , it would be very dangerous right now . - I agree . And the next time you decide to do a thing like that , tell me first , OK ? - I have to go . I have orders . I wish you luck . You 'll need it . - Your right and if we don 't see you again , please remember us . - Captain ? - Yes , Diaz ? - Can I talk with you ? - What 's up ? - Thanks . I have to leave . - Is everything ok ? - No . - Can I go with you ? - No , you better stay here . I 'll talk with you later . - Let 's go . Faster .. , and put on your masks . A car is approaching . Follow us . Don 't move ! Step back ! Drop your weapons ! Drop the weapons ! Get back ! I 'll let police headquarters know we are here . - You 're coming with us to an isolated place . - Are you gonna ' shoot me in the back ? - It would be nice , but we 've planned something worse . The police ! Let 's go ! - The same symptoms Doctor ? - Yes , captain . A hole in the cranium and gland juice extraction . - It 's clear that Dr. Williams is behind this . Don 't we have enough evidence ? - He was the only one who could 've ordered the attack that almost killed me . - Too many coincidences that you are not taking into account , Mario . - Calm down and try to understand . We don 't have enough evidence . - These coincidences you 're talking about are not enough . - All right , excuse me . - But unfortunatly , I don 't think this chain of death is going to stop . - I only wish there were no new victims . - Thanks , Dr. - How is it possible you failed ? You 're a bunch of stupids . - But master , we ... - Don 't tell me nothing ! - Don 't try to justify the stupidity of you and your men . - I don 't want to argue , I 'm concentrating on an important experiment . - Go get on your diving suits . - Now get out . - Have you found the exact place we need ? - Yes , master . I think this place is it . - The water temperature cannot be below 22 degrees centigrade . - It 's at 22 , depth is 100 metres . - Perfect . This will provide us the pressure we need . - Is the radiation unit recharged ? - At it 's maximum , master . - OK - It will be drugged until we irradiate it . - Now ! - The unit is in place . The divers are returning master . They can wait at a secure distance while we irradiate . When the fish-man has grown , they can bring it back here , OK ? Get ready Igor . Now ! Look Igor ! We 've done it ! We 've done it ! That 's enough , Igor . Get it under control . - Prepare the wet mattress . - Ok , master . - Take it to the special room . - Igor , tie our creature with the straps and don 't let anyone enter the room . - Yes , master . - I want to start the second phase of our project .. , as soon as possible . - What is the second phase , master ? - The creation of a FISH-WOMAN . - And I don 't need to tell you who that will be .. , You killed them , damn you ! Die ! Die ! - Die ! Die ! - What are you doing ? - Give it to me ! - Stupid , you nearly killed it . - It looks paceful , Mario . - I think it 's the right moment to investigate . - You never give up , do you ? - Never . Besides , Dr. Williams is the only clue we have . - Master , come here .. , Look ! - Do you want me to go with you ? - Not necessary . Call me on the radio if there 's movement on the yacht , or any danger . - Ok . Be careful . She has to be the Batwoman . She escaped us before , but not this time . - What 's your plan ? - Come with me . I will use Pisces , he will get her and I will convert her into a fish-woman ! Pisces , I want you to bring me that girl diving out there . Grab her ! She is going to be your partner . This is the destiny I have prepared for her . If you don 't do it , this will be your punishment . Enough Igor . Open the hatch . She lit a submarine flare . She 's trying to burn it ! She 's swimming away master . Pisces is afraid of fire . The flare has burned out . A monster is after me ! - What monster ? - The specimen of Dr. Williams ! There it is ! It 's going to turn over the motorboat . The Police will think it 's an accident . Damn it ! He 's lit the gasoline . They are running away , Igor . - It 's incredible . I can 't really understand what kind of creature it was . - Now do you believe I saw a similar monster in Dr. Williams laboratory ? - Of course . But the creature you saw was smaller than that one . - All right . But if Dr. Williams can create a small creature , maybe he made a bigger one too . - Anyway , it 's time to act . I 'll tell the inspector to raid the yacht . - What are you going to tell them ? That you saw a human fish-creature ? - Nobody will believe you , Mario . - That 's true . - The only thing we can do now , is go on investigating . I have it , Igor . This time we cannot fail . This transmitter will emit sound waves that Pisces can recieve , all thanks to the miscroscopic control we grafted into his brain . Nº 1 will put it on that woman 's cape . And then it will be very easy to locate her . Pisces will bring me the woman . And then , my vengeance will be terrible , TERRIBLE ! - And the policeman ? - He will share the same fate . - We will go to another country and make a dozen ; a hundred fish-men , we will control the seas and oceans . We will create HUNDREDS ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha , Winning ticket , winning ticket , Let me through please , - At last I 'm home . Do you want something to drink , Mario ? - Of course ! Nice idea . - Can you prepare it while I change ? We 'll wait till midnight to release Pisces . - What are you looking for ? - A blanket . - For what ? - I 'm staying here tonight . I don 't think you are safe alone . - Mario .. , please . - It 's decided . - OK The sound has stopped . The emitter must be wet . Probably because Pisces is in the sea with her , Now , we 'll force him to come back . Turn it on ! I must grab this woman as soon as possible . - Mario , Mario , can you hear me ? Mario , talk to me . - Where is the monster ? - He went away . - We were lucky .. , - It was all my fault . - What do you mean ? - Someone put an emitter on my cape , - I thought it would lead our enemies to us , but I never thought the monster would come . - I 'm sorry Mario . - Don 't worry , we 're safe now . - Let 's go . I don 't understand why Pisces didn 't complete his task . All he had to do was bring me this damned woman .. , And he DIDN 'T ! - The plan was perfect . - Something went wrong master . - That 's obvious .. , but I can 't understand it . - We need to catch her . This woman is a serious danger to our plans . - We must find a way to do it . - Wait ! She works for special agent Robles . - True . - If we capture him , she will look for him . - And , when she begins to look for him .. , we .. , YES .. ! it will work ! What a great plan ! Look ! There seems to have been an accident , Let 's go . - Hands up ! - What 's going on ? - Search them . - Don 't move ! - What do you want ? - Take them . - Where ? - None of your business copper ! - Move ! Put them inside . We have Captain Robles and the inspector . If you want to see them alive again - don 't call the police . Go alone to the yacht and remember , if you don 't do this right both your friends will die . - Forgive me hanging you , but I promise , when you friend arrives , your suffering will end . - Do you think she will come to help us ? - Of course . As far as I know , she has done this before . - Why not now ? - Is everything prepared , Igor ? - Yes , master . As you can see , we 've prepared for her arrival . Don 't move ! - We have Batwoman , master . They 're bringing her here now . - Magnificent ! - Do you see ? I was right ! - At last ! At last I have her . - Are you sure she was alone ? - Yes , master . - Excellent ! - Gentlemen , you 've caused me problems , but .. , I 've decided to use your lives in a glorious fate . Look at this , - The pineal juice from your bodies will be used to create two entirely new creatures . Like the one you see here . Whom I 've named Pisces . And , you - who turned me into a monster , I will create the first fish-woman . Move ! Bring her to the operating table . You idiot ! , Don 't you understand you 've been defeated ? Let 's go ! We 'll operate immediatly , Igor . It will be interesting to see if a woman can survive such an operation , We 'll see if we can catch the pineal juice before she dies . - Until now , no man has survived , but maybe a woman is more suited for this experiment . - You 're crazy ! - Maybe ; a thin line divides madness from genius . - Everything is prepared , master . - Nº 1 , tell your men to guard at the door . - Come with me . - Do we use anesthesic ? - Pentotal , then Ciclopropane . - You are the first strangers to have the honour of seeing an operation that transfers pineal juice from a human being to a fish . And now .. , it 's time . - You will go down in history , along with my name , - I 'm afraid I have to reveal your secret identity . - I really want to know the true identity of the enigmatic and marvellous woman - who got caught so easily . Igor , take off her mask . - Stop , Pisces ! Stop ! I command you ! Igor ! Igor ! We must get out of here fast , Mario . This yacht is going to explode ! C 'mon ! I don 't understand . Why did the monster attack , just at the right moment ? God was watching you . - I 'm sorry to contradict you Tony , but providence didn 't play a part . - What ? - Do you remember that little emitter ? - Of Course . - I had it with me , and when the chance arose , I put it on Dr. Williams ' white coat . So , when the fish-man attacked , I knew it would kill whoever was wearing it . - And if you were wrong ? - We 'd be dead now . Pretty simple , isn 't it ? - A mouse ! - What 's going on ? - There 's a mouse over there . Kill it , please ! - There 's a mouse ! Kill it , please ! It 's so horrible . - Women eh ? - Women ! 2007 FANSUBS by Pulasky and Dresden

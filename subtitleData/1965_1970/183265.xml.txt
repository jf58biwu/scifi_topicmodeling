 Lieutenant ! Good morning . Boy , with a good-looking nurse like that on board , I wouldn 't mind running a fever . Just remember , sailor , I 've got lots of castor oil in sickbay . And you , too . Yes , sir ... Ma 'am . Lieutenant ! Thanks . Oh , a gorilla . Are we going to make surveys of animals on this trip , too , Commander ? No , this is just for our own amusement . This has nothing to do with our report to the UN . Well , I don 't see how you can be amused by gorillas . I think they 're dull . Well , this one is 60 feet tall . What do you think of him ? Sixty feet ? That 's right . This is Kong . The strongest living creature on earth . Oh , yes , I remember . A legend . And yet , underlying that old legend is some truth . Are you saying that Kong is not just fictional ? Yes , I 'll show you . I 've devoted a good many years to research on Kong . Data I 've obtained ... shows that a giant anthropoid had lived on an island in this area . It still may be there . It may . See this picture ? Right here . These are steps from some ancient stone ruins . I thought so , too , when I first saw it . But those steps are each 10 feet high . No human can climb that high in one step . What do you think , Commander ? What I 'm trying to figure out is ... who built it ? And for what purpose ? Do the islanders really think this was done by a giant ape ? The natives of the Java Sea most definitely believe in Kong . And , Susan , look at this tunnel . This is also Kong 's work . Which island is it ? The island is Mondo . Right there . Just a little way off our course . Cdr . Nelson , take us there for a look . Sorry , we have no time to spare . We 're here to seek oil , you know . We have our orders from the United Nations Research Council . I wish there were some way , but ... He 's exactly like the original Kong . With this , the world is ours . It 's still not the original . - You sure you just didn 't build a giant toy ? - A toy ? That 's an insult . How can you say that ? It is the strongest thing there is in the world today . Need I remind you how I feel about that ? How does it help my government get Element X ? This robot can do anything I program . You can see that I had it constructed exactly as Carl Nelson planned it . This man , Nelson , is interesting . Will you get on to the point ? Most certainly . The giant Kong was Nelson 's model . This famous scientist researched the legend ... and he reconstructed the strongest creature on earth . You stole it . Mmm-hmm . I took his drawings ... and my genius translated them into a robot Kong ... that can certainly do anything the original Kong would have done . That ego is showing again . Remember , my country buys results . Doctor , we do not underwrite your precious ego . I quite understand . I shall soon let my Kong show you that he can certainly do the job . Obtain Element X , Dr. Who , and you succeed . My government insists you succeed . You understand that ? I do , Madame . We are all ready to start . You 'll observe my creation doing now what 's never been done . We 'll go outside . Forty-two thousand . Mark ! The rays of Element X are strong . You are aware the entire world has unearthed ... the total of only three ounces of this rare element . No one could mine , until now , this crater . Down there is a deposit of tons . My robot Kong is in position . After all these years of labor , success has come . He will bring out 10,000 tons of X , this robot . We are ready , Doctor . Test results ? Excellent , sir . Shortly , your country is going to gain nuclear domination of the universe . America and the Soviets can never catch up . Shouldn 't we count on this taking years , Doctor ? A hundred days , Madame . That soon ? Element X is unparalleled . You 'll create a nuclear arsenal fast . I predict you 'll rule the entire world in time . This is an historic day . It 's quite a treasure you turned up at the North Pole , huh ? Shall we get under way ? All right , you may start . Right . That robot is extraordinary . The real Kong couldn 't do what it can . What 's happened ? It 's nearly there now . You did that ? No , sir ! Get out . What 's wrong ? The magnetic mass has destroyed his circuits . We will start again . I want you to redesign this circuitry and shield it . You are to work day and night . We shall start right now . Where are you going , Madame ? Don 't you know , Doctor ? Don 't desert us now . It 's only going to take us a short while longer . Do what you want to . Our country is withdrawing all aid , Doctor . You can 't do this . I must ask that you reconsider . You force me to delay the new construction , and the source of Element X is mine . Only I can take it . What if another country gets it , not yours ? Should I take that as a threat ? Your country already has a huge stake in the robot . I don 't suggest you quit . All right , I 'll request that we grant you the extra time you want . Dr. Who , I should mention this : more of your blundering , and you 're through . Control Guard . Control ! Turn it off ! Hey , get him out . Hurry ! Come on , give me your hand . Up you go . Come on . Secure the engine . All stations , report your damage . How does it look down there ? Hey , something 's wrong with the rudder . Water pipe on the port side broken . - What happened ? - Rockslide down the canyon wall , sir . Commander , we should take a look at the rudder . All right . Surface for repairs . Control ! Aye , aye , sir . Surface , 15 degrees . We 'll have to check the nuclear reactors . Sir , we 're getting the repairs under way . Thanks . That rockslide was made to order . There 's a perfect bay for anchoring on that island . Let 's take advantage of it while the ship is being repaired . You 're hurt . Why didn 't you come for treatment right away ? - It 's nothing . - I wish you would do as you 're told . First chance I get to do my job as a nurse , and you ... Oh , my . What are you laughing at , sir ? I can 't help it . You 've got your wish , and I 'll get mine . We 'll be landing on Mondo Island . That 's funny . There are no villagers here this time . Was the island inhabited ? Do you understand ? Yes . It 's a Javanese dialect . He 's warning us not to enter . He says that it 's taboo , and that it must not be broken . Kong ? Wong . That means , " king . " The natives call him King Kong . He says we 're trespassing on Kong 's home . Do you mean he actually exists ? We 'll soon find out . Let 's get hold of the old one and see what else we can learn . - Susan , you 'd better wait here . - Alone ? You 're safer here . Watch yourself . This way . Over there . No , don 't shoot . Wait . Kong ! Look . Put me down , Kong . Put me down ! Down ! Kong , put me down ! Please , Kong . Down . Susan ! - Let 's get out of here . - Wait . We can 't leave him like this . It 's our only chance . Now come on . Hurry . We 're lost if he catches us this time . Look , starboard . He jammed the controls . Look , there 's Kong . I think we stabilized it . Hang on . Here we go . Take the controls . Stop firing ! Stop firing ! Hold it , men . This is your commander . We 're coming aboard . Give the order to dive . Prepare to dive . Rig to dive . All right , sir ? Yes . Stand by for emergency dive . We can 't , sir . The rudder 's not working yet . Well , then , we 'll just have to make ... Hey ! How are you doing ? Are you through ? Not yet , sir . - How much longer ? - Should be about 10 minutes more . That long ? All right . Hurry . I don 't think he means to sink the ship . Is he playing a game with us ? No . I don 't think he is . What do you intend to do ? He wants us to get out there , so I 'll go out and quiet him down . Commander , I 'll go out . I won 't let you . Kong let me go when he had me in the palm of his hand . Commander , let me go , please . He wants me . Is there any other way ? All right . See if you can win some time for us . We 've got to get out of this inlet . Make preparations to dive . Make emergency repairs . Aye , sir . Susan . You okay ? Take care . Kong , please ! Don 't shake the ship . I sleep and I eat on this ship . Engine rooms , A-okay . You 'd better stand watch outside . When we 're ready to dive , call Susan in . Put me down . Please ! No . No , Kong . Take me back . Take me back to the ship , Kong . Let 's go to the ship . Please . I don 't want to go with you . Thank you , Kong . Susan , we 're all ready . Goodbye , Kong . You gave us quite a scare out there . Your attention , please . We 're dropping everything and heading directly for UN headquarters in New York . Our report will create a sensation among the world 's scientists . And you 'd better get out of those wet clothes . Kong is back on shore . This is Mondo Island , the home of Kong . And in addition to Kong ... there are mammoth reptiles living on the island ... that have long since become extinct on other continents . This island could be called a living museum of the prehistoric age . This concludes my report . Are there any questions ? At the meeting of the scientific committee this morning ... it was decided to send the Explorer out again . Is this for the purpose of capturing Kong ? No , not to capture him , but to study him in his natural habitat . It would be , to say the least , difficult to care for him here in New York . Will you be accompanied by the same crew ? Yes . Essentially the same crew will go on the expedition . Especially Lt. Cdr . Nomura and Miss Watson , sitting here beside me . They are very well-known to Kong . Kong was apparently gentle with Lt. Watson . May I ask why ? Miss Watson , do you know a reason you can tell me ? It 's very easy for us to understand . You see , as ridiculous as it may sound ... Kong is a male and Miss Watson is ... Well , see for yourselves , gentlemen . If there are no further questions ... I will now turn the meeting over to the Chairman of the Council . Thank you very much for your kind attention . Code signal , LCM3 . Go ahead . My country is going to grant you more time . Nelson sold you on the Kong , huh ? We can now use his Kong to do the digging for us . The real Kong 's a mammal . Could he stand the radiation , Doctor ? Kong can resist it better than anything . He cannot stand it forever , though . We will only need the big beast a day or two , you know . I think that , that will have to do . I agree . Now I shall go after him . Can you get Kong to obey you ? You should consider that , Doctor . You should know that I do . You should also know , we can 't go on without your aid . You can do this without additional aid . You can control Kong as Nelson did . A woman is the secret . Susan Watson got Kong to do anything she asked . Might I ask , what do we do with Watson and Nelson when we 're through ? That is quite easy . Merely a dirty detail . I 'll support you 30 days more . How you do it is your concern . I want you to succeed . I should hate to hear that you had died . Must proceed quickly . The Explorer , with Nelson , will be here any day . - Your copters should be ready right now . - Yes , sir . There he is . - All right , get ready . - Ready , sir . Away . That 's good . Let 's land . Excellent . Hook up to him . Yes , yes . Kong 's mine now . Ready to go , sir . That 's good . Prepare to land . This proves Kong 's still on the island . Yeah , I think he 's still here . Had a recent rendezvous . He must be near here someplace . We don 't want to excite him , so just the three of us will go on from here . Aye , sir . Let 's go . Kong 's opponents were human beings . It smells like ether . Lieutenant ... have the men collect samples of these shell casings . Then let 's spread out and search for Kong . We should be able to find him easily enough , if he 's lying around someplace . Okay , get going . It looks like Kong escaped after putting up a terrific battle . Yes . Still , I don 't know . Carl ! Carl ! Here . He 's been shot . Is there any chance ? What did he say ? He said that an Oriental skeleton ... a devil with eyes like a gutter rat ... kidnapped Kong and took him away into the skies . - Lieutenant , see that he has a decent burial . - Yes , sir . Was he the only one here ? It looks that way . Wish we could have talked to the old one sooner . He told us enough . I have an idea who the kidnapper is . It must be my old friend ... that international Judas , Dr. Who . Send this rush to New York . Aye , aye . " Proceed immediately to Station 6318 , north . " Start investigation at the nearest field office . " Right here . That 's Tokyo . It looks like an Asiatic country is tied in . A check in Tokyo will tell us where this came from . I don 't know . Do you really think we can locate Kong ? Sure . We 'll find him . As long as they haven 't taken him to the North Pole . All right . Come down . Knock before you enter next time . All right , state what it is you want . New York , huh ? The UN has begun to ask a lot of questions about us . The members of the UN Science Council already know this name . Don 't worry about them . You sure you removed all evidence ? Yes . Worry not . I can outwit the UN any day and anytime . Did you see our giant ape ? My thought is that under ether he won 't be much use . You underrate what a genius I am . I can control the ape . Will he do as you order ? Hypnotic susceptibility . That 's the secret . Hypnosis ? A creature with Kong 's intelligence is easily handled . That 's another little thing I learned through Carl Nelson . Recall , Doctor . You agreed that you would get Carl Nelson 's crew ... so that they could handle Kong , yes ? Nelson and his crew will be on their way soon . This is their last trip . They will aid us as needed , then we will just do away with them . A Japanese aircraft is calling the Commander . I will connect you , sir . Roger . Put him through . Over . An emergency has arisen . I have been sent from the UN Field Office ... to transport you to Tokyo as fast as possible . Cdr . Nelson , Lt. Cdr . Nomura , and Lt. Watson ... are requested to immediately collect all pertinent evidence ... and transfer to this aircraft . Over and out . Right here . What is this emergency situation ? The Kong has gone ashore at Hokkaido , sir . Hokkaido ? Yes , early today . We 're under orders to take you and your crew there right away . I don 't trust the pilot . And I don 't think they 're Japanese . Release him . Is it all right ? He 'll do whatever I say . Kong , you are to obey these orders . Listen . Element X is in the crater . You will go out there and dig it up . That tunnel will take him right into our crater . Let 's hope that nothing goes wrong now . Kong , you must dig faster . Kong ! Continue . Go ahead . Remember , you 're to dig it up . My Kong could never dig like that . Kong , what 's the matter ? You 're slowing down . Wake up ! Dig ! Kong , you must do as I order . Dig . Continue to dig . Kong ! Wake up . You shall not sleep . Wake up ! Dig ! Dig , Kong . Dig . Can 't you hear ? Go on , you idiot ape . Kong . Kong , wake up . I command you . Dig , you dumb beast . Out . Get away . Let 's go again . Kong , once again . Dig ! The beast has escaped . Close the tunnel , quick . Right . Just as I thought . Kong could very easily stand the radiation . Unluckily , we couldn 't maintain the power that we had . - Now what ? - Sir , Nelson 's in the laboratory . Oh ! Carl Nelson is here now ? Aye . They constructed a robot just like ours . Looks like Dr. Who wasn 't satisfied with a robot . He wanted the real Kong . Carl , glad you could come . Nomura , you , too . Been a long time . Obviously , not enough years to suit me . What is this all about ? Is Kong here ? Yes . That 's where he is usually kept . What do you think of this Kong ? Do you recognize your brainchild ? You 'd steal Niagara Falls for a drink of water . But ... you want the real Kong to do something the robot can 't do . Right ? I 'm after X , Nelson . Element X ? Mmm-hmm . Under the ice here is all I want . Only Kong 's muscle can get it all out . You know what we can get from him . You can 't use the robot , huh ? And Kong won 't do what you want him to do . - That 's why you brought us here . - You are so right . You think we 'll agree to help you ? I predicted you would not . Will you , Lt. Watson ? I won 't help you , either . We shall see . Come . Well , this is great . It 's a pretty odd lab . So this is Dr. Who 's guest room . With no color television . At least we can joke a little . Actually , I 'm awfully afraid . We all are , Susan . If Who manages to extract the Element X ... there 'll be no object in keeping us alive . Nelson , you are to come . Hello there . Won 't you sit down ? Would you like a drink ? Yeah . Why not ? You know , I 'm slightly confused . You take your typical Oriental Mata Hari , now ... What are you saying ? Let me put it this way . If you 'll excuse the corny cliché ... what 's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this ? My answer is a corny cliché . Did you ever hear it ? Don 't judge a book according to its cover . Or a snake , by its color . That 's well-put . What 's your connection with Dr. Who ? Business . But you should know that I don 't really want to go on in it . Tell me one thing first . Do you work for him , or does he work for you ? Does life here in the North interest you ? My dear , we can easily get all the world capitals . London , Paris ... I can arrange it so this lab is yours . Please stay here with me . You can run the whole thing , Carl . If the money holds out . What if there 's no country to buy Element X ... once you mine it ? You don 't have to be worried about that . You 're not Japanese . Chinese ? Thai ? Vietnam ? Burma ? You 're getting warm , Carl . Getting too warm . All right . He 's a hard one to handle . Nelson 's an unusual man . He is not the kind of man that you are used to . That 's why he appeals to me . An idealist . But I know how to make him do anything we want . Susan . Look at it this way : it can only get better . Because it certainly can 't get any worse . Carl , look . Carl , may I see you outside ? What is it this time ? Torture ? It 's been too long since we 've had a game of chess together . Your two friends are quite affectionate . They could be happy , if you don 't interfere . Susan . Now the cell temperature is zero . You know they can 't stand the bitter cold . You know what will happen , unless you rescue them . Only a little cooperation will do it . Susan , here . This will ... No , Jiro . It 's better this way . If you 'd just cooperate ... those young people could be enjoying a little hot tea right now , Carl . Kong will listen more to those two than to me . Check . Those walls are being turned into ice . Why won 't you save them ? Why should you endure this when it is not necessary ? Nelson cannot aid you any longer . He 's been cancelled . You dog . I am a realist , and I need you . So I am going to be generous . I will let you go without a bit of trouble and with lots of cash . You just have to do one thing for me . You think I wouldn 't kill you ? I could and I would . Susan ! Susan ! Jiro ! Jiro ! Do you think you can change your ideals now ? Are you ready with an answer right now ? Susan , don 't do it . Shut up . Let 's see how your hero likes you when you 're disfigured a little bit . Let 's see what the ice will do to your lovely skin . No . Susan ! It 's Kong . It 's Kong . Kong 's escaped . Get the keys . Hurry , Susan . Kong 's escaped ! Look out ! The robot is ready . Go get that ape . - You 're still alive . - How did you get out of the chamber ? - Dr. Who left the keys on the desk ... - Talk later . We 've got to go . This way . Don 't worry , there 's no poison in this . It looks like we have all failed . Let 's forget Element X and enjoy a drink . Stand up . Can Kong stay in the water a long time ? Yes , he can swim a little . More than you can . He travels from Mondo to other islands as he pleases . Don 't you realize that you are through , Doctor ? We 're all through . We are all leaving now in pursuit . Get ready to go . You 're a failure . Not a chance of that . You 'll see when I get Kong , and this girl will do what I say . Get going . Ready . Lower . Let it down . The radio just had some interesting news . Kong swam ashore , near Tokyo . Don 't go . Don 't take that robot into Tokyo . I cannot permit it . Wait . It could be our last chance to get Kong . At sea , our robot Kong cannot get him . On ground , the machine will take the real Kong without any doubt . I 'm not concerned about which one wins . There 's too great a risk . It just can 't be . Why are you so highhanded , Madame ? If those two fight in Tokyo ... thousands would get killed , and you and I know it . Suddenly , you 're such a moralist . Tell us , how come ? Element X is a real killer . Not millions , not 10 millions ... 100 or so millions would get killed this time . It 's just that my country ... We can 't stand an international incident right now . Dear Madame , let 's talk inside . The giant Kong has swum ashore ... and he 's approaching the center of Tokyo . The Defense Agency urgently requests all citizens to take shelter immediately . Take shelter immediately . Please , we should hurry . Why are you helping us now ? My work now isn 't so important , but you are . Something happen between you and Dr. Who ? I can 't tell you . When you get to shore , lead Kong outside Tokyo . Otherwise , thousands will get killed . You 're coming with us . Sorry . I can 't do it . You can 't stay behind , you 'll be alone . You don 't know what Dr. Who will do . Don 't worry about it . The things you 're going to need are in the next cabin . We just can 't let you stay here . You should know that I represent a certain country . I 'll take full responsibility for you . Thank you . I 'm so sorry my country wasn 't right . Now hurry . Thanks . Thanks . Good luck . Hey , you ! Where are you going ? Hey , you ! Don 't use that gun . You 'll get the whole country out here . Don 't do it ! Don 't ! Here 's where he came ashore . He first appeared in the bay , here . Stop your attack immediately . If you force Kong to fight , he 'll destroy the city . - Who are you ? - I 'm ... Well , I 'm out of uniform ... but I 'm Cdr . Carl Nelson , captain of the UN submarine , Explorer . Yes . Now , we 'll do everything we can to try and calm him down . But you must hold off your troops . Hey ! Let me go . Please , don 't . He 'll get angry . Then he 'll destroy the city . Headquarters . Turn off lights . Fall back . Fall back . That 's right , sir . Hold it ! Hey ! It 's all right . Kong ! The UN ? Yeah . Take this . Here . Kong ! Kong ! Is she insane ? She 's all right . Kong is always gentle with her . Calm down , Kong . We 're your friends . Hey ! Look at that ! Oh , no . Come on , take shelter . Hurry ! Where can we go ? Look at that . No , Kong , run away . You mustn 't fight him . It 's not alive , it 's a machine . You can 't defeat him , Kong . Kong ! Run away ! Run away ! The real Kong seems quicker . My Kong won 't tire . Behind you . Get the girl . Kong ! Kong ! Kong , listen ! You will return quietly to the ship . If you don 't , I 'll drop the girl . Help me . Kong ! We will get him now . Prepare to dock the ship . You each know your job . Yes , sir . Yes , sir . Well ? My plans were really correct . We 're a success . A gun , Madame ? You 're going to die . Step back there and turn around . What did you do ? Nothing . I 'm Nomura with the UN . Yes , sir . - I need a ranger unit , order it . - Right . On the double ! Susan , wait . Wait there . Jiro . Hold on . Go on . Easy . Go get them a rope . Susan , don 't worry . We 're just about there . Kong . Susan ! Jiro ! There they are . Susan . Quick , the other control . Stop it , let her go . Hey , get out of here . Let 's go ! Go ! - Susan ! - Commander ! Thank God , you 're alive . It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's all over now . Weigh anchor right away . What 's wrong here ? Shouldn 't we wait till Kong is brought here ? Moron ! The real Kong is lost to us . Kong 's coming ! He 's here , on the docks . Kong 's on the docks ? Yes . We have to go . You said we were here ... to get Kong and the girl . No , get us out of here now . Now ! Do as I say . Kong , stop that ship . Get the ship , Kong . Sir , hello . Will he catch it ? Yeah . I think he will . On deck . Let 's go . There he is . Let 's get him . Keep firing . Let 's go . Kong ! Kong ! King Kong ! Don 't call . Yeah , let him go . But he 's going ... He 's going home . I think he 's had enough of what we call civilization .

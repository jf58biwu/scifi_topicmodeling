 What the hell ? Hey . You know which side of the border you are on ? You got a name for it ? Guess ... someone must have cut your tong off . He 's a seth , or ... Or has something To hide . As far as I can tell ... You hear me plain enough . Walter Henderson . Now I want to ask you one last question . You see this here card ? Is this you ? Or a relative of yours ? Well , I 'm going to call up this number . And see if they can tell me who you are . I ain 't got beds enough to be putting up mutes . Operator . I need a line out please . What ? What , can you ... can you tell me the exact location of your hospital down there ? Where the hell is that ? Oh , OK , alright . Yeah , OK , I 'll be there as fast as I can . Just , will you tell him that I 'm coming , OK ? OK . Steven , I think you will have to change that ... - This section right here ? - Yeah , because it 's incomplete . Ann , honey ? I just got the strangest phone call . Who from ? From some hospital in south Texas . A place called Terlingua . They say they found Travis . Oh , no . What are you going to do ? Well , I 'll go down and get him . Oh , wow . Well , what am I going to do ? I can 't leave him down there . What about Hunter ? What am I supposed to tell him ? Well , just tell him I had to go on a business trip . I mean about Travis . I guess you better tell him the truth . Ten to Vanhorn 90 ... The Alpine 11 8 south . Terlingua . You must be the brother of the mute . - Mute ? - Yeah . I couldn 't squeeze the time of day out of him . Must be in a kind of jam . I don 't know , I haven 't seen him in over 4 years . Is that right ? Well , a lot can happen to a man in 4 years . All kinds of trouble . Bits of trouble . What do you mean ? Well , down here , A man gets himself into a fix sometimes . It costs him a little to get him out . If you understand what I mean . I don 't understand you . I wish you get to the point , because I 'd like to see my brother . Alright son . But first I would like to ask you something . Did your brother ever get himself into a car wreck ? Car wreck , no ... Not that I know of . Then he must be mixing with some hard company . I 'd like to see my brother now . If you don 't mind ... He disappeared . You mean he 's not here ? After I came all this way ? He 's been gone since early this morning . We have his possessions . Never the less ... Saved them . We 'd be glad to turn him over to you . Soon , as you take care of our little reward . Travis , hey ! Don 't you recognize me ? It 's Walt ! It 's your brother , Walt . What the hell happened to you , anyway ? You look like 40 miles of rough road . Come on , let 's get in the car . Trav ? Come on ... Here Trav , here 's your stuff . Got that back at that clinic back there . Sure picked a hell of a spot to land in . I don 't blame you for running out of it . Look , Trav ... We 've got quite a bit of traveling to do here , You 're not going to clam up the whole way , are you ? I 'm going to get kinda lonely . Trav ? Would you mind telling me where you disappeared to for the last 4 years ? Have you seen Jane , or talked to her ? Ann and I are ... We sort of gave up on you . We actually ... We thought you were dead , boy . This is pretty a ... You OK ? Well ... Well , gee Trav , maybe you want to ... Clean up . Take a shower or something ? I think I 'll go back into town and get you some new cloths . You could use a new set of cloths , couldn 't you ? What size shoes do you wear ? Lets see ... I 'm probably one size bigger , huh ? So , where did you find that beard ? It 's pretty snazzy . OK , I 'll zip into town and zip right back . I won 't be gone long . You 'll be OK , won 't you , Trav ? OK , I 'll be right back . Damn it . You mind telling me where you are headed , Trav ? What 's out there ? There 's nothing out there . Don 't you trust me or something ? I 'm just trying to help you Trav , that 's all . Come on , it 's alright . Come on with me in the car . Feels good to be in new cloths , huh ? Hi , Hunter ? It 's Daddy . I thought you 'd be in bed already . Guess who I 'm visiting , here in Texas . Your father . Do you remember your father ? Not at all ? He was ? Well , guess what ? I 'm going to bring him home to visit . Travis Do you remember your little boy ? Hunter ? Well , he 's with us . He 's been living with Ann and me ever since you disappeared . We didn 't know what else to do . So , we just kept him . One day , he was just standing at the door . All he could tell us was that someone brought him there in a car . He didn 't know what had happened to you , Or Jane . So we tried everything we could think of to find you , or Jane . Tried to locate her , she vanished too . We didn 't know what else to do . Travis , I don 't know what kind of trouble you got into . I don 't know what happened . But damn it , I 'm your brother man . You can talk to me . I 'm tired of doing all the taking . Fill it with unleaded please . You know , I 'm getting a little sick with this silence routine . You can talk . I can be silent too you know . I just assumed that if we kept our mouths shut for the rest of the trip - Paris . - What ? Paris . Paris ? Paris ? Did you ever go to Paris ? No . Could we go there now ? It 's a little out of the way . Ah , I 've never even been to Europe . Ann keeps on wanting to go there . Cus , she is from France , you remember ? But we never seem to find the time , Because my company kinda keeps me busy . Lets go Trav . What 's the matter ? Where are we going ? We 're going to fly to L.A. You 're not afraid of flying , are you ? - Leaving the ground ? - Yeah . Why ? Because it 's too far to drive . It would take an extra 2 days , I can 't afford the time , Trav . Why ? It 's just easier to fly , Trav . It 's faster . Come on . It 's all OK . When I get you home , I 'll get you settled and then you can do whatever you want . But sir , we can 't stop the plane whenever someone gets terrified . Don 't get on a plane and then refuse to leave the ground . Don 't do things like that , this isn 't the wilderness . You 're living with people now . You should have acquired a private plane , do you know how many people you are detaining ? Sorry ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry ! OK ? This is getting a little ridiculous Travis . Are you going to leave me ? No , I 'm not going to leave you . It 's alright if you leave me . I don 't know honey , no ... He just panicked or something . Well , it won 't do any good to try another plane , it wasn 't the plane , he 'll just get off again . Well , we 're just going to have to drive it , that 's all . Yeah , it 'll take a good 2 days . I don 't understand why you have to have the exact same car you had before . They are all alike . All the cars we have here are Birds , Olds , Chevy 's , and whatever . - I 'm not even sure I can locate the same car ... - I know ... My brother left something in the car , we are hoping we can search the car and find it . Oh , well , I 'll just contact the lost and found department for you , if that 's OK sir . No , we have to have the very same car . Well , I can 't do that . There is no way I can trace the car for you . Well , why not ? You have the license number right on your form there . - Well , yes but ... - Well , just give us the license number and we 'll find it . But I can 't allow you on the lot sir . Why not ? We 're already on it ! I just have to ask you to come back to the office with me . - Travis ! - What ? I don 't think we 're going to get the very same car . But I can rent you a model just like the one you had before , sir . I need the same car Walt . How are we going to go in another car ? Give us the number , will you , please ? Come on ... pretty please ? Alright , that number is 66 7DJP You remember that ? 66 7DJP ? - It 's got a bump on the hood . - Yes it does ... What 's that ? What ? That , what you got in your hand ? A picture . A picture of what ? A picture of ... Paris . Paris , really ? Yes , picture of a piece of Paris . Where did you get a picture of Paris ? - Can I see it ? - Yes . This is it ? This is Paris ? Looks just like Texas to me . It is . Paris , Texas ? It 's right here on the map . There 's really a place called Paris , Texas ? It 's right here . Well , how come you got a picture of a vacant lot in Paris , Texas ? It 's mine . I know that , but how come you got it ? I purchased it in the mail ... A long time ago . You bought a picture of vacant lot in the mail ? No , I bought the land ... - Oh , you bought that lot . - Yes . Oh , let me see again . There 's nothing on it . Empty . Well , why in hell would you want to buy a vacant lot in Paris , Texas for Christ 's sake ? I forgot . Here Trav . Do you remember what mama 's very first name was ? Marry . No , I know , I mean , her ... before she found daddy . - Oh , her median name ? - Yeah . You don 't remember her median name ? No ... Sekinae . Sekinae . Spanish . Her father was . Yeah ? I don 't believe it . You finally decided to eat ! Eating and talking ! Before you know it , you will be back in the land of the living . You want me to drive ? Sure ! Think you remember how ? My body remembers . You can sleep while I drive . OK . Well , Trav ... I think maybe you are ready to ... Tell me what the hell happened to you over the last 4 years . No , not yet . Travis ! What ? Where are we , Travis ? What happened ? Why did we get off the high way . Jesus Christ ... I can 't even sleep for 5 minutes without some crisis . Why did you turn off ? I don 't know where I turned off . Didn 't have a name . That 's great . That 's just damn great . Where we are in the middle of the Mohabi desert and a place that doesn 't have a name . I could find the high way again . Trav , I need to talk to you a little about Hunter . How old is he now ? He 's eight in January . - She 's seven then . - Yeah . But see , what I want to talk about is ... Well , he 's like part of the family now . Ann and me are like his parents now . Ann 's your wife . Yeah , you remember her , don 't you ? No ... Does he think that you 're his father ? Well , Ann told him you were coming . Well , who does he think I am ? I told him you are his father . But see , You 've been gone a long time , Trav . How long have I been gone ? Do you know ? 4 years . Is 4 years a long time ? It is for a little boy . It 's half his life . Half a boy 's life . I remember now ... What ? Why I bought that land . Oh , why ? Well , mama once told me that ... That 's where she and daddy first ... Made love . Oh , in Paris , Texas ? - Yeah . - She told you that ? Yeah . So ... I thought that ... that 's where I began . I mean me , Travis Calve Henderson . They named me that . I started out there . - Paris Texas , huh ? - Yeah ... So you think maybe you were conceived there ? Yeah . You could be right , Travis . Daddy always had a joke about it . What was the joke ? He 's ... he would introduce mama As the girl he met in Paris . And then he would wait Before he said Texas , so everybody thought that ... He meant ... He would wait Before he said Texas till everybody thought , After everybody thought that he was talking about Paris , France . He always laughed real hard about it . So you live in Los Angles , huh ? Yeah , well we live in suburbs , But I 've got my business in town . What 's your business ? I make billboard signs for advertisements . Oh , yeah ? You 're the one that makes all those ... I love those . Some of them are beautiful . I 'm not the only one in the world that make 's them , Trav . Trav ? This way . Nice , huh ? Just been in here 3 months . I really like it , but I took a beating financing , I 'll tell ya . Like everybody else . Hi baby . - Everything OK here ? - Oh , sure ... We just miss you a lot . I missed you too . - Come on in . - Travis . My God . We were beginning to wonder if we would ever see you again . It 's been so long . Did you have a good trip ? Yeah , it was fine . Hunter . Hunter . This is Travis . Hi . Hi . I bet it was really hot coming across the Mohabis Desert . Yes . Too bad you had to drive . What happened ? Well , Travis just didn 't feel like flying . Oh , I don 't blame you . I can 't stand airplanes anymore . Especially since we live in this house . All we hear is planes day in and day out . I like them . You used to fly , didn 't you , Travis ? No . Oh , I thought ... I remember Jane telling me that you flew once to Dallas together . Or somewhere . Maybe I 'm mistaken . Honey . He hasn 't slept in a bed Since we started , I swear to God . I don 't think that 's even necessary . Where has he been sleeping then ? Well , he doesn 't sleep . He has to sleep somewhere . OK . But I don 't think he 's even going to use it . He 's got to get tired sometime . There is a towel for you , Travis , And some underwear and socks from Walt . Good night . Thank you . OK . Get some shut eye . OK . - Sweet dreams . - Alright . You polished them . That 's very nice of you Travis . Would you like to come in and have some breakfast ? Aren 't you hungry ? We are going to have strawberry waffles . Do you like them ? Do you want some ? Well , there is hot coffee on the stove if you want some . Look at that truck . Hi . Decided to rough it , huh ? Yeah . What did you do , spit shine these ? I can get you a job at the airport doing that . Do you want to trade these new boots for those old boots ? You can wear them . Thank you . Travis ? I have to rush off to get Hunter to school on time . We will be back this afternoon . Walt 's office number is on the dining room table . See you later . - OK . - Bye . - Ann ? - Yeah ? I was just thinking maybe I can meet Hunter after school And we could walk home together , if he wants to . That sounds like a great idea , Travis . Walk home ? I don 't want to walk home mom . Why walk , everybody drives . Come on , Hunter It won 't hurt you once to walk home in your life . No , no , I don 't want to . Travis , I insist , you are Hunter 's father . And get into the car Hunter . We are late as it is . You are mean . - Ryan , come with me . - Sure . I 'm very sorry about this , Travis . It 's not easy for him , Ann . Ann , it 's OK , he 's in here . What are you doing ? Driving . Where to ? Just driving . You 're not hiding out in there , are you ? No . Hunter . Travis is your real dad , You know that , don 't you ? Dad , when are they going to make spaceships like they ... Make cars ? Hunter , I 'm asking you a question . Can you answer it ? What ? Well , Travis went to meet you at school , And he wanted to walk you home . Nobody walks . That 's not the point . Travis is your real dad and ... He wants to talk to you . Why ? What about ? OK , come on . Lets go have dinner . Hey Trav ? Do you remember that time when Ann and me came down to visit you about 5 years ago ? No . You and Jane were down in Texas , right there on the coast . Hunter was about 3 . Don 't you remember that ? No . I remember , we went fishing . Yeah . I took some Super Eight on that trip . And I put it all together ? Thought maybe you might want to see some of it . What is it ? Movies . You know , Super Eight ? - Oh . - Walt . Maybe Travis doesn 't want ... What ? Well , maybe he 'd like to wait a while before he looks at it . Yeah , it 's up to him . Just thought you might like to see some of it . Movies ? Sure . Great . There 's some great stuff on it . Some great shots of Hunter on it . I 've already seen it . Well , you have to see it again . - Come on , help me set up the projector . - OK . That 's me driving . I know , you are going to be good . Time for bed now , Hunter . Oh , mom . Time to go to bed , it 's past ten . - Good night dad . - Good night baby . Good night dad . Do you think he still loves her ? How would I know that , Hunter ? I think he does . How can you tell ? Well , the way he looked at her . You mean when he saw her in the movie ? Yeah , but that 's not her . What do you mean ? That 's only her in a movie . A long time ago . In a galaxy far , far away . What are you looking for ? I 'm looking for a ... The father . Your father ? No , no , just a father . Any father . What does a father look like ? There are many different kinds of fathers , senior Travis . Well , I just need one . You think you are going to find him in there ? Well , I don 't know where else to look . Oh , I see , you want too look like a father . Yeah . Tell me , do you want to be a rich father ? No . - A poor one ? - No . Than which ? In between . No , no . There is no in between , eh ? You either have to be a rich father or a poor one . Rich . One thing you must remember . To be a rich father , senior Travis , you must look to the sky , Never to the ground . Little higher . No ... Stand . You must walk stiff , senior Travis . Dignity . You got it . Who is that guy , you know him ? Yeah , he 's my father 's brother . No ... they are both brothers . No , they are both fathers . No ... ah , forget it . - But both who 's fathers ? - My father . How they have two fathers ? Just lucky I guess . - Well , bye . - Bye . That 's my dad 's suite . I mean Walt . That 's OK if you call him dad . Yeah , I borrowed it from him . He said it was OK . What are those pictures ? That 's my dad . And your grandfather . What was his name ? Travis . Same as yours . Where is he now ? He died ... A couple of years after this picture . In that car . - Oh , he 's dead ? - Uh huh . But can you feel that he 's dead ? What do you mean ? You knew him when he was walking around - And talking . Right ? - Yeah . So can you feel that he is gone ? Yeah , sometimes . I know he 's dead . I never felt like you were dead . I could always feel you were walking Around and talking ... some place . I feel mom too . - You do ? - Don 't you ? Yeah . That 's me when I was in the navy . You were a general ? No ... This was when I was in the band . The high school band . This is you . I like this picture . Look at that . That is really wild . That 's weird when it , when there is water in between And then it turns into nothing . That 's a great picture . And this is my mom . Your grandmother . I didn 't know . It just seems that ... Everything has changed between us so fast . Ever since Travis came . What 's changed ? I 'm just afraid . Afraid of Travis ? No ... Then what ? Of what will happen to us if we loose Hunter . We 're not going to loose Hunter . Then why do you keep pushing them together ? It 's almost as if you wanted them to leave . - Who ? - Hunter . You know what I 'm talking about . You keep promoting this father son business between ... It 's not business . Travis is his father , and Hunter is his son . That 's a fact . You 've known that all along . Travis happens to be my brother . I know he is . Well , what 's this promotion bull shit ? You want us to go on pretending ... That we are the parents of my brother 's son ? Well , how long do you want Hunter to buy that ? I was never pretending . I love him , just like he was my own flesh and blood . So do I. Hi Ann . Hi Travis . You don 't sleep much , do you ? Travis . There is something I have to tell you . I was not going to , Because somehow it makes things easier that nobody knows . I never even told Walt , or Hunter . What is it ? After Hunter came to live with us , Jane used to call . Asking about him . She made me promise not to tell anyone that she was calling . Did she ask about me ? Yes . In the beginning . Where did she call from ? Places in Texas . What places ? Let me finish , Travis . After what happened between you and Jane ... She decided Hunter should be with us . She said she couldn 't be a mother to him anymore . She stopped being a mother to him a long time before that . Travis . I don 't want to feel I 'm ... Hiding something from you anymore . She was young ... She wanted something , But I just couldn 't figure out what it was . I just didn 't realize how much rage I had . A little more than a year ago she stopped calling . I haven 't heard from her since then . Nothing ? Not a word . But on the last call , She asked for me to open a bank account for Hunter . A bank account ? All I know about Jane now is ... She goes to this bank . On the 5th of each month ... And wires money for Hunter . Jane , still sends him money . Sometimes a hundred dollars , sometimes 50 , or 5 ... For Hunter 's future . I had the bank trace the wire . It comes from a bank in Huston . What bank ? I wrote it down if you want it . What 's the date today ? The first of November . I don 't think we should do that . You 're right . I meant the other thing . You will all be caught with your diapers down . That is a promise ! I give you this promise on my mother 's head ! For right here today , standing on the very head of my mother . Which is how a god treats her . Which everybody who wasn 't bought in a fucking store . Wanna know and understand to the very letter what death holds . They will invade you in your beds , They will snap you from your hot tubs . They will pluck you right out of your expensive sports cars . There is no where . Absolutely no where ... In this God forsaken valley . I 'm talking about from the rage of my voice right here ... Clear out to the goddamn Mojave desert . And beyond that . Clear up this mess though . For everywhere else in the valley always had a sona . None of that area will be called the safety zone . There will be no safety zone . I can guarantee this safety zone ... Will be eliminated , Eradicated . You will all be exerdited to the land of no return . It 's eradication to no where . And if you think that 's going to be fun , You 've got another thing coming . They made me a slime bucket . But believe me , I know what the hell I 'm talking about . I 'm not crazy . And don 't say I didn 't warn you . I warned you . I warned all of you . Thought you were afraid of heights . No , I 'm not afraid of heights , I 'm afraid of falling . Oh , yeah ? well then just don 't look down . To bad the things don 't look the same on the ground . What do you mean ? Things are clearer up here . Might clear things up . Yeah , I had a talk with Ann last night . Yeah , she is pretty upset . Yeah , I know . I 'm going to leave . - What ? - I 'm leaving . I didn 't tell you this in order to make you leave . I 'm not trying to get rid of you , Travis . - I know that . - Well , what good is that going to do ? - I wanna ... - That 's not going to solve anything . I 'm going to go find Jane . How you going to do that ? It 's been four years . She 's completely disappeared . I tried to find her , I tried everything , I couldn 't find her . Now , I haven 't tried yet . I can find her . What make 's you so sure ? Oh , I just know . Can we go down now ? No ! God damn it ! You tell me what happened Travis ! I 'm sick of this fucking mystery ! I 've been treating you like a spoiled kid ... Ever since I picked you up in the desert . Now you tell me what happened , with you and Jane ! Shit ! I know it 's none of my business . Uh , well , I need to take ... Money , credit cards . Alright , sure , you can have them . You know you 'll get it back . Oh , forget that . You can have them . I want to find her , Walt . Hunter ! That your car ? Yup ! Come on ! Radical . This is not bad stuff . Ann puts it in lunch everyday . Lavash , Ki , Ri . Sticky . Lavash , what ? Ri , Rrrr , Ri . Ri , Rrrr , Ri . I like it . - Dad . - Yap ? Where did you go all that time ? Mexico . How come ? I didn 't know where else to go . Where did mom go ? I don 't know . But right now , she is somewhere in Huston . That 's where the space center is . And that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . I have to go away now . Why ? Because I 'm going to find her . What about me , you just found me . Can I come with ? What about Walt and Ann ? We would never come back here ? Sure , but ... I don 't know when . I want to come with . I want to find her too . When do we go ? Right now . Then , come on , lets go . First we have to stop to get supplies for the trip . OK . We got to buy jackets , tee shirts , Tooth brushes , stuff like that . Maybe even walky talkies . Talkies of course . Just in case . Do you know what ? What ? This whole galaxy , the whole universe ... Used to be compressed into a tiny spot this big . - And you know what happened ? - What ? It went " Phchue ... . " and blew up . All the spark , flying every place , In space ... It was just gas . It was flowing around . The earth was ? Yeah , the earth was really gas . And the sun formed , and it was so hot ... That the earth just formed into one hard ball . Of ocean . Nothing but ocean . So there was sea animals and ... Under the water , a volcano went ... " Pachooo " And ... The hot lava hit the water ... And formed rock to make land . If you want to make a collect call , You dial the operator and tell her that ... I know . Good , then call Walt and Ann . Why ? Because , so they don 't worry about you , So they know where you are . But what am I going to say ? Just tell them the truth . Tell them that you are with me , and on to Texas . They are going to flip out . No ... but you can handle it . OK ? Why can 't you do it ? I can 't do it . Why ? Because it has to be you . Oh , jeez ... Why can 't he do anything ? - Hello . - Hi dad . Hunter . Where are you ? You know what time it is ? I 've been calling everywhere looking for you . Yeah , yeah . Hunter , just listen to me now . Where are you , exactly ? St. Vernidino ? Hunter , what do you mean you are in St. Vernidino ? Wait a minute honey . - How did ... - Let me talk to him . Hunter .

Do you remember her ? Not really . Only from that little movie we saw . You look happy then . Yeah . You can keep that . Night . Dad , if a guy put a baby down , Traveled at the speed of light for an hour , If he traveled at the speed of light , He would come back in an hour , He would be an hour older , But the little baby would be a very old man . Oh , yeah ? So , how long would it take him to get to Huston ? Ah , if they were to travel ... I would say about 3 seconds . Ah , over , I didn 't get that last part . It would take them 3 seconds ... To get from California to Huston . At light speed . - This is Huston ? - Yup . How are we going to find her in a big city like this ? - I know where she 'll be . - Where ? A bank . She 's going to deposit some money at a certain bank today . This is a bank ? What kind of a bank is this ? Looks like a drive in . I 've never seen a bank like that . Me neither . There are so many cars ... We 'll never find her . Oh , yeah , we will . Come on .

Legs get a little tired from standing all the time . Is this your first visit here ? Yes . Well , this whole thing must seem kinda strange to you , huh ?

We 're not allowed to have any outside relationships with the customers . Yeah , but you can really see them if you want too , can 't you . I mean you can go home with them , if you want to , all these places say that . I mean , how much extra money do you make ? How much money do you make on the side ?

I just don 't think I 'm the one you want to talk to . Please . Please don 't go , I 'm sorry . Alright . I 'm sorry . That 's OK . I know how hard it is to talk to strangers sometimes . Just relax . Relax and tell me what 's on your mind . I 'll listen . To you ... I don 't mind listening . I do it all the time . She was there , wasn 't she ? What 's that ? A vacant lot . I bought that land when we were all together , With your mom . Thought we might live there someday . Where ? Paris . Texas . Where 's that ? Across the red river . Do you like it ? Mean we live on dirt ? Why do you drink that stuff ? It stinks . Wait a minute , where are you going ? To the truck . Have another one ? This is not a place to bring a fancy woman . Would you say , if you had a fancy woman , would you bring her in a place like this ? What 's a fancy woman ? My mother . Not your mother . But my mother . Was not a fancy woman . She was ... She never wanted to be a fancy woman . She never even pretended to be a fancy woman . Then what was she ? She was just plain . Just plain , good . She was very good . But my daddy ... See , my daddy had ... He had this idea ... He had this idea that was kind of ... Kind of a sickness ... What idea ? He had this idea about her . He looked at her ... But he didn 't see her . He ... He saw this idea . And he told people that she was from Paris . A big joke . He started telling everybody all the time , Finally it wasn 't a joke anymore . He started believing it . And ... He actually believed ... She ... Oh , God . She would get so embarrassed . She 'd ... She was so .. She was so shy ... Lominos , cha , cha . Left , dad . Hunter , it 's me . I was afraid I 'd never be able to say the right words to you , In person . So , I 'm trying to do it like this . When I first saw you , this time at Walts ... I was hoping for all kinds of things . I was hoping to show you that I was your father . You showed me I was . But the biggest thing I hoped for ... Can 't come true . I know that now . You belong together with your mother . You belong together with your mother . It was me that tore you apart . And I owe it to you to bring you back together . But I can 't stay with you . I could never heal up what happened . It 's just the way it is . I can 't even hardly remember what happened ... It 's like a gap . It left me alone in a way that ... I haven 't gotten over . And right now ... I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid of walking away again . I 'm afraid of what I might find . But I 'm even more afraid of ... Not facing this fear . I love you Hunter . I love you more than my life . - Hey . - Hey . Can I tell you something ? Sure ... Anything you like . It 's kind of long . I have plenty of time . I knew these people ... What people ? These two people ... They were in love with each other ... The girl was ... Very young , about 1 7 , or 1 8 ... I guess . And the guy was ... Quite a bit older . And he was kind of raggedy and wild . And she was very beautiful , you know ? Yeah . And together they turned everything into a kind of an adventure . And she liked that . Just an ordinary trip down to the grocery store was ... Full of adventure . And they were always laughing at stupid things ... He liked to make her laugh . And ... They didn 't much care for anything else . Cus all they wanted to do was be with each other . They were always together . Sounds like they were very happy . Yes . They were , they were real happy . And he ... Hey loved her more than ... He ever felt possible . He couldn 't stand being away from her , During the day when he went to work . So he quit . Just to be home with her . And then he 'd get another job when the money ran out ... And then he 'd quit again . But pretty soon , she started to worry . - Bout what ? - Money I guess . Not having enough . Not knowing when the next check was coming in . Yeap , I know that feeling . So , he started to get kinda ... Torn inside . How do you mean ? Well , he knew he had to work to support her ... But he couldn 't stand being away from her either . I see . And the more he was away from her , the crazier he got . Except now , he got really crazy . He started imagining all kinds of things . Like what ? He started thinking she was seeing other men on the sly . He 'd come home from work and accuse her of ... Spending the day with somebody else . He 'd yell at her and break things in the trailer . The trailer ... Yes . They lived in a trailer home . Excuse me sir , but were you in this with me the other day ? I don 't mean to pry ... No . Oh ... I thought I recognized your voice for a minute . No . Wasn 't me . Uh huh ... Please go on . Anyway ... He started to drink real bad . He would stay out late to test her . What do you mean , test her ? To see if she would get jealous . Ha ... uh huh . He wanted her to get jealous . But she didn 't . She just worried about him , But that got him even madder . Why ? Because ... He thought that if she never got jealous of him she didn 't really care about him . Jealousy was a sign of her love for him . And then one night , One night she told him that she was pregnant . She was about 3 or 4 months pregnant . And he didn 't even know . And then suddenly everything would change . He stopped drinking , and got a steady job . He was convinced that she loved him now , Because she was carrying his child . And he was going to dedicate himself to making a home for her . But a funny thing started to happen . What ? He didn 't even notice it at first . She started to change . From the day the baby was born . She began to get irritated with everything around her . She got mad at everything . Even the baby seemed to be injustice to her . He kept trying to make everything alright for her , Buy her things , Take her out to dinner once a week . But nothing seemed to satisfy her . For two years , he struggled to pull them back together , Like the were when they first met . But finally he knew that it was never going to work out . So he hit the bottle again . But this time it got mean . This time when he came home late at night , She wasn 't worried about him , or jealous . She was just enraged . She accused him of holding her captive . By making her have a baby . She told him that she dreamed about escaping . That was all she dreamed about ... Escape . She saw herself at night , running naked down a highway . Running across fields . Running down river beds . Always running . And always when she was just about to get away ... He would be there . He would stop her somehow . He would just appear and stop her . And when she told him these dreams , He believed them . He knew she had to be stopped , Or she would leave him forever . So he tied a cow bell to her ankle , So he could hear at night if she tried to get out of bed . But she learned how to muffle the bell , by stuffing a sock into it . And inching her way out of the bed ... And into the night . He caught her one night when the sock fell out And he heard her trying to run to the high way . He caught her , dragged her back to the trailer , and tied her to the stove , With his belt . He just left her there . And went back to bed . And lay there listing to her scream . Then he 'd listen to his son 's scream . And he was surprised at himself because he didn 't feel anything anymore . All he wanted to do was sleep . And for the first time , he wished he were far away . Lost in a deep vast country where nobody knew him . Somewhere without language . Or streets . And he dreamed about this place without knowing it 's name . And when he woke up , He was on fire . There were blue flames among the sheets of his bed . He ran through the flames , Toward the only two people he loved . But they were gone . His arms were burning . And he threw himself outside ... And rolled on the wet ground . Then he ran . He never looked back at the fire . He just ran . He ran until the sun came up . And he couldn 't run any further . And when the sun went down ... He ran again . For five days he ran like this . Until every sign of man ... Has disappeared . Travis . If you turn the light off in there , Would you be able to see me ? I don 't know . I never tried . Can you see me ? Yeah . Do you recognize me ? Oh , Travis . I brought Hunter with me . Don 't you want to see him ? Yeah . I wanted to see him so bad that I didn 't even dare imagine him anymore . Ann kept sending me pictures of him . Until I asked her to stop . I couldn 't stand ... The pain of seeing him grow up and missing it . Why didn 't you keep him with you , Jane ? I couldn 't , Travis . I didn 't have what I knew he needed . I didn 't want to use him to fill all my emptiness . Well he needs you now , Jane . And he wants to see you . He does ? Yes . He 's waiting for you ... Where ? Downtown . In a hotel . The Meridian . Room 1520 . You 're not going , are you ? I can 't see you Jane . Don 't go yet . Don 't go yet . I ... I used to make up long speeches to you after you left . I used to talk to you all the time . Even though I was alone . I walked around for months talking to you . Now , I don 't know what to say . It was easier when I just imagined you . I even imagined you talking back to me . We 'd have long conversations . The two of us . It was almost like you were there . I would hear you . I would see you , smell you . I could hear your voice . Sometimes your voice would wake me up . It would wake me up in the middle of the night just like you were there in the room with me . Then ... It slowly faded . I couldn 't picture you anymore . I tried to talk out loud to you like I used to , But there was no one there . I couldn 't hear you . Then ... I just gave up . Everything stopped . You . Just disappeared . Now I 'm working here . I hear your voice all the time . Every man ... Has your voice . I 'll tell Hunter ... That you are coming . - Travis . - What ? I 'll be there . Good . - Meridian hotel ... - Yeah . Room ... Oh , you little ... Your hair . It 's wet ...

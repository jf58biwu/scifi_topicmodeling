 Subtitle by Renatinha Tankinha But the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise . and the elements shall melt with fervent heat . The earth ozone and the works that are therein shall be burned up . The geiger counter here in the studio reads 632 Roentgens . That 's six times more than enough to kill a man . Down through the ages the prophets have forewarned us that in one day , thousands of years of accomplishments could be wiped away by the destructive hand of power . Now , that day is come . All communication with the outside world has stopped . Just fifteen hours after the first nuclear bomb fell on Formosa , the whole world has been silenced , annihilated by nuclear bombs . 3 billion people murdered by a thousand nuclear bombs and the lethal fallout . Maybe there 's no one left to hear my voice . No living human being to record the end of the world . Now this is Ted Johnson for KBGE radio . Didn 't come , dad . Larry didn 't come . He 's lost . They 're all lost . Not a sign of life . New York , Paris , Moscow . All 's quiet now . Look , Joanna . It 's holding at 47 . Why , we may be saved , just as I planned it . I 'm not sure I want to , dad . Not without Larry . I 'm sorry , honey , but I 'm afraid he didn 't make it . But there 's always hope . Come , let 's go inside . I planned it right , Joanna . Our house off here miles from any city . The cliffs , the updrafts of air to fight back radiation , and provisions for the three of us for months . There 's only two of us now , dad . Honey . I couldn 't very well order Larry to come off here and stay with us . Even though you are engaged to him . There 's someone at the door , Dad . It 's Larry . He 's made it . Wait . Don 't open that door until you 're sure it 's Larry . It is Larry . I heard it . He 'll contaminate us . Larry ! Larry ! Don 't open that door . We can 't take a chance . Let me go . I 've got to open that door ! Wait . Don 't touch him . He 's red-hot with radioactivity . It 's not Larry . - We 've got to help him , whoever he is . - Wait . We better check the geiger counter . 740 roetegens ? And he 's still breathing . What ? He should be dead ! But he 's still breathing . Nobody can take that much and still live . Don 't touch him ! He 's my responsibility . - Who are you ? - I 'm Steve Morrow . That 's my brother . I 'll take him away now . Granger ? Grange . It 's OK . It 's OK . He 's still alive . I don 't know why , but he 's still alive . He must be dying . The counter showed 740 roetegens . - Where are the bedrooms ? - Upstairs , come with me . No ! They can 't stay here ! - Yes they can , dad . - But they 're contaminated . It 's too late for them , but not us . I 'll get you some water and clean clothes . Get out of here or I 'll kill you . Don 't shoot ! There 's a girl out here . Throw your weapon on the floor ! I warned you . This gun 's loaded . - OK , OK . - Stop it , Dad , don 't ! Move on in to the room here . Come in where I can see you . Are you alright ? Yeah , I guess so . Is it ok if we stay ? Of course you can 't stay . I have provisions for only three people . Mack , we 're staying , so forget the sob story . Help me . You can 't stay here . It isn 't the way I planned it . I have provisions for three people only . I 'm Joanna Ramsey . Please , bring your suitcase upstairs and I 'll get you some fresh water . Wait . I didn 't mean nothing . I was just looking to see if anyone was alive in the house . What 's your name ? I 'm Tim Henderson . I 'm a rancher . I live right up on the cliff . Sorry I roughed you up . Sure . Come on ! How did I knock you down ? Come on up the house . - No ! He can 't stay . Oh ... That will work . We all could stay . We 're all going to die anyway . It looks like we 're stuck with each other . So , let 's understand the rules . Well , I 'm the ranking officer . I mean person . I 'm in command . if we 're voting , I vote for me . Oh , don 't be funny . This is serious . Shut up , Jada . My second in command will be Steve . This counter is registering 47 roetegens of radioactivity now . 50 is considered dangerous . 500 fatal . But that depends on the individual . Different people have different absorption rates and capacities . We may live , we may not . There 's a lot we don 't know about it . Some of us may be dying now . So , how long can we leave this museum ? Yeah . I 've got some things working for me in LA , big things . So , how long before we can get out of here ? There is no Los Angeles . No Los Angeles ? You 're kidding . I don 't believe it . But there are no radio signals , long or short waves , from any city in the world . She 's right . The six of us in this house may be the beginning of a new era . A new civilization . Seven . My brother 's still alive . Not for long , I 'm afraid . But be that as it may , I 've spent ten years getting ready for this day . I 'll brief you as to why we 're still alive . This is my house , with its own generators and food supply . These cliffs , surrounding the house on three sides , are full of lead-bearing ore , that acts as a barrier against radioactivity . The lake here on the fourth side is heated from an underground heat source . Probably an old volcano or maybe a crack on the earth 's crust . Anyway , the warm air from the lake 's waters , creates an updraft . And it 's strong enough , I might add , to carry radioactive contamination out of the valley , as long as it doesn 't rain . If the rains come too soon , We 'll all be contaminated and die . That is , if we don 't let other forces destroy us before that time . What other forces ? Never mind that now . But make no mistake about it , you 're not welcome here . This was planned for just three people , that 's how much food we have . If we divide that among the six of us , we 'll soon have empty stomachs and rebellion . I have the keys to the storeroom . I and I alone , will say when and how much food we eat . Any argument about that and I 'll settle it with this . Oh , you 're a big man . packing that gun . Just don 't you let go of it . I don 't intend to . Where are you going with that ? - My brother . - Save the food . Your brother 's a casualty , face it . Take it to him . Dad , I 've never seen you like this before . We can 't become animals . We 're still human and we 've got to act like it . Just what I 'm afraid of . We 're all human . Granger ? How you doing ? I 'm not gonna die . I thought I was , but I 'm not ... I know I 'm not . No . - It 's a miracle . You soaked up 700 roetegens . I don 't understand it , but I 'm glad . - Here , grab something to eat . - I don 't want that . I need fresh meat . Raw meat . Well , I 'll put your order in with the chef . I don 't know , but I think it will do me good . Well , then , why don 't you wash up and get in some clean clothes , huh ? No , no water . Just ... just let me rest . I 'll be ok just the way I am . You didn 't tell me how you two happened to be , uh ... near this valley yesterday . Uh , we 're not exactly on the main highway . We were camped on the other side of the lake . That 's not too far off the highway . We were on our way to California so I thought it would be good to sleep out . - Yeah . Then our old car wouldn 't start and we were stranded . You two are ... married ? She 's an old friend of the family . Look kid , you can be a friend of my family any time you want . Jada 's a performer , a dancer . I 'm her manager . I uh ... I guess it was stuck . Now you know why she can 't work with a fan . Nice-looking guy . Your brother ? My fiancee . He was supposed to be here yesterday . Oh . You were going to marry him . I 'm sorry . Really sorry . What 's the matter ? It 's strange . Like I ... like I heard someone calling . But not really calling . Something strange . Come on , snap out of it . Let 's go to your father 's storeroom and see if we can find some candy for my brother . Steve , come with me . I want to check the radioactivity outside . Go ahead , Steve . I 'll get the candy . How are we doing , John ? It 's at 49. that 's up two since last night . There 's as if some magic force is holding those clouds out of this valley . That 's the warm air from the lake . creates an updraft . - Yes , I know . Oh , yes , I 've told you this morning . I 've known about this valley for a long time . The lake , too . Read about it in college , in geology . Ooh , you 're a geologist ? - Uh-hum . I work for an oil company about one-hundred miles south of here . Then you just didn 't stumble here yesterday by accident ? No . My brother and I headed here the minute we heard about the bombings . Um , smart thinking on your part . Did you know the real force of the atom has never been fully calculated ? Well , I think it reached its fulfillment yesterday . Yes , but only as we know it affects our present form of life . Or our life as we knew it before this nuclear inferno covered the earth . You think some other form of life could have survived ? I 'm only saying that its true force has never been fully understood . You 're confusing me now , John . Do you remember the H-Bomb test at Matsuo some years ago ? - Sure . - I captained one of the ships . Five days after the blast , I towed the animal ship out of target zero . The outside world never had a true account of that test . What are you trying to say , John ? Coyote. in the daytime . Hmm , must be a lot of game in this valley now . Contaminated game . Fighting for life just the way we are . What 's the matter , Granger ? There 's live game outside . I can tell . Yes , we heard a coyote during the day . I can feel it , and I need meat . Granger , that ... that game is contaminated . You ate that you 'd die . You would die , but not me . I can 't eat that canned junk . I 've gotta have some meat . Fresh . Do you hear ? That 's all you 're going to get for a long time . That 's what you think . That 's just what you think . Why ... three weeks . Thought we 'd all be dead by now . Even Granger got out of bed yesterday . - Steve , I know he 's your brother , but ... - But what ? Well he ... he gives me a funny feeling . Logically , he should have been dead long ago . But ... there is no such thing as logic anymore . What 's so illogical about my brother ? You know as well as I do . He hasn 't taken food or water in three weeks . Not since he 's been here . He says he doesn 't need food . And last night , he slipped out of the house and didn 't come back until dawn . Radiation must have affected his mind . He 's a mutation , Steve . Face it . He 's a freak of this new atomic world of ours . I 'm going outside . For a walk . Well , uh , don 't go too far . Stay inside of the house . Why ? Because I said so , that 's why . Aren 't you tired , Grange ? You need more sleep . I 'm not tired . I 'm not afraid of anything out there . In fact , I like it . Would you like to go with me ? Well , no I ... I have things to do . I think he 's dangerous . No , I don 't think so . He should be destroyed . Destroyed ? My brother ? Yes . For our safety . You can 't do that , John . Well , not just because he 's my brother But don 't you see ? It 's important to us that he lives . I don 't see why . Not sure yet . We have to study him . If it doesn 't rain in the next few weeks , I think we 're going to live . Somehow , I knew we wouldn 't die . My father always seemed so positive . You know , right after the bombs came , I didn 't much care if I lived or died . Don 't talk like that . It 's true , Joanna . But these past few weeks with you Now I feel I 've got a big reason to live . Me too , Steve . Joanna ? What 's wrong ? Did I misunderstand ? Didn 't you hear it ? Hear what ? Something out there . That strange feeling , sound , something . Stronger than the last time I felt it . That 's just some harmless animal in the bushes , that 's all . No , Steve , it 's more ! Let 's go back in the house , please ! These bones are still moist . Look at that ! Footprints ! They 're Granger 's . You think he ate that rabbit ? He must have . He spends most of his nights prowling around in these woods . 49 roentgens . You think a man could eat that poison meat and live ? No . No human could . It defies all the laws of man and God . There may be a new set of laws , John . Laws for post-nuclear life we know nothing about . Out with it , Steve . Say what you mean . Well , I 'm only guessing , but we know that even small amounts of radiation can produce change . Now , for some reason a man could survive complete saturation , A thousand generations of change could take place in a matter of weeks . The Matsuo test . What do you mean ? - Nothing , go on with your theory . I 'm afraid there are more Grangers out here . And even worse than him . All of us have survived more cumulative exposure than we ever thought possible . Do you ... mean we might all become like your brother ? Stalking these woods at night ? Eating raw meat ? It 's possible . Did you write theories as to what to do in this situation ? No . You know , when my brother couldn 't find the answer to something , He 'd look it up in the bible . He believed that it held the answers to everything . " ' For I am with thee to save thee and deliver thee ' , saith the Lord " " ' I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked . ' " " ' I will redeem thee out of the land of the terrible . ' " I had enough of that bible when I was a kid ! Oh , it 's easy to see it had no effect on you , Mickey . I 'm going to go look for Granger . What was that ? Maybe you better tell us what the bible says about rain . In our situation , we 'd better pray that it doesn 't rain . Not for weeks , anyway . Because if it does rain in this valley , it will be coming down through clouds saturated with nuclear death . Maybe we 'll be safe , like Noah and the ark . Right now , there 's about 40 roetegens of activity in this room . If it rains , that will move up into the hundreds of roetegens in a matter of hours . And we 'll all be dead . Or like Granger , if we 're unlucky . But ... maybe the updraft from the lake will hold the clouds back . They will , dad . We 've been lucky so far . We 're gonna live . I just feel it . I ... hope you 're right , sweetheart . And if the weather does clear , starting tomorrow , we 'll have to go on half rations . - How much is half of nothing ? - I 've stored some seeds and grain and I have books and materials on every craft necessary to sustain life . Mickey Brown , farmer and craftsman . Oh , another thing . We 're about out of fresh water . But there 's a spring-fed pool not so far from the cliffs . Hey , Joanna , say we were to take a swim in the pool at least your dad says it 's alright . Oh , it 's safe . I checked it today . And starting tomorrow , we can all take turns bathing there . Well , I 'm happy to want this . I 've taken more baths in the past two months than I have in all my born days together . Maybe that 's why you 're still alive , Tim . Grange ? - Don 't let him touch me . Don 't let the rain touch me . It 's ok , Grange . The clouds aren 't gonna come in the valley . You 're lying to me ! It 's going to rain ! Come on , come on . - Come on back to the house . - Don 't touch me ! Grange ! Grange , come on back to the house ! This place is spooky even on sunshine . It feels great , though . it 's so quiet . I 'd give anything to hear that downtown traffic again . I didn 't realize how isolated it would be from the house . You are good-looking . Clean-cut and that bit . It 's something new for me . Mickey ... oh , he 's all eyes for you . He hasn 't even given me the time of day any more . Oh ... I 'm not interested in Mickey . Well , you better not be . Otherwise , well ... That would be unfair competition . Yes , I ... I see what you mean . Mickey always comes back to momma . Hey , what 's the matter , kid ? Somebody 's watching us . I can feel it ! I didn 't hear anything . Something 's moving over there in the bushes ! Oh , it 's probably one of the fellas . Probably old Timothy . Hey Timothy ! Hurry up , let 's get out of here ! Granger 's not the only one hunting game . And ... after they 've finished off the game , We 'll be next . This place is cursed . Steve , we 've got to get rid of your brother . John ! He is the only way to find out we are up against , don 't you see that ? The animals on the ship . The Matsuo test . They forewarned us something like this . You know , you keep mentioning that . Are you gonna keep up the mystery , or are you going to tell me about it ? Tonight. back at the house , I 'll show you after the others have gone to bed . I have the evidence . What you looking at ? You said I didn 't see anything at the pool . You said it was just my imagination . That 's right . You just became upset . Steve , somebody was looking at me . Tried to talk to me . What 'd he say ? Nothing you 'd understand . Nothing I 'd understand , for that matter . Well , you won 't go alone swimming in the pool anymore . I 'll stand guard . My skin was tingling , my pulse was pounding , You 're still upset . Come on , let 's go back to the house . - Steve . Do you believe in mental telepathy ? I 'm afraid I 'm reading your thoughts , if that 's what you mean . What am I thinking ? It 's not the same way you were thinking about me a few days ago . I 'm sorry , Steve . I just feel like I 'd like to be alone right now . I 'm sorry , too , Joanna . Mickey ! Don 't scare me like that . I just wanna talk to you , that 's all . You know , I bet I haven 't said a dozen words to you since I got here . Hey , look , what 's so bad about me ? I don 't drink , I don 't smoke and once I even gave money to a drunken bum . My old man . Come on , don 't give me that hard to get stuff . - Come on . - Don 't ! You belong to Jada . I belong to me . Get it ? Me . Hey there , buddy . Oh , it 's you , Miss Jada . Care for a taste of the best whiskey in these mountains ? It is whiskey . Hey , where 'd you get it ? Made it myself , that 's where . I make it by the barrels back in my place . It is awful , Tim . The first taste is never good , Miss Jada . It 's that long second one that puts hair on your chest . Better ? Grange ! You won 't believe this , but I just saw Granger walk up the mountain trail through that fog and it didn 't phase him . Do you remember anything about the Matsuo bomb test ? Well , there were some vague rumors right after that , weren 't there ? Something that I have to show you . As I told you , my job was to tour the animal ship out of target zero . I got the first look at those animals . Newspapers said they were all destroyed . Newspapers lied . Three of those animals lived through it . They lived through an H-Bomb ? There was a law against taking photographs . But no law against sketching what we 've seen . There were a thousand animals on that ship . Uh-huh . That was a chipmunk . - Was it alive ? - Yes , it lived for three days . Our third survivor was a monkey . Its skin looked like rubber , but it felt more like metal . Armor-plated Nature 's answer to complete nuclear radiation . That 's a million years of evolution with one bomb ! You said they lived for three days ? When we got back to the inspection ship , they were dead . If we can figure out what killed them , it ... it may help us . We never knew . After we launched them down , we went down to inspect . They were normal , except for their appearance . But they refused food and water . - New species ? - Yes . They were the forerunners of whatever it is we have out there . Sometimes I ... have a feeling of doom . Well , I know this much . There are two forms of life fighting for survival in this valley and only one can win . And it 's got to be us . You know , I started this thing just to stay alive . But you 've given me a deep feeling of responsibility toward the welfare of mankind . Our kind . I think I 'll turn in now . Good night , John . Yes . I 'll tell the girls the first thing in the morning . - The girls ? - Yes . They should bear children as soon as possible . Steve ! That 's enough . Now , Mickey , we 've had enough of you . Get your thing and get out of this house . You wouldn 't do that to an animal , dad . He stays . - Are you alright , love ? Get out of my life ! Mickey ! A sea captain can perform the marriage ceremony in case of an emergency . Joanna , I want you to marry Steve . I want you to have children . There 'll be no wedding , dad , and no children . You have a responsibility to the future . - What would mother say ? - Your mother ? - And Larry , what would he say ? They 're both dead . I 'm the only one who knows . Who knows ? Knows what ? - Have you been listening to me ? - Yes , dad . I 'll ... I 'll marry Steve in a week . If he 's still alive . And if I am . What are you doing , Love ? This little gadget 's gonna open that storeroom for me . Can you imagine us having a kid ? Of course we won 't tell him his mother was a ... exotic dancer . I wonder what 's wrong with Joanna . She goes around in her own little world now . She slipped ... off her rocker . Maybe we all are . - Not me , baby . You still go for her , don 't you ? You 're just plain dirt to her , but you still want her ! All I want is a key to open that storeroom . All this time you 've been saying it was you and me . But you meant her . You liar ! - Ok , ok , so I lied a little . A little ? ! the only friend you 've ever had in this world was me . The only one who ever loved you was me . And me , me ! So listen , you cheap hood ! Right from the hood , lover ! Now beat it ! I want to finish this chee . We can 't go up there for at least two more months . And we 're running out of supplies . Only enough for about two more weeks . Don 't touch him ; he 's hot . Food ... They wouldn 't give me any . They ? There 's more of you up there ? A lot ... stronger . Much ... stronger . How many ? How many more ? A ... lot ... stronger . Food ! He won 't be needing food now , poor devil . Look at the head . The strange bone structure . Like the animals at Matsuo . And the same mutated skin the animals had . And ... and more like them up there . Stronger . Stage two this one , stage three stronger ... stage four may be invulnerable . How about stage one , who 's that ? That 's Granger . my brother 's stage one . There 's no doubt about it . They 're coming closer to the house every night . We 'll have to take turns standing guard , Steve . I 'd use Mickey , but we can 't trust him with a gun in his hand . I know his kind . Spawn then builds water . Timothy ? - huh - sometimes you 're a lifesaver . Jada , we 're like two peas in a pod . Sometimes we 're feeling lower than hell ... But , give it a whack of this stuff Give me a whack of this Come on , you big lug . Come with Jada , Timothy babe . I wanna pay you back for all that ever loving kindness . Request permission to come aboard , captain . Permission granted , sailor . When I came out , they started to whistle and shout " Take it off ! " And once I got my motor running , All you could hear was their breathing . Stop , or you 'll scare me to death . One time ... I , like ... ran off stage . But , Mickey , baby , he just kicked my little big fat ass and I went . Now , wasn 't that sweet of Mickey 's ? The one you did ... I 've got to return that favor . Now ... Here it comes . This is where I start to peel . Kiss me with that blue smile daddy , because I 'm coming for the clincher . No ! Don 't break my jar , please . That was the last drop I had . Good . Then we 'll have no more of this disgusting behavior . Right ? Sailor ? There 's one like you in every crowd ! Man , I 'll never make it ! But I ... uh ... Well , what have you got to say about it ? Personally , I hate this stuff . - Have a nice nap ? - Caught me , I must have dozed off . Say , have you seen Tim ? he 's not in the house any place . He 's probably sleeping it off in the woods somewhere . You know , I 'm really worried about that old coot . - You shouldn 't have broken his jug . - You 're right . I had no idea he was an alcoholic . Well , if he doesn 't show up by daybreak I 'll go out and find him . I 'll go with you. it was my mistake . You don 't suppose he tried to get back over those cliffs , do you ? No , he 'd better not . If he does , it will be the end of him . Goodnight . Just a little rabbit . My god ! Tim ! Tim , don 't ! don 't go under that fog ! Don 't go under that fog ! You 'll be killed for sure ! John ! Steve ! - What happened ? - Oh , I sprained my ankle . What 's this ? Back up over the cliff . He went back to his whiskey . Did you go after him ? Into that vapor ? How long were you up there ? Minute . Hour . What difference does it make ? Steve , I 've had the course . Well , come on , we 'll get you washed up . Don 't tell Joanna . I 've just got a sprained ankle , understand ? Sure , John . Come on , let 's get back to the house . He 's dead . Believe me Steve , its ... better this way . Poor Granger . Now my whole family 's gone . No , Steve . You and Joanna are the new family now . Perhaps for the whole human race . Look at those punctures ! It 's like ... like three steel claws . Steel claws . It 's like the hand of the monkey in your drawings . Matsuo . Ah ! Steve ! Oh ! Oh ! What is it , Joanna ? In there , in the bushes . Where ? What is it ? Someone was calling to me ! - It 's just your imagination . - No ! I was forty feet away from you and I didn 't hear a thing . Please , Steve , take me home , please . Joanna insists this thing tried to talk to her . How about the way it looked ? She said it looked like a ... an ape . The sketches of Matsuo , the monkey ! But this thing is man-size . It means it 's a man , not an ape . How do we fight it ? How do we kill it ? You 're the one who said we 'd come up with an answer . But how ? it eats contaminated flesh , breathes contaminated air , The things that kill a man it thrives on . What 's the point ? You 're driving at something . Just that in order to kill it , we must first understand it . Now , we know it has fears . It was close enough to Joanna to attack her , but it wouldn 't follow her into the pool . Don 't scream ! I mean it . What do you want ? I never had time for your kind of woman . You 're something new in my life . No ... No ... Well you won 't hit me when there 's just the two of us , there 'd be no point it . Get what I mean ? - No ! No ! - Mickey ! - No ! Mickey ! Let the kid alone ! Joanna , go back to the house . I have a few words for this child molester here . You don 't know when you 're through , do you ? You said the two of us . But all along you meant her ! Yeah , that 's right . Now you know . You and your dime store stuff . You 're cheap . A cheapie ! I didn 't know how cheap you are till I met her ! She hates your guts ! You 're cheap to her ! She 'd rather kill herself first ! Come on . Let 's not fight like a couple of kids . - Let 's go take a moonlight swim , huh ? - Beat it ! I don 't want any part of you ! Why , you decided to come back to Jada . Uh-huh . What 's the gun for , captain ? Where 's Jada ? Well , we had a little beef , she didn 't come back . Stayed outside to cool off , I guess . Ok , Mickey . I 've got something to settle with you . Tomorrow , maybe . I 'm beat right now . - You go next to Joanna again and I 'm going to kill you . - Kill me ? Ha ! I haven 't had a laugh all day . Why he was spared by the bombs , I 'll never know . He 'll kill you , Steve . Get him first . Now ! Here , take this . Just sneak up on Mickey , and then beat into him , huh ? John , you know me better than that . It 's the same feeling that made you go up the mountain for Tim . But there 's so much at stake . At least , carry your gun . Here . This one . Out of the storeroom . Get it now ! And be ready to use it . Say , how long before a guy can get out of here ? As far as I 'm concerned , you can leave now . You know , that reminds me of that kid song " Ten Little Indians : . They get knocked off one at a time . The same way with us . First there was seven . Now there 's ... now there 's ... Three little , two little , one little indian ... Then there was none . Try that again . Please . Try that again . Not me , captain . And I know to quit . Like right now . Three little ... two little ... one little indian ... Joanna ! Joanna ! I heard her screaming but she 's not in her room ! I have a strange feeling she 's in danger , Steve ! The thing ... The thing out there has got my baby . - I 'm going after her . - Wait . There 's a special lugger in the storeroom . with a 30 round magazine . Get it . Steve . Put your revolver under my pillow ; you won 't need it . If there 's no other way , use that lugger on Joanna . Joanna ! Now , that 's better , captain . This is two men and only one gun . I 'd like to have it . Looks like your ship 's fallen apart , don 't it ? Well , you 've been no help . You wouldn 't find Jada . You wouldn 't help Steve look for Joanna . You 're lower than scum . I 'm a coward . I only fight when I have to . and on my own conditions . One of them is that I know what I 'm fighting . Joanna ! Three little , two little , three little indians ... Hell yeah , sucker . I know you went after Old Tim , into that fog ... You 'd kill yourself for that worthless old coot . Oh , that 's why you 're acting so brave . - That 's why you 're moving in . - Moving in ? I 'm taking over . The woods , that house , your daughter ... If she gets back . I 'd make a better old man for her kids than Steve would . They 'd be tough , like me . Looks like there will be rain after all . You think that rain will kill us all ? You 'll know soon enough . Joanna ! Over here ! The water ! it 's afraid of the water ! Now it 's going to rain , captain . That 's good . How long do you think we 'll live now ? Well ... here ... Give me a sample of the rain water , and I 'll test it . It doesn 't register . That 's pure water . Well ... what 'd you know ? Just plain old rain water . That 's it ! Water ! It 's afraid of water ! Joanna and Steve may be safe ! What 's afraid , captain ? Are you cracking up on me ? - Don 't you see , you idiot ? That thing out there , that atomic fiend .

 Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on Americas greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony ewman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . This then , Your Majesty , is the great Magna Carta ... limiting the powers of the king ... and establishing the rights of man . It needs only your signature ... to make it the law of the land . You - the Earl of Huntington - you call yourself a loyal subject ? This is treason . Treason ! Ill hang you and all the barons who follow your flag . Seize the traitor . Seize him ! Do not let him escape . Surrender . The Time Tunnel . Surrender now ! Bring them before the king . Who is this man ? Obviously a servant of Huntington . Your Majesty , even traitors can serve a purpose . Spare them if they tell us what we must know . No one will say King john is without mercy . Huntington ... I will spare your life and the life of your servant here - Your Majesty , Im not this manss servant . As for this - I will not discuss these treasonable demands with you ... or your fellow barons . Not treasonable , but a respectful request from the Council of Barons . All we want is a charter guaranteeing the rights ... - of all our free men . - just a charter . A great charter - or as you call it , a Magna Carta - stripping your king of all his powers . If I dont return to the Council of Barons ... within 48 hours , they will call their armies ... - into the field . - Rebellion ? Yes , Your Majesty . Youll hang ... and Ill put the heads of all the others on public display . Take them to the dungeon . And if they dont tell you where the barons are meeting ... make them beg for death . Chain them to the walls . Go tell the captain of the guards to search the castle . More of Huntingtons men may have got in . Im sorry you became involved in my quarrel with the king ... but well die for a good cause . Just who are you ? That doesnt matter . But as for the Magna Carta , King john will sign it . - Im sure of it . - Itss a pity wellll never live to see it . Hot enough to sear the flesh ? Heat the other iron . Where is the Council of Barons meeting ? Whos going to talk first ? The servant ? Or the master ? He knows nothing . Begin with me . No ! - Ill tell you where the barons are meeting . - Dontt be a fool ! If you do know , keep quiet . Theyll kill us immediately . Perhaps your servant prefers mercy . Well ? Tell me , but if you lie - Therell be a hundred soldiers out there in less than a minute ... and well be dead in less than five . Now . Try for a transfer . If only that door holds for another second or two , well have enough power , but - The fix isnt firm . All we have is the year and the month - June , 1215 A.D. Ray - the homing post . If we could get it to Doug and Tony ... we could bring them right back into the Tunnel . But Ann , weve tried that before . Well , yes , sir , but never in this time period . And weve improved its capabilities . All right . All right , lets try it . If we can get one of these bars out ... we might be able to squeeze through . It would take more than the strength of the three of us . This is malleable iron , not hardened steel . Weve got a chance , Tony . Here . What are you doing ? These coals will soften that metal . Itll never work ! Get ready to fight . - Thats it . - Itss working . Keep going . Its out . Come on . Go on , Tony . You first . Hurry ! Well be safe in the forest . Go ahead . Ill take care of him . Go ! They caught him before he could get away . You know , Tony , if it wasnt for him ... we would have had it by now . - Who is he ? - Someone called the Earl of Huntington . The Tunnel transferred us into King johns time . King john ? Hes the one who was forced to sign the Magna Carta . Right , although Im afraid a lot of bloodss ... gonna be spilled before he signs it . Now , Huntingtons the leader of the barons ... who wantjohn to grant the charter . Doug , we wouldnt stand a chance if we tried to get back into the castle to help him . If only we could find the other barons . You know , according to history ... John met the barons at Runnymede . I wonder if thats where they could be gathered now . We could try to find them . At least we could warn them about what happened to Huntington . Come on . Reading : 114.36 over 11 . 114.36 over 11 . General , were set . All Doug and Tony have to do is touch that post ... in order for us to retrieve them . All right . Activate . It should reach its target . How soon can we get an image ? As soon as we rebuild power . Get the window bars repaired . - Get the guards mounted and make haste after them . - Aye ! - I heard something . - just a bird . Aye-A bird . A large green bird ... ready to catch a couple of worms . - Out of the frying pan . - What was that ? - Speak up , man . - Were strangers . Were just passing through . Aye . Well , you must be a couple of Frenchmen . Why , no Englishman would be buried in such clothes . Little worm . If you defeat me , youll go free - aye - but if you lose , were gonna skin you both alive . Eh ! Hah ! Youre just a greenhorn . Oh ! Right . Will you yield , or shall I squash you ? Huh ? Ah , you did well , and it took some doing to beat you . Aye , Littlejohn . I think hed make a welcome addition ... - to Robin Hoods band . - Robin Hood ? Yes , were his followers . Imm Friar Tuck . Youre already met Littlejohn . You know , I always thought that Robin Hood was a legend . Well , a living legend . Why , everyone in England tells of the deeds ... of the Earl of Huntington when he was an outlaw . Huntingtons being held prisoner in King johnss castle . Prisoner ? Why , he went to them in peace . Oh , well storm the castle and carvejohnss heart out . With a handful of men , we wouldnt stand a chance . Lets get back to our camp and put our heads together . Are you with us ? I guess we owe it to him . - Were with you . - Hmm . Not in those clothes . Well get some proper green for you both . Ill ride out to the castle and tell the guard at the gate ... of an important message from the king . Now then . The minute the gate opens ... - well all charge out of the forest . - No . No , no , no , no . The archers on the walls would cut us down ... before wed reach the courtyard . No . Weve got to steal into the castle somehow - two or three of us - then well seize King john ... and hold him as a hostage to free Robin . - Too bold a plan . - Thats exactly why it may work . - Whats that ? - Scatter ! Come on . No . No . - Hes badly hurt . - Get on without me . Lean on me . Come on . Doug . A staff , quick . ! Quick , after them . You two that way . You with me . Well done , lads . - Now for this . - No ! No , itll only cause more bleeding . Where can we go ? He needs attention badly . Kirkley Hall . He can be treated there . Its a retreat in the forest , run by the Baroness Elmont . She used to give us refuge in our outlaw days . Come on , old friend . Lean on me . Come on . Come on . What made Huntington think I would agree ... to even one clause of his precious Magna Carta ? Your Majesty . We trapped a group of Huntingtons followers . - Did you slaughter them ? - No , Your Majesty ... but every road and pass out of the forest is guarded . One of them is badly wounded . They wont escape , Your Majesty . If they do , Engelard , itll be your head . - But your Majesty , Ill do everything I - - Oh , stop mumbling . Go make Huntington talk . He says these men wont escape ... but as long as any of Huntingtons band remains alive ... our plan to crush these barons is in danger . Engelard said one of them was badly wounded . I know these former outlaws . Theyre sentimental fools . Rather than desert a wounded comrade ... theyll jeopardize their own safety to help him . Your Majesty , a purse of gold can succeed ... where Engelards soldiers have failed . Bribery is the best weapon . Use it . Shall I bleed you a little more ? - Engelard - - Speak up . When are you going to tell me where the barons are meeting ? When the Magna Carta is signed ... you will be among the first to be tried by its terms . For serving my king ? Our laws will make each man responsible for his own actions . You wont live to see that day . Tony and Doug must have gotten out somehow . Wheres the homing post ? Try to locate Tony and Doug . It may be possible to transfer the homing post to their new location . - Friar Tuck . - Baroness , sanctuary . Littlejohns been wounded . - Will you give us shelter ? - Of course . Theres nothing I wouldntt do for the followers of the Earl of Huntington . Put him there . - How did it happen ? - We had a fight with the kings men . I assumed as much . But Huntington has sworn allegiance to King john . Well , thats all changed . Hes being held a prisoner at King johnss castle . I must send a messenger to the village - to fetch someone with skill to cure it . Im sorry . No one else must know werre here . But Littlejohn might die . I must send someone - someone who can help him . I can take care of him . - Sterilize this . - St - Sterilize ? Yes . Put the blade in the fire and heat it ... until its red hot . Do you have any medicines that might relieve the fever ? I have some herbs . But I still think - - Will you show me where they are , please ? - All right . The best thing for a fever is bleeding with leeches . No . Hes lost too much blood already . Sulfur . Some sort of phosphorus . This root powder is used to relieve pain . - Tastes like snake root . - Is there anything there you can use ? Well , this is an alkaloid tranquilizer - Reserpine . Will you mix this with water , please ? You know , some of these so-called remedies ... if mixed in the right proportions ... could be highly explosive . I want you to drink this . Itll help your pain . Thats enough . Will you just get this bastard arrow out of me , man ? Im sick enough as it is , without drinking that poison . - Ready ? - Aye . The knife . Tell me . What is the trouble between Huntington and the king ? It has to do with the Great Charter . If King john knew better , hed sign it without a fight . Hes going to have to anyway . Huntington gave the king an ultimatum . Either he signs a charter guaranteeing that he rules ... according to laws fair to everyone ... or hes faced with rebellion . Where did you learn the art of curing , Douglas ? Just battlefield first aid , Tuck . I think Littlejohn will be all right now . - What of Robin Hood ? - Weve got to find a way to rescue him . Inform the barons of what has happened . Ill send my messenger to them . Where are they meeting ? - Oh , the Council is - - No , Tuck . What you said before still goes . If the barons decide to march on the castle , Robin Hoods as good as dead . I should have a voice in this matter too . If I am placing Kirkley Hall in jeopardy ... the least you can do is consider my opinion . - We are extremely grateful . - Save your thank-yous . If you wish to risk your lives entering the castle , all right . But suppose you fail . Let me send my messenger to the barons . Where did you say theyre meeting ? Well , theres risk either way . More risk to Robin Hood if they decide to march against King john . Yeah . The only thing thats keeping Robin alive ... is thatjohn doesnt know the council is meeting at Runnymede . There will be no messages to the barons . As you wish . The answer is to use stealth . There is a way to enter the castle ... with no risk whatsoever . I myself shall see you safely in . We three will go . You will remain with Littlejohn . - Weve got them . - Theyrre together . A perfect fix . Ann , lock the coordinates ... and switch the image to the homing post . Good . Prepare to transfer the post . The coordinates are aligned . The post hasnt moved . Try more power . - We lost the image . - Worse yet , weve lost the fix on Doug and Tony . Ah , my dear Baroness . The guards informed me you asked for shelter . - Welcome , in the name of the king . - Thank you . Who are these men ? These humble monks are going with me to London on official business . Will you provide quarters for them ? And while Im here ... Id like to report on conditions at Kirkley Hall . Certainly . Report to the chamberlain in the tower . Hell see that yourre made comfortable . - Have you any news ? - Yes . Littlejohn and another outlaw are at Kirkley Hall . Ah ! Send some men to Kirkley Hall . Youll find two of the outlaws there . Bring them back to the palace . The king will be grateful . Hes already shown his gratitude . Would the king like to know where the Council of Barons ... - is meeting ? - You know ? Good news , Your Majesty . The baroness earned the gold you sent her . Guards are on their way to seize Littlejohn ... - and another outlaw at Kirkley Hall . - Well done . And she also knows where the Council of Barons is meeting . At Runnymede , Your Majesty . Runnymede . Good . Ill get them all . But first - Huntington . Come with me . Dubois , theres something I didntt tell you . Those men who came here with me - I led them into a trap . - What are you saying ? - Theyre Robin Hoodss men . If one of Huntingtons men escapes ... youll answer to the king . Guards ! Blessings on you , my son . The king has sent us to give the last rites to the Earl of Huntington . Kindly open the door . Ive seen other determined men . They all talk eventually . Why not save yourself a lot of agony ? No need to lock it . Well be but a moment . First things first . Who are you , and what do you want ? The king sent us to offer last rites to the prisoner . Last rites ? A good idea . That may break Huntingtons spirit . One sound and you die . - Friar Tuck . - Aye , Robin ? Well soon be back in the forest . - Call the guard in . - Guard . Come in . I need your help . Quiet , if you want to live . Dont kill me . I was only doing my duty to my king . Ray , somehow weve got to let him know about the homing post . If I activate it , he may spot it . Quick , quick , quick . Theres someone coming down the corridor . Engelard ! Behind you - Theyre escaping . Open this door ! You dare to lock a door on your king . Ill see you hanging from the gallows . Let them escape . Ill butcher every one of them at Runnymede . This way . ! The rope - Over the parapet . Okay . Littlejohn . Littlejohn . - What is it ? - Get up quick . Horses . Kings men . Aye , and on their way in . - Weve got to get out of here . - No , theress no chance . The only exit leads right to them . Were done . Were not done yet . Now , what are you doing ? Theres no time . Get that window open . What ? Hurry ! The window . Now listen . When that pan starts smoking , you take a deep breath . Are you out of your mind ? Get your knife out and be ready to defend yourself , man . - What is it ? - Its phosphine oxide . Now listen . You go over to that window , you take a deep breath and hold it . And dont try to resist the soldiers . Magic ! Get another breath of air . As soon as the room clears , well come back and tie them up . Come on . They escaped , Your Majesty . They went over the parapet , into the forest . - Send soldiers after them . - Shes to blame . - Throw her in the dungeon . - No ! No ! No ! Dubois , send couriers to my garrisons . Theyre to attack Runnymede . We havent time to assemble more of my men . Well move to Kirkley Hall and get Douglas and Littlejohn . This way . Now . He was the kings courier . King john has found out where the Council of Barons is meeting . The others must have been couriers too . We must get to Kirkley Hall . We saw those soldiers tied up in the courtyard . Oh , Douglas , here is a magician . He knocked em unconscious without striking a blow . Just a little homemade nerve gas . The king is sending an army to ambush the barons at Runnymede . - Then theyve got to be warned . - Theress no time for that . Weve got to capture the king and hold him hostage to keep the peace . Thats a tall order - penetrating a castle and kidnapping a king . This isnt your fight . If you dontt join us , wellll understand . Doug . The Time Tunnel sent a homing post into the dungeon . I saw it . Tony , that could be our ticket right back home . Weve gotta find a way to get back into that dungeon . We join them . And the first chance we get , we head for the dungeon . Some of us will scale the walls ... while the others attack the archers on the battlements . Were gonna be sitting ducks , climbing up those walls . Wait a minute . What we need is a smoke attack . - Smoke attack ? - Right . An old navy trick . Here and here and here . Couriers have reached these three garrisons , Your Majesty . Theyre awaiting your orders to march . First Runnymede , then well catch and hang Huntington . Your Majesty , there arent enough guards to defend the castle . Engelard , we are not defending . We are attacking . Go saddle the horses . When the history of my reign is written ... this will be considered my greatest achievement - How I crushed those who tried ... to force me to grant the Magna Carta ... and how , for all time , I made the power of the king absolute . Yes , Your Majesty . - Are you almost ready ? - Yes . There it is . All right . Give us a moment to get to the side of the castle ... and then begin the attack . Good luck , Robin . Aim well , lads . Begin ... firing . Your Majesty . ! Your Majesty . ! Were surrounded by archers . Fire . Weve got to get to the king . Nows our chance to get to that homing post . Show me where it is . Here it is . Thats it . We should be traveling within a few seconds . Maybe its lost its power . Or maybe the Time Tunnel hasnt got a fix on us . Release me . Im the king . Yes , Your Majesty , Ill obey your every command - after we get to Runnymede . His Majesty King john ... granting by deed in Runnymede Meadow these rights ... is now respectfully desired ... to impress his seal ... upon this Magna Carta . I , King john ... do hereby impress my seal ... on this ... Magna Carta . But remember - It is the king who grants you these rights . Whats the matter ? My ankle - I think its broken . Maybe you just pulled a tendon . - You think you could walk on it ? - I dont know . You wait here . Ill take a look . Japanese . We must be somewhere in the South Pacific - World War II . Theres no doubt about it . Look . Down ! Were right in line with their target . Letss move . - You go on . Ill catch up . - Nothing doing . Just lean on me . Ill help you . I cant make it . Go on , get out of here . - Theyre laying them in right on top of us . - Are you kidding ? Come on ! You stay here . Ill check it out . Watch it . It may be booby-trapped .

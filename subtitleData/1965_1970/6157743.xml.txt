 Hello ? Yes , one moment . Max ! It 's from the hospital . It 's Robert . Aren 't you finished yet ? Hello Robert . Well , I was just shaving . Is it urgent ? No , I don 't know anyone by that name . Is that really neccessary ? Very well then . In that case I 'll be there in a minute . Bye . What did he want ? That 's really strange ... A new patient at Robert 's ward claims to know me . He refuses to speak to any other doctor than me . His name is Steinmatz ... or Metz , or something like that . I don 't know anyone by that name . - Maybe it 's one of your former patients ? - It could be , I guess . - You 'll go to the hospital now ? - Robert asked me to come at once . - What about our lunch then ? - I 'm back before 13.00 . You promise ? I 'll do my best . I should raise the rent seeing how people sleep over as suits them ! I was just here to give my fiancée a message . That 's not illegal , I suppose ? Next time I catch you sleeping over , I 'm afraid I 'll have to raise your fiancée 's rent ! I trust my nose ! When it smells cigar smoke , it smells cigarsmoke ! I demand to know who has been smoking ? Tell me now ! You said he knows me ? What was his name again ? - Steinmetz ... - Steinmetz ? - He never actually met you , but he heard about you . - Heard about me ? I don 't get him . He 's a mystery to me . - Psychotic ? - Hard to tell ... . He seems to be very intelligent . Apart from that I have no clue about him yet . You said the police brought him here ? Yes , they caught him running around asking people if they could see a white mouse in his hands . but he was acting like he didn 't believe it excisted himself . People having hallucinations is common , but not believing in what they see , that sounds interesting ! Indeed . But now you can have a look at him yourself . The man is sitting there smoking cigars ! Who gave him permission to do that ? What are you saying ? How the hell did he get them ? - Maybe the nurse made a mistake ? - Impossible ! Smoking is forbidden here . He must have sneaked them in . But how ? Well , you better go talk to him . Good morning . I 'm doctor Holst . Very well . At last . Good morning . You want a cigar ? No thank you . You didn 't know smoking is not allowed here ? No , nobody told me . Does it really matter ? I 'm afraid it does . How did you get the cigars ? Mr. Steinmetz , I 'll know sooner or later how you got them , so you might as well tell me the truth right now . Tobacco and alcohol are under no circumstances allowed ! As long as I 'm locked up , I 'll tell you nothing . If only I tried to tell you the truth , you would really start to think I was insane . Insane is such a harsh word , Steinmetz , why would I think you were insane if you just told me the truth ? The truth ? It 's beyond your comprehension . You would not believe me . I understood from my colleague , Robert Klausen , that you already know me ? I 've followed you . Followed your work . - Why ? - I will say nothing further at this moment . - You 're not very cooperative . - Let me out of here , and I 'll tell you everthing . That 's the wrong order of how things work around here . First you tell me everything , then I 'll help you . Well , Dr. Holst . I 'm not the one who needs help . It is you ! Ahh yes , I see . And I suppose you 're the one who 's going to help me ? Why do you keep me here ? This room , the bed , the window , the bars ? If you release me I promise you I 'll explain the cigars and the cognac . Mr. Steinmetz , you 're not well . I 'll show you a world you could never even have dreamed of . You 'll be face to face with a whole new science that only I can open up for you . Well . You think I 'm crazy , but put me through any mental examination you can come up with , ... - and you 'll realize that I 'm what you 'd call perfectly mentally normal . It 's not uncommon around here that the patiens consider themselves to be perfectly well . Well . Then tell me , what 's my diagnose ? You 'll stay here for further observation , and I 'm still waiting for an answer how you got these things . I already told you that I 'll say no more ! Besides , I do not intend to stay . You do realize that you have been involuntarily committed ? You can not keep me locked in ! Let me decide what the hospital can do , or not can do . Go ahead , take them with you . The cognac is outstanding , and so are the cigars . But I warn you ! A man of my stature can not be kept behind bars . Try to understand it ! Dr. Holst . You are a recognized brain surgeon and psychiatrist . Yet your knowledge is immensely limited compared to mine . If you discharge me , I will reveal new depths in life , that will make your entire world of ideas come to an end . Do you remember from history how the workers destroyed the machines in fear of the industrial revolution ? We both know how revolutinary scientific discoveries are being restrained ... - due to fear of humanity getting into a panic ! But do you realize that in hundred years , the humans of our time will be regarded with the same distance ... - as we today regard , let 's say , the Neanderthals ? Dr. Holst , will you coorperate or will you act like the workers who destroyed the machines ? Do you want to know the truth ? Do you want to belong in the future ? Steinmetz is gone ! - You couldn 't prevent him from doing that ? - I don 't understand ... . Where does this key come from ? I don 't understand . My keys are here ! I found this when I saw Steinmetz was gone . You 're name is written on it . Why didn 't you give me this before ? - Sorry ... - If you want to make yourself useful , you can get me coffee . " To Dr. Max Holst . Meet me friday at 19.00 at the canal bridge . Come alone . Steinmetz " . Dr. Holst . I knew you 'd show up . Come . Do you still think I 'm insane ? Dr. Max Holst . Born September 1st . 1925 , in the sign of the Virgo . - The sign of the gifted and the sensitive , ... - Student 1944 , took part of the Resistance . Orphan . Cand . Med . 1952 , Studied in America 1956-58 , ... - Divorced . No children . Engaged to Susanne Plesner , actress . Is that all I came to hear ? - Isn 't your specialty the central nervous system ? - Mmmm ... You 're studying certain pathological precedents to complete a doctoral dissertation ? Yes , that 's right . Then you should absolutely be perfectly able to understand what I 'm about to tell you . Please ! Please have a seat . Please . - Admit I 'm a riddle to you . - I 'm here to get an explanation . Yes , of course ! Please pay attention to what is about to happen . Keep quiet ! Don 't move . Look at the table . Look at the table ! Cigar ? - Light ? - No thanks ! Cheer up , Dr. Holst . A better cigar is not to be found . They were my only comfort in your miserable hospital . I must admit I 'm impressed . How did you put me in trance ? Trance ? You dissapoint me , Dr. Holst . Is that all you have to say ? Well , you 'll get an explanation on two conditions . And they are ? First : You give me your word as a doctor that you 'll tell no one , what you 'll experience here . Secondly , that you will perform a brain surgery on me ! A brain surgery ? That shouldn 't be neccessary . You 'll do what I tell you to ! I can make you rich . I can make you a millionaire , ... - well , even billionaire , if that 's what you desire . You 're an extraordinary hypnotist , Steinmetz . You have great powers . Dangerous powers ! But you 're mad . Follow me . Come . I promised you an explanation on two conditions . 1 : Your absolute discretion ! 2 : That you 'll perform a brain surgery on me . Here . You won 't find a more modern operating room anywhere , let alone one so specialized in brainsurgery . How did you get access to all this ? The same way as I got the cigars , and the key I used to get out of the hospital . Do you accept my conditions ? Yes . You see , Dr. Holst ... . The recent years I 've been working with various mental states , ... - such as suggestion , hypnosis and other subconscious phenomena . By time I 've come to realize , ... - that the human brain is center for several powers we absolutely know nothing about . We have now lived through a great part of the century of technology . We are now entering the century of the soul ! You see , some people have a bad memory or a weak level of imagination , ... - some have a good or even strong power of imagination ... - Mine is tremendous ! When I concentrate hard on an object , it affects my eyes and my brain center . That means a certain power has been transferred to me from the thing I concentrate on . Meanwhile , through my work , I 've reached a point where I can reverse the proces . I can radiate the object from me ! I see actively . I think things ! - You see that mouse ? - Yes , what about it ? I can easily create any material thing . But I 've spend several days of mindwork on that mouse . I need you to help me create organic life ! To help me use my creative powers to the utmost ! How will I do that ? I want you to make a brain surgery on me near basis cranii . I know it could be fatal , but I 'm willing to run the risk . Because even though I 've already made extraordinary achievements with my brain , ... - I 've come to realize that an operation is absolutely neccessary to reach my ultimate goal : To create a human being , and maintain it ! The mouse you were showing the day you came to the hospital , was it also your creation ? Yes . It was the first organic life I was able to create and maintain . It had been working my mind for days . Then I finally succeeded , and ... well , you already know the rest of the story . How many like this one have you managed to create ? This is the third . But I can not maintain them . After a short while they dissolve . They dissolve ? My concentraion can only keep the organic life for few hours . That mouse will dissappear soon enough . But after the operation ... I 'm sorry , but I can not under any circumstances help you on this basis . Your oath , Doctor ! I break it . Your inquiry is insane ! I don 't feel bound by a promise to a madman ! Good bye , Mr. Steinmetz . You remember the man in the operating room that night ? Even if my brain will explode , you 'll get to meet him again ! Blood pressure : 130 Pulse : 110 . Blood pressure : 100 Pulse : 130 . Blood pressure : 90 Pulse : 140 . - What happened ? - You got sick ? - Why did you leave ? Leave ? What are you getting at ? - Why are you all looking at me like that ? - Dr. Klausen ? Come here for a second . This was on the floor , why was it there ? Who does it belong to ? But .. It 's yours ... - I 'm sorry . - No worries ... Well well , already back again ? Susanne ? Is it you again , Max ? - Ehh , how are you ? - How I am ? Why do you ask me that so sudden ? Did you get the cigarettes ? - The cigarettes ? - Yes , didn 't you go to buy cigarettes ? - What 's wrong with you ? - Whats wrong ? Whats the matter ? Nothing ... - I just don 't understand why you come back and talk to me like we 've been apart for hundred years . Susanne ! Come here ! Hurry ! Max ! I don 't understand any of this ! Dr. Holst is waiting for you . - Goodday Dr. Holst . - Goodday Mr. Steinmetz . Please have a seat . Are you making any progres with your scientific work ? Well ... It 's not always easy to find the peace for working in that hospital apartment . You know , a dissertation about performing operations in basis cranii ... - is not something you easily get done just like that . Right , a peaceful environment . I 'll get it for you . Please tell me how things are progressing with your operations ? Would you like a cigar ? Thank you . Very well , very well . It happens every once in a while that I 'm overcomed by fatigue , ... - but that 's only human , I guess . Yes , of course . If only science could get rid of tiredness and sleep but peaceful surroundings for work , and an apartment . I 'll get it for you . Thank you ! It would not only please me , but also my fiance who currently rents a room . In fact we 've been looking for an apartment for quite some time now . ... So , if memory is depending on how these streams run between certain cells in certain ways ... - that leads to what we call pulse patterns ... - the idea of surgical operations in those temporal parts , ... - whereabout the central memorial system is located ... - are , in my opinion , not only theoretically but also practically a possibility ! A possibility that must not remain unchallenged ... - if the brain 's psychological resources henceforward are to be taken into use ... - to a certain extent that will do justice to this vessel of the soul . Proof ? Nonsense ! It 's impossible to prove such things . If only that was possible , then ... . So , you don 't believe my story ? If you were around as many ' eccentric ' people as I am on daily basis at the hospital , ... - you would also be suspicious of that kind of stories . But there are so many things that cannot be explained . Yes , you 're absolutely correct . There are still many things that medical science doesn 't understand , ... - or choose not to understand ! - My name is Steinmetz . - Susanne Plesner . I 'd like to pay . Doctor , do you describe all your patients as eccentrics , ... - or did you have anyone particular in mind ? - Why did you follow me here ? Well , I 've just attended a lecture , and thought I could use a drink . A rather exciting lecture , by the way . You should have been there , Doctor . - Come , Susanne . Let 's go . - May I buy you a drink ? - No thanks . Come ! - Max ... Bye bye , Mr. Steinmetz . This man Steinmetz ... What 's he all about ? Nothing . There 's no point explaining it . But he seemed to be nice . You 've been acting strange lately . - Is it me ? - No . - We 'll soon get married ? - Yes , as soon as possible . Who slept in my bed ? - You did yourself ? - Nonsense ! - Max , what are we doing here ? - It 's a surprise ! - Don 't be like that . - Wait and see . So , what do you say ? It was Steinmetz who arranged it . He owns a lot of flats . I told him about the tiny hospital partment , and your rented room . And here we are ! - But , you don 't like Steinmetz ? - Steinmetz and I are very close friends . How about having it redecorated before the wedding ? Ohh , Max ! I can do the furnishing , allright ? Bedroom will be here . This will be the office . For all your books and things . We just need simple furniture . Nothing to show off . And all white walls . Just one or two paintings , right ? Wow , what a kitchen ! Ohh Max , I 'm so happy ! Max ? May I compliment on your lecture at the Medical Association the other day . Unfortunately it 's a rare sight to have lectures of such high standard . Tell me , how long have you been working with the possibility of operations in basis cranii ? How long ? I don 't understand . I mean , there must have been extensive preparetions leading up to your lecture ? Lecture ? I see you 're tired . I will bother you no more . Congratulations on your work progress . Give me an explanation . Did you give a lecture at the Medical Association ? Please , let 's talk about something else . He was right though . You look exhausted . Have you been working too hard lately ? I hardly recognize you from one day to the next . Robert , I have to talk to you about something . Why did you leave me this morning ? - Leave ? - You know perfectly what I 'm talking about . - You were gone all of a sudden . - Gone ? Max , the apartment ! And you left with the key so anyone could walk in . - What apartment are you talking about ? - What apartment ? Why do you always have to make a fool out of me . - But ... what 's that about an apartment ? - Maybe it 's the apartment you told me you found ? Your plan is to let one of the new doctors take over your hospital apartment . Max , is something wrong ? Why don 't you take some time off . I 'll tell the consultant . Robert is right . You really need some vacation . Come on , Max ! - Hello . - Hello .. Isn 't it wonderful to be engaged with such an intelligent man like Doctor Holst ? We surely need more of such skilled brain surgeons . Thank you so much for the wonderful apartment . It was very welcome at the right time . Come , let 's go . Mr. Steinmetz is the type of person you can 't get rid of , when he has first got hold of you . Well ! So now I 'm a special type ? Doctor Holst , don 't you think it 's about time we had a little chat ? - Let 's go , Susanne . - But Max , if Mr. Steinmetz just want to talk to you , ... - after all he has done for us . Your fiancée is so charming . I understand that you 're feeling a bit awkward . Don 't you think it would be best if we talked ? It could be in your interest too . I hope you don 't think it 's me stopping him . Max , go with him . We talk later . Can I have some money ? I understand you have provided your twisted imaginary freak with an apartment ? That 's right , and it seems like your fiancée likes it . If you were able to see things clearly , ... - you 'd know , that Susanne spends her best times together with ... ... - ... your better self . Why don 't you quit fighting me , Doctor ? Perform the brain surgery before I ruin the rest of your life . If you don 't stop bothering me , I 'll have you hospitalized again . Remember that you escaped from the hospital . My doctor is not merely an exact copy of you . He is more intelligent , more balanced , ... - and much more dilligent when it comes to studies about operations in basis cranii . And most of all ... - a more happier man than you ! You must be desperate , Mr. Steinmetz . Why does that operation have to be performed right now ? You already told me it 's going fine with your imitations of life . My life . One moment ! Wouldn 't it be a good idea if you called your fiancée ... - to check if you 're not there already . Hello ? One second . Max ? Hello ? Max Holst here . Go there . Doctor Max Holst has already left by the time you get there . Don 't forget your wallet . - Don 't you think you 'll miss the beard ? - I can always let it grow back . In few days you 'll be Miss Max Holst . I have to go now . Pardon me , but you look so much handsomer without the beard . There are so many youngsters today , who look like monkeys . You forgot something ? ... . I called the hospital . Dr. Max Holst wasn 't present today . What a cold morning . - Are you going fishing today , Sir ? - No . - You went fishing yesterday , Sir ? - No ! You 're not an angler at all , Sir ? We don 't get many bathers at this time of the year . Max Holst ! Well , I 'll be damned . I 'm here to collect my paycheck . Max Holst . I took some days off , but now I 'm here . But ... you collected your salary yesterday ! Are you Doctor Holst ? Can you show some ID ? - No , I only have my chequebook . - Sorry , that 's not enough . I will get my ID . Hello , Robert . Can I talk to you for a moment ? Don 't you recognize me ? Well , I see the resemblance . - What do you want ? - What I want ? Robert , come on ! You claim to be Max Holst . Very well . But I can tell you that Max Holst is getting married at this very moment in Hørsholm . So isn 't it strange that you 're here too ? He tried to collect Doctor Holst 's salary ! - I called the police , they should be here any moment . - Very well . Oh my ! Isn 't that Dr. Holst 's car he 's stealing ? Max Holst , do you take take this woman , Susanne Plesner , as your wedded wife ? I do . Susanne Plesner , do you take this man , Max Holst , as your husband ? Hello . Please , sit down . Well , according to the report , you claim your name is Max Holst , ... - and that you 're a doctor at the State Hospital . Why did you give wrong information during interrogation ? Everything I said during the first interrogation is the truth . I am Doctor Holst . This is all a big misunderstanding . Misunderstanding ? Well , that 's one way to put it . I 've already talked to Doctor Holst , and there 's no question about his identity . - Where do you live ? - At the hospital . - Well , someone cleared out my room . - Can you be more specifik ? - I moved out few days ago . - Aha . Where to ? - I don 't know . - Aha . - Have you issued this ? - Yes . Doctor Holst was smart enough to block his account several days ago . Why don 't you stop this game and tell me your real name ? - Are you married ? - No . - Engaged ? - Yes . - What 's the name of your fiancée ? - Susanne Plesner . But that 's Doctor Holst 's wife ! What do you think you 'll make of this pointless imposture ? Listen , if you tell me your name , you 'll be out of here before trial . You could leave now ! I 'm afraid I can 't help you . Don 't you understand it 's crucial for us to determine your identity before we release you ? If not , how can we be sure you 'll show up in court ? What happens if my identity can not be determined ? Easy now . We 'll get to know your identity sooner or later . - What can I do for you ? - I have to talk to Mr. Steinmetz . It 's very important I get to talk to him . - Are you sure it can not wait until tomorrow ? - Absolutely sure . - Don 't you remember me ? - To be honest , no . Not at all . - By what name may I present you ? - Doctor Max Holst . - Doctor ? ! ? ... - I said Doctor Holst ! Hurry up , it 's important ! Well , well . Look who 's honouring me again with his visit . You look rather worn out , don 't you ? Steinmetz , I 'm here to inform you , that I 'm willing to comply with your request . I will perform the operation ... He will perform the operation ! What do you mean ? I don 't need you anymore ! You 're nothing compared to him . But you must help me ! Did you help me , when I needed you ? Didn 't I warn you ? Didn 't I give you enough chances ? You realize now that you have fought against me in vain ? You need help . I have a splendid doctor who will listen to you out of interest . This man appears to be sick . Could you talk to him for a second ? Who are you ? Who I am and who you are , you wouldn 't even understand . If you seek my assistence you better give an explanation . I am Max Holst ! Well , the police told me you keep on sticking with that absurd claim . That naturally means you contest my identity ? Yes ! So tell me , who do you think I am ? - You ... you don 't exist ! - Say what ? I 'm telling the truth ! You 're a mind concentration of a hallucination . - Are you really serious ? - Yes , it 's a fact ! I 'd like to continue this discussion some other time . Would you mind letting yourself hospitalize at the neurology ward ? On voluntarily terms , of course . Don 't be afraid . You 'd feel a lot better ! Heart failure ! " The State Hospital " Good evening . Can I have Doctor Max Holst 's private phone number ? It 's very important . - " One moment . 1243 " - Thanks . " Calling 1243 . One moment , Sir . " " The subscriper could not be reached . The subscriber is reportedly on vacation and will be back the 16th . " - Vacation ? When was it reported ? - " One moment . One hour ago " . Doctor Holst . Your coat . How did it go ? Steinmetz passed away . Ohh my , I thought you 'd never make it ! You won 't get rid of him so easily . How come you look like that ? - What 's the matter with you ? - Nothing . There you go . A cigar as a goodbye present ? Did the police finally catch your stalker ? My stalker ? Yes , the man who claimed to be you . Ahh , no ! And I think they 'll have a hard time ever finding him . How the hell did you get this ? I doubt you 'd believe that story anyway . How could anyone ?

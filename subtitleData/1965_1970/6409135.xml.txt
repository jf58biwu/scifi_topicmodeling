 [ theme music plays ] [ birds chirping ] [ car drives past ] [ birds chirping ] [ honking ] [ traffic humming ] [ Boy ] Go away . Go away . Leave me alone . Go away . Go away , will you ? [ brakes screech ] [ screeching , crashing ] [ bell ringing ] [ driver ] He walked right under me . Right under my wheels he walked . He didn 't look . He just walked under me ... [ groans , wretches ] [ dog barking ] [ children 's voices ] [ panting ] [ child laughing ] [ baby crying ] [ train approaching ] [ cutlery clattering ] Where do you think you 've been ? I asked where you 'd been ! I asked you a question ! Wash your hands before supper . How often must you be told never to go out alone ? Do you want us to be forced to move home again ? Do you ? - I 'm talking to you . - Oh , Charles . Don 't raise your voice . There 's no harm done . Let 's have supper and forget it . [ groans ] There was a man following me . What happened ? I made him leave me . Well ? I think he was killed . How ? I didn 't mean to hurt him . He walked into the road and a lorry knocked him over . - Then it was an accident ? - Yes . Nobody could blame you for that . There is another one of them downstairs . How do you know ? Was he with the man who was killed ? - Did he see what happened ? - I don 't think so . [ doorbell rings ] When I reached the flats , he was waiting on the steps . I suppose we will have to move again . Oh , God ! - Yes ? - It 's a bit of cheek really . I wonder if you could spare a drop of milk ? Oh , my name is Brown , I 've just moved in next door . - Milk ? - It 's too late for the shops . I can let you have it back tomorrow . - I 'll see . - Thanks . Oh , it 's all right , darling . It 's , er ... This is Mr. Brown ... My wife . - How do you do ... Mrs. er ... - Wilson . Mr. Brown would like to borrow some milk . - Certainly . - Thank you . Sorry to barge in while you 're in the middle of supper . We hadn 't started . Nice flats , aren 't they ? Nice view . [ traffic humming ] Balcony and everything . I reckon I was dead lucky getting that place next door . I hadn 't realised it was empty . Oh , I know a chap who knows a chap , who knows a chap . The word gets around in my line of business . This looks interesting . - A hobby ? - My son 's . Gross Fertilisation . Mendelism , forecasts and results . He 's still at school , then ? No . I help him occasionally . You 're in this line yourself ? Yes , I 'm a lab assistant at a Secondary Modern school . Important job . It 's one step above the caretaker . Elm Bank is a fine school . Our whole future is in the hands of the scientists . It beats me how you can bear the responsibility . And your boy 's following in your footsteps . - His soup 's getting cold . - He 'll come when he 's hungry . He 's old enough to look after himself . - How old is he ? - Eighteen . Now is there anything else you 'd like to know ? Parentage , politics , blood group , ... Being neighbours , I was interested ... I 'm sorry ... Is that enough ? Thank you , that 's fine . I 'll return it tomorrow . Please don 't bother . They never stop trying , do they ? [ Evans ] But this case is going to take its own time . All we can do is follow it ... Exactly , sir . By which time we may all very well be dead . Hall . A stupid accident . At least it must have been instantaneous ... It would not have happened if he had followed instructions ... Oh , yes , sir . Another man was ready to take over . [ Brown , on voice recorder ] This looks interesting . Hobby ? [ Charles , on voice recorder ] My son 's . [ Brown ] Gross Fertilisation . Mendelism , forecasts and results . He 's still at school , then ? [ Charles ] No . I help him occasionally . [ Brown ] Oh , you in this line yourself ? [ Charles ] Yes , I 'm a lab assistant at a Secondary Modern school . [ Brown ] Important job . [ Charles ] It 's one step above the caretaker . [ Brown ] Elm Bank is a fine school . How are the plants coming on along , Charles ? Cross-fertilisation . Do you know , that 's something I 've never thought much about . No joy ? Looks as though we 'll be walking up again . Ah ... I suppose you 'll be going to university next , eh , Charles ? I would like to , Mr. Brown . I never had the chance , more 's the pity . You didn 't have the brain either , Mr. Brown . [ chuckles ] Yes , yes . Quite right . Seriously though , Charles . Why don 't you drop in for a chat some time ? I 'd be very interested to hear about your experiment . I was discussing it with your father the other day , and ... he was telling me ... [ tapping ] Why this experiment again ? We 've been through it all so often . Cross a giant bean with a dwarf bean . Result , a hybrid . The seeds of the hybrid produce one quarter pure dwarf , one quarter pure giant , and one half hybrid . It happens every time . I 'm waiting for the one that 's different . That 's highly improbable . Like me ? I happened . - Why ? Why am I different ? - I don 't know . I 'm a mutant . I 'm an improbability that happened . I want to know how . You will have to wait a long time . Your accident at Harvard ... How could that have affected me ? I know I make mistakes . I try not to , but it is natural for me to use my will . Then we have to move again . So I have to be insulated against the world . Whatever we do is for your own good . And what about my children ? Will they have to be looked after too ? They will be like me . Like me . A sharp cry breaks the shell , and the flowers ... I can 't talk . I must think . Listen , Boy . Outside there swarm the ordinary millions . When they stumble across something they 're not used to , they panic . They destroy . I don 't want you to be destroyed . This one will be different . How do you know ? It feels purple . Or not really purple , but you 'd understand purple better than , a coiled spring laughing , or ... It 's a different world for these , of course . The colours call , and the flashes of bar waves ... [ train whistling ] He must have gone out again . Oh , Charles , I 'm frightened . [ Charles ] For him ? Or of him ? My own son ... My own darling son . You said you knew him well . Yes you did . You said I 'd got the job . Not ... Well ... All I said- - [ sighs ] He didn 't know who you were . God , I felt a fool . He obviously didn 't get my letter . I wrote to him- - You 're lying . - I am not lying . - Why say it ? To impress me ? - You call yourself an agent . - I wish I was just your agent . I do the best I can with what you 've got . - You need me , more than- - - I don 't need you . I can sell myself , thank you . On a postcard in the newsagent 's window ? Yes . If I 'm a whore , you 're a pimp . A pimp . [ shouting ] Get your hands off me ! - Hop it . - Leave her alone . Get back to your ice-cream cornet . - Leave her . - Buzz off . Go away . Look , sonny . Do you want your bottom smacked ? Go on , go away . You 're not allowed in here anyway . Go away . Yeah , well , the air 's fresher outside anyway . Thank you . Same again , please . [ church bell chimes ] I 've been watching you . I want to talk with you . - Has he really gone ? - He had to . You must have a way with you . What 's your name ? Paula Wilde . I 'm an actress . Haven 't you seen me on television ? No . " Pussyfish . Pussyfish for pretty pussies . " And I toss a fish to the pretty pussy . My name is Charles . Charles Wilson . - My parents call me Boy . - Oh , Boy . Here , Boy . Good Boy . Perhaps Sonny could fix a commercial . I could toss a bone to you . Can we spend the evening together ? What ? You 're joking . - You 're too young . - Please . Hmm ? Come on , I 'll buy you a drink . Sonny 's going to be furious . [ indistinct bar room chatter ] I 'll have a large gin , please . And ... - Oh , half a bitter , please . - Half a bitter for my son . [ Paula ] Mind your head . Here we are . Miss Paula Wilde 's penthouse . It 's handy . Straight from the cooker to the table . Or just straight from the cooker if you 're in a hurry . The bathroom 's through there . The bedroom 's through there , but that 's not an invitation . Why did I bring you here ? Come and have a cup of coffee . [ stove lighting up ] May I kiss you ? You 're very young . Very pretty . [ squeals , exhales ] Come on . [ pots clanging ] - What ? - Your hands . [ trembling , gasping ] Your nails . It doesn 't matter . It doesn 't make any difference . [ gasping ] I 'm sorry . Let me explain . You can 't help the way you 're made . Will you stay still and let me explain ? I 'm sorry . Please will you stay still ! I don 't want to hurt your feelings . Stay still . [ Boy ] Kiss me . See ? It doesn 't make any difference . [ Paula ] You made me . You made me . You made me kiss you . - You made me kiss you . - Miss Wilde . - You made me kiss you . - Please be quiet . Be quiet ! Keep quiet ! [ muted screams , silence ] What on earth 's going on down here , with all that noise ? What 's been happening ? Miss Wilde ? [ agonised screams ] [ Charles ] Stick your head in a noose for a girl like that ? I expected a son of mine to have more self-control . - And more sense . - I didn 't know what to say . Oh ... I only hope she 's too big a fool to use what she knows . Bring the sugar . [ incoherent conversation in next room ] Drink up . [ groans ] I ... I couldn 't help it . Can 't say ' no ' , can you , pussy ? I wanted him to go , wanted to get rid of him . But he said , " Kiss me " . All he said was " Kiss me " , and I had to ... He could have made me do anything . I 've warned you about playing with strange boys . I couldn 't scream . They turn nasty when you change the game . You know what he can do , don 't you ? He made you leave the pub . That 's why you came straight over when I phoned . What do you mean ? ln the pub . He told you to leave . If anybody else had done that , you 'd have kicked them in the teeth . But you just went . I just felt like leaving . I was fed up with rowing with you . Sonny , you know he can do it . I know he can do it . If he 'd told me to go and cut my throat , I 'd have done it . Nobody could do that . - Hypnotism ? - No . How does he do it , then ? However he does it , pussy , you ought to take lessons . " Give your pussy her Pussyfish . " I could sell you then , pussy . You could write your own contracts . Why , if anybody could do that ... Where does he live ? I don 't know . Why ? I don 't really believe it . But you never know . [ shuddering ] He 's not normal . - We ought to tell the police . - No ! I might be making a fool of myself . So , what ? What have I got to lose ? - You 'll help , won 't you ? - Help ? He likes you . Fetch him back . Let him touch me again ? He 's attractive , pleasant voice ... Well , you never know , pussy . This might be something really big . - Want some ? - Yes , thanks . They drove away in her car and I lost them . There 'll be a next time ... - Pepper ? - Mmm . ... if she 's what he wants . And I rather suspect she is . Yeah . The family is scared . But then I suppose they must always be scared of something . Why do they call him " Boy " ? What is he ? Something ... Something rare and wonderful . At present , we don 't know how rare or just how wonderful . - Remember Hitler ? - I 'm old enough . Every now and then , history throws up a man with unusual powers of persuasion . On his account , steady-willed , strong-minded men behave out of character ... irrationally . Remember Napoleon ? Or Joan of Arc ? I 'm not that old . [ light chuckling ] There 's the Don Juan legend . The ability to influence another mind must be there ... in the brain . Rather like our powers of reasoning . But imagine that highly developed with an extra sense . - Then you have ... - Him . But there is a great deal more to him than that . The appendix , the tonsils are two physical organs that we don 't need but they give us a lot of trouble . There are vast areas of the brain equally outdated useful only when we lived in caves . From our observations , I would say that he was born without these defunct handicaps and that he is really a wonderfully efficient machine . The tragedy is he is not allowed to be at present . It is our duty to see that he is . My bottom 's getting sore sitting around . Events may be moving towards some sort of climax . The girl may give us our opportunity . [ birds chirping ] [ Boy speaking , indistinctly ] Look , I 'll show you what else I can do . Right . Cycling ... [ excitedly ] Tommy Simpson , leader of today 's yellow race ... He 's gone from 36th to 6th position in the tour from Dax to here ... All the way , in the third stage , and the third lap , of the Tour de France ... [ shouting in background ] He fell out of the race today , because he found that he couldn 't cycle any further ! [ excited mumbling ] He sat on the side of the road , and wept , while he- - Stop ! Stop it , I believe you . And look ! I 'll show you what else I can do . [ shouting in background continues ] Just don 't say anything , but just , think of your name . Now don 't tell me , just think of your name . Georgina , is that right ? Wait a minute , now think of your surname . Cleary , is that right ? Yes ! Now , listen , I 'll tell you what your name is . Don 't tell me what it is , just think . You 're Alexander , aren 't you ? Yeah , that 's right . [ mumbling ] Now , don 't tell me , what school do you go to ? Think of it ! Birdshead Secondary Modern ! That 's right , isn 't it ? Is that right ? - Your name 's John ! - No . Yes , it is . You 're lying . You 're trying to trick me ! His name 's John , isn 't it ? [ children ] Yes ! And you 're his brother , aren 't you ? Yeah ! That 's right , I can tell you 're his brother . What 's your name ? Don 't tell me , just think . - You 're Ronald , aren 't you ? - Yes . That 's right , now tell me , where does your aunt live ? Tell you what , what 's your aunt 's name ? Amy ? - Is that right ? - Yes ! She could be one of them . A decoy . Have you thought of that ? Yes . - She could make him leave us . - I 've thought of that too . What happens to him then , for goodness ' sake ? He ends up in prison , or on an operating table . - Yes . - Oh , God ... I wish he was dead . Charles , I 've said this before . We must go to Australia . They need scientists . A trained scientist would be welcome there . It would be the same there . [ train rumbles on tracks ] [ train clunking ] I think you ought to know something ... I 'm a mutant . Mutant ? Well , mutation means change . It 's a secret . You won 't tell anyone . Then why tell me ? Because I am different and you must know why I 'm different . Don 't tell me too much . - I trust you . - Then you shouldn 't , Charles . This is a hard world . That 's what I 've learned . You 've got to be harder . You 've got to grab what 's going while it lasts . There won 't be any second chances . I learned the hard way . Ants believe they own the world . - Go on . - You understand ? No , but don 't let it stop you . You were telling me about yourself . Oh , yes . You see , dead men grow , like a great railway line , link by link because the spark holds steady from then till now and curves out as far again ... And shells and rocks and leaves and water in a kind of music ... - Will you do something for me ? - What ? The man you met with me the other night ... He 's my agent . He finds me work . He 'd like to meet you again . Yes ? All right . Yes , well . Perhaps I could do something for you . I am always on the lookout for fresh talent . That 's why I 'm here . I 've got an office in the West End naturally . But , you see , I really believe in ... You have that something extra . Personality ? I felt it the other night . No hard feelings , by the way ? Drink ? You might just have what I 'm looking for . He 's got more than that . He 's too intelligent for ... See ? You 've impressed Paula already . [ clears throat ] Anybody with a knack like yours could have the commercials right there . Right there . Big money ? You don 't know what big money can do , Charlie . It can buy dreams . Mind you , let 's not talk too fast . I 'm not yet 100 percent convinced that you can , in fact , reach the standard I 'm looking for . Paula tells me you 've got it all , but she 's biased . - I 'd like a demonstration . - No . - Make me do something . - No . Very well , then . Make me do something I wouldn 't want to do . - No . - Show him , Charles . It 's too dangerous . [ scoffs ] I knew he couldn 't . Miss bird-brain here . Trying to help another lame dog . Sonny , you know he can do it . He doesn 't have to prove it again . [ Paula whispers ] Go on , do it again for me . I ought to knock your silly head off . - Walk . - What ? Walk into the bathroom . - Make me . - Walk . What does that prove ? Perhaps I need a wash . Climb into the bath . That doesn 't prove anything . I don 't mind getting into a bath . Put in the plug and turn on the taps . [ laughter ] Honey , you can 't be ... [ water gushing ] [ Paula shrieks ] [ Sonny groans ] Let 's trying something else shall we ? This is a little uncomfortable . - Lie down ! - [ Paula ] Oh , no ! - Why ? - You can 't ... Look ... [ laughter ] [ groaning ] # I 'm singing in the bath # # Just singing in the bath # Ooh ! [ Paula laughing ] [ stammers ] All right , you 've made your point . That 's fine . I believe you can do it . [ Sonny ] Stop it ! Please ! Please , I demand you to stop it . Oh , this is terrible now . Please stop it . Leave him . [ gurgling ] Get up . [ water dripping ] - Get me a drink . - Are you all right ? A drink . Damn near drowned me . - I knew when to stop . - I didn 't . ln a stupid bath ! You 're a murderous bastard , Charlie , but you 've got yourself a contract . - I don 't want a contract . - Yes , you do . You do . Just like you want me . [ reporter on TV ] Here 's Lester on Royal Avenue who 's owner , Mr. Charleston George , who was dubious about risking him on this very firm ground at Ascot , but after consultation with his trainer , Lester agreed that he 'd probably be all right . You 're a bit on edge , aren 't you ? A dangerous sign . I 've seen it happen before . If only I knew what was happening next door . He 's still seeing that girl . Lucky boy . She 's very attractive . I have to watch and do nothing . Watch them . Week after week . She advertises on television . I 've seen her . They 're trying to get Charles into the same business . - Hello . - He 'll be making a film today . - Yes . - She 's attractive ... Five to win . It makes me sick to think of any girl with that creature . Yes , to win . - Somebody ought to warn her . - Thank you . She knows what she 's doing . If her operation goes wrong , she 'll have to take the consequences just like the rest of us . [ TV blares in background ] Expendable , eh ? Like Hall . He was ironed out by a lorry . He made a mistake . Mistakes aren 't allowed . He got caught in the street ... unprepared . That was Hall 's idea . So easy to pick up an unarmed boy . I didn 't mean that . One shot would be enough . That 's a potential killer next door . An alien . It doesn 't even need a gun . If it had two green heads with horns , nobody would think twice before shooting , but ... because it looks human , it has to live . I could put it out of the way myself , like squashing a spider . I thought you 'd last a little longer . I 'll have to take you off the case . I didn 't mean that . I 'm tired ... I didn 't mean ... You stay here until I send a replacement . But there 's to be no violence . That is an order . I didn 't mean ... I was tired , and seeing this girl ... I can 't afford risks . A life is precious . That alien brat 's life ? No . Yours . Evans ? - [ Sonny ] God , where is he ? - [ Paula ] He 'll come . What if he doesn 't ? I 'm responsible for delivering him to the studio . That boy could shoot my reputation to bits . - You 've thought about it ? - Yes ! Look , Mother , I 'm late . She 's waiting downstairs for me . So you realise what will happen if you make this film ? Yes . They pay me a lot of money . It 's for you too . Look , your face is going to become familiar . People are going to recognise you . Will money be so important once they know about you ? Paula wants me to make the film . When your father talks about the mob , he 's not exaggerating . When a mob panics , it can destroy . Why else have we kept you away from the world all these years ? I must do this for Paula . She 's the only one who even tries to understand me . She 's the only person who treats me like a human being . I 'm not going to let you do this to us . We 've made too many sacrifices for you already . [ lock clicks ] Open the door . Mother ! Open the door . Mother , will you unlock the door ? I 'm late . Mother , unlock the door . Unlock the door . - He 's not coming . - He will . Everything laid on . Car . I transport him wrapped in cotton wool . All he has to do is meet us round the corner . Where is he ? Perhaps he 's come to his senses . What 's bugging you ? Him ... and a cheap commercial for cigarettes . Commercials keep you fed . [ car horn honking ] - Drive around the block . - There 's no point . It 's wrong for him ... There 's something in him like ... like electricity . It could light things ... Life ! And what are we using it for ? To sell cigarettes . - There 's money in it . - Oh , sure . If only you could sign up the Archangel Gabriel . He 'd go down great with detergents . [ groans ] He 's not coming . They 'll go mad at the studios . [ low knocking ] [ car horn beeps outside ] Well , just dropped in for a chat ? I have to ... Most visitors use the front door but I suppose that 's too ordinary for you . I was locked in . You can 't run through a chap 's living room without as much as " How 's your father ? " At least stop long enough to have a drink ? I have friends waiting downstairs for me . Another day . There won 't be another day as far as I 'm concerned . I 've been waiting weeks for this . Still , better late than never , as they say . I have friends waiting for me downstairs . They won 't have to wait as long as I did . I must go . You could make me let you go . Couldn 't you ? Could I ? Why don 't you ? Make me let you go . I 'm in a hurry . You couldn 't ? A big boy like you ? - Please . - Make me . Make me . There 's something heavy in your pocket . A gun ? Don 't let that worry you . - The red-headed man with a gun . - I 'm a traveller , you see . I do a lot of travelling with valuable samples . Gun comes in handy . And , what happened to the red-headed man with a gun ? - Did he shoot himself ? - I don 't know . A man would have to be out of his mind to do a thing like that . You don 't think somebody else took a shot at him ? No . He shot himself . Did he now ? Why don 't you sit down for a minute ? - I 'm late . - Take the easy chair . Are you going to sit down ? - You have a gun . - I 'll let you into a secret . This gun isn 't loaded . Which might prove to be a good thing , eh ? I can 't be persuaded to shoot myself if the gun isn 't loaded . But just to show there 's no ill feeling , I 'll put it on the mantelpiece . Charles , I 've got something very important to tell you a matter of life and death , so will you sit down ? Please . I 'm late . Will you please hurry ! That 's better . I didn 't know you had hands like that . Didn 't you ? Nobody told me . Well , well , well . - Unusual . - Unusual ? That really does make you different . None of the others had hands like that . - Others ? - Ah , I could be ... I could be shot for letting that out . But I reckon you 've a right to know . I guess you thought you were the only one . With your capabilities , I mean . Capabilities ? Well , let 's say , for the sake of argument , that you have capabilities . There are others with your capabilities . They all live together in an old castle with lovely stone walls and towers , just like in a fairy tale . Each one thought he was alone , until we brought them together . Now wouldn 't you like to join those others ? Must be a lonely life on your own . I 'm sure you 'd be much happier , if you joined them . Slipped up on that one . - Better put it with the gun . - Don 't put it down . - But I must . - Hold it . Don 't put it down . You can 't put it down . No , no . Don 't do it . You see , I was trying to help you . No , don 't . Not me . Not with this stuff . No , no- - Keep it going . I want to have another look at this . It 's the last time I do anything for that Sonny chappy . They are here , Jim . He 'd better be good after this . Jim , I 'm terribly sorry . I do apologise . Hello . - Well ? - Suicide . - Huh ! - Any other theory , Swain ? - The boy ... - Suicide . That boy should be out of the way . Agreed . For his sake . Hence my interest . But the putting away must be legal . After this ? There 's no law against being a fool ... ln this country , people just can 't disappear . They do . Not with articulate parents behind them . Wilson knows his rights . An unorthodox bid for Boy , by me , and I get a writ of habeas corpus instead . [ recording of Boy and Mr. Brown ] [ Boy ] There 's something heavy in your pocket . A gun ? [ Brown ] Don 't let that worry you . [ Boy ] The red-headed man with a gun . [ Brown ] I 'm a traveller , you see . I do a lot of travelling with valuable samples . Gun comes in handy . That 's why the case takes time . Every step has to be legal . I hope I 'm not trespassing . I missed my son , I think he may have come here . He may have done . I 'd like to have a few words with you , if I may , Dr. Wilson . - My name is Evans . - Yes , I know . Dr. Evans , the professor of genetics . Yes . Just talk to me . ln a few moments the camera will come in but don 't pay any attention to that . Just ... Just persuade me . Understand ? Persuade . Half the fellows round here don 't smoke ... make them . Right . Let him go then . [ director ] Let 's have a rehearsal . I hate waste ... That 's why I 'm anxious the boy shouldn 't be hurt . - He 's important to me . - He 's important to us . I need your co-operation . He is our son . We can take care of him . We have experience . You 're not the only ones . Nor is your son . There 's the bookmaker 's son from Durham . A child of four from Northampton . A little girl in Edinburgh . All more superbly equipped than Charles . And others . It was a difficult business getting them into my department , and it 's a complicated matter keeping them there . But they are happy , because they are allowed to develop , freely . Then other parents have had the same ... If it 's any comfort to you your husband 's accident in the research centre a year before your son was born had nothing to do with the child being a mutant . How did you find him ? Pure chance as in all such cases . The medical report on the hand abnormality at birth found its way to me . I have a complete record of your life since then . Why is our son malformed ? I beg your pardon ? Why is our son malformed ? You must be aware of something as elementary as the De Vries theory . That evolution isn 't a gradual process but takes leaps forward . ln this present , precarious civilisation which we live , this mutation I 'm investigating is not without interest . When the mutants were first persuaded to live together ... I noticed a struggle for supremacy going on among them . But the conflict was entirely in the mind . There was no physical struggle , as we know it the strongest will was the winner . Ah . Of course , once an order had been established , they settled down contentedly enough . Well , there , it seems to me is nature 's answer to the tendency of the human race to commit suicide . If this , erm ... If this new species survives , then wars as we know them will end . Of course , we 'll be back numbers , you and I. But at least there won 't be the danger of the world being blown up . There will be a future . This new strain must have every chance . That 's why I need your son . - Will you co-operate ? - How ? I need you to persuade him to enter my establishment . - He 'll be well looked after . - A laboratory ? We do our best to make them comfortable . ln test tubes ? Charles is a person , not a specimen . That 's an unfair and unjust judgement . Condemn him to life imprisonment , while you ... While you have time to experiment on some new investigation . What kind of parents do you think we are ? Dr. Wilson , you 're a scientist . You respect facts . You must realise the only chance for Charles is to be looked after by an established authority . You 're talking like a white paper . There 's only one chance for Charles to survive and that in my laboratory . I want to see what sort of man he 'll make . I want him to live that long . Smoke Oakleaf . Only Oakleaf is good enough for you . Light one now . Taste that special Oakleaf flavour . Light an Oakleaf , now . Now . Now . [ laughter ] Light an Oakleaf . Now . [ cheering ] [ overlapping chatter ] [ Paula ] Everybody in the studio is smoking Oakleaf . It 's fantastic . [ Sonny ] Enjoy yourself ? [ Paula ] How do you do it ? Couldn 't we take a chance ? Stay on here ? After all that Evans said ? - What can he do ? - Nothing at the moment . All we can hope for is to give him the slip now . At least we have experience and the law on our side . Yes . What will the law say about the dead man next door ? Charles , we are not going to give in now . We are going to do what I say , we are going to go further away and try another country . I am so tired of it all . [ door opens ] [ Boy ] It was a success . There are some sandwiches in the kitchen . As soon as you 've had eaten , we 're leaving . Leaving ? The man next door died this morning . - He killed himself . - Yes , we believe you . You 'll leave with your mother . I 'll stay here to clear things up . When she finds some place where we can lie low , I 'll join you . Abroad . I 'm not leaving . You 'll do what 's best for you . Darling , a man came asking for you today . His name is Evans . He wants to shut you behind stone walls for the rest of your life . I 'm not leaving Paula now . She 's done enough damage already . But she 's the only person who 's ever made any attempt to understand me . Look , we can understand . These things hurt at the time , but you 'll recover . You understand everything , don 't you , Mother ? Except me . Oh , please . She understands me . She accepts me ... even my hands . I 'm not something peculiar . Who said you were ? To her , I 'm not something that has to be looked after in case I make a mistake . I 'm a real person . Charles , will you help me with the bags ? Yes , this one ? I come to life when I 'm with her . - I 'm not leaving . - You can 't throw your life away - just for some ... - I 'll take the risk . Now , look . You 've got to trust us , Charles . I trusted you this morning , Mother . You locked the door . You won 't trust us , but you trust that girl . Do you know what you mean to her ? You 're just here to make money . She wheedled you into making that film for her boyfriend . - He 's only works ... - Oh , grow up , child . He 's living with her , sleeps with her ! I can ... Crawling things eating fire . Net pouring burning slime . - I hate ... Light splitting ... - Where are you going ? Light splitting ... [ water rippling ] What 's so different about him anyway ? He 's just a kid . It will wear off . I told you . I just like being with him . You have the sweetest way of showing a chap to the door . You 'll wait while I put my shirt on , won 't you ? I 'm sorry , Sonny . Sooner or later you 'll be back for the old bread and butter . You had your fun . Pardon me while I slip into something . [ door slams ] It 's all right . He 's going . Pick up that knife . - What ? - Pick up that knife . - Why ? - Pick it up . Pick it up . No . I haven 't hurt you . You mustn 't hurt me . You mustn 't make me . Sonny . Help me . Kill him . Kill him . Kill him ... [ Sonny ] What you doing with that knife ? [ Paula groans and wretches ] [ Paula wretches violently ] [ knocking on door ] [ Paula retching , sobbing ] You don 't know me . My name is Evans . I 've come to help you . [ Paula sobbing , groaning ] Danger , you say . [ sobbing ] Stone walls ... - We came here together . - To shut me away . A word from me could avert a prosecution . I must have your co-operation . Get away from me . All of you . Get away . You 'll be quite safe with me . You can trust me . Trust ... Be like me ... Men with crutches dancing . I can 't . Trust no one . I can 't . - I have to call an ambulance . - All right . Back into colour . Before it snapped . [ Paula sobbing loudly ] I 'm sorry , I hadn 't realised just how ... Even side by side , there are universes between us . A crack in the ice and the gap grows wider . I accept what I am . I didn 't do it . He made me . He made me . I must be completely what I am . I accept myself as I am . That way I can grow . I 'm ready to go now . [ Paula 's sobbing continues ]

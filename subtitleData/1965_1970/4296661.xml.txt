 [ Man Narrating ] Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze ... of past and future ages ... during the first experiments on America 's greatest and most secret project - the Time Tunnel . Tony Newman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new , fantastic adventure ... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time . - [ Gunshots ] - [ Men Shouting , Whooping ] [ Shouting , Whooping Continue ] - What 's goin ' on out there ? - Evenin ' . - [ Gunshot ] - Those men - - Saturday night . Just the Triple " " X " boys comin ' into town . Into what town ? We didn 't notice the name as we came in . Lincoln . Pride of Lincoln County ... and of the great territory of New Mexico . You 'll never guess who 's under that hat . Reckon you never seen his face . Not many folks have . I got the drop on him last night . Evenin ' , Deputy Hayes . Evenin ' , Billy . Yeah , you 're gettin all prettied up , ain 't ya ? [ Chuckling ] Oh . This yours ? [ Men Laughing ] I think you need a little more soap . - Maybe a little bit there . - [ Men Laughing ] - I beg your pardon . - [ Men Laughing ] - The keys . - [ Jangling ] Oh , Billy . [ Laughs ] - Hello , Billy . - Good to see ya , boys . May I ? [ Chuckling ] [ Sighs ] Mighty sorry you interrupted me last night , Deputy . You a friend of his ? I never saw him before . Then why did you try to save him ? 'Cause I don 't like to see anybody murdered . And I don 't like anybody putting ' a hand on me . Well , maybe you don 't know who I am . No , I don 't . The name 's Bonney . William Bonney . - Billy the Kid ? - The same . Billy ? Shouldn 't we get outta here ? No hurry . First I gotta settle with these dudes here . Bring ' im over . - Look , you don 't understand . - Oh , I understand . - You two are friends . - [ Men Laughing ] Look at the clothes they 're wearin ' . Is that what they 're wearin back East these days ? Huh ? Ooh . Very sporty . - They look sweet . - [ Laughing ] [ Man ] You all right in there , Hayes ? Kid , we got visitors . [ Man Chortling ] Heh . Tell you what , sport . Turn around . Maybe you can make it to them horses out there ... before some vigilante puts a slug in ya , huh ? Go on now . I 'm givin ' ya a sporting ' chance . - [ Men Laughing ] - Like you gave that deputy ? I don 't like that kinda talk , dude . - Now move . - It 's your move . You 've got the gun . I haven 't . Maybe you 'd like to do a little dance for the boys . - Huh ? - [ Men Laughing ] All right . ! Drop it . ! Drop your guns over there . Drop ' em . ! - Tony ! - [ Horses Whinnying ] Ho ! Ha ! Get outta here ! Well , go after ' em ! Go on ! [ Narrator ] The Time Tunnel . He 's dead . - Oh , hey , Billy . - Here . Billy the Kid . And Doug 's killed him . I don 't understand . We 've never before changed any recorded event in history . Billy the Kid was killed by a sheriff , a Pat something . - A famous gunfighter . - Garrett ? There has to be a mistake somewhere . Ann , what 's your time fix ? 1 881 . Sometime late in April . Spatial coordinates ? Longitude . Latitude . Thank you . Hmm . Well , it seems to be somewhere in the Southwest - Arizona , New Mexico . - How long can you hold the fix ? - It 's slipping a little now . Same pattern it usually follows . We 'll probably lose contact for a few hours and then pick them up again . - Ann , get a research report on Billy the Kid right away . - Yes , sir . And particularly the time and place of his death . I understand . Keep whatever contact you can , Ray . I 'm gonna verify these spatial coordinates . Boys , we can 't let the Kid stay here . Chuck , give me a hand . Bi-Billy . Billy , you 're alive . Boys , the Kid 's alive . Don 't move . - Wait till we find out where you 're hurt . - I already know . Right in the belt buckle . Knocked me cold . - [ Laughing ] - Gee , you lucky - The dudes hightailed out of town . We got a couple horses out back . - We can still catch ' em . - You and the boys stay out of this . - I 'll pick up his trail alone . - But , Billy - You heard him . Go get your horses and get outta town . Hey , Kid . I been thinking . We don 't know who this dude is . He might be some real hotshot from up north . - Could be . - He handled that gun like he knew his business . Maybe he 's workin for Pat Garrett . - What are you gettin ' at ? - [ Laughs ] I 'm goin ' with ya . Not this trip . [ Exhales ] Suppose this dude is a big gun from somewheres . I don 't plan to share him with anybody . - Now , Kid , I - - Not even you . Hyah . ! [ Laughs ] Okay . [ Wind Blowing ] I don 't think we should stop . We can 't go on riding blindly in the dark . Besides , we 've got to get some rest . Maybe we can hole up in here . What about that shack ? There might be somebody inside . I 'll take a look . It 's empty . That settles it . At least we 'll be out of this wind . You killed a man back there . You can bet they 'll be coming after us . We 'd better get these horses out of sight . - Anything ? - I 'm getting indications of the fix again . - We should be establishing contact soon . - Good . - I checked out the spatial coordinates . - Where are they exactly ? The town of Lincoln , county seat of Lincoln County , territory of New Mexico . Yeah , well , that checks out with the biographical data . Billy the Kid spent his last years in and around Lincoln . - What else do you have on him ? - Some of it 's not too reliable . There were so many legends about him , it 's hard to dig out the facts . - Seems he was born on the Lower East Side of New York City . - I never realized that . And his name originally seems to have been William H. McCarty . I thought it was William Bonney . He took the name William Bonney when he drifted into Lincoln County . By that time , he had killed nearly a dozen men ... and he was known throughout the Southwest as Billy the Kid . What about his death ? That 's the information I really want . We should be making contact any moment now . Let 's see . Death . " " He was shot to death by Sheriff Pat Garrett ... during the night ofJuly 23 , 1 881 . " According to our fix , that 's a good three months from now . Yet we saw Doug shoot him right in that jail less than 1 2 hours ago . Ann , does your research give you the names of the men he killed ? Yes . Let 's see . " " Number of known killings : 21 . " - And here are the names of all but two . - All but two ? He killed " " two strangers . " Those are the words used here . " " Two strangers near Lincoln sometime in April 1 881 . " Oh . I know what you 're thinking . But if Billy the Kid is already dead ... Doug and Tony don 't have any worries on that score . We can 't be sure he 's dead . And if he isn 't , we 'd better try to move Tony and Doug out of there fast as we can . - I agree . The sooner , the better . - We 're getting an image . Well , at least we 'll have light . - I 'd just as soon not draw a crowd . - Hey , you 're right . Here . Throw this saddle blanket on the window . Okay . [ Blowing ] Anything to eat in those saddle bags ? - Not unless you like raw leather . - [ Scoffs ] That 's no joke . It may come to that . It 's almost as cold in here as it is outside . Maybe we can get a fire going . No , wait . They might spot the smoke . Besides , we 'll be moving out at daybreak . I don 't know if that 's a good idea . The more we move around , the harder it is for the Time Tunnel to get a fix on us . - Well , we 'll see . - Tony ? What did history have to say about the death of Billy the Kid ? There are so many different legends about him , it 's hard to say . I 'm grateful to him for this coat anyway . - Go ahead . Switch them . - I 'm trying . Nothing 's happening . - No , it 's no use . I was afraid of this . - Afraid of what ? The draw on our power supply has been too heavy . - How long will it take to recharge ? - Several hours at best . [ Object Clatters ] I wonder how far it is to the next town . Could be two miles or 200 miles . Either way , we can 't stay here . The Kid 's gang will be hunting for us . The more miles we can put between us and Lincoln , the better . [ Sucks Teeth ] Besides ... I could sure use some vittles , partner . [ Chuckles ] You still look like a tenderfoot , son . - I just can 't get used to it , Tony . - To what ? That I killed him . You did it to save my life . Remember when he called us " " dudes " ? Maybe he was just trying to scare us . Doug , Billy the Kid was a cold-blooded killer . Now shake out of it . Okay . Saddle up for me , will you ? I 'll get the rest of the stuff . Hello , dude . Nice morning ' , ain 't it ? You look almost happy to see me . [ Chuckles ] In a way , I am . You 're not makin ' sense , mister . I should 've known I couldn 't kill you . You 'd have cut me half in two if it weren 't for my buckle . No . With a buckle or without . - My bullet couldn 't kill you . - Keep talkin ' . [ Exhales ] Well , this isn 't gonna make much sense to you , but , uh ... I couldn 't kill a man who died before I was born . Nobody really knows what time is about or how it operates , but , uh - I 'm actually alive in this time now , but - I won 't be born for 50 years yet . Nobody pulls my leg , mister . You 'll never stay alive with a wild story like that . - What 's your power input ? - It 's far too low , General . It 'll be hours yet . He 's going to kill Doug any minute . Can 't we do something ? Without power , what can we do ? What about a voice transmission ? Ray , what do you think ? We might have enough power for a short transmission , but only a few words . - It might be enough to save his life . - But I warn you - It will delay our trying to switch them . What 's the good of saving power if one or both of them are dead ? Right . We 'll try the transmission . - Can you arrange a hookup for me quickly , Ray ? - Yeah , we can . I 'll do it . You ready to tell me the truth now ? - I have told you the truth . - [ Sighs ] I always figured a man oughtn 't to die with a lie in his mouth . - Get on over there with your friend . - I thought you were - I was dead ? You 'll wish I was . Now move . Now , tell me . Did Pat Garrett send you to get me ? - We don 't know any Pat Garrett . - That 's what I told him . Well , Pat and me has been friends a long time . Close friends . Now he 's sheriff , he 's out to get me . He wouldn 't be above hiring 'a couple of guns ... from outside the territory to do it either . I reckon , if I was in his shoes , I 'd do the same . Anyway , I gotta kill ya both . I can only give you a second or two , General . It 'll have to do . Give me a signal when you 're ready . If all this talk about time travel is true ... you won 't feel this bullet for ... half a century or so . [ Laughing ] - Right here . - Now . [ Kirk ] Billy the Kid . ! We 've got you surrounded . Come out with your hands up . ! Who 's there ? Quien es ? Get that rope . Don 't make the same mistake I did , mister . Blaze away . We 'll take care of you our way . - That was Kirk 's voice . - Yeah , I know . Is that another one of Pat 's boys ? How many you got out there ? There 's nobody out there , Billy . That was a voice from the future . There you go with that time talk again . With his gang on the loose , we 'd never get him into town . Maybe I should bring Garrett here . I think you 're right . Take this . Wait a minute . Don 't forget . Everybody in town saw us ride out last night after the killing . - They might just shoot first and ask questions later . - I 'll watch it . Wear this . You 'll attract less attention . Yeah . Nobody 'll give ya a second look . How much power did we consume ? Nearly all our reserve , I 'm afraid . - We 've spent all that we were building up ? - And more . It couldn 't be helped . Switch off the image area . - We 've got to try and save all we can . - Right . It 'll be hours now before we can try a switch . But with Billy the Kid under control , they should be safe enough . [ No Audible Dialogue ] - Mister ? - Yeah ? I 'm lookin for Pat Garrett . I 'm sorry , mister . I 'm busy . That stranger up there 's lookin ' for Pat Garrett . He 's got a gun full of notches . It 's the Kid . Poe ! - What 's the matter ? - It 's Billy the Kid . Huh ? Yeah . That 's the Kid all right . I 'd recognize that hat anywhere . What 's he wanna come back here for , especially after a killin ' ? He 's gunnin ' for Pat Garret . He came right out and said so . Yeah ? Here . That 's nine shot in each barrel . Between the two of us , that 's 36 buckshot . I reckon that 's enough to stop anybody , even Billy the Kid . All right . Let 's get out of sight . Don 't take another step . - Are you Pat Garrett ? - You know Pat Garrett as good as I do . Another move like that , and you 're dead . Now , just raise those hands up nice and high in the air . Come on . - What 's all this ? - No mistake . Nineteen notches . - Look , I wanna talk to Pat Garrett . - Oh , I just bet you do . Well , Pat 's away , and I 'm in charge here . I 'm John Poe . I 'm his deputy . - In that case , I can tell you . - You can 't tell me nothin ' , William H. Bonney . - Alias Billy the Kid . - What ? In the name of Lincoln County , the territory of New Mexico ... I hereby arrest you for the willful murder of Deputy Hayes . You 'll be given a fair trial , and , in less than a week ... you 're gonna be hangin by the neck until you 're dead . Now wait a minute ! [ Billy ] Hey , dude . I got a powerful thirst . So have I. There 's a water tank out back . We 're big boys . Let 's try to hold out . I want some water , and I 'm gonna get it ! Come on ! Shoot me ! Shoot ! Huh ? Come on ! Do it ! [ Grunts ] Look , I 'm not Billy the Kid . Kid , I never thought you 'd be the kind to deny yourself . Look , Pat Garrett can tell you I 'm not . - When 's he comin ' back ? - Don 't matter even if he doesn 't . You mean you 'd try me without - without someone to swear who I am ? Oh , I 'll swear who you are . So will old McKinney here . Neither of you ever met Billy the Kid in your lives . We got your hat . We got your gun . - [ Crowd Chattering Outside ] - We got you . You can 't convict a man on that kind of evidence . - [ Chattering Continues ] - McKinney ! You got Billy the Kid in there . - We want ' im . ! - [ Crowd Clamoring ] Kid , you might never even get to a trial . [ Laughing ] [ Bucket Clatters ] [ Horses Whinnying ] That 's ours . One of them 's still here . Take a look around . [ Object Clatters ] Wilson ? That you , Wilson ? - Billy . - Get me outta this . I warned you about that dude . - Is he still here ? - Well , I saw his horse . - [ Doug ] Hyah . ! - [ Hoofbeats Galloping ] It 's the dude . Go after him . Come on . Billy , come on . Didn 't ya hear ? It 's the dude . Oh , can 't be . He 's not even gonna be born for another 50 years . - Billy , you all right ? - [ Chuckling ] Come on . I know just where he 's headed . - How 's the power input now ? - It 's still low , General . It 'll still take several hours at least . We used up so much on that voice transmission . They 'd be dead now if we hadn 't . If there was just some way to speed up the recharging . I know , Ann , but we 're straining now to the ability of the complex . Yeah . - We all feel the same way , Ann . - [ Exhales ] We 'll shift them the moment we can . Yeah . - [ Shouting ] - Come on ! - [ Man ] Come on , McKinney . ! Get him out here . ! - [ Crowd Clamoring ] - Throw him out here ! - The sheriff . - Pat Garrett ! - [ All Chattering ] Hey , Garrett . We got Billy the Kid . It 's Pat . He 's back . Pat Garrett ? - [ Crowd Clamoring ] - That 's right , Kid . Your old friend . You 'll be glad to see him , ain 't ya ? [ Laughing ] Now you 'll find out I 'm tellin ' the truth . I 'm no more Billy the Kid than you are . ... springing ' their friend the Kid outta jail . [ Shouting ] They 're gonna hold him in there now . - All right , all right ! - [ Crowd Quiets Down ] Pat , we got the surprise of your life in that jail . We sure got us a prisoner . [ Laughing ] He 's a friend of yours . Billy the Kid . [ Laughing ] [ Crowd Chattering ] Of course , he keeps denying ' that he 's the Kid , but he 's the Kid all right . Pat , you know he had the gall enough to walk right in here as big as life . Here 's his gun . Take a look at all them notches . - Nineteen . Right , McKinney ? - That 's right . McKinney , you should be over there on that door . How about that hat ? Huh ? Now , if that ain 't the Kid 's hat , I 'll eat it . There he is . Yes , sir , we got him dead to rights . [ Chuckling ] Go on . Tell them . Have you ever seen me before ? Hello , Billy . I don 't know why you 're lyin ' about me . Well , son of a gun . He still denies it . Ha ! Bet he 's planning his defense . [ Both Laughing ] Come on , Sheriff ! . Let us have him ! - Yeah . ! Bring him out here . ! - McKinney , go out there and see if you can 't slow them down . - [ Clamoring ] - What are we waitin 'for ? Take it easy , men . The sheriff just got here . Give him a chance . We wanna invite him to a party - a necktie party . - The sheriff knows what he 's doin ' . Take it easy , men . - [ Clamoring ] Take off his cuffs . - You sure that 's what you want me to do ? - Yeah . All right . [ Clamoring Continues ] Pat . They 're gettin ' mean out there . Can 't hold ' em . Open up the cell and let him out . - Pat , are you outta your mind ? - No , I ain 't outta my mind . Just open up the cell . Look , you 're the boss here . You can have my badge anytime you want . But I ain 't gonna let him out - not Billy the Kid . Now , come over here and take a look at him . - What are you talkin ' about ? - Come over here and take a look at his neck . Yeah . I see what you mean . That neck ain 't seen much of New Mexico sun , has it ? Take another look at him . Well , now that you mention it - He 's got Billy 's clothes on , but they don 't set good on him , do they ? That 's because he ain 't Billy the Kid . - Then why did you say - - I seen his hat , and I seen his gun . I thought Billy might be up to some of his old tricks . Sheriff . - We got Billy the Kid . - How 's that ? My friend has him tied up in a shack not too far from here . Well , I think you 're outta your mind , son , but you hold that thought . - Men . - Hey , Sheriff ! . We want the Kid . ! Bring him out . ! We 're gonna string him up , Sheriff ! . - [ Crowd Clamoring ] - We want the Kid . ! Bring him out . ! Turn him over to us , and nobody 'll get hurt . - All right , men . Men ! - [ Crowd Quiets Down ] - Men , you all know me . - Yeah , we know ya . - Turn over the Kid , Garrett ! - That 's right . ! You know me . You know I never turned a prisoner over to a mob in my life . Just ' cause he 's your pal don 't mean you can save him . - We want the Kid . ! - Now you listen to me and pay me some heed ! Even if the man I got inside was the Kid , I wouldn 't turn him over to no rope . And you know it , but he ain 't the Kid . - You expect us to buy that ? - What about the hat ? - You just listen to me . - And that gun with all them notches on it . ! Just listen to me and give me a chance to explain . - [ Gunshots ] - Get inside . Looks like somebody 's gonna get killed before this is over . Pat , they ain 't gonna wait to look at that young fella 's neck . They gonna stretch it . You could be right . But I got an idea how we can stop that mob . How you gonna stop that mob ? They want blood . I figure on usin another mob to do it . - What are you talkin 'about ? - When I was comin ' into town ... I passed the Murphy boys rounding ' up some of their stock . About 200 or 300 head , I reckon . Poe , you think you could ride out and stampede them animals through town ... with the help of the Murphy boys ? - You mean into town ? - Right through the mob . I don 't figure they 'd stand around and ask questions . Do you ? Well , now . [ Laughs ] If that ain 't the doggonedest thing I ever heard . I hate to ask you to play yellow ... but that 's the only way you 're gonna get through out there . You want me to walk through that crowd with my gun in my holster ? Yeah . All right , Pat . I 'll do it for you . And you 're gonna see the doggonedest stampede you ever saw in your life . [ Crowd Clamoring ] Where is he , Poe ? Bring him out . Tell Garret we don 't care if the Kid is his pal . Boys , I 'm with you . - I 'm givin ' Pat back his badge . - [ Badge Clatters ] But I 'll tell ya one thing . You 'd better think twice before you go rushing ' in there . Those shotguns make pretty big holes . [ Chattering ] McKinney , save your neck while you can . You might have a chance , son , but it 's all riding ' on that stampede . Let 's get that desk over here . Where 'd you get that hat and gun ? I told you . We captured him . My friend 's got him . - How many men you got guarding ' him ? - Just my friend . I 'm sorry to hear that , son . Not for Billy , you understand . For your friend . - [ Gunshots ] - Better get down if you wanna stay alive . Won 't they listen to reason ? This ain 't a reasonable town , son . Well , Doug 's all right . - Can you get a fix on Tony ? - I 'm trying now . Signal 's fairly strong . Ray ? How long before we can switch them ? We 're getting there . Less than an hour now . Good . - Now , ifTony 's all right - - [ Cattle Bellowing ] [ Bellowing Continues ] - [ Whistles ] Hyah ! - [ Gunshot ] - [ Gunshots Continue ] - [ Bellowing ] [ Crowd Clamoring ] - What 's happened to your deputy ? - I don 't know . But if he don 't hurry up , it sure ain 't gonna matter much . Come on , Sheriff ! . You 've had enough ! Give him up ! - Come in and get him ! - Well , let 's go ! - [ Crowd Shouting ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire Continues ] Get over there and hold ' em off as long as you can . - Stampede ! - Stampede ! - [ Men Shouting ] - Here comes your stampede . - [ Shouting Continues ] - It 's workin ' . It 's workin 'just fine . Let 's get out of here while we still got time . You think you could lead me to where your friend 's keepin ' Billy ? - Sure . - Okay . The Kid and the sheriff - They 're gettin ' away ! [ Horses Whinnying ] - I reckon we lost ' em . - Looks like it . - Which way now ? - Down there . Whoa ! Something 's wrong . What makes you say that ? I don 't know . Doug 's horse is gone . We had him tied up . Suppose you just hand that gun over nice and easylike . - Why ? - Do it , mister . - What 's the idea ? - That 's my question . Just what kind of wild goose chase you takin ' me on , huh ? The Kid was here . My friend was guarding him . - One man guarding ' the Kid ? - We had him tied up in this chair . Looks to me like your friend made a mistake , son . My guess would be it 's the last one he 's ever gonna make . Catchin ' an outlaw like Billy ain 't no business for amateurs . Wait a minute . If he did ambush Doug , he would 've killed him , wouldn 't he ? Quicker than you can spit . - And he certainly wouldn 't stop to bury him . - Not Billy . There 's no blood on the floor . Your friend might just have gotten lucky . If Doug got away , he 'd head back to town lookin ' for me . And Billy 'd head for town lookin ' for him . - I 'm going back there . - They want your neck in Lincoln . I gotta find Doug . You 're gonna need a caretaker , son . [ Clicks Tongue ] Well , I reckon I 'm elected . [ Horse Whinnies ] Anybody here ? - Hey , Kid . I saw him . - Which one ? - The dude - the one who tried to kill ya . - Is that a fact ? Yeah . Oh , I coulda plugged him myself , but , uh - Well , I figured you wanted to . - [ Cylinder Snaps ] - Wilson ... you figured right . [ Chortling ] In another minute , he 'll go back on that street . And when he does - - How long , Ray ? - Not until we have full power , General . It won 't do us any good to try to switch them a moment before . But exactly how long ? Five minutes and 1 6 seconds . That may be too late . When he steps into the street , that outlaw will kill him . There 's nothing we can do now but wait for the power charge . Right in the sheriff s office . Hey , dude . Start walkin ' , dude . When you think you 're close enough to hit anything ... draw . [ Garrett ] Billy . Stay outta this , Pat . Draw . - Howdy , Pat . - Billy . Here 's another one for you , Sheriff . Much obliged , son . [ Garrett ] Let 's march on down to the office , shall we , gentlemen ? You hit ? I guess not . [ Out Of Breath ] But I sure thought I was gonna be . Pat . Look . Those dudes - They disappeared . Now , you don 't expect me to fall for an old trick like that , do you , Billy ? Move on , men . [ Men Shouting ] Tony . [ Cannon Fire Continues ] [ Shouts ] - A pack of cowardly wolves preying on unarmed ships . - You 're a brave man , Captain . You 're also a stupid one when you talk too much ! Shall we say you talked yourself to death ? Hampton , get him out of my sight . All right . Who 's next ? I got a couple of strange-looking ones here , Captain . You heard him . Move ! - If he won 't walk , drag ' im over here ! - Leave him alone ! Ain 't you the brave one ? I oughta cut your ears off and use ' em for fish bait . Now , what have we got here , huh ? Let 's see your hands . No calluses . Give me your hands . You 're not seamen . A couple of rich young gentlemen perhaps ? You 've made a mistake , Captain . We haven 't got any money . Don 't lie to me ! Must be someone willing ' to pay a ransom for your release . I have some relatives in Philadelphia . Only trouble is they haven 't been born yet . No money and no friends . A very sad and dangerous situation for you . All right , Hampton . ! Take these scum away and shoot ' em .

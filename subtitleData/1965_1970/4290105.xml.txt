 What seems like a fairy tale today may be reality tomorrow . Here we present a fairy tale of the day after tomorrow . There are no more national states , only mankind and its colonies in outer space . We 've settled distant stars ... and the bottom of the sea has been made habitable . At what are today unimaginable speeds , the spaceships of tomorrow traverse the Milky Way . One of these spaceships is the Orion , a small part of the giant security system ... which protects Earth from extraterrestrial threats . Let us accompany the Orion and her crew ... on their patrol-route at the edge of infinity ... Earth Outpost Station 4 calling space cruiser Orion . Orion 7 , respond . Respond and give coordinates , over . EOS 4 calling Orion ! Orion 7 , respond ! Respond and give coordinates , over . Hasso ! Jupiter Outpost Base to high-speed space cruiser Orion 7 . You are ordered to immediately return to Earth . This is an Alpha Order from the Supreme Space Command- - Special order for Orion 7 . Immediate return to Space Station 13 . Orion , come in ! This is an Alpha Order from the Supreme Space Command . Reverse course at once ! Mars Outpost to EOS 3 . Orion is underway at hyperspeed towards space sector 71-K ! Orion , attention ! Orion , respond ! This is an Alpha Order ... from the Supreme Space Command . Commander ! Resonance contact ! Orion 7 here , Major Cliff Allister McLane commanding . To Supreme Space Command , Section 12 Astrosciences Department ... via Jupiter Outpost and EOS 3 . In order to test my theory that a landing on Rhea is possible , we will be setting down there momentarily . Orion , over and out . Prepare for landing . General , the chief of the Space Rapid Deployment Force is here . Send her in . General van Dyke , you know why I called you here ? I can imagine . Is about McLane ? Indeed it is , General . That unauthorized landing on Rhea has put his neck in a sling . Yes , he landed on Rhea against orders . But it was a brilliant feat of space navigation , wasn 't it ? But he ignored an Alpha Order directly from the Supreme Space Command ! I know very well how much you 'd like to see ... Commander McLane a convict working in the phosphorous swamps . Let 's get to the point , General ! Personal sympathies ... or antipathies can play no role here . The fact is , as of now , McLane has been transferred to the patrol service ... of the Space Reconnaisance Forces as punishment . As McLane 's superior , shouldn 't I have been informed ? That 's why I asked for you to come . McLane and his crew will be here soon . I see . I 'm to join in the execution ? It 's out of my hands . Mark my words , General ! I regard this punitive transfer as the biggest scandal in the space fleet ! You do ? And McLane 's escapades ... and constant charging off on his own aren 't scandals as well ? His insane flight to the second moon of Jupiter ? His mad breakthrough to Saturn Base during Space War 2 ? His unauthorized interference at Alpha Centauri ? And on and on ! These were not scandals ? Without men like McLane , we might have lost both of the space wars ! Perhaps , but ... But we 're here to discipline McLane ! Putting McLane on patrol duty , General ? Better to simply cashier him outright ! Don 't be overly dramatic , General . No man is irreplaceable . In a few years our cruisers will be manned entirely by robots . And the front desks of generals ' offices , I hope . General ? The crew of Orion is here . Send them in . General , shouldn 't we first bring in that officer from GSD ? Yes , of course . See to it . Yes , sir . Lieutenant , if you please . Is McLane so theatening that he needs a spook on board ? Assigned by the Supreme Command , I 'm afraid . I cannot refuse . Lieutenant Tamara Jagellovsk , Galactic Security Department . This is Gen. van Dyke , chief of the Space RDF , including , until now , Orion and her crew . You 're familiar with the reports , records , and disciplinary proceedings regarding the Orion matter , Lieutenant ? Yes , General . And do you understand your duties and mission aboard that ship ? I was briefed at GSD headquarters , sir . As Orion 's security officer , you 're to prevent the following : Oversteps of command , violations of space fleet regulations , transgressions of military discipline , and to report accordingly . Those are my orders , sir . Don 't go easy on McLane and his people , Lieutenant . You may depend upon that , sir ! You are rather young for such duty . Not a great deal of experience in the galactic service ... I come recommended , General . Fair enough . Send in McLane and that gang of his ! Yes , General . Commander , if you please ... ? Commander McLane and the crew of Orion reporting , sir . The Interplanetary Space Commission 's Board of Review ... has ruled on your case , Major . Your posting with the Space Rapid Deployment Forces ... has been cancelled as of now . You all are hereby transferred to space patrol duty . For how long ? For three years ! And the reason ? Major McLane , kindly spare me ... another tedious recitation of your assorted hijinks . From now on , Major , the slightest violation ... of the regs will bring your dismissal . Do you read me , Commander ? General , if the defense staff wishes it , I will resign from the space fleet immediately . You will shut your mouth , McLane ! Don 't act like some insulted space cadet ! That way you 'll be back with me in only 3 years . Do you read me ? Yes , General . General ? That 's a bit better . Now then , you will be under supervision . A Galactic Security Department officer will be stationed with you . General , sir , you can 't seriously- - No comments , please . May I present your future security officer . Lieutenant Tamara Jagellovsk . As I 'm sure you know , McLane , GSD officials can issue Alpha Orders . I hope you 'll give her no trouble . I hope so as well , General . Good . I therefore issue you and your crew ... your first assignment as a unit of the space patrol . Your mission begins tomorrow at 1800 hours ... from Deep Sea Base 104 to patrol space sector 219-33-9 . Your orders , Commander : patrol , protect , and control all spacecraft ... and traffic in your assigned sector . An order fit for a cadet , eh , General ? Consider it more of a pleasure cruise . You could use it . Is that clear ? Perfectly , sir . My adjutant Mr. Spring-Brauner will brief you on your sector . Space sector 219-33-9 , McLane . The neighboring sectors are none of your concern . Do you read me ? Yes sir , General . Thank you . May I beg a moment of your precious attention ? He 's asking for it- - No , Hasso ! Not him . Weren 't you leaving ? Another cognac ? No , no , nothing more for me . I really have to go , Cliff . I should have been home two hours ago . So go ! Yeah ... I guess I 'm dragging my feet here . Say , what did you just ask me ? Ask you ? Yeah , you just asked me something . Unless I 'm wrong , I think I asked if you wanted another cognac . Yes , I will ! But then I must go , or else Ingrid will be mad at me . With good reason . Sure you don 't want to drop by my place ? Oh , Lord , is it that time already ? Yeah , well , I promised her . And how often have you promised her ? She keeps believing it every time you do ? I 'm serious , Cliff ! I quit ! As serious as all the other times ? Listen , you gotta talk to her . Sure , sure . I don 't dare go home without you . Now you don 't have to . Look . Oh , hell . She found me . Check , please ! You wouldn 't leave me in a lurch , would you ? No , no , no , it 's on me . It looks better if we 've paid already . Good idea . Darling ! Hello ! I was just leaving . Hello , Major . Hello . Hasso , do you really have crew meetings in here ? Just some , Ingrid . It depends . Uh-huh . I 'm getting the picture . Like I said , we were just leaving . I asked Cliff to come along for a beer . What ? ! Aren 't you happy I 'm going out with my boss ? Hasso , whenever you bring your boss along , I know what it means . Well , yes , Ingrid . You see , McLane was thinking , uh ... Yeah , Ingrid , I was thinking , um ... How do I put this ... ? You needn 't explain anything , Major . Hasso 's going out again , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Yes , Ingrid . I was thinking that it 'd be best ... if I went out this one last time . Seeing how we 're so popular now with the higher-ups . They 've even foisted a GSD officer on us ! It 's not a good time to break in a replacement for Hasso . I can never stand up to your excuses , can I ? Cliff . She actually laughed ! Let 's just call it a smile . This calls for a drink ! Come on ! Base 104 to Xerxes 9 . Stand by in holding area 9 until further notice . Roger . Ground control to base . All systems on Orion 7 are checked . She is cleared for launch . Thank you , ground control . She will lift off in a few minutes . Xerxes 9 to Base 104 . When are you giving us landing clearance ? The base will be clear momentarily . Stand by in landing position until further notice . I 'd like to point out that we 're coming in from Andromeda 17 Beta 12 ! Understand ? ! We 've been in space 18 weeks and we 've had it ! Sorry , Commander . Orion 7 's blocking the bay at the moment . McLane ? He 's in the SRDF . What 's he doing at Base 104 ? You can ask him next time you see him in the Starlight Casino . Hah-hah-hah . Patch me through to Col. Mulligan , then . I request we be rerouted to another base . Sorry , but the second galactic fleet is occupying bases 81 through 106 . Besides , the colonel 's on vacation . Vacation ? ! Are you- - Commander Stein , you 've been in space 18 weeks . Do you really want to risk disciplinary action ... because you couldn 't wait another 5 minutes ? We 'll talk later , baby . Gladly , Commander . But what would your wife say ? Computer checked ? Course programmed in properly ? Yeah , the smartass is working . But don 't even ask about ... the gorgeous enchantress I had to blow off for this ! Nobody asked . She was- - Onboard control , please , Lieutenant de Monti . Onboard control , aye . Lt. Tamara Jagellovsk , Galactic Security Department , reporting , sir . Control center on-line , Commander . Commander to Astrogator , set autocontrols . Autocontrols set at CD minus 10 , sir . Space monitor running . Receiving beam . Orion ground base in contact with Earth Outpost Station 4 . This is Base 104 launch control to high-speed cruiser Orion 7 . Cleared for lift-off . Thank you , Base . Base 104 , handing off to EOS 4 . Preflight , complete . Initiating acceleration . Commander McLane , may I point out that- - Lt. Jagellovsk . I need neither your assistance nor your oversight for launch . Now , please go to your cabin and switch on the onboard intercom . It 's a small button there marked OIC for " onboard intercom . " If you wish to see me , the visiophone is at your disposal . In your closet you will find your luggage , 12 months worth of food rations , and a paralyzer pistol , in case you wish to paralyze yourself . If it all becomes too much for you , you 're free to make use of our cryosleep chamber . You 'd like to put me on ice , wouldn 't you , Commander ? What I like doesn 't seem to count for much here . Now please go to your cabin . If something happens to you , I might be accused of attempted murder . IG , on . Drive to 05 . You staying up here , Hasso ? My control board 's set to automatic , sir . Then we 're set . Let 's do this ! Twenty . Nineteen . Eighteen . Seventeen . Sixteen . Fifteen . Fourteen . Thirteen . Twelve . Eleven . Ten . Nine . Eight . Seven . Six . Five . Four . Three . Two . One . Zero . If anybody 's interested , we 're passing Luna 1 . Are the hydroponics tanks pressurized ? Yeah . Our nanny won 't suffocate in her cabin . You want to keep her locked in there the whole trip ? I doubt you can . We 'll break this spook , I promise . Or she 'll break us . I don 't want to cross her . Neither do I , which is why I have other plans . Big words . Like you have a chance with her . Oh , darling Helga , are you jealous ? Me ? ! Ha-ha-ha ! The point 's moot . In my opinion , that 's a robot disguised as a girl , not a real woman ! We 'll see . Why don 't we check what she 's up to ? Looks like she changed outfits . Ah ! How neat and tidy she is ! You think she 'd clean up my cabin , too ? Are you nuts ? ! We don 't do that here ! You want to see or talk to her , then call her on the OIC , like normal ! Sorry , Cliff . But she did have her clothes on . Go on . Lt. de Monti to Lt. Jagellovsk . Can you talk ? Please switch on your visiophone . Yes ? Just a casual question for you . Would you , um , like to share a drop of whiskey in my cabin ? You have whiskey ? But of course , my dear ! A whole crate of it ! Very interesting . Thanks for the information . Unfortunately , I 'll have to report that . Astrogator to Commander . Alpha-priority dispatch from solar weather station Dragon . Putting it on the speakers . To all stations , eruption fields forming in sector 207-24-8 . One is moving towards sector 211-21-9 ... at a speed of 38 to 42 units . Eruption duration is 27 minutes . Radiation levels 150 times normal . Cut the autonav , Hasso ! Man your station ! We 're changing course ! Changing course ? Then I request you inform EOS 4 ... of the change at once , Commander ! Impossible during a solar storm ! Space monitor , raise our protection field ! EOS 4 doesn 't care if we change course ! They can 't help us . Solar eruptions cause rad levels to jump up to 10,000 times normal ! I insist you inform EOS 4 , Commander ! MSBTUSER : POSX = 360 ; SNAPX = 1 ; POSY = 411 ; SNAPY = 1 Be that as it may , Lieutenant , radio communication breaks down ... during a solar storm ! Perhaps I should send them a postcard ? ! We did it ? We always do . If the radiation is 10,000 times the normal levels in space , why doesn 't Orion need a protection field 10,000 times stronger ? The shield is naturally set to repel the highest levels of radiation . Following the Cascade principle , we- - Who cares , Helga ? Can you hold your beginner 's course someplace else ? What 's eating you ? # 264 has worms . Oh , the poor thing . It 's not eating anymore . No ! And I 'm not with him . Oh , that really is awful . Please , what is # 264 ? His dog . A poodle . One of the last 376 poodles left . And that 's a problem ? ! We 're caught in a solar storm , and he worries about a ... ! What was that ? What ? We 're exploding ! Well , that 's an occupational hazard for spacemen ! Commander , aren 't you going to do something ? ! Indeed , I am . And that is ... ? Have something to eat . A fine idea ! May I join you ? Naturally . Onion soup or pepper steak ? I 'll have strawberries . Enjoy your meal ! What is the Cascade principle ? I tried explaining it , but ... Lt. Shubashi , you think I 'm a total moron , don 't you ? God forbid . Major McLane was just looking for an excuse to change course ! Say , you took us awfully close to that radiation storm . It shook us up pretty nicely . Why ? Aunty GSD doesn 't like us to change course , so I changed it as little as possible . That 's why it was a little rough . Oh , I get you . I hope she gets the message , too . You think that 's the way to get rid of her ? Well , you do what you can . Still , she 's pretty , isn 't she ? So 's a cobra . One thing 's for sure , she won 't last three years with us . Either she ends up in the nut hatch after three missions , or else ... Or else ... ? She 'll be in command . Range : 33 / 5 , 30 , 29 . Passing at 26 . Any signs it 's functioning , Atan ? None . Just hanging out there like a dimwit . It 's a broken Sky-77 radio satellite . Probably from Terra Cosmo control . It was probably blown here by that solar eruption . Well , it 's dead , anyway . Let 's shoot it down , Mario . Aye , aye , Cliff . Are you authorized to simply shoot down radio satellites , Commander ? My dear child- - I 'm not your " dear child . " I am the designated GSD officer aboard this vessel ... and I forbid you to shoot that satellite ! It has a value of 12,000 credits ! A corpse , as they say so well , has no value . It is a hazard to every spaceship crew within three sectors ! You don 't think a space station or outpost somewhere ... already knows the satellite is inoperative ? Even I don 't know how many satellites , probes , and automated radar stations are out here . Perhaps 25,000 ! And there was that little solar storm we had , too ! Careful , Commander . A tech support vessel is probably already on its way here to examine it . You will not eliminate it ! Lt. de Monti , enter this into the log . GSD officer Tamara Jagellovsk forbids us to fire on the radio satellite ... at coordinates such-and-such and so-and-so . The commander is going to bed now . I 'm afraid you won 't be sleeping , Commander . We 're passing by MZ4 . And ? Clarence isn 't hailing us . What ? MZ4 isn 't hailing us ? That doesn 't sound like Clarence . Try it again . What 's MZ4 ? A communications relay station set up a few years ago . And who is Clarence ? Chief of the station and our friend . If he 's not answering , he 's either drunk or dead ! Anything ? Nothing . That 's impossible ! Orion 7 to MZ4 . Clarence , please respond . We just want to say hi . There we go ! Like hell . Those are trinary groupings . I 've never heard anything like them ! Should I record them ? Yeah . I want to know what 's going on here . Commander , we 're ordered to reach our mission area quickly . Gimme a sec ! Listen to this ! MZ4 's gone crazy ! A totally crazy , nonsensical code ... Is knowing if MZ4 has gone crazy or not part of your orders ? For our part , Lieutenant , I wonder what 's up with our buddy Clarence . To our security officer , however , I have a different answer . In 48 hours , the unmanned laboratory cruiser Challenger ... will pass by MZ4 . It needs to get a course correction from them . If it instead gets what we 're picking up here , it 'll be a disaster . The cruiser will run straight into the planetoid . Am I clear ? Clear , but ... Is there no way for us to radio the course correction to Challenger ? I might have been able to do that , but you forbade me to shoot down that dead satellite . That dimwit junkpile you care about so much ... is jamming the frequencies in the area Challenger is . So , what do we do ? Land on MZ4 and try to fix what 's wrong . After you 've already made an unauthorized course change ? Naturally . Flood magnetic cushion , cut engines , generators off . Orion , flooding magnetic cushion . Range : 800 . We can 't get any closer . MZ4 is too small . Relative speed : zero . I 'm still getting those trinary groupings , but I can 't tell from where . That 's why we 're here . I need two volunteers . Why do you even bother asking ? Nobody ever volunteers . Fine , Hasso , you can go then . And , um ... Take Atan with you . Prepare Lancet 1 in launch bay 1 . And put on your pressure suits . Pressure suits ? The oxygen generator on MZ4 works as well as ours ! If their com system 's broken , their O2 system may be broken as well ! Now , man the Lancet ! Why are you doing this , Commander ? You wouldn 't , in my place ? I follow my orders . So do robots ! Meeting you has made me appreciate robots even more . They at least know their obligations . Then why do we even need humans ? Good point . A robot would take little time to find out what 's wrong down there . Ah . Lancet 1 , preparing to launch . Your course is programmed in . Lancet 1 , FORB check , please . Fuel ... Oxygen ... Radio ... Batteries ... FORB check , clear ! Cliff , we 're all set . Then send them off ! Stand by , Hasso . Ten . Nine . Eight . Seven . Six . Five . Four . Three . Two . One . Zero . Should we put these things on here ? You heard him . If the com system 's broken , the O2 system may also be broken . Check your pressure indicator . Barely any oxygen , like we 're in a deep sea aquarium . Their hydroponic plant must be broken . Yeah . And the lights don 't work , either . Funny . Funny ? Yeah , I 'm laughing already . Look ! It 's tuned to a frequency we never use . This isn 't right ... Where the hell are they ? ! Who ? Clarence and the crew , who else ? ! Who else , indeed ! I get the feeling someone else is here . My God ! Jim and Francois ! Dead ! Who dies like that ? ! Mid-motion , fork in hand ! There 's lots of ways to kill someone , but what we see here ... ! You think it 's because of the O2 plant ? Impossible ! Do they look like they suffocated ? But , then what ... ? The ventilation system . My God , Hasso , what was that ? ! Nothing human , that 's for sure ! The beam just went right through it ! Exoterrestrials ... There 's no time to lose ! Sigbjornson on MZ4 to Orion 7 ! Sigbjornson on MZ4 to- - What 's up , Hasso ? Everyone 's dead ! Clarence and the whole crew . You hear me ? ! Understood , Hasso ! Explain ! There 's an exoterrestrial here . An alien ! What , in this area ? Impossible ! Even so , Cliff , they are ! And they 're immune to our beam weapons ! Where are you ? In Clarence 's control room . Did it notice you ? Yeah . I don 't know why it didn 't kill us like Clarence ! Double-time it back to the Lancet ! Get back here at once ! Sure thing , Cliff . We 'll try . Prepare for emergency scramble ! Man your station ! Begin constant space monitoring ! Alien life forms in our galaxy ? ! MZ4 lies right on the edge of no man 's land . But are there signs of- - Your anthrocentrism is quaint in this day and age ! There are 4 to 10 billion worlds in the Milky Way , and some of them must support intelligent life ! It 's the height of arrogance to believe ... we 're the only ones who learned to add and multiply ! I 'm not stupid , but in theory- - Did Hasso 's report sound very theoretical to you ? ! Orion 7 to Engineer Sigbjornson on MZ4 . Hasso , where are you ? Can you take off ? Sigbjornson here . We 're en route to the landing bay , Cliff ! Still no further contact with them ? No , but don 't ask me why . Continuing to the landing bay . If they killed Clarence and the others , why don 't they attack Sigbjornson and Shubashi ? I can 't read minds , let alone alien ones ! Cliff ! Unidentified flying objects ! What ? ! Four ... Five ... No , seven ! Give me a visual ! Range ? 40 / 9 , 39 / 8 , 38 / 6 . My God , Cliff , their speed is fantastic ! We gotta get out of here . We 're sitting here on a platter for them . Initiate scramble ! What about Hasso and Atan ? My God , where are they ? ! Hasso , Atan , what 's up ? ! Are you in the bay ? Why haven 't you taken off ? We 're in the Lancet , but we can 't get away , Cliff ! The bastards smashed our electronics ! Dammit , Hasso , we 're under attack ! Seven unknown objects ! I can 't wait another second for you ! Can you scramble without me ? I have to try it ! I have to get in position to attack ! Hide yourselves as best you can down there ! We 'll extract you later ! Over and out ! Course correction , programmed . Mario , we have to be in range in 130 seconds ! And I have a job for you . Send a priority LightCom to the SSC and the TSRF : " Exoterrestrials on MZ4 . Crew , eliminated . " " 7 unknowns approaching . Moving to engage . " Yes , but- - Why are you waiting ? ! I thought all radio traffic here was being jammed ! Why ? ! The dimwit ! Look , just send it ! There 's no time to explain ! Mario ! Search beam , acquired . Objects , marked ! Twelve ... Seven ... What 's taking so long ? ! Five ... Three ... One ... Zero ! Fire throwers ! It 's pointless , Cliff ! They 're not nearly in range ! Cliff ! Cliff , the computer 's gone dead ! What is it ? ! What 's wrong with us , McLane ? ! I 'm guessing mass attraction ! It 's affecting our gravity field ! Cliff , all instruments are down ! They 're jamming our frequency system ! The throwers , Mario ! Fire the throwers ! For God 's sake , Cliff , get us out of here ! We 're helpless while we stay in their gravity field ! Switch to LightCom systems ! Forget it , Major ! We don 't stand a chance ! We have to return to Earth ! Return to MZ4 ! Why MZ4 ? ! I have to try and get those two out of there ! The range these guys have is incredible ! It 's hopeless , Major ! They 'll catch up with us ! What then ? ! I won 't just abandon them ! There 's more at stake here ! Unknown objects have affected Orion in an unexplainable way ! The ship 's electronic brain has recorded all the data on this ! We have to get that data to Earth ! This could be the start of an invasion ! Cliff , whoever they are , they 're years ahead of us ! If they get any closer , they 'll crack us like nothing ! I don 't think they 're after us at all ! I computed their course . They 're headed for MZ4 ! And we 're helpless ! We must do something . Oh ? What do you suggest ? You know Alpha Directive 3B ... for space cruiser commanders as well as I do . Yes . Tell me truthfully , Commander . Is it technically possible to destroy MZ4 ... before they catch up with us ? Technically , an energy blast could do it , but while the smallest chance remains ... that Sigbjornson and Shubashi are alive , I refuse to- - " In the event of forceful entry of a space base by alien life forms , " " it is to be destroyed immediately , without regard to our own losses ! " I hereby issue an Alpha Order to carry out this directive ! You unfeeling- - She 's right , Mario . She 's right . LightCom to the TSRF . From Maj. McLane of high-speed space cruiser Orion 7 . Advised by security officer to destroy base MZ4 via energy blast ... due to compromise of base security by exoterrestrials . Hostile objects approaching at unprecedented speed , therefore we are returning to Earth . Record following losses : Engineer Hasso Sigbjornson and astrogator Atan Shubashi . Over and out . Ready the light throwers . I didn 't think you were capable of that . They 're either dead or in the hands of the exoterrestrials . We have to at least try to make voice contact ! Why , so I can say " Sorry old friends , but I have to kill you ? ! " Where are you going ? You 'd do it for me ? ! Commander McLane- - Commander ? ! The commander quits ! Give it up . They did too good a job . Too true . And here we sit , in their trap . Cliff will get us out of here . If he can . If you ask me , pal , we 're finished . I didn 't ask you ! If they had to fight the aliens , they 're long dead . You forget that guy in the hall ? They 're immune to our beam guns . McLane doesn 't stand a chance ! We 've thought that before many times . Mario . Thrower 2 , standing by . Commander McLane , you must eliminate MZ4 ! Yes , I know I must . But I don 't want to ! I CAN 'T ! Cliff ... Cliff , they 're blocking our energy ! What 's causing it ? I don 't know . But we can 't destroy MZ4 now ! Cliff , they 're approaching ! We have to jump to escape velocity ! We can 't do anything more here . All right , take us to escape velocity . Here they come , Hasso ! And none missing . McLane couldn 't even take out one of those things ! Meaning he 's dead . Just like us , in a few minutes . We 'll take a few of them with us . How ? ! They 're immune to our beam weapons ! Those things are absolutely amazing ! They don 't even need oxygen ! Oxygen ... Oxygen ... Atan , we 're idiots ! It 's not that they don 't need oxygen . It 's probably poisonous to them ! You mean ... ! Yeah ! We have to find the circuits for the hydrotanks ! Here ! What 's this ? What are you waiting for ? ! Kill them ! Turn the oxygen up ! And the others ? What about the ones landing now ? They won 't come in when they see the place is flooded with oxygen ! They 'll have helmets to guard against oxygen , like we have ones for it ! They 'll come in and kill us , like Clarence and the others . Why haven 't they done it already ? ! Like I know ? ! Maybe they want us alive ! They 've trapped us ! They act like there 's nothing to fear . Why ? ! They probably destroyed the O2 plant . I 'll check by flooding this room ! Nothing . Kaput . Would have been a nice break for us . Can you fix it ? We have to try ! Too late ! They 're landing ! Damn it ! Where can we get oxygen here ? On the Lancet ! The oxygen tank ! You want to go out there to get it ? It 's either that or kill ourselves right now ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Those bastards . They thought of everything . We have to get back ! Oh , what 's the point ? What about this ? Doesn 't this have oxygen in it ? ! If we explode it ... ! Will it be enough ? It 's a 90-day supply , which is probably enough for this nutty base ! I can share your supply then ! Okay then ! Come on ! Where are they ? ! Not close enough ! But they don 't have helmets on ! I 'm ready ! Hang on ! What if they come in one at a time ? ! Don 't lose your nerve now ! We have to wait till the last one is in there ! Atan , no ! Not yet ! Here they come ! Now . I always knew I was a genius . Then maybe you can tell me something . How do we get out of here ? Gentlemen , this is no time to be discussing principles ! The situation is that one of our outer bases ... has been occupied by exoterrestrials ! We face a specific threat ! An alien spacefaring race has infringed on our territory ! We had to expect it sooner or later . How comforting your calm analysis is to me ! Did you expect our neighbors would be immune to our beam weapons ? ! And have spaceships that can ... How did McLane 's last message describe them , General ? If McLane 's only option was to run , you know what that means . I 've put the 1st and 2nd strategic space fleets on alert ... and request a deployment order ! If we ... I don 't know if that 's the right thing to do , sir . Oh ? And what do you think we should do ? Just wait till our other bases are occupied ? I just think it 's premature to take strategic measures ... against an opponent when it 's not clear yet if they 're our enemies ! After they kick in our front door and kill MZ4 's crew ? ! An example of good manners , I suppose . The universe contains more galaxies than we can estimate . Can we expect our concepts of " good manners " to be universal ? We had no clue of their existence before this ! Except we 've been picking up signals from alien worlds in space for centuries . MSBTUSER : POSX = 360 ; SNAPX = 1 ; POSY = 410 ; SNAPY = 1 Who cares about alien worlds , as long as they leave us alone ? ! I consider that viewpoint to be somewhat antiquated , sir ! I beg your pardon ! Strange , isn 't it ? We 've advanced and established bases on Mars and elsewhere , yet the attitudes of our generals have been fixed for thousands of years ! If any strangers pop up , we respond with our light cannons ! The question is , do we have any alternatives ? So , Villa , what do you advise ? I advise that before entering into ... wide-scale conflict , we learn the following : First , who they are . Second , what they want . And third , what they can do . What they can do ? McLane can sing you a ditty about that ! Jupiter Outpost Base is hailing us . Cliff ? We 're almost home . Right . LightCom to Jupiter Outpost . Running normally . Request Terra entry coordinates . Commander , I know how difficult this must be for you . I don 't mean to intrude , but ... If it helps , I can speak to Mrs. Sigbjornson . Thanks . I appreciate it , but I have to do it . If not for me , Hasso would be home right now . Cliff ! Cliff , we 're idiots ! We forgot something ! Yeah . Challenger . I know . But , if we don 't do something , the lab cruiser will ... crash into MZ4 in 4 hours ! We have to reroute it ! Why ? MZ4 's in the hands of the aliens . Hasso and Atan are dead . The lab cruiser is fully automated , with no one on board . Just carrying radioactive waste ... Challenger is going to do what we couldn 't . Eliminate MZ4 . Challenger to MZ4 . Challenger to MZ4 . Requesting new coordinates . Requesting new coordinates . Range : 48 / 7 , 47 / 6 , 46 / 5 . Requesting new coordinates . Distance , critical . Distance , critical . Challenger to MZ4 . Distance , critical . Requesting new coordinates . All for nothing ! We survived everything , even the exoterrestrials , and now that stupid lab cruiser 's ... going to come down on top of our heads ! If we 're receiving Challenger 's signals , doesn 't it stand to reason we can transmit to it ? ! Hasso , get it through your head ! They altered the transmitter ! Sorry , but I 'm not one of these Frogs ! I don 't know how to fix the crappy thing ! And you call yourself the greatest astrogator in the fleet ! Challenger to MZ4 . Distance , critical . Distance , critical . Requesting new coordinates . Range : 36 / 5 , 35 / 4 , 34 / 3 , 33 / 2 . Challenger to MZ4 . And to whom do they owe their rescue ? Who blew up Challenger before it could crash on MZ4 ? That would be the Frogs , sir . " Frogs ? " The exoterrestrials . We nicknamed them the Frösche , but that seemed too normal and earthlike , so we decided on Frogs . I thought you 'd already killed the Frogs with your oxygen supply . We had . Fortunately , they 'd erected a magnetic screen ... around MZ4 which destroyed Challenger . They only let the Lancet through , likely to have us as guinea pigs . After that , it was child 's play to fix the LightCom and call for help . Child 's play ? Hah ! It took you 17 hours ! And ? It 's not like we didn 't have plenty of time ! So you thought ! If you 'd known the plan ... was to send the 2nd galactic fleet to destroy MZ4 , those 17 hours probably would have seemed like a damned long time . What ? You were going to destroy us ? ! I suppose we have you to thank for that ! You 're lucky to be standing here thanking anyone . We were convinced you were dead . But if you want to thank anyone , thank my boss here . He prevented them from taking action against MZ4 . You seem to have formed a surprisingly close attachment already . I think Lt. Jagellovsk will get used to us . The future will show who will get used to whom , Major ! One thing I 'll never get used to , though ! Being lied to ! I lied to you ? Naturally ! Telling me that dimwit satellite was jamming radio traffic ! Um , that was ... That was a lie , Major ! And if you think I 'm going to stand for- - Lieutenant , perhaps that 's a problem best discussed ... with Commander McLane over a glass of whiskey . I 'd love it if she 'd have a drink ! Who says I wouldn 't ? ! Well , on the ship , you- - On the SHIP , Major . But we 're not talking about being on the ship now . Now , if we were in the Starlight Casino , well ... See , Commander ? She 's inviting you out for a nice glass of whiskey . The whole thing was a nightmare , wasn 't it , Atan ? Worse ! It was science fiction !

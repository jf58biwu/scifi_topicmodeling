 Two pounds , seven for the Burberry and the hat . There you are . Thank you , sir . Did you come off the Ella Campbell , sir ? Who told you ? Who said I came off the Ella Campbell ? Who 's been spying on me ? Why , nobody , sir . L - I just thought she 's unloading ... I don 't wanna be spied on . Understand ? I 've had enough of that . Yes , sir . No offense , I assure you . Here 's your change , and thank you , sir . I say , uh , I 'm sorry I jumped on you . Quite all right , sir . You see , I 've been away . Have you now ? And where have you been , might I ask ? I don 't know . I 've been lost . And you won 't be wanting these , sir ? Oh , it 's just an old rag . Keep it . I 'm on my way to plenty . Thank you , sir . And good luck to you . Will you join us in a cocktail ? We can 't , Mother . We 're late . It 's his fault . It 's not my fault . It 's my editor 's . You 're a journalist , aren 't you ? Well , that 's nicely put . I 'm a reporter . Oh , but you do write features . Now , Julie , don 't interrupt . You 're stopping at the inn , I believe ? Yes , it 's quite attractive . He says the maids are very pretty too . I say , Julie , I wouldn 't take that bright line with Lady Anstey if I were you . Mark , do you think your grandmother will find me an evil influence ? You don 't know my grandmother . Shall we go ? All right . Are you sure you can 't stay to dinner ? I 'm afraid not , Mother . We 're late already . Good-bye . Good-bye , darling . They weren 't so grim , were they ? No . Did I look as silly as I felt ? I wondered if you felt as silly as you looked . Well ? Well , she might pick worse . Heavens , yes . Best blood in the county . Family , yes . But no money , of course . Well , after all , our grandchildren would hardly starve . Julie . Yes ? A person , SirJasper , by appointment . Appointment ? Yes , sir . He said it 's oflong-standing . - Irene , did you ... - Who is it , Cleghorn ? He said his name is Robert Griffin . - What did you say ? - His name , Robert Griffin , sir . Well , you didn 't hear right . You couldn 't . Show him in at once ! Yes , sir . Why , Jasper , it isn 't possible . It can 't be Rob ! I wonder . But they told us ... Salim swore that ... Hello , Jasper . Irene . Now don 't tell me you don 't recognize me . Rob ! Rob , you old rascal , you . Oh , Rob , my dear ! Oh , thank heaven ... I knew you 'd be glad to see me . My old friends . But how on earth did you ... Where have you been ? Come on . Give me your coat . Sit down . Tell us what happened . Maybe you 'd better tell me . I was a little confused that last day . Well , no wonder . You were burning up with fever . Yes . Fighting our way through that foul jungle . You and Jasper were right behind me . I remember that part of it . And all of a sudden ... I saw it , Rob . The branch , I mean . I saw it fall . I called , " Look out ! " Dear Irene . You did your best , I know . But something hit me on the head ! We thought you were done for . Yes . And you went on without me . Look here , Rob . The supplies were running out , and the bearers were getting out of hand . Do you think I should have stayed with you and sent Irene on alone ? Why , no , Jasper , not for the world . It wasn 't easy going on without you , Rob , but we left Salim with you . The only one we could trust . When he caught up with us , he swore that you had died . You see , we ... we had no reason to doubt him . What happened , Rob , after you came to ? Uh , I don 't know . I don 't remember a single thing after I got that blow on the head . Not until the next blow . That was two months ago . No ! Why , it 's more than five years . I know . And they 're gone , clean gone ! What I did or where I went , it 's all a blank . Until two months ago . And then ? Well , I-I was working on the docks in Durban . That 's where I got hit by a loading crane . And that brought your memory back ? Perfectly . I came to in a hospital in Natal . I knew if I could ever get back to you , my old friends , that you 'd be waiting for me . Oh , but naturally . Waiting to hand over my share , my full share . I 've kept the agreement , you know . Remember how we drew it up in Kalo 's Hotel in Mozambique ? Here . " One-half of any and all properties discovered in the Tanganyika country . " That 's quite right , old boy . We found it , didn 't we ? A whole diamond field . That is , I found it . I made you rich , didn 't I ? Yes , it turned out pretty well for all of us , Rob . What do you mean pretty well ? There was a million in it . There was , but there isn 't now . Why not ? Why isn 't there ? Oh , I lost it , Rob , a great part of it anyway . Bad investments . - Of my money ? - Rob , please try to understand . We thought that you were dead . You were our closest friend . You told us yourself you had no relatives . Oh , who cares what you thought ? The paper says ... But I haven 't got it , I tell you ! I 'll give you half of our own money , more than half . That 's not enough . Oh , please ... I want it all ! You 'll ruin us . Who cares ? You 'll take everything , even Shortlands ? To the last penny , if there 's any law in England . I 've got my proofs . I 'll have you in court . I 'll make your name a byword . I 'll tell them how you tried to murder me . Now , hold on , Rob ! That 's not true . But , Jasper , he 's right . A mere half would be an insult . Don 't worry , Rob . I 'm not the one that has to worry . You 'll get all that 's coming to you . Now , how about a drink ? I think we all need it . Yes . L-I 'll get it . Uh , Jasper . Would you mind poking up the fire a bit ? What will you have , Rob ? Whiskey . Done yourself well , haven 't you ? Is this one of your bad investments ? I didn 't buy Shortlands . It came down to me . Like your title ? Old and honorable , eh ? Stop being sinister , Rob . It isn 't becoming . Here you are . Thanks . A bit smoky , that scotch . I hope you don 't mind . Jasper . I 'm sorry I jumped on you like that . Well , here 's how . Julie ? Yes , that 's Julie . I 'd know her anywhere . I bet you never dreamed what became of that picture you had of her on safari . It was lost . No , it wasn 't . I 've got it . I 've kept it always . I 'm a deep one , you know . I 've always been a deep one . Lay my plans ahead . Why not ? It 's the thing to do , isn 't it ? Marry into some honorable family , good blood . I 'm as good as the next one , aren 't I ? Why , of course , Rob . Well , then why isn 't she here ? She 'll be home tomorrow . Hmm . I ... must spruce up a bit . Never do to see me like this . L ... - Jasper , help him . - Here , hold on now . What 's the matter ? L - I don 't know . L ... Everything is swimming . Sit down a minute . It 'll pass . So much excitement . L - I 'll be all right . Don 't try anything . L - I want my half . L - I wantJulie . He 's unconscious . What 's happened to him , Irene ? The man is definitely psychopathic . You see how one drink has affected his warped mind ? This is not the man we knew and loved , Jasper . This is a madman . He 's dangerous . He honestly believes we tried to kill him in Africa . There 's no telling what he may do when he regains consciousness . We 've got to get him off the property . Yes , I suppose so . It seems brutal , but ... Well , I suppose it 's the best way , for his sake as well as ours . The authorities will pick him up and care for him . I won 't let him ruin our lives and Julie 's . No , no , you can 't do that , Irene . You heard what he threatened . Do you want a scandal ? Do you want him blackmailing us and persecuting Julie ? No , of course not . Then we must keep this and take care of it ... until he 's rational again , and then give it back to him ... and make whatever settlement he feels is fair . Naturally , neither of us want to cheat him out of his rights , but certainly we can 't have a madman roaming about ... with a club like this over our heads . As soon as he 's able to walk ... Well , it won 't do you any good , 'cause I 'll come back , Jasper . I 'll come back . And when I do , I 'll get you and ... - Oh , Cleghorn . - Yes , sir ? If that fellow ever shows his face in here again , send for the police . - You understand ? - Yes , SirJasper . I gotta go home to my ... wife Home to my sweet storm and strife Help ! Help ! Hello ! Help ! Somethin 's happened around ' ere . 'Ere ! Come over ' ere ! Hey , come over ' ere ! Move your hands ! Over ' ere ! Keep it comin ' . ' Ere we are . Give me your hand . Give me your hand . 'Ere you are . Come right up ' ere . There you are . Come on , old lad . That 's the stuff . Get right up there . My word ! What happened to ya ? And if you think of makin ' me an handsome reward for savin ' your life , why , Let 's not talk about it . That is , not now . You know , if half of what you told me is true , we 've got a case against SirJasper and his lady ... that 'll rock this bloomin kingdom to its foundations . Hey , we can make a pretty penny besides too , you know . It 's all true , every word of it . I 've got the proof right here . The agreement , signed with his own handwriting . Half of everything we find , we ... Why ... Why , it 's gone ! Gone ? Yes , they 've stolen it . Are you sure ? Have a look yourself . Did you look in all the pockets ? Most ' struth ! Blimey ! Nipped your papers and tried to drown you besides . A bit nasty , I calls it . Crooks ! Murderers ! If there was only some way I could make them pay . Oh , they 'll pay , all right . Have no fear of that . You don 't think I 'm going to sit still and see me old friend put upon , do you ? Not on your life ! I fight for you and I 'll bleed for you ! Now stop worrying , will you ? 'Cause from now on , I 'm takin charge . What I need is a lawyer . A legal mind , that 's what we need , all right . But who ? Hey , I know the very bloke ! Who ? Jim Feeny . He 's fearless , and you can trust him . A little . I 'll watch him too . Sure ! Look . Me and him , we 'll go marching up to Shortlands tomorrow . And I 'll see SirJasper and I 'll tell him off right to his bare face ! I must remind you , Herbert , of the Law of Criminal Libel . All right . All right . But you ain 't going to look very nice in court ... with charges of murder and robbery against ya . Eh , very grave charges , SirJasper , but , uh , we 're not unreasonable . We 're here to discuss a settlement out of court . Yes . Empowered by my friend and partner , Rob Griffin . And what does your old friend and partner expect to get ? Half . No less than half of what you took out of his diamond mine . And damages to the tune of a million pounds . That 's what we 're gonna ask for , and that 's what we 're gonna get , if I 've got to fight through every court in England , up to the very steps of the throne itself . Excuse me , sir . What is it , Cleghorn ? Her ladyship wishes to remind you it 's teatime . And Sir Frederick Travers has dropped in . Would you please ask Sir Frederick to be so good as to join us here ? Yes , sir . Did you say Sir Frederick Travers ? Yes . The chief constable . Well , what are you starin ' at me like that for , Jim Feeny ? Looks like you swallowed your own Adam 's apple . I 'm not afraid . I don 't care who comes in the room . I have a conscience as pure as a baby 's breath . Now look , SirJasper , how ' bout making a settlement for 50 pounds ? This is me last word . Hello , Herrick . Hello , Travers . Sit down , won 't you ? Well , what 's the latest ? Oh , nothing much , except our friend here is just trying a spot of blackmail . Blackmail , indeed . Blackmail ? When I bring a story here as true as gospel ? Well , if you don 't believe me , ask Griffin . Who 's Griffin ? Some tramp who turned up here yesterday . - I threw him out . - Threw him out ? You threw him in ... the river . And I jumped in after him at the risk of me own life . I don 't know what he may have got into afterwards , but he left here on his own legs . If you wish , you may ask my butler . He saw him go . Oh , you 've got a witness . Well , that alters the case entirely . I was misled . Grossly misled . Good afternoon , gentlemen . I wash my hands of the whole affair . You and Pontius Pilate . Well , do you wish to prosecute ? Yes , I think ... No , SirJasper . Please . Now look . There 's something wrong here . I 'm an honest man . I was inveigled in this by this bloke Feeny . And Griffin , I never saw him before in me life till last night . Herbert , you better stick to your shoe-mending . And tell your pal Griffin to get out of my jurisdiction . Yes , sir . He gets right out of my house tonight . Fine . I 'll send a constable just to make sure he goes . Thank you . Good night , sir . Yes , what is it ? I 've missed my way . Can you tell me where I 'll hit the London road ? It 's a bad night to be out . I haven 't any choice . You look ill . I 'm quite fit , thanks . Are you , indeed ? It happens I 'm a doctor . Come in . Maybe I 'd better warn you . There 's a constable after me . Constable ? You are a fugitive ? - Next thing to it . - Come in just the same . I may be able to help you . A criminal needs a doctor 's care ... I 'm no criminal ! Two of your local bigwigs robbed me . Now they 're running me out of the district . Oh , that 's too bad . Picking on a stranger , huh ? A man without a friend . That 's what I am . It 's good of you to help me . Maybe we can help each other . Come this way . Oh , don 't be afraid . We 're quite alone . My neighbors give me a wide berth . That 's what I want , to be left in peace . Only to be left in peace until ... Quiet , Snapper . Pioneers have always had to contend with fools . Look at Galileo . Look at Pasteur . Huh ? Who believed Curie , except his wife ? What about Ehrlich ? Mind the stairs here . The steps are uneven . Peel off your coat . Make yourself at home . I could do with a spot of whiskey . Right . I don 't entertain often . But the day will come when the greatest scientists of Europe will knock at my door . Then you 'll be proud to say you once had supper with the great Dr. Drury . There you are . Sit down , help yourself . Thanks . Well , happy days ! Well , happy days ! - What was that ? - Methuselah , my old parrot . Beautiful plumage , hasn 't he ? Hello ! Hello ! Yes , beautiful . I , uh , I suppose you think I 'm mad , don 't you ? No , no . Quiet , Brutus . I 'm not a crank , you know , nor a quack . Look at my degrees there on the wall . Aberdeen , Berlin , Vienna . Coming , Brutus , coming . Come on , boy . Steady . I 'll just chain you up to be sure . Come on , boy . I might have been a fashionable physician , yes , with my brougham and my titled patients , but there was something bigger . Do you want it ? Speak for it . That 's the boy . Nicely now . Don 't snatch . In the name of ... What 's the matter ? Can 't I feed my dog ? Or don 't you think there is a dog ? Why , why , yes , of course . Only ... Only you doubt it , huh ? Very well . Put out your hand , feel it . Quiet , Brutus . But there is a dog . A huge one . L - I could feel it . Of course , of course . And specially trained as my bodyguard . He 'd probably kill anyone that raised a hand to me . But the dog 's invisible . That 's impossible . In this house , you 've got to believe what you can 't see . Come on , boy . Come on . Lie down . What a breeze ! What a breeze ! Sails down . Sails down . What a breeze ! What a breeze ! It 's ... It 's incredible . Not at all , if you grasp the theory . Tell me . Have you ever studied optical density ? Molecular physics ? No . No ? That 's too bad . See here , in simple terms ... You 're an intelligent man . A body either absorbs light or it reflects it or it refracts it . If it does none of these things , if its refractive index is sufficiently lowered , it cannot of itself be visible . Can you grasp that ? Well , I ... Well , let 's look at it this way . The air you breathe ... It has body , hasn 't it ? And yet , you can 't see it . Or clear water in a glass bottle . Haven 't you ever been fooled and thought it empty ? Well , why , yes . Well , then it 's not so strange , is it ? The problem was to find a formula , a geometric expression involving four dimensions ... for use on tissue . Bone , blood . I found it . But how , how did you first ... I began working with small animals ... mice , rabbits , guinea pigs . Brutus here is the biggest subject I 've worked on ... so far . And it ... it doesn 't hurt ? It hasn 't hurt him . He 's well and happy . Whereas , before , it was a tough life , wasn 't it , old boy ? A big mongrel . Nobody 's cur . The well-bred dogs of the gentry picked on him . They would . He hadn 't a chance when they came in couples . They all hunt in couples , the gentry . But when I made him invisible , then it was his turn . Wasn 't it , old boy ? Had them at his mercy , didn 't he ? Oh , quite . Made them wish they 'd never been born . Now , if a man were invisible , he 'd be hard to find . You couldn 't make a man invisible . You 're just talking . You 're boasting ! You couldn 't . Oh , couldn 't I ? If he had the courage , if he weren 't a weakling . A neurotic with a persecution complex . Who hasn 't got the courage ? I warned you fairly . I 've never tried this on a human being . Get on with it . I 've got nothing to lose . Oh , if you could just make me like that dog . I think I can . And if I can 't ... They 'll have you up for malpractice , is that it ? No . Murder . Are you ready ? Go ahead . Will it take long ? I can 't be sure . Will I lose consciousness ? For a while . Stopped raining , hasn 't it ? Yes . Look here . I don 't feel any different . Wait . What is it ? Oh , I was just thinkin ' , what a cat-and-mouse game . Enemy they can 't see . C - Can 't get a ... get ahold of . A man ! An invisible man ! The pulse is still strong . Why , I 've outstripped the immortals of science . Archimedes , Copernicus , Faraday , Darwin . Now I am immortal . Look , here . How long is this going to take ? I can 't lie here all night . Wait a minute . I think perhaps a swallow of brandy . Here . Drink this . Now lie still . I want to make some notes while this experiment is still fresh in my mind . Why , my hand , i-it 's gone . It worked . Dr. Drury ! Why didn 't you tell me ? Is there any danger of my turning visible again ? Ha ! Not till you 're dead . And I 've got a good long while before that , and a lot to do . Yes , there is a lot to do . Now you 'd better lie down and get some sleep . And don 't worry ? Me , worry ? Others will do the worrying . Tomorrow I 'll plan my campaign . I must inform the papers . There 'll be interviews and pictures . I 'll be invited to address the Royal Societies . Run along and get some rest . - What are you doing ? - I 'm leaving . I 'm no human guinea pig to make you famous . I 've got my own plans . Why , you can 't do that ! You can 't go now ! You thought you got rid of me , Jasper , but I 've come back . Who 's that ? It 's me , Jasper . Your old friend Bob Griffin . Don 't you remember ? What is this ? Where are you ? You can 't see me , Jasper . I know . I know , you 're outside . But you 're hiding somewhere . Cold , Jasper . Still cold . But you 're in this room , Griffin ! And I 'll find you ! Yes , Jasper . I am in the room . I 'm over here . But you can 't find me , Jasper . I can see you , but you can 't see me . Oh , I could brain you if I wanted to . Now you 're at my mercy . I could strangle you . No ! See how easy it is . He-Help ! Help ! What is it you want , Griffin ? I 'll tell you what I want . I want everything you 've got . I want your money . I want your house . And I 'm going to takeJulie . Sit down , Jasper . Sit down and write what I tell you ! I 've already killed three men with a knife like this , and I wouldn 't mind making it four . Now sit down and write ! I , Jasper Herrick , of my own free will , do hereby confess ... that I twice tried to murder my good friend , Robert Griffin ... You 're mad , Griffin ! That 's a lie , and you know it . Shut up and write ! In order to rob him of that certain property ... known as Herrick Mines Limited , situated in the Tanganyika Territory near Mongaburra . In , uh , in partial expiation of my crime , I hereby assign all of my property ... to said Robert Griffin , including the estates known as Shortlands . No , no , I ... I won 't do that ! Oh , yes , Jasper . Or would you rather have your throat cut ? That 's it . Now sign it . Now give it to me . I don 't trust you , Jasper . But I 've got you right where I want you . From now on , you 'll do exactly as I say . " ... Griffin ... ... certain property ... known as Herrick Mines Limited , situated ... " Hey , no , you don 't ! Up to your old tricks , eh , Jasper ? I 'll take that chair . For heaven 's sake , Jasper , what is it ? He 's here , Irene ! Who ? Griffin ! He 's here in this room ! Yes , yes , dear , but if you 'll just lie down . I know , you think I 'm ... No , no , of course not . You 're just upset . Jasper , what ... Why , you mustn 't write things like this ever ! No , no , no , don 't tear it ! Jasper , let go . Let me go . He 's mad , I tell you , Irene . He 'll kill you ! Who ? Griffin . He 's here in this room ! He 's invisible . Oh , Jasper , stop it ! I 'm ashamed of you . Get hold of yourself . There 's no such thing as an invisible man . That 's where you 're wrong . Now I 'll take this . Oh , dear . Oh , love should be Hello , who 's there ? Let me in ! This is a nice time of the morning to come knocking on me door . Must be barmy . Say , what do you think ... Get outta my way ! Say , who do you think you are , shoving ' me around my own house ? I 'm Bob Griffin . Shut the door . Griffin ? Oh , I say , what 's happened ? What 's happened ? Have you been scalded , or have you got the mange ? Neither . I 'm invisible . You ... Oh , don 't make me laugh ! Next thing you 'll be telling me you curl up and sleep in a buttercup . Ah ! You 're as solid as I am . You don 't believe me , eh ? No ! Come here . What ? Have a look . Oh , blimey ! Oh , it 's the truth ! I had to put these wrappings on . I was causing too much excitement , wandering around without any head . I 'll have to stay with you . You 're the only man I can trust . Where do you think you 're going ? Oh , I 'm not going out . I 'm just , uh , locking the door so nobody can come in . Hurry up and get me some breakfast . I 'm hungry . Yes . Right away . I 'm very sorry , but I have nothing but a very old moldy pancake to offer you . Look , eh , why don 't you go down to the inn ? They have a very nice breakfast down there . Two kinds of jam and a bit of fish . Hurry up with the pancakes . Pancake , eh ? Right-o , pancake . Well , this flour here is a bit wormy . Do you mind ? No . Oh . All right , here we go . Pancake , huh ? Uh ... Oh , I say , look ' ere . Tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk ! There 's been a mouse in it . Sounds as if you don 't want to serve me . Oh , not at all ! I 'm very happy to do it . Very happy ! Here . Could you ... W - Would you mind puttin ' this bag over your head ? I 'm afraid you 're gonna catch cold . Here . See here ! Maybe this 'll convince you I have a head . When I put something on it , you can see it . Now watch . - How 's that ? - Blimey ! Y - Y-You 're the dead spit of yourself ! All right , now stop your chattering and get my breakfast . Yes , sir , right away . And , eh ... Er , oh , uh ... You know , I 'm very happy to have you here , but , I 'm sorry to tell you , you can 't stay . - Why not ? - Well , I 'll tell ya . This time tomorrow , I 'll have no roof over me head . I 'm losin ' this place for the want of me rent . - I 'll get you the rent . - Oh , I don 't want you to bother about it . I 'll get you more than the rent . I 'll get you money , power , the chance to hurt people the way they 've hurt you . Just you wait till tonight . You 'd be laughing through to the other side of your whiskers , Tom Meadow , if you 'd seen what I seen . And what might that be , Jem Yarrow ? I seen him myself last night on the road . A suit of clothes walking , and a hat . And he hadn 't got no head nor hands . I 'm sorry . I thought you came in ahead of me . Well , I didn 't . There you are . I wish you wouldn 't move around so much . I can 't tell where you are . Lead the way , will you ? Then I can 't trip . Thank you . Hello , Herbert . Hello , Will . Hey , Herbert . Here . Huh ? Yes ?

Accidents will happen . I didn 't even touch it . Oh , you must have . There . Think nothing of it . I wish I was home . Mr. Foster . Yes , Gray ? Excuse me , sir . Miss Julie says there won 't be an answer . All right . Thank you , sir . She 's not for you , Foster . Who said that ? Not me , not me . I said nothing . That 's funny . I must be hearing things . It 's getting so I 'm believing my own stories . Well , cheerio . Good night , all . Good night . That does it . Two half-and-halfs and a pint of bitters . There you are , Neddy .

How tiresome of me . I 'm all right now . I must get back to Mother . Now , Miss Julie , you 've had no rest , and you haven 't had a mouthful to eat since breakfast . Oh , don 't be such an old fusspot , Cleghorn . Julie , why can 't the nurses ... No , they can 't . She doesn 't feel safe unless I 'm there . Safe from what , dear ? I don 't know . She lies there babbling about invisible men ... and ... and griffins . Griffins ? Yes . It 's all part of her delirium . Griffins . Tell me , Julie . Did you ever know a man by the name of Griffin ? Not me , but ... Mother and Dad did . But he 's dead . Miss Herrick , please ! - Yes , nurse ? Does she want me ? - We can 't quieten her . You should have called me . Wait , Julie , I ... I 'll talk to you later , Mark . But , Julie . Mr. Foster ? Mr. Foster , it 's on my mind . SirJasper told me not to talk . But seeing how you and Miss Julie ... What is it , Cleghorn ? A man named Griffin was here two days ago . Are you all right ? Quite . But it was closer than I like ' em . What was that ? Keep quiet . Get back in the library . What is it now ? What do you want ? Get rid of Mark Foster . Pack him off . I won 't have him nearJulie . But it 's no use , Rob . She 's in love with him . Doesn 't she love you ? I can ruin you , remember ? Disgrace you . Go ahead , then . Do what you want to me . How could Julie marry you ? Why , you 're inhuman ! She 's for me , I tell you . For me . I 'll kill Foster before I 'll let him have her . But you 're ... you 're horrible . No woman ... You mean because I 'm invisible ? Yes , yes , that 's it . If I weren 't invisible , you 'd do your best for me , wouldn 't you ? Wouldn 't you ? Yes . Yes , of course I would . Then I 'll be visible again . I 'll be back , Jasper , to hold you to your promise . Lie still , Brutus . I wouldn 't hurt you , you old fool . You know I wouldn 't hurt you . Steady , boy . That 's a good dog . A very good dog . That 's a boy . Just as good as new , aren 't you ? Hmm ? Feel pretty good , do you ? There we go . One more and that 's all . Didn 't hurt a bit , did it ? Huh ? Didn 't hurt at all . I told you it wouldn 't . Up you go . Well , you 're just as good as you ever were , aren 't you ? Down you go . Out you go . Come on , boy . Come here . Been a pretty good dog , haven 't you ? Helped your old master a lot . We did a goodjob together . No one will know anything ever happened to you . So you 've come back . Yes , I 've come back . I knew you would . I knew you 'd have to . You 're going to make me visible again . No , that 's not possible . Don 't lie to me . I saw you make that dog visible . That was a transfusion from another dog . Every drop of his blood . Well ? The dog I took it from died . What of it ? Don 't you see ? To make you visible , I 'd have to drain the blood of a man . What of it ? That would be murder . Who cares ? Look here , Griffin . You might not stay visible . It wouldn 't last . A day , an hour . You 'd probably fade again . You 're lying ! It 's the truth . Down , Brutus . Leave that dog alone ! Don 't try any tricks . We 're going to make that blood transfusion tonight . I know the very man , nosy young fool of a reporter . Mark Foster 's his name , at the Birchester Inn . Call him and tell him you 've got the invisible man here . He 'll come like a shot . Go on . Call him up ! Go on . Do it ! I won 't do it . I 'm a scientist , not a murderer . Would you rather I took your blood ? I 'll call him . Operator ... get me 117 . Make it sound convincing . Are you there ? I would like to speak with Mr. Mark Foster . Here , hold on , hold on . What 's all this about ? Oh , hello , Foster . This is Dr. Drury speaking ... from the old stone house in Thrustlewood . Listen carefully . I 've got the invisible man . It 's a matter of life and death . Invisible man , me eye . Whose life is he threatening now , may I ask ? Mine , if he should break loose . I 've got him right here , caught . Yes , Dr. Drury . Come at once . All right , sir . We 'll be over presently . He 's coming . Good . I 'll have a spot of whiskey . I 'll take it . - Yes ? - Is this Dr. Drury ? - Yes , this is Dr. Drury . - Birchester Police calling . Just checking on a call that just came in from you . Never mind it . No . No , I didn 't call . Oh , you didn 't , eh ? You asked for it , Drury . I 'll have to take your blood . Good evening , Sergeant . How are you , Constable ? Good evening , sir . What can we do for you ? There 's no hurry . Take your time . We won 't be but a moment , sir . Do you mind if I watch ? Not at all . Make yourself right at home , sir . Six . Fifteen for two . Ahh . That does it . Well , sir , what can we do for you ? I just dropped in to see if you picked up any more yarns about the invisible man . Chap just called in , said he 'd caught the invisible man , he did . Caught the inv ... That 's what he said . He was making game of us , he was . But he asked for you . Did you check the call ? Yes . An old quack doctor out Thrustlewood way . Drury was his name . A quack in the head , he is . Makes all manner of unholy experiments . Experiments , did you say ? Huh ? Come on , Constable . We 're going out there . Look . Can 't you make this thing go any faster ? I 'm exceeding the speed limit now . You lied to me , Drury . I 'm as good as ever . See ? I 'm going to stay this way as long as there 's blood to be had . Right around the next turn . Rob . Rob Griffin . My name is Field , understand ? You 've been expecting me . I 've come to make you a nice , long visit . But you 've become ... Yes , as you advised . I 'm visible again . I 'm sorry , SirJasper , but I 'd retired as you suggested . That 's all right , Cleghorn . You look as if you think you know me . Well , I-I ... Set him right , Jasper ! This is Mr. Field , Cleghorn . Mr. Field ? Martin Field . And I expect to be here for quite some time . I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking how easy it would be to turn me in . Don 't try it , Jasper . I can make myself invisible whenever I please . Look here , I never meant ... I didn 't dream ... I came here to take possession . Now give me your keys . Keys ? Yes . That 's it . I 'll go and come at will . I 'm visible again , and I 've come back forJulie . Rob . Rob , for pity 's sake , you ... And nothing can stop me . Come in . - Hello , Rob . - Shut the door . Ah , yes . Well , it is a pleasure to see you . And to be able to see you , that 's the nice thing about it . How did you know I was here ? I heard Alf Prouty talking about the bloke he sent down here last night . It was right after the Drury fire , you know . So I said to myself , " Oh , that must be me friend Rob Griffin come back to life . " The name is Field . Martin Field . Well , whatever it is . Well , I am pleased to see you 're living in a nice home like this , eh ? What , oh ! Ooh ! How do you do ? Say , you know , we ought to be as cozy as a couple of bugs in a rug ... now that our troubles are over . Our trouble ? Mmm . Where do you come in ? Oh , Rob . I stuck by you when you were poor . You don 't think I 'm going to desert you , now you 're rich . I 'll give you 50 pounds and get out , understand ? Fifty pounds ? Oh , what a shock . And coming right on top of poor Dr. Drury ... being killed by an unknown hand . Well , unknown by most . Put two and two together , have you ? Yes . Would you like to know why Drury had to die ? Yes . I needed his blood to make me visible again . Oh , no ! But it won 't last , Herbert . I 'm going to need more . Oh , yes ? Who can we get ? I know ! Look ... Hey ! Here , don 't look at me like that now . I 'm too small . I ain 't got enough red " corpuskles " ... in my blood to bait a mousetrap . Well , what 's the matter ? What are you doing ? It 's Drury 's dog . Well , all right . So what ? Hey , you 're trembling like a leaf , you know . He 's the only living thing I 'm afraid of . Afraid ? You afraid ? Oh , what an horrid thought . Look at me , I ain 't afraid . That dog ? Why , I 'd take him by the tail , pull it out and hit him over the head with it . You would ? Yes . Why , I 'd strangle him with me bare hands . Then do it , strangle him , poison him , anything . I 'll give you 500 pounds . Oh , 500 pounds for a big job like that ? Oh , Rob ! I 'll give you a thousand if you kill him . A thousand . Come here . Come here . Oh . Yes ? Huh ? Take my coat . Let him smell it . He 'll follow you anywhere . Don 't worry . I 'll follow him . The job is done . Uh , you mean you want it done now ? Certainly I want it done now . Mark , how dreadful ! And you say the house was completely burned to the ground ? Completely . There wasn 't even a piece of glass to get fingerprints from . You mean , there weren 't any clues ? Not one , SirJasper . The murderer just sort of melted away . Mark , stop being so literary . What do you mean just " melted away " ? Just that . I think the murderer was invisible . Invisible ? Who 's invisible ? Hello . Hello , Julie . Hello , Field . Will you have some lunch ? Yes , do . You hardly touched your breakfast . Mark , this is my old friend Martin Field . Mark Foster of the Courier . Oh , yes . You 're the chap who writes those , uh ... spook stories , aren 't you ? If you want to call them that , yes . It 's a good line . People love that sort of fantasy . - It 's not fantasy . It 's true . - Oh , come now , Mark . I mean it . I 've seen the invisible man . Oh , Mark , how could you possibly see the invisible man ? I saw him , I heard him ... Stick to your guns . That 's the spirit . Will you take wine or beer , sir ? Beer , Cleghorn . Still , the idea offers some practical difficulties , doesn 't it ? I mean , well , what would the invisible man eat ? Surely not filet of sole . Spider webs , more likely . Charming notion . Yes , isn 't it ? Oh , and what would he drink ? Dew drops ? Surely not beer . I think he drinks blood . Mark . - What makes you say that ? - Because Dr. Drury 's body ... was drained of every last drop of blood . - How awful ! - If you 'll excuse me . Sounds a bit like Dracula , doesn 't it ? I mean , that sort of thing is out of date . A transfusion would be more to the point . What for ? Perhaps to become visible again . Say , that 's an idea . But why should he want to be visible ? Read your mythology , Miss Julie . Even the gods want love . And ... And your invisible man , let 's say he has a need to enjoy what other men enjoy . You know , you 're better at this sort of thing than I am . And then , the day of days , he finds out how to do it . Blood . Human blood . That 's deliberate murder . Why not ? What man who is truly great would stop at that ? And there he is ... visible again . He has only to reach out and take what he wants . But will he stay visible ? It 's a joke on him if he found himself fading out , I mean , at some crucial moment . There 's always plenty of blood . He can be visible or invisible . Think of the power , the authority , the finality of his slightest wish . Why ... Why , a man like that could rock the world . A knife slipped . L-I cut my hand . Let me get you something . No , thanks . L - I 'll dress it . He 's quite pale . Oh ! You gave me quite a start . Indeed , you did . - Oh , Norma . - Yes , sir ? Ask Mr. Foster to come up at once , please . Yes , Mr. Field . It 's a purely personal matter . Speak to him when you 're alone , will you ? Yes , indeed , sir . Oh , Mr. Foster . Mr. Field would like to see you in his room . Thank you , Norma . Hello , Field . Are you here ? Hello , Field ? Hey , Field , are you down here ? I told you you 'd find the invisible man down here . You can 't get away , Foster . You 're locked in , and we 're all alone where nobody can hear us . You want the lights out , eh ? So I can 't see you . Well , it won 't work . Hey , that wasn 't even close . You haven 't a chance , Foster . It would be easy to kill you , But I 've got to have your blood . The joke 's on you , Foster . Your blood will make me visible , and I 'll marryJulie while ... while you rot in your grave . It 's no use , Foster . I 'm still here . Give me that . I 'm closing in on you , Foster . You haven 't got a chance . You don 't know where I am . You can 't fight what you can 't see . I might be in back of you . I might be at your side . Or I might be in front of you ! Up you come now . That 's it . Just the way I want you . There you are . It won 't take long , and you 'll never feel a thing . Come on , give it here . Come on here with me . Come ' ere ! Come ' ere ! Hello , Travers . What brings you here ? Listen , Herrick . Alf Prouty here tells me he picked up a man last night near the scene of the murder . Aye , and I set him right down slap here at this door . Is that the truth , Herrick ? Why , yes . You ... You see , an old friend of mine ... Herrick , we shall have to see him . Of course . Certainly . Oh , Cleghorn , will you ask Mr. Field to come in here ... What were you doing with Dr. Drury 's dog ? Nothing . Nothing . What do you mean nothing ? Mr. Griffin , he was afraid of him . Griffin ? I mean , Mr. Field . Yes , but Mr. Field is not in his room . What ? He 's not ? Come on , let 's open this door . He must be inside . Well , come on , then . Let 's break it down . We have nothing more to fear from the invisible man . He 's dead . And judgment was passed on him ... by a higher court than ours . He 's taken Foster 's blood the same as he did Drury 's . But he 's still alive . Come on , get him out of here . Come on , Foster . And then ? Well , sir , he says to me , " I 'll make you as rich as Gresis . " But , oh , did that tempt me ? Yes , it did . Oh , no , sir , no , Sir Frederick . I was then and I am now unsullied . May I go now , sir ? No , wait a moment . I wonder how he learned to become invisible . From that old crank Dr. Drury , of course . Their secret died with them luckily . A couple oflunatics . That 's right , sir . Griffin was always talking about getting back at people . Never entered his head the dog would have the same idea towards him . I mean , on account of what happened to old man Drury . From what Father said , his mind was , well , warped . It must have been . Warped by imaginary wrongs . A man fighting shadows . He 's to be pitied , really . He probed too deeply in forbidden places . What a man earns , he gets . Nature has a strange way of paying him back ... in his own coin .

 There 's a curse upon this village , the curse of Frankenstein . Aye . [ Man ] Aye , it is true . The whole countryside shuns the village . Our fields are barren , the inn is empty . My little ones cry in their sleep . They are hungry . There is no bread . It 's the curse , the curse of Frankenstein . This is nonsense , folks ! You talk as though these were the Dark Ages . You know as well as I ... that the monster died in the sulphur pit under Frankenstein 's tower . And that Ygor , his familiar , was riddled with bullets from the gun of Baron Frankenstein himself . Ygor does not die that easily . They hanged him and broke his neck , but he lives ! [ Man ] Haven 't I seen him , sitting beside the hardened sulphur pit , playing his weird horn as if to lure the monster ... back from death to do his evil bidding . [ Angry Shouting ] You talk like frightened children . Well , if something isn 't done , there 'll be a new mayor after the fall election . Aye ! Aye ! Well , what do you want me to do ? Destroy the castle ! Wipe the last traces of these accursed Frankensteins from our land . - The people are right . - I agree , Your Honor . [ Angry Shouting ] I don 't believe that these dead wretches ... can affect the prosperity of this village . But do as you will with the castle . It 's yours . We 'll blow it up ! [ Shouting ] [ Gasping ] Look ! Old Ygor ! [ Man ] I told you he was alive . All the more reason to blow up the castle . You fiend ! You swine ! My friend ! They didn 't kill you ! You lived through the pit , the sulphur pit ! The sulphur was good for you , wasn 't it ? It preserved you ! [ Wicked Chuckle ] We have to hurry . We have to hurry . Come . I help you , my friend . Come , my friend . Now you live forever . They can 't destroy you . Come . We go away . We have to hurry . They dynamite ... the castle . [ Shouting ] They 're too late . We fooled them . Come . We go to the country . A better country than this . [ Thunderclap ] No ! No ! Come back ! Come back ! No . No ! No ! [ Thunderclap ] The lightning . It is good for you . Your father was Frankenstein . But your mother was the lightning ! She has come down to you again . We will go to Ludwig , the second son of Frankenstein . He has all the secrets of his father who created you . We will force him to harness the lightning for you . It will give you strength , strength of a hundred men . Come ! Come ! We are going to find Dr. Frankenstein . There you are , gentlemen . The usual post-surgical treatment . Think of it . The first time the human brain has been removed from the skull , subjected to surgery and then replaced . With success ... we hope . Dr. Frankenstein , we have to remember ... the patient was violently dementia praecox . Medical science has advanced since you made your experiment , Dr. Bohmer . It 's unfortunate that it had such ... tragic consequences . But you blazed the trail . It was you who pointed the way . If you should want me , I shall be in my library completing my notes . How 's the patient , Dr. Kettering ? All indications excellent . Respiration , pulse , everything . Wonderful , wasn 't it ? Oh , yes . [ Chuckling ] Wonderful ! A bit belated , perhaps , but wonderful nevertheless . [ Dr. Kettering ] Why live always in the past , Dr. Bohmer ? You 've allowed that one mistake of yours to embitter your whole life . Mistake ? Oh , no , no , no . Just a slight miscalculation , that 's all . But my experiment was a success . In those days , I was the master . Frankenstein was just the pupil . But ... I made a slight miscalculation . [ Honking ] Please , what is the name of this village ? Vasaria . Pretty place . [ Ygor ] Is there a doctor named Frankenstein ? Ludwig Frankenstein in the village ? You mean the one who heals those sick in mind ? Yes ! Yes ! That 's the one I mean . Do you know the doctor ? Very well . I know his father and his brother too . He lives in a chateau at the end of the village . A large house with a high wall . Oh , yes . Thank you . I 'll show her how to boot it . Look at your ball up there . How do you like that ? All the way to the roof . Hello . Are you a giant ? Can you get my ball ? [ Girl ] Way up there . Isn 't that your child , Hussman ? Yes ! Yes ! No . No ! Don 't do that ! Do you want to kill my child ? [ Crowd Screaming ] Cloestine , ask your friend to bring you down , dear ! Ask your friend to bring you down . Please take me down to Daddy . Tell him no one will hurt him . Take me down . My daddy says no one will hurt you . [ Scream ] Get him ! No ! You promised not to hurt him . Where are you going , Erik ? Hello , Elsa . I didn 't see you . What are you doing driving around the countryside in the middle of the day ? Town prosecutor should be in his office . Sometimes my work takes me out of my office . I came to see your father . Mmm , that 's pretty . I flattered myself that you came to take me for a drive . I wish . Nothing could make me happier . But this is serious . I must see your father . Since you put it that way , I 'll have to find him . [ Knocking ] Come in . Father , you have a visitor . And a very welcome one too . Delighted to see you . How are you ? You look worried . Elsa treating you badly ? No , not at all . Be patient . Wait till you 're married . Doctor , we have a madman in jail . I 'd like you to examine him and advise us . I have some work , but I 'll come later . This is urgent . He 's killed two villagers . We have him chained , but if he breaks loose he can tear down the building . That 's ... rather an exaggeration , isn 't it ? No , indeed , sir . He 's huge , a monster . I 've never seen anything like him . Very well , Erik . As soon as I finish , I 'll come down . Thank you , sir . I 'll be expecting you . [ Knocking ] Come ! There 's a man in the waiting room to see you , Doctor . He says it 's very urgent . He comes from the village of Frankenstein . Very well , I 'll see him . Martha , I 'd rather my daughter didn 't know about this visitor . Certainly , sir . How does it feel to face a man you thought your brother killed ? What do you want ? The monster is with me . He 's the one in the police station , but he won 't be there long . You will bring him here . - The law must take its course . - What can the law do to him ? You think they can keep him in jail ? He is more dangerous today than he ever was before . Besides his sick brain , he has a sick body . You can make him well , Frankenstein . How ? What can I do ? You can harness the lightning as your father did . Pour life into his hungry veins . Give him back the strength he once had . Will you do it , Frankenstein ? Ever since the day my father put life into that creature , it has been a curse . The terrible consequences of his creation killed my father ... and drove my brother into exile . The monster shall not ruin my life ! I 'm happy here . I have a lovely daughter , friends . They know nothing of all this . You wouldn 't like to spoil that , would you ? You wouldn 't want me to tell them ... that you are the son of Frankenstein that created him . That your brother made the thing live ... after it had been dead for years ! Do you want me to tell them , Frankenstein ? No ! No . [ Chuckle ] All right . Then you 'll make the police to hand him over to you . Yes . I could do that . And you will do it , Frankenstein . Very well . Now get out ! Father , who was that strange man I saw leaving the house ? Oh , nobody of any consequence , darling . A patient . He smiled at me , a cruel smile . It was dreadful . Well , you know what my patients are . Don 't let it worry you . Come along , my dear . I must be getting down to the village . Order ! Order , please ! I 've read the report on the nameless prisoner . I don 't understand the urgency that requires an immediate hearing . This is an unusual case . The prisoner 's dangerous . [ Erik ] It 'd be wise to transfer him to the city immediately . I understand the man is insane . There 's no doubt of it . [ Erik ] That 's for the higher court to determine . We should make a report on the prisoner 's mental condition . Dr. Frankenstein will be here shortly to examine him . Very well . [ Pounding ] The prosecutor may proceed . What is your name ? Where are you from ? Who brought you to Vasaria ? You see , Your Honor , this mad beast cannot even talk . I recommend that you order him remanded to the higher court without further delay . I understand the Hussman girl has an influence over the prisoner . [ Judge ] Perhaps if she talked to him , we might learn his identity . Your Honor , I protest ! We 've had one harrowing ... He did her no harm . Some attempt must be made ... to establish his identity . I can 't allow my child to take this chance . We don 't know what he might do . He was promised he 'd not be harmed , and he 's been beaten half to death . What 's your name ? Where do you live ? Won 't you tell us ? All this can serve no purpose , Your Honor . Dr. Frankenstein is here . Let him examine the prisoner now . He seems to recognize you , Dr. Frankenstein . I never saw this ... man before in my life . I know nothing about him . [ Screaming ] Come ! Come . Come . Quickly ! Quickly . Get in here ! [ Thunderclap ] [ Screaming ] Oh , oh , Father ! The monster , it 's here . I 've seen it . Nonsense . He was standing outside the window . Your nerves are on edge . No , no , it 's here , I tell you . That other creature was with him . That Ygor . Frankenstein . Frankenstein ! Frankenstein . [ Screaming ] No , no ! No , no , no . Come away . Come away with me . Nobody will know who did it . Come . Come . Come with me . Father , who is it ? Dr. Kettering . Elsa , go back , go back ! [ Screaming ] Come away . [ Ygor ] Come with me . Come ! Bohmer ? Dr. Bohmer ! What is it , Doctor ? Give me a hand . Father ? The monster ? Don 't be afraid , darling . You 're quite safe . He 's powerless for the time being . Forgive me , Elsa , but I had to expose you to the soporific gas to subdue the others . You do understand , don 't you , dear ? Yes , but ... I 'm afraid . Send for Erik and the police . The police can do nothing . They put him in jail yesterday , but he escaped . And ... Dr. Kettering ? I tried to save him , but it was impossible . He 's dead . Murdered . Yes . Ever since I can remember , I have dreaded this moment . For years I felt secure , certain that the monster had been destroyed . I tried to keep all knowledge of it from you . And until last night , I succeeded . I had to know . Yesterday when I saw Ygor , I felt that something had come out of the past to threaten our happiness . Please don 't let it spoil our lives ! Father , promise me . I promise you , Elsa . I 'll find a way . I must find a way ! Dr. Bohmer , I need your aid . This monster must be destroyed . Destroyed ? But how ? He 's not subject to the ordinary laws of life . There is a way . It was made limb by limb , organ by organ . He must be unmade in the same way . Dissection ? Bit by bit , piece by piece , just as my father created it . But ... this thing lives . It would be murder . How can you call the removal of a thing that is not human murder ? I regret , Doctor , I cannot be part of your plan . Then I must do it alone . While it lives , no one is safe . [ Man ] My son ! What are you about to do ? Would you destroy ... that which I , your father , dedicated his life to creating ? I must . The monster you created is in itself destruction . Nevertheless , I was near to solving a problem ... that has baffled man since the beginning of time , the secret oflife , artificially created . But it has brought death to everything it has touched . That is because unknowingly I gave it a criminal brain . With your knowledge of science you can cure that . It 's beyond my cure . It 's a malignant brain . What if it had another brain ? Another brain ! Bohmer ! Dr. Bohmer ! [ Electricity Crackling ] What is it , Doctor ? You 've changed your mind ? Yes , yes . Attach the high-frequency leads to the terminal electrodes . [ Dr. Bohmer ] Yes , sir . Frankenstein ! Come in , Ygor . I may need your assistance . You have agreed . You are going to help him ? You are giving him life . Yes , but not for the purpose that you think , Ygor . I 'm giving him strength so an operation may be successful . [ Ygor ] An operation ? [ Frankenstein ] Yes , I 'm giving him another brain . You must explain to him when he becomes conscious . You must make him understand . Whose brain ? Kettering ? Yes , Kettering . [ Frankenstein ] A man of character and learning . The monster will cease to be an evil influence and become everything good . No ! No , no ! You cannot take my friend away from me . He 's all that I have , nothing else . You 're going to make him your friend , and I will be alone . It will be as I say or he must be destroyed . Ha-ha ! He cannot be destroyed . There is one way . By dissection . [ Ygor ] No ! Not that ! Doctor ! Ygor 's body 's no good . His neck is broken , crippled and distorted , lame and sick from the bullets your brother fired into me . [ Ygor ] You can put my brain in his body . Your brain ? You can make us one . We 'll be together always , my brain and his body ... [ Ygor ] Together . You 're a cunning fellow , Ygor . Do you think that I 'd put your sly and sinister brain into the body of a giant ? Huh ! That would be a monster indeed ! You 'll do as I tell you , or I 'll not be responsible for the consequences . Ironic , isn 't it ? Yes , the monster 's victim shall inherit his body . And everlasting life . Build up the voltage potential to its maximum . It all seems so weird and ghastly . I can 't stand it any longer , I tell you . Elsa ! And you , Father , something 's happened to you . It seems as if a great cloud had come over you . You don 't seem like my father at all . You must trust me , my dear . You must realize my problem ! One thing I can assure you , the monster will never trouble anyone again . [ Knocking ] Good morning . I was wondering , Doctor , when you plan to ... operate . At once . Tonight , if possible . I should like to see the patient immediately . Yes , Doctor . A new brain , you understand ? A new brain . New brain ! [ Chuckling ] Does he understand ? Oh , yes . Is he willing ? Can 't you see ? He is the first time happy in his life . Good . Take good care of him today . I shall operate tonight . All right . No ! Not now Tonight . So you 're going to let Frankenstein do this operation ... to put the brain of his friend into our friend . Our friend ? Yeah , you , the great Dr. Bohmer , who taught Frankenstein everything he knows . [ Chuckling ] How would you like to be the leader of your profession in this state ? The head of the medical commission ? The regent of the university ? You weave a pretty fairy tale , crooked neck . How could that be accomplished ? You will see to it ... that the brain of Kettering does not go into the head of the monster . - But why ? - My brain will go into it . [ Chuckling ] You fool , you 'd die . Die ... I will live again . Only this crooked body will die . I will live forever . My brain in that body ... would make me a leader of men . We would rule the state ... and even the whole country . You 'll do as I say ... and you will have everything you want . Good evening , Doctor . Good evening . Good evening , Erik . Good evening . We 're awfully sorry to disturb you . We 've called regarding the escaped maniac . Well ? The countryside 's been combed . Every barn and haystack 's been searched , and the villages have been notified . But he and his companion have disappeared completely . It seems that you 've done all that is possible . A creature like that couldn 't pass long unnoticed . Obviously someone 's offering him refuge . What are you trying to insinuate ? Perhaps you would care to search the estate . I warn you if you contemplate such presumption , you will not be welcome here as my guest . That won 't be necessary , if you 'll permit me to have a few words with Dr. Kettering . Unfortunately , Dr. Kettering had to leave suddenly ... owing to illness in his family . He was here yesterday evening . I saw him . Quite so . He left early this morning . You were at the station to watch the morning train ? Dr. Kettering was not on the morning train . I shall have to risk your displeasure . We will search the premises . Very well . This is my laboratory , gentlemen . Inspect the walls and flooring for secret passageways . Very good . Mr. Ernst ! Will you guide us , Doctor ? I believe that leads to an old dungeon . Why , certainly . What 's that room ? An auxiliary operating room ... maintained at a very low temperature . It 's not in use now . Will you lead us , Doctor ? It would seem that this room has been recently occupied . You 're familiar with my work . I keep this room ready at all times for the more violently insane . You can see that it is not occupied now . Yes , my apologies , Doctor . I warned you that you might regret this action . [ Thunderclap ] Are you mad ? Why 'd you let him get away ? Let him ? You think I had any idea what he was going to do ? Or that I could stop him ? The police have searched the place for him . Then it 's good we were gone . Frankenstein 's been half insane . He wants to operate tonight . The child complicates matters . Leave that to me . He will have to be told . Ygor will explain to him . No , no , you do not understand . It would kill her . You wouldn 't want to kill your little friend . Ygor has a better idea . You will see . You will have the brain of your friend , Ygor . Tonight my brain ... will be your brain . Tonight Ygor will die for you . [ Gasping ] [ Ygor ] Help ! [ Groaning ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Frankenstein ] Elsa ! Where are you going ? I 'm going out to find Erik . In this storm ? Yes , Father , I can 't ... Father , what does he want ? I 'm going to operate to give him a new brain . He wants the brain of that child . Take me home . Please , take me home . Father ! Surely you 're not going to ... Take the child in there quickly . How did the patient react to the anesthetic ? Surprisingly well , particularly the spinal . I can safely say everything is ready . Dr. Bohmer , our operations must be timed with the utmost precision . Any delay in the transfer will mean failure . Exactly , sir , shall I proceed ? Yes . I must warn you . This operation may not be successful . This may be the end of everything . Better death ... than a life like this , now that I have seen ... the promise of a life forever . Kettering 's brain . What will he think when he resumes life in that body ? Will he thank us for giving him a new lease on life ? Or will he object to finding his ego living in that human junk heap ? There 's no sign of returning consciousness yet , Doctor . I anticipated this . You will let me know immediately if there 's a change . Certainly , sir . Dr. Bohmer , I can never thank you sufficiently ... for your assistance and skill . This may bring you the recognition which has long been due to you . That 's very nice of you , sir . [ Man ] None of us will be safe . Who 's he gonna get next ? Fellow townsmen , it 's two weeks since my daughter disappeared . It 's the common belief that she perished when my house was burned down . But a search was made of the ashes , and no bones were found . She was stolen , stolen by the fiend who murdered Carl and Josef . [ Murmuring ] We 've searched the hills , mountains and forests . He can 't be found ! Why can 't he be found ? Why can 't the police find him ? There 's a very good reason . He 's being harbored , protected by someone . There 's only one person who would protect a maniac like that . Who ? Dr. Frankenstein . Let 's go to Frankenstein and choke the truth out of him ! [ Man ] Mr. Ernst ! Mr. Ernst ! They 're on their way to Dr. Frankenstein ! Stop ! Stop right where you are ! When did you people decide to take the law into your own hands ? When we found out we couldn 't get any help from you . Two men have been murdered , and we want the maniac that did it . My little child has been stolen . The law in Vasaria has done everything to apprehend this monster . Maybe Dr. Frankenstein can tell us where he is . [ Crowd Murmuring ] Nothing 's to be gained by hasty action . Nothing 's to be gained by waiting either ... when the prosecutor 's in love with Frankenstein 's daughter . That has nothing to do with my duty ! Let me have a few moments alone with Dr. Frankenstein . If he 's concealing this monster , he must be made to give him up . If he refuses , you can take any action you want to . Does that sound fair to you , men ? [ Knocking ] I 'd like to see Dr. Frankenstein . The doctor isn 't seeing anyone . He 'll have to see me . Erik ! What are those people doing at the gates ? They 're demanding to see your father ? What do they want ? They think he knows about the disappearance of the monster and the Hussman child . Oh , what can we do ? I 've got to see him ... before they do , or I can 't be responsible for the consequences . What is it you want ? The villagers are getting out of hand . If you expect the protection of my office , you 'll have to be frank with me . There 's certain matters which must be clarified . What do you mean ? The case of Dr. Kettering . He did not return home . He wasn 't even expected there . He did not leave Vasaria by train as you intimated . Your servants say his clothes are still in his room , which is locked by your orders . I think the time 's come for a showdown , Doctor . Perhaps you 're right . Come with me . May I have a word with you , Dr. Bohmer ? Yes , sir . It is imperative that we see the patient . What is his condition ? His recuperative powers have proved tremendous . He appears to have complete control of all his faculties . Why did you deny that you were concealing the monster ? It was necessary for a while . You see , Erik , the monster , as you know , was a homicidal maniac . He killed Dr. Kettering , but Dr. Kettering lives again . His brain is now inside the skull of the monster . I have replaced an evil brain with a good one . I have made amends for the great tragedy ... my father and brother unintentionally brought to this community . I 've restored the good name of Frankenstein . Let me show you . He 's been in there long enough . We may be losing valuable time . All right , men , he 's had his chance . Now , it 's our turn . Come on ! [ Man ] Come on ! Do you recognize me ? Tell me , who am I ? You are ... Dr. Frankenstein . [ Frankenstein ] And you are ? You are Dr. Kettering . I am not Dr. Kettering . I am Ygor . What have I done ? I am Ygor . I have the strength of 100 men . I cannot die . I cannot be destroyed . I , Ygor , will live forever ! I 've created 100 times the monster that my father made . [ Frankenstein ] Bohmer ! This is your work ! Don 't touch him , Frankenstein ! He 's my friend . I should kill you , Frankenstein . But after all , your father gave me life ... and you gave me a brain . It 's the townspeople . I can 't offer you protection now . Bohmer , turn on the gas . Fill the house with it . We 'll kill all of them . [ Yelling ] Get back , get back ! You may all be killed ! They 're turning on the gas ! [ Coughing ] Bohmer ! You must be mad ! Leave him alone . My dear ! My dear ! [ Man ] I told you it was Dr. Frankenstein . Get out of the house ! Hurry ! But what about father ! I 'll go back for him . Bohmer ! Bohmer ! I can 't see ! Bohmer ! Where are you ? Here . Here , I am ! I ... can 't see you . Your dream of power is over , Bohmer . You didn 't realize ... his blood is the same type as Kettering 's ... but not the same as Ygor 's . It will not feed the sensory nerves . Bohmer ! You played me a trick ! What good is a brain without eyes to see ? What good is a brain without eyes ?

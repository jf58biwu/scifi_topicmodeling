The whole countryside shuns the village . Our fields are barren , the inn is empty . My little ones cry in their sleep . They are hungry . There is no bread . [ TOWNSPEOPLE MUTTERING ] It 's the curse , the curse of Frankenstein . MAYOR : This is nonsense , folks . MAYOR : You talk as though these were the Dark Ages . You know as well as I do ... that the monster died in the sulphur pit under Frankenstein 's tower ... and that Ygor , his familiar ... was riddled with bullets from the gun of Baron Frankenstein himself . But Ygor does not die that easily . They hanged him and broke his neck , but he lives . Haven 't I seen him , sitting beside the hardened sulphur pit ... playing his weird horn , as if to lure the monster ... back from death to do his evil bidding . [ TOWNSPEOPLE SHOUTING AFFIRMATIVELY ] MAYOR : You talk like frightened children . Well , if something isn 't done ... there 'll be a new mayor after the fall election .

She has come down to you again . YGOR : We will go to Ludwig , the second son of Frankenstein . He has all the secrets of his father , who created you . We will force him to harness the lightning for you . It will give you strength , strength of a hundred men . YGOR : Come . We are going to find Dr. Frankenstein . [ PEACEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] There you are , gentlemen . The usual post-surgical treatment . KETTERING : Think of it . The first time the human brain has been removed from the skull ... subjected to surgery , and then replaced . With success , we hope . After all , Dr. Frankenstein , we have to remember ... the patient was violently dementia praecox . Medical science has advanced a great deal ... since you made your experiment , Dr. Bohmer . It 's unfortunate that it had such tragic consequences . But you blazed the trail . It was you who pointed the way . If you should want me , gentlemen , I shall be in my library completing my notes . - BOHMER : How 's the patient , Dr. Kettering ? - KETTERING : All indications excellent . Respiration , pulse , everything . - KETTERING : Wonderful , wasn 't it ? - BOHMER : Yes . BOHMER : Wonderful . A bit belated , perhaps , but wonderful nevertheless . KETTERING : Why live always in the past , Dr. Bohmer ? You 've allowed that one mistake of yours to embitter your whole life . Mistake ? No . Just a slight miscalculation , that 's all . But my experiment was a success . In those days ... I was the master . Frankenstein was just the pupil . But I made a slight miscalculation . [ DUCKS QUACKING LOUDLY ] Please , what is the name of this village ? - Vasaria . - Pretty place . Is there a doctor named Frankenstein ... Ludwig Frankenstein in the village ? You mean the one who heals those who are sick in mind ? YGOR : Yes . That 's the one I mean . - Do you know the doctor ? - Very well . I know his father and his brother , too .

Sometimes my work takes me out of my office . - I came to see your father . - That 's pretty . I flattered myself that you came way out here to take me for a drive . I wish that were the case , darling . Nothing could make me happier . But this is a very serious matter . I must see your father . Since you put it that way , I 'll have to find him . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Come in . - ELSA : Father , you have a visitor . - LUDWIG : And a very welcome one , too . Delighted to see you , Erik . How are you ? You look worried . Elsa been treating you badly ? No , not at all , sir . Be patient . Wait till you 're married . Doctor , we have a madman in jail . I 'd like you to examine him and advise us . Well , I have some work to do , but I 'll come later . But this is urgent . He 's already killed two villagers . We have him chained but if he breaks loose , he can tear down the building . - That 's rather an exaggeration , isn 't it ? - No , indeed , sir . He 's huge , a monster . I 've never seen anything like him . Very well , Erik . As soon as I finish my work , I 'll come down . ERIK : Thank you , sir . I 'll be expecting you . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Come . There 's a man in the waiting room to see you , Doctor . He says it 's very urgent . He comes from the village of Frankenstein . Very well , I 'll see him . Martha ... I 'd rather my daughter didn 't know about this visitor . Certainly , sir . How does it feel to face a man you thought your brother killed , Doctor ? - What do you want ? - The monster is with me . He 's the one in the police station . But he won 't be there long . You will bring him here . - The law must take its course . - Law ! What can the law do to him ? YGOR : Do you think they can keep him in jail ? YGOR : He is more dangerous today than he ever was before . Besides his sick brain , he has a sick body . You can make him well , Frankenstein . How ? What can I do ? You can harness the lightning , as your father did . Pour life into his hungry veins . YGOR : Give him back the strength he once had . Will you do it , Frankenstein ? Ever since the day my father put life into that creature , it has been a curse . The terrible consequences of his creation killed my father ... and drove my brother into exile . The monster shall not ruin my life . I 'm happy here . I have a lovely daughter , friends . They know nothing of all this . You wouldn 't like to spoil that , Doctor , would you ? You wouldn 't want me to tell them ... that you are the son of the Frankenstein that created him ... that your brother made the thing live ... after it had been dead for years . Do you want me to tell them , Frankenstein ? No . YGOR : All right . YGOR : Then you 'll make the police to hand him over to you . Yes . I could do that . And you will do it , Frankenstein . Very well . Now get out ! [ SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] [ SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC INTENSIFIES ] [ SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] Father , who was that strange man I saw leaving the house ? Nobody of any consequence , darling . A patient . He smiled at me . A cruel smile . It was dreadful . Well , you know what my patients are . Don 't let it worry you . Now come along , my dear . I must be getting down to the village . [ TOWNSPEOPLE CHATTERING ] Order ! Order , please ! I 've read the report on the nameless prisoner . I don 't understand the urgency that requires an immediate hearing . This is an unusual case , sir . The prisoner 's dangerous . It 'd be wise to remand him to the higher court ... and transfer him to the city soon . I understand the man is insane . There 's no doubt of it . But that 's for the higher court to determine . We should make a report on the prisoner 's mental condition . Dr. Frankenstein will be here shortly to examine him . Very well . The prosecutor may proceed . ERIK : What is your name ? Where are you from ? Who brought you to Vasaria ? You see , Your Honour ? This mad beast cannot even talk . I recommend that you order him remanded to the higher court without further delay . I understand the little Hussman girl has a certain influence over the prisoner . Perhaps if she talked to him , we might learn his identity . HUSSMAN : Your Honour , I protest . We 've had one harrowing experience with this ... He did her no harm . And some attempt must be made to establish his identity . I can 't allow my child to take this chance . We don 't know what he might do . He was promised he 'd not be harmed , and he 's been beaten half to death . What 's your name ? Where do you live ?

He 's dead . - Murdered ? - Yes . Ever since I can remember , I have dreaded this moment . For years I felt secure , certain that the monster had been destroyed . I tried to keep all knowledge of it from you . And until last night , I succeeded . I had to know . Yesterday , when I saw Ygor ... I felt that something had come out of the past to threaten our happiness . Please don 't let it spoil our lives . - ELSA : Father , promise me . - LUDWIG : I promise you , Elsa . I 'll find a way . I must find a way . [ SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] [ OMINOUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] [ INTENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] Dr. Bohmer , I need your aid . This monster must be destroyed . Destroyed ? But how ? He 's not subject to the ordinary laws of life . There is a way . He was made limb by limb , organ by organ . He must be unmade in the same way . Dissection ? Bit by bit , piece by piece ... just as my father created it . But this thing lives . It would be murder . How can you call the removal of a thing that is not human murder ? I regret , Doctor ... I cannot be part of your plan . Then I must do it alone . While it lives , no one is safe . [ SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] VICTOR : My son . [ EERIE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] What are you about to do ? Would you destroy ... that which I , your father , dedicated his life to creating ? I must . The monster you created is in itself destruction . Nevertheless , I was near to solving a problem ... that has baffled man since the beginning of time ... the secret of life , artificially created . But it has brought death to everything that it 's touched . That is because , unknowingly ... I gave it a criminal brain . With your knowledge of science , you can cure that . It 's beyond my cure . It 's a malignant brain . What if it had another brain ? Another brain ! [ EERIE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES ] LUDWIG : Bohmer ! Dr. Bohmer ! [ FREQUENCY WIRE CRACKLING ] What is it , Doctor ?

You have agreed . You are going to help him , Doctor ? You are giving him life . Yes , but not for the purpose that you think , Ygor . I 'm giving him strength so that an operation may be successful . YGOR : An operation ? Yes , I 'm giving him another brain . You must explain to him when he becomes conscious . You must make him understand . Whose brain ? - BOHMER : Kettering ? - LUDWIG : Yes , Kettering . A man of character and learning . The monster will cease to be an evil influence ... and become everything that is good . No ! You cannot take my friend away from me . He 's all that I have , nothing else . You 're going to make him your friend , and I will be alone . It will be as I say , or he must be destroyed . He cannot be destroyed . There is one way . - BOHMER : By dissection . - YGOR : No . Not that . Doctor . Ygor 's body 's no good . His neck is broken , crippled and distorted ... lame and sick from the bullets your brother fired into me . You can put my brain in his body . Your brain ? YGOR : You can make us one . YGOR : We 'll be together always ... my brain and his body ... together . You 're a cunning fellow , Ygor . Do you think that I 'd put your sly and sinister brain into the body of a giant ? That would be a monster indeed . You 'll do as I tell you , or I 'll not be responsible for the consequences . Ironic , isn 't it , Doctor ? Yes , the monster 's victim shall inherit his body . And everlasting life . Build up the voltage potential to its maximum .

So you 're going to let Frankenstein do this operation ... to put the brain of his friend into our friend . - Our friend ? - Yeah . You , the great Dr. Bohmer ... who taught Frankenstein everything he knows . How would you like to be the leader of your profession in this state ? The head of the medical commission ? The regent of the university ? You weave a pretty fairy tale , crooked neck . How could that be accomplished ? You will see to it ... that the brain of Kettering does not go into the head of the monster . But why ? My brain will go into it . - You fool , you 'd die . - Die ! I will live again . Only this crooked body will die . I will live forever . My brain in that body would make me a leader of men . We would rule the state ... and even the whole country .

What are you trying to insinuate , Erik ? Perhaps you would care to search the estate . I warn you , if you contemplate such presumption ... you will not be welcome here in the future as my guest . That won 't be necessary . If you 'll permit me to have a few words with Dr. Kettering ... Unfortunately , Dr. Kettering has had to leave suddenly ... owing to illness in his family . He was here yesterday evening . I saw him . Quite so . He left early this morning . You were at the station to watch the morning train ? Dr. Kettering was not on the morning train . [ TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] ERIK : I 'll have to risk your displeasure , Doctor . We will search the premises . LUDWIG : Very well .

An auxiliary operating room , maintained at a very low temperature . It 's not in use now . Will you lead us , Doctor ?

[ SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES ] How did the patient react to the anaesthetic ? Surprisingly well , particularly the spinal . I think I can safely say everything is ready .

[ EERIE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] BOHMER : I must warn you ... this operation may not be successful . This may be the end of everything .

LUDWIG : Will he thank us for giving him a new lease on life ? LUDWIG : Or will he object to finding his ego living in that human junk heap ? There 's no sign of returning consciousness yet , Doctor . I anticipated this . Let me know immediately if there 's a change in his condition . Certainly , sir .

She was stolen , stolen by the fiend who murdered Carl and Josef . We 've searched the hills , the mountains and the forests , and he can 't be found . Why can 't he be found ? Why can 't the police find him ? There 's a very good reason . He 's being harboured , protected by someone .

Two men have been murdered , and we want that maniac . My little child has been stolen . The law in Vasaria has done everything in its power to apprehend this monster . Maybe Dr. Frankenstein can tell us where he is . [ MEN SHOUTING AFFIRMATIVELY ] ERIK : Nothing 's to be gained by hasty action . Nothing 's to be gained by waiting either ... when the prosecutor 's in love with Frankenstein 's daughter . ERIK : That has nothing to do with my duty . Let me have a few moments alone with Dr. Frankenstein . If he 's concealing this monster , he must be made to give him up . If he refuses , you can take any action you want to .

They think he knows something about the monster 's disappearance . What can we do ? I 've got to see him before they do , or I can 't be responsible for the consequences . - What is it you want ? - The villagers are getting out of hand . If you expect the protection of my office , you 'll have to be frank . There are certain matters which must be clarified . - What do you mean ? - The case of Dr. Kettering . He did not return home . He wasn 't even expected there . He did not leave Vasaria by train , as you intimated . Your servants say his clothes are still in his room ... which is locked by your orders . I think the time 's come for a showdown , Doctor . Perhaps you 're right , Erik . Come with me . [ SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ] [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] - LUDWIG : May I have a word with you ? - BOHMER : Yes , sir . It is imperative that we see the patient . What is his condition ? His recuperative powers have proved tremendous . He appears to have complete control of all his faculties . Why did you deny that you were concealing the monster , Doctor ? It was necessary for a while . You see , Erik , the monster , as you know , was a homicidal maniac . He killed Dr. Kettering , but Dr. Kettering lives again . His brain is now inside the skull of the monster . LUDWIG : I have replaced an evil brain with a good one . I have made amends for the great tragedy ... that my father and brother unintentionally brought to this community . I 've restored the good name of Frankenstein . Let me show you .

I could not bear . - Nice work boss . - Who tied that cage ? I do not know . One of the loaders . Pretty crap job . Go get an empty . I have to cage this cat . Wait for me in the baggage handling , honey . The rest of you people better go for covering . Everything was running fine . Was all excited about your coming home ... And then this thing happened to Dorothy . How serious is it ? Some sort of a glandular trouble . Why didn 't you write me about it ? Why worry you . I left her at the Crestview Sanatorium about two weeks ago . We 've been with several doctors and all recommended take it to this Dr. Walters It really was an ordeal Poor little Dorathy was as nervous as could be . My mind was seted easy about having brought her to the right place when , I picked up one of the medical books and I read some of his achivements . Medicine and Surgery . " Glands and their secretions " by Dr. Sigmund Walters . " Dr. Sigmund Walters , of Crestview Sanatorium , " He made not one but three attempts of racial improvment . " " He discovered vitamin E-2 , which he belive , determines the physical characteristics of all forms of animal life ... " " The 48 chromosomes which shape heredity and the numerous hormones . " I realized she wasn 't listening to thing I set down and tried to comfort her , but it was no use The storm outside wasn 't helping us either . Coming through the book I ran across to some of the most fantastic achievements of this Dr. Walters Such as a hand , three times as hard as should be reduced to normal . A complete deformed child corrected by his glandular treatments Described in words I didn 't understand how he changed a man 's distorted feature . ACROMEGALIC FORM . " The Acromegalic Form " " Due to a hypersecretion in the anterior portion front ... " " of the pituitary glande " . - Dr. Walters will receive you now . - Thank you . I 'm Dr. Walters . Want to sit down ? - You Smoke ? - No , thanks . I smoke that is , but I don 't care for now . I see . - Which one is Dorothy ? - I am . - You 're her sister . - Yes You are both connected to the Whipple circus ? That 's right . Well what seems to be the trouble ? Well , I ... Dorothy has been losing weight all season . We thought maybe it was overwork and ... Please Continue . The reason much us to tell . At the close of the season , a few days ago , she suddenly collapsed . The doctor thought it was a glandular disorder , and recommended to we bring her to you . Most ills are traceable to the glandular problems . Could you prepare Miss . Colman to examination , please ? Sit down , please . Make yourself comfortable . Thank you . You both perform in the circus ? No , my sister is . I 'm Mr. Whipple 's secretary . I see . In a way we have something in common . In your business you use animals for entertainment purposes . I in the other hand , use them for scientific experiments . So , I read medical journals . You 've accomplished great things . Oh , I 've hardly scratched the surface . There 's so much more to be done . One fears a single lifetime is far too short . The patient is ready , doctor . - You excuse me ? It won 't be long ... After our true talking , I realized we were lucky to get him , because he really was a very famous scientist besides being one of the most charming man I 've ever met . Oh , so that 's how it is . Is he young ? So so . Good looking ? Of course , oh sure ! Tell me more about it . Well , he is ... taking me out to dinner a few times . Well , maybe I better have a look on this guy , pretty quick . Oh , you will . Maybe at the winter quarters when we get there . I invited him . WINTER QUARTERS . JOHN WHIPPLE 'S CIRCUS Nothing has changed a bit . I 'll be with in a minute , honey . I 'm gonna surprising you . OK . - It can 't be that tough , John . - Well is pretty dif ... Fred ! Well , you old tiger bait . How are you ? - Well , I 'm not in a wheelchair yet . - How was the trip ? Fine . Got everything I wanted . - Everything . - Oh , that 's great ! I 've heard you had a little troble on the dock . Oh , Yes . One of the cats got loose . No body was hurt . Say look ! When we gonna know for about the Beatty ? Well , haven 't signed yet , but ... Do you think it was wise , to take all this new bunch of cats ... without having Beatty signing the stage there for you ? Now , is gonna be all right , Fred . Is gonna Be Alright . Oh , Dr. Walters . I 'm so glad to see you . - I took at your word , you see ? - How is Dorothy ? She is showing exciting improvement ... But I still have to keep her on observation for a quite some time . I don 't know how to thank you for your interest in the case . Mean you tell me that you got the both of them ? - Yes - It 's wonderful . Mr. Whipple , this is Dr. Walters . - Hello , doctor . Beth just told me good deal about you . And Mr. Mason , Fred Mason . Miss . Colman told me a good deal about you . - Is talking a little so , isn 't she ? - Yes , but efficient . You know , I always wanted to get behind the scenes in circus . So I accepted Miss Colman 's invitation . Good ! Just in time we 're going out look over the stable . - Would you like to join us ? - I 'll be delighted ! Oh fine . Come on with us . He brought back some wonderful things . I think we can ... If that wire comes on Beatty , let me know . You better go . Come on . Let 's get a closer look . What do you think ? Pretty vicious looking . Yeah , we will have them toned down before long . That should be a interesting process . I like to watch it some time . - You are welcome at any time , doctor . - Thank you . Here come the lions . Say , look at that baby . Is Nero . It 's a killer . He got four natives in the jungle and mangle a handler aboard the ship . Maybe we ought get rid of him . One of the zoos would buy him . Oh , no , you don 't . It 's for me . I 'll get him in a tame . - Any problem , Tony ? - No , they handle like babies . - What do you think ? - Well , it 's a fine health lot . - Fred ! - Oh , Curley . - Wow , it 's good to see you , Fred . - Finally , is good to be back . - Did all right , ah ? - Yes - How many ? - Forty . - Forty . Forty ? - Yes I will feed them , but ... You gonna explain meat last Tuesday , though . Must have a lot of money invested in this cats . Well , is not the cost is the appeal . Oh , you 'll enjoy this . Well , I can imagine what 's gonna happen when they put Tigers in with them . Is the intention to mix lions with tigers together ? Yes , sir , that 's the idea a mixed act . Get back . Help ! Cheela ! Cheela ! Let go ! Let go ! Get back there . No , John . No no . Here . You should no about mistreat animals . I was just just bringing our fellow water . Are you been warned about not to drinking on the job . You 're fired ! Get out of here ! Come on ! Get out ! Well , this is a surprise . Why did not you tell me about this ? Oh , she is terrific . She is almost human . She is the center respect to the act , John . Look , I want to show you something . Come , come Cheela , here . Turn around , turn around . She seems to have far above the average intelligence . She has a natural talent . I want to show you something else . Turn around , Cheela . Cheela , I want you meet my boss , Mr. Whipple . And , Dr. Walters , a friend . When did you get time for all this ? On the boat coming over . Jonh , she isa natural . I think I can do wonders with her . I want take charge of her personally . Training , feeding , and everything . Before you got the job . Do you have many inquiries about selling this animals ? Yes , sometimes . If you take an animal like this , suppose someone will buy it . Oh , well if this animal works for the circus , and looks like she will ... all the money in town couldn 't buy her . He 's dead . I 've come to this conclusion , Ms. Strand , The type of species which we made experiments are not satisfactory . Size , strength , the will to live , the essentials that we are trying to accomplish ... like in these animals . We have the elements which could make possible the we try to do . I don 't understand . It 's been proven with no doubt ... The glands can transform phisical mater to any size , shape or appearance . Yes , that 's true . We have here in this sanatorium a rare case of follicular cyst ... which induce the secretion of an inusual amount of sexual hormones . - Miss . Colman ? - Yes If we been able to create , through the median glandular extraction of specimens that have . What 's to prevent us transfusing these glandular extractions ... from a human being into a higher type of animal ? The Authorities . They won 't permit it . I see you 're not trully a scientist , Miss . Harper Strand . The thing we are trying to do we must be getting . - I 'll be out this afternoon . - Yes , doctor . Photograph that . 20 years in the show business and now I get the ball on rush . And all because of a stinky over grown monkey . How do I like that ... This is why I 'm here . How would you like to get back that ape , and Whipple ? Hey , get out ! Can 't you see we 're talking business ? Yeah ... What it 's all about , Mister ? I would like to get that ape . You think you could steal it from there ? Steal it ? Just like that ! So easy ? Sure ! How much ? I will not give out the price if is reasonable . When do I get paid ? Just as soon as the animal is on my truck . It 's a deal , Mister . You got yourself a monkey . How about us having a little drink , hein ? A little drink to a monkey business . Waiter . Hey ! Doc ! Doc ! Well , the ape is in the truck . Well , how about my money ? What did you do ? No ! Help me , doc ! Doc ! Wait ! I won 't say ... doc ! CIRCUS HANDLER MURDERED BY APE ! MAN KILLED BY STRANGULATION NAILS OF BEAST PRESS THROUGH BACK OF NECK SERVERING SPINAL CORD Yes , I understand . You can depend on me chief , absolutely . I give you my word of honor . All right , all right chief . We got to find that animal . They are holding me responsible . She 's bound to turn up . She can 't stay out of site forever . If she attacks anybody else , we are out of business , you know that . Well , we will find out . Do not worry about it . Oh , you don 't worry about it ? Cheela , we are in the road to great things . You 're the answer of years of planning . Fred . Oh , hello Beth . Where you been ? At the sanatorium . Dorothy was operated on . Operated on ? Why Dr. Walters said treatment would do the trick . Apparently it didn 't . - Fred , I 'm so worried about her . - She 'll be all right . You can 't expect them to do miracles . Those things just take time . - We are ready for you , boss ! - All right ! I don 't will get you down . Come on , give me a smile . That 's better . Well , I take it out . Keep your chin up , beautiful . My God ! Don 't go get in panic . That 's the first thing you got to learn on animal training . But you 're not in love with him . Another gun ! Quick ! See ? Just like I said . Nothing happened . We 've did it ! We 've did it ! - Dr. Walters , we can 't go on with that . - Why not ? In the past i 've been willing to helping you in experiments with animals ... But this is different . I can 't have my hands staining with human blood . Look at that girl . Slowly but surely , you 're taking the life out of her . It 's Murder , Doctor . You can 't do it ! Why shoud a single life be considering too important ? Look Dr. Walters , For 13 years I worked with you , Shared your experiments , Watch you gain the highest honors in the field of endocrinology . I see you gain control of the physical characteristics of men ... and change the breed and sex of animals . I 've listen your dreams of create a race of supermen . Isn 't that a lot of intent ? But while been doing you lost sight for something else . - And that is ? - Yourself . I saw you at start watched you grow , Watched your brain that once was fine and brilliant begin to get weak ... and playing with things that no man or woman should ever touch . Now maybe you listen to me . Haven 't I proved beyond any doubt the glands can transform phisical matter to any size , shape or appearance ? Yes , you have . But ain 't doing this ... When you took the glands from the guinea pig and graft into the rabbit , the guinea pig died . When you grafted the frog 's glands into a white mouse , the frog died . And now you propose to experiment with an ape and a woman . That woman will eventually die . Then she will die in the advance of science . And suppose your experiment is successful , what will you have ? A human form with animal instincts . I won 't let you do ! I 'm going to the police ! You must stop ! You 're right , Miss Strand . My new creation needs the element of mental stability that can not come from a human brain . Miss . Colman is essential to me for continue glandular injections . Transplanting of cerebrum is certain death to her . I can 't afford that . But you are a woman with a very receptive mind . - No - You 're right . The cerebrum is essential for the success of this experiment . No ! Don 't do it ! Stop ! The sacrifice of Miss . Strand for the cerebrum operation proved worthwhile - Dorothy Colman 's condition improving - She will continue to be useful to me - I saw it began and watched grew , Watched your brain that once was fine and brilliant begin to get weak ... and playing with things that no man or woman should ever touch . You are Paula Dupree . Do you remember what happened ? Do you remember anything from your past life ? Your mind is my mind . Your every thought is my thought . What I tell you to do , you will do . What I tell you not to do , you will not do . Do you understand that , Paula Dupree ? What do you have ? A human form with animal instincts . The mentality of Cheela , now Paula Dupree , is improving - it will be interesting to see how she reacts to her old environment , particularly Fred Mason - I have 20 tigers , 20 lions and no Beatty . My idea is close the show . - I would 't say that . - What you talking about ? He is the only man in the world can handle a show that with that many animals in it . I 'd like to take a crack at . Oh , no , wait , Fred . Captive and training one at the time that 's one thing . But to go into a cage with mixed animals and put in a show ... that 's quite another . Only you can 't just give up now . You 're in this too deep . Now Fred , I know you 're one of the best animal man in the business . All right , why don 't you let me try ? I tell you what I 'll do . I 'll start with one lion and one tiger and if I can not handle them , I 'll say no more about it . No , I can 't do it , Fred , it 's too ... Hein ? So we are on ? If you got nerve enough to try it , go ahead . That 's a deal . That 's a deal . What did he say ? Honey , I sold him my idea . I 'm putting on the animal act . You 'll what ? - Yes Fred , you can 't . I won 't let you . Oh , honey , don 't start to talking that way . This is one big break of my life . This is because I love you so damn much . Oh Fred , I 'm so afraid for you . As long as you are out there waiting for me we got nothing to be afraid of . Could you retype ... ? When you have time , do not hurry . Slowly . Ok , let him in . You know what is the matter with them ? I do not know . They seem to be afraid of something . - Hello , doctor . Good to see you again . - Mr. Whipple . Miss . Colman . - Doctor . - This is Miss Dupree a patient of mine . - How do you do ? I hope you don 't mind I dropping in like this . Oh , not at all . As a matter of fact you 're just in time . Fred is trying on a lion and a tiger together . It 's the first time ? As a matter of fact it is , we are all a little on edge . OK , Bill , let in the tiger . Caution , the lion ! Hal ! Curley ! Do something , quick , someone ! Joe , Hal , bring your posts ! What you gonna do ? Oh you were marvelous Miss . I do not know how to thank you . - Fred , anybody hurt ? - No , I 'm all right . Stewart ! Go and get that hose ! Get the hose ! After all these years in the show business I ain 't seen anything like that girl . She had that lion terrored to death . Miss , never saw anybody do that before in my life . No gun , no weapon , nothing . I saw that cat back away from her . You know we can use a girl like her around here . What do you say , Miss ? First we better to do is take care of that head of yours , Mason . Won 't be a better idea . Come on . I do thank ... He talked to me and I let him ... This whole thing is unatural . You should ... You 'll never have an opportunity like this again . I tell you , that girl 's power with animals is uncanny . You saw for yourself what she can do yesterday . Yes , I saw . Also I heard you lying in that cage . It was only by the hand of fate that girl have no long . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . With her as extra assistent handler . Oh , a cage full of animals with a girl mix up . Doesn 't make sense , Fred . I don 't intend to have a mix up act . All I need is a handler stending outside in case of trouble . No , I can 't see it . I don 't think you can do it , Fred . If you stop now , don 't solve anything and certainly won 't get you anyplace . I 'd rather not owner the circus if the success depend on the lives of the performers . Oh well , now you are talking if those animals ran a hand and that was whats happen at all . Was simple bad lock , that I was there , when the pedestal came down . I tell you aren 't a circus man , unless you let me have talk with that girl . What I tell you is I won 't do it ! All right . Look John , You know yourself there is nobody in this business I 'd rather work for then you , but my mind is maid up ! I 'm going after that girl , she and I are going to work lions and tigers together . Now , If you are not giving us a chance , I gonna find somebody who will . Now , wait . Wait a moment , please . I am only thinking ... You ... you make me feel as if signing your death warranty . But if you insist on , go ahead and do it . Thanks , John . You don 't want to get a hunch that with helping that girl , you and I will make Circus history . I hope it 's not over your dead body , you stubborn ... Good luck . A newcomer , Paula Dupree , has bounced out of nowhere and right into the Mason animal act in the Jonh Whipple Circus . At press time , it was not understood just her part in it would be , but is safe to say she will be a decided asset to the act . So , It 's the big day , huh ? Well , it 's the last rehearsal before we setup the attendents for the show . - Music and everything . - Where you 'll open ? Right here in this town . I 'd like to give the local audience news as a break . - Fred , how do you fill , hein ? - Oh , fine ! Do you think this all will be a success ? What do you thing ? With Paula here I can miss . You ready , honey ? All right , Jim , start it ! Do not take your eyes of these cats . OK , send them away . I hope nothing happens . I forgot to feed them . Doesn 't Paula go into the arena with him at all ? Oh no . No because when Paula and Fred are together in the cage together . The cats seem so afraid of her ... that they get confused . They do not know whom to take orders . Then she has power of control outside the cage ? That 's the uncanny part of she does . When she 's there ... Fred can control those lions and tigers , without any trouble . - Amazing , isn 't ? - Amazing . That girl can become one of the greatests animal trainers in the world . Look at that . - Let Nero in ! - Nero ! - He didn 't tell me was gonna using him . - Well , it 's too late to stop him now . Holy jump man ! Oh , he did it . Fred , you did it ! Well you certainly did it , sun . I 'm convinced ! - How did you do it ? - Oh , that was super hot . Honey , I want you live that easy to trade after we get married . - Congratulations ! You were excellent ! - Thank you , sir . Overcame obstacles . It 's only a question of how long you want to keep the show going . Thanks . Well , it 's a call for a celebration . Will you joining us , Dr. Walters ? I 'm sorry . I 've been away from the sanatory to long as it is . It 's a shame . Come on . It 's just ... 20 years old if you rebuild ... Just a minute ... - What on those marks on her neck ? - That 's what battles me . Is a very powerful pair of hands who did this job . Those deep claw like incisions in the back of the throat don 't seen were made by human hands . They 've cut the spinal cord . Tell me , young lady , what else you know about this thing ? I told you what I know . So dark . I couldn 't see very much . Some sort of weird looking creature that came at me . All right , Miss , you better find another room and get some sleep . - Thank you , Sheriff . - That 's all folks . Go to your rooms . Everything I planned complete destroyed . All because your madness . Your insane attempt to kill Beth Colman . You know what the police will do if they get you ? No , of course you don 't . They wouldn 't know who 's the jungle instinct that urged to kill a female that stood between you and a mate ? They 'll put you on trial ... to you question up , to question at you ... to don 't know anybody is saying . Then put you in a electric chair ... and they kill you . All because they won 't understand . They can 't understand . The one thing I hadn 't counted on ... A terrific emotion will destroy the new tissues near gland growth . I have myself part to blame . I should 've kepted you in a constant observation . That 's why I 've looked at them . I operated on you . Grafted glands from a living woman in your body , watched you to transform ... Now I have to do it , all over again . Graft new glands in your body . Maybe another brain operation . Taking another life to keep you on human form . Well , Are you sure that is all the information you can give me ? It is important that the find her . We open tonight . Thank you , Dr. Walters . I 'm sorry to troubled you . He can 't tell us then anything . He only knows her as patient . Last time he saw her was at the rehearsal . May I have one ? Fred . You know ? There was something familiar about the face of that woman ... Whatever it was , I saw that in my room that night . What do you think it was ? It may sound fantastic , but I think was Paula . - Paula ? It 's ridiculous ! - I 'm not so sure . All seems to tie , and ... They said that woman was killed by claw like grip . Gruen was killed the same way . And all applies to Cheela , and ... I 'm certain I saw Paula 's face that night . - It was a ... face of a ... - Wait a minut . You 're not trying to connect with Paula Cheela , are you ? You said time and again Paula had a way with animals and it was unnatural ... Oh , look honey , you 're letting your imagination run away with you . Take it easy . Well , I get to roll over . I 've get ready for the show tonight . You mean you 're going through without Paula ? Off course . I can 't stop now , even if I want to . But you said you couldn 't control those cats without her standing by . Stop worrying , will you ? I see you tonight . CIRCUS JOHN WHIPPLE Hey ! Fred ! Fred , Listen , I ... What is the matter with you ? You look worried . Well I am . Is the weather report . It 's a good chance of storm going in here . - Oh , we had storms before . - Not this , indeed . But that mixed animals act of yours is dangerous enough as it is . If there is a flash or lightning , crash of thunder ... that 's no telling what might happen . You worry too much . You live this act with me . Well , now you be careful ! Hello ? Oh , hello , Dorothy . I was just on my way of the show . It opens tonight . You what ? You got to take me away from here . I 'm scared . He is preparing me for another those operations . Treatments , he calls them . Darling , I 'm surprised to hear you talk that . You are getting the best care in the world . I 'm afraid , I tell you . I won 't stay here another minute . Something terrible is going on . I know it . I can fill it ! Beth ! Dorothy ! Dorothy answer me . Ladies and gentlemen ! You are now about to witness one of the most spectacular acts ever performed in any circus . The most deadly enemies of the jungle , lions and tigers , mixed together in the same arena ! These feroses beasts ... which until a few months ago , were roaming through the jungles ... Are now brought together , for the first time , by a man ... who will make them do his every bit ! And now ... Ladies and gentlemen , Fred Mason ! Dr. Walters ? Dr Walt ... Well , Miss Colman . Where is my sister ? I just come from her room and is not up there . Calm down , Calm yourself , Miss . Colman . Never mind . Where is she ? I see her right the way . By all means . It is your privilege . Please Follow me . So you see Miss . Colman , you are about to witness something what no more eyes but mine has ever seen . The transformation of an animal into a human being . You can 't do this . I won 't let you ! We 're alone down here . No one can stop me , not even you . You 're mad . I won 't let you do that . I 'll call the police . Miss . Colman , I 'm a inherent believer in the association of thoughts . Someone else once said the same thing to me . Someone with a very clever mind . Like yours . And now you 'll gonna watch this operation , and gonna be helpful to me . Oh , Mr. Whipple , the storm is beginning to rain . Get men along to the exits . Keep thing rolling as usual . Yes , sir . We underestimated the animal intelligence . She scents what is comming . She would love to get her hands on me . Let Nero in ! Why ? I told him to keep Nero out . I did too , Mr. Whipple , but he said the publicity was out with Nero on it . Public knew it was a killer and that 's why they came here to see him . Damn ... Don 't stand , go and ... Ladies and gentlemen , please ... Fred , you can 't go back in there . Go get the ambulance . Quickly . Cheela ! Don 't shoot ! Get the vet ! Hurry up ! Get the veterinary ! Fred , are you all right , son ? Yes , I 'm all right . There are deep slashes . We get some help comming on the way now . What happened ? Cheela , she came back . She got me out of tha cage , just when one of the cats had me . All right , all right you men , go and get the work . Check those cages and see if they 're locked . The rest of you , start pulling out the big top . She 's dead . Here now , Fred . Fred . I gonna get you to the doctor . Do not worry buddy . Let 's go . And so , behind these gates is buried the legend of a death that was beyond human powers and he played with things that no man should play .

 The prisoner , John Garth , will rise and face the court . Before this court passes sentence , have you anything to say ? Yes , Your Honor . I would like to make a statement . It is true , I am a murderer in the eyes of the law . But in my own heart I am innocent . I have practiced medicine for many , many years . And I don 't believe that anyone has ever questioned my sincerity or my devotion to my oath of service . Yet , here I stand , facing sentence for murder . I make no plea for mercy . But I feel it is my right and my duty for the sake of my daughter , and those few of my own profession like Dr. Paul Ames , who 've come here to speak in my behalf , to say again before I am sentenced that what I did , I did because I knew no other answer to the terrible problem my patient could not solve for himself . He suffered unendurable and ever-increasing agony , simply because old age had poisoned his body . And yet , he could not die . I told my patient that perhaps I could cure the old age that was torturing him and he trusted me . He allowed me to inoculate him with a serum I had developed after many years of research . But I failed . I tried again and again and each time , I failed . Finally , I confessed to him that it might be months , years , before I could perfect my serum and end his suffering . But his pain was too great . He begged me for the simple mercy of death . And I could do nothing else but help him leave a world that had become a sleepless , tortured nightmare to him . I have only one thing more to say . I have always believed , and I will go on believing until the end that some day , somehow , medical science will find a way to end the needless , ghastly suffering caused by the ravages of age . I pray that other men will go on working towards the goal I can no longer hope to reach . I think that 's all I have to say , Your Honor . You are a doctor , consecrated by your oath to a never-ending fight to save human life . Yet you have taken to yourself the right to end a life that God created . It is the sentence of this court that you , John Garth , be taken forthwith to the State prison and that there , between dark and daylight , within one month from this day , you shall be hanged by the neck until dead . And may God have mercy on your soul . Court dismissed . It isn 't over yet , Doctor . We won 't give up . We 'll keep on fighting . I 'm afraid there 's nothing anyone can do . Take care of her , Paul . Goodbye , Martha . - Warden speaking . - Anson is here with Dr. Garth . Send them in . This is Dr. Ralph Howard , our prison physician . How do you do , Doctor ? Thank you . I didn 't think anyone in the medical profession would ever shake hands with me again . Sit down , Doctor . Dr. Garth , Dr. Howard has made a rather strange request . I think the strangest anyone has made in my 12 years as warden of this prison . My first reaction was that what he asks was simply impossible , but he wouldn 't give up . I think you ought to know that Dr. Howard has gone to a great deal of trouble consulting doctors who knew you and your work , talking with your daughter and Dr. Ames , your assistant . And preparing a very enthusiastic report about the work you were doing . - I 'm very grateful , but my work is over . - It shouldn 't be . Dr. Garth , do you honestly believe there 's a way to ... What was it you said in court ? To cure old age ? I most certainly do . How can any man control death ? It has been proved by Dr. Alexis Carrel that the human life cell is potentially immortal . And for years , science has been trying to get inside those cells to find the basic elements that control us . How we grow , how we think . In fact , everything about us . The human life cell is born to live forever under the right conditions . But when they are combined in us to perform the normal functions of our bodies , they give off poisons which pile up a burden of decay which we call old age . So , death becomes the price we pay for living . For using our brains , our minds , which drive us , wear us out and eventually kill us . But that 's inevitable . No one can escape that . But I believe that a serum can be distilled from those cells that will halt the death within us , exactly as serums are used today to cure , well , practically everything from rabies to diphtheria . Do you mean a sort of a blood transfusion ? No , Warden . This is entirely different . This is a serum distilled from the cells , mixed in our own blood , which I inject directly into the heart . Of course , it 's true that I failed with the only human being I ever inoculated , but I know that I was on the right track . Think of all the aging great men and women in the world today who may die too soon . Just when we need them most . And think of the better world we could build if men and women , if even for a little while longer , were freed from their greatest fear , the fear of death and the grave . Will anyone be able to carry on your work ? After I 'm hanged ? I 'm afraid they wouldn 't understand my records , or my methods . Could you go on with your experiments here ? Here ? I don 't understand . Well , Doctor , I 'm going to take a chance . If there 's anything to this theory of yours at all , I don 't think prison rules should stand in your way . But I have only three weeks left . Three weeks and then oblivion . A race for life against death . Find the secret in three weeks , or never . I 'm sorry , I have no right to talk like that . I should be very grateful for having found two such friends . Thank you . Thank you both . I 'll never forget what you 've done for me today . As long as I live . Well , what do you want ? Just thought maybe ... Might be some cleaning up to do . Otto , you know you 're not supposed to come in here . - I didn 't mean any harm . - All right . Only after this , remember , this is one room you are not to enter . Yes , Doctor . That guy is always sneaking around somewhere . All right , Doctor . No . - Doctor , we 've done it ! - You 've done it . It doesn 't seem possible . The only change was in the hormone count . That was the change we needed . But what we 've made once , we can take apart , analyze and make again . Get me a sterile test tube , quickly . Doc , lock-up time . So soon ? Oh , yes , Mr. Anson . I wonder if I could have a moment or two alone with Dr. Howard ? - Okay . Only not too long . - Thank you . The guards told me that one of the men in death row is to be hanged tomorrow night . Yes , a three-time killer . - I suppose you will perform the autopsy . - Yes . Would anyone be harmed if we used some of his blood ? We need a whole new stock of serum , we have so little time . - Yes , I guess it would be all right . - Thank you , Doctor . - Goodnight . - Goodnight . - You can wait outside . - Yes , sir . Hello , Paul . - We did everything we could . - I 'm sure you did . The Supreme Court says there 's no grounds for a new trial . We 're not through . We 're going to the governor . He 's got to listen . He 's got to . Oh , Martha . Martha , my dear . Don 't break your heart . Please . Please don 't try to go on fighting . There . Be good to her , Paul . Help her to forget . Hello , Doctor . Notes for Dr. Howard ? Yes , but it 's so hard to make everything clear . Doctor , I don 't know if you 're a religious man . Would you like to have the Chaplain come down and talk to you ? The kind of scientist who has no room for faith in his universe is rather old-fashioned nowadays . I 'd like to see the Chaplain later . I believe it 's customary to grant a condemned man his last request , isn 't it ? Providing he doesn 't ask to go on living . I 'll do anything I can . You know that . I 've only a few hours left , and I 'd like to spend them alone in the laboratory with Dr. Howard . I could go from there to my ... There 's so much to tell him and there isn 't time to write it . It 's hard to talk with a guard in the room . I promise you I won 't attempt to cheat the State . I know you won 't . - All right , Doctor . All right . - Thank you . We can begin now , Doctor . - I can 't do it , John . - But you must ! We know how the serum works in those tubes , but we don 't know what it 'll do in a human body . And until we do know that , our job isn 't finished . How do we know what 'll happen ? We know what 's going to happen in 27 minutes . And fortunately , I 'm not to be electrocuted , and hanging doesn 't affect the cells . We 'll draw off 50 cc 's of my blood now , and mix it in the new serum . Then inoculate me through the heart . And when my body is brought back from the autopsy room , apply the tests that I 've outlined to you . You must forget that we 've worked together , that we are friends . You must go on . Learn what you can from the study of my heart , my brain and my blood . Yes , but you yourself said the serum may be poison to the human system . An inoculation might kill you . Well ... I don 't think we have to worry about that now . The State will finish me before the serum does . Open the radial artery , the point of attachment and then we 'll proceed . Hurry , Doctor . And the diagnosis now , Doctor ? Temperature 2.4 degrees above normal . Heart action regular but accelerated . Pulse the same . Reflexes . Your reflexes aren 't normal . What is that serum doing to you ? We mustn 't keep them waiting . We 're all ready . Thank you , Doctor . I 'll take it . This is Dr. Howard . Yes . Yes , he 's here . Warden , it 's for you . Warden speaking . Really ? Fine . Doctor , the governor has commuted your sentence to life imprisonment . The governor has ... Life ? Suppose the serum works now ? What are you talking about ? - Something wrong ! - John ! Come , help me . I won 't need you , Sam . Go on . Go on . - John . - Well . Our serum wasn 't poison after all , was it ? No . But at first , I was afraid . - Why ? - Well , the way you acted . Take a look at your wrists . After you collapsed , you were in a coma for almost 12 hours . And then suddenly you became , well , delirious is one word for it . It took three of us to control you . Physical convulsions were so violent , we had to put you in a straitjacket and tie you down . Shock , of course . We expected that . Anaphylaxis . The natural systematic revulsion to any foreign matter in the bloodstream . - I hope I didn 't hurt anybody . - No , fortunately . I 've got quite a few things to show you . You set a new record for temperature changes . 105.4 average , and the variations were amazing . Let me get you your glasses . I don 't think I 'm going to need them . - What ? - It 's incredible , but it 's true . For the first time in almost 30 years , I can read without my glasses . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Just a minute . Take a look at yourself . - But my hair was completely white . - That 's not the only change . I 've analyzed your blood , tested basal metabolism , blood pressure , heart action , everything . John , you 're not only alive , but by every medical test , you 're at least 20 years younger than you were when you first came here . Have you told the warden ? No , I didn 't want to tell him until I talked with you . I think we should , don 't you ? I 'll call him . The first card shows you the condition of Dr. Garth 's heart when I examined him on his first day here . The second card shows you the condition of his heart on the afternoon before the execution . The heart of a weak , sick , old man . The last card is the record I made half an hour ago . The heart action of a strong man of 40 or even younger , who 's never been sick a day in his life . One inoculation did this ? Will it work in other people the way it did in you ? We 're not ready yet . The technique of inoculation is still far too difficult . I want to refine the serum and try to simplify the method of inoculation . As a matter of fact , Warden , I want Dr. Garth to inoculate me next . Did you ask Dr. Howard to do this ? I volunteered , just now . I think I have a right to be the next subject . - Well , you know what you 're doing . - I 'm not worried . All right , Doctor . You 're a trustee from now on . The guards won 't bother you . Go on with your work , and I 'll come around whenever I can just to see how things are going . - And take it easy . - I will . I 'm in no hurry . I 've got all the time in the world now . All ready now . - Anything wrong ? - No . No , no . Sit down , Doctor . - What is it , John ? - Nothing . Nothing at all . Take it easy . I know what 's wrong with you , John . You 're worn out . No , not at all . You 've been working day and night for three solid weeks . I 'm worried about you , John . - Why do you keep saying that ? - You don 't seem like yourself . You 're sure you 're all right ? Of course . Of course . The convulsions are pretty bad . Yes , but I 'm sure I can manage . Now get me the serum containers . All set . I am a little tired . Perhaps you 'd better prepare the serum . John , what is wrong with you ? There 's poison in you ! That murderer 's blood ! You 'd better go back to your cell before it 's too late ! John . John , you 're a murderer ! John ! What 's the matter with Dr. Howard ? What did you do to him ? What did you do ? Let go of me . Let go ! Guard . Guard ! Guard ! - Doc ! What happened ? - Dr. Howard . Dead . - Murdered . - Take care of him . Come on . Doctor . Dr. Garth . Don 't try to talk too much now . - Where am I ? - The hospital . This is Dr. Nichols . You 've been pretty badly hurt . Doctor , can 't you remember ? I 'm trying . This usually happens in head injury cases . The victim loses all memory , even of events before the injury . Sometimes amnesia continues permanently . Doctor , what was the last thing you remember ? I was in the laboratory . You were with Dr. Howard ? - Where is Dr. Howard ? - Dr. Howard is dead . - Dead ? - So is Otto Kron . - Otto Kron ? - Yeah . You remember ? Always sneaking around . He stole everything he could lay his hands on . Try recalling details , something may give him a clue to help him remember . Dr. Howard was strangled . Otto had been in a fight . - His neck was broken . - Was I there ? - We think Dr. Howard caught Otto stealing . - Probably after alcohol . They fought and Otto killed Dr. Howard . We know Otto tried to kill you , too . That 's why you 're here . But we need the details for the police . Yes . Of course . I was in the laboratory with Dr. Howard and I can 't remember . - I can 't let you question him anymore now . - All right , Dr. Nichols . Don 't worry , just rest . I 'm sending you home , Dr. Garth . A free man . And I 'm sure I speak for every citizen of this State and for all humanity when I say , we will hope and pray that your life will be long and fruitful . And that by triumph in the work you 've begun , you 'll forever cancel all obligations you may owe the past and can now be forgotten . Oh , Dad . And when the world learns of what you can do - and what you 've done for yourself ... - Please . You mustn 't say anything about my serum or my work as yet . Very well , Dr. Garth . We 'll wait until you 're ready to make your own announcement . Thank you . Thank you all . - Our guests will be here any minute . - I know . - I wish they weren 't coming . - Why ? - Because I 'm worried about you . - Why ? You 're so different than you used to be . I don 't mean about your being younger . You don 't sleep . I listened last night . You walked back and forth here hour after hour . You don 't talk to me . You used to tell me things . We used to work together , you and Paul and I. Now you don 't even seem to want Paul to come to the house . You even lock me out of the laboratory . Dad , what is it ? What 's happened to you ? I don 't know . Sleeping or waking , ever since I came to myself in the prison hospital , I 've been trying to remember but ... I was going to inoculate Dr. Howard . And then there 's a curtain , a wall that I can 't get through . They told me Otto Kron killed Dr. Howard . Yet ... - I don 't know . - What else could have happened ? I don 't know . But there 's something . Something that I must remember . You 're tired . That 's all it is . Let me tell them you 're not well . They 're such old friends , they 'll understand . No , Martha . I must talk to them . Come in . The guests are in the drawing room . We 'll be down in a minute . - Oh , Dad . - Thank you . - Thank you . It was beautiful . - I 'm very glad . Victor , I 've listened to you for 30 years , and I swear you get better every time . The only musician I can listen to and enjoy . They 're lying to you , Victor . You 're an old man . Well , none of us are exactly young . I 'm not as old as I was . - Miracles can 't happen to all of us . - No ? Why do you suppose I asked you here tonight ? - Because we are your friends . - No , Victor . I invited you here and I insisted that you play for a very definite reason . Will you excuse us now , please , Martha ? Why , of course , Father . I won 't say goodbye now . I 'll see you again before you leave . I hope so . Sit down , please . I 'm sorry if I hurt your feelings , but you can 't deny the truth even to yourselves . You are old men . Old , weary , fading , your race almost run . You 've helped the world so much with all the beauty that you 've given us and now of all times , when we need beauty to close out all the ugliness around us , your hands are dying . And Stephen , we need men like you to lead , to build . And George , you yourself told me that you were going to retire from public life simply on account of your age . You realize , of course , that all the world would be begging for my secret if they knew . But I have chosen you three of all the men I know because I feel you mustn 't die as yet . You have too much to give . I want you three to be the first to change as I have changed . To get new hope and strength , to add years to your life so that you can serve the world . - Now you know just why I asked you here . - You mean ... You want to inoculate us with this serum of yours ? Yes . I admit , there 's been an amazing change in you , John . I 've seen it . But when you ask me , any of us , to risk this thing that you admit is dangerous . Well , you want to go on living , don 't you ? I 've lived a very full life . After all , a man 's span of life is only supposed to be threescore years and 10 . Who made that rule ? George , your old age is a disease and I can cure it . Believe me , there 's nothing new in what I 'm saying . In 50 years of desperate effort , we 've added perhaps , well , say 15 years to our life expectancy . And the fight will go on . Year by year we 'll make small gains , but slowly , painfully . I 've found a short cut . With one small inoculation , I can add years to your life . Now , at once . How can you even hesitate ? I 've got a lot of respect for you , John , always have had . But you 're asking too much . I 'm not asking anything . I 'm trying to give you something . John , I think we 'd better go and let you rest . Yes , perhaps you 'd better go . John , my friend ... Father , what 's the matter ? - Please don 't go like this . - Don 't worry , my child . - He 'll be better tomorrow . - It 's all right , Martha . We understand . Let me . You are very kind . - What do you want ? - I called Paul Ames . He 's coming over . Why did you call him ? I don 't want to talk to him . There isn 't anything he can do to help me . Martha , please go . Please go . Why , John . Come in . I rang the bell but no one answered . I was practicing and did not hear you . - I hope nothing is wrong ? - No , no , Victor . Perhaps you would like some coffee . A liqueur ? Thank you , no . Tonight , John , you nearly broke my heart because it is so true what you say about my music , about my hands . You know , it 's not so easy to say the end is coming , the fire is burned out . And yet you sided with them . But this thing that you ask us to do is very frightening . Are you afraid of me ? Why should I be afraid ? Are you not an old , old friend ? If I could just restore the power of your music , I 'd feel that my continued existence was justified . I tell you what we do , John . I will cancel all my concerts and make certain arrangements , you understand . Then in a day or two , I will come to your laboratory , and we inoculate me . And then we will see . We don 't have to wait , Victor . It can be done here and now . I 've got everything I need here . It 's really very simple , Victor . We simply open a small artery in your arm and just draw off a little blood , which I use to mix the serum . - Tonight ? - Yes . I 'm afraid that if we wait , George and Stephen will try to talk you out of it and I know that they 'll succeed . Why do you do that ? I don 't know . Arguing makes me nervous , perhaps . Very well , then . We argue no more . I am ready , John , I am in your hands . Sit down , Victor . Bare your left arm . John ! No ! No ! Paul was here . He waited a long while . - I wish he was here now . - I can call him . - No , not tonight . - Dad . I can 't talk anymore now . - Miss Garth ? - Yes . My name is McGraw , from the Homicide Bureau . - Do you mind if I come in ? - Well , no . No , of course not . Is your father home ? He 's busy working in the laboratory . He can 't talk to anyone . But Sondini was here last night , wasn 't he ? - Along with Mr. Barclay and Mr. Wharton ? - Don 't ask him about that . Why not ? He and Sondini were friends , weren 't they ? Good morning . Oh , Dr. Garth ? I imagine you 've seen this ? In cases like this , naturally , I have to interview persons who knew the victim . You knew Sondini a long time , didn 't you , Dr. Garth ? For 30 years . - Did he have any enemies ? - He hadn 't an enemy in the world . Well , whoever strangled him didn 't like him very much . I 'm afraid there 's nothing I can tell you about the case . Except that the man who killed Victor Sondini must hang for it as quickly as possible . It 's my job to see that he does . I may be back and talk to you later , Dr. Garth . I 'll be here . See you later , Miss Garth . Listen , Sondini had a million friends and not one single enemy . It wasn 't burglary because nothing was taken . And the police surgeon told me that someone who knew how , had already started drawing off the blood from one of Sondini 's arteries before he was strangled . I can 't arrest the man without any evidence . I know you can 't . But there 's something wrong in that house . His daughter is scared to death . You ought to meet that Dr. Garth . I ought to know him pretty well . I convicted him . Yes . But he 's not the same person you had on trial . I 've met a lot of murderers in my day , but Dr. Garth , whatever he is , is the first man I 've ever met who was polite to me and still made the chills run up and down my back . All right . You can laugh . But that 's what happened . What do you want me to do ? I want you to give me authority to put a squad of men around that house to find out where Dr. Garth goes , and what he does . All right , so maybe I 'm wrong . And then again , maybe I 'm not . - All right , Captain . Try it . - Now , you 're talking . John . Come in . Let me take your coat . Man , you shouldn 't be out on a night like this . It doesn 't bother me . Come , let 's go into the library . Sit down , John . George , I want you to listen to me and try to understand . I have a confession to make . A terrible confession . I can 't tell Martha . I couldn 't bear it if she hated me . I know the truth now . I know what I 've done and why I did it . And I know what will happen if I go on . I killed Victor Sondini . Don 't move , George . Don 't say or do anything until I 've finished . I killed Victor . And I know now that I killed Dr. Howard and Otto Kron . The serum that I used in prison was made from the blood of a confirmed killer . Some awful force in the living cells I took into my body has poisoned me with an urge to kill . Nothing can save me but my own death . I wanted to prolong life , then I take it . I 'm a murderer . It 's all right , George . I won 't hurt you as long as I 'm like this . But I know now that I dare not inoculate anybody with my own hands . Something horrible happens . Something that I can 't control . I can go to the authorities and they 'll hang me . But then my discovery dies with me , in me . Or I can wait a little while and pass it on to safe hands if you will help me . I want you to let Paul Ames inoculate you before I give myself up . I don 't have to be there . You can lock me in another room so that I can 't hurt anybody . Just give me time enough to check the results and make sure that everything is all right . Then you won 't have to go to the police with what I 've just told you . I 'll go myself . I 'll give myself up gladly . Gladly . Well , you 'll be safe . You 'll be living ... Be the living proof that I 'm not just a killer . George , don 't . Don 't touch that . I don 't want to hurt you ! George , don 't . Don 't ! John , no ! Don 't ! Hello . Give me Captain McGraw in Homicide . Quick . Operator , keep on ringing . I know there 's someone there . Hello . Martha , are you alone ? Dad 's upstairs . What is it ? George Wharton was found strangled about an hour ago . I just got the extra . You 've got to get out of that house . I 'm coming over now . Whatever you do , don 't mention this to your father . Hello . Hello , Paul . Hello . Don 't come near me . - Martha . - Father . Father , where are you going ? - Why don 't you answer me ? - Did Paul tell you about George Wharton ? He said that he 'd been murdered . Here are the notes and records for Paul . Everything there is to know about the serum , how to administer it , what results to look for . I want him to go on with my work . I can 't . I can 't work anymore . There 's a poison in me , Martha . It only strikes when ... I wanted to tell you , but I couldn 't . I hoped you 'd understand . I wanted you to know I 'm not a murderer . A murderer wants to kill . Martha ! - Okay , Olson , stay on the gate . - Yes , sir . Check the downstairs . Reardon , come with me . - I 'm Dr. Ames . - Hi , Doctor . Martha ! Hey , where are you going ? - Where 's Miss Garth ? - You tell me . Dr. Garth ! Dr. Garth ! Martha . Martha . McGraw talking . I want a general pickup for Dr. John Garth . Murder . Warn all officers he 's dangerous . Calling all cars , calling all cars . Be on the lookout for Dr. John Garth , wanted for murder . Be careful , this man is dangerous . Do not hesitate to shoot if he resists arrest . Following is a description of Dr. John Garth , wanted for murder . - Dr. Garth ! - Let me in . - What ? - Call the warden . Let me in . - Let me in ! - Why , sure . Sure . Give me the warden . Quick . Listen , Dr. Garth 's here . Yeah . At the gate . He wants in . Okay . All right , Doc . Stand still . I said , stand still . Stand still . Keep away from me ! What happened ? He kept coming at me . I had to shoot him . I had to . He 's right , Warden . I wanted you to hang me before I killed again . It 's better this way . May God have mercy . Martha . Your father told me something once , a long time ago , when I first started to work with him . " In the war of science , many people must die " before any victory can be won . " Let 's remember that about him . He always wanted you to go on with his work . There 's so much to learn , so much to do . - Someday ... - Yes , Paul . Someday .

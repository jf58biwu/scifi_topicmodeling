 ( OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING ) ( WIND BLOWING ) ( CAWING ) ( READING SLOWLY ) R.I.P. That 's it . Give me the chisel . Suppose they didn 't bury him with the money on him ? Everybody in the village knows about it . His gold watch , and ring , and money in his pockets . It 's a sin to bury good money when it could help people . ( CHUCKLES ) This gives me the creeps . What do you think it 'll look like after so many years ? Just bones and an empty skull . - Watch the lantern . - ( GRUNTS ) ( CREAKS ) Get me the light . Wolf bane . Wolf bane ? Yes . Even a man who is pure at heart , and says his prayers by night , may become a wolf when the wolf bane blooms and the moon is full and bright . BULKY MAN : It looks like he 's asleep . - Let 's get on with it . - First , the ring . We won 't have to worry for a long time . I thought the dead were stiff . Shut up . Gold . It 's holding me . Help me . Help me . Alive ! Help me . Help me ! Don 't leave me ! Here , now . Come off it . Come on , laddy , wake up and get along , will you ? You 've got a home , haven 't you ? Or do you want me to take you to the station ? Good heavens ! How 's the patient , Nurse ? He 's conscious , Dr. Mannering , and talked . He insists upon sitting up . Conscious ? Talked ? But that 's impossible so soon after such a critical operation . Nurse tells me you 're well enough to talk . Why , yes . Pulse , 72 . No fever . There 's no pain ? No . Where am I ? Queen 's Hospital . Queen 's ? Yes . Queen 's Hospital in Cardiff . But how did I get here ? You were found in the street , more dead than alive with a head injury . How did you get that skull fracture ? I don 't remember . This is Inspector Owen . I 'm Dr. Mannering . What 's your name ? Lawrence Talbot . Lawrence Talbot ? Where 'd you come from ? Llanwelly Village . But ... How did I get to Cardiff ? That 's enough for now . You must rest . You 'll be fit again very soon . If there 's any change , call me immediately . Yes , Doctor . Hello ? Put me through to the police station at Llanwelly . Just a routine check-up , Doctor . Then we can close the case . ( PHONE RINGING ) Llanwelly Police Station . Well , this is Inspector Owen speaking , from Cardiff . Have you got anything in your files on a man named ... Lawrence Talbot ? Why , of course . He lived here . Good . Oh , that 's all right then . We 've got him up here in our hospital . ( CHUCKLES ) I wouldn 't want him in our hospital . He died four years ago . Why , of course I am sure , Inspector . I was present at his funeral . That 'll be all , Inspector . Goodbye . Lawrence Talbot died four years ago . Your man 's an impostor . That 's a harsh word , Inspector . Poor devil of unsound mind . I 'll wait till he 's sound enough to remember his own name . I 'm gonna have another talk with him . Inspector . Yeah ? That man is my patient . Not your prisoner . I 'll decide when he can be questioned again . Very well . It 's in your hands . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GROWLING ) I found this bandage here when I came in this morning . I didn 't open the window . The patient must have done it himself . We better cover him up . You 're all right . Nothing has happened . Better get some more bandages , Nurse . We 'll renew the compress . Now , don 't excite yourself . Please be calm . Doctor . Something terrible has happened . Yes , you must have had a nightmare . It 's evident you were walking in your sleep . Call the police . The police ? Yes , you better call them . I 'm a ... I 'm a murderer . Yes , of course . Anything you say . Ask Inspector Owen to come here at once . Yes , Doctor . And what is all this about wanting the police ? Last night , I ... I killed someone . But you were in this room all night . I tell you I did it . I killed someone . But you couldn 't have . You must have heard the nurses discussing it . Mr. Talbot , you 're suffering from a delusion . It 's true someone was killed last night . But it happened many streets from here . Moreover , he was attacked by some sort of wild animal . That 's just it . I turn into an animal . Well , Mr. Talbot , you decided to remember your real name ? Mr. Talbot seems to have heard about the unfortunate constable last night . It 's disturbing him . But he doesn 't understand . There 's a curse upon me . I change into a wolf . It 's a bit difficult to believe , my good man . You see that scar ? That 's where I was bitten by a wolf . Only it wasn 't a real wolf . It was a man ! A werewolf . I killed him . Now , I change into a wolf at night when the moon is full . Hmph . It 's the truth . Ask Maleva , the old gypsy woman . She knows ! Maleva ? Gypsy ? Huh ? Mr. Talbot , you must get back into bed . Oh , you 're blind . Won 't you believe me ? Help me . Just tell us your real name . Let us do the worrying . I told you , Lawrence Talbot . Lawrence Talbot ! ( SOBBING ) Why can 't you understand ? Lawrence Talbot died four years ago . Died ? Four years ? Oh , I did ... Oh . I can 't die . Mr. Talbot , if you want us to help you , you must do as we say . Now , please lie down . You think I 'm insane ? You think I don 't know what I 'm talking about . Well , you just look inside of that grave where Lawrence Talbot is supposed to be buried and see if you find a body in it . Please get back into bed . Yes , get on with it . You 're treating me like a lunatic . Well , you 're as stupid as all the rest . ( GRUNTING ) Come along , Inspector . MALE NURSE : Get that straitjacket . You mean to say that Talbot actually experienced that murder last night ? I 'm afraid so . People with brain injuries sometimes develop super-normal mental powers that are quite extraordinary . Certainly , he got up and opened the window . The borderline between delusion and reality is very narrow . Sometimes , a patient may unknowingly overstep that line . Then that man 's dangerous . He ought to be behind bars . He 's a lycanthrope . A what ? Lycanthrope . Oh ? What 's that ? A man who imagines himself to be a wolf . Oh . Poor devil . Wish I could do something to help him . You know , Doctor , I think I 'll run up to Llanwelly and find out ... You know , Inspector , I had the very same idea . To be able to cure this man , I have to know who he is . Right . We 'll go up together . ( KEYS JANGLING ) Somebody 's broken into this vault . How long is it since you were here last , Sergeant ? Not for months . Nobody 's died in Llanwelly lately , and nobody comes here if he doesn 't have to . Hmm . The door . Well , what about it ? It 's broken from inside . Here . Give me that . Someone must have taken the body out of the tomb . That 's not Lawrence Talbot . Not Talbot ? Say , do you know who this is here ? Oh , yes . That 's Freddy Jolly . Who 's he ? He 'd been up for vagrancy . Hmm . What would you say he died of , Doctor ? Severed jugular . This man bled to death . Same as the constable in Cardiff . Looks rather like the bite of an animal . Aye , that animal . We remember it well hereabouts . And it must have carried away the corpse of poor Sir Lawrence . What animal ? Why , didn 't you know , sir ? There was a wild animal around here a few years ago . It killed people . Bit through their throats . Drained their blood . Did they kill it ? Oh , Sir John Talbot thought he did , sir . He attacked it in the dark one night . Or so he thought . But it was his son he killed . Poor Mr. Larry . Where is Sir John Talbot now ? Over there , sir . Died of grief shortly after . Let 's get out of here . But the body , sir ? Mustn 't touch that . That 's evidence . Yes , sir . Sergeant , if it 's convenient I 'd like to see a photograph of Lawrence Talbot . Oh , there 's one up in my office , sir . MANNERING : Good . Here 's Mr. Larry 's photograph , sir . Take a look at this face , Doctor ? Isn 't that our man in Cardiff ? Yes , there is a similarity . But I wouldn 't swear it 's the same man . Well , of course it 's not the same man . If it were , I 'd be off me top . I think the Sergeant here better come back to Cardiff with us and see if he can positively identify this man . Well , that 's the thing to do . Do you mind if I use your telephone ? I 'd like to check up on my patient 's condition . Of course , Doctor . Over there . Hello . Put me through to the Queen 's Hospital in Cardiff , please . And I want to talk to Dr. Gordon . Have you ever heard of a gypsy woman named Maleva ? A gypsy woman ? - Vagrant , eh ? - Mmm . Well , we always register them . Hello , Dr. Gordon ? This is Dr. Mannering speaking . How 's Lawrence Talbot doing ? You know , the head injury case who went violent yesterday . Did you notify the police ? Oh , I suppose that 's all we can do at present . I 'll be back tonight , Doctor . Goodbye . What happened to Talbot ? Did he die ? No . He tore off his straitjacket during the night and escaped . Tore off his straitjacket ? How ? Bit right through it . Tore it to shreds with his teeth . With his teeth ? ( BARKING ) Bruno ! Stop it ! What do you want here ? I 'm looking for an old gypsy woman . Maleva is her name . Is she here with you ? Maleva ? Yes , she 's with us . You 'll find her over there . Maleva . They told me you 'd left England . I 've looked all over Europe for you , from town to town . Now that I 've found you , you must help me . Come in . What do you want from me ? Maleva . Here I still carry the sign of the pentagram . The mark of the werewolf . I kill people . When the moon is full , I turn into a wolf . It 's not in my power to help you . You 're the only one that understands . Nobody else in the world will believe me . But you , you know . Your own son Bela was a werewolf . He attacked me . He changed me into a werewolf . He 's the one that put this curse on me . Well , you watched over him until he was permitted to die . Well , now I want to die , too . Won 't you show me the way ? I can 't . But I will guard you , and take care of you as I took care of my own son . You are not leaving us . You 're not going with him . He has the sign of the beast on him . He is dangerous only when the moon is full . I shall watch over him . He will murder you . No . I shall take him to a place I know . Where ? I know a man who has the power to help you . Help me ? Who ? Is that the town ? Yes , that is Vasaria . At last . ( CLICKING TONGUE ) - Stop . - ( BURPS ) Let 's ask in here . Are you the proprietor ? I am . What do you beggars want ? MALEVA : We just want to ask you , sir , about a Dr. Frankenstein . Frankenstein ? Don 't mention that name around this town . Oh , please won 't you tell us where he lives ? There . That 's his burial place . The fire destroyed him and all his misdeeds . He is dead ? Oh , but he can 't be . He didn 't die any too soon for us . We all wish that he 'd never been born . What did you want with him ? I heard he was a great doctor who could help people that other doctors couldn 't cure . PROPRIETOR : Him ? Murder and all sorts of crimes is all that he ever brought us . He harbored a monster in his house . A thing created by black magic . Dr. Frankenstein ? Dead ? Come . Thank you , sir , for the information . Come on . Get out and stay out . We don 't want your kind around here . Oh , keep your hands off of me ! Now I must go on living . There 's no hope for me to die . Wait ! Sir , don 't go . Wait ! Don 't go ! Don 't ! ( WOLF HOWLING ) Who could have done this terrible thing ? Could it be the monster again ? Frankenstein 's monster ? No . The monster was burned to death with Dr. Frankenstein . Yes . We found his bones and buried them . How do you know they were the monster 's bones ? He wasn 't killed by the monster . An animal bit her to death . I saw the wound on her throat . What animals are around here that can kill people ? ( WOLF HOWLING ) A wolf . Yes , a wolf . That 's his cry . Come on . Let 's get him . ( ALL SHOUTING ) Come on ! Come on ! ( DOGS BARKING ) There he is ! Oh , but where is he ? He was here a moment ago . ( DOG BARKING ) The gypsy woman . What are you doing here ? Come on . Speak up , old witch . Where is that strange man that was with you ? Let 's take her back to town . We 'll make her speak ! Dr. Frankenstein must have kept records . A diary . You know where it is . Show me . ( GRUNTS SOFTLY ) ( SHRIEKS ) ( HAMMERING ) It isn 't here . " To my dear Father . " Then she 's the one that can tell me . And this man , he wishes to buy the ruins of my father 's estate ? MAYOR : Yes . That 's why I asked you to come here , Baroness . He wanted me to give him your address . Naturally , I refused . But since I knew that you were anxious to get rid of the property , and all the memories connected with it , I thought that in my position as Mayor , I would take the liberty of sending for you . Did he say his name is Taylor ? Yes . And that 's all I know about him . And , Miss . Frankenstein , Mr. Taylor . Baroness . Mr. Taylor . Come in , Mr. Taylor . Come in . Come in . Do you mind if I speak to the Baroness alone , please ? Why ... Why , certainly . Certainly . Now , if ... If you should need a witness to the contract , Baroness , I 'm at your service . Thank you . Won 't you please sit down , Mr. Taylor ? Thank you . I understand that you want to buy our land . No , I wanted to meet you . I don 't understand . Well , I didn 't know how to find you , and the Mayor wouldn 't give me your address , so , I felt that if I offered to buy your land , that you 'd be sure to come . Certainly a most unusual way to make an acquaintance . But now that you 've gone through all this trouble to meet me , what can I really do for you ? I want your father 's records . His experiments with life and death . The records of the creation of the monster . My father 's diary . Yes . You must give it to me . I don 't have any records . If I had , I would have destroyed them long ago . My father was a great scientist . But all he created brought unhappiness . Terror . Oh , but you don 't understand . I must have them . Won 't you help me ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Taylor . There is nothing I can do . The house burned down . And I have never set a foot on that ground again . And never shall . And that 's all the information I can give you . MAYOR : Well ? Is everything settled , Baroness ? No . We decided not to go through with the sale , after all . Oh ? ( FESTIVE FOLK MUSIC PLAYING ) Why , that sounds like ... Yes , Baroness . It 's the Festival of The New Wine . It begins tonight . It 's beautiful . Takes me back to my childhood . Why don 't you join us tonight , Baroness , as our guest of honor ? You can take the first train in the morning . Thank you , Mayor . Of course I 'll stay . Mmm-hmm . And you too , Mr. Taylor . I hope you would accept the invitation to be our guest tonight on behalf of our community . Thank you . I 'll be there . ( SINGING ) Come one and all and sing a song Farola , faroli ALL : Farola , faroli For life is short but death is long Farola , faroli ALL : Farola , faroli There 'll be no music in the tomb So sing with joy and down with gloom Tonight the new wine is in bloom Faro , faro , faro , lo ( ALL VOCALIZING ) Tonight we toast our happy host Farola , faroli ALL : Farola , faroli For he 's the man we love the most Farola , faroli ALL : Farola , faroli His barrel belly 's dipper lipped For drinking wine he 's well-equipped But where his chest ? It must have slipped Faro , faro , faro , la ( ALL VOCALIZING ) The wine tonight is nobly blessed Farola , faroli ALL : Farola , faroli By such a lady and her guest Farola , faroli ALL : Farola , faroli To them I toast Come drink with me That may they ever happy be And may they live eternally Faro , faro , faro , la Come one and all and sing a song Farola , faroli For life is short ( MUSIC STOPS ) But death is long Farola ... Stop that ! Stop that ! Quit that singing , will you ? " Eternally " ? I don 't want to live eternally . Why did you say that to me ? Get away from me ! Stay away ! Go away , all of you ! Leave me alone ! Stay away ! ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) Good evening , Mr. Talbot . Oh , I beg your pardon there . You must be mistaken . My name is Taylor . I know you by the name of Talbot . Lawrence Talbot . You carry your identification on your forehead . ( MUSIC RESUMES ) Baroness Frankenstein , Dr. Mannering . How do you do , Dr. Mannering ? - Would you sit down ? - Thank you . How does it happen that you 're here , Doctor ? I 've been looking for you , Mr. Talbot . And you were very easy to find . The newspapers told me where to look for you . Fontainebleau . Aachen . Elrad . And finally Vasaria . I simply followed the trail and found you . Very clever of you , wasn 't it , Doctor ? Mr. Talbot is returning to England with me . I don 't think that I care to do that , Doctor . Baroness , will you give me the honor of the next dance ? Of course . At our Festival of New Wine , gentlemen , it 's a man 's privilege to ask any lady for a dance . And vice-versa . Excuse us . Why have you followed me ? Talbot , you 're a murderer . Prove it . You 're insane at times , and you know it . You 're sane enough now though , to know what you 're doing . Why don 't you let me take care of you ? Do you think it would do any good to put me in a lunatic asylum ? You know that 's where you belong . It 's the only thing to do . No , that wouldn 't do any good . I 'd only escape again sooner or later . But we might be able to cure you . Might prevent you ... I only want to die . That 's why I 'm here . If I ever find peace , I 'll find it here . Now , you understand . Why don 't you help me ? Sit down . How can I help you ? Dr. Frankenstein left a diary . In it are his records of the secrets of life and death . If I can find Dr. Frankenstein 's diary , I can break this curse and find peace in death . MANNERING : That 's morbid . Besides , Dr. Frankenstein 's experiments were considered rather extraordinary . Medical science never , never recognized them . That 's just it . Why don 't you ask that girl ? His daughter ? She can tell you about things that Dr. Frankenstein did that your medical science has never heard of . Talbot , I 'm appealing to your better nature while you can still think normally . The moon will be full again soon . You must come back with me while there 's still time . Isn 't there somebody that could understand ? Gentlemen , why those serious faces ? ( BOTH SCREAMING ) MAN : It 's the Monster ! - MAN : The Monster ! - ( MUSIC STOPS ) The Monster ! The Monster ! ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) - ( GROWLS ) - No . No , it 's me . Come on . We should leave . ( URGES HORSE ) ( MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( TALKING STOPS ) Well ? Not a sign of them . We shall have to wait until morning . It 's clear to me they 're hiding in those ruins . Much as I 'd like to kill the Monster , I 'd hate to crawl around through those dark catacombs of Frankenstein 's castle in the black of the night . What about that Frankenstein girl ? She has lived up there . ( CROWD AGREEING ) Let 's bring her in here . Stop . Stop . There 's no need for us all to storm after her . She 'll come in if I ask her . Why should we treat her so fancy ? She 's a Frankenstein . CROWD : Yeah ! Wait , wait , wait , wait . She 's a young woman who 's done us no harm . Now , stay here . The men would like to talk to you , Baroness . The gypsy woman is still locked up in the prison . Let 's find out what she knows about all this . ( CROWD AGREEING AGGRESSIVELY ) There is the daughter of the accursed Frankenstein . That name has brought nothing but misery and misfortune to our village . We want an end to it , do you hear ? - Tonight . - CROWD : Yeah . Now , listen to me . The Baroness and I want nothing but to help you . I tell you he 's lying . I heard him this evening talking to that stranger about insanity and murder . I heard it with my own ears . Don 't get excited , my good man . You won 't get anywhere by raving . Dr. Mannering is right . To find and destroy the Monster , we must have a plan . But we know that it 's hiding in the Frankenstein ruins . I can lead you there if you want me to . I know those cellars , well . Don 't trust her . Don 't let her fool you . They 're all in this together . CROWD : Yeah . Here she is . And the gypsy , too . She 's one of your gang of murderers . Do you know these people ? Speak up , old witch . I never saw them before . What 's your name ? Maleva . Maleva ? See ? He knows her . Why don 't you arrest them ? All of them . Lock up these murderers . As long as I 'm the Mayor of Vasaria , justice will be preserved . I should decide what 's to be done in this village . Haven 't we tried before to get rid of the Monster by force ? We burned down the sanitarium . And yet we didn 't destroy Frankenstein 's fiendish creation . We must be more clever this time . Let 's use our brains for once . Whose brains ? Yours ? I 'd rather depend on my fists . There 's no use in storming the ruins . We must pretend to be friends with the Monster . Yes . What not elect it Mayor of Vasaria ? This Monster was created artificially . It must be destroyed by the same means . CROWD : Yeah . I 'll take you to the ruins now . I 'll go with you , of course . I promise you if you 'll help me , I 'll rid Vasaria of this curse once and for all . ( CROWD CHATTERING ) Talbot ? Talbot ? Talbot , where are you ? Talbot , we 're your friends . They must be there . I saw the smoke . What do you want ? We have come to help you . What do you mean ? You wanted to find my father 's diary . Yes , of course . BARONESS ELSA : I 'll show you where it is hidden . She speaks the truth , my son . Right . I guess I 'll have to trust you . ( GROWLS ) - ( GRUNTS ) - Steady . They 're friends . This is Dr. Mannering . He 's come to help you , to make you well . MANNERING : Yes . That 's why I 'm here . Dr. Mannering . But the diary , you said you knew where your father hid it . Yes . It isn 't in there . I know . Please . " The Secret of Life and Death . " " Matter ages because it loses energy . " This artificial body I have created " has been charged with superhuman power , " so that it 's span of life will be extended . " It 's lifetime will equal the lives of more than 100 human beings . " This , my creation , can never perish unless ... " Unless its energies are drained off artificially , " by changing the poles from plus to minus . " But that 's the secret of life . What good does it do me ? I 'm not interested in life . I wasn 't created artificially . I 'm a human being . I 've got real blood in my veins . What can we do to end my life ? " Energy which cannot be destroyed , can be transmitted . " Well , if that 's the case , then the energies from my body can be drained off also . Dr. Frankenstein must have performed his experiments in this room . With these machines . They don 't seem to have been destroyed by the fire . You must fix them . And help me be rid of this thing that keeps me alive eternally . When you were talking to the Monster , I was afraid you meant what you said . What did I say ? You said you 'd help him . Of course I can 't . I mustn 't . It shouldn 't be difficult to connect these wires again . Yes . I 'll need these machines . I believe they can be repaired again . Machines , day after day . What does Mannering need machines for ? You remember Dr. Frankenstein , he ordered machines , too . I tell you that English doctor is no better than Frankenstein himself . Uh-huh . Always grumbling , Vazec . Always complaining . We 've got to trust the doctor . What else can we do ? But doesn 't it strike you as strange that Mannering and that Frankenstein girl never tell us what they 're doing up there ? If it wasn 't for that old gypsy witch driving her wagon down to buy their provisions , we 'd never see any of them . ( SLURRING ) I think we ought to go up there and see for ourselves . POLICEMAN : Right . MAYOR : Oh , they 're not hurting us . None of our affair what goes on there . VAZEC : Do you want to wait for disaster to strike at us again ? I 'll tell you what we ought to do . Here are the ruins . In here are all of them . Here runs the underground stream that drives the turbines that Frankenstein installed . But the water comes from up here to the dam below . Blow up that dam , and they 'll all drown like rats . All of them . You 're drunk , Vazec . That 's why I don 't take your words seriously . Otherwise , I 'd order you arrested for conspiring to endanger the lives of this community . That 's the water . The water rushing down to turn the turbines . That 'll make the machines work . TALBOT : Doctor ! Aren 't you almost ready ? Yes , I 'm setting the machines now . Everything will be ready for you in a little while . Yes , but there 's so little time . I don 't want to live through another spell . MANNERING : Yes . I know . But please don 't bother me now . I have work to do . Remember , Doctor . It must be tonight . Why don 't you lock him up ? So you can give your full attention to do what you promised . To destroy the danger of the Monster . Please , Elsa , I know what I have to do . But he 's insane . Insane ? He 's not insane . He simply wants to die . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( BUZZING ) Frank ! Frank ! Listen to me , Frank . I saw my father become obsessed by his power . He died a horrible death . Just as my grandfather did . Yes , I know . You promised the people to rid Vasaria of this monstrous creation . I want to be sure that nothing , nothing whatsoever can sway you . It is in your hands to undo the crimes my father and grandfather committed . We must clear the name of Frankenstein . All right . Tonight , I 'll draw off the Monster 's energy . And I hope I 'll bring peace to both of them . " Connecting the plus poles to the minus " will charge the energy output of the nervous system , " as by connecting the minus to the minus . " Connect the minus to the minus . I can 't do it . I can 't destroy Frankenstein 's creation . I 've got to see it at its full power . ( WHIRRING ) ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( LOUD BUZZING ) ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) Frank , you 're making him strong again ! Frank ! Stop it ! Stop the machine , Frank . Don 't pull that switch ! Where 's Vazec ? He said he 'd blow up the dam . - ( SCREAMING ) - ( GROWLS ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GROWLING ) ( BOTH GROWLING ) ( ROARING ) ( PEOPLE EXCLAIMING )

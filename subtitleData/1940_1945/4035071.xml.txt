 Now will you give me my chalk ? Try that again and I 'll put you in solitary confinement , you would-be Frankenstein . Don 't profane his name with your dirty lips . He was a genius in whose footsteps I will follow when I get out of here . When you get out ? If I have anything to say about it , - you 'll never get out . - But I will . Now , friend Daniel , shall we go on with our work ? Now , this brain ... if taken from the man and transplanted into the skull of the dog , would give him the mind of a human being . Now , Frankenstein would have severed the spinal cord here but I 'm not certain that he was right . Could Frankenstein have made me like other men ? He gave life to a body that he made from parts of other bodies that had died . Yes , Daniel , he could have made you like other men . Dr Niemann , did you know Frankenstein ? No . But my brother , who assisted him , learned his secrets and before he died , he passed them on to me . Then ... you could give me a new body . If I had Frankenstein 's records to guide me , I could give you a perfect body . Ha ! Ha ! Hup ! Ya ! Ya ! Ya ! Giddup , come on ! Ya ! Ya ! Try it again , Herman ! Ya ! Now , all together ! - We can help you . - My arms are strong . - Thank you . - Take the front wheel . We 'll take this . Try it again ! We have help ! Push ! Ya ! Ya ! May I offer you the warmth of my living wagon ? Thank you . So you 're a merchant that 's been held for ransom by mountain bandits . For the better part of three months . And that 's your servant ? - Do you doubt me ? - It 's a doubting world , kind sir . As I , Professor Bruno Lampini , have reason to know . I have a collection of the world 's most astounding horrors . When I exhibit them , what do I get ? Doubts , jeers , cries of , " Fake ! Fake ! " Do you expect your patrons to believe that the skeleton you show them is really that of Count Dracula ? I , Lampini , took it ... pardon me , borrowed it from the cellar of Dracula 's castle in the Carpathian Mountains . With my own two hands I spread upon the floor of its coffin a layer of soil taken from its birthplace . So that by proxy , shall we say , the skeleton of his earthbound spirit might lie at peace within his grave . Until the withdrawal of the wooden stake from its heart set Dracula free again to satisfy his unholy appetite for blood . At night , the giant bat would seek its victims . But before sunrise , return to the safety of his coffin . Aye , a single ray of sunlight falling upon a vampire would make him helpless . Do you ever exhibit your show in Visaria ? Visaria ? No , that 's a town that doesn 't care for horrors . They had one of their own some 15 years ago when a Dr Niemann tried to give a dog the mind of a human being . They threw him in prison because he , like Frankenstein , used bodies of the newly dead to carry on his work . Is old Hussman still alive ? He 's now the mayor of Reigelberg . - Are you going there , by any chance ? - Later on in the season . It 's a small place . Too far away to make a trip profitable . Nevertheless , that is where you are going . I am not going to Reigelberg . Then Daniel and I will go alone . - No . No ! Now the driver . You seem worried , friend Daniel . If they search the ruins of the prison , our bodies will not be found . - We should hide . - And so we shall , but in the open . All the protection of a travelling show . I as Lampini . You as my assistant . Free to move on toward those for whom I have unloving memories . The ones who sent you to prison ? Strauss , Ullman , and old Hussman , the burgomaster . Yes , friend Daniel , we will travel to the village of Reigelberg ... and pay our respects to the burgomaster . Your move , Inspector . That 's a neat trap you 've got me into . Checkmate . Put it in the book , Inspector . Grandfather ? He 's here , Carl . As a man , I admire you . As burgomaster , I respect you . But as a chess player , Herr Hussman , I hate you . Did you lose again , Inspector ? I told you not to play with him . He always wins . Don 't you , you old darling ? I hope we 're not breaking up your game , but Carl and I have decided ... She means she has decided . ... to take in the midnight show of the horror exhibit . Spooks , ghouls , vampires . Get his hat and coat , Carl . You 're going with us . To stare at a lot of idiotic humbugs ? Not I , my dear . I put my weary bones where they belong - in bed . - Your hat and coat . - I 'm not going ! You 'd better give in , Grandad . American girls can talk you into anything . - That 's all they do . Talk . - What ? - What did you say ? - Darling , remember your blood pressure . That 's the man I married . Talk , talk ! I can never get a word in edgewise . Put this on . - No . - And no arguments . - Come along , Inspector . - Oh , no . - You 're coming too . - But ... No arguments from you , either . Come along . - Persuasive little minx , isn 't she ? - Brrr , I have goose pimples . - Properly so , you little goose . Don 't be grouchy . This is fun . - Master , police inspector . - It 's all right , Daniel . - We have our permit . - Oh . Now , there is something I could really use . - I wonder where I could get one ? - What for ? Just the thing to keep the wife under control . This way , ladies and gentlemen . Step this way to gaze upon an exhibit absolutely unparalleled in the realms of showmanship . No doubt there are some among you who will doubt the truth of what I am about to say or doubt the reality of what you are about to see . But believe me , my friends , this is no fake . Before your very eyes is all that remains of a vampire . - One of the world 's undead . Dare I but remove this stake from where his heart once beat , and he would rise from the grave within which he lies and turn into a bat , a vampire bat who 'd feed hideously upon the living , whose veins pulsate with warm and vibrant blood . Ladies and gentlemen , the actual skeleton of Count Dracula , the vampire ! - Rubbish . Sheer rubbish . - I don 't know . Many people hereabouts still believe in the old legend . - It is true . - I 'm surprised at you people . You seem to doubt what I say , Herr Burgomaster . Bats . Vampires . A stake driven through a skeleton 's heart . Gibberish . Every word of it . Furthermore , my friends , one single ray of sunlight falling upon a vampire will destroy him . Say , who are you ? My name is ... Lampini . You 're not the Lampini I ran out of this area three years ago ? That was my brother , recently deceased . You remind me of someone . Someone I can 't quite recall . Perhaps you will remember later , Herr Burgomaster . Yes , perhaps . Drop the stake from your hand . Drop it . But if you move , I 'll send your soul back to the limbo of eternal waiting . Do as I ask , and I will serve you . I will protect the earth upon which you lie so that before sunrise , your coffin will always be ready for you . For that , I will do whatever you wish . I hope I haven 't spoiled your evening , Inspector . As a matter of fact I found it most interesting . But I say good night here . - Good night , Carl . - Good night , Inspector . - Good night . - See you in the morning , sir . - Good night , Arnz . - Don 't get lost in the fog . - Brrr ! - You certainly picked a night for it , my pet . It 's like being wrapped in the arms of a gigantic ghost . Ghosts , vampires ! Can 't you talk about anything else ? Listen . If you 're going toward the inn , may I offer you a place in my coach ? You don 't have to say that twice . Oh , pardon me . I 'm Carl Hussman and this is Mrs Hussman . - We are here on our honeymoon . - My congratulations . - And this is my grandfather . - How do you do ? Herr Hussman . Permit me to introduce myself . I am Baron Latos from Transylvania . Glad to know you , Baron . May I suggest that you join me for a bottle of wine at the inn ? In the nature of , shall we say , a celebration , Mrs Hussman ? That 's a wonderful idea if Grandad doesn 't mind . Oh , yes . A glass of wine will warm my blood . But you will accept our hospitality , Baron . The wine of the country from my cellar . - Thank you , Herr Hussman . - Driver , stop at the Hussman home . Driver , go around to the kitchen . - Ask the cook to make you some coffee . - Thank you , Herr Burgomaster . I drink to love . A union to last throughout eternity . A love free from all material needs . I 'll drink to that lack of material needs myself , Baron , but not till I raid the wine cellar . Excuse me , darling . Be right back , Baron . You admire my ring ? When I look at it , I see glimpses of a strange world . A world of people who are dead and yet alive . It is the place from which I 've just returned . It frightens me . Wear it . It will drive away your fears . - It 's too large . - It will become smaller . No . I 'm afraid . Take it back . It is the bond that links us together . I see your world more clearly now . I 'm no longer afraid . I will come for you before the dawn . Now , as I was saying ... I haven 't the remotest idea what I was saying . I 've been asleep . I must apologise , Baron . It must have been the wine . - It 's quite all right , Herr Hussman . - Well , here we are . I hadn 't realised we 'd talked so long . I must be leaving . It 's been a swell party , Baron . We 'll save this for next time . - Good night , Baron . - Thank you for your hospitality . - Not at all . Good night . - Good night . Why , Rita , aren 't you going to bid me good night ? - Good night , Grandfather . - Good night , my dear . Lampini , Lampini . - Good night , Baron . - Good night , sir . Lampini . Niemann . Of course . Dr Niemann . Well , it turned out to be fun after all , didn 't it , darling ? It 's a wonderful night . The darkness beckons to me . Another world . The world I see is far away , yet very near . A strange and beautiful world in which one may be dead and yet alive . Rita , what is it ? What 's happened to you ? I 'm going away . The Dracula crest . Like the one on the coffin . - Where did you get it ? - From Baron Latos . Baron Latos ? - We 've got to get it off . - I want to go there , Carl . Grandfather ! Grandfather ! Connect me with Inspector Arnz . Hurry ! - Hello ? - Inspector , this is Carl Hussman . My grandfather has been killed . Herr Hussman ? Wounds on the neck ? What kind of wounds ? Two small punctures like ... teeth marks . I 'll be right over . Rita ! Rita ! Rita ! Arnz ! Arnz ! Arnz ! Arnz ! My wife - in that carriage . Master ! The police . They 're after us . Look , Master . I think they 're after Dracula . There 's one way to stop them . Yes . Fejos , the police ! Ah , Herr Inspector , you missed Ilonka 's dance . She 's pretty too . I will have her dance again especially for you . Not in the village of Frankenstein . We 've had nothing but stealing since you came here . The burgomaster says you 're to move on . - But Herr Inspector ... - No arguments . Break camp and get out . All right , the show 's over . Go back to your homes . Oh , Daniel ? Now , drive on . We 'll camp beyond those trees . - What have you got here ? - A chamber of horrors . The burgomaster won 't grant you a permit , so be on your way . But why ? There 's nothing in my exhibit to offend anyone . We 've had enough horrors around here . Do you see those ruins ? Our village has been peaceful since the dam broke , sweeping the Wolf Man and Frankenstein 's monster away some years ago . No one ever mentions that place or ever goes near it . That 's why you can 't exhibit here . We don 't want reminding of something we 've been trying to forget . But we 've come a long way and the horses are tired . Could we rest here until tomorrow ? No , you 've got to move on . All right , Daniel , we 'll move on . Hand over the money the villagers gave you . - Only your share . - All of it . It was agreed that I keep half . Give me the money . If you try to rob me , I 'll tell the police it 's you who 's been doing the stealing ! I 'll thrash you within an inch of your life . Let me go , you smelly pig ! No , Fejos ! No ! No ! No ! No , I say ! Fejos ! Daniel ! Do you want to bring the police on us ? Get him out of here before he kills him . Master , she 's hurt . May I take her with us ? No , we only have tonight to find the Frankenstein records . - Please , Master , she 's hurt . - All right , if it will keep you in your right senses . Are you awake ? You 've nothing to be afraid of . Now I remember . - Who are you ? - I 'm Daniel . I 'm with Professor Lampini 's show . Here , I brought you some tea . It will make you feel better . That was nice of you . Are you the one that helped me ? It made me mad when he whipped you . But he can 't hurt you any more . They 've gone . Leaving me a hundred miles from nowhere . No , but we 're going to Visaria . You can travel with us . You can sleep here and talk to me when I drive . I get so lonesome when I have no one to talk to . You don 't know me very well . I might talk you to death . Your name 's llonka , isn 't it ? You know all about me , don 't you , Daniel ? - I watched you dance . - Did you ? Did you like me ? You 're pretty . You 're afraid of me , aren 't you ? Afraid of you ? If you weren 't , you 'd come up here where I could see you better . But you will talk to me sometimes ? - Won 't you ? - Of course I will . You 've been kind to me and I like you . - Daniel . Daniel ! - Yes , Master . Come with me . I 've found a way into the ruins . Master , if we find the Frankenstein records , will you make me like other men ? To please your little Gypsy girl , friend Daniel , I 'll make you an Adonis . Here 's a book , Master ! Does it ... Help me , Master ! - Daniel , are you hurt ? - No , Master . Evidently the force of the flood had burst through that wall and ... washed everything into the cave beyond . We 'd better look for the records in there . A glacial ice cavern . The Wolf Man . Master , over there ! The undying monster . The triumphant climax of Frankenstein 's genius and the Wolf Man . They may know where the records are , friend Daniel . We 'll set them free and they will help us . Master ! Master ! Who are you ? Why have you freed me from the ice that imprisoned the beast within me ? - Why ? - Perhaps to help you , Mr Talbot . No earthly power can help those that are marked by the pentagram . You came here to ask Frankenstein for help , didn 't you ? Yes , but I was too late . He was dead . I wanted to die too . Nevertheless , when Dr Mannering trailed you here from England , you asked him for help . I did , but he became more interested in the monster than in me . The villagers learned he had brought the monster back to life and blew up the dam . These frozen waters have held you here all these years . And now you 've brought me back to a life of misery . With each full moon , I turn into a werewolf . I kill . I want to die . Only death can bring me release . You don 't have to die , my boy . You 're wrong . I can help you . How ? How can you help me ? I too am a doctor . A scientist like Frankenstein . Do you know where he kept his records ? I think so . Show me those records and I 'll build a new brain for you . I 'll lift this curse from you forever . He wanted life and strength . I wanted only death . Here we are . The answer to both your problems lies here . And in my laboratory in Visaria , I have the equipment to restore his strength . Then I must wait until we reach Visaria . You must be patient . - The horses are harnessed , Master . - Can you drive ? - Why , yes . - Then take the road to Visaria . Master , is he going to drive all the time ? Yes , I need you here . We must apply hot compresses . The ice has seriously damaged his tissues . What 's the matter , Daniel , you got bugs ? - You 're not Daniel . - No , Daniel 's back with the doctor . - Who are you ? - Just the driver . - Are you going to Visaria with us ? - Yes . I promised Daniel I 'd keep him company while he drove . But I 'll talk to you if you want me to . My name 's llonka . What 's yours ? - Lawrence . - Lawrence ? Do they call you Larry ? They used to . Larry ! Larry ! I have something for you . Look . Pretty . What 's the matter with you ? We 've been together three days and you haven 't smiled once . I think I 'd like you better if you smiled . Now , don 't start barking at me . There 's a nice big smile for you . Now give me one . You see how easy it is ? Then why are you always so sad ? I wish you 'd tell me . Why ? Because I like you . Tell me . Maybe I can help . No one could help me . Daniel . Hurry up with that water . You going to stand there all day ? Get started . We 've lost too much time already . Master , why can 't I drive part of the time ? Talbot bothers me with his everlasting impatience . We must get the monster to Visaria before further changes make restoration more difficult . The desiccation of the tissues has gone further than I thought . It 's not as bad as I feared . Our equipment is still usable . We must go to work and get it in shape as quickly as possible . Turn on the steam . Steam will soften the tissues so that the high-frequency current will go through them . - How long will it take ? - A day . Perhaps longer . Why must you do that now ? You have everything you need here . Operate on me . I 've yet to find a way of combining Frankenstein 's technique with my own . The moon will be full tonight . You know what that means . I can 't stand to go through that torture again . An operation now would be a failure . It would leave you exactly as you are . You must wait . Wait ! All right , Daniel . Master , Talbot is big and strong . Will you give me ... Forget Talbot . We have work to do . - But , Master , you promised ... - All in due time , Daniel . Tonight we call on my old friends , Ullman and Strauss . - Herr Strauss . - Yes . What do you want ? Remember me ? I 'm Dr Niemann . - Dr Niemann ? - Yes , Frederick . Come with me . Pardon me , Herr Ullman . Do you know Herr Strauss ? The garrulous gentleman who testified that he saw me take a body from its grave . We don 't forget , Herr Strauss , do we ? - Oh , I 'm sorry . Is that more comfortable ? Niemann , I 've saved 15,000 marks ... Since you testified for the state to save your miserable hide ? Let me go , Niemann , and all the money is yours . 15,000 marks . A thousand for every year that I spent in a stinking , slimy dungeon . You bargain poorly , Herr Ullman . Don 't kill me . Don 't kill me . Kill my trusted old assistant ? Why , no . I 'm going to repay you for betraying me . I 'm going to give that brain of yours a new home in the skull of the Frankenstein monster . As for you , Strauss , I 'm going to give you the brain of the Wolf Man , so that all your waking hours will be spent in untold agony , awaiting the full of the moon , which will change you into a werewolf . The plasma must flow at exactly that rate , no more , no less . If there 's any change , call me . - Master . - Yes ? Now that I 've helped you with Strauss and Ullman , - will you give Talbot 's body to me ? - What ? He 's big . He 's strong . Talbot 's body is the perfect home for the monster 's brain , which I will add to and subtract from in my experiments . - Master , you made me a promise . - No ! You think I 'd wreck the work of a lifetime because you 're in love with a Gypsy girl ? I 've killed four men for you . Do as I say or I 'll never help you . Larry ! Larry ! Daniel , you frightened me . Have you seen Larry ? What 's the matter ? Don 't you like Larry ? You used to smile at me sometimes , before he joined us . Why , Daniel , I believe you 're jealous . You love him , don 't you ? He 's in some kind of trouble , I think . - I want to help him . - You do love him . But he doesn 't know it . It wouldn 't make any difference to him if he did . Why not ? Why wouldn 't it make any difference to him ? - Do you see that ? - It 's a star . A five-pointed star , the pentagram . The pentagram ! The sign of the beast . " Even a man who is pure in heart " and says his prayers by night ... " " Will become a werewolf " when the wolfbane blooms " and the moon is full and bright . " He 's a werewolf . Oh , no ! No , not him . Not Larry ! - You 're lying ! You 're lying to me ! - No . No , I 'm trying to protect you . Stay away from him . When the moon is full again , he 'll turn . And he 'll kill . He 'll kill . I don 't believe you . You 're making it all up because you 're jealous . I hate you . You 're mean and you 're ugly ! I hate you ! I hate you ! I hate you ! I hate you ! She hates me because I 'm an ugly hunchback . If it wasn 't for you , I 'd have Talbot 's body . Yes , Mrs Strauss . Yes , yes , Mrs Strauss . - What about our beers ? - At once , Herr Burgomaster . I must go now , Mrs Strauss . Good day . I don 't know . I don 't know . The housewives ask me where their husbands are all the time . - What are you muttering about ? - Strauss hasn 't been home . - His wife 's very worried . - Sleeping off a drunk , probably . - I don 't think so . - Why not ? Ullman and Braun , the storekeeper , haven 't been home either . That 's odd . When one man doesn 't come home , that 's nothing . When three men disappear overnight , particularly in a small town , you begin to wonder . Inspector ! I found Herr Braun . Out in the woods . He 's dead . Dead ? What do you make of it , Doctor ? The jugular vein is severed . Not cut , but torn apart as though by powerful teeth . - A werewolf ! - We 'll all be murdered . - I must warn my wife and children . - Schwartz , Meier , come back . I forbid that you spread such talk . Do you want to drive folks from Visaria and ruin our village forever ? I 'm ashamed of you , all of you , believing in such idiotic superstitions . - Then how do you explain that ? - And Strauss ? And Ullman . What happened to them ? If there 's a werewolf , our people should know about it . - Our children aren 't safe . - If there 's a werewolf , let 's find him . Search for the werewolf ! All right ! All right ! Organise your searching parties . The inspector will head one group , Schwartz another and Meier a third . Find your werewolf . " Even a man who is pure at heart " and says his prayers by night ... " Then you know ? Daniel told me . Oh , Larry . Last night , I killed a man . - You didn 't know what you were doing . - But I did . I wanted to kill and I knew that I wanted to . Tonight the moon will rise again and I 'll become that beast . I 'll kill again . Can 't Dr Niemann do anything for you ? - Ask him , Larry . Ask him . - He says he can but he keeps putting me off . I don 't trust him . I can 't go on waiting and killing and waiting . I ... I want forgetfulness , peace . I want to help you . I 'll do anything . When that spell comes over me , I 'd kill anyone . I won 't let you . I won 't let you out of my sight . I might even kill you . I couldn 't help myself . I 'm not afraid . It 's no use , llonka . Only death can bring us peace of mind . And a werewolf doesn 't just die . He must be killed . Killed by a silver bullet . Fired by the hand of one who loves him enough to understand . 'He must be killed , killed by a silver bullet . ' 'Fired by the hand of someone 'who loves him enough to understand . ' Turbines . Now the generator . Check the megavoltage . 25,000 . Increase to 50 . - The electronic bombardment will ... - Listen to me , Niemann . You promised that if I found the Frankenstein records , you 'd cure me of this curse . I gave them to you . It 's time for you to keep your part of the bargain . - My boy , have patience . - I 've waited long enough . Last night I suffered the tortures of the damned . I killed a man . Tonight the moon will be full again . You stop whatever you 're doing and operate on me or I swear I 'll ... Would you destroy your only hope of release ? Well , any sign of your werewolf yet ? We 're early for him , I guess . So he appears on schedule like a train ? Increase your megavoltage to 100,000 . Danger , Master ! Danger , Master ! - Danger ! - Decrease ! - Hello , Schwartz ! - Ja ? Come here quick ! - What 's the matter ? What is it ? - Lights at Dr Niemann 's . Weird lights . Flashing all over the old place . - At Dr Niemann 's ? - Yeah , we saw them from the road . His place has been closed for 15 years . - We 'd better investigate . - We 've got to find the werewolf . Larry . - Go away . - No , Larry , let me in ! Go away , I tell you . Tell Talbot I 'm ready for him . Master . Master . The Wolf Man . The only thing I ever loved . It wouldn 't have happened if you 'd kept faith with me . I served you well , Master . Remember Lampini ? Strauss ? Ullman ? Now you 're going to join them . Search the castle and grounds . The Frankenstein monster ! The Frankenstein monster ! Can 't stand fire . Set fire to the marsh grass . Drive him back into the bog . Don 't go this way . Quicksands ! Quicksands ! Not this way . Quicksands ! Not that way . Quicksands ! Quicksands !

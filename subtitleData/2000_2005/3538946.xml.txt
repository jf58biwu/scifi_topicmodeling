 Shatner 's log , airdate unknown . The impossible has happened . It would take days to recount the events I 've witnessed , so settle in . It all began- - Quiet , you ! This court-Martial is now in session . The honorably sexy Zapp Brannigan residing . Bring in the accused ! Oh , my . Philip J. Fry , you stand accused of traveling ... To the forbidden planet Omega 3 ... A crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences . Do you understand the charges ? One beep for yes , two beeps for no . Yes . So noted . Do you plead guilty ? Double yes . Guilty ! I will now carry out the sentence . Kif , my gun . Wait ! He pled not guilty ! Order ! Order in the court ! Very well then , Mr. Fry . Please recount the events that led you to be guilty . The professor said he was taking a nap , so we have time for six movies . Let 's take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them ! You know what six movies average out to be good ? The first six Star Trek movies ! Everybody hit the deck ! Shh ! Those words are forbidden . What words ? Star Trek ? Shh ! Shut your gills ! That sound , it 's patrol car 718 ! Hide him ! The court is intrigued . Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words ... From someone with a sexily seductive voice . With pleasure . You see , the show was banned after the Star Trek Wars . You mean the vast migration of Star Wars fans ? No . That was the Star Wars Trek . By the 23rd century , Star Trek fandom had evolved ... From a loose association of nerds with skin problems into a full-Blown religion . And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship ... Where they would be no tribble at all . All power to the engines . As countries fell under its influence ... World leaders were threatened by the movement 's power . And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins . He 's dead , Jim . He 's dead , Jim . He 's dead , Jim . Finally , the sacred texts were banned . The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped ... On the forbidden world Omega 3 ... Along with that blooper reel where the door doesn 't close all the way . Thus , Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory . Another classic science-Fiction show cancelled before its time . I 've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice ... That I cared so little about . Next witness ! Bender the Robot , please take the stand . She 's all yours , buddy . I 'd only met the defendant , Fry , once , but I knew he was up to no good . Please use the beeps . Oh . Mr. Nimoy ! I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago . I can 't believe your show was banned ! I have absolutely no idea what you 're talking about . You know , 1966 ? 79 episodes , about 30 good ones . Oh , really ! I 've done too many things to remember one particular TV series ... But if you want to discuss my books of poetry- - Remember that episode where you got high on spores and smacked Kirk around ? No . Perhaps you 're thinking of my one-Man show ... About Vincent van Spock ? I mean , van Gogh . Damn ! Aha ! You can 't escape it ! Oh , you 're right , I can 't . Uh . Jeez , don 't get upset . I mean , okay , I outwitted you , but- - No , it 's my fellow cast members . 300 years ago , they left Earth behind . This planet doesn 't appreciate us anymore , Leonard . Bill , you are and always shall be my friend . But I just signed a six-Month lease on my apartment . I can 't walk away from a commitment like that . Farewell , my friend . Oh . Why did the world turn its back on our obvious greatness ? I 'm literally angry with rage ! Your co-Stars may be gone , but we can still get those episode tapes back ... For the whole world to see ! Come on ! Oh . Yes ! Front row ! You can 't go to Omega 3 . It 's forbidden . I forbid you ! We have to ! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future . But it 's set 800 years in the past . Yeah ! Why is this so important to you ? 'Cause it taught me so much . Like how you should accept people , whether they be black , white ... Klingon , or even female . But most importantly , when I didn 't have any friends ... It made me feel like maybe I did . Well , that is touchingly pathetic . I guess I can 't let you go alone . I 'll go too . With Leonard 's permission , of course . We 're entering the Omega System . Warning . You are now in forbidden space . Forbidden , schmur-Schmidden . What are they gonna do , write a letter ? I 'm so scared ! I 've lost control of the ship ! Oh , dip ! Dip , indeed . It 's all stuff from that forbidden show . So many cardboard sets , so many memories . If only the others- - I guess that 's my cue . Bill ! L-Dog ! Hey ! This is wonderful ! Oh , man ! I feel like hugging you . Well , I would , except you have no body . And we 're both men . Nichelle ! George ! Walter ! DeForest ! Welshie ! Welshie ? We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200s . But the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodeling . Ever since then , Welshie has been a welcome participant in our escapades . I can 't believe it ! How 'd you all end up here ? We were going to Welshie 's cousin 's house to stay in the guest room ... When our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed , just like yours . When we woke up , we had bodies . Say it in Russian . Ven vee voke up , vee had these wah-Dies . Now say " nuclear wessels " ! No ! We love it here . Everything is provided for us and we never age . Check out these abs . Yowsa ! But who 's doing all this for you ? You know , we never thought about it . We 're famous , we 're used to this sort of treatment . It is I ! Whoa ! What a cheesy effect ! I 'm not an effect ! You doubt my power ? I do ! Aye ! Welshie ! This court will now hear some very sensual testimony ... From this court 's ex-Lover , Turanga Leela . Go * * * * yourself . Behold , another power ! Different from the one you saw earlier . Hey ! A body ! Buff , tan . Yeah , this is mine , all right . All right , you gas , what 's the deal ? Centuries ago , the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew ... Rained down upon my planet . Over and over , I watched them . Especially the five with the energy beings . I am Melllvar , Seer of the Tapes ! Knower of the Episodes ! Tremble before my encyclopedic knowledge of Star Trek ! Tremble ? I laugh . Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me ! I beg to differ ! Long have I waited for the one who played Spock . At last , we can begin . Cool ! A Star Trek convention ! Melllvar , can you give us some idea how long this is going to last ? Until time stops . What ? You can 't do this ! Now , we have a full schedule of events . Can people who hate Star Trek leave ? Good question . No , you have to stay even longer ! Oh ! Sign it to Melllvar . Melllvar has three L 's . I think I 've done enough conventions to know how to spell Melllvar . Say " nerd " ! Nerd ! I 'm Slim Shady . Yes , I 'm the real Shady . All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating . So won 't the real Slim Shady please stand up ? Please stand up ? Please stand up ? How can you do a spoken word version of a rap song ? He found a way . For 100 quatloos , who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V ? Khan ! Uh , Khan ? Correct ! My button has broken ! The trivia contest has ended . I now have a surprise . You will perform a fan script written by the ultimate Trek fan ! You have my fan script ? I meant me ! Melllvar 's the ultimate fan ! Oh , I was confused because the scoreboard says something different . Trivia contest over ! Take your scripts ! We have limited rehearsal time . Now , I didn 't make enough copies of the script ... So George and Walter will have to share . You probably don 't want us to see you rehearsing , or it 'll give away the ending . That 's right ! The ending must not be ruined ! We 'll go wait in the ship . Okay . Not till I get my 600 quatloos ! This is wrong . We shouldn 't have abandoned them there . I 'm feeling pretty good about it . I didn 't want to leave them either , but what were we supposed to do ? Usually on the show , someone would come up with a complicated plan ... Then explain it with a simple analogy . Hmm . If we can re-Route engine power through the primary weapons ... And reconfigure them to Melllvar 's frequency ... That should overload his electro-Quantum structure . Like putting too much air in a balloon ! Of course ! It 's so simple ! Alas , my ship , whom I love like a woman , is disabled . Oh , Lord . Fascinating , captain , and logical too . Yet , we need some help . Look , captain ! Melllvar will help us . Captain , I wope he will welp our vessel . Wessel ! You 're not acting hard enough ! Melllvar , you have to respect your actors . When I directed Star Trek IV , I got a magnificent performance ... Out of Bill because I respected him . And when I directed Star Trek V , I got a magnificent performance out of me ... Because I respected me so much ! Okay ! I 'm done re-Ca-Foobelling the energy motron , or whatever ! Fire ! My , what a handsome energy creature you are ! I love you . Hey , you wrote it ! It 's not working ! He 's drawing strength from our weapons ! Like a balloon , and something bad happens ! Yep . So how 's rehearsal going ? Lousy . Here I 've been admiring a bunch of actors while you ... A crew of genuine space heroes , risked your lives to save them . Hey , we 've done heroic things too . Yeah ! In the third season , I kissed Shatner . Silence ! My whole world has turned upside down . I have but one option . Keep them and let us go ? No ! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion ... I shall pit you against each other in armed combat ... To the death ! Where 'd you get an idiotic idea like that ? Episodes 1 9 , 46 , 56 and 77 . Great list , except you forgot episode 66 ! I was getting to that one ! So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death . I assume no one survived . Can we get on with this ? My foot 's getting tired . This will be your standard battle to the death . The only weapons , whatever you can find . But I warn you , do nothing until I have signaled the start of combat . Okay , start . I don 't have much experience at fighting , except with you guys . I have an idea . Wasn 't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy ? You mean Doohan ? Whoever it was , I did it like this . Ow ! My foot 's cold . There , we can make these into spears . We can tie caterpillars together to make bowstrings for bows and arrows . And we can use this machine gun to shoot them ! Yee-Haa ! Ha-Ha . That was fun . What if I distract them with my famous fan dance ? That 's good , good . And then , George , you give them a karate chop . I find that offensive . Just because I 'm of Japanese ancestry , you assume I know karate . Have I ever led you to believe I have studied karate ? Well , no . But you never talk about yourself . Maybe if you showed a little interest . Well , here goes nothing . Hello , boys . Oh ! Hi-Ya ! There 's no right way to hit a woman . Then do it the wrong way . Fine . Is that all you got ? Ow ! Come on , Walter ! Take that ! That hurts ! Let 's see if this actually works . Hmm . Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! My face ! Ow ! My face too ! May I ? Excellent , excellent . Leela , please . This is exactly what Melllvar wants . We 're just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers . Can 't we resolve our differences some other way ? Melllvar ! Dinnertime ! But , Mom , I 'm playing with my collectibles ! Now ! Uh . All this time we thought he was a powerful super being ... Yet he was just a child . He 's not a child ! He 's 34 ! All right , Koenig ! I 've wanted to do this for years ! Bender , wait ! This is our chance to escape before Melllvar comes back ! But we all need to work together . I love you so much . Hello ? We 've decided to work together . So did they . Now , how do we escape ? We can 't use our ship . We have life support , but the engines are wrecked . Ironic , because our engines work , but our life-Support systems don 't . Hey , if your engines work . And your life-Support systems work . Stop ! You 're just going around in circles ! Think , Fry , think . Everyone 's depending on you . We 're too heavy ! You guys need to lose some weight , fast ! Look , Leonard , we 're light enough to keep the tapes ! Isn 't that great ? I 'm living in a gefilte-Fish jar . We did it ! Melllvar 's got a spaceship ! Yes ! In mint condition , and you made me take it out of the package ! The Nimbus ! We 're saved ! You 're under arrest ! Prepare to be boarded . So I boarded you , huh ? What happened next ? You started this stupid court-Martial ! If you don 't mind , we 're still fighting Melllvar . One more hit and we 're done for ! Let 's take him out with us . Do you have a self-Destruct code ? Like destruct sequence 1 - A , 2-B , 3- - Thanks a lot , Takei . Now everybody knows ! If I can ' t have the original cast of Star Trek , no one will . Prepare to die ! Wait ! If they mean that much to you , why would you kill them ? Because I . I. I don ' t know what I 'd do without them . Melllvar , you can 't let a TV show be your whole life . You can do anything you want . Look at Walter Koenig . After Star Trek , he became an actor . Not just an actor , but a well-Rounded person ... With my own friends and credit cards and keys . Well , I guess I could move out of my parent 's basement ... Maybe get a temp job . Whoa . Whoa ! One step at a time . I thank you , Fry . You know , you and I are of a kind . In a different reality , I could have called you " friend . " Episode 10 : " Balance of Terror . " More like episode nine , loser ! In your face ! Victory is mine ! I wonder , my friends , was he really such an evil energy gas ? He did give us eternal youth . 24-Hour Laundromat . A full assortment of rum , both spiced and regular . Truly , it was a paradise . And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan . Let 's get the hell out of here .

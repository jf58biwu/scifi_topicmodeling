 Previously on Farscape : This is impossible . We saw him die . Ka D 'Argo , your son is being sold in a lot of 10,000 slaves . This is a blueprint for a depository . Are we going to rob a bank ? - Yes . In one container is enough wealth to buy the entire shipment of slaves . Zhaan : Now fetch me your master like a good little minion . This is my depository . Are you here to make a transaction ? You seized my property . Guards ! Seize him ! What the hell were you thinking ? My people and D 'Argo 's son are the reason I 'm here . If it 's Scorpius 's wealth that frees them , well , that 's an added bonus . Crichton ! Seal all exits ! Zhaan ! The doors are sealed Aeryn . What 's happening ? The blue bitch said this would be easy . If you fail them , I 'll kill you . Scorpius must be on to us . This facility is Bristultight . They won 't get out . Scorpy . When he put me in his chair , he did something and it 's getting worse . ( screams ) Capture them . Take Crichton . You have no idea how patient I have been for this moment . What the frell did you put in my head ? ! A tiny seed that 's been growing in your brain . You die ! We have done it ! We 've done it ! We are rich ! As soon as we establish an exchange rate for these ingots , we 'll know exactly how rich we really are . After all these desolate cycles I 'm about to see my son . Aeryn , I meant what I said . And now on Farscape . Chiana : This has got to be a first . We 're rich , you 're miserable . ( groans ) A fleeting taste of wealth is worse than a lifetime of poverty . Slaves from the Katin Mines are sold in lots of 10,000 . To free D 'Argo 's son , we 'll have to pay for them all . There 'll be nothing left for us . Oh , there 'll be some . Enough to indulge ourselves a little . I 'm going to get some Bendigan fire silk . It 's for my bed . ( chuckles ) Every time I think that there 's more to you than a pair of pushed up loomas in a corset , you disappoint me . From you , I 'll take that as a compliment . The last time I saw my son was the night my wife was murdered . I sent him away to be safe , and ... he ends up a slave . And if you hadn 't , he 'd be dead by now , D 'Argo . Peacekeepers despise half-breeds . All those vital cycles growing up without me there . I almost hope he doesn 't even remember me . All he 'll care about is that you came back for him . Pilot : D 'Argo , we 're now within range of the Katin Mines . If you wish to contact the Slavers , now is the time . I would like to bid on Lot kesha four . Apologies . Lot kesha four unavailable . What ? ! Why not ? Sold . No , it 's not possible . That can 't be . We 've missed the slave auction . Your information was wrong . I wasn 't wrong. I wasn 't . My people are in that lot as well . Lot kesha four , special sale . Private buyer . Triple price . But other slaves available . I do not want other slaves ! Who purchased that lot ? Tell me . John . As recordings are so sadly impersonal , I 'll have to imagine what your face looks like now . Etched with failure , I expect . I have Ka D 'Argo 's son . Surrender to me , or the boy dies . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . How ... How did Scorpius find out about Jothee ? Stark , you said you didn 't tell anyone about the auction . No , no , I didn 't . The data was stored only on my console . I mean , Scorpius did try to trace the datalink during the break-in , but stopped ... him . I mean , uh , I ... think I stopped ... Oh , God . We led him straight to Jothee . Stark ... Jothee wasn 't the only slave in that auction lot ! Thousands of Baniks ! My ... My own people ! They belong to Scorpius now , too . You know ... you think I wanted that ? Well , I didn 't. I didn 't . I didn 't ... I didn 't ... ( yelling ) This is all your fault . We got your money . We saved your ass . Only when you had no other choice . If you had helped me from the beginning we would 've been out of here before Scorpius had even arrived ! I can 't lose Jothee . Not again . Not like this . D 'Argo ... Not like this . Frell . Jothee : You 're pathetic . You keep talking about how much I mean to you . How you 'd do anything to get me back . But when it comes down to it , you fail me . Again . Like you always do . I did everything I could . - Liar . You know what you have to do . I can 't . No , you won 't . Who means more to you ? Chiana : D 'Argo ? Hey . I heard what happened . You don 't understand . I , uh ... I was prepared to give Scorpius what he wanted . What ? On The Command . For a microt I was ready to take Crichton by force and deliver him to Scorpius . It was all I could do to stop myself . Crichton is your friend . Jothee is my blood . He 's my child . All I have left of my wife . Now , why is that not enough ? Scorpius : I do not care for the others . All I need is the Luxan 's son . The Banik Slavers can keep the rest . I explained that to them , sir , but the Katins have refuse to search through 10,000 slaves to locate one . The freighter that we hired is being loaded right now . Natera did spend a great deal to acquire them . We could accept the surplus and resell them individually to recoup our losses . You mean ... your losses . A poor choice of words . I hardly consider it a loss . Just a small price to keep you happy and settle our account . What , you consider things settled now , do you ? Uh ... Scorpius ... accept your victory . I haven 't got Crichton yet . Tell me ... were there any Stykera amongst the other Banik slaves ? Not according to the manifest . Well , that 's a pity . I could have used a replacement for the one who escaped my Gammak base . Dispatch a Marauder to the freighter , and have the Luxan 's son returned here at maximum speed . Sir . You can keep the other slaves . Do with them as you will . Metal fatigue ? How serious is it , Pilot ? The DRDs found only a few occurrences on this tier . It seems to have been caused by some kind of corrosive that I can neither identify nor account for . All right , I see it , Pilot . If the DRDs can take a sample then Zhaan can analyze it . I would appreciate it . How 's D 'Argo ? Not good . He blames me for losing Jothee . He could be right , so I 've come up with a plan . Oh , there 's a surprise . The Slavers said that Jothee 's lot shipped out on a freighter . Right . Even if we can find it , we could never intercept ... Aeryn , no , the point is ... is that Jothee is still in transit . He won 't get to the depository for a couple of solar days . How can you be sure he 's going to the depository ? I know how Scorpy thinks . He doesn 't have Jothee , which means we still have time . We can beat him . Forever the optimist . Yeah , well , it 's a common human trait . In humans with a death wish . ( metallic clicking ) All right , here 's the deal . We have minimal weapons , no way to hide from Scorpius . If we 're going to surprise him we 've got to get some help . Help from who ? Pilot : Since entering the Uncharted Territories , Moya and I have been mapping our movements as best we can . We 've identified several locations where we might obtain assistance . Item one , we need a Bloodtracker . The Vocarians ? They 're the ones who tortured me . Tell us . Where are they ? Yeah , but they 'll be able to find Jothee no matter where Scorpius stashes him . Item two , we 're going to have to pound our way into the depository . For that we need a Sheyang . Aeryn : On the ground now ! They 're not fighters , they 're scavengers and cowards . Yeah , who can breathe fire that burns through metal like Kleenex . Three , we need a Tavloid . Tavlek . - Tavlek . Remain where you are ! Rygel : What do you think you 're doing ? Help ! Help ! They 're nothing but barbarian extortionists . Their gauntlet weapons are awesome in close combat . And finally , we need the Zenetan pirates . There 's something pulling us in ! That 's impossible ! We 're caught in the Flax . The Flax net . Flax what ? An electrostatic scan . It instantly disables ships . And what makes you think all these Zeltiks are gonna help us ? Cash . These guys are mercenaries . They want money , we got plenty . We get them , we go in hot , we kill Scorpius and we bring your son back . ( Stark shrieking ) ( Stark shrieking ) Stark . What 's wrong ? What 's wrong ? Gone ... They 're ... gone . Dead . All dead . All dead. I failed them . What are you talking about ? The Baniks . They 're gone . He 's a Stykera . He 's ... He 's attuned to the dying . He knows . Scorpius killed the slaves ? Yes . Jothee is among them . D 'Argo , Jothee 's not dead . Scorpius did not allow that to happen . You have to trust me on this . We can get your son back , and we can kill that cadaverous son of a bitch but we have to do it now . Zhaan , we 've got one solar day . Two , tops . If I 'm not back by then , tell Scorpius where l went . He 'll trade that for Jothee . Zhaan : Understood , John . May the goddess be with you all . Scorpius : You 're almost there , John . You 're almost there .. . Okay , Leatherface . Your turn . You never cease to amaze me , John . Man , that 's " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " . That 's a classic . You weren 't supposed to be able to initiate a conversation with this neural clone . Yeah , kind of sucks having someone inside your head , doesn 't it ? No matter . The task is almost complete . It wasn 't easy . There are vast regions of your brain that are filled with nothing but gibberish . That would be high school . Like it or not , Scorpy , I know how you think . We 're sharing now , and that 's how I 'm going to beat you . Perhaps you only believe that because that 's what we want you to think . Sir , the Luxan 's son is returning on your Marauder , but due to delays identifying him on the freighter ... Don 't give me excuses ! Do you think Crichton is simply going to surrender himself to me ? I will not give him one microt more than is necessary to formulate his plan , is that clear ? ( growls ) Sir , I 'll inform you the moment the boy arrives . Calm down . You 'll have an accident . My coolant system has advanced considerably since the original surgery . Not enough to prevent this Crichton from almost killing you . Why do you want him so badly ? He destroyed my Gammak Base . Revenge ? He 's not a Scarran . You wouldn 't waste your hatred on anything else . This is why I can 't have you around . You know me too well . Without me , you 'd still be the same angry , hot-headed , young creature I took in so many cycles ago . Without me , your head , among other things , would be a trophy on the wall of Peacekeeper Command . See ? We were made for each other . ( growls ) Whoa ! Checking on our treasure , or are you helping yourself ? The way I see it , beating you to it . How dare you ! I ... mmm . Fifty-fifty ? All right , but just enough so no one notices . ( laughing ) - Yeah . It 's always good to have a little something tucked away when all hezmana breaks loose . ( laughing ) Empty ? What the frell ? It 's gone . Someone 's beaten us to it . But who ? Crichton 's too ... honorable . Aeryn 's too dull . D 'Argo 's too , mmm ... Say it . Simple ? Yeah , but he 's not a thief . Somebody is ! We 've been robbed . ( mechanical clicking ) Did you hear that ? It sounded like tearing metal . ( shrieks ) ( metallic clicking ) Rygel . Get down here ! ( laughing ) I trust you 're well . I asked you for help ! What the yotz were those creatures ? They looked like ... They looked like our money . ( gasps ) Our money 's alive . You realize what that means . They 're eating the ship . Yes , but ... we 're poor . ( chanting softly ) : Marikar rakmana Tarou . Marikar rakmana Tarou . Marikar rakmana Tarou . Howdy , Bekhesh . Meet Winona . Lights go out , gauntlet comes off . Freeze ! Unless it 's already off . I told you , I no longer wear the gauntlet . I 'm not a creature of violence anymore . That 's good . I don 't believe you . I don 't care . A lifetime of killing and extortion takes its toll . Yeah , especially on those you kill and extort . Yes ... but also on myself . During a hostage raid , we captured a priest , a disciple of the Writ of Tarou . He refused to eat or sleep . All he would do day and night was preach , whether anyone was listening or not . I executed him , but I kept his Writ , I don 't know why . One day I started reading it . They were words of peace , but they made me feel ... better . And one day I took off my gauntlet and I threw it away . I still don 't believe you . Well then kill me or let me go . ( sighs ) : I need your gauntlet . No. lt 's a tool of destruction . That 's why I want it . Well ? How bad is it ? Are we in danger of a hull breach ? Of course we are . These creatures eat metal . Pilot : Zhaan , they 're devouring Moya 's sense filaments . She 's trying to endure the pain , but it 's growing . Brave Moya . Can 't you flush them out or ... or suffocate them ? I trapped several creatures in the bulkhead and opened it to space , but they were too firmly entrenched to expel . and the vacuum didn 't affect them at all . Hmm , well , do something ! I can 't do any more until I have a specimen to study . Chiana is trying to capture one . Now , if you can 't make yourself useful , Rygel , I suggest you leave . Frell ! This is your last warning shot . This is your fault . My fault ? My fault ? This is your fault . You were on the inside . You stole the wrong container . With the device you gave me . I did precisely what I was supposed to . I was heroic ! Shut up , both of you . The fault lies with all of us . We brought those creatures aboard . Moya is suffering because of us . Now , little fella ! Zhaan ! Zhaan , I think I got one . Thank Kahalan . Bring it here immediately . Uh ... soon as I can . Aeryn : Attention Sheyang vessel . This is not a hostile approach . I come with an opportunity for profit . Please respond . ( grunts ) So , you 've come to finish me . Who attacked you ? It was swift . Unprovoked . And where is the rest of your crew ? Abandoned ship in evacuation pods . As leader , I stayed behind to guard their escape . That 's very noble of you . You said you had an opportunity for profit . Spare my female . Please . She bears my children . Down ! Come with me . So ... you 're going to attack a Shadow Depository . That 's the plan . Very well. I will help you . You can barely help yourself . Look at you . You 're weak , you 're all used up . And you 're no use to me . No use ? ! ( growling ) ( gasping ) I 've seen bigger . I can do better . You 'll have to . ( chanting ) : Marikar rakmana Tarou . Marikar rakmana Tarou . You know , pretty soon you 're going to start jonesing for that gauntlet really bad . ( louder ) : Marikar rakmana Tarou . I 'm not leaving here without it . - Tarou bakhaa Tarou . Bekhesh. I 've got all the time in the world . - Tarou bakhaa Tarou . Marikar rakmana Tarou . Marikar rakmana Tarou . A Luxan-Sebacean hybrid ? Despite Peacekeeper Command efforts to keep the bloodlines pure , there seems to be a few more of them every cycle . Have you got something against hybrids , hmm ? No , of course not , not at all . Ka Jothee , is it ? What the frell are you ? Some kind of mutant ? His mother was a Sebacean . She was raped by a Scarran . Did the Luxan rape your mother , too ? No . Your father abandoned you to a life of slavery . is it his lineage you hate the most ? My mother was murdered by her brother . Does that answer your question ? So you hate Luxans and Sebaceans equally . How very interesting . You bought 10,000 slaves just to get me ? What do you want ? From you , nothing . But your father would give me something I want very much . Pray to your Luxan mystics that he loves you still . Why are the Peacekeeper Termination Squad after you ? We were hired to find some of their deserters , but once we discovered my mate was with child , we decided to discontinue the hunt . And you kept the payment . Well , only half . We did half the work . You were a good torturer . Are you as good at tracking ? Show him . ( sniffing ) lt would be easy to overlook the scent of Hynerian and Delvian beneath the musk of Nebari on you . Will you help me ? Yes . - No . You saved our lives . We are obligated . I will not desert you . The Peacekeeper hunters are dead . There are caves nearby . I will be safe there to give birth . Our children will live . Because of him . If we can help restore his child , we must . And we could use the currency . ( beeping ) Oh , the heat 's not affecting it at all . You said they ran from your blowtorch . I said maybe they did . Zhaan : I 'll increase the heat . Hmm . Zhaan : Oh , no . Chiana : What 's wrong ? It 's dead . Took too much heat to kill it , Chiana . Moya could never raise her internal temperature that high . Evil . There are over 2,000 of those creatures onboard . We could never kill them one by one like this . I must find a way to deal with the total infestation . Pilot : Zhaan , it 's Scorpius . He wants to talk to D 'Argo . He 's found us . We 're dead . I will speak to him , Pilot . ( shuddering ) Where is Ka D 'Argo ? Where is Crichton ? They have no reason to trust you . You tried to sabotage our ship . Why would you honor any exchange ? Sabotage ? Don 't play stupid you butcher . Your metal-eating money ... I will speak to Crichton and D 'Argo , now . Speak to me . Stark . Yes , your favorite food for the Aurora Chair . You murdered my people , Scorpius . Thousands of Baniks , as if they were nothing . And all for one boy ? Well go ahead and kill Jothee if you want , because he means nothing to me . You 're not getting Crichton . What the frell were you thinking ? ! You just condemned D 'Argo 's son to death ! Look , Scorpius thinks I 'm mad . He ... he won 't blame you . He ... he needs Jothee . He won 't kill him . I ... I know Scorpius. I do . We can 't let him know that Moya 's in trouble . He 'll come after us , and if he smells advantage to him , it 's the scent of victory . If Jothee dies , I will not wait for D 'Argo . I will kill you myself ! ( systems powering down ) Pilot , what 's happening ? Pilot : Energy failure , Tiers five through nine . The creatures have infiltrated the power conduits . Rygel : So , do something about it . Use the DRDs . That 's what they 're for . I 've tried . They 're eating the DRDs as well . How long before they break through the hull , Pilot ? I don 't know , but unless we destroy them soon , the internal damage may be irreparable . Moya may die . ( grunting ) ( groaning ) ( grunting ) ( whimpering ) ( growling ) ( sizzling ) ( growling ) ( sighs ) Well , that brings back memories . ( sighs ) ( panting ) Does it hurt as much as it used to ? The sensation is , uh , well ... more complicated than pain . You 're much more patient than I remember . Why aren 't you hunting down the thieves on the Leviathan ? That would be a waste of effort . Crichton will come to me . How 's your nurse ? Recovering . At any event , the currency that was stolen belongs to you , yet you seem strangely unaffected for the loss . Tell me . What did you really put in my storage container ? ( laughs ) Karack metallites . Oh . - While dormant they look like Boriniumingots , but they 're actually burrowing creatures . They consume metal in their natural environment . You intended to destroy my Marauder , kill my crew , killing ... me ? Yes . You wouldn 't have respected me otherwise . How commendable . Very fortunate I was robbed . Mmm . Now , tell me . These , uh ... Karack creatures . Will they destroy the Leviathan ? Eventually . For a vessel that size it should take at least eight solar days . Rest assured , the Leviathan is dead . ( hissing ) ( moaning ) Hey Bekhesh , buddy , how are you feeling ? ( groaning ) You 're looking kind of crappy , you know ? Maybe that gauntlet would fix you right up . Where is it ? I can 't tell you . The Writ of Tarou says allowing another to inflict harm is an act of violence itself . I 'm trying to make up for the things I 've done . You want to end violence ? You want to serve peace ? Then help me . Help yourself . Where 's the gauntlet , Bekhesh ? Please , let me go ! I need to have it ! ( Bekhesh groaning ) Bekhesh : Hey ! That 's mine ! Put that on , it 'll kill you . You forget. I 've worn a gauntlet before , remember ? That was over a cycle ago . I 've tripled the dose since then . All right then , put it on and I 'll strip it from your corpse in three arns . You want the gauntlet , you take me with it . Why should I trust you ? You said there was currency in it for me . Lots of it . What about your great reformation ? It 's easier to reform when you 're rich . ( gasping ) You 're feeling Moya 's pain . What I feel , Moya feels a thousand times worse . Pilot , I think I 've found a solution . I want to flood Moya 's affected areas with Adraxan vapor . After she has absorbed it into her body , you ... you 'll be able to ignite it electrically . Ignite ? ! Waves of heat will course through her body , then flames . The creatures will be destroyed . You 'd burn Moya ? To save her . No ! There must be another way ! I haven 't given up hope trying to find one , and I won 't . But if we run out of time ... Pilot ... you must believe me , this may be Moya 's last hope . ( sighs ) The Builders placed our fates in your care , Zhaan . Whatever you decide , we will abide by it . Rygel : Now that we have reached Zenetan territory , I have a task to perform . And while it pains me to leave you at such a critical juncture , I will not shirk my duty . The Zenetan pirates await . Good luck and farewell . You always know when to run . ( shrieks ) That 's cold . Be careful , child . Adraxan vapor is highly volatile . Sorry . Are we really gonna burn Moya ? Do you think I want it to come to this ? Pilot : Zhaan , the canisters in Maintenance Bay Four are ready . Thanks . ( power surges ) Pilot , have you sealed all the affected areas ? Yes. lt 's almost one-ninth of Moya 's total body . Release the vapor . ( hissing ) It 's done . The vapor will be fully absorbed in less than nine arns . Good . That gives me enough time . Rygel : I am Dominar Rygel xvi , requesting an audience . Most beings do not seek out the Zenetan pirates . I have a business proposition regarding your Flax net . I will speak with Commander Kcrackic . Kcrackic no longer commands here . Nor is he , in fact , alive . Durka ? ! Hello , Rygel . I now control the Flax . ( gasps ) Welcome back , Rygel . ( gulps ) So , you 're , uh ... ( chuckles ) Flax net will simply be used to insure our escape . There 's little risk and , uh , great reward for your participation . An interesting proposal . When the ship you abandoned me in was snared in the Zenetan 's net , they were little more than a disorganized gang of petty cutthroats . ( gulps ) Under my direction , I have turned them and the Flax into a tool for power and profit . is that a yes or a no ? We had a truce . When I am finished with you , Dominar , death himself will pray for you . Hmm ... I thought you might say something like that . ( chuckling ) ( zapping and screaming ) ( sinister laughing ) ( weapon cocking ) ( gasps ) I liked your proposal . ( both laughing ) Zhaan , what are you waiting for ? The vapor was absorbed an arn ago . There must be another way , Chiana . Perhaps a crystal resonator . We can shatter them with sound . Pilot : The creatures are nearing Moya 's propulsors . Zhaan , if they consume those systems we 'll be dead in space . There is no more time . On our way , Pilot . Pilot , I will take as much of yours and Moya 's pain as I can . No , it will overwhelm you . I will take that chance . I will stay by your side . ( whirring ) Zhaan , you have to do it now . ( grunts nervously ) Kahalan , help us . Pilot , ignite the vapor . ( beeps ) ( screaming ) Ah , Zhaan ! ( screaming ) ( beeps ) Ah , don 't touch that . ( beeps ) You know , flossing could help you with that gingivitis . ( sighs ) Whoa . Pilot , what the hell 's going on over there ? Pilot , you guys okay ? Pilot , I 'm seeing flames on Moya . It 's all right , Crichton . Stark , there are flames on Moya . That is not all right . John , we started the fire on purpose . What ? We had to . Just come on board . I 'll explain it to you . Chiana , just tell me . is everybody okay over there ? Hey ... I think so . Everyone but ... but Moya . Moya 's in so much pain she can 't even Starburst . Will she heal ? Pilot 's not sure . ( breathing shakily ) Our money did this ? We did this . And since we have nothing to pay the mercenaries , do you think they 're going to want to help us ? Scorpius is going to kill Jothee . No , he won 't . Marikar rakmana Tarou . - Hey ! Hey , frek face ! Hey , you stop that ridiculous mumbling . Ah , ah , you 're not here to fight each other . The Tavleks raided our village ! That 's why I asked your forgiveness . Tavleks are treacherous scum ! Criminals ! So 's everybody on board this ship ! You are being paid to work together . Rygel : That 's right . ( snarling softly ) And that 's what we do to people who don 't . Good work , Ryg . Rygel : You 're here to do a job . Start acting like professionals . ( snarling ) Where would Crichton have gone at a time like this ? I don 't know , but he hasn 't exactly been himself lately . Well , I want him confined to his quarters . I 'll see to it , but you know he 's been trying to help you . Always just too late . ( power winding down ) Father ? Jothee ? Jothee ! It 's you ! It 's really you ! ( laughing ) Father . You 're choking me . ( winces ) Everything you 've been through . So many cycles . I 'm sorry . Not your fault . I never stopped thinking about you , trying to find you . I ... I almost lost hope . I didn 't . I knew you would come for me . ( chuckling ) My son ! My son ! ( chuckling ) ( sighs happily ) How did you escape Scorpius ? He let me go . He what ? Why ? Oh , no . Hello , John . You want the wormhole technology ? I want your implant out of my head . So finally , the rift between us is not so great . You do what you gotta do . You win . ( inhales deeply ) As if there was ever any doubt . ( inhales deeply )

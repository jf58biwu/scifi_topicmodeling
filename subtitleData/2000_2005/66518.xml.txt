Appropriate . You were saying ? well , Iet me show you a few ... william Decker , government physicist , weapon division . 3 years ago his project got ... he didn 't like that so he sold those weapons sold to several major corporation we think ... unfortunately , we cannot link it to ... because Decker 's died . natural course . ... after a 14th fall from a condominium .

No , no.This was a mixed up since this was the one sent 3 years ago . Somebody else sent it . I need to find out know who sent it and I need to talk to them . Oh , you were right . It was sent a few weeks ago . Who sent it ? You did . See , 20 items ? I may need all your personal belongings . michael Jennings is died three minutes after three and government left ... case ... So you see it 's impossible he 's escaped unless you changed something . No , I didn 't . What were you doing exactly ? I was eating pie . He left the ... office exactly when he predicted . The fact 's taking exactly what he predicted . But he didn 't die what we predicted . michael Jennings 's not a super agent . He 's an engineer . Yet somehow he managed to escape from a double locked room ? How ? That means someone who knew changed something and it wasn 't me , it wasn 't you . Has anyone checked the machine since michael was locked here ? Find him . If you only look where you can 't go , you will miss the riches below . The money missing is my riches . 17-44-4-26-37-40-22 . Combination of code ? ... Bank , please . What 're you saying ? This bank does not exist ? Who sent these items ? You did . See , 20 items . Look whose signature is on every one of those documents I 'm not a traitor . Decker died . You 've to believe me , I don 't remember what I did in the past three years . michael . michael ... you 're done . - hello . - Jesus joy.How good is to hear you voice . michael . Listen . I 'm gonna be jailed and I need you . AII right. meet you at the station at 9 o 'cIock . - I 'II be there . - Okay , good . Say one word about this hat , I 'm not here . told you not to take that job , Mic . Come on , Iet 's have a tea . Of course it 's the chemical process . - well . - well , you have some late memories ? Why 'd I have these memories ? Brother , I don 't know . But there 's some questions you should be asking yourself . Now , the question you should be asking yourself first , why did you give our pal that money ? 90 million dollars . Nobody ... in three years . Okay , forget about it . Think backward . They told me that I was working ... by someone named Decker . - Decker ? - Yeah . - william Decker ? - I think so . What I heard was he was working on something level 5 ... shut him down . What was it ? ... a laser . What reason ? 90 million dollars just ... What ? It 's no way I get escaped from the room without the cigarettes and the glasses . I 'd never have got another bus without the bus ticket , and if I don 't have the diamond ring , - I won 't follow the kid to the ... - Right . I gave all that money just to make sure I 'd pay attention to these items . Why ? Because I 'd know ... to ... 5 hunfred billion dollars ... The future . Machine 303 was virus ? No , it 's not a kind of virus . Wait , I 'II show you . It 's not in the software , it 's in the hardware . There got a circuit somewhere here ... But you can find it , right ? Yeah , I can . Then do it . We change plan ... we don 't need michael Jennings anymore . Look , if we know anything we know the time travels is not possible . - Einstein proved that . Why ? - Time travels , yes . But Einstein is very clear that he belives time ... Mic , Mic , come on . May be we should just find Decker . I can 't talk to Decker . Why not ? - An accident . - An accident ? Yeah , he fell from the bedroom window . He fell from the bedroom window . Sure , it can happen . Oh , we got to get ourselves ... Listen to me , I think what happened was I ... I saw my future . But I saw I need to change it . ... each either might be using specific time specific places i mean , ... I don 't want to be dead . What ? The 've seen you , Mic . flee ! Listen to me , take this , ... into the door , ... you understand ? Go ! Go on ! - Shit ! - Go ! Where 's your gun ? He 's got it . So , how are you , michael ? You ? Why ? Don 't remember ? You brought this on yourself , Mic . So , how is it feel knowing you 're going to die ? So you 're saying he has designed to escape ? We 've no explaination . Because we 've to look at all these evidences , hard to accept the conclusion that he has seemed to be predictable what 's going to happen on him . His memories extracted ... before he fled , they don 't seem to end up to anything . We knew Decker 's trying to design something but when he sold his plan , it 's only half way done . I don 't understand . Decker 's working at ... on laser and lens plans He claimed the Iens was powerful and up to see around the ... of the universe . Decker believed that he can see around the curve that round up forever you 're on the back way where you started it . Look it on yourself . - Excepting I looking back on yourself now . - You 're not . No , you 're looking at the future . Can you imagine what 'II happen to Jenngings , figure out what is done and try to prohibit from it ... Jenngings won 't do that . I 'II still ... he never lies ... When he heard he was being accused up ... He was hurt and scared . Why don 't you bring him here and I 'II give him a ... But the first thing is to find hin first .

May I come in ? When was the Iast time you saw michael ? Yesterday morning . ... in the lab . rachel , I 'm sorry . I 've to tell you this . michael left yesterday , permanently . What ? He finished his work . We erased his memory . No , no , he promise me he said he 's gonna to go through this . He has a Iot of money now , rachel . He said he didn 't care about the money . So she doesn 't know anything ? He won 't leave without her . michael is smart . She 's missing something . ... and make sure she can 't go anyway alone . Bye-bye . Good morning , Dr Porter . Going somewhere ? Go and get my bag . Coming ? No , thanks . I rather watch you here . Suit yourself . We went into the bathroom and ... , zero . I want you to go back to your bathroom . Oky , start turning left . tell me what you see . A mirror . I got him . She 's suppose to meet him at Cafe MicheeIe at 1 pm . What makes sure she does ?

I tried . Listen to me very carefully , I want you to say ... michael , as you still have the envelope , That mean it 's working , I know you 've switched the personal items , I helped . You leave me a note on the mirror . I suppose to take something from you , Something I can use to take at this Stephen , He is a man you worked with , he 's trying to fix the machine . Take the ... card . That was the ... for the campus , You suppose to give that to me . Look , michael , you can 't trust me right now . Then we 're lost , for good . I better get back . Wait here , I 'II be back after half an hour , And don 't worry . We 'II be together . michael , I Iove you . - What 's my favorite baseball team ? - What ? What 's my favorite baseball team ? Who cares ? Now we 're gonna leave . Wait . hold . You 've car ? - I might . - You might ? Look for BMW . You got to be joking . - Shit ! - Let me take that key . You 're in the wrong section .

Happy birthday to you , happy birthday to you , So sweet . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . I still don 't remember . Do you say he sent himself a different personal item ... Once it 's selected and after using the machine , nothing security will reflect . Everyday thinks combine to the power of foresight transformed michael from an engineer to an escaped artist . I don 't know ... micheal , are you okay ? Why ? ... what you saw ... but I remember few weeks ago you came back for me to the lab and you were pale . You asked me a strange question . What ? If I knew it won 't work out for you , Mic , before we were together would I 've done it ? What did you say ?

My Godness , I see the future is destroyed . ... they have no future . It takes away history , it takes away home . I 've to go back . I 've to destroyed the machine . It 's impossible . There got hundred of guards . I would not have given up three years we have it together I 'm absolutely sure I can get this thing work . - Okay , so how do we get in ? - We don 't . You say everything happens for a reason . And that includes me being here . So , come on . Another day the most . I don 't have anymore place to look . I thought you were smart , Stephen .
